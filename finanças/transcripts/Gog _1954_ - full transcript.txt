Send Pepe down to the biology lab for a blood count. Come on, Pepe. Floyd? Take Pepe to the biology lab for a blood count. Have six copies of the log typed out. And I'll want a more sensitive thermostat. -You'll find one in the supply room. -Yes, doctor. Doctor Kirby? Doctor Kirby? Doctor Kirby! Doctor Kirby! Help! Help! Doctor Kirby! Somebody help! Help! Doctor Kirby! Doctor Kirby! Help! Somebody help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Doctor Hubertus? Doctor Hubertus? -What happen? -Controls are jammed. -The Brain just took over. -The Brain? The giant brain machine that's guiding us in. Keeps the exact location of the area a secret. I've been here twice before and still don't know where I am. Suppose I watch the instruments? Wouldn't do you any good. The Brain magnetizes them too. Control 2 from Control 1. Helicopter approaching. Guiding in on beam four. Now passing through sector six. Please report helicopter approaching to Dr. Van Ness. Sun mirror. Yeah, focused on us, they could burn us to a crisp. A pleasant thought. Aircraft now descending. Open hangar. Altitude 100 feet. 90... 80... 70... 60... 50... 40... 30... 20... Thanks very much Al, I appreciate it. Dr. Sheppard? -Yes. -Dr. Van Ness is waiting for you. -Right this way, please. -Thank you. May I see your credentials, please? -Better check this in the file, Andy. -Right, Julie. Kill the light, Steve. Alright, Steve. Everything seems to be in order, Julie. Thank you, Dr. Sheppard. If you'll follow me, please. -How far do we go? -First level. Hundred feet down. -How many levels are there? -Four, not counting the hangar. The fourth level contains the atomic pile. The third, the NOVAC. -NOVAC? -The Brain. -What do you know about the brain machine? -It's not my job to know. Well, this is it. -You'll have to go alone. -Alright. Dr. Van Ness's office is right over there. Just stand in front of the door. -A photocell will indicate your presence. -Thank you. Come in, come in. You must be Dr. Sheppard. I'm Dr. Van Ness. I attended many of your lectures, Dr. Van Ness. Shows good sense, very good sense. Good to get rid of those. Here are my orders, sir. I requested your presence, Dr. Sheppard. Sit down. You enjoy a very excellent reputation. I asked for you particularly. -So you were with OSS. -During the war. -Then with H bomb security. -Not 'til last night. You're used to danger. I'm not, it confuses me and I... I can't afford to be confused. Our research work here is much too important. The security of the nation is at stake. Well, I must admit I haven't had much time for a briefing. Well, as you know from my teletype report, Doctor Hubertus... and his assistant were found dead in the cold chamber. Their bodies crystallized and shattered into hundreds of pieces. What kind of an experiment were they conducting? Hubertus believed that by pre-freezing the pilots... we'll be able to conquer space. A man kept frozen and refrigerated... could avoid the danger of space flight. Cosmic rays, meteors, lack of weight, and oxygen. The pull of gravity. But someone must operate the controls. Robots! How do you intend to bring these pilots back to life from their frozen condition? When the rocket arrives, radar beams thaw them out. -It's fantastic! -It worked! With animals. But Hubertus was murdered with his own machine. Did you consider equipment failure, Dr. Van Ness? No! I've positive proof there's a saboteur in my staff. I'd like to see the evidence. Joanna, will you please bring in the homing devices. Yes, sir. We're faced with extreme emergency. The lives of 150 top scientists are in danger. The best in the country, and I'm responsible for their safety. I want you to share this responsibility with me, Dr. Sheppard. Thank you. Joanna, this is Dr. Sheppard, of the Office of Scientific Investigation. Miss Merritt. -How do you do, Dr. Sheppard. -It's a pleasure, Miss Merritt. Can you recognize these gadgets? Miniature radar beacons. -Beautiful precision wor... -We found them hidden. They were sending out a signal in code. It's obvious they were designed to guide in a bomb. Where were they found? One was found among some equipment in the microchemistry lab, and the other in the commissary storeroom. How powerful would you say these were, Dr. Van Ness? Powerful enough to beam in a plane. Or a rocket with an atomic warhead. Yes, but we aren't at war. We weren't at war the night before Pearl Harbor. Aren't we safe this far underground? Yes, from an ordinary bomb. The project is buried in the desert... for security reasons. We're on four levels. Or five, counting the hangar where you landed in the helicopter. It's shaped like a wheel. With the elevator running down the center of the wheel. Now, if a ordinary bomb were dropped, our surface installations would be damaged, and possibly the hangar... and some of the elevator controls. With an atomic bomb... the first level would go to where we are now. And with a hydrogen bomb... the works! And a large part of the desert. Are there many people in the first level now? Almost everyone, it's noon. Well, I suggest you clear this level at once. But they're at lunch. Well, from now on, why not stagger them in shifts? Then if anything happens, your losses would be at a minimum. Yes, that was Major Howard's suggestion. And in view of the circumstances, I think it should be done. Is your staff aware of the impending danger? Only Major Howard, in charge of security. He found the devices. Good. If you don't mind, I'd like to take this transmitter. Then I'd like to become acquainted with your staff, and the work they're doing. Yes, certainly. Miss Merritt will as your guide and provide you with all necessary... protective equipment. This way, Dr. Sheppard. I'll meet you in the Helio lab in 10 minutes. -Major Howard? -Yes, Dr. Van Ness. Clear the first level. Then issue orders to the staff... they're to work, eat and sleep in three eight-hour shifts. At no time, I repeat, at no time... should there be more than one-third personnel on the first level. Key scientists, engaged in research... must remain below, at all times, until their work is complete. This order is urgent and immediate. -Do you have any questions? -No, sir. -But I have something to report. -What is it? About those code transmitters. Yes. We've found another one. All right, Joanna. Gold gives you access to all the laboratories, the only color that does. The rest of the staff has to have special permission to go from one level to another. It's made from specially impregnated material, sensitive to infrared rays. And any variation would be picked up on photoelectric cells and sound the alarm. -Are there any in here now? -No, not in the locker rooms. How's it been? Oh, David, it's maddening. -It's been such a long time. -It's been longer than that. So much has happened. So much has changed. Do you know what I keep thinking? -What? -It's silly. Mostly about slipping into a cocktail dress and waiting for you to ring the downstairs bell. Twenty-second street is a long way from here. This place is so inhuman. The machines took over. People aren't important. We live here like groundhogs. The world is a nightmare. Does anyone know you're from Security Section? Not even Van Ness. What did you find out? Nothing definite. Everyone's been thoroughly screened. But here's a list of names. That's about all. Doctor and Mrs. Elzevir, from Helio Engineering. Dr. Zeitman, electronics. Dr. Engle, cybernetics. Who are these people? Some of our key scientists. There's not a shred of evidence against them, but... they act a little stranger than the others. In what way? Well, Dr. Elzevir, for instance. He writes to a number of people in Europe. Have they been checked? Oh, his letters are screened. His contacts are mostly women. Sounds like a reasonable person. I noticed traces of dust on one of the transmitter tubes. It doesn't look like ordinary dust. I'd like to have it checked. This is your radiation badge, Dr. Sheppard. The sensitive film plate will turn red if you receive an overdose of radiation. I'm already exposed. The chemistry lab is on the second level, Dr. Sheppard. Marna? Oh, Joanna. Dr. Sheppard, I'd like you to meet Marna Roberts. Dr. Sheppard will be working with us for a while. A long while, I hope. How do you do. I hope I'm not disturbing you, Miss Reynolds. Not at all. Dr. Sheppard has a sample he'd like analyzed. Certainly, may I see it? -Could I have a slide, please? -Sure. Powder. -Any idea what he is? -Not the slightest. Looks like it might be metallic. Can you come back in a half hour? I'll have to photograph the spectrum then run the results through NOVAC. I'm beginning to think that NOVAC's indispensable. We'd be lost without it. -Thanks, we'll see you later. -Alright. We're to join Dr. Van Ness in here. -Helio Engineering. -Well, that's a new one. I've never seen sunlight under the ground. Doctor and Madam Elzevir are full of surprises. The beams of light are equidistant from the source. It's very interesting. I wonder what's keeping them? Oh, here you are. Joanna, turn the light on, will you please. -I want you to meet Dr. and Madam Elzevir. -How do you do. Hello. Over here, doctor, this is what I want you to see. This is what we've been working on. Man's first attempt to conquer space. So this is the space station. -The culmination of all our efforts. -It's fascinating. It's a scale model, one fifth of an inch to a foot. When it's in space it'll circle the Earth like another moon, a thousand miles up. Drawing it's power from the Sun with this. A miniature solar mirror. It's taken Dr. and Madam Elzevir years to perfect it. It's a work of genius. She's our nicest critic. -So the mirror is the only source of power? -That's right. The mirror collects the rays of the Sun and focuses them on this boiler tube which contains mercury. The mercury boils, converts water to steam, which in turn drives the dynamo, generating all the electrical power we need for light, heat, air conditioning and equipment. I see. In space, the Sun is visible twenty-four hours a day. There's no atmosphere to reduce its effectiveness. Let me show you what the Sun really looks like. This is our spectro-helioscope. It is the only one of its kind in the world. Above us, on the desert, a series of lenses, tracking the Sun, bringing its image down here to us. You can observe the nuclear explosions on the surface of the Sun. The Sun itself, however, is matted out by a blue filter disk. I can see the corona and the prominences. Like millions of hydrogen bombs exploding at once. Some of them are three hundred and fifty thousand miles long. Dr. Elzevir told me if we heat even a spec of iron to the temperature of the sun... it would radiate enough heat to blast all life within a radius of a thousand miles. The inner temperature is forty million degrees. Can we ever hope to develop such power? If we consumed the Earth's fuel... at the rate of the Sun's output, it would last only a matter of a few days. Particularly when you consider the Sun consumes... four million tons of matter a second. Four millions? Oh, don't worry, it's good for about another fifteen billion years. I'm glad to hear it. May I? Are those solar mirrors in actual operation? Yes, these are our working models. In space we would obtain light directly from the sun. Here we utilize the sun's rays from the heliostat. The mirror is a paraboloid, concentrating many rays into one intense focus. Very hot. This is the most startling perhaps. It's a good way to light a cigarette. Do you think so? Let us try it with a solid piece of steel. The switch, darling. It's more than startling, it's frighting. Yes, and consider a mirror anchored in space... it would be a powerful weapon of war. Compared to it, the atom bomb would be a toy. It's hard to believe that a mirror far out in space could harm the Earth. Withhold your opinion, Dr. Sheppard, you haven't seen the rest of the demonstration. Darling, the model. Right away, my sweet. I have such a wonderful assistant. Here is an industrial set on the shores of Lake Erie. Yeah, that would be a logical point of attack. It would indeed. All set, darling. Now watch the buildings. There you are... Two million people with one beam of light. This could actually happen? It most certainly could, and it probably will... if we are not the first to reach space. -What about the oceans? -Let me show you. Is your sun mirror in the desert a multi-refractive type? Yes, each little facet that makes up the surface of the mirror can be tilted so as to regulate the focus the Sun. Well, how do you change it, how do you change focus so quickly? I don't, NOVAC does. Via code transmitters. Naturally. Dr. Sheppard, perhaps you'd like to meet some of the people who will inhabit the space station. I wouldn't be surprised if you told me you had developed a super race. Maybe David... Dr. Sheppard, would like to see the rest of the project first. Miss Merritt, I trust you're not afraid of the competition. Well, certainly not, Dr. Van Ness. It's just that Dr. Sheppard seems so impressionable. You think so, my dear? Come along, the Human Factor's lab is next door. Dr. Carter, this is Dr. Sheppard. I want him to see your miracle chamber. Happy to meet you, Doctor. Miss Merritt, Pierre. It isn't exactly a miracle chamber perhaps. But in experimenting with weightlessness, we do achieve some very interesting things. Yeah, so I noticed. As a matter of fact, it's very interesting. Your enthusiasm is wonderful, Dr. Sheppard, but the experiment hasn't started yet. One can not always think of business, my dear. Perhaps you'll explain your work for us, Dr. Carter? Yes, of course. The test chamber is covered with wire mesh... enabling us to induce varying intensities of electromagnetic currents into the room. Subjects are wearing suits of alphenol, that's a new aluminum alloy, and it's easily magnetized. By changing the magnetic field in the chamber... we're able to produce any condition of gravity that we're apt to meet in space. How do you determine the effect on the subjects? Well, we put them through a vigorous workout at... various levels of weightlessness. Then we give them mental and physical tests... to see what effect lack of gravity has had upon them. I see. I'm going to reduce gravity so that they weigh about one third their normal weight. How far out in space would that be? About two thousand five hundred miles. The costumes are very nice. Why the girl? We think women are better suited for space travel than men. For one thing, they'll take up less room in a rocket. They're also better insulated against atmospheric changes. Is that why they wear nylons in cold weather? Don't you believe it, they do it to impress us. Now I'm adjusting their weight equal to fifty thousand miles in space. They should weigh no more than... fifteen or twenty pounds. I wouldn't like to be her boyfriend. In space there's no such thing as a weaker sex. That's why I like it here. Yes? Just a minute. It's for you, Dr. Van Ness. Well? What? I'll be there at once. It's Major Howard. He wants to see us immediately. This way, Dr. Sheppard. Very nice, very nice. Pierre, you're in the wrong department. My dear, a man has to have some kind of relaxation. But not that kind, come on. After you. -When did you first notice it? -Exactly fourteen minutes ago. -What was the frequency? -Thirteen thousand. -Decibels? -Seventy two. -And there was nothing on the radar screen? -No, sir. What is it, Major? Oh, Dr. Sheppard... -Major Howard, head of Security Control. -Major. You can speak freely. What's happened? Fourteen minutes ago, the sound detector began to vibrate. -You can still hear it. -This it here? That's right. Electronically controlled tuning forks. Pick up vibrations within a radius of a hundred miles. The pattern indicates that there's a jet plane in the vicinity... flying faster than sound, yet there's been no... Now it's stopped. Have you see anything on the radar screen? Nothing, except the helicopter, and last night's jet patrol. That's why I had you come up here, it happened once before. What about your ground observers? Anything from them? They've neither seen nor heard a plane since you came in this morning. There it is again. Frequency thirteen point five. Decibels increasing to danger point. Look! The chair! At this frequency, sound generates intense heat! Open your mouths! Everyone all right? I think so. That's the loudest it's been. -Did you see anything on the scope? -No, sir, nothing. -How high does your radar probe? -A hundred thousand feet. But no plane's ever gone that high! At least from our planet. Major Howard, I want you to instruct all ground observers to double the watch. Keep a look out for any flying objects: jets, rockets, perhaps a guided missile. -And, Dr. Sheppard... -Yes, sir? I didn't have a chance to tell you this before. We found another code transmitter... -in Dr. Zeitman's room. -Doctor Zeitman? He's next on my guided tour. Joanna? Control 2 from Control 1. I want a 24 hour look out at all observation posts. Doubled personnel. Keep a sharp watch for flying objects! Type unknown, altitude unknown! Even a bird, I don't care what it is, report it at once! That's Dr. Zeitman. Well, why can't we go in? He must be running a problem through the Brain. We have to wait until the light turns green. So this is NOVAC. Nuclear Operative Variable Automatic Computer. Quite impressive, isn't it? It was made in Switzerland. Took five years to build it. -Who designed it? -Doctor Zeitman did. G three. Program Pulse five. Accumulator eleven. Digit trey B. Into accumulator thirteen. Doctor Zeitman? I am extremely busy, Miss Merritt. Who is the gentleman with you? Dr. Sheppard, from Washington. To me, that is not a magic word... what do you want? He's here on official business. Dr. Van Ness would like him to become familiar with NOVAC. If you can do that, Dr. Sheppard, you're a genius. I've been trying for six years. You seem to be doing alright. This is a new field in science. We're only testing on the surface. What lies below is unpredictable. What's that? Oh, those are our robots. Gog and Magog! Robots? I consider them equal to NOVAC. A great achievement in electronic science. Wait. I'll show you. Engle, is Section Eleven clear? -Yes, sir. -I want you to activate Gog and Magog. -Tape? -Yes, it's a stored memory unit. In this case, NOVAC will take his instructions from the tape. Every punched hole represents a thought. Constant W, seven two one. Variant X. Constant W, seven two one. Variant X. A function B. Clear one one zero one. A function B. Clear one one zero one. Now watch. NOVAC will now give instructions to Gog, to move to that panel, adjust the dial to fifty thousand volts, wait five seconds, then turn it off. I've seen them in action before, it's always frightening. Science is never frightening, Miss Merritt. Magog is next. Magog will now move... to that work table, pick up the screwdriver, and hand it to the person holding out his hand. As Magog approaches, please step forward, extend your hand... and be prepared for a slight electric shock. Well... Dr. Sheppard? It's uncanny. What made it to come to me? Body heat. They are sensitive to infrared... and will approach whoever is closest. And electrocute him with the greatest of ease. We learned it from the rattlesnakes. Blindfold them... and they still find their prey. One day, Dr. Sheppard... my robots... will pilot our rockets... into space. Dr. Zeitman doesn't agree with us. He believes that humans will never travel in space. No matter what they tell you, man's inadequate body... will never be able to leave the Earth. -But now you must excuse me. -Oh, certainly. Thanks for the demonstration, Dr. Zeitman. Very interesting. Ah, Miss. Merritt, take him to the atomic pile. There he will see other variations of robot power. And when you go back to Washington... tell 'em what I have said. All this waste of money... on sun mirrors. Doctor Zeitman? Who empties these baskets? The janitors, of course. Well, this tape is coded. The code's secret. No janitor should have access to this tape. Every lab is equipped with a small electric furnace for disposal purposes. It's the regulation to use the furnace. Miss Merritt, I have no time to bother with regulations. Regulations can be important, Dr. Zeitman. At Oak Ridge we found a paper napkin in the commissary. Someone had scribbled an equation for the H-bomb on it. Dr. Sheppard, I am in charge here... and I'll decide what is important. You're not above the security of the nation, Dr. Zeitman. From now on... use the furnace as directed. Major, we just picked up something on the sound detector... flying over the crater at eighty thousand feet. Eighty thousand, that's the upper limit of our own rocket planes. I know, it was gone before we could identify it. In that case, I suggest you notify Air Defense Command. Check with them.. -Maybe it's one of our planes. -Yes, sir. Suppose it isn't? Only red or gold arm bands are allowed on the fourth level. Even then, we have to be checked by security. Do you know, this place could drag you down after a while. Fearing attack, living underground. It isn't a pleasant thought, but this could become the future of the human race. But David, that's why our project is so important. Once the space station has been launched, we'll have nothing to fear. Now, from this point on, the photoelectric cells sound a warning... if unauthorized personnel enter the corridor. Oh, and there are hidden television cameras along the ceiling. -Do you mean to say they're watching us? -All the time. They're interfering with my impulses. What impulses, Dr. Sheppard? Well, I can't mention them... 'cause they're unauthorized. -But they're nicely [unintelligible]. -Quiet. We're passing a microphone. -Why are they zig-zagged? -Dr. Zeitman's idea. Since radioactive particles travel in a straight line... this tunnel will prevent the spread of radiation. -Zeitman seems to be the number one genius. -NOVAC is. In case the solar mirror fails, the space... station would be powered by an atomic reactor. And this is the monitoring chamber. You can see through the red filtered port activities in various hot labs. Over here, for instance, isotopes. And here, plutonium compounds. Here, radioactive fuels. All handled by robot power. It used to take sixteen technicians to run a regular atomic pile. But now, with Dr. Zeitman's robots... everything is controlled by one man supervising NOVAC. You know, if one of the safety rods were pulled out by mistake it would... start a chain of reactions and the whole thing would explode. Well, what a pleasant surprise. Peter. This is Dr. Sheppard from the Office of Scientific Investigation. Dr. Peter Burden, our chief atomic engineer. -How do you do. -So this is your playpen? Well, we've nothing as exciting as upstairs... where they shrink heads with supersonic sound. -What about your robots? -Oh, they're lovely people... They work, they never get tired... never ask for a raise, never tell bad jokes, ideal companions! All I have to do is glance at this monitoring panel every 5 minutes. What do the different light changes mean? Oh, it's really quite simple. You see, the corridors on all levels... are rigged with high sensitive Geiger counters. Escaped radioactive particles show up here. Yellow means a harmless concentration. Violet gives warning to look for a radioactive source... and red spells danger. -Then the whole board is connected with... -Dr. Burden, the board!. Strong concentrations of alpha particles on the second level. The only level where nobody works with isotopes! Let's go, something's wrong. The chemistry lab! Better let me go first, it's pretty hot. Marna! Don't touch anything, stand back! Here, take the counter. Look at her badge, radioactive poison! I better get her out of here before everything is contaminated. Call Security Control. Let me have that. Give me Security Control. Send a decontamination team to the chemistry lab. Marna Roberts is dead. Geiger counter indicates 300 milliroentgen. Please hurry! There's our killer. A radioactive isotope. The problem is, who put it there? -And why in the chemistry lab? -I think I know. I gave Marne some metallic dust to analyze. She's dead, the dust is gone, the analyzer smashed. It's obvious someone didn't want us to know what it was. -Where did you find this dust? -On one of the transmitter tubes. Anyone else know about it? No, only Marne and I. Dr. Van Ness's office. It's for you, doctor. Yes. Yes! Very well, thank you. That was Major Howard. They just picked up a plane on the sound detector. It was flying over the project. He just checked with Air Defense Command. They've have no planes in the air, since yesterday. What do you think? After what's happened, I don't know what to think. Joanna. Can you remember anybody else... who might have known about that metallic dust? -Maybe Vince. -Who's Vince? Our human subject. Marna and Vince were in love, and Vince was around the lab a lot. I better see this Vince. -Will you take this, please? -Surely. Peter. You've been with us a long time, haven't you? I know what you're thinking, Doctor Van Ness. This radioactive material. I'm the only one who has access to anything like that. I keep it under lock and key. Then who could possibly have taken it? Someone who knows everything we know, Dr. Van Ness. You again? Things are a little slow. So you thought you'd drop in, I know. I always enjoy the human factor's tests. Especially when the human is a female. You sound just like my wife. What are you up to this time? I've got to test two new pressure suits. Why are you using the spin table? Well, I'm going to simulate the effect of gravity with centrifugal force. Ah, something like conditions would be on the space station. That's right. You ready? Right! -Check your oxygen. -Check! Now we evacuate the air from the chamber. Take them up to about 40,000 feet. How many revolutions can they take? Well, the suits are designed to operate at a gravity... equivalent to 5 revolutions per second. We're gonna see if we can take them up to 10. Everything okay? -Check. -Altitude 70,000. 80,000. I'm getting dizzy! Revolutions 5... 6... 7... 90,000. Can they take it? Without those suits, their blood would boil. I'm taking you up to 10 revolutions. Flash a red light if anything should go wrong. -I'm glad I'm not in there. -Please, Elzevir, please. 9... 10. Revolutions now 10. -How long can they take 10? -Not more than 60 seconds. Attention, all personnel! Attention, all personnel! Urgent, cancel all experiments at once! Department heads report to Dr. Van Ness immediately. Sounds like an emergency. Experiment over, I'm slowing you down. What is it? -The control wheel, it's stuck. -They're over 10 revolutions! -Do something! -I can't! I can't stop the wheel! It's stuck! The control circuits, try the control circuits! The table's slowing down. Atmosphere, increase atmosphere. -It still works. -What happen, what's wrong? -The spin table! -Can we go in there yet? No, no, we got to bring them back slowly... Vince! Hurry up, they look unconscious! Here's the oxygen. Take the oxygen! Let's go! It's no use. He's dead. Heart action stopped. She was so young. I don't understand. The safety valves... What happened to the safety valves? Dr. Carter, could it possibly have been an accident? I checked the controls inside the panel. They were fused together by intense heat. Maybe it was a ray of some kind, a high frequency wavelength. An ultrasonic beam would not be selective. What about a defective power supply? The damage was done by a blowtorch. Burned resistors, fused controls. They all indicated the same source. Sounds like the work of a maniac. Not a maniac, Dr. Burden. We have in our midst a clever calculating killer. From now on, security control will be tightened. If you ask me, it's tight enough already. I can't even go to the commissary without being followed. Consider yourself lucky to have a bodyguard, doctor. Say, Elzevir... your wife was quite jealous of you, wasn't she? What kind of a statement is that? She had no love for the young girl, did she? -It would have been very easy for her to... -Shut up. We didn't ask you here to make accusations. Everyone's under suspicion. I am sorry. Doctor Elzevir, where is your wife? In the Helio lab. My recommendation is for all of you to keep working in pairs. Be extremely careful! And if anything else happens, sound the alarm immediately. Dr. Sheppard is right. We're approaching the deadline on our space station project. Work must continue, no matter what the circumstances. That's all, gentlemen. Ninety-two decibels! It's increasing! -Ground observers? Radar? -Nothing! Wait a minute! Must be a rocket plane flying over radar range! The same frequency! Get out of here, all of you! At this intensity, sound can kill! Get out! Get out! Howard! Come on! How do we open this? We can't, you can only open it from the inside! Help me get him on the floor. He's dead! Call Control 2! Have them send some men up here! Get Control 2 on the phone, get some men up here, and restore order. [Unintelligible] I think I know what it is now, Joanna. Come on, we're going to see Dr. Zeitman. Engle! Get up on your feet! Look! What is it Where's Magog? Magog? What did you do with him? Well, nothing... I never activate the robots unless you order it. It doesn't make sense... -Where...where'd he go? -Well, you know as well as I do that... Magog cannot move without NOVAC! NOVAC was active. Turned the power off myself, to work on it. -Somebody must have carried him off! -Oh, don't be be silly... who can lift up 600 pounds of metal? Why didn't you sound the alarm? I don't understand it... how could it happen? I was working on NOVAC! Did you leave the laboratory? Not for a minute. Magog is gone? You didn't even notice? I don't understand it, I... -How could it happen? -You said that before! -Doctor Zeitman! -What is it? Major Howard's just been killed in Security Control. I think I know why, maybe you can tell me how. I'm sorry to hear the news... but I have my own problems. Magog is missing! Missing? Let me ask you something, Dr. Zeitman. There's a connection between NOVAC and the solar mirror, right? NOVAC plots the codes. And the same thing goes for the Human Factors lab and the Cold Chamber lab? Everything coordinated by microtransmitters, like this one. Yes. What are you driving at, Dr. Sheppard? The man who controls NOVAC has committed six murders. I am sorry, Dr. Sheppard, your theory is excellent, except for one thing: NOVAC was inactive when Magog disappeared. The power was turned off. With the power off, NOVAC couldn't have given the orders. Maybe NOVAC didn't, but someone else did. What do you mean, Dr. Sheppard? A jet plane, unidentified, has been flying around over the base. I'm convinced that someone up there has been beaming an ultra high frequency ray into the project. The same ray that's caused the tuning forks to vibrate, and the code transmitters to receive. It's possible, it can be done. They must have learned how to control NOVAC! That's why we haven't been able to find our killer. -Where's your phone? -Over there. That's NOVAC! Get Security Control, hurry! Get me Security Control! -Doctor Zeitman! Gog has been activated! -Engle, quick! Open the panel, smash the tubes! Engle, look out! He's getting impulses from an outside source! Doctor Zeitman! Zeitman, help me! You'd... Zeitman, get back! I'm not afraid of him, he's following body heat. -How do I stop it? -Fire! Fire at the tubes! The tubes on his head! The glass is too thick. -Can you use a flamethrower? -Yes! Make him burn, it's the only way to stop him! Type X2, in the storeroom down below! Hurry up! David! The atomic pile! Magog must be down there! If he pulls out the safety rods, it'll explode! Get me Dr. Van Ness, hurry! Dr. Van Ness, Sheppard speaking! I'm in the elevator with Joanna. NOVAC's being controlled by an outside source, Gog just killed Zeitman and Engle. David! Magog is in the atomic pile! Burden was injured, but managed to get out and sound the alarm. We've got to stop those robots! Smash 'em, do anything! There's only one thing to do! That jet that's been flying over the project... it must be controlling the robots by a high frequency beam! Give Air Defense Command NOVAC's operational frequency... and if it leads to the plane, shoot it down! We're heading for the pile! Can you hold off the robots until we get there? We got a flamethrower, with this we'll try! -Lieutenant! -Yes sir! Get me Air Defense Command. This is an emergency. The safety rod! Control 2 from Control 1, have jet aircraft in sight. Fox Kite from Yearling Leader. Standing by for fox hunt, over. Fox Kite to Yearling Leader, roger. Steer 275. Yearling Leader, steering 275. David! David, the safety rod! Why doesn't it stop? It's alright, it's over. It's over. We're out of fuel! David! David! The open tubes in the back, smash them! David! Adjust your mixture! I can't, I can't! The valve's stuck! Get back! Get back! We crippled it, but what made it stop? They must have destroyed the plane. Are you alright? I think so. David, I... I think we should... -Joanna! -Look at her badge... She's received an overdose of radiation. So have you. Let's get her to the hospital, quick! -Joanna. -Hello, David. You know, it's a fine time to be waking up. -What happened? -You'll be alright. The doctor says it isn't serious, just a little too much radiation. -How do you feel? -Much better. Hold my hand. You have a nice hand. Nice, friendly hand. But I don't feel exactly... friendly. Neither do I, David! How do you feel now? Radiant! The President demanded an immediate explanation. What am I going to tell him? I'm sorry to say, Mr. Secretary, but our enemies were smarter than we were. But how did they control the brain machine, the robots? High frequency electronics. A radio wave? NOVAC was constructed in a neutral country, in Europe. At the time, enemy agents built into it... a powerful transmitter... and receiver. Sounds fantastic! Every time you ran a problem through the Brain, it was... transmitted to that rocket plane, flying overhead. I wonder how much information leaked out through NOVAC? We are checking the memory units now. We'll have to give them credit. They were devilishly clever. But why didn't this rocket ship show up on radar? It was made of fiberglass. Extremely light and strong. And it is your assumption that their planes can... fly faster and higher then anything we've got? -Not exactly. -What do you mean? The project is still on schedule. Our space station will travel... at an altitude of a 1,000 miles above the Earth. Several years from now, perhaps. -Tomorrow. -What? We've completed a smaller model. We'll shoot it into space, in a rocket. You can't be serious! I am. I don't recall our discussing any such move, Dr. Van Ness. No, but the committee gave me full authority to handle the project as... as I saw fit. A practical model was a necessity! If it works, and becomes a satellite of the Earth... then we know we can send man into space. A baby space station. Actually, a flying television set. The station will circle around the Earth, and through its eye... we'll be able to see everything that takes place on this tired old world. Perhaps bring it new life. A new dignity. Nothing will take us by surprise again. When do you launch this space station? In the morning, Mr. Secretary. In the morning. When the air is fresh and crisp and clean.
