May l know... who is not feeling well? It's my daughter A doctor must meet the patient And diagnose, according to her... Complexion, voice, symptoms and pulse. What might be the reason for her sickness? She wishes to attend a school in Hangzhou I refused, so she is unhappy and sick I really wish you could cure her It's certainly a queer illness! Queer illness! However, there is a cure for it But the ingredients are hard to come by As long as it cures my daughter...

Since she wants to studying Hangzhou... Please let her! Once you give your consent... I think she will be cured at once. It's bad for a girl to mix among men l won't allow it! I have a plan which would be safe enough What is your plan? Let her dress as a man I don't think she would fare any less If she is dressed as a man, I'll bet no one would know she is a girl. Even her parents won?t recognize her. You exaggerate so! I've raised her up myself I don?t think l won't recognize her Absolutely! We sure would be able to No, you can't! If we can't, then we will let her go! On your word of honor? Yes, on my honor Thank you, Father! It's you?! Yes, your daughter Ying-tai You both failed to recognize her Nonsense, that was a trick!

My sister is ambitious Wants to compete with men She discards rouge for ink and pen And prefers literature to jewels She wished to come along with me... so that we could study together But Father is a bit orthodox minded Girls can?t leave the boudoir! You are right! Men and women are born equal Such man-made rules are absurd I had thought all men are alike But he stands up for women?s rights!

I don't mean you It's the book! Men and women are both humans... Women are the root of trouble Haven?t you heard this saying before? Women are the root of trouble! Why... My dear brother... Many kingdoms were ruined due to them Listen to this, brother! Mei-xi ruined the Xia Emperor Jie Shang's King Zhou was marred due to Da-ji Zhou's Emperor You set off beacons... just to amuse his beloved Bao-si These are the teachings of wise sages We ought to give it careful thought... before deciding I'm wrong Brother Liang, please listen to me Many great women lived in the past Listen carefully to what I say Goddess Nu-wa mended the sky for us Queen Lei fed silk worm with mulberry Worthy mothers are also famous Like the mother of Mencius Those bad kings ruined themselves And put the blame on their women You don't digest what you study And can?t tell right from wrong Please excuse me for being so frank You are indeed a bookworm I'm enlightened.

Brother, please go and rest There's no need to stand on ceremony Tonight, I'll stay with you I can attend to all your needs Yin-xin, sleep in the outer chamber Master Liang, you are an educated man How can you say something like this? What do you mean? How can boys and girls sleep together! Are you implying that I'm a girl? Since you are not a girl... How can I ask you to take care of me? I'll do anything for my brother Even hard manual work Yin-xin, you may retire I?ll take over your duty tonight That makes it worse I'm used to sleeping alone If you insist to stay the night... Please at least use another blanket! All right, I'll do as you say Yin-xin, go and fetch my blanket Yin-xin, do as Master Liang says It's time to take a bath Let's go What for?

All right See, it's all done Fantastic, better than a girl's work I helped you but you make fun of me Sorry, sorry! Time flies by like a shooting arrow Three years have gone by swiftly Liang Shan-bo and Zhu Ying-tai Their friendship is deep as the sea One loves to talk and discuss politics The other is devoted to the former Three years have gone by in a wink Spring comes and goes once again What are you staring at? My dear brother! Ying-tai is not a girl Why then are her ears pierced?! I have a reason for that Why are you so suspicious? In the annual festival of our village... I always play the Goddess of Mercy Concentrate on your studies Don't let your mind wander off to girls I daren?t look at the Goddess anymore Master Master, the teacher sends for you Luckily I?ve finished the composition Wait here, I'll be right back Sure Miss, a letter again from the Squire They want us to go back? Is it? It says mother is seriously ill So difficult to decide! Let's go then It's easier said than done! Don't want to leave Master Liang? You little girl! Maybe you should talk to Mrs. Meng What for? Tell her the truth And ask her to be the matchmaker I?m too shy to... What are you staring at? It'd be so embarrassing! Isn't that true! What a sissy! I believe it's time to leave Thank you, Mrs. Meng Have a seat Thank you Better go home if your mother's sick I'll inform your teacher when he's back Thank you, Mrs. Meng Mrs. Meng Anything else? No, nothing... Ying-tai, don?t be shy Just tell me what's bothering you Mrs. Meng! I'm grateful to learn from Teacher And you too, for all your kindness Since I studied with Brother Liang... It's been three years already. Three whole years! I have a secret... Don?t be shy, I'm like your mother Just say it I am... I am a girl dressed as a boy I've known that for a long time Since you've known it all along... I needn't be shy There is so much I want to say But I?ll just use this jade bracelet Please give it to Brother Liang... As a token of our betrothal You are as pretty as flowers And Shan-bo's future is bright You two are a perfect match I'm really glad I can help... To match you two together Thank you, Mrs. Meng After three years studying together... Shan-bo hates to let Ying-tai go. When I first came to school here The scenery is so beautiful We met and became sworn brothers In that span we came to be quite close Now your father wants you to go home You must hurry up I wish you a peaceful journey! I will never forget your kindness... in escorting me such a long way. Who tends to your mother when you study? Why don?t you get married? I am only devoted to my studies In books, I find my love You are from a noble family You must have betrothed already I don't know how to answer him He doesn't know I'm a girl! I so wish to tell him the truth When I remembered father?s advice To think carefully before I act So I hold back the words We were saying... I am still too young to marry Today's weather is divine We should not waste time Let's recite poems on the way I am crude and unlearned I'm afraid I can't match your talent You are being too modest! It's hard to recite without a subject Let's recite about the fine scenery I see a woodcutter hurrying by With sweat running down his back For whom is he toiling so hard? For whom are you walking down hill? He is toiling for his wife And I'm seeing you off, my brother Wrong! Why? He is toiling for his brother And you?re seeing your wife off I'm not yet married Your words don?t make any sense We've arrived at the fish pond Golden carps swim by in pairs Like flounders, they hate to part So are the two brothers Why are you sighing, brother? Look at the fishes in the pond They loathe to part Only hook and bait... can part them How nice if we could be those fish Look A soft breeze drifts across the water A pair of mandarin ducks glides near Back and forth they sail together They're in love with each other Brother Liang, if I were a girl Would you want to marry me? Marry you! But you are not a girl, right! Passing mountains after mountains We've come to Phoenix Hill Here, flowers bloom everywhere Too bad, peony isn't here though! Do you like peony? There is a lot of peony in my garden Come over to my house if you want some Oh, I do love Peony But it?s such along way to your home How can I go there just for flowers? Brother, pick the flowers while in bloom Don't wait till there are no more Right ahead is a river A pair of geese is swimming by The gander is in front The goose follows, calling "Brother!" I've not heard a sound at all How can a goose call a gander? Don?t you see the goose smiling? She thinks you are an idiotic gander If I am an idiotic gander... Don't ever call me brother anymore Right ahead is a narrow bridge I am scared and trembling Let me help you across We are like the Cowboy and Spinning Maid Resting in Goddess of Mercy?s temple The boy and girl attendants stand by They look like a perfect couple Who is to act as their matchmaker? How could they be a couple? They can't? Look, who is he? It's moon, the proverbial matchmaker! If he is the matchmaker... Why doesn?t he unite the two? Matchmaking is difficult Only lovers should be united They are made from wood and earth They don't know what love is Brother Liang, they love each other They just can't express it Goddess of Mercy will unite them Let's perform the ceremony for them That's nonsense, brother How can two men get married? We now arrive at the pond We can see our reflections in it Destiny brings us together from afar Without affinity, we wouldn?t have met Look at the reflections in the water A boy and a girl smile at each other I am a man inside out You shouldn't... You may compare me to a woman After the pond we come to a village In the village, dogs are barking They don?t bite the man in front But bite the girl who follows! Nonsense, brother! There isn?t any girl here Be brave, don?t be afraid I'll chase the dog away for you An ox is coming this way A buffalo boy is riding on its back Singing all his worries away But the ox doesn?t understand What a pity, Brother Liang You're as dumb as an ox! I'm angry and not without reason I'm a man but you call me an ox A big dumb ox! Don?t be angry, Brother Liang! I apologize to you, please forgive me Thank you for seeing me off Here we must bid a sad farewell I have a question on my mind Are you betrothed? I come from a poor family How can I be betrothed without money? I haven't even finished my studies How can I be betrothed? Since you are not betrothed... I have a younger sister at home. If you're desirous of getting married... I'll be your matchmaker. She is faraway and I can't see her I'm sure she must be pretty and young We are very similar She looks exactly like me For she and I are twins Thank you, matchmaker! Thank you for being so thoughtful So that's why you kept uttering nonsense You want to match me with your sister But was too stupid to realize it I don't know when we will meet again! Take good care of yourself There is so much I wish to say! These are the last words I'll repeat Come soon to Zhu's villa for her Master Zhu Lingering for the departure Zhu Ying-tai holds back her tears She has so much on her mind Hoping Liang will come for her soon I think of you day and night Days seem endless after we part Do you know I'm lying sick in bed? I feel chilly in the starry night Mrs. Meng, thank you! You are not yourself these days What's wrong? I've... been thinking about... home Then you should go home for a while That won't be necessary... Go to sleep I have something to tell you What is it? Smilingly I ask the bookworm Something bizarre for you to guess Is he really a boy or a girl? Whom are you talking about? Ying-tai, whom you spent 3 years with There is nothing bizarre about it How could Ying-tai be a girl? You're merely teasing me I maybe a bookworm but not a fool She came into my room before she left She was shy and reluctant to speak She used a jade bracelet as a token Asking me to be her matchmaker Ying-tai has a sister like himself He wanted me to marry her He told me everything before he left Thank you Mrs. Meng, for your effort Ying-tai is really a girl She confessed before me Who would tell you directly about it? You are really a foolish bookworm Is Ying-tai really a girl? Of course! Ying-tai... is a girl?! Then Ying-tai is her own sister Her sister is Ying-tai! We spent 3 years together How could this be? Then she has betrothed herself to me? She has betrothed herself to me! Since you two are engaged... You should go to her at once Tell the Teacher tomorrow and go to her Shan-bo wants to call on Ying-tai He leaves school and is on his way To visit Ying-tai at Zhu's villa Everything is like before Pleasant memories came flashing back I'd never imagined him to be a girl Leave the city, pass the gate She said I was walking for my wife She said the fish were like brothers After the hill, when we came to the pond She said mandarin ducks formed a pair She already had our marriage in mind then! Phoenix Hill, Phoenix Hill Peony awaits in her garden Oh, geese in the river I was really an idiotic gander! We're like Cowboy and Spinning Maid... The marriage ceremony in the temple... Reflection of boy and girl in water... The dog biting the girl... All these things I couldn't guess I'm really a big dumb ox! And I'm a little dumb ox! In the shadow of the willow She betrothed me to her sister But she IS actually her sister! Ying-tai, this sure is a good match You did the right thing! Taking out my betrothal token Happily I put it away again Sooner I arrive, sooner we?ll meet The bridal sedan will be on its way Hurriedly travel on I wish I had wings to fly to her side Miss... Master Liang's matchmaker is here! How do you know? Why wouldn't I know? Just now, I was at the front door I saw an old woman leaving The guard said she came to see Squire About matchmaking matter She must've been sent by Master Liang! Don?t tease me I am not, it's true! No wonder the candle wick burst That means something goodwill happen Yes, something good did happen! Father, Mother Squire, Madam I was just thinking about your future When a matchmaker came to me It is really something good! You've grown up and should be married This is a god sent perfect match I have already given my consent What do you say? Do you know who the boy is? Father, who is the boy? This is an extraordinary event You must have heard of him! He is Mandarin's son, Ma Wen-cai How do you like it? What? I won't marry him! Why? It's a perfect match Everybody knows that... Mais a playboy How can you believe these rumors? I cannot obey you Where is your filial piety? I'd rather serve you at home Nonsense! Everyone must get married If I marry, I won't marry Ma Wen-cai Now I know When you were in Hangzhou, did you... Yin Xin, you served her at school for3 years What happened there? Speak up Just tell the truth, Yin-xin When Miss went to school in Hangzhou She and Liang Shan-bo became friends Before we left, she... Speak up! Miss pledged the hand of her sister... Ying-tai, you... No wonder she won't listen to reason She has found a lover herself And refused to a perfect marriage You're breaking your father's heart! Since the beginning of universe... No girl ever chooses her own husband The Ma family is rich and influential Liang Shan-bo can never match our families Father Shan-bo and I are in love I really can't marry Ma Wen-cai I have already promised the Ma's Betrothal to be sent without delay I've also made up my mind, father... You disobedient girl! Miss! Don?t lose your temper Let me persuade her I don't care. You have to obey me Mother... My dear, you know your father well It'd be better if you give in Mother... Father has made a big mistake He shouldn?t have betrothed me to Ma's Ever since I returned home... I have told you everything My dear mother... The Ma family is rich and influential Father can?t go back on his word And you cannot fix your own alliance Your behavior will create a scandal You'd better obey your father Like a plum blossom takes wind and snow A phoenix cannot marry a common crow I don't care how powerful Ma's are I'll marry him only if... the sun rises in the west Ying-tai! Madam, what should we do now? Liang Shan-bo should have come sooner This way please Miss, Master Liang is here! Liang Shan-bo, Zhu Ying-tai They meet again One is thrilled and joyful The other is filled with sadness Si-jiu Please leave Yes Yin-xin Serve tea for Master Liang Sure Miss Brother Liang! I am your brother's friend I'm here to visit him. Is he here? Brother Liang, look carefully You... I am Ying-tai! I disguised as a man to go to school We met and became sworn brothers These 3 years, you took care of me I am really grateful to you We called each other brothers then Now... You are dressed as a girl What should I call you? You used to call me brother Now, just address me as sister Yes, my sister Brother Liang Please take a seat Yes, please sit down too Master Liang, have some tea How've you been after we parted? Very well. How about you? I am all right too Passing through here, is it? I'm here to visit your parents And to see your sister My sister? Listen, sister The other day when I saw you off... You said you?d be my matchmaker For the hand of your sister I'm here to propose marriage Brother Liang Do you know who my sister is? It's the same Ying-tai It's you? Liang Shan-bo and Zhu Ying-tai Were destined by Heaven to wed Their love is true They'll always be together But my father has given me... Had the words barely left her mouth... She fled to her boudoir in tears If she didn't intend to keep her word... Why did she pretend to be matchmaker? Yin-xin! Tell me To whom has her father betrothed her? To that dandy Ma Wen-cai Brother Liang Ying-tai! You... We swore eternal love I have only you in my heart Your father betrothed you to Ma You should've refused at once I have done my best... To refuse his proposal But my father won't hear it He can't break the betrothal So, he won't? Your father won't break the betrothal But my bridal sedan will come first I'll invite our Teacher's wife To sit in Zhu villa's parlor We two are betrothed as well Jade bracelet and butterfly pendant Why can?t we become husband and wife? Jade bracelet and butterfly pendant Butterflies should fly in pairs We two have chosen ourselves Others don?t recognize it Even though they don?t recognize it I still want to live and die with you Your words wring my heart Tears flow down my cheeks Brother Liang, you are the only son Your elderly mother depends on you I'm not blessed to find happiness You'd better find someone else Even if it?s a Heavenly angel, I won't love I am leaving Brother Liang You came here to visit me There is nothing more I can say I'll pour you a goblet of wine I never knew I'm here only for wine! Brother Liang It was love at first sight And it grew during those three years I left the jade bracelet as a token To be given to you by Mrs. Meng When you saw me off... I tried to let you know my heart I told you about reflections in water I proposed to wed before the Goddess Who would have known all was in vain? A pair of mandarin ducks is separated My father has betrothed me to Ma's My heart is broken, all hope gone What else can I say to my friend? What else can I say to an old friend? I thought our love can unite us Who knew strong winds separate us To whom can I pour my heart out? From whom can I seek sympathy? Awakened abruptly from sweet dreams! All love thoughts shattered to bits I dare not trail the road we traveled Lest I come by the same mandarin ducks! My brother Liang! I have wronged you Not because I'm heartless Only because I can't disobey father Brother Liang! I cried for you From evening till morning For you I traveled here fast Not minding fatigue or sweat I was angry at father because of you Jeopardizing my relationship with him My heart is broken because of you Nothing can mend it again Promise is broken, a token rendered useless All my hopes have vanished My heart is on fire but hands are cold I'm returning the jade to you now Bid you farewell with swallowed tears You're not well, how can you travel? I have to even if I can't How can I die in your house? Brother Liang, don?t take it too hard Take care of your health We can still be friends When will you come to visit me again? If I live on, I will certainly come If not, we won't meet in this world Go to find me in my grave Find the grave And carve two names on it Liang Shan-bo and Zhu Ying-tai We can't marry now, in death we will Liang Shan-bo and Zhu Ying-tai They can?t become man and wife In death, they will never part Even death won't part us both Ying-tai, Ying-tai! Shan-bo, it's time for medicine Si-jiu, Si-jiu He is not back yet Mother, will Ying-tai come? She will. Drink this first Medicine can't cure me I think I am dying! You are not... Mother, you've loved me in vain Shan-bo, don't say such things, dear Sorry that you'd have to see me die I can only repay you in my next life For all you've done for me Shan-bo She didn't come with you? Master, she is already Ma's wife She's asked you to take care of yourself Yes, you must take care of yourself What did she say about my letter? She cried and gave you this This means that till death do us part But in this life, we cannot wed Master Shan-bo... Master! Mother, bury me by the Southern Mountain Shan-bo, don?t be silly Give this to Miss She will have this to remember me by Silk thread ends only when the worm dies Even in death I will not give up - Shan-bo... - Master... Ying-tai... - Master... - Shan-bo... Miss, the bridal sedan is here Please get ready Oh, Heavens! Miss! Master, he is... How is he? He is dead... Miss! Miss! Brother Liang! With tears I call out your name I call you, Brother Liang We had hoped to unite... But were torn apart Our farewell was eternal I have caused your death Father's orders were strict The Ma's are vicious Brother Liang! Though our love dreams have perished... I will follow you Even into Hell! Si-jiu, before your Master left... Did he say something for me? He told me to give you this To remind you of him This... Is his blood... He died calling your name Poor brother Liang, it's tragic! Has he been buried yet? By the road near Southern Mountains Southern Mountains...! Si-jiu, go home Prepare offerings And wait for me by the grave Miss, you...? Please don?t ask anymore Go now Yin-xin, see him off Yes Squire, Madam Respects to Squire, Madam The bridal sedan is here Why don?t you help Miss prepare? He is already dead What's there to prepare? What did you say? Squire Master Liang has died! Why haven't you still awakened? This is the will of God Today is your big day Forget the trivial things Father, you're taking it too lightly... Ying-tai The wedding sedan is here; waiting It is too late to go back on it There is no need to back out I never agreed to it in the first place Ying-tai, you... Now, be calm! Marriages are decided by parents Your father has consented to it How can he change it now? The Ma's are rich and influential That's their business My heart has always been with Liang Alive we couldn?t unite, by death we'll I'd rather die than be with the Ma's How preposterous! Would you say father has wronged you? Father, are you forcing me? The wedding sedan is already at the door All right, I'll obey you... That's like a good girl! But, on one condition... What is it? At the front of sedan I want mourning lanterns And joss sticks behind for sacrifice The procession takes a southern route For I want to visit Shan-bo's grave Today is your wedding day How can you go visit Shan-bo's grave? It's impossible No bride ever goes to a grave first It's absurd! It's nonsense! If you won't agree to this... I will not enter the sedan Time's running short, just let her I mean, how could I allow? Let her visit the grave The wedding could be later at the Ma's This... All right! You've really made me mad All right now...! Brother Liang...! You have left me forever We can't spend our lives together I thought we're meant for each other But fate has been cruel to us I hoped you would send a matchmaker But crows brought bad news instead I hoped you?d also bring an orchestra But our bridge of love was broken I hoped you'd fetch me in your sedan But I've come to mourning instead! Brother Liang... I can't see you but only your grave All my pleas won't bring you back Ying-tai will never change her mind I will never marry Ma Wen-cai Brother Liang! Alive we couldn?t unite, by death we will Flowers bloom under rainbow bridge Butterflies flutter in pairs Time goes by but their love won't die That's Liang Shan-bo and Zhu Ying-tai Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
