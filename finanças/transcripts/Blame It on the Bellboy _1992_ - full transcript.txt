Hhor-- horton? Yes? Horton ! With a "h"? Yes ! - I have a big surprise for you. - Look, mate -- Rosemary ! Maurice. Thank you. You've been a great help. [ Door closing ] What on earth are you wearing? What? What are you doing here, Rosemary? What do you think I'm doing here, darling? I was shopping in Sainsbury's and guess who I met by the frozen fish? That girl that works in your branch, Amanda -- - stainrod? - Amanda stainrod. "Good heavens, Mrs. Horton," she said. "Back already?" "Back already?" I said. "From venice," she said. Ha-ha. "How was it?" I'm not gonna stand in Sainsbury's and tell the whole town... That their mayor goes on holiday without his wife. And as far as I'm concerned, he was at a financial conference in buxton. "Very nice," I said. "It was very nice." Look, Rosemary -- so I went home and thought... Why should Amanda bloody stainrod think you're in venice... While I think you're in buxton? "Ah, simple, Rosemary," I thought. - "It's another woman." - Rosemary ! What I should be telling the whole town, of course, is that their mayor is away, at ratepayers' expense, having a bit of adriatic slap and tickle. Look, Rosemary, you've got it all wrong. [ Toilet flushing ] Now, this is going to look odd, Rosemary. Oh, hello. [ Maurice ] Ahem. This is my wife, Rosemary. Oh, hi. Welcome to venice. Oh, thank you. I thought you said your wife was staying in england. I thought you didn't want her to know anything about this? Looks like the cat's out of the bag now. Hello, I'm Caroline Wright, veni villas estate agency. Your husband and I -- I'm sorry, his lordship and I... Were just finalizing the details on a villa he's buying. - A villa ! - Yes. His lordship was very keen to get his hands... On at least one of my properties, and being a man in his position, he wanted it kept fairly hush-hush. We guarantee absolute discretion. He can rest assured that I won't tell anyone what he's been up to out here. Maurice, is this true? [ Caroline ] I'd better say my arrivedercis. So, you'll arrange for that specified amount? In cash, Italian lire? Tomorrow, like we said? And the keys to the lovely villa Romano will be yours. I'll call you tomorrow and we can make a date, as it were. Ciao. Ohh. Ciao. Oh ! Oh, Maurice. I'm sorry. What a wonderful, wonderful surprise ! Yeah. It suits you, that shirt. You're one of those hit men, aren't you? A killer, a paid killer, like Edward fox in "day of the jackal." Why should you want to kill me? Oh my god ! Look, it says medi-date. It's a dating agency. You're supposed to fall in love, not get shot at. Look at the top... Medi-date ! You don't ask questions in my job. It's about time you started. I suppose you're going to keep me here. I know too much. I know too much? I don't know anything ! This Maurice horton, this assassin, he's gonna die, you know that. Well, I -- I didn't until you just told me, no. I'm not interested in that. All I want to do... Is look around the villa. If I don't do that, I'm out of a job. That's all I care about. Dead men don't need jobs. [ Scarpa ] When Maurice horton dies... You know who's-a killed him. Yes, I do, I -- okay, but... Can we just pretend I don't? That's not-a the way we do things. Tell-a me, when-a this-a pig dies, and-a he will die, how can we guarantee your silence? Well, I -- I mean guarantee ! I tell-a you, there are two ways. Numero uno, we kill-a you off. Silence a guarantee, no? Oh. What is numero two-o, duo -- due ! Due. You kill him. Of course, we will pay you big money... So it'll look voluntary, si? [ Gasping ] - We are not so unreasonable. - I, i-- [ sigh ] They thought Mike lawton was Michael horton. Let's talk about this later. I'd have thought you'd have chosen something... More mysterious. Lawton's a bit ordinary, isn't it? It's meant to be ordinary. Fine, it's just that in the books they're not so boring. What are you suggesting? I don't know. I'm not a killer, am I? I read one once where the -- look, you have got to learn to give your mouth a rest. This is secret business, serious. I don't want the whole bloody world to know ! [ Patricia ] Oh, look. There she is ! That must be him. God, he's no Clark gable, is he? [ Maurice ] I'll explain when I get back. Johnson, don't argue about it, just do it ! Have you got a pen? Right. I want a hundred thousand pounds, whatever that is in lire, direct to the hotel gabrielli by 11:00 tomorrow. Have you got that? Oh... gabrielli. If he's that rich, I don't suppose it matters that he's married. A hundred thousand pounds ! That's what I was gettin'. What? Exactly? That was my fee. [ Maurice indistinct ] Just make sure the cash gets here ! You got his envelope. He got yours. He got the target, you got me. He's done it. He's done the job for you ! You're jokin'. He couldn't do it. Why not? Any fool could do it. Look, i'm not a plumber ! It's a highly-skilled job. Oh, rubbish ! He's got the instructions. All he needs is a bit of nerve, spare time, and wallop... He's got your man... And your money. [ Maurice ] I've done it now and that's how much it costs. You got a hairpin? What? A hairpin. Oh, yes. Yes, bye. Idiot. Well, salute. Stinkin' a hundred thousand for my life ! He picks it up-a here tomorrow, boss. Our signore horton is-a very confident, no? It would be very nice, of course, if we could take his money... As well as his life, huh? We could use that money to pay you when you kill-a the fat pig. Please, Mr. Scarpa, i, I -- I can't shoot anybody. I couldn't do it. No, I know you couldn't. It's okay. No worry. You use a bomb. [ Scarpa ] There it is. Oh, come on. I can't bear it. Miss Caroline Wright. It was a woman ! He killed a woman. The lift's coming. Sleep well. [ Sigh ] Look, Patricia, I'm really sorry about what happened earlier, or what nearly happened. It's okay. All part of the business, I expect. You know, today... I've been stood up by my date, a married man. I've been aimed at by a hired killer, a gun held to my head. I've been held captive against my will... By a strange man in a strange hotel room... And it's been one of the best days of my life. Really? You can go now, if you want. You're not gonna tell anyone, are you? No one to tell. Really, no one ! I'm missing and nobody knows. When I'm not missing, nobody knows. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ TV announcer ] ...And often achieves a bulk of four tons. Yet he's surprisingly agile... Baby hippos. [ TV ] In a mock battle or in the real thing. The power in these ponderous jaws is tremendous. The life I lead is a mundane, sick existence. And lonely? You think you're lonely? You should try being an assassin. Don't meet many people when you're an assassin, not for long anyway. Yes, but what a life ! I bet you've some stories to tell. Who to? Me. I only needed this one. I was gonna make this the last big one, then I can get out of this crap. Buy a flower shop. A flower shop? You? Yeah. Well... That would be a change of direction. Now I've blown it. Get it back. He's done all the dirty work for you. - It's your money, get it back. - What? Steal it? A bit below you, stealing? It's not as if he's going to tell anyone. Nice idea. Easier said than done. Rubbish ! We'll think of something. [ Snoring ] [ Groaning ] Sorry to interrupt, but we're supposed to be watching horton. Yes, sorry. [ Mike ] What's the plan? What? It was your idea. What do we do now, boss? It's easy. We're stealing the money from him, right? Yes. When's the best time to do that then? At the perfect moment. That's what this game's all about... waiting, waiting for the perfect moment. And here it comes. Here-a we are, signore. A hundred thousand pounds. Two hundred and ten million lire. Thank you. [ Bellboy ] Scusi, signore. Telefono. Grazie. Prego. Actually -- what's the matter, Maurice? Could I put this in hotel security for a couple hours? Si, signor orton. Horton. Orton. Horton... Maurice horton. Maurice horton. Yes. Room 2-3-5. Have you got that? Rossi, you see that case? Hmm? Si. You go shopping. Hor-horton. Yes. Please take note. [ Sigh ] Thank you. Thank you. It's identical, boss. Perfect. Perfect ! Uh, what's happening? Are you ready? Can I place this in, um, hotel security, please? Si, signor horton. No, no... orton. Orton. - Orton. - Orton. Room 3-1, uh, naught. Orton. All-a you gotta do is-a get in there and swap-a the tags. We get-a the money and that horton shit, he get-a what he deserve. [ Mumbling ] Note. - Please take note. - Right, thank you. Okay. I'll pick it up later. Thank you very much. You're thanks. [ Indistinct chatter ] So you've never felt the need... For a woman's company? Yes, maybe, but... It's always been a non-starter, what with my occupation. It's a bit of a passion killer, isn't it? What do you do for a living? Me? Oh I shoot people. It's not a kiss on the cheek and "have a nice day," is it? Don't fret. Things'll pick up when you're a florist. So there's never been anything really special? No, not really. Nothing to set the world on fire. [ Scream ] Dear god, fuoco. Non avvicinatevi ! Lontani, lontani ! Lontani, lontani ! Italiano, attenzione. [ Bellboy ] Francese, attention. English, attention ! Americano... Get the fuck out of here ! [ Bellboy ] Santa Madonna. Pericoloso ! Non avvicinatevi. Lontani ! Grazie, grazie, veccio. Tu sei UN genio. [ Rosemary ] What time did she say she'd ring? She didn't say a time. Perhaps she's decided not to. Perhaps she's forgotten. [ Ringing ] Yes. Miss Wright. Mr. Horton? Have you got the money? Yes, I have. Where is it? Here at the hotel. Bring it to the villa. The villa? Are you arguing with me? All right. How soon can you get there? About an hour. See you then, big boy. Right. Arrivederci. Arrivederci to you too. Horton, 2-3-5. Thanks. Thank you. Grazie. Prego. You're holding a case of mine. Melvyn orton, room 3-1-0. [ Melvyn ] You sure this is right? Do we want to settle your account now? What? No, later. Oh. You're-a coming back then? Of course I'm coming back. I'm coming back, aren't I? [ Footsteps ] Orton, 3-1-0. Right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Um, isn't that mine? Not yet. You have to earn it first. Give me. Prego. Per dove? The lido, please. The lido ! Let's go. The lido. Si, subito. The lido. Smile. You're not thinking of using that, are you? We're only doing this so you don't have to use that thing again. Okay, now ! Here. No, no ! What-a you say? Not with her there. What has she done wrong? She's-a marry the little shit. Now press it ! Then just -- just wait 'til they've landed. Oh, Maurice, is this it? It's just -- honestly, Maurice, you shouldn't have done this. Maurice, are you all right? Uh -- it's just -- I don't like carrying so much cash about, that's all. Oh, Maurice, it's just -- it's wonderful ! Maurice, she'll be here soon. If it worries you so much, sit on it. [ Scarpa ] Press it ! Press it ! Press it ! Press it. [ Sigh ] Again. It's not working. It's not working. We must be out of range. Take US in closer. We can't, boss. It's too shallow for this boat. Gotcha ! Ha-ha-ha. No ! It's okay. It's just for show. -Remember, you still in-a range. -What about my money? Don't worry. We take care of for you. Payment on delivery. Oh, unbelievable, Maurice. - Nooo ! Nooo ! - Maurice ! Maurice ! [ Screaming ] Maurice, help me ! Stop ! Stop ! That's mine ! That's mine ! Press it now ! Press it now ! Press it now ! It's not working ! - Ahh, it's mine ! - It's bloody mine ! No it's not. It's mine ! Who are you? Caroline Wright. Caroline Wright ! You're dead ! Dead? Why haven't you killed her? Killed me? Killed her? You did-a put-a the switch on, yes? Yes, I checked it when I swaped the tags. You swapped the tags? I swapped the tags ! Oh my god ! No ! Kill him, boss ! The case ! Get the case! You idiots ! [ Clicking ] - Oh my god ! - It's his. The money's his. Put the gun down. It's okay, stay cool. I've got them covered. It was his job so it's his money. You stole it. Stole it? I beg your pardon. I got this from the bank this morning. It's my money. Not anymore. It's mine. Mr. Horton's bought this villa. I've got the papers to prove it. He came all the way from england to buy it. Butt out, lady ! He came here on medi-date. - Medi what? - Medi-date. Check it out. Look, I got this money from my bank. Here's the receipt. Put the gun down. Oh, come on, partner. We've come this far. Put the bloody gun down ! Sorry about this. Let's just turn around and get out of here. There's been a misunderstanding somewhere. What are you doing? Maurice, what's medi-date? [ Sirens ] Gobbledegook. Mad as a hatter, poor woman. I'll tell you, you weren't bloody worth it. That's okay because neither is the house. One hundred thousand pounds for a villa in venice? I can't go wrong. Uh, nobody's called for me, have they? Si, si. Um, the mister Marshall called. He say, "you're farting around, you dickhead." Dick... head. Yes. I'll, I'll -- "you are a useless... Wa--"? "Waste of space." "Waste of space." He out of Patience. You out of job. Okay. Bravo. What is it about me? What do I do that sends every man packing? I'm not packing because of you. I'm packing to stay alive. The people I work for, they're not nice. They give you a target, you bloody-well kill him. Mess it up, they kill you. If you mess up like I messed up, Christ, they'll never stop lookin'. They'll find me. Actually, I did get to see one. It's not a villa. It's a big house on the grand canal. Umpteen bedrooms... And a nice, cozy cellar. Um, and it's empty right now. I thought you said you weren't going to use that again. That's great coming from you, miss Rambo. It's my fault. Let me talk to them. Talk to them? They're gonna blow me away ! Don't you understand? They're gonna blow you away too. They're not picky, these people. Any minute, they're gonna come through that door. We're gonna end up a bloody mess on the floor ! [ Knocking ] [ Knocking ] Message ! Don't move. "Mr. Lawton, congratulations. "Three birds with one stone. Generous bonus included in payment. Already credited to your European account." The job's done? They paid me? - Santo dio ! - Oh, steady on. Oh yeah, sorry. Thank you very much for all your kindness. If anything else I can do... To make your stay happy, do not hesitate to call on me. [ Marshall ] Why didn't you call me? How much do they want for it? Uh, two hundred and -- no, sorry. Three hundred... And fifty... five... Thousand... pounds. Right. Get to the banco popolare, Saint marks square, take some I.D. The cash'll be there for you. Be able to manage that, will you? If you can do that, you can keep the job. I-- oh, uh -- [ panting ] If I can do that, you can stuff the job ! [ Clerk ] Thank you, sir. Have a nice day. Grazie. Prego. The Bahamas, please, and step on it... the railway station, actually. [ Rosemary ] Isn't that the estate agent girl? Is it? What's she hanging around for... Looking so pleased with herself? You'll have to change your name. Yes, something boring. Miss Smith, how about that? Miss Gladys Smith. How 'bout Mrs. Charlton black? Oh, that sounds far too exciting. Who's charlton black? Me. You don't have to answer straight away. I mean, it can wait. You can think about it. Why wait? This is the perfect moment. The answer is... Yes, charlton. It's Chuck, really. The answer is... Yes, Chuck. [ Airplane engine ] Maurice. Oh dear. It just needs a little bit of work. Santo bischero, credo. Che pasticcio. E quello é -- abbiamo finito la settimana scorsa. Eccolo, eccolo, eccolo !
