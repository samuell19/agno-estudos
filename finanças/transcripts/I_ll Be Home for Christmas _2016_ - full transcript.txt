- Checklist? - Shoot. - Homework? - Check. - Cookies for the bake sale? - Double check. Play date? With Taylor after rehearsal for the Christmas concert. - Time? - 3:15 p.m and 4:30 p.m. Triple and quadruple check. Good luck on your Math test and... I love you. Check. And ditto. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes? I was at the Mexican border and when I heard... I turned around and drove straight through. Better late than never, sweetie. I'm glad you came. - Did they get 'em? The guys who did it. - Yeah. They don't make him like Sully. Not anymore. The best cop this state ever had. You know he would say the same about you. Nah, I was just a local. Best detective this town ever had. Not everybody would agree with that. Yeah. Come on. Let's go. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hello. Hi. You're in my spot. Your spot? I'm sorry, I mean, your car. You're parked in my space. It's reserved for me, pal. It's Mike, and this is visitor parking. I've worked here long enough. I'm pretty sure I know where my reserved parking space is. And I'm pretty sure you may wanna double check. I don't need to double check. Now, please, I'm gonna be late for a meeting and I hate being late. Same here. So, have a nice day. Look, I don't wanna argue with you, and I certainly don't wanna ruin your holidays by calling security, but I will if I have to. So please, move your car now. Well, what if I call security and tell them that there's a crazy person in the parking lot? - I'm crazy? - Kinda. Seriously? Did you even bother to look? Because that's my name right there on the curb. - Really? - Yes. Did you have those pretty eyes of yours checked lately? All right, I've had enough of this. Look. See for yourself, buster. So, just out of curiosity, is visitor your first or last name? Sorry, they're resurfacing the visitor's lot, so they moved you to the north entrance. Facilities sent an email a month ago. A month ago? I don't even remember what I had for breakfast this morning. Yes, I'm sorry, I should've reminded you. Your 9:00 deposition's here. Detective from the Levinson case. Judge wants to put it out before Christmas. Less than a week away, and counting. I'm so sorry to keep you waiting, Detective Kelly. No problem. I was hung up too. I was almost late myself. My apologies. You're my 9:00? Well, more like 9:15, but hey, at least you made it before Christmas. How long you staying? About as long as it takes me to find the nearest freeway on my outlet. I just thought I'd go check on my buddy first. See how he's doing. I heard he was taking it pretty hard. They were partners for a year. There's no other way to take it. So, what? That's it? You're just gonna hit the road? What? It's the retirement Ellie and I always planned on. I just never thought I'd be taking it alone, that's all. Jack, it's been three years. It's Christmas next week. Come on. Stay until at least after New year's. - Lot of good parties. - There's a fishing trip in Cabo, and a marlin with my name on it. No, there's no way I'm gonna miss that. Yeah. OK. I am so far behind today, it's not funny. You behind schedule? Is that even possible? An extremely annoying police detective stole my parking space this morning. Only, apparently, it's not my space anymore. - Was he cute? - Linda, please, I have a boyfriend. So, he was cute. That's not the point. He made me late, right when every judge in town is trying to wrap up every case before we close for the holidays. Like I tell my patients, Christmas is a very stressful time of year. But I'm not one of your patients. I'm your friend. And as your friend who just happens to be a psychologist, I'm telling you to relax. This job's taking up so much of my time, and I want Gracie to have a perfect Christmas. Listen to me. You have nothing to complain about. You're a terrific ADA, you have a great kid, an ex who lives in Paris who gave you full custody of said kid, plus, a fantastic boyfriend who adores you. Someone mention me? Rand, what're you doing here? Is that any way to say hello to your fantastic boyfriend? - I'm sorry. - I'll leave you two love bugs alone. Bye, honey. I thought you had a meeting with your lawyer this morning. - And their office is right there. - I knew that. Sorry, I just have so much to do before the holidays, I guess I'm just distracted. Which could explain why you left your jacket in my car last night. I was wondering where it ran off to, you thief. Well, I have it. I can bring it by your office after I'm done and we could have lunch. I'm crazy busy today. Then I'll just swing it by the house tomorrow night. Did I mention I have a fantastic boyfriend? - What was that? - Some crazy lunatic. - See you later. - OK. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, buddy. Long time, no see, huh? That's the happiest I've seen him since he got here. Yeah, Nose and I go way back. You worked with the canine unit? No, no, Miss Sully and Nose were my go-to buddies. - How bad is he? - Just a strained vessel. Doc says he'll be fine. Could you give us a minute alone together? Yeah, sure. Yeah, I know, buddy. I know. I miss him too. Almost as much as I miss my wife. And it doesn't make it any easier being... around Christmas at home, does it? Feeling sorry for ourselves isn't gonna do either one of us any good. I know. You and I are a couple of tough, old dogs. But we're gonna get through this. Yeah, life goes on, see. For both of us. Has to. Yeah. Yeah, it has to. It's just so great to see my favorite customer, right back where he belongs. I always did my best thinking on this stool. Have you seen Jackie yet? You are staying, right? Well, holidays were never my thing. It was always Ellie's thing. Well, I hear she has a new job, and a new man in her life. - Is it serious? - Who knows. Well, anyway, you've got places to go and fish to catch. How was rehearsal for the Christmas concert? - You don't wanna know. - It couldn't be that bad. Mom, listen to me. I have no musical ability. - You're being too hard on yourself. - No, I'm not. I'm really OK with it. So, you need to be OK with it too. I'm OK with everything. Even with that thing in our driveway? - Stay in the car. - OK. Hello? Hello, anyone home? This is a private residence, you're gonna have to move... Jack. That's "Dad" to you. And you don't look so happy to see me. No I'm just... a little surprised. You haven't been home in three years. Or called, or written. Same old father. I wrote. I wrote twice. I was passing by and I thought I'd stop in. So your last postcard said you were on your way to Mexico. Wait, I get it. Officer Sullivan. Yeah, that's why you're here. Your cop buddy. Yeah, more or less. Say goodbye. I remember you. Well, you should. I'm your Grandpa. Haven't seen you in almost forever. Grandpa left town when grandma went to heaven. I missed you. Gimme a hug. Well, I know you'll are busy and I'll get out of your way. You mean, you're not staying for Christmas? Your grandfather never really liked the holidays. - I did. - That's not very Grandpa-like, is it? So you're kind of like... the Grinch, say. Yeah, I'm the Grinch. Fair enough. I like the Grinch. Grandpa... Grinch... Grandpa Grinch. Maybe you could stay for dinner? Really? Please. Grandpa Grinch. Please stay. Well, I guess I could stay, and then, get a fresh start in the morning. Pick up supplies in town while I'm here. I have to go to the grocery store. Cool. Let's take grandpa's house. No, it's off limit to kids. Really? And why is that? You do realize that's age discrimination, you know. I told you. I'm the Grinch. Let's take the car. Why do we need broccoli? Because it's good for you, unlike these. Oh, my. Now how did those get in there? I'll be at the register. Can you please put these back? Well, I'll get that. Thank you. We still need... Well, if it isn't the incomparable Jack Foster. Mike Kelly. You rookie son of a gun. My surrogate kid. All clean-shaven and rugged as ever. Well, it's Detective Kelly now. - They gave you the promotion, huh? - Thanks to your recommendation. I can't say you didn't deserve it. You heard about, Sully? Yeah, that's why I'm here. I drove in from Juarez. Just got here this morning. I really meant to make it to the memorial, but I got stuck in a deposition. Jack, this new ADA, she is a real piece of work. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh, no. You're not gonna believe this. Well, try me. - She's here. - Yeah? She's coming this way. Are you OK? Yeah, Mike, where'd you go? I want you to meet my daughter, Jackie. - What, this is your daughter? - Yeah. You know him, Father? Yeah, Mike and I used to work together, sort of mentored. - So, you two... - We met. Briefly. Long enough for him to call me crazy. Oh, yeah. That was after you threatened to call security on me. Well, if I'm not wrong, it sounds like you two need a second chance - to get to know each other. - I'll say. Why don't we all get together and have dinner tonight and bury the hatchet? Where, in my back? Funny. Yeah, I don't want to inconvenience you and your husband. Good. Some other time, maybe. Hi, Mike. I'm Gracie. See, it's Christmas and she's actually divorced. So it wouldn't be imposing, right? And it's the nice thing to do. Isn't it, Mom? Fa la la. Fa la la. That was a great dinner, Mommy. So, are you going to decorate for Christmas? Of course, I just haven't gotten around to it yet, but it's on the schedule. There's a decorating schedule? Jack, you have no idea. Believe me, there's a schedule for everything. In fact, I'm going to pick up the tree, right after Gracie's flute lesson tomorrow. Sounds like you used to really deck the halls back when Jackie was a kid. No. No, I worked Christmases, so... He's the Grinch. He decked the bad guys while we slept and waited for Santa. - Right, Grinch? - Yup. Decked the bad guys. That's Mike's job now. - Let me help you with that. - No, I got it. I insist. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Psst. Ha-ha! Kinda hit a nerve about Christmas, didn't I? Don't worry about it. I survived. You did more than survive. You are a force of nature. Yeah, you look like your dad. Seriously, a lot like your dad. Only, prettier. So, So you changed your mind now? You don't think I'm a crazy person? It's about 50-50, but... Let me let you in on a secret. Little crazy can be a good thing. It's really handy sometimes. Anyone want dessert? - What? No. - No. - I'm full. - I'm full. I'm stuffed, like, no way. Well, I better get going, unless you're gonna let me wash the dishes. Really? Rand never washed the dishes. Rand? Who's Rand? Mom's boyfriend. Really? Rand? What kind of a name is Rand? A very nice name. Well, it's kind of a strange name for a guy anyway. - I agree with the Grinch. - Stop it. Rand Edwards is an investment banker from a lovely family. They're very influential people. So you're serious about this Rand character, huh? He's not a character. I'd say that he's a very lucky guy. And I'd say you're a really charmer, you are. Right, Grinch? Real charmer. A looker too. All right, young lady, isn't it time for you to go to bed? Can Grandpa Grinch tuck me in? I don't tuck people in, and don't call me that. Wait a minute, I thought you said you were the Grinch. I mean, don't call me "Grandpa," I need some time to get used to that name. Come on, Jack, there's a first time for everything. Might wanna think about it. Tuck the lady in. Yeah. All right. OK. Go get your BVDs on and... or whatever. My what? The Grinch means pajamas. That's how they used to talk in the olden days. Yes! So, it was lovely meeting you. Again. - Yeah. - Thanks for the kitchen help. You know, something to be said about second chances. Hey, did you know that you have a flat tire on the CJ? Yeah, blew the engine. I think it might've swallowed a valve. I'm taking some time off. If you want, I could swing by, take a look. It's a four cylinder, right? Yeah, but you better make it tomorrow morning. - You're not staying for Christmas? - I got a date with a Marlin in Cabo. - You still fish, right? - It's in my blood. Call of the wild. I'll check on the jeep tomorrow. - OK. Sleep well. - You too. - Hi. - Hey. So, what am I supposed to do? Read you a story? No. We're just gonna talk. I see. OK. - You like to fish? - I've never tried. - They're kinda squishy. - No. Maybe you should learn. Maybe someone should teach me. It's all about patience. They're quite shrewd. You gotta think like a fish. Calculate it's next move. I've done some calculations. I'll bet I'm not gonna like this. I went on line. It's about 1820 miles from our house to Cabo San Lucas. That means, if you drove 303 miles a day, you could get there in six days. - What's your point? - If you stay here for Christmas, and leave the next day, you could still make it to your fishing tournament on time. I'll run the numbers and get back to you. Already did. You'll only get the same numbers. Also, the Grinch stayed for Christmas, you know. - At the end of the book. - What? - That can't be right. - Sure it is. He even carved the roast beast for dinner. So, will you stay? - Maybe. - "Maybe" is not an answer. You gotta do better than that. You want me to sleep, don't you? OK. OK. But just still Christmas. Then I hit the road. - Deal? - Deal. - What? - You drive a hard bargain. My mom is a lawyer. - Just get some sleep, will you? - OK. - Well, hey, look who's still here. - For a few days. - Well, it's a Christmas miracle. - Don't push it. OK. I won't. Can I get you anything else, Officer Foster? I'm retired now, son. You can call me "Jack." Yes, sir. Officer Jack. I'm just kidding. - I'm just kidding. - It's OK. That kid of yours, he's a good one, huh? Yeah, he is. Unfortunately, he's got himself into some pretty hot water though. Luke? No, that can't be true. He was working the Christmas tree lot, behind Fieldings hardware, and a customer said that he went into her purse and stole her wallet. - He swore he didn't do it, but... - There's proof? Yeah, they found the wallet in his backpack. It was empty. Look, I know he's my son, but if Luke said he didn't do it, he didn't do it. Well, I'll see what I can do. I'll look into it. I appreciate that, Jack. Thank you. Hey, he's still here! Why is everybody so surprised? I'm just surprised you're not at the adoption and auction. What is that? They're adopting Mellis out at the police auction? It's standard operating procedure. Now that Sully's gone, they put they guy out to pasture. He can't have two masters, you know. - When is it? - Four p.m. this afternoon in Grandview. That's a bit of a drive. Yeah, I wish I could take him myself, but I can't. There's a couple of nice bass boats in that sale too. Well, he'd make a great pet for some lucky family. Yeah, maybe, but it's really tough to re-teach a mature dog. They can learn, but they can't un-learn. Yeah, I know what you mean. There goes a good example of that. The two years I've known you, you've never talked much about your dad. There isn't much to say. Like every other cop, he's married to his job, so he's not around much. That must've been tough on your mom. If it bothered her, she never let anyone know. They had big plans to buy a motor home, and take off and see the country when he retired. But then she got in the head on. And was gone from us within minutes. But he took off anyway. That must've been devastating. Of course, but... now he's back and he's leaving again. Well, if I didn't know any better, I'd say I'm sensing some childhood abandonment issues. Will you stop being so clinical? Am I wrong? I don't know. There's just so much going on in my life right now. With the holidays, with Rand... Things didn't work out with Gracie's dad and I really wanna get it right this time. The problem is, I never know what's going to happen if and when my father decides to show up. Maybe you just need to let things happen, for a change. Stop trying to plan everything and just... ...breathe. Well, on the bright side, he did volunteer to take Gracie to her lesson and pick up a Christmas tree. I call that progress. I call you an optimist. This trip better be worthwhile. Mom's not going to be happy when she finds out that I missed my flute lesson. She's not gonna mind, come on. I worry that you're in serious denial. - What? - What? My mom had me see a therapist when my dad left. I learned a lot about human behavior. Hey, where's the police adoption? I'm sorry, it's been over for twenty minutes. It's OK, Grinch. There's still time to get the Christmas tree. That's gonna be our excuse to mom. Christmas tree. Is that him over there? Yeah, come on, come on. Hey, buddy. Hey, how are ya? He's taken a shine to you. What's the trick? He's an old friend. What do you want for him? No, Zoey's always wanted a dog. We just got him today. You don't want this dog. Excuse me? Nose is stubborn, he's kinda set in his ways... and he doesn't like to play, it's not gonna be much fun for your daughter. But I'll tell you what, I'll be happy to take him off your hands. Mom, he's just lying there. Is he gonna do that the whole time? - It's so boring. - Do something. Maybe we can make a deal. You adopted a dog? Look, Jackie, he's not just a dog, he's family. - You already have a family. - He needed a home. So you volunteered my home? Well, he can bunk with me out there. But he can visit, right? Because dogs are good for kids and I need that right now. Hey, stop it. Nose. Nose, hey, cut it out. - See, there. - Good boy. My house isn't set up for a dog. Well, maybe it should be. Seeing Sully let him have the run of the house, it was fine. This isn't Sully's house, Father. What is he doing? He's trained to investigate. I don't need to be investigated. I need peace and quiet. I'll go get him a treat. Here, Nosey boy. Come on. Come on. Come on. OK, if a dog is gonna be in my house, there need to be rules. Really? What rules? Lots of rules, Father. Lots of them. Not now! Rand, I didn't know you were coming. Yes, you did. Special delivery. Hey. I'm Jack. Jack Foster. Jackie's dad. Dad? Rand Edwards. Nice to meet you, Randy. It's Rand. Oh, right. Father's just visiting for a few days. Fantastic. Then he can come to the Christmas party. What Christmas party? My family hosts a gala every year, the night before Christmas eve. It's the social event of the season. Father is not a big fan of holiday parties or holiday anythings really. But he has to come. I've been waiting to introduce Jackie to my parents, but now, both sides of the family can get to know each other, huh? Sounds like I ought to be there. Nose just kicked over the trash. Sorry, I'm allergic to dogs. I think he might be allergic to you. Are you OK? I better get an anti histamine. We still good for dinner tomorrow night? Look, I don't want to interfere with your schedule. You kids go have fun, huh? - Right, should we say seven? - À bientôt. - Yeah, same to you, Randy. - It's Rand. - So, that's your Rand, huh? - Yes, it is. - What? - I didn't say anything. - You don't like him. - I didn't say that. You didn't have to say it. What, so he has an opinion now too? How would I know? I bet I know. Listen, you, shouldn't you be practicing for your Christmas concert? I really don't know if I should leave you two alone right now. Flute, now. Holler if you need me. Come on, Nose. Speaking of the flute, how was the lesson today? - Rescheduled. - What? No, you can't just reschedule things. No, it turns out you can. But you at least picked up the Christmas tree? Right? I can do that tomorrow. I'm scheduled to decorate tomorrow. That's why I needed the Christmas tree here, today. Christmas is less than a week away and I am booked every minute up until then. OK, OK. I'll take care of everything. It'll be fine. The holidays are very important to me, get it? - You want me to get that? - No, Rand must've forgotten something. Good Lord, Rand, please take me away from all this. Well, I would, but I don't think your boyfriend would approve. Oh, boy. You're not Rand. I hope that's not too much of a disappointment. No, not at all. And you're here because? I'm here to talk to your dad about the jeep. But you know, I did wanna check to see if somebody had poached your new parking space. I don't see why anyone would want it. It's further away than the north pole. - If you need a ride, you let me know. - Thanks, I'll keep that in mind. Is that Nose? You mean the newest addition to the family, I'm told. Yeah. They say there's no place like home for the holidays, but I beg to differ. Can I give you a piece of advice? - Why not? - Breathe. Just breathe. Nah, we can do better than this, huh? - It's not that I don't like dogs. - Then what's the problem? My father. He has a way of turning everything upside down. - Honey, you need a break. - I wish I had time for a break. Like, away from work, anything. Well, I'm volunteering at the old River Falls firehouse after work. The community center on Grand? They serve dinner to the homeless on Christmas eve. And they're looking for volunteers to set up. - What can I get you? - Hi. Two. Well, I have dinner with Rand tonight. Then there's Gracie's Christmas concert, and then there's the big party at Rand's parents the next night, - and then it's Christmas eve and... - Hold it, girl. One day at a time. Besides, it's just for an hour. Thank you. You'll see. It'll do you good. And when am I supposed to decorate the house? Today, when Rand picks me up? - I thought your dad was helping out. - Thanks. Well, he is, but... Thank you. Done deal then. We'll walk over together. - OK. - OK. Thank you. Hi. I love it! All right. Did you used to do this when my mom was a little girl? Well, I kept kinda busy. I bet you're sorry now, aren't ya? All the fun you missed. Yeah. You know, if my mom were here, she'd say the first thing we need to do, is get organized. Your mom is not here. Good point. Here's another one. Here. Try those on. Let's do this. Easy. Oh, God. I wish that they made eggnog ice cream all year long. Yeah, but then it wouldn't be so special, would it? So, I get the feeling that you and my mom still have some ongoing issues to resolve. - You do, do you? - Well, yeah. I wasn't born yesterday. I think she's still mad that you weren't around when she was a kid growing up. Just a feeling. You understand. Yeah, but she already told you. I had work to do. Even on Christmas day? Don't get me wrong. I'm fine with it. You're here now. Yeah. Well, somebody had to be on police duty. A lot of weird stuff happens around Christmas. That someone didn't have to be you, Grinch. Well, Christmas is a... hard time of year for some people. It's kind hard to explain. It's not. I get it. Everything has to be perfect. - Well... - Everyone has to be happy. If you wanna know the truth, makes me wanna run away sometimes. You and me both, kid. You don't have to be perfect. Not for me. And not for my mom either. I like you kinda grinchy. Makes life interesting. That's good to hear. Hey, let's finish these and get another one. You call yourself a Grinch. I see right through you. You do? - Well... - Want the rest of that? Oh Nosey, he loves ice cream. The warehouse itself was shut down 40 years ago, and every since then, the building's been used as a shelter. They don't build 'em like this anymore. It's like a living antique. Yeah, but the planning commission denied out petition for landmark status, and without it, the city can just sell the place off. In fact, there's a buyer waiting already. Then they will tear it down. - Can't you appeal? - Oh, honey, we did. We should hear something in a couple of days, but I don't know. So this might be your last Christmas dinner here? Darling, I don't wanna talk about last Christmases. - Hey, where do you want me to put this? - Right here, sweetheart. - Wait, can I help you? - No, I got it. I got it. Oh, my goodness. Jackie Foster. - Suzie. - Yeah. I haven't seen you since I left for college. I heard about your new job with the DA. Congratulations. That's just great. - Thank you. - Hold on. You're Jack Foster's daughter? - You know my father? - Know him? Only for 40 years. He spent so much time here, people started to think he was one of the homeless. We have sure missed him since he up and left. I've missed him. Well, he's back here for Christmas, for a few days. Here? Now? Then you tell him to get his butt down here tomorrow. We need all the help we can get over the next three days, if this place is gonna be ready by Christmas eve. You tell him Adele said so. - That's an order. - OK, I will. If I can move a couple of things around, I might be here too. Really? Then count me in too. The more the merrier, my darlings. Here she comes. Hey. Mommy, take my hand, take my hand. Come on, close your eyes. Close your eyes. - OK. - Now, come on. Keep your eyes closed. Come on. You're gonna love this. Open 'em. Wow! There's an even bigger "wow" inside. Wow. Come on, mom. - Oh, wow. - Ta da! - Where are all my decorations? - They're here. We just added a couple of extras to kinda jazz up the place. - A few. - Wait till you see the bathroom. The toilet plays "Jingle Bells". I'll get it. When did you do all this? Hey, Mike. Come on in. Ho ho ho. - This is really something. - It sure is. I brought the file that you asked for. Had to pull a few strings to get it. - What file? - Nothing. - Do you have to go to the bathroom, Mike? - Gracie. - No, why? - Wait till you hear our toilet. It's wild. Let me know. - Don't you have homework to do? - Done. And I already practiced my flute. Let's do something fun. OK. Maybe see a movie? Something Christmas-y? "It's a wonderful life" is playing downtown. - Can Mike come with us? - If he wants. Hey, are you going? No, I wish. Rand and I are going to dinner. Tell him you've come down with something. Like the plague. Yeah, like the plague. My relationship with Rand is based on trust. I don't lie. Then just tell him that you'd rather go to the movie with us. Unless you'd rather not. Well? No, I would love to go with you. With all of you. Won't be the same without you. I have to get ready. So, maybe next time. Reindeer Zombies is playing at the mall. In 3D. - OK. - Let's go. Have you made your decision? We'll have the Brunello Riserva, but nothing after 2009. And then we'll start with the "stracciatella", followed by the "pezzeti Di cavalo". Very good, sir. You really don't have to order for me. That's how it's done in the Edwards family. So, you didn't tell me that your father was coming for Christmas. I didn't know. Turns out there's lots about him that I didn't know. Really? Anything interesting? I met a woman at a homeless shelter today who said he used to volunteer there all the time. Why in the world would you go to a homeless shelter? I'm helping set up for Christmas eve. I'm actually going back tomorrow. Feels so good to do something that makes a difference. I've got a great idea. Why don't you come with me? What? Well... If I say yes, can we talk about something else? Like what? Your wine, sir. Jenkins and Herschel has an opening. The blue chip law firm in the city? Dad's and my company pretty much put them on the map. Now they owe us some favors and I wanted to cash one in. For you. That would be amazing. It's just... I really like working at the DA's office. At least for now. Opportunities like this don't come along everyday. - I know. - I'm just thinking about your future. Our future. Together. - To us. - To us. One. Two. Three. Just think about it, OK? Jenkins and Hershel could really use somebody with your talent. That's sweet of you to say. No, no. - I'm so sorry. - Everything all right out here? Yes, just swell. - I should go. - I'm... OK. Merry Christmas, Randy. It's Rand. - Did you have a good time? - A great time. My house looks like Disneyland. I have a snow globe on my front lawn, and my toilet plays jingle bells. It's like I'm living in some kind of Christmas nightmare. My life is under fire from every direction. Who cares? You're not gonna be living there soon. Rand Edwards is talking about your future together. Sounds like you're about to live happily ever after. I know. Sounds like it. Why can't you just be happy for yourself? I don't know. It's just the little things, really. Like Rand always orders dinner for me, he wants to change jobs. Now. It's confusing. It sounds like he cares about you. He wants the best for you. Plus, it's perfectly natural to have second thoughts. It is. Maybe. You want to know the truth? I almost canceled on him last night to go to the movies with Gracie and my father. And Mike. Whoa. Rewind. - Who's Mike? - The guy who stole my parking space. And Mike invited you to the movies? Well, it turns out he knows my father. I thought he was gonna be a jerk at first, but there's something really sweet about him. He even offered to do the dishes. And that makes him what, Prince Charming? I'm telling you, Chief, you got a pickpocket working main street and you've charged the wrong person. Do your fishing in Cabo, Foster. That case was open, and now it's shut. The wallet was found in the kid's backpack. Luke Tate didn't steal anything. Then who did? Willy Kelso, right there in the Santa suit. Right next to the Christmas tree lot, where Luke was working. Kelso had access and he's got a long record. Kelso? He's in the PEN. - You're all wet again, Foster. - Excuse me. Sir, Kelso actually got out a month ago. Detective Foster had me run a check. Ramirez, Detective Foster doesn't work here anymore. Don't come in here and use my people. I took these myself. Broadway and 4th, about an hour ago. Oh, yeah? Looks like he's doing community service. And I'm the sugar plum fairy? All you got is a theory and some nice pics of Santa. And all you got is the wrong person, and you know I'm right. Jack. Go fish. Just beat it. Just like old times. Nothing much has changed. You're telling me. Yup. - Once a cop, always a cop. - Yup. Bill Jenkins on line one. He says, Rand Edwards told him to call. - Wanna take it? - Sure. Could you close the door? Hi, Bill. Yes, Rand mentioned you might have an opening. What do you think, Mr. Foster? Am I gonna spend New Year's in jail? Not if I can help it, son. I know that look, you have a lead. - Maybe. - I can't thank you enough, Jack. I haven't done anything yet. I forgot to tell you, I saw Jackie at the old firehouse. Yeah? What was she doing at the firehouse? Volunteering, just like her dad did. I guess, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I got a flute lesson to go to. - All right, so go. I'll see you later. - Yes, you will. Jack... Ellie would be so proud. So am I. Well, you're a hard worker. Yeah, guess who I've learned it from. I had the afternoon off, so I figured I'd finish this up for your pops. - Where is he? - He's at a flute lesson. There's a Christmas concert coming up. - Tomorrow night, right? - Right. He didn't take Nose with him? No, Jack thought that it might be a little bit hard on his ears. Well, it's nice of you to fix the jeep. Yeah, the least I can do. And I owe him one, your dad's taught me so much. - Old man's a pretty great guy. - Yeah? - I wish I knew him as well as you do. - Yeah, that's life of a cop. It's tough with family sometimes. Yeah, that's for sure. When I was seven, I really wanted a doll house for Christmas. So he promised to get me one, but he forgot. So he promised to get it the next year... and he forgot again, and again. It kind of became a family tradition, no doll house, no father. So you got lumps of coal in your stocking? No, I mean... He tried, I guess. One year it was Royal pears. Tasty though. Another year it was a bathroom rug. Big thick one. Well, sometimes the best gifts aren't the ones under the tree. Well, what's this... - He wants to play. - Play? - What, with me? - With you. You do remember what it's like, don't ya? Of course I do. I just don't know... Let's just do it. Come on, he's ready to go. OK. Let me go change real quick. Right. Let's go. Yeah. Go get it, go get it, bud. You OK? Just my pride, wounded. Frosty there is a lot worse off than you are. God, I'm a mess. That's impossible. You don't have to be so nice. I forgive you for what happened in the parking lot. You forgive me? OK. OK, well, hold on... Game on. - This feels better. - That's pretty adorable... for a lawyer that is. No one's ever called me adorable before. Not that I can remember. Not even your... your guy... Rand? - He doesn't think of me that way. - What is he, blind? Anyway, I made some hot chocolate. Hope you don't mind. No, after a wet snow ball fight, it's perfect. Let's sit. Sure. So, is there someone that thinks you're adorable? No. No. No one special. Not for a while now. It'd be nice though. Does that mean you're spending Christmas with your parents? I wish... I lost my folks, I grew up in a foster home. Actually, Jack is the closest thing I had to a father figure growing up. Pretty lucky to have your dad here. - Hi, guys. - How was the lesson? You're not going to like my answer. Honey, at least it's over. We'll fill you in later. I better get going. We're supposed to be at the firehouse by 7:00. Come on, Nosey. I think we tired him out. We were playing Frisbee in the yard. Well then, I guess we better let him rest. Let's go. You OK, Mommy? You need a hand with that? I keep hitting my thumb. Dumb. Here. Let me show you a little trick. OK. Look. You need to set the nail first, and then you just tap it... so you don't have to hold it anymore, then you let go. Right. Then you just knock it in the rest of the way. No bruised fingers, see? Magic. No kidding. Hope I'm not interrupting. Rand. No, not at all. This is Mike, he used to work with my father. Pleasure. Can I talk to Jackie alone? - Mike, can you help me wrap the presents? - Sure. Hey. You too seem pretty cozy. - Are you jealous? - Of him? Are you kidding? I'm glad you're here. You can help me hang the garlands. Yeah, sure, we can do that. Bill Jenkins said that you guys had a great conversation, he's really impressed. Yeah, I still don't know... Yeah, I should take this. Start without me. John, how're you doing? - Of course. No problem. - What'd they say? Good. Good. OK. This is awesome. - You made this happen? - Couldn't do it without you all, baby doll. Too bad this is the last time we're gonna be doing this. Adele, don't say that. Yeah, don't say that. - What happened to the appeal? - Denied. Today. Chairman of the planning commission, Olden... somebody... Yeah, Bill Olden. Called me this afternoon with the good news. - There has to be something you can do. - It's too late. The city is selling the land to a company from out of State, Midland Development. Now, come on, no long faces. If this is our last Christmas here, we are going to make it the best Christmas ever. I'm telling you, it's not the last Christmas here. Please don't give up. Sweetie. OK. How about we all sing some carols before we go? - OK. - Yeah. Gracie's right. Mike, get Alicia to run a check on Midland Development, see what she comes up with. You got it. Hey, everybody. And, go. - No. - No. No! I'll clean it up. Don't be mad, Mom. He's just having fun. You having fun, Nosey? It's way past your bedtime, young lady. Go. OK. I knew this was a bad idea. I just knew it. Isn't that dog supposed to trained not to do things like this? It's hard when they have a new master. It takes time for them to get used to new rules. - Just put him in your motor-home thing. - But, I... Father, get him out of my living room now. Come on, pal. Come on. I'm not ready to go to sleep yet. Come on, Gracie. It's a school night. Lights out, girl. I don't want you to be upset with grandpa. I'm not upset with him, I'm upset with what happened. It wasn't his fault. Nose is his responsibility. When I get mad at people, you tell me it's important to forgive. So... Maybe it's time for you and grandpa to do that. Forgiveness is good for you, mama. - You hear me? - It's not as easy as it sounds. Being a good daughter is never easy. Just ask me. - That so? - That so so. Parents are a lot of work, but in the end, I'd say they're worth it. - Well, I'm glad to hear it. - We all make mistakes, Mom. We always will. I guess we do. - Good night, Mommy. - Good night. - I love you. - I love you too. I'm almost done. - Jack. - It's Dad. Name's Dad. What I'm trying to say, father dear... is that I know that I got overly upset and I'm sorry. Well, I'm the one that needs to apologize. No, you don't. The truth is, I miss my mom. Especially this time of year, and... I know that you left because it got too hard for you to be here, but it was hard for me too. Don't you know that? Well, I'm here now if you still want me to stay for Christmas. Of course I do. Maybe you wanna go get Nose and bring him back to say "good night" to Gracie. You mean that? Someone very wise reminded me that we all make mistakes. Now was that so hard? Come here. Nose? Nose? Here, son. Nose? Nose? Where is Nose? I'm not sure. - He got out of the motor-home. - How? I guess he knows how to work the handle. I think it's too cold for Nose to stay out there for very long. - Let's all go find him. - I'm sure he'll show up. Now how do you know that? What if he doesn't? Foster. Hi, Suzie. Is that right? I'll be right there. I'll be right back. Yeah. I should have known you'd be here. What do you think of that? No, they're not that good, are they? Yeah, the thing is... This around-the-way stuff doesn't really solve anything and it won't bring Sully back either. Famous Bob's. They're good. Yeah, I know it's tough, but what you did was wrong and you know it. So you just gotta own up to it and move on. You and I are... We are out of here in a couple of days. No more rules, just fun in the Cabo San, huh? You're right. There is no comparison. Cookies are better. Yeah. That's pretty, son. So, let's go do what we got to do. Nosey boy. I'm so glad you're OK. Yeah, he just needed some time to think things over. Right, pal? Yeah, what he wants to say is that he is truly sorry for what he did and if you're willing to let bygones be something in the past, well, so is he. Does he promise to try and behave himself? Oh, my gosh! He said that to make it up to you, he and grandpa Grinch are going to cook us dinner before the Christmas concert in the motor-home. - Wait a minute, that's not what he said. - Yes, it is. That's what he said to me. He says he's a good cook too. And you've had three years experience on the road. You never know, we might hurt his feelings if we turn him down. Hoisted by my own best buddy, huh? OK, fine, fine. It's a date. I didn't see much of Rand at the firehouse last night. He's got a lot on his plate right now. It's funny. When we started dating, he was always there. He was so attentive. Here come those second thoughts again. I know. I shouldn't be so hard on him. He works like a dog, he's incredibly successful, comes from a lovely family that I'm finally going to meet, which reminds me, I need a hostess gift for his parents' party and I have absolutely no time to shop. There's a boutique right down the street. They have all kinds of Christmas stuff. - I really should get back to work. - Come on. What's five minutes? OK. Next time you volunteer to make dinner, you might wanna learn how to cook first. That's very funny. I didn't exactly volunteer. OK, what else are you gonna serve beside the lasagna? I'm supposed to serve something else? Jack, really? All right, just let me see what I have. - Oh, my gosh. - I know. How about this? What do you think? Not too much, not too little. It's perfect. It's nice. - Thank you. - Oh, my God. Smell that. Look! I always wanted one of these. I thought you had to get back to work. What's five minutes? Look at the dresser... it's hand painted. Gosh, I have a whole cellar. So you need to put this in for one hour at 350 degrees and don't forget to preheat the oven. I'm not gonna forget to preheat the oven. Don't get grouchy with me, mister. And that goes for you too. And wait, then the rolls go in for the last ten minutes. And I put some Christmas cookies in there that I baked this morning. - Kelso! - Jack! - Slow down! - Whoa! Hey! Hey, sweetie. No. Of course. Yes. I understand. I love you too. Trouble in paradise? Rand can't make Gracie's concert tonight. It's business emergency. It happens. Nose? Can you hold this? Whoa. Ho ho ho. Merry Christmas, Willie. Looks like you get a free dinner tonight. Officers. Good boy, Nose. - They have been in there a while. - Yeah, well, these things take time. - Anything? - He wasn't gonna cooperate at first. But you convinced him? We found a stolen driver's license in his pocket belonging to the woman whose wallet was found in your son's backpack. Great. I told him the DA would go easy if he confessed to planting the wallet. This means you're gonna drop the charges against Luke? - First thing in the morning. - Thank you. Thank you, all of you. It wasn't us. Nose made the call over there. Well, I guess you can't keep a good cop down, right? No, you can't. This is the best lasagna in the world. Yes, Nose will have to give me the recipe. No, he won't. No, it's a trade secret. Is there a dessert? - What? - Is there any dessert? Of course there's dessert. Garçon. See. Christmas cookies! Yeah, specialty of the house, huh? Merci, Garçon. Merci. I almost forgot. These are for you and Nose. To celebrate Christmas. - But it's not Christmas yet. - It's close enough. It's the season. Call me traditional. I made them at school. They're elf hats. Elf hat? I never got an elf hat before. You, Nose? Who is that? You ready? Ready? For what? Jack, you cracked the case. You know the drill. All your gang's waiting at Suzie's to celebrate. - Now? - Yeah, now. I left a message on your cell. You should go, grandpa. You don't have to come to my concert. Look, Alicia, tell the gang another time. Sorry... Hey, Grinch, there won't be another time. You're leaving after Christmas. I want you to be with your friends. Look at me. I really mean it. Right, Mom? Come on, man, let's go. Dinner's on you. Excuse me, is that seat taken? Not anymore. So we'll get the kid an apple juice. Three cheers for the innocent man. Yeah. And to the man of the hour. And to man's best friend. All right, all right, Jack. What's it gonna be? Poker, some bowling, sleigh ride? Yeah, you name it, Grinch. Anything. How about little live music? Surprise! They're beautiful. And they're almost as big as the float in the Rose Parade. I just wanted to say I'm sorry for missing Gracie's concert. - You didn't have to do this. - Of course I did. I know how important these little things are to you. They're not so little, Rand. Of course not. Come here. My parents can't wait to meet you. Mother especially. I'm so excited about tonight, I still haven't decided what to wear. I'm sure you'll find something tasteful. Aren't I usually tasteful? Yes. All I meant is that there's gonna be a lot of very important people there and I just want you to make a good first impression. Not helping. Everything's gonna be fine. All right. You lined up a babysitter, right? A babysitter? Gracie's not invited? - It isn't a children's party. - But it's a Christmas party. Darling, you have a lot to learn about how things work in the Edwards family. I guess I do. Your dad knows that there's a dress code, right? No homeless outfits. I'm sure he'll be presentable. Sure, he will. Love you. How about this? You are not serious, are you? Well, it's Christmas and the snowflakes all light up, see? Who asked you? I trust him on this one. OK. You pick. Finally... The dawn of reason. Try this one. Catch. Gracie, the sitter is here for your sleepover. Afraid I'm not the sitter. - When are you gonna get this right? - Not even remotely. You're Mike. And you look phenomenal... - by the way. - You don't have to say that. No, I don't, but the fact is that you look phenomenal... that is. - If you're here for my father, he is... - Actually, I'm not. I thought I'd swing by and see if you wanted to grab some pizza. - Or a friendly game of Frisbee. - Frisbee? At night? Yeah. I've got a glow-in-the-dark Frisbee. But you look like you have big plans. Yeah, I'm meeting Rand's parents tonight. That's... I mean, that qualifies as big. It is. Jack's coming with me too. - That's really big. - Yeah. - I have to finish getting ready. - You look ready to me. I wouldn't change a thing. - Have fun tonight. - OK. You look nice. Thanks. I had help from two experts. Actually, clothing salons. - No. - Sounds like your alternator's shot. Battery is gone for sure. No, this can't be happening. Not tonight. - Calm down. We'll take mine. - The motor-home? Yeah, I just filled it up. We can't take a motor-home to the Edward's Christmas gala. OK. You got a better idea? Jeep's out already. What about Nose? You won't even know he's there. He'll just stay in the back. - OK. - OK. Try not to scratch it. Close the door tight. There's a dog inside, but it doesn't bite. Or at least he's discerning, when he does. What a house. Like a hotel. A couple lives here? Maybe you wanna keep your comments to yourself tonight. - What did I say? - "A couple lives here?" Used to play a lot of floor hockey in this room. Jackie, these are my parents. Candice and Blair. - Hi. - Hey. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. This is for you. How quaint of you. Andrew? Thank you. And this is Jackie's father. Jack Foster. - How do you do? - Hey. Jackie and Jack. Pair of Jacks. I guess you could say that. We never thought much about it. So what kind of a name is Blair? Family name. Figures. Can we please not do this? Aren't you refreshing. Well, why don't we get the two of you a drink? This way. Tell me, dear, what is it that you do? I work in the city attorney's office as the assistant DA. But she'll be moving over to Jenkins and Herschel after holidays. I still have to think about that, Rand. What's there to think about? J&H is one of the best firms in the country. I guess I kind of like being a crusader for law and order. Call me an idealist. There's nothing ideal about being a civil servant. Sure there is. I was a cop for 40 years. Hors d'oeuvre anyone? I've always loved a man in uniform. I think I'll get a refill. Here you are. You've got some cards from some pretty impressive people here. Governor, two state senators... Honey, it's all about who you know. William Olden, name sounds familiar. He's my brother. He couldn't make it tonight. Olden, isn't he on the city planning commission? Who's on the city planning commission? You must be talking about my Uncle William. Rand, is Bill Olden really your uncle? Did you talk to him about the firehouse? I didn't want to tell you, but that's why I missed Gracie's concert. I'm sorry, but Uncle Will's more concerned about city profit than preserving it's history. This city needs money. Money, money, money. Nose. Get here. Get over here! I'd say this is the best party we've had in years. Look, I told you I'm sorry. I know you did. But ever since you got here... What? Well, if you got something to say, say it. OK. I will, father. I will say it all. You were never there for me when I was a kid. Right? And then when mom died, you just... disappeared, yes? So, OK. I find my way, by myself. Without a father, without a husband. I put all these things together. A life for me and Gracie. A future with a man who cares about me, who's there for me. Who's always pacing on his stupid cell phone. I'm trying to make things work with Rand. Well, maybe you shouldn't try so hard. See, there you go. Nothing I do is ever right or good enough for you. - That's not what I meant. - Yes, it is. You come back here, you and that dog, and you mess everything up you mess up my house, you mess up my schedule. And now, you embarrass me in front of my man and his family. It's like you're trying to sabotage my life. Really? - That's what you think? - What am I supposed to think? And the worst part about it all, is it's Christmas. When everything should be perfect and happy. But is it, father? Is it? I never want to make you unhappy. I gotta go. What's going on? Nose and I are pulling upstate. We're getting out of here as soon as I'm done. - It's Christmas Eve. - Yeah. - Does Jackie know? - No. Not yet. I left her a note. What do you got there? You asked me to have Alicia run check on Midland Developments... - You're not gonna believe what I found. - Yeah? Try me. Well, it is true that it's United State Corporation, but once you get past the shelves, this parent company funded by three investment companies and one of them is local. Edwards banking group. So Rand and his dad are both owners in the company that's tearing down the firehouse. - It's all in there. - And guess what? There's more. His uncle's on the planning commission. - That's conflict of interest. - You bet it is. - Has he mentioned any of this to Jackie? - No. No, just the opposite. In fact, he lied to her about it. - What are you doing? - It's the right thing, Mike. You're not gonna tell her about it? It's not my place. She thinks I'm out to sabotage her life. But, Jack, she needs to know. Then you tell her. Just wait till I'm gone. I gotta get some things in town. Man, I shouldn't have fixed the jeep. Yeah. Thanks for that. It's been good seeing you, Mike. Come on, Jack. Don't do this. You need Jackie as much as she needs you. Take care of my little girl, will you? She respects you... a lot. Did you send the flowers to Candice Edwards? They went out an hour ago. Great. - With my apologies? - Yes, Miss Foster. OK. Thank you. Great. Haven't you done enough? Thanks for your help. Edwards banking owns Midland? Nose, where's the rest of this? Help me find it. There's still a bit of paperwork to be handled but you should be able to break ground in a month. You and I need to talk. I'm in the middle of a phone call. Not anymore. - What's going on? - I'll tell you what's going on. You're gonna call your uncle and have him resign from the planning commission. And why would I do that? Because you forgot to tell me that Edwards Banking Group own the development company that's buying the firehouse. That's a direct conflict of interest, not to mention, unethical and illegal. And I'll make it my personal mission of pressing criminal charges and embarrassing you and your family. Didn't you do enough of that last night? - You lied to me. - You're just upset after what happened. But I already told you that I don't blame you. It's your father's fault. My father is a lot of things, but he's not a liar and a cheat. You, my friend, have till the end of business today to make that phone call. Fine, if it makes you happy. This is all just a big misunderstanding. - I'd really like to believe that. - Believe it. It's done. Thank you. So, we're OK? No, Rand, we're not OK. - I just said I'll fix it. - Like you wanna fix me? And why would you say something like that? You order for me at restaurants, you tell me how to dress. You decide that I'm changing jobs, without my opinion? I'm just smoothing out some of your rough edges, which you know you have. Maybe I like those rough edges. And maybe I wanna be with someone who likes them too. You know this means you won't be getting the offer from Jenkins and Herschel? I'm crushed. You gave that folder to my father and he just threw it out? He said, he didn't want you to think he was sabotaging anymore of your life. OK. I guess I deserve that. Look, I know he plays the tough guy, but underneath it, he loves you more than you could possible imagine. He's lost without your mom, without his job. And the truth is, that no matter what's happened in the past, right now, he needs you to love him back. We had a big fight last night. After the party at Rand's house. Right, the party. How was it? Let's just say, I won't be invited back anytime soon. It's over with Rand? So over. - I'm sorry. - I'm not. Me neither. I mean, you know... I should really work things out with my father. - You better hurry if you wanna catch him. - Catch him? He's not leaving until the day after tomorrow. No, he was packing up this morning. What? I think he's got his cell off. Jackie, don't worry. We'll find him. Let's go. - Come on. - OK. Next stop, Cabo San Lucas. Yeah, I know it's Christmas, but I think we wore out our welcome. Don't go start getting sentimental on me now. Not now. - What's going on? - You're not getting off this easy. - But you said... - Forget what I said. I only have one father, Jack, And it's only Christmas once a year. We should be together as a family. You, me, and Gracie... and Nose. - I just want you to be happy. - Well, then... park that catastrophe of yours right where it is, and... stay with us for a big messy, happy family Christmas. In exchange, I'll never call you Jack again. Please, daddy. Make way, ladies. Incoming. You have really outdone yourself this year, Adele. And from what I just heard, it turns out it's not going to be the last. Really? Tell us. I heard there was an emergency session of the planning commission this afternoon and cranky old Bill Olden has resigned. They voted to give the firehouse historic landmark status. Yep. We are officially a historic landmark. And I suppose you had nothing to do with this. Call it one of them Christmas miracles. I don't see Rand anywhere. Good eye, girl. You don't and you won't. But I do see that very cute police detective. The one who steals parking places. We forgot to put the star on top of the tree. I'll do it. - You want some help with that? - No, I got it. - I'm so sorry. - I'm not. - You can put me down now. - Do I have to? Mom, Mom, Santa's been here. - Are you sure? - See. Cool. - Can we open presents now? - As soon as grandpa gets up. He's so grinchy. I know. Mommy, the jeep's gone. That's strange. There he is. Grandpa, where were you? I got so scared that you left again. No, sweetheart. Mike and I just had a little last minute shopping to do. Presents. Hi, Mike. Come in. You like presents? - Can you put them under the tree? - Sure. Yeah? OK. - I'll make some coffee. - OK, don't be too long. OK. Let's see what we got here. This one's for you, sweet girl. Royal pears. You're kidding. I love Royal pears. They're so good. And here's what we got for you, girl. A bath mat. I needed one of these. One of those big thick ones is a real toe warmer, huh? Why don't we get some presents for Grandpa Grinch... No, wait, wait, wait. There's more. You remembered. Hey, do I ever forget? This is so cute. Look inside. It's just perfect. Thank you, Daddy. I bet that grandpa isn't going to Mexico after Christmas. Gosh, there is a lot of great fishing around here. Bass, trout, big large mouth... Tons of 'em. You know, Nose, the girls might be right. We might be around here for a while. Teach these two how to camp. That would be the best Christmas present ever. Thank you, Daddy. All of these actually close... Little brush. This will go here. It's like I'm home, Ellie. Merry Christmas, honey.
