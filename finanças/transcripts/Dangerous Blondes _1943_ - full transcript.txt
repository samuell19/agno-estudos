Good evening, Mrs Craig. Let me help you with that. - Oh, I can make it. My pleasure, Mrs Craig. You are welcome. Glad to be of any assistance. Oh, apples. Oh yes. Good. You know the old saying: An apple a day keeps the doctor away. What do you use to keep policemen away? [ Radio music ] Eight points. "Ladies and gentlemen. This is station WNAC." "When you hear the gong .." "The time will be exactly ten seconds to seven o'clock." "The Battle of Brains is on the air. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen." "This is Don Wilson." "Tonight, Tom Taylor Cigars bring you that popular quiz contest." "The Battle of Brains." As you know, each week we try to get you the most interesting and capable teams. To compete in this spontaneous and unrehearsed contest. This evening, all the questions I ask will be regarding crimes and criminals. And I am extremely proud to announce .. A real battle is in the offing. For our contestants will be famous city police detectives .. Versus celebrated detective fiction writers. First, allow me to introduce the captains of the respective teams. For the detectives. Inspector Joseph Clinton. And for the detective fiction writers .. Mr Barry Craig. What a ham. Incidentally, Mr Craig has quite a reputation as an amateur detective. And by the way, Mr Craig. You know Inspector Clinton, don't you? Yes. On several occasions when I've been engaged in a little amateur sleuthing .. I've bumped into the inspector. Then you are old rivals, eh? Quite the contrary. On the several occasions Mr Craig has bumped into me as he so aptly puts it .. I have found him to be an exceptional and capable detective .. Fiction writer. Are the judges ready? Alright, Inspector. It is your first question. What is a panopticon? What is a panopticon? A panopticon is a circular prison .. In which the cells and their occupants are visible from a central tower. Correct, Inspector. Now Mr Craig. Your first question. What prison has an Indian name meaning 'Stony Place'? Would you mind repeating that question please? "What prison has an Indian name meaning 'Stony Place'?" Sing Sing. Sing Sing. Sing Sing, you dope. "No coaching please." Sing Sing. "Sing Sing." "Correct." I don't know what you'd do without me. Now, detective Gatling. Here is your question. Mr Gatling, who invented the machine gun? Who invented the machine gun? Why, that was .. Who invented the machine gun? I know that as well as I know my own name. That .. Would you mind repeating the question please? Who invented the machine gun? Mr Gatling. I know who that is as well as I know my own name. Who invented the machine gun? - Yes, Mr Gatling. Who invented the machine gun? Why, that was .. Sorry, detective Gatling. Time is up. That eliminates you. Who invented the machine gun? I know that as well as I know my own name. What is your own name? Gatling. That is right, Mr Gatling. The machine gun was invented by another Gatling. But you are too late. "Now, our next contestant." "Author of a hundred mystery novels, Rufus Scott, needs no introduction." Jane. - Julie. You nearly scared me out of my skin. - Where is Barry? What's the matter, darling? - I must see Barry now. Where is he? He is on the radio. It's a quiz contest. - When will he be home? When the program is over. What is the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost. - Where is the matte? Someone was going to commit murder in the darkroom. Chloroform. He flashed a light in my face. - Wait a minute. Sit down and get your breath. You are a little hysterical. I'll get you some sherry. I don't want any sherry. I suppose it will take Barry ages to get home? Forget Barry for a minute. Take it easy. Here. It's good for what ails you. Now look. Will you stop the double talk and speak slowly .. And tell me what happened. Nothing has happened yet. That is, nothing serious. But there's going to be a murder unless we stop it. Who is going to murder who? - I don't know, Jane. I don't know. But whoever was with me in that darkroom this afternoon was there to kill. He had a handkerchief in his hand reeking of chloroform. And then he put a flashlight in my face and I screamed. And then all of a sudden I heard the door to the darkroom open and close. Evidently whoever was there was after someone else .. Because when he put the light in my face, I .. Now wait a minute. Come on over and sit down. Try to relax. Sorry to prattle on like an idiot. But you are excited, sure. Look Julie. You talk about all this happening in a dark room. What do you mean 'dark room'? I am sorry. I thought you knew. For the past 3 months I've been working for the McCormick Photography Studio. Oh, I see. And by 'dark room' you mean a developing room. That is right. - Have you quit the theater? I'm afraid the theater quit me. So, I took a job posing for the McCormick studio. I sort-of worked myself in until I am now chief cook and bottle washer. I see. Now that we've got all that clear suppose you start at the beginning. Well, Mack .. That is Mr McCormick, has been having rather a rough time of it lately. As a matter of fact. Kirk Fenley, the photographer, and didn't even get paid last week. And then came our big break. Yesterday, the Cottrell Silver Company said they would give us a terrific deal. If we could get Mrs Isabel Fleming to endorse their product. You mean the Isabel Fleming? - Yes. The wealthy society lady? Yes. How can you hope to get a snooty old gal like her to pose for an advertisement? Well, her niece Erika McCormick is the boss's wife. Oh. Did you swing the deal? We took the photograph an hour ago. Everything went like clockwork. And it was after that that I went into the dark room. And then is when it happened. I thought, first I'd tell Mack and then I decided I'd better get Barry's advice. So I sneaked away and came over here. [ Telephone ] Excuse me. Hello? Oh. Just a minute. It is for you. Hello? Yes. Well, what was wrong? Well, don't you know? Oh. Yes. I will be there. Goodbye. - What's the matter? We have to take the picture over again tonight. The negatives are missing. They can't find them anywhere. Isn't that a rather odd thing to happen? Jane, I am scared. Do you see? Someone took the negatives so we would have to retake the picture. So that we would all have to come back there. Whoever it is wants another chance. Maybe tonight he will .. Won't bungle. Chilly, isn't it. If Barry were only here. Who was that on the phone? Mack. Mr McCormick. The boss. But how did he know you were here? I left word with Pop the elevator man to call me here if anyone wanted me. What are you going to do? - I don't know. I must get back. Listen. If I were you I'd tell Mack immediately. What's the matter? Are you afraid that he might be the one who .. Of course not. I'll tell him. Then you'd better tell the others too. And as soon as Barry gets home I'll rush him over. Thanks. "That only leaves Inspector Clinton for the detectives." "And Mr Craig for the detective fiction writers." "Now we have the jackpot question." In a moment the attendant will hold in front of you gentlemen ten objects. You will have only ten seconds to look at them and memorise as many as you can. They will then be taken away and you'll have five seconds to name each article. Alright, Miss. Now .. Mr Craig, if you step over here to this microphone please. And Inspector, if you would come up on my left. Alright, gentlemen. Are you ready? Alright. Here we are. One second. Two seconds. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Alright. Take it away. Alright, Mr Craig. It is your first guess. A pair of handcuffs. - One. A ring. - Two. A revolver. - Three. A cartridge clip. Four. A knife. - Five. A silver dollar. Six. A flashlight. Seven. A watch. Splendid. That is eight. Alright, Mr Craig. Come on Barry. Come on, Barry. A key. Excellent. And now, Inspector. The last one. I am sorry, Inspector. But your time is up. As so often happens, Inspector. You overlooked the obvious. Let him have four of my five seconds. That is a very sporting gesture. Alright, Inspector. Go ahead. If you are so smart, what is it? The great big beautiful tray that the other nine objects were resting upon. Correct. And that is the guy that can't remember to mail a letter. And now for the final score for the losing detective team: 200 points. And for the winning detective fiction writers team: 210 points. And now ladies and gentlemen, the Tom Taylor Cigar program is happy .. To present to the captain of the winning detective fiction writers team .. This beautiful 21-jewel wristwatch. Thank you. And to the less observant captain of the losing team. The Sherlock Holmes magnifying glass. Hiya, princess. What's the matter with the lights? On the blink again? Jane. Hey, Jane. It is nearly three o'clock. Could she have left me? I haven't done anything wrong in days. Wait a minute. When was it I squawked about the Yanks? No, that wasn't it. If she is upstairs playing gin rummy again .. Jane. Jane. Oh, sweetheart. What's the matter? What happened? How did it happen? Did you fall? Are you hurt, sweetheart? Why, it's Mrs Swanson. Thank heavens it's you, Mrs Swanson. I felt sure it was my wife. Lie down. You'll be alright. I'll get you some water. Easy does it now. You are alright. There you are. Oh, Mr Craig. Alright. What happened? You fell down? - No, sir. He struck me. - He did? Who did? I don't know. I never did get a good look at him. Is Mrs Craig alright? - Yes. Of course. I mean I don't know. I searched around but I can't find her. I do hope nothing happened. You can say that again. What was this man doing? He was listening at the door and your wife was talking to another woman. I could just hear their voices. What time was this? - Let me see. I finished scrubbing the upper floor at 7 o'clock. I came down here to put away my mop and my bucket and look at the furnace. Always, Mr Weaver has me tend the furnace before I go to bed .. Alright. But what happened? Well, as I came down the back stairs I saw this man. His back was to me. He was listening at your door and I called out. I don't know why I did. I guess I thought I could frighten him. He turned to run down the hall. I made a grab for him and he struck me. You didn't recognise the voice of the woman talking to me wife? Did you? - No, sir. Here, take a little drink of this. Listening to my wife. Now, why would anybody want to listen to my wife? I wonder what she's got herself mixed up in now. Bad news? - I hope not. You'll find an ice-bag in the bathroom, Mrs Swanson. You'd better put some cold applications on that head. Help yourself to anything you want, Mrs Swanson. Just make yourself at home. [ Female scream! ] What is the matter, lady? Oh, I am sorry. I .. I? I what? Well, for a minute I thought it was real. Well, that is just splendid. Too bad you aren't the advertiser. I'm sorry. Say, who told you to barge in like this anyway? I was looking for Miss Julie Taylor. She is in Studio 2. Second floor. Close that door when you go out, will you. We have work to do here. Excuse me. Julie. Oh, Julie. Jane. I was just going to telephone you. What about? What is wrong? - Nothing. Nothing is wrong. As a matter of fact, I was going to tell you not to bother to come over. Everything is going smoothly. We're all set to take the picture. I don't get it. Didn't you tell Mack and the others what happened this afternoon? No. No, I didn't. - Why not? Well. Because I came to the conclusion that I .. I was just imagining things. You mean, you imagined someone trying to grab you? You imagined you smelled chloroform? It could have been someone playing a joke. A joke? Besides, this picture means everything to the boss. If it doesn't turn out, he is finished. He is through. If Mrs Fleming and the others find out there's no telling what will happen. They might walk out on her before he gets the picture and then .. Mack would .. - Oh, I see. You are in love with Mack, aren't you? Mack is married. That doesn't answer my question. No. No. I'm not in love with him. Does that answer your question? Well. It is answer. He's a grand guy, Jane. If you met him you'd understand. - Why don't you introduce me to him? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. Of course I'll introduce you to him. I want you to meet all of them. Kirk can do it too. I've told them all about you. Jane. You won't say anything? - Of course not. What about Barry? I left a note for him to come here. Don't worry. I'll get to him first and explain everything. You are an angel. - Well, thanks. You'd better open the door a little wider and let my wings through. Excuse me. That's alright. [ Whistle ] That's it. Hold it. Now, move the candelabra a little more to the right. A little more. Just a little more. Hey, boys. Boys, I want you to meet Jane Craig. You've heard me speak of her and here she is in person. She really is cute. Mrs Jane Craig, Mr Fenley. This is Kirk. - How do you do. This is Harry Duerr, the assistant genius. Kirk, let go of her hand. Oh. How do you do. - Yeah. Mack. I want you to meet my pal, Jane Craig. Hello. Mack. - Huh? Oh, I am sorry. This is Jane Craig - Mr McCormick. Mr McCormick and I have met before. - Really? You have? Yes. I ran into him downstairs. He told me how to find you. Oh, yes, I remember. I am sorry if I was rude. That's alright. I had no business barging in like that. That is okay. Everything set, boys? Yes. All set. Better round up the people, Julie. - Yes, Mack. Look, if you'll stand right over here you can see exactly how it's done. I will only be a minute. Miss Lawrence. - Coming. Whenever you are ready, Mrs Fleming. I will be right there. Alright, folks. On the set please. - Okay. You own me a dollar and a half. - I know. I know. What time is it anyway? - Nine o'clock. Right on the dot. Don't say this thing comes off on time. - I hope so. I've got a date. Alright, folks. Take the same positions at the table you had this afternoon. Miss Lawrence, you sit here please. Careful of the silverware, folks. It has all been counted. Joke. - The joke is over. How does it look, Kirk? Terrific. Will you quit worrying? I'm not worrying. We're all set. Bring on Madam Queen. Alright, I will get her. Miss Ralston, as we do the take, can you look at the silver and not the camera? This picture is for Cottrell Silverware, not your Hollywood agent. Now look, Mr Fenley. If you don't like my work you can get someone else. Now, now, Miss Ralston. He didn't mean any harm. Just kidding. Well, I don't like the way he kids. I was just coming for you. - Good evening, Ralph. Good evening, aunt Isabel. I hate dragging you out on a miserable night like this, but .. I promised to deliver the photograph in the morning. Don't be absurd. I like rainy weather. I always did. My husband used to say I was a regular mud hen. You know, I cannot imagine what happened to those negatives. Ralph. Yes. What is it? That woman in the far corner. She wasn't here this afternoon. No, no. We couldn't locate the model that posed this afternoon so we have a substitute. Well, I am sorry. But she won't do. Won't do? I don't understand. I mean I will not be photographed with her. I don't like her. But aunt Isabel .. - Let's not argue. Get someone else. I will be in my dressing room. Folks, everyone go out and have a smoke. We're having a little technical trouble. Technical trouble? What are you talking about? I said 'technical trouble'. Oh. Oh, Miss Lawrence. The model who posed this afternoon has just arrived. And I think she will be a little more suitable so .. I am afraid we won't need you. I'll send you your check in the morning. Yes, Mr McCormick. I understand perfectly. What is this all about? - Mrs Fleming objected to her. Why? - She didn't say why. Well, what do you know? - Julie. You better get changed quick. You'll take her place. We haven't time to get another model. - Alright. Mind if I tag along, Julie? - No. Come on. Didn't she give any reason at all, Mack? - No. [ Crying noises ] [ Crying noises ] That reminds me. I must write Barry's uncle. Boy. Whoever tore up these negatives certainly, did a good job. Why would anyone do it? - I don't know. How did you happen to find them, Harry? - Well, I .. Threw an envelope in the basket when I was working in here today. And I suddenly remembered there was an address on it. So I came in here to get it and .. There you are. - Where is the envelope? I .. I .. It's right here. Wasn't it underneath the negatives? Underneath? Why, no. I didn't pay particular attention. I think it was to one side. Well, you got a pretty tight story anyway, Harry. Wait a minute, Kirk. If you're insinuating I tore those negatives .. Why, Harry. Nobody is accusing you of anything. Why did he say he's not accusing me? I'm sorry. I'm just a bit jittery today. Things have been so upset. Come on, boys. Let's get back to the set. Good evening. Decidedly. Assuming one is a duck. I am looking for my wife. Rather an unusual night to play hide-and-go-seek, isn't it? I was going to meet my wife here at the McCormick studios, but .. This place seems to be practically deserted. Maybe she is on the second floor. That's where they're taking the photos. I beg your pardon but if you are still looking for your wife .. Gee, is this as fast as this thing will go? Yep. Got it wide open. She don't go up like no rocket but she don't fall down like one either. How long have you been running an elevator, skipper? Well, now let me see. I got out of the Spanish-American war in '99. I was a bartender for ten years but had to give it up. My liver went bad on me. Let me see. That was '08. The same year I lost my teeth. Yep. I remember exactly because I got my plates in 1911. In '14 I got married. I didn't work for four years. Let me see now. My wife left me in '18 so I went back to work. So I have been here 23 years. Excepting 3 weeks back in '33 when they repealed the 18th amendment. So you tried bartending again, huh? Nope. Celebrating. Now my gall bladder is no good. Let me see. That makes 23 years minus 3 weeks. That's 22 years and 11 months and 1 week that I've been running this elevator. This has all been very interesting. Now, will you please open the door? Say, this is the second floor? Nope. The third. The second floor is the next one down. You want to go down to the second floor? - Of course. Certainly. Alright. Second floor it is. By the way, skipper. You said you lost your teeth one year. And you didn't get your plates until 3 years later. That's correct. - What held you up so long? Well, now that is a long story. For goodness, sakes. We'll end up in the basement. Nope. You'll end up back on the third floor. It takes a round trip to tell it. Are we here already? It does a little better downhill. Hello, princess. - Hello. Hi, Barry. I'll be with you in a minute. Tell Mrs Fleming her secretary is here to drive her home. Yes. Certainly. What's it all about, princess? Well, if you're through looking at the scenery. Sit down and I will tell you. [ Female scream! ] Julie. - Julie, what happened? What's happened to her? She saw that. Shut the door, Jane. Inspector. - Yes? I'm Ralph McCormick. - How do you do. Not so good. It happened on the second floor and I felt it best to keep everyone up there. Mr McCormick. - Yes? Was it you who phoned headquarters? - That's right. Going up. Going up. The report said Mrs Isabel Fleming. That's right. Say, old-timer. Can't we make a little more speed? Not unless you want to take the stairs. That is an idea. Drop her down. This thing will shake your teeth out. Not mine. I keep them buttoned up in my pocket. Step down please. So I fell down. You ride with the old boy in the elevator and find what he knows. It's down the hall, Inspector. Step up please. Alright. Let's go. Now, old-timer. I want to ask you a few questions. Fire away. What's your name? Edward E. Philpot. What's yours? - Gatling. Hey, I am asking the questions. How long you been working here? Well, let me see now .. I was mustered out of the Spanish-American war in 1899. Got a job right off bartending. I hung on to it up until the year after the panic in 1908. The same year I lost my teeth. Look. All I want to know is, how long have you been working here? Now you got me off the track. Let me see now. As I was saying. I got out of the Spanish-American war in 1899. Mr Kenyon, did you by any chance see Miss Lawrence leave? No I didn't. You knew her personally, didn't you? Only slightly. What do you do, Mr Kenyon? I am a dancer in a nightclub. Where is this nightclub? Just off Sheridan Square. The Club Cupid. Oh sure. I know that place well. That is, I've walked by it a good many times and saw the sign. It's a dump. But I won't be there always. - Where do you live? 322 Bank Street. That is .. The same building Mr Snyder lives in. Yeah. We live in the same apartment. Yeah. That is right. Right this way, Inspector. Good evening, Inspector. - Good evening. The body is in dressing room Number 2 here. Number 2, huh? What are you doing here? Just moseying around. Asking questions, taking notes. I have written them down. If you're interested you might save repetition. And by the way, I'd like you to meet my wife - Inspector Clinton. How do you do, Inspector? You made good time getting over here, Inspector. It only took you fifteen minutes. Why Barry, isn't that a new watch? Yes. The Inspector made me a present of it. Oh Inspector. How sweet. Do you mind telling me how you happen to be here? I just .. happened to drop in to pick up my wife. I see. And she just happened to be here? Well, no. You see, I .. Well, I .. Yes. You see, I happened to drop in to see a friend. Miss Taylor. Who happens to work here. And then the murder happened? You don't happen to know who did it? Unfortunately, no. You've done a very thorough job here. - Thank you. You don't mind if I look at the body, do you? Not at all. Go right ahead. - Thanks. What have you found out, Doc? The jugular vein was severed with a sharp instrument. Probably never knew what hit her. What did you find, Temple? - Only a handbag. The money and jewels are still in it. A pair of scissors. Could it have been the scissors? - No. The wound is big enough to have been made by a bayonet. Mathews. I hope I'm not in your way. Not at all. I can see over your shoulder. Mathews, have the men take a look round. See if they can find the weapon. There is a whole table full of knives out in the studio. You see, they were taking a picture advertising Cottrell silver. You can read all about it there in my notes. Here. Take your notes and .. Go and sit down someplace. Where is the studio? I will show you. If you need me just holler. It took me about thirty minutes to get here from the house. Fifteen minutes in the car and fifteen minutes in the elevator. When I got here, naturally I asked for Mrs Fleming. Miss Taylor went to find her and .. Well, that is when they discovered it. What is your name? Roland X. Smith. Roland. Smith. Please. 'X'. The name is Roland X. Smith. What is the X for? To distinguish me from all the other Roland Smiths. Listen, baby. I want to ask you a couple of questions. Okay. Shoot. Why did you come over here in the first place? Julie came to the apartment. After you. She expected something like this. What's that? I didn't quite catch you. Get over here on the other side of me. I can talk better over here. Don't act like a child, Barry. Come over here and I'll tell you all about it. Now let me see now. I got out of the Spanish-American war in '99. I was a bartender for 10 years but I had to give it up. My liver went bad on me. Who sat here? No-one sat there. You see, this end of the table wasn't in the picture. Oh. Mrs Fleming sat at the head. Who sat here on Mrs Fleming's right? Miss Lawrence sat there originally. - I see. She's the woman that Mrs Fleming objected to? That's right. Who took her place? - Miss Taylor. My assistant. Look at that table. Isn't there a piece of cutlery missing? Yes. The carving knife is gone. Within the easy reach of anyone who was seated there. Yes. But anyone might have picked it up. - Let me see that negative again. This picture was taken while Miss Taylor was seated here, wasn't it? Yes. But Miss Taylor is my .. It's absurd to think she .. No pictures were taken while Miss Lawrence was here? No. Have another look. Well, the knife is missing from the picture. Therefore, Miss Lawrence could have been here when the knife disappeared. Yes, I suppose she could have. What do you know about this Lawrence woman, Mr McCormick? Practically nothing. We've used her on several occasions. She always seemed to be a rather mild, quiet, good-natured woman. You have her address? - Yes. I suppose you have some photographs? Yes. I think we have a model's directory in the reception room. Oh. Let's take a look. Julie. Will you help us out please? Get the Models Directory. Yes. How did you prevail on so prominent a person as Mrs Fleming .. To pose for you, Mr McCormick? She was my wife's aunt. Oh. I may as well tell you that my wife is the sole heir to the Fleming fortune. Well, that doesn't necessarily place you under suspicion. You seem to have an up-and-coming business here. Haven't you? - I'm on the verge of bankruptcy. As a matter of fact I probably will go broke now. You see .. Mrs Fleming's death is really a terrible blow to me. How is that? Well. I was very fond of her. She was very fond of me. In fact, she was planning to help me out in my troubles. We had a long chat when she first arrived tonight. She promised to lend me thirty thousand dollars to carry on my business. Indeed? Yes. That is true. I know it is true. Mr McCormick would be stupid to do away with the person who could save him. Wouldn't he? Did you hear Mrs Fleming promise to lend him the money? Well .. Not exactly. You see .. I .. I told her. Now I get it. - Get what? Why Julie changed her attitude. You said that after begging you to have us come over here .. She treated you like a stepchild when you arrived. Yeah. Well, don't you see? Julie was afraid that it was Mack. Who was going to commit the murder. That is the new stuff they are using instead of nylon. Is that so? Then when she found out .. That Mrs 'rich witch' was going to lend him the money .. She figured the necessity for killing her was gone. So she wanted us to forget about the whole thing. I think you have got something there. You know, that stuff looks nice. Mrs McCormick. - Erika. Erika, if there's anything I can do .. My deepest sympathy. - Hello, dear. I tried to get you at the apartment. I was out to dinner. I want you to meet Inspector Clinton. Inspector, this is my wife. - Mrs McCormick. I'm sorry to meet you under such unhappy circumstances. Won't you take a seat? I would like to ask you a few questions when I can get to you. Here it is, Inspector. 'Madge Lawrence'. 'Height 5 feet 9'. '130 pounds. Eyes brown. Hairy greyish'. You have Miss Lawrence's address? - Yes. I have it downstairs in my files. Do you mind giving it to officer Temple? Not at all. Better take a couple of men with you. - Alright, Inspector. From 1911 to '13 I went back to my old job as bartender. I had to quit. My liver again. Mrs McCormick. When was the last time you saw your aunt? I had lunch with her yesterday. Did she give any indication at that time that she feared for her life? She has never at any time expressed fears for her life. Oh. What's the matter? I beg your pardon? I said, what is the matter? Nothing, sir. I suppose that was just your tonsils backfiring, huh? Yes, sir. I mean, no sir. If you're asking my opinion. Which you're not. I think he got a little shocked from .. This picture. Do you know Miss Lawrence? - Miss Lawrence? No, sir. Do you know this lady in the picture? No, sir. - Well, what startled you? I don't know. I am a bundle of nerves. The whole thing is silly. I'm just imagining things. That's all. Imagining what? What is silly? I felt I knew the woman in the picture, but it can't be. I've not seen her for 10 years. This woman looks younger than she should look after 10 years. Who? Mrs Fleming, of course. Mrs Fleming? Well, if that is Mrs Fleming who is that in there? The second Mrs Fleming. And that is the first Mrs Fleming, isn't it. Yes. Then you did recognise her? Yes. I .. I don't know. Of course you do. A person doesn't change much in ten years. Why, I bet you haven't yourself. Well. My hair is a little thinner. Nonsense. I doubt you had more hair when you worked for the first Mrs Fleming .. Than you have now. Really, I never worked for the first Mrs Fleming. But you did know her, didn't you? - Only by sight. I saw her a few times at the trial. - What trial? Now, wait a minute. I hate to interrupt what seems to be a private conversation. Inspector. Give me a few minutes and I'll clear this whole thing up for you. Quiet. Inspector. We are only trying to help you out. I realize that and I am trying to help you out. Matthews, open that door. You mean ..? - That's exactly what I mean. Well. If that is the way you feel about it. We're only trying to be off assistance. This thing was just beginning to simplify itself nicely. Inspector, you are nothing but a silly self-centered, grumpy old man. You spoke about a trial. What trial was that? Inspector. Roland has been a loyal employee of my aunt for many years and .. He is obviously reluctant to drag out the family skeletons. Perhaps I can tell you what you want to know. Good. Is that the first Mrs Fleming? I would not know. It happened when I was so young and most of it was kept from me for many years. However, being curious I finally got to the bottom of it all. My uncle divorced the first Mrs Fleming fifteen years ago. A few months afterwards he married aunt Isabel. Later, he died and left his entire estate to aunt Isabel. With the exception of $500,000 which he left to the first Mrs Fleming. The trial which Roland spoke of was about the will. My aunt Isabel resented my uncle's first wife so deeply that .. She declared my uncle insane in order to break the will. Are you through questioning me already? Already? Not until I learn to write with my left hand I am. Hey you. Hey, wait a minute. Well, if it isn't machine-gun Gatling. Lieutenant Gatling - my wife. - How do you do. What you doing around here? - Nothing, Lieutenant. We're just going home. - Maybe you are and maybe you ain't. Does the inspector know you are around? Huh? Yes. Of course. Certainly. We just left him. He told us to go on home. He did, huh? How long have you been around here? Well, since before the murder, but .. And the inspector told you to go home? Before you go, he'd tell me he told you to go home. He'll tell you alright. - Come on. We go upstairs. The inspector won't like you returning us. Don't tell me what he don't like. I've been with him too long. You're to stop the whispering too. Sorry. How long have you been running this elevator, Pop? Well, let me see now. I got out of the Spanish-American war in 1899 .. Oh, no you don't. We'll walk. The Spanish-American war. Come on. Step down please. Hey, chief. Look who I found trying to sneak out of the building. Surprised, ain't you? There ain't anybody sneaking out on you while I'm around, boss. [ Telephone ] Now I'm hearing bells ringing. McCormick Studios. Yes. Just a moment. It is for you, Inspector Clinton. Huh? Hello. Yes, Temple? Dead? Are you sure? Are you sure, Joe? She is either dead or my watch stopped. Positively. It looks like she took an overdose of sleeping tablets. Yes, sir. The place is right around the corner. You can get here in 5 minutes. Hey, Charlie. Look. Hold on a second, Inspector. I think Henderson has found something. Yes, sir. We have found that missing knife. Good work, boys. I'll be right over. Madge Lawrence, the first Mrs Fleming, murdered Isabel Fleming. And then committed suicide. Alright. Thank you all for your cooperation. You can all go home now. [ Scream! ] What is it? What now? What's the matter? - I left a pot roast in the oven. There they go. Come on. The case is closed. Why go looking for chloroform cans at this time of the morning? Because usually the druggist's name is on the label. I want to find out who bought that can. Give me a hand. It's slippery. Help me up. You stay there, princess. Where it's safe. You stink. [ Scream! ] Hello. Hello. Wake up. Police. The McCormick Studios. Darling. You alright? - Who was that shooting? I didn't stop to ask. Why did you scream? I saw a ghost. - Nonsense. There's no such things as ghosts. That's what I thought until a minute ago. Turn out the light. Look. - What's the matter? It's back again. - What's back again? The ghost. Back again. Where? I don't see it. Right over there. - Where? Come out of there. Darling. Are you alright? Say something. I got out of the Spanish-American war in 1899 .. It is only poor old Pop. He probably thought we were thieves. I got a job bartending .. [ Police siren ] The police. - Yeah. I called them. We'd better get out of here before we're arrested for breaking and entering. Get away from me! Don't you touch me! Lay a hand on me and I will kill you. Good morning. - Morning. Thank you. Bill. Bad. Bill. Bill. Mail. Anything for me? - They are all for you. How wonderful. Make sure to get the paper. I got it. Barry, will you put the garbage out in the hall. I was just going to. You don't have to watch me, baby. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Jane. I'll be back in a little while. I'm going down to police headquarters. Wait a minute. I can't wait. I must go right away. What's the idea? You're not going to go there without me. I want to go too. Now, princess. What do you want to do, stop traffic? Now, Jane. You know you can't go out in the cold right after a hot shower. I won't be gone long. All I want to do is .. Gee, you smell good. So soft and warm. Hey, what am I doing? I have to hurry. I have to. Do you, darling? It's murder. Maybe that will change your mind. I found that in the back hallway. Just outside the door of my apartment. The man who listened to Miss Taylor and my wife .. Likely dropped it fighting with the housekeeper. So what? So that proves the eavesdropper was from the McCormick Studio. How? Good heavens, man. It has got 'Prop Room' marked right there on it. Obviously it's the key to the prop room of the McCormick Studios. Does it say McCormick Studios on the tag? No. There are hundreds of property rooms, Mr Craig. Every theater has a property room. Every furniture store has a property room. 'Prop room' is quite a common term. But it all ties up. Madge Lawrence, or the first Mrs Fleming as you call her .. Was not engaged until evening. Someone tried to chloroform Julie Taylor in the afternoon. That same someone followed her to our apartment. When she came to call on my wife. Furthermore, it was a man. Not a woman. Mrs Swanson caught a glimpse of him before he knocked her down. Then the first Mrs Fleming couldn't have murdered the second Mrs Fleming, huh? That's right. Then why was the knife that killed the second Mrs Fleming .. Found in the first Mrs Fleming's apartment? Planted. - Oh, planted. That is ridiculous. Nobody left the McCormick Studios. And yet you say somebody planted that knife in the Lawrence woman's apartment. I have got it. Whoever killed Isabel Fleming .. Put the knife in the first Mrs Fleming's suitcase before she left the studio. Probably, she never knew she had it. How did the murderer get her to take an overdose of sleeping tablets? Coaxed her over the telephone? Maybe the overdose was an accident. You yourself said she was in the habit of taking sleeping tablets. Yes. And I found out she had a motive. And I found out she had the knife. And I found out that everybody else has an alibi. And I'm beginning to find out that you're getting to be a bit of pest. If you pardon me I have some work to do. - Then you won't reopen the case? Not on the strength of the puny evidence you brought up. Alright, Inspector. But I am going to find out who killed Isabel Fleming. I'll bet you 5-2 it wasn't Madge Lawrence. When you find out Mr Craig, will you let us know so we can arrest them please? Will you answer me just one question? We aim to please. Did you check to see if the Lawrence woman's fingerprints were on that knife? Okay. Imagine that cluck. Of course you checked if the Lawrence dame's fingerprints were on the knife. Didn't you, chief? Sure. I knew you did. And her fingerprints were not on the knife. Huh? Hello, Lewis. - Hi, Craig. Hey, Mr Craig. Wait a minute. Barry. How about a story on the Fleming case? - Stand aside. Let me get this picture. Have you any theories, Barry? Yes, of course. Quite a few. - Well, go ahead. Let's hear them. Well, in my opinion that the death of the first Mrs Fleming .. Had nothing to do with the murder of the second. What do you mean? I mean, I believe the murderer of Isabel Fleming is still at large. Still at large? Put it right on top, son. Give him the money, dear. My name is headlined in every newspaper in the city. Princess, you are married to a very famous man. Yes. And so modest. - I can afford to be. I wouldn't be surprised to find newsreel cameramen inside to take pictures of me. Barry. I think the lock has been tampered with. Don't be silly. Oh, Barry. Let me go. - Let her go. Honey. What? What's this all about? Who are these guys? I don't think they are the newsreel cameramen. Here. Let me help you up. Now look, fathead. You've been running off at the mouth all day about what you think. And what you suspect. You know? If you want to stay healthy, keep your mouth shut and mind your own business. You know? Don't get any more ideas about the Fleming case. Or you'll wind up in the headlines again but you won't be able to read them. You know? - Whoever hired you must be .. Whoever hired me told me to give you this. Oh, darling. When he wakes up, you'd better remind him what is good for him. You know? I'll get you a drink. Here. Take this. Wait a minute. I'm the one who got hit. - Sorry. I'm all confused. He pulled a Sunday punch on me. He'd never have got away with it if he hadn't pulled a Sunday punch. You know what this proves, don't you? That Madge Lawrence's suicide had nothing to with Isabel Fleming's death. Right. Her death just happened to work in favor of the real killer. You know, my theory was that Madge Lawrence .. Took an overdose of sleeping tablets. You know? Maybe accidentally. Maybe on purpose. But her only part in the case was .. That the murderer planted the knife in her bag .. Knowing her true identity would come out and she'd be blamed. But darling, I know all that. You've bent me ear all day telling me. Can't you see it's true? That's why the killer hired the hoodlums to scare me off. I am getting hot on the trail, you know. And if you don't watch out you will cool off in the morgue. Not me. I know how to take care of myself. Sure you do. I bet you broke that hoodlum's fist with your jaw. Oh? So a guy gets knocked down and you lose all your confidence in him? Now Barry, I didn't mean it that way. I have all the confidence in the world in you. That's why I want you to go on with this thing. You will get closer and closer .. First thing you know, you'll get killed. This is dangerous business, Barry. Drop it. Are you suggesting that I behave like a coward? I am just suggesting that you behave. Listen, princess. Someday, we hope to have a child. And I don't want the child to grow up to point the finger of shame at its father. Then we'll teach him not to point. No use trying to kid me out of it, Jane. My job is to get to the bottom of this. To the bottom alright. Of the east river. Look, honey. I'm just going over to the McCormick Studios to have a look around. I want you to stay here. Don't be silly. After all, if I will end up as a widow I have a right to see how it is done. [ Buzzer ] Who do you suppose that is? - I don't know. But this time they're not going to pull a Sunday on me. Whoever it is, is going to have to fight fair and square. Good evening, Mr Smith. Have a seat. - Thank you. Sit down, Mr Smith. Would you care for a little sherry? Thank you, no. I believe not. - You're sure? On second thoughts I think I will. I need something to quiet my nerves. Let me take your hat. I feel like I've been run through a ringer. What's bothering you? Your theory in the papers. Thank you. Ever since I read it I have been on needles and pins. I just didn't know what to do. First I felt I'd have a talk with you. Then I thought I mustn't talk with you. Then I said Yes to myself. Then I said No to myself. I'm all worn out from the argument. I know exactly how you feel. Thank you. Now that you are here, old man. What's on your mind? Lee Kenyon. Lee Kenyon? - Yes, darling. He's a model who works in the nightclub where you read the sign walking by. Oh yes. What about him, Mr Smith? Just this. Two days before Mrs Fleming was .. Before she passed away. This Kenyon person came to the house. I don't know if it was by appointment. But just before he arrived .. Mrs Fleming sent me to the bank and had me draw out $10,000 in cash. I thought it was extraordinary too. But that isn't all. This morning, I checked Mrs Fleming's effects and the $10,000 is gone. I'd better run down to that nightclub and have a talk with Kenyon. My car is outside. I'd be very glad to run you over. That's so sweet of you, Mr Smith. You only have a small coup?, haven't you Mr Smith? Oh no. I have a large sedan. That is what I said. Good evening, Mr Craig. Good evening, Mr Craig. Good evening, Mr Craig. This way, Mr Craig. So, you just walked by the place? They probably saw my picture in the paper. I told you not to take that last drink. [ Door knocks ] Come in. A friend to see you, Mr Kenyon. Oh. Mr Craig. Come in. Have a seat. - Thank you. Doesn't this left shoulder look a little too padded? Not at all. A beautiful suit. New? - Yes. Now, Mr Craig. I have been reading about you in the paper today. Oh? - What can I do for you? Do for me? - Yeah. I'm not egotistical enough to think you came down here just to see me dance. I see. Whatever questions you want to ask me, go ahead. I'll try to answer them if I can. Alright. Who is your tailor? Max Morris. Oh. Forgive me for even asking that question. He charges about $200 for a suit of clothes, doesn't he? Yes. Yes. He is rather high, but .. A man has to wear well-tailored clothes when he's before the public. Of course. Besides, what's two hundred dollars to a man who has ten thousand? Ten thousand dollars? Me? Ten thousand? Why .. Where would a guy like me get ten thousand dollars? From the late Mrs Isabel Fleming? Look, Mr Craig. You can't get me mixed up in this thing. I don't know anything about it. I swear I don't. I admit I got ten thousand dollars from the old lady. But I had nothing to do with knocking her off. Maybe. Maybe not. But you are not telling me she gave you that money just because she liked you? No. No. Of course not. She gave me the money to stay away from Erika. From Mrs McCormick? Yeah. You see, Erika told her she was going to divorce Mack and marry somebody else. The old lady thought it was me. So she called me up there and offered me ten grand to stay away from Erika. Naturally, I took the money. Well. I thought it was a good joke on the old lady. Especially since I hadn't seen Erika in over a year. You mean, you weren't the man Erika was in love with? Certainly not. Erika and I used to be good friends but that is all it amounted to. Where did you meet her? Through Mack? No. I knew her before Mack did. Harry Duerr introduced us. As a matter of fact, Duerr introduced Mack to her. She and Duerr were kids together. Having a good time? I was. Is that all you came down here for? Just to have a good time? What else? Where is your boyfriend? I was just wondering about that myself. He must have wandered away somewhere, I guess. But he will come back. He always does. That's swell. We'll hang around and have another little chat with him. You know? You don't have to. He made up his mind to keep his nose out of the whole thing. Good, We will wait. And congratulate him on using his brain. Alright. Suit yourself. Do you mind if I leave you for a minute to powder my nose? Wait a minute. You don't want to get this coat all covered with powder. You know. Leave it here. It will be here when you get back. Very well. But keep a good eye on it. I just got it. Barry. What is it? What's the matter? Barry. Those two hoodlums. They're waiting out front for you. Kenyon, is there any way out of here without going back through the caf?? There's a fire door in the chorus room. But the girls are making a change. Oh? Come on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Blindfold yourself, dear.???? I'll see if it's alright. Girls. Come in. Listen, girls. I would like to bring a gentleman through here. But it's a matter of life and death and besides, he will be blindfolded. Okay. Bring him through. Thanks for everything, girls. Why, it is Mr Craig. Hello, Mr Craig. They must know me from my books. Don't tell me they can read too. Phillip. Here is the money for our drinks. - Thank you, sir. Look. Next time, they will know better. You know? What did you find out from Kenyon? - I'll tell you on the way to Julie's. Taxi. What can we find out from Julie? - Taxi. You thought she was in love with Mack, didn't you? Yes. Well, when a dame is in love with a guy .. It's only natural for her to know who the guy's wife is in love with. Hey. Taxi. We'd like to see Julie Taylor please. Just tell her it is Mr and Mrs Craig. I am sorry. Miss Taylor checked out about fifteen minutes ago. Checked out? This time of night? Where did she go? I don't know, sir. She didn't leave a forwarding address. That's strange. Yes. Isn't it. After being here for two years. I asked her about her mail and she didn't answer me at all. She just rushed right on by. Well, thanks very much. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Hello? I wonder if that can have been ..? No. No? - No. Hey, maybe it was .. No. No? - No. What time is it? It is ten after twelve. [ Telephone ] Hello? Yes. He is here. Who is calling? This is Erika McCormick. Oh. Just a minute. It's Erika McCormick. Hello? Mr Craig? Mr Craig, you've got to help me. I just found out something. I know who killed .. Hello? Hello? Cut off. Now what? I'm going over there to have a talk with her. Maybe she'll ring again. Why don't you call her back? I've a hunch there's something happening over there. Whatever it is, I hope it happens before we get there. Hey, give us a line on this, will you? It was the McCormick dame, wasn't it? - When can Inspector Clinton talk to us? When the Inspector wants to talk to you guys, he will talk to you guys. How about talking to Henderson or Gatling then? Nobody gets inside. Do you understand? Did you tell the boys to come up? - I sure did, Doc. What did you find out, Doc? Well, she was strangled alright. We may find out more with an autopsy but I doubt it. Do you feel like answering a few more questions, Mr McCormick? Well, if I didn't, I would have to answer them anyway, wouldn't I. No. Not necessarily. Still, it might help. Go ahead. How long were you here before you telephoned headquarters? I told you before. I had just arrived. I went into the bedroom and found .. I found her and I called you immediately. You were out all evening? Yeah. I was at the studio working on the books. I suppose you can supply witnesses to corroborate your statement? I am afraid not. Unless the elevator man happened to see me. No. Unfortunately for you he didn't. We've already checked with him. Alright. Alright. If you think I did it why not arrest me and have it over with? You seem more concerned with your own predicament than with your wife's death. You were on friendly terms, I suppose? Well .. I may as well tell you. You will find out anyway. This afternoon my wife told me that .. She was going to divorce me. Well, Mr McCormick. I am afraid we will have to hold you. Good morning. - Morning. Thank you. - Don't forget the paper, dear. I'm glad you don't deliver the milk. Bill. Bill. Hey. There's one here that isn't a bill. Oh, good. Good. Barry, it's a letter from Julie. What is so exciting about .. Julie? 'Dear Jane'. 'I suppose it's cowardly for me to run away but I can't bear to hang around ..' 'And see the grandest person I've ever known suffer'. 'Yes. You guessed it from the start. I love Mack McCormick'. 'But he doesn't know I'm alive. However I would like to help him if I could'. 'That's why I am writing to you, Jane'. 'He is in so much trouble and the reopening of this ..' 'Case will just make it more difficult for him, so ..' 'Won't you please ask Barry to let the matter drop'. 'I am sure the police have the proper solution to Mrs Fleming's death'. 'There is no need to ask questions'. 'They are only bringing out a lot of gossip and unpleasantness'. 'Please Jane. Devotedly, Julia'. 'P.S'. 'I just called Mack at the studio'. 'If only you could have heard his voice'. 'So tired and unhappy'. The poor kid. New York Central stationery. Evidently, she wrote the letter at the railroad station. Let me see the envelope. Picked up at .. 1 am. She obviously thinks Mack did it. Uhuh. Running away to keep from being questioned. She probably doesn't even know about Erika's death. Barry, Mack was at the studio. She followed him there. I wonder at what time. Where is my hat? - Here we go again. Show him the letter. When did you get this? - This morning. Why didn't you tell the police Julie called? That would prove you were at the studio. I dragged her into this. - What time did she call? Huh? What time did she call? About a quarter past twelve. That is when Erika phoned you. And she was killed right then to keep her from talking. That proves you didn't do it. Erika called you? What is that? Mack. We've no time to answer questions. We only have time to ask one. Will you answer it? If I can. Who engaged Madge Lawrence to pose for the picture? I don't know. But Julie would know. And we don't know where Julie is. Well, unless we find Julie .. Hey. I've got it. Come on, princess. You wait here until we get back. Don't worry. I will. What now? Listen, baby. You used to be an actress. Do you think you could sound like Julie over the telephone? Why .. I don't know. Well, make up your mind. Yes or no? Well. Maybe. - Good. Come on. Oh Barry. Whatever you're figuring on doing .. I don't like it. Hello, boys. Oh, hello Craig. Just what do you want around here? I just wondered if you had seen Julie. - No. She checked out of her apartment last night. You know that. - Yes. But how do you know? We called her apartment house this morning. The clerk said you'd been round looking for her last night. Or rather he said, a nosy guy with a good-looking woman. It sounded like you. Did you find her? No. But my wife received a letter from her this morning. I have it right here. What did I do with that letter? I must have lost it. Yeah. I'll bet you did. Well, here is the envelope. You can see it was mailed last night. What do you want around here, Craig? What are you after? Oh, I was .. Just trying to find out who killed .. Isabel Fleming and Erika McCormick. I think Julie can tell me. Alright. So why don't you go and find her and ask her? I know where she is or I will know in a few minutes. She'll phone me here at .. Ten o'clock. You see, gentlemen. There are only four people who could possibly be guilty. Mack. Kenyon. You. And you. Whoever it was planned Isabel Fleming's murder beautifully. The object of the murder was to get the Fleming fortune .. Into the hands of Erika McCormick. According to that reasoning it was Mack. He's the only one who'd profit by it. Mack was terribly hard up I know, but .. I don't believe he did it. No. Mack wouldn't profit by it. You see, Erika had already applied for a divorce. I didn't know that. - Didn't you? Well, Erika was in love with another man. That man wanted her to get the Fleming fortune. Before her married her. And .. that man is the murderer. Somehow Erika found out that he was the murderer so he had to kill her too. Now, let's take Kenyon. Whoever killed Isabel Fleming .. Hired Madge Lawrence knowing the story of the family feud would come out .. And she would be blamed. Kenyon, who was only another model, could not possibly have hired Madge. That leaves .. Just you two. Jabber, jabber, jabber. When Julie telephones .. She will tell me which of you employed Madge. That's all I have to know. Why don't you go away? How do you account for Lawrence's death? Oh. An accident. She was nervous over the scene she had with Isabel Fleming .. And took an overdose of sleeping tablets. But the knife? It was planted in her bag before she left the studio. Very interesting. Yeah. It sounds like another one of your corny books. [ Telephone ] Hello? Who? This is Julie. Who is this? This is Kirk. Kirk, is Barry Craig there? Yes. He is right here. Hello? Oh, Julie? Julie, I want you to answer me just one question. Now think hard. Who was it that engaged Madge Lawrence? Who? Who? Is that really Julie? No. It's Craig's wife. Alright, boys. You win. It's no use. It didn't work. Okay. Goodbye. Well .. I tried. And a good try it was too. But I warn you about one thing. Julie will show up the minute she finds out that Mack is in jail. [ Telephone ] Hello? Long distance? Yes, yes. I will take the call. Hello? Julie. Where are you? Yeah. Yeah, Mack is in jail. Yes. It looks pretty black for him. Sure. We're doing all we can .. - Give me that phone! Julie, this is Barry Craig. We can help Mack if you'll tell me just one thing. Who was it that made the phone call that engaged Madge Lawrence to pose? Alright, Craig. You can put that phone down. And keep your hands in the air. Now turn around. Both of you. If it hadn't been for your meddling, Craig, I'd have gotten away with it. So, I owe you something and now I'm going to pay you back. If you've got any prayers to say you had better make it quick. Now listen. - Keep out of it, Harry. This guy has been begging for a killing since he first walked into this place. And now he is going to get it. Alright. Are you ready hotshot? He's alright. He just fainted. Good work, boys. Ah, it was nothing. Will you help me get him on the bed? Barry. Barry. There's your husband, Mrs Craig. He just fainted. Darling. Wake up. What has happened to you? Are you hurt? Oh, darling. Hurt? I'm dead. If this is heaven, how did that guy get in here? It's lucky for you we happened along. Happened along? I knew you were following me. What detained you? Dear, did I sound like Julie on the phone? No. He recognised your voice immediately. But then I got the first break I've had since I've been on this case. Just after you telephoned, Julie herself called. But that wasn't Julie. That was me too. You? Yes. I called the second time and Duerr answered the phone. So I pretended I was long distance and then that I was Julie. Princess, you're wonderful. Congratulations, Mrs Craig. Thank you, Inspector. 0h, darling. Do you feel strong enough to go home now? Sure. I'm as steady as a rock. Well, Inspector. If you ever get in any trouble again. Let me hear from you. Look out, Craig! Dear. ..w-g..
