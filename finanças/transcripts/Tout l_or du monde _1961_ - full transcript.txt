No need to hurry. We've got plenty of time. You're in quite a hurry. You don't own the road, peasant. You're not very polite. You should get a kick up the ass. Hello, boss. Old houses. - Some are more than 500 years old. We'll tear them down. Shall we? - You'll enjoy it. Mr Victor Hardy, Mr the Mayor and the town councillors. Our town is attracting attention... because, according to the official statistics... We read it in the paper. Our photographer has already started. Isn't that great? He died at 85 and his wife at 93. Photo. And this one lived from 1850 to 1938. Picture. This one lived until 92. That one too. - And the centenarians? There are plenty of them. Look, 1858-1959. 101 years old. And look at this one. Even older. And that one. People get old here. - We'll buy it all. For nothing. And then we sell it again. - With a catchy slogan. Wait. No. People live long here. - Long living... Longuevie. - Longuevie... Longuevie, the perfect choice. - With good publicity. If you love life, you'll live in Longuevie. IF YOU LOVE LIFE YOU'LL LIVE IN LONGUEVIE THE DOMAIN OF LONGUEVIE HERE BEGINS THE DOMAIN OF LONGUEVIE GOLF COURSE OF LONGUEVIE WILL OPEN HERE THERMAL SPA OF LONGUEVIE DRINK WATER OF YOUTH HERE HERE WE'RE BUILDING THE CASINO OF LONGUEVIE The city council of Cabosse... - Thank you, Mayor. Thank you. All ours. - Well done, Fred. The hard bit was to make them sell for very little. Did they all sign? - Yes, except one. He wants to see you. And he's here. - Let him in. Mr Dumont, come in. Mr Hardy is here. Yes, through here. Through the door. They're a bit simple here. - Good for us. Where's his property? - Here. The one that's not marked. In the middle of the territory. And the spring is there. He doesn't have a clue. Come in, Mr Dumont. Nice to meet you, Mr Dumont. - We've already met. When did I have the honour? - The other day. On the road. Your driver wasn't very polite. - How's that possible? He said I should get a kick up the ass. I can't imagine. - So I'm lying? Don't go. We believe you. - It was a misunderstanding. He'll reprimand his driver. - Quite seriously too. Sit down there and sign there. He deserves a kick up the ass. That's right. - You're absolutely right. You agree with me? - Absolutely. Go get him then. - Who? Your driver. So you can reprimand him. Very funny. Good old Mr Dumont can be so funny. Sign, please. We'll do the rest. - We'll punish the guilty party. First the kick under his ass. Then we'll talk. You're kidding. - You don't really want... I don't want anything. You want something from me. Please, Mr Dumont. - Can't we talk about it? Mr Hardy only wants the best for you. Sit down, so we can talk. Or are you in a hurry? I'm never in a hurry. I have all the time in the world. The boy seems to be surprised. He's getting used to the idea. Put yourself in his place. I think he asked for time to think. - He's right. You should never rush. All of that is his. It's got to happen. Come. Come. - I'll go alone. No need for witnesses. Hurry up a bit. Mr Dumont? - Who's that? I'm ready for it. - What do you want? I don't want anything. You want something. Oh, is it for... There was no rush. Go ahead. He hit me hard. Done. Let him sign, so we can go. I don't want to see that old man anymore. It's not all done yet. - What? Oh, yes. Those people are brutes. They speak another language. Wasn't that the agreement? - It looks that way. You only need to sign there. I only need to sign there. Then I'll sign there. Agreed then. But I have to talk to Toine first. Toine? - My son. But your son isn't the owner, is he? No, I am. But who left it to me? My father. And he got the house from his father. It went from father to son, ever since there have been Dumonts. I won't sell it without talking to Toine first. It's not possible. What's keeping you, Fred? - One moment. You have to go talk to Toine. I will when I see him. - Right away. Right now? But he's up there. - Up there? In the mountains, with the sheep. - Then we'll go there. Into the mountains? I used to go there when I was young. It's a two day walk and there are no roads. When will he be back? At the end of summer. With the sheep. Are you coming? - I'm coming. Don't you want some soup? - No, thanks. Some other time. Toine, don't you recognize me? - It's the mayor. You gave me a fright. - We came to say hello. Hello, Toine. Nice to meet you. He's the spitting image of his father. Who's that? - A friend of your father's. He offered me a bowl of soup earlier. And he told me that he wants to talk to you. Is that true? - Yes, it is. Would you like to fly with us? Me in that thing? Me? That sounds like fun. Mr Dumont. - Mathieu. Hello, dad. What are you doing here? - Didn't you want to see him? I said at the end of summer. When he's back with the sheep. Say hello to your father and tell him to be sensible. You're not getting in before the sheep are back. You said he wanted to see me. - I'll solve it. You're so stubborn. - I'll teach you. You're not going to kill me, are you? - It's only lead shot. To chase the apple thieves away. Go away or I'll shoot. All Dumonts were pigheaded, but you're the worst. He wanted to shoot me. Me, the mayor. I'll go. Listen, Mr Dumont. - I won't listen to anything. He belongs with his sheep. - But you wanted... At the end of summer. When I say something, I mean it. I want to clear something up. This isn't your son's fault. It's not? And who's looking after the sheep now? - The sheep? Yes. You tell me. Your father wanted to know... - Who's looking after the sheep? Well, the Beard. The Beard looks after them. - He doesn't know anything about them. With his cousin. - Good. His cousin's there too. - Which cousin? I think the cousin of the Beard. He's laughing. That cousin is a loser. No, it's not that cousin. Which cousin then? - The other cousin is the loser. It's the other cousin. Toine, I told you not to come into the house. But he's your son. - Surely, he can come in. I live here and I'm not a little boy anymore. No? We'll see about that. And tomorrow... - The opening ceremony. All those journalists. - The radio, the guests of honour. It'll be a big failure. - Because of this pigheaded man. If only we could... - Kill him. That will be hard. Although. I'll explain, Toine. - Maybe we were too pushy. He hit me. At my age. - I'm sorry for you. We're very sorry. This is the thing. We want to buy your house and land and your father... Open that door, Toine. - One moment. We have permission of your father. I could have hit back. - But it wouldn't have solved anything. You have to come to an agreement about the sale. Are you going to open or not? - In a moment. Your dad said yes. Now you. - I have to go. Yes, go to Paris, for instance. To a place without problems. - Anywhere. If you prefer the countryside, we'll build something. So you can live another kind of life. A life that suits you. Actually, it's your duty. Good grace. Open up or I'll get my axe. We've finished. You agree. Now we'll speak to your father. Maybe he'll understand what he did. - Of course. When I'll be at the bottom of the well. At the bottom of the well? - Yes, that's what he said. Locking me out. Where is he? - You're wrong, Mr Dumont. I tended sheep until I was 40. And now get lost. Toine, show yourself. Where are you? Toine isn't here, Mr Dumont. - I know where he is. Help, Mr Hardy. Help. What are you doing near my well? Get away from there. These guys think they can do anything. Stay there. Don't move. I'll show them. Grab it, Toine. Grab it. Let me get a cartridge. He's so clumsy. Work with us. I should have let you do it, idiot. Look where you would have been without him. In that black hole. - The big nothing. I'll give you some lead shot. These things never work when you need them. Good grace. That's glowing hot. What did I do to the good Lord? I'll get them for this. Don't give him too much to drink, Rose. Poor Toine. You know him. He's not a bad drunk. And I'm here to defend your honour. I'm counting on you, Mr Jules. Good evening, Rose. Pick a card. Did you see it? Now put it back. Come here, closer. Hearts for a beautiful girl. And I'm the King of Hearts. I know all the tricks. You'll see. Where do you buy your hair? - It's real. I love long hair. - But combing it takes long. It's fast to loosen. Don't move. Don't touch. Look at yourself. Imagine yourself in Paris like this. In a carriage on the Champs Elys?es. Everybody will be looking at you. But here... such sadness. What are you doing in a hole like this? What are you going to do? - Talk to him. To whom? - My old man. Didn't he kick you out? - What will you say to him? Yes, tell us that. Wait. Let's pretend I'm your dad. You come in. - I come in. What do you say to me, your dad? I demand apologies. - What for? You kicked me and hit me. - Really? Apologies. - No way. Now it's my turn. - Yes, that's enough. You can't do that to your dad. - Oh no? When I was 9, I had to start tending sheep and I'm still doing it. I don't see anything of the world. Like Paris. What do you want in Paris? - What do I want here? I work but I don't make anything. What if I want to marry? Marry? Who'd want you? Don't say that. I have rights like everybody else. I'm not a beast. I didn't say that. - You don't care about me. Well, that will change. If you hit me, I'll hit you back. Maybe I can only look after sheep, but you don't need to tell me that. What do I care. Good night. You won't say all that to your dad. You never talk to people. You think? - You never talk to me either. I'm always talking to you. When? When I'm alone. Rose, it's past closing time. I'm closing, Madame. Where will you sleep? - Why do you care? I'm asking, ain't I? Do you wonder where I sleep when I'm in the mountains? There's a barn there. The door's open. Thanks. That's good enough for me. I'm not from Paris. Do you really think about me in the mountains? You can't always think of sheep. Good night, Toine. - Good night. Believe me. You'll never talk to people. Long live Longuevie. And long live Longuevie's godmother. Stella, the queen of the chanson. No entry This way, Stella. That will be a funny picture. Do that nonsense somewhere else. - We're working. Pretend you're sitting on it. You're not allowed here. - We don't care. Sing something. It makes your face light up. Go away, you. - Shut up, old man. You should be at the cemetery. Smile. I'll shoot you in the butt. - Did he say butt? Mark your words, old man. Are you asking for it? You'll get it. Fine. Turn. Thanks. What's its title? - Eternal Youth. I thought as much. Very expressive. Very expressive, sir. A piece of art. Mr Mayor, ladies and gentlemen. As the philosopher said so aptly... The future is everything that hasn't happened yet. But the future is no less necessary than the past. The past has not become more necessary because it has happened... but to prove it was not necessary. The concept of necessity would cast its shadow ahead... if we didn't know that human behaviour creates this antinomy: Man knows what is and forgets to be. And that's why I say with you: Long live Longuevie. Long live the future. Who said I should be at the cemetery? The old man. - He can walk. Aren't you ashamed you're still alive? Oh, my ass. My ass. - What's with his ass? Help, help. A murderer. I'm a silly old man, right? Save me, save me. - Hold her tight, Toine. She won't turn around. Don't shoot. Save me. The son disarmed the father. Peasants. Our readers aren't interested in them. Look, Stella fainted. Stella. Are they talking about her? - Not since months. Did she find happiness? Then she's no longer interesting. But she'll get a divorce. - Good. That's during the shooting. - Not enough cleavage. That's before the cleavage. - Too much cleavage. That's the perpetrator. - Who did he kill? Nobody. - Skip it. And the rescuer. We can't print that face. - See how she looks at him. The star and the shepherd. - That's new. Makes a change from a princess. - Toine, a French farmer. Is his name Toine? - Toine Dumont. And Stella's husband's called Tony. Tony. Toine. 'Will Toine replace Tony?' That doesn't sound bad. 'Will Toine replace Tony?' Great. A great find. It would make a good cover. Look at this, gentlemen. Hello? Connect me to Cabosse. Toine. Good friend. Remember: You're from the countryside, where the air is pure... and where people live the longest. I don't need to introduce him. Our good French farmer... from the town where people live the longest. It has been proven. Right? Yes. I'd like to know what Mr Toine really feels for Stella. This will be the world centre of longevity. Longuevie has it all: Flexible payment terms... golf, hotels, casino, theatre... a spa, a fountain of youth. And fresh air. That marvellous air in which you live long. Right, Toine? Of course. Did Mr Toine admire Stella as an artist... before he got to know her personally? - Later. Mr Toine is in Paris for the first time. You'll see that it's not the beauty of the city that astonished him... but the lack of oxygen. The polluted air, the fumes, the smoke. That's why Longuevie is good for the general well-being. Right, Toine? That's absolutely true. What do you think? - You who are used to fresh air. Is the air better here? No, it's not. This is high enough. - Nothing like the air from home. What do you say, Toine? Our air is very pure and you get very old. We want to interview him. - Ask questions. Did Stella call you Antoine or Toine? No questions about his private life. Would your father have killed Stella if you hadn't intervened? Answer. No, she would have gotten some lead shot in her butt. Don't write that down. - We're talking about a great artist. Et cetera, et cetera. Are there any questions? - Have you known Toine for long? I understood him from the start. What attracts you to him? He's the purest being I've ever met. Does he call you Madame or Stella? - That's an indiscrete question. He's a dedicated friend to me, a real buddy. Keep it decent. I'm married, after all. What does your husband think of that shepherd? My husband's my best friend. Poor Tony. He's a pure being as well. Maybe too pure. Bastard. - Bitch. Did you say bitch? Finally. That was it. Bravo, Tony, that was very touching. No, no journalists. I'm not saying anything. Stella's my wife. No questions about our private life. Can you repeat that? - No questions about our private life. Don't take pictures here. Not in a men's clothing shop. I said no. Oh Stella, the way you said that... One more time: I said no. I said no. - Perfect. Couldn't be better. And now the tie she picked for him. Turn around, Toine. Look at your tie. Thank you. And now the entire suit. Quickly, please. Mr Toine. - No, not like that. Attention. Toine, your arm around the neck. No, not around your own neck. Yes. And now smile. Smile, Toine. DID THE SHEPHERD SEDUCE STELLA? I understand you seek publicity for the land you're selling. And involving my wife's one thing. But to damage my reputation... Come on, Tony, you knew. But I didn't know my picture would be smaller than Stella's. Nobody talks about me. - That's up to the papers. All the attention goes to that village idiot. That... what's his name again? - Toine. Hello, dear man. He has a good face. My compliments. If I ever need publicity again... Really, from tomorrow on... That's Stella's husband. - Is she married? Don't you read the papers? But that's not true at all. - Truth is relative. But what's her poor husband going to think? As long as they talk about him. Isn't that woman ashamed? - No, she enjoys the attention. And the readers? - They love it. It's about their beloved stars. - But it's not true. What does that matter? - Everybody's happy. Well, I'm not. You've never left your own town. You're a peasant. In Paris, this is very normal. You have to grab the idiots' attention. - And there's a lot of them. Look. No, I'm in a hurry. Who loves me, follows me. Bravo, dear Stella. Bravo. Look at the sweet children. What do you want, dear? - I want to give you a kiss. I can see that our little girls love you as much as the audience. But tell us. Who's the big love of your life? Your big love is... My little boy. I bet he's clapping now. - He's only 4 months old. He can stay up tonight to clap for mommy, right little one? Blow him a kiss. I'm sure he blew you one back. Thanks, dear Stella. And now our guest of honour. The most famous shepherd of France. Dear Toine, we know that up there in the mountains... you sing songs to your sheep. Sing one of those songs to this lamb to remind it of its home land. Orchestra, please help him. Hey, Mathieu! We're watching your son. DID THE SHEPHERD SEDUCE STELLA? Bravo, Toine. Your friends at home have seen you. And you're about to see them too. Dear viewers, we'll now go to the town of Cabosse. Cabosse here. Mayor, what do you think of your friend Toine? He's not a bad guy. That's why all of Paris now loves him. Stand up and say your name. - My name's Rose. And, Rose, do you know Toine? - I sure do. Say hello to him. Hello, Toine. Say hello to Rose, Toine. Well, Toine? He's not a big talker. - Doesn't he talk to you either? He only talks when he's alone. Only then and not to Rose? Pretend you're alone with your sheep. You're making him insecure, Rose. Come on, Toine. Hello, Rose. - The silence has been broken. Won't you come see us anymore? - I don't know. No? Well, I do. - Who said that? Join us, sir. Who are you? - Toine's father. A reunion of father and son, thanks to television. A real family affair. A hand for Toine's father. Say hello to your beloved father, Toine. We're not on speaking terms. - You're not? I want to say something. You're the first Dumont who's in the newspaper with thieves and murderers. Aren't you ashamed? - You clearly never left your town, dad. You're a peasant. So listen well. Madame Stella and her husband want people to talk about them. In Paris, everyone finds that normal. No, let me explain. It's also publicity for the land Mr Hardy wants to sell. He says it's all about getting the attention of the idiots. If Mr Hardy says that, he's a piece of scum. Tell him I'll kick him up his... Ladies and gentlemen, apologies for this unforeseen incident. PAUSE To say that I want to be gossiped about. In front of my audience. Take him away. I don't want to see him again. Go to your sheep. They're less stupid than you. Quick, to the station. He won't stay here another hour. Get in. We've seen enough of you That doesn't belong to you, Mathieu. Don't touch it. Is it not my land either? - Didn't you want to sell it? I'm still the boss here. You're not listening to me? Do your duty. I arrest you in the name of the law. - I know the law too. The first time I'll shoot in the air and the second time... I'll teach you whose land this is. It belongs to my family. And I'll get rid of your notice board. Cooperate, damnit. Who's the boss here? The mayor? The police? No, I'm the boss. I'm the boss. You'll do as I say. Mathieu, where are you? - Mathieu Dumont. Answer the phone. - What's wrong? You won't believe it. It's providence. Hello? Yes, it's me. Good morning, mayor. What? That's terrible. Poor Mr Dumont. Are you sure? The poor man. Yes, we're all mere mortals. Pass our condolences on to his son. We're going. How unexpected. Toine inherits everything and we know him. It's a done deal. - Let's go there. Good afternoon. Still the prettiest one, Rose? That's how he is. - Now, the orphan can marry you. It's the day of the funeral. - Wedding or funeral. Party time. Never lose faith, Toine. Look at me. That's true. Look at us. Your dad would say: Enjoy the food. - And the drinks. He liked a drink. - To his health then. He was a good bastard. Because he was quite a bastard. When he'd hit me, he'd always say: 'This will make your head just as hard as mine.' And he had a very hard head, poor dad. It's now or never. - We have to finish this. His house. His poor house. His house. - His poor house. That was his bed. His bed. - His poor bed. His kitchen. His poor kitchen. He made his own soup. And it was good, his poor soup. Don't get all down. Come on, sit at the table. - His poor table. Toine, we can't go back in time. Don't look back. - Think of the future. Your father forgot a little formality. Sign here. Poor dad didn't like to write. - So all's well that ends well. You replace him now. - Did he have to put his name there? He wasn't given the time to do it. This was all his. - And now it's yours. You can do with it as you please. - To sell dad's house. Do I have the right? - Of course. It's all yours. It's all mine. Even his gun. His poor gun. His poor gun, his poor hat. His poor pipe, his poor tobacco, his poor shoes. Don't get worked up, boss. - I've had it. That's how he is. No control over his emotions. What's wrong? - My poor head. What did he say? - My poor head. Did the doctor come? - He can't make it. Why? - Too much to drink. But what did he say? - He said: My poor head. I don't care about his head. What did he say about him? To let him sleep. - No way. Do you hear me, Toine? - Yes. Do you recognize me? - Yes. Yes, dad. What's he saying? - Where would I be without a house. He'd buy another one. What's he saying? - That he'd rather stay here. He has to accept the facts. Dad doesn't want me to sell. - Dad has no say about anything anymore. But your dad agreed. If only he could talk. Come in. I'm feeling a bit better. Who is it? Who's there? Hey. Hey. - What is it? Do you hear that? - Hear what? Listen carefully. I don't hear anything. - Me neither. Someone's calling me. - You're dreaming. And that? - What? Didn't you hear that? - No, did you? But there's really someone there. Who's there? - It's me. Which me? - Mathieu, your father. I thought he wanted to hit me. Who? - Dad. You're still drunk. - Go to sleep. Do you hear me, Toine? You have to listen to me. This is your father speaking. - Now you heard it too. Go to sleep. - But he's talking to me. We're off. - See you tomorrow. No, don't leave. You have to leave the house, Toine. I'll sleep here. If you start wandering through the house, you won't find me. I'll get you. Say 'Toine, Toine' if you must. Toine. Toine. Did I wake you up? - I wasn't asleep. You must be tired then. You didn't really sleep last night. Poor Toine, you can be so stupid sometimes. Are you here to laugh at me? I came to see you because everyone's wondering... why you're not selling the house. They ask me, but I don't know. I'll tell you. - I won't tell anyone else. No one? When you look at me, I can't talk. Do I have to hide? Now you don't see me anymore. - I'll try. Well? I'm waiting. - Don't insist. I'm listening. Look, Rose... Good God, good God. - Is that all? It's not easy, you know. I was never much of a talker. Some other time then? I have to find the words. - Look for them. There's plenty of time. There is, but still... Did you see the house, by the way? If you like it, I won't sell it. I'll keep it. For you. If you say no, they can have it. Then I'll leave. But if you say yes, then... What more do I have to say? I won't repeat it all. What's your answer, Rose? What's your answer? Did you hear what I said? I can't hear you. The house on your left belongs to Mr Dumont. That's where the shepherd lives. The seducer the newspapers are full of. 'What's the secret of that Don Juan... whose innocent looks hide his power over the ladies?' Mr Dumont, can I take a picture? - A signature, Toine? Find the woman... - And you'll find him. He was running after her. Our Toine's in love. Very nice... - He wants to marry. And then... - He'll live like daddy. And he'll keep the house. - For his offspring. And the girl? - She's like all women. They marry the first man who courts them. So? - What? Court her. - Who? You. Then it'll be alright. - But I don't want to marry. You don't have to. As long as Toine doesn't marry. You're kidding. - Play your role. The car, Jules. I'd rather be in your shoes. Good luck. What got into you, Toine? - Nothing. Yes? He didn't speak to her for three days? Good. He seems sad? Very good. He doesn't go to the bar anymore? Toine's not seeing Rose anymore. I'll explain later. And? Now we have to grab our chance. The notary says it will work. - A certain sale. When he'll see all the money tomorrow... I bet you've never seen this much money. Just sign. - And then it's yours, lucky devil. Do you know what my grandfather always used to say? That good health is worth more than all the gold in the world. He didn't say 'all the money in the world '. He said 'all the gold in the world'. I get it. You could have asked that earlier. But I'm not asking anything. There. All solved. How are you, Toine? - Not bad. Now everyone can see I'm carrying gold. So what? - You won't be killed for it. Just leave it here. Here? - Yes, here. You can put anything you want in here. We lock the safe-deposit box and give you the key. Is there only one copy? - Of course. What if I lose it? - We'll make a new one. That means he can open it whenever he wants. And you can't steal a house. So if you don't mind, I'll keep it a bit longer. They've waited long enough. - So they can wait another minute. One minute, I said. Hello, Rose. Hello, Toine. Are you getting married? - To whom? To that man who always walks with you. Poor Toine, in Paris all the girls walk with boys. That doesn't mean they'll get married. I couldn't live in Paris. You could. If I'd marry a Parisian. Of course. But I don't intend to. So you'd rather stay here? Yes, if I marry someone from here. I've been stupid. - You were always stupid, poor Toine. Are you coming, Toine? - Yes, I'm coming. Do you want happiness and prosperity? Well, there's a generous man here... who wants to make you happy. This man's discouraged. He wants to abandon his project. And why? Because one of you... One of you wants to keep the fountain of youth for himself. It's on the side of the road. Anyone can drink from it. We want to exploit the spring commercially. I want to stay in my house. Isn't that my right? You heard the town's voice. The way you heard your father's voice. My father? Everybody can speak on his behalf now. Sorry, Mr Hardy, but when he was still alive, he said... 'Mr Hardy's a piece of scum.' Mr Dumont, you're an enemy of the people. Enemy of the people. I can stay where I am, can't I? - Are you talking to me? You're all the same. Where's Rose? She's gone for a walk. - Again? With whom? With anyone she wants. - Alright, I'll wait. A glass of white. - I ran out. A glass of red then. - I also ran out of that. What's this? - I don't serve hotheads. You don't have the right. - But you have the right to ruin things? It should be full of construction workers here. And people from Paris. Enemy of the people. - What? Help, a murderer. Help. Dad, Toine Dumont's making a scene. Come quickly, dad. Toine, listen. - I don't listen to anyone anymore. My kepi. I've known your grandfather and the father of your grandfather. Toine Dumont. In the name of the law... Tell me, Rose. Does Toine want to marry you? He never says anything. - You're handling it wrong. You have to make him jealous. Do as I say. You'll see... Rose. I want to see Rose. - She's not here. He'll ask you within five minutes. - Are you sure? You saw him run. I told you she's not here. What are you doing here, Toine? Were you looking for me? Did you want to see me? Make up your mind. - No need for words. Here. I'm not as stupid as you think. I'm on to you and to all of you. The house, the land, you can have it. I don't want it anymore. Go tell your boss. And hurry up. 'Scum.' -Forget about that. Relax a bit. Good health... is worth more than all the gold in the world. What do I get if I save you? - It can't be expressed in money. The house and the land are yours. How much do I get? Whatever you want. - You're a witness. Don't break your promise. - We're saved. An unexpected development. - Is he dead? No, he's selling. He agrees. My job's done. My money? Where is he? - Next door. Hurry up then. The paperwork. Dad, Toine's in front of the bar. - Don't let him leave. I'm coming. Come into my arms. - I don't want to. All together: Long live Toine Dumont. - Long live Toine Dumont. Bunch of bastards. - Long live Toine. Get lost. I'm going to my sheep. Not right now. - Sign first. Come on, let me sign. Let's get it over and done with. I'm coming. I'm coming. - Dad, it's that way. The paperwork. - The paperwork. You're holding it. - Yes, here it is. A pen. - A pen. Here. - Here. Do I sign there? - One moment. Friends, a historical moment. - Please... Not now. - I'll keep it short. Only one signature stands between us and the birth of Longuevie. Long live Dumont, long live Longuevie. - Thanks, Mayor. Sign. Antoine Dumont. I knew your grandfather and the father of your grandfather. Leave him. It's all arranged. Silence. I'm the law. You're a danger to society. What did I do now? - No idea. But you're pigheaded, like your dad and you'll end like your brother. His brother? He has a brother? - So what? He's not the only heir. His brother died a long time ago. His brother's dead. - Good, he's dead. Bravo. That's better. - He still has to sign. You didn't sign. - I can't. Because of my brother. I forgot about him. But he's dead. We only said that because we were ashamed. He may not be that dead. Where is your brother then? Where is he? HOUSE OF DETENTION Your brother was a good guy. He was pigheaded, but he had a heart of gold. I always get emotional when I enter his cell. That's all that's left of him. Didn't you know? - No. When did it happen? - Seven years ago by now. We looked after him well, but one day he got depressed. He bent the bars and left. How do we find out where he is? We know. He wrote to us. Come here. Pierrot. Look at what he sent my little boy. A costume of the place where he lives. Dumont! - Martial Dumont! Hello? Martial Dumont? We were disconnected. Here's your brother. Keep it short. As I was saying. What time is it there? Talk about the contract. Sheep? Yes, we still have them. And you? La... llamas? Nice. What are llamas? A llama is a type of goat with a long neck. Or a type of little camel. Can you imagine? No? Please stick to our case. We haven't talked for ten years. We have to catch up. No, I won't come back. I got married here. Are you married? No? That's not good. A Dumont has to marry. The family can't die out. Make sure you marry. What's it to you? I do what I want and I don't follow orders. What kind of pig? No, you're pigheaded. Just like dad. He agrees. - Who? Martial. He gives everything to Toine, provided he gets married. Now Toine wants to sell. If he gets married he might not. But we have Rose. We'll talk to Rose. Who? - Don't you remember? Rose. To whom he doesn't talk anymore. We'll make sure they get married. Antoine Dumont? Never. Then you can leave. - I'd love to. And where will you be going? Doesn't matter. To Paris or somewhere else. As if life's simple there. - You told me it was. But a good marriage to a serious guy... Do you mean Toine? - Yes, why not? You said he's not exactly handsome. - If you look at him well... He hits women. I won't take that. A vindictive woman. But people hurt those that they love. Sometimes people hurt those they don't love. Never. Isn't there a girl you like? Yes, one. - Don't leave then. I never want to see her again. - Listen. If you mention her name, I'll shoot. If you see Toine Dumont, report at Town Hall. But be careful. The man is armed. Spread the word. Talk to him. - Give us a chance. I don't have anything to say to him. - He loves you. How do you know? - Everybody knows. And you had to court her? - You told me to. You shouldn't have listened to me. - Look. He can't escape. - He has to surrender. Once he sees her... - We'll be saved. Don't go back. Keep going. They're losing courage. - No, Rose keeps going. She's walking towards him. - Bravo, Rose. Go, girl. - He's saying something. I won't get married. - Me neither. Then we're even. - Not yet. I'm not listening. - You don't have to. She's betraying us. She's leaving. Him too. Come back. Attack each other or something, but do get married. One thing: I don't love you. - I don't love you either. Why do you tell people you do? How do you know? - Everybody says so, except you. What if I had told you? - Tell me and you'll know. What are they doing? - Just say: I love you. You love me. You talk to sheep. - They're good animals. What do you say to them? - None of your business. That you want to get married? - Maybe. Did you also tell them to whom you want to get married? That's none of their business. It's going well. Very well. - Kiss each other. That'll settle it. Think of me, please. I can't take it anymore. All the money we can make. How do I know if you don't say anything? - What? What you're telling people. - But you know. You didn't tell me. What should I say? You should say: Rose, I've loved you for a long time. You're the most beautiful girl in town and the most sensible one. We'll get married. And we'll go far away together. Will you say it or not? I don't need to. You already said it for me. Friends, in name of the town... - No, let me say something now. Friends, it was a serious battle. But now nothing stops me from creating Longuevie... in this beautiful landscape with its pure air... where people get so old. The fountain's near the road. Anyone can drink from it.
