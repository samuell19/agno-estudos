I'm usually out all night anyway. - You shouldn't mention we spoke. - I wouldn't do that. I never kiss and tell. (engine revs) See ya. (birds chirp) (suspenseful electronic music) - Cool it, Jack. - Diller, what the is this? - Tell me, man. - You man. - If you want me to, I'd love to go that far. You want to? You're up for murder one, my friend. - You're crazy. - Your car was found at the scene, the place was covered with your prints. What the going on? - Diller, I wouldn't give you the time of day. - Oh really? (slap smacks) I'm still in there. Unlike you, now what the is going on? What's your time worth, Jack? Hm? I know you're not a killer. But unless you talk, I'm gonna have you tied up with this for months. You go ahead and think about it, it makes no difference to me. Murder one, hey. I personally know that Money Marty wouldn't give up five cents bail for you. You'll be stuck in there, no income, nothing. Lawyer fees. We got enough on you, man. You think about it on your way to the car. - All right, all right, all right, all right.

On that's all right, let him go, let him go. - Why don't you guys just tell me what's going on, huh? I know if you're involved, it's gotta be financially profitable. - Why don't you help us out? - The guy's name is Fromin. - Fromin. - Builds hotels or somethin'. - So what's your idea? He do it? - He says he has an alibi. I think he hired me to be his alibi. - [Investigator] Do you know this guy? - Yeah, I knew him. We're on top of this, Jack. I want you to stay clear of our investigation. Or I will push this murder charge. Let's get outta here. (birds chirp) - What the now Diller, eh? What's the catch, man? Where's the bread? (suspenseful electronic music) - [Man] You got it? - I shouldn't be giving you. - There's only half here. - Hey, you're lucky to get that. - I figured that-- - I made you and I can break you. You. - It was a slight change of plans. - Well, this reflects your slight change of plans. What was the PI doing there, anyway? - Fromin had to cover his. - [Henchman] Tracy's doing Chris? - Look, what do you want me to tell you, anyway? - If this gets any more, end of game.

You feel like talkin'? - Hey, hey, we're just security for the site. - [Man] Shut up, Rick. - Why don't you shut up, I'm talkin' to your buddy over here. Come on, you wanna tell me something? - We were hired by the developers to keep like you off the property. - Oh, you are, are you? Well you're doin' a great job, man. (slaps smack) A wonderful job. (man groans) I'm sorry, did I step on that again? Listen. You buys should find those by nightfall. Is Fromin the developer? Jim Fromin, does that name ring a bell? - [Rick] I don't know nothin'. - Well you guy are some back kickers, I'll tell you that. (gentle instrumental music) - Nice. - What do you want? - [Lori] I can't believe Chris died. - Lori, I really need to be alone now. - You were sleeping with him? - Lori, please. - You were sleeping with my trustee. How long had this been going on? Since before dad died? - Do you ever think of anyone but yourself? Or is that just the way it is? - I think of you sometimes, you and Dad. I think you made him happy after Mom died. You were okay for him at the end, I guess. How many of those have you taken? - Some. - Enough to kill yourself? - No. Now please leave. (birds chirp) - What's going on? - Tracy's sleeping. - How is she? - She seems pretty out of it. - You guys talked. - We do talk occasionally. - Don't give me any Lori, please, just once. - Yeah, whatever. - You know, you don't give me much of a chance to talk to you.

Well, I should have money. - No. No. - I knew who Chris Sterner was. (suspenseful music) - [Jack] Yeah? - He was my trustee. He invested my inheritance money. Well, my dad died a couple of years ago, Tracy thought she was gonna get everything. But in the end, she only ended up with an interest in the hotels he was developing. The rest went into my trust. - So Chris Sterner's your trustee and Tracy starts having an affair with him? - Tacky, isn't it? So now I'm terrified. I wanna hire you. Chris was putting a lot of money into the hotel development, and it's a mess. - Is there anybody else involved? - Fromin's talking for Tracy, and they have a partner, Keller. They seem to talk on the phone a lot. There's a lot of money at stake here.

I'm pretty good at that sort of thing. - Yeah, maybe. (suspenseful electronic music) Look, uh, Lori has a trust left to her by her real father. - Yeah? - I mean we're talkin' substantial amounts here. 50 to 70 million dollars. - Where's the hitch? - Tracy was left with the house, part of a hotel development, and some real bills. - Who killed Chris Sterner, Mr. Fromin? - I know this seems complicated. We needed the cash to live on until the hotels were finished. - Lori's trust? - Yeah. Tracy should've gotten half of it if it wasn't for that real chincy prenuptial that she was forced to sign. - Would've been easy street for you, eh? - I love Tracy, I was never into her for her money. She never had any anyway. - [Jack] Okay, so you've embezzled some. - Yeah. A little, but now it's out of control. We stopped a long time ago, but we got this partner, Nolan. - Keller? - Yeah. Technically Lori's father's old partner, you know, sort of a business associate. - Yeah, I'm with you. - He's garbage. I mean, when we started, it was great, no big problem. We paid some bills. - How much were those bills? - We got almost two million, but that was it. We weren't greedy, and now that's almost gone. - Well, so far, we've got murder, we've got fraud-- - We didn't have anything to do with that murder. - Well then why don't you just call the cops and you people can handle this thing in court? - We can't do that. There's a cop who's been extorting us. - Lieutenant Diller. - It's out of the authorities' hands. - It's not true. - It is true. - What's going on out there at those hotels? - Money comes and construction starts. But the paper shuffling, the double billing, and the phony loans, we were able to siphon off a lot of cash. Construction never got very far. We wanted Keller to stop, but he just kept going and now we can't stop him. He's turned a 20 million project into a 50 million one with all the overruns going directly to him. - He's strong arming us. We don't have anywhere to turn. - So why don't you just call the cops, let the chips fall where they will, and Diller's gonna get his. - I can't do that. I'm not going to jail. - I see. So uh, Keller had Chris Sterner killed. - We're both pretty scared now. - [Jack] What's your big plan there, Mr. Fromin? - I got a gun, I can handle things. - That's it. (gun fires) - No!

It's a front for an unbelievable banking scam. - [Ash] Jack, that doesn't sound right, are you sure? - Yeah, it's murder, cover-ups, the works. - [Ash] No, I remember now. They had some bogus inspection. It was all straightened out. - No, no, no, it's all a scam, man. Diller's in on it. - [Ash] Are you on Diller again? Last time you almost got me the libel suit.

We're going to wait for Keller. I'm going to the airport to pick him up right now. Go out and look for that PI. I want that son of a back here or dead before Keller gets here. - [Henchman] I still don't get this. - It's not for you to get, okay? I'll take out Keller. Just do what I tell you. (suspenseful electronic music) This road has been cleared all the way to the ranch. There wasn't a lot of debris up here. - That's good. (birds chirp) (hood clatters) (suspenseful electronic music) Anita, when is dinner? - I'll serve it right now if you wish, sir. - Yeah, now'd be very good. I can't eat that airplane crap. How are things here? - All right.

Get 'em outta here. - What is this? - You should be thanking us. - You're gone for months, you come waltzing in here. - You okay? - [Lori] Yeah. - You're lucky to be alive. It's over, Mr. Fromin. Everything's gonna be okay. - What is this? - You work too hard, Jack. You really work too hard. - What Gary? Car? Name? No no, slow down, slow down, hang on. Anyway, go ahead. 13, 62, El Dorado. Yeah. Is he big? It's a question. Yeah, because if he's big, forget it. Five four. Yeah, yeah, is that off his driver's license? All right, all right, okay I believe you, go ahead. All right. All right, I'll have something for you later in the week. I heard you, I heard you, okay. All right, bye. - What's happening? - Nothing. - If I get any calls, let me know, I'll be upstairs. - Okay. Okay. (birds chirp) - Hey Lori. I just checked again to see if there's any way to track those embezzled funds. Looks pretty hopeless. Keller was a very thorough man. Sounds like easy come, easy go, huh? Listen, I'm gettin' ready to leave, but you can give me a call at 555-8964. - Oh. Jesus. (machine beeps) - [Jack] But you can give me a call at 555-8954. - [Man] Yeah, I'm calling from Lionel's repair. Your VCR is ready. - [Woman] Lori, if you're checking messages, please make sure you don't rewind the tape. Please don't rewind the tape, okay? (machine beeps) - [Fromin] I have the funds secured, Diller. - [Diller] Don't with me, Fromin. - All right, Diller, whatever you want. Once things have cooled down, we'll make the trip abroad. (dial tone hums) (buttons click) - Jack. - Hey, what's up. - [Lori] Diller and Fromin. They framed Keller, they have the funds. (man groans) No! (phone thuds) - You know, I thought I took care of everything, but there's always something. - [Lori] (sobs) No! - [Operator] Has been exceeded. (Lori and Fromin groan) Please hang up and try your call again. (suspenseful electronic music) (Lori groans) (engine revs) (gun fires) (engine revs) - [Lori] Oh, no! (engine revs) - [Fromin] Bitch! Diller, get your over here, I need your help now! - [Diller] Calm down, Fromin, I'll be right there. (Fromin pants) (engine revs) (Lori gasps) (gun clicks) (kick thuds) - No!
