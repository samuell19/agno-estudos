There are some fundamental truths of which we are reminded when an extraordinary event comes to pass, that the desire to make an ideal contribution resides in every human heart, that it is neither racial nor political, that winning is a great accomplishment, but a courageous effort can be an even greater reward, that a small number of young and determined athletes can sometimes silence the world's chaos, if only for a moment, that in spite of any protests or differences, the Olympics is capable of touching some greatness in everyone, something that could mean a turning point in all of us. On a mild winter night in January, 1984, the olympic flame arrives in Dubrovnik lo begin a week-long journey through Yugoslavia. On the course is competitor number 16, didier bouvet, France. How do you feel? Give us some kind of a sense of your experience right now. I don't know. This doesn't feel much different than a world cup on the circuit. But I think it'll sink in tonight, maybe, when I stand on the victory platform. It could be a turning point because of the... As soon as you say the word ?olympic,? uh, it seems that it is magic. Even in the deepest days of winter, the coast of Yugoslavia is temperate. And so it is somehow incongruous that here is where the flame of the 14th winter olympic games will begin its journey through Yugoslavia. And on the morning that the flame arrives, people awaken at unaccustomed hours fo line the streets in every direction. Even in the faces of those too young to apprehend it, there is the sense that something rare and wonderful is passing through their lives. Sarajevo, a city of a half a million people in the mountains of central Yugoslavia. /ts mosques and churches, village shops and cobblestone streets speak of the city's rich past. But in other parts of the city, another story is told. Skyscrapers and office buildings, luxury apartment awellings, moaern highways, fashionable shopping centers and university surroundings create a cily that is alive with possibilities. On every corner of this magnificent cily, olympic fever is in the air. As runners carry the flame through Yugoslavia's cities and towns, Sarajevo is brimming with last-minute preparations. Directors give final instructions, and choir groups gather nervously in adress rehearsal for the Olympics cultural events. Even as the forch moves closer fo Sarajevo, so are the athletes arriving, each filled with his own thoughts of what the games will bring and how their lives will change. These are the inheritors of olympic glory, the links fo past and future. They will show their finest talents in the spirit of fair play. February 8, 1964. The flame arrives in Sarajevo. For many, a plan that has been in the making for over four years is about to unfold. Thousands of Yugoslavia's residents in colorful high-tech couture enter the stadium for opening ceremonies. Crowds line up shortly past dawn, though all hold tickets and ceremonies won't begin for hours. Finally, only moments after two o clock, in a celebration that is vast and grand, colorful and diverse as the world itself, the olympic games begin. 50,000 spectators, 15,000 athletes, 49 nations together in peace. On behalf of international olympic committee... I should like to thank the organizers and the people of Yugoslavia for the great efforts they have made in organizing this 14th olympic winter games here in Sarajevo. The Republic of Yugoslavia proclaim the 14th olympic winter games open. Thousands of feet above kosevo stadium, training for the men's downhill is nearing a close. The event is scheduled for tomorrow, the first day of the games. Bad weather has caused frustration and delays, but at least three racers seem unmoved by the complications. Bill Johnson, one month earlier, became the first American to win an official world cup downhill. Switzerland's Peter mdiller is a two-time world cup champion. And Austria's Franz klammer is 1976's downhill gold medalist and current world cup champion. Psychologically, this final training run is key. At 30 years old, Franz klammer is the sentimental favorite. He came back from a long slump fo capture the '83 world cup crown. This is his last Olympics, and he hasn't come fo lose. Twenty-three-year-old Billy Johnson has finished second or better in four of his five training runs. In an interview, he told reporters, 'forget top three. I'm going to win.? Peter Miller has a score fo settle. One year ago, he crashed auring a training run on this course. He sustained a concussion and knee injuries that cost him his chance for the world cup fitle. But the injuries seemed to heighten his desire fo win. For Peter Miller, this downhill is a final chapter. As the week drew fo a close, klammer raced consistently. Bill Johnson continued to boast and ski with equal ability. But Peter Miller had heard all that before. Throughout the Olympics, Sarajevo pays homage to the theme of art and sports. Thursday, February 9. A sform has moved in overnight, causing more frustration as the men's downhill is canceled. Bill Johnson responds with typical elan. The delay is really no big deal. I had to deal with delays already this year at wengen. You just got to keep the same attitude for the next day. You know, it's - you gotta take what you get. It's no big deal, really. At Igman, site of the nordic events, the women's ten-kilometer cross-country race is scheduled to begin at nine o clock. Finland's marja-liisa hamadldinen has competed for ten years and two Olympics, but both individual olympic and world championship medals have eluded her Raisa Smetanina of the Soviet Union is the 1976 gold medalist in the 10k. She will try fo repeat that performance here. While the 10k continues in the mountains, the women's 1,500-meter speed skating event is going on at zetra. Andrea schone of East Germany is among the favorites in this event, but the competition is keen all around. Her best effort brings a silver medal. Natalya Petruseva of the Soviet Union is a former world record holder in the 1,500-meter distance. Her career has been an enviable one. But today she must settle for the bronze. Back at Igman, Brit Pettersen of Norway, H?m?ldinen's longtime rival, closes in on the field and strides through the finish to claim third place. But it is mana-liisa hamalainen who wins the first gold meaal of the games. It is an exhausting but joyful victory for this woman, who has persevered despite years of personal frustration and professional disappointments. Cheered on by the Soviet crowd, raisa smetanina completes the race in second place, less than a second off the winning time. But for now, the moment belongs to Finland and to Marja-Lilsa Hama?ldinen for her great and memorable effort. As the 10k enas, Karin Enke of East Germany completes the last lap of the 1,500-mefter race. Enke, who wanted to become a figure skater, but was told she was too tall, wins her first gold medal and sets a new world record. Come on, let's go. That night, inside Zetra, the American hockey team faced off against Czechoslovakia. Let's go get 'em tonight. Come on. The Americans had been defeated in a previous game against Canada, but hopes still ran high that the miracle of 1980 could be repeated. Hey, hey, usa! Hey, hey, usa! Hey, hey, usa! The Americans played a fast, aggressive, scrappy style of hockey, but the more experienced Czech team thwarted them at every turn. - Let's shoot the puck! - Hey, Joe, get it! Despite a brief rally, the magic of 1980 seemed fo have run ifs course. Perhaps the burden of expectation was too great. By the end of the last period, any previous hopes for medals or greatness seemed completely faded. Behind the scenes at every Olympics, there is an organizational machine almost incomprehensible in scope and responsibility, for it is the goal of the games fo be a truly global event capable of reaching and touching the lives of millions of people in every nation around the world. The achievement of this goal is a challenge of infinite proportions, and yet somehow, fo the Sarajevo olympic organizing committee, even the most difficult task was nema problema. It was also no problem on any given night to fill the house for one of the Olympics many beautiful and festive cultural events. The storm continues in the mountains, and the men's downhill is again postponed. The course has supposedly been really blown apart at the top and some of the nets are gone. Right now we're sort of in a place where we don't really know what's happening. Nobody knows when we're gonna run for sure or how it's gonna work. So you can't really get into it, but you can't pull yourself back. It's a hard place to be. There is 16 inches of fresh snow and 30-miles-per-hour winas at the start of the men's 30k. In distance events such as this, it is the older and more experienced athletes who are favored to win. But Finland's 22-year-old gunde svan could prove the exception. Soviet Aleksandr Zavyalov is ranked at the top of the field. But even he will need an extraordinary performance fo defeat his teammate, number 72, Nikolai Zimyatov, 1980's double gold meaalist. Zavyalov reaches the finish in second place and claims the first olympic medal of his career. And Gunde Svan, possessed with unusual courage and purpose, breaks the veterans' stronghold in an impressive and punishing bronze medaal finish. But it is the powerful and experienced Nikolai Zimyatov who eclipses the others fo earn the gold in this grueling event. Back in town, the storm has taken its toll at Zetra and the men's 500-mefter speed skating event is delayed while the track is cleared. Canada is resting its hopes in this event on ga?tan boucher like Eric Heiden, boucher is an all-around skater who competes in both sprint and distance races. Competition is stiff from both Soviet and Japanese skaters. But boucher does not disappoint. He takes the bronze, his first medal of the games, and can now look ahead with confidence fo the 1,500 and 3, 000-meter events. The winter olympic games began in 1924. In sarafevo's olympic museum, six decades of olympic artifacts commemorate the history and tradition, the art and the times that became the foundation of the games today. Saturday, February 11. Unbelievably, the storm continues to rage. But at Igman, the 20-kilometer biathlon proceeds as planned. Even here though, the storm is complicating an already difficult event in which skiing and marksmanship weigh equally in the balance. Peter angerer of west Germany prevails over bitter winds and heavy competition fo win the gola, his first of three medals in the games. After the 20k biathlon, focus shifts fo Trebevic, site of the bobsled competition. After three runs, the Russians and East Germans emerged in the lead with the number one and two sleds from both countries jockeying for the best time. Going into the fourth and final run, East Germany's number-two sled was winning. But the Soviets, with their new, controversial bullet-style sleds, were still a threat Ekmanis and Aleksandrov of the Soviet Union need a perfect run for a chance at the meaals. They finish the course in 51.26 seconds lo edge out their teammates for the bronze. Lehmann and Musiol in East Germany's sled number one need to hold on to their advantage. Though they carried good speedq, a few small errors in the turns cost them precious time. They finish the run in 51.36 seconds fo win second place overall. Eins, zwei, are. Hoppe and schauerhammer of East Germany remain. They turn in an incredible, record-breaking run and claim the gold with a commanding lead. That night, when Canada faced off against Finland, it looked like they were on their way fo becoming the new heroes of hockey. They trounced the Finns easily for their third consecutive win in three games. Sunday, February 12. The women's 5k. Marja-liisa hamadldinen told reporters, 'a hundred times the Finnish press said I never would become someboaly. I want to show them I am somebody.? Berit aunli won the 5k in the 1982 world championships and is Norway's best hope for a medal today. Czechoslovakia's kvefoslava jeriova rounds out the competition. But when the race is over, it is ham?ldinen who crosses the finish to win her second gold medal. In the men's 5,000-meter speed skating event, Sweden's Tomas gustafson, world record holder in the 10000 mefer, wins the gold medal. There is number 50, jens weissflog, German Democratic Republic. Jens weissflog, a slight 19-year-old East German, caps off a world cup winning streak with a gold medal in the 70-meter jump. Weissflog's rival is 20-year-old matti nykanen of Finland. Today, nyk?nen settles for the silver, but he will face weissflog again on Saturday in the 90-meter jump. Final runs of the singles in men's and women's luge are under way. East Germany is dominating the women's event. In the men's singles, [Taly and the Soviet Union are battling for the lead. I think the sensation on the run is kind of a high-speed roller coaster on your back. I think the best quote I've ever heard is, ?like riding a bar of soap.? Again, the seemingly unending snowfall creates complications, and the women's luge is delayed. Twenty-one-year-old steffi Martin has finished first in every run so far and has set the pace for an East German sweep. Martin wins her fourth consecutive run. She takes the gold and inspires teammates bettina schmidt and ute weild to the silver and bronze. Attention focuses on the men's final run. Twenty-four-year-old sergey danilin of the Soviet Union has improved his time with each run. He finishes in second place overall. Paul hildgartner of Italy is 32 years old and is competing on a sled of individual construction. Hildgartners career includes two previous olympic medals. Today, he wins his third. In zetra, skaters perform in front of a packed house and a worldwide audience. The usa's Peter and kitty carruthers are tied for second place behind Soviet leaders valova and vasilyev. Soviets seleznyova and makarov are rewarded with the bronze. Valova and vasilyev are next. Their coach explains her approach fo their routines. What makes them so special? It is, uh... Well, I can't praise myself, but I just study the programs of other pairs for many, many years. I look for typical elements, typical movements, typical ideas and composition of the program something special that will differ from these typical things. Valova and vasilyev execute their program virtually without error. All the competition could do was watch and wait and hope they could do belter. Next, kitty and Peter carruthers. The cheers and applause grow steadily for Peter and kitty carruthers, the brother and sister team from the usa. They are rewarded with a standing ovation from the crowd and a silver medal from the judges. The final tally is seleznyova and makarov, the bronze, Peter and kitty carruthers, the silver, and valova and vasilyev, the gold. Monday, February 13. The men's 156k gunde svan is in pursuit of his second gold medal. But this time he is hoping for the gold. In competition for that medal is the formidable Finnish contingent, number 63, aki karvonen, and number 37, harri kirvesniem. Their teammate, juha mieto, will also be a factor. Svan manages fo sustain an early lead despite pressure from the Finns. He crosses the finish and wins the gold. Aki karvonen takes the silver, and harri kirvesniemi takes the bronze. In the women's thousand-meter race, each of the favorites has won at least one medal already. A rivalry has ensued. Andrea sch?ne is the silver medalist in the 1,500-meter race. Natalya petruseva is the Soviet Union's strongest and most experienced all-distance skater. And karin enke, schone's feammate, is a double gold meaalist in the 500 and 1,500-mefter events. Once again, karin enke prevails to win the gold, her third medal of the games. Schone and petruseva take second and third, increasing the rivalry for the 3,000-meter race on Wednesday. Because of the many cancellations, the women's giant slalom is the first alpine event to be held. And for the first time in olympic history, the American team has a shot at the medals. Europe's strongest contenders are French veteran perrine pelen and Swiss giant slalom specialist Erika hess. Christin Cooper, Debbie Armstrong, Tamara mckinney and their stalwart mentor Cindy Nelson form the core of America's hope for medals. At 12:00 noon, the first run begins. Al the end of the first run, christin Cooper holds the lead. Teammate Debbie Armstrong is in second place. Spain's Maria Fernandez ochoa trails closely in third, with perrine pelen in fourth. In the second run, racers ski in reverse oraer of their first-run finish. Perrine pelen must work her way out of fourth place. Her ski slips, causing her to falter, but she recovers quickly. An excellent run on the bottom of the course knocks ochoa out of contention and gives perrine pelen the bronze. Armstrong is next. She is competing against teammate christin Cooper for the gold. I wasn't feeling any pressure or anything, especially after the first run. The next run, all I had to do was go up there and do the same thing again and have fun, and it would come out okay. At the start, I was in the starting gate, and I said to myself, okay, Deb, this is the one, so you gotta do it now. Perry 7hough Armstrong's career has always looked promising, at 21 she has never finished better than third in a giant slalom race. Toaay, Debbie Armstrong skis the race of her life. She crosses the finish with the best time. If it holds, she will win the gold medal. But christin Cooper, the first-run leader, is no stranger to pressure. All eyes turn to Cooper for this deciding run. Cooper has been winning world cup and world championship races since 1982. In 1980, she finished seventh in the lake placid giant slalom. Now she has a chance at the gold. At the tenth gate, Cooper misjudges, and her edges slip out from under her. She finishes half a second behind Armstrong. Asked about her error, she said, ?you could take all the joy out of life by always wanting something to be better.? Cooper, a true athlete, takes pride in her silver. And her friend and teammate Debbie Armstrong rejoices with the gold. Perrine pelen joins Armstrong and Cooper in the winner's circle, and the three give notice to the world that they are now the ones to beat. Ready! This country was one of the beneficiaries - But since then, there has been great progress, and today, you are returning the gift you once received. Al over the world, children are forming impressions of what the Olympics mean. But in every language, the message is the same. Pride, excitement and a desire to partake and identify with a moment the entire world holds as special. Tuesday, February 14. At57 ga?tan bouchers size is against him. So he will need a nearly flawless race lo defeat the Soviet's powerful sergey khlebnikov, who registers the fastest time of the 1,000-meter sprint. Though he has managed a few second-place finishes, boucher has never won an international competition. This Olympics is a last opportunity fo step out from the shadows. Boucher's concentration is unmistakable. He drives though the finish fo beat khlebnikov by 83/100th of a second and wins his first gold medal. Three yugoslavian skiers are favorites in today's giant slalom. But with racers such as Phil mahre, Steve mahre and Andreas wenzel, predictions are withheld until after the first run. Alt the end of the first run, neither mahre seems to be a factor. Instead, Max julen, Andreas wenzel, Franz gruber and jure franko occupy the top four spots. If franko holds on, he could become the first yugoslavian fo win a medal in the winter Olympics. Jure! Jure! The course is hard and has the texture of broomed limestone. Jure franko begins his run. Franko's best finish in a giant slalom has been sixth place. But with the crowds behind him, he skis the course with speed and agility. Jure! Jure! Jure! Jure! Franko wins the silver medal and becomes a national hero. Jure! Jure! Jure! Unmindftul of the celebration is Liechtenstein's Andreas wenzel. Wenzel finishes fractions off jure's time and wins the bronze. Minute 21.171. Max julen remains. On the course is competitor number 12, Max julen, Switzerland. The 22-year-old skier from zermatt Switzerland, has difficulty in the steep upper sections of the course, but at the bottom, he is quick and aggressive. For Max julen, it is a gold medal run. Jure! Jure! Jure! Jure! Jure! But foaay the joy is not for gold, but for national pride and honor. Jure! Jure! Jure franko, boyish and handsome, is swamped with fans, press and television reporters. Everyone wants to know what it is like fo be Yugoslavia's first olympic medalist. Hours after the giant slalom, crowds make their way to zetra for the ice dancing finals. The highlight is a vanguard performance from britain's jayne torvill and Christopher Dean, last of the 19 performers. Torvill and Dean enact a tale of star-crossed lovers destiny has willed to separate forever. Torvill and Dean conclude their passionate story with an equally dramatic finale. The crowds are overwhelmed. The judges' response is unanimous. Perfect scores for artistic expression. Torvill and Dean become the first non-Soviet skaters to win the ice dancing competlition. Soviet pairs, bestemyanova and bukin, klimova and ponomarenko, take second and third. By 9:00 the following morning, the women's 4x5 relay is alreadly in progress. Norway's inger helene nybraten finishes with the best first lap and hands off to teammate Anne jahren. Julia stepanova of the Soviet Union is next to make the handoff Lubov liadova tries to increase her team's lead. The 3,000 meter is the last of the women's speed skating events. Once again, the contest is between two fteammartes, Andrea schone and karin enke. Each has won at least two meaals. Schone finishes with an excellent time. Now she must wait for enke. Norway's Anne jahren is leading near the second lap of the 4x5. She is followed closely by blanka paulu of czechoslovakia. Jahren finishes with the best time of her leg and relays to brit pettersen. Karin enke is completing the last lap of the 3, 000-meter race. This time she cannot improve on schone's speed. Schone fakes the gold, enke takes the silver and teammate gabi sch?nbrunn wins the bronze. Al the 4x5, berit aunli finishes the anchor leg that wins the gold meaal for Norway. Kvetoslava jeriova skis the fastest individual lap to bring the Czech team a silver. Marja-liisa hamaldinen secures the bronze for Finland. Approaching the finishing line. In skenderijja, the Soviet hockey team is facing off against Sweden, but the swedes are helpless against the powerful Russian hockey machine. They are defeated by a final score of 10-1. The Yugoslav people are proud of what they have done so far and what will be taking place on our rugged Bosnian mountains, helping to contribute towards unity and friendship among young people. Just as the dignity of sports wins over political, nationalistic, religious and racial prejudices, true art also has no boundaries or barriers. The works of art shown at this exhibition bear witness to the high achievements and diversity of the artistic vocations of the artists, their artistic preoccupations, searching for and discovering new ways and forms of artistic expression. Thursday, February 16. The women's downhill. The downhill had been canceled aays earlier after the first ten racers had completed their runs. It was a tough call for michela figini. She had been holding the lead. Now figini needed fo make a gold medal run one more time. Switzerland's michela figini wins again. She becomes the youngest alpine racer fo win a gold medal in the Olympics. Figini"s teammate, 21-year-old Maria walliser, won the '83 world cup downhill in Sarajevo. Her training times were among the fastest. Walliser's time is good, but she could not overtake figini, who maintained the gold by a margin. Starting in 16th place, czechoslovakia's Olga charvatova is having an excellent run. She crosses the finish and becomes the first czechoslovakian skier to win an alpine event. An elated charvatova rejoices in the bronze. Maria walliser receives the silver, and the young michela figini informs the world of her gold. After a week of delays, the men's downhill is, at last scheduled fo run. Bill Johnson's boasting... Peter Miller's training times... And Franz klammer's reputation have maae the downhill a media item. For bill Johnson, who is often regarded as a rebel, anything short of a gold will be coming up empty. On the course is competitor number six, William Johnson, United States. In six decades of competition, no American man has ever won an olympic downhill. Johnson is out to change that record. Johnson said, ?this downhill is my kind of course. I just started motoring at the bottom, staying in a good, low position over the bumps.? Johnson registers the fastest time of the race. His predictions no longer seem the empty boasting of youth and inexperience. Man, good job. But there is still one man who could change the score. Peter Miller, two-time world cup champion, is on course. At the first interval, Miller is ahead. Al the second interval, Miller increases his lead. I was a little scared when Pete came down. A big lull in the crowd. I wasn't sure what he had done. You know, the guys that have been coming close all week, you know, were already down. Mdller finishes a heartbeat short of the gold. One year ago, his career nearly ended when he fell on this course. Today, he wins the silver and expresses no regrets. The finish line celebration is subdued only once. Anton steiner, number 13, of Austria is having a very fast run. Steiner crosses the finish line in 1.45.95. He does not better mller or Johnson's time, but he does take the bronze. Do you realize the historic significance of this and everything? Not really. It hasn't come yet. In men's free skating, Canada's Brian orser scores heavily, increasing the pressure on Scott Hamilton, the event favorite. I guess it's what a lot of people dream of, and it's something that's conceived to be the highest honor in any athletics, and I've been working towards this one for the last five years, really, trying to get a medal here or something, or at least come out feeling good about my amateur career. Hamilton's performance was good, but an inner ear disturbance had affected his balance. '1 felt as if I was skating with 20-pound weights,? said Hamilton. Still, the American crowds got what they came for. Hamilton's huge lead in the compulsories ensured him the gold. Brian orser took the silver, and Soviet Joser Sabovcik the bronze. Friday, February 17. The fog is so dense at the women's slalom, spectators can barely see the last two gates. Twenty-four of the 45 competitors never complete both runs. Us world cup champion Tamara McKinney is among those out of contention. Ifaly's Paoletta Magoni, a long shot, has a very fast time. Christin Cooper never completes her first run. Perrine Pelen once again is in the top three. Ursula Konzett of Liechtenstein holds the lead. And Erika Hess, again, is out of it. We will see 26 competitors from 14 countries. We ask you fo take your place and leave the runs. Thank you. The second run proceeds as scheduled, though the fog shows no signs of lifting and the competitors' visibility is reduced to seven gates. Paoletta Magoni begins her second run. Despite the poor conditions, she is quick and sure, gaining momentum as she goes. Her finish time is superb. But she must wait for Pelen and Konzeltt Perrine Pelen, bronze medallist a week ago in the giant slalom, is next. Pelen has difficully negotiating the upper sections, but by the bottom, she recovers and gathers speed for the finish. It is a brilliant attempt. Still, she does not match Magoni"s time. Magoni and pelen are first and second as Konzeftt, the current leader, begins her run. Konzett fails to maintain her first-run advantage. She finishes third. But even a third-place finish is cherished. Austria's Roswitha Steiner threatens to take it away. To Konzetts great relief, Steiner's time does not hold. Konzelt takes the bronze, Perrine Pelen the silver and Magoni, who said she'd never even dreamed about a medal, wins the gold. In the match between Canada and the Soviet Union, Canada was rendered powerless as the Soviets maintained thelr undefeated status. The final score was four to nothing. February 18. The women's 20k. Marja-Liisa Ham?dlainen is in pursuit of her fourth medal. She has already won two individual golds and a team bronze, more meaals than some entire nations. Her competition will come, once again, from the accomplished Raisa Smetanina from the Soviet Union. H?amadldinen and Smetanina are less than 13 seconds apart at the last interval time. In the final stretch, a tremendous surge by Heamadladinen increases her margin. Exhausted, she crosses the finish fo win her third gold meaal. It is a glorious and unparalleled achievement. Raisa Smetanina finishes the race less than a minute behind the winning time. She claims the silver medal, Nearly a week has passed since East Germany's Jens Weissflog edged out Matti Nyk?nen of Finland in the 70-meter jump. Today, in the 90-meter even, nykanen will have a chance fo even the score. Pavel Ploc of Czechoslovakia is first out of the gate. Ploc's jump pushes him ahead of the other competitors. Jens Weissflog will try to repeat his earlier performance that won him the gold in the 70. Weissflog's jump outdistances the others. If Nykdnen cannot improve li, Weissflog will claim his second win. Matti Nykdnen is next. Nyk?dnen is successful. He wins the gold. With little time to spare between events, the press is quickly escorted fo Trebevic. It is the final runs of the four-man bobsled competition. For one man, it is the final run of a career. I finished. You don't know why you keep doing it? You don't know why? No, no. This is like alcoholic. This is sick, you know. I must go on every - I have done this in 27 years. But after this year, it's finished. Once again, East Germany's number one and two sleds are holding the lead with only one run remaining. Each sled is piloted by the winning crews from the two-man competition. Switzerland and the United States hold the third, fourth and fifth spots. The course is cleared for the deciding run of East Germany's number-two sled. Eins, zwei, drei. In each of the three previous runs, Bernhard Lehmann piloted his crew fo second place. Now they must maintain or improve their time. It is a silver medal finish for East Germany's sled number two. Eins, zwei, drei. East Germany's number-one sled is next, piloted by Wolfgang hoppe, gold medalist in the two-man event and former decathlefe. They win their fourth consecutive run and claim the gold. For the first ime, one nation has taken the gold and silver in both bobsled events. In women's figure skating, there is the emergence of a new talent, usa's 16-year-old Tiffany Chin. Tiffany chin completes the competition in fourth place, creating unexpected pressure for Kira Ivanova of the Soviet Union. Ivanova emerges narrowly with the bronze. Rosalyn Sumners from the United States is in competition for the gold. Her performance is well-received. The only opposition now will come from Katarina Witt of East Germany. Wow! Ah, she's fabulous. That's it. It's done. Good girl! Yeah! Yeah! Katarina Witt wins the gold, Rosalyn Sumners wins the silver, and Kira Ivanova wins the bronze. February 19, 8:00 A.M. The last of the men's cross-country events is beginning. The 50k is the longest and most arduous of the marathon ski races. Sweden's Thomas wassberg, number 48, began his career as a sprinter. Now age and experience has groomed him for distance. This is his third Olympics. Wassberg's teammate, 21-year-old gunde svan, is competing for his fourth olympic medal in these games. Wassberg sets the early pace, but loses it to svan in the second and fourth intervals. Gunde svan crosses the finish n two hours and 16 minutes and wins his fourth medal. It is a stunning performance for one so young. And yet today, the 50-kilometer gold belongs fo Thomas wassberg, 1982's world champion in this event. His dedication to training, his integrity toward team and country, his graciousness in victory has made him one of the most respected olympic competitors. Svan, only five seconds behing, eams the silver the Soviet hockey team's magnificent performance is concluded with a gold-medal victory over the Czechs. And Vladislav trelyak, goaltender in four Olympics, the soul of the team, retires. Trelyak said, "we are here only for the gold medal, and no one can beat us". The Soviets finished undefeated, and Trelyak said farewell. The men's slalom course on bjelasnica is long, the terrain steep and constant. It is predicted that over 40% of the field will not finish. Despite an fis ruling that banned two of slalom's greats, Ingemar Stenmark and Marc Girardelli, the event is widely attended. One of the reasons is the Mahre brothers, both of whom will retire at the end of this race. Steve Mahre, the reigning giant slalom world champion, finished the gs year in 18th place. But today, he's setting a pace no other competitor can equal. Steve Mahre, number three, finishes with the best first-run time. Sweden's Jonas Nilsson is second, and Steve's brother Phil is third. As predicted, nearly 30 skiers are unable to complete the course. The second run promises fo be no easier. More spectators crowd the slope fo see two brothers compete for the gold. On the course is competitor number 16, didier bouvet France. Passing time for competitor number 16, didier bouvet, France, is 23.69 Didier bouvet has a very fast run that could earn him a medal. Phil mahre, 1980's silver medalist and three-time world cup champion, is next. On the course is competitor number 11, Philip mahre, United States. Since his world cup victory last season, Phil faced a year-long slump many expected would follow him here. But Phil executes his second run on the perilous course with speed and precision. Passing time for competitor number 11, Philip mahre, United States, is 23.52, first passing time. A nearly flawless run puts Phil in first place. He radios fo his brother waiting in the start to warn him of changing conditions. 'After the first section,? he says, 'race at full tempo.? Steve mahre, number three, is on course. His early turns are good enough for a gold medal pace, but near the bottom, he has difficulty traversing several gates and loses precious time. Still, Steve mahre finishes only fractions off the winning time. It is a gold and a silver for brothers Phil and Steve mahre of the United States. We've always had a saying: ?Keep it in the family.? '82, I think, was our best year, in a sense, of doing that. We were one, two quite a few times that year. It's a great way to be in the Olympics, I guess you could say. Didier bouvet of France claimed the bronze. As Phil and Steve mabhre retire, a final chapter of olympic history is being written. They entered the games on a losing streak. They concluded them with a gold and silver medal and reminded us that the Olympics can be a turning point for anyone. After ten days of competition, the olympic games have come fo an end. Soon the crowds will disperse, the athletes will return to their homes, but in the perpetual light that is our memory, the glow of these days will persist, and we will remember with pride the accomplishments here.
