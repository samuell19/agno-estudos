WHAT DO YOU THINK? [CHUCKLING] WELL, I THINK YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW HE COMPARES TO YOU. WELL, HOW DOES HE? HE DOESN’T. REALLY? WHY? I MAY HAVE HAD SEX WITH HIM, BUT... I LOVE YOU. I DON’T APPROVE OF WHAT HE’S DOING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I DON'T KNOW. IT GETS COMPLICATED. SIMPLIFY IT FOR ME. MY PARENTS ALWAYS HAD HIM ON A PEDESTAL. AFTER I FOUND OUT ABOUT HIM, THAT’S WHEN I KEPT MY DISTANCE. I WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT AFFECTED MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MOM, BECAUSE HE LIVED WITH HER. WAIT, YOU NEVER VISITED... YOU NEVER VISITED YOUR MOTHER BECAUSE OF YOUR BROTHER? MICHAEL! AFTER OUR DAD DIED, THAT’S WHEN I KEPT MY DISTANCE. BABY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M GOING TO BE FINE.

DON’T YOU THINK IT WILL BE KIND OF AWKWARD AFTER WHAT HAPPENED WITH CHANEL? NO, WHY? MICHAEL ALREADY KNOWS WHAT SHE DID. BUT WHAT ABOUT HER? WHAT ABOUT HER? SHE'S THE ONE THAT CAME ON TO YOU. LET'S JUST SEE HOW THINGS GO, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. WELL, I’M HUNGRY. YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT? YOU GO AHEAD. I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE. YOU KNOW WHAT? CHANEL HAS SOMETHING SHE NEEDS TO TELL YOU. GO AHEAD. [SIGHS] I’M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT, OKAY? IT WAS WRONG FOR ME TO DO WHAT I DID. YOU’RE RIGHT. HEY, SHE'S TRYING HERE, ALL RIGHT? LOOK, IT’S OKAY. I DON’T KNOW WHAT GOT INTO ME. IF I HURT YOU IN ANY WAY, I APOLOGIZE. HE'S STRAIGHT, ISN'T HE? YEAH! JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT. I MIGHT AS WELL GET THAT SUITCASE. GOOD IDEA. SO, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR TODAY? I DON’T KNOW YET. BUT I FIGURED, FINDING OUT WHAT MOM LET IN THE SUITCASE IS A GOOD START. SO, DO YOU KNOW THE COMBINATION TO THIS? OH. MOM SAID TO LOOK BEHIND THE PHONE. "666... " MM-HMM? "568... 37-87." THERE WE... [LATCH CLICKS] OH, THERE IT IS! WHAT DOES IT SAY? ALL RIGHT. LET’S SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE. "DEAR MICHAEL AND JULIAN, "I’D LIKE TO SAY THAT I LOVE YOU BOTH VERY MUCH...

"YOUR FATHER AND I NAMED THE TREE TABOGA, "AFTER WE RETURNED HOME FROM OUR ENGAGEMENT TRIP FROM TABOGA ISLAND IN PANAMA. "IN THE SUITCASE, YOU’LL FIND DIRECTIONS. "I WANT YOU AND YOUR BROTHER TO DELIVER MY REMAINS ALONE. "I’VE INCLUDED A PRAYER IN THE ENVELOPE "SECLUDED IN WHICH YOU SHOULD ONLY OPEN "PRIOR TO SPREADING MY ASHES. "BY THE TIME YOU’RE READING THIS LETTER, "I WOULD HAVE PASSED ON. "I WOULD HAVE ASKED MY LIFELONG FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR WINNIE "TO ARRANGE MY FINAL WISHES WITH FATHER JOSIAH. "YOU MAY PICK UP MY REMAINS FROM HIM AT THE CHURCH. [MOTHER’S VOICE] "I WON’T SAY GOODBYE BECAUSE DEATH IS ONLY A DETOUR "ALONG LIFE’S WINDING WAY. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. MOM." ♪♪ [CHURCH ORGAN] LET’S HOLD HANDS... AND SAY A PRAYER FOR YOUR MOTHER. OH, HEAVENLY FATHER, WE GIVE YOU THANKS FOR SENDING US KATHRYN ANGELA ROBINSON. WE KNOW, FATHER, THAT YOU DECIDE... WHEN WE STAY AND WHEN WE GO. WE THANK YOU FOR THE TIMES WE HAD WITH HER, AND FOR ALL SHE DID IN YOUR NAME WHILE SHE WAS VISITING US... AND WE’RE CONFIDENT IN KNOWING THAT NOW THAT SHE IS WITH YOU, HER SONS, JULIAN AND MICHAEL, WILL FIND SOLACE AND COMFORT. MAY HER SOUL REST IN PEACE AND HARMONY, IN KNOWING THAT YOU, WHO HAVE CREATED US, HAVE A PLAN MUCH BIGGER FOR ALL OF US. WE ASK FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR ALL OF OUR SINS, FOR WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE A FORGIVING FATHER. AND MAY HER SONS FIND THE PATH TO RIGHTEOUSNESS, AS THEY ENGAGE IN THEIR JOURNEY TO DELIVER THEIR MOTHER TO YOU, OH LORD. IN YOUR NAME, WE ASK OF THEE, AMEN. MAY THE LORD KEEP YOU AND KEEP YOUR SAFE YOU IN YOUR JOURNEY. THANK YOU, FATHER. WHEN DO YOU LEAVE? OH, LEAVING EARLY TOMORROW MORNING. YOUR MOTHER WAS AN ADMIRABLE WOMAN. OUR DOORS WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN TO YOU. ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A TOMORROW WHERE THE SUN WILL SHINE UPON YOU. GOOD LUCK. HEY. HI. HOW DID IT GO? GOOD. JUST GETTING READY. HOW ABOUT YOU? HOW ARE YOU DOING? I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I’D LIKE TO STICK AROUND, BUT YOUR MOTHER WANTED ONLY YOU AND YOUR BROTHER TO TAKE THIS TRIP. I CAN RESPECT THAT. WELL, ARE YOU GOING TO BE HERE WHEN I GET BACK? I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING. I UNDERSTAND. I CAN’T BE EMOTIONALLY AVAILABLE TO YOU. AT LEAST NOT THE WAY YOU EXCEPT ME TO. I’M NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING FROM YOU, STEVEN. YOU CHOSE TO COME HERE. I KNOW. DO YOU REGRET MEETING ME? HOW CAN YOU ASK ME SOMETHING LIKE THAT? OF COURSE NOT. I CAME HERE BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE HERE. WITH YOU. THEN WHY THE DOUBT? I MEAN, FOR SOMEONE WHO SEEMS SO CONFIDENT, YOU DON’T SEEM SURE ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT. I MEAN, I MAY NOT HAVE MUCH, AS YOU CAN SEE, BUT I DO KNOW WHO I AM AND WHO I WANT. JULIAN, WE PRACTICALLY JUST MET. I CARE ABOUT YOU AS A FRIEND AND WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. IT’S A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR YOU, AND I WANT TO BE HERE. SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU ARE STAYING? AT LEAST UNTIL YOU LEAVE TOMORROW MORNING. YOU KNOW, I NEVER ASKED, BUT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU DO? I WAS A TRUST FUND KID. I INVESTED MY MONEY WELL IN THE STOCK MARKET, AND I OWN MY OWN REAL ESTATE COMPANY. WELL, IT SOUNDS SUCCESSFUL. IT’S NOT MUCH IF YOU DON’T HAVE SOMEONE TO SHARE IT WITH. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE? I’M NOT SURE. EVERY TIME I THINK THINGS ARE GOING GREAT, SOMETHING HAPPENS, AND I’M RIGHT BACK WHERE I STARTED FROM. I MEAN, I CAN NEVER SEEM TO GET MY LIFE TOGETHER. I’D LIKE TO OWN MY OWN BUSINESS SOMEDAY TOO, BUT I NEVER SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. I MEAN, I DON’T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH MONEY RIGHT NOW TO SURVIVE. WHAT ABOUT THIS HOUSE? I’D LIKE TO KEEP THIS HOUSE. I MEAN, THIS IS WHERE ALL MY MEMORIES ARE. BUT I'M NOT SURE I CAN AFFORD IT. AND MICHAEL? WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL? I DON'T KNOW. CAN'T HE HELP OUT? I DON’T TRUST MICHAEL. THE ONLY TIME WE EVER SAW HIM WAS WHEN HE WANTED TO BORROW OR STEAL MONEY FROM US. I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU OUT. THANKS, BUT NO THANKS. BESIDES, I DON’T WANT ANY HANDOUTS. EVERYTHING I HAVE, I'VE EARNED. WELL, I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU’D BE INTERESTED IN HELPING ME WITH MY BUSINESS. WOULD THAT WORK FOR YOU? I MEAN, BECAUSE IT WON’T WORK FOR ME. IN CASE YOU HAVEN’T NOTICED, I LIKE YOU. I MEAN, WHAT AM I SUPPOSE TO DO WITH MY FEELINGS? I DON’T KNOW. I LIKE YOU A LOT. IT SAYS WE NEED TO GO THROUGH HERE. DUDE, WHERE IS THIS PLACE? I HOPE YOU’RE UP FOR A HIKE. LET’S JUST GET THIS OVER WITH. JULIAN! I GOT TO TAKE A BREAK. REST HERE. DUDE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? FOLLOWING THESE DIRECTIONS. [SNORTING] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? DUDE. I'M FUCKING RELAXING. RELAXING! WHAT THE FUCK... I MEAN, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING? I JUST DO IT ON OCCASION. JEEZ. MICHAEL, I AM SO SICK OF YOUR BULLSHIT! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU PUT MOM AND I THROUGH BECAUSE OF IT? DO YOU? HAVE SOME FUCKING RESPECT FOR YOURSELF! WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU, YOU LITTLE BITCH? FUCK YOU, DUDE! JESUS CHRIST, MAN! [SHOUTING] FUCKING BITCH! I FUCKING HATE YOU! COCKSUCKER! FUCK THIS! FUCK YOU, MICHAEL! WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU FUCKED UP. DON’T YOU EVEN SEE WHY MOM SENT US BOTH OUT HERE? DON’T YOU HAVE ANY IDEA? ARE YOU THAT FUCKING BLIND? I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS! NEITHER DID I! GROW THE FUCK UP. WHAT'S THE FUCKIN’ USE. DON’T BE A PRICK, DUDE. WHAT THE HELL, MAN. FUCKING DRUGGIE. FUCK YOU, DUDE. I’M DOING THIS ON MY OWN. YOU FUCKING GAY FAG! FUCK YOU! JULIAN, WAIT! DUDE, JULIAN... DUDE, WAIT UP. STOP BEING... DUDE, DON’T BE A FUCKIN’ BITCH, DUDE! YOU ALWAYS DO THIS SHIT, BRO. COME ON! JULIAN, COME ON! JESUS. LOOK, I’M SORRY! [JULIAN] IT'S TOO LATE MICHAEL, SHE'S DEAD. GOT IT? WHAT ABOUT YOU? DON’T YOU THINK YOU MADE MOM SICK KNOWING SHE HAD A FUCKING FAGGOT OF A SON? AT LEAST I CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT MY CONDITION. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT MADE HER FEEL? SHE LOVED ME. REGARDLESS, SHE LOVED ME! AND I KNOW THAT, BECAUSE I WAS WITH HER. I DIDN'T GIVE UP ON MYSELF LIKE YOU DID. SO NOW YOU’RE BETTER THAN ME? WHY DID YOU COME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? HUH, MICHAEL? WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE? HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU NEED THIS TIME? BOY, YOU MUST BE IN A HELL OF A LOT OF FUCKIN’ TROUBLE TO HAVE BROUGHT YOUR TWEAKER OF A GIRLFRIEND HERE WITH YOU TO HELP BURY YOUR OWN MOTHER! IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT? BECAUSE THAT’S ALL YOU EVER FUCKIN’ WANTED FROM US. TAKE IT, MICHAEL! TAKE IT ALL! AND SHOVE UP YOUR FUCKIN’ NOSE, LIKE YOU’VE DONE WITH THE REST OF OUR GODDAMN MONEY! WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? I’M THE GUY WHO WORKED EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK TO HELP KEEP A ROOF OVER YOUR MOTHER’S HEAD. WHO PAID THE FUCKIN’ BILLS. WHO VISITED HER BECAUSE SHE HADN’T GOT A CALL FROM HER SON, MICHAEL, IN SEVERAL MONTHS, AND SHE DIDN’T KNOW IF HE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE? HOW COULD I BE AROUND HER WHEN SHE CHOSE TO BE WITH YOU? JULIAN THIS, AND JULIAN THAT. EVERYTHING WAS ALWAYS ABOUT YOU. AND I WASN’T GOING TO SIT AROUND TO SEE YOU LIVE OUT YOUR FILTHY FUCKIN’ LIFESTYLE. YOU MAKE ME SICK! NICE TO KNOW HOW YOU REALLY FEEL, MICHAEL. FUCKING PATHETIC! FUCK! JULIAN, WAIT! [SOBBING] [SOBBING, SCREAMING] [SCREAMS]
