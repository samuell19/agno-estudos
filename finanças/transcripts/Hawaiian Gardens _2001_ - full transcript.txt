Maybe it's your problem, that you are chasing after one single guy, when you're usually after a dozen. I'm the boss, and I do what I think is right. Yeah, Baldi, you run the company, but the company is out of step. We are used to you calling several times a day to keep thing moving. Do you think that suddenly everybody knows what to do?

(Shulzov chuckling) Can we talk? - Sure. - He's a businessman from Germany. "Out of the Bavarian Woods," is how he puts it. He runs something similar to a publishing house, but it feels more like virtual to me, Internet stuff. He travels all over the world in order to find his merchandise. He visits old or unknown or forgotten writers and he buys their unpublished work. - Hmm. Well this is very interesting. But how did you make him talk? - That's none of your business, Mr. Shulzov. - How does he find the writers? - He didn't say. - How does he pay them? - He didn't tell me. - How does he make money off them? - I don't know yet. - Find out. - How do you look when you're not on the road? - Same. - See, I suspected that. - What do you mean? - Well you're poor like us, except for your world phone and your plane ticket.

So you need to tell me. - Make a guess. - What? - How much I make. - Oh, three grand a month. - More. - Five. - More. - 10. - More. - 20. - More. - Baldi, stop it. I'm not joking. I'm not kidding. I'm serious. - I'm too, Rosa. Come on, go on. - You know what? This doesn't feel real. This just doesn't feel real to me. - Rosa, come on. Say any number. - Uh. 100,000, 200,000, 300,000, 400,000, 500,000, 600,000. A million. - That's pretty close. - Bullshit. You mean to tell me that your company is making $1 million a year. - No. - Good. - That's what I meant per month. (coyotes barking) (crickets chirping) - Shulzov, he's making millions. - Off book writes from old unknowns? That's bullshit. - You think he's lying. - Yes. - I don't. How late is it? - Well not too late, I hope. (announcer speaking in foreign language) - It just kills me that masterpieces from your hand are wanting somewhere without being enjoyed by so many people like myself. - Maybe I'm not interested. - But it's not about you. It's about your work. See. (speaks in foreign language) I have this publisher friend in Germany. Small, very selective. It wouldn't hurt you if I show him some manuscript of yours. See. This is a very simple agreement allowing me to try something without infringing in your genuine copyrights. Give it a look. Now what do you think? (Shulzov sighing) (paper flicking) - Some old stories for starters. - Thank you, Mr. Shulzov. And if you want, I could come back tomorrow and make you copies of everything you have. I could even create an inventory list for you. Costs you not a dime. - And you return everything the same day? - In a few hours. - Amazing. And you don't forget to make a copy for yourself. - Just a small sign of my admiration. Rosa. - [Rosa] How did you find me? - Kiss me, Rosa. (Rosa chuckling) Kiss me. - Don't be silly. Aye, come help. Come help. Here, gimme the- - What? - Go ahead, pass me that bag so nobody gets it. (coins clinking) So how was your meeting? - Good. - [Rosa] Yeah? - He gave me a script. - He never does that. - He likes me. (Rosa chuckling) I know you are curious with all that I'm doing. - I'm not. - Wow. Embrace me, Rosa. (Baldi and Rosa chuckling) Will you stay like this for awhile if I tell you about my life? Hmm? - It depends. - Three months I travel. Three months I'm in my office. Three months I travel and three months I'm in my office again. I've doing this since I'm 19. - How's Alexandria? You won't believe this. He has an unbelievable schedule. For example, he goes to Egypt. He starts in Cairo, visits some cultural institutions always looking like a student. Libraries, bookshops, book clubs, you name it. And in less than a day, he collects over 100 addresses of old writers. He goes through- - He does the same routine as he did with me offering the poor old guys and girls some hope and $100 bill, copies all their stuff and they never hear from him again. - Yes, now listen to these numbers. 78 writers in Vietnam in 10 weeks, 121 in Nigeria in 11 weeks, 53 in Malaysia in five weeks, over 200 in Brazil in 12 weeks. - He rips 'em off, gives 'em no more than a tip and he amasses copyrights, ideas the knowledge of the world. But. - But what, Shulzov? - How does he sell it? - You want to go to Magic Mountain tomorrow? Hmm? - Hmm, let's see. Maybe. ♪ Chenki chenki chenki chenki ♪ - Oh, you know?

They do everything except invent something. - But this is what he needs the writers for. - We are just 13 guys. Each of us has a very different thing to cover. Hundred of specialists are working for us. Analysts, editors, translators and distributors, designers, Internet scanners, web runners. - Students, housewives, jobless teachers, all for minimum wages. All this stuff he drags in from abroad is categorized, labeled and channeled. - In Bombay alone, we use three companies which are just finding addresses and opening doors for us worldwide. - For example, a Korean TV station wants something similar to "Baywatch". They get their stories for their series from Baldi's firm by the dozens or by the hundreds, whatever they need. The master story computer's memory knows every original idea Baldi's ever collected from the old writers. His editors just feed it into this TV series structure device and here you have your treatments for a series. It even comes with budgets attached. - And the names of the original writers are never used. It's no longer their work anyway. - The Bombay Company finds every publisher, film company, advertising agency, big or small from Hollywood to Hong Kong and knocks at their doors. - We sell stories for children, romance, horror, sex, science-fiction, house and garden. We sell for pennies and for millions. - And their clients make their electronic payments directly into the County Savings & Loan Bank in Bayerisch Eisenstein in the Bavarian Woods.

He wants to be around real people like us. It's what feeds his art. So why do you bother him, huh? - Sleep with me. Please, Rosa, stay with me. - You know, I thought about everything you told me. Everything makes sense except for Shulzov. Why him? - Will you sleep with me if I tell you? - Tell me. - Come closer. Come. I own your software. It uses the brand scent of masterpieces.

Nobody wants to risk our insane success. Don't you get it? Why don't you do this with a new company? New software, new company! You don't have to travel all the time. We have material until retirement. We need our boss here with us, don't you understand that? And not one who shuts down their phone for two weeks.. Cut it out! You're all fired. Go ahead, Baldi, do it. (plane engine roaring) - Aye, aye, aye. - I know. I know. (soft somber music) (Baldi breathing heavily) (Rosa laughing) - Mr. Shulzov, I will always be your friend. (Consuela gasping) (Bruno chuckling) - So do you think it was the right move? Close the door! Power to the Authors. With "The plan" Stephen King writes Bestseller on the Internet without publisher. Sneaky Stephen King uses his power as bestseller guarantor and points out the weak position of authors. Respect my copyright. It's all I have as a writer. (group laughing) So we have the major deal from API TV in Seoul. Hu'o'ng in Hong Kong can take care of it, right? Who's for it? We have to define the new software. We got a Bittmail from a company. They're all greedy pigs. I know. There are others that aren't so stuffed yet. Excuse me Miss, this is an office. Would you mind leaving... Miss, I don't know if you heard... - [Rosa] Hi Baldi. - Rosa. What are you doing...? (Baldi thudding) - Hey. Baldi. (soft somber music) (soft intriguing music) (people chattering) If all were here.... Baldi is coming later, right? He didn't say. He'll be here soon. Hi. - Kus-cut. Beer's no good today? You know Rosa, right! You could have at least told us. You mean, we should have voted? This is the way it is. Sit down, dammit. This is stupid. Are we 14. Should I get another Knödel out of the garden, like a head of salad? Stop pissing us off. Never mind. I have extra for unforeseen situations. SHITuations! - Is there a problem? - No, no, no. It's a man's party, no money. Sit down! The Knödel are getting cold! - So what is it you do professionally? - Oh, I'm a student. - University, eh? UCLA or what? They're collapsing. - No, no college. I take my finals this year. She's a school girl - What are they saying? - That you screw around. Who cares if he brings a school girl to Germknödeln. Quit provoking. - Does this contain alcohol? She's asking if the beer has alcohol. (group laughing) I'm done!! Fucking Knödel shit!! (dishes clattering) (Shulzov sighing) - Edwin! - So how much money do you actually have? - You mean cash and stocks and all? - Yeah, of course all together. - About 280 million. - Do you realize that most of this money is stolen? Why do you need so much money anyway? - I want to retire when I'm turning 38. This is our policy. - For all of you. - All. (Edwin speaking in foreign language) (Baldi speaking in foreign language) (dog barking) - Rosa. I wanted to ask you, Rosa. - You don't like nature, do you? - I don't know what to do with it. - Then why do you bring me here? - Because. (dog barking) Rosa. Rosa. (Rosa scoffing) Rosa. I feel like I'm drowning, Rosa. (Rosa chuckling) Yes. Please tell me, Rosa. Tell me please how many boyfriends you had. - How many girlfriends did you have, Baldi? (Baldi chuckling) - You're my first. - I'm not your girlfriend. (dog barking) - Rosa, you're killing me. - Bladi, are you aware of the fact that 90% of what writers create only make others wealthy? If a successful writer gets 10% of his sales, he's considered lucky and you don't even give 'em this minimum. As a matter of fact, you should give 'em much more. - Why do you want me to be the guinea pig for all the others? - Because I met you, not the others. It was your bad luck that you came across me and Shulzov. - No. Good luck, Rosa. I call it my lucky number. Rosa, can I ask you something? (car horn honking) - Look, Saint Peter. The one with the keys. San Pedro. That's my father's name. - Marry me, Rosa. Please. (knife grinding) (dog barking) - Can you find all the writers you've signed up? Can you break down all the royalties you've kept? Can you and will you pay your debt to them correctly and without unnecessary delay? - Rosa, don't you have the smallest question about us? Hmm? - Oh, hi Joseph. Can I have some coffee? - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. - Hello. - How are you? - I'm good, thanks. (Rosa chuckling) (Fritz chuckling) (knife thudding) You basket case! Are you nuts? Crazy or what? I'm sorry I'm sorry - I think I took too much of a risk. - It's all my fault. - I told her there might be a way of finding out if his nasty business really exists and that would be to check on it and its location. - It's all my fault. - I bought her the roundtrip ticket (slaps) and Rosa went. I think I took too much of a risk. - Senora Conuela's husband is back. - Stop it. Stop it! (shrieks) (fist bashing) Bruno, run! (apple crunching) - Tastes different than ours. So how come you don't have any female partners here, huh? - We didn't want to be distracted. - Uh-huh. - What do you think about my question? You think about my question? - Baldi. I wanna finish high school. I wanna go to college, university maybe. Shulzov thinks that- - You can do that here. - Where's your life, huh? - What do you mean? - Where do you live? - You would not like it. - Let me decide. - Okay. - 'Kay. - No, this way. ♪ We share a certain hunger ♪ - I show it. ♪ A scent we can't ignore ♪ - Come. ♪ She closes all ♪ ♪ Escape routes ♪ ♪ Just looking in your eyes ♪ ♪ She's shinin' like the full moon ♪ ♪ No clouds obscure the sky ♪ ♪ So why can't I find ♪ ♪ My way to your door ♪ - Shulzov and you, not much of a difference in terms of expensive lifestyle. - Why do you sleep with your old man? - What? - You both told me. - Shulzov and me? No. He's my mentor, my very best friend. - The Mall Owner, Rosa. - You mean MO? - Yes. I see you with him all the time. It's haunting me. It's destroying me. What did he do with you? How long? How often? Does he still come to you? - MO never touched me. - You both told me in his car. - We were just teasing you. - Oh. This is too cruel, Rosa. - You're calling other people cruel, huh? Look at me, Baldi. Don't you know that you could be my hero? No, but you're a bloodsucker and a cheat. This is why you can't feel anything, why all your senses are clogged. They're clogged by your greed. - I don't believe you, Rosa. Your father is in jail for selling you to this black man. - My father needed to pay his loan. That's true. He was desperate. That's true. MO gave him some drugs. My father sold them. Bruno turned him in. - I love you. - I know. - (sniffles) Why? Why can't you say I love you? - Baldi, where are you going? Baldi, what are you doing? - [Baldi] Cooling off! (water trickling) (Rosa laughing) - [Rosa] Get out of there. God, you're stupid. Come here. Come on. (soft romantic music) (Rosa moaning pleasurably) (Baldi grunting pleasurably) (Rosa laughing) - Don't leave me, Rosa. I will never let you go. Never. (bell tolling) Sleep well, Rosa. See you later? - Sure, Baldi. (door banging) - Good morning. - Morning. You don't have to go in there, Mr. Graf. The young lady left this morning. She left? - Sure, Baldi. Did she leave something, a note, a phone number? No, nothing! She wanted to take the 7:53 train to the Munich airport, I think. (soft romantic music) - Dad. Dad! Dad! Oh my god. You're back again. Oh dad, you're mine. Oh my god. - Oh, my baby. - Mom! Oh, I missed you so much. - I missed you too, mom. - Hi Miss Germany. You've come back for a sweet smile. - Shirin, darling. - The sun is rising, Miss Rosa. And we'll welcome you back. - Thank you, Mr. Hu'o'ng - Well you look tired. And what did you read while you were away? - Nothing. I couldn't concentrate. - Why not? See? - What? - He changed you. He changed us. We can no longer talk about books. - Shulz, don't do that. - I could kill him for coming here and destroying things. - Why, just because somebody was interested in me? You're going too far. - See? - I thought this was about the way he handled his business. - I no longer care. Why'd you come back? Just to see your parents once more, pack up and leave? You don't even try to defend yourself. - Why should I? - I think it's time to report him. No? - We spent the night in his office. (soft somber music) Put his entire setup on a search engine, including a list of thousands of unpaid writers. - You think he'll come back? - That's up to him. (smooth rhythmic music) - Okay, we're gonna have a photo op. Photo op. Hold on, hold on. Lookin' good. All right, beautiful photo. Yeah. Wonderful. And the lady of the hour. Oh yes. You are the star. - No. (group chattering) - Absolutely beautiful. (chuckles) All right, three shot. Here we go. Here we go. - You don't wanna come? Come on and play. (smooth rhythmic music) Are you coming? - I'll be there. - [Rosa] You better. (smooth rhythmic music) (people chattering) - [Consuela] Baby, lemme help you. - Come on, come on. You gotta admit it was very hot up there. He spoke too long. He could've taken 15 minutes. (group chattering) - [Shirin] (gasps) Mr. Hu'o'ng, he came. - Thank you, Mr. Hu'o'ng. (chuckles) - Dinner's gonna be ready in a moment. - Oh wait. I'd like to say a few words if I could please. - Shh, shh, shh. Everyone, silence. Rosa wants to speak. - I just wanna say thank you for helping me not only so I could concentrate on school but with everything else. You know what I mean. (chuckles) - [MO] Here, here. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Good. - Hello Baldi, (speaks in foreign language). (fabric tearing) (soft romantic music) I'll be down in a second, okay? Wait. - Mister. Tea?
