Looks so good! But so expensive! Cost me half a month's pay. Come on, take a look. I'm looking. Take a look. Don't jump on the bed! That was dangerous. We're finally going! Look at this. Look, ice. Sure you want to sleep on this? We're going all this way, so we have to check it out. But... I wonder what "doing it" on this will feel like. My balls will probably freeze. Won't they turn into... two frozen dumplings? Defrosting frozen buns! Defrosting dumplings! Next up, shrimp dumplings. First, follow the packet instructions and heat up. Heating time: 15 minutes. Aroma performance normal. Inner filling and outer skin performance normal. But the crispiness of the shrimp isn't as good as the last batch. I think so too. What? What is it? Don't eat it, spit it out. Take a seat. Are you all right? I'm OK. - It's just morning sickness. - Huh? Wait. So the sample is OK? It's fine! Why didn't you tell us? It hasn't been 3 months yet, so I couldn't. Must be hard on you. Finally, after 5 years of marriage. Did you hear that? Nope. Mei-pao, you have to make the most of it. Get pregnant on your Northern Europe honeymoon. Two birds with one stone! That's too rushed. It's not! Good luck. Good luck yourself. Where's your baby? What's going on here? Why have our products been replaced? Over here as well. Did you get a notice? No. That's weird. Manager Huang! Did your shelf-stackers make a mistake? Why are there are other brands on our shelf space? Why are you running? Your sales have been poor these last 6 months. We've wanted to replace your shelf space for ages. I just... haven't told you yet. Wait a second! We've been cooperating for so long, you can't just remove our products like that. Don't get mad. Look around. There are so many products popular online now. They're much easier to sell. But it's so obviously delicious. The frozen foods market is really competitive now. There are a lot of small brands entering. Lots of mothers who like to cook, young people. They create their own brands and sell on Facebook. Facebook? Those personal brands have that intimacy old brands like ours lack. Young consumers really like to try new things too. It's like their relationships. In that case, Mei-pao. Your team is the youngest. You also know the taste of our products the best. Your team shall handle our entire sales strategy. What? For real? Yes. Find out exactly what young people are looking for in their food these days. OK, I'm leaving everything to you. Because of you. - Mei-pao. - What are you looking at? Thank you! Try a free sample! Free to try! Give it a shot! - This is really spicy. - This is what young people are buying up online. I've analyzed the 20 most popular products. Try our buns! Try our cabbage dumplings! We have shaomai and we have dumplings. - Tomato meat sauce dumplings. - Tomato sauce? The red is cool, huh? Artificial coloring. OK, time's up. - Another batch. - My God. Miss, please check out our spaghetti. It's on special. Free sample! There's shaomai and dumplings. But it's so obviously delicious. Reschedule? I had finally gotten leave approval! It's not like I have a choice. If I went on a vacation right now, what would my boss think? What would my colleagues think? Did you ever think about how I'd feel? No! Because you only think about yourself. I want to go too. Can't you be more considerate? Hsiao-lai! It's still cold! Morning. There's a table of 8 today, arriving at 7pm. They're having both appetizers and salad. You might have to help me with the soup. OK. Then check how many carrots and potatoes are left. A-Shi. Check this out. Pretty fresh today. I said I don't want anything frozen. The quality's not bad. Give it a try. Tastes almost like it's fresh. "Almost" isn't good enough. Give it a shot. Don't be like that. A-Shi. Frozen is 3 times cheaper than fresh. I'm helping you save money. Running a restaurant can't be easy. I'll say it again: My restaurant only uses fresh food. You think customers can tell? Table 5: ravioli, pork chop and steamed fish. OK, got it. Table 13's salad is ready. OK. Get me a knife. OK. Table 8's steamed fish is ready! Coming! This restaurant is awesome. Farm salad. Photo time. Take a photo with it. 1, 2, 3. Anybody here? Anybody here? Excuse me, is anybody here? Hi. We're on our afternoon break. I called earlier. Oh. This is my card. My name is Tseng Mei-pao. Good For You Frozen Foods. Yes. These are our company's products. For you. I hate frozen foods. But our company genuinely wants to work with you. We want the general public to know that frozen foods can taste very good too. This crap is not worthy of being called food. Get to work. Ben, do frozen food eaters know what tastes good? I doubt it. - I'll go set up first. - OK. Can you confirm how many bookings we have tonight? OK, I'll check later. Otherwise, maybe you can try our No. 1 ranked pork and cabbage dumplings. Also, these shaomai are bestsellers too. There's many others, like meat buns, spaghetti. Or if there is anything in particular you like, I can bring it over for you. Please try them first, then we can discuss. What I make is real food, not this icy cold stuff. Miss, excuse me. - Make sure the onions are fully cooked. - OK. - And control the heat for the broth. - OK. Can you please have another think about it? I still have a lot of food to prepare. Is there a table tonight that doesn't eat beef? Yes, changing main courses to fish and lamb. Sorry to have bothered you. Wait. Please take all of this with you. It's OK. You keep it. It's a hassle for me to throw it out. Yeah, we'd have to sort through it for recycling. There's only one planet Earth. We have to protect the environment. Hey! Hey! All that effort just to get humiliated by you. Only idiots who eat at your restaurant are people. Right? Frozen food eaters aren't people, right? Snob! Eat shit! Missy, your eggs are out of date. My eggs? A whole carton of eggs out of date. What a waste. This jam expired 2 years ago. It belongs in a museum. I really don't know how you can live like this. What is this? I don't know. Don't know? Missy, please. Don't just toss in the fridge and forget about it. Do you know what an expiration date is? Why did you suddenly show up like this? I showed up to make you dumplings, curry rice. If you don't like it, I'll just take it with me. You're the best. You're the best. Heartless. By the way, that's for you. I don't need it any more. Wow, so many pads. This'll last me till menopause. What's wrong? You think too much. You're still young and pretty. Right? Your hair is so nice. Such supple skin. Such sexy lips. That's enough. Let me tell you. Life may seem long, but really, it's all over in a flash. Just to think, when I got with your father, we were still studying. He didn't even want me to have you. I was the one who decided to keep you. Did you know I was only 22 at the time? Tell me, how old are you now? Here we go again. I mean, you two have been together for so long. You should at least have a plan. We were planning to go to Northern Europe. But who knows when we'll be able to go now? Northern Europe? Please, Missy. All you young people do is plan where to travel and what to eat. Please, why not plan for what's most important? What about you? Let me tell you. Men can have children at 70, 80. A woman's biological clock isn't like theirs. We can't just pop babies out at will. OK, can you stop worrying? Look at those female celebrities on TV. They're all having children in their 40s. Those celebrities can afford the supplements. You think you're a big celebrity now? I've got my mother's stir-fried noodles. Let me tell you. Time is precious. It's gone in a flash! OK, next. I think the skin's too thick. Is it? - You don't think? - What flavor is it? Pumpkin. Please pay attention. - These dumplings smell like Hsiao-lai. - How do you know what he smells like? - Yeah, have you been smelling me? - Take it seriously. Try these. The production line just started testing them. I think the flavor is not bad. What's in this? The aroma's really thick. Mei-pao! - What happened? - Hey! Warn the production line! Mei-pao! Was it really that bad? I think the way you treat us, treat me, is like a bag of dumplings in the fridge. You feel safe as long as it's there. When you want some, you'll heat up a few. But there's no warmth left between us. I don't want to keep lying to myself. Food only tastes good when it's fresh. Freeze it and it won't go bad, but the taste eventually does. Had you wanted to go somewhere warmer? Mei-pao. We're past our expiration date. Ice. Sure you want to sleep on this? We're going all this way, so we have to check it out. I wonder what "doing it" on this will feel like. Then hurry up and defrost me. Defrosting frozen buns! Defrosting dumplings! Stop bothering me! So what? You got dumped. It's not like you got fat. For you. What? Take it. Action is power. "Good. For. You." Make sure you look at it. Reading is protecting. I had been with my ex for 5 years, but you never know with relationships. I'm the legal counsel of a major tech company. I'm always busy flying all around the world. I'm 26 years old, the age my eggs are at their healthiest. On my 40th birthday, I suddenly realized I only had 2 choices: Pension insurance or a pre-need plan. Was I destined to be alone forever? When we broke up, I was already 35. I don't know when my next relationship will come. So I made this decision. No harm in being prepared. In life, you never know what might happen next. Right? I can now focus on my career. As for love, just go with the flow. I can live the life I want, without worrying about age. It's a wonderful feeling. What's amazing is that a week after the procedure, I met my future husband. Fortunately, it wasn't too late. Make the call. Egg freezing is mankind's future. Phone now for an appointment. For me, egg freezing is actually a form of insurance. It's like buying lifetime happiness insurance. While your body can still produce healthy eggs, preserve them. That way, you'll have more time to look for Mr Right. After sperm and eggs are retrieved, we will store them here, and place in a minus-196 degrees Celsius freezer. Wow, that's even colder than Iceland. The maximum preservation period is 10 years. 10 years... Think about it. Is there a health product that can freeze your age for 10 years? What do you want in life? Have you thought about it? I... want happiness. Perhaps their kind of happiness. Or maybe another kind. I'm not really sure. No matter what kind it is, you just want to preserve a chance at happiness, right? Over here. Come with me. This is it. What am I doing? Waiting. Waiting? Waiting for what? The right time. The right person. Let's give a warm welcome to our new classmate! Welcome to our big family. Look, everyone is the same here. We're all waiting to be born. Cheers! Here's to being born soon! Cheers! Here, seniority is determined by time of freezing. Right now, you're the newest, so just call everyone "Senior". - How long have you been frozen? - Hi, senior. 143 days. - 8 months. - 3 years for me. Wow, can't tell. You've really looked after yourself. Please look after our new classmate. Hi, Senior. How long have you been frozen? Don't you know it's rude to ask people their age? Her mom is the superstar who must not be named. Let me tell you. Over here, everyone has a story. My mom's too busy working to find love, so she decided to freeze me. My mother doesn't really want a baby. But she's worried she may regret it, so here I am. I'm from Brazil. I've been frozen for 2 months. I'm from Shanghai. Frozen more than a year. I feel bad for my mom. The men she likes are all from Korean soap operas or close friends. She wants a rich guy, but they don't care about feelings. Guys who care about feelings aren't trendy enough. Guys who are too trendy probably like other guys. Scarier still, those born after 1990 have appeared and they're sweeping the entire market. Mom, I want to get out. You have to try harder! I heard the outside world is full of good food. My dad's from a wealthy family. You know how rich men are all playboys. One day he drove his Porsche and took some babes on a joyride. He had an accident, which freaked out his mistress. So then, she decided to freeze me in secret, leaving behind a seed, so she can fight for the family inheritance. What about that one? That one? He's been frozen the longest. Besides, he only talks to books. Hi. I'm new here. How long have you been frozen? If You're alive, life may pass in the blink of an eye. But if you're waiting, a minute could be an eternity. Hi. I'm new here. This is for you. How long have you been frozen? What's it to you? Hey, where are you going? Wait for me! Where are you going? Wait for me! What do you want from me? I'm just looking around. It's so quiet here. No one comes here. You hang out here by yourself? I like quiet places. What is this? The outside world. Miss, your order is ready. Hi, I'd like a tuna sandwich and iced milk tea. Tuna sandwich and iced milk tea. Would you like to add an egg? - Yes. - Miss would like to add an egg. An egg! 3, 2, 1. Exhale and relax. Inhale... Exhale... The outside world. Forehead gently to the floor. Breathe gently. Breathe deeply. Practice focusing. Practice being calm. Feel inside your body... that other life. Waiting is our most important task. Looks like there's something on her face. That's the wind. Wind? She looks really happy. Wind must be a great thing. Yes, I must check out this world. Congratulations. Tests don't show any signs of relapse. Not bad. Doesn't look like there's any problems. So? Had time to find a girlfriend lately? Work's been so busy. Where would I find the time? Still using work as an excuse? Not every girl wants to have children. Apart from having children, you are completely healthy now. You can do anything. Don't you know? I'm not planning to marry or have kids anyway. Table 13's salad is ready. - OK. - OK, thanks. Table 5: ravioli, pork chop and steamed fish. - OK. - Got it. A-Shi, I know some of the girls out there. Go introduce yourself later. No need. Don't be such a bore, OK? Seriously, they're pretty and have nice bodies. They work at a bank. Very classy too. Why don't you go for it? Steamed fish is ready. Steamed fish is ready, Table 8! Coming. - What do you say? - Huh? Don't be like this. Stop nagging me, it's so annoying! - What do you want to say to Mommy? - I love you! Give her a kiss. You won't believe it. We have a chef here today. His cooking tastes 20,000 times better than yours. - You're so mean! - Yo! Wow, what a handsome chef. We're about to eat. Hanging up now, bye! Yay! Yay! Boss, is my coffee ready? Ready. Thanks. Where's the lady who came you with last time? We broke up. Don't you like her any more? What can I do? Girls don't like me. I'll help you think of something. You can help me? Yeah. But I think you're scared. Curly, time for your snack. Daddy, Uncle A-Shi got dumped again! You can love anyone you want. I don't know what you're afraid of. Life. It can get very annoying. But a second later, you'll feel that everything is so goddamn worth it. - Hey, what are you doing? - But I want to play with this. - Who wants to play with what? - This. Let her play with it. Hey! It's so cold here! Sorry for making you stay in such a cold place. I'm going to get you out of here soon. Wait for me! Miss. Miss. You want to sit in there? It's cool. No thanks. Pretty girl, but seems retarded. It's like I can sense him. Although I can't see him, I can feel his existence. It's like having a new loved one in this world. An invisible friend. So touching. I think it's spooky. Even I want to do it now. Can you get me a discount? The point is you have to find your egg's father, so they have a chance of being born, or else they'll just end up like a frozen dumpling. Just a dumpling? Mei-pao is very popular. Oh, the supermarket manager asked me yesterday if you broke up with your boyfriend. Seriously? Sir, here is your grilled fish. Thank you. This restaurant took me a long time to get a reservation. All their dishes are amazing. I've been reading the 2020 Asia frozen foods market study. Do you know the first person to sell frozen foods? Let me tell you. In 1930, there was a person named Birdseye. He once went to the North Pole and met Eskimos. The Eskimos taught him how to preserve food. Oh... During World War II, as they didn't have enough tin cans, people wrapped food in cellophane and froze it. And it became accidentally popular! In 1970, supermarkets in Iceland began selling loose frozen items, like fish. Then in the mid-1970s... Are you really going to keep talking? This salmon roe is delicious. Want some? It's OK, you have it. Did you wash your hands after the toilet? Your... Face... Has... A... Has... I just remembered I forgot to turn off the stove. Excuse me, I have to go. Excuse me. You can serve the dessert now. What's your book about? It's about the outside world. Any good? Being human is a hassle. Let me ask you. Do you sometimes suddenly get a very strange feeling here? It's like... empty. That's loneliness. You only feel that once you get to a certain age. Congratulations. You've grown up. You... It's you. You are? Your mama. Why are you swearing at me? I'm not swearing. I really am your mother. It really is you! I think about you all the time. Every time I see a chicken egg, I think of you. So you're coming to take me away from here? Not yet. What's that look supposed to mean? I want to be born soon. How can I do that without a man? Hurry up and find one. You think it's easy to find a man to love? Is it hard? You're blaming me, aren't you? - I'm not. - You are. - I'm not. - You are. I'm not. You are! Your expression says you blame me! You're such an annoying woman. You have no idea how crap men are these days. I just met a super crap one today. Stuck up as hell. So what if you know how to cook? I should've smashed his head in with my frozen buns. Life is hard. You have to work, you have to love. You also have to be yourself. And everyone around you will keep asking: How come you're not married yet? How come you don't have kids yet? If you don't hurry, it'll be too late! Darn! I already know, I don't need you to tell me. I don't want to be a human any more. What's wrong with you? Your mother doesn't want to live any more. Don't be like that. If you die, I don't get born. Who doesn't want to be happy? I want to be happy too. But it's so hard. Work a little harder. Work a little harder. Work harder. Work a little harder. Work a little harder. Work a little harder. How are the roast vegetables going? - Preparing them now. - Okay. Hey! Look after this for me. I told you I don't make frozen foods. I grew up in a single-parent family. My father ran off when I was born. My mom worked multiple jobs to take care of me. I'm going for a smoke. She did direct marketing, sold insurance. She was so busy. She wasn't at home much. But she's very particular about what her kid eats. So is this a romance or action film? I can't tell either. So what? Lucky we had a freezer. My mother bought a big fridge. Every weekend, she'd get up even earlier than usual and buy a whole bunch of stuff at the markets, then spend all afternoon in the kitchen. Because of those frozen foods, I never felt like I had less than other kids. Get a curry from the fridge, microwave 3 minutes. Then just pour it on top of the rice. Be careful to not get burned. Though she was hardly home, I was still able to eat her cooking every day. Every time I opened the freezer, I'd see all these packets of hard, frozen food. It made me feel at ease, unafraid. That's all I have to say. Bye. She's gone. Show's over. Emotional drama. She's probably crying. No wonder you turned down my offer, sly devil. You can all come out now. She's gone. Coming. Hurry up, we've still got work to do. Please don't look down on frozen foods. There are actually lots of people who don't have any time to cook. Or have no money to go to restaurants. But they still want to eat a hot meal. Frozen foods aren't as worthless as you think. For a lot of people, they are very important. It's a great invention that can preserve our love. Time to eat. Hello? Breakfast? Breakfast! Chef's special breakfast. Yay. Pepper. Salt. May I? It's so delicious. Cooking with fresh ingredients means you've already won half the battle. All I do is bring out the food's original flavor. If only frozen foods can taste this good. Let's try make frozen food as tasty as fresh food, so they can also experience that original flavor. Did you just say "let's"? Let's. Miss, I haven't agreed to working with you. Don't be like this. I'm going to write up a business proposal tonight. The egg egg egg yolk's leaking! - Sorry. - Ah! This is my secret base. It used to be a garbage dump. It took me a year to clear out the garbage. And another 6 months to cultivate the land. Then after that I started planting vegetables. I noticed that, the shorter the distance to the restaurant, the closer the food gets to your heart. Smells so good. This is rosemary. I use it to braise meat. It's also very good for making flavoring oil. This is marigold. Smell the flower. This is different. What is it? I'll take you to see my 28-day aged beef. Be careful. I only air the beef after I get it from overseas. Other places get beef after it's been air-dried, but the flavor is much better if do it here. Did you just close the door? Yeah, otherwise the air conditioning will get out. Oops. I forgot to tell you. This door can't be opened from the inside. Is anyone there? Hey! Is anyone there? Hey! I'm going to freeze to death. I'm going to freeze to death. Don't worry so much. We have enough food to last a week. I never thought my life would become a tale of regrets. You have a lot of regrets? Quite a lot. For example? For example... I haven't found my happiness yet. What kind of happiness do you want? I'm still not sure myself. I've often wondered since I was little. If my mother didn't have me, would her life have been freer and happier? I know because she had to look after me, she gave up a lot of happiness she could have had. So perhaps it's finding the right person. Actually, children aren't even necessary for a couple to have a happy life together. I don't really know either... Come here. Do you have any regrets in life? I don't think so. How's that possible? I just had a great breakfast, and right now I'm holding a beautiful girl. What's there to regret? Aw... I kissed someone. When? Just then. Yay! Awesome! What's he like? His... His eyes go all squinty when he smiles. So cute. He's got such a high-bridged nose. His hair... gets really messy sometimes, but he looks so hot. When I think about him, even though it's cold, I feel really warm inside. Besides, I'm not scared to be trapped here, because you're here with me. Plus he's a great kisser. So I'm going to be born soon! Hey, I haven't even thought about that yet. Hey, hurry up. All right. I'm going to be born. So sleepy... I'm taking a nap. But you haven't finished. Hey, don't fall asleep. Don't sleep. I'm so sleepy, let me sleep. Don't sleep. Don't fall asleep. Don't sleep, you can't sleep. You can't sleep. Must have been freezing. Here, coffee. Thank you. It's very hot. We nearly turned into your hated frozen foods. Quick! - What's are you doing? - Hey! Hi. What's up with you? I just wanted to see what you're up to. Let's try sesame oil chicken fried rice first. Sesame oil chicken fried rice. Otherwise, this looks pretty good too. Quick, open it up. Otherwise let's try the simplest: dumplings. Who's on the cover? - No idea. - Executive Head Chef. I wonder what rain on the face feels like. Can we go take a look at your fridge? My place? My mother made all of this. There's curry at the top, fried rice and stir-fried noodles at the bottom. Plus some herbal health soup. My mom loves to make a whole bunch of food and bring it to my place to cram my fridge. After I got a chance to eat out more, I realized my mom's cooking is... actually just OK. But I guess I'm just used to it. Familiarity is comfort. Ladies and gentlemen. I trust you all have wonderful mothers. When picking ingredients, they always choose the best. Even if it's just washing vegetables, they'll wash diligently to ensure they're clean. And they'll never use any harmful additives. The dishes may be simple, but the flavors are always beautiful. Our new line of products will make everyone feel the care of their mothers. I would now like to introduce to everyone the hottest chef of the moment, who helped us develop these new products and make our products more flavorsome and tasty. This time I didn't attempt any challenging dishes. I simply chose a few familiar family dishes and tried to make them taste as good as freshly made. I used to be really against frozen foods, so I have to thank someone. She made me realize something very important: Whether you have time or not, have money or not, everybody deserves a good meal. This is frozen food. Really can't tell. Huge success! Mei-pao, you did great. - Good job. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Whose glass is this? I don't care. That speech was so moving. I nearly cried, my God. - You cry at everything. - I'm gonna eat the leftovers back there. You're that hungry? Excuse me, are you still open? I'm from Good For You Frozen Foods. We want to collaborate with your boss, but I hear he hates frozen food. I'm going to be born! I'm going to be born! I'm going to be born! Don't they get tired? Those two are basically big kids. They've been buddies since high school. But then Phil and I started having kids, and A-Shi got sick, so we drifted apart. He was sick? He's fine now. A-Shi has always liked to cook, and his restaurant is doing better and better, but he's always so busy he doesn't have a life. So I often tell Phil to invite him out more. Oh. He's actually really good with kids. But for some reason he says he hates children. You never bring girls here with you. What's different this time? The first time I saw her, a strange feeling came up inside me. It's like I'd been waiting for her all my life. This is called love at first sight, OK? She once said to me that you don't need to have children to be happy. That was the moment I felt, I was qualified to love her. I'm so afraid that whoever loves me will regret it. This is not bad. Thinking of settling down? Hey, everyone's asleep. You can come out now. I think my mom found the right person. So... I'm going to be leaving soon. No wonder... you've been in such a good mood. Later, if you are also born, and we met in the outside world, would you still recognize me? I doubt I would. Then let's have a secret code. Secret code? Remember, if you're walking down the street, and suddenly someone comes up to you and says, "Come with me, I have something to say to you," then that person is me. "Come with me, I have something to say to you." Like this. Come with me. I have something to say to you. You're so naive. You're really stupid. I'm stupid? Think about it. If your mom can have kids, then what does she need you for? We've always just been a back-up plan. You're saying, my mom's in love, but I shouldn't be happy? What's there to be happy about? The day she finds happiness could be the day you're abandoned. Abandoned... They're all like that. I met a pretty good guy recently. Oh really? Congratulations. But... I have a small question. Ask ahead. It's that... If I end up getting pregnant naturally, what will happen to the egg I froze earlier? Isn't it just like cooking? If you already have fresh, why use frozen? Why can't I get pregnant? Why can other people do it but I can't? Every friend I've introduced have all had babies. Every single one! We can't guarantee success every time. I'm not going to let this go. Sorry. Thanks. Wasn't last summer the hottest ever recorded in Taipei? My ex-boyfriend and I had decided to go somewhere really, really cold. I ended up buying the tickets and a new jacket, and even found a hotel made of ice. But we never ended up going. Then let's go! Huh? Life's too short. Why hesitate? I'm going to buy a new jacket! Thank you. Take that! It's freezing. I'm getting in the car. I want to be in it too. Where are off to? To Hawaii! Not taking passengers today! Wait. Don't look at this, don't look at this. Frozen foods! Why are you getting so many? Poisoned by your job? I'm dedicated. - So this is deer milk cheese? - Deer milk cheese. Eating it will make you go "Oh dear". It's all made of ice! This place is too cool. Never thought I'd really come here. Thank you. Ever since you came along, everything has changed. Perhaps... I can... start a family with him. Have a baby. When he holds me, it's as though the happiness I imagined is right before my eyes. Sorry. Please forgive me. I love you. So... there's no chance of me being born? Yay! Hello. What are you doing here? Making a snowman? Do you wanna come and play with us? What's wrong? I had a dream. What dream? I have this recurring dream, where a big white ball is weighing on my chest. I can't breathe but I can't get rid of it. I think a voice is calling me, but I can't hear it clearly. After I woke up, I'm left with a feeling... like I've wronged someone. I had a dream too. There's something I haven't told you. Have you heard of egg freezing? Egg freezing? I did it. Oh... Sometimes I would dream that it is living in a very, very cold place. It actually looks a lot like here. Do you really want to have children? When you meet someone you love, you should, right? Don't you want to? You want a boyfriend just so you can have a baby? If so, we didn't have to come all this way and waste each other's time. Waste each other's time? I don't understand what you're talking about. Stop lying to yourself. What love? You're just looking for sperm. Why do I suddenly feel like I don't know you? You're right, you don't know me. I'm telling you, I'm not getting married and I'm not having children. Why are you so mad I got my eggs frozen? Is there a need to get so angry? Did you forget? I told you before. I hate frozen food! I think it's the most pathetic thing in the world! Pathetic? So now you're saying I'm pathetic? You're always like this. Looking so aggrieved and innocent all the time, but you never realize how much you hurt people. What are you doing here? I've always been here. I screwed things up again. I don't know how things turned out like this. I just really want to love someone, but for some reason it always fails. What did I do wrong? It's not your fault. Don't worry. You still have me. I won't leave you. Am I never going to be happy? You're such an annoying woman. Let's wait together. Happiness will surely come. It's lucky I found her, it was so dark, I nearly hit her with my car. It's so cold, she could have frozen to death. - Do you want some coffee? - Sure. It's really cold outside. I don't understand people who go outside now. Take that you gopher! Girls can count on boys. I'm going to do something very important. I'm a little nervous. I need courage now more than ever. I'm going to propose to her. What are you doing? I'm filming you. - It's really pretty over there. Let's go. - Is it? - OK. - Your present! What is love? Love is like a symptom. It's a symptom that can happen at any stage in life. Once the symptoms begin, it means there's someone who makes you full of infatuation, full of desire. You'll desire to be with them every day, even for the rest of your life. Don't bother her. I told you couples shouldn't travel together. Then, there will also be some side effects. For instance, an exaggerated sense of joy and loss could hit you at the same time. You may make some irrational promises, or say some childish things. As soon as the symptom disappears, it will seem like melancholy and complaint are the only things left. That's love. The owner is really popular right now. - Really? - Popular? Why? He got his own frozen food brand. What we're eating right now isn't frozen food, is it? No way. I think it's hard to say. Right? You never know these days. - This isn't a cheap meal. - No way. I had to book this place a month in advance. It's a scam. The higher the price, the more he makes. What's wrong with frozen food? As if your stinky mouths can tell the difference. Who are you? - Take it easy. - Stinky mouths? What's your problem? You're full of yourself because you own a restaurant? Got your own brand? Hey! Bye. See ya. These are our company's new products. I've put them in the freezer for you. Remember to eat them. The taste is not bad. Nice and sweet. Mei-pao, the other day I saw on TV this new technology that can freeze a woman's eggs. They can take it out when you want to use it. It's like brand new after they defrost it. I've done it already. Oh, then you need to remember. Remember the use-by date, don't let it expire. You can keep it for 10 years. 10? Even if you had 20 years yours will still expire. Whatever. Look, the presentation still has room for improvement. Let me tell you something. Three months ago, I went for a full body health check. They found a small growth in my uterus. It's not a big problem. I've already arranged the operation and recovery period. So... I might be a busy recently. I just can't make food for you for a while. You can't send someone until tomorrow? What about the stuff in my fridge? It's not that. There's a lot of food my mom made for me in here. Stir-fried noodles and curry rice. Hey, I trusted you guys! Isn't your fridge supposed to preserve my food? Hey. What are you still doing here? Didn't you say you were going to be born? Yes. Weren't you going to be born? I'm going to be born! I'm going to be born! Not anymore? Poor thing. Your mother must be hopeless. Yeah, who knows how much longer? Who knows how long you'll have to wait? Go mommy! Go mommy! - What? - None of your business! Am I wrong? Stop fighting. So? Are you OK? Fighting is a form of learning too. Have a drink with me. Goodbye. I've been frozen for 10 years, but there's still no chance to be born. Tonight is my last night. Waiting won't necessarily result in anything. That's life. Farewell. But remember, the most important thing is to have hope. You're only alive if you have hope. A-Shi. The sauce is ready. OK. Get me some dried chili peppers. - Over here. - Thanks. Credit card bill, phone bill, invitations. And there's these. They've sent it heaps of times. I'm going. OK. You've got a meeting at 10 tomorrow morning. OK, I know. Goodnight. PAYMENT NOTICE Darn. It's so hot. What's going on? Are you OK? It's me. Are you busy? No. I just had a really weird dream. It's making me feel really uncomfortable. I feel like I must go take a look. It's like someone's calling out for help. Are you OK? What happened? - I don't know. - It's so hot. No one can take it any more. The glass door is broken. It's so hot. Let's get out of here. Mei-pao! I can't breathe. Stay here with me. OK? Stay here with me. What are you doing here? If I can't be happy then no one can. I'll go take a look. - I've destroyed them all. - Wait! They are people's hopes and dreams. Do you think what you've done is fair? Fair? Fair? Who has been fair to me? I underwent procedure after procedure. I only found out last week. He already had a baby with another woman. Don't be scared. I'll stay here with you. I can't breathe. Stay here with me, OK? Stay here with me. Actually, I've already been here for a long time. I knew long ago I'd never get a chance to see the outside world. I envy you so much. You can still hope. I'm not even qualified to hope... Let's... Let's wait together... A-Shi. There's something I never got a chance to tell you. It's a shame. I'll never know what wind blowing on my face or sun shining on my skin feels like. Or what holding someone's hand while walking down the street feels like. It's raining. A-Shi. Every life is precious. Whenever there's a chance, I think you should cherish it, protect it. I'll cook something. She must be a great cook. My favorite was her curry. This is where you grew up. Yeah. When I got home after school each day, I would sit here, doing my homework while eating dinner. You mother's? I really wish I could have gotten to know her. I'll check what's in the fridge. I love this taste. I've loved it since I was little. Sorry. I almost chose to abort you. I was so young at the time. I was scared. I didn't know how I would make it alone. When I think about my life, I don't know if it's a success or a failure. I toyed with men. Toyed with a few. Maybe hurt a couple of them. Sometimes I think my life should have no regrets. But for some reason, I sometimes also wonder, just what did I leave behind? Why do I feel an emptiness? Lucky I had you. Every time I saw you happy in love, or sad from heartbreak, I realized how fortunate I was to have had the courage to give birth to you. Thank you, baby. Remember. You have to remember the taste of Mom. I miss her so much. I miss my mom so much. Maybe what I was truly afraid of was going through life without leaving anything behind. But now I know I definitely will. Love always leaves something behind. Stop hiding. Someone just paid your storage fees and extended the contract. So... someone's waiting for me. There's something I never got a chance to tell you. Usually when we do such an operation, we would ask the patient if they want to store their sperm. At the time you said no. But... I thought it would have been a shame. You're still so young, so handsome, smart, and youhave a good personality. So at the time I thought, perhaps... I wanted to help you preserve a possibility. It's stored at my friend's clinic. I've arranged all your food. I'm putting it all in the freezer, and Phil will come every day to feed and walk you. Mei-pao. Do you want to go to a very, very cold place? It's so strange. When I laid eyes on you for the first time, I felt like I already knew you. Look, it's so beautiful. Come with me, I have something to say to you. What? Guess.
