Row out further! You scare my fish from the shore! Well it's true! So poorly raised! I can't stand inconsiderate people. Are they BITING?!!! Pierre, step back! You're scaring the fish as well. Go see mommy! Did you hear me? What is it Pierrot? Not having any fun? What's wrong? You seem so sad. - I'm sad for the fish. - The fish? Doesn't it hurt them to be pulled from the water? Sure, of course. Sadly, many things can cause hurt. But you're too young to hear this. There then, run along and play. Follow that pretty butterfly. My fish! Now you've done it! Marcel! Come on, Marcel! That's right, side with him, impair my authority. You see the result? - A day's work lost! - Come on, this is Sunday play! So I work all week, yet I can't have fun on Sundays? Of course you can. So I must endure while he spoils everything? Now apologize! - Marcel. - You be quiet! Apologize or I'll spank you! - You're beastly! - Ah, standing up to me? - Then here! - I forbid you to hit him! I'm allowed to correct my own child, no? Pierre! What's happening? Don't worry, I caught him. He's not hurt. Oh my lord! - He was lucky! - He's completely soaked! - My dear child! - He'll catch cold. Use this to dry him off. - Are you his father? - No. That man over there. - I owe you my thanks. - Anyone would do as much. Only, I must tell you, the child didn't fall, he jumped in the water. - Jumped? - He seems very sensitive. - You should watch him closely. - For a little slap? Ah, with these natures, a slap can do much harm. - Sir. - Goodbye, sir. - Madam, my best wishes. - Thank you so much, sir. So, now we can't hit our own kids? And a day's fishing ruined! What a Sunday! Good day, dear madam. Me, yet again. Yet again as if you disturbed us. We're always happy to see clients. I know, I'm merely a client. - However, if only... - We've received new watch fobs. Very modern, shaped like 4-leaf clovers. I've already purchased rosaries, 2 watches, 3 rings... Watch fobs might be the charm. You become lovelier every day! They're fine gold, if you'd care to choose. I'll defer to you. What a shame! You, so refined, so charming, in this tawdry shop... It's criminal. - You don't believe me? - Of course I do. How many fobs? - One? Two? - However you decide. Can you see life as you were born for? I see it clearly. A small mansion near the Bois... Mornings dressed by servants, afternoon car rides, furs... Evenings filled with music. - What do you think? - Will these 4 be enough? Make it 6. So, would you say yes? Would you accept? Alice? One second please? - May I? - Of course, dear madam. I'll wait. However long it takes. What is it now? What's wrong? This has gone on long enough. He's our best customer. I can't object to his banter. You call that banter? I'll set him straight! But Marcel! - Sir. - May I help you? I was choosing watch fobs with your saleslady. She's not my saleslady, she's my wife. Well, I have no watch fobs. - And these? - They're sold. - How about these? - Also sold. - So your shop is sold out? - Completely. - Funny way to run a business. - If you don't like it... I do say, I don't like your tone. - I despise brutes. - Looking for trouble? Please let go, don't touch me. - What if I smashed your face? - I'll repeat, please let go. Want me to throw you out? Marcel! Henri Duverrier, boxing champion. I'm sorry for you, madam. Oh Julie, that took too long! Dr. Carbonnel is on vacation. I had to find his replacement. - He's here with me. - Well show him in! Would you come in, doctor? - Dr. Marchat. - Hello, doctor. I didn't think I'd be offering my services again so soon. Your family's having some bad luck. - What happened? An accident? - Yes, my husband fell... - Against a display. - We'll see to him. How's your son? He's well. He's on vacation at his grandmother's farmhouse. Perfect. So what seems to be the problem? Hello, doctor. You bandaged him like he was decapitated! Surprising I didn't suffocate! Quiet down now, let's see. Light trauma... Good. No fractures. - Back here? - Ah! You're fine, everything's in place. There's no danger. Head injuries are either immediately fatal, - or are nothing at all. - See? You heard the doctor? I could have died! That's where idle flirting leads! How do you see this doctor? You be the judge. Some lowlife is disrespecting my wife... I intervene, and as I'm politely asking him to leave, he sucker punches me. Is that proper? Don't bore the doctor with personal stories. I'll sue him! I'll have him put in jail! Yes, of course. Don't get so excited, you'll give yourself a fever. No point in bandaging him, Better let the wound air out. Yes, doctor. - Where might I write a prescription? - This way, doctor. - Excuse me. - Thank you. Goodbye, and stay calm. Should I worry about complications, doctor? Not in the least. A harmless cut scalp that should heal in no time. All the better, I was a bit worried. Along with treatment, I'll prescribe a mild sedative. He'd do well to avoid these emotional outbursts. They aren't good for the heart. Or for those around him. It's nothing, really. Listen, doctor... By chance, you twice witnessed circumstances that were...unfortunate. I wouldn't want you to judge my husband on these two cases. He's a good man, I assure you. It's not my place as a doctor to judge my patients. I'm only here to heal them. - Here's the prescription. - Thank you, doctor. I won't need to return, my colleague Carbonnel can bring my tiny invoice upon his return. - Farewell, madam. - This way doctor. Alice! You got out of bed? Good thing too! You'd let this doctor leave without thanking him? - You'll come have lunch with us. - Well no, it's that... It's really the least I can do to show my appreciation. - I'm very moved, but... - Alice, you insist as well. Dr. Marchat's visit would highly please us. An early lunch! Now you can't get out of it! Tomorrow at 12:30, alright? Tomorrow at 12:30 then. But get back into bed. Thank you. Ah, you know Marchat, I'm so very glad we met! Even taking into account how. - Eh, Alice? - Listen... Here's the whole story: - Just this morning... - Marcel. Alice wanted to cancel she thought our invitation was bothersome. The ideas women get! - I'll bet you're a bachelor. - Yes. You're on the right side of things. Never get married. It's always the same here, as soon as I make a friend, my wife drives them away. Darn, another customer. - I'll go. - No, my turn, you stay. You seem annoyed, does my presence bother you? Yesterday I felt you didn't want me to visit. Rest assured, it's the last time I'll impose. No, I feared our company, being neither witty nor merry would not afford you any enjoyment. So I hesitated to receive you. Well you were mistaken, I've had a very pleasant time. - Really? - Very much so. In that case, please visit whenever you'd like. Thank you. - Are you a musician? - Yes! Well, a little. I was before. But now that I'm married... That's a shame. Why? Just the way it goes. Yes, I understand you. But why not go out more? You should try and enjoy yourself. I don't know, for example Sundays... Why not go to the concerts? My husband prefers fishing. - Every Sunday? - Every Sunday. - Of course. - But I do have my son. - He's delightful. - Yes, I know. He looks like you in every way. Thank you. Say Marchat, you know what you should do? Come spend Sunday with us! We'll go fishing! What do you say? Alice! Be careful! When pedaling uphill, your foot's too far up the pedal, it's tiring and inefficient. Push with your toes, watch me! In sports, I know about style! You see? - Are you hurt? - Nothing broken? No, it's nothing, my chain dropped. The handlebar is a bit loose also. These brake pads are crooked, but it's nothing. - Need a hand? - No thanks. You'd only get in my way. Go on ahead. - We could wait. - No need. As you like, then. - We'll stop over at the dances. - I'll catch up before that! - See you later. - See you soon! What will you have? Beer, ap?ritif, lemonade? - Have you nothing finer? - Well, you could have champagne. - Fine, but pricey. 20F a bottle. - One please, well chilled. Yes sir, right away. - This may not be reasonable. - Why not? Firstly, it's expensive, and second, inappropriate. How is it different from drinking tea or beer? I don't know. You're quite right, it's the same. To our having met! - Any good? - Yes. - You like it? - Very much. - Why are you laughing? - Because you're enchanting! - You look like a little girl. - Don't exaggerate. - Do you dance? - Before yes, I adored the ball. But now... What are they playing? A new dance called the tango. - You dance the tango? - Well, yes. You seem outraged. Why? - They say it's a bit racy... - Oh, I assure it isn't. - Who told you this? - My husband. He's never seen it danced. Come, you'll see it's simple, and so very decent. - I don't know the steps. - No matter, just follow my lead. You fared wonderfully for your first tango. With such a great dancer, I only needed to follow. Why are you staring at me like that? How could you ever marry a man like Roland? It happened... Almost by a fluke. My parents were poor, Father died, I had to work, then I met Roland. He seemed a good man. There you go. Now I'm 25 years old. What a mess! - You're here? - Yes. - Well, better luck next time. - Thank you. Goodbye. Git up, girl. Have you seen a young lady with a man dressed in blue? - They were here, but they left. - Left how? - Their bikes are still there. - Maybe they went for a walk. I'll try to find them. Sir? Sir? They're sitting over there. Oh my, what a job! There had to be a defect, I needed to figure it out. I have an eye for detail. Nothing gets past me! It's still quite nice to have a fortune. When I compare your rooms to ours... That's some thing to say! Your home is lovely. Nice to say, but I'm not deceived. I've less money, less schooling, less intelligence... I wonder what draws you towards me. What about friendship, dummy? You're a good guy, Marchat. We're for better or for worse. I'm counting on it. Haha, I think I 'm starting a run. You can sit down. I'm on top of my game. 12. Well... Let me know when you finish. This could be a while. 13! 14! I can't take it anymore. Same here, I've had enough. 15! Oh, you're on fire today! Be strong, my dear. Come tomorrow, we'll talk it out. - Missed it! - No luck. Your turn! On top of that, I left you an easy point. Missed! My luck is back! My turn again! - You're leaving? - Yes, going shopping. Goodbye Marchat. Shopping again? It seems you're shopping often lately. Where will you be? Galeries Lafayette, for underwear, is that enough detail? - Don't be home too late. - I'll be on time to make your supper. Why are you looking at me like that? - Marchat, you're my friend aren't you? - Why yes, of course. - I can count on you? - Naturally. Then listen, it's about Alice. - Alice? - No idea what's with her lately, but - I'm sure she's hiding something. - Alice? Yes. You can't believe that. - Maybe she's sick. - Sick? No, just look at her. I think she just misses Pierre. - A simple reason. - You think? I'm sure of it. You're right. I'll send for the kid! What would I do without you? Really... You can't imagine the place you've taken in my life. The only cloud is, I wish Alice would be kinder to you. - She's very kind. - Still, not as kind as I'd like. I think she may envy our friendship. What is it, Prosper? A patient is waiting for you in your office. - Very well. On my way. - I'll leave you then. Naturally, you're dining with us tomorrow? - Naturally. - Goodbye. Goodbye. How? It's you? I can't go on. - I'm at wit's end, I'm drowning. - Oh, my love. We need a solution. If you love me, take me away. I haven't the strength to go on. Watching every word, every gesture, hiding like criminals... - It's beyond my strength. - Have patience, my dear. Understand that I love you, Henri. When I'm not in your arms, you stand alone, free to think of me, to breathe perfume I leave behind, to laugh, remembering your joy. But me? What is my life when you're not there? Can't you see? I must smile, talk, feign to be alive? Even as all my body and heart cries out for you? That's only in the daytime, there's also... Be quiet. Be quiet. You're right. We'll take the train tonight. - Really? - C?te d'Azur by tomorrow, I'll write your husband from there. - We'll take Pierre with us. - My dear! - But how will you explain to him? - I won't need to. He already understands his father is incapable of raising him. - I'll go get him tomorrow. - We'll leave immediately. Hello? Hello? Should I put these bags on the train? No, wait for the others, they should be here soon. Hello? Hello? Is that you, Prosper? Yes. Say... Is... What? I can't hear you very well. Yes! Let me speak to him. If you please. Hello, Marchat? Don't leave, I need to speak with you. I'm so flustered I'm using the formal vous! My wife begs you not to leave. Come quickly to the house. It's dreadful. But what happened? Tell me! The boy came home indisposed last night, now he's very sick. Hurry, I'm begging you. Keep your wits about you, I'm on my way. Yes, right away. My darling. Open your mouth. Stick out your tongue and say ahhh. - Ah. - No, ahhh. It's diphtheria. My god. Alice, be brave, we'll save him, I promise you. The three of us will save him. Here. No go play. Give me your gloves. Don't get wet, you're still not 100%. Sure he is, don't worry. He's completely recovered. So... What have you decided? - About what? - Please! You wanted to wait until Pierre was better. Now he is. When are we leaving? Alice. I'm leaving France for you! We decided together I'd accept this job in Indochina. Now I can't back out, and you're hesitating. What's going on? Listen... Pierre's illness taught me something. Roland loves his son. He's so inept, it hides even his better qualities. I thought him uncaring, and even callous towards Pierre. Then when I saw him fall apart during the illness - I changed my mind. - Ah, you've changed it. Pierre can't ever blame me for taking him away from his father. Alice, you know what this means? My dear. - You could separate us? - I can't imagine it! Well then, we have a right to our own lives! Pierre's a child, he'll have forgotten in 10 years, then... No, you see through a man's eyes. A child doesn't forget his father. I may be weak, cowardly... Could these sudden newfound misgivings - be just an excuse? - An excuse? Yes. Sobered by these 2 months, you no longer love me? How can say such things to me? You're compelling me to. Look at me. If you only knew how painful it was to realize I can't follow you! The past 60 days and endless nights, pacing my room like a caged animal. I didn't dare speak to you, hoping against hope, for a miracle. Then I'd tell myself our happiness was paramount while understanding it was hopeless. I have no right to leave with you. - And I have no right to stay! - Oh no, don't leave me. - What will I become without you? - If you won't come, I leave alone. - No! - Yes. There. You'll need to decide! Henri! Some years have passed... - Pierre. - Mom! Hug your Dr. Pierre Roland, graduate with high honors! - I'm so happy! - As am I! Dr. Pierre Roland, at home daily between 2 and 6 o'clock. The neighbors will be impressed at the sign on my door reading: Dr. Roland. You'll be proud of me? I surely will. Life can be unfair, but every once in a while... We come out on top. - Why say such a thing? - For nothing. Let's telegram your father. - Will you be dining with me? - Naturally, why ask? You might have had other plans. No, with a mother like you, there's no better company! Here they come. Hello, Alice. Hello, my dear Jean. - Not too tired? - We slept on the train. - My dear doctor. - Greetings, Jean. Ah, you haven't heard! Our lawyer's first day as Justice of the Peace! - No? - He did splendidly. I invited everyone, naturally, it really went well. - He's going places, this Jean fella. - Pierre too, you know. Quite true, congrats my son, I'm happy for you. It took some doing. Painter, engineer, you dipped into everything except, your medicine, now committed, it's up to you to kill as many as your brother will defend. Just a sec, I'm doing experiments. Mr. Marescot! Mr. Marescot! Hand me a swig of your potions. I don't feel well. Mr. Marescot! Mr. Marescot! Have you formulated the Fountain of Youth? You're losing your edge! Coucou. Oh, Pierre! You stupid jerk! I should've known it was you. A homecoming for you? You're moving back here to open an office. I wish! It's just so expensive. Well father Roland must have a few pennies set aside, no? Not as much as they say. My parents are just getting by. They do own the villa and some land in the city, but that's all. - Another client. - Stay there, I'll go. May I help you, miss? - I spend time at the beach and... - Need to tan quickly? - How did you know? - I'm a know-it-all. Wait a sec, let's see... Tanning lotion... Ah, there it is. Here, miss... Apply 30 minutes before sunbathing, then 8 days later, Negresses will go pale with envy. - How much? - For you, let's say 18F. 18F, there. Thank you very much. Now if you'd like to be yellow, green, orange, or red - I have everything you need. - Thanks. - So now then, krikou. - Pardon me? Krikou. It's Samoyedic. - Ah, because you speak Samoyedic? - Me? Not at all, only that one word. What does it mean? It means: I have no advice to offer, It's none of my business, but if I were a redhead like you I wouldn't change a thing as it suits you quite well. - You're the strangest pharmacist. - I'm not even a pharmacist. - Then what are you? - Doctor. It's even funnier. When I find a plump healthy patient, I attack him, pull him to the ground and when he's lying almost dead, I send him to a pharmacist to finish him off. - Well that's rather merry! - It's very krikou. - Do you ever go to the beach? - No. I love the fish too much. All those people splashing into their homes, it drives the poor things crazy! Imagine if whales rained down on our streets! We'd be very upset! That's a shame, I would have liked you to meet my friends. Well, you never know. Goodbye, miss. Goodbye. Hello. Nice of you to come. I was in the neighborhood. So how goes the rotisserie? You're getting dark. I'm thinking it's far enough. You're right, it's more elegant that way. How do you like our little beach? Pleasant, isn't it? I find it's very krumak. That's Hottentot. - It means... - No, don't start that again! I'll introduce you to the crew. Perk up a bit, I brought you a medical celebrity. Doctor... What is your name, anyway? - Pierre! - Jean! Isn't this something! - You know each other? - I should say...he's my brother! Those poor little fish, how they must suffer. But the water is warm. Aren't you tempted? Pierre, don't worry, if you drown we'll fish you out! It's kind of you, but I can't swim. I'd be in the way. That's no way to think. - We could teach you. - No, I'd look foolish. And, I only enjoy doing what I can do well. Oh my! You're so very complicated! Off with you you kids! Have a nice time! - Goodbye. - See you tonight! See you later mom, goodbye! She's very sweet, she would make a great little missus. Maybe so. I asked around, her dowry is flush, this could be good for Jean. What do you think? It could be just as good for Pierre. Ah Pierre... We never know what's on his mind. As guarded as his mother. He's your son in every sense. The woman he loves will be very happy. - If she can understand him. - Jean will also make a good husband. For now, my advice is to let time decide. We risk making 2 people unhappy, if not 3. - Oh, the lovely apples! - Want some? Easy, halt! Stop right here. What are you doing? Louise wants apples, we must oblige! - You won't climb over I hope? - Why not? Pierre, come back down! You may not realize, you're breaking the law. No harm done, it's for rent. We're checking it out, that's all. - Coming, Louise? - Absolutely! Louise, don't follow that fool, come down from there. If we did things your way, we'd never have any fun! Look at this one. - Here. - Thanks. We're just like Adam and Eve! Sure, with a bit more clothing! - It's quite lovely. - Yes. Pierre, Louise... - Come quick! - Should we listen to him? - It might be serious. - Too bad, we were in paradise. Ever notice, whenever we find a quiet place, someone bothers us. Don't be sad, we'll come back someday. - Promise me? - I Promise! What is it, why call out? Hide, it's Bonnardel the notary. So what? So what? So he might have seen. A family friend, imagine that! Keep stressing out like that and you won't live long! C'mon Louise, hop! - Hello dear Master. - Mr. Roland. - Hello, Master. - My compliments. Please sit Master Bonnardel. It's been ages since your last visit. To what do we owe the pleasure? Well then... I've been charged by Master Fernet, a Parisian colleague, to take steps in a case. - Steps? - Official steps, yes. No, don't be alarmed. Tell me, do you know, or have you known a person called Marchat, Henri? Goodbye Jean, Goodbye Pierre. See you soon. He cured Pierre of diphtheria, then left for Indochina. In 1914, he returned for the draft. We saw him again, he'd take his leaves at home. You know how it goes, peace came, we retired here, Marchat returned to Indochina, and we lost track of each other. No, no, please stay. Bonnardel brings news of Marchat. Hello Master. What has become of him? Nothing bad I hope. Well, since Mr. Marchat was a friend, I'm afraid I have sad news. He has died, 2 months ago. In Saigon. Poor old friend. So sad to die that far away. I advised not to go. Jean's younger, but Pierre must remember Marchat? You know, it's hazy. How did you hear of it? I told you! Master Fernet, who seeks you for the inheritance. Inheritance? Yes, Dr. Marchat made Jean his sole beneficiary. It's a large inheritance, with 200,000F of income. - 200,000F of income? - Yes. Isn't that something! Alice, do you realize? - Jean, I'm so happy for you. - I'm speechless! Friends like him are hard to find! 200,000F of income? Well then Jean, you're set! - Then you'll accept the inheritance? - I'd imagine so! - No problems? Lawsuits? Debts? - No, rest assured. Bring Jean to my offices tomorrow for the reading of the will. Happily! You've brought great joy to our home! Marcel. - I'm sorry, I'm overwhelmed. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - See you tomorrow. - Goodbye. - My compliments, young man. Jean, Pierre, show Bonnardel out. With pleasure. There's a story, I never expected this! What do you think, Alice? We must consider Pierre also. Pierre? He wasn't as fortunate. You might sell the city land so he can get established. Not sell my land? What about us? Pierre mustn't be unfairly disadvantaged! - Don't you agree? - I'll think on it. We'll discuss it later. If we had known the day we met Marchat on the banks of the Marne! - Do you remember? - Yes. Life can be so sweet sometimes! 24. This Dr. Marchat, you knew him too? Yes, a little. Isn't it strange he left you nothing? I would have split my fortune between both brothers. He thought otherwise. Well within his rights. - But it'll create problems. - Why? Well, I don't know... But it'll create problems. A delicious dinner. My dear friends! My dear friends, and to you my dear Jean, I'm overjoyed on this occasion, surrounding you with your family, and your friends. In life... There are the fortunate, and those less so. I've had good fortune! You're following in my footsteps! Bravo! Dear father, dear mother, my dear friends, I'm pleased at what's happening, I cannot deny, but I wouldn't want to be alone in my happiness. I have news. News which should please you Pierre. After talking with my father, I've put in a trust, a sum that will allow you to set up a medical practice. Master Bonnardel here has received my instructions. I pray you will accept this token of my affection. Thank you Jean, It's kind to think of me. But I will not accept. I wish to make my own career... and owe nothing but to my own effort. But Pierre! I only thought to please you. Blast all this! This was a beautiful gift! Your brother shows kindness, and this is your answer? I'll tell you what I think! - You're acting like... - Marcel! You're right. We'll settle this later. A bit of advice, father. You shouldn't drink this much. Your health is delicate, you know. Right now, your nerves are fraying, your stomach is irritated, you're working towards a stroke. - You're kidding, right? - Not the least bit. Look in a mirror, you're congested. Your eyes are bloodshot. Be careful. These doctors are all the same! If we listened, we'd never have any fun. That's my point, commander. I'd be a bad son and doctor if I acted otherwise. Ladies, gentlemen... Please excuse me, I have much work early tomorrow. Good evening. - I don't know what came over him. - Just a little edgy. Do I seem congested? - Hardly at all. - It was a kind gesture to make. I don't understand it. Come in. I saw light under your door. - Can't sleep? - No. - Have the others left? - A long while ago. - Your brother and father are in bed. - Those fake-friendly get-togethers with polite bows and speechifying, I can't stand them. They noticed, you know. You weren't very polite. What can I say? It's how I am. You're such a pig-head! Will you never lose this bad attitude? I'm afraid I won't. Then what is the problem? Are you unhappy? - Do you envy your brother? - Me? Envious? Ah, you don't know me very well. You'll wake everyone! Come on, tell me what's wrong. You're worried. Thinking about your future? Well yes, a little bit, anyhow. What about me? Think it isn't on my mind? Dimwit. I know. I spoke to your father. He was very upset, the poor man. I explained you couldn't accept help from Jean. Out of pride. So here... He'll sell his city land and you can set up a practice. - Happy now? - You're the best, mom! Ah, you'll suffocate me! But listen! Try to be nicer to everyone. I'll be a Prince Charming! I'm not asking that much. - Do you have a place in mind? - Yes, I saw a house with Louise. She likes it very much. What a view! Don't you think this home was made for happiness? Yes, surely. This will be my room. How will you decorate? Modern? I see it more antique, Louis XVI. On the mantel, a pendulum clock. Oh no! - A marble bust, a Houdon. - Very well then! Don't get angry. - I'm fine with the Houdon. - For the floor... - A pretty period carpet. - Alright. Settled, then. Want to help elsewhere? Which other rooms do you want to decorate? I don't know... Guest room? Kids' room? - Already? - One should plan ahead. - Anyone there? - Some business already! Yes, we're coming! What is it? Pardon me, I came to take away the agency sign. You're hurrying me? How do you know I'll rent it? The boss just gave Gustave hell for giving you the keys to visit. This place was rented last night. What? - It's already rented? - Yes. - So if I could have the keys. - Don't get discouraged. You'll find something else, maybe nicer. It won't be the same. - Here are your keys. - Thanks. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I suppose we should go. You'll never see how that Houdon marble would've looked. Ah, there you are. I was looking for you to try out my new car. - It's a nice house isn't it?. - Unfortunately, it's rented. I know. I signed for it last night! - You did? - Yes!. I didn't say anything, I wasn't sure to get it. Now it's inked, so if you want apples, no need to steal! C'mon, get in the car. Louise here, Pierre in the rumble. No thanks, I don't want to eat dust, and I have work to do. Suit yourself. Missed it, papa. It's a fun setup you bought me, but this rifle is defective. With my skills, I should never miss. - Ready? - Ready. Careful, someone's passing by. Who's that strange person? Oh, it's Loulou Vertu. A Paris chick Grandon set up on Rue Neuf for the summer. She wouldn't dare call here? Alice, go inside. I don't want you sullied by that creature. - But dear... - Inside, I said. - You too. - But I've met her often. Not in my house. Go inside. Here. - Mr. Roland, I believe. - Yes miss, may I help you? Master Bonnardel sent me. He says you have land for sale, and as I'm looking... Might we do business? But I have no land to sell. Master Bonnardel's clerk showed me the plot himself. He was mistaken. You're stonewalling me, but you'll sell it to me. - To you? That won't happen. - Ah, well keep it then! You old stuffed shirt! Who do you think you are? Someone respectable, and your money would be dirty. What? Not good enough? You must lose sleep over yours! What are you implying? Get out! You hear me? Out of here, worthless trash! Dirty brute! My friend will smash your face. You old pimp! - Who are you shouting at? - That bum called me trash. And that inheritance? The entire town is laughing at him. A cuckold should shut up and not look down on anyone else! Naturally, Pierre chats with her in the street. Another challenge to my authority. He knows you'll permit anything! But I'm getting fed up. Calm down, you'll make yourself sick again. I'll speak to Pierre. Tell him I won't sell my land. I wanted to please him, and this is where it leads? It's over! Let him work it out! Pierre, what is it? It's not worth getting upset. What's with everyone today? Pierre. Didn't we once have, in the house in Paris, a photo of Marchat? I think so. - What happened to it? - I'm not sure. You needed it? Why? For nothing. To look at it. And...for Jean. He should have a reminder of his benefactor, no? You're right, Pierre. I'll look for it. I've no idea where I put it. There's no rush. - Later then. - See you later, son. Good morning, Jean. - Good morning, Pierre. - Father. Good morning. - Good morning. - Morning. - Sleep well? - Yes. And you? Very well, thank you. - You look tired. - I'm quite fine. Haha, they make me laugh. A whole column about the idle rich. Read this, Jean. Still, it must be enjoyable to live without having to work. Say mom, were you able to find the photo? Which photo? You know, the one of Marchat. I don't even know where it is. Sure you do! You were looking at it the other day when I was shaving. You put it in your writing desk, after burning some old papers. Yes, you're right. I'll look again. You should go get it, I'd like to see him again too. We should even hang it. Would that be alright, Jean? Of course, why not? You found it? Ah, I knew it! - It was up there. - May I? You've seen? Let me have it. The resemblance is striking. - It's rather uncanny. - Who would you say it looks like? - Young Marchat, of course. - Of course. Poor guy. What were we to him? He was a handsome man. - I'll bet he conquered hearts. - How old was he? - Around 35. Isn't that right Alice? - Yes. I sort of remember him with grey hair. What's troubling you? Nothing. I got some bad news this morning. I lost someone... Someone I loved very much. You don't know them. A love interest? A woman? Yes. - She's dead? - To me, yes. Alice! - Mom! - She's not well! She needs water, vinegar! Pierre, do something! Your mother is sick! - It's nothing, it'll pass. - If we help her, surely. - I think it's her heart. - No, don't worry. Well let us help since you're sick. There's no danger. Just a nervous fit. Nothing to fear. She may have many more. I'm living a nightmare, you hear? 27 years living with people I respected and loved. I had a father, mother, brother, a family. Suddenly, I have no one. What's left is a monster I no longer love, the son of another man, comfortably under the same roof, and that woman... It's a lovely family. - Pierre, she's still your mother. - I hate her. 23 years, you hear me? 23 years. She lied every day, not even slipping up once. Lying to everyone. Mark the extent of the hypocrisy! It's appalling. And I can't even confront her. Not even to scorn her. She's before me like a quivering, pitiful creature. At times I'd want hold her, and cradle her like a child. Then forgive and forget. I can't... I tried. I swore not to torture or hurt her. But when she's there, avoiding my looks, cowering and shamefaced, despite myself, words lash out. I'm can't hold them back. I suffer so much to be good. My poor old friend. It's stupid to fall to pieces. You were the only one I could talk to. What will you do? I don't know. Then go elsewhere. You told me there was a job in the colonies. No, never that. I'll never cede my place to Marchat's son, never! - And... - And? There's someone here you don't want to leave. You're right, stay. Marry, build a life, see to your own business. In 3 months, you'll see it all in a new light. You were right, the Houdon looks much better on the mantel. Like it was meant to be. Jean, come see how I organized your closet. On my way, dear. - Shall I spill the big news? - Yes. Be right back, my darling. - It's splendid. - Maybe not splendid, but neater. Table linen here, personal things, and there, house linen. You'll find everything? Don't worry, mom. Then again...No. Come. Sit over here. I have some news for you. News? Don't worry. You'll like this news. Now then... Linens, the house, they're no longer my domain. Someone will take over. I mean...Louise and I just got engaged. - No? - You're the first we've told. - Do we have your blessing? - Of course! I'm happy for you Jean, - Louise is perfect for a wife. - I'm so happy. Does Pierre have any idea? I don't think so. I'm marrying, it's none of his business. Yes, of course. Working hard? There, it's you. Hello Pierre. Hello. So, my brother hired you to help him move in? Well yes, as you can see. - Did you pick the Houdon for him? - Yes. Nice one, it shows you remember ornaments better than people. - What do you mean, Pierre? - Me? Nothing at all. Just acknowledging you're a practical girl. I could only imagine a house for you, Jean gives you one. That's great. - Why wait to marry him? - But I'm not waiting. I'm marrying him. What? What are you saying? I said I agreed to marry your brother. Ah, well isn't that perfect. Excuse me, sister-in-law, but that's quite funny. You with my brother? It's the whole ball of wax! Pierre, don't begrudge me. - Be more considerate. - More considerate? Why? You never promised me anything. Why would I begrudge you? If our flirting never meant anything serious to you, I'm the only one to blame. It was up to me to dazzle you. Instead, I loved you foolishly. Not even daring to say directly. So of course when a ladies' man showed up, you went right to him. To cap it all off, it's Jean. Ah no. It's a funny twist. I'll forgive these words because you're dismayed, Pierre. But if I love your brother, it's not my fault, it's yours. - Mine? - Exactly. It's no secret, I've even told Jean I preferred you at first. Then, when I saw you as you really are, troubled, gloomy, envious... - You frightened me. - Of course. I knew I could never be happy with you. That my life would be a hell. Jean, brought calm and strength, tenderness, peacefulness. This is why I chose him. These tales don't fly with me. They just don't jell. - How's that? - Why lie? When our fortunes were equal, I was the better man. But the day he was a millionaire, you saw him with new eyes, as you did me. Oh, I can't blame you. Just please spare me your fine words, sentimental declarations with lovelorn glances. You've done well by marrying, just as most women do. - My congratulations. - Pierre, I pity you. I also pity you. To have to marry Jean, that will prove to live with. Leave Jean alone, you hear me? Nice indignation! Well acted! Save this tone for later, during your daily quarrels, once you've made him a cuckold. Vile man! What is it? I'm leaving and won't return until I'm respected in your house! What's with her? Louise! Leave it, she'll come back. - What did you say to her? - Nothing at all. I told that nitwit the truth about some things. Don't talk about her that way! I forbid it! Think it's your place to forbid me? Precisely! And I'm sick of your contempt! You won't dishonor those I love. You envy me, I've known for a long time. Since we were children, even. Envious? What on earth for? Your envy will kill you! Look at yourself! It oozes from you! You're angry because you think you're better than everyone. - You're a poor failure! - Shut up! You play victim, but you're a monster! You hate dad, you torment mom, You poison everything you touch! You lowlife! Dirty tramp! You're just a bum! I'll put you out of this house! - What? - In the streets! - Say it again! - You heard me! - With your money, in the gutter! - I'll put you out first! Get out of here! Pierre! Mom. Ah, poor mom. Come now, don't cry. Come now, I'm right here. Oh, mom. My god, not this. Not this. I don't want to see you crying. Dry your eyes. Blow your nose. What drama for my engagement day! Pierre really nailed the timing. You mustn't blame him. He's so unhappy. Unhappy why? Because of Louise? Of me? I think so. Listen, mom, Pierre may be in pain, but there's no living with him anymore. I know Louise and she'll never forgive whatever he said. I won't try to hide I'd prefer never to see him. Even you can't live with him. We need to end this. - I'll talk to him if you want. - Ah no. - Without anger, I promise. - No, I don't want that. This scene I just saw must never happen again! I'll talk to him. Sit down. Sit down, I must speak with you. If you get angry, I'm sorry, but I must speak my mind. What is with you? What do you want to know? If you feel entitled to explanations, speak plainly, like a man, instead of imputations, - and childish tantrums. - But mom... - Ah no, please. It's too late now. Speak. It's true. I do have a question. You want to know if Jean is your father's son. Is that right? Yes. Jean is the son of Marchat. He doesn't suspect, and I hope he never finds out. I know how this troubles you, but it was time to clear it up. My poor Pierre. I saw and understood it all. Followed your story, step by step. Your first inklings, your anguish, your disgust... I could do nothing to help you. Only suffer doubly and keep quiet. You've been loathsome, you know. We've hurt each other deeply. And we're still doing so. Now there's something else you need to know. This might surprise you, Pierre but I feel no regrets or shame. My true husband, my only love, was never your father. It was Marchat. I loved him the day I first saw him. I still love him. If I'd never met him, my life would mean nothing. No tender moment, not one memory to make me wistful when getting older. He wanted me divorced to marry him, but I declined. Because of you. So he left. I thought I was saved, but 2 years later, war brought him back. He begged me to see him. He was heading into danger, I faltered, you know the rest. If I've made a mistake, I've paid more than the price. In years that followed, I had to fake my life, lying, smiling, speaking, while secretly I was miserable. Without Jean and you, I'd never have lasted to this point. I'd have killed myself. You understand? You loved me too much. You would've ended up believing I was a saint. My poor child. There are few saints in this world. I'm a woman like any other. I knew I'd lose you by telling the truth. That's why I trembled as you discovered the facts. Unafraid for myself, you know. I was afraid for you. Well, afraid for us. Now, that's all over. You may be right, mother. I understand you, I'm sorry for you... But I can no longer live here. With the others, this lie we share, it would be unbearable. It's better if I leave. They've offered me a post in the colonies. I'll accept it. My poor son. Coming back to the house? No, my in-laws are over for dinner. - Tomorrow if you like... - Alright. - Goodbye, Jean. - See you tomorrow, mom. - Pierre gone, Jean married... It's just the two of us. Alone one-on-one, until we die. Subs: eunoia KG - DWC - SC In memory of Frank "Grimey" Grimes
