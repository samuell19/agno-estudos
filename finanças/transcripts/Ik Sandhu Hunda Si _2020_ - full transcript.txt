'Chandigarh.' 'Punjab's capital.' 'All the boys staying in small towns and villages of Punjab dream about..' '..completing high school so that go to Chandigarh to get a degree..' '..rent a room there and have the time of their lives.' 'These boys have come to Chandigarh with the same dreams.' 'Dimpy Brar and Sharan Dhalilival.' 'There are about to face the worst high water of their lives.' 'That is, a high tide.' 'Now God alones knows how that high tide is going to affect their lives.' Mr. Sharma had called me. He said that you boys are from decent families. - Okay. - I agreed because you would pay the rent on time. The refrigerator. Have cold water, make ice, do whatever you want. Do you see this wall unit, son? I got is especially made. It contains imported crockery. You can eat, drink and relax at the dinning table. These are the beds. You can use them. These are blankets, you can use.. They are a little dirty. Get them cleaned. Not a problem. - We will have them cleaned. - Come here, boys. This is a settee. You can rest here when you get tired. I had brought it from Delhi. Look over there, a poster of Kareena Kapoor. Keep looking at it and enjoy yourself. There's the cupboard. You can use it. Keep your clothes in it. Auntie, these bottles? - Mr. Sharma has a drink or two sometimes. - Okay. He must be hiding them in here. What are you waiting for, stupid? Throw them out! Oh, I see. Uncle plays hockey as well. No, the boys who used to stay here were hockey players. - Okay. - He was the university topper. - One of them is still the president. - Okay. I said throw them out! What if Sandhu-bhai (brother) comes back? Oh yes. No problem. You guys adjust a little. - No problem. We will manage. - Okay? - You help them clean up. - Okay. Make yourself useful. I'll go and have tea. Brother, Sandhu didn't play, he was used to slay. Payment in advance, sir. You guys leave. And I am left behind with a few shirts. I end up wearing them. You can have the money. What's the bungalow number? 22. Sandhu-bhai's? - Yes. - Right. No need. You can pay later. No problem. You can pay later. I am not worried about the money. So, to conclude, from school to college and from college to the university.. ..everything has changed. Except for this tea, bread and chutney. They still taste the same. I totally agree. Today, we attend all lectures. From tomorrow, we go looking for a girlfriend. The sooner we start the better. - Stand up. - What happened? President's right hand. President's men are here. The canteen's empty as well. Hello, brother. Stay away from them. - He looks dangerous. - He is very dangerous. Uncle, send tea and stuffed bread. So, new admission? Yes. - Come here. - Okay. Stand in a line. Come on. Very good. What's your hostel number? Not a hostel, brother. We have rented a room outside. - Sector? - 34. Bungalow number 22. Which? Number 22? You are staying in Sandhu-bhai's bungalow? Yes. You don't know where you are staying. That is a very lucky place. We used to wait for Sandhu-bhai to invite us to party there. Kang. If you need anything, any time, contact me. You'll be given top priority. You see the attention I get? It's all thanks to Sandhu. See you, take care. Uncle, let them eat on credit. Welcome to Chandigarh, my friend. Sharan, this has helped us extremely. We don't even need to bother to find out who this Sandhu is or is not. - We got lucky. - Very lucky. But like auntie said, he must be a topper. That's why everyone respects him so much. Come on then, cheers to Sandhu. Long live Sandhu-bhai! What are you celebrating? Where's Sandhu? Sandhu who? You uncle, dumbos. S-A-N.. D-O.. Sandhu. Now tell me, in English. I swear, I don't know. You? My dear big bro, I come today, new tenant. No clue, I swear. Stupid, I'll shoot from front and the bullet will come out from? - Salman Khan has told that to everyone. - Yes, brother. Sandhu is my enemy. A look at your faces makes it clear that forget belonging to his group.. ..you don't even belong to his village. We aren't. Come here. Me? Come on. Memorise this number, both of you. If you ever get any information about Sandhu, call me. Otherwise, Sonu Dhakka will give such a push.. ..that life will be no pushover. Let's go. Come on. 'Didn't I mention a high tide?' You want to study! In Chandigarh! This is what we had feared. I had met aunt just as I left the house. Mom had asked me to dust my shoes before going ahead. That was a bad omen. But I didn't listen to her. Forget it. Let's get out of here. Come on, let's go. Open the door. Who is that? Go and find out. - You answer the door. - Is anyone home? Let's go together. Let's go. Open it. Is anyone there? Come on. - Yes? - Here's your parcel, brother. Here. What are you staring at? Sign here quickly. I need go to other places as well. Hurry up. Number. Phone number. Hurry up. Okay. They have delayed me. Strange. Even the courier guys of Chandigarh have attitude. Huh? - This is for Sandhu. - Set it on fire. Well done. "Set it on fire." I have signed my name on it. Dimpy Singh Brar, son of Boota Singh Brar. After what I have heard of Sandhu, he'll set my family on fire. "Set it on fire." This is a wedding invite. Simran weds Monty. There's a letter in it. A letter? Read it. Rajveer, I don't know whether this letter will ever reach you. But this letter is my last hope. After you left I realised that you were right and my brother was wrong. He used us to expand his business and get Monty's wealth. Simran. Aunt! We are in trouble. What is this? Tell me, what should we do? You tell me. Sandhu? Or Dhakka? Yes? We were at the university. What's this commotion about? - I don't know. - Why are the cops here? - Tell me your name. - They are here for an enquiry. They do this every time. Stop, stop, stop. What happened, bro? Nothing. Sonu Dhakka thrashed Kang. Where can we find him? Kang's going to stay in the hospital for a few days. - Let's go. - Okay. Thank God he didn't beat us up. - Hurry up. - Tell me what had happened. Come on, let's go. Think about it, again. I suggest we should call Dhakka. Hold on.. I already have a lot on my mind. Hello, brother. Come. You have come to find out how I am doing? No, brother. There's a wedding invite. Brother, I apologise, I won't be able to attend it. I'll send a few boys over. - No, brother. - There was a letter in it as well. Who gets a letter to someone who is unwell? You should get fruits. Read it, brother. Here. Yes. So, things have gone that bad? Then this letter needs to be delivered. What's the date today, uncle? There is just one day left. How did you come here? - On our motorbike. - Can you drive a jeep? Yes, brother. Then help me up. Hats off to your friendship, brother. You agreed to come along in this state? I can even die for Sandhu-bhai. This is nothing. Kang-bhai, can I ask something? - Don't get upset. - Okay. We started staying in that room just two days back.. ..and all everyone is talking about is Sandhu. Some love him, some fear him and some are angry with him. Who is this Sandhu? What's the story? Like you need to mention the shores before you mention a river.. ..the same stands true for Sandhu as well. Sandhu wasn't alone. There were two more boys with him. Sharp eyes, sharper mind and a desire to become a leader. Garewal. And the other one was Gill. The one who used to cause trouble and take the backseat. Yesterday's dance show was fun. Boota enjoyed himself. - Garewal? - Yes? Are these boys from our college? How does it concern you? So, what will you have? - Order something spicy. - Order anything. Does it even work or have you kept it to scare the birds away? It can even scare parrots like you away. Do you want something? Really? - Yes, I want something. - What? 5 kilos flour. Do you have it? Come on, let's weigh the flour for him. Damn you. There starts another fight. There is a jeep racing at 100 km/hr on an empty road. The driver is furious. So that's Sandhu-bhai! That's me. Tell us where Sandhu is. I'm going to get him. Sandhu. His life stood on three pillars. His parents. His friends. And his blanket. Sandhu-bhai, Gill is getting thrashed. Let's hurry up. You..! Get up. Come on, get up. Is that enough flour or do you want some more? Hey! Damn you. Hey! There are just two things that are revered in the university. Books.. ..and Sandhu. I am fed up of the three of you. How many times do I need to tell you that... ...you need to behave yourself if you want to study in this university. But you guys just don't understand anything. You pick up a fight every day. Do you think you guys are some hot-tempered action heroes? Yes, Bhola? I'm in just a stupid meeting. I'll talk to you later. Garewal, don't make me rusticate all of you because of this. Okay, sir. One more thing. Elections are just around the corner. I don't want all this in the university. Do you understand? Yes, sir. - Get out. - Thank you. Garewal, this is what's called friendship. You saw how he made him fly like a gas balloon You were standing right to me and you didn't even touch them. This isn't the first time for you. You pick up a fight every other day. Just because you know Sandhu will handle it. And Sandhu has no brains. Thank God, he at least has a heart. We will get into big trouble if you continue like this. Why don't you just say that you are scared? I am not scared. When I will take a stand, I will be rock solid like a mountain. No one will be able to move me. Then I too will face death for you. I won't wait for Sandhu. Chunja ratted us out. Sandhu, I know where he hangs out. Wash it. Why? Raman is going around with Romi. She enjoys snacks with lucky. I feel like telling Romi and making him fight with Lucky. And then tell Gagan that Raman loves him. Brother, I didn't say anything to the dean. We didn't ask you that. Hey! Don't you have any manners? Crazy guy. Who does such things in the university? You came and slapped this poor fellow. Are you mad? What are you staring at? They come to the university wearing knickers. Don't you have any shame? Just because you have a lot of strength it doesn't mean that you'll kill him. Look at his face. Hey! Did you understand anything? Come on, get going now. And that was Sandhu's Simran. One look at her and Sandhu's heart started racing. We had to take him to a doctor. Do you understand the story now, doctor? I have seen such a case for the first time in my 15 years career. Something is wrong but nothing seems wrong. What is wrong? We too are surprised, doctor. A person who wouldn't let anyone speak... - ...has stopped speaking after getting scolded by a girl. - Oh, I see. He bawls out at others. And a girl bawled out at him. Oh, I see. So it was a girl. You should have said so. Then I am sure he can feel the breeze move. And her hair flying with the wind. Everything stands still. And you can see only her. - Mad! You are! - Am I right? Hey! Yes. So simple. I too was wondering what disease have we not ruled out here. Now whenever that girl comes close to him and his heart starts racing... ...put this pill under his tongue, okay? - Give me that. - Please pay the fees before you leave. Simran, you scold Sandhu like there's no tomorrow. I didn't like it. He's a very nice guy. I know him since my first year here. He never even looks at a girl. You say he doesn't even look at a girl? He kept staring at me. Like a crazy man. Then Sandhu is done for. Seriously, he is a very nice boy. And the one you scolded him for, deserves to be thrashed. Chunj, bloody taleteller. He keeps snitching all day. If I had been in Sandhu's place then I would have turned him black and blue. Really? Then what I did was wrong. I shouldn't have said those things to Sandhu. Sorry, Dolly. Don't apologise to me, go and apologise to Sandhu. 'They come to the university wearing knickers.' 'Don't you have any shame?' 'Just because you have a lot of strength it doesn't mean that you'll kill him.' 'Look at his face.' Hey Sandhu! Look, my hair is flying with the wind. Where have you been until now? Sandhu! Sandhu! What is wrong with you? Open your mouth wide! Wider! Wider! Yes! Get up, you lazybones. Are you alright? Did you have a reaction from the pill? Why? You woke up early in the morning. And you didn't ask me to make tea. I have made tea for both of you. And boiled eggs for you as well. Quickly get up and go to college. We came here to study and not sleep. Do you understand? Wait. Take the pills along. You never know when that girl might cross your path. Get up quickly! What is wrong with him? My dearest brother, Chunj Kumar. Stop snitching around. You might end up making someone angry some day. And when a person gets angry, he... I am not hitting you. I am just explaining. Listen to me. Hello. Sorry, I was too harsh with you yesterday. I didn't know that this boy is a taleteller. But you too should keep this in mind. It is not necessary that every issue is resolved with slaps. It can be resolved with love as well. Yes. I was explaining to him with love. Now don't embarrass me by being so respectful. I heard that you take very good care of the students. Then take care of me as well. Take me out for coffee. What? Coffee? Again? You won't need this anymore. Dolly told me that you don't even look at girls. - Yes. - Why? You don't like girls? I like, but not all of them. Then how many? Not many. Just you. Actually, I am a very simple guy. Romance isn't my cup of tea. I swear, I had to go to a doctor to find out that I am in love. My family were about to come down from the village to enquire about my health. Sandhu? Yes? You are great. - Yes? - Yes. Did you by chance switch on some fan inside you? Your hair has starting flying with the wind. Hair starts flying when you fall in love. "Even the best fragrance in my city," "Is shy of you." "You will bring back the dead," "If you pass by graves." "How do I express my feelings?" "I am in awe of Galib." "How do I express my feelings?" "I am in awe of Galib." "I want a poetry written for you, by Galib." "I want a poetry written for you, by Galib." "How do I express my feelings?" "I am in awe..." "My love..." "Everyone will talk about your beauty," "Beautiful you are from head to toe." "Let me tell you what's so special about you." "Everyone will talk about your beauty," "Beautiful you are from head to toe." "Let me tell you what's so special about you." "While I tell you all this," "I feel shy of Galib." "I want a poetry written for you, by Galib." "How do I express my feelings?" "I am in awe..." "The blind started seeing," "They started searching for you." "Seeing you laugh," "Even the mute in my city started talking." "For now, he only draws lines on blank pages." "Your beloved isn't a poet." "For now, he only draws lines on blank pages." "Your beloved isn't a poet." "That's why I try to convey what's in my heart, through Galib." "I want a poetry written for you, by Galib." "I want a poetry written for you, by Galib." "How do I express my feelings?" "I am in awe..." "My love..." Boys are right. Baggha is acting arrogant. He won't talk to anyone properly. We are tolerating him because you all made him the president. Right. Nowadays he shakes hand too like it takes an effort. Like this. Sandhu, even the boys from the game department complained. They aren't getting proper food. He gets a share at the cycle stand and the mess. He makes money from them. And he follows Monty's orders these days. Are you alright, brother? Everything is fine, Baggha. But you don't look fine. Why? What happened? Who is standing against you during the elections, this time? It's just me, I have everyone's consent. Even Monty is supporting us. Sit. Not here. During the elections. Why? When your shoes start hurting, it's time to dust them. Do you understand? Then who will contest instead? So I go ahead with the slogan? Go ahead. Garewal! Long live our leader! Garewal! Long live our leader! Garewal! Long live our leader! - Garewal! - Long live our leader! Long live our leader! Long live our leader! Long live our leader! - Garewal! - Long live our leader! Garewal! Long live our leader! - Garewal! - Long live our leader! - Long live our leader! - Long live our leader! Mr. Kaala, please don't mind it.. ..but I don't understand one thing. Until some time back you used to support me. But now. There's nothing to understand, Mr. Bansal. I supported you because you were doing well. Now I am supporting him, because he is doing well. Kaala behaves well with those who are doing well. Baggha, are you a Garewal? No, brother. Yesterday they were shouting slogans of Garewal instead of the current president. Brother, Sandhu has made a candidate stand against me. He was my supporter last time. So that means you don't have everyone's consent this time. So we will have to play politics this time. Right, brother. With Jagga-bhai's blessing and your support, I am already a winner. Not you, Monty. "I am waiting on the path on purpose." "Dhullah..." What was that other guy's name? Sandhu. "Sandhu, come and help me lift the basket." "I don't follow anyone's path." "Paths are formed where I tread." "We know how to pushover." "Government are formed with our support." "We scan the ground with our eyes." "We are proud of every vote we get." "I like to end matters amicably." "That's why I don't like to get into fights." "Don't..." "Don't have any doubts, my dear." "You don't stand a chance." "Don't have any doubts, my dear." "You don't stand a chance." "We debate on issues troubling us." "We always speak for everyone's benefit." "Once we give you our word." "There is no way we will back out from it." "If someone still tries to mess with us." "Then he disappears from the world map." "Don't..." "Don't have any doubts, my dear." "You don't stand a chance." "Don't have any doubts, my dear." "You don't stand a chance." started spreading their wings, brother. Pigeons in the university have It's time to clip their wings. Last one. Very good. Well done. Give me a high-five. Surinder! Take my handsome son away. He is done with dinner. Let him play the game. Bye, papa. - Let's go. - Bye. do I need to tell you... Kaala, how many times ...not to say such things before kids? It has a bad effect on them. Do you understand? There's a fire blazing inside me. but the heat doesn't go away. I eat cold things, Tell me. issues with the president's post. Brother, we are facing Issues... Elections are going to take place. Well, it's plain and simple. hearts of the students will win. Only the one who rules the So, you will have to be courageous. the college president on my own. Back in the days I became to become the president. And now I want Monty I support him. Not upfront. But with full back support. Fix a meeting. and others tease me. Simran, you know Gill They say Simran has made me speechless. Everyone calls you Sandhu? No, my family calls me Rajveer. Then I too will call you Rajveer. You are Sandhu for outsiders. You are Rajveer for your family. Oh, I see. So you are family? Do you have doubts? Yes, of course. But I am a villager. I have no doubts. From a Jatt family. for 30 workers to the field every day. We are farmers. We send food You are a girl from the city. Rajveer, you know I love villages. I don't like this fast-paced city life. I'll get your lunch. You work in the fields, Such a peaceful life. You should talk to your parents. I don't need to. if she agrees otherwise kidnap her. My father would say it's okay come and meet my family. No, I want you to I will, but at the right time. Of course, Give it here. Pass it to me. What are you doing? Basket it. Give it to me. Come on, throw it to me. - Over here. - Come on, man. to make Monty the president. We want you all to consent president wants as well. This is what the current You all too should accept it. then Kaala is here for you. If anyone needs anything That is okay. But brother needs to consent as well. Which brother? Are we expecting anyone else as well? If there is then call them as well. how much ever you want and sit out. Garewal, take whatever, more sense than money. You and Baggha need There is no GST on that. And forget that I am going to sit out. Listen, I know how to make people sit. We sit and get up as we will. There is no one who can make us sit.. ..or get up unwillingly. Sandhu, I think... A bad society gives rise to thieves. And universities give rise to goons. So vote peacefully. to prepare so well... I want both the candidates defeat is assured. ...that the opposition So don't fight and prepare yourself. We are well prepared in whatever we do. A word, boy? What is wrong? Monty is not good to be a president? doesn't make a coward brave. Putting up a brave facade Anger is a dangerous weapon. Stay clear of it as much as you can. looks like just another pond. A sea without a storm weren't in the university when I was. You should thank your stars, you that Sandhu wasn't there back then. You should thank your stars - Excuse me. - The thing is... Yes, Bhola? I am just attending a stupid meeting. No. I'll talk to you later. So, what were you saying? Nothing. Catch. Bhola and why don't we know him? First tell me who is this There is no Bhola. he is not as great as he thinks he is. It is just a way to show somehow that - Hi! - Hi! - Hello. - Hello, Simran.

Let me tell everyone. - Yes, brother? - Hello. Can everybody hear me? and she is my future wife, Mrs. Sandhu. I, Rajveer Sandhu, Does anyone have any objections?

How many times have I told you not to. that are revered in the university. There are just two things Books... and Sandhu. the one to object, not us. Her brothers will be her brothers will object.

Now the elections are more to you than your friend? Now the girl is more important made me contest in election. You are the one who - It is not wrong. - Did I do the wrong thing? We cannot back out now. But stick to your stand. Now you choose, the girl or your friend. comes the girl. I want both. My friend comes first then Why don't you understand, Sandhu? to mess with her brothers. We aren't capable enough They are different kind of people. I too am different, Garewal. Perhaps you don't know. run with their tails between their legs. The day I start fight, everyone will Hear me out. I am leaving. No arguments in friendship. Did I say something wrong? Saw that? You met him at the university. Garewal, you don't know him. I have been with him since childhood. you bend as the wind blows. You are like a willow tree, He isn't. He usually doesn't bend. then no one can make him erect. If he does, I am not stopping him. This isn't the right time. I know he does a lot for me. Fine. You sit here. I'll go and get him. on your way back. Listen, get more alcohol Fine, I'll get it. Where's your friend? I have two friends. Which one do you want? Sandhu. What do you want to do with Sandhu?

Don't joke with Kaala, brother. Someone tried to, once. I moved back a little. Got myself into the position... Took the pose... And boom! His black blood started pouring out. Everyone says that blood is black. I say... I am Kaala. Pearl millet flour or cornmeal? Now tell me, which flour do you want? Hey! Looks like you are out of cash, buddy. Tell that smartypants.. ..to leave this city before dawn. I'll make him leave the world. Otherwise, After our parents passed away.. ..I was the one who raised you and Kaala. anyone even looking at you. That's why I cannot tolerate I don't know what's going on in his mind. And that boy, He is going against Monty in the election. And he is getting closer to you as well. That's normal. that's something I.. But him ganging up on Kaala, Brother, Rajveer isn't like that. He is a very nice boy. Trust me. You are mistaken about him. Mistaken? He is always so hot-tempered. thrashing someone every day. He is beating up or Kaala barely managed to escape. Right, brother. I had gone to talk to him. We have raised her with love. To tell him, Simran is our sister. But he came after me with a sword. He would have killed me. Both of you are like my own child.

"But only the one Long live Monty-bhai! "There are only a few rare gems.." "Who can rule the world." Long live Monty-bhai! are missed after they are gone."

"Whenever I ask you for something, you say later." "Accept glass bangles for now, I'll get you gold ones later." "Accept glass bangles for now, I'll get you gold ones later." "Hey beautiful.." "I'll get you gold bangles later." "My love.." "I'll get you gold bangles later." "There is no rain without clouds." "A gem doesn't need jewellery." "There is no rain without clouds."

"Others are ready to lay down their lives." "Whenever I asked you for a new dress.." "You came up with a new excuse instead." "What's the use of you being a big shot.."

The problem is that Jagga-bhai said something bad in the hospital. You didn't tell me about it. You need to wait for the right time to say the right thing. What did your Jagga-bhai say? He asked me to talk some sense into Sandhu. Like Sandhu has been stealing his fodder. No, he doesn't steal his fodder. He meets his sister stealthily. Not stealthily, I meet her in front of everyone. And Gill endured the consequences of that. You are wrong here, Garewal. I would've stuck to my grounds even if they were after you. Has your Jagga-bhai.. ..promised to support you during the elections? Sandhu! Jagga-bhai is right. She is his sister. She loves me. I am not forcing his sister. She doesn't love you. Jagga-bhai told me that. The day you had thrashed Kaala.. ..Simran called me and told me the same thing. Why would I stop you, my friend? Tell me what you want. Jagga-bhai says that the matter will escalate if Sandhu.. ..enters the university again. And I too don't want.. ..you to enter the university till the elections take place. Jagga cannot stop Sandhu. But if you say.. ..forget the university I won't even enter Chandigarh. But I'll have to meet Simran once before that. - Did you like the dress? - Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. I want to talk to you. I don't want to talk to you. If you are upset because I thrashed Kaala.. ..then let me tell you that Kaala had first thrashed Gill. That too without any reason. You don't need to say anything. I know everything about you. What such do you know about me that you aren't even ready to talk to me? Let go of my hand, Sandhu. Let go of my hand, Sandhu. You have lost this right. Since when did you start addressing me as Sandhu? You need to think about that. Tell us what happened next, brother. What else could have happened next? Simran said no to Sandhu and Sandhu said no to the university. Gill obviously supported him. And Garewal become the president of the university. Stop! Stop! Stop! Hit the brakes. Stop right here. What happened, brother? Are you alright? My blabber will burst. There's a lot of pressure. Help me pee. I am done. Pull up the zip. Now I feel as light as a flower. Are you comfortable now? Yes. Stop or do you want to enter their kitchen? Brother, his father looks hot-tempered as well. You are right. He's more hot-tempered than Sandhu. Come on, now get me down. Who are they, Ramu? A few boys. - Help me get my feet down. - There you go. That looks like Kang. Who is with him. God bless you. - I seek your blessings. - God bless you. I seek your blessings, father. That's enough. It's okay. What have you done to yourself? It's nothing. I fell from the motorbike last night. I know the motorbike you fell from, son. - Father, Sandhu-bhai.. - Get water for them. - All ask them to make tea. - Okay. Father, Sandhu-bhai has gone out for work? He went to Canada. Huh? He's gone. How can he just leave for Canada. He just returned after attending Gill's wedding. Moreover, it takes four hours to reach Delhi. It's only been two hours. He must have not even reached Ambala yet. Like you have worked for the Indo-Canadian bus service. You know everything. Run for your lives, guys! - He'll thrash us if he gets hold of us. - Hurry up. - Don't you dare go after him! - Let's go. - Be careful. - He has barely taken up a job. Let him work. - Drive! Drive! Drive! - You scoundrels. - I am his father! - Get the car out of here. I am stronger then him. If you need him for a fight then take me along. For God's sake leave him alone. Right. They left. We barely escaped today, brother. I thought that he is hot-tempered. Yes, we barely escaped. I would've a rod on my foot as well if he had gotten hold of us. Forget that. Tell us what happened next. Simran was getting engaged, Sandhu got the lead.. Won't you ask me where we are going? Have I ever asked? Wherever we are going, we are going to cause trouble. Stop the car. Move back. No. This is what was left to be done? You coming here to create a scene. Leave! Just get out of here! "I would've used stick if I could fight with time." "I would've never fallen in love if I could read a heart." "I would've never fallen in love if I could read a heart." "I had never thought that my love would leave me." "That she would steal my heart then throw me out of her heart." "That she would steal my heart then throw me out of her heart." "For the ones who can make a man cry.." "There needs to be a punishment for such heartbreakers." "There needs to be a punishment for such heartbreakers." "I have heard that a person can go against the world for love." "Then how can someone you call your own treat you like a stranger." "Then how can someone you call your own treat you like a stranger." "For the ones who hurt and take your smiles away.." "There needs to be a punishment for such heartbreakers." "There needs to be a punishment for such heartbreakers." "There needs to be a punishment for such heartbreakers." "There needs to be a punishment for such heartbreakers." Get in. You too. Thank you. I had told you, but you just won't listen. What had you told me? That she doesn't love you. And she is someone's sister. Whatever they did with you.. Anyone else in their place would have done the same. And till when are we going to keep bailing each other out? Are you doing me a favour? He has lost his mind. What are you saying? We are leaving, Garewal.. Before we forget that we are friends. Sandhu.. Gill? There goes my past. Mine as well. "You cannot walk away from the ones you love." "There is no crime greater than breaking a heart." "There is no crime greater than breaking a heart." "For the ones who lead people to ruination.." "There needs to be a punishment for such heartbreakers." "There needs to be a punishment for such heartbreakers." "It is wrong to leave one between thorns after making them dream about gardens." "It is wrong to snatch away the dream you have shown." "It is wrong to snatch away the dream you have shown." "For the ones who do as they please.." "There needs to be a punishment for such heartbreakers." - Dimpy? - Yes, brother? Do you have a girlfriend? Girlfriend? No, brother. We had thought we'd come to Chandigarh and have a girlfriend. And here I have only made enemies. Sometimes there is betrayal and sometimes there is this. Right. Don't worry. Have patience. Everything will be fine. Stop! Stop! What happened? Do you need to pee again? - No. - Then? Pull over quickly. You demand a lot of service, brother. Stop. Stop right here. What happened? We need to check this restaurant as well. Sandhu used to get drunk and demand to eat here. So far away? We used to say the same. But he wouldn't budge. He used to come here. Let's go. - Let's check over here. - Come on, Sharan. - Come on. - Come on, help me get down. Hey, help me get down as well. They are leaving me behind, idiots. How will you recognise him? None of them looks like Sandhu, brother. Come what may, we need to find Sandhu today. And here I am. - What do you want from Sandhu? - You are mistaken, brother. Kang, help us out here. I will wait for you till the wedding takes place. Otherwise, I will accept whatever God wills. But you will always remain my soulmate. Your Simran. - Yes, son? - How are you, father? - Are you in the jeep or the plane? - Jeep. Father, did you sell the land already? If only I had gone there. Don't sell it. We'll do farming now. Those scoundrels didn't stop, they managed to find him. Bhaana, give the bag to mother. Tell her that I'll come over in the morning with her daughter-in-law. Okay, brother. I've spent my life with them.. ..and I am yet to understand this father-son duo. Yes, uncle. I am coming. You play the next song. Yes, I am coming. They are sloshed outside. They are dancing like crazy. He are so excited about my wedding. Actually, we are having a wedding in this family after a long time. My uncle is playing a handkerchief like a flute. I don't know which snake he intends to capture. That's why everyone is sloshed. Are you alright? Yes. May I lift the veil? You are so beautiful. I always wished that my wife to be more beautiful than Kareena Kapoor. My wish has been fulfilled. Someone's phone's ringing. It's yours. You have made me so happy. They say that after marriage a girl gives everything she has to her husband. You can answer your phone. No, it is your phone. Mine? Oh. It's Sandhu. My friend. Sandhu. He has gone to Canada. You are calling me from the plane as well? No. Then where are you? Outside your house. Come on out. It's my wedding night. We'll meet in the morning. We aren't taking you anywhere. We just want to talk to you. Then talk to me on phone. Don't make me slap you. You can leave after you hear us out. Damn.. He loves me a lot. I'll be back in just two minutes. Huh? I'll lift it again after I come back. Two minutes. Don't go to sleep. I'll be right back. It's not like getting angry would change things. Don't get angry and get to work. Find out where can we find Simran. Will you be able to spend your wedding with your wife if you stare at me? Simran's always with Dolly. Where is Dolly? No, brother. I owe her money. I cannot go before her. - Dolly, I... - Shut up! Not a word. You know I had to pay all that you owed to the kitty group. I'll pay you back. Sandhu might have the money. I'll pay you as soon as he comes back. I am in a bad shape and you still slapped me. You should at least see whether we have an audience. Stop being angry now. Love you. Shameless. I am sorry, Rajveer. I misunderstood you. - He'd broken our bones. - This was necessary. Gill, I am getting a call. Take it out of my pocket. Damn you! It's Dolly. Yes Dolly, my sweetheart? Jagga knows everything. Don't go through the bypass. Change your route. Okay, love you. I am not going to elope with you. I am going to marry you. Good that they are waiting on the way. Otherwise, we would have to go to your house. - What's say Gill? - Yes. But... Sandhu... - Hey. - No. Have you ever been thrashed? No brother, we have managed to escape so far. Same goes for Sandhu. But those who are with him always do get thrashed. He has dared to mess with Jagga. Get rid of him. Be careful but, that's my sister with him. What happened? Are you alright? Come on, we won't spare him today. There are no blankets for the meet and greet. So I'll greet your relatives with a hockey stick. You... That's Garewal. Didn't I say? When I will take a stand, I will be rock solid like a mountain. No one will be able to move me. The type of a person you are... ...you need someone like me as your son-in-law. And not like him. I want you to hand her over to me. Brother, I know that you love me more than you love yourself. And I love Rajveer just as much. I won't be able live without him. When he learnt that you are blocking the way... ...he could have easily changed the route. But he doesn't want to elope with me. He wants to marry me. You are quite hot-tempered, aren't you? Let me riddle you with six bullets and cool you down. Put it down. Gunpowder causes an increase of production of blood in my body. And when that happens, I tie up men to my jeep. If you still have doubts then go ahead. - Damn you... - Kaala. Shoot me! He is right. We need a son-in-law like him. - Come here. - Brother. May God bless you. Here you go. - Amazing! - You are great, Sandhu brother!
