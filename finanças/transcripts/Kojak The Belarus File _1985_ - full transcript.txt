You lost some illusions, the miracle is you still have any left. It started way back, after the war everyone wanted to forget. Tried to forget. Here we went on with our lives, grew, gained position, power, but for some, the horrors, the pain of that war 40 years ago, will never end. Let me to tell you what you would've seen and heard had you been with me on Thursday. It will not be pleasant listening. If you're at lunch, or if you have no appetite to hear what Germans have done, now is a good time to switch off the radio. Or I propose to tell you of Buchenwald, is on a small hill about 4 miles outside Weimar, and it was one of the largest concentration camps in Germany, and it was built to last. As I walked down to the end of the barracks, there was a moan from a man too weak to get out of bed. It sounded like the hum flapping of babies, they were so weak. We proceeded to the small courtyard... There were two rows of bodies, stacked up like wood, some of them shot to the head, but they bled very little. I tried to count them as best I could, and arrived at the conclusion of all what was mortal of more than 500 men and boys laid there, in two meat piles. Murder had been done at Buchenwald. If I've offended you by this rather mild account of Buchenwald, I'm not in a least sorry. I reported what I saw or heard, but only part of it. For most of it I have no words. THE BELARUS FILE I thought you're still asleep? What time is it? You haven't been in bed papa, what's the matter? Nothing, I.... Papa? - Elisa, I'm alright... I just fell asleep on my chair. - You probably caught cold. Nonsense. You go on. You don't want to be late. I'm like your breakfast. What would you like? I'll make my own. Are you sure? - Yes I'll make my own breakfast. - All right. You're not in good mood this morning. Papa. Uh... I'll be working late. Will you get your own dinner? Yes... you go on. I'll see you tonight. Mr Barak? We know you're in there. These are the people. Zavatsky... Kastenov... Fitzev? They found him in a back of the print shop. And nobody heard anything huh? So far. - There probably fifty people heard it, who looks? Well, does anybody know who he is? Vladimir Fitzof, Fitzaf... F-I-T-Z-E-F A ring, gold watch, $300 in cash and some change in his pocket. He could've had something, a bag or case. Don't know. - Yeah. You're not with the safe and law squad now Lustig. I didn't know that. - And when you don't know, you don't guess! You find out! Right? Now what's the story? It was a hit. No two ways about that. That's even better. Okay, so what do we got? Man with an enemy? Mrs Fitzev, I'm Lt. Kojak, New York Police Department, and I'm terribly sorry. Thank you. Do you know, if anyone might've threatened your husband? No, no. Did he ever talked to you about any enemies he might have? People he didn't like or people who didn't like him? Never, no. Everybody liked him. So you don't know anybody who might've done this to your husband? No, everybody loved my husband. Lucky man. A good man. Well again my condolences. Hi, I'm home. Papa? Yeah, hold on I'll see. Lieutenant, Elisa Barak on the phone. Well, what a nice surprise. Papa didn't come home last night, I'm really worried. Now take it easy. - What should I do? Where are you? - In his office. I don't know what to do. - Okay I'll be right there, okay? Here's you memo Pat Russell. Hey. That's alright. - Where is he? Where is he? I don't know. Tell me... has he ever done this before? Sometimes, he gets upset-minded, forgets to tell me he won't be home for dinner, but never stayed out all night. - Uh-huh. Did you try hospitals? - Yeah. When he wasn't in his room this morning, I didn't... I came here. - Come on, we're gonna find him. Come on now, talk to me. I don't know, he always just been really strange, I'm worried about him. Strange? How? Place says there's nothing bothering him, but I know there is. There are two reason why the man at your father's age would act strange, and the most important one is his business problems. What's the other one? - Well, if you pardon the expression... a woman. Papa? - Hey, don't count this off that quick yet. Hello? - To Lt. Kojak there. Just a minute. It's for you. Yeah? - Captain Gay wants to talk to you. Go ahead. This cutie pie mean anything to you? Nothing. Lieutenant? - Yeah? - We have that meeting. Alright, I'll meet you there. Bye. Why would he keep a picture of a nazi? - Do you mind? You have to go? Yeah. I want to call you at work. Sure. Or I'll call you. And I don't have to worry about you. Yeah I'm alright. You know there's expression I was a kid. So is your old man. Take care. I need to report right away. - OK no problem. Murder in a ballroom. He sure wasn't dancing. New ring? Yeah, I got a blooming... Nikolai Kastenov... Vladimir Fitzev, is that interesting or isn't it? They sure was both murdered. What else were they? Same age give or take. - What else? Male Caucasian. Caucasian? Yeah. Fitzev and Kastenov, two old Russians, interesting huh? You think they're connected? Look, about 5 or 6 weeks ago there was a murder in Jersey, remember? Jersey? When they get a slug out of Kastenov, I want to match it against Fitzev, okay? You clean up here, and I want all that details on that Jersey murder. What Jersey murder? Gorbaczev... Robaczev, it's not on the nose but it's close enough, okay? Gorbaczev... You got it. Theo! Well... the missing person Peter, nice to see you. I feel like an idiot. I worried Elissa, I'm sure she put you through all kinds of trouble. Is entire police force looking for me? No...there is a couple of guys on the job. Where've you been? It's ridiculous... I had to go to Boston, something came up suddenly. I left then note for Elissa but somehow she never found it. My guess is the cleaning lady suddenly decided to be efficient and threw it away. The cleaning lady? - Yeah. Come on. Let's go upstairs, I'll buy you a couple of drinks, we'll talk over old times and we'll forget it. I can't Theo, I'm on my way to the airport. You do get around. - I have to be in Atlanta at 9 a.m. I think I'm getting too old for this. Well, I've seen you look better. I know, I'm like a lone lucky maniac. Say, is my memory playing tricks with me ? Didn't we use to have time Theo, drink some wine, talk about life. You're all well, yes? Yeah, better now that I don't have to worry about you. Hey, it's forgotten. - Thank you. Will you get back? Absolutely, I'll call you. Have a nice trip. My apologies. Papa. Papa? Papa. Look at me. I'm perfectly alright. What's the matter? Why are you doing this? Shhh. One day I'll tell you all of them. - No. Where do you live now? - At home. Elissa, I told you... You didn't tell me anything. You said go stay with the friend. What I am supposed to say, am I afraid to live alone? Yes, say whatever you want. Papa, I can't hide, I have to go to work. I don't....understand? It's not safe here. Tell me who you're afraid of. I'm not gonna leave you, until you tell me how I can find you again. You remember when I showed you, how to leave a message on a computer bulletin board? The number you call is on my desk at the office, if you really need to reach me. Then, connect with the bulletin board and enter the message. "Papa I miss you" Then you have access to a computer? Well, never mind that. My passport and my cheque book? There're in there. This isn't really happening. No, I know this. It's a lot of foolishness, but I'm taking care of myself. I know that's you want me to do, that's what I want you... I will. Go away. - Papa. Go away. Elisa! How is it going? - Slowly. I didn't expect to find you here. - I was in the neighborhood. What kind of work you're doing here? I'm an architectural historian on keeping records of the inside of this church. Well your old man's gotta be pretty proud of you. I saw him last night. Where? On the way to the airport. Oh. Look, I'm really sorry for all trouble. That's alright. Feeling better now? Yeah. Thanks for everything. - I didn't do anything. You were there. When I promised you father, we get together soon. Okay. Oh... by the way, I knew there was something I want to ask you. My cleaning lady, she's a disaster. I was wondering if I can borrow yours for a couple of half-days a week until she sobers up? We don't have a cleaning lady. That's interesting. Look Theo, I don't want to be rude but I really have to get back to work. What did you say her name was? I owe you one. I got it. That's very interesting. Fitzev and Kastenov were shot with the same gun. And what did you got? That guy in Jersey, Dimitri Gorbatchev, age 72, they can't release the slug the case is still open, but if we want to bring ours over they'll see if they match. Kelly! Any suspects? Anything else? Alert the community, no known enemies. And he wasn't robbed? - Only his life. Got Immigration? It looks like they both came here from the old country. Alright, you get down there and pull the records, and.... add one more. - Dimitri Gorbatchev. The records on Fitzev and Kastenov was sent to Washington years ago. They don't have them here. Well you get Washington to send those records out there. I'll see what I can do. What the hell does that mean, Kelly? Well, they guy said you want the records, try the U.S. State department. - State department? Mr Kennert said to tell you he's sorry, this material is classified. Classified? - That's right. If you wish to see it, you have to have the proper clearance. Oh. No, wait a minute. Sir? I told him he couldn't go in. Lt. Theo Kojak, New Your city police department. I know. Miss Henkel. And sir, I've been done here all afternoon. Look, there's nothing I can do to help you. I've been polite, I've been patient, I've been dilligent, and you know something? I still know nothing. No, no you can't, no I can't, no you do, zippy do... Why don't we save both ourselves a lot of time and trouble? Do you understand about our classification system Mr Kojak? Mr... Kennert? I understand all about your um.... classification system. Now if you want clearance, you call the Commissioner! I'll call the Mayor! Look, I am terribly sorry but there's nothing I can do to help you. Sir...a citizen needs a little help. Can't you give it to him? Why do you want to see these records? Alright, I want to see if I can find something to tie these three guys together. And what makes you think something may? You mean besides all three being murdered? Wait outside a minute. Mr... Kennert, the only reason I'm here because I don't wanna wait outside! Then wait here. I'll be back. Thank you. ...like once favorable consideration from the IMF, well why...why don't you think it mattered and call me back? There is a New Your City policeman in my office. He wants to see some classified records, and at this point stonewalling will be a lot more trouble that just giving him a little access. Now don't go over... Chris. - What? For how long? - Why? Do you know who Agent Fisher is? They're on the agenda for the day after tomorrow. I'll take care of that. Look, I don't have time to stand here and argue, somebody's got to hold his hand. Well why me? - Dana. Okay. Maybe I can get a ticket fixed. I'll send him in. Oh and... it's important - keep me informed. Mr Kojak, Mrs Sutton will take care. I'm Theo Kojak. Dana Sutton. Please. How may I help you? Yeah, well I wanna know why Immigration records are classified. You don't understand the government, Mr Kojak? Well you can say that again Mrs... Sutton. Well the first thing they teach you is: when in doubt, classified. Fitzev, Kastenov, Gorbachev. Well I'll see if Washington has any information on these men, if so I'll have it sent up. I'll also look here, we have a lot of files downtown. How long will it take to get those Washington files? By courier tomorrow. What? I think I finally got lucky. I'll have Ginger Ale please. Whiskey on the rocks and a glass of water. You don't drink? Well... if I drink I want to have a cigarette. And if I have the cigarette, I despise myself. and if I despise myself, I go back to smoking. Now you don't want have that on your conscience. How long ago did you stop? That'll be 5 days Saturday but who's counting... You're foreigner right? I mean, you're not New York person? No...no, Virginia... and...college and law school in North Carolina. On your way too? Assistant secretary for European Affairs. Oh. - Not too shabby huh? Not too shabby huh? So you're in a public service. As opposed to the private sector. Well, that's what the money is, no? Except I don't need the money, and I'm where the power is. Dana? - Back here. Theo! I think I found something. - Yeah? They were all in the same concentration camp during World War 2. Oh? Just wanna check these fileboxes here if there are any other references here. When they came over here, were they together? - No. Does it say when they arrived? Watt a minute, I think I have them on my notes. Yeah, Gorbaczev came in 1948. - Oh. that early. And the third one came in 1951. And they were all in the same camp? - Koldichevo. Say that again? Koldichevo. You know these files are very old, they're handwritten, I really couldn't make it out, I think that's in Poland. German-occupied Russia. Does that mean something to you? Well there's a fella in a little trouble... and he...kinda disapppeared. Oh. - He's from Russia, and he was in a concentration camp. Koldichevo? What do you think about that? I don't know. What should I think? Where do we go from here? Let's gonna go back up down to my office. Can you take another hour? Kennert said I should take care of you. He said to take care of me? It's gonna take another hour. „At Dachau, near the city of Munich, in southern Germany, grim evidence of nazi atrocities. General Dwight Einsenhower and Gen. Omar Bradley inspect the concentration camp. The victorious generals see with their own eyes what allied armies saved the world from. A scene of horror, as the world continues to learn a crimes against humanity, inside Hitler's Germany. Okay, now we're getting into Russian staff. ...and in territory of the Soviet Union occupied by the German army... - Koldiczewo. other camps are discovered. Film footage, taken by Red Army cameraman. Officials and town's people from Koldiczewo arrive at a concentration camp, where nazi occupiers killed thousands for religious and political reasons. Bodies of victims are found piled in a warehouse, denied even the dignity of a burial. A gruesome legacy of the retreating German army. Captured nazi commandants look on as the shocking record of their crimes is exposed. These are the faces of German officers, who committed uncounted murders. - Hold it! Back it up! Hold it right there. Is it he or isn't he? That's the same man. Where'd get that picture? A commandant at a camp where three murder victims used to be prisoners. Where your friend was too, Barak. Who is he? What happened to him? Did he survive? Theo, how is Peter Barak tied into all of this? I don't know. His family got wiped out, right here he is often homeless. I remember he told me once: "The only thing you can think about was becoming an American citizen." You know something? He did. Anyway it's 1953, 1954 and he finds his way to New York. I'm a beat cop at the time, right? And he moves into the neighborhood, he was afraid of me and I'm "the law". Anyway we got to know each other, time goes by, he gets married, he has little girl, and whenever I need a home, he's there. He must know somebody's killing people from that camp. Do you have any idea who? I'd like to ask him. Exemplary, devotion to duty. Is it true what I hear? You think we have a serial killer? Possible. How possible? Come on captain, give me a break okay? Possible. I'll give you a chance. I'm not gonna say anything about it. Excuse me, Do you want something? - Yes. I'm Lt. Kojak from New Your Police Department, and this is Mrs Sutton from the State Department. If it's appropriate, I'd like like to ask you a few questions. What would you like to know? Are you a relative with Mr Kastenov? - No. Did Mr Kastenov know Vladimir Fitzev? - No. Or do you know Vladimir Fitzev? - No. How about... Dimitri Gorbaczew? - No. What, nobody ever heard of them? - Is that all? Who'd wanna kill Mr Kastenov? Nobody. - Go some place else. No more questions. Where to now? I wanna look around. What are we looking for? - Good question. Another new grave. Vadim Sevatsky... catch the date. Same age group. No, I'm just asking. Lieutenant? Yeah, well if it's fast come in, if not, get out. If you can find a death certificate of Vadim Sevatsky, I wanna know how you did it. I romanced, yelled at, begged and pleaded with every corner from here. A death certificate doesn't exist. Well, what'd you know... ...and I'm killing myself looking for death certificate. Who was here first? - Steve and Lane, around the corner. He was where, on a train? Yeah, he was a... - He was on a platform four. The report came in, he was shot? - That's right. Here and here. Oh? You know what he looked like? These came from a gunman. - Man, hey! You're a Greek? - No. You call me lieutenant. - Lieutenant. Alright. Anybody recovered the slugs? - I don't think so, not yet. Do you think he knew the guy? - Not from what I see, not the way it looked to me. Alright, who was he? - Donald O'Johnson. No driver's license, 1543 dollars. You counted it. - Where is his ID? This is it? That's all we have Lieutenant. - Brand new Lieutenant. Vadim Sevatsky... You wanted to be dead... you're dead. Confidential informants... to be opened by authorised personnel only. SDO 79196... not in here. Wait. Not in here. - Oh? SDO 79196, I will track it down. Someone must've pulled it. Hello. Have you seen that before? No. - Well I have. Once on the photograph at the cementery. What the hell is it doing in State Department's files? Come on, throw the ball. Sam, I'm here. You haven't come to see me for a such long time. It must be business. I understand you're very busy man. - Sam, enough already. Alright, alright so, let me here. This is Russian. - That's why I came to see you. I went to that Russian's church on avenue D. They don't know who it was, or maybe they don't want to ell me. So you came to see your old friend Sam? Right there. Where did you get this? It's from the other Russia. So used to called White Russia? Yes, it's the emblem of the Belarus Division. Do you know about the Belarus SS Division? - No. It was organised during the German occupation, German SS officers organised it. But the important thing is that it was made up by collaborators from the community - Russians. They did the Germans' dirty work for them, they were as bad...what....worse! Almost 2 million, a quarter of the population of Belarussia were killed by these.... nazis, these... collaborators. Okay, Sam. Look, I'm sorry. Next time I owe you a bowl of soup. Sorry this is a closed area. Mrs Barak? Yeah. Hello. My name is Müller. I'm a friend of your father. - Oh? Oh, well....how are you? I'll move to the point, Ms Barak. Ho is your father? - He's fine. Why? I had the difficulty locating him. I'm worried about him. Well he's away, he's out of town. - Oh? I'd be obliged if you tell me where I can reach him. You can't reach him. - I have to reach him, it's important. We have a critical business arrangement, your father and I. Except, I'm afraid there's no way to reach him. He's on a cruise, he needed to rest. The cruise? - Uh-huh. He didn't tell me that. - No? Oh well, there was a... you know, Pete just decided really fast. I'll speak to him on... on a telephone! What's his ship? It's not that kind of a cruise. He chartered a sailboat, there's no way to reach him. There must be a way to reach him Ms Barak. Sorry. - I have to talk to your father. You can't. - You don't understand, he's in danger. What? - Don't you hear me? He is in danger! I thought you said this was business. - He is in danger. What's the matter with you, don't... Oh my God. - You tell me where he is. I must see him. I...I'll kill you. Now you tell me where your father is. - I don't know! Tell me! - I don't know. I'll find him, you father. I'll find him. Let her go. Are you sure it's the man on the picture? Yes. Yes, I'm sure. Alright Elissa, take it easy. He was horrible Theo, he was just horrible. Okay kid, now you listen alright? I can help your father but first I got to find them right? Right. There's a computer in his office. I can send him a message. Oh good now we're talking. I'll meet you there and... look, be cool right? Be cool and be careful. I'll try. - Right. Nothing yet? Are you hanging at the office or you're going home? I still have a little more to do. Uh-huh. Ain't joy yet on that missing file? Not yet. You know, I gotta believe the answers are in there, that's why we can't see it? Well, they're sticking to their story that it's on its way. Call me if anything breaks. - Here he is. Hold on. Ask who it is. It's him. - Tell him you must see him. Tell him you must see him. Okay. We've made contact. - Great. Did Peter Barak say he'll meet you? - He'll show. When? - Tomorrow. You must be so relieved. How about I come by and pick you up? - Oh? Yeah we'll get a bite to eat. Give me half hour. - I'll be outside. Gallantry huh? - See you soon. Goodbye. Our detective? - Yes, he found Peter Barak. I mean the daughter made contact. - And? They're meeting tomorrow. I'm glad I stopped by. I want you to get out where he can see you. What time is it? - Almost 10 a.m. Okay, we'll be right here. Elissa? Elissa! - Papa? Find the path and walk down! Where is she going? - Wait here. Now, what's so important? Papa. Oh papa. Yes, it's papa. - Come home. Soon. Please now. - Not yet. Yes now please. Before I can... Before who can what? What you mean? Who Elissa? Is his name Buchardt? He said his name was Muller. Now he said he's Muller... his real name is Buchardt. I know he'd come, sooner or later. Theo wants to talk to you. Theo? She's trying to save your life Peter. Theo. Peter, we've been worried about you. - No need. I found the picture Peter. Who is he? He's one of yours. Mine? - Yes Theo. Why is he looking for you? I made a nuisance of myself Theo, to the wrong people. Who did you see? Come on, come it up here, we'll talk about it. Papa...stop running. Yes sure. The man in the picture Peter, he was a commandant right? Your concentration camp? Goodbye Theo. Papa! Papa! Help me! Stay here. Okay, hold it! Police! Drop it! Don't shoot, don't shoot! Do it, throw it down. We're Federal agents! I'm going for my ID. - You better come out smiling! Theo! Two for the price of one, and still no bargain. Dana Sutton, what is it? The third? Knows where the power is? And goes to like a bimbo to a sailor! Call security. - No it's alright. Is it what they taught you down at the old plantation? When they catch you, stick your chin out, and God bless tradition. What is it you think you're doing? Deception, double cross. You have some strange idea, as I understand Ms Sutton works for me. You want loyalty, you hire it. I did. You sure got your money's worth, didn't you? Now you listen. The only one who knew we flushed out Barak, besides Lustig, myself and his daughter, was you. And you, you sent out your guns out to kill him. I sent agents out to bring him in so we could ask him some questions. And I wonder how he've been brought in if we weren't there? In a body bag? Oh! You didn't know? I mean all that enthusiasm, hand in hand, "let's go look at the files". All you have to give a damn about was using me to get to Peter Barak. You know that's not true. What is it he knows? Is it in that file? That file that they don't want anybody to look at? Is that it? Now that I think about it, you must've been the one who pulled it. Look, if I were you, I'd get out of here right now. You know, you did everything you could to get in my way. Now there's Nazi war criminal killing old men, and now I'm gonna make it my business to see if he's doing under your protection. You're wrong. For all I know, you may be using the same nazi to get to Peter Barak. Do you need us Mr Kennert? Oh, the Marines. - Take him out and make sure he goes quietly. And... not a minute to soon. Naughty, naughty. Here, picu bu. And you, have yourself a brilliant future! What the hell is going on here? Who loves you baby? Four kindly old men, murder victims, used to be in a concentration camp. Nikolai Kastenov, the poor old house painter? Nikolai Kastenov... served with a Waffen SS, as a nazi police commander. During the German occupation of Belarussia, took part in the fighting against the Soviet Army, and Russian peasants. Vladimir Fitzev, oh, everybody loved him. Vladimir Fitzev directed the massacre of innocent inhabitants of the Borozov district, also edited the fascist newspaper „Rannitsa”. What are you talking about? The first contingent, about 20 men, were made to dig pits, jump into them and shot from above. Fitzev personally supervised the killing throughout the day. Lots were smashed by rifle butts and bodies were mutilated. Autopsies conducted after the war showed that some babies, to save ammunition, had been thrown into the pits and buried alive. Vadim Sevatsky, gunned down for no apparent reason on a New York subway, you remember? Vadim Sevatsky was selected by the German invading force to organise the counties around he city of Minsk. He headed the government and under his administration, 2/3 of approximately 375,000 Jews in the region, were slaughtered. Oh, they could've been in the concentration camp alright, except they weren't inmates, they ran the joint, along with our hero here, Obersturmbannführer... Heinrich Buchardt The records are all in here. The real ones and the phony ones. Barak too? No. No, he really was an inmate. Does uh, Gay know what you're up here? What does that mean? Well, he told me to pack up all Homicide files and, have then sent down to the Homicide squad. Don't do anything. Well, what would I do about old case? I'll have a word with him. Lieutenant. You've lost your nerve huh? I got a call about you. - Captain, you could've been a star. Lieutenant, you're wasting everybody's time. They're waiting for you down there. You've got to tell then everything you got. You know I understand they don't make a lot of room for you Julius. And who might to tell you that you're wrong for playing it safe? For what it's worth, I'm not the one who took you off this. Look, no matter what I fell about you, no matter what you fell about me, I think this is dirty boom. Captain, I appreciate. Let it go Theo. It's a case. It's a case. You know what it's really about, Frank? You've been throwing a way around in a wrong places. Like where? - The U.S. State department. Who'd they get to? The Commissioner? Theo, it belongs in a Task Force. It's nothing personal. Frank listen, okay? Southern Russia, World War 2. This is the part of Russia that's under German occupation right? Some of the Russians, they collaborate, they help the Germans. They point at the Jews. Got it? Okay, the war's over, these bums, these Russian collaborators they began to show of displaced person's camps, passing themselves off as real VPs. Now listen to this. Allied Intelligence, they know all about these collaborators. They know all the crimes, they know the whole story. And now we got somebody in Washington comes up with a bright idea: "Let's not punish these hyenas for what they did, let's use them. We'll use them as..gorillas against the Soviet Union, but first we gonna train them, we gotta sneak them into the United States." But that's against the law. I can't believe this. - They set the whole thing up. The Belarus Brigade, these Russian collaborators train themselves to do something against Russia, and some of them are actually sent. You mean a year, 2 years after the deathcamps? Frank, I got a friend. He was in one of these deathcamps right? 40 years go by, he's walking down the street... now I'm just guessing - and he spots one of them. Hey, what's he doing in this country? What's he doing still alive? So he follows them. And what does he find? More collaborators. They killed his father, mother, sister. What does he do? And I'm just guessing: He went to the proper authorities, and he told them. And you know what? They stonewalled him, the way they stonewalled me. Where is your friend right now, Theo? Oh I don't know. The question is: does my friend get the Buchardt before Buchardt gets to him? Jeez... no wonder they want you off this. Who is this Buchardt? Heinrich Buchardt, he was with the German occupation forces in Russia during the war. He's the one who started the Belarus Brigade, he's the one who started this whole group. You're saying a commandant of a concentration camp? I'm telling you about the real world Frank. And I'm telling you I don't believe it. And we think we know what's it all about, right? Some poor slabs sticking the needle in the arm to find little peace? Somebody holding up a candy store, sticking the knife into his neighbor? That's not what it's about Frank. It's about power. The people who possess it, and the evil they do with it. That's what it's about, Frank. Heinrich Buchardt, still on the US payroll. The only contact with these other Russian collaborators, and with the help of U.S. government, keeps the lid on this dirty mess. And you say it's just a case. I'm telling you, it's too big. For what? - For you. For us. I can't run interference anymore. We got away with it, we had a long run. You're doing it your way, me explaining to the bosses. But Theo, it's a different era. Now you're off the case. Frank, because they don't know, and you got to tell them. Tell them what? That Theo Kojak's on a tale? I'm not on a tale Frank, for 40 years they've been keeping this from American people. You've just been telling me the facts of life, alright. It is about power, and Theo, you don't have any. You're not gonna stop, are you? I can't help you. You've been here all night? Yeah, I thought you're off. Kelly called me. Kelly. I spoke to Stavros. He told me, you know, about the file. Do me a favor kid. Go home. What if I don't wanna go home? You know what they're gonna do to me. They did... many years ago. You? You just start now. Go home. Do I look worried to you? I appreciate that. Half a dollar for a cup of coffee? Come on, let's get out of here. Let me try this : What would you say if I told you Peter Barak is our man? Barak? He's been our man all along. Look Lieutenant, I'm sorry. Yeah. There's some place out there Barak and Buchardt are looking to kill each other. Where do we go now? Well I've been to his home, he's not there. We'll try his office. Peter not knows that we know about Buchardt. So time is a factor. He'll be taking risks. - To find Buchardt? Well alright, you're Peter Barak, you know somebody's looking for you, and you're looking to find him, so what do you do? I'd show up, make myself conspicuous. Right. You know, I gotta believe sooner or later he's got to show up workplace or another. And so will Buchardt. And so Buchardt. There he is. Go, quick! Barak! Barak! You want me, Barak? Here I am! Barak! Barak! Barak! Barak! What's that over there? Peter! Police, drop it! Drop it! Drop it, Barak! Peter! Theo! Peter, put that gun down. Give me a reason, Theo. It isn't worth it. He's an insult. How you any idea how hard I tried, to make them do something? To arrest them,, make them pay. This isn't the way. So what is the way, Theo? You just don't kill people! I am protected by the government.. of the United States of America! Drop it! Drop it! I am...protected... by the government of the United...

They're Federal marshals. Excuse me. So what we're gonna do with them? Make a deal, deport them, dump them in the river? Something like that. Anything to keep them from telling the story to trial right? Theo, it's... I'm waiting. You know what the stakes were. Why don't you tell me about it? No, no. You tell me what our country stands for. It's wrong. It's.... it's very wrong. What are you gonna do about it? Nothing. I'm new to courage Theo. I've gone as far as I can go for now. What you're gonna do? - Me? These people spit on the graves of kids who died fighting against Hitler, and they covered it up for 40 years. And they're still covering it up. What I'm gonna do? I'll do what I have to do.
