[crickets chirping] [owl hooting] [birds chirping] [monkeys screeching] [Daeng] Pran Boon! Where are you? Pran Boon, help! Pran Boon, where are you? Help! Who's there? It's me, Daeng. Is that you? Pran Tin? The tiger took Aunt Maew's son into the jungle. What are you doing here in the middle of the night? I came to get Pran Boon's help. Didn't you say that you and your wife are going to visit her mother at Ban Nua Nam? Boon Mee? [Daeng grunts] It's me, Daeng, not Uncle Boon Mee. [Sming growls] -[growls] -[Daeng screams] [growls] [Daeng groans] [Daeng grunts] -[growling] -[gunshot] [Daeng] Pran Boon. Thank God, it's you! What happened? I'm so confused. [Pran Boon] Sming tigers, both mother and son, they use illusions to lure victims. Pran Tin was killed by it behind that tree. [sniffs] [Sming snarling] [bushes rustling] [Daeng screams] -[gunshot] -[Sming growls] Is it still around? [Pran Boon] No. It's gone. Phew! I really didn't think we'd make it! I didn't think it would have left so easily. I wonder where it's going? Let's head back to the village, Daeng. I've got a bad feeling. [Sming snarling] [snarls] Oh, God, my baby. [cries] -[bell jingling] -[Sming snarling] [cow moos] [Sming snarls] [Prang] Lumduan, wake up. Come help me make breakfast. I'm already up... who can sleep at a time like this? [dog barks] [growls] Darng! What are you barking at? You'll wake up the entire village. [dog whines] Darng? Are you okay? Darng? Darng? Darng! What is it, Mom? Get back. [Sming snarling] Who is it? What do you want? [speaking in Khmer] [Prang] What did you say? I don't understand [inaudible] -[Sming growls] -[Prang screams] [Prang whimpers] Mom! Mom, help me. Mom! [Prang] You demon... leave my baby alone! [growls] Mom! Mom. Mom! [Lumduan crying] Fire! Fire! [people yelling] [Lumduan] Help! Help me! [Pran Boon] Lumduan! Lumduan! [Lumduan] Dad! [man] No, Pran Boon! Don't go in! No, let me go! No, it's too dangerous! -[Lumduan] Dad! -[Pran Boon] Lumduan! [Lumduan] Dad! Dad! [Pran Boon] Lumduan, where are you? -[Lumduan] Dad! -[Pran Boon coughs] [Pran Boon] Lumduan! Where are you? Lumduan! Lumduan! Talk to me, Lumduan! Lhong... take care of my baby. I'm killing that beast, if it's the last thing I do. Wait, give me my gun. I'm coming with you. No. It could come back. Lhong, brother... don't believe in what you see... it's a Sming. This can't be good... perhaps it's destined that we shall meet again. [Lumduan] Mom! [Pran Boon] Lumduan! [Lumduan] Dad! Dad! [Pran Boon] Don't believe in what you see... it's a Sming. [Sming growls] Why have you come to see me so early in the morning, lady? [Sming growling] Show yourself! [Sming growls] Come and fight me! -You can't hide forever! -[Sming growling] Come and fight me! [Sming growling] Prang! [panting] [snarling] Come back... come back... come back! Come back! [indistinct chatter] [camera clicks] [camera clicks] [man] Coffee! Tea! Shakes! Delicious, refreshing goodness! [officer] Keep it down! This is a government building. [man] Hey, I pay tax too! When you're at my store, you never shut up. -I never tell you to keep it down! -If you don't believe me, go ask him! Sit down! No one wants to hear your excuses! The evidence is right there! I've got nothing to do with it! [camera clicks] Excuse me. Can I help you? I'm here to report in for duty. Here are my documents. The new ranger? You look like a baby! Put the camera away and follow me. -Thank you, ma'am. -No worries, I like to help. [Nid Noi] Kid! What are you doing here? [counselor] Nid Noi, what is this? Couples bickering and you send them to me. Missing animals cases and you send them to me. What do you think I am? A marriage counselor or a police officer? So what's with this "man-eating tiger" kid? Come out and elaborate... stop hiding, both of you! Chief Lhong said it's a Sming Sir, not a tiger. Sming, tiger, whatever. What's the fuss all about? Your village is called the 'Hunters Village', is it not? So where are all your hunters? You honestly can't deal with this yourselves? Are you reporting in for duty? -Yes sir. -What's your name? -My name-- -Surachard Penghorm. Good. Here's your first assignment. Go with the boy and see what the big deal is, find a solution and report back to me. Uh... yes, sir. So how do we get to this 'Hunters Village'? We hitch a ride. That's how I got here. Hitch a ride? Really? [John] Excuse me, are you going to the Hunters Village? I'm a mechanic... I like the jungle. I've lived in Thailand for four years. Thank you for letting us tag along. Not at all, we're the ones that should be thanking you. You're welcome. I hope you guys aren't hunters... because my job is not to hunt but to stop hunting. Certainly... [speaking English] Excuse me. Are you ladies ready or what? Uh! Yeah... Yeah, we're all loaded up. [speaking Thai] We are ready to go. Okay. Where is Daeng? [speaking English] If you are looking for the little boy, he is in the toilet. [speaking Thai] Oh, thanks. [Daeng screams] It's time to go. [Chart] Chapter one. My first day on duty has become an unexpected adventure, an exciting surprise. I don't know what I will face... but deep down inside, I know that this is what I've been waiting for my entire life. Daeng said the village isn't far from here. Any chance we can take the car? -What do you reckon, Daeng? -There is, but we have to go around the mountains... and we won't make it there before sunset. [speaking English] Okay... [speaking Thai] I get it. [Tom speaking English] Hey, Ben, be careful! [Ben] They are guns, they can take it. Catch. [chuckles] Oh, yeah! There is my baby. [laughs] All right... relax, man. [speaking Thai] I'm a scaredy cat, all right? [Tom singing] [Daeng] This is the jungle. Keep it down. [Tom singing] [Ben speaking English] Hey, hey, Tom! I think this kid's telling you to shut up... so shut the hell up! [Ben laughing] I like this kid. [Daeng speaking Thai] Chart! Try to keep up with us, will you? Daeng, we sent you to go get help! Why'd you come back with tourists? Oi! Oi [hissing] He's come here to shoot the Sming with a camera. Great. Auntie! What's for dinner? [speaking English] Wow... well, I think we are pretty much on our own here, mate. I don't think they like our ranger very much. I tell you what, let's, um-- Let's get the vehicle tomorrow. in the mean time we'll, uh, make camp out here somewhere. I don't wanna be around these people, come on! I don't wanna be too touchy with these people either. Aw, but I do, check her out. Hey, baby! How's it going? [speaking Thai] Tell your friends not to camp too far from our village, it is not safe. I doubt they'd listen... and judging from their weapons... I don't think we need to worry. You can stay with Prean tonight, after the fire, Lumduan has been staying with me. -Is that okay with you Prean? -No problem, chief! We'll trek out into the jungle first thing tomorrow. I'll show you the latest incident. -Sure. -Let's go, Mr. Ranger. Prean's accent might need some getting used to. He is a Cambodian refugee. Thai, Westerners, Chinese and Cambodians. Is this the United Nations? Who are you? Help me! What the... [creature shrieks] Mr. ranger, wake up, wake up. Chief Lhong is on his way here. Hurry up, it's morning already. [Chart] You call this morning? [yawns] [Chart] Sometimes, in the jungle... the difference between life and death... is merely the directions of the wind. Therefore, it is absolutely critical... you know which way the wind blows. This happened only yesterday. It killed a hunter from the village up the river who came to hunt it. Where is the body, Chief? Buried over there, what was left of him, at least. How do you know it's one animal? Judging from its trail, the paw prints and bite marks, there's no doubt it's one tiger. What about the other bodies? Which one? There are over 30 of them. It's been killing everyday for the past month. Mostly hunters from other places looking for fame. Our villagers are safe mostly. -We're smarter than to go after it. -[growls] Hey! Chief! What was that sound? Firebull. It's been spotted around the borders a few days ago. Firebull? What's that? I've never seen them either. I've only heard the stories... I'll tell you later. For now let's just focus on the Sming. Firebull story? So... [Chief Lhong] Black Magic. The Khmer Hunter has been here a few days. He claims the Sming as his. He followed it from the Cambodian forest. -[speaking in Khmer] -[Sming growls] Sming is mine. If you want to live... stay away! [growling] What did he say? It's Khmer, I don't know. Only Prean can understand. Don't shoot! It's me, Prean! [Chart] The Khmer hunter is like the wizard of the jungle. What Prean revealed was as intriguing as it was terrifying. It was not always a Sming... it was once a tiger who was abused by its master. Eventually, it snapped... ate the Khmer Hunter's wife alive. It's become Sming ever since... free from the Khmer Hunter's spell... the Sming broke free and fled. Come and eat, my child. -[growls] -[screams] Karma had brutally caught up with the hunter and his wife. This event marked the beginning of the jungle's darkest days. So does this mean that the Sming is killing to harvest souls and keep them enslaved? Yes. I guess... that's how it takes the shape of its previous kills. But what if it doesn't know that it killed the victim? Who knows? If it doesn't know, it probably has no control. [woman screams] More trouble. Ranger, keep an eye on Lumduan! No, wait! Please save my wife. [woman screams] Heads up! Big brother. Big brother! -[woman screams] -[Sming growls] Big brother. Big brother. -Pui! -C'mon! -Oi! -Let go! Pui, take her back to the village! Lumduan, you too! It's not safe here. Go! This is it. [growls] -Big brother! -Big brother! -Big brother! -Big brother! -Hey! -[Sming growls] Big brother. Are you okay? I'm fine. Go! Don't let it get away! Yes, brother! [speaking English] Wow, it sounds like somebody got lucky today... or maybe it's you, Daeng. Thank you, thank you. [grunting] [speaking Thai] I am Pran Dum... the Sming Slayer. [Pran Boon] This isn't the one eyed Sming. It has one too many eyes. Dad! Pran Boon? [Ben] Aw! What a shame aye! They fucking ruined it. Yeah there is no fun in keeping a head that you didn't hunt, is it? How long have you been training with us? You know the importance of the mask in combat! Revealing your eyes... your expression... could've been a fatal mistake for Big Brother! The Chinese believe that to defeat a demon tiger, it takes five siblings of the same womb. The blood tie allow for perfect synchronicity but more importantly, in a dire situation, they will never leave anyone behind. Their strategy is... to distract a limb each... and when the critical moment presents itself, the oldest brother will go in for the kill stabbing the tiger's heart through its back. Stab the heart from behind? Is that possible? Um, how would they know where to aim for? Big brother, second brother, brothers. Please accept my apology. I'm still not good enough. That's enough! You just need more practice! Look at our youngest brother all grown up! Ar Pho! Come, come, come! These are my brothers from China! Oh, hello everyone! These two look like twins! Am I right? -Look at their matching braids! -Ooh! [laughing] Notice between these two ribs here. If you stab through here, you'll sever the pulmonary artery. and if you stab through here, the blade will go right through its heart. Either will be fatal. Oh, that's pretty simple actually! It's just a couple of inches above... the center of its body. Plus, there are two entry points! Look at you talking all big! We all know that when the time comes, you'll run, tail between your legs, crying back home! What's your problem? You do realize, I'm Pran Boon's daughter, right? -I have to leave now. -Oh. I thought you were back to be with Lumduan? I can't. Not yet. Sming is after the both of us, as long as it's still out there, I'm not safe. Lumduan, why does he carry that sheath without the blade? He does realize it's empty. He lost it when he fought the Sming at the river side. -God, you're nosy! -Lumduan, check this out... I took the foreign hunters to set traps, and they gave this to me as a reward! All the preparations and weapons, all came down to just hunting a rabbit? So they aren't hunting Sming anymore? Hey... fine... I still wanted to talk... The gun powder is an important element. Everyone has their own mixture. The wrong mixture will explode in your face! It's a careful process. My favorite is... Pran Boon's recipe. Very powerful and not much smoke. But god damn, it's deafeningly loud! Now today we'll try my new mixture... even better than Pran Boon's! Prean, are you sure that this gun still functions? My head as your guarantee, Ranger! Now, watch this. -Oh no! -[gunshot fires] [distant growling] [howling] [animals calling] [Sming growling] It's close, it's real close! You stay home, alone.... you must close... [Sming snarling] [man cries] [Chart] Ar Pho and his wife were found dead two days later, almost uneaten. It looks as if, it's only killing for the sake of killing now. Oi... this mine... yours there! Fine, take it... son! -Missing home? -Big Brother! Sit, sit. Yeah, I guess, a little bit. I was like you too when I first moved here... everything is so different. The birds look different, the animals aren't like the ones we hunt. They speak a strange language and their thoughts stranger... I never get their jokes... and our jokes terrifies them. So, I only planned to stay a short while, just to understand the world to understand them. I thought I'd go home once I did. [brother] So what happened? What made you change your mind? Because I now understand them. Don't worry little brother... one day I will come home. Who knows? Maybe after this madness is over! Sounds good? Yes, Big Brother. About the mask today, don't be discouraged. Everyone makes mistakes. One day, when your heart is strong enough you won't need the mask anymore. [speaking English] What's he doing? Why doesn't he take the shot? [speaking Thai] No, Mr. John, it's still too young. Baby, baby understand? [speaking English] Come on, man, what are you waiting for? Hey! What are you doing? [speaking Thai] It's big enough! It isn't a baby anymore. No, don't, it's still young! [gunshot] [John speaking English] What the fuck are you lot doing? God damn it, that one was mine! [howls] [howls] [man speaking Thai] Ah, there you are, Kaew. I've been looking all over for you. I think we should stop meeting this way, it's not safe... I have a bad feeling about it. What if I spoke to your parents and asked for your hand in marriage? What is the matter with you? You're repeating the exact same thing, you said yesterday. You sound like a broken record! I've already told you that it's up to you. [Kaew shrieking] You were right... it's still too young. I'm sorry. No Problem Mr. John. Hey John, no hard feelings, aye. Idiot! It was too small, now you are gonna carry that back to camp yourselves. -Hello! -[Sming growling] Ni hao, ni how? More like 'ni-what-are-you-saying'? [indistinct chatter] [Sming snarling] -[Sming snarls] -[dog whimpers] [grunts] [John speaking English] I see you ladies have set a trap. How many times have I told you that the gun is the only fair way to hell. You young bucks never learn, now, do you, ey, you fucking know it all. [chuckles] Well... one day you'll see, my friend. One day, you'll see what this fucking Iceman-- -[trap springs] -Come on, give me a hand. Fucking rat piss. Oh, well... [laughing] You are the dumbest son of a bitch I have ever fucking seen. Possibly the finest catch you've had all year, man. -Well done, lad! -God damn it, Tom! Help me with this, ey? The little bastard is heavy as a sack of rocks. Come on, will you? -[Tom] Okay, okay. -[Ben] Grab the other hand. Hey, Daeng... [speaking Thai] I hope tonight's staking out is still on? [speaking English] Yes, sir! Dismissed, private. [woman] Boon... [weeping] Boon... [speaking Thai] Help me, please! Help me please! -Prang. -[woman] Help me please! Help me, please... -Help me, please! -[screams] [speaking English] Do you think it's a good idea to let Ben be with Daeng? [scoffs] I don't know, he says he wants to run the hunt Thai style at night... he thinks that gives good luck, you know. God damn it, no fucking animals at all. I thought you'd be my lucky charm, Daeng, boy, was I wrong. [speaking Thai] Will you stop barking, Ben? Ah, why'd I bring a little bitch with me? [sighs] What have I ever done to deserve this? Shush! You understand this at least? Shush! [speaking English Ngeīyb, ngeīyb. Okay, ngeīyb, ngeīyb, shut the hell up, right? I get it. I get it. [scoffs] Mouthy kid. Hey, lady! What the hell are you doing out here in the middle of the night, aye? You could have been killed, you know? Kaew! [speaking Thai] What's the matter with you? You're repeating the exact same thing you said yesterday. [speaking English] You talking to me? [speaking Thai] You sound like a broken record. No, Mr. Ben, don't follow it! [speaking English] Get out of my way, kid. I'm going hunting for a new kind of prey. Ngeīyb, ngeīyb, understand? Ngeīyb, ngeīyb. [speaking Thai] Don't! Mr. Ben! Come back up here. Don't go. It isn't human. [speaking English] Shut the hell up. Mouthy kid. [speaking Thai] Come back up here. Don't go. [speaking English] What the hell is he doing? I don't know, maybe he's got something. [Daeng speaking Thai] Help! Mr. John, help! [speaking English] This is not good. You go get Daeng, I'll take care of Ben. [Tom] Hold your breath, kid. I'm coming. Oh, shit! Son of a-- Son of a bitch. Hey! God damn it, lady, stop-- Fuck! Shit! I get it, baby. Enough with this shit... you better stay hidden, bitch, 'cause if I find you, I'm gonna fucking kill you. You got that? I'm gonna kill ya! -[growls] -[gunshot] Ben... are you okay, man? Jesus Christ almighty. Where are you, Ben? Are you all right, Ben? Are you hurt? Did you get the tiger? God dammit, Tom! Help me with this, ey? John! It's John! What the hell is wrong with you? The little bastard's heavier than a sack of rocks. Come on, will you? -[cracking] -[screams] Oh, Christ. Ben, you bastard, you'll pay for that. [growls] [screams] [breathes heavily] -[screams continue] -[Sming snarls] -[gunshot] -[growls] Daeng, run to the car, come on! [gunshot] [gunshots] -[gun clicks] -Oh, shit! The car! Run to the car. [growls] [gasps] [growls] [John] Help! Help me! [speaking Thai] Little Dum! Little Dum! Where are you, boy? Kaew, no, my baby! Don't leave me this way! -[camera clicks] -[crying] -Chief!! -What? What is it, Prean? [panting] The foreign hunters, they are all dead. What? What about Daeng? He went with them! I didn't see him. Chief... what do we do? We need to find Daeng now. All right. I'll go back to the foreigner hunters' bodies. Find the key and drive in to town to get help. I believe I have enough evidence. It's Daeng! What, where? Lumduan, take this. Don't believe in what you see. Wait! It might be the Sming. Sming. Of course. Let me! No, Pran Dum, don't! Chart, go! Prean! Gun! But what if it's really the Sming? We'll soon find out No! Dum, no! You better not miss, Chief! Stop! Daeng! Daeng! Sming... I saw Sming. It's Pran, Pran-- Which hunter? Daeng! [Khmer hunter] The Khmer hunter! [speaking in Khmer] [Sming snarls] It's really him. Don't follow him! The mist is too thick! Prean, go get my brothers. [growling] What's the matter with you? You're repeating the exact same thing, you said yesterday. You sound like a broken record-- Let's go Ready? [Prean] Hang on, Mr. Ranger Prean! Please don't stop me. I know, Chief Lhong doesn't want anyone to go because it's dangerous-- No. I'm not here to stop you. I just wanted to give you this... it may only fire one shot but one shot is better than no shots. I've fixed up my mixture... I guarantee, it won't explode in your face! Thanks, Prean. Prean please take care of this for me. Hey-- You think you're better than me? Let's see you beating this! [Sming snarls] You sure you wanna take me on, demon? You're out of tricks now, aren't you? Bring it! [Sming snarls] [Sming snarls] Wrong turn. I'm not sure you wanna use Prean's gun Here, take this. It's my dad's. How did she get here? Lumduan, wait for me! [howls] [howls] [howls] [howling] Wait! This is not it, let it go. [Sming snarls] Could that be it, Big Brother? -Put on your masks, let's go find out. -Yes. [howls] Ar Pho! -[howls] -[howls] Little brother, look out! Big Brother! I'm stuck. Big Brother! Big Brother! [man] Big Brother! [growls] [man] No, let it go. Big Brother! Stay with me, Big Brother! I'm sorry, it's all my fault. Don't blame yourself. You did your best. You are very brave. I'm proud of you. Big Brother! Big Brother! Big Brother! [crying] Big Brother! The Khmer hunter! [Lumduan] Dad! Pran Boon! Come. It's around here. I've been tracking it all day. Come, Ranger! Here's where my dad fought the Sming and took out its eye. What's that? One day, I'll be a photographer in the big city! Look! What's that? It's the Khmer Hunter! But I thought he was the Sming? What was he saying before then? That's the knife that my dad lost, when he fought the Sming! Really? He said... "it's not me, it's not me. The hunter is hunting himself." It's stuck. Chart, I-- I don't understand. Your dad-- your dad is dead, Lumduan! Come back. Come back. [screams] [Pran Boon] Don't believe in what you see... it's a Sming. -I saw Sming. -[Pran Boon] The hunter is inside. It's a Sming Dad... Lumduan... Run! Run for your life! -Dad! Dad! -Lumduan run! Go! Chart! [Chart] I'm sorry, Lumduan. Dad. Chief Lhong! I'm glad you're here. -We have so much to tell. -Chart! The Sming is still alive! Lumduan, run away! Chart! Run away! Come on! Bring it! Chart, look out! Come! Chart! [Pran Boon] One day, when your heart is strong enough, you won't need the mask anymore. [growls] [Chart] Lumduan, no! Run away. Go, Lumduan! Run away! Run away, Lumduan. Run! Dad... daddy... please help us... Lumduan, hurry! Stab the tiger's heart through its back! Remember? What about my dad? He's still trapped! Dad! Lumduan, hurry! Your dad can't hold the Sming much longer! I wonder if that's mom and dad. Yes, I know it! Big Brother has been away for so long. Now it's time for him to come home. He's always taken care of us, now he can finally rest. Are you sure? Are you sure you want to do this? Yes, I am. I would like to continue his legacy. If that is your wish. You are among Big Brother's friends, I know you'll do great here. Whenever you need us we will be at your side. Thank you, second brother. Thank you, third brother. There's one more thing. This mask... I will no longer need it. Of course. I have faith in you. [speaking English] Come on, guys! Let's go. I'm ready to give you a drive to China. What am I doing? You don't understand me anyways. Hey, take good care of my brothers or else I'll kick your ass. Hoo! You speak English? How come you never tell me? You never asked. Go, go! Bye-bye, good bye! [speaking Thai] Visit us! -[speaking English] Bye-bye. -Bye-bye. [speaking Thai] Lumduan, is Chart really staying? The Ranger? [Chart] Summary of the first chapter. So I've decided to stay... as there is so much more waiting to be discovered here. I am now ready, to begin the next chapter. [chuckles] I guess he's finally found himself. Daeng, hurry! Follow me! We'll finally get to see it this time! Hurry! Follow me! [Daeng] Again with the camera! People need to carry guns! -What are you gonna do with that thing? -[screeching] [grunts] Shoot!
