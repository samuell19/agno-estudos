Come forward! There's Zorro! We found him! Sword! Sword! Sword! What... What did you do? Who will tell Don Diego? The situation is intolerable. If Zorro doesn't come in a hurry, we're ruined. It gets worse every day. Such a disgusting scene. If it hadn't been for friar Miguel, Ruarte would have left me naked in the middle of the square. It's unheard of! Finally! Well? What's the news on Zorro? Tell me. - You don't... You, speak! - What is he saying? One is deaf and the other is mute. Did you find Zorro or not? - Yes. - Did he say when he'd come? It would take a miracle. - No. He said that... - What did he say? If Zorro doesn't come, I won't love him anymore. He will be dead for me. For us too! No... For everyone. Don't worry, Zaira. Luckily, in a few days my nephew Paco is returning from Europe after 15 long years of absence. He's as courageous, as invincible as Zorro. A living sword's blade! He will be my revenger. Do you mean it, Father? Tell me about him. What's he like? What's he like? He's handsome, strong, courageous. My own flesh and blood! Perk up your morale. Paco is coming! Paco is coming, brothers! Understand? Paco is coming! Happy, huh? Finally Paco is coming. A nice smile, granny! Your troubles are over. Hello. The carriage is coming! The carriage is coming! Here it is! He's coming! Come! Is he the revenger? Your hand, please. Ladies and gentlemen! I just arrived with the carriage! You're certainly asking yourselves why I'm wearing these clothes. I was robbed by bandits, awful looking guys! They took my clothes, money, everything! Why doesn't the police intervene? Are its hands tied? I'm talking to you. We'll discuss it later. Now please excuse me. - You're Uncle Diego, aren't you? - Yes. Handsome! Very handsome! You have aged a bit. You've a little tummy, you rascal! But don't worry. I'll suggest a medicine to make you lose weight. - Who is he? - Friar Miguel. The little friar! - Peace, good will. Who's the woman? - She's your cousin Zaira. You don't say! You've come a long way. When I left you were this little! Like a small monkey. This is the revenger, Mr. Franquines, the protector of the people? "Backup is coming!" Miss Zaira, I congratulate you on your betrothed. But don't worry. I will never have you marry such a clown. I will be your spouse, whether you want it or not. Who is that tin soldier on horseback who dares say certain things without introducing himself? Why are you laughing? Are these scoundrels continuing? - Let's go! - Take them away! I don't understand. Where is he going? Little friar! Go! Go back home! Go away! Go! - Slaps, kicks... - Zaira, let's go. Where are we? - Sir, we are here at your service. - Are you my servant? Are you here to serve me, too? Why doesn't he speak? Is he mute? - Why doesn't he speak? He's mute? - I am deaf. Lovely family! Deaf, mute. Are we waiting for a blind man? Don't get discouraged, dear. Zorro will return, I'm sure. My heart cannot be wrong. He will return soon. Zorro will return. That's it. Sing! You must be cheerful. It's incredible! I never would've imagined that my nephew would ridicule the name of the Franquines! - What are you doing? - A "depilé". I spent so much money to make a gentleman out of you, and you show up in my home in your underclothes! I said it 1,000 times, "mon oncle". I was robbed by bandits. - Couldn't you defend yourself? - Me? I hate violence! - Weapons are dangerous. - What? Then why do you have a sword? Just to look good? No. I clean my fingernails with it. - It's perfect. - Oh, my God... - Want to take advantage, mon oncle? - No! Oh, my little cousin! I warn you. I have no intention of spending time with you. Why do you treat me so badly, cousin? Because you're unpleasant, brazen and even a bit of a fag. What? Me, a fag? I am refined, because I was in Paris where I studied in the best boarding schools to become a real gentleman. Fag! Fag! You insolent ugly parrot! If you do it again, I'll claw you. You take it out on a poor helpless animal, but in front of Ruarte, you trembled! - Don't make me laugh. What kind of man are you? What're you waiting for to challenge him? I just arrived, dear cousin. Let me get oriented, and you'll see. Did you hear what he said? He plans on marrying me. Too bad for him. If someone is to marry you, it's me. Mon oncle promised you to me in one of his letters. You think I'd marry someone like you? Why? What is wrong with me? Take a good look. I would marry only one man without hesitation. - Who is he? - Zorro. Sorrow? Tell me about this Sorrow. Talk to me about him. If you were worth only half of Zorro, I'd be happy to have you as a cousin, and marry you. - Who can this Zorro be? Hercules? - More than that! - Maciste? - More! - Samson? - More! - Stop it, ugly parrot! - You're ugly, too! - I'll throw my slippers at you! - You're brave. Hit him! I could slap him if I wanted! - I'll rip your hand off. - How ill-mannered! I'm leaving. Ruarte wants to marry Zaira. I want to marry Zaira. Zaira wants to marry Zorro. No. Zaira belongs to me. She's mine. I'll cause a massacre! Swindlers! They won't be able to steal her. Zaira is mine. Nobody can touch her! I'll kill whoever gets near her. I'll kick his ass! Like this! Like this... It's not so bad! The sword. I'd like to duel. En guarde, guard! Gentlemen. Missed? Please. Go! But... it's Paco. The lamp fell on his head. Come. Help me put him to bed. Ready? One, two and three! Three! Three! Up! Where are you? There you are! Not you on the bed! Him! Ready? Up! Up... Down! I realized immediately it wasn't Zorro. He doesn't look like him. What's he saying? Mr. Paco, do you feel well? But... He's a sleepwalker! Don't talk! If you wake up a sleepwalker, he could die! One, two! One, two! One, two! One, two! One, two! One, two! Halt! It's fatso. Come. Get him! Drink with me! Hurry, come! Bravo, Zorro! The sign of Zorro! Let's run! Where are you running to? Stop! Let's get him. - My ass... my ass... - Easy. Miss Zaira. Zorro is fine, don't worry. He said he would return. He went that way. - When is he returning? - I can't hear you. Excuse me. My love, come back soon. I love you. There... Not here! Not here! We have to get rid of this outfit. He must not find it. If he asks for it, we'll say he dreamed it. As of this moment, we can have Zorro whenever we want. With a few of Don Diego's sleeping drops, Zorro will come to the rescue of the people. - It's true. I recognize it. - You don't know how to read! It's his! The only letter that has remained in my head. Hadn't you understood, idiot? It's Zorro! Cheers for the governor! - Thank you! Thank you! - They said "the governor". - Oh, excuse me. - Thank you! Silence! Silence! Unfortunately, I am no longer your governor. - I'm just a poor "ex"! - You are still our leader! - Our head! - Yes, but what head am I? - A shit... - Silence! Cheers for the governor! I... Ruarte, governor of New Aragon, want to inform my subjects that I've put out a bounty of 50 escudos on Zorro! That scoundrel dared soil the walls of my city, going against the norms that safeguard public order. He even smudged the faces of your filthy soldiers. Let's hope he smudges yours, too, with all the letters of the alphabet! - Arrest that friar! - Arrest that rebel! Arrest him! Stop it! You're fighting with friars? Stop! Take it easy, brothers. Take it easy! Stop! Stop! Kneel in front of the crucifix! Kiss. It is something sacred! You kiss too! Penance! Penance! - Zorro could've defeated them! - I'm sick of this Zorro! One day I'll kick his ass up to your window! Go ahead and laugh! - Oh, excuse me! - Get him! What is it? Because of his insolence, tomorrow Friar Miguel will receive 12 whippings on the public square! - Disbelievers! - You are all invited! The performance is free. See how much your nonsense costs us? Not at all! The performance is free. - Goodbye! - I will be there! Make way! Make way! Sit down. - May I talk? - Go ahead. I heard that Governor Ruarte put out a bounty of 50 escudos for the capture of Zorro. I'll put 50 Euros too. - You have some information? - No, I have... Excuse me. I have a bad cold. I propose a historic compromise. You will deliver Zorro to me as soon as he's captured, so that I can ridicule him in front of everyone, and the 50 escudos are yours. Can it be done? - It can be done, friend. - It can be done. But we'll lend him to you. You must return him to us. Ruarte is generous. He can't deprive the people of his hanging. There is little entertainment in town. But... - How will you capture him? - Watch! Like this! Mr. Garcia, what game are we playing? As soon as I will meet Zorro... But.. But... - I'll deliver him in underpants! - Him! What've I go to do with it? Thank you. Why are you laughing? Idiots! Idiots! He is waking up. I am Zorro! Let's dress him. Hurry. "Zorrito", come this way. Zaira is over here. I'll accompany you. - Zorrito! This way, this way! - Where is he? Zorrito! This way! Zaira is over there. Zaira, I came to free you. Where are you? - Friar Miguel! - Zaira... I am here! Brother, what a pleasure! Zorro? Thank you, Zorro. No. What did you understand? I'm a friar but not... Run, friar Miguel! Beautiful, beautiful! - Let me go! - I apologize, miss, for my men's brusque behavior. See these two gallows, dear? You are trying to scare me. You can kill me, so finally it will be over! No, you misunderstood. I only wanted to propose something. You either marry me or tomorrow, hanging from these two gallows, will be the bodies of your father and that saintly man, friar Miguel. - This is blackmail! - Precisely. No, Zaira! Don't give in! I am not afraid of dying! Zaira, think about it! I must do more good deeds on this Earth. There's still time to die. Good afternoon. What lovely people! What a festive atmosphere! Is it the town feast? No. There isn't a feast. He asked me to marry him. If I don't, he will kill my father and friar Miguel. It's not possible, dear governor. You can't marry my cousin. She was promised to me. If someone will marry her, that's me. Finally you have decided to defend me! - Dear Mr. Paco... - What is it? In this region, only I make promises. Obviously, I don't keep them. Otherwise, what dictator am I? But I demand respect of my rights. - Bravo. - Thank you. Mr. Governor, read the contents of this letter. It is a valid marriage promise. Mr. Paco, you want to see what I'll do with your uncle's letter? - Show. - I'll do this, and this. I protest! It is an abuse, it's illegal. I am marrying this woman, if it should cost my life! Then I'll please you. Executioner! A third gallows for Mr. Paco. Forget it. The matter doesn't concern me. Continue your conversation. Pardon the interruption. Wise guy! Bye bye. Best wishes. Go ahead and talk! I'll pack my bags and leave! So... The executioner or the priest? The priest, and may you be damned! - To the spouse's health! - Cheers! This is it, Mother. As of tomorrow my position will be official, legitimate. Besides that, we can free ourselves of our last enemy. - Zorro? - Exactly. Tomorrow I'll catch two birds with the usual stone. I'll marry Zaira and will set a trap for Zorro. - Why? - You'll catch 3 pigeons, son. In capturing Zorro, we'll automatically take back possession of our jewels. - Exactly, Mother! I am sure that adventurer is in love with Zaira. As soon as he finds out about the wedding, he'll show up. Good! We'll be ready to receive him. Zorro is making you look like fools, like ignorant men! Evidence shows he knows how to write the letters of the alphabet with the tip of his sword. It's time that you learned how to write too. Otherwise, what impression will you give the people? What is it, Fernandez? We don't know how to write, but the people can't read. - He's right! - Silence! That is true, too. But it knows how to read the letter "Z"! And that is intolerable! I demand that from now on it will know how to read the letter "R" too! - Why is that? - It stands for Ruarte, lord and master of the entire colony. Is that clear? In reading the "R", the people must tremble, piss in their pants, cry out in fear. Is that clear? And now... help me get off! Go! Now I'll show you how to write the letter "R". - Garcia, the sword with chalk. - Yes, sir. Perfect. So, as you see, the "R" is made up of a vertical line. Like this! Then a half circle. Easy. And finally... a curl. It can't be any easier. Alright, boys. I'd like to question and verify... You must always pee when you're to be questioned. Later Mario Marianez! Instead... Get your hands away from your nose! - Come on, Osiride Vivarelli. - I can't hold it anymore. Try. Write. So... A vertical line. A half circle. Go behind the blackboard until the end of the lesson. Don't move! - Why are you laughing? - I'm not laughing. - You try. You try! - I am in charge of erasing. That is true. You come forward. Write. Vertical line. Vertical line... You need another blackboard? A short line. A curl. Curls... To the right. A very short line. Behind the blackboard! You won't go behind the blackboard because you're a cardinal's nephew. Say hello to him for me. My respects. Go back to your place. What disgusting students! - I should fail all of you! - Excuse me! May I come in? Come forward. Come forward. Thank you. You go away! Look who's here, the revenger! Well? What do you want? Well said. I came here for revenge. You're telling me so brazenly? No. Me challenge you? The usurper? - Usurper? - It's what they say in town. I'm not worried about you. My cousin rejects you every day. You're not an obstacle for me. I must admit you have guts. Yes, guts. They keep churning. It's Zorro's fault. Zorro in the morning, Zorro in the evening, Zorro at night! Governor, you know what a melon is? - Well? - Zorro's a pain in the melon for me. - That's a good one. - I would like you to help me. Doing what? You are so modest. You're the best blade in the region. Modestly speaking! Teach me to fence, "s'il vous plait". - S'il vous plait? - Plait! It's French. - Teach you to fence? Me? - Yes. Why not? Give him a sword. Darn! Imbeciles! Imbeciles! I said one sword! Oh, look! Excuse me. A sword in his nose. Whoever did it, will be tortured! Poor things. They didn't do it on purpose. - Incompetent idiots! - Forgive them, Governor. - They are just poor boys. - They are soldiers! A guest is not treated like this! Look! They did it by mistake. - Just a moment! - What is it? We'll do things properly now! Go! Go get the practice sword. Understand? Yes, right away. - He is a poor soul... - No, he isn't! - They are like... - Like what? Like that. They wanted to give me the sword, a sign of affection. Attention! - You want to whip them? - No, I hate violence! You shouldn't whip soldiers, but respect them. They should be treated with kindness. Get the swords! - To you. - Please. And now the lesson. Give me the sword. Let's begin. First of all, we greet the adversary. The spectators on the left and the spectators on the right. Then we put the sword on one side and position ourselves en garde. Carry on. Not bad. You must learn the first slashes. Fifth! Alright? Flank and fence off. Carry on. Fifth! - Alright. - Flank! - Fence! How am I doing? - Very well. Bravo! Very good. It's the first time. And now... lunge! Lunge, fifth! Carry on. Lunge! Lunge! Fifth! Bravo! You like it? You like it? - Very much. Shall I attack? - Attack. - What if I hurt him? - Attack! - Will you allow me? - With pleasure, sir! Watch out, Garcia! I'll slash! Very good! Don't be a sissy, Mr. Paco! More of a man! You'll see now! Garcia, it's over for you. Come on, lunge. Be a man! Go on! Garcia, I'm lunging! - What is it? - You killed me. - Killed? - Why? I don't know! - I killed him. - You killed him! - How? - The blade remained in his stomach. - His stomach... - Murderer! Oh, God, I'm fainting! I'm fainting. I can't go on. Be a man! Give him something! Go on! You're giving him a banana? Don't give him an apple! Give him something to drink. Enough. How's it going? - Better? - Yes, thank you. - Better? - I feel better. - You feel lighter? - Yes, I feel lighter. - Good. Skin him alive! - Murderer! - But... But... - It was a joke. A joke? A joke... I knew it. - May I go? - Yes. At the end on the right. He didn't understand a thing! Here, Father. The food friar Miguel asked for is ready. Good. The problem is, how to send it to him. We are being watched. Ruarte is keeping us under control. That good man must eat or he'll come out of his hideout, and you can imagine the consequences. - I'll go! Are you crazy? They'd catch you right away and Don Ruarte could accuse us. Good-day to everyone. How are you, Uncle? And you, my lovely dear cousin? You are sad. Can I do something for you, for them, for him? Do what? You're incapable of anything. Test me. Give me an assignment, a problem, a quiz! - Alright. I'll take you up on that. Father! - I'll assign something important. - Thank you, Uncle. Take this basket. There are meatballs, bread and wine. I understood everything. - I am going on a picnic. - A picnic? - Take it to the old windmill. - The one with the ghosts? What ghosts? Take the basket to friar Miguel. - He lives with ghosts? - No, alone. - Why is he there? - He is waiting to eat! - He's been fasting for 3 days! - Poor thing. He'll die of hunger and become a ghost. See that there are ghosts? - What ghosts? Enough! - Shall I go? Excuse me, Uncle. A pinch to you and a kiss to me. You'll see. I'll please you. My little cousin. Isn't it a mistake to have sent him? I don't think so. It was an excellent idea. Who would take him into consideration? Who could suspect such a clown? Mr. Paco! - Good morning. - Come drink a glass with us. - Sergeant Garcia! - Have Mr. Paco sit down Very kind of you. Thank you. - Any news on Zorro? - No, not yet. - Soon we'll lend him to you. - I'm going. - No. Have something with us. - I can't. I have to run an errand. What lovely meatballs! May I taste them? They're my favorite. They must be delicious. If you eat them all, what'll I take to friar Miguel? He hasn't eaten for 3 days. He's waiting for me. If they're for friar Miguel, I won't touch them. Get your hands off! Always ready with those hands! You don't want friar Miguel to starve to death, do you? No. Of course not. May God bless you. Peace and good will. Goodbye. A cave. How lovely! Where can he be? Blessed friar! Friar Miguel! Friar Miguel, it's me. Friar Miguel! - I'm here. What is it? - Oh, God! You scared me! I brought you a simple, delicious Franciscan meal. I would even eat Saint Francis' wolf! - They're meatballs. - Delicious! - Even a floral homage. - How nice! Let's go over there. Are you sure nobody followed you? - Very sure. - Good-day! You are surrounded! - So many guards! - My compliments. You brought them. What is your name? You're a piece of shit, Paco. Let's see what these sons of... mothers want. Mr. Garcia. Get him! What are you doing? Stop! Don't fight! - Watch out! How violent! - You brought them all. Great! What are you doing? Stealing my meal? - Sergeant, you're running away? - I'll be right back. - Hit each other, but slowly! - Don't let him run away! Easy! Go with God. - Enjoy your meal! - Oh, my gosh! Saint Rosalia and other saints that I don't remember! Catch him! Get him! Don't trample the meatballs. Watch out! Savages! Primitives! Enough! Stop it! Get up! Get up. Go to friar Miguel. - Come, sons. I'll bless you. - Go on! Sergeant Garcia, have them stop. Jerks! I'll show you! I will intervene... You're going to sleep? I'll take care of it! Piece of shit... Is everyone sleeping? Guards and friars? Guards and friars, wake up! Guards and friars, wake up! Treason! Sergeant Garcia, treason! - What happened? - They stole all the whips! Really? Because of technical problems, the sentence inflicted on friar Miguel has been changed. Instead of 12 whippings, he will receive 12 kicks in the ass! And I'll have the honor of kicking him first! Go on, get going! Hard ass... Go on, Pablo! - Go on. - Miracle! Miracle! He said to her, "Dreamer, you like horses". "You like to dream, imagine knights, leaders." "Well, you are wrong! A real man is tender, refined." "Cultured. He is real love." - What is it, Father? - Very serious news. Oh, my God! Who is dead? Ruarte's mother, that witch Felipa, is leaving for Cartagena. - She's going on vacation? - Vacation? She's leaving with a trunk full of gold and jewels, our gold. The gold of the people who the usurpers pillaged! It's the end! We must do something! I have an idea. What? - May I dare? - Dare! Why don't we advise Ruarte? What did I say? What can we do? We must stop the gold from leaving the city. If I had a different nephew, I'd know what to do, but with him... - If you were worth half of Zorro... - I'd be a half shit. Dear Mother, you are about to have a very ugly encounter. Goodbye, jewels! You'll never see them again. But the best part is that the people will accuse Zorro! Ruarte, you're a genius! He's coming. This way or that way? Idiots! Did you see? Let's take him there. Turn around. Turn this way! Let's go. Where is it? Go get the horse! The horse... Not me. Him! One, two, three! Come on! How magnificent! Now they're mine. Mine! Soon a carriage will arrive with lowered curtains. Zaira is inside. They want to take her away from you. Don't allow it! You are Zorro! It's Zorro! Go! The horse? Where is the horse? Darn it! Stop! Get off. Go! Go! How dare you, scoundrel! Sexual maniac! Pig! I am a proper woman! Stop, or I'll call the guards! Stop it, pig! They didn't even introduce us! Young man, I understand you, but it's not a good reason to... What a fire! What a man! Listen! - Are you going that way? - I don't give rides to strangers! Scoundrel! No, go away! Go away, please! Go away! No, leave me alone! Leave me, please! The flesh is weak. Don't tempt me. No, please. No! Let me go! Don't do that. Yes... No, please. No! Oh, God! What did I do? Young man, I was kidding! I didn't want to give in right away. Who knows what you'd thought of me! Mysterious horseman, kiss me. A little, please! My heart. Heart! Heart of my life! You sleep too, dear. Stop! Stop! Finally! Hurry. Zorro is here! Give me a horse. Come on, Garcia! Move. Let's not waste time! - The gentleman asks for a horse. - What are you doing, idiot? - The young man needs a horse. - Give me a horse! No! What are you doing? Don't let him get away! Beat him up! - Stop! I... - Now you can't get away! Zorro attacked Donna Felipa's carriage! Then... Stop, boys! - I'll make you pay for this! - You! Hurry! Let's reach him! Idiots! Who is the idiot that left this trunk in front of the door? Here. Our jewels! The jewels of the people. Good-day! Mon oncle... Cousin. So much gold! How lovely! What beautiful emeralds! Marvelous. - Can you give me a 6 month loan? - Put it down! You're vulgar when you want, and you do it well! That gold is mine too. When you die, I get a third. Be frank and say I bother you, and you'd like to have me banned. I assure you that I am tempted to do so. - I don't see the reason. - I do. Meaning? What will you do with all that gold? I have to think it over. Maybe this is the right chance to kick out the tyrant. - Yes, Father. We must be very cautious. Precise plans and the right people. - Now we can finance... - A nice trip to Europe. - The revolution! - No, I hate arms, violence! Don't count on my part. Give it to me and I'll go to Paris. - Women, champagne... Bahamas! - I know where you should go. Say it. Go ahead and say it. Zorro destroyed 15 years of honest work! Our savings, collected with a lot of love, were destroyed! That man must be a sexual maniac. He tried to rape me! - What times! - No, what a stomach! - How dare you? - Excuse me. What do you plan on doing with Zorro? You have any idea? - Yes, Mother. - Let's hear it. - First, increase the bounty. - Good. - Second, reinstate the police arrest. - Very good! Third, whoever helps Zorro will be punished with 100 vertical whippings. Horizontal ones too! If anyone can give us useful news on his capture, he will be thanked by me personally and have his throat slit! You never know who to trust. Right? - Is that all? - Does it seem like little? Very little! - I'll tell you what to do. - Yes. While that brute was trying to rape me... Excuse me. Is this the moment to evoke your sexual memories? This idiot is ruining the atmosphere. Silence, imbecile! - Yes. - I was saying... While he was raping me, he often said the name of Zaira. - That big pig! - Right! It was very bad taste! While he's kissing another woman, it's lack of respect! Doesn't the idea I gave you suggest anything? It seems that Zorro is in love... with Zaira, of course! We could use Zaira as bait. Mother, you're a genius. You are more brilliant than I am. - They say friar Miguel is here. - Yes, but he's busy. It's a matter of a few minutes? - I don't know. Enter, if you want. - Thank you. - Friar Miguel! - Who is it? - Friar Miguel... - Don Diego, what is it? - Is he sleeping? - No, he's... leaving. - My condolences. - A hat on the bed brings bad luck! Townspeople superstitions. Will it take long? I must talk to you about something urgent. Only He knows. We are close. What is it about? We must gather the bravest men for a secret sitting. We must have a revolution. If you have a revolution, who knows how long it'll take. Will I resist? We need a revolution. It's the future for everyone, including me. - Are you making fun of me? - No. Why? Is it time? - Yes, it is time. - Why? What time is it? Will he be able to keep this secret? Yes. He'll keep the secret to his tomb. Here he is. Give me a hand. Go away. - Did you call for me? - Yes. Thank you for coming. How could I refuse such a kind invitation? Is there something important or interesting? Sergeant Garcia always keeps his promises. Follow me. Please! Wait. Mr. Paco, voilà! - Zorro? My gosh! - Don't be afraid. He's tied. Right? Come on, Mr. Paco! - Do what you want. - Mr. Zorro, you are all mine! Just a moment. It's just a loan. Is that clear? - In what sense? - Just a loan. Alright. I'll only use him two hours, and then he'll be yours. - Can I do what I want? - Go ahead. - You'd like to react, scoundrel! - Don't be afraid. - Can he bite? - No. He has a muzzle. Then I'll bite him. Yes! - Easy! He's just a loan. - Take that! - He wanted to take my Zaira! - Do what you want with him! Take that, scoundrel! Go on! Go on! Look at your Zorro! The heartbroken widower! Disgusting crow! Go on, swine! Go on! Cousin Zaira, here is your Zorro! Kneel! Kneel! You are here too, mon oncle. I told you I would kick your Zorro's ass up to your window! I hope you'll realize I'm worth more than this masqueraded clown! There! Be quiet! Now let's see who hides behind this carnival mask. He doesn't want to be revealed! Oh, yes! You don't want it, scoundrel? Get up! Get up! Get up! - Coward! - Look, cousin! - What? The town idiot? - Me? Who? Clown! Zorro will take revenge on this big act! I beg you. Tell him to forgive me! Please! Uncle! Cousin! Excellency, Mr. Paco Franquines is here. Who? Oh, that nuisance! No. I don't want to receive him. Have them hang him. You will receive him. The desires of my mother are my orders. - Go, and let him in. - Yes, excellency. Come in. Governor... Madame! - I came to protest. - I should have had him hung. - Hung? - You'll let him protest. - Thank you. - You can protest. Alright. Mr. Garcia... Yes, I heard. I had the whole town laugh. I'll promote him to lieutenant! He played a great trick on you. A dirty trick! Now Zorro is upset with me. If he finds me, he'll kill me. I realize it's very irritating, but what can I do? - Protect me! - Don't exaggerate. Calm down. Sit down and relax. How can I be calm? I am being spied, followed, controlled, intercepted. I am afraid of my own shadow! I was to participate in a secret reunion these days and I can't go! - A secret reunion? Interesting! Very interesting! Mon oncle organized it. Who? Mon oncle, it's French. My uncle! He has decided to do a revolution. - A revolution? - A revolution? - Why can't you go? - It's simple. That bandit Zorro always knows everything. He could show up. He'll find me and... What? Excuse my vulgarity, madam. If I understood correctly, Mr. Paco, you came here to ask for my protection? - Finally you understood! - Alright. The only way to protect you... I want to protect you. - Thank you. May I kiss you? - Not in front of Mother. The only way to please you is to capture Zorro. - Zorro? I know that too. - Then let's do this. You stay home and relax. And who will go to the reunion? - You'll go. - I'll go. - You'd do that for me? A governor is at the service of every citizen! How can they say you are evil? Ugly gossip. By the way... Where will this reunion take place? Thank you for coming. Did you talk to anyone? - Only my wife. - It's a secret. Watch out with those horns! Go on. I am glad that almost all of you are here. The long awaited moment has come! Zorro will return soon. Don't worry. The usurper will pay, and peace and justice will reign again. Good. You came too. Did you tell anyone? - No, not even my mother. - I didn't even tell my grandfather. Cover up. Spread out and take position immediately. - Here is the governor! - Cheers for the governor! Cheers for Don Diego! Cheers for Don Diego! Help me unload it. Put it there. It's the "Z" of Zorro! Citizens of New Aragon, the hour of the revolt has come, and the hours of usurper Ruarte are numbered! Bravo! Calm down. Hold back your enthusiasm for this historic event! The time has come to say stop to arrogance. Stop tyranny, stop to high prices! To arms! Let's get our payback and fight against the usurper! - Very good! - What is it, citizen? What arms, governor? We only have clubs and pitchforks. I have the honor and pleasure of communicating that our hero, the invincible Zorro, took from usurper Ruarte the treasure that he had stolen from the people, and put it at the disposal of our cause! Cheers for Zorro! Enough! The clown act is over! Get them! - Yes, sir! Get them! - Citizens, beat them! Don't be intimidated! Show that for a just cause, the force of muscles is worth more than arms! Luckily, we brought Zorro. This time it's over, Governor! Come away, Don Diego! Nothing more can be done. Zorro, get ready, it will soon be your turn. Get that rebel! Stop! Look here. Look here. Garcia, fatso, clown and spy! Fight like a man. Don't run away. Where are the others? You're afraid, huh? Olé! Once again! Olé! Enough, Zorro! I'll stab you! If you don't hold still, how can I? Have a good trip. Thank you, Zorro, my love! Hurry. Close it! Cover him well! The feet! Hurry! Come! Get down! My father...You always sleep while Zorro risks his life! Hurry. Close it. Hurry! Undress him. Here. Down. Out. Out! - Rocks? - Rocks! - I'll stay with the rocks. - I feel sick! Idiot. The tricked you! Come here! Come here! No, please! I've nothing to do with it! - You let Don Diego get away! - He has nothing to do with it! - What? You defend him now? - I saw him! He was about to open the trunk not knowing the stones were there. He was tricked as I was! He's innocent! So who did it? Zorro! You understand? Zorro again! Damn him! Damn him! Damn him! What game is this Zorro playing? "Zorro Takes It All". I... I... I would pay a little visit to Don Diego's home. - Will you go? - Me? Not me. You, idiot! My poor heart, poor heart, that cries and suffers for love! Zaira's heart will arrive, and she will love you. What bullshit! - Cursed bird! - In what sense? - In this sense! - To your father! Are you surprised at seeing me? Nothing surprises me about you. Neither your ways or your brazenness. Always austere. What makes you so sure of yourself? Maybe the presence of this sort of half man? Who is this worm? Leave, or I'll massacre you! Go away, scoundrel! Bastard! Stop! Stop, you arrogant villain! How dare you hit a poor worm like that? If you do it again, I'll slap you! Me? - Yes, I'll slap you! - How? Like this? - Harder. - Harder? Like this and like this! Harder! If I were you, I would kick myself! I would do it, yes! I would do it! I would do it! Poor ass! Sergeant, search everything in the house as if you were looking for something in your pants. You don't think my father is hiding here, do you? Your father? No. I'll take care of him later. I'm looking for a trunk with jewels that mysteriously disappeared. What evil are you plotting? Everyone knows that the trunk with jewels is in your hands. Right! A trunk full of stones. Sergeant, we looked everywhere, even in the barns. We only found some undernourished chickens. What is there left to check? - If it doesn't rain, it'll be nice! - What's the weather to do with it? - There's Mr. Paco's room. - Let's go see! Look everywhere. Hurry! Just now you had to... I do it when it comes. You had to come now? - Duty is a duty! - A stimulus is a stimulus. Mr. Garcia, please go away. I can't do certain things in front of others. I don't need encouragement. If you want to look, go ahead. Please, come. Relax! We've finished and are leaving. Let's go, come on! A breath of fresh air... To the right! One, due. One, two! So you'll stop being obnoxious... maybe. Who put out the light? - Well? - Nothing. - Satisfied? - Go! Keep your eyes well opened. Yes, sir! Attention! March! As for the two of us, miss, I could ask where your father is hiding, but I won't. - It would be wasted breath. - Maybe. I want much more! I want you. For the last time, I ask you... Do you want to marry me? You want the jewels, then my father. You can't have either so you want me. I am telling you for the last time. No, never! It's what you say. I'll know how to convince you because I like you very much. - A kiss! - Let me go! - Just a kiss! - You're good with women, huh? Stop! Very good, usurper! What ugly underpants! Go! Go! Bow to the lady. Go! Go! Why did he leave? Women! Women, women, women! Please, don't do that! Cousin Zaira, don't be fooled for the second time. Paco only gets fooled once. This onion is good! - Good-day, Mr. Franquines! - Good-day, Mr. Garcia. What's inside that basket? Mr. Diego's food? No, I will eat this food. I am going to the country on a picnic. Something smells like onions! It is you? - I kiss your hands. - Goodbye! Come on! Let's go! If Zaira were here, I would love her even more. Is there someone following me? There's no one. I can rest assured. The countryside is beautiful with the red and blue flowers. If Zaira was here, I would love her more. The countryside is so beautiful with red and blue flowers. If Zaira was here, I would love her even more. I made it this time! The countryside is beautiful. Mon oncle! Friar Miguel! I am alone. Come out! I made it! - Did anyone follow you? - I said I made it! Come out! I am alone! Alone, understand? Come. I don't know why Zaira sent him. You're enjoying the cool air in this lovely home in the middle of the woods. Woods? There are no trees. What are you saying? Each time I turn around, I see many. - Come on, catch them! It's not fair! You're starting again? - Stop! - How dare you? Let me go, you brute! - Get away! - Darn friar! I'll fix you! Miracle! He broke the rock with his head! He doesn't want to be a sleepwalker and the ceremony is about to begin. How many sleeping drops did you give him? Ten? You gave him too much! Zorro, get up and walk! - Why this delay? - I don't know. I can't explain it. Having your mother wait... Understand? - Mother, keep calm. Please. - Keep calm? Don't ruin the most beautiful day of my life. Not for me. But... Nothing. He's sleeping. Finally. What a great nap! Oh, God, Zorro! Please, Mr. Zorro, don't hurt me. I have nothing to do with it. Petty people say those things. Help! Help! - But... What is it? - You are Zorro. It's you. You see? It's true! I am Zorro. You've always been Zorro. You didn't know because you're a sleepwalker. A sleepwalker? Then Zaira loves me! If she loves Zorro, she loves me. Zorro and I are the same person. Zaira loves me! She loves me! - Where is Zaira? Call Zaira. - Come. Friends, Ruarte is taking Zaira away from me. Only you can stop him. How? If I go to Ruarte, he'll have me hanged. - Do you love your cousin or not? - Yes, I do! - Then run. Save her! - I don't even know how to fence. You know how to do everything. You're Zorro! - I am Zorro? - Yes! Then I'll go and free Zaira, I'll marry her, and come back! I'm Zorro! Hurry. The sword, the hat, the cape, the mask! Very strange... We haven't seen Zorro yet. That demon is shrewd. He will show up. Let's go. Look! Zorro! Guards! Get him! Dead or alive! Don't get agitated, fatso. or your belly will sag. I'm coming! Catch me! - There he is! - 100 escudos to who captures him! - I said he would come. - I'm coming! - Bravo, Zorro! - My love! - Rip him in pieces! - Let me go. Bravo! Come on! You wrote the last letter! For you, my Zaira. And now, Ruarte, the two of us. Come. Say goodbye to you mother. Who are you? Who are you? Before fighting, I want to know who I'm fighting with! - Give him a sword! - Give it to him. Zorro, for the last time... Who are you? You will know in due time. En guarde! Come on. Let's not waste time. You're trembling. You're afraid! - A bread cake? - It's not the moment to eat! Nor the moment to rest! Again! Go! Here! Again? Where are you going? You're finished. It's not fair! I'm coming! Stop! - Does it hurt? - It hurts... - And now? - A little more... That's better. Stop! Stop! I've never met a fencer like you. Who are you? - You really want to know? - Yes! Watch this! Watch this! One... two... and three! You didn't recognize me? You don't know? I won't tell you. Scoundrel! Come back! Where are you going? I've tired you out, Ruarte. It's over for you! Get ready! I'm coming! Goodbye, Ruarte! Have a good trip! Enough... enough. You won. But tell me something... I want to know who defeated me. For the last time. Who are you? He wants to know who I am! I will please you. - Who are you? - Look. One... two and three! Yes. - I want to die! - Then die! See what a shitty impression? - Because I wasn't there! - Enough! - Hurrah! - Thank you! Cheers for the newlyweds! Thank you!
