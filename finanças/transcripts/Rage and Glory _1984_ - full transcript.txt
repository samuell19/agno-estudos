At this crucial time, when thousands of our brothers are being slaughtered in Europe, the British are shutting the gates of Palestine to Jewish refugees and sending ships of immigrants back out to sea. The "Hagana" and the "Irgun" have stopped activities against the conqueror, and we, alone, "The Freedom Fighters of Israel", continue the struggle to establish a haven for Jewish people the world over, in our homeland, Eretz Yisrael. - Jerusalem 14 March 1942- She really is very, very pretty. Good evening, Noah. Hello, Mr. Sasson. - Hello. Noah Kaplan. Do you remember him? He went to school with Angela. Son of which Kaplan? - The lawyer, who died two years ago. His offices were on Ben Yehuda Street. Are you joining the army, son? - Which army? - The British army. Mother, father? Have you met Noah? - Yes, we've been chatting a bit. Let's dance. - Who is that boy? What is he doing here? Where did Angela meet him? - I told you, at school. I haven't seen so many stuffed shirts since my school days. Hey, Kaplan, how are you? I see you're not really a soldier. Danzinger, did the Brits make a driver or a cook out of you? You were a weasel at school, Kaplan… - Danzinger… Enough, Noah. Would you speak like a civilized person and stop being so aggressive? I'm aggressive? - You purposely didn't dress nicely to come here, right? Let me get this straight. Suddenly you don't like my taste in clothes or are you just afraid your father may say something? Don't go badmouthing my father. - He is a capitalist parasite… …who sucks up to the British and… - I don't want to hear anymore. Let's dance. May I? Can I speak with you for a moment? I have to leave soon. Angela, I think about you all the time, really. Your first time? - Yes. They barely let me out of the house. Tell me, do you have the same problems? - I live on my own. You are making too much noise, Elnakam. - Sorry. I could go for fried eggs and sausages right now. Perhaps Nivale will prepare something for you. - Ask her. Nivale, are you cooking? - No. - Then it would be worthwhile before we get married, for you to take a quick course with Angel. What time is it, do you know? - I'm sorry I'm late. My motorcycle gave me a lot of trouble. Good luck. I didn't do anything. I promise. God! I promise you… Please, I promise you, I wasn't doing anything… Thank you. Excuse me, what time is it? - 12:30. - Thank you. Do you read Arabic? - No. Why do you have an Arabic paper if you can't read Arabic? I'm just looking at the pictures. - They didn't say a Hebrew paper? What are you… I don't remember. They told me to bring a newspaper. Wait a second, are you the guy I'm supposed to… - Yes, come on. Dafna, are you listening? - Yes. - Here's the rest of the transmission. The "Fighters for Freedom of Israel" do not believe that England's anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist approach to the revival of the Jewish people in the Land of Israel will change. A time for peace, a time for war. A time to build, a time for conquest. There is one force alone which will open the locked gates of the country, the force of a single bomb. - Give it to me. - Excellent. If the people in Tel Aviv think that before every operation they have to send us a supervisor, we'll see what will happen. I don't think they are any smarter than us in Tel Aviv. - Relax. I see no need for an assassination attempt. - What do you mean? He means that the principle is more important than our pride, Manik. You know the Butcher of Tel Aviv, don't you? - How is that related? See you, Dafna. - Goodbye, Manik. Give it to me, please. I want to go over it again. It is hard for him. - The issues of… - Have you nothing to say? He feels they are taking our chapter away from him. - Taking away? Why are you asking me? - Because somehow, you always know everything before everyone else and don't always let on. The issues of Zionism are very exhausting… Here we are. It's cold, isn't it? Actually, there is a stove, but no kerosene. "For Whom the Bell Tolls", Ernest Hemingway. Have you read it? - I don't read novels. - What do you read? Tell me, can I sleep here? - I don't know, they didn't say. If you want to, be my guest. It's fine with me. I only know that someone will come for you in the evening. I take it you are supposed to be retired, judging by your disguise? Do you mind if I lie down on the bed? - Go ahead, no worries. Do you want a blanket? - No thank you. Cigarette? - No thanks. - I hear there is trouble in Tel Aviv. The gentiles found a warehouse. Informers, right? Disgusting… There are many informers here too. People like that don't deserve to have their own state, seriously. Rumor has it the next target will be the Minister. Is that true? - Buddy… Sorry. There are many conspiracy theories. Forget what I said. Rest. Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. What time is it? - Ten to seven. They may only come for you tomorrow. Lately there have been many searches and ambushes. Did you hear about Shimon, the boy they murdered? He was my classmate. I was with him on the operation when he was caught. It probably wasn't an operation like you are used to… Do you have anything to eat here? - Yes, but there is only fruit. I eat at my mother's once a day. That is enough for me. Do you want to listen to music? - What do you have? - Jazz. All kinds: Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington. Something you use for shaving and for… I'm talking too much again, right? It's okay. He's one of ours. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Can I see the gun? I'm leaving the suitcase here. Don't open it. Of course not. You needn't have said anything. Take a key. I'm going out at night. Okay? - Why are you asking me? I don't know, I thought maybe you'd like me to help. Don't you miss boxing? - I do. I miss many things. But when at war, you don't think about things like that. You know the Butcher of Tel Aviv, don't you? - A little, yes. What is he like? I've heard there is something wrong with him. He knows no fear. - Everyone is afraid, Pinocchio, it's natural. So they say. But there are freaks of nature, mutations. Like two-headed snakes. - Do you want some jam? Yes, thank you, Niva. Hello, I am head of the chapter. - Pleased to meet you, I'm Eddy. How are you, Pinocchio? - Fine. I haven't seen you in a long time. Are you still in Section Six? Operations. - Any searches along the way? - Nothing. Did they send a budget with you? - They didn't send anything. Hell, we're all dried out. We haven't got a penny to our name. We've started stealing food. - I have no idea. I met Itzik yesterday. He said nothing to me. I have my allotment if that will… - No thanks. We'll manage. Shall we start? Show me the sketch, Pinocchio. He comes from here… It is pure madness. Here they are, these are the two. Did you explain things to them? In general, not the particulars. You have a motorcycle, right? - Yes. - Do you know Jerusalem well? Me? Every path, every stone. Everything. - Excellent. I asked you to whistle first. - Sorry, I forgot. But I brought some food from my mother's. - Thank you. You know that I'm the guy with the motorcycle tomorrow? Use mud. - What? - Use mud to cover the license number. You're going out? - Yes, but not for long. Where to? - I'm meeting a girlfriend. Is there a problem? - Who is the girl? - Angela Sasson. She was two years below me in school. Morris Sasson's daughter. Do you know him? - No. - Very rich. A speculator. But she's all right. Do you have a problem with my going? May I? Do you have a girlfriend? - No. - You hang out with different girls? I don't date and I don't hang out. - What do you mean? Wait a minute, if you don't know anyone in Jerusalem, I went to school at the Academy… - No thanks. It doesn't go together. What doesn't go together? - Love, war, they don't mix. Good evening. - To you too. - You are the "Butcher"? Finally. Is this all right? - Fine. You stole it? - Yes, of course. Nice toys, aren't they? Hello. - Hello. So, are you nervous? - Yes, and you? - Me? No way. Excuse me, are you free? - Where to? - Hadassa? - Hadassa, Hadassa. Are you from Tel Aviv? - From Yavniel. - Yavniel? What brings you to the Holy City from Yavniel? What do you want? Act naturally and nothing will happen to you. Get out and go with him. - Please don't ruin my taxi. We won't ruin anything. You will get your taxi back. Everything will be fine, God willing. I missed you, you know? Look over here for a second. Now do you understand? I always knew you were a quick study. That's it. It begins. Is everything all right? - We'll soon see. Something is wrong. It's not going off. What a disgrace! - Alex, where are you going? Alex! Alex! Run! Can't you go any faster? - Don't you think I would if I could? I'll take him upstairs. You wait here with the taxi. - Okay. Hello. - Hello. - How are you? I'm going to boil some water. - And bring me an old sheet. If we had done it my way and not like your friend said it would have been simple and this wouldn't have happened. - Sh… Are they all right? - I think so. - Do you know them? Are you going for a doctor? - I can't. It's too dangerous now. I have to return the taxi… All right, I'm going out. I'm going, be careful. The English are all over. You can't leave for Tel Aviv tomorrow. They will probably have roadblocks at all the city exits. You know what I think? When we ran away, someone recognized me. Who? - Someone named Danzinger. - Does he know where you live? Maybe. He might just know where my mother lives. I haven't lived here very long. What do we do? - Wait until morning. But they will search then too. - Take this. - What is it? - Put it on. I don't speak Arabic. - Do you know how to use? - How to use what? Sort of. Once, my father showed me how to use a revolver. What make is this? - A Webley. Jump out the window if someone knocks. Clear? Is that clear? - Yes. Seven twenty eight. I'm worried about Alex. - Yes. - Someone else has you worried, no? I'm worried about the broadcast, Manik. Excuse me… This is the "Voice of Fighting Zion", "The Voice of Free Zion". Non-stop military activities continue against the foreign rule. Since our last broadcast, there has been another raid by the Fighters for Freedom of Israel. On the 16th of Adar, the British Secret Police Centre in Jerusalem was attacked in retribution for the heinous murder of the boy, Shimon Bobovitz. Stormtroopers of the occupying force, Jewish blood will be avenged! Shimon's murder was avenged by the death of four enemy soldiers. Today's raid took the lives of two British officers and two soldiers. The liberation of our homeland depends on our fight for freedom. If the cries of our dying brethren, exterminated in the holocaust, have not yet been heard by the democratic ministries… It hurts him, when he sleeps. Where will you sleep, Pinocchio? Here, on the chair. You can sleep with me, if you want to. Just let it be clear that nothing is going… - I didn't think otherwise. Though there is nothing to be ashamed of. Good night. Who is it? - I don't know. Who's there? - I don't know. Let's get him out of here. Give me your gun. - I don't have one. Run. Run. How many do you have left? - One. Shoot and run. Shoot and run! Who's there? Who is it? Who's there? - It's me, Pinocchio. I don't have an envelope. I'm sorry. They caught us and I… Come, sit down. Would you like a hot drink? - Water. Water. May I take my shoes off - Of course. They got Alex. Somebody snitched. Maybe someone on the inside. Please. Can I see your foot? - Do you know anything about these things? I studied nursing for a while. But I stopped. I put up water. It will soon boil. - For a minute there, in the flat, I thought I was a goner. I was really sure. You're from Poland, aren't you? - I'm from Crakow. What street? - You know Cracow? I saw you there when I came for a sporting event. Yael, open up. It's Niva. Where is Alex? Did they kill him? Did they catch him? Tell me! Listen, that noise is driving me crazy. - Enough already! Shlomi, if you have nothing to say… What do you want me to say? Some Biblical babble, two bodies, a failed raid, and no one has anything to say. No criticism for the Tel Aviv gentleman. What about you, Missy? The first time something goes wrong and we don't get a two hour lecture from you. Manik, we all know what happened. - What happened? These things happen but we must carry on. We are the catalyzer, we are making history. Shlomi, it took two years to develop this chapter, farms, youth groups, organization, and now we're throwing it all away… Do you think this chapter was established… Hello. The boarding house was burned down, somebody recognized Noah. So what do you plan to do now? - I plan to try again. What will we try with this time? - With what we have. And what we don't have, we'll buy or steal. - Eddy, we're all in danger. And we always will be. Why the argument? - We're not arguing, Eddy. We just want to hear what the old man has to say before we try again. The instructions were clear, kill the British before he wipes us all out. Eddy, let's put our cards on the table. The raid failed. Alex is in prison. The prosecutor is seeking the death penalty. Do you get it? What's your point? Are you afraid? - Afraid? No way! No one is afraid, Eddy. We just want to speak to the old man. Maybe… If I may be so… - You go. Ask him, and come back. We'll wait. - All right. We'll wait. Dafna, come here, please. Where will we sleep? - You will sleep here. I'll bring you blankets for the night. I want one thing to be clear: He stays here as a retiree. I don't want any information to reach him. Britain, granted the right to rule here by the League of Nations, and to establish a Jewish state, is in breach of trust. Were the League of Nations truly a just organization, You would be sitting here, the accused. Britain has betrayed us, and in light of this betrayal we are forced to go to war against the British empire. By what moral right do you accuse me of murder? You do not look upon a British soldier who kills a German soldier as a murderer. Or perhaps you do consider your soldiers to be criminals? What would you do if your families were being murdered in Poland and in Germany and the rule of rage barred their final escape route? I accuse Britain of conspiring in the death of my people in Europe. For you, Angela. - Who is it from? Where are you going? - To the locker room, for a minute. Eliyahu, I am going on my own. - It's not… - It is. Father specifically forbade that. - I know what father said. Noah, are you here? Angela? - Noah… I was so worried about you. The police came to our house. They asked all sorts of questions about you. They know where you live. They are searching for you all over. - The police know nothing. Look, here I am. Where are they? I love you. - And I love you. I want us to get married. - What? - I want to be your wife. Hello, I'm looking for work. Is there any work? I want work. How are things going? - Things are getting interesting. So, will I be participating? - We'll see… Eddy, how long have you known Dafna? Dafna? Two, two and a half years. We met once at a work camp on a kibbutz. So? - So what? - Did anything happen? - Noah… Want to hear something? - What? - Angela wants to marry me. Congratulations. - What do you think? - What do I think? You're the groom! I'm not the groom yet. It's such a mess… - Why a mess? Do you love her? - Of course I love her. But to marry her… If you love her and she loves you get married. - What "get married"? What of your love and your war? - I am who I am, and you are you. A wonderful distinction. Should I take offence? - No. How did it go? - How are you, Eddy? - Good, we met by chance in the yard. Do we have the approval to steal? - Yes, we have the go ahead. But both of you must approve the plan. - Great! - Did you get it? Where is Dafna? - She's on guard. Who is that for? - I don't know. I'm just knitting. If you like, I can knit for you, too. Thank you, but it would be a waste to give it to me. The sweater would just end up full of holes. I can mend it. - The sweater, yes. But you can't mend me. - Pinocchio… Where did you learn how to do all that? In the Irgun, before we broke away. One time, one blew up in my face, and I've been ugly ever since then. - You're not ugly. So, what do you think, Pinocchio? Don't I look totally British? It looks very good. What say you? A bit short, don't you think? Is that fresh bread I smell? Oh God, I forgot. I'm baking. - Baking? Hello. Hello. - All right. - You won't believe it, Pinocchio. The saleslady really thought Niva and I were husband and wife. Niva, maybe we'll get married? - Maybe not? - Why not? Nivale, do you know this trick? Eli, stop. - Don't you think a girl her age should finally know what this is? - What is that for? It's so there won't be any… - You use it when you want to prevent the nitroglycerin from leaking out of the dynamite. Sometimes the dynamite sweats and so there must be no dripping. One should never have drippings. - You're disgusting. What did I say to her? George, Mr. Sasson will be late. We will eat a little later. As you wish. - Thank you. Angela? - Yes? - May I? - Come in, Mother. Very nice. - Do you think so? It's not a bit old-fashioned? - No. It's not small on you? - No, not yet. Where are you going? - There's a class party. Where? - At David Abulafia's. Remember him? I went with him to the King David last year. - Oh, to that ball. His mother had that feathered hat… - Sat down on it. Want to see something strange I saw on the Post Office billboard? You're not seeing him anymore, are you, Angela? - Mother… When I was your age I met a boy the police were looking for. He was handsome… - No need to worry, Noah isn't handsome. And Eliyahu's British friend, Jeremy, do you find him handsome? I don't know, was father handsome? - Your father? Handsome? I don't know. Impressive, manly… - Like Humphrey Bogart. I don't know. Hello. - Where are you going, looking so pretty? She has a party, a class party. I don't see anyone picking her up. - I arranged to meet a girlfriend. Eliyahu, take the keys to the auto and accompany your sister. Father, there really is no need. Really. - Are you sure? - Yes, really. All right. - Good night. - Good night. Angela… - Yes? - You'll be home by ten? - I promise. We're here. Blessed are You O Lord, King of the Universe, Who creates the fruit of the vine. - Amen. Blessed are You, o Lord, King of the Universe Who has sanctified us with your commandments and prohibited illicit relations: You have forbidden the cohabitation of those who are merely betrothed, permitting it to those who are married through consecrated wedlock. Blessed are You o Lord, who sanctifies Your people by consecrated wedlock. - Amen. Lift the bride's veil. Let her drink, please. Please give me the ring you brought. - In my bag. Repeat after me, and then place the ring on her finger, the middle finger on her left hand. You are hereby. - You are hereby. - Look at her. - You are. You are. - You are. - Wedded to me. - Wedded to me. - With this ring. - With this ring. In accordance with the law of Moses and Israel. In accordance with the law of Moses and Israel. Yes, put it on… - Congratulations! - Wait, wait, wait… The Court finds the… How do I look? - Fine. - It doesn't look a little silly? I don't understand how women can go around like this. You look good. - Thank you. Give me my wallet, please. - Here. - Thank you. Can I ask you something? - I don't think it's worth it. Look at me. - What do you want, Dafna? I want you to look at me. Don't you think you have something to say to me? - No. You have nothing to say to me? - No. What kind of person are you, Eddy? Don't you care about anyone? Dafna, I'm sorry I hurt you. - Don't be sorry. I'm not hurt so easily. Good morning. Okay Major, you've done your duty. Don't be silly, Alex. - Life continues when death serves a purpose. Do you know who said that? - No. - Me neither. Can I have a cup of coffee? This is suicide, Alex, and it goes against your religion. "As long as deep in the heart "The soul of a Jew yearns, "And forward to the East "To Zion, an eye looks…" Is it possible without that? Long live the Jewish State! Hear o Israel, the Lord is our God. The Lord is One." An eye for an eye! Check. Check. Angela, who taught you to play like that? Mother, come watch me beat Eliyahu. It suits you. You should tie your hair back more often. Do you have a dance lesson? - In another hour. I'm not sure the teacher will come. There are many roadblocks. It took me two hours to get here, today. Where is father? - At the factory. Did you talk to him yesterday? Yes, we spoke last night. - Did something happen? Father will surely talk to you this evening. - Check. What about? Going to America. Who is going? - All of us, the whole family. Father sold the factory, he signs the papers tomorrow. I'm not going to America. - Don't you want to meet Humphrey Bogart? I'm serious. I'm not going to America. Eliyahu, will you excuse us for a few minutes? - Yes, certainly. I can't, Mother. I can't go to America. Angela, it is not open for discussion. It is dangerous. We must go, don't you understand? We are just going to get up and go. That's it, we have no choice. It's difficult to leave books, no? - Books are like people. Where do you want me to write? - On the wall next to the door. Thank you. - You are welcome. Are you coming? - Yes. Be careful on the way out. Don't touch the door. - Okay. See you. - Goodbye. I just wanted to check if it is safe. - Only death is safe. Have you read Nietzsche? - Nietzsche who? Nietzsche, that German philosopher who wrote "Thus Spoke Zarathustra…" Eddy, may I ask you something? It may not be too prudent. Go upstairs. - It's really very important. Please don't say no. What's wrong? - Remember I arranged to meet Angela every Monday and Thursday at Herod's Tomb? Well, twice already, she hasn't come. I must see her. So what do you think I should do? What do you say? Noah, are you coming? Noah? Don't do anything stupid. "Niva, I love your two eyes…" Let's not open the door, Pinocchio, you're not well. Pinocchio, we'll run away. They won't find us. How are you, Pinocchio? We were worried about you. I can't anymore… What? I don't understand. - Niva, you know me, I'm not a coward. There is an informer. Someone is passing on information. There is no informer, Pinocchio. We need you. If you are ill, that's something… - I'm not ill. I just can't anymore. There is no point, everything we do, somebody… Pinocchio, you are betraying your friends and your ideals. We are at a turning point… - You can manage without me, too. You know you will be tried? Only death may release you, remember? Do what you will. A bullet to my head will do me good. It will put an end to my nightmares. - Why are you pushing him? Leave him alone. - Yael, not another word. - I won't let you. This won't just blow over. Excuse me, who are you looking for? - Angela Sasson. And who are you, please? - Steven Schweig. Wait here. I'll call her. Hello. Why have you come? You don't know… Where have you disappeared? I haven't disappeared. I am not allowed to see you anymore. My parents know about us. If they see you here, they will call the police, right away. - Where is everyone going? Running from me or from Rommel? - We are going to America. Who is "we"? You, too? - Yes. - You can't go. You are my wife… - Enough. I have no choice, Noah. What do you mean "have no choice"? Don't you love me? I love you. I have no choice. Let's meet in an hour, at Herod's Tomb. You won't come. - Yes I will. Just go away, please. Angela? - Yes. - Did you finish packing the books? Yes, only the… statue, can you help me? - Who is that? Someone who came to say goodbye. - Do I know him? - I don't think so. Noah, come with me. - I can't come with you. Yes you can. I can help you if money is a problem. It's not a question of money at all. I just… If the problem is a passport, I can help with that too. Noah, please, come with me. Angela, I don't want to hear anymore of this, all right? Enough. Manik, we must kill him. Hold a trial by members and put a bullet to his head. Do you hear? I hear but we don't kill our own so quickly, Elnakam. It's not a question of friends, Manik. He is endangering us all. He is a traitor. - Careful what you say, Elnakam. Are you afraid, Manik? - Of what? Pinocchio is only human. We don't have to kill him just because he's had a breakdown. There is no room for sentimentalism. I demand a trial by members, Manik. First of all, let's all calm down… - Pinocchio spoke of an informer. I don't believe there is an informer here, but tomorrow there is a raid, and we can't take risks… - So what are you trying to say? That I want a trial by members. - We have no time for that now. Then we must bring him here. What will they do to Pinocchio? - Go with her, Noah. - What? If you want her, go with her. But I want to participate in the raid tomorrow. I said I… - No. And what about "only death may release you"? It's a song. - What "song"? If it's only a song, why are you here? I am here because I want to be here. Is it only a question of will? Not of historic necessity? Of the reality we find ourselves… - Noah, stop with the philosophy. Do what you want. Good morning. - Good morning. - I bought you some food and paints, like you asked. - Thank you. - So sit and eat your breakfast, and then paint as long as you like. - You're not a person at all, you're a little angel. Sit down and paint, you promised me a painting. It must be the neighbor. It's not worth it, Pinocchio. Get away from here, I'm begging you. Pinocchio, we were worried about you. There is work to be done. Why won't you leave him in peace? We need crackers for bombs for tonight. We will go tomorrow. You can stay at home. Just prepare them. Eddy, you're killing him. His life will be on your conscience. Pinocchio, what about the informer? - There is no informer among us. Do you have materials? - We have what we have. Pinocchio, I'm begging you, don't do it. Don't do it… Cut it carefully… - I know. How do you like married life? It's okay, I guess… - Take it. How is the forgery? - It looks real, doesn't it? - Nice. I eat when I'm scared. It calms me down. - Ready? - Ready. Pinocchio, to your left. Now! Eddy! Niva! Go! Go! Run… Go on, run. Run… "Rage and Glory"
