Isn't it? Jang-woo! I brought you lunch! Why is she here? He's overprotective. We got a princess in the making. A little burned? Not cooked enough? So long as it tastes good, right? Enjoying your lunch in peace? Shove it down and get the rest done! Look at them shoving shit down. My brother must be doing all the work here. If it weren't for them, this'd be heaven. My head! She's causing high blood pressure. Blood pressure is supposed to go up! That brat and her mouth! Holding out on redevelopment won't work. Sign the consent form. Finished already? Eun-ji, baby. Are you going to school or to a bar? Why's your skirt so short? I can see your asshole, you brat! I can take all your shit, but not about my sis! Here. Who wears pants under the skirt? No way. So freezing... Mom! Dad! - Your daughter is indecent! - Okay, fine! Fine! I'll put it on! Pain in the ass. Major one! Ow! Hold on tight. It hurts! Redevelopment is the only way Timing is key, half beat faster. Half beat? This one works well. You're right. It swallowed $3 yesterday. Should I reimburse you? No, that's okay. It's working now. Mr. Suh, the claw machine does the best business here. A freebie to our best client. It's all right, I got a ton at home. Me too, I got a ton. See? Here. From my heart. Thank you. Han Eun-ji? Where is she? Eun-ji? Anyone here? Where did my sister go? Why does my brother long for me? Did something happen? She asked me to fetch that for her. Pay it for me. Let's go. Go easy on him, he's our VIP client. We make a mint here. How much? You had to come here when my hubby left for the sea? Forget it, I'm not selling. You're bad luck. My day's ruined. Isn't she the one who sees ghosts? Really? Lets hurry. My back! - Where you at? - Not again! Come straight home after class. Know what day it is? Come on! Must we do it every year? I don't even remember them. Stop it, what's my motto? Work for you, books for me. Good, I'm out. Was that Eun-ji? When is she coming? Mind your business. Myung-gyu, what's my motto? Um, we're family! One and only! You're my mother's sister's... Your mother's sister's, new husband's stepson. Super distant. In any case, we're still family, okay? Line can't be crossed. Not at all! Very dangerous! So you know, then why did you call and text her yesterday? How did you know! Run! So it's true? I told you not to! Our Father in heaven, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as in heaven. Hey. You Okay? Lee Si-eun. The ghost whisperer, right? Is the rumor true? That you see the future. If it's so painful, just accept it and become a shaman. Like that other shaman. What about my future? What'll happen to me? You know, how I'll live, whom I'll live with. I got a big brother, who will he marry? IF he can get married. I don't see that. Only how one dies. Still want to know? How you'll die? Even if you knew, you'll still die. Wanna hear it? That's scary. Why do you talk like that? Can't you just ignore it? If they'll die anyway, it's not your fault. Why don't you come with me? Come here. There's a hair shop in town. Come see me there. I'll wait for you. My brother will come for me. You only left me with this house and Eun-ji. I'll protect both. Mom, dad! I'll raise her properly. Don't you worry. Where the heck is that brat? Have a good night, and come back soon. Sir, I'm opening my own shop next year. Please come see me there. I'll take good care of you. Jang-woo. What! Once I get my license, I'll make a lot of money. I'll take care of the money! So what? Once I get to college, what about tuition? Do you know how much that costs? Who asked you to worry about that? - I'll take care of it! - $5,000 per semester! That's nothing! I can ask my school seniors. You didn't even graduate. They're useless. I really don't need college. I'll save up, open my shop and live happily with you here. You'll live like me? In a hick town, wreaking of bleach, barely making ends meet, forever like that? Don't you dare go outside, just study. I'll go outside! I will! Bro! What are you doing? You're locking me inside? Open this door! Open! Is he nuts? We gotta support government's work. You're the only hold out, take the money and sign. Look at next town over, people are flocking to it. What if they send gangsters to harass your sister? Mr. Kim. Go all in. Fine, fine. What'll you wager? You're almost empty. I got rent to collect, I'm out. Ill... wager this. Redevelopment Consent Form Redevelopment Consent Form Would you look at that. Would you look at that. You even signed it, but decided to cause him grief? Bet everything you got. Your factory, SHOP. And your kid too. Don't you dare. Fine, I'll bite. But if I win, I'm taking everything. Show me. Have a great life! My sister and I will live happily ever after in Seoul. Fuck... Jang-woo? Bro! Jang-woo! Help! Help! Go home, isn't this for your sis? Why you so drunk? My brother can... find me wherever I am. Even in the middle of the ocean. My brother will come for me. How's the claw machine business? Can you save up enough to get married with those? All right, here and here. I heard you fought with her. Thought she wouldn't bypass a locked door? Understand? She took off after fighting with you. Just wait 3 days. She gets hungry and cold, she'll come right back. You... Eun-ji... Eun-ji Where's Jang-woo? I don't see him. He's probably not himself, he practically killed her. How could he lock her in? What'll happen to our poor Jang-woo? Despite his stubbornness, he loved her so much. But she had it coming. With red lipstick and smile, she was a jail bait. I knew something was coming. Look, that must be 'the soul scoop'. What is it? They float it with rice inside, ghosts eat the rice, and leave the dead's nails and hair. Stop it. What do you want? Look at that blood! She's gonna die! Get down here! Where's the brass bowl? Hey. Hey, stop! Anything in particular? Is this a bestseller? Super Comet? We all got a pair during last year's election campaign. What's your size? You're bad luck! - What's with her? - You vile thing! You met Eun-ji, didn't you? Tell me how you came to my place. You must've known something! - How did she... - I saw her. Saw what? What did you see? So the rumor's real. 'Cursed bitch'. Let go! I simply followed my vision there. I hate this more than anything. Things that I see. Why does that matter now? She's dead. Jang-woo, I'm told we got the killer. Wanna go meet him? He sent 1,000 paper cranes and over a dozen presents. 1,000... He must've imagined it more than 1,000 times. - And on that day, he called her twice. - It wasn't me! It'll be over soon. Jang-woo! Also, the victim's underwear were recovered at his place. Eun-ji's panties and bras. That's smoking gun. Jang-woo... So the brass bowl was floating, and there were waves. And it stopped in front of... - Super... - Super Comet! And Eun-ji's soul is telling us who killed her? Yes. What a load of bullshit. Don't say those things, you'll be sent to the asylum. Mister. We should be using forensics to investigate, right? - What? - Huh? Shamanism has no place in modern investigation. He's not the killer! He's a relative, he's family! More reason to! About 40% of all rape cases are carried out by family members, and relatives. And her undies were recovered at his place! But he always stole those since a long time ago! Right! Right! I don't think rape was involved. Come on, she was found disrobed! And all disrobed cases are rape? I think it was just murder, there's no trace of rape. Why else would she be practically naked? Whatever... I couldn't care less about brass bowl and Super Comet. The evidence is clear. Once you come clean, this case is all but over. They're so full of crap. Order my lunch, don't think. Li! Sis Hello? Who is this? Why do you have Eun-ji's phone? How many times have I told you? Sir, even the police require a warrant for GPS tracking. Please come back with the phone owner. It doesn't have an owner. Did he go abroad or something? She's dead. She's gone. Are you happy now? Oh, she's dead... You should've said so earlier. We need a death certificate, national ID, and proof of identity. There's a protocol for this, one moment, sir. Sir! Wait! Look, it's that girl. Hey, I heard you're like a psychic. Can you see if we'd be a good couple? Go on. Fucking shaman bitch, listen when someone talks. - What's that? - What is it? Get with the program. Bible? - You could go to hell for that. - Shut your hole. Am I right? Who the hell are you? Why bother a harmless person? Come here. What the fuck, man. Are you her brother or something? Me? Yeah, you. I'm a fucking bystander. - Come with me. - What the shit? Hey! Bastard. What's your name? Si-eun. Lee Si-eun. Si-eun, you need to do me a favor. That's so messed up. Why say that she's dead when she's alive? This is my house, and most of these are empty. So he called from nearby? It's the last known position. What happened? Isn't it obvious? I got it, of course. So she caved in after making such a fuss. You deserve an award. And the pharmacist? I'm working on it. Li! Sis Jang-woo? When did you get out? A moment ago... Not enough evidence... Did you see a runner just now? That... way. Saw his face? Um, no, I didn't. You know I didn't kill her, right? I know, I know. Jang-woo! What'd you like? One energy drink, please. Sure. Here you go. How are you holding up? I know how devastating it is when your loved one is gone. Sorry, shouldn't have said that. Give me a minute. I wish I can do something for you. My shop may be small, but it's got everything. Fishing bait, canned food... Take it, I insist. And find the killer, he deserves to be punished. - Welcome. - So cold... What can I get you? My soles are hot nowadays. Menopause, maybe? No way, not a chance. I'm still young. It's because I got no man. - Give me some cold meds. - Someone sick? The bane of my existence. Studying makes him sick, apparently. Give me night time meds. Here you go. Oops, clumsy me. How much? $7, please. Take care. This is what I made today. Okay. - 97, 98... - 97, 98... 99... What in the world? You scared me. 87... 88... 89... 94, 95, 96... 97, 98, 99... Si-eun? My wife's there! What are you doing? Get over here! Rookie, come here. Stay here for a minute. I knew she was trouble the moment she came to town. - Get over here! - Bring one more unit! Goddammit. It's really him. Shut the hell up! Don't you want to kill anyone who feels fishy? Jang-woo, of all people out there, why the pharmacist? He's practically a saint. I found Super Comet there! I'm more suspicious of you. Her body was found at your place, and you're at murder scenes before us. So, tell me. I said Si-eun told me about it. This is nuts. Brass bowl, and now a shaman. What? Stop this witch hunt, and go wait over there. What a load of shit. How long should I wait? Remember what you said before? You said to wait just 3 days. And then what happened? After those 3 days, she came back as a body! Beaten up to a pulp, bloody and bruised all over, torn apart like paper... Same as Eun-ji, but it's not the same killer? We'll investigate thoroughly. Catch him! Son of a bitch... Catch him and bring him to me! Go catch him! You asshole! Bring him to me! Don't ever come back here! What a bad luck! I wanted to... spread her ashes near my parents. It's too cold, so I'll do it in the spring. That's what remains of her. I'm sorry. That day... I thought it could be her. She treated me like a friend. But I didn't do anything. And she died like that. Eun-ji and that woman... Everyone dies around me. Why's that your fault? It's my fault... for leaving her alone. Si-eun, give me your phone. Hand it over. When your ghosts come calling, call me and tell me everything. I'll be there before him to catch the bastard. Come here! I got sweets! Gather around! - Who wants one? - Me! - Take one each. - Thank you! Go play over there. Masan Nursing Hospital Your children don't visit? You know how it is. Sorry for your trouble. Don't be, I'm sorry I'm not very good. When did you learn to cut? I took on every possible jobs in the old days. I delivered food, milk, newspaper, even worked at a gas station. I learned to cut by watching. When did you study? I didn't. Looking at you. I'm reminded of my late father. Don't stab him with that. Let's cut the front. This man killed my sister. He may stab you with it. Jang-woo. He's like my father to me. Do not speak ill in front of him. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, I'll keep my eyes on you. Do you hear me, killer? You crossed the line, that's enough. Let's have lunch together next time. Take care of yourself, I'm off, sir. Come on, shuffle it better. Shall we begin? Buddy. Why're you bothering the pharmacist? He's a saint who brings meds to the sick. Cop! Cop! Cop! Get rid Of it! - Hurry up! - The cards! Hey. Something feels odd. Anyone gambling here? Come on, no gambling here. Don't do it, no more warnings. Don't talk nonsense, we'd never. What was that fish called 'rock trout'? I can't forget that taste, is it expensive? Not at all, want one ready? - There's no need. -When do you need it? - It's okay. - Should I call you? Hey! Yong-han! I didn't get caught once after installing this. That boar devours my fish and just takes off. Here it is. Whose car is that? White Avante, who could it be? It's the pharmacist. Was he here that day? What's he doing in the car? Stop! Again! Go back! That's Myung-gyu. What? Myung-gyu? So he was with her that day. Told you he was the one from day one! Fast forward. You accused the wrong man. Hey- Jang-woo! Where's he going? The boys? They went to blackmail that bald man. Idiots. But why's that bastard want me at the school? Yuhang Middle? Yeah. Perverted bastards, there's always something. Here. It was you. Si-eun Jang-woo... Where's Myung-gyu? Did you see him? Myung-gyu? I think he went home early. Yuhang Middle School Hey, Jang-woo. That night... when Eun-ji was killed... It wasn't me! I didn't kill her! Did you go to my place that night? Yeah, I was there. She said you locked her up, and needed to go to the salon, but she wasn't there. Did you see the pharmacist? The pharmacist? At Yong-han's shop, a white Avante! Oh, Avante White... No one was in the car! You're better than girls wanting sugar daddies. What? At least you're clear. All transaction, nothing more. Load of shit. You already wasted 10 minutes. I don't buy something like women. "Something"? Then why am I here? I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. Something's been pestering me and I wanted to check something. But looks like he's not coming. Here. Go on. Perverted bastard. It was you, right? Eun-ji and that woman. I'm kidding, just messing with you. Do I look like a chump who hides in the shadow, and rape and kill? What the hell'd you know?! Where the hell is he? Lee Si-eun Jang-woo, I think something“ happen here. That girl in the bus, she's with the pharmacist. Derelict school behind town... Room with grandfather clock... and cross reflection off a puddle! Hello? Si-eun? Si-eun? Goddammit! Some girl is with the pharmacist! Si-eun's there too! Who? Si-eun! Si-eun! The possessed girl! The shaman. They're at Yuhang! Goddammit! Will you come when there's a body? What's the name of that derelict school? Feeling better? Don't tire yourself out, come lie down. How did you know where to come? Do you really get visions? Si-eun! Asshole, I knew it was you all along! I told you I'd be watching you. You okay? Are you hurt? Homicide I told you it was him! Si-eun, go on, tell them. Where's the girl? The one he tried to kill. - But she's... - Sorry, I was mistaken. Si-eun, what's with you? You said on the phone... Nothing happened, there is no girl. What the hell's going on? She fainted outside, so I brought her in. He must've overreacted. Son of a bitch! He's the one! He parked at Yong-han's shop... Jang-woo. I'm doing everything I can to solve this case, I barely eat and sleep. There's a limit to my patience. Enjoyed playing shaman and jerking us off? Is it fun? Vandalism! Assault! Obstruction of justice! I'll lock you up for good! It was me! It's all me, he didn't do anything. I'll leave town. I'll disappear. They're fucking with us. You'll die. Please stop. No more. Get Mr. Suh's signature and release him. And keep Jang-woo overnight. Yes, sir. Mr. Suh? Check your name and address, then sign here. What's the hold up? Send him home at once. You're free to go. What did you do in the car? It's captured on CCTV. There's a witness who says you weren't inside. There are no coincidences. The brass bowl landed before you. And I chased you through the alleys. You're a tenacious one. Sure, it was me. Your overreaction led us to this situation. I loathed your sister's every word, every gesture. Take a look. My brother can... find me wherever I am. Even in the middle of the ocean. He'll find me. You son of a bitch! She really cared about you. But you were gambling while she was dying. Say 'yes', this evidence disappears. But she lives. Say 'no', you can have this, but she dies. Who am I talking about? So, delete or not? Delete? Just nod your head. Okay, delete. Jang-woo. Do you trust me? I'm taking Mr. Suh back. Your fish is ready. If it's a lot, I won't go. - Come by. - You're killing me. Okay, fine. I got another call. - Okay. - See you. What is it? You know that abandoned house on the hill? The one where a family was murdered. It was owned by a pharmacist back then. He got sick after his second marriage. He had a daughter, but turns out she was autistic. Then one day... I'm sick of that sound. She won't move without this snack. Looks like his entire family died. Only one person came out alive. Know who that was? It was Mr. Suh, the pharmacist. Isn't that weird? He only went to middle school, can pharmacists do that? Ma'am! Dad's acting up! He's not breathing! Ma'am! Please help him! Please! Help! I told you not to disturb me when he's here. It looks bad. Everyone's all messed up, shouldn't you at least be normal? You stupid moron! I told you not to disturb us! Are you deaf and dumb?! What a fucking moron! Suzy... Suzy? Suzy! What do we do now? The house is almost ours, let's finish this today. What about the boy? Let's eat first. This crab is so good. I gotta crack this open. So full of meat inside. Eat something. You should eat. - You son of a bitch! - Calm down! You can't do this! Si-eun, she's in danger. - You bastard! - Get him! It was you. Cross reflection off a puddle! The cross... I heard this place'll get demolished, so I moved back for old times' sake. Must I move again? Please stop this. Suzy... will want that too. Wood carving was my father's favorite hobby. Time would fly while he was carving. But that woman said this made too much mess, and she nagged and nagged! As soon as she joined my family, it all went to hell. My father, and Suzy... Sol killed her. With that. Did you sleep with him? All dirty things must die. Si-eun! You'll die. You must leave. You'll die here. I won't leave without you! Jang-woo... Jang-woo! No! Jang-woo! No! No! Suzy. Why're you still here? No. I can't stop now. Suzy? Suzy? Suzy? When Eun-ji was... 6 or so... My parents died in a car accident, and we were at their funeral. She held my hand tight, and said to me, "Don't cry, I'll always be by your side. Don't cry." That's who you took away. All torn apart, a bloody mess... in that cold water... I'll kill you, before I die. Motherfucker! - Sushi! - Little one! Sushi! A bit burned, right? It's okay. So long as it tastes good.
