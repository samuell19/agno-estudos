(theatrical music) (laser fire) (wall crumbling) (eerie music) - [Voiceover] Yeah that's what he tells me. - [Voiceover] What is that? (explosions) - Avalanche. (dramatic music) (growling) (screeching) (dramatic music) (screeching) (growling) (screeching) (dramatic music) (crashing and glass breaking) (dramatic music) (growling) (upbeat music) (light whimsical music) (snoring) (upbeat cartoon music) (ominous music) - Tommy, we've got to talk. - Uh. - Tommy hello. - You can't be real. - I'm real but I'm not solid. Actually I'm a mental image being projected directly into the visual and auditory centers of your brain. Nobody but you can see or hear me. Hey. - Then why are you here? - You've been selected by a coalition of intelligent species in the galaxy to defend your planet against an invader. If you fail, you and your entire civilization will be destroyed. Understand? - Okay. (eerie music) And I'm supposed to believe this? - [Girl] Yup. - So you're from some extremely advanced civilization, is that right? - That's right. - Well how come you look like a tiny teenage mall tramp? - Well it's simply a conventionalized projection designed to look familiar and unthreatening. - So if you're from an advanced civilization can I ask you some questions? - Well some things I cannot tell you, but I'll do my best. - All right. All right what's the meaning of life? - There is no meaning. It's just a coincidental outcome of the particular quanto crystallization of our universe. - Is there life after death? - No. - I mean does our spirit, our consciousness continue to exist even after the death of our physical bodies? - No. - Does Wendy Physcs really like me? - No, she's using you to make Arnie Beckworth jealous. She's also been sleeping with George Winston on the side in order to get better work assignments. - I knew it, damn her. Look this is completely ridiculous, I'm sorry and pardon me for saying so but why in the world would a galactic whatever pick me to defend the earth? I mean there'd have to be a lot of people better suited for this particular job. - Oh sure, half. - I'm sorry. - Exactly half of the people on the earth are better suited to defeat the invader than you. And exactly half are worse. You're dead in the center. That's why we selected you. - So who's this invader? - You mean you don't know. - Why should I know? It's been on every channel. Except for the possible exception of the cartoon network. Go ahead and switch, you'll see. - Stan Chambers here, reporting on the Aurora Mountain disaster, we're having trouble with our live transmission feed from Aurora Valley. For you viewers who just tuned in we're in the middle of a truly amazing story. - Well amazing's the word Stan, a gigantic animal, of apparently prehistoric origin has somehow emerged from the side of Mount Aurora, in Aurora County California. Now the animal of unknown species we understand is currently making its way in a north to north easterly direction but already it's caused massive damage even loss of life in the Aurora Valley area. - Just one moment Elizabeth. We do have an update, Governor Bill Wilkins has called out the California national guard and the forces are moving into the Aurora Valley area. - Stan I'm getting word now that we're getting back to our live feed, so I think we should switch live to Marty Carlson right in the Aurora Valley. - Stan, Elizabeth, I am standing on main street in front of the county court house in what used to be the heart of Aurora County. It is now a virtual ghost town. The entire Aurora Valley has been ordered evacuated. This is due entirely to a unprecedented natural disaster. The cause a single incredibly destructive animal. What you are hearing now from behind me is the sound of that animal as it moves through the center of town literally knocking buildings down as it advances. It appears to be heading in this direction, I, I don't know how much longer we'll be able to (screaming). - Oh, oh Stan something appears to be so wrong. - We are apparently having some transmission problems. We'll get back to Marty just as soon as we can. - [Voiceover] Across America starting at ... - We'll be bringing you that interview in full in just a little while. Once again this is Debbie Delverson coming to you from WRPT here in New Ark. Bringing you the latest in that terrifying story on the west coast. Right now we have Dr Stephanie Martin from the university of Trenton. She is a Crypto Zoologist, she's an expert in the study of unknown animal life. Thank you Dr Martin for being with us. - It's my pleasure. - So what, is the deal here? Is this a dinosaur that's come back to life? - Well I know that it's being referred to as a dinosaur by the popular media but in a word, no. As you can see there are a number of characteristics that make it very unlikely that this animal is a dinosaur. Well you'll notice the human like arms and the structure of the skull and then of course the size of the animal which is far larger than any (mumbles) animal known to science. Or even really considered to be possible by science. - But don't you think this could be a species that's not known by science? - Well no not really. Well in fact it's impossible that a dinosaur could have been living inside of Mount Aurora for 65 million years. You see Mount Aurora is only around 22 million years old. In fact Mount Aurora was formed by alluvial deposits that were made-- - Thank you Dr Martin. - Let's show you that footage again. (static hissing) - We'll be staying on the air to keep you updated on this amazing story. A terrible visitor from some lost prehistoric world alive in Southern California. - Monster (speaking in a foreign language). - It is clearly well over 180 feet tall, which in fact would make it by far the largest animal in the world. Far more massive than even the blue whale. Well which would make it very unlikely that this is a dinosaur or any creature evolved here on earth. - [Voiceover] Thank you Dr Martin so much that information. - Could you turn the sound down? - [Debbie] Once again this is Debbie Dolverson coming to you ... - Are you okay? (ominous music) - Yeah, yeah great. Swell. - Are you functional now? Can you listen to me? - Yeah, yeah I'm listening. - Okay ground rules first. Zarkorr cannot be defeated. - Zarkorr, who's Zarkorr? - That's the invader. Zarkorr. Now Zarkorr cannot be defeated by any earthly weapon utilized or, here write this down. I can only tell you this once, so it's important that you get it straight. - I have a tape recorder. - I'm speaking directly to your cerebral cortex. What good is a tape recorder going the be? - Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Point one, Zarkorr cannot be defeated by any earthly currently utilized or in development by any armed force on the earth. Understand? - What about nuclear weapons? - Nothing, nada. Not guns, tanks, A bombs, H bombs, anthrax bombs, slingshots, swords, sharp sticks, poison gas nothing that is currently utilized or under development by any armed force on the earth. - Right got it. - However the means do exist to defeat the invader. They exist here on earth, and they can be found and utilized by you, within the limited time frame available. - What do you mean limited time frame? - That's the next point. Zarkorr has been designed to hone in on you and is currently making his way to you by the shortest route possible. So if you're thinking about dodging the mission by running away, this would be a very temporary solution. Zarkorr would track you down. Where ever you ended up, he'd kill you. You cannot hide from Zarkorr. Got it? - Got it. But how am I supposed to kill it? - Next point. Your course of action is strictly up to you. You can use whatever resources you can find, technical resources, scientific resources, human resources. Other than what I'm telling you now we can offer you no assistance whatever. Write it down. - Yeah, no assistance whatever. Look I'm sorry but I thought superior beings were supposed to be morally superior. I need to tell you something there is nothing moral about this, this is totally immoral. You cannot do this to me, or us. The human race. - We're superior beings, so our moral code allows us to do whatever we want to do to you. - Great what else? - Well, um, that's really about it. Oh one hint Zarkorr contains the key to his own destruction. So uh, good luck. Bye. Oh one other thing that I'm allowed to tell you the faster you undertake positivity action against the invader, the greater the chances of success. Bye. - How in Gods name am I supposed to fight a 180 foot dinosaur? (dramatic music) (growling) (dramatic music) (explosions) (screeching) (dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (incoherent talking) - Okay people we'll be back in two minutes. - Oh god. Do we have any new footage or anything. What am I supposed to say? So where's the Crisco zoologist? Huh, huh. - In wardrobe. - Excuse me can you tell me where the wardrobe department is? - It's in the corner over that way. - Thanks. - Is she a bore or what? And then I try to get her to shut up and she just keeps going on and on and on. (banging) - Oh, sorry. - Wait you're the expert, right? - Yeah I guess. - I need to talk to you. It's very important. - Okay well look I got to be back on the air in a couple of seconds maybe-- - No it's very important. I mean extremely important. Unbelievably important. - Who are you exactly? Do you work here? - No I don't I saw you on TV so I came down here to find you. - I don't think you're supposed to be back here. - No I'm not. I know that but I need to talk to you. Look this is not easy for me, I don't know how to say this. - Are you a mail man? - No, I'm not a mail man, i'm a postal employee there's a difference. - Oh right. - No, no, no it's very urgent. You need to listen to me right now. - Oh my god, if you touch me I will scream. - I'm not going to touch you. I don't want to touch you, I just want to talk to you. Listen I know what I'm about to say is going to sound crazy, but I'm not crazy, really I'm not. You've got to listen to me. I was contacted by an alien a while ago, actually she looked like a tiny little mall tramp, but she said that was just a mental projection. She told me that I'm the one who's been chosen to defeat Zarkorr. - Zarkorr. - Zarkorr right, that's the name of the monster, Zarkorr. And I'm the one that's been chosen to defeat him. - Oh my god. - But I don't know how. So I came down here to find you. Listen can't we go somewhere and talk please. - Help. - Security to stage eight. - [Dr Martin] Help me. - [Tommy] Please don't scream. - There's a crazy post man over here. - What's the deal here, what's happening. Oh are we on? (screams) - What the hell's going on there? - We've got a problem down here. Can someone tell me what's happening? Please. - Oh Christ. - Over here, down that way. - Just stay away from me. I just want to talk to her. - Okay everybody back off. - He's crazy, would you get me out of here. - Okay back off everyone. Clear a way. Go on back off out of the way. - This isn't turning out like I expected. - Okay mister we don't want anyone to get hurt. - Listen I know this is hard to explain, but you just can't take me to jail it's impossible. - Oh we won't take you to jail. - Yeah right we're only authorized to escort you off the property. So why don't you put down the C stand and just go on about your business. - Look I'm not crazy and I'm not stupid either. - Okay I believe you, you're not stupid. In that case I believe you know what this is. This is a gun. Put down the C stand or I will take this gun and shoot you and then you will die. - Shoot him. Just shoot him, just shoot him. - Please excuse me lady I've got the situation under control here. (gasping) Okay fella what's it going to be? - See, there you go. No problem. Okay everybody. - Drop it. Drop the gun, drop it and then back away. - Don't do it, look it's all my fault. Joe just shoot him. Shoot through my body. - Don't try it, you get back in the corner. (ominous music) - What is going on here? - Just get out of here. - Right the police are out front. - Did you hear that mister? The police are here, what are you going to do now? - You listen to me drop the gun on the floor and kick it over here. Right now. - You're doing something really stupid. - You do something smart and give me that gun or I'll start shooting. I'm not kidding. - Okay. - Don't do it. - Get up. Back off. Come on. I need you to help me. I won't hurt you, but I'm not leaving here without you. Back off. Come on walk. Walk. You're going to be all right. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise. Back off. (screaming) - [Dr Martin] Let go of me. - I'm sorry. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it you just need to talk to me. I just need your help. Stop it. (panting) This is a disaster. What the hell am I supposed to do now? - Just stay calm everything is going to be okay. - Everything's going to be okay? What are you nuts? I told you that... (police sirens) Skip it, we're doomed. That's it I'm going to end up in a nut house or in a jail somewhere until Zarkorr comes along and squashes me and then destroys the whole world. - No, no, no I want the building evacuated now. - Look all I'm asking for us is to keep one of our guys with a minicam here, I mean this is major news. - Excuse me, excuse me but does the word no mean anything to you? - Look all I'm say-- - Excuse me but does the word now mean anything to you? - Okay, okay but this is an abuse of authority. - Look I want this building emptied out and I want it emptied out now. Thank you. (dramatic music) - This whole thing is my fault. Let me get in there and I'll tackle him. - No. - Hey you guys got a swat team or something? - Can you believe this? And all because you're a reasonable person. And this whole thing is totally ridiculous. I'm going to save the world. What a joke. - No, no, no, I believe you. I mean why shouldn't you be the one to save the world? - You had your chance. If you're going to patronize me at least do a better job of it. - All right don't you guys want to wait for some backup units? - Excuse me, but was that advice you were offering me? - Sorry. - Look you planning on taking over or planing this operation? - No, no I wasn't planning that. Sorry. - You two guys get lost. Come on let's go check this guy out. (dramatic music) - Okay right look, the remote trucks are being set up in the front. - What about getting a camera in here? - Don't worry about it our lawyers are taking care of everything now. With any luck they'll be doing this all day. - Oh please, please. Oh yes, yes. (dramatic music) - [Voiceover] Police open up. - Go away. - Open up in there. - Don't try anything. I'm armed and I have a hostage. - He's a postal worker. - Okay, look everything will be all right. - Another optimist. Excuse me would you mind coming over here a minute? - Me, why? - Because I want to use you as a human shield. And I'm armed and dangerous. Now do you mind please. Now. Now I want you to open up the door. Just a little bit, very slowly. That's enough. Okay guys listen up I want you to back away. You're making me very nervous. - I'm backing up. Okay, now how's that? - A little bit further. Please. - There, now can we talk? - Guys, yeah I guess so. - So what's the problem? - Guys I know how bad this looks, but I'm not crazy. I don't have any grudges, I don't want to hurt anybody. I'm just an average guy. But something happened to me this evening. I can't prove it, I know that. But you gotta listen to me please. This monster, this thing that appeared in California is not a dinosaur or a mutation or anything like that. It's from outer space. It's a kind of test. It's a test of the human race. No army can stop it. No weapons, no H bombs, nothing. I know, I've been told. I was visited. An alien being appeared to me this evening. At first I didn't believe it but she told me about the monster before I saw it on TV. So I knew it had to be real. And she told me that I've been chosen to defeat Zarkorr. That's the name of the monster. And she told me that I'm the only one who can do it. So if you lock me up that would be the end of everything. This monster will home in on me and kill me. And then destroy all human civilization. - Why is it exactly that this alien picked you to defeat Zerkonian. - Zarkorr. Because I'm the median human, I'm dead average. Look I know how totally unsuited I am for this job. I mean I've only been at it an hour and a half and I'm already about to be shot. Or locked up in a nut house or jail but I didn't say I was any good at it. But I'm the one they picked. Please, please. - Larry I believe him. - Yeah right. Yeah I believe him too. - No, no you don't understand I'm not trying to fool him I really do believe him. - What? - Don't you know what's been going on? With UFO's. They've been watching us for centuries. I mean look at the evidence. Abductions, cattle mutilations. They're all around us. - George. - I mean you have to look at the evidence. And if an alien civilization can cross trillions of miles of space who says they can't create a monster. - George just calm-- - I mean what other explanation is there? - George go to the patrol car now. - No Larry I'm serious. How else can you explain a giant monster just appearing like this? It makes sense that the other civilizations in the galaxy would be testing us. What if he's telling the truth? If we lock him up it could mean the end of civilization. - George can we talk about this later? - Larry you know I respect you. - Oh my god. - But I'm afraid I'm going to have to take your gun. - George have you gone totally and completely and in every other way out of your mind? I'm not going to let you do this. - Larry I love you like an older brother but I've got to go with my gut. And if you don't give me that gun I'll be forced to shoot ya. - George you're throwing away your career. - Dammit civilization is at stake. Okay I'm counting. Five-- - Please let's talk about this George. - Four. Three. Two. - Okay, okay take it. - If I come out of this thing alive so help me god I am going to sue the New Ark police department and I will bankrupt you. - Lady that's really top one on the list of my current problems right now. - Larry get your hands up. Assume the position against that wall. Now move it. - [Larry] George. - Look I'm sorry about this Larry but we're going to need some get away time. (mumbling) Larry cut it out. You're going to strain your throat. Look we better get out of here. Backup should be coming any second. We taking her? - Yes. - Right. - Well let's see if we can find a back way out of this place. Stay behind me. Anybody start shooting, get down. - Okay. Lets go. Don't scream or he'll shoot ya. - Where exactly are you taking me? - I don't know. I haven't figured that out yet. (dramatic music) (mumbling) - [Dr Martins] Let go of me now. I told you look there is no way out of here. - Sorry lady that's my squad car. Put her in the back. - [Dr Martins] Let go. (dramatic music) (police sirens blaring) (screeching) (explosions) (dramatic music) (screeching) - I'm sorry what's your name? - George. - George you got a radio or anything? - Yeah here hold on. - We need to get some news on this thing. - Yeah it's right down there. - Be careful with that it's Larry's. - I will. - [Voiceover] And all national guard units have been completely wiped out. Reports indicate the Aurora monster has proven invulnerable to attacks by bazooka teams, stinger missiles and heavy artillery. Hold on we're going remote. - [Voiceover] Hello this is Loyd Ink, I'm stationed with the national guard command post on the side of Mount Tiko we can the monster around a mile away moving up the valley due east directly toward us. As we've reported before the president has given special authorization for air force bombers to undertake an assault against the monster with Napalm bombs. We can hear the aircraft moving in now. Hold on, there they go. The valley is exploding in fire. God what a sight huge balls of fire exploding one after the other. We can see the monster burning in the middle of the flames. The whole forest is on fire all around it. I can't quite see anything through the smoke right now I think the monster's gone down. Jesus Christ no he's still coming it hasn't even been touched. It's shooting lightning bolts from its eyes. The planes are being blown from the skies one by one. (dramatic music) - Can we talk now? - This isn't possible. Nothing on earth could survive something like that. - Look even if you don't believe me you're here, you're stuck. Let's just pretend that I'm telling the truth, now this alien told me certain things, hold on, let's assume for the sake of a argument that all this is true, okay. Okay? - Fine. - Now this is what she said. She said Zarkorr can't be defeated by any earthly weapon currently being used or under development by any armed force on earth. That includes nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, everything. Look the way I see it is this, this whole thing is layed out so that I'm the only one who can figure this thing out and if it's not me, then it's nobody. Does that make sense? - Makes perfect sense to me. - Yeah okay me too. - I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do. The thing is the alien said that it can be destroyed and there is a way for me to find out how. But I just have to figure it out and that's why I came to get you, to find you. I need more information. I need to find out more about Zarkorr. I need your help. Please. I can't force you to cooperate. - Could probably force her. - No please, just think for a minute, you said it yourself it's not from this earth. Now if this monster came from outer space and that much is true, then why not the rest? - He convinced me. - Oh god I got to think. - [Voiceover] Any unit in the vicinity we have a 417 in progress one officer held hostage. - Yeah we may have to think on foot, they just found Larry they're looking for us. - What do we do now? - Well we're going to have to take a chance that we don't get spotted for another five minutes or so. Now I can hide the squad car where it won't be found but after that we're pretty much on our own. I mean I don't have any other wheels handy we're just gonna have to hoof it. - Okay, (dramatic music) let's do it. (dramatic music) - Why do I get the feeling that the rest of my life is going to be just like this? - Where can we go? - Well I can think of three places where we can't go. Your place, my place and her place. Any other ideas. - Not that I can think of. You're the expert. - Uh huh, you are. Where we go kind of depends on what you wanna do. - God. - Look you've been chosen, read the bible Moses didn't like it either. That's life. - She said that Zarkorr contained the key to his own destruction. That was a hint. - No it's a tautology. Okay everything contains the key to it's own destruction. - [Tommy] She said it was a hint. - What the hell's a tautology? - It can't be just that she made a big point out of it. She said Zarkorr contains the key to his own destruction. And whatever that key is it's something that the government can't find and the military isn't going to find, only I can find it. But what the hell could it be? (dramatic music) Look, look I need your help. And if I can't have it then there's no point in me dragging you around with me. Either way I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not dangerous. And I'm not crazy either. You tell me if Zarkorr didn't come from outer space then where the hell did he come from? - I don't know. No it is not from earth, it can't be. It's totally ridiculous, but it can't be. You're right. - I don't know if you can help me, but right now you're all I've got. - What am I supposed to do? There is no such thing as an expert in alien life. - Are you going to help me or not? - Okay, I know a place we can go. Here. - Maybe I am crazy, everyone seems to be acting as if I'm crazy. It doesn't make much sense, I mean why'd they pick me? I don't know she said it's because I'm the average guy but that sounds crazy. Then this little thing she just vanished and I had no idea what to do next but she left me a list of stuff that I was supposed to keep in mind. And then I saw Stephanie on TV so I went down to the station to try to talk to her because she's an expert but she wouldn't believe me so I had to force her to believe me and then George finally did believe me but the police are looking for us. And we had to hide the patrol car so they wouldn't find us. And we took a bus-- - Hey man this isn't funny. - Noway don't pay attention to him okay, it's a nervous habit (laughing) - So you want me to help you destroy this, this Zarkorr? - [George] Christ let's get out of here. - No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's cool, it's cool, it's cool. It's surreal. It's cosmic. I like it. I like it, oh yeah. It's cool, it's cool. - So can you get us the information we need? - Arthur can get anything he's a hacker. Actually he'd be in jail right now if he hadn't erased his own indictment file from the DA's database. - Excuse me Stephanie not hacker. Hacker is a demeaning term, I prefer cyber-naught. - Cyber naught. - As in a sailor through cyber space. Okay hold on now. Hold on. Okay. Okay. I'm writing a little program here which is going to search for any references to Zarkorr on the net. However we have to limit ourselves a little bit because we don't care what any ordinary schmucks have to say, do we? No, no, no, no, no, no. We're looking for labs, military data coms, pentagon feeds, university chit chat. Here let's try a little bit of encrypted satellite info, that usually turns you the goodies. So are you two going out? Are you two? What about you two? Any combinations of (mumbles)? No, oh. So you work for the post office huh. - Yeah. - Cool. Cool. (laughing) Okay we've got to let this baby compile a little bit and see what she comes up with. So you got a girlfriend? - No not really. - Oh so you, you go to prostitutes huh? - No. - I'll bet he does. - I see what you mean about social skills. - It only gets worse. - Stephanie here lost here virginity to her literature professor. Barnard. When I was a kid I tapped her home phone line and she called him up, they talked all about it. - Shut up. - You wanna listen to the tape? - Arthur shut up. - How long's it going to take for the data to come up? - It'll take awhile. Yeah, yeah. It'll take awhile. It'll take awhile, but it's cool, it's okay, you guys you guys could hide out here. I could order lunch. But I'm not going to pay for yours. You got to pay for it yourself. Anybody feel like Mexican? I live off of the disability and interest that I got from this money I won in a law suit from this kid, this kid from (mumbles) he hit me with his motor scooter, he crippled me. Crippled me for life. But he was a rich kid. Lucky me, lucky me, lucky me. - [Voiceover] (mumbles) to the federal court on behalf of the United Environmental defense fund to seek an injunction to prevent further aggressive against the Aurora monster. - That's right all the evidence we have indicates that this animal, and we don't like to call it a monster, is completely unique. It's one of a kind and it's our position that it falls under the protection of the endangered species act. - But Mr Bergman this animal has caused hundreds of fatalities and caused millions of dollars of property damage. - That is not relevant to the (mumbles) in question they do not distinguish between dangerous animals and benign ones. And let me jut add one more thing that the actions already taken against this animal including the use of napalm in the Mount Tiko Valley, which is just unbelievable. But not only my guess have already fatally injured the Aurora animal but it most certainly will have profound negative consequences for the red tipped dwarf owl which lives only in that region. - Is that so. - Okay, okay, here I come. Here I come get ready. Okay, okay okay these are the first stacks of hard copy, there's more on the way a lot more. More on the way. (dramatic music) - Okay let's start saving the world. (dramatic music) (screeching) (explosions) - Energy, energy that's all it really is. - [Voiceover] Laser light doesn't leave footprints. - Well you see that's the problem. If this technology's so far advanced of ours then it's impossible to say what it could do. This thing doesn't eat, it doesn't bleed, it doesn't breathe. It can't be hurt by any kind of material defense so how do you shoot a beam of light? - How do you? - You hit the off switch. - No, no, no no that makes sense. - Look there isn't going to be any off switch okay, or whatever that means. If they could make this thing then they could certainly make the switch inaccessible. - Of course that's the point. If they wanted to destroy the earth that's what they would have done. But they need to make the means of destroying this monster accessible to me. - And not anybody else. - No no one else is going to think of an off switch. They're not going to bother to look for it. How can they know what we know? - But it could be anywhere. It could look like anything. - Look last night this monster came out of that mountain and some time before that it must have been turned on. Generated, brought to life, whatever. That's where we need to look, that's where the switch was flipped. We need to see what happened in the mountain at the time that the monster appeared. When they first turned it on. - Say no more, say no more, say no more. I am on it. I am on it. You want your weather data, you want your satellite photos. You want your seismic reports. You want your radar anomalies. I got it, got it, got it. Warning, warning, warning. Come on get back. Get out of my way. Okay, okay. This is cool okay we're starting at eight pm and we're wining our way through the seismic data. It will stop at the first indication of seismic activity. There it is at 8:18 pm. You see it? It only gets progressively worse. And there it is, there it is at 10:03 pacific time. - Go back to the beginning. - Yeah what was that? That was it. That's when it was turned on or implanted or whatever at 6:23. It must have taken a few hours for it to charge or grow large enough to appear again at 8:18. - But what do we do with it? - We have to look for something else that happened at the same time. At the moment that spark appeared in the mountains something else must have happened. If I'm right. - I'm checking, I'm checking, checking, checking clear the way, clear the way, clear the way. Okay satellite data. No, no 6:25. High pressure center. No no change, no change, nothing, nothing. Wait. Military radar. Top secret for my eyes only. I'm just kidding. Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait I gotta break a few codes. Um. - What? - We're in violation of federal law. - Big deal. - Oh yeah, did you ever see that movie with Linda Blair? When she's in a women's prison and they (mumbling). Bingo. We got a glitch. - Where? - This is radar data from from, from, from Grasso. From Oak Shield, from Red Watch. From all over California. Yep, quarter second. Quarter second radar failure at 6:24. Hold on I'm checking control tower data. You see, you see, you see the same deal. 6:24. - Can you chart up, show me all the stations that had that glitch all the ones that had it at the same time 6:24? - Sure, sure, sure, sure I can tap into anything they can come up with those bastards. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Now I'm going to do a kind of a graphic kind of chart thing for you here. Okay, okay, okay. Here we have two (mumbles) and they create a little egg. - [Stephanie] That's weird. - So if Mount Aurora is one of the two points... - Well just have to do some high powered calculating, won't we. Yes, yes. - What's up? - [Stephanie] We may have found something. - Hey boo-boo, we've got ourselves a great big picnic basket for ya. There we have the full size. Major focus at your favorite spot and mine. Mount Aurora California. And minor focuses at Yuma Arizona. - [Voiceover] Yuma Arizona. - Actually about 50 miles north of Yuma right on the California border. Okay here we go, here we go. Williston Arizona population 235. Major industry Herman's gas station on the corner. - Gee I don't know about this. I mean it seems awfully thin for us to just go running off to Arizona. What are we supposed to do when we get there? - I didn't know you were planing on coming. - Oh um, well. - Ah, it's a romance. It's a romance. - Arthur shut up. - Don't get me wrong you're welcome to. - Well I guess I just thought that I was onboard. But I still don't know if we should just go running off to Arizona. - Here's something. Look what we have here. Seismic readings at 6:23. Here, here, here. In the totally unfault like terrain of the scorpion state see it? Still thin huh? Still thin, ah it's very thin. - Okay, okay Arthur okay. Okay I'm convinced. But what are we going to do when we get there? - Why are we going to Arizona? - To find Zarkorrs off switch. - Zarkorrs off switch is in Arizona? - Now say thank you. - Why. - Well first because I didn't have you arrested and more recently because I just booked you on a flight for Phoenix Arizona leaving from New Ark at about 3:05. From there you'll catch a commuter flight that'll put you down in hope at the Tommy Marshal air field, that's just outside of Yuma, it's about 40 miles from Williston. I've arranged for a rental car to be delivered there for your enjoyment and edification. Stephanie you've got a lot of work to do now. You get these guys measurements, take them into town and buy then some clothes. Do you want to show up at the airport with a cop and a mailman? Tommy ol' boy this is a global positioning receiver. The seismic and radar data can only pinpoint the location with in 1000 yards, with this you know you're in the right place. And then, then you're on your own you sorry bastard you. Okay guys, okay guys get to work. Get to work. - I can't get this global positioning thing to work. - Holy Christ. The whole town is gone. - [Stephanie] No it isn't. Look up there. - Where? - Those lights up there. - We got trouble. - Okay let's get ready. (ominous music) - Wow this is really eerie. - We've made a pilgrimage into the desert. The wilderness of sin, it's all part of the mythic journey to the god state. I mean could be. I guess. - We've got company. - Okay just hold your ground. - Well you folks sure took your good sweet time in getting here. Well you are the government people we sent for aren't you? - That's right and you're marshal-- - Sheriff. Sheriff Rockard. - Right sheriff well I'm Dr Martin from the state department. - Howdy. - Nice to meet you. This is Dr Ward. - Please to meet you. - And Dr-- - Dr Ray. You can call me George. - George. Well this here's Ben Wells he's our local geologist. - Welcome doctor. - Thank you, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - [Ben] Pleasure doctor. Thank you for coming. - [Tommy] Mr Wells. - And this here's Quincy he runs the dinner here. - I'm Dr Ward. (grunts) So sheriff lets see what you got. - Well no we were just kind of hoping you'd tell us that. Follow me. (dramatic music) - What you are seeing here are previously recorded scenes of the aurora monster filmed along his destructive trek originating at Mount Aurora California and continuing east through Arizona. Current reports indicate the Aurora animal has changed its course. It is now on a heading that will take it just north of Yuma, provided military-- - Tommy it's changing direction. I think it's coming after you. (dramatic music) - That's comforting. - Oh my god. - Turn that thing off. - [Quincy] It's okay buddy. (ominous music) - Did anybody see it hit? - Hell yeah came down like a cannon shot. - Yeah we've been calling around for the last couple of days trying to get somebody to come down here and take a look at this thing. Hell to my way of thinking this just ain't natural. - Let's get it cleared off. (mumbles) (ominous music) - So has it done anything since it got in here? - Nope just sort of sits around. But I did find something interesting. - [Stephanie] What's that? - I tried to do a scratch test on it to see what it was made out of. Watch this. This is a diamond. Watch. (ominous music) All right explain that? - Hell buddy here tried an arc welder on it. Didn't do a damn thing. - Tell you what if this things harder than a diamond there's nothing on this earth that's going to open this up. Providing something's inside of it. - God these look like windows. Have you tried to open it? - Doctor we've done everything humanly possible to try to penetrate this and we can't do it. (ominous music) - Let's get it in the car. - Now hold on, Doctor how do we know that by you moving this thing it's not going to explode? - Yeah. - We don't. And if I were you I'd get out of way. (dramatic music) - [Voiceover] Hey, hey you doctor, doctor. Hey there. I'd like to see some credentials. Hey. - Now you just wait a minute right now. You, did you ever hear of national security? Did ya? - Now you just wait a second. - No you wait, all of ya. Now are any of you aware that this country is in the midst of a crisis of international and interplanetary importance? Are ya? - What are you talking about? Oh you mean that monster? - What are you some sort of god damn question asker? Well mister where I come from we know when to ask questions and we know when to button our lips and follow orders. Am I getting through to you? - Now you just hold on. - You hold on. Are you an appointed officer of the law? Have you been pledged to uphold the laws of this state and the constitution? - Now just wait a minute. - Are you an American? Sheriff do you know what it means to be an American? - I think I-- - Oh you think you do. You think you do. So you don't know what it means to be an American. Well maybe you aught to get sure what it means to be an American before you start being a question asker. - George it won't fit. - We need something to tie down the trunk. - You give me your belt. - What? What do you want my belt for? - Oh I see more questions huh. How about national emergency is that a good enough answer for you? - Give him the belt Barry. - Come on Barry give him your belt. - Oh this is the damnedest thing I've ever heard of. - Send us an invoice we'll compensate you for it. - [Stephanie] Yeah send it attention Bureau Special Operations Washington DC. - [George] That's district of Columbia. - I know where it is. (dramatic music) - Where to now? - The monster. - What about the sphere? We don't have any idea how it works or what to do with it. - Don't worry about it I've got it covered. (dramatic music) - What do you mean? Do you know what you're doing? - I've got it covered. Just get me to Zarkorr. (dramatic music) (screeching) (explosions) (dramatic music) (explosion) (screeching) - Showtime boys and girls. Roadblock. (dramatic music) - [Voiceover] Sorry folks road's closed. - Look officer my mothers deaf and she's living alone and I've got to get into town to get to her. - Just relax the town was evacuated, what's your mother name? - Maddy, Maddy Ray. - [Voiceover] What's her address? (dramatic music) - 88 main street. - Hold on. - Damn bad move. - God what are we going to do now? - Should we try to rush the barrier? - [Tommy] He's coming back. - It's trouble, look how he's walking. (dramatic music) - I'm sorry folks I'm going to have to ask you to step out from the vehicle. (ominous music) Miss. - What's wrong? - Please step out. (dramatic music) Sir, sir. Please keep your hands in sight. - Okay, okay no trouble. - Over here please. Sir? - Me too? - Yes sir. Please. - George, Stephanie thanks for everything.
