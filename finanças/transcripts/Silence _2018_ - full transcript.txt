Hey special K. Hey. Jen I have coffee. I have coffee, can't do that And I'm light so you better look out. Oh no... are you wasted? I was enjoying the sun. Where are your shoes? In my bag. What happened, did the wife come back home? Was it emotional? Where there tears? Did she drag you by your hair? Toss you the the curb? Maybe. - Whatever - Oh your hair looks good. You know I love you unconditionally right? So you're not gonna hate me when I tell you you should probably fix yourself a bit more before our boss sees us because I know what you do when your time zone. And I don't think she really wants you, and I don't really want you to get fired because you're my best friend I love you. So you gonna put on your shoes and your coat? Oh don't you fucking... Mam, mam... There's a line you don't cross. Don't cross it, don't finish my coffee. You've finished my coffee before. But there's more inside your house so it's fine. It's the principle of the thing I think. Maybe not. Good morning ladies. Jenna, I understand why you're late but Caitlyn, really? Hey I'm off tomorrow, see you later? Yeah! Are we doing lunch today? No not today, I'm having lunch with my dad. It's my mum's birthday. Right, you said something about that. - Another time. - Yeah. Hello free financial how may I help you? Hey you.

Hey, I have.. those are for you. Great. So, when are you gonna talk to Tony. He's hot, and he wants you. Are you really talking about this at work? He works you, you work here, why not? Maybe because I don't want to talk to someone who just wants to have sex with me. - Why don't you ask him out? - Sex? You don't know that, he's gorgeous but... he wants nothing to do with me. OK I'll talk to him, now will you get out of here? Thank you for calling Valvery financial call center, this is Caitlyn how can I help you? Hey baby girl how's your day going? Hi daddy how are you?

How did you manage that? - Thank you. - Thank you. Jenna she's been bothering me about asking this guy from work out and... So did you ask him out? Well... Didn't go very well? That's an understatement. Why is this so hard for me dad I've had 3 serious relationships in my life and they all split because I won't put out. Baby girl when you find the right guy, that's not gonna matter to him. He's gonna value you for you. Can we talk about something else dad? Fine, whatever. What do you want to talk about? What are we doing tonight? We'll go to the cemetery and pay our respects like we usually do. And having dinner after-wards yeah? It's our usual dinner night so... Dad. It's been 13 years, maybe it's time you tried going on a date with someone. We'll find a hooker. Caitlyn Elizabeth! Ok... I can't believe you said that. But I will try. But you have to promise me you'll try too. - I... - You heard me. Now finish your lunch. You're gonna be late for work. Oh right Still can't believe you're eating off the kids menu. That's personal. I like my fried chicken OK? You always have!. Yes, OK Mrs Summer, I'll talk to you next week. Bye. - Hey Caitlyn. - Hi Tony. Look I'm really sorry about earlier. Hey, don't worry about it.

I can't tonight, I'm having dinner with my dad, we're celebrating my mum's birthday. How about tomorrow or Friday? I think tomorrow sounds great! OK awesome, do you just wanna go from work? Er I'll pick you up at your house if you're OK with that? OK, yeah well, I have to get going so... Alright sounds good. There's a peach if I ever saw one. Yeah, yeah she's something else. I'd love to get with that for a night. Easy buddy I'm taking her out tomorrow night. Really? Damn, maybe I should have hit that before you. Are you fucking serious, have you ever heard of sexual harassment. Every day. It doesn't mean shit to me. OK well what if I take this to the boss? Go ahead, no witnesses, no problems for me. Except for me you fucking dosh bag! Judas, you are such a sick fuck, no go do your shitty ass job. Or maybe, I'll run your name through the FBI database. Am I gonna find something there that you won't like? Be nice to me you fucking whore! Really ass hole? Wow Tony, Tony! Come on chill. Dog you need to go. Go, go walk it out. You all saw that he assaulted me you're all witnesses. Heck no, nobody saw anything. So dude, really? - You need to... - Fucking dyke. Dude, what an ass hole. Oh my god what happened? That creepy ass Judas was making eyes at you when Tony was totally ready to kick his ass. Told you he liked you. I know. He asked me on a date right before. Really? You go wild woman! Woo! Stop it. So, you gonna get some of that right? OK, bye Jenna!!! You're gonna tell me! Nope! Hi Mamma. Happy birthday. Er... I have some news for you this year. Not the same old stuff. Er. I have a date, with a guy named Tony from my department. He's so nice Mamma, and good looking and so respectful and... Everything you ever told me I should look for in a guy. I think you'd like him. He's nothing like any of the other guys Iâ€™ve dated before. He said... our princesses have to kiss a few frogs in life. Jen and I... we're still friends. We're going in out later this week. We're gonna go dancing. We do it every other week from Liz and Tash from work. I told you about them, a few years ago. It's really nice having them. I'm here with dad, as always and before I let him talk, I'm gonna read you something. I'll try not to cry. My mum made me laugh. Wiped my tears, hugged me tight. Cheered me on as I succeeded. And picked me up when I fell. She was strong when I couldn't be. And yes, drove me a little crazy, at times with all the worrying. But... I know and understand it was because she loved me. And wanted to protect me. Mums are promised from God you will always have a place to call home. A shoulder to cry on, and a friend to depend on forever. I love you forever more. Always. Caitlyn to Mamma. Are you OK daddy? Hi my angel. Happy birthday my love. I'm having a real hard time this year. But this... you'd think after 13 years, I'll be able to move on compose myself, but I just can't. Oh God Marilyn, I miss you. You'd be so proud of our baby girl. She's grown up to be an amazing woman. She's doing amazing things with her life. I know you're looking down on us and you're so proud of her just like I am. We miss you my love. I'll see you soon. karaoke days. - I can't believe how young Jen and I are. - Yeah. Still got this, sort of red hair. So tell me a little bit more about this Tony guy. Well I don't know a lot about him dad. He works on the same floor that I do. He must have been there longer than I have. I'm gonna say about 3 years. He's tall, he has brown hair gorgeous brown eyes. He's really nice. He sounds really nice. Do you know where you guys are going? No. You're gonna tell me when you find out right? Yes dad. Caitlyn, don't ever blank me. What? Don't be a lone. What do you mean? Look at me, I'm alone, I've been mooring your mum for the last 13 years. Dad it's OK I get it. Do you? Do you get it? Dad! Stop it. - I'm pathetic, I mean I'm just... - Dad! Stop. You have dealt with this the best way you have. You had a kid to raise too. I miss her too. I think about her every single day. She was my mum. But, maybe it's time for you to get back out there. And I think you are coming to terms with that and because of that it's made this year so much harder on you because you're just not ready to take that first step. It's OK to take your time but... you have to move on at some point. I love you. I love you to kiddo. So how did your date with your dad go? It was OK just really emotional. You want talk about it? I mean it's just, my dad this thing with my mum is so hard on him. I want him to move on. And he won't! Exactly. Can I make a suggestion? That depends on what it is. Let me hook him up? No!. I want him to enjoy himself, not ENJOY himself. It'll work out in the end it's fine. So how did your date go? Or do I need to ask? OK. Why is it guys can't make it last more than 2 minutes? Girl you are asking the wrong woman. Like you have any answers either Tash. Why you all thinking the due bar? The Bomb really? Enough you guys. Anybody have answers? You know my answer. Whore. What about you Liz? You don't want my answer. I'd like to hear it. How about, laziness? In a hurry. Can't commit, doesn't want to be with you long. Gotta get back to the wife and kids. Oh taken a nerve? Stop it. No let's see where she's going with this. Anything else? You'd like to ask? Ermmm, nah, that's it for today. You got my drift. Bitch. You need to loosen up Liz. Like that will ever happen. There's always, ah la, la la alcohol y'all! What's up Tony! I actually have to stay a little bit longer today. Oh do you want to reschedule? Oh no I was just wanting to see you're cool a bit later. Oh yeah that's fine I just thought maybe you were... Ooooooo girl you ain't getting outta that date chick just go with it! Stupid whore. Nice try y'all. Yeah that's fine I'll find you after-wards. OK sounds good. Bye. Nice try y'all! I'm not sure I wanna eat that now. God I'm sorry about this. No it's fine I know what it's like to have to work late. Yeah but this is getting in the way of our date. - Was is it? - We haven't even gone to dinner yet. Does that mean we can't kiss? I mean I guess not. So. Why is it you don't have a boyfriend? Boy you just get straight to the point don't you. We can talk about something else. It's fine. I just, I'm not good at choosing my men. Er, how many boyfriends? 3. Why? I'm not easy. What do you mean? I'm not easy, I don't believe in sex before marriage. I get it. Sorry I should have kept that to myself it's pretty personal. Oh man, you're good. I should just keep my big mouth shut. I can dig myself into some pretty deep holes. So what about you? What about me? What about you and women? Well I've had one serious relationship in my life time. Other than that, just one or two muppets. So about the same as me? Awesome, don't feel so bad. So what about your parents? Er, my mum died 13 years ago with breast cancer. My dad used to work at the rail roads, but he couldn't take it after she passed. Enough about my family, what about yours? Er well, my parents are divorced, they split up a few years ago. My mum has been a school teacher and my dad is an accountant. I had no good time growing up. Er... Me and my dad didn't get along super well, and my mum was, well, my mum. What does that mean? Closet drunk She'd drink and no one knew. Oh. Do you like music? Yes why? Come on. Hey that's beautiful. Thanks. I wanna see you again. We haven't even made it to dinner. Yeah but, just at the office. So. Well erm... Fairly certain you like me and... it's obvious I like you too. OK well I'm gonna tell you this. The only way we will sleep together, is if we fall asleep on the couch. And if you can't understand that then this isn't gonna work. Hey, I get it, I really do... Let's go get dinner. OK! Well. Here we are. Yep. Had a good time tonight. I did too Tony. I just wanna take things slow. I know. Good night. Good night. - So how did you do? - Great I really like him Jen. How much? Not that much! He was a perfect gentlemen. What else. Erm. So we walked down town then he took me to dinner, he paid... it was super nice. We talked about ourselves, then he drove me home and then he walked me to the front door and that was it... Yep that was it. Fucking snooze fest. So, nothing remotely interesting happened for your evening? Gosh I guess not. OK well I have to go. Bye I love you Jen. Love you too. Bye. God that woman! OK beautiful, please tell me you're gonna show me a better time than my best friend just had? Not a problem. Come here. That's the start of it (mid conversation chatter) OK guys we need to go. Not quite yet. Caitlyn has been avoiding questions about her date with Tony. Now, no more bull shit. Really Jenna? So Caitlyn are you gonna lock up that? What's up? Oh come on you guys. Ok fine, Caitlyn talk but make it quick? Oh my god you three are worse than the golden girls and Jenna I already told you everything that happened. I know more than that happened. Oh yeah, how do you know more than that happened? Because you're wearing more makeup today than usual. Girl that's highlight. Ooooo, Caitlyn, tell us about it. Erm... well... We kissed before we left the office. What!!!??? So girl you made the first move? I knew you had some slut in you. I don't believe this. Well it happened. I really like him guys. But I told him I wanted to take it slow and he understood so give me a break. OK girls, we need to make sure that everyone's aware of Caitlyn's virginity. That's my personal business. You girl it don't sounds like you're doing any business, you need to get your freak on. Come on you guys, Caitlyn, we're just screwing with you. Just because you're fucking half the town, doesn't mean the rest of of us have to follow Jenna. I mean what's it like to have sex without love? What's it like to know that in the end no one likes you for you, they like you for what's between between your legs! Well the rest of us do know miss princess. What's it like to be dumped by 3 guys because of your convictions. What's it gonna be like when Tony dumps you because you won't put out. Jenna stop it! That was harsh you know. And what she said wasn't? Yeah but she's not us Jenna, and she never will be so... why do you feel the need to rag her for it. She's OK man, she don't judge us. So why you feel the need to judge her? I wasn't judging her I just wanted to know how her date went. You need to apologise to her. Whore. You probably should give her some space. Oh really, so one date and suddenly you're her savior? She's my friend Tony. Exactly, which is why you need to give her some time. What? If you want to keep her as a friend you need to give her some space. How do you figure? Don't be stupid Jenna, you like to play like you are but you're not. I know this sounds cliche, but time heals things, so if you give it some time.... I'm sure it will be OK. Oh and by the way, don't worry about me going anywhere just because she won't have sex with me. I'm patient, and if it takes a while, it takes a while. So just leave it alone. That's fantastic to hear is there anything else I can do to help you with your account today? Alrighty well thank you so much for calling Valvery financial call center have a great day. Thank you for calling Valvery call center how may I help you today? Wow mother fucker! Ain't you supposed to knock or something? Are you... You think you can fuck with me? Eh? You think you can fuck with me, tease me and walk away like that? Remember, nobody's going to believe the you being the fucking girl whore that you are. Are you OK Tash? Not really. What happened? Judas cornered me in the file room. He what? What the hell, Tash, we need to tell Angie. No, no no, please no. Nobody else was there, can we just leave it. What? Well, Tasha... we need to report this. Just leave it be, please. just leave it. OK. OK. OK. I won't tell anybody. You promise? I promise OK? And her? You don't see me and her talking like this.

Nobody's gonna believe that whore. No witnesses, no problem for me Yeah mother fucker, you touch any of my friends and you'll wish you'd never been fucking born. - You hear me you stupid bitch? - Yeah. That was amazing. Jenna. Oh my god. Hey you OK? Caitlyn? Slow down. Girl slow your legs down. Can you please move? We didn't do anything to you. So what's up with that? Yeah come on Caitlyn it wasn't us that said anything. We covered for your ass girl. What? We stuck up for you. We bitched Jenna out for screwing with you. Wow thanks I guess. You guess? That's all you gotta say? I guess? Tash don't go crazy. Look. We have been friends for a very long time. You and Jenna need to put this past you guys. Word... Yeah but what about what Jenna said to me? I'm sure she knows it but, we're going out tomorrow night. So how about we pick you up at nine and we bring Jenna with us? And that way she has to make up with you. Come on Caitlyn, please? OK. I love you guys. Ohhhh girl! OK well I have to go. Hey it's Tony. Hey Tony what's up? Do you dance? Yeah why? OK I'll pick you up in an hour. Wait Tony. Don't peep. Watch your step. We're almost there. Patience is not my strongest Tony. OK well you're gonna have to learn! Walking and stop... OK don't open your eyes. OK on my count. Open your eyes. 1, 2, 3... Did you do all this? Do you like it? I love it oh my God. Come on. How's your coffee daddy? Best cup of coffee I've had in a long time. Kind of like dinner. What's bothering you? Oh Jen and I just got into a fight earlier. Really? About what? Nothing important? Erm yeah I see it all over your face. Come on talk to me tell me what's going on. It's just... She said some really harsh things and I don't think forgiveness is an option. Forgiveness is always an option. You guys have been friends since like the when you were the height of a grasshopper. So you can always forgive. Yeah but she's NEVER talked to me like this before. You know you guys have had fights, over the years, and you've always got through it. This one will be no different. She's a real friend to you. You need to keep her close. Just remember, everybody's entitled to their own opinion. You might not like it, I might not like it, hell and them might not like it. But you know what? Everybody can change their mind too. No matter how old I get you will always be able to see right through me. I got abilities. I guess I have to talk with her. I think that would be great. OK. Are you kidding me? What? Why are we at Caitlyn's? I thought we were going out? Yeah we are but we gotta pick up our girlfriend. Your girl? This is bull shit. Really? Dude these shoes are not made for this. Dude. Come on. Are you serious Jenna? After the shit you two have been through you're gonna act like this? Like what? Like a dumb ass bitch! What did you call me? Yo you heard me! Our girl in there just wanted us to leave her to her shit. But you had to be a bitch and let it all out in the open. What's up with that? Well she started it. I'm not... Jesus Christ Jenna, grow the fuck up! OK? You need to get your ass in there. Apologize, make up and do whatever it is you two do, and let's go have a good time. I really fucking hate you guys. I really do. No you don't. OK, fine... Fuck, I know you guys are right. Let's just go in there and get her and go and have a good time. Thank you... Oh my god. Tasha stop pacing will you. This is my fault. What? This is my fault. I should have let you report that scum bag at work. Tasha. We don't know if it was him. It could have been anybody Shit. What are you talking about? Tell me god dammit what the fuck are you talking about? Judas cornered Tasha in the filing room. What? I wanted to turn him in but Tasha didn't think anybody would believe her. Tasha you know who did this? Mr, we can't be sure who did this. Liz why don't you take Tash down to the police station at get a report. Please Liz. Alright. Mr Wild. Mr Wild? Yes? The doctor would like to see you just come this way please. Hi I'm doctor Danor Wine-Brennor. Please to meet you Mr Wild. And you must be Caitlyn's sister? Best friend. - Of course. - Jenna. - Mr Wild. - Danny, call me Danny. Danny, of course, your daughter has sustained some major head trauma due to the blows to the head. She has a severe concussion. Is she gonna be OK? We don't know. We spent some time stitching her up. She has some major vaginal trauma. Is she gonna be able to have kids? Yeah she will, she'll have to heal first of course, but our major concern now is the concussion. Is there any way to find out who did this to her? The police did their rape test, if they have DNA from the man, they'll be able to find him. Not always though. When can we see her? Unfortunately Jenna is it? Only Danny is able to see her at this time. It will be about a 2 hour wait before we can let you in. Maybe you can go downstairs and grab a bite to eat. I'll let you know when you're able to go in and see her. Thank you. Tasha slow down. Well walk faster! Tasha! We did what we had to do! Tash just.... Let me go, why have you got to go and fuck with me like that eh? Telling the cops that it might not have been him? Look I'm just trying to get it right. He grabbed me by the throat, how much more right you gotta be about that eh? You sound like you're fucking defending that scum bag! I am not! How could you accuse me of that! Then let the cops figure that shit. I'm done I'm fucking tired of taking you home. God dammit. Hey what's wrong? Oh shit, Tony I was gonna call you... When next week? Don't get shitty with me I've been at the hospital with her this whole time. Who? Caitlyn. Tony... Somebody broke into Caitlyn's house last night. She was beaten pretty badly. Tony... She was raped. Somebody just broke in and raped her. Erm... Can we go see her? She's in intensive care, the only person who can see her right now is her dad. OK erm... We should probably go to the hospital and comfort him. Like I said I've been with him most of the night. I just came here to tell you what happened and then I'm going right back. OK well let's go. - Hey. - Hey Len. Deena how are you? Doing well, very well how are you? Good. May I? Of course. I went to your office but you weren't in there. Yes my computer isn't working. Course, silly technology. I assume you're here to talk about our new patient? Caitlyn Wild, yeah. I would really like for you to come down and talk to her. I don't come to the rooms Deena you know that, I... prefer to have things in a bold and professional environment. I know Len, but I'm gonna need you to do it this time. - That's not how it works. - Len! Don't let me pull the seniority card. I need you to come down and talk to her. Please. This is why we got in this field, to help people. And this young lady, she needs your help. I'll expect you in 1 hour. She sure told you! You need to shut up. Door closes. Caitlyn? Caitlyn? What's that daddy? These are the pills your doctor prescribed. They're to help with your trauma and the PTSD. But we gotta take you and gotta get going because we got an appointment with Doctor Gregory. I don't wanna go daddy. Baby you have to. No. Yeah I can't keep making excuses for you. These appointments are so you can get better. So you can work through this. It doesn't help I don't wanna go. Caitlyn? We have to go. Can we go next week? No we need to go today we need to go to all these appointments. The more you go, the sooner you get better. Now I'll be right back. I got your shoes for you. I don't want to. Caitlyn don't make me pick you up and put you over my shoulder and carry you all the way to the doctor's office. Can I go next week? - Just say I'm sick, the medicine made me - No. Please. No we are not gonna have this discussion right now. You're gonna put these on and we're gonna go. Now. Can I take my teddy-bear? You can take your teddy-bear. OK. Do I have to go next week? Yes you'll have probably go to next weeks. Let's see where we get this week. Probably nowhere. That's all up to you. So what are we gonna talk about today? Caitlyn? You didn't want to talk in the hospital, you don't wanna talk now. What are we gonna talk about today Caitlyn. Why are you asking me? Caitlyn you just need to relax a little bit. Caitlyn can you please look at me? We talk about the same damn thing, every time. This isn't helping me. I hate being here. I hate it that nothing is working. Did you pick up the prescription? Yes. Did you take one? Before I left. Well it takes a bit to get into your system. Keep taking them and let's give it a couple of days OK? Whatever. So how have you been sleeping? Same. Not well? Same. Same means the same, it doesn't mean better or worse it means the same! So what is with the anger? Something happen at home? Caitlyn? - Caitlyn!!! - What??? What are you feeling right now? Like I don't want to be here. Why is that? Because you're pissing me off. Really? You fucking bitch! Caitlyn! Caitlyn! Caitlyn... Nothing's working. Why isn't anything working. Caitlyn you haven't been out of the hospital that long, it's gonna take some time. God that's all I keep hearing, that it's gonna take time, that it's gonna be fine. But nothing is working! Caitlyn do you have a ride? Where was he. What did you say Caitlyn? Where was he? We're supposed to take care of each other. That's all we've done for the past 13 years, and the one time I need him he was not... Mr Wild how are you? Hello Doctor Gregory, I don't know how much longer I can do this. I'm just having such a hard time. I've never offered this before but... what if we move the sessions to her house? What do you mean? Just what I said. What if we try doing the sessions at home. What good is that gonna do? It might help to be somewhere more familiar. Somewhere she might feel a little bit calmer. At this point doctor, I'm willing to try anything. Anything. OK how about I meet you there tomorrow afternoon. Yeah, that's fine. I'll meet you there tomorrow at 1. OK sounds good, thank you. Goodbye. Good God Len! What are you thinking. I know this is wrong, I know this is wrong! So we going upstairs? Not tonight. Come on. We always fuck after we eat. I said not tonight. Cut me some slack. Alright. Kiss me then. I'm sorry... I'm just not in the mood tonight. This whole thing with my friend has me fucked up. What about me? Are you fucking kidding me? What a selfish prick. No, oh my god, stop, STOP IT!!! Who the FUCK do you think you are!!! What am I some kind of blow up doll? Your own personal hooker? Well sweet, when you act like a fucking whore, you get treated like one. Get the fuck out of my car. God damn fucker!!! Ahhhhhh!!!! I hate you!!! I hate you!!! Why!!! Caitlyn? Caitlyn? Wake up Caitlyn. Nooooo!!! Wake up! No, No!!! Oh my God. Oh god, Danny get out of the way. Caitlyn! Caitlyn! Oh my god. You're alright. Caitlyn! Look at me! Caitlyn! Look at me. Caitlyn! You're alright. Look at me. You're alright. Just breathe. You're OK. It was just a dream, you're OK. Danny would you get me a wash cloth? With warm water on it please? Yeah. OK Caitlyn, are you ready to talk a little but about what just happened? Do I have to? I think this would be a good time to don't you? Can I have my teddy-bear? Sure. OK so you're still having nightmares. Yes. How often? Whenever I go to sleep. Go to bed at night, or take naps during the day. - Every time? - Every time. How much of the nightmares are you remember Caitlyn? Some nights it's, it's not like how it happened. I managed to get a hold of a screw-driver, or a knife, I just, I stab him, and then I stab him again. My hands and arms are covered in blood. And so is my clothes, soaked. I drown in it and... then I wake up. And where are you? In this dream, where it's happening. Behind the couch. Where it happened. When do you usually wake up? Well... it depends because there's two different ways that I dream about it. It's the one I just told you. And then it's how it actually happened. The beating, him grabbing me by the door, calling me back, punching me. Kicking me, I always wake up first before he gets my skirt off. OK you're doing great sweetie. Anything else that you remember is important Caitlyn? No. Is the medication helping you at all? No OK erm, I think that's enough for one day today. You did really good honey. I'm gonna write you a new prescription and I'll have your dad pick it up. This will help you with some of the anxiety. And I'm gonna have you not take the other stuff OK? OK. We're gonna do one a day. And I'll pray this will help a little bit with that alright? You did really good today Caitlyn. Really good. Have you looked at those brochures that I left you yet? No. What about the book? I started but then I couldn't get through the first paragraph. I'm not the only one that does the work here Caitlyn, you've gotta help too. So, try and look at those will you OK? Give them a read. Here's your prescription for your dad, I'll tell him to come pick it up, alright? Do you feel like this is better today being here at the house? I don't know. OK well give it another try alright? OK good job sweetie. Can you lock the door on your way out? You bet. Mr Keyword. Mr Judas Keyword? What the hell do you want? I think you know. I don't have any idea what the fuck you're talking about. Sure. How about Tasha Lambling. File room at work? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I think you do. I didn't do shit. Why don't you just tell us how it went down? Feeling a little frustrated? Maybe some energy you needed to take out? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. We can run your ass down town right now for assault. But I'd rather you come clean, and tell me about what happened. That way I can book you for rape, and an intent to kill. Kill who! How about Caitlyn Wild? That tight ass bitch from work? Dude I wouldn't fucking touch her with your dick man. I don't have any idea what you're talking about. I've got an alibi, I was getting a tattoo, you can check with true blood. You can check it out. Mr I don't want your phone, I just want you to tell me what happened. - Come on! How did you... - I didn't do shit. Yeah. Cuff him. We'll go down town. Hands behind your back. Man I didn't fucking do shit. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have a right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, we will point one for you. Whatever. - You understand these rights? - I know my fucking rights. Yeah, yes. OK I'll tell him. Bye. OK so... her dad said we should be ok to go inside. What's up with you. Tony. If you're gonna be like this I can't let you go inside. I'm OK. I just don't know how to act. Just act like yourself. Do I have to spell it out for you? What if I want to hold her? I don't think that's gonna happen today. OK well, what's up with you? What do you mean? This whole Martha Stewart thing you got going on. What's up with that. Nothing. I just needed a change. That's drastic. Mind your own business. You should be focused on getting your mind ready for when we go inside. She's gonna need us to be as much like ourselves as possible. It's the only way we can help her. OK. Hey Jen, hey Tony. Hey. Hey Tash. Ok... so, why don't you start out here and kinda get your mind together. Caitlyn's gonna need us to be as normal as possible. We'll go inside. Get a feel for the room and let you know... how it goes. Alright? I'll wait out here then. Alright. Ready? Let's do this. Why did you do that? It's nice outside. So... Caitlyn, Tash is outside, she'd like to see you. Why? Why? Yeah why!? What's the reason, the purpose, Do I need to go on? Caitlyn. WHAT TONY, WHAT!!! Where are you going? To make some coffee? Take him with you. Seriously? I don't want to be alone with him. I'm 5 feet away Caitlyn. No need to, I'll be out in the car. - Tony? - Just don't talk to me. OK. Don't look at me like that. Do I need to explain to you what happened? No... I just wasn't expecting it. Maybe I should go. And Take him home? And come back later? He loves you Caitlyn. He loves you so much that he talks about killing the person who did this to you Caitlyn. It's sweet. And scary at the same time. This didn't just happen to you Caitlyn. It happened to all of us. I'll be with you in a moment. OK. Hi there, I'm sorry please sit. Thank you. So Mr... Danny, Danny Wild. Are you new here? I don't think I've seen you around before. I just started day before yesterday, I was transferred in from Nevada. Nice, how you liking Colorado? It seems OK. I miss my kids, they're all grown up and out of the house so... I moved here and I'm kinda getting a new start. So Mr Wild what can I do for you? Danny, please call me Danny. OK Danny. What can I do for you today. I need a loan. What type of loan? Gail, can we talk? Of course, let me get the forms. No, no, no, I mean, person to person? Yeah, we can talk. Can I get you some water? No thank you I'm fine. Well, it's just... my daughter, she was raped a few weeks ago. Oh my God, I'm so sorry, is she OK? I mean, I don't know what I mean. She's suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. And it's putting a lot of stress on our relationship. I just don't know how much more I can take. What do you need Danny? I don't know, a medical loan? What's the loan for? She might need more than just the help she's getting now... We might need to put her in a place that may give her more help. Is that bad? We'll see what we can do for you Danny. OK so let me chat with my boss and I will try make this work for you. Thank you so much. Danny? Yes Gail? Danny would you like to have dinner with me some time? That's not a no Danny! I could tell that's not a no. You're right, that's not a no. Daddy please help me. I fell off my bike. Caitlyn? It's dad. Hey baby girl I got your new prescription. Why don't you have a seat? I'll get you some water. Can you do that? Yeah. So... one a day with food and water. Thank you for staying and having lunch with me dad. Of course baby girl. How you feeling. Better. Not as anxious, relaxed. Good I'm glad to hear. Yep. So I wanna tell you I was at the bank the other day. Talking to one of the loan officers, Gail, and we were er... Gail? Did it get that personal? What? It was a woman? And you got on a first name basis with a woman from a bank. Yeah so? Well... Tell me about her. Gail... Well obviously you know her name. But she heard about what happened to you. And? And I told her that you're doing better, and then we got on the subject of theater. She asked me out to a play next week. Really? Wow, lucky her. But I turned her down. Why? Because I need to be looking after to Caitlyn. I think I'm a big girl and I can take care of myself. And I'm still your father and I need to be watching out for you. What did you tell her? You'll reschedule, go on another date in the future? I told her that we needed to postpone it. She understood. Which means a lot that she actually understood. Yeah. Sounds like you're on your way. Wish I could say the same about me, but... You'll get there baby girl. So what's the loan for? So I've been talking to Doctor Gregory. And... it's for... - In case. - In case what? The home visits aren't going well with the doctor. And we need to get you some extra help to get you better. So where am I going are you sending me to a fucking looney bin? Caitlyn it's just in case. What the fuck, are you fucking crazy? According to you, I am. You don't just get to walk out on me, lock me up like some animal, when you can't handle me anymore, I'm your fucking daughter! Do I get to talk about this? You get to lock the door on your way out. This is Gail. Hello? Hi. Who is this? yeah, erm... hi Gail. It's Danny. Hey Danny how are you? I thought you weren't interested in me. Well I thought about it, and I thought about it, and I changed my mind. I'd really love to take you to dinner tomorrow night. I would love that. So erm... how about you text me your address, and I'll pick you up, say about 7? That'll be fine. I'll see you then. - Bye. - Goodbye. I love you Marilyn, I always will. But it's time that I move on. So I asked him to leave. Why what did he do? He's a man, I don't really wanna be around men. What was his reaction. He was hurt. I didn't care though. Why did you not care? Because I can hardly stand to be around anyone that is not my dad. So let me ask you again. Why didn't you care? I just feel like shit. It doesn't help he's been showing up in my nightmares either. Really? Do we need to talk to the police? I already told you I never saw the perpetrator. Why haven't you told me about this before? You never brought it up before. How often does this happen? It depends. Some nights it's just like how it happened. How often is this happening? It depends. Some nights it's just like how it happened. Other nights it's faces of people I know. Like Tony. And some nights I don't see anything. Some nights I just feel it. Well. This is gonna be ongoing for some time. Meds will help with this a little bit but, this is part of the course right now. How don't sugar coat it doc! I'm sorry if I sounded crass Caitlyn, I don't mean to sound that way. I'm just saying this is a common factor in most rape cases. What about my dad and looney bin? I'm sorry Caitlyn I don't know what you're talking about. Don't play Coy with me. Caitlyn you have me at a loss. My dad went to the bank, in case our in-house therapy sessions don't work. Your father is concerned that the insurance won't cover all of your medical needs. I also feel that you might be a better fit for being moved to a facility where... You're sick. We will help move you along a little bit. You're such a fucking liar. You're trying to take my dad from me, he's all I have left. That's not the case at all. I just feel you will benefit from some additional counseling sessions... GET OUT OF MY HOUSE! Get out of my house right now! Dam it, DAM IT!!! 1 pill every 12 hours Fuck it. Who is it? Who is it? Don't run from me Caitlyn. You're pissing me off. What did I ever do to you? Worse for you. You need a fucking peach for hours. If you leave I promise I won't tell anyone. Who you gonna tell Caitlyn. Who you gonna tell? No one's gonna believe you. Get off me. Don't you love me? Get away from me Where are you going Shhh if you be nice to me Caitlyn we can play for days. Why don't you just love me Caitlyn? Your bitches should have been nicer to me Caitlyn. Don't you wanna take this slow Caitlyn? All I wanted was a part of her man. Why don't you love me!? But your bitches acting like... So we found absolutely nothing. There is no sign of the struggle, there's no sign of the break in, there's just nothing. I mean we checked the whole place out. There's no foot prints, no finger prints, no hair, there's just nothing. But... what it does look like, an O.D. This is the medication, shrinks give it to their patients who experience anxiety, along with loss of balance or coordination, light headiness, confusion, comes also hallucinations, she's lucky she's not dead, I mean she took two of those things. And the prescriptions pretty new, and I took a count so... She's pretty lucky, and she's gonna be OK.
