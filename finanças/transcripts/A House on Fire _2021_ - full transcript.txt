(Crickets chirping) (♪♪) (♪♪) (Fire crackling) Help! (Siren & horn blaring) Somebody help me! Help! Help! (♪♪) (Siren & horn blaring) (Siren) Ahhh!! Ahhh! Ahhh! Dr. Sturgeon, what do you want to do? (Monitor beeping) Jim! Ahhh! Grab his left arm! Prep 600mg ketamine IM now! I'm gonna get you to lie down. Where is that ketamine?! (Grunting) Give me the syringe! Ah! (Moaning) (♪♪) (Monitor beeping) (♪♪) Way to think on your feet, Deb. Thanks! The adrenaline, it got to me. Listen, next time maybe just give me a second. You froze. We're here for the patients, Jim, not the other way around. Yeah. And I really need you to track down those lab results. We should have had those an hour ago. Absolutely. And can you move Mrs. Miller into examination room b? Mike. You know, one week left in emergency medicine, you might want to make a move. What? I don't know what you're talking about. She's really intense, but smart, focused, a lot like you. No, she is so out of my league. Yes, she is. But fortune favors the bold, buddy. Okay. Okay, you're good. Do you want to go grab a coffee? Oh, I'm still working on this one. Thanks. Yeah. (♪♪) You're welcome. (Sigh) (♪♪) I can't believe you scrapbook. You're like a 12-year-old stuck inside the mind of a medical genius. You should have to study like the rest of us peons. I study and I scrapbook. Oh, let's have a look see. Well, it's a good looking future, Deb. It could be a lot of work with just you and the kids. Might be nice to have a man around. Well, obviously, I’m gonna need one of those. Or sperm, anyway. Whose sperm is the better question. Right. What about coffee boy? Who? He gave you 600mgs of ketamine this morning. The coffee guy was asking me out? Yes. Deb, that is what flirting sounds like. So, his name is Mike, and he is the you of his class. Top scores, wants to get into cardiology. Hmm. Oh yeah, that's a real owie. But you are brave, just like the superhero, right? Okay, well we'll get you back to saving the planet in no time. You trust me, right? Good. I'll be right back. Mike Farrar, right? Yes, Dr. Green. What grade of sprain was it? Uh, it's, it's a grade one right wrist sprain. And how did you come to your diagnosis? I observed swelling, bruising, loss of motion and pain, and I ordered an X-ray, which came back negative, and so I'm recommending 24 hours of elevation, ice therapies and anti-inflammatories as needed. Good! Thank you. Yes, by the way. Yes, yes to what? I will have that cup of coffee with you. I mean, call me. (♪♪) Hey! Hi! (♪♪) So, I was thinking we would do the long circuit. It's about six miles, a lot of hills. You up for it? Yes. (♪♪) (Heavy breathing) So, you do track in college, or you're just really into running? You're not afraid of a little challenge, right? Apparently not. (♪♪) Oh, so... so hard. How did I do? Oh! Best. Oh, I don't know if I should drink this, or frame it. I would drink it. Yeah. So maybe I can pick the next date? Was this a date? (Laughs) You know, a lot of men are not comfortable with strong, intelligent women. I'm not a lot of men. So, where do you see yourself in 10 years, Mike Farrar? Wow, right into it. Mm-hmm. Um, I think just typical post-residency life. I kind of feel, like, vacations in Paris, skiing in vail, silver Porsche in my three car garage. Yeah, that's nice. For me, I'm thinking, like, married, kids. A really nice life. I know I'd be a great dad, too, so that's, that's too soon, that is too soon. You can pick the next date. So, this was a date. Yeah, it was a date. (♪♪) She was a genius. She was charming and confident. (♪♪) She's brilliant. She's just brilliant. (♪♪) I, I was married to her for 17 years, and I loved her. (♪♪) Debra: For a long time, my perfect life was all about me. Until I realized that it was incomplete. It was missing something. Or more importantly, it was missing someone. Dr. Mike Farrar, I know we're going to love each other forever, because you are my missing piece in my scrapbook and in my life. Debra, you captivated me the moment I first looked into those eyes. I love you, Deb! I love you, too! I do! I do! (♪♪) I now pronounce you man and wife. (♪♪) (Clapping and cheering) (♪♪) (♪♪) Hi. Hi. The house looked beautiful today. Our house, mm-hmm. (♪♪) (♪♪) (Alarm clock buzzing) (♪♪) Hey mom. Good morning, baby. Tim, don't forget your game tonight. I thought you were coming to my recital. Why would she watch that one when she could see this? Hey-hey-hey, not in the house! But nice swing though. Recital is at 4:00 and the game is at 5:30, so I'm gonna do both. Getting after it. Busy wife, happy life. Yup. There you go. There you go. Good morning. Good morning. Hi baby. Now let's see. You understand you're not under arrest and are freely speaking with us without a lawyer present. Are you with the police or the fire department? The fire department is still at your home. I'm detective rod Smith. This is detective Greg Burnetta. They're very professional people, the firemen. Ma'am, we'd like to ask you a few questions to help us get a better understanding of the events that led up to last night. We'd like to start with some background regarding your family and your husband. (♪♪) Ma'am, do you understand what I'm asking you? Thank you for the, um, egg whites again. Yeah, well, I got to get these curves off. Curves? You look fantastic. Keep it up and I'll show you something fantastic. Ew, mom! Honey, go get your bag for school. (Sigh) You stressed, Deb? Very. My younger self had something called free time. I hear that. You know, I used to think I was the hare and now I'm the tortoise. Actually, I'm not even sure I'm in the race anymore. Yeah, I, I got a busy day, too. Is Norma here? No, she called, apparently it's a flat tire this time. Do you mind waiting, I got to go? No, but no. Norma, the laundry's down here! Be sure when you pick up the kids you bring Kelly's permission slip. Ow! Oh, dang it. (♪♪) Patient has a history of recurrent infections, that include cellulitis, pneumonias and upper respiratory tract infections. Sorry everyone. He's been treated intermittently with methotrexate. On physical exam, patient is found to be febrile at 102°. Does he show signs of a past splenomegaly? Deb, you just arrived. Actually, he does. Oh, have you tried prednisone? No, not yet. Oh. Let's adjourn for now. I'll see you all next Monday. I'm sorry, my nanny was late, and so I couldn't leave my kids until... Debra, it's okay. Well, while we're here, I was wondering, um, has the practice given any thought to my? You still haven't passed your latest boards. I know, I will. Little behind. Yeah, we've noticed. I'm sorry, we're just not ready to offer you full partnership in the group. Okay, I just assumed after the trial period I would... Deb, you are a smart doctor clearly, but you're behind in cases. You're consistently late. Your bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. There's more to this job than, than natural intellect. Do you understand? Yeah. (♪♪) You want me to take a look at that? I can evaluate my own wrist, Jim. Yes. But you can't prescribe yourself anything for the pain. Bend it forward. Mm. Back. Mmm. It doesn't appear to be broken. How long has it been swollen? Six hours. No, I'm fine, seriously. Of course you are. But if it flares up again, you may appreciate this. It's a weeks' worth just in case. Thank you. You're welcome. Mike, can I get a sec? For you, Joe, I got a whole minute. I want you at the conference in Baltimore. You're kidding. Mm-hmm, you've been doing great work, and the truth is, I'd like to be stamping my time cards full time at the country club pretty soon. So, I want you to start stepping up on things like this. You good with that? Yes, sir, I'm your man. Good. (♪♪) Tim: Mom, what's for dinner? I'm starving. I could die! Spaghetti and meatballs. But, homework first. (Sigh) (Water running) (♪♪) (♪♪) (School bell ringing) (♪♪) Hey, Alexa. Jenny, you were amazing at recital last week. Congratulations, young lady. Hi Michelle, see you at mom's lunch. See you there. Yeah. Hey mom. Hi guys. How was it? Good. Good. Want to grab a snack? Yeah. yeah. Alright. Tim: That sounds like a great idea. (♪♪) Maybe we can stop on our way home. Great! Dad, where's Baltimore? Mm, Baltimore's in Maryland. It's the home of Johns Hopkins, a prestigious teaching hospital. So, how long are you gonna be gone? It's three days. You, you'll be good, yeah? Ah, yeah, sure. And why do you have to go? I have to go because Dr. Barry is sending me in his place because he is thinking of retiring soon, and is grooming me to be the next head of cardiology. So, sport, I got to make the time. Wow! Mike, is that for real? Yeah. Honey, that's great. Dad, that is, like, so cool. Yeah. You're gonna be the boss. Yeah. Can we buy a Porsche? Maybe, maybe when your mother makes partner. I'm gonna go find the camera. Okay, this is exciting, but enough about me. I want to hear about your days. Tim, why don't you start? Well, we had a pop quiz in math, which I aced, obviously. You know, Mrs. Winter said if I keep going like this, I could qualify for algebra two. Excellent, nice work. How about you? Nothing that interesting. I lost my ring today. Okay, everybody. Okay. Smile, big cheese. Cheese. Cheese. I can't believe it's all finally happening for us. We should celebrate. Maybe go on a vacation. Where do you want to go? I was thinking Japan, because Kelly's taking those Japanese lessons, so it'd be a really great way for her to have an immersion experience. Mike, I'm happy for you, I really am. What happened to your wrist, Deb? It's all swollen. Oh, I slipped a few days ago. It's nothing, stupid really. A few days ago, why didn't you say anything? I didn't want to ruin your big day. Oh, I, um, I can give you some ibuprofen here. Yeah, see if that helps. Thanks hon. (♪♪) I mean don't get me wrong, I love my kids intensely, with all my heart. I just, I don't know, when I'm at work, sometimes I feel like the world is just a little out of reach. You should have seen me when I was younger. I had so much potential. I had such lofty dreams. (♪♪) Oh, hi Dr. Green. Hi. I'm glad I caught you. I didn't get that prescription for room 22b before you left. Oh yeah, right. It's 22b? Yes. Okay. Thank you. Can you not read that? Sixty grams tylox every six hours. Go! Were you under the influence of either drugs or alcohol this past evening? (♪♪) (Siren) (Shrieking) Dr. Green. (♪♪) I had a glass of wine after dinner. What time? Uh, 10:00, 10:30. Is that normal for you? Deb had a history of addiction. It was never just one. We all have our demons. I've had mine. But that's behind me now. I have another question for you. Did you start this fire? (♪♪) Yo handsome boys, too. So, I know how tough it can be juggling a, a strenuous job with a, an active home life. I was thinking about how we could improve your situation. I mean there are alternatives to working in the hospital. You could handle peer review from home, and there's also medicaid processing, and it would mean more time with your family. Uh, well, I would have to consider that. Well great! It's settled then. Okay. (♪♪) Oh, here, let me. I got it, I have it. I'm good. (♪♪) Almost done here. Doctor. Pam, how are we feeling today? Actually, I'm in a lot of pain. Is there anything you can do? Yes, of course. Here's what I'm gonna do, I’m gonna write you a prescription for dilaudid, and you will take one every 12 hours with food, okay. Want me to run that to the pharmacy for you? No, thank you, I can read my own writing. I'll take care of that right now, okay. I'm home! Tim: Mom, what's for dinner? Kelly: Mom, Tim took my pencils. Tim: Did not, she's lying. Kelly: Ow, stop it! Give them back! Tim, did you take my violin? Tim: No, why would I take your violin? Kelly: I don't know, you took my stickers last week. Tim: No, I didn't. Kelly: Then why were they missing? Tim: I don't know, ask mom, maybe she was scraping again. Kelly: Why would mom want... (♪♪) (Tim and Kelly continue arguing) How was work today? It was great, thank you for asking. Okay, so, how was everybody else's day? Kelly, you start tonight. Well, dad, Maryanne sat next to me today, and Robby, that's my friend from after school study, he tried to pass her a note. (Clink) Oopsies. You okay, hon? Mm-hmm, I'm fricking great! Well, he tried to pass her a note, but then I told him that she wasn't interested. So, she told you that? Yeah, she told me before that she wasn't interested in him, that she thought he was weird. Mike! Oh, what's up, Joe? Is everything okay with Deb? Why do you ask? It's a little sensitive. You can just spit it out, Joe. Some colleagues have noticed that she's been acting off, slurring her words, illegible handwriting. Is everything okay with Deb? Deb is a perfectionist. She's too much of a control freak. For, for what? Drugs? Thanks for asking though. (Door slams) (Footsteps) Deb? Hello? (♪♪) (♪♪) What are you doing?! Are you on drugs, Deb? What? Some of the doctors at the hospital think that you've been coming into work high. And you believe them? You're going through my things, Mike. I defended you, Deb. I'm, I'm only thinking about your career. Oh, since when have you ever been thinking about my career? Deb, we want the same things. Your scrapbook with the successful job and the big house and the nice family. We're so close to that. No, you are so close! I'm the one who has to manage things on the home front. I am the one who is in charge of the nanny. I'm the one who picks up people at school, at recital, at baseball practice. I do the homework. I... you know, I, I am happy for you Mike, I am, and I want you to be successful, but I want that for me, too. But if I have it, we have it. Deb, I think... Oh, come, don't even. Just a misunder- no, no, no, I just, I don't want to talk about this. Deb, I... (♪♪) Deb, look, I think... You know, I really don't want to talk about this right now. I know, but I need you to know I'm sorry. You know what? The school fundraiser is tonight, and I, for one, am going to enjoy it. And Janet and Kelly were fantastic together in recital last week. I taped it, and I think you and Mark should come over and watch it, and we can have dinner together. I'm glad I got them started early. I think she started playing when she was around eight. You know how it is, right? Is that Tim going on the Peru trip? Pardon me? This table is to raise money for the science class trip to Peru. Jordan is just obsessed with going. Yes, yes, yes, so is Tim. I'm Celeste, Jordan's mom. Michael Farrar. I fully recognize you from? We both work at kc memorial. I'm a psychiatrist there, and my husband, John, is an anesthesiologist. Dr. John Walker. Yeah. Is, is John here tonight? No, no, John doesn't make it to much of the school stuff. Ah. So, here I am, no date for the school dance. Well, well you seem, uh, I guess you must have a very good balance of your work and home life then? I think it looks easier from a distance. Yes, yes, I hear that. We struggle with that here and there. You know, everyone struggles. I'm sure that you've heard people talking about John. No, people, I haven't. It's okay, there's a stigma around mental health. Okay, I have heard that John took a little bit of time off for depression. Well, that's true. You know, we all go through rough patches, and we just have to look for strength from those that we love to help us through it. You know, I don't need an at home cheese tasting, but I should probably make a bid on this. Who doesn't need an at home cheese tasting? Let's take a look. Maybe I do need one, just hadn't thought of it yet. (Mike laughs) (♪♪) So, Deb, can we finally talk for a sec? Sure. I've really thought about what you said, and I want to help with your family workload. Well that's very nice, thank you. Yeah, I was talking to Celeste Walker tonight, that's Jordan's mom, her and John work at the hospital. John has some issues, so he's parttime. Okay. Well, she's got some really great ideas about work and home life balance. Her and Jordan are even going on this trip to Peru. How nice for them. Yeah, and she's really got it together, and she's got these tips she gave me about good home workouts, and there's a salon she goes to, it's right near the hospital, so you could go there. If you want a haircut so badly, you should go. (Door slams) (♪♪) Deb, what are you doing? You don't like how I look, I won't bother. (♪♪) Jordan is ecstatic about Peru. You guys are coming, right? It's not really the right time. Is John going? Things are not, not great. Now, I know medically that depression is a disease, but how am I supposed to feel like a good wife when he's so unhappy he thinks about killing himself? Sorry, that's, that's too much. No. I get it. I used to be so entranced by Deb's intensity. It's just different now. It's anger and tears one moment, and then it's insomnia and anxiety the next. I don't know. I do this for a living, and it's more common than you think, especially in our profession, in people with high iqs. What do you think Deb has? Well, has she ever talked about being bipolar? I, I don't know her well enough to make a real diagnosis, but maybe she should see a professional. You could go together. Maybe. Just know that I'm there for you, if you need me. Celeste, she's a whore. What else do you need to know? And where were you at approximately 10:30 last night? I was in the hospital. Were you with anyone? Dr. Celeste Walker. She's a friend. A friend? Why don't you tell us a little bit more about your friend, Dr. Walker? She helped me realize something that had been true inside me for a very long time. What's that? That I wasn't in love with my wife. Who is she? She is the hospital's legal counsel. And why is she here? We're suspending your hospital privileges indefinitely. Effective next week, you'll no longer be able to practice medicine here. But I'm a good doctor. But you still haven't passed your boards. I haven't had time. The hospital won't extend your privileges any longer until you pass. Good luck, Deb. (♪♪) Deb? Yeah. Everything okay? Yeah, I'm just getting something for a patient. Okay. (♪♪) (♪♪) (Sobbing) (♪♪) (♪♪) (Ripping) (♪♪) I knew she was troubled. Troubled? It was mood swings, anxiety, depression. But I also looked the other way 'cause she was a good mother, I knew that, I knew that. I thought I did. (♪♪) I'm not perfect, but I can tell you one thing, I loved my children, I loved them so much, and I'm a good mother. Everything I have done in my entire life ever was for those kids. Mom, I, I don't get this cosine function, can you help? Yeah. It's the link of the adjacent side divided by the length of the hypotonus. Do you know where the Pythagorean theorem originated? The Pythagoras of samos, born 570 bc. It was actually known for another theorem that he originally... Mom, mom, I, I think I got it. Hon, can I get a ride in with you this morning? Yeah, sure. Oh, thank you so much. (Car doors slamming) Oh, forgot my purse. Oh, I'll get it for you. No, I got it. I'll see you inside. Okay, see you inside. (♪♪) (♪♪) I'm sorry, Mr. Sudermann. This will not happen again. Hi mom. What happened? I shoved Charlie Harwick. He wasn't listening to me, and I just, I got so mad, and he was on the ground, I'm sorry. Where are you going? To bust your sister out of school, too. Wait in the car. Hey, Mike, how are you doing? You know. Yeah. Well, I'm sure you guys will come out of this. A lot of doctors have a setback or two. Deb's tough. What are you talking about? Deb's suspension. I'm sure it's been rough on the whole family. (♪♪) If you had a spirit animal, what would it be? A deer. Why a deer? I don't know, just I see them everywhere and. Alright, that's fair. What about you? If I had not broken you out of school today, what subject would you be in right now? I'd be missing Spanish probably, or math. Tim? I'd be in gym, getting these pythons built up, yeah. Oh, my, okay, alright. (♪♪) (♪♪) (Clattering) (♪♪) (♪♪) (♪♪) Oh! Thought you were supposed to be good at baseball. Oh, oh, am I supposed to be good? Okay, ready for this? Okay, yeah. Up. Sorry. (♪♪) What's wrong? Oh, nothing's wrong, Sonny, I'm fine. You... you look sad. I had a bad day, too. Come here you, get in here. Oh, oh, I love you so much. Now don't tell your dad, we weren't supposed to get out. All right, listen, it's not my favorite, it's not, it's not awesome, it's not... Mike, what's happening? Kids, go to your rooms. Dad, what are you doing? This is between your mother and me. I mean, she, she had a bad day at work. Go to your room now!! (Clatter) Do you have any idea how this looks? They were for my wrist. They were for the pain for my wrist. Really? Because I don't see your name on half of these prescriptions. I'm not an addict. What if the hospital found out, Deb? You'd be arrested, I’d probably lose my license, then where would we be? You're lying. You're on drugs. You're awake half the night! You got suspended and didn't even tell me! I don't even know who I'm married to anymore. I'm still me. (Huff) I know you are, I do, and I know how much pressure you're under. Have you considered that you might have an actual mental health problem? Did someone at work tell you that? Did she? 'Cause I'm not crazy! I'm not crazy! You're not crazy or an addict, which is it?! (♪♪) Are you leaving me? Oh, Mike, please don't give up on this family, please don't. We need a fresh start. We can have that, I, we can, I know we can. And no more drugs. No, no more drugs. What else? We always had a 10 year plan, and one of us was gonna retire early if we could afford it, focus on the kids. I know it's a little bit earlier than we planned, but with this promotion, we do have the money, and the kids would be so happy to have you around and. Well, then that's what I'll be. I'll be a great mom. (♪♪) Okay. (♪♪) (♪♪) (Toilet flushing) It's true, she stopped using drugs. But believing that was the end of it, that was the biggest mistake I ever made. (♪♪) What's wrong? If dad leaves, will you stay with me? I thought everything was better with you and dad. (♪♪) (♪♪) Wow! Crêpe au beurre sale caramel et crème Chantilly et pommes sauté. Bacon. French toast. Crepes. Thanks mom. Yeah. Yeah, thanks mom. Okay, Deb, kids, I have a little surprise for you today. What is it? (♪♪) Hello, the Farrar family. Hello. Oh, honey. Wow! Dad, this place is sick! So, the foyer, okay, is all Italian marble from carrara. Fireplaces are imported from Tuscany. Deb: Wow! Is that an intercom? Yeah, yeah, there's one in every room, even the kids' rooms upstairs. No way! You guys have such a beautiful family. I can see why you'd be interested in Canterbury court. It's a type of estate where you all belong. Kelly on intercom: It's, like, ah, it's spacious. So cool! I'm coming upstairs. Honey, I love it! I do, too. Let's take a look. Okay. Kitchen? Yeah. Yeah. Hey Carol, it's Deb. Oh, hi Deb. Is Mike there? Um, he's just in a meeting with another doctor. Oh, wow! Do you want me to grab him, or leave a message? No, no thanks, just tell him I called. So, how was the tour? I still cannot believe the Johnson's are selling. Did you know that Wes and Nancy went to the quarry in Italy to pick out their marble? It's nice, it's really nice. The truth is, I'm worried to make such a big commitment... To Deb. She still won't see anybody. I just, I don't want to pull the trigger, it's such a big house, when my marriage is not on solid ground. Well... I'm sure you'll make the right decision. (♪♪) (Door slams) So, we were talking back at the house about possession date. Okay, we're still thinking the 30th? What's going on? We're drawing up the offer, just like we talked about. We said that we were gonna talk about it later. I'll just, I'll see myself out. Thank you. What, what was that? I'm not ready. You're not ready? We said that we would discuss this later. You don't want a fresh start. You don't want a fresh start at all. You just want to watch me grovel. Deb, that other house has carrara marble. You don't think that's a little bit much? How dare you, how dare you embarrass me in front of my children! Your chi-, what? You see this? This is stupid, right. Calm down! Mom, mom. Deb, please. Your father hates me and he thinks I'm fat and ugly! Deb, I didn't say that, I never would. This was our life. This was supposed to be my dream! Mom don't! Deb, please, please stop, Deb. Honey. (♪♪) (♪♪) Were the kids close with their dad? The kids hated Mike, especially Tim. Do you have any idea what that's like, to have your own kid look back at you like that? Tim couldn't stand me, and then... (♪♪) (♪♪) Mom? (♪♪) I'll stay with you. Kelly: Tim, let go of that! Tim, Kelly, you better be ready. We are leaving in one minute. Kelly: Yeah, well, so am I. I've been reading this for the past month. (Phone ringing) Hello. Phone: I have Hank Stapleton for Dr. Michael Farrar. Oh, I'm sorry, he's not home right now. Can I take a message? Phone: Oh, I must have confused the numbers. I'll call his office. Have a good day. You too. (♪♪) (♪♪) Mom, are you ready? Yes. Here you go. You know what I think we should do tonight? I think we should go out. Cool, can we have pizza? No, burgers. Both. Sweet, all right. Wait for me in the car, okay? Okay. (♪♪) Intercom: Dr. Farrar, please call extension 201. Dr. Farrar, extension 201. Oh, my apologies, I'll be right back. Hello, this is Dr. Farrar. (♪♪) Sir, sir, you can't come in here! This is my house! Is anyone inside? No, the place is empty. Oh, thank god. What happened? Looks like the fire was started by an old radiator. We'll know more in a few hours. Dad, dad, dad! Oh, you guys, you guys! You're really lucky your family wasn't in the house. It could have been much worse. I got ya. I love you both so much. (♪♪) (♪♪) Yeah, yeah, thank you for the quick estimate. Let's just leave that there for tonight. They okay? Yeah, ah, they're okay. I read them one of my crime novels. They fell asleep pretty quickly. Are you okay? That was our home. That was where we got married. That's where the kids took their first steps. We are safe and we're together. Because I don't know what would happen if I lost you guys. I don't know what would happen if I lost my family! I truly cannot imagine. Oh, Deb, maybe there's a silver lining. What? Let's do it. Let's buy that house. Mike, are you sure? I do love you. I love you, too. I love you. I love you, too. Mm-hmm. (♪♪) Yeah. Yeah. (♪♪) Well, what do you think? Oh, it's heaven. We've got a little piece of heaven. Yeah, it's a heck of a house. Just like your scrapbook. Mike, it's just the two of us now, right? Yeah. It's just us. Kelly, that was fantastic. No, that was better than fantastic, that was spectacular! Dad, be serious. I am. When you played amazing grace, it was just... It was just a practice. I know, but you were so good. Mom's gonna be so happy. Yeah? Yeah, I hate it when she's sad. What does that mean? You know, when she's quiet, wants to be alone. Yeah. But, mom's gonna be better now, now that her scrapbook life is real. Yeah. (♪♪) Hey, Benny, I found the lighter. What are you doing? Good. That's not how you do it. You wet the rag first. (♪♪) (Siren) Oh shit, run! Was Tim usually in trouble? That was nothing. Boys will be boys. He was caught making a Molotov cocktail. He had learned about them in history class that week. Look, children react when a home is in turmoil. Their father was trying to tear our family apart. Did Tim know where you kept the accelerants in the house? Accelerants? Lighter fluid, gasoline, kitchen lighters, that sort of thing. No, no, no. But you do keep those things on the property, right? Do you think Tim started this fire? (♪♪) Was it possible? (♪♪) I have failed as a husband, and I have failed as a father, but there is one thing I know and that is that Tim is not capable of this. (♪♪) Tim's weirdly quiet when I got home. No, he was just tired from playing with gunny. You know, actually I'm pretty tired, too. You know, it was really great watching Kelly practice. Don't you want to try and do that more? Mm-hmm, that would be nice. (Sigh) Oh, hey, I said I was tired. (Huff) Kelly says that you're really quiet a lot lately, and you spend a lot of time in bed. (♪♪) You know you can talk to me, right, Deb? I still don't need to see a psychiatrist if that is what you were getting at. (Huff) Hi Carol. When's Mike back? Let me check for you. I was a bit of a b-i-t-c, you know what, last night, so I brought a makeup lunch. Um, you know what? He's already out for lunch. With Joe? No, no. Um, I don't know when he'll be back in either. Oh. (♪♪) Are you having regrets? Only about buying that house. Look, we didn't know this was gonna happen. I know. (♪♪) But we got to tell her. I'll tell her. Mike, like, I, I can't tell John, not yet. He's too fragile, right. Yeah. And Deb's gonna be furious, but she's also a very smart woman, and I think that she's gonna see that somehow this is better for everyone. (♪♪) (Sobbing) (♪♪) (♪♪) Irst? Aren't you supposed to cook the meatballs? Hi kids. What's going on? We're making dinner. Where's your mom? Oh, she's taking a nap. Right. Dad, she's just sleeping. Deb! Debra! Oh Jesus, Deb. Deb, Deb, Deb, Deb. Oh. Okay, okay, okay. Deb, get up. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Oh, look at you. Deb, you with me? I can't believe that you would do this in front of our kids. You need help and I can't wait anymore. We're gonna call a psychiatrist, make an appointment now! What do you care? You don't even see us anymore. I care, Deb, I care. You promised me, Mike. What? You said it was just us. Do you have any idea what I have sacrificed? Do you have any idea what I have done to keep this family together? (♪♪) Did you start that fire, Deb? Deb! Dad, leave her alone, she needs rest. Oh, Deb, no, no, I can't do this anymore, Deb. Get out then. What did you say to me? I said leave! You are not my dad! You are just some asshole ruining this family! Tim, you go to your room right now! (Thump) (♪♪) Come here, come here. Deb. Just leave. (♪♪) Okay, okay, it's okay, it's okay, I've got you. I've got you. Deb was always trying to manipulate the kids, especially Tim. She has no friends, only the kids. She would tell them things that children shouldn't know. So, you were at odds with your entire family? What? No. But certainly Tim had a reason to lash out at you. No, no. How do you not understand this? It wasn't Tim, it was Deb, Deb! Deb turned those kids against me! Deb made them hate me! Tim hated his father because he was failing his family. He didn't love us anymore. We were just in the way. (♪♪) Sorry to ask you this at such a difficult time. But we're gonna need your clothes, as well as a sample of your hair. Fine, whatever. Dr. Farrar, we're gonna need your clothes and a hair sample. From me? Why? Divorce, are you serious? Debra, you'll get through this. Well, he's not getting my house, if it comes to that. Okay, you may have to sell the house. No! Think of it as a fresh start for the both of you. Well, he's not taking my children. I want sole legal and physical custody. We can try for that. The court supports that. There is a precedent for the mother getting custody. That's true but. He's having an affair! He doesn't even want this family. And what, if anything, does Mike have to use against you? (♪♪) I don't think we should let last week's nastiness define us as a family. So, why doesn't everyone tell me how their days were? Tim, you can go first. Okay, buddy, that's fine. Better rehearsal today, Kelly? How'd the violin go? Just leave her alone. I get leftovers tonight? You don't like fried chicken. (♪♪) (Vomiting) (♪♪) (♪♪) (♪♪) (Phone ringing) (Knocking) It's your kids' school. Mom, mom! Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. Got everyone home. Oh, I shouldn't be like this. I still love you. It's gonna be okay, I promise. You are such a good boy. Promise me you'll never leave me. I won't. Your father has a girlfriend. He's in love, and he's cheating on me and everybody knows it. (Door slamming) Debra! Debra, Debra! Dad, dad, it's okay, we got a ride home. There he is, father of the year! Deb. Dad, leave her alone. Tim, please stay out of my way right now. Deb, you don't get to say that to me. You stranded the kids at school. You didn't pick them up! Where were you? Were you off with your whore? Deb, no, please, not in front of the kids. Dad, we all know! You are such a bastard! Deb, I feel bad. Can we please talk in private? You'd like to talk? Why don't we talk about all the people you're screwing? Why don't we talk about them? Deb, let's just take this down. Oh, okay. Police, open up! You're the morality police. I'm not, I'm not fighting with you. We got a call. Is everything okay? No. Who are you to tell me what to do? Policeman: Are those your parents? Kelly: Yeah. I'm talking to you! Officers, thank you for coming. My name is Dr. Michael farrar. My wife is drunk, she's possibly on drugs. She needs to be taken to the hospital and put on a 72 hour psychiatric hold! (Arguing) Not my son! How could you do this to her? No, I don't want to go! I don't want to go anywhere! No, no, no, no, no! Let's go! No, I don't, I don't, I don't want to go! Do you know why you're here? Yeah, I'm here because my husband told the police I'm suicidal, which I'm not. I think you can agree. He's such a son of a bitch! He forced me to stop practicing medicine before I was ready, and now the, you know, just I'm not gonna lose my family. Relationships have many acts. We need to recognize this as we move from one to the next. And which act is this, intermission? You know, at one point I thought we were gonna have the perfect life. And what does that look like to you? You know, just good kids and the big job and the fancy house. And what was it like when you sensed you were moving closer to that life? It was heaven, just a little piece of heaven. And how does it feel when you're moving farther away from it? It's dark. It's overwhelming. Is that when you feel you need to take a pill or have a glass of wine, to combat the darkness? Don't treat me like an addict. If we want to address your underlying problems, you need to get sober first. I mean, I am a 41-year-old woman with two kids. A few months ago I suffered a grade two sprain on my wrist, and I was over prescribed opioids. My privileges were revoked, and my husband started having an affair with another one of the moms at my kid's school, so it possible I’m just having a bad year? I have an IQ of 163. Do you have any idea what that's like? I'm running when everybody else is walking, or I'm walking when everybody else is running. I don't understand what just happened to being gifted. Clearly, you are a very smart woman. Can't you see yourself medicating? Isn't it possible there's something underlying all of this? No one will ever know what it's like to be you, Debra, but look at it from my perspective. You are irritable, distracted, anxious, sleeping all day, feeling depressed, and then you're borderline suicidal. I'm not crazy. Mental health is a stigma. Oh, Jesus. But it is an illness just like any other disease of the body. You diagnose and you treat. Let me ask you in this way, if I asked you to get sober and gave you something that would help you get back to your kids, would you take it? I would do anything for my kids. (♪♪) (Applause) Oh, come on, kel. (♪ Amazing grace ♪) (♪ Amazing grace ♪) Mom. Mom. Hi, come here. Oh, I missed you so much! Kelly, how was your recital? It was amazing. You should have seen me. Yeah, that good, huh? Yeah, it really was. Are you feeling better? Yes. Okay guys, let's eat. Pizza's for you. Tim, you have the burger. Mike, spaghetti with your favorite sauce. I don't. Join us, come on. Thanks Deb. So, would you like to ask the question? Sure. Kids, what was your favorite moment of the day? Kelly? Mom coming home. Yeah, welcome home, mom. Oh, I love you so much. (♪♪) Thanks. For what? For this, you didn't have to. No, don't, don't, don't. What? Don't act like everything's okay. This was good, but it's not, it's not working, and it's not okay for the kids. Okay, kids need their parents, Mike. They're always gonna have us. But you and I are not good together, and I think you... Can see that we're gonna need a divorce, we're gonna need... Oh, my gosh! Tim, call 9-1-1! Okay, I got you. (♪♪) Thank you, Jim. I, I just want to know what the medical protocols are. Got him on fluids and a full spectrum antibiotic. We'll know more when we get the bloodwork. Thanks. Anything you need. Is dad gonna be okay? Um, if he's feeling well enough, could you put him on, please? Hi, sorry you don't feel well. I know you've been under a lot of stress here, so. And when you get back here, we'll, we'll sort it out, okay. (Click) (♪♪) These are castor beans. And? Castor beans contain ricin. A highly potent toxin, a poison. In the hands of someone intelligent enough to know how to use them. And your husband was hospitalized recently. Mm. (♪♪) Good night, baby girl. Sweet dreams. (Knocking) Hey. I'm gonna go see your dad in the hospital. You go to sleep. Okay. Okay. I love you. Love you, too. (♪♪) Deb. Maybe I should... Yes, I think you should go. (♪♪) Just give us a couple of minutes. (♪♪) I brought some soup. (♪♪) I'll just... (♪♪) No. Mike, I would do anything to keep this family together. (♪♪) Mike, Mike, look at me. Mike, I will lose weight. I will get that job. I will be a better mom. I will be a better wife. I will be anything you'd, I will be everything you need. Deb, just... Mike, think about the kids. I am. (♪♪) Are you gonna let that woman tear our family apart? So you need a shiny new thing to go with your shiny new house? Stop it, stop it, Deb. You are a bastard. Stop it! You are spineless and you are a terrible father, and you were everything I said that you were and you... Yeah, that's it! Blame me! Blame everybody else! Deb, you think that you are what, a brilliant doctor?! You think that you were a great mom?! I know who you are. You're manipulative, you are erratic, you are a liar, and you care about one thing, you care about your status, and you care about that because if everyone saw who you actually are, they would be disgusted! I think that you are actually crazy. (♪♪) And that's why when I get the divorce, I am gonna take the kids. (♪♪) You will take those kids over cold dead bodies. (♪♪) (♪♪) (♪♪) (♪♪) (Rattling) (♪♪) (♪♪) (♪♪) (Ripping) (♪♪) (Ripping) (♪♪) (♪♪) (♪♪) (Fire crackling) (♪♪) (Fire crackling) Mom, can you hear me? Mom, are you there? Mom, please, I'm scared! (♪♪) Mom, mom, I really need you right now! Mom! Tim. Mom, mom, there's a fire! Mom! Gonna wake up Kelly? We have to get out! No, honey, wait right there! I'm going to get help. You just wait right there, okay. Okay. Hurry mom! (♪ Amazing grace ♪) Help! Help! (Siren & horn blaring) Somebody help me! Help! Help! (♪♪) (Sirens & horn blaring) Ahhh!! (♪ Amazing grace ♪) (♪ Amazing grace ♪) No, no! Tim! Kelly! Tim! No, no, this is my house! This is my house! Are there children in there? Kelly! (♪ Amazing grace ♪) No, please! (♪ Amazing grace ♪) Deb, where are the kids? Where are the kids, Deb? (♪ Amazing grace ♪) Oh, come, what did you do? Deb, what did you do?! (♪ Amazing grace ♪) (Fire crackling) ( Deb: I watched from the front yard. There wasn't anything else I could do. There wasn't much anyone else could do but watch, as it all turned to ash. Thank you for recounting all this. I know it's difficult. Now that we're caught up, could you walk us through the events this past evening after you returned home from the hospital? Yes. I went to bed around 11 o'clock, and I was awakened by the alarm. I went to turn it off at first, but I found the hallway filling with smoke. So, I went to call 9-1-1 and that's when I heard Tim on the intercom. Tim used to be my 13-year-old son. Tim was calling you on the intercom? He sounded scared. He asked me what to do, and if he should wake up Kelly. I said, "no, stay there, I'm going to get help," which was probably the kiss of death. Ma'am, we haven't told you that your son or daughter has passed away yet. I'm sure if Tim or Kelly were alive, we would know by now. Mrs. Green. It's Dr. Green. As I mentioned before, I stopped practicing at the coercion of my husband. But now that we're getting a divorce, I think I'm going to go back into practice again. This time into psychiatry. Dr. Green, you've had some time to think. So, I'd like to reiterate our earlier question. Did you start this fire? I loved those children more than life itself. (♪♪) I think we're done here. Then you're free to leave. I do have a request. Yes. I would like to see my husband. I want to be the one to tell him our children are dead. (♪♪) Your daughter, it appears she died from smoke inhalation. It would have been peaceful. And Tim? (♪♪) Your wife, she was adamant about telling you what happened to the kids. Why would she want that? The previous fire at our old house, when it happened, one of my colleagues suggested that maybe Deb started it, and at the time I just thought, "well that's absurd." But the thing about Deb, she's smarter than everyone else. She's brilliant, she's just brilliant. (♪♪) (Knocking) (Knocking) (♪♪) I didn't have anywhere else to go. (♪♪) Mike, I... Say something. (♪♪) You should have been home where you belonged. (♪♪) (♪♪) There you go, Deb. Where do you see yourself in 10 years? (Door slams) (♪♪) (Crying) Deb: Despite all those years I sacrificed for my family, I'm left with no one. And so, I enter this last act of my life alone. I received two concurrent 40 year prison sentences, which I'm currently serving, but I'm innocent. After all, I loved my children. I would do anything for them. (♪♪) (♪♪) (♪♪) (♪♪)
