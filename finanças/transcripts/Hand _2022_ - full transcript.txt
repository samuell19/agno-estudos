Naruhodo ne Being held in my father's arms was the first memory I had. Hey... Are you okay Miki? I'm so done... Sawako 20 years old So done... This is from the customer next to you. Thanks... Thanks for the drink... Sorry... Your uncle is like your Dad right? How old is your Dad? My parents had me late so he's already 55 years old... 55 huh? I've always been treated like a little girl but... Then one day, the way that people treated me changed. Was it ever since I took off my uniform? Or was it the older men that changed around me? There are many children who can't stand having an older Dad. You have a daughter as old as me right? All men are like this outside. Then your facade at home is a lie? I'm using it properly! I'm really stressed out. Just take half of my stress and get the hell outta here! I'm getting blamed on this side! It's true. Wanna accompany me? Accompany me! Just come over here... Have you done it recently? You just toys anyways right? -They broke! -Oh my... It might not work as good as a toy but... How about I give you a little play thing? I don't need a play thing! Hey, what will you do? Stop going after young girls! Young girls are the best.. Don't force yourself okay? I want to touch someone young... Geez, you're such a pervert! Hey, what's going on? Hey... Is this the true face of the world? In order to live in this world you have to live with these kind of older men? If that's the case then I need to learn how to live with them too. I'm sexy? Hey sexy! You know, when this season started Saito started acting really sick. Well... I hope he'll get cured today. Here! Thanks! I saw baseball live for the first time! It was the best! Thank you! It's fine. You don't have to try and eat so much. Well... It might be age-related but... I want you to feel like you are with your friends. Eating with someone is more enjoyable for me as well. Yes! These older men teach me an unknown side of the world. There are some wonderful older men as well. Why are older men so interested in younger women? That person is probably great in his company. I'm sure that he isn't loved at home. He probably likes fashion. I'm sure he doesn't care about his smell. I'm sure that something good happened and he is going to reward himself today. He's drinking canned beer alone. Sawako 25 years old Te It's time honey! See you later! See you later! Torai-san. Yes? Please finish it by the end of the day. Okay~ You gotta do your best okay? Okay~ Yes? Nothing... Take a look at this. Okay. Is this okay like this? Hmm, needs some work... Arikawa-san. Yes? We're not going to make it in time with this. That's true... We're gonna be in trouble with this... Yes? You were late again today huh? Yes... And you got in a lot of trouble today huh? I did... But I'm not worried about it. I'm doing a lot of work here. He's our manager but he rarely does work business with you huh? How do I say this? He just gives me wordly wisdom. And I just say "Yummy". So you're going to work overtime today too? Yep... I see... I still have some stuff left too... Then we're in it together huh? Hooray! Alright! Happy old man collection He's got some nice fingers huh? Nice and vertical. He has a lot of lines on his fingers huh? And finger hair. His head is pretty cute too. He should show it more. But trying to hide it is cute too. Your beloved Yusuke-kun is going to end up like this too. Don't lump them together! I've been going on dates with this guy recently. Yusuke-kun... Is going to become a painter. And so... I'm wishing that my piano playing went somewhere too... Hey... Have you ever had anything special? Not really. You don't want it? I'm afraid of their parents... It's best not to expect too much. And so... All a girl has to do is play along with what the man wants. You have to start there first! Really? I'm not sure... Look at this chubby guy. How did he end up like that? Have you ever dated anyone other than older men? I have when I was about your age. Really? Really? Yep! How was he like? He was in the same class as me. Let me see! You can't! I just came! Did it all come out? It all came out...oh crap! More is coming out! Hold on! Hold on! Damn it... Sawako give me a tissue please! A tissue! Tissue! Here! Hold on... Oh crap! Look at this! Amazing! Hold on! Oh crap... I came a lot... Hold on... Hold on that hurts! Ouch! -Does it hurt? -It tickles a shit ton! Oh crap, it really tickles! It's coming out more... Oh crap! Hold on... They said that this will make a girl feel really good. My friend told me to do it with a man. Shall we go now? Hey, you bought some new ones! It was in my Dad's room. Your parents are still doing it? Why? That tickles! It's salty! Hey, are you listening? What was it? Like I said... Do you think Dad and Mom are still doing sexual stuff? No, I don't think they are! Really? Is it yummy? It's average. I thought that if I laughed, maybe you would too. Anyone would laugh normally! I had a job interview today. You know the other day when your Mom caught you secretly reading Mitsuharu Kaneko's book, right? Yes... And so I tried making a scenario where my Dad was reading my little brother's book in secret. Sorry! You have a pretty good memory huh? There's a lot of jealous rivals around here... Are you quitting this job? Wanna come with me? That doesn't make sense. Wanna come with me? I don't have that type of physical strength or commitment to work. This is on me! In other words, I'm no longer going to be your colleague. Umm..well... Uh... Want to get some drinks? If you like... Are you okay? I'm okay! Bears don't sell if they have even the slightest of injuries in their internal organs. But if the owner is a hunter like him then he can just get the best meat himself. That's why you can always eat fresh and tasty bear meat in this place. This place is number one in Japan! Amazing! You're always saying such flattering things! It came! What is this again? A large beetle. Please eat this large beetle! This takes some courage huh? I wanted to bring you here at least once. How about we take a commemorative photo of you two? A picture!? Your phone! Your phone! Alright, let's see.... Alright! Umm... How about I take it? Of me? The two of you! Go ahead! I'm taking it! Here I go... Okay...cheese! Get a little closer! Here I go... Okay...cheese! Looks good! Really? That's right! I have some clean gallbladders left! It's a special day! Gallbladder? I'm looking forward to it! Gallbladder has been used to cure diseases since ancient times in Japan! It's great! Amazing... You are really cute Torai-san... You think so? Yeah.. This skirt looks really good on you. That scarf is nice too. And that short hair too... It looks really good on you... You've only complimented my appearance... Your thick calloused hands are really cute. Cute? Show me your modest side. In the back of my mind, I feel like everyone does what they want. That's cute too. Is that boldness something you acquire with age? Haha, I love that you are trying to hide it. I haven't asked them but... That one guy looks like he's having all the fun. A shoulder bag! And such a long cute strap! Everyone looks proud and like they rule the world. There's so many gaps. How does the world look like to you guys? Do you go across this world without knowing it? You two are still up? You ate Yakisoba? I'm home! Welcome home! Huh? Mom isn't here? I want to eat too! Dad, have you eaten? Not yet. Wanna eat? Maybe I should. I'll warm these up! Onee! Onee! Onee! Yusuke-kun confessed to me today! Oh my God! Amazing! But you know what? He's going to be going to a local university... And so I'm wondering if our relationship would go okay.... You should date him then think about it. But if we date and break up, I don't want things to be awkward... That's true... Look at this. This is the guy I dated when I was 21. He's still cheering me on even today. This happens too. Comparing us to something like that is pretty troublesome. Where did I have it? No way... Sorry for the suddenness. No, thank you for contacting me. It just happened so suddenly. We were hanging out just the other day too... I'm sure that Honda-san was very happy. That he was able to meet a cute girlfriend like old times. Did he call me his lover? Yeah. Is that so? Is everyone else living a proper life? You're an adult too huh Sawacchi? I'm already 25 years old... It's pretty bad! Young! Very young! You can do anything! A promising future! I don't have any dreams like always. It's far from promising. There you go again... I'm living a completely different life than before! That's how it is! You'll be okay too Sawacchi! Thanks! Uchino-san is the boyfriend who taught me that it's okay to leave it as it is. I'm glad that he's doing okay! Boyfriend huh? You don't have a girlfriend yet? I don't... Well, it was fun! I'm glad that you're spending your precious and youthful time with me! I'm really grateful! Thanks! That love hotel closed down huh? And the store next to it is in tatters! How nostalgic! That was the first time I was in a love hotel! After that... I wanted to visit love hotels often! Don't talk about ridiculous stories from the past! I can't get hard anymore! No way! But take a look at this! It'll get hard in 5 minutes! It's okay to rely on things when you need it. You don't need your pride at those times. Badass! Even though you can't get hard, you still go out like a badass! Tell me a story for 5 minutes! Are you living properly? That's not the case for me! I hope you are doing well! Don't worry about stupid things! Do what you have to do now! You run away fast Sawako. You might think it's lame to get serious. Shut up! You're always lecturing me. Lecturing huh? It's not a lecture! It's been a while since I felt that type of kindess from someone. Huh? Hold on... It's here! It finally came! It's really hard isn't it? That's some serious stuff! This is my house! That has to be a lie! No, it really is! -That has to be a lie! -It's being worked on! I got married! No way! It was last year! Really? Swipe more to the right. The right? Take a look. Take a look. What a suprise! Nice right? This is your... Amazing! Have you gotten bigger? You're lying... What? Do you have that intention? Not really. Me neither! Hold on.... Who is this? That's dirty! Hey... Hey, what has gotten into you? Shut up! Aw crap! Play with my nipples! Aw crap! I'm cumming! Touch me! Touch me! Oh crap! Hold on... Thanks... Look at this... I should contact home... No, she's already sleeping. You're not going to argue? The baby started kicking for the first time in my wife's stomach. My life is gonna come to an end. It's going to be a lot of fun huh? Hey Sawako... Fall in love! Become happy! I mean you're the first person I've dated. What are you doing? I'm going to move into my wife's parents house. For real? That's why... That's why this will be the first and last time doing this. Understood. It's over... Thanks! Do your best! You too! I mean it! Be happy! I don't want to have my life decided yet. I don't need love or a stable relationship yet. Come on... Good work! Good work! Here, good work! Strawberry is the best! Girls look the best that way. You should smile more Torai-san. Yes? Before you tell me to smile... You should smile first. I'll get some tea. Thank you... Does it look like you'll stay longer? It's over now. I'm leaving the company next week. I know. Of course you did. Umm... So... -Today let's... -After work.... Did they see you? It's fine if they see me. It's not an affair. No, umm... Why not hold hands and be interlocked? Here? I'm quitting the company. Omori-san! Which way? Sorry! Sorry! Your hand is surprisingly feminine. Nothing! That's good! It's really favorable. It has meaning to me. Meaning? Nothing! Me too! People like you have a meaning as well. What kind of meaning? It's nothing! Onee... I've started dating Yusuke-kun. Congrats! The two of us went to the library today. I couldn't concentrate at all and got no studying done. I will let you know if anything happens. He gave me some gifts. Want some? That's for you right? And he got me a strange strap. Where should I put it? Maybe on my bag? Your hands have stopped moving. Hey... It's been a while since you've spoken with Dad. Since when? I'm not at that age. He always ignores me. It's because of that person. Why ignore your daughter? Well...umm... Umm...thanks a lot... Umm... Manabe is... Stop fumbling around! I'm so happy that we're here together! I'll take what I learned here and do my best at my new job! Thank you so much! Umm...this is from everyone Omori-san! -For real? -Do your best at your new job! Thank you! Don't look at it! How about we give him a toast? Alright, good work Omori-san! Good work! Good work! Good work! Drink up! Can I get some chicken over here! You'll be lonely right? I won't! No, no! Why not? We speak a lot don't we? That's right! You've invited me out a lot! I saw that! You think so too right boss? You're saying that but you probably wanna go drinking too! I didn't say that! Please invite him out! But you know what? I never worried about that in this job. Hey, hey, hey! I can't even do that! What's your excuse? She's not gonna say! I won't! I won't! It went quite nicely! Please get in! No, no, no! You should get in! We'll take the next one! Wanna come in with us Torai-san? Get in! Get in! Go! Go! We'll take the next one! Thanks! Thanks! Later! Bye! Hmm...wasn't Torai-san living in Saitama? Really? Was that right? But that's fine! Let's go! I want to try kissing you from now on... What do you think? I think thats fine... Shall we go home? I'll take you! Sorry about that! We're off. Is there anything you want to eat tomorrow? Nothing in particular. If you don't want to, I'd like you to decline. We can go on the Seibu line. We talked about going to your house the other day. How about that? That's it!!! It was Nabe! Nabe! The lights are so bright... Hey, let go! How do you like it? Start with the outside first... Got it... You like it licked or played with? Tell me what makes you feel good! I like it played with. Got it. It makes me feel tingly. Sorry if I cum. We did it yesterday. Leave it alone. Progress, progress. You're fine with me? I'am... I like the wide world over a man's shoulders. It's a view that cannot be seen alone. I always thought about this. I can't imagine how remarkable this is. Cute... Did that feel good? Yeah... I was suprised... She likes a certain rhythm. Draw circles around it. Play with it. What is that? I'm gathering knowledge. Let's go ahead and have some good sex from now on. From now on? Yeah. I was nervous at first. We talked about good points. Mori-san played with me in the morning. It felt really good. Stop it! I like it there. It's receding. Don't say that! That's why I wear it like this. It's fine. It's not good! Well, when it happens I want to be proud of it. Well... Well, I'll take some medicine... And it will grow back I'm sure. I think it's fine. You'll become an old man. Then become a good old lady too. That doesn't feel like praise! Shall we go to work together? You already quit the company! Are you coming back? Later! Later! -Later! -Later! Sometimes I desperately want to see the person who is by my side. Good afternoon! Good afternoon! What? Don't move! I'm moving around! Don't move! What about an abstraction? Sorry but we still don't have the materials yet... Is that so? So then... We'll get it during the week. Understood. Please do. Torai-san? Torai-san! Yes? What's wrong? Nothing! Focus. Sorry... Let's start with the first thing. Stop. It's the boss! The boss! Oh crap! Oh crap! What should we do? You're crazy... It's because of you! Eww! Stand up properly! Isn't the meeting about to end? Oh crap! This is bad! What will we do if they see? No, I don't want them to see! I don't want them to hear your cute voice either. I like you... Don't stop... Every man will stop when they hear "I like you" for the first time. But I like that! 5..4...3...2... Hey, everyone is looking so glum! Even me? Your eyes are closed Dad! Dad! I can't keep my eyes open that long! Do your best! Why can't we get this right? Be in the spirit of celebration everyone! Give me a nice smile! Okay! 5... 4! 3! Put in this much! Grab that fan there! Yes! Not me! -Over here? -Yes, right there! That's right. I'll put this in afterwards. Afterwards is fine. Thanks. It's done! Alright, we got some time. It's almost done. It's been a while since we worked so hard. How about you clean it up? Fine, fine. Hey Sawa-chan... Isn't your Dad a little hard of hearing these days? You think so? Can you take him to the hospital? No, he's just ignoring me. And it would be better if you and Rika took him. Mom! Where is the big container? Geez! Onee! When I eat lunch, I'm going out. I'm thinking of going over to one of those places. Yusuke? Do you have any advice for your little sister? Don't expect anything good the first time around. How brutal... I'm glad I asked you! Looks yummy! It looks hella yummy Onee! It's not yummy. It's delicious! -Let's eat! -Not yet! It has to set properly first! Is that so? We're going in? The bed is huge! That's dangerous! Where!? Where are you Rika? What is this!? What kind of place is this? It's hella green! Even the plant is green! This is all green! They have a box! I want to live here! Amazing... Rika! What is this? Hmm? A microphone? Hold on! Hold on! Should I put it in on the count of 3? On the count of three... Ready? Ready..set... It's in... It's in... This is it? Oh crap... You okay Rika? Yusuke-kun! Yusuke-kun! What do we do? It feels good! What the? My little sister chose her university. We celebrated that as a family today. We're a family of 3 right? That's fine really... This is a serious conversation! Sorry! Sorry! I just wanted to feel your boobs. There's no deep meaning. This is how men's hands feel... So? You are a family of 3? What else? We're a family of 3... And that's it. That's mine. Hello? Onee? -Onee? -I'm having sex! You called her? -You're having sex? -Hold on! It feels really good! Wait...what? Hold on! Yusuke! My sister! Umm... We're having sex! Oh...Yusuke-kun? It feels great! Bye! Bye! Hello? She hung up! For real? Who was that? My little sister! Little sister? She's amazing! Hilarious! My little sister is totally different than me. She's loved by everyone. I wrote about my feelings towards you from before. Really? What? Wanna hear it? I won't listen! Well... Umm... I like your fingers brushing my hair with one hand. I like your arms when you drink beer with two hands. What is this? I like your eyes when you look away with a smile. That's all! I really didn't think I'd read it! It's kinda weird... Sorry! Thanks... It's not that cool. But it's really good. Doesn't that mean it's lame? I love lame. What? What? What? What? Can I lay down? I'm in trouble! And you? It feels good! Next time... Can I do it from the back? Yeah! After this! To be honest... Never mind. What is it? No, it's fine. Oh no... I'm weak to that. Well... On the day we first went out drinking... I was thinking of kissing you... But I was too nervous and couldn't do it... And then... I ended up kissing you at the farewell party. I thought it would have been a shame. And then I wrote that. What are you sorry for? I just felt bad about it. Now you've kissed me a bunch. We did it together. But... Men try to categorize the things they did. We shared everything. That kiss as well. And our relationship right now. It's collaborative huh? That's why... Just going home alone is rude. Thanks for this... Even though it's lame? It's a written piece of work. Stop it! To Koichi, congrats on turning 28! Let's be together forever! From Kaori. I know. These hands have lied. You want to hold hands when you're walking with a girl huh? Girl? Sea otters hold hands even when they are sleeping. Well, that's so they don't get swept by the tide. Let's go see the sea otter aquarium next time. Girls like aquariums right? Alright. You're cute. What about me is cute? You've got that youthfulness of a teenager. Also... You're girly... And anxious... Why are you laughing? I mean... Then just date a teenager! No... That's a little... That reason disregards my age. And above all, there is no necessity to me at all. I... Umm... Like you... But I'm an old man... So who cares if you are an old man! Are you not allowed to face a woman properly if you are an old man? Treating me like a little girl is rude okay? I think you are a wonderful woman Torai-san. I take back calling you a girl. Do you want to touch these boring things? They aren't boring! They are! It feels nostalgic... Alright! Cheese! What should we do? I want to eat something yummy! Yeah! Yeah! What should we do? What about some chicken? Got it! That... Doesn't have any meaning to it! It's just some artwork! Looking at it isn't fun right? There is no other deep meaning okay? I didn't want to show anybody it! Is that so? I heard that birds raise 5 eggs at once... That's why they wait for them to be born and warm them up. I won't see you anymore. You said that the way I have touched you has changed. I wish it would have went better... Sorry... Did you never love me? I loved you! Did you think we were dating? What did you think about me? I'm going to marry my girlfriend! I proposed to her! Will she forgive you? It's pretty clear. We haven't had sex either. I told her that I regretted it.... How many times do you think we've done it? You have nothing else to say? What? Anything else important about today? Happy birthday! Sorry! What a crappy birthday! Screw it all! Sorry! Do you think I'd still be happy? Can't you at least let me say happy birthday? Why? Well... The last date! I want to end this properly. Why? Because the time I spent with you was precious. The monk dropped the tofu he was holding and it fell apart. And so he collected all the pieces in a hurry and threw them together. That's a theory about the start of Kenchinjiru soup. Gouji-san... You got a mouthful of me after you kissed me huh? You think so? Well, we've gotten pretty close. You felt the one-sided aspect and closed the distance. You'll be suprised so be careful. Alright! You want to touch my breasts? Yeah... Pretty much... That feels nice... Your heart feels so lonely Torai-san... I don't feel lonely with you. What about you? How is it like with your Dad? My father thinks that I'm a boring woman with no fruition. He doesn't talk with me. You should get along with your Dad. I think your Dad is waiting for you to speak with him. I feel lonely when my daughter is not by my side. I'm sure your Dad feels the same way. You're talking about your daughter and fondling the chest of someone younger than her. And you are telling me to cherish my Dad. You are the worst. You're pretty harsh today. Well... I'm thinking of not meeting with you anymore. That's why this is the last date. Is that what this is? Congrats. Let's treasure this. You are a wonderful girl Torai-san. A little girl? I'm home. Sawa-chan, can't you go with your Dad? Hmm? I can't go to the hospital with him since I have work. He can go alone right? But aren't you worried about him? It's okay! He's not a kid! Mom told me to go with you! Shall I have Rika come with us? That will make her worry right? I can go to the hospital alone. Hey! The bus is here! Okay! Yeah, it's okay! It's just an ear infection. Yeah, if he feels bad he can just take some medicine and be fine. Yeah... About that... The hard of hearing part is old age. That's why we can't do anything about it. Old age. I'm not sure. Ask him. He's here! I'll call you later! Hey...hey! Not that way! Hey! This way! Will we go home by taxi? I'm not sick. How is it going at work? Are you doing well? Why are you asking that suddenly? I'm not good at talking with people so... I don't think I'm a good fit for them. No matter what you do, you can't get away from people right? That's why you shouldn't expect much from me! Anyone is like that up to 30 years old. They get nervous when talking to people. Everyone is like that. It's hard when you are young huh? That's why you'll be okay. You'll be fine with age. You're disregarding your daughter's problems because of her age. That's how older men are huh? Thank you! Sorry! Here! Right there. Okay! 300 yen please! Okay, 300 yen... Please put the change in there. There it is. Okay! -Okay! -Thank you! Dad... Cook again! Take me on a trip again! Go on a trip. I'll follow you. Thanks for waiting. Not at all! It's cold! That's true... Shall we go? Thanks for waiting! This is strawberry chocolate! Thank you... Chocolate banana! I didn't order it! It's on the house boyfriend! Is that okay? -It's fine! It's fine! -Thanks! Thank you! Be happy! Yes! Washing? Let me wash your back! Please do! Ow! Wash it properly! I am! -Really? Okay! -I'm washing it! Okay, okay... You're not going to do anything? Nope! -Is that so? -Yep! Hey, stop that! That's for girls. -I'm just rubbing them. -It's fine! -Wash me. -Okay! Geez! For real! Stop it! Just hurry up and wash me! -Here I go! -Okay! Hey... Hey... Stop it, you'll make it weird... I'm not doing anything. You are... Hold on...I mean it! Stop! The bubbles Mori-san! The bubbles! What are you doing? Hold on! It's cold! I'm going now! Sorry... You don't have to apologize. It was the 31st time huh? Where's the paper? I threw it away. Sorry... It was the 31st time. 31st time. I think it's a good fit for the end. Men old and young are delicate and straightforward. I wanted to see you become an old man... I'm really... I'm really sorry... Thanks... It was fun. Everything. We got along and it was fun... And you called out to me at work. I was really happy! We made a fuss together. We won't meet anymore though... I won't forget about this... Be happy okay? Are you crying because of guilt? Are you crying because we won't meet anymore? I wonder... Please don't cry for the second reason... That's too much... Not seeing you anymore is so sad! Liar... Sorry... Sorry... I'm glad that you were by my side... I'm glad that we were together. Thanks a lot! Sorry... The hands of a liar... I loved you... That's the truth. Dad! Why don't we go on a trip? Yeah. Really? I'll give you some money. Why? Don't act cool! Let's go! Take me Dad! Dad... Shall we go? Sawa-chan! I'll take you! How lame!
