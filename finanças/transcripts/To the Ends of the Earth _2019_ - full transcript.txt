Sorry I'm late! - Found us okay? - Yeah. We left early. - Yoko, your first lines... - Yeah? - ...are here - Sure. "Hello everyone." Attaching your mic. You're ready. "It's called Aydar Lake. Uzbekistan's largest..." "Actually, in the 1970s, during the Soviet era, "it was created by accident... ...like a huge puddle." "Even so, it's said that.." Okay, let's move the equipment there. Temur, you help too. "Hello everyone. I'm in Uzbekistan, in central Eurasia..." Put these on. They had a hole in them. Yeah. Oh, don't worry. I fixed it. You did? Any leaks, tell me. Not yet? One moment please. Okay? Yeah. Okay! Rolling. Ready, start. Hello everyone! I'm in the middle of the Eurasian continent, in the Republic of Uzbekistan! Look at this lake! It's called Aydar Lake. Uzbekistan's largest. Five times the size of Lake Biwa. Actually, in the 1970s, during the Soviet era, it was created by accident while drawing water for irrigation. You could say it's like a huge puddle! Even so, it's said that the "bramul", a strange fish measuring up to two meters long, lives here. Can you believe it? This is just a big puddle. Today, with the help of a local fisherman, I'm going to see if I can catch that mysterious fish! Look forward to it! Cut! So-so? Can't make out the surface much. Get her to move more? Yoko, could you move around a bit? Sure. Er... What should I do... Change position? Yeah. Let's try there. I'll go look. Now then, how about this one? No good. It's empty. I'll ask the fisherman. So, does that strange fish really live in this lake? They do. If we're lucky, we'll catch one. Lucky, huh? Luck's something I'm kind of lacking. Luck treats us all equally. Of course, you're right... How was that? Cut. Yeah. Can't use it. Okay, next point. Now then, how about this one? Nothing at all. Does that fish truly exist? Cut. What now? Temur, ask if today's no good. He can't say. Oh man. What do we do? He says the problem is that she's a woman. Too bad. That woman's our reporter. Shoot some scenery? May as well. Sasaki, tripod. Sure. - The little one. - Okay. Fish abhor a woman's scent. Huh. No kidding. He says if she goes fish will come. Really? Don't interpret that. I'm sorry he was so rude to you. He's old-fashioned. Not all Uzbeks are like him. I'm fine, really. Thank you. Sorry! Change of plans. We'll head into the city. I'm ready now. Hold on. They're arguing. "Don't suddenly turn up. You should've told me yesterday. I can't do it now." It just has to look tasty, not perfect. "That's not cooking." We'll pay double. Okay, we're on. It's okay! Please go in. - We can? - Yeah. We got permission. Alright. Temur, take this. I'm at a chaikhana in Samarkand. "Chaikhanas are what we'd call 'eateries' in Japan. "Their most famous dish is plov. I hear it's suited to Japanese tastes.." Yoko, plov's ready. "I can't wait." "I'm at a chaikhana in Samarkand. A chaikhana is what we'd call cheap eatery..." This rice is uncooked. Yeah? Looks edible though. It's uncooked. You can eat it. But not digest it. Really... Temur, get her to cook this longer. Sure. I'll try. Sorry. Will you do it? Or not? She's short on firewood. This is as good as it gets. That's no good. What do you say? Alright. Your mic. Okay here. Rolling. Let's go. Ready, start. Here it is! This is plov. It looks like fancy fried rice. I can't wait to dig in. I'll try the meat first. Delicious! So soft and juicy. Why's it so sweet? Is it the carrot? It's got raisins too! It resembles fried rice, but the flavor is more complex. Now, to try the rice.. It's exquisitely crunchy! Impossible to resist. Cut. - Thank you. - Thank you. "It's cooked. Please, eat it." The shoot's over. "It's very delicious. I know you'll like it." Tell her no. Let's share it. Have some. Thank you. Yum. It's great. Thank you. - "It's delicious." - "Thank you." Yoko? No thanks. I've tried it. Temur, left! We're leaving. Please get in. Thank you. And this. Thanks. Dinner? Don't mind me. You're sure? I'll go to that bazaar. Okay. We leave tomorrow at 8 a.m., so be in the lobby at 7:50. - Thank you. - Thank you. "Just got to my hotel." "Samarkand." "Is it night there?" "You'd better sleep." "I haven't!" "I'm fine." "Really? That’s amazing!" "You’re gonna be busy." "Yeah." "I'll stick at it a little longer." "Good night." "Siyob Bazaar..." Huh? "You asleep?" "You're asleep?" "You're sleeping?" Good. Okay. Get ready... "It's dangerous for a woman." Huh? Can't anyone ride it? "Underage girls can't ride it." No, she's an adult. It's her choice, so it's no problem. I'm ready. Shall we do it? B camera on. Let's do it. Okay, rolling. Here we go. Ready, start. Cut. B camera okay! You alright? This is too intense. One more time? Sure! Sorry, once more. Go for it! Right. Ready, start. Cut. Okay! Feel sick? Yeah, kinda... I'll go too next. Removing B camera. "You shouldn't force that child." Like I said, she's not a child. "She'll burst a blood vessel in her brain, and die." Die my ass. Let's do it. Hey. We're doing it. Your hair. Okay! This is too intense. Let me check B camera. Feel sick? Yeah. May I throw up? Sasaki, plastic bag. Oh, sorry... Oh boy... You okay? Here. Thank you. Can you report? Want a break? I can do it. I'm ready. Let's start with you getting off. Okay, rolling. Okay, here we Ready, start. Wow, that was an experience! It's less a fun-park ride than some kind of training device. I'm so glad I survived! Mind you, small fun parks like this are increasingly rare in Japan. They make lovely little journeys, without going far. So there you have it. My Uzbekistan fun park report! Cut. Yeah, that'll do. Okay. Pack up! I'll take your mic. He won't let her. She can't get on? No. No, huh... Now what? She could stay on land. I guess so. Can't we take a trap and do it ourselves? I don't know... Shall we? Would it work? Yoko could wait in the van. Yeah, tell her to wait. The fisherman's refusing to go. Today looks tricky. Iwao. How much is useable from the chaikhana and the fun park? About a minute and a half. Really... Nowhere near enough. For you. Temur, we can't use the boat? No. Even if we pay $100 more? - The problem is... For you. - Thanks. It's not the money, it's his mood. What the hell? Why's everybody here so inflexible? Hey, this is near our hotel. Afrasiab Museum. It's got a 7th-century fresco painting. Huh. This says it's very rare. Our viewers wouldn't care. Okay, how about Yoko doing a homestay with a family? No time to set it up. I guess so. Hey... How about me setting a goat free? A goat? What goat? There's a pet goat at a house. I found it last night. It's in such a sad state. It was probably taken away from its herd to provide milk. Now it's tied up there all day, all alone. She's... It could be a he. If I set that goat free in some grassy place, it'd be so happy. Would that make good TV? Huh. I like it. You do? Here! Look! Huh. Let's go and negotiate. Let's get the gear. It's okay. You stay. Yoko, here. - Thanks. - Sure. Success. We bought the goat, so we can do whatever. Really? Temur, can I go into its pen? Let me ask. "Go ahead, but be careful. The goat's temperamental." Wait a second. Mic. Thanks. Yoshioka, is this outfit okay? Huh? Yeah, yeah. Let's do it. Ready! Rolling. Ready, start. Is it male or female? Male. What's its name? He's called Okku. Okku... Okku... Hello. Can I call you Okoo? Okoo. You're a boy? So why are you tied up here all the time? You could've cut your rope and gotten out if you wanted to. Okoo. "Okku, goodbye. Thanks for everything." Okoo. Come on, Okoo. Alright. Okoo, you're free now. You can go. Go. Don't let humans catch you again. Bye now. Take care. Cut. Yeah. That'll work. It will? Okay then. Here. Thanks. I'll take that. What are you doing? This wasn't the deal! Don't be so mean! "The goat belongs to no one now, so we caught it." That's not right. "You got the footage you wanted. Isn't that enough?" What'll happen to Okoo? "He'll be eaten by wild dogs here." No one told me that. "This isn't your concern." Then what was the point? You want money, right? You can have it, so back off. "We didn't come here for money." "But if you're offering it, we'll take it." "Our customs aren't like yours." Let's go. Yoko, we got footage, so don't worry. Yeah. Can I have your mic? Okoo... What do you want? "Dear Ryo. I'm in Tashkent at last. "This country's capital. "It's a modern city, so I feel safe. "The food's good, and so is my health. "Don't worry about me. I’m quite cautious. "Are you eating properly? "Don't drink too much. "Also, stay away from dangerous places. "Promise me. "I'll send my schedule later. See you." Messaging someone? Family in Japan? No, my boyfriend in Tokyo. I don't talk with my family. What does your boyfriend do? His job? Yes. He's a firefighter, for Tokyo Bay. Fires at sea? Yes. No kidding. The sea... That's great. I'm envious. We have no sea here. Oh. Does the sea symbolize freedom? Huh? Well... I don't know... I hear it's a dangerous place. Nothing to do with freedom. Sorry. Strange question. It's fine. Yoko... When you go back to Japan, will you marry that sea fireman? Huh? Yes. That's what I want. Is it? I wish you happiness. Thank you. Sorry to bother you. Even if the sky falls And the earth falls to pieces I won't be afraid As long as you're with me When your warm hands Touch me My whole being trembles with the joy of being in love If you wanted me to, I'd go to the ends of the earth with you I'd cut my hair, abandon my home, and even my friends too I'd even betray my homeland I won't be afraid, if you're with me You're all that I need Nothing else matters Even this life of mine It's Sasaki. Yoko, were you napping? Well... No need to open the door. Sorry. It's almost time for our meeting. Sorry, I'm coming. Er, it's okay if you don't come. I'll tell them you're not feeling well. Okay. Got anything to eat or drink? Yeah. Need clothes washed? I do. Wait right there. This. Got it. Hey... Yoko, were you singing? Huh? No. You weren't? I heard singing. It sounded like you. It wasn't me. Sorry. Okay, have a good rest. 'Morning. Good morning. Sorry about last night. Huh? What about it? Missing the meeting. Oh, forget it. Want to join me? Okay, thanks. What's wrong? Homesick? No. Boyfriend dumped you? Nothing like that. It's just... Nothing seems to go right. Like what? Work and stuff. Oh. Had enough of this job? No. I still think it's worth doing. Even so... How can I put it... I feel like I'm moving... ...away from what I really want to do. Which is what? Singing. Huh. Being a singer? Right. Music, huh. Then you’re not moving away from it. Singing or reporting to an audience aren't much different. I feel different. Reporting needs reflexes, but singing needs emotion, from the bottom of your heart. I see. When I go back, I've got an audition. Yeah? How I do will determine the rest of my life. What's it for? A musical. What'll you sing? "Hymne à l'amour." Oh. How does that go? Sing the intro. No. I can't sing it. It doesn't feel right. Oh. Now I don't even know... ...how I'm supposed to feel. Well, for now, get this job out of the way. Forget the rest. It'll be over before you know it. Okay. Back in the day, I wanted to make documentaries. I got stuck making variety shows, and considered quitting. Now I make killer docs every day. I enjoy shooting you. Sing for me sometime. I will. Why refuse now? Why'd they change their mind? Does everybody's word mean nothing here? I don't know why either. You told them we'd come? Yes. They've got a bramul? Yes. Why can't we shoot it? Like I said, I don't know why. It doesn't exist, does it? It exists. You've seen one? No. Now what? This is a disaster. What's this country's problem? My career's in the toilet. Screw this. Hey, how about Aydar Lake one more time? There's no time. Extend our stay? Impossible. I haven't got any plans after this. Even so, I want to think about what we can do in this city. Forget the fish. There's the Navoi Theater. Navoi Theater? I was hoping you'd get a chance to shoot there. Yeah? Why? Because, it's a place that means a lot to me. In what way? Once you enter, and go deeper inside, you'll find six waiting rooms on the first three floors. On the left from the first floor up is Fergana, Samarkand, and Termez. On the right is Tashkent, Bukhara, and Khiva. They're decorated in each regional style, from the walls to the ceiling, all over. They're very special. Everything was made by the hands of Japanese. Huh. They were soldiers who were captured at the end of World War II. First they were sent to Siberia, and then Tashkent. Transferred here as labor. These men worked very hard. They adhered to the instructions of their Uzbek bosses, plastering the walls, then placing patterned stencils. Using these as their guides, they carved the plaster intricately with knives. You can imagine how surprised the Uzbeks and Russians were. These men had been enemy combatants. Now they were captives no longer free. They didn't know if they would ever return home, or worse, whether they would see the next day. Despite that, they were able to devote themselves to the service of their enemy. I admire the Japanese people. Your perseverance, your devotion to others, and mostly, your kindness, resonated deeply with me. After learning about these former soldiers, I wanted to learn more about Japan. I thought I might be able to do something for Japanese. I wanted to make a career of it. I found my direction in life. What I'm saying is, the Navoi Theater made me what I am today. Huh. Nice story. Yeah, but it won't make good TV. Shall we go check it out? No. Our viewers wouldn't care. Yoko could do a report. No point. Yoko wouldn't know how. I think I went there yesterday. You did? There's a big fountain out front? Right. I did go there. You go inside, and there's a spacious hall. Beyond that... ...are several beautiful fairytale-like rooms. And there, I... It was like a dream. Sounds good. I get it, but it's not right for our show. Yoshioka, at this rate we'll have nothing left to shoot. Money's riding on this. Damn right. I wouldn't be here if I wasn't getting paid. I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry too. Um, okay, shall we go? - Yoko. - Yes? Want your own camera? Me? Yeah. Shoot whatever you like. I've lost my mojo. Huh? It'll be fun. Cameras change your outlook. Alright then. Use this. Hello everyone! I'm at Tashkent's largest bazaar, the Chorsu Bazaar! Look around. People, people, people! You can buy anything. Meat, veggies, sundries, smartphones, and art. It's like Tokyo's Ameyoko, Tsukiji, and Akihabara in one place. Today, I'll use this little camera to report from inside. Hope I get something good! Okay then, let's go! Wish me luck. This is the vegetable corner. I see herbs... That person's slicing something. Tomatoes and cucumbers... Oh! This must be the fruit corner. Are these black cherries? They look delicious. Now, next up, we're entering the bazaar's dome. There's a row of meat shops. Wow. What could this meat be? Mutton maybe? Whoa! An extravagant display of meat. The whole place is buzzing. This must be the horse meat corner. Let's look for something unusual. It seems there's a second floor. What's up there? I'll try to find a way up to the second floor. Cut. No good. Let's go over there. Yeah. Sasaki, go get Yoko. There are so many colorful dresses. All of them lovely. A feast for the eyes! Yes, there sure are a lot of lovely dresses here. Now, what's beyond here? A cat! There's a cat. I'll chase it! This way? There you are. This way? Huh? What a shame. I've lost it. It might be dangerous here, but I'll keep shooting. That looks like a dead end. I'll go up and see what's there. Temur? "What were you shooting?" The bazaar. Anything that caught my eye. "Where's your camera now?" I threw it away. "You were shooting in a prohibited area. Did you know?" "If you didn't know, you should've said so." "You ran away, so we had to chase you." "Why didn't you try to listen to what we were saying?" "We only approached you to explain our intentions to you." "Are we so frightening to you?" "How much do you know about us?" "If we don't talk to each other, we can't get to know each other." I'm so sorry. "We checked your camera." "You shot nothing illegal, so we're returning it." Thank you. I'm truly, truly sorry. A nuke plant? A nuclear accident?! That's Tokyo! Not a nuke plant. It's a fire at an oil refinery in Tokyo Bay. Huh? Really? Also... It seems that many firefighters have died in the blaze. Please return my phone! Where is it?! Is there Wi-Fi around here? Follow him. You can use Wi-Fi here. Thank you. Call me if you need me. I'll be outside. Ryo, pick up... Please, pick up! No... This isn't happening... Ryo, pick up... Please Ryo, pick up... No way. Not him. It can't be. Please... God... Please, God... We heard the news from Tokyo. We're looking into it. No names announced yet. I'll let you know if we hear. Yoko, what's his name? Ryota Ohashi. Got it. Let's go back to the hotel. You can't stay here. I'm sorry. The camera might be broken. Oh. The camera crew's flying back tomorrow. The network's short-handed. I'll stay to shoot scenery. What'll you do? Go home. You should. Ryo! Hello?! Thank God! I was so worried about you! You okay? You're not injured? Thank God... I was going out of my mind! I guess I'm lucky after all. Yeah. Still in Uzbekistan. Yeah. It's a nice place. Everybody's so kind. Alright. This is costing you, so hang up. See you. Bye bye. I'll be back in about five days. Your mic, if you need it. - Over to you. - Got it. Want me to tell Ryota anything? No. Alright, we'll be back. Yeah. Take care. Oh dear! Nothing in this trap either. Where on earth could Aydar Lake's bramul have disappeared to? Cut. What now? He's got another idea. Deep in the mountains near here, his friend saw a legendary mammal, the markhor. What's that? "A fearsome beast with huge horns, and covered in long hair." He'll introduce his friend. No charge. It's complimentary. Let's go. Okay. Much further? Nearly there. Hold up. Let me shoot some scenery. Temur, tripod. I'll scout ahead. Okoo... Even if the sky falls And the earth falls to pieces I won't be afraid As long as you're with me When your warm hands touch me My whole being trembles with the joy of being in love If you wanted me to, I'd go to the ends of the earth with you I'd cut my hair, abandon my home, and even my friends too I'd even betray my homeland I won't be afraid, if you're with me You're all that I need Nothing else matters Even this life of mine Even if you leave one day Even if you pass away I won't grieve for you I'll see you again One day, death will come for me Beyond the blue sky We two are in love And shall never be apart again God will reunite us For we two are in love To the Ends of the Earth
