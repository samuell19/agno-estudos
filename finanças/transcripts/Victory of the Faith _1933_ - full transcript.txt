SA marches, achtung! Let them through! The red front, break them in two! SA marches, achtung! Let them through! So we stand alone in combat With blood our ranks are all a-sweat The gaze ahead, the fist is wound! The streets then from our march resound Honorable Chancellor of the Reich... distinguished guests, Party members... the city of Nuremberg is filled with great joy... and boundless pride... to have been given the honor to host within its walls... the first national party convention of the NSD AP... to be held in the new Reich. My Fuehrer, our warmest welcome... to this ancient German city! On September 2, 1923... we entered this city in large numbers for the first time... then a city still in the hands of enemies. It was a time when it was harder to celebrate than today. In the name of the millions who comprise the movement... of the National Socialist party... I wish the city of Nuremberg future happiness and prosperity. I believe... that the convention and the movement... will help increase the fame of this old German city... and bring it more clearly into the consciousness of the world. To the old German Reich's city Nuremberg. Heil! I open... the fifth party congress of the NSD AP. I open the congress of victory! My Fuehrer... you, as leader of the party... are the guarantor of victory. When others wavered... you remained steadfast. When others urged compromise... you remained firm. When others lost courage... you have renewed courage. When others left us... you clutched the flag more firmly- until the flag became the flag of the nation... and flew in triumph. We greet the leader of the nation... in whom lies the future of the nation. Adolf Hitler, we greet thee. As leader of the National Socialists in the district of the Franks... I offer you my warmest welcome. This is the third time we have gathered in the capital city of the Franks... for a National Socialist Party convention. The great German miracle has occurred. You, my Fuehrer, have determined... that from now on... all party conventions... will take place in the city of Nuremberg. We Franks understand how to thank you for this honor. Just as stalwarts of the Franks... were for centuries faithful to their Emperors... we Franks will now stand... by the Chancellor of the new Germany in unfailing allegiance. The Vice-Secretary of the Italian Fascist Party... His Excellency Professor Marpicati... will address a few words to the congress. Above all, I genuinely thank Rudolf Hess... Hitler's dynamic representative... of the National Socialist Party... for the cordial welcome... given to the Italian representative of the Black Shirts. In the name, and by the charge of the National Fascist Party... I bring to Adolf Hitler... head of the Brown Shirts... the best wishes of Benito Mussolini, the Leader of Fascism. First, a most intense joy... is that today's grand meeting in Nuremberg... is truly a new step... on the way to the secure triumph... of the fascist ideal in the world. I must not make a speech here... but will join in this declaration: Heil Hitler! Heil Mussolini! We gather together To ask the Lord's blessing He chastens and hastens His will to make known The wicked oppressing Now cease from distressing Sing praises to His Name He forgets not His own Lord, not your own Stand silent! Dip the flags! We remember the dead! Raise the flags! Raise your heads! Let the flags wave... and carry the message to all German lands. All that we feel in this hour... we can sum up in the cry: Our sacred fatherland... our one Fuehrer, Adolf Hitler... a threefold Sieg- Sieg- Sieg- Leaders of the political organization... many of you look back on a struggle... that has lasted for years. Today we see the results of that struggle. The National Socialist Party has become the state. Its leaders... today are the leaders of the German Reich... who must answer to history. You, my functionaries... are answerable before God and History... to ensure that there will never again... be a November 1918, in German history... and to accomplish this through the political education of all Germans... so that they become one people, and one expression of a single will. What we dreamed of for years... has become reality. The symbol of the unification of all classes of the German people... has become the symbol of the new Reich... and thus the standard of the German people. The most precious possession in this world is one's own people. For this people, and for the sake of this people... we must strive and fight... and never slacken, never tire... never lose courage, and never- My Fuehrer! My Fuehrer! My Fuehrer! Here stand... 65,000 Hitler Youth... from every part of the German Reich. 65,000 Hitler Youth. Outside this stadium... there are another 1.5 million... and at this hour, they are thinking of you... and of your great work. My German Youth! Just as we are gathered here... my young comrades... as part of the life of the people... so must also be gathered here the entire people. It was, alas, not always so. People did not want to understand each other. Each thought only of himself- at best, of his class alone. We have been witnesses to the consequences... of this failure of spirit. In your youth... you must safeguard what you possess: The great feeling... of comradeship or being part of the group. If you hold on to this... no power in the world will be able to take it from you... you will be one people bound together as tightly... as you are now bound tightly as German Youth... our only hope... the courage and faith of our people. You, my Youth... are indeed the living guarantee... the living future of Germany. Not an empty idea... nor empty formalism... an insipid plan. No! You are the blood of our blood... flesh of our flesh, spirit of our spirit... you are the continuation of our people. May Germany live... and may her future which lives in you be praised! Germany, Heil! The supreme SA leader reports. 100,000 men of the SA... Stahlhelm and SS... are ready for review by the Fuehrer! Heil SA! SA-men, SS and ST-men. Practically to this day... almost 10 years ago... the national socialist movement... in association with other nationalist groups... organized the first major review... of the young German freedom movement... in Nuremberg. What a phenomenal evolution from then until now! Again it is the Party that calls you here... and again you have come... but not the 10,000 of those days... but a multitude of German men. The movement's party convention... has always meant the great parade of its men in review... of men determined and ready... to defend the principles of a community of the people... not only in theory... but in practice. It is a community... without regard to origins... to social standing... to profession, to property... to education- a community which feels united... in great faith... and determination. Not through position of party... not through profession and not through class... but united for our Germany. These flags are not merely an outward sign... but represent a living obligation. Hundreds and hundreds have died for it. Tens of thousands were injured. Hundreds of thousands have lost position and profession. But the extreme faith of all... has changed this from a flag of opposition... to the flag of the Reich. And if for 14 years... the goddess of fortune turned away from us... we know that we ourselves were to blame. We know... she will turn her countenance towards us again... when we have wiped away our dishonor. May heaven be our witness: The debt has been paid! The injustices have been avenged! The shame has been removed! The men of November have fallen! Their power is broken! We want nothing for ourselves... but everything for our nation. We want to achieve nothing for ourselves... but all for Germany. We are mortal... but Germany must live! The banner high! The banner high! Our serried ranks together! SA men march With firm and forceful step Our comrades killed by the Reds and Reactionaries Though dead, in spirit march on with us yet Our comrades killed by the Reds and Reactionaries Though dead, in spirit march on with us yet
