[radio playing] So? How did it go? What did he say? He says the budget is too big. He said he’ll produce if we arrange the funding. If we have the funds, why would we be sitting here? Okay, relax. Did you narrate the story at least? No. He didn’t even listen to the script. Only his EP heard. That too only the synopsis. For that, she had ten thousand questions. "Why’s this like this? Why’s this like that?" "This seems to have logical loopholes." "What’s this character’s core motive?" How'll you know all this from just a synopsis? - Okay, relax. - Pissing me off. Synopsis…synopsis… We’ll see what to do next. Hey, can you please remove that mask? Leave it Gautham, we’ll get through this. How are you even wearing that? You’re inside the car, right? That guy inside was coughing like a terminally ill patient. That’s why. Babe! Come on! Wait. I have a plan, okay? (phone ringing) Why are you calling him now? Hello. [SIBI] Hello…why are you torturing me at this time? We came to Gautham’s office meeting... Oh, ya ya. How did it go? So, get ready. We’re going to come to pick you up. Let's go to Pondy. - It was that bad, is it? Ok ok. - Why Pondy? Let’s go and have a blast. We’re not drinking. We have to be back tonight. And, ask Madhu to be ready. You know she won’t come. You know I won’t come if we don’t drink. Dude, we’ll go there and see. You call Madhu and get ready. Okay wait, she’s next to me only in bed. What?! (sniggers) Just kidding. Okay. We’re leaving now. Get ready. Okay I’ll see you guys, bye. Bye. Babe I’m not really in the mood right now, please. Just relax babe. [ominous music] Nithu! What’s happening Gautham? - What happened? - Nithu, wake up! - Is she okay? - The brake's not working. - What do you mean it's not working? - It's feels tight. What are you saying Gautham? - I think it's jammed. - What are you saying? - I'm scared, Sibi. - Take your leg off the accelerator. It's not working. I have no idea. Why would I simply say that? I'm trying. I don't know what's going on! - Sibi, help me! - Stop screwing around dude. What do you want me to do? I'm fucking trying! - Don't fucking panic. - Slow down! Just wait! What can I do, if the brake is not working? Try the brakes. Try the brakes, Gautham! You're on the wrong side, Gautham! [woman screams] [ambulance siren] Hey! Where...are those two? Don’t know. I've messaged Sibi. Gautham isn't picking up. Did...something go wrong? Not sure. You guys, okay? - Yeah. - Hmmm. Where’s he? He’s not here yet. Call him. I did. Try again. What? He’s not picking up. This is unwanted bullshit. We should have shut up and stayed at home. Sibi, just calm down. This is not the time to point fingers. Madhu, are you okay? - You’re not hurt, right? - No. My…my hands alone hurt a bit. Otherwise, I’m okay. Okay. Just calm down. Don’t worry. It’ll be fine. What's the hurry? I've to drive right? How long Gautham? Do you know how tense we are? You couldn't leave a message at least? Netra, you okay? Okay calm down. I’m sorry. Are you okay? Are you guys okay? Ya ya. But Madhu hurt her hand. Madhu, you want to see a doctor? I can come take you. No no… it's okay… If it gets worse... We can go tomorrow. You sure? Yeah. He's gone mad! What the fuck is wrong with you Gautham? How can you be laughing at a situation like this? Gautham! No no. Sorry sorry. But it’s all taken care of. Absolutely no problem. Don't worry. You sure? If we're caught, we’re screwed. I took care of everything. There’s nothing to worry. It's okay. Fuck. Madhu, it’s fine Madhu. It’s not like we did it on purpose. Nothing’s going to happen. It's fine. Just relax. You sure? I’m really scared Gautham. Why don’t we leave town for some time? Why are you blabbering now? Something like that will only attract more attention to us. Just be quiet, that’s more than enough. Why the hell are you yelling at her? You were the one who drove the car like a maniac. Oh? All this is because of me, right? Can you shut the hell up? I told you I took care of it right? Why are you bugging me? Just shut up, that's enough. Blindly supporting her all the time. (phone ringing) Look, that’s Mugilan sir calling. Hello. Yeah sure sir sure sir. Thank you so much, sir. No, sir. It was an accident, not intentional. Yeah, sure sir. Sir one more thing, I’ve sent you a small gift. Sure sir, please say "hello" to everyone at home. Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. Thank you. What did he say? He said the formalities are over. They’ve gone to the hospital. I think the doctors are performing the surgery now. He says it’s all good. They closed the case, claiming the vehicle was not found. We could have taken her to the hospital ourselves, right? Would you face prison if she died en route to the hospital? - Dude! - It's like we're incriminating ourselves to the cops. Can all of you please shut up? I told you I’m handling it right? Gautham is right. It’s enough if the surgery is successful. What about CCTV cameras on the way? CCTV? In that useless highway? Also, we took the route which Mugilan sir suggested. So, I’m pretty sure we’re safe. How much...money did you give? Not much. I know him for a long time. One lakh for him. And, one and a half for hospital expenses. That’s all? What “that’s all”? It’s not like that person died, right? - Hey! - Why are you talking like this? (door knocking) [SHRUTHI] Gautham! Yeah coming. This guy... Not even a little bit of -- He told you it's been taken care of, right? - Fine…fine… - Leave it. (phone ringing) Behaves like a criminal, but checkout his ringtone. Why do you keep complaining about him? Are you perfect? Please, you don't have to take his side all the time. This is just too much. You're upset Madhu said "no" to you. You're projecting that on us. Hey! What are you guys talking about? Okay, leave all that. If you give us a wedding date, we'll use that as an excuse to get some new clothes and goodies, right? What do you feel about that? It’s not like I don’t want to. But he pulls back whenever I bring that topic up. Sibi... Can you please shut up? Cool cool. (phone ringing) [MADHU'S MOM] Madhu! That divine voice belongs to my mother-in-law, right? Hi! You still didn’t leave? It was all because of your dad. He thinks being late is cool. So, we missed the train. We’re driving there tomorrow morning. Since our trip got postponed, want to come along? I’m not coming, mom. What’s with the empty chat window? His sister called him Aunty. I'm sure he'll only come after hogging something. What happened? You look very tired. I’m okay Mom. You are the one who looks tired. Your hands are cold. Did you take your pills? Just go and sleep. Okay, you have something before going to bed. - Okay bye! - Bye! (Gautham's phone vibrating) Take a shower and then go to bed, Mom. Welcome back sir. Did you stuff your face nicely? No dude. My sister was asking about what happened. Poor thing. She must have been really worried. Yeah. But she won’t show it outside. Leave it. It’s over now. Dude, you got a phone call. Fuck, the battery is dead. Dude, why do you even need two phones? Don't show off. Nithu you don’t find this suspicious? This is my emergency phone for situations like today. - Oh ho! ok ok. - Look to your right. What’s there on that shelf? You mean this? This phone died many years ago. I’m just using it as a prop at home. Happy? I can’t believe you still have that phone. This phone will always be a part of me. It’s very special to me. Please stop. [SHRUTHI] Gautham! - Hi! - Hey! - Hi, sister! - Hello! What’s up people? Heard the trip was amazing! Why are you pulling our leg, Sister? Thanks a lot. In that instance... We didn’t know what to do. Don’t worry. Don’t think about it too much. Thank you, Sister. Netra, how’s Mom? What did the doctors say? Ligament tear. She has to use a wheelchair for a couple of months. Oh okay. If you need any help, ask anytime, okay? Listen, the flight landed a while ago. Your brother-in-law is on his way. Okay? Don’t sleep off. He wants to talk to you. Don’t worry, sister. We won’t let him sleep. - Not before he gets an earful from him first. - You be quiet now. Don’t worry. He just wants to talk, okay? Buh-bye! Dude! Dude, listen. Know what I think? “He just wants to talk”... Doesn’t it sound like, “he’s going to rip you apart”? Shut the fuck up Sibi. Why are you being so insensitive? (phone vibrating) Mugilan sir has called me twice dude. Could there be some problem? There’s absolutely no problem. Dude, didn’t I tell you already that you got calls? What could it be? Just call him back. Why are you afraid? Isn’t it late? He called you, right? It's not even been ten minutes. Do you think he would have slept already? You call. He didn’t pick up. That doesn’t matter. You keep calling him. - What if it’s something important? - Chill chill. Relax. Let’s see if he calls back. If it’s that important he will, won’t he? Or else call him back in the morning. (doorbell ringing) I’m sure that’s your brother-in-law. Go get thrashed. After this... Police won’t come, right? Why should the cops come? Why are you blabbering now? It’s better you keep quiet. He told that it’s all taken care of, right? Dude, shut up. Nobody’s going to come. You relax babe. Correct. Even Netra won’t go to see him... Why would the cops go? I don’t… For once, can you be serious? What’s wrong in what I just asked? I’m only asking because I’m concerned, right? Why do you keep silencing me? I was trying to calm you down, that’s all. You seemed too worried. Okay, I’m sorry. Yes, proceed. Who do you think? It was my brother-in-law only. He said nothing. There was someone with him. That's why he didn't say anything I guess. He just went in quietly. He didn’t say anything? You want us to believe that? Nonsense! What did he say? I swear. He just gave me a weird look and went in. Who has come along? Not sure. Must be a colleague. Colleague? Male or female? Why? You want to hear “no” from her as well? I’m sure he’s used to rejections by now. Had you said "yes," why would I be like this? Forget about them. Negativity! You tell me. She looked good? I don’t know. She looked kind of innocent. Innocent? Innocent and pretty, is it? Then go be with her asshole. Did I say she was pretty? Why don’t you say that and see what happens? Can you keep quiet, please? Whatever. Dude your sister is coming. Listen... You go get some rest, we’ll talk tomorrow. Looks like he is super pissed with me. Nothing like that. He’s just concerned. Imagine what would you have done if it wasn’t for him. Sorry. Relax. Go sleep. Okay? You? I'm making dinner for him. I don't think he ate on the plane. Too paranoid to remove his mask. Wait I’ll order something. Why cook now? I’ll order juice for you. You relax. Okay, don’t order anything spicy. - What about his colleague? - [SHRUTHI'S HUSBAND] - Shruthi! Yeah, I’m coming. Anything, okay. - Goodnight, guys. Buh-bye. - Bye, sister. Dude, order a falooda for me. Yeah right. Falooda it seems. Fuck, I’m hungry. Not sure why... AC is at twenty-six degrees... ...but still I’m feeling super cold. You want to cuddle? Don’t make me abuse you, please. Okay relax. What did you order? Just the usual stuff. And some juice. And…for the guest? Yeah, for her also. (doorbell ringing) Wow that was fast. Your sister is going. When’s your sister expecting? Two more months. Have they decided on the name? Ya ya. But she won’t say anything if you ask her. [cat crying] Gautham? Sister, shut the door properly. The cats have gotten inside again. I hate babies and cats. What happened? It’s nothing. Cats get frisky at night and start yowling. There are two cats outside his house. They’ll be waiting to barge in the moment someone opens the door. Annoying. What? The door is open. My sister and brother-in-law are not there. What do you mean “they're not there”? They must have gone down to get the luggage. What about that innocent-looking guest? Stop being a jerk Sibi. Then you’ll keep bugging me to say “yes” to you. Why are you getting upset? I'm just kidding, right? Both of you just shut up. She’s just relaxing in the guest bedroom. What now? She’s cutting my call. Why are you rushing? Is she a kid? She’s gone out with her husband only, right? (screams) What the fuck? Netra? Are you okay? - You okay? - What happened? Netra, say something Netra. Are you ok? Netra! Netra look at us. What happened? No no…nothing. Nithu, you okay? What happened? What happened? Tell us…what happened? Tell…what happened? Netra! God, what’s going on? Calm, yeah. Tell me. What happened? What happened? What? Felt like something...touched me. What Nithu? What touched you? I don’t know. Are you…are you okay? Must be a muscle spasm, that’s all. As simple as that. What? She keeps cutting my calls. That’s because she doesn’t want to be disturbed. Isn't that obvious? Madhu, you okay? What happened, you okay? - What happened? - Ma! This is milk ma! So? She’s allergic to milk. And I think it is spoilt. Okay you relax. Have a sip of water. Ma! Babe, relax. It must be a muscle twitch, that’s all. You’ll be okay. I’ll give you a massage tomorrow. Yeah, we know what kind of massage that is. Why’s that bothering you? If I tell the reason, will Madhu come and…? - Get lost. - You're just disgusting. How are you still friends with him? Hello! You know him for only ten years. I know him for twenty-three years. - Love you, bro. - Love you, brother. My gosh! What happened? - You okay? - One second. Madhu, you okay? Something wrong? All okay Madhu? What happened? Tell us. What happened darling? Tell us, what happened? My house... Nobody is there! There’s no one at home? What do you mean? Dad… Dad and mom…both of them are gone. Didn’t they go to Bangalore…? No, wait. You guys are fucking with me, right? Trying a prank? That too on me? What? You think people will keep doing stupid pranks? We’re not jobless. Hey idiot! Why are you crying now? Instead of morning, they must have left now, that’s all. They won’t go like this without informing me. Also... Why the hurry...to leave at this time? Maybe Uncle has taken her out to surprise her for her birthday? Don’t cry, Madhu. It’ll be okay. Guys, if this is a prank... - No. - I beg you to stop it. Please I can’t take it. Babe, we didn’t do anything. Don’t cry, love. Call again. She’s not picking up. Try again doll. Hello…Ma. Hello! Where are... Where are you mom? When... When? What happened? What are you saying? What...are you saying Ma? What happened, Madhu? Mom...mom. Mom! Hello! Hello. What happened? What happened? My mom… She’s in Bangalore. You mean they left? She said…she reached there in the afternoon itself. I know you guys are fucking with me now. I fucked up. I know I fucked up. Okay? And for that, now ya'll are fucking with me. I’m sorry guys. I’m sorry. Is this enough? Idiot! Be quiet. You guys saw my mom, right? Gautham if this is you, we’re not in a mood today, please stop it. What the fuck? Why does it always have to be me? Why do you keep pinning things on me? - I’m not saying “you” did it. - No that's exactly what you said. - Understand what I’m saying. - You always fucking do this. Always blame it on me. - Let's calm down. Let's all just calm down. - Don’t back out now. Madhu, listen to me. They must have gone out. Okay? Then why are they saying they're in Bangalore? I don’t know...I don’t know why they would have said that. Uhh...Shall I come there? Something's wrong Gautham. Nothing's wrong. Madhu…Madhu don’t cry, darling. Babe, don’t cry. They must have gone out somewhere. Your dad must have taken her out somewhere. You want us to come pick you up? Madhu? See, I’m leaving right now. No... No no please, don’t leave. Calm. I’m coming. I’m coming. I’m just leaving my house. Stay strong Madhu. I’m just going down my steps. You don’t worry. I’m coming to you, right? You don’t worry... Look, our favorite tea-shop is still open. Don't worry, darling. Go carefully, dude. See, I’m on my way. One more left, and I can see your house. I can see your house. Just one minute. I'm coming. Yeah, I can see your house. Don’t walk like a buffalo. Walk faster. She's talking too much. Control her. Who? Me? True, it’s my fault to have expectations. Stop yapping and just keep going. Sibi are you there? You just open the door. Main door...is unlocked. Sibi, please come quickly. See, I’m almost there. What if someone comes? It’ll look shady if I’m here. Then you'll have no choice but to marry me. I’m just entering your gate. Just keep some juice ready for me. I opened the main door… I’m entering your room… Hi! Dude, what? What happened? What the fuck man? How…? Gautham! Bro, something’s not right. What the fuck? What’s happening, guys? Gautham. I told you I felt something touch me, right? - What? - Yeah. It felt like someone’s hand. - What?! -Shit! Felt like someone grabbed me. What are you saying? Even I thought it was some muscle spasm… But looking at what’s happening right now… Guy, this is not fucking funny. If this is a joke please stop. This is not funny. Bloody idiot! You see what's happening, right? Then how do you explain…? There’s no explanation, that’s the point. Okay, listen. Nithu, where’s your mom? Netra? Netra! Netra, can you hear me? Where’s your mom? She’s sleeping. Go wake her up. Please go Netra. Netra, please trust me, go wake her up. No... I’m scared. I know it’s going to be difficult. But please wake her up. Guys if this is not some fucking joke, and if this is actually happening, we really need to get out. Even I’ll call my sister and ask her not to come, but we all must leave. Come let’s go. No no no. Wait! I’ll go wake up my mom. - Please wait. - Go, Netra... ...you go wake her up. Go! Go! Take your phone. [projector playing] What’s that? Nithu? Netra, what…? Who’s there? (glass falling) Wake her up, Netra. Ma? Ma! Louder! Ma, wake up. She’s not waking up. Just try again. Ma! - Ma! - Wake her up properly! Check her pulse. I don’t know all that, Gautham. Just check if she’s breathing Nithu, come on! Nithu, your mom opened her eyes! She opened her eyes! - I’ll call the ambulance and call you back. - You mom opened her eyes. Netra? (phone ringing) - Hello. Hello, Kauveri? Gautham? You’ve called me. No, I called the hospital No, you called me - No! - Call a general ambulance, not the hospital. Ok...ok... What’s happening dude? (phone ringing) Babe, you’re call me again No, I'm not, why the fuck would I do that? All this is because of you Gautham. Why the fuck is it my fault? Why the fuck do you guys keep blaming me for everything? Ever since the accident today, nothing seems to be right. “I” did the accident, is it? Whose stupid idea was it to do a prank? "This" guy. Why are you dragging me into this? I said “let’s do a prank”. I didn’t ask you to overact and hit somebody. If not for your stupid idea, this wouldn't have happened. Shut the hell up and let her in. - Netra? - What? Did you call the hospital -- Netra? Netra? How’s she walking dude? Didn’t you say she has a ligament tear in her leg? Netra? Shit! Ma? She’s not responding. Your mom has a sleepwalking problem? Do something, Gautham. - Be careful. - Try shaking her up. Ma... Ma! Ma? Ma, come let’s go. What the fuck is happening guys? Ma, please Ma. [heavy breathing] Nithu! Netra, are you okay? Nithu, are you okay? Nithu, are you okay? Nithu! What? Sister, where are you? Where will I be? In my room only. If the food has come, keep it on the table. What are you saying? I came to your room, and nobody was there. Just hang up. Okay guys. I’ll go see my sister and come. Take your phone and go. Hello. You’re irritating me, Gautham. Please don’t hang up. Where are you? What happened to you? Please, I’m really scared right now. What’s your problem, Gautham? Please understand what I’m saying. Sister? Be careful, Gautham. Please be careful. Sister? Can’t you fucking knock? Where are you, sister? Where are you? Tell me! Are you drunk? Close the door now. I said shut the door! Guys, what the fuck? I’m unable to open the main door. I'm fucking stuck! Netra! Netra! Inhale...Inhale... - Breathe. It’s fine. - Oh God! It's okay. Breathe. Netra, don’t worry, okay? Bro…what’s happening? Bro, call Mugilan sir. Put it on speaker. Yeah, call him immediately . He's not answering. Keep calling him. Don’t stop till he picks up. [INSPECTOR] Hello. Who’s this? Hello, Mugilan sir, hello? Who are you? My name is Gautham. I need to talk to Mugilan sir. Gautham…? Hold on a second. Call that guy and ask him to get here now. Hello, sir? Just hold on sir. Yeah, tell me. Sir...hello sir. I need to talk to Mugilan sir. You won't pick up your phone, sir? How many times do I have to call? Sorry sir, my phone was on silent. I really need to talk to him. Please, sir. Mugilan sir was discussing about your case with me. Sir? Why with you, sir? Don’t worry. Only I know. I called you for something important. Why didn’t you pick up sir? I’m really sorry sir. My phone was on silent. I badly need to talk to Mugilan sir. Please sir. That’s the reason I called you so many times. Mugilan sir died in an accident. What the fuck? Hello! Hello sir, are you there? Sir, are you sure? I just met him a while ago. Yeah, you’re right... It’s not even been an hour since the accident. The last person he spoke to was you. How do you know him? He’s my brother-in-law’s close friend sir. What happened, sir? Remember we admitted your hit-and-run victim to the hospital? That girl succumbed to her injuries and died a while ago. - What? - Doctors tried their best, but couldn't save her. After finishing the hospital formalities, he was on the side-walk, having tea. An over-speeding car that was crossing our lane, dodged a dog that was on the road, and hit him instead. He died on the spot. He was telling me you’re prepared to help the girl's family. So, I’ve mailed you the case file and the related documents. Just keep me in mind, sir. This is a huge case. Now, the girl has died too. I’m taking a huge risk for you. Think and let me know. Dude, ask him for help. - Ask him to come here now. - Sir, hello? Sir, we need your help. Please help us. My friends and I are stuck here. We’re in Anna Nagar Shanthi Colony, 4th main -- I told you right? He died in an accident, sir. Sir, please. We really need your help. - Hello, sir? - I told you right? He died in an accident sir. Can’t you bloody listen to me? I’m telling you we’re stuck here! Hello? Don’t yell, Gautham. I told you right? He died in an accident sir. I told you right? He died in an accident sir. - I told you, right? He died in an accident. - Gautham, what the hell? [CHARU] I bloody told you right? I died in the accident! Oh god! Check your mail dude. Dude! Check your mail! What is it? Show us also. Gautham, who’s that? What? Who’s that? Is this the girl that died in the accident? Bro… This is the girl I saw. Where? This is the guest who came home with my brother-in-law. What? How’s this possible? You said you took care of everything. Now see! Dude! What did I do? All this, it’s because of you. You guys are the reason. How the fuck is it our fault? You, Madhu, Sibi, you guys did it! I didn’t do anything. Dude! Don’t just throw away words Gautham. You first shut up. You instigated this, and because of you this moron kept pushing me to prank her, and all this happened. In fact, it wasn’t me who turned the steering. I’m the last fucking person you can blame. You all need to be blamed. Fuck! Hey Charu…if you want to do something, start with them. - Start with fucking them. - You idiot! - Leave me alone. - Why are you talking like this? Hey shut up! Madhu, look behind. Madhu… Madhu, behind you! - Madhu, behind you! - There’s no one here. Madhu... Your mom is sitting behind you. What? Check properly. There’s nobody...here. Just now... Fuck. - Madhu. - Shit! No one is here. Madhu. There’s absolutely nobody here. Baby nothing’s going to happen to you. Be strong. Madhu...don’t cry babe. Madhu, it’s okay, Madhu. You took care of everything right? Handle this also! Why are you yelling at me? Even I'm unable to go out. I deserve this and much more for going out with you guys. It was your stupid idea. All this is because of you. Just stop! Can you both please shut up? Focus on what we can do next. Why did you guys do this? I would have simply stayed at home. All this was because of you. - Madhu. - Tomorrow is my mom’s birthday. Why, Sibi? Madhu…Madhu... Listen we all need to calm down. Okay, we need to pull ourselves together, okay? Sibi, you’re doing all this because I said “No” to you, right? Madhu, please listen to yourself. What’s that got to do with this? What are you talking about? What did she say? Sibi, she’s saying something in anger. - Don’t listen to her. - No...no... I know she’s talking in anger. But... How’s she talking without stammering? Madhu! What happened? - Your eyes! - Madhu... Your eyes! Madhu, your eyes. I don’t see anything. What? Madhu... - Madhu, what’s wrong with you? - Madhu! - Madhu? - Madhu, what are you doing? Babe please, look at me. I don’t see anything. Madhu! Bro, what’s happening to her? Madhu... Fuck... Madhu, please Madhu. - Madhu. - Madhu! Madhu... [baby crying] Did you hear that? Sounds like a cat crying. No! Wait…wait... It’s not a cat. Doesn’t it sound like a baby crying? Your sister is calling you. Go. Madhu? Sister? I said go. Sister... [baby crying continues] Gautham, that doesn’t look right. Sister... Sister, please come. Let's leave. Gautham? Please look at me. I’m really scared, please. Gautham, look at your sister’s tummy. Sister... Sister? [demonic baby screeching] What the fuck is that? No…no…please. Get out of there bro! Sister, please. No...no... Sister, please. Don’t go there! - I'm begging you, please. - Gautham, don’t follow here! Don't go! Please, sister. Please, sister... Sister! No...no...please don't go inside! Sister! Don’t go inside, Gautham! Sister? Gautham? What have you done to my sister? Where’s she? I’m bloody going to kill you. Where’s my sister? Please, Madhu. Tell me where she is. Madhu, please. Madhu, what happened? - Madhu! - Madhu...please, Madhu. Please Madhu... Where's my sister, Madhu? Okay mom, I’ll take care of it. Madhu, that’s not your mom! - Madhu. - Madhu! Madhu... Where’s she going? Madhu? Madhu, what is that? What are you doing? Madhu, what’s that? Madhu? Madhu... Madhu! I would have said "yes" to you, Sibi. Madhu, don’t do anything stupid. What?... What are you saying, Madhu? Babe, look at me! Madhu! Look at me! Stop! Stop! Your previous birthday, I wanted to surprise you… By asking you out. I came to your house… Around eleven thirty maybe. That day... Your main door was open, Sibi. Madhu! I’m sorry, Madhu. Madhu! Babe, please stop. Madhu! - Madhu, I'm sorry. - Madhu! Throw that away, Madhu. - Madhu, no! - Madhu, no no no...please don't. - Madhu, please no! - Madhu, please Madhu. No! - Madhu, please no! - No Madhu...No, no, no... Madhu! No Madhu. Please... - Please Madhu. - Madhu! Madhu, no! - Please, Madhu. - Madhu, please stop! Can you hear me, Madhu? Wait…wait. I’m coming. I’m coming right now. [door banging] Charu! - Madhu! - Let me open this damn door. Madhu... Madhu, no Madhu... - Madhu! Madhu, what are you doing? Please, stop. - Madhu, please. No, Madhu. -Madhu, no! Please, Madhu. - Madhu! - Please don't do anything Madhu. Madhu? Oh fuck, Madhu. No, Madhu. No! Madhu! - Madhu! - Madhu, no! Madhu, please don’t leave me. Madhu...Madhu! Madh -- Fuck...Fuck...Fuck! Oh fuck...Madhu! Oh God! Madhu! Madhu...Madhu... Madhu... - God! - Take another puff. Madhu! Madhu...She’s gone. Are you okay, Nithu? Breathe. Fuck! Fuck! Sibi... Leave him alone. Give him some time. Bro... I’ve made a big mistake. What happened? On my last birthday... Madhu’s college friend Varsha came home. To get something from me… DVD or pen drive. Not sure what. You always knew that she had a thing for me, right? Even I was super drunk that day... No! Don’t tell me -- No! No! We just... We just made out. I’m not trying to justify what I did. But... I thought I heard my door opening that day. But I didn’t bother with it. Ever since then... Madhu started acting weird with me. I asked her several times. She didn’t say anything. All this is because of me. Dude, stop. We need to figure out how to escape from this. We need to focus on that, so please just stay with me. Please. Madhu... [phone ringing] Bro... This is Madhu’s old landline number. Sibi, no! Hello Madhu! - Sibi! - Where are you? - Stay there, I’m coming. - Sibi, no listen to me. - Madhu, I love you. I love you so much. - Sibi, listen. That's not Madhu! Sibi, please listen to me. I’m so sorry for all that I’ve put you through. You be right there! You be right there, I'm coming. - Please listen to me Sibi. - She died! Look at the screen! Madhu is dead! Look at the screen. She's gone. Please listen. You shut up and check properly. She is not there. Stay there, stay right there. I’m coming. I love you. I love you so much. Please listen to us, Sibi! I'm coming to you! I'm coming to you. Dude, no. You stay right there. I’m coming to you. Sibi, please listen to us... We can't go out. If you can, it means she wants you to come out. Please Sibi, listen to me. Don’t go anywhere. I’m coming soon to you. - I'm coming to you. Don't worry. - Sibi, please listen to us... - Please, Sibi. - I love you, darling. Listen to me, Sibi! - I'm so sorry...Madhu. - Sibi, please bro. - I'm coming to you... (car honking) [crowd cluttering] Sibi! Brother, how's my friend? Please check on him... Sibi! I told you not to go Sibi. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Nithu... Babe? Remove Madhu from the call. Give me one second. Babe… I’m really sorry... I’ve hurt you a lot... Thanks for enduring all that. - Why are you suddenly telling me this? - No! Just... Let me finish. I just…I just want you to know that... I really love you. And... If I have to spend the rest of my life with someone... It'll only be you. There’s…there’s no one else. It’s always…it’s always you. And… I really love you. This is for you. You had to tell me this now? If not now, I don’t know if I’ll get another chance. Actually, I wanted to arrange a small party and propose in front of everyone. But uh… Netra... Will you -- [projector playing] What was that? Madhu...Sibi... Like you said, next it's me, right? No, Nithu. (door knocking) Nithu are you okay? Nithu, talk to me, are you okay? Please Nithu, tell me. Are you okay? [door knocking continues] Fuck! Hey Charu, come here. I’m here. You only want me, right? Come get me. Gautham please, keep quiet. Nithu, just listen to me... I’m going to buy you some time. You'll know when the time is right, just run! Don’t worry about anything. Just run, okay? Don’t do anything. Hey, Charu! It's okay, Nithu. Please, Nithu. Run, Nithu! Who are these guys? Is this an original video? (cluttered talking) I know this Netra. A similar accident has happened before. That girl’s name is also Charu. [number not reachable] To all my fans. Our job here is not done. If you have any information about them, drop it in the comments. If it's authentic, you’ll get a brand-new iPhone. Is this true? Does anyone have details of this accident? What happened to the people in this video? The photo of the girl in the movie and the girl in this news are matching. I’ve opened a “Justice for Charu” page on Instagram. Follow that page. I’m sure she'll get justice. There’s a page called “Netra Army” already? Who are you guys? Where do these sleeper cells come from? If the accident really happened, this video is like a confession, right? Yeah, definitely. What do you guys think? Do you think the cops will take this as a confession? Guys one of our followers has sent me a DM in Instagram. People who haven’t subscribed to our channel, subscribe! Press the bell icon. An interesting video is going to drop in very soon. Hello and welcome to Cine Talk South. First of all, thank you for letting us use your space. Don’t worry, the cameraman will put the place back the way it was. And…looks like one character is missing here. Yeah, our heroine Netra is a little busy today. So... First of all, how much of this was real? Let’s not say “real”. How much did you plan? Because looking at the incidents, it just feels unbelievable. No. Actually we planned each and everything. So, when you decide to make a film, you wrote the entire script? No, we already had a hit-and-run script. We pitched that to a producer. But that didn’t go as planned. So, my friends wanted to take a break and go to Pondy. It was on our way back, we saw the accident. Do you mean you actually saw it? No, the accident had already happened when we got there. We wanted to help, but they had already put her in an ambulance. But we got her driving license on the crime scene. It was then we decided to link this incident to our script. We knew this was a bit risky and unethical. But we knew if we linked our script to a real-life incident, we would get a better reach for our film. - Yeah, definitely. The same night we incorporated the actual event into our script. Sibi handled the camera. Madhu did the makeup. And Netra, as all of you know, acted in the film. We already raised funds on Patreon to do a big-budget short film. So, using that we shot the film in five to six days. Five to six days? That’s all? That’s all we could afford. We shot the entire film using the “Sync” app itself. The music director is our friend, so he had the tracks and OSTs ready. We shot day and night. The catch is, if we delayed, people would come to know about the incident, and the story will become stale. We had that risk factor. That’s why we worked overtime and completed the film. I get all that, but what about cops? When there’s an investigation going on, didn’t you feel this would disturb them? Weren’t you afraid they might suspect you and take you into custody? What the use? They caught him, locked him up, and treated him like a "king" inside. Let’s discuss that off-camera. Dude, come on! They gave me a warning and let me go. I think they had the CCTV footage and toll information... So, they knew we didn’t do it. So, by any chance did you see her? Charulatha right? Did you meet her? Yeah, uh… We went to the hospital a few days ago. But -- I mean, we couldn’t see her directly. We saw her through the glass. It was heartbreaking to see her like that. But hopefully, if she’s better, we’ll go see her soon. Wait, nobody told you anything? She passed away last night. I thought you guys knew. Oh wow! Hi guys! Sorry for the delay. I went to put my power bank on charge. “Hi bro. The movie was great” Thank you! Thank you so much. “Where is Netra?” Bro, Mahesh087... Hi bro! we’re about to sign a film. Once it gets official, I’ll update you immediately. “Made the mistake of watching the movie alone”. Sorry bro. Hi bro, Jackfruit_Satish... How do you come up with these names? Once we sold the movie, we gave half of the profit to that girl’s family. Hey Madhu! What are you doing here? Where are you guys? Huh? You moron... I’m starving here. Come fast dude, please. Friends, look! Observe and learn how to do useless pranks -- Don’t learn actually. Horrible behavior, both of them. Nithu, you too? Why are you guys doing this to me? I’m famished, please come quickly. “Don’t open the --” (doorbell ringing) Hmmm... What? Another elaborate plot, is it? Your involvement is mesmerizing. “Will you make part two, bro?” No bro. Part one itself drained us completely. No way part two! - Swiggy sir. - Yes! Hmmm... Yes, tell me. My friends sent you, right? Another Prank? No sir. The order has been placed from this location only. What order? Two chicken rolls, one Caesar salad, and...two watermelon juice. Bro... This is the order I placed in my movie. Come on, seriously? No sir. The order has been placed in the name of Charu from this same number. Hmmm. This is called method acting. Okay, give it here. Sir? What? So, it wasn’t you who actually hit the girl? Bro, that was an accident. Based on that we did our film, that’s all. You’ve made a big mistake sir. What mistake? The cops don’t know who hit Charu. In fact, nobody knows. Why, even Charu doesn’t know. Now, you’ve taken that blame unnecessarily. - Charu will surely come. - Hmmm... Bro, enough. You can leave. (woman sobbing) [projector song playing] [song continues]
