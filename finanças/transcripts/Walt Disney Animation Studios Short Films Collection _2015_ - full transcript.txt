-Wonderful -Wonderful -Marvelous -Marvelous A man with the strength of many John Henry has been one of my favorite stories growing up as a kid. And I just love its timeless quality. And after completing my work on the feature film Mulan, I started thinking about bringing John Henry to life. It's an amazing process. We actually got to visit the actual tunnel site where the John Henry story and the John Henry legend was born. It's in a little town called Talcott, West Virginia. We had a ball putting this short together. And now, I'm very proud and pleased to introduce it to you, and hope that you enjoy it as much as we did putting it together for you. Wonderful Wonderful -Marvelous -Marvelous -A man with the strength of many -Yes, he was -Brave and bold with a heart of gold -John -John Henry was a mighty man -Mighty man Born with a hammer right in his hand Oh, oh... Every soul has a dream, and every heart has a way to make it so. Now, let me tell you about my John Henry, who laid down his life for his dream. John and me were born slaves. Nothing to call our own. Not even each other. Then the day of jubilation came, and all the slaves were free. And John vowed, "Never again." And with that, I had those chains forged into a mighty hammer, a present for John on our wedding day. You'd have thought he'd gotten his freedom all over again. He said, "Polly, I'll die with this hammer in my hand." And off we set to find work and a place of our own. Now, the C&amp;O Railroad had promised land. Fifty acres to every man who finished the line. But when John and I came up on them, they were already worn out, and about to lose their promised land. Lads, deadline's been moved up. If we do not get to the other side of that mountain, we can kiss our land goodbye. -What? -That can't be done! -We had a deal! -It's not fair. -We're working as hard as we can! -I'll take you there. And when did you start building railroads? Today. Well, come on, John You're the one that we're depending on Swing that hammer with all your might I know you can show 'em how to do it right Hoo, sha Hoo, sha Hoo, sha John's hammer rang out, and the tall tales grew. John Henry, John Henry John Henry is a mighty man Born with a hammer -A 10-pound hammer -A 20-pound hammer Right in his hand I heard John's mama liked to sew at night So he pulled down the moon for a little bit of light Took a lot of cooking to keep John fed Ten dozen eggs and eight loaves of bread John Henry, John Henry John Henry is a mighty man Born with a hammer Born with a hammer Born with a hammer right in his hand He plowed the earth So wide and deep The seed he sowed The ground had to keep His hammer hit the earth with such a mighty blow Everything he planted Would jump up and grow John Henry, John Henry John Henry is a powerful man All our lives we've been so poor John, let me show you what we're working for Canaan Land, Canaan Land Everybody working for the Canaan Land Home and freedom hand in hand Workin' for the Canaan Land -Oh, movin' on down the line -John Henry John Henry came right on time -Now we're movin' -Movin' on down the line John Henry came right on time -Home and freedom -Home and freedom hand in hand Workin' for the Canaan Land Yeah... -What is that thing? -It's a steam drill. That thing's gonna take our jobs. But... But we had a contract. -We had a deal! -Let's get it! Push it over. This ain't no way to settle things. But, John, they're throwing us away like we was nothing. I've got a better way. A challenge. I've got two free hands and a 20-pound hammer. If I can best this here machine, the land you promised is ours. John, we're free. You don't have to do this. Polly, if they steal our dreams, they put a chain around our souls. Somebody's got to stand tall. Believe in me. -Go, John. -John's gonna do it. Come on, John. Show that steam drill! Furthest by sundown, gentlemen. -You can do it! -This is it. You can do it, John! John Henry, John Henry John Henry is a mighty man John Henry, John Henry John Henry is a powerful man Hoo, sha Hoo, sha -Steel drivin' man -John Henry was -Steel drivin' man -Oh, yes, he was So proud defiant A gentle giant A steel drivin' natural man John wins! It's not sundown yet. Well, a-come on, John You're the one that We're dependin' on Swing that hammer Bust that rock Come on, give it everything you've got John Henry, John Henry John Henry is a mighty man Born with a hammer Born with a hammer Born with a hammer Right in his hand John and the drill made the valley shake Rumblin' almost caused an earthquake Thunder and lightning was everywhere Oh, Lord, that battle was beyond compare John Henry, John Henry John Henry is a powerful man Born with a hammer Born with a hammer Born with a hammer Right in his hand Aye, Polly, he did it. And he was smiling 'cause he moved that mountain and led us to the promised land. You can move mountains, too, baby. All you got to do is believe. Don't you be scared of that thunder no more, child. The storm's done rolled away, and that's just the sound of your papa driving steel to glory. So just remember. No mountain too high No valley too low No river too wide No place too far to go Oh, believe If you believe you can overcome The battle is already won Oh, just keep on Just keep on keepin' on Stand tall just like John -No matter who you are -No matter No matter where you're from -Nothing can stop you -Nothing can stop you From who you can become Just keep on keepin' on Keep on -Stand tall just like John -Stand tall -Just keep on keepin' on -You gotta keep on -Stand tall just like John -No matter -No matter who you are -No matter No matter where you're from Nothing can stop you Nothing can stop you From who you can become Just keep on keepin' on Keep on Stand tall just like John Just keep on keepin' on I said keep on -Stand tall just like John -Hey, yeah -Just keep on keepin' on -Keep on -Stand tall just like John -Hey, yeah -Just keep on keepin' on -Oh, keep on -Stand tall just like John -Hey, yeah I was asked by Don Hahn and Roy Disney if I would take over an idea that Joe Grant had developed of this cat named Lorenzo who gets a jinx put on his tail, and the tail comes to life. He can't get away from his own tail. Don thought it would be great to go to a tango. This was just a word to me, tango. So I went to the store in Burbank immediately and went to the tango section. The only thing I could do was grab every CD that was there. We end up going with the first CD, the first track, out of hundreds of picks. It means the world to me that we're finally getting it released, so I'm thrilled to share it with you and I hope you enjoy it. Concentration. The Little Matchgirl was actually part of a project that we were referring to at the time as "The Music Project." So we were really kind of working at trying to make this really deal with world music. I've worked on a lot of features, but the shorts offer, often times, a unique opportunity for music, where music can actually be the star, or the co-star with the images. There's no dialog and no sound effects, so the music is really the one component driving the emotional journey with the images. And now, for your viewing enjoyment, The Little Matchgirl. When John Lasseter started soliciting short ideas from some of the story people in the department, I was thinking about some of the classic Disney characters, and I was always drawn to the classic Goofy short. And I thought, "It would be great to see a new How-To Goofy short." No matter how many of those Goofy shorts you look at, we don't see the same sort of technology back then. So we did have to try and do different variations of that. We actually re-used a couple of the backgrounds from some of the old shorts from the '40s, and put them into this short. So we hope you have your television and all of its components properly hooked up and connected. -Choose the correct remote. -Yes. And trim off all those extra wires sticking out the bottom of the TV. Right. So, assuming that's all done and ready to go, we hope you enjoy How to Hook Up Your Home Theater. The greatest of sporting spectacles. The most sacred of all pastimes. Watching the big game. Hey! Down in front. On these glorious occasions, there is no greater love than that between the average man and his television. Modern sports fans, however, can fully immerse themselves in game day with a new home theater system. The advanced technology practically puts the viewer on the field. A convenient trip to the neighborhood electronics boutique will fulfill all the average consumer's needs. Here lies a high-tech wonderland, where audio-video dreams come true. The heavenly journey begins with a few key components. The DVD, the CD, the LD the DVR, the VCR, audio receiver, AV cables, TV tables, satellite dish with satellite, the Blu-ray, the Green-ray, the Hoo-ray, the hi-fi I-Y, HDMI, the heebie-jeebies and E equals M-C squared. And don't forget the batteries. They're not included. Selecting the proper television is of utmost importance, and there are many models from which to choose. A conservatively-sized unit is the most prudent selection. I love you. Let's move on, shall we, to delivery day! The wait is over! Kickoff in high-definition is just a few connections away. And any moment now, the sights and sounds of the big game will fill the home. The delivery truck will arrive promptly, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Any moment now, the roar of the stadium crowd will reverberate 'round the room. Any moment now, the viewer will be hopelessly lost in pure televised wonderment! Any moment now. Right on time. As the friendly drivers delicately deliver the electronics with their usual professional precision, one should take great care in unpacking the fragile components. Items can shift slightly during shipping. The enclosed instruction manuals are of great assistance to the average man. Be sure to read all the provided literature. After removing the audio/video cables from their consumer-friendly, hassle-free packaging... ...connect them to the appropriate cable jacks, which are conveniently located in the back. The modern sound system includes a multitude of speakers to provide the perfectly balanced soundscape. The center channel, left and right front speakers, a-bit-more-to-the-left and a-bit-more-to-the-right speakers, surround speakers, surrounding-surround speakers, and various-overkill-to-ensure- eventual-deafness speakers! And the all-important subwoofer. One should carefully mount each speaker in its proper yet discreet location. Perfect! And now, the marvel of the most modern home... Oh, for Pete's sake, look at the time! The big game's starting! Quick, quick! The remote control! Wait! You did purchase a universal remote. At last! Installation is complete! It is? Gaze upon that pristine picture. Savor the surround sound. It's almost like being there! I used to have this little clock that used to sit up on our mantel at my house and, every night, I would turn off the light to the family room there, and I'd watch that little clock go into the dark. And clocks have such a personality to them. They literally have a face, they have little feet. It was very easy to come up with an idea where a clock would be in a clock shop, and have an attitude, and a personality. And I think what was really interesting about making Tick Tock Tale, it was at a time where we didn't have a lot of the animators at our disposal. We had trainees at the time, and those trainees really did a lot of the heavy lifting on this short. A lot of people put some hard work into it. We were a little team, but we had a lot of fun doing it, and I hope you enjoy it. You there! Stay right where you are! Stop! Most of our characters that we like to create actually are modeled after people that we know, or have elements of ourselves in them. I think that's where we draw a lot of our inspiration from. So Magee, as a character, is the... Christmas Eve command center... -...Coordinator. -Coordinator, right. MPCECC for short. Something like that, I think. She's there to manage Prep and Landing elves and make sure that their job is done in time. And she has a similar look and a similar design as inspired by someone that's on part of our team. Someone we work closely with. Maybe, visually, there's a little bit of a similarity you can see there. It's interesting having a character modeled after yourself. It's weird to see, and things that they would write into the script was like, "Wait a minute, I don't act like that. -"I don't say that." -Yeah, she does. We're so excited for you to see Prep and Landing: Operation: Secret Santa. It's really near and dear to our heart, and we hope you'll enjoy it just as much as we had making it. Hey, Wayne, do you think this is some sort of drill or something? Beats me, partner. She said to meet her here immediately. You're late. Lanny. Wayne. Roasting chestnuts, Magee! What's the deal here? I know as much as you do. Clearly a "Silent Night" operation. Your contact is waiting in there. Good luck. And if something happens to you, I just wanted to say I'm claiming your snowmobile. -I canceled the insurance. -Okay, bye! What does she mean "If something happens?" -And who's this contact? -Come on, it's the Big Guy's sleigh, it could only be one person. Mrs. Claus! Keep your voices down. Would you boys like some hot chocolate? I'm not sure if it's appropriate for a secret meeting, but, what the heck. Anything for you Prep and Landing elves. Aren't you the stealthy ones? Yup, that's us. Good. Because I have an important mission for you. I need your special skills in retrieving this item. -A wooden box? -It's tucked away in a secure location. Inside Santa's office. Of course, he practically lives there, he's so busy this time of year. But he does take his daily nap just before 3:00. I've recorded some more details on this little doohickey here. Don't let me down, boys. This is a bad idea, Wayne! Sneaking into Santa's office? While he's sleeping? We're going on the Naughty List for sure! -What's this? -My hat. And what are you doing right now? Worrying? And what do we do when we worry? Put it in the hat? Very good. Stay in the hat. Stay in the hat. Stay in the hat. Lanny? Wayne? What do you think... You two are going on the Naughty List! You get coal! Ho! Ho! Go! Lanny. Hey, hey, hey, Lanny. I think my hat is leaking! I hope this is recording. Is this thing on? Okay. This tree thingy should be on the bookshelf. You need to lock each section into place. I was never that good at trimming the tree. Wait, wait, wait, wait! The most festive side always faces out. Got it! -What's happening? -I have no idea! Please don't wake up. Please don't wake up. Great garland! By now you should be in Santa's Secret Workshop. This is where my husband likes to tinker around and keeps all of his treasures and... Gosh, mostly just stuff I don't want in my house. This is so tinsel! Watch out for that giant Nutcracker! We used to have it in our foyer and I would trip over that thing. They should have called it a hip cracker. Now, let's see. The box is probably somewhere around his work bench. Just look for that giant pile of manly clutter. Jingle Time. You know what this calls for? The old Gift Exchange! -Yes! -Great job, Tree skirt. Oh, frostbite. Permission to worry now? Permission granted. -We're out of time! -Not quite. I've waited so long for this day! Santa's had this wheel piece tucked away for a long time now, but the rest of it, I finally managed to find again. What is it? Merry Christmas, sweetheart! Oh, my. Is this what I think it is? The first toy I ever made. Thank you. Thank you all so much. Mission accomplished, partner. I really wanted that snowmobile. So, The Ballad of Nessie, in my mind, had the longest development period of any short film in the history of Disney Animation. -You wanna talk about that a little bit? -Yeah. Actually, when I was a kid I used to draw these little dragon characters all over the place. I drew them on napkins when my folks would go out to dinner, I drew them everywhere. And then 20 years later, I went to animation school, and I had to do a student film, and I thought, "What should I do my student film about?" And I thought, "Why don't I utilize the character "that I'd been drawing for the last 20 years." What's remarkable to me is how similar it is in certain ways to what the final short that we directed became. When we met with our composer, Michael Giacchino, who's done the music for all of our projects, he came in with a musical theme that he had himself written many, many years ago. When you have a strong piece of music, it just really immerses you into that whole world of Nessie. It is... You feel like you're there, and you're in there with her. And now we're happy to present to you The Ballad of Nessie. In the bonny blue highlands, where the bagpipes play, lives a creature called Nessie, but it wasn't always this way. Before her great loch had ever been seen, shy Nessie lived life on the moors of Glenkeane. She was rumored a monster, which wasn't quite right. For she was really a softie, with no bark, and no bite. And with a wee friend that she had, the kind loyal and true, they played hide and seek in a pond just for two. Until one gloomy, gray day, at a quarter past two, from some distant, dark land, came a tartan-clad crew. With no time to waste, and a toot and a bugle, no expenses were spared, for tycoon MacFroogle! This place is perfection, it's just what I need. With a few slight corrections, it will be heaven indeed. Her small protests fell on naught but deaf ears. Brilliant, sir, brilliant. Nessie's anger burned bright, her eyes flickered with tears. Then a friend scolded, and told her... Keep a stiff upper lip. Don't cry, be a brave heart, chin up now, pip pip! Nessie gritted her teeth, and decided to pack her whole kit and kaboodle, and her dear friend, MacQuack. Fore! She set off to search for a new pond that could serve, a place with no golf clubs and no AstroTurf. But every pond was empty, every well was dry, every trough was spoke for, yet still she had to try. She traveled each road, and sought out every route. But instead of finding home, poor Ness got the boot. And the reward for her efforts, it was always this quip... Only wee babies cry, chin up now, pip pip. Nessie finally pooped out. She'd reached the end of her rope. Where do you go, when there is no more hope? She stifled a whimper, and a lump in her throat. Chin up now, pip pip. She recited by rote. What began as a trickle, soon turned to a shower. Nessie cried and she cried, she cried by the hour. She cried cups, and pitchers, and bottles, and buckets. She cried tubs and barrels, quintets and quintuplets. For days Nessie cried, nay, for weeks on it went. Till one day she sniffed, her tears finally spent. In surprise she looked up, at MacQuack there, afloat? Dunkin' and bobbin' in what looked like... A moat, nay, 'twas a lake! A great loch! Nessie gasped in delight. Sure 'twas paradise, with no golf tee in sight! Nessie learned herself a lesson on that bright and happy day. And it bears worth repeatin', no matter what folks may say. Don't ever be afraid to cry, it really is okay. Sometimes it's through our tears, we find a better way. As for Nessie, and MacQuack, well, they're still there, I guess. Forever playing hide and seek, all along Loch Ness. So the original idea for the Tangled Ever After storyline was that, they wanted to do a wedding for Flynn and Rapunzel. It was something that we didn't get to do in the movie. We wanted to give people the wedding. We don't want to make fun of it. We wanted you to feel like you saw Flynn and Rapunzel get married. But we also thought we'd like to spend some more time with Maximus and Pascal, and see what kind of trouble they could get into. Coincidentally, when we were in story on Tangled Ever After, the actual royal wedding of William and Kate was happening at the same time in London. Yeah, it was a really fun way to caricature real-world events, and bring them into our fairytale world. This is Tangled Ever After. I hope you have as much fun watching it as we did making it. This is the story of the day my life ended. Eugene. I'm kidding! It was the happiest day of my life: our wedding day. The biggest shindig to hit the kingdom in forever. Everyone dying to catch a glimpse of me. Us! I meant "us." Everything was perfect. Just like I always dreamed it would be. Yeah. Everything was... Oh, come on! They still can't get my nose right? It was a magical day, and everything went just as we planned. Well... Almost. -Wow. -Wow. Wow. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the joining of Rapunzel and Eugene in marriage. They will live their lives together as husband and wife in everlasting peace. May I have the rings? Those were my grandmother's wedding rings! The kingdom is lost! ...and the mutual respect which they bring to their life together had their roots in the love and friendship and guidance you have given them. The union of two people... Get that thing! ...held in reverence, dignity, honor, respect... Frying pans! Commemorative frying pans here! Get your frying pans here! Frying pans! That's the signal! Release the doves! There's the doves! Release the lanterns! ...in everlasting peace. May I have the rings? I... I... I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss. Yay! Happy birthday! So! Who wants a piece of cake? Paperman looks a little bit different than most CGI animation. John Kahrs, the director, was inspired by coming to Disney as the head of animation on Tangled, and seeing all of the hand-drawn art that's around, all the line work, all the design, and thinking, "Could we get some of that into our CG animation somehow?" What's incredible to me is how the experiments that you and Jeff were doing, and the line work that John was falling in love with came together to make a look that really supported the story. And it just was this incredible kismet of two different techniques that just live together so beautifully in this short. And here's Paperman. Enjoy it. Lauren MacMullan, our director, said it would be really great to do a combination of hand-drawn animation and CG animation with Mickey Mouse and with the classic characters. They'd be behind the screen, and they get through the screen. And John Lasseter said, "I want to make that short." One of the exciting challenges of Get a Horse! was to create Mickey in CG, to actually create the computer animation. There's all sorts of cheats that you guys in CG had to do to match the kinds of cheats that we do in animation. With Mickey's nose, when you see it in a profile, it points up like this, off the muzzle. When you see it front-face, it's actually flat on his muzzle. So then, they had to figure out, three-dimensionally, how to do that when Mickey turns his head. -Enjoy the show. -Have fun. Minnie! -Make way for the future! -Hey! -Mickey! -Minnie! I'm gonna knock you right into next week! Hey! My nachos! Hello. Oh, my gosh! Red! Mickey! All alone, without your little pal. -Mickey! -Minnie! Beat it! -Now... Now, wait a minute, mister. -Too late! -Minnie! -Mickey! Mickey! Get out of there! -Minnie! Minnie! Minnie! -Mickey! Gee, Minnie! Hey, pal! It's you! To get your messages, press one. Hey! Want some candy? Alley-oop! Mickey, where are you? What the... -Minnie! -Mickey! Minnie! Give me back my phone! Telephone! Attaboy! Yeah? -Minnie! -Help! Help! Help! I'll save you! -Mickey! -Minnie! Where are we? Poughkeepsie? My nachos! I knew I'd get you! Here, bully, bully, bully! Take that! Hey, fellers! Who done that? Mickey, do it again! Isn't it lovely? Why, you little... Hot dog! Hey, wait a minute! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Not again. -Why, you... -Do it again! Hey! You! Pete don't like this! Daddy? It's you. I used to have a little cat once. Company dismissed! -Minnie! -Mickey! Get a horse! Goodbye! Goodbye, little feller! Hey, come back here! Hey! The whole idea behind Feast started out with this concept of telling stories through dinner. This idea that the meals that we eat have some kind of significance. This idea that a single guy's meal looks a certain way when he's eating alone at home, and then maybe on a first date, the meal's arranged in a very particular way, like he's trying extra hard. I wanted Winston to move and act like a real dog, and in order to do that, we had to bring in puppies into the studio to observe and to play around with. Puppy days were so fun. It was amazing. I'd look up and I'd realize not only was our crew there to play with puppies, but a whole bunch of other people that weren't working on the movie either. It's amazing. Thanks for watching, and enjoy Feast. Welcome to Biggie Burger. What can I get for you? Would you like to make that a Biggie deal for 99ยข more? All right, let me read that back to you. Whoa, whoa. Yeah. Our Eye-in-the-Sky is telling me I-75 is clear all the way down to the riverfront. So pull out those bikinis, slap on that sunscreen... ...and head on down. Hello. Hey. Yeah, you coming? Yeah.

I'm a middle child, too. Really? Yes, I have an older sister and a younger brother. Do you suffer from Middle Child Syndrome? -I think I do. -Yeah. You are asking for the impossible. I know. And down and up. Those are the two requirements. Adventure and fun. Yeah, because you got to go. You've got a good idea. That's right, yeah. -100%, that's it. -Oh yeah, the same. Noon clouds.

Come on, boy. Wait. So I'm here way too late to help you celebrate and be your birthday date if I may We had fun, sort of, revisiting these characters, and finding different sides of their personalities that we didn't get to explore in the movie. We always take from our own lives. It was a story artist that reminded me what I actually did with my kids, and this was this string thing that we did at Easter. They each had a different color string, and we would start them in one room, and they'd have to follow their string, and their color all through the house to find their Easter basket. Something to lead Anna through to find all the gifts that Elsa was giving her. And what a great challenge for our art director to create these two new, beautiful dresses for the girls. That was really fun. It was real visual storytelling, and that's what animation does best. Please enjoy Frozen Fever. Please enjoy Frozen Fever. Nice job. Okay, okay, here we go. So lonely. Stiff. I can't do that. Come on, Elsa. This is for Anna. You can do this. Relax! It looks great! I just want it to be perfect. Speaking of "perfect..." Check this out. Kristoff, are you sure I can leave you in charge here? Absolutely. Because I don't want anything to happen to this courtyard. What could happen? It's all set. Olaf, what are you doing? I'm not eating cake. Olaf... But it's an ice cream cake. And it's for Anna. And it's for Anna. -It's time! -It's time! For what? -Okay, you sure you got this? -I'm sure. Don't let anyone in before we're ready. -I won't. -And don't touch anything. I'm just gonna stand here. I'm probably gonna walk around a little. And keep an eye on that cake! She thinks you're an idiot. Well, clearly she's wrong. What? It's fine. I can't read. Or spell. Anna? Yeah? Happy birthday. ...to you It's your birthday. ...to me It's my birthday. Come on! It's my birthday? And it's going to be perfect because...
