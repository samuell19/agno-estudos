Transcript by rabbit_01 Are you ready? Yes. See? This is me. That's good.. And this is Bayala, our home. Where different Elven tribes used to live in harmony, with the most mythical creatures of all. The Dragons. And it was the mystical bond between Elves and Dragons that made Bayala a land of magic. Indeed. Elves looked after Dragon's eggs all year round, and each year during Dragon's Feast, Elves returned the eggs to the Dragons, so that the first thing the hatchlings would see were their majestic parents. And Dragon's gave Elves the new eggs to look after, yes. One year, Ophira, Queen of the Shadow Elves, stole all the Dragon's eggs. And to keep other tribes away from her, she also stole baby Sun Elf Princess Surah. As Ophira became more and more powerful, the magic of Bayala began to fade. And the wilt appeared? Yes, the wilt appeared. Slowly destroying the land. Meanwhile, Surah grew up in the Shadow Castle. But she yearned to get back to her family, so one day, with the help of her Shadow Elf friends, she made a break for it! Surah... Find them! Search the castle! Surah, this way. Halt! Halt in the name of Queen Ophira. Oh, don't eat us! We taste terrible! - Ladies. - Thanks, Jaro. Oh no! - Halt! - No! - Surrender! - Never. Surah, no, no. You can't control it. Oh... No, no. No! Nuray. Gotcha. - Nuray! - You can't help her. No! I have to save her. - Get them. - Fly! I'll come back for you. I promise. Run all you want. But where will you go? Soon Bayala will be mine. For years I've dreamed of coming home, But always with Nuray at my side. You must come with me, Jaro. You know that Shadow Elves like me aren't welcome here. But I'll come back, I promise. Surah? Surah! Is it really you? It's me, Sera. Your twin sister. I thought you were lost to us forever. But, how did you escape Ophira? Your wings! You were a prisoner for so long, you grew Shadow Elf wings. But they're only wings. You are my sister. Welcome home. Five years have passed since Surah returned home. And Bayala is a divided land, where magic is fading. Elves rarely get together, and no one knows, if there are any Dragons left. This is where I come in, isn't it? - Yes, you do. Because sometimes the smallest of things can bring about the greatest change. - Child and wave. - Leaf and stone. Each is different. All is one. ♪ To guide to soar to be ♪ ♪ A joy to feel so free ♪ ♪ My spirit stays strong at night ♪ ♪ If my sisters could only see ♪ ♪ It's all night where I belong ♪ ♪ I'm jumbled up, lost and wan ♪ ♪ There's nothing to be done ♪ ♪ But fly on toward the sun ♪ So, where are you? Sera says you once grew here. But not anymore. The wilt has taken it all. Huh? A Dragon! Kuack, it's a Dragon! Look at it! Wow, that means... they still exist! Welcome to the Realm of the Rens Elves! I mean, welcome to the Realm of the Sun Elves. I'm sorry. I don't understand you. It was a Dragon! Wow! The Dragon's breath, it healed the plants.. He's brought his magic! Sera's head will explode when she sees this! Oh my. The coronation! Quick, Kuack! I had that dream again. Someone calling to me. Good morning, spider. Godd morning, dear old tree. Piuh? Piuh. Are you alright? What's that weird sound? That's the sound I hear in my dreams. Oh. A rock? Talking... whispering? Oh my wings! It's a talking rock. This is the perfect gift for a new queen. No one has ever had a pet rock that actually does something. Yes, finally. Time to fly. Flap! Flap! Flapitty-Flap! Oh my wings! Oh! Piuh, quick! Look out! Special queen gift coming through! Woah! Watch out! Woah! Shadow elf! Hide! Oh my wings. It's her! Surah! Piuh. Look. It's her. That's not a Shadow Elf. That's Princess Surah, you bunch of scaredy Rainbow Elves. Seriously. This is like Modern Sun History 101. The Princess has feathers, because she was in the Shadow Realm, when she was old enough to grow wings. Don't you know? Surah is the only Sun Elf who can fly at night. The only one. I wish I was her. Yay! What a morning, Kuack! Look at it! - Good morning. - Morning. Morning. 'Scuse me. Hello! - Good morning. - Good morning. - What... - Thank you! Children, where are you? Breakfast is ready. I'll catch you! Oh no, the wilt - it's here. Breakfast time, my little plants. Everybody gets a big drink of fresh water. And here's some for you. And you. Oh, you've become so pretty! Wow, look at you! There you go. Some more for you as well... It's you, Surah. Showing off! Flying at night again huh? - Here Sera, I brought you a... - Surprise! - You're amazing! - Amazing! Fire Rose! I thought the wilt had taken it all. It did. But, boy, have I got something to tell you! Ah! It's no Dragonfeast, but the Coronation will be delicious. - Watch out! - Coming through! Don't spill the muffins! Wait, Feya burnt her hand! Ow, oh, oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. Let me help. This will heal your hand, but my sister's wings won't change, no matter how long you stare at them. - Oh, I didn't mean... - Shh. Let me concentrate. There. All better now. Wow! Thank you, Sera. Come on! Sorry, forgot breakfast! I feel no more ready to be a Queen today, than I did a year ago. A year of mourning for the King, then the eldest must ascend the throne. You know the rules. There is so much to deal with. Ophira's power is on the rise, while our kingdom's magic fades. The wilt can't be stopped. And the Elven Tribes! They act like unruly children, trying to get their parents attention. Eyela! Surah saw a Dragon! - I'm not in the mood for jokes, Sera. - It's not a joke! Tell her! I believe it's the male called, Antylar. - Listen, little elf... - Marween, not 'little elf'. Sorry Marween, no rocks allowed at the Coronation.. Also, no yarn, no bad breath, no cantaloupes... and, eh, what was the other one? Ahh, fingerless gloves? Right. No fingerless gloves, oh yeah. But definitely no rocks. It's not just a plain rock. It's a talking rock. Can't you hear it? - No we can not, because... - ...rocks don't talk. Duh? Fine. If I can't take my rock, then I'll just leave it here. Au! My tender tootsies! See you at the Coronation! Attention! Child and Wave. Leaf and Stone. Each is different. All is one. Child and Wave. Leaf and Stone. Each is different. All is one. Long live the new Queen of the Sun Elves, Queen Eyela! Long live the Queen of the Sun Elves! - Long live Queen Eyela! - Long live the Queen! - Who was that? - What was that? Ahem! This bracelet, given to me by my father, represents the Sun Elf Tribe. It belonged to a Princess. Now that I am Queen, my sisters, Surah and Sera will wear the Sun Charm. And, so... Stay behind me, my Queen. We must leave! Everyone hurry! Hide! Oh! Get away from my face, you dirty bird! No. Never again. The beaded raven is Munyn, Ophira's bird. What he sees, Ophira sees. Did someone forget to invite the Queen of the Shadow Elves to the Coronation? Am I not one of the Royals? Why do you fear me, when all I seek is my rightful place leading all of Bayala. Yes, of course, Aunt Ophira. - Isn't it always about you? - Of course not, dear. Some day it will be all about you. Thanks to me. Munyn. That's enough for now. Oh. Oh! Oh no. Oh, my wings. My talking rock! Is everyone alright? Oh my ice! I'm afraid this may only be the beginning. I'll see if anyone was hurt. Sorry I'm late! Looks like we missed a pretty wild Coronation, Lykos. Jaro! Jaro? The Jaro? - Surah! - You came! How could I not? I wouldn't have missed it for all the Elves in the world. Any news from Nuray? I haven't seen her since the night we freed you. I'm hardly welcome at Shadow Rock Castle. Or in any of the Elven kingdoms, for that matter. Ahem. - Oh! It's a Shadow Elf. - Look at his wings! Good wishes on this day of your Coronation, Queen Eyela. Elves, this is Jaro. He saved Princess Surah from Ophira. Treat him as a friend of the Sun Elves, and as the hero he is. Marween, are you alright? No. Those rotten birds made me break my talking rock. You're okay. You're strong. You're a rock! Huh? You're a rock with a scaly leg? Not another word. Stay here. We have to clear the hall. Now. Well, if you knew you were a Dragon, why didn't you tell me? I wou;dn't have run around babbbling about talking rocks, like an idiot. She understands Dragon! Father spoke of rare Elves like her. Excuse me, your highnesses. Nugur wants to come out of his shell. - No! - No! If the Dragon's parents aren't the first thing it sees, it's magic may be broken. - What is she thinking? - Shh! Be patient, Sera. Hm, a Dragon's Feast! Yes! It's the perfect time. Yes! - We need the Elven Royalty. - And they're all here. Except for one. The Shadow Elves. Yes. And I doubt Ophira will come. We don't need Ophira. We need Nuray. She's a Princess and a rightful heir to the throne. Oh, Nugur! Is he alright, Marween? Nugur thinks, the Dragon's Feast means, roasted Dragon. No, no. Please tell him the Dragon's are the guests of honour. And not the main dish. The Dragon's Feast must begin at noon of the Summer Solstice at Solstice Rock. - You have a plan? - I do. This is Solayis. You will go to the Barrow Mountains, where the trails splits. One way goes to Shadow Rock Castle, the other to Dragon's Peak. I hate leaving Lykos behind, - But we can fly there in a days time. - No flying. You'd be easy targets for Ophira's storm spells. Surah and Jaro will go to Shadow Rock for Nuray. Sera and Marween will take Nugur to Dragon's Peak. Wait! You want me to go? Really? Do you know another Elf who can speak with Dragons? That's my plan. What d'you say? I say we have four days to do this. - And we should've started yesterday! - You four prepare for your journey. I'll speak with the tribal leaders, and convince them to join us. Then we will follow you, and meet at Solstice Rock. As you travel, you must keep Nugur out of sight of Ophira and her raven. She will do anything to have him. A Dragon and its magic would only make her more powerful. Kuack! Come on! Oh, I think I'll walk. Okay? Don't be afraid. They're big, but they would never hurt you. Touch your heart, and bow, when you approach them. We ask for their help, we never demand it. Ha-Hallo? May I? Thanks. You're so kind. Oh, my wings! Thanks! Fates willing, we'll meet at Solstice Rock in four days. - We will be there with Nuray. Hyah! - Hyah! Ahh, hyah, I guess? If we ride like Marween, we will be there in about an hour. Hm. Your Majesty? Queen of Ice Elves. This place is hotter than my mother's kitchen. How you can stand it, I'll never know. Umm... Yes? Oh, now don't go worrying yourself about it, sugarlips. I'm sure your pretty little head can't do anything about it, can you? Ahh... No. Well, ain't that a shame. This has been a lovely little Coronation, sister. But I really must be going back to my delectably chilly castle, built from our finest eternal ice. I have heard your eternal ice is melting away faster than your magic, sister. Who told you that? Was it the Forest Elf King? At the rate his trees are dying, he's barely got a forest to be king of, old stick for brains. Alright. I'll lay it on the table. We have been having a little problem with our ice. Nothing to worry about, I'm sure. Just a lack of... mm.. magic. Possibly. What if I told you, we are going to have a Dragon's Feast? A what? Oh my ice! I can't even remember the last Dragon's Feast. Oh, that's a lie. I can I looked fabulous. But I barely even remember how it's done. Oh, that's a lie. I do. Maybe. And, ooh, have I just got the coolest little number to wear. But Eyela, darling, the question is: Do you know how to host such an important shindig? ♪ Grab your pouch, your cloak, your bravest smile ♪ ♪ We ride before the sun is high ♪ ♪ No time for stalling, adventure is calling ♪ ♪ So venture into your shadows, let's fly ♪ ♪ Our future hangs by a thread ♪ ♪ Full of danger and dread ♪ ♪ But together we'll conquer whatever's ahead ♪ ♪ There's nothing quite as filling as a quest ♪ ♪ Just like our road, how hard could it be? ♪ ♪ With loving friends by our side ♪ ♪ We know that we'll turn the tide ♪ ♪ We'll sing a song that goes on past the end of the ride ♪ ♪ Past the end of the ride ♪ It'll be just a minute, Nugur. Piuh's catching your supper. No, I don't know how you'll eat it. I guess he likes his fish roasted. It's the traditional greeting. Otherwise he won't speak or listen. Wetness to you, King of the Rainbow Elves. Oh... Wetness to you, Queen of the Sun Elves. Now that we have wet each other, may we speak about a matter of great importance, to Bayala? Is this about the Dragon's Feast? If so, the Rainbow Elves are with you. How did you know? Oh. The Ice Elf Queen told me. My goodness, it's been so long since we've had a really good Dragon's Feast. Cakes, drinks, dancing, prizes. All the good stuff. Maybe we should have special hair painting for it. Wouldn't you look lovely with rainbow hair? - You can't paint the Queen's hair. - Why not? Well, ahh... It's against the... Rules! Rules. Pah! And besides: Are you sure you know all the rules? Toodles! Ah, well. That went well. Bring me the King of the Forest Elves. Making camp, are we? What're they really up to? Perhaps they want to have a good time with friends, Aunt Ophira? - Other Elves do that, you know. - Of course! The two Sun Elf Princesses are having a nice little picnic with my enemy, Jaro. What else could it be, but a party? Why don't we shake things up, and see what falls out. Shall we? Hey there. Have you ever made a fire? I can't say that I have, but we can always try my Fire Rose. Fire Rose? What's that? Wouldn't you like to know? That's.. err.. great first try. Run! Hide! Everyone! Marween! - Surah! - No, wait. Marween! Get down! Run! Surah's hiding something. You two were close once. What do you think she could be planning? I haven't seen Surah in five years. How should I know? Of course. Silly me. I'll just have to ask Surah. If she survives. No! - Oh my wings! - Keep Nugur hidden. We've got to go. Now! Go, everybody go! No... I can't do this. I can do this. Go! No. No. No! Not again! No! Marween! Surah, watch out! What was that? It's okay, Nugur. It's all over. You're safe. - Are you okay? - We're both fine. - Sera, are you alright? - You did the Storm Spell? No Sun Elf has ever been able to perform the Storm Spell. - How did you do that? - We have to leave. Now. A Dragon's Feast? Hm... Well, the Forest Elves could be a part of that. Thank you so much. We'll be start... Call me mad, but don't you need Dragons for a Dragon's Feast? Well yeah... Of course. I mean... And, do you have Dragons? Well, Ahh... yes? Will there be... dancing? Yes! - Dancing! - More dancing than you've ever seen! Falaroy will do his special Dragon Dance. Huh? Heh? Oh, jolly! Forest Elves are quite partial to the busting of a move, and the getting on of the groove. I'll bring this up with the tribe, of course. But it sounds like you have everything in order. Come on, talk to me. It's the most powerful of all magics. And you can do it! How could you hide that from me? I'm your sister. Your twin. Hey! What's wrong? Don't you see it? It's evil! - I'm sorry. I didn't want... - Forget it, Sera. The horses! Now you decide to run! Come on, honey. The eastern path will be cooler, and therefore much more comfortable. For us, that is. Maybe. But the western route is much more scenic, all the beautiful colours, the way my face looks when the sunrise strikes it, that certain way. We are not travelling so we can see your face! The southern route is the fastest, so that's what we'll take. And where are they going? This way. It's my considered royal opinion, that we should follow them. Fine, fine. Follow the Sun Elves. Hyah! This way, Rainbow Elves! Keep together, everyone. A Processsion? A Fiest? Is Eyela planning a Dragon's Feast? How could she do that? Munyn! Watch Surah and her little group. I need to know what they're up to. Sera! Isn't that Fog's Breath? Fog's Breath! No way. It disappeared with the Dragons. - I'll get it for you. - Surah. Wait for me. Surah! Surah, where are you? Where did she go? Oh my. What's down there? - Oh, wow. - These are beautiful. - Fine garlands from these. - The Dragons'll like it too. We don't have time for this. What are they doing? Making garlands and wreaths for the Dragon's Feast, I believe. Elves! First, let me say, I truly appreciate your... fine craftmanship. But time is of the essence! To make this brief: Get on the path, and let's get going. Well said, my Queen. - What? No garlands? - Waddya mean, no garlands? What do you mean, no garlands. What are you talking about? I'm not so sure she knows how to hold a feast. How do you hold it without garlands? She's gonna need our help, isn't she? - Surah! - Surah! Surah! What is this place? Hello. Would you all care for some tea? - Hah? - Magus Bilara! The Magus Bilara? The Teacher of Magic? Welcome to my home. Huh. But where are they? You've felt it, haven't you? Your magic grows stronger the closer you are to Nugur. Marween, you didn't notice, because your bond with Nugur already existed. All your life the egg has been hidden under your home tree. You're a very special Elf, Marween. Vital magic oozes from you. That's why you understand animals. Nugur, Piuh, this isn't a game. Please, no! Take it easy. Be careful! His shell must cover his eyes until he can see his parents. It's lucky Ophira doesn't know about Nugur. But, what about the Dragon's eggs? I've always wondered. Did Ophira hide them? Did she destroy them? In all my years at Shadow Rock Castle, I never saw a single egg. I have no idea if they were destroyed or hidden. Ophira's always been a smart one. And very creative. And evil, just like her magic. Child, nothing is good or evil on its own. Look. I could use this to grind seeds for medicine. Or I could weigh down a letter in the wind. Or... Or I could do this! It's the same with magic, it's how you use it that makes the difference. There is something important I need to show you. The stone in the center is called the Blue Eye. Our ancestors came here to rest and reflect. They believed that the Eye helped them see things from a new perspective. I saw the Storm Spell when I grabbed your arm. It came from the heart, but you feared it. It's Ophira's. The Storm Spell is dangerous and evil. It's yours too. Do you believe you're evil? No. - Are your wings evil? - I don't know. Let go, my dear. Across the lake is the path to Dragon's peak. And some distance later, you can turn off to Shadow Rock Castle. Oh my wings, Surah! A unicorn, look! I see it, Marween. This is amazing! I never thought I'd see a real unicorn! She's beautiful, Bilara! Now, now girls. You can admire her later at Solstice Rock. We all have urgent tasks to attend to. Bilara's right. We must hurry. Munyn! Nugur! You leave him alone! Quick! Get on the boat! Go! Ophira knows your secret. I will see you tomorrow at Solstice Rock. A Dragon. A newly hatched Dragon. Munyn almost had it. They are having a Dragon's Feast. Are you going, Aunt Ophira? I'm sure you'll be the life of the party. There will be no Dragon Feast if I have the Dragon. They will bring it to me, whether they want to or not. There. You look fierce. That stupid Munyn won't dare mess with you again. A storm's brewing. That looks like Ophira's work. Do you think Surah and the others are okay? The footsteps lead away from here. They should be good. Another of Ophira's tricks. I can't see my hand in front of my face. Elves! Stand where you are! Even one step, and you'll be lost in this fog forever. Ow! My nose! It itches! Scratch it then, as long as you stay where you are. To be honest, I'm having a little trouble finding it. - Oops! There it is. - That's my nose, you clod! You know, we could just ride off, and they'd never find us. Don't tempt me. Surah, Surah! More in the sail. The wind is pushing us off course. We're headed for the Shadow Realm. It's Ophira's Storm Spell. I won't let you hurt Surah. I don't need your permission. This is about our kingdom. Your future! Chain her up. Our boat is not strong enough for such a storm. Surah! You know what you must do! You can do it. Everyone. Hold on! Here we go! The Storm Spell. Does she think she can beat me, with my own magic? No! Surah! Surah! Oh no! Hold on tight! What on earth was that? No time to think. We have to move quickly. Elves! You can move now. Ohh. Oh, what a relief. Finally, I can scratch my nose. - Is everyone alright? - Where are we? Well, I've got good news, and bad news. The good news is, we're okay, the bad news is, our boat is wrecked, and we're in the Shadow Realm, far beyond Dragon's Peak, and... Ophira knows we're here. We're trapped. This is how the Storm Spell is done, Surah. They're in my realm now. - My realm, my advantage. - You underestimate Surah. You underestimate me. Munyn! Make sure they go nowhere but to me! Ophira has made it impossible for us to take Nugur to Dragon's Peak. And Munyn and his ravens, will not allow us to go anywhere except where Ophira wants us to go. It's all over. Isn't it? We've lost. No! Can't we do something? Please! Nugur will never see his mother and father? There may be a way. But it will be dangerous. We need as many of us as possible to get Nuray from Ophira's clutches. And... Marween will have to take Nugur to Dragon's Peak by herself. Surah! What are you thinking? Dragon's Peak is now twice the distance we planned for. - And Marween is only a child. - You're right. - Forget I even said... - I'm not a child! Bilara said it, I'm a special Elf. And none of you can understand Dragons. I'm the only one. You were my age when you escaped Ophira, that was more dangerous than going to Dragon's Peak. This is my world too. And I'm here to save it. She does have a point. Huh? But we're forgetting one thing: the ravens. I haven't forgotten. All we need is a distraction. You. You are my brave bird. And there is no other bird who could do this. This is the last of my Fire Rose. Don't let it fall, until we give the signal. Here Kuack. This herb will make you stronger, faster, and braver than any raven. Quickly. We have to do this before dawn. Kuack will need the cover of darkness. Let's hear you're call. Perfect. Do you have any more of that stronger faster braver herb you gave Kuack? Sure, it's everywhere. It was a blade of grass. He just needed some encouragement. See you at the Fiest! Munyn, stop this. I can't see them. Munyn, leave that bird alone. Get your eyes on Surah. Find them! Ooh, my! Oh my wings! You've got to be the world's heaviest baby. Oh, why didn't you tell me you were ready to fly? Look everywhere! Hm, why are you hiding from me? Do they plan to sneak in and...? Oh! Take you! Oh, of course! Take me? Why do you say that? You and Surah could never fool me. Why would they come for me when you will do? A Princess and a Dragon Feast in one fell swoop. It's what I would have done. Shadow, take my message to Surah. Hello, Surah! My. Haven't you grown. Are you a Sun Elf, or a Shadow Elf? It's hard to tell, with those wings. - But... - We'll chat later. Let's talk trade. Nuray for your Dragon. It's as simple as that. We can't do that. We couldn't if we wanted to. We don't have Nugur. Ophira doesn't know that. I can... I can do this! I know I can. Woah! Don't cry, Nugur. I'm okay. I can make it. Oh no. One way or another, we will get you to your parents. We will! We have arrived. Welcome. Magus Bilara! What're you doing here? I am here to help you, child. There is no time to lose. We must prepare the Dragon's Feast. You heard her. Let's get moving! Amazing! I haven't felt like this in ages. You know... important! I must say, we had forgotten how to work together as one. Then let us continue, together, for Bayala. Surah, don't trust her! We're here. Honour your deal. You should've listened to your precious Nuray. Guards! Now, give me the Dragon. And I might let you live. Join us, Ophira. Bayala can be united again. The magic will return to all of us. 'All of us'. 'All of us'? You're not worthy of magic. I have been studying its secrets for a lifetime, under the Shadow Realm. You? You're just a talented amateur. The Shadow Realm demands the Dragon. Give it to me! As you wish. Hm? Tell me! Where is the Dragon? Never! No matter. Your twin's eyes told me everything. Munyn! Fly to Dragon's Peak. Get me that baby Dragon. Oof! Finally. You two wait here and be quiet. I'll see if anyone's home. Okay? Hello? Oh, no, no, no. I'm not an enemy. I'm a friend. F-R-I-E-N-D. Of Nugur. Oh, my wings! We did it! Piuh, we really did it! Take them. Put them in the darkest dungeon. You and your sisters still lose, this key. I will have that Dragon. And you will not have a Dragon's Feast. Oh, yes they will! You dare? Yes, we do. Get the guards! You cannot defeat me with the Storm Spell. Watch me. Well, I was hoping for a nicer meeting. I feel I already know you. Duck! Well done, Lykos. Woah! Munyn! Have you found my Dragon? Ah! No! - Surah! - Can you stand? Oh, okay. Oh. We better step back, Lykos. No! This can't be happening! Yeah! No! Get down! No! Wow! - As Marween would say... - Oh my wings! But... what are these? - Are they... - Dragon's Eggs! The sun. It's almost noon. Look! Boats approaching. Shadow Elf boats! Yay! Now this... This is the only way to fly. All welcome Nuray, Queen of the Shadow Elves! Long live Queen Nuray! As a sign of our goodwill, we have brought you precious gifts. Do you see that? Dragon Eggs! Oh my goodness! Dragon's Eggs? You... You found them! They were hidden in the bellies of Ophira's Dragon statues. The time is near. It is the twelfth hour of the Solstice. The hour of the Dragon's Feast! You'll need your strength, Marween. Tomorrow you start as the Royal Liasion to the Dragons, and apprentice to Magus Bilara. - Me? - Who else can talk to Dragons. Which other Elf scaled a mountain alone, to save her land? It's my honour to have you as my apprentice. Keep this up, and Surah will be wearing one of your feathers in her hair. But I don't have any feathers. See? Of course you don't. Just kidding. - I never thought I'd be the new Queen. - I never thought I'd have one more sister. I propose a toast. To the Royal Families and their subjects. To the Dragons. And their magic. To the heroes, who made this day possible. And, to Bayala. - To Bayala! - To Bayala! It's a new beginning for all of Bayala. In the morning, the Dragon Eggs will go to every realm of Bayala, to spread magic to all the tribes. Woohoo! Child and Wave. Leaf and Stone. Each is different. All is one. Transcript by rabbit_01
