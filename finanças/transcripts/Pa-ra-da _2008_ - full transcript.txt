It was awful! Still thinking about that kid? YES. Another gift from Ceausescu. He offered welfare to large families. Then il all fell apart. The city's full of kids who have run away from home. They till streets, sewers, stations. They call them "boskettari", sewer kids. Can anything be done for them? We try to every day, but it's not easy. - They're violent. - They fight like trapped animals. We know them all. The girl you saw is called Alina. One of the more fragile kids. Get some sleep.

If you don't like it, go away! She imitated me before. She'd make a great clown. Couldn't you have been careful? I'm tired of being a mother to you. Know how much an abortion costs? L could keep n. Another kid On the street? - I could come to your place. - Don't talk crap. Do you want to chase my clients away? - What do I do? - Mihaela, your turn! This one's good. And cheap. I'll take you to her. We split up six months ago. - When are you going back to Home? - Are you interrogating me? Of course not! - Go on, Don. - Thanks, bye. I don't know. As long as I'm needed and someone funds us. We've been fighting for 2 years. - Why do you speak in the plural? - And you? In the singular? W"? did you stay? Some places make you feel more alive. Different. This is one of them. You're here to feel different. - We're both here. - But I don't think that way. I'm hungry and Mihai's waiting for us. I'll join you later. - Will you take my case? - Yes. Thanks. They're near the bridge, platform 14. Who the fuck are you? MilOUd, the clown. What do you want? Piss Off! Get lost! Give me a drop too. - You play well. - Thanks. I come here often, they give me credit. Everything okay? He's my brother. What'll you have? - What you're having. - Two mustard and sauerkraut buns. You're not French. My mother's French. Half and half. My father's Algerian. But I've never met him. Half and half? A little bit gypsy then. - If you say so. - Why do you dress in black? Mafia guys wear black. I like black. It makes it easier to dress. Perhaps I am a bit Mafioso. Are you taking the piss or are you stupid? No, I'm your friend. What are you doing in this shithole? I like street life and maybe I'm attracted to shit. Until you drown in it. But then you learn to swim and emerge from it. L like you. But don't be an asshole. No, don't worry. Brothers. Come with me. Watch your head! - What the fuck are you doing here? - Easy! Stop that, Constantin. HO'S With me. You can sleep here. What the fuck are you doing here? Hello, Tea. I've come to sleep here. Don't you have a home? What the fuck are you doing? I'm scared to go outside. It happens to everyone the first time. Thanks. What are you doing? Get out of here! Get out of here! - Miloud, the trains are here. - What? The trains. DO you like them? I did them. - My home and my mother. - Your home? - Yes. - You like drawing. They're nice. Are you coming with us? No, I've got things to do. Cristi, here the accordion. ' Let go! - Help! Cristi, help me! Let go. Sorry. - YOU Shit! - Sorry. Don't pull me.

We were worried. - Mihai's out looking for you. - Sorry. A sleepless night for this bloody idiot! You slept with the sewer kids. What did you find out? I'll let Mihai know. You still stink of the sewer. - No, i don't. - You do. Okay, who is this guy then? He's the head Of an NGO. And like a good social worker Livia gives him a hand. - HE'S smart. - Here he is. Hi. - Everything okay? - Yes. MilOUd. - Pleased to meet you. - I'm Stephane. Elena, fetch two more beers. You're a clown and looking for a job. I'm looking for a job, but I'm not a clown. He acts the fool, but he's talented. Livia always has to clarify. Tell me what you want to do. I don't know yet, but I know I can help out. I want to help those kids. They don't give funding for good intentions. I need a written project. We need money and political goodwill. But most of all, we need the kids to agree. Or they're sent to an orphanage and escape to the streets again. - The street is their freedom. - It's mine too. - They feel safer there. - There are a lot of them. I'm happy you want to help us out. - A clown will come in handy. - Good. Livia, help him write up his project. We're in good hands! Thanks. Some pills would have been enough! You're pregnant now. Hurry up, or we won't find him. You have to take two. Hello, Stephane. Is everything okay? We have a few patients. - It's not serious? - No. Open your mouth. I like Miloud. Have you thought about the project? We're working on it. Get your hands off me! Where are you going? Vlad, what are you doing here? Hello, Tea. - Run away from the village? - My dad's here looking for work. I'm in the Brancoveanu sewers. I'm at the station. You've grown. - You were a wimp back home. - Want some? You've grown handsome. I'm always hungry. Notice anything? You're pregnant? Can I touch? You can't tell that much. - I've decided to have an abortion. - Aren't you scared? - How can I have a kid in the canal? - What about your sister? She has to work. Are you on your own? I was forgetting. Here. Thanks. Hi. This is Vlad, he's staying with us. - Does Constantin now? - Not yet. Here he is, let's go and tell him. Alina. Look, it's the music you like. Leave him, he's staying with us. - What? - Here. What a mess! What's going on? We start tomorrow . Wait, you can tell me later. I'll give you a hand, or we'll have lo look for another home.

Do you have a girl, or are you homosexual? Homosexual? I had a girl, but I don't know whether I still have one. I'll introduce you when you come to Paris. She's pretty, and nice. Do you screw? No, we make love. - Do you have a girlfriend? - Yes, Alina. - Alina? Does she know? - Of course. Of course. - No. - No. How do you put your tongue when you kiss? Your tongue? You're just a kid! Shithead! I'll tell everyone you're queer! Is that the way to treat a friend? - Don't laugh. - I'm not laughing. Sorry. Sit down here. What do you want to know exactly? How you put your tongue. How you put your tongue? It's difficult. These are public baths, right? Yes, but they can't come in. Ir they pay a ticket, they can come in. Only the boys, girls tomorrow. All right. Eight.

I said I don't have any money! MilOUd. I saw you go past. How are you? Il all looks the same. Will you walk me some of the way? I've been doing this job for twenty years. It's a slow process. Not because of us. You've only been here a month. What did you expect? Sometimes everything seems possible. You give it all you got, but then it seems that you've done nothing. That's what you think. Perhaps they don't want to change. Perhaps the secret is to keep your distance. If you climb onto the roof, you can see the square better. - Understand? - YES. You'll change your views. Come to dinner one evening. My wife will be pleased to see you. Okay. Thanks for the thought. Us on the top of the building, and them down below. And MilOUd was imitating them. Cristi was trembling like a puppy. What the fuck are you doing? How can you live this way? Even animals behave better. This place stinks! Can't you smell it? It turns your stomach. Makes you sick. I'm asking for a bit of respect. Not for me, for yourselves. Understand? Who the fuck are you to tell us how to live? Don't be a pain, get lost! Do you want to kill me? Go on! Come here. Do you want to hit me? Look. - Get out! - You don't scare me. Do you know why? Because I'm crazier than you are. Much crazier! Okay? If there's no respect, goodbye then. Has he left? I don't know. Why was he pissed off? What is this respect? You're such idiots! He's the idiot. He's right, we're revolting. It's Catalin's fault for peeing. He pissed his pants. Tell him to go back to Miloud. Miloud is right. we are disgusting Drop it! We did this to Miloud. Gift to all of us. Almost all of us. Thank you. If we forgive all the time... You do not get it. What else can they do? - This is a call for help. - What do you know it is? Give them an example... I'm just a street clown You're right, you are not a social worker. You will be insensitive, professional. You need to be able to do something of bureaucracy. - This is my job. - Susanna you! You're not just a clown. You know it's not like that. If you were, you would already be back in Paris. Want? Thanks, I'll just have water. Why don't you help us? Better that they do it themselves. Also, it's not my sewer. That's right, this is my sewer. I kill you! What are you doing here? Salt! - I'll give you a good lesson. - Get out of here, idiot! The police are coming. What are you doing? Fuck off! Enough, enough! It is not like this. One two three. One two three. Miloud. i found this girl on the train tracks. I was alone. I had nowhere to go. What's your name? We are friends. Elena. - Where are you from? - From the field. He ran away from home. I'll let Mihai know. maybe i can find to Ellen's family. I'm sure we'll find it TRUE? The boy! The boy! I'm bleeding! Don't be afraid, it's not blood. We will take you to the hospital. - I'm scared. - Don't be afraid, take a deep breath. Vlad, give me a bag! No more bags! You need to breathe. Come on, Vlad. We will go to the hospital. The girl is giving birth! Keep breathing deeply. See you at the hospital. Silence. How are you Tea? How do you feel? Have you seen the child? They haven't taught me yet. Hopefully he doesn't look like his father. - I have to breastfeed, right? - Of course. - What will you call it? - What are you saying? How do we put it? Let it be David, like my father. Good morning. Congratulations, Tea. - I need you to bring my baby. - Don't worry, they'll bring your baby. - When can I have it? - Look, Tea. baby can't live in sewers. We clean my sewer, Isn't that right, Miloud? It's true. Tea, the baby will get sick in a sewer. I talked to the doctors. I'll tell my sister. We'll get a place. Stephane spoke with Don Guido. The nuns They will take care of your baby. I will not send my son to the orphanage! There they will beat him! It is not an orphanage. The nuns are friends of Don Guido. If you don't give the baby to the nuns, they will send him to the orphanage. If you want, you can too stay with the nuns I hate nuns! We will not go there. do not interfere in our business. You didn't grow up without a mother. - Who is there to breastfeed the baby? - You can go visit him. He's my baby, okay? And there is not more to talk! I will not give my baby! Go Go. You too, go away! Salt. Get out of here. Come on. Take. What do you think? In your house? Yeah. There are also such places in France. We used to meet in a courtyard between two buildings. I remember when I was a child. Even if not I had a family would be involved in a crime, I would be like them. Do you want to come home? No dude, are you crazy? We need to get the kids out from the sewer. That is first. We have to get them out alive. you don't know yet life on the street Children will not allow this. They are happy with the shape what are they in But you just don't want for them, right? You are very assertive to have success. Worse. I leave everything on the table. All good? The nuns took the baby away. I'll take you there tomorrow. Otherwise, I will count you the days. That's enough. - Give me that beer! - Enough talk! Enough of nonsense! Give me a cigarette. Let's go. Have you heard? - Leave me alone. - Come on, walk. Go away! In this state, they won't give you the baby alive! Salt! The baby is not yours! What are you looking at? Is there someone? Open the door! - Open! - What do you want? - I want to see my baby. - Look to you! I want to see David. So quit the drugs. Open that door, bitch! Uh... po...! What do you want? You are only 13 years old. if you do that, they will never give you your baby. I'm sorry, it's like that. You need to think about it. Do you want to think about it or not? Respect! Don't keep moving. They took Elena! She was here just a while ago two minutes! The police took her away. Excuse me. A friend of his took a girl from our group. - Show me your papers. - My documents are fine. - I want to see them. - I am a French citizen. Where are your documents? Where did they go?

However, the investigation continues. We inform your association. Your good Miloud has benefited from it! What are you saying? - He whistled at the children. - Slander!

Yes, but Miloud is not an employee fixed of our association. He is in a project about children of the sewers With the assistance of an instructor Italian from the Romanian Social Service. Our association works Mainly on other projects. Mr. Oukili, I have a question. why stay in the sewer at night? Do you know of a better way to gain the trust of children? - Then ask them to testify. - I don't want to involve them. The consequences can be serious. Think about it. - Nothing happened? - What? couldn't they have understood wrong a word, a movement? You already know how I am. You saw how I work. Well well. Maybe it's best return to France. Well, then I'll go back to France. Thank you. Excuse me. Come with me. Miloud! Scatter, go away! Whatever you want... But I think it would be a wasted effort. I am personally trying to Don't deal with job vacancies. I'm going to speak to them. - They'll be eating now. - Better! Thanks for taking care of me like your brother. I did what tasted good.

I knew you would do it. I always play a winning horse. Do you never take off your shoes? Is it fun to have sex with a clown at least? Sorry, I'm a little confused. Or you can't sit still happy or depressed. There is no middle ground. Shall I close the curtain? Miloud, get out! - What's going on? - Come on! - Wait! - Hurry up! Hello hello? Miloud is calling.
