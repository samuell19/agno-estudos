It looks like my math tutoring has finally paid off. - Yeah? - I got a B. Ooh, that's fabulous, honey! That's wonderful. Luke, how did you do, hon? - No B's here. - No B's here, all right. Good job. You know, Ben, I'm proud of you. Okay? You did your best, and that's all that matters. Dean's list. It's gonna be hard when I leave. Can you survive without me? Where to? A sumo wrestling camp, right? That's right. Don't I look good in a ten-pound G-string? Oh, I don't wanna hear that. - You know you like that stuff. - No, I know I hate that. - Especially you in a G-string. - You know you like that stuff. Come on, man, you're like a little lady. Let's go, put some speed on it. Oh. Somebody fight me. What? I thought this was a real gym. - Yeah, get him, Tank. - Yeah, get him! Rip that ponytail off him. Pull his hair or somethin'. Oh! Tank just got knocked out. What was that, ten seconds? Fighting's tough, right, Tank? Come on. I thought this was a real gym. - I got a hundred bucks on it. - A hundred bucks? What? - Oh, this is mine. - Oh, oh... No, no, no, too slow, second best. Don't get knocked out. Must be ladies' night in the gym. Oh, look at this guy. Oh, I'm so sorry. Ladies first. Whoa, whoa, whoa, the hundred dollars. Yeah. That's what I'm talkin' about. I got that hundred dollars for that G-string. - Blood money. - Yeah, half of that is mine. Oh, no, blood money pays the bills. Yeah, you got a lot of those. Aw. What you say we fight to see who's second best, Miss Benjie? All right. Let's fight. Ben! Michael! You two in my office right now. Fellas, it does nothing to fight out there. All right, give us a fight. Michael, I got a fight for you. What? A fight for pretty boy? What about me? See, Nick is smart. He knows who the strong fighter is, and who the weak one is. Simmer down. Come on, Nick. I'm better than him, and you know it. I got a fight for you in the works. All right. Let's go, Luke! Way to go, Lukitus! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Goal! He's really good. - Okay? - Sounds good. Yes, sir. Luke Bernard. Hey, I'm Phillip Moore. Real Salt Lake, major league soccer. - How are ya? - Wow. I watched you guys win the Cup. Well, we've been watching you too. Listen, the coaches love you. The front office loves you. And I'm a fan. So, they sent me out to see if I could find a new striker that might be interested in playing major league soccer in Utah. You know anybody? Absolutely. Here's my card. - Thank you, sir. - You bet. - Let's stay in touch. - Yeah. Maybe we can look at flying you out to Salt Lake before the draft. - Yeah! Yeah! - Does that sound good? - Yeah, absolutely. - Hey, you like hats? - Yes, sir. - That's for you. - Thank you. - Yeah, very well done, man. - Thank you. - Pleasure to meet you. - Thank you. - We'll be in touch. Look at this! Whoa! What was up with that? Real Salt Lake. - Put it on. - Yeah, on you. - No, you gotta put it on! - You deserve it. No, come on. What's up, man? Here is all of my clothes that you were asking for. Can't take a joke? You weren't at my practice. I scored three goals. Dad was there. Of course. Never watches me fight. - Hey! - What? You know that old Plymouth Barracuda I wanted? What? - Sure, yeah. - I found one. I mean, it needs some work, but... figured maybe you and I can fix it up together. Yeah, well... ask Dad. All right, Ben, you have a nice day too, bud. That's pretty tight, huh? - Hey, Benjamin! - Hey. You're just in time. We're gonna swap out the alternator next, and the owner's manual says it's a three-Bernard job. Yeah. Yeah, where's Mom? I need to get my suit. Mom is likely inside. I tell you what, why don't I go find your mom, and maybe you can help us next week. You better get going. Don't you need time to powder that face? I can go like this and still look better than you, Ben. Uh-huh. Hey. You wanna take this baby tonight? You got it working? Yeah, well, it would if you would have helped me when I asked. You got your best bud. You told me to ask Dad. Who's behind you, Luke? Who's behind you... Okay, that's not even about me and Dad, stupid. God's behind me. Yeah, God's behind me too. Way behind me. - Good luck. - Thank you. Ben! You look... beautiful. Thank you. Here. - Daisies! - I know you love 'em. Did I screw up? Yeah, but... now you owe me. Name it. You can start with a kiss. Oh. Do I need to be worried about that guy who just hugged you? - Stop it. - What? We're all professionals. I'm sorry, I just... think about you all the time. My solo's for you. Always. My Ben. - Bye. - Bye. Whoo! Whoo! Go, Ashley! Nice outfit. You do look better than me. I know. Thank you, it was my idea. Oh. Hey, Ben. Take a look. Oh, nice! Now, that's ball and chain. - Congrats, Ashley! - Thank you! Oh, thank you. I have something special for you. Oh, I love it! Thank you so much. You're so sweet, Rebecca. So, what did you all think about my... - It was amazing. - You were the best. Thank you. Stop! Congratulations! Oh, my gosh! Okay, let's go celebrate. Like a double date. - Yes? - Yes! Okay! Okay, I'm gonna go change. I'll be right back. All right. Uh... Double date. - Yay. - Yep. So have you set a date? No, it still hasn't even hit me yet. - Right, that does happen. - Stop. Luke, what made you want to put a ring on her finger? A song told me to. Okay. So stupid! Tell them, my hubby-to-be. I wanted to get her a ring before I go pro. - Pro? - Yeah. Check it out. They say I'll go first round. Make bank. Get Mom a new house. Get Dad a new set of wheels, you know. First round? Yeah. Ben, how are you doing in fighting? Uh... My trainer Nick, he is... working on getting me a pro fight, so... It's good. Pro? Are you joking? Don't start with this. Hey, I'm legit, man. You always have to be the star. Nah, some things come naturally. Luke? Luke? Luke? Ash? Ashley? Dad. Uh... Something happened... to... Luke. He, uh... He's hurt. - Right, vitals? - Can't get a BP. Weak pulse, GCS of 3. - Pupils? - Dilated and fixed. Okay. X-rays, head and chest. Prep for surgery. Tell them five minutes. Most likely internal. Benjamin! Hey, Ben! Ben! - Ben? Ben? - Son, no, stay down, stay down. - Oh, my God. - Son, what in the world. Ben, oh, my God. Have you seen the doctor? - Did the doctor take a look at you? - Ben, look at me. - Are you the Bernards? - Yeah, yeah. Your son suffered severe brain injury. We're rushing him to surgery to remove two blood clots. - What? - But... But he'll be okay after the surgery... We have to remove a portion of his skull to allow his brain to swell. It's the only chance to save him. But he will live, right? I mean, he will live? I can't tell you what will happen. We gotta get him to surgery. - No. - Come here, sweetheart, come on. Doc? Ashley Walters, can I... May I see her? I'm sorry, you need to consult her doctor. This is a great hospital. - I know. - It's a great hospital, we know that. They're gonna do everything that they can. - Daniel Bernard? - Yeah. Yes. I'm the chaplain here at the hospital. - Chaplain Norm. - Oh, hi. I've been the chaplain here for many years. I've seen God do miracles. Benjamin! Buddy, come on. We're gonna pray for your brother. Father in heaven, we ask that you please... don't take Luke home... - Yes. - ...now. We know that he's got a lot to do here, and he's not nearly finished yet. He barely got started. And thank you so much... ...for protecting our son Benjamin... - Yes, God. - ...through this. Craniotome. Forceps. - Hey, Ben. - Hey. Why weren't you here last night? Uh, I needed to be alone. Well, the surgery went very, very well. What are you doing there? It's a blog. I set this up for Luke. Look at this. Look how many people are praying. Isn't that amazing? You really think that's gonna make a difference? You know God answers prayers. Uh-huh. Right. Benjamin. Go see your brother. I'm not ready yet. Benjamin. He needs you. He needs you. Okay, Mom. Okay. I'll go. Come on, Luke. Hey. Hey. Hi. Oh, careful with that. So, you act like there's nothing wrong. Uh... Well, I shattered my ankle. And I'm down a spleen. So... that's gonna negatively affect my organ donation ratio for sure. Uh... I brought you these so it can smell good in here. So, how is everyone else? Am I the only wimp? Uh... No. Luke's hurt real... really bad. How bad? Uh... It's bad. What about Rebecca? Uh, she... Rebecca's... No. No. No. Rebecca Seelos Reyes. To you, she was your daughter. Some, a granddaughter. A sister. A friend to many of you. I had the honor of being able to be her pastor, to love her and walk with her and see her develop and grow in her faith and become a child of God. And while our pain and our grief is real, something that's greater than our pain is the promise of God. When we know this, we don't grieve as others who have no hope. Today, we have hope. Our hope is the thing that mitigates that pain and helps us get through. My prayer for you today is that you'll feel the peace of God that passes all understanding, and that you'll know that he loves you. And there's nothing that can separate you from his love. Goin' for the record, huh? - How's your brother doin'? - I don't wanna talk about it. All right. Well, let's talk about when you're gonna fight Mike. Hmm. All right, well, that would be a short conversation. - Just like Mike. - Just like Mike. You're a fighter, right? Uh... Um... His brother and him got into a car accident. - His brother's girlfriend died. - Shut up! All right. Wow, it sounds like you're going through some stuff. Yeah, well, this is how I'm dealin' right here. Mmm. His brother may not make it. And his family's praying day and night. - Who wouldn't be? - No, there's no reason to pray. Whoever's up there, he's not doing a very good job. Let's find out. Okay, let's find out. What? What? Do you guys know what these are? Uh-oh, she got Chuck E. Cheese tokens. No, they are sobriety chips from AA people. When their best efforts fail them, they come in here. So, these are one-month chips. We get a lot of these. But you know what we don't see a lot of? What? Six-month chips. 'Cause after six months, you form a habit. Then you don't have to come in here. Girl, you trippin'. You got all those chips from tonight. Proves that nobody makes it that long. Yeah. Nobody. Okay, I'll tell you what. You take these, and if your brother recovers in six months, you bring them back in, and dinner's on the house. Fine. Fine. - Bet's on. - All right. Hey. Are Luke's eyes... They're open. His eyes are open! Luke? - Luke? - I believe they are. Praise God. - Luke? - Hey. Hey. - Hey, buddy. - He's answering our prayers. He's answering our prayers. Look, I think he's tracking our conversation. He's tracking our conversation. Hey! Hey, honey. We're all here. Ben's here, and Dad's here. We love you. Hey, Luke, it's Ben. We love you, son. - We love you so much. - Hey, hey. - There he is. - Hey. Look at those eyes, huh? Yeah. - Hi, Luke. - Go on, get in there. - I know you wanna get in there. Go on. - Let me see. - Go on, see your baby. - Hey, honey. Hey, honey. Hey. Hey. Got a real diamond here, huh? Diamond? Well, you know, diamond in the rough. Yep. Yeah, let me show you what we've done to her so far. Yeah. All the hoses were bad. Dry rot. We replaced all those. This old baby still has drum brakes, if you can believe that. So they had to go. About the only thing that's any good is the motor. Yeah, that's what surprised me. I... Tranny's bad, gotta rebuild that. - Out, in, you know. - Yeah. Well, I think two Bernards can get her runnin'. What do you say, huh? I'm sorry, buddy, what? Two Bernards can get her runnin'. Well, look, Benjamin, I'm... My heart's not in this. We need to get Luke fixed first. Hey, you wanna come see me fight tonight? It will get your mind off things. We'll see, pal. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Well, well, well, look who's ready for the big time. Yeah. Uh-huh. You okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. Hmm. Why doesn't he stay awake? He's been staying awake a little bit longer every day. - Yes. - That's right. - Okay, I mean... - He's doing good, Benjamin. All right, a little longer's, yeah, that's... - It's good. - That's good. - Hi, Doctor. - Hey, Doc. Excuse me. All right, these extended awake periods, very good sign. Let's schedule his tracheotomy for tomorrow. What? Tracheotomy, why? - It's a very standard procedure. - I don't know. - It'll help him recover faster. - No, we said no. He'll regain consciousness in 24 hours after surgery. - He'll be fine. He'll be fine. - We said no. No. No. - No. - We have to do whatever we have to do. It'll help him, Mom. Look, his eyes are open. He's awake. - Look at your son, baby. Look at your son. - Luke? It's okay, Mom. Look, he's awake. He's awake again. Luke. Hey, buddy. Hey, sweetie. Welcome home, Ash. Thank you. I got you some roses and daisies. Oh, my God. A sign. Can you tell I drew it? - No, you didn't. - You're right, I didn't. But it's the thought that counts, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Look at this little guy. - Just like you. - Oh, it's so cute. Oh, it's so good to be home. - Yeah, I bet. - I'm really tired, though. - I bet. - Yeah. - Relax. - Yeah. Speaking of relax, take you to your room? - Yeah. - Okay. - Got the bear? - Yep. - You good? - Yeah. All right. All right. I'm super... glad with how Luke's doing. Yeah. I mean, look at me. Can you believe I'm home already? I'm looking. And I'm liking. Even with this beat-up body? Oh, come on. - Your body is awesome. - Ben. You gotta take me out. All right. Where to? Let's go to church on Sunday. Church? Yeah. Church. All right. Church. So, I'd like you to join me in prayer today. If you would, bow your heads. Because we're your children, God, we come to you boldly. And, Lord, as we come to you boldly, we pray for those who need your comforting presence and healing power. And, Father, we agree with the Bernard family. We agree with Daniel and Kathy and Benjamin, and we believe you and we pray for a complete recovery of Luke. Lord, we ask today, open his eyes. - Restore him completely. - Ben. It's about my fight. Heal his body, we pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Okay, buddy, it's time to get up. It's time to wake up. Son. - Luke. - Luke, it's time to wake up. Luke, honey, can you hear us? - Wake up, son. - Daniel. - No! Wake up! - Daniel. Luke, now! All right, you know the deal. Protect yourselves and obey my commands. Let's go! Fight! The winner, Benjamin "The Favorite" Bernard! Are you giving him more drugs? Luke doesn't even drink. Nurse... no more. We don't want you to sedate him anymore. - Stop. - I'll talk to his doctor. You can talk to his doctor all you want, but we would like you to ask him not to sedate our son anymore, please! I don't get it. How long is he gonna be like this? Benjamin, we have thousands of people praying. We're not gonna give up hope. We're not. God can heal him. I believe that. What? What God? He hasn't done anything. Don't be ridiculous, okay, Benjamin? Of course, he has. You're afraid you're gonna lose your precious Lukitus. - Ben, stop it! Stop it! - Oh, Benjamin. We love you. We love you very much. We just want him better. We want him to recover. What if he doesn't recover? Huh? What then? Is God still good? Huh? Tell me that. Tell me that. It's me. It's me. Hi, Nikki. Hey, Kathy. How are you holding up? As well as can be expected, I suppose. We have thousands of people praying for you. Just focus on Luke, and let us know if you need anything. Nikki... can I ask you to pray for something that I can't include in the blog? What's that? Ben. Dear God, I lift up Luke right now, and I pray for complete healing over his body. I pray for Dan and Kathy that you would encourage them in this time. And I lift up Ben. Please help Ben. Heal him, Lord, spiritually, that he would come to know your love. All right. I'm cutting you off. No. No, no, no, no. No, I'm tapping you out. - Calling you a cab. - No. My... My... My brother... he survives, first round. But now... he won't wake up. Wake up! It's been what? Two weeks? Everything's stupid. It's just so stupid... No, it's stupid to give up this early. A rare chip came in this week. Six-month blue chip. The guy said he wouldn't be seeing me again. You are giving up too soon. Ladies and gentlemen! Clear the way for Benjamin... "The Favorite" Bernard! Rare chip. Rare chip. Cab's on its way. - Yeah, I'll get it. - You sure? - Is that Ben? - Ben? Hey, I'll see you in a little bit. - Yeah. - Okay. Ben? Hon? Wake up. - Hey. Hey. - Oh, Mom. - Have you been here all night? - Okay, Mom, I'm okay. Oh, Ben, you reek. You need a shower. Okay. Okay. Just give me, give me a minute. Benjamin, go get some coffee, hon. Okay. How's Ben? He's hungover. Hungover. What's this? No, no, I don't want to see that. Son. What is that? The hospital bill. We're not covered for it. What? We're not covered? Well, no, we're covered, we're just not, we're not that... that covered. Can I see it? - No. - Hey, Ben. Hon, don't worry about that, okay? Don't worry about that. God's gonna provide for us. He will. He will. He will. Daniel? Luke? Luke, hon? - He's awake? - Luke? - Daniel! - He's awake! Hey! Hi, honey. Hey, buddy. - Hey. - I can't believe it. Where have you been? It's Mom and Dad and Ben! Hey, hey, Luke. - Hey, pal. - Hi, honey. - We're here, we're all here. - Where you been? Luke? Hey. All right. So up. And down. Just like that. Go ahead. How about the leg? - Go up. And down. - Ben. What are you doing? I'm moving his arms and legs around to... The doc says that they need to see him have intentional movement, - and not just twitches, and... - Right. So I'm moving him, trying to get him to move on his own, but... but he's not. It just... I don't know what to... What... He did it. That was awesome! Ash, go get a doctor or nurse. - Right. - Go! Yes! Yes! Luke, move your leg again. Come on. Come on, Luke, cross your leg again. Do this one, go, just... up and back. Do it just like that. Come on, you can do it. Come on, Luke. Come on. You can do this. Cross your legs. Hey, guys. Intentional movement? Yeah, he brought his legs up and he crossed it. Now he's not moving anymore. Just like that. Yeah, that looks intentional to me. - Yeah. - Yeah! Whoa. Whoa. That is over-the-top intentional movement. So, Luke. Doc? How? How can he move up like that with a broken back? Maybe you need to do more X-rays. Yeah. We'll look into that. - Hey, Mom. - Hi, kiddo, hi! Hey, I brought you some lunch. Thank you, thank you. Just put it right there for me. - It's lunchtime. - I know, I appreciate it. I brought something for you. Recognize this? - Huh? Look at this guy. - Yeah? No. It's okay. Hey, it's okay. The doctors say he's making progress. He is. He is. - Good. - Just give it time. - Let's get him fixed. - Give it time. What else do you have? Oh, my goodness, look at this. Oh, my goodness, look at this. What about that? Do you recognize that? Huh? Do you remember that day? You recognize me. You recognize me. You recognize me. He's coming back. He is coming back, Mom. - He's coming back. - Thank the Lord. - Yeah. - Complete recovery. Yeah. Complete. Who's it... I think he's trying to talk. - What'd you say? - What? Who is that? - I think it's the... - The trach, yeah. Cover it up. Who is that? - Me? - Her? Ashley. I'm Ashley, Luke. What... - Ashley. - Ashley. - It's okay. - He doesn't remember. It's okay. It's okay. Ooh. That's gonna cost you, champ. Ben, you need to work on your submissions. Why submit when you can just knock someone out? You wish. You gotta be a well-rounded fighter to go pro. Come over, let me show you this move real quick. Down there right quick. Man, aren't you too old for this? Was I too old when I sat you down with that body slam last week? - You got lucky. - Then get your butt on down here then. All right, first, grab the hands of the person when you pull them up, right? Pull the hands up, see? Knock 'em off balance. Next step, you bring your arm till you get the tricep. Take this hand and push his head over. I'm old. I can't be spinnin' like a turtle shell. So now I pull my legs over the top. Now I'm in this position right here. You're tryin' to pull the arm out of the socket. Arch your back and apply pressure! This is a good one for you. You pull real hard. Ain't that old, am I? Honey, it's the scout from Real Salt Lake. I need to take it. I'll meet you in there in a few minutes. Hi. Hello? Mr. Bernard. Phillip Moore, Real Salt Lake. I just got the news about Luke. How's he doing? Um... to be honest with you, it's a miracle that he's made it this far. And... I don't know what I can tell you about his soccer career. I am so, so sorry to hear that. Listen, for what it's worth... Luke was going to be our number one draft pick. First round draft pick, that's... that's fantastic. Very proud of him. Look, it's been tough... - Now, let's get you out of the chair. - Hey! - All right. Be careful. - On the bed. They said to move slowly. They said to move really slow. Take it easy, not fast. - Luke, Luke, Luke! - I just wanna get out of here! - No, no, no. Daniel! Daniel! - Luke! - Why... - Luke, you can't do this! Over here, come on. Hey! Son! You've got to go through rehab! I don't know why he's doing this. - You're gonna... - Let me out! - Let me out! - Son. Son! Listen to me. It's all part of the process. They said that a brain injury is like knocking over a filing cabinet. You have to put the files back in the right folders. I hate you! I hate you! Daniel, I can't stand this. The nurses said that he would likely be angry. It's all right. I understand you don't mean that, son. I understand. Just right here. It's all right. It's okay. I think I'd like a little bit of brain trauma. You know, Benjamin, if you're not gonna help, then don't be here, all right? If you're gonna be here, be here! - All right, I'm gone. - Benjamin! Hey. Hey. - It's okay. - Look at me. Look at me. Think of all the stress your dad is going through. - I keep messing up! - Yeah, you messed up. Now you need to work it out. You don't know everything that's happened, okay? I do know that you need to figure it out with your dad. Yeah, well, it's figured out. I know what I need to do. What is this? It's just a reminder... of something else I need to do. - That's it. - Okay. After several X-rays, we find his vertebrae to be stable. Stable. You say that. What does that mean? Stable means we can no longer find breaks in his vertebrae. So he's healed. Well, all I can say is that we can no longer find breaks. He's healed. Which means we can now take the braces off. Luke, you're healed. - You're healed. - Hug your son. God. But not too hard. Do you hear that? Yeah. What's going on over there? Oh, that guy? He's just some promoter from one of the title fights. You scheduling a title fight? - He already has. - Who are you? Benjamin "The Favorite" Bernard. You want the best to fight for the title, right? Of course, but Michael's won his last four fights in the region. But I'm better. There's no way Miss Benjie Bernard is better than me. I'll fight. Let's prove it. Yeah, us too. Let's fight! Won't prove who's the best unless we have other fighters. All right. Get... get other fighters for a tournament fight. This is gonna make the title fight even bigger. - Yeah. - The two of you. I'll find two other fighters. $2,500 to fight, $10,000 in a grand prize for the winner. All right. Here's the starting line. We'll get you out, one second. Just hold on a second. - Dad, get... - I got it, I got it. - Can you get it? - Yep. I'll help him up, all right. - And up. - Easy. All right. You ready? And go! Oh, yeah, you're doing... Oh, look at this. You're gonna play soccer again real soon. Oh, yeah. All right. All right. You got it. Right behind you, buddy, if you need me. Just stay in your breath. You doin' all right? Yeah, I'm just worried for you. Why? Hey, let's stop, okay? - No, I'm not... - Come on, you did great. - Take the chair the rest of the way. Luke! - Hey, Luke! Get him. Hey, hey, buddy, you okay? - Here, help me. - Let's get him up. Come on, come on, come on. Get him, I'll get the chair. Look, there's no... shame in finishing in the chair, son, come on. I can't do anything. I can't even run. You will run. You will play soccer. You really think that? We're Bernards. Bernards never quit. We can get through this. - Come on, let's go. - Yeah. - All right. - Lift your feet up, buddy. - Let's go. You got it? - There we go. All right. No shame in doing it this way. You did great. Before the accident I could run laps around you. Yeah. Now we're about neck and neck. Oh! Looks like you still got your sense of humor. Humor, you either have it or you don't. I'm sorry you don't, Ben. Oh, my God. Here we go, look, everyone's cheering you on, man. Finish right there. You did good, Luke. You did great. - Stop. - What? - What? - Stop. - The finish line is right there, son. - Yeah. I don't want to finish in this. You need the chair to finish, Luke. You can't finish without the chair. No, you don't. You don't need it. - Benjamin. - You can do this. Come on, let me get you up. All right, all right, all right. All right, take your time, take your time. Finish line is right over here, all right? It's right over here. - All right. - You got this, come on. Come on. You can do it, Luke. Come on! Come on, man! You got this, Luke. You got it! Keep on coming. Don't get in that wheelchair! Come on, it's right there! We believe in you! Come on! Come on! - Come on! Come on! - You got this, Luke! Come on! Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, look who finally shows up! - Hurry up! - All right, all right. You take longer than Ashley to get ready. What? Look who's talking, slow motion. - I'm faster than you! - Oh, you're faster than me, huh? - Yeah, they call me Flash. - Oh, okay. What do they call you again? - We're about to see what they call me. - Turtle. Turtle power. Very soon. - Still with me on what we talked about? - Yeah, I got it. I just see you training with him a lot. Just makin' sure. Don't worry about it. Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer. - Don't pinch him. - I'm not, I'm not. - I've got it. - All right. - It's not too tight, is it? - No. Oh, good. - Hon? - Yeah? Do you think now's a good time? Yeah, yes, I do. Do you remember Rebecca? Yeah, she's my wife. Well, she's... she was your fiancée. She didn't make it. She died, Luke, in the car accident. No, no. - No! No! - They said it was quick. - No, no, no! - They said she... - No, no, no! - Luke, it's okay. - No! No! - Luke, it's okay. God, no! Ah! There goes the miracle. Why are they calling me that? Because you are a miracle, Luke. You are a miracle. They didn't expect you to live, and in less than two months, you're going home. Thank you. Dad! This is what I'm gonna do to help you guys. - What? - I'll win this to help with Luke's bills. Oh, that's great, son, but it's really not up to you. No, I wanna help you, Dad. I'm gonna help you. - Okay. - Ben, wait. - Can I ride with Ben? - I don't think that's a good idea. No, it's okay. Come on. Come on. - Get your brother. - Oh, okay. - All right. - All right, let's go. Can you take me to Rebecca's? - Luke... She's... not... - I know. You all right? What'd you say? That I'm sorry. Sorry for what I've done. How much do you remember about the accident? Just... nothing. Nothing. Luke, I gotta tell you something. There's things that you don't know. Just... you don't remember. What? Oh, God, this is hard. What, Ben? It was... it was my fault. Hey, I'm legit, man. You always have to be the star. Nah, some things come naturally. Yeah, I get it. You being a jerk is natural. Okay, boys, this is not double-date talk. Please don't ruin the night. Stop. You just wait. In my pro fights, I'm gonna be making more jack than you. You're gonna make more jack than me? You're just a wannabe, though. I couldn't handle it anymore. And I punched you with everything I got. Luke... Luke, I am so sorry. Luke, I am so sorry. Can you... Look at what you've done to me. I have half a head! You killed Rebecca! I didn't mean to kill her! I didn't mean to hurt anyone! You destroyed my life! Take me home! I can't handle it! Luke? Luke! He killed her! - Daniel! What are you talking about? - He killed her! What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Nothing happened to him. He should have died! - Daniel! - He should have died. Luke? - Luke? - Benjamin! He hit me and he caused this accident. I didn't mean to hurt anyone. I tried to explain that to him, and he was so angry. He just wanted to leave. I knew you were mad at him. But I did not know you punched him. I was so angry at him. I couldn't handle it anymore! Oh, you couldn't handle it? Huh? Look what you've put us all through! Look what you did to Luke! Rebecca's dead! She's dead. I may never dance again because of you. Leave. I can't even look at you. Go! You are such a screw-up! You hurt everyone! You hurt everyone! Luke doesn't have a head! Rebecca's dead! Ashley can't even freakin' dance! She can't dance! You screwed up everything! You screwed up! There we go, bring it up. Cross. It's your time, man. It's your time. - You have no idea. - Look straight. - One, two, one now. - I gotta have this. Oh, yeah!

I could not believe that last round. Yeah, I... There's something I'm gonna have to leave and go do. I just... - Leave? - Yeah. What's wrong? You gotta leave? I'll know once I make this phone call. Ben, look at me, son. I ain't never left a soldier behind. But if you leave, I'm not gonna be in that corner with you. You think about that. - Honey, have you seen Ben? - Hi. Yes, he just stormed through here. - What? - Don't worry. I got all my stuff now. No! Mom asked you to come to my fights this month and... it was fine you didn't show. But my tournament pro fight? The biggest fight of my life! - And you still don't show. - Ben! Benjamin! - No, no, no! - Hey, listen to me. Let me finish. You've always put him first. - What? - I get it. The favorite Lukitus always gets the very best. While the rest of us... nothing. Nothing! You, society, God! You leave the rest of us to figure out everything in this world alone! What are you talking about? Your mother and I have always been there for you, for both of you. When will you ever stop? You took Rebecca from me. You took everything from me! Yeah, I screwed up. But... no matter what I do... or how good a son I am... none of it matters. Nothing I do will ever be good enough for you! And when I need you the most... you weren't there for me. Ben! Benjamin!

I'm a little dizzy. - Daniel! - Hi. - Hon, are you all right? - I'm... Ow, ow! - Oh, I'm sorry. What happened? - Yes, yes. Well, there was a... there was a disagreement after the fight. Oh, my gosh. Luke, do you have those? Let me see those. Here, help me hold that up. Here. Let's go, guys, let's go! Come on, Lukitus! Yeah! Who's behind you, buddy? Yeah! Look who got his white belt first day of karate! Ben, look here, give us a little punch. Just a punch. Perfect! All right. I'll go get my keys. I'm gonna take him, okay? Beat ya. I'm gonna take him. I want to. See you in the car, buddy. - Hiya! - That's perfect. Luke, come on, you know you didn't have to get me anything. - I signed it. - You did! Whatever could it be? - Well, you think it's a ball. - I think maybe it's a ball, okay. All right, I'm gonna open it up. Let me see here. Wow! It is... absolutely perfect. Everything I want. Thank you very much, buddy. - That's... - Dad, do you like it? I made it myself so you can play too! - You did? - Yes. Well, what did you make yourself? Let's see. Whoa! It looks like you made them yourself. Doesn't it, Mom? Doesn't it, huh? "Ben fights for Dad." Absolutely perfect. Can we go kick it around now? Sure, sure, go, go, go! Go, go! What are you doing that for? Oh, I'm gonna hang it up on the wall out here so I can see it every day. Wait. Ta-da! - Nice. - That's... I can't believe it. I can't believe this. Dad. It's crazy. God. God. God. I was wrong. Wrong about my dad. Wrong about you. I saw what you did for Luke and Ashley... I want that relationship they got with you. I'm... fighting everyone. And you... Why do you love me? Why? I'm such a screw-up. I'm sorry, God. I'm sorry for everything. Forgive me, Jesus. I'm truly sorry. You healed Luke. Heal me. Heal me. My dad... Dad. Yeah, I'm fine. - Dad... - No, no, no. Hang on a second, okay? I think... I think it's my turn to talk. I earned that. - Right? - Yeah. I mean, look at me. Yeah. Yeah. Son, I can't be everywhere all the time. I'm not God. Okay? Now... now, your brother was easy to relate to, but you, not so much. Hey, hey. You... somehow think that I favor your brother. Son, it's not favoritism, it's a relationship. It's the same kind of relationship that I've always wanted to have with you, but for some reason... I realized that when you took those hits for me. - It's just... - Yes! It's what fathers do, Benjamin. No, it's what fathers do who love their kids. Oh. I don't care if you're an MMA fighter. I don't care if you're a soccer player. I don't care if you're a clown in the circus. I don't care if you're any good at any of that stuff. I love you. Okay? I love... this. I love you. And I have loved you from the moment you were born. Because you are mine. You're my son. Benjamin, you are my son, and I love you. I love you too, Dad. Don't you dare make me cry. It hurts. Don't you dare. Oh, don't make me laugh. It hurts more. - Oh, no. - No, no, no, no, no. Okay, would you, on the back? - All right? - Okay. Oh. - Is that... all right? - Yeah. All right, let's take a look here. Hold that for me, please. Looking good. Any headaches? No. None. So are you ready to get rid of that helmet for good? Absolutely. You said that he might have to wear it for a year. It's only been a few months. I checked. He's ready for a cranioplasty. That is, unless you want to wait. Let's do it. Okay, let me check my schedule. We have an opening the 18th, next week. Yeah. Yes. - You available? - Yes! - What's wrong? - It's a miracle. - Thank you. Thank you. - Sounds good. Impressive! I used to box when I was a kid, you know that, right? Yeah. We'll call you Neo, I didn't even see those. What does that mean? Come on, Dad. The Matrix? Neo? - I got nothin'. - Ah! Tell you what, call me S.A. Uh, no hablo español. No, no, not Spanish, silly. S.A., Superior Athlete. G.S., Genetic Superior. And Mom thinks I'm cocky? - Your mom isn't here right now, is she? - No, she isn't. - Ben? - Yeah? Some good news came in. Okay, what's up? They're overturning the judge's decision 'cause Michael cheated. They found out that somebody rubbed some Vaseline on him. - What does that mean for me? - A rematch. What do you guys think? You in? - Schedule it. - All right, I'm gonna call it in. - All right! - Let's do it! Oh! There he is, our soccer champ. Luke, Luke, say hi to the camera. - Hey, buddy. - That's good. - How's the game going? - That's good. - This is so cool. - Yeah. I think we have a couple more of those. More to play. - Hey, Ben. - Hey. - Benjamin! - Mom, Dad. Luke. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm good, I'm good. I know you're doing videos, but can I talk to Luke for a second? - Yeah, absolutely. You two need to talk. - Of course, baby, yeah. All right? We'll get back to this later, okay? Luke, hey, man. So... how much longer until you're fully recovered? - You're at what, 80%? - I feel like I'm 100. Yeah, right, 100. Hey... will you come with me? I want you to meet someone at Tapp'd Out. Is Ashley gonna be there? She isn't talking to me. All right. Just give me a sec. I'll meet you at the truck. Okay. Great. - Hey, you guys. - Hey. Hey, I wanted to show you the miracle. Oh, well, it's nice to meet you, Miracle. Please, please, call me by my nickname, which is Luke. - Hmm. Okay. - Oh, gosh. So it's been under six months. - Well... - Actually... Give it, yeah. - Rare chip. - Yeah. - I think this belongs to you. - It does. Thank you. So this is why Luke wanted me to come in. Ashley. Ash, wait! I've changed! I want... - I want... - What do you want, Ben? - I want... - What do you want? I want you, okay? I want you! None of it matters if I don't have you. Ashley... I love you. Ben... I never knew that I could love somebody so much and hate them just the same. Luke, no! Come here. Come here. - You okay? - Yes, of course. I need some help with something. - That's your mom. - She's a smart lady. Yeah, that's why I married her. Well, good thing opposites attract. Yeah, that's funny. It kinda is. A little bit. There we go. - Yeah. - Whoa, whoa. - That a spot? - No, no, no. Got a spot. Hey! - Yep. - Come on. Let's get it. - All right. - Okay. Good job. - You too. - Thank you. Did come through as a pretty nice diamond. - Not in the rough anymore. - Not in the rough. No, no, no. Here. Give me five. - I didn't even try. - Give me five. - I didn't even try. - Wha-pow! - Give me five. - Hands like feet. So I thought maybe now would be a good time to start working on that project car of yours. - Really? You're gonna help me now? - Yeah, finally. All right, let's do it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! It's done. Yeah, man, all for you. Everything works? Of course! Let's take it for a ride. Let's go down to the coast. How did you do this? When did you do this? Well, I had a little help. This is amazing. Uh... - Let's hope it runs, right? - Shut up! Here, get in the car. Have fun, guys. Whoo! There it is. Yeah. - Oh, man. - Oh, wow. - Look at this. - I missed this spot. Whoo. Wow. Beautiful. Since you guys had so much fun with that car, what do you want to build next? I wanna build... a family. Whoa. All right, all right. Let's back the love train up a little bit. - Yeah? - Ben, this is huge, man. I know. All right, so, how are you gonna ask her? Not sure. I haven't even got a ring, but... now might be a bad time. So... hopelessly unromantic. Gettin' married. Oh, man. I'm sorry, Luke. You... you should be marrying Rebecca. Well. I've come to peace with the whole accident, and... - I'm sorry. - For what? I wasn't a good big brother, man. I was a jerk. I love you, man. I love you too. Whoa! - What? - Calm that grip down. - I'm in your corner, big guy. - It's go time! I'm ready. I know you are. Come here, son. Let me get you a little help there. Right, push through, right there. Come on! There we go. - Hey, Ben. - Get you all strapped in. You came. Yeah, your dad dragged me here. He wanted me to give you this. Okay... Oh. What's the note say? My dad dragged you here? No. I wanted to see this changed man fight. - Fresh start? - Yeah. - Good luck. - Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, big fight tonight. This is the rematch you have waited for. We all know the controversy the first fight ended in. The winner here gets a shot at the title. Are we ready? Let's do this! Fighter, you ready? Fighter, you ready? Bring it! Yeah, yeah, yeah! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Listen, no eye gouging! No eye gouging! - Are you okay? - You all right? - You okay? Can you continue? - Yeah. All right, let's go, let's go! Fight! Time! Time! Time! Time!

Hey, watch that kick! Last warning. Last warning and you're out. Let's go! Let's go! Fight! Time! Time! Time! Time! Time! Back to your corners. Ben! Hey! Hey! He fights dirty, but you got this, okay? You gotta dig deep. Find it in your heart. Now let's go get it done. Fighter, you ready? Fighter, you ready? Bring it! Favorite! Favorite! Favorite! Benjamin, you are my son, and I love you. Favorite! Favorite! Favorite! - I love you too. - Favorite! Favorite! "Ben fights for Dad." Absolutely perfect. Favorite! Favorite! Favorite! All right, all right, that's it, that's it! Yeah! Whoo! Somebody like Mr. Bernard, who comes in with a Glasgow Coma Score of three, and then, a few months later, is walking into my brain injury clinic, I could count those on one hand. So very, very, very uncommon, and I hesitate to say the word, but, you know, it is almost, when you see it, the first word that comes in your mind is like miraculous. Daniel and Kathy Bernard, directors of Somebody Cares Tampa Bay, with their miracle son, would you welcome Luke tonight. I'm gonna go ahead and pray a little bit right now. Dear God, thank you for all those who prayed for me to... get better. I really appreciate it. It took me some time to get better. And I really, I'm really thankful for your constant prayers. Because it really did end up changing me. And I ended up getting healed. I know a few might be a little discouraged about certain prayers, like, jobs and whatnot, but God hears those prayers, and they make a difference. And I know God's a healer. I really know. And he healed me, so I realize that. Yeah. And I just hope that, God, someday, I'll make a difference in this world and maybe in somebody as well. And I really hope for that, and I'll hope to see that real soon.
