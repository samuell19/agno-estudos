Dad. Hang On, Min-jun. We're almost there. Why is it raining so hard? Dad, I see something. Min-jun. Dad. There's nothing there. It's just the fog. Look. A scary man's following us. Min-jun, stay with me! Wake up. Open your eyes! A scary man. Over there. Cute little boy, come with me. Come and play with me. No. Min-jun, Min-jun! What's that... What's that... Ireesha, the Daughter of Elf King Around 4 a.m. this morning, a truck slid in the heavy rain and crashed into a Sedanin the opposite lane. A giant fog-like man took my son. His boy's death must've driven him insane. There's been so many accidents lately. I know. That poor man. According to police, while driving his sick son to the hospital, - Mr. Kim drove over the speed limit in heavy rain - That's... - and caused the crash - Miss. More water please? - from hallucination. Coming right up. But water's self-service. Seori Arts High School Ireesha, wait for me. You startled me. Ireesha, did you hear? About what? Jin-suk told everyone that he has a crush on you. Everyone in Class 3 knows. - He must be nuts. - Soon-mi. You think Jin-suk's weird, too? Hey, look. There's Hyun-woo! Huh? Where? - Over there. - Oh, seriously. Over there. Hyun-woo. - You're hopeless. - Oh my! Hi. - Hello. - Hello. Remember tomorrow's practice? Yes! See you in the club room tomorrow. See you. - Being handsome is a gift. - And he sure is gifted. Reesha, you have to ask him out. No way, you... you like Jin-Suk? Really? No way. Don't even. Reesha! And hi, Soon-mi. Ew. - Uh, hi. - Um, hey. We... we just should go now Sunmi. Eh, Ireesha... well, we gotta go Jin-suk. Wait for me Ireesha! Jin-suk and I have been friends since 10th grade. But one day, I thought he might have a crush on me, and it made me feel uncomfortable. Every morning I open the window And enjoy the bright sunshine Still in my dream, I smile softly This happiness, this warmth I want you to feel... Mom Hi. Yes, I remember Mrs. Glara. Mom, not again! Why would you lend her our security deposit? Whatever. It's your problem! Who cares if we become homeless! My life sucks. What does she want from me? This isn't enough. What should I do? Hey, Soon-mi. Well... Do you know where I could borrow $2,000? Two grand? Who would lend that much money to kids like us? Right? What's wrong? Why do you need so much money? I just do. I couldn't get a loan, can I? It's my mom again. Reesha, wait a minute. - I sold my guitar, - Reesha, let's talk outside. but it wasn't much. You know how hard I worked for that guitar. Reesha. Reesha, what's wrong? Reesha. Reesha! Hey, where are you going? What's the matter? Reesha. Reesha. Reesha, can I lend you the money? What? You... Let me go! Reesha! Pork Belly What does he want now? What are you doing here? I want to tell you something. I have to get back to work, so what is it? Here. Take it. What's that? What's that... It's money. I've saved some little by little. I know you need it. So... Why do you want to lend me money? Why do you want to help me? You pity me? It's not that thing. We're good friends. I don't know what happened to us though... I hope we get along well together just like before. Forget it. Jin-suk. Jin-suk. Oh, no. Oh, no. Jin-suk. We're almost there so relax. If you have the contact for his family, please let me know Oh, Jin-suk. Hey. - Jin-suk? - Sit back down. It's not safe so sit back down. But don't you see that? Let me off. Let me off. Please! Ambulance Don't go. Stop! Where did he go? What's that? It's closed. It won't budge. Princess Ireesha. Who was that? Your Highness, down here. A frog? You want to save your friend? Then give me something of yours. What? A talking frog? Calling me a princess? Was that you talking to me? Yup! Who else is here? I said give me your belonging to save your friend. It's a talking frog! Your friend was hit by a car? How did you know that? Elf King took your friend. Elf King? Who's that? No time to explain. And I can't help until you give me something of yours. It touched my face. Stay away! Go away! You scared me. Is it dead? It's huge. The hat is smaller than I thought. What's this? Your Highness. Stay still. I'm almost done. Why are you tying me up? Where are you taking me Help! I taste bad. Please put me down. It should be around here. -Put me down! - Found it. What did you just do What now? Your Highness, hold on tight - What for? - Ready. Here we go! Yay! What's wrong? I'm kidnapped by a frog! Mom, I'm sorry! I haven't dated a boy yet! Your Highness, please hold still. We're almost there. Where are we going? - It's beautiful. - Out of my way! Ouch How will you pay for flower cart? Your Highness, are you okay? Go away Where are we? Shoo! Go away. Never seen a frog before? Where are we? The people here are... Are we in Europe? Wow, how pretty. Animals are walking upright. Oh, how cute. Don't you touch me! - At least you have good taste. - Sorry. It's my first time here. You broke my flower cart. How will you pay for it? I'm sorry. I don't have any money. I'll get it fixed later. Elf King is back. - Hide! - It's too bad. Elf King? What's going on? Where did everyone go? They went to hide from Elf King. We should, too. There's no time. This way. Slow down. Lip Balm Would you look at him... Dad, what are you doing? I need more souls. I can't breathe Jin-suk's soul is inside that castle. In there? Taking his soul back to your world will bring him back to life. I got it. You can let go of my hand. Sorry. Princess. That darn frog. Hey! I'm not a princess. You lost your memory. You're the daughter of the real Elf King who was murdered. Your Majesty! I found this outside the castle. What's this? It must be from the human world. It's Ireesha. Huh? Ireesha? She came here voluntarily? That was ballsy Your Majesty, I did good, so can you switch me back... Maria, Sasha. Take care of Ireesha. No worries. Your Majesty, what about me? I'm tired. Originally this fairy world used to be the shelter for dead human souls. The present Elf King killed the genuine Elf King and has dominated this fairy world. I heard that one of the fairies evacuated you to the world of mortals at the time. Okay, let's go inside. We go through that gate? That gate won't open. What are you doing? We have to climb the wall. Climb that wall on your back? No way! You never mentioned this! I'm sorry I didn't tell you. But you have to trust me. But I don't even know you. And how can I trust a frog? Fine. Go home, then. Just go back the way you came in. But you'll never stop feeling guilty about letting Jin-suk die. This is your last chance. You're right We need to sneak inside first. We'll figure out what to do after. Hold on tight. You're not going to call me Your Highness anymore? Did I? How did I end up here? This doesn't feel real Ouch. Ireesha, get up. Oh, I feel dizzy. Where are we? I think this is someone's room. I wonder who lives here. I think it's a girl's room. It's so much better than mine. Is anyone out there? No, nobody's here. Pick an outfit and put it on. An outfit? This is huge. What do I do? What? How did that happen? Hurry up and come out. Coming. - This way. Let's go. - Okay. Ireesha, this way! Okay. That was close. Ireesha. How do I find her? Huh? Something's off. My dress is missing. Ireesha? This must be it. This door will lead us to Elf King's room. Ireesha, hold on. Why? The design of the doors changed. You're right. Ireesha! What happened? What is this place? What's all this? This is weird. - Ireesha, wait. - How pretty. Don't touch anything, Ireesha! What do we do? What's this? Ireesha! This is so pretty. Ireesha, don't fall for that! Don't... What? I'd love to wear this every day. - It's great. - That looks very good on you. As if it was made for you. Who are you? Ireesha! Poor Ireesha. It's been very hard, hasn't it? You can put everything behind you now. Wear beautiful and expensive clothes and just be happy. That's... That's... If you choose this, you can't have anything else. That hurts! Ireesha. Grab that guitar! The guitar. Look at yourself. Don't you look beautiful? Frog. Frog! How dare you ruin my plans! I'm going to kill you! Die! Die! Frog! Ireesha. - Get the guitar. - The guitar? Hurry What do I do? Play the guitar. Hurry. Stop it! It worked. Frog, are you okay? You're bleeding. I'm okay. You did well. What's that? It's the guitar. What's going on? - Limbs... - Limbs... - Who are you ? - What? My name's Robby, Robby Krieger. Heard of the Legendary Guitar? That's me! Was it you who woke me up? Ireesha! You finally came to see me! You know me? Long ago, when we sang together, though you weren't very good, you were very convincing. you were very convincing. you were very convincing. Of course it was all possible because I helped you. So, who's that ugly frog? No idea what you're talking about, but I'm here for my friend's soul. Your friend's soul? Yeah. I heard there's a room with trapped souls here? Oh, that room! I might know and could help you find it, but sorry, I have a meeting. - Is he going to help or not? - He talks too much. I'm meeting the Cello and Harp Fairy, better known as the String Fairies. As you know, I can't miss it. See you around. I've been asleep for decades, and this is how they treat me. Why did you stop? What is it? - What? Why? - Where are you going? Those over there are the scariest things in this castle. What are they? The guards of the spirit room. They're asleep. Now's my chance. Where are you going? Where do you think you're going? - I need to use the bathroom. - Ireesha! Oh, no. They woke up. - Do something. - They're creepier than I thought. Here goes nothing. Hello, you frigid four, heard any songs lately? heard any songs lately? You must be bored to death, standing here for eternity. Want to hear her song? You won't regret it. No, no! - Show them what you got. - I can't sing. What am I supposed to sing? The one Elf King's daughters sing. I don't know that one What should I sing? Oh, there's no time. Robby! Ireesha, hurry up! - Oh dear god! - What shoud I sing? They'll kill me. - Sing something! - Concentrate! Was it a hard day for you today? Sadness fills up making you feel small Can you tell me? Can you let me know? It's okay, I'm here for you Sweet dreams, my love, good night Count the stars with me It worked. You did it! Good job, Ireesha. Did I really do this? All thanks to me. What would you do without me? You need me to... What's that sound? I've never been inside. They are the souls taken from the human world. They keep Elf King rejuvenated. I'm scared. Let's get out of here. Jin-suk might be in there. I have to do something. -Ireesha! - No! Jin-suk! Jin-suk... She's so reckless. - Ireesha! - Wait for me, Ireesha! Jin-suk! Jin-suk! Elf King is here! How dare you come in here? Elf King, give me back my friend's soul! How scary you are! I'll kill you, like your father. Now that you're in here, I can't let you leave. What? I'll feed you to the guard dogs. I'll feed you to the guard dogs. I'll take your soul. No! How come she's so powerful? Ireesha, let's go! What about Jin-suk? You want to die here? Run. Get them! Let's go! Let's go, Ireesha! This way! Hurry! - What? Who led us here? - It's a dead end. It's a dead end! This way, hurry! Ireesha! Your Highness. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. Your Highness. I've admired you for a long time. Our world is under a curse. And only you can break it. You must break the curse in order to defeat Elf King. They're coming! Go west to the Black Forest and find the tree of memory Titania. Titania? Titania knows everything. You must find out about the curse. You must find out about the curse. But what about you? That's... Don't worry about me. And don't trust anyone here. There might be a spy among your company. We need to run! Can I have your name? Please be careful. Ireesha, come! Who was that man? I wonder if he's okay. He was weird. And who knows why he helped us? But he helped us. Still, you can't just trust anyone. A slick man like him might have an ulterior motive. You're too quick to trust people. What about you? Can I trust you? How did you find me? What? I mean, why did you offer to help? We'll talk about that later. Why did Frog take me to the Elf King's castle? Was Jin-suk really there? What if Frog lied to me? He still has the scars he got from helping me. I can trust Frog. We have to hurry up. Why are you in such a hurry? Are you really trying to help me? Are you sure there's no other reason? I know. Something is fishy. I've lived here for a hundred years, and I've never seen him before. Aren't you gonna talk? It's that way. Let's go. No, I won't move until you tell me who you are Me neither. Did that man tell you not to trust me? What? No! Why would you say that? Why? You trust him because he's handsome? Hey! Don't jump to conclusions. I understand. I saw how much you loved the expensive stuff. You'd trust a handsome man, but not a frog like me. Even his clothes looked expensive. You're wrong. You don't know anything about me! Just forget it. You're so unreasonable. That frog's acting really suspicious. Is it because she lived in the human world for so long? She has no dignity of a princess left in her. Dignity? How dare you say that? What's this? You think you exude dignity? - Shush! - What is it? Don't you shush me! Quiet. Don't order me around! No, I can't be captured like this. Help! Let me go! Restaurant Miso Is she going to eat us? Oh, no. - We are not tasty. - Please let me go. Let you go? I can't do that. Customers will arrive soon, and I'm out of bugs Oh? You're... You are... Ireesha? Ireesha. It's you. Ireesha, you know her? What's wrong? It's me, Mi-so! Choi Mi-so. Don't you remember me? We sat next to each other in grade school. Oh, right, the girl with eight legs. Yes! Ireesha. It's been so long. We even took a friendship oath. By the way, can I eat that plump frog? No. He's my friend. How about just one leg? How interesting. Hey, stop. I see dust falling off. So what do they serve here? What's taking so long? I'm starving. The menu's written in Korean. She must've gone to a culinary school. Food! - Thanks. - Looks yummy. Enjoy. I don't mean to brag, but my restaurant is pretty famous. I made sure it's extra delicious. A bug. - Looks yummy, huh? - Thanks. Everyone seems to love it. Huh? It's good. Remember how we went to the human world to get boy band posters? This is so good. I think I still have them in the storage. Well, Mi-so, to be honest, I don't remember any of that. And I'm not even sure if I am that Ireesha. Don't say that. I remember you. You're my friend. Really? I must find a friend's soul. He might die, and it's all my fault. You are such a softie. Poor Ireesha, can I help? I'm your BFF after all. We must go to the Black Forest and see Titania. It's that forest on the hill. But be careful. It's guarded by a giant hedgehog. Thanks, Mi-so. It's too far. Goodbye, Ireesha. - Bye. See you again! - Goodbye! Be careful! - Bye! - Bye! Let's hurry. That was scary. By the way, am I really plump? It's a little spooky here. I know. What's that? What's that sound? What is that? What is that sound? Over there! A hedgehog! - It's headed for us! - Ireesha. What do we do? I'll distract him. Ireesha, head for the trees. Okay. Come here. Ireesha, that way! Okay. Wait for me. Help! We're here. There's a forest inside a forest. How strange. Is that tree Titania? Let's go. What do I do? Well, this is... You're supposed to pull something. I am... Oh dear. - The tree of memory, Titania. - She's talking. What do you want to know? What's the curse on Ireesha? Right! - You only get one chance - Memory. to look into your memory. Robby, look at them. What is this? A fairy? Catch them, Ireesha. And you can see! Huh? Okay! It's not easy. Oh, I can't catch any. Frog! I'm sorry. - Stop! Stop! - Don't hurt me! Ireesha. Ireesha. Watch out. I don't think he's a mean hedgehog. What a relief. Ireesha, did you find out anything? Just a few things. Princess's love will save the world. What do you think that means? Princess's love? Robby, what did you hear? I heard, princess, love, can't. Princess, love, can't? What is that? You didn't get the whole curse. Isn't it obvious? Princess can't fall in love. That's bad. What do we do now? Oh, boy! We need to get someone to fall in love with Ireesha. Who could fall for Ireesha? Ireesha, can you think of anyone? Well, it can't be Hyun-woo, can it? What if there's someone near? Near? Like who? - Frog, you're... - What is it? What about me? A genius. - That man. - What man? When we escaped from the castle. But we don't even know where to find him. Is there a place with a lot of men? A Ball? Well, that would be... There's a ball every night at Andrew's mansion. Yes, a ball! There's a ball somewhere? Yes, he moved here recently, so not much is known about him. But he's supposedly really rich. But he's supposedly really rich. I see. Great. We're going to a ball! Your dress looks fantastic. Mi-so did a great job. I've never been to a ball. Look at all these people. This is awkward. I don't know what to do. Why won't anyone ask Ireesha to dance? My poor Princess Ireesha! May I have this dance? - It's okay. - May I? - Go on, Ireesha. - Sure. He's so enthusiastic. Excuse me. How humiliating. Ireesha! He is Andrew. So sweet. You are... Are you okay? You're Andrew? Thank you for the other day. I found out about the curse thanks to you. That's great, Princess Ireesha. Shall we celebrate with a dance? Yes I'm sorry. Oops, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I guess you don't like my place. Or did I make you feel uncomfortable? I'm sorry, but I've never danced to music like this. Then shall we change the music? What's going on? The day greets me with a smile Cars drive by leisurely Every step I took forms a melody Making a song of our own Our story flows clearly And journeys toward the vast sea Every day, every night I'll be there for you You are a good singer Surprise! What's with him? What's wrong? Everything's going well, isn't it? It is going well. Wait! Do you have a crush on Ireesha? Me? No. How could I love a princess? Even if I did, that couldn't break the curse. A frog and a princess don't go together. Sure they do. In fairy tales, they make a great pair, didn't you know? Really? Really, baloney. I was kidding. Let me tell you. I'm really good at sensing romantic chemistry. You are? I think Andrew is falling for Ireesha. Where have you been? How's it going? I'm not sure. You think Andrew could love someone like me? I'd say he has a much better chance than some froggy. What? Robby, you little! - Enough is enough. - Princess Ireesha. You should go. Okay. See you later. I think we can break the curse. I didn't get a chance to ask before, but what was the curse? Oh, that. Nobody can love the princess. Only her love will save the world. I have a feeling the curse will be broken soon. Pardon? Oh my... Ouch. What's wrong? Well, I just remembered I have to do something. My goodness, I don't believe this. There's something wrong with Andrew. He turned into an owl. - An owl? - But what about the curse? Ireesha. Will you marry me? If you do, you can break the curse, and I can be the next Elf King. Then I'll be the most beautiful Elf King. I hate how I look now! Marry me, Princess Ireesha. No! Run! Get them! Ireesha, this way! Hedgehog, go! What do we do now? Plan Andrew is a goner. Let's break the curse in the human world. Ireesha, marry me! He's going to catch us. - What was that? - What was that? He said he'll distract Andrew. Really? He said not to worry about him. Said he's stronger than Andrew. What? They're gone! Hurry! We're back. - What's wrong? - What are you doing? You're shrinking. That's strange. The magic power is growing weak. Jin-suk. What's wrong? It's nothing. The boy in room 305. They've taken him off life support. Oh no, for real? How terrible! I know right? He never has gotten back up again. I feel so sorry for him. Jin-suk. Jin-suk. Ireesha, pull yourself together. We're running out of time. If we can't break the curse, we can't stop Elf King Right. I can't let Jin-suk die. Ireesha, about how to break the curse. It's weird... Because I am in... I'm going to ask Hyun-woo out. Hyun-woo? Because you think he likes you? No, it's not that. I have a crush on Hyun-woo. Why? Because he's handsome? It's not like that. Something happened. It was a rainy day. I didn't have an umbrella, and I was really sick. This is porridge. I heard you have a cold. Where's your umbrella? Thank you. It's nice to see you smile. Get better soon. See you in school. I still have the bag. That was when it began. I see. What should we do to make Hyun-woo fall in love? How about a horror movie? It's supposed to make you believe you're in love. That's a good idea. Really? You think that'll work? There's no time. You just have to go for it. - Just go for it? - Just go for it? Hyun-woo, are you free later? I want to go somewhere with you. I was worried that you were gone for a few of days. You didn't answer your phone. Why do you ask if I'm free? Let's see a movie. A horror movie. It wasn't as scary as I thought. Right? No. By the way, Why? You have something for me? No, I don't. I like you. Here. What's this? The bag you gave me on that rainy day. Oh, that. Actually, that was from Jin-suk. What? Jin-suk told me you were sick and bought the porridge for you. and bought the porridge for you. But he's just so shy. It was Jin-suk? Reesha. I'm fine. Ireesha! Robby. Run. Hurry! Why? Andrew is coming! What? Get on my back. Hurry! Okay. No! Robby. Robby, are you okay? I'm okay. I guess I've stayed in the human world for too long. Robby, No! Robby's not moving! - Stay with me! Listen carefully. - Robby. There's only one gate. When Andrew and others follow me in, smash the lock with a rock. And no one could open it again from the inside. What about you? What about Jin-suk, Mi-so, Hedgehog and all the others? Just think about yourself. You're not responsible for us. Forget friends. Take good care of Robby. Hide here. Frog. I wanted to ask you something. What do you think about me? What? Do you hate me? What are you talking about? Find them! Over there! I liked you from the moment I saw you. Ever since you appeared from behind the blue door until now. Frog! Robby. Ireesha This is... Ireesha. Tada! You wrote my name. Now it'll always come back to you even if you lose it. You must be new. Come in. Hello. Ever since you appeared from behind the blue door until now. Frog was Jin-suk. Jin-suk. Jin-suk. Jin-suk. I'm sorry... Your shoelaces got untied again. Now they won't get untied again. Do I have to do this every day? I had no idea they came untied. Oh, I'm late for Hyun-woo's concert! See you later. Watch where you're going, or you'll get hurt. I'm really light, aren't I? Can't you see my arm shaking? Get up. Hyun-woo's looking for you. Really? Mister, I have to get off. Please stop! I'm sorry, Jin-suk. I always thought of myself as the victim I was angry at the people who didn't love me. The curse I bear wasn't that nobody ever loved me. The princess will never know who loves her. That was the curse I bear. Why haven't I ever looked back? It's over. The gate is completely shut. It's too late. No, it's not too late. If I am the Elf King's daughter, I wouldn't need a key. I have to make it work. Liar! I considered your opinions, I considered your opinions, but there's no other way. I'm doing this for you. We know you're trying to make us your slaves! If you keep complaining, you'll end up like this. Knock it off, now! It's Princess Ireesha. Princess Ireesha. It's great, Princess Ireesha. Princess Ireesha is here. It's Princess. Do you want to marry me now? Why would I marry you? I wasn't going to hurt you if you married me. You're a fool. - How dare you. - Ireesha. Jin-Suk. Go and get the princess. - Damn - Take him. Stop. Hurry. Get them! Stop them! Jin-suk. Jin-suk! I can't find him. Jin-suk. Jin-suk! Andrew? What? Elf King. What a fool. You betrayed me and tried to take over my kingdom? You should've obeyed me. How ridiculous. You wanted to be beautiful? We need to put an end to this. Princess! What's this? What's going on? Oh, no. When Sasha brings more souls, nobody will be able to stop me. No! I can't move. Jin-suk! Jin-suk, where are you? What do I do? No. No! Get away from me. Get away from me! No! You want to find your friend? Go ahead. See if you can. But you'll run out of time! No, I won't lose any more people I love! Ireesha, open your eyes. I'm always there you can see me. Jin-suk? Jin-suk. Jin-suk. Jin-suk, I'm sorry. I took so long. I finally found you. Thank you. Ireesha. Robby? I'm awake. Are you alright? What happened? Froggy, it's nice to see you again. Well done Ireesha. Hospital Here. His soul. Jin-suk! Ireesha. You're really... back. Are you okay? Are you in pain? Do you recognize me? Are you dizzy? Slow down, Ireesha. Breathe Thank you for coming back to me. I send all the innocent souls back to the human world. Ireesha, you broke the curse and saved the world! We'll live happily ever after here. We'll be so rich! Robby, the Guitar Fairy. I'm used to the human world, and I want to go back to my mom What about us? Can't you see everyone's happy to have you back? Robby, you take charge. I know you can do it. Me? How could I? Actually, my looks and my voice are cut out for politics. Right. I'm sure you'll be great. There are so many things I want to do. If that's what you want, so be it. Did you all hear that? I will rule this world in her place. But you have to visit often. Okay. Ireesha! Hi. Mi-so. Ireesha. Congratulations, Ireesha. So, the friend you were saving, was your boyfriend? It's not like that, Mi-so. My restaurant's bigger now. - You have to come. - Really? Congratulations, Mi-so. I promise I'll visit. And I'll bring everyone here to your restaurant to celebrate. You mean it? Then I'll need more bugs. The moment you've been waiting for. Let's give it up for a young singer-songwriter, Ireesha. Welcome. Hello. Was it a hard day for you today?
