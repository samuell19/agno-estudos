I'm late enough as it is. Did you say "McClintock"? Yes. [ Sighs ] Put him through. [ Phone Beeps ] Mr. McClintock. Renny Jacobson. Yes, sir, it has been a long time. What can I do for you? Okay. Yes, sir. I understand. Yes, sir. Right. I appreciate you calling. Thank you. Sir. Tell Mr. Barnette... Tell Mr. Barnette there's nothing I can do about the signatures... on the South End merger documents. Seems I gotta go to Charleston to bury my father. Oh, I'm sorry. I have high hopes for Mr. Jacobson. Very high hopes. [ Man ] ♪ Amazing ♪ Grace ♪ How sweet ♪ The sound ♪ That saved ♪ A wretch [ Sniffling ] ♪ Like me ♪ I once ♪ Was lost ♪ But now ♪ I am found ♪ So blind ♪♪ I wanna miss him, Mama A. I know, son. He was just so different after your mama died... harder. All I ever knew was hard. Well, you know, he told me, right before he died, that he knew he might have been too hard on you. I guess he never told you. Come on, honey. Oh. [ Exhales ] [ Man ] There we are in the quad at The Citadel. Can you find your father? Yup. Shall we? Uh, have a seat. I brought my copy. Even with the size of the estate, it shouldn't be too complicated. He left everything to me. Renny, uh, what do you remember about holographic wills? They're handwritten, without the legal boilerplate. Uh, usually no witnesses. Why? Well, your, uh, father added this to his file. It's dated one month after the will you have. We just found it. How do we know this is authentic? He anticipated that. This from a local psychiatrist attesting to his mental competency. Handwriting analysis. It's a match. "All my residual estate... "in equal shares to The Citadel, Charleston Historical Society and the Episcopal Parish of St. Albans." Whoa. He left me nothin'? - Well, we can just tear it up. - Renny, you're a lawyer. You know better than that. St. Albans Parish? I mean, he wasn't even religious. - Yeah, maybe that was the guilt speaking. - Oh, please! He's paying his way into heaven! Well, he did say that you were to receive his, uh, gold coin collection and, uh... "The right, title and interest... "to any and all assets, tangible and intangible, to my share of the Covenant List of South Carolina, Limited." We went through the inventory of assets and didn't find any record of this company. You know what it is? He never told me anything, Mr. McClintock. Obviously. Well, he, uh, did leave you this key to a safe-deposit box. Number 413 at Planters and Merchants Bank. Oh, and one other thing here. Do, uh... Do you recognize any of these names? "Desmond Larochette, Bart Maxwell, Thomas Layne IV, Taylor Johnston." [ Sighs ] Families with long histories in the low country. No personal connections? No, none that I know of. Why? Well, he left instructions that his obituary was to be sent to these people. Well, any responses? No. Was there anything else, or... should I not even bother to ask? Fortunately not. I'll delay the sale of the house for a few weeks, so you can take out anything you want to. What about, uh... What about the first edition of To Kill a Mockingbird? Well, you keep it. And his boat, the Jacobson IV? Oh, sorry. That's a titled asset. Tell me. What was he worth? How much did he not leave me? Well, depending on the value of the securities at the time of probate, it was more than $22 million. ♪♪♪ [ Man Vocalizing ] ♪ Everybody everywhere ♪ Is happy ♪♪♪ [ Indistinct ] ♪ Leads them up the garden path ♪ ♪ So easily ♪ Don't close your eyes ♪ Don't look so surprised ♪ You had to swallow every lie ♪♪♪ [ Exhaling ] Also, uh, contact Mr. Thompson at New Dominion. Get a meetin' lined up sometime in the next week to discuss escrow. Remind him that Pat Jenkins promised us prime plus one. If he doesn't... [ Quiet Hissing Sound ] [ Male Voice Whispering ] [ Hinges Squeaking ] "1863." What's this? [ Man's Voice ] I expect the terms of my will may have come as a shock. My father's will contained those same provisions. Don't worry. Your true wealth lies in the Covenant List of South Carolina... or, as we call it, "The List." If anyone else is in the room with you, please ask them to leave. The gold coin has been passed down from father to son... for 140 years... as a symbol of the true source of financial stability... for our family. Toward the end of the war, most planters and landowners faced the loss... of everything their families had built. Our family, together with 10 other plantation owners, entered into an agreement, a covenant, if you will. This group smuggled gold out of the Confederacy... to safe havens throughout the world. Funds now flow through Swiss banks. For many years, I've had the honor and privilege of being the keeper of the List. On the wall next to my desk... there is a compartment. In the top left drawer rests a key. That key opens the compartment which contains the List. By now there should be a letter on my desk... notifying you of the meeting that will begin your initiation process. Do not discuss this with anyone. Most importantly, there has not always been unity among the members. Be careful. Preservation of the List is everything. Carpe diem. Rice Planter's Inn, this weekend. Listen to me. Listen to me! I am holding in my hand, as we speak, a letter from your bank giving me full ownership of this account. Now you're telling me that without this Desmond Larochette's signature, I can't get access to my money? Really? Listen here. I'm goin' out of town this weekend. Come Monday, you better have my money. No. Not again. Hi. [ Chattering ] Thanks. [ Bells Jingle ] Can I help? No. Thank you. - Haven't I seen you before? - Honestly, right now is really not the time. You were at St. Albans Cemetery, right? I was burying my father. So was I. - How did you remember me? - You were crying. I wasn't. - [ Dog Barking ] - One of y'all need a tow? Yeah. I do. Hi. Uh, shop's right around the corner, baby. You wanna ride over with me and Harold? [ Harold Barks ] I can give you a lift. Or at least allow me to wait with you, make sure everything's okay. Really, it's okay. I think I'll just chance it with Harold. How 'bout, uh, I buy you lunch? Hey, uh... Y'all can call my cell, right? Yeah. How's that barbecue over there? The best pig in the county. Tell 'em I sent you, they'll give you extra hush puppies. - Best pig in the whole county. - Sugar, you sure you don't want a ride? We'll be in plain view the whole way. Promise. Renny Jacobson. Jo Johnston. Pleased to meet you, Jo. [ Man On Radio: Country ] ♪ And you shiver when the cold... ♪ I always thank God for barbecue. At this place, you pray after you eat. [ Laughing ] - Some more tea? - Yeah. Please. [ Tea Pouring ] Mmm. Thank you. [ Chuckles ] - What was your father's name? - Taylor. Taylor Johnston. [ Cell Phone Rings ] Harold. Ooh. Thanks. Hello. [ Sighs ] Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Bye. Unbelievable. I'm not going to know anything until tomorrow. Jo, are you going to the Rice Planter's Inn? Jo Taylor Johnston? Yeah. Josiah Fletchall Jacobson. Let's make some arrangements. I can bring you back for your truck. Have you tried to get your money? Money? What money? What did your father tell you? Nothing. He left when I was a baby. I got a letter and that truck, and you can see how that turned out. Well, figure over 140 years' compound interest. Is this legitimate? [ Chuckles ] I'm a lawyer, and I'm keepin' an open mind. Hmm. I just came here to find out more about my father. [ Engine Starts ] I know too much about my father. [ Both Chuckling ] Which one doesn't belong? Wow. My mom's always been a volunteer. She used to volunteer at the library, and she also volunteered at the hospital, so that kind of got me interested in medicine, but I don't know. School's really expensive, so right now I'm just taking the semester off... from nursing school at Wake Forest. Hmm. How do you like the South as opposed to Michigan? Um, well, when it's like this, I like it a lot. You know, it's nice not having as much snow. The people are friendlier, at least when you first meet them. What about you? Me? Well, uh... For me the South is many things. It's, uh, live oaks with long memories, like the ones we passed coming in here. Azaleas in April. Novels, for sure, by Faulkner, Percy. Characters so real, they remind me of my neighbors. [ Chuckling ] The sun rising over the Ashley River... with the mist comin' off the water. - And barbecue. - [ Laughing ] Definitely the barbecue. [ Renny ] Wow. Impressive, huh? You ready for this, Jo? I guess. Good afternoon. Your father's room, Mr. Jacobson. Second floor, turn right, third door on your left. And your father's room is across the hall. The meeting is in there. 7:00. Thank you. Are you ready? [ Chattering ] A woman! [ Chattering Stops ] [ Chuckling ] Well, we can see that, Gus. You must be Josiah. You have your father's eyes. Desmond Larochette. People call me Renny. I bet they do. And you are? Jo Taylor Johnston. Jo. Ah. Without an "E," I presume. [ Kisses ] Mmm. Very nice to meet you. Uh... Well, gentlemen, please, introduce yourself to our guests. Mr. Jacobson, Miss Johnston. Bart Maxwell. Bart Maxwell. Renny Jacobson. Nice to meet you. Thomas Layne. Michael Flournoy. - Nice to meet you. - Welcome. Hey. I'm Gus Eicholtz. Hey. Renny Jacobson. Can I get y'all a drink? Rather, two drinks. Um, soda water, with lime, please. Yes, ma'am. You, sir? Chivas, rocks. Comin' up. Nervous? Not since the bar exam. You should've had Gus coach you. He seems to know the bar very well. Here you go. Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Who is that? That's John C. Calhoun, secretary of state under William Henry Harrison. Enduring symbol of the old South. Died in 1850. He looks mad. Not half as mad as he'd look if he died in 1865. In these parts, when people talk about "the war," they mean the war between the states. Or some of us down here call it "the war of Northern aggression." [ Jo Laughs ] Oh, come on now, Harry. Hurts no one to let her dine with us. What can you tell me about my father? He was a brilliant engineer. Could have designed the Golden Gate. But every time I talked to him, he was in a new town. At these things, he'd stay at the bar, kept mostly to himself... especially about his family. Why would he keep me a secret? Dear heart, do you see any other women here? [ Tone Ringing ] Lady and gentlemen. Would you please take your places for dinner? We all have assigned seats. Your family sits right over there, Miss Johnston. - This is your father's chair. - Thank you. I was, uh, sorry to hear about your father. Where'd it happen? He'd just double bogeyed number 17 on the links course at Wild Dunes. That hole almost killed me one time, remember? Yeah. [ Laughing ] Now, I'll give you the real introductions to these people here. Flournoy wishes he could put "count" in front of his name. Roget there is Desmond's shadow. Harry nurses his grudge against Desmond. Seems that Desmond's great-granddaddy shot Harry's great-granddaddy... in the kneecap with a Derringer. Do you like chateaubriand? Yes, I do. Good. Weiss... He's a bean counter from Virginia. He looks tough, but he takes a bodyguard with him everywhere he goes. And Desmond, well, he's not enjoying this evening. He does not enjoy the controversy... caused by Miss Johnston. And unless he can pull a Strom Thurmond, he'll die without an heir. Of course, Thomas here... is enjoying Miss Johnston. Absolutely. And poor Bart Maxwell. Getting married in two weeks. Gonna lose his freedom. To a Yankee, no less. Hear. Hear. [ Chuckling ] Miss Johnston, your presence here tonight... presents us with quite a dilemma. I'm sure you can appreciate that. Now, I've spoken to Harry here, and we believe the issue should be discussed by all the members... in your absence. As for Mr. Jacobson, why, I see no reason why he shouldn't be part of these discussions. Is that fair, to put him in that position? I have no problem with him staying. - Well, I do. - [ Desmond ] All right. Let's put it to the vote. I shall abstain. All those in favor of Mr. Jacobson leaving the room... while Miss Johnston's status is discussed, please raise your right hand. Harry, Robert, Michael. Anyone else... Jerrod. That's four to three. Majority rules. They seem harmless enough. I'm sure you'll get in. I'm not sure I want in. What? I don't know, Renny. Come on. It's like secret societies and blood oaths. These aren't little kids. They're grown men. It feels weird. Just play along, Jo. Think about the money. Please, rejoin us. Miss Johnston, your family... has participated in the List since the very beginning. Uh, nevertheless, there's something to be said... for tradition. Membership has passed from father to son... for nearly a century and a half. Now, it's this... this dedication to tradition... that's been our strength. The Johnston family participation in the List... has come to an end. I'll go, but first I have some questions. I want to know more about my father. Uh, we don't socialize very much, Miss Johnston. It's a business partnership. So you don't know anything. My father left me a letter blaming this group for the way his life turned out. Every old Southern family has its share of, um, lunatics... in the back parlor... and illegitimate children in the shack down the road. [ Men Chuckling ] That's not quite what I meant, and I think you know that. Well, then thank you for dinner, gentlemen. Miss Johnston. - We do hope that you will use your discretion. - Wait a minute. What about her money? Participation in the List is for members only. Even if she's out, shouldn't she be paid for the past? That's her father's responsibility. That's not ours. Miss Johnston, you wait here just a minute. Years ago, your father and I were fishing off the Florida Keys, and a storm wave washed me overboard. Your father saved my life. Now, when you think about him, try to remember, that's the kind of man he was. Thank you. Good night. [ Chattering ] Gentlemen. I'd like to call to order... the 247th meeting... of the Covenant List of South Carolina, Limited. Now, I... Renny. Will you please sit down? Thank you. Now at this time, I'd like to pause... in honor of the memory of Benjamin Hammond, an original signer of the list, who died childless in 1884. Right. Harry here... He's our historian. [ Clears Throat ] The Covenant List of South Carolina, Limited, was established during the war between the states by our ancestors... to provide for the financial security... of their families and descendants. Now, wherefore... the mutual promises recited herein... are agreed to by the undersigned... [ Clears Throat ] Uh, in... by blood covenant... and bind their descendants... to the rule of primogeniture. Signed Henri Larochette, George P. Smithfield, Alexander Weiss, Frederick Eicholtz... Harry. Are you finished? Pierre Roget... - Good job. Good job, Harry. - Marcus J. Johnston... Good. Thank you, Harry. All right, Harry. Thank you. Um, right. Good job. Uh... Renny, would you mind? - I have some questions too. - There's no need. You're already in. [ Laughing ] Would you join me? It's just a formality. [ Chuckling ] Now, just sign here in the space... underneath your father's name. Now, for millennia, blood has represented life. Now, your life, along with your forefathers, is joined to us by an irrevocable bond. Congratulations, son. [ Laughing ] [ Chuckling ] Welcome. Hear! Hear! Welcome. [ Men Chattering ] Bravo. Bravo. You're one of us now. Gentlemen. I'd like to propose a toast... to Bart. [ Chuckling ] Hear! Hear! Hear! Hear! Thank you, everyone. Uh, tomorrow we're reenacting the South's defeat at Fort Anderson. I'm sure you've seen the signs. Everyone's invited. Thanks. For the record, I will be wearing gray. [ All Laughing ] [ Chattering ] [ Squawking ] Good morning. Hey. Good morning, Renny. Uh, Renny. We need to talk. Okay. Not here. At the Jamboree later today. Good. So you're gettin' married? Yeah. Two weeks. [ Chuckling ] How'd you know she was the one? You'll know. So, you learn the secret handshake yet? Somethin' like that. [ Laughs ] Could you, uh... Could you meet me out front in a few minutes? Sure. [ Whispering ] Good morning, Renny. Good morning. You have not touched the shrimp and grits. That recipe is from 82 Queen Street. It is delicious. A woman scorned. I don't think she's the type to... Well, we don't take any chances. Why, look at how her daddy deceived us. Just make sure she's headed home... and that she intends on keeping her mouth shut. Delicious. Okay. Mr. Larochette. Where are you going in such a hurry, huh? Pursuing Miss Johnston? I'll tell you this. It's a better hobby than any of mine. [ Laughs ] Mr. Weiss sort of asked me to... Oh, that old goat. Listen, the List has survived for over 140 years. She's not a threat. You spend as much time with her as you want. Thank you, sir. I intend to. Good. Oh, listen. We'll be reconvening tonight, discussing a possible disbursement. Sounds good. Yeah. Did you see that Corvette in the lot? Beautiful, huh? Yes, sir. Well, it's yours. Welcome to the List, son. The title and a little gas money in the envelope. Thank you, Mr. Larochette. Renny. I know your relationship with your daddy wasn't the best. He kind of had his own way. Yeah, he did. I know I didn't see eye to eye with him either. I just want you to know that I am here for you... whenever you need me. Thank you, sir. I... I appreciate it. Now, you drive safely. I will. Thank you. Well, looks like you got more than a secret handshake. Just found out my transmission's totally shot. Hmm. Best I can do. Thank you. Ah, but wait. You gave me the wrong set. You wanna go for a ride? [ Safety Bell Dinging ] My grandfather owned several miles of beach just north of here. He sold it in the '20s. Dumb move, huh? How can you own the beach? Oh, wait. Then again, who needs beachfront property when you're a member of the List? Ah. Ha-ha. Ha-ha. So what are you gonna do with all your money anyway? [ Sighs ] Get free. Quit the firm. I'm tired of being lawyer number 104 out of 104... on that letterhead. Then... I don't know. I thought I might... write. Write? Hmm. Any ideas? Somethin' important like, uh, The Yankees' Guide to Southern Barbecue. [ Laughing ] I'm almost done with my research. Oh, okay. Actually, I do have an idea in mind. I've always been fascinated with the story about a group of 10,000 Southerners... who pulled up and moved to Brazil in 1867. Really? I never heard that. Most people haven't. They, uh... They settled in the jungle near São Paulo. That's amazing. Uh... And this is a true story? Planted sugarcane. Their descendants still live there. Well, what's it called? Americana. Hmm. Well, I think it's a great idea. You should do it, no matter what happens. Junior year I told my father I was thinkin' of changin' majors to English. Hmm. What'd he say? [ Laughs ] He made it easy for me. Uh-huh. Major in pre-law or go on financial aid. Hmm. Well, I think you should write it now. In fact, if you don't, I will. You're not an intellectual property lawyer, are you? [ Both Laughing ] Ooh! Wow! Uh-huh! May I? Yeah. People comb this beach for years and never find one like that. So what's it worth? Well, nothing. You can buy one at any beach shop for two bucks. Finding it yourself is what makes it valuable. Good answer. Come on. [ Man ] Was that a heart attack? [ Chuckling ] Fire! Fire! You see Bart? He's got the flag. Fire! Up the hill! Up the hill! [ Heart Beating ] [ Heart Beating Stops ] [ Renny ] Good night, Jo. I'll, uh... I'll see you in the morning. [ Jo ] Good night. Renny. Can I have a word with you a minute? [ Sighs ] The meeting's being postponed till next weekend. I presume you want to be present to discuss the disbursement. Yes, sir. Well. I just can't believe he's gone. He truly was a sweet, sensitive soul. Please. My nanny used to read me Bible stories every mornin'. My favorite was the one about Joseph. In a jealous rage, his brothers threw him into a pit, tried to kill him. But he survived. And years later, when he was in charge of the whole country, they came and knelt before him, begging for their lives. Yeah. Power. True power is when your enemies beg down before you. [ Grunts ] [ Pats Renny's Leg ] You must take every opportunity, son. The world is about to be yours. Bart's gone. I'm glad you're here. Hey! Keep your voice down! Okay, okay. Okay. Keep your voice down. Bart Maxwell... He was with us, me and your dad. Have you tried to get any of your money yet? Yes. Did you get it? No. What stopped ya? Gettin' Mr. Larochette's permission. Exactly. Do you think he should have power of veto over what's rightfully ours? I don't know. I just want my money. Right. I'll be in touch. Here. Oh. Thanks. Hey, um, could we stop by the family cemetery on the way out? I just want to visit my father's grave again, and I don't know when I'm gonna be back. Sure. I'll meet you back here. Take your time. [ Bell Tolling ] I hope I didn't disturb you. Beautiful, aren't they? Made in Charleston, patterned after larger versions in a cathedral in France. Pretty fancy for a small church. They're magnificent. Hmm. Renny Jacobson. Michael Harriston. You the church historian? Uh, some might say so. You know, you pick up a lot by osmosis if you stay around long enough. You might remember my mother's family. The Candlers. Sure do. Good family. - You been to the plot recently? - Not since I was a little boy at my grandfather's funeral. Well, I can lead you right to it. [ Phone Camera Clicks ] [ Clicks ] [ Clicks ] "Dead at 33." Here you are. "Amos Candler. Though dead, he speaks." Was he a direct ancestor? Amos Candler? Why, he would have been your great-great-great grandfather. First Candler to settle around here. - Did the church put the flowers on the grave? - No, I did. Today's the anniversary of his death. I do a little something each year. He was as fit for heaven as anyone who ever set foot in the low country. Well, I'll leave you alone. No, I'm... I'm done. You know much about the Civil War? I know a little bit. I'm sure I probably had some ancestors fighting in it. I just... Hmm. I don't know. Probably so. You ever have dreams about the Civil War? I can't say that I have. I do. We were talkin' about Amos Candler. Now, Amos, he used to sit... at the end of the family pew, right there behind us, in the second row. He's probably lookin' over our shoulder right now. How's that? Part of the great cloud of witnesses. That's, uh... That's unsettling. [ Laughing ] Well, only if you got something to hide, which, of course, all people do. But I like to think of it as positive. You know, more like the... the home crowd... cheering you on at a... at a football game. So, if he were here, what would he be yelling from the grandstand? Given our surroundings and your pilgrimage, I'd say he'd probably be yellin', "Pray, Josiah! Pray!" Yeah. I don't know much about that. Mm-hmm. Well, supposedly, he... often left his pew... to go kneel and pray at that altar right there. You know, I should... I should be leavin'. Hmm. I'll pray for your journey, son. How'd you know my name was... Josiah? Hello? Hello! [ Jo ] Hey. Hey. Have you seen the caretaker? Was I supposed to? Question. Where can we find out more about your family? [ Car Doors Closing ] She practically raised me. Gave me the name Renny. Said I pecked at my food like a Carolina wren. Mama A. [ Laughing ] Oh! [ Laughing ] Mmm. Mama A, this is Jo. Oh, hello, children! Hi. Mmm. [ Mama A Laughing ] But you didn't come here for johnnycakes, now, did you, boy? What can you tell us about the Jacobsons? Sad tales. Well, you know, the old-time Jacobson, the one that made it through the war... J.F. Jeremiah. Now, as I recall, he was a... he was a rich planter before the war. Very successful. What became of him? Got himself killed in a bar fight. His son, Hiram, went crazy. Locked himself up in a room. Died from something they used to call the apoplexy. A stroke. Mm-hmm. Now, I knew your father's daddy personally... who was one unhappy man. He was lost on his yacht at sea, right? Left Charleston Harbor one bright, sunny day and never come back. After that, only your mama could reach your daddy. Seemed like he was mad at the whole wide world. And now him. Ah, it's just... just a tragedy, that whole Jacobson story. What about my mother's side, the Candlers? Not so much money, but a whole lot more happiness. I saw the Amos Candler monument. Hmm. Now, he was rich before the war. By the time it got into your mama's generation, all that money had done gone with the wind. What else do you know about my mother's family? Um, here. Your mama told me one day you'd come here, lookin' for answers about her family. And I knew today was that day. She wanted me to give you this. How did she know I was goin' to ask? [ Chuckles, Laughing ] [ Laughing Continues ] [ Woman's Voice ] Dear Renny, I have said prayers for you... that I believe will be answered after my death. The letter you hold in your hand is one of them. Son, your life has an ordained purpose. When you were born, I named you Josiah. Josiah was a king of Israel, a righteous man who confronted an ancient evil. I know this may sound strange and unusual to you, but I believe Josiah's call is similar to your own. There is more to life than we can see... with our natural eyes... or know with our finite minds. My prayers for you live on after I'm gone. All my love, Mother. Hey. Hey. Look, uh, today at the cemetery, I saw every List member in my family, and they all died really, really young, Renny. And just... Will you look? And then... And then there were all these... these baby crosses, and they're all over the place. I don't know, Jo, okay? I just, uh... But think about it. Your father, my father, Bart Maxwell. Something's wrong. I hear you. I do. I know you need to get back to Winston, Salem, but... I was hoping maybe you'd follow me to Charlotte. I'd really like to introduce you to my landlady, Mrs. Stokes. It's fine. She reminds me of Mama A. Yeah. Hickory nuts. Oh, thank you. Put 'em in hot water, boil 'em for 30 seconds to separate the meat. Thanks. Now, you... you be careful, son. Hmm. [ Renny ] Is it okay if Jo spends the night? My guest room's always available. Thanks, Mrs. Stokes. [ Ringing ] Ah! Barnette's office again. Here you go. Excuse me. So you were a missionary? Forty-five years. And is that your father? Mm-hmm. What was he like? He did his best. And yours? Absent. Leaves a hole, doesn't it? A big one. You know, years ago, I wrote down every disappointment on a piece of paper, forgave each one, and then burned them. [ Chuckles ] Now I can look at that picture... and smile. Hmm. This is where she prays. Can you tell Jo I'll be back in a few hours? Sure thing. So what do you think? She's great, but I don't think it really matters what I think now, does it? I'll be back soon. I'm sure you will. Morning. Jo, hey! It's Renny. No, everything's fine. Uh, listen. I wonder if you wouldn't mind staying at Mrs. Stokes's house just a couple more days. Really? Well, that... that'd be great. Okay, I'll, uh... I'll see you soon. All right, bye. I'm worried about him. Mm-hmm. I've prayed for a lot of people in that room, but recently it's Renny who keeps sending me back. I don't think you and I are worried for the same reasons. You wanna tell me? Good morning, Bonny. Good morning, Renny. Will you tell Barnette I got the signatures and I'll have the memo on Monday. Will do. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Is he here? Right behind you. Hey, Renny. Thomas. [ Chuckles ] Good to see you. I'm here on behalf of Gus Eicholtz. Let's get some air. How ya doin', darlin'? Gus says we can trust you on this matter. The Larochette family has maintained a tight grip on the List... and its funds for far too long. We now believe that Desmond and a couple of the others... are plotting to tip the scales even further in their favor. I don't understand, Thomas. The List has been going strong since the Civil War. Well, Taylor Johnston, a daughter. Bart Maxwell, no son. The power of attorney we all sign enables the List... to reclaim a member's money if he dies without a male heir. The power of attorney is invalid once a person dies. [ Laughs ] That's very true. Very true. So who's telling the Swiss bankers, hmm? Well, who gets the money? Larochette. You're kidding. From the beginning, that family's been in total control. And nobody, but nobody, crosses 'em. Till now. There's a plan in place, and you play a big part in it. Me? I saw the way you stood up for Miss Johnston the other night. You got a lot of guts, kid. We like that. As it stands now, there's eight voting members. But before we put a rubber stamp on Desmond's distribution plan, I want you to call for a vote to replace him as president. On what grounds? Well, you're an attorney. Be creative. If Desmond tries a power play, we'll come up with somethin'. All we need to act on this is a simple majority, and we'll have that. Now, Harry and Robert, well, they'll side with Desmond. That's no big surprise. But the others... well, the others are with me... with us. Who'll be the new president? Well, that would be me. And my first act as president will be to make a motion... for the distribution of the significantly larger sum of money... than any of us, except for Desmond, of course, has ever seen. Exactly... how large? [ Chuckles ] Does 30 million each work for you? [ Sighs ] My second act is to give that girl what is rightfully hers. You know, you guys, y'all keep telling me how great my father was. He was. Really? Really? Well, what kind of man disinherits his only son with no explanation whatsoever? Can you answer me that? I didn't think so. And Desmond Larochette has been the only person who has helped me so far. I'm gonna have to think about it. Well, I'm sure when the time comes, you'll make the right decision. [ Pats Leg ] Something I've learned, Jo, is that God's children and his enemies make the same mistake... they both underestimate the power of prayer. Let's keep praying. [ Phone Ringing ] Renny Jacobson. Renny, I want you to come out to dinner on Friday night. Yeah. Can you do that? Well, you can stay here the night. Right, no problem. Okay. Listen, I'm gonna put you on to Frank. He'll give you directions. I'll see you then. All right. Now, what have we got? You know, I like that Jacobson boy. [ Larochette ] Would you like a drink, Renny? Brandy's fine. Good. It's a brandy kind of room, isn't it? [ Laughs ] Well, down the hatch. Here's to all of us. Mmm. Do you play? From time to time. Ah. Mm-hmm. [ Typing ] Desmond Larochette. Right there. Let's see. A little castle here. Hmm. Very good. That's good. Interesting. All right now. Rook takes pawn. That would be checkmate. [ Chuckles ] Smart. Good. Good. Congratulations. Thank you. You know, Renny, the benefits of the List are many. A sense of belonging to history, to a brotherhood, loyalty. Prosperity. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. There's more to your inheritance than just money. It's called power, Renny. There's tremendous power in the List. It's something that your daddy knew about. It can either be used for good or for evil. [ Thunder Rumbling ] Come with me. Here, come here. Give me your hand a minute. Now... Yeah, nice and clean. Now, I want you to totally have your mind a blank. Touch this. Now, Renny. Is there someone in your life, someone whose heart you wanna touch? [ Thunderclap ] [ Panting ] Now just concentrate. Picture them, Renny. Picture them. See their face. [ Gasps ] Good, good, good. Now, release the power. [ Gasps ] Release the power and touch 'em! Yeah! Good. How do you feel? All right? Good. That's enough for tonight. Good night, gentlemen. Good night. Sleep well. Was it the girl? I think so. [ Laughs ] I like him. He's a good man. He's a good man. Jo? [ Phone Rings ] [ Line Rings ] [ Monitors Beeping ] [ Machine Pumping ] [ Sighs ] Yeah, right. Well, let me know as soon as escrow closes. Right. Oh, Renny. Here. Yeah, all right. I'll talk to ya later. All right, bye. Lawyers! Sit down. Ah, coffee? Please. Ah, well. Renny, I'm real proud of ya. Real proud of you. You did real well last night. It was exhilarating. Exhilarating? Yes, sir. Some milk? Please. Ah. I think it's time we had a money talk. Now I've decided, given the global economic picture, I think maybe we should hold off for a year or two. What do you say? Oh. You look disappointed. Uh, Mr. Larochette... Listen, son. I'm always gonna take care of you. I mean, there'll be tens of millions soon enough. Sugar? [ Daisy ] Help her, Lord. Heal her. Lord, please, help her. Help her. Help her. Heal her. Heal her. Heal her. Heal her. Help her. Help her, Lord, please. Heal her. Thomas! You were right. Of course I was. About what? No disbursement. All right, look. I'll do this on one condition. I get to be custodian, like my father, to keep the List. You serious? Of course I'm serious! [ Sighs ] All right. Done deal. All right, look. Before Desmond speaks, you have to make the motion. All right? All right. You okay with this? Yeah. All right. Give me a little head start. I don't want people to see us walk in together. [ Sighs ] [ Men Chattering ] [ Rapping ] Gentlemen, please. I'd like to call to order... the 248th meeting of the Covenant List of South Carolina, Limited. I'd like to make a motion. So be it, Renny. I move for the election of Thomas Layne as president of the List. - You are crazy! - The boy has every right. Is there a second? I second. - Discussion? - I realize I'm a new member, but I think there needs to be more openness about our finances... and a more liberal distribution of funds. Maintaining heavy central control is no longer necessary, gentlemen. This isn't 1863. Do not make his mistake. It's time for a change. Look at the small number in this room. You know it. I know it. He knows it. Don't be blinded by commitment to the past. Well, you can tell the man's a lawyer. [ Men Laughing ] Any other discussion? No? Right. Well, let's put it to the vote. All those in favor of Thomas Layne becoming president? One. [ Men Laughing ] You seconded the motion? Just so we could vote on it and move on. - I'm perfectly satisfied with Desmond's leadership. - Well... Thomas? Where did you come up with this bull? I can assure you I have never had any aspirations for that office. Never have, and I'd venture to say I never will. Oh, I see. This was a test. If you choose to call it that. Now, please be quiet. What on earth were you thinking, son? Now, as I was saying, the sole purpose of this meeting tonight is... to discuss the distribution of monies. Now I propose a distribution from... the corpus of the List to our individual accounts... excluding Renny here... to the sum of $30 million. - [ Men Murmuring ] - That's 30 million each, gentlemen. [ Men Chuckling ] As for Jacobson here, I move that we delay any payment of monies to him... for a probationary period of, say, 24 months. No... 36 months. I second. Hmm. [ Cell Phone Beeps ] Three missed calls. [ Monitors Beeping ] [ Daisy ] I ever tell you the story behind this picture? This is Vusi... Vusi Lakota. It was taken just outside of Cape Town. One day someone says there's a deadly black mamba in the bush... and that everyone must get inside. Panic. But not Vusi. He just calmly grabbed a shovel, headed straight into the bush. Thirty minutes later, he came out holding the dead mamba. That's when we took the picture. That night, I asked him why he did it. And he just said, "When you know evil exists, you must fight it." The ledger. [ Footsteps ] [ Men Chattering ] [ Footsteps ] [ Larochette ] Welcome back. [ Men Laughing ] Well, nice to see you again, Renny. Oh, thank you. I was just looking for that. Thank you. Gentlemen, would you mind giving us a minute? All right. Well, come with me. [ Laughs ] You cannot seize power, Renny. You have to be groomed for it. I didn't come here to steal it. What did you do to her? [ Chuckles ] Me? No. You did it. But that's all right. We can fix it because you are the key, Renny. How am I the key? There were 12 invitations... to the first meeting in 1863. Only one of the 12... a Judas... decided to go his own way. What does that have to do with Jo? Or me? Amos Candler. He foolishly then walked away. Your mother's family then faced financial ruin. But you... a Candler and a Jacobson... you complete the List. Now, you felt the power, right? How did you describe it? Oh, yeah. Exhilarating. It is written, "A cord of three strands... cannot easily be broken." Larochette, Candler, Jacobson. I can be the father that you so long for. What about Jo? Come on! That's no problem. No, she can be fine. That can be part of our pilgrimage together. How? Unity. It's time for the Candler and the Jacobson blood to join. And it's time for you to stand up and be a man! It's time for you to make your mark! And unlike your daddy, I will be here for you. All right. All right. All right. I'm out! It's over. You better think about our future, boy. Trust me, I have. Someone with your potential... doesn't come along but once in the generations. But let me tell you this. Before this is over, you're gonna be beggin' for mercy. Call the police. We have an intruder. [ Chuckles ] Jacobson, your lawyer's here. [ Door Closes ] A.L. Jenkins. You can thank Mama A for bringing me down here. That doesn't mean I'm staying. You got four charges facing you. Criminal trespass, possession of burglary tools, criminal damage to property and attempted burglary. That last one's a felony. And, uh, your law firm just called the desk sergeant. - You're fired. - [ Scoffs ] You got one hour. [ Slams Watch On Table ] ♪♪♪ [ Vocalizing ] ♪♪♪ [ Humming ] [ Humming Stops ] Oh, Father, God, you got to do something about Renny now. I can't help him no more. I can't. [ Monitors Beeping ] [ Mama A ] You see the trouble he in. His mommy and daddy leave me to care for him. But he needs you, Jesus. I can't help him no more. He in this mess and he in this trouble, but, Lord, he just need to know you, Jesus. Help him, Lord. Help my Renny. Help my baby boy. Oh, Lord. ♪♪♪ [ Humming ] ♪♪♪ [ Vocalizing ] Save his soul. [ Sobbing ] Is that it? Yeah. You got any evidence? No. I mean, uh, nothing except three dead, a woman in the hospital, and me stuck here about to lose everything. What do you want, son? What do I want? Well, let's see. I want the money. I want the girl. And I want no criminal record. [ Laughs ] Okay. No problem. Let's just call Desmond Larochette. I'm sure he'll be willing to drop the charges and take you under his wing. What do you really want? [ Sighs ] I want Jo to be okay. I want no jail time. And I would just like... to start over. Now, that's better. We've got problems legal and spiritual, but we can handle both. First, let's just face Judge Austin. Let's post bail. Great. [ Voice Whispering ] Larochette. [ Cocks Gun ] Who's there? [ Sets Gun On Desk ] Who are you? [ Voice Whispering Indistinctly ] What do you want? [ Voice Whispering Indistinctly ] [ Chuckles ] [ Gasps ] [ Heart Beating ] Renny! Oh, shoot. Renny. [ Female Voice Screams ] What is this, Lord? Victory? What do I need to do? My strength is almost gone. "For I am poured out like a drink offering, "and the time for my departure has come. "I have fought the good fight. "I have finished the race. I have kept the faith." [ Closes Book ] Do you understand that with a guilty plea to these charges, you'll never practice law again? Yes, Your Honor, I understand. Mr. Jacobson, you are hereby sentenced... to three years confinement in the South Carolina State Penitentiary. [ Gasps ] Said sentence to be served on probation. I further order you not to go on or about... the person or the property of Desmond Larochette. I hope you get your life together, son. - Court adjourned. - [ Gavel Raps ] Well, that's one of your problems solved. Disbarment? [ Pats Back ] But no jail time. Let's walk outta here. Robert, inform the members... that there'll be a special meeting tomorrow night! So how do we handle Gus? Something unique would be nice. I called the hospital. She's still hanging on. I'm surprised she's not dead. Ah. The others submitted to the power of the List. But don't worry. I've seen the end right from the beginning. I call that my wall of faith. Look at their eyes. Before God got hold of them... and after. All those people had one thing in common... they thought they were 1,000 miles from the promised land. Truth is, they was just one step away. [ Mama A ] Amen. [ Daisy's Voice, Overlapping ] "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want." Heal her. "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures"... Heal her. "And leadeth me beside the still waters." Heal her. "He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for his namesake." Surrender. "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil"... Surrender. Strength. "For thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. "He preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. "Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup overflows. "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." [ Crying ] [ Thunderclap ] Yes! Yes, I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God... visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children... unto the third and the fourth generation of them that hate me, and showing mercy... unto the thousands of them that love me... and keep my commandments. This is what the Lord said. I've got something to say. I kept asking myself, "Why?" Why did my father leave me nothin'? Why did you trick me? And why did all this have to happen? And then I realized... you're all blind. My father. You, Larochette. [ Chuckles ] Even you, Gus. You're all blinded by this. You're nothing but a bunch of selfish, greedy old men. And I don't want any part of it. Whatever has happened in the past, whatever will happen from this point forward, your power over me, over my family, over the people I love, ends now! [ Gasps ] [ Keys Jangle ] He signed in blood. I own him. [ Larochette ] Power? I'll show you power. Blessing. Blessing. Bless... [ Crying ] [ Sighs ] What's this? It's Daisy's holographic will. Her what? It's a will in her own handwriting. She wrote it four days ago. Perfectly legal. Believe me, I should know. Renny, she gave you the house. She gave me a lot more than that. They all did. So why weren't you? Why wasn't I what? Crying. Why were you? My entire life I've been looking for my father. So, when we buried him, that was it. You know? I'd never know him. But... here, with Mrs. Stokes, I think I found what it is I'm looking for. Thank you. Isn't it gorgeous? Yes, it is. This place kind of reminds me of Lake Moultrie in Charleston where I grew up. I was... five years old, I guess, the first time my parents brought me there. It's where my father taught me to swim. I was horrible at it too. I mean, I'd struggle in the water, flailing my arms, trying anything I could just to stay afloat. My mother, she'd stand on the bank, lookin' down. She'd just pray. Jo. [ Daisy's Voice ] There is something I've learned, Jo. God's children and his enemies... both make the same mistake... they both underestimate the power of prayer. Let's keep praying.
