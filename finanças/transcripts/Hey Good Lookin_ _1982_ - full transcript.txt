Hey, Garbage. How long we know each other now, huh? About 6 weeks, Charlie... And it's been a gas. You know, you and me and all this rubble. Just passing time bullshittin'. It's been good, but I'm starting to feel my age now... and I'm looking forward, you know, to my final resting place. So I can relax and not have any rats chewin' at me anymore. You know what I mean? Yeah, you and your heaven again. You sure that this heaven is all that's cracked up to be? Hey, what's wrong with 'cha? Ain't you a believer? I used to be, but... I don't know anymore. You can't be too careful what you believe in, nowadays. Always a cynic, Charlie. You gotta believe, you gotta believe! Hey, what's that loud noise?! That's it! That's it! - What? - Just like the great book says. - What's it? - God comes with a rumble. Picks ya up and carries ya away. Goodbye, Charlie. I'm going to my rest. Sunshines, trees... Goodbye, Charlie! Goodbye! Fuck this city! He.. hey. Hi, girl... What are you doin' out alone so late? Lucky for you, I'm a nice kinda guy. What are ya starin' at? Oh yeah, yeah. I know. I'm cool.

Oh, what have you got there? Does it still shine? Is it pretty? Is it old? Does it bring back memories? Come on, don't cry. Give it back to me. We can talk about it, come on. Give it back to me! That's it. Oh, look at that. Do you know what that is? No? Here, smell it. Take it. It's a black jacket, right. Yeah, yeah. That's it. That's it. Kiss it, like it, love it. Etica, that's it. Oh, boy!

Oh, and you had to have the best D.A. in the whole neighborhood. Yeah, seein' now. That was really important. It counts, you know? Vinnie's best friend was Crazy Shapiro. Hey, what's this? What? My zoot suit? I gotta get my suits outta here. I hate that ugly kid of mine. No one was surprised at that shooting 'cause Crazy's pop was Saulie the Cop. Are ya in yet? Did you hear about Brenda's ring? One half carats with baguette. I heard Mickey knocked her up. The wedding... Alright? Okay? - Okay. - Tell me. - Alright, like this. - Alright? Alright. When I'm up on the roof. If by nothing can touch me. You know, it's all so quiet and beautiful... with the whole city right out in front of my eyes. So what? Well, sometimes. I want to draw a picture of it. A picture? Hey, hey, Norman Rockwell. Draw me a picture. Here, c'mon, c'mon. Draw me a picture. I can't draw. It's just like I feel like it, sometimes.

They don't wear no black jackets, they wear scars. Oh, if these guys see us, we're dead. Crazy... Fuck! Crazy! - Where did you go? - Well, then we went on a cruise. - It was nice. - My husband never took me on a cruise. - Watch your bed. You guys are in very big trouble. I'm givin' you one more chance. You better let me up, right now. You let me up or I'm gonna tear your nose off your face. Think, I smell... Hey, Mr. Boogaloo. - I've been lookin' for you... Hey. - Hey, baby. What's happenin'?

It's official business. - Official business. - Right? - Right. - Right. Hey, wait a minute? What kind of official business? There's one kind of official business. That's the rumble. It ain't like the Chaplains to be ungang-like. So, Vinnie here is gonna let us know the time and the place. Yeah, time and the place. - And the weapons, and shit like that. - And the weapons... - Right, Vinnie? And if your gang don't want to rumble... you gonna have to fight us all, yourself.

If you really ever looked at Vinnie's shape. I think Vinnie's so beautiful. I think he's so exciting-looking... And when he gets angry. When he... Oh god, when he gets angry... I could die. Could you die, then? Oh god, the way his mouth just... - ...just curls up at the end, you know? - Oh, that curl. Those teeth. I have never seen such teeth in my life. You know, if he saw you in that bathing suit, he'd drop dead. - You really think so? - He would just drop dead. - Are you serious? - You look so terrific and that... What do you think? You think I look alright? - You look fine. - I'm losing weight, you think so? Well, um... Yeah, right here on the side. - I'm losing a little weight. - It looks a little thinner on the side. Yeah, because I've been making my sandwiches a little smaller. Do you think this color's right for me? I think you look so beautiful, I could drop dead. - Do you think Vinnie would like this color? - I mean, you look really... I mean, this is a drop dead bathing suit you're wearing. - You really think so? - If he saw you today, he would die. Eva. Eva, hold my hand. I can't stand it. Oh my god, Evie. He's comin' down the beach. Look at him. Look at him. I can't stand it! Oh, hold my hand. I think I'm gonna go to pieces. - Oh god, he's wearin' the pants. - I think I'm gonna be sick. - Damn, just what am I gonna do? - Wait a second. - What should I do? - Make some sandwiches. What kind does he like? Um, anything. Put a lot of onions on. - He loves onion. - I was in real trouble. I mean, this was serious. I had to get my gang, the Stompers, to fight the black Chaplains... ...or I was gonna have to fight them all alone. And that was no bullshit. And I was scared, but cool. Want a liverwurst sandwich? Let it be... All your faith in me... Vinnie, this is my song to you. From Rozzie to Vinnie with undying love. When two hearts meet, they're one. Hi, Vinnie. Hey, kid. How's it goin'?

Let me help you with your hamburgers. Where you been? Your food's gettin' cold. Well, as you know, I went to the little girl's room. By the way, Eva. Did I ever tell you, you got some keen hamburgers? Oh, I know. They got lettuce, tomatoes, cheese... I love those hamburgers. I love to eat them... hamburgers. Hey. Excuse me, Crazy. - But wouldn't be easier... - If I ate the french fries? - French Fries! - Crazy! French fries! Hey, Jesus Christ. I don't believe that guy. - You believe that? - I don't know. It's that kind of unusual. Onions! - Tomatoes! - Tomatoes? Hey, Vinnie. You got the five and a half ready? Did uh...he say some of that five and half? No, no, no. He meant ten and a half. Ten and a half. Boy, I sure love these hamburgers. Oh my God. - I'll see you around. - Crazy! - He's like the last of the Mohicans. - He's like a savage. - An animal. Hey! You want me to break it up, Roz? Is it disgusting? Vinnie, let's not talk about them. They can work it out. I'm sure. Yeah. Eve is a big girl. - Hey uh... You know, kid. - Yeah, Vinnie. Want you to know somethin'. - Yeah, Vinnie? - C'mere. C'mere. - You're really swell, Vinnie. You know? - Yeah, you think so? I think you're drunk. Hey, come here. I ain't drunk. - Hey, Vinnie! - Come here. - It's him! - Who? It's Boogaloo. It's Boo-lagoo. Boo-lagoo? Hey, what's a Boo-lagoo? That spook who ran us down. He's turning into the drive-in. - I say, let's get him. - Hey, hey. Lighten' up, will ya? You mean, Boogaloo. That ain't Boogaloo. Boogaloo? Where is that son of a bitch? Hey, man. That ain't Boogaloo. Who cares? They're jungle bunnies, ain't they? Let's get 'em. I don't understand. Meatloafs are like people. Hey, man. What are these dudes doing? I don't know, man, but we better get back to our neighborhood. Yeah, you got that right. Let's get the hell out of here. What are you lettin' them go for, Crazy? Ain't a bad idea lettin' them go, you know? Man, I ain't lettin' no one go. Just watch old Crazy Shapiro. Hey, shit for brains. What about weapons? I'll show you weapons, man. - Vinnie don't need weapons. - Yeah, that's right. Rozzie, do you think anybody'd mind if I hid under the dashboard for now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come out and play, jungle bunnies. Hey, Chaplains. I really got ya, huh? Hey, you're Crazy. Sounds like we got gas to me, man. - He must be loaded. - I don't care what it is, man, but shit. Oh, woah. Look at the nasty old chains. Man, I'm really scared shitless. Hey, Chaplains... Eat this. Boo-yeah! Hey, man. Why don't you get your say now, huh? Come on, get up. Vinnie! - This guy's a really... - You crazy freako. Come on, chickenshit. You fucking maniac! God damn it! You lousy creep. I'm gonna kill you for that. Put the gun down. Put the fucking gun down! You're gonna die, shit for brains. Right now. Don't... Don't. Oh, man. Did I scare the shit out of you? Look, it's empty. Jesus! They're dead. Hey, they're dead. Come on, Crazy. Let's get out of here. Hey, Roz? Did you see the funny way I scared Vinnie? - You're a fuckin' riot! - Come on, Vinnie. Come on, Vinnie. Get in the car and let's get out of here. Rozzie, the guys are dead. We can't just get out of here. The guys are dead. There's nothing we can do. Get rid of the gun and get behind the wheel and drive. What happened? Nothing happened. Nothing, you didn't see nothin'. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. - What happened?! What happened?! What are we gonna do? Oh, Jesus! Wow, that was incredible, Crazy! Shmuck! Hello, Boogaloo. You know these boys? Yeah, they were choir boys in my church. Don't wise-ass me, punk. I know those boys are Chaplains. Why ask me? 'Cause I want the young punks that shot 'em. What for? They was just two dead niggas. Why bother? You might be right... But when I find the black gang that shot 'em... It means I might get a chance to blast some Chaplains. And you know that I look forward to doing that. Chaplains don't waste their bullets on themselves, man. Tell the motherfucker. Yeah, who did those Chaplains waste their bullets on? We waste them on Stompers, man. You know, the other guys with guns. The gang that your son's a member too. I got it. Let's go, Mac. Hey, Mac. Did you see me scare the shit out of those Chaplains? Heh, Let's go. Bam, bam! You're done, Mack. Hey, Rozzie? Where'd Vinnie go? He's leavin' town. Leaving? Why didn't he ask me to go with him? Uh... Hey, Crazy! Who's this? The black Chaplains uh... stopped me on the beach. Seein' as I was just uh... looking down to pick up some chicks, you know. Now, uh... our honor's at stake. I uh, call uh, I'm calling for a rumble with the Chaplains to protect our honor. Yeah, yeah. It's good. It's good. Hey, Rozzie. Rozzie, dig this. Uh, you want me to break it up, Roz? Is it disgusting? Uh, Crazy is the uh... last of the Mohicans. A true savage. Well, I guess this uh... this makes me the leader of the Stompers, huh? I guess it does. What's that? - It's my crazy pop. - Who? My cop father. What the hell is he doin' down here. - I gotta see what he wants. - I gotta get outta here. Hey, pop. I thought that was you. What are you doin' down here? - You finished? - Yeah. Yeah. Tell me! Tell me who did it! Tell me. Stay away from me. Stay away from me, you fucker. Tell me who did it! Tell me. Tell me. Tell me! Tell me. Vinnie did it. Where you guys been? Where you guys been?! I thought I'm gonna have to fight them myself. I've been waitin' here for an hour and an half. Hey, you know... Them fuckin' niggas. They ain't gonna show. They know better, you know what I mean? Oh, shit! They're there. Okay, uh... You guys ready? You got the rhythm? Hey, wait a minute. Boogaloo ain't there. - We ain't fightin' without Boogaloo - Shit, that's what we're here for. - We ain't gonna fight without Boogaloo, so... - Knocking off some fucking heads off... Stay loose and I'll be right back. I ain't coming the Stompers to a rumble as long as Boogaloo ain't here. If Boogaloo ain't fuckin' showing, your rumble is off. These guys are really good. Alright, Vinnie. Get your hands up. Hey, Saulie. I ain't arguing. Believe me, I ain't gonna argue with you. Keep your ass right down there, Vinnie. Hey. I got nowhere to go, Saulie. Believe me. You squealed and told on Vinnie! You squealed! Oh, Vinnie. Alright, Vinnie. It's all over, stand up. Son of a bitch! Stop Vinnie or I'll shoot. Vinnie, stop! Mama! Vinnie! Hello, Mr. Freed... Yeah, I'll... I'll wait. Oh, uh... Hello, Mr. Freed. Hi, I like to dedicate uh... To... Vinnie, leader of the Brooklyn Stompers. For Rozzie, with an undying love. Hey, good lookin'. You made it. Because it's your precious love, this is my story. And you can always... See, baby... Vinnie could do no less than leave town. Seeing as he was heartbroken over Crazy's death. You're full of crap. I ain't buyin' that, Vinnie. Yeah, you're Vinnie and I'm Rozzie. Maybe, we ain't foolin' each other. You chickened out! Ya left me! You never wanted to rumble. Crazy had more balls than you ever had. I loved you and you let me down. But guess what... You know what we're doin' here? Do you know, big shot? Well, any second, my husband walkin' through that door. He's an animal, Vinnie. A giant. And he hates me drinking with anyone, but him. So... So... You're gonna have to fight him, baby. You... You're gonna hafta... You're gonna get your second chance. 'Cause I'm givin' it to ya. So kick ass for me, Vinnie. 'Kay? Be a man. Hey, if there's one thing we learned then, that's still true now... If you turn a woman upside down... They all look alike, so why bother? Hey, kid. How's it goin'? I've been waitin' for ya. C'mere.
