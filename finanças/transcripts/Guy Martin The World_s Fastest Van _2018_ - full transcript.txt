NARRATOR: This is the legendary Ntirburgring circuit in Germany. ENGINE STARTS Guy Martin has come here with his favourite transit van. And on this track, he'll attempt to break two records. That's the plan, but it's not gonna go to plan, is it? Course it's not gonna go to plan, we all know that. NARRATOR: Guy's hoping today will be the successful finale to a story that began over three years ago, in September, 2015 Guy crashed his favourite transit van on the way to work and wrote it off. Gutted. Love that van. NARRATOR: But rather than letting it go to the breaker's yard”. GUY: I bought it back off the insurance company for 900 quid. PAUL: You were robbed! You what? You what? - THEY LAUGH There's two new back tyres on it! NARRATOR: Guy decided to rebuild it, GUY: Un-write it off. If that's un-writer-off-able. NARRATOR: Rebuild it, and make It better than it was before, Better, stronger, faster,. GUY: Sounds a treat, don't it? NARRATOR: He wanted to build the world's fastest van, GUY: It's not just fast for a van, it is fast. NARRATOR: Once finished, Guy took his van to the States and entered the world's fastest road race. Successfully driving 90 miles across the Nevada Desert... at massive speeds, MAN ON HANG: 164 miles an hour! One mad Englishman coming over in a work van. MAN: Yeah. - THEY LAUGH NARRATOR: Even though he didn't win the race going from write-off to blisteringly fast racing machine in just a few months was a massive achievement. My bag's in the back. Hey, in the van. - MAN: Yeah? NARRATOR: But now Guy wants more, Fast van, but... we didn't really set any records with it. It wasn't the world's fastest van. We did feel at the end of it we've got unfinished business. NARRATOR: Guy wants to prove beyond all doubt that his transit van is the fastest in the world,. GUY: We're going for two world records, the world's fastest transit van outright speed, and the world's fastest lap around the NUrburgring. Van, fastest lap... commercial vehicle, but whatever you wanna word, it's the world... Yeah, fastest van around the Nfirburgring. NARRATOR: The Nflrburgring is the most difficult.,. demanding,., and dangerous motor racing circuit on Earth,. And to stand a chance of setting a lap record there Guy has months of work ahead,,,. GUY: The transit has sort of taken over me life. NARRATOR: He-engineering almost every part of his van, Aye, but it's what I like, innit? It's wrecking stuff in your shed. NARRATOR: Learning the 12.9 mile circuit and every one of its hundred plus bends by heart”. GUY: Oh, that's... like that? Not like that. HE LAUGHS NARRATOR: Using every trick In the book to give him the edge. And she says, "Yeah, that were the co-ordination from me tid welding." So I thought, "Oh, yeah, I need a bit of that." NARRATOR: And then heading to Germany to prove he owns the world's best transit... pushing him and his van to the absolute limit,” Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop! NARRATOR: ”and possibly beyond, DAN: There's flames at the back of the car! NARRATOR: Straight after the Nevada road race before his van had even left America Guy saw an opportunity to bag the world speed record for a transit van at the home of speed,,, the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. GUY: The van was only at Ely, which was a couple... three hours away. Got the van up there and I thought, "Oh, yeah, yeah, we'll just... foot to the boards, go down there, break the record. Job's a peach, all the way home." NARRATOR: For over 100 years Bonneville has been the place to come to break world speed records. Hundreds have been set and broken here. Now Guy's keen to join the roll call of salt flat record holders. Helping Guy are motorsport engineer, Brian Schaefer and data technician, James Scott. Their target... for Guy to hit a top speed on the salt of 177 miles per hour, The current record holder is Super Van II and he did it in 1984, so that's 32 year ago. The record was set using a 3.9 litre Cosworth V8 making 590 horsepower, so that's going some. And it looks like a transit van but it's not a transit van. It was seven-tenths size with a mid-mounted engine, and a fiberglass shell. NARRATOR: While everyone agrees that Super Van H is the vehicle that holds the record there is some dispute as to what that record is. Some people say the record is 174 miles an hour. Some people say it was Martin Brundle down Hangar Straight that did 176 miles per hour. Soto be sure, we need to do 177 miles per hour. We'll be right. JAMES: So, we've got quite a lot of salt today. We've got a long stretch where we've got five mile to run on. Timing gate right at the end so we'll know our final speed there. NARRATOR: Guy's first run will be at relatively low speed, GUY: That us? Looking forward to it. Come on then, give me a helmet. NARRATOR: Called a shake-down it's used to ensure the van is working correctly and also allow Guy to assess how the van behaves on this new surface, ENGINE STARTS NARRATOR: As Guy reaches 140 miles per hour it's apparent that the van is behaving very differently. GUY: It didn't feel that stable. Just felt really sort of nervous on the salt. It just felt to be floating on the top of it. NARRATOR: The van's tyres are designed to work on tarmac, When looked at In close-up, tarmac has a rough surface. The rubber tyres of a car fold around this and that's what allows them to grip a road so we“, The larger the contact area, the more grip,. While the surface of the satt flats looks similarly rough in close-up it's a lot more brittle and is covered with a layer of loose granular dust, Guy's relatively wide road tyres can't out through the dusty, brittle surface preventing them from gaining sufficient grip to use all the van's power, To overcome this, purpose-built salt flat racers don't have wide tyres, GUY: Bonneville racers have real thin tyres so the tyre digs through the salt, the loose salt, and gets to the hard stuff. And that's where the traction comes from, that's where you get your traction. GUY: She's a bit lively. - MAN LAUGHS GUY: But you wouldn't think, would you? You're not, like... but you... you're... you're playing with it. NARRATOR: As changing the van's tyres is not an option the team decide their only throw of the dice is to find more power, New data for the engine's electronic control system known as an engine map is emailed over from the factory in England and loaded into the van. These boys haven't pushed this engine that far yet so we're going into the unknown, and she might chuck a rod out. Oh, well, we're here for one reason, aren't we? We're here to go fast. NARRATOR: To eke out every extra mile per hour he can Guy reduces a bit of the drag on his van by removing the lip from the rear wing,. R's amt un... it's a bit unstable, so I'm gonna put me, um... me HANS device on. Just in case. It's to stop me, um... head falling off me body. Y-y-your shoulder straps go... go there, and then... you see? Better safe than sorry. HE CHUCKLES I don't wanna lose me head. What am I gonna do? HE LAUGHS Go on, let's give it a go. NARRATOR: At the end of his five-mile run Guy flies through the timing gate,. So, does he now own the world's fastest transit van? Now then, Alan, are you there? NARRATOR: Did he reach 177 miles per hour? MAN ON RAND: Timing stand here. It's Guy and James here, what was the speed of the van, mate? What was the top speed of it? MAN ON RAND: Top speed, 163,175 miles per hour. 1-6-3 point 1-7-5,. Hey, thanks very much, mate, cheers. Cheers. What do you think? MAN ON RAND: Thank you, nice, good”. Nice job, GUY: 163.175. Not what we wanted, is it? - No. Hmm. It... it's gotta be the salt, hasn't it? Gotta be the... the width of the tyres on the salt. It is, yeah. I mean, tarmac, we're alright. You know, it'll go quicker. It's just the only we'll change is what we're running on. GUY: Yeah. Yeah, which is salt, not tarmac. GUY: I suppose you could say it's fastest van on the salt. You could say that, couldn't you? You could say that. We weren't here for that, really. We just wanted to be the fastest outright van. Oh, well, back to the drawing board. NARRATOR: Guy Martin has built a very fast van but it's yet to win anything,. It failed to win the Nevada Open Road Challenge and it failed to set a new transit van speed record at Bonneville. Now, Guy wants to totally re-engineer the van not only to make another attempt at the speed record but also to break the van lap record at the legendary NUrburgring, However, since Guy and his van returned from America life's been a bit busy, GUY: Had a baby, moved house started a new job, been to China... been to Russia for a month, built a World War I tank went racing for Honda for a year, which I shouldn't really have done. Yeah, did that. That was last year, weren't it? 2017. Went endurance racing, classic endurance racing. Me and a few mates did that. Went spannering for Williams at Spa... been on holiday. Sharon says that weren't a holiday, I said it was an holiday. We managed three days in Monkey World. NARRATOR: Finally, in April this year Guy decided the van project couldn't wait any longer. It had come back from America, I didn't have room for it so it went to a museum in Scotland, it'd been there for a year. And then I thought, I'll get it back, muck about with it a bit so I planned this track day at Cadwell with all the original build crew. Dan and Paul from Crazy Horse, James from Radical and it was great, great to meet everyone cos they're bloody knowledgeable buggers. NARRATOR: The plan [5 to put in a few laps to see how a van built purely for straight line speed handles round corners. JAMES: Is it as we packed it up in the States? - GUY: Yeah. There's your suitcase in here still, Dan. NARRATOR: First job, though, is to see if it'll start,. Right, shall we try that? Yeah? - ENGINE STUTTERS ENGINE ROARS - Oh. DAN: Sounds good to me. GUY: Yeah, it goes a treat. We might need some more petrol, though. That's the trick, and it started straight away. Yeah, what are we looking like, boss? We look fine, yeah, all sensors still reading. Engine's still running nice. - GUY: Yeah. JAMES: So we should be good to go, test it round the track and... and see how it pulls. - GUY: Yeah, spot on. NARRATOR: Guy and Dan head out onto the circuit, GUY: I had to put an hair net on because whoever wears the helmet next they might catch summat off me hair. I wouldn't dare, you might catch foot and mouth. HE CHUCKLES NARRATOR: This will be the first time the van has ever been driven on a proper race track. As well as only being a few miles from Guy's house Cadwe/I Park Is the ideal test circuit for the project because it has lots of elevation changes wooded sections... and fast bends earning its nickname ”the Mini Niirburgring”, GUY: Drove it round Cadwell and it was better than I thought. It... it weren't great. It weren't great, I mean, gear box weren't very good. GEARS CRUNCH Oh... GUY: Massive weight, at times like it was gonna be a ship at sea. GUY LAUGHS GUY: You've got that big body roll of getting it to the car when you've got it committed, it's alright. GUY: We'll be getting a bit wild, innit? GUY LAUGHS AM there for using! TYRES SQUEAL THEY LAUGH I was asking for that, weren't I? GUY: We didn't do a fantastic lap time. What did we do? About a one minute 50-something, But it was alright. It was alright. NARRATOR: Next, the team sit down to make a plan and they're joined by aero expert Rob Rowseu from Wirth Engineering, first, they all watch the lap record Guy wants to beat, Bloody hell! He looks very professional, doesn't he? NARRATOR: It was set in 2013 by Nurburgring expert, Dale Lamas in a modified Volkswagen 75 van, GUY: He ain't backing off a lot for that, is he? He's fairly committed to the job! NARRATOR: Dale's record time which Guy will need to beat, is nine minutes and 57 seconds. Yeah, so go on. So, right, obviously, we wanna break the NUrburgring record. He does know where he's going, though, don't he? That's not gonna be easy, is it? NARRATOR: One lap of the Infamous Niirburgr/ng is almost 13 miles long with 100 plus different corners, GUY: Right, so where are we starting? Starting here. ROB: Start... the actual start-finish line is down there. - GUY: Oh, right. NARRATOR: Guy will have to learn every turn, bump and line by heart, GUY: What did it take me to learn the TT course? Three years. NARRATOR: So, could Guy bag both the van lap record and the outright transit speed record in the same run around the Nfirburgring? This is only two kilometre straight, but... you've got a lot of power, I mean... - GUY: More power. I think it'd be definitely worth attempting it there. - GUY: Yeah? DAN: I mean, you might run out of road but it's a nice bit of smooth tarmac on a race track. - GUY: Mm-hm. NARRATOR: Guy's van won't be struggling for power which is great for the straight line speed record. GUY: You reckon it's about 700 horsepower? - ROB: About 700, yeah. NARRATOR: But for the lap record, It needs to go on a diet, It is an heavy old pig, isn't it? What is it, 2,200 kilograms? The windows could be changed for plastic. NARRATOR: it doesn't accelerate consistently,” The gearbox is terrible. Well, we knew that, didn't we? DAN: We knew the gearbox was terrible. - We knew that. NARRATOR: ”and it doesn't handle we" around comers. The quicker you can go round the corners, the quicker you come out the exit the quicker you're going down the straight. - GUY: Yeah. NARRATOR: After ah hour or so, the team think they've worked out how to build a van capable of breaking both records. However, this time, how the van gets bum is going to be a bit different, in America, Guy got frustrated, As the driver, he had to stay in Las Vegas while all the last minute work on the van was done by other people, Hello? GUY: I'm just jealous of Dan, getting stuck in and doing the job. But I want me cake and I wanna eat it, because I wanna drive it as well. NARRATOR: This time,., he wants the van to be all his own work. I decided, yeah, I wanna build it, so... I'm doing all the work. I've got a couple of mates. Plenty of cups of tea. It's happening, it's happening. Great. NARRATOR: With girlfriend Sharon acting as camera operator Guy gets stuck in and he has an idea,. You know what would be it? Just put the engine in the back. Put the engine in the back, yeah. This isn't good for you cos this is gonna be more time in the shed. The basic engine will just move in a lump six foot back like you see here. SHARON: What, what have I done? I've just zoomed! Oh, Christ, you're really big on the screen! How do I go out? How do I zoom out? You got it? - SHARON: Oh, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Put bracket under the chassis, cut the floor out, um... All that handbrake stuff can be sorted out later. The biggest thing is gonna be getting the pipe work to the front. Yeah, but I'm not shy of a challenge, am I? SHARON: No. - You'll have to keep the teas coming. SHARON: Great. - Them dogs are falling out. Why them dogs falling out? Hey, go on, hey, hey. Nige! Nigel SHARON CHUCKLES - Steve! Nigel No! - DOGS WHINE GUY: They listen to the boss, don't they, eh? SHARON: Come on, back to the van. - GUY: They listen to the boss. GUY: When we've got the engine in the back the centre of mass is gonna be in the middle of the van rather than hung over the front axle. It's gonna be fair more controllable it gives us a better gearbox option, loads more space we can get that van to its potential. GUY: Turn the van round, take the back doors off. SHARON: Is this a stupid question? - Go on. How you gonna turn the van around now there's no engine in it now? You're gonna shove it. - SHARON: Oh. SHARON: God, I'm such a lucky girl! NARRATOR: Having turned the van around next job is to cut out the floor where the engine will fit and for that, Guy's recruited a couple of mates, Tim Grey and Uncle Rodders, Uncle Rodders, who's not me uncle been me Uncle Rodders for... Oh, since I remember. Real good blacksmith, shoes horses, but retired now, so any job that I've got on any project, he always wants to be, "What you doing, what you doing?" Tim Grey, he's a farmer, really. He used to build muck Spreaders. He's a proper yacker, proper yacker and he just... nuts and bolts bit of a tape measure, cup of tea. He's a good, good bloke, good bloke. NARRATOR: It's no coincidence that most purpose-bum racing cars and high-end sports cars are mid-engined, GUY: Now we're in, now, aren't we? NARRATOR: Moving the engine from the front to the centre of the van should Improve Its performance In a number of ways. It will mean the van's weight is more evenly distributed across all four wheels improving the van's balance when cornering or braking, It puts more weight over the rear axle, and because Guy's van is rear-wheel drive that should help improve power delivery and acceleration, And it can lower the van's centre of gravity, because the engine can be mounted lower down making the whole vehicle more stable, Great to see it now with the floor cut out, the engine sat in. There's nothing that's happened today to say, "Well, this can't happen," cos it can. Obviously, it isn't gonna be easy, is it? Of course it's not gonna be easy. If it was easy, someone would've done it by now and they haven't done it, have they? It's in me shed, we're making stuff, that's what I do, that's what I do. That's what I do, it's great. SHARON: Steve, have you got fleas? NARRATOR: Guy Martin is building what he wants to be the world's fastest transit van. Well, the transit has sort of taken over me life. GUY: Go film me welding on the manifold. Go film me welding on the manifold. SHARON WHISPERS: What's a manifold? SHE LAUGHS Steve, what's a manifold? NARRATOR: When it's finished, he wants it to be the fastest transit ever in a straight line, But even more challenging,,,. He also wants it to be the fastest van ever around this place”. The Niirburgring, Nordschleife, At 129 miles long, with over 100 corners very time run-off, and no forgiving Armco everywhere it's the most challenging, dangerous and addictive motor racing circuit in the world,. There is simply nowhere else quite like the Nurburgring,. In its illustrious 90-year history the track's claimed the lives of many who have tried to master it, Some estimates put the number of fatalities at well over 200, tt's a gruemng and severe challenge for any car and that's why the world's reading manufacturers pay millions to come here and push their prototypes to the limit,. And it's a mecca for car fans because every weekday evening and on some weekends the track becomes a one-way to" road,. Once you've paid the to", you can drive it in whatever you want,” as fast as you want, GUY: How long you been coming to the Nfirburgring then? I come here from '87. Did you move over here because of the track? - Yeah. How long have you lived here? - Two years. Two years now. No regrets? No, nothing. I mean, I've done it year on year. - GUY: Right. There's nothing compares to it. Been coming here for 16 years. - 16 years? Bloody hell! MAN: If you're local, it's like, yeah, get up in the morning, seven o'clock. Get the car ready, 7:30. On the track, eight. Fair play, 20 years of it? - Yeah. Addicted to the NUrburgring, yeah? When you live here, there's no other chance. This is the mecca for motorsport. WOMAN: There's something here that pulls you back. MAN: There's no other track as long as this, or has as many corners, or has the elevation. When you come here, it's just a totally different place than you ever imagined. I just love it. Yeah, I love it down here. It's unique. NARRATOR: With three months left before his record attempts Guy's driven to Germany in his other transit van to reccie the Nordschleife. And he's arranged to meet up with the man whose lap record he intends to beat, Now then, Dale. - Ey up, stranger? What's happening, mate, you alright? - Yeah, alright. Alright, mate. Dale Lomas, I've known him from years ago. He got infected by the Nfirburgring bug. DALE: Can see Wehrseifen hairpin from the kitchen window. I've been riding and driving and instructing here cracking on for 20 years. I want to learn, I'm just gonna... cos you're the man that holds the record. Yeah, I'm just gonna... milk you for information. - Milk me for-- Yeah, yeah, get as much information out of you as I can. Just his course knowledge. Dale Lomas' course knowledge is bloody second to none. Every bump of the course. He reckons he's done 20-odd thousand laps round it. GUY: What's Project 8 then? What's that? I had the great pleasure to kind of say, "Oh, yeah, this is a four-door Jaguar. Please hop in." So, here we go. And he's like, "Is this fast then?" I'm like, "Oh, yeah." NARRATOR: The Jaguar Project 8 is the fastest overproduction four-door around the Nurburgring,. GUY: How fast are we going now? Nearly 160. Little jump, down to fifth, turn it in, back on the gas. Six hundred horsepower and all-wheel drive and we're flying down the hill, way over 100 miles an hour into the dip and I just get the moment to have a quick look and see how Guy's doing, and I could see his eyes widen slightly. HE LAUGHS - ENGINE ROARS GUY: It moves. She moves, she flies. A lot faster than what you would think, a lot faster than what it looks. You know what you're doing, don't you? I can see this. HE LAUGHS I should by now. If I was driving a forklift 20,000 times round the warehouse I'll be pretty deft at that as well, you know? GUY: You're flat out now. - DALE: Yeah, we're flat now. It's all there for using, I suppose, innit? - It's all there. Little jump there. Little jump in the middle of Stefan-Ballot. I see this as a calibration run, showing him how fast 600 horsepower is so that he's got an idea in his head what's gonna be expected of him when push comes to shove. GUY: That's a lot quicker than I thought. - DALE: Yeah. That's a lot quicker than I thought. I'm not getting round there 'owt like that. DALE: It's about being comfortable and having faith. DALE (V0): He's got a big personal challenge ahead of him. He's got a 13 mile international standard Grand Prix circuit to learn. They've never built a circuit like this again because nobody would, cos it's too much to learn and he's got to nail it, cos there's so much riding on it now. GUY: I've got a sweat on. - DALE LAUGHS Change everywhere... Yeah, that's been bloody brilliant, to be honest. Yeah. NARRATOR: Next, Dale and Guy set off on a slightly slower look around the track,. GUY: Yeah, we went on the bikes, and had a look round and about the track. DALE: I wanted to show him the technical trickiness of the track. DALE: Good view, innit? GUY: Yeah, what a place, hey? - DALE: It's mega. DALE: So this, Brfinnchen 2, is decreasing radius and the reason it's decreasing radius is you have to think back to the days when they started building this track. GUY: Go on. - DALE: 1925 to 1927. Back in the day they were just convincing people that maybe, possibly they could race vehicles in a controlled environment instead of round the town square on a Sunday morning. - GUY: Yeah, yeah, right. DALE: So, it was a big thing. But they decide it's gotta be tough, and it's gotta be tricky. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, so decreasing radius corners there's only one real trick to it, and the Nfirburgring's full of this late turn in, late apex. - Yeah. NARRATOR: The apex of a corner is usually Its geometric centre, When driving, hitting the apex allows you to take the straightest line and maintain the highest speed, A corner with a decreasing radius, which tightens the more you go around it like so many at the Nurburgring has the apex further around the bend,. So, to maintain the highest speed, you need to tum in a lot later. Remember, if you turn in too early and you hit that apex that you think is the apex in your mind... - You'll knacker the exit of the corner. The track's going that way, and you're going that way. Yeah. - That's the sub-optimal solution to the corner, isn't it? - Sub-optimal solution! Right, alright. NARRATOR: The Niirburgr/ng staged Its first car race on 19th of June, 1927. It was won by German driving legend Rudolf Caracciola in car number one, a Mercedes Benz Model S, Right from the start the Nordschleh'e was opened every evening for members of the public to drive it, What's now become known as a “touristenfahrten”. GUY: So, what's this then, mate? DALE: Welcome to BrUnnchen, AKA YouTube Corner. Perfect view of one, two, three corners... - GUY: Yeah. DALE: ...and everybody's got a smart phone. So, if you do make a mistake... - GUY LAUGHS and you make it here. - GUY: The world's gonna see it, yeah. DALE: It'll be up in front of the whole world within ten seconds of you doing it. This is a daily occurrence, obviously. Boys crashing every day, there's boys into the barrier every day? Track's open seven days a week, there's boys crashing seven days a week. That's just the way it is, isn't it? - Right, right. DALE: We're standing looking at one tiny section of the whole Nordschleife. - Yeah, yeah. And it's coming in over the right... - Yeah. DALE: Like 100 foot higher than this bit. - Yeah. DALE: And in the whole lap of the NUrburgring you're gonna go down 1000 feet to Breidscheid Bridge, you're gonna come up 1,000 feet in a couple of kilometres. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's gonna be hammering every kind of thermal aspect of the engine, gear box and diff. You've gotta build something that's proper, mate. GUY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. NARRATOR: In 1951, the Nflrburgring staged Its first Formula 1 Grand Prix. Drivers complained repeatedly that the track was too dangerous for Formula 1, And after winning the 1968 Grand Prix in driving rain and fog Jackie Stewart famously nicknamed it "The Green Hell“, DALE: This is not public access. - GUY: Right. DALE: This is special permission only, so... NARRATOR: Data's intimate track knowledge means he can take Guy to the exact point where this track's relationship with Formula 1 ended in 1976. DALE: Up there is Lauda Links. - GUY: Yeah, yeah. So, Lauda Links stands for everything deep and murky about the NUrburgring Nordschleife history. GUY: Go on. - DALE: 1976. Niki Lauda, he'd had reservations about the NUrburgring for a couple of years. - Mm-hm. DALE: Niki Lauda's also driving force of the F1 Driver Safety Council. GUY: OK. - The night before the race Niki's pushing hard that they should vote not to race. GUY: OK. - This place was hard to get ambulances and response crews to... - GUY: Yeah. Was difficult to marshal safely and was still ridiculously dangerous with no run-off, and massive potential for loss of life. And he lost. - Right. The teams put the pressure on the drivers to not give up. GUY: Yeah. - So, they raced. Like the man he was, Lauda took that result on the chin and raced his heart out the next day. - GUY: Yeah. DALE: So, he comes into here, round that left he went into the fence on the outside there just in front of us, and landed in a fiery heap just here. GUY: Right, OK. OK. DALE: And it's absolutely chilling stuff. Back then, the first guys that were on scene in a fire proof suit were... GUY: Yeah, the drivers. - The drivers. GUY: Bloody hell, right. How long was it before the fellow drivers got him out the car? DALE: Couple of minutes before they had him out properly. GUY: Oct... Massive facial burns, isn't it? - DALE: Massive facial burns. The end result was Nfirburgring never saw an F1 race again. GUY: Right, so that was the nail in the coffin then? - That was it. He proved his point by having this massive crash. Right, OK. - I'm pretty sure it's not the way Niki wanted to prove his point, but... - No, no. DALE: The point was made. GUY: Right, and Formula1 have never been back here since? DALE: Yeah. - OK. NARRATOR: Miraculously, Niki Lauda survived and was racing again before the end of the season, But the Nordschteife remains one of the most dangerous circuits on Earth, TYRES SCREECH - DRIVER: Oh! Jesus Christ! MAN: Better make sure he's alright. - DRIVER: Yeah. NARRATOR: To get his first hands-on experience of driving this perilous track Guy hooks up with another ring legend,. Right, um, got Andy Carlisle. Motorbike lap record holder at the NUrburgring and you're gonna give me a bit of advice, aren't you, mate? Oh, come on, you don't need much advice, do you? You've got more tin cups than I have. GUY LAUGHS NARRATOR: Together they head off for a couple of "touristsnfahrten" laps in Guy's other transit van,. ANDY: Look at the white sign, turn at the white sign and run the curbs. Run 'em, greedy, greedy. Greedier than that, that's a nibble. - Is that right? Yeah, that's a... I should be out the track. He looks at things in the same way as what Dale does but puts it over in a different way. ANDY: As a rule of thumb, all the sections have got summat in them. There's a risk, a jump, a bump... There's summat, right? - Yeah, yeah. So if you haven't found it, you're either not going fast enough or you haven't paid attention. - Yeah. ANDY: And as you go faster new stuff will come out the floor and find you. GUY: It's good just to hear a... another man's version of the same events. NARRATOR: To stand any chance of breaking the transit van speed record Guy will need to be carrying as much speed as possible out of the final corner before the two kilometre straight. Are we... are we apexing it or we're not apexing? - Yeah, we are. Super wide. Number... - Yeah, 186, don't commit into it until... And then it's number, and have a look for when the colour changes goes red, and somewhere in there, there'll be a strong throttle on point. Yeah. - And then work her backwards until it's... you've run out of grip. - Yeah. GUY: It's good that I can go back now, let all that information sink in. And we need to get to the point where the van is the limiting factor cos at the moment, I am the weak link in the chain. NARRATOR: With two months left before his record attempts the complete rebuild of his van is we" on schedule. Yeah, we're on top of it if not slightly ahead, but you know, you never think that. Got Shazza. Shazza, if she's not filming young 'un and the dogs she's on the case, yeah, my own personal camera operator. SHARON: The only reason I'm looking at this is because it has "Quaife" on it. So I know that that's the gearbox. I love it. It's just fannying about in your shed, innit? Making stuff in your shed, I love it. NARRATOR: Building a blistering/y fast van [5 only half the battle for Guy, if he stands any chance of success he'“ need to know every twist, turn and elevation change of the 129 mite Narburgring circuit by heart, That's a treat, hey? HE LAUGHS NARRATOR: So, he intends to spend half an hour every day driving and learning the track using a state of the art driving simulator rig. I mean, this is far better than playing it with a conventional controller cos if the steering wheel pushes back at you it does give you a fairly real sensation. GUY (V0): Y'know, and I'm not having to put petrol in it I'm not having to put tyres on it. It sort of teaches you not to be scared... cos you can be brave, you see? You don't hurt yourself. It don't cost you any... any damage. You know, cos it's not your car. NARRATOR: The lap record Guy wants to beat [5 nine minutes and 57 seconds. A big ask in a van but nowhere near the fastest lap of all time, GUY: A couple of weeks after we left the NUrburgring yeah, Porsche have been and set a new outright lap record just short of a minute off the existing lap record. What was that? Six...? 6.11. And the new record's 5.19, in the 919 Porsche which is a weapon of a thing. But if you watch that, I mean, you're gonna put it on the programme, aren't ya? Jeez, man, that is fast. If we could do a minute off, I would be... I... I'm just trying to say, what could I say that it's gonna be? I'd be... I could say I'd be tickled pink. NARRATOR: To further Improve his chances of smashing both speed records Guy's hired a room at a local Grimsby community centre for a special training session, We're on the Nunny. That's like the bloody roughest estate in Grimsby. I was born here on the, yeah, the maternity hospital. The Grimsby Maternity Hospital was on the Nunny. NARRATOR: He '5 meeting up here with Dr Sheryl/e Calder, I'm a sports scientist and performance coach and I work mainly with elite athletes all over the world. NARRATOR: Dr Sheryl/e works with many of the world's leading professional and Olympic athletes, and has flown in from South Africa specifically to work with Guy,. In very layman, simple terms, I work on how you take information in. So, eyes fit, how quickly your eyes see, take information in recognising, pick up cues. How do you know it's not fit? Have you trained it before? - Never. OK, then it's not fit. - Never heard of anything like this. Then it's not fit, so I'm gonna do one test, it's to see how quickly your eye moves from one spot to another. You need to move from that number to the top number, etc, etc till you get to the bottom. - OK. Get your eyes fit? You ready to go? - Yep. Go. - Two, one... GUY (V0): It's alright your eyes seeing, but your brain's gotta translate what your eyes see and then translate that into movement at your limbs. In this case, it's, um... pressing throttle, pressing brake, turning the steering wheel. Fifty-nine seconds, you did it in. - OK. He... he almost did it in double the time expected, so really slow. And you had seven mistakes. - Seven mistakes? No, I was crap, weren't I? I was crap. - But the exciting thing is we're gonna train that ability. We're gonna give you a training programme to do and we're gonna make you better. What we've discovered over time is you can train people to make more effective decisions under pressure. It's the ability to recognise something early which means you've got more time to make a decision. NARRATOR: By studying the Nflrburgring on videos and on a simulator Dr Sheryfle has designed a training programme for Guy, SHERYLLE: Visual cue... Orange mark, turning. - GUY: Yeah. So you really need to scan and make a quick decision. NARRATOR: It should help him make more effective decisions under pressure when he's making his record bids, Do you know this track, lass? How do you know all this? Because I've gone round it. Bloody hell. - Quite a few times. She has put some effort in. NARRATOR: Next, she gets Guy working and runs him through the bespoke exercises she wants him to use over the next three months. SHERYLLE: Find that object... - GUY: Yeah. And follow it. Every time it changes, you count. SHERYLLE: Got it? - No. SHERYLLE: Shall I restart it for you? - Yeah. Bloody hell, they're moving. Cos it was a bit of a challenge and I thought, "Oh, right, this isn't easy." Anything that's a bit of a challenge, I dig me heels in. "Oh, right, this isn't easy. This isn't easy, I like this." GUY: 19. - SHERYLLE: OK. Here we go, 24. Whoops! - OK. I missed a few then, yeah. - But tough, hey? Yeah. - Tough. Yeah, but we kept repeating it and I thought, "Oh yeah, I've got sort of... not great, but I did get better, now I've got the gist of it." Looks like 100 percent to me. - Yeah, 100 %. Seven out of seven, really cool. Well done. And then we identified his ability to stay focused is... is not good. If your concentration waivers you're not gonna be seeing-- - Which it is. What you should be seeing. That could be dangerous on that track. NARRATOR: Dr Sheryl/e's theory [5 that through training we can improve our ability to react to our environment meaning our eyes detect more detail and our brain processes how to react much, much faster. When you see someone throw you a ban your natural first reaction is to move your hand up to catch it. Then use your eyes to try and pinpoint its trajectory process that information and adjust the position of your hand to try and make the catch. Dr Sheryfle's training teaches you to change your order of reaction so when you initially see the baii thrown your eyes immediately pinpoint its trajectory and your brain processes that information faster, Then when your hand goes up for a catch, it is reacting to precise information and is much more likely to make a very clean catch. For Guy, when he's driving the Nflrburgring at massive speeds the ability to see, process and react much faster and more precisely to everything will be crucial to a quick time. GUY: I mean, me eyes, me brain and me limbs is all gonna work a bit more efficiently. And she says, yeah, that were the coordination from me tid welding. So I thought, "Oh, yeah, I need a bit of that." SHERYLLE: You need to respond to that basketball... Right, OK. - As soon as you see it on the screen. Go on. - There we go, a little bit quicker. NARRATOR: F1 driver, Va/tter/ Bottas has been using Dr Sheryfle's training programmes for a while. Yours was 0.64, Valtteri is 0.11. I always ask Valtteri, "How do we impact your performance?" And the one thing he did say is that... when he does eye gym, everything slows down for him. And I think in Formula 1, if you can slow things down it's... it's quite an advantage. Guy was fantastic, yeah, he embraced what we did. He was excited to do the training and we kind of had to get him off at the end and say, you know "You've done enough for the day." GUY: You can only have ten minutes a day now. I've got to the point where they'll only give you ten minutes to play a day so I've had all me ten minutes now. We've explained to him how to do it, and, um, he needs to get fit. And I do genuinely believe it will help me breaking this lap record. NARRATOR: Wit/7 two months left before Guy's double record attempt his van spends a couple of weeks at Pro Alloy near Cambridge having a bespoke cooling system fitted, When he gets it home, Guy's chuffed to bits with what they've done, GUY: Have a look at it, have a look at it. Can you see? You see that? How trick's that? NARRATOR: With a mountain of work still to do Guy's van is a tong way away from being ready to travel to Germany, It's taking shape, it is taking shape. The plan is... yeah. End of the month, sort of fire up end of the month. That'll be, yeah, that'll be good. That'll be good. NARRATOR: And Guy still has to prepare himself for driving the world's most demanding circuit. So, training continues on Dr Sheryue's eye gym, He puts in a lot more laps on his simulator and travels back to Germany to put in his first fast laps around the NUrburgring, GUY: Got here for about one or two o'clock, did five laps on the motorbikes. To do it on a bike was great because that's what I do. I didn't have to think about riding a motorbike at all because that's what I've done since I was a kid. Yeah, just, yeah, autopilot, just taking in the circuit. Yeah, riding the bike, I didn't have to think about that. Really enjoyed it. Had me heated grips on, had me heated seat on, it was mega. It was mega. Made me realise how I miss riding me motorbike, I bloody loved it. NARRATOR: Back in Lincolnshire and with just one month before his double record shot,” Oil pressure is the main number, innit? NARRATOR: Guy's finally ready to start up his van for the first time since the rebuild began, ENGINE STARTS ENGINE REVS - INDISTINCT CHATTER NARRATOR: Helped by his mate Jez, and 11-year-old nephew Louis Guy gets the van on his rolling road to test the engine, gearbox and new rear axle assembly at high revs, First time now, so... see what happens! JEZ: Go on, mate, yeah. Go, go. ENGINE WHIRS NARRATOR: It's sounding good. But the next test will be the crucial one when Guy takes his van back to the Cadwe" Park circuit for the first time in half a year,. I love a challenge, love a challenge. Yeah, but this is a big 'un, this is a big 'un. Yeah, getting the bloody van done. GUY: How's she looking, boss? NARRATOR: There are just 12 days left before Guy Martin attempts to set a new lap record for a van at the legendary Niirburgring in Germany,. And at the same time, set a new world speed record for a transit van along the Circuit's two kilometre straight, He spent six months rebuilding his favourite transit van ready for his double record shot,. He's moved the 35 litre twin turbo eco boost engine to make his van mid-engined,. He's fitted a Quaife racing gearbox complete with paddle shifters. He's upgraded the van's rear suspension and brakes fitted a state-of-the-art charge cooling system and ripped out everything that might added unwanted weight, Now, he's returned to the Cadwe" Park circuit to drive it in anger for the very first time, GUY: Done a bit of dyno time. Other than that, that's all it's done. Today, the first time the van's been driven in anger, really. Just to see what it's gonna do. That's me being optimistic... putting a tow hitch in the front in case we need towing! GUY LAUGHS NARRATOR: Guy's testing his van during an open track day. GUY: You just rock up, pay your money, show your car license go do your laps round the track. Bloody great. NARRATOR With less than two weeks left before his record attempts any major problems here could end the project before the van '5 even seen Germany. GUY (V0): Went out in the first stint to go and do three laps. R's gone mm 3 km of a monk and a with DOWN“ firefight. "What just fell? Is that a bit vibrating?" And I just shut off, and I come straight in. Came in, it had blew a CV boot off. NARRATOR: A CV boot protects a CV or "Constant Velocity Joint" which Is an intricate bail and socket joint connecting the drive shaft to the wheels atone end and the gearbox at the other,. Its job is to allow for the up-and-down motion of the suspension, The joints are filled with a special lubricating grease that is sealed tight within the rubber CV boots. We know what caused that, cos I was being too... I put too much grease. It's that near the silencer, that much heat in there the grease has boiled, giving the gas off, blown the boot off, so we've realised that. That one, that one, that one, then that one. DRILL WHIRS - Whoa! And then from then on, we've not had any bother, really, have we? NARRATOR: After fitting the new CV joint Guy heads back out on track,. But as he gets faster, it's clear the front brakes are struggling, GUY: It can get stopped, but it's blocking on, on the front. Them callipers, a bit on the salt. They had a right pasting when they was here the last time. GUY LAUGHS - So we'll sort that out. NARRATOR: The van's first run is judged to be a qualified success. None of us know what we're doing really. And we've just sort of come at it and it's... and it's all bloody worked! Great day. NARRATOR: But there's always more work to be done. Front brakes, painting, side skirts... paint the wheels... get some decent tyres for the rear. Whatever, that van's good enough to do the record. If that van can't do the record, I want sacking. I want sacking. NARRATOR: With the van nearing readiness Guy's decided he's still the weak link so he's back at the Nurburgring again this time to put in as many fast laps as he can to cement his track knowledge learned on the simulator. And it's a beautiful day for learning the ring. GUY: It's alright playing them computer games, but there's nothing... nothing like the real thing. Me socks, mate, they are clean. Yeah, Suzuki Swift. It's like a little go-kart. You can murder 'em and they don't give any grief. So it was great, it's great. Just gave you a load of time to learn without being overcome with horsepower and braking power and handling, it was just a great tool to do it in. Really just confirmed that I had done enough simulator. It just... yeah, I... I'd put enough effort in. Flight, once I come out of the Karussell, I know this follows that, follows this and I was confident enough, it was just the details that I didn't have. NARRATOR: For his last few laps Guy's joined again by ring veteran Andy Carlisle, Go. More! GUY: Know it like the back of their hand. Well, yeah. I don't know the back of me hand that well but yeah, knows the job inside out. Faster than it looks, just run it out really wide. ANDY: Go on, keep footing. GUY: Oh, all those little details. Right, head for this and that'll carry you over that bump at the right angle. Gas, hop. That hop's the risky bit. It's just best guess of how the transit's gonna behave. All the way wide. Don't hit that! You might roll the van. - GUY: I might what? Roll it. - BLEEP! Honestly. ANDY (V0): Just some ideas of where to be a little bit cautious where to expect the thing to have a lot of instability. GUY: What will I... what am I worried about in a van? Floating. ANDY (V0): There's always a problem with something that you find that you weren't quite expecting. Of course there is in an untested, unusual vehicle. What are we gonna find? Hmm... GUY: Brilliant, hey? Not a bad day at work. - What are you thinking? Petrol, get it revved. I'm paying for the petrol. Loved it. Mega, been bloody brilliant. But now, yeah, I've sort of been a bit on edge for the past month or so cos the amount of pressure on me with the van. I get a bit quiet, and I get me head down but I do love it, I love being under pressure. I love being under pressure. I love being under pressure. We'll go get some petrol. NARRATOR: It's now the day before Guy's attempt to become a double record breaker at the Nlirburgring. He won't be putting in any practice laps today because there's racing on track all day,. At the holiday home he's rented for the weekend Guy and his team of males use the time to thoroughly check every part of the van,. We're not scrimped on anything, we've not bodged anything. Everything is done to the best of our ability. Anything that goes wrong is because we couldn't have accounted for it. Everything up to this point has been accounted for. But it should be a peach. Job should be a peach. NARRATOR: But as they make final checks on the wheels and brakes they find a massive problem,. Come and have a look. Found a massive crack in the brake disc. We were just doing all the little things, there was nothing major to do just tweaking here and tweaking there. Just thought we'd take the wheel off, just have a look round and then we found these massive cracks in the front wheel. NARRATOR: All modern road vehicles use disc brakes. As you press the brake pedal, pads close around the brake discs and slow the speed at which the wheels can tum, Eventually the friction will stop the wheels turning altogether. Braking is all about energy transfer converting the massive kinetic energy of a fast-moving vehicle into heat energy through the friction between the pad and disc, The trick is then to dissipate that heat energy into the air and away from the vehicle as efficiently as possible, However, if the discs and pads are worked very hard constantty getting very hot then quickly cooling like those on Guy's van where they are repeatedly trying to slow a two-ton vehicle from racing speeds they can crack, GUY: If that flies to bits, it'd probably take the wheel out and probably chuck me into a barrier somewhere. Good job we found that. - LOUIS: Yeah. TOOL WHIRS LOUIS: On the last one as well! - That would've been a disaster. NARRATOR: If Guy's record attempts are to go ahead they need to find a replacement disc very quickly, And this was at three o'clock, Sunday afternoon in South Germany. Oh, what are we gonna do? NARRATOR: Guy asks his only two local contacts to help. Biker Andy Carlisle heads off with the cracked disc to try and find a match while Nflrburgring test driver Dale Lomas trawls his contacts. So then we had to play "hunt the brake disc" which turned out to be quite an exciting game. Dale made a few phone calls and we found some discs, there was no discs round here. DALE: My first solution basically involved asking friends and relatives to go to the brake warehouse pick up the discs which were in Wigan and drive them here. You alright, boss? - Alright? GUY: Go on, what are you thinking? Do you reckon he could get here for before ten in the morning? DALE: It's 12 hours door to door. Five o'clock-ish now, it should be theoretically here just in time for breakfast, cup of tea and throwing discs on the van. That was gonna be an issue. That was gonna be fitting brake discs at 7 o'clock in the morning for an 11 o'clock run. Which is not optimal. NARRATOR: Time will be tight In the morning so Guy gets on with prepping both front wheels for their new discs. TOOL WHIRS But then Andy Carlisle arrives back with a miracle, Took the old disc to somebody who's interested and likes braking and said, "Don't suppose...?" And he said, "Oh, I can't go in the shed at the minute. I'm gonna take me dog out." He's taken his dog out, anyway. A few hours later, he'd found... he'd found one pair. NARRATOR: They're a pair of custom made one-off discs for the rear of a Nissan GTR. DALE: The disc wasn't even in any catalogue. Not available online, nothing you could search for. It was purely something knocked up as a bit of an upgrade for a Nissan GTR. NARRATOR: And amazingly, they fit Guy's van. They wasn't perfect, but if anything, they was better than what we had. They was brand new, just a little bit bigger but we could account for that with a radial mount on the calliper. So that's what we did, that's what we did. GUY: On! Off! That won't happen again. That was a huge slice of luck. DALE: If you were to apply a figure to that Iuckiness I'd say that would be like a one or two percent chance that we fixed that problem within that time frame within ten kilometres of here. NARRATOR: Guy's record attempts are now back on track, And relax! Hopefully, everything will go well tomorrow. We'll do a couple of steady laps to start with break the record on those steady laps and then just go and smash the record. That's... and then we can drive home happy campers. But that's not gonna happen. Summat is gonna go wrong, course it is! I know that, course it is. NARRATOR: It's mid-October In Germany. Usually at this time of year, the Eifel mountains have seen their first snowfall of the winter. But today, the forecasters are predicting a mini heat-wave, And that's perfect for Guy Martin, who has come here to try and break two records,,, the van lap record around the legendary Nflrburgring and on the track's two kitometre straight, he wants to reach 177 miles per hour and set a new world speed record for a transit. I'm nervous, I'm nervous. Need to get me torch and me overalls and have a look round the back. NARRATOR: The lap record he wants to beat was set five years ago by ring aficionado Date Lomas in a modified Volkswagen T5. INAUDIBLE CHATTER NARRATOR: Dale's come along to watch Guy try to snatch his record driving the hugely challenging 12.9-mile circuit in under nine minutes and 57 seconds. This is perfect lap record weather. This is what you want. Because you've got the sun beating down, warming up the tarmac you've got the cold air still lying over the land to feed the turbos the cold, dense air. Couldn't have asked for a better day. What's it doing back home? It's lashing it down back home. We're in, what is this? The second week? Start of the third week of October. Driving here, was 28 degrees. Beautiful, beautiful. Right! NARRATOR: Guy has just one hour in which to set both records. The Circuit's his between 11:30 and 12:30 and he'll go for the lap record first, GUY: I'm gonna do two steady laps to start with. Hopefully do the record in those two steady laps. Come in, refuel, check the tyre pressures, go again and hopefully smash the record. NARRATOR: If all goes well, he 'll then head out again to also try and break the transit van world speed record. That's the plan. But it's not gonna go to plan, is it? Course it's not gonna go to plan, we all know that. NARRATOR: With just ten minutes left before his slot Guy changes into his racing overalls and the correct footwear for driving a transit. GUY: Got me work boots on. Just thinking... I was thinking about race boots and all that. Transit, innit? Yeah, get your work boots on. ENGINE STARTS It's fingers crossed, fingers crossed the van's alright. Fingers crossed that I don't do anything stupid which... that's not out of the question, is it? That has happened before, hasn't it? NARRATOR: Also wearing his racing suit is Andy Carlisle the fastest man around the ring on a motorcycle. Guy wants Andy in the van during his record attempts. Co-driver. Rally drivers have it, don't they? Rally drivers have. What's... HE LAUGHS That's not against the rules, is it, to have a co-driver? If it meant I was gonna go faster, then why not? ANDY: There's an awful lot of untested things to do with such an unusual vehicle. So, if there's something that's gonna feel like a risk I can maybe remove a bit of speed before that risk goes to critical. From what we lost in Andy's weight, we would more than gain in his track knowledge that he could relay to me. GUY: Alright? - ANDY: Yes. NARRATOR: On the dot of 11:30, Guy and Andy set off, A little bit apprehensive. NARRATOR: Because Guy has exclusive use of the track he has been given special permission to head out of the pits the wrong way to then turn around and give himself a good run-up for the start without having to drive a whole 12.9 mile out lap, First job, break a lap record,. ANDY: Right then, lad, we're away. Gas and go. Lead a bit in, we've gotta go into shade. LOOK at the Mn board cm the be“, 2m board. I can't hear you. Right, that's our maximum. Can you hear me now? Yes. - Good. ANDY: Calm it, calm it. Jump straight, then gentle brakes. Jump straight, gentle. Test the curve, see what it... see what it behaves like. No, it bounces. Skimmer brakes, feel it hop. NARRATOR: Halfway through his very first lap Guy's flying, but the van's a handful, GUY: It's just a big van, it's too tall. Trying to manhandle that with no power steering but it's good cos I got loads of feeling through the steering. ANDY: Strong right straight through, bit more gas, keep her balanced. It's a lot of van. Yeah, and the brakes, struggling with the brakes. Is that locking the back? Too much power in the rear brakes compared to the front brakes. ANDY: It seems to handle alright. Bit bouncy through Wippermann. NARRATOR: As he powers along the 2m straight for the first time, Guy hits 144 miles per hour and that's without pushing hard,. ANDY: Look at that black sign. Keep back on the gas, keep your feet back on it, bit more. NARRATOR: As he nears the end of his first lap an is looking good,. You was all sort of on pit lane, weren't ya? What'd it look like when I came on? Alright? Motoring? NARRATOR: Amazingly, on his very first attempt Guy has beaten the lap record by almost 30 seconds recording a time of 9,28, Gas through, feel it jump. Gas. NARRATOR: He's not finished yet though, And pushes even harder on lap two,. Everything was hunky dory really. ANDY: We're going to be travelling faster than we have before. Is it all gonna work? Second lap, we was going faster. But the van was getting bloody hard work. ANDY: Just get it stopped here. ANDY: And brakes. - GUY: Yeah, I know. Everything was red hot in the engine bay, all the rear suspension, the front suspension was just... got two ton of van to deal with. It was just getting red hot. And it was just pushing on cos the tyres were overheating. Oh, yeah. You'll have enough cameras in the van to see that I might've been sweating. NARRATOR: A third of the way into the lap Guy's six seconds up on his previous time, I think what I was losing in the van being unsettled I was gaining in confidence in the track, and that van around that track. NARRATOR: As he rides the banked Karusse/I corner he's 10 seconds faster, and on for a blistering lap. ANDY: Use all the track on the way out. Every inch. Just from the noise alone, everything resonates. Gas up and over, feel it, it wriggles. It's one of the loudest, if not the loudest, vehicles I've been in. Gentle brakes before. Missed the first apex, look for the second. ANDY: There's something about that van that is... it's playing with fire. It's really playing with fire. NARRATOR: Guy and Andy are still on track for a great time, But behind them, Andy's words are proving a" too prescient, A turbo oil line has come loose and oil is now spraying onto the engine and that's started a fire. We braked and saw the smoke come forward and I thought, "Oh, that maybe ain't right." There's smoke coming through into cabin. Yeah. ANDY: Reading the apex, what are the temperatures like? Good. - Right. GUY: Everything was alright, we're looking at the numbers on the dash. So I thought there's no issue there, but we have... there is something going on in the back, but the van was still going good. Keep going, it's not completely on fire yet. ANDY: Faster than it looks, you can let it run out really wide. Feed a touch more gas in. More, bit more, more again. NARRATOR: As they reach the 2m straight the fire's getting worse, This could be Guy's only chance to push for the speed record. GUY NO): And then she conked out. Don't know why, I don't know why it did that. So I had to reset everything, switch everything back on. Ooh, she fired up again. So we lost a good few seconds there, and then we finished the lap. MAN SHOUTS: There's flames at the back of the car! ANDY (V0): As we're coming to a halt loosen belts to get the fire extinguisher out. MAN: Fire, fire. INDISTINCT CHATTER GUY: I thought there'd have been a bit of smouldering going on but no, I didn't think... I didn't think we'd have flames. But we did, and we dealt with them. No one died. WOMAN: You alright? - GUY COUGHS: Yeah. Did we do it? MAN: Do you wanna know your time? GUY: Go on, what we done? - MAN: 9.28. Oh, so we've done the record. - You've done the record. First lap, 9.28. - GUY: We've done the record. NARRATOR: Guy's broken the lap record but with the van's engine now fire-damaged he's forced to abandon the speed record attempt, Ey up! Call that a draw. NARRATOR: While the speed record will have to wait for another day,” GUY: Done the lap record over 30 seconds. MAN: 30 seconds? - GUY: Yeah. NARRATOR: Guy's more than happy, Happy camper. Happy camper. The job's done, the job's done. We had a fire. We had a fire, man. Me dad got his thumb up. ANDY: Surely everyone knows that if you're gonna go to a racetrack you don't take a van. No matter how much modifications and silliness you've thrown at it. We was nearly in an heat, weren't we? HE LAUGHS DALE: It's been mega fun. There is a certain grudging admiration from the Germans at what Guy's built in his shed and brought over and broke a record in. GUY: Any spare second I've had in my life over the past five months has been that {fanny van. And now... HE SIGHS And breathe! ANDY: It's not speed. Outright speed is stimulating but that doesn't mean that the very fastest vehicle is the most fun. That thing is such good fun. GUY: Dale's full lap record was 9 minutes, 57 seconds. I did on me first lap, 9 minutes 28. So the thick end of 30 seconds off. DALE: 9.28, mega lap time for a van. No van has ever gone that fast before. Yeah, but for how long am I gonna be NUrburgring lap record holder? Dale's got a smile on his face, yeah. You're not having my van. You're not having my van, boy.
