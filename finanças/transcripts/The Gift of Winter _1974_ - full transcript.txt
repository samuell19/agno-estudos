- [Voiceover] This is winter time. Beautiful, isn't it? - [Children] Yeah. - [Voiceover] Many people think that winter is the most beautiful time of year. - [Children] Yeah, I love it. - [Voiceover] Some say it looks like a fairy land and what terrific fun you can have in winter, skiing and tobogganing, making a snowman, making angels. Did you ever catch snowflakes on your tongue? Snow. Long long ago, the world didn't have any snow. No snow. (voices sadly pondering no snow) People were very unhappy in the winter time. There was no such thing as skimming fast down a hill on a toboggan. Nobody knew what a snowman was. No one had ever seen a snowball. You'd look stupid if you tried to catch a snowflake on your tongue. No one had ever heard of snowflakes. Winter was a time of wind, darkness, and cold, but no snow. - I hate winter, bleh! - I just wish that nasty old winter would just go away forever and ever. Go south or something. - Golly, we can't even have any fun outside. - It's just cold and dreary and bleak and desolate. - That's right kid. What are you gonna do about it? - Nothin, that's what. What do kids know about winter anyhow? - Oh but I think that winter gets us all down, don't you? - That ain't half of it sister. - It's rotten, rotten, rotten. (people all complaining) (throat clearing) - Uh excuse me. Now it's all very well to complain about how depressing winter is, but talk will get us nowhere. What we need is action. We must organize, get together, rally our energies to overcome the problems that life presents. In other words, - [Woman] That's a good idea. - what are we going to do about it? Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Goodly. - Hi everybody, I'm Nicely. - Well I'm Malicious. - I'm Rotten. - I'm Small. - And I'm Tender. - I'm Bazooey, yabba dabba doobee. - Okay Goodly, that's a lot of fancy talk. What do you mean what are we gonna do about it? Winter is winter. It always has been. - I uh, I just thought we might all get together and do something relevant and uh constructive. - Yeah, maybe we could go see Winter personally and punch him in the mouth. (laughter) - Yeah and maybe we could get summer back as a Christmas present, ah ha ha ha. (laughter) - Gee, really seriously everybody, couldn't we all get together and see Winter personally? - Excellent, splendid. We'll go to the ministry of winter and lodge a formal complaint. - Hey why not? (people muttering agreement) - We'll have a protest march. Hey there'll be thousands of us. The voice of the people shall be heard. Yowee babba dooba daba dee. (cheering) - Hold it, hold it. We'll never get back in time for Christmas. (crowd grumbling) - No wait, wait, listen my friends, listen. I know that it is a long and difficult journey, but this is a great mission which will give us the strength to overcome whatever hazards we meet. Why I wouldn't think of being away from home for Christmas. We will proceed together. All of us united in our resolve that winter must never be the same again. I aim to set out for the ministry of winter now. Along with any who dare to come along. And for those of you who stay behind, I'll see you Christmas Eve. (cheers of encouragement) - Oh boy, yay, let's go. - Hey, this is no picnic we're talkin' about, you know? We ain't gonna nursemaid any kids along the way, see? So forget it. - Yeah who needs a couple of rotten kids along? - We'll be very good. - Really Small and Tender, I think it's much too long and difficult a journey for little girls and boys. - Right Small and Tender. You stay home with your mom and dad. We'll see you at Christmas. Meanwhile everybody prepare for departure. (sounds of agreement) - Change winter, fat chance. - I don't know Malicious, a little dynamite in the ministry of winter might be rather effective. - A little dynamite? I don't like that. How about a lot of dynamite? - Yowee, ready to go. We'll bring back summertime, sunshine, and flowers. Everybody, down with winter, yipee yipee. (chanting and cheering) Tromp, tromp, tromp, tromp - Step, step, stepity, step - Tromp, tromp, tromp, tromp - Steppity steppity, step step step - Tromp, tromp, tromp, tromp - Step, step, step, step, step Tromp, tromp, tromp, tromp - Tramp, tramp, tramp tramp - Are we gonna get there soon? - I don't know. - Step, step, steppity, step - Tramp, tramp,tramp - Steppity, step, step, step Step, step, steppity step, step, step - Trudge, trudge, trudge, trudge, trudge, trudge - Golly Tender, I think we should not have taken this shortcut through the woods. - But Small, we have to catch up somehow. We haven't seen anybody. - Maybe we better go home. - Small, I think we're lost. Help! - Don't worry Tender, I'll take care of you. Help! - What on Earth is going on here? - Tender, your voice sounds funny. - But I didn't say anything. - Oh who is this out here in the woods at this time of night? - I'm Small. - And I'm Tender. And we're lost. - And we're lost. - Spruce, Spruce, wake up Spruce. (snoring) Come on Spruce, wake up. We've got a couple of lost kids here. - Huh, hmmm, oh that's nice Maple, that's nice. (snoring) - Hey keep it down out there. - [Maple] Oh come on Spruce. - Shut up. - Spruce, you wake up right now. I'm talking to you. This is important. We have an emergency here for goodness sake and all you can do is (grumbling) - Quiet. - Okay, okay, listen a minute, eh? We've got two lost little kids here. (sounds of concern) - We're going on a protest march to the ministry of winter. - To fudge a limber timber. - To lodge a formal complaint about the dreary, bleak, cold, and desolate conditions that winter brings, and to - and to ask for it to be not winter at all, especially Christmas. (cheering) - Oh it's too late to go anywhere. Maybe they should just wait til morning. - Yes, that's it. Tell you what, Small and Tender, you camp here in the shelter of our branches, and we'll show you the way in the morning. - Oh you're a sugar Maple. - [Tender] Good night Small. - [Small] Good night. - [Trees] Good night. - Wake up Spruce, they're practically leaving. Now we know the way to the ministry of winter. Just listen to the trees, we'll show you the way. - This way, this way, this way, this way. - Alright everybody, ready to go again? - Yabba dabba doo, let's go. (grumbling and complaining) - My goodness Goodly, half the people have turned back. - Onward Nicely, onward. - This way, this way, this way. - What's for breakfast? - Here, have a peanut butter sandwich. - Oh boy. - Trudge, trudge - This way, this way, this way - I tell you, we should have taken the shortcut through the woods. - Are you kidding? We could get lost in there. - What's for lunch? - Here, try a peanut butter sandwich. - Wow. - Climb, climb, climb, climb - Thank you trees, goodbye. - Thank you trees, goodbye. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - [Trees] Merry Christmas, merry Christmas. - Step, steppity, step, steppity - Want a peanut butter sandwich? - Oh no thanks. - Step, step, steppity, step, step Look. - Well friends, we are the only ones left. Everyone else has turned back. Let's see who's here. Well there's Nicely and Malicious and Rotten and Small and Tender and Bazooey, and of course me, Goodly. - Small and Tender? - We can't have a couple of rotten brats tagging along. - Look at, this is no babysitting service. - Oh, but they've come so far all by themselves. - Now Nicely, we have enough to worry about on this long and difficult journey without the responsibility of two children. - Right, they got here by themselves, they can get back by themselves. - Fret not my wee muffins. Come come my little prunes. You just stick with me and I'll make sure no harm befalls you. - Oh Goodly, say they can come. - [Small and Tender] Good night. - [Nicely] Good night. - [Goodly] Good night. - [Malicious] Good night. - [Rotten] Good night. - [Small] Bazooey, I have to go to the bathroom. - Tromp, tromp, tromp (squealing) - What's that Bazooey? - Tramp, tramp, tramp - Up we go. - Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp - Boy we'll never even get to the ministry of winter by Christmas, nevermind home for Christmas. - Poor baby, you getting a dolly for Christmas or something? - It's a longer journey than we expected, isn't it Goodly? - Oh not really, Nicely. Besides it's very interesting countryside. - We won't be home for Christmas, will we Goodly? - Not too far to go now Nicely. We must press on and accomplish our mission. The people are depending on us. - Hmmm - Whoopee, wow. - What a way to spend Christmas, everybody, tramping up a rotten mountain in the freezing cold. Merry Christmas. - Ah go on Rotten, good for your character development. And no one needs it more than you do. - Trudge, trudge, trudge - Anybody care for a peanut butter sandwich? - No thanks - No - It's Christmas Eve, it's Christmas Eve. How irresponsible of me to promise that we'd all be home for Christmas. Why, if it were not for me, we might all be warm and safe at home instead of out here in this desolate wilderness. It's all my fault. - Oh, oh you mustn't blame yourself, Goodley. Why it was your clearheaded leadership that brought us this far, and I know in my heart that if we keep going, we'll succeed. - Do you really think so Nicely? - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - They make me sick. - Lookey, the ministry of winter. - [Voiceover] Creak, slam. - Boy what a rotten place to spend Christmas. (throat clearing) - [Information] May I help you? - [Goodly] We are here to see Winter. - Do you have an appointment? - [Goodly] No, we don't sir, miss, uh - No you can't come in without an appointment. - [Nicely] Oh please, we didn't know we had to have an appointment. - I'm sorry, you must have an appointment. That's regulations. - Well, we would like to make an appointment, then, to see Winter. - To see Winter? Well you can't do that. Winter doesn't see people. - If Winter doesn't see people, then what good would it do to have an appointment? - Right? Yeah, well you have to speak to the secretary of cold and fill out your application forms. Now go straight down the tunnel and turn to the right, cross over to the stairs, and then up one flight. Keep on going past the file department door, then take the elevator to the fifteenth floor. Go right, then left, then straight down the hall. You'll see the secretary's sign a-hanging on the wall. Get that? - I got it. Now we go straight down the tunnel and go up one flight til we come to the stairs, then we all turn right. I don't know, wait. - You have the mentality of a budgie bird. It's down the hall to the file department door, then take the stairs to the fifteenth floor, then you go around... - Boy, talk about dumb. - Down the hall... - You take the left elevator down the right hall til we see the secretary hangin' on the wall, uh no. - This way. - This way. - This way. - [Voiceover] Creak - February 4th, temperature to decrease 20 degrees as of and including the first week of January. (throat clearing) - Are you the secretary of cold? - Good heavens, what are you doing in here? Can't you see how busy I am? - We want to see Winter. And we were told to come to you. - See Winter? Not today you won't. This is Christmas Eve, you know. Winter is far too busy directing the wind and weather to see anybody, even me. Now I have work to do. - But we're supposed to fill out our forms. - Forms? Forms? You want to fill out forms? Well why didn't you say so? There's 44A and there's TGB, heidy ho, twiddle dee dee, forms forms, neatly piled forms, forms correctly filed, forms, forms, paper and card, by the inch and by the yard. - Huh, now? Do you mind? - Yes, yes, now it will be one for you and one for me and two for her and three for me, and some for him, and lots for me. Fill out every space you see. from one to 193. - Name of father and mother. - Mommy and Daddy? - That's right, a record-breaking cold period right into the second week of April. - Have you ever been a member of the military services? Well I was a Boy Scout for five years. - Yes, yes, that's right. Freeze everything solid. Sure, 10 to 20 below. - Age? Age? Old enough to know my way around Buster. - Well isn't that wonderful? Now you're Nicely? - No, I'm Goodly. - Ah yes, then you're Nicely? - Me, I'm Rotten. - I'm Small. - I'm confused. - Hello Confused, I'm Bazooey. - I'm confused. - I'm fed up. - Well who's Malicious? - She's Malicious. - [Cold] Are you sure? - No, I'm Tender. - I'm, I'm, ooh, oh, no, no, I mean, ooh. Wait here until these forms are processed. Slam. - [Goodly] Bazooey, get away from there. - [Small] Bazooey, you're not supposed to touch stuff that isn't yours. [Tender] What you doing Bazooey? Can I see? - [Rotten] Bazooey, no you idiot. (buzzer) - [Winter] What do you want now? (gasping) - There are some people here who have a com... There are some people here who have come a great distance to see you and they have a complaint. They want to... - [Winter] Complaint? Complaint? Send them in here immediately. - I'll go. - Goodly, you can't go in there alone. - No Nicely, this is something I've got to do. This is a job for a man. - Oh come on. - [Voiceover] Creak. - Rotten, the dynamite. - Right here. Let's go. - [Voiceover] Slam. - [Bazooey] Hey. Follow me. - [Winter] Now what's this I hear about a complaint? Speak up, you're wasting my time. Well? - Uh, I uh, uh - We have come on behalf of the people of our world to protest the dreary, bleak, cold, and desolate conditions brought about by the annual arrival of the season of winter. - Yay, right on. We the people, are forced to endure hardships which surely are unnecessary in duration and intensity. There remains not a single factor during the whole long, dark, depressing period that offers any human comfort or enjoyment whatsoever. - We hereby request that proper and effective procedures be initiated to, to, to make winter nicer. - [Winter] Well, I never. How dare you challenge the authority of Winter. My actions are under absolute legislation in accordance with the laws governing the sun, the planets, and the infinite order of the universe. There is no power on Earth that can change that. - But can you... - [Winter] No. - Come on. - [Goodly] I mean, can you, can, is... - No. - [Nicely] But could you please... - That will be all. - We can't just give up Nicely. - You're right Goodly. There's got to be a way to change winter. - [Voiceover] Slam - Change? Change? The very idea. If we had change, things would be different. Then where would we be, hmmm? - [Bazooey] Boy, this is the worst place I've ever been in in my life. - [Tender] Yeah, that's hard. - [Bazooey] It's the dreariest, bleakest, creepiest place I've ever been in. - Okay, let's go. - [Goodly] Where are Bazooey and the children? - [Rotten] Bazooey and the kids. - [Malicious] They're still in there. - [Rotten] They'll be blown up. - Gosh, that old Winter must be really mean to make things so awful. - Well maybe he can't help it. - [Small] Well why would he want to be mean, Bazooey? - [Bazooey] Well, maybe he's unhappy. Maybe he's lonely. That kind of thing hurts, you know, and sometimes causes meanness. - It won't budge. - You mean he doesn't have any friends? - Well gosh, nobody likes Winter. - Yeah, I mean how would you feel if nobody liked you? - Wow, even Mommy and Daddy? Gee Bazooey, does Winter have a mommy and daddy? - Wow, zapadoozey, what's this? (yelling) - What are you people doing? Look at this mess. What's going on here? What happened? What happened? - Huh? - Do you know what this stuff is? - Uh no. - What did he say? - His answer is no. - The answer is snow? - Snow is beautiful. Snow, beautiful snow. Beautiful snow, beautiful snow. (laughter) Oh snow, snow (laughter) Snow, snow, snow, ha ha ha. (laughter) (cheers and exclamations of joy) - Oh it's good to laugh. It's good to cry. It makes me feel so free. (laughter) Oh it's good to laugh. It's good to cry. It's ever so good to be me. (sounds of happiness) - Hey Small, let's take some snow home to Mommy and Daddy for Christmas. Hey, it is Christmas. - I'm sorry Small and Tender. - [Winter] Oh come, come, no need for sorrow. I'll get you home for Christmas. Let's go. (laughter) Oh it's good to laugh. It's good to cry. It makes me feel so free. It's good to laugh. It's good to cry. It's ever so good to be me. - It's good to insist. - It's good to persist. - It's good to be strong. - Or admit that you're wrong. - [All] It's ever so good to be me. - It's good to have guts - Or be kind of nuts. - It's good to be doggy - And a little bit naughty. - [All] It's ever so good to be, ever so good to be, ever so good to be me. - It's good to be little. - It's good to be big. - I'm wonderfully brittle. - I'm frightfully twig. - [All] It's ever so good to be, ever so good to be, ever so good to be me. It's good to laugh and it's good to cry. It makes me feel so free. (chant continues) (cheering) - What's this fantastic white stuff? (laughter) - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
