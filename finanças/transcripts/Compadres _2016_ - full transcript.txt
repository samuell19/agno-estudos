Oh, my God! She's your goddaughter! Don't give her bullets. I was just trying to entertain her. That was some night you put us through. That's why I don't have kids. You need a girlfriend. What do I need one for if I have you? Yeah, right. You wish. Come on, help me. - So where's my lazy friend? - He's getting ready. I'll get him to hurry up. Give me a hand. I'm being serious. - You need to settle down. - No, that's not for me. When you find the right woman, you'll see, it'll change your life. Do you think so? Why are you shaving? Come on, let's go. Are you sure he's going to be there? I'm talking to you. There he is, wake up. That son of a bitch Santos! Why don't we wait for backup? What backup? Come on. - Listen, Garza. - Hey. Do you have a plan? What do you think? Look at you, tough guys. Aren't you ashamed to drive a chick car? - What's it to you? - No, it's nice. Stay right where you are. Wouldn't this be great for your wife? - Yes. - Listen, you bastard. Seriously, how much? I'll buy it. I want to make it up to my friend's wife. Make it up to her for what? A night of passion. It happens, right? Passion? What the hell are you talking about? We were drunk. Well, at least she was. Are you talking about my wife? Go and fight somewhere else. Hey. To tell you the truth, she really loves you, my friend. All night, she kept screaming your name. You were joking, right? About my wife. You know me better than that! We're family, aren't we? Be careful. $10 million. Imagine how furious that asshole Gaspar will be! He asked for it. He shouldn't have told me to go to hell. Take the Tecate tunnel, they'll be waiting for you. Go, take the money to the gringo. Don't shoot. I have a daughter. She's almost one. Don't worry about her. She won't remember you. Freeze! You bastard! The party's over, asshole! It's not too late, I can solve all your problems. Don't be stupid. You're under arrest. - I can pay you. - I don't want your money. Garza, don't shoot! You're a police officer. - He had a daughter. - Don't be stupid! Your partner understood the risk in this. He knew he could be shot at any moment. But he had a family. That changes everything, right? It was your decision to move in. You didn't wait for me. You need to learn to trust others. You can't smoke here. Maria, have you met Lieutenant Garza? Nice to meet you. Here, this one's on the house. Maybe this'll cheer you up. I have to go. I'm really sorry. - Don't stay out too late. - No. Three months later What are you doing back here? - Shouldn't you be in school? - Don't you have to work? Damn brat. Give me a cigarette. Don't your parents give you an allowance? The world is screwed up because of people like you. You're just a lazy bunch of degenerates. Sweetheart, what are you doing? I'm just taking out the garbage. Shit! Maybe you can reach it, give me a hand. Give me a cigarette. Damn it! Jesus Christ! No, wait, don't! - You deserve it. - No, the whole pack. I saved your butt. Don't smoke them all at once, all right? I hate cigarettes. I need them to buy protection at school. Crazy kid! Who were you talking to? The future president of Mexico. You were smoking. Do you realize I know almost nothing about you? What do you want to know? I don't know... What were you like as a child? Why did you come up north? How many boyfriends you had? Is this an interrogation, officer? I'm with you now. And I adore you. Your lunch. Don't forget your lunch. You know everything about me and I-- If you ever smoke again, this will be the last time I'll ever kiss you. - What's up with you? - Nothing. What? I think someone's in love, am I right? Well, yes. I'll be right back. I need to get my wife's dress. Eat your lunch. Oh, this damn door! Jesus Christ! REST ASSURED YOU'LL ENJOY YOUR CHILDSP sign Maria? Can I come in? - Hey, pleased to meet you, Lieutenant. - Nice to meet you. My men at Quantico speak highly of you. And the FBI is grateful for your help, really, truly. In memory of my friend, can I kick this guy's ass? As long as you don't leave any marks on his face. You know how uptight these Americans are. You got it. What's going on, Garcita? I was expecting your girlfriend for conjugal visits. I'll take care of that for you. Remove the handcuffs. I don't like to hit anyone with their hands tied. Listen very closely. If you want your girlfriend back... Hello? Hello? ...do exactly as I say. Get out! Stay back. Idiot! Run! Get him! Damn it! Open the door! Wait here! Go! Go! Go! - Get out! - They forced me. Are you the Clown? How did you guess? Give me your gun. Give it to me or I'll shoot this guy in the head. Here. It wasn't loaded. But this one is. No hard feelings, Clown. Tell him to let her go. - Are you all right? - Yes. I'll always take care of you and our baby. Yes. Just like your friend took care of his wife and son? Or was it a daughter? Goodbye, Garcita. Santos! You're such a softie. So careful not to harm the babies. Maria. - What happened? - Feel this. Can you feel it? Can you feel it moving? At last you wake up! You had me worried. Where is Maria? We don't have any information. They took her hostage to get out of the hospital. I'm going to find her. Lieutenant Garza. Coronado. I'm relieving you of your duties. You're accused of participating in organized crime and treason against the armed forces. The D.A. is asking for 15 years. You have no idea how sorry I am. Have a nice day. What do you know about Santos? Nothing, there are no leads. Help me get out of here. I just want to find Santos. Maria is alive. I'm sure they released her as soon as they got out of the hospital. I'll be back tomorrow. The gringo showed me photos of the guy moving Santos' money. And I can find him. See the one here on the left? That's Krishna. He's a hacker specializing in money laundering. He has an associate known as "The Accountant," but we don't have much on him. We think Santos hired him. Do you recognize any of these men who's ever worked with or been connected to Santos? No. - Are you certain? - Yes. I'm sorry I cannot help you. If I intercept Santos' money... ...he's going to come after me. Help me. I ran all of the tests, and everything's fine. He can go back to prison tomorrow. - Thank you. If you'll excuse me. - Of course. I brought you Maria's cell phone. We found it at the hospital. What's your name? Roberto. Untie my hand. I can't. Haven't you ever had itchy balls? Every morning, Lieutenant. Imagine how I feel. This is like Chinese torture. - Maybe you can scratch them for me? - Oh, come on. Then just tie my foot. Come on, it won't take long. - Go ahead and scratch them. - Thank you. The guards outside leave leave at 9:00 pm. You should have scratched them for me. - A d-deal... - A deal's a deal. My friend trusted you. He gave you the money, as agreed, but you didn't sign the contract. This bar is my friend's now. Porky's Bar. Hold on, Porky. - Hello, Guasa. - Gaspar. It's your birthday! I brought you a present. Th-th-thank you, Gaspar. You can't resolve anything by beating people. I think this man understands now, right? You can go. - I left a generous tip. - Thank you. I'll see you later. - Garza? - No, it's your fucking mother. You bastard, you're hurting me! Just relax! Maybe he wanted to sign the contract, but you didn't give him enough time. Isn't that right? Isn't that right? Yes. Yes. You see? Give me the contract. Sorry, it's upside down. Can you sign it? He didn't mean to trick you, he just didn't think. Just like Santos. When he stole my money, I'm sure he hadn't thought it through. Tell me everything you know about the people who launder Santos' money. No. No? Yes... Everybody deserves a second chance. We're family. We have to trust each other. Until one of us breaks that trust. Have you brought many people through here? Mexico/USA Border Sure, hundreds. This is uncomfortable. How long till we get there? Stop complaining. Seats don't talk. Passport, please. I like you two so much, I'm going to give you both a trip to L.A. You're going to get those $10 million Santos stole from me. A guy by the name of Krishna has the money. Let's drink to that! Congratulations, Porky! Here's to Porky's Bar. We gotta move fast. Santos knows we stole the money. We have to transfer it now. We-- we-- we don't wanna mess with the Mexican mafia. These people will cut your head off! Wait, look. I'm not gonna work for a fucking Mexican the rest of my life. What took you so long? It's daylight already. We can't take any risks. Those gringo bastards use satellites. Oh my God! I was dying. Stop acting like such a crybaby. Be a man. - Waldo! - I'm peeing. My hands are numb, help me. I got a-- I got a nagging feeling that we're fucking this up. Don't be a pussy! Do you have the token? Yeah. Nice. Let's do it. Who's there? - Who's there? - Hey, buddy. There's a bad guy outside looking for you. Mike, I'm busy, man, I... - I am the bad guy. - Oh, shit... And let me introduce you my evil partner, Porky. You're sc-screwed now, asshole. Come on, guys, I'm... Please... No, no, no, no, no! Please! Please, don't! Don't b-bite me! - What's this? - What did you expect? If they take my gun, you're going to be in trouble. - There's no clip. - Oh, right. I'll owe you one. - Here you go. - Chili con carne? - What? You don't want it? - No, it's fine. If I wasn't so hungry... I'll see you later. - I owe you one. - You owe me many. Your boss, Santos, stole $10 million from my boss, Gaspar. Yes. And we want them back. The Accountant took the money, I don't have it. You both stole it. And the Accountant isn't here, isn't it? - Mmm-mmm. No. - So... I can cut your ears off. No, no, no, please, please, don't! Please, don't! Stop. Please, no. Please, no. Please, don't. Please, don't. Guasa, let-let me bu-bu-burn his foot. And th-then, you can do his ears. If he doesn't talk after two fingers and an ear, he's all yours. I'll burn him quickly. I'm fast, just like Montezuma. Why don't we flip for it? How do you say? - Coin. - Coin. - Anything, huero? - Coins? - Any coins? Any coins? - In the drawer, over there. No, you always win. Let him decide. His foot? His ear? His life? Okay, you gotta choose. Me or him? No! No, no, no! Please! Please, don't! No! Yes? - Is your father at home? - My father? Nice house. Come on in, beaner... What you say to me, kid? I'm not a kid. Is there anything I can do to help you? Hello, this is the Montecito Retirement Home. We've not received payment for three consecutive months. I'm afraid we'll have to evict Mr. Patelski. Pay now. - Okay, kid. - I'm not a kid. Is there anything I can do to help you? Yeah. Your father is an accountant, and I need a good one. Accountant? You don't speak English, or what? Accountant! A-K-U... No. A-Q... - U... - Listen! My father isn't home, so if you wanna come by tomorrow... You must be the gardener! I'm so sorry! I can go get the credit card! It's-- it's-- Listen, you little white brat, son of Donald Trump. - You're not the gardener? - I don't like kids, especially fat white kids like you. Speak to your father, or I'm going to beat the hell out of you. I'm gonna go call the police. I hope you have your visa. - Not like you're illegal, but... - Where is your father? I-- I-- Listen! The bathroom is right over there and I can go upstairs and get you his card, so you can call him. - Great. - Yeah? Okay. Yeah. - Right there! - Oh, that chili... Damn Waldo! God damn it! What the hell was that? G-Good evening! Is anybody ho-ho-home? Don't be afraid, Mr. Accountant. Just give us our money back. What was that? I think someone's taking a piss. Holy shit! What the hell do those gringos eat? Chili con carne? Oh, my eyes! - Look outside. - Okay. Okay. Kid! Is there any other way out? No. And I'm not a kid. Those guys are crazy. You don't wanna mess with them. You think this is a game? Guasa, keep Porky under control! But I'm Po-Porky, asshole! Hand me that sheet. Garza, aren't you supposed to be in jail? Shit! The white sheet! Yes, but my balls were getting itchy. Now's the time to show off your birthday present. Go get it. The white sheet! That one! Guasa, The Accountant's not here, there's only a kid! - This is a bad-bad... - What? A bad idea? No, a badass weapon. Look. I hope your dad doesn't get mad. - How old are you? 14? - I'm 17. - And don't hit me again! - I didn't hit you. I only grabbed your ear, like this. Oh, such a sweet little boy. What are you? A nun? I'm a cop. And I can help your father to get out of this alive. I'm not sure where he is, but listen, tiny Mexican man. If I tell him you hit me, he's gonna fucking destroy you. If you don't tell me where he is right now, I'm gonna take you back to Porky and Guasa, and they will rip your balls off and feed them to you. I need a Pepto. - Be with you in a minute. - Yes. I had never seen a Polish guy in the store before. He's not Polish, he's Irish. I bet you $1 he's Polish. Make it 10. So what can I do you for? Yeah. Listen... That Mexican guy over there was telling me how all you Irish guys, you know, have a... A tiny dick. Personally, I love you, Irish people, but... Irish, right? - Aye! - Hey, kid. Irish. Listen, you fucking Mexican! How do you reckon I shove both me fists up your ass? - What's the hobbit's problem? - Come on, mate! Take a fist! Hey... Don't fuck with Ireland! Come on, lad! You want more? Huh? Come on. Come on. So how much is for the kid's cookies and this? $17.75. Was that really necessary? Keep the change. Well, thank you. - But I think I'm gonna borrow this. - No! Not me gun! It was a gift from the old man. What kind of father gives his son a.44 Magnum? Damn lunatic! Look, Grandpa, I got you the cookies you like. Danke, Alex. I don't understand what you're saying, grandpa. It's your grandson, Vic. Alex is dead. We are going fishing on Sunday, like I promised. Still having debts with asilo Montecito? That hobbit almost killed me, cabron. That's too bad, I would've loved for you to leave me alone. The only reason I'm not kicking your ass right now is because I respect your grandpa here. I'm so sick of you! You come to my house, you bring some whackos with a flamethrower. I didn't bring them, okay? This is your dad's fault. If he wasn't Santo's accountant, none of this would have happened. My father's dead. I'm The Accountant. It's my hacker name. You have a problem with that, fucking Speedy Gonzales? Okay, okay, stop fighting. Talk it out, Vic. Grandpa, you just said my name. Show some respect to Mr. Gonzales. He's an immigrant like you and me, Alex. Don't forget. Bye, Grandpa. Have a good evening. Thanks for coming to see me, Vic. - I'm sorry about your father. - It doesn't matter. Where is your Mom? They both died. They were spies, ambushed by the friggin' Taliban. Wait. How did you meet Santos? What you're talking about? I don't know him. All I did was deactivate some security aids so Krishna could move around the money. So, you helped him steal Santos' money? - Krishna stole that money? - Yeah. Well, that's why there's psychopaths after me. No, Gaspar sent those guys to your house. - Who's Gaspar? - He's the boss. And Santos stole the money from Gaspar. And they think you have the money. No, no, no, no, I don't have the money. I know! You cannot even pay the nursing home. Or buy decent clothes. That's 'cause Krishna owes me 15 grand. Did you sell him your sister, or what? What? Just listen, okay? Do me a favor. Don't run away from me again. Let's go. Let's make a deal. I'll take you to Krishna, you can give me my 20 grand. 20 grand? I thought you'd said 15. - Did I say 15? - Yes. I meant 20. Deal? Deal. It seems those assholes got here before us. This is Krishna? That bastard Guasa. I've never seen anyone take someone's eyes out through their nose. Don't be disgusting, kid! Get to work. This guy's really dead. So you don't have any distraction. I need Krishna's fingerprints, otherwise I'm stuck. Do you have a box cutter? His whole hand. I think this will help. This music will drive you nuts! Which hand? Right hand. Which one? - The right - Right. Okay. Help me out! What? What? - The... The finger. - Okay, go and get it. Hand it to me. Hand it to me! - Okay. - God! Shit, you don't want to help. There we go. - Put it together. - Okay. There we are. He looks thin, but this guy weighs a ton. - Okay, I'm in. - Yeah? I'll handle it. - Who is it? - Nicole. Okay. Yes? And David? Oh! He's busy right now. Yeah. You should've come earlier. He's waiting for me. He's gonna take me dancing. Ah. Dancing. Yeah, well, you're out of luck. I don't know if he's gonna be up for that. He's always up for anything. Yeah, but... Right now he-- he's got a-- - A what? - Runny nose. - He has a cold? - Yes. Yes. And you? Do you wanna go dancing? - It's just the... - I like older men. No, I'm not that... With a long list of experiences to share. That's just my gun. I put David to bed. - What? - He's tired. - Yeah. - What? Come on, we gotta go, sweetie. We're gonna be late! New generations. Let go of me! What did you get? The ass. Come on, man. What did you get? I got the ass! It's... I tried to fish out their last Skype conversation. I didn't have much time. Basically, from what I can tell, ass-man has the token. The token? I want the money. I don't know what the token-- What the fuck is the token? The token is what you need to get the money. It's a small device that grants network access. There we go. It's basically a consistently changing authorization number that millionaires will use to keep hackers like me out of their bank account. Right, the token. He was short, cute and interesting, with a crew cut and a Latino accent. - Garza. - Too bad he's gay. That is not Garza. Krishna needed a banker of some sort. That has to be who this is. I'll tell you what, you give me a couple of minutes and a couple of brewskis, and I'll tell you where he lives. Wouldn't you like a chocolate milkshake, kid? By the way, you owe me 10 bucks. You're right. He was pretty good, though. A guy like you gets a girl like that? How does that happen? I've never had a girlfriend. It's a gorgeous sunny day in Golden Valley, California... You're sure this is it? Good morning, guys. The IP address points his computer to be in this town. Hey. Order the cheapest thing on the menu, okay? I'm running short on cash. Put a face on that ass. Ow. I'll be right back. - Ah! No! This is bad! - You okay, buddy? I've been there, man, trust me. No, don't do it! You'll regret it. Let me buy you a drink and you can tell me all about it, okay? Thank you, thank you. You're my friend, right? - I am your friend, don't worry. - Let's get a drink. - Wait a second. - That was close. Sorry, sweetie, no kids allowed. D'you have a pen? - Oh, sure. - Yeah, thanks. Step outside on this beautiful morning, just make sure you're wearing plenty of sunscreen. Man, that sun is burning! It's illegal to burn people in this country. He was annoying, wasn't he? It's $23. $6 for the beer, $17 for the double margarita. One more double. Thanks. Did you s-s-see? A stuffed-toy machine. I've always wanted to get one for Porky's Bar. Why? Porky's Bar is a whorehouse. No, it's not. It's more like a ca-ca-cabaret. Hey. Do you know the banker who works across the street? Yeah. It's that guy. - You're the banker? - You have my gun. No, no, no, no! I left it in the toilet. Hey. I was here first. Better to be late than in bad company. That's not how it goes, asshole. Guasa, the banker is mine. Don't make Porky mad, he has a short fuse. Ah, shit! I torture the banker, get the token and I let you live. Let's not torture the banker, I'll just give you the token. You're not giving him anything. You know I love coming here, right? You see? That's my baby, right there. Yeah. Hi, guys! Hi, sweetie. Give me the token, then I'll decide whether to beat the shit out of you. What do you think? You won't make it. You know if I poke your artery, you will die in three minutes, right? I'm gonna need that fucking margarita. Hey, kid. Do you have any coins? Yeah, but if you kill him, he dies without telling us where the token is. Let's not kill him. I'll just show you where the token is. - All right? - Okay. I don't have any, uh... Have any more... It's okay, I understand. Now he brings the fucking margarita. Take this and get yourself something, okay? Okay. ...made some pretty covers back in the day. Here is their classic, but in español. This is called... It's okay! It's okay! He told me all the waitresses here love Mexicans. - And she liked it. - What? Hey! - Take it easy. - Freeze, asshole! We don't want any trouble. We're just leaving. Take out your pi-pi... Drop your pi-pi... Drop your fucking guns, you motherfuckers! You should speak English all the time, you don't stutter. - I know! - Do not use that thing in here. - Yeah, seriously, Porky! - Yeah, seriously, Porky! Hey, kid! Kid! Get out of here! You shouldn't see this. Come on, boy. Go. - Thank you! - Go. And the kid? Why does he get to go? I'm gonna get you out of here, baby. It's gonna be okay. Did he tell you where the token is? - No, he's too drunk! - Then sober him up! - Fucking Mexicans... - Sprinklers? That was nice. Waitress kiss? That was hot. One hour later Alvin. Find out what happened here. I'd like to know. And you wanted double margaritas? How much did he drink, man? He's like not even... He's not even breathing. He's dead. - What? - He's dead. What? Dead?! He's dead? Shut up, kid! There's a trooper ahead! Act normal. All right, pull the car over, get Weekend at Bernie off me! He's useless now. - The token. - He didn't tell me. The token! What do you want me to do? He didn't say anything. He has the token! - The token? - Yes, the token. - Oh, man! - Okay... So what are we gonna do with the dead guy? "He wants to cry." You know? Like... - He wants to cry! - He wants to cry! You have everything? Token, accounts... I'll deactivate some security gates and then, uh... - you can give me my 25 grand. - Twenty-five? Now I understand why Porky and Guasa want to kill you, you little shit. Porky? Porky's mi amigo. We located the suspects in a two-door convertible, heading south towards the border. Please notify Border Patrol. Shit! - What? - The trooper. - Garza... - What? - The car's stolen. - What? Dispatch, this is Charlie David 4. We're in pursuit of three male Caucasian suspects. Requesting backup. We're coming in. Let's get out of here! Oh, shit! Mexican in trouble! The kid's with me! Calm down, my friends. Hey, let us through. Those two are wanted. Welcome to Mexico. Let's go. You should know that no armed foreigner can step into Mexico without a federal permit. Oh, man. Only if you are planning to invade Mexico. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Just go to the office, fill out the forms. Follow the rules, like nice gringos. So you see that we can be arrogant pricks, too. You gotta be the first gringo to cross the desert back into Mexico without papers. So, where is your girlfriend? I don't know. Santos kidnapped her. Are you serious? Yes. I'm with you now. And I adore you. I'm sorry, buddy. I thought those things only happened in the movies. Bad movies... - Perfect! - Wait, wait, wait! Oh, those assholes! We have to run. - What? - Run! Come on, run! That revolver only has six shots! You have three left! Two. - You're out! - I know! What are we gonna do? - Run, you little shit! - Yes. The three of you couldn't catch a short guy and a kid? They got away from me in the desert. Don't worry. It's not a big deal. Bingo! What? Is your grandfather wiring us money? Why the hell do you wanna go there? What do you think, they wire money in an envelope? They have Internet. Listen, chubby, don't be such a jerk. I know what pendejo means. Jerk! Hi. Your name doesn't match. This is for Emilia L. Aguilar, and your ID says Emilia Aguilar. It's me. I dropped the "L" for "Leticia" a long time ago. Look, that's not my problem. Good afternoon, officer. We're looking for two guys. A gringo kid and a short guy called Garza. They're on foot, they can't be far. I have other customers to serve, miss. Next! Santos and your boss will thank you. Miss, bring that money back here! - Wait! Stop! - It's my money! Call the police! It's my money! - Somebody stop her! - Stop, Emilia! - What are you doing here? - I knew I'd catch up to you! Such a small world and so little shame. Don't act tough with me. - What's your name? - Juan Jose Hernandez. We've spent two years searching for her. She took the "L" from her stepfather's name, Lieberman. And her mother's from Lithuania, but that's irrelevant. Thank you for your cooperation. I'm Colonel Sanders, Special Forces, KFC. Let's go. Come on. - Do you have a car? - Yes. - Where did you come from? - Don't ask. Let's go before the cops get here. - Get in, get in, get in! - It didn't finish, man! - Get in! - Where are we going? Who are you? Okay, guys, this is as far as we go. Thanks for your help, but I have enough problems. But you're the one who got us into trouble. Are you kidding me? I saw how you were hiding from the cops. They're looking for you. They're after you too, aren't they? And my story is complicated. Oh, really? Well, then, you can tell someone else. Open the damn door and get out! Didn't you hear me? Open the damn door and get out! - Go to hell. - No. Can you please just take us with you? Please? Just drop us off at the next city that you go through, just don't leave us here. WANTED This is unit 4. I'm looking for a 7-35 on the 4-27. This is urgent! It's illegal to ki-ki-kill police officers in this country, Guasa. - They were so annoying. - I'm reporting a 7-16. A woman was taken hostage by a fat blond boy and a short man wearing a leather jacket. They're driving a blue Wagoneer. Blue, my ass. Proceed with caution, these men are dangerous. No, I'm not running away from anything. I want to start over somewhere else. I want to open up a restaurant by the sea and leave the desert behind... ...all the bad memories. You'll do it. I'm sure you will. - Thanks. - Bye. So why did Santos kidnap your girlfriend? He wanted me to help him escape from prison. Maria is pregnant. Oh, my God! And he killed my compadre. What is "compadre"? Have you ever seen the movie El padrino? The Godfather? It's got nothing to do with that. You don't like all the members of your family, right? Surely you have a cousin that you hate? No, I don't have any cousins. Well, think... think of someone that is not your blood, but you really like and trust, and you wish he could be your family. So when you have a son, you could ask him to be "el padrino," and that makes him your "compadre." So I could be your compadre. No. I already had one. Here we are. Diego Garza. Ramirez. What are you doing here? I came to arrest you. - Yeah, right. - You think I'm joking? You're an example to many. What did you do? You sold yourself to Santos for money. That's not true. Talk to Coronado, he can explain it all. No, you'll provide your own explanations. We have ex-Lieutenant Garza. We're at the corner of Juarez and 4th in an Internet cafe. I repeat, we have ex-Lieutenant Garza at an Internet cafe on the corner of Juarez and 4th. I'm just about to get Santos and clear up all of this mess. Put yourself in my shoes. Even if I believed you, there's nothing I can do for you. Cuff him. I can help you. I'll take you to Santos so you can return his money. You don't have the balls to shoot someone while they look you in the eye. Go on. Take aim, shoot. You don't have the balls? I'll lend you mine. Porky? I'm here, it's all right. If what you say is true... ...go and get Santos. I'm sick of all of the shit in this profession. Make people trust us again. Let's go! Come on! - You got everything? - Yeah! Move it! Hurry! Get in! Hurry! Clutch! Clutch! - I owe you one. - So we're even, then. Go, go, go, go, go! They weren't spies. Who? My parents. They weren't spies. They died in a car accident when I was one, left me with my grandpa. I barely knew them. Except for, like, photos and stories my grandpa told me... Stuff like that. When you lose someone really close, it takes away a part of you. You feel lost. Sometimes, you may meet people along the way that will help you find yourself. What about you? It's a long story. - We got time. - We got time. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Go find your girlfriend and have that baby of yours. Make sure to bring him to the beach. I'll have a place there, lunch's on me. Good luck. Good evening. Yes? Do you have a double room available? That will be 550 pesos. Or $60. Well, we don't have any money right now. You have no money. But my friend will be coming tomorrow to pick us up. - Your friend. - Yes. And I can leave my watch with you. My friend has the watch, but as soon as he gets here... Listen. Why don't you get the hell out of here and stop wasting my time? Jesus! Where did you get that? My friend Porky. Room 17, it's to your left. What about the change? It's 100, breakfast is included. Good night. - What about the Internet? - Do you have Internet? Our Internet hasn't worked in two months. Doesn't work. If it's broken, I can maybe try to fix it for you. He's good. - What's going on? - Everything's fine, Dad. Good evening. Good evening. - Here you are. - Thank you. My dad wants me to stay here forever. But doing what? A receptionist for life? What do you wanna be? What brings you here? I'm a police officer. Well, I was. They kidnapped my girlfriend, she was pregnant. I think she's still alive. I want to find her... and get revenge. No, my friend. Revenge is not the way forward. If you want to find her again, you have to think things through carefully. Maybe I can go to L.A. with you and try to become, you know... You're beautiful, like... You could be anything. You really think I can become a hooker? I have Valeria with me. They killed her mother when she was very young. And I had the son of a bitch in front of me. I could've shot him. But I chose not to kill him. You know, I like taking pictures. What do you like taking pictures of? Me. Do you wanna see them? Sure. Do you like them? Yeah. By the way, I didn't mean to call you a hooker. But if that's really what you wanna do, then just... charge a lot of money. I will! - Is everything ready? - Oh, yes. Yes. Okay, I... I'm gonna let you work, and I'm going to bed. - Good night. - Good night. That's a lot of woman for you, isn't it? Let's get to work. Be careful with the token. What a pleasure to see you. Hand it all over, I want the token, the passwords... I want the money! And make it fast. Santos is not a patient man. Stop! I press this button, all the money goes to the FBI. It'll be gone forever. What did he say? He has a naked photo of your sister. What did he say? If he presses that button, you'll lose the money. No, he's bluffing. Kid, don't do anything stupid. Don't call him a kid, he doesn't like it. It drives him crazy and makes him push buttons. - Let go of me! - Look what I found. - Valeria? - Vic... There's always a weak link in every negotiation. - No hard feelings, Garza. - Let her go! Let her go! Hurry, Mouse! Make sure it's all there. Hey! What the hell are you doing here? What do you think you can do with two shots? Don't you know how to count? These two shots are for you, asshole. I don't want to dirty the man's carpet, so I'll leave. Where is Maria? Maria... I don't have the heart to tell you. It's better if you hear it from God. Let's go. If you'll excuse us. Are you okay, darling? We're fucked. Grandpa is fucked. I might have met the one girl in the world who actually likes me... and I'll never see her again. Everything is so fucked! Yeah. You're right, you know? Maybe I should have just went back to that cop, Dalton. Yeah, you should've. You wouldn't be nagging me now. Get on. What are we gonna do, man? You can't give up now. Hello? Damn... - Hello? - Garza. What happened? Are you all right? Yes. Everybody thinks that you killed Ramirez. If they find out you're in Mexicali, they'll come for you. You should get out of there. Garza... Did you hang up? How do you know I'm in Mexicali? I just assumed you were. Right... Thanks for letting me know, I'll leave now. You know you can count on me. Thank you, Commander. I brought you Maria's cell phone. I thought you'd like to have it. Cell phones can be traced, right? Yeah. Get your friend out of here. And now? If those idiots don't find him? Garza's my friend. He'll come looking for me. As soon as he uses Maria's phone, we'll pick him up. Right, Mouse? We'll be able to locate him as soon as he turns it on. What a pleasure to see you. Damn it! Let's go get your 35 grand. I thought we said 40. Sounds good to me, man. Yes, Santos. He must be on his way out of Mexicali right now. If you need to confirm where he is, Mouse can find him using the GPS. I'll see you shortly at the Camaron Vaquero restaurant, bye. Santos is your friend? POLICE OFFICER OF THE YEAR "For your excellent service and integrity. Ruben Coronado Lopez. Police Officer of the Year." Relax, Garza, this isn't what you think. I can explain everything. - What are you going to explain? - It's not easy. Yeah, it's very easy to explain. You're a piece of shit. You let them take Maria so that I'd find the money for you. Isn't that right, asshole? Give me your savings. It wasn't personal, I had no choice. I knew you'd get the money back. I only need 40. I saved your life! Santos wanted you dead, my friend. Even best friends can't be trusted. You're a goddamn traitor. You wanted your money, right, asshole? Here. 40 grand. Get your life together, okay? Get a girlfriend or... ...take your grandpa to Poland. Thank you, Diego. What are you gonna do? I'm going to the Camaron Vaquero. - Sounds like a suicide mission. - Nah. I have to find her. Promise me you won't die. I swear. Do you believe in God? Who do you swear to? I swear to you. Hurry up. The bus is waiting. Bye. - It's just my lousy ex-commander. - I thought so. Close friends, not best friends. Get out. What did you say? The saying is, "Even close friends can't be trusted." You drive. Get in. It's very nice. - Don't you have anything to do? - Yeah, sure. - You wanna see it? - No, I'm going. I shouldn't be out in the street at this hour. I'm leaving now. I live over this way. Get out. G-Gaspar is going to cut our balls off, Guasa. Our balls, Guasa! The d-d-door was... It was o-open. The party's over, Clown. You guys want $10 million? - Who is it? - Coronado. Open the door. Hello, Santos. If you don't want your friend to die, you'll tell me where I can find Maria. I don't have any friends, Garza. You killed Mouse, assholes! How will I de-activate the alarms now? Take it easy, Santos. Give me your weapon. Give it to me. Look at the mess you've made! It was such a beautiful little place. I'll give you Coronado's share, and we'll be even. No, thanks, I'm already rich. It's $5 million. Not too shabby. You should buy another bar, this place is outdated. What did I tell you? What did you say? Maria. Isn't love wonderful? Your eyes even sparkled. - Are you all right? - Yes. Here's your money. Okay? Do you want it? You're coming with me and Maria until we get into the car. You let me go and I'll release Maria. Then I'll kill you and keep my money. - What do you think? - Go to hell. What if I kill the baby first and then your girlfriend? Let her go. I'm burning, put the fire out! Put it out! Porky! Guasa! Who's the kid now? Huh? That's for the shoes. Asshole! Get up. Maria... You little shit! It seems you've lost all of your men. Put down your gun, Diego. Maria. What are you doing? We're going to be parents. I'm not pregnant. I never was pregnant. What a bitch! Why did you come back? It would've been easier to never see you again. You've caused so much trouble. You goddamn little gringo! Goodbye, Garza. Kill him. No. Hold your fire! Freeze! Don't move! Where are Santos and Garza? - They're gone. - Search the place! Quickly! Okay, you're clear. Let's get you out of here, kid. You're in some deep shit. Ever spend time in a Mexican prison? - What? No! - Watch your head. I'll come visit. Dr. Ramirez, please go to Emergency. - What happened? - She was shot. - What's her blood type? - I don't know. We need two units of O-Negative blood. Are you family? I have to ask you to leave. - You'll be fine. - You have to leave now. Marlin Monroe Pier 32, Ensenada - Who is it? - It's your fucking mother. What an idiot. Oops, I hit the token. - Thank you very much. - Go now before I change my mind. - Thanks. - You take care of him. - I will. - Okay. - I was starting to miss you. - Yeah? No. - Let's get some coffee. - Okay. Lieutenant... Did I do that to you? - I'm sorry. - It's nothing, I'm fine. Here, from Chief Osorno. He's expecting you on Monday to welcome you back. No, but thank him for me. In fact, tell him I've gone on vacation. I'm going to rest and scratch my balls. One year later... I only asked you for one beer. The other one's for me. You're still too young, you can't drink yet. I'm 18 now. But you're a gringo, you have to be 21. - You're not a cop anymore. Yeah. - Oh, really? - Really? Are you being serious? - Yeah. You look even shorter without your badge. What a smartass. But you know what? You don't need a badge. You need balls. Attitude, you know? - Hello, my love. - Hey there, sweetheart. Garza asked me to be the godfather. An American godfather? Impressive! He'll be more like the fat aunt than the godfather. - What? - Nah... Stop moving around so much. That's not what you said last night. Cheers! Too many beers. If you don't want me as godfather, I'm okay with that. A Mexican never pisses alone. You're family now.
