(Brakes squeal) Hang Arjun! - Hang him! Hang him! Arjun Ranawat is a killer! - He is a murderer! Arjun Ranawat is a killer! - He is a murderer! Arjun Ranawat is a killer! - He is a murderer! Hang Arjun! - Hang him! Hang him! Hang Arjun! - Hang him! Hang him! Hang Arjun! - Hang him! Hang him! Hang Arjun! Your Honor. This is ACP Arjun Ranawat. He barged into the prime minister's farm house.. ..on the night of 1st November.. ..and brutally killed the deputy prime minister.. ..Badrinath Trivedi, his son, Munna Trivedi.. ..the police commissioner Yeshwant's son.. ..Chandrakant Deshpande.. ..police inspector Avasthi, advocate Kulkarni.. ..the six MLAs of the reigning political party.. ..and counting some government and police officers.. ..all in all, 18 people. Your Honor. He isn't the guardian of the law, but its abuser. With this cold blooded massacre.. ..not only has he maligned.. ..the government and police, but even humanity. These are some of the photographs.. ..taken from the crime scene, Your Honor. Your Honor. The police requests the accused.. ..to be kept in remand for fifteen days to investigate.. ..this brutal massacre and the reason for it. Arjun Ranawat, do you want to say anything about these accusations? No. Do you have a lawyer? - No. Would you wish the court to appoint a lawyer for you? No. The government has accused you of killing 18 innocent civilians. It has asked for a remand of 15 days for investigation. Do you want anything during this time? Do you have the need for anything? Yes, I do. - What is it? Death. The accused, Arjun Ranawat, is placed into police custody.. ..for 15 days in remand. 'While claiming that he was perfectly sane..' '..Ranawat said that he has committed this massacre in sound mind.' 'When the judge asked him whether he needed anything..' '..he answered what he had said before. Death.' 'Vandana Sajnani, Aaj Tak, Mumbai.' Yeshwant Deshpande. Is this the charge sheet you've prepared? Is this it? Just a murderer? He isn't a murderer! He is a demon! Come. Look at this! Look at this! He snatched away my son, my brother and my son-in-law from me! He wiped off the vermilion from the foreheads.. ..of my daughter-in-law and my daughter. He even got your son, didn't he? Aren't you sad about that? He didn't leave anyone to light our funeral pyres. He vanquished our bloodline! Our dynasty! Listen to me, Tyagi. Bad character. Corruption. Bad thoughts. Betrayal of the country. Even to the extent of calling him a traitor. Accuse him of every crime written in your law book.. ..and label him a lawless character. Slap all the sections of your law on him! Release his chains. Sign these documents. Arjun Ranawat. You have killed my only son. Until the court punishes you.. ..I will give you a new death every day in this prison. Deshpande, he hasn't signed these documents. He has placed his life into death's hands. Please come. Son. Why did you put down your weapons in the court today? Why don't you tell the world why you massacred them? Why are you asking for death for yourself, son? Why are you doing it? Because I have performed my last rites. I wish freedom from my body and this birth. Mother. From today, both you and Rakhi.. ..please don't come to meet me here. Because in the Hindu religion.. ..mothers and sisters don't attend funerals and enter cemeteries. I'll leave now, Mother. We were to be together for just this long in this birth. Don't cry when I die. I'll be back again. Ask your God to make me your son next time too. Respected Mr. Samar Singh. My final salute to you and your principles. I've walked away from your principles.. ..this uniform and this police force. I have a final request of you, sir. Please don't say 'Truth always triumphs' ever again. Because the truth is that in this eunuch-like society.. ..lies.. ..unlawfulness.. ..and injustice are always victorious. I want to tell you, sir. We soldiers are not mere government machinery. Outside the police station, even we have a life. We don't know where we lost it while walking on your given path. So, you're here still. You haven't gone to the temple. Didn't I tell you, son? Mother. What will I do going to the temple? You've worshipped your body for too long now. Come and worship God too, son. (Sighs) You want me to go to the temple and pray to God? Yes. I'll be very grateful to you. Where are you taking me? - Come here. Sit down. Okay. 'Hail the Goddess Jagdambe, Hail Goddess Durga" 'Hail Goddess Kali, Hail Goddess Saraswati" You crazy boy, what are you doing? Don't you see, mother? I am praying to my God. It's been truly said. God can't be everywhere at one time. That's why he created mother. Mother, you are my temple and every deity. Are you crazy? A mortal man is never compared to God, son. Is it so? Do you remember the '1984 riots, Mother? When a child was crying over his dead parents? God hadn't come at that time. You had, Mother. My real mother had just given birth to me. You've given me my life though. My existence is because of you. Only because of you, Mother. I gave birth to Rakhi. But you're a piece of my heart. I didn't ask for anything after getting you. Why are you lying, Mother? You pray for brother's wellbeing from morning to evening.. ..and yet you say that you don't ask God for anything? Rakhi, keep quiet. You're just jealous. Because mother loves me more. What? I'm jealous of you? My foot! Oh, God! She's in the mood to fight. I haven't come to fight. I have come to tell you that I'm going to college.. ..and I've taken Rs.1000 from your wallet. Did you see that, Mother? Robbery in a policeman's house. I didn't rob anyone. I've just taken what is mine by right. By the way, I have served breakfast. When you both mother and son complete your tearful reunion.. ..please have it. I'll be very grateful. I'll leave now. Bye. Bye, Mom. Did you see that, mother? Rakhi has grown up. Yes, son. When the daughter grows up.. ..a mother worries even more. What are you talking about, mother? Does a cow ever feel that her horns are heavy? You worry about Rakhi's marriage, don't you? Yes. - Don't worry. Your son will get his sister married with such pomp and splendor.. ..that the whole world will be stunned. (Police siren wails) (Brakes squeal) Greetings, Lukkha brother! Did you see, sir? Even a hero's not as famous as Hakim Lukkha is! (Laughs) Come on! What is the hurry, sir? I am human too. Why are you dragging me like a beast? Sir, will I get a smoke? Shut up and walk, you wretch. Let the judge get you in police custody once.. ..I'll give you good cigarettes in the lock up after that. That will be decided with the judge's verdict. Your Honor. When these police men were accusing.. ..Hakim Lukkha of cutting off the.. ..prostitutes nose and ears, he wasn't.. ..in Mumbai city forget about Grant Road. He had gone to Lucknow. For the party's work. Your Honor. This is the proof of the police's wretchedness. This is the air ticket to Lucknow. This is the register of the guesthouse in Lucknow.. And Your Honor, this is the manager of that guesthouse in Lucknow. Your Honor. This lawyer is lying! Hakim Lukkha is a pimp. This scoundrel whores innocent girls. Did you hear that? Did you hear that, your honor? This is the respected police of our Mumbai city. They abuse people right here in court. ACP Arjun Ranawat. If you use any abusive and vulgar language in this court the next time.. ..you will be suspended. This time, I'm letting you go with just a warning. Please don't waste the court's time by bringing such matters here. The accused is released honorably. I've told you a thousand times. Be respectful in the court. They are ripping our shirts apart. And you're saying that we should respect them? Didn't I show you your place in court, Mr. Arjun? I had said it. I had announced it, Lawyer. That this time too, Hakim Lukkha will be released. Why? What did you do? Actually, sir. Messing with me is dangerous for you. And dangerous for your sister, too. I've heard that your sister is very beautiful, sir. No, Arjun! Wait, Arjun! I say, stop it. (Glass shatters) I say, leave him, Arjun. I said leave him alone. Compose yourself! Are you crazy? Get up, Brother Lukkha. Get up. Hey, Kulkarni. Take this pimp away! Hey, explain it to your hero! These wrestling antics of his will prove very expensive to him! I'll have his uniform snatched! You will have my uniform snatched? Come on. Arjun. (Snaps finger) Hey, take him away. - I am going. But explain to this hero. Enmity with a lawyer will prove very costly. Come on, Brother Lukkha. Let's go. Enough, Arjun. It is enough. What enough? You always stop me. That wretched Hakim Lukkha.. ..spat on our faces and we couldn't do anything. And you tell me to stop? See this. Do you see this? The government has hung a gun around our waist. But we can't use it. And those scoundrels shoot in the middle of the street. And what do we do? What do we do? We just take those pimps into the magistrate's presence. And then Kulkarni comes and releases them. And what do we do? We hold this in our hands and stand. Get up.That pimp is not wworth irritating your brains. Let's go! - You go. I'll be here a while. Yes, why will you come? It's time for your angel to come. You've started it all over again? - You scoundrel. Why are you shy of speaking what's in your heart since a long time? She has expressed her love to you a thousand times over. And you.. Haider, please go. I'll go. It's bad to suggest anything to anyone nowadays. And listen, don't drink a lot. You'll be driving. Jannat, did your lover give you a flying kiss today too? Thank you for your sympathy. Jannat, all rich people are at your feet. And you are dying for a policeman? What does he have? You won't understand, my dear. Rich and generous people are found in this bar. But l can see only lust and hunger.. ..in the eyes of every man here. But Arjun. l see respect and conscience in Arjun''s eyes. You crazy girl, till wwhen wwill you wait for him like this? For my whole life. And if that is less, l will give my next life to him too. This ring that l wwear in my neck. Only Arjun will make me wwear this. She wwon't understand. (Brakes squeal) (Engine not starting) (Tires squealing) Did you recognize me? Lukkha. Hakim Lukkha. (Laughs) What are you staring at, sir? You'll just have to speak to me with respect, okay? Respectable people are spoken to with respect. (Bottle shatters) Who do you call a pimp? (Snaps finger) See this street. It is deserted. Neither a man, nor any sign of humans. Look here too. Look. You can't see anyone till afar. If I kill you here right now.. ..nobody will get any proof or any witness.. ..about who killed ACP Arjun Ranawat. There will only be your photo in the newspaper tomorrow. And your sister will be in my jeep from tomorrow. I'll leave now. (Snaps finger) Think about what I told you. Work for me. Or else, an unknown death may occur. (Laughs) 'He is correct. A lonely street, unknown death.' 'What if I kill him here?' Hey, Lukkha. Yes, tell me. What do you want to tell me? Thanks for the suggestion. Suggestion? (Groans) Hey! (Gunshot) (Screaming in pain) (Screaming in pain) Look here. Empty street. Look here. No man, nor any sign of humans. (Screaming in pain) And the papers tomorrow will carry your photograph, not mine. Unknown death. No! No! (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) Arjun Ranawat, your activities last night.. ..have shaken the entire city of Mumbai and the government. Your murdering spree has slandered the police force's reputation. Look at this. Look at this and look at this. While some are calling us uniformed hooligans.. ..others are calling us uniformed devils. You will have to bear its punishment. Write on that paper.. ..that you lost your anger and sanity and murdered them. I didn't massacre them in anger or insanity. I did it in self-defense. It was an act of self-defense. Act of self-defense? My foot! Don't think me to be a fool. One doesn't break 17 bones in someone's body in self-defense. He doesn't make him lay on his back.. ..and empty the entire magazine of his gun. This is the autopsy report. Have you not read the procedure code? You must warn a criminal first. Then bullets are shot in the air and later on the legs. And then, you could inform the control room too. You are right, sir. I committed a huge mistake. When his revolver was below my ear.. ..and he was about to press the trigger.. ..I should have called up the control room. Then I should have fired in the air once. After that, I should have fired at his legs. You are right, sir. I committed such a huge mistake. Sir, that wretch was talking about killing me.. ..and making my sister a courtesan. At that time, I should have told him, "Brother, please wait". "It is a crime to kill a police officer and make his sister a courtesan." I'm sorry, sir. But if I had walked on your path.. ..my name wouldn't be written here.. ..but outside the police station.. ..on the list of personnel dead in the line of fire. And you wouldn't be shouting here. You would be shedding tears over my bullet-ridden body.. ..wrapping it in the Indian tricolor flag and playing the bugle. Shut up. There is a limit to insolence and shamelessness. Did you see that, sir? I say, we should declare him a killer and set an example for others. Why not, sir? If you want to clean up the good-for-nothing and useless image.. ..of the police force with the blood of an upright police officer.. ..you are most welcome. Nobody has any proof that I did these killings. Neither you, nor you were present at the murder site. You can only declare me a killer, but you can't prove it. And I won't say this. My lawyer will say this in court. And nobody will have any answer to this. Sir.. This Hakim Lukkha had 38 cases against him. He had started thinking of the police station as his house.. ..his house as a brothel.. ..and police officers like me as his pimp. What had we done to him? Sir.. In 12 years of this police service.. ..I've died a thousand deaths at their hands. I had just two ways out. Either I would live on Lukkha's scraps and barter the law.. ..or I'd put down this uniform.. ..and tolerate everything like a eunuch. No, sir. I refused to be a pimp or eunuch. Sir, if these criminals can be released by court.. ..and allowed to move around like innocent civilians.. ..then why can't I, Arjun Ranawat, kill them.. ..and move around like an innocent civilian? Why? Do you want to say anything else? No, sir. You may go. He is speaking the truth, sir. But sadly, what can be done? That's what we will have to think of, Jadhav.. ..what we'll have to do in such a situation. No, sir. Punishing Arjun is not a solution to this problem. What is the solution to this problem? Encounter! Encounter? Yes, we won't catch them in a clash. We'll kill them. We'll encounter them. When the criminals see this terror hovering around them.. ..they will see only two ways out for themselves. Give up or die. Surrender or death. And only then will the dream of a crime-free country come true. Are you ready for this? You ready the Crime Control Squad, Mr. Samar Singh. My government is with you. Hands up! Police? run. This is too much, brother. The police that would shiver in fear when they'd hear of you.. ..the same police has now killed 27 of our men in only 13 days. Yes, brother. This Mumbai Police has shaken up this same Mumbai city in 25 days.. ..which we ruled for 25 years. The police has become synonymous with death today. They don't arrest or ask for surrender. That commissioner tells them to kill directly. Brother, that CM has backed the police. Therefore, the lowliest of the officers.. ..laugh at Zafar Supari's face. I'll tell you, brother. Just say the word. I'll go and blow up that commissioner's head right away. I'll show the Mumbai police that one must not touch a live snake. Majid. Call that opposition leader Kashi Trivedi. Tell him to create a hullabaloo.. ..by branding the police as the murderers of the Dalits(low-caste sect).. ..minorities and the innocent in the parliament. Through the accusations of fake encounters in the press.. ..make life difficult for the policemen and the government. Shake up that CM. I will show the CM and the commissioner.. ..that the government with whose backing they prance about proudly.. ..is run by Zafar Supari sitting in a foreign country. Down with the killer police! Down with the heartless government. Down with the killer police! Down with the heartless government. Down with the killer police! Down with the uniformed hooligans! Down with the heartless government. Down with the killer police! Mr. Trivedi, if you want to create a ruckus here too.. ..just like at the parliament.. ..what is the meaning of this meeting? What is your problem after all? I don't have a problem. I have a question. Till when will your police.. ..carry out bloodshed on the streets of the city of Mumbai? Until the last one of this city's gangsters isn't dead. Until we don't achieve the objective of a crime-free state. Until then. - Mr. Chief Minister.. ..please make your crazy commissioner understand.. ..that he needs to stop shedding the blood of Dalits and minority groups. Kashi Trivedi, politicians like you shed blood. Not the police. Who created fights in the country regarding temples and mosques? You did. The Brahmins against Yadavs in Bihar.. ..the Thakurs against Dalits in UP.. ..and the Muslims against Hindus in Gujarat. Who did all this? You did. Just for a few votes, you get a brother to kill his own brother. Then you warm yourselves with their funeral pyres. That's what politicians like you do, not the police. Human rights violator! Human rights violator! You are accusing me? Me! I'll topple Satyanarayan Joshi's government in a snap. (Snaps finger) I'll topple your chair, understood? I'll bring you down to a constable from a commissioner. (Laughs) Kashi Trivedi. Whose human rights are you speaking about? Those hooligans, who don't consider humans as humans? Those who shoot at innocent people? Who widow their wives and orphan their children? Kashi Trivedi, are you praising their human rights? They aren't humans. How can we have a human consideration for them? They are inhuman. They just understand one language. This one. Shut up! You mere police inspector! You're flying high on their strength, aren't you? This chief minister's days are on thin ice now. I'll transfer this commissioner as soon as.. ..I become the chief minister. And as for you.. ..if I don't make you salute me everyday.. ..my name won't be Kashi Trivedi! Then listen to what I say too, Kashi Trivedi. The day I get some proof against you.. ..you won't be sitting on the chief minister's chair.. ..but on your funeral pyre. And I promise you, Kashi Trivedi. You won't even get one man to shoulder your funeral. Mr. Encounter Specialist. You have turned this city into Gestapo. You have colored the streets of this city red with blood.. ..in the last 30 days. What do you have to say about this? Is this not the death of democracy? How long will you kill in the name of humanity? What is the difference between the police and the hooligans? Is this encounter your helplessness or greed? Encounter is murder of democracy. It's dictatorship. What is the need of murdering under the pretext of encounters? It is necessary. There is a necessity. What do you think? When we go to arrest them.. ..do the criminals wait with garlands for us? They welcome us with a spray of bullets and dangerous weapons. It is our moral right to shoot in self-defense at that time. It is our democratic right. Do only criminals and terrorists have human rights? Doesn't a soldier have any human rights? Are we soldiers not human? Mr. Encounter Specialist. Zafar Supari has threatened to kill.. ..every person in the encounter squad. He has made a hit list of the entire encounter squad. What hit list will that pimp make? We have made a hit list. Look at this. Do you see these red marks? These are with God today. Soon, the rest will be too. Take this hit list. Print it in your newspaper tomorrow. The next time Zafar Supari gives you a telephonic interview.. ..tell him that we have started striking off his name.. ..from the ration cards. (Brakes squeal) Bye! Hello! Hey. I've come to drop you till your home. Won't you call me in? l mean, tea or something? Oh, tea! Yes, l am your lover, l love you. l have that much right at least. Okay. So come in, Mr.Vivek Acharya. Please come in. You will be made to drink tea and with that.. ..you wwill be introduced to my brother too. What! Brother is at home.. l mean, is he home? He is a policeman. When he''s at home.. ..when he is in the station, when he.. ..goes to do someone''s encounter.. ..even the almighty doesn't know that. Okay, Miss Rekha, l mean, Miss Rakhi, l will leave. Why? Don't you want any tea or something? Tea? l won't even be able to drink water now. Why? Aren't you scared of brother? Scared? The whole city is afraid of your brother. He speaks less with his mouth and more with his gun. You fool! lf you don't meet brother, how will you ask me for your hand? Madam!That is your responsibility. Mr.Vivek Acharya, son of Justice Acharya. l will talk to my brother. But when will you talk to your dad? Leave him to me. Once that our marriage case.. ..reaches in his court, his decision will be in our side. Okay. Love you. Take care. Okay. Bye. - Bye. Brother.. there is a boy. He studies in your college. BSc. Final Year. His name is Vivek Acharya, Justice Acharya's son. The two of you love each other. How do you know that, Brother? I am a policeman, not a milkman. I keep an eye on the entire city. Won't I know whom my sister meets, and where and when? Do you take me for a fool? Do you love him? - No. What? - Yes. Look at me. Good choice. Really, Brother? Yes. Yahoo! I'll talk to his father. It is a matter of pride to make your sister.. ..my daughter-in-law. But.. ..remember that we're from the boy's side. We have some conditions. They'll get engaged tomorrow. Tomorrow? But we need some time for the arrangements. No, nothing doing. The engagement should take place tomorrow. It is an order. But sir.. You're not in a hurry. I'm in a hurry though. If your sister changes her mind.. ..my son won't get such a good wife.. ..and I won't get such a good daughter-in-law anywhere else. (Laughs) Therefore, the engagement ceremony will be held here tomorrow.

Zafar Supari.. ..he has given (clicks tongue)... a contract to kill the commissioner. And Zafar Supari's main hitman is Pappu Kalia. He has a master plan, sir. And to succeed in his contract, he's going to meet.. ..four to five shooters at the 'Can Can' nightclub tonight. Okay, you can go. Goodbye sir. (Music) "Oh darling! Oh darling!" "Oh darling!

Or else I'll kill this girl. I'm telling you to drop your weapon. Or else, this girl will lose her life. I'm telling you for the last time, Arjun. Drop your weapon! I'm telling you to drop your weapon. Drop it! (Laughs) (Grunts) (Gunshot) Kashi Trivedi! I made you a minister from a milkman. I made you an MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly).. ..and a leader of the opposition. For what? For this day? So you can give milk sitting in the parliament? Hey, Kashi! Pappu Kalia is dead. One by one, all my lead men have been killed.. ..by that police commissioner of yours. My reign of 25 years over Mumbai.. ..has been destroyed by your Mumbai police. And there, you have ruined my name in front of the ISI. Do something, Minister. Think of a solution to this. Relieve us off this problem. I have a solution for this, Don Zafar. But it will cost you a hefty price. I was just wondering when you would bark for more money. Okay, then. Tell me how much. Then listen to me carefully, Supari. The government of Chief Minister Satyanarayan Joshi.. ..is supported by only 11 independent MLAs. And from those 11, nine are ready to be bribed. The cost is Rs. 600 millions. That means with Rs. 600 millions you can become the Chief Minister. Okay, Kashi. Overrule the government. You'll get Rs.600 millions by tomorrow. Then consider yourself.. ..the prime minister of Mumbai, Don Zafar. Everyone in the government will consist of our people. The government will be ours and the rule will be yours. (Laughs) Hey, Munna! Hey, Badri! Didn't I tell you? I'll fix. I'll break. I'll fight and make others fight too. I'll make the parties and break them too. But one day, I'll definitely sit on this chair. (Laughs) That day has arrived, Munna. Now, I'm the king of this state. And the rest all are subjects. (Laughs) Listen, Brothers. All you ministers, MLAs.. ..and officers. Honesty, that is ho..nes..ty.. ..is a thing of the past with your past Chief Minister. Understood? Now, whatever I say will be considered an order. Whatever I decide will be the law. Sir.. Tell me, Bhonsle.. ..have you brought my transfer orders from the Home Minister's office? How did you know, sir? I knew.. as soon as the new government is in rule.. ..the ministers have an old habit of transferring officers. Bhonsle, explain to these ministers. Only areas can be changed by transfers.. ..not determination. Tanaji, you take care of yourself and keep writing letters to me. So, you have also received the news of my transfer. What's there to worry about? These sort of things do happen. But sir, people who changed the government in 13 hours.. ..and transferred you in three hours.. ..how can soldiers like us who are only paid.. ..Rs.10000-12000 fight against them? Avasthi, by putting a price tag on this uniform.. ..don't insult all our country's honest officers. Avasthi, terrorists fight for money. But a soldier does not. Soldiers only fight for the dignity and safety of their country. Sorry, sir. Son, they can put someone else in my place. But they can't change our thoughts and our rights. Sir, from now onwards, your thoughts will be our duty. The fire in your heart is now burning within our hearts. Sir, the dream you had of a crime-free state.. ..we'll fulfill that dream now. This will be our gift to our mentor. I have spent Rs.600 millions to break and make the government. And for that, not just 60, not just 600.. ..but I'll torture 3600 million citizens of Mumbai.. ..to repay that amount. From builders to actors.. ..and from doctors to producers, don't spare anyone. Tell them. If they want to live, they need to pay protection money. If they want their families to be safe.. ..then they should send money to Zafar. If anyone wants to do business in Mumbai.. ..even if someone wants to breathe freely in Mumbai.. ..then send Don Zafar his salutation money. Yeda! The police thrashed my men in their own homes. Threaten their homes too. Their mothers, sisters, wife and kids. If anyone disagrees, chop them up. Tell the police force to be afraid of this father of theirs. Of Zafar Supari. (Brakes squeal) Bye. You take care. - You too. Bye. - Bye. Mom. Mom, where are you? (Laughs) (Screams) Brother. Brother! (Screams) Brother! Leave me. Leave me! Don't worry. I'm not here to kill you but to warn you. You know Zafar Supari, don't you? He lives out of country.. ..but rules over all of Mumbai. Inspectors like your brother fall at Zafar Supari's feet. Explain to your brother.. ..that he must respect Zafar like a father.. ..and Yeda like an elder brother. He must salute and fear Zafar every day. Next time I won't come here to explain anything. I'll chop your mother into pieces and kidnap you, too. And anyway, a pretty girl does not belong here.. ..but in Don Zafar's harem and with me. (Brakes squeal) Who was here? Rakhi. Who was here, Rakhi? Tell me. Please. Yes, tell me. - Yeda! One of Zafar Supari's men. (Bullet clinks) (Bullet clinks) (Bullet clinks) So tell me, Chopra. How would you like to have a bullet? With whiskey? With soda? With water? No, Don. - Or.. ..direct! - No, Don Yeda. Forgive me. Forgive you? Under that commissioner's approval, you all were flying very high. No, Don Yeda. I.. I.. I.. Come on. I want Rs.30 millions in cash.. ..the overseas rights of your new film.. ..and the contract for its home video and music. Come on, go. I'll get it. I'll get it right now, Don. What did you say? You'll chop our mothers into pieces? Kidnap our sisters? No, Hyder. So, Zafar Supari's pimp. Come on. Now spread your terror in the city. Now threaten the police force. No, Arjun. So Yeda, now tell me.. ..how would you like to have a bullet? With water? (Coughs and splutter) With soda? (Coughs and splutter) With whiskey? Speak! (Coughs and splutter) Or.. No. - Direct? No. (Gunshot) (Phone rings) (Phone rings) (Phone rings) Chote, it's Yeda's call. - (Phone rings) Yes, Yeda. Tell me. - Don, they've killed Yeda. What? (Over phone) What rubbish? It's not rubbish. It's the truth, Zafar Supari. Who are you? - MPS.. MPS? - Yes. Maharashtra Police Service. Zafar Supari, here's a word of advice. Don't send a band of eunuchs to take on real men again. Remember Zafar, for goons like you.. ..there's no competition in this world, but the police. Zafar Supari, your final warning. For you, there will be no charge sheet.. ..only D-final, which means only death final. Jai Hind! Brother. Hey, Rakhi. Both of you at the police station together? Tell me, who's here to complain about whom? First of all, you write down my complaint, sir. This sister of yours keeps threatening me all the time. If you don't do this, I'll get you arrested. If you don't do that, I'll get you handcuffed. She's doing nothing wrong. (Laughs) Look, Brother.. ..the government is granting him a scholarship.. ..for higher studies abroad.. ..and this gentleman here refuses to leave. Brother, it's not even been three weeks since our engagement.. ..and she wants to exile me to Canada for three years. No, Brother. I don't want to go. If I were in your place, I would've left.. ..the very next day after the engagement. - Brother. It's a lifetime opportunity. Don't miss it. You've already got her. Now don't leave that. And as far as your fiancée is concerned.. ..I'm Arjun Ranawat. Don't worry. (Laughs) - (Phone rings) Hello. - (Over phone) You traitor. (Over phone) Under your reign, that inspector, Arjun Ranawat.. (Over phone) ..tortured Yeda and my men to death, like dogs.. (Over phone) ..while you're laying eggs on your CM's chair. (Over phone) Warming the seat, is that all? No, Don. The thing is.. - Don't interrupt me. If you don't take care of those policemen soon.. ..then I'll take care of your entire family. But Don, I was.. You wretch. If I can make a government with Rs.600 millions.. ..I can even blow your head off with a bullet worth Rs.60.. ..and wipe out you and your entire family. What's the matter, Mr. Kashi? Who was it? It was my boss. Zafar Supari. You idiot, Yashwant Deshpande.. ..I brought you all the way from Pune.. ..and made you the police commissioner here. For what? To dance in your father's procession? You didn't do me a favor. I paid you Rs.25 millions for the post of the Police Commissioner of Mumbai. There. Did you hear that, Kulkarni? He's crying for his 25 millions rupees. Explain to your father. Those encounter specialists killed Zafar's men. Were you sleeping? Now go and dismiss this Encounter Squad. I don't want to see this Encounter Squad again. Do you understand? That's not in my power, Mr. Kashi. Then what's in your power? The sage's bell? Am I the Home Minister of this country? I told you that it's not in my power. Even the DG(Director General) and the Central Home Ministry are involved in this. We'll gain nothing out of anxiety. Whatever we do, we must be careful with it. Mr. Kashi, first decide what to do with Arjun Ranawat.. ..and even before that, decide what to do with Hyder Ali. Hyder is Arjun's eyes and ears. He handles his entire spy network. If you eliminate Hyder.. ..you can be sure you've broken Arjun's backbone. You are right. Mr. Kashi, I'll take care of Hyder. I'll make an issue of his religion.. ..and try for his transfer. I don't want mere effort. Make sure he's transferred and make it quick. (Music) Thank you. Mr. Arjun. Wait a minute. - Yes. I know that you are the strong and silent sort.. ..who don't express their feelings. But what will you do with your eyes? What are you saying? I mean to say that I can clearly make out.. ..from your eyes that you love me a lot. Anything else? Okay, then tell me. Should the ring be worn.. ..on the finger or around the neck? On the nose. Stop joking. Please tell me. On the finger. Then hold my hand and put this ring on my finger.. ..and make me your companion. Companion? - Yes. First don't make me suffer so much. - What? I'll put the ring on later, but first put this on. Jannat, beauty is adored when it's covered up.

You are being transferred from the job because of your caste. Hand over your charge to ACP Arjun Ranawat. But why, sir? The special investigation team is on.. ..an operation to investigate the Mumbai underworld's links.. ..with the ISI and are exposing some of the ISI agents here. It is their opinion that.. ..in this operation, some of our officers.. ..may be gentle to the alleged ISI agents. Why don't you say it clearly, sir? That I'm being transferred.. ..because I'm a Muslim.. ..and hence could be helping the Muslim criminals? Look at this. Can you see these bullet marks? These are marks from bullets fired by Muslim terrorists. The bullets coming out of my gun.. ..don't ask a criminal his caste or religion. Whether he is a Hindu or a Muslim. Through this report, you want to convey.. ..that my caste, my religion is a proof.. ..of me being a traitor. - Hyder. No, Arjun. Even if I cut off my head and give it to them.. ..even then this department.. ..would not believe that Hyder is an honest.. ..and patriotic police officer. No, I don't care. - No. Hyder don't do it. Ali don't do it. I don't want to do this job, Arjun. Commissioner, Hyder Ali is such a Muslim.. ..who can sacrifice his life for his country.. ..and his land even without this uniform. This is a mistake on your part, sir. The traitors have no caste or religion. They are neither Hindu nor Muslim. The mere fact that I'm a Rajput, or that you're a Brahmin.. ..is not proof of us being patriots. Such a cheap criminal thought takes several youths like Hyder Ali.. ..to wrong directions, distancing them from our country. Why don't you understand? These decisions are not taken here. They are taken in the offices of the Home Ministry and.. ..DGP (Director General of Police). If you have the guts.. ..go there and tell them what you just told me. (Brakes squeal) Shut up. You mean that he, who took his belt off.. ..and walked out abusing the police department in front of a commissioner.. ..that ill-mannered junior of yours is correct? That we are all non-secular? Communal? Is that what you want to say? If your seniors call you and tell you that you are a Sikh.. ..and that you'd be aiding the Khalistani terrorists.. ..and are therefore being transferred from Punjab.. ..then you'd have not liked it either. Sir, if you were not stopped from fighting Sikh terrorists.. ..why is Hyder Ali Khan being stopped from fighting.. ..Muslim terrorists and ISI agents? Without any proof or witness.. ..just on the grounds of religion.. ..to suspect somebody is unconstitutional. Sir.. ..our constitution gives prominence to duty. Best man for the job. It does not give prominence to religion. Sir.. ..Hyder Ali Khan is such a soldier.. ..who would like his uniform to be adorned a million times.. ..but would never let it be tarnished even once. They have proven me a traitor. Now, they'll knock me off in an encounter any day. What is this? My arrest warrant? Or is it a search warrant against a traitor? No. These are orders to have two more pegs. But have it with joy. - What do you mean? Read it and you'll know. Your transfer order has been cancelled. You did this for me? No, for myself. Because the police department needs officers like you.. ..and I need a friend like you. - Is that so? Then you must also do something for me. Just ask. - Then listen. A daughter-in-law like Jannat for mother.. ..a sister-in-law like Jannat for me and Rakhi.. ..and Jannat as your wife is what we all need. Cheers. - Cheers. (Music) "I'll hide you in my eyes in such a way" "I'll hide you in my eyes in such a way" "However you try to escape, I'll steal you away" "In your love my dear" "In your love my dear, I'll forget the world" "However you try to escape, I'll steal you away" (Music) "The vermillion on my forehead tells it" "The bangles on my hands tell it" "The anklets on my feet tell it.

My fortunes have opened up. May you live long. Dear, this is a special gift. Rakhi had it made, so as to give it to her sister-in-law.. ..when she first enters this house. Hold this, dear. May you live long, dear. May your hands always be around to protect and bless me, Mother. Hold this, Mother. Let me show you the house, Sister-in-law. Go along, dear. She is good. You sit down. I'll arrange for some food. (Laughs) Hey, Deshpande.. ..you're as nervous as a 16 year old on his first date. Listen, I'm the Deputy Chief Minister. And when the elder brother is the CM.. ..what damage can the report.. ..being prepared by ACP Arjun Ranawat do to us? Don't you read the newspapers? If not, start reading them. Because of the leak in the Jaiswal report.. ..a DGP, a commissioner and.. ..a dozen officers are rotting in custody. Their bells have been rung, understood? Listen, Mr. Kashi. Arjun is digging into our nexus with the underworld. If he succeeds in establishing that nexus.. ..it would dig a grave for us and the underworld. Try and get that report at any cost, Mr. Kashi. If that report goes to Delhi.. ..all of us will be behind bars. And if.. - (Shushing) Badri. - Yes! Those forged documents that are being printed in our press.. ..should be given to me tomorrow. - Yes, Brother. And yes.. ..regarding that report by Arjun Ranawat.. ..that report will be on the table of.. ..Chief Minister Kashinath Trivedi tomorrow morning. (Laughs) Did you remember something, ACP Arjun Ranawat? I told you that one day, I'll occupy this chair. (Laughs) And that you'll salute me. Do you remember? You're mistaken, Kashi Trivedi. I've saluted this constitutional position.. ..and not you. Those who sit on this chair keep coming and going. Stay within your limit. From today, I'm your master and you're my servant. I'm a public servant and not yours. I'm a public servant. And so are you. Tell me. What did you call me for? Then listen. I've kept the home ministry with myself. That's why I gave this order. The data bank on the Mumbai mafia that you have compiled.. ..give it to me. I knew it.. ..that you'd want the information on those.. ..who helped you reach here. Take it. Keep it safe. (Laughs) Confidential.. (Laughs) So, this is the real deal. You must have worked very hard to compile this. But.. (Laughs) Saw how I burnt it to ashes in a moment? You must be feeling heartbroken, right? No. Yours will hurt. Maybe, you'll even have a heart attack. Because one copy of this has been sent.. ..to the Central Home Ministry.. ..the second to the President's office.. ..and the third to the Prime Minister's office. Your mafia friends can't escape now. You're a scalper for Zafar Supari. What did you say? You called me a scalper? Me. You called Kashi a scalper? You called the CM a scalper? You small-time police officer, what's your status? What do you think you are? Kashi Trivedi, when the bones break at this age.. ..they're set back with great difficulty. Take your hands off me. Now I'll show you your status. You beat up the CM! You beat the CM! No, a patriotic and honest public servant.. ..has beaten up a treacherous and dishonest public servant. Kashi Trivedi, my name is Arjun Ranawat. To me, death is like a pillow and a coffin is like a bed. Jai Hind! Yes, 555. What is the news? Who? Arjun sir? No, I'm Hyder speaking. Tell me. Sir, the minor girls brought in for prostitution.. ..from different parts of the country.. ..have been hidden in the old Jassai railway yard. And they'll be sent to different brothels in Mumbai tonight. Please save them, sir. Don't worry. We'll go there and save them all. Please don't kill me, sir. Leave me. (Gunshot) (Brakes squeal) (Gun cocks) There's nobody here. Was the news given by 555 false? Sir, could this be a trap? - Yes. This is a trap. A trap for all of you to die. Zafar Supari, you? Yes, it's me. I'm in India. Look around you. Encounter Specialist, I'll do the encounters today. Yours, your friend Arjun Ranawat's.. ..and of all of Mumbai. See, I've brought 500 tonnes of RDX. Turn around and see. It's good that you have brought.. ..your own funeral pyre materials to burn yourself. Instead of you burning the city of Mumbai.. ..I, Hyder Ali Khan, will burn you. (Gunshot) (Rapid gunfire) We're trapped, sir. Five of our colleagues are dead. We have no option, but to retreat. This is not the time to retreat, friends. This is the time to pay back our debt to this uniform we wear. Today, all of us will pay back that debt. How much ammunition are we left with? Last magazine, sir. Friends, our prime target is destruction of.. ..the RDX brought by Zafar Supari. I'm moving towards that direction. You both will cover me. Any doubts? - No, sir. (Gunshot) (Empty gun clicks) No! Oh, God. (Explosion) Hyder! Zafar Supari, you'd set out to burn all of Mumbai, right? Look. Hyder Ali Khan will burn you up.. ..in the same burning RDX pile you brought here. (Gun cocks) (Gunshot) Avasthi? You? Traitor! - Yes. Hyder Ali! (Gunshot) (Empty gun clicks) (Phone rings) Hello. - Yes, MPS. Maharashtra Police Services. Go to old Jassai railway yard.. ..where the corpses of your brother, Haider.. ..and other colleagues of yours are waiting for you. (Cellphone beeps) (Explosion) Ashok. Hyder. Deepak. Hyder. Yashwant Rao. Hyder. Hyder. Hyder. "The uniform is our pride." "The uniform is our faith." "The uniform is our identity." "The uniform is our God." Hyder. "I've sacrificed this life for my country." "We are proud of our country" I'm very sorry to inform the press that.. ..Hyder Ali Khan, the bravest officer of the Crime Control Squad.. ..was a secret agent operating.. ..for the underworld and Pakistan Secret Service, ISI. Pakistan and the underworld together.. ..had planned for another serial bomb explosion in Mumbai. Inspector Hyder Ali was helping them.. ..bring 500 tonnes of RDX into Mumbai. Yesterday, Inspector Avasthi reached the spot.. ..and destroyed the dangerous mission. Not only did Avasthi destroy the RDX, but also killed.. ..the traitor Hyder Ali Khan and his accomplices. During our raids at Hyder Ali's residence.. ..we found some floppies, foreign bank accounts.. ..forged passports and visas.. ..and some ISI identity cards. - (Camera clicks) These are proof of his having been a Pakistani agent. (Phone rings) (Phone rings) Zafar Supari. 'What am I doing?' 'I had vowed not to discuss that incident with anybody.' 'But today, I've broken my vow.' 'No.' Tyagi. What is this man saying? Samar Singh has resigned from his police job.. ..and is going to fight Ranawat's case? He has filed a lawsuit in court. (Chuckles) What is so alarming in that, Mr. Kashi? Everybody knows that Samar Singh is also a lawyer. But he is also an emotional lawyer. But I am a professional lawyer.. ..experienced in proving true as false and false as true. Let it be. - But we should be.. Mr. Kashi. The false evidence that we have and.. ..the charge sheet I've prepared is so strong and foolproof.. ..that let alone Samar Singh.. ..even God can't save Arjun Ranawat from death penalty. The game is over. Your Honor, I would like to present the officers.. ..who have been working with Arjun Ranawat for the past 15 years. These witnesses will tell us.. ..who Arjun Ranawat is and what his character is like.. ..and what the truth is. Permission granted. Your Honor, this is that Arjun Ranawat.. ..who is considered the lion of Mumbai. The mafia gangs would shiver in their boots on hearing his name. Sir, he's that Arjun Ranawat because of whom.. ..the underworld was not only forced.. ..to leave the city, but the country too. Your Honor.. ..if the police force.. ..didn't have officers like Arjun and Hyder Ali.. ..then these mafias would have made the police their pimps.. ..and Mumbai their brothel. But this is the misfortune of this country.. ..that one was killed by humiliation while performing his duties.. ..and the other.. ..is standing in this witness box. I would like to call Arjun Ranawat's mother.. ..Shakuntla Devi to the witness box. Permission granted. Mrs. Shakuntla Devi, when court.. ..will declare your son to be a traitor and sentence him to death.. ..won't you be ashamed of being his mother? Won't you regret it? Regret? I'll regret that I didn't bear him. I'll regret that every mother of this country.. ..didn't give birth to a son like Arjun. Not regret, but I'll be proud of Arjun's death. The same pride which 'Bhagat Singh's' (Indian freedom fighter).. ..mother felt on the day of Bhagat Singh's execution. Every countryman would have felt it. Your Honor, not just in this life, but in every life.. ..I would like to live and die as Arjun's mother. (Clapping) Wow! What a speech! Astonishing! Incredible! But I would like to remind the court.. ..that this case is a mass murder case. And the criminal has already admitted his crime. And Your Honor, I also want my friend to know.. ..that cases are fought with evidence and witnesses.. ..not with speeches and dramatics. Also, Your Honor.. ..when his mother has already compared him to Bhagat Singh.. ..then to spare that great martyr's name.. ..I'm left with no other choice, but to unveil a truth.. ..after which every mother and sister.. ..of this world would like to die in shame. And this mother.. (Chuckles) ..she'll be left utterly speechless. Okay, Mrs. Shakuntla Devi. Tell the court.. ..on the night of 1st of November.. ..where was your daughter Rakhi Dixit? Answer me, Shakuntla Devi. Where was your daughter and his so-called sister.. ..on the night of the mass murder? Answer me. Where was she? You tell me, Arjun Ranawat.. ..on the night of the 1st of November.. ..where was your so-called sister, Rakhi Dixit? Answer me, Arjun Ranawat. Why are you so quiet? You can't answer this question and nor can your mother. I'll answer this question. Your Honor, on the night of the 1st of November.. ..his sister, a girl of loose character.. ..an aimless and uncultured woman.. - I object, Your Honor. ..was at the chief minister's farmhouse.. ..making merry with the Deputy CM, Munna Trivedi.. ..police commissioner's son and many other people, Your Honor. I object, Your Honor. She was a high society call girl, Your Honor. She didn't just have illegitimate relations with many men.. ..but also with her so-called brother, Arjun Ranawat. She was his sister during the day and his mistress at night. His mistress. Tyagi! Arjun! Don't Arjun! (Groans) What's this? He's started with hooliganism. Somebody stop him. Guards, security. Catch him. Guards! Catch him. Hold him. Arjun! No, son. No, son. Arjun! Arjun! I say, no. Leave him. Swear by me. (Groans) (Coughs) Did you see that, Your Honor? He doesn't know of any other way to stifle the truth. He can't tolerate any other man.. ..in a relationship with Rakhi. (Coughs) On the night of 1st November.. ..when he found his 'mistress-sister' with not one, but three men in bed.. ..he lost control in just this way. And that's why, he committed that mass murder. Tyagi! (Gavel Bangs) Order! Order! I say, stop it! Samar Singh, one more inappropriate action like this from your client.. ..will force me to stop this proceeding right here.. ..and come to a conclusion. Sorry, Your Honor. Today's proceeding is stopped here. Tomorrow's proceeding will be held in the presence.. ..of paramilitary forces.. ..and only the people who are concerned with this case. Shameless. Rotten scoundrel. If I wasn't bound by the boundaries of the law today.. ..I would have shot that Tyagi. By presenting Rakhi in court tomorrow.. ..I'll clear all the lies Tyagi has been spewing. But Rakhi cannot come to court. Why? Why can't she come? She'll have to come to court tomorrow. But sir, she is in deep shock due to Arjun's killings. Since she's got the news, she just won't react to anyone. She is being treated at the St. Mary's sanitarium in Khandala. 'There is definitely some secret that Arjun is hiding from me.' Don't sit like a rock. Tell me, Rakhi. What was the reason behind that mass slaughter? One of your brothers, Hyder Ali, has died a humiliating death. And the other one is charged with treason. Will you be able to bear that.. ..your brother Arjun is sentenced to death? No. Will you able to live after hearing that.. ..your brother is a despicable and disgraceful person? You stone-hearted woman.. ..will you be able to bear people saying that.. ..you had an indecent relationship with your brother? Will you be able to listen to the taunt that you are Arjun's mistress? No! (Screams) (Thunder crashing) Tell me clearly, dear, what the truth is. Perhaps, I'll be able to save Arjun's life. Tell me what the truth is. I'll tell you, Uncle. I'll tell you the truth. (Crying) Your Honor, these are some documents.. ..that I'm going to give to the.. ..Chief Minister and Police Commissioner. Please watch carefully. So Chief Minister, what do you have in your hand? They are the pamphlets of my election propaganda. And this is my newspaper, 'Mera Bharat Mahan.' Can you tell us where they are printed? At my own printing press in Nagpur. - Good. So, Police Commissioner. What do you have in your hand? This? They are the documents from Pakistan which mention.. ..that Hyder and Arjun Ranawat are ISI agents. Pakistan's government's documents. According to the reports given by laboratory experts.. ..the ink used in printing these documents from Pakistan.. ..is the same as the ink used in Chief Minister's newspaper.. ..'Mera Bharat Mahan.' Now, there can only be two things, Your Honor. Either Chief Minister's newspaper 'Mera Bharat Mahan'.. ..is printed in Pakistan. Or documents from Pakistan.. ..are printed in his own printing press.. ..which is in Maharashtra, India. Your Honor, these two great people.. ..forgot this small point. And to prove Arjun and Hyder to be traitors.. ..they printed these fake documents of Pakistan.. ..in their own printing press. Arrest them. Your Honor, he's misleading the court. Because this case isn't a case of forgery, but of murder. And no one can change the truth that.. ..the accused has killed 18 people. Does his lawyer have any evidence.. ..which will prove that this murder wasn't a crime? I have that evidence, Your Honor. Then present that evidence and prove Arjun innocent. Why are you so silent? Show us the evidence. I have the evidence, but I can't present it in court. Do you know that this statement may also.. ..result in the guilty being awarded death penalty? Yes, sir. Sentence Arjun to death. I'm asking you for the last time.. ..what was the reason for the murder? Answer me, Mr. Samar Singh. Sentence him to death. I can't tell the reason. Your Honor. Your Honor, I'll tell you the reason. No, Rakhi! You go back. I'm telling you. Go back, Rakhi. Swear on me, Rakhi. Go back. For mother's sake, Rakhi, back off from this hell. No, Brother. Neither any promise, nor God can stop me today.. ..from telling the truth about our relationship. Don't get emotional, Rakhi. You'll be ruined. Let me be ruined. Today, I'll tell what the truth is. Your Honor, on the night of the 1st of November.. ..the brother of this CM, Deputy CM Badrinath Trivedi.. ..underworld don Zafar Supari, Inspector Avasthi.. ..this commissioner's son and his men.. ..kidnapped me and took me to their farmhouse. Your Honor, to rape me. To gang rape me. No, please. Brother! - Come here. Leave me. Brother! - Come on, Inspector. Brother! - Good. - Save me, Brother. Leave me. No! No! Brother! Come on. Come. - No. Save me. No! - Save me, Brother. Brother! Brother! No! No! (Laughs) (Phone rings) (Phone rings) Encounter Specialist, Arjun Ranawat. I'm Zafar Supari. If you have the guts.. ..then come to the CM's farmhouse.. ..and stop your sister from being raped. Zafar Supari. (Tires squealing) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Glass shatters) (Grunts) (Grunts) (Grunts) (Glass shatters) (Screams) (Rakhi crying) Brother! Brother! Arjun! (Sobbing) This is the truth of that night. Now does anyone want to know why my brother has kept his silence.. ..and wished for a death penalty? Just wait, Your Honor. Your Honor, I'm a soldier. I don't want a life of mercy. My only wish is either victory or martyrdom. Give me death penalty. Because I'll come back again. And to save the pride of my country.. ..I'll pick up weapons again. Because Arjun had always taken up weapons on the battleground.. ..in the past, the present and the future. This court hereby orders a case to be filed.. ..against the Chief Minister, Kashinath Trivedi.. ..and Commissioner Deshpande on counts of treason. And with that, the one who took up arms for the safety of the society.. ..Arjun Ranawat is declared.. ..free from all charges leveled against him. Long live Arjun Ranawat! Long live Arjun Ranawat! Long live Arjun Ranawat! Long live Arjun Ranawat! "In the holy book of Gita Lord Krishna said.." "..to kill evil is not a sin." "In the holy book of Gita Lord Krishna said.."
