THE GOOD LIFE This is Jorge Robson. Please leave a message. Jorge, this is Teresa. Please call me back. You must not have sex for at least two months. And pray that the symptoms don't come back. They may seem to have gone, but the virus is still there. The moment the defences are down it will return. Lights, please. Girls, I just ask you to listen, please, we're finishing so have a little patience. The risk is not just... just a little longer, please, we've nearly finished. The risk is not just about AIDS. It is so easy... thank you... one condom can protect you. I don't think you know what being on the street really means. - What's your name? - Rita López. You really have no idea what our customers are like. - But they are men, right? - Yes, most of them. But some are animals. I'm not here to tell you how to do your job. I just want to tell you it can be done just as well with a condom. It's that simple. How long did it take... one second? Yes, but the problem is doing it for real. I've often been asked to put it on with my mouth. Why don't you show us? Yes! Show us! Show us! Show us! Any more questions? - Name? - Edmundo Tapia. Mr. Tapia... You're nearly at your credit limit. How much do you want? - Three thousand more. - Three thousand. You have late payments of five hundred dollars. Who doesn't have late payments in this country? I'm optimistic about my future. That's good. Let me see... You're a hairdresser... I'm also a stylist. Now I'm working with a new holistic concept. Holistic concept? Yes. - And the loan is for equipment? - No, it's for a car. A car? - Can you guarantee the loan? - With what? - An asset? A house? - Not at the moment. - Someone in your family... your father? - He's dead. I'm sorry. It's OK. He died a long time ago. Without a guarantee, I doubt you'll get loan approval. It's not up to me. My mother owns an apartment. That's it! You kept that well hidden! Bring the title deeds... and your mother must come to sign the guarantee. Difficult. You see, she's infirm. How about... if you ask her for a photocopy of her ID, and get her to sign here. This is just between us, right? Thank you so much. I have a question. This holistic concept... could it work for me? Definitely. In the right hands... - Edmundo! - Not now, Pablo. Later. - How can you be so late, man! - Hi, Douglas. - Hi, Eva. - Hi, handsome. We're waiting. Should I start now? Of course. It's taking for ever. I'm starting now. Is that mine? Mine is meat and cheese. Agustín. Agustín. Quiet! Enough, sir. Thank you very much. For God's sake, stop! Thank you. We'll have a 30 minute lunch break. Madam, gents, gather around, please. On behalf of the jury I want to congratulate everybody on their work. Unfortunately, we only have a few vacancies. Good luck. CLARINET WAITING LIST Cortés Melillanca, Mario If you keep looking, I'm going to take forever. What would you do if you were me? What? I can't discuss the jury's decision. I know I'm the best. My post has been given to some niece, nephew, son, lover... I need the job. Once it used to gush... I have a conductor friend. He may be able to help you. Have you got a pen? Yes. Just a sec. Come in. In my office in an hour? Listen, Raúl, why do our condoms tear so easily? Do they? - I didn't know they did. - I'm telling you. They aren't intended for unusual practices. OK, fine, next year we'll change our supplier. That simple? Look, look, look for yourself. Why do you take it so personal? Because it is personal. If it's personal, we can talk about it later, but not in my office. No, that's over. - It is? - Yes. What a modern woman. One night, and you're an expert on me. In an hour, in my office. OK. Doctor, I need to talk to you. I told you to admit yourself to a hospital. But what can I do with my son? We offer full coverage, but we don't have children's daycare. Talk to my secretary to see when you can admit yourself. Okay? - Hello, darling. - Hi. He's a handsome boy. What's his name? Rivera, I think. I hardly know him. Wouldn't you like to get to know him better? Why? I don't know... for fun. Would you like to go out? Go out? Maybe go to the cinema? - The two of us? - Yes, us. I can't. I have homework. You missed your chance. Hello... where is the demo? Downstairs. Hello. Hello. - Do you want something to drink? - Sure. - Oh, sorry. - Sorry. Hello. Let me show you the latest facial masks. - Just a minute and... - I'm meeting a friend... - Just a minute. - Later. The effects last longer... not just the usual two months. These lines here... just here on the forehead... - make you look older. - You don't want to have a bad-tempered look, do you? This treatment is totally painless. There we are. The swelling lasts only while it penetrates the skin. Soon she'll look like a teenager. Now we need a volunteer. Anybody? Esmeralda! No, not now. I'd rather look. - Anybody else? - Me. Mari? That's right, Mari. Always good discounts for you! Ask Eva upstairs. It's an integral beauty concept because polymers are the future. Surgery is not the only way. - Really? - Yes. Take your face, for instance. You look at yourself in the mirror one morning and you think: these lips need enhancing. What's wrong with my lips? Nothing. I'm talking hypothetically. Sure. Go on. - Your breasts... - What's wrong with my breasts? Nothing, but... If I can just... You may want to have them lifted. See how it brings out your bodyline? - You think so? - Of course. Well, in that case, surgery is necessary. You have a little spot there. What? Do you think you could stop that noise? This dadadada... it's driving me crazy. Everyone's making a noise. But yours gets into my skull. - I'll try playing some pieces... - That's even worse. Play something less depressing. - It's my job. - Look. I don't care if they pay you to make that noise, but not when I'm at home. Thank you. What a nice car! My mother always said I should go into banking. - Really? - I have an uncle who is a banker. - Is that right? He won't help? - It's a long story. We have plenty of time. - Happy hour? - Happy hour! - I know a place around here. - Let's go. Hey... how did your father die? - Are you allowed to be with customers? - This is business. - He was crushed by a bus. - Really? Which was good and bad. Bad because he was a nice man, good because the bus company pays my mother a pension. Don't worry. Yes, I saw the deposit. Thanks. Listen Jorge, I wanted to talk to you... but in person. - Tomorrow? - Of course. What time's good for you? Want to talk to your dad? Sure? Teresa, are you there? Yes, I'm here. I'll meet you at The Sport at noon. Ah! The Sport. OK. - Bye. - OK. Bye. - Do you need anything, love? - No. Is it your homework? It's a novel. A novel? What's it about? It's not about anything. How could it not be a story? It's just like life. I hadn't thought of it that way. - Watch out with 'Riding Hood'! - 'Riding Hood'? Little Red Riding Hood! They're building next door to you? - They're planning a Mall. - That's good. Yes. - Where's the bathroom? - Down there, at the end. - Hallo. - Christ! Esmeralda? - Mum! - Edmundo, what a lovely girl! I thought you were going out! I called you and there was no reply. Who is he? Don't you recognize him? It's Rebecca's husband, Héctor, from the fourth floor. He's just out of hospital. They had nobody to leave him with. I made him some soup and he fell asleep, the poor thing. - Hold on, hold on. - What? You still live with your mother? She's old... and someone has to look after her. I have to go. - Why? - I have to. - But why? - Your mother! What does she have to do with it? She's family. Remember to bring me the papers and the photocopies. Sure. If you're still interested. Are you sure there's no other way to do it? I'm sure. The car keys? What car? Little Red Riding Hood... - Sure. Bye. - Bye. Oh darling, you're not leaving so soon! Yes, ma'am, I have to get up early tomorrow morning. - Bye. - Goodbye, Esmeralda. - Come back soon. - Thank you. Bye. What papers? Mum, please let me know next time you're entertaining your refugees, - so I can go to a motel. - You're so heartless. What papers? Nothing... It's for a loan. What do you want now? Well, it's something... that is very important for me. What is it? - A car. - A car? Yes, a Ford Fiesta. A Ford? What do you need a Ford for? It's a birthday present. - Who for? - For me. I was 40 two weeks ago, if you recall. What nonsense! All that money... You know what your father would have said? Sure. Tell me. - He would have forbidden it. - Are you sure? Of course! He cared for important things, the family, the country... not stupid things... A Ford! Would you like some more soup? So? Are you going to help me or not, mum? I just need your signature. Your own flesh and blood, mother. Bring me two estimates and I'll think about it. So, you're originally from Mulchen. Nice area. The auditions are over and those selected are starting. But you were three years in Berlin, and, more importantly, the conductor of the Philharmonic recommends you. Our doors are always open to talented people. Thank you. - Any questions? - Yes. Is the salary before or after tax? Are you here for the money? In part, sir. I hope the other part is to serve your country. That's our mission. Don't make fools of us. Dismissed. Yes, sir. Cortés. The salary is before tax. - How are you doing? - Good. And you? Fine, thanks. - You look well. - Thank you. - I ordered you a Bloody Mary. - Perfect. So... what brings you here? - Perhaps something to do with Paula? - Yes. Our little Paula, I'm very worried about her. She doesn't have any friends, she doesn't go out... She hides away, writing a novel. At 15, can you imagine? A novel... with no story. She hardly speaks to me. I can't handle it on my own. I know it's hard for you as well, to talk to her, but... I have talked to her. - Have you? - Yes. Paula is pregnant. Our Paula? Yes. Did she tell you? Yes. When? Today, this morning. My 15-year-old is pregnant and I'm the last one to know! And she tells you! Tells you! What am I? A ghost? Invisible? - Teresa, please... - Don't Teresa me! It's probably easier to talk to me. Of course, how silly of me, to talk to a father who never sees her... Who's feckless and can't find a job... who walks through life as if nothing is happening. There must be a reason why she told me. Ask her. Whenever I see that face of yours I remember why I got divorced. My poor girl! My poor girl! We have to do something... here in Chile or abroad. Something. Leave it with me. Of course, I'll pay my share. CEMETERY OF SANTIAGO Stop pushing! Come on, fellas, give her a chance. Don't touch me, I can manage. Take it easy. Mrs. Leonor Cisternas: the rights over Edmundo Tapia Orellana's grave, acquired on 13 December 1972, have expired. You will need to come to this office to regularize matters. Hallo. Lucas Zambrano. Mario Cortés. - How did you do in the audition? - I didn't audition. - Do you know someone here? - No. - Are you in? - I'm in. - Congratulations! - Thanks. I've been accepted as well. Great. This was my last chance. This was my third audition. But I've got in! Good. What about you? Are you happy? It's not the music I usually play. I studied at Berlin. - I studied there for three years. - Did you? I'm going to join the Philharmonic. Big league, eh? Can I sit next to you? Of course. Right. I hope it's true girls like men in uniform. - What's your instrument? - Clarinet. I've got my own. - Next. - Clarinet, sir. HERE LIES A MASTER HAIRDRESSER, FATHER AND LOVING HUSBAND WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU. YOUR WIFE AND SON - Hallo. - Hallo. Can I have a cigarette? José, can you give him one? Okay. - Visiting somebody? - Yes, my dad. Right. You seem in a hurry. We're paid per grave. - Thanks. - Bye. We can upgrade your father's grave. We have a special offer. The higher ones are cheaper, unlike apartments. He wouldn't care about the view. I want the cheapest one. The cheapest one... with a 10-year lease... including recovery of the grave, second row, and basic sealing, would be US$ 1,378 plus taxes. We offer credit facilities. How much? US$ 1,378 plus taxes. US$ 1,378 plus taxes! It's a joke, right? No. US$ 1,378 plus taxes! What if I don't have the money? Some banks give loans. What if I don't want to pay? This is a public cemetery. We don't deny anyone the dignity of burial, but, unfortunately, people keep dying. We have to renew the cemetery. We cremate the remains and leave them in a common cinerary for free. If you want, you can have a commemorative plate for US$ 75... - Plus taxes. - Exactly. Then burn him and I'll keep the ashes. I'd like to help you, but the remains are cremated along with others. Which would make that impossible. An individual cremation... would be US$ 780, plus taxes. That includes... Sir! I shall proceed to remove the coffin. Do whatever you want. Almost brand new. 70,000 miles, 2001, only one owner. US$ 4,000, but I'll let it go for US$ 3,000. - I've got US$ 1,500. - No, not enough. I don't have more. Just between us, the old man is fucked. I think he'll take that, but right away. How long could you wait for me? No more than two days. - Hello. - What are you having? A beer. And one for you? No, I don't drink. - Sure! - No, really. - Anything else? - A mineral water for me. Make it two beers, anyway. - Coming up. - Thanks. Tell me something, man. Like what? I don't know... what's it like in Germany? I don't know Germany. I know Berlin, which is different. Yes, you're right. What about the girls? Those German blondes. They like dark men, don't they? No. No? There are more than enough to go around. I see. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. - Thanks. - Thanks. Are you sure? It's on me. Anyway... - Cheers. - Cheers. May I? Yes. Be careful. It's delicate. It's a Buffet RC. I see! A real beauty, right? Beauty isn't the right word, man. She's hot! Truly hot! But really! Life in Germany was wild! Not really. thanks for seeing us. I know how busy you are. - Sorry I couldn't see you at my office. - No, it's OK. My, you've grown! The last time I saw you, you were a child. She still is. Come, Paula, lie down here. Give it to me. Don't read it. How do you feel? Fine. Have you felt nauseous? No. Any pain? Not that I know. Is your appetite good? Yes. Not so good. She doesn't eat. And your last intercourse, when was it? Answer, love. You don't remember? Teresa, please leave us alone for a while. Ah, sure. - I'll examine her. - All right. Fine. If you need me, I'll be outside. Just call me. I will. Take off your panties so I can examine you. All right. KEEP OUT "THE GOOD LIFE", A NOVEL BY PAULA ROBSON TO MY MUM AND DAD A couple of days and it will be over. Maybe we can have a short holiday, the two of us, in a quiet place. Anywhere you choose. I know this is partly my fault. I'm not giving you enough attention and I'm really sorry, darling. Anyway, you should have told me. Don't you trust me? I even gave you condoms. As a birthday present. So what? I thought it was for the best. Did they tear? - Mum! - Mum what? Was it that boy Rivera from school? Does he know? I'm trying to talk to you. I'm trying to help. But you have to help as well. Let's at least try to be friends. Friends? You're not my friend. You're my mother. Have any bills arrived? Bills? The gas bill. I'll pay it tomorrow. they could cut us off. Take it easy, mum. That's an E, man. Cortés. I'm the conductor here. Zambrano, pay attention. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - OK, once again from number 2. - What time is it? Zambrano! I can't find anything. He has to be there. He was well known. Let's see, wait a minute... Pepe. - Yes? - Could you help us? What's the matter? Do you remember Edmundo Tapia Orellana? Tapia Orellana? Edmundo Tapia Orellana? Of course I remember him! He's probably in the '69 file. Bring it here. - What was your relationship with him? - I'm his son. I didn't know he had children. Come here, sir. - Have a seat. - Thank you. I didn't even know he was married. Your old man was a very nice man. I was explaining that, as my father is going to be reburied... the union might want to have him reburied with honours. - With Chile's great hairdressers. - That would be unusual. There's nothing in our rules about reburials. Yes, but I can't take care of that. Isn't that what unions are for? I'm not asking for a new grave. Mausoleums are for big fish. My dad wasn't just a great hairdresser, he was a hairdressing teacher, too, and more. People loved him because he cut hair for free in the slums. Let me see. UNPAID... UNPAID... UNPAID... Your father was a very nice man. Impossible to forget him. He loved to party. He even partied here. My God, he could tell a story! But a hairdresser for the poor...? No. I've known them all. Your father was none of those things. To be remembered and honoured by his son after he is dead... who can ask for more? That's right. Maestro, how about a coffee? A cappuccino with... Not for me. I know the perfect coffee house to go and celebrate. Celebrate what? You're really having a bad time! Hey, you have to go, or I'll put you in jail. Let's go, or we'll miss our chance. - I'm having my coffee. - Fuck! Let's go! I'm having my coffee. My clarinet! Right. - Hallo! - Hallo! You're here now, so you're not leaving. - Who's going with Nina? - I'll go. No, no, he's going. - No, but... - Go on! - Give me that. I'll take care of it. - No, no. You can't go in with anything strange. No, no, don't worry, he's as good as gold. It's all right, it's all right. It's all right. - Hallo! - Hallo. Come in. Make yourself comfortable. Don't worry. Nothing will happen. I do worry. What? Be careful. Fuck off! - What's going on here? - This girl shouldn't be here. She's not professional. She's driving our costumers away. She's sick! - She's sick. She can't stay here. - Take her away. - That's enough! Calm down! - Come... - Please don't touch me! - Perhaps you can find another spot. - I like it here. - So much for solidarity! - Take her away! Hold on. Hold on. Take it easy. Look... Anything you need... a doctor or anything else... call me. At any time. OK? Jorge! Come in, Edmundo! Look who's here. Esmeralda! - Hallo! - Hallo! Sit down and try these cookies Esmeralda brought. I called her so she could explain this credit thing better. Mum! I'm asking for credit, not you. What did I tell you? See what he's like? Mum, you know I don't like you talking about me. Leonor was telling me about your family. - What chapter are you on? - When she met your father. She was 37, he was a bit younger. He combed her hair so gently... Then he helped her with her coat and didn't charge her. - And then they got married. - Yes. Despite her parents' objections. They didn't like the fact he was lower class. Right, mum? - Where did you get that? - Am I wrong? Your father was a professional, just like my father and uncles. I stand corrected... a pro-fe-ssio-nal. My mother's too modest to tell you that my father was famous. And not only that, he was committed to poor people, poorer than himself. Right, mum? That was a long time ago. We have to look forward, son. Your mother is right. Then why don't you sell this apartment? Give me my inheritance while you're still alive. I've been offered a fortune, but I can't decide. How much is an apartment like this worth? - No idea. - You work with this stuff... - 200 thousand dollars, 250 thousand? - Ah! Edmundo, don't be such a pain. - OK, here's the application. - Thank you. Thanks for the tea. Bye. Esmeralda! Look... I'm sorry about that. I don't mind. - Can I walk you to your car? - I took the bus. - And your car? - No one said it was my car. - Whose car is it then? - A friend's. A friend's...? I gave it back to him, last night. Call me. Right... Hallo? Hallo? Hallo? Who's there? Mario, is that you? How did you know? The international call "pip"... and your silence. How are you? And you? Are you in the Philharmonic? Almost, almost... And you? Good. On tour with the University Orchestra. Why did you call? Well... I wanted to hear your voice. My dearest boy... I'll call you some other time. No, don't be like that... What terrible manners. How dare you laugh at me and your father in front of a stranger? Leave the old man alone, mum. Aren't you interested in the Ford any more? Do you want me to tear this up? Do what you like. Stop hounding him, mum. Thirty years is more then enough. Hounding him? Me? You're the one who's doing that. You are always mocking him. What did he ever do to you to deserve that? He died. - Yes? - Esmeralda? Edmundo? Hi. Come in. Wait! - Is there someone here? - My mum. You live with your mother! That's the kitchen! Edmundo, is that you? Yes, mum. Sleep well. Come in. Excuse me. Mrs. López. Miss. Have a seat. I'm all ears. - I work at Café Turco. - At the Portugal Market. - You know it. - Yes. I'm the cashier and I serve customers too. I'm afraid the girls don't use condoms. Or hardly ever. It's the customers' fault, I think. Perhaps you could help me to persuade them. So you're here about your friends' problems, not your own. Interesting. It's my problem too. It's not fair on those who want to use condoms, is it? Right. Is that it? That's it. Thank you for coming. WAITING LIST Sir? Sir? Are you looking for someone? I was about to leave. You can stay if you wish. No, thanks. Let's see, Rita... Your lips look pretty good to me. - What do you want done? - When I see them in photos, they look too thin to me. Especially the top one. - I think I can do something. - Right. Why are you doing this? It's for a regular... I mean, a friend. I thought you girls never got involved. We can't. Rule number one. He's such a charmer. He talks but he listens too. Anyway, I want something simple, nothing exaggerated, OK? Don't worry. I'll do something subtle. He's got a bitch of a wife. Ex-wife, I should say. Wait a sec. - Hallo. - Edmundo! - Mum, I told you not to call me here. - Why did you hide - the cemetery letter? - What were you doing in my room? - Did you read it? - I read it. - You shouldn't look at my stuff. - This is not your stuff. It's mine. It's not right. Do I do that to you? - No, but... - You see... That letter was addressed to me! I know that letter was for you. But I wanted to protect you, that's all. Protect me? What's going to happen to your father? Please don't cry. You know I don't like you to cry. Mum, take it... Mum? Hallo? Sorry about that. - Where were we? - The lips. Right. Relax, OK? This won't hurt. - Look what the cat brought in. - Hi. Hi. Come in. Thanks. There. - Hallo, beautiful. - Dad, I'm glad you came. How's my pumpkin? Feeling better? - Yes. - Good. - Look, feel this. - What is there to feel? It's only five weeks. I can feel it. Right, Dad? - Paulita... - Don't Paulita me. - I thought you were on my side. - What? I don't know what your father told you, but this is a grown-ups' decision. Are you staying for dinner? Sure. Thanks. - Is this the novel? - Yes. She doesn't want anyone to read it. So I won't read it. What a reasonable man. - You make it sound like a fault. - No. - Paulita? - What? - Here's your book. - Leave it outside the door. Why don't you have dinner with us? I don't want to. - You need to eat. - I'm not hungry. Is there something? No. Can I help? - Any news? - Yes, I got a call from the firm. And? A strange experience. I hadn't been back for four years. Ismael Méndez called, the new chief executive. Ismael Méndez! He's so young! There he was, sitting in my chair, in my office, under grandfather's portrait. Very nice. We talked about football, the weather... about the best time to go to Ireland. He wants to change his car. Did he offer you anything? Of course. Coffee. Bastards! He asked me all about Roberto Vargas. Remember my deputy? Can you pass me that, love? - Hallo! - Hallo! You left in a hurry last night. She's a customer. No, no. Pablo just organized that shelf. He's anal, you know. What a pain. So... I've got good news. - What? - Guess. You bought me a car. No, I talked to my supervisor. Little Red Riding Hood's owner? Don't be silly. I told him I knew you. He won't ask for any papers or guarantees because the amount you need isn't too much. Aren't you happy? Edmundo? Esmeralda? Have I come at a bad time? Yes. I mean, no. Esmeralda, you know... I'm not good at these long things. They always end badly. I think it's best to stop when things are up here. Up there. Otherwise the fall is too painful. One has only happy memories then. Really? I'd better go. Bye. Bye. Do you need anything? Do you remember me? At the Philharmonic audition? You're a musician and a carabinero? - Good combination. - Sir, listen... You're a great player, but it's time to stop. - It's time to retire. - I don't get it! What do you want? Your time's up. It's the turn of a new generation. - You're the new generation? - Yes! It's my turn now. It's only fair. Be patient, you'll get your chance. It has to be now! You might live twenty more years. Calm down! I'm tired of blowing that pipe. I have high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart problems... What's going on? Everything's fine. Kid... have a beer, embrace a nice woman and relax. Enjoy your youth. You have time. He robbed me! He stole my wallet! Carabinero, carabinero! - Do something! - I'm a musician! My clarinet! I just want this to be over soon. Hopefully. I've been told it's a traumatic experience. You've been told? You've been talking about this? To no one. Of course not. I've heard about similar experiences. I'd better be going. A lot of work tomorrow? Good joke! It's not a joke. - Bye. - Bye. Stay. Let's not confuse matters. Can I ask you a favour, Jorge? Don't come if you're not invited. Fine. Son of a bitch! Anything else? Yes. You're disgusting. You're a pig. I've never been so at peace in all my life. Thanks for dinner. You pathetic pig. Abusive bastard. You like whores. Edmundo? Excuse me a minute, Héctor. Wait a sec. Come in. We need to have a serious talk. No, we don't. Everything's under control. - Have you been to the cemetery? - Yes, everything is settled. Is it very expensive to renew the grave? No. - How talkative you are! - Watch out! - What's the matter? - Careful. What's that? - What's that? - Nothing. Open it up! Open it up! You stole it. You were hiding it. Don't be silly, mum. Is this going to pay for your Ford? - It's valuable? - I don't know. Cute girl. Is it hers? I don't think so, A carabinero left it on the bus. - You stole it from a carabinero! - Mum! What does it say? Something about love? It's in a foreign language. Must be Swedish. Because of that blond. What do women always say? I love you, I love you, I love you... I own you. Are you going to keep that picture too? Mum. When did we last visit Dad's grave? 20 years ago? Or more? It's not necessary. He's here with us. Always. Your father was a decent man. It must be my fault you're like this. Miss? Did you like it? Very much. It surprised me. How does it end? I don't know. I'm still thinking about it. Don't lose the page. WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOU Hallo? Sir, please open the door. OK, OK, what's the rush? What's so urgent? Sorry. They removed my father's body. I guess it must be here. So? Don't put it in the furnace. We're not paid to deal with customers. You'll have to wait for the manager to come. But stop putting people in the furnace. One might be my father... Everything is already in there. Listen... Sir. Open the door, you motherfucker! I'll fucking kill you! Open up! You are uncouth. I apologize. But it's my father. My father! How many are there? How many? Altogether... twenty-three. What's your best price for a reburial? Including taxes. Open the door! Mario! Mario. I have neighbours! Shut up! Get dressed. The captain sent me to look for you. - No, I'm not going. - Come or they'll kick me out. I'm serious. - No, I'm not going. - Let me come in. Have you been partying? Last night I found a dead woman. Really? Yes. And someone stole my clarinet. I see. Astrid gave it to me. The blonde. When I came back to this fucking country, she said I was walking away from 20 years of happiness. What made you do it? She had been drinking when she said that. You're crazy. Everyone is allowed a minute of madness, Cortés. You've had yours. Captain, why did you want to see me? Open that drawer. I don't know what to say... Thank you! Really. "LUCKY BASTARD" Thank the man who found it and brought it in. - Is it all there? - Yes. He wishes me luck. This changes nothing. It's only for a short time. Will you make it to the Philharmonic? I don't doubt it. Tell me your name. - Where are you from? - Santiago. Right... - It's a loan of...? - Ten million pesos. Ten million pesos! - And that would be for...? - For an apartment. This is Jorge Robson. Please leave a message. Dad, where are you? Call me... or come. My appointment is at twelve. Bye.
