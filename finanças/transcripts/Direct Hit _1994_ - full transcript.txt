[music playing] JIM: Donovan Kovar, out of Chicago, controls 80% of the state's gun money. Larry Schupert, major gun distributor here on the west coast, does nearly $15 mil a year in ammo alone. Mr. Langert and Mr. Varger, black marketeers for top of the line, military weaponry. All four are together tonight. This chance may never come again. It's a cleanup job, Hatch. Pure cleanup. [music playing] So tell us-- tonight you're pulling your very first cleanup. What are you feeling? I got no feelings. Well, OK. Then, can you tell us what it's like working with veteran trigger man, John Hatch? Hatch's been with the agency a long time. He's got a hell of a rep. They say he's the deadliest man alive. But then again, they probably haven't heard of me. Now, have they? Word is, John's retiring. Tonight is his last job. How's it feel to be replacing the deadliest hit man alive. Let me tell you something-- Hatch is getting old. His number's up. Yeah. Sure, he's got a lot of experience, but like I've always said, who needs experience when you got this much firepower? Good point. Good point. Why don't you tell me what your game plan is? Game plan? Shit, boy, this ain't no game. Let me tell you something, doing a job is like anything else in life. It's easy or as hard as you make it. I personally choose to make it easy. Excuse me sir, I don't mean to inconvenience you, but your number's up. Pop! End of story-- You, you don't appear to be nervous. Aren't you worried? Shit no! Are you kidding me? This kid's got nerves of steel. Let me tell you something, the secret to staying alive is staying cool. You keep your head, plug your target, go home, smoke a jay, find yourself a sweet little Betsy, and before you know it, you're surfing a pink wave into the land of satisfaction. Just gotta remember the three basic rules, stay cool, stay cool, and stay cool. Got any other questions, cause I gots to go. Just one. What is the life of a hit man really like? Electrifying. Fabulous car, sir. Good evening, Mr. Langert. Good evening, ma am. [music playing] Mr. Kovar, welcome, welcome. Nice to see you. Thank you. Everybody, Mr. Kovar is here. [clapping] This your first clean up? Yeah. [gun cocking] Don't make it messy. I did better with direct hits. I hate direct hits. Ladies And gentlemen dinner is served. A dinner like you've never had-- for an appetizer we have a Zimmerman XT one with laser sighting. My personal favorite-- we bought these at Saddam's insane going out of business sale. Heh? Now, the entree-- a Russian treat-- about the only good thing you get out of Russia. That's wonderful. We intercepted as they were trying to smuggle it out of the country. It's a kluge stinger with a reversible clip. Shut the door. Aren't we going in? Just shut the door. Straight from Afghanistan Straight into Watts. [car engine revving] Uzi blanc 12. Black brothers are gonna love it. Get out of the way! [screaming] Come on! [inaudible] [horn honking] Oh. Step on it. Go! DRIVER: Down, Mr. Kovar! Yeah. [gunshots] COVAR: Shoot that son of a bitch. Ah! [inaudible] dammit! I got it Mr. Kovar. It looks like they hit me really light. It's fucked! [sirens] [firetruck horn honking] [screams] [tires screeching] Let me get some tokens. [gunshots] Oh, Hatch. Good boy. Come on up. TV ANNOUNCER: [inaudible]-- Look at that. TV ANNOUNCER: [inaudible] a black mafioso this evening. Names are being withheld, except for the one man who escaped the firefight, and that's Steve Phillips, a convicted felon. That's the guy taking the fall. TV ANNOUNCER: With us now is Sergeant Morgan. Sergeant Morgan, can you tell us what happened this evening? Well, as we understand, at about 21 hundred hours, there was cream colored Jaguar, that careened into the uh restaurant during the-- Hatch, I'd like you to meet-- Terry Daniels, Chief of Operation, New York City division. I heard a lot about your work. Thank you, sir. Terry's been with the agency 26 years. Kind of turning over a new leaf. JIM: From the agency to the senate-- Natural progression, huh. HATCH: I wouldn't know, sir. Jim tells me you're retiring. HATCH: Yes Tonight was supposed to be your last job? Tonight was my last job, sir. Well, we have a little problem. I got this envelope in the mail and uh-- it was this. I've been married for 20 years. I have four children. I go to church-- for Christ sake. I don't have to tell you what a photo like that will do to my campaign. Her name's Savannah Miles. Works a strip joint across town. Jim, I don't work here anymore. It's just one more job, Hatch. I don't want one more job, Jim. It's a direct hit. I don't like direct hits. I didn't fly 3,000 miles to be turned down by some two-bit trigger puller. To be honest with you, sir, I really don't care how many miles you flew, nor what you think of me. I'm out. Thought we had a deal. We do, Terry. We do. I'll take care of it. Real charmer, huh. JIM: God dammit, Hatch, I was going to give the job to that rookie you worked with tonight. It's a cake walk. HATCH: If it's such a cake walk, Jim, why don't you do it? That rook was your responsibility. That's bullshit. My responsibility was to take out the targets. I did it. Now, I'm finished. Come on, Hatch. She's just some low life, blackmailing slut. Do her on the way home-- for Christ sake. I'm not doing it, Jim. Let me put it another way. You are doing it or that quarter of a million dollar job you did tonight-- it didn't happen. Get the picture? [music playing] Well, I need satisfaction to satisfy the soul. [inaudible] MC: Hey, how about some applause for Heather and Rachel? [whistling] Come to daddy. Come to daddy. OK then, fuck you. Next, we have sexy Savannah and Jackie. [music playing] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Savannah, what is this? This is what we talked about. I don't think we talked about a shirt. We said that it would be sexier to leave something to the imagination rather than stripping like everyone else. Yeah, well, the people want to see flesh. That was not in our contract. Well, I know it's not in your contract, but this ain't Sunday school, baby. Now take the shirt off and get on with it. Get away from me! Who gives a shit about dancing? They want to see bush, you understand, bitch! Let go. Hey, come back here, goddammit! Who the fuck are you? Johnny. MAN: Yo bitch, give me my fucking money! WOMAN: I don't have any fucking money! [interposing voices] [music playing] Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been three months since my last confession. All I ever wanted to do is love and raise my little girl. I have a little girl. Her name is Annie. I tried so hard to give her what she needed. But, now I lost her, and I'm so angry that I lost her. It's not fair! What kind of mother loses her daughter? What kind mother lets someone take her baby away? I'm so angry. I'm so angry. I know I'm a sinner. And I know I'm the worst kind. I just have to die. I just have to die. I'm sorry, father. What about Ferguson? Come on. I'm on the telephone. Now, you're off the fucking phone. What is it? The girl's not a blackmailer. I'm not going to kill her. Now just give me my goddamn money, Jim. You're right. She's not. She's not blackmailing Daniels. Oh, she fucked him, no doubt about that. But the extortion threat, that someone else's. Yeah, and he just wants to kill her anyway, huh? You and your fucked up morality. Just give me my goddamn money, Jim. JIM: Finally caught up with you, didn't it, Hatch, who you are. You thought because you worked for the agency that you were doing a service for this country. You're Patriot, Hatch. You're a cold blooded killer. That's what you are. You're right, Jim. That's what I am. But not anymore. You think you can just walk away from the agency? No one walks away from this agency, Hatch-- no one. Be seeing you around, Jim. Oh and another thing-- don't worry about the girl. We'll just get someone else to do the job. TV ANNOUNCER: In a world of compromises and empty promises, Kerry Daniels is a breath of fresh air. After faithfully serving his country for 25 dedicated years as head of the CIA, Terry Daniels is a man who knows how to get things done. With his plans and commitment, Terry Daniels is ready to rebuild our nation by restoring hope in its people. Isn't it time for a change? Isn't it time for a man we can trust in Congress? Isn't it time for Terry Daniels? Bust your balls, huh? [inaudible] asshole. Don't sweat it. It happens to the best of us. Take out one too many Johns-- doing little kids-- shit builds up, you lose your balls. So glad you can relate. Orville Frasier Hamilton? Orville? Shit. That's enough to keep me from retiring. Get stuck with a name like Orville-- I thought about retiring. Problem is, what next. Remember Phil Grub? Pulling in nearly 2 mil a year, when he retired-- not long before he put a bullet in his brain. Sounds like a good idea. Maybe we ought to try the same some time. Is there a point to this little story of yours, or you just gonna miss me? Huh, sweetie? Gotta be what you are, Hatch. You know what? You're right. You're absolutely right. See you around, asshole. By the way, that little dancer looks like she's my contract now. She's innocent. Don't put that shit on me. She's a hit. She's a score. That was always your problem, Hatch. You turned your target into people. Can't do that. Can't do that. I've been working on plans for your cabin. How's it coming? Coming along real nice-- what do you think about putting a fireplace in your bedroom? Sounds good, Pop. You know I always like to sleep by the fire. Yeah. Your mother said you we're always afraid of the dark. That's why you slept by the fire. You know, Brian Johnson-- he pulled a 10 pound bass out of this lake last week. Whew. [laughing] Whoa, ho, ho, ho-- there ya go. Oh, this damn disposal is never going to work. Thought you were gonna have Mick fix that, Pop. Didn't I tell you? He passed away. Uh-- they knew he had cancer. But it ain't him up faster than anyone expected. I'm sorry, pop. I know you two were close. Two little boys-- they lost their own father. No one deserves that. I still have those Lincoln Logs and that Erector set you used to play with. I was thinking of giving it to the boys. Sure, Pop. I didn't realize you still had those. Well, I'm going to turn in. Don't worry. I'll finish up down here. We got to get up early tomorrow. We're going to catch the big one. Good night, Pop. It's good to have you back. Mommy! POP: John! John, where are you going? I gotta go, Pop. But you said you were going to stay. I can't. There's something I gotta do. [interposing voices] [speaking spanish] Help me, please! [inaudible]! [banging] SAVANNAH: Police. Police! Listen to me. I'm not gonna hurt you. Just listen to me. Get off of me. Listen to me please. Get off of me! Listen to me. Just shut up and listen to me! There are people that want you dead. No shit. I'm not one of them. I'm here to help you. OK. Now if you want to live, just do what I tell you. Look. Somebody is blackmailing Daniels. I haven't seen this picture in 10 years. All right. Who has the negatives? - What are you talking about? - What? Am I talking Swahili here? I'm asking you, who has the negatives to these pictures? It's very important if you want to live. Sam. Who's Sam? Sam Deets, my ex. Oh my God. He has my daughter. [door creaking] Why are we running from the police? These people own the police. Now come on. Who are you talking about? Who are you? Let's just say I'm on your side. Oh, really? Do you always ask so many questions? In situations like these, yes. Take it easy. Get the fuck out of the car. Come on. Get outta here. MAN IN CAR: Here's the keys. [phone ringing] Yeah? I'll be right there. Stay here. [crying] TERRY: Double-crossed by one of your own men. Jesus Christ, Jim. Hatch is a wild card. Let me deal with it, Terry. The subjects were last seen at the corner of Pico and Overland. That's where Sam Deets lives. All units, all units report immediately to 5681 Overland Avenue. First unit on the scene, report in. Her fingers are broken. They tortured her. There's nobody here. Please, please don't hurt me. Where's Sam? I don't know where Sam is. What are you doing here? I swear. I don't know anything. I've only known Sam for a few weeks. It's not even serious. What's your name? Shelly. It's Shelly McClain, Sam's girlfriend. Are you OK? I listened to her screaming. They kept asking about some negatives and where Sam was. Rosita didn't know. Then they stopped asking questions, and she just kept screaming. I was too afraid to move. Get down. Get down! What? It's the police. Let's go! You, inside Come on. What are we going to do? Improvise. Come on. Come out with your hands up! Now! Trust me. I want you to listen to me! And listen to me real good!

Shut up. God. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I said, shut up! I didn't do anything to deserve this. Shut up! The cops have them surrounded at Deet's house. Good. OK? Like shooting fish in a barrel. Terry? What. Let us take care of it. - I want to know your name. - My name is John. John who? John Doe. What the hell does it matter? So what's your involvement in all this? Look, don't ask me any fucking questions right now. Don't you think I deserve to ask. I got news for you lady. What you deserve and what you get are two different things. Keep an eye on her. I don't want her running away. I'm gonna try to get us outta here. Hatch. My name is John Hatch. Are we just going to stay here? So how long have you known Sam? Not very long. Do you live here with him? Mm. We've talked about it. WOMAN: (ON THE TELEPHONE) Good evening. And thank you for calling The Carriage Inn motel located at 66-- You love him? He's great in bed too. I guess you already know that. Yeah. I know where he is. Where? Ah shit. What the hell is the swat team doing here? Oh, no sweetie, that's no swat team. Who called you guys here, now? What the fuck's going on? Shh. Take cover. Let's do it. [gunfire] All right, Clean it out. What are we going to do? What are we going to do? Get your heads down. [inaudible] Whoa! Whoa! Jesus, man! What have you got? Shelly's got him, sir. All right, we gotta find Deets. Shelly, you go to the police. You tell them we need protection. Don't fucking move. Sam is a lot of things, but great in bed isn't one of them. Put the gun down or I'll blow his fucking head off. Don't do it, Savannah. Put it down. Don't do it. You're not a killer, Savannah. You can't pull that trigger. What's the matter, Shelly? You're feeling a little nervous, huh? Shut up. This is what they taught you at the Academy? Shut up. Your first assignment, huh? I said shut up or I'll blow your fucking head off. Hey, you going to blow my fucking head off? Then blow my fucking head off. I mean, if you're a professional, you would've all ready done it anyway. Drop the gun, bitch! Shoot her. I'll kill him. Shoot her. Shoot her. Fucking shoot her! - Drop it! - You want to kill me? Kill me. I'm getting a little tired of hearing you talk about it anymore. Don't you dare. Come on. HATCH: [screams] What do you think you were? Untouchable? Nobody crosses this agency. Nobody. That's me. Where's Deets? - Fuck you. I said, where's Deets? Fuck you! I got no pity for you, Hatch. You did this to yourself. HATCH: [screams] Hello, Savannah. You look beautiful as ever. Where's Deets? I said, where's Deets? HATCH: [screams] Has your conscience cleared up any, Hatch? That's what this is about, right? Some kind of act of penance-- Yeah. Yeah. I been reborn, Jim. How many people have you killed, Hatch? How many nameless faces have you sent to the grave? You think by protecting this girl you're going to redeem yourself? You're just going to get yourself killed. Do what you gotta do, Jim. [screams] Who'd of thought that one night in Vegas would have caused us both this much trouble. It was that little prick of a boyfriend of yours, Deets. I knew he was a shit, soon as he introduced us. How can a guy date a dancer, and still push her on other men? Well, his time will come just like the rest of us. You sick, deranged, psychopath. Why do you think I'm running for office? HATCH: [screams] Why are you doing this to me? [laughing] You're the one doing it, Jim. Fuck you. Hatch, I'd like you to meet Mr. Phelps. Mr. Phelps met your dad last night. He told me to tell you, hi. What else did he have to say, Mr. Phelps. Yeah-- something like, ooh, please stop. It didn't make any sense at all after that. Let's get this over with. SAVANNAH: [screaming] Now what? HATCH: We gotta find Deets. Our only chance for survival is if we find the negatives and hand them over to Daniels. Do you know where Deets is? Maybe. Hatch. John. What's the matter? They killed my father. Fuckers killed my mom. John, talk to me. You don't want to know me. Leave it alone. Just leave it alone. You're risking your life for me. I don't know you. And for me, you're risking your life. I'll let you in on a secret. It's no loss. Stay here. I'm going to check out the room. Deets! Where's Annie? Where's my baby? I don't have her. Terry-- Terry had her all along. When they trashed my house, I barely got out alive. You left her with him? You fucking bastard. They were gonna kill me. How could you do that? I was gonna make $5 million. $5 million-- $5 million-- $5 million dollars! Where are the negatives? Give me the negatives now! Give me the negatives! OK. OK. [crying] How'd you get mixed up with an asshole like that? SAVANNAH: I was just 15. Sam was -- Sam was older, more established. I felt he could protect me, make up for the father that I never had. He-- he brought me to Vegas one day-- I've never been to Vegas before. Introduced me to these corporate types at a party and there was all this coke and dope going around. And pretty soon, it was obvious why I was there. At one point I was naked on top of Terry, and Sam-- he pulled out this camera and he just said, smile baby. And I smiled. I was just 15. Where is my baby? I want my baby. I want my daughter. It'll be all right. No, it's not all right. Nothing's all right. $40 million operation center, here-- it's state of the arts surveillance, computerized tracking system, overpaid professionals, mercenaries, and one distraught finger man puts the whole thing to shame. Terry the situation is under control. Yeah, his! We're doing the best we can. Sir, the subject is calling on line two. Johnson. Still alive, huh, asshole? Put Daniels on the phone. Listen to me real good, you prick. You've got something I want. I got something that you want. Now you be at the McCaffrey steel mill. Don, you bring the little girl, or I could think of about 15 newspapers that would love to get their hands on those negatives. And Daniels, you make sure nothing happens to that little girl or there's going to be no place on this earth that you can hide. End of story. Where are we going? My place. You'll be safe there. You live here? Follow me. This is cozy. Sort of that arctic feel without the snow. Glad you like it. Here you go. Thanks. I'm going to go get us something to eat. Sandwiches OK? Sure. It's safe. Try to get some rest. What are you doing down here? Huh? What are you doing here? What's the matter with you? You don't listen? You go sticking your nose in other people's business. No wonder people want you dead! Who are you? Stop asking me questions. All right. Leave me alone! Who are you? I'm nobody. You understand me? I'm nobody. I don't exist. Did you kill all those people? You're damn right I did. Talk to me. Talk to me. I was raised in a good family. I was a good kid, strong athlete, outstanding student always. Mr. 4.0, you know, cream of the crop. By the time I was 20 years old, the agency first contacted me. I was so patriotic. I so enthusiastic. I wanted to serve my country. I killed people. I killed men. I killed women. I always tried to find something, but I know who was guilty. Most of them were. Some weren't. But I killed them anyway. If I could turn back the clock and I could start over, I would. But I can't. guess I'm just a [inaudible]. Just a cold-blooded murderer. [music playing] Not that I'm scared to be on my own. Well, this day I'm tired, of being alone. Sometimes I run from love cause love has bee tough. Love can be rough. But I pretended this life alone. Alone isn't love. Alone's not enough. But in my heart, in my soul, room enough for two. In my prayer, my prayer. Room enough for two. I got room. Room enough for two. I guess that I'm tired of being alone. Because I'm [inaudible] that this life alone. Alone isn't love. Alone's not enough. For being alone. Room enough for two. Jim, you've known Hatch for 10 years. Couldn't you have seen something like this coming? I expected it. Why didn't you something about it? It's something we all go through. Usually, it passes. This time it didn't. This time it didn't. You forgot the golden rule. There are no excuses. There are no excuses. Get an order, see a face on a photograph-- It's a target. A moving target. You follow it. You observe it. You note its behavior. You wait. At the right time, you sight it. Inhale. Hold your breath. Pull the trigger. The target goes down. And you go home to your family. We don't cause tears. We don't widow wives. We don't orphan children. You do it long enough-- Then you get an office, and a desk. Now you give the orders and someone else does it. Next morning you read in the paper, a young girl was found lying in the gutter with a brain splashed in the mud. Jim, stop reading the paper. Terry, take my advice. Exchange the girl for the negative, and get on with your career. Sorry. He failed to do a job. Terry-- He failed to do a job. One to your right-- to your right, Hatch. You've got two men to your left, two men to your left. There's one behind the wall. And there's one on the wall. And one climbing the debris. Hatch, you've got another one to your left. There's one running towards you, one behind the mound. All right. Here. Just stay right here. Here. Sorry to lose you, Hatch. The best goddamn finger man I ever saw. Thanks. Terry has a gun! I can't let you go. Not today, two face. [screaming] Don't move. Stay right here. Stay down. OK. I'll be right back. You sold out, Hatch. You fucking sold out. [helicopter] Look what you've done. You stupid son of a bitch. You had it all. Now look at you. You're dead. You killed yourself. I've done worse. SAVANNAH: Stop! Get back! Haven't you had enough? Isn't this enough? I'm out, Jim. Living doesn't matter anymore when your living like you and me. Hello, Savannah. You're pulling the trigger, John. You made the decision. I all ready made my decision. Come on. I'll get you to a hospital. I don't want your hospital. I don't want your help. All I want is out. You're out. Go inside. Why, John? Because it was wrong. Because you didn't deserve to die. That's why. What you deserve and what you get are two different things. Not this time. [music playing] Not that I'm scared to be on my own. Well, this day I'm tired of being alone. But sometimes I run from love cause love has been tough. Love can be rough. But I pretended this life alone. Alone isn't love. Alone's not enough. But in my heart, in my soul. In my prayer. My prayer. I got room. Room enough for two. I guess that I'm tired of being alone. But [inaudible] that this life alone. Alone isn't love. Alone's not enough.
