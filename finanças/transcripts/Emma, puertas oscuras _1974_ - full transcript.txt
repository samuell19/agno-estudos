Help. I can't see. I'm blind. Help me. Calm down. Calm down... don't worry, the doctor's coming. That's it. Now you sleep for a while. You're not to blame for the accident. I know, Doctor. But despite everything I feel indebted to her, all alone, no family. Your frame of mind is understandable Dr. King, believe me. I understand. Your wish to help the patient is natural. And taking into account the solid guarantees offered by your husband, I'm willing to let you take her to your home. Thank you, Dr. Donovan. You must realize that it will be harder to keep her under observation than here at the hospital. If you take her with you... you mustn't forget you'll be taking full responsibility. Yes, I know. You can be sure I'll be with her constantly. I promise you we'll take care of Emma day and night until she recovers completely. That's fine. Come in. Emma. Thanks for coming. Don't worry. Everything is over now. I thought this moment would never come. I always fulfill my promises. Your turn. Ah, this is my chance. Right. A holiday in the sun will do you a lot of good. Why don't you come with us to the Bermudas? Yes, John is right. I must confess I feel the need to take some days rest. What do you say, dear? Yes, it'd be very pleasant. Excuse me. Don't be long. Hello... yes, she's here. What? Ah, I see. I'll pass the message on to Mrs. King at once. Or perhaps you want to talk to her? Ah, very good... bye. I'm sorry. What's the matter, John? It was Rosa, your servant. I'm sorry Silvia. Emma has suffered a small crisis. Oh, my God. Darling. Calm down. According to her, it's not serious. Steve, we must go back home immediately. Oh, what a pity! Don't get bent out of shape, dear. It's not the first time it's happened. Yes, I know. Well, I'll come with you. I'm very sorry Silvia, poor Emma. Excuse us, please. Of course. Don't worry, dear. Everything will be all right, you'll see. I'm sorry, Madam. What happened, Rosa? What always happens. Miss Emma is a very difficult girl. She didn't want to listen to me and she started to scream and insult me. She said I had put frogs under her pillow. She's always inventing bizarre stories. I tried to help her, but you know what happens when Miss Emma acts like that. Are you leaving? Yes, Sir. I already told you things couldn't continue like this. Please, be patient. Give it one more try. I'm sorry Sir, I think it could be dangerous to stay here. Something is going to happen one day. Come now Rosa, don't exaggerate. No Madam, I'm not exaggerating. The other staff before me, they didn't stay around for long. Where is she, in her bedroom? Miss Emma left the house. What? It couldn't be avoided, Madam. She was furious and I was scared. It's all right. Don't worry, I'm sorry about what happened. I'm really sorry. Thanks Rosa. Goodbye. Where can she be now? Don't worry. I'll find her. There's nothing in your hand that says you're going to lose your sight. Don't worry honey. Everything is going to be ok. Now, you must try to relax. You're not like most people I know. Look at my hand. This line, probably, indicates the day we met. I'm sure you'll get many things from life. Good things. I just want Silvia to understand me. I have always wished to know someone who needed me. I sometimes think Silvia doesn't realize how much I love her. Come on. You are stupid. Pick up your things. I clearly warned you. I told you to leave Emma in peace. Why don't you say it to her? I say it to you Lupe. And for the last time! Don't you think Emma is old enough to do whatever she wants? Maybe, if she could act like a normal girl. She is as normal as you and me, Silvia. If you meet Emma again, I'll ruin your life, Lupe. And I have resources enough to do it. Yes, I know. Why did you come here, to that hussy? I had an argument with Rosa and I couldn't sleep. Besides, I was lonely. You have sleeping pills. Listen to me Emma, I forbid you to meet her or to talk with her again. Lupe understands me. That mixed blood only thinks of your money. That's not true. No matter if you believe me or not. Your relationship with Lupe is over. Sometimes you're so cruel with your words. They are full of evil. Only I know what it would mean to go back to that awful place. I couldn't bear it. I still see the faces in my nightmares. Their cries and laughs. Their eyes staring at me from every corner. And their screams waking me up at night. I couldn't! Don't think about it anymore, Emma. Promise me you won't let them lock me up again. There's nothing to be afraid of... if you behave yourself. Good afternoon, Mr. King. Here are your plane tickets and hotel reservations for the Bermudas. Thank you. I trust everything is ok. Anything else, sir? Eh, yes Miss Evans, would you mind calling my wife? Right away, sir. Hello? Mrs. King is on the phone. Thanks. Silvia? Hi darling, I'm calling because I forgot to tell you I'll be later than I expected tonight. I must finish a job before leaving. I've already booked the reservations. We're going next Friday. I decided to bring forward the holiday. If you want we can go out to supper later. No thanks, I'm going to be busy. Emma's going to the country this afternoon and I have to help her with her luggage. I see. I hope she appreciates everything. Emma's aware of everything that's going on. Sorry for my sudden decision to bring forward the holiday, but I need a change of scene. Silvia... are you listening to me? Yes darling, I'm listening to you. John is right, we need a good holiday. Far away from everyone. Only you and me, Silvia. Without Emma. Emma... Emma. Please, enough of this nonsense. I'm not in the mood for games. Tell me, what's the matter with you? Why are you going on holiday with him? Because I have to go. Why do you have to go? It's better like that. Why? It's not easy to explain certain things. Especially, the relationship between man and woman. Come on Emma, come out of here. He wants me to be locked up again in that place, doesn't he? I'll never let him do that. And now, come out of the wardrobe. Do what I say. Are you afraid of me? That's enough! You are afraid of me, aren't you? Rosa was also afraid of me. That's why she left. My poor little Emma. Don't feel sorry for me. I can do that myself. Nobody is feeling sorry for you, nor looking down on you. That's your obsession. Nobody has ever needed me. I think that even my mother hated me. Don't talk nonsense, why would your mother not love you? My mother hated me and my father. I adopted you to give you affection. Don't worry. Even Steve loves you, Emma. I know you love me, but I'm sure your husband hates me. You'll be fine with the Dixon's. They're a charming couple. You'll feel better after some time in the country with them. Don't worry about my health, sometimes I find it annoying. Emma darling, forgive me. I'm only worried about your welfare. Calm down. I promise I'll write to you everyday. Two or three times at least. You'll know everything I'm doing. This afternoon you hung up the phone on me. We had said as much as we had to say to each other. That's not the question. Yes, it is. Especially when the conversation is about Emma. I didn't mean to offend you, darling. It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. I'm sorry for my attitude towards the girl. Now, let's forget about it. We'll soon be out of here. Enjoying the perfect holiday, for which I've waited a long time. I've prepared a cold supper. I'm sorry it can't compare to Rosa's. It's a pity she didn't adapt to Emma's character. Adapt to Emma? You're talking as if the rest of us are the abnormal. Excuse me, darling. But you must admit she'd be better if she went back to her rightful place. Surrounded by people like her. This situation is dangerous for all of us. You must understand that. I am the axis of her whole existence and perhaps her only shelter. Don't exaggerate. She's convinced I'm the only one who can cure her, and perhaps she's right. Darling, I disagree. After the accident, Emma was in my care at the hospital. We ended up knowing one another too well... Yes... Only I know how she is. But it was long ago since you practiced as a psychiatrist. That's true, but she needs me. You have no need to complicate your existence. Something strange has happened. Look. Take a look at this. What's the matter? My wallet. Someone has opened it while we were at supper. That's not possible, Steve. We are alone in the house. Look for yourself. You could be wrong. I can assure you someone has opened it and has taken the plane tickets and some other documents. Steve, you're so absent minded. It wouldn't surprise me if you had come back home with your wallet empty. And tomorrow morning you'll find everything on your desk at the office. Emma. Emma! Emma, answer me. I know you're there. The game's over. That's enough Emma, come out from there. Why have you come back? I can't forget you. Steve. It's nothing. I just forgot something. Wait! Many strange things are happening tonight. Why don't you tell me the truth? It will make things easier. Enough! Please, will you sign? Come on, help me. I can't do it all by myself. I can't. That's silly, of course you can. You hated him as much as I did. You have no choice but to help me. Come on. I'll need a week to sort it all out. Tomorrow I'll go to the bank to get some money from my current account. It's a pity you tore up the plane tickets. We could have used them. Are you angry with me? I should be. It was a terrible storm last night. I hate storms and the one from yesterday scared me a lot. We won't lose power, will we? I don't know. No, probably not. I'm afraid of the dark. It's like being blind. I have always been afraid of going blind. It must be horrible. Can you imagine it? You must take a sleeping pill. It will be good for you to sleep for a while. It horrifies me to think of the possibility of going back to that awful place you took me out of. And perhaps forever. That's enough Emma. Go to sleep. I'm thinking of what to say to the director of the bank. He was a good friend of Steve's. He'll be surprised when he sees me withdraw so much money from my account. I hope to find no difficulties and that everything goes well. It would be better if we disappeared for some time. Do you understand? We have to start making plans. If luck is with us, nobody will find out. We have to think of everything. Remember, in our situation difficulties can arise at any moment. It would be better to go abroad. But, where are we going to? I still haven't decided. It doesn't matter, any place far away enough from here. But nobody must know where we are. It'll be easy. What's the matter, darling? Lupe. Lupe must know where to find me. I have told you many times that I forbid you to see her again. Are you listening to me? But I just want... Never, never, Emma. You have already complicated everything with your stupid way of acting. You must learn to control yourself. Don't forget, I can take you back to the hospital. I can do it whenever I want, Emma. You must learn to obey, otherwise I'll have to take you back to the hospital forever. And this is what you fear to happen. I wouldn't like to hurt you. I'm sorry darling, forgive me. My nerves are all on edge. Don't worry, you know I'll never hurt you. I loved her. I can't burn her. She thought to take me back to that awful place. I'll bury her, but where? Good evening Miss, may I help you? Excuse me, what do you want? Fill it up, please. Is it far to the Jetty Hotel? Not far, about ten miles. But the hotel was closed long ago. It's deserted. Thanks. I'm very sorry. It's not easy to find another one before Elms Gate. Do you have a phone? Yes, inside Miss. Thanks. Come on. Listen, is it true that girl's going to Elms Gate? Yes, she's going north. So perhaps she wouldn't mind taking us to the crossroads? Ask her yourself. Yes, good idea. Excuse me, but my friend and I are heading north. There's a hotel next to the crossroads, could you take us there? We won't cause you any trouble. What do you say? Stand aside. Sorry Miss, that's two pounds and ten pence. Thanks. Oh, come on, my friend is half dead. We've been walking all day. Scared we'll get your car dirty? Well, what do you say? The attendant said you were going that way. Alright! Come on. Thanks. It's very kind of you. This is Cleo and I'm Buddy. Not very original names, but these are the ones we have. Eh, haven't we met before? Well, this young lady is not too friendly. Pity. This is Cleo. Ah, shut up. And don't disturb the driver. Do you mind...? Let's put some music on, eh? That's it! Now that's better. Listen, our friends are waiting for us at the hotel. Why don't you come with us? We'll have a great time. You better wise up a little. Bah! Your cigarettes don't taste good. I have some that are much better. Not yet, Buddy. When we arrive. It could make us feel sick. You're right. Are you crazy? Come on, come on. Get out. Where are you going? Leave me alone. Cleo, take the wheel. I'm on it. Buddy, bad news. It's closed. I'll solve that. Is there anybody here? There's nobody. Do we reserve some rooms? I don't think it's necessary as we come with an important person. Look, there are leaks! I'm going to complain to the hotel management. This will wake up the ghosts. I hope not. Cleo, I think we should ask for a room for three people. Don't you agree? Good idea, but with only one bed. Yes, we'll ask for a very big bed. I think that sleeping three in the same bed is very hot. Yes, but above all it's more... fun. This should be ok. Let's have a look. The bed is here. But it's a little bit small, we'll have to squeeze ourselves in. How wonderful! Look! Someone did a runner and left their luggage as a guarantee. Listen, perhaps there's a corpse inside. Don't talk nonsense, Buddy. A friend of mine says that all the old hotels have a skeleton in the closet. It's not in the old hotels, but in the ancient families. Like the girl's? Eh, give me the bottle. Do you think it's all for you? Come on, love. Take a drop and you'll feel much better. Come on, cheer up. Another drop? That's it. You're not going to sleep, are you? Eh, Cleo, I think I'll have to use another system. Guess what happens now? Come on Cleo, help me. What's that? Nothing. Leave me alone with her. Listen Buddy. Can't we split from here now? No. I don't like this place. Cool it, love. Since the closet opened by itself, I don't like the look of this place. I want to have fun for a while. The party still hasn't started. And what can I do meanwhile? Why don't you take a look at the car? Perhaps you'll find something interesting. Yes, why not? Buddy. Buddy, don't... don't scare me. Buddy, Where are you? Buddy, where are you? Answer me. Are you there? Cleo! Help me! Help me... Help. Help. Help me. Can anyone hear me? Let me go. Let me go. Shut up stupid, and nothing will happen to you. No! Emma. Emma no, Emma that's enough. I said enough. Are you crazy? How far do you want to go? They were repulsive. They made me feel sick. You always say nobody wants to hurt me. But that's not true. Everybody's after me to hurt me. I called you because I thought you'd help me. But no, you are like all the rest. I ask you to help me and you go against me. I'm sure you're pursuing me. Like everybody else. You'd like to see me locked up again in that awful place. Emma wait. Emma! Emma, Emma, Emma listen to me. Nobody wants to hurt you. You and I will go far away from here. Are you listening to me, Emma? Nobody in the world could avoid it. All your enemies have disappeared. This is Lupe, your friend. You must trust me, Emma. You have always had my support. You call me asking for help and as you can see, I come here as fast as possible. But you must be more reasonable and do what I tell you. Listen to me Emma. We both can go now, but it must be at once. We cannot wait for those horrible dark suns that scare you so much. Nor for those cruel doctors and nurses who only want to lock you up forever. Emma, Where are you? What are you doing? Are you listening to me, Emma? Can you hear me? Emma, Emma... No
