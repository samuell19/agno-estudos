Oh my God. Scared you. I hate it when you do that. You're such a little girl. I am not. Yeah, you are. Knock it off. Ooh, you hit like a little girl too. I do not. Yeah, you do. Stop! Stop! Stop, God! You're a lousy date, okay? Aw! Billy, how could you say such things? You hurt my feelings. All right now you're too quiet. Either you're plotting your new way to get me or something's bugging you. You need a girlfriend. I need to tell you something. I know you're not gonna like this but, I have to leave for awhile so. What do you mean you gotta leave? I, uh... You, uh, what? I enlisted in the military. All right, there you go, I said it. Look, I'm sorry I told you like this but, I leave in two weeks, so. Why would you do this? Well, I want to serve my country. I have no focus in my life, I have no idea what I'm doing. So at least this way I figured, I figured I could accomplish something. I know you can't understand that, so whatever. Well I guess we won't be seeing each other for awhile. How long did you enlist for? Four years. Come on Billy. I mean, it's not like we had huge plans, we were gonna go work in your father's garage, you know? Schlep oil. Yeah I guess that's not much of a future. I can't believe you did this. I'm not gonna see you for four years? Look, Billy. We've been friends for a long time and, there's something else I need to come clean about. Oh God, another secret? I just thought there's a possibility that. I might not come back alive so... No, just don't say that, I can't, I can't handle you saying that you might not come back alive. Okay, I'm sorry. I was just thinking, you know, us being friends and all, did you ever think that, or feel that maybe we, you know what? Not a big deal, it can wait. - No. - Forget about it. No really, go on, I mean, I'm here to listen. It's late, you should get some sleep, it can wait. If you're sure. Yeah. Dean? Yeah? There's... there's something I think I need to tell you. I... you know what? You're right, it can wait till morning. But I want to go on the record saying I'm not happy that you're leaving. I understand, I understand that this is important to you. And I'm glad you're doing something that you feel is right. Thanks Billy. You've better come back alive. I promise I'll come back. Hey you. Hey. Did I look okay today? Yeah, you looked great. There was lots of people there. Yeah, there sure was. Is everybody gone now? Is it just you and me? Just you and me. You mean Uncle Jimmy and Aunt Bernice had to go? Yeah. They were nice to me. Yeah, it was a nice service, huh? Everybody thought you were very nice. We had a sister, huh? Yeah, she died when she was a little baby. She was very sick. Billy, why do some people go when they're just a baby, and some people go when they're old? Why did Mom and Dad go? I guess we all have our time to be here on Earth, doesn't matter what our age is. Oh, and that was the time for Mom and Dad to go. So why can't we go with them? Not our time. I want to see them one more time, I didn't even get to tell them goodbye. How will they know where we are? They'll know, they're probably looking down on us right now. Will we see them someday? And Sister? All the doggies will be there too, you always said they would be. Yeah, they will. That sounds like a nice place to live. I wish we could go now. Oh, no, it's not our time to go yet. What do you got? It's just a letter I wrote for Mom and Dad. Coulda read it at the funeral. No, it's just kinda for Mom and Dad and me. Is that okay? Yeah. Okay. Do you want to read it now? Yeah. All right. Dear... Mom and Dad. Do you want me to read it for you? Uh huh. Okay. Dear Mom and Dad, I'm gonna miss you a whole lot. It's good that you were my parents, because you were the best mom and dad in the whole world. I guess I'll be seeing you again someday, and we can all play together like we did here. Like when we would go to the lake and swim around, and eat marshmallows, and we'd cook on the fire. Billy is here now. He's gonna live with me, and he'll take care of me. I'll be okay Mom and Dad, don't you worry about me. I have a big brother, and I love you, and kid sister, and the dogs from Mimi 'cause I want to play with them too when I get there. Love Johnny. Oh it's okay. Some meal, huh? Not the same like it was before. I was gonna dress up and go to the Halloween party that the other kids are having but, I don't feel much like going. You don't have to go if you don't want. Maybe you'd feel better if you were with your friends. They'll probably miss you. Yeah, maybe so. Maybe I could go and stay for a little while. You know, and see them. You want to wear your costume? Oh, I don't know, I might go without it. You'll probably feel better if you put it on. You'll be the best looking guy there. Okay, I can wear it. Well you can put it on after dinner. Okay. What do you think Mom and Dad are doing? Probably visiting all our relatives, having a family reunion. Yeah. That must be what they're doing. Billy, you know I'm really happy you're here now, living with me again. I missed you a whole lot. Now you and me can do some fun things like we used to. I'm really happy I didn't have to live with somebody else, I wouldn't like that very much. I wouldn't like it either. You're the bestest brother in the world. No, you are. No you are. No you are! Hey Billy? Are you gonna stay with me forever? If you want me to. I want you to. Billy? I think I'm gonna be sad for a long time. I think I am too. Johnny? You in here? You okay? Dean? Hi Billy. What are you doing here? I was home on leave. I wanted to see you. Come in. I can't believe you're here. Sorry for the big surprise, I guess. I should've called first. No, it's fine. I'm just glad you're here. Things sure have changed. Yeah. Life has a funny way of doing that. Yeah. Are you hungry? Do you want something to eat? Are you tired after your trip? No, I'm fine. God I missed you. Did you miss me? Yeah. I have this dream, that you show up, you hold me. Tell me you're not gonna leave me, you're gonna stay. And when I wake up you're not there. I miss my mom and dad. I miss you. Please don't leave me again. Dean? Hey Johnny, what's up? Hey. I had a bad dream. I'm sad because I miss Mom and Dad. I miss them too. I don't like the dark much. I don't like it either. From now on, we're leaving the lights on at night. We can do that? Dad always said it has to be dark. Yeah, we can do anything we want. We're gonna be okay. Do you think Mom and Dad are happy? And they're okay? Yeah, you know what they're probably doing right now? What? Well, since there's no darkness in Heaven, they're probably running around with the dogs, and with Sister. It's always warm and sunny in Heaven. So they're swimming in the biggest swimming pool that there is. Swinging on the tree swing that we used to swing on. So you see, they're fine. You know what I do when I get lonely for them? What? I talk to 'em. You talk to 'em? Yeah. I tell them how I feel. And if you listen really carefully, you can hear them talk back to you. I think I'll be better now. I wasn't really afraid, I was just all alone. I don't like being alone much. I don't like it either. So, what are we gonna do now? Are we gonna get to live in this house and stay here? Or do we have to give it back? No, we're staying here, this is our home. I'm gonna get a job and, one that I can go to while you're at school and so I can be home when you are. What would your work be? I could probably get some kind of fishing boat job like I did up north. Up there? Wouldn't be the same kind of work, or pay, but, I'll be okay. We'll be fine. What do you call that? Well I was only trying to get the thing... No I know what you were trying to do, cheat. Oh my gosh, I think I beat you. Roll again and count it out. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Oh no, you're beating me! You're too good at this. Yeah. Do you remember my friend Dean? He used to live here, long time ago. His name was Dean? Yeah, he hasn't been around for awhile, but he used to come here a lot? Go ahead, roll. I remember him, he went to be the soldier, you have his picture, too, right? You remember that? Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Is he coming to see us? Well, he wants to, he wrote me a letter. How'd you feel if he came to live with us for awhile? Is he a nice person still? I mean, he sure was nice to me. Yeah I'm sure he's still a nice person. Well, then it's okay with me if he lives here! Okay. Was you and him best friends? Yeah, we were. We still are I hope. He's about the best friend I had, except for you. When will he be living here? In about two weeks. Sounds like he's had some really tough times in his life too. Why is he coming to live with us? Doesn't he have a mom and dad he can go see? No, when he was just a little baby his dad left. He never knew him, then his mom died when he was eight. So he had to go live with his aunt. It's sad that his mom died and his dad went away. I guess he'll need me to be his friend. I think he'd like that. But, don't worry, you're still my best friend. Ha, I'm beating you! Billy, Billy, Billy! Who are you and have you seen a military brat in the neighborhood? Man it's good to see you! It's great to see you, I can't believe you're here. This is really weird. I know, super weird. Seems like I just left. Yeah. Man I'm proud of you, look at you. Big man, man of the house, big brother too. Yeah well, you know we do these things for family. Gifts. For you and the little man, I know he likes to read. Thank you. Still a nice guy. Shucks, gomer. Come in, welcome home. Dinner's in an hour. Do you remember? We thought we could get away with it? We put that pail of water on Mr. Hanson's door, opened it, water everywhere. Oh, God. You guys were so funny. Are you okay? Is he? Water all over, troublemakers. Hey, we're not. - Yeah. - We're just boys being boys. Trying to find ways to entertain ourselves. God, do you remember how mean he was? He was a real son of a bitch. And especially his kids. Yeah, but he's dead now! Johnny. Dad always told me a man gets what he deserves in life, all right? All right. Johnny. What? Seriously Dean, it's really good having you here. I haven't laughed this much in a long time. We have fun here, huh Billy? Yeah. You should stay living here Dean. Thanks Johnny. I really appreciate that. That's too funny. Hey Billy. Hey, I brought you some towels, do you need anything else? No that's great. You sure you want to give me your bed? I don't... Oh, yeah of course, I mean, you're the guest. I'll get that other room cleared out for you in a couple days. It's filled with Mom's sewing stuff, I've been distracted. Hey this is great. This is weird. This is like, really weird. It's like I just left. I don't know, it's really nice being here. I'm just glad you came back in one piece. Yeah me too. You know every time I hear about those deaths in the military on the news, my heart just stops thinking I'm gonna hear your name. Would you relax Billy? Get over here, let's catch up. Boy, Johnny turned out to be a nice boy, didn't he? Yeah. It's a good thing he had you around. Especially being the way he is. I don't know what he would've done if I wasn't here. I'm really sorry about your parents. I just didn't know what to do for you. It's all right, there's nothing really anyone can do. Just, something we gotta work through. Life's so funny. Two days before my parents were killed, she called me up on the fishing boat where I was working, to tell me she loved me. She was worried about me. That I'd drowned. You know she's watch those shows on TV about how dangerous life on a fishing boat can be. She was sure I was gonna fall overboard, and drown in the icy water. And now she's gone. They're both gone, you know? It's just me and the kid. So how are you guys doing? Yeah, I mean, we're doing fine, you know? Johnny's handling it well enough. I tried to explain it to him the best I could. Hey look, as soon as I get back on my feet, I'm gonna get me a job, I'm gonna gladly help out. Don't even stress about that, just relax... No, really, I want to get a job as soon as possible. All right, just you know what? Tell me about those super secret Air Force special operations missions. Where to start? Training. The training was really tough. Lots of guys didn't make it, you know? Lots of guys didn't make it past the first few days. Hell, I almost didn't. But the missions, Billy, wow, sometimes you think you're gonna die, you know? And you... you really learn to trust the instincts of your buddies. Anyway, enough about that, we can catch up on that later. You been camping lately? A couple times, it's not the same without you. I have to tell you, I was really nervous about seeing you. I don't know what it is, just, time I guess. That's so silly I mean, we're best buds, friends forever. I'm just glad you're back. God, look at you, I mean, you're really in great shape. Air Force finally made a man out of you, huh? That's right, that's right, top shape, no flaws. 'Course they, they did put a microchip in my brain that controls everything I do. You just couldn't wait to get me! I'm sorry man, you're just too easy. This is what I miss, look, hanging out with you. I really like being back here. Don't get me wrong, I like the military stuff but, at least I don't have to get up at five in the morning, you know, stay up all night doing the fire watches. I was shocked to get your letter. I really thought you were gonna make this a lifelong career. Oh, you know, it's was just time. I was thinking about staying in, but with the injury thing and all, it... The what? Oh it was nothing really, I took a hit in the hip. Fine, we were out on a mission one night, a bomb went off, a little too close for comfort, close enough to do some damage, wrong place, wrong time, voila. That's awful. Not really, although you didn't know it. You almost didn't get to see me again, so. Well I bet you've seen a lot of the world, huh? Yeah. Seen a lot of everything. Yeah well, I should let you get to bed. Hey Billy. Thanks for taking me in. What are best friends for if they can't help each other out? I'm glad you're back. It'll be fun to have you around. I feel safe. Oh blah. Night. Hey, how am I doing? Well it looks good buddy. This is gonna be the greatest Christmas party in the whole world. They really smell good too, we should have one. No, nice try, they're for your party. Okay, you can have one. One. Hey guys. Hey Dean. - Hey Dean. - What's up? We're making cookies for my Christmas party. Oh yeah, looks like you're doing a heck of a job of it. We could probably have these for dinner tonight. No, nice try, and you smell like fish. Oh, well, aren't you cute? Little miss Betty homemaker in the kitchen. That's right I am, my fellow keeps my slaving away. Besides, I already put in my full shift today. How was yours? Oh, you know, it's okay. I'm getting the hang of it. Boss man sure is keeping a close eye on me though. You still getting those headaches? Once in awhile, no big deal. These cookies sure look good. You still smell like fish. Please exit the kitchen before you make the cookies smell. Come on. You know what? You hurt my feelings, I'm gonna go. Okay! Dean, do you want to help me put up Christmas lights later this week? Sure buddy, that sounds great, count me in. All right, it's all right. Hey, hey, hey! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Come on, you want to look like an old Christmas cookie? You suck! Dude. These are really good cookies, thanks. Gimme that cookie. I like this time of year best. Yeah, me too. Your brother and I used to go out, play in the snow. Those were some fun times. You really like your brother, don't you? Oh yeah, he's the bestest brother in the whole world. Yeah, he is nice. You guys like each other, don't you? Well, well yeah. Yeah we like each other, we're best friends. Sometimes, Billy would take me up to the snow hills, and we would go sledding, and then we'd build a snowman. But then we'd be freezing because we'd get snow in our boots and gloves, and we'd have to go home and get warm. Sounds like you guys had a good time. Yeah. Hey you know what? I bet we could drag Billy up to the snow, and do some sledding of our own. Really? That would be so fun. I know where the sled is too. I could go get it, and we could take turns going down the hill. Sounds like a plan. You know, since Billy went away I didn't get to go much. Dean? Are you okay? Yeah. It's just one of my headaches. Are you sure, 'cause I can get a doctor? No, no, I'm fine, really. It'll pass. Well maybe you should go see a doctor. I've seen doctors, I'm fine. All right. So, how we doing down there? Oh, well, we'll have lights tonight, that's for sure. What's those things around your neck? Huh? Right. Oh yeah. Forgot I had these on. It's so the military knows who I am. Like, boy my dog had one around her neck, and, in case she got lost. Yeah, just like that. We call them dog tags, they have our name and some special numbers on them. Do other people have to wear them like you do? Mmhmm. It's in case something happens to me. Like if you got hurt? Or lost? Or die? Yeah. Did you ever get afraid of dying? Sometimes. I almost did once. I'm sure glad you didn't Dean. I'm sure glad you didn't die. I guess we're all gonna die someday. This is the way things are supposed to be. My mom told me once that we should do something good while we're here. Your mom's a smart person. Yeah. I guess you must miss your mom and dad, huh? Yeah, I do. You know it's gonna be awhile before I see them again. But I'll miss 'em a whole lot while I wait. Do you miss your mom and dad? Yeah I do. Hey, you know what? What? I'd say this is the best looking yard in town. I think we deserve some cookies for all our hard work, huh? You're a really nice person, you're lots of fun too. You being here is good. I like having you as a friend. I like being here. Billy likes you being here too. Hey Buddy. Hey Billy, did I wake you? I was trying to be quiet. No, it's fine, I need to get up anyways. So what are we gonna do today? I don't know. It's just you and Dean. Yeah, just be us. You have your Christmas party tonight. Yeah, I can't wait. I think it starts around six. Hey, do you want to read me some of the story? Sure. I have a few minutes. All right. Hey you two sleepyheads. Good morning. Hey Dean. You are just in time. Great, who's up for having some breakfast first? You can read to dear sweet boy. Great. I have to go get ready for work. Okay let's read! See ya Billy. So, what are we reading? Oliver Twist. Oliver Twist. Oliver Twist. Lovely, where we at? Right there. Thank you. Yeah. When Oliver was well enough to get out of bed, Mr. Brownlow gave him a new suit of clothes. Everyone was so kind, and gentle. It was like Heaven to Oliver after his noisy, dirty life. Not long after Oliver first, not long after Olive first saw the portrait of the lady, Mr. Brownlow asked to speak to him, in his study. Dean, are you okay? Yeah, you know, I'm just tired. How 'bout we go get something to eat, huh? Okay by me. Okay, good. You coming too big brother? Thanks, I'll get some on my way out. All right, I'll have it waiting. Hey, I got everything we need for a guy's night. I got some ice cream, got some rootbeer, got a pizza. Oh, what? You being lazy now? Is your job too tough on you mister big Air Force man, huh? Oh, hey you. Hey, sorry I didn't know you were sleeping. You okay? It's okay, yeah, I was just catching up on some sleep time. Did you have one of your headaches again? No I did earlier, it's no big deal. I still think you need to see a doctor. Johnny get off to his party okay? Yeah. Somebody say something about some pizza? Oh now you're fine huh? Wherever there's food. Yeah, yeah, come in, yeah you want some? Get some, yeah, stop! Would you quit cheating? I'm not cheating, you're competitive! I'm not competitive. Well, that's my training. That hurts. Look for the weakness, think conquer. Oh yeah? You always conquer everything you go after? Well usually. - I'm sorry. - I try and I try. You know what, I'm never gonna get over this. Oh poor baby. Oh you know what, at least you've had more of an adventurous life than I've had. Oh, well. You make it sound more exciting than it is. I mean, it's not like the movies. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed do what I was doing, serving my country. But, I don't know. I guess I did get my life together. Bet you know a lot of military secrets, huh? That's right, we all know secrets. I could tell you some, but then I'd have to... So, you don't have much of a social life. Why's a guy like you still single? Who has time? What about you? Being out on missions all the time, doesn't really leave much time for the social life. And, being gone weeks or months on end, most people don't understand that. That, there's this preconceived notion that us military men are killing machines. No feelings, no emotions. Course it does make for some nice lonely times. No human interaction, so. I'm sorry I left you the way I did. My head was in a really bad place. I understand. Thought about you a lot, all the time, my best friend. I kind of figured that you probably wouldn't want to, want to talk to me. Why? So much time. People change. Well, at least you wrote me back. Yeah, yeah you got stuck here, and I went to see the world, but I wrote you a letter. I did think that maybe, I don't know, I had done something to run you off. You didn't do anything, I looked at my life here and couldn't make it work. I woulda always looked back and regretted this if I hadn't gone. Dean. I need to tell you something. I just, I don't think that I can. Just me, tell me. Whatever it is, I'll understand. Are you okay? What do you mean? Is something wrong? Yeah I'm having one of my headaches. You've been having them a lot lately, huh? Yeah I probably should be wearing my glasses. What glasses? I really think you need to see another eye doctor, get your eyes re-examined or, I don't know, a brain scan or something. You've been having this problem a lot lately, you don't think I notice? I'm just worried about you. I just get blurry sometimes, okay, I'm fine. Why won't you get help? What about work? It's only a matter of time before you screw up. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry. I just care about you. It's just been a really long time since anybody's cared about me. Even the best doctors can't do anything. What do you mean? I'm going blind, Billy. What? I'm going blind. I'm not gonna be able to see this or, you, or anything. How do you know, how do you know? You said you didn't know, that the doctors... I've know all along, okay? It wasn't my hip that got injured, it was my head. The blast did something to my head, and, you know what? I was expecting a miracle, but obviously a miracle's not in my life. I'm sorry I lied to you. I just thought that if I told you before I came, you wouldn't wanna be bothered with me. I didn't have anywhere else to go. You were always so nice to me when I was little. You remember how we first met? Yeah. Yeah, nobody wanted to play with the fat kid with acne. Except you. You always made me feel like I had a home. Now here I am, getting all emotional and everything. Some tough soldier. Can't anything be done? No, everything's been tried. I'm sorry Billy I just didn't want to let you down. You could never let me down. You're my best friend. How long? How long before? Could be a year, maybe a month. I had planned on a long career. It meant everything to me. I'm really glad you came here. Really? Yeah. You know, this is getting too sad. We're not having that pizza party like we planned. It's gonna be okay. I'm just gonna go get some more firewood, okay? You okay Billy? I'm so sorry I told you like this. I just... Dean. I have something I have to tell you. Hey, it's just me, it's okay. No, it's not okay. I have feelings, I have these feelings. I've had 'em since you've been back. They're about you. I have these feelings about you. God, I've had them since I was a kid. I know you probably don't feel the same. I don't want this to ruin our friendship. You know, Johnny really likes you. I don't want you to leave. Look Dean, I mean. Is this what you've been wanting to tell me? That you feel this way? Billy, I have loved you since I can remember. I was so afraid I could never tell you. I was, I'm just sick of living this lie. I was afraid that I'd never be able to be with you. So you feel the same, you feel the same? Oh yeah. What do we do now? You make out with a military man? Yeah, sometimes it was really exciting. We'd plan for missions, spend months on end, then you'd finally go, and really, only thing I worried about was making sure all our friends get back alive. It's funny, people say the weirdest thing. How's it jumping out of a helicopter? You like swimming ten miles a day? I was like, oh yeah, sure. Sometimes I thought I was gonna die. That could get a guy to thinking. Yeah. Of course, crying isn't something I was gonna show the military. Well, you have a lot on your plate right now. You're my best friend. And my best boyfriend I hope. Shucks. I wonder how long I'm gonna be able to lay here with you. See all this. See you. Maybe you won't go blind. Doctors are wrong all the time. Did you ever meet anyone in the military for, you know? Yeah. In my dreams. You want to get kicked out of the military quick, you let 'em know you're a homo. Besides, I wasn't about to sacrifice everything I had worked so hard for. And I saved myself for you. I remember this guy, my first year of training. Everybody just assumed he was gay. Bunch of the guys, no matter what he did, you know? They always hassled him. But he was tough, you know? He was gonna prove to everybody that he could serve his country. I always admired him for that. I tried to help out when I could but, I couldn't always be there. I remember one time we were walking back from chow and there was this guy. He was laying there, covered in blood. His teeth knocked out, his ribs broken. You could tell he put up a pretty good fight but, he lost everything. You wanna know something? In all the stuff I've seen going out on missions, and all the stuff I've done, seeing that guy laying there, beaten so badly, so alone, that was the worst I ever felt. I'm always gonna protect you. God, I miss this face. I'll tell you every day how good looking I am. This sure is a pretty Christmas tree. Sure is, Johnny. Hey guys, have room for another decorator? Hey man. Yeah, just in here bonding. What are those? Well these are for my mom and dad, and me and Billy. We always make them and put them on the tree at Christmas. Oh and these are for you. What? For you, and your mom and dad. Since you miss them like we miss our mom and dad. Johnny I... We wanted you to be on the tree with us. We wanted you and your mom and dad to be a part of the family. 'Cause you can't be with yours. Johnny. But don't worry, they know where we are. Johnny, they're beautiful, thank you. Your dog tags, why are you doing this? Well I wanted you to have them. I know you'll take care of them. But these are yours, you're the soldier, not me. I won't be needing them anymore. I wanted to pass on to a new soldier. Someone nice like you. There we go. It's time for the Christmas story, huh? Are we gonna read The Night Before Christmas? It's a great story. It's one of my favorites. Mine too. You guys ready? 'Twas the night before Christmas. 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there. The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads. And Mama and her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, had just settled down for a long winter's nap. When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow, gave the luster of midday to objects below. When what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.

The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of midday to objects below. When what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer. With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick. More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name. Now Dasher, now Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On Comet, on Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen! To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall! Now dash away, dash away, dash away all! As dry leaves that before the wild hurricanes fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky. So up to the housetop the coursers they flew, with the sleigh full of toys, and Saint Nicholas too. And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my hand and was turning around, down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot. A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, how merry. His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry. His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow. The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath. He had a broad little face and a round little belly, that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself. A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk. And laying his finger aside of his nose, and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose. He sprang to his sleigh, and his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight, Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Happy holidays. Happy holidays! See ya later, happy holidays. I'm tired of lies, and I know you love me, I love you. That's a movie star kiss. Take the tongue. Two Charlie, take one. Action. Jesus Joseph, I just saw my reflection too. I had a bad dream.

Nothing, I'll call you back. - Get off the phone. - Bye, sorry, it was my manager, I thought that was funny. It was my manager, you know, it's an important call... We had to cut anyway. Would you relax Billy? Jump in, let's catch up. Boy Billy. That's crazy. But don't worry, they know where we are. - Cut. - I'm not even saying... I know, it's just so funny, it's just. But don't worry, they know where we are. I hope they're queuing the power ballad right now. Dun dun dun!
