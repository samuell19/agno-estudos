Toko Chemical Company Shareholders' Meeting Arguments over the pollution problem. Future is uncertain. We approve bill number two! We don't agree! You're murderers! We put bill number three on the agenda en bloc. No objection! Move onto the next topic! No, we don't agree! Murderer! Objection! Carry on the proceedings! - No objection! - No! Carry on the proceedings! I see no objection. I declare the meeting closed. Mr. Owada. Our president, Lizuka, wants to entertain you tonight at the Restaurant Yanagi. Thank you, indeed. You're a great tactician. - Sir. - Oh, yes. This is for your work, in addition to the usual payment. Please accept. We hope you'll continue to help us. By the way, Mr. Lizuka, I've brought something you may be interested in. Oh, what is it? Just a few hundred fishermen paralyzed... Some victims are inevitable for the Japanese economy to bloom... But Mr. Owada... It may cause political problems. It's already been taken care of. Money makes the mare go. We gave the Chief Secretary fifty million. The Prime Minister a hundred million, the Minister Of Welfare thirty million. Thirty million to the Director of The Board Of Environment. A little more here and there. That'll be quite enough. What the hell is this? This is the conversation we had here last time. Mr. Izuka. The press will be excited to hear this. How much do you want? Add three more zeros to these figures. What? One billion yen? It's only a drop in the bucket for you, isn't it? You turned the oil panic into an opportunity for undue profits. I heard your concealed fortune is no less than hundreds of billions. I understand. The money will be ready. But I need time. One billion yen is quite a sum. Alright. Till then, I'll keep this tape in a safe place. It isn't that easy. Hold it. Your treasure may go to pieces. - Damn you! - Wait. Tsurugi, let's talk it over. You'll understand. Owada. You dug your own grave. My contract money is now tenfold for your double cross. Call me when you have the money. I'll be waiting. What the hell are you going to do? It would be terrible if that tape was made public. Do something quick! Owada Damn it. Brother, I'll get the tape back no matter what. Nonsense! Your little blackmail caused the police raid. There's no way you can beat Tsurugi. You should stay out of this. But brother... What shall we do? Are you paying Tsurugi that much? He knows the content of the tape now. There's no choice but to kill him off. Aya, you fool! Nagatomo, find a better killer. Brother. I know the very best killer. He isn't cheap, though. Who is it? Hi, I'm Shingo Yamashiro. We'll be presenting you with a shock today. Supernatural power and occult arts have been the latest boom in media. It's up to you whether you believe it or not. But the occult' is nothing new in Japan. Do you know the story of 'okaru-to-kampei'? My supernatural power was to pee on a worm to make my penis swell. Many people with supernatural powers have been on TV. But this one isn't a kid's trick like bending spoons. This is serious. Very terrifying and exciting. Don't miss the experiment we're showing you now. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Black, the king of miracles! This chain is twenty-three millimeters in diameter. Look how strong this chain is. One... Two... Aw, the chisel is bent, but the chain hasn't broken! Mr. Black can cut it without touching it. Do you believe it? Do you believe it? Watch carefully everyone. Mr. Black, please! He did it! He did it! What amazing powers! Did you see it? I saw it with my own eyes! Terrific. Is this the guy you were talking about? Yes, I met him while I was in the states. He used to be one of the best killers of the Chicago mafias. But, Aya... You can't underestimate Tsurugi. He's beyond the control of the mafia. A real scoundrel. Don't worry. I hold an ace card for the game. There are people who say they can make the impossible possible. But he says, they talk nonsense. He's trying hard! He says, "Challenge me, if you dare!". "I'll shame you in public." What? I'll be an assistant to the new killer? Don't make me a fool. We've already paid you. I won't do any job that disgraces me. Here's your money back. Wait! Owada. You'd better think twice before attacking Tsurugi. A hundred of these chicken guys won't do. - Bitch! - Stop there! Hello? Mr. Tsurugi? Speaking. I just got a message for you from a Miss Aya Owada. She wants to see you at the magic flute at midnight. She'll wear a cattleya flower. Thank you. Mr. Tsurugi, hold on. Why don't we go out? We got paid today. Let me treat you. Thanks for your invitation. Unfortunately, as I look like Dracula, I'd better not go out. Let's stay as we are. Hey, Kimiko! How was it? What did he say? He doesn't want to go out because he looks like Dracula. - Shall we dance? - No, thanks. Why not? Come on. You have a nice body. No, don't! You're here looking for a man, aren't you? It'll be midnight soon. Cinderella shouldn't be out alone. Wait! Dance with me, just once, please. You must be Mr. Tsurugi. I recognized your voice. You're just the man I'd expected. You're so handsome. Go home, my child. No, I won't. A little more. Take me somewhere. You're not the girl for Dracula. Your pure blood will be stained. What's the matter? Are you alright? You're two minutes late. Where is the money? Surely you're not paying with this. Have you brought the tape? Right here. Let's go somewhere to make a deal. It's not a bad idea to get to know each other. You bet. You're a woman for Dracula. Do you want to take a shower first or take a short cut? Either. As you wish. Take off this flimsy thing. I feel excited tonight. Because of that cinderella girl or me? Neither. Because of one billion yen perhaps. It sounds like you. Good. Who is this? I'm Kimiko from the telephone service. I'm busy right now. Tsurugi. Listen! I have your cinderella. If you want to save her, then bring the tape to Korakuen Park. OK. Wait a minute. Who are you? What's going on? Cinderella was kidnapped. Our game has to be suspended. Leave the girl alone. She's got nothing to do with you. - That's why it makes it worse. - No! Don't leave me like this! No! Let go of me. No, never. Laser beam! Is this your supernatural power? Hi, grilled chicken! I've cut ties with Owada. Shall we team up? Fool! It's ten years too early for you. Get out of my way. To be honest, I admire your skills. For you, I can tolerate being an assistant. I don't need a partner. I'll be of great help, you know. Damn it. Who are you? Tsurugi. You must know, as a karate man, I've bound this girl by use of lightning kill. You have thirty seconds to resuscitate her. You dirty scum! Where's the tape? Here. Let me hear it played back. It's already been taken care of. Money makes the mare go. We gave the Chief Secretary fifty million. The Prime Minister a hundred million... OK. Give it to me! You're pretty good. Who are you? Where was your school? Wait! Damn you! You've been shadowing me. Is it because your body's too hot? Don't be so vulgar. I know you're from a very decent family. You're wasting your time. The tape's gone. It was stolen. - Was it the man who called you? - Yes. - Who is he? - It have no idea. I don't believe this. This is shameful for your reputation. I'll get it back. Then, I'll make a deal with your brother. A hundred million yen, cash. Tell him to get it ready. If you betray me again, I'll kill you all. We'll have a date after I get the money. Wait till then. The Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office Kunigami, this is Mr. Kuroda, Chief Secretary of the Democrats. Kunigami is a prosecutor. How do you do? How do you do? By the way, I've heard that you sent a writ of summons to the president of the Toko Chemical Company. Yes, I want to hear all the details from him as a witness. Why didn't you tell me first? I didn't think I had to. Listen. He's a bigwig in the financial world. His company is one of the largest corporations in Japan. He has a huge influence on society. You should be more cautious. But, we suspect him of bribing in political circles. I'm very convinced of it. Do you have any evidence? Pardon me for asking, but what does it have to do with you? Mr. Kuroda's here because of your writ of summons to the Toko Chemical Company. He wants to know the reasons behind it. I see. I only sent it this morning. You have quick ears. Kunigami. About this case, from now on I'll be in charge directly. The case is obviously too big for an inexperienced prosecutor like you. Withdraw the writ of summons. Then bring me all the relevant documents. Let's discuss it after that. Kunigami, I admire your high spirits, but don't overdo it. The judiciary is separate from administration, but you are working for The Bureau Of Judicial Affairs. Understand? Kunigami. You're a mere prosecutor. Think carefully, otherwise you'll regret it. So, you're a prosecutor? Well done for finding that out. I make the impossible possible. Really? I won't let anyone use my tape. Give it back to me. Follow me. Tsurugi. I won't give the tape to anyone. Not to my boss, nor to you, of course. Stop this nonsense. It's mine. I warned you to keep away from this case. I can move the police easily like my own hands and feet. Are you threatening me? It's a piece of advice. Oh, thanks. Go home. Your skills aren't good enough to beat me yet. You know it, don't you? That surely is a unique style. I've never had an actual match, but I guess it's the Kunigami School. Kunigami School? An ancient Okinawa style. The form you did must be the "Big Tsunami". "Big Tsunami"? That's all I can say now. But come with me. I'll demonstrate the oldest Okinawa forms. What do you say? These are Yara School forms. You must have found some tricks against "Big Tsunami". Tsurugi, you are a genius, but you've been involved in too many scuffles. Your mind is not clear. Your late father would be sad to see you like that. Open your inner eyes! Soldier! Soldiers, please! Listen to me, please! - Shut up! - Daddy isn't a spy. Let him go. Please. Brat! You are the son of a traitor. Get lost. Daddy! Daddy... Takuma. Don't trust anybody. You are the only one you can turn to. Train yourself, your body and your mind. Don't let anybody get the better of you. Mister! What are you doing here? You might catch a cold. Tsurugi! Damn you! I'm a busy man, you see. I don't waste time. You're playing foul. Playing foul? You used the lightning kill trick on the girl. Takera! What's happened? Takera! What happened to him? His stopped breathing after a karate trick. Get him to the hospital, or he'll be dead in five minutes. What are you doing? Madam. Where does he usually keep his treasure? Be quick or he'll be dead. It's urgent. Room eight hundred ten, Grand Heights. Get some oxygen ready! In five minutes. Takera! pull yourself together. Takera! Takera! Get hold of yourself, Takera! It's already been taken care of. Money makes the mare go. We gave the Chief Secretary 50 million. The Prime Minister a hundred million, Thirty million to the Minister Of Welfare. Thirty million to the Director of The Board Of Environment. Tsurugi. You're amazing. Hats off to you! Time to say farewell to you all. Grilled chicken! Get away! I can't see anything. Damn witch! I told you not to underestimate me. I'll keep this. Didn't you say that you admire my skills? A hundred million yen can change my mind. Damn! How do you like this, Tsurugi? You can never get away. Let's have your funeral. Tsurugi, our game has to be shelved. Don't go! You'll be killed. I fell for you. I'd rather die first. Don't go! Stop it! Tsurugi! Toko Chemical Company Excuse me, but you must be Mr. Owada. Yes. And you are? This is my card. A prosecutor? What do you need me for? I have something to ask you. It won't take much time. Could you please come with me? What is it? Have you found my missing brother? No. He's such a fool. I would never dream that he was doing wrong like a gangster. I don't believe you. Mr. Owada. You were the one pulling his wire. I have the evidence. Pardon? Here are the affidavits of the sufferers of your threats and of your brother's employees. And this tape. I have enough evidence. The tape is the same as the one you got back from Tsurugi. I made a copy. Mr. Owada. You asked for one billion yen for this. I've heard that the money will arrive in your account tomorrow. Wait! I don't know what you're talking about. One billion yen is wild talk. Owada! Someone like you shouldn't be making excuses now. Well, when you get that money take half and go abroad. What? I'll take the other half. Toko Chemical Company won't be able to claim for the dirty money. I'll withhold the prosecution until you get away. Mr. Owada, it's so rare to commit such a perfect and safe crime. Did you plan all this from the beginning? No, I wavered to be honest. Should I act for social justice, or should I be a millionaire? The pressures from the political circles and my boss made me do this. After all, with them my efforts for justice may be futile. I'd rather have material gain. Mr. Owada. I may be a prosecutor, but I don't have an elite university degree or any connections. I'll end up being a second-rate lawyer after my retirement. Must I go abroad? I'm sorry... But you're not very important in this case, so no one will help you. If you stay in Japan you'll be arrested, sooner or later. Mr. Kunigami... You're a real ruffian. You win. Thank you. A message from our Owada to your boss. Wishing you all the best for the future of Toko Chemical Company. A police bike! It must be for your speeding! What shall we do? Could it be Tsurugi? Tsurugi? He's dead. But we didn't find his dead body. And he's good at disguising as a policeman. Pull over. You're exceeding the speed limit. Why us? What about the other cars? Both of your cars have to follow me. You'll be in trouble for taking us to this kind of place. Don't you think so, Mr. Cop? You have another hour to live. Seigan Owada must be waiting for the money. I'll keep the money. Tell them to come to the Aoidani Crematorium. You'd better hurry or you'll die! When are you leaving? I've booked a flight tomorrow. I might settle down in Brazil. That's not a bad idea. Good luck. The same to you. I'll lead a dull life as usual. They're late. It's been two hours since they left the bank. There they are. - Hold on! - Please send for a doctor. What happened? We were attacked by Tsurugi. What? He's alive and took the money. To get the money back he said you have to go to the Aoidani Crematorium. Kunigami, what shall we do? He wants revenge, not money. There is no choice but to kill him. I need your help. He already knows that you are with us. It was your mistake not to confirm his death. You have to pay for it. I'll be at home waiting for the good news. Aya! Go get black. He's still at the hotel. Hey you, wait! Hold it. It was too cruel. Damn you! Forgive me. As they say, you have nine lives. Wonderful. I was very glad to hear you're alive. I really mean it. You must know how I feel about you. Come to my house, please? That's not a bad idea. I'm happy, Tsurugi. Let's run away with the money. I'll go anywhere with you. You're not going to kill me, are you? Tsurugi, don't you like me? Don't you want my body? To be honest, you've got a superb body. I'll do anything for you. Even be your slave. So, please. Don't kill me. Don't you remember that I never forgive double crossing? I wonder if my brother got him. I don't know. Aya, didn't you have feelings for Tsurugi? Of course not. I hate those kinds of ruffians. Is that how you see me? I'm not that cheap. I know. Love doesn't mean anything to you... Compared to the power of money. Where are we going? To the Shonan Marina. The Shonan Marina? My yacht is ready. We are sailing for Hong Kong tonight. What about the flight tomorrow? I lied to Kunigami. Why would I give five hundred million yen to such a selfish petty official? That's my brother. Hey! Boss, the weather is too rough. It's too difficult to go out to sea tonight. They say it'll clear up tomorrow. Take the things in, Sakuragi. This storm upsets the plan. How did you get here? I know you're clever. I've been watching you, knowing you would do this. I'm a prosecutor. I can't let you sneak out of the country. Sakuragi! Who is it? - What was that? - Go and see. Who are you? Damn you! Fuck you! Help me! Young lady! I'm going to Hong Kong on behalf of Owada. Will you follow your brother... or me? Who do you choose? I'll go with you. When are we leaving? We must say goodbye. Why? Aw, don't! What are you doing? Don't you know that I can read your mind? Drink it. You're here. You're dirtier than Owada or anyone else. But I'll have a fair fight with you as a martial artist. Are you ready for it? Come on! OK. Tsurugi, I won't let you kill me. I don't want to die. I'll survive with the money. Stop! Don't go! Stop! Don't go! Come back! Get out! I said, get out! Aya! What a fool! What a fool! The End
