THIS SUMMER FEELING Sasha. Do you want to sit down? FIVE DAYS LATER Hey. Thanks. Hi, David. Lawrence just got here. Your parents are upstairs? Yes, they're resting. It was hell last night with mom. We couldn't calm her down. This morning, she spoke to a doctor friend. He confirmed, you know, the diagnosis. Or, at least, he didn't find it... That made it easier for them. It was a good idea, her calling. I said I'd wake them at 11. There's stuff to do for the repatriation of the urn. Do you want me to stay and help with anything? No, it's fine. I think I'll go back to bed, catch up on some sleep. And Sasha's friends all went home to Paris? Most of them, except Anouk. The others couldn't stay overnight. - Your sister flew back to New York? - Yes. Yesterday, as well. I think it's better that way. I'd better go or I won't get any sleep. See you later then. Later. I never got around to asking. How's Nils? He's good. But you asked me already. I did? I even gave you a picture Nils drew for you. I honestly don't remember. I don't even know where I put it. He'll do you another, don't worry. I left him with my parents on the way here. It's complicated. He's only little. Yes, of course. Lawrence? You must be Lawrence. Do you speak German? Zoé? Where are we meeting Lawrence? At the restaurant? No, he said he'd... He's coming here and we'll all go together. - He'll meet us here. - I see. Anouk, thanks for staying. We appreciate it. Truly. No, I'm very happy that you're not bored. That's good, sweetheart. I'll call you tomorrow, okay. Well? He's fine. He wasn't in bed? Now I've said goodnight, he'll sleep. Little monster. How old's Nils now? - Six? - Nearly seven. As I said yesterday, Vladimir and I insist that you keep all you two had in the apartment. It goes without saying, if you're okay with it. If it's not too much clutter. Anything you want to give away or prefer to get rid of, I understand. Anyway, we'll be back in Berlin soon to finish the paperwork, so tell us then. There's no rush. We consider that all Sasha's belongings belong to you. We have no intention of dispossessing you of anything or encroaching on your shared space. We also want you to have Sasha's savings. It's not much, obviously, but every little helps, with the rent for example. - Dad! - What's up? Am I rambling? Did I say something stupid? So you're doing more and more translation work? Yes, I work with the... Always for the same publisher. Mostly. They're letting off steam. He came to see me, in fact. I'm really not sleepy. One for the road maybe? Sure, good idea. I don't know if... Lawrence... You know a place we can go? Sure, why not? I think I'll turn in. Yes, I'll head back too. - Thanks for everything. - No problem. See you. Goodbye. ONE YEAR LATER See that? It looks like steam. Or mist. It's pretty. C'mon, jump! Where'd you get that? A gift. Look at Charles and Bill. They obviously like a drop or two. What do you mean, like a drop or two? They look a bit... Look a bit what? A drop or two of alcohol. They're bright red, they've got... The conks on them. Anyway... Now, seriously... Does your character have a mustache? I don't think so. Don't think so? Silly! Does he or doesn't he? The two alkies in the trash! My turn. Is your character Georges? You have to ask general question to start with. Like is it a boy or a girl? It's a girl? No, not a girl. Not many girls in this game. Does he have a hat? Yes. I know. It's Bernard. Nils, that's just stupid. You said it was a man. That's a woman, you cheat! Look, you can see it's a woman. Long hair, lipstick... - He's trying to con you too? - Totally. He makes up the rules as he goes along. So I see. Yet another gift. He's spoilt rotten. My dad gave him my old games. He can't get over having a grandson. I'd have preferred a girl. Anyways... I'll be going. He's eaten. Pumpkin. You don't want to stay over? No, I'm going home. Sure? Yes, I have lots to do. It's up to you. You bastard. Got one for me? Here. Thanks. What did you do today? I lazed around. And I saw Anouk. We had lunch together. How is she? Fine, I guess. A bit hyper, as usual. Lawrence is coming to Paris. Isn't it weird he didn't let us know? I don't know. Maybe he will. I don't think so. I get the feeling he's cut himself off. Anouk said it's been hard for him recently. More than at the beginning. I suspected something was wrong. I emailed him a while ago. His reply was pretty weird. Kind of terse. He'll be at Anouk's party Saturday. Maybe I won't go now. How come? Maybe he doesn't want to see me. Sure he does. For sure. Zoé? Can't you sleep? The living room's loud. All the noise from the street. I know. Hey, William. How are you? I'm good. - Everything okay? - Great. Hello there. - How's it going? - Fine. And you? Sleep well? Pretty well. Your son said you got to bed at noon. I'm out of whack just now. - You too, I guess? - Less than you. Going out already? Yes, I have a date. You never sit with me now. You're bored? No, you know... We never talk, you're always coming or going. Next week, I'm all yours. I promise. Anything happen tonight? Nothing special. A Swiss couple in room 15 for two nights. Did you see the stuff your son printed out? I put it in the top drawer. - What is it? - Nothing much. Social Security bombarding me with emails. You'll be okay? Don't worry. You can run along. Be good then. Glad you could come. Lawrence is here! Give me your jacket. - It's great to see you. - Same here. - When did you arrive? - Yesterday. I planned to call you but Anouk said you were coming. It's fine this way, no worries. You're still working at the hotel? Every month, I tell myself I'll quit and I've been there four years. How about we go outside? It's stifling here. Sure. Hey. - How are you? - Good. So, how are you doing? You're writing right now? I kind of put it on standby. I'm doing more and more translations. A lot, in fact. French, English... Some Italian too. Pity. I really liked Glass Arcade. You did? Famous Mr. Adekine! Famous, I'm not so sure. Anouk told me it was tough for you recently. You should have told us, dropped us a line. Anyway, I'd have... I'd have liked that. I know but... It was hard for you guys too, right? Anyway, things are looking up. I'm even starting to think about moving. Total revolution. June kept on my case for months to get me to check out the ads. What do you know, I did. Nils is doing okay? Great. He's at his father's. You know, we're sort of separated right now, me and David. Yes, I know. I live at a friend's. She's in Montreal for a year. Is it okay with you if I contact David? No problem. Call him. He asked after you the other day. He did? Sure. Over here for a toast! We're coming. What will you do now? Catch the next one, it's cool. I can wait with you if you want. Get home to bed, you're ready to drop. Say hi to your folks for me, won't you? Of course I will. It was great seeing you. Keep in touch. I will. Goodbye. Adèle? It's us. Hello! What a big boy! Coming through. You had a good trip, both of you? Fine. We nearly missed the train. Got there at the last second. Nils, say goodnight. It's time for bed. Zoé, I'm going to bed. Me too, in a moment. If you need a towel or anything, help yourself. No, I have all I need. Give me a goodnight hug then. I'm glad you came, you know. I know. I'm glad too. Sleep well. You too. Goodnight. - Is the water warm? - Very warm. It's wonderful. Go take a dip. There's never usually so many. As long as they don't crash land on us. David's okay? Yes, David is okay. Shame he didn't come. What does "shame" mean? I don't know, it's a shame. Dad, you realize that's an outrageous thing to say? Why not? You don't have to share a bedroom. I won't even bother replying. You're out of your mind. Have it your way. It's just a shame. A shame I don't want to discuss. We won't. Have it your way. I'm going to test the miraculous waters. How about you stay with granddad? I want to swim and you can't keep up with me. Please, champ. Nils, let's play a game. How about we get an ice cream? You can have lemon, apricot, coconut, raspberry, strawberry, chocolate or vanilla. Gonna walk on your head. Got you! Okay, you win. I'm beat. Look, isn't it beautiful! Normal. Too fat. Clothes. What kind of bears are they? Polar bears, I guess. They're white all over. Dad! Is mom okay? Fine. Just a bit tired. She's rested and she'll be down soon. Come here. You go downstairs with Vladimir. I won't be long. Mom... Don't get too worried about your mom. She's feeling better, really. With summer coming back, it hits her. But she's much better. I don't know if she said, she started seeing a kind of psychiatrist two months ago. No, I didn't know. He's not really a psychiatrist, more a guy who treats imbalances through the feet. By massaging her feet. You're kidding me? I know. I found it weird at first, but what the heck. Thérèse recommended him. Dear Lawrence, The other night, you asked for a memory of Sasha. A funny memory. There are so many but they seemed banal, not typically Sasha. One just occurred to me, a moment she and I shared. Right, here goes. Don't laugh. I must've been 17, so Sasha was 22. It was a trip we went on together to Edinburgh for the street festival in August. It was one of our few trips together. We weren't the best traveling companions. Anyway, we'd booked a cheap hotel out of town, run by some Pakistanis. One night, we were woken by the fire alarm going off. We dashed out in our panties to see what was going on. As soon as the door slammed behind us, the alarm stopped. We were the only two idiots who got up. Nobody else had stirred. So there we were, half-naked in the hallway, locked out. We couldn't get the door open. Sasha was losing it, like, "You go. No way I'm going downstairs like this." In the end, she sacrificed her dignity. She went down in panties, hands over her chest. The receptionist's eyes popped out. He came up to open the door. I can still see Sasha there hiding her boobs. It was surreal. We couldn't stop giggling and the Pakistani was blushing, curling up in embarrassment. It was so funny, we snapped photos in the hallway and room as a souvenir. Sasha called them our hooker shots. Two stupid girls. There you go. I told you not to laugh. Here in Annecy, we're thinking of you. I hope you're well. Zoé. Two beers. Thanks. - Hello. - Good evening. No, I dropped by to see Zoé. I thought she was working tonight. She starts later today. You can wait for her, if you want. - And you are? - Lawrence, a friend of hers. Yes, indeed. Wait here, she won't be long. Take a seat. Someone's been in my room again. Searching everywhere. The bathroom even. No, honestly, the bathroom... If something's moved, the maid must have shifted it to clean. Besides her, nobody enters the rooms. I always leave my suitcase open. When I got back, the lid was shut. Even the furniture's been moved. - But nothing's missing? - I've no idea. If you'd feel better, I'll come up later and we'll take a look together. Tomorrow, we'll check everything is in its rightful place. I'll be there to check, if you want. - Yes, I'd like that. - Okay then. Always the same with her. Feeling better? I thought you'd gone back to Berlin. I stayed on in the end. I'm finding it hard to go back. Sorry, I feel kind of mixed up, in fact. - I was dumb coming here. - You weren't. It was anything but dumb. I'm glad to see you. I need some air. Go out in the courtyard there, if you want. Can you stay here? Of course I can. Can you help me? Feels like I'll never get over this. How do you do it? How? I don't know. Hey, Nils. How's things? Good. Wait till it shuts, when you hear a click, or else it's cheating. Close the door. Nearly. - I won! - No way, we got here first. - I did win. - No, you did well. Last time, you were one floor behind. It's funny seeing the square from this angle. You know, first time I came to Paris, I stayed in this neighborhood. Really? I always found it a bit weird. I like it. I'm used to it, I guess. Why'd you come to Paris? To discover art. Something like that. Very naive. And to get out of New York a bit. It seems so far away now. A whole different life. Thanks for the guided tour. You're gonna win. You're a great basketball player. Do you play with a club or... No, I play with my friends. At school. You sleep over here? No, dad's picking me up later. Is mommy your girlfriend? She's a girl-friend. Does she live with you? We don't live in the same place. She's a good friend, like your dad. I live in another country, in Germany. You know where Germany is? ONE YEAR LATER - They let you in? - Yes. - But it was tricky. - I know. - Welcome. - Thank you. I've got Nina's car. He's piled on the pounds. She has, yes. Yes, the old lady seems to enjoy America. She's piling on the years too. June told me she's nearly 12 now. She doesn't miss her? It's odd giving your cat away. It kind of suited her. You know June, she's always... bouncing around. When she dropped by here, they celebrated their reunion. Seriously. She didn't want to leave her. That's a fabulous photo. I never saw it before. Yes, I really like it. It used to be in our study in Berlin. She looks so young. I doubt you'll need it, but just in case. Put it here? Goodnight. Sleep well. It's really nice here. I like it a lot too. It's one of my favorite neighborhoods. In Manhattan, at least. When do you head to Tennessee? Tomorrow night. I'd love to drop by on the way back, if that's okay. No problem. I've never been to Tennessee. Who are you seeing there? A guy I was at college with. We've always stayed in touch more or less. He kept inviting me to visit. It seemed kind of crazy, but I thought, go for it. I had no plans this summer. There was no reason to say no. What are they playing? I think it's called handball. My turn to show you my city from up above. What about your parents? They okay? I got an email from your mother last month. She said they'd done lot of work on the yard and house in Annecy. Yes, they had a sudden impulse. Actually, I think it was mom... who took charge. I don't think dad was too keen on the whole idea. It was a pretext, I think, to stay down there. She's taking horticulture lessons too. Horticulture? - Great. - Picture that. If you want, tonight, I told a friend I'd meet her in a cool bar I know. If you want. I mean, you don't have to drag me around with you. You have your own life. It's no problem. You've got the key? Hi, mom. Can't you hear me? Sure, I can hear you fine. Yes, it's going great. Not yet. I'm at Lawrence's. We went out with some friends, but I was tired so I came home. Yes, sunny and hot. And you two? All okay? Great. Is Nils around? Let him play. Sure. Honestly, don't bother them. Just tell him I'll call tomorrow and that I send my love and I miss him. Both of you too, I miss you all. Fine, mom. Honestly, everything's fine. I'll call you back tomorrow, okay? Lots of love, all my love. Big kiss. Can you hold this a second? - What time's your flight? - 6:25. - We're okay for time? - Sure. By the way, I wanted to say... I haven't told my parents yet but... I think David and I will get a divorce. We've decided. Really? I pictured you living like that forever. Together and not together. I know. Nobody really understands. Me neither, in fact. You know, David was very important... I mean, he'll always be very important to some extent. And I'll always love him. We met at a time when I felt so feeble. Everything frightened me. He was so reassuring. But it's complicated. I can't explain it, I get all muddled up. I think I understand. That explains Tennessee. I guess it does. I hope it's not a total disaster. Maybe I'm out of my mind. I haven't seen him for years. Most likely, he's obese and... a fan of bison hunting. - Watch out. - You idiot. There are no bison in Tennessee. That makes it even creepier. You'll have a great time, I'm sure. If you want to come back to New York early, feel free. I appreciate it. It was good to see you. Take good care of yourself. Thank you. See you. Soon.
