Howdy, there. Good morning. Hey, I wonder what this alfalfa desperado's got in them boxes? - I'm not a farmer. - My mistake. What are you then? I'm a businessman. Where are you from? I was born in Europe. So that's why you talk like that. Hey, this stuff looks costly. Come over here and look at this. Don't open any more boxes, please. Get down, now! Now! If you haven't figured by now, we're gonna be taking your wagon and your supplies. Your friend is bleeding. You should help him. Don't follow me. Good afternoon, sir. I don't mean to intrude on your day. You're not. Would you be so kind to direct us to the sheriff office? Tell you what, I'll take you there myself, Marshal. That would be greatly appreciated. You look very familiar. You sure? Not many look like me. That's true. Are you sure we haven't met before? Don't think so, let's go. Now, here's where I think we should expand first. Build right there. Huh? Maybe a new school, so we don't have to keep using the church. We could do that, but there aren't that many children in Blind Chapel yet. The church works fine for their schooling. I think we should consider the expense of expansion, Sheriff. That's why I'm thinking about a sporting house, a nice sized one, hire lots of girls. That way we have a sporting house that gets real big in the territory, draws a big crowd every night. Huh? A lot better money in that. The church-going folk ain't gonna like that, Mayor. They will when their wallets get fattened. Trust me, Sheriff. Ivan, what can I do for you? This man needs to speak to you, Sheriff. I'm Marshal Austin Carter, pleased to meet you, Sheriff. Sheriff Vernon Kelly. This is Mayor Bowman. This is Deputy Walker, our prisoner, Ethan Crawley. We are escorting him to the town of San Antonio to face trial for mass murder. I heard of him. I've heard of Ethan Crawley, too. Why'd you bring this fiend to our town, Marshal? To be honest with you, I've been riding for quite a while, all night. The deputy and I would like to get a meal and maybe a couple hours of rest. Sheriff, if you don't mind, we'd like to keep our prisoner in your jail during that time. Not a chance. This man's a leader of the Hellhound Gang, a bunch of cutthroats. They're monsters, ghouls, even cannibals. They used to ride with the Quantrill Raiders, killer of men, women, and children. They used to burn down entire towns. That's all we need to know. Now just a damn minute, Mayor. I'm not gonna be some coffee boiler for a sheriff. The law gets respect in this office. You can lock your prisoner up here. Greatly appreciated, Sheriff. Do you have any idea what you just did? My job. Crawley ain't going nowhere. I'll keep a keen eye on him. You better pray nothing bad happens. - Your job depends on it. - Oh, yeah? Who you gonna run against me, Mayor? Everybody listen up. No one breathes a word of this to any of our citizens. Is that understood? You son of a Jezebel. Thank you. We didn't mean to get you in trouble, Sheriff. Don't worry about Mayor Bowman. I'm used to him pitching a fit, he's always like this. Not always, sometimes he's worse. Being that this town is so close to the Rio Bravo line, one might assume it's got a border name. That's what I thought when I first arrived here. How to get to be being called Blind Chapel? Hell, I ain't never even heard of it. I've been told the town's first preacher was snake bitten, and went blind. He died a few days later. The townfolk named town Blind Chapel, in tribute to him. 'bout the preacher? We have a new one now. What's troubling you, Marshal? Your mayor is a little bit excited. Yeah, everything he said about Ethan Crawley and his gang is true. They're the most vile collection of miscreants one could imagine. And I can guarantee they're gonna want their leader returned. As you could assume, we're just a little distrustful of our environment at all times. You know a place where we can dine and repose? Right there, the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. And the meal is free, as long as you order a beer. Oh, I think we could do that. Will you join us, sir? As long as you call me Ivan. I can do that, Ivan. If this ain't the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had, then I don't know what is. It might be kind to your digestion if you ate a little bit slower. Aw, hell Marshal. I could eat off the same plate as a rattler and my gut would be just fine. Where are you from, originally? La France. You seem to be an educated man. Where did you study, Ivan? Military academy. That's impressive. Myself, I was homeschooled by my mother, and I can tell you she was a stickler about education. What about your father? He was shot dead by a drunken man. I was nine. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you. Tell you the truth, that's what gave me the motivation to become a lawman. By the way, how did you manage to catch Crawley? Well, mostly luck. I got tipped off by a whorehouse boss that Crawley had the lustful urge for one of his ladies. We went there and recognized the two guys in front of his bedroom door. We sent both of them in the boneyard. That we did. And we caught Crawley naked in bed, and we placed him under arrest. You should have seen the old nanny he was with. She looked like the hind end of a buzzard. She did. How is everything? Ma'am, if you fix these biscuits and gravy, I'd like to ask you to marry me. Our cook is actually an old, grouchy man, who drinks too much whiskey. And I'm sorry, but he's already spoken for. Well. How is your day, Arlene? No complaints, but I'd like to see you in here more often. Would you like anything else? I think we done. Thanks, Arlene. Have you seen Vernon today? I'm thinking about bringing him some supper. I think you should wait till little later, Jenny, he's busy at the moment. What's going on, Sheriff? These men are Pinkerton agents. Hello, Marshal. We're here to escort your prisoner, Ethan Crawley, the rest of the way to the San Antonio prison. Do you mind if I see your paperwork? Not at all. Here. Our orders. How did you know Crawley was in Blind Chapel? Marshal here telegraphed us from Grand Ridge and asked for our assistance. We figured the Marshal and his deputies would be to your town by now. It is true. I telegraphed a request for assistance from the Pinkerton Agency. But I thought that you would meet us on the trail before we reached the town of Blind Chapel. Plans change. I'm not going to release my prisoner until we reach the town of San Antonio. No problem, we'll ride together. Help! I'll shoot her. I'm gonna shoot this bitch, I swear. I told you Crawley's gang was coming back, didn't I? This is just the beginning, mark my words! They know he's here, and they're coming back. This is your fault. Your mayor, he's a strange bird, but he's right about one thing. If my Hellhounds return to free me, you are all gonna be buzzard food. You shut your mouth. Vernon, shoot Crawley if he tries anything, okay? I'll do exactly that, Ivan. Ivan, I heard shooting, what happened? - We need Doc Adams. - He left about a half hour ago to make some house calls outside of town. Then you will help us, Nora. Put him here. You're hurt, too. - I'm fine. - No, you're not. Sit down, Marshal. How is he? Nora? I can't help him. What do you mean? I'm no doctor let alone a surgeon, but he--he's too far gone. There's nothing to be done? Is there any way we can get him to the doctor? Would he make it? I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Deputy Dennis Walker was a good man. He was a loyal friend, and a great deputy. You'll be missed, my friend. Please, sit down, Marshal. Please. It looks like the bullet just tore through the flesh and nothing more, but you're bleeding badly. I need to close that wound. Here, drink this. It'll numb the pain. Go on. How do you feel? It works pretty fast. Take hold of the Marshal. It's important he keeps still. Got it. Lookie here. Excuse me, Captain. The colonel is still in Blind Chapel. What the hell happened? I was watching from across the street. Everything seemed fine at first. Your two men had the Pinkerton gear and the papers, and got inside the sheriff's office, as you planned. There was also the Sheriff, a Marshal and his deputy and, well... Well what, woman? Well, there was also this big German, or Russian, biggest son of a bitch I've ever seen. Then something occurred, I could not see what, but your two men draw down on them. Looked like Jackson was first, but this big German or Russian went batshit crazy. Both your men are dead. I was lucky he did not see me. I might have been dead too. Son of a bitch. Thanks, Daniela. Tell the girls down at the whorehouse we'll be down to see 'em real soon. Here's a little bonus for you. Esta bien, gracias. God damn it. Did you lie to me, Pinkerton man? Did you lie to me about who you was gonna meet? Now you said you was gonna meet the Marshal, and deputy, and the sheriff. Is that right? So who's this big Russian or German son of a bitch? I don't know. - No? - No. How about I cut your goddamn pecker off? No! Please, I don't know anything. Please don't. I swear I don't know anything. You don't know anything? You are no good to me at all. - Okay. - Sir? Cut him loose. Get up. Get up! - Come on, boy. - Give him a knife. Sir. Pick it up, you yellow Yankee bastard. Pick it up or I'll kill you where you stand. Back up, boys. Look at me. I must say, nurse Nora, you do meticulous work. Thank you, Marshal. But I'm not really a nurse. I just have some experience from the war, that and watching the doctor at work. I never seen anyone being so accurate with a handgun. I had some training, Marshal. Just some? - A lot. - That's it. Now I remember. It was during the war when we were introduced. Nora, may I present to you, Union Brigadier General, John Basil Turchin. What's he talking about, Ivan? I'm talking about how no one can hold a candle to this man in courage. He saved our hides twice from the Confederate army in Chickamauga. Sergeant Austin Carter, Third Division. It's an honor to see you again, General. Is that all true, Ivan? It was war, Nora. - I had a job to do. - You were a general? - Yes. - How come you never told anyone in town about it? I was a soldier then. The war is over. Yes, but a General? That's all anyone in Blind Chapel needs to know, Nora. Samuel, where are you? I'm coming. What is it, Ivan? You got the bodies from the shootout already. Yeah, some locals and I did. Why, what's wrong with that? Did you find any personal belongings on them? No. You're sure about that? Sir, are you accusing me of thievery? Do I have to, Samuel? Do you know how hard it is to make money at this job? Hardly no one dies around here. Did you find anything or not? Nothing valuable. That's not what I ask you, Samuel. I'll be cow kicked. Where is it? Here. Nothing more than that, except a few gold teeth. You can keep the teeth, Samuel. Thank you, that's so nice of you. Where are they? Blasted teeth. Here, now, I-- May I keep-- Have a good day. Get that whiskey. I brought you late breakfast, Vernon. Is this a bad time? No, it isn't, this is fine, Jenny. It's your favorite. Sure is. How are things over at the palace? The gunfire slowed business down for a bit, but it's picked up since then. I'm glad to hear it. I know how hard you work. So do you, you're the hardest working man I know. I can't wait to dig in. Mm, delicious. - Is it warm enough? - It is. Well, well, well, isn't that something? The sheriff and the painted lady, fancy each other. You shut your damn mouth. She ain't no painted lady. Don't pay attention to that pole cat. Did all that shooting earlier interrupt your business, whatever shady business that might have been? Anyway, that's nothing compared to what's gonna happen. Just ask your lovey man over there. You're all gonna be in a peck of trouble, huh? What's he mean by that? What he means is he's gonna get my boot up his maggot ass unless he shuts his fucking mouth. Vernon! Sorry for my temper, Jenny. But that deuce can't be believed for nothing. I know the type of men like that. Speaking of men, I heard of Vernon Kelly, but he was a hard case. He was mean enough to steal a coin from a dead man's eye. And he was so quick to pull his fucking iron, Jenny, and he had a Colt just like your man over there. Have you ever heard of him? I have heard of that Vernon Kelly. And I know for a fact he changed his ways and became a good man. And now he's on the right side of the law. Yeah. That's exactly what he's doing. You two ought to charge for that show. What's the matter with you people? You didn't hear the gunfight earlier? You think everything is right as rain now? Ethan Crawley is sitting in our jail, and his notorious, bloodthirsty Hellhound Gang are gonna come to our town and free him. If you wanna stay here and get slaughtered, that's fine with me, but I recommend you leave town, you board up your businesses and you hide. Now let's go! It all appears legitimate. Which means Crawley's gang captured the Pinkerton agents you were expecting. And they made them talk. And that's how they deduced we would be in Blind Chapel. - Yes. - Perhaps I should take Crawley right now, and cut a path to San Antonio. You wouldn't make it, they would get you. Does this town have a telegraph office? It's presently not working. Would any of the town folks be willing to assist us? I don't know. Nothing like this has ever happened here before. What's that? Bless you. Good to see you, Alice. Take shelter, everyone. - What's going on, preacher? - Haven't you heard? The Hellhound Gang, they're--they're coming to free Ethan Crawley. Who told you that? Mayor Bowman told everyone. I don't know what else to do but hide as many of my flock as I can inside the church. You're welcome to join us if you'd like, Ivan. I can't. Doesn't look like we're gonna get much help, Jenny. Well, they're all afraid, Vernon. Men, they got our Colonel down there in their jail. We gonna let 'em keep our Colonel? - No! - Hell no, we ain't. We're gonna bring hell down on them shit heels. I want you to ride in there and shoot everything that moves. Yeah! After we thin out their numbers, we gonna march on that jail and free our Colonel. Yeah! Mount up. Let's go. What are you all so glum about? Afraid my Hellhounds gonna butcher everybody in town? Don't waste your breath. Says the blue-bellied General. Oh, that's right. I suddenly remember where I know you from. You are that scoundrel General John Basil Turchin. Do I say it right? I don't want to insult you, you know. General John here led a pack of scorchers. He used to set towns on fire. Any of you ever heard of the Rape of Athens? Did you tell 'em about your court martialing yet? I was fighting a war. You rode with Quantrill and his cowards who killed for pleasure. I remember the Lawrence Massacre committed by Quantrill's Raiders. That was a disgusting act. You really think so, huh? Well, I kind of liked it. Not gonna use your rifle? I work better at close range with these. I got something here that works just fine. All yours. Well, wow. I can raise Cain with this. So how should we do this? Well, you are the general. What's your plan? Agreed, let's hear it, Ivan. Okay. You two stay here. Don't let him out of your sight. And if the Hellhounds get inside, just kill him. Will do. Girls, you should get out of here. Stay with Nora. It's safe over there. I don't wanna leave you. You can't be here, Jenny. Please, do what Ivan says. Ladies, just go to the doctor's office, please. Come on, Jenny. Let's go. It's loaded. Wait, you don't want any firearms? No, I have my own. A word? Listen, I don't give a pig's ass what happened in the war. But I've seen you in action. You know what you're doing. But just between you and me, I get the feeling we got our hair in the butter bad with these Hellhounds. Probably. You ever been up against these kinda odds? Many times. What did you do? If you want to beat the enemy, you have to do everything better. If they're strong, you have to be stronger. If they fight hard, you have to fight even harder. What if they're monsters? Anyone can be a monster, you'd be surprised. No, I wouldn't. I used to be one a while back. I reckon today I'll have to be one again. No, you have to be the Sheriff. That's who you are. Keep your town safe. Keep your prisoner behind bars. That's your duty. Even if it means being ruthless. Well, in that case, why don't I just go back in there and cut down Crawley where he stands? I thought about doing the same thing. Well, why in the hell don't you? Two reasons. First, it won't stop the Hellhounds from coming here. And second, most importantly, Crawley deserves to be hanged. It'd sure be nice seeing him swinging from the end of a rope. It sure will, Sheriff. When did you get all this? Over the years. You know how to shoot? Ever since I was young, my parents made sure of it. How about you, Arlene? Aim, and pull the trigger? Right, but it needs to be loaded first. Here, I'll show you how, it's easy. Jenny? I've fired a gun before, Vernon showed me how. Good. Ivan? Why didn't you ever say anything about the war? I told you Nora, it's nobody's business. What are you hiding? Nothing. You're not a good liar. I'm not lying to you. Then tell me what happened in the war. Why? Because you need to tell someone. It's eating you alive. Did you ever hear about the Rape of Athens? I heard some things about it. My regiment took control of Athens, Alabama. But to be honest with you, the only thing I was doing, I was watching my brave men get picked off one by one, not just by Confederates, but by the town folks as well. That must have been awful. It was a nightmare, and I couldn't stop it from happening. What'd you do? I lost my temper. One day I said to my troops that I'm going to close my eyes. Won't see nothing for two hours. So I left the city and they ransacked all of Athens. A lot of that happened in the war. But I was a Colonel in charge of all 19th Regiment. Some military square heads, they didn't like what I did. So I was court martialed, Nora. And I said to the court, that you cannot fight slavers with soft gloves. It turned out President Lincoln heard about me and my trial. So he reinstated me and promoted me to Brigadier General. Well, then that's that. You were in the right. Some people don't think so. What do they know? I can't say I disagree. But it was war. It was war. That's what I keep telling myself, Nora. But it's the truth. You were just trying to protect your men during a time of madness. Just like you're trying to protect all of us now from Crawley's gang. I'm not so sure, Nora. Guess what? I am. No matter what happens outside, stay hidden. Don't let Crawley's gang find you. What if they do? Just make sure they don't. Are you saying we might have to use these on ourselves? No, use it on anyone who comes through this door. Ivan? Come back alive. You know what I'm thinking? There's gonna be one hard killing time coming up soon. Yes, and it's highly unlikely you will see the end of it. Unless of course, we all survive. In that case, we will escort you to the town of San Antonio to hang. Those are some future plans you got there, Crawley. So, you think you're ready for us, do you? Jenny, you take the window. Go. No! Lookie here. You think you're the first man to ever point a gun at me? You go over there. You go up the stairs. Stay here, I'm gonna check on the door. Jenny. Son of a bitch, I can't stand this. Watch Crawley. Good luck with that. There he is. Get down. You're a pretty one, aren't ya? We're gonna have fun. You bitch! Nora, Arlene, stay here. Protect Jenny. We will, Ivan. It hurts. Relax your breathing the best you can, Jenny, okay? - Okay? - You're gonna be okay. Here, press on her wound. Sorry. Okay, just hold still, okay? - I need to close the wound. - Okay. It's okay. She'll be okay. Promise, okay? Sheriff Kelly? Sheriff, it's me, Reverend Andrew. I'm in a bit of a-- bit of a bind, there's someone here who wants to talk to you about it. Sheriff Kelly? Don't you think you ought to talk to the preacher man, Sheriff? Talk to the preacher and see what he wants. Are you all right, preacher? You need to come out. Now, let's just have us a talk here. No shooting at each other for a minute. Just so you know, we found your town folk. Yeah, they're all down there hiding in the church. Now who the hell does that? Hide the town folk in a goddamn church? You oughta be ashamed of yourselves. What do you want? We want Colonel Crawley. Well, we ain't gonna give 'im to you. Well now, that's not good. 'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna torch that church and everybody in it. We're gonna shoot this preacher dead. I'm not gonna dicker with you shit heels. You do what I say right now, or you know what's gonna happen. Unless you already killed my Colonel, did you? Colonel Crawley, can you hear me? Are you all right? Never been better, Captain Grady. I don't know what to do. We can't release Crawley to them. We can't. I can't just let my whole town die. You can't trust them, I promise you they will kill the town anyway. What's it gonna be? I ain't gonna wait much longer. Goddamn good work, Captain Grady. Thank you, sir. Where is everyone? Dead, sir. Except for private Oakley and me and Corporal Waters down at the church. This town's got this big dumb German or Russian, whatever the hell he is, he just won't die. He killed every man I've thrown at him. He's a Russian, and he's crazy enough to eat the devil with his horns. And he's no other than General John Basil Turchin. The Rape of Athens general? That one. Now let me ask you a question. Do you think that son of a bitch, Turchin, is still alive? I don't know, sir. Threw every man we had at him, he killed 'em all. And now we have no men. Afraid not sir, other than what I told you about. But I ain't seen that Russian in a while, they might have got him. Somehow I don't think so. Send the preacher over here. You get that preacher and your town folks back when I'm riding out of this horseshit town. How about you both just toss your guns out here? Well, then we'll just be hanging on to the preacher for a while. Try to follow us, he's a dead man. You close that goddamn door and you stay inside, or I'm gonna burn down that chapel myself. You understand what I'm saying? Let's go, come on. Release the preacher. Preacher, thank you so much for your services. Now let's look at this beautiful chapel you built. Town folks waiting there for you. You know what I think? What? I think you should join them. You should join them in hell. What do you wanna do about that, sir? I say we torch the church. Town folks inside, have a look. This, this is what hell looks like. Bet you never thought you'd go out like this, did you asshole? You are wolf when it comes to killing. I gotta hand you that. Not a bullet left. So you gonna kill an unarmed man? Is that what you are, a Russian coward? I told you, we're both killers. You and me, we are the same. No, we're not. I greatly appreciate you volunteering to go along, General. I want to see justice served. So do I. I'd like to go with you Marshal, but I've got this town to look after, and I don't think the Mayor's coming back. At least I hope not. Hope to see you one day. Likewise. Watch yourself, General. I will. ♪ Hello, stranger ♪ ♪ Hello, friend ♪ ♪ We are here to greet the end ♪ ♪ Bad men livin', good men dyin' ♪ ♪ Heroes are late ♪ ♪ We shared our grief ♪ ♪ Dark horse driving while crow flies ♪ ♪ Bad men livin', good men dyin' ♪ ♪ Heroes are late ♪ ♪ We shared our grief ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪
