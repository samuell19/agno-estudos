Oh, shit. Shit, shit! Anybody home? Hi! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't think there was anyone here. I wanted some water for my car. May I? Yeah, sure. Thanks. I didn't mean to... I... Beautiful weather we're having. I'm on my way back to Paris. The scenic route is so much nicer. There was way too much traffic on the highway... I don't really know what's wrong with it. It's the first time this has happened. In fact, I had it checked in Marseille. Maybe it's the pump... Or a hose... but then again, it's not leaking anywhere... I just don't understand. I'll have to be careful... I don't want to break a cylinder! All right... well, thanks a lot. Say... you wouldn't mind dropping me off at the river, would you? It's not out of your way. Are you here on vacation? Yes, sort of... well, actually, I live here. Alone? No, we live as a community. - Right... as a community? - Yeah. There are quite a few of us. I see. So, it works well? Sexually, you mean? Ah, no, not particularly. I only say that because people are always asking me. But we're all cool about that stuff, you see. - Oh, really? - Yeah, sure. Oh, you can stop right here! All right, well... bye, and thank you! Goodbye. Hey! Instead of staring, how about swimming? - Is the water nice? - It's amazing! Take them all off, no one's around. No, but that's not the problem... - Aline! - Are you here to swim? No, I have to do my ablutions. - Hi! - Hi. Hot out, isn't it? Yeah, it's a scorcher. Weren't you in Goa in 1978? - Where? - Goa. Ah... No. That's funny, I feel like I've seen you somewhere before. No, perhaps just in another life. Perhaps, yes. Who's she? - Alexandra? - Yes. She's been here for two years. She's leaving soon for an ashram in Nepal. A what? An ashram. A Hindu monastery. Oh, yes, of course. She's special, isn't she? Say, what a great spot this is. I can't believe I have to leave. I have school on Monday. What is it you do? I work in sales for a firm that sells household appliances. Well, it's only Saturday. Stay with us tonight and then go back tomorrow. You know, driving back to Paris on a Sunday evening is a nightmare. Well, the others left for a protest earlier. Alex and I are all alone. You could keep us company. Yes, well... honestly, it's very tempting... Hello? Christine? It's me, Antoine... I'm in Lyon... yes, Lyon! Hello? Hello? Hello, Christine? Yes, can you hear me? Good... So, I was saying, I'm calling from Lyon. I won't be home tonight. I bumped into my buddy Cristobal! Can you hear me now? He invited me to stay with them tonight. No, I'll leave first thing tomorrow morning. I'll be there by the early afternoon. Ah, no, actually... You won't be able to reach me. No. Their telephone's out of order. I'm at the post office right now. Yes... hello? I can't hear you, I can't hear you! All right, yes... I love you too, see you tomorrow! How much do I owe you? Five francs. Why, yes, obviously, it's pleasurable... But it's much stronger than pleasure, it's spiritual. I only believe in orgasms. You're missing out on something truly fantastic. I'm sorry. Am I bothering you? No, no, not at all. It's very interesting. Anyway, it's getting late... I have another meditation to do. Goodnight! Bye! - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Here, let me help. - No, don't worry. It's so quiet! This really is the life. It makes you wonder what all us fools are doing in Paris. You don't have to, you know. Yeah... no, I know, but it takes a lot of courage to give it all up. Have you been here a long time? Three years. How'd you get out here? I hitchhiked. I'd just broken up with a guy and wanted to have some fun. What's that? Oh, it's the good stuff. We grow it right here. I take it you don't usually smoke? Yes, yes, of course. Does it make you feel good, sexually? A little. For me, it's wonderful. Hey, cool it! We have plenty of time. There's no rush. - Hi! - Hi! Did they hit you? Yeah, I took a bit of a beating. - Hey. - Hello. - This is Antoine. - I'm Gilles. Where are the others? They're staying down there. Did you eat already? Yes, but I'd love a drink. We got them good. Now they shouldn't build that damn plant! They want to build a nuclear power plant here? No, this is a nature reserve, it's protected. We'll be fine. We went to help friends. Does it hurt a lot? No, a girl covered it in some clay which seems to be working nicely. Thanks. Listen, in the short term, it's not nuclear power I'm most afraid of. The real danger round here is the fertilizers. They're poisoning everything with their damn chemicals. Well, I'm pretty tired. I think I'll go up to bed. They're exploiting the Earth to produce excessively. They don't care about the water table! As I always say, fighting against that should be our top priority. Don't you agree? Well, you know... I live in Paris, so up there, the main problem would be the exhaust fumes, you know... And the water! Have you tried the water in Paris? Ah, here come the little ones! They're as curious as cats. They have to come and see who's here. Yes, this is Antoine... go on... No, no, no, Antoine's tired. Antoine's been traveling all day. He wants to rest. We're going to ask you to leave, now. That's it... Marilyn, please... Epilon, no... out, now. There's nothing to see here. You'll notice they didn't leave anything nasty surprises behind. It took me a lot of effort to train them. Goats are very enriching creatures, but they're completely different to horses, see... - Yeah, of course. - Listen, out of 30 goats, at the end of the day, I only really know three of them, and then... I'm going upstairs. Coming, Antoine? Listen, the fresh air has knocked me out. I'm a little tired. OK. Give her one for me, buddy. - Night. - Night. You're a funny one, you know. I'd never have expected it from you, but you're actually a pretty good lay. - Oh, really? You think so? - Don't get all modest. You're not so bad yourself. Plus, you didn't mess around. Well, here, sexually speaking, we've overcome a certain number of taboos... When I want a man, I just tell him. I'm not complaining. I'd better get some sleep. I'm heading out early tomorrow. Wait... what are you doing? - Guess... - No... hey, stop... I'm exhausted. I'm finished. - I don't think so. - No... I have to be up... All right, I'd better get going. Will you come back? I'd really love to, but it'll be tough. It's summer vacation right now... I'll be pretty busy. I'm going to Corsica with friends. I'd love it if you came back. I'll try. Antoine? I dreamed about you last night. You were naked and playing the sitar. Oh, really? That's very kind... You're leaving? Wait... Drive safe, Antoine. Thank you. - All right, see you. - Bye... Good morning. Just fill her up and that's all. Thanks. Hi! Hi. How's it going? Fine. How are you? I'm so happy to be home. What are you reading? What are you doing? What do you think? I haven't seen you in over a week. Ah, so you're among the 22% of French men who still desire the woman they've been with for four years? Yes, perhaps. That's funny, I would have pegged you for one of the 37%. What 37%? The ones who only make love once a month. What are you saying? I'm saying that it's been 43 days since we did anything. Do you keep accounts or something? For the past year, yes. Do you want the stats? No, listen, please... You know since Durieux had his breakdown that my workload has doubled, so for the past year I've been exhausted. That's all there is. Anyway, I'm thirsty. - How's Cristobal? - He's on top form. Still a total idiot. Still balding... He looks like he combs his hair with a sponge. What are you doing here, Cristobal? Liliane's mother broke her femoral neck. We came as soon as we could. Right, that's such bad luck... I forgot to tell you, they arrived last night, just after you called. We'll leave you to it. Not at all, you should stay and have dinner with Antoine. I'll leave. - Where are you going? - My sister's. She's not on vacation? Yes, she left me the keys to her apartment. Don't make such a big deal out of it. When Cristobal slept with Monette, you thought it was hilarious. Absolutely not, I thought it was pathetic. Who the hell is Monette? No one, just an old flame... Yes, but not that old. Well, I'm going to see Mom. I can take care of her myself. Listen, Liliane... You guys have fun chatting about your whores! Want me to drop you off? It's on my way. All right, bye! Thanks a lot, buddy. What about your vacation in Corsica? It's not happening. Well, she's going alone. At least I don't have to deal with her parents. You could come to Cavalaire, we have room. Yes, thanks, that's very kind of you. Honestly, I think I'll just go back there and have a great time. I wouldn't think twice about it. Is she a looker, then, this girl? She's pretty easy on the eye, and she's not the only one, either! There's loads of chicks in this community. You dirty bastard. Can I come? Sure, anytime. Aren't there any guys? Well, I met one of them, and he's only interested in his goats. Listen, you're a lucky guy. That would never happen to me. I'll be bored out of my mind in Cavalaire with Odette and the kids! You made your choice, man! You signed the papers. I'll have a blast! I'm not going to wait until I retire. Yes? Good evening! You came back? Yes, hi! Is Aline here? No, actually... it's so silly. Aline left for Ardèche to go and visit some friends. Hello. Hi... but when's she coming back? I don't know. When's Aline coming back? In two days, I think. You can wait for her here. This is Antoine, a friend of Aline's. Yes, of course, stay! - The thing is... - Yes, come on! - Hey! Hi, Antoine. Back again? - Yes. How funny, Aline isn't here. - Yes, I... - I told him. I wouldn't want to impose... You're not imposing at all. - Have you eaten? - No. Sit down and have a bite to eat. Thanks. I'm Antoine Bonfils. My name's Blaise. This is Tania, my partner. Hello. - That's Jean-Pierre... - Hi. - Hi. - Marie-Jo, his wife... And Olivier... say hello, buddy. But I don't know this man. Olivier, be polite! But he's right, he doesn't know him, so why should he say hello? That's just a bourgeoise custom. I think it's a healthy reaction. I guess you're right... It's very difficult to unlearn one's educative prejudices. I used to be a teacher, so I'd know. Here, let me fix you a plate. We raised the chicken ourselves, without hormones. We cook it in water from the spring with wild herbs. It clears the intestines. And there are vegetables, too. Sorry, did you want some? Did you forget she's a vegetarian? I'm going to stretch my legs. Can you put him to bed? Hey, I'm Véronique. And this is the baby. Nice to meet you. See you later. All right, come on, buddy. Let's go. - So, where have you come from? - Paris. What's the weather like? - Nice enough. - Well, we're blessed down here. I couldn't agree more. Jean-Pierre! - What? - Are you trying to traumatize that child? - What's the matter? - You forgot his blanky! Here... I'll set you up in Aline's room. OK. Excuse me, I'm a little tired. It's been a long day. Goodnight. - Sleep well! - Goodnight. Thanks. It needs to be finer, or the dye won't take. I'd have preferred a deep blue. At this time of year, we only have madder. Red is a hard color to wear, especially for babies. "Tania, listen, the concert is over... Do you remember yesterday, your magnetic movements in the bluish volutes of dark narcotics? Hey, you, the man with the tambourine! Sing us your song. Our eyes are thirsty. Together we will drink from the sources of life. We are a rolling stone." What do you think? It's very good. I don't know anything, but I think the image of the rolling stone is very... powerful. Well, the title is "Tania", you know... Yeah. What's incredible is that, since that night, we've never been apart. Not a single infidelity. Our stone is still rolling. This is a very stimulating place for creation, you see. I'm always writing. Here. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Sure, thanks. Who published it? We did, right here. I had several offers from Parisian publishers, but I wasn't interested in being part of their system. I didn't want to end up at Pivot, I left that to the snobs. Yeah, you're right. Yes? I brought you some water. Thank you, that's so kind. - Goodnight. - How are you doing? Yes, I'm fine. Only eight days until Alan comes to pick me up. I'm so excited. Every night, I dream I'm a sacred cow. That's good, right? - Yes, I'm sure it is. - Goodnight. - Night. - Say, one last thing. If you'd told Aline you were coming, she'd have stayed. - You think so? - Yes, of course. Morning, Antoine. - Hi. - Did you sleep well? Yes, thanks. You weren't too bored by our stories last night? No, not at all. Marie-Jo felt that we didn't give you a warm enough welcome. Marie-Jo? The sweet, pretty lady with big, green eyes. Olivier's mother. My wife. Ah, yes... She's very sensitive to those kinds of vibrations. Sure, but not at all, you've all been very kind. What a relief! In any case, whatever it is you need, you can confide in her. She's something of a psychologist. I was just looking for you. Gilles needs a hand with the dyes. Awake already? Well, yes... - You sleep better in the countryside, huh? - Sure. Got a light? - Thanks, buddy. - Of course. Could you actually just close the... - Hi! - Hi. Where did they put the Mustela? Oh, I forgot to ask you! What year were you born? 1950. Why? Oh, so you're a pig! I'll look at the Chinese zodiac. I'll give you all the details later. I can read your birth chart. Do you know the time you were born? No. Oh! Oh, my goodness... It's a riot in there! Here, feel it! Oh, yeah! When is the baby due? Sometime this month. It's going to be a girl with blue eyes. Are you sure? Look, it's written, right here. Look, this is her father. What do you think? - Oh, yes. He looks nice. - He's an American ethnologist. I met him in Zimbabwe. Yeah. - Oh, is this yours? - Yes. Oh, what is it? Oh, that's lovely. I'm going to take this. Sure, if you want. All right, bye! Bye. Manosque-Créoux-les-Bains, this is Manosque-Créoux-les-Bains... Departing in one minute. Please stand back from the platform edge. Aline! Oh, hi! How are you? I'm fine... but what are you doing here? I went to the community and they said you were back. That's wonderful. I'm happy to see you. - Yes, me too. - These guys are real jokers. They asked to see my ticket. This is Francis, a friend of mine... - Hi. - Hi. Francis, this is... I'm such an idiot, I forgot your name! - Antoine. - Antoine! Antoine. Well, we can't stay here. - No, my car's right there. - Oh, great. Perfect, now we'll have plenty of space in the back. Say, if you wouldn't mind driving a little more slowly... she's delicate. Thanks. Hey, the wind is blowing the smoke into the house! It's unbearable. It's making me sick! - If that's all... - What's going on? The color isn't holding. - What happened? - Look... It would have been better in blue. It's like felt, look. As if it's burnt. How do you explain this? I followed the instructions. It said to boil for three hours! Here, look. It's illegible. Olivier, don't stand there! You should go inside! The fumes are bad for the baby. I just copied it out. The recipe's in Occitan. Blaise translated it. Good Lord, this is a disaster. I assume we haven't paid for the wool yet? Did we definitely use madder root? Oh, come on, of course we did! It's not your fault. You couldn't have known. Still, a blue would've been nicer, right? Enough with the blue! That's not the problem! What will we live on this winter? Listen, we've gone through worse. We'll manage. Dyeing during a full moon is never a good idea. And that smell is just atrocious. Awful! What are we going to do? Listen, if there's anything I can do, if you need to borrow some money. Thanks, that's kind of you. But here we get by by ourselves. Parisian, tête de chien, Parisian... - Olivier, stop that! - Tête de chien... Are you insane? What did I say? - Mom! - He's bleeding! No, no, no! Stay right there. I'm not used to this. You got this. There you go. Just like that. Squeeze all the way down. I'm afraid of hurting her. No, no, you won't hurt her. Oh, yes, now it's coming! Funny. So, how did you end up here? It was after 1968. I was living in Paris before. I was disgusted by our consumer society. So, I decided to live life differently. I started by turning off the heat, taking showers as infrequently as possible or in cold water, and knitting my own sweaters with sustainably sourced wool. I reduced all my needs. I went barefoot. Every time I wanted to buy something, I'd stop and think: "Do I really need this?" And each time, the answer was no. So, how did you live? Like a bum. I got sick, you see. I lost my job and my home. So, I ended up coming down south. I thought poverty would be less painful in the sunshine. - So, how do you like the job? - Getting there. Better than in Paris, right? Oh, yes. That's for sure. Can you take over? I need to go to the dairy. Is it normal for it to foam? Yes, don't worry. Say, I've been thinking about your offer. It's real nice of you, given that you barely know us. I think we will accept your money. Listen, it would be my pleasure to help out. Why wouldn't I? I know a lot of people who wouldn't have offered. How much do you need to get by? 8,000. Oh, shit. Can I write you a check? - Oh, you're here. - Yeah. I see you've settled in. And you've put my things over here. How's the atmosphere here? Yeah, it's good. What kind of trip are you on? Environmental? Sexual? Mystical? What? Are you here to pray or fuck? Oh! No, I'm just here. What about the chicks? Good, good. Awesome. Antoine! - Excuse me. - Sure, go ahead. Oh, I'm absolutely delighted! You know, you're part of the family now? Everyone loves you, right, Blaise? Yes, absolutely. Antoine fitted right in. It's wonderful. Do you know what this means? No. Tell him. No, you tell him. He'll be happier hearing it from you. Well, it means you get your own space. My own space? Yes, like everyone else. You'll have your own area, just for you, which you can set up and decorate however you like. I'm so jealous! This takes me back a few years, you know? Back to when Tania and I first got our own space. Come and see! Hey! Did you hear? Antoine's getting his own space! Awesome! - Really? - Yeah! Wait... Here it is! What does this mean? - What? Don't you like it? - No, I mean, that other guy... Francis? Well, is he your boyfriend or what? My boyfriend? No, don't be silly. No, like I told, I'm not like that. Yes, but he's moved into your bedroom! I know what's going on. So what? Just because he sleeps in my bed doesn't mean he can tell me what to do. I don't want a guy like that. Will he be staying long? I don't know. He comes and goes. He's a free spirit. Because I'll be... out here. That won't stop us from making love whenever we want to. You know, sexually, you really aren't that cool. I can be cool. Come on, then. - What? Here, now? - You don't know what you want. Oh, I think I know what I want. I like the song you're playing. - Did you write it? - Yes. It's good to have a musician among us. I know someone who'll be delighted. Yes, Marie-Jo. You know, the tall, sweet blonde with big, green eyes? - Oh, right. - She's my wife. She loves music. If you ever want to talk about music with her, go for it. She knows her stuff. She plays piano. - Oh, yeah? - Yes. I don't understand. This is the first time that's ever happened to me. Don't worry. It happens to everyone. It's that guy being here that bothers me. I feel like he's right there. It's messing with my head. Listen, when you loosen up, let me know, OK? Aline! Say, I wanted to ask you how it works in a community when you sleep with more than one person. Well, that depends... I know a commune in Ardèche where they have fuck tickets. The chick gives out as many as she wants to each guy and you can redeem them when you want. Really? Another solution is group sex. Take Marie-Jo, for example. That's how she gets her kicks. You're kidding! Jean-Pierre and Marie-Jo lived with this Arab guy, Abdul, in a ménage à trois. But then they had a fight. Well, naturally. Having three of you in bed must cause some problems. No, it wasn't about that. It was to do with a camera or something. - Hi, Antoine! - Hi! I won't ask what you're up to. Are you from North Africa? Me? No, why? I don't know, just seeing you in a djellaba reminds me of an Algerian friend. There was a guy who lived here, his name was Abdul. Listen to that, buddy! Tweet, tweet! It's a lark, guarding its nest! In the field. Let's go and see. He was a really nice Arab, you know. Not racist at all. And extremely manly. You remind me a lot of him. Right. Well, excuse me, I'm kind of in a hurry. Hey, give that back! It's mine! Honestly, Olivier! Stop that! I can't use this now. - I labored. - I sowed. - I cut the grain. - I kneaded the bread. And yet we still have nothing to eat. Bread! Bread! That's the only word on your lips. The earth belongs to those who own it. No, no, no, to those who work it! Now you play a chord. Whether you are a winemaker or a laborer, you can hold your head high and feel victorious. The farmers of France will no longer be repressed. One, two... Well? What did you think? Great. It was really great. And the ending, that was really strong. It makes you think. You'll see the impact on the farmers. You'll be amazed. This is the first time someone is addressing their problems, their concerns. Yes, of course. What did you think about the music? Listen, I'm a little more conflicted... Really? Maybe it's a little harsh, but It turns it into a bit of a variety show. - Oh? - It's not that he plays badly, it's just a matter of taste. And will he be here for the performance? Yes, of course. Why? I don't know, I thought he was just passing through. Oh, now you've got me worried. Hey, Francis! Are you here for July 14? Yes, yes, he'll be here. What a relief! Yes, that would've been awful. Ah! Ah! I'm so sorry. What's going on? Oh, it's you, Antoine. And I got you all wet! No, no, it's fine. What are you doing down there? I'm sleeping here because my space isn't ready yet. Would you mind chatting with me a while? No, of course not. Because I can't sleep. I'm a little anxious. I'm scared to leave. Well, that's to be expected. And then just now, in the dark, I was thinking about a painting I saw at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. You know, it was a painting with two very distinct parts... One side was all torn up, all cold tones and sharp angles, and the other was all warm shades and precise strokes. It reminded me of Buddha's two teachings: suffering and then deliverance from suffering. Yes, that is funny, isn't it? Are you interested in religion? No, not particularly. I'm not against it, but... You must think that I'm some kind of weirdo. No, not at all. It's because you see me meditating all the time, but you know, meditation is a joyful and very enriching experience. Yeah. And how did you discover it? Through Indian music. You know, I've always been pretty detached from the outside world. Yeah? All I'm really interested in is learning about what's inside of me. Isn't that difficult, surrounded by people living normal lives? No, no. Not for me. I don't despise the world, but I can isolate myself from it very easily. Yes, it all depends on will, right? Sure. Anyway, if you'll excuse me. Yes, I'd better go, too. Thanks for listening, Antoine. I think it's really important to know how to listen to others. Yes. Goodnight. Don't be sad, Tania! Nepal is just so far away! And locking yourself away in a monastery, at your age... But she's going to have a great time! We should all be happy for her. - Bye! - Goodbye. Goodbye, Alex. Say, which one's Alan? The guy in white, with the beard. - Isn't he handsome? - Yes. All right, goodbye! Give Aline and Francis a kiss from me. I didn't want to wake them, they'd just gone to sleep. - Sure, OK. - Goodbye, sweetie. Travel safe. - Goodbye! - Bye. ASNIÈRES TO KATHMANDU - Bye! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! - Bye! - Have a good journey! Bye! - Travel safe! VALSAINTES COMMUNITY HONEY I don't know how many sweaters Véronique wants us to sell. In any case, it's so hot... What do I say for the cheese? Three francs for a small, five for a large. If they ask me how it's made? It's goat's cheese made with whole milk. Wrap it up and take the money. - OK. - I'll be right back. How can I help? I’d like some cheese. Do you make it yourself? Ah... the cheese? Yes. - You want some cheese? - Yes. OK... She wants to know if you make it yourself. Yes, right, OK... a small? A piccolo... A petit, OK, small... that's three francs. and the big ones... Fünf francs. Well, let’s take one. Please don't touch the cheese. Thanks. She wants to know if you make it yourself! Hey, Antoine! - What are you doing here? - Hi, Walter! How's it going? This is Luigi. A photographer. - Hi. - Ciao. So, you're a cheesemonger now? No... Ein minute, bitte... I'm a little busy. The price is here. No, I'm just helping some friends out. Oh, yes! Your community, with the chicks. Is it a free-for-all? Orgies every day? I'm having a good time. It's terrible. They didn't want to take her with them. Oh, shit... Be right there. Check out the candy. They're models. He's doing a shoot with them in the area. - Oh, really? - Well, I'll leave you to it. See you at work. OK. Bye, Walter. But what did this Alan guy say to you? He said I wasn't ready for the journey. Poor thing. He preferred the girl with the Jaguar. Oh, no, not in the cheeses! Tania! Marie-Jo! Take her somewhere else! I don't know, it's closed. It's midday. Finished. No more cheese. No more cheese! I need to get all this back in... it's ruined! What's going on? Here, hold this for me. ADULTERY What's this bullshit? Is it yours? I also bought Le Monde, babe. I knew she wouldn't be leaving. Two days ago, I drew the cards twice, but I didn't tell her. Both times, the three of clubs was turned down. Classic. I don't believe in cartomancy at all, but that is concerning. Either way, in every departure is a return. Yeah, that's for sure. What does that mean? In every return there's a departure, too. Ah, right. I'll see if she's calmed down. I'm so worried about her. OK. Alexandra? Alexandra... Listen, just speak to her normally. Alexandra! Alexandra! Enough! We should do something, not scream into the void. Maybe she did something stupid. - Alexandra! - Don't just stand there! - Honey, you know... - Get a move on! - Alexandra! - What? I don't know... get up there and break down the door, quick! We'll break down the door. Put Olivier to bed. This isn't for a child! Come on, buddy. This isn't a game. Off we go. Alexandra! Alexandra! Alexandra! No, Blaise, be careful! - It's solid oak! - Oh, darling... Your bad shoulder! Get out of the way, I know what I'm doing! Are you all right, Alexandra? Why... yes, I'm fine. That's my rum! That's my rum she's drinking! She's drinking my rum! Honestly, let her drink it. Just leave me be. When I drink, I don't want to see anyone. I'm ashamed. Antoine? - Antoine! - Antoine... - Yes? - I'd like to speak to you. What should I do? Go on! You can sit down. All right. You're disappointed in me, right? No, not at all. It's normal. You had a big shock, then you drank a little too much. It happens to everyone. You're so kind, but I know you're disappointed in me. And I'm going to disappoint you even further. Why do you say that? Well, after everything I said yesterday. What's the matter? I hope you won't take it badly. Take what? That I want to make love to you. - You do? - You don't want to? No, no, I never said that. It would really help me. Well, honestly, if it would help you, then... Where are you going? I'm just going to cover the hole in the door. To avoid any drafts. - Hi. - Hi! Don't get too close, they're really irritated this morning. I don't know what's wrong. How are you doing? Fine. You? Very good. You know, I've really loosened up. Yes, everyone's well aware of that. You made enough noise last night. Say, when you're finished here, how about I give you a tour of my space? You men are all the same. I can't just do it on demand. I'm not a machine. No, no, I know, but be careful. Your friend is pretty good in bed. I don't know if I can resist. Good, she doesn't have a guru anymore. I think a shaved head would really suit you, actually. Very funny, bravo. Look out! A bee! Stop that! Don't touch me! What's the matter? Look, I wasn't myself yesterday. I really regret what happened. What? Anyway, Alan was right not to take me, because it's true. I wasn't ready. Surely you're not going back to that scammer again... Clearly you don't know anything about him. Listen, you're so naïve... He decided to take a girl with loads of cash instead. Yes, Susannah has a lot of money. So what? She donated it to the ashram. Doesn't that make her worthy of going? I'm so ashamed of what happened yesterday! I need to get it together. I need to be able to definitively repress each and every desire. You didn't say that last night. Don't ever mention it again! It's disgusting! "Fissa"? "Fissa" isn't even a word. Yes, it is. It's Arabic. We're not playing in Arabic. Take your letters back. Play another word. One, two, three, four... It's coming. Try to relax. I don't like storms. Have you heard the tale of the Lord of Pouroux? He was a very important man in the region and a great hunter. One day, he forced a deer all the way into a church and finished it off from behind the high altar. Legend has it that, to punish him, God condemned him to wander eternally on stormy nights... There he is! Look! Right there! Oh! But that's Pred! What are you doing here? I'm sorry. It was locked downstairs. I called, but no one answered. Luckily I found this ladder. Hey, a ridge tile got washed away! It was pissing it down up there. Why, hi, Pred! What are you doing here? I just got back from Zagreb. I couldn't stand that country of freaks any longer. I hitchhiked back and caught the flu somewhere in the Alps. Oh, shit. Yes, it must have been very cold. Could you take me in for a couple of days before I leave for Morocco? Why, of course. Oh, my goodness! - I think I'm having a contraction. - Wait! Yes, this time it's happening! She's gone into labor! Right, I'll get the car ready for the hospital. What, so they can kill her? Surely you don't want her to give birth here? How did they do it before? But that's crazy! Don't worry. - I'll take care of it. Aline! - Are you a doctor? No, but I have a sister who's a midwife. Boil some water. All right. Gilles, can you help me carry her? This will be the community's first birth! What you're doing here is criminal and illegal. Personally, I wash my hands of it. Wait, Aline, I'll help you! When Olivier was born, I was holding Marie-Jo's hand and she dug her nails in until I bled! It was very, very tough. I feel inspired to write. I'm going upstairs. I want to wake Olivier so he can see this! Oh, no, no! Definitely not! Say, buddy, you don't know where I could find some cough drops, do you? This isn't the time! A lemon and some scissors, quick! To do what? The lemon for the kid's eyes and the scissors for the cord! Call yourself a teacher. A lemon... Do you think there are any lemons left? Because I'd love one with some hot water for my throat. Véronique, do you realize that you're incredibly lucky to give birth to a tiny being in your own home, surrounded by loved ones, just like the old days, just like in our grandparents' time. He's beautiful! - You were wonderful! - When industrial civilization had not yet turned our lives upside down... When official medicine had not yet ravaged our world... Shit, the baby's black! It's crazy how many rocks this thing needs, huh? But why do you want to rebuild the walls? What's the point? Blaise says that if our elders took the trouble to build them, it was for a reason. Believe me, we'll find out what it is. And why can't this idiot give us a hand? He has his own problems. Him? That surprises me. I heard them this morning. Ever since Véronique gave birth, Aline's been insisting she wants a baby. No kidding. Daddy over here doesn't really seem to be into it. Say, fellas... I've been watching you for a while, and you shouldn't be messing around with other people's hard work! It took us two years to knock down those damn walls. You'll have to move it all, otherwise, during the harvest, we can't get the machines past. All right, children. Paul is here today to talk about an important issue, but he'll explain it better than I can. Go ahead, buddy. Guys, I won't downplay how serious this is. Our community in Larrague is being threatened with expulsion. The old lady who rented us the barracks has died. Her son wants to sell up. Asshole! Did you have a lease? No, it was verbal. Ah, well... No, that's not the issue. That's just an excuse. He's tried to get rid of the communities in the region lately. Well, they must have warned you. Don't take that for granted. In 1934... In 1934, it was the skeptics that let Nazism in. And I can tell you this, because I'm very familiar with the issue. Almost the exact same thing happened in Peru when it came to dividing land. Be careful, because it's always the same process. At first, people don't believe it, maybe even laugh about it. Then one day you find yourself in a stadium with a number on you. So, in practical terms, we're one of several communities in the region who want to organize a protest, and we wanted to know if you'd join us. Well, yeah. We have to go. Enough of the guitar already, Francis. But what's the use? Anyway, I didn't refuse to join the army to wave banners around. Why doesn't that surprise me! Well, I don't want to influence anyone. People can make their own decisions. I'll go. Me, too. I feel like it's my duty. Look, I'm not really a part of this community, but if you'll have me... That's so sweet of you, Antoine. It's how I feel. I'm glad that we see the same way. Thank you, comrades. Thank you. They're a motivated bunch, your lot! Is there time for a drink? Say, tell me, how are we meant to dress for this thing? Normally. Landlords, bastards! Listen, how about we spend a weekend on the coast? My friends have a house in Cavalaire. Sure, I've never been! And you're a swimmer! DEVELOPERS = DESTROYERS NO TO EVICTIONS No to evictions! - No to evictions! - What's the guy's name? - Triconet. - Triconet to the balcony! Triconet to the balcony! Ask for an interview. Triconet, we need to talk! Triconet! - I'm going in. - Not alone. Take a witness. Triconet! Hey, you, Paris boy. Come with me. We're just going to have a chat. Triconet! Triconet! If you're not back in 10 minutes, we'll break down the door! I'll hold them back! Olivier! Give me that. This kid is a pain. Control yourself, man! No rioters here. If you want trouble, - go somewhere else. - But... My poor mother... It was so sudden. I got an offer from a developer in Marseille... He even came to view the property. But there's no way I'm selling it. As for you all, Mother didn't want anything to change. She told me so the day before she died. She said... What the hell are you doing? Hurry up! Triconet! Triconet! Triconet, tiny dick! I'm sorry. I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding. It doesn't matter. All right, we'll leave you alone. Please, it's no trouble at all. No, I'll show you out. Thank you for coming by. There they are! They're back! Well? What happened? Well, we won! We won! We won! We won! Nice job, Antoine. We won! We won! The cops are coming! Scram! Split up! Spread out! Mrs. Tramoni? Is my leg ready? Yes, officer. Thanks. How much do I owe you? Who's the bastard that called them? Scram! Oh, shit! My back! NUCLEAR? NO THANKS! - Is that all right? - Yes. - Have you got him? - Yes, hurry up, now. Mama Ravanel? Say, Blaise! What brings you here? - How are you? - Fine. One of our guys took a hit. Bring him in, quick. Jésus will take care of him. What about me? I know, but this is an emergency. You'll be right as rain after this, you'll see. THE CHRIST OF LOUBIGNE THANK YOU FOR HEALING ME All right, sir, just take off your shirt and try to relax. Here, Blaise, have a glass. Thank you. Cheers! To your good health. Say, I wanted to ask you... Jésus is working overtime at the moment. We're rolling in it. Will I risk losing my pension? In these situations, let them make the first move. Right. It's for the best. No checks, right? - No. - Then you're fine. Later on, you should try to set up a small company. No, Jésus, that's your fifth Coke! - I'm thirsty! - Then drink some water! The kid knows what he's doing, huh? He's got the magic touch. That's why they come from all over just to see him. Here, Jésus, take your ball and play outside for five minutes. And leave the chickens alone! How much do I owe you? Well, I'll give you mates rates. That's so kind of you. You see, it's only 300 francs. These little bitches! Jésus! I told you to leave the chickens alone! So, how do you feel? I don't really know. The ointment takes time. Yeah, but it stinks! Yeah, it's made from dung! How are you? Feeling better? Fixed? He needs to lie down. Of course. OK. Listen, I wanted to ask you... I think our weekend plans are ruined. Too bad, we'll go another time. - Really? - Yes. Here he is, the hero. Oh, no. Come on. Say, could we borrow your car? Aline wants to go see a movie in Avignon. - Right now? - You don't mind, do you? - No. - You're the best. Hey, be careful with the gearshift. It can be tricky. Sure thing. Shit! DOCTOR MORIN PHYSICIAN Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye. No need to thank me, it was a real pleasure. It's been a long time since I last felt someone's vertebrae. Next time, come straight to me. - It'll save you a lot of time. - Sure. To think, I spent seven years studying medicine in Marseille, but whenever anyone's sick they go and see the healer. They still call me for STDs and snake bites... Usually too late, obviously. How short the grass is this night! Dry! Everything is dry! Like your ass! It's as though the earth has never been kissed by a single drop of rain! Have courage, all of you! If the cows have no grass, my child will have no milk. Just give it wine! Continue! The audience is reacting! That's a good sign. Look! Up high! The clouds! Yes, they're swelling, inflating! I told you so, my friends. Rain! Rain! Splish, splash, splosh! We are the drops, drops of water, drops, drops, drops of water. Now, listen up. I know that we're all here to have a good time, but respect those who wish to listen. Thank you. Don't even bother trying to reason with those guys! Just liquor them up. No, that exactly what they want! Don't let them win. Now it's calmed down, let the show recommence! Curtain! Curtain! Quick, start playing! Where've you been? Just out for a walk. This is a really lovely little town. How's your back? Feeling better? Perfectly fine. I told you, didn't I? He's an odd guy, but that Jésus is a miracle-worker. Yeah. - Want a pastis? - Sure. Two more. Isn't the troubadour around? I know he pisses you off, but don't worry. He'll be gone soon. The fire's been lit. They had another fight this morning. Aline left in tears, and that's why he came out with us. There he is. How's it going? What'll you have, sir? - A pastis. - You got it. No, we need to get going after this. Just wait for me. Yeah, a pastis. Peace and quiet for once. I'm not complaining, but it's hard up there. Yeah, I mean... We're always on top of one another. At least you have your own room! Check her out. Not bad, right? Yeah, she's cute. I'd go there for sure. How old do you think she is? 15, 16? Ready for her first love? Wait, stay there. I'll go. The Parisian's finally loosening up! Francis, Gilles, this is... Charlotte. Hi! Véronique! Don't you get bored out here? We don't have the time. We do a lot of activities: cheesemaking, weaving, beekeeping, organic farming... So, you're environmentalists? Yes. Well, we try to live in harmony with nature and among ourselves. I'm a writer, for example. What do you write? I write... well, if you're interested, I could show you some of my work. Oh, you know, for me, reading... What are you doing here? On vacation? Yeah, staying with an aunt. But I'm so bored out here. It's kind of a bummer. - Can I have some water? - Go ahead. At least eat a little rice. No, I'm still fasting. You know I don't like that! Your friend looks terrible. It's her religion, that's all. Well, she's not missing out on much, because this rice... What about the rice? It's pretty disgusting. It's overcooked. Brown rice is always like that. That's what makes it so nutritious. It's like having a sponge in my stomach. Do you often eat like this? Every day. Don't get me started, it's hell. Well, if you're not happy, then you can cook your own food. Yeah, I have to say, Francis, you've got some nerve. I was only saying. No, but if you don't want it, don't eat it. Well, I don't want to get fat. Why do you say that? Well, it's just a statement. Everyone knows that rice is fattening. I thought it was aimed at someone. No, no. Leave her alone! Stop making a big deal! I'm not making a big deal out of it! Come on, let's go for a swim. Yeah, good idea. It's way too hot. She's got a nice figure. What's the matter with you? What's wrong with Francis today? He's being so aggressive. I'm very disappointed and hurt by this incident. I thought we were past the stage of being petty. Clearly, that isn't the case. Jean-Pierre, please don't argue. This is the kind of thing that makes me want to write. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, honey, come on, now. Cheer up. Those kids are idiots. Your play wasn't bad at all. Thank you so much. Not bad at all. And I'd know, I'm in the industry. - Oh, really? - I'm a TV stagehand. The things I've seen... Will you dance with me? Yeah, of course. What about St. Teresa of Avila? Do you think she ever came? It's impossible to confirm. There are so few texts. Are you all right? Yes. Why? I don't know, it seems like your mind is somewhere else. Where else would it be? Thinking about Francis? My poor Antoine, you still don't understand anything! We don't have relationships like that. Enough with the firecrackers, buddy! You're annoying your mom and Mr. Raimondo. - It wasn't me! - Shut up. You've never had warm goat's milk, fresh from the teat? You know, in Paris... Ah, you're here on vacation? Yeah, at the campsite. You'll have to swing by our community. Anyway, he hasn't slept with that girl. Even if he had, he's free. You really are so bourgeois. You don't like it? Thank you, everybody! And a big thank you to the band. And now, as is our annual tradition, get ready to feast your eyes... It's time for the fireworks! - Will you walk me home? - Sure. Coming home alone, buddy? - Yeah. - I'll let you get in on this, if you like. What are you doing out here? No, I'm good, thanks! You're really going to pass? Whatever! Hi. Did I wake you? Are you all right? What's going on? Are you leaving? Yeah. Hey, Aline... Wake up! - Francis is leaving. - What? Francis is leaving! I'm off to Ibiza. I was going to leave you a note. It'll be gorgeous down there. No, shut up. What is going on? I've got a ride, so I'm leaving. That's me. I'm off. See you! - Bye. Have a great time. - You can't just leave like this! Give me a kiss, then. Bye, babe. I've got to get going. Bye! It's not necessarily the cool guys who are the most comfortable. Will you shut up? Bye! Have a good trip! - Are you happy now? - No, why would I be? Listen... I understand, I really do. It's a terrible thing to do, but... He's not a total asshole. Maybe he'll be back. He was really fond of you, he told me himself! And besides, I'm here... Come on, give me a smile. - Leave me alone! - Don't cry... The bastard left her. Leave her to me. I'll talk to her. You really don't have to... It's fine, go take a break. She'll be better in two hours. There, there, Aline... Oh, no, no, no. I want to die! No... I'm really worried about Aline. I'm scared she'll get depressed. I was wondering if I should take her away for a while... Are you coming? One second, I'm explaining something to Olivier! A friend of mine has a house on the coast, near Cavalaire. Maybe I could drive her down there. That teacher can fuck off. A scythe is composed of three parts: the handle, the grip and the blade. Are you coming or what? Take the handle in one hand and the grip in the other, like this. Then, in a wide, circular motion... Careful, stand back. This is very dangerous. Now, watch... I'm going to tell Mom! Oh, shit. Hey, that's Aline! Yes, I guess it is. Aline! Aline! Did she even say where she was going? Home to her husband, probably. She's married? Didn't you know? To a police officer from Aubagne. A police officer? Great. It keeps getting better. It's the classic story, you know. She got married too young to escape her family, to a simple guy who never fulfilled her sexually. She's always dreamed of another life, and that's how she ended up here. I think she idolized mine and Blaise's relationship. It gave her some hope, courage for the future. She made a fool out of me! No, you're wrong about that. Deep down, she's very vulnerable. She spent three years in therapy. I think you would be really good for her. It's a shame you never tried to understand her. Are you kidding me? No, Antoine, it's not your fault, but morally, you're still involved in the situation. Oh, that makes me feel better! When I say morally... No, I get it. I'm responsible for everything. Listen, I don't want to bother you, I'm out of here! That's not what I... Antoine! Antoine! Of course you rats are eavesdropping! To think, I put up with your bullshit all summer... Everyone's so kind, peace and love, we're so happy, we're better than everyone else, we're free! Bullshit! I hate this place. I've wasted a month with you fake, shit-stirring idiots! That's a little harsh. Well, yes, we very kindly took you in. Yes, and it cost me 8,000 francs! Thanks a lot! What do you mean, 8,000 francs? Nothing, it's between Blaise and Antoine. I'm out of the loop, I guess. Obviously you're out of the loop. Not surprising, you do nothing. Nothing? Me? You're a pain. Enough, you two! Don't stoop to his level! - He says I do nothing! - It's OK. Listen, this is silly! We need to convince Antoine to stay! Just think about this a moment. Don't leave so hastily! This is the cherry on top. Blaise? Hey, guys, come and see this! It'll be worth it. Honestly... The poet. Listen, Tania... I swear... No, please... Excuse me, sorry. Thanks. He's the one who pushed that poor girl into Blaise's bed! I'm sure it was him! Asshole! You shut your mouth. No, seriously. Everyone knows Blaise fucks all the girls who come past. What? Is that what you think? Thanks a lot, buddy. I'm really disappointed in you, you know. How could you say such a thing? Then why was he kicked out of Angers Youth Center? For political reasons! Enough of the "ideal couple" act. It's so boring! He doesn't even fuck you anymore! Without your uncle's inheritance, he'd be gone! He's with you for money. My money? You're all living off of my money! Sweetheart! Stop! Stop this, or I'm leaving! Will you shut up for once, instead of pretending to leave for the Zulus and coming back and just whining! Yeah, well, at least I don't need two men in my bed to get off! Don't even go there! Then why's Raimondo here? Leave him out! He's not even French! You're the one who fakes orgasms! Stop it! You're crazy! - Here, this is for your father! - Don't touch my son! He hit Olivier! You asshole! Let me go! He's a pain in the ass! You take that back! What? Too unhappy to finish? Don't touch me, you scumbag. Go fuck your goats! Go on, Dad! Sock it to him! Well done, are you happy now? You've woken the baby! Treehuggers, motherfuckers. Parisian, tête de chien... It's a totally different way of life down there. You learn the true value of simple things. It's the good life. There's no aggression, no conflict. Everything's easy, everything's cool. It was a pretty exceptional trip. Very enriching. If Christine and I have kids, I want them to do the same. I'd be so afraid of them doing drugs. This summer in Cavalaire, we saw so many kids in a terrible state. Horrifying. Drugs! Down there it's the fresh air, the spring water... At the end of the day, it's all about the food. Once you've grown your own carrots, it's never the same. So, are things better between you two? The separation was really good for us. Plus, she's really gotten into organic cuisine, you'll see. It's for you. Right, OK. Hi, Antoine. Hi. Did you hear about the big march against vivisection? We didn't know where to stay, then we thought of you. Just for two or three days. No more than that. Yes, well... you came to the right place. Subtitle translation by: Rebecca Schofield
