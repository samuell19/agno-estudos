Your bath's ready. You know l can't take a bath today with this foot. And besides, it isn't Saturday. That's the worst case of gout l ever saw. - What causes that? - Too much high living. - Too much what? - Too much high living. Maybe we better move down to the basement. lf it... Shut up. What would you advise, Doctor? Cut out all rich foods, lead the simple life. Go out into the country, get away from all this wild life. Remember, you can't burn the candle at both ends. We don't burn candles, we've got electric light. You see... Will you please shut up? Where can l go, Doctor? Take a trip to the mountains, a high altitude. Say! Why don't you get yourself a tent? Go out and rough it, drink plenty of water. And lots of it. Relax...and try and forget everything. lf you hadn't gone to that beer parlour... And that goes for you, too. Now, do as l tell you. Take your trip and when you come back you won't know yourself! Goodbye. - You know what'd be a swell thing to do? - What? What? Why don't we get a trailer to hook on the back of your car? Much better than a tent. Can you take them into the mountains? Sure! Right up in the high multitude. What do you think? We can't afford one of those trailers. We could rent one. l know a fella that's got one for rent and we could get it for next to nothing. lf we paid cash, we'd get it less than that. What do you think about that? - We'll go right down and see him. - Swell. Help me down to the car. lsn't there any other way? My back's broken carrying you up and down these stairs. That would be like you! To desert a friend in his hour of need. Come on. l never saw anybody complain as much in my life. Take it easy. (Ollie yelling) (Whimpers) Come on, quick! We'll dump the liquor in the well. Let's see 'em! Stick 'em up! - Come on. - Come on! - lsn't is lovely up here? - lt certainly is. You know, my foot feels better already. Where's your bad foot? There's a beautiful place over there. Why don't we park down that side? All right. lsn't that gorgeous? - lsn't this ideal? - lt sure is. Just what the doctor ordered. One month up here and we wouldn't know each other. We got a well and water and lots of it and everything. Go in and ask the folks if they'd mind if we park here. - ls there anyone in there? - Not now but there was a minute ago. - Who was it? - lt was me. l was knocking on the door when... Never mind the details. Let's get some food, l'm famished. l was knocking on the door! Hmm! Ahh! Ohh! (Humming happily) What'll we have for dinner? How about a plate of beans and a pot of steaming hot coffee? Swell. You sure know how to plan a meal. (Chuckles) You fix the coffee and l'll do the rest. (Humming happily) There's no water. Draw some from the well. That's what wells are for. (Continues humming) - Say, Ollie. - What? Has this water gone a funny colour? Look. lt doesn't look the same as ours does. Well, there's nothing wrong with this. lt's the iron in it, that's the way all mountain water tastes. That's why the doctor said to drink plenty of it. Try some, it's good for your nerves. - lsn't that funny? - What? - lt tickles. - (Chuckles) Ah! - l feel better already. - Oh, it's delicious. - Where's the can opener? - Eh? The can opener. (Humming) (Continues humming) ## La-de-de de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de Pom-pom. ## La-da-da-da de-da-da-de-de-da-di ## La-da-di-de-de da-dum-de-da-dum Pom-pom. ## La-da-di-de-de da-dum-de-da-dum Pom-pom. ## De-de-da-de-de da-dum-da-de-de Pom-pom. ## La-da-di-de-de-da dum-de-da-dum ## Pom, po-pom, pom, pom, pom ## La-da-di-da-da-de da-di-di-dium Pom-pom. ## La-da-di-di dum-dum-de-de-de ## Pom, pom, pom, pom ## (Clang!) l'm singing this song. Put the coffee on. Don't chop the wood up there. Put it on the floor! Argh! Ooh! - Where's my other shoe? - l don't know. - Didn't you bring it? - l haven't got it. l can't go around with my foot like this! l'll catch my death of cold. Maybe we can find something for you to wear. Why don't you put this on till after dinner? Then we can fix your shoe with some glue. All right. l told you when we passed the last station to get some gas. But you never pay any attention to me. - Aw, shut up. - l won't shut up! Oh, look! There's some people over there with a trailer. Maybe we can get some gas from them. - Maybe. - Oh! (Knock on door) Come in. (Hiccups) Sorry to trouble you. My name's Mr Hall, this is this missus. What can l do for you? We're out of gas. Do you have any spare? Why certainly! There's a spare can on the floor, just help yourself. Thanks a lot. Could l have a drink of water? l'm so thirsty. Why certainly. Thanks. Say, this is delicious. lt's the iron in it. - You want some? - No. OK, baby, you don't know what you're missing. Hey, come on. Oh, you get the car and bring it here. l'm all in. - You don't mind if l wait here? - Certainly not. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Er, getting ready to eat? - Yes. Would you care to join us? Would l?! Say, l'm so hungry l could eat a horse's neck. Get up, Stanley, and let the lady sit down. And fix her something to eat. Sit right down, madam. That's it. (Hiccups) Where are you going? l'm going to look for a horse. (Hiccups) Sit down. (Ollie, Stan and Mrs Hall singing raucously) ## Da-da-da-da. Pom-pom!

What's going on here? - Oh, baby! - Don't baby me. - What are you drinking? - Good ole mountain water. - Good for your nerves. - Yeah! - You get out of here. - l don't wanna. - l said get out... - Don't talk to that lady like that. You shut up! Get out of here! Come on! Get out of here and get in the car. - Bye, fellas. - Bye! Pom-pom! Come again. What do you mean getting my wife drunk? Ha-ha... Ooh!
