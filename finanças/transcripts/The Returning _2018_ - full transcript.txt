Okay. Okay. Don't forget to check your carabiner locks, alright? Hey! It's good. Right, guys? Hold on! Hold on! -Help! Help! Colin! -Hold on! Hold on! Don't pull it! Colin! Hold on! Hold on! Okay. Go up! Quick! -Help! It's very good. -Hold on. Hello. -Good evening. Is this Mr. Colin's house? -Yes, that's right. Mrs. Natalie, I'm from the SAR Team. We have just received a report from Mr. Ardo that... ...your husband fell off a cliff during a climb. At the moment, our team is still searching for your husband. However, seeing that the terrain is quite dangerous,... ...it is unlikely that Mr. Colin is still alive. Mum? -I hope..... Mum? 3 months later. Go away. -Why are you so arrogant? I can't concentrate when you are around. Seriously? What do you want? There you go. Now I'm more handsome. Colin, they say it's taboo for the bridal couple to meet... ...before the ceremony starts. Since when do I believe in superstition? So, what do you want? -I'm not allowed? If I read our marriage vows now,... ...it's okay, right? You still have an hour and a half to make corrections. What if I were to share it? Well, then you have to say it again from the start. From the start? From the start like three and half years ago was only yesterday? I think one and half hours isn't that long. No matter what happens,... ...I love you. Have you checked Dom's homework? Since when has it been my responsibility? He is your own brother. What's the matter with you? I have my own things to do, Mum. Things like staying up late every day on the phone with... ...Ricky till night time? -Just because you sleep... ...in my room, doesn't mean you can bother my privacy. Alright, tomorrow onwards I'll sleep alone... ...if that's what you want. Grandma called earlier today. She asked us to come for a holiday this weekend. I can't, I still have a lot of work to do. Grandma said we need a refreshing change, Mum. After Dad passed..... -Maggie! What did I do wrong? I'm just saying the truth... ...and you can't accept facts! Dad. Maggie, there are times in life,... ...we are faced with two choices. Choose to wait or dare to take the initiative. Which one are you going to choose? Depends on the situation, Dad. If it's like now, how? Perhaps it'd be better if we wait. -Wait? Whereas your badminton game is about to start? Are you sure? Okay. How about if we take the initiative? Dad, you mean we have to get wet? There's always a risk for every decision we make. Okay? Maggie, come on. Maggie! -Dad, wait! Dom, tonight you'll sleep with Maggie, alright? Sleep soundly, alright? Hi, Sweetheart. You can't sleep? Come here and sleep with me. Dom, listen to what the teachers in school tell you, alright? Don't fall behind on your studies. Did you report to Ricky last night that you're sleeping alone now? Why aren't you eating it? Maggie, answer me when I ask! -I'm not hungry. I can eat at school. Dom, hurry up! We can't be late! Don't shout at Dom or he will choke. There! Uncle Ardo has arrived. Let's go. Hi, Uncle. -Have you said goodbye... ...to your mother? -Yes. I've been calling the house for the past few days but... ...it seems your mother never picks up. Why? I don't know. Perhaps she was busy, Uncle. Is there anything you want me to tell Mum? No, I just wanted to know how you guys were. Last night I dreamt about Colin again. I feel like he's still around somewhere but I don't know where. Do you want me to send you to Dr. Mel tonight? Perhaps you've to meet someone who understands about this trauma... ...after such a devastating loss. Am I sane if I'm still hoping he will return? Perhaps it's true, right? I have to see Dr. Mel. Don't keep quiet if you want some company, alright? There's no need. It's alright. Anymore orders? Not at the moment. You just get some rest first, Natalie. Try to arrange some recreational time with your children, alright? Din, that lesson was really hard, wasn't it? Yes, it was. Maggie, I'll go first, alright? Okay, bye. -Bye. Maggie, let's go play basketball after school. I already have plans, Hendra. -So, you want to go out... ...with him when your family just had a tragedy? Don't bring up my family, Hendra. Nothing to do with it. -But you've only known him... ...for 8 days. -And you've known me for 8 years. So, you shouldn't stop me. Melanie Pribadi, Clinic & Psychology Consultant. Mrs. Natalie? -Yes. Please go in. You're expected. Losing someone is indeed not easy. You may experience hallucinations... ...such as hearing his voice,... ...feeling his presence at certain times. But it is not a big problem. You have to give yourself time to accept this fact... ...no matter how long you need. At first I thought work and the children would be able to... ...distract me. Apparently not. That's very reasonable, Natalie. Even though you are no longer... ...a wife but you are still the mother of your children. Focus on them. They are your future... ...because we cannot turn back time to what it was. I was even thinking of taking sedatives or alcohol. That won't be able to solve the problem, Natalie. So, did you do it? -No, doctor. I thought of Maggie, Dom,... ...what would happen to them without me. Good, it means your consciousness is still high. I'm sure as time goes by, you will soon get better. Focus on the positive things. This is your medication. Thank you. -You're welcome. Mrs. Natalie, sorry. I forgot to return your identification card. Thank you. -I seek my leave. Mum, how come you're home? Where are you going? Ricky has been waiting since just now. That's not what I asked. Mum, Ricky wants to invite me out to the movies. It's his birthday today. No wonder my daughter is so beautiful now. But there is something missing. There. Now you're ready. Mum, thank you. Answer honestly when someone asks you, alright? Normally if you start lying, there's a tendency to keep lying. Yes. -Don't come home late at night. Alright then. I'll be going now, alright? Bye. -Bye. Wake up. Dom? Maggie, you said you wanted to go to Grandma's house. Mum, I won't follow, alright? -Don't argue. You promised Grandma the other day. But this is Grandma's house too. She will come here as well. Not quite like that. Come on, wake up. Wake up. Oh, gosh! -Hey! Hey! Maggie! Why are you like that? You must be ready in 15 minutes. Come on, have a bath. Come on. Dom! My grandson is so handsome. Okay, Miss. Let me carry it. How are you? -I'm fine, Ma'am. There's my granddaughter. How are you, Mum? Incidentally, I am making satay. Come on, let's go in. -Yes, let's go in. Grandma, is it done yet? -Why? Are you hungry? Yes, I'm hungry. -Don't play too long. The children have grown so fast, haven't they? It feels like it was only yesterday I was guiding them... ...as they walked. -Yes, don't realise it. So fast. As fast as Colin left his mother and his children. I'm sorry for your loss, Natalie. A loss to all of us, Mum. How about your work? Are you starting to get a lot of orders now? I know it's not that easy to be a single parent, Natalie. So, if you want to leave the children here,..... There's no need, Mum. You don't have to worry. It's nothing, Natalie. I'm just offering. After all, they are my grandchildren too. Yes, Mum. I understand. But I'm sure I can take care of them myself. Mum suddenly asked us to go to Grandma's house. I'm sorry I'm just telling you now. It's alright. I just miss talking to you. How's Hendra? Is he still sulking? Yes, I'm still just upset. He doesn't want to understand. When in fact think about how long we've been friends. Have you ever thought about it? That perhaps Hendra likes you. You're talking rubbish. There's no way, Ricky. He and I are like siblings. -You're acting like... ...an innocent girl, is it? -So, this is your reason... ...for getting close to me? -Of course not. You are different, Maggie. You are special. What are you talking about, Ricky? Come on, come here now, alright? What's with you? What nonsense. Ricky, by the way, I'll call you again. Grandma, you've been there for quite a while, right? Long enough to see you smiling by yourself. One day,... ...introduce Ricky to me, alright? There you go, you were eavesdropping. I'm embarrassed. -That Ricky... ...must be handsome. Grandma. Natalie? Natalie? Come and eat. The children are waiting. Hello? Looks like you didn't sleep well last night. Nightmares, Mum. -About Colin? When will you be willing to let him go, Natalie? What do you mean, Mum? Perhaps it's time we talk about the funeral. Why are you talking like that? -Natalie,..... What if Colin were to return? What if all your hopes continue to torment you and the children? Until when, Natalie? I just want my son to rest in peace... ...and let's not burden him anymore with anything. Mum. -Maggie. Let's go. We'll talk again later, Mum. -If you need anything,... ...don't be shy to see me. -Yes. Come again to my house, alright? -Alright. Maggie, Dom, you guys study hard. Yes, Grandma. I seek my leave, alright? Bye, Sweetie. Bye, Dom. Bye, Dom. Be careful, Natalie. -Alright, Mum. Maggie. Bye, Sweetie. Bye. I'll be red and you'll be blue, alright? Where's the dice? Need to shake it. I'll go first. One, two, three, four. Maggie, please open the door. -Yes, Mum. Here, you play first, alright? Dad? How long have I not returned? -3 months, Dad. 3 months? Dad, look at this. Dom got the highest mark in Art class. Isn't that great? Good. At the time, what happened? I don't quite remember. But apparently my clip wasn't attached properly yet. Colin! -I fell from a height,... ...fell through some trees, then crashed to the ground. Everything was dark,... ...quiet. What I remembered,... ...I saw you,... ...Dom,... ...Maggie. But you guys kept away... ...until I couldn't see you guys anymore. Mum? -Colin. Sit down. I thought you had died. I'm still here for Natalie,... ...for my children. -I also need you. You cannot go before me. -Yes. Lucky, right? I haven't seen my own grave, right? What is this boy talking about? What have the doctors said, Natalie? It seems there's nothing serious, Mum. Just told to do an X-ray and waiting for the results now. How fortunate, right? That I insisted on telling you to take him to the hospital. We should know for sure his condition. Good afternoon, Ma'am. -Good afternoon, doctor. Mr. Colin, Mrs. Natalie, all the results of the tests... ...are out. Mr. Colin, you may go home now. From the results of the scan, no serious injuries were found. Thank God for that. Doctor, thank you. Yes. -Thank you. Mum, why are you always like that with Natalie? Don't accuse your mother... ...of not being able to make peace with her. Your mother here is just worried about you. Are you eating well, getting enough rest? Isn't that so? I'm no longer a small child, Mum. Mum, you have to believe,... ...I'm in the right hands. Just as I believe I was raised by the right mother. You're very good when it comes to talking, aren't you? Don't wake him up. Let him rest. Mum. I think this necklace suits you better. Well, this is odd. What's this for? This gift will not change anything, Natalie. Alright then. You guys just go home. Colin still needs to rest. Sweetheart, wake up. The kids are making noise outside. Mum, Dad burnt the food. Come have breakfast. Adjust his bow tie. Done? Everyone ready, right? One, two,..... Smile. Look at the camera. Dom? Dom? -Dom! Dom! Dom! Dom? Be careful, Dom. -Dom, wait for me! Go after him. Oh, gosh. Give it to me Your son is naughty. Do you remember when I gave birth to Maggie at 21? Then we agreed we didn't want to ask the doctor the gender. Yes. I bought baby boy clothes,... ...baby boy stuff, everything. Your mother blamed me until she intervened... ...and bought everything for Maggie. But that's Mum, isn't it? I told you, these clothes can be used again for... ...the second child or the third child. But what we didn't know is that it took eight years to have Dom. But it wasn't in vain, right? Look at that. Maggie! Dom! Maggie! Mum! -Hi! Gosh. They've grown so fast, right? -Yes. The bigger they grow, that means the older we get, right? I think only you will get older. That's rude. You'll get older too. Whatever it is,... ...as long as I'm with you,... ...I don't care about time. Let's see if you can still say that 20 years from now. Okay. Forgive me. Dom? Dom? What's the matter with you? There's nothing. There's nothing. Come on, go back to sleep, alright? You were just dreaming. Get under. I'm here, aren't I? Here. Go back to sleep. He returned, Yasmin. -Who? Colin? What's the story? Well, he suddenly returned home last Friday night. Then I immediately took him to the doctor. Checked everything. They said there was nothing serious. Why is it a bit strange? Yes, but at least you guys can be together again. That's what we should be grateful for. Yes, thank you for listening to me all this while. How about I treat you to a meal? You're free today, right? -I can't. I've already made... ...an appointment with a photo studio. Next time, alright? -Alright then, if that's... ...the case, I'll take your part first, alright? Hey, you've returned from school. Hi, Maggie. -Hi, Dad. This. As of now, when you draw,... ...this is the limit, alright? This. Otherwise, Mum will scold me, alright? Maggie, thank you for the coffee this morning. Yes, Dad. -Another one please. Alright, I'll make you one. -Okay. Ma'am, please choose which one you want enlarged and framed. I'll leave for a moment, alright? -Alright. Which one have you chosen, Ma'am? This one, Sir. There's something strange, is it? Maggie is beginning to look like you, right? Just as beautiful. Yes, you're right. If I didn't look like Mum, who else would I look like, Dad? Let's play Scrabble. -But I'll just help Dom, alright? That's cheating. Are you guys ready? Okay. Okay, if it's this that means I can put this. My first word is..... -Ocean. A little bit more. There is an 'A' and the last letter is 'N'. There you go. -Ocean. Try to beat that. -Oh, gosh! What can I do? -Can you do it? I can, Dad. -If you're not sure,..... Dad, I'm concentrating. -Okay. 'I'. -Okay. 'L'. -'Ikatan'. No, it's not. -What's that? 'Ikhlas'. -Oh, sincere. Okay, that's a good word. -I could do it, right? Come on, Dom. What's your word? Death, ocean, heart, black. -Dom? 'Hu'? Devil. That's a good word. Okay, it's Dom's turn now. -Hurry up, Dom. 'Hutang'. Who has a debt with you? Enough! Let's not play anymore, alright? What's with you? -Mum, what's the matter? It's nothing. Come here, come here. Bye. -Bye. Dom, let me have a look. Let me look at this. Are you drawing instead? Where is your assignment? Enough, enough, enough. Come on, do your assignment. Dad, I'm going to study at Ricky's house, alright? Hi, Maggie. Where are you going? Hey, what's the matter with you? Maggie? -Dad, I'm going to study... ...at Ricky's house, alright? Don't come home late at night, alright? Yes. Bye. -Bye. Hey, your father has returned? Maggie? Maggie, what's the matter? -No, it's nothing. Let's just go. -Okay. Sweetheart, your coat. -Yes. Maggie hasn't come home yet? -She said she's at Ricky's house. What are you looking for? -Now where did I put it? You're playing around. Come on, let's go. Mum? Dad? Mum? Dad? Now the lights have gone out. Maggie? Maggie? Maggie? What's the matter, Sweetie? -Mum. Mum, bats. There were so many in our house, Mum. No, there isn't. You were dreaming, is it? No, Mum. I really saw it just now, Mum. I'm so scared. You were dreaming, Maggie. -Dad! I'm not lying, Dad! There's nothing here. -No. Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Friend, smile? Smile? -It's not funny, Ricky. Hey, hey, stop. Tell me what I can do to make you laugh. I don't feel like laughing. -Hey, hey, hey. Tell me, what's the matter? -Hey, if he's making... ...you be in a bad mood, I can make you be in a good mood. What do you guys actually want? I just want the old Maggie... ...who was open to everything without feeling any embarrassment. My father is acting weird. -Haven't we discussed this? Wait, wait, wait. What are we discussing? Discuss lower secondary students' problem that... ...upper secondary students don't need to know. Is this a discussion about your father? Or perhaps he is..... -Don't be weird. My father is different now. He eats apples in the middle of the night and it was a lot. Now my father also checks more often on Dom and I in our room. Well, perhaps that's not odd. -But the problem is... ...he wasn't like that before. -People can change, Maggie. They won't always be the same. Then, have you talked to your mother? I can't talk to my mother at the moment. Maggie? Wait, Maggie. Dom? How come you're home? Dom? Dom? Mum, tomorrow Dom will be representing school in... ...a painting competition between primary schools. We'll leave earlier to go to school. My son is really great. Hopefully you'll win tomorrow. Alright, Sweetie? Come on, let's eat. -Let's go. Hey. You're not asleep yet? Go to sleep. Colin. Why aren't you sleeping? I've a bad feeling. Suddenly I'm afraid for them. I also can't imagine if they're not around. Go to sleep. Mum,... ....do you think there's something odd since Dad returned? At that time, I accidentally saw Dad... ...eating apples like someone crazy in the kitchen and... ...yesterday Dad was so odd too. That's not even the first... ...or second time, Mum. It has happened before. What do you mean by saying that? I think Dad isn't like how Dad used to be. So, you mean that you prefer Dad to just go and never return? Is that how it is? -No, not like that, Mum. What I meant was I no longer see Dad like how he used to be. Dad is different. Enough, Maggie! I don't want to hear you talk like that again! This is to be taken too, right? -Yes. Hi, Natalie. -Hi, Herman. I'll take this to the car first, alright? Yes, alright. -What's all this, Yasmin? Herman has been transferred to Jogja. Gosh, what's going to happen? Someone is good at acting. Congratulations, Yasmin! He asked me to move away with him. -To Jogja? Yes. -What about the fate of gallery? Well, in the mean time, I'm closing it first. Later, if I don't feel at home in Jogja,... ...Herman has allowed me to reopen it. Don't worry, Natalie. A few of my clients will... ...call you directly if there are any orders. Enough, you don't need to think about me, it's alright. I'll find a way later. What's important is you're happy. Once again congratulations, Yasmin. I'm so happy for you. Hi, Natalie. -Hi. Go ahead and Eat, Natalie. Colin purposely woke up early... ...to make fried rice for you. -He woke up early... ...because he had an appointment with you. You and the children are fine, right? I'm going to ask Colin to go fishing today, alright? Coincidentally, the weather is very good now. I'm just asking that you please don't leave him again this time. I didn't mean it that way, Natalie. But the reality isn't like that. What time will we be back? Hi, Colin. -Good morning, Sweetheart. Good morning. -I cooked this for you. Ardo asked me to go fishing. -Yes, he told me. I can go, right? I promise I'll definitely send him home. Come, I'll take this for you. I'll put it in the car, alright? I won't return late at night. Alright then. -Alright. Bye, Sweetheart. Bye. -See you later. Children, please pay attention for a moment. Your friend Dom has succeeded in emerging as... ...the champion in a painting competition... ...between schools the other day. You must be curious what his artwork looks like, right? Here, this is his artwork. Dom, come here and take your trophy. Does it hurt? Oh, yes. He can't answer. So, why ask him? It's done. It'll heal soon, Dom. Mum? Why didn't you say you were coming, Mum? Do I always have to report... ...if it's just to come and see my grandchildren,... ...in the house that I bequeathed to my son? That's not it, Mum. What I meant was if you had told me earlier,... ...I could have prepared..... -No need to trouble yourself. I'll just sleep in my grandchildren's room. Oh, gosh. How did Dom get injured? His friend tripped him. Maggie, this isn't the first time, right? Can you be more attentive to your brother at school? There's no way I can keep an eye on Dom the whole time, Mum. I also can't possibly enter during classes and know all his friends. Don't you pity him? He's always silent, that's what scares me. Mrs. Putih gave this. Perhaps you're the one who should pay more attention to Dom. Maggie. Why are you just keeping quiet? What's the matter? I'm confused, Grandma. Well, tell me about it. Whatever I do is always wrong in Mum's eyes. Sweetie, sometimes... ...the perception of right or wrong can be different. But if it's something you think is the right thing to do,... ...just believe it, alright? Becoming an adult is indeed not easy. It takes a long and winding process. Yes, but I don't want to become an adult, Grandma. Sweetie, becoming an adult is a choice. I'm sure someday you'll find the right choice. Keep this. Use it if someday... ...you feel you are an adult, alright? It's pretty, is not it? If only you could continue to live here, Grandma. Maggie, any time you and Dom have problems,... ...my house is always open. All you need to do is pick up the telephone,... ...Mr. Agus will immediately come to pick you up, alright? It's like this, Mrs. Natalie. We would like to discuss... ...Dom's progress with you. Perhaps you have heard that..... Yes, I heard. What exactly is this about? Hasn't this problem been discussed often enough? That's right, Ma'am. But the foundation has determined... ...that this school year will be Dom's last school year... ...in this school because Dom is still unable to behave properly... ...like the other children, that is to speak normally. It's nothing really. We're actually worried about... ...Dom's psychological development and we are also worried that... ...the other children will put Dom under pressure... ...if Dom is still schooling here. -This is how it is, Ma'am. I've said so many times that Dom is a normal child. So, don't think he is not normal. All this while, he always gets... ...good grades and even first in his class, Ma'am! Yes, Ma'am. We know. Please calm down first. We, the teachers also know and... ...have never doubted Dom's intelligence. Dom's comprehension is very good and... ...Dom is far smarter than the other kids in his class. Yes, therefore I beg you, Ma'am. Please consider, Ma'am. -I'm sorry, Ma'am. The decision is not in my hands alone. Please understand. You still have a month or two before... ...this school year ends. Perhaps you can try to find... ...a reliable therapist. I understand your intention in calling me here today. Good afternoon. -Hold on, Mrs. Natalie. Yesterday I had a chance to talk to your husband via telephone... ...and he agreed to find a school for Dom. Please talk to your husband. Oh, by the way,... ...I found this drawing in Dom's drawer a few days ago. Mum, me, Maggie, not Dad. Gosh, Dom! You know how long it took me to finish this! Answer, Dom! Answer! Gosh, Sweetie. Forgive me, alright? It hurts, is it? Come here. Why did you have to scold him like that? He's still young. He didn't mean to do it. Perhaps it's time you become a true father to the children. What do you mean? You wanted to Dom to another school without telling me first? That school isn't good for him. He feels pressured. You could have told me first, isn't it? Did you know that... ...I went all out to oppose his teacher to keep him... ...in that school? Why don't you look at this? How long do we have to bear this? You think changing school is free? There are many other schools. There is a way out. -Yes, the way out is for you... ...to find a job and not just doing nothing here! That's not fair, alright? We must accept this problem. Alright? We both must understand. -I've tried to understand. But you need to change! Perhaps I was wrong to risk everything for you. Hey? -I'm going out. Hey! Natalie! -Not to mention your mother! Always blaming me, giving the impression I'm such a fool... ...and can't take care of the kids! -Up to you. Dom? Dom? Dom? Dom? Found him? -No, I didn't. I'll check over there. Dom? Dom? Dom? Dom? Dom? Dom, this isn't your fault. Go home, alright? Alright? Let's go home. Promise you won't run away again, alright? Colin,..... -I found him. He ran away to Mr. Tomas's house. You got me worried. Go inside, go onside. If I wear this necklace, will it be nice or not? Give it to me. Relax, I'm not going to do anything. Give it to me. This necklace is such an antique. Where did you get it? I got it from my Grandma. Enough, give it back. Don't tell me I can't look at it for a moment? Ricky, it'll break. -It won't break. Why don't you believe me? It won't break! Ricky! Give it back, Ricky! -It won't. What's with you? Good evening, Auntie. -Get inside, Maggie. I'm sorry, Ricky. Mum, you didn't have to be that rude to Ricky. He was so nice to send me home. I'm not blind. I could see what you guys were doing in the car. You're not fair. -Fair? You want to know what's fair? Your brother is under threat... ...of being expelled from school, he ran away from home,... ...Dad and I were busy looking for him while you were on a date! Dom. Dom, I don't want to play, alright? Hey! Hey! -What's the matter, Sweetie? Hey! Hey! What is it? -That! What is it, Sweetie? I'm scared. It's fine, Dear. They'll only be at their grandma's for two days. There's something odd. Are you going for the job interview today? What? -The job interview. Yes. -You're dressed nicely,... ...not like a rock climber. I seldom wear a tie. -It's good, it's suitable. You're handsome. Sweetheart? Natalie? What is this? What is this? I will do anything so that you can return. What do you mean? Now you tell me. What should I have done then? Alone, having to face questions from Maggie and Dom. Sweetheart,... ...I don't understand. I can't live without you. That's the woman whose husband had an accident the other day, right? Try consulting with this doctor. Perhaps it's time we talk about the funeral. Am I sane if I'm still hoping he will return? And you can't accept facts! Please follow my instructions, Natalie. I can call your husband back. Please take this book. All the rules are in here. You have two days to decide before Friday night. The perfect time to start the ritual. Natalie..... -Please forgive me. There is a way out? We'll find another way,... ...okay? We will find another way. You should not be here,... ...in this world. Your wife, that agreement,... ...the stakes are lives. -How do you... ...cancel the agreement? You have returned here,... ...so someone has to leave. Meaning? -That is the rule. The agreement that has been made cannot be cancelled. Perhaps there is one thing that can be done. But I dare not promise. -What is it? It's a full moon tonight. Spread this salt at all the entrances. This is the only way to cancel that agreement. And make sure no one goes out or comes in until the sun rises. Go spread it..... -Then find the mark of a dowry... ...in the house because whoever has that mark of a dowry,... ...his life is in danger. Find the sacrificial altar... ...in your house and destroy it. Thank you, Mr. Agus. Gosh, how come you guys are back? Why? -Come here, follow me. Where is Dad? -Come here. Maggie, remove your necklace. Remove it. Maggie, hurry up. Maggie? Maggie? Mum! Mum! Mum! Maggie? Maggie! Dom! Dom, Maggie. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Maggie. Maggie. Dom, what's the matter? Where's Mum? Where's Mum? Where's Mum? Natalie! Dad..... Mum, Dad. -Where's Mum? Mum. -What? What is it, Dom? Where's Mum? -Mum.
