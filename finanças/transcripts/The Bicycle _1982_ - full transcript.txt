THE BICYCLE FEATURING AND ANKE FRIEDRICH AS THE CHILD SCREENPLAY SCRIPT CONSULTANT ART DEPARTMENT COSTUME DESIGN, MAKE-UP EDITOR, SOUND, SOUND MIXER MUSIC ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, SET PHOTOGRAPHER CAMERA ASSISTANT, UNIT MANAGER PRODUCTION DESIGN CINEMATOGRAPHER PRODUCTION MANAGER DIRECTOR Sit down. Mama, can you pick me up early? -We'll see. Before bedtime? -I have to work. Ms. Becker, food money was due last week. -Okay. Sorry? -Bye, sweetheart. Take care. I remembered at home, but then I forgot again. Morning, Mr. Fabian. Morning, Danny. -Morning. Hey, did you sleep well? Let's put your umbrella up to dry. Evening, Ms. Becker. I hope I'm not disturbing you. Thirteen marks altogether. -Shh! Oh, sorry. What? -Lie down. Mommy, who is that? She should go to sleep. -Yes, she should. So, Ms. Becker, you would be well advised to reconsider your insurance coverage. In this day and age many people are underinsured. In the event of an accident that can be expensive. Maybe I'll just cancel the whole thing. -Is that prudent? Think of all that could happen! A burst pipe, or your daughter causes some trouble. Then the garage. -Don't need one, I ride a bike. Still. Do you realize how many bikes are stolen every day? So, your ten marks change. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Well, still excited? This is your day. It'll be one to remember, trust me. I'm really happy for you. Come by for a coffee some time. We can talk about any problems you might have. If you ever need any help... You can always come back to us. -Being a manager is easy: look at me! Some think they've made it when they get as high up as you. The position is an achievement, but it's not everything. Promotion is a luxury, if you know what I mean. Yes, I do. -That luxury isn't for everybody, but you worked hard. Not everyone can. Don't let it go to your head. -And keep your nose clean. Cheers. Hey! -Hello, Susanne! Hey, Lutz! How are you guys doing? Bring some drinks, will you? Hi, Johnny. How you doing? Hey, guess who! Hey, everybody! Let's get things started! Thomas? Tommy! Come on, the toast! Comrade Marlow. Come sit with us. -Over here! Thanks. Well, this is comrade Marlow. Trained with us as a worker. Then did a 5-year course in Ilmenau. Got a mechanical engineering degree. He's been a technician till now. He's really going places. So he's an in-house product. Thanks to the cadre, so to speak. Yes, internal resources. Well then... Here's to work. To unstoppable advancement. You've got to catch up, seize export opportunities, adapt. Yes, complex components. -But you guys provide the cash. In-house ideas, as you just said. Internal resources are the key. Keep at it and you'll go far. I throw an egg into the pan, but with too much butter. I try to pour it into the garbage, and splat, the egg goes in with it. So I just ate a slice of bread. Evening. Three, please. Do you know him? -No. Your guy? Actually, I'm supposed to be upstairs. What's upstairs? I got promoted to manager of technology and production today. Tommy, come on. Get Lotti off my back. -Later. Be a pal. You know what it's like. I'm talking. Leave me alone. -I'm drunk by 12:00, in her bed by 1:00. See you later, I... She does it every time. You know how it is... The driver's waiting. We should go. -Yeah, yeah. The director danced already. Fine with me. Schwabinger's looking after the single women. And Riemer danced too. With me. -With you? And if you count the old man dancing with Elfi and Petra, and the Party secretary showing up too, my brigade did pretty well this time. -So it's my turn now. How about a dance? Every day is just the same. It's all the same mess. Want a coffee? You going nuts again? I quit. -You can't be serious! Do your own dirty work! These are for you. They're very nice. Come on, Jenny. -Thanks. Mommy. We have to get up. -What's wrong? We're not going to work today. Come here. Let's get cozy. Mommy, will you tell me a story? Which one? -The one about the king. Not the king again. -Please. Okay. -Once upon a time there was a king who rode out in his carriage to search for a queen. And a queen came along just then, who was going to a wedding. The king said: Want to get married? And they both said yes. And then they all went with the king to his palace... And a big wedding banquet had been prepared in the palace with lots and lots of music. And the new king and queen danced all night long. And the next morning they fell into bed exhausted. And then? The king said: Because you danced so well I will grant you a wish. I wish for a doll. Mommy, these seats are free. Slide over a bit. Sorry about the other night. That was dumb. My name's Susanne. -Thomas. I'm Jennifer. -Jenny. -Your sundae. -Thank you. I want ice cream, too. -Coffee and an ice cream. I couldn't get away. I quit yesterday. What now? I might get my hair cut short. That would be a shame. Do you have pretty ears? I'd had enough. Needed a break. I'm stuck managing 97 women. Maybe... if you start as a messenger. You'd get to know the firm. In a few years you could get some qualifications. We have plenty of options. Shorthand, typing. 590 gross as a qualified typist. 590? What would I get now? -450. Oh God. I can't offer you more if you don't have a diploma. HIRING MALE MECHANICS, ELECTRICIANS, WORKERS (FEMALE) WANTED: ELECTRICIANS, CARPENTERS... You'll like it here. The pay's good. -Yes. And the extras. Sunday, holiday and night shift rates, incentive pay, an annual bonus. Night shift? It's the only way to fully utilize our production potential. But what shall I do with my daughter? I can't drop her at the gate. She'll have a place in our full-time nursery school. No, that's no good. No, I need the microphone. -Let her sing. Give me the mic! -You can't have the mic. Yes, I can! Give me the mic now! Little Hans... Turn on the mic! Kalle, I need cash. -How much? 50 marks. Keep going! Keep singing! Louder! Quiet! Come on, join in! Keep going. Sing another. Come on. My God, Mrs. Puschkat! Sitting here again? The light's broken too. The world turns. We sit in our rooms. The world turns. And we act as if none of that concerns us. Well... It is God. Someone... must control everything. Oh, I'm not so sure. Maybe it'll work next time. What if there is no next time? Many people think like that. Until it's too late. Come inside, Mrs. Puschkat. I'll make us a coffee. TRAVEL AGENCY CLERK WANTED May I help you? -I wanted to ask about the job. Yes, come with me. We have machines to do the booking. Consultation is our specialty. You see, you have to be good with people. That's crucial. Any foreign languages? That would've been a plus. You could do an evening course. -Yes. I don't take much stock in diplomas. Your approach to things is much more important, right? Maybe you could go along as a travel guide. Perhaps a three-day trip to Prague: guided tour, shopping trip, etc. Once you've settled into the job, that is. Yes. You'll have to see the cadre department. I'll tell them you're coming. Oh Jenny. Do you have a bad cough again? Lie down. Let me get you tucked in. Do you have a fever? I'll get the cough syrup, okay? Lie down. I'll tuck you in. Then the cough can't find you. "The sun rose and she stayed sleeping and slept well into the day. It came to pass that the king went to his forest to hunt. And when his dogs came to the tree they sniffed at it and barked. The king said to the hunters, "Go see what game is hiding there." The hunters obeyed. And when they returned... Becker. This is Susanne. -Susanne? What's up? What do you want? Jenny's ill. Is it serious? No. Flu or something. She's better now. Well, did you take her to the doctor's? Well? I need the money. -But I just sent it to you. You're still the same after all these years. I mean the money for next month, for Jenny. Out of the question. I'll send it on the 3rd, as always. I have to budget, too. -But... -I work hard for my money, too! Are you nuts? -Okay, okay. Watch it! -Knock it off, jerks! It won't work. -Of course it will. It won't. -Look, just show them the key. To prove the bike was locked up. Understand? Then you go and make a statement. Where it was and when. Kuhgasse 3. -No! Where the bike was stolen. Then maybe... -Got a cigarette? Don't interrupt. No, that's staying here! So... Hey, get lost! You old crow! -You stupid pig! Get lost. Beat it. Make it snappy. Or you'll get a fist in your ugly mug. Listen, then you go to the insurance company. Go to the insurance company, then you've got your money, got it? I don't have any money. -If you go to the insurance, you will. And... So. You'll need a bike, of course. You have to say what color it is. -Red. And then the number. Got it? Sure. -Stop messing around. I'll explain. You have to write down: the color and the number. Red is the color of love... -Oh, sort out your shit yourself. It happens. Drink! It helps. I overslept. Hey. Thomas! I thought I'd drop by. I don't have time today. My daughter's sick with a fever. Nice of you to come. I have no time today. -That's okay. We have a job opening if you haven't found anything yet. I found something, thanks. Okay, then see you soon. The claim goes to the insurance and they let you know. You are insured? -Yes. Is that all? -Yes. Goodbye. -Goodbye. You can go straight to the cashier. Date and signature, please. 50, 100, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200... ... 390, 400, 450. Hey, Jenny. -Good morning. Back again? I'll take all that, thanks. I had a bad fever. -Did you? You were really sick, huh? The doctor's note. Bye, Jenny. Wish me luck. If you had called at least... But no... I couldn't keep the position free forever. And since you hadn't called, I figured you'd found something else. Yeah! No, no, no! Where are you going? -Just out. I'll make you angry! Hello. -Hello. Are you looking for me? No, for Susanne. Thought we'd ride out to the country. You have a bike, too? -No, a car. You're married? Me? No. Listen... You should take care of her. Is it serious, or just for fun? I'm not sure if she's even interested. Should I wait? -Yes. Where's Susanne working now? At the brewery. Jenny? Want something to eat? Thanks. Jenny, come here. I don't want to ride anymore. -It's not that fast. Stop. I want to stop. Stop a minute! Lieutenant Sommer. Tell me. Is that wise? -What? All that stuff on the handlebars? You have to use your head. Especially with a child. And on these cobblestones... You can't react quick enough. By the way... Is this your bicycle? Do you own it? -Yes. If you've found it, you could've at least let us know. We're investigating. I forgot. -You forgot. Well... You'll have to explain yourself. Tuesday at 4 p.m. At the police station. Room 34. Can you make it? -Yes. Thomas! -Hi. I heard you're not doing so well? -Oh, I'm okay. You're at the brewery? -Yes, that too. I've got a minute. How about a coffee? -I have to run, but... You could drop by tomorrow night? -We'll see. Or come by on the weekend. That's better. -The weekend? Okay. Hello. Hello. Can I help you? I was told to report here. Becker, Susanne. Come in. Ms. Becker, the police have referred your case to us. They've recommended pressing charges under the Criminal Code, Paragraph 229: simulating a crime. And Paragraphs 159 and 161: fraud against socialist property. Absolutely ideal. I sit here, watch the clock and write something in the book. There's no reading allowed, and radio only on breaks, but you can grow old in that job. A hundred years old. All the sudden, I saw myself sitting there, at sixty. A bit frail. I could've reached out and touched my own arm! I get it. -Oh, you don't get it. I do, really. Sometimes when I watch TV at night and they show pictures of India or Brazil, or even Kamchatka. Then I look out at our courtyard... Maybe there's more to discover, like Columbus and America! No way. -Maybe I could go to sea, join the navy. Four years... Come on, let's go. Now I've got it bad. Susanne! Can I do it? The child... Yes, I... I need her. My heart's beating so hard. I bet he can see it. It's nice being with her. If you stay, I'll have a place to curl up in. Crazy. Then I could talk with you, and it wouldn't be so quiet. I could... It's like a dream. I can't just say "I love you." If only you could have your own thoughts, then maybe the days wouldn't all be the same. Susanne! If only we could talk. It's so hard. Hey, I like you. She's sleeping. Looking for something? -Cigarettes. Do you have any? No. Wait a minute. Here. Do you want one? I've never smoked, not even as a kid. -That's how you look, too. Get me an ashtray? Over there. Listen... Have you ever thought about changing? Changing? What do you mean? I mean we... We could move in together. Yes. Just the two of us, right? -Me, you and the little one. Yes, Jenny. Of course. Yeah... -I can borrow a van from the firm. But... -We'd only need a morning. Let's think it through. It's too fast. -Susanne! Susanne, it's just a few things. Come on! Thomas, stop it! Shh! She's sleeping! It'd be really quick! -No, it wouldn't! Oh, Thomas! Not now. I must be totally crazy. -Oh... You're so wonderfully crazy! Now press a button so everything stays just the way it is. Can't you find us a button like that? Sure. I'll find us a button like that. I could stay with you forever. Morning. This is Lotti, head of the brigade. Susanne Becker. Hello. -Hello. Hello. This is Susanne Becker. She'll be training with us. Hello. Gerda. -Elfi. Petra. -Bella. Rike. I'll be right there. I've added it all up. Copper wire isn't worth it, but we could cut 600 to 800 work hours. Circuit boards would save us a lot of trouble. Not pleased? We have to build a model. -That's what I said. Susanne! Susanne, what's wrong? I had a dream. Because... You don't have to, but you can tell me if you want. Hey. It was in winter. It all started in winter. Jenny was sick and... work was crap and... Everything was going wrong anyway. So I just did it. -What? I said my bike was stolen and collected the insurance money. So? -It's not true. And now they want it back? Was it a lot? 450. You'll have to pay it back. Is there something else? It's gone to court. So, you said the bike was stolen and took the insurance money. Now they want it back? No. It's fraud. Willful deception. Oh man. What were you thinking? If that gets out... -It has already. If the firm hears about it! Man. They'd have a field day with this. It's just what they're waiting for. And I'm right in the thick of it. It has nothing to do with you. -Nonsense. Let's think of what to do. Did you have to do that? Go back to court. -Me? Who else? I can't do it. -I already went once. Susanne, go back and explain you were having a rough time. Jenny was sick, you were broke, you were miserable at work... Now we're together and it's better. You've got your courage back. They'll understand if you explain it to them. Are you crazy? Is that all you can say? Susanne... -I thought you'd help. I want to help you. All you care about is the firm. -It's only because I got you a job. You wish you didn't know me. -That's not true. It's true! Say you didn't know. Say you still don't know about it. Say I lied to you! Say I didn't tell you! But I do know. -Say you just wanted to get me into bed. It's not true! -Yes, that's all men think about! You're a coward like the rest! Be reasonable, please. -No! I'll say you put me up to it! I thought you could help me! I'll say you told me to do it! -Calm down, dammit! I think I know a way. With a bit of luck. We need to speak to the court first. I can do that. Then we'll need the firm's backing. The Party wouldn't be right in this case. Maybe the company union. Maybe I can come up with a better idea. I'll figure something out. Are you pregnant? Did you have a fight? Hello. -Hello. I need to speak with you. It concerns the conflict committee. -What is it about? One of my colleagues. Susanne Becker. I got her a job here and... And now... Now she's involved in a court case. -In your department? I thought you could take care of it, I mean the conflict committee. And you've taken her under your wing, so to speak? Yes, I... I'm living with her. I know. How could you be so stupid? If she were my daughter I'd give her a slap. When I slapped my daughter, she ran off. My boy, too... -We know your sob stories! It's no use talking to you, anyway. What good is it if the brigade fixes everything? Then everybody can do as they please! The brigade just takes care of it. -Come on, do you have to yell? We have to stick together to get ahead. I don't agree with her at all. Aren't you gonna say something? I didn't want to bother you with it. -Too late. We're behind you. The rest is up to the authorities. You're so stubborn. It won't work like this. Then how will it work? Your way? You're always right just because you're a man. Because you studied and earn more? Because you don't get the simplest things. Like what? -Nothing is free. We're all responsible for ourselves. I've never taken handouts. -That's not the point. It won't last if we treat each other like this. Not for long, anyway. Just say it. -What? That I should leave. Sounds like you're looking for a fight. I wonder how long before you hit rock bottom again, and if you find someone you can cling to then! Susanne! Hey, old girl! Gosh, how are you? -Good. Everything okay? -Yes. You haven't been here in ages! Let's go inside. What are the others up to? Danny has stopped coming. Kalle's joining the army. -Oh God. Everybody's doing their own thing. -Susanne! Welcome back, sweetie. Hi. -You good? Yes, thanks. Flipper? The usual, ladies? -Of course. Thomas picks Jenny up from nursery school. We took a boat trip the other week. -There you go. Thanks. I even like my damn job. Hello? Hi, Dad? It's me. What's up, son? Calling so late? Nothing. I was taking a walk. You guys in bed already? -No, watching TV. Did you have a fight? Oh, just a little. But don't tell Mom. She'll only worry. No, what she doesn't know won't hurt her. Is it still the girl with the child? -Yes, Jenny. Jenny introduced me as her dad at nursery school. Then bring them over! Mom's been nagging me about it. We're curious. I'll skin a rabbit and Mother will do dumplings. Great. We'll all come. Sure. Take care, son. -Bye, Dad. Morning. Stop that. It's no use. Not to mention it's 9:00, and we start at 7:00. The same old story. It's high time you threw him out. -But she should see a doctor. And don't say you fell down the stairs. Come here. Do you want to go home? No. -That's the last place she can go. Nobody'll disturb her in the recreation room. A cold compress might help it go away. Come on. -And who will do her work? Well, I bet it won't be you. -That's right. I'd have kicked him out long ago. -Maybe she loves him. That's not love. I'd be scared, too, alone with three kids and broke. Scared maybe, but not broke. Welfare shells out a lot for three kids. -Oh really? One's enough. You've always had it all. Nonsense, but if you can't handle money, you get nowhere. I've always had a small budget. -It's all up to you. Come on. You shouldn't give up so easily. -Nonsense. Not talking to me anymore? -In a minute. If you'd known how stupid I was, you'd have stayed away from me. You're not stupid. I have the copies. We can start. The boss wants to see you. -I'll take this up then. Leave it here. He won't want to see that. Not now. Why the long faces? Did something happen? Yes. Just go see him. You were all fired up as well. I had a hunch from the start. First we make a plan, then we work toward it, not vice versa. He's too fast. Want one, too? -Yeah. ... and then we drew pictures. I drew a birdy, a piggy, a carrot, a cat and a dog. Tobias drew a stop sign, a car, and piggy, a carrot and a dog. Manuela drew a stop sign, too, a carrot and a dog. Thank you. You were a big help. -Don't mention it. Good evening. Goodbye. They've given your case to the conflict committee. It won't be so bad. I'm sick to my stomach. They tricked me. I planned the whole thing and kept it all afloat, and now... I can clean up the mess alone, too. As the new kid, bit by bit. You know how long it'll take? The idiots don't get how primitive our products are. Maybe they can't afford the change. -They're just too lazy! They'd have to adapt. No chance! They'd rather make me look bad. You sit and work every night anyway. -You don't get it. No support. I have to beg for everything. And nobody works for free. How can I pay overtime? Why didn't you say anything? -Because it was my problem. Dammit. I grew up in that firm. They said: Study. We need you here. You can change things. So I studied. I wanted to give up, but they said: "Stick with it, kid." I stuck with it. Now I see through it. It was a real frame-up. Now they pin it on me. If it works, they win, if not, no harm done. As long as everything stays the same. Sometimes your standards are too high. -Not now, they're not. You're right, they're wrong. Just like with us. What's that got to do with it? Your life was a total mess. If I hadn't chased after you, you still would be. I think I deserve your support. -One hand washes the other, huh? Just because you helped me... -What have you done, huh? I raised Jenny. -Yeah... Who will steal one day. I've had it. Susanne. I don't know what I'm saying. It's just because of work. No, I know you. You mean it. Thank goodness we're not married. Jenny will be sorry. Hello. -Hello. Hello. -Oh God. We're getting married. Granny Puschkat! Where is she? Be very careful. I said be very careful. Yes! Look where you're going. Jenny, not too fast. Not so fast! Yes! Yes! Good! Yes! Keep pedaling! Gosh! Yes, that's right. Oh, Jenny! Watch your speed. Watch out! Jenny, watch where you're going! Yes, good! Good! Eyes straight ahead. Jenny, that's wonderful! Good, keep going! Now to the left. Yes, good. Great job, Jenny! Watch the car! Watch out. Slow down. Hang on, I'm coming.
