Peteronel... Peteronel, wake up! Go... Jesus, wash yourself! - Good morning. - Good morning. Heavens, it's so late? Hello, Maria! - How did you sleep, Peteronel? - Bad. Saint Anna took my warm blanket. Is it my fault I'm cold in the morning? Not. Andulka, can't you take sweater and shirt for the night? Jesus, properly, ears too! Veronika, give him towel, please. Jesus, your mouth. - Jesus, where you running? Breakfast? - I'll play with Judas. But don't come back crying again. - Peteronel, come help me! - I have rehearsal. You're late anyway. Hurry. Saint Nicolas, you have so many figs and raisins left? And two sacks of nuts and almonds. But I ran out of potatoes and coal! - Just go! - Going, going! He's coming... Come next to me... Coming, coming... To not embarrass Jesus on his birthday. Let's gaze upon, to angel choir, blowing the pipes, and singing Gloria. Lord preached to star go... - I'd try once again. - Out! It's not my fault, they can't sing, it's confusing me. You, out! Let's gaze upon, to angel choir, blowing the pipes, and singing Gloria. The Angel of the Lord The Count is back! Everyone come! Your grace! - That's it. Drunk again. - Can you hear me, your grace? Stop talking, Josef, take his grace to bed! Cupbearer, I pay for everyone! Go, go! I'll pick it for his grace. - Do you need me, Dorka? - I'll put him to sleep. Go sleep, Josef. If only I had the chance! - Don't worry about it, Peteronel. - I'm trying so hard, mother of God! Archangel Gabriel is picking on me. I have musical ear. Andulka, you should know better! - Did you ground the nuts? - Of course. Peteronel, come help me, take tray out of oven! Anything, mother of God. I'm good at baking. - You'll see. - Yes, you will. It needs grace and... - What are you doing, for God's sake? - I... did... Unnecessary question, aren't you omniscient? And don't say your name in vain! Watch your step, Dorka! You'll break the eggs! I'll be careful, miss Jangles. The basket is so heavy. - Three krejcars, miss Jangles. - Two. - Three. Two! You sold me one rotten last time! You have to show them! Everyone thinks they can rob us, when shopping for castle! You think Count will be up when we're back? When his grace parties at night, he has to sleep longer. But he'll get up for dinner, as last time. Don't talk like that! His Grace is more than a God to you! - You're not allowed an opinion. - Just that he's a merry man. But poor man will be alone for Christmas, right? He'll celebrate at neighbours. He won't stay here long. No no, he won't settle. Spending a lot all the time. He needs to get married. That calms everyone. Even mister butler will change when putting ring on my finger. Miss Francka, you're getting married? Not yet, but he's in the good age, wealthy... Ah, miss Jangles! Shopping, shopping? Shopping. Aren't those counts' trees, reeve? Counts'? Me, on counts'? What do they think of me? That was mister butler. I do as he says. - You share ducats fifty fifty! - How fifty fifty? Mr. butler half, half of my half plus taxes. Miss Jingles, I'm basically stealing for free. Just between us... Mr. butler bought a ring with a pearl. For who? Quick quick, Dorka! Where are you? How can I bake without raisins? - They had nice, miss Rosa. - They were drying them there? - They're good. Do you want? - No. - Would you rather an apple? - Yes. What's up? You look tired. His grace returned in the morning. Well, girl, you'll get used to it. Since Mrs. Count died, his mother, you know, he's going to the dogs. It's difficult to be without your parents. But it wasn't like this. I remember him this small. I always called him Maxmilian... He was coming here to drink heavy cream. Yes, until her grace was alive, young man walked the line. - Here, bread with butter. - Thank you. But he's quite nice. But he hasn't learned to take care of the estate. And butler will rob him of all, that's sure! I'm always right in this. Always. Rob of all! But don't you tell anyone! Be glad there's roof over your head and you don't beg! What's up, Dorka? Who'll bring count breakfast? I'm not doing it on purpose. Good God, you must've seen it. I'm always so careful. Trying so hard. But nobody stands up for me. If I had a chance to show myself. A bit of trust! Why didn't you come to me? Saint Peter went for carps... Yeah, saint Peter went for carps. At Heaven's gate? Me? You deserve a chance. Bit of trust! Oh yes, yes. But right at the gate? It's nothing. Spirit comes, you check its conscience. You consider everything and let them in, or whoosh to hell. - Urias will help you. - Hurray, Hosanna, God. But that's a hell of a difficulty. - I trust you, Peteronel. - I won't disappoint you, God. No sinner shall pass! Don't spoil him, Urias! - I hear you're dumbass. - I'm not talking to devil. - Angel, you have a customer! - Me? You. - Good day. I mean, God bless... - Till eternity. - Conscious! - Here, please, Mr. Angel. Vomáčková Terezie, widow. Born Kožíšková? Yes, pretty please. Kožíšková. Says here: terrible gossip. Talked behind everyone's back. What a big sin! Oh my God, must be also something good... - Don't call him, sinner! - Stop slowing down. On scale with her. - No need with gossip. She's yours. - No, Mr. Angel, not hell... How about you. Conscience! Hey, put the flower back! But I'm honourable abbess Magdalena. I belong to Eden. - Yeah? Childhood candy thief... - Candy. And tied. - Lied, idiot. - So she's, Urias, also yours. I'm abbess. Honourable abbess! And you? Conscience! Lorenc, that's my name, Mr. Angel. I was beadle, my whole life. - What was that? - Beadle. Beadle? Also clear! I have to argue with saint Peter about every murderer - and you give us abbess. - Gotta be consistent about sins. My words, angel! We worked a lot, how about... - This? - Ew! Devil's cards. Devil's? Why you think they call them "marias"! Ave Maria...s! Get it? Maria, hosanna! So? One game? What were you doing there? Just brought his grace his breakfast. Breakfast? I hope you didn't steal! - They steal a lot here, you know. - Not me, never, Mr. butler. I hope so! You better try, Dorka! I don't tolerate freebies. I'm very grateful, that you employed me here. Since daddy died and cottage burned down, what would I do? Remember that well, or you go. So, be honest, do you have a boy, here in the castle? - No. - No? I swear, Mr. butler. - How come the mistletoe is not hanging? - Immediately, miss Jingles. Can you imagine, four silver spoons are gone again. - Again? - Four spoons! We'll catch that little thief! Shall we go? To check the bills. And you hurry! There are lots of dishes! - Knock! - Lunch break! Play carefully! And trump and trump and ace and ten and king and o-oh. - Hurray, hosanna! - Hurray what? - Hurray to the God. - Alleluia! You play cards on duty and souls are waiting! - None deserves going to Eden. - How do you know? All I checked so far went straight down. Show me the consciences. They were not fit, I swear to God. Vomáčková was gossip and abbess... Vomáčková raised ten of hers kids and four of adopted! Abbess ran orphanage and Lorenc never hurt anyone. - But then anyone can go to Eden. - There's enough space. But then it's no reward. We can just keep the gate open. That's not true. I can't take responsibility for this. There has to be more strict approach. A finer sieve, to not let any pleb in. It's difficult to led a totally spotless life. Exactly. That could be, move, prevented, move, if you cared more about humans already on Earth. You think I should control every human step? Not a blade of grass moves without your will anyway. Maybe you're missing something or don't... Are you trying to nag God for creating the world badly? I wouldn't dare! I just want people to separate to good and bad already on Earth. So it's clear! That is in your power. The silly words will get you a punishment. You have one day to make a mortal change to good and repentance. Or you go to hell with fallen angels. This clock measures your time. When it finishes, I myself count your sins, Petronel! Dear God, now, on Advent? You'll go to Earth as poorest of poor. - You'll see how you get by! - Have mercy, my God! - Say hello down there. - And you go with him! You were to supervise him, not to tempt him! Don't stand up for them! I know, what you mean. "Love your neighbour." You know, what I say, Maria? Nobody makes an idiot of me! Thank you, good... Stinker, it's your fault! - Mine, yeah? - Well, is it mine? I'm in trouble too. I registered those three souls, assigned kettles, hell fire... Where do I get substitutes? Oh please, big deal! Hell is no threat to you! Peteronel, here! Don't say devil is heartless. What is it? - Devil's business pouch. - Should I carry your business pouch? No, you say a wish and tap it, like this. Ew! The cards were enough for today! I don't want no more of the devil's mischief. - Mischief? - Yes, mischief. - What will you do, smarty pants? Time is running, sand is pouring. Where do you get your sinner? We angels say two or three prayers and we get what we want. - Aha. - You don't believe it? - No. - Watch me. - Watching? - Sure, watching. Watch. Dear God, give me quickly one rectified sinner! - I guess he's busy. - Shouldn't have upset him. - You, Urias... - Yeah? How is it... How does it... do? The pouch won't do for you. Only for mortals. - Then it's useless to me. - You think? If you find out, what they want, maybe you put them right through that. But you'd have to go among them, nightgown. Check them out right, know them, how it goes with them. I'm the angel of the lord! I want no business with mortals. See you down there tomorrow then. At the kettles. Just go, you dirty nasty devil! Urias, wait, where are you going? - To humans. - Wait! You wouldn't leave me alone. Urias, wait! Urias! - For hands, dummy! - I know. Thanks. Sarah, Kristian, hurry up! Come to me! Come already! Please, His Grace, stand the ladder up. Oh no! His Grace, Count, to give ladder to the servant? Please, I can't hold anymore. Let go. - Or I change my mind. - But... You catch me?! Hopefully. - His Grace... - You're so pretty. Also pretty heavy. We feed our servants too much. Good morning, His Grace, I'm bringing some bills, you have to go through and sign. Again. You know, His Grace, bills don't wait, no, no. Just sign, no need to read, I already checked it for you! You just sign, no reading, no, no! Hey you, want apple? It's full of sinners here. I smell that from afar. Chill, within half an hour it's all saints here. I rather wait here, to catch you, when they kick you out. Begging forbidden - Laudetur Jesus... - Forever, father, but... - Even mendicants? - Even those. But tomorrow is Christmas. Not even bowl of soup? If it was just me... But Mr. butler... What's going on here? Your Grace, please, at least small almsgiving. I don't have a penny! Catch this, have what count's horse has. What does the sloven want? What sloven? I'm God's messenger! There's always many of them around Christmas! Forgive me, Mr. butler, he's completely frozen. - And it's Christmas... - Yes, time of God's love! - And you, vain sinner... - Vain? Out! Or I let the dogs out! Dogs? You're just the sinner I'm looking for! On your knees and beg our God for forgiveness. God's messenger? They don't have other hobos in Heaven?! - You'd let soaked one freeze... - Begone where you soaked yourself! Remember, girl, tomorrow is Christmas Eve! Giving to the smallest of small is like to give to God himself! I'll give you Christmas Eve! Shoo! God's messenger, Mod's gessenger... Angel of the Lord! I'm an angel! Beggar, push off! Away, rogue, dirty... Sinners! You all are stubborn sinners. - But Mr. butler... - This is no place for beggars! Sinners! Just wait, I'll fix you all! I'll show you... right path! You'll see! Ah look, fallen angel. Soon, isn't it? No way! I couldn't hope for better material. They're all lambs tomorrow! And then hurray up! What about hurray down, my friend? It's not that bad there! Warm, smelly, cards! What, Peteronel? Now I'm doomed, I can't ever go there. Only miracle can save me. Father, come! - I'll give you food. - Yes, it's working... - Mr. butler. - What's up, miss Francka? We're all work and no time for a nice talk. Isn't it, Mr. butler. Or rather... Methodius? Rather butler. You know people, they start talking. - What about the wood? - What? Reeve is sending hello. They had full carriage. - What is it to me? - Nothing. What would be? Apparently, you bought a ring with a pearl, in the morning. - For who was it? - You'll be surprised, miss Francka. - Nobody finds you here. - That's your chamber? Nice, isn't it? Dry, warm, soft bed. Well, dry, warm,... Jesus, that's a hard bed, like a plank. I'm used to lie on cloud blanket and sheets of dawn. You're so funny! I'll find you some clothes, father, to warm up. That was my daddy's. Thank you. Kind girl, kind... Why is everyone so cruel here? Cruel? You know people, don't you? Everyone chasing what they want. They don't notice their heart turned stone. - What's chasing the one with broom? - Francka? Money, I guess. Yeah, and the butler or that little Count? Mr butler grubbed enough, but he'd like pretty, young, woman. Pretty, young... - And count... God knows. - Knows what? He paid for the whole pub. He wants to be broke. Yeah, be broke... He again came under the table. Sssh! You never know who hears you! If God had such good ears to hear everything, - they'd soon break! - Blasphemer! But father! Does God have so little work, - to be mad for every word? - You'd be surprised! Dorotka, what if everyone got what he longs for? Then everyone would be like an angel in heaven. What about you? You don't want wealth? Full pantry, soft bed, rich groom? Who wouldn't want? But this is enough. And about groom, rather kind than rich. Wait father, I'll get you milk and cake. God will reward you, girl. And it's done! Rosa, can I get a bit of milk and a cake? Didn't I tell you to eat properly? You're stick thin! But you should eat it here, so miss Jingles doesn't see you. I'll be careful. Thank you. Bring the cup back! Francka counts dishes every evening. Oh God, poor girl. Where are you carrying it? I... just... for me. For you?! Lunch wasn't enough? I thought, when His Grace didn't have at breakfast... We'd give it to pigs anyway! But not milk! So much?! I hope you weren't stealing. Silver spoons, huh? - But, miss Francka... - Show pockets! - Tin? - That's mine. Beware of me, Dorka! Beware! Father? Urias! Urias! Urias! - Shall we wait with dinner? - I'll come when I'm bored. I wish you the nicest Christmas... Remember to prepare the contract, we do it right after Christmas. If Your Grace hasn't changed his mind, it'd be honour for me to buy the properties. You're treasure, Mr. butler. 300 ducats, as we settled? - Yes, yes, exactly 250. - You said 300. - Three hundred? - Yes, you said three hundred. - Your Grace, how would I have 300? - Then 250, so you don't lose. Your Grace, 240 will be... - 250, I'm forgetting... - Have a nice time. Your Grace... Are you still mad? - What's your name? - Dorotka. Dorotka... Urias! I know, what everyone wants! Francka money, butler to marry the prettiest girl, a count, imagine that, wants to be broke. What are you waiting for? You have pouch, three sinners, hurry! Now Francka, ladies first! Damn! Flash, stop! Flash! Dammit, Flash, stop! Move, sluggards! Of course, I have... Here you go. Done! Francka, butler and count, all got what they wanted! I'm leaving to closest church, waiting for my ascension. From altar straight up! Wait! I'm going with you! I want to see you, flying straight up! I knew you were stealing, but that much... But I... How dare you, Mr. butler? I have no idea, how it got here. Me and stealing?! - And what is this? - That is... I'll have to tell the count. And I'll tell him about the properties, that you're so selflessly buying from him! Selling the whole estate for few coins. As you wish! But when he's not here, I'm the law! And I'll send you straight to prison! Josef! No, God, Mr. butler, Methodius, Metty... You wouldn't send me to pillory. For few spoons... I promise, I'll never... - I'll do anything. - Anything? - How about bringing something somewhere... - What? Where? To Dorka's chamber. Look... - What horsey is running here? - Isn't it count's? Not anymore! He won't notice one horse missing! He hasn't noticed that half of his forest is. Reeve will be happy! What a sturdy horse! Hey, give me back my horse! - What? - That's my horse! You beggar dirtbag, how dare you?! Are you crazy? That's my bay horse. - Slowly, slowly... - Reeve will show you! Let go! You'll pay for this! I'm your count! My money... all my money is gone. - My whole dowry! I've been robbed! - Did you look properly? I searched everything. They're gone. Dorka, have you seen someone entering my chamber? You went around, haven't you? With milk and cake. - Yes, but... - Why are you lying, Dorka? - Did you go or not? - My whole dowry... You can see my chamber, but I didn't take anything. What did she do in kitchen? Wasn't there for hunger! - So what were you doing? - I can't tell. How come can't? Spill it! Now! I let the monk here, that you kicked out. Let him in your chamber? Without supervision? You don't believe that, Mr butler. To lie like this! Those are mine! - And spoons from kitchen! - God, how did it get here? Look! - What is... - That's from my mum. She played poor orphan! What a shame! Thief! Miss Jingles, mister butler, I didn't steal. For God's sake I'm begging you, someone had to put it here. - I would never... - Silence! Now the reeve will ask you! In the prison! Josef! People, I'm your count! Don't you recognize me? People! - Shut up, you beggar scum! - I'm your count. - Come on, people... - Come! - I'm the count of this estate! - Move! - People, I'm your count! What to do with you, sloven? - I'm the count of this estate. - Hush! You have permit for begging? So let's count it. Lies, vagrancy, false accusation of beadle of horse theft... I'm your count! Your master! And you're stealing count's wood! Mister reeve, how does he know that it's count's? - He's somehow cunning. - You're right, Mates. - It's weird. - He could talk... I'd hang him, to be sure. - You never know. - But for what? You don't want us to come feed beggar on Christmas Day. - And to spend municipal money! - Right, municipal money! You'll hang tomorrow! His Grace decides about executions! That's a law! Only the count! Did you all get mad? You can't just hang me! It was easy, huh? That's when you know your stuff! - Don't crawl behind me. - Devil in the church? But it's a shame, I won't see you flying up. - Such a shame. - It is. Thanks a lot for the pouch. Take care, Urias. I'll send you from up sweets. Stay with God! That'll be fast! Mother of God, let me be quickly back up. I think I fulfilled my task. It was fast, so... Jesus, mother of God, what have I done? Peteronel! What have you done? Where's your rectified sinner? Hell is opening its gate! You haven't fixed anyone and threw honest girl into despair! - You're the biggest sinner of all. - Me, mother of God? Why me again? You stopped trusting in God's help. Turned for help to hell! Helped yourself with devil's pouch and all that you did with that only multiplied bad deeds of mortals! What should I do, mother of God? I don't want to go to hell! Trust God, bow your head! Don't try to save only yourself! Don't be selfish, Peteronel. Then the whole heaven will help. Don't be selfish! What are you doing here? I thought I'll see you flying to the skies at the sound of angel trumpets... Yes, but that later. I got one more very important task. You must've proved yourself. True. I have to save Dorotka. You understand? Yes. And where's she? Dorotka? I don't know yet. I bet she's in prison. - Dorotka in prison? - Yep. - In prison? - In prison! - Would you like pouch? - No way, you devil! I won't touch it until the Judgment Day! No witness tampering, Dorota! Miss Francka said, that you came to service penniless. - That's gospel truth. - What truth? Hundred gold coins under blanket! - Hundred and thirty-four. - Also spoons! - I don't know how they got there. - Who put them there? Holy spirit? I don't know. Mister reeve, you knew my daddy. We were very poor, but we never stole. He's turning over in his grave, Dorka, such a shame. I trusted you! And she did this! You lousy thief! - It's not true! - That'll be a year in prison. And beating on whipping post! Please, not that, mister butler. No, please, I'm innocent. And what if there was honest person, who'd want to wash away her sin? You know what I mean, reeve, honest guarantee. What guarantee? You mean to marry her? A thief? But, mister butler... I'm convinced that you didn't steal, Dorotka. - I trust you! - You'd marry me? So what? Post or wedding? I'd leave her for an hour or two and she's yours. Who sits on the hay here, never wants to try it again. No way! - Satisfied, mister butler? - But not you, right? I don't have to beg any man. I have so much money I can pick my groom! But Dorka wasn't really jumping of happiness? She will, but that won't be your business, miss Francka. What about my golden coins? You'll get them. When Dorka says "I do"! In case you'd like to stop it. Dorotka! Dorotka! You don't recognize me? I held you in my arms this morning. You? Look properly. Still no idea? I've never seen you. - So you stole count's spoons. - I never stole anything. Never! - Now the chase me to pole... - They want to hang me tomorrow! Hang? But I won't let that happen. Won't! And let you out too! And have all the liars and thieves punished! As a count of this property. You are count? You have fever? Have you ever seen our count? Pretentions brat, chasing animals in forests or drinking and gambling in the pubs. He doesn't like anyone, only himself! - And nobody likes him! - Not even you? You also don't like him, Dorotka? Catch! You'll treasure it. Well? Mister butler, you don't mind everyone thinks I'm a thief? Who'd dare to talk bad about my bride? I have something for you. That's my mum's. If you're good, you get it as an engagement gift. - But I... - But careful! If you go tomorrow for the beating I don't want you! You'll have sweet life with me! Like in heaven! Or do you want the whole estate saying, - that shepherd's Dorota is a thief? - Don't do it, Dorotka! I'm waiting! I knew you'll be smart! Wedding will be tomorrow! - No, Dorotka! Don't! - Quiet! Don't get sore throat! Keep voice to pray at the gallows! - Good night, Dorotka. - After wedding, mister butler. Ah, what butler. Call me Matty! All will be different tomorrow. You won't fall asleep alone. Come! - That's it. What now? - How about some saint? - Isn't heaven full of them? - Saint, you're right. We need someone at the door. Like locksmith... - Or... - Or thief! Ah shoosh, you have plenty of those down there! Saint, who could... Saint Peter... He won't lend me the heaven versatile. There's saint Florian, but he's more into firefighters. Peter, Florian, Barbora... Barbara, of course! Saint Barbara got out of prison! I hope she can go inside too... Saint Barbara, please... - Come. - No. - Oh yes. - I don't want to. - You do. - No! It worked! Thank you, Barbara! - What the hell... - No, not hell. Just one devil, Your Grace. - You know who I am? - Sure thing. Such gentility and nobility. Clearly blue blood. He's a fallen angel, but not on his head. - Thanks. - I mean, sometimes. - And you are...? - The angel of the lord, sinner! Angel, devil... - I must've gotten mad. - You didn't! Stop slowing us. Where's Dorotka? Butler took her away. He'll take her to altar tomorrow. Good job, indeed! Proper sinner rectification! I couldn't do it better myself! You're supposed to supervise me, not push the devil stuff on me. Just use the round thing on your neck. - At least I tried! - Well, you can tell! You give greedy woman money, heartless possessive man prettiest girl in country and make one dundy homeless, so what? - What dundy? - You wouldn't guess! - That was you two... - Not me! - Here the heaven's professional! - What have I done to you? Why did you do it? They'll hang me tomorrow. Yes. No. I tried to save you from hell. - Dorotka too, you dumbass? - What dumbass? - You have to help me. - My help is paid by soul. - Doesn't matter. I have to save her. - You're suddenly so... - What? - Caring... - Sure, caring! You didn't know her name this noon! But now I know! And won't let him have her. - And you... - Me what? - You have to help me! - Angel has to help people! - Yes, that's true. - But how? We have to go to castle... - No, first out of here! I wish I was thirty miles away. Thirty miles? No problem. Didn't I tell you to leave the damn pouch? How did you want to get out of prison? Angels are trained to get people of prison. - I wanted to castle. - You wanted thirty miles away! - Jesus, it's just a saying! - Don't say the lord's name in vain. I don't want to see the pouch anymore. And you either, hellish rascal! You know what, smarty pants? Show yourself! And I will! Can't be worse than with you! Let's go. - Where? - Where? To Dorotka! Where else? Or you lost interest? How many you said? Thirty? - Three wouldn't be enough? - Could be three hundred. Get lost! Ouch! Damn! - Angel, you know, what I see? - Don't you say it out loud! You barely got better and would ruin it! You know I see the same? We'll never get there like this. Never. What have I done?! Dear mother of God, won't anyone help me? Can't we turn on the light? Turn on, right. Saint Lucy helps us to see. Lucy, please, help. Thank you, saint Lucy. - Dorotka, what's up? Get up, bride. - Rosa... God, child, you look terrible. It will be good. Butler is rich, he'll spoil you. Or you'd rather be beaten? - Much rather. - Then why did you agree? So people don't think shepherd's Dorka is a thief. God, girl. Cry it out. All men are the same, you can't choose, old or young. Every woman gets used to it. In a year you won't realise. Or you were thinking about someone else? Pluck thirty chickens, twenty geese, fifteen turkeys, make two hundred pies, fifty cakes! Josef! Roll out wine barrels! We're having a wedding today! - What now? - If only I knew. If we could walk on water! That can do only our young man. He's elite, I can't ask him. - Frozen? - Yes, I am. - No, but three... - Who? - Pankrac, Servac... - Bonifac? Guys, be that nice and make... yes? Let's go, hurry! Work, work, quickly. Come on! Are the chickens baked? Put more plum jam, Rosa! Move, Josef! And no sipping! Quick! Quick! Parson is here within an hour. I keep my word. I can't! You have to. We have to stop the wedding. - Get up. - I can't anymore. - You think I can? - I can't save her. - Yes you can. - If only I had my brown horse! - Brown? White is okay? Saint Martin, help us, I'll take care of him. I swear. That's saint Martin's Whitey, but I never drove it. Whitey, wait! Whitey! Quickly Parson, let's do it. What God has joined together, let man not separate. Urias! Wedding is not valid! - What's not valid? How come? - Can devil officiate? - What's not valid? - Sorry. - How is it not? - Dorotka is mine! - Hurry, here! Sit down. Hells, take care of Whitey. - Run! - Follow them, catch them! Hurry down! Come, girl, let's run! - Wait! - Whitey, on guard! - Where are you taking me? - Inside, quick! To church, of course. She doesn't know church. Hurry inside! - Come here, night gown... - Thank you, devil. - I'll wed you. - Let go, I don't want him. Didn't you say you'd marry poor, if he was good? - I did. - See! And he is good. - So stop it. - But I can't... Butler waits outside. You'd rather have him? No, but I have to. Or they'll say shepherd's Dorka is a thief. You can't help me, beggar. You can't marry who you don't love. I'll get used to it. They say every woman does. And who I really want I won't have. Can you hurry? They're here in a bit! So who the heck do you want? - Me? I like Maxmilian. - This is Maxmilian! - I am Maxmilian. - He really is Maxmilian. You? You're a beggar… Urias, pouch! - Angel, you're dealing with hell! - I know. You want Maxmilian, you have him. Dorotka! My Dorotka! Jesus Maria, our count! Your grace, where... Where did you... Come. - Welcome home, Petronel. - I'm not in hell? How come, God? There's no rectified sinner. - There's one. - Yes? Who? You are, Peteronel. You haven't even noticed, have you? You'd sacrifice yourself for Dorotka's happiness. And that's big. What's a little sin compared to that? Forgive me, God. Now I'd judge differently souls at the heaven's gate. I'm sure about that. You yourself avoided hell by a little. What will be with the unrectified sinners? Francka, butler and reeve? Human justice will deal with them, maybe rectifies them. And maybe they'll pass our Heaven's gate. - Jesus, slippers! - Dad, dad! Jesus, you little rascal, come here. Merry Christmas, Jesus! Merry Christmas to you all! Mary, here...
