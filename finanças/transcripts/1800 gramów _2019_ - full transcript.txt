1800 GRAMS Hello. - They are denying me custody. - Calm down, Ola. They say I'm underage and we have nowhere to live. But I'll get a job, so will Darek. The bedroom's almost ready, soon we'll have the bathroom done, see? Ola, you need to make a good impression. Go to the ladies' room and calm down. How do you stay so strong? I drink the blood of handsome lawyers. Do you know this judge? Fond of traditional values. Your Honor, my agency believes the girl should have custody revoked. She's only 16, unable to raise a child, with no home or income. The child's can have a normal life only if adopted by responsible parents. Attorney Raszy≈Ñski. Any questions? No, Your Honor. Thank you, witness. You may now make your case. On behalf of the Adoption Center, I cannot agree. Unfortunately. We believe she should retain custody. Your Honor, a child's rightful place is surely with its biological mother and father. - Your Honor? - Yes. It's hard to call that boy a father in any sense of the role. He's in vocational school, has no job. She neither. Her retired grandmother supports her. Where will they live? A room with an outhouse? They are not even married. Your Honor, may I? Please. The situation has changed. They've decided to get married. It's all arranged. She has court permission. - They'll be married before Christmas. - Really? Yes, it's true. How come I know nothing about it? I don't get it, what now? Go see Michal. A wedding?! When, how, where? Soon, before Christmas. That's impossible! I'll help with the papers. See you at the Center. Goodbye. Know anyone at the marriage office? That's why I like you. So you'll help... I'll try. I'll talk to a judge I know. They have to come, too. - They will. - Early tomorrow. Ok. - Let me know. - Wait. I heard a rumor. The city plans to sell... the land under your Center. - They want to close us? - Yes. At least for some time. Is it definite? Not 100%. I'll try to find out more. Thank you. And one more thing... You look beautiful today. Hello? I'll try to have them repair it. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'll wait for your call. Bye. - Hello, dear. - Hi. See what it's like... Aid going to Sudan and Somalia tomorrow, 20 people haven't slept in two days, only that tarp, but they won't repair it - cause they quit at 4 pm! - Things are crazy for me, too. How's your new boss? Marcin! The top side facing up! It's medicine! Put it here. She's down-to-earth. Do they want to close the Center? I've heard... But it's not certain. Ewa, I really could help... I'll make a few calls, meet for coffee... - If you want. - I don't. But thanks anyway. Ok, I understand. Marcin! You can't just drive stuff around! Check the specifications! I'll show him. Have plans for Christmas? No, why? We are having a charity ball. You two are invited. But I've been single for years. I know. I meant Jacek. Of course. You're in touch with your brother? - I am. - There. So invite him for me, with his family, Marta... the kids... Stasiek and Hela? Stasiek and Hela. They can all come. Was nice to see you. Hey, you'll break that, go easy! Ok! Just five days left to Christmas, the last minute to plan something exceptional. Today's topic is charity. We're talking with a humanitarian expert an amazing, warm and kind woman, mission chief Zofia Wysocka. In a few days, after the charity ball, she will head to Africa, to help those in need. Change the station. The papers say "Ania"... But it can be changed. Are you certain about this? Wait, give her time. - Did she say why? - No money. Payment in two weeks, file it. - And put the laundry out. - I remember. - Scratched off again? - See? How does she do it? I tied that bandage on twice. Check it every hour or it won't heal. Come here, Wiktoria... Adam! You can't run here... - But I'm bored. - Come help me. - We'll feed Zosia. - Watch your step. Check Wiktoria every hour. They left him again. Should I call the children's shelter? No, for now don't. The new boss is coming. She mustn't see Adam. May I? Do you have kids? So pretty! Is she healthy? She scored 10 points. Someone will want her. We can help you. Tough situations can be dealt with. Just tell me the truth. I don't have money. Are the papers ready? Yes. Please hold her. I don't want her alone for Christmas. Can you promise? Only you can promise. - She'll have good parents? - Yes. But you'll never see her. You won't know where Ania is. It's the law. Read the papers and think it through. Ewa Wysocka, at the Adoption Center. Yes, I've called before. Don't say that drug is impossible. Anything's possible... Hello? Hello?! Remind me to call her again in an hour. Hello. Just as I imagined you. Dorota Koleczek, the new CEO. Ewa Wysocka. You're early? I came to look around. And? The cots are too close for regulations. The other room needs painting. Maybe not necessary. Can we talk in your office? Hush, hush... Don't call me. No. I couldn't give her up. It's not up to you. Don't come here. You took that child? Where are you going? I won't let you into the house. You'll never see Julka. Understand?! The Center's in debt, behind in paying taxes... I'm working on it. Yeah, I've heard. Government officials complain about you. If someone does a bad job, I tell them. So I'll do the same. The previous board was awed by your mother's name. I look at numbers. And I'm not awed. I also have a few numbers. For example, 97. 97 children adopted, this year. Only that matters. - Did she see Adam? - No. We should call welfare. - He won't go home. - Maybe it's better... Ask about Santa. Will Santa come? The kids are asking. - He'll come for you. - I'll be home. Tell him to remember us. Bozena, wait, I'll help you. - They're closing us? - You heard? I did. Let's do a big campaign... about what we do. You want to chase celebrities? I need 100,000 zlotys, tomorrow. What's going on out there? Maybe the new boss dropped dead. Were you alone in the car? Wait, here's her purse! - Step aside. - What happened? A woman was hit. - Where's the child? - Wasn't any. She ran into the road? Everything checks out. - The parents give her up. - Both? There was no man. See, two signatures. - Hi, what's your name? - Ania. Ania, I say let's call her Nutka... Nutka. That's nice. - What now? - Normal procedure. Call the hospital about that woman. Ok. - Bozena, help me! - Coming! Nutka... Nice nickname, huh? What do you think? Hey...? - You'll miss your bus. - Ok, thanks. I love you so much. The attorney will call. Tomorrow you'll go to court, then to the marriage office. Darek knows about it? No, he hasn't even proposed. - So propose to him. - Me? Yes. Do you love him? - Yes, of course. - Then you're luckier than I am. So should I buy him a ring? Yes. Buy him a ring. Bye. Ok, thanks so much. Goodbye. Hi, Nutka. Do you like it here? Ewa, Dylewska's here. Hello. Hello. - To see the director, please. - Come on in. - Yes? - I want to see the director. You're not lost? This is an adoption center. - Yes, I know. - Ewa, help? Please wait. - Do you know him? - No. No one scheduled? I advertised for a painter. - And I know nothing? - You said we needed it done. Hello, Maria. I'm taking her. - I still can. - Yes. I can change my mind. You are the best mom she could have. So I'm taking her home. - The court let me. - Yes. But to take her you have to meet the conditions. We talked about it. Do you remember? I do. We want you to be together. How long will it take you? What? Scraping and painting... you know. You came about the ad? Please, I'm in a rush. I'll try to do it. Great, start tomorrow. We need space for more children. I'll try to finish before Christmas. We have a deal. - Wojtek Szadkowski. - Ewa Wysocka. A deal. I'll stay, have a look. - Take some measurements. - Fine. Hi. What's your name? - Wojtek. - Kajtek? That's funny. What are you doing? Cleaning up. Wanna help? All this goes there. What happened to your mom? You won't be alone for Christmas. What are you doing here? Please leave it. Sorry, see you tomorrow. Hey?! - Jacek... - Turn on the lights! - Why are you here? - Hello. - You gave me keys. - Years ago. To water the plants. I'll water the plants and clean! I moved out! Let's order a pizza? One with cheesy crust. No one will eat my crusts. - And wine... - I can't find the corkscrew. I found it. And I put the wine glasses here... Easier to reach. You rearranged? A few things... Such a mess. A nice mess. - Good to see you. - You, too. You look great. I got you a Christmas tree. I needed that. Wine... pizza... and... quiet. Bam! - Why not with Marta? - Give me a break. At home I'm just a cleaning lady... She demeans me. Enough is enough. Cheers! You staying long? It's so good! We'll see. Drink! Hello, I'm looking for a friend. - The name? - Martyna Sikorska. Let me check. How did you find me? Your name was in the papers. Please leave now. What happened? - Who is she? - I don't know. Wrong room, sorry. What's that? Dad got me a coloring book. Let's color. She got the wrong room. - She's from him? - No. From who? You drew some pink trees? From nobody, dear. Julka, let's go eat. - Wait. - They've got crepes downstairs. See you, mom! Hi, Kajtek. Did you see Santa? - What? - Did you see Santa? No, not yet. Hold this for me? Grab the gloves... Come here. Here. Hold it. - It's a bit early, isn't it? - I guess so... Though you never know. In Iceland they have 13 Santas. 13 Santas? Yeah... Only smaller. And they come two weeks earlier. Morning. Night ok? Calm. They slept. A couple's coming to see Nutka. She's a bit feverish. You know, there's 13 Santas in Iceland? - Kajtek told me. - Who? Wojtek the painter. Don't bother Wojtek, he's got work to do. 38.8 degrees. Try paracetamol. Then call a doctor. Did you call Adam's parents? They'll take him for Christmas. Was his mom sober? Please leave! - What are you doing! - Who is this?! We represent an investor. We need to examine the building. Please leave, children are sleeping! The walls can be demolished. Please leave. Your foundation let us come. Am I not clear? Please leave! Spare us the bossy tone. - Here's the consent... - Are you deaf? Who are you? Security. Can I help you leave? Ok, let's go. We'll come back. Thanks. Try to be nice. Wish him and his wife Merry Christmas. And call him "Mr. Mayor"! Mr. Deputy Mayor, Ewa Wysocka here. Are you crazy?! Oh, and Merry Christmas. To your wife, too... Wonderful... I'm honored. And to you, too, a very... Merry Christmas... Goodbye. Journalists... Gotta stay on good terms. These kids can't lose their home. Where will they go? Your house? City Hall? No... Of course not. Thank you. Which tie is better? This or the red? The red is more Christmassy. Yeah, but it kind of looks... - Maybe the striped one? - No. Thank you. There's a meeting at City Hall. "Those women are angels, saving dozens of children. The center is a treasure for the city." Who said that? - I did? - Yes. About us. - Now you want to shut us down. - Ewa... We are not closing the center, just changing the location... To where? That's not yet decided. Look... The land is valuable. The city sells it and we all benefit. How will the children benefit? - Where will they go? - They'll be ok. - So you won't sell the land? - What can I do, Ewa... Ok... I promise I'll try to do something. I said I promise. Thank you. Merry Christmas. The bowtie's best. We are leaving. Did Nutka have a hearing test? Yes, it was fine. Bring it to you? No, see you tomorrow. Listen... - Let's buy a Christmas tree. - What for? A holiday atmosphere? Know what these are? Contrast images. Infants see only contrast, from 20 cm away. A tree makes no sense. There are older kids. We don't have the money. - So it's that bad? - Weren't you leaving? Ewa, they're here. So, you're a screenwriter? Now I run an interior design firm. - My husband's a musician. - No virtuoso. - I'm a sound engineer. - Funny, we call her 'Nutka'. What? Kind of a nickname, 'little note.' You can change it. No, I like it. And you? Me, too. The court formally approved the parents giving up custody. So we can officially adopt her? Even before Christmas.. I just ate and I'm very happy... So sweet. Ok, let's go. Goodbye. Goodbye. They are ideal. What are you doing here? That woman's here. I saw her come in. - The door was open? - I took out the trash. "Lenka, you'll read this as an adult... I'm sure you have a loving family. I couldn't keep you, but... I love you... We all do. Your father, sister, brother... Even the dog Nero. We will always wonder what's happening to you... where you are... what you're thinking..." Can't she her family take her? There's no family. She has a husband, kids... She's schizophrenic. I have four of these, each with a different name. Too big. Ewa will kill you. I'll tell her to shove it. Give her a break. The Center's her life. - A present from mommy. - She deserved it. She's good, but could be less blunt. Maybe on Christmas... That one's nice. - 150 zlotys. - Too expensive. By at least 30. I can come down 10. Come down 20. Ok, it's a deal. Pack it up? Now time for the star of the show! Been all around, till I fell down, frozen and stuck, all out of luck But if I blew like the wind, if I was thicker-skinned Trying with common sense, not to be so dense Here you are. Thanks. I'd put hate in its place, put a stop to the rat race Come feel my heat, wouldn't that be neat? Don't let life blind ya, see all the colors behind ya! Who's that? Obviously, an artist. He used to drink on the streets, After his child was born, he changed. What a clown... 100 zlotys. Love, peace, mutual respect, everyone Love, peace, mutual... ok, everyone loud Love, peace, mutual respect, everyone Love, peace, mutual respect, loud Love, peace, mutual respect, everyone Love, peace, mutual respect Kajtek, pee. - What? - Pee. - Go to the bathroom. - But it already came... Hey... It happens. C'mon. Adam, you're not sleeping? He was showing me around. Wojtek shouldn't be here. - He has work. - You're mad, cause something broke? I'm not mad. And what could be broken? You can't have kids. Come here. You heard that about me? Sometimes things just don't work right. Just like me, I'm broken. I wet the bed, my parents don't want me. That's not true, you hear? Kiddo... Don't even think that. You'll disappear, he'll stay. Don't do that to him. - So pretend I don't like him? - Yes. His parents say they love him, but things happen. Trips, parties, quarrels. Then they leave him here. Nutka's shivering. The drug's not working. 39.8 degrees. Call an ambulance. I'll drive you there faster. I'll get clothes. - Still nothing? - You can go. - I'll drive you back. - Thanks. - Call me Wojtek. - I know your name. You found parents for her. When will they take her? Maybe before Christmas. Who are they? I can tell you when Nutka turns 18. If she lets me. - Is this your dream job? - My mom decided. That's funny. Adam said you were in Iceland? Working in a fish plant. How was it? Slippery and stinky. That's life. In New Zealand, I cleaned sheep pens. If water wouldn't get the turds off, I used a knife. I want to go there... Not with me. I stayed to climb the mountains, my visa expired, I was deported. I don't travel. Unlike my mom. - I'd like her. - You know Zofia Wysocka. Why should I know her? You can come in. Hold this please. Temperature's down. Looks like a small infection. - No neuroinfection? - Definitely not. I examined her, noting disturbing. And her hearing? I have doubts. She should see an audiologist. He's not here now, but bring her tomorrow. Tomorrow? Keep her, it might be serious. It's not necessary. She shouldn't stay. Go home, it's late. Maybe I can help? Wojtek... We're grateful. But don't get attached to the kids. - And you? - Me? You don't get attached? This is my job. You have yours please focus on it. Soon you'll be home? Can you hear me? From the ashes, at small Wojtek A tiny spark is winking Come, a fairy tale I'll tell you A story long and winding From the ashes, at small Wojtek A tiny spark is winking Come, a fairy tale I'll tell you A story long and winding - Quiet, kids are sleeping. - Of course. Oh, the director! Give her make-up. Later we'll post the 'making of', ok? Please don't be mad. We'll record a music video. People will donate money. - A music video? - In the corridor. An interview with you and Boombox. - Who? - Nice place! You are the boss? Respect. - Boombox? - Yeah, hello. Hello, and goodbye. - I don't get it. - What? How about 'get out!'? Don't argue with a lady. - Come on. - Everyone! - Sorry about this. - Eh, don't worry. It's nothing. LPR. Boom. See ya. - Thanks. - See ya. Co tam, co tam? Never do anything without my consent. I won't, we'll be shut down. Maybe it was dumb, but at least I tried. It'll be too late. Do your job. Hello... I can come for 15 minutes. Give them back! They're my headphones! I won't give them! Give them back! - They're mine! - Stop it, Stasiek! Go to your room! Let us talk! They're mine! Sorry. I had to cancel a meeting. They're both home sick, I can't go to work. Get Jacek to come back. - You guys need to talk. - We did! And? He's got a mid-life crisis. - Maybe he's just tired? - He's tired? And me? I'd also move out. - Let me go, dummy! - You're the dummy! Hela, Stasiek, listen. When is dad coming back? - I dunno. - Hela said never. - I didn't. - Let me go! Kids, listen up. I bet your mom you can be quiet. Don't scream for 10 minutes, you'll get a surprise. What surprise? 10 minutes. Angels. How do you do it? You should have kids. What? I have to get back to work. Send him back, we need him. The house is a mess. Did you tell him? - What? - That. That you need him. Buy the kids a surprise. - What? - Think of something. I saw Marta. - How're the kids? - They miss you. This place is a mushroom farm. And your kids are collecting dustbunnies. - Go home. - Marta should apologize. Maybe you should both grow up? - It's not right. - How would you know? How many relationships have you had? Get out. - Sorry. - I want to shower. Unfortunately... You were right. Hello Ewa! Sorry to meet here, Kamil's so busy before the holidays. - Is something wrong? - Yes. We can talk here. Five minutes. So she's deaf? She can't hear. It can be treated? The doctors don't know the cause, but maybe it's not medical. Then what? She's been through a lot. A small baby has psychological problems? She needs a family even more. So with us she'll be healthy? No one knows, but... she might never hear. - We need to think. - Of course. It has to be your decision. There's nothing to consider. We want to adopt her. Are you sure? Yes, 100%. Listen, call that choreographer, and send those invoices, ok? Wait, wait... Boss lady! Boss lady, please wait. Respect! For someone who does good... LPR. Love, peace, respect. My new record! - Give the kids a kiss for me. - I will. One more thing. I truly apologize. Can we talk? Yes, not right now. - It's important. - In a minute. I'll do anything for those kids. Even a bigger gaffe. Seriously. Come to my concert in a month! They change their minds? - No. - That's good. Kajtek, Nutka's gone deaf! Adam... Listen... Nutka is sick. But the doctor will make her better. - What is it? - No idea. - She's deaf? - Remember yesterday? Nothing's changed. Oh god, Ola! I'm her wedding witness, but late... I'll be there... in 15 minutes... Yes. Traffic is terrible. - I'll drive you. - I'll be there. Sorry. - Traffic! - Darek's witness didn't show. - What? - I can't wait. I already bent the rules. Not good for me to be the witness. - Wojtek, got an ID? - Do you? He's my friend. - Acquaintance. Here. - Thanks. I did have it... Let's go. By the powers vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife, before these witnesses. - As a symbol of your union... - I proposed! ...please exchange rings. - Everything's working out. - I'm happy. - Tomorrow I'll file it in court. - Thanks so much. Thank Ewa. Ewa, you are an angel. I hope you'll have Michal for Christmas. You hear? I really owe you. One drink, and we'll be square. It's your wedding, how about a drink? We have to catch a train, and want to see our son. - I'll drive you. - Wait. Take a taxi... It's a wedding present. We'll toast you. Thank you. Goodbye. Let's go. The deputy mayor won't help. They need money. Like you. The money's peanuts for the city. Who wants that land? A few companies. I know people, I'll try to dissuade them. Other centers will take two of my kids. And the rest? To orphanages. Do kids get adopted from there? All of mine do. They get a home, a family... You never stop working? Let's dance. Pawel... This won't go anywhere. I'm sorry. Really sorry. Let's go dance. You know him? He didn't recognize me. Hi. Over there. The usual? Long Island ice tea, old-fashioned, and for her, a whisky sour. You'll like it. The bartender knows you, come here a lot? You know drinks, are you a drunkard? I tended bar. In New Zealand? - San Francisco. - No... A small club in Castro. Here you are. To the young couple! Tastes good. Cuban salsa. I always dance when I hear it. So dance. C'mon... I can't believe it... It's all in the hips. Where did you learn? Probably Cuba? I hate you. You rejected him? That's your business? - I'm your chaperone. - Not a good one. Infants sometimes react to rejection. We think they're too small. But they're... showing they don't accept the world. They stop seeing or hearing. At first, I wanted to leave the center. To resign after a week. Then a little boy came. Premature, 1800 grams. He laid there... almost not moving... Staring, waiting for someone. They took him in a plastic bag. I understood then that one can die of longing. I can't let it happen again. So I stayed. Hello. On my way. What time is it? - Here ya go. - Thanks. I know, but he insisted all morning. 2- Who's the snowman? - A painter, like Kajtek. - Is Kajtek painting? - He left. Don't catch a cold. I'm waiting for mom and dad. They're coming. Adam! The court says it wasn't filed. Your certain? I won't get Michal back. - I'll take care of it. - Thanks. The marriage is not filed. Call me please. I'm taking her. To be home for Christmas. Maria... Come to my office to talk. Do you hear me? I won't go. What's wrong? It's me. Maria... Let's lay down... Where's Nutka? Kasia's changing her. No, Bozena took her. She's outside with Adam. Watch Maria. I want to report a missing child. Not by itself, it's six weeks old! Ewa! Come on, let's go. Hello. - Wojciech Szadkowski, right? - So he said. You didn't check his ID? But they did at the marriage office. Why were you there? As wedding witnesses. - You know him well? - No. What do you know? Not much. He traveled: the States, New Zealand, Cuba. He could know child traffickers. He seemed so normal He smiled, said 'good morning', right? Do you know his address? We'll check it. Hold it. - It's crooked. - You're crooked! Let go! Sorry, Stasiek. Sorry. Are you ok? Stasiek... Stasiek, hey... - Ok? - Are you spying on us? What happened? Let's go! - Stasiek! - They'll kill each other. - We're fine without you! - Fine without me? I shouldn't come back? Stasiek! I didn't say that. - But do what you want. - Let's go! You are fine now. - Stasiek! - Let's keep going. Hello? Yes. I'll be right there. I'm not a kidnapper. I demand a lawyer. - Who're you? - Her brother. - Come by car? - Yes. - Let's go. I demand a lawyer. Relax, you're not a suspect. I demand a lawyer! I demand a lawyer! It will all work out. He asked about Nutka. Her health, that couple. Everything. You think he's a kidnapper? He'll sell her? - He learned to care for her. - Ok, enough. - Why the hotel? - I was there with him. Maybe he left a name. You went to a hotel with him? Stop! Ewa! - It's his? - Sorry, - where's the car's owner? - I don't know. He must be here. Call the police! - Where are you going? - Excuse me! Did you see a man with an infant? - From that car! - What happened? My ex-husband kidnapped our child. Six trains left in 30 minutes. - He could be anywhere. - I'd be gone. - Now what? - Fuck! - Yes? - The name was false. He's Wojciech Olsza≈Ñski. No current address. Adam's parents left him for Christmas. Adam! Adam! - Ewa... - They left him again. Why are we here? He's long gone. You wanted to come here? Let the police handle it. - Hello... - Ewa? Where's Nutka? - Here with me. - Where?! Ewa? I didn't plan it. Yesterday was real. Shut up. Where is she? Relax, I'm going to feed her... I didn't know she was born. I found out I had a daughter. What are you saying? A friend caught me with his wife, so I went to Iceland. Then I heard they want to give her away. I just wanted to see her. You made me into a painter. Ok. So I saw how it all works, I saw that couple, I realized I might never see her again. What have you done?! The best thing ever. Police! On the ground! Cuff him! Don't move! Get her to the ambulance. No sign of aggression or neglect. But...? It's too soon to say, wait for the audiologist... but I think her hearing's fine. Goodbye. Hello. Come in. - Still more papers? - No, but we have to talk. Sorry, work. - Maybe a coffee? - Please. Where's the bathroom? Door on the right. The same thing, over and over? Ok. But not now. I'll call you back. - A big recording session. - It's the girl from the bar? What are you talking about... You adopting is driving her crazy. Who's crazy? I'll make it easier for you. Nutka's father's turned up. And wants to adopt her. What? He didn't know. Some father! - You're joking. - I'm sorry. He has legal priority. Then we'll fight! Honey... Let's let it go... It's cause she's deaf, right? Having a child that can't hear... It's too hard for me. Ok, I have to go. What brings you to my office? It's no longer your office. You're fired, on disciplinary grounds. You took in an older child, allowed in a mentally ill woman, an infant was kidnapped, - you hired an employee who... - I know what I did. I don't like you. Feeling's mutual. But I admit I respect your work. I regret it ends this way. Regulations. You're not broken, you know? You never were, remember that. You hear me, right? Now you hear fine. Someone loves you. You will not be alone. Give me back my daughter! Please sit. She stayed all night, didn't want to move, had a breakdown. They took her to the ward. You had no choice. I feel powerless. Get used to it. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Sorry, can I suggest someone to take over? - No one will take your place. - Thanks. You got me wrong. The Center will be closed. - The land sold. - To whom? Whoever pays the most. Meaning who? If your brother challenges it, it could drag on. But don't worry, we handle such cases. - Congratulations! - Please leave. I'm in a meeting. I'll explain. You'll explain? It's your firm buying the land? Ewa, please go. The wedding's still not filed. Ola could lose her child! Why, because I didn't go to bed with you?! Please stay, she's leaving. Ewa, I'm working. These are clients! - Go. - Call the police? No, I'm going. Straight to the media. With a campaign. Someone will pay more for the land. - Before Christmas? - Sorry, Merry Christmas! And happy holidays to you, and a better lawyer, too. Goodbye. You still could get her back. The couple doesn't want her, you have priority. It's not good that you kidnapped her. You need a very good lawyer. Will you help me? I lost my job. - Goodbye. - Wait! Give me a moment? Now my turn. All my life, I ran away. Until now. When I saw Nutka, I panicked. I wanted to do the same, run away. But you stopped me. You said, don't get attached. You were a bad teacher. - Ewa... - Say no more. It's all thanks to you! Professor, thank you. Ms. Wysocka, thank you. Mr. Mayor... Hello. Ewa! - Thanks for finding time. - Always. Enjoy yourselves. Be right back, ok? - Hi Ewa. - Hi. Hello there, hello. What a success. We've collected so much. Congratulations. You don't look good. Eat. They're closing my Center. I'd buy the land, but it's not my money. All straight to Africa. I want nothing from you. Sorry. Thanks for coming. - Kajetan, enjoy. - Thank you. Hello. - Ewa. - Hello. Don't just stand there. Have fun. You have more time. Maybe you'll meet someone... More grandkids. Why don't you want kids? - I can't have them. - Zofia! I want my daughter to meet you. A model woman, strong. - So nice. - Hello. You're cute. My daughter, Ewa. - Pleased to meet you. - Hello. We'll be going now... - You were tested? - When I was 17. A congenital defect. - Why don't I know? - You were in Africa... helping people. They needed it more. The Mayor insists on a picture. Ask for 5 minutes. I really need 5 minutes. Ewa! Ewa! Hello. It worked out, I can take Michal home! All thanks to you! - Thanks so much. - I'm pleased. Darek's here, too. Hey honey! Come here... Because of her I became a housewife? She abandoned us... Dad cleaned, cooked, took us to school. I thought every guy had to. You do it well. I do, but, I limited myself. Better to be single? There's no other way? We're victims of our mother. That's the truth. If it's carolers, I'll shoot them. Oh, hi... We were talking about you. - Merry Christmas, son. - Aha... From the party. I bake my own. For the kids. What will they eat for Christmas? I apologize. I behaved like a child. You are my child and always will be. Ok... Happy holidays, right? Bye... - Bye. - Bye. I wanted to be like you. But I can't cope. You do cope. Every day, quietly, you rescue one little world. Without expecting in return. Everyone loves you. Everyone... Except my daughter... Your daughter can't love. You can... You can. You have to stop being afraid. - Turn that idiot off. - No, leave it on. He's a weirdo, but really a decent guy. He recorded something for us. He was an orphan, so he helps kids. A lot of money, I'm telling you. Mom... I need three things. - His number... - His? Yes. Ten minutes with the mayor. And a very good lawyer. Alright. 730,260 ZLOTYS COLLECTED FOR ABANDONED CHILDREN Dad! Hi! Oh, jeeze! Hey, my monkeys! Mom can't make dumplings! - The soup's terrible! - Listen... it was never your fault I left. You understand? Never. - I love you. - We love you. - Very much. - Look under the tree. Aha... Hi. Hi. I admit I'm hopeless. I can't cope without you. I love you too. - Hello. - Hello. These are papers for seeking custody. Fill them out now, I'll file them after Christmas. And this is a power of attorney for me. Who are you? Michalina Jantar, but call me Angel. From Santa. - What you wanted. - I'm waiting for mom. You're always bored here. You have no one to play with. There, you'll have boys your age. You can paint together. What do you say? Ho, ho, ho! Hello! Merry Christmas! Hi! One, two, three, four... six, seven, eight, nine, ten... The kids are staying put. Nothing will change? Almost... - How'd you do it? - Long story... Eleven, twelve... thirteen. Thirteen Santas! This's it, Ms. Director. No, just the beginning. Come to daddy. Yep... The sun... is bright and warm... The green things are leaves... Soon everything will turn green. You'll see. You don't want to go in? Let's go? Let's go.
