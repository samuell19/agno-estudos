Hey guys! - Hello. - How are you doing? Fine. So you took possession of the vehicle? You got used to it? - It's a nice piece of machinery. - Yes. Don't worry, this car will take you wherever you want to go. Oh! I brought you... a little bonus. - Who should I give it to? - It's all the same. Thank you. Tomorrow, at this hour, you will be very far away. It's all very well but... Yes, you have to go. Thanks again. A new ice age Working hard? Show some spirit, kid! - Let the boys do this. - I wish I could. Come on, poppet! Here is yours. Do you think this season has been hard? No, not really. What are you going to do now? Go back to Cherbourg? Or stay here? The usual. You're going back to Cherbourg? Am I interrupting? Never. How nice! What are you going to do now? Enough with your chair. I told you already - It's fine. - No, it's not. - You're taking care of some kids later? - Yeah, a summer camp. I'll go. - Is the chocolate good? - Yeah! - Can I take it with me? - No, leave some for us. I'm kidding. - Anyway, look at your t-shirt! - What? You mean you like it. - You want it? I'll give it to you. - No, I'm fine. I'm going now. Bye! Ciao. Someone lent me a board. Let's try it together. No, look at the weather. Well, it's sunny. Yes... But... Is the jackass coming with us? Are you talking about Chopion? Show some respect for my friends! So what? Leave me alone. Seriously, don't you feel like leaving? Are you crazy? You could go to the mountain. There are plenty of jobs there. You just did one year of college and you came back. Travel! Just let me be please. I can't leave anyway. Why? Because... I'm mountain sick, okay? Mountain sick? How can you know? Our parents never took us to the mountain. I just know it, that's all. I can hardly breathe. I... I suffocate and I... I don't know, some sort of hallucinations. Hallucinations? Yeah. But... Sometimes I can barely walk. I stagger. - Like I was drunk on the mountain. - Drunk in the mountain? Here. Thanks. Did you visit Mom? No, I made them myself. I'm not going to Cherbourg anymore anyway, that city is too lame. Who was that guy over there? What guy? That guy, near you. I haven't seen any guy. Do you know what Stan told me? No. He told me his ex-girlfriend had a tiny life line. - A life line? You mean on her hand? - Yeah. So? Is she still alive? I don't know. How should I know? Well this is fascinating. Let me see yours. Your life line is tiny. It's weird. Well, I have to go. - So soon? - Yeah. I... I have things to do. Well bye then. Ciao. Hi Lucas! How are you doing? Shall we go for a walk later? - Will you come later? In an hour. - Yeah, sure! See you later. Come on Mimi! Forward! Come on! - Shall we go? - Let's go. Let's go. Come on Mimi! I'll teach you... What? - Hi Eric, how are you doing? - Hi. - Did you change your mind? - About what? - Do you still want to leave? - Yes. - You're sure? - Yes! - I would understand if... - I still want to leave. Yeah? Come on then. About... the papers. I brought you... the car registration and all the papers about the car. I brought you the cards too. So, I'm giving them all to you. And... You'll see, on this map I draw... the best path you can take. It's just an option. There will be no problem if you take another one. Live your own life. There will be no problem with another path. The only thing that matters is that the car arrives safely. And... Oh, yes! I forgot something I always bring with me. My divination book. It's a book I really like. Would you accept to... Choose a page randomly. It's be fun for you to read it before you go. Just like that. Don't worry, it doesn't bite. The sky is getting darker. The curlew is calling him in the moist and brown dunes. The traveler hurries to get to the city. It is high tide. It is low tide. The darkness is crawling on roofs and walls. But the sea is calling from the darkness. With their soft white hands, the waves are erasing the footsteps from the sand. It is high tide. It is low tide. The light will come back, but the traveler will never see the shore again. Just write "Big breakfast". I don't know what they did last night but... Do you know this is my day? Yeah, yeah. We will have to party then. - Cheers. - Cheers. So? You look like you're starting an elephantiasis. A what? Elephantiasis. It's... a deforming disease. It's located on the teguments. What's that? It's the first layer of the epidermis. And... It grows on the legs and the arms. But sometimes it's on your face and you kind of inflate. Like them. Have you seen Eric? No, I haven't seen him today. Are you alright? Eric? By the way, what are you plans for this afternoon? Weren't we supposed to fix the huts? Oh, right. You know, I'm not sure they will make it through winter. - Do you want me to feed them? - Yes, they are coming. So you hear voices actually. - Yes. - Thank you! Good day, Lady! He... He.... Hello, yo... you... I didn't understand what she said. I've been living here with my kid for almost a year now. We have a nice house, but it's hard to warm up in winter. We have to think thoroughly before moving to the countryside. It's very different from the city. - But do you enjoy being here? - Yes I do. It feels good. And the kid likes it too. Your brother seems to enjoy playing with the kid. Yeah, it seems so. What's gotten into you? You've been acting weird recently. Did you go to Cherbourg yesterday? Did you mix? Yes. Yes, it all went well. We had a minor issue with a cable, but... - We had replacement cables so we fixed it. - Good. Excuse me. Yes, hello? Yes. Yeah. Yes, it's possible. What are you doing? - You're going home? - Yes. Don't be too long. We have many things to do. What? I'm going to look for them. See you later. Oh, you're here! Can you leave the room for five minutes so I can get ready, please? Well, I don't know. Of course you do! Please, be nice. You're in a hurry? Thanks, David. David, are you here? David? Yes? Don't you think Eric has been acting weird recently? Don't you? David, do you hear me? What a pain!

Seriously, Where's Eric by the way? - I don't know. Anybody saw him? - No - Where is he? - Maybe with Béa. With Béa? - What would he do with Béa? - Eric. - What did he said? - What would he do with Béa? - No, I just said... - Let's go find him! - Eric! - Come back! - Have you already thought of the Apocalypse? - What?

You cleaned it up all by yourself? Yes. Eric didn't help you? No. I haven't seen him yet. He's with Iron Chin I think. Thank you. - What are you doing here? - Is Eric here? No. Have you seen him? No, I haven't seen your brother. - Are you holding the reins? - What? Oh, yes. Great! Hey, look over there! Have you tried to call Chopion? Yes. Yes? I talked to his mother on the phone. She hasn't seen him in the past three days. Just like us. What the hell are the two of them doing? What about Maud? His ex. Maud is an idiot. She doesn't understand a thing. Really nothing. She's not worth calling. Are you sure he didn't go swimming the other day? Mom! Mom! Mom! - Hello Annick. - Hello. - How are you doing? - Fine. Still nothing? - Is David here? - Yes, over there, in the hut. David! - How are you doing? - Fine. - Let's go for a small walk. - Okay. David, look at this dune. It's collapsing. It's a pity. I went to the police, you know. They told me they couldn't do anything. Because, when an adult disappears, one must wait for two months. We have to wait a few more days. We have to wait, again. I remember... Your brother, when he was young, he used to pretend he was going to jump out of the car. And on day... I never knew if he really meant to do it. He fell on the pavement. Your father didn't want to stop. For a moment, I was... petrified on my seat. I wasn't able to move. Or breath. The car was running. In the rear-view mirror I saw him get back on his feet. I saw his little silhouette. His light clothes. The car was still running. And he was becoming smaller and smaller. In the end he was just a dot. What a fright! Well! I have to go. By the way, can you handle the accounting? Do you want me to help you? - No, I can do it alone. - Really? Yes. I'll be going. I saw Stan earlier and... He told me Chopion was dead. Did Stan say something else? He told me Chopion died in a car crash. He dies abroad and his body was repatriated a few days ago. That's all he said? Yeah... He knows nothing more. Béa? Béa! Open up! It's David! I don't know where he is. I know nothing more than you. Chiroki Dol. Never heard of it. Chiroki Dol? Do you have internet here? Yeah. Can we check this? Thank you. "Thank you"? Is it better with the sandals? You're French? You really have to put band-aids on when you go out and remove them at night. So the wounds have fresh air but can also cicatrize. Is there any other French here? Well, yes, sometimes. I mean, this city is a real hub so... There a people from everywhere. And... Where are they? There is nobody at the moment. Why do they come here? Just like everybody. Why are you here? A French guy called Eric. Does it ring a bell? Not at all. And another one named Chopion? He probably died in a car crash. You really don't remember them? There are car crashes everyday. This is all I could find. But it should do to trick? Thank you. You really have to disinfect it. How did you end up here? You were bringing a car? Yeah. Do many French persons bring cars here? Well, yes. And what do they do after that? It depends. Either they go home or they go to Burgas. Have you ever heard of it? No. You can go there if you want to go somewhere else. Where to? I don't know, wherever you want. Have you made them tight enough? Try to walk. See if you feel comfortable with them. Is it better? Yes, a bit. Thanks. So you stayed here? Well yes. I had traveled a lot, so... I found a way to stay here. I like it here. Where do you come from? A very small island at the South of Aegean Sea. A very small island. Very high. Yes, very high and... And very arid? Well it's like a rock. It's very windy. There is a small village. Only one village, near the quay. Apart from that, there is nothing much. Of course, there are tourists in the summer. But as I told you the island is very high so it's hard to walk there. And it's kind of weird because... Every summer you always see three or four of them... petrified, still, with vertigo, unable to move. They are here, clinging to the grass... This sounds like a weird island. You don't believe me? I do. It was not that bad. I had friends there. But... But that island was hurting my feet. They sent me to a doctor and he told me it was... Disadaptation syndrome? You know about it? I... It's a weakness in the adaptation process. You're often... very tired. Your larynx is irritated. And... there is also a hypersensitivity in the sole of the feet. It can be very painful. This is what I had, yes. This is not what I have. It's just that I walked... several days with shitty sneakers. Hello! Thanks. - Thanks. - Thanks! This is my brother! This is my brother! Do you know him? This is Eric, my brother! Do you speak French? Look, this is my brother! Did you take this picture? Do you know him? Are you here? A beer? As you wish. We're drinking some shots because it's Milos' birthday. You're not used to this, are you? Was it this kind of party, the night the picture was taken? Wait. He wants to talk to you. What does he want? To know what you know about the other one, with a dog's face. I know nothing. He says he knows nothing. Nothing? He has to know something. He was here, he's on the picture. Are you sure it is your brother? How can you know, since he has no face? I just know it. Stop acting innocent. You perfectly remember that idiot of a French. He caused a lot of troubles in the village. Is he dead, the guy with a dog's face? Who knows where, in the hills, the wild boars are eating his bones? What did he say? That he probably went to Burgas to look for a car. He doesn't really remember, they were all drunk that night. You should go there. You will probably find something new there. If we are lucky, maybe we can find one of his legs. Tell him! - Were you here, the night of the picture? - No, no. I was in the mountains. I wanted to visit a monastery. There is a car on the road. Down there. In a ravine. Nobody told you about it? No. Not that I remember. There are cars everywhere here. Alex talked to Mitko. You know, the driver. He drives to Burgas everyday. He can take you there if you want. Want to come with me at Milos'? It's nearby. Don't you want to come with me? Stop, Mitko! Stop, Mitko! Will you help me? When we got to Burgas. Why do you let him go there? I saw him one night. He was crawling on the road. I almost ran him over. He was greatly wounded, on the hips and the face. What's the plan? Why did we stop here? He's not going to Burgas anymore. Mitko's not going to Burgas anymore? Fuck! What is this shit again? Are you telling me lies? So what do we do now? You have nothing to say? You know, the guy with a dog's face was in that crashed car. "The guy with a dog's face"? You mean my brother? Is he dead? I don't know. Mitko told me... The night of this accident he almost ran a guy over. He was crawling in the middle of the road. He took him in his truck. He thinks it was a Frenchman. And... Also... He was losing a lot of blood. He wanted to stay here. - Where? - I think he took him here. I'm not sure. I think it was around here. What happened next? I don't know. They were all at the bar, totally drunk. There was the guy with the dog's face and there was another Frenchman with him. I think they got into a fight with Alex. Then they left, insulting him and pointing fingers. It made Peter very angry. He took his car and went after them. They were all driving like madmen. The first car went into the ravine and the second one rolled over. Peter died instantly. The two Frenchmen... One died instantly, I think. We never found the other one. People in the village say an animal must have eaten him. Eaten by an animal? Yes. Like a wild boar. I don't know. Excuse me, do you know where the Frenchman hurt in a car crash is? No, I don't know. What did you say? Nothing. What is it? What's wrong? Why are you looking for the Frenchman? He is his brother. Do you have eggs today? Forget about the eggs. They are looking for the Frenchman. This is his brother. Where is he? Who are you talking about? The Frenchman. We want to know if he is dead or alive. He left. Where to? I don't know. When did he leave? He left. He is not here anymore. This is the only thing you need to know. - Leaving already? - Yes. - And the eggs? Tomorrow? - Yes, tomorrow. Where are you? Hello. "Truck"? How do you say "how are you doing"? Do... There is nothing to see here. Where do you come from? Why do you ask? You remind me of Marie-Hélène Drass. That girl I met once. I'm Claire. Claire. As in "clairvoyant". I think my tea was pretty delicious. Now it's time for you to leave. Subtitles: tadanobu@KG Proofreading: flipflink
