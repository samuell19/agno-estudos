Hey Sara, is your mother around? What do you mean who am I? Don't you really recognize me? It's not funny! Don't laugh. Can I talk to your mother? Are you alone? Do you like being alone? Yes that's true. We haven't been going out much lately. But that doesn't mean I don't think of you. "WHAT MAX SAID" Sara, you seriously didn't recognize me? It was a joke? Well, if your mother is not around, nothing. Don't tell her I called. I'll call again. Goodbye. Kisses. Doctor Tarras? I'm a patient. M?ximo Gasc?n. Yes, please. It won't take long, just a minute. Doctor Tarras? I don't know if you remember some days ago you put me a tooth cap. And... it's moving. I'm sorry. Didn't know it was that late. Alright, at the clinic. I'm sorry for waking you up. Goodbye. Thank you very much. Federico? It's Max. Were you having dinner? Well, don't worry. It's not urgent. No, I just wanted to end the other day discussion. Because... I think you cut the conversation in a very frivolous way. Yes. You said I was a fanatic intellectual.. From the 17th century searching for the absolute truth. Well... I'm not trying to sermonize you. I just wanted to end the discussion. Okay, go eat your dinner. Bye. Hello? I'm Max. Excuse me, I thought you were Cristina. I got the wrong number. Sorry. Ferm?n? I'm Max. Hey, don't you remember Cristina's number by any chance? What do you mean Cristina who? Well, some years went by but... you know Cristina. Yes, of course, that Cristina! All of a sudden I thought I could remember her number. Yes that's right. It's possible that she doesn't live there anymore. But, I don't know. Nothing in particular. I just... wanted to know how she was. Well, I'll find her anyways. Thanks a lot Ferm?n. Bye. Can you put Father Urlieta on the phone please? Thank you. Father Urlieta? I'm an old student from high school. My name is M?ximo Gasc?n. They called me Max. Yes... I think you should remember. You taught me religion for 4 years! Of course it was a lot time ago... 30... More than 30 years ago I think. If I'd tell you some details you surely remember me. We'd spend the entire day talking and arguing. About everything. Theology and ethics... Everything. And suddenly I'm remembering all those conversations. And I'd like to clarify some misunderstandings that happened back in the days. Father Urlieta, are you there? No, It's not about any religious doubt. In fact, what I'd like to talk with you is about those conversations. You were very efficient and convincing when arguing. It was some kind of dialectics full of sophisms. An authentic brainwashing. I'm not trying to offend you. In fact, my intentions are pure. Absolutely pure. I just wanted to see you and talk with you. I'm sorry but I'd like to see you. Yes, yes. Any other day. I'll call you. Well, thank you Father Urlieta. Bye. Man! You look good with that beard! What have you done? You'd be surprised by the enormous amount of sounds around us. And we don't listen to them at all. Do you use that for your compositions? We'll see... I'm not sure. You could compose some kind of horror symphony with those noises. People are so used to them it would be difficult to scare them. I bet silence would scare them more. It'd leave them with their own noises. Exactly. Like what happened to me. What about the play? Good. After this long time there's nothing much to do but asking questions. And Clara? Did you have any children? One daughter. We're separated. But you were the perfect couple! Well, at least to me! You're exaggerating. - It was a crazy love! I'm telling you! Even once, the cops stopped you in the middle of the street! Because we were making out. At that time kissing in the street at daylight... You tell me. It was only because we were young. You still are. Not long ago I read your article in a magazine. I can't remember which one. You basically said the real protest emerges spontaneously, apart from the political parties. It wasn't exactly like that. Something like that. As you know, I don't care about politics at all. I can't do nothing about it. It must be because of my pessimism. But every time I think about those issues, I get useless conclusions. I'm such a mess... On the other hand, I'm sure you chose right. You're fine. That's what the doctor says. But it's not true. You know I've always envied your job? The music? To me it's like magic. Of course I have a terrible hearing. There's nothing to envy about. It's just a hobby, not a job. The composer who doesn't perform is nothing but an amateur. I thought you were fine in Germany. Yes... Well that was before the sanitarium. What sanitarium? Didn't you know? Everybody knows it! I spent two years in a madhouse. I didn't know at all. Yes. But what happened to you? I had a screw loose I guess. But know you feel better? Besides, you know, the crazy ones are the most intelligent. It's a shame that no one else thinks that way. You shouldn't care. Of course I care, unfortunately. Well, I'm fine now. I have a couple of projects. Even though I only need an orchestra. But apart from that I'm practicing some songs. Hey, I'd like you to hear them. Why don't you come by any time? My opinion could unsettle you. You could tell me something about the lyrics. Be sure I will. So you're not that bad? I'm always complaining. It's the very first thing that psychiatrists teach you. To complain about everything. Since the moment they tell you you're dominated by the subconscious you start playing the victim of everything. If I knew, I'd have visited you. But I was really taken care of in the sanitarium. Besides, Laura was so kind to me. She worked, took care of all the expenses... She visited me frequently. The only bad situation... Took place when I went back home. I can't blame Laura. She's much younger than me. And two years is too much time. The thing is when I was back, she had a lover. I didn't say a thing to her when she told me. She told me she was incapable of leaving her lover. And I accepted. I would've accepted anything from her. I felt so grateful. I felt an infinite debt to her. Moreover, I was so used to see Laura as the head of the family... that for a little time I was the one cleaning the house. I can assure you I did it better than her. The truth is I couldn't do anything else. I couldn't go out. The mere fact of deciding to do anything was below the threshold. I was afraid of people walking in the streets. The more movement I saw around me, the more I wanted to be still. I'm sure things weren't as bad as I remember them now. Are you coming to the rehearsal? -Well... One of the songs is going to amaze you. Then I'll go for sure. Even now I can't understand everything that happened back then. I felt such panic I wanted to go back to the madhouse. Stop thinking about it. The funniest thing was when Laura left that guy... She almost reproached me for my apathy. Are you writing in your diary? How do you know I have a diary? You told me. I'm sure I didn't tell you anything. But are you writing it? Yes. And what is it about? About what happens to me. Some stuff. You're not very talkative today. I'm upset. With me? With mom. Don't tell her about the diary. I won't. You always end up telling her everything. - I won't say a word. She'd start asking... and as I won't say anything she'd look for it everywhere. Did you hide it? Don't think I'm gonna tell you where it is. But you can tell me some of the stuff you write about. What for? You wouldn't understand. Why wouldn't I? Because you live different. That's true. But I've also lived like you. I also wrote in my diary. Do you still have it? I've lost it. But do you remember the things you wrote? Some of them. Tell me. See how one can't tell a thing about that? It must've been too boring. Why? I remember how I wrote the things that happened to me. For example: "I woke up at 8. It was cold." The bed was warm. "I was almost late... because Jacoba took too long to make breakfast." Things like that. I've dreamt about dogs. -With dogs? Yes. That happened very often. I saw a square full of dogs. They moved, sniffed around... There wasn't any people. Only dogs! And sometimes, me. Don't you remember about going to the beach? Arrizaga, Alonso, Adbinu, Arza... I still know it! No, please, don't name the whole list. -Arostegui... Arostegui comes before Arza! You're right. I'm sure I couldn't recognize any of them. Arostegui, Arza, De Blas... I remember a lot of soccer team lineups. The Italian one was beautiful. Lupo, Taviani, Becattini,.. Est?banez, Estremianas... Who were the next to Estremianas? Alc?n! Maybe I know the class list better! What time is it? It's 12:15. -I haven't called Laura yet. Be right back. Julian and I were close friends. When you're young, you meet friends everyday and then they vanish. Don't you get bored with our silliness? -No. How long didn't you guys see each other? We met by coincidence the other day. Apart from that... Maybe 10 years or more... You also named that list back then? I hope not. The last thing I remember is we were really drunk. At dawn we decided to look for an old mutual girlfriend. What a catastrophe... Didn't you find her? Yes. Amelia. The husband tried to throw us down the stairs! She was completely fat! They say us singers end up fat. I'm sure you won't. Laura says hi. How is she? -Fine. She's still my guardian angel. Always worried about me. She asked me how were you doing. And what was your answer? That you look so great! And what do you think? I think you have a normal look. A moment ago, I was thinking how would you look without beard. Taxi! Luisa! Make him come to the concert! Hey Max, if you don't come, let's not wait another 10 years huh? Do you like singing, right? Yes. It's what I like the most. And do you like that song you sang before? I know that poem is yours. It'd be better to say it was. I wrote it more than 20 years ago. How were you like back then? Without beard. Why don't you ask me to come to your place? I'm asking myself the same. I can assure you I'm not calling for nothing. Then put me with the asylum's principal. Alright, with the housemother then. Good evening. I was trying to explain to the other Mrs. the matter of my call. But apparently, there's a strong discipline in not letting an adult lady, who's there by her own will, answer the phone. I'm not trying to teach you anything. But... I don't see the necessity in imposing... military rules to some peaceful old people. The problem is this: It turns out that Jacoba... left home leaving a note in which she wrote me where she was going. Without any apparent reason. Please note that I'm disconcerted. Jacoba's been at home for more than 40 years. I don't know. I can't remember her last name. Good morning. Did you make all this by yourself? Of course. And where did you get the jam and the toasts? Everything was in the house. And the cups? They're yours. Where were they? There. They'd only be used for special occasions. Like today, for example. God, they're tasty. Don't laugh. One breakfast like this could end all the day worries. What an easy remedy. As simple as making it everyday. You'll have to come and make it. I'll do it for a reasonable price. Where will you say you stayed the night? What is the matter? Will you lie? Nobody will ask me. Where did you meet mom? At college. And had you met other girls before? Yes. Specially one. What was her name? Why do you care? Come on, tell me. If you tell me about your writings. That's blackmail. Then I'm not telling you her name. Her name was Amelia. Was she pretty? No. But she told me that she liked me, and that she was feeling good with me. Are you and mom still arguing? Much less now. Poor Clara... Why do you say "poor Clara"? -It's just a manner of speaking. She says the same about you. Is that right? You're sad. Clara is right. Mum's used to speak badly of you. But I always defend you. Don't do it. It's useless. -But it upsets me. If I'd say bad things about mom, would you defend her as well? I've never heard you dissing her. Well I can do it. Mom is so selfish. She just wants everybody saying good things to her. Everybody like that. Yeah, but maybe there's someone thinking different. Clara demands everything and she's right. Mom says you're a looser. To whom? I heard. She said that so you'd listen to it. -No. But I'm sure she knew I was listening. With whom were she talking to? Could you guess? I met a woman once... -Aren't you interested in what mom said anymore? Once, I met a woman who told me to write down 7 numbers. -And she told you each number slowly without failing. And all the numbers were odds. Well then, with whom were she talking to? To Juan. Juan? Clara is dating Juan? You're never aware of anything. Do they go out frequently? Juan says he wants to live with Clara. She's crazy. He also says you're still in love with mom. And that you'll always be. I don't understand why all men are after her. It was always like that. Are you in love with mom? Me? No. Love vanishes. And it never comes back. When we decided to split up, my wife assumed that I was leaving and she was keeping the house. That's what happens usually. I think it's not fair. But surprisingly I accepted that as something natural. Someone had to leave. We could've flipped a coin, for example. And where did you go? To a hotel. Even now I still ask myself what I was doing in that room all alone.. Awake and looking at the ceiling. But wasn't there another woman? -Yes, Rosa. It took some days until I told her I've left Clara. Why? I don't know why I didn't go to my parents house in the very beginning either. And you had a woman.. And a house waiting for you? And you went to a hotel? I was there for a few days without unpacking the bags. Then I reacted and I called Jacoba to tell her I was coming over. By the way she was really upset with me. And Rosa? I couldn't go to Rosa's place because her husband was there. You didn't tell me that. Truth is I felt offended by the failure of my marriage. That's why I stayed at the hotel. So absurd. -Quite absurd, yes. Do you have any children? One daughter. Sara. She kept her too. I think that's great. You tell me why? We had terrible conflicts about Sara. I started showing myself weak and falling back.. And all of a sudden I had to ask for permission to see my daughter. (Praying) Follow me. She's much better now. Jacoba! Don't bother her. Jacoba. Who's there? -I'm M?ximo. M?ximo? Did you come here from school? I don't know what to tell you. I don't know if your parents are at home or if they've left. Have you eaten already? Jacoba, how are you feeling? Bad. Last night was terrible. You look good. That's impossible at my age. Even more now... that I'm dying. Don't say that. I'm dying! Come on Jacoba, you have to be strong! I don't want to! I'm dying... It's all because of your son. It's a girl. Don't you remember? Why do you blame her? He's a selfish person. When he was small, he was so quiet. Probably he was thinking what he was going to do later. He was really cute. And very obedient. You know already what happened when he grew up. He turned out to be so ugly! Now that we're married I can tell you... He took away my house. You said the house was for me. But he came back and took it away. So I told him I was leaving to die in other place. Don't listen to her. She doesn't know what she's saying. I know what I'm saying! Who's that? She's a nun. She takes care of you. You're younger. And you have a son... But I'm your wife forever. So, when you die.. The house is for me. If not, why would I last this long. It's better to leave her rest. -I'm not tired! Why did you leave the house and came here? Do you want me to take you home? -What are you saying? That would kill her! M?ximo can't be good to me! Yes.. Take me to my house! When you recover, you'll can come back. Now, you have to be strong. -I don't want to be strong. And you better realize this: I don't have anything to thank you or your parents for. It's better to leave her rest. I was leaving... -She can't be moved from here! I suppose... -She's perfectly fine! - M?ximo! Come closer to the window. Have a look. They say breads are falling again. Watch out! Working conflicts. Pensioner's home. Yes, put it through. Hello? Yes I'm fine. Normal. Hear about what? Of course I've read the newspapers. Yes, I'll wait. Luisa. I prefer to meet Laura by myself. As you want. Yes. Yesterday. Almost at eight. Sometimes I heard him saying at dusk time. When I walked in the terrace door was opened. When I saw it, I knew what happened. Soon people screamed. Windows opened. Everybody showed up. They said someone fell out. As I was going up in the elevator he was falling down. Did he try it before? Never. I was scared of him doing it before. But he was fine now. You know they had to confine him. He told me the day we met. He was very good now. But I have an idea that comes to my mind. Julian wanted to win. To win? Why don't we leave? I'm afraid of people coming here. As you want. In the worst moments, Julian used to draw his silhouette with his finger. He'd repeat it... over and over. I didn't know what to say. When you met.. What did Julian say? We talked a bit about everything. He told me what happened to him. And about me? That you were nice to him. Nothing else? Also, what happened between you two. He didn't look very affected that day. It's true. Shall we leave? Do I look good? Very good. The day he met you, he came home radiant. The only important thing to him was that you wouldn't realize how happy he was for seeing you. Do you know why he chose my poem to compose? I thought he could've wrote it. Specially the last verses. "And with hands trembling..." How was it? "With hands trembling by tenderness". He said you wrote it thinking of Clara. Who knows. I'm sure. How is she? I guess she's fine. You and Clara broke up on time. I was determined to leave Julian when he'd go out of the sanitarium. I hoped to find him recovered and so I'd explain to him everything. But when he came back... I won't say he was worse. It's not that. But he was a total helpless person. I don't know what would he told you. He told me the same. I couldn't leave him in that spot. It was a terribly unfair situation for me. I thought that with me by his side I could help him. How is Luisa? Who told you about Luisa? I heard from mom. Well, from Berta. She was talking to her. What a lousy, filthy bad omen bird she is! What's omen? It's a sign, a premonition... I sense your eyes like dark violets... Who wrote that? Mine. -It's beautiful. And why wouldn't it be? Are you gonna write more poetry? I don't know. What did Berta say about Luisa? That she's a whore, more or less. But why do you care? And what did your mother say? Nothing. She said she knew you were dating some girl already, but she didn't know her. And Berta said she was very tall and young. Nothing else? Well.. she couldn't care less about who were you dating. That she only cared about when you're with me. And that she weren't calm we I'd leave. What does Clara mean by that? I want to meet Luisa. Do you want to know how is she? -Yes. Luisa sings. Does she play the guitar? I don't think so. Why not if she sings? She doesn't sings modern songs. She sings opera? -Yes. She's studying. She haven't performed yet. Then Berta was right. She's much younger than you. She is exactly 23 years old. Much younger than mom. And even younger than Berta! He's 18. He's studying economics. He's 5 years older than you? And what do you talk about? Dunno. About everything. What do you talk with Luisa? About everything too. But it's not the same. Why not? -Because it's not. What's his name? -Daniel. Daniel is in college, and he faces issues completely different than yours. What do you mean? Strikes and all that? -For example. Well we're gonna make one. I don't know if not going to school is considered as a strike. I'm not sure about that at all! You're so reactionary. I'm worried about you dating an 18 years old boy. And what if he were 20? I'd be more worried. Don't laugh about it. It's not funny at all. It's not that. The other day, a guy who's 20 asked me to go to skate with him. Then tell him to go to skate with his mom. Hey, that would be if I wouldn't wanted to go, huh? Don't talk to me like that! Can I know why are you upset? -I'm not, I'm just worried. You sound just like mom. "Don't talk to me like that!" Is there any of your friends talking to their fathers about this stuff? Not that I know of. And is there anyone brave enough to tell them the same? Neither. And what about that priest you guys are meeting. You talk like that? Like you and me? We don't talk to the priest. Just between us. Sometimes he says something. But that's it. But I'm not the priest. No. You're my father. I come here once a month and you always end up interrogating me. Sometimes I'd like to slap you face! No. Better hit me with your belt! Like Elena's father. And who's Elena's father? A beast, who else. Well, let's calm down. I'm calm. I assume I was bad at you. But you were too. Me? Why? You never give up! You're mad because I'm going out with Daniel. If he were 15 you'd be so happy. 15 is a much more similar age for you. That kid who came to eat with us one day was 15. He seemed nice. Normal. Do you think we talk in the same way with an adult? Then when there's someone older you guys lie? And you lie to me? Tell me. You lie to me. -I didn't say a thing. What you can be sure is I'm not telling you the whole truth. Tell me about Daniel. -Daniel? Yes. Don't think I've forgot. I told you he's 18 and he's studying economics. I know that already. What else? Don't think I know much more. Then when you meet... He says: "I'm 18 and I'm studying economics." He doesn't have that voice! And you answer him: "That's nice! I like you." You're so foolish. You guys must talk about something. -Yes. A lot of things, sure. Can't you tell me anything? I wouldn't know how to repeat them. Right. I'm your father and we can't talk in the same way. No. We can talk the same but no. It's not the same. It's different. I can't figure this out... What? Nothing. Doesn't matter. See? You keep to yourself some things too. But it's not the same. -Why not? You're 13... Daniel is 18... I'm your father... And I want to know what you're doing with an 18 years old boy! Well I go out with him, to the movies, we dance, laugh, argue, tell jokes, we go to the theater.. And nothing else! Had he kissed you? I said nothing else. Won't you have slept with him! That's why you're worried. The whole point was this. It's not funny. What if I'd answer yes. Nothing. What could I do? Who knows.. The first thing would be telling mom. Do you think I should tell her? You should know. So you've slept with him. If you say so... Want to make me angry? That's what you said when I was little. And what are you now? If I were so little you wouldn't ask me this. It's true, but now... -Now everything changed right? You're 13 now, and what you could do is serious. Like riding on Daniel's bike and crash into a truck. That doesn't matter to you. Of course it matters to me. No. Only if I've slept with Daniel. That is my concern me too. -No, just that! If you get so upset, maybe you did something! You always said I should do what seems right to me. And I'll always tell you that! -Then that's it. So you've slept with him? Don't be like that. -How do you want me to be? If you'd tell me the truth, you'd feel more calm. You'd feel more calm, but you won't! Why don't you stay the night here? I told you I couldn't. -I didn't get that impression. What then? What's the matter? Truth is nobody could find you for six days. Alright? You can do whatever you want. Of course. That's what I'm saying. But not what you're thinking. Do you know my thoughts better than me? I see you're going to sermonize me about what I've done, or what you or we've done. I've never asked you to change your behavior. Regardless of what I could think. -No. In the end you're living at Pablo's home. -In my house. I don't care who's the owner. If you'd analyze your behavior with me or Pablo, you'd realize the deep reason... -Don't start with your theories! You live completely apart from them. You've made up a character and your buying it. How is that character to you? -A victim of the society. An idealist, full of altruism. And actually you're selfish, dominant, maniac... And sometimes miserable like everyone else! I think you haven't missed anything. Of course I have! Or do you think it's easy to put up with someone teaching everyone? Is it better for you to act irrationally? A bit of that irrationalism could be good for you. I don't want to keep arguing about this! It'll be better if we don't see each other for a couple of days. I've been wanting to tell you that for a while. It'll be better if we don't meet ever again. I see you've thought about it. Yes. Then I agree. I'm sorry to tell you this while arguing. It's absurd to argue at this point. There's something true in what you say. Can I ask you something? Sure. It's something I'm always thinking. Why did you came here the first night? Because I liked you. Do you think I'm still attractive for women? To me, yes. Of course you are. You knew who I was. I've heard about you. Great piece for your collection. I don't know if you're mean or just pathetic! That night, the only thing that had your interest was the name. Be honest. But what does the first night matter? There have been other nights I think. I just wanted to be sure. Are you calm now? Yes. Then I'm leaving. Nobody stops here. I have an idea. Maybe if I wait here alone somebody stops. Why don't you hide behind there? -I won't. It's easier for a lonely girl. Don't be ridiculous! You're not going to stay here alone. -But you're gonna be right there! No way. Please, let me do it. Don't think that I like picking up people in the road. Did you have breakdown? No. We don't have a car. We're spending the weekend in the countryside. One must be careful. I check everyone who get into my car. But with you there's no doubt. Married? -Yes. Is your wife waiting there? No. Well... We're going to my friend's place. That's good. It has a great ambience. It's separated. In the middle of the field. I congratulate you. You're a lucky man. And why isn't your wife coming? Actually, we've been living separated for a long time. Now that's a coincidence. Give me five! I'm separated too. Watch out! Don't be afraid. I know these roads by heart. How long has it been from your separation? I'm free since 3 years ago. Excuse me for talking like this but to me it was like freedom. My wife thought I'd discuss who keeps the children. I told her she could keep them forever. I've never seen any of them since then. Good God! What an ease, what a beautiful life! There was a moment... in which I thought of killing her. Yes, you heard me. Of course you won't believe it as you're seeing me here talking nicely. I can assure you at that time I'd see those news in which.. A man kills his wife while she sleeps, you know... And I could understand them completely. I surely would've killed her. We got along pretty well... Well I congratulate you because for me it was real hell. Thank God! Thank God I divorced on time. If not, I don't know how could have ended. I'm telling you, I had these terrible thoughts... tremendous! Did you manage everything patiently? More or less. Believe me I'm jealous. She told me that if I was leaving she'd bring charges for abandonment of the home. Do what you want! That she'd get the children custody... It's alright keep them all! Look. In my wrist. Can you see a little sample of what happened the last day? She almost break my arm! She hit me with the iron machine and I thought she broke my arm. Actually, she tried to hit me in the head, so I took the iron machine from her and I hit her! I left her lying on the floor. It was all messed up. We fucked up everything. I remember wondering if she was dead... But not at all! She just got some stitches. Of course I didn't see her. I didn't come back to the house ever again. I haven't seen her or the kids since then. Thing is I don't exactly remember how that fight begun. But that's not important. You've been married and you'll underst... -Careful! Hey! I found a big fridge full of food! I told you! Ram?n keeps the house ready for everything. It's downstairs. Do you want to see it? No. What are we eating? -Are you hungry? No. Do you like the house? -Yeah. Have you seen the soccer goal? What are we going to do? Nothing. Goal! It's your turn now. Now you. I did know that Clara would talk about us. About our relationship. About how was everything. But I didn't expect what she said. Did she talk about me? You weren't the point. -The point was you two. Yeah, us... It'd be better to say I was the subject. Clara wanted to talk about me... And boy she talked... Did she say you were selfish? That's what she always say. If you think she's right.. -She's right about that. I don't know exactly what selfish means. Someone who loves himself more than others. Yeah, but that happens to everyone. Some of them realizes and others don't. Did she just say that? No. She talked more about... I don't know! I remember it was getting dark.. And I started crying. I don't know if Clara noticed that. Did you cry? I've never seen you crying. Clara talked and talked... And she was making an image of me that I couldn't recognize. Has this happened to you before? Yes. No. That couldn't happen to you. Why do you ask me then? Clara said everything was over. That it'd be better if we don't try it again. That everything became an useless effort. And what did you say? I didn't speak much. I started imagining the future. I felt everything fell apart. As Clara was talking... I felt more afraid. Without noticing, I repeated several times: "I won't know how to live alone". One of them got Clara mad. And she said: "You've always lived alone!" That I should be used to it already. That even in those moments I was incapable of saying that I couldn't live without her. That I only thought of myself. You didn't think of me? We'll talk about you later. And what did you two say about me? I remember telling Clara that I wanted to see you more often. We discussed some issues concerning you. And why didn't you ask me? You were too little. How long ago? Two years? More. Three? Would had you preferred to live with me? No. Then we decided right. Yes. Not long ago, a girl wrote a letter to Max. But then she broke it. You tell me why. If you interrupt me I lose the inspiration. The letter said: Dear Max I'm thinking of you. And I'm writing you some things that I can't tell you. Can't you still? Did you realize that it's not the same now? We don't love each other anymore. That's what the letter said? Nothing else? Did it say something about me? Yes. Tell me. Tell me! Can't you say those things about me? You've never wanted to know them. Well now I do. What do they matter now?! To me they do! Tell me! Stop it! You're hurting me! Then tell me! You're nuts!! That's what you think about me? No. That would be so easy! Besides, you'd take that as a compliment! I don't want to say what I think of you because it doesn't matter anymore! Would you like to live in the countryside? Always. I'd stay here. I couldn't get used to it. I'd be afraid. What are you afraid of? I don't know. There's a lot of time to think. Strange ideas come to mind. For example? Some things. When you're alone? -No. Even though you're with me? Even more with you. Then you're afraid of me. You? Not a bit. Maybe indirectly. Those ideas may scare me, not you. I'm glad I don't scare you. What'ss the impression you get about me? -Fear is not one. Will you be upset if I tell you something? I hope not. Sometimes you make me laugh. I find you funny. Yikes. Yes. When you're worried about something. You're funny. You think too much. That's true. Of course it is. You're always analyzing everything. And saying what's good and bad. And why things happen this way and not the other. I think there's no much use in talking about what happened already. Probably... You're always trying to explain people what happens to them. Instead of looking to yourself. Once, I was thinking of you.. And then I got sad. Then I'm not funny always. You never put any effort in a better living. For example, you say you like living in the field. Then why don't you move here? Would you come with me? Why do you say that? I'm saying if you'd live here with me. I don't know. I told you I may not like the idea. What does that mean to what we were talking? Do you love me Sara? And what did that come from? I'm asking you. How I couldn't love you. You're my father! And if I weren't? Imagine for a moment that I weren't. What a nonsense! What do I know? Could you give me a cigarette? I'm going to bed. We had a long ride. Good night. Bye. Good night.
