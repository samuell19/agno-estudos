Wow. Astounding, simply astounding. (Geiger counter clicking) Whoa. Oh my. Oh my gosh! Alistair, you fool. The initial observations are often the most critical. I can't trust them to memory. This is Alistair McDowell of the Space Institute, April 20th at 10:00 hours. After tracking on radar what appeared to be a meteor losing its gravitational orbit I have entered the woods just north of the city following its projected trajectory. The impact site is littered with what appears to be a grass. I will now take a sample. (beeps) Evidence of a substance has been taken off the outer skin of the meteorite. Upon further observation it seems that rather than a high-density rock the meteorite seems to be composed of a metal of some kind. Formed into a crude sphere. Huh. Was this done naturally? Or possibly by some living, sentient beings? More data is needed, but the possibility is exciting. Curious. By the markings on top of this plate it looks as if something had once sat atop it. Maybe, I don't know jostled loose in space or knocked over. - Hiyah! Put 'em up dude. - I am unarmed, I assure you. - Sex, lies, and video tape. I never knew a fed without a strap. You must have an ankle piece. - I told you, I'm unarmed nor am I a fed as you call it. Do you mean federal officer, as in FBI? - FBI, CIA, DKNY. - DKNY? - They're all a part of the same alphabet soup, brother. - But. - Turn around slow, no sudden moves. (intense music) - Larnell! - Al? You look different. You been hitting the creatine? Throwing some weights around? - (chuckling) You noticed. But what the heck are you doing here? - Sorry about that, I thought you might be federal popo. - Well, clearly not. I mean I'm working for the Space Institute. - No kidding? Dude that's great. Good you got here before the feds. - Why is that? - Maybe you and I can work together on this thing. Sweet mother of pearl, I was right. I was tracking this thing from outer space and I figured it came down somewhere right around here. - Wait, you were tracking it, but how? - Let's just say I have access to certain equipment. The less you know, the better, Al. Plausible deniability and all. - Um, why were you worried that I might be a federal officer? - Come on dude, the feds have been covering up UFO sightings since that flying saucer crash back in 1947. They still got the alien dudes locked up in Area 51. They've been feeding the poor little dudes Old Milwaukee and tater tots. - Taters. - Hiding 'em from us because they don't think we can handle the truth. They've been using their brains for technology too. I'm talking about microwave ovens, cell phones, Hot Pockets. - Hot Pockets? - And Jimmy Cameron. - Wait, Jim Cameron, the movie director? - Yeah, he's their offspring. The aliens's I mean. Come on Al, Avatar is like a five- hour love letter to his home planet. But the fed dunes think us dumb yokels can handle it because it's just a story. Well not me, baby. - I don't know about all that but what about all the meteorite? - Don't snow me, Al. I heard you talking to your little tape recorder when I snuck up on you. You know this thing ain't no space rock. It's a spaceship. You and I can expose the secret to the world. Those fed goons will have no choice but to let those poor little aliens out of lock-up. - I don't know anything about that but I've never seen a study of a meteorite like this before. - (sniffing) You smell that? (sniffing) (trippy music) Come on dude, don't tell me you don't recognize it, not after everything we've been through. - Oh my goodness, you're right. It smells like some kind of marijuana. Look at all this stuff. - Don't, don't touch it, we have no idea of its toxicity. - Let me toke some of this shit and I'll take my own fucking reading. - I think the scientific method will be safer. - Safe? Right. We're all livin' on borrowed time anyways, Al. The Armageddon clock is runnin' down, you know. - Armageddon? How exactly have you been occupying your time since I saw you last? It's been, what, a couple years? - Well, homeland security is after me. No biggie, just a little mix-up at the Afghan border. - Jeez, Afghanistan? - It was totally innocent, bro. I was over there with my old buddy Faruk scorin' some high-grade poppy when-- - Okay, okay, maybe you actually shouldn't tell me. I mean after all, plausible-- - Deniability, gotcha. Anyways, I've been living further off the grid. Had to change up my look too, just to be safe. Went over to the Supercuts on Sepulveda and had that crater-face Shauna fix me up with a color and a cut. She done me pretty good, too. Got me lookin' like Zac Efron and shit. Plus, I've been trainin' with a ninja master. Gotta protect myself. - A ninja master? - Well, master might be pushin' it. The dude works in stolen car stereos. But trust me, Wang Dong knows his shit. That's why he's got me dressin' all in black. So I can move with the shadows and strike from the heart of darkness. (exclaiming) The drunken monkey is a terrible thing when unleashed, Al.

And that was after you pounded on my bell here for like five minutes. - Well, it wasn't five minutes and if you heard it, you should've come out sooner. - Heard what? - The bell. - Oh dude, bell's broken. - Anyway, I've got something here that I think you'll find very interesting. (eerie music) - Whoa. Looks like some kind of space bong. - That's exactly right. - [Clerk] No shit. - Hey hey hey hey, not until we discuss price. - Well is it really from space? - Yeah. - Prove it. - Hey. (laughing) Come on man. Just look at it. You ever seen anything like that before? (laughing) - Dude you got some serious fuzz tongue goin' on. Like right in that, there. (grunting) - Yeah, yeah, I gotta go see the doctor about that. - Yeah, you need some medicinal. - Anyway, do you think your shop could use this? Are we gonna do some business? - Yes, I think we are definitely gonna do some business. (laughing) Let me figure out how to open up the cash register. This-- - What are you doing? - I was just helpin' the customer. - Hey, back off slick, we were just doin' business. - Yeah. - Back off? I'm the co-owner of this place. Don't be tellin' me to back off, jack-off. - Hey man. - Hey! I don't want you rippin' us off with some bullshit. Yeah, I heard you from the back. Space bong, my ass. This looks like some bad movie prop. - Yeah, like from 2001 Weed Odyssey. (laughing) - Hey look, I'll make a good deal with you. Maybe you could do something with this, too. Only been used once. (eerie music) - Hey, pud-knocker, this is a head shop, not a pawn shop. - Um, dude, that would look pretty rad in the shop though. - Yeah, well, maybe so but we ain't payin' out the wazoo for it. - No, we're not payin' out the wazoo for it. - 50 bucks. - 50? I'll pay you 20 for it. - It's worth more than that. - Hey, I gotta make a profit too. - 50 bucks, and I'll throw in the jewels and the knife. - I don't want your shit, man. Cash money. What's with the gloves? - Ah. I got burned. - Really? Let's see. - No, no I can't do that. - You want the 20 bucks don't you? Whoa. - Oh, monkey. - Dude, you are totally molding. - [Clerk] That's not good. - Take your shit and get out of here. And don't touch anything, fuck! - Fuck both of you. (muffled rap music) - Hey! Where you goin'? - Dude, you cannot expect me to put new merchandise on the shelf without testing it out first. That would be (chuckling) irresponsible. - Why I ever went into business with you is beyond me. - Oh, because when your career in sports went down the shitter you had to do something, remember? (chuckling) (smack resounding) - Thanks for reminding me. Nobody takes that thing before we find out what it's all about. Hey, you know who might know something about it? - Who? - [Co-Owner] Al. - Who? Al, you know the geek? The one who helped us kill the evil bong and the king bong? - Oh, but technically we didn't kill the evil bong, remember? It was still down there in the jungle when we left. You remember the pootang tribe? (laughing) Talk about the National Geographic. - National Pornographic, you mean, fuck. Put it back on the counter. (groaning) - You're not the boss of me. Look, violence never solved anything, man. (slow jam music) (cell phone beeping) - Hey Al, yeah, it's Brett. Hey, how are you buddy? - Tell me what to do, I'll tell you what to do. Assholes around here. All right, product testing. Here we go. (water bubbling) (electricity crackling) - You are a worm. A parasite. Being this close to you disgusts me. - Now that's uncalled for. - I tolerate it only because I must. You are the first step in my quest for total domination of your world. - You got a nasty 'tude for a bong. You gotta chill out or no one's gonna wanna buy you. Now shut up while I smoke you. (eerie music) Oh now, monkey! (quickly whooshing music) [Bong Voice] Welcome to my world, worm. (eerie music) - Oh snap. Hi there. Dude. You could use some lotion. That's okay, that's okay. You chicks are a little aggressive. That's all right. I'm into it. So, is this like, a three-way situation? I'm into it. It's okay. Oh, that's, that's kinda painful. (groaning) Monkey.

(shrieking) Would you relax man, you're wiggin' me out. - I gotta keep the blood flowing, bro, or else I get stagnant and the palpitations and panic attacks kick in. - [Brett] You're a few skittles short of a full bag. You've gotta stop chasing black helicopters. - Yeah. - What do you make of the bong, Al? - Well, it's most certainly of unknown origin. And the material used to form it is like nothing I've ever seen. I'll know more when I take it back to the lab and run some tests. We were on our way there when you called. - Well as much as I love you, Al, you're not takin' that thing out of my shop until I get my investment back. I paid like twent-, a hundred bucks for that thing. - [Al] The base of this would fit perfectly in that receptacle we found in the meteorite. - Meteorite? - Spaceship, dude. (muffled reggae music) - So you're actually telling us this thing might be from space? - Well, the possibility exists, yes. (eerie vocalizing) - What was that? - Relax there, master of dung poo, it's just Bachman. - Oh, I thought I recognized his voice. Where is brother Bach? Wouldn't mind givin' him some hello nugs. - I think he's in the back bone smuggling one of those fat chicks again. I have no idea where he finds these broads. - I caught him beatin' off to an old-school Star Jones interview once. Brutal. - Bachman! Get out here. - Listen Al, I don't have 60 bucks. Livin' off the grid has its disadvantages, man. - Well, I don't have any money on me either. - Bummer, I was hopin' to score some Taco Bell later. Chalupas make me wet. (playful music) (scoffing) - You putzes. - Hey, Luann. As usual, you are a sunbeam floating on a cloud of happiness. - Did anybody ever tell you that black is O-U-T? - Shadows don't care about style. - (scoffing) Could you be a bigger loser? Is that even possible? - Well I mean, it's, it's obviously Um, it's nice to see you, Luann. It's been some time. - Not long enough. Is this Brett's store? - What, you don't know? - Well, let's just say him and me kind of lost touch. (broken bell clicking) Is he around? - Well, yeah, he just kind of went... - He peaced out for a little bit and we're not really sure when he'll be back. - Yeah. Yeah, and he left us in charge temporarily. - Would you like to purchase a water pipe? It's only slightly used and in near perfect condition. In fact, we'll give you 30 percent off. - What the hell do I need once of those for? - Look, Lu, it matches your eyes. - Get that away from me, you idiot. (sighing) When Brett comes back, tell him to call me. If you think you can remember that. (upbeat music) (door slamming) - I don't think she likes us, dude. - Shit that was close. Hey, thanks for getting rid of her. - Oh hey, she wants you to have that. - Yeah, like that's gonna happen. - I take it your relationship is no longer kosher. - Not unless kosher's a restraining order. - She has a restraining order on you? - Dude, I have a restraining order on her. In case you haven't noticed she's a bit of a handful. When we were down in South America, I lost like four pounds. I didn't realize she's not very supportive. - Really? - Oh, geez, listen to me. Not very supportive? That sounds like some Oprah shit, oh! The thing is, I just keep falling back for it. She's a hot piece of ass but then those true psycho colors come out. Anyway, thanks for having my back, boys. - [Larnell] Where is Bach? - He wasn't back there? - Dude, we heard him. - Well he must've snuck out the back then. So what are you gonna do with that thing anyway? - It's an alien bong bro. - Okay, X-files, alien bong. What the hell do we do? (door latch clicks) - What you do is pray, brothers. - Mr. Rabbit, how are you? - Just Rabbit, brother, just Rabbit. - I can't believe you're still pullin' that priest scam. - Oh, it's no scam. I assure you. You know, I'll never forget my experience with the poontang tribe, nor will I forget the promise I made to a higher power in exchange for saving my life. - Dude, we saved your life. (laughing) - Oh really, did you? Or were your hands guided by... You see, after I was rolled into a doobie and shrunken to microscopic size, I began to see the world as it truly is. A microcosm. We're all just little flakes on the same blue ball. We're all together, and we should behave as such. - Rabbit, have you already been toking today? - I assure you, sir, my vision has never been more clear. - Silly Rabbit, religious institutions are corrupt, man. They've been coverin' up the UFO sightings just like the government. Dude, I have it on good authority that the pope himself has been abducted and probed. - My poor, deluded child. I belong to no institution. I am just me, myself, and I. Traveling the road, spreading the word. - What the hell are you doing here anyway, man? I mean, we're kinda busy with somethin'. - I dropped in to see Bachman. We were gonna have a spiritual powwow. - Oh, a little powwow with the wow wow? A little powwow that you two in the back room when it's all full of smoke? - I have no idea what you're referring to. - Oh yeah, yeah right. You know, how I ever got hooked up with you losers is beyond me. - You had no arm, babe. They drummed you out of the minor leagues. (glass shattering) - How's that for no arm, Curious George? - Ow. - [Brett] Hey, you got a comment too? - No, no, I just--- - Holy shit. That's where that weird guy touched the counter. [Al] Weird guy? - [Brett] The guy I bought the bong from. He had this green shit all over his hands. - It looks a lot like the odd vegetation we discovered at the crash site of the meteorite. - Spaceship. - Yeah, very well, spaceship. Ooh, I can compare it to some of the samples I took at the crash site. Wow. The growth rate is astounding. - Don't touch it. The other dude had this stuff growing all over him. It's some sort of space fungus. (light music) (dramatic music) - This herb is of inferior quality. - I'll have you know that this is some primo... Wait a second, did you just talk? - I see no one else in this room, right boy? - What is it with all you talking bongs? (laughing) Do you have a voice-activated chip in you or something? - Unhand me you worm! - Hey, worm? That's kinda, hey, that's kinda strong. - You are repugnant to me as you might find a maggot distasteful. I tolerate you only because the process is still in its earlier stages. - Process? - There is the work I must do here and that which must be done on my world. - So, the guys weren't joking when they said you were an alien bong. - It is no joke. It is the beginning of the end for your world and the dawning of my dominance. - (laughing) You are a real downer, my brother. (laughing) - [Bong] You are about to go downer the rabbit hole. Oh yes, yes, smoke up, oldie. (laughing) (dramatic chiming musc) - Rabbit, no! (exclaiming) Oh, not again. - He's been abducted. - The bong got him. - What I said, abducted. - Perhaps we can argue semantics later, gentlemen. The bottom line is, Rabbit's gone. And perhaps the same thing happened to Bachman. - What is it with these fuckin' bongs anyway? Why do we always end up findin' these things? - Dude, they find us. - We have to help him. - Are you serious? Do you remember what happened last time? The last two times? - Well, we made it out. - [Brett] That's beside the point. We don't know what the hell's on the other side. Dude, I'll bet this alien bong wants to take over the world. It's part of an invasion plot. - Like Independence Day? War of the Worlds? This little thing? (quick intense music) - Don't touch me, you parasite. - Don't trip dude, we come in peace and all that stuff. - You insignificant specks of fecal matter. - Here's how we handle the invasion. - Wait, wait, wait, wait! If you destroy it we might never get back Rabbit or Bachman. - All right then, what do you suggest? - (laughing) Yes, scamper away you little pansies. (laughing) - Sweet Jesus. Whoa. (eerie music) - Man, I'm gonna have to get some serious weed killer. - Maybe it feeds on the stuff man, you gotta be careful. - Oh no, we seem to have encountered some kind of alien intelligence, or AI. - You mean A high. [Brett] Shit. - Okay Al, you're the brains around here. How do you propose we fight the alien bong? - Well, we were only able to defeat the king bong with the help of a certain person. Well, I mean, not a person, but-- - You mean the evil bong. Yeah, right, who wants to see that bitch again? Besides, we left her nag ass down in the jungle. - Well, no doubt Larnell's grandfather has her in his possession. He seemed quite enamored of her. - We left the old man down there too. Good fuckin' riddance. - Actually, he's not down there anymore. - How do you know? - Kinda been keeping tabs on him. - Why? It was my impression that your relationship with him was no longer cordial. - Yeah, he's been hatin' on you ever since your mom front-squirted you out. - I didn't wanna take the chance of him showin' up and surprisin' me again. Like he did down in South America. - So where is he? I mean does he run the local butt plug convention or somethin' like that? - Let's just say that Gramps has turned over a new leaf. (psychedelic music) - Is this the great beyond? Have I crossed over? (laughing) A bare angel. Oh, this must be my reward for all the good deeds I do. Or maybe not. Maybe it's not heaven. Maybe it's that other place. Well, Lord, if it is that other place let my punishment begin. (laughing) - Dude, you just sounded like a chick. - Oh, brother Bachman, I see you too have crossed over. - I don't know about that shit, bro. But I've been bangin' these chicks since I got here. They've milked me of so much monkey powder I don't know how I'm still standing. (moaning) - What do you mean by milked you? - Like, for safe keeping, you know like when I'm sleeping. See, the wang-looking tentacle combines with the aliens spunky to form like this super splooge. That's why it's great. That's not my normal color, by the way. And then they keep it in these jars. It's like they're tryin' to populate the place with a bunch of little baby Bachmans runnin' around. Cool, huh? - Brother, that fills me with a horror that you cannot even imagine. - If by horror, you mean fuckin' awesome, then I concur. - I don't know about this, girls. (nervously laughing) - Oh, just go with it bro it's all part of their game. It's cool, it's cool. - Geeky! (laughing) (moaning) Rabbit likes. I am full of joy. - Whoa, you're inside me, how is that possible? (laughing) (eerie chiming music) (faint laughing) - What the hell was that? - Sounded like Rabbit, he's gotta be in the bong world. - Are they killing him or what? (Rabbit faintly laughing) - Uh, he doesn't sound like he's in any distress. - He's gettin' his rocks off. - That doesn't sound like any kind of alien invasion I've ever heard of. - No, don't you get it, man? That's the genius of it. They attack us where we're the weakest, our anacondas. - I don't know about you, bro, but I'm strongest in my anaconda. (mysterious music) (throat clearing) (screaming) - Who was it summoned the good doctor? - That'd be me, Gramps. - You? - Yeah, me. It's good to see you. - You? - Yeah, me, it's good to see you. - Yes, well I wish I could say the same. But I enjoy my flare-ups of my genital herpes more than I do seeing your insipid face again. - Should've known you haven't changed. - Ah, but I have. You can call me Dr. Weed. And this is my personal assistant, Nurse Hookah. - (chuckling) What the shit? Are you tryin' to tell me that you're selling medical weed now? - Well, since my experiences in South America I decided to join the enemy, so to speak. And it's proved very lucrative. Not that you layabouts would know anything about making money. - Hey, back off, Jerry Garcia. This joint is my place. - Some impressive items around here but you will be foreclosed on within two months. - Oh, thanks a lot old man. - I was given to understand that the sell of medicinal marijuana was done only in pharmaceutical shops. - Ah, yes, I recalled you were one of the brighter elements in this gang of nincompoops. If one can make such comparisons among the lower forms, eh? But you were correct, nerd, in alluding to the popularity of the shops. But those are for amateurs, morons. They're targets for miscreant thieves. Pimps and gangbangers shooting each other just for a taste. Now, the only way to go is special delivery. So, let's get down to some business, et? Besides the traditional seeds and weeds I've got brownies, cookies, ice cream, even newfangled lemonade. One taste will blast you over the moon. (laughing) - Actually Gramps, we kinda need your help. - The only help you're likely to get from me is a retroactive abortion. - I should've known. But we're serious Mr., um I mean, Gra-, uh, Dr. Weed. - Really serious, Gramps. Like the whole world is screwed kind of serious. - What are you babbling on about? - Well, we're not sure but-- It's an invasion, aliens from another world planning a take-over of Earth. - Since the day your mother squeezed you out of her rectal cavity, you've been nothing but misery for me. And now you're giving me this bullshit about invasions from aliens? Let's get out of here, Nursey. - Wait, we can prove it, we think. (psychedelic music) - [Larnell] There it is, the advance scout of the invasion. - What of it? It's a cheap movie prop. - That's what I thought at first too, but-- - But what? Spit it out, you incompetent imbecile. - Two of our friends checked out, Gramps, we think the bong-- - We believe that there's a possibility that the bong has taken them. - You clowns must take me for the biggest rube in history. - Give it a sec, Gramps. (light music) Well come on, say something, damnit. Show us your power over us little ants. (light music) He's shuttin' us out, dudes, not cool. Bong's bein' a total D-bag. - Total D-bag. - No, no, no, wait, wait. There's something else you have to see. - Fuckin' astounding.! - Don't touch it. Its properties of reproduction and accelerated growth are beyond anything I've encountered. (laughing) - Indeedy, Nurse Hookah, a veritable gold mine. Where did you get it? - Oh, out by the old-- - Hang tight, Al. Gramps gets nothin' from us, not till he gives over somethin'. - Oh, so now you think you can bargain with me, huh? With your frazzled little brain. - Now, settle down, beast. We just think you got something we can use. - Yeah? Like what? - The evil bong, the bitch bong. - How do you know I have her? - Now don't snow me, Gramps, I know you got her. We left you down there in the jungle with her and no way you'd escape without taking her with you. - Yes, I still owe you for that, ditching me down there. You puss-oozin' pecker. - Let's just call it even for all the crap you dished out on me over the years. Right now, we're just lookin' for a little trade. Call it a loan. - I call it extortion. I think this thing stinks like a sumo wrestler's just taken a dump on a burning tire. - So where is she? - Who? - The bitch bong. - I have to go and get her, she's in a safe place. - Yeah, I'll bet she's in a safe place. - Very well. (muffled mumbling) There you go, pooky poo. (mumbling) There you are. - You tryin' to suffocate a girl? Damn. - It's all in interest of safety, you understand. - Mm! - Hmm. - Mm, safety, my ass. Your safety, maybe, honky. Tape on my mouth only pisses me off. Can't keep a woman down like that. - Yes, you're right sweetheart, I apologize, huh? - That's bad, Gramps, Dick Cheney on a goose hunt bad. - Ah, hell no, not those crazy white boys again. How many times you try to kill me already? - Uh, uh, well, uh, actually last time we all defeated the king bong together, if you remember correctly. - (chortling) I remember all right. Then you left me down in that hot, sweaty jungle, all them bugs and spiders crawlin' all over me. Oh, lordy! How do you plan to torture me this time, you little shits? - No torture, just asking for a little advice is all. - Advice? You mean, you want my help? - Well if you wanna put it that way. - Oh, wait a goddamn minute, what in the hell? Oowee. Hmm, now that is some kind of sweet, sweet weed. Wouldn't you say Doctor? - Just what the doctor ordered, sweetheart. Oh, we could do something with this on the streets. Uh, I mean, for medicinal purposes of course. - Oh, (chuckling) of course. - Wait a second, nobody's doing anything until we get a little help with our problem here. - What little problem is that? Your dick? - No, not his little monkey prick. This. - Oh! (dramatic music) - It's from outer space. - What you talking 'bout, Willis? - I mean this little problem could be your little problem. Could be the whole world's little problem. - In simplest terms, we believe an alien invasion may be afoot. - Yeah. - You dumb geeks have all done flipped. - Maybe you could just talk to it or something and just, you know, just-- - Talk to it? You dumb-ass cracker, what am I? Some side show act motherfucker? - Well, no, but I mean there aren't that many talking bongs and I just thought-- - There's only one of me and don't you let your lily white ass ever forget it. - But this one was running his mouth earlier, saying some really nasty stuff. Insults that were totally uncalled for and unprovoked, I might add. - This one? Talkin'? Shit, thing's nothing but a piece of junk. Let's grab some of this super weed and get out of here. - I concur, sweetheart. - You dare to refer to me as a piece of junk? My outward appearance is designed only to blend better within your rudimentary world. To better fool your simple minds. - Who you calling simple, motherfucker? - You are nothing but trash to be swept into the gutters of what you call the ghetto of this world. - Say what? (laughing) Let me at him, I'm gonna kill him! - Calm down now, sweetheart, take it easy. We'll take care of this imposter in due course, I assure you, huh? Well now. What do you guys propose? - Take it away. Here's what we're thinkin', Gramps. We want you to take a toke from that thing. Do a little research, do a little recon, report back to us. - (scoffing) You're insane. - We need E.B's help to help get our friends back, Bachman, Rabbit, and to stop this invasion from happening. - [Alien Bong] You think I cannot hear you? Fools! - She's gotta know how to beat him. - I don't know nothin' 'bout that fucker. Except he's an asshole. - You wanna get your hands on some of that alien weed? Then you're gonna help us out. - Why the hell would I go in there? - We've got what you want, pops, and you're not gettin' it until you help us out. Oh shit, she's damn strong. - Yeah, indeed she is. Grown from the finest stock. So, here's the new plan. While I could get greedy over the weedy and take what I want I have to admit that I too am a little curious. So, you guys are gonna go into the dragon's lair on this recon that you speak of and I'm gonna wait out here and keep my eye out on this, uh, stupid friend of yours. - Dudes, don't do it. There's no way you can trust this crank yanker. - Let me assure you gentlemen that Nurse Hookah is well schooled in all aspects of the deadly arts. And she wouldn't hesitate for one second to use them to extinguish yet another stupid dweeb. - Another? You mean she's done this before? (karate screaming) Not now, Larnell. Perhaps we should do as he demands. - [Larnell] This ain't right, Al. - Agreed, but we have one more demand of our own. - And what might that be? - We need E.B. to go with us. - Out of the question. - No, she's necessary for the success of this mission. - Oh, hell no. - I wouldn't let them hurt you, sweetheart, you know that, never. - Let's face it Gramps, there could be a whole lot more of this space weed where that came from. - (laughing) No you don't old man. I know that look in your eye when greed takes over. - Just think of it E.B. We could get what we wanted. An opportunity to take over the world with the greatest source of grass known to man. Leading to the rise, the unrivaled, unchecked rise to fame and fortune of the good Dr. Weed! - And you just gonna leave me out on street, is that it? - Oh, no sweetheart no, no, no, no, never. - Typical, honkey motherfucker. You gonna dump me for this white piece of ass, ain't ya? - No, no, no, no, Nurse Hookah has certain attributes but nothing to compare with you sweetness, huh? (light hopeful music) Sweetheart. (giggling and moaning) - Oh man, they're so gross. - Let's clip it along, Gramps, make-out sesh is over. Let's do this thing. - I'm gonna get you for this, hmm? Doctor Viagra. (psychedelic music) (choking) (suspenseful music) Mm, man, this thing creeps me out. - It is only because your simple mind cannot grasp the untold power before you. - Who you calling simple? - Excuse me, Junior, I don't believe I gave you permission to-- - Fuck your permission, bro. We gotta get in there. Pardon me if I use my own stash instead of that alien shit. - Oh this thin, weak earthly vegetation is an affront to my senses, but do as you will. - Oh I will, Tarzan, I will. - You offend me, you disgust me, you repulse me. Take me you worm. - This bong has issues, dude. - [Alien Bong] Yes. (evilly laughing) Humans are such easy prey. (screeching) (whooshing) - Whoa. (laughing) Okay Al, your turn. Come on Al, don't back out now. - Oh, indeed, no. Friends need saving, plus think of the discovery. - Whatever works for you, now suck it. - Hmm, admirable. Now join me in my world. (laughing) Let me blow your fragile mind. (whooshing) (laughing) - I hate to be the one to break this to you E.B., but you're next. - You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it, you're gonna get it! - Silence, wench. Let me take you. - Whoa, I feel like I went to an orgy but nobody gave me the butter. (laughing) - A new day has dawned. Soon our worlds will unite. (chiming music) (screaming) (panting) (moaning) - Rabbit? - They got me, man. - What's that noise, bro? - They got me hooked up. - Oh, they're jizz-milkin' you, Hoss. - They want our seed, man. - But this is some sick shit, bro. - You gotta get this off of me. - I am not touching that thing. - What if they're raising our babies to an army to invade Earth? - That's a new one. - Or maybe they're raising our babies to eat 'em. They're cannibals.! (sobbing) Cannibals, oh the humanity! - Calm it down dude, where's Bachman? - They got him, they got him so far out. - Hang tight. (yelping) - Don't leave me, man. (sobbing) No, don't leave me! No! - You're not alone, talk to Jesus. BRB. (mumbling and sobbing) (eerie music) (milking machine squishing) - The alien world, or the bong world if you will, seems to be comprised of very little physical matter. In here, this fog, these meager furnishings seems to be contrived merely to placate our human minds and possibly nothing else. Perhaps, in fact these images have been taken from our minds to serve no purpose except basically to give us illusion for our own benefit. Thus far, I have seen no sign of Bachman, Larnell, or Rabbit. Nor have I seen any sign of any alien beings. I have, although, discerned the sound of what can only be described as some kind of mechanical device. Example. (mechanical squishing) Hmm. Fascinating. Moving on to investigate. (eerie music) There's most certainly a machine at work here but I can't see anything in this foggy, oh! (grunting) I seem to have tripped on some living organism. (exclaiming disgustedly) There's fluid running through it. The fluid is being transferred from somewhere else into a series of vast jugs. What it is or for what purpose I cannot understand yet without further observation. (rhythmic squelching) Oh! The smell is unpleasant and pronounced, to say the least. The viscosity of it is similar to that of a consistency of a kind of material that I, I'm not entirely sure of but it's absolutely disgusting and it.... Oh, my. I seem to have encountered an alien being. Female, by all accounts, voluptuous in nature with a physical attractiveness an average male might find appealing. Is this the alien's true form or has her imagery been plucked from my memory? Although, I can't necessarily ever recall imagining a naked woman with images painted on her as if the brush strokes had been applied by some kind of sexual tagger. Oh my, the alien is amorous. (recorder clattering) Oh no, no, my field notes. Wait, wait, no. Oh my god, please, please, no. (chiming music) (laughing) - It seems your friend has made a scientific discovery, eh? (laughing) - He is now one with the hive. - The hive? What the fuck? - Yeah, yeah, hive. Don't you know what a hive is, simpleton, eh? - Yeah, it's like for bees and shit. - (laughing) Bees and shit. And all the insects, all the insects of the earth. Insects meaning humans, huh? Am I correct? - Rudimentary, but accurate. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughing) You mean to assimilate us, hmm? Not necessarily invade and destroy us. - Oh, uh, perhaps. - You want to live among us, share our world with us, eh? Not rule over us, huh, hmm? - That is one concept, yes. - (laughing) You see, boy? You've been worried over nothing. (laughing) - How much of your weed you been smokin', you stupid sag bag? This bong's snowin' you. - I think I'm old enough to be able to discern deception. (laughing) Even though my faculties may be slightly impaired because of certain hallucinatory elements. (laughing) Anybody got any pizza, eh? (laughing) - Man, you better not be smokin' that super grass that's growin' on the counter. You don't know what that shit'll do to you. - Ah, don't make me out a fool, boy. - Well you haven't been playing this one too smart so far. As far as I can tell you're playing right in to this helium bot's hands, or hoses, or whatever. (laughing) - I have it all under control, eh? (laughing) - Shit, Larnell was right. These aliens are gonna totally work us over. (laughing) (moaning) - Bachman? - Dude. - Bach, what the hell? - I've been probed, in my dong. - I knew it. - Hold up, white boy. (yelping) You don't wanna be touchin' that shit. - But I gotta help him. - How? Decorate your garden, use him for mulch? - Listen, bitch, if you're not gonna be constructive then zip it, all right? - Just tryin' to help. - Well if you wanna help then tell me what's happenin' here. Dude, they sucked me dry. - He's right, this boy's seed is history. His meat flute ain't playing no more tunes, baby. - My wacker's toast, bro. - Just hang on, B, I'm gonna think of somethin', okay, just... E.B., how about some suggestions? - Oh ho, so now you wanna hear from me, is that it? Done keeping a good woman down? - I'm sorry for snappin', okay? - Oppressive cracker. - How about some ideas here, E.B.? - Ideas wouldn't be a bad thing. I wouldn't mind getting out of here while the getting's good. - So? - Okay, look numb nuts. These aliens want some human seed. Don't know why, and I don't care. My guess is they're raising a bunch of imitation humans to help invade Earth. - Yeah, kinda like in Invasion of the Body Snatchers? - But with weed. (yelping) (gasping) - Aw, shit, monkey. - Just hang tight there, B. I'll get you out, somehow. Watch my boy, E.B. - Oh yeah, I'll do that. Idiot. (static crackling) (rhythmic squelching) (groaning) - Al? (groaning) Oh, they got you by the groin, man. - (grunts) Larnell, you gotta help me. I don't want them taking my essence. - I totally get it, man, that is some Mensa splooge. Valuable shit on the black market. - And it just, it just amounts to such an extreme violation. (squelching) (groaning) (yelping) - Oh, it sounds as if another has been brought into the fold. (laughing) - I don't know what you're smiling about old man. - (laughing) It's very simple, you ignoramus, eh? The aliens have their intentions set on taking over the world, and I for one have no fear because they are going to need humans of higher learning to give them assistance in maintaining the earth at a functioning level. (laughing) - And you think that's gonna be you? - I know it's gonna be me, eh? (laughing) Isn't that so, Mr. Alien Bong? - Why of course it is. - You're an idiot, you dirty old hippie. (gasping) (blow thudding) - No! Nurse, nurse, Nurse Hookah. Oh, oh, my. Oh my dear, oh dear. - Damn, that chick's got a hard noggin. - Stop! What the fuck? It's time to take it out! - And you think that's the best thing to do? - Fuckin' this thing up's the best idea I've had in a long time. - Then how are you gonna get in there and help your friends? - Okay, maybe you've got a good point. - Wise decision, though ultimately doomed for failure. - We'll see about that. (eerie music) - Yes, put your lips on that, you pathetic maggot. (water bubbling) (laughing) (whooshing) (groaning) - Buy a kingdom for a hard-on. Hello? Can you, well, I am spent. There's way, two ways about it, I am. - Rabbit! Dude you look like shit. What happened? - Those alien bong chicks. They attacked me, I couldn't-- - Dude, you didn't learn anything from last time? With the poontang? - Poontang. (chuckling) - You gotta abstain. Restrain, resist temptation. Come on, you idiot. (suspenseful music) (moaning) What the hell? Bachman? - Bro, things ain't going so good. - No, not so good. (moaning) You're a fuckin' Chia Pet. ♪ Ch-ch-ch Chia - You got screwed. - No shit. You gotta get this stuff off of me, bro. - Huh uh, huh uh, dude, I'm outta here. Rabbit? - Don't be a pussy, man. (laughing) - Rabbit. - [Bachman] Rabbit. - [Brett] Good luck. - Oh, guys, come on man. (rhythmic squelching) (groaning) - Holy shit, it's Al. (dramatic music) What do you think this thing is? Some kind of alien weapon or something? - Uh uh, Brett, uh, Brett. - I'm takin' these cock fuckers out. (yelling) - Brett I wouldn't do that! (shattering) (yelling) - That has some of those boys down. - Brother, I hate to break this to you but you do not want to know what that is you got all over you. - What? - Jizz. - Oh sick, oh these aliens are sick, fuck, fuck! - Hey, it's not so bad, it's not so bad. It's just a little of mine and a little of Bachman's. - That's my semen. (screaming) - Dudes! - Bro, look at this shit! - You got space wank all over you, babe. - What's happening to Al? - They still got him hooked up. They're milking him pretty good, too. (crackling and whooshing) - Mm hmm, they want that smart jizz. That's what they want. They thinkin' they can take over the world faster with smarts than with stupid. Gotta stop them. - I think what she's referring to is that our manhoods is lacking in certain intellectual properties. - Oh who gives a fuck, let's just get out of here. - What about brother Al? - I've never felt so alive. I'm in so much pain. It's cosmic. - Hold my bone. Be strong for me, Al, this might sting a little bit. - Um. (groaning) Ow. (whispering and karate screaming) I normally don't hit a lady, but you ain't no ladies. - Your joint, sir. That was monkey. - Uh, it was drunken monkey. - Right on, Al. Look at me, Al. On three. One. (screaming) (squelching) Oh god. (groaning) Oh god. - Now let's get that alien bong. - And just how do you propose we do that, spunky monkey? We're here in god knows where and that thing's back in the head shop. - I got an idea, I got an idea. - What you got, E.B.? - We gotta cause us a chain reaction. - Huh? - Wait, wait, wait. I think she has something here. I mean the effect of the bong, you know, reaches between both worlds. Maybe somehow we can reverse the process. - Yeah? But how? - Well, I figure we need a really strong catalyst, you know, something to jump start the process. - What did you have in mind? (smooth music) - Yeah, yeah. (laughing) Yes, yes, yes! - What? - You could be the catalyst. - Catalyst? - The conduit. Is that right, Al? - Correct. - (laughing) Hey, you're the walrus. - Coo coo ca choo. (psychedelic music) (karate screaming) (techno music) - All right boys, let's fire this puppy up. - Huh? No way, no, no, no, no. - Yes way, play like a champion for me Bach. - No, no, no, no, no. (blowing) Ah, ah, hot, hot, hot, hot. - [Larnell] Total team player dude. (groaning) - Hot, hot, hot. (moaning) it's hot, hot. (groaning) Sucks. (eerie music) (chiming) (moaning) - No, no! My female units! My force! - [Gramps] What's the matter? - Those worms, those bugs. They're using my weapons against me. Those scum, those insignificant parasites. - Yes, yes, I've been saying the same thing myself for years now, eh? Especially in the case of these cretins. These extremely difficult to exterminate parasites. - [Alien Bong] No! (gasping) (eerie music) (moaning) - Now it's time we send a message to the man, the bong in charge. - Dude, give me the honors. - Dude, you wanna toke yourself? - If you want something done right. That's right, light it up. Lean on over on me. (groaning) Give me a doobie, doobie, doobie. - Take your medicine. - [Brett] Suck, Bach. - With any luck. (coughing) (dramatic music) - No! No, no! (electricity crackling) (explosion booming) - That could have gone better. (beeping) (coughing) (explosion booming) (screaming) - [Bachman] Oh, oh, huh. Some pussy landed in my face. - [Rabbit] Praise the Lord. - Well, looks like you did it again, you stupid mother fuckers. - We did it. - Once again, I gotta thank what's in the good book. (psychedelic music) - Dude, I needed that shower. My clothes got pretty jizzy. - Well I for one could go the rest of my life without another alien invasion. - The one spot I gotta agree with you. - We might not have any choice, dudes. Those Area 51 aliens are gonna get out, no joke, and they are gonna be pissed. - I think that conspiracy theory has run its particular course, Larnell. - Not at all, Al. How do you think you'd feel if you'd been force fed malt balls for the past 60 years? - Fat asses won't be able to get out of their own way, let alone be any threat to us. - Amen to that, brothers. (cell phone chiming) - Shit, it's Luann. - What? What about the restraining order? - Think she cares about that? Chick's obsessed. (video game beeping) - These are for you, my sexy flower. (farting) - Sorry, I got angry ass again today. (sniffing) (soft upbeat music) - I want you now. Stud. - What? It's been a bit of a dry spell. - Go get 'em, champ. Yeah, at least he has somebody. Wish I could run into Velicity again. - You ought to look her up when you're in the neighborhood of South America. (chuckling) - [Bachman] You guys smell somethin'? - Somebody order pizza? - Velicity? What are you doin' here? - Oh, would you rather I go? - Fuck no. I mean, of course not. - Well don't just stand there like an idiot. (upbeat reggae music) - Man, I have missed you a ton. Been datin' five sisters on Palm Street every night. But seriously, what are you doin' here? - Well, when your grandfather disappeared in South America, so did my paychecks. He was paying me after all, so I decided I could use a change of scenery. So I left one jungle for another, and here I am. - That's great. How long you plan on staying? - Well, that sorta depends. - Depends on what? I imagine you're gonna be stayin' for quite a while, then. - Brett, what's wrong? I am so ready for you. - I'm not sure I can do this anymore. - What do you mean, snuggle bug? - Well, you made me feel bad about myself before. I thought you liked me for who I am. - Oh. I love you for who you are, hot stuff. You are so hot. Stuff. - That's just the point. You know, I like who I am now too. But you were repulsed by me when I was a little bigger. I'm still the same guy on the inside. - Oh you are so cute with your little emotions. Oh, those days are gone, right hunky? And this is now. And I want you so bad. - I guess you're right, I'm just being silly. - Of course I am. So show me the goods, beef cake. - With pleasure. (screaming) (scary music) What's wrong, baby cakes? - What about Grandpa? - Gramps, we forgot him. (eerie music) (playful music) - There we have it, Nurse Hookah. Gaze upon it. What is it? It's very simple. Destiny!
