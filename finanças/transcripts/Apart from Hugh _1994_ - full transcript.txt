[music playing] [ticking] I just had the most bizarre dream. I was back in high school. And Miss what the hell was her name? Anyway, I was back in high school, my English class, taking an exam in my underwear. The period was almost over. I couldn't answer any of the questions. I was so frustrated. I got up, and I walked over to the window, unlatched it, and flung it open, and just totally flew out. Or was I sucked out? You were probably sucked out. Probably. I flew over the city, and the mountain, and the forest. It was so beautiful, but it was so hard to fight the gravity. Well, then what happened? I don't remember. You know, I'd have dreams like this back in high school. My pen would be out of ink, or I didn't know the answers. And I'd just sit up, but instead of flying out the window, I'd ejaculate. And then I'd wake up all wet. That's funny. I don't remember having those. You don't remember waking up all sticky? You know what's funny? What's that? That you never tell me anything about your dreams-- nothing. Which ones? Any. Don't you ever dream about me? Oh. You mean my nightmares? You know, it's funny, but I never seem to remember them. I always wake up and there's nothing there, just a vague great feeling, like dirty white socks. I guess it's just lack of the imagination, not to be flying around like Superman all the time. You with all the imagination, forever inventing, always wander through buttercupped meadows, always wondering about all the what-ids. Oh yes, the what-ifs. I was thinking the other day, what if-- what if the French had beaten the shit out of the British and laid claimed to America? Uh, je parlais francais maintenant, oui? Ouais, but would another language have made us all that different? What if the old man upstairs had left hate off the list? Well, then we know that we couldn't possibly love then, could we? Everything has to have its opposite-- rain, shine, dark, light, you, me. I mean, it's all so carefully damn balanced, isn't it? No love, no hate. We'd be just a bunch of cows, eating, sleeping, shitting. And what if man had never had the urge to lie with man? And what if you just got up off your ass and fixed us some coffee? Awfully demanding, aren't we? And what if I just give you holy hell right now? Come on, lady. Geez. Can you get the lead out of your ass already? There they are. La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Wait a minute. Cognac for breakfast? Saturday, a day for indulgence. I can only see how fortunate I would be if you would stay with me through the rest of my eternal indignity. I've got a surprise for you. As if this isn't enough. I've invited a few friends over tonight. Nothing complicated. Just talk and laugh. You know, pass the ball around. Well, that's great, but why? I mean, god. Look at this place. It's a mess. Come on. When was the last time we had a party? I mean a real party. After hours don't count. Come on. When was the last time? Halloween? Yes, it was. And we decided we'd never have another one. Don't you remember Carl and Jerry? Oh god. Who could forget those two idiots? Carl finished off the champagne and started drinking whiskey. Of course, this was after Jerry finished off Carl and started fondling Tarzan. They were never right for each other, like two evening gloves. Love at first blight. And the way they went at it? The threats, the slaps, the tears? Carl and Jerry sing Gershwin. I don' think we ever saw those tools again after that. COLLIN: I think they ended up down in Seattle somewhere. Like that would ever solve anything. Well, no Carl and Jerry tonight. Unless-- No. So who is gonna come? Well, William and Grant, Dolly Pusher, Rob, Dina, and maybe her husband, Tina Rocker. Ah, I wonder what she'll be wearing. Everybody is coming that you'd expect, and then one. Really? Who? Not telling. It's a secret. Not your mother. I would have Carl and Jerry back first. So friend or foe? We'll be getting a phone call here soon enough. PHONE: If you'd like to make call, please hang up and try again. Hi, baby. What's your sign? Haven't we met before? Slippery when wet. Oh, same over here. That's my sign, mister. No, yours would be dangerous curves ahead. I don't know about that. Well, at least I'm between your legs and you're not between mine. Hey, watch it now. Getting a little personal, I think. Well? What can I get for you? I'll have a stinger, please. You got it. 85. You know, Ruby? Oh yeah, Ruby. She caught her flat on fire. No serious damage though. She got it put out. Oh god. What a stupid bitch ninny. Are you two really from England? You sure as hell sound like it. We just pulled in at 6 o'clock this morning, we did. Headed right for the ale. Did you leave the mini running? Forgot to turn her off again, eh? Don't know. Can't remember. Well, we've got to be back in England by 4:00. Certainly need to tank up. Cheers. Cheers, love. Okey-doke. [phone ringing] So where you from, love? Olympia. Where? Down south from here. I came up on the bus. I just got off after 4 fricking hours. Figured I could come in and use a beer. That's the capitol, eh? Yeah, I came up for the weekend to see some friends I haven't seen for a long time. In fact, one of them I've never even met before. WOMAN: Somebody get the god damned phone! Answer the phone. What? Who do you want? Just a minute. Call for Mike Hunt. [laughter] Is Mike Hunt here? You pig asshole. It's been a long time since I heard that one. What an asshole. It took me long enough too. Here, this one's on me. Thanks. I can't think of who it is. Who who is? It's me. Who who is. That sounds funny. What? Who who is. It sounds funny. You said I can't think of who it is. And I said who who is? Who who is, right. But who is this big secret that's coming to the party? I knew I shouldn't have said a word. Now I'll be badgered all afternoon. You know, you do this to me all the time. It drives me absolutely insane. Well, why don't you give me a hint for god's sakes? Just one little tiny clue, please? You're so sexy when you grovel. Who who is. Frieda's on her way up. Great clue. Whoa. But how did you-- I mean-- but what's going on, Hugh? I mean, you've never-- you've never even met her. She called here the other day while you were at work. We talked for a little while. And she just wanted to see how you were, what's been going on. We had quite a chatty time. Anyway, I thought, brilliantly, why don't we invite her up for a surprise visit? And then I thought, why don't we just turn the whole thing into a big party? You know, you're something. You really are. I just-- What? What is it? Is there something I don't know about? I shouldn't have done it. No. No, really. Why, thank you. Kind of you. You know, it's so funny how you can spend so much time with someone, do all sorts of crazy, semi-criminal things with them, rely on them so much, and then poof. One day it all comes to a sad, screeching halt. And you find yourself all to yourself again. I mean, it seems like it shouldn't work that way, but it does. What exactly is it? Fate, I suppose. It's a handy little word, isn't it? Yes, it's very handy. More brandy? Yes, please. So, the way fate worked it out, was it good or bad? I don't know if it's either. I mean, I'm here. She's down there, and now we're gonna see each other again. Maybe I don't understand what you two really went through. I mean, you told me enough about the crazy apartment that you two shared, the nonstop insanity that went on, living from one drink to the next. What? Is there more to it than that? No, not really. We had some quiet times together and some time apart from one other. Sure, there were lots of parties and lots of booze. God, we were always pissing people off. No one understood us or even tried. We didn't make any sense. I mean, now it seems sad. Well, funny sad. I unraveled. We didn't live any better than two mad dogs, except with listened to a lot of good music. Listening to Holiday was never as intense. I took on her pain, I think. I can't explain it to you, but I'll- I"ll tell you this thing and you'll think I'm insane. I already do. Living as we did, or as I did, it seemed, well, noble? After you stripped off all the veneer, all your self-respect, all your pettiness, your morals, your dreams, your guilt, and you have nothing but your flesh and your bones, and your hunger and your thirst, well, that's intense. You realize you are here in the naked present. I liked feeling that. It was raw, unpolluted simplicity. Nothing really mattered. Most people would never allow it to reach that point, to get that far. Or they do, and they never come out of it. Kind of like going to New Orleans for a holiday and forgetting to come back, I suppose. You've been there. I know you have. I think I've been there in a different sort of way than you. I like to go for the weekend maybe, but not a whole year. I don't think I've ever told you this story, but a couple of Septembers ago, I rented a cabin down at the ocean and went there for the weekend. It was complete with a whistling teapot and a potted shamrock. Anyway, I burrowed in. Saturday night, after I'd had quite a bit to drink, I walked. No, I stumbled down the footpath to the beach. I was screaming and yelling like a wild fool. But the roar of the ocean swallowed my cries. I stripped naked in wild abandon. I didn't notice if anyone was around. I didn't care. It was so cold. The water was biting at me. It was stealing my warmth and wanting my life. I felt so alive, so in the present. I ran back on shore. I felt like I'd made love 1,000 times. And I shudder when I realize how dangerous it was to be out in the middle of the ocean alone in the night. Supposing I wasn't a stable person. It could've been more dangerous never having done it. Touche. Tell me about Frieda. What did she go through exactly? Six pack a night. I don't know, really. When I'd had enough, I moved up here and she moved down there. We still write. You do want to see her, don't you? Yeah, very much. Yeah. You didn't just walk out on her, did you? No. Uh-uh. No. We knew it was time to pull up stakes. We had worked very hard at being hedonists. I just couldn't stand to eat dinner out of a can over the sink anymore. Oh god, Collin. How philistine. Now she's involved with Samson and Delilah or whatever their names are, painting houses. Her letters say that she's very happy. I'm not much of a pool player, guys. So don't get too excited. Great prize. Sorry about that. Some kind of a partner you're gonna turn out to be. Certainly ain't gonna win this way, are we? No. You're up, kiddo. What always worked for Grandma Bunny was to line up her shot, get a feel for it, close her eyes, and shoot. Sorry ass game, guys. You ought to stick to cake decorating. Let me show you how to do it. What a show-off. That's it, you pussies. I gotta go back to work. Oh, I don't believe you. Hey, come on. I'm not kidding. Yeah, right. It's just too-- Hey, this place is a lot of fun. Did you beat the pants off of him, mate? Aw, hell no. Oh, oh, oh, by the way. My name is Nancy, and this is my little friend Oliver, Oliver Twist. How do you do, milady? Oh god. Another fucking comedian today. So you said you came up to meet somebody? Anybody we know? Well, they don't go out very often. It's Collin and Hugh. Who? Collin and Hugh. Hugh. Doesn't sound familiar. Well, Collin and I lived in Seattle for a while. Then Collin moved up here and met Hugh. I haven't seen Collin since he left. I'm a little bit nervous. Hugh is the one that planned this surprise visit. He's having a big party tonight. Ooh, sounds like fun. This town could use a few big parties. There's parties all over. Well, then how come I never get invited to any? Well, all you needs a personality. Fuck you, you big asshole. Well! Hey, thanks for the game. Oh, I just screwed you guys up. No, you didn't. We were just killing time. Before we have to go a decorate a cake. Yeah, me too. Huh? I'm just fooling around too. Hey, have you ever seen anyone balance a schooner on a dime before? All it takes is a steady hand, absolute concentration, and the nose of Roosevelt. [laughter] [vacuuming] Should I get pistachios for tonight? What was that? Pistachios for tonight. What now? Pistachios. Does that sound good for tonight? No, absolutely not People are so god damned careless with the shells. It could end up in the couch, under the couch, everywhere. And we're the ones who pay for it. I mean, have you ever stepped on a pistachio in bare feet? Ouch. Picture this. I go in the kitchen one morning to fry you an egg. No sooner than I have the carton in my hand and I just step on one of those little shells. The pain makes me drop the carton. Now I've got a real mess to clean up. No pistachios. You are brilliant. You know people and all their careless, inconsiderate ways so well. No pistachios. Just stick to the pre-peeled foods, like little dainty things that don't make too many crumbs. How about those little weenies wrapped in dough? How about those? I don't want to make little weenies wrapped in dough. Come on though. What about that flat be-- bread. What's that stuff called? Pita? Pita, yes. That's it. Pita, pita, pita. Bake up a ton of garlic, make a spread with onions, avocados. Yeah, crumpled bacon. Mush it all up together. Fill it with the pita. Yes. Delicious. I know what we should do. Oh god. Frieda would love this. We had this after hours party, where everyone was just ripped. All we had was a package of those-- those cookies with the cream centers. And they were gonna be our breakfast. Frieda goes into the kitchen while I'm out entertaining everyone in the living room. She scrapes out all the cream center out of the cookies, spreads on horse radish-- No. Yes. Too funny. The looks were priceless. Frieda laughed so hard that she peed her paints. I thought that they were going to kill us. Collin, you really frighten me. Why don't you pick up a bag. Wait. Wait. Let me get this straight. You don't want pistachio shells embedded in the carpet, but you wouldn't mind seeing people toss out their cookies all over the place. [vacuuming] Shit. I know. I bet we're out of bags too. You better add that to your list. No, we have some over in the buffet. I just saw some the other day. I had one out the other day, because I was gonna make a really quick pinata. God, that's where that's been. What the hell's this? Did you do this? Oh, it's not finished. Just put it back. I can't believe it. You live with someone, and you think you know just about all there is to know about that person. And, whappo, you find out he's an artist. I think maybe you should explore this talent, young man. I don't want to. I mean, I only do it when the mood strikes. It's not that often. Besides, it's not that good, really. Not that good? It's very good. Finish it. You flatter me so. I'll flatten you so. Hand it over. Big brute. Because if I don't finish it, it can't be bad. Oh, I'll finish it. I'll finish it. So you're not involved with anyone right now? Just myself. No, I was until Christmas. I was with Tim for five years. And then what happened? I dunno. I mean, I know, but I don't understand. Psychologically, I think I pushed him out of the relationship. I mean, who understands the mind and all the tricks we pull on ourselves? You know, I go out of my way to set things up really comfortable for myself. Then I pull the carpet out from underneath my own feet, just to watch myself fall. Does that make any sense to you? No, but keep talking. Aw, fuck it. It's too complicated. Well, I drove old Sammy boy away. Don't ask me how, but I know I did. You know, I want familiarity and stability in my life. But give me a good dose of it and I start inviting havoc over for dinner parties. So you got bored with him. No, no, no. It's not that simple. I just-- I just miss him. God, why would I chase a good man like that out of my life? I don't know. Why would you chase a good man like that out of your life? Oh, I guess so I have to come down here and talk about on Saturday. Hm. And you? You with anyone? Uh-huh. I've been with them for about a year now. Them? I'm involved with a married couple. Hm? Oh really? Cha-cha-cha. It's what I want. It works out fine. It really does. Boy, I thought I was bad. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. I know you think I probably can't make up my mind. I ain't saying anything, honey. I just don't understand that. It is different. See, I don't just want him, and I don't just want her. I want 'em both. Any animals involved? Oh yeah. When they're gone. Don't listen to him. Just give him the shit. Hey, it's my shit. Actually, I should have some pictures of them here, too. Oh shit. What? I forgot my shoes. This is me. I forgot my shoes. I need my shoes. I can't wear the shoes I've got on with this dress. Are there any places around here where I can find some shoes? A second hand? Goodwill? A bargain place? -Well, yeah. There's plenty of 'em. Just go up the street, make a right. Go about five or six blocks. You can't miss 'em. You ought to find something. Hey, I gotta run. It's been great talking to you. Same here. Bye. Hey, the next time you get a guy-- Uh-huh. Don't screw up. Hello. Oh, hi. Can we help you? I'm beyond it. What do you think? Need us to Find anything? [MUSIC DALE DIAL, "LOST IN YESTERDAY"] Need a ride, honey? Where you going, baby? Want a ride? Harmony. I dunno where Harmony's at, but we'll give you a ride. No thanks. Jump on in. You can sit on my brother's lap. Nah, I think I'll walk. Come here, baby. Thanks though. Ciao. COLLIN: I wanna know where the hell Frieda's at. Maybe she took a later bus. Or maybe she met a fellow or a gal and got sidetracked. You said she's at the constant mercy of her whim. COLLIN: Oh, I've got it now. This is all a big setup. Frieda's not on her way up. There's no party. You want me to think this for whatever sick reason. I'm just not falling for it, pal. You know, you're going to get yourself in some serious hot water fooling around like this. Speaking of which, you know I never actually thought that I'd see her again? First, when you told me she was on her way up, I couldn't wait to see her. Now I just don't know. It's like the memory of Frieda's become more important than Frieda herself. Does that make any sense? Maybe it just wasn't a good idea. I mean, maybe she thought about it and decided it wasn't such a good idea. Well, whatever happens. What? Now you're angry? Am I right? Hugh? Hugh? What? You're angry, right? About what? You didn't hear what I was-- oh, never mind. Grab the jewels, honey. Here she comes. It's certainly no joke about Frieda and the party. It'll be one of the best parties ever given, ever to be remembered. Lots of gaiety, lots of guffaws. You know, I should have hired geisha girls to serve drinks and go-go boys to dance till dawn. Now, that would've been a party. Geisha girls and go-go boys? Well, I just want to look pretty for tonight. And you shall. Oh, parties. I love 'em. You know, there's people in New York who make a living just by going to parties? They have personalities so lively and so shrill they get paid to attend. They flit from one party to the next, like a butterfly from flower to flower. Well, when I flitted from party to party, I certainly never got paid for it. In fact, I was the one that ended up paying for it the next day. That's all these people do. I've read about 'em, professional party goers. A steady diet of gin and clap dip. Damn. Clam dip, damn it. Can you get my back when you're done? Hot yet? Cold. You know, Europeans are so clever. They put a faucet in the middle of the bath tub, so another person can sit comfortably at the other end. Oh, so you shared a bath all over Europe, huh? No, I just bideted. Wouldn't you like to go back? Yeah the both of us-- you, me, our backpacks, and a train timetable. Oh, to sit in an outdoor cafe, buy cheap wine, and ogle strange men in Madrid. Or buy strange men in Madrid and ogle cheap cafe wine. What an experience you must have had, vagabonding a whole year all alone in Europe. Wouldn't trade it for anything. You know, it's funny. Sometimes, I stop and think I did that. I don't know how. It's funny. You come back a different person, with pockets full of all sorts of change and socks eaten alive with holes, and a notebook full of romantic nonsense. You know, it wasn't without its hitches though. Hey, did I mention that Lodie and Fran are coming tonight? No. Uh-uh. What did France smell like? What did it smell like? I just imagine it has a smell like no other place. What did it smell like? Chocolate bread and coffee beans. And Holland? What did it smell like? Chrysanthemums and beer. Norway? Norway, what did Norway smell like? Sweaty man and fish. Now, there's an idea for the travel bureau. What's that? Scratch the pretty picture and smell the country. What about the US? Ah, the US, definitely the smell of liberty, money. Which, by the way, I'm going to be a little bit short on. How'd you do on tips last night? 50. Can you spare me 20? Uh-huh. You know, back in the last days of Frieda and Collin, I'd take a bath every Sunday night, a hot bath. I'd soak for hours. I'd keep thinking to myself, what am I going to do? I mean, what am I going to do? Maybe I should have been asking myself what am I doing? You know what? All I could think about is that I should get out of here. Every Sunday night, I'd think that. It was like planning some kind of escape. You know, one time Frieda and I borrowed this car off this guy. We took a drive up here, stopped at one of those little gas stations on Highway 11, one of those little places you didn't know still existed, the kind with a big porch and the dog lying underneath of it, a stand of fresh vegetables out front. Anyway, this guy pulls up in a pickup truck loaded down with hay. And out steps the most gorgeous man I've ever seen, all rugged, chapped. Even said hello to us. I could have left Frieda right then, waited for that guy in the front seat of his truck. I was ready to till the garden, slop the hogs, cut the wood, and fall in love. That's when I decided to quit the big city. So I did. Well, I'm not exactly planting raspberry bushes or slopping hogs, but at least I'm close enough to see him do it. So what you asking yourself these days? You know, I'm starting to think that we ask ourselves the same questions all through life. [knocking] I was almost raped. Oh my god. Wow! Oh god. Oh look. Hugh. How about a huge hug, Hugh? Hugh, this is Frieda. Well, I'll be. We we starting to get worried about you. Where the hell have you been? FRIEDA: I forgot to pack my shoes for the party. Then I got a wild hair at my house. COLLIN: But you should have called us. Next time I'll call. This is great. This is really great. And this place? I want it! Welcome to the other side, Frieda. Can I get you anything? Yes, new feet. Really though, I'm comfy. After the long bus ride this morning, the walk did me good, I think. I don't think I've ever been up here. Before. -Oh no. You remember. We did a car ride up here once. But it wasn't this far. This is great. I get to see my old buddy, and his new buddy, and a new town. We should have done this a lot sooner. That's what I thought too. I'd heard so much about you, and I thought we gotta have you up here for a visit. I tried to keep it a secret as long as I could, but this one over here finally wiggled it outta me. Hey, I've gotta head into town to pick up a few things. Is there anything you can think of that we need? Not me. I'm just ecstatic to be here. Garlic's in the oven. Watch the timer. And sure there's nothing else you need? How about some flowers? Pick up some tulips. Or pansies. -How about some pansies too? -All right. Well, I'm taking off. Bye. Stay out of the cookies. And the horseradish. The horse-- oh. I told him. God. He's a cutie pie. I like him. You know, I'm curious. I wanna know more about this couple that you're living with. Stan and Amanda? Yeah. Are they married? Uh-huh. They've been married for almost 10 years now. Gosh, I knew them way back in my Portland days. But about a year ago, I was down in a tavern in Belltown. And who do you think I saw? It was Stan and Amanda. It's been a while, but we talked and talked. And the next thing I know, I'm moving in with them. We get along so well. I hope you won't be too disappointed, but I'm not half as crazy as I used to be. Not that I'm boring. I've slowed down. Yeah, me too. Watch your step. I told you that we painted houses, didn't I? Mhm. Oh man. Does that take a lot out of you, inside and out. But they make it a lot of fun. Sometimes between jobs, we'll load up the can and head over to the ocean, find us some cheap little place for the weekend. Well, did you ever stay at a place with potted shamrocks and a whistling teapot? No, nothing that fancy. But sometimes we'd just park the van and pitch the tarp. It's who you're with, not where you're at. Ooh. Hey, watch your step. Be careful. Whoa. Whoa. Now where shall we go? Now Stan's teaching me to sculpt. And I'm really not half bad. Mandy and I have a great big garden out back. You'd love to meet them. Well, how old are they? Stan's almost 40, but he's looking really good. And Mandy, she's 35. They know how to have a good time. I just-- I just love 'em. I have missed you. I really have. I have to admit. I was a little bit nervous when Hugh told me you were coming up. And it got to be later and later with no phone call, I thought maybe you'd change your mind. What mind? Maybe you thought-- maybe you thought about the way I'd left. Oh, no, no. Don't. You had to do what you had to do. Hey, I'd never blame anybody for that. I was really upset with you for a couple weeks after you left. You know, you left and you didn't even say goodbye. I really missed you. It was really tough there for a while. But I knew. I knew. I guess I'm kind of worried that maybe-- I didn't know how you would take it with me coming up here and all. I don't know what you said to Hugh. After my phone call with Hugh though, he got so excited about having me come up. And then he wanted me to surprise you. My god. I don't know about that one. But here I am. Oh. It means a lot to me that you came up. Mhm. I haven't seen you in so long. It's worked out really good, huh? Hugh's great. Stan the man and Manda Panda is too. What's that the thing called with three people? Montage? Menage a trois ou la vie a trois. Yeah. You know, it's not the easiest thing in the world, swinging on both sides of the fence. I just can't have one without the other. I keep thinking, what if they get tired of my ass in this whole setup? What will I do then? I don't wanna be alone. No more. I don't wanna be alone no more. I don't wanna start something else. I mean, I have dresser drawers to put my clothes in now. Do you remember that stupid cantaloupe box I used to have for my underwear? So Hugh, he works with retarded children? You know, I think you'd do really well at that. Actually, they're mentally and emotionally disturbed children. Yeah. He only does that part time though. He goes to school full time. He's had this whole week off. I guess that must've been the reason why he decided to have the party. I didn't even know about it till morning. Mhm. Parties. I think it's a wonderful idea. I haven't been to a party for so god damn long. I got so excited. When I found out I had Mandy help me make this dress. Wait till you see it. So you would like to be with them for quite a while. Yeah. The longer the better. I don't know if I wanna be in a relationship with Hugh anymore. What? Who said that? I just don't know if that's what I want right now. Well, what do you want? Are you crazy? Of course you want it. Don't you remember calling me at 3 o'clock in the fucking morning? Telling me how sick you were of being alone? I do. I just moved up here. I didn't know anybody. And I missed you. I thought it was a mistake moving here, but I didn't wanna move back. I just felt like I was lost. Well, what does that tell you? I don't know. But, honey, if you're apart from Hugh, you're alone. And I'll be getting phone calls at 3 o'clock in the fucking morning. Have you given this considerate thought? But that's what I've been running from all my life, being alone. Maybe that's what I needed to be. I love Hugh. I mean, there's no one else. He's taught me a lot. But he's done so much in his life, and I haven't. I wanna swim alone naked in the ocean, wander around France, smelling it for myself. Or go live in the Tennessee hills in a commune with a bunch of men. I mean, he's even slept with women. OK, skip that one. He's done everything but collect the goddamn Nobel Prize. Give him a couple years. I still feel like a child, clinging on. But, honey. Ever since I was five, I wanted to be an adult. My parents friends would ask me, what do you want to be when you grow up? And I'd say, an adult. Now I wonder why. But you and I, we had our own freedom. We came and we went as we pleased. For a while, it was great. Then I had to force it to be fun. And that's-- that's why I left. Must be nice to be an old man, sitting in a rocker, looking out the window at all the dahlias, thinking how grand it all was, reliving each detail memory every afternoon with bourbon and sherry. I can't believe you. Should I just slap you into your old man years right now? So you can grieve about your lost youth and go pee yourself? I don't wanna leave him not ever to come back. I just wanna be on my own for a while, to really try it. He'd understand. But then, maybe he wouldn't want me back. Maybe I wouldn't wanna come back. If I stay-- if I stay, I'll start resenting it. I've written him a letter. I'll leave it with you, if you say it's OK I leave with you in the morning. I was just waiting for you to drag my ass in on this. I've just gotta do it. I've just gotta do it. [chattering] Did you know the last time that Tina Rocker and Dolly Pusher got together-- You know old Dolly-- Well, you know, they don't like each other. I mean, they really don't like each other. The last time they got together-- cat fight. They don't get along, OK? Good talking to you gentlemen. Don't forget, nude Twister at midnight. Hey, when did you get here? Hugh, oh, I just got here. -You look good. -You do too. What's going on? Where's your other half? Sammy? Yeah. Oh, I kicked his ass out at Christmas. Gone. You're kidding. No. Hell, I don't miss him at all. Good riddance to bad rubbish! Happy anniversary. Hey, thanks a lot. I'm glad you could come. Don't forget. Don't say a word to Collin, though. It's a secret. Hey, what are you up to? Oh, hi. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Do you know David? This is Frieda. Yeah, we're pool buddies. Oh, we met earlier today. How are things between you and Sammy? Are things OK between you and Sammy? I'm sorry to hear about you and Sammy. You know what? I was looking at your shoes. They are wonderful. They match great. Where'd you get 'em? Oh, you should know. Oh, no. Did you go to that place? Look at these things? -Perfect! -I mean, yeah. Excellent. I'm sorry about what happened. You know what? I gotta go say hi to Collin, so I'll be back. What was that all about? I met him at the bar. He gave me a sob story, and I was his friend. I don't know. I really don't. That is weird. I know. Well, I gotta check on the guests. How are things going? Good. See you in a bit. OK. Do you realize what's going on? I still wanna leave with you in the morning. Do you realize that Hugh is doing this? It's your first year anniversary. This party is all for you two. Oh no. Oh no. [chattering] First word. First syllable. Smoky. Pit. Pit. Toke. Turkey. No. Smoky turkey. Come on, honey.

And in case you don't know, though most of you should, it's been just about one year since I went down to the library on a Sunday night and saw Collin and started to get to know him better. And here we are one year later. So the whole idea behind this was to celebrate our first year, our first year of many years together. And so I've asked you to come here so I we could do that. So I hope you'll join us in a toast, and toast to this year. And which I hope will be the first of many years together. Watch it. Careful. So join me in a toast. [chattering] Cheers. Cheers! COLLIN (VOICEOVER): I wrote this a year ago. I was in a lover's apartment alone for the first time. It's called running. I've been running for a long time now. And I'm slowing down, unable to bear the cramping in my gut. Hence thrown above my head, I've become one foot and half of my body, slamming into the ground, left to right, left, the sensation keeping me from slowing entirely, forever, towards nothing. So I stay between faster and faster and stopping because I can breathe here. I can survive here. I remember yesterday afternoon, rising from my stomach to my knees, because I whispered fuck me, letting the wanting become word and him inn me, pushing out of my skin. I could walk around through the follicles of hair on my arm, release the scream I had been squelching for now and ever, tearing the sheets from the bed beneath, until I am thrown prone again to my stomach, knowing what lies between my body and the rest of the world, unable to understand what too much is. Collin? Collin? Are you listening to me? Collin, why did you invite that Tina girl here? You know how that upsets me. I can't believe I came all the way here and you invited her. COLLIN (VOICEOVER): A head severed once from its body and again its other half, left inanimate, to scream of disembodiment and dismembering, one of the two ears hearing, half the mouth speaking, longing for its other half like a third sex existing among the two others, that cannot gaze into their own eyes, kiss their own lips, or be severed.
