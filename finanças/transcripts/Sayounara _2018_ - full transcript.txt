Someone called the drifting sky the ocean. You called the trembling of an unreliable thin eyelash sadness. I called the slight touch between two pinkies love. Like something stuck to the bottom of a pan, Like a stain on a white shirt, Like a flower that dies before it blooms, Leaving behind an indescribable temperature, You went away. “What do you think you know about me?” You're right, but you never let me know you. “Feel free to watch me delicately decay. ” Ah, your end is so calm. SAYOUNARA You went home as usual. I forgot about it. Oh really? It's Tajima in Period 2. Help me! No way. Good morning. Morning. Going to the live show next week? Hmm. Not sure. I mean, I'll be playing, too. Show a little more interest. Good morning. Good morning. Did you study for the vocab test? No. I took my book home but didn't do it. Living on the edge. There's no more time. I just glanced at it. Liar. No. It's true. I just glanced at it and I'm not confident. What? You didn't study vocabulary? I left my book at home. You're quite a risk taker. Shut up! What am I going to do? Do you want to see mine? Really? You're the best. Thanks! See? You did a lot! This is incredible. Flashcards? It's easier to memorize if you write. I memorize better by saying them. Good morning. Good morning Mr. Fujiwara. Good morning. Takahashi, Mr. Tajima was mad at you. Really? Where is my parent-teacher conference printout? Sorry. I'll give you one later. OK. Now I'll take attendance. Who's absent? Seto, you're late. What happened? I'm sorry. I overslept. OK. Be careful. Now for announcements. Period 4 is P. E. today. It's in the schoolyard because of gym maintenance. And Thursday's. . Button your shirt. OK. After Thursday's morning meeting we'll have a fire drill. Please turn in the parent-teacher conference printouts on Friday. I'll give you yours later. How was the test? Terrible. How about you? So so, I guess. I bet it was easy for you. Sara wants to get together with our junior high friends. Oh really? Where do you want to go? I don't care. What about you? Maybe karaoke. Karaoke. I haven't been in so long. Good idea. I'll have iced coffee. Iced tea. Orange juice for me. Orange juice sounds good. I want something refreshing. Yuki. you were talking to Seto, right? Were you in junior high together? Yeah. We were in the same class in our third year. You guys know each other well. I've never talked to her. I get nervous when I talk to her. I know. I feel like she'll find out I'm stupid. Really? When you talk to her she's just a normal girl. Do you think Takahashi likes Seto? Takahashi? Not sure. I heard that rumor. Oh, you guys are here. We just got here. By the way, wasn't today's end meeting long? What Tajima said was so unnecessary. Exactly. Why wasn't Mr. Fujiwara there again? I don't know. Practical training, I heard. Hey, they have a new kind of cake. Really? I want to order it. They recommend it. Shall we order this? It looks good. Hey. You're coming back late. I was having tea with Mizuki and them. Momo, long time no see. What were you doing? Was she eating grass again? Yeah, she was. Is it OK for her to eat? No, she really chokes after she eats it. You're really mellow, aren't you? Let's go. She's really cute. How old is she again? She's 10 already. My brother is coming home during the long weekend. Wow. He rarely comes home. He's going to a class reuinion. He's going to be 20 next year. Really? 20? I wonder if we'll have reunions when we're 20. I wonder too. But if someone organizes them we probably will. Right. Maybe Sakaguchi. Sakaguchi! He would definitely want to do that. Because he likes to organize things. There are plans for the girls to get together. Really? Do the guys do that? I don't think so. But maybe I'm just not invited. Poor guy. Shut up. OK. Summarize what we covered so far and give a presentation next week. If you forget, you have to stay after school. You can't go home until you finish. You can't go home until you finish. You suck at that. He was definitely saying that to you. The next time you forget it won't be pretty. Right? I'm screwed. Hey, Seto! The movie you told me about was great. What else is good? Is it OK if it's a little more boring than that one? Sure. Then what about this? Wow. I like the cover already. Really? Then check it out. Thanks. See you later. You watch movies? Yeah. New members get a month of free viewing. She went there to get his attention. Unacceptable. What a whore. Exactly. She's gross. Who does she think she is? I heard they had a fight. Tanaka was crying in the bathroom. I guess he had a fight with Imai. Shuhei. Heads up. Pass. Can I play? Sure. Takahashi. Watch out. What? What are you doing? The poor girl. Sorry. Sorry. The next person to let the ball get away is buying soda. What? Hey. If you don't clean we'll never finish. Ohashi! Wanna come to the live show on Friday? Sorry. I'm cleaning right now. You're not cleaning at all. If you take over for me I'll go. Really? Then I'll do it. Find any good books? What about this one? What is this? I think our teacher would like it. But it looks difficult. I want to go to a planetarium. Good idea. Let's go! I want to. I wonder if there are any around here. I found a pretty good book too. This. The Ocean's Memory. Yeah. The ocean! Because I like the beach. There are a lot of books about the ocean around here. Really? Me? Yeah. Can you tell? I can! It looks like you, right? Does it? Your hair is getting long. Has it grown? It has. I'll draw it longer. How long do we have again? What? This. Oh. You'd forgotten about it, hadn't you? "Don't steal water. " It's this, right? Let's use that. If we put in this kind of thing he'll say we're creative. I want to go to a festival. Me too. A fireworks show. A fireworks show sounds good. Don't you want to set off fireworks? I do. Sparklers. Bye. What is this? What is this? Stop that. Hold this a minute. It's too hot already. It's hot, right? I'm hot. By the way, Do you put on suncreen every day? No, I don't like it. Really? Yeah. Me, too. It's sticky and gross. Right. During P. E. class, I rubbed my eyes after putting on suncreen. Oh no. It really hurt. I've done that. Really? I asked Sara where we should go. They want to visit our junior high. I wonder how Mr. Tani is doing. Not even a year has gone by since we graduated, but I feel nostalgic. Oh, Mr. Tani. . Yuki, Do you remember Mr. Suzuki's funeral? It was last year, right? Everybody was crying. Except you. You didn't cry. Is that right? Yeah. He was a good teacher, But I wasn't that deeply attached to him. I don't think any of us were. I didn't particularly like or dislike him either. You know what? I'm moving. What? It's so sudden. Why? My new dad is being transferred by his company. Oh. I won't be able to meet you anymore. The wind feels good, doesn't it? "This is crazy. I heard Seto-san is dead. " "No way. I can't believe it. " "I heard it was an accident. My mom works with her mom. " Kishimoto-san? Yes. I heard from Mr. Fujiwara that you were close to Aya. Thank you for being good to her. Not at all. It doesn't feel real. You never expect a high school student to die. She would've had lots of fun things in her future. Right. I still can't believe it at all. Yeah. This is tough. Shouldn't we get the day off? No. What are you talking about? Trauma and such. Cut it out. Everybody's talking about Seto. It is a shock, right? She was in the classroom just the other day. I've never talked to her, but Seto-san was really kind, right? No, Seto-san was a bitch. She acted like she was better than everyone. Don't speak ill of the dead. Well, I don't know much about her, but it is a shock. I think that's true for everyone. Right? Good morning. Good morning. It's awful, isn't it? What? About Seto. Oh. Hey, did you hear about Seto-san? You mean that she killed herself? Right! Everybody's talking about it. Is it true? It wasn't a traffic accident? That's what I thought. Right? Did she have problems at home? I wonder. But everyone is saying it, right? Does that really happen? Did something happen? Rumor has it Seto-san may have killed herself. I wonder if it's true. I wonder. Who knows? It was an accident, right? But I heard she had problems at home. Did you hear about her? What? Right. Right. Is it OK to say it? It seems Seto-san may have killed herself. Is that the rumor? Why? I heard her mother is on her second marriage, and. . Seto-san was being abused by her stepdad. Isn't that gross? You never knew what she was thinking. Honestly, it makes no difference she's dead. No difference. I don't care. What the hell? Are you OK? Do you want to use this? What the hell are you doing? Are you OK? I heard you poured water on her. Why? I don't know myself. Well, watch yourself. Miyu. Miyu. Look at LINE. Is this true? Did you see it? Crazy. Did you see yesterday's? No. The one you talked about before? Yeah, a TV drama. I fell asleep. Why didn't you watch it? I told you to. Good morning. He looks good when his bangs are messed up. By the way, is the Rumor Seto-san killed herself true? Don't know. I feel like someone changed the topic. What? But I wonder what really happened to her. Scary. What are you talking about? Go exercise. Why? Takahashi isn't so great today. Yes he is. I'm talking about his bangs. Bangs?! But he's playing really well. But Takino is great too. Not fair. Thirsting Kong. What's that? Can I have some? Which one? This one? Isn't this the most important one? It looks yummy. I envy you. Why don't we go to karaoke? What about you, Manami? I might want to go to karoake. But you almost never sing. It's fun to just listen. Really? How many hours? Are we gonna do that scoring again? Why not? Let's do it. Takahashi, sing that song you sang last time. I've been meaning to tell you you're trying too hard. It really bugs me. You're too mean, Taichi. It's good that she has empathy. I can't do that. You should try harder. Really. Oh no. Shit. Thank you. Let's see. Tomato. . Thank you. Lemon. . Could you set them down over there? Hi. What happened? The bag broke. Oh, you helped him. Thank you. I got word that Emiko may be having problems. I'm gonna take her to the hospital. Is she OK? I think so. Please watch the place for a bit. Give me a call anytime. OK. Do you want to drink something? Um, how about iced tea? So you go to Nana High. Is Fujiwara there? He was my classmate. He's my homeroom teacher. Wow. He's really a teacher. Wow. Did you start working here recently? Yeah. Just while I'm back in town. The owner's wife is about to give birth. Here you go. Thank you. Aya said the same thing to me. "Group for the field trip" You have too many members. So what? It's not a big deal. Some of you have to go to other groups. He's too strict. OK, I'll go. Why? You don't have to. Mr. Fujiwara, 7 people is fine! OK, then I'll go. See? They'll take me. You're going Manami? Maybe sweet potato strips. Cool. You like them. What about you, Nishi? Bananas. Bananas. Oh, right. Bananas. Can we add one more person? Sure. Okarin. Can you guys take Manami? You have just five people, right? Sure. Thanks. There you go. You can join us for lunch. Let's eat together. You guys are friends? Yeah. We were talking before, right? I didn't know that. Huh. What will you do? What are you going to wear? Kishimoto-san, do you want to join Uchida-kun and us? Over here. Thanks for the other day. What do high school girls do these days? Hmm. . I don't like to go out much, so I watch YouTube at home. That's so modern. Do you post selfies on Instagram? Why? You don't? No. What were you doing before you came here? I was in a band. Really? What instrument? Guitar. Wow. Aren't you going to play anymore? Probably not. What was the name of your band? I want to listen. Never mind that. Do you like music? I do. Let's see. What have I been listening to lately? You're surprisingly modern. Hello. Come on in. Thanks for the drink. Thank you. Where are you going? The convenience store. Are you on a walk? That and going to buy lunch. See you later. Hey. Welcome home. I'm back. Hello. Oh, Yuki! It's been a long time, Ayumu. Your hair grew. What are you reading? It looks good. Yuki, Which things should I put in the refrigerator? Wait a second. Where's your mom today? She isn't feeling well. She's lying down upstairs. Is she OK? Recently she's been fine. But today she happens to feel bad. I see. Put all the skins here. How have you been recently? Do you want to hang out with our group? That's OK. Recently I don't care about that kind of thing. And it's not like I talk to no one. I'm fine. If there's anything I can do I will. OK. OK. All good. What should I do next? Mix in the egg? Sure. Eat your green peppers, Ayumu. Yeah. You have to eat it all. OK. How tall are you, Ayumu? At school we got measured and I was 135 centimeters. Really? You grew? You're in a growth spurt. Yeah. I envy you. How tall are you, Yuki? 164 centimeters. You have a ways to go, right? Hi Yuki. It's been a long time. Hello. Yuki made this for our lunch. Thank you for cooking for them. There's some left so please help yourself. Thank you. Are you OK? You still have some green peppers left. Well. . Mom, he's not eating his green peppers. He won't eat them. I'm eating them. We can only spend 500 yen for snacks, But I'm always way over. What did you buy? Just some sweets. Have you seen this before? It's new. Try it later if you like. Thanks. I'm looking forward to the free group activity time. But we don't have that much time. I hope I can buy souvenirs. My mom asked me to buy one thing. OK, is everyone in their seats? Now we're going to leave and take an expressway. It'll take 2 and a half hours. We'll stop at a rest stop for a bathroom break. Is everyone OK? I'm cold, Mr. Fujiwara. I want to go home. Your mom is really beautiful, Takahashi. Do you look like your mom? People say I look like my dad. Really? I want to see him. He's got to be good-looking. I forgot to bring a drink. Really? What did you say? I forgot to bring a drink. Does that happen? I think I want a softdrink. There's a vending machine over there. It's a pain in the ass to go back. I remember where it was. I can go buy drinks. Really? Can you buy one for me too? Sure. What do you want? Not sure. Take a picture and send it to me. OK. Can I have some? That barn was cool. The horse manure was heavy. That was cow manure. Not horse, cow. Really? Oh right. You're right. My mistake. You shouldn't talk about that when we're eating. I've never eaten it myself but I think horse dung sea urchin looks like that. I haven't either. Whoever named that food has something wrong with them. I know. It's horse dung! Combining horse dung and sea urchin! Where are you going? To the bathroom. Kishimoto-san seems mad, doesn't she? Really? I don't think so. She looks mad, right? Kishimoto-san? Are you alone? Which group are you in? Miyajima-san's. Don't be insensitive. You girls have it tough, don't you? What are you listening to? For Tracy Hyde. Really? You listen to For Tracy Hyde? Do you have he(r)art? Yeah. What are you guys doing? Just talking. What about you? Going to the bathroom. How about this one? It's not a band but . What's For Tracy Hyde? A band. Really? I have the album so I'll lend it to you. It's a really fucking great album. I'm so happy. How do you know them? You really like them. Why are you being such a gofer? Excuse me. It's time to go back. Thanks. Kishimoto-san, Were you good friends with Seto-san? Why? I'm home. Hi. Welcome back. Was it today you were coming home? I told you this morning it moved up a day. Oh yeah. I forgot. Long time no see. Why aren't you at school? She had a field trip today. Really? Was the weather OK? No, I got soaked. Hey, you're wearing a checkered shirt too. Go change. You take yours off. You'll catch a cold. Go change. Have you been eating properly? Yes. I have. Do you just buy something? Yeah, pretty often. You have to eat properly. Where's Dad today? He had to go to a party and he'll be home late. You're going out in the day tomorrow, right? Dad wakes up late on the weekend so you may not see him. I don't really mind. But you only come home once in a while. You should eat with him at least once. She should tell him that. How's college? Do you go to class? Yeah . He does not. It's suspicious. I do. I doubt it. I'm earning my credits. What about you? How's school? The usual. How's Keita? He's fine. Oh, on that topic, her classmate died in September. Really? How? An accident. There's that road along the ocean near their school, right? It has some fender benders now and then. You went to the same junior high, right? Yeah. I feel so sorry for her parents. Are you OK? Me? Is college fun? Yeah. It's fun. Clubs and such. No one puts out flowers for her anymore. Now that you mention it, you're right. It's weird to have them forever, but also weird they're gone. Right. Where are you going? To the bathroom. I think Seto-san rejected him. Really? When? It was before summer vacation. Careful. If you tease him about it he'll get mad. Oh really. How do you know that? It's easy to figure out. Right? Kishimoto-san! Here's the album I told you about. You're so fast. I want to talk about it soon. The mixes on the last two songs are awesome. Listen to it soon. He's such a pest. Not at all. I'll give it a listen. Thank you. By the way, I'll be playing next week. You should come. A live show? I've never been to one. It's fine. Lots of people come by themselves. Also, I'll give you a discount. Where will it be? A club five minutes from Hon-machi. I'm not going, though. Why not? I have to go to cram school. Live performances are one-time only. But you'll have a lot more shows, right? Well. I have a mock exam. You never know what will happen to me! Same with me. Wasn't that funny what happened at lunch? It was too much, right? She was overdoing it. Yuki only talks with guys and she thinks she's cool. They just feel sorry for her because she's alone. It's creepy how that ugly bitch gets all excited. You're scaring me. And what is Takino thinking? But don't you think he's good-looking? Watch it. I'll tell Soma. I'm joking. It really makes me sick. Yuka? Mr. Fujiwara was looking for you. Why? About your preferred conference time. Really? I'm tired. See you. Bye. You haven't told him yet? Not yet. Shall I hold that for you? Go! Go! Cut it out. Wait for me. We will. But honestly, I want to stop teasing Yuki. It's not our problem, just Yuka's. You really saying that? Risky. I don't care about her. Exactly. Her reactions are so muted. She's so normal she brings me down. Erina, you're making me laugh. Seriously, Yuka goes too far with Yuki. She should just leave her alone. Yeah. Her reactions are so muted. Kishimoto-san! Thanks for coming. You go on third, right? I'll be the next one after the next one. Next after the next. OK. Are you nervous? Too nervous. Hey. Who did you come to see? My friend's band. Oh really? Wow. You're Oshino-san from Scud, aren't you? I saw Three Man last year! You guys were so on fire! Thanks. No. Thank you! What? It's Oshino! What's going on? Are you back? Come on. Talk to me. Do you know him? Sort of. He works at the coffee shop near the school. Really? Really? Is he famous? He's super famous for someone from here! He was in an indy band, but they had tons of fans. It's incredible. Sorry to get carried away. Ren, Ren! It's time to go. Oh, sorry. I should go. Good luck. Remember. . That I was alive here. Thank you. Today, of all things, Scud guitarist Oshino is here. What are you doing? I don't want to do this. Stop it. Really, just stop it. Good evening. I'm Oshino. How long has it been since you were back here? Well, the last time was last May. Last May was. . Three Man! That's right. It already sounds nostalgic, doesn't it? What song are you going to sing for us today? No, no, no. You're on the stage. Why not sing? I'm not going to sing, not today. That again? I don't have anything with me. You do. I have a guitar right here. You jerk. In that case, I'll play a nostalgic kind of song. This is an old song that's been used in a commercial recently. The clock's hands are chocolate I want to melt them with our passionate love If you kissed me They would drip down second by second Thank you for telephoning me yesterday I could tell from the atmosphere you had something you wanted to say I want to give you my first kiss But I realized from your makeup I can't tell you that The last song was really good. Really? I'm happy you think so. There's going to be a celebration party here today. Do you want to join us? A lot of audience is going to stay. I don't think I'll go. OK. Well, thank you so much for coming! See you! Invite me again. I definitely will. OK. Thanks. See you later. Take care. Hi. Hi. Aren't you going to the party? No. I'll walk you to the station. What did you think of the show? It was my first time, So I didn't really know what was going on. But it was fun. Hmm. I see. So your band was famous? You don't like music anymore? Well, they say continuing is the hardest part. For anything. Do you have anything you enjoy? I'm not sure. Do you have any friends you're close to? Is your music on YouTube? I think it is. I'll listen to it. Really? You don't have to. I will. Oshino-san was there yesterday. Isn't that cool? Kishimoto-san, thanks for yesterday! Good morning. I'm sorry I couldn't really talk to you. Were you OK by yourself? I was totally fine. It was fun. Really? Listen! The band that came after us was really great! I bought their CD. Really? Lend it to me. Sure. Me too. Wait your turn. Each group come to the front to get your lab equipment. We have to go get it? I'm tired. Manami, can you go get it for us? That's asking too much. I feel sorry for her. Please. OK. Really? Thanks. You're the best. The best! So kind of you! Recently you and Takino are pretty tight, right? I just went to see his live show. I see. It's kind of surprising. Sorry to keep you waiting. OK. We start with Experiment No. 1. . Pour water in the beaker. This? What's wrong? No. It's just. . What? Will you be my . girlfriend? You shouldn't ask me. I've been kicked out of group. You don't have to worry about me like that. See you later. Someone called the drifting sky the ocean. You called the trembling of an unreliable thin eyelash sadness. I called the slight touch between two pinkies love. Like something stuck to the bottom of a pan, Like a stain on a white shirt, Did you see Gachi Talk yesterday? I did! Sakoda was so funny, right? I saw it too. I didn't. You're kidding! It was so funny. Late night shows are amazing lately. You should really watch it! Are you guys free this Sunday? Yes. Do you want to go to this? Whoa. That would be awesome. It's held at the end of the month, but let's go, just the three of us. We're gonna look so good! Cool! Are you OK? What's wrong? What happened? She says she has a stomach ache. Are you OK? I'm sorry. For starters, let's warm your stomach and have you lie down. OK. Can you tell your teacher she's going to take the third period off? OK. Thank you. Let's lie down a while. Kono-san is resting in the nurse's office. I see. You went with her? Thank you. Because of just that? What a loser. Did I say too much? It's OK. Recently Anzai and them are out of control. They're all desperate. I think Shuhei will be turned off by that too. I want to eat this. Why don't you order it? Hello? Can I have the 3-fruit parfait? OK. Oh yeah. I heard you said Takino is good-looking. What? No I didn't. Who told you that? I only care about you Taichi. Are you OK? What do you mean? All right! I got a loot box! Let me try next. You die too fast. I've gotten a lot better. Not right now. You don't get it. You're so quiet. Shuhei, Did you really like Seto-san? Why ask now? If there'd been a little more time I would have started to like her. Really? What's wrong? Trouble with Matsui? No. We do it all the time. What the hell? Nonstop. Well, Seto-san's gone now. Sex talk? No. You're talking about sex, right? You're so clueless. By the way, why are you so bad at baseball games? Am I that bad? You suck. Worse than me. "School-life questionnaire" It's about anything that bothers you. About yourself or someone else. Even small things. It's up to you whether to write about it. There's a lot going on with the girls, but nothing with the boys. Soma, you're being harsh. Soma, be quiet and write. To begin with, what about Seto-san? Why are you talking about her now? There were weird rumors and we didn't know what really happened. But she was being harrassed. It's a questionnaire, so if you talk it negates the purpose. I didn't know Seto-san was being harrassed. It's a questionnaire. Concentrate! Did you know? I didn't. Come on! She startled me. What is it? She's scaring us. Is she going to the bathroom? Ms. Bathroom? Is her name Ms. Bathroom? I took Seto-san's gym uniform. Anzai-san and her friends told me to and I did it. I don't understand what you're talking about. But you girls said all kinds of things when she died. Shut up, Soma! Scary! We're in the middle of class so be quiet! You shut up. Do you have any proof? Holy crap. I mean, usually you wouldn't kill herself over that. OK, it's no use arguing here. I will talk to you individually about Seto later. Have a seat, Noda. Who do you think you are? You're full of it. Anzai! Yuki-chan, can I take the train home with you? Sure. Actually, I didn't feel very comfortable around Seto-san. I was in Yuka's group and I was always trying to fit in. I figured she must have thought I was a fool. I really wonder why Seto-san died. Yeah. Actually . I'm being shunned by the girls in my class. Why? I poured water on the girl who is the leader. What? Never mind the reason. And I could be talking about anyone. But do you think I and those girls, when we're adults, will be able to look back on this and think it was stupid? I think nothing changes no matter how old you get. You just get better at acting like an adult. At least I can say, if it's important to you, it's not stupid. What? No, I was just thinking, you're such a grownup. Do you really think so? Yes. If you have that out, Mr. Tajima will get mad at you again. It's fine. Good morning. It's a secret. Good morning. Good morning. Did you sleep well? Yeah. Because recently I haven't been sleeping so well. I'm glad. Me too. Did you finish your homework? Did we have homework? Yes we did. Really? Hi. What are you doing? I thought I'd go ahead and finish my homework. I'm about to turn mine in. Are you done? Just a little more. Is this right? Yeah. OK. I'm done. Did you think about it? Are you serious? Yeah. I like you, Keita. But . honestly I don't know if I like you romantically. That's OK with me. So let's date. Never mind whether you're being shunned, since Seto died you've seemed far away. Yuki, with Seto, were you . I'll turn this in with mine. Why are you here Aya? What's going on? You're supposed to be dead. You don't say anything. Aya. Aya. Why did you kiss me that time? That was my first kiss. And when you talked about Mr. Suzuki's funeral, That was foreshadowing your death. Were you being considerate? Why won't you say anything? You rejected Ohashi, right? I don't really care though. Takahashi must have liked you. You could have had a good-looking boyfriend. It's too bad. Why did you go and die? Yuki-chan. You . After I died, you didn't cry. Someone called the drifting sky the ocean. You called it sadness. You went away. "What do you think you know about me?" You never let me know you. Ah, your end is so calm. If that's true, it can't be helped. If that's true, it can't be helped. Do you think the truth is inside you noisy people? You're so disappointing. Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry about earlier. It's OK. Me too. Our dad died and our mom became the way she is. If you hadn't been around, I couldn't be doing what I'm doing now. So no matter what happens to you in the future, I think I'll always be grateful to you. I just wanted to say that. I understand. I wonder what will happen to me.
