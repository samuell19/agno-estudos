You can? Great, thanks. I'm a big spender today, taking a cab! I'm grabbing a drink with Lisa. If I'm late, I'll slip into bed quietly. I promise. Dr. Turell "Say goodbye in the most beautiful of ways" FILMING I'm Doctor Turrell. Welcome to 120 Rue de Lyon, in the heart of the Bastille Opera. My team and I have set up shop here to relieve your heartaches and heartbreaks. Thank you, Diego. We've seen that for many years, love stories have been ending badly. This unfortunate situation calls into question the many beautiful years you spent with your spouse, and leaves 95% of you with a bitter taste in your mouth. Separate in the way you came together. Say goodbye in the most beautiful of ways! Here, in the heart of the Opera, our team is at your service, ready to create your most beautiful goodbye scenes. It's over, Bertrand. The scene is filmed by our crews, and naturally, we will give you a cassette to take home. Options, terms and conditions are available on our hotline. My secretary will be happy to assist you. Putting the good in goodbye, Professor Turrell's office, hello. Yes, Marcus? How so? Let me speak to her. Yes, madam? Good evening, madam. Professor Turrell is with a patient. What's troubling you? Yes? Number 237. Your file says the breakup will be at a dancehall. Have you changed your mind? Number 237! We do everything we can to fulfill your desires. Maybe your ex-boyfriend finds it more romantic? Sandrine, what's going on? I rang the machine 3 times but nobody came in! Number 237! Sorry, that's me, miss. "Miss!" This way please, sir. Your thoughts on the bell? Excuse me? Sherwood Forest! Great, I guess. I'm not convinced. We'll find one. Is this your first time here? No, I came two years ago to see La Bohème with my girlfriend. I mean here in my office. Yes, I never knew this kind of stuff existed. So how did you find this kind of stuff? Sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. When you get so much advice from loved ones, you end up believing anything. I was your age when I first set foot in this office. Really? Have you always worked at the Bastille Opera? I'm a doctor, sir. I'm here to try to cure broken hearts, not to entertain them. 237. Take a seat, put your documents on the table. I brought you the phone message, and... the photograph. The last memories I have of her. Right, Mr. Prigent! I remember now. We usually handle cases where both parties are in my office to say their goodbyes. Whereas your partner has died. I'm afraid our services may not be enough to alleviate your pain. I figured as much. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Mr. Prigent... Here, time is what we heal. Have a seat in the chair. I'll examine you. That's right. Good. Follow my little finger. I'm going to slap you, but it's no big deal, okay? Nice! Very good. Open your mouth. Stick out your tongue. And give me a nice "ah"... Professor! - No! - Yes! Emergency. Problem with the dancehall set. The patient won't do it. I'm examining a patient, Sandrine. The woman insists she can't dance and refuses to say goodbye that way. That's all. Right. What kind of music is it? A waltz. Do you suppose she can count to three? I would imagine. One, two, three. So tell her everything will be fine. - That's it? - Yes. - I'll tell her. - Great. They cut the motor. One moment. Marcus! - Yeah? - Come! In your file, it says... "Interior, night... car." - Yeah. - Is that right? I imagine myself joining her on her final trip. Maybe it's ridiculous, I don't know. Imagination is the eye of the soul. Let's take a closer look. It was a few days before the attacks. We improvised a waltz and played newlyweds on the Pont Saint-Louis. First memory that came to mind. And a beautiful memory it is. If you say so. Keep your photo in a safe place. You will be asked for it during your experience. I'll need your signature here. An actress will leave you the message you gave us. And you'll get a laser disc to take home. No, actually... I don't want a laser disc. I just want to go home with the memory in my mind. You're a romantic, Mr. Prigent. - Not a good thing these days. - Yes it is. Ah, Marcus! This is Marcus, Mr. Prigent. Good evening. You're in very good hands. Marcus will explain the procedures to follow. I hope this will help you. We'll keep a disc anyway, just in case. Thank you for choosing us. I'm coming right down. 239! No, 238, Professor. Number 238. We've studied your story. It resonates with all of us. Dramatic events like these surpass fiction. My life is no masterpiece. What? Rest assured. Each life is worthy of a film. Okay, here we are. We've reached level minus six of the Bastille Opera. This is where we store all the sets and props used in the most prestigious shows in Paris. But! Several years before this place became a cultural landmark... Follow me. Right here, in this secret place, there was a street called Rue Josie Perron. It connected Rue Charenton to the Rue de Lyon. Thanks, Mathias. At number 86, Dr. Turrell practiced his profession with passion. He was a family doctor. Back then, this was the 1980s, Charles Turrell was married to a beautiful woman whom he adored beyond measure. They were very happy, they had a wonderful family. But then, one day, Mr. Laffont, a civil servant handling expropriations for the mayor of Paris, entered his office. But not as a patient. Marcus! Yeah, yeah! Not as a patient, but to have him to sign a document. The document stated that Paris was planning to build an opera house in this zone. As Dr. Turrell was about to sign a contract that would've given him an early and very golden retirement, a bolt of lightning struck! Mr. Laffont and Mrs. Turrell fell in love! Plunging Dr. Turrell into dark despair. Sickened by the situation, Dr. Turrell categorically refused to sell his practice, thus delaying the project. And his determination was so strong, they had to build the entire Bastille Opera around his office. From that day forward, after the trauma of losing his love, 30 years ago, Dr. Turrell began healing broken hearts. Baby, I'm begging you! Astonishing, isn't it? Are all these people actors? Background actors. Opera figurants. At night, after the opera ends, certain figurants stay behind to play the leading roles they've always dreamed of. Almost time, are you ready? - Marcus! - Yes? - This okay? - Let's see. Perfect, excellent. Hi, Sylvie. Okay for the hats, everybody? Good, very good. Let me see. Hurry, you're on in 30 seconds. The mermaid scene was excellent yesterday. There are retakes to do, I don't know why... Marcus! - You good? - Yeah, fine. I'm not sure a gladiator would say this. Not now, Oscar! "In my bed, a man wrote100 Years of Solitude. "In my arms, Mike Tyson found love again "after losing to Holyfield. "Come, my love. "Come marry me! "Don't take your flower to the grave!" Oscar, that's fabulous! I'm not so sure. Stop doubting, it's wonderful! I studied at the Comédie-Française. You did? How'd it go? The dance rehearsal? We've got to talk right now. Sorry, the dancehall musicians have a quick change for the Western. That'll be tough. How do we do it? Just so you know I'm here. Looking good, Stan! Let's go. The time has come, sir, to save the most beautiful years of your life. Let's go. Places, everyone! On your marks! Singers are warmed up and ready. All is well. Okay, roll the camera... Call it, Arnaud. File 236! Camera... and... action! Let my hands wander over your body. I'll do with you what Spring does with cherry trees. You are mine, woman of the sweet lips. My darling? What are you doing? Arthur! I'm so sorry. I no longer love you. I'm moving to the country! Has my memory begun? No. Not yet. But the time is coming. My name is Sarah. I'll be doing the cab scene with you. Thank you for playing along. I know it's a bit delicate. You're welcome. I'll need your help to get to know myself better. I mean... What do I do? Your memory will be over there. Near the exit. Okay. First I'd like to know where we met. Down by the river. It was a July 14th. We shared a beer and discussed Michael Jackson all night. Our first kiss? Rue Amelot. It was late, and... you went home to number 17. Our biggest argument? That... was on the Trocadero esplanade. We were leaving an exhibit. You thought you knew everything about that dumb photographer. We fought, and swore we'd never see each other again. My biggest flaw? You think you know everything. What do you like best? Your funny way of organizing. The time I upset you the most? You waited three days before answering my first message. The last time we saw each other? That... was November 12th. Outside the library. I wanted to go for a walk. It was cold, so you went home. The next day, you had a drink with a friend. We'd planned to sleep together. You got caught in a shooting. It was November 13th. And cut! On set, they'll give me a cell phone. I'll call and leave you the message. Perfect. Harvest Moon... You listened to it constantly. You'd dance and pretend to play harmonica. Neil Young. Is it a pretty song? Yes. Very. Every Sunday, we'd eat a Paris-Brest. We loved those pastries. We tried every bakery in the 13th arrondissement. You even kept a list for a month, in a notebook I gave you. When you'd go to the toilet, you'd run water and rustle pages so I wouldn't hear you. Meanwhile, I'd put on music so you wouldn't have to do that. We came here 2 years ago to see La Bohème. Remember? Remember? We got dressed up. You wore a red dress. I thought about making babies that night. In six months we made love all over town, savoring every spot. Rue Crémieux, Rue Mouffetard, Avenue de Choisy, a parking lot, Blvd Beaumarchais, Rue de Belleville, Buttes Chaumont. We're here now. The theme's ready, time to go. Right... If the theme's ready... It was nice meeting you. You seem like a great guy. Likewise. Action. Hi, honey. Sorry, I was too busy to call back earlier. One sec, I'm trying to catch a cab... Excuse me sir, can you drop me at République? You can? Great, thanks. I'm a big spender today, taking a cab! I'm grabbing a drink with Lisa. If I'm late, I'll slip into bed quietly. I promise.
