Hi. - How did it go? - Deathly ill as usual. - Didn't you get engaged? - There was one who was very sweet. He was only after the naughty, but it wasn't with me. A good and blessed morning, Ms. Madsen. - Did you sleep well? - Be now quiet. Too good. - Sorry. - All abandoned. Our audience is in place and waiting anxiously. Come on, miss. Madsen. In God's name. (alarm) Six seconds. Not bad. - Now you drive carefully. - Stop it. Is there gas on it? - We shouldn't lose the bonus. - More and more people we know have two cars. (bus honks) Why don't you get up an hour earlier? Jump rope, take a shower. - You have to jump until you get heart palpitations. - I don't need to jump for that. Now you must hurry. Mr. Deer has come. - Finally. I didn't think there was anyone. - We are all here. That is, Ms. Alsvig... but it probably won't last that long. Anna is late again. She's gotten in bad company, I suspect. - Karmann is very rich. - Simple fellow. Better a simple fellow with a lot of money than one without a penny in his pocket. - Calve, are you in there? - Coming soon, Mr. Hjort. You still got too much green. The ladies come and take care of the mail. It is inappropriate for you to use the ladies' changing room. It is purely for aesthetic reasons. It smells terrible inside... for gentlemen. It takes my breath away in the morning. This atmosphere of elephant house. They're late again. Mr Hjort has noted it. - Have you now put on a new coat? - Lay to you. You lay to furs like that. It is horrendous. Is it Karmann who bought it? It's probably a colored skunk. - Too bad, he has such bad taste. - So, Mr. Calve, now you must... Then maybe it was time we got started on work. Thank God. I'm just so relieved every time I see the inventory. Imagine if it was gone. - How much did you say? - 19.80. Can't you write 30 on it? There must also be some for the tax father. - Here you go, keep the rest. - Thanks. Andersen, Wulff is on his way. What should I do? Knock him down? What do you want? You must send a photographer out and take a few paintings of Karmann's house. - He was also there the day before yesterday. - It's been two days since. He will also present his new lady, who is a local find. Daughter of the working people. Bank assistant. - I understand why you were fired. - Someone from 'Look and See Gazette' is coming. What do you get for doing PR for Karmann? - Today I will have a good lunch. - Why should I do you a favor? Because you love me and know that I have something for you too. Okay, I'll send a photographer. What did I get in return? A really good Aarhus story. Hello, you. - Quist is about to go bankrupt. - Quist? It is a lie. Nope. Son of the old consul, member of the magazine's board. It can't be! - Shut up. Can you prove it? - No. But I'd bet a case of beer. The director is busy with meetings. Was there anything I could help with? Ah, yes. Good day. What do they say? Bankruptcy? Where on earth did you hear that? I can reject that. The director must apologize. I'm just a bookkeeper, - - but much has happened since the time of the old consul. Among other things, the bookkeeping has been modernized. Ah yes, but the numbers are still the same. And my numbers show me that the credit is used up. - And the share capital is... - Do you doubt that I am doing my best? No, preserved. They can shelve that story. It has nothing on it. Yes, goodbye. Yes? A couple of phones. Here you go. - Auditor Birk said it was urgent. - Was there anything else? A journalist wanted to know if we were going bankrupt. - But of course I rejected that. - Naturally. Thanks. A moment. I assume you make up your own thoughts. - Oh, yes. - What thoughts do you have then? Yesterday, I drove the wife to the airport. She was going to Switzerland. She was 60 kilos overweight, four furs and all her jewelry with her. Can I count on your discretion? The staff will not understand... - Barely. - Have we heard from Iversen? I spoke to the museum. Dr. Iversen would come home from Paris today. - Nah, already. Welcome home. - Thank you, Mrs. Hermansen. It's in there. Do you want to pay the driver and get a receit? So, so, so. You know, not here, right? I've missed you. Why don't you ever take me to Paris? My wife also asks me that. She called and said she has bridge guests if you come home. - Do you do that? - Which one? - Coming home tonight? - Now you mustn't be unreasonable, right? You know, we'll see each other on Friday as usual. No! Thank you, how sweet of you. - Has anything else happened? - Nothing special. - Director Quist has called. - He wanted to ask about his Corot. - Has Guldager been here with the frame? - Nah. - Then call him immediately. - Yes. It has been finished for a few days. I thought that Dr. Iversen ... Well, he's come home. Well, I can bring it here this morning. Yes, immediately. Goodbye. The provincial bank. Yes, just a moment. Carsten, this is for you. Carsten Calve. Yes. Yes. I'll see what I can do. Goodbye. You, him, your handsome loverboy, is he coming to pick you up today? No not today. Tomorrow. But he's coming. He has to go to the box, he said. It was there that we met for the first time. Now you probably remember that this is my department, right? You were on vacation. You cannot be left alone for a moment. I still need a week's vacation. I don't dare think about what happens next. - Where did you learn to restore? - At van Fucht's in Amsterdam. - Then you don't get a better teacher. - He was a good friend of my father. - Should I mount the picture? - No, we will arrange that ourselves. My father sold it to Consul Quist. He was very proud of that. Unfortunately, I have the picture in the lab at the moment. I have my strong doubts about the authenticity of the picture. I'm almost certain it's a good copy, but a copy nonetheless. Could father have been wrong? I'm sorry, but your father's judgments were not always equal at the end... - He drank a lot, but still. - Are you questioning my competence? Nah, preserved. Guldager, we are treating this confidentially for the time being. How much would the picture be worth today if it were real? I do not know. One and a half million, if you found the right buyer. (honks) - Good morning in the living room. Did you make it? - Almost. Have you talked to the deer? Don't worry, Mousechild. I'll fix that. ... the order of magnitude... - Relax. I'm going straight to the box. - Yes, of course. Mr Calve. Now I must be there immediately, Mr. Karmann. - Then I can handle myself. - Sorry? They don't have to stay here. They can look after your work. Don't worry. This is also my work. According to the regulations, I must be present when the box is used. But you can be quite calm. I am very discreet. For us in the banking world, nothing human is alien. Now you mustn't be sassy. I could talk to the bank manager. There is no reason to inconvenience Mr Hjort. I'm only doing my duty, but if you insist. - Can you get moving up? - No. But I can go out here at the stairs and stand with my back. I'll stop looking. (Carsten floejter "The Fate symphony") (bus honks) It's probably me. Thanks for that, Hjort. - You are welcome. May I be allowed? - Well, thank you. The quack who parked at the bus stop, is he here? - You must be sick in the head. - Now don't be so stressed, old boy. Goodbye, Mousechild. - Everything is alright. Not true? - Naturally, Ms. Hansen free. - You mustn't forget your folder. - Thanks. - Would you like to see me? - Of course, Mr. Hjort. With pleasure. - Moucechild, it's new, huh?" - Sometimes he's almost too crazy. Wonderful. You must take yourselves seriously together. Mr Karmann was very dissatisfied with your behavior. - Sorry to hear. I just followed the regulations. - They must show a little more behavior. We are a small branch, but we live in a neighborhood of significant people. - Of course. I will do my best. - I have to report to the main office. It is true. I would like to ask for the rest of my vacation. I have a week to spare. I have to have it before 1st of April. - Yes. - Yes. - It comes a bit suddenly. - That's what the holiday law says. And law is law, and law must be kept, as they say. - Not true? - Yes. Nah, nah, nah. When there is no more missing, we fill up with the cheap one. There must also be something for the tax and the wages, right? Mr. chief of police. What do one owe the honor? - I just came by. - May I offer you a drink? No thanks. It should be... They have an Italian coffee machine. I have to leave soon, but I have talented, young colleagues. And energetic. They are interested in prostitution, drug dealing, - - distribution to minors. They are doing a lot of that at the moment. - Well, that's great. - We can't have that kind of thing, can we? No, of course not. - Good, we got you into the lodge. - I am very proud and honored. It's a funny establishment you have here. Cicero. - There is also a Cicero in Aalborg. - We also have a Cicero in Esbjerg. Yes. How about Copenhagen? Said between us Jutlanders, to hell with Copenhagen. We're looking at something better. Cicero Hamburg. Yes, you see. I am also from Copenhagen. - What does it say? - 24.60. Can't you write a receipt for 40? Then there is also a little bit for the tax man, right? Here you go, keep the rest. - What did the chief of police want? - Have a cup of coffee. It was really cheap you got off. What do you want? Just to tell you there will be photographers, also from the local magazines. It is fine. See you then. - You're giving lunch, aren't you? - I have an appointment. I can handle myself, you. I'm so used to that. Holy Moley, there we have His Holiness the Cultural Pope. The very Dr. Nice in person. Thanks. Now you have made the effort with the sauce. - It looks fantastic. - Should be. It is the original you are sitting with. The copy will be delivered to you together with a statement that, - - that it is a copy, which is by no means a lie. - Will you bring the original out of the way? - Yes. I put it in my private box as agreed. I have deposited the money, we will exchange later. They are an expensive gentleman to send to Paris. Monsieur Fleischman is expensive. That's fine. Do you need to eat at Maxim's every day? - Where else? - No, it's clear. Where else? It has not been easy keeping it running. I'm looking forward to getting it all over with. So do I. I could use that fee. - DKK 100,000 for the copy. - As soon as the auction has ended. I think a million and a half is plenty for a damn picture. Considering the somewhat dirty bullets of the money... If we wait half a year, I have a client from Dallas, Texas, - - who will be willing to pay double. - I have to do my best for 10%. - That sounds really good. It looks like it should work. - Then I would like to be allowed... - Margaux 28. I thought it is only found in Quist's wine cellar. Perhaps you have also dealt with it? - There is not much left in that house. - You mustn't believe... Dear, when it comes to a Margaux 28... ... then I don't think anything at all. Messieurs. (the doer opens) Hello. Was it okay? Could you use it? - Fine. - Thank God. If I must say so myself, I was also quite talented. I was simply... good. It was a shame no one saw it. - Has he come? - If it's me, then I've come. - Then come up and set the table. - Yes. Yes. Take care of the glasses. It's the only thing I have left that has any value. (speaks Italian) - Jesus Mary, what does that mean? - I'm Neapolitan. My mom is from Cicily. We have seven bambini and I make the best spaghetti in the world. My Goodness. Yes, the Greeks. - What was it that you didn't understand? - What if it hadn't worked out? - If I hadn't been brilliant? - First of all. You're brilliant. Secondly. We wanted the key to Quist's box. I secured that a long time ago. Then we have the painting. That's a million and a half. It was also tempting to get Karmann's black money. That will be three million. Just one for each. Can't you understand it well? On such a Friday evening, one could wish to be an author. Because here we have the entire character gallery for the farce of all times. It's almost too good to be true. Here we sit. Down on Royal are the others. All of them. The bank manager talks about community spirit and civic virtue. The chief of police takes it all in. Iversen, that fool. And poor Quist. And Karmann. They have no imagination to suspect. Not at all to us. Quist knows he is there for the last time. Then he gets sentimental. - It's almost a sin. - Nothing is a sin for Quist. He only thinks about defrauding his creditors and his staff. The only thing that really dresses him is to be stripped to the skin. Iversen is the worst. He won't die until he can be stuffed. He has to go out to his mistress, whom he has installed in a house. Which he can't afford at all. Karmann is clearly not to be bear. I can't imagine him in a dress and white, that fodder master. Do you know what he calls her? Mouse child. - Mouse child? - Here they are. It's Karmann's. It's Quist's. The one with the little notch. - What is it for? - The summer house. - Are you sure about it? - Any locksmith could handle that. Here are the car keys. I will send it to you in Fredericia. Watch out for it. My dad's. It is good enough. There is little with second gear. I have sold it to a woodcutter. He'll get it on next monday. Aah god, all those mechanics. Here is my box wrench. Put it in the drawer. - The bank's key is the one with a shaft. - Do you have the equipment? Yes, in the bag. It's pretty cool. That's what I'm looking forward to the most. - Do you remember the number? - TAV398. - You're not that stupid, huh? - I'm a banker. I look forward to being free of it. Having to put all that money back every night. Deer, you can do what you want, but you must be nice to the girls. You must also be in the pictures. That's your pool. Come here. Throw away the charm cloth, so that they can see that you have hair on your chest. - Can't the lady also throw something? - It was the mostly to the house, wasn't it? We have not come to photograph furniture. - We can also go to the summer house. - Is she throwing the clothes out there? - I don't do that. - We live in the 20th century. - The Copenhageners did not take a picture. - I disclaim any responsibility when it's about ladies. You will appear in the local Sunday newspapers on the housing page. - Once upon a time PR. - I can get you on the front page. I can get good money for writing that article. But of course if you pay the same for me to let it go. It doesn't matter, even if the money is black. You have to come up with something better. It is important with the press. That is clear. We'll figure something out. There are many ways to get in the paper, right? - You have lost a box of beer. - Does it have to be right now? No, I love having money in the bank. It is of course particularly difficult for me to make this announcement - - to the company's faithful staff, - - of which so many have been here since my father's time. It is not least with them in mind that I have fought for our company, - - but there was nothing to put up against the trends on the world market. At last all means were wasted,— - and even against superior power the best fight in vain. But I can promise you that I will do my utmost to answer everyone. Everything I own will be made available. I hope to act in the spirit of my father. The captain stands on the bridge until the end. (sobs) Well, how did it go? The staff was very moved. It was almost the worst. Then there is only the auction. Yes, and then the director needs a good, long holiday. I had thought that too. I was lucky. Imagine coming to Paris for almost no money. Mother's papers must be safe. She is an actress. She is on tour. She is out with the "Dollar Princess." Thanks. That's very nice of you. Now I am putting mother down to my three shares in Varde Bank. Don't you also think it's a sensible investment? Or should I invest here? Now let's see getting done. Only I was going to Paris. But my sister always wants to go to the Kull. I'm leaving alone one day. It's only three minutes to six. We first close at six. I had the picture for examination because the frame needed to be restored. I can say with certainty that it is a fake. - A very excellent forgery, but still. - For sure? As regards French painting, no one will question my competence. Their decision means a lot to the value of the estate. As far as that is concerned, feel free to question my competence. That's very good, but how about a trip to Paris, right? - We have Paris by night. 125 francs, including champagne. - Not a crowded one. Do you know a good place? - Pigalle is around the corner. - Is it good? - It's how you take it. - I'm trying. Take care of yourself. Remember to be back before the bus goes home. Oh God. I die tomorrow at nine o'clock. Come on, miss. Soerense. (alarm) - Good morning. You are on time. Is there something wrong? - He is grumpy. Do you think I'm going to drop my pants so he can get in the paper? Shame on you. - Well, my friend, then I'll run away. - It probably lasts most of the night like usual. Yes, it will probably be the usual. Be careful not to offer yourself too much. You're not quite young anymore. Goodbye, My friend. Let it be. It's only four minutes to, and you know that Hjort... The gun is loaded. Remain calm and you will remain safe. Oh no. Do not shoot. Nothing is happening. We have instructions from the main office. (there's a knock on the door) I don't know your intentions, but neither I nor my staff will put obstacles in your way. That's what the regulations say. I could use it. - Don't you want too? There are cigars. - Yes, thank you, if that matters. Yes, under these circumstances. - Hey. - What do you want? - You owe me a box of beer. - Should it be now, it's Friday night? - All your friends are here then. - I understand why they fired him. (phone rings) Are you coming home soon? I have to... What do you say? Well, it's the bank. Yes, it's Mrs Hjort. Oh. Well, check audit. Does it absolutely have to take place at night? It does not matter. Tell him I'm going to the cinema. My sister gets upset if she doesn't hear from me. Young man, this is inhumane. They can't hold us like that. I will make myself available as a hostage if you let the ladies go. God, Mr. Hjort, you are a hero. We can't sit here without wet or dry. I appeal to you as man to man. God, look. - You could lend a hand. - Can't Mr. Hjort help? I don't want anything. I would advise against drinking liquor. God! (laughter) (laughter) Don't you want some gravad salmon? - Thanks, I won't enjoy anything! - Relax. When we're supposed to be here. They had to taste the wine. I'm getting ripped off. It is wonderful. It is unseemly. I do not understand that in these so serious... And in these such dire times for business - - it is with the deepest sympathy that we have followed that tragedy, - - that has struck brother Quist, whom we must miss in our midst. But we are proud that he held the ideals of the brotherhood high. And he must know that the brotherhood stands behind him in his most difficult hour. Precisely in such a moment you should be able to feel that you have brothers. Shall we commemorate him with a fraternity cup? (hits the gong) - Here you go. - I don't understand, they've fired him. They also regret it every morning when they get sober. Here you go. Yeah, just bring it on. Call back and you will get my conditions. A bankruptcy in Hoejbjerg Bank. Find the number. - To the police? - To the bank. They set conditions. (phone rings) Well. Listen and write down. Yes, I have. Listen right here... (the rudder is put on) They are foreigners, he talked with accent. They are four men and they have four hostages. They want two Volvos and the machine to Copenhagen at nine with full tanks. Keep the cover. You leave immediately. You two go to the bank. Find out who the hostages are. It's the staff. Call the bank manager or the finance minister. Hurry up. Also call the television. You are truly impressive. How about calling the police, huh? No reason for panic. We meet the conditions and see what happens. If we get them out of the bank, our chances are good. Keep the road covered. No one does anything without orders. It is only about money. I guess we'll have to call the master. Yes, we must. Now he has to go out and do knee bends. How does he manage at that age? Yes, hello? Yes. Hello? (police sirens) - Will we get light soon? - He's getting ready. (police sirens) Two after me. Other three onto the pavement. - Are you going to war? - You know the order. Yes, but not before I say so. - Take a sausage. - At your expense. If we make a picture, so I'm standing with the bank in the background here. Then everything is fine. The Volvos could be here at any moment. (applause) That was just what was missing. The old one in full regalia. - Joergensen, update me. - We do what they demand. The machine is ready at the airport, and the two Volvos can be here soon. How is the situation at the bank? The phone is disconnected, but apparently everything is calm. (laughter) - That's not true. - It must have been a thousand years ago. That was in 1967. Do you remember that, Hjort? Christmas lunch 67. - Around behind the filing cabinets. - Did he kiss right? - Was it good? - Can he really do such a thing? He could do both. All the Christmas games. It was very sweet. But then Joergensen came with a student and wanted the place. Oh yes. It was he who became sub-director in the main seed. Do you remember that, Hjort? You, Robber? Tell me, don't you feel hot in that mouth? He otherwise looks very sweet. Do you think he is Italian? - Italians are only up to one thing. - I could right now. Well, that's also true. So, so, girls. Now you have to be careful. Why don't you intervene? Why don't you charge in? - They have people. They have guns. - We must take the hostages into account, your own personal. - They should be shot like dogs! - Would you, please? (car horn) That one, he's Italian. - Italians, they are so naughty. - Wonderful. Arrivederci. KT to the station. The wagons are ready. We expect them out at any moment. No further orders may be entered into. KT, changing. Hello? Hello? May I ask you to listen? This is your chief of police speaking to you. We are facing the decisive moment. I must therefore ask the audience to withdraw, - - so that law enforcement can act freely. - It must be you, he means. - Thank you. Thank you. We should probably get a little closer. - It was the two of them. - They are empty-handed. - Can I pay? - Now I'll be there. Where are they? I do not know. Something is not right. Yes it is me. What are you saying? Kidnapped? - Yes, simply. - Anna? You can get a lot out of that story. It is so good that you would think you had arranged it yourself. I'm arranging a press conference. Nobody knows anything, but the one girl is engaged to Karmann. The one with the restaurants. - What's happening right now? - We are waiting for the last ones to come out. It's nice enough. It is wonderful. - Now stop, miss. Madsen. - Deer. Red deer. - Buck Bruse. - Ms. Madsen, that is indecent. - Come on, one more time. - Let's do it together. - Yes! - Now try to hear. One... No, no, no, one, two, three. And a tiny... They are sleeping. Yes, it will be DKK 10 from this morning at nine, please. Yes, please. Now this must not last any longer. The bank manager is very impatient. (laughter) Do not. See. - God! - Ms. Madsen, let it be. Big Buck Shower. Thanks for tonight. (classical music) Then it will be 3.22. There were nine. (Miss Madsen laughs) Now you must get your act together. - Now there are 27,000 too many. - Maybe we should wait. Has something been snatched? Shouldn't we try one more time? Fuck it. - Hjort? - Yes? Just a moment. I hope you have a good explanation for that. And I want it now. We do everything that is humanly possible. You count nickels. Where is Anna? What about the poor girl resident? They have had a great time. And the robbers have brought money from home. I don't think this is the time for jokes. The cash register agrees. - Karmann's summer house. Of course it looks like that. - They are sleeping. What was in the cognac? It is quite harmless, but they will be get hungover. What are you doing? It really is a very special relationship you have with ladies. They are really sweet. Her Lis there. I was getting hot behind the oars. Mouse child. Godfather be preserved. What number does that Volvo have? Yes. Where is it parked? Hoejbjergvaenge 10? Yes, and there seems to be someone in the house. Hello? Hey. Wait a minute. Let me get the walkie-talkie. We have to get hold of them at the bank. Now! - Why are they calling the newspaper and not us? - Was it Hoejbjergvaenge? (classical music) Hello? Hello? This is your police chief speaking. I urge you to surrender. The house is surrounded. All escape is impossible. (music stops) Hello in there? Can you hear me? I encourage you to drop your weapon and come out with your hands in the air. All resistance is helpless. All escape impossible. Yes, then we get up. Come on. - Shut up, what do you look like. - May I be free. What were your thoughts at this point at night? And then you want me to go to Paris in my condition. I was really good. It's a shame no one ever sees it. The Conservation Plan Committee proposes that three nature parks be laid out. The police are at the bottom of last night's big bank robbery. The car has been found, but there are no traces of hostages or robbers. The police believe that it is a kidnapping, - - as there is a connection between one of the girls and restaurateurs Karmann. The two robbers description, they are both approximately 25 years old, - - of medium height, wearing dark trousers and a black sweater. They wore dark sunglasses and spoke with foreign accents, maybe Italian. The police emphasize that the robbers can be dangerous. - Oh there you are. Did you have fun? - Was a complete holiday. - You look like that too. - I'll just get my suitcase. Here you have to see. I have found a letter. "Dear Mouse child. It's all just a joke. I'll come get you." - We are in the summer house. - What do we do now? - It's Jyllands-Gazette. - The girls are in Karmann's summer house. Whoa, wait a minute. I'm just going to... Andersen? Did you see you're in the paper today? It is a good picture. You can see how skinny you have become. That negligee is from Paris, right? What did you pay for it? Mr. Karmann has also appeared on the front page. (phone rings) Yes, hello? Yes. What do they say? The summer house? Hello? (humming) - I could stay a few days. - The phone has been removed. What? For my sake, there is no need for anyone to rush. (car horn blazing) He must have picked up speed. God knows if Andersen has remembered the police. Being in the country makes me so restless. If only I can feel like this here, then it's paradise. There he comes. - Hi. - What are you doing here? What are you up to? I can't do this. It is always the press first. We are a laughing stock for someone who wants to be on the front page. (police sirens) Yes it's good. More of that. - Is there something wrong? - Then it can probably be good. Will you take care of the young ladies? - And then I would like to talk to you. - With pleasure. I must ask you to come along. Well, finally. I also got you in the Swedish newspapers. Shut the hell up! How much of it did you arrange? I spent three hours with the police. Him Joergensen is after me. He wants to put a guard dog in here. - Then we might as well close. - Is someone about to pick on you? - It's probably her. - Who? Anna. That little skank. All the police know is that it was a girl child who bought in. It could look like... She's snarky too. She's just the type. Who else knows I call her Mouse Child? - What do you call her? - Mouse baby, damn it! - I must say. - No one else knows that. It is good enough. She can only wait. - Where did you meet her? - In the bank, of course. Oh yeah. I think we probably had a sweet story about a meeting in the box. Don't you think it's strange that nothing was stolen from that bank? They can't transfer me out of the blue like that. Well. Goodbye, My friend. I'll come home as usual. It was a terrible incident. Ms Madsen told me all. It must have been embarrassing for you. Thank you, that was kind of you. When you get time, would you help me down in the box? I'm waiting for my mother home, and then I have to get her papers home. Here you go. - Bloody hell! - Are you getting sick? A glass of water? - Can I make a phone call? - Yes, of course. Well, Mr. Quist, though. A malaise. I think it's the climate in our box room. Several of our customers have felt discomfort. Thanks. - And you want to get rid of how much? - I will ask for DKK 1,000. Wulff, journalist for the Express in Stockholm and the Daily Mirror in London. - Aha, the world press. - Was it Quist who drove from here? - He didn't look well. - I cannot comment on that. For us in the banking world, only numbers exist. But folio current account 903440 is not doing so well at the moment. What is your own impression of the events of Friday? I was on holiday in Paris. A pity when something finally happens. - What about the ladies? - They have some personal impressions. But they got the day off today because of all the emotions. They are not really lucky. It's almost a shame. You can talk to our manager Mr. Hjort. He also experienced a lot that will surely interest your readers. A moment. (there is a knock on the door) Yes? There is a journalist who would like an interview. Catalog number 371. These are two Imari dishes. They are valued at DKK 1,000. Who says 800? 600 is offered, thanks. 650 and 750. 800. There are many about it. 950. 950 and 1,000. And 1100. 1100. 1200 up here. Second time, 1200. Last time, 1200. 1300 on the third row. - Sorry? Editor Wulff, good day. - Good day. - I had expected to meet Quist. - The director has traveled to Switzerland. I thought he was going to stay for the auction. The director had to leave suddenly. - Are you the young man at Quist's? - Have we met before? I saw you the other day outside the bank. Hoejbjerg Bank. - Did Quist have a box in that bank? - I don't know anything about that. Strange. Nobody knows anything about it. - Neither bankruptcy estate nor probate. - And neither do I. One would think that you were the only one besides Quist who knew that... And there you are so wrong. Goodbye. Number 378. An oil painting, 30 x 40 in a gilt frame. There is a statement that the picture was not painted by Corot. What shall we say? A million and a half? 15,000? 1500? 500? 400, 300, 200? Has 100 been bid? 100 is offered. 150. 150 and 200. 200 by the young man. 250 in the light coat. DKK 250 and DKK 300. DKK 300 with the young man. First time, second time, last time. And that was the young man, 300. Well, congratulations on that. Damn it, too, that it's not worth more, eh? Yes, for me it is now. - Well, as a kind of memory, perhaps. - Perhaps. They are the young Guldager, right? I knew your father. It was he who sold the picture to the old consul. - I guess, he thought it was real? - Naturally. - But Iversen spoiled that. - Yes. - There's nothing to do about it. - No, there probably isn't. It is inconvenient for you to resign now. - Couldn't you imagine that...? - It's upsetting. Firing the two young ladies after all they've been through. It is not my decision. It's an order from head office. After the embarrassing publicity. As a banker, you must be able to understand... No, that's exactly it. I am deeply disappointed with the banking world as such. I don't feel that my career and my values ​​are in good hands here. I want tyo resign, I want my box emptied immediately. It's not that bad either. The world is full of banks and handsome guys. - I have never been fired before. - Oh, Mousechild. I've also quit, and I'm not at all sad about it. On the contrary. Did you hear what he called you? Mouse Child, like Karmann. - That asshole. - So he wasn't the only one. What? Do you mean that Carsten... He also went out into the elephant house. He doesn't usually do that. Oh god, is it you? - What are you doing here? - I have to ask you about that. - What are you doing in the elephant house? - There is something we want to ask you about. Mouse child. Oh God. Sorry. Well, Mr. Hjort though. - Mr. Finnigan, I suppose. - Yes it's true. Good day. I have a car outside. Did you have a pleasant trip? I am taking the picture to London for further examination. But there is no doubt that it is a genuine Corot. I don't understand how your local expert got that idea, - - that it wasn't real. Mr. Finnigan has no doubt that this is a genuine Corot, - - which can fetch one and a half million at the auction. He does not understand what is going on with the local expert Iversen. Unfortunately, I'm not buying anything at the moment. On the contrary, I hold a sale. The house has to be demolished and I leave on Thursday. Otherwise, they have been known to do quick business. And make good money on things that you get under, - - shall we call it, unconventional circumstances. How much do you think this should be worth? 50,000. - It is interesting. - Yeah, right? - Well, are you here too? - I have become unemployed. - I help Gregers close his business. - You do have some experience in that. And you may also be traveling on Thursday? Will you get rid of that figure? That gentleman values ​​it at 50,000. What do you mean? Well... Under the right circumstances, then... So what? It was found on the street. And it is worth three million or at least one and a half. It is a question of supply and demand. We used to have a clientele for that sort of thing, but unfortunately we no longer have that. God. Good day. Well, that's the world press. Well, are you also on sale? It's pretty, isn't it? Where did you find her? How much would you pay for it? Let Mr. Wulff get a favor award. Mr. Wulff writes for the newspapers in both Stockholm and London... Mr. Wulff though. Are you leaving without paying? Then we have to call the police. - Forget it. - It's one and a half million. - And I know who has them. - I have the police on my back. They have also put the customs on me. If they come with the tax authorities, I'll smoke in. Then forget it. - What do I get for it? - For what? To forget it. In my industry, you live on information. Either by selling them or by forgetting them. You little bed bug. I have to live too. And preferably a little good. Do you know what to do with that information? Stick them up straight! The million and a half do not exist. I don't know anything about them. And by the way, I'm pretty tired of you. Next time, it's a beatdown. - Are we going in the water now? - No, Mousechild. I do not have time. There must be a bounty, right? Since no report has been made, there are no bounty. But if the story fits… It is about DKK three million. The one and a half million is the painting. The two young guys have the other million and a half in cash. - You must ask for an explanation of that. - Is it Karmann's black money? - That's the interesting thing. - Yeah, right? But if the story doesn't fit, then we'll be laughed at again. - And that's the uninteresting part. - It fits. I'm bombproof. - When are they leaving? - On Thursday from Billund. - What about the one bounty? - It is the citizen's duty. - There must be an account for this sort of thing. - On a special occasion the police chief could... How much would it then turn out to be, approximately? Approximately DKK 1,000, if it goes high. It will be just DKK 350. A receipt? 350? That was a lot, huh? Can't you wait for me? I have to go back anyway. They are there. Bless you. - No hand luggage? Here you go. - Thank you. Good day. We have security checks. May we see your luggage? They just have to go in right here. Hello, you. Here is your luggage. No. Thanks. Here you go. - Stop her. - You there. Hello? Just a moment. (cry) - Is there anything? - No. It was hell. It is not forbidden to have personality. - Tell me how on earth... - Wasn't I good? Good, you got a chance to see how good I am. - Stop it. Where is the money? - They have been here for a few hours. But I had to invite a few friends along. Voila. You have to find yourself in it, because they know it all. Surely it is just, - - that three handsome, young guys experience happiness. But what is happiness worth if you have no one to share it with? God. No, have you seen? There we have the pilot. What do you give me? Then we'll be leaving soon. Last call, Sterling Airways route 197 to Paris. Please get on board. Well, shall we see how to get home again? - It's going to be difficult with... - You don't have to think about the payment. A young lady came and offered me DKK 1,000 to drive you back home. She said I should keep the rest. Yes, you will get your receipt to the taxman. I have to say that. After all, it's just before the cashier fits. --- Subtitles by Essery.---
