In 1946, the American judiciary made a gift to the Mafia. He deported Salvatore Lucania to his native Italy . aka Charles Lucky Luciano, the gangster king of New York. Accused and sentenced to 50 years in prison in 1936, but prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey, After only nine years in prison he was released on parole "Special Services to the U.S. Army During World War II." The same Mr. Dewey became Governor of New York. NEW YORK FEBRUARY 11, 1946 Open the gates! Nobody goes to the pier! - Why? - Who else are you? People work here! Someone could be injured. And we don't want accidents, people. - We take responsibility. "I said no one was climbing!" - Luciano agreed to give us an interview. - Immigration made the arrangements. Mr. Luciano does not want to be disturbed. He doesn't receive anyone. Follow me! Open the gate! Where are you going, Mac? I take them to Luciano. I'm from the Immigration Department. I don't care where you are from! Nobody climbs the dam. Back! Not even a poor picture? I tell you for your own good. Go home! Listen to me and leave now. Come on, boys, it wasn't the Immigrants who stopped you from boarding the ship! Yes, we know who orders here! Mr Luciano called on the US government to resign . Damn Italian! 15 aprilie, 1931, Conney Island, New York Then, soon. Excuse me, I'm going to the bathroom. - Where have you been? - I was washing my hands. Take pictures of everyone. And where have you been? I had to go to the bathroom. I was washing my hands. I heard gunshots and ran away, but no one was around. My friend Joe Masseria was already dead. He was in a good mood ... I had just eaten spaghetti with seafood. Whoever did this will pay. He was like a father to me. I loved him like a father. Albert Anastasia, from the Ministry of Justice. He is guilty of at least 50 executions, but there is no evidence. - I don't have a movie anymore. Who's the guy? - It's Meyer Lansky ... The brain. What the hell are you doing with all this? "I'm kicking you in the ass!" - Do you like the guy? He's a bastard! Charlie, leave him alone! Freddie and us! Here's Franck Costello, the prime minister. ªi pe Sox Lanza ªeful de la "Fulton Fish Market"! Wouldn't it be great to raise all these bastards? We freeze our eggs and they party! Bastards! Let's drink for Italy! ªampanie! Sã vinã ºampania! Charlie, they're drinking champagne and you're drinking a poor Coca-Cola! No bastards! You do not lead a country if you do not have power. Because the only way to keep order it is to make the world the way we want it to be. A man, in order to be a man, must make order between men. And if you make order, you make peace. Five months after the removal of Joe Masseria, on the night of September 11, 1931, known as the "night of the Sicilian wasps", 40 other mob leaders from all over the United States were killed. The strategist for beheading the old Mafia was Lucky Luciano, which thus becomes the "Head of the Heads." Bitter, red Sicily of so much shed blood So much so, since I was a little boy Alone and sad all over the world. Mother, your death It broke my heart. But you, my homeland, shouldn't leave me, Hold me in your arms, like my mother. " Friends, I want to thank everyone. I was once a free citizen of America. Now I am a free citizen of Italy, Although, I'm not going to stay here long. Even if I have to go through Mexico. I advise you not to wait another nine years. Forget your $ 200,000. If you still need it, say so. - Who the hell is that? - What the hell do you want?! Don't get mad, Alberto. It's a party between friends. Come in, come in ... - Drink a glass too. - I'm sorry, I'm on duty, I can't drink. - What service? You're at a party. - I'm sorry, I can't drink. - But you're Italian! - Yes, I'm Italian. Pour this peasant a drink! I am not a peasant, my parents were born in Altavilla Irpina, a province of Avellino. May I help you? Should I stop by your family in Italy? I can visit them. What else can I do for you? Do you want to be promoted? Yes, a promotion ... But how can you help me if you were deported to Italy? Don't worry. That's my job. I have my men in Washington. Let's hope so. Lercara Friddi, Sicily, the place where, on November 11, 1897, Lucky Luciano was born as Salvatore Lucania. Forgive me, Excellency, but it was a little late. I know, it's no problem. "Did he come to see the country where he was born?" - Yes. He's the third boy they killed. CANCEMI GIUSEPPE, innocent victim of a vengeful hand. RUSSO ANTONIO, killed by the hand of sin, weeping for his uncomforted wife. Here lies GIARDINA ANTONINO, who dedicated his life to his fellow workers and to the cause of socialism. The mortal remains of NICOSIA CARMELO, innocent victim of a ruthless murderer. ANGELO PALIZZOLO, brutally killed by an unknown hand. Here lies, resting forever, VITO SALVATORE, victim of a tragic and inevitable destiny. PULEO SALVATORE, killed in his prime by an infamous assassin. Are you Lucky Luciano? NAPLES - I'd like some spaghetti "a la marinara". - Isn't the Lord Italian? - Are you American? - Yes. Vã place Neapole? It's too early to tell. Spaghetti for the American! United Nations, 1952 International Conference on Drug Trafficking A fleet of fishing vessels , merchant ships and yachts, leaves Marseilles and Sicily, spreading the Mediterranean from Tangier to Beirut, from Malta to Genoa and Trieste, I call the command of a great mobster. "A calm man with sad eyes," who lives undisturbed in Naples, Lucky Luciano. In a few years, He created the largest criminal organization in existence. Our investigations in Italy, made in spite of the skepticism and indifference of the Italian police, They prove that the drug mafia destined for the US market receives a large part of heroin from reputable distributors in Italy. I calculated that only The Schiaparelli Company of Turin, alone, over 350 pounds of heroin on the illicit drug market. I asked the Italian Public Health Commission to intervene And stop the illegal sale of licenses. - But he didn't do anything. - Not true! I arrested Migliardi, the director of the Schiaparelli Company. I sentenced him to 11 years in prison. But nothing has changed. Luciano and his people continued to buy drugs from all these companies! Italian researchers and medical authorities insist that heroin, Properly administered, it is beneficial in many diseases. Send these researchers to America. We'll show them how well heroin works! What can I know about Italy? Let's look at the facts. The great chemical industries in Italy they have ties to political power and the government in Rome. Explain that. Like all these mobsters, actually real gangsters Do I receive passports and gun permits without any problems ? Why in the Italian police records are registered as "well-oriented politically and civilians with a good moral character"? Why not ask these questions to the US Immigration Bureau and the US Department of Justice? Who sent these gangsters and mobsters to us in Italy? You Americans! And you sent hundreds. You called them "undesirable strangers." These "undesirables" landed in Sicily, behind the Allied Armies. then they went to Naples, Milan and Genoa. Always behind the US military. Ask your generals why they have appointed mayors in the Sicilian cities liberated people like Calogero Vizzini sau Genco Russo. People known as the dreaded Mafia bosses. Ask Colonel Charles Poletti, then in Naples, why did you choose Vito Genovese as your collaborator ? Didn't you know just as well that Vito Genovese is a great Mafia boss? American Army Officers Club Naples, 1944 We found this town a little like garbage, but we'll leave it smelling like a rose. I searched the ruins for a breath of fresh air and restored self-respect to the Italians. Quiet! Greet Colonel! You have to understand the psychology of Italians. In order to conquer them, I had to convince them that the war was over. For that I had to bomb shelters, to show them that the war is over there too. It's a psychology problem. Am I right or not? Of course you're right ... You need to know exactly what you are doing and who you are dealing with. But this is not all. We must always have full bellies. I've always heard people say, "Fewer words and more spaghetti." They are right. After all, why are we fighting? Because we have everything and they have nothing. But we give them cigarettes, food, gas and jobs. After all, that means freedom. I'm right? You're right. Jim, I don't like your boyfriend. Can you get me another one tomorrow? My boyfriend will bruise my eyes if he sees me again with an American. Don't worry, they're drunk. I'm not capable of anything. What would I not do for a canned beef! You see, this is a big responsibility. Everything that comes to Naples must reach the people. Not to scammers and speculators! I made only one mistake in Sicily, dear Genovese! We were too good. You're right. - That's it, that's it, we're done! - You're right. We don't care if it's about princes, cardinals ... Vito, you have to tell them to cooperate and stop the black market. If I don't, I won't feel sorry for you! Tell them, Vito! Am I right, gentlemen? - Yes... If you do not speak loudly, they will not listen to you. The colonel wants everyone to know that he must cooperate to end the thefts and the black market. The punishments will be very, very severe. Severe and strict rationalization will ensure correctness distributing aid to the American people to the Italian people. Trãiascã America! Trãiascã ltalia! There are five tons of wheat And 4-ooo liters of olive oil. Look, "the mayor is authorized to transport the purchase and sale of oil and wheat." - And look, "He won't be requisitioned." - We'll need about 12 trucks. Say what you need and receive. But be careful with the drivers. They are all black and they also drink gas from the tank. Let's see them too! This is the gasoline permit. No name, no quantity. As much as you want! Very good. We should unload at San Giuseppe, the city ​​is full of military police. After unloading, burn the trucks. Let's not leave any traces. Let him go! Turns! Stop! - You like? - You can tell. Mike, you have to give me a Packard, or we won't do business. Okay, take it! I came from New York in a Buick. It's yours! Hey, what do we do with these blacks? Sell ​​them with their clothes. Are you ashamed in front of the Americans? Get out of here! Fantastic! I would like one too. - You dont want? - Good morning, Colonel. Hi ... this beautiful blonde, right? It's the first Packard in Italy. - Seriously? - Do you want to try it? "You mean it's yours?" - Let's take a walk. Let's go! So which one is yours? This is like you ... No ... like that. We need a new magistrate and a new president of the Bank of Naples. Of course. We have many requests, everyone wants to go into business, but don't worry. I made a list of anti-fascists, And true friends of the Americans, for whom I guarantee. I still need permits to bring oil, gas and everything else. But the real problem is the plant that supplies electricity to the factories. Those who need to pay, right? Russia is not here, we do not give for free. - Am I right, Colonel? - Yes. Do you like the car? Keep it. Who gave Lucky Luciano the document to testify its public utility. According to this document, It seems that he was the person who "He served in the United States military ." You released him from prison. Basically, you gave him a medal! Don't forget the help I gave you through the Marshall Plan! Your statement is blackmail. Don't help the people! And socialist morphine arrives in the United States. The Yugoslavs stop the Italian traffickers with their small fishing vessels when they enter their territorial waters. But you.. Why didn't you notice a whale fishing vessel belonging to him? Mr. Rosario Mancino, of Palermo, who anchors on the Dalmatian coast every week ?! Ia loc, Charlie. There is no point in trying to blame the Italians. The games are not played in Rome or Naples ... ci la New York ºi la Washington. What do you mean, Mr. Anslinger? They started a campaign against us. As you follow Luciano through Italy, they were trying to discredit the Narcotics Bureau. I always say that we are paranoid, megalomaniacs, that we arrest people without evidence. And that I made up the story with Luciano and drugs for political reasons. The sincere fairy tale invented was the one with Luciano winning the war in Sicily. From the Kefauver file, you'd think people knew the result. Democrats say Mr. Dewey made it possible for drugs to enter the United States when he released Luciano. Mr. Dewey does not like to refer to Luciano, or to his return. Now that the Republicans are back in power, Dewey has very strong friends. The Attorney General, for example, And ... And the Minister of Finance, and that to give up other names. - And who do we have? - We have each other, Charlie. Take care. Dewey forms his own commission to "investigate the Lucky Luciano case." That's what they say. He's trying to prove that everything the Kefauver commission said was a lie. And that we have no evidence against Luciano regarding his work in Italy. So Licky is the hero and we bastards. Who will believe that? Judges! The same judges. I'm still in office. Those named by Frank Costello when he, Meyer Lasky Luciano was still pulling the strings in New York. But now the Republicans are in power ... The Mafia does not differentiate between parties. The Mafia has no party. It is on the side of those in power. In Truman's day, they supported Truman, and Dewey fought them. Now Dewey is in power and Kefauver is fighting them. - And where are we? - In the middle. And if we don't care, we collect it from both sides. What are we doing now? We continue to follow Luciano ... Dewey will continue to pursue us ... And Kefauver will continue to pursue Dewey. When the tracking is complete, everyone will wake up at the starting point and everything will be as it was at the beginning. Oh, Charlie, Charlie... Not all of them. Not Charles Lucky Luciano. - Give me Gene Giannini's file, please. - Immediately, sir. Thanks, that's all. EUGENE GIANNINI, SAID THE GENE PELLEGRINO Homicide, armed robbery, drug trafficking. NAPLES Gentlemen, Lucky Luciano is speaking. - I'm here. What do you want to know? - Where have you been all this time? "How did you escape Italy?" - Who issued your passport? "How impatient! Slow down, one at a time, please." Is it true that you control casinos in Cuba? Let's sit at the table. We also have soft drinks. Mr. Lucania, you know that in the UN investigations you were involved in drug trafficking. They talk about you and the Narcotics Department! Ask Henry Asslinger! Anslincker! Harry Anslincker, Head of the Narcotics Department. Asslincker! A German, a Protestant and a policeman. If a crook is killed, Luciands is to blame. If the Queen of England cheats on her husband, it 's Luciano's fault. If you go to a party, Does that mean you sell ... How do you say in Italian ... "narcotics"? Luciano is also to blame! For them, Lucky Luciano and drugs are about the same thing. I don't take anything. Yes, but this scandal appears in all the newspapers, Mr. Lucania. What about the discussions in Congress and the United States Senate ?! Everything is political! In America, if you want to elect a president who is now Dewey, a Republican, a fair man by the way, all Democrats I say everywhere that if it weren't for him, he would still be in prison. Weren't you released "for military service"? Is it true that in 1943, you were parachuted to prepare for the "invasion"? I have never seen Sicily from above. And I never liked airplanes. I like to go to Sicily, but only by boat to Palermo! - I have a candy factory there. - Yes, for chocolate. Do you like confetti? - And bathed in the sun, like Capri! - And smuggling? Since your return, Sicily has become the focal point of cigarette smuggling. watch, "cigarettes of the monopoly"! I think I'm the only one in Naples who doesn't smoke smuggled cigarettes. What do you smoke? See, they have no evidence against me. If there was any evidence, I would go to jail! Why don't I ask for my extradition to the United States? I would be the first to return, even in handcuffs! "But I can defend myself." - Even in handcuffs? Would you like to return to America? You were just born in Italy! I came to America as a child, I lived there for 30 years as a free man. I was imprisoned after false testimonies from bitches who wanted to harm me. No rules were followed! But here in Italy ... I am persecuted. There is no rule. here... Here ... I don't even know what a bail is! - But in the age of prohibition ... - Prohibition! An invention of the Jesuit Asslinker! The people wanted to drink. And someone had to give him a drink! If it weren't for us, what could the government do? So you have provided a public service! Yes, I did a service to society. That's why we all supported Delano Roosevelt. He knew that many things needed to change. "That's why we gave him our vote in Chicago." - Do you like to do politics, then? But why not in Italy? Because it's a poor country. How to do politics without business? Mr. Lucania, is your business in Italy doing badly? With the factory in Palermo alone, I lost about $ 10,000. So how do you manage to live? Spend a lot of money and lose huge amounts of money in racing. I explained this to Finance. Fortunately, I get help from my friends in New York. Even the car is a gift from them. I'm not a rich man! What do you tell us about living expenses, bodyguards? Which bodyguards? The police don't weaken me for a minute! Of course, you always travel between Rome, Milan ... - You even have a passport. "You're going abroad!" I am a free man! The US government has nothing to do with me! Every time I go to Capri, I am supervised by Interpol. - Take care of my security. "You mean someone like you," like Lucky Luciano, can he go where he wants to America? I want to go back to America with my head held high! I have to go back there! And for when I die ... I bought a family chapel in Brooklyn Cemetery. Well ... welcome to Genoa, Countess. Get in... Charlie, you damn bastard! Get in! Come in, come in, take a seat! Sit down. Where the hell do you want me to stay? The trouble with you is that you're a stupid cop! You should do as I do, I can travel anywhere. I have money ... look at this ring! Do you know what I can do with him? Put it in your ass! You'd love to, wouldn't you? See this? It's the bottom of a countess. Have you ever shot a countess? In Italy there are counties on all roads. I don't like bitches either. Slut? Did you make me a bitch? You bastard! Talk like two fools! Take off your hat in front of a lady, sir! Do you know anything else? - What the? - Screw you! - What a waste! "Well, the nuns learned it!" Where the hell did you find this bitch? She may be a bitch, but she's great in bed! Do you know I like you, Charlie? Both of us... We should do business together. I will help you at the beginning, I guarantee you will thank me. Well done, maybe I'll end up like you, in prison or in a dumpster full of holes. No, that doesn't happen to me. Of course not, because we are defending you. But you better be careful at every step. We know you're a drug courier. We even know what rubbish you're talking about. Sure. Of course you know. Where do you think I get the information from? Luck! In the meantime, you do your own business and you give us the crumbs. Better than nothing, isn't it? Giannini, I've heard enough of your nonsense about Turks and Arabs. But when I want to talk about Lucky Luciano, you don't know anything. Only shit! What do you mean "shit"? No one has been found to scare me yet! Who told you that Luciano won $ 50,000 in Naples? I! Yes, he paid $ 4,000 and came out of court laughing. Good job! Is it my fault? Leave me alone. Let me act as I believe in Italy and France and show you what Giannini can do! Listen to me now! I know you sell penicillin, but I don't care. The Italians don't care either. But now it's about fake dollars. This is ruined by Italian tourism business. - And one more thing! - What the? - You know very well what I want from you. - What do you want? Lucky Luciano! Good. He just came in. - Can you help me find Lucky Luciano? - Yes, sir. There ... it's there. Fuck you, Lucky! Hey, Charlie! Of Luciano, contention ... - Igea, this is Mr. Giannini. - Pleased. "Does he want to get some rest?" - Not. - Sure? - Sure. One moment! Take the suitcases to my room. I'll take the camera. I will take some wonderful photos! I will drive, you have forgotten the streets of Naples! My mother, how dirty Naples is! Lucky, will we have to organize the trash like we did in New York? Do you remember Tony Strollo? This ticãlos! What a dirty city. How can you live here? Do you know what you should do? You should come with me, I could go to Paris or the Riviera. I talked to your friends in Marseille. Do we do business with penicillin or not? Come here! Come see this, honey! See what it is? Looks like me! He pointed the shorter way to the brothel. - The house with bitches? - Yes, the bitch house, do you want to see? - Always! - This way ... it's a shortcut ... This way, sir. Poftiþi ... Come in, please. This is a brothel, the oldest house of pleasure in the world. The Romans were very intelligent. Pompeii was a cosmopolitan city, And not everyone spoke Latin. Many visitors did not ask but looked at the frescoes to choose what they wanted, And then they went to the desired room frescoes representing different positions of love. The first three positions are normal First, a woman above the man. "candle snuffer". The second, somewhat more unusual, is the Spanish position. What is the Spanish position? A woman has one foot on the man's shoulder. No, the woman's legs are around the man's shoulders. The third is a little different. The woman in front, and the man behind the woman, is the position of the dog. In front was the cashier selling the tickets. And now the two numbers that need no comment. - First of all, position 69. - 69! I've heard of this before! And second, it's against nature. Fags! Fags! - In English, sodomy. - Yes, sodomy, see with your own eyes. The last fresco is on the left and is the most unusual. But why does he have two? How come? What do you want me to tell you? I wasn't there. Maybe he used one at night and the other at night. Lucky! He solved his problems! Notice this beautiful parsley, surrounded by a portico, which made it possible to walk on rainy days, It allowed light to enter the rooms In this room the master of the house took an afternoon nap. How long did he take a nap? Two, three or four hours ... Maybe more or less. - Slaves did the housework and the master slept. "How many slaves were there?" - Maybe 20. - 20! Hell, what a life! It wouldn't be too bad if you were the master, would it? And now, continuing along the alley, we turn right and before the end of the visit, We will see another room with other wonderful erotic frescoes ... Very well preserved erotic frescoes. Lucky! Do you want to move to Marseille? Is that what you decided? You know I don't like to travel. In America, where did I go? From time to time in Florida on winter vacation. Only in resorts. Even here I like to be as close to Naples as possible. Sometimes I go to Sicily. In my hometown. Or in Milan. For horse racing. We could make a lot of money in Marseilles. Usually, friends visit me for pleasure. They don't come to find work ... It's just that you're a tourist. I'm sorry, Mr Giannini, but we have an arrest warrant in your name. - This is a joke? - No, I'm not kidding. This accurately acuza precisie you. - Smuggling. - How? Bani falºi. Bani falºi? You can't arrest me! I'm an American citizen. - Here we are in Italy. - I don't care, I'll make a call ... Call later! Please take a seat. I said take a seat. "I've been lying in this stinking prison for three months , with no windows, just bars." "I have no air and no light. It's hot and the mosquitoes eat me alive." "There are six here and if we have natural needs we do them all here." "I'm like a landfill, day and night." "I don't even have time to go back and sleep one has to stay awake to protect us from rats, who are hungry and big enough to attack us. " "Lice are as big as beetles." "I have to pay to have some water and some straw on the bed." "It cost me $ 50 to send this letter." "Yours, etc, etc ..." In Italy you are born poor. This is another letter from Gene. This is about you. About Joe Picci and Frank Calace. The letter could ruin you. He was supposed to get to Charlie Syracuse, but I'll give it to you. You have to trust me! Come on, break it! Did you have to give it to Syracuse? All right, give it to her. Do you want me to take you? Gene! Everything is OK? Everything is perfect. You let me rot for a year in this prison! Come on, Gene, I want to talk to you. Get in the car, I want to talk. I got you out of jail and got you out of court. If you got in front of the judge, you wouldn't escape. For your part, I could die there. But you could take me out whenever you wanted. Let one thing fit in your head. You were in the hands of the Italian police. They don't take orders from me, an American cop. - I had to invent something to get you out. - And who invented history when I walked in? It's not my fault. You insisted on bragging about the fake money. Who told them at the border that I had counterfeit money? Probably one of your good friends. Maybe even Lucky Luciano! No, no, Lucky isn't talking. Lucky is a man, not ... a caster. And what the hell are you? Neither a policeman nor a man. You're just a caster! Okay, I'm not a cop, I'm a caster! if so, why the hell don't you leave me alone ?! - This passport is worth it. - How? You're making a trip to New York. We bear the expenses. - La New York? - Exact. Why? To testify before the Grand Jury. Not! No, no, no ... Stop the evil! I'm coming down here! Use your mind, Gene. If you stay here without an Italian passport, you may be declared undesirable. And if I go to New York, they'll kill me! I tried to save your ass, but you talked too much. How could I talk? I spent a year in prison. Who was I talking to? - You had a bad habit of writing letters. - The only writings were for you. "What did you do with the letters?" - I'm with you. But I told you not to trust the countess. I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to scare me into doing anything ... But I'm not going to New York! I will stay here in Italy! And I tell you that you will not stay in Italy. I know everything you've done, and it's better for you not to say it. Get your passport and ticket to New York. The plane leaves in an hour and you will be in it! I don't know who a bigger bastard is, you or Luciano. In early September, 1952, Gene Giannini returns from a trip to Italy, where he had served ten months in prison. Tony Bender summoned me for the most important contract so far with Cosa Nostra. He invited me to dinner at "Rocco's" on Thompson Street in Greenwich Village. For a while we talked about one, the other ... then we went into business. "Gene spoke at the Narcotics Department, " he told me. "Vito Genovese found out from Lucky Luciano." Lucky said Giannini has been pouring into Narcotics for years. It had to be finished. He and all who are with him. I phoned Gene and told him to wait for me at the Casbah bar. I claimed he owed me some money. I went on a date with Joe Pagano. He was a new guy and Gene didn't know him. But he was an ace of the gun Giannini told me that he was a lefter and that he had nowhere to give me the money. "Leave that alone and let's have fun." I told him. I called a girl at the bar. They drank a few payments together and I left him with the girl. The next night I took Pagano and two other boys And we went to the casino where Gene Giannini worked. I explained the plan to them. One of the boys had to wait in the car a block away. The other two had to wait for Gene at the door. I told them to drop the guns in the East River. I asked Bender to tell Vito Genovese, that Gene Giannini will no longer bother him at the Narcotics Department. Lucky Luciano could be reassured. Do you want to play with me? Thanks, I'd rather play alone. Stay! - What the hell are you doing? - Just a word. Paris Interpol Headquarters I'll tell you what Lucky Luciano was doing at the horse races in Naples. This is his office, you understand? From here he controlled the sale of drugs. Lucky was the brains of the organization. He is the king who sat on the throne. His people in New York gave him a meeting at the horse races in Naples. He introduced them to the Sicilian mobsters, Corsican suppliers and lots. But he is never present when the delivery is made. He takes his side harder. From both buyers and suppliers. The money is sent to a Swiss bank, on behalf of Lucky Luciano. Okay, Charlie. But what did that slap mean? Nothing! It has nothing to do with smuggling or heroin trafficking. It's just a big attempt at Luciano's expense, that's all. We know he has his men. We know they're criminals. We know all this. But I want to say something else. It is about a man who almost never leaves Naples. He gets up early, walks his dog, and later, maybe, goes racing ... Now that you've said that, we're going to have to ban him from racing ... He's nice to everyone ... He gives money to charity, is friends with journalists and sometimes with the police. When I mentioned his past, a local police inspector told me, "Yes, yes, of course we know, it was closed ... because he sent girls to prostitution. But what kind of crime is this? " "A girl prostitutes herself because she 's rotten, a bitch." "And we can't arrest a man for a murder 20 years ago." - "And this crime was not committed in Italy ..." - Sure, but ... If what you say is true, he is truly an exceptional man. One thing's for sure, After Luciano's arrival in Italy, the Mafia took control of drug trafficking. It is said that more than 100 million dollars are extracted from this business . But why can't we arrest Lucky Luciano? The answer is very simple. Do not risk unless strictly necessary. He is a lonely man. So the police can't really charge him with anything. A stranger smells from a mile away. This Sicilian bastard embodies the Mafia's power and ability to corrupt. But hundreds and thousands of decent Sicilians he must pay for his sins. That's why I hate the Mafia! That's why I want to give Lucky Luciano a moment of peace! PALERMO, 1957 HOTELUL DELLE PALME From the file of the parliamentary commission that was to investigate the Mafia phenomenon in Sicily. In October 1957, in the city of Palermo, A series of meetings took place between the Italian-Americans and the Sicilian mobsters. It was chaired by Lucky Luciano. And the purpose of the meetings was to create a center in Sicily for the entire transit of drugs to North America. Giuseppe Bonanno, alias Joe Banana, born in Sicily, currently an American citizen and head of the "family" in New York, went to Palermo to coordinate and unify the interests of Cosa Nostra with those of the Sicilian Mafia, to prepare the meeting that was to take place in a few months in the Appalachian Mountains of New York State. In his presence, Giuseppe Genco Russo, the recognized head of the Sicilian mafia, The meeting in Palermo was a guarantee of the pact of unity And obedience in the Mafia hierarchy. Nine years later, 17 alleged mafia bosses, were brought before the judge and accused of forming a criminal association, but only five were convicted. Cami / lo Guarantor, Giuseppe Scandariato, Giuseppe Genco Russo, John Bonventri, ºi Joe Banana. I would like to propose a toast in honor of our good friend, Lucky Luciano! Even though you are far from home, you are always present in our hearts. One hundred years of health! Governor Thomas E Dewey is coordinating the meeting on organized crime Do you refuse to answer? You've been asking me the same question for five hours. I give you the same answer. Are you a witness or a defendant? Governor Dewey has set up a commission to investigate the release of Lucky Luciano. Aren't you the expert on Luciano's case? I work as an agent in the Narcotics Department. I am investigating drug trafficking in Europe. Everything I know about Luciano is in the regular report my superior, Harry J. Anslinger. Ask him for the Washington reports. You testified before the Kefauver commission that Luciano is the king of narcotics ... I said that if he weren't a king, he would be at least a member of the royal house. And where is the evidence? I told you before. It's very difficult to have evidence against Luciano. But behind every detainee, Joe Picci, Frank Calace, Frank Coppola, we discover his shadow. All those caught with stained hands, they turn out to be Luciano's associates. What do you mean, "associates"? It always means when I catch someone he invariably had ties to Luciano. - In the case of Joe Biondo ... - Then it was just acetic anhydride. Just? Acetic anhydride is used to turn morphine into heroin. Luciano was not charged in Italy with drug trafficking. That proves they have nothing against him. No, that proves his accomplices don't want to name him maybe out of respect or fear. But our informants told us that Luciano is always the supplier. - Even Giannini ... - Giannini is dead! And it's not yet clear why he died. If he stayed in Italy, he would be alive. Why did you force him to return to America? I didn't force him! I bought him a ticket and accompanied him to the airport. Do you want to accuse me of Giannini's death? We have to research everything. It doesn't hurt a cop to see the other side. Yes, it would be a good experience for a judge, even for a governor. Why don't we investigate the reasons why Luciano was released and deported to Italy? I have the documents here. And the report from your colleague, Agent White. As usual, you rely on gossip and insinuations from gangsters who are then killed. White's informant is dead. But Dewey's assistants who went to Luciano's prison are still alive. "I can tell you what they told me." "And exactly?" That Luciano had no information to help the US Navy. He offered only one check for Governor Dewey's political campaign. Do you want to be tried for perjury? Don't scare me, I'm telling the truth. I care little about politics. It's not about politics when you blame Luciano for your inefficiency And the failure of the Narcotics Department to stop drug trafficking? It's easy to accuse! I'm convinced Luciano is the traffic chief. And I'll catch him one day! Give us the evidence. Prove it and we'll ask for his extradition. Since the Italian court does not request his arrest, They will be happy to send him to America, where he will be charged. He was imprisoned in the United States. He had to stay in prison. Kids, let me through! Didn't you come in? Didn't you listen to the job? I listened to her from here. Inside, I wouldn't have been careful. I want to understand what trouble the priest is having. Did you see ... It's like I saw him. Don Ciccio, you have me. Why are you asking me now ... And after Igea's death ... I need people like you by my side. Listen, Lucky, with the charities and the hospital expenses, I did debt. Some friends want to bring me some German cars. Of those that are put at the bar! I say you put in 100 pounds and take out 1,000. Or 5,000. What do you say? Don Ciccio, I've seen toys like this in America. Leave the cars ... Nobody steals from you. This is the first time in so many years that we have faced Lucky Luciano. - And right now I'm giving myself another mission. - Why? What is the reason? It seems that some people upstairs in Washington are afraid that they are digging too deep. Isn't it disgusting that American sailors ask this mobster for autographs? 350 kilograms of heroin were seized by the Italian police and the narcotics department 40 arrests made in Italy and the United States. Naples January 26, 1962 Who is? The mobile team! Open! Immediate. - Is Salvatore Lucania here? - She's in bed. Tell him we need to talk. Join ... Waiting for you. Good evening. We need to do a search. - Is the young man with you? - Yes, he's our agent. Can I give you a whiskey? Do you want a drink? No, we are not allowed during the service. Then look for ... Do you want to see if I can find something? What is this? I have a permit What's your name? I'm Corporal Schioppa. You are an intelligent person. I'll take this telegram. If you want... You have to come too. The captain wants to interrogate you. At this time? Yes, at this hour. Well, are you telling us how to interpret this telegram? I told you once. "What else do you want me to tell you?" - I want to hear from you again. Let's read it again aloud ... "My only contact with the American writer, Martin Goesh, now a resident of Madrid, It was simply to prepare a script based on my life. " "Martin Goesh sent me a telegram telling me that he was coming to Naples today to return the manuscript to me. " "Although the idea for the screenplay was mine, I gave it up." Do you remember what was written here? Okay ... what did you do yesterday after you received the telegram? Ask him! He hasn't been away from me all day. Maybe he forgot something, you better tell us. Tell us one more time. "On the 25th, this month, at 13:00, I went to the" California "restaurant on Via Santa Lucia, where I ate with my friend Giuseppe De Meris, who now lives in Naples. " "He was forced to leave Cuba, where he was a croupier." "While I was eating, my friend Gigi Lombardi appeared , called 'Cico', who has a club in Taormina." "The aforementioned" Gigi " recently returned from Spain, where he was together with Mr. and Mrs. Lamarco of Miami. " Your friends travel a lot! And what a coincidence ... You realized that tourism between the United States, Naples and Sicily Did it flourish after you settled in Naples? And bullfighting has become a new attraction. From Cuba, from Taonnina, from Miami ... everyone passes through Spain, after which, everyone comes to see you in Naples ... Then they return without rushing to New York. It's a complete tour, isn't it? If you say so... You say it was around 2:00 when you left Gigi at the California restaurant. "He was preparing to return to Sicily by car, and you took him to the horse races." "At the racecourse I saw my friend Pasquale Eboli, zis ºi "Pat Ryan"." Eboli lives in Scisciano ... a village... Close to Naples. Just half an hour. And the next day he's in Spain making a movie. And he calls "Pat Ryan," who is also an actor. I did not believe Syracuse when he said that cinema and drugs go hand in hand. Syracuse is a bou! Siragusa cares about you. He only has nice words about you. Syracuse is a bou! You can tell him that. Syracuse does what you want. He speaks and acts as you call him. I haven't had peace in ten years since you've been in Italy ! If Syracuse is a Sycian, does that mean he's like me? The same as... Like the Palermo prosecutor ... Echelon! The same ... And the police chief ... They are all Sicilians. And I, like many others ... I'm a peaceful man and I don't bother anyone! Only such a bastard put all kinds of filth in his head! But he was right about the Canapa brothers. I caught them in the act. We will also catch those who went to Spain. And very soon, we'll catch you too. Charley Siragusa could not accuse the Canapa brothers ... They were arrested three months ago. They were tried in Rome ... and released. We spin in a circle. Doesn't the circle include Antonino Sorci? We have documents. He founded a financial association with the Canapa brothers in Rome. Evidence, you must have evidence! A notary is needed to set it up. It was not too difficult to find the notary. It's the same one you used in Palermo when you bought Orleans Park. Together with Sorci and Mancino. Is it a crime to buy something for the land? Over 160,000 square meters! Urban land ... with building permit obtained from Palermo. If the city of Palermo gave me permission, it means everything is legal. Another buyer, also from here, is a university professor. There are many Christian Democrat politicians who have bought there. Things have changed, Lucky. If you say you can still play politics, you are making a big mistake. Which policy? Here, I even know the police chiefs involved in the traffic. In America, it's worth doing politics ... We are facing President Roosevelt! Leave President Roosevelt. Let's go back to your friend. Pasquale Eboli, no? "Eboli also has a barber shop in New York with his brother And another business, but I don't remember what it was about. " - Do you remember what the business is about? - Not. "Pasquale Eboli came to me to talk about a company, for which he would like to open branches in the big cities of Italy. " "But with Gigi Lombardi he talked about a nightclub in Rome with Lamarco, who came back from Miami with money from business ... about which, now, I do not remember anything. " Let's see if I can help you. Yes? They have a factory similar to the one you had in Palermo in '46 with Calogero Vizzini, said "Don Calbo," who disappeared in one night with three tons of confetti? Or packing sardines? Like Nick Gentile does, right? Or cheese? How is Carlos Marcello in Tunis? Or tomatoes, like Joseph Profaci's "Mama Mia Import Company," from New York? Or maybe a factory for broth cubes? Natural broth for export. That's what Frank Coppola does in Pomezia. From Pomezia a box of heroin was sent to Castellmare . Do you think I don't understand, Lucky Luciano? We arrested 40 people in Italy and America. I found counterfeit money and drugs! They were all your friends! Only the three managed to reach Spain, because in America, delinquents are released on bail. This is our country's system! So now you will receive calls and telegrams from Spain every day. From Madrid osau to Barcelona! And then you will meet "by chance", at the racecourse or at the restaurant to talk ... who knows what nonsense, to dance or ... What happened?! What do you have? Do you feel bad? You want a coffee? I do not drink coffee... I don't smoke ... Give me a glass of water, please. Bring him a glass of water. Your old friends scared you, didn't they? It has nothing to do with my friends. The cops are to blame. New York cops. Anyway, I have a lot of scars ... On all body. I had two heart attacks. Can I go to the bathroom? I'll go with you. When you were in America ... you gave an address ... where police found an entire crate of heroin. If I don't know anything, I can't tell you. I don't know anything today. You can talk to me. I have my own ideas about you. And they are a little different from Syracuse. You deserve it. It's worth it for you. And for your career. For you... You are like Asslinger, like Syracuse, like all generals and police chiefs ... And like all politicians. You entertain people ... to know nothing, and to understand nothing! Politicians have always done well, between criminals and what you call ... mafioþi! I'm sorry, but I can't help you. Get him to sign the report, and then drive him to the airport, to catch the plane to America. - And then we arrest them both? - If you find drugs. If not, take the copy and send it to Syracuse. Finally, it's something else now! You're dead before! You can look. Mr. Luciano, we just need a yes or a no. We have to start and we need time ... What happened? Aren't you feeling well? Mr. Luciano ... What is it? Come back! - Who are you? - The police. Call a doctor! What are we doing now? We continue to follow Luciano ... Dewey continues to pursue us ... and Kefauver follows Dewey. When all this running is over, they will all wake up in the same place where they left off. Oh, Charlie, Charlie!
