Okay, showtime. It's my quarter. Come on, I... Oh, boy, this is really something. - Well, let me see. - Give me another quarter. Thank the Lord for making babies like this. Is she nude? She's taking her bra off. Oh, boy, I'm going to need a bigger telescope. Come on, come on, give me another quarter. This is my last one. She's taking her panties off. Whoa, there's two of them. What, two panties? Two women, you dumb-head. They're getting down on him. Both of them. - Oh, let me look, let me look! - Okay, okay. Hurry up, it's going to rain. Where are they? Fuck! - You moved the telescope. - What floor was it? I don't know. You're too high. To the left, to the left. Oh, oh, I got them. I got them. Oh, fuck! Give me a quarter. Give me a quarter. - I don't have any quarters. - Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck! That's right, use your imagination. Six-five, come in, please. Yeah, six-five, Andy, here. What's up? What's your position, six-five? Uh, we're on the observatory deck on the 86th. We can't see you on the monitor. Check the camera, will you? Uh...oh, yeah. I--I see what's wrong. Some joker put a plastic bag over it. Damn tourists. Can you see me now? Yes, we can. Thanks. They were watching those hookers again. Must be Thursday, then. How time flies. God. Next time, bring more quarters. Next time, I want to see some of that ass, too. Whoa, that was a big one. Any damage? No, everything seems fine. I hope you're right. Next stop: the 66th. They got a very interesting collection of Swedish videos down there, and I'm not talking Ingmar Bergman either. Well, who's Ingmar Bergman? He's an actor, stupid. Hey, wait here a minute. I got to take a piss. Yeah, he was in Casablanca. Oh, yeah, that's right. Hey. Hey! Stop it! Fucking doors. Hey, if I tell you to stay open, stay open. What the fuck did you do? I don't know. I... Look at your flashlight. Who did you beat up? It was the elevator. I... No, watch out. You watch out. You know, one of these days I'm going to poison your donut. Are you coming or what? Yeah, sure. Your mother sure ate a lot of red meat when she was pregnant. The elevator did it. How dumb can you get? Hello? Hey, Jeff. What the fuck are you doing there? What, you--you couldn't make it to the front door? They stole my keys. Couldn't find them anywhere. The keys? You mean those with the Porsche key ring? Yeah, those. Here. Now hurry up, will ya? We're late as it is. Where'd you find them? Oh, my God, you have no idea how long I was looking. I'm sure, I'm sure, Mark. At least two minutes. Come on, move your ass. The bus is leaving in two more. I'm going. I'll break the speed limit, man. Hey, I'll be faster than lightning on steroids, okay? All right. Be right there. Man, you look like shit. Smell it, too. Must be my aftershave. So, the two of you have a fight again? Hey, man, what makes you think that we're fighting all the time? I don't know, it's just a hunch. Where are we going? Village. Just routine check-ups today. Exciting. Now, look, just be grateful I found you this job. Hey, I am grateful. Just the first few months aren't all that exciting, that's all. I wouldn't complain if I were you. He comes to me and he says, "You got to move up in the world, kid. You know, I'm going to help you out." I just didn't think that meant riding elevators all day long. If you don't like it, then quit, okay? - All right. - Go back to fixing Coke machines. Okay, all right, my head is killing me. I like this job. What makes you think I, for real, don't like this job? My ass is on the line, so don't fuck up. I won't. I solemnly swear. In fact, I'm going to become elevator mechanic of the year for you. It's 8:45 on WNYS. Time for a news and weather update. Flooding caused by heavy rain showers was reported in the Brooklyn area. Air traffic at Kennedy Airport was delayed for more than one hour due to a failure in the radar system. The cause of the failure has yet to be established. An investigation is underway. Meteorologists say that last night a record number of lightning strikes were counted. There you are, sweetie. Otherwise, I've got to go on to meet these people. There's nothing I can do... Grab my hand. Careful. Thank you, ma'am. - Hit it. Hit the button. - Step all the way in. Going UP- Morning, guys- Thanks for taking over for me. There was a traffic jam you wouldn't believe. No problem. I had to wait anyway. The wife's upstairs taking her pregnancy class. Oh, yeah, that's right. There's a little Freddy coming up. In her 32nd week. Breathe in, breathe out. Come up nice and slowly. Okay, that's it for today. See you ladies next week. - Goodbye! - Bye. He's been kicking like hell all week now. Sounds like his father. I'm sure glad he's not around anymore. Well, this is the easiest pregnancy I've ever had. He's asleep all day. Are you sure you're pregnant? Well, I should think so. Or this must be one hell of a tumor. Listen to you. You are so bad. I can't believe you. Come on, ladies. Let's move it. Well, I'm not looking forward to delivery day, I can tell you that. Just think of all those poor women in the middle of nowhere, without any help. Yeah, we are the lucky ones. My, we are going fast, aren't we? Yeah, is this normal? Oops, we got a problem. One of the express elevators again. What do you mean "again"? Must be something wrong with those lights. It's the third time this week. Every time there's nothing wrong. It'll stop flashing in a few minutes. Are you sure? My wife always uses them. Mark my words. Let me call maintenance just to be on the safe side. See? What did I tell you? They spend millions on those elevators. They can't even buy a decent lamp. What the hell happened? We're stuck. I told you we were going too fast. - Everybody, okay? - I think I sprained my ankle. Push the alarm. It's dead. It's dead! Strange, no network. What are we going to do? Let's just take it easy, now. I'm sure they know by now that we're stuck. Yeah, your husband works here, doesn't he? Yeah. Yeah. He'll have us out in no time. Don't worry. They play like wimps. Guys like that give basketball a bad name. They'll beat the Knicks anytime, with their eyes closed and one hand tied behind their backs. Duane here. What? Which one? No. Nothing here. Between 21 and 22? Okay. What? They must've fixed that light. It's getting hot in here. Well, there's no air. Help! Someone out there, we're stuck! You sure they know we're in here? Yeah, of course. Don't worry. We're on 22. Did you cut the power? Doing it now. Power's cut. Internal safety system's taking over. We're going to open the doors now. My wife took that elevator. Don't worry. Maintenance is getting them out right now. Are you sure this is the right key? - Well, it fits, doesn't it? - Yeah, it fits, but it doesn't work. - Hey, that's what-- - And don't tell me that's what your wife said last night. It's like a sauna in here. Oh, this can't be right. Get us out! Someone out there, let me out! It's no use. They can't hear us. I want out! Let me out! Oh, great. Well, if that doesn't get their attention... Turn that damned alarm off! Shut it off! I can't! - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. No. Duane, Tim here. We have a problem with the doors. - What kind of problem? - The doors are stuck. I don't know. We have to think of something else. You got the right key? - Of course I have the right key. - Fuck. Damn! - Are you crazy? - My wife's in there. - She's pregnant. - Everything's under control. There's no need to panic. I'm not panicking. Now get out the way. Give me that axe. Fuck! What the fuck? Tim, it's going down! Excuse me. Duane, it's Tim. The elevator's going down. I thought you cut the power. I did. I don't know what's happening. I'll alert lobby security. Copy that. The express elevator. We'll buy them all a cup of coffee. Mitch. - Out of my way. Coming through. - Excuse me. Two over easy, whiskey down, coming up! Lou, give me a poke in a boat and float it, Joe. Here you go. Oh, thanks, Peggy. Hey, you. - Something wrong, sir? - Yeah, you can say that again. - What are you trying to pull? - What's the problem? Three hamburgers, $24. What, you think I am too dumb to notice? I'm sorry. That's a mistake. Dom, we still need to fix that cash register! Register my ass. Now, you're trying to pull a fast one on me, ain't you? Hey! She said she was sorry. It was a mistake, you know. I don't think you should be talking to her like that. - What do you think? - What the fuck's it to you? I just think you're out of line, man. - It's all right, Mark. - Yeah. Shut your fucking mouth, you moron. What'd you say? Oh, what? Didn't you hear me? Must be a deaf moron. You got a big mouth. Hey, Mark, come on, your pastrami's getting cold. Yeah. Fuck off, dickhead. Come on, come on, come on. Here's your check, sir. The coffee's on the house. Cheeseburger! Got a cheeseburger! Why'd you stop me? I could take him. That guy's bigger than you are. He needed to be taught a lesson. We're not in the Marines anymore, Mark. You don't fight guys because they need to be taught a lesson. Well, then what did we do at Desert Storm? We fought small guys wearing big shoes that didn't fit. That's what we're good at. Next time, just stay out of my affairs, okay? I can handle myself. I'm a fully grown man. - Whatever you say, pal. - Hey, next time I want your opinion, I'll rattle your cage. All right, that's it. You better have insurance, pal. This guy" Good job, bud! I don't need insurance, you do. - Yeah. - Damn right. Pick it up or I toss it out. Why didn't you help me, man? Well, I figured you're a grown man. Are you okay? There's like a sound in my head. It sounds just like-- - My phone. - I'll get you an aspirin. Come on, I don't have all day. Give me the slip. Jeff here. Right. Hey, we got an emergency. Oh, no, it's fine. She's getting me an aspirin. No, no, no, I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about the Millennium Building. - The what? - The Millennium Building. You know that big building? You know, New York's most famous landmark? Right, I know, and it's very high. Yeah, most skyscrapers are. Now, come on, get on your feet. I hope you didn't forget how to walk. I'm out of bagels over here! Let's go! Clean up that mess over there, will you? Give them a hand. - Chip! - What? My computer's acting weird. You mean like me when I asked you out? Worse. Impossible. Ugh, looks like a virus. Oh, shit, not now. Nail the bastard, will you? Yeah, yeah, let me see what I can do. Nice warm seat. It's the closest you'll get. Yeah. Uh...okay. - You want some coffee? - Oh, no, thanks. I feel like a cappuccino machine already. - Well, I'm going to have some. - Okay. - Miss Evans! - Yes. It's your lucky day. Get your pretty ass over to the Millennium Building. - What happened? - An elevator got stuck. - Some women got sick. - But I'm working on that piece on the struggle for women's voting rights. - When was that? - 1918. - A bit after the fact, isn't it? - Yeah, but I think-- No buts. I want 400 words by 6:00. And make it juicy. I'll pee on them. Hey, Barney, what happened here? Hey. A bunch of women got stuck in an elevator or something. That must be the last one now. Poor woman. - Freddy? - I'm right here, honey. Where's my baby? Where's my baby? There were babies? Not when they got in. Hey, where are you going? - What's your name, ma'am? - Up, up. No, you can talk to me. I'm a nurse. Was it a boy or a girl? If you can't behave yourself, I'm not going to do you any favors anymore. - Now, come on. - Relax. I'm just doing my job. They gave birth? Two of them. You wouldn't believe the mess. There was also something about the air conditioning. It got so hot, they almost suffocated. No, that's not possible. Well, they sure looked pale to me. This is your man. - Hi. - Hi there. I'm Duncans, maintenance chief. It's a terrible thing that happened here. Well, I hope you're not going to blame us for this little birth wave. Of course not. It was probably the choice of God to give life in a stuck elevator. Who knows? All I know, it's my responsibility to get these elevators up and running again as soon as possible. Where did it get stuck? Between 21 and 22. Couldn't get the damn doors open. - Just came down by itself? - Yeah. After we cut the power. Normally we don't call you people in just for a stuck elevator. We're trained for emergencies like this. Getting people out, getting the cars running again. Most of the time it's little things, like a fuse or something. The air conditioner seems to be working fine. Yeah, that's what I noticed. God damn it, there better be a good explanation for this. It's going to cost us a fortune even if they don't sue. Which they will. These gentlemen are from the elevator company. Milligan. I'm the manager. Well, what's the verdict? How soon can we get this elevator back in action? Looks like it can be very soon. Within the hour, I'd say. Make it as quick as possible. I want a full report by late this afternoon. No problem, sir. Nice guy- No, I understand his problem. These express elevators carry over 30,000 people a day. They lose a lot of money when they're out of order. All right, well, let's get started before he deducts it from our paycheck. Tim here will take you guys up to the engine room. Fine, let's go. Hey, Mark, you coming? Yeah. Jeez, this is high! You're not going to tell me now you're afraid of heights, are you? I am. I just left that off the application. Oh, falcons. The city has brought them in to keep the pigeon population down. They love it here. Something to do with the thermals. Here we are. Hey, a terrible thing what happened to your colleague, that Polish guy. Kowalski. Yeah. Couldn't believe it at first. He was such a cheerful fellow, and then committing suicide the way he did. Yeah, well, you know, it just goes to show you never really know someone. Yeah, I guess that's true. I don't know much about computers and stuff, but there was a lot of lightning last night. - We counted four strikes. - So, what are you saying? Are you saying lightning struck the control unit? It's a possibility, ain't it? Kennedy Airport was shut down for two hours. We're talking about the latest technology here. Electrostatic fields or radiation fucking up computers like this, it's a thing of the past. - Well, you're the experts. - Yeah, that's right. I'll leave you to it, then. If you need anything, call 9-0-0. Yeah, we will, thanks. - You pissed him off. - Yeah, of course I did. No one tells me what to do or what to look for. What if he was right about the lightning? Very unlikely, but even if he was, we ain't going to admit it. We're the experts, right? All right, express elevators, G banks. Here it is. All right, you go over the car. The air-co, the alarm system, the door-locking mechanism, the wiring. Yeah. Why don't I check his police record while I'm at it? I'll go over the relay boxes and check this baby here. See you down there. Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. I feel like a coffee and donut, all right? Go ahead. I hope you're not planning on spending the rest of afternoon on that air-co. Bests me what's wrong. I can't find a thing. Ah, they'll be happy to hear that. - What is that? - It's just a draft. - A draft? - Yeah. It isn't like those 10- or 20-story buildings you're used to. This baby here is over a thousand feet high. You can get a temperature difference of more than 30 degrees. Believe me, it can storm up there. Well, next time I'll bring my umbrella. Let's go. Tell them they can turn it on again. I got to get my vest. What are we going to report? Report everything's fine. They're going to want to know why the thing got stuck. All right, so I'll make them happy and I'll say one of the switches needed a drop of oil. - Oh, fuck. - What? Ah, I dropped my wallet. - Would you hurry up? - Did it? Did it what? Did one of the switches need a drop of oil? No, of course not, but we can't say we don't know, right? So we give them something minor so they can sleep at night. Man, you got a lot to learn. Come on, let's go. You got everything now? You got your keys, your credit cards, your rubbers? Yeah, I'm all set. Hey, you still got time to buy flowers. Flowers? What flowers? Thanks, Tracy. I'm sure you did a nice job again. I hope your wife likes it, Mr. Faith. I think she'll be too busy to notice with all those guests. Don't blame her. You don't celebrate your 25th wedding anniversary every day. With the wash it totals $66.50. Thanks. It's a pity this is your last day here. I always enjoyed your company. I'll miss you. I'll miss you, too, Mr. Faith. Can I look at you one last time? Of course. I think you've seen enough, Mr. Faith. You're so beautiful, Tracy. Here is your credit card and your receipt. Thanks, Tracy. Good luck with the new job. And you have a very pleasant wedding anniversary. I will, thanks. Come on, Buster. Green hair? Are you nuts? The dirty prick deserves it. Ah, that's quick. Come on, Buster. I'm sure I pressed the right button. I guess we get company, Buster. Is there anybody there? Hello? I guess not. Is this going to happen or what? Man, elevator. Come on, Buster, let's take one of the others. I'll be damned! Yeah, that's what I think. At last. Come on, Buster. Don't you get difficult now. Hey, it's me, Mark. Mark. Yeah. How are you doing? Okay. Why are you calling? I just wanted to apologize, you know. I--last night I said some things I didn't mean, and... Uh, yeah. Look, I'm really busy right now. Well, I just wanted to say I was sorry. Can't you call back later? I bought you flowers. Why did you do that? I want to make up. Mark... Hey, open up. Open up? I'm outside. I'm in the hallway. - You're what? - Surprise, surprise. Oh, Jesus, Mark, I... Are you going to keep me waiting out here all day? Come on, I said I was sorry. Here you go. Mark, you shouldn't have come. I know, well... Your clothes. You're sleeping. Were you asleep? Oops. I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry, Mark. No, it's cool. I'm sure you are. I didn't... All--all that stuff I just said, I was just joking, or... Um...I'll talk to ya. I mean, what did I do wrong? I mean, look at me. Basically, I'm a very nice guy. Mark, just forget the bitch, okay? - She wasn't worth it. - That's your sister. Hey, this is my half-sister. The cheating half. This obviously wasn't your lucky day. No. You can say that again, and I'm not even going to go into all the stuff that happened at the Millennium Building, because, you know, you're pregnant and all. Jeff told me. What a horror story. Well, you know, you were complaining this morning about how dull this job was. I take it back. Waitress! - Mark, Mark, Mark... - The same, please. - Haven't you had enough? - So what? Come on, I'm fine. Getting drunk's not going to help anything. You're just going to feel sick in the morning. So what, man? It's Friday, right? It's our day off tomorrow, isn't it? No, we're on standby tomorrow. That's what I call a day off. If there's an emergency, they call on us. And I don't want you drunk on the job. - Here you go. - Thank you. Hey, cheers. To the exciting life of an elevator repairman. Oh! Damn! - What? - I tripped. Why can't you watch where you're going? Well, why can't we put on the lights? Because we're not supposed to be here, jerk. Here. Better check it. It may be poisoned. - Poisoned? - Yeah. We don't want the board of directors dropping dead in their chairs tomorrow, now, do we? Well, why would someone poison it? They wouldn't, you asshole. - I'm joking. - You are? Six-five, come in, please. Six-five, Andy here. What's up? Yeah, what's your position, six-five? We're on the 44th. One of the express elevators is moving up right now. Yeah, well, it's not us. Maybe the cleaners. Nah, we don't got cleaners in that part of the building. Besides, all the offices should be closed. What floor is it going to? It's just passed 24. Still going UP- We'll have a look. Come on. What do you think? Burglars or...? Still going UP- Ah, probably just some asshole forgot to check in. Wait, it stopped at your floor. Yeah, yeah, we're almost there. Doors are opening. No one's coming out. Careful. We didn't see anyone come out. Fuck, fuck. Why can't you watch where you're going? I'm sorry, I just... It stopped at 40. Roger. Roger. Come on, we'll take the stairs. - Is it still on 40? - Affirmative. Doors are open again. Subject's still inside. - You guys want backup? - No. We can handle this. All right, all right, now watch where you're going. Don't alarm him again. - Fuck! - I didn't do anything. It's going up again. Yeah, I can see that. You guys aren't fucking with us down there? - I mean, it's not funny. - We're not! It stopped again on 44. I'm not running up and down like a goddamn yo-yo. Hey, my flashlight's... I'll be damned. Look, careful. Don't go too far. Hey, Andy, I don't like this. - Jesus fucking Christ. - What? There's a dog down there. Dog? What kind of dog? I don't know what kind of dog. What kind of dumb question...? Fuck. Help me, God damn it. Get me out. Why don't you try turning your head and wrenching it out? I ain't fucking Houdini! Who's Houdini? Six-five, what are you doing? He--he--he's stuck between the doors! Stuck between the doors? Come on, shouldn't we get them backup? Oh, damn, the elevator. Jesus. The elevator. It's coming! What? Andy... Gary, it stopped. Well, should I...? Do you want me to...? Where are you? Gary? God, help me! Do something! The three express elevators have been closed down since early morning, leaving hundreds of tourists stranded outside the building. The press is not allowed inside. Only people employed here can enter. So far, the police have not disclosed anything about the cause of these tragic accidents, which have claimed the lives of one visitor and one security guard. Unconfirmed rumors also mention a dog among the victims. We'll be back as soon as we have any more information. This is Tina Bradley, TMC News, reporting live from the Millennium Building. I don't like elevators. Fact is, I hate them. Anything below 10 floors, I walk. Well, Lieutenant, this city must really wear you out, then. Do you have any idea how many people get stuck in elevators every year? Huh? I--I don't know. I don't know. A hundred? Two hundred? A thousand? 1,832,000 people every year in this country. That's a fact. I think it's too early to say for sure that we're dealing with a mechanical malfunction. We have never had a problem with these elevators before. You're very, very lucky. People fall down empty shafts all the time, or they get their limbs caught between the cars. Doesn't make the headlines. That's why you never read about it. Maybe you could tell that to all those journalists downstairs. This one is much more spectacular. You know, decapitations don't happen that much. They capture people's imagination. Security reported someone in the building. Did you find any evidence to support that? Well, we tried talking to the security guard that witnessed the accident, but poor fellow's in shock. He's barely coherent, and the doctors have no idea when he'll be able to make a statement. So it's very possible there was some unauthorized person in the building. Oh, who would that have been? The invisible man? We looked at the video. It doesn't show anybody ever entering or leaving the elevator. Well, elevators can't operate by themselves, now, can they? Well, that's a fair assumption. I'm no expert on elevator behavior, but couldn't somebody be playing with the controls? You mean one of our employees? Well, so far, Forensics hasn't found a trace of an intruder. No, that's out of the question. The guards that were on duty can be fully trusted. They've been with us for years. If you say so. Those elevator mechanics, when can we expect a report from them? Well, I figure any minute now. They've been here since early morning. - Finished? - Uh, yeah, for now. I got you a coffee. Thank you. Is it true what they say? About what? That more people die in elevator accidents than in plane crashes. I wouldn't know. Uncle of mine got stuck last week for nine hours. Him and eight others. Had to pee and shit in a corner. Fella got sick, threw up all over the place. My uncle said he'd have died of the smell long before he'd have starved. Something wrong with the coffee? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. It's like my stomach's not, though. So, what's the problem? Just a wild night. Like that elevator? Who's your tailor? It'll shrink in the wash. You're a reporter, aren't you? Yeah. Jennifer Evans, Morning Post, at your service. You guys'll do anything for a sleazy story. I'm not a guy. Shit. Fuck off! Just tell me what's wrong with that elevator, will you? There's nothing wrong with that elevator. A guy fell down the shaft, another one was decapitated. I don't call that nothing. Hey, we all have our bad days. And the pregnant women yesterday, they also had a bad day? Elevators like to kill people. It's common knowledge. Ten people get on, nine people get off. Oh, come on, be serious. I'm not going to say anything to you. I'm not allowed to say anything to you. Just give me some facts, will you? You want money? Just clean the toilet, will you? You sure you didn't see anyone? Hey, you there. - That's her? - I'm with him. I don't know her. We were just in the toilet together. Sure, you were. And now you're going back to the sewer. But he raped me. No, Officer, arrest that man! - Get off! - Yeah, yeah, lady. Come on. Well, you got taste. You find anything? Uh, doors work smooth as a baby. I don't understand. Yeah, yeah, same here. Nothing wrong with the computer. I checked everything twice. Maybe I overlooked something. You know, sometimes you just don't see the obvious. You didn't overlook anything. It's just...it's just one of those things. It's like airplanes going down and no one ever finds out why. Well, that's another thing that worries me. Well, stop worrying. It's bad for your heart. Come on, let's go down, tell them what they want to hear. Yeah. Now, let me get this straight. You're saying there's nothing wrong with those elevators, and that it's perfectly safe for the public to ride them? That's right. We checked everything thoroughly. We didn't encounter any problems whatsoever. Lieutenant? I won't argue with the experts. Let's hope when we finish our investigation, we'll know more about what caused these accidents. So there's no objection to opening the elevators again? Well, if I thought there was any hazard to the public, I wouldn't allow it. Well, I'm glad to hear that, Lieutenant. These gentlemen have convinced me they're perfectly safe. That's right. That's our conclusion. Yeah, it is, for the moment. For the moment? Well, we did do the best we could, considering the time that we had. What my colleague means is, there's always the option of a major overhaul. That means going into the shaft and checking every nut and bolt. Like you guys did three months ago? - Right. - Oh, no, no. We had to shut those elevators down for a whole week. Yeah, that's right. Things like that take time. But considering we just did a major check three months ago, I don't think there's any need to do it again. Closing down those express elevators for a whole week would be a financial disaster. There are 15,000 people employed here. And I'm not even talking about all the tourists. - Like I said, it's not an option. - That's right. Duncans, get those elevators running again. - Jesus, are you fucking crazy? - What? You know, Mr. Alcohol sure put you in a talkative mood today. A major overhaul, checking the whole shaft. Do you have any idea what that costs? People have been killed, Jeff. It seems like you don't really give a shit about that. I'd like to know what's going on with all this. Hey, let the police find out what happened. I just don't buy it that a blind guy forces the elevator doors open and commits suicide with his dog. Why not, Mark? I would if I had green hair. Well, the security guy didn't have green hair, all right? How did he end up with his head stuck between the elevator doors, huh? I mean, there are all kinds of safety devices to prevent that from happening, man. Yeah, that's right, Mark. And they all worked perfectly when I checked them today. What about the women yesterday? What do they got to do with this? All right, you're arranging all this shit simply because I complained how dull this job was going to be. Mark, I don't know why all these things are happening, okay? Maybe it's just one hell of a coincidence. All I know is there's nothing wrong on our side. And if they're going to try to put the blame on us, I'm not going to let them. We also want to raise the issue of safety. Today's technology can be a blessing or a curse. We have guests in our studio, and you at home can call the number on your screen with questions. Marcia, you had a terrible experience with an elevator, didn't you? Yes, I did. Well, after the break, you can tell us all about it. And also why you still miss your father. Everything is wrong Since me and my baby parted All day long I'm walking 'Cause I couldn't get my car started Laid off from my job And I can't afford to check it I wish somebody'd come along And run into it and wreck it Come on Since my baby parted Come on I can't get started Come on I can't afford to check it I wish somebody'd come along And run into it and wreck it Everything is wrong Since I've been without you Every night I lay awake Thinking about you Hey! Hey, Mickey, look who's here. Hey, Mark, how does it feel to be famous? Can I have your autograph? - What's going on? - Didn't you see the paper? - What paper? - Hey, Mark. Mitchell wants to see you in his office right now. "The elevator just had a bad day," said one of the mechanics with a pale, scared face. "One out of every 10 passengers doesn't get out of an elevator alive." Are those your words? I... maybe. Are you fucking crazy? What kind of an idiot thing is that to say? I...I was joking, I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing this morning. Especially on my phone. Now, we've spent years establishing the fact that elevators are one of the safest means of transportation. I mean, hell, we have to. We live in a vertical world. If you can't trust elevators, what the fuck can you trust? Now, I don't need stories like this. And I don't need the cops breathing down my ass inquiring about you. About me? They read the papers, too, you know. Wouldn't be the first time some lunatic pulled some spectacular stunt to get his ugly mug in the papers. Oh, this is-- this is ridiculous. I'm a suspect? Well, they wanted to know all about you. But, hey, what do I know? You've been here, what, six months? Nobody ever complained before till today. - I'm sorry. - Well, you can't blame them for following every lead, can you? If they think I had anything to do with those accidents, they're wasting their time. Look, Mark, I'm not going to fire ya, although the thought did cross my mind this morning. But I got to trust Jeff on this. For some strange reason, he's putting his ass on the line for you. Well, the last thing I want to do is get Jeff into trouble. Well, he's right. You're a good mechanic. But just do your fucking job, all right? Like Jeff. I mean, he's been here two years, he works his ass off, he's loyal to the company, and he believes in what he's doing. Now a guy like that, he can move up in this organization. You catch my drift? I'll do my best. I hope you do. So let's consider this just a bad mistake, one that'll never happen again. It won't. I'll promise you that. Murphy? I'm not working with Jeff today? - Well, you can read, can't you? - Well, yeah, but why? I suppose he has another job. Murphy can use some help. Just do as you're told. Right. Yo, Mark, my man. - I hear we partners today. - That's what I hear. Hey, listen, man, I'm real glad you didn't get fired. I almost got promoted. Homes, you did get promoted. You're working for me now. Oh, did Jeff grab his reserved parking space again? - Who's that guy? - Don't you know? Man, that's Steinberg, that German prick from Research. Why is he a prick? They feel superior to us, man, 'cause we out there doing all the dirty work while they enjoying themselves in their clean white labs, playing with their fancy computers. Sounds like somebody made a bad career move. Well, they do get bigger paychecks than us. Yeah, but we get to have all the fun, right? Damn right. Hey, that guy Kowalski, how'd he kill himself? Blew his mind out in his car near the East River. Set himself and the car on fire. Why? Didn't he work on the elevators in the Millennium Building? Yeah, that's right. Together with Jeff. Come on, man, you don't think he had anything to do with those accidents, now, do you? No, no. Come on, man. Drink up. We got to go. - We got a busy, busy day. - Hey, where are we going? - Harlem. - You hip, bro. Yo, get out of my way! Hey, hey, hey! What the hell you doing? I don't need no ticket. - Screw you, man! - Get back here! Corning! Beat you! Even the smallest coin can make a two-inch hole in the pavement. So please be careful. Took a wrong turn or what? Oh, Jesus! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Yo, Janet. Girl, you looking as sweet as ever. Hello, Murphy. Who's your friend? This here's Mark. He's my partner for today. Now, what you got for today's special? Except for, of course, that sweet smile of yours. - Pork chops. - What's special about them? - I sat on them for two hours. - This afternoon, - the Millennium Building... - Can't resist that. was the scene of a tragic accident. According to eyewitnesses, the victim raced out of the elevator at high speed, smashed through a window and fell 86 floors to his death. Traffic was jammed for half an hour. Police sources have told TMC that this suicide was in no way related to last week's accidents. - Mark. He gonna have some food here. - Give me the keys, the car keys. - Now, come on. - You left something in the car? Janet, listen, man, I'm missing you already. Yo, Mark! Damn. Come on, Mark, we ain't got no business here. I'm sorry, sir, no one is allowed into the building. I'm from the elevator repair company. Please wait outside, sir. What's going on? Not allowed to tell you that. They're giving a statement to the press right now. - Where? - Outside, sir. Come on, man, I'm starving. ...not yet identified, jumped from the 86th floor. The main focus of the investigation is to determine how it was possible for the victim to break through 12 millimeters of glass. If we find any trace of any negligence regarding safety procedures, they will be reported to the Building Safety Commission. Lieutenant, Lieutenant, was there any evidence of foul play? So far, nothing points in that direction. But as I said, this is an ongoing investigation. Is there a correlation between this accident - and the others that occurred recently? - Oh, no. There's nothing to support that theory. - All right, folks... - Hey! Hey! Look, I'm sorry, okay? I don't make the headlines. They fucked up. It's not my fault. You did write the story, though. Yeah, I might have, but sometimes computers fuck up, strange things happen. Yeah, the strangest thing is having the police on my ass now. The police? I became a suspect because of your article. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that to happen. But, you know, I just wrote down what you told me. Don't do it again, okay? I mean... Okay. So, what happened here? A guy killed himself. Jumped through a window on the 86th floor. - Suicide? - That's what the police think. You're not going to turn this into some kind of horror story, are you? Well, I'm just after the truth. - Oh. - You don't believe me? - No. - Oh. You know, I'm just trying to make a living here. Life's hard enough as it is. Hey, you know what? Just leave me out of it, all right? - What, my life? - Your story. Hey, come on, man. Can we go now? I do not want to get into trouble here. Yeah, I'm done here. - Thank you. - Here you go. Good afternoon, Mr. Milligan. Your Japanese guests have arrived. Japanese,Japanese... Oh, yeah, yeah. Send them right up. All right, Benson, what's the damage? We can forget about opening the 86th for the public today. Tomorrow will be the soonest. Great. What else is there? Just got a call from Parker, Miles & Baker about that office space on the 91st. Mm-hmm. Who was doing the calling? Miles. Well, they're signing the leases today, aren't they? That was the plan, but they canceled it. Canceled it? Why? Oh, no, no, no. Those goddamn elevators. Quiet! Little bastards. Don't fuck with me. Bunch of losers you are, all of you. What's the use? Most of you won't make it anyway. If you don't get knocked down by a car or drink a bottle of Drano or set fire to your bedroom, in a few years' time, you'll all be on drugs or selling your bodies in cheap hotels. Whatever the future is, you little creeps, it is not yours, believe me. Twinkle, twinkle, little star How I wonder what you are Up above the clouds so high Like a diamond in the sky Twinkle, twinkle, little star How I wonder what you are One of you bastards seen Mary Jane? Bunch of brain-deads! Mary Jane? Mary Jane? Good afternoon, Mr. Milligan. How are you today? Are you looking for someone, Ilsa? One of the children. We're playing hide-and-seek. What is the matter with you, screaming like that? What have you done? My God, is she all right? Yes. She was just playing. You know how kids are. Shall we go back to your friends now? Come along, Mary Jane. Stupid little girl. Ah, children. Well, I am now going to show you the exercise room. It's equipped with everything you'll need. Right? Uh, no, why don't we take the stairs? It's just two floors up. Might as well start exercising right now. Follow me. Shit! Wow, big bat. - What the fuck? - The bell doesn't work, the light's out, there's no name on the door. What are you, in some kind of witness protection program? They're supposed to protect me from young, sleazy female reporters, but I don't think they're doing their job. What do you want? I want to come in. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? No. Happen to be in the neighborhood? Yeah, something like that. You like music? I like jukeboxes. But what's a jukebox without music? Uh, let me guess, a life without love. I knew you were the romantic type. What's that? You like movies? Only X-rated, baby. Well, don't worry, I cut out the dull parts. - Can we use your VCR? - Yeah. - You stole the tape? - I borrowed it. Look familiar? Millennium Building, parking garage. Right. Guy's suicide on tape. Look, you know what? I'm not into, like, the whole kinky thing, you know? I don't like seeing people being killed on tape. Just watch, will you? Look, here they come. They're racing each other. Okay, this is another camera. I made a compilation of several different tapes. And this car almost wipes him out. The elevator doors open. He gets in. - Almost jumps in. - Mm-hmm. And this is one of the cameras on the observation deck. There he goes. Well, you know, you got, like, a tape of a suicide. You can sell it to the networks and make a few bucks. You didn't see it. - What? - I can't blame you. It took me a while to notice, too. What'd I miss? Just watch the time codes. Okay? See the time code? 36:12. Now, this is the camera on the 86th floor. Look at the time code. - That's not possible. - That's what I thought. Between the time the doors close in the parking lot and the time they open again on the 86th floor... - Two seconds. - 1.8 seconds, to be exact. Oh, there's something wrong with the time codes. No, there isn't. I checked. They all receive the same time code pulse. It's just not possible. That elevator takes at least 40 seconds to go up. Forty-two. I did it this afternoon. It took more time for that guy to come down than go up. You can say that again. Fucking shit. So, you still think there's nothing wrong with those elevators? - You better wait here. - Why? He hates journalists. Well, so did you. Look at us now. We're working together. I still think you should wait. Is that your friend? - That's him. - Let's go. Jeff. Mark, what are you doing here? What, you don't answer your phone? We were out. Who's that? That's Jennifer. She works for the Morning Post. I'm a journalist. Jesus, Mark, what are you doing? That article this morning, you know, you're really fucking things up, man! Jeff, you've got to see this tape. What tape? I got no time for this bullshit! Jeff, no, man, you've got to look at the tape. It has to do with the elevators at the Millennium Building. You know, Mark, this is really turning into an obsession for you. And why are you doing this? What's it to you? Man, fuck it, Jeff. You know damn well what's going on with the elevators, so fucking tell me. I'm your friend. I'm trying to help. Stop trying. All right, Mark? Stop trying. Now, get out of here. The two of you. I don't want to get you in any trouble. - What trouble? - Just go. Come on. Jeff, be reasonable. Is he always like that? No. It's not like him at all. Mildred, what's happening? He took me to an expensive restaurant tonight. We've only been there once before, when he proposed to me... the night before you guys went off to Desert Storm. I think that elevator's haunted. Sure, why not? Make a great headline. You know, Manhattan was an Indian settlement in the 17th century. So it's quite feasible that the Millennium Building was built on ancient burial ground. And Indian forefathers are haunting us right now. Okay, maybe there was some kind of radiation leakage from some secret nuclear plant here in New York? Stephen King's got a lot to answer for. Well, so far you've come up with nothing. I mean, what am I supposed to write about? We agreed that you would write nothing for the moment. No, we agreed to help each other. But your little Army buddy hasn't been very helpful. Marines. We were Marines. Whatever. Is he a good friend of yours? I owe him a lot. I don't know what's the matter with him. I got a really bad feeling, though. Me, too, in my stomach. I could really use some food. Well, that's something we can solve. So, let's see if I got this straight. Elevators have a mechanical part and an electronic part. The electronics control the elevators, making sure they don't all go to the same floor at the same time. They also regulate the doors, the air conditioning, the speed and so on. Exactly. It's like the brains of the elevator installation. And what about that Steinberg guy? Where does he fit in? He designs the electronics. Did he fuck up? I don't know. What kind of guy is he? I never met him. No, don't turn this into, like, this mad-scientist thing now. It's, like, way too easy. We got to keep all our options open. Okay, what about this one? Max Steinberg. No. Crashed his car into a tree in 1986. We're wasting our time. Well, it would've helped if you'd known his first name. Even then, we came across 11 Johns. Somehow, I don't think his name is John. Well, what is it, then? - Gunther. - Gunther? Gunther Steinberg, former Harvard graduate, joins research team of Professor Malcolm Mckenzie at Kodelt Industries. - Would that be him? - Maybe. - No photo? - No. Let's...let's try Harvard. That's him. Twenty years younger. Studied computer science, biomedical sciences, and engineering. Graduated 1977 cum laude two years ahead of schedule. Best boy in his class, huh? Sure sounds like it. So, what's Kodelt Industries? What is that about? I don't know. Let's check. Bribery, illegal use of government money. Not a pretty company. No mention of Steinberg. They went bankrupt in 1994. What was that? Go back. What? That's him, isn't it? I don't know, you tell me. - That's him. - Christmas 1989. Fort Benning, Georgia. He worked for the Army? That doesn't look like a fancy dress party to me. - Hey, Jennifer. - Hey, Chip. Hey, Russell really liked your story on that suicide, especially the whole "Tower of Death" bit. I left you out. This is Mark. - Yeah, Chip. - Hey. Kodelt Industries? You're into guided missiles now? Yeah, you know them? Chip knows everything about computers. Oh, that figures. Yeah, they make computer systems for the Army. Missiles and stuff. - Right. They went bankrupt. - Doesn't surprise me. They really fucked up with those bio-chips. - What's that? - Computer chips based on live tissue. They were making a computer based on dolphin brains or something like that. Did it work? Yeah, I remember now. The whole thing went totally out of control. This computer, it developed a mind of its own. And the strangest thing of all was that these chips, they were able to reproduce themselves so that the whole computer was growing and behaving like a living organism. - Are you kidding? - No, no. It should be in there somewhere. - So, what happened to it? - Don't know. It must have committed suicide or had a heart attack. Poor thing. Hey, you know of a guy named Steinberg? Don't think so. Who is he? He worked for them. We can't find much on him. I'll give it a try if you want. Does it have something to do with this elevator? Maybe. - Okay. - Chip, I'm off in a minute. Yeah, yeah. I'll do it later. Hmm. To me, it's a clear-cut case. Steinberg fucked up with those bio-chips. They kicked him out. He got a job in the Army, he fucked up again, they sacked him, and he ended up in that elevator company of yours. - Yeah, a real loser, huh? - Yeah, but he wouldn't give up. He experimented with that elevator computer, and something went wrong. The machine got a mind of its own and now it's taking revenge on humanity. A machine cannot get a mind of its own. It's a dead thing. We can easily find out who's right. All right, tell me how. That computer's located in the engine room, right? No way. No, forget it. We are not breaking into the Millennium Building. You're just afraid I'm right, aren't you? Machines, computers, do not reproduce, okay? Have you ever seen two chips fucking? Turn right here. There's a first for everything. I mean, why should we be the only ones who fuck? - We're not. - What? - We're not fucking. - No, but we can if we want to. - We have a choice. - Not tonight. I'm...I'm a little tired, I think. No, no, no, I-- I wasn't inviting you. I was...l was making a point. Of course. Of course you were. - It's right here. - All right. - Bye. - Bye. Morning, Mr. Milligan. Hello? Hey, how was your night last night? What? When? I'll be right over. Thank you, Sergeant Mallory, for this update on events. Now Lieutenant McBain will continue his statement. After that, we will have time for questions. Lieutenant? The suspect was found in one of the express elevators. Now, we're convinced that the deceased was involved in one or more of the accidents at the Millennium Building. While we're pretty sure we've got our man, I want to reiterate this is an ongoing investigation and future arrests are possible. All right, we're going to take some questions now. Jerry Seltzer, Washington Reporter. That's Steinberg. I know. Just how safe are elevators? I'm going to let Mr. Mitchell handle that one. As I explained before, elevators are one of the safest means of transportation. Security is, and has always been, our top priority. I would definitely rule out incidents like this in the future. Susan Whittaker, BCT. What was the killer's motive? That's under investigation right now. But building management received a note that I can only characterize as extortionist in nature. Fucking kidding me. So it might've simply been a matter of money. On the other hand, we may have a lunatic on our hands. As I told you earlier, we're in possession of an Army psychiatric report that described the deceased as a mentally deranged person, a wacko. That's bullshit. They're making this stuff up. Jennifer Evans, Morning Post. Ah, the Morning Post. Undoubtedly one of the more scintillating questions of the day. I have a question for Mr. Steinberg. Don't, please. I just want to ask him about those bio-chips. Your question, Miss Evans. I want to ask Mr. Steinberg... what's your favorite newspaper? Well, I can definitely say it's not yours. I think we all agree with that, Mr. Steinberg. Come on. Are there any other questions of substance? Marie-Anne Holland from Animal World. Our readers are very interested in the dog that was killed. Ah, finally, a serious question. Thank you. Hey. You embarrassed me. What'd you think the guy was going to say, huh? "Oh, yeah, Miss Evans, I put those chips in there. That's why the elevator fucked up." Be real already. Now your friend's going down in history as the Millennium Killer. He's a fall guy. They ain't getting away with that. Jeff is not a murderer. What was he doing near that elevator in the middle of the night? I mean, that is suspicious, isn't it? Well, I'm sure he had his reasons. And that extortion letter they mentioned? Yeah, that's real convenient. That's like that psychiatric report they came up with. - It's all lies. - A cover-up? - He's not the first. - The first what? This guy Kowalski died also. What--who's Kowalski? Jeff's old partner. I never met the guy, but they worked on that elevator together. They found him down near the East River. He was all burnt up in his car, and the police said it was suicide. - Was it? - Well, I'm beginning to wonder. I mean, maybe he knew too much. Had to get rid of him, you know? Why didn't you tell me about this before? Just didn't seem important. But now it's all too coincidental. You were afraid I'd write about it. You still don't trust me. Well, there's not a lot of people in this world you can trust. May as well trust you, though,huh? It's a start. They tore our whole house apart. What were they looking for? Evidence, they said, to prove his guilt. They took all kinds of personal stuff, even the letters he wrote me when we were dating. Crazy. They won't prove anything, because there's nothing to prove. I don't know what was wrong with him. He was acting so strange these last few weeks. Where was he going yesterday? He didn't tell me. Someone called, he got all nervous. - Who called? - I don't know. The German guy. Steinberg. He didn't do it, Mark. You know that, don't you? No, I know, Mildred. I know. I'm sorry. When Gerry died, something snapped inside of him. Who's Gerry? Kowalski. They worked together for more than two years. That's him. Who would've known they'd both die the same way? Wait a minute, Kowalski died in his car. No, he didn't. This must be it-- number 66. This one? That's it. She's not home. You want to wait? Maybe she's on vacation. She didn't answer the phone. What are you doing? What's it look like? It's called breaking and entering. Well, I call it investigative journalism. Hello, Mrs. Kowalski? Are you there? Hey, we can't do this, Jennifer. Hello? Somebody home? Look at that. That's Kowalski. Look at all this stuff. It's creepy. Hi. Mrs. Kowalski? We rang your bell. The door was open. Yeah, you should be careful about that, living in a neighborhood like this. Are you a friend of my husband? I'm a colleague. I didn't know Gerry personally. He was a good man. He didn't deserve to die. How did he die, Mrs. Kowalski? They killed him. Who killed him? They said it was an accident, but I know better. What happened? For three days they let him bleed inside the belly of that building. But he's still there. His spirit didn't leave us. He will only find peace when he's had his revenge. Did he ever tell you what was wrong with that elevator? Everyone who knows it is going to die. You don't mess with the devil himself. I don't think we're going to get much out of her now. Can we ask you one more question, Mrs. Kowalski? Let's go. No, don't you want to know who killed her husband? I got a pretty good idea. It's not over yet! It's going to get worse. Much worse. Okay, coming through here. Coming through. Hot food. Hot food here. Can I get in, please? Please? Going up to 16. Thank you. Hold the doors, please. - Thank you. - Six and 16. Hey, hold the door, please. Sorry. Ma'am, can you move a bit, huh? Hey, it didn't stop. Didn't stop on my floor. Did you push the button? Of course I did. What's going on? I have to get off here. We're going faster. Is this normal? Jesus, Anne, you pushed the button too hard. Make it stop! Please make it stop! - Oh, my God! - I'm going to be sick. Hello? Where are you?! Help! Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. Fellow Americans, this afternoon, one of this nation's most famous and prestigious landmarks, the Millennium Building, was the scene of a vile and malevolent act of terror. I assure the American people that we will not rest until those responsible for this cruel act are tracked down, apprehended, and convicted. We have already taken decisive measures to prevent a recurrence of these events. FBI investigators are on the scene working closely with the New York Police Department. During their investigation, the building and surrounding area will be sealed off to the public. Our sympathy goes to the families of those deceased. It is events of this sort that test the mettle of the American people. Is this what you were trying to achieve? Chaos? The whole city, the whole country, in total turmoil? What's wrong with you? I mean, the slightest setback... Slightest setback? Slightest setback? Two of my best fucking men are dead. Now, let's face the music, pal. You can't control this thing. I can. I can solve it. I just need time. Trust me. Look, every major step forward in the history of mankind has not been without its sacrifice. Think what this invention could do for humanity. I'm talking about changing the way they work, the way they think. It could be like a complete new renaissance for the human race. Mitch, you knew what you were getting yourself into. You lied to me every step of the way. Jesus Christ, all the secrecy, all the boasting about your upper echelon Army connections. Well, I did some checking, Mr. Steinberg. Yeah, right. They threw your ass out after you failed disastrously. The project was declared officially dead. God. What a fool I was to believe you. This could make you a rich man. Fuck the money. If I go down, I'm not going down alone. I want you to end this thing right now. I don't know if I can. Listen to me, you twisted motherfucker. You created this monster, you kill it. Move in! Get the people away from the building! Here we go, here we go. Here you go. Right here. There's a spot. - Get this shot, okay? - Okay, I got it. I got it. Keep moving, please. Get that camera crew out of here! Keep it moving, please. All right, come on in, come on in. Keep it moving. Come on through. You sure you want to go through with this? You're chickening out. I knew it. You don't see what I'm seeing. Just keep your cool. Why don't we just tell them what we know? I don't trust them. If they're willing to falsify Jeff's whole psychiatric report, they're probably willing to try anything to sweep this whole thing under the rug. Get down. Evening, ma'am. What's your business here? Yeah, I got to deliver material for the investigation. Well, just go through and report to the checkpoint. Thanks. Whoo! - Piece of cake. - Told you. Oh, shit. We're never going to make it. Relax, we're as good as in. In deep shit, you mean. Let's see some ID. Yeah, I'm delivering material. That elevator's really fucked up, you know. What does the "M" stand for, Miss Newman? Martha. Yeah, I'm from the elevator company. I've been with them for years now. - Run a check on that. - Yes, sir. What's in the back? Stuff for elevators. Get out of the car, please. Ugh, you're kidding. It's raining. It'll ruin my hair. Get out of the car and open the back for us. Oh, fuck. Can't find the right key? Well, I'm sure it's got to be one of them. Just a second. - Yeah? - Hey, Jen. This is me, Chip. Am I interrupting anything? No. Well... It's the elevator company. I did some more checking like you asked me to. Yeah, go ahead. Those computers based on chips made from live tissue... Yeah, the fucking chips. They're still experimenting with them. I hear you. Only now they're not using dolphins anymore. You're kidding. You've got to be careful. This is some pretty weird stuff. The machine's not a machine anymore. What was that? Jen, where are you anyway? - Ma'am? - I, uh... - Are you still there? - Okay, so I checked with the elevator company, and everything's cool. Not with us, ma'am. Take her inside. - What? - Check the van! Clear! The van's clear! Right here. Over here. Free spot. Over here. One, two, three, and four. - Okay? - Stingers? Terrorists have airplanes, too. You don't believe that shit, now, do you? The president does. I think this whole thing is blown out of proportion. Well, they almost got the Twin Towers 10 years ago. These 90 to the roof? And the 86th, the observation deck. You sure this elevator's safe? I hope for you it is. I'm not riding it. These are the last ones? Yeah. Up you go. If you see Bin Laden, say hello. I will. Who is this, Sergeant? Subject tried to enter without proper identification. Who are you? I'm an elevator mechanic. Yeah, and I'm Winnie the fucking Pooh. I knew I'd seen you before. Look, you can call my boss. I can think of better things to do with my night off. I'm sure you can. - Everything okay? - Yeah. These two go to the roof. - Only two? - Need more? No. It's enough for the night. - Give me a hand. - See you brought enough ammo. Yeah. They were expecting a whole army? Okay, just put them there. We'll pick them up later. Let's go. Got some coffee up there? Coffee, beer, whiskey. Don't forget the two strippers. Well, at least we've got something to defend. Cover that up. Don't bang it. Careful. All right, all right. Keep it coming, guys. - Right up here. Get them up here. - You got it, boss. - One more. - Chief, over here? All right, put this one over here. Here we go, up. Hey, watch with that, huh? Easy,easy. - Come on, guys. - Come on, go, go. How many more of these we got to go? There's no way to override it. Believe me. Okay, chief, it's your building. Let's go! Come on. Yeah, good. Like that. Hey. One of the express elevators has been activated. That's impossible. The whole system's been shut down. Second team covering in the north position... Everyone is in position right now. Copy? Over. Yeah, roger that. All positions... Come on, this way. Elevator... I told you they're all out of order. It's going down. - Huh? What the...? - Six-one, come in, please. Contacted the elevator company. The van was reported stolen. They didn't send us anyone. - Who are you? - I told you. Look, there must be some kind of misunderstanding. One of the express elevators is coming down. - Lock her up! - What? Get that off! Bravo 6, come in, please. Bravo 6. Movement on the 29th floor. Someone's riding one of the express elevators. Move out! Come on, guys, give me a break. Look out, Libyans! Fuck! - Oh, jeez. - Relax, I was joking. No. Oh, come on. No, what are you doing? Come on, sir, please. Just" Damn! What's happening? Who's riding that elevator? - We don't know. - It's going up again. - I thought all power was cut. - It was. Take up top. Fuck. Someone turned the power on. What are you talking about? Who turned on the power? I don't know. Probably the same guys that are in the shaft right now. Don't tell me we got terrorists inside the building at this moment. It's stopped on the 62nd floor. Get a unit up there, on the double! Come on, guys, move it! Hey, hey, what...? Whoa, hell! - Jeez! Let's get the fuck out of here! Come on, you guys! Move, move, move! - Set. - Clear.

ID, hand it over. All right. Sorry, sir. Go ahead. Let him through. Move it! Let's see it! Look alive! Bravo 10, negative. I can't see a thing because of the smoke. - Secure the area, Sergeant. - Roger. Well, they got in. That's clear. What about this sewer system? Whoa, excuse me, excuse me, sir. Can I see some ID, please? Well, I'll be damned. Bravo One, come in, please. Bravo One. Who was that you just checked? Subject's name is Steinberg. He had a federal authorization code red. - Code red? - Yes, sir. Is something wrong? No, no, you did the right thing. Maybe we're not dealing with terrorists. I hope to hell we are. - Bravo 9 here. - What is it? Captain, we got a situation here. One of our stingers is missing. - Did you say "missing"? - Affirmative, sir. The freight elevator just stopped on 65. I'm going up there. Come on! Who the fuck is using that elevator? Please... put it down. I said, put it down. Stop it! Put your hands up. Don't be crazy. You're such a little girl. You're not going to shoot me. Give me the gun. I mean it! You okay? Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. What are you doing? I got him covered. It's not for him. You can't.

Put the gun down, Gunther. Enough people have died. Who are you? I don't know you. It's over, Gunther. Just drop the gun. Mark! Stand down. Give them some space. Smile. Nice one. Thank you, guys, for everything. - It was a pleasure. - Take it easy, okay? Yeah, I will. I'll send you both a print. Great, thanks. I want the negative. Sounds like your way of life. No, just a cautious man. You still don't trust me, and I never once mentioned the fucking chips, did I? Yeah, well, they wouldn't believe that story anyway, would they? Terrorists make a good read, too, you know. Oh, yeah? Really? Like "Tower of Death," the great headline? Yeah, well, that's what Russell thought. He promoted me to head of Sleaze Affairs. Ah, well, you must be real happy about that now, huh? I am. So, what are you going to do now'? Find a real job. This elevator thing is definitely not my style. You know, I'm not too keen on heights either, so it doesn't help. What ha--? What happened? Oh, my... You pressed the emergency button. What--what are you doing? This has been on my mind for a while. Are you sure you want to do this? You can trust me. I won't let you down.
