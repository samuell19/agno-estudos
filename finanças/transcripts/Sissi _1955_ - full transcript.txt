Good morning, Highness! Good morning! My God! I caught one, look how big it is! Children, come here, I caught one! Daddy caught a fish! -Iet's go to the lake! -Daddy caught a fish! Look! It's very big! Come quickly! Quickly, look what big fish it is, isn't it? -It must weight about five kilos! -Mammy, Daddy caught a fish! Yes, like this! Congratulations! One must hold the rod? Be quiet. Gackl shall hold it. I must go and bring the net! Gackl! -Daddy, Gackl fell into the water! -That's all that was needed! -Did you get the rod? -Yes, but the fish escaped! Then let us have breakfast! -Don't shout! -Wow! Today we have white sausage! Climb not on the table! Max, take off your hat! Did you left enough for me? 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. That's all right. Gackl! You look like a wet mouse! And you too! Thomas, change the princes' clothes. Yes, dry the princes! -I also want! -Then, eat! -Max, you are eating like a woodcutter! -Because it's delicious! You should be the example for them. -They are eating like me! -Yes... unfortunately. -Where is Sissy? -She is riding! -And Nene? -She never eats white sausage! -Well, then we have enough. -Daddy, can we go to bowl? Yes, you can! Someone is knocking, knocking, knocking. Nobody used knife and fork. Why not? Because you always use your fingers! Look, my sweetheart. Since 5 years you're trying to educate me... I'm taking care that our home don't become a roughhouse! I'm worried about the future. We've 5 daughters. Helena is ready for marriage. -Who is coming? -Mr. Johann Petzmacher. -Let him in! -The son of a barkeeper! I kiss your hand, Highness. Good morning! -Salve, Max! -Salve. -When did you arrive? -Last night! And only now you come? Where are you being accommodated? At the Post Office! All the morning I was assisting how he is tele... how they call this new innovation? I remember! how he telegraphed. It's very interesting, we also were assisting. It's incredible, he's knocking on the table... -and Munich listening! -That's nothing. I also can telegraph. Thomas! At your disposal, Highness! -What did you telegraph? -Bring light red wine! -What the news from Vienna? -Nothing, only... the attack against the Emperor. The government gentlemen are still... shaking like a leaf, the only "man" at the Hofburg is Sofia! When they say Sofia, then they mean the mother of The Majesty... The Imperial Highness, the Archduchess Sofia? Exactly. Now, Sofia... your imperial sister... want to arrange marriage for her son Francis, sorry... Your Emperor... this is, Our Emperor... she wants to get married him. -It's known with whom? -There are no comments. Oh, vintage 49! Fantastic. If you don't like that, you will like none! I like any wine. Let's toast to your Sofia! I can't stand her... but if she will be the reason for drinking, let us toast! To the future Empress Of Austria too! To your health, Max! -Was that Sissy! -Surely, mounting that wild horse! -Sissy! -Good morning! -Jump over the roses! -No! Stop! Use the crampon! -Bravo! -That's why I'm always nervous. Great girl! Mittermeier! I'm here, Princess! Gretl jumped over very well? Marvelous, you have must seen! Like a gazelle fleeing! -Today she will get more oatmeal. -She will deserve it! -Where is the bird food? -I put it there! -Thank you! -Come, Gretl. Come! -The milk for Xavier. -How is he? Very well, but he accepts nothing from anyone, only from you! Sure, I found him. Xavier, come. Come to eat. Barri, Bella, go out! In the corner! Let Xavier eat! Push him. Push him. Bravo! You must defend yourself, Xavier! Push him! Defend yourself! Push him! You three go to the corner! Go! Come, Xavier! Come! Now you are looking, don't you? Is it delicious, Xavier? -Good morning, Princess! -Good morning, Mrs. St?ckl! -How is your gout? -It'll rain, I'm feeling in my fingers! -I'll bring more French ardent spirit! -Only for massaging! She always drinks the French ardent spirit! -It's not true, never I did that! -Yes... Good morning, Daddy! -Good morning! -Look! -Beautiful... -How he looks interested to the dogs. -Quiet! You too, Bella! -You mounted and jumped very well. As recompense, you can go with me to the Bock! Really? -What's the problem, Baroness? -This letter arrived now, Highness. A letter for me? From the Hofburg? That's marvelous! Call the Princess Nene, immediately. Wonderful! -Did you call me, Mama? -Yes, my daughter! Nene... I'm receiving a letter from your aunt Sofia... -She wrote about you! -About me? Yes. Don't comment anything, mainly with your father. Aunt Sofia asked explicitly! The notice is only for us -What did write aunt Sofia? -She wrote... Mami! -Mami! -Yes? -Daddy will go hunt with me! -Do you must shout so? -Well, what did write aunt Sofia? -She is awaiting us in Ischl... on August, 1 7... My God... I can't believe. -What? -You should be the Empress of Austria! -I? -Yes! Imagine what happiness! Francis Joseph is charming, powerful, rich! The whole world will envy you. Barri! -Mammy! Mammy! -What's the matter? -Is Nene with you? -Yes! -Will Nene come with us! -Nene has no time. Go alone! -Yes let us go. Kisses! -Yes! -A kiss. -But, mammy... what will say father when we are going to Ischl alone? I also think about that. What we can do? Maybe it will better carry Sissy with us... this way it will seem a trip. Oh, Nene, I'm so happy! I'm too, but I still understood. At Innsbruck, Francis Joseph only directed a few words to me. He was thinking about other things, the revolution, the retreat from Vienna... the fight for the throne! The most important is that... aunt Sofia wants this marriage. What she wants, is a consummated fact! Your Majesty! -I kiss your hand, Mother! -Salutations. I want to be alone with His Majesty. -Do you have a moment for me? -For you always, Mother! -Later. -At your disposal, Majesty! Well, dear Mother. I'm at your disposal. Not at your working desk. What I want to say is of private nature. Let's sit down there. It's a pleasure, Mother. You know that I always have done everything for your welfare. -Of course, Mother. -Even I abdicated to the throne... I've brought back to Austria its Emperor... Now I wish to put in the arms of this Emperor an honorable spouse... -Shall I marry? -Yes, Francis. Almost all countries have princesses in marriage age. Many potencies are sounding. For political reasons... -I refused anyone. -I don't know whom I shall marry. Therefore, I already decided. A decision that doesn't offend nor favor any country. Dear mother, I always was grateful for each suggestion and initiative... but don't you believe that in this case the decision must be mine? Of course. But you can trust me. The young lady which will be your spouse and... Empress has all attributes what you want. She is young, beautiful and coming from a catholic house... -However I don't know her... -You know her! You have seen her in Innsbruck. She's your cousin Helena... daughter of aunt Ludovica and... well, the only inglorious point... Archduke Max from Bavaria. We must consider this. Incredible... he is the only one of the whole family that I remember. And very well! Beautiful, isn't it? Marvelous! Remember one thing, my daughter: Whenever you've problems or be worried, be walking through the forest with... wide open eyes. In each tree, in each bush, in each flower and animal... you will feel the power of God and He will give you comfort and energy. I'm very happy to have a father like you. I'm very happy to have a daughter like you... I shouldn't say this... but now, shut up, otherwise we frighten the hunt. -I'm with my heart in my mouth. -Silent. What you bring, Excellence? The death sentence for eight rebels of Prague. -What people are these? -Students, academics and... -artists. -Are their crimes so serious... -to justify that condemnation? -Yes, Majesty. Rebellion, subversion and offense of Your Majesty. -I'll analyze the records. -I need your signature urgently. -The executions will be tomorrow. -I can't decide about... -the life of eight young peoples! -Majesty... the condemnations were pronounced by the major council of war. lt doesn't matter. I'll analyze the records. Also Your Imperial Majesty, the Archdukes Sofia is convinced that... I think I have expressed my opinion... -Majesty? -Thank you, Excellence. Keep attention now. We will prepare the bed... and now we'll put him here. He must sleep. Seppl! Give back the doll! Go and bring another doll. -Present arms! -What are you doing with my hat? It's not a toy. Put it on its place! If I need it, I couldn't find it! -What is that? -The Castle of Nymphenburg! Poor royal family... As summer residence it will serve. Now I'll show you something. Let us wrap up Hansi. So, so, you must cover the belly to not catch a cold. Cover him, put him into the sleeping bag and tie it up... -Did we get one more baby? -But, Max... Fasten well so it that cannot open. Now you will try it alone. Later Mammy will come back to look about him. Go away. -What did Sofia write? -She invited me for the birthday... of Francis Joseph in Ischl. I would like to go with Nene and... -Sissy. -I can come with you? -Yes, you can. -Carl Ludwig will be there? Of course. It's the birthday of his brother. It seems that Carl Ludwig still stays in your head. -Use the ring that he sent you. -Where is it? -In the needle box. -No, in my feather box. Oh, what a mess. Something urgently I can telegraph. Not to me, 'cause the postal clerk'll wake me up in the middle of the night. Telegraph to Petzmacher. He resides in the post office with the Bazi... -the dirty rat. -Then I'll telegraph to the Bazi, the dirty rat. -When will we go? -Tomorrow morning. So soon? Excellent! Once His Majesty will be in Ischl, the personnel control will be rigorous. Rigorous control! Another offense must to be hindered anyhow! In any way! Highness, I know the responsibility on my shoulders... from now on... pardon... on my shoulder. But you can trust me completely. Safety of a Sovereign... -is my specialty! -Did you make this some time? Never! But theoretically I know the strategy. -Can I sleep calmly? -Of course. I wish you a good rest. -You can go. -Where? Imperial Highness, Police Major leaving! My God, Sissy! What are you doing? -I'm giving water to the horses! -This is the coaches' driver function. -Look how are you! -The sun will dry it in one moment! I wish I could send you back home. Aunt Sofia is coming! -Ludovica! -Sofia! -I'm being very delighted! -I'm too. -I kiss your hand, aunt. -Carl Ludwig! Nene. -She becomes more beautiful! -Salutations, Carl-Ludwig! -I'm being very pleased. -Look there, Sissy! -You brought Sissy? -Later I'll explain why. -Good afternoon, aunt Sofia. -Salutations, my child. -Your hands are wet! -I gave water to the horses! -You'd given water the horses? -To be more quickly! -Hello, Carl-Ludwig! -Sissy, what kind of greeting. I learned it from him. At Innsbruck we always said "Hello". Isn't it? Of course. I'm happy that you came. And I for being here! Your Austria is beautiful! -You like it? -Very much! I can't understand why this young lady came too! -Why... -Her mother will explain. She'll not participate of the reception, she will stay with the governess... rigorously separated from the society. Of course. She is a child. -Sissy, did you remember me? -Of course. Look! You can't imagine how I'm happy to see you with my ring... -Do you also use mine? -Never I let to use! -How gentle! -If you don't come to Ischl... I shall go to Possenhofen. I was only awaiting the engagement. -Engagement? -It's still a secret! Tell me, why uncle Max didn't come? Here we have a very good hunting area! Chamois, deer, mountain goats! -I'll write him to come. -Telegraph! It's more quickly! -It will be a surprise! -My mother is entering the coach. -We must go. -We're going! -Are we seeing us soon? -Of course! Therefore, streets, roads, by-paths bridges, etc. that conduct to Ischl... must being controlled rigorously! Understood? Anyone suspected or renitent... put it immediately on ice. -That is, in irons! -Yes, Sir! "Better arrest one in excess, than release an innocent"! Retire...! Baroness, and my basket? I put it into the bag! -Into the clothes bag? -Yes. -Princess, the dresses... -It must be there, dear. Very well. We must still go better dressed to the ball. -Are we going to a ball? -You not! -Why not? I can dance! -You are still a child. -Where is my Venetian shawl? -Sissy, do you like my coiffure? It's good. The hair must be higher! Like this! Sissy! What are you doing? We must go to aunt Sofia for the five-o'clock tea! -What should I dress? -Nothing. I mean, you wasn't been invited! -Then I'll go fishing! -My God, the coiffure! Please, do arrange it! -Here is it! -Sissy, what are you doing now? -I want my basket! -Go to your room immediately... -otherwise I'll get crazy... -My fishing rod! -Your rod! Come in! You're terrible! -Don't arrest me, I want go fishing! No! From her you don't go out! It's knocking, knocking... Why I brought this child? Can you tell me where is the Post Office? -Post Office. -Straight away, straight away! Straight away... thank you! Stop! What did you speak with the girl? What did you tell her?! -Nothing! -Nothing? You've made an indication! Indicate, yes I indicated! What did you indicate? What and why you did? -The lady asked for an information! -What did she ask? What? -Where is the next Post Office. -The next Post Office! Must I pull out the information from your nose? Go! Go away! Well. Please! -Very well. -May can I assist? Of course. Mr. Johann Petzmacher... Possenhofen. It's in Bavaria, isn't it? Yes, by the Starnberg Lake. Post Office. Was arrested... escaped through the window. Send quickly... -Petzmacher could read this? -They're writing on paper. Papili, come with guns. The Emperor arrives today at four o'clock. Sissy. -This means Sissy? -Yes. -Did you invent this apparatus? -No, it was Mister Morse... and Mr. Carl von Siemens constructed it. -Well, thank you. -You're welcome. -Good bye! -Just a moment! You must pay! Oh, yes? -But I don't have money. -You let me telegraph? Look, I'll bring you the money later. In the meantime, stay with this ring. -It's pure gold? -I don't know, I think it is. -Don't bite! I need it! -0 words... That is 60 crusaders. 60? Do you think that it is of this value! -Do you think so? -Yes, I do. Very well, later on bring me the money. -Yes. -Greetings. My greetings too. -Salutations, B?ckl. -Without intimacy! I'm on service. What did the person who just went out telegraph? Where it's starting? I can't read this, these are only points and traces. -Here, read it. -"Was arrested". A fugitive. -Like I suspected... -What do you telegraph? -Who? -You! Remove it! "Escaped through the window". -Did she do something wrong? -Shut up! It's I who asks! "Escaped through the window". Who is telegraphing? It's the Gmundner asking who telegraphed. I'll answer immediately. -Did you answer who telegraphed? -Yes. A fool. -You can't speak so, I'm on service! -I'm too! Pardon. "Send Papili". Who is Papili? It's a Croatian name. "With guns"! This is an attack against the Emperor! An attack against the Emperor! I know... It can be only this! She is on the street where the Emperor must pass! My helmet! -Something particular? -I cannot spend time with that! How I can get my money? The girl doesn't have money and... -gave me this ring as guarantee! -What? You accepted? You're a receiver! -What am I? -Receiver! It must have been stolen! -Devolve it! -It shall stay with the police! You know, B?ckl? When you're on service, you're a dumbbell! Now that? Offending authority! Stand up. You can considering you prisoner! I'll pick you up later! Where is the "idiot"? I'll take it... with me as "corpus... delicti"! Why the horses are rebellious? -It's a knapsack! -Well, put it away! What is this? Who is fishing there? It's me! Oh, Majesty! Please, don't cut! I'm coming! Please, don't cut! Majesty, I'll release you in no time! For the sake of God, Majesty! Give me the knife! Give me... Majesty, I guess I'm on the heels of a nihilist... -I'm following her some time! -The knapsack! -In this knapsack would be a bomb. -Then take it! Majesty, he is crazy, I'm not a nihilist. I believe you. You're not an Austrian. -No, I'm from... Bavaria! -From Bavaria? Earl Gr?nne? Please, go forward and inform my mother that I'll walk for a while. -At your disposal, Majesty! -Would you come with me... -if you have time. -Oh, yes. I have! Let's extend our walk and admire the beauty of Ischl. -I only will look for my rod. -As an humble servant I ask you... -to pay attention! -Yes, yes! -Can l? -Of course! Could you fish something with that? Yes, you, Majesty. I must say, you're the first delightful surprise what I had in Ischl. -This makes me happy. -How long you'll stay here? -I'd like to see you once more. -Two or three days. What a pity. In the next two, three days I'll not have time available. Wait... I reserved some time. Do you accept to go hunting this afternoon? Yes. I go always hunting with Papili. -Papili? -He is my father. -He is also a hunter, the Papili? -A great hunter... -the best I've ever known! -That is fine. Tell me, is it the first time you came to Austria, Nene? -No! We were together in Tyrol. -Yes, three years ago, in Innsbruck. That one time when, we go out running... -that was a very nice time. -Do you want more tea? No. Please, an liquor. Your Imperial Highness wants a liquor. Highness, the coach of His Majesty is coming into the park. Yes? Then let us go to the balcony to salute Francis Joseph! -Carl-Ludwig! -Yes, Mother! What happens? Everybody is running out? The coach of His Majesty came into the park! Give me one more liquor! Highness, General Adjutant of His Majesty presenting him! -Where is His Majesty? -He ordered to go ahead. -He wanted to walk. -Yes? Yes. That is, no. That is... -His Majesty was accompanied. -Accompanied? A lady, l didn't know her! -Unknown by you? -Yes, Highness! Thank you. Come, my dears! That one is the "Dachstein". There is my hunting area. That mountain. There is the "H?llengebirge". And there is the Mount Jainsen. -It's beautiful. -All right... then at five o'clock, punctually, at the "Hirschenbr?cke"? -Yes, Majesty. -Shall you find the way? -Surely! -I hope you'll not get lost. I? Impossible! Even if the forest shall be unknown. Now may I can ask you a favor. Talk with the Police Major so he cannot follow me once again! -All right! Then? At 5? -Good Bye, Majesty! -Can I get my knapsack? -May I can ask for some information? -Yes? -Just a moment! I have some queries... -Mister Major! -Majesty? First my queries. Tell me, how was the weather the last days in Ischl? It was wonderful, Majesty. Pardon, I must follow the lady! -She's winking! She's winking! -Let her wink! She called my attention immediately. Mine too. Tell me, Mister Major... -I want to know how'll be the weather. -Terrible, in the next days... -we'll have torrential rain. -Do you have a frog? No, rheumatism! I'm weather feeling two days before! She had gone... as if the earth has absorbed her! -Tell me what you want from the lady. -Know her name and her address. Why didn't you say that earlier? Run! In form me immediately! Did you sleep well, Princess? -Why do you think that I was sleeping? -The room was so silent... I won't to disturb. I wasn't sleeping. I was dreaming. I'm curious. What do Mother and Nene tell about the reception? Were there many people? How will look the Emperor? -Charming! -What? I guess he must be lovely, as seen on the pictures... Of course, I want to know if he is different since Innsbruck! -Completely. -What? -At that time we all were children. -Yes, you are certain! Baroness, at five my room will be silent again. It would be very gentle if you shall not disturb. -I kiss your hand, Mother. -Salute, Francis! -My salutations, Father! -Salve, Francis! -I'm happy finally see you! -I'm too. You're being well recovered! -What do you say? -You are being well recovered! Really, I'm fine! I always say that I do all, except govern. Francis... Aunt Ludovica and your cousin Nene came from Possenhofen... to commemorate your birthday! Dear aunt, it's pleasant that you came from Ischl. The pleasure is our, dear Francis. My salutations, Nene. Hardly I can recognize you. Some years had passed since we've seen us in Innsbruck. -Yes, you became very beautiful. -Thank you. -Uncle Max didn't come? -Unfortunately. He asked to transmit you the best wishes for a happy birthday. -What a pity. -He wants to do that personally... but he had to resolve topics non-postponable. This round was great! Max! I received a telegram from Ischl, from Sissy! -From Sissi? - Sissi telegraphed? -What did she telegraph? -She's arrested, escaped by the window. Go to Ischl and bring guns. Wow! We'll going to Ischl! Hurrah! Hurrah! Quiet! What shall I do in Ischl? They don't see that I'm occupied? Boys, pick up the bowling sticks and ask Thomas... where is the beer. You, mark the strike I've done! -And you shall bowl with us! -Daddy, please... Disappear! I'll stay at home! The first time I can do what I want... and now I should travel? Never! -What? You don't know who is the girl? -No. I only know she's beautiful! An unknown lady made the Emperor from Austria to leave his coach and... walk down the streets like a simple student! Just at the day where your future fianc? is awaiting you. I'm sorry having left you so angry about this matter. Nothing worried more than let you angry. -Please, forgive me. -It's all right. Let us forget this unpleasant event! We'll no more speak about this matter! What you think about Nene? -I think she's very... very pretty. -Pretty? I think she's beautiful! -And you, daughter, did you like him? -He's very nice! Nice? He's charming! -I think Nene is a little cool. -My God, she is a little shy. -She knows what is waiting for her! -She knows that we'll become engaged? Of course. But this shouldn't influence your decision. I talked with Nene. She is intelligent, devote, well educated, refined... and with her visual, predestined to be the spouse of a sovereign. -Yes, sure. But... -Say nothing yet. You must know her better and then you'll have the same opinion like mine. -Come to talk with her. -Not yet. I'll go hunting. -You'll hunt still today? -It's the only opportunity! -I'll stay here only two days! -Reserve one hour for the guests. It's not possible. It's almost 5 o'clock. I made a date with the hunters. And you know that I'd like to be punctual. Later on, at the dinner... and the ball, I'll have a chance to better know Helene. However it may be. -From here on I'll go alone. -The loading man should come with you. -Nobody, the dog also stays here! -Good luck, Majesty! -Good luck. -Good luck! Salutations, Majesty! Oh, pardon. -Was I punctual? -How wonderful that you came! -It's delightful to walk in the forest. -The path is arduous! -It doesn't matter. -Then let's go! His Majesty was going to hunt? That wasn't been previewed! -You can't speak so loudly! -Pardon. How can l... execute the right steps of security? We must consider also facts not projected. The lady that His Majesty met when he arrived... -was not previewed too! -About her I want to talk! -He knows her? -Certainly, he walked... -with her for a while. -Do you know her?! I? Yes, madam. That means, no. l know her, but I'm sure she is a thief. -A thief? -Yes. Now I only must discover... if she is a simple thief. Political criminals are habituated to commit simple law-breaking... -to confuse the authorities. -No lesson about criminology. -I want know if she had be indicted! -Unfortunately, not yet. -And why not? -Because she escaped. -And why? -A funny question! Pardon, Imperial Highness, it slipped out. She escaped because His Majesty didn't let escape me... that means, His Majesty involved me in a conversation. And you said that I could sleep calm! -Pardon, who? -You! I again?! It's nice that Your Majesty loves the forest as I do. But only occasionally I'm walking in the forest. Normally... I'm sitting at my working table... -or passing in review. -Then you are worthy of compassion! If you have problems or be worried, be walking through the forest with... wide open eyes. In each tree, in each bush... in each flower and animal, you'll feel the power of God and... He will give you comfort and energy. -Did you read that in some book? -No, it's a suggestion from my Papili. Oh, Papili! He must be a wonderful person, the Papili! And how! But now we must be in silent. We must be very quiet... otherwise we astonish the hunt! Here is a hunter "par excellence"! -Therefore, silence! -Yes. -Majesty? -Yes? -Do you intend to kill the deer? -Of course. For what the gun? -Papili don't fire? -Yes. But-I like to observe... -the living animals. -I'm too. Today I want a deer. -Look there! -Where? There! -He ran away! -Pardon, Majesty! How could this occur with a hunter? I don't know. Please, don't be annoyed. -No, I'll still get him. -But not today? Not today. Now we can speak louder. We even can sing loudly! I don't believe! You brought a cithara with you? Yes, Daddy carried one to Egypt, to the Queops Pyramid! Papili already had been in Egypt? Suddenly he wish to travel and he goes... and, I think so someday, I'll be like him! I regret that you stay only two, three days, I'd like to extend my vacation. Because of me? That's very gentle! -Tell me something about you. -About me? There isn't much to tell! -Favorite activity: to ride! -Mine too! -Favorite flowers: red roses. -Mine too. -Favorite dessert: Apfelstrudel! -I can't believe! Also mine! Really? -And your name? -At home, Liesl von Possenhofen. Possenhofen? At the Starnberg Lake! Where's living the Archduke Max of Bavaria! Then you know my cousins Helena, Elisabeth, Mathilde! Maria, Sofia! Also the boys, that is, the Princes... Gackl, Carl-Theodor. As l know, the Archdukes Ludovica... came to Ischl with the princesses Helena and Sissy, didn't she? They came to salute me for my birthday! -But the Princess Sissy didn't come! -Of course, she did! -You don't know her? -Superficially. -And then, you like her? -Insignificant, but Liesl... pleased me! Never I could think that I may envy someone. -Yes? Whom? -The man that becomes married with her! -But why you do think so now? -It's a very logical thinking. -Are you thinking to become married? -Unfortunately I must. -That means that you're engaged? -Not yet. -Only in love? -Neither. I'll become engaged this night. But how can someone become engaged without love? In our circle it's usual... due to state concerns... dynasty reasons, due to... She should be like this... these eyes... this mouth... these hairs... -she should be beautiful as you. -Your fianc? isn't beautiful? Of course, she is very beautiful... But... But not so much! -I guess you've more heart! -Who she's? A princess, Of course. -Maybe I know her. -Certainly, you do. -Yes? -Princess Helena from Bavaria. Nene? Don't let us speak about me... I'm happy that I met you. I guess that you could be very beloved. That means, you must be beloved. -Liesl! -Please, not. What happens? Suddenly, you're transformed? -Liesl, what's happening? -Nothing! Liesl! Liesl! Please, stop! Liesl! -Do you know what aunt Sofia said? -What? You educated Nene to be an Empress. Hello, Sissy. From where are you coming? I was walking in the forest. Mother, can we tell Sissy now why we are here? Of course we can. Sissy, a great new! Today I'll become the fianc? of Francis Joseph. You can't believe how happy I'm. He's charming, different from the pictures. He's attractive and gentle! I'm content with your happiness, Nene. Sissy! Sissy, what happens with you? You're so different, you're not feeling well? -What's the trouble? -Nothing. You're sad because you didn't be invited? I've good news for you. Prince Khevenh?ller came without advising and he needs a lady at table. For this reason aunt Sofia invited you. Well? No, Mother. I would not go. I'll stay at home. This isn't possible. Aunt Sofia shall be offended, if you wouldn't accept. -Yes! -It doesn't matter! I'm not going. Please, don't annoy me. Don't be ill-tempered. Any other princess would be happy to partake of this dinner. But I'll stay at home! -What's the matter with her? -I've no idea. But she'll go. That's all that I needed, displease aunt Sofia. Just that night, which can signify the destiny of our lineage. Good Evening, Excellence! Your Highness, Field Marshal, Prince Radetzky. I'm delighted, in spite of the long way, that you were coming to visit me. It's a great honor and deference for me... to partake of these birthday festivities of Your Majesty. Her Majesty, the Queen of Prussia! Welcome, dear aunt! -I'm delighted with your visit. -I'm also to can... transmit, personally, my greetings for a happy birthday. Her Majesty, the Queen of Saxon. Welcome, dear aunt! -I'm delighted with your visit. -I'm also to can... transmit, personally, my greetings for a happy birthday. Your Highness, Archdukes Ludovica of Bavaria. Princess Helena of Bavaria. Princess Elisabeth of Bavaria. Welcome, dear aunt. Welcome, Nene! Welcome... Elisabeth! -You know each other! -How? -From Innsbruck. -Yes! I'm happy to review you... Liesl von Possenhofen. Salutations. Let's go, my child! Salutations, my child. Francis? -Accompany Nene to the table. -Yes, Mother. I don't believe. I couldn't recognize Sissy. In Innsbruck, she was an insignificant child. And now she's the lady more fascinating I've ever seen! -Pardon, Nene, don't be annoyed. -Why I should? It's not elegant be delirious with a lady, beside my partner at table. Sissy is my sister! I also find her fascinating. -Each day more beautiful! -Yes, really fascinating! What a pity that Max didn't come. I like him very much. -I'll tell him. -What? -I'll tell him! -Stomach problem? Oh, no! -What's happen? -Max has stomach problem. I also suffer with that. -Oh? -He's too fat? You put him on a diet! Oh, bravo! May can I register me in your feuilleton? -It's a pleasure. -How many dances you'll grant me? As much you want. -Also the Cotillon? -Yes. -What are your favorite flowers? -Favorite flowers? -What? -The favorite flower for your bouquet. Oh, well! -Red roses -Red roses... -But I described her with details. -We couldn't find her, Major! Ways, by-path, streets and bridges are being controlled. The houses were been examined. Where is she? Maybe she'll appear at the torch parade. Oh yes, she'll come into your arms with festive illumination. -Or tomorrow in the church? -Terrorists don't go to church. She'll appear for the next attack, and that will break my neck! He is laughing! He laughs... Retire! Retire! What impertinence! Incredible! Cotillon! -Excuse me, Francis. -Surely. -Please, Archdukes. -Thank you, Excellence. That means that Nene will be the future Empress of Austria? -Why you think so? -With two queens present... Francis Joseph sitting beside a princess this will signify something. I'm surprised that you keep secret in the presence of your sisters. -Nene is fascinating. -She is not for you. And why not? -Don't hunt in the imperial sanctuary. -It's that? Imperial Highness, your chamomile tea. -Do you put cognac? -Yes, Imperial Highness! Thank you. Why you're smelling your tea? Proving if it isn't too strong. For you being aware about, Francis Joseph will be engaged with Nene today. -Speak louder! -I can't shout! -Francis will become engaged with Nene. -Bravo! Are they in love? -No, but this shall come later. -Bravo! Why they'll become engaged? We also have being engaged without love. It was be decided by the Congress. -Yes! Today, I decide. -Bravo! Stop saying bravo! You aren't in a circus! -What happened? -Nothing, all is well. Bravo! -Become not annoyed, I'll stop dancing. -Why? -I'm not feeling well. -Let us go to the garden... -fresh air will do well. -No. Let me alone. -May I can go with you? -Please, not! What happened, Sissy? -Why did you run away this afternoon? -Must I explain? I guess the destiny decided to act different as the mothers did. It can't be a simple chance... our encounter today, far away from the oppression of the Court. -I think it's all well. -What is well? My mother wants me to become engaged with a daughter of Aunt Ludovica. This is the wish of my mother never I'll let not attend her. Sissy... I love you. Do you accept to be my spouse? -No, never! -And why not? I don't want to perturb the happiness of Nene! Never I'll take off her spouse! Be reasonable! You aren't taking off Nene's spouse. I'm not her spouse. You don't perturb her happiness because I guess that it... will be happiness marry me. I'm the Emperor from Austria... Master of a powerful country, but danger is at all place. The rebels at Milan, the rebellion in Hungary. I assume my duties with sobriety, Sissy. I'll not have much time for my spouse! Even so, I'll be very happy with a spouse by my side... like you. You remember not what I said today... without knowing who you're? So she must be... have these eyes... -this mouth... -Please, stop speaking... otherwise I'll forget the etiquette and run away! Do you think that Francis is giving attention enough to Nene? Francis always opens the Cotillon. Certainly he'll open it with her. Don't worry, all is going as I want! I trust you! Sissy... Would you help me to carry this heavy duty? -And if Nene doesn't exist? -She exists and I love Nene. In no way, I could hurt her. She loves you, she told me! Francis? -Yes, Mother? -I would like to talk with you! Of course, Mother. Excuse me, Sissy! -You looked wonderful! -Really? You are being observed by everyone. Certainly they know what's happening. -I noted. -Aunt Sofia said... -What? -That Francis Joseph will dance... -The Cotillon with you. -I imagined. At that time, the engagement will be announced! I'm so happy! Well, Francis, it's time to make official your engagement... Therefore I would like to know your decision. -Yes, Mother. I made my decision. -Well! May I can make it official? At last, everybody is supposing that you'll become engaged with Nene! Mother, my decision didn't affect Nene... but Sissy! Sissy? -Did you know what you're saying? -Of course, mother! But, Francis! You can't marry a 16 old girl, ill-mannered... Sissy shall be an Empress... as the world never has seen before. -In the bad meaning! -In the best meaning! She's the proper fascination. Her charm is so delicate... never I've seen. Sissy is a treasure... and I'll not permit that someone takes it away from me. I've made up my decision: Or with Sissy or with nobody! In my name, Mother, propose marriage with Sissy to Aunt Ludovica. To Uncle Max, I'll propose it personally. You're putting me in front of a consummated fact? Unfortunately, Sissy will be in the same situation. I'm sorry, Mother. It's the first time we don't agree one with the other! Messieurs, choose the flowers for your ladies of the Cotillon! What's the matter with you, Sissy? Even in the afternoon, you're so sad. I don't want to see you that way. -Tell me, what's happening with you? -Nothing, Mother. -Then go dance. You're young! -I don't want to dance! Then be cheerful. Whom did you promise the Cotillon? -To Carl-Ludwig. -Well, then dance with him! -Red roses for me. -We don't have more red roses. His Majesty has reserved all them. -For who are the red roses? -For Sissy. Isn't she fascinating? -But not for you! -And why not? -Don't cross the way of the Emperor. -What you're saying? My eyes see more than yours! Pardon, I'm searching for Carl-Ludwig. I promised the Cotillon to him. That doesn't matter now. Come here. -Let me look at you! -Yes, aunt! Well... -You're not very tall! -Unfortunately not. But this comes from the family. Mother is not tall... and also you! I do want, in any case, that you treat me with intimacy. But you're my aunt! Francis Joseph is my son and treats me respectfully! Of course. If you... pardon, If she wants it that way... aunt, this is so unusual, so stupid! You'd adapt you to many things. At the Austrian Court predominates a rigorous ceremonial... the Spanish ceremonial that must be obeyed, in any situation. This is my will... and also the Emperor's will. What languages do you speak besides German? -English and French. -You should know Hungarian, Croatian... -and the language of Bohemian. -For what? Because Francis Joseph told me that he loves her and... -want you as his spouse. -I said... Please, don't interrupt me, while I'm speaking. Answer: do you love him too? -Please, don't ask me! -I claim an answer for my question. Yes, I love him. I love him very much. I asked... I was aware that you're mounting many hours per day. Nothing against cavalcades, it helps the silhouette. Now you must take care of your health. Your teeth are yellow, you must better brush them! I brush them! My teeth are white! Your boyish mode must change! Rather your life must change if you would be an Empress of Austria. -I won't be an Empress! -Consider yourself happy if you'll be! I always was happy at home. Maybe more than everybody here. In no way I'll change my life! I'll be free and without oppression! -What mode of speech is that? -The speech my father taught me! For who liberty and true are above all! I think that for the moment we've nothing do say each other. -Where're going? -Going home! Now? At the beginning of the Cotillon what I'm awaiting so much? -Excuse me, but I'll dance. -I don't let you go. -I claim my dance! -Neither I asking...? Majesty, the roses! Thank you! Sofia, our dream will be reality! -Sister, you're wrong! -Don't you see he's going to Nene? Dear Sissy, permit me to offer you your favorite flowers. He's giving flowers to Sissy? What does this mean? This means... that he'll not become engaged with Nene. Dear Nene, I asked you for the Cotillon. Please, permit that I... dance it with Sissy... my fianc?. -He wants to marry with Sissy? -Yes. To the life of the future Empress of Austria. Salve, salve, salve! Permit, Majesty, that in name of all the present invited guests... and as the oldest guest, l transmit greetings of happiness... for the engagement of Your Majesty and the Princess Elisabeth from Bavaria. -He transmits. -Thank you, My Field Marshal. Majesty... The people had organized fireworks display to pay homage to Your Majesty. That is very gentle. Sissy? My daughter, I feel sorry for you. Oh, Mother, why we did go to Ischl? What humiliation! l ask you, Nene, be strong and maintain your posture. -And believe, Sissy can't being blamed. -I know. Therefore, don't be annoyed with her. Nene, please, don't let appear what you're feeling... that you're being hurt. I ask you, please. I can't do that, mother! I can't! Why did you do that? Why did you put me into a situation of a consummated fact? I understood that you never should said yes! Ludovica, toast with your sisters. You bring also a sovereign to the family. -Why are you crying? -It's no reason to cry! Who is worthy for piety am l. I'm burden with the task to turn a countrywoman into an Empress! It's not necessary. Sissy will be an Empress. By my education. In one year you wouldn't recognize her. In one year who do recognize her no more, shall be you! -Then bravo! -Now it was you! But that is... That is... The fianc? of His Majesty. -Sir Mayor, I need a hole? -For what? Disappearing in it! Who is the next? Itisn?t the liver from a fi?sh It?s the liver from a cow! Taste the good wine From the future father-in-law! The liver isn?t from a pig It?s from a deer I don?t want more wine now I want cool beer! But Sissy, what's the matter with you? Sitting here sad and alone? You don't appear a happy fianc?. -Do you have news from Nene? -Of course. She is staying with aunt Elisabeth in Potsdam. She's very well. She's known the Prince Thurn and Taxis and she like him very much... he's courting her... But she doesn't come back... because she didn't forgive me that I've destroyed her life! Sissy, please... Now, listen to me! You didn't destroy her life... all happened as it has to happen. Aunt Sofia would represent the destiny and this isn't possible. Francis Joseph loves you more than Nene! You're happy! He loves you with all his heart. You do too, doesn't you? And that is of importance! I'll not be happy while Nene is annoyed with me and do not come home. -What? In the middle of the night? -What happens? -A royal messenger! -What he wants? I don't know. Don't bother. I'll be back soon. Drink to my health! Salute to our host Urdear Dutch Max! -Count Arco, what surprise! -Excuse me to disturb so late... -it wasn't possible come earlier. -Salutations. Came into the tempest? I came by solicitation of His Majesty, the King Maximilian... from Bavaria, to transmit to you and your family... -the best felicitations. -It is very kind from... His Majesty sending felicitations through a special messenger. Good evening. -There is one more special message. -Yes? Unfortunately not the best. His Majesty asked me to remember Your Royal Highness... that he is no more a private person... but... finally... you became a public person... -In other words? -His Majesty will that... Your Royal Highness, from now on... how can I say? leads a life a little more moderated. Transmit that I wish, that my spouse continues as he always was! -But Royal Highness! -Until today we were happy and... content! Nobody did worry about us... nor the King. Leave us alone! Oh, Vicky! You're an extraordinary woman! Please, Count. If I weren't married with you, I should marry you now. Excuse me! Count Arco, inform His Majesty about this family idyll... we're sending our regards and all will continue as always! If he doesn't like it, he'll communicate, I'll become Austrian... But, please, Highnesses... Francis will do that with great pleasure. Come, Xavier. Let us go to the forest! Come. Be carefully that nothing happens to you. The time you'll be a man, keep away from father's way! -Who must go out from my way? -Xavier. But Sissy... What you doing? I'll give liberty to my animals, once I must abdicate to my liberty. What strange things are you saying? Any princess would be happy being in your place... and you keep a straight face...! Listen, I received a notice. The marriage was be set to April, 4. On April, 0 you'll go down the Danube, with a ship. Nene! I can't believe, what lovely surprise! The Prince Thurn and Taxis brought me. He'll salute you. I'm being delighted to welcome you! -The pleasure is mine, Duchess! -Thank you. What happens? You're acting as if you're another person! -Maybe you don't love Francis? -Yes, I love him, even too much! But I'm afraid of Aunt Sofia and all that court ceremonial... I understand! I always was frighten about that! Will you know something? When they are annoying you in Vienna, with all that nonsense... you'll come here and we'll walk into the forest. No! Now Francis must accompany you. -Sissy will being frightened! -Where is she? With the animals! Sissy! Nene is here! Come! Nene was coming! -Nene! -Sissy! I only wish to tell you that we'll be always the same... I wish you'll be so happy as I am! It's good that you're speaking so, Nene! I'm so happy! I never would feel happy. Your new fatherland is a beautiful country, Sissy! I guess I'm dreaming! The ship! She is coming! -Sissy! -Francis! Tell me what are you searching here? Good morning, aunt! I'm following you through several rooms. You're going from window to window! What's missing? Can't you sleep? -No, I'm looking for the animals. -What animals? Francis Joseph told me that he has a big park. This is the reason why you go so restless, in nightdress and peignoir? -Loose hanging hairs and barefoot? -Nobody has seen me! -Francis Joseph... -Is still sleeping. You're wrong, at this time the Emperor is already working! Excuse me, I didn't know! Stop. You'll become lost in this palace. -Princess Auersperg! -Yes, Imperial Highness! -Why do you call the princess? -To bring her back to the alcove. -It's not necessary! -I decide. Coming to the alcove, be prepared for the confession. Not necessary to remember me, I'm already prepared! I'm speaking the languages that seem important: Hungarian, Croatian... -My teeth are white! -The way you speak with me... -continues the same! -What's the matter? Ready! Should you must appear to your fianc? in these clothes? -Good morning, Francis! -Good morning, Sissy. -Something happened? -No. -I only want to see the animals. -You can't see them from here! Later on I'll show you. Good morning, Mother! -There's no reason to become nervous! -Thank you for your instruction! I'm sorry that, on your wedding day, I've discussed with your fianc?, but... I asked to call the princess! Good morning, Princess. No, please. Now that. Thank you, you're dispensed. Why did you offend my maid of honor, withdrawing your hand? I'm not feeling good an older lady kissing my hand! -I'll explain you... -Pardon, mother. Can l? This kiss is in no relation with the age. Today, after the ceremony of our marriage... you'll be the first lady in my kingdom. In other words... you assume a position that until today my mother had occupied! From now on, you will be the first lady of the country... and kissing your hand... the ladies are demonstrating that, as Empress, you're above all them. Only one person can kiss your front instead of the hand. My mother. My mother? Wasn't it that you want to say? Yes, Francis! Come, my daughter. I'll accompany you to the alcove! Yes. Oh, Francis... everything could be so nice if you wouldn't be an Emperor! We salute our beloved fianc?, the Princess Elisabeth from Bavaria... once more on Austrian ground... and transmit our greetings for welcome to her new home! That Austria... will become her second home and a new fatherland... and that you, beloved Elisabeth... in your new fatherland shall have only happy hours. I'll will do all what will be within my reach. The exceeding, will be in the hands ofthe Almighty! God saves the engaged couple! Viva, viva! Viva! Viva, my Elisabeth, viva! TRANSLATlON: Ruth Graichen
