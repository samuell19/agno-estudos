This is Johannes Gutenberg who invented moveable type... 500 years ago and printed the first Bible. Recognised as the father of modern printing... Gutenberg stands on Park Row, the most famous newspaper street in the world... where giants of journalism mix blood and ink... to make history across the front page of America. Our story takes place in New York, in the lusty days of the Golden Eighties. When Park Row was the birthplace and graveyard of great headlines. The street of America's first world famous journalist, a printer's devil who helped... draft the Declaration of Independence and was one of its signers Benjamin Franklin. Patron saint of Park Row. And, it is the street of Phineas Mitchell. That will be alright officer, the new license will be here first thing in the morning. What do you got?

And now, if you want to make such progress in our profession... why don't you go work on The World? Pulitzer is introducing a lot of new things. It's a fine newspaper Mr Hudson, but I'm not a journalist, I'm a machinery. I'm interested in the problems of setting type by hand and how slow this is. Go away, Hackett is getting The Star out faster than any paper in the country. You gentlemen always manage to become involved in katzenjammer over journalism. I've learned there are 4 subjects one should never argue about... anthropology, bird calls, romance and of course, newspapers. You have become a wonderful legend Mr Davenport. It's tragic to remain a living legend Mr Mergenthaler, people only respect the dead. Often I feel guilty in taking such a long time to die. But I shall not die until I'm ready to forsake Park Row. - Which is already forsaken me. - Mitch, how about being your pleasure? Jenny, a keg-drainer, stick of straight, schooner chaser. Mitch, you got brains. Told me, how can a character like me get to be a character enough to... be written up in your paper? Probably, the prime minister stole a photograph idea from you. Look gentlemen I'm serious, I can sing and dance, I got a wonderful personality. In fact I got all the makings of a delightful character. Just because I'm not famous, people think I'm a bummer. Jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. You'll push Ireland's home rule out off the front page. - Or you'd be cock on the walk. - Be the talk of New York. You know, that's a wonderful idea, the splash would be heard around the world. And I'd be happy for the fellow who jumped off Brooklyn Bridge to marry my Jenny. Then I be a widow before I got married, don't listen to him Steve. You know, he's taking you serious. You know, it's only 120 little feet from the bridge to the water. Now, that isn't much of a leap but long enough to make you a celebrity. And when you open your own place you can advertise, the longest bar in the world. Steve Brody's 120-foot bar. - Ain't see it, Steve? - Yeah, I can see it. - Papa? Longest bar in the world. I'll have a couple of drinks and think it over. Certainly me boy, certainly. Jenny, a couple of Anniversaire for Mr Brody. - That story really bothers you, doesn't it? - Yeah. What you going to do about it? Buy a handkerchief? No. Who's crying in your beer about Charlie Mott? He's dead. Well, they hanged the wrong person, should've broken Hackett's neck on the gallows. - Where you going? - Potters Fields Oaks. - Going to claim a body? - No, going to lose my job. Grave people reported that a habitue of... this concert hall had the gall to sneak into Potters Field tonight and nail... a plaque to the cross of one Charles Mott, executed by the state, for murder. I had it removed. Would it be very simple to dispatched someone here but I personally would like... confront the man responsible for this accusation against me and my newspaper. - Every man is entitled to an epitaph. - I nailed it to his cross. - Ah? The ghoul himself. - I'm a newspaperman. - On what paper? - Your paper. He works for The Star Miss Hackett. What do you do? Shuffle refuse behind the circulation wrap? - Editorials department. - What's your name? Phineas Mitchell. Phineas Mitchell? There is no Phineas Mitchell on my paper. Firing me won't help the way you've prostituted journalism. I'm not running the gallows, I'm running a newspaper. - He was tried by your paper. - He was tried by a jury. - You sprung the trap. - I simply broke the story. The story broke his neck. - What was Charles Mott to you? - Nothing. I just don't like trial by a newspaper I call a contemptible publication. I call it peddling papers. You'd use corpses to peddle papers till the readers found out what a... frustrated journalistic fraud you are. Publishers like you that give anarchists the ammunition to try and stifle a free press. - Mr Spiro? - Yes Miss Hackett? - This defiler of graves, who employed him? - I did. - Why? - He's a newspaperman. And the best. Oh, I have seen this global monument somewhere. - He's Jeff Hudson, editorial. - There's no Jeff Hudson on my paper, this? - I don't know him. - That? Thomas Guest, cartoonist, unemployed. Mr Davenport, it displeases me to see you with this group. Charity my dear, you've made of yourself a newspaper... jackal feasting at the grave of a man you helped to execute. The Star reported facts, nothing else. The day The Star reports facts, Judas Iscariot will be sainted. Greeley turns over in his grave every time you go to press. Oh, another disciple of Horace Greeley. Mr. Spiro... escort this wench back to her slaughterhouse before I... throw her out of here right on her front page. Angel Dew, goes down like water and comes up like Nobel's dynamite. Jenny, I've done it, I've done it, I've done it Jenny, I've done the quest, I've done it. - Done what? - I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge. - Not a single bone broken, you're a liar. - I've done and I got witnesses. That's you over stuffed slime wrangler, I've done it and I lived. And that's what makes you hotter than a boiled sausage in a split bowl. Jenny honey, I'll be a celebrity tomorrow when people read about me. - And you'll be the proud girl on my arm. - Oh, you could've be... Let's put it in the newspaper, put it in the newspaper, Steve Brody, proud of The Bowery. Aristocrat of the Fourth Ward, jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge and lives to tell about it. You should've seen me, I was standing there looking down... looking down at the bottom, 120 feet to death. The longest jump ever made by man. It's a long jump for nothing Steve, I was fired from The Star. You was fired? I couldn't get anything in that paper unless I died. Alright Jeff, you put it. Look, I'm standing there see, I'm looking down... - I was fired too. - Oh, come on... Hold your horses, hold your horses. Ain't there a working newspaper man that stands to get... to cover the greatest feat in history? It's inside I need relief and nothing mix with water. - I don't keep your bathtub full of water. - Papa? - Not before he puts a chip on the bar. - He'll get sick and die. I'll stake him to a stone. Papa, you want me to tell them where you got that pretty figure tucked away off caucus? Would you inform on your own father? I tell them how I lace you up every morning. Alright, alright, give him a drink. I've been studying you Jenny. How you like me to draw your picture? Well, I was thinking of having her picture across the bar. - Are you going to draw it on the wall? - On a head of beer. Hey, I'll split your mainbrace if you give my girl here that sort of talk. No offense Steve, remember the face on the bar room floor? - I'm going to draw a face on a head of beer. - Four bits you can't. Put the chip on the bar. There's the groom, now let me see the bride. A large schooner Jenny, with a big head, that's fine. Nothing is to it when you know what you're doing. Perfectly easy Jenny, you're pretty as a picture. See? The trick is this indelible pencil, take it and draw yourself a picture. What's the good of writing anything if you haven't got a paper to put it in? You know what I'd do if I had a paper? Ah, here we go again day-dreaming at night and sober. No Mitch, what would you do? The first thing I'd do is christen it, I'd call it The Globe. I'd make it the best newspaper on Park Row, that's what I'd do. I'd give away free ice, coal, summer excursions. Christmas dinners for the poor that'd make them happy and make news. News makes readers, readers makes circulation and circulation makes advertising. And advertising means I'd print my paper without the support of any political machine. - That's what I'd do if I had a newspaper. - Would you give me a job? What Hackett pay you? - 18 a week. - I'd double it. - You'd pay me $36 a week? - Sure. If I had a newspaper. Why don't you dream up your own newspaper Jeff and give yourself $100 a week? - Mr. Mitchell? - Yeah? For 3 years every night, I've been listening to what you do if you had a newspaper. - Don't you like it Mr Leach? - I like it very much. You're the job printer got a shop in The Times, that right? - Tribune. - Oh, yeah. I don't make up my mind quickly Mr Mitchell but when I do, I act. Your dream kept me awake nights and I make my decision. You sure O'Rourke's whiskey hasn't gone to your ceiling? Like you, I never trust anything stronger than beer. If I were interviewing you, I'd have nothing so far, what you driving at? All my life I wanted to be what you are, a newspaperman. What you can do, I can't. What you need, I got. What I dream about, you are. I got a good steam press, I got a little credit for type foundry. I got a little newsprint, got a little cash. I want to go into partnership Mr Mitchell. You be editor and publisher of the newspaper. I'll be printer and handle the business end. You got the heart, I got the hands. You got the head, I got the press. What do you say? - A paper of my own. - Yeah. - And I'd be editor. - Yeah. And I do no man's bidding. If you run the paper the way you want to run it and answer to no one. - Can I name it? - Yes, you can name it Mr. Mitchell. Is it a deal? - Yeap. - You got yourself a newspaper. Don't worry Jeff, you're on the staff, I promised. - 36 a week. - 30 what? 15 a week. $15? Well, you promised me 36 if you had a paper. - Was a different paper. - It was a pro. - It was a different issue... - Oh, no, no... Alright, 18 a week... Ever draw for a paper Tom? - No. - You're on The Globe, 15 a week. - Spent all your money yet Mr Leach? - You getting close. You know what? What I need now is a good reporter like Mr Davenport. No Mitch, you need young blood to bring life to a newspaper just born. I could use some old blood too. - Like have them on The Globe. - Steve hear, the cops. Get out of the way, anybody in here have seen Steve Brody? - He ain't here, he's down at Lizzy the Duck. - What do you want of him officer? He's broken the law, he just jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge. - Any witnesses see him jump? - I saw him. Oh, we're wasting our time, let's go down to Lizzy the Duck. Wait a minute officer. Is this the man who jumped? Well, I don't know what his name is but he's the fellow which jumped. Take him away. Mitch, Mitch you're a quirk, you're a Judas. - It's me Brody, your bosom pal. - Lock him in The Tombs. Mitch you fake, you and your newspaper, you're a snake in the grass. - All you reporters are snakes in the grass. - Throw the keys away. Oh Mitch, how could you've done it Mitch? How could you've done it to my Steve, Mitch? This be Brody's story, on page one. On the bridge and safety, Steve Brody drops 120 feet to the water below. Arrested, locked in The Tombs. When I get the follow up? - The Globe frees Brody from The Tombs. - The officer won't like this. The readers will. - Make it 6 columns, 6 pages. - You're shaving close. 4 pages, alright Mr. Leach, let's get to the office. Look Mr Mitchell, I got printer's ink in me too, see. You got a chore-boy? No, just Mr Angelo and me, we take care of the shop. - I run the press and he sets type. - Who's Mr Angelo? This is Mr Angelo. Rusty, there's only one opening on The Globe. You know the difference between a guideline, a key line, a 40 to 4 stick stone? - Yes Sir. - No you don't, but you're going to learn. You're printer's devil. - From now on Rusty, you're a newspaperman. - Yes sir. You got a key Mr Leach? Fine, we're putting The Globe to bed tonight. Meet you all in your office in 5 minutes. 5 minutes, Mr Davenport. Beautiful Mr. Leach, great place to work. Plenty of room for our hard hitting competent staff. Rusty, get all the papers, don't only get The Star. And get rid of that shoe-shine box. Well, you heard it Mr Leach, where's all your type? Looks like we'll have to set up all our stories in a couple of inches. Oh, when that types is sorted up, we'll have enough to handle the paper. Most of our jobs is been handbills and cards. - How much paper we got? - Oh, couple of half bundles in the back. I didn't figure you'd want to go to press so soon. Paper plants are all closed now. Volume 1, Number 1, hit the street in the morning. Say, what's a job printer like you doing with such a big press? I once tried to run a weekly. I just didn't have what it takes to put out a paper. That press come between me and my wife many a time. She finally got to go fond of it too. - Jeff... - Yeah, what is it Mitch? Your brother is a butcher over on William St, isn't he? No, my brother in law, why? How much butcher paper can you get from him? Butcher paper? Yeah, we're short of newsprint and borrow his wagon. Oh, he's a mercenary. Tell him the Globe will take care of the bill. - You don't know my brother in law. - Oh, here's all the cash I've got on me. Alright, everybody chip in, come on. That's it. Drive the wagon up in the alley, that'll be our circulation department. - Give him a hand Tom. - Alright, here we go. Alright, let's all pile in and sort this type. Everybody grab a handful. - Here the papers Mr Mitchell. - Where's my change? - Can I help? - Yeap. You might as well start learning how to sort pied type now. - Pied? - It means when your type is a mix up mess. It'll be no time before you handle the hell box. What's that? This is the hell box, everything is thrown in it, it'll be your job clean it up. And that's why you're call a printer's devil. Because you'll be living out of the hell box. Were you ever a printer's devil Mr Davenport? Yes Rusty, I was apprentice. As a matter of fact I was 2 years younger than when Horace Greeley started. He walked 11 miles to get that job. I walked 18. I was with him when he built this building. Right where you're standing. Right where your shoes are. Used to be the home of another great editor Benjamin Franklin. That's why Ben is out there on Printing house Square. To see that nothing ever goes wrong on Park Row. - Say Tom... - Yes sir? - You know what that is? - A stove? It's no stove Tom, that's your office. Now give me a drawing of Steve Brody jumping off the bridge... being arrested and dragged off to The Tombs by the police. Take it over to Duffy's Engraving, get a woodcut, 4 columns. Wait for it, pay for it. - I'll take care of you later. - Right. Mr Davenport, write me the Brody story. No name ranks higher than that of Steve Brody. Make him a hero, bring tears because he was jailed. - You shall have molasses in every paragraph. - Mr Mergenthaler... Yeah? About that machine, we'll pick it up in the morning, have it ready, eh? Rusty, give Mr Leach a hand. - Jeff... - Here. - Steal everything you can but make it fresh. - Make it fresh. Rusty, hey Rusty, bring me that oilcan. They got a new zinc process to publish black and white drawings. - What about it? - Not for us. Let's have it. - Over like humor magazine. - Zinc, eh? So that's how they get such nice lines for Charles Dana Gibson illustrations. Gibson is getting as much as 4 or 5 dollars a drawing. You're getting a steady 15 a week Tom, you're better off than Gibson. Here the editorial Mr Angelo. - How's it sound? - I don't know, I don't read. - You what? - I can't read. Mr Leach. What do you want me to do? Say that I read when I don't read? Anybody can say that they read when they don't read... But I don't say that I read when I don't read. - Where did you find this Mr Angelo? - He comes with the press. Oh, I'll have to set up the paper myself, he can't read. How can you have a compositor that can't read English? Now don't get excited Mr Mitchell. - Mr Angelo... - Yes Mr Leach? - Will you please follow copy sir? - Yes Mr. Leach. It's perfect. Mr Angelo can't read or write but he's the fastest typesetter on Park Row. Mr Angelo, don't ever change, the day you learn how to read, you're fired. I've seen a bunch of volumes 1, numbers 1, this is beautiful make-up Mitch. Greeley started with 40 dollars credit Bennett started in a cellar. - But you're in good company Mitch. - How come you never got to be an editor? Edmund Bourke, about 20 years before I was born, stood up in parliament and said... There were 3 estates of the realm, the peers, the bishops, the commoners... Then he looked in the reporters' gallery and said, yonder there sits the 4th Estate. More important, far, than they are. Somebody is got to go out and get the news Mitch. People like me get it, people like you see that it gets to the readers. Some men are born editors, some are born reporters. But a fighting editor is a voice this world needs. A man with ideals. And the joy of working for an ideal, is the joy of living. I know. Price, one penny. 4 pages, not bad, not bad. Oh Mr Bennett, Mr Greeley... Mr Raymond, Dana, Pulitzer... What are Mr Dana and Mr Pulitzer doing on your walls? They're living. They're your rivals, your contemporaries. Dead or alive, they're still the best publishers on Park Row. - One penny. - Oh? I'm so sorry. Now tell me, what do you really think of The Globe? Volume 1 Number 1, this is a stallion busting out of its stall, bristling with news. - This is a newspaperman's newspaper. - It'll die like all the rest of them. The others weren't printed on butcher paper. Yes? I apologise for disturbing you Miss Hackett. Now, I'm not a journalist but this is definitely an outrage to all newspapers. I can't understand why Mr Spiro dislikes me. Oh, the entire editorial department dislikes you Mr Wiley... because in you they see the business executioner. - My first loyalty is to you. - That's why they have contempt for you. Your first loyalty should be to The Star. - Is this a new kind of a printing press? - No, I'm trying to compose type. - Type? Type like this? - Yes. You mean, you talk to this machine and you make this? Mr Angelo, today it is possible for a man to tap keys. Write what he thinks Nd it comes out on paper. You've heard of this machine, the typewriter... - I don't know. - I have watched you work. You are fine, the fastest compositor that I have seen. But it takes such long time for the printer to put his text into type. I think to help progress of printing, it is better... if there is a machine that can do what you do, faster, very much faster. Begging your pardon. If you can make this do what you say, you smart like Mr Gutenberg, go with this? You got 400 years on him Mr Mergenthaler, that's quite an advantage. No man bettered Gutenberg. Many people have tried. You think he can make with that machine what he wants to make? Sure, he's a watchmaker... He has the golden touch for delicate machinery. Sometimes I don't know what he's saying, the way he speaks. - What you mean? - He's not clear, he speaks with big accent. You know what I think? If he can make that machine work the way he says... - You don't need me to set type. - Oh, you'll learn how to operate it. - You got to know how to read to operate it? - You know as much about it as I do. Don't worry about it, you're not getting fired. How can I be fired? I no got pay yet. You give me a job and I do it, I pay you money. I don't know if I like this work on a newspaper. The newsboys want to know when we're coming out again. What you tell them? I told them we're putting The Globe to bed tonight. And coming off the same time tomorrow morning. Fine, how's the bank account Mr Leach or do we come out with another porterhouse edition? We'll be lucky to get enough paper together to get out a rump roast edition. - Better start breaking up the pages. - - Come on Mr Angelo. Yes Mr Leach. - How's Brody? - He's alright now. Jeff, get the Bowery Boys and get them over to The Tombs... - Get my hands on him. - Yeap. - Rusty, get the plug-uglies over there. - Yes sir. I think I have a story, made a few notes, I'll give it to you right off the cuff. - Torts, arms, what is this? - Part of that statue, the gift from France. - What about it? - It's on display now in Madison Square. Yeah, we'll go over it later, right now I got to write the Brody follow up. You better stir up the members of the Dead Rabbits too, get them over there. Now you'll have 3 rival gangs congregated in The Tombs. Yeah, Brody belongs to all of them. What's the matter? - Must we have a riot just to get a story? - I didn't say I wanted a riot. Man jumps off a bridge and dies, there's nothing they can do about it. If he lives, they throw him in the clink. In this case, Brody is a hero, you can't deny that. There won't be any riot. Is all you have? The Republican anti saloon movement in New Jersey is spreading. Democratic majority in the House to reduce the number of employees. This just a little party capital, during fall elections, I want something controversial. There's a rumor that The Globe is getting Brody out of The Tombs tonight. So? Well, we're back to Mr Mitchell again. - You like him, don't you? - I respect him. Brody broke the law, take my word for it, The Globe isn't strong enough to free him. Tell me something about this stallion bristling news. Where did he come from? Who are his parents? Is he married? Engaged? Divorced? How he get a start? What is he want? All that I can tell you about him is every year produces one great newspaperman. The stock isn't as good as your first issue. Wrapping paper, I made the rounds of the shoe shops. You know what's very exciting Mr Mitchell, you came out with Brody's jump this morning. Tonight you have another edition with his release, two issues in the same day. Remarkable, only page 1 is been changed though. Once I get my hands on enough type, paper and ink... I'll come out with 2, 3 maybe even 4 editions a day. Just change the front page. You know Mr Mitchell, I've been giving you a great deal of thought... Me too, a lot of thought. Don't you like what you've been thinking about? Is that the only dress you got? Oh it's good makeup Miss Hackett, nice form, nice balance, pretty as a perfect front page. - Thank you. - But you remind me of the obituary column. You're always in black. - The copy is in, how come you're not in bed? - I couldn't sleep. I've been going over these notes you scrawled. - How come you left your cuff here? - Oh, I have an extra cuff. Eiffel? Is that the same Eiffel that's building that tower in Paris? Yes. - What did he have to do with the statue? - He built the iron frame. De Lesseps... You've been eating at Dinny's Beef & Bean again. The same De Lesseps that built the Suez Canal? Yes, he had something to do with the Suez. What's this about a subscription? The Franco-American Union raised 1 million francs for Bartholdi to build the monument. - How much is that? - 350,000 dollars. Why they build it? To cement the friendship of two great republics, France and the United States. A gift from a people to a people, not from a government to a government. So the people of France actually donated their own money to build the statue? That's right. What's this about a torch in Madison Square? Congress passed a resolution accepting the statue. But declined to grant a subsidy for the necessary base. The head is at The Battery, the body is on South Street. - Doesn't got a leg to stand on, has she? - No Mitch, she needs a pedestal. - How much would that cost? - 100,000 dollars. I am annoyed because you gentlemen seem to lack imagination and circulation ideas. This Mitchell has run the first front page editorial cartoon to appear in newspapers. Would you have run a cartoon on the front page Miss Hackett? Plaster The Star with penny valentines? No, thank you. I'd rather see my paper in Hades than commit a frowsy woodcut to the pages. But at least the idea would've been born here, that's what I'm driving at. He came out with 2 editions yesterday, on butcher paper, wrapping paper used for shoes. Heaven knows what kind of paper he'll use tomorrow. Now he's offering to publish the name of every subscriber. No matter how small or large the amount... pennies or dollars, rich people or poor people. Oh Mr Wiley, there's a German in this country experimenting... with a machine to compose foundry type. - Find him and get him. - You mean Mergenthaler? Yes, that's his name. You know where he is? Yes, he's working on his machine at The Globe. - Ottmar Mergenthaler? He's at The Globe? - Yes. - G?ten Morgen, wie geht es Ihnen? - Wie geht es Ihnen? Herr Mergenthaler? Mein name ist fr?ulein Hackett, Von The Star. If you don't mind I prefer to speak English. Of course. Mergenthaler, you know, I knew a Herr Mergenthaler in W?rttemberg. Oh, you have been to W?rttemberg? That is where I am from. In Germany it's Merkantaler, in America Mergenthaler, it's easier to say. Oh, I like the people there but I don't like Stuttgart. Who likes Stuttgart? You know there's some talk on the street about the... greatest invention in the history of printing since Gutenberg, if it works. Yeah, if it works. The whole idea is to enter the dream of all printers. A machine that will end the hard and slow work of setting type by hand. This is now my dream too. Well I suppose you know that Mark Twain is also working on a typesetting machine. - The Paige Patent. - Yeah, I know. I've heard that Mark said it'll be able to do everything but drink, smoke and go on strike. Can yours? Oh, it's so complicated, perhaps it will even talk. I shall try to follow the conversation. Why not? Perhaps you will have the answer I am looking for. I call this a blower machine. I call it that because the matrices up here are moved down to here. They are blown down by an air-blast, when I touch one of these keys. You mean you cast your own type when you touch those keys? Then a bar of lead is melted so that the... justifier forces hot lead against the metal... and it forms the type. See, the face of the type is in perspective. How long would it take you to set up a column of type? Oh, as long as takes 12, 15, maybe even 20 of your printers by hand. Then it would be no trouble at all to get out more than one issue a day? Nothing. With 10, 20 maybe 40 of these machines... I could have a circulation of a million daily, maybe 2 million. Yeah, the big problem now is to separate the paper from the metal... - Sticks together and the type is not clear. - Oh, we must solve that problem. I'm going to help you all I can Mr Mergenthaler, I've a great newspaper. And once we baptize this new machine, we'll make newspaper history. Have a lot of room for you in Composing. My men could move this machine over without turning a wheel. I'll give you all the support you need, money, parts, assistance. What's the matter? Miss Hackett, I'm only interested in the progress of journalism. Of course. I would give you this machine for nothing if The Star were a great newspaper. It's not great, it's not a newspaper. It's a cheap collection of words and garbage you call journalism... - that will die. - What are you? A parrot or an inventor? If you have mechanical genius, use it. You're too brilliant a man to ape Mr Mitchell and repeat his little paragraphs of envy. I like you Mr Mergenthaler, I respect you. And I want you. But understand, that unless The Star gets this machine... all your hard work will be buried on Park Row. Without a trial or a tombstone. Miss Hackett... if I need a tombstone friend Mitch will buy it for me... like he bought one for you. That's much better, makes you look much younger, don't you think so Mr Vandenberg? Yes. - Did he turn you down Charity? - Did who turn her down? Obviously she didn't come over here to visit our steam press. She could've come over to visit me. No Mitch, she's not that interested in morals of an editor. I have a sneaking suspicion she just... failed in attempt to shanghai Mr Mergenthaler away from the Globe. - Is the editor here? - I'm the editor. I want to give a penny for the Statue of Liberty. - Oh, thank you very much, what's your name? - Martha Downs. Poppa said I was a good girl for giving my penny to the Globe. - Rusty... - Yes sir? You give Miss Downs a Globe receipt for one penny For the Statue of Liberty fund. Miss Hackett, would you care to donate a substantial sum? Not that I elect The Star but at least there was some privacy for a man to think. You know, the separate little cells you've been working in, are all wrong. We going to have a real editorial department, with everybody in one office. And I can see what's going on, sit down Jeff. - Got plenty of room? - Yeah, plenty. That's your copy desk, from now on you're in the slock. When you going to get a telegraph Mitch? It's a lot more important than taking down these walls, we need a wire service. I was over at Associated Press, you know what they want for their service, for a week? - 300 dollars. - Well, the AP is worth it. Sure, sure, I was just thinking if I had 300 dollars what would I do? I'd get myself a lot of good newsprint, the finest paper money could buy. And I'd come out with a real headline, big, bold, 120 point. - Where would you get such big type Mitch? - I'd make it, cut it out of wood myself. - Yeah, it will have to be a big story. - Mr. Davenport... when you ran a story, why do you always put 30 at the bottom? 30 is a symbol to all printers... and it means it's the end of the story, there isn't any more. Is it hard to tell with the story? Well, if you see a dog running down the street... with a can tied to its tail, that's nothing. But if it stops, turns around, unties the can and throws it away... - that's a story. - Yeah, I'd like to have a dog like that. You want to bet? You got a lot of them right here, type lice. That lice? Yeah, they are little teeny weeny insects and they live right inside here. And they get fed by the ink that sticks to the type. You never see them Rusty? Ah, they have a lot of fun and play games. Can I look at them? I don't know, if Mr Mitchell think you got ink in your blood, you can look. - Can I look at them Mr Mitchell? - What do you think Mr Davenport? Rusty, why do we put 30 at the end of copy? Because it's the end of the story, there ain't no more. - Alright Mr Angelo, let him look. - Look down Rusty, way down. Now you're a real printer's devil. Type lice? There always will be type lice, even if my machine will work. There'll always be type lice. He got to do something about increasing circulation. Yeah, a lot of people tried to figure out new methods of selling papers. - You know, I've been thinking about fish. - Fish? Yeah, they got fish carts out there and they sell fish right on the street. What's fish got to do with newspapers? Oh, why not sell papers from a pushcart? Have a stand. Newsstand, a Globe newsstand. I do not write words be peddled from the street from a pushcart like fish. What do you think Mr Davenport? Well I think there's sufficient wood in here for at least 3 newsstands. - You mind Mr Leach? - No, might be able to squeeze 4 out of it. We'd use the room anyway. Hey Mr. Mitchell, there is the Frenchman, he's going into The Star. Yeah, yeah, that's the Frenchman who's connected with the statue alright. Maybe Hackett is going to give him a big check for the pedestal. Yeah, if she'd just pull the curtains, we could see what was going on. C'est Les bonne mani?res n'?xistent pas. Vous, vous Les auriez en fran?ais. Mademoiselle, vraimont, je Na sais Que dire. Mais, il est tr?s difficile Du croire, qu'on vrai gentil homme... pourrait aussi ?tre un hypocrite. - Mais pardon, je Ne comprends pas de tout. - Tout Ceci, c'est Du camouflage. - Du, Du camouflage? - Camouflage. Oh, pardon monsieur, she's going to tell the whole world... that my country gave America the statue just to camouflage a loan. Just a minute Mr Dessard, did she say when she was going to tell the world? - O?? - No, no, when. When is she going to tell the world? Now you got to be exact Mr Dessard, a newspaper has to be factual. Now, this is a very important story but is no good unless we get the facts. - Demain, tomorrow. - You're sure? - Oui, oui, tomorrow. - Tom... - Yes sir? - Get pen and paper. You're going to draw a picture of a beautiful woman. I want an extra 10,000 copies on the street this morning. They're loading the wagons right now. You'll be the first paper out today. Oh, you look pleased with the editorial Mr Spiro, changed your mind about being factual? I'm looking at The Globe. He's not only beat you with your own story... but he's been out on the street for 15 minutes. And there's something else new, Newsstands. And every one of them is marked The Globe. - How was the banquet? - Fat with news. I wrote down a few highlights. The choice is yours. - AF what? - AFL. American Federation of Labor, it was organized tonight. The Printer's Union is joined it. The other side of the cuff Mitch, that's an interesting item too. - ANPA. - American Newspaper Publishers Association. It'll officially be an organization at the end of this year or the beginning next. - Got a list of the publishers? - You should've been there. I likes to met men like Pulitzer, Dana Bennett... Reid, Jones of The Times. Was she alone? I didn't think that was important enough to notice. Just a question, I thought maybe she was with some out of town publisher. No, she was alone as usual. Does that type of woman appeal to you? Look Mr Davenport, you're an old man but you're not senile. That's why I hired you, you're very virile mentally. And a question like that isn't exactly proof of mental virility. - What do you think of her? - I don't, as long as you're on the subject. - Is very little I can add. - Right back on the first paragraph again. All I can tell you is her name is Charity of which she has none. If you had to write her obituary, what would you write? Yeah, yeah, I could tell you. If I had to write her obit. Charity Hackett, publisher of The Star is dead. She was ruthless and ambitious. Her beauty was like an almanac, that lasted unto her death. Her face was better than all the letters of recommendation in the world. Poise, a privilege of nature... Her voice, short lived sonata. You're in love with a corpse my boy. - Banquet over? - No. Glad you dropped in, I was just going over the list of publishers. My story would be incomplete without a quote from you. Sometimes it takes more than a quote to complete a story Mr Mitchell. - That's why I dropped in. - Alright, complete the story. Well, I was in the midst of champagne... and I came to the decision that it would be a very good idea if we got married. Or a merger, your masthead and mine... We could elope with tomorrow's first issue. It'd be a wonderful honeymoon, not on a biological basis, but... A mass circulation of The Star-Globe. You know, I was just thinking... I could buy a ton and a half of newsprint with that coat. Oh, you could have a lot of things I have. A large staff, a circulation wagon, wide distribution. Money, contact. You could be the most famous editor in New York. And by the way, this coat is worth 5 tons of newsprint. Alright, it's a merger. There'll be only one baby in the family... and we'll christen it The Globe. I'll complete the story for you Mr Mitchell. Yes Miss Hackett? Mr Mitchell's sensational treatment of the news, coupled with a crusading spirit... - can easily develop into grave competition. - Oh, I agree Miss Hackett. Then why haven't you done something about it? I have no jurisdiction over the editorial policy of this newspaper. Oh, there is no editorial policy that can beat him. - Mr Wiley... - Yes? I want you to stop his source of supply. Paper, type, ink. The Globe will be dead next week. Mich, they're breaking up our newsstands, come on. Where's Hackett? Mitch, what's the matter? Busting up my newsstands isn't going to stop me from selling papers. - Busting up your what? - I thought you were a newspaperman. - Where's Leach? - How you like it Mitch? You wanted an different editorial department so I turned his desk around... and now you can see everything that's going on. - Alright, where's Leach? - He got a Buttercake Dick's brewery wagon. Went to South Street at the fish market to try and get some paper. Oh, he better come back loaded with paper. I'll give you some copy in a minute Mr Angelo. Jeff, we're going to tell this town all about Hackett's circulation tactics. Wait now, I want you to get this in the lead... We're going to fight with news, not knuckles. We use words, not fists. - What happened to you? - They killed the horses, burned the wagon... - dumped our paper. - Where's Rusty? - They ran over him, both legs. - Will he live? - I don't know. - Will he walk? They don't know, he's at the hospital. - Who ran over him? - Monk Rodgers. - I know him. - Get him. Hackett, you ran over a Globe man. Killing horses, burning borrowed wagons and dumping newsprint... isn't going to stop me from coming out every day. You started a war Hackett, a circulation war and I'll finish it. Mr Spiro go back to your desk please. Mr Wiley, I don't want an explanation, I just want to tell you one thing... I do not have to resort to physical violence... to compete with The Globe or any other newspaper. You have done is an affront to me and an insult to The Star. What do you want? Look, you're certain that I was responsible for... this circulation war, that's not important. What important is that you and I have a truce. A little late for waving a white flag, we've already suffered a casualty. There'll be more casualties if we don't stop the violence. Heard you went to the hospital to find out about Rusty. Just running down a kid, kind of got your attention, eh? Look, I fired Mr Wiley. Someone had to give the order to kill The Globe. Did they tell you Rusty might lose both his legs? Thick iron wheels ran over them, that wide. The Star is got the only wagons in town with wheels that wide. Why don't you run over old Mr Davenport? He's a nice old man about ready to die. Make a great story if he died for a paper, wouldn't it? Or maybe little Mr Angelo, you only need a little wagon to crush his little body. - I want to see the editor. - You're talking to him. I thought you'd print the name of every contributor to that Liberty Fund. We do. I gave $5 last week and I've never seen my name in the paper yet. - What's your name? - Taylor, George Taylor. Taylor, eh? - No George Taylor in here. - Oh, here is my receipt. - Where you get this? - What you mean, where did I get it? - Who gave you this receipt? - I don't know his name. Look mister, I run a little smoke shop down in The Bowery. I've been there for 20 years and I got a good name. I don't like your tone. I gave 5 dollars in good faith. Now, you put my name in the paper or give me my $5 back. I can't put your name in the paper Mr Taylor and I... can't give you your 5 dollars back because we never received it. This is a forged receipt, it's not ours, I'm sorry. - Where is this Mr Mitchell? - I'm Mr Mitchell. I gave 25 dollars for the pedestal and not a single mention of my name in The Globe. And my husband gave 50 Mr Mitchell, 50 dollars. - Do you get your money back George? - No, I didn't. Mitchell, I've been around this street a long time. And I hate seeing a paper using its pages to cheat the public. I gave 7 dollars to the Liberty Fund and I haven't seen my name in The Globe. And a lot of my friends are holding receipts. We're beginning to think that you're using this patriotic gesture to pocket the money. Now if we don't get our money back, I'm going to see that Washington hears about it. It's only to prevent a tragedy that I've come here to see you. Someone is passing forged receipts for the pedestal fund. The Attorney General of the United States... ordered Mitch to return all money to subscribers. - Why don't you like me? - I don't dislike you Charity... I'm simply not fond of you. If you were fighting The Tribune, World, Herald, The Sun, that would be a real fight. But you're fighting The Globe because Mitch excites you, antagonizes you. And outwits you, you're jealous of him. And you've made it a personal newspaper war. I could understand, if you love him, you and I both know, you'll never get him. You come from a great line of newspaper people, but you... you're not of our profession, only on the surface. I'm glad you're a woman, for when you die, the name of Hackett shall die with you. Hey barmaid, cute, eh? You patriotic? Want to give some boodle for the Liberty statue? Just give me what you can, and I'll call you patriotic. Sure, I'm patriotic, and here's a dollar mister. Here's your receipt. Watch The Globe paper for your name. - Come on Red. - Wait a minute. Don't you want to see the first barmaid in America make a you special drink? No, no, we got to go. Oh, I'll make you a Blue Blazer, on the house. You can make a blue blazer? Can I make a Blue Blazar? I can make the best Blue Blazer you ever had. Anybody that's giving money for that pedestal... then they deserve more than a Blue Blazer. Well, you know what? I got lots of patriotic customers here. I bet you I can get you 20 dollars for that pedestal. - 20? - Got any more of them receipts? Oh, we have. My father gave 10 dollars for the statue. I heard today that Ed Shaunessy, the music impresario... from Delmonico's gave 100 dollars for the Statue Of Liberty. And my father's brother gave 20 dollars for the statue. And his brothers all gave 30 dollars for the statue. If you give more of them receipts I'll get some for you, I'll make you Jenny's Special. Brandy mashes with a shot of Alabazam. Gentlemen, wasn't that worth waiting for? That's what I call a Blue Blazer. With a shot of Alabazam and a shot of Sangaree. As a matter of fact I even put in a little printer's ink and sheep dip... because you're so patriotic. Now, that's what you call a Blue Blazer. - Was that worth waiting for? - Yeah. That's a Blue Blazer mixed with a shot of Alabazam and a shot of Sangaree. You sure they're on the house? Sure they're on the house for anybody that's patriotic. Steve, here's the guy that's been passing them forged receipts. You know what I did to the man who ran over the kid's legs... I'll crush your head in with this unless you tell me who's... paying you to pass those Liberty receipts. You can't scare me, Wiley of The Star is behind me. I ain't afraid of you or your paper. That's the story I want. Turn him over to the federal authorities and we'll pick up the newsprint. Mr Davenport, I want you to write the story exposing Hackett. You tell the readers that there'll be a... Statue of Liberty on Bedloes Island on less than 60 days. I guess that's the big story for your 120 point headline. Don't tell me about it Mr Davenport, write it. Are you hurt? Are you alright? Hey Jack, give me that pail of beer. - Mr. Merganthler, you alright? - Yeah. - What about Mr Davenport? - He was gone before it happened. Gone where? He wrote the story, he said goodnight and then went home. Alright, give me a hand, let's get him in the other room. - Easy now, easy. - Careful. - Are you alright Mr Mergenthaler? - Yeah, yeah. - You get a good look at any of them? - No, they were to fast. They had it all figured out like clockwork. Each man knew where to hurt it most. Well, it just mean we come out a little later, that's all. Jeff, find that story Mr Davenport wrote. Mr Angelo, let's sort out this pied type. It'll take us a month to separate this type. Look, they threw mailing glue all over it, may take more than a month. We got a lot of paper out there, we can't let it go to waste. - We can't afford to miss a single edition. - Mr Davenport's story isn't here. What you mean isn't there? It's got to be there, someplace. Look around over there, I'll look on his desk. - What is it Mr Mitchell? - Mr Davenport's obituary. - Who wrote it Mr. Mitchell? - Mr Davenport. Read it Mr Mitchell. Josiah Davenport 75, Journalist... died today, at peace with Park Row. The search for a man to carry on the fire for Horace Greeley... was successful. His last words were written to this man, quote. Phineas Mitchell, The Globe. In most countries there is no freedom of the press, in the United States, there is. It's freedom was born in 1734, in the libel trial of John Peter Zenger... printer and publisher of the New York Weekly Journal. He was acquitted by a jury. When anyone threatens your freedom to print the truth... think of Zenger, Franklin Bennett and Greeley. Think of them, fight for what they fought for and died for. Don't let anyone ever tell you what to print. Don't take advantage of your free press. Use it judiciously, for your profession and your country. The press is good or evil according to the character of those who direct it. And The Globe is a good newspaper. I've put off dying waiting for a new voice that would be heard. You are that new voice Mr Mitchell. And now that I've found a man worthy enough to die for, I'm ready to die. The old press is silent. If there's a place where newspapermen go and a last edition is put to bed... I want to be there to hear the roar of The Globe, the thunder of the type. I want to be there, still covering the story on the cuff of the last of the survivors... who saw American journalism born on Park Row. 30. - It's hot. - It's type. - Can you make a sentence? - Yeah. Go ahead. - What you call this Mr Mergenthaler? - Line of type. Mr Leach, get that press beating. Mr Angelo, railroad those forms. Steve, get that butcher paper in there. Jeff, get started on the copy. We'll put Mr Davenport's obituary right on page 1 and we'll box it. I'll write the Hackett expose. Mr Mergenthaler, if I give you my story right here... can you get the words out of your line o'type as I talk? Yeah. Line o'type, that's a good name for my machine. Here's your lead. The press... is good or evil... according to the character... of those who direct it. And now that the story is revealed... The Globe will continue it's subscription drive for the Lady in New York Bay. - Hey Jeff. - Yeah. Look at that, special Sunday Extra. Fourth of July, look at that headline, 120 point. - Look at that paper. - In Linotype. This is history Jeff, this is history. - How's the press, will she live? - She's in bad shape. There'll be no Globe out tomorrow Mr Mitchell. Well... you can all start looking for new jobs. Sure is a wake for the dead. What plans I had for you? This was just the beginning, so many things I wanted to... to print, fight... expose. Make history together. We started something new, newspaper business. Had it all figured out. All figured out, repletes... newsstands, railroad stations.. By lines, for good writers. Columns... The Globe, is dead. Long live The Globe. Extra, extra, read all about it, read all about it. Extra, read all about it, extra. I'm surprised at you Mr Mitchell, you had a paper to put out. And what you do? You go to a saloon. - How did you do it? - My machine, we had the copy. While you were filling your belly with schnapps I was on the Linotype. The explosion burnt it a little but I fixed it quickly.. - Where you get the press? - Right across the street. I came in here after the explosion, I read your page one story. I didn't order the violence, Mr Wiley did. He blew up your press-room. I am responsible because I gave him the order to kill The Globe. In doing that I violated the Publishers' Code. That's why I borrowed your staff for the paper make up and I printed The Globe. - Good ink. - The best. 8 pages. - Real newsprint. - Your headline deserved it. - How many on the street? - 12,000. We're doing what you always wanted to do. By noon there'll be 4 different editions of The Globe on the street. And to complete the story Mr Mitchell... I didn't commit newspaper suicide because is love you... Oh no, I killed my newspaper so yours could be born. Because I read Mr Davenport's obituary. For the first time I really see what you're fighting for. That's why I'm giving you the Park Row. And when you see this monument on Bedloes Island... this memorable day of October 28, 1886... I want the whole world to know that we have a Statue of Liberty... because of a newspaper.
