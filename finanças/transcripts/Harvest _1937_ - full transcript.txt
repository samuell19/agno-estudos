HARVEST Based on the novel by Jean Giono STATION MASTER Can I come in? - Well? - It's me. What about? I'd like to take tomorrow morning off. Naturally! No, I have to go get my father. Free body transport! No, my father's coming here, alive. Where is he? Aubignane, a mountain village. Only 3 are left. 3 what? 3 people. My pa, the Aubignane blacksmith... the village blacksmith, he's 80. And Mamèche, the well guy's wife... buried by the well he dug 'cause the water had sand in it. Her husband, he thought he'd dig a well... and he dug his own grave. And there's Panturle, the youngest. He's maybe 40, a real woodsman. All 3 want to stay 'cause they're the last. But Pa is old and... I'm afraid it'll all hit him one day. So I want him at home with my wife and kids. So I'd like permission to get him tomorrow. So you're leaving, Gaubert. It has to be done. I'm not going willingly. Leaving all this... it hurts. How many plows ya made? Try and guess! Maybe 300... Maybe more! I knew how to make 'em! I still do but I can't do it. And what good would they be? Is that your stuff? That's it! No sense trying to take the big one. There's 3 spots too narrow to get through. Really want it? No, it's my wife's things. And that? I want that! Goddam! Taking that? Yes, it's not really very, very heavy. I mean, not for an anvil. When I was 60, I could still carry it. I don't want to leave it like this... next to a cold forge. Understand? I understand. I bought it at the Manosque Fair on my last day in the army. It's silly, right? But ya know, when you're old... We'll try. Well, old fella... Wait... When's Jasmin due? He said he'd leave home at dawn. - Are ya ready? - I'm ready. I don't want to say goodbye to Mamèche. It'll hurt too much. I'll do it for ya. Give me a hand, Gaubert. Let's go! So your boy wants you? Yeah. 'Cause ya been complaining? I'm not the kind that complains. You'll be near the kitchen? What about your daughter-in-law? I don't know. You'll like living away from Aubignane? Maybe he needs ya down there. Maybe. No need for 3 bowls now. Why? He's dead? He's gone. Say that again! He just left. To go where? To his son's. His son's? All of them? Ya know, he was pretty old. And I'm not old? Do I leave? Do I have a child? Madonna, you do as you please! You've flogged me... dried me up and eaten me like wheat! Let her be! You let my prayers rot! Look at me with your chalk eyes! What'll you do to me now? You've already bled me! Calm down, Mamèche! What good'll it do? You know what she did to me. My man's there... in the bowels of the earth... down there sucking up water with his mouth... right at the heart of the spring... so goats can drink, so there's water for the soup. What good did my man do... dyin' in this pig dirt... just to find water for you? Now that he's dead, they're leaving... one after another, like pigs huntin' for acorns! And to hold 'em back, what's she doin'... laughin' there? Holy Virgin! If you're after me... like a big flea suckin' my blood... you've no need for my prayers! Take it easy, Mamèche! Take it easy. Come over here by me. Your soup's good, Belline. I haven't had any like it in years. You could've had it ages ago! What did you eat up in your ruins? Goat's milk, rabbits, almonds. I missed good soup. I couldn't come down here for fear of being in the way. But you see? You're not! Why say that? Of course he is! But it's OK 'cause he's Papa! Old folks are always in the way but we can't kill 'em! And one day we'll be old too. She says that but deep down... It's what she thinks. Belline, I'll take my anvil and move on. Belline are ya crazy? I said the truth, so he won't give orders. Who gives the orders around here? Me! I'll hit ya if ya want! And respect my pa! I'll send ya back to your farm, with manure in the well! That's enough! You've finished eating! Get up and serve him! Stand next to him! Pa, I didn't mean to hurt you. I know, child. I know. Boy... Let me see you in the firelight. What for? I said to let me see you in the firelight! What is this? Lean down into the firelight. So? You saw me? Yes. So? I'm thinking about that coal-man who had so many children. You could have children too. Where's the girl who'd live here? Anywhere, if you make her do it! If I find you one, you'll take her? Where'll you go? Never mind! If I find a girl, you'll take her? Yes, I will. Gedemus! You monster! You've found the right spot! Why a monster? Seeing me work makes you tired? Work? You don't get many blisters! No, not on my hands. But I got a big one on my shoulder! You sharpen knives with your shoulder? My dog is dead. So your sorrow gave you a blister? No, it's the strap. That strap's a knife-grinder's sorrow! My dog used to help but now I'm all alone. Going uphill is awful. I have to buy a new dog for my rounds in the spring. But being a constable won't give you meningitis! Last night... you'd have seen a constable make people respect the law. What did you do? At the Oriental Café, there was a big theatrical show. I was there to maintain order. The poster on the café window said... "The Great Tony and his repertory... "with Miss Irene of the Parisian theater!" They'd set up a stage with 5 or 6 tables. It was packed. Miss Irene got up on the stage. She had hands like a potato peeler's! Before she could speak, they all began to laugh. So she didn't know what to say. Then the Great Tony leaped up and smacked her 4 times. Really! Yes, he really smacked her! So the boys jumped on Tony and... beat him up! Without me, they might've killed him! Good, I like that. So you arrested him? Nobody filed a complaint! Anyway, it was all like a family affair. Constable, come to the inn quick! - Why? - It's disgusting! What is? A bunch of coal-men came. At least 15 from Gadarin. God forbid! - Forbid what? - Wait! They ate at Martin Pinchon's inn. The girl who couldn't sing last night was there. Still there? The man had left her. She'd slept in a doorway. In this cold weather! The coal-men asked her to eat with them. Nice boys! When they finished, they made her go to the stables. One even locked himself in with her. When he came out, another one went in. Then another and another! There were 15 of them. And then? She screamed like she was dyin'! - So? - They mustn't kill 'er! Are they armed? They're not killers but she's in trouble. That sort of trouble is well-known. It doesn't hurt everybody. You'll let them ravish the poor girl? Ravish? It takes more than that to kill a woman. I'm only a constable. I can't. It's not stable enough? - Right. - Well, I'll go. Something could go wrong. Something should be done! Not coming? Watch my things! Come on, Martine! He might do something illegal! - There? - There! Aren't you coal-men ashamed? You have to be pretty low to jump on a poor little girl! Who's talking? Me! Understand? I'm talking to you! And I can answer ya without talkin'! She's yelling for help! Come out and I'll stick ya like the pig you are! What? Come out right away! Son of a bitch coalman! Phony nigger! Here's my first warning! Who is it? Come out of there, pig... or I'll cut your head off! What's going on? Some coal-men pigs are hurting a little girl, see? Come out, my dear! A real man is here to protect you! Miss, I'm proud to say the beasts who were so disrespectful are not local boys. Neither am I ! Here's the constable! Tell him everything! Constable! I can't say anything to them! I can't arrest them! The one who started it is the guilty one! True! Where is he? - Out back! - In back! - Chopping wood! - Chopping! I can't do anything to him! I'll show ya what I'll do to him! Come with me, you poor victim! If the law can't help, I will! Come on, victim! There! That big lout! - You're sure? - Yes, it's him! No mistake? It's him personally? - It's him! - OK. But right now the lady needs a drink. What she needs is a brandy! So... 2 brandies! Stop crying and let me tell you something. I'm Gedemus, the knife-grinder. Yes. OK. I'm a knife-grinder and all alone in the world. Like you, I suppose. Yes. OK. It's sad to be alone. Yes. Do you want to come with me and earn your living? Yes. Will I have to sleep with you? That's not the important thing... but we'll have to think about it. Yes. OK. Now that we agree, listen to me. Cheers! Got some clothes? Just this one. He took the rest. That's mean but not stupid. So now what? We'll buy me a dress. Women! Such spendthrifts! As if buying a dress won't cost money! Don't you have any? I have a little but not for dresses! It's not that I don't work hard! I grind all day long! And for years! The day I began, if I'd put my grindstone to the train rail... that runs from Paris to Marseilles... by now it would only be only a toothpick. But I wouldn't be rich. It simply proves... work doesn't make anybody rich. But my work keeps me alive and I like it. How can I help you? We'll see. Your dress needs thinking about. You can't wear that. It's not very... "knife-grinder". No, it's not "knife-grinder". Can you walk in those shoes? They're cardboard! Cardboard! They're good for nothing! I want to sleep. It's the wrong way. No, keep going. - Now what? - What's that? Nothing! A dead tree. You're sure? Yes, what else could it be? Keep walking! I'm scared! Of what? If you get me scared, I'll run! So stop it and get going, ya lazy thing! - What? - There! There what? It hopped! It stood up, hopped and then laid down! - What hopped? - The tree! A tree hopped? What do you mean? Ever see a tree hop? You're sick! That black thing! Ever since this morning! With a branch on one side, then on the other! You said it's a tree! It's still there and it hops! It's your eyes, dummy! A hopping tree? I'll take it to a fair! Maybe not a tree. What else can it be? I saw it hop and it's not my eyes! Don't start that again, idiot! Now what? There! It hopped again! Wait... I'll go see. You're dreaming! It's nothing. If you don't like it here... we'll finish eating on the road. Let's go! There's a barn! Another tin of sardines? If you like. But we only have two, and it's the first day. You're right. Hey, Arsule. - Know what I'm thinking? - No. It's not important but I'll tell you anyway. I think we're always silly in life. When we have nice things we keep them for tomorrow. Pointless. I don't mean the sardines because we'll eat them tomorrow. And tomorrow isn't far off. Although tomorrow it's likely that... What? Nothing. I mean, there's something new every day. And then, well, you're done for. If we knew everything... but we don't. Talk, talk, talk... It's because you're afraid. Me? No. No, I'm not. I need to have a sound head or I would be. I'm not afraid. Hey, we've got other candles and that one's still long. We can leave it to burn tonight. Arsule! What? Hear that? - What? - Listen! Hear it? Yes! Don't move! Gedemus! Go see who it is! No. You're scared. You'd worry about me. Besides, it's not anything human. It's a ghost! How can I fight a ghost with a knife? If I cut it in two, it'll laugh at me. Don't talk! Don't move! Don't breathe! If I don't go, it's not 'cause I'm scared. But I know what's ridiculous. I don't hear a thing! That's even worse! What? It hopped again! There! Far away? Right in front of us! Ghosts come at night, not in the morning! "A morning ghost, we mourn the most!" Let's change direction and go to the right. I know where we are. Near Aubignane! Not bad, Arsule! Vachères is down there. Not bad! - What's Aubignane? - That! Those houses with holes, gone to ruin. That's Aubignane. I'll pull the cart if you're tired. Any inhabitants? You never know! Push! Nobody! But what a wind! Well, Caroline? No more milk? Now what? Where'll I find you a billy-goat? It'd do us good to see some people. I'd like a fountain so I can wash up. As I recall, there's a small one... not very big... down behind the last house in the village. Let's go. I'll take the cart and you pull back on the way down. Come on! There's your spring! We'll rest here. It's not as deserted as the others. They must not have left long ago. Hey! Any knives to grind? Nobody's here? Nobody! Hear that? What can that be? I'm scared! If you're scared, let's go! Give me the soap! Now that I've had 4 glasses of wine... I can explain the noise we heard this morning. It was a rat. The rat made a stone fall off an old wall. The stone hit some old metal or maybe an old tool. It made it go "ding". It scared you. It intrigued me. That's all! - If you say so. - I do! And now, good night! Good night! Hear that? Gedemus! Hear that? It hopped again? Arsule, you must be hysterical! It's your head that hops! You need to see a healer! You women! There! I saw a man in that tree! He fell in the water! Quick! Quick? What for? I said come on! What's a man doing in a tree? There! I've got him! If he's drowned, he's drowned! So? - He's heavy! - I'll help you. He's so heavy! He's a peasant. At night in a tree? Maybe he's crazy! He's breathing! That's good... For him! Hey, you! The drowned man! You're saved! He doesn't answer. Maybe he'll die! Him? God forbid! Look how he's built! Cut off his head and he'll die. Otherwise, no danger! Come on. He'll wake up by himself. You'd just leave him? And why not? Do you know him? Me neither! He's breathing. Let's go and don't make any noise! Because a man, a peasant... who lives in trees, especially at night... I don't trust him! Bye, drowned man! Come on! Otherwise, things'll really hop! Go to sleep and be quiet! If you hear him come this way... pull my ear with all your might! Put out the fire so he can't see us. We've had lots of hops. To hell with the hops! It's not possible! "It hopped!" Get to bed! Hurry up! It's a cold night. Don't take it all! Better? Are you better? Yes. What happened? You fell in the stream. I couldn't sleep. I was afraid. So I came up gently to see what you were doing You were just turning over, so I thought, "He's better." Took a weight off my chest. That's kind. Who pulled me onto the grass? That was me, too. With Gedemus, the knife-grinder. We were in the field, about to turn in, when I heard a branch snap. We ran along. Thank you. You're very kind. Why were you in that tree? I wanted to see you, to know who you were. Are you from here? Or far away? Or elsewhere like us? I'm from here. Here where we are? - Up there. - Aubignane? On the hill. There's no one there. I am. You were outside my house today. - The one with the source? - Yes, that one. We knocked! Where were you? Inside. And you didn't answer? Why not? That's not very kind! Dunno. So that's what you're like! What if we were in need? You're right. If you were... It's not my fault, you know. I live all alone like a recluse. I wasn't like that before, but now I'm all alone. I'm... as helpful as the next man, only... well... I'm alone. Are you cold? But this cloth absorbs all my warmth. I'll take it off. It'll be better. You've no shirt. You got no wife, you got no shirt! Better to do without, than to have dirty laundry, right? You live alone in that big dead village? No. There's Caroline. Your wife? No, she's a goat. She's intelligent and understands me. I talk to her. And the sparrows don't fly away when I walk down the street. This morning, two landed on my back! They don't know what they're doing. It's the mating season. So it is. The mating season. Why do you stay up there all alone? I'm the last one. With me there, it's still a village. I make noise in the streets. I even sing. If I leave, it won't be a village anymore. It'll just be dead stones. You can't keep it from dying. I know. I can't do anything all alone. The last old lady left last week. She said, "Ya need a wife." She's right. If I had a wife with kids up there... weeds wouldn't grow in the street. There are lots already! If there were children, I reckon they'd stop growing. I talk nonsense. No, it's not nonsense. What about you? - Are you from here? - No. - From town? - Yes. Oh well, then, you don't know what loneliness is. Oh yes I do. Better than you. That's silly. No, it's the truth! Come on, you're from town, there were people around you? But often you can be with lots of folk and you're even lonelier. That's true. You've been taught. No, not a lot. I know how to read and write but I left at 15. And then? What did you do? Then my parents died. So I went to work. I was a seamstress. And then... I earned my living. I worked hard. And now I'm with Gedemus. He's a good man. Are you married? Almost. Do you love him? He's a good friend. He loves me as a master does his donkey. I'm at the helm. Yes, I know. I saw. I love him as a donkey loves its master. Not a lot, then. Some donkeys are affectionate. Which? She-donkeys. So you wouldn't leave him? Where to go? Up there. What a laugh! Yes, it's a laugh, because you wouldn't go to cry. If you wanted to... If I wanted to what? Come up there. It wouldn't rain in my house anymore. You think I fix roofs? No. But I do. So why don't you? You're not up there. I'm alone. So if the rain falls on my head, it keeps me company. Quiet! You'll wake him. He sleeps like a pig. But there's no need to talk so loud. What's your name? He calls me Arsule. Arsule. That's nice. They call me Panturle. Panturle? What does it mean? It means me. - Arsule. - Yes? - We're here! - Where? Home... Open your eyes. Blood! Yes, I skinned a fox this morning. Good! But it needs to be cleaned up. Good. And the key? It's in the door. You mustn't leave it in the door! Do as you wish. It's your key now. Arsule, after you've peed, we can go. The drowned guy! Of all things! He's gone? Arsule! The drowned guy's gone! He wasn't that drowned after all! Well! That would be too much! Blood! She was right to say it hopped! Did she hop with that big drowned guy... or did he hop on her by force? She'd have yelled. Besides, what can I do? All alone against... nobody! I must tell the police! I'll go to the police! The police, they're the ones. The police. I'll go to the police. Officer, it's me! - What is it? - It's me! It's a crime! A murder! Close the door! He's crazy! Not crazy. He was drowned. No, not drowned! I saved his life! - Have him sit down. - Yes, sit down! A chair! Thank you! I'd begun my spring rounds and reached the plateau... You mentioned a crime. Yes. It's a story and... A story or a crime? The crime is part of the story. For your information, my name is Gedemus. Urbain Gedemus. Your name is Gedemus? We've no proof! And why shouldn't I be called... Gedemus? Yes, why do they call you Gedemus? Why don't they call you Spartacus... or Rasibus or Glorius? I think you see my point. I don't see a thing but I have my identity papers. You can't trust people without papers, nor with too many papers! Let's see... I'm a knife-grinder. Scissors, razors, etc... Urbain Gedemus, knife-grinder, if you say so. The rest of the story, please. I left Manosque 4 days ago on foot with my cart. We crossed the plateau in 2 days Such an empty place! Deserted. I mean, there was no one there. I found the trail of Arsule and him. It led me to Aubignane. In front of the house where I'd heard a noise... there was a big puddle... of blood! - Blood? - Blood! He had hopped on her! There! That's it? And why did he do that? What do you think? What do I think? You'll soon know. And my opinion will interest you! I'm sure. But I've nothing more to say. - Handcuff him! - What? Me? It's a joke? I did it? I'm sure of it. A killer? You look like a killer! I can't accept words like that! There's the spot! He said a big puddle! So the big puddle left a little spot. The spot could mean a fatal wound! But where's the body? Who hid it? We'll act like we suspect no one. Police! Open up! What's wrong? Our uniforms tell you who we are. Can we come in? Who are you? Where you from? Done anything? Your papers? My name is Irene Charles. Here are my papers. I'm sure. "Irene Charles. Single." "Occupation: Singer." You sing? Doesn't look like one! Why is a singer holding a trowel? I was cleaning. I live here now. Since when? Since yesterday. Who brought you? Gedemus the knife-grinder. So who's Arsule? Me. And what's that blood spot? Yesterday a hunter skinned a fox by the door. A hunter or poacher? I don't know. A passer-by. Live here alone? I live with the man who owns this house. Gedemus killed you? That's too bad! We locked him up. You'll let him go! We'll have to. Please do me a favor. Don't tell him I'm here. Tell him I left... that I'm happy. Almost... And he'll never see me again. Here! Horsy! I was wrong. I should've said nothing. But if they found her butchered... then who'd have been in trouble? Gedemus! And that officer who calls me Rasibus! And Horsy! Horsy! My god! Now what'll happen? If I just had something to hone! Good morning, sir. Sir? You're very polite today. I've no right to be impolite with anyone. Will you please follow me? Something new? Yes, there's something new. Maybe you found her decapitated... see me as a true criminal and you respect me now? No, not decapitated. A slit throat? No. All in one piece... and in good health. Perfectly healthy! I'm a simple judicial error. So small! But a good one. An excellent one! Naturally, you're free now. Naturally! The sergeant has nothing to say to me? I have something to say to him. I don't advise it. An officer who makes a judicial error... does not give advice. Show me the way, officer! Yes? Ah, good morning, Mr Rasibus! No what? Not Rasibus. Gedemus! He's changed his name? Show me your papers. No, not twice. His papers say Gedemus, that's true. Don't go too far. Arsule is alive and... I spent the night in jail. What do you think of that? I think it's the truth. That's all? I can't be more grandiose. If you like the facts... let me tell you 4 that concern you. Meaning? 4 facts about you. Only 4? I could tell you a lot more. Rasibus, Arsule is alive. She's magnificent, cute and splendid. But she doesn't want to see you again. What about me? You're free to leave. That sounds like a gift. Isn't freedom a gift? Not for an honest man. An honest man is free so far as the authorities allow. You're the "authorities"? Yes, I am. And what is "intelligence"? It's not you. No, it's not. I am innocent. Unfortunately! But let me thank you for "horsy"... "the cuckold knife-grinder"... for the handcuffs... and all your kindness... etc... Listen! I suddenly remember a thought... spoken quite rightly by a thinker. It's very deep and threatening and it says... "Innocence is fine, but don't go too far!" Meaning? Misusing your innocence could cost you! If we dug up your past... You can dig yourself! I am a hardened innocent man. So why are you here? That's what I'd like to know! I'll tell you. You want to be booked for... illegal use of arms, unauthorized camping... and lighting a fire near a forest. I'm arresting you for vagrancy... and contempt of a magistrate. I did all that? You did! I get it! No need to go on! So... Attention! Left face! Go to your grindstone! Leave town as soon as possible! Forward! March! 1... 2... How far did you go? To Reine-Porque! Were you cold? Don't bring the wood in here! I cleaned the cellar. Put it there. It'll dirty the kitchen. - The wood? - Yes. It's not dirty but it's messy. OK. Hurry up! Where'd you find that? Up in the house near the church. At least 20! But half were moldy. Put your napkin on! You and your ideas! We have them. Why not use them? I feel like I'm at the barbershop! You don't go often! I did in the army. We had a company barber. That smells good! Saturdays he'd shave me. And you'd go see girls! Where else could I go? The colonel wouldn't invite me to visit him. Or we'd have brawls with the alpine infantry. What were you? I was the dumbest of the mountain artillery men. - Not true! - You know better? I won't have it! You were maybe awkward, but not the dumbest! If you say so. But each time I said something, everyone laughed. Even the non-coms! Idiots! Don't start to talk like that. Why are you opposite me? I don't like it. It's like in a restaurant. Like buying a horse or playing cards. It's no good. Where'll I sit? Next to you, I can't see you. I don't mind not seeing you. But I need to touch you. Here... A thigh? A nice piece of the back? I'm not very hungry. You don't eat very much. You don't like a nice hare? I don't feel like it. I prefer potatoes and carrots. I used to think game was food for rich people. How wonderful to eat hare every day! But it's not real food. You prefer partridge? Maybe. But even so, they're dead animals. Wait! Liver is really very good! It'll do you good. Eat! Now I see what needs to be done. I'll have to plant some wheat. Who's this coming? Of all people! Panturle! I thought you were dead! I don't feel like it! Of all things! Yes, it's me! I'm really not kidding! Alphonsine! Come look! Alphonsine! Come here! Look! Panturle! It's good to see you! You're too kind. He's not dead! We mentioned it the other day! Come have a drink! Gladly! I don't drink wine very often. Come sit down! Come on, Caroline! Where were you going? Here! Good! If you need anything, it's yours! Thank you. I need something for her. A billy-goat. Got one or do ya know one? She can't stay like this. She noses around. She gets so excited, it's incredible. She'll soon be talkin' dirty! Heaven forbid! I don't have one but Turcan does. Etiennette can take her over. I also want to ask you for some seed grain. I want to plant some wheat. Sensible at last! A little bit. I can't pay for the seed. I'll settle with ya after the harvest. And I need your horse for a few days. I'll pay you cash or in wheat. That'll do. How much wheat do you want? Can you give me 300 kilos? OK. Deliver it to Reine-Porque tomorrow morning. A cart can go that far. I'll do the rest. OK. And the horse? Whenever he's free. I'll send him over... in 4 days. You're a big help. It's easy, Panturle. No problem! Had a good wheat crop this year? Yes, a good one. Look at this! Marvelous! Is that what I get? Yes, that's it. Can I take a small bag with me today? Yes, you can have it. - Thanks. - A drink? Seen the kids? They were here... Clodomir! Seen the kids? They're down behind the barn. Nano! Lison! Here they are! You forgot your snack? We didn't know it was time. You're not hungry? Always! But that doesn't tell me the time! Here! Here! Go on! I'll cut your bread. Go play now! That's beautiful bread. Like the good old days! It's the same! We re-lit the oven. I knead it. She bakes it. And the flour? I make it with my wheat... in the old mortar from the attic. Flour doesn't sell like it used to. "Bleached" flour, as they call it, is disgusting. Plus the taxes and the mechanical kneader... The baker heats his oven with gas! So I eat my wheat! It saves money... and it's better! - Alphonsine. - What? I'd like to ask you for something. A slice of your bread. I'll get... No, l'Amoureux, I'm not hungry. I have to tell you... You'll find out soon enough. It's nothing bad! I have a woman up there with me. The bread will please her. Take it all! I can't pay but I'll make it up to you. Whoever paid for bread at my father's farm? Panturle, what's come over you? Living up there makes ya talk nonsense? Wanting to pay for my bread! Listen... That's a good one! So piss in the soup! Listen, l'Amoureux... you don't understand. To me, this is so wonderful... so extraordinary. Since the army, I don't get much bread. Sundays when I'd go down to Banon... But now I have a woman... it means even more to me. When some go to town for their wives... they buy them a little bracelet... or a scarf or some lace. But I'll take her this bread. I can't tell you how I wish it was tonight. She'll set the table and put out the napkins... 'cause we have napkins now! I'll come in and not say a word... and I'll put the bread on the table. She'll start to cry. It's silly to say such things! L'Amoureux, if I've upset you... You have! I didn't mean to. Please forget all that. What do I have to do? Take two! Right! I'll get another one! - Thanks, l'Amoureux. - Big ox! - Thanks! - As thick as a log! Dumb as a donkey! All he does is say thank you! Where'd you meet your woman? - Up there. - Found her in a trap? Almost. I took her from another man who left. Is she young? Yes, like you. Pretty? To me, she's the prettiest! She's beautiful. She'll stay up there with you? Yes. Ya tied her to a tree! No, she has the key. She can leave if she wants to. Ya kiss her with that beard? She kissed me without my askin'! Shave! You're like a thistle! And get a haircut in town. Or you'll end up caught on a branch... like the man in the Bible! Women like you the way you are but... if you make an effort to please them... that can really please them! She says that 'cause I haven't shaved in 3 days. I was cutting the fields! If you can cut a field... you ought to be able to cut a beard! Belline! Panturle! Recognize me? Sure! You're the only woodsman left in the country! And all dressed up! You came to see Father? He's by the stove. Go see him. After I do the animals, I'll give you a drink. He's not very well. I'm afraid he's getting senile. Good lord! He'll be glad to see you. Gaubert! It's been quite a while! It feels good by the stove, eh? You've found yourself a good spot. Take my hand. Pick it up. I'd like that. I can't move it anymore. Well, Gaubert? Well? What is it? You can see how it is. They're dead. When did it happen? One morning something let go in my kidneys. The children thought I was acting up. They said... "Try! Be brave!" Brave! But there was nothing to be done. What's Jasmin say? What do you want him to say? He had a doctor come and he said... "He's paralyzed." That cost us 10 francs. So now I sit here on my chair like a scarecrow. I can't move a finger to chase a fly away. When I'm in the way... and they want to clean or cook... Jasmin grabs one side of my chair... and Belline grabs the other... and they move me like a piece of furniture. When I first got here... I had a shady spot in the orchard... and in the house with my boy and the kid. I taught the magpies to talk... by holding them under a flower pot. I did tricks. I made folks laugh. Now I'm being punished. I shouldn't have left the village. And Mamèche? She left. I haven't seen her since. I don't know where she is. You're moving down too? No. I just came to see you. I thought you might like to do some work again. I didn't know... I came to ask you to make me a plow. But now... Of course. It's not like you to want a plow. You're a hunter. You should have a sword. One day the hunting's good, next day it's bad. It's really just fooling around. Ya get tired of meat after a while. But I found some land... on the other side of the plateau. It's deep and rich. I want to grow some wheat. It's odd that ya feel that way. I'm no longer alone. I have a woman. You do? Where's she from? She's an orphan. She had some trouble. Now she's with me. She's my wife. But we can't live off my hunting. With her there, I want bread. So does she. So... That's natural. It's a good sign. What's wrong, Gaubert? Did somebody hurt you? Your daughter-in-law? Shall I talk to Jasmin? What's wrong? It's silly but I can't help it. It's 'cause Aubignane's going to live again. Wanting bread... A wife... That's a sign. I know. There's no mistake. It'll get off to a good start. Men will have the land again. But... Who'll run my forge up there? Old folks shouldn't think like that. If that's why you cry... Ya knew you'd have to let someone else take over one day. That's life! The only thing ya need to regret is... that the next one won't make plows like you did. Ya really had a way with plows. Go on... Ya earned your laurels. Ya pounded enough iron. You talk to me like before. Yes. Why? I don't know. Maybe, but it shows you understand. Panturle, I'll get you that plow. Or something like it. I want one of mine to start ya off. Listen, you'll see. Is Belline still in the orchard? Yes. Why? She's a woman. She's a miser. If she knew I gave ya something... it'd make her sick. Why do ya want to give me something? Because I want to be up there too. Since my carcass is dead and I can't go... I want to send something in my stead. Something I made. Take my cane. - What for? - Take my cane! Run it under the bed. You feel something hard? Yes. Pull it out! It's a good one. The last one. I made it at Aubignane. Take it. What I want is some wheat. To cover Chénevières hill with wheat. To grow wheat all around Aubignane... right up to the doorways! To fill it all with as much wheat as the land can bear. It can bear a lot. A big thick layer! In my day, it was famous for that. The day a good man goes to work on it... that day... it'll be a blessing for the wheat. BARBER I thought I'd never see you! You saw me? No, but I could feel you. Come on! Lift your head. I like that! Why? Because it's softer and nicer! Kiss me! Wait till you see... Look! Our Father who art in heaven... Give us this day our daily bread! What? I'm saying thank you. And that's not all. Look! Wheat! Wheat! I'll plant it after I've plowed. - Wait till you see this! - More? More! There! The best of all! It looks like the prow of a boat! You brought everything? The mule's not doing anything these days... so I thought he could help you... take the bags up the mountain. I brought pack-saddles too. See what a friend he is? He'll tote 3, you 2. In 2 trips it's done. And 2 bottles of wine. From my wife. Thank her for me! And here's Caroline! She had 3 days with a billy-goat. The shepherd said it worked. It's completely changed her character! No! Go the other way! What is it? Nothing. Go that way! What was it? Nothing. A fox trap. There's one from here who'd be glad to see us together. Who? An old lady. They called her Mamèche. The well man's wife? Yes. She always said to me... "Get a wife! Get one!" "If ya want, I'll go find her for ya!" And so she went. And? She left and she died. - Who told you? - I just now saw her. What was left of her and bits of her dress. That's why you made me run? Yes. She looked for her on the plateau? I don't know. I don't understand. I do. Listen... Was she not very tall... all in black, always waving her long arms? That's right. Well... if I came here this spring... it's 'cause something brought us here... off our normal path. And that something... was fear! She's the one who made noises in the ruins... and the one who stood up in the weeds. Listen... She came to look for me! It's a good thing. Listen... If she came to find me... I must go for her. I must bring her back here. I wanted to but I was afraid of your reaction. The poor thing! Let's go! What a year! The same thing for you too? The wheat is pathetic! Miserable! We usually get 50 loads. This year, maybe 5! And bad quality! With 10 times more work and harder than usual! For you maybe. But elsewhere? Poor Mr Astruc! He won't earn much off the farmers! Why say that, Balthazar? If I didn't buy wheat, you couldn't sell it! You'd never get what I pay you for it! Yes, you wheat brokers always lose! True, I often lose. You can be happy, Mr Astruc. This year you won't lose much. There's no wheat! It's the same everywhere? You can say that again! In Reillanne, Forcalquier, Manosque... They all tried Canadian wheat. And you see? If you listen to the men with the books! "Plant this! Use that! Don't do that!" And look what happens! You're an enemy of progress. What's progress? Getting 5 loads of American wheat... and not 50 loads of French? Progress means going forward and trying something else. I'm in mechanics and industry. But science means progress. The Banon school teacher told me... progress is like an insatiable god... who devours his children before serving them something. Where are you going, Mr Industry? Like you, to the Manosque fair... to sharpen knives, razors, axes, sickles, etc., etc... and anything that cuts. Will there be many people? Unfortunately, there'll be... more people than bags of wheat! Mr Astruc, you want some wheat? Wheat? Where'd you see any wheat? I saw 20 bags of fine wheat. - Got a cigarette? - Here. Where is it? I'll take 2. OK. What'll you have? Nothing. But if you make a deal, I'll get something? I could tell Mr Claude but I thought of you. Got a light? Where is it, if no one's seen it? Behind the merry-go-round, where they hitch the mules. A man's there. He doesn't talk. He just waits. I said, "What's that?" He said, "Wheat." And it's true! You know me, Mr Astruc. This isn't the first time. You've never seen wheat like this. Come on! Agathange, I'll be back! Serve the beers! Of all things! Wheat like the good old days! As heavy as lead! You don't see this kind every day! Hands off! Hands off! If you're buying, OK. Otherwise, use your eyes. I'm here to buy. Then you can touch. Where's it from? Aubignane. Reaped by machine? Reaped with these. Your hands're bleeding! You produced 20 bags all alone? More than that. 30! He's no lazybones! Especially this year! Or any year! This is prize-winning wheat! I've never seen any like it! I'll take your 30 bags. No, I'm keeping 10. What for? My wife likes bread. You'll eat 10 bags! Just 5. We owe the other 5. For borrowed seed? 3 bags of seed grain. And 2 I owe him... because when I was in need... he gave me 2 loaves from his land. So I'll give 2 back. You really give back plenty! You can never give back enough for borrowed bread. How much for my 20 bags? - 130 francs. - That's all? That's all? 130 francs is a good price. Ordinary wheat gets 110 this year! This is good, yes, I agree. Very good. I was the first to say so! But it's not gold! If I listened to you... ! So, 130, alright? 150. 150? It's not gold but I want 150. Alright. But 30 bags! No, I said I was keeping the others. OK? OK! - Happy? - Who wouldn't be? What's the receipt? 3,000 francs! 3,000! I never saw so much! It's not big and it's just paper. Takes less sweat to make money than bread! But money can buy anything! We'll go to the store we saw earlier. I'll buy you some corduroy pants and a jacket... with hunting buttons, you know? - And you? - Me? Come on... I won't buy unless you do. I'll see... You first or I won't buy a thing. Me neither. Who gives the orders in our house? The man does. Except in this case. Even in this case! Being rich gives you a bad temper. I'm rich 'cause your money is in my pocket? My money? Did I make the wheat? Naturally! I plowed? You didn't plow nor flail it. But the first grain of wheat was you! Come on! KNITTED WEAR Arsule! What do you want? You've made a mistake. Of all things! Pardon me, but even so! The more I look at you, the more I wonder if it's you or not! Maybe your sister? I don't have one. Don't you recognize me? I may have seen you before. Gedemus! The knife-grinder! I have nothing to be sharpened. Look at me! "It hopped!" "It just hopped!" Nothing? Afraid I'll hurt you? I'm not afraid. My man will protect me! Excuse me but taking me for a fool... And saying that you're not you! You want to say what? Talk about old times, our long walks... with the cart following us. All by itself? No. Pulling, pushing, pushing, pulling... Pulling, pulling... Who pulled it? We took turns. Then, the camping at night... the soup... Then the drowned man... and the police. Good old days! And even so, she left you? I miss those days. Even the soup I gave her! Even so, she made the soup! - Badly. - What? See? It was you! No, it was someone else. The one who left you... if you'd loved her, she might've loved you. She would've come back. If she didn't, she doesn't want to? I'd think that way. I was almost guillotined for her! That counts in a love story! A guillotined knife-grinder! If she knew I was arrested by the police... locked up in a jail on wet straw! Accused of killing her! - It wasn't true? - That I killed her? Not quite. But you started to. I only hurt her by harnessing her... A fine beginning! Goodbye, Mr Gedemus. My man is waiting. It's her but she's changed. Or changed so much, it's not her! Or someone else who hasn't changed a bit! That's it! Yes, that's it! Knives to grind! Find it? Yes. Here! Open it! You and your ideas! You're so sweet that... I know you wanted one! It's beautiful! And this! Plus this! Aren't you ashamed? In the street! It doesn't hurt a soul! You devil! You look like a mayor! We don't have many voters in Aubignane! You got a good price? 3,000 francs! - Really? - Really! I got the money. That makes me happy! Bravo! Luck like that calls for a glass! What kind of glass? Don't you want a drink? No! Not and have to sit in the middle of all those people! All that noise and music! My ears would go boom! I'd go crazy. Thanks, L'Amoureux, but no drinks for me! He's not buying! You in your fine suit, it's up to you! That's how it's done. Then go have a drink, both of you. I have an important errand to take care of. Buying me a gift? See how thick I am? I didn't even think of that! You have the money! Buy whatever you want! You'll be in what café? At the corner of the square. OK, I'll give you all this. See you later! Where are you going? To make someone happy. Gaubert! Do you hear me? It's your friend! Panturle! He recognizes you. I came to show you something important. Something serious! Something to make you happy. The wheat I told you about up there... I did it! Here it is! Let me touch it. Say thank you for me. Kiss it for me. What? It. The wheat. Hey, there! What do you want? Panturle's house? Yes, I'm him. Hi! I came to see you to... Can I come in? It's pretty cold outside. Come in and close the door. It's warm here. Yes, not bad. Are you alone? Yes. You don't need that. I'm not what you think. I'm not a bandit. A nice knife! I know. I'm a knife-grinder. So that's it! Yes. That's it. Sit down. From time to time, I sharpen it. If everyone was like you, I'd be out of work! If I'd waited for you to do my knives... I'd have really waited! But I came by here once. I came to this house but nobody was home. Then, I had problems all the time. That time, I'd saved a man... from drowning at the Chaussières pool. I know. You know? It was me. It was you? Then, you can tell me and explain something and... I didn't come to Aubignane for nothing. Here's the story. I was with a woman. I'll tell it so you can understand. One I'd picked up. We got on... well enough. And that night she disappeared like mist. Vanished into thin air. I understand, you got over it, fresh as a daisy, and there you were. All alone, 'cause you couldn't see. We were on the ground so you couldn't see us. Then you left, that's natural. But what about her? I still don't get it. So I wanted to ask you, like I asked the folks in the farms over there, you wouldn't happen, when you're out hunting, to have come across her? Dead or alive. In any case, whatever, anyway, just so as I know... do you get me? Why do you want to know? I'll tell you why. I had found her one day in Sault. She wasn't the cream of the crop... but I wasn't too choosy. In my work, I don't earn much. The poor take the women they can get... and they're not always the prettiest. But for housework, she wasn't worth a fart. For example I, me, I like dried bean soup. I'm allowed. With potatoes, tomatoes, a sprig of basil and a splash of oil. Not difficult. She never made it well. And as for feelings... It's nice, isn't it? Hearty thanks come cheap. Shows you're well brought-up and it's just right. For those kind of feeling things it was like dead wood or stone. You give her everything... with her fancy ways and give her this and that... and make her life easy. She was like wood. I had a dog... he gave me more satisfaction! If I lie, may bread choke me and wine poison me... and let me die without confessing! So, friend, I've told you everything. For your own good. I think I saw you at the fair. They say you know where the woman is. Yes, I do. She's here with me. So? Nothing. After all I've said? Yes. Because all that doesn't count. You must be glad to be rid of her. Yes, in a way, I'm glad. But I'd saved her from some brutal men. I saved her! - And you saved me. - True! I've saved a lot! You don't look like a saviour. But I am. And then she disappeared. I went to the police. They kept me for two days! You don't ever forget that. She was mine, after all. I fed her for months and months. Fed her? Probably. And you, friend, Did you think she'd given you months of her life and for all that time did you think that she reckoned her life was over? That all her days would be like the ones with you? Listen... Don't be cross, we're here to talk, to say everything we have to say. You say she's not pretty. You're not either. She must not have laughed very often with you. - Understand? - She said that? No, she never mentioned it. It proves her memories aren't good. So if she ate your bread, I think you're even. Yes, maybe. Maybe even. But now I'm alone! When I pull the cart for hours, my arm trembles. I can't hone! She used to help me pull the cart. So you want me to do it? Of course not. But if you keep the woman... in her place... give me a donkey. OK. I don't take what belongs to another... and I like to talk face to face. Actually, I expected to see you one day. You're here. We'll settle this and that will end it. You'll see. Here. I'll buy you a donkey. Understand? I'll replace the woman with a donkey. Understand? I'll give you enough to buy a donkey. - 100 francs. - And it's over. That's it and it's done. But Arsule didn't need a harness, whereas a donkey doesn't have hands to pull with. So... The harness? OK. How much is a donkey harness? Not for a mule! A donkey! Secondhand... 50 francs. OK. Agreed. There! But sign me a paper. A paper? What for? This doesn't need that! Ya always need a paper about money. Write this down. "Received 150 francs." And sign it. Nothing more. That'll do. You and I'll know what it means. - With a "d"? - Received! Underline the 150... so it's clear. What's this? Gedemus. My name. OK. Now... I'll leave. Want me to say goodbye to her? What for? To please me. Understand? No? What good'll it do? Like I said. Just to please me. No. Goodbye. Goodbye. I could finish sharpening your knife. You don't do it quite the right way. Understand? Yes. Thank you. But even so, the way I do it... may not be good but it's enough. Goodbye, Panturle. Goodbye. What I said about her... it wasn't true. I know. It's just the opposite. I know. If you tell her about this... say I asked for 1,000 francs. That's better. She'll be proud! Goodbye, Panturle! Jasmin! How's it going? It's not easy... but not so bad. Breaking the ground was hard. The second run will be easier. What brings you this way? While cleaning the cupboard yesterday... Belline found a big envelope wrapped in newspaper. It had my dad's will and 15,000 francs. And some plans and notarized papers... things from the surveyor. According to them... Pa left me some land from his father. Over by Reillanne! Southern exposure. As rich as this land. This is good earth. - Beautiful! - Look at it! It's deep and fallow. It can feed a lot of mouths! - Ya got what for your wheat? - 3,000! I kept 500 kilos for me. I didn't grow much. It was a test. This year I'll need twice that plus a horse. He's not yours? L'Amoureux loaned him to me. What're you thinking? I think I may quit the company. They treat you nice? Yes, but I don't have much education. I can't advance much further. And cities have become impossible! It's all politics. Royalists, unions, communists... radicals. They all want ya to join! Always obeying somebody or something! The tax man, police, the law... morals, the station master! Obeying all the time... annoys me. If the land could feed me and my kids... You poor guy! It's fed millions! Why not you? My wife would like it. Come have lunch at home. We'll talk to Arsule. She's smart and educated. She'll know what to do. How many goats, chickens and tomatoes... and all the rest. With Pa's 15,000, I can have the house fixed. I'll finish my row and we'll go up. Let me do this one! Jasmin, if you go off the line... ! I did this before I was drafted! Not much, but some! I'll lead the horse! I'll take my jacket off! Suits are made for those who obey, not those who work! What's wrong? Nothing. Don't be scared. You almost fell. You're so pale! How do you feel? I'm not ill. On the contrary! Contrary? Let me see you. It's like... You weren't so fat before... Yes... Now you know! For sure? Yes. He's already alive. He just kicked me right here. You and your ideas! You and your ideas! I'll finish this later. I can help you! I was just surprised and happy... No, you have your work now. The wheat is my grain to raise. You tend to yours! Come on, let's go home. Subtitles: Jaib Warner Subtitling: HIVENTY
