You're going to die. [Woman] No. The results are conclusive. There is simply no cure. You need to accept this. I can't. Angelica. There is only one God. And it's not you. Hello, Angelica. Hi, Lance. Missed you at the funeral. I hope it's cold in there. He was your father, too. Don't patronize me. You didn't ask me to meet you here just to chat. What do you want? I'm dying. I'll be right beside Dad. Right in there. Unless I can do something about it first. There's a loophole in Father's will. States that if I die before the age of 40, then you become the sole heir to his entire fortune. I'm 39. I have a deal to offer you. I'm listening. Help me survive this cancer, and I will give you Dad's entire fortune. Minus, of course, what it takes to sustain my life for 500 years or until they find a cure or whichever comes first. How? It's called cryogenics. You're gonna freeze yourself. You're insane. Nobody has ever frozen themselves and been brought back to life before. Well, it's illegal, so no one's exactly talking about it. There's one man who came very close. How close? Close enough that we're having this conversation. Is he in? He will be. So do we have a deal? Why? I mean, you're 39. I'm gonna inherit everything anyway. Listen, baby brother, this is not a negotiation. If I have to hook myself up to a ventilator machine until I turn 50 just to make sure that you don't get his money, then I will do it. I don't care how much pain I'm in. Are you in? Get your scientist. ♪ Regret on the horizon ♪ ♪ Waiting ♪ [Angelica] You will receive $1 million for the procedure and 500,000 every year I survive for the rest of your life. Oh, and I will, of course, pay for any expenses that are necessary to perform the procedure. Freezing a living human being is illegal. [laughing] Come on, Doctor. Who are you kidding? You froze those human cells for a reason. Because you knew that it would work. Now, someone is gonna go down in history as the person who discovered the secret to everlasting life, and you want that person to be you. The process is completely experimental. I'd have to say your chances of surviving the freezing are 50/50 under perfect conditions. And given your health... The odds of me surviving my cancer without the freezing, Doctor, are zero. Dealing with our mortality is a difficult thing, Ms. Vita. But we all die. We can't control when or how, really, but... eventually, death comes to us all. Says who, exactly? These are inappropriate questions for a doctor, Ms. Vita. I'd be happy to recommend some of the best therapists in the business. You may want to also consider religious... Oh, right, God. You want me to talk to God about it? Should I put it in His hands? Ms. Vita. I can't help you. I'm sorry. Well, I was afraid you were gonna say that. Now, I don't think I have to tell you what those pictures are. I think you already know. [laughs] I'm not a monster, Dr. Ortus. But I will do everything that I have to do to save my own life. Sign the papers. [beeping] [Man, narrating] When we play God, we run from the truth. And the truth is... some things are bigger than you for a reason. Don't mess with what you don't understand. [Radio announcer] Billionaire heiress Angelica Vita has been reported missing. According to a source close to Ms. Vita, the high-profile socialite has not been heard from in over two weeks. The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed an investigation into Ms. Vita's disappearance is in fact underway. [phone rings] Aaron Rossdale. [Woman] Good thing. I was about to report you missing. Pancake breakfast in Sherman Oaks. Mm, that sounds fun. Yeah, you can thank my dad for that one. So you do still work here, right? Because this Thompson brief has to be filed tomorrow, and I'm not a lawyer, so I would really... Speaking of... got a little surprise for you. Hmm. A new job? Yeah, yeah, very funny. I'm on my way. Just one more stop. Thanks for coming. You know, I'd pour you one of these, but you and I both know that's a waste of time. How long are you gonna keep doing this? As long as it takes. Hey, Bill, give me one more. No. No, no, he's done. He's done. So I hear you got the Angelica Vita case. Yeah. Yeah. It's a pretty big deal. Well, you know, this buddy of mine introduced me to her brother Lance. Angelica Vita's brother? No. These are bad people. Right? These are bad people. Listen, I didn't ask for your opinion. Fine. Look. He took this bottled water company and, I mean, they couldn't give the stuff away to the Sahara. And the next thing, he gets involved and the stock doubles, and they haven't even put the product out yet. I figure if he can do that for water, he can definitely help Will. Trevor. Hey, man, Will's dead. But his music is not. Matter of fact, Will died six months ago today. Look, in my job, I see a lot of tragedy. I mean, I see bad, bad things. And my job is to find who is at fault and hold them into account. That is my job. And I am very good at it. Now, listen to me. Look. What happened to Will was an accident. It is not your fault. Come on, man. You know, it's all good, man. It's all good. I'm gonna take you home. What was the name of that bottled water company? Speak of the devil. We have... For free, mind you... The endorsement of the world's biggest celebrity. This guy's name I.D. is off the charts. A figure who will never be in a scandal. Whose reputation is perfect. I mean, what's the competition gonna do? Argue water with the one who created it? Come on. Here's the tag. "God water." "Perfect refreshment" "from the one who invented perfection." What do you think, Gord? I'm curious. What exactly did you say to Angelica before she was frozen? I'm not interested in discussing my conscience. Okay. What would you like to discuss? Water. Ah. You want me to tell you it's okay to use God to sell tap water. I don't think He minds. Would you? That depends what my take is. I thought you knew me better than that. Oh! Look out! Heads up! I hope you sell a lot of those things, 'cause I'm not cheap. So long as you're a better lawyer than a golfer. I know you're the best. Which is why I'm gonna pay you whatever it takes to win. Now we're talking. Have you read the will? Have I read the will. You know that sister of yours? She didn't do you any favors, did she? I don't care what she told you. All right, look, your father's will's not gonna be an issue, okay? It's cut and dry. His estate went into a trust for your sister, none to you. Should she die before the age of 40, you become the sole heir. Perfect. She's 39. Right. But she's not dead, Lance. No one is gonna find her. True. Now she's only missing. No one is gonna see her for 500 years. What more do they want? What more do they want? Did you just ask me that? They want a body. That's what they want. This is Angelica Vita we're talking about here. All right? Her disappearance is the biggest vanishing act since what, Howard Hughes? People are gonna want some answers. And after one look at that will, you are gonna be suspect number 1, my friend. [grunts] Yeah, that's not good. Good afternoon. Jake Russell, Los Angeles Police Department. You've got 90 seconds. Don't sit. You're wasting time, detective. Down to 83 seconds. Angelica Vita went missing and hasn't been heard from since. I have a TV. Tell me what I don't know. Two weeks prior to her disappearance, she made a series of phone calls to a Dr. Richard Ortus. She had cancer. People with cancer call doctors. Dr. Ortus is not an oncologist. He's a cryogenics expert. Two days before he arrived, she filed ten different trusts in the Cook Islands, all funded with exactly the same amount of money... $24.2 million. The contents of the trusts are sealed, but we do know that they all have the same executor, Petros Demetrios. He's a Greek national, long time confidant. Demetrios personally runs seven of her largest companies, mainly in tourism, hotels, and shipping. Three days after her disappearance, one of these trusts transferred $1 million to a company in Switzerland known as Endless Horizon. That company then transferred $1 million to a company in Hong Kong known as Infinity. Infinity has made payments to only one person since its founding one year ago. Ortus. Where's the crime? The trusts have also been making payments to a factory in La Paz, Mexico. Well, is Ortus on the payroll? No. Your 90 seconds is up, detective. [grunts] That one kind of hurt. I got people. You got people? What does that mean, you got people? What are you, my echo? Yes, I have people. That's nice, you have people. Why don't you go talk to your people? Why are we here? What are we doing here? Selani. So let me get this straight. If my sister turns 40 before we can get her declared legally dead, I don't get a cent? Technically, yeah, that's pretty much how it works. But that's why you're gonna hire me, see. We'll start with the 250 grand from your holy water deal there as a retainer. 10% of the estate. Oh, yeah, look at that one. Look at that one! Yes! Oh. When it's transferred into your name, of course. That's what I'm talking about. Get a hearing. Consider it done. You know, maybe you're a lefty. Aaron Rossdale actually completed a brief before it was due. What's next? An interview with the L.A. Sun, no less. Ah, not the Stanton case. No. Your favorite case of all. You. The L.A. Sun wants to interview me about me. Well, apparently, there are people out there who think you should be the new D.A. Hmm. Nah, I don't want to talk to a reporter today. I think you'll want to talk to this reporter. And why is that? She's smart and beautiful and read by 16 million voters. No. No, no. You haven't even gone on a date since I started working here. What constitutes a date? She'll be here at 3 p.m. today. You're fired. How cute is this? It has leggings. Ruched leggings. So you're gonna go off and do your very first interview and you're not even gonna tell me who it is? Just some prosecutor that wants to be D.A. Not Aaron Rossdale. Yeah. He's, like, the Atilla the Hun of lawyers. That guy would get Santa Claus 15-20 for breaking and entering. Oh, come on, he's not that bad. Is he? Did you even do any research on this guy? He has a 98% conviction rate. The highest of any other prosecutor in the history of L.A. County. And since he's joined the D.A.'s office, the crime rate has decreased by 40%, with the murder rate being three times lower than before he arrived. [laughs] Yeah, well, the fun rate's dropped to zero. Well, there's two sides to every story. Look, all you really need to know is that his daddy ran for governor about ten years ago and lost. And ever since then, he and Mommy Dearest have been trying to get Junior into the seat Daddy couldn't win. Plus, he's cute. What? Alice. We've been down this road before, sister. Okay, that was kind of out of line. I am a professional. God help you. What? Your critics say you're too aggressive in your prosecutions. Oh, boy, here we go. In fact, criminals you've convicted average 25% more jail time than other criminals convicted of similar charges. How do you respond to that? Well, it depends on your perspective. Is it with the criminal? Or is it with the victim? I'm with the victim. You asked for and achieved life in prison for Victor Ramirez for stealing $150. Mr. Ramirez did steal $150. He also beat and tortured 80-year-old Alphonse and Maria Blanco in their own home. You see, we as a society have to make a choice. Are we gonna tolerate this kind of garbage, or are we gonna send a message? Victor Ramirez got that message. And the people of Los Angeles are better off for it. What about Mrs. Ramirez and their children? Mr. Ramirez made a choice. His children will have to do the same. One bad choice? No second chances? Depends on the choice. You like her. Come here, sit down. Get a dozen roses at that address before she gets there. I'll take you and Roger to dinner anywhere you want to go. Oh, you really like her. Just get the flowers. A dozen roses? Welcome to politics. I think he's sweet. So's arsenic. Oh. Hi, baby. You're not gonna call him, are you? Already did. Alice. Uh, hey, this isn't a game. [phone rings] And that would be him. Yeah. Don't be mad. I gotta... So you must think I'm really gonna make you look bad. I don't care what you make me look like. I just want you to go on a date with me. Do not go on a date with him. Can't go out on a date with you until the story comes out. Okay, fine. When does it print? Wednesday. All right. How about Thursday night? Yeah. Thursday night sounds amazing. Perfect. Okay. Hey, you're being ridiculous. He's a really nice guy. I didn't ask for this, you know? It wasn't like I woke up this morning and said, "Today, I'll go out and have an affair." I mean, Natalie just never understood me, you know? This place can be the land of the lost. Where you can go to forget. Or to be forgotten. The problem is that while you can be forgotten, you can never forget. I didn't sign up for a baby. Do me a favor. Will you sign this? Is this for your wife or your girlfriend? Go home to your family. You could've signed that, you know. I could do a lot of things. And yet... you don't. Why is that? I don't know. Isolation feels good when we're hurting. Pain is an intimate emotion. One you don't want to share or even expose. Reach out. If we don't, we are lost to our own madness. [heart beating] You look tired. Sleep is important. Keeps us focused. You're not real. How many of those are you taking, anyway? Acute manifestation of my subconscious, as has transferred into hallucination. Amn't I worse than that? Mexico. It's a little far for our jurisdiction, don't you think? It's all right here. The yacht's in her name, and he's living on it. Look at the phone records. They never even spoke until a month before her disappearance. Now he's living on her yacht. She is not dead. So. She's frozen. That is not a homicide. Look, if we can prove that Ortus is taking money from one of Vita's companies, then we got a conspiracy to defraud. We get Ortus, we find Angelica. That's huge. Just need a search warrant. We'll take it to the D.A.'s office. If there's this much money involved, there's a conspiracy. Let's take a look at the brother. He's got motive. You're the boss. Until you become D.A., and then you'll be too big for us little people. Don't hold your breath. You got my vote. Elizabeth, you're too good to me. There is one thing. You know what? Save it. I got my parents' anniversary tonight. I gotta pick up Alice at 7. It's about Alice. You know what? Don't tell me. You're destined to be D.A. You know that. After that, mayor. The mayor, the governor. After that, who knows? But the one thing that can keep you from where you want to be is a scandal. Let's get something straight. I haven't done anything. If there are gonna be skeletons in your closet, make sure the bones are yours. I'm sorry. [baby crying] I'll get her. Thanks. [crying] I've got the good news this time. I'm pregnant. I didn't sign up for a baby. It's okay. Sorry I'm late. It was a crazy day at work. Wow. You look so handsome. What's wrong? You know what? Let's go inside. No, it's your parents' anniversary. We're gonna be late to the party. We've... No. I have never been inside. Not once. Is it that big of a deal? Is it that big of a deal? We're gonna fight... That you have a daughter. That you never told me about. Yes, Alice. It is that big of a deal. Get in the car. Get in the car. [church bell chimes] So what's the problem? I can't help thinking she's still in love with him. Spencer was not a man to her. He was an object. A graven image hung on the wall. And worshipped. What is it that really bothers you? That she worshipped him? Or that she didn't worship you? I don't know. Hi, there. Is your father home? How'd you get past the gate? Your father gave me the code. Tori, that's enough. Whatever. Let's talk in the studio. Your daughter's a charmer. Right.

"It's not jealous or boastful" "or rude." So you're fighting. It's not what is said. It's what's not. I'm curious. How... How could she say anything that would change her past? She can't.

Some people are just easier to love than others. [All laugh] Fair enough, fair enough, fair enough. "It does not rejoice in injustice, "but rejoices whenever the truth wins out. "Love never gives up.

No, you can't, can you? And why is that? They think that they're entitled. Entitled? Or is it that you believe that Ortus killed your wife? Oh, come on, Jake. How can I send a bunch of detectives in the field if I don't know everything about them? She was in grad school. She was offered a thousand dollars to participate in an experiment with Dr. Richard Ortus. He told her that it was an experiment in cryogenic anesthesia.

"Steal" is such a subjective word. I mean, a harsh, harsh word. To be brutally honest, your last album bombed. Your tours, they can't even fill a club, while his... his filled stadiums. You haven't had a number 1 single in what, 18 years? Yeah, I mean, do you honestly think you can make this happen? I can make the sun rise in the west. So... what do you say? You know what? Get to work. Good choice. Yes, I told him to use his dead son's song to promote his career. And no, I don't have any guilt about that. So you're not stealing it. I'm giving Trevor Evans his wildest dream. You're telling me his son wouldn't want that? You're not being honest with me. I am the most honest person you know.

All that matters now is whether you want everyone you've ever met to learn that you fathered a child with one of your patients, only to abandon them. Or let that secret stay a secret forever. What do you want me to do? Testify. What? My sister wanted to die. Why do you care? You've got far bigger problems than that. Don't you, Doctor? See you in court. It doesn't matter what he said. It doesn't matter what he offered you. Perjury is a crime. And you will be prosecuted. He got to the doctor. How do you know? Should've seen his face. Whatever they got on him, it's good. So what's the doctor's story? He says that Vita was depressed from the terminal cancer. Most likely went to an exotic destination and committed suicide or died of the cancer in private. What if he's telling the truth? He's not. Are you willing to bet your career on that? She's in Mexico. You know it, and I know it. And she did it to herself. And we're never gonna be able to do anything about that. You coerced a man into lying under oath. I convinced a liar to tell more lies. Hello, Lance. The detective is no liar. Detective Russell lacks perspective. One million dollars. It'll attract too much attention all at once. But after a couple years, you'll get everything. I don't want your money. Come on. That's rash. Who'll get the money if it doesn't go to me? Hmm? No one. Is that what you want? Losing a wife, that changed you, didn't it? Because something has to make sense, doesn't it? It can't be so random that someone like me has everything while someone like you has to suffer so much. Something has to balance it out, doesn't it? It's justice. Right, detective? Feels good to make this about her, doesn't it? This is about her. It's about you. I'm not the one who's dead. No. But if you keep this up, you will be. Do you know my father cut me out of his will? He was abusive. My father. In just about every way possible. I decided enough was enough. Angelica didn't. I'm not a shrink. Ever remarry? No. One million dollars. I get my money, and you get a new life. [balls clank] How'd you know about my wife? I can't stop thinking about her. The painting she was working on. I never took it down. Clothes are still in the closet, exactly where she left them. She's still there. She's still there. No. She's gone. The problem is... so are you. God help me. Thanks, Bill. Have fun. To the new tour. Been a long time. Too long. Taking these with you? Eh, I'm good. Is that so? So tell me. Late at night, when you're all alone in that big hotel suite, and the adrenaline of the cheers from the crowds have long subsided, and all you are left with are the haunting sounds of your son singing "On and On"... what then? [Man] Truth is like water. It washes away the dirt and the filth of lies and deception. But we can't live on water alone. Peace is what sustains us, like a warm meal. [Russell] Everett was in on it. You have been lied to. And you have been deceived. The truth will wash that away. But, Jake, you must find peace. And in that absolution you will be healed. You've got 90 seconds. That's a bit dramatic, don't you think? You could ask for a transfer. Why didn't you tell me? Because you have yet to understand the difference between what is legal and what is justice. This is not justice. Really? For Lance, it was. He got what he should have been given a long time ago. It was a good deal he offered you. You should have taken it. You tipped off Ortus. Then you tipped off Lance. Then you undermined my testimony after I left, didn't you? What about you? What did you want? Absolution. [door closes] I see that the party wants to nominate you for the D.A.'s office. Congratulations. Thank you. What does Alice think about all of this? I don't know. I see. And why is that? It's complicated. [Lance] Today, I made $1.78 billion. Billion with a B. And how do you feel? I don't feel anything. And you wonder why you're not happy. When a stone falls into a pond, it's not one act. It's the beginning of a thousand ripples. One simple act creating a wave that can drown this entire city. What do you want me to do? Make it right. Get out. Jake, this is final. This cannot undo what has been done. [phone rings] [rings] Pick up the phone, Jake. [ringing continues] Answer the phone, Jake. [ringing] Answer the phone, Jake. Jake, answer the phone. Answer the phone, Jake. [rings] [ringing] Hello. Hi, this is Charlie Lewis. We have a special show today. Joining us will be rock legend Trevor Evans, who's here to tell us the exclusive story that he did not write the hit song "On and On." Tune in to find out who did. You know, why does anybody do something that they know they're going to regret? What now? This is not the end. Not even close. When you debuted the song "On and On" on my show a few months ago, there was real emotion there, you weren't faking it. ♪ [piano] Yeah. You know what? There was emotion. See, it's never really over. It's just all about second chances. [Tori] Daddy. Daddy. Will you teach me how to play "On and On"? You know what, sweetie? Hang on, I'll be right there. "On and On," now that's a song. The investigation's over. You're free and clear. Clean slate. How long were you married, detective? Seven months. Seven months. What's this? When things happen to you, when people do things to you, you look back and you ask yourself how do they get away with that? Well, today, I got justice for my father. But I didn't get peace. So what's in the bag, Lance? Answers. I found that at my sister's place. Looks like Angelica blackmailed Ortus with the details of your wife's death. I thought you might want to know what happened. Once and for all. Thank you. Ask yourself, detective, if tomorrow is gonna be the day that changes everything. That's absolution. [Man] Hey, folks, look, I'll tell you, people have come after Rossdale with everything they've got, but absolutely nothing will stick. They tried to stick him with the lack of arrests in the Vita investigation. They blamed him for his hard sentences. They called him a spoiled daddy's boy. They even criticized his dating habits. But what these clowns don't understand is that Aaron Rossdale is exactly what the voters have been screaming for. The only mistake that he's made in this entire campaign is that he should've skipped the D.A. and run straight for the governorship. [Everett] You're destined to be D.A. After that mayor. The mayor, the governor. [Trevor] You've been waiting your whole life for this moment. Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors. Hey, Aaron, come over here, boy. Want you to meet the future governor of California, my son Aaron. Nice to meet you. [Assistant] You like her. [Alice] One bad choice, no second chances? [Eva] If you love her, yes. [Alice] What's wrong? [Trevor] You don't need anymore baggage. That's how you end up like me. [Man] The politician. The lawyer. You can't love by the letter of the law. Are you a good man? Hello? Hello? Where are you? Where are you? You're not here. You are not here. I have done everything you have ever asked of me, and you are not here. That's how it's going to be, huh? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? [knocking] Hey. I'm gonna go grab lunch. Yeah. Yeah, sure thing. You know, listen. The Sun wants a comment about that God Water guy getting the inheritance. Sun. Yeah. I can't talk to her. No. Alice quit. She's moving to Chicago. This is the new guy. He seems like a real pit bull from New York. Do you want to call him, or should I schedule something when I get back? When did she quit? I don't know. I... I just found out when the new guy called. I didn't really think you'd want me to tell you. No. No, it's okay. Okay. She's leaving on the 5:40 flight to Chicago, TransAir. What? I couldn't help it. I had to know. So she's moving back with her parents. They drove the furniture back last week, and now she and the baby are meeting them there this afternoon. Aaron, this is your last chance. We are now boarding all rows for flight 712 nonstop service to Chicago. [baby fusses] Once again, this is your final boarding call for flight 712, nonstop service to Chicago. Boarding all rows. Don't go. I can't. They're calling for us. She's beautiful. I can't do this. This is not real. I can't have drama anymore. My parents are in Chicago. I have a daughter to think about. And I owe it to her to give her a normal life. Alice, I'm sorry. Aaron, you can't just come here and expect... Alice, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All my life, I wanted to be somebody. But how can I be somebody if I can't be with the someone I love? It's too complicated. I'm sorry. I can't do this. I have to go. No. Me, too. I'm going to Chicago, Alice, whether you like it or not. We are closing the gates, ma'am. Well, close them, then. And put that ring away. Okay. But not too far away. What does that mean? It means you better have a stroller. Because ours is on its way to Chicago. Okay. We're not gonna rush into this. Good. We're gonna get married. Yes, you are. Why'd you help me? Why did you ask me to help? Hey, who are you? I am. What do you want me to do? In the end, the one thing you've always wanted... was the only thing you've always had. For I am with you, always. ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Salvation is here ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Salvation is here ♪ ♪ Now by faith we sing ♪ ♪ The light has come Give praise to the King ♪ ♪ In Him we find our life ♪ ♪ Illuminate the darkest of nights ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Salvation is here ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Salvation is here ♪ ♪ Oh hallelujah ♪ ♪ Halle... ♪ ♪ ... lujah ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Halle... ♪ ♪ ... lujah ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Salvation is here ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Salvation is here ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Salvation is here ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Salvation is here ♪ ♪ I feel like screaming at you something ♪ ♪ Just to hear my own voice ♪ ♪ I fear my screaming will do nothing ♪ ♪ You've made your choice ♪
