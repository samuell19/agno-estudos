- There you go El-Hajj. - God bless you, El-Hajja. Where are you from? Adrar. Adrar or Reggane? - Reggane? - No. - Adrar? - Yes. They are good people. Where are you from El-Hajja? Me? I'm from here, from El Menia. - Do you work by yourself? - Yes, I work alone. May God give you strength! - You don't have kids or anything? - I have no kids, no parents. Nothing... - I am all by myself. - You have God. - God is beside you, right? - Praised the Lord. And he brings you good health, right? You are part of... ...of the Zawiyya. With all your efforts, you are among the best persons on earth. Despite your age, you don't lean on anybody. You work hard by yourself. Where are you going El-Hajj? - I am going to Adrar, inchallah. - May God protect you! May God be with you too! May He bless you even if it's not much! As long as you accept your fate... As long as you are not angry and you keep going. - I am happy with everything God gave me. - That's a proof of your faith. If I don't hold on to God, who can I count on? But some people, they are angry at Him, God forgive them. - As if He owes them something. - I put my fate between God's hands. He tests them. I accept my fate, whatever it is. - Do you have some tea? - I do, El Hajj. Let me heat it. - Give it to me cold. - You want it cold? It's too cold. I don't want to impose. - There you go, my brother. - Thanks El Hajja. - How much do I owe you? - 90 dinars. An omelet, tea... Are you sure? - Maybe you are wrong. - No, I am never wrong. 30 dinars for tea and 60 for the eggs. Here are 100 dinars, you can keep the change. Thanks. May God help you, may He bless you with his wealth. You left your own wealth! May God strengthen your faith! People of the Sahara are out there now. They have fancy cars. Before they were nothing. They can afford good brands now. First time I see a woman owning a coffee shop! What about the blind woman at Boukbour? You know the blind woman? - She is gone. - She died. I knew her in 1989. Aren't you afraid of wolves here? I am not. I have dogs. They protect me. From four-legged wolves! What about the ones with two legs? Ah! The inhabitants of El Menia! The four-legged wolves are easy to scare with dogs. The inhabitants of El Menia calmed down. They leave me alone. Since they built the prison. Just like that! Safe travels. Godspeed! Brave man... Two-legged wolves. - Bekkouch Lakhdar is on your way? - It's on the road of Skikda. You go towards Aïn Cherchar and then Bekkouch Lakhdar. - You exit at Azaba? - Yes Aïn Cherchar, Bekkouch Lakhdar. Bekkouch Lakhdar used to be called Gaston. Soldiers... I wander where they've been. Those soldiers, they were watching the Qataris. - So they work here? - The Qataris live here like kings. In your own country. What work? They have money. They are here to hunt. They hunt gazelles, rabbits, birds... - Are there still gazelles here? - Yes there are some. - Less than before, no? - Yes less than before. When you hunt a species too much, it disappears. There was this guy, called the man with the sickle. He was completely nuts, you know him? - No. - You didn't get to know him. One day, he came here. I asked him to give my nephew a ride. I gave him a leg of... Gazelle. They took it, grilled it and ate it on the road. He told me: "oh! It tastes like cheese!" Gazelle's meat is tasty. I love my daughter, I love her. I love her, I love her, I love her. If I go, would I take you with me? Tell me. You come with me? True? When I leave, my heart stays with you. Mimi. What's the matter with you? There is someone there. Maybe he is coming here. The first time, he came looking for his brother. He pretended his brother went mad and gone missing. That he used to teach at Setif and was from Blida. And he was looking for him here. He came back few days later... I asked him where was his brother. He hadn't found him. He went to Timimoun to look after him Salam my brother. How are you? Praise the Lord, I am fine. I am in the Sahara. All is fine. I am by El Menia. 60 km on the road to Tamanraset. I am spending the night here. Sandstorm, brother. The sandstorm is too strong. Tell them how you started. I am a driver since 1981, do the math. I can't read nor write. I only drove over a dove once, God forgive me. It crashed right on my windshield. I was devastated. - You'll clean later... - No worries. It's all covered with dust and sand. Adventures on the road, I had a few. I saw many things. I saw drug addicts, drunken people driving. I exit the road and leave them behind me. Once I "sanded", I avoided the accident. I went toward the sand and he just went his way. As if nothing happened. I couldn't get out, I had to spend the night there. In the morning, I was towed by a truck. Thank God, I had water and something to eat. Is there, dear brothers, a better thing than youth's will? Is there something stronger than youth's will to overcome the desert and get rid of all the obstacles that you faced while you were building this road. We can definitely say that the country is in good shape. Yes it's in good shape, indeed. The revolution is well as long as we can see in this country and in each part of this nation this kind of faces and strong arms and goodwill who work, who build and achieve things, with one slogan: a revolution by the people for the people! They are about to open a restaurant here. - Where? - Next door. - A restaurant and a coffee shop. - That's good. It's good to keep the place busy. - Do you know who is going to open it? - Who? The guy from Mansoura. - You mentioned him before. - The guy from Ouargla. A gas station is a good thing. Those who drive through, they take gas at El Meniaa at km 40 or Hassi Lefhal. We can find gas everywhere now. It's good to keep the place busy, people will spend the night here. They already do. Still, it's a good thing to have a gas station. If you say so. So, it's a good thing for Malika? Of course she is good, she is filling this no man's land. He is asking you about the gas station and the restaurant. No, he is talking about you. He is asking if it's good for me. He is talking about you. They are taking the bread and butter from me. They can't do that. Only He can do that. He gives and takes. It might even help your business. People know him anyways. God decided things to be this way so you can work even more. You won't lose your bread and butter. Here come the Indians and the Apaches. You have cookies? Yes, cookies, wafers, anything you want. We look at the world. Do you see how vast and big the Sahara is? You see the ergs there? I used to walk there and come back. Oh, yes Mimi! She likes playing in the sand. Diana is coming. Get up! She is jealous. Come here Diana! - 1977. - 1997! I came here in 1994. I know. I put a stone here, my grounds. You settled also in Ouargla? Right? When the inhabitants of El Menia stole from me, I went there. Just for few days. - I stayed there two months. - I thought so. Those dogs from Ouargla! They stole my things, my gas... They said rumors about me without seeing anything! God will be their judge. If I was a women of lust and immorality, I wouldn't be here! Sleeping and waking up on my own. All she says is true. I swear. They said I was living in sin, selling alcohol and bringing women. I hate women, I can't stand them. Those who will burn in hell, it will be because of this. Their tongue. You know how it's called? Tarnish women's virtue. They should watch their tongue! During the terrorism years, Laouaar and his gang. They never did me wrong. They didn't say anything about me. They came here to have food. I know. One day Laaouar met a group here and stole everything from them: money and fuel. And told them to leave me alone, that I was a saint. - How is it to work in the Sahara? - What work? - Well, the work that you do. - Transportation? It's not like it used to be. We work for nothing, just to survive, that's it. Serum not to die. The people of Medea killed the market. I am telling you. The price of the gas is up. Our salary should be rising too but it's the opposite because there is no work. The market is paralyzed, dead. No jobs anymore, my brother. A trip Algiers-Tamanrasset, you don't even make 7000 dinars a day. If you count the gas, oil, your sweat and everything. Not even 7000 DA. Transportation is dead. The market is dead. You're not unemployed and you don't die. Serum, drop by drop. People see you drive a truck and they think... - That he has money. - A gold mine. The goose and the golden egg, you know the story? While there is nothing. May God help us! Amen. That's all we can say. May God help us and help this country and his people. And bring us a good man who will straighten out this country. May He get rid of those traitors who are stealing our country. Stealing their own country just for money. The Indians are coming. Here are the Indians. Look how she travels all by herself. An Arab wouldn't... Her clothes, her camping where she sleeps. Morocco... three month. We thought Indians were coming. Do you have a phone to sell? I am looking for a phone to buy. - Is it your daughter? - No my mom. Look at her mom. Your father? Look, poor her. Look Hassen, her father. She is sitting by his side and holding him in her arms. You are an only child? No other kiddos? Hassen, speak with her in English. No kiddos, no. Very beautiful name. It's beautiful. Malika, do you know what Maya means? No I don't. She is gone. She travels from country to country. She looks like a man. A man's body... a man's face... everything is masculine. She is in her dreams. Welcome to my region, dear visitors How is this region called? Sixty! Sixty? Welcome to our region, dear visitors, at Sixty our star is shining Our green land is not empty, welcome to the nice people worth praise Enter Enter, and see our paradise with flowers Enter, you who are longing for tenderness - Do you have any cold water? - I didn't turn the fridge on. - No cold water then. - Here, on the floor. It's still too cold out, I don't turn it on. - How much I owe you? - 50 dinars. Godspeed! Safe travels! Hello, yes, fine? They threw me out of my house, they took all my wealth. Why would I go and see them? They threw me out on a holiday, why would I go and see them? Some people care more about me than my parents do. I won't go anywhere! I swore that I wouldn't go back. What would I do at their place? So, are you fine? Each time I feel anxious, I call you. Please God, help me! Malika! It's Souleiman, his neighbor. Do you understand French? ...little brother, yes. He is your neighbor? No it's my little brother. And now you are leaving? Or are you going to some other town? I am here for a bit, inchallah. - And then, where will you go? - Then I'll go back home. You told me that you would come with us to Algiers. And now you tell Malika that you are going back to your country? That's not how we do it Souleiman! Don't' zigzag! Mohamed, he doesn't zigzag, you are zigzagging too much. I said I was here for a bit. I'll use the opportunity to visit Algiers. Hey, Rachid! You rascal! You crook! Do you like Algeria? I like Algeria! There is a lot of money here, right? Yes, a lot of money, a lot of work... And in your country there is no job? There is some, but not like this. Not like in Algeria? There is a lot of money in Algeria. You are here with us for work, how does it go? Thank God, since we entered your firm, we didn't have any problem at work or with people. It's the same for everybody. Because if you work, you earn your salary, there is no problem. You found everything. Algeria is good? Thank God. They are sending them back home these days. Yes, I know. - They brought 37 buses last week. - Yes, 38 buses. Last week they were coming from Constantine and Mila. They brought them from the east. I was in a minivan. The driver told me that they took those from Constantine and Mila. And the week before, it was Oued Souf and Biskra. 29 buses the week before. They deport them each time. They take them to the Transit Center of Tamanrasset. They make them cross the border. No more tea El-Hajja? - Nope. - Nothing? What about coffee and milk? There is nothing left. It's dark know, people are about to sleep. Okay. Poor them. One dead man in the bus. And here again a victim, a woman. Here is the "Kabyle". A real tragedy this accident. You didn't see it? We did go to see it. No, I didn't want to stop. I passed through. - Did he roll over? - Yes, in the night. - They told me it happened at 1 AM. - I don't know, I was sleeping. I didn't hear anything. - He was doing Biskra-Adrar. - Yes, I see him sometimes on the road. He rolled over this night. No, there was another accident this morning. What can we do? They speed up. True, we see how they drive fast. - The driver ran away. - He was scared. What else could he do? It's naturel, he got scared. So what's going on? - We went to Friday prayers. - Really? - Chawki too? - Yes. That's when President Boumediene, poor him, inaugurated the road of African Unity, just right here. He drove here, close to the sign. Then he got back in his DS and he was gone. And now we don't see their faces anymore. And when they come it's only by plane. The gas station is building up. - The gas station is building up quickly. - Yes I know. He has all the paperwork now? Yes. - He is opening soon? - Yes, soon. Ryadh! You want some tea? - You want some tea? - Yes. Tea for two then! Have a look here. Did you put this number, the 143? She has an address, Malika. 143 Sahara street. Or Tademaït avenue. We are at Malika's place. ...the gatekeeper of the void. Gatekeeper? You are the Gatekeeper of this void. I am leaving, for ten days and come back. You have neighbors now, it's not a no man's land anymore. Before, it was empty. Now there is the gas station. I have nothing to do with that, it belongs to its owner. And the Syrian who was digging for water there? - He is not here anymore? - He left, I don't know where. He was a nice guy. He helped me once when my car broke down. He gave me fuel. I told you to go and see him. He didn't want to get paid. He gave you 5 liters. Enough to go to El Menia. Was it enough to go there? One liter is more than enough. You were with your girlfriend. Honestly, if I were you, I would marry her. She has everything one needs. She is beautiful, educated, a doctor, what else do you want? Nothing. She got it all. - I am the one who is not mature. - She does love you. I am the one lacking maturity. But she loves you, right? Well, that's what she says. How can I know that she truly loves me? If she didn't love you, she wouldn't stand going from town to town with you. And furthermore in the desert! Eating eggs in the middle of sandstorms. - Sand omelets. - Full of sand! - When you'll get married, I will. - No way to get married, my dear. And you want me to get married? The wedding is long gone. I've got the grave and the white shroud left. - You want to pull it off? - Can I? Yes, it's just a windscreen. Go have a look from there, Chawki! Mrs. Malika is asked to the parlor! Oh my son! How are you? - They gave me six more months. - What can we do? - I stole a cigarette pack in prison. - It's almost over. - Get me a lawyer. - Where do you want me to find you one? You know everybody, you need to get me one. - Hold on! - I can't stand being here anymore. I want to get out. I dream of an egg and fries sandwich. I miss my wife, coffee shops, TV... - They don't have TV? - We only have the national channel. Don't worry my son, at least you have your cellmates. You are going to let your son rot in here? Get me out and I'll give you tuna, a whole truck of tuna. A fresh tuna! Not the one we had under Boumediene! - You are going to steal it again! - I just want out. - And I'll get you married. - I don't give a damn about marriage. - With the prison warden! - The warden, just that! He is a nice guy, he has a car, good salary... - A house by the sea in Annaba. - Nice, nice. I'll go see a lawyer tomorrow. A good one. We'll manage later for the money. The director said he would let me out if someone takes my place. - You gonna take my place? - I can't. You want me to get in? - It's only six months, it's nothing. - You would put your own mom in prison? I'll take care of the shop while you are here. Okay. - Do you have tea? - Yes. - Is he a lawyer? - And cigarettes? We have cigarettes, tea, tobacco, anything you need! Are you a lawyer? - Ask him if he is a lawyer? - Stop being silly! What's all this? - Did you happen to study law? - What? They put me in jail. Can you get me out? - Get in, I'll give you some tea. - Get in, you are welcome here. He is filming us, not the people! What happened with the bus there? There was an accident last night. He was coming from Timimoun? Adrar. What Mouley? I was saying you'll get a competitor soon. - I'll tell you what... - Yes? He'll get tired after two weeks. I know but you seem down! He'll get tired to go to El Menia every day. Forget him, but why do you want to go? I'm fed up, I'm tired. Don't give up! - I spent all my life here... - End it here for what is left! You did what you wanted, do you need anything more? - You have family... - I don't talk to them no more. It's still family, you are not a random branch! Stay here, until they go. Resist. As you always did. If I were younger I would resist, but now... You are blessed by baraka! People don't come for your age. They'll come because they like to come to your place. How many coffee shops did I go by without stopping. And here I am! Why? Because I know you and I wanted to hear from you. They'll eat there and get tea at your place. If you leave, the place will be deserted. Actually someone wants to buy the shop. You are going to sell and leave? - How are you? - Fine. - Do you have cigarettes? - Yes, some Ryms. - Give me two. - Two? I sell the whole pack. - Do you have eggs? - No. Thank God. - Do you read the Coran? - Yes, I am an imam. We read at Adrar. - And you, are you from El Menia? - We are from Algiers. Here is your change. El Hajja, are you from El Menia? No, I am from the East. We are leaving, we leave you at it. We have some road to do. May help you God, El Hajja. - You don't have any family, no kids? - Nobody. I only have God. Our Lord. - You sleep in this house? - I do sleep here, I eat and drink here. - How do you get your groceries? - I go by myself. - Where? - At El Menia. - What's your name? - Malika. Malika... You told me so, I forgot. You should go, it's still daylight and the road is long. Yes, let's go, good-bye! May God protect you! Those people, I swear. All the questions, what do you do, do you live here? Is it a questioning? Do you have kids? You live here? Of course I live here! Did you leave me a place in this world? I am here! I didn't ask anything from you. You came here for tea. Don't ask me question. Just go... "We were at the Zawiya of Belkbir." Leave this holy place alone! They are the hypocrites! They lecture us. They hate women, they hate us. They pretend to pray and they do the pilgrimage of El-Hajj. May God bring you health. We were at the zawiya. - Did you do the ziyara, the pilgrimage? - Yes. - At Adrar. - I know. What do you want me to read to you? The newspaper! What do you want to know? Just read! - Do you understand French? - I don't. Read and tell me the stories. They are saying: This quack who is investing in cancer patients despair. What do they say? It's a fake doctor that scams cancer patients. He's a crook! He plays with people's despair! - Is he from Constantine or Algiers? - Wait, I'll tell you... This seller of dreams is giving life again to an era of miracles and pretends to be the agent of Omar Fati who lives in Yemen. He is from Yemen! It's happening in Yemen, not Algeria? No, they bring the medicine here. It's a Yemeni who lives here and steals people. He wants to rip off people. He tells them: "I found the cure for cancer." Should I go on? Yes, go on. What did they do with this world! With this country! Is it chaos or not yet? Not far from it. It's women's day soon! What? Yes, it's tomorrow. We celebrate tomorrow. Tomorrow is party time. Tomorrow we gather. You know how I celebrate? I have my two dogs and my cat, I'll celebrate with them... Women's day! They say they are giving plenty of rights to women. They are going to pamper them. I don't need rights from the State! What do you want me to do with their rights? I am independent! I don't need their rights, I couldn't care less. What if they come here to see you? And if they come to give you rights? I know they won't give me anything. - You know they will never come? - I know they won't give me anything. For what company do you work? Me? I am not here for work... I have things to do in Timimoune. I am looking for my brother. - Your brother? - Yes. What's with your brother? - He is gone missing. - And you look for him in Timimoun? That's what they told me. - What? - They shouldn't talk. Each time, I am told he is somewhere different. - And you can't find him. - I can't, no. So you are looking for your brother? I am looking and I can't find him. - Is it him? - Yes, it's my brother. And at El Menia, did you look for him? They didn't tell me, but I'll go there maybe. It's as if I was tracing his smell. Someone tells me he is at some place, I go there. It's as if he became a smell. Maybe they took him somewhere and they killed him. They killed my daughter. - She was thrown away. - Your daughter? - Who killed her? - What? How do you want me to know? She was home on her own and they killed her... That's it. I am all alone now. She used to come and visit from time to time. Now that she is dead, nobody comes to see me. I have no smell anymore. I only have her. If they kill her, I'd be lost. Mimi! If they kill you what would I do? Mimi, my daughter! They took your sister! They killed my Bouciya and left me all alone. - How much do I owe you? - I need to do the math. - It's going to cost you! - No problem, just say it... He is making fun of us. He says that his brother is gone I don't know where... It's not true. I did also make fun of him. - It's not true? - It's not. People lie but they don't know how. - They are opening in April. - And the store? It opens on March 15th. They told me he is working with a guy from the region of Kabylie. I don't know, it's the one from Mansoura. Yes. They talked about him. The cafeteria is done, the earthenware too. - It's not gonna work out. - His other coffee is dead too. When I went to Algiers, I stopped on the way there, it was empty. That's what I've been told. I don't know if it will work here. Let me tell you, it will work the first three weeks. But if it's as expansive as there, clients will run away. The people here cook for themselves. So he is opening soon, inchallah. Everything is ready, the pumps, the tanks, the generators are done. Even the power is in there. Well, good for them... If you comeback, it will be open. - They won't comeback. - You could fill up your tank here. Get half-full in El Menia and come in peace. - You will still be the custodian? - Inchallah. - We'll stay together then. - They are my cousins. We will keep each other company. - Someone is coming... - Thank you. - Can we find an agreement now? - I am telling you that I won't go! But home, they told me that you were waiting for me! No, they did not. - Have I ever lie to you? - No, you haven't. Nacer told me that you wanted to come. But I won't go now. - Why? - It's not the right time yet. Please, just tell me why you don't want to come? I won't go! - You've been saying this for a year. - It's not the right time. I've been at the hospital few days ago, have you heard? - I was sick. - Like the last time you came? Yes, like the time I stayed at your sister's. She was there for me more than my own sister. She even washed my feet! She's been more than a sister to me. I swear, she asked me to bring you back. - Who? Siham? - Yes. I told her about my circumstances. I won't come! Don't waste your time. Don't worry Malika, you won't travel in the van. We will take you to Tamanrasset and you'll take the plane. - I won't take neither the plane nor... - You will land in Constantine. - I won't take neither the plane nor... - Wait... The van doesn't bother me. What do you like here? What keeps you here? It's all I've got. You are saying there is no work anymore. I work a bit. There is no work at all! I pretty well know there is no work here. I won't go, that's it. - Why? Just tell us why? - I am staying here. I am staying here facing the dunes. Contemplating the sand. Here is the Tourist Office. They bring some tourists. They are gone? They parked. What's going on? Tell my mom not to cry O you, the exiled That her son is gone and won't come back O you, the exiled They took me to trial O you, the exiled Small and big cops O you, the exiled I took one year and a day O you, the exiled Tell my mom not to cry They took us through seven doors Behind the seventh, we found the braves They gave me a blanket and a bench Tell my mom not to cry O my heart why this disgust? It's always the same soup Tell my mom not to cry
