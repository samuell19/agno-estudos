[music playing] [music playing] NARRATOR: In the spring of 1965, the United States Marines invaded a Caribbean island called the Dominican Republic. -We are not the interveners in the Dominican Republic. NARRATOR: Every so often, George Moran has this dream about when he was in the Marines. Starts in different ways, but it always ends up the same, running down these streets, trying to kill somebody he doesn't know who's trying to kill him. [music playing] -Cat Chaser, up here! WOMAN [OFFSCREEN]: Tired from chasing too much pussy, Cat Chaser, huh? Too much pussy for you, Cat Chaser! NARRATOR: Well, he'd have this dream two or three nights in a row. It's got to do with getting shot in the Dominican Republic, making democracy safe for Gulf and Western. You probably don't remember that little war. WOMAN [OFFSCREEN]: Come on, Cat Chaser! Up here! Yeah, man! I'll show you some real pussy, come on! GEORGE [OFFSCREEN]: Mrs. Prado, how are you today? You know, you've got a trash can up there on your terrace there. -That's not my name. -Oh? Prado's not your name? Well, that's the name your husband signed when you checked in. -My husband. You think that guy's my husband? He's a Puerto Rican piano player. -Well, whoever you are, we're-- we're happy to have you. Want me to turn on some music? See, we got these little, uh, outdoor speakers now. -I'd like you to beat it and leave me alone. I don't talk to pool cleaners. [radio music playing] JERRY [OFFSCREEN]: [humming to music] -Jerry, what's the name of that tune? -Uh, "Sailing Away On Your Kisses." -Never heard of it. When you get a chance, dumb the garbage for me? -The piano player's back, George. Prado? Yeah, I just passed him. -He's got a case of champagne. Gonna be a big night. -I imagine he needs it with that dame. -Honest to God, another dead soldier in their room. Brandy touchin' bottom. You ought to see how they tear up the bed. Honky SOB. What do I get paid for anyway around here? -Hi ya. Looking for a room. -Sure. Fill out a card. -This is the Coconut Palms Resort Apartments, is that correct? -That's correct. -Then why don't I see any palm tree? -Some bugs ate 'em. -You call this place the Coconut Palms, there isn't a single palm tree out there? Isn't that false advertising? -That'll be $30. You're number five next to the office. -OK. How about if I sit out by the pool and drink my beer, and I don't take your room? How much is that? -That's also $30. For the ambiance and the music. -I don't hear any music. -I haven't turned it on yet. Tell you what, thought. You can take your 6-pack on up the road. Maybe you'll find something more to your liking, a little less expensive. -Being courteous to people who come in off the street, I imagine that can be a pain in the ass sometimes, right? -Can if you let it. NARRATOR: Nolan Tyner. Sounds Irish or made up. He's got a tattoo that says he's Army Airborne, but then again, anybody can get a tattoo. Sometimes you see somebody, and you see yourself going down a road you could have gone down. Sometimes you run a mile, and sometimes you take them a beer. -Here's a cold one for you. Your's must be getting pretty warm by now. -Very kind of you. Halls of Montezuma, huh? -Yeah. I take it you're Airborne? Not by any chance the 82nd? -That's the one. -2nd or 3rd Brigade, maybe? -3rd. You're leading up to something, aren't you? -Matter of fact, I wonder if you were with the 82nd down in Santo Domingo during the rebellion. -You don't mean to tell me you were there? -So you were Airborne? What the hell did I bring you a beer for? -You felt something, a kinship. One grunt snippin' another. -I'm going back there tomorrow. -Where? -Santo Domingo. -Jesus Christ, what for? -I don't know. See if it looks the same. Look up some people. Doesn't seem to be anything going on. Now it's all El Salvador, Nicaragua. -If there's any place we can go in down there and fuck things up, we'll find it, don't worry. -You been back to the DR since? -Man, I ate that chow just one time and got Trujillo's Revenge. I partied with one girl-- one! And took home a dose. I take a vacation, man, I go to Las Vegas where it's sanitary. At least there if you sit on the john, you only lose your wallet, you know what I mean? Well, well! -I'm not going to say it's a small world. -You want to know how small it is? You got a couple Dominicans right up in that end apartment. The, uh, piano player and the broad, the lovers? My sheet says the piano player might be Puerto Rican. -You're sheet? What do you mean, you're "sheet?" -The uh, ID's of the people I got under surveillance. The broad, for example. She's married to a Dominican guy by the name of Andres DeBoya. Miami big bucks, and I mean big. -Wait a minute. That woman up there? -They got a house on Biscayne Bay looks like the fuckin' Taj Mahal, only bigger. -That's right. But that woman isn't Mrs. DeBoya. -How would you know? -Mrs. Andres DeBoya is form the same place I am originally. Detroit. She's no more Dominican than me. Her name's Mary Delaney. She's, uh, a nice looking woman. In fact, she's-- she's a nice person. -Maybe it's a different DeBoya. A relative. -How many Andres Deboyas are there? He's Dominican. DeBoya worked for Trujillo. He's a general in charge of something or other down there, I don't know. -Something or other? Try the head of the fuckin' secret police, man. The Coscos Blancos. How do you know him? Lucadendra Country Club? -I played golf with him a few times. Actually, it's twice, the same foursome. That was enough. -Too rich for your blood, the bets? Little Nassau? -Nah, the guy cheats. You believe it? -How about Mrs. DeBoya? She cheat, too? -Careful. [phone ringing] SPORTSCASTER [ON TV]: Underneath the chatwood. GEORGE [OFFSCREEN]: Go, go, go! SPORTSCASTER [ON TV]: He's got the first down and then some! The 40! [phone ringing] SPORTSCASTER [ON TV]: The 35! -Go! Oh, you mother! Yeah, Coconut Palms. I What's wrong? -Sir, I'm doing the best I can. Please, I-- George! De we have a guest named, uh, Prado staying with us? I don't recall such a name. -Let me see. -Come on, what is this? -What was the name, Pravo? -Prado! Gimmie those, man! Come on, let's see what you got! -I told him, George, that they're private property. I'm not supposed to show this to anybody. -That's right. Besides, we don't want to show 'em to you. -George, we're not getting anywhere fast here, are we? What you got, maybe two units rented? You got lights on in one unit I can see. Maybe you're in there watching a ballgame. Which I wish I was home doing right now myself. We can knock on every door you got, George, you know, but I don't want to wake up any of your guests, cause a commotion. Give the place a bad name. That's where I stand. What I want to know know, George, is where you stand, why you're being uncooperative? Does he owe you rent money? -Come on, George. Cut the shit! -Corky. Go on outside, OK? Go ahead. I can handle this. Fuckin' spics. Somebody told them they have hot blood, they have to live up to it. Don't worry about Corky. I'll put him on a leash if I have to. -Or I could call the cops. -George. The name is Jiggs. Jiggs Scully. I'm an ex-cop myself. City of New York, borough of Manhattan, George. Bet I can talk to the cops better than you can. -Business consultant. -Yeah, now I'm a business consultant. Right now I'm going down to see Mr. Prado. Where you come in-- I'm going to knock on his door, he don't answer it, then I might have to kick it in. I mean, the business I got with him is that pressing, George. -You can knock on the door. He doesn't open it, you don't go in. You can talk to the cops. We'll see how good you are. -OK, pal. He don't open the door, I go home and watch the ballgame myself. How's that sound to you? JERRY [OFFSCREEN]: I didn't like 'em at all, that type. They come into a place, you know they're going to take whatever they want. -Maybe yes, maybe no. -At first I thought it was going to be a stickup. -You better stay by the phone. You look up the precinct number? -Yeah. 785921-- or is it 2911? I don't know what it is, but you better be sure. JERRY [OFFSCREEN]: I know it like my own number. -Jerry, they're coming down. -78592-- wait a minute, 7859-- GEORGE [OFFSCREEN]: Mrs. Prado, is everything all right? -Everything's lovely, George. Go on back to the ballgame. -Mrs. Prado? -George, you got nothing to worry about here. We're gonna go out and have a few pops. You have a nice evening. [music playing] [knocking] GEORGE [OFFSCREEN]: Nolan! [banging on door] -Nolan? Hey. Hey, Nolan! -What's the matter? -Two guys came in looking for the piano player. You hear what I said? NOLAN [OFFSCREEN]: What time is it? -It's about, uh, 10:30. They came out with him and the woman. They said they're going for a drink, but I don't think so. They're putting them into a car, a red and white Cadillac. -You paid up? -Yeah. -So forget about it. What else can I tell you, buddy? -You can cut the buddy shit and tell me what the hell's going on here! Now who's that woman with the piano player? -Hey, you were right. That Dominican broad's not DeBoya's wife. She's his sister, Anita. -There's 1,000 motels on the beach, they picked this one. Why? -I don't know. Come on. I really don't. I was hired to watch Anita, and, uh-- and sort of keep my eyes open. -For what? For what? -[sigh] See who come to visit you. Jiggs said-- you want his exact words? He said, "Keep your eyes open for a broad." -Go on. -Sort of blond-streaked hair, good looking. -About 32? -Yeah, well, he said around 30. -What else you do for money? Anything your told, huh? -There you are! NARRATOR: George had the dream again that night, and in the morning he just headed out, straight for the airport. Well, not quite straight. -George, how we doing? Hey, your team won last night, huh? -Which one was my team? -The Lions. You're from the Motor City, aren't you? -What'd I do? -I don't know, George. Suppose you tell me. Or, uh, tell Mr. DeBoya there. He wants to ask you something. -How much frontage do you have here? -Oh, about 120, 130 feet. I forget. You're talking about a difference of about $200,000. -Numbers aren't my game anymore. How's your golf? DEBOYA [OFFSCREEN]: How much do you want? The real estate guys call up every week are up over $2 million. -I'll give you $2,200,000. -You want me to go away, Andres? Come on, what's your game? Well, whatever it is, the Coconut isn't for sale. I like it. -Why? I asked you why. -I live here. It's my home. -You live in that? -I live in that. I don't know your sister, and I haven't seen your wife in over a year. I want you to understand that. I never made any moves on your wife. Never. NARRATOR: Funny how you can tell the truth and still feel guilty. I guess it has to do with sins committed in the mind being sins just the same. [music playing] AIRPORT ANNOUNCER [ON PA]: Eastern flight number 907 has arrived from Miami at gate 6. [music playing] -Do we have all the suitcases? I-- no, I think we already have them. Where's the map? Remember? You carried it on the plane. -Taxi. -Hi, George! George! GEORGE [OFFSCREEN]: Oh, hi. -Philly. -Yeah, right, Philly. How are you? -How are you? Good to see you. You remember Marilyn and Liz from the club. -Marilin, yeah. Hi, sure. How are you all? What are you doing down here? -We came for the polo matches. [inaudible] You, too? -No, I'm staying in Santo Domingo. Business. -Oh you're staying at the country club? -No, I'm staying at the El Presidente. -Well, if you're in town for a couple days, maybe we could get together for a drink. We'll call you after the polo matches. -I'll be in town a few days, yeah. -Bye. See you then, George. [music playing on radio] GEORGE [OFFSCREEN]: Como se llama? BIENVENIDO [OFFSCREEN]: My name is Bienvenido, senor. GEORGE [OFFSCREEN]: Bienvenido. I got a friend who was here with the 82nd Airborne paratroopers. He says we should have just gone into the old section, the rebel area, and ended the whole thing in 15 minutes. -Ah, yeah. I believe it, too. -You were here? -Um-hum. I always be here. -What side were you on? -This side, three taxicabs ago. -Bienvenido, you do something for me? -Yes, I will. -OK. I want you to put this message in the newspaper, in "Listin Diario," all right? -OK, sure. -Tell them to put a box around it, you know with lines around it so it'll stand out, OK? -Yeah, sure. -And English. -OK, English. -See if you can read it. -"Cat Chaser is looking for the girl who ran over the rooftops and tried to kill him." -Muy bien. You understand? -Cat Chaser? -Well, that's the name of my platoon. It's-- well, anyway, she'll understand, you understand what I'm saying? -Yes, I understand. You want this girl, but, uh, if you can't find her, you want another girl? GEORGE [OFFSCREEN]: [laughing] BIENVENIDO [OFFSCREEN]: Gracias! -Mira. Uh, [spanish]. -[speaking spanish] -[speaking spanish] -[speaking spanish] Gracias. [music playing] Oh, here we go. OK. That's for you, and for you. And that's it, you cleaned me. No mas, I got no more. You got me. NARRATOR: Doesn't seem real to think about running and hiding and never seeing anything unless you're pointing a gun at it, in this very street, these very people. WOMAN [VOICE]: [spanish], Cat Chaser! Cat Chaser! [spanish] WOMAN [VOICE]: [spanish], I'll show you some real nice pussy. Come on, see if you can take it, Cat Chaser! [gunfire] WOMAN [OFFSCREEN]: Yeah! Right here, Cat Chaser! -Hold on, Luci! -Oh, no! [music playing] [explosion] MAN [OFFSCREEN]: Luci, look at your Cat Chaser now! NARRATOR: He remembered the feeling of being a hurt animal, helpless and disbelieving and frightened. [phone ringing] -Hello. [laughing] I don't believe it. Come on, what are you doing here? Where are you? I don't believe it. [music playing] NARRATOR: It was true what he told DeBoya, the he never made any moves on his wife. But they recognized each other from the start. Mary Delaney and George knew where they came from and how they got where they were. They had a guilty secret. When they met at parties and restaurants, they never said much. Towards the end, it was just looks. -Make up your mind, Moran. Are you going to hole me or that beer? -I think we blew a fuse. [music playing] GEORGE [OFFSCREEN]: Will you tell-- tell me what you're doing in Santo Domingo? -I came down in a lot with some of the girls from the club. Polo buffs. -Yeah, right. I ran into them at the airport. You're all staying here? -No. -Not very chic. -We stay at Casa de Campo. -Oh, yeah? What are you doing here? -Well, Phily told me you were staying here. -Yeah? -Mmm. So I thought I'm come say hi. -You came to this hotel just to say hello to me? -Mmm. I came to Santo Domingo just to see you. -You said-- you said you came here for the polo. -I lied. I didn't plan on making this trip. Phily called me last night to try to coax me, and told me that she saw you at the airport. I've bared my soul to you. -It's a nice one. I'm getting excited all over again. What-- what about polo? -[whispering] Polo's boring. [music playing] GEORGE [OFFSCREEN]: OK, so you're telling me why you married him. -I was, um, 28, and all the good guys were taken. -Maybe when you married him, you thought you could change him, turn him into a teddy bear. He's not at all cute, Mary, I'll tell you that. Maybe you thought you could make him cute. -No, that's not true. I think I just decided that he was fascinating, that's all. -What do you think of him now? -I think he puts on that front so nobody will know what a real asshole he is. -So walk away. What's the problem? -Because I told you before, I want him to understand why I'm leaving him. I don't want him to think it's for any other reason except that we shouldn't have been married in the first place. -You don't like the guy. What other reason is there? -I signed a prenuptial agreement. If the marriage ends in divorce for whatever reason, I get a flat settlement of $2 million. -Oh! -So, see? He could think I'm divorcing him for the money. -You didn't want to sign it? -No, George, I didn't. I didn't want to make a business deal with him. I wanted to marry him. -OK. OK. Well, if it was his idea, then it's his idea. If you're worried about what he thinks, I mean, uh, you want to prove your sincerity, then don't take the money. -Yeah. Except I like being rich. GEORGE [OFFSCREEN]: They dragged me into this courtyard. I thought they were going to go kill me. Then the girl brings me a bottle of beer. Says her name is Luci Palma. She's 16, skinny, beautiful. There we were, two kids in a courtyard. An hour earlier, she could have shot me. Now she's bringing me first aid and a bottle of beer. And then you know what she says to me? She says, "Who do you like better, the Beatles or the Rolling Stones?" Rolling Stones?" [speaking spanish] Luci Palma. -Oh, man. No, wait a minute. [yelling] -Can I assist you, Capitano? -Yeah, just tell-- tell them I'm not the one. -I would say, you are the Captiano. -Yeah, look, look, there's not one of them over 30. They're too young! MARY [OFFSCREEN]: I'm going to go wait in the bar. -Wait, don't! Help me! -No, you're doing fine, George. Really. Just stay with it. -OK. [speaking spanish] -If you permit me? -To do what? -My name is Rafael, but most people I'm known as Rafi. I think your friend should know that none of those girls could be Luci Palma. -I think he knows that. I think he's just having a little fun. -That's good. -How did it go? -Well, it was different. [laughing] -Well, if you're through casting, I'd like to introduce you to Rafi. This is the, uh, infamous Marine, Jorge Moran. RAFI [OFFSCREEN]: You've come all the way out here to find Luci Palma. -I just came to Santo Domingo to see it again. You know, as a tourist this time, you know? -You live where, in what state? MORAN [OFFSCREEN]: Florida. Pompano Beach. -Pompano. That's a nice place. -Mmm. Yes, it is. George owns the Coconut Palms. -I think I've heard of it, like the Fontainebleu in Miami. A big place. -Yeah, well, it's not so big, but it's, uh, very classy, if you know what I mean. -Maybe I can be of help, find out where Luci Palma is. -Well, I don't think she's still there. -Oh, yes, yes, I think so. She just lives someplace else, like La Romana, Puerto Plata. I'll-- I'll find out for you. -I appreciate it. I don't want you to go to any trouble. -I just make a few phone calls, I'll find out for you. MORAN [OFFSCREEN]: Well, I just-- -Put it in my hands. Excuse me, but I have business to take care of. I'll call you later. I hope to see the buddy of the Marine again. It's been a pleasure. -I'm surprised he didn't click his heels. -Well, you know, your Dominicans are very, uh, very polite people. -Tell me about it. -That's right, you have one at home, don't you? -Um-hum. [music playing] [speaking spanish] Smile. Relax. Don't slouch like that. [spanish]. Hey, you want to be rich? Huh. You got to learn how to smile. -What do I get? -[laughing] The world. -Hey! You're home! When did you get in? -When did I get in. You're watching me get in. -How was your trip? -Interesting. -I skimmed the swimming pool. -Good. -Didn't find any used condoms. There ain't no alligators. Two broad from Fort Wayne left, and the old couple with the Buick. Nothing's new other than that.. -How about old business? -Latin lovers, they broke up. Huh? -Last time we saw the guy that broke them up, you were treating him to one of my beers. -Jiggs Scully. Ah, he's all right. Nice guy. -Yeah, good old Jiggs. Turns out he works for DeBoya. -Yeah, there's a few things I got to explain to you, George. -Will it take long? -George, that's not nice. You see, Jiggs doesn't exactly work for Deboya. DeBoya just uses him from time to time for the heavy stuff. -Prado, the piano player. That's heavy? -Jiggs is like a bill collector. He's on call. Some guy has an outstanding debt, some drug dealer's skimming, they call Jiggs, and Jiggs straightens it out. -What are you getting into, Nolan? -Me? I'm not getting into anything. -You going to start wearing a black overcoat, pack a gun? -They don't wear overcoats down here, George. You got a cold one in that fridge? -If you left any. -I'm just telling you who's who, that's all. -If you'll excuse me, Nolan, I want to rest and get cleaned up. -Hey, that's right. Now was the trip? -I'll tell you all about it later. -You going to be around? -I don't know. I may go out. -I want to hear all about it, George. What was you're platoon down there, Ass Chaser? You get much this time? -Get outta here. NARRATOR: He should have sent him on his way. Nolan was a ghost, and he didn't need that. Now was when he had to be clean and clear, to believe he and Mary could make it, which is certainly a lot of make believe. -It's a Mr. Delaney. -Who are you supposed to be, a relative? GEORGE [ON PHONE]: Do you have any? -Not around here. They're all up in Michigan. GEORGE [ON PHONE]: Then I'm visiting. I miss you already. MARY [ON PHONE]: I do, too. -Can you talk? -No, not comfortably. GEORGE [ON PHONE]: Have you seen him? -We said hello, yes. -Did you kiss him? MARY [ON PHONE]: Yes, I did. On the cheek. Do you know the Hilton on, uh, Collins? GEORGE [ON PHONE]: Sure, I know where it is. -Be there tomorrow. What time? GEORGE [ON PHONE]: 6 AM. -How about noon? GEORGE [ON PHONE]: I'll be there. Mary? -I love you, George. -Gentlemen, I want you to meet a couple friends of mine. -We had a wonderful time. The weather was perfect. A couple of thunderstorms, but it didn't last. -I saw that, um, that friend of yours. The one with hair like a lion. -You mean Marilyn? -Mmm. -She was with us. When did you see her? -Saw her yesterday. I was going to the club. -And she told you that I would stay an extra day. She didn't say anything about that. Talked to me about polo. -Mmm. -She doesn't know anything about polo. She didn't even know who was in the tournament. -Well, I guess what we really like is the atmosphere more than anything else. -Hmm. Did you see anybody you know? Phyllis got us invited to a-- a party. Mostly embassy people. -You see anybody from here? -Outside of our group? -Um-hum. -No. -You didn't see, um, what his name? That-- that guy that was kick out of the club? The one from your city. -Who, George Moran? What would he be doing in Santo Domingo? How do you, uh, know he was there? -How do I know he was there? Because people tell me. Besides, when I want to find out something, I always find out. You said you were there when he was there, but you say you didn't see him. -Hmm? [phone ringing] -Yes? MARY [ON PHONE]: He knows. NARRATOR: There's nothing like adultery in rented rooms in the afternoon to cure that clean, clear feeling. They knew after just one pass that this wasn't the way to go. Mary said she'd tell him went she want home, but George didn't believe it. You have to be all in one place to do things that straight. There was something in Mary that was split, and if he hadn't known what it was, there was somebody on hand to tell him. -George, how we doing? You know, you mention Andres DeBoya's name to people who know anything about him, it shrivels their balls right up. And if you don't have a pair of the biggest ones in town, I don't know who does. What do you say we have a drink, talk about this and that? How about The Jungle Bar up on Bayshore? Know where it is? Across from the yacht basin? -OK. -Not too long ago, I'm at the track with Mr. DeBoya and a gentleman by the name Jimmy Capotorto. Now, they start talking about their trouble with money, like a couple of broads discussing unruly hair, split ends. Jimmy Capotorto says in Buffalo, he used to have a vault in the floor of his basement, but they got no basements here. DeBoya says, you don't need a vault. There's a lot of places to hide money. It'll be safe. -Now I missed some of the next part because I'm out shagging drinks for the two of them. I come back, and DeBoya's saying, put away what takes you a year to make and keep it close by so you cant take it with you. Now George, how much do you think a guy like DeBoya has put away in ready cash in case he has to slip of into the night and show in Mexico as Mr. Morales? Hmm? MORAN [OFFSCREEN]: I don't know. How much? -Couple if mil, easy. No? -What do you want me to say? JIGGS [OFFSCREEN]: Tell me where he keeps it. -How would I know? JIGGS [OFFSCREEN]: You could find out. Ask his missus. -Why would she tell me? -'Cause she thinks you're cute, George. 'Cause she thinks her husbands a bag of shit. 'Cause she'd like to dump him and play house with you. 'Cause if I knew exactly where it was, I could be in and out of there in two minutes, and your troubles would be over. -Oh, yeah? Why would they? -Because Andres DeBoya would be dead, George, and you and the missus could sail off into the sunset. Now I can get the guys and go in there blazing six guns, and tear the place up. We'll find it, but that's the hard way. And I can't be responsible if an innocent bystander, if you understand what I mean, gets in the way. -Yeah, you must have been really thinking about this a long time, huh? -Walking it around, scratching my head. And you come along, and I think here's a chance to do something for the happy couple. If they'll do a little something for me. What do you think? -This, uh, money DeBoya's got, it's like emergency an fund? JIGGS [OFFSCREEN]: Right. In case he has to bail out in a hurry. -Well, if he's ready to do it, like at a moment's notice, why don't you spook him? Turn in some kind of false alarm. JIGGS [OFFSCREEN]: Yeah? -Yeah. He runs with it, you're waiting for him. Saves tearing his house apart. -That's not bad, George. That's not bad at all. Sounds to me like you're in the wrong business. -The casual Hilton Hotel attire. -Capitano, so good to you see again. -How'd you know I was at the Hilton? NOLAN [OFFSCREEN]: Jiggs. -Mr.Moran, I've come here important because I have bad news to tell you. -Wait up there, Nolan. -Loret Encana, this young lady, has so much to tell you. -I am the sister of Luci Palma. -You are? -Luci's dead. -She is? -I found out the day you left. I found out about Loret-- -Wait up there, Nolan! How did she die? RAFAEL [OFFSCREEN]: Tell him how she died. LORET [OFFSCREEN]: She was killed. MORAN [OFFSCREEN]: I said wait a minute, Nolan! -She was killed, shot to death. -What are you doing, Nolan? -Hey, I hear we're in business. Is that right? -Four years ago, I think. -You're over your head, man. -It was yesterday. -So what else is new? -She was so good to me. -You better stick to drinking. -I live with her. -That's what I'm doing, man, what's the difference? -She sent me to school. -Shut her up for a second, well you? -Now I got nothing! -OK, OK. -I live in a terrible place! -How long has Jiggs been following Mrs. DeBoya? -Tell him how was killed. -Since the guy's sister's been shacking up with the piano player. -Tell him how she was killed. -What a minute! Whoa, whoa, God damn it! Just a minute. You know what he asked me to do? -Yeah. LORET [OFFSCREEN]: They take her! -Come on, yo know what he wants? -He wants-- LORET [OFFSCREEN]: They take her. -He wants you to ask your lady where he hides the cash. -Don't call here my lady. -What's so hard about that? LORET [OFFSCREEN]: They take her from her house! -Shit! Call her on the phone right now! MORAN [OFFSCREEN]: Would you shut up for one second? -I live on the Ozama River! It's terrible place! -OK look, take your hooker and get the hell out of here, will you? -My hooker! -Listen to me, you dumb son of a bitch. --I swear-- -This is a no-win situation. The best you're going to get out of this, if you're lucky-- LORET [OFFSCREEN]: Mr. Moran! -I mean if you get out with your life, it's 15 to 25 at Raiford. RAFAEL [OFFSCREEN]: George, I swear-- -Hard time, you hear me? -I swear to you on my mother's honor! -Keep your mother out of this, pendejo! -You think the wrong thing about me, my friend! -You better wise up, Nolan. RAFAEL [OFFSCREEN]: What do you think I want? -You know this fat fuck is a knee-capper, man. RAFAEL [OFFSCREEN]: What do you think I want? -Not what. How much. -You accuse me? -Yeah, I accuse you. -DeBoya's sittin' on top, George. Look at the guy! He's a fucking walking death squad all by himself! -You make it sound ugly! -And he's married to your lady! [yelling] -I'm not the one fucking DeBoya's wife! -Oh, yeah? What do you mean by that, asshole? Huh? LORET [OFFSCREEN]: Senor! Senor! -Shit! -I can't fuckin'-- I can't fuckin' swim! I can't-- I can't fuckin' swim, George! -There you go. -[gasping] -Just take it easy. Take it easy. -Fuck! -Just take it easy. -Fuck! Fuck a duck, George. -How the fuck did you ever get to be Airborne? -George-- you got a cold one, George? -Yeah. -What's the matter with you? First you come rolling in like a medicine show. Got your little helper with you, fine. Except every guy to her is like a trick. You can see it in her eyes, man. She can't wait to get your fly open. Second, you picked the wrong guy from the standpoint you didn't pick the right one. You follow me, Rafi? -Um-hum. -It's right there in front of you, and you done even see it. You tried to shake down Moran and his girlfriend. What about the girlfriend's husband? He's the guy with the prize, not Moran. Moran's one of the good guys. -The husband. -Yeah. You want to score today, partner, you got to get into the action that's going down. You got to spread a little terror, get people scared, man, like you're part of some wild-ass revolutionary movement. You understand what I'm saying to you? -Get people scared. -Remember the revolution? -Of course I remember the revolution. I could have fought senor, but I was too young. -Yeah, well, Che, your time has finally come. [latin music playing] -Andres-- -Shut up. First I want to show you something. Read this, and then make a decision. -Let me understand this. The, um, the divorce settlement is now an option? -Yes. -And it's up to you whether you want to honor it or not? -Yes. It is up to me. -Andres, before you insisted on a $2 million settlement no matter who ended it. -I've change my mind. -[explosion] [music playing] -Wait here. I'll be back in about an hour. -Mrs. DeBoya? Mrs. DeBoya! Please wait! I'm supposed to be with you! Mrs. DeBoya! -Excuse me, sir. You have to move the-- [music playing] [tires screeching] -You better love me, Moran. -Look at me, I'm dying. -I mean you better be in love with me. -You bet I love you. -The dock blew up. The police have been in and out of the house all morning, questioning me, Andres, the help. Mostly Andres about what political groups would threaten him. -There's a guy named Jiggs Scully works on and off for your husband. You know him? -Yeah, I've heard of him. -He's been following you. He knows what we're doing. He knows Andres got a couple million hidden in the house. He says if we tell him where it is, he'll go in the house, he'll take the money, he'll kill Andres as a favor. -A favor? He must be pretty sure that we'd go along with it. He can always deny it. If something did happen to Andres-- -Mary, we don't need any help. Come on, we don't have to hope that the guy has a heart attack or falls off his boat. All we have to do is walk away. -I know. I'm not hoping for anything like that, but it would make it easy, wouldn't it? NARRATOR: There's always a moment when things change, become something else, for better or worse. what would you do if you noticed it when it happened? Nothing, probably. JIGGS [OFFSCREEN]: I never seen so many dead tough guys on one wall. Huh. I guess you knew 'em all, General. -Um-hum. -I asked around. -What did you find out? -I got a contact in Little Havana, guy named Benigno. He says it's the Democratic Revolutionary Front. -That has nothing to do with me, Jiggs. That's a Salvadoran movement. -Evidently they don't give a shit you're Dominican, Nicaraguan, whatever. You come from the ruling class. You're a bad guy. -Why the dock, thought? -Get your attention. A little terrorist foreplay. Then when you aren't lookin', whammo, they hit you a good one for real. Get their initials in the paper. I wanted to ask you, I, um, I locate any of the party responsible, General, you're going to want to prosecute, I take it? -In my own way. JIGGS [OFFSCREEN]: That's how I'd feel about it myself. You have 'em arrested, they're back on the street in 24 hours. I understand, from what I heard, you were the livin' expert in getting people to tell you things they didn't want to back in the old days. -You want information. When you're questioning someone, the trick is not to ask them any questions. -You don't ask them anything? -Never. Just always take a person's clothes off. you always do that. When they're totally naked, sometimes that's enough. And if it isn't, then, uh, subject the person to-- to an unpleasant experience. Increase it little by little. After a while, he will be pleased to cooperate with you if you stop the unpleasantness. [laughing] -That's where we left her! George! You meet Che? Shake hands with Che Amado, one of your premier fanatics. -I bet you know that! You think I come here to bite you for money. I had you fooled! [laughing] -Yeah, you had me fooled, all right. -Hey! -Which one of you goofballs did the job on the boat dock? -That was Nolan, the powerman! -That's "powderman" in the trade. -Aw, shit. -Hey, nothin' to it. Slip in there in a Donzi, half-speed all the way, me and my shipmate who steered in 12 pounds of plastique. Drift in, boom! The dock's gone. Could have done the whole house! [laughing] -Who did the graffiti? -Did you see his work? Che's ace with the spray paint, right, Che? -No es nada. -We're going to publicize DeBoya's past sins. RAFAEL [OFFSCREEN]: Unless he pay! -Tell George what the man did when he was in charge down there. -What he did? -Tell him what DeBoya did to people. Tell him! -He liked to sew their eyelids to their eyebrows. And women, he liked to cut their nipples off. And men, he cut everything off. Now you call those big, uh, tijeras? -Shears. -Yeah, cheers. Cut all your business off. I had an uncle he-- it happened to. -Well, shears, have another drink. -No, no. I don't feel so good, Nolan. I don't like to think about it. I think I go lie down. I don't feel so good-- -Don't throw up on the floor, Che. You hear? Use the bano! -Nolan. -What? MORAN [OFFSCREEN]: He's using you. -Jesus, I hope so. I need to be used, man. -Come on, Nolan. This isn't your kind of thing. -Is that right? Tell me what I'm saving myself for. -How does Jiggs know she won't tell her husband what's going on? How does he know I want tell him? -Well, shit, there you are. Because I told Jiggs you're my bud. We see eye to eye. I told him your the old Cat Chaser, George. Jiggs got a kick out of that. He sees the humor in life. -Hey, look. Hey, look! You listening to me? -Yeah. -I'm not in it. -What happened? You changed your mind? -I never was in. -Well, Jiggs says you gave him a hell of an idea. -I'm-- shit, man! I'm not in! Listen! Jiggs-- I didn't give Jiggs anything! See, what he's doing, Nolan-- what he's doing, he's using you, and by God, he's going to dump you when he's through with you! He can't afford not to. -Nah. We made a pact, us against them, shirts against the skins, man! -I don't know what I got to do to get something through to you, man. -I'll live. -Yeah, until you die. Jerry'll hum it for you while you're going down the tubes. -Ah, fuck you. -Another week, you'll be down to Thunderbird. -Ah, shit, is tomorrow's the big day. -What happens tomorrow? -We hit DeBoya, that's what happens. George! George, wait, wait! You don't want to go over there. Deboya'll kill you! Just tell me-- tell we one thing, and be honest. Tell me you don't want to see the man dead. [music playing] NARRATOR: That same dream was different now. Mary was in it trying to be Luci Palma, and other people were shooting at him. And when he woke up, one of them was there, and after that it was all a dream. And being awake didn't help one little bit. -If you're not doing anything, I'd like you to come see somebody. DeBoya wants to have a word with you. -You serious? -Put your shoes on. I'll take you, bring you back. -What about? -George, come on. You get there, you can play it any way you like. In the front seat, George. -[speaking spanish] -George! I don't want to go anywhere. Tell them. Tell them, please! -It's OK, George. Get in the car. -Sit back and shut up. [music playing] -So the Italian guy says, keep the dog. [laughter] -What do you call the worst blow job you ever got? Terrific! [laughter] -Hey. -George, all I did was write something. -Hey, daddy-o! What's happening? Some party, George. -OK, Andres, what's going on? -Hey, Jiggs, where's the girls? -Hey! I can't swim! -Hey, he can't swim! -Where you goin', asshole? NOLAN [OFFSCREEN]: I can't swim! [shouts] -He can't sw-- -We're gonna get out of here now. -General! General! General! General, I have information. Look. Santo Domingo. Your wife and the Marine. Look. I can tell you everything about Santo Domingo. [speaking spanish ] I know, General! [gunshot] [music playing] -Let's drag this piece of shit out. -Mary. Get up. -What? -Get out of bed. MARY [OFFSCREEN]: Andres? What are you doing? -Take your clothes off. Come on! Take your clothes off. Lay on the bed. Come on, lay down. So you like to fuck in hotel rooms, huh? He stick it here? Open your mouth. Open your mouth, God damn it! Hold it right here? [mary crying] -Or here? Or here? Here? -Please don't! Don't! [crying] -I haven't finished yet! Get in there, you fucking bitch! Get in here. I don't give a fuck if you read it or not! Sign it! Sign it, God damn it! Now pack your stuff and get that fuck out of here. Get the fuck out! [music playing] NARRATOR: Truth is we're animals, all of us. If you forget that, you're lying to yourself. It took Nolan having his last cold one to get that through to George. A small price to pay for enlightenment. -Oh! [music playing] [knock on window] JERRY [ON PHONE]: Coconut Palms. -Yeah, Jerry, call the cops. JERRY [ON PHONE]: Who they coming for, George? -Well, they're coming for me, God damn it. Oh, God! -George! [knocking] -Wait a minute, George. Well go inside. -No, I got a lot of work today. A lot of work. -Pepe. [speaking spanish] -Mucho trabajo. Much, mucho trabajo. -Nah, you don't work today, man. It's too hot. We go inside, huh? You got, uh, something for Senor DeBoya, no? -Yeah, you think I'm going inside with you, you're out of your fucking mind. Look, asshole, you know there's people watching here. You sabe "witness?" -Oh, yeah? I don't see nobody. Yeah, testigo, comprende? All the ventanas? -Yeah, well, I say we go inside. -Come on! Come on! NARRATOR: Like I said, we're all animals. -Sergeant Roscoe, it's to come to my attention that there's a bomb out at, uh, 700 Arvida Drive. The DeBoya place. And you may not have noticed this, Sherlock, but this is an anonymous call. Just get your ass out there, will you? [yelling] [yelling] [speaking spanish] -Mary. -Boy, am I glad to see you. MORAN [OFFSCREEN]: You ready? -Mary, just-- -Don't touch her, God damn it! I'll snap his fucking neck, I swear to God! You're going to die, you know? You're going to die, and I with to God I could do it right here, right now. You tell him yet, Jiggs? -George, you got a problem? -Yeah, see that slob works for you? You see him? He's going to take you down, Andres. [sirens] -George, you been drinking? -And I don't know why in God's name I'm telling you. -George, please get in the car. -You'll get it, Andres! He'll kill you if he gets the chance! OFFICER [ON MEGAPHONE]: Please evacuate the area. Please evacuate the area. -Sir, you're going to have to evacuate the premises right now. I want everybody out of the house! MARY [OFFSCREEN]: What happened to you, a train wreck? MORAN [OFFSCREEN]: Something like that. What happened to your mouth? -He hit me. -Is it sore? -Not bad. -The way your lower lip sticks out like that, it's kind of sexy. -You want to bite it? -I think I might. You hit him back? -Um-hum. I hit him first. It only made him madder. -First rule in a street fight, never throw a punch unless you can finish it. -What are you, Moran, my trainer or my lover? Come here. -Get the bags. -Hey, this is it, huh? I'll tell you, General, you'll be a lot more comfortable in this place than Boca Raton. Got a sauna and everything. -What you got in there? -I got a .44 mag Browning automatic, 12-gauge pump, some flares, and a 5-gallon can of gas. What else you want? I thought you might need some protection. -Let's go inside. -Help you with the bags, Corky? -That's OK, Jiggs, I can handle it. -I was gonna say, General, I don't think you needed to pack those bags. -You never know, my friend. -Bomb squad'll take the day. You shouldn't be gone more than one night. You can call 'em now. You got a phone. See what they found. -We can do that later. -I wondered, uh, cops say who called 'em? -No, they didn't. They don't know yet. Jiggs, I've been thinking about what that guy Moran said before. That, uh, that you want to take me down. What did he mean with that? -The only thing I can figure out, he was trying to confuse you, General. Get your head turned around so he could run off with your wife. You want me to, I'll go pay him a visit. Where's the can in this joint? I got to take a leak so bad I can taste it. -In the back, to the left. [music playing] [splashing] [splashing] -Something I learned along time ago, General. Never take out your joint with guys you don't trust. Now drop the guns in the toilet. Go on, go on! That's the way. You too, Corko. In the toilet. That's it. Now I want you to take your clothes off. That's what you do, right, General? Strip 'em bare ass. Come on! Now! -How much you want for my life, Jiggs? -I'm gonna make it easy. Only take your suitcases. You're gonna love this, General. State of the art. Factory modified. They call it a Hush-Puppy. Come on, General. Take it off. Take it all off, like the broad says with the shaving cream. You too, Corko. Drop your jockeys. Keep an eye on the General there, he don't try to cop your joint. Shoes, everything. It's got a slide lock here on the side. You fire once, it doesn't eject, so you don't hear the slide kick open. You guys ready? Just leave your clothes where they are, there. See they don't get wrinkled. OK, get in the shower. Come on, move! -Both of us? -Both at the same time. Watch yourself, Corko. Don't drop the soap. OK. Turn the water on. Get it how you like it. -What the fuck, you son of a bitch? -Just turn the water on, will you, please? -Jiggs! [music playing] -The lady. One step ahead of all of us. -My settlement. You love me? What's the matter, cat got your tongue? You're looking at it, but you can't believe it, huh? -Nah, I believe it. How much is in there? -I don't know exactly. But anything over $2 million Andres gets back. I only want what I have coming to me. -You didn't count it? -It's the first time I've ever even seen it. I made the switch when Andres was downstairs. Come on, George, don't be like that. Money make you nervous? -Where'd he hide it? -The bed. -Come on, just lying there? -Inside a marble safe that looks like the pedestal of his bed. -He showed you that? I mean, he trusted you? -Why not? Something to impress the broad, a fortune under the marriage bed. -Astounding. -Then I got worried that he'd get suspicious when I left and go upstairs to check, so I packed two suitcases with some old magazines and shoved them under the bed. -Wait a minute. You planned this? How come you didn't tell me? -I didn't plan it. I just did it. I was mad, my mouth hurt. You see a problem? -Do I see a problem? Oh, baby. I don't think "problem" is the word. -George? If Andres comes, we just won't give it to him, that's all. I'll tell him to see me in court. -And if Jiggs Scully comes, what are you going to tell him? -I'll be God damned if he's going to get my money either. NARRATOR: Mary Delaney DeBoya, one of life's mysteries. They sat out by the pool like they were on a vacation from reality, a not so young couple with money under the mattress and their golden years ahead of them. Mary read a letter from Luci Palma, and she didn't seem to be scared of Jiggs Scully either. -"He is glad you did not kill him. I wish I had seen you, but I tell people I know you here in the war. You did not sit behind barricades. You came to find us, and I'm very glad I did not shoot you. Do you still like the Rolling Stones? Affectionately, Luci Palma de Valera." -Hey, you getting fan mail, George? That's not hard to understand. You got a nice way about you. Mrs. DeBoya, how you doing? -Where's Andres? -The General? Last time I saw him, he was in the shower. George, you got a toilet I could use? That morning coffee goes right through you. -In the house. -Thank you. Appreciate that. Be right back. -No, no, no. I, uh, I have another cup, I might as well stay in the can. I was hoping we could have a talk, just the two of us. You understand? Not get emotional. Why do that, huh? I thought, uh, maybe we could lay it out, come to some kind of understanding what we got here. -Fine. What do you want? -Well, you got a couple of suitcases, and I got a bunch of magazines I'll never read, so I'll trade you. But first, you got to tell me because the suspense is killing me. How much are we talking about? -$2,200,000. -OK. Here's what we do. You keep the $200K for yourself. That's yours, for your trouble. And give me the rest. I mean, that's $200,000 for sitting on your butt watching the ocean roll in. So what do you say? MARY [OFFSCREEN]: And what if we don't give it to you? -The you got a big fucking problem. Let me explain something to you. I put a lot of time into this. I'm relying on that for my retirement. I get in trouble, I can't go to the Social Security. I worked my ass off, put up with all kinds of abuse from your husband. Incidentally, where'd he keep it? The money? -Under his bed. -You're kiddin' me. [laughing] Under the fuckin' bed? Where's it now, under yours? I can not believe it. I should believe anything now. So what do you say, George? -Mary says no. You don't get it. [music playing] -Being realistic, George, what do you say? -It's her money. -I'm gonna show you something. What's that over there in the corner, looks like a vase? -It's a vase. -Ta da! That's my magic act. Hardly a sound. Not even a pop. You're walking along Collins Avenue, all of a sudden you fall down. People right next, they didn't hear a thing. What's this? A good lookin' broad have a heart attack? Understand what I'm saying? It'll happen anywhere, anytime. Or you could give me the suitcases. We can part friends and with each other luck. -You're saying we don't give you the money, you're going to kill the both of us. It's just that simple, right? It may not be right now. -Nah, probably wouldn't now. -But it could happen any time. -You got that way with words, George. -OK. That's all I wanted to know. JERRY [ON PHONE]: Coconut Palms. Jerry speaking. -Jerry, call the cops. -George, am I hearing things? What are you going to tell 'em, some bullshit about I threatened you, I did the General? There isn't anything you can give the cops they can put on me. -I didn't call them for you. NARRATOR: George understood Jiggs better now that he'd killed him. It wasn't really all that difficult, not once you pulled that trigger in your head. He'll never be as good at it as Jiggs was, but he won't be George Moran again, either. MARY [OFFSCREEN]: George? George, you OK? NARRATOR: Sure he's OK. He's just made the dream come true. He's killed somebody he didn't know who was trying to kill him, and he's scared and doesn't know what the hell's going on. But they've got to each other, and $2 million. What's not to be all right? [music playing]
