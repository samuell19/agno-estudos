Come on. Faster, Dad. - Is that him? - Is that really Bernie? - You see that? - Yeah! - Look at that. - Over there! The GPS tracking device shows that he's right here. I've an excellent feeling about this, Kev. Yeah, I know. I've been following the pod's migration for months now. Look, over there! Did you see that? Bernie is back. Yes! - Whaddup, Bernie? - Hey, Bernie! How was your trip home? We missed you so much. Hey bud, looking good! The sunburn healed great. Yeah, it is just a little scar. It gives him even more character. - Kev, got enough video? - Mm-hmm. Dad, get us back fast. We can't be late for our very first day. Oh, well, yes, Ma'am. And uh... welcome back, Bernie! We've missed you. Goodbye, see you soon, all right? See you later. Bye, Bernie! Good morning, everyone! Just a reminder: The vet will be here this afternoon, to give Hemmingway his physical. Second on the agenda, I am excited to announce our newest summer intern and junior dolphin trainer. Let's give a warm welcome to... Holly Ryan. And her videographer-extraordinaire brother, Kevin Ryan. Thank you, Sidney. We are excited to be here at Marineland, officially. I promise to work hard and do the best job ever. We know you both will. Oh! And we have some super-big news for everyone-- Okay, hold that thought, Holly, we have urgent news. I just received word that we are expecting a new addition to Marineland. This won't be easy. It seems there is some past troubles surrounding him. I'll have more information later. But he should be arriving tomorrow morning. Let's get back to work. Next dolphin session starts in 15 minutes, sharp. Hey, you okay, kiddo? Oh, I mean, Miss Junior Dolphin Trainer. Kevin and I just wanted to tell you that Bernie is back. Why didn't you say so? That is huge news. Don't you just love our jobs? Why don't you go tell the team about Bernie? Let's go, Mills. Move it. Well, well, well... Winston Mills. Detective Wyatt. Long time no see. Yeah. About a year and two days to be exact. Yeah. Well... You my welcome wagon? What, no parade? Ah, it's just me and this beautiful sunshiny day. Uh-huh. Looks like you've been busy. Ah, you know how much that I... love dolphins. Pick it up. Yeah, this is what people go to prison for. Littering. Put on your seat belt. Sure, Dad! Hey, guys! Guess what? Bernie is back! I love that smile. Up! Up! Up! Really? Let's go, Winston. You guys are a bunch of comedians. Oh, man! You guys are very funny. Here you go. The halfway house was filled. These are your new digs. Put this on. Left ankle. You go out of range, we will be alerted and you go back into the Big House. That might not be such a bad idea. You see that cockroach? I saw enough of that when I was in prison, okay? Look, Mills, I don't know what strings you pulled to get paroled. But you mess up one time and you are going back in. Yeah, yeah. The judge explained all the rules. Look, I just want to do this work-release program of 30 days. I am free forever. Voil√†! Activated. Okay. So there is food in the fridge and there is clean towels. What is the bike for? You'll see. Tomorrow your parole officer is coming at 9:00 a.m. sharp. Be on time. And, Mills, be nice to him. Check the box. Bernie is there, right, Kev? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tracking due north, Dad. Due north it is. They're up ahead. Dad, slow down, slow down. Hey, guys, what's up? We're here to see you. - See them? - I can see them. Wow, they sure are happy to see you guys. Hey, guys, smile for the camera. Sidney is going to love this. Hey, Dad! Sidney tell you what's going on tomorrow? No, what's happening tomorrow? Something big. He could be real trouble. He? Who is he? That's all she said. Remember, Summer Sands called and wants to do an interview at the cove early tomorrow morning. Awesome! That gives more publicity for Bernie's journey. Hear that, Bernie? You are famous. Hey, bud. Hey, babe, I still have to close up the shop. Kids, we gotta get going back. Bye, Bernie. I'll see you guys soon, okay? - Bye! - Bye-bye! See you tomorrow. Bye! There! Better than those dolphin pictures. This ankle bracelet is killing me. Well, at least the phone is working. Wait a second. Hey, come on! This is a $3,000 suit. Really? What is this? Oh, no! Okay. Not my color and really, really not my style. I sure have missed you, world. Well, well, well! Look who's back home. Hello, Winston Mills. It is nice to have you back. I'm Summer Sands, broadcasting live from St. Augustine beach with two of our local celebrities: Kevin and Holly Ryan. Now, Kevin I hear you have some special news to share with us. Yes, Miss Sands. Just yesterday, Bernie the dolphin and his pod came back home for the summer. So, we've been tracking the pod's migration since last fall. And it's all part of our website, Bernie's Journey. And I bet you are excited that Bernie and his family have come back to our local waters. Yes, Miss Sands, we are really happy that Bernie is back and... I have a news flash too. I am helping at Marineland this summer. So it is going to be a blast. Oh, wow! Here is a shout out to everyone at Marineland and welcome home, Bernie. Yes, we all agree it is great having Bernie and his family back in St. Augustine. Well, do a year in prison, Bernie, and see what it feels like to be back. Hello? Winston Mills. Yeah? It is Mason Jacks, your parole officer. I am outside. Let's roll. Think they will be glad to see me? I wouldn't bet your turtle eggs on it. It is a big day, everyone. As I mentioned yesterday, we have a new addition at Marineland. Did you see that? Nice! Here he comes now, our newest member of Marineland. Okay, okay. Cute! - Hey, buddy! - Hi! - Oh, no! - Such a cutie. It can't be. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. The answer is no. N-O. No way, no how, unacceptable. Mr. Ryan, you should have received a letter from the court weeks ago. My hands are cuffed. No pun intended. Oh! Nice. Sense of humor. Let me tell you something, Officer. I have never received any official notification from the court. So I will thank you kindly to take this dolphin-hating criminal... and get him out of my office. Well, it seems you haven't checked your mail in a while. Oh, really? I'll have you know that I run a tight ship around here. Wanna see? Electric bill... water bill... Three-For-One Pizza. This is a Birthday card for Betty... county court... a sale... Oh. County court. Sorry, Mr. Ryan. I promise he'll be monitored 24/7. And his ankle bracelet lets me know where he is at all times. Look, Bob, I am sorry for what happened. I never meant to hurt you or your kids. I just want a second chance. You know, make up for my past and... help out with these beautiful dolphins. So, where did he come from? He was born in a habitat like Marineland. Seems he has a history of not adapting well socially, like some humans I know. Come here, little buddy. He's quick. What's his name? Um... It isn't listed in our paperwork. I'll make a call and find out. Well, since this a fresh start for him, how about a new name to match? With that feisty attitude, I vote... Rascal! Pretty good observation. Kevin? Rascal, welcome to Marineland! We have to go tell Dad his new name. Come on. I tell you what, Mills, you mess with my kids, Sidney, or any of these dolphins, and you are so going to answer to me. Bob, I am just here to help. Dad, you missed it. Yeah, we have a new dolphin. His name is... Hey, kids. - No, way! - Oh, no! It's him. I think she missed me. Hmm. Thanks. So, how did he get out? Beats me. But I tell you what, I am going to find out. Well, Holly is certainly not happy about it. Yeah, well, that makes two of us. Burgers are ready, kids. I guess I'll take mine well-done. Looks like they are ready, Dad. Come on, let's eat. Mmm! That is not a bad burger. I mean, yeah, it is... crunchy and... chewy. Holly, something on your mind? I don't like the idea of having Winston Mills... around Marineland. Sweetheart, don't you worry. Your dad is head of marketing, and I am going to be there every day to make sure Mr. Mills behaves himself. Well, he better not mess with my dolphins or I'll show him who is boss. Yeah, you-- Hey, listen. We are a family that forgives others not punches them out. Right! Right. So, what about this new dolphin, huh? I hear he is a real rascal. Yeah, yeah. He is cool. He is fast too. Nearly as fast as Bernie. No way! Nobody is faster than Bernie. Kev, what about the new footage? Did you upload it yet? Yes sir. Yeah, it's posted already. Calling it, "Bernie's return." Yeah. Uh, Sidney just texted. She says she wants more footage for the Marineland podcast. You know, tell you what. You know... stop by the shop tomorrow, and we will take the Ryan express 2.0 out on my lunch break. - Sweet. - Um, can I come? What about Marineland, Miss Junior Dolphin Trainer? I thought you had a real Rascal to take care of. Well, we might have two rascals to wrangle tomorrow. But you know what, we can do it. 'Cause we are rough, we are tough, we are the Ryans! That is right. You know what? Would you mind tossing a football with your old man after dinner to make him feel better? - Okay, I'll go grab it. - Nice. Hey, Dad! The junior high football coach talked to me last week. Wait! Wait, wait, wait. You are talking about Coach Watson? He spoke to you? You spoke to him? What happened? He said I am fast and I might be talented and... - I could play receiver like you. - Oh, really? Yeah, yeah and I was just thinking just maybe, you know, I could try out for the team next summer? Well, as you know, your mother and I would never influence your decision but should you choose to, you know, try out for the team, then I think that we should practice every morning before and after school... - How about this? - ...and I have some gear in the garage. Yeah, yeah. Yes. And we will talk about all this later. The reason Kevin is interested in football 'cause he has a crush on a cheerleader. Well, I should've known. Those Ryan men. You go, Bernie. Bernie's back at St. Augustine, everyone. Yeah, look at him. Welcome back home, buddy. Bye! You guys can check out more updates on Bernie's Journey. You guys can follow us on the official Marineland web page. What do you know? Everyone's back. Just like I planned. Oh, my God! Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That was not good. That was stupid. That was... That was... No, that didn't feel very good. Nope. Very excited to be here. He has to be hungry by now. Try a bigger one. Come on, Rascal. It's breakfast! Delicious and nutritious. Good fish! Yummy, yummy, yummy. I can't believe you just did that. Do you have any better ideas? - Yeah, pizza, nachos-- - This is serious, Kevin. Hi, kids, how are you doing? Hey, stop that! What is going on over here? It's him, Dad. Dad, help! He's after us! What did I tell you, Mills? You're here for five minutes, you can't help messing with my kids? No, I didn't do anything. I came, they screamed, then I screamed. I didn't do anything. Hey! Go on, Rascal. It's not funny. It's not funny. - We better keep a close eye on him. - Yeah, why is he really here? Exactly. - What are you two whispering about? - Nothing, Dad. All good. Oh, yeah. As usual, right? Mills? Rascal, lunchtime! Come get it. Hey, Tommy. Any progress? No. Tried everything, but he won't budge. Never met a dolphin that didn't like sushi. All right. Go give Shannon a hand with Hemmingway and I'll see what we can do with him. Good luck. Sure got the name right. He is a rascal. Hey, Holly, let's get to work. It will keep your mind off Winston, helping our buddy here. I love that idea. Shoot, I've gotta go. Mom's taking me to the cove. - Oh, tell the dolphins hey for me. - Will do. - And keep an eye on you-know-who. - Gotcha. I'm on it. Hey there, fishy. Hello. Hey! Hey, hey... Ah-ha! There you go. Your new, best and probably only friend. What's this for? Well, it's for Marineland's new handyman, of course. It's a work-release program, you know. So, chop-chop. And just look at it this way. I'm here to help you clean up your act. Let's get to work. To the toilets. Chop-chop. Let's go. Great. Mom, wait up. Hey, don't leave without me. You'd better get a move on, sailor. Give me a hand, please. - Hey, Mrs. Ryan. - Oh, hey there, Ellie. - Hey, Kevin. - Hey, Ellie. - So, you've been on the water today? - Yes, ma'am. Just got back. Dad's tying down the OSS Shark right now. I saw you on the news. It's good to see that Bernie's back. Yeah, yeah, us too. You and Holly are like famous around here. Everyone's talking about you. Yeah, no. It's nothing really. Just doing my part to help, you know. Oh, that's so sweet. Mrs. Ryan, Harper and I were hoping to rent a wave runner tomorrow. Sure. Just stop by the office. Kevin will have it ready to go for you. Right, Kev? - Kev? - Yeah, just doing what we can. Cool. Okay, see you all later. Earth to Kevin. Hello! Yes, ma'am, I'm glad to help. Guess that's the cheerleader, right? Rascal, meet Sunny. All right, Amber. Let's demonstrate to Rascal how positive reinforcement works. Go and get it. Good job! Nice job, Sunny. Holly, can you give him his reward, please? Good job, Sunny. A-plus. Bravo. Yummy, yummy! You see that, Rascal? That didn't go as planned. Holly? Sidney? This is Winston Mills, as you know. He is our new handyman. Which means it will be his job to clean up absolutely everything in this habitat. Treat everyone with respect, Winston, because I am authorizing the staff, which means you too, to assign work duties to Mr. Mills, should I not be around. - Yes! - Any questions? No. Holly? Do you have anything you'd like to say? Welcome to the team, Winston. Yeah. This way to the toilets, Winston. It was here, Mom. They're heading right towards us. Huh. Do you hear that? Yeah, but what's wrong? Not sure. Let's see. Look who it is. Hey, guys. What's going on? It's good to be back home, huh? Hey, Bernie. What's up, buddy? Say hello to the world. Listen, I better get us back. It sounds like the fuel pump's gone out. Okay, hey, nice job today, Bernie. We'll get some more close-ups next time. Okay. Ah! Finally, it's quitting time. Psst. Get Winston, please. You little monster! What do you think you're doing? Oh! Looks like you missed a spot. Saw that! This is gonna be a great summer after all. How could she possibly have seen that? Nice ride. Is that an eight cylinder? What are doing here? Just an old friend catching up. Get out of here. If anyone sees us together, I'm back in the slammer. Who do you think got you out? Man! Get in. No way. No way. I mean, that's a crazy idea. I'm afraid you have no choice about it. I got you out. I can have you put back in. I just-- I just want to do my time here and be released for good, okay? Well, it's not that simple. When you and Brock Winters messed up that power plant deal... I owe a lot of people money now. And you, you owe me a lot of money. Boy, prison's looking better and better. Right, seriously, how did you get me out? Lucky for you, I still have powerful people that owe me some favors, so... What about Brock? No dice. Too tough to get a former mayor out. He's gonna do his two years for stealing those turtle eggs. Two years? - They stuck this guy with five! - Five-- I lost everything too, you know? Everything! I lost my money, my wife, my mansion. I've been living in that flea-bit hotel for the last six months. And it's all those... It's all those kids' fault. And that dolphin. This is our opportunity to get revenge. No, no. Look, I'm not interested. I'll take my chances. Too late. There's already a deal in place for that... sunburned dolphin. I'll give you a cut. $100,000. All yours. Here. It's unlisted, so they can't track it. Call me when you... wanna upgrade your wardrobe. I like my wardrobe. Figures. I knew I was right all along. See? Caught him red-handed. Yeah, but who's that other guy? I don't know, but I've got a feeling they're up to no good. He does look familiar. I'll cross-reference articles of Winston Mills and Brock Winters. Bam! That's him! - Who's him? - Uh, Devin Cruz, right here. "Financier Devin Cruz was named as the mastermind behind the illegal chemical plants scheme that sent local mayor, Brock Winters, and real estate mogul, Winston Mills, to prison terms." Wow! There are too many bad guys to keep up with these days. Yeah. It looks like the prosecution didn't have enough hard evidence to put Cruz on trial. - We should probably go tell Mom and Dad. - No, not yet. We don't have anything that proves that he's done anything illegal. We'll just, I guess, sit back, keep an eye on Winston. I mean, knowing him, he'll mess up soon anyways, right? - Yeah, he's pretty awesome at that. - Yup. A little banana? Oh, yeah. Which one of you want a banana? Doesn't that look good? Doesn't it look good? Yes, it does. Sike! Okay. I'll give it to you. I'll give it. I won't play any games. I won't play any games. Catch him doing anything illegal yet? No, he has been doing his work, but... he doesn't get along with anyone. Come on, turtles. Let's see how fast you are. Let's see how fast you are. He's like Rascal. He's not cooperating either. Two peas in a pod. All right, keep a watch on him. I'm going to go check on Bernie. - Okay? - Yeah. Stupid turtles. I'm out of here. Hey, guys! Sorry about mean old Winston. He's having a bad day as usual. Want a banana? How are they? Good? They're good? You missed a spot. Don't you kids have better things to do? High five! - Oh! - Can you believe this? Do you know what this one little straw could do to a dolphin? Or a sea turtle? I'm guessing they don't use them for milkshakes, right? Winston, you sure have a lot to learn. Plastics alone harm more than 100 million marine animals each year. Really? Wow! I... I had no idea. Holly, check this out. News flash alert! It's Ellie and Harper. They're missing. Oh, no. What happened? These two teens have been missing since late yesterday. Now, what we do know, is that they left from this beach on a wave runner and their parents have not heard from them since. So, if anyone has seen or has any information on the two teens, please contact the St. Augustine police department immediately. We got to help find them. Find who? Dad, it's Ellie and Harper. They're missing. What do you mean by missing? They rented Mom's wave runner yesterday morning and haven't been back since. It's my GPS tracking alert. Bernie's near Devil's Island. - The pod never goes there. - What? - He's just swimming around in circles. - What if he's in trouble? - We better go check on them. - Yeah. Something's up. Let's go. No, no. Wait a minute, kids. I'm going with you. Winston, finish up here and then check in with Sidney. I'm going to be back. Come on. I am so hungry. Nothing. Not one bar. I could try to swim to shore. You got cut from the swim team. Yeah, so? At least I'm not a pom-pom girl. Oh! Okay, how original. You just had to play the cheerleader card, huh? Yep. It's a no-brainer. And we're out of water too. - Great. - Just keep saying your prayers. I mean, they've got to be looking for us right now. Yeah, and my parents are going to ground me till I'm 80. Uh-oh. Sharks. Just what we needed. They're not sharks. They're dolphins. Oh, my God! Hey, look! That one has a pink spot. That's Kevin and Holly's friend, Bernie the dolphin. - He's kind of cute. - Yeah, they're smart too. Maybe they can help us. Seriously? What are we going to do? Ride them home? Have a little faith, will you? Mrs. Ryan said that Kevin can track them. Bernie, we need a huge favor. Crappy day for you too, huh? What do you want? Are you... Are you hungry? Huh? Well, what do you know. Pretty tasty, huh? Well, I prefer steak over sushi. But to each their own, right? Fishy. Faster, Dad. The pod's about a mile away. You got it, Kev. Got it! Here they come. Come on, camera guy. Bernie needs us. Harper, it's a boat. Harper, it's a boat. Hey, over here! - Hey! - Over here! Kids, over there. We're good. Hey! Ellie! Harper! - There! - I think they're coming our way. They found us. What's up? There's the girls. We found them. Hey! Over here. Yes! Hey! I'm happy to report, Ellie Rogers and Harper Wilks have been found. As you can see the girls are safe and sound. But a bit exhausted after spending a long night on Devil's Island. In an amazing feat, Bob, Holly and Kevin Ryan found the girls with the help of, who else, Bernie the dolphin. Kids, tell us how you did it. Well, Miss Sands, I just used my GPS tracking device to locate Bernie and the pod. And they led us right to Ellie and Harper. Amazing! This unique dolphin and his family just keeps surprising us all. Girls, would you like to say anything? We just want to thank the Ryans. Holly and Kevin were amazing. Oh! And a special thanks to Bernie and his family. Yeah. Go, Bernie! Go, Bernie, indeed. I'm Summer Sands reporting. Back to you, Peter. So that's how they always know where to find that dolphin. The kid's using a tracking device. Bingo. So, how does it feel to be local heroes? Again? Pretty sweet, Mom. That's the second interview this week. That's right. I'm just happy we were able to find them. Well, actually, Bernie found them. But we helped. Well, I'm proud of all of you. Where's Kev? - Prowling around the garage. - I see. So, how's the dolphin training going? Rascal is still being a rascal. Sidney said he's just taking his time to adjust to his new environment. And what about the other rascal? Hmm? How's Winston behaving? He's keeping to himself, doing his job. Good little criminal. Holly, you be nice to him. Trying. Do better than try. Maybe this opportunity will help him turn around. Oh, come on, honey. Let's not go overboard, huh? Hey, Dad, found your gear. - Could we play? - You bet. Football! Now I get it. You really do have a crush on Ellie. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. Yes, you do! Mom, she kissed him on the cheek today. Holly, be nice. She's a very sweet girl. Pretty, too. Mm-hmm. And her boyfriend is this high school back quarter of the school. It's quarterback, sweetie. You want to kiss her back, Kev? Holly Ryan! I just wanna try something new. Come on, ladies. Ladies! Give the boy a break. You know, he just wants to try something new, Ma. And I'm referring to football, of course, and I'm gonna go. Okay, Kevin, it's been some time. This foot goes up, okay? Look, you just, boom! Right? So it's... Set! Hike! Hike! You're not doing this. You're planting, turning, boom! Nice! That's nice! Nice, Kevin. And as soon as you catch, it's right here. As soon as you catch, boom. Hike! - Come on, Kev! - Whoo! Anybody can catch a football, and if you score a touchdown, yeah, you're gonna be on the highlight reel. That's really cool. But the most important thing is earning the respect of your teammates. You know how you do that? Blocking for them. Pick your eyes up a little bit. When you come in, - boom, you're here, okay? - All right. Yeah. And that's how no matter where you go... Go ahead. Right? Right? Ready? Set? Hike! All right, go. Here we go. Here we go. That's nice. - Nice! - Yeah. Here. Here. You're gonna get down right... Hike! Yeah! Yeah! That was very good. - That's the way to do it. - Awesome! - All right. - Yeah! Fumigation? Great. Looks like there's more than one cockroach in this place. What're you doing here? Landlord's an old friend. I used to own this place. People used to respect me back then, you know? They'd call me Mr. Cruz. They'd say, "Hi, Mr. Cruz." "Hello, Mr. Devin Cruz." "Good morning, Mr. Cruz." "Hey, Mr. Devin Cruz. There he goes." Are you okay, Devin? It's Mr. Cruz. Mr. Devin Cruz! Okay, just simmer down. All is fine, Mr. Devin Cruz. That... That Ryan kid's tracking the dolphin. Some sort of GPS device. I want it. You want me to steal from a kid? You've done worse. $100,000 cold, hard cash should clear a bad conscience. I'm just trying to stay clean, stay out of trouble, okay? Besides, there's a new dolphin at Marineland and he even likes me. Oh! Winston's finally found a new friend. That is so sweet. - Yeah. - You owe me, Mills. You mess this up... I'll make sure you wear this for a long... long time. Looks like you need a new nest. I think I can pull some strings. Just get me that device. I'll be in touch. Let's try some nurturing devices. We'll show Rascal how the other dolphins play with them. Okay. Go and get it, guys. Good job. Hey, Holly, try to wave Rascal. - Kevin, will you record this, please? - Sure. - Come on, Rascal. - Go ahead. Come on, Rascal. You can do it. So close. - Oh, brother. - Keep working with him. So, what if he doesn't show any progress here at Marineland? I don't know where else he would go. Don't worry. We'll help him. No matter what it takes. This is so far out of bounds, it's not even funny. The answer is no. But it's a court order, Mr. Ryan. Signed by the judge. You're telling me that you think it's a good idea for Winston to stay here? I mean, this is not exactly a bed and breakfast, Officer. It's just until his apartment is fumigated. There's a bug problem. Huh. And we get stuck with the biggest roach of all. Look, you said he's been on good behavior. If he tries anything funny, I'll be here in a hot minute. Surely, you've some place he can sleep. Shark tank? So I've never been down here before. Well, that's because it's for authorized personnel only. Don't make me regret this, okay? You have a... cot here, and you can shower upstairs in the changing room. - Penthouse suite, huh? - That's right. And look, we've got a lot of nice equipment down here so... just don't mess with anything, okay? What was that? This is your new roommate. My new roommate. Everyone's a comedian. That's gonna be fun. Ouch. Mango, say hi. Say hi. Say hello. Say hello. Who's a pretty boy? Here you go. Aw, who's a pretty boy? Isn't he so cool? Hey, pretty boy. What is going on in here? Oh, this is Mango. He's super, super cool. Hmm, Mango, huh? Mango. Pretty boy. And there is a reason why there's a parrot in my office? Yeah, he's Tommy the trainer's pet bird. And Tommy's moving apartments, so... Can we keep him here? Can we? Can we? Please? Yeah, it's just gonna be for a couple of days. Is there a volunteer to feed and clean up after Mango? I will! I volunteer. I love Mango! I love Mango. Well, looks like we have two new residents, kids. Mr. Mills here is staying down in the maintenance room while his apartment is being fumigated. - What? No way, Dad. No. - Yeah. He's a bad guy. Bad guy. There's nothing we can do about it. It's a court order. Okay. That's enough. Come on, let's get back to work. Winston, grab your cleaning supplies and meet the kids out by the shark tank, will you? Okay. Sure. I'll... I'll be right there. Winston. Bad guy. Bad guy. Wow! That's so cool. Yeah, well, that's... suicide, if you ask me. Those things give me the creeps. What is that? Bernie's journey. You wouldn't like it. It's dolphin stuff. Hey, I know you kids don't like me, but I'm really trying here. All right. This is how it works. There's a signal that tracks Bernie and the pods' locations at all times. So, how do you do it? How do you track them? Well, by the GPS that was in Bernie when Marineland released him. Huh. Sounds pretty high-tech. How does it work? It's just nav. I unlock the code and... track the signal. That's it? All you need is a code? It's pretty simple if you know what you're doing. Six, four, eight, five... Oh, that's... That's my parole officer. You know, I'll call him later. So, I'm guessing a lot of people must have the code then? No way. It's top secret. Just me. Well, and my dad, in case of an emergency but... Hey, Winston, you working or on break again? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm working. I'm working. You can tell me more later. Okay... I guess. - Hi. - Hi. - Can I help you? - Yes, ma'am. I'd like to rent a boat. Okay, well, let's see. Now, we're pretty booked. It is the summer season. Let's see. Yeah. Sorry. Nothing until next week. Ah... Nothing at all? Friend and I were really hoping to do some fishing. Well, you know, I might be able to have the Dungone fixed in a couple of days. Yeah, I mean, she's a little rough around the edges but... She'll get your job done. Ah... How about this Thursday? That sounds absolutely perfect, ma'am. Thank you. And I'm happy to put down a cash deposit. Tell me, does the Dungone have a tank? - A tank? - Yeah. Hoping to catch a real whopper. Yes, sir. She'll hold any fish you catch in these waters. - I just need a name. - Frankie. Frankie Franklin will do. You should hear my middle name. It's a good conversation starter at parties, though, right? - Sure, it is. - Thursday. - Thursday. - See you then. That's right, sir. Tomorrow? Oh, yes. We are go for launch on that. Did you get us a big one? The old Dungone. Nice lady inside says it'll hold anything we catch. You're joking. The Ryans own this place? That's perfect. That's perfect. Hey. Bob? Pretty boy. You button it up, bird. Bad guy. Bad? I'll show you bad. Ah! Don't call me at work, okay? It's not good. Relax. Relax, Mills, all right? So, how do you like your sleeping quarters? I told you I'd pull some strings. Did you get the device? It's not a device. It's an app. But we got a major problem. The kid's the only one with the code. Look, Mills, I don't care what you have to do. Get me the information by tomorrow. Come on, wait a minute... Hello. Hello... - That's great. That's just great! - Great. Just great. Clean the toilet. I don't take orders from you, pal. Besides, I don't do bird poop. Bird poop. We got them. Here they come. - Yeah! - Yeah! What's up, Bernie? Whoo-hoo! - Nice! Yes! You're a genius, you know that? - Really. Wish I could've gone to see Bernie with Kevin and Dad. I know, honey. You know, Holly, I'm really proud of you for sticking with your commitment at Marineland. Right? That shows a lot of character. Thanks. I'm learning a lot about the animals. If I could only fix Rascal. Yeah, well, you know, maybe he'll come around and surprise you, okay? Speaking of... any surprises from our buddy Winston? He's acting okay, I guess. But I still don't trust him, though. Look, remember, Holly, we're supposed to forgive others, all right? - How about giving him a second chance? - Yes, ma'am. - I'm trying really hard. - That's my girl. Ah-ha! - I think I found our culprit. - What is it? See this cable wire? If this gets unplugged, the motor will stall and we'll get in big trouble. I guess Frankie Franklin will want the Dungone to purr like a kitten, huh? Sure looks like that master's degree is paying off. I'm so proud of you. Thank you, sweetie. We're a lot alike, you know? I've got problems. You've got problems. We both moved around a lot. No place to call home. Yeah. They just don't understand us, do they? There you go. That was awesome. Hey, look! What's going on here? Uh... Hey, kids. You know, I'm just getting an early start today. You know, I've got lots to do. You know, so... A fish just kind of fell in the pool, there. That fish didn't fall in. You fed it to him. He wants you to pet him, too? Didn't see this coming. Strange days indeed. Hey, I have an idea. - Kev, your camera ready? - Uh, yep. Okay, so when I give him the hand signal, toss him the fish. Okay. - So... Fish now? - Okay, now. - Good boy. - Thanks. I was referring to Rascal, not you. Oh. Yeah. I mean, of course. Yes. There you have it, Marineland fans. You just experienced a miracle. Be sure to check out more about Rascal and Bernie on our webpage Bernie's Return. Peace out. We did that. That was pretty cool. He trusts you. Now, stay away from Devin Cruz and maybe we'll start trusting you too. Time to feed Rocky and Pokey. You can help if you want, I guess. Um... Sure. How'd they know about Devin? Hey, boys. Come up. This is Rocky. A loggerhead sea turtle. He was hit by a boat propeller so he's a bit beat up. Wow! I mean, he's a monster. Yeah. Strong as an ox and weighs 250 pounds. Whoa. That makes him a heavyweight, right? "Yo, Adrian..." You haven't seen Rocky, have you? Uh-uh. What's a Rocky? Oh, is it that old cartoon with the moose? No. No. No moose. Rocky, the movie. He had turtles too. This here is Cuff and this one here is Link and it's like... Never mind. Okay. Come on. Come over here. I want you to meet someone. Check it out. This is Pokey. He's been in human care for 34 years. Yeah, he saved another turtle's life when his blood was used for a transfusion. Oh, and watch this. Pretty awesome, huh? It's his favorite thing ever. He's doing the hokey pokey. So, you still don't like dolphins and sea turtles? How can you not like a turtle named Rocky, and a turtle that does the hokey pokey? Hold on. Ah, it's Mason. I better check in, or I'll be back in the pokey. Hey, officer, yeah. Look, I'm sorry I'm late checking in. There's this giant turtle and it's doing the hokey... I... Never mind. Well, Bob Ryan really said that? Yeah, fine. I'll check in tomorrow. Thanks. Come in. Oh, hey, Bob. Hey. Listen, the kids were telling me that... You were really a big help out there with Rascal today. Oh. Why... It was... - It really wasn't anything. - No. No. I just... All I'm here to tell you is that you're really doing, you know, a pretty good job. Well, thanks. Thanks. I guess, it's... needed learning curve for me too. Okay. Yeah. Well... Speaking of jobs... Keep up the good work. So remember, when you're running about, you want to plant your foot, snap your head around as soon as you can and look for that ball. Got it. Yeah, Kev, look for the ball, and maybe, just maybe, Ellie will look at you. Hey... How do you think I got my dear sweet Abby? - Is this true, Mom? - Well, what can I say? I'm a sucker for a man in uniform. Lucky for me. Eww! Gross! Clean the toilet! I don't want to hear from the cheap seats, okay? What do you want now? Time's up, Mills. I need that code. It all goes down tonight. What do you mean tonight? I can't get the code that fast. Besides, I can't leave Marineland. If this ankle bracelet goes off, I'm busted, pronto. Okay. I'll arrange a pick-up then. Just listen up good. Yeah. Yeah. The Marina. The Dungone. Yeah, Bernie the dolphin. Yeah. I get it. I know. All right. Not a word from you. Don't look at me like that. Bad guy. Hey, kids. Hey, you want a slice? I'm not really that hungry, so... Extra cheese. Yeah, I... I think I'm up to my eyeballs with peanut butter and jelly, so... You know, Winston, Rascal's really getting along with the other dolphins. You really helped him, you know? I think that you kids do all the work. You know, I'm just some ex-con, ankle-bracelet-wearing bad guy. - Even your bird said so. - No, you're not. You're actually pretty nice, Winston. Mom was right. Sometimes we have to forgive others. And give them a second chance. Hey, guys. I've got a meeting. We're closing up early today. - Can you two help feed the tribe? - Sure. We can eat on the run. - Last one's for you. - Oh, thank you. What a cutie you are, Mango. Mango. What a cutie! Hey, Dad's at the boat shop. Everybody's leaving. We're locking up. - Have you seen my phone? - Nope. When did you have it last? I haven't seen it since we fed the dolphins. - Did you ask Winston? - Haven't seen him since lunch. Winston. Bad guy. No, Mango. Winston's now a good guy. Marina. Tonight. Bernie the dolphin. Get the code. What, Mango? Repeat. Marina. Tonight. Bernie the dolphin. Get the code. Marina? Tonight? What code? Bernie the dolphin. Bernie the dolphin? Mango, what are you talking about? The code. My phone. Winston! Devin Cruz. It's about time. About ready to shove off, I see. Yes, ma'am. Just waiting for my friend. That's a pretty big net you've got there. Yeah, you are planning on catching a big one. Well, we're certainly hoping to, ma'am. Okay, well, if you're all set, I'm gonna go lock up the shop. I got to take the Ryan Express 2.0 for a test run. Ah! That her over there? Yes, sir. Yeah, she's been acting up lately, but... she's like family. Well, uh, happy fishing. - Hope you catch a whopper. - Me too. Good luck with your boat. Not you too. All right? I really don't need the guilt trip. Yeah. It's me and I got it. Yeah. I'll meet you up at the parking lot. You're where? - All right. Let's go. - Well, maybe we should call Dad. - With what? He's got my phone. - Oh, yeah. Right. I forgot. All right. Look, we can do this. All right? We have to save Bernie. You're right. He is a cutie. What are you doing in here? Relax, Mills, the place is closed. And I'm in a hurry. You have the code? Yes. Yes. There. Everything is right there. Look, I held up my end. I'm out. You'll get your cut of the money as soon as we get the cargo delivered. Just keep it. You know, I don't want your dirty money. Suit yourself. More for me. If you change your mind, I'll be down the street at the Florida Inn, room 105. Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. Well, I got a fish to catch. Bye, guy. Maybe I'll be back for you tomorrow. Hey, hey, hey. You stay away from that dolphin. In fact, stay away from all of them. Good job, Rascal! Now, get out of here. I never want to see your face again. This is it. Devin's motel. Are you sure this is a smart idea? Yeah, we have to figure out his plan. Come on. Okay, get down. Get down. Here, come on. All right. Here's the plan. Housekeeping. Housekeeping. Excuse me. - Come here for a second? - Oh. I just need to show you something, okay? Yeah, sure. - Did you find anything? - Are you crazy? You nearly gave me a heart attack. Keep looking. We got to hurry. Where's the cleaning lady? Looking for a giant mouse in room 14. Nice. - So what are we looking for exactly? - Evidence. Frankie Franklin? Frankie Franklin? He's renting a boat from Mom. Seven-seven-nine. Yes, got it. Wow. He's a horrible bad guy. Hokey and Pokey could hack this computer. I'll check his search history. - A marine park? - In South America? Here's an e-mail to a veterinarian. "How to ship a dolphin"? OMG! The Dungone. - The Marina! - Bernie. Let's go. Dude! Well... That doesn't sound good. Let me check it out. Or was this just a clever scheme of yours to get your husband all alone, out at sea in a romantic boat? I mean, yeah. I needed you for backup. Oh. Well, good. At least I'm good for something. Think it's the fuel pump again? Impossible. We're out of gas. We're running late. I took the liberty of making sure the Ryans aren't gonna be coming back any time soon. Well done, Frankie. Sure you know how to catch a dolphin? I got the biggest net I could find. I got the tracker. Why don't you go and get the boat started. I'll be there in a minute. Hi. Yes, sir. Yeah. We'll be there in one hour. And we'll have that dolphin. - Where are we going? - You'll see. - Hurry. We got to be fast. - Just keep it quiet, okay? Help. Help. Push it off. Yes. Come on. Where is it? Ah-ha! Got it. I got Mom's skills. - Let's get out of here. - Not yet, all right? Got to get my phone back. They can still find Bernie. Quick. Get down. Get down. Hello. Who is this? Uh... Wrong number. - Well, that was strange. - What? Some man just answered Kevin's phone. Yeah, you can say that again. I really messed up, pal. I'm sorry. You know, I really, really am. Hey, Bob. No. No. No. I haven't seen the kids. Bob, listen. I... I really need to tell you something. I messed up big time. A man? No. I got this. Okay? No, you let me handle it, Bob. Hello? You hang in there, Rascal. And if I never get to see you again... You're one heck of a dolphin. That was Winston. What did he say? Well, he said that he'll handle it. Handle what? Where are the kids? I don't know. He doesn't know. I wasn't able to tell him that we're out here stranded in the middle of the ocean. Hey, look, it's our dolphins. - It's Bernie. - Hey, Bernie. You're gonna think I'm nuts. - What are you doing? - Bernie, he found those girls, right? I mean... We need a helping hand here, bud. You know what this is? Here goes nothing. Bernie, take this to our kids. What the... He's making a run for it. Come on! - Hey, mister. - Yeah. - Come on. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. - Go. Go. Go. Uh-oh. Where are you going? I am getting so tired... of you two. On the boat! Get on the boat! No, no, no. You stay with me. - Over there, buddy. Get down in there. - Kevin! No. No. No. No. - Hold it right there, Mills. - It's not what it looks like, okay? I can explain everything. You just couldn't stay clean, could you, Mills? These kids are in trouble. We got to get to the boat! What? It's Devin Cruz, all right? He's got the Ryan kids. We're wasting time. Let her go, Cruz! Oh, you! I should have known it was you. Double-crossing weasel! Let the girl go now! Oh, no. No. No. No. The girl or the fish. Bernie's not a fish. He's a mammal. Okay, yeah. Kev, remember what Dad taught you? What do you say, officer? Even trade? Down. Set. Hike. - Are you okay? - Yeah. We're fine. Thank you. Winston... Bernie's pod is right there at the dock. Come on. We got to go. Go. - Now, you be careful. - Yeah. Oh, Mills. Mills. Mills. Oh, boy, you just... Well, you've really outdone yourself this time, huh? You are going to pay. You're gonna go down with me. Yeah, you know? I'm pretty darn proud of it too. Officer, you got another pair of those? Hey, guys. Look, Bernie's got something. It's Dad's driver's license. License? Guys, where's Mom and Dad? What are we gonna do? We need major help. - You okay, honey? - Yeah. Just a little worried. You think the kids are okay? Yes. I do think the kids are okay. Look, come on. I'm usually the scaredy-cat, you're the strong one. Right? Have a little faith. That's right, Robert A. Ryan. We keep the faith. Until... I do hope someone comes soon because it is a long swim home. You hear that? Oh, is that the dolphins? - Bernie! - Yeah! Here comes the cavalry! Mom, Dad! Over here. - We finally found you! - Hey, guys. What's up? Coast Guard has arrived. Guys, we actually found them. Thanks to Bernie. Good job, buddy! What up, Bernie! Whoo-hoo! Thank you, Bernie! Thank you! Thank you, Bernie! We love you. We did it! Ah! What a day! - We're so proud of you two. - Mom, were you scared? No, we knew you'd show up. Bob? Hey, Officer Mason. - Winston. - Bob. Devin Cruz is in custody. He was the mastermind behind this whole charade. I do have a decision to make. Technically, there's a parole violation to address. Ah! Yeah. Kids told us. Well, Abby, what do you think? Kids? What about you? Let's do it. Well, Rascal seems to think you're okay, so... Take them off, Officer. I appreciate you having faith in me. Thank you. It's what us Ryans do. Thank you. Yeah. Bernie. Great job, little buddy. Bernie, thank you. You're the best dolphin in the whole world. - Thank you, Bernie! - Thank you, Bernie. - Bye, Bernie! - Bye! - Bye. See you tomorrow! - Bye, Bernie! - Bye, Bernie! - Bye! - Bye! - Bye, Bernie! A-camera mark. Are you ready? - Okay. Okay. - She can do it. - No way! - Oh, no. It's him. I think she missed me. I see Devin's snuggle bunny. So what're we looking for exactly? Damn it! I don't need to... Oh, no! Ready? We're gonna walk back in. Yeah. - And that's a wrap... - On Bernie the Dolphin 2.
