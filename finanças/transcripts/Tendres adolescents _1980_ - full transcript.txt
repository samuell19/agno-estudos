TENDER FRIENDS Go on, Paulot, catch! Go on, throw it! Stop, you're tickling me! - Alright, let's go back! - Ok. You want it? Yes, thanks! Go on, take it! Have you seen the state of us? We're covered in straw. We'll have to wash. To the water! If you start doing that I'll never get clean! Och! It's freezing! Are you sure we need to wash in there? See? You're dressed and you're soaking. Subtitles: JDC Studio Adaptation: James Coats
