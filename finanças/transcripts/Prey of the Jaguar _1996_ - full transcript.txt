HALLOWEEN IS MORE THAN A MONTH AWAY. YOU KEEP WEARING THIS OUTFIT TO BED, YOU'RE GONNA RUIN IT. SORRY. OH, IT'S NO BIGGIE. I JUST DON'T THINK MOM'S GONNA HAVE TIME TO MAKE YOU ANOTHER ONE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. I PROMISE. GOOD. THAT'S THE BEST PANTHER MAN COSTUME IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S JAGUAR, DAD. OH. I CAN'T KEEP THESE GUYS STRAIGHT. HE'S ONE OF THE X-MEN, RIGHT? NO. I MADE HIM UP. YOU DID? WELL, HOLD ON. LET'S CHECK HIM OUT. TURN AROUND. OH! WHOA! THAT'S WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE, HUH? HE'S GOT GLOVES SO BAD GUYS CAN'T TRACE HIS FINGERPRINTS, AND HE'S GOT DARTS AND OTHER STUFF. SEE? THEY GO IN HERE. WHAT KIND OF DARTS? REGULAR KIND, I GUESS. HE PUTS SLEEP STUFF ON. HE'LL USE THEM INSTEAD OF BULLETS. LOOK. THESE ARE GREAT DRAWINGS. WOW. OH! TERRIFIC. I'M GONNA BE JUST LIKE HIM. WELL, THAT'S COOL. PROMISE ME YOU WON'T GO FLYING OFF THE ROOF OR ANYTHING. JAGUAR CAN'T FLY. HE CAN'T? NO, THAT'S WHAT SO COOL ABOUT HIM. HE'S JUST A NORMAL GUY WHO MADE HIS MIND AND BODY REALLY STRONG SO HE CAN WAGE A WAR AGAINST THE EVIL ARMIES OF THE UNDERWORLD. OH, YES? SO WHO WOULD WIN ONE ON ONE? MICHAEL JORDAN OR JAGUAR? MICHAEL'D CREAM HIM. ( laughs ) AND WHAT ABOUT JAG-- OH!-- AGAINST DAD? NO CHANCE. TEN SECONDS LEFT IN THE GAME! JAGUAR DOWN BY ONE. WHOA!

Mom: BETTER NOT BE JUMPING ON THE FURNITURE UP THERE! UH-OH! LISTEN, WE BOTH BETTER GET DRESSED, OR YOUR MOM'S GONNA SEND UP THE CAVALRY. KID'S GETTING GOOD, KAREN. ANOTHER FEW MONTHS. MEANS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO RETIRE. NO, JUST TAKE A BREAK UNTIL THE NEXT LITTLE SHOOTER IS READY. I HAVE A FEELING THIS LITTLE SHOOTER'S GONNA BE A GIRL. OH. MAYBE SHE'LL LET ME WIN. MAYBE. ( chuckles ) OH, HONEY, YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE. OH, THAT'S OKAY. CURT AND GINO CAN GET A JUMP ON THINGS. BESIDES, WE'RE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE ALREADY. ( doorbell rings ) WHO'S THAT? I HAVE NO IDEA. COME IN. JASON. BEEN TOO LONG. COME IN. NICE HOME. YOU'VE BEEN DOING WELL FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. YEAH, WE'RE DOING OKAY. YOU REMEMBER MY WIFE KAREN? OF COURSE. ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU. PLEASURE. PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT. BIT OF A SURPRISE. REALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE, THOUGH. NOW, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. WELL, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE WELCOME IN MY HOUSE. I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT. I REALLY AM. BUT AFTER YOU HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, YOU MAY WANT TO KILL THE MESSENGER. WHAT'S THE NEWS? BANDERA IS OUT. OH, JESUS. WHEN? EARLIER THIS MORNING. HE WAS BEING TRANSFERRED FROM ONE FACILITY TO ANOTHER. HE OBVIOUSLY HAD ACCOMPLICES WAITING FOR HIM. INSIDE JOB? HAD TO BE. IS THERE ANY CHANCE HE COULD TRACK ME DOWN? NO REASON HE SHOULD WANT TO DO THAT. YOU'RE DEAD, AFTER ALL. OUR ORGANIZATION MAY HAVE SOME PROBLEMS, BUT... WE DID MANAGE TO DO A PRETTY THOROUGH JOB OF THAT. DEATH IS YOUR SPECIALTY, ISN'T IT? ( laughs ) YOU'RE QUITE A WOMAN. SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW, JUST PACK UP EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE BUILT HERE AND JUST START ALL OVER AGAIN? I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE NECESSARY. OH, REALLY? YOU CAME STRAIGHT TO US THE MINUTE YOU FOUND OUT. IF THERE'S NO DANGER, WHY HAVE YOU COME? BECAUSE YOU DESERVE TO HEAR THE TRUTH. I FEEL THAT I OWE YOU AT LEAST THAT MUCH. AND I WAS HOPING I COULD CONVINCE YOU TO HELP US GET BANDERA FOR GOOD THIS TIME. I HAVE A FAMILY. THEY'RE MY PRIORITY NOW. HMM. THERE ARE OTHER PRIORITIES, JASON. THE GLOBAL ARENA'S CHANGING EVERY DAY. THE ORGANIZATION NEEDS YOU, AND I NEED YOU. YOU SAVED MY LIFE ON MY VERY FIRST ASSIGNMENT, AND THEN AGAIN WHEN YOU ALLOWED ME TO WALK AWAY EIGHT YEARS AGO, BACK TO A NORMAL LIFE. I'LL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO COME BACK FOR GOOD. JUST UNTIL WE GET BANDERA. THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE ORGANIZATION ANYMORE. TO ME IT'S LIKE A... LIKE AN ATTACK DOG. IT'S GROWN TOO OLD, STARTED BITING ITS MASTER. SHOULD BE PUT TO SLEEP. NO DISRESPECT MEANT, SIR. WELL... I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK. I ALWAYS HAVE, AND I ALWAYS WILL. YEAH, I KNOW YOU DO. IF YOU DECIDE TO MOVE ON, DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY. WE DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF, SIR. I ALWAYS DO. SO. DO WE MOVE? NO. GOD, NO! LISTEN, AGENT JASON SHEPHERD IS DEAD. BANDERA HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING OTHERWISE. BESIDES, THIS IS OUR HOME. WE'RE SAFE HERE, ALL RIGHT? ( siren wailing ) GOT A SEC? YEAH, SURE. I, UM, JUST TALKED TO THE CAPTAIN. I'M NOT HAPPY. YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT. WHAT'S THE MATTER? ( sighs ) THIS IS TOUGH. WHAT'S TOUGH? I'M TRANSFERRING TO RAMPART. NO WAY. THAT'S CRAZY. THE CAPTAIN'S ALREADY APPROVED MY REQUEST. LOOK, I'VE LEARNED A LOT WORKING WITH YOU, ROG. I'M GOING TO MISS YOU. GOOD-BYE. HEY, WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND. YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THE HOLLENBECK DIVISON THAN THE REST OF THESE GOOMBAHS PUT TOGETHER. DON'T TRY TO CHANGE MY MIND. WILL YOU AT LEAST TELL ME WHY, FOR CHRIST'S SAKES? IT'S YOU. ME? WHAT DID I DO? EVERYTHING, ROG. EVERYTHING YOU DO ATTRACTS ME MORE AND MORE. I JUST CAN'T FIGHT IT ANYMORE. I LOVE YOU. AND IT'S DANGEROUS FOR BOTH OF US. WAIT A MINUTE. I LOVE YOU, TOO, YOU KNOW, IN MY OWN WAY. I REALLY DO. ( laughs ) GOTCHA! HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, PARTNER. FIVE YEARS, 142 BUSTS, AND 68 PRACTICAL JOKES. BITCH. YOU BET. OH, YEAH, WE GOTTA ROLL. DOUBLE HOMICIDE IN A WAREHOUSE DOWN ON ROMAINE.

JUST A WARM-UP, MY FRIEND. LET'S GO. ( lift whirring ) HEY, DID YOU HEAR THAT? WHAT? HEY, CURT, YOU OKAY? NO, I'M AFRAID CURT IS NOT OKAY. ( Tanaka laughs ) AND NEITHER IS HIS LITTLE FRIEND. I THINK YOU'VE BEEN WORKING THEM TOO HARD. THEY BOTH LOOKED DEAD TIRED TO ME. WHO ARE YOU BOZOS? GINO, STAY WELL OUT OF THIS. YOU LOOK GOOD, JASON. A FRIEND OF YOURS? YOU BET YOUR ASS WE'RE FRIENDS. GOOD, BECAUSE ANY FRIEND OF HIS IS A FRIEND WHO DIES. TANAKA? NO! AAH! THE HEART, TANAKA. ALWAYS AIM FOR THE HEART. IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK. BANDERA, YOU BASTARD. NO, I SAY YOU ARE THE BASTARD. YOU PRETENDED TO BE MY FRIEND. YOU CAME TO MY HOUSE, THEN YOU BETRAYED MY FAMILY. I DID MY JOB. I DID MY JOB, BUT AT LEAST I'M NO KILLER. MY FATHER'S HEART EXPLODED BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID. IT WAS JUST LIKE YOU STUCK THAT KNIFE IN YOURSELF. HAZARDS OF THE DRUG TRADE, ALL RIGHT? I WAS ORDERED TO TAKE YOU DOWN. THAT'S WHAT I DID. EVERY DAY I SAT IN THAT STINKING CELL, I THOUGHT OF YOU. EVERY PIECE OF FOOD I ATE, I WAS CHEWING YOUR GUTS. EVERY ROCK I CRUSHED WAS YOUR SKULL. SO NOW YOU'RE DREAM'S COME TRUE, HUH? NO. NOT QUITE. YOU SEE, FOR EIGHT YEARS, I'VE LIVED FOR THIS MOMENT WHEN I CAN LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND TELL YOU THAT I, TOO, CAN DESTROY A FAMILY. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? YEAH. AND I DID THEM WITH MY OWN BARE HANDS. GOD. YOUR WIFE WAS QUITE DELICIOUS, ALTHOUGH AFTER EIGHT YEARS IN PRISON, SHE DID TAKE QUITE A BIT OUT OF ME. ( chuckles ) AND THAT CUTE LITTLE BOY, THE LAST LOOK ON HIS FACE... GOD FORGIVE ME. IT'S A GOOD DAY TO DIE. ( gunshot ) AAH! THE RULE, TANAKA, IS BUSINESS BEFORE PLEASURE. TODAY WAS, OF COURSE, AN EXCEPTION. NOW, LET'S GET SOME WORK DONE. I'VE GOT EIGHT YEARS OF LOST INCOME TO MAKE UP FOR. ( engine starts ) ( radio buzzes ) ALL RIGHT, FELLAS, COME ON. TAG HIM. BAG HIM. DONE. ROG, LET'S GO. I JUST GOT A CALL THAT MIGHT GIVE US A BIT MORE TO GO ON. YEAH, WELL, IT WON'T BE TERRIBLY HARD, 'CAUSE WE GOT SHIT HERE. WELL, BANDERA'S CAR WAS JUST SPOTTED IN MAR VISTA.

( chirps ) WHOA, HOLD IT RIGHT THERE. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING, SPORT? RELAX. THEY KNOW ME HERE. IT'S ALL RIGHT. LET HIM IN. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST, BENTLEY. HOW'D YOU GET IN THIS FAR? OH, IT WAS A BIG CHALLENGE. WELL, YOUR ACCESS WAS TERMINATED A LONG TIME AGO. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FOUND A GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM, BUT THAT ENDS NOW. PUT THAT SHIT AWAY. SO... WE GET A VISIT FROM THE LEGENDARY JASON. I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. I AM. NOW LET ME TALK TO THE COMMANDER. I CAN'T. WHAT? LISTEN, BENTLEY, I'M IN NO MOOD, OKAY? HE'S DEAD. HUH? CAR ACCIDENT.

THIS ORGANIZATION STILL OWES ME PLENTY. I WANT BANDERAS'S LOCATION, SATELLITE, PHOTOS, TELEPHONE LINKUPS, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS. DAMIEN BANDERAS, HEIR TO THE BANDERAS DRUG CARTEL? YEAH. HIS FATHER VICTOR BUILT UP THE BUSINESS, RAN IT FOR YEARS. WE COULD NEVER TOUCH HIM. ALL TRAILS LED TO A DEAD END. OR A DEAD INFORMANT. WE GOT ZERO COOPERATION. THOSE BANDERASES OWNED EVERYBODY. SO WE DID THE ONLY THING WE COULD DO. WE TOOK DOWN THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT. YEAH. BUT THEN WE HAD TO GET PERSONAL. WE MESSED WITH HIS FAMILY. WE HAD THE NERVE TO PUT AWAY HIS ONLY SON, HEIR TO THE THRONE. YEAH, AND I HAD TO SET HIM UP. DAMIEN DIDN'T TAKE IT THAT WELL. ICING ON THE CAKE IS HIS OLD MAN HAD A HEART ATTACK. END OF STORY. ( chuckles ) WRONG! JUNIOR'S OUT. THE COMMANDER CAME TO SEE ME THIS MORNING. WAIT A SECOND, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU SAW THE COMMANDER? YEAH. HE TOLD ME SOMETHING ABOUT A JAIL BREAK. NOW, LOOK, WE BOTH SAW THE DANGER SIGNS, BUT WE IGNORED THEM. WELL, IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE BANDERAS IS BACK IN. I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. RANDALL, HE'S BUTCHERED MY FAMILY. JESUS. I DIDN'T KNOW, JASON. SO TELL ME WHAT YOU DO KNOW. AS FAR AS THE ORGANIZATION IS CONCERNED, BANDERAS IS HISTORY. NOW, IF THE COMMANDER KNEW ANYTHING DIFFERENT, HE NEVER TOLD ME. CRAP! LOOK, JUST BECAUSE I RUN THINGS NOW DOESN'T MEAN I KNOW EVERYTHING. THE COMMANDER WAS GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS. YOU KNOW THAT, JASON! HELL, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE ALIVE UNTIL YOU WALKED IN THIS ROOM. SAVE IT FOR THE PAYING CUSTOMERS, WILL YA? JASON, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF. FIRST YOU QUIT WITHOUT REASON, YOU DISAPPEAR FOR AGES WITHOUT WORD, AND THEN YOU WALTZ IN HERE AND YOU ASK US TO HELP YOU? I AM NOT LEAVING HERE WITHOUT BANDERAS'S FILE. ALL RIGHT. YOU PEG HIM WITH THIS, JASON? I TOLD YOU, JASON'S DEAD. SO IS BANDERA. HEY, I WANT TRUTH, NOT FICTION. WELL, LIKE IT OR NOT, THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT. NOW, SINCE THIS BUILDING'S RESTRICTED TO GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL ONLY, I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE. AND IF YOU DON'T, I'LL HAVE TO ASK AGENT HUDSON TO TRY OUT HIS MAC-10. HE'S BEEN DYING TO TRY IT OFF RANGE. WHY ARE YOU PROTECTING THIS CRUEL BANDERAS? BANDERAS IS DEAD. YOU'RE RIGHT. I'LL SEE TO IT. AND THAT GOES FOR ANYBODY ELSE WHO STEPS IN MY WAY, ANYBODY. JASON, IS THAT A THREAT? WHICH WORD DIDN'T YOU UNDERSTAND? EHH. GO AHEAD, GET HIM THE HELL OUT OF HERE. YOU HEARD HIM, SPORT, NOW MOVE.

IS HE STILL WORKING FOR THE S.O.C.? OH, NO, THEY KICKED HIM OUT FIVE YEARS AGO. THEY FELT HE WAS NO LONGER IN TOUCH WITH TODAY'S RECRUITS. HIS WAY OF TEACHING WAS TOO... OH, HOW DID THEY PUT IT? TOO SPIRITUAL. IS HE STILL AT THE SAME DOJO? OH, SURE. HE'LL NEVER LEAVE THERE. BUT LISTEN, JASON, IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT TALKING TO MASTER YEE, DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH. YOU KNOW, HE'S GETTING OLDER AND... JUST DON'T EXPECT THE SAME MAN WHO TRAINED US. HEY, WITH HIM, I'M ALWAYS PREPARED FOR THE UNEXPECTED. ( laughs ) ( dog barking ) ( grunting ) YOU HAVE GROWN SLOW. TECHNIQUE SLOPPY. YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TRAINING. NO, MASTER. NO DISCIPLINE. ALWAYS PROBLEM. ALWAYS LEAVING. THIS TIME I'LL STAY. WHY THIS TIME DIFFERENT? BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN TO THIS TIME. AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE, YOUR BOY? THEY'RE GONE. DEAD. I'M SORRY. HOW? MURDERED BY BANDERA. SON OF A BITCH KILLED MY FAMILY. MY LITTLE FAMILY! I WILL HELP YOU. I WANT TO LEARN A NEW TECHNIQUE. YOU NEVER FINISHED LEARNING OLD TECHNIQUE. OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. MAKE IT SIX MIL, AND I'LL KICK IN ANOTHER KILO. YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT. WELL, I WILL TEACH YOU, BUT BEFORE YOU CAN MASTER YOURSELF PHYSICALLY, YOU MUST LEARN TO CONTROL THIS RAGE THAT YOU CARRY. ABSOLUTELY. ON MY FATHER'S HONOR. THERE IS MUCH ANGER AND PAIN INSIDE YOU. VERY POWERFUL IF YOU KNOW HOW TO CONTROL IT... DEADLY IF YOU DO NOT. YOU MUST COME TO TERMS WITH THE DEMONS IN YOUR MIND. CONFRONT THEM, ACCEPT THEM, AND USE THEM TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. DEAL. THE WAREHOUSE ON ROMAINE. YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS? MM-MM, 9:00. CIAO. I'M IN YOUR HANDS. A SENSORY DEPRIVATION TANK WILL LEAVE YOU WITHOUT THE SENSE OF TOUCH, SMELL, TASTE, HEARING, OR SIGHT. ALL THAT REMAINS IS TRUE INNER SELF. YOU MUST GET TO KNOW IT. I FELT OUR LITTLE ONE FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST NIGHT. GOD, I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. IT'S A GOOD DAY... IT'S A GOOD DAY... IT'S A GOOD DAY TO DIE. THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. I AM... I AM... LIKE YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST. LIKE YOU'VE SEEN A GHOST. KAREN! KAREN! KAREN... I HAVE A FAMILY. THEY'RE MY PRIORITY. IT'S JAGUAR. THE ORGANIZATION NEEDS YOU, AND I NEED YOU. COME BACK, JASON. HELP US NAIL BANDERA. ( panting ) YOU ARE READY TO LEARN THE WAY OF THE JAGUAR! ( martial art yells ) THE WAY OF THE JAGUAR IS ONE OF STRENGTH... STEALTH... AND SPEED! Jeremy: JAGUAR'S JUST A NORMAL GUY WHO MAKES HIS MIND AND BODY REALLY STRONG. BUT IT TAKES MORE THAN EXERCISE. WHAT REALLY MAKES HIM SPECIAL IS HIS TRAINING. HE DOES IT BECAUSE HE REALLY WANTS TO STOP THE BAD GUYS, BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOTTA MAKE THEM PAY FOR THEIR CRIMES. HE'S LIKE A GHOST. NOBODY CAN TRACK HIM. HE'S QUICKER THAN LIGHTNING AND JUST AS POWERFUL. BALANCE IS SECOND NATURE TO THE JAGUAR. IF YOU SPARE ENERGY IN A FIGHT, YOU CANNOT WIN. AND EVEN IF THEY COULD, THEY'D HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE GREATEST FIGHTER YOU CAN IMAGINE-- KARATE, KUNG FU-- HE KNOWS THEM ALL. YOU'LL LIKE JAGUAR, DAD. HE'S A REAL GOOD GUY. YEAH, THE GUY IN THE JAGUAR SUIT WILL BE A TOTAL HERO TO KIDS EVERYWHERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? ( laughs ) DON'T YOU HAVE AKATA TO DO? WHERE IS YOUR TRICK OR TREAT BAG? THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED THIS. HOW DID YOU-- OH, NOT IMPORTANT. WHAT IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU REMEMBER YOU TRAINING. DON'T THINK YOU'RE SOMEONE ELSE JUST BECAUSE YOU WEAR SOME COSTUME. I BELIEVE IN YOU, BUT YOU MUST BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. ( door chirps ) ( chirps ) ( zaps ) UHH! WHO IN THE HELL ARE YOU? ALL RIGHT. YOU WANNA BE NEXT?

THIS ONLY COVERS THE LAST... EIGHT YEARS. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. A FRIEND OF MINE UP ON THE HILL, HE RAN IT FOR ME. THAT'S ALL HE COULD FIND. I GOT ON THE PHONE, CALLED THE DMV. THEY GOT NOTHING ON HIM, NADA. SO, BEFORE 1988, DEREK LEIGH DIDN'T EXIST. GUY'S A GHOST. I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE ALL MORNING, AND GUESS WHAT, IT GETS BETTER. I CALL HIS HOME PHONE NUMBER. DISCONNECTED. MAYBE WE SHOULD PAY HIM A LITTLE VISIT. ALREADY SENT A UNIT BY. THIS GUY IS LONG GONE. NO FORWARDING ADDRESS. WELL, IT'S NOT A CRIME TO MOVE, ROGER.

THIS OLD ORIENTAL GUY ANSWERS. "OH, NO. OH, NO. NO, I CAN'T TALK. GOTTA GO." ( indistinct ) MR. LEIGH'S NEW HOME. INTERESTING THEORY. WORTH CHECKING OUT, I SUPPOSE. I FOUND THIS ON MY DESK THIS MORNING. WITNESS RELOCATION PROGRAM? MM-HMM. SEE, I GOT THIS LITTLE THEORY, HERE. SEE THIS GUY, JASON SHEPHERD? MM. WHAT HE DID WAS HE RATS OUT SOME BIG, GIANT DRUG KINGPIN, TURNS STATE'S EVIDENCE. THEY SET HIM UP WITH NEW IDENTITIES. DEREK LEIGH. EIGHT YEARS GO BY, THESE GUYS TRACKED HIS ASS DOWN AND THEY MURDER HIS FAMILY. AND THEN THEY GO AFTER HIM. FITS. SO HE'S PISSED, AND RIGHTLY SO. DECIDES TO TAKE MATTERS INTO HIS OWN LITTLE HANDS. THEY'RE VERY CAPABLE HANDS. YOU THINK THIS IS OUR JAGUAR? HERE'S WHAT I THINK. I THINK WE SHOULD GO DOWN AND PAY THIS LITTLE HOP SING FELLOW A VISIT, SEE IF HE'S GOT A ROOMIE. I GOT THE KEYS. HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE? ( laughs ) TIME'S UP, LITTLE MAN. AAH! ( screaming ) FREEZE! AGENT HUDSON! MASTER YEE. WHO ARE THESE MEN? THEY'RE WITH ME. NO! MASTER! MASTER... COME ON.

THEY'D ALREADY KILLED HIM. WHAT DID YOU DO? BEFORE I COULD DO ANYTHING, THIS THIRD GUY IN A NINJA SUIT BUSTS IN, YELLS, "LEAVE HIM ALONE!" AND SHOOTS THEM WITH THOSE DARTS. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? HE JUMPED OUT OF THE GODDAMN WINDOW. THE WINDOW? SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME, I CAN TELL YOU. THAT'S WHEN YOU ALL SHOWED UP. LOOK, I CAN IMAGINE WHAT YOU MUST'VE THOUGHT. OH... THAT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT A GOOD IMAGINATION. HELLO! HEY, HOW ABOUT LOOSENING THESE THINGS UP? THEY'RE KILLING MY HANDS. YEAH, SURE. ( chuckles ) NO. LOOK, WHERE AM I GONNA GO? I LEFT THE CAR KEYS FOR YOU, DIDN'T I? ROGER, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. ALL RIGHT, MY DEAR. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. I FOUND IT ON ONE OF THE, UH, UNCONSCIOUS MEN. U.S. GOVERNMENT, HUH? YEAH, YOU RECOGNIZE THE BRANCH? BOY, I SURE DON'T. MR. LEIGH, I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DETAIN YOU. IS LEIGH STILL COOLING IN THE TANK? OH, YEAH, HE'S IN THERE ENTERTAINING THE HOOKERS AND PIMPS WITH HIS STORYTELLING AT LEAST FOR ANOTHER... ELEVEN HOURS YET. AFRAID NOT. WHAT IS THIS? THIS IS BULLSHIT. HE'S GOT A FRIEND SOMEWHERE. I'M NOT GONNA SPRING THIS SON OF A BITCH. HE'S A GODDAMN VIGILANTE. WELL, HE'S A DAMN GOOD ONE. OH, I AM JUST GETTING SO SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING-- YOU REALLY THINK THAT THIS RENEGADE SHIT IS OKAY? LOOK, HE TAKES OUT THE GARBAGE AND LEAVES IT FOR US TO COLLECT. IT'S THE EASIEST BUST OUR GUYS HAVE MADE IN A LONG TIME. YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT, NOW, IS IT? OKAY, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. IT'S BEEN A WEEK SINCE JAGUAR SURFACED. THE DRUG TRADE IS DOWN 40%. WE SHOULD BE THANKING HIM, NOT TRYING TO TAKE HIM OUT. YEAH, BUT PEOPLE ARE DEAD. YEAH? WELL, FOR ONCE, IT'S THE RIGHT PEOPLE! LOOK, IF HE WAS WASTING CITIZENS I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU, BUT THESE ASSHOLES ARE DYING BY THEIR OWN HANDS. HE'S GOT THEM WASTING EACH OTHER! YEAH, WELL, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING-- HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE BEFORE SOME DUMBASS INNOCENT BYSTANDER GETS CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE WITH A BULLET IN HIS BRAIN? THIS GUY'S GOTTA BE STOPPED. IT'S NOT GONNA BE TODAY. LEIGH. LEIGH! I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S WRONG. PLEASE STOP. WHY DON'T YOU LET US DO IT? AND YOU DO IT SO WELL. MM-HMM. APPARENTLY FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T HOLD YOU. I CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING YET, BUT YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A MISTAKE. SO I'VE GOT SOME ADVICE FOR YOU, OKAY? WHILE YOU STILL CAN, WHY DON'T YOU JUST WALK AWAY? THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. AS FAR AS I KNOW, YOU HAVEN'T KILLED ANYBODY YET, BUT YOU WILL. AND WHEN YOU DO, GOD HELP YOU. MR. LEIGH. YOU, UH, YOU FORGOT THESE. GUESS I'M A LITTLE SCATTERED. WELL, IF I'D BEEN THROUGH WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH RECENTLY, I'D PROBABLY FORGET MY OWN NAME. YOU'LL BE OKAY? UM... LISTEN. IF I WAS THIS JAGUAR CHARACTER, I'D FORGET MESSING AROUND WITH THE PUNKS, AND I'D GO STRAIGHT TO THE MAIN MAN. I-I'D DO IT SOON, AND THEN I'D VANISH FOR A WHILE. THANK YOU. CHILL, CAT. IN THE ALLEY. COME ON. YOU'VE GOT GREAT TIMING. YEAH, GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEED RIGHT NOW. YEAH? WELL, IT'LL BE A COLD DAY IN HELL BEFORE MR. BANDERA ALLOWS YOU TO MESS UP OUR BUSINESS. ARGH! GAME OVER! YOU TELL BANDERA HELL'S ABOUT TO FREEZE OVER. COMMANDER? NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, JASON. I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. I WAS MEANT TO BE. BANDERA. NO. BENTLEY. WHAT? LITTLE SNOT-NOSED PRICK TRIED TO KILL ME. HE DIDN'T DO IT HIMSELF; DIDN'T HAVE THE BALLS TO DO THAT, BUT... HE DID PLACE THE ORDER. WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? BENTLEY AND BANDERA ARE IN THIS TOGETHER. YOU SEE, JASON, IT'S ALL A MATTER OF BUDGET. SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY FOR THIS OPERATION. IT'S EXPENSIVE. IT TAKES A LOT OF CASH. THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T DO IT-- TOO EASY TO TRACE. BUT WHAT IF SOMEONE HAD AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF UNTRACEABLE MONEY? DRUG MONEY. THE BANDERA CARTEL, A BILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS. ONCE THE OLD MAN DIED, THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT TO RUN IT... BUT CONVENIENTLY, WE HAD JUNIOR IN OUR PRISON. QUICK DEAL, A FEW SIMPLE CONCESSIONS, NEXT THING YOU KNOW UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT. A FEW SIMPLE CONCESSIONS? YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT, BUT YOU WERE PART OF THE DEAL. BANDERA WANTED YOUR HEAD ALMOST AS MUCH AS HE WANTED HIS OWN FREEDOM. I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT, EITHER. THE DAY THAT I CAME TO WARN YOU ABOUT BANDERA, I HAD NO IDEA THAT BENTLEY TIPPED YOUR LOCATION. AND THEN THE WHOLE THING BEGAN TO SNOWBALL. AFTER THE MURDERS, I ALMOST WENT BALLISTIC. I MEAN, CHRIST! WE'VE BECOME EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE FIGHTING AGAINST. WORSE! SO, I THREATENED TO EXPOSE THE WHOLE THING, AND THAT'S WHEN BENTLEY DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO ELIMINATE ME. BUT I WAS LUCKY. ONE OF MY LOYAL PEOPLE TIPPED ME OFF. I BEAT HIM TO THE PUNCH, FAKED MY OWN DEATH. SO IT WAS YOU THAT SPRUNG ME FROM JAIL BEFORE BENTLEY'S GUYS COULD GET AT ME? I STILL HAVE A FEW CONNECTIONS. AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS YOU THAT REPROGRAMMED THE ORGANIZATION SECURITY SYSTEM SO MY OLD CARD WOULD WORK. IT WAS EASY. WELL, NOW WHAT? NOW YOU FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED. CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE TO FIND HIM? YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW? I STOLE BANDERAS' FILE, BUT... A FEW OF THE PERTINENT DETAILS WERE OBLITERATED. IS THAT THE REASON YOU WERE FUTZING AROUND WITH THE LITTLE GUYS INSTEAD OF HITTING THE MAIN MAN? HE DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT. NO, NO, NO. BENTLEY'S GOT HIM STASHED AT OUR COMPOUND. THE LAST PLACE I'D HAVE THOUGHT TO LOOK. WITNESS RELOCATION PLAN. ( owl hoots ) OW! ( rips ) THAT'S IT! NOW I'M GONNA START SHOOTING, YOU SON OF A BITCH! OW! AAH! I'D LOVE TO CONTINUE OUR CAT-AND-MOUSE GAME, SONNY, BUT I GOT MORE MICE TO BAIT. OH! GOOD THING I CHANGED THE FORMULA. FOR MY NEXT TRICK... ( beeping ) AAH! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? SONNY, STATUS REPORT. ( static ) CORDOBA! ROSEN! HALDEGUNG! ANDERSON! BUTLER! WILLIAMS! WHERE ARE YOU GUYS? HOLY SHIT! ( shouting ) KEEP COMING! I'M GOING AROUND THE BACK! ALL RIGHT, THERE HE IS. AAH! ( screaming ) IT'S LEIGH. YOU STINKING JUDAS. YOU LED HIM TO ME, DIDN'T YOU? YOU DOUBLE-CROSSING SNAKE! TOUCH ME AGAIN, AND YOU'RE GONNA WIND UP WITH YOUR OLD MAN REAL QUICK. I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM. DON'T YOU COME BACK TILL HE'S DEAD. ( hisses ) KITTY! COME HERE, KITTY. ( beckons ) COME AND GET IT. AAAH! ( screaming ) TANAKA'S DEAD. THIS IS YOUR BATTLE, BANDERA. I'M GONE. HOW DO YOU PLAN ON GETTING OUT, BENTLEY? WELL, THIS IS A GOVERNMENT AGENTS SPECIAL OPERATION CENTER. USE YOUR IMAGINATION. ( thunder rumbling ) HELLO, DEAD MAN. LET'S GO. COME ON, BABY. ( grunting ) ( panting ) DON'T. ( laughs ) YOU USE A DART GUN. EVEN IF IT TAKES TWO SECONDS TO TAME YOUR VICTIM... ( coughs ) ...I CAN STILL BLOW YOU AWAY. THIS ISN'T MY GUN. I TOOK IT OFF ONE OF YOUR MEN. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. UHH! SUPERHEROES DON'T LIE, BANDERA. THANK YOU. YOU JUST DID ME A BIG FAVOR. HE WAS GETTING TO BE A BIT OF A NUISANCE. YOU KNOW, IT'S ALMOST GONNA BE A SHAME KILLING YOU. ALMOST. EH-EH! KEVLAR VEST ISN'T GONNA SAVE YOU THIS TIME. ( gunshot ) I WAS... IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. HEARD SOME GUNSHOTS. THOUGHT MAYBE SOMEBODY NEEDED MY HELP. WELL, I SEE I DIDN'T GET HERE IN ENOUGH TIME TO KEEP THESE TWO FROM KILLING EACH OTHER. YOU ALL RIGHT? ALIVE, I GUESS. WELL, I GUESS I'D BETTER CALL IT IN... AND START MAKING SOME ARRESTS. ( dial tones ) THIS IS DETECTIVE CODY JOHNSON. THANKS, CODY. I SEEM TO HAVE STUMBLED ON A BIT OF A SITUATION. Son of a bitch. ( scoffs ) OH... Son of a bitch. Here's to you, son of a bitch. ( laughs )
