We are kings! We are the kings of African music, the kings! Because music is the king of all professions! MUSIC IS THE WEAPON BLACK PRESIDENT FELA ANIKULAPO KUTI In 1985, tomorrow, next month... I will be president of this country... I will be president of this country, I know it! Once again the history of the elections Obasanjo planned them very well Once again the history of the elections Obasanjo planned them very well He took the old politicians Who ran Nigeria before The same old politicians Who have already ruined Nigeria Obasanjo takes them all All of them are now It's not over, it's not over.... Young Africans have two ears and two eyes They see the things that happen and listen too Few are fat with a lot of money And the rest go hungry I, Fela, challenge Obasanjo The cheats he always does Take me to court and I'll show him the laws We have a government made of bastards Help me sing! The government is elected by gun Help me tell this! We have a government of friends of friends Help me to report! Money! Broken! Arrangement! Trickery! Broken! Arrangement! Money! Trickery! Add it all up! give me the answer! Who is Fela? Some say he is the greatest musician in Africa Others say he is a prophet Others still say he's a rebel A revolutionary tribune! His name was Fela Ransome-Kuti the name of a slave Since 1977 calls himself Fela Anikulapo Kuti The name of a king! To support your candidacy in the 1983 presidential election he created his own party: the MOP The Movement of the People! Youth are not interested in elections I think that changes if the MOP participates The government should register the MOP soon Because if they don't this time there could be trouble But knowing this government, they will not register me They have no intention of registering me They are trying to create a two-party government where you cannot register other parties Want them to be like a law Prohibiting the existence of more than two parties in the country People's minds have gone low There is no food, no water, no light... no government people are edgy There is no solid situation The roots are lost... Every day our senators come and go from the US And nothing happens in my country... And the newspapers exclaim: "Armed robbers, Thieves!" The public think they have to take care of themselves So any suspect is lynched, killed... This is wrong! It's not African at all! Africans don't behave like that This is the kind of criminal behavior, criminal environment that the government installed in the country People are not in a stable mindset But I see a future... I see a future in my political party Pan-Africanism is on everyone's mind now Subconsciously everyone knows they have to be African now Fela was born in 1938 in Nigeria His father was a Protestant minister and school principal. A strict and strict man in the British style His mother was "the great lady" of Nigerian independence A militant attracted to the communist cause She even got to know Mao Tse Tung The Ransome-Kuti were not inhibited by the English settlers. They were also indifferent to the preservation of ancient African traditions They gave a typical western education to young Fela In the early 60's Fela went to study in London His love then was music not politics In his generation, the African consciousness would undergo a singular deviation Influenced by the North American Black Movement The entire black world shared Martin Luther King's dream A few months later, President Kennedy would be assassinated. "I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal I have a dream That one day on the red hills of Georgia The sons of former slaves And sons of former slave-owners Will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood I have a dream" In 1969, Fela travels to the USA Where would I stay for 10 months The Black Power movement was at its height After the Disappointment with the Civil Rights Movement The Watts Uprising and the assassination of Martin Luther King In Los Angeles Fela reads the autobiography of Malcolm X over and over again he wants to become a hero a black hero He writes his first protest songs Across the ocean, 3800 miles from home Fela discovers Africa When Fela returns to Nigeria The Biafra war is raging, it will go on for two and a half years. leaving a million dead among the ruins As far as wars are concerned, this one is especially absurd. The division of Africa between colonialist powers ignored ethnic boundaries And the rebels of Biafra try to secede but are mercilessly subjugated by federal forces "Not me mate" Fela's mistrust of new African governments especially that of Nigeria is born from this war It is a mistrust that will soon grown into to open war There are many dangerous people in Africa The Nigerian President is Dangerous Shagari is dangerous as a person he is weak... but what surrounds him, his administration is dangerous He himself is not dynamic enough to be dangerous but the structure around it is dangerous they say he is a great man but underneath, He's ruining the whole continent So he is dangerous He has nothing to offer, makes no meaningful statements in Nigeria there is a committee on apartheid They held a meeting on Apartheid in Namibia Nigeria is involved in everything But this country is against another country (BIAFRA)! How can Nigeria be talking about South Africa? South Africa is better than Nigeria I know so! Look, we're saying white people are mistreating black people in South Africa Okay, that's bad, that's racism, but that's their logic Now black people are mistreating black people in Nigeria! What logic? That's worse! The police beat people in the streets like they were dogs! in South Africa they do this, but they know they face public criticism So take care when doing But in Nigeria... They say that Nigeria is against apartheid In the USA they talk about Nigeria as if it were the biggest African country But Nigeria is the worst African country! Where the worst things are happening! Lagos, capital of Nigeria The country is the white elephant of Africa One hundred million inhabitants, meaning that one in four Africans Is a Nigerian It's the sixth largest oil producer in the world but these billions of dollars must first pass through the pockets of a handful of chiefs and ex-generals You can get a hi-fi set and cellophane-wrapped bread anywhere in Lagos And you can also drive through miles and miles of suburbs That have no water, electricity nor sewers Huge secret arms trade has been going on since the Biafra war The number of armed robberies became so high that the government Decided to hold public executions Thieves were executed monthly, on Sundays, on the most popular beach in Lagos. everybody run run run everybody scatters some people lost some bread Someone nearly dies Someone just died The police are coming, the army is coming! confusion everywhere several minutes later Everything has calmed down, brother The police are going The army is going Leave sorrow, tears and blood [chorus] Them regular trademark Leave sorrow, tears and blood [chorus] Them regular trademark We fear to fight for freedom We fear to fight for liberty We fear to fight for justice We fear to fight for happiness We always get a reason to fear We don't want to die, we don't want to get hurt We don't want to be extinct I have a son my mother is at home My kids are home I'm going to build a house I built my house we don't want to be extinct I want to enjoy life I don't want to go Then a cop will slap you in the face You won't say anything The Rhodesia n�o evening is not ai The words of our leaders are worthless In South Africa, they take care of their affairs Leave sorrow, tears and blood [chorus] Them regular trademark! Them regular trademark [chorus] Them regular trademark! Them regular trademark [chorus] Them regular trademark! Them regular trademark [chorus] Them regular trademark! That's why... everyone run everyone scatters someone lost money a person almost died The police are coming The army is coming confused all over the time comes Time waits for no one The police are coming, The army is coming! Com confus�o With style KEEP LAGOS CLEAN! This famous Victoria Beach Where so many thieves were executed Since the return to civilian government three years ago Executions have stopped But the waves keep throwing bodies on the sand Lagos, the most dangerous city in the world... In broad daylight, a gang of thugs may appear out of nowhere Holding a stick full of nails, or a broken bottle And burst your tires, rip open your suitcase or gouge out your eyes It's 10 pm in Ikeja, a suburb 18 miles from downtown Close to the international airport This is one of the most dangerous places in town Every night, around midnight, Fela arrives at THE SHRINE ("The Sanctuary") In his little bus, with his singers and dancers The Shrine is Fela's nightclub But it is also a real shrine, as you will soon realize The musicians have been playing for hours, the audience is already wound up People come from all over the country There are workers as well as students Cops, thieves, the unemployed... And even unknown government ministers And no one can say whether they came to listen to the prophet's inflammatory speeches Or to rock to his special Afro-Beat! Everywhere you go, everywhere you are Everyone wants to make a show of power! [chorus] Power show When you arrive at the border an immigration officer will get you Will waste your time He's going to change his pants Some comb their hair Then they set the table So they pull out the chairs Before realizing your presence If you don't speak quickly he goes out to shit When does he come back And you talk to him You are then surprised when he scolds you And says you won't cross You will not cross today This is the time when they start Your Power show at seven in the morning, the day breaks and the music stops Barely looking tired, Fela and his women leave the Shrine "Move that helicopter man!" They arrive in Kalakuta The big communal house where they live a few blocks away For the last ten years, Fela has never left this working-class neighborhood Even when he had money or power Here he is loved and respected, like a new African chief The Republic of Kalakuta A part of Fela, his lieutenants and his women Next door, the smaller houses of the bodyguards, helpers, and everyone else One hundred people live here permanently This is Fela's republic, or rather his kingdom... When he travels abroad, he charters an entire Boeing to transport Close friends, his orchestra and his 15 wives It is very important for a man to marry many women Men naturally go after many women. In Europe, a married man goes out to have sex when his wife goes to bed. He should bring the women to live in his house, not go out on the street! That's what a man should do! A man should not go out on the street chasing women In 1977, Fela married his 27 dancers and singers at once. According to the Yoruba ritual Now they are called The Queens ("The Queens") In the African tradition, you learn not to feel jealous You Africans, listen to me as Africans And you non-Africans, listen to me with an open mind Suffer, suffer in this world - AMEN! Enjoy in heaven - AMEN! Cristos dizem - AMN! 'In the spirit of hevinus' - AMN! Muslims proclaim - AMEN! 'Alahu akubar' - AMEN! Suffer, suffer in this world - AMEN! Enjoy in heaven - AMEN! Cristos dizem - AMEN! 'In the spirit of hevinus' - AMN! Muslims proclaim - AMEN! 'Alahu akubar' - AMEN! Open your eyes, all around The Archbishop lives in abundance The Pope is enjoying life The Iman is having fun too The Archbishop is enjoying himself! The Pope himself is enjoying The Iman himself is enjoying it! Christianity and Islam are just artificial religions We know why Christianity and Islam spread across Africa It was to exploit the people All Christians think like white Europeans, English and Americans All Muslims Think Like Arabs They are turning African minds away from their roots and nothing more Africans need to know this! They need to know what is original Someone has to spread that knowledge And I think I have this knowledge This is a world of higher forces People have to realize this This is done alone, in your home, with knowledge of your culture and past Of your family and your people Being a Christian or a Muslim has nothing to do with When Fela began to preach a return to traditional religion It was in search of a deeper African identity It was a cultural provocation, an intellectual move But in the spring of 1981, the spirits really visited Fela's house! Since that revelation, a dialogue with the other world has taken place every day. At the Shrine, around 2 am, in the middle of the show Fela suddenly asks for silence and performs a rite on behalf of the main Yoruba spirits. Yoruba spirits: Shango, Ogun and Ifa They are the same great spirits found in America In Voodoo and in Afro-Cuban and Brazilian cults On the altar are also portraits of Malcolm X, of Nkrumah - The hero of African independence And also that of Fela's own mother That since her death has became the 'Spirit of rain' BLACKNESS: A Force of the Mind Music is something spiritual, you can't play with music! If you play with music you will die young When the higher forces give us the gift of music, it must be used! for the sake of humanity If you use it for your own gain or to deceive people You'll die young man I've told people that many times I will prove them wrong and that I am right because I am now 44 years old. And I'm getting younger 'cause I'm doing the right thing I can play for 10 hours straight I never get tired, I'm getting younger! The spiritual life of the music I got right is helping me now Whether you like it or not After you hear these true words Whether you like it or not After you hear these true words If you like it will be good If you don't like it you go to the gallows If you like it will be good If you don't like it you go to the gallows If you go to the gallows you will die I will die for nothing They will take your body to the police station You die wrong In the African community there are special women They are called YALAGI It means "women who have special power to see" To see the future, to see ahead and behind These are the special women important people always have them around at home I have my yalagi in my house, they advise me what to do At this point, some of Fela's wives left only 15 stayed These women show remarkable courage Because life is not easy in the Republic of Kalakuta Fela may be one of the biggest musical stars in all of Africa But he continues to survive in an entrenched field A real rebel zone And the powerful don't like it On Friday, February 18, 1977 at noon A thousand armed soldiers surrounded Kalakuta ready to fire The siege lasted 15 hours There were mortar fire A generator exploded, the house caught fire... The rebels are forced to surrender Fela and his mother are thrown from a window Soldiers behave with animals They rape women after committing all kinds of abuse against them Beat everyone with clubs Fela and his tribe go to prison They stayed behind bars for a month until they were expelled from Nigeria Take refuge in Accra, capital of Ghana There is no one in all African politics Who deserves to be followed besides two people Nkrumah and my mother! That's what I'm talking about! All that bullshit you hear around This government threw my mother out the window! Mrs. Funmilayo Anikulapo-Kuti, who gave blood for this country in the streets So they do it burned many houses They burned my house too they killed my mother So I took the coffin I walk, I walk, I walk We went to Obalende We went to the Dodan barracks We arrived at the gate We put the coffin on the floor Obasanjo was there We put the coffin on the floor They don't want to take it [chorus] But they end up taking it Who will want to take the coffin? [chorus] But they end up taking They have to take it! [chorus] But they end up taking For the bad, bad, bad things But hostility between Fela and Nigerian authorities never ceases In the autumn of 1981, after his third European tour An intense press campaign is launched against him This time, Fela is accused of committing an armed robbery. A crime punishable by the death penalty In December 1981, the army attacks Kalakuta again The film crew was present on the day There was no time to film, just to take pictures In the blink of an eye The army surrounds the house Soldiers run inside - men capable of anything Tear gas pumps make breathing impossible, site must be evacuated The soldiers enter with all They loot the house, their clubs don't spare either pregnant women or children Fela is severely beaten, his "Queens" are whipped with chains The whole tribe is dragged away Once again, Fela finds himself in prison The police arrived with 5 cars, vans and large trucks They started surrounding the house, beat everyone, threw tear gas They made us leave, they beat us! They beat up Fela! They stole all our money! Took our goods, our things! We don't know what happened! What was the crime Fela committed?! Why did they arrive, beat up and do this?! They jumped out of the trucks, did this and left... What did we do?! they beat me! They threw my personal belongings on the bus! What did I do?! I'm 7 months pregnant! What did I do to these people?! I didn't do anything wrong! They gave me butts in the head! They mistreat us here in Africa, there is nothing we can do! Fela is the only one who stands up against that which preaches about the injustices they commit! That's why they come after him, even though they can't accuse him! Fela is an innocent man! Part of the Nigerian press resurrects the old accusation of aggression And deliberately tries to portray Fela as "Public Enemy #1" Fela represents a real threat to the establishment He must be discredited at any price. But the fabrication of the charges is so massive that Fela is released on bail after 10 days The case is dismissed soon after. Fela still thinks about running in the 1983 presidential election Even knowing that your application will probably not be accepted But "The Queens" remain lively The Shrine is officially closed SHRINE - DANGER ZONE FOR GOVERNMENT PEOPLE But Fela won't stop! Nothing can stop you from singing or speaking your mind What is happening in Nigerian jails It's nothing less than Nazism - What they did in the concentration camps In Germany in 1940... I saw with my own eyes how they beat boys at 8 am with 24 blows They put salt in their bodies before they beat them This wasn't court order - it was just fun! When these boys get there, they're waiting for the judgment Put 50, 60 of them in a small room And they start beating them because they are prisoners. Everything there is so bad! I will tell you an experience I was there in prison 15 days We had a baisin as a toilet A guard arrives... He sees the baisin and says to bring it to him Then they reply: 'Boss, I can't eat in this' it wasn't me who said I felt too much pain to be able to speak You know, my body was just pain! I want to assure you of one thing: If you think I'm going to change Or make allowances for my attitude or expression In my way of life or political objective... They're making me stronger I'm much stronger now I was even surprised at how quickly I recovered, considering the beating I took Do you want to see the police beating? It's terrible, I'll show you, you have to see it! Look! My whole back to the ass Do you see? Bad! All over my body, man! From top to bottom! They beat me to hell! But I didn't die Because my name is Anikulapo! I have death in my pocket I can't die can't kill me You are the thief! [chorus] I'm not a Thief! You are the tramp! [chorus] I'm not a bum! It was you who stole it! [Chorus] I didn't steal it! You are the bandit! [Chorus] I'm not a bandit! It was you who robbed at gunpoint! [chorus] It wasn't! I'm not the thief! [chorus] You are the thief! I'm not the tramp! [chorus] You're the tramp! It wasn't me who stole it! [chorus] It was you! I'm not the bandit! [chorus] You're the bad guy! It wasn't me who robbed at gunpoint! [chorus] It was you! Discussion about theft Someone took something that belongs to someone else On the street, everywhere, people walk... Office workers, construction workers, all kinds... I'm going Go inside the buses motorcycle scaffold A huge crowd! Within this crowd sometimes on a corner sometimes on a street You hear a scream Handle! Handle! Thief! Thief! Thief! Handle! Handle! Tramp! Handle! Handle! bandit! Pega! Segura! Grab! Corre atr�s! Will start to look I'm going to start chasing you Will start to look Will start watching will grab Give them a good beating They lynch him very well The police arrive very well take him to court Hold for 6 months [chorus] Will leave for a year They think it's better to arrest for 2 years - An innocent [chorus] They're going to jail for 5 years You're going to jail for 7 years [chorus] They're going to jail for 10 years They will execute you for armed robbery Instead of workers we have officers Instead of them taking the bus They ride in wagons Instead of riding a motorcycle Helicopter video Instead of going after a worker walks through them the authorities steal The public contributes a lot of taxes It is the authorities who steal Authority is not a pickpocket What they steal is no small thing The armed thief needs a weapon Authority needs pen The authority is in charge of the money He doesn't need a gun He needs a pen The pen gives powers that a weapon cannot. If a weapon steals 80,000 naira The pen will steal 2 billion naira You won't hear them screaming: [chorus] Thief! You won't hear them screaming: [chorus] bum! You won't hear them screaming: [chorus] bandit! they have another way Their style is civilized All of them bums! authorities stealing We Africans have to do something about this nonsense! I have read about ITT (telecommunications company) Because they are one of the largest multinationals, they are great explorers in this world I've heard about the harm they've done to the world I heard stories in the USA, Europe, Chile....everywhere But I didn't really know what ITT was about until I got to know the very MKOAbiola (President of ITT Nigeria) It was then that I saw the kind of multinational evil they are trying to do. I ask myself: 'What is multinational?' Are all Nigerians unnational, Why are some multinationals? So the question arises: 'What can I do about it?' Some time ago Mr. MKOAbiola Reported me to the police on August 27, 1979 Accused me of having robbed his wife The police came to investigate the matter And found out that at 5pm that day I was performing on TV About 150 miles away from where this alleged robbery took place So I went after him, I wanted the police to accuse him of giving false information But the police and government covered up this story That was 3 or 4 years ago So you see how these people are That's where the story of the 2.8 billion naira came from I gave a statement and clearly understood The lies, criminality and theft of the nation by a specific group of people The government! Do you see what is happening in Nigeria? I need to sing about these things! I need to sing clearly so people understand It's because of the European that we carry shit [chorus] It's been a long time It's part of their culture to carry shit In the time they came to colonize us We were taught to carry shit A long, long, long time ago The African man didn't carry shit It was the European who taught us Many foreign companies Take all our money away [chorus] Say it, say it 1981 SCOTTISH LAGOS GAMES Newspapers write in serious English to confuse African dwarves I read about one of the biggest companies It's called ITT Cause confusion Cause corruption Case inflation Cause confusion Cause oppression Case inflation Confusion, opression, inflation, opression! that's how they do it choose an african A man of little intelligence Give him a million naira To become a worthless boss They bribe him for a million naira To become a worthless boss Like rats they go and do things From corner to corner, passing and passing passing under passing inside passing by outside What harm does the US do to Africa? They divide people, they bring weapons, false ideas, Christianity, Jesus Christ... They mess up people's heads, bring fertilizer, do shit... They want to bring western civilization here The US and England want to brainwash Africans It's the colonialists, the slave traders Oppression begins Start stealing money Like Obasanjo and Abiola INTERNATIONAL THIEF THIEF - ITT International Thief - ITT We will fight them very well! One day! Let's finish them off one day! Everyone knows that Africa has to unite now to achieve something But how will this happen? It's a good question! If I can lead this country, Africa will be fine... When there is a good government in an African country All of Africa will be liberated With just one good, honest, progressive, clean government... Who knows what he's doing... No diplomacy or concessions No agreement! No Marxism-Leninism, no capitalism... And yes, Africanism! Music is our weapon! Music is the future! Music is the weapon of the future! And something tells me I'm right! I will be president one day, believe me! FELA RANSOME-KUTI Died August 3, 1997 Victim of AIDS
