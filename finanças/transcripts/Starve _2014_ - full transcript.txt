You don't have to do this. This isn't you, mike. Oh, god! Oh, god! I'd never hurt you. You know that! You don't have to kill anyone. Michael, no! I love you. stop, goddamn it! Good, good. Well done. You've earned your reward. It's feeding time. That was a battle a long time in the making. Could've gone better. What a shame. And you worked so hard to earn that meal. Seems the sacrifice you made was all for nothing. I can sympathize. Wasn't your fault, you had no choice. Runyan, bring me the girl. No, no, no! No, no, no! No, not deb! Not her! stop, no! Maybe next week, I'll put you up against one of my other champions. Until then... sorry. What was it this time, hon? Was it a bear? Maybe a raccoon? Dog? A rabbit? A rabbit. Oh, well, god forbid there's one less rabbit in the world. Why the morbidity, darling? Morbid sells, baby. Pays for those glasses on top of your head. You know, there's this thing called the internet, which would be so much cheaper than a 300-mile road trip. You know more than anybody, you gotta come to these places. You gotta... see these people, you gotta hear their stories. You gotta get a feel for them. Right? Besides, who else gets to write off a road trip on their taxes? Carnies, roadies, truckers, gypsies-- Gypsies don't pay taxes, baby. You know, I just don't know what the problem was with those superhero books. You hated that superhero comic. I didn't hate it. No, you literally said, "I hate this comic." Superman is a superhero. Spiderman, wonder woman, these are superheroes. Trigger happy, a teenage school-shooting survivor who becomes a shotgun-toting vigilante-- That is not a superhero. Trigger happy is a superhero. He kills bad guys. Trigger happy plays dead. He makes people dead. He was playing dead because he was trying to survive. All superheroes have to hide. Right? Head shot master. You got your bat cave, fortress of solitude, where superman hangs out, or he puts his glasses on and he's clark kent. That's hiding. All superheroes hide. God, I don't know how people used to bang in the back of these things. There's like no room. It's very uncomfortable. Why do you think it only happened in the seventies? Ew, ew. Will you help me with this? What do you think? It's making me kinda hungry. I need a title. I need something with some teeth. Something with some... Which one is this? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. These are the feral kids that live in the sinkholes. Right, the cannibals that live in the sinkholes. Mutated by the poison and that, uh, correct me if I have this wrong, okay, they feast on campers. Standard. And not to mention kidnapping and raping beautiful young women to continue the bloodlines. I mean, we have to do that. Since you're already completely ripping off "the hills have eyes" anyway, you might as... Hey, you know what you should call it? "the ground has holes." That's kind of sexy. Dude... Your fuckin' head has holes. Hey, hey, guys, guys. Freedom! There's freedom, florida. Thirty years ago, methane deposits came here and they opened up and they created these giant sinkholes all over the place, right? The government had to come in here and they had to forcibly shut this entire town down. Witnesses would say there were these feral cannibals that would come up out of the sinkholes and they'd chase people and they'd eat people. Hey, you keep it up, you're gonna be missing out there with them. You know, these people must when we come down here asking them about this bullshit urban legend, which actually happened... this town's their claim to fame. I met this guy online. Oh, you met a guy online? I met a guy online. Is he nice? Does he have a brother? He said that he swore he saw a feral kid running around out there. He used to throw rocks at people from bushes on the side of the road if you drove too close to him. Yeah. Bro, that's definitely just some kid in his mom's basement messing with you. Even if he was messing with me, it makes for a cool story, man. All right? And when are you gonna get a fucking job? Why don't you just propose to your fiancee? Yeah, beck, why don't you? fuck. Are you okay? Yeah. you fuck. You fuck. Beck! You're fuckin' dead! Beck, wait! Beck, get back here. Beck! No! He's throwing rocks off the bridge! What do you want me to do?! I don't give a fuck! You said this town was dead, so, please, if there are kids, it won't be hard to find them. Go back down. Come on, man, she's right. The damage is already done. There's nothing we can do about it now. Come on, let's go, beck. We'll find the kid, we'll get the windshield fixed. If it was a kid, what, is his dad gonna have a windshield for me? If we find the kid's dad then, I don't know, maybe he'll buy us lunch or something. What do you care? I buy your lunch for you anyway. Just get in the goddamn car, beck. How expensive do you think their nicest cabernet is? I'm gonna go wash my hands. Very clean lady. This place isn't very clean. Hi. Can we get some menus or something? Agnes. Yeah, yeah, stu. Keep your pants on. Hey.hi. Hi, there. Well, here ya go. Here you go. Yeah. Thank you, darlin'. Stu here is a real gourmet when it comes to frying. Best burgers in town. Do you have any vegetarian dishes? I could throw a little bird seed on the ground, let you peck at it. That'd be nice. He's an idiot, I'm sorry. So, uh, we spoke on the phone last week about your local legend. Oh. Yeah. Shit. my name is beck, and this is my brother, jiminey. Like the cricket? yeah, like the cricket, yeah. Every few months, someone comes this way wanting to know all that hogwash about cannibals, or sinkers, livin' in the sinkholes. Well, I wanna use the myth as the basis for my graphic novel. Ooh. Agnes? Reload. Excuse me. I'll be with you in a sec. Hey, deary. Hi. Your bra's showing. for an extra dollar, you can get whatever you want put on a stick. That includes 8 chicken tenders. And a tetanus shot. A tetanus shot. So how long's this gonna take? Just hear what she has to say. Besides, I wanna find out about who fucking broke my windshield. Hey, I'm thinking this might be more of a bag a chips and a coke kinda place. Well, have you decided on anything yet? Actually, just thinking about maybe a couple of bags of doritos. And some cokes. That's it? Yeah, that'll be fine, yeah. I'm sorry we can't be of more help to you. You know, we picked up this place back in '94. It's been fairly quiet around here since then. Except for those wrestler kids. Remember that, stu? Uh-huh. What happened to the wrestler kids? Oh, four wrestlers from puckettville came through here snooping around. Snooping around? Disappeared. Townsfolk actually claimin' they were eaten by feral children. Even the fbi got involved. Never found a trace. You know, you can get swallowed up by the ground out there. That part of the legend is true. Hmm. You know, I tried telling you on the phone not to come out this way. There was no reason for it. If I were you, I'd drive back before you become part of the story. Well, let's hope that doesn't happen. Did you get everything you needed? Can we go? Um, actually, do you know if there's any kids left in town because somebody threw a rock at my windshield, and I'd really like to talk to his parents. This here is a ghost town, deary. Stu and I live in a trailer out back. As for old ezrin here, well, he's the site manager, or the town mayor, as we like to call it. Ain't that right, ezrin? Uh, sir, is there information you can give us about these sinkers? If you are the town mayor or manager or whatever, I mean, you must know something, right? You go take a drive through town, see for yourself. I don't think that's a good idea. Yeah, I don't know. Beck, it sounds kinda dangerous. Stay on the asphalt, you'll be okay. Don't go in any houses, and stay the hell away from that high school. Okay. Um... Well, thank you so much for your hospitality. Sure. How much do I owe you? 2.50. 2.50? Okay, well, here's 3. There you go. Thank you so much. Thank you. Appreciate it. No, thank you. Let's go. Bye. Bye. Bye. Buh-bye. You don't seriously wanna go driving around out here, do you? Actually, I was kinda hoping that you would drive. Oh. Thank you. Can you deal with this? Thank you, buddy. You be careful with that thing. Okay... would you be careful? Help me with this, huh? Can we please get back to civilization? You can't tell me you don't wanna go see a real urban legend. That's an oxymoron. Yes, it is. I'll leave that there, okay. Can I get in the trunk, babe. Oh, get me. Move. Get out of the fucking shot. Let him take his pictures. Look, I know, I know things have been a little difficult lately. Right? Yeah. There's something out there for me. I know this, okay? I just feel this. Well, you know you did write your entire infinity series in our one-bedroom apartment and you didn't have to go to mars to have some mind-bending personal experience. Honey, if I could've go to mars, we would've gone to mars. Right, but you still wrote it. Come on, dudes! Let's roll. We need the money. We do. Besides, you can't tell me you're not the least bit interested in this. I am, but it's just not... Really the right time. Okay, look, we'll drive slow. Okay? Take some photos, and then we're gonna go to miami. And we're gonna have an awesome time in miami. I'm gonna go to my presentation, and I'm gonna present this stuff to the publishers, and I'm gonna be able to write a graphic novel, maybe sell a movie. Who knows? We can get a house. We can even get married. Did you just bribe me with marriage? It's only a bribe if you accept it, so... And I can't accept it unless you sell the movie rights to a comic book you haven't written yet? Just give me an hour. Can we do it in like a half hour? I'm still really hungry. Y'all can bang later. Fine, one hour, and we're not getting out of the car. Will you get in the back? Come on. I hate this car so much. Oh, stop complaining. Oh, my god, here we go. jesus. Sorry. We're gonna get a lot of bugs in our teeth. Yeah, we are. Freedom! Freedom! The brights don't even work. I told jiminey to fix that. He's just been slacking. Big surprise. Hey, hey, you could make a killing as a painter out here. I've never been anywhere like this before. I don't think anybody's ever been anywhere like this before. Seems like such a waste, you know? Like, why don't you, I don't know, put homeless people out here, like sex offenders and stuff? Well, I mean, sinkholes and methane poisoning probably have something to do with it. I wonder how far this place goes. What do you think? This town's like, only 1200 people used to live here, so I don't think it's that big. It seems so tiny. Hey, I gotta pee. Can we pull over? Come on, man, not now. Now? What do you mean, not now? I gotta go. But we just left. I don't wanna pull over here. Yeah, but I didn't go there. just stop. Whoa, hey. Jiminey... Jim, stop. Jiminey. Oy! My fuckin' brother. This place is wide open. You're not supposed to go in the house, jiminey. Look at this. Hello? You're not supposed to go in the house! God, that house is creepy as shit. We just had the conversation at the diner about this. I know. I think he's adopted. Beck! What? Come look at this shit, man. This is crazy. Dude, get in the car. You don't wanna Miss this. Go in and get him. Will you come with me? No, I will not come with you. Why not? Because I don't wanna go in there. Well, I don't wanna leave you out here. This place is-- I'll be fine, it'll be five minutes. Be quick. Just... be quick. Okay, all right. Jiminey? Jiminey! I saw someone out there. Was it a sinker? You are so sexy when you scowl at me, you know that? Come here. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay, it's just kinda... Freaky. What? The plumbing doesn't work. No shit. Except for the stinker I just dropped. Ew. Can we stop using the work "sinker," please? I said "stinker." I think he said "stinker." It was stinky. It was a floater. Stinker, sinker, gross. I don't-- It was a stinky sinker. Oh, right. is that the car? hey! What the fuck? Fuck! It's a goddamn ghost town. Who steals a fucking car in a ghost town? You left the keys in the car. I-I-I told you not to go in the house, and I told you there was somebody was out here. This is my fault? You left the keys in the car, and this is my fault? Yes, it's your fault. You left the keys in the car! You left me alone in the car! Fuck. We're so fucked. Why'd you leave the keys in the car? Because I was scared and I didn't think about it! This is a great fucking idea for a comic book. Beck, we don't wanna hear about the comic book. I don't care about that right now. It's a fucking joke, candice! I don't have any signal. Do you have bars? No. All right, let's just start walking. Walk? We've been driving for miles. We're not walking. You've been sitting on your ass for miles. Hey, come on, stop, leave it alone. You weren't cramped up in that tiny back seat. Let's go. Come on, both of you. Stop. What do you wanna do, just sit here? Start a fire? Make a camp site? Let's go. We have to walk. We don't have another option. What are you doing?! Stop! Leave her alone. Oh, fuck! My phone! She's been giving me shit since she didn't want me to come on the road trip. Now she's blaming me for this? Just tell her to get up and let's go walk back to the diner. Will you just go to the diner for me? What, alone? It's like six fucking miles. That's bullshit. Come on, use your track and field skills. And she's just gonna sit? I do shit for you all the time. I do shit for you all the time. Will you do one thing for me? That's what this is? That I've never-- It's not about you and your fucking insecurity issues. 'cause I'm so useless, 'cause you just do everything for me. Guys, come on. Oh, thank you, jiminey. Hurry back, please. I think you'd have better luck with smoke signals. Candice, I'm sorry. At least talk to me, you're killin' me. I don't think there's really anything to say. You know, one day, we're gonna laugh about this. We're gonna be driving along, telling our kids the story about the time we got trapped in a ghost town and carjacked by chud. I feel like we should walk. You want to? Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna try to go get a signal one more time. Then we'll head back to the diner. Okay. I'm gonna get up here. Be careful. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? Hello? Hello? What is your name? Hey, yeah, my name is beck davis, and my car has been stolen. I'm in freedom, florida. Where is the nearest... it's 50 miles outside of puckettville. What is the-- You're calling from? my number is 813-305-- Sir? Hello? Hello? Sir, I need... hello? My name is beck davis. Sir? Yeah, hey, I can hear you. My car has been stolen, I'm outside of freedom-- fuck. Beck! My number is 813-305-46-- Hello? I'm sorry, could you please repeat that? Hello? It's 813... Beck! 305... Hey, beck, I saw the car! Hang on. Hi, hello. I just lost you. Beck, our car's out front. is there a number I can call you back on? Yeah, yeah, my number's, it's 813-305-- Sir... hello? Uh, never mind, never mind. I just found the car, never mind. Candice? Candice? Candice, hey, I think, I think jiminey found the car. Candice? Fuck, where you at? Candice? Fuck. Candice? Candice? Hey, candice! Candice! Candice? Hey, you, motherfucker! Hey, hey! Motherfucker! fuck! Beck, help! Where am I, beck?! Please help me! beck! This is the principal speaking. The word of the day is "inanition." Noun. The exhausted condition that results from lack of food and water. who are you?! Where are we?! candice! Candice! I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome our new students to orientation. Why are you doing this to us?! Please don't interrupt the principal when he's speaking. have you ever thought about what people are capable of if pushed to the brink of death? I have a theory: If I starve a man long enough, he'd be willing to do anything to save his own skin... Maybe even kill you for nothing more than a sandwich. It's a horrible position for someone to find themselves in. It's even worse if it's the life of someone you love that's at stake. Motherfucker! Candice, I'm coming! Now, the destructive lady here great with child, got special plans for you. I'm sure you'll embrace the school spirit and be full of viking pride before we know it. ah! Ah! candice, I hear you! Candice! Hang on, baby. Hang on. Candice! candice! Shhh! You have to whisper. They don't like it when we talk to each other. Who doesn't like it? The zookeepers. We're in their world now. You seem like a nice person. Now, I'm a nice person. I'm a nice person. You help me, and I can help you. We can both get out of here. That's the only way out. You won't fit. Neither will my daddy. I do, but I won't leave without him. Who are these people? he's coming. never let it be said that runyan doesn't have a sense of humor. that was a cruel practical joke. Allow me to make it up to you by offering you the opportunity to enjoy a balanced breakfast. Wouldn't you like that? beck, what's going on? Candice, be quiet. help me to beat my weakness to death. Rid me of my tender feelings and release me from my fears. Help me to beat my weakness to death. Hey. I don't wanna know anything about you. What do you mean you don't wanna know anything about me? Where the fuck are we? He wants us to kill. Then eat. Then he starves us again. Then kill. Then eat. Then kill. What do you mean he wants us to kill? I killed four. Maybe six. My wife was number three. Five! Killed five. It's all right. It's all right. Just stay back, okay? Stay the shhh! Fuck back. When the bell rings, just be very still... Look, I'm not fucking dying today. That's not how it works! God damn it! Who do I have to kill to get a square meal around here? Please ring the bell. I'm dying in-- This is the principal here to remind you that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Ring the bell, dickhead! What if I refuse to fight? Fuck you! Refuse? Fair enough. This one time only, I'm willing to allow a substitution. Think your woman will put up a better fight than you? You motherfucker. Don't! Runyan, return this foul-mouthed coward to his chambers and fetch me the girl. No, no. No, no, no! Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight! No, no, no, no! No, I'll fight! I'll do it, just leave her out. Okay, I'll fight. Yes! All right! That hunger in your belly craves food. That fire in your belly wants to be reunited with your beloved. Breakfast is getting cold. When the bell rings, you have a chance to quell the former and maintain hope for the latter. I know, I've been there. Let it nourish you. Ring the bell. Ring the goddamn bell! ah! Ah! Ah! Just stop, okay? Please. Please, stop. ya! Stop! Stop! Motherfucker, stay down! Stay down! Milk does a body good! Milk does a body good! Pass it on! Don't make me do this. Don't, don't! Ahh! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Don't make me do this. Doesn't work that way. Ah! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. score one for the newcomer. Congratulations! Hope you've got a hankering for bacon and eggs. Get it while it's hot. It's the last you'll be getting for a while. Have it your way. Runyan, take the food. No, no, no. I'll eat it, I'll eat it. I'll eat anything. what a waste of food. Don't you know there are starving children in south dakota? Look on the bright side, in case you get your appetite back: Finger food. psst, hey! I saw you eat that bug. That's nasty. Here, take this. I found this. I'm bringing it to my daddy. He's going to save everybody. I'll be back to get you. Wa-wa-wait. There's only one monitor. Lots of cameras, one monitor. Tell beck. But be careful. He's watching him right now. Okay, I got this. I got ya! no! No! put me down! Put me down! put me down! Put me down! Hillbilly motherfucker. You okay? Nice shoes. Thanks. Candice said he has one monitor, lots of cameras. One monitor. I think it's time for a donner party. Oh, shit. I call him donner. If you know your history, then you can guess why... And what food he has come to develop a preference for. Come close. I'll take this off you. Nora, nora, nora, you were doing so well here, and yet here you are attempting to cut class. Truancy is not tolerated at freedom high. It is punishable by suspension, expulsion, or execution. There's no food to be won from this fight, at least not for you. You win, you live. You won't. Allow me to introduce you to my, for lack of better description, reigning champion. Hide. Do something. The word of the day is "gourmandize." Transitive verb. Means to eat gluttonously or ravenously. come on, you're almost there. Go, go, go, go, go. hey! Hey, donner! Come on, buddy! Look at this. Look at this, huh? Hey, hey, hey! Winner! And still undefeated. No surprise. Runyan, it's time for this afternoon's main event. oh, shit. they say woman can be much more cruel to each other than men. I sure hope so. Guys love a good cat fight! I've taken to calling this one virago. Already done a word for the day, so this is extra credit. "virago," noun. Means a loud, ill-tempered, violent woman. You're about to find out why. fuck! Fuck! whore! You shit-faced whore! Oh, my god. Fucking whore. motherfucking, cock-sucking son of a bitch! fag fucker! Fag fucker! Shitface! Shit! Shit! Shithead! Shit-motherfucking whore! Whore! You suck cock! feast or famine, candice. ahh! Ahh! the taste of victory truly is the sweetest. Isn't it? ahhh! Candice?! Candice?! I won that fight. Gimme my food. get up. that's the principal's office. They're in there. what? What? Oh, my god! Oh, fuck. I thought I wasn't going to see you again. Have you been fed? You? Not really. I am so sorry. I am so sorry for bringing us here. This is totallyit's not my fault. Your fault. This is my fault. It's not your fault. It's the principal's fault... How is it not my fault? Wherever the fuck he is. There must be a dozen people caged up in this hell house. He is filming us kill each other for food. We're gonna die, aren't we? No. No, no, no, you cannot, you can't think like that, okay? Look, you can't think like that, okay? Jiminey's--he's probably got the national guard roaming the streets looking for us, all right? I promise, we're gonna make it out of this, okay? We're gonna make it out of this. Oh, god. You look really nice, you know that? You're beautiful. Thank you. you promised me food. Give me my food! Stop, stop, stop. Candice, just stop. He's got it! Let me handle this. Can I? can I take it to her? Can I? Let me do it. Just let me give it to her, okay? Here, let me give it to the lady. beck, get back! What are you doing? You ate that whole thing? You ate my food? Candice, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm just so hungry. Beck, I'm so hungry. I'm hungry. I'm pregnant. What? What? time to go. Your dinner is waiting, runyan. Oh, my god. Can we get her some more food, please? Please! Just one more piece. There's gotta be more. Can she have some more food, please? Please? Runyan? Runyan. That's your name, right? Bring me some food. I'll do anything. Please? I'll do anything you want. You're right. You will do anything. That's how desperation works. There is no blame. Now, runyan, it's dinner time. Just walk away. Please. Wait, runyan. Please, come back. Don't leave. Don't leave! What kind of person does that?! They're insane, baby, stop. I don't mean them, I mean you! Last week you're ready to marry me, now you'll let me starve! Stop it! Stop! Stop. Just listen to me. What do you want me to do? I'll do anything, okay? You want me to stick my fingers down my throat? What do you want me to do, huh? You want me to put my fingers down my throat? You'd do that for me? you like that new girl, don't you? remind you of someone? I don't want you to get too attached. Remember what happened last time? Will you burn the rest of the dead folk? It's starting to smell around here. With the exception of that couple, it's been a while since anyone stuck their nose in where it don't belong. Them cages I made weren't built to sit empty. You know? hi, ezrin. The usual? Yep. Gonna need a to-go order as well. You got it. Stu, burgers. mornin'! Passing through? I'm looking for some missing persons. You seen these people? Oh, dear. I take it that's an affirmative? About a month ago. Came through on research or something. Kept asking about the sinkers. Sinkers? Oh, feral townsfolk living in the sinkholes out there. A lot of urban legend hooey. You know, the last time I saw them, they were mulling over whether to go sightseeing into town, not that there's much sights to see. I saw 'em. Caught them stealing from one of the houses. Not gonna lie to you, pulled a gun and told them if I ever saw them again, I'd blow their heads off. Last I saw, they were hightailing it out of town, driving like maniacs. You never told me any of this. Wasn't worth mentioning. And who are you? Just call me ezrin. I'm a site manager, mayor. That a joke? You know about freedom? Sinkholes, the mercury, the mining? Whole damn town being evacuated back in '81? I'm aware of what happened here. Now the county pays me to keep people off the property to avoid losses and such. Officially, I'm the site manager. Unofficially... The mayor. Then you're the right man to take me to have a look around. Told you, there's nobody allowed on the property. Well, the property is the last place anybody saw who I was looking for. So, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist. No. Look, I'm not gonna eat up a bunch of your time, but if I'm forced to involve the police department, pull a warrant, it's gonna be a lot more inconvenient for everybody involved. So what do you say? Suit yourself. Here you go. Put it on my tab. hey. This is the house I caught them looting. What's the name of this street? No use for a name. What were they driving? Didn't get a clean look. Where do you live? Around. This gonna take much longer? That school we passed a few blocks back, I'd like to check that out. Bad idea. Why? Not safe. Which is exactly why I wanna make sure they didn't end up there. I think he likes you. How long has he been looking at me like that? About 10 minutes. And you didn't wake me? Are you happy to be awake? Will you bring us food? I think he's been through as much as we have. Can you speak? Can you bring us food? Well, that went well. I apologize in advance for the mess. I really wasn't expecting any company, you know? Come on, come on. Jesus. Sinkholes definitely aren't urban legend. Let me get the lights. Runyan! Things may have gotten a little complicated. Take this to the showers. please, the principal said I'd get a chance to eat this week. I'll do whatever you want. I know you will, norman. help! Jesus! What did he do to you? You should be more concerned about what I'm gonna do to you. beck, come on! Slow. We're getting out of here tonight. what is this place? I don't know what you're up to, but you're not gonna-- have you ever thought about what people are capable of if pushed to the brink of death? Starvation! What do you want?! In the beginning, you're just ripe with hunger. Then the body begins eating itself, first the fat, then the muscles. Emaciation, lack of proteins and minerals, disease begins to set in. The worst is what it does to your body, your mind, your will, your spirit. But it makes for great entertainment. Just so there's no confusion, this is a fight to the death. This man is already half-dead! Then it should be easy for you. Ahh! Put it down! Will you kill this man, this poor, wretched victim of society, just to save your own skin? If not, he's gonna feast upon your grave. At the bell... One... Don't. I'm sorry. So sorry. Two... Sick bastard! ahh! don't come at me again. Ahh! Shit! I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm so... no! I won't. I won't play your sick fucking game! I won. Feed me! beck. candice? Candice? Candice? you were throwing up on yourself, so I turned you over. Jiminey? Man, I didn't know if you were alive or dead. Both. You don't think like that, jiminey. Put that out of your mind. I was so hungry. I didn't want to. it hurts. Cain and abel. You have no idea how much I've been looking forward to this match-up. What the fuck is wrong with you? I've been meaning to ask you: Who names their kid jiminey like the talking cricket? What a stupid name. You don't have shut up. To do this. You know, in the original story of "pinocchio" -- Not that disney crap, the original story-- Shut the fuck up. Pinocchio killed the cricket. Took a hammer to jiminey and squashed him. Shut the fuck up! You willing to do that, beck? Squash jiminey, your own brother? It's just the two of us. We're gonna make it out. Just stop. Stop. I killed him. I put my hands around his throat, and I fucking killed him. I felt his throat crush. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. You're okay. I killed him. The word of the day is "fratricide." Noun. The act of a person killing his or her own brother. you have to let it go. Who else did you kill?! I heard you! You were begging for forgiveness like a fucking child! Who was it you killed, huh?! Was it your wife? Let me guess, it's not your fault! You think killing us is gonna make it better?! what about you? Your son? You killed his mom. Is it your fault? You really have no idea what you're talking about, do you? If you can survive your brother, you'll be one step closer to knowing. Jiminey, don't. Come on, jiminey. Come on. Give him the gun already, runyan. I want to find out if blood is thicker than hunger. Only one bullet. Don't get any crazy ideas about shooting your way out of here. I bet you could kill for a steak about now. or are you gonna be the conscience of your namesake? I'm not gonna kill you, jiminey. Put the fucking gun down now, jiminey. I love you. Put the fucking gun down. we're brothers, jiminey. I love you. I love you. We're supposed to take care of each other. You've always been such a good brother to me. You took care of me. It's my turn to take care of you. Jiminey, come on, just put the gun down. No! what drama. Though I don't think you've earned the right to eat since you didn't actually kill your brother. Got an idea for your funny book. It's about three people that nose around someplace they shouldn't have, one of which, a writer looking for a scary story. I'm gonna fucking kill you. But he becomes a horror story instead, and his wife, barefoot and pregnant. I'm gonna fucking kill you. You hear me? You hear me?! I'm gonna fucking kill you! Let me out! No! No! You fucking dead yet?! Huh?! Let's make it your turn now. Come on, fight me. Come on. My word of the day is "pussy," you fucking pussy. The definition is fight me, you fucking pussy! I'm a fucking brown belt, bitch. That man of yours pisses me off. You don't wanna piss me off. Porn's not my thing, but I'm gonna make an exception. Sorry I met your boy. Watch me fuck his woman. I hope you like it rough. Beck! Beck! Beck! Beck! Beck! Candice! Beck! Candice! Beck! Beck, where are you? Beck! Where are you going? Ahh! Beck! Candice, no! No, no, no! Don't come in here, candice! Stay out, candice! Stay out! She's coming! Beck! stop. Stop. Fucking stop! I'm gonna fucking kill you. Kill me? You on about that again? Okay, okay. Who is she? A man, his wife, and son live in a town called freedom. Once thriving, but no more. Declared it a disaster area, government seizes the land, and it becomes a forgotten footnote. this family, their car gets swallowed up in one of these sinkholes. No one knows they're down there. No one around to look for them. No food. A jug of water for the motor that kept overheating, the only thing keeping them alive. To eat or die-- Many scientists will tell you death from starvation is really not that painful. The worst is what is does to your body, your mind, your will, your spirit. You find out just what kind of person you are when your physical self wastes away, what you're capable of, like killing your own son and eating him to keep yourself alive a few more days in hopes the rescue would come. What does that have to do with us? Someone finally found me. You know how we repaid him? We killed him. There's no going back to polite society after that. and my wife... When were down in that hole, some of that methane leaked in. Had a very unpleasant effect on my girl. That's why she stays covered up. Society left us to waste away and die in a place it also left to waste away. Freedom is ours now. So when the good folks as yourselves coming nosing around, we got this little game we like to play, give you a little taste of what we went through. It's all right, darlin'. He forced you, he forced you to murder your own son. Shut your mouth, pig! Give him one bullet. One bullet. Starve to death, or you can kill your wife and have at that dinner. Now if you'll excuse me, gotta roll. Wait a second. Let's just think this through. Give me the gun. Let's end this. Don't go getting all trigger happy on me. in case food isn't enough, how about oxygen? When the room fills with gas, you'll both be dead. Better act quick! shoot him, and you've got that steak waiting for you. Stop telling me what to do. Just give me I don't the gun. Wanna die. Just give me the gun or I'm gonna take it out of your hands, okay? Let me decide. Give me the gun. The situation is under my control for once. My decision. Do it. Shut up! Candice. Don't, candice. I love you, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't do this. I wasn't sure how this was gonna turn out, but I must say I am surprised. it was meant to be this way. Only the strong survive. it's nature's way. Runyan, bring me the girl. We got unfinished business. No, no, please. No! Don't! I told you I was gonna kill you. Stop, stop, stop. He's probably watching us right now. Okay, look, we gotta split up. Okay? We gotta keep him on his toes. You go find an exit. I'm gonna put an end to this before he kills anybody else. No... no! that hunger in your belly craves food. That fire in your belly wants to be reunited with your beloved. Score one for the newcomer. Ah, shit! Congratulations! Hope you've got a hankering for bacon and eggs. Get it while it's hot. It's the last you'll be getting for a while. Fuck. No, no, no. Have it your way. fuck! Good, good. Well done. You've earned your... stop! Help! Yes! Yes! The word of the day is "dilemma." Fuck you and your dictionary. You okay? Uh-huh. So, uh, what kind of superhero plays dead? trigger happy. What are you doing? I want my fucking car. Baby... I know this isn't the most appropriate time, but... Open up that glove box. Open it.
