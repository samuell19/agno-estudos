THE LAND POINT PLEASANT IS SITTING ON RIGHT NOW IS THE ONLY LAND IN NORTH AMERICA NEVER TO HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED BY INDIANS. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS INHABITED BY AN EVIL SPIRIT OR SOMETHING, RIGHT? INDEED. AND RIGHTFULLY SO. A BLOODY BATTLE WAS WAGED ON THESE LANDS. HUNDREDS OF INDIANS WERE MASSACRED. THE WHITE SETTLERS SHOWED NO MERCY. THE INDIAN CHIEF CORNSTALK HAD SEEN ENOUGH OF HIS PEOPLE'S BLOOD SHED. SO, HE CROSSED OVER THE RIVER TO WHERE POINT PLEASANT NOW STANDS, AND HE OFFERED THE WHITE SETTLERS A TRUCE. AND THEN THEY MURDERED HIM. WELL, NOT ONLY DID THEY MURDER HIM. THEY TORTURED HIM. NOW, THEY BEAT HIM RELENTLESSLY, WANTING TO KNOW WHERE THE FEW SURVIVORS OF HIS TRIBE WERE HIDING. BEFORE DYING, HE SUMMONED THE EVIL SPIRIT THAT THE INDIANS HAD FEARED FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS SO THAT HE MIGHT SEEK OUT HIS REVENGE AGAINST ANYONE WHO WOULD SET FOOT ON THIS LAND WITH THE BLOOD OF MURDER ON THEIR HANDS. [ RASPING ] BULLETS DID NOTHING TO STOP THIS HORRIFIC TRANSFORMATION, SO THEY PROCEEDED TO CUT HIS BODY INTO PIECES WHILE STILL ALIVE. [ GROANING ] THEY PLACED THE PIECES OF THE CHIEF IN A MIRROR-LINED COFFIN, HOPING IT WOULD TRAP THE SPIRIT. IT DID. NOW MOTHMAN CAN ONLY CROSS INTO OUR WORLD THROUGH REFLECTIVE SURFACES. WELL, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING REFLECTIVE IN HERE, SO I SEE YOU'VE LEFT NOTHING UP TO CHANCE. IF YOU WANT TO STAY ALIVE, YOU LISTEN TO OLD FRANK HERE. THERE'S AN EVIL IN POINT PLEASANT.

I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT IT DOES. I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES. IF IT HAS A REFLECTION, WE HAVE TO BREAK IT. CASEY, STOP HIM! DAMN IT! [ GRUNTS ] [ CRYING ] YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM JARED IN TWO DAYS. WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED WORRYING ABOUT SOME BROKEN MIRRORS, WHY DON'T YOU GO CHECK ON HIM? IF IT ISN'T TOO MUCH TROUBLE. HEY!
