Let him love some other squad. - Come on, let's bypass... - Uh-uh. One joker in there can hurt bookoo guys behind us. Yeah? How do you know there's only one? That's all I saw when I crossed the tracks. 'I'm gonna head for that flag.' - He'll open up if you run. - That's when you'll nail him. - Dead? - Yeah. Lay it on. Nicht schieben. No ammunition. Pity, don't shoot. No ammunition! Throw your weapon out. Now! Come out with both your hands on your head. - Understand. - I'm coming. Pity, don't shoot. No rifle, no bullets. I'm coming. Good. I don't speak that good. Oh. I've attended school. Many of us speak English. I guess, I'm lucky to be in one piece. You could have killed me. I am not a Nazi. Sure. You're no Nazi, I'm no soldier and there's no war. There is a difference between a Nazi and a German. Why don't you tell it to your friend Hitler here? It's verboten not to have him in every home. That used to be our shoulder patch till we switched to the thunder bird. The swastika. That's an old American Indian sign that Hitler copped from us. Believe it or not, the 45th division used to wear the swastika right here. An American soldier wearing a swastika? But we had it long before little Adolf got the idea. Hey, let me see that. - Who patched me up? - Please? My verwunden, who dressed it? I did. - Alone? - Yeah. Oh, no! I've dressed wounded soldiers before. - Oh, you a nurse? - Nein. You should not feel embarrassed. What's so funny? What? Uh, you'll have to sit down, standing up. That's what I get for being sandbagged in the rear. Sandbagged? What is that? Hey, there are some cigarettes in my cartridge belt. Help yourself. What's your name? Helga Schiller. I'm Sargent Brent. Aren't you gonna save that for later? You people, all over Europe, are always saving it for later. That's because they want a second cigarette. The whole pack. How do you eat? My brother forages food. - Where? - The countryside. - There's no food out there. - Franz finds them. He's a deserter, isn't he? Franz? He's only 15-years old. My brother has never killed anyone. - Hitler youth? - Yeah. Then he's old enough to kill. Did they ever put you in a concentration camp? I thought they put all you anti-Nazis in camps or killed them. My family lived a lie since 1933. What's that got to do with this? That was the year Germany was murdered by unser Fuhrer. But you all strung along while he was winning. - Didn't you? - Yeah, we believed him. Till it was too late to learn he was only interested in Hitler. Why didn't you Germans open your mouths when he started throwing people in the gas chambers? We are all guilty for not opening our big mouths. Should have let him bleed to death! Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. He blames you for his arm. It was an American bomb. And to him, all Americans are responsible. That crazy little jerk tried to kill me. He has tried. I am not fighting you, Hitler is. I thought it was a bomb. Relax. Relax, now. That's just my outfit moving in. They just probably spotted a cross... Germans are moving through the village. - How many? - Oh, many. Hold it. Hold it. That's ours. That's yours. 'Helga! Helga! Helga!' I don't blame you for being frightened. - This is your sister? - Ja. Schiller? Fraulein Helga Schiller. Is that your name? Yes, he's sick, he cannot defend himself. That is unfortunate for him. But the SS makes use of all people. Even one-armed boys. Don't worry about him, Fraulein. Our infantry has driven them back and our artillery will finish the job. I don't think that we'll have to use your brother in this fight. Oh, thank God! Thank who? I'm sorry. You thank the SS for it. God has nothing to do with this. They're checking all roofs as an observation post for our guns. The buildings are much safer on the Hitler Platz. No high enough observation. Once we've secure this village I advise you to stay away from those buildings. They'd be mined in case the Americans counterattack. He'll want to sleep here. You must help hide him, Franz. - And get a bullet in the head? - Franz, please. Turn me in. They'll treat me as a prisoner of war. The SS don't take prisoners. - Why didn't you tell him? - He'd kill her. They must find you away from here. 'Fraulein Schiller?' 'Fraulein Schiller?' - Come on, get there. - 'Fraulein Schiller?' Who's the woman in the double room? - My mother. - S-She is sick. Heart trouble. You get the equipment. About our, um, sleeping arrangements.. ...there are three others in my crew. The arrangements can be made to please. - Franz sleeps there? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. You're very courageous to remain here because of your mother. Oh, I'm sure you would have done the same thing. I turned my mother in to the Gestapo.. ...for treason. 'Helga.' - 'Helga!' - Ja, mutter? Have the Americans come yet? The SS are here. - He keep his mouth shut? - Yeah. - They're moving in? - Yeah. I must find a place for you. I don't get it. Why are you sticking your neck out for me? I will show you there is a difference between a Nazi.. '...and a German.' Give me a smoke first. Target, enemy infantry and tanks. 'Coordinates, 4-8-5-3-7-4.' Aah-h! - Can you make kaiserschmarren? - Oh, I-I.. Not really. But well, I will need some sugar and raisins and.. Oh, do not bother, leutnant. They keep falling all the time. Oh, it is no bother, Fraulein. In a few days you will have raisins and sugar. Our counterattack is showing results. Our only headache is the American Air Force. Nein. An over-stuffed close office. Besides, it's Heinrich Himmler who is now second in command. Oh, I was told that Himmler fled. What did you say? Well, I-I told them it was uh, a stupid lie to send a re-propaganda. Told who? Some soldiers. - Wehrmacht. - Ja. All those Wehrmacht swines are as jealous of the SS as the stupid generals are jealous of Himmler. If the Gestapo were to repeat such a lie they would wipe out your family. But I forget I heard this, Fraulein. And you will help me forget it. A little schnapps. Helga! Helga, the Americans are advancing. They're all over the place. O'Conway, go, check that wire going upstairs. Might be loose.. 'Come on, take them, buddy. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!' You're alone here? Huh? You're alone here, huh? Verstehen? 'Hey, meathead.' 'What took you so long getting here?' Dandy, old boy, we wrote you off KIA. What're you hiding there for? I caught one. They're okay. The girl patched me up. Battalion'll get you out in the morning unless those jokers get here tonight. Hey, check those buildings in the square they're booby trapped with mines. I'll mark them for the demo squad. Hey, you got a beauty there, sergeant. But watch yourself. Frauleins are verboten. Here, buster, chew yourself to death. There is nothing up there, but old... gear. Come on, hit the road. Let's go. Go. How's this? "Please, take care Fraulein Helga Schiller. "She saved my life and hid me from the SS troops. "She's a friend to all Americans. "She and her family are not Nazis. Sargent David Brent, C company 157th in, 345th division." Danke sehr. Danke you sehr. For the surgery. The AMG will take care of you. - AMG? What is that? - American Military Government. I haven't any traffic with them but I understand they will bite your head off. This letter of recommendation oughta give an idea that you're kosher. What if they do not believe it? What if they think you and I were geliebte. Geliebte? Lovers. And that you only wrote it because.. Well, I-I've been thinking about that myself. Sargent Brent. How I feel.. ...and what I can prove, well, they're not the same thing. As a child, I sang the "Horst-Wessel" song.. ...made brown shirts out of rags. I was raised on hate. But they would look into record, never into me. - And... - Don't you worry, Helga. I won't let anything happen to you. Even if I have to come back here, and prove it myself. Danke. But no American can help me. You heard what that soldier said. Frauleins are verboten. Well, Brent I guess you're itching to get home like all the rest of us. No, sir, I-I wanna stay on. What do you mean? I wanna stay on here in Germany. But you're one of the highest point men in my regiment. Those with lower points are being redeployed to the states for action in Pacific, fly to your home tomorrow. Oh. Well, I know it sounds crazy, sir. - You see I got a girl here. - Uh-huh. Well.. Your parents wrote me about her. They seem to be up in arms over some fraulein. Did you get her into trouble? No. No, sir, no. Nothing like that. Well, sergeant, all frauleins want to hook an American. A G.I. means chow. Cigarettes. Security. If you weren't an American, she'd want no part of you. I don't wanna see one of my tough rifle men get into a messy can't shoot his way out of. - I wanna marry her, sir. - She's a Nazi. Oh, look, colonel, you know how many Nazis I killed. Do you think I'd want to marry one? Have a kid by one? She saved my skin. Does that sound like a Nazi? And you know the kind of education she's had. She's no different than any others. Oh, but she is different, sir. Sergeant, there's a little story makin' its rounds. This might help you to clear up some of the smoke. Seems they found Hitler dead with a piece of paper in his fist on which he'd written "I was never a Nazi." Come on. Come on, hide. Please, Sergeant. Brent, you know the rules. - You will get into trouble. - What trouble? Non-fraternization rule. American soldiers fine $65 for talking to a German. A 65-dollar question, huh? Means nothing to me. - I told you I'd come back. - What do you mean come back? Oh, I'm going to stay around here. - Oh, I'm very sorry. - Sorry? Well, that you did not have enough points to go back home. Oh, I had enough points. Here, see if these fit. - You did not desert? - And if I did? Well, then I will have to hide you again. This time from your own soldiers. Helga. I'm a civilian. I got my discharge. From here on in, it's Mr. Brent. No, no. HerrBrent to you. My colonel came through for me. He got me a job as a civilian. Workin' for the Army. You know where? Right here in Rothbach. - Rothbach? - I'm gonna work for the AMG. And with food, sanitation. The works! Sort of a liaison between your Burgermeisterand the Army. Helga. I got my discharge pay and.. ...now I can either spend it for my fair home or our honeymoon. Honeymoon? Um, how do you say, uh.. Well.. That's all I could think about when I was in the hospital was you and me going down Rhine river on our honeymoon. I even studied up on that Rockenfeller ruins. The Mainz Tower, the Bishop of Mainz and the Lorelei. Look, Helga, if you say no, then I'll go back to America. 'Cause I don't any part of Germany without you. But there's no law saying a civilian can't marry a German. But it is verboten, you know. Oh, holy smoke. Everything in your country is verboten. Drinkin' verboten, rawking verboten.. Don't look, don't listen, don't speak, don't see, don't.. ...now it's don't love. Nobody can forbid us to love each other. if that's the way we feel about it and.. That's the way I feel about it. Nobody can put the kibosh on us in your country or mine. Well, it will not be easy for you being married to a German. Who cares? Who cares? So-so, a few G.I.s will make wise cracks and few Germans will look.. Oh, I-I love you, Helga. Will you marry me? Hey, watch it. Watch it. Those are a couple of American soldiers watching. Come. - Helga. - Come into the house. Come, Bruno. Come. Come into the house. Come. I'm just a little hazy about the geography of my own village. Bruno. It's better if you learn swiftly. Your mother and father were in it. It was a direct hit. I'm sorry to have to tell you this way. Oh, there're many still out at the woods, Bruno all over Germany. I put flowers on their rubble last week. Danke. Ilsa. How is Ilsa? Let me make some coffee for you. American coffee. She's dead? - Yeah. - How? She took her life. She thought that the Russians were coming. Oh, Bruno, it's been terrible.. It's a nightmare. But we are still fortunate to have a roof. Others are living in a cellar like rats with no food. No warmth, no electricity. And that terrible thing that we face every day. A defeat. There's a difference in being occupied and defeated. We are occupied. That is all. What are you talking about, Bruno? How is your mother? Is she still alive? But she's under borderline. She's been that way for months. And Franz? He's out picking up cigarette butts. At the end of the week, he sells his treasure for pipe tobacco. Yet I see you waste no time. - American food. - How else are we to eat? For the first time.. ...your sex.. ...has the advantage over mine. To all Americans, forbidden food is tastier. Oh, yeah. So stupid. This non-fraternization. Everywhere I go all over Germany.. ...It's the Americans with frauleins. And the law is that.. love making is verboten. When an American soldier calls on a girl.. ...they think he's farting. Bruno, whatever they call it. We have what they want. Yeah. Must be an opposite view. Has this American has in your body. Perhaps your lips can keep him warm. Long enough to obtain enough supply of food and cigarettes. He works for the military government. In the food office. It's good you've had the blitz medals. Yeah. I would have had trouble being denazified. - Will I go through that? - If you want to work. And if I'm not cleared? A Nazi is not bad enough to be thrown into jail and not good enough to be given the choice positions too. Put in the bucket brigade to clean the bomb debris. Cheap labor. Oh, some of your friends bought a certificate under black market certifying they were fellow prisoners in the concentration camp. This is temporary safety. I must have full clearance first choice job. Well, then you'll have to appear before the denazification court of Germans. And they will decide whether or not you're member of the party. And if the German doesn't like me, he can vote against me, huh? - Yeah. - Isn't that good? Unless you have a character witness. Character witness. Perhaps.. - Your lover can help. - Yeah, perhaps. This candy bar romance can lead to more things than just a passport to food. - Helga. - Hm? Do not lose your American gold mine. I'm going to marry my little gold mine. But how? Being a chocolate Romeo and secret is one thing. - But marrying is another... - Law does not affect him. - He's so important? - He is a civilian. He is HerrBrent, now. I'm going to be FrauBrent ...wife of an American. 'This is the American forces network.' 'American zone Germany.' 'Nazi plans for underground resistance against' 'the United States Army of occupation have been discovered' 'in Munich with the arrest of three Hitler youth members' 'charged with suppressive activity.' 'They belong to an organization called the Werewolf.' 'At Nuremberg, Hermann Goring and 21 major war criminals' 'will be charged with crimes against peace, war crimes' 'and crimes against humanity.' 'Martin Bormann's still missing, will be tried in absentia.' 'Now for good news. Fasching will once more be celebrated.' 'Going back as far as 1447' 'Faschingwas suppressed by Hitler in 1938.' Fasching, you will love it Herr Brent. What's it mean, FrauBrent? Well, it is, uh, carnival time. You know with the masks and costumes and dancing. It is when a man romances a woman not his wife and a woman with a man not her husband. Oh, that's out. That is out. I'm gonna not catch you faschingaround with some guy. I'm from a long line of jealous husbands. You come from a long line of wonderful husbands. Uh-huh. So kind, so thoughtful. You're so right. I was just thinking of Franz. That artificial arm has changed his whole life. Just goes to show what couple of cartons of cigarettes can buy. He's so proud of it. He's shown it to everyone in the village. Look. Remagen Bridge. 'What is left of it?' Yeah, I remember. I crossed it. 'Before the International Military Trib at Nuremberg' 'United States chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson told' 'the court that he not only is appearing his council for' 'the elite powers but for the entire civilized world.' 'He said, "The real complaining party at your bar "is civilization. "The responsibility for the aggressive war was clear. "despite Hitler's supreme command over the Nazi party "the United States, Russia, France, and Great Britain "claimed he was surrounded by men "who knowingly carried out heinous crimes. "The defendants in the dock claimed they have never heard "of wholesale murders, beatings, tortures "concentration camp gassings, genocidal eradication of whole "communities and the killings of surrendered elite soldiers. "They claim ignorance of their campaign "of arrogance, brutality, and annihilation such as the world has not witnessed since the Pre-Christian ages." Go ahead. I'll double check as you read them out. Right. Yeah. That's it. You've got 'em all. What? No, no, we don't want jurisdiction over them. Denazification is gotta be a German problem. Nobody knows a Nazi better than a German.. - Brent, get me that politician. - Yes, sir. The man's running for public office while being held in internment camp as a major Nazi offender. The worse part of it is people are scared. They testify against the Nazis and they're called collaborators informers, army lovers. AMG, Rothbach. Captain Harvey. Ah. Uh-huh. No, no, we don't want to convict the little fellas and let the big fish get away. Once that happens, every German will be fed up with the business of running down war criminals, what's the charge, Bruno? This man has stolen the food permit, captain. - Where did you get this? - I found it. - Lay off it. - Forgive me, captain. It's just that these thieves make me so angry. Especially this thief. His food permit was issued to Callowitz and signed by me. - Are you Callowitz? - He's Gunther Dietrich. That's right, captain. Gunther, Bruno and I served in the same infantry section. He was our demolition man. A mine sapper. Mine sapper? Can you defuse a bomb? - He's not to be trusted. - We can't be choosy. Not when two children and a farmer were killed last week stepping on mines, not with that unexploded bomb in the Martin Luther plots, your people are so desperate for a place to live they've ignored all warnings about living near that bomb. There are hundreds of villages all overloaded with bombs and mines, and we're short of sappers. Demolition men are as hard to find as food. - But he's a Nazi. - Show me a sapper who isn't. - Herr Burgermeister. - Yes, captain. Put Gunther to work defusing the bombs. You mean the one on the Martin Luther plots? That's right. Give him all the help he needs. Relax, Bruno. We'll keep an eye on him. Don't worry. We're working so hard, captain to build a new Germany and.. ...men like Gunther are sworn enemies we've seen. We'll build a democracy here even if it's with Nazi bricks. I do not understand, you Americans. Well, it's like being stuck in the gambling house. With loaded dice and marked cards. But if you trust any Hitler lover, you will lose. We know the wheel is fixed. But it's the only wheel in town. 'Come on, come on, before I clobber you.' Let go of me. Sir, I paid $65 for spratin with this fraulein. And look what this dirty croc did to her? Just for talkin' to me. My brother was killed fighting Americans where he died for prostitutes like this who fraternize.. - These are far more... - Shut up! You're gonna stay in jail for as long as it takes to grow back her hair, get him out of here, Bruno. As for you. I post you company commander. I'll see you get a blast for laying a hand on a German no matter what he's done. Yes, sir. - Franz. - Yes, sir. Follow through all that supply system. Work closer to the Burgermeister. We don't want a typhoid epidemic to hit us. What's the latest black market box score? A pack of cigarettes is still worth ten bucks a nickel candy bar, five bucks, a cake of soap, three bucks a bottle of whisky, 75 bucks, a watch, 200 bucks and a camera, a 1000 bucks. Lasted till over 30 G.I.'s. ...possession of arms or cigarettes. They're Germans, we try them in their own court. Yes, sir. What's new on the run, Sergeant? - See the polizeiget this. - Yes, sir. - Eric. - Yes, Herr captain. He's escaped. Am I discharged? What would you do if you were in my place? I would discharge me, Herr captain. He might try to contact you. - What's that? - That's possible. Would you turn him in? Would I protect a man who put my mother in a concentration camp? And laughed when she died a raving maniac? Herr captain? Have I your permission to follow through with this? Okay. Done. My beloved father. The great S.S. colonel Heiden. He murdered my sister's husband because of some non-Aryan strain. He placed my sister on a Hitler farm to bear children with strangers for the glory of the Third Reich. He murdered 71 American prisoners at Malmedy. He had such a magnificent record that Himmler picked him to organize the Werewolf. Werewolf? I've heard that somewhere before. What is that, Eric? It's an army. A secret army founded by Himmler to carry on the war after Germany's defeat. An army of fearless delinquents. Carry on a war with what? Your people are having enough trouble finding enough to eat and a place to live. Everywhere Werewolf is fanatic, David. They will find weapons. Like the Nazi party did. I don't think you should lose any sleep over it, Eric. We've got over a million armed G.I.'s in Germany. 'It'll be tough to find a German stupid enough' 'to join up with Hitler's pipe dream.' Three more recruits. Good. Where is it? - Where is what? - The food! Help yourself. Take one. He said take one. With 20 cigarettes, you can get a woman. For 2000 cigarettes, a man will.. ...smuggle wanted Nazis out of the country. That is gold you are smoking. Do not forget it. I'm Bruno Eckart. What is your name? Helmuth Strasser. Helmuth Strasser. Cigarettes, clothing, jewelry, food. Anything we can lay our hands on goes to help escaped war criminals. War criminals. All those Americans have me calling them that. That's oughta all be hung in Nuremberg. They left us in the lurch. - What did you say? - I'm interested in my skin. This is good. But our main objective is not only to save their lives. Now, you're talking. The job of the Werewolf is to kill Americans until everyone is driven out of Germany. It's too late for Siegfried to kill the dragon, Bruno. 'I'm not interested in rescuing' 'them under American guns. Are you a Nazi? Yeah. I'm a hungry, disillusioned, angry Nazi who knows when he's beaten. Then you should be angry enough to fight. I'm angry enough to have two wounds. The Iron Cross, first class, to infantry of Salt Metal and the hand to hand fighting class. I know what war is and I'm sick of it. We all are. I didn't come here to join an army of beer mug pushers and sausage soldiers. I thought I was joining a band of black marketers to steal so I could get food in my belly. That's what we'll do. So why this talk about fighting with the Americans? With what? How? Hitler's system was a good idea badly carried out. If he failed, what do you expect to do with these sausage kids? You once told me, Bruno Eckart was a smart organizer. Smart? You're stupid. This whole idea is stupid. Is it stupid for me to be a Polizei working with the American Military Government? Is it stupid.. ...knowing how desperate they for mine sappers? For me to maneuver the American captain to clear Gunther? That's fine. Take advantage of your position, fill our bellies and forget all this familiar nonsense about fighting. You know, your, your pack of cops here isn't big enough to frighten one American patrol. In 1919, Hitler was only one man. In 1920, 64 men. In 1942, he almost ruled the world. And he started as a pack.. ...that became S.S. And look at us now. Grow up, Bruno. The plan is to start small. The way he did. First with a squad. Then a strong troupe. 'Then a brigade.' 'And then an army.' How do you expect to do this with the enemy in our hair, 24 hours a day? 'The way Hitler did.' 'We'll attract a 100.' 'The jobless, the gutless, the-the vermin, the angry ones.' Uh, but Hitler didn't have a million armed American soldiers in his lap when he started. But if enough Americans are killed.. ...their families will make Washington pull out the army of occupation. 'This is the American Forces Network.' 'American zone, Germany.' 'Continued widespread suppressive activities' 'of well organized bands of guerillas have increased' 'the determination of the military government' 'to crush the Werewolf.' 'Particularly the area between Nuremberg and Munich.' 'These fanatics who rob the countryside in search of loot' 'have even established help posts to warn them' 'of the approach of the American patrol.' 'While the army of occupation' 'supervised wide scale transportation' 'of this misplaced persons' 'the Werewolf created the dissension in ranks.' 'Their destruction of military supplies and installations' 'have caused panic among Germans.' 'Quantities of supplies have been stolen.' 'Petrol dumps blown up. American soldiers have been murdered.' 'Several German police have been attacked.' 'Black market value on food, cigarettes' 'gasoline and blankets has gone up.' Total value of violence during the past month has amounted to one percent of the stocks. What's goin' on here? Yeah, give me your hand. But last night's hijack was food for the local Germans. No, sir, they're all out. The Burgermeister too. - Sir, is that Captain Harvey? - No. What happened? Another demonstration. Looks like another food riot, sir. Can you contact one of the other patrols? Right, sir. This is an important year. The year one of occupation of Germany. It must become the year one of driving the armies, out of Germany! We let these Americans run our lives whenever they felt. They promise us democracy. Democracy on empty stomachs? Germans. Germans are fighting over garbage dumps. There's no hope for us unless we run our own government. The army don't want us to live again. They want us to die a slow and permanent death. Where is our food, Herr Brent? You eat every day. Your family eats every day. But what about us? Wait a minute. Wait. There's food coming from Munich. Promises. Always promises. Don't blame the Americans if you're hungry. Your own people took the food out of your mouths. 'Why don't you demonstrate against the Werewolf?' Why don't you let us rule ourselves? Go home, army. We don't any liberators. Liberators? We're not here as liberators. Now, you get that straight. All of you. We're here as conquerors and don't you forget it. We could've pulled a Nazi job after we won. And mistreated you like you mistreated everyone else. No food, no medicine, no clothes. Nothing! 'We could've set up a Nazi state. But we didn't.' Instead, the United States is spending a hundreds of millions of dollars feeding Germans. Ah, money! Always talk of how much money you're spending on us. But you're not turning any of it down, are you? You call it dirty capitalistic money but you're taking every penny of it. Instead of treating you like animals we give you a blood transfusion. If your stomachs are empty, it's because dirty Nazi rebel rousers are trying to work up another Hitler on your hands! Now, break it up! Move out! Go to hell, you dirty Americana! Your people will condemn all of us. Because of the Werewolf soon, all of us will be... Nazis to the Americans. We know the middle-aged and elderly are not giving us the trouble here, Burgermeister. The Hitlerjugend. The Hitlerjugend is behind every single act of violence. In my country they're called juvenile delinquents. The same disease all over the world. Without families, or from broken ones they travel in wolf packs, operate like gangs. Individually, they're all chicken inside. Frightened little cowards who attack at night. But get one of them alone... they run like a rat. Captain, with your permission we middle-aged and elderly ones would like to form a group. It will be like your American policy. We could police there.. We're all for it. The more you can get in. The better we like it. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, for your faith in us. Good day. How's your head? Well, I, I feel a lot better than I look. Helga, she blew her stack today, when I came to work. Captain, if you don't mind I will knock off. I'll finish these graphs tomorrow. Wait a minute, David. I, I hate to lower the boom at a time like this. But, it's an order. I'm chopped? Well, I, knew when I clobbered that soapbox meathead that I just stepped on the armies toes. No, it's not only that. As soon as you assume military authority you started a riot. But I covered you on that. Then, why am I fired? Temporary. You're suspended. Till the whole case is investigated. How long do you think I'll be outta work? I don't know. Maybe weeks, maybe months. But, if you come out clean, you'll get all your back pay. It looks to me like the army's favoring the crowds over me. No, no, no. The Army is bending way back not to give the Werewolf anything else to throw at hungry Germans. Hungry people are easier to bamboozle. You think giving me the axe is gonna stop the riotin'? It's not what I think. The army is dropping all civilians in the zone and replacing them with Germans. That'll give the subversives less ammunition to cause trouble. I never thought I'd be fired for a German. You should consider yourself lucky you came out of it the way you did. If Bruno hadn't blocked those blows you'd have been kicked to death. Yeah, I know, Captain. But what happens to me now? Well... if you haven't got fare back home, I'll stake you. You mean, pull out? A hungry American in the German bread lines won't help the situation. But I'll get a job. I'm... Well, the Germans can't even find one. - No German will hire you. - But I've got a wife here. That's why it's better to send the money from the states. She is pregnant. Look, captain. I am sticking until I get an okay to take my wife and baby back to America. Holy smoke. This is no time to be talkin' about leavin'. No ex-G.I. in my command is gonna sweat on a food permit. Well, it's not verboten for an American civilian to live here, is it? Now, you answer me. Yes or no. Am I under military supervision right now? - Everybody is. - Nobody makes me leave my wife. Nobody. As long as I keep my nose clean I don't want anybody butting into my life. I'm not askin' any favors from the army. Now, just lay off me. 'David. David!' I'm sorry, David. - See if I can help? - I'll manage. I hate to see such a good fellow like you make a mistake. Mistake? She is not David. You talk like you got kicked in the head. - You're a good fellow. - Yeah, well, you said that. It is stupid for you to give up your country for a, for a woman like Helga. What did you say? It is of the job, David. She will want no part of you. She told me. She would have lived with any American. But as long as you were stupid enough to want it legal she married you. She only married you for food, David. Can't you see she's like all the other Nazi frauleins? Ask her why she calls you her American gold mine. David? - David? - 'Hey.' Oh, I'm sorry. You should not have gone to work today. You need that rest. Won't you sit down. Sit. Put on some of this?? like your boric acid. It'll make you feel much better. Oh, David, I.. I'm just so frightened. If this happened in front of the MG office just think what will happen next. - Oh! - I'm sorry. I don't think they'll bother me anymore. - You found them? - No. Haven't found them yet. My mother saw this happen after the last war. One push will follow another. Well, I'm gonna watch this one from the sideline. I do not understand. Well, tomorrow, I'm gonna get my food permit from the captain. Food permit? Oh, why should you need a food permit? 'Cause I was fired. It's only temporary. But a German is gonna hold down my job. Ain't that a switch? There's plenty of work. I can repair bridges or roads. I'll get a job even on the bucket brigade. An American in a bucket brigade? What's the difference? It's a job. There must be something captain Harvey can find for you. Uh-Uh. No. Me and the army are officially kaput. - They want me to go home. - Where will the food come from? I said I'll get a permit and stamps. We cannot exist on such rations. - I know, but... - Germans won't give you work. Not with so many of us jobless. Not even on the bucket brigade. Why are you getting so upset? I'm not the first guy to be fired. You are the first American to be fired in Germany. There's no place here for a foreigner without work. Helga, you talk like you want me to go home. I don't care what I sound like. I'm telling what is facing you. Just sit down here a second. Let's get one thing straight. You mean with a baby coming you don't care if I go back to America? At least there, you can find work. You can take care of us until it is permitted to send for us. David, you will starve here. You mean we'll starve. Isn't that what you're driving at? - I'm no good. I've got no job. - What are you saying? I'm no use to you anymore. That's what I'm saying. Get rid of me. Get a German with a job. - That's what I'm saying. - David! Why did you marry me? What is the matter with you? Why are you talking like this? What I say is for your own health. Your own pride. Did you ever call me "American Goldmine?" Did you? Why did you marry me, Helga? I love you. You never told me that. Since I asked you to marry me, you never told me. You want words? Want to hear it? I love you. I love you. Is that what you want? Oh, David. My feelings for you are much bigger than it was. - I'm so filled with love... - I was a meal ticket to you. Nein! You'd have lived with any American. Especially one that works in a food office. You were all "What a chance." No wonder you married me. So no other Fraulein could hook me. Deny that! Deny it! You're right, David. You're right. 'But how could I have loved you then? I didn't know you.' Of course, I married you for food. What else could I do? We were afraid and hungry. But that was before, David. I swear it. Now, now it is different. Now, I love you. Now, it's easy to say because it's out in the open. - No! You must believe me! - I don't believe you! I couldn't believe you no matter what you tell me. You know why? Because I'm up to my neck in double crossers in this country. I don't blame you for getting rid of me. - Just another mouth to feed? - Oh, no, David. What kinda animal do you breed here, Helga? How could you live with me, hating me so much? How could you want my baby when.. You're lower than a street walker. At least when they take you know it. Not a dirty Nazi scheme, to make a sucker out of an American. Now, that I'm no longer the feed bag it's, go home David. Send money from America, David. Send for us, David. Well, I don't want any part of you. Oh, I'll see you get chow. I'll become the best pack rat in this town. I'll keep feeding you while you're carrying my baby. But, the minute it's born, I'm gonna take it back to America. My Kid is not growin' up to become a Nazi. Nobody's gonna stop me from taking it. You give birth to my kid. I don't care what happens to you. We should have dropped that bomb right here and wiped out all of you Nazis. Tell them this is the new list of relay points marking the SS out of Germany. Colonel Heiden going to Egypt? The other two generals are going to South America. There will be a truck. Waiting to take colonel Heiden to the farm house. A potato cart has been arranged to relay him to point four. There's a change of clothes for him in that box. As he goes in, give this money. Put this list away. - Franz? - Yeah? The box car is getting too small for meetings. From now on, we will meet behind the bahnhof. Yeah. What is wrong? Did you get the shipment? Yeah. It's already on the black market runnin' Berlin and Frankfurt. You look sick. I am sick. Why didn't you tell her it wasn't a surprise? What's the difference? Bruno, I've... killed.. ...and stolen.. ...and done everything to stir up revolts against armies. But medicine is different. One can go without food for hours but.. ...medicine means life or death in a matter of minutes. I'm not interested in a lecture. But, that medicine was for our own people. Hundreds of sick Germans will die. - Lots of people will die. - But these are Germans! To hell with them. - What did you say? - I said to hell with them! That's the second time I've had to live through that statement. First was Adolf Hitler. And now, it's you. Get me a piece of coal, Franz. The Werewolf alone.. ...have the right to rule Germany. This is a military court martial. And I find you guilty of treason. The enemy is to work for us. And so far as we do not need them, they must die. Hit a bull's eye with the knife, Gunther. 'Their sick. They need medicine. Their sick. They need medicine.' Sick. They need medicine. Sick. They need medicine. - Sick. They need medicine. - Franz. Franz. - What medicine? - It was just a bad dream. Now, what is this about medicine? I told you it was a bad dream. And why haven't you undressed? I found them. Who is the leader of these hoodlums? Who are you to call us hoodlums? By looting, killing, stealing food from our own people and selling it on the black market what would you say? - They're for Hitler. - Oh, Franz. - Germans suffered under Hitler. - That is a lie. The first to be thrown in concentration camps were anti-Nazi Germans. He only put the Jews, the Jews and the pols and all the enemies who started the war against us. He killed German Catholics, German protestants... You're a liar. He killed German Lutherans, German priests, German old men German old women, German cripples German sick, German insane. He's right. You have sold out to the enemy. Who's right? Tell me, Franz. Who told you I sold out? If I prove what the Nazis did, would you believe me? You'll show me nothing but lies. - You afraid? - A Werewolf is never afraid. If I am wrong, I'll help you fight the Americans. You will, you promise? I swear it.

We'll look together. This is something we should see, everyone should see. The whole world should see, Franz. Franz, look. I didn't know. I-I didn't know. I didn't know. Hey, Brent. Oh, I've been looking all over for you. Beat it, kid. Bruno and Wills are meeting behind the bahnhoftonight. What kinda double talk you giving me? Get lost! Believe me. Bruno is the Fuhrer. You must tell Capt. Harvey. You know where he is. You tell him. - She wants you to tell him. - She who? - Helga. - Why is she involved in this? She took me to Nuremburg today. I saw the trials. - She took you to the trials? - Yeah. - You saw Gary? - I saw Gary. I saw film. I didn't know it! I didn't know. What time they meeting behind the bahnhof? I-I-In thirty minutes. You go straight home. I'll meet you there. Hello? That's funny. I came back for the same thing. How did you know I'd need that list for tonight's meeting? G-Gunther sent me for it. That's fine, Franz. Give it to me. I just left Gunther by the bahnhof. Where were you going with that list? I got my job back. Think I should ask army for a raise? You've never seen such action There was action all over the place. Not even in the army. The opposition was just... 'Fire, fire!' Franz!
