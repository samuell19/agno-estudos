Thank you! Mirror, mirror, in this quarter, who is the most beautiful of all? Alena Karlitsova. Mirror, who loves Milan Budil? Alena Karlitsova. TO BUY: Milk, butter, eggs, cheese, ketchup. Girl, where might I find Steyskalovy? I don’t know. In any case, there isn’t anybody here now. Babylon! All the blocks here are the same, and each with so many people… No one knows how to find anyone. - Would you like a water treatment? - You little orangutan! Girl, please get this jam down for me. Thank you. What are you doing here? Don’t you have a vacation? I’ve come back. I was in the south of Bohemia with my grandmother. You were supposed to stay there? for a few more days. My grandmother was ill. I’m also constantly sick with rheumatism, aching bones, cold feet… And you’re, what, here alone? - Yep. Is that you? Is it already half-past nine? I probably have about two hours until I go crazy. 24.10 Aren’t you hot, my mother? Woollen socks, a sweater... No, girl, my feet are freezing! - I wish I could swap with you! You’d get rid of yours? - Yes, of course! I’m listening. Yes, this is Alena Karlitsova. Is that you, Mr. Budil? At the premiere of your film? Of course, I want to be there. You want to go there with me by car? Oh, do cease and desist, Mr. Budil. A few minutes ago you wouldn’t have even noticed me. You love me? I'm terrified! Then you have to behave differently. I know that you’ve been spending time with this Sisovoy, who played a flight attendant! The girls all say the same thing. There’s no need to string me along! Do not call me any more, or I’ll unplug the telephone. This is the end, do you understand? ...in some areas tonight it will be partly cloudy, and the temperature will drop to 16 degrees. Daytime temperatures will be 29 to 34 degrees above zero. There will be a mild southerly, and in Slovakia, a south-easterly wind. In the meantime, let’s enjoy the sunlight for the next few days. - Hello! Something for you. - Thank you! "The sun bakes us from morning until evening, and the sea is the same colour as on the other side of the card. Regards, Kate." "Heavenly Love". Beautiful, isn’t it? Do you know why Adam was kicked out of Eden? Because of Eve. Adam was a decent and generous man. But Eve was a bitch! That’s how this world is – you, too, will become like that. I... do you have…? I didn’t want to… the thing is, that… Damn it! - Hello! - Hi. Mr Duda, when will Zdena be back? Allow me! I'll go with you. You seriously don’t know when Zdena is coming? When the weather worsens. And how is Zdena going? How is she? I think she’s good. Goodbye. Zorro! Zorro, come here! That's right... Zorro, Zorro... - Hello, Mr. Taraba! - Hi, Alenka! - Are you still alone? - Yes. If you’d like, for two days you can have a girlfriend. - I can? Who? - Zorro here. I have to go to the hospital for tests and prepare for surgery. That's perfect! -Hello! -Hello! Who was it? Some soldier. You’re slurping like a pig. Do you think that’s nice to listen to? To me, it’s delicious. And if you weighed 100 kilos, you'd never go hungry. Just wait, that'll be you when you're 30. - Mum, what was Eve guilty of? - What? - Well, in Eden. - She stole an apple. - I heard that she was a bitch. - Who told you that? Some man said it at the supermarket. That’s what men say about every woman. Where are you up to now? Around Krupa. 5 more kilometres and I’ll lose 100 grams! Why did you stop pedalling? Because I’m going downhill, smarty pants! Mummy, are the soldiers also on vacation? I met a neighbour in uniform. Are you talking about Pavel Sukhan? Probably came back for his girlfriend. They should be getting married. Decent man; bitch. - What are you mumbling? - Nothing. Dwarf! Where are your gloves and ear flaps? - Fool! Yes! Alena. You called! But a couple of minutes ago you laughed at me. That's all. Please don’t apologise. Don’t. You see, I was also a little nervous yesterday. You don’t need to say anything, I just wasn’t thinking. It’s probably because of the heat. As in Africa, or on the beach. Is it hot there in the studio? I read somewhere that you’ve filmed some musical? You’re inviting me to the premiere? Well, well, well. I’ll wear that green summer dress that you like. That red-haired boy is a fool, isn’t he? You know, girl, I like it! I don’t like girls who think that all the guys are going crazy about them, while they wear pyjamas and sit on the potty. Go to hell, and go play with your dolls! Go to hell yourself! Get out of our house, you red monkey! Chicken! Upsetting, upsetting carrot-head, the biggest disappointment, carrot-head. Mangy red baboon! - Mr. Taraba. - Yes. One moment. I don’t need it – seriously, I don’t! Do you know how much she eats? - All right then. Zorro, I'll be back soon. Now you have to listen to Alenka. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Oh, don’t forget to let her watch TV in the evenings, or she won’t fall asleep. Okay. Zorro, calm down. Hey, Zorro. Zorro, stop! - How many cutlets do you want? Two. Actually, three. - Three! You’ll eat them? - Don’t worry, I will. - Come to the table then. - Thanks. - Anything interesting? - Not for you. It would be better if you looked at your textbooks – you’re not going to get very far with ‘C’s. And eat! It’s the holidays now, and I'm not a little child, and you can cut hair with ‘C’s! You had two ‘D’s – I found your certificates. You can’t hide! You want to give people haircuts, but your own head looks like a scarecrow’s! Come see me at work tomorrow, and bring it all in order. Mum, I'm going to look in on Zorro – I need to turn the TV on for her. Does Mr. Taraba have a TV? He says he just imagines what’s happening. And Zorro watches every evening. Okay, go. Hi, Zorro! I'll leave the lights on so you won’t be afraid. I have to go now. Mum will be angry. Sleep well, and sweet dreams! I’ll come and see you in the morning. Let's go outside. Oh, a dog! Kamil, Kamil, please get this dog away from me. Go away! Stay where you are. If you don’t move, it won’t touch you. Tell it to stay where it is. Well, do something! Zorro, come here. Good evening! Zdena still hasn’t returned? - No. - And you still don’t know when she’ll come? - When there’s an earthquake. Come on. - Gavlova. Who's there? Who's there? - It’s Private Sukhan. Sorry. - Hello, who's calling? This is Winch. Who's there? - Private Sukhan, sorry. What do you need? Why not call your own apartment number? Hello? - Hello, Clara? Clara, is that you? Clara? - No, Private Sukhan. Private Sukhan? I'll get you, idiot! Alena, is that you? Sukhan. No, thank you, Mrs. Karlitsova. Mr. Sukhan, is Alena anywhere nearby? Have you seen her? You come once a year! Aren’t you ashamed of yourself for being so drunk? - Quiet! - Go look, quickly! - Don’t make a scene, Rudolph! Well, come and have a look at our little boy, and how drunk he is! Rudolph, please control yourself. Hmmph. I can’t control myself. So I can’t control myself! He can’t control himself! He can’t control himself! I will not tolerate it. Get lost! And don’t come back until you sober up. - Oh, what is it now? - Mum, I’m here by myself. Clever, clever Zorro, come to me. It’s important that you don’t let her on the bed. Yesterday I changed the sheets. And if she's hungry, give her burgers. They’re on the stove. What was that noise down there? Private Sukhan was off his chops. - What? “Off his chops”? - Well, drunk. It's yours? Will there be an eclipse? I come here to see whether it’s going to rain. You do not like that the weather is good? When it starts to rain, my friend will come back. You didn’t go anywhere for the holidays? Vacationing in Pisek with my grandmother. And you? - It is said that you’re going to get married? - Where did you get that from? - Just rumours. - Yes, well, one grandmother whispers... - The last one? - Yes. I have to go. Zorro’s waiting for me downstairs. - Who? - A German Shepherd. Thanks. - Oh, hi! What's its name? - Zorro. It’s a girl? - Yes. What is your wish, "Girl Zorro"? Perm or blow-dry? A blue rinse, half a kilo of ham and a scratch behind the ears! Where is my mother? Promise me you’ll wash her hair. - Who’s that, with such a trunk for a nose? - That’s Mr. Gappel, from the car mechanic’s. And what’s he doing here? He comes here for a haircut, a shave, and a haircut and a shave. - Here? - No, not here, the men's salon. Well, it’s roasting. Why don’t you go swimming? - And how often? - What how often? Oh, Mr. Gappel. Enough! His hair doesn’t even have time to grow back. If you want, I can wash your head. Next time. Come on Zorro, let’s go. Don’t say anything to Mum, okay? Is this a guide dog for the blind? What's its name? Zorro, but she’s not on friendly terms with everyone. - Hmm... I’m not either. - How come? Where are your friends? Around the world - in Monte Carlo, Hawaii, Lake Macha, etc. - And I thought they were all criminals. - This town is like that for me… a "Devil's Island"; a punishment for poor grades on one’s report card. - Is that really so delicious? - It’s just an image. Come to the shed. I always smoke a cigarette there before going to bed. - Maybe you’ll start doing it as well. - Mum will break every bone in my body! The same risk! My father once almost killed me, and then treated me! He's my doctor. I also wanted to be a doctor, but, probably will be a hairdresser like my mother. All women are as dumb as logs. For example, if you marry Budil, you’ll have a life without worries, visiting festivals. Who I will marry, I have no idea, but it certainly won’t be a redhead! And who would marry you? Goose herder! Zorro, let's go! Come on, Zorro. Go. Down, Zorro. Don’t be afraid. - Hello. - Hi, Alenka. - You didn’t spoil my girl? - No, we had a great time together! - That's nice to hear! Zorro… - And how are you? Ready for my operation. The daggers are being sharpened! What, you didn’t spend any of this? So then, run along to the store Buy ice cream cake, a bottle of red wine, and some biscuits And more ham for this evening, to celebrate! – Hoorah! - Do not take my wig. - Where are you going? Where else? To the cinema. The food’s been heated and is already cool. Do not know where I put my garnet ring? Who is it? Who are you going with? With Mr. Gappel? Why not if he invited me? How do you know him? - The zoo! - Again with your stories. You’d better tell me where my perfume has gone. - You’re doing your make-up as if you’re going dancing! - You don’t believe we’re going to the movies? - Bring the tickets back then. - You don’t want the ticket from the cloakroom? - Well, do not carry it... - I’ll be home at eleven. I have nothing against you. You're still young and beautiful, Mr. Gappel is handsome! Was he called "Bimbo", by any chance? What is that supposed to mean? I thought that if someone had a trunk for a nose, his name would be "Bimbo". You just wait. I'll deal with you later. Don’t forget to buy mineral water. And go to sleep by 10! Six mineral waters. Came to drink beer? Waiter, one lemonade! Thanks for the pebbles! Where did you collect them? At the construction site – they have sand from the riverbank there. - You’re doing a reading? - Of the past. - The past? - Yes. Here it is. Faithfulness until life’s end. Uniforms. It’s clear. A road, from Poprad to Prague. The bad news? This is him, that dandy – some chauffeur from Koberice. This is her. - Heavenly... - What happened to your hand? Six stitches! It will heal before the wedding. If I got a dwarf now, he’d have grown up before the wedding. Do you have any pictures of yourself? I’m not sure. Bring me some, and sit with me more. - I can’t, I’m going to a party. - What’s it for? - To mark the operation of Mr. Taraba. - Why are you celebrating it? - Because he will be cured of his blindness. - Uh-huh. Go have fun. I sang that for you. Can I try some? - Only half a glass. - You’ll have more? Yes, only a little bit. I have my whole life to drink. I know of a soldier who drinks from a failed love. Don’t worry. You meet a new love and goodbye, alcohol. To your operation! I hope all goes well. I can’t wait to see you. I don’t know what colour your hair is. Well, it’s so-so... not yellow, not brown and not black. Not yellow, not brown, not black or white... So, then, gold or silver like a princess! No. You'll see. It’s just ordinary. I have the same hair colour as your Marushka in the photo. It's late. Put this bottle away somewhere. - Where? - It's all the same. Zorro, come here. Losing 4-0? Who? - "Sparta" - Who do you support? - I'm not interested in football. They’re playing those lumberjack toads again. It’s impossible to even listen to! Leave it there! This music is good to dance to. - Come on, show me. - Okay. - Dancing is better with two people. - I got bad marks in dance. So, now you can fix it. In fact, I got an A for dancing! I could already see you soaring down... - Next time, bring a parachute. - Were you afraid that I was going to fly away? No, I was expecting you to get into a sticky situation. By the way, why did you come up here? I came to see if the lights were on at Martsela’s, in case she’d suddenly come home. - Are they? - No. - And what, is no-one else still here? - Only that red-haired clown. He just smokes and plays in water. In general, they’re not like that. And what’s he still doing here? We used to live near the Sazava River. For us boys, it was a paradise. And here? In Holysov we also lived near the river, but still stoked the stove and boiled the water. When the girls are here, it's so fun! Someday, people will start to leave for Prague. I'll be one of the first. - Well, have you tried those stones yet? - Not yet, tomorrow. 5-0, lumberjacks... - We’ll play together tomorrow, okay? - What time? At ten. And don’t forget to bring a photo! - Hi. - Hi. Do you have a moment? I need to talk to you. - About what? - About what? About us. You won’t invite me in? Hello. Is it going to be some sort of sleeve for a leg? Yesterday, we went to have a coffee. I’ve been going nowhere for the last three years. Continuing on in this cage... you’ll get married, and what’s left for me? There’s nothing sweet about loneliness. You have no friends either. Like a body without a soul. So, this is your dinner? You didn’t buy anything... We’ve been given a bonus. Go buy a new swimsuit. “Bimbo” invited us to go on a vacation to Lake Macha. I’d love to visit the sea... Where are you going, to Bulgaria? We were there last year, not bad! This year we’ll fly to Romania, in May. Well, what do you say? - I had that one last year! - And how much does it cost now? - 110. Here, look how nice this material is. They’re imports – there are only two of them. - How beautiful! How much does it cost? - 130. - And this? - 120. - So, which one? - I'll take this one for 110. - But you already have this? - So what, it’s so beautiful. Of course. - Thank you! Goodbye. - Bye now. - Hi. - Hello. - Why did you not come yesterday? - You were here yesterday? - Of course. - I overslept. - Indeed? I heard your "Lullaby for a cadet". You had that girl over. I did, but it was the last time. - Did you bring the photo? - You seriously want it? - Of course. - Then wait here. Excuse Me. That's perfect! I look very young here, but I don’t have anything more recent. In any case, it’s good. In my last photo as a civilian, I look very different to how I am now. I had hair almost down to my waist! Dad was the most angry about it, because his head is as bald as a knee! Once a postwoman said to me: "Girl..." Then the house was a real rodeo! At the end of your life, will you have long hair again? Probably not... If I can, I’ll grow a moustache. Then I'll grow one too! I knew one woman who had a moustache like the mountain spirit Krakonos! Maybe someday it will be fashionable. - How do I look? - Like a fifty-year-old catfish. We’ll visit Mum, and she’ll show you how to look like a woman with a moustache in the year 2000. - Perhaps in a year’s time. I'm leaving today. - Already? - After dinner. - Will you come with me to the station? - I don’t know. In two hours, I'll come and get you. - Poprad in the Tatra Mountains? I haven’t been there. - I'll send you a postcard. - Do you have a picture of yourself? - No. But I can give you this. - Why? - Maybe it will bring you happiness. - I have also been unsuccessful in love. - He left you? - He was older, much older. Don’t worry! Your fiancee won’t leave you. - You too, don’t worry. - And you too. - And you too. - Hi, Dad! - Hello, Alena! What are you doing here? I thought you were with your grandmother. I’ve come back! And when are you coming to see me? In two weeks, when I get back from vacation. Let's go to the Chuchle Racecourse and look at the horses. - For sure? - Of course. - Bye bye! - So long! - Thanks! You didn’t buy one for yourself? - No. Have a lick then! You know, you can stop speaking so formally to me. I’m not a grandpa! My name is Pavel. Okay. - Very tasty. - Thank you, I can’t. How come? Soldiers only drink green “Peppermint”, to help with their disguise. - Are you deceiving me? - More like “kidding” - Okay, kidding? - Yes I am. Your papers, comrade soldier. From vacation? Where? - Poprad. It's your sister? Your bride? Congratulations! The guys will want to hear about girls, about pubs, about discos, and I’ll tell them How I got acquainted with this dancer, and that every day we had visits on the roof... their eyes are going to fall out! - You’ll still come back? - When I’m already a "grandpa". If you want, let's go together to the pub! - I still won’t be able to drink beer. Then you’ll drink lemonade, and then drive me home! - And go for a swim. - In Holysov. I have a new swimsuit! Better at the Sazava. Bring a fishing rod, and I’ll show you a place where the pike nibble all the time! And I’ll gather up firewood, start a fire and cook the fish... Alena? Alena! Come here, Zorro! - Where did you steal her from? - I’m looking after her. - How come? Mr. Taraba is in hospital. He was taken back to the emergency room at lunchtime. - What happened to him? - In the optometry department, an operation. - On Wednesday we’ll go to see him with Zorro. - I’ll take Zorro home. Nothing doing. I already brought her toothbrush and prepared her bed. - Then tomorrow she’ll sleep with us. - Yeah yeah... It’s starting to rain! Damn. - How long does it take to get to the hospital? - It’s two hours from our house. - Near ours. - Well, near the supermarket. Here you go. - And who’s this soldier? - A neighbour. We just met by chance on the way. - Will you come to the garage this evening? - Why? I don’t smoke. - She needs something cooked for her dinner. - It’s not going to work out. Zorro, come on, let's go. - Why won’t it work out? - Because it’s raining! THE END
