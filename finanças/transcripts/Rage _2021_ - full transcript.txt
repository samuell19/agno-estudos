What time is it? Early. I don't feel well. What are you doing? What's that? It's six in the morning, can't this wait til the weekend? I was up. Should I put on some coffee then? Sure. I'll finish it later, thanks. Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. So I was thinking, maybe I could cook dinner for us tonight. Well, what's the occasion? I don't know, I kinda feel like I haven't seen you all week and, it'll be nice. Sounds good. So you'll be here? Of course. Jesus babe, can you wait til I'm done? Seriously? How you squeeze the fucking toothpaste. What? You always squeeze it from the top, I've said from the bottom. Okay. Love you. She gets home around six. What about him? Late. Squeeze from the bottom, fucking unbelievable. I've never done this before. It's easy. It was a nine L drive, it was amazing. You must go. That's great. Thanks for calling Riley Dental, this is Madeline speaking. How can I help you? Hello? Hey there. Oh, I didn't startle you did I? No, I was just, um, how can I help you? I've got an appointment with Dr. Riley. 11 o'clock? Yeah. All right, if you can just fill this one out for me. - Mmhmm. - And he'll be right with you. None of your business. Signed, okay. Thank you. You just want to take a seat over there. Sure. You know, it's a long story. A lot of people say I got the kind of face that you just wanna punch. Course my line of work doesn't really help. What's your line of work? I'm just your typical private investigator. So this husband suspected his wife was cheating on him, he hired me to look into it, and what do you know? He was right. She was none to happy about getting caught out. She's got a mean right hook, I'll give her that. Pretty good left one too. What about you? Um, well, I work at a dental surgery. I mean I couldn't help but notice you got a ring wrapped around your finger. I, yep, married. Happily? Sorry. Yes? Hello? Dr. Riley will see you now, just head right down the hall. Thanks. Um, Randy Cooke, because you never know who you can trust. Hmm? Okay. Oh yeah. Hey, here she goes. For the love of music. You've reached Rebecca, leave a message. Hey, it's your sister. Can you please call me? Fuck. Hey. Let me guess, he's stuck at work again? I have picked up the cheapest wine I can find and it's not gonna drink itself. All right Mads, see you in a bit. So you really think he's cheating on you? Don't know, it sure feels like it. Did you ask him? No. Hey, can you please not do that in here? All right, aren't you the life of the party? And you haven't even touched your wine. It's an expensive rug and you were gonna ash all over it. Oh, it's an expensive rug and you're gonna ash all over it. Wow you're an asshole. Oh come on. I'm not the one sitting here wallowing in my sorrows. If you think he's sleeping around why don't you just fucking ask him? How hard is that? What, you think he'll just admit to it? Well, it's called communication, you should try it sometime. When was the last time you guys had sex? So it's been a while. I'm not discussing that with you. Well you never wanna talk about it and I really think you should. I like romance. Waking up in the middle of the night to a hard on is not gonna put me in the mood. Well, at least you get that. Do you still love him? Yes, I do, but sometimes he just, oh, I. Well, Mads if that isn't true love then I don't know what is. There's some more on the counter. Oh shit, what time is it? Why? I've gotta go. Little early isn't it? I'm supposed to be home for dinner. Home to your wife. Yes, home to my wife. It's funny how quickly your tone changes once you've blown your load. Can we not do this? Do what, talk? Precisely. I can cook too. Maybe some other time. You said you weren't happy. Right? Mmhmm. Right? Mmhmm. So just leave her. It's not that simple. It is if you let it be. I wasn't happy with my boyfriend so I left him. It's not that simple when you're married. And what would be simple for you? Hmm? If she fell down a flight of stairs, if the brakes in her car stopped working? It was a joke. I didn't find that funny. Anyway look, I've gotta go cause I'm gonna be late. Fine. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Okay, okay, I've gotta go. Just make sure you lock up on the way out, 'kay? Hey Mads, it's getting a little lonely out here. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I think I'm gonna jump in the shower. Okay, well, I'm just gonna go home then. Talk tomorrow? Great chat. Noah? Noah, she's pissed. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Shit, you fucking bitch! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go, let me go! Oh, shit. Wash it. It wasn't fair. Hey man, what the fuck! Come on, this wasn't what we agreed to! Christ this isn't fair! Hey man what the fuck! Fuck this isn't fair! I found her! Fuck! Just not fair. It's not fair! Fucking. Nobody was supposed to get hurt. Easy. All I wanted to do was watch him. All I wanted to do was watch him. Okay. I saw her first. And she smiled at me and it was so fucking beautiful. And I just, I just wanted to see what it was like. I understand. I wasn't gonna touch her. Okay, where's my wife? Please, you don't have to do this. Where's my fucking wife? Maddie. Maddie! Maddie open up! Maddie are you okay? Maddie it's me. It's just not your day, is it? Are you all right, you all right mate? Where's my wife? I don't know man. Where the fuck is my wife? Maddie! Maddie! Maddie! Do you remember anything? Do you remember your name? It's ah, it's Noah, Noah Tate. You were shot. Once in the shoulder, once in the chest and once in the head. One of your eardrums was blown out so you'll probably experience some loss of hearing. Now we had to preform emergency surgery to remove the bullet from your head. With serious head injuries such as yours lingering side effects are expected. There's a risk of seizures, short term and long term memory loss, and migraines, like the one you're having now. There you go, that good. Shhh. Go on get that in, get that in. It's okay. Go on. How long have I been here? You've been a coma for 39 days mate. Where's my wife? It's just not your day, is it? Get your gun out. Move in. Covering the stairs. Broderick three oh three. There is a body on the floor on the second level, we need AVA asap but we'll keep clearing the house. Go, go upstairs. Stand by one moment star 22 22. It was a dark colored sedan. You know I saw it a few times but didn't really think anything of it. And you didn't happen to look at anyone at all or? No, I just thought it was a visitor come to see a friend. Okay. There was a second intruder, by the time we arrived he was gone. Did our witness provide us with a description? Ah, no, she was a little shaken. Ah, so we believe the husband came in after the initial break in. How's he doing? Hanging in there, barely. There are no signs of robbery. If the shit bags did take anything they sure as fuck put everything back together nice and fucking neat. Language officer Wells, language. I thought you were taking time off? I did. So if they didn't come here to rob the place, what did they come here for? Sure there were only two of them? Well, she nodded when I asked but like I said, she was out of it. They break in while she's in the shower, not expecting anyone else to be here. Sister catches them by surprise, she fights back, maybe hurts one of them. He shoots her in the head, problem solved. They then turn their attention to the bathroom to complete whatever it is they came here to do. Husband gets home, one of the assailants checks it out, gets stopped in his tracks. Husband then tries getting back into the bathroom where the second assailant has his wife. The dirt bag starts blasting through the door, wings him. Comes out to finish the job, while he's doing that she makes her escape and our assailant vanishes into the night. And she wasn't able to provide us with any description at all? No. I assume he'd be wearing a mask like his friend though. Which hospital did they take her to? Hi Madeline, I'm Dr. Whitmore. Now, I'm just going to ask you a couple of questions. Is that okay? Okay. Have you had any other sexual activity in the last 72 hours? Are you? With your permission, we need to run a few tests. The results of these tests could be very helpful in finding out who did this to you. Now, I just need you to sign here and we'll get started right away. Thank you. The man who assaulted her used a condom. She told you that? Mmhmm. Did she say anything else? She's not much for words right now. Would you mind if I had a few moments with her? Dr. Whitmore, we're Madeline's parents. We've brought her some clothes. I'll catch her at a better time. She hasn't spoken, not a word. Not even to us. Look, the man who did this is, obviously, still out there and we need to find him before he does this again. Now, anything she can tell me, even the tiniest little detail, could be very helpful in finding him. I just need a few minutes with her. Hey Madeline, my name's detective John Bennett and I'm here to help find the man who murdered your sister but I need your help. Was he wearing a mask, like his partner? At any time during the attack, did you happen to get a look at his face? Our time's up. Maybe I'll see you again next week. I've sent you the security footage link, you might wanna check it out. Great, thanks. Randy. Do you know anyone who might have had a reason to harm Noah or his wife? Former co-workers, disgruntled employees? No, not that I know of. What was your relationship with him like? Fine, I guess. We work together. I understand you and Noah are usually the last to leave. Do you remember what time he'd left on the night of June 14th? I don't know, I usually leave before him. What time did you leave? The office closes at seven so, I don't know, 7:30? Do you guys have any security camera footage I could look at? No, it's just the alarm system. Okay, thanks. Yeah. Hi there Patricia I just sent some footage to you. Can you check if there's a timestamp on it for me? Somebodies lying. Run that rego for me too please. Yeah, no worries. Yeah? I'll be right there. The vehicle was reported stolen on June the third. I'm willing to bet this is the car we've been looking for. Apart from that we've got fuck all, they cleaned the shit out of it. Well at least you told me and for Pete's sake language. No documents or registration, nothing in the glove box? There's fuck all there. There's nothing there. Hi, I'm Randy Cooke of Cooke's Private Investigation Services. Yeah, at Cooke's Private Investigation Services supplies services from Melbourne and beyond. And our services include surveillance. Have you spoken to him since? Just the sound of his voice makes me nauseous. Is everything okay? You've been distant lately. I just can't have this end up like the last time. You wanna talk about it? No, I'm fine. Better things to talk about over dinner. Madeline, would it help to write it down? You know, I understand what you're going through, I've been through it myself and I know how painful the memories can be. So I get it if you don't feel comfortable talking about it but we can talk about other things, anything. I'll tell you what, if you don't feel comfortable talking here, you can reach out to me whenever you do feel like talking okay? Whenever you do feel comfortable and, like I said, it can be about anything okay? I'm always around. Labs finally unlocked the phone. Here you go. Great, thank you. You told me you left before him on that night. I usually do. Well you didn't on the night of June 14th. We have tape of you leaving after Noah. There's text messages on his phone from you with pictures, pictures that suggest you and he were more than just co-workers. Did you know he was married? Look I'm not here to shame you. It's not like you held a gun to his head but this is a homicide case we're working on, this is serious stuff. So why would you lie to me? I have footage dating back months, the fact is you don't usually leave before him so you lied to me about that. You and he leave together, usually late. But on the night of June 14th, he left before you, earlier than usual. Look, you're gonna have to start telling me the truth because I'm going to find out, that's what I do for a living, I find things out. Did you have anything to do with what happened to his wife and sister-in-law on the night of June 14th? No, absolutely not. Then why lie to me? Does your wife know you're smoking again? Don't worry, I'm not going to say anything. Thanks. You know, the longer this thing goes on the more and more it goes nowhere. Well, did you get anything on that Anthony Bridgewater character? It certainly doesn't help that he's dead. The kid doesn't even have a rap sheet. Bit of a drifter, moved around a lot, no real friends, family. Even his co-workers at the post office said he barely spoke to anybody outside of hello and goodbye. No incriminating phone calls or texts other than a few payphones in the area. His browser history is just a bunch of porn sites. All we know is he delivered a package to their house once, which she signed for. No connections or affiliations with any other repeat offenders. Squeaky clean record, even his driving record is spotless. Did you get my message the other day about the number plate you had me run? No, what'd you get? Well the vehicle belongs to a guy by the name of Randy Cooke, so I did a check on him and it turns out he used to be a Melbourne PD. Maddie, Maddie? There's a man here who says he knows you. I'm sorry. Now look, I think I might know who attacked you and your sister. I'm not sure if you got a good glimpse of his face or not. Can you tell me, ah, but do you recognize this man? Well, if it isn't Dudley Do-Right and Benedict fucking Arnold eh? 10 82? You know what? Maybe you should spend less time blowing your salary on cocaine and hookers, maybe get a library membership eh? I was wondering when you boys'd drop by and say hi. It's a long time no see. What were you doing outside of Tate Realty on the night of June 14th? Hmm, well I suppose you've also seen surveillance video of me at Riley Dental huh? I was getting my chompers fixed. Hmm? Gave my business card to the little lady and, well golly gosh, she wanted to do business. What kind of business? Come on John, you know what I do now. She had suspicions about her husband that she wanted me to investigate. So investigate I did. Mm, you check her financial records, you'll find a Paypal transaction detailing it. What were you doing at the hospital that night? And what the fuck were you doing following me around? See now, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Bull fucking shit. Karma's a bitch isn't it you rat fuck? Come on step up, come on, come on! What the fuck is that supposed to mean huh? Step it up! You fucking snake! Why don't we, why don't we. What else did you see that night Randy? That night? No you see I just got the information I needed and I went home. I swear to Christ if you're withholding any information on my investigation. I'd tell you John, if I did have any information, well come on, you'd be the first person I'd call. Mmm, by the way how's my office treating you? Are you enjoying the Keurig, hmm? Anyway, good luck with the investigation boys. Hope you get your man. Oh, this time. What were you talking about back there? What? You said he was following you. I could have sworn I saw him. I know I'm pretty sure I did. Why would he be following you? Fucked if I know, sour grapes? Hello? I saw his face. Madeline? Who was that? It was just a patient. Oh give it a rest will you Davidson. What do you care if I smoke or not? You're lighting it the wrong end. Well, that a girl. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. You don't look fine. A few years back, before you joined the force, I was working on a case just like this. This abomination of a human being was kidnapping young girls, torturing them, murdering them. I had a suspect I was 100% certain about, I mean sometimes you just know, I felt it in my gut, I just needed the right evidence. While I'm investigating him my partner had other ideas. Randy Cooke. He had a guy he liked, brought him in for questioning, next thing you know he's doing time for the murders. Everything just fell together perfectly, but too perfectly I thought. But the evidence was there. He's in prison, the murders kept happening, so I looked into it further, turns out Randy had a grudge over the guy, tried putting him away for years without success, some scumbag drug dealer. Anyway, we get to find out, Randy planted evidence with the help of another officer. Randy gets kicked off the force, drug dealer walks free, meanwhile, the real killer is still out there kidnapping young girls. Well did you ever find him? It was my guy all along. He was dead when we found him, natural causes. He was lying comfortably in his king sized bed, a free man, with the bodies of two teenage girls lying rotting in his basement. Detective Bennett, Noah's waking up. What happened? Noah Tate just woke up. Hello? Ted, it's me. I'm really sorry about what happened with Rebecca. Is Maddie there? It's Noah. Maddie? The man who shot you, did you happen to get a look at his face? No, he was wearing a mask. Did he say anything to you? Yeah. It just isn't your day, is it? Why? Well any description of the suspect, even his voice, could really help with our investigation. What did he sound like? Did he have a low voice, gravely, high pitched? Wait, what do you mean description? You still haven't found them yet have you? We're doing everything we can. It's been over a month. Up until now the only witness we've had is your wife, she won't talk. According to her parents she hardly talks to them either. Have you spoken to her? I've tried. I think this whole thing was premeditated, I think these two planned it out all along, following you, watching you. When you eat, when you sleep, everything about your daily routine. I think they knew the exact time you two would be there that night. The one thing they didn't plan on was you coming home early. Tell me about your relationship with Sophia Ogden. We work together. I know that but what was your relationship like? Friendly. Define friendly for me. Fuck. Does my wife know? Maybe, maybe not, I don't know for sure. But it's something you'll probably have to talk to her about at some point, just sayin'. Do you think she had something to do with this? I kinda doubt it. But it's important we consider every possibility. I still don't understand how you don't have any leads. I mean, this is your job isn't it? To find these fucking animals. It's been over a month and you have nothing! Look, I wanna catch this guy just as much as you but I need all the help I can get before someone else gets hurt. Your wife may very well be our best shot at finding him but the longer she doesn't talk the longer he's out there. Now if anyone can get her to talk it's you. After all, you are her husband. Hi Barbara. Where is she? In her room. All day she'll just sit there staring out the window. Did you tell her I was coming? I told her you... She knows. Can I see her? I'm not so sure if that's a good idea right now. Why? After you woke up, we tried bringing her to the hospital to see you but she didn't wanna come. And when we told her you were coming by today she just ran off into her room and locked the door. Why? I don't know. She won't talk to anyone, not even us. She wakes up screaming and sometimes, she sleeps walks. A few weeks ago we found her almost a kilometer away in the middle of the night. She was pregnant Noah, two months. She had a miscarriage. Maddie, babe. It's me. Babe. I've missed you. She looked at me like I was a monster. Like she didn't know who I was. It's not just you, it's everybody. What's going on with you John? It's just work stuff hon. This case has been running me dry. Over a month now and I have nothing. And the one person who might be able to break this thing open won't talk. I know she knows something, I can feel it in my gut, she won't say anything. What happened to her? You don't need to know hon. Horrible things happened to her. Why won't she talk to me? Well trauma, you know, it affects everyone differently and some people do just simply shut down. It can feel overwhelming having to relive the experience, let alone trying to find the words to describe it. And a month really isn't a long time. Whatever she went through, she's still going through it, it's still fresh in her mind. And so distancing herself from anything that reminds her of what happened is the only way she knows how to cope. At least for now. But Elizabeth if she... Honey, do you remember when we first met? I was climbing the walls with anxiety, the slightest noise would just send my heart racing and memories would just float through my mind, images and smells, feelings. And I was loaded with so much shame and guilt that some how I deserved it. Which is, sadly, very, very common. But you're a good man John and I felt that, and so I felt safe to open up to you and she will feel that from you too. I just hope she's getting the help that she needs. But you give her time. And a long boy. Can I get you guys anything else? You're all good? No? Okay cool, enjoy. Welcome to Mel's my name is Soph... Back at this dump eh? It's not so bad. If getting harassed by cops is your cup of tea. Why'd you quit the office? Did it cause I had too. You're back with him aren't you? How's your wife? Don't mention her again. I never made you do anything you didn't want to. Do you remember what you said to me that night, about hurting her? This isn't my fault. No, it isn't. I didn't make you fuck me. You made that decision. I loved you and you made me think that you loved me too. What are you talking about? I didn't make you feel anything. You're the one that made this into something more than it was, not me. Why are you acting like I'm responsible? Are you? What is that supposed to mean? You wanted to keep me longer at that office that night. Why? This is ridiculous. Why? When I heard what happened, I blamed myself. I thought, maybe if you were home, none of it would have happened. But I never made you stay, I never made you do anything and for you to even think that I had something to do with it, it breaks my fucking heart. All I ever wanted was to be with you, since the first time I saw you. And even when you were in hospital I thought, maybe there's a chance we'll be together but I knew I was being selfish and I knew I needed to move on. Not just for myself but for you too. Does she know? I don't think so. She needs you Noah, and I think you need her too. Listen to me, guilt is a hell of a thing, it'll drive you crazy. The only reason I moved on was because I knew that guilt would never go away. Take care of yourself. Okay. All right. We'll have to works something out. Yeah, things are all right, mmhmm. Um hey, can I give you a call back? Yeah, yeah, something that just came up. All right, all right, thank you, bye. Hey. How you doing? I'm okay. - Yeah? - Can we have a chat? Yeah, of course, of course. You've done a really good job here Frank. Oh, thanks mate. I appreciate it. I heard they're still looking for um, one of the guys who did this to you. That's gotta be pretty nerve wracking huh? That's what I wanted to talk to you about, I need your help. Yeah, anything. Do you remember when your apartment got robbed last year? We went out for drinks and bumped into your cousin. Are you talking about Lester? Lester, yeah. Do you still talk to him? I try not to. He's kind of a bad apple. Why? He mentioned about giving you something, something for protection. Fuck Noah. You don't wanna go down that path. Resting her arms along the back of the bench, she drifted into a wistful contemplation of the splendors spread before her by the bright summer day. A flame of blossoms following the curvy mollusks. Butterflies drifted from border to border, as though the flowers themselves arose from their stems. I wonder what happened to him. He simply couldn't adapt himself or what was expected from him. He withdrew from outside contacts. He withdrew. Why won't you talk to me? You won't even look at me. I don't know where we went wrong Maddie. Something happened to us along the way. We used to talk to each other. We used to look at each other. We used to laugh. Talk to me Maddie, please. If ever there was a time to talk to me, it would be now, when we need each other the most. I was at the river front the other day, you know, where I proposed to you. That was a good day. We had a lot of good days. I love you Maddie, I loved you then and I love you now. I just want things to be the way they were. Me too. Maddie! Maddie! What did you say to her to set her off like that? Things that are between a husband and wife. I think I know where she is. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I haven't been a great husband. I haven't been a great anything to anyone lately. But I'm trying. I should have been there. I should have always been there. But I wasn't, because I was selfish. There are some things I need to tell you. But I don't know how. Oh, I can't believe this is happening to us. You didn't deserve this. I don't deserve you. But if you give me a chance I know I can be the husband that you need. Please. Don't leave. I won't ever leave you again. I've been thinking. About? It's been a while since we've had a date night, so I thought maybe a movie or dinner would be good, or maybe a game of darts down at the pub. Or we could watch footie in bed with a pizza. Let's get your mind off this case like just for one night. I think that is a great idea. Yeah? It's good to get out of the house isn't it? Yeah, and they have great coffee here. Hi, thanks. Thank you. Can I get you guys anything else right now? I think we're good for now. It's so good to have my appetite back. I think I'm gonna get a burger. Hi guys, what can I get you? I'll grab the pancakes and some waffles. Hey sweetness. Oh, what are you doing? What? She's not here. Who says I come to see her? Think I'll get a burger. Actually no, the schnitzel. Yeah, definitely the schnitzel. What do you feel like babe? Maddie? Maddie what's wrong? What's wrong babe? That's him. Are you sure? Yeah. Noah please. Can we please leave, please? Okay, all right, we'll go. Maddie, hey, breathe. Don't touch me. Just breathe. Are you 100% sure that was him? Yeah. It was a cop? No wonder they haven't found anything. For all we know, they're covering it up. I feel sick. Oh my head. There's some asprin in the glove box. Why do you have that? For protection. Look, we can't trust anyone, we can't even trust the police. Are you sure you've never seen him before this night? Look, maybe a speeding ticket, even a patient? No, no, I've never seen him before. Thomas Wells. What? That's what his ID said, Thomas Wells. Does that name sound familiar? No. You saw his face, didn't you? John, this case you're working on. I thought we weren't discussing work tonight? The woman, I know her, Madeline Tate. Yeah, she was a patient. She came to about five appointments, didn't say a word. And just stopped coming. And then one night she called me. What did she say? Madeline, Noah, have you got a few minutes? Thank you. Thanks Barbara. Where's Madeline? She's tired. Be nice if she could join us. It's been a long day. Yes it has, yes it has. So, were you just in the neighborhood or is there a reason why you popped past? There was another incident in Geelong, home invasion. The attacker was wearing a Halloween mask. Noah there are a lot of similarities to your case. I really need Madeline in this discussion. I told you, she's tired. Madeline. What are you doing? Madeline. Do you have any idea what she's been through? She doesn't feel like talking. I understand that Noah but she's still a key witness in this case. You've had more than enough time and information to find this guy okay? She doesn't know anything. And how do you know that? Did she tell you that? She saw his face didn't she? I think we're done here. She saw his face, you know it and I know it. And how would you know that? Of Cooke's Private Investigation Services. And at Cooke's Private Investigation Services supplies services from Melbourne and beyond. And our services include surveillance, drag it out, back ground checks, missing persons... Hi, is this Randy? The victim was able to fight back and remove his mask. Only suffered minor injuries. Did she see his face? No, he fled the scene before she could get a look. A neighbor caught a glance though. His description wasn't state of the art. But hey, it's a description none the less. You've run tests on the mask for skin cells, saliva? Yeah, the first thing we did. We should have them back in a few days. If you're having trouble with a cop, why don't you go to the police? I can't, don't trust them. Officer Tommy Wells eh? Tell you why, unsavory type if ever you saw one. He definitely shouldn't be a cop. Definitely not. Mind you the entire department is crooked enough to be hiding behind a corkscrew. That's why I came to you. Of course. Let's have a look here. All right. There's that. Right, he's had a number of suspensions over the years. Failed drug tests, ah, and then he was put on charges for domestic violence which were later dropped. Oh, accused of sexual harassment, at a traffic stop. And then of course there's the ah, police integrity investigation regarding a certain, well a certain case where he aided a superior in the planting of evidence. Oh yeah, and then there is, there's this. What? Well, you know, it's kind of peculiar but could just be a coincidence, you see our Tommy's been in an on again, off again relationship with a girlfriend for the last couple years. In fact, they were even engaged to be married at one point. Tell me does the name Sophia Ogden ring any bells with you? I mean after all, it says here she used to work for you. Well, so anyway, last September she threatens to leave him, yeah, and then our poor Tommy boy is hospitalized, well, due to a half hearted attempt at suicide. And then of course there's the leave of absence from work, extended leave at that. Yeah, he really didn't take it too well did he? But I hear they're trying to, you know, work things out. You understand Noah I'm not trying to imply anything here, I just, find it kinda funny. Don't you? Yeah another late night at the office so I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it over. Probably just catch up later, yeah? I'm gonna head home. Mm, love you too, love you too. Bye. Get the fuck outta here. Asshole. Slut. Do you have any idea what you're doing? I'm a fucking cop. I know. Well what the fuck you want from me? On the night of June 14th, in this house, my house, remember? You and your friend broke into this house and murdered Rebecca Holloway, in cold blood. You shot her right in the head. You then proceeded to rape her sister, my wife, Madeline. Noah, Noah Tate. Shut up. You came for her. You planned this months in advance. But what you didn't plan was for her sister Rebecca to be here. Right? I wanna know why. I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. You hurt women, that's what you do. Go fuck yourself you dog. You raped my fucking wife! Fuck! Fuck! So what's the fucking angle? What are you trying to achieve? What, are you gonna kill me? You gonna kill a fucking cop? You're gonna confess. I'm telling you, you got the wrong guy. Look, I was here, I was on the scene I was fucking working. I saw them load you into the back of the ambulance. Everybody saw me Noah. It wasn't me. I'm sorry for what happened to your family, I really am. It wasn't me. Where the fuck are you going? Noah! Fuck. Oh fuck. Oh, for fuck sake. Is this him? Is this the man that hurt you? Look at him! Yes. You fucking lying bitch! Don't look. Noah. Hey. Have you heard from Tommy at all this morning? No call, no show yesterday. Yeah? Really? Give me a minute, I'm on my way. They just got the DNA results back from that mask, I think we've got him. And the search continues for missing Melbourne PD officer Thomas Wells. Thomas was last seen five days ago leaving an inner city gentleman's club. Hey. We have some good news I think you and your wife will appreciate. We have a suspect in custody. Okay. His name's Robert Conway. Does that mean anything to you? No, it doesn't. He's a repeat offender and suspect in a few rape cases but he was always cleared. Worked night shift at a FedEx warehouse loading trucks for morning pick up, which is how he met her accomplice. I have no doubt in my mind that this is the man we've been looking for Noah. If you're not too busy right now we'd like you to come in for a line up, you and Madeline. All right, so when your number's called you need to step forward and read off the card. Number one step forward. It's just not your day, is it? No. Madeline? Nothing? His eyes, his voice, anything ring a bell? All right, number two step forward. It's just not your day, is it? No, it didn't sound like him. All right, number three step forward. It's just not your day, is it? No. Madeline are you sure? Please, take one more look, take your time. It isn't him. Madeline I believe that's the man who did this thing to you. I believe that man in that room, is the man who murdered your sister. I believe that's the man who raped you and tried to murder your husband. It's okay, you're safe, just tell me it's him. Tell me it's him and this thing is over. It's not him. Why are you doing this? Madeline I know you saw his face. Just tell me the truth. Tell the fucking truth. John. Maddi, wait! That was him. I saw the way you looked at him, tell me I'm wrong. He didn't do it. And those eyes, I remember those eyes. I know you saw his face. Was that him? Yeah, that was him. God damn it Madeline. We, we had him, we. Why didn't you say anything? Why did you lie? This is fucking unbelievable. That cop, it was cold blood Madeline. You have to be quiet okay? You understand? We have to be quiet. At the diner, why were you so sure that that was him? I believed you. I don't know, okay? I thought it was him, I did. I thought we had the right guy. Everyone they looked the same. Sometimes when I think back, I see you. We killed someone. Do you understand? We killed the wrong fuckin' person and now the real killer is walking free. Okay, do you wanna go across the road? Do you wanna go tell your friends what you did? Is that what you want, for us to spend our lives in jail? You know what? Maybe I should. I mean, this is insane. How are we gonna go back to the way things were? I can't live like this, wondering if we're ever gonna get caught. You know you did this, you and that fucking whore. Mel... No, don't touch me. You know it's amazing how quickly your whole world can come crumbling down around you. One minute you're so in love with someone that you just wanna crawl under their skin and the next minute. Tell me Noah, tell me about how you were with her that night, whilst I was being raped, while Bec's was being murdered, whilst I was having a miscarriage? Tell me the truth. Was it worth it? No, but you're right, this isn't the time and place for this. No, fuck you, yes it is. We're doing this now because we might be going away for a very long time. You weren't happy, I wasn't happy. You didn't wanna touch me, you wouldn't look at me, you'd barely kiss me. I tried before her for a really long time, but you just seemed so, uninterested. Do you know what it's like for your wife to ignore your touch? How is that a fucking marriage? You never said anything. I didn't, I didn't know you felt that way. Still, it's not a reason to go fuck someone else. I know I fucked up. And I'm sorry. But does that mean I'm gonna need to pay for this for the rest of my life? I just thought you didn't want me. I did, I do but I want all of you, and I have to be enough. You are enough. What are we gonna do? We've done terrible things. We'll get through this if we stick together.
