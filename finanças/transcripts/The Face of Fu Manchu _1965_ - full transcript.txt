"In the name of Imperial China, "your presence is commanded here "to witness an execution." Let the prisoner be brought forward. "Prisoner before us, "you have been tried and condemned of crimes almost without number. "If it had not been for the tireless efforts of the foreigner "who is with us today, "you might still have escaped our vigilance. "Your efforts to build an empire of crime "have today brought you to the end you so richly deserve. "Let all who envy your thirst for power "take note of your fate." Executioner, in the name of Imperial China, death to Fu Manchu. A rest, they said. A desk job in London, with all the privileges of an Assistant Commissioner at Scotland Yard. I'd rather be back in Burma, Petrie! Oh, it's just this weather getting you down. This damned fog. No, it's... just not being able to get out and get to grips with things. There's something going on, Petrie. Something big. There are signs of it all over Europe. - You mean this crime wave? - No, it's more than that. It's all so centralised, so organised. There's one big mastermind that seems to be controlling the whole thing. Thank you, Lotus. - Water with it? - No, thanks. Haven't you noticed a sudden increase in drug crimes? A number of Orientals involved in gang killings? Not the "Yellow Peril" again! You are overtired! It's all very well for you pathologists. A corpse is a corpse, and that's the end of it. Cheers. To the happy return of the days of hunting Fu Manchu. Why did you say that? - What? - What made you mention Fu Manchu? I don't know. But you haven't mentioned him for months. Look, what is all this? I had a very vivid dream last night, Petrie. I dreamt that Fu Manchu was still alive. And you're taking that seriously? Well... I've been uneasy all day. But you've told me a dozen times, you saw him executed! Yes. Yes, I know. It's a real pea-souper. In half an hour, you won't be able to see your hand in front of your face. Not a night to be out on the beat. Good evening officer. Is this St Luke's, Limehouse? Yes. What do you want here at this time of night? This is it, Professor. Excuse me, sir, but perhaps you don't know it, but St Luke's has been deserted for years. It's all locked up. We have no business with the church, Officer. Oh, sorry, sir. Only trying to be helpful. - Thank you, Officer. Good night. - Good night, sir. Hurry up and park the car, Mathius, will you? Ja, Herr Professor. We're late. The note said "eleven o'clock, precisely". I think you were wrong to come here, Professor. Why choose such a place for a meeting, and on such a night? Anyway, we can't get in. You are wrong. We're expected. I don't think we should go any further. Then wait here. Professor Müller? Yes? You were instructed to come alone. But he's my driver, my servant. Alone. Get up. Come on, sir. Come on. - Where did you get this? - From the neck of a dead man. - You mean it was used by a strangler? - Apparently. As it was of Eastern design, I thought it might interest you. Tibetan. A prayer scarf. Did you examine the weight in this corner? No. I supposed it was a stone. I have a feeling we shall find a small copper medal of the goddess Kali. How did you know? Can I see the body, Petrie? Yes, of course. It's down at the morgue. - Hats and coats, please, Lotus. - Yes, sir. Petrie, remember I told you about my dream last night? About Fu Manchu? Yes. Fu Manchu studied in Tibet. He had great power and influence there. He learned all their secrets of the mind, and also certain other customs. He used as his most trusted servants, a gang of Burmese Dacoits, and taught them to strangle their victims with these prayer scarves from Tibet. To them, the act of murder is blessed by the goddess Kali, and every ritual murder is a passport to heaven. Oh, here we are. This is the one, Doctor. Oh, excuse me. That's strange. The marks have disappeared, haven't they? Well, yes. But the marks of the scarf were on the neck when I examined him in the churchyard, now there isn't a trace of them. And that's impossible! No, Petrie, it's always like that. - Every piece of the pattern fits. - Excuse me, sir. This is Mr Jannsen. He's come to identify the body. Yes. It's him. What was his name? Who are you? Thank you. Nayland Smith, Scotland Yard. This is Dr Petrie. His name is Mathius. He was the servant of my employer, Professor Ernst Müller. Müller... Professor Müller of Heidelberg? You know him? I've heard of him. He's a biochemist, isn't he? Yes. The foremost authority in Europe, if not in the world. I am his personal assistant. - I'd like to talk to him. - He is away. Where? I don't know. When will he be back, Mr Jannsen? I don't know. I'm sorry. I... Perhaps his family could tell me more. No! There is only Maria, his daughter. I'm sure she doesn't know. I see. Do you know what this man was doing down in Limehouse? No. No, I don't. No. I thought you wouldn't. J... K... M... Mac... Mason... Müller. Listen to this, Petrie. "1907, attached to the Government Survey Department of India. "1910, accompanied the Buller expedition to Tibet." I knew there'd be a link! - A link? With Fu Manchu? - Yes. Believe me, Mathius was killed by Fu Manchu's men. What I want to know is, does this mean that Müller is working for Fu Manchu? You keep talking as if Fu Manchu was still alive. - Yes. - But you saw him beheaded! I saw someone beheaded. Lotus, I want you to send this cable to Hong Kong. - Send it urgent rate. - Yes, sir. Petrie, have you found that address yet? Yes. Professor Müller, 27 Hillside, Hampstead. Is that you, Carl? Maria! Oh, Carl! Darling... Are you all right? What happened? There... There was someone out there. He had a knife. He... And he left that message. But I saw no-one. He must still be in the house. No, Carl. The message, please. It must be about Father. "If you value your father's life, say nothing of his disappearance." Carl, what is all this? Where's Father? I don't know, Maria. The laboratory! You stay here, Maria! Somebody here? Carl! You! Do you always greet your visitors so roughly? Carl, who is this? He was at the morgue. He said he was from Scotland Yard. Assistant Commissioner Nayland Smith, at your service. Carl, perhaps he can help us to find Father. No! I don't trust him. But if he's a policeman... Why should he break in here, if he's a policeman? Very well, I'll tell you. There's a man whom I thought was dead. Now, I believe he's still alive. He's cruel, callous, brilliant, and the most evil and dangerous man in the world. His men killed Mathius. I wanted to know if Professor Müller was working for him. That's why I broke in. You thought my father was... Who is this person you are talking about? His name is Fu Manchu. - No... - So you know the name. - Yes. - You? But, Maria... How? Tell me, Miss Müller. This is vital. Two days ago, I was looking out into the garden. My father was there. Suddenly, a Chinaman stepped out from the bushes, and gave my father a letter, and was gone. But... you didn't tell me this. I couldn't, Carl. Father made me promise. Go on, please. Father wanted some supplies sent. The letter promised them if he went secretly to St Luke's, in Limehouse. He was sworn not to tell anyone. And the letter was from Fu Manchu? - Yes. - So... your father did know him. No, he had heard of him, years ago in Tibet, but that's all. Father seemed to be afraid of this name. He said I... I was never to mention it to anyone. Hmm. Do you know what these supplies are that the Professor needs? Yes, I... I'm sorry, I can't tell you. That's Professor Müller's life's work. Mr Jannsen, his life may be worth very little if Fu Manchu has got him. You must tell him. Please, Carl. Very well. In Tibet, there's a flower found only in the inaccessible mountains of the north. It's called the Black Hill Poppy. "The Seed of Life"? Oh, you know it? I've heard of it. I was in the East for many years. There's a legend about it among the Tibetan monks, - if I remember rightly. - Yes. This liquid here is distilled from the seeds of the Black Hill Poppy. It is what the monks refer to in the legend as, er... "The Secret of Universal Life". But that's ridiculous. There's no such thing. We discovered what they really meant, Maria. The true life. The life after this life. Death, in fact? Yes. Universal death. Professor Müller and I have been working on this for a long, long time. And, at last, we have made a breakthrough. We succeeded in stabilising a minute quantity of this liquid, and identifying it as a supreme example of a catalysator of unbelievable strength and efficiency. A single molecule of this would be enough to coagulate the albumen of any living thing. In a matter of seconds, it will, on contact, enter the veins. And a few drops of this would be enough to ensure the death of 10,000 people. No, Carl! Don't be frightened, Maria. This particular sample is absolutely harmless. Look. Then what, in heaven's name, are you talking about? Oh, that's very simple. Once above freezing point, the properties are destroyed, and the liquid is harmless. And below freezing point? Below freezing point... a pint of this would be enough to kill every person and animal in London. How did you obtain your supplies of the Black Hill Poppy? - Cheers. - Prost. Well, Professor Müller had his own supply at first. It was a secret present from the High Lama when he was in Tibet, but... it lasted only a few years. Then, you had to get them on the illegal drug market? - Mm-hmm. - That's how Fu Manchu found out. He'd wait for you to make your breakthrough, and then he'd force you to come to him. How did he do it? Cut off the supplies? Yes. Yes, I suppose so. The supplier said that he couldn't get any more. Who is he? Oh, his name is Hanumon. He has a warehouse down by the Thames. I'll go and see him, - but I'll need you to introduce me. - Of course. I must warn you, that anyone helping me search for the Professor will be risking his life. - I'd still like to come. - Of course. Good afternoon. I would like to see Mr Hanumon. What name should I give? Mr Carl Jannsen. I'm Professor Müller's assistant. Oh, er... could you wait a minute, please? I'll see if he's available. Thank you. I've seen her before somewhere. Or else, she's very like someone. Mr Hanumon will see you now. Good afternoon, gentlemen! Mr Jannsen, so good to see you! And how is Professor Müller? He's been missing since last night. Do you know where he is? Forgive me. I'm afraid I don't know this gentleman. I'm a friend of Professor Müller's. - Smith is the name. - Smith? Smith... No, I still don't recollect you. We're a large family. Branches everywhere. Please, have a seat. I believe that you, too, Mr Hanumon, have, er... a business of international ramifications. Why, yes, Mr Smith. We do have quite an interesting little business. And do you have any connections, by any chance, with the Orient? Oh, why, yes, of course. With some very old, established houses. Excuse me. Yes? Yes, I see. Oh, no, no. That will be all right. Leave it to me. Sorry for that interruption. What were we saying? Oh, yes... In the Orient... Walk out quickly, but smoothly, and don't stop to answer anything this girl says to you. What was all that about?! Remember I said I thought I knew that girl? She must have recognised me, too. That's why she phoned Hanumon on the extension, - and that's why he went for his gun. - But who is she? Name's Lin Tang, daughter of Fu Manchu. You'll pay for this, you fool! He recognised me. He jumped me before I could get to my gun. - Who is he? - Nayland Smith. The man my father hates most in all the world. Come. Nayland Smith to Control. I want an immediate check on Gustav Hanumon. He owns a warehouse in Southwark. I want all you've got on him, and his employees. And I want a constant watch, day and night, on the warehouse. Rise. Father, I bring you bad news. Speak. We had a visit a few minutes ago, from Müller's assistant, and another. Who was the other? Nayland Smith. Nayland Smith. Now the wheel of fate has turned full circle. What progress has been made? None, Master. He does nothing but sit around all day. Bring him in! I have been patient. I will be patient no longer. The secret of the Black Hill Poppy is yours. It shall be mine! You can threaten me as much as you like. I'm not your slave, like these others. Lin Tang. Father? Professor Müller has a daughter, I believe. Yes, Father. Her presence here may be of value. Arrange it. Yes, Father. Hanumon! It was careless of you to allow Nayland Smith to visit your office, and escape. If you value your own life, you will see that Jannsen is eliminated. Tonight. Hello, Operator? Hello? Good evening, Miss Müller. I've come to take you to your father. No! Help! Help! - Warm yourself around the fire, will you? - Thank you. Any messages, Lotus? There's a cable. It came an hour ago. It's from Hong Kong. - Bad news? - Yes. You know, Petrie, that I was convinced that Fu Manchu was still alive? The question then was, - whom did I see executed? - And? An old friend of mine in Hong Kong has been doing some research for me. There was a famous Chinese actor called Lee Toy. He was the same height, the same build, the same age as Fu Manchu. Seven days before Fu Manchu's "death", Lee Toy disappeared. He's never been seen since. But surely you can't believe that an actor, or any man would willingly take the place of another... Not willingly. He had no choice. He was hypnotised by a mind far stronger than his own. Believe me, Fu Manchu could do it. And so, once again, the hunt is on. Nayland Smith. When? And inside the house? I see. Thank you. Ten minutes ago, outside Professor Müller's house, the guard who was on duty was found strangled with a silken scarf. And Maria? The house was empty. She's disappeared. I'm sorry. The guard should have been stronger. This means the Professor isn't cooperating. And now that they've got his daughter, they'll torture her to force his hand. Mr Jannsen, have you any idea... - Well, where is he? - What?! Petrie, phone the Yard! The fool's in danger of his life! Professor Müller. - What is it? I'm not going... - Sssh! - Father! - Maria! Father! Take them through. Your daughter has arrived just in time to witness a practical demonstration of our powers of persuasion. Are you so foolish as to believe that you can oppose the will of Fu Manchu? A favour, Father. I've never liked the girl. Will you leave her to me? Please? No! Stop! Wait! On reflection, I feel a more conclusive lesson would be advisable. - But, Father, first she's mine, and then... - No. For our purposes, I would prefer her body unmarked. Untie her. The door you see before you leads to a small chamber. Twenty feet above our heads is the River Thames. The first of these two levers controls the flow of water with which the chamber can be flooded. The second opens the chamber to the Thames above. The way to Paradise. No! No! Stop it! Stop it! Another suicide. Where one can go, another may follow. - Father! - Maria! What? What is it you want me to do? Distil for me the liquid of the Black Hill Poppy. I have enough seeds here for your purpose. How long does the process take? A week. Seven days... is not long to wait. Soon my plans will be ready, and the world shall hear from me again. I must warn you, Fu Manchu. For my daughter's sake, I'll... I'll distil the liquid. But my research is not yet complete. Once exposed to heat, the liquid is useless! I'm not lying! Would I risk Maria's life?! In Tibet, they had the secret. How otherwise would they have used it as an instrument of death? They did not give the secret to us. Only the High Lama may do that. And he wouldn't see us. But he saw the Younghusband expedition. He gave them secrets. - You're lying. - I am not lying. Of course he gave it to the Younghusband expedition. Why do you think I'm working here, in London? I can do my work just as easily in my own country. But the Younghusband papers are here, - Father! - ...and I'm not allowed to see them! This man, Gaskell. He's stupid! He's jealous! He has the papers and he says "No"! - Father, stop it! - Very interesting, Professor. Vanity. Jealousy. They bring us much that we need. The information that you want, Professor, is it in those papers? Yes. - Who has them? - Gaskell. Professor Gaskell. And where are they kept? The Museum of Oriental Studies. They are always locked in the vaults. Only Gaskell has access to them. Working late tonight, Professor Gaskell? Hmm? Eh? Oh yes, it's you, Perkins. I hadn't noticed. - What is the time? - Past seven o'clock, Professor. You don't say? I was just on my way to lunch. Yes, I thought it was getting rather dark. Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear. Yes? Oh, I understand. Younghusband papers? Where? The Museum of Oriental Studies? Just a moment, I'll make a note of it. "Younghusband... "papers. "Museum... "of... "Oriental Studies." Yes. Today. Yes, yes. Yes, he is. Oh, no, no, no. There'll be no mistake. I shall look to it at once. Yes. Museum of Oriental Studies, ten o'clock. All right. Mr Jannsen, I see no further reason for delay. Officer! Constable. Tell Nayland Smith... the Museum of Oriental Studies... Guard the Museum of Oriental Studies! I can assure you, sir, that the place is now an impregnable fortress. No Chinaman, or for the matter of that, any other kind of man can break into the Museum. At least not when I'm the Director. I can only repeat, Sir Charles, that Fu Manchu is no ordinary man. That's why the police guard has been doubled. I've got men on every rooftop overlooking the Museum, and constant patrols outside the gates. But inside, it's your responsibility. And only right and proper, too. We don't want your flat-footed coppers messing about with our treasures, do we? I'm only interested in one of your treasures, which lies in your vaults. The Younghusband papers. Mmm, it's a wonder they're still with us, seeing as they're in old Gaskell's charge. - Who? - Professor Gaskell. He's brilliant, but eccentric. He's one of our greatest authorities on Tibet. In that case, I should like to speak to him. Well, it's not so easy. He's liable to disappear for weeks at a time. However, I'll see if I can find him. Has Professor Gaskell come in yet this morning? He hasn't. Right, thank you very much indeed. No. He's probably lost all sense of time, and thinks it's Christmas. I'm afraid you've drawn a blank. Where does he live? In some big barn of a house in the middle of the Essex marshes. No electric lights. No telephone. But my secretary will give you the address. Thank you. In the meantime, I'd like to take a look at your security precautions. Help yourself. Oh, by the way, what was the name of that Chinese man you were talking about? Fu Manchu. I've never heard of him. - How do you feel? - Thanks. Better. What news is there? Not much. Our men broke into the Hanumon warehouse, - but the birds had flown. - And Maria? Still no sign, I'm afraid. Now, are you quite sure we're on the right track about these Younghusband papers? Yes. Quite certain. Once Professor Müller has them, he is able to complete his research. It must be what they're after. Well, we'll give him a hard time. Unfortunately, this lunatic Director won't allow our men inside. Let's hope they didn't get as far as that. Your pass, Madam? Thank you. - Who is she? - Old Lady Shiptree. Been coming here for years. Passes, please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What about them? Oh, they're in London for some big student conference, on their way to the Reading Room. Blimey, you do get a mixed bunch here. It takes all sorts to make a world. All I can say is, a fly couldn't get in here undetected, let alone Fu Manchu. I wish I shared your confidence, Petrie. Surely, the guards are experienced enough? That's just the trouble. They've all been here so long, they can't believe that a determined gang of ruthless men could possibly enter the museum. - Oh, for a section of Gurkhas. - I see what you mean. Look at that party over there. They seem innocent enough. But I wonder. It's in the vaults below that danger really lies. Nevertheless, I'd like to check on them. Go ahead. We'll take a look downstairs. Hello, sir! What are you doing here? Robinson! I haven't seen you since Delhi. - How long have you been working here? - Retired five years ago, sir. Been in charge of the vaults here ever since. - Then I know they're in good hands. - Thank you, sir. - Mr Jannsen. - Hello, sir. Hello. Robinson, which, er... safe contains the Younghusband papers? This one over here, sir. Mm-hmm. Who has access to them? Only the Director, sir. And Professor Gaskell. What's the security like, Robinson? Oh, the best there is, sir. Why, this vault was built over a hundred years ago, sir. Like a fortress, it is. Yes, well, the walls are thick enough. Hundred years, you say? But these arches appear to be older. Yes. Early eighteenth century. Originally, this was one of the sewers of the City of London, sir. They adapted it when they built the museum. That tunnel there led all the way to the river before they blocked it up. The Thames... Carl, have you noticed how every thread leads to the river? I wonder... Robinson, let us out of your cage for a moment, will you? Certainly, sir. This is the old tunnel, all right. Have a look on the other side, Carl. Look out! Robinson! I'll take him! Good God, what's happening?! Your impregnable fortress, Sir Charles. But what the devil are these, er... Chinese doing in here? They came through the old sewer workings. - You all right, Robinson? - I think I'm all right, sir. And now, I'd like to take a look at those Younghusband papers. Very well. You'll find them perfectly safe, I can assure you. - I hope you are right. - So do I. Tie him up. They're gone. Robinson! Here, quickly! When did you last see the Younghusband papers? Well, er... not since yesterday morning, sir, when Professor Gaskell came down for them, just like he always does. And last night? Well, he, er... Wait, wait a bit, sir. I didn't go off duty until seven-thirty, and the Professor hadn't returned them by then. - Do you know if he was working late? - I don't know. I'll find out. The gate, please. Gate? Director speaking. What time did Professor Gaskell leave the museum last night? Seven o'clock? Aha. Was he carrying anything with him? A large briefcase. Right, thank you. It would appear, gentlemen, that we are locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. Professor Gaskell has surpassed even himself. He took the Younghusband papers home with him last night. Come on, Carl. Wait a minute! You can't leave the museum littered with dead Chinese! Oh, here you are. Well, it took a hell of a time to prove it, but those chaps really were students, after all. - So everything's all right. - I'm so glad you think so, Petrie. Professor Gaskell's taken the Younghusband papers home with him. Oh, has he? Oh, that reminds me... The Director's secretary said you wanted Gaskell's address. It's the Moat House, Lone Marsh, Essex. - And his telephone's been cut off. - I'll phone the Yard. At least Fu Manchu doesn't know where the papers are. - Come on. Let's wait outside. - All right. Hello! What's this? Believe it or not, Sir Charles is phoning the Yard for me. Oh, what's this? The old lady must have dropped her hearing aid. It's a highly directional amplifier, and you've just read out Gaskell's address. She just left! She's in a hurry. - Who was that woman in the wheelchair? - Lady Shiptree, sir. Something odd about her today. Run! Nayland Smith to Control. This is an emergency. A black and beige Lanchester, heading eastward from the Museum of Oriental Studies. It must be stopped! We're gaining on them! They're close behind! Everything is arranged. Faster! Fu Manchu has evaded us, and is heading eastward through the dock area. All cars to intercept. This is vital! Father, there's another car following us! Turn along by the coal depot. Driver, head for Lone Marsh in Essex. - Moat House. - Right, sir. Turning off towards you, now. We've lost him! Professor Gaskell. Just a moment. Just a... I beg your pardon? Sit down. Look at me. Your will is subject now to mine. You will do only what I command you to do. Stand up. You will strike your hand against the wall, but you will feel no pain. You will obey me now, until death. Until death. Come. Maria, look! I've done it. Not in seven days, but in four. - Only four days! - Father, please! If you don't... My father will be very pleased to receive this news. Father. Rise, Daughter. Two items of excellent news. First, the Professor has succeeded. Already? - And the other news? - A forecast. Tomorrow morning, the Essex marshes will be several degrees below freezing point. - Is Hanumon ready? - Yes, Father. You bring the news at an opportune moment. Turn on the wireless. Switch in the transmitter. Transmitter on, please. Transmitter on. Coming in a bit now. This is the British Broadcasting Company. Eight o'clock, and here is the news. Reports are still coming in from India... Go ahead, please. Attention. Attention. This is Fu Manchu. Stand by for an important message. I repeat, this is Fu Manchu. In a few days' time, I shall speak again to this country, and, through it, to the entire world. What I tell you to do then, must be done immediately. Anyone who disobeys... will perish. To show you this is no idle threat, I give you this warning: "Remember... "Fleetwick." I repeat: "Remember Fleetwick." That is all. How did he do it? Simple. Another transmitter somewhere. - But why? Is he mad? - No, Petrie. At least, not in the way you mean. You underrate him if you think that. Fleetwick. Do you know it? Yes, it's in Essex somewhere, isn't it? What does it all mean? It means that he's nearly ready to make his move. Fleetwick will be some sort of demonstration of power. Can you stop him? We can try, Carl. Nayland Smith. Yes, sir. Oh, it was his voice all right, sir. Get all the assistance you can to Fleetwick, sir. The Army? Well, most certainly, sir. Goodnight, sir. That was the Home Secretary. The Army's going to cordon off the whole town. 'Ere, fancy anybody wanting to live in a place like this. I've never been so bloody cold! This Chinaman can have this place for my money. - Ha! 'Ere, how long, do you reckon? - How long what? - Have we got to stay here, of course? - Oh, God knows! I hope we don't have a night like last night. He must be bloody frozen up there. Serves him right. Hey, it's not bad, for a change. Hey, you reckon the... We interrupt this programme to bring you grave and serious news. Less than an hour ago, disaster struck the village of Fleetwick in Essex. It is confirmed that the entire population, together with Army units guarding the village, are dead. Cause of the deaths is at present a mystery. Estimates place the total death roll at nearly 3,000. We will broadcast further details as they come to hand. I could kill him. With my own bare hands, I could kill him. To get this effect, this village must have been sprayed from the air. There was a plane reported in the area at the time. We're searching for it. You can stand there and discuss how it was done, with all this?! We still have our jobs to do, Petrie. A house has been cleared in here, sir, if you wish to use it. Thank you. Right in the middle of breakfast. Turn that tap off, Carl. Sir... - No answer. - No answer. A plane was seen coming in to land near Gravesend. They're searching all the fields. Wasn't that where the plane that bombed us was spotted? No, further up the river. The river... The Thames! Do you remember, back at the museum, I said time and again the River Thames was linked with Fu Manchu? Yes First, Limehouse, where Mathius was murdered. Yes, and Hanumon's warehouse is on the river. And the Chinese girl's body was found in the river, too. And the sewer to the museum, and now these two reports about the aeroplane. Every time, the same link: the River Thames. Oh, Constable. Go and ask the Army if they can lend us a map of London, will you? Attention. Attention. This is Fu Manchu. This is Fu Manchu. Remember Fleetwick. What I have done there, I can do again. You know now that I must be obeyed, that I am all-powerful. In two more days, I shall give my commands. They will be carried out at once, or ten thousand shall die. Ten thousand... and one particular man. That is all. "One particular man." You. Two days. We have two days. - Sir. - Thank you. The map. Now... where are we? Limehouse... St Luke's... The warehouse should be... there. Well, well, well! The Hanumon warehouse is directly opposite St Luke's, on the other side of the river. What is the dotted line across the river? I don't know. There aren't any bridges or anything there. Look, there's another one, just down by Woolwich. Hmm, there's a legend here. "Disused installations, communications, and ammunition tunnels." Of course. The old tunnels leading to the military docks. With two main entrances by the river. We've got it! I'll swear we have! We'll check with the Royal Engineers, and cordon off the whole area. So that's the answer. So simple. And I've been working, labouring for years. Maria. The essence of the Black Hill Poppy can be stabilised, so that it retains its properties at all temperatures. - But you must never tell Fu Manchu. - No, no, no, that is true. Father, do you know that the essence you made two days ago has been removed? - Removed? - Maybe it's already been used! Now, if you confide in him... This man has done everything that I have commanded. The Younghusband papers have been translated, and the secrets that they contain have been revealed. You, Professor, will now complete your work. To turn their theory into practice, requires new supply of the seeds of the Black Hill Poppy. - And... And more time. - You shall have both. But, as to time... two days. I'm tired. I want to sleep. My will is yours. Even unto death. Obviously, Professor, you still need to be reminded of what may happen to your daughter. No-one can get beyond this point. North and south of the Thames, two battalions. And the Hanumon warehouse? The Royal Engineers are going to blow it up at dawn. What about the river? Got aircraft patrolling overhead, and destroyers at the mouth. Can all this save Professor Müller and Maria? Right. Good. Just what I'd been hoping. Two figures have been observed making their way across the rooftops to the churchyard. They must be the crew of the plane. Ah, getting back to their headquarters, eh? And leading us to the secret entrance. What? We are going in? We'll nab them, and take their places, are you with me? Of course. Petrie, if we're not back by dawn, blast open the Hanumon warehouse, find that tunnel, and flood it! But if you're still below? You flood it. They were seen coming in in that direction. Wait here. Maria. Maria! Carl! Professor, this is Nayland Smith. Ssh! - Do you know how to open the door? - No, I don't. It's a combination lock, but there's an alarm system. If we could fuse it, you could blow the lock off. Good evening, Mr Nayland Smith. This is indeed an honour. There is no escape, Fu Manchu. The way out's blocked and guarded. Indeed. Professor Müller and his daughter are well aware of at least one way out, which is still open. Once before, you had the satisfaction of witnessing my execution, Commissioner. On this occasion, I can promise you, there will be no substitutes for the condemned. Get out! Close the door! The lights! Douse the lights! Carl! Maybe we fused the whole system. I hope so. I'm going to blow that lock off. - What about the alarm? - Probably we fused that, too. You stay here. There may be more Dacoits. Okay. - Carl! - Come on. Quick! Take cover! Petrie! Thank God you're safe! Where's the Professor? The rest are trapped below. Tunnel's flooded. I wouldn't be too sure about that. News has just come through from the river that three people were seen emerging in mid-stream wearing submarine escape equipment. They were picked up by a fast launch, and they went off downriver. Report just come in from the Thames Estuary, sir. Fog is even thicker there. Visibility nil. Damn! With his organisation and this fog, we'll never find him. - But you can't just give up! - Look. So, we've lost him. Maria, there were three figures. Your father must still be alive. Fu Manchu would see to that. They won't get far. Every port on the Continent's being watched. What makes you think that he's heading there? While he has the Professor, he can fulfil his ambitions. But he still has to distil the liquid. Yeah, and therefore, he needs supplies of the Black Hill Poppy. And they grow in one place. Tibet. Greetings, Fu Manchu. It is my devout hope that you have the news we are awaiting. The Grand Lama's subjects have searched the mountain slopes, for the seeds of the holy flower, the Black Hill Poppy. The result of their labours is on its way to this palace. Our blessings upon you. Take the casket to the appointed place. Fu Manchu... you will join us in prayer till the twelfth hour. We must ask guidance that you may use this gift wisely. Professor. Professor. It's me, Carl Jannsen. Your daughter Maria is waiting for us. - She's dead. - No, no, you are wrong, Professor. She's waiting for us, less than a mile from here. - Is that the truth? - Yes, and you are coming with us. - No, but I can't... - Ssh! But I can't leave here. With the contents of this box, and the knowledge he already has, Fu Manchu would be able to achieve his ambition now. There's enough nitroglycerine in that box to blow the whole palace sky high. I'm just going to set the fuse for the twelfth hour. There's no chance of getting through the gate. We'll have to do as we planned, and go over the wall. Stay on watch. Have your ropes ready. We've got fifteen minutes till the palace goes up. Cover our escape till then. You two, come with me. - How did this happen?! - Nayland Smith was here! They must not get away. If necessary, shoot to kill. Yes, sir. Come on. What is it, Father? Why did Nayland Smith leave the seeds here? The world shall hear from me again. The world shall hear from me again!
