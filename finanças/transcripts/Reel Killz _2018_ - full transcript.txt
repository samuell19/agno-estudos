(eerie music) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (heartbeat pounding) [Manny] I tend to look at life as my own little movie, and moments as scenes that I can capture and manipulate. (jogger screaming) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (car engines humming) (drums beating) (birds chirping) Mom! Mom! So, how did it go? I don't know, how's it suppose to go? Well, did you ask any questions? I don't like this school, Mom. Zach! This is your future we're talking about. You know, you need to be more proactive and seize the best opportunities in front of you, otherwise another kid is gonna take it. I know, Mom. Lets just go to the next tour. Okay, but this time can I go inside with you? [Zach] Sure. Come on. (birds chirping) Hey, don't let all this adult stuff get to you, okay? I mean, just think in a couple of months, you'll be out of my sight and you can do whatever you want. Hey, Mom, stop the car! (tires screeching) Hey, kid, you need to be more careful. You're walking in the middle of the road. I'm sorry, ma'am. I've been walking all morning, I guess I'm a little exhausted. - Do you need a ride? - Yeah, a ride would be great. I mean, it's not too far where I'm heading. Get in, we can take you there. Right, Mom? Sure, we can give you a lift. - Thanks! - Where is it you're going again? I'm heading to set, the crew and I are shooting our opening scene today. - (ominous music) - Awesome, bro. Come on, get in. - Thanks. - Yeah. I'm Zach and this is my mom, Deborah. Hi, I'm Manny. Nice to meet you both. (Manny sighs) I'm the camera guy in case you haven't noticed. Good for you. I always thought I'd make a great actress. You can still go after it and you look far too young to be this guys mother. - Hey, thanks! (Deborah giggling) Besides after awhile it gets kind of annoying having to force people to be in my films. It would be nice for a change, say someone like yourself to volunteer. Dude, what are you talking about? I can't imagine my mom acting. Trust me there are a lot of things you haven't seen me do. Like what, Mom? I was a college student once myself. Anyway, am I heading in the right direction? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll tell you when to turn. Uh, so have you done any big projects? Nah, not yet but my name will be out there very shortly. Right on, man. Just remember the people who gave you a ride once you made a name of yourself. Ah, this is the right right here. - That tiny street? - Yeah. - It's a bit creepy out here. - That's the idea. So, uh, what brings you both out here? Ugh, getting this one to tour college campuses to get his butt motivated. Hey, I have a solid C average. Hey, C's get degrees, right? Are you in school? Nah, learning the craft on my own. Well, you know just keep at it. I hear that the film industry is competitive, so a little persistence goes a long way. Hey, are you like one of those filmmakers who can see someone taking a shit and make something creative out of it? - Ew. - Well let me put it this way. I tend to look at life as my own little movie and moments as scenes that I can capture and manipulate. Well, maybe you can manipulate this one into taking his senior year more seriously. - (Manny chuckling) - Mom, come on. This is it. What kinda scene are you filming? - (ominous music) - Uh, if you want I can show you around the set? - I'm down. - Um. Whatever it is has to be better than touring college campuses. Thank you, but we really need to get back to our next destination. Aw, come on. Let me at least introduce you to my crew. Whoa. Who are those chicks? Promise, that's my lead actress. Damn, we are definitely getting introductions before we go, Mom. I don't see a problem with that. But you know, watch the cussing young man. [Zach] All right, I'm sorry mom. [Manny] Let's go meet my crew. (birds chirping) We were starting to worry about you little guy. A good cameraman is hard to find these days. Hi, there. Why, hello there. Who's this young woman, Manny? Hi, I'm Deborah. - This is my son, Zach. - Hey. We, we just wanted to get Manny back safe and sound. We have somewhere we need to be. Mom, we just got here. - Hey. - Hi. How's it going? Just trying to survive college tours. Zach, we can't stay. (keys jingling) What are you doing with my keys? So, how do you see us filming this? (suspenseful music) Survival horror. Let's do it already. Shit, run, Zach, run! Action! (dramatic music) - We can't go that way. - Just follow me. (gravel crunching) Damn it! Some stairs over there mom. Come on. - Where? - Right here, come on, Mom. (dramatic music) (door creaking) (door thudding) (suspenseful music) (shoe thudding) Let's split up. (light dramatic music) Wait, yeah, come on. (Promise whistling) (eerie music) There's no way out. (boards thudding) Come out, come out. You know something that bothers me? This world has gone crazy despite so many wannabe heroes. I think what this world needs is more monsters. (ax clanking) (dramatic music) - Like me! (Deborah screaming) - (Deborah groaning) - Run and don't look back! Hope you know what's coming. (Deborah coughing) You pathetic woman! (Promise grunting) (Deborah groaning) (ominous music) - Boo. - Hey. - Come on. - Stop, help! Help, somebody! Help. (Zach groaning) - You're a freak! - Help, help. There is no help! You see we vampires prefer aged blood, but the zombies in these parts, oh they're gonna flock when I open you up. (suspenseful music) (fist thudding) (Zach groaning) (train crossing dinging) (train rattling) (train horn blowing) Help! Help! (suspenseful music) Help! Help! (Zach screaming) (body crunching) [Promise] Where do you think you're going? (Deborah crying) We haven't released you from set. [Deborah] Please stop! [Manny] Come on. - Please stop. - Come on now. Don't worry. Gonna make you a star out of this. Like you always wanted to be. (Deborah crying) I'm sorry. (Deborah gagging) (suspenseful music) (Deborah gasping) (dramatic music) (light dramatic music) (pills rattling) [Jennifer] Why do I feel so alone all the time? Why can't I just feel normal? I'd give up everything to be around others who understood me. The real me. Hm, what a beautiful life that would be. (light dramatic music) (car door slamming) (garage door whirring) (gentle piano music) (birds chirping) (car door slamming) (car engine rumbling) (eerie music) (birds chirping) (gravel crunching) (wind whistling) (car door slamming) - Jenny! - Hey, Stacy! Oh, my gosh I've missed you so much. Oh, I can't believe my favorite two people in the whole world are finally meeting. (Jennifer chuckling) Come on. - Hey. - Hey! - This is Mitch, my husband. - Wow. Mitch, this is my big sister Jenny. So nice to finally meet you Jennifer. I think I've heard a little about you. All good stuff I hope? All good stuff. So, can I help you with your bags? Actually, that'd be great. There in my back seat. - Thank you. - Sure! - Oh, man. - Oh and these emails that I've been getting from her about, just gushing about this guy. - Really? - Oh, hey, speaking of email. I sent something to your work address and I received a message back saying account not existing. Yeah about that. I quit my job. When? About a month ago. Well, how are you getting by? - Do you need help? - I have some savings. - For how long? - Stacy, I'm gonna to be okay. Okay. So, am I the last one to arrive here at this family reunion of ours? [Stacy] You are, but thanks so much for making it down here. I know it was last minute but I've been dying for you to meet Mitch. (Jennifer sighs) And to catch up with you of course. - Of course. - Mm. (knife scraping) Mom! Look who's here. Well, if it ain't my long lost daughter. How you doing baby? Hi, mom. Are you taking care of yourself 'cause something's different. No, mom I actually, I just rolled around in dog shit all day. (Barbra giggling) You know, for the hell of it. I like that. Still somethings different. [Stacy] Oh, stop it you too. We just got together. I'm a mother, I can't help but notice these things. Hey, um, about the sleeping arrangements. Would you mind sharing the bunk room with mom? Mitch and I kinda wanna take the second room. Yeah, that's fine. - That'd be great! - Mm. Thanks! (door creaking) I put your bags in your room. - Oh, thank you. - It's no problem. Mom, did you bring old home made movies of the family? It was the weirdest thing. There was this guy here earlier, he was selling 'em and I just bought some so he'd leave. - Oh, my God. - Oh, hey, Mom. Don't you think it's a little early to start getting drunk? Listen, Missy. This is only my second glass. - We've all heard that before. - I'm good. Okay, let's just try to make these three days great. Uh, Mitch could you pour three glasses please. - Sure. - I'd like to make a toast. [Jennifer] Okay, Mom, it's fine, I'm fine, it's fine. [Barbra] It's so good to see you though. - I know. - Thank you. - Mm hm. - Jen. - Thank you. - Hun. Thank you. Okay, here's to a great weekend with the three people I care most about in life. Cheers! (glasses clinking) - To us. - To family. Yeah. - You're not drinking? - No. I'm just not in the mood. - Hm, I see. (Jennifer scoffs) (fist knocking) I think somebody's at the door. Aren't you a cute young thang. Why are you showing up at my doorstep for? I'm Bobby. I'm from Divine Message Church. I've come to spread the good Lord's message with you all. [Barbra] Well, yes, yes you have. Come right in and share the good Lord's wealth with us. - Wine? - Uh, no thank you. - Underage? - No. - Recovering? - No, just not while I'm spreading the gospel. (Barbra laughing) Oh, it never stopped Jesus from spreading his message. I think that's a little different. You know what? My friends been telling me that they pay people like you nowadays 'cause they can't get anybody to do it. God's blessings are all the payments I need. Oh, honey. God don't pay your bills. Well, I, I, I have a job. This is just something I do during my free time. You look like you have a really nice body under those clothes. You know there are other ways to earn a living. Excuse me? Oh, sweetheart you aren't offended. - Okay, Mom please just- - You know what? Leave the poor church boy alone. I'm so sorry about my mom. She's obviously a little tipsy. - No I'm not. - That's okay. I probably should be going. Uh, I feel like as if I'm casting pearls before swine. - Hey, wait, wait a sec. - Now, look, okay, oh. [Mitch] Why don't you just go ahead and... Thanks for stopping by. You all need God in your lives. Especially you! God is talking to me right now and he's telling me that you need God in your life- Okay. - Mitch, okay. - And that there's evil - lurking around you. - Okay, okay. Like Jesus said Ezekiel 23:1. "The word of the lord came again-" [Barbra] We don't need church to find God. (door slamming) Asshole! - Have a blessed day. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Wow, what is wrong - with these people nowadays? - I don't know. I'm just hearing from different sources that these religious folks and they'll all like God this, and God and Jesus! No pun intended! (Mitch chuckling) [Stacy] Hey, don't pay any attention to that bullshit. I'm not. I'm just gonna go unpack some of my stuff. Okay. It's okay. What? Your sister is pregnant. She doesn't even have a boyfriend. Stacy darling, you don't have to have a boyfriend to get knocked up. I can testify to this from personal experience. I'm not telling you which one. - Ew. - It was you. - Okay. - Babe. Hey, uh would you like some more wine? Um, sure. And so would I, the box is over there. - Yes ma'am. - Hurry up. Wee! (Barbra chuckling) (birds chirping) (crows cawing) (light dramatic music) (gravel crunching) Hey! Hey, are you okay? What in the devil's name are you doing recumbent on the tracks there? (Bobby gasps) (Manny hushes) Why? I'm trying to get you in focus fool. Focus for what? - Julies Caesar, action! (dramatic music) Et tu, Caesar! (rock thudding) (Bobby groaning) Looks like your gonna meet God sooner than expected bible boy! - (Axle chuckling) - Cut. (suspenseful music) (camera reel clicking) (dog barking) (eerie music) - Knock, knock. (fist knocking) - Hey, what's up? - Just making sure that creep didn't freak you out. Oh, it's gonna take a lot more than a bible thumper to scare me. Good to know. Hey, you sure you're okay? Stacy, I'm right here. What do I have to do or say to let you and mom know I'm gonna be okay? Sorry, jeez. No, just I'm sorry, okay? I just woke up really late today. So, what do you think of Mitch? Well, he's obviously very cute. He seems nice. I like him. - Really? - Yeah, I'm happy for you. Thanks. I love him so much. - Look at you blushing. - Stop, I can't help it. I miss talking to you. I miss a lot of things we use to do together. I'm sorry. No, nothing to be sorry about. But I am. About a lot of things. Like your wedding. - Nothing to apologize about. - But I want to though. Well, the rehab helped, right? Yeah, it did. Well, then you're already forgiven. Health always first. (both giggling) What? (Stacy sighs) Mom says you're pregnant. Moms says a lot of things when she's drinking. She's usually right about us. Remember you can talk to me about anything. Wait, there's nothing to talk about. [Stacy] Jenny! I haven't said anything because I don't plan on keeping it. Why not? - Jenny! - I can't raise a kid, Stacy! - Yes, you can! - Look at me. I'm a mess! You can't be any worse of a mother than mom. Okay, that's not a really good selling point. Well, I thought you said you were feeling better. I don't have a job. This baby's sperm donor doesn't wanna have anything to do with it and look at me. I can't even pretend to be happy. (somber music) Just follow me. Where are we going? Just follow me. Mitch we about finished up the wine in there. I think it's about time that you fire up that truck of yours and head on into town for a little liquor run. 'Cause I think this is gonna be a two or three box weekend. - You feel me? - All right, Barbra. (light music) Do you remember this well? Yeah I do. When we were little and you always felt like an outsider with our friends and our cousins, you would always come and you would stand by this well. And remember I told you, you're unique, you're different and that's okay. Most people won't understand, but some will. Like me, like that baby. Hey, look what I found when I was unpacking earlier. I'll always be here for you. And if you decide to have that baby. I'll move to Dallas and help you raise it the first year. (gentle music) I love you. I love you too. How are you not the older sister? 'Cause someone had to be the younger hotter one. Oh, jeez. Come on. (light music) (birds chirping) How long is this gonna take? Are you even listening to me? You know something? The time has come for us to build our empire. We finally found our catalyst girl. What the hell is a catalyst girl? Those lips form a smile so sinister a man could just die from kissing them. (Axle chuckling) Cool it, girl. Ain't no one getting replaced. Hear that? - (footsteps thudding) - It's showtime. (light dramatic music) (eerie music) (light dramatic music) - Action! (suspenseful music) [Jogger] I'm sorry did you say something? Don't you want to see what's in my basket of goodies for grandma? Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't know what kinda sick prank you're trying to pull but I have mace. Sorry, little red, but the woodsman can't save you now. Don't take another step towards me. (jogger groaning) [Promise] Don't you know it's not safe to stay in the woods alone? (suspenseful music) (jogger screaming) (birds chirping) Whatever, I've never done that. That is not what your mother said. What are you two laughing about? - Nothing. - Uh, just the crazy things mom says when she is drunk. Tell me about it. Where did my keys go anyway? [Jennifer] I haven't seen 'em. - Ah, I found 'em. (keys jingling) - Thanks, babe. - Yeah. Hey, uh, Mitch is gonna drive to the drug store to get a couple things we forgot when we were packing. - Do you need anything? - No, I'm good. Well, if you change your mind just text me okay? I will, thanks. - Drive safe. (Jennifer sighs) It's getting dark out. [Mitch] I will. - (door creaking) - What? Aw, look at you all in love. Aw, well. I'm gonna go finish unpacking. You wanna help? (Jennifer grumbling) Okay. I just need to grab something out of my car real fast. Okay. (door creaking) (car engine rumbling) (gravel crunching) (light dramatic music) (baby crying) (eerie music) (door slamming) (fist knocking) - Hey, can I help you? - Please. [Jennifer] What's wrong? I need to call someone. - Can I come inside? - Uh, of course. Do you mind telling me what's going on? I wanna go home? Are you lost or in trouble? I just wanna go home to my family. Okay. Well, you're not giving me much to go on here. Do I need to call the police? No, let me call my mom please. Oh, yeah. Here you go, here's the phone. Do you want me to dial the number? (Claire sniffling) What's your name? Claire. Claire Owens. Okay. Mama, it's me. I escaped. Come get me. What kind of trouble are you in? They make me do things I don't wanna do. Who? - (thudding) - He found me! - Uh. (ominous music) Just... (door creaking) Look, there's no one out there, okay? Just, just, you'll be safe in here. Nobody can get you. I'll be right back. I'm gonna get my sister, okay? (door creaking) (Claire panting) (eerie music) - Stacy, come on! (door creaking) I'm coming, jeez. Where is she? Okay, she, she was right here. I swear! Maybe her ride came? So she just leaves the door open? Okay, well did you get a name? Yeah. Claire Owens. Claire Owens? [Jennifer] She was really scared. Hey, relax. I'm sure she's fine. I know. Uh, well, this doesn't make any sense. - What? - Jennifer, the last call was made three hours ago. No, no, no, no, I saw her. I saw her make a call. I saw her dial the number. I know I did. I mean, I think. You know what? She can't be far. Look, hey, if she comes back I'll let you know. Okay? There was something about her eyes. - What do you mean? (light dramatic music) Never... You're right, I don't need to worry about it. Hey, look, I need to run to the shed to get some dining wear. We can talk about this when I get back. Just stay inside. Okay. (eerie music) (Jennifer sighs) (crickets chirping) (door creaking) (eerie music) (pills rattling) - Jenny! (door creaking) There's some man outside. He's looking for Claire! - What? - Come here. (eerie music) What the hell, he was just here. Did you get his name? Oh, no, I didn't even think to ask. Okay, this is exactly what Claire did to me and then I went and got you, and we came back she was gone! Uh, gosh, I hate getting caught in the middle of teenage drama. Should we be worried? No, I don't think so. I mean, if anything it's just a couple bored teenagers playing a prank on us. No, I think we should call the cops, Stacy. She did say that there was someone making her do stuff that she didn't wanna do and this could be that guy. (Stacy scoffs) Oh, don't say that. That guy seemed pretty harmless to me. (eerie music) Where are you going? I'm just gonna go for a walk. Would you like me to join you? No. But if you'd wake mom up and help her with dinner I'd appreciate it. Yeah, I don't mind. Be safe on your walk. (Stacy sighs) (door creaking) (suspenseful music) (light dramatic music) [Manny] The funny thing about life is that sometimes the strangers we meet understand our true selves the most. (car engine humming) (light rock music) Hey, there. - Hi. - What's your name? - Jennifer. - Hi, Jennifer. Your very pretty. - Thanks. - I mean it. Do you wanna come hang out with us? Thanks anyways but I gotta get back. Oh, come on. It'll be fun. No, my family is waiting. Well, we can drive you back. Right, Manny? The girl said no, let her be. [Promise] Suit yourself. [Jennifer] Do I know you? The beautiful thing about life is that sometimes the strangers we meet understand our true selves the most. Where did you hear that? We read. Y'all haven't seen a brunette girl walk by here have you? Thanks anyway. It was nice to meet you all. - You better get back. (ominous music) (crickets chirping) Hey, Mom. Are you still close with any of the neighbor's nearby? No, not since we quit coming out here regularly. Why do you ask? There were two kids that showed up at different times today and I'm pretty sure they were just playing a prank on us. But it kinda spooked Jennifer. (Barbra giggling) Well, you know how easy Jennifer is to spook. Uh, but what in the world were they doing running around on my private property playing pranks for? - (door creaking) - Mitch? - Nope, it's just me. - Oh. (door slamming) [Jennifer] He's not back yet? No and his phone keeps going straight to voicemail. Well, you know, the drug store is right next - to the strip club. - Mom, that is outrageous. Oh, mom, mom, mom. Can't you just take a joke? Isn't he usually really good about checking his phone when he is out? Yeah, I mean that's the thing. He's always really good at keeping his phone charged and he's usually pretty attentive when I call or text. (phone ringing) Hello? No, but may I ask who's calling? Hello? - (Stacy sighs) - Who's that? I think it was just a wrong number. - (eerie music) - You sure? Yeah, hey, let's just eat. I'm starving. I'm actually gonna go change. I've been wearing this since the road trip. I feel gross. Jennifer could you please hurry because I'm starving too. Yeah, Mom. (eerie music) (light dramatic music) (eerie music) (dramatic music) Mom? Hello? (suspenseful music) What the hell was he doing in there with her? Oh, he's just trying to scare her. Oh, is that all? She's more than just a good shot, Axle, and you know that. I know. Just text him and tell him to keep his filthy ass away from her. [Axle] All right, I'll talk to him. It's not time. I know. Here's your wardrobe for the next scene. Hells bells, Stacy. Give it a rest. Men need a break sometimes. And you do not want to be that nagging wife. What, that's not why I'm staring at my phone. Why are you staring at your phone? - I just- - Who cares! How did my pasta turn out? [Stacy] It's good. Well, at least you tried it. Jennifer you didn't eat anything. You need to eat something. You're eating for two or more now. You know, it would do you a world of good if you would take care of yourself. Mom, could you just please stop nagging her! No, that's fine. Let her, I'm use to it. All I'm saying is you have issues. (Jennifer chuckling) And if you would just stop and think sometimes you'd realize that you overthink things. What is it that I overthink? (Barbra giggling) A lot of things. Like this. You're pregnant. Whoop di doodle do. It's about dang time at your age. (Jennifer scoffs) I.. Yeah, we are your family. I thought I'd never have grandchildren from you. In case you haven't noticed, you're not exactly the easiest person to open up to. I'm not even sure I wanna be a mother. And what does that mean? You're gonna have an abortion? Mom, okay, I think you've had enough. Oh, no. In fact, I'm gonna have more. - Of course she is. - Mom. No. I've tried to ask you. - No! - Give it to me. - No, do not take that- - Come on, Mom. - Give it to me, come on! - Don't take it! [Jennifer] Hey! - I'm sorry, Mom. - Don't you touch me Jennifer! Thanks. (fist knocking) Who the hell is that? - (dramatic music) - Mom, what are you doing? This'll work. - Oh, God. (Barbra chuckling) If those little fuckers wanna play. (Barbra cackling) We're gonna play. Oh, yeah. I'm coming, darling. (light dramatic music) - Mom. - Little fuckers! Come out, come out wherever you are! [Stacy] Mom, get back inside. [Barbra] Olly olly oxen free. Which one of us is going after her? Come out, come out wherever you are. Olly olly oxen free. (Barbra chuckling) Come on, you thought you were gonna scare me. Ha, I'm gonna give you the scare of a lifetime time. (suspenseful music) Seriously? - Hello! - Mom. (Barbra laughing) - Kind of early. - Oh, my God. (suspenseful music) Mask! There's a guy in a mask! - A man! - Okay, Mom. Come on, we need to get you to bed. (Barbra shrieking) Come on. There's a man! - Mask! - You've had way too much. - No, he has a mask! - Let's go. Need help? - I got it! - Okay. (eerie music) [Manny] You know something that bothers me? This world has gone crazy despite so many wanting to be heroes. I think what this world needs is more monsters. (suspenseful music) - Come on, Mom. - There was a man. - Okay, come on. - Here. [Stacy] Let's just get you to sleep. It's the alcohol talking, okay? Okay. Lie down. Oh, I need to quit drinking. Please tell your sister I'm just so, so sorry. [Stacy] I will. [Barbra] I just worry about her so much. (Barbra sighs) I've done everything I know to do to get her help. - (somber music) - I know. Just go to sleep. Why do you think I drink so much? I've lost your father, Jennifer's a mess. You're my only success. I love you so much. Oh, I need to sleep. Oh, the room is spinning, Stacy. Oh, my gosh. (Barbra sighs) - Good night, Mom. (somber music) (Stacy sniffling) (rattling) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) (eerie music) - Hello? (Claire panting) [Claire] Help! Claire? Claire is that you? (Claire panting) Where are you Claire? [Claire] Help! Okay, I can't help you unless you tell me where you are. Okay, where is close, Claire? Claire, tell me- (door creaking) - Who was that? (light dramatic music) Claire. Claire who? Claire Owens. That's who called earlier wasn't it? No. Then who was it? It was someone looking for Claire. Why didn't you tell me that? 'Cause I didn't want you to do what you're doing now. God, this girl is missing. She needs our help. [Stacy] What did she say? Where's Mitch? I don't know. - Aren't you worried? - Of course. What are you doing? I'm calling 911. Something smart people woulda done a long time ago. (Jennifer sighs) [Operator] 911, what's your emergency? Hi, this is Jennifer Carter, I'm calling about some girl that I think is in danger. Yeah, yes, it's 5115 Stone Shower Lane. Um, Claire. Um, it's Owens, Claire Owens. Hello? Yes, that's correct. (light dramatic music) (muffled talking) Okay, I will. Um, no, no, I'm here with my sister, her husband and my mom. Thank you, thank you. What did she say? She said she's sending an officer and to stay in the house till he gets here. - (both sigh) - Good. Oh, God. How's mom? - She's sleeping. (somber music) I don't know where that shove came from. It's been a while since I felt like the little sister. Thanks for sticking up for me. Hey, why don't you lay down on my bed. You can rest. That way you don't have to disturb mom. And I'll let you know when the cops get here. Okay. Thank you. You know what? I don't feel so alone with you in there. (Jennifer sighs) (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) (tape ripping) (eerie music) (Axle hushes) (Barbara groaning) Don't speak. I know what you're thinking and I don't need a reason. I will make it hurt. (Barbra crying) Does my voice turn you on? Does the touch of this cold steel excite you? (Manny panting) - You like when people watch? - No, no! - I know you don't. - No. You try to pretend to be a whore, but yet you're a prude inside. [Barbra] Help, help! I kiss the feet and bless this instrument of pleasure for your destruction. (Barbra gasping) (Axle cackling) Ashes to ashes, dust to lust. Were some of those song lyrics? Closest thing I got to poetry. You think Promise will like this? You know our girl likes props. (gravel crunching) (sirens wailing) (suspenseful music) (light dramatic music) (car door slamming) (girl giggling) [Officer] Hey, police! (girl giggling) Hey! Who are you? (girl crying) Miss? Who are you? Miss! (suspenseful music) Turn around and put your hands in the air where I can see 'em Freeze! (dramatic music) What? (flesh squishing) (girl giggling) (suspenseful music) Mom? Mom? Mom, you awake? Mom, I'm really sorry about what happened earlier. (suspenseful music) - (woman screaming) - No, no! Mitch still isn't back. I'm seriously worried about him. This isn't like him at all. What the hell! What are you watching? (dramatic music) (man groaning) It's one of those DVD's mom bought. I couldn't find anything else. This looks real. Yeah, I can't watch any of 'em. They're pretty much the same. [Manny] Try to not lose 'em. - Action! - You should run. - Look out, go! (woman screaming) They're all pretty much the same. People getting killed by a group of psychos. Stacy this looks like a snuff film. (woman screaming) (stick thudding) (woman screaming) (dramatic music) Snuff film? Yeah, you know, movies where they do real life murders. Ew. Finally I can lay my head on something that's real- - How do you even know what that is? - Look I- - You know what? I don't even wanna know. - I'm taking this out. - Wait! - What? - Oh, I've longed for it. Really something that's real. (suspenseful music) - Stop, what do you see? - Oh, I love it. You're freaking me out. Have you even tried to watch this? No, like I said, it's too graphic for me. Do you recognize anyone? Honestly, I can't think about anything else right now besides Mitch- - Stacy, look at the movie! - For what? Oh, I love it, really. You know, sometimes I wonder if you know me better than I know myself. - Oh shit. (Axle cackling) That's- That's who? That's him. (suspenseful music) Oh the pieces, the pieces. The many pieces. (Axle cackling) That's him. That's the guy that came looking for Claire? Yeah, that's him, Jenny. That's him for sure! (fist knocking) (Axle laughing) - It's them. - Okay, stay calm, stay calm. - (fist pounding) - Go away! (Axle laughing) Where the fuck are the police? I'll call 'em again, okay? What if they got to Mitch? Okay, listen to me. I need you to stay calm, okay? Listen. Can you do that for me? Okay. I need you to go wake up mom. She probably knows where dad hides his hunting guns, okay? Just... Hello? Hello? Damn it! (eerie music) Come on, come on, come on. Okay. Mom, Mom, get up. (suspenseful music) (Stacy gasps) Mom! Get up, Mom. Mom! (light dramatic music) (eerie music) Jenny, Mom's dead. No, no, don't- - Jenny, we have to leave right now. Don't tell me that. - How, how did they do it? - We have to leave! [Jennifer] Oh, shit. My fucking battery died. (eerie music) Okay. Okay, we, we, we have to get out of here. (keys jingling) Um, okay. Listen to me, listen to me. Okay, we are gonna make a run for it, okay? - Okay. - Okay, we're gonna run straight to the car and I don't want you to stop for anyone or anything. Do you understand me? - I understand. - Okay. - I love you. - I love you too. Okay, come here. It's okay. (both sniffling) We're gonna make it, okay? Look at me, okay? Ready? (suspenseful music) (door creaking) Go, go, go. Go, go! (both screaming) (eerie music) [Stacy] Mitch. Mitch, Mitch! - Stacy! - Mitch! - Get in the car. - No, I can't! Run! Night night. (knee thudding) (dramatic music) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) Well, do I look like Barney Fife? It's time. (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (boots thudding) (boots tapping) (eerie music) Stacy. Stacy. Stacy! - Stacy! - Mitch. Mitch, wake up. Mitch. Why are you doing this to us? (Manny hushes) Quiet on the set. - Baby, is that you? - It's me. I'm here. Hey, no matter what happens, I love you. (Promise chuckling) I love you too. Aw, isn't that sweet. [Jennifer] You get your hands off her! Again, quiet on set! All right, everyone. We are looking for this to be our Oscar moment. Places! Camera ready? Action! (hands clapping) What does he mean action? (suspenseful music) (light dramatic music) Where were you on the date of January 12, 1985? What? January 12, 1985! - Where were you? - God! I don't know what you're talking about. That's my fucking birthday! I was a fucking baby! What happened? What, what do you mean? Is that my journal? I ask the questions here. What happened when you were born? I don't know what you mean? Would you say that you're a different person than you were a little girl? Please just stop. - Leave her alone! (Stacy crying) (Axle sighs) Maybe this'll help. (flesh squishing) (Mitch groaning) - (Jennifer crying) - Please stop. Stop, stop. Just stop, okay? I'll answer. Just don't hurt him. Please. [Manny] Are you happy? - No. - Why? - I don't know. - Yes you do. No, I don't know! Please. Please. (flesh squishing) (Mitch groaning) (Stacy screaming) [Stacy] No! [Jennifer] I don't know who I am anymore! (Jennifer crying) Leave her alone, you can harass me. No, no. Stacy you have your whole life ahead of you. So do you. You have a baby. Watch out. Whatever you say I will use against you. [Manny] Tell me about life, Jenny. I see what y'all are doing. You all look at life like a reel onto some projector that just goes round and round. These lives that you're taking are just performances to you. Am I right? That's right. You want an escape, am I right? You just want to be free, right? More than anything. You found us like we found each other. Life is too short to not feel free. You can be anybody you want with us. What exactly are you saying? We all came from somewhere, Jennifer. Is that, is that what you did to Claire? Is she your prisoner now? [Axle] We didn't kidnap her. She came to us. I thought you wanted to go home? [Manny] She does. [Promise] Come here. Wait, what is she doing? [Promise] Remember there's no place like home. - No, wait. - Please, please don't. - Please, please don't. - Stop, please don't. - Please don't, please. (Stacy screaming) - No! (Axle chuckling) (Jennifer grunting) (flesh squishing) Finally, I'm free. (Jennifer grunting) (flesh squishing) (Jennifer crying) (light dramatic music) You always had the power to go home. (Jennifer gasping) Now, click your heels and off you go. [Manny] And cut. There's the real Jennifer. I found you. How? How are... [Stacy] These people, this whole thing. I did this because I didn't know how else to get through to you. The real you. Take my hand. Come on. This is our home now. This is where we belong. (light dramatic music) (light music) (suspenseful music) (water splashing) - Hi. - Hey there. - What's your name? - Carrie. [Jennifer] Hi, Carrie, I'm Hope. - That's a pretty name. - Thank you. Can I touch her? - I don't see why not. - What's her name? - Barbra. - She's cute. She is isn't she. So, what are you doing out here all alone? Kids were making fun of me back at the house. So, I left and I'm never going back. Well, don't listen to those assholes. (Carrie giggling) What's so funny? You said assholes. [Jennifer] Yeah, I did, didn't I? (Jennifer giggling) She likes you. (light dramatic music) Carrie, what are you doing over here? [Carrie] I was talking to this woman, Miss Stone. I'm sorry if she was bothering you. I wasn't bothered at all until you came along. - (Miss Stone scoffs) - Come on. You need to learn how to button your jacket, little girl. Gosh, I don't know how many times I've told you not to the leave the house alone. (Miss Stone sighs) You're in big trouble when we get home, missy. Ouch. - Why are you smiling? - Look? - Action! (suspenseful music) (Miss Stone screaming) (flesh squishing) (dramatic music) (funky upbeat music)
