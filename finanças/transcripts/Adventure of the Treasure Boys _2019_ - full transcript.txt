Boom! - Whoa! - Whoo! - Holy cowpie! - Holy. - Ooh! - Oh gee. - Oh, oh dang. - Oh dang. - Oh! - Oh no! - What the? - Run! - This is a story of Tony and Vinny who've been trying to figure out the clues to a treasure that I buried in the woods, a long time ago. - 'Sup, Ton? - 'Sup, Will? What you doin'? - What you doin'? - 'Sup? - 'Sup? - Changing my tires, got a flat. - Bytheway, my name is Uncle Davey and I was a stunt man in the movie business and Tony and Vinny are my nephews. This time, Tony is quite sure he has it all figured out. - Vinny! I think I got it. No, I'm sure I got it and tonight's the night. Full moon and everything. - Yeah, right. I just wanna know one thing, will we still be young when this happens? - Geez, Ton, you said that 50 times now, I mean, how old are we gonna be before you really figure this out. - Well, it's your birthday, Vin. - Well, I, guys, had to double-check it and everything. Come have a look. - Holy smokes, dingledorf! It's my birthday! I thought you said it was just a simple triangle. - Well, yeah, it's a triangle, but not so simple. It's kind of like the Egyptian pyramids in 2659 B.C. Times three equal sides of a perfect triangle equals your birthday backwards! It has to be right! Uncle Dave always said your birthday was a golden moment. - Tell me how it works. - Well, not now. It's a little complicated. It's math, out of your bandwidth, and you've got baseball practice. Where's that box of cleats? - The loft. - You get goin' before Coach Thaw gets his knickers all wadded up. I'll get Dad's lights down at camp and get it set up. Come on. - Right in the hole! Move! Yeah! Come on in, guys, come on, guys. Hustle. Let's go. Hustle in, let's go. Hustle hustle hustle hustle! Put your gloves and balls right here in the middle and circle it up. Let's go, let's go, go. Let's go, come on now! Hustle hustle hustle hustle. We're a team, let's go! On the count of three! On the count of three. One two three! - I don't wanna do this. - Guys don't break! - Okay, guys. You get the purpose of this exercise? - Yes, coach! - Yes, coach. - You're only as good as the weakest link. Don't let your teammates down. You guys are doin' great! We're in the playoffs next weekend, boys! We're still underdogs. We've come a long long way, boys. It ain't over yet. Keep it up! Hands in! Mike's ready? - Mike's! - Vinny. You know why I gave you that look? You let your grades down! Your mom said "No grades, no baseball." Are you gonna let your teammates down? - Nope, I'll get my grades up, Coach. - Good boy, Vin. Exactly what I wanted to hear. Okay, J.D. said you're having a sleepover tonight. - Yep. - Okay, after dinner, I'll bring J.D. over. You boys have fun, now. - Finally! - Whoo! - Okay, guys! Treasure hunt's on! Cowboy up to the Farm Boy. Last one there buys a Coke! - Hey guys, don't forget, I got fireman handicap. - All right, let's see. Sundial, mirror, compass, tape measure, 20 feet of nylon line, large earth magnets, level, shovels, six sticks, flashlight, that's it! - The treasure came from a boxing match that I was betting on against the mobster world long time ago. Well, lucky me, I won! They lost, but ever since they've been trying to get their money back. - Oh! Hey Hailey. What can I get for you? - A hamburger and some ice, please. - Okay. Here we go. Have a nice day! - What? You've never seen a horse in a drive-in? - Look at that '68. - Oh my goodness. - Hey guys, sorry I missed practice. Happy birthday, Vin. - Hey, what's up? Hey, no one's got fries. - What's with the fry? - Hey! - Bring it. - Oh hey Melissa! You busy tonight? - I thought you'd never ask. Dinner and cartoons at your place? - No no, not for me. For Tony. He wanted to know if you'd like to come by after work for our treasure hunt. - Be careful, Vinny. You never know who's listening. - Oh me, Tony, and you, and J.D. - And who are you taking? - Oh! - Oh no, it's not like that. It's a real treasure hunt. Our Uncle Dave buried some gold in the woods 20 years ago. And Tony, - Wanted to know if I would like to go into the woods with him and find it? - Melissa? Can I please get the check, I really gotta go. - Nope. Coach Style called and said Happy Birthday. - Hey guys, Coach is buying! - We all knew about it, Happy Birthday, Vin! - Okay, I gotta go back to work, but happy birthday. - Whoa! - Feel the love! - Okay, peoples, here's to Uncle Davey's treasure. - Hip hip - Hooray! - Okay listen up. Tonight's the seventh full moon and we're gonna dig up Uncle Dave's treasure. - What about the Marshalls in Kay Park? I told my parents that I-- - Just who we's been lookin' for. Little treasure hunters, eh? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? - Yo, cousin Paulie, last time you did the thinkin' I did 10 days in jail. - Yo cuz, no disrespect, but I told you not to take Jimmy the Nose with yous on that job. I wanted the Penzatti boys from the old neighborhood. They never got caught doin' nothin' over there. What's the older one's name, Mr. Big Magnet? - Nah, it was the Matleon brothers. Little Mikey had a paper route, Big Tom had a pizza Pawn shop. They mades quick pizzas over there, unbelievable. - Sisters are gonna keep a fire going? - Yeah, they're girl scouts, dude. They've been camping plenty of times. What are you thinking, man? Who else is gonna do it? - Okay, okay. Okay, we'll meet Will at the shop. - I gotta get my bag. - Can I go? I'll be the lucky one to find the treasure. - Yo, Bobo, One-speed, you're goin' home. - Remember what Dad said about payback when I fixed your tire? Vinny can I use your phone? - Okay okay, you can go One-speed. - You, - Yo, they're giving us the slip. Let's blow this pop stand, right. - All right go farm boys! - We're watchin' 'em! - Vinny, pick up the phone. - Hello? - Vinny, first off, Ray left his bag. Second, those two bugs sitting behind you are following you. - Pull a dog poop, gotta go! Hey guys, don't look back, some guys are following us. Let's get out of here! - Ahh! - Go go go! - Hey, they're catching up, go go go! - Oh! - Yeah, wait 'til we get our hands on you. You wait, just wait! You wait! - Coming! - What's up, Will? - Hey. - How's it goin'? - How we doin' man? - You could've waited guys. - Sup. - Oh geez. - Okay, Tris, oh yeah, okay. You can drive the gator up there. - What what? - And I'll drive the big tractor over there, you know? Just in case we get tired of digging, Vinny. - Thanks, let's get it on William. - Yeah! Let's get 'er done. - See you boys up there. - Whoa! - Fire on that! Fire on the ground! - Hi Mom! - Hey Vin! - Hi Gran! - Hi daddy, how are ya? - Good. - Did you have a good practice today? - Yep. - All right, you batted left and right? - Yep. - All the kids are waiting. You still need to get something to eat and change your clothes. - I stopped at the Farm Boy, coach treated us. - Oh okay, sweetie. Not get goin'! Those pants are finished. I'm not sure I can fix 'em one more time. We're so broke. Everybody we know is goin' broke or losin' their homes. We, but not corporate America. And they move out of country? Who's bailing us out? - Hm. - You'll be all right. I think it'll be all right after tonight. I really do. You'll be all right. - You really believe Uncle Dave buried his treasure down there? - I don't know, but I know they're having a swell time down there. They'll be shootin' off firecrackers, blank guns, and all matter of noise, it'll be great. Right? - What? - Well, thought I told ya. IF they find the treasure then they're going to celebrate. Listen, I called Charlie down at the fire department, I told Charlie. Okay? He'll know it's the kids. Everything will be fine. - You're worse than Uncle Dave. - Oh no, I'm not worse than Uncle Dave. Uncle Dave's the one that taught them to shoot the blanks in the Western gun. - I have to work in the morning. Are you gonna stay up with them and keep things under control? - I'm right here. I'll be stayin' right here. - I don't like this. - Can you please fix these, Mom? - I don't like this, Vincent. - Well of course you don't. I'm sittin' right here. Now you go on to bed before I have to spank you like a 12 year-old runaway. - Okay, Pa. - All right dear, good night. Good night, darling. - You behave. - Right on, Daddy? - Right on, Grandfather. - Now, unless you find the treasure, okay, there'll be no celebratin' down there, you hear me? Or I'll flog you within an inch of your life. You get my drift? Sir? - Indeed I do, sir. When we find the treasure, no ifs about that. - Right-O, daddy, on your way. He he he. - Geez, Vin. Vinny, you have outdone yourself. - Isn't it swell? Uncle Dave must've used it in his movies. Little big. Pretty cool, huh? - We think it looks cool, Vinny. - Yeah, very cool. - Why thank you, ladies. - What about you Danny? Where's your dad's cop uniform? - Okay, I got it. Where can I change? - Don't worry, ain't nobody lookin'. Okay, peoples. Tony and I have been saving Tony's money. We want to thank you all for helping so we got you each a genuine black knife made right here in Idaho just for campin' and whittlin'. Here you go, Danny. - Okay, okay. Listen up. These are the clues for finding Uncle Dave's treasure. - Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, Ton, some guys from the Farm Boy tried to follow us. I think we should booby trap the place in case someone want to try some monkey business. - What? You intern! Sometimes you're dumber than a dirt shovel. What do you mean "tried to follow"? - Well, we sort of put 'em in a ditch. - You should have seen 'em, Ton. We took 'em down the ditch beyond Farm Boy and they crashed their motor. - That's nice. They must have heard you talking or they wouldn't have followed you in the first place. I wonder who else heard you? Okay, well you guys all love making booby traps, so you can go booby trap the place. After we get an approximate location on the treasure. - Hey Vinny, how about those sling shots we made with inner tubes? - Oh yeah, okay then. Ray, Danny, Tristen, Will, Beau, Tyler, and I will go rig the joint. - What about me? I wanna go. - Aw, Diesel, this is manly men stuff. Girls keep the fire going. Okay boys, let's get 'er done! - Hey, hold it pee-wee. Forgettin' somethin' here? - Oh whoops. - Okay, in the seventh month when the moon is full, from the pit of grandma's grave, go due east using your compass into the forest 264 feet nine inches. Is that inches or centimeters? Oh well, anyway. If you have done all the calculations right, this is where we will find the treasure. Okay, guys, on any other night these clues aren't gonna work so we have to find the treasure tonight or wait an entire year for the seventh moon. Is everybody ready? - Yeah! - All right, boys, let's get 'er done. All right, Danny, you got the fireworks and stuff? - Vin, I got all the. - I got some great ideas you guys. - All right, whoever wants out follow me! - While Vinny and the boys are preparing for any possible intruders, Tony and his crew is trying to find the location for the treasure. - Dude, you guys, we have to make that trip line. - Okay, come on. - All right, right here. All right J.D., I want you to get Laney tape and Laney, I want you to go 264 feet nine inches. Girl scout. Oh and Breanna, you know how to use the compass? - Well, it's not exactly like the Arcos in my bag, but I guess I could go low-tech. Oh, I also have a sextant, but I ain't no Chris Columbus. - Do you want to dig up the entire forest? - No! You think it's that far off? - Well it could be. How 'bout we just use both? - When was that antique calibrated, Tony? - Touche, madame. Oh, let's get the sextant out. No, no, I'm kidding. Can we just cut to the chase here, we're burning daylight. - What about me? - Well, you wanna dance with a shovel? - No, but I wouldn't mind a dance with you. - Come on, Laney. Let's go, girl. - Dude, she's cute! - She's a redhead and a bit young, don't you think? - So? And? You don't like redheads? - There's a saying, Red Red peed the bed blamed it on a cabbage head. - What? That's messed up, dude. - I'm just sayin'. - Come on, Laney, while I'm still young if you don't mind, stop drooling over Tony and just get over here. - I'm already here, Brianna. - Okay, now what? - All right. Let's make a big circle here so Pee Wee and his boys don't rig this area. - I got it, Ton. - All right, thanks. - Okay, Ton, are you gonna play football this year? - No, no basketball is more my game. - Mack, that's gonna mit, my dad's coaching! I guess we'll see you then! - All right I'm gonna go get Pee Wee. Vinny! Vinny where are you? Get over here! Vinny where are you? - What's up, Ton? - Okay, does everyone see this circle? This is where we're gonna start so don't go rigging this area. - Okay, Ton. - Oh and when you're done, come back over and check in. - Copy that, Ton. - All right, go get 'em. - Same to you. - Right here, let's trace that-- - Yeah so, this is me, this is Vinny, this is Tristen.

Okay, bye. - Hey, Vin, I'm gonna head down and get dinner. - Can I go? - Blackfoot is almost as good as-- - What's up, dude? - I'm gonna go ask grandpa to take me to get dinner. - How you gonna do that? I think he's sleeping. - Well, I'll have to go wake him up. - Can't they deliver? - Nope, they're busy. - Can't you call a taxi? - That's funny, you been watchin' way too many movies, Intern. - Hey Ton, I can't dance and I can't sing, but I can ride shotgun. - All right, let's go. - Anyway, Tristen got his little Trail 90, oh my gosh. - Gran! - Ah! Dunphry Daniels, what's up boys? - Well, we were just wondering if you could take us down to the Farm Boy, 'cause we ordered some burgers and they can't deliver. - Well, you must be kiddin' me. - What? - Yes yes yes! - That's just once. If you're not back in 20 minutes, I'm gonna call the cops. - Uh oh. - Geez, ol' Gramps. I'm on a learner's permit. I'm supposed to have an adult after dark. - Well, just tell 'em when you left, Gramps was in the back and he must have fallen out somewhere. - Aw come on, Gramps, I can't. - You know, Billy Westbrook'd be proud of you boys, I was just testin' you. All right? Come on I'll take you, let's go. - Yeah, yeah! - Hey, look! Tony's not supposed to drive at night alone!

Go on, get him up there. - Come on, Beau. - I think we're being followed. Two funny guys followed us from Farm Boy. - Where we goin' over here, where's this guy goin? - The treasure, remember the treasure? We're following them looking for the treasure. I'm not exactly whistling past a graveyard, Paulie. - And neither am I. - We gotta get this money, we gotta get outta here. I need this money. - We both do, but where's this guy going? He's driving all over the place. - Two funny guys followed us from Farm Boy. - Oh Vinny. Him and his big mouth. - I heard one of those little whipper snappers say to the other one they're gonna make a left at the cattle guard. The cattle guard. - Cattle guard? What kind of uniform's he gonna be wearing? - I never met a cattle guard, I don't know who these people are. - You want me to drive? Okay, Ton, ready? - Okay. - Whoops, almost slipped in that dog poop. - Whoa look at this guy. - Unbelievable, what's up with these people? - Hope that cop didn't see that. Okay, there we go. All right, I got the gas, what are you doin'? You're trying to drive again? - Yeah, uh-huh. - Sit up, sit up. You're gonna fall over. - I have an idea. Mom calls me her little mud magnet. - Bet I can guess why. - Betcha can't. - You're just like Vinny. You can't pass up a perfectly good mudhole without bathing in it. - Oh you're talking about Brian and Amy's place up there, ain't ya? Do they flood irrigate their fields? - Yeah, uh-huh. - Oh I see. - Oh, I see what he's got in mind. - People are unbelievable. Where's he? He's driving all over the place Where's he going? - I don't know, Paulie, but we're gonna get this money and we're gonna get outta here. - Okay, here we go. Let's hit the mud. - Oh this is good. - Hold up, we're stuck! Look! - Ooh. - What's goin' on around here? - Oh, Hey, what are you guys following us for? - We were thirsty, we're looking for a bar, thought you might be able to help. - Oh yeah and pigs can fly. - Oh this kid with a smart mouth up here. - Come on guys, we know who you are.

Well, you putz! - If I get out of this mud, kid, that's it, you're goin' for a swim. - We gotta go. - All right, I'm stuck. - Your mom's gonna spank you in the pants when you get home. - Hey! Whoa! - Let's go. - Don't tear those bags. - Thanks, Gramps. - Hey, have a good time tonight, okay? - All right. - And if you get any trouble, you know where I am. - Okay. Pass those down. - We thought you were driving and grandpa sleepin'. - So cool. - Thanks. - We did get to drive and we lost those same two guys that followed us earlier, Vin. - No way, Holmes. - Yeah, I'm afraid so. - Beau, the same two, are you sure it was them? - Absolutely positively cross my heart hope to die. It was them, they followed us until we left them covered in mud by Bryan and Amy's place. - Awesome! - Well, I think it's the last time we'll be seeing them tonight, but, heck we got some time to kill, let's eat. This one has cheese on it. - I'd be careful, mine's gooey. - Anybody else's handle getting hot? - I know! sat on grandpa's lap and Uncle Dave's map - Gonna happen tonight, is it Uncle Davey? - I know! - Nice Luke! traps on the ground in the heart of the woods - Ah! - Don't you ever do that again! - Well, my mother does it for me, because, - Bear in tennis shoes a great big bear - He said to me - He said to me - Why don't you run? - Why don't you run? - Because you ain't - Because you ain't - Got any gun - Got any gun He said to me why don't you run?

I just wish we could hear 'em. - You know these people've been good to us, they pulled us out of the mud. They told us where the kids was at. - Whoa, what are you goin' soft on me? - Nah, let's go get the treasure. - I got a better idea, let them dig up the treasure, then we'll take it from 'em. - This isn't funny, come out with your hands up. - What happened, Jace? - I fell down goin' potty. - Gee whiz, Jace, that would've killed an ordinary man. - Yes it would, thank you very much. - Hey Ray, least we know the booby traps work. - Yeah. - Dude, I think there's someone definitely out there. - Well, since I'm the cop tonight, I'll go out and check you wussies. - Well, I'm not scared or anything, I'm just a little concerned for the ladies. - I got a good feelin' about this.

I don't know if you could do it, I got the original Salama Ducci suit, it's designed to do this kind of thing. - What's the matter with you? You never cease to amaze me. - Let me go, let me go! Let me go. - Hey, we could do this the easy way or the hard way, which way is it gonna be? - The hard way is you goin' in the Hudson River with some lead slippers on. Hear that? - Where's the rest of your boys? - Where are they? You're going for a swim in the East River. You don't look like Flipper, di di di di di di. Ah! Come on!
