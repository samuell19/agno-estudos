Yee haw! Yee haw! Yee haw. My god, June. Don't you ever quit? Not until I have what I want. Look, I told you. I'm not going to discuss or make a decision on the topless calendar until I see how the tour goes. That's six months, baby. My career could be over by then. I need the exposure now. Mm. Well, I think maybe we could work something out. Yeah? Yeah. Mm. Pig Hollow, population 101. That's me driving. I'm Bob Bob. I'm the smart one. It's April, May, and June. It's the Three Seasons girls. Don't they just make your mouth water? Them city girls don't give a lick about us country boys, especially those that run moonshine. When are you going to get that through your thick skull? But Bob Bob. The idiot sitting next to me, that's my brother, Joe Bob. He's the reason we got into this whole mess. You'll hear about that soon enough. Ah. Some folks might say selling moonshine is a dangerous business, especially when low down farmers like the Jackson brothers try to get a piece of the action. Ugh. What are we going to do now? We should start giving them stuff. Never. No one gets our moonshine. Normally, we're peaceful folk here in Pig Hollow. But when the Jackson brothers threaten our lives and our moonshine, that's going a bit too far. And something else is even more dangerous-- women. Put that away, Joe Bob. Can't you see you're getting us killed right now? But Bob Bob, this is a new issue. Oh, lord. Hold on, girls. Did we make it? Oh, open your eyes, you baby. I swear, sometimes I can't believe you're my brother. Of course we made it. We always make it. No thanks to you and them Three Seasons girls. Ahh! Ugh. Oh, them thieving bastards, I'll just kick their butt. Say that when them boys is awake, and I might believe you. Well, just get it going then. Well, to be on the safe side, we'd better take the shortcut through Ghost Gulch. Ghost Gulch, we can't go through there. It's haunted, you know that. Them boys is going to be awake any minute. It's our only chance. Ghost Gulch it is then. I'd do anything for my gals. Well, looky here. Couple of jailbirds. Howdy, Sheriff. Now, far off in that crazy city folks call Hollywood, the Three Seasons girls, or the ones Joe Bob's so crazy about, are getting ready to make a new calendar. Already, it would take a saint to resist what these girls got. Looking good, let me see you a little bit. Good, good. Perfect, perfect, perfect. Let me see a little bit more. Keep your chin up just a little bit higher. Perfect. All right, there you go. All right. Oh, beautiful. Let me see you a little bit more. OK, perfect, perfect. This one's June. June, let me see you. There you go. April. Get yourselves together just a little bit more for me, OK? Let me see you all together. Perfect. There you go. Oh, oh, yeah. There you go. Perfect, April. Work. Dang. Beautiful, beautiful. OK. Keep your chin up a little bit more. Oh, yeah, great. Great. Oh my god. All right, May, June, why don't you two take five and let me finish this roll with April? Where was I anyway? Oh. Oh, yeah, May. Ah. This one's April. She's the leader of the group, and she's just as sweet as can be. Let me see you, sweetheart. How's this, David? That's great. That's great. Little did these girls realize fate was about to deal them an interesting hand. Hi, baby. How's it going? Don't hey, baby me. When are you going to tell April about us? Well, you know I can't do that just yet. We've got the calendar deal and the tour coming up. Once the tour is over, then-- No! Although April is my best friend, I am sick of her getting all the attention. It's time for me to be in the spotlight. Not her. Shh, shh, now calm down. I promised I'd listen to your ideas, and I have. We'll just have to wait till-- If you say after the tour, I will kill you. Now either you tell her or I will. Oh. Oh, sorry, babe, I gotta go. Look, we'll talk about this later tonight, OK? Good luck with the shoot. Perfect, perfect, there you go. Oh, good. There you go. Come on. There you go. Perfect. Congratulations on that new calendar and tour deal, April. So when were you planning on telling us? Come on, smile. Tonight. Jeffrey still has to lock up the applications for the promotional tour. Hey, come on, all right? How did you know? Jeffrey just signed the contract today. Jeffrey told me last night in bed. I don't believe it. Well, believe it. Oh my god, you really are a bitch. Yeah, well, a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. Even sleeping with your best friend's boyfriend? Quite the coincidence, April. Your boyfriend happens to be our manager. Sleeping your way to the top there, June? You know, April has run the show for a little too long now. It's time we did things my way. But June, April only has our best interests at heart. Spoken like a true virgin. Pfft. You leave the virgin-- I mean May-- out of this. This is between you and me. Well, I don't think you've got what it takes. Try me. Come on, May. Let's get out of here. I never get to have any fun. Come on. I'll buy you some candy, all right? You're crazy. If you think that sleeping with Jeffrey is going to give you control over the Bikini Team, you're wrong. Then how come he's considering my topless calendar idea? What? That's right. He seems to think that the Three Seasons Girls Go Topless would be a number one seller. Well, Jeffrey is no fool. He knows the reason we're so popular is because we won't take our tops off. Well, then, I guess you haven't seen our recent sales figures lately, have you? Down by 20%. I don't care what the sales figures say. We have an image to protect. And we owe it to our fans. Yeah, well, our fans want to see us naked. And I'm the kind of girl who likes to give the guys what they want. Well, that's what everybody says. Shut up. Now just outside of Pig Hollow is that little haunted area they all call Ghost Gulch. Things have been pretty quiet around Ghost Gulch lately-- maybe too quiet. Wake up, Pappy. Things ain't going to be quiet for long, not with that ghost running around. Can't you keep quiet? I'm trying to read here. Here's to you, you old ghost. Come on, let's get out of here. This place gives me the creeps. - Me, too. Let's go. Boy, that Missy Sue sure knows how to work a gun. Guess I shouldn't be talking about Pappy's little girl like that. Scared of a little ghost, are ye? How about this? We'll be seeing a whole lot more of Missy Sue as this story goes along, and I do mean a whole lot more. Daggonit. Got off with a mess of chickens. That dang ghost is going to cost us this farm. Oh. I have to take another bath. That's two this week. If the Good Lord meant for us to wear clothes, you wouldn't have been born butt naked. Ghost or no ghost, Pappy better get them dang showers fixed. I'm tired of bathing in this here creek. You never know what nasty critters might be watching you. Now not too far away from that creek was an old house that got bought up by some young feller. Folks say he was an artist, but most folks just called him a hippie freak. Because it takes a whole lot of drugs to make someone buy a house right next door to a ghost. Wow, if I could only put a face on a haunting voice. Could that be you, my spirit goddess? It is you I've come here to see. Whoa. How can a mere mortal be worthy of such beauty? Mister, you talk like you're out of your head, but you sure are cute. Here's the reason they call this place Ghost Gulch. You ever hear of a haunted tepee before? Now you have. This here's the place of old Crazy Joe, an old Indian dead these many years past. His horrifying screams still fill the air. Yep. Unfortunately for that old artist hippie boy, it was all just a dream. But someday, if his dream was to come true, he'll soon be painting a masterpiece dedicated to Missy Sue. Sue, my sweet, soon, it'll be more than a dream. Well, after that dream, I can think of two things he's going to be painting. Shoot, some boys just have all the luck. Oh! I don't know. It's-- it's rain-- it's raining. Pa, I had to take a bath in that dang creek again. When are you going to fix that shower? Daggonit! That dang ghost does it to me again. Where's my jug? Taking your moonshine ain't all that fool ghost has done. 'Cause of him, the cows don't want to give no milk and the chickens don't want to lay no eggs. Since he started all this fussing, we ain't been able to make a dime. I mean, for years now, he ain't bother us none, you know? And now things are just disappearing right and left. Well, that ain't all. Them bank people done come around this morning. Before I could run them off, they just took some of the chickens. Here's-- here's-- here's one of them yet. Getting drunk ain't going to solve nothing. Well, I ain't trying to solve nothing. I'm just trying to get a little drink. Pa, I'm tired of being the only one around here who gives a dang about this place. I care. Pa, if we don't do something fast, we're going to lose Ghost Gulch for good. What are those two pathetic losers in for? Oh, I caught them with a load of illegal moonshine up near Ghost Gulch. Ugh, must you do that? Yep. Well, let's get down to business, shall we? Well, shoot. It's your party, Mr. Bank President. I'm just along for the ride. The deed to Ghost Gulch, have your men found it? No. Did find a couple of chickens, though. Ghost must've scared them off. That and the old man's daughter, she's pretty good shot. She doesn't suspect, does she? Calm yourself. My boys stuck to the back taxes story. Far as she knows, that deed's still hidden safe and sound. Well, you know, it ain't no big secret in this part of the country that whoever holds the deed to Ghost Gulch automatically becomes legal owner of the land. And maybe somebody just found it. No. This land is perfect for my needs. There's a deal with the government already in the works. They have got to find it. Well, you've got to find yourself some new idiots 'cause those old idiots ain't going back there no more. Don't tell me. Because of the ghost, right? You hillbillies are so predictable. Watch yourself. This hillbilly's got a gun. Oh, we'll find the deed all right. And I will be a millionaire, and Ghost Gulch will become the government's newest nuclear dumping site. Uh-huh. Yes, April. No, no, it will never happen again. I promise, April. And don't worry about May. She's OK. She just doesn't like it when you and June are upset. Oh, god. Oh-- oh, god, something just came up. I'm sorry, I gotta go. Bye bye. Hi. Hi. Well, that ghost don't seem to have hurt your appetite none. Move over, boy. Lord almighty, let it be there. The deed to Ghost Gulch has been here for years. I knew them bank people was looking for more back taxes. They want our ranch. You see anything up here, Bob Bob? Nope. How long we got to stay here anyway? I'm getting scared. Until we find that piece of paper that the Sheriff or Mr. Snively are looking for. I'm starting to itch something awful. Well, that's just too dang bad. If we don't find that deed, we're going to be going back to jail. Now I'm starting to itch, too. Oh, the girl ain't got it. Where did you get these leaves? Over there. One thing about the snooping business, it don't pay to hide in poison oak. We got so itchy, scratchy, we done left our binoculars and moonshine behind. Oh, I guess we'll never learn. Drop Mr. Fuzzy or you're dead. He's dropped. He's dropped. I'd forget I ever saw that if I was you. Of course. Now could you just put that thing away and attend to the matter at hand? What's on your mind, Snively? The deed, of course. Have those drunken idiots come up with anything? Nope. Because if I lose that deed, there will be hell to pay! Hey, Jeb. Keep an eye out for your sister, will you? I ought to tan your hide. Oh, come on, Missy Sue. We didn't mean nothing by it. And you better let me hold that bottle there because that stuff is flammable. Keep your grubby paws off of there. And you, no more of this fancy book learning until we find that deed. Um, Missy Sue, it'll turn up. He just done forgotten and put it somewhere else, or that ghost took it. You two just don't understand, do you? Somebody's after Ghost Gulch, and it ain't no spook! Well, it sounds like a spook. Far out, man. How many bikinis can they own? There's more! I had to ask. You better call, you bastard. June, come on, we're late. Well, Jeffrey, I told you I wouldn't stop until I get what I wanted. Maybe you'll believe me after this. Coming! June, have you seen the itinerary? Oh, yeah. It's right here. Ah, great. 'Cause you know, we wouldn't get very far without this now, would we? - Nope. Good, because my sense of direction really sucks. Now what that city boy didn't know was that sneaky June done switched the maps. I do believe that girl needs a good licking to straighten her act up right. I'm sorry, folks. I just got a mental picture in my head. You know what they say about bad girls. This isn't over yet. I can still ruin your precious tour. Call me. June. PS, you'll be sorry. I don't get it. Them binoculars was right here. I'm not saying I'm a superstitious fella. But something down deep told me that that ghost of Crazy Joe done stole our moonshine and our binoculars. What the ghost needs them for, well, we don't know. But we're going to try and find out. I've got it. I wouldn't sneak up on me like that if I was you. You're lucky you didn't get plugged. Put that down. While you were sleeping, I came up with a solution to our little problem, in case our drunken friends fail in their mission. We've been driving for hours. I don't want to be late for the first stop on the tour. You sure we're not lost? April, relax, all right? I've been following this map, and according to this, we should be reaching-- Pig Hollow? Is this legal? Extremely legal. Looks like Ghost Gulch has been having some financial problems as of late. Lucky for me, I still have connections at the IRS. Figures you'd be in tight with that bunch of jackals. By the time our little farm girl figures a way to pay up, Ghost Gulch will become the very next Three Mile Island. I don't get this. I mean, this map says we shouldn't be anywhere near Pig Hollow. But we are, and according to my calculations, that puts us about six hours behind schedule. You know, I can't prove this, but I'll bet you have something to do with this. Still holding a grudge. Excuse me, guys. All right. Speaking of holding it, maybe we all should make a little visit to the woods, huh? Well, you guys go on ahead. I have something I have to take care of first. Here, careful. Careful, careful, careful. All right, you two go over there, and I'll see you guys in a little bit, OK? Yes, I understand how you feel. I know the calendar and the tour are a package deal. But they must have broken down somewhere. That's all I can think of. Look, I promise you they'll make their next gig. Yes, sir, I know. Yes, thousands of dollars. Don't worry. You can count on me. God, god. What have I done? All right, try it now. No go. All right, I'm no mechanic, but it looks to me like someone has thrown a monkey wrench in the works. That sounds awful. I don't think I can go another step. Yes, you can. Come on, you can do it, OK? We've walked over eight miles already. There's still no sign of intelligent life. I know. It's going to be dark. What? You guys afraid of a little exercise? I knew it. Knew what? You switched the map. And then when we were in the woods, you fixed the van so it wouldn't run. Why, April, I would have to be crazy to do something like that. Oh, crazy with jealousy maybe. All right, girls. Girls, just stop it, all right? Fighting won't solve anything. I think I hear something. That sounds like a horse. There must be a farm nearby. I'll deal with you later. Oh, gentle beauty, why has thou forsaken me? Give me a sign, any sign that you still exist. Oh, thank you. Thank you. You'll see. You won't be sorry. I dedicate this masterpiece to you. What is that? I don't know. It sounds like Indian drums or something. Well, it certainly isn't Metallica now, is it? Well, whatever it is, we can't let it slow us down, so let's keep moving. Hey, excuse me. You have a death wish, Mister? Uh, look, don't shoot, all right? Our vehicle broke down just a few miles back up the road, and we just need to use your phone. Well, it looks like you out of luck because we ain't got no phone. Um, OK, then can you tell us where the closest phone within walking distance is? Nope. Nope? There ain't no closest phone. That would be about 25 miles into town at the sheriff's office. Uh, well, would you mind giving us a ride then? I wouldn't mind. Ah, great. Hands back up! I said I wouldn't mind. I didn't say nothing about having no automobile. All right, look. Our next appearance is in three days. And if we miss another gig, we are history. So isn't there any way that you could help us, please? Well, mister, maybe we can work something out. Ain't nothing I could do about it. Something spooked them out there. You got a gun. Why don't you use it? You can't do that, Snively. Why not? You're the Sheriff, aren't you? Yeah. Them boys said they'd rather serve their time than help you out. And they've got about 15 hours to go. You can try to convince them after that. Boys, I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. The only way Missy Sue could help these folks was to put them up for a night. Although she done put them in the ritziest accommodations available, them city folks didn't seem to appreciate it none. What time is it? I don't know. It's way too early. Quit hogging my hay. David, your hair is so matted. Don't you ever wash it? What was that thing in there? It's just Bertha. You folks sure are nervous. Here, put these on. And what is this? The latest in hillbilly couture? I think I'd rather wear my bikini. Just put it on. Ooh. How chic. I'm going to, you know, go over there. Ain't you never change clothes in front of a woman before? Oh, it's not that. I just, you know, would prefer to change inside if that's all right with you. You all right down there, boy? Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. I'll just take these. Oh, but mind Bertha. She's a little feisty this time of year, being it's mating season and all. Run! Run! Run! Come on, April, call. If that June screws up the calendar deal, I'll kill her! Pappy! All right, look, Missy Sue, I can explain the whole thing here. Oh. Are-- are-- are these the people that are going to help us find the deed? They don't look none too smart, Pappy. No. They may not look like much, but they all we got. This is all we got? They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks. This must be true, because as soon as we got out of jail, we was back in business again. Woo yeah, we got out just in time for a new shift. The moonshine business. But what we didn't know was that Snively and the Sheriff was back in business, too-- our business-- and ready to put us back in jail to get us to agree to help them with their evil plan to steal Ghost Gulch. Hey, you think old Snively's going to make us go back to Ghost Gulch? As long as we make our moonshine delivery, I don't care. Well, we finally lost them, but we got clean away. At least, that's what they led us to believe. Dang, there goes Snively. He done sniffed us out faster than a hound dog. I'd like to see old Snively's face right now. Me, too. I'd like to see him make us do anything. Me, too. My, my, my. Look what the Sheriff dragged in. Snively, these boys were too easy to find. After they lost us, I just went back to the bar and waited for them there. They're going to have to do some more time. But you know, since this is their second offense and they did try to flee and elude an officer of the law, I'm afraid they're going to be in here for a long, long time. Well, you know, I might be out of office before these boys see the light of day. Unless, of course, we can work something out. Back up in the hills, old Crazy Joe was back to being crazy again. He was burning up stuff he'd stolen from some folks. I hope nothing is important in them papers. I totally feel your pain, my beauty. Soon. Soon, I'll take it all away. Wow, this is, like, totally good. Well, our horse can't make it. She's too old. If'n you go by foot, you better take along a first aid kit. Them hills are deadly. Look, I don't want to get killed. I just want to find a phone. Well, the mail truck comes in about three days. You can probably get a lift then. That's three days. We have a gig in two days. So we really aren't going to make it. They'll have to cancel our tour. Isn't that what you wanted, June? What? Now you can do that topless calendar all by yourself. Because without this tour, the Three Seasons Bikini Team is through. But I didn't mean for-- well, really, I just-- Come on, Pa. Let's go find that deed. All right. Well, you know, we need a shovel or anything? But you've got to believe me. I didn't mean for this to happen. I ne-- I ne-- I've n-- never met a girl like you before. And I hope you never will again. Come on, let's go for a walk. Damn that June. If they mess up the tour, I'm ruined. If I only had a clue where they were. Do you think the others will miss us? Nah. Missy Sue is just looking for that stupid old deed. But isn't that important? You could lose the farm. I know this may sound crazy, but I don't much care about farming. This is what I care about. But this is your home. You should care about it. Don't gets me wrong. I love this place. It's just Missy Sue always been the one who gets the work done around here. I just always have bigger dreams, I guess. I think I've found my Mr. Right. Just where were you last night? Well, I can explain everything, Missy Sue. And where were you, May? David and I were worried sick about you. Well-- I don't suppose anyone was worried about me. Well? Well, Jeb and I were together, if you know what I mean. You mean-- Yeah, another virgin bites the dust? Goddangit! Make that two virgins. Boy, I was starting to worry about you, reading all that frou frou stuff. Now that we got all that out of the way, let's get going. We got a deed to find. Ahem. What is it, June? I'm sorry, April, for everything. Did you just say what I think you said? If you give me another chance, I promise I won't let you or the group down again. You mean I got my best friend back? For good this time. All right, writing up all this crybaby stuff. We got work to do. Come on, everybody. Pappy's going to fix the shower. Crazy Joe finally found a use for those binoculars. And one thing he learned is that city girls get dirty in a hurry. And ain't we the lucky ones for it? Pig Hollow? Oh, wait a minute. That's where they went. Boys, why don't you tell Mr. Snively what you told me this morning? I'm breathless with anticipation. Oh, well, um, uh-- We'd be willing to help you if you'd talk to the Sheriff about getting us out of here. I could do that. Not only do I need you to look for the deed, but the Sheriff needs your help with a little plan I've devised. You boys think you're up to it? Uh-huh. Excellent. Now this is what I want you to do. It didn't take Snively long to figure out he needed someone else to do his dirty work for him. Hold it right there, flower boy. I thought I'd find you up here. You that wacky artist bought the place that borders Ghost Gulch. I done some checking on you, son. I've come to find out that your craziness ain't all in your head. It might have something do with some wacky little weeds grow so fine up here. Now if'n you don't want your place to be subject to a search, I just suggest you cooperate with me and the boys. Get your hands behind your head. Joe Bob, Bob Bob, search. Things have never been the same since Woodstock. If'n you want your little secret to stay safe with me, you're going to have to do me a little favor, son. Important. Come to the old willows place right away. I didn't know anybody around here could write. I wonder who it is. Please, it's not ready for your eyes yet, my darling. What the devil is going on? And just who are you anyway? Just a humble artist in awe of your magnificence. Look, mister, I don't understand no French, so if you want to talk to me, you're going to have to speak English. I have something of great importance to show you. Can't it wait? Because I got something to show you, too. Really? Really. Now, we shall create art in its truest form. Oh, baby! As much is it saddens me, my dearest, I have been forced against my will to give this to you. Hm? Internal Revenue Service. Notice of repossession. Property tax due, $25,000. That does not sound good. Pig Hollow, here I come. Although I can't prove it, something in my gut tells me that Snively is behind all this. That's the president of the bank you were telling us about, right? Mm-hmm. And I'd be willing to bet that old Roscoe is in on it, too. Maybe you better call the police. Roscoe is the police. We ain't going to get no help there. We owe that money fair and square. Now they just sped up the process a little, that's all. The South is going to rise again. Pa, go put that away. OK. What can we do to help? For starters, keep looking for the deed. If we can find it before they do, we might stand a better chance. Well then, we have just looked everywhere for it. I can think of one place we haven't looked. You mean? Yes. Crazy Joe's. Crazy Joe's? Yes, over yonder. That's right. Tonight only, the girls appear topless. And you get first distribution on the photos. Location? Well, that's still a little hush hush. But I can tell you this much. It's in a town called Pig Hollow. Yeah. Listen, I'll call you back with all the details. Ciao. Why did that Sheriff have to go leave us out here by ourselves? You see anything yet? Not yet. There ain't no such thing as ghosts. There ain't no such thing as ghosts. So is this Crazy Joe guy after your property? Well, according to Pappy, an Indian by the name of Crazy Joe was the original owner of Ghost Gulch. When he died, he wrote in his will that his tepee was never to be torn down. Why? In case he came back from the dead, of course. And from the looks of things, he has. So that's why they call this place Ghost Gulch. And whoever possesses the original deed to the property becomes the legal owner of the land. Well, maybe that's why this Crazy Joe rumor is still around, is to keep people like Snively from trying to steal the deed. It ain't no rumor. It's real. Did you hear what I heard? Yeah. You know what that means. We run like hell? Yep. Jimmy, baby. Yeah, I know. I'm having a bad connection up here. Having trouble with my cell phone. But listen, the place, Ghost Gulch. The time, sundown. We're having us a bikini hoedown. Yeah, talk to you later. June, baby, if this topless idea of yours works, I might just spare your miserable life. Where the hell is it, Pig Hollow? Bingo. Girls, have I got a surprise for you. This is maddening. Yep. How could you let them lock themselves in there? Did. Obviously, they got the keys from somewhere. Yep, they got it from me. But I didn't let them have it. They had to work real hard. They even threatened Mr. Fuzzy. Maybe there is something to this ghost thing after all. It's about time I paid little Missy Sue a visit. She must be in need of some financial advice. I don't know which is scarier, you or the ghost. You need to ask? You boys got room for one more in there? Two of us? So what if my career is over? So what if my best friend slept with my boyfriend? So what if-- What if I join you? David. No, April, please don't try to stop me. But-- You know, I don't know if it's being out here in the country air or running from a ghost, but I just have to say this to you. I think I'm in love with you. What? I said I love you. It's about damn time. Hold it right there, city boy! Don't shoot. What do you want? I'll give you anything. My car? My house? My credit cards? You with the IRS? IRS? No. No. I'm with them. Jeffrey? You know this sneaky varmint? Yeah. I know him all right. You want me to shoot him for you? April. Not just yet. Let's see what he has to say for himself first. All right. But if'n you need me, I'll be just inside the house. Well, Jeffrey, to what do we owe the honor of your presence? Let me tell you all about it. Absolutely not. No. But you can't say no. We've got a contract. Well, contracts are made to be broken, just like relationships. April, sweetie, she means nothing to me. Nothing. Can it, Jeffrey. Ow. I could sue you for that. Now, here's the deal. We'll do your little hoedown on one condition. Name it. Baby, it's yours. You tell him, May. We keep 80%. What? You heard her. It's 80% or no deal, big boy. All right. All right, it's 80%. That comes to-- $50,184.62. No. Well, that's enough money to pay off the property taxes on Ghost Gulch, and plenty of money for us. Who knew taking our clothes off could be so rewarding? Come on, girl. We have a hoedown to put on. Yee haw! Oh, now we're looking good. Yes, don't it, Pappy? Oh, yeah. Whoa. Nice. You did it. Yeah. We were planning to sleep it off safe and sound in our little cozy jail cell, away from the ghost and Snively. But once again, fate was about to stick out a foot and trip us up. Mr. Fuzzy don't like people sneaking up on him. My beauty, my beauty, I'm going to save her. Please, hear me out. Wake up, boys. Get a load of what we've got here. You. Who, me? June. You seen Miss June? I seen them. We got to save them together. Are them girls in trouble? Big trouble. They're the ones I've been telling you about, Bob Bob. If that Miss June or any of them Three Seasons girls in trouble, you can sure count on me. Come on, Sheriff Roscoe, what do you say? Haven't you done done enough for that low down skunk Snively? Please? Well, it looked like the hoedown was going to schedule. The Three Seasons girls were going to make enough money taking them off them tops to pay off the mortgage on Ghost Gulch and have enough money for themselves besides. Ah, that's some nice work if you can get it. Get on in here. Listen, you guys are going to love this. This whole topless thing, my idea. I'm going to make you guys millions! Here we go, come on in here and get it. Jeb, get up in here. Go get it. Come on, honey. Let's drink one ourselves. Thank you, Pa. Now, here. The moment y'all been waiting for-- the one, the only Three Seasons Bikini Team! What the hell? Who's there? I know someone's there. Show yourself, man. Please don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! Crazy Joe? Now you all don't pay me no never mind. I ain't fixing to ruin your party or nothing. I just kind of fell off the wagon for a spell. I done must have hit my head pretty hard, too, because I've been whooping it up like a wild Indian ever since. Don't you all have some partying to do? Well, get on with it then! So you ain't really Crazy Joe? You're about half right, ma'am. The name's Otis. Say, maybe you can help me with something here. Pa, it's the deed to Ghost Gulch. I tried to give it to that there fancy banker fella. He didn't seem interested in it. How about you? Where did you find it? Well, them fire water spirits can get a fella into a whole heap of trouble, like picking up things that don't belong to him. You know, I've found something else out there. Maybe that there will make you feel like you can straighten this one out for you. It's that repossession thing, Pa, from the Internal Revenue Service. You might try asking that there banker fella about that. Just between me and you, I think that boy's crazy. Y'all have a good time now. Bye. I'm the one that tore that up. But I thought you was in cahoots with Snively. Oh, not no more. Why, he made all that up about the IRS. Yeah, he even tried to fool me with it, too. But I know this boy doesn't do nothing legal. Why, he was just trying to scare you into having to sell your farm to him. Looks like he's got himself all scared straight now. You got anything to say for yourself, Snively? I do believe in spooks. I do believe in spooks. Bob Bob, come on, I'm going to need some help with this boy. That's a terrible looking thing, hey? Pitiful. My beauty, I finally finished it. This is how I envision your beauty. Mister, I don't know what your idea of beauty is, but if'n you're willing to settle for another roll in the hay, I'm all yours. Oh-- oh-- oh my god. Don't-- don't. Oh god. Pa? What you're doing. Oh god. In the end, everything worked out just fine. Snively went to jail. Missy Sue and Pappy saved the farm. April, May, and June all found true love. Hey, even Joe Bob got laid. As for me, I'm no longer running moonshine. I'm the new Sheriff of Pig Hollow, a happy ending after all, except for old Roscoe, of course. It seems he and Mr. Fuzzy just were a little bit too close. Drop in and see him sometime. You can find him at the Pig Hollow Sanitarium. Well, visiting hours are from 5:00 to 8:00 PM weekdays, 2:00 to 8:00 PM on the weekends. Just remember, don't you be speeding if you're going there 'cause I'll be watching.
