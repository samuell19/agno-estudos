Hanamichi joined the basketball team after Akagi Haruko's suggestion. However... Things didn't end there. During the practice match with one of the best four in the district, Ryonan... Hanamichi's shoot made possible a come back for his team. But Ryonan's ace Sendo's counter attack causing them to lose the match. Pass! It's over. We lose. You made a great job. Slam Dunk #20 Basketball Shoes Good morning! Hey Hanamichi, yesterday was... That hurt! We didn't say anything either! We are only trying to comfort you! Nope. You guys were going to make fun of me. I can tell by looking at your eyes. Can't be helped. Youhei. It looks like he was so upset at their loss over Ryonan yesterday... ...he didn't sleep last night. It looks like he's still pretty pissed off. Then it might be wise if we didn't mention what happened yesterday... Sakuragi. I heard you guys lost yesterday. You probably starting to dislike basketball now, right? Sakuragi, join the judo... Damn it, that monkey... Wait, Sakuragi! The word "defeat" is not in my nor the judo club's dictionary. And if you join the judo club, we'll become invincible. Watch out! Don't you have eyes? Damn those basketball guys... I won't give up. Sakuragi, join the Judo Club. It looks like Sakuragi-kun is in a foul mood today. It looks like they lost the basketball game yesterday. Better leave him alone. I think we would've won if the balls were always passed to Rukawa-kun. I think so too! I think so too! Because he's a genius! That's right! That's right! You big show off! Why you... It's too bad about yesterday's match. What!? That's enough! Morning. Ha... Haruko-san. It's no good... I can't face her... since I lost yesterday. Sakuragi-kun, you don't have to feel bad about it, because you played really well! R... Really? Really! On top of that our opponent was Ryonan. But we lost... just as expected... Well... Sakuragi-kun... Ah, you're Haruko-san's friend. It's Fujii. Fujii-san. Even though you lost... But I... ... was moved... really moved. That's right. That's right. That girl only went to match to support her friend, but she cheered so much during the match! Ah, Haruko-san's friend number 2. Who're you calling number 2? I'm Matsui. That's right! No one would think that it was your first match! My brother also said, "Sakuragi's performance was beyond what I expected." Even though he told me not to tell anyone... But to be able to get my stubborn brother to say something like that... That's really amazing, Sakuragi-kun! Really? Really! And that shot you made turned the tides! You must've been very happy then, right? Well... I just thought about what you told me... Slam... Sakuragi-kun! Put it in. Sakuragi-kun... Just call me the God of Victory! Damn it... if that ball would've won the game... All right, Sakuragi-kun! You're a genius! The God of Victory! Rukawa-kun is nothing compared to you! You are wonderful! Something like that... If that shot would've won the game, you'd become a hero, Sakuragi-kun! A big hero! But to be able to wear out your gym shoes in such short time... Sakuragi-kun, you must've been training really hard. It's just my destiny. Geniuses don't have to train hard. What a simple minded person. Oh yeah, Sakuragi-kun. You should get a pair of basketball shoes! After school. We have to hurry back to practice. There's so many cool looking shoes! This one's nice! This one's nice too! Right, Sakuragi-kun? Yes. It's like a date... I'm so happy! Welcome. If you need a size, let me know, okay? Don't bother us. You're pretty tall! Are you a basketball player? Kind of. What is this bad feeling I'm getting? What school are you from? Shohoku. You're bothering me, old men. Go away. Hey Sakuragi-kun, would you like to try on a pair? Yes! Excuse me, but can he try on a pair? Yes, please do. Why you... What do you want, old man? Such a cute girlfriend you have. Really makes people jealous, you sly fox. G... Girlfriend... Look like it? It looks like it, doesn't it Mr. Owner? Sakuragi-kun, what size are you? 2... 28cm. 28 cm, eh? I'm not young like you, but I'm also 28cm. Really? Hurry up and try it on! I can't tell if it's good or not with your school uniform on... Can he try on some sportswear? What? S... sure... It's pretty good. Yeah... you look more like a basketball player by wearing basketball shoes after all! Really? This one is not too bad either, Sakuragi-kun! This one's good too! This one too. This one too! That one too! It's hard to decide! Try it on! Try it on! Wow, the traction's pretty good! Hey, wait a minute! Please don't mess up my store! Wow, the traction's pretty good! Sakuragi-kun, basketball shoes also have to be able to withstand shocks after jumps. Please don't say anymore Miss... Ah, you shouldn't have said anything. I feel like... I'm jumping higher... ... while I'm wearing these shoes! Hey, stop it! My precious basketball shoes! Precious? Yeah. They're NBA superstar Michael Jordan's hightop basketball shoes! I'm a basketball fanatic, so I have all sorts of memorabilia. Never heard of it, but... ... it looks pretty comfortable... How much is it? How much? This is my... I want them. Since it's used, give me a discount. For 30 yen. (approx. 25 cent) 3... Hi! You're late, Sakuragi! Genius Sakuragi, wearing basketball shoes, has arrived! Let's go! That guy better become somebody... Hi, guys! Finally Hanamichi will put on the show on the court. Letâ€™s cheer him on! If you can hold the ball in a hand, you'll be a great basketball player! Hands up, Kakuta. Damn! Nice try, Sakuragi! It's because I'm a genius. What a big talker. Damn you Rukawa. It's because you're jealous of my talents. Just thinking about how nice and kind Haruko-san was... No one could tell that it was your first match! My brother also said, "Sakuragi's performance was beyond my expectations." To be able to get my stubborn brother to say such thing... That's amazing, Sakuragi-kun! You are amazing! Haruko-san's not just cute, but she's so nice and kind. Why you... you... What do you want, old man? Such a pretty girlfriend you have. Really makes other people jealous of you, you... Girlfriend, eh? Haruko-san's my girlfriend... I guess so... Sakuragi! Haruko-san. What are you doing dazing off in the middle of practice, you idiot. I'm bored! Isn't there anything interesting to do? Lately, I haven't heard about any girls dumping Hanamichi, it's so boring! Haruko-chan likes Rukawa. So he should just give it up already. Come to think of it, since he started high school, his pace of being rejected has slowed... If this keeps up, he won't be able to beat his middle school record! It's because he's hooked on basketball now. It looks like he's found his purpose in life. You should find something too, Ookusu. What are you talking about, Yohei? What about you? Me? Well... I don't know yet... That's what I thought. I'm so bored! What is it? That, that! Those guys. What are they doing? What's with that scared expression? Idiot! This is the best part! Who's that? Shh... Keep your voice down. I'm sorry, but I have someone I like already. I can't go out with you. Sorry. There it is! This is the 10th time since I started high school... You're not really serious. My friends from Shohoku already told me... That in actuality, you already has someone you're really like... a classmate. Well, bro! Don't look so devastated! There's other worst off than you! Compared to Hanamichi, you're still far off! What's 10!? You guys are freshmen, right? Okay, stop! Gather around! Yes! We had a lot of freshmen on the team, but only the five of you are left. Yes. Hmph. What a bunch of wimps. It's okay, there's some like that every year. It's not too bad this year though. The district competitions are about to begin, so we'll have to depend on you guys in the matches. Our district has approximately 200 teams. Including last year's champion Kainan High School. These past 10 years, they have always qualified for the inter high... ... and is known nationally as a strong team. And last year's second place was Shoyo High School, who's close to Kainan in their playing abilities. And then there's Ryonan which has their stars Sendo and Uozumi. Hey. Sakuragi. If you want to beat me, you'll have to train like hell. Sendo. That Sendo... next time, I'll beat you for sure! Listen up! Regardless of whether our opponent is Kainan, Shoyo or Ryonan. The one who can defeat these strong teams... Shohoku! That's right... Shohoku, which has the genius Sakuragi and the Big Gorilla will definitely wi... Who are you calling Big Gorilla? Moron. Sakuragi Hanamichi. Since you bought a new pair basketball shoes, you must be serious about playing basketball. Does it look good on me, Ayako-san? It does, it does. That way you don't have to play barefooted anymore. What the hell are you crazy people doing!? To other people's shoes too! New basketball shoes are more easily torn, so you have to step on the shoes to make it softer. You have to step on new shoes three times. Really? I see... I haven't stepped on it yet. Rukawa... Listen up and don't forget! Our goal is... Being the champion of the country! That's right, Sakuragi. You don't have to say it just as long as you know it. No matter how hard the training will be, you'll have to tolerate and surpass it, got it!? Yeah! Coach. You all played really well yesterday. If you try your best, one day your skills will be incredible. You'll all become really strong. Yes, sir! Okay, let's do our best! And get the championship for sure! Ayako. Huh? He... can he play? Who? Don't act dumb. Who else would I be talking about but... ... him... What's wrong with you? Can't you take a joke? Grabbing me like that. If you don't like it, go ahead and try to do something about it. It looks like he's the boss. Hey, you don't need to worry. We're not going to gang up on you, we're not that low. Just you and me! Come on! Good grief. I just got out of the hospital and this happens... Forget about it, Ookusu. After all, it's our fault. Forget about it. What are you doing, Youhei? Hey, what's your name? It's Mito Youhei. You? All right! Miagi. Miagi Ryouta. Hanamichi and the others have been remotivated to be number one in the nation. At that time, Miagi Ryouta appears. Just what does that mean?
