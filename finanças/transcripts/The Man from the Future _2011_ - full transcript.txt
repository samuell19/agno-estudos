Wait, wait... I need to tell you something. I... I have never ridden on an airplane. It's kind of like this... You shouldn't have done that. Why not? Because I'm going to suffer. One day... you are going to change the world. And I will never leave your side. We have our own time MAN FROM THE FUTURE - We have our own time We have our own time I'm not afraid of the dark But leave the lights on Now What was hidden Is what it got hidden And what was promised Nobody promised lt was not wasted time We are so young So young So young What is reality? Einstein explained it... so that even degenerate brains like yours could understand. Reality is a thread formed by time and space. You haven't paid any bills yet. Good morning, Mr. Arlindo. The force of gravity makes the black holes so heavy that they rip the thread of space, and therefore, time. However, black holes... are the theme ofthe last dissertation ofthe year. It is the last chance to contribute to the holy task... of making you quit Physics and Mathematics... to study more interesting things, like... acupuncture... chromotherapy. Professor? Will acupuncture be on the test? No... but... particle accelerator will. It would help if you would... stop reading that magazine. - Who is she? - Helena. First year of Physics. But stop drooling, because she is taken! This publication will be confiscated under the accusation... of disrupting the class and the progress of Science in Brazil! Zero! Increase the acceleration curve! Zero, we don't have enough power for refrigeration beyond the fifth level. We are overheating it, I'm going to abort! - I forbid you, Panda! - I'm going to abort! I forbid you, Panda! Let it be known on the records: Panda never knew... That you forged my signature! That you did an unauthorized test, or that you burned out two university generators? I just need more power. It is insane to do things without telling me. I fought more than anybody for your project! Because you know you are going to get rich with it. This has nothing to do with money, Jo?o. Howmany scientists in the world... are using a particle accelerator in a project? One... you! Do you knowhowmany rules I have broken... and howmany lies I have told to finance your garage laboratory? Sandra, you may have given up on Science... because you won money on the stock market. You got rich. But you used to be a smart girl. I want you to tell me what the damn problem is... because as far as I know, I'm creating a newenergy source here! I know. And they knowit, too. They. I created a technology fund to finance your converter, but they got tired of your madness! Say it, you witch! They want to put Steve Webs in your place. Steve Webs can't turn on a toaster! They filed a lawsuit claiming that you have gone mad. I'm going to the press and say that Americans are trying to steal... Brazilian scientific patrimony. That will only make our situation worse! Enough! You are a genius. You have invented something extraordinary. I believe that more than even you do. That is why I need you to behave... like a normal human being in the next 48 hours, so that I can try to put things in order. That is all! Or what? Or I think your future ends here. - They invited me to stay. - Traitor! But I didn't accepted it. Stupid! You have a wife and kids to support. The project is yours. What have I done? I did the engineering! So... let's take what is ours! You need authorization from the university, the mayor, the governor, or even from the president, to get to 100% load! Those are the people who want to fire us! - Do you knowwhat I think? - No, but I know... - you are going to tell me. - It's because ofher. It's still because of her! I don't knowwhat you are talking about. If this works, you won't be able to go back to your little life! - But I happen to like my little life! - It's too bad. Because your little life is about to end! You are going to write History! Even if I agree to this madness, we don't have enough power. Yes, we do. This is Sushi. Sushi! This kid is not authorized to be here! He doesn't have authorization to be awake at this hour! Zero, look at me. What is he doing here? Access to the city's power supply, complete. You havejust passed the class, son. You are sick! You are sick in the head! Since when, Doctor Freud? November 22nd, 1991. November 22nd, 1991. Zero! Zero! Zero! Why are they doing this to me? - Because I told them to. - But you love me! November 22nd, 1991. Access to the city's power supply... complete. We can go tojail, Zero, tojail! I will broadcast this on the web. I want them to arrest me tomorrow. You are going to ruin our carriers. And for what? Lt's better if you call her. - Here, take my phone and call her. - She doesn't exist! She never... existed! I need your help. OK! Millions of years ago, the primitive man rubbed two little rocks together and lit up a cave. Tonight, humanity will kiss their energy bill goodbye. Aligned curves. Zero, get out of there now! Get out ofthere now, Zero! Soon the world will be powered by the energy form... we are about to create here tonight! - Cut the power. - He locked the system from the inside. And to prove our invention is not only revolutionary, but safe, I will be positioned at the center of the event. Zero, no! Initiating sequence. Tonight we will be gods. Someday you will change the world. Tonight I'm going to change the world. My machine was stolen! God! They drugged me. DANGER Sandra, you executive cow. You cancelled the telephone! Bitch. Sir? Sir, wake up! That's 25 thousand. The meter says 25 thousand. - 25? - 25. Thousand? Look... I had a very rough day. I'm not a tourist! I will give you 50. It's all I have. Hey! But this money is not real. Of course it is real! Lt says right here, underthejaguar: "Real"! "Re-al"! The key... Sir, this is a family building. I know, mister Arlindo. I've been living here since 1998. Great! Then come back in seven years. MisterArlindo, you are... You haven't paid any bills yet. Young... Look, I am going to call the police! I am going to call the police. Collor's year. The majorfacts of the govermentfirstyear... of the president that hunts maharajahs. Z?lia, the Iron Minister. Jet ski, the anti drug combat. Don't misst it, 91 retrospective. - What day is today? - Today is Tuesday, the 22nd. - Of when? - Of, of, November, sir. Forthe love of God, what year is this? We are in 1991, sir. Anno Domini. Which means... thank you. November 22nd... 1991. Einstein postulated that the Universe... is a thread formed by time and space. However, gravity makes the black holes so heavy that they rip the thread of space, and therefore, time. Hi. Mathematicians, Physicists and astrophysicists wrestle with this equation for years... Hi. - My name is Helena. - I know. Your name is Jo?o, right? I read your paper about quantum paradoxes. - It... It wasn't ready yet. - No, of course not. You are trying to write a general equation for the universe. Lfit was ready yet, you would change the world. Helena? - Because I... - Let's go? Can we go? Get out, please! My phone number. I have heard that you tutor Quantum Physics. If you have some spare time, call me, OK? Bye. The superstring theory guarantees the quantum existence of multiple universes, where every bifurcation caused by time travel would result in the creation of a new reality... I don't have money. It's on the house. You look like you need it. Come on, drink, drink... Woman? - Woman. - Recently? Lt happened a long time ago. But it will happen again in 1 hour and 42 minutes. - Is it that precise? - That precise. There is nothing you can do about it? There is. But if I do it, maybe I'll die. Goal! - Can I smoke in here? - Of course. This is a bar, isn't it? Lfl change what is going to happen... I will be different than what I am. So maybe I will cease to exist. Understand? A man can't live in fear. Love, hate are... concrete. They need to take part in the general equation ofthe universe. Jo?o, that's beautiful! You are trying to prove that love exists. I knowthat it exists. Helena... I think this... should be our last class. You are doing very well on every test. I'm proud of you. Can we go? And Ricardo... is coming to pick you up, and I don't like the way he looks at me. I'm... afraid ofhim. You are right, but we can't live in fear. You are absolutely right. You are absolutely right. I bet you one million that Flamengo will turn the game around! Show me the money! Spot me the money and I'll share it with you. I can't lose, I have seen this game before! No, not this game. It's being transmitted live. Ga?cho will tie the game. Look at the TV. Ga?cho appears, sees the Flamento draw... Come on, place the bet! One million! Flamengo five to three! Why are you doing this to me? You bastard! Ant?nio Carlos, who is that cow? Honey, calm down! I can explain everything. - Bastard. - What time is it? I don't know. I'm having an argument with my boyfriend! Sandra, the band is wrapping up. Go back to the stage! Jo?o? Jo?o! What happened? What did you do with your hair? You look awful! I was never here. You never sawme. You never sawme! Lt was the nun. She was taking care oftriplets at the orphanage. Then, she was inserting a suppository in them, right? Thank you forthe costume... but I can't go to this party with you. Why are you running from me? Because it hurts. What hurts, Jo?o? Seeing you. Look at me. I can't take it anymore. I love you! Explain it. Why? You loving me is not logical. Helena... I like things logical. I'm going to kiss you. All right? You are... the queen of the school. I'm a poor man with a stammer and a scholarship. Handsome... I need you in my life. I wouldn't last a second in your life! I know why. I'm your bestfriend. So you knowhowlonely... I am and howmuch I need you! What about Ricardo? Lt's over. I'm yours. Look at me. Look at you... I have looked at myself, Jo?o. I sawmyself... ridiculous, futile... easily impressed. You are beautiful! Beauty is a prison. And, because ofbeauty, I have seen and done things that even God doesn't know. And I thought it was important. You... rode in the Stones' airplane. You knowwhat? Nobody talks about Quantum Physics in the Stones' airplane. Not even the Stones ride in their airplane. Wait. I have never ridden on an airplane. It's kind oflike this. You shouldn't have done that. - Why not? - Because I'm going to suffer. I will never leave your side. Bitch! One day, you are going to change the world. I need to go. What? The song is over. Where are you going? I'm going to sing. Put this on, and I'll wait foryou downstairs. You're going to sing? Yes. To you. I love you. Calm down. I want you to be absolutely calm and trust me! Why? Why should I trust you? I don't have time for a subtle approach. You are smart and your are going to understand. Who are you? Look at me. And tell me who I am. Daddy? You have invented something extraordinary! I didn't invent anything. In the future. I did? Atime machine? Yes. Actually, you wanted to invent... a new energy source, but... it backfired! This is all really incredible, but... you know, I have to meet Helena. Why don't you come back anothertime? Because I don't know howto get back! What do you want from me? To fix... your existence. The synchronized swim girls! And nowlet's go to the second auctioned item! Lt's a beautiful used Playboy collection! From 82 to the latest edition! Remember that we are raising funds... forthe reform of the administration's office. Who is going to bid first? - Is it good have 40 years? - No! - 100 thousand! - 100 thousand forthe Lost Soul! - But will I have a happy life? - No! You don't have a wife, you don't have kids, you only have sex with prostitutes... and spend your entire life teaching to idiots... and being scientifically exploited by a soir?e host! 100 thousand and 300 for the Zombie! Come on, people! - What about Helena? - Helena is a whore! But we will take care ofthat too. 100 thousand and 600! 100 thousand and 600 for the toilet paper. Going once! I don't like you! Maybe I'm stuck here forever! Maybe I'll be sucked into the future! Or maybe I'll just explode! In all ofthose scenarios we have to take this chance... and prevent your life from being miserable! Going twice! How? I knowwhen the next war is going to start, when the Dollar will rise and when the stock market will crash. And what do I do with that? I thought you were smarter! You are going to make millions and enjoy your life! Sold to the toilet paper! Turn it up, DJ! Damn, the weirdest thingjust happened! I sawa guy that looked just like you, except his face was a little deformed, he was older... and was dressed like him! Is that you, Jorj?o? Calm down! I want you to be absolutely calm... and trust me. You are going to have to tell somebody, oryou are going to go crazy. You should tell a friend. And that will be the only friend you will have your entire life. - What are you doing? - Let's get down to it! No! No! What the hell is this, man? What the hell is this? Quiet, people! Quiet! Quiet! I have a very important message from the infirmary. They are running out of glucose! Let's go easy on the vodka! Before we continue... with our next musical guest... the Prisoners ofthe Ball! Come on, people! Turn it up, DJ! Who is the most beautiful girl ofthe party? Your mother! Is she here? I have something very important to tell you. Helena... listen to me! Ricardo, I slapped you an hour ago. I'm not going to listen to you! I met the owner of a modeling agency... a Spaniard, friend of my father's. Lfhe likes you, we will get a lot of money! - We? - I told him I was your manager! Pathetic! He believed you? And the most important thing of all! Never, under any circumstance, travel to New York... on September 11th 2001. Why? Because some crazy guy will crash two airplanes into the Twin Towers. They will fall. Which will lead to a second war against Iraq! The oil prices will rise, then fall, then rise again. - Are you writing this down? - Every word. I'm not sure I want to know what is going to happen. Believe me. You do. I'm going to make you two rich! Let's listen to the man. I mean, listen to yourself, right? I don't knowifl want to change the future. I don't want to knowanything. Helena will humiliate you tonight. Helena? What do you mean, she is going to humiliate you? You are... Dating. Humiliate me? How? You will be hung by a string. You will be covered in feathers and honey. Where is Helena? And you will fly over this crowd, and they will laugh! While they chant what is going to be your name forthe rest of your life. Ricardo is right. I can't date a nobody... like you. Oh, my God. That must be horrible. Believe me. There is nothing worse. She said she loved me. I told you it was suicide to tutor a monument like that. - Where are you going? - To finish... your education. Write this down. Women are sincere in every generation. I found the love of my life! Who are you trying to fool? Give it up for the Prisoners of the Ball! Get out! Now... the proofthat there is a God. The queen of all parties: Helena! The Physics sophomore! Later, there is going to be a party at the administration's office. I'm going to sing this song to the most amazing man... I have ever met in my life! Every day when I wake up I lose the time that has passed But I have a lot of time We have all the time in the world Every day before I go to sleep I remember and forget about that day Always moving forward We don't have time to lose Our sacred sweat Is more beautiful than this bitter blood And so serious And wild This is the siren's song. This is when your life's disaster begins! Jo?o, is she singing and looking at you? Yes! Bring me that prince! - I don't want to change anything else. - This is... when time splits. Look at the sun on this dark morning You are asking me to give her up? No! The storm comes I'm telling you a way to be with her. Has the same color as your eyes Hazel So hold me tight And tell me once again that we are Far away from everything We have our own time That girl is the reason foryourfailure! She can be yours now, because you are in control now. Remember everything I told you. It's like an equation, and you knowall the variables. That's right, champ! Just one more thing... The stutter. What... What stutter? Your speech problem. People who stutter don't breathe correctly. - Who told you that? - Helena. She cured you at the stage 15 minutes ago, in a reality that no longer exists. And we don't want to stutter forthe rest of our lives, right? Here's what I want you to do... Disappearing isn't a good way to start a relationship. Helena, listen! What you sang to me was the most beautiful thing... I'll ever hear in my entire life. I'm going to love you forever! You're not... The thing is: Do you love me? I have never felt for anybody the way I feel for you! Then why didn't you tell me you are going to Paris? I'm not going... Ricardo spoke to you. But I knowhe offered you a life ofluxury, parties and money. - How can you knowthat? - How can I knowthat? How... can I knowthat? How can I knowthat? Lt doesn't matter! I knowthat we will be dancing, a piece of your hair will cover your face, he will get here, he will be nice and he will be dressed as an angel. Atoast to the couple ofthe night! He'll bring two glasses of spiked champagne. Why would he do that? To convince you to do what you have always wanted it. - And what would that be? - To humiliate me, to abandon me... to throwme to the wolves and live your life ofluxury, sex and drugs... in the international jet set. You have gone mad! Lt's possible. But we have to check! Enough, enough, bambino. Let's go, please... Hey, man! That's the girl I told about. Now dance. Dance normally. Normally, normally. She is very pretty! But she looks completely in love with that moron. Nonsense! The piece of your hair! Wow, you look beautiful! I'm not going to waste time and money with a girl who's in love. Shejust needs a little push. Alittle push, huh? But be careful. This is very strong. Do it. That's too much. I told youjust one drop. Atoast to the couple ofthe night! So that's your prince charming? That's your guardian angel? - Jo?o, Ricardo, Ricardo, Jo?o. - Champagne? Not this time, no. Helena really likes champagne. - She is also going to like GHB. - GHB? Lt's a drug that doesn't exist in Brazil yet, but it does in Spain. You put it in it. - That's ridiculous! - Drink it! Lfit'sjust champagne, I'll be ajealous paranoid. She's going to think that I'm ajerk and she'll sign the contract... - with the Spaniard. Right, Helena? - Right. Helena, did you tell anything to this imbecile? He is trying to manipulate you, to throwyou against me. And he is succeeding! Prove that I'm crazy... and get this over with! I thought you liked champagne. Now... The other one! The other one! Atta, boy! Let me showyou something. Look. Do you see that guy overthere? That's the Spaniard! He's the one that can give you a life ofluxury, parties and money. Jo?o! But that means you are never going to see me again! What are you talking about? I would never leave you! You did! You left me. And I need to tell you... I... I understand, because I was always a nobody... and you were always... All of this! - But I never left. - But I changed! - But I don't want you to change! - I changed! Do you want luxury? Do you want parties? Do you want money? Do you want wealth? I can give you that, Helena! Do you knowwhy? Because I'm going to be rich! I'm going to be very rich! And you will have anything you want! Jo?o, I would love you even if you didn't have a penny. Wow! You two are beautiful! Life is beautiful! Life is beautiful! Touch?! Touch?! I'm feeling very unstable. You are emotional, aren't you? No. My molecules are unstable... Does that hurt? Stay close to Jo?o. He always liked you very much. Are you dying? Probably! I love this woman! I love you! - I love you! - Me too! I promise you... we will be togetherforever! But it will be worth it! Every day when I wake up I lose the time that has passed But I have a lot of time We have all the time in the world Every day before... Helena are you... Another person! Wow! What's the matter, baby? You look like youjust sawan alien! What are you doing here? Lf you haven't fired me, I'm here to pay foryour escort! Ric, darling! Howare you? - Thanks, honey! - Thank you! Don't be sad. Deise will be back... next week, OK? All right. Put this on fast. We are late. Late? Wait! I... - Where... are we going, again? - Very funny! No! Seriously! Where are we going? I... I need to talk... to Ot?vio. Even funnier! The hearing will start in 30 minutes. Hearing? Of course. Which hearing is it, again? Lt's... I don't know what the hell you're on, but control yourself in front ofthejudge. Judge? I'm... another man! Do you understand? I'm another person... Panda... The court has decided that Mr. Jo?o Henrique Nogueira is the sole owner ofthe Man of the Future Investment companies. I am... the mummy. And mister Ot?vio Miranda... is forbidden to came within a 300 feet radio from his former partner. Whatever this is, we can fix it! You coward! You bribed thisjudge! - No! - I'm going to kill you! - I'm going to kill you! - Panda! Lt's me! - I'm going to kill you! - Future Jo?o! You... Let's get out ofhere to avoid reporters. He assaulted me, he... he... hit me. He said I bribed thejudge! Someone in the court must have leaked that. But how can I be broke? What about your problems with the IRS? You got married fourtimes, you publicly cheated all your wives, you got sued by three ofthem. If that's not enough to bankrupt someone, add your gambling problem, race tracks... - Race tracks? - International travels... expansive hookers, high risk investments, megalomaniac architects, expensive wines. Jo?o, you bought a submarine! Wait! Wait! You said I got married fourtimes... - and that three ofthem sued me. - That's right! - Who didn't sue me? - Who? The annoying one. Helena? Jo?o Henrique, you're scarring me! I married Helena? Helena... I'm not obligated to see visitors! Wait! Wait! Please, wait! I need to talk to you. - I want to go back to my cell! - Listen, just one minute! One minute. I'll get you out ofhere. I'll get you out ofhere. One minute. You have one minute! One minute... What happened to us? What kind of question is that? How did you ended up here? You know damn well howl got here! Asuitcase with four and a half pounds of cocaine! Cocaine! My God! Why didn't you tell me? Because you were the one who put the damn drug in my suitcase! And then you called the airport police! Why did I do that? To punish me for something I didn't do! Because ofjealousy! To stick me in a place with no men around! I want you to be absolutely calm. And trust me. I am... another person. You are nothing! You're right. You're right. That's what I am. That's what I've always been... A zero. But I will get you out ofhere, Helena. I will get you out of here and we will be together forever. I'll tell you... There's nothing in this life that could make me come back to you. Nothing. Helena... You shouldn't have done that to me! Hownice to see you! I needed to find someone smart. I wasn't smart when I put my project... in the hands of an idiot like you! Forget that! Whatever it is, we can fix it. I didn't sell a particle converter specs... just so it would be locked up in a safe! You developed a particle converter? Cynic! I created a new energy source! I'm going to tell the press that you're selling Brazilian technology... to Americans! I came here to warn you... I will put my research on the Internet. I want it built. From behind bars, if necessary. Sandra... Sandra! Particle converter... Look, believe me. You are pointing this gun at the wrong man. I knowexactly who I'm pointing this gun at! What did you do to Jo?o? I need to kill him too. He disappeared in a temporal paradox. I was molecularly reorganized in this reality's body, but with the conscience ofthe other one. - Speak in my language! - I'm in his body. I'm putting a stop to this madness right now! No, wait! I curse the day you walked into my life! Calm down, calm down... Look, you have a wife, you have kids. You married the woman who was supposed to be my wife! I never had kids! I married Carmem? Whatever you did in the past, it can't be worse than the person you became. Who did I become? The biggestjerk the world has ever seen! What about you? I used to say: "Let's help humanity, let's save Michael Jackson, let's prevent the American oil spill.". But you didn't care about any ofit. You would say: "Money, money!" And I agreed. We are two of nature's anomalies who deserve to die. No! Please! I already decided it. I'll kill you first. Then I'm going to kill myself. Wait. Please! Please! Wait! Listen to me, please! Please! Please. I have a plan. I have heard this before. We have money to build a newaccelerator, - go back and fix things. - How? By convincing myselfthat is wrong to change the past. For you. You are sick. You knowthat? Please. Let me at least take you home. - I don't have a home. - You do now! You bought this house for me? No. No, actually I... I gave it. Just like the farm in Australia, the access to my bank account, my shares in the stock market, the cocoa fields, the apartment at the Dakota Building in New York, two jets, four helicopters, twelve cars in the garage, soy fields in Mato Grosso. The Manets, the Monets, the Matisse, Picasso, Gauguin, Van Gogh. Acollection of free art. I don't knowif you like it. Three radio stations, TVstations, an island in the Pacific. Anyway, everything. Except the submarine that I had to sell and the Man ofthe Future Investments that I'm going to leave to Panda. The IRS is afteryou, isn't it? No. It is, but... It's not because ofthat. Then, why? I'm still trying to fix things and... lfit doesn't work, you will be set for life. I won't like you again because ofthis. I know. That's why I'm going to do what I'm going to do. Howabout it? You knowthat's an astronaut costume and it doesn't work. - You knowthat, don't you? - I'm going to a costume party. God! Tell me you are not going insane. The machine we created left a micro black hole, it perforated the structure of time... and let a link to the past. I know. The first time I got into the machine... I was thinking about Helena, on the day of the costume party. And I ended up exactly there! On the same time and the same date. And I'm going to do that again. Is that simple? Apparently feelings reorganize matter... as it leaves a black hole. - You must really love this woman! - Desperately! Helena... November 22nd, 1991. The day ofthe party. Helena... November 22nd, 1991. The day ofthe party. Helena... November 22nd, 1991. The day ofthe party. Helena... November 22nd, 1991. The day ofthe party. Helena... November 22nd, 1991. Wow, Inoc?ncia, you are awesome! My God! I have goose bumps! Excuse me. What day is today? - 20... - 22... November 22... November. - Great! Of what year? - 1991. - Great! Please, I need... - Get out! - Unlock it! - Wait! I need a ride! - Go away! Go away! - I need a ride! I love you! Too late! Calm down. I want you to be absolutely calm... and trust me. Why? Why should I trust you? I don't have time for a subtle approach. You are smart and you are going to understand. Who are you? And who is he? Calm down. I want you to be absolutely calm... - and trust me. - What are you? I'm the effect that you are causing right now! - What effect? - Catastrophe. That bad? He is going to be arrested by the IRS, Ot?vio will kill himself... and Helena is going tojail. OK. You tell everything I did wrong and we will start over. - We don't have to do anything. - What do you mean? You don't change what already happened. You cheap moralist! He has the right to have a chance! He has to live for himself. You are going to tell me what I have done wrong! Give it up for the Prisoners ofthe Ball! Get out, Carlinhos, now! Now... the proofthat there is a God. The queen of all parties: Helena! The Physics sophomore! I'm going to sing this song... to the most amazing man I have ever met in my life! "I had a hallucination and I passed out. I must go to the party! Helena is waiting for me! Signed myself." Our sacred sweat Is more beautiful than... Dude, the weirdest thing just happened! This is the craziest night of my life! And so serious And wild Wild Wild Bring me that prince! What? Is she singing to you? She can't be singing to you! You are a nobody, right? No, am not! I am a prince! Look at the sun on this dark morning The storm comes has the same color as your eyes Hazel His name is Jo?o! Jo?o! Jo?o! Jo?o! Breathe, Jo?o! You just have to exhale and sing. So hold me tight And say it one more time that we are together Away from everything We have our own time We have our own time We have our own time I'm not afraid of the dark But leave the lights on Now What was hidden is what it got hidden And what was promised Nobody promised lt was not wasted time We are so young So young So young And you wanted to take this away from him! No! I wanted to avoid everything that comes next! One more! One more! One more! One more! One more! One more! The lovebirds are invited to the party at the administration's office, where there will be champagne and a few otherthings. - We can't! - The Spaniard will be there, Helena. Screwit! One more! One more! One more! I think that's my gun. You must be my best friend from the future. Where I come from, you're not exactly my friend. How did you get here? I thought it was relatively easy o press a bottom and, puff! Jump to wherever you want to go. I'm going to give my Ot?vio some tips. The problem is that this idiot doesn't want to change anything else! Oh, you don't want to? You don't want to? But I do! - Wait! Wait! - Will you take me away from here? Why did you treat him like that? He wasjust trying to be nice to us. I want to go some place alone with you! Look at me. They are having a big party. Let's dance! You are acting strange! Who is this Spaniard? Someone I don't want to meet, OK? Let's get out of here and go someplace else. Just you and I. Listen to me! I have never been invited to a party like that. I have never had a girlfriend. I feel great! I have never been so happy! - Jo?o... - I feel alive! And you are not stammering! I'm not? Let's be togetherforever! Let's go! Here! We have some rope. Come! You bastard, nowyou are going to be stuck here. I'm going to find myself, OK? You have time to do that later. It's about to happen. We need to let time take its course. - Coward! - You're the coward. You have always been. Arrogant, pretentious, unhappy, coward! This guy is annoying. You better gag him. You suffered. He will suffer. My God! What is the matter with you? Everybody suffers in life! Only an unhappy man like you... can think your suffering is something special! Sorry. It was too annoying. That's the girl I told about. Sorry, pirate! Are you hurt? Nice party... Come here! Let's dance! That's too much. I told you just one drop. What a crazy party, Helena! Atoast to the couple ofthe night! Come with me. No! Damn it! They can't drink from those glasses. Go, go! Let's go! Man, I wanted to tell you... that you are dealing with this very maturely. Champagne to the prince charming and the super lady. We are going to drink this and leave, because we have otherthings to do. Atoast to an unforgettable night! - Cheers! - Cheers! Excuse me, excuse me. Your costume hasjust been selected by panel... as the best one ofthe party. He is coming with us on the stage! - Give me back my boyfriend! - No, no, no! He has to come on stage right now to receive this award. Helena, our love has won an award! Jo?o, let's get out ofhere! Helena, you can't stop living your life because of this idiot! Don't talk to my girlfriend like that. Let go of me! You knowwhat she doesn't understand? Is that when she gets tired of you tomorrow... and dump you, it will be too late. She will have lost an international carrier... because of a nobody like you! I've always wanted to do that! You are coming with us! - What are you doing? - She has to know! Last time she didn't know and it went wrong. We have to include her this time. Include where? Do what? Hey! Who is there? Look, somebody played a prank on me. Will you shut up? Can'tyou see I'm crying? Weren't you dressed as... Jo?o? - Helena, Helena! - Jo?o? Helena, these mummies are extremely fun! Please, untie me! Lt'sjust that my boyfriend broke up with me. And I have to go back to the stage to announce the chickens. It's OK that Antonio Carlos dumped you. Marco Aur?lio will be the love of your life! - Marco Aur?lio? - Yes... Marco Aur?lio! You two are going to be together next Saturday at the Tit?s concert! I don't believe in psychics, OK? And you must be tied down for a reason. So I'm calling the police so you can tell your story. We've met at kinder garden, in misses Olga's class. I pulled your skirt and you made me eat dirt... and I got sick for a week. When we got a little older, we started playing spin the bottle, but you never wanted to kiss me. Calm down! I want you to be absolutely calm. And trust me. I came from the future. And I can prove it. How? Here! In my pocket. You can trust me. Take it! - What's in there? - Here, take it! What is it? What is this? Lt's a telephone, a computer, a personal organizer, a camera... 20 years from nowalmost everybody will have one ofthese. It records too? Press the middle button. It's recording. How cute! Antonio Carlos, I want you to rot in hell! Why are you telling me all ofthis? Because I want you to let me go. And because I think lfigured all out. Followme. This is where we are going. Helena! The mummies' house! - Jo?o! - It's a colored tunnel! Don't hurt her, fat boy! Mummy friends, I think I want to go back now. - Who are you? - Your chance to change your life! To know everything that is going to happen! Careful! Jo?o! You are going to pay for this, you bastard! Have I gone insane? No, Helena. So, forthe love of God, explain what is happening here! I did what you said I would. I changed the world. Helena... You idiot! I need you to be absolutely calm and trust me. I came from your future! I'm Jo?o 20 years from now. What about them? He is me before I understood howwrong all of this is, and the other one is a loser from an alternative future of mine. - And I'm not crazy? - No. But you are at a quantum paradox. And how do we stop a quantum paradox? You knowthis. We studied this together, remember? By cancelling the matrix ofthe multiplication of variables. We have to conduct reality... back to the time flux that already happened. And howdo you plan on doing that? Tonight you have to turn your back on him, forget everything you sawhere. I want you to go with Ricardo and the Spaniard. And tomorrowyou are going to be an international model in Paris. No! But he is the love of my life. If you really love him, you have to do this. - Otherwise it's going to be the end. - No! Lt's the beginning of our lives together. It's the end! Believe me, it's the end. I have invented the end oftimes machine. I invented it, jerky! Humanity will go back to the past eternally to make the future better. Corporations, governments, evil geniuses... They will go back to increase the profit margin, to win an election, to dominate the world. There will never be a future again. So that's it? In order to save the world I have to stay away from the man I love? You have to promise me you are not going to look for him until 2011. If you truly love him, maybe we will still meet in this lifetime. I will tell you... I love you today as much as I loved you tonight. - And I can't see you? - I have always been like this. I get it. I have always come back and made you betray me, so we would be apart from each other. The machine created a moment where the future and the pass blend. They need each other in orderto happen. No... No! I can't! Helena, look around. There's three of me in this place! This is terribly wrong. This is biggerthan everything. It's biggerthan me and it's bigger than you. You can't do that to me. You need to do that to me. Both of us... together... for love. Hey! You two! What's going on there? You are going to be a wonderful man. And you... You are the kind of man that is worth waiting for. What is this? That's his newname. Zero? What do you want me to do with this? I want you to hang it on his neck in front of everybody. Tell Ricardo to call the zombies that he hired for security. Tell him he was right, that I'm an idiot and that you want Jo?o to be the night's chicken. Go, Helena! How can you be so cruel to yourself? Because this happened! And it needs to happen again. - What about you? - I don't know. - Will I see you again? - It's not very likely mathematically. Then, Jo?o, you are going to have to prove... that love is part ofthe general equation ofthe universe. Get out ofhere! Go! Hey, astronaut, you need to stop kissing my girlfriend. Helena is gone. Nowyou need to go too. I'm crazy, really crazy! Listen... It's going to be very hard. Look, astronaut, I'm Chinese. But you will get through this. OK? Astronaut, you are behaving like an old aunt. You are like my father. Because he was right. Life is about dealing with problems. There is no life without problems. - You are cool! - You too! Lt was nice meeting you. It changed my life! Who are you? A dream that you will forget. Antonio Carlos, you can be with your bitch! Marco Aur?lio, I'll see you Saturday at the Tit?s concert. What's up? Hello, friends! Ready to fly? Get him! - Give it up for Cl?ber! - Wonderful! Wonderful! - Hey, let go of me! - Get this woman out ofhere. Let me go! And now, here is tonight's little bird! Put your hands together for him! Smearthis idiot with honey! I told you that you would end up getting hurt! Helena! Helena! I'm here! Helena... Why are they doing this to me? Because I told them to. But you love me! Ricardo was right. I could never love a zero like you. Do you want to fly, chicken? Jo?o! Get out! Get out! Get out ofthe way! Jo?o! Let go of me! Lt's too late to try to help. Sandra, help me! Let him go! Can't you see he is not alright? - He has never been better. - Take it away! Lt's happening! - Here is... - Jo?o! The return of Helena's newlast boyfriend! Helena! And your boyfriend? I set up a date 20 years from now. The future of Ot?vio, the investor, is no longer possible. Fly, little birdie! Helena! He is a zero! I said zero! What the hell are you doing, Ricardo? Zero! Zero! Zero! Zero! Lt happened what... it was supposed to happen. Zero. Help me, man! Are you dressed as an astronaut? I went to a costume party, Panda. You didn't go anywhere! An energy pulse of unknown source went through you. That's right. You were right! We created fire! We are gods! We are rich! What is this? Waming! All files will be deleted. What are you doing? I'm making sure no one will ever turn this machine on. You can't do that! You can't do that! You can't do that! Sushi, fix this! I'm trying! I'm trying! Panda, listen to me. - It's the work of a lifetime, Zero. - I travelled through time. My God... Twice. So you are... completely crazy! Lt records too? Press the middle button. It's recording. How cute! Antonio Carlos, I wantyou to rot in hell! Why are you telling me all of this? Because I think I figured all out. Waming! All files have been deleted. Do you have the car keys? I always thought you'd come back today. Why didn't you get in? Stop being stupid and get in. No, wait! - What's the damn problem? - Time is the problem, Ricardo! Jo?o! Zero. Excuse me, excuse me, sir. - You can call me Zero. - Hi, Zero. Howwas your life? Fun, a little crazy, lonely. What about yours? Lt is going to be what I make of it now. I'll never leave your side. So kiss me because I'm going to be arrested. Sir, please, come with us! - We will miss this flight. - Sir! - I love you! - I love you too! Ricardo! You are fired. ONE YEAR LATER So, I hereby declare that mister Jo?o Henrique Nogueira is found not guilty of destroying scientific research. You did what you had to do. Yes. You hid the humanity's biggest invention. Sooner or later someone will invent that thing again. Yes, but we hope... they come to the same conclusion as we did. And you are a free man. Free, unemployed, expelled from the scientific community, laughing stock on the Internet. For someone who was going to change the future, you have a guaranteed place in heaven. Maybe not. Surprise! I think I figured it out! - Figured what out? - What you have always known. You set up a technology fund to help me! That doesn't make sense. Unless you knew... that one day I would go to the past and find you. You are a genius! I believe that more than yourself! That doesn't make any sense! I don't have money. But you will have! You made money at the stock market. You got rich! You will make millions with Google shares! Google? Is that a chewing gum? Lt's a search engine. What am I going to do with Google shares? You will sell them, one day before the mortgage recession. You will make a lot of money, you will buy this university and you will help Jo?o when he needs you the most. Howmany scientists in the world... are using a particle accelerator in a project? One... you! Untie me. Please. Tell me only ifl come back. You came back, didn't you? Wait, wait! Are you saying that I'm rich? Panda, you are filthy rich! Oh! Fabulous! You cheated it! I deserved it! So hold me tight And tell me once again That we are Far away from everything We have our own time We have our own time We have our own time I'm not afraid of the dark But leave the lights on Now What was hidden Is what it got hidden And what was promised Nobody promised lt was not wasted time We are so young So young So young
