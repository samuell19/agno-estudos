Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one… Happy New Year! I love you, baby! Congratulations, baby! Huh? - Going to varsity. - Yes, that's me. - When did you get the text? - They've just sent it. -Let's get out of here. It might get worse than it already is. Guys, he's scared! Happy! Mmm-mm! Mmm-mm! Huh-uh! Please stop! -Damn! Wow! Varsity. Aunt, I passed! I got three distinctions! Can you believe it? Wow! Finally, I can get rid of that school uniform. Oh! By the way, you need to send a deposit along with my matric results. My girl. Isn't there a cheaper school Not this again, Aunty. I told you there is no better school that offers a Degree in Acting. Acting again? But you said if I pass you going to let me go. Yes, because I thought you'd realise that there's no money in acting. Well, that's what I've chosen. Then that means we have to move to plan B. But you've never told me about plan B though. That's because I didn't think we'd needed it… but the way you are carrying on we will definitely need plan B. You remember that stokvel, Hope of Glory that fell apart? Yes. Well I took all your varsity savings and invested it there. I'm leaving. Aunt, you took my tuition money and invested it in Hope of Glory! Who does that! Kedibone! I was hoping for a great return on my investment so I could give this house a facelift and also pay for your tuition. Okay, now how will I go to university if there's no money? Are you saying I should stay at home the whole year? Am I homebound doing nothing? I've been working at Checkers for 16 years. I spoke with my manager and he said I should bring your CV and you can start working. Me? Work at Checkers? If you start now, you'll have a huge pension fund by the time you retire. That's not going to happen. I'm not going to work at Checkers! Kedibone! Stop acting like a spoilt child. You know the situation. There is no money. It's gone! My goodness! Huh-uh! Really! Argh! Uh! You know sometimes I wish my mom was here. Coz I wouldn't be going through all of this. Like… I just want to study, baby. I don't want to be a statistic, I want to leave the township and just further my studies. -Baby. Listen… You will go to varsity. Okay? -Hey? You seem to forget that I can make anything happen. Look… I never want to see you cry, baby. Understand? Just trust me and all will be fine. I need this student loan, please! - My sister. - It's a bit too late, hey. I can't help you. I know, but I really need your help… - I can't afford to take a gap year. - It's already too late. I'd kill to have a car like this, bra. Eish! - Cool! - Cool! There's no jitter here, do you hear. Because it's a German machine. Your dad left you a good inheritance, hey! Convertible! Coupe. Woah! I just wannt study, baby. You will go to varsity. Okay? I am totally going to beat you. There! Take that! Hey, Mrembula. What's up, buddy? Hah! Take that! Mrembula… What's up, brother? I sold my car. I had to, man. Kedibone… varsity… Mrembula, are you telling me that you sold your car? Because of a girl? Huh? Mrembula sold the car that his father gave him? The whole BMW 325i is gone. How much did you sell it for? - Twenty five. - What! Twenty five thousand? Have you lost your mind? Huh! You're telling me you sold your whole inheritance for Kedibone… for R25,000? You know what that car is? That's a classic. You and Mrembula are couple goals. You're my role model. Themba… sell his car? - He would never do that for me. - Bottom line, we're going to varsity. Yes! First years. First years. How much do you still need? Ten thousand… Okay, listen… Mrembula said he'd give me R25,000. So, I will give you R5,0000 and we will both be short. Kedi… - Are you being for real? - Yes. Kedi! Oh…! Kedi! This is the car I was telling you about. We call it Rosary. Rosary? Yeah, you know that thing… Mother Theresa? Say a short prayer and it'll get you to work. You see? Here's the key. If you fix it… you can drive it. Are we good? Yeah. Thank you. Sure! Mrembula bro… Look at this! Hey! What's all this? I'm tired of being friends with guys who can't think with their heads. Go to hell! Can you fix this car or not? Yeah, the starter just needs a bit of attention. Well then stop complaining. Friends like you are draining, bro! From a BMW to this! Just stop right here. Right here. Yoh, Babe! This feels like a dream. I don't know what I'd do without you. Don't worry about it. As long as we're happy. Calm and relaxed… I'm happy. Yeah but baby, you didn't have to sell your father's car. Don't worry about it, baby. We sold that car for a good cause. Look where you are now? But baby… this one is so old. -What? Which car? This one? This is Rosary. Give me two months with this car. You'll see when I pull up in here. -I'll show them flames. You will even get new friends. -And besides… I'm getting a Lamborghini with your first paycheck. - With my paycheck? - Yes. Thank you. I love you. -I'll call you. Baby… -You must drive safe. Love you. Babe! Babe! My sister relax. Gents, let's help. Don't worry. We got this. -Let's go, king. Ah! Let's go. Where did that lady say we are supposed to leave the trays? Um… I think there where it says 'Out'. Right there. By the conveyor belts? Yoh, friend! -It's like a dream. -Yoh! Why is it doing that? Okay… They go in there to get washed? Yoh! Mmm! What's wrong? Eish… It's just that, like… I'm happy being here but at the same time, I'm pregnant. I mean, I am going to show soon… and we eat a lot… You'll be fine, don't even worry about it… Oh, don't stress about it. Are you still my best friend? Of course. Best friend. That's my best friend. Cute… Who are you? Look at her hair, that poofy thing. Who did that? It's Neo from Zone 6 in Diepkloof. So, are you telling me that's your actual hair? - No… - Yeah. They crotched her and added extensions plus a wig. Okay, wait, guys. Are you telling me that total nobodies just joined this conversation? How is this any of your business? You don't know me, right? You don't know me? You… tell me… where you from? I'm from Soweto. How are you this pretty and you come from there? Yes? Right? Because there are no beautiful girls in Soweto? Hold on, guys! Is someone gonna shut this bitch up because she's been talkin... Okay! Jeez, guys. So, are you First years? Yeah… and you? Do we look like First years, doll? I'm sorry. Be careful of the Fuck boys on campus, they're a little tricky. I like you. We'll see you around. Bye. Why are you defending them? They're not your friends. Yes, but you don't know them either. Did you come with them? You also don't know them. Let's go. Let's go! When I try to start the car… nothing. So I ask Kedibone to help so I can kick start. Just before she starts to push… some guys came to the rescue. Come on, bro! Doesn't she use this car as her Uber? So if you have to kick start, she must push. - Huh-uh. Push? - Yeah. No man, c'mon. Mrembula there's one thing I don't understand about you. How can you… give up your whole inheritance for a girl you haven't even slept with? Not once. Not even once! Msithi, don't talk shit. You know very well I'm waiting for her to turn 21… then I can deflower her! Why do you act like you don't know what the deal is? When she turns 21? Yeah. What if you die before then? Should I… deflower her for you? -Three thousand… per month. - So expensive. - R1,500 a month? - Where are we going to get this money? - Buy airtime. We need to call them. To go and see them requires taxi money and… Hello… - Hello. - Hi. I overheard you are looking for accommodation. Hi. Are you a student? No, I used to be. But now, I am an acting lecturer. Oh, Acting? Me too. - I am a First Year student. - Seriously? - Yeah. - Okay. A young Thespian. Huh? Lesbian? - No. Thespian. - Thespian! I can already see you transforming into the different characters… and bringing light and shade and dynamics to the roles. -You go Thespian! Yeah. That's fantastic! So, where do you stay? Um… for now we stay at home. Yeah. We don't have enough money to pay for res. Oh…and these ones are expensive. These are all just exploitation of the African child. Huh? My friend owns the Bannister Hotel. Next to it, there's free accommodation. Free? It's like a backpackers. - What is a backpackers? - Backpackers? I can show you if you want. Yes. Here it is, ladies. Come in. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. No man! Why aren't there any windows? You know living in the city is expensive. Okay look, if someone moves out, you will get one of the other rooms. Woah!

Anyways, let's toast to being fabulous. No! Toast to me… This is about me. Why the fuck would we toast to anything else? - Okay, okay, we'll have it your way. - Yeah! And I'm not going to serve them because they think they are better than anyone from Soweto. Ha! Why are you being so negative? I'm sure they tip well with all that money. Their table is yours then. -And we'll share whatever they tip you. -Babes, it's my dad. - He's on his way. - Okay. Hi Franco. Let me help. -You're going to be fine. Hey! - Hey. - How's it going? - How are you? - Sharp. Where's my daughter? Um… she just quickly rushed to the bathroom. She's not feeling well. You drink girls drink a lot. - Daddy. - Hi, baby.

She just wasn't feeling well. That's all. Has anyone ever told how beautiful you are? No… But thank you… Sir. Huh-uh. Call me Franco. Sorry. Ah! You don't have to be sorry. The person who has to be sorry is the one who made this gorgeous… beautiful, stunning paragon of human perfection. Huh? Clean after drunks. No, no, no. I need his address.

Go to school. School is cool. Beautiful girls. Okay, so let's get back to this. When you say virgin… you mean like virgin? Virgin, virgin? Yeah… Like never used a tampon, virgin. Girl, do you know what your vagina looks like? Yeah. Does your man know what your vagina looks like? Yeah, but… I am waiting until I turn 21. That's cute. Let me tell you about my first time. It was super romantic. There were flowers, champagne. His parents are super rich, obviously so… He booked us out this hotel room. The sex itself was terrible. But the experience was just wonderful. Okay and… What does sex feel like? Sex is amazing! Sex is like… it's like God floating down from the heavens on a cloud and whispering sweet sensations into your ear. But most guys… Most guys don't know how to make you come so, girl, you gotta get on that dick and grind and you grind and you grind! I swear, it'll be amazing. Eish! That sounds… Sounds… rough. You know what. My first time… I know Mrembula is a very gentle guy. - Hmm-mm. - So he's gonna… kiss me. And he's gonna unbutton my shirt. Uh-huh! And he's gonna suck on my titties. Geez, you've got this thing down to like, every clothing item. And then he is gonna… Put his penis inside your vagina. I'm tired of swimming. I need to go home now. Thank you so much for everything. I will take you home. If you don't mind. Okay. Thank you. Let's go. You'll be safe. Trust me. Ah… Crayfish. So… this is it? Yeah. It's way smaller than your mansion. You don't have to be embarrassed. You have a roof over your head. Yes, but one day… You know, I'm gonna buy myself a life away from this place. And you know what that day could be much sooner than you think. - What do you mean? - I want us to be special friends and have a special friendship. Franco… What exactly do you want? You know what, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Just wait! Patience. Patience. Patience. Don't open your eyes yet. And now, open… What's this? Possibilities. Here… It's yours. Take it. - Uh, Franco, no I… I can't. - No, no, no. You can't be rude. Don't be rude. It's a gift. It's yours. Ahh… Yeah… Spend it however you like. Do your hair, your nails, the works… Have fun with it. Okay? Later. Jesus Christ! Woah! Beauty. What is this? It's a phone. Yeah but… I've got a phone. Yeah, I bought it for you. I already have a phone and it works fine. Huh-uh! This one is also yours. Huh? One more thing… I won a cellphone. You gotta be kidding me! You won a cellphone, just like that? No way! - Congrats, baby. - Thank you, baby. Actually, I want you to have it. There we go, there we go! Beauty. Go for it, go for it, go for it! Ah, this palette is so amazing! I should have gotten one as well. And these colours are gonna look so good on your skin. Fuck it, you are beautiful! Like I forget and then I look at you, I'm just like, "Oh my God, you're beautiful." And can I tell you something? Rich people love beautiful shit. Beautiful cars, beautiful houses. Beautiful fish. Great. Fantastic. I swear to God, Kedi… with that face… You'll have the rich falling over you. Opening every door for you. Will snatch that face… get you a good weave. Don't do that. That doesn't look classy. Afterall… I want to get you a rich man. Take you out of poverty. Woah! Comrades are really funny, hey. Seriously man, I'm telling you. If the tender is for R200 million… and Mbaks wants R50 million… give it to him. Just give it to him. How else are you going to get the next tender. Hey, cheers guys! -Cheers! - All the best. - Oh, politicians are very funny. Oh, they are very funny. - Hello, Bra D. - Hello. Quick word with you? Sure. What's wrong? Uh… Bra D, I wanted to know if… anyone has off days so I could work during that period? You want to work overtime again? Yeah, I need it Bra D. Your dad used to say the same thing. "I really need this overtime." And when I warned him about overworking himself… He said one day, he would buy this place. Is that why? Ah… No. Bra D. Bra D, I'm saving up for lobola. Huh? You want to get married? Yes, I do. Oh my boy… That's a beautiful thing. You can work the extra hours. Just make sure you don't break your back. Remember, after the wedding, you still need to consummate the marriage. - I hear you Bra D. - You know what I'm talking about? Bra D… - Thank you Bra D. - Do you have the experience? I need to go and fetch this car part that Msithi's been nagging me about. Okay. Thank you. -So… I swear to God, I am gonna tag you. Two thousand likes by the end of the day, darling. I promise! Okay? Average. Hey, Kedi… Is that not your friend? -Can you see your likes? Come… see your likes. That is a beautiful picture. It's pretty. So… who has to come up first and show us something? Kedibone. Why don't you come up? Let's show them something. So we sit down. We lock our toes. And we lock our hands. And we lock our eyes. And on my count… One… Two… Three… Let me not into the marriage of true minds. Admit impediments. We tried our best but you're not forgiving us. Love does not insist in its own way. Your name is Martha and you will work in that factory for a duration of six months. After which you will pack all your belongings and go back to those very valleys and mountains, where you will be greeted by smiles and giggles. From the children you've left for a whole six months. And they will be expecting gifts from… from that Johannesburg. But as you step onto your doorstep… you realise that all those gifts that were promised by Johannesburg… were intangible. That's it. That's it Kedi. Well done! Nice one. Rise of the African child. Good. Okay, I'll see you guys next week. - Alright, have a good one. - Bye, Sir. Kedibone… May I have a word with you. I was wondering if… -I can meet you in the dressing room… Once you've gotten your things. Just something that I wanna talk to you about. Okay… um… -Dressing room… I'll see you there. Okay. It's this side. Hi, Franco… Yeah. I know, I know. Can I just call you later? Bye. Rise of the African Child. It's a big play, you know. It's important to us Africans. And Kedibone… you're perfect for this role. It's as if it was written for you. You'll see. It's going to be wonderful. You're perfect. Just perfect. So, aren't we talking anymore? - Friend… - No! Don't "friend" me. I can't get hold of you. When I call, you don't answer 'cause you're busy with Franco… Wait, let me get my phone. I'm good, right? I'm good. I'm good. I think need the gym. I must get a personal trainer. And you could be the one. -Me? -Yes. - I wish. Yoh! - I'm telling you. I'll pay you. Look at that. Huh? Yes… There we go. Thank you. No, thank you. -For being a good friend. It's okay. I'll wait. I'm a patient man. Huh? Take care. Yeah. -Okay. The old man is exhausted! -I need to go now. - Look after yourself okay. - Okay. Have fun. Enjoy it. -Thank you. Alright… What's up, Crayfish! Woah! Hey, hey, hey! Yoh! We're celebrating, because I found an agency. - Mmm-hm. - Agency? Mmm-hm, acting agency. Oh okay, so… Those people who send you… - To television stations? - To auditions. - Yeah… - And then they're are going to tell you if you got the gig. Those type of things. -Okay. Okay. Got you. Babe. The necklace? Is that real? No, baby, I got from China Town. It's so cheap. It cost about R20. Yoh, no. It looks like… Like the real thing. They really know how to make these things these days. Ah, you know how the Chinese are. -I know them. Don't worry we'll be alright. Soon we'll be able to afford to eat crayfish. Hey? As well as… Lobster, huh? The high life things. Fuck it, you're beautiful! And can I tell you something, rich people love beautiful shit! After all, I want to get you a rich man. Take you out of poverty, you know. - Good day. - Hi. Take a seat. How can I help you? Ma, I actually came to… I want Kedibone's hand in marriage. I… I want to make her my wife. Hah! That will never happen. This child! No, that can't happen. - Why not? - No ways. Please hear me out. Kedibone… I love Kedibone. Are you ready for marriage? Or you think marriage is a joke. - I am ready. - Okay, forget that. I'll pretend that I'm Kedibone. Propose to me so I can see if you're as ready as you claim to be. Mmm! Okay… um… Uh… Put the ring on my finger! Kedi…Kedibone. K… K… Kedibone Ma… Manamela. Are you just going to keep calling her name? And not state your intention? If you're going to propose to Kedibone, you need to be confident. And not stutter, Kedibone, Kedibone! I will allow you to marry Kedibone but don't do what you just did ever again. This won't work. Go and practise! Use a mirror and make sure you know what to say when you talk to Kedibone. Go, go, go! It's a surprise. Wait a minute, wait a bit. Stand right here. - Okay, now I'm nervous. - Okay. Ready? -Ah! This is yours. Fully paid and all. Welcome home, Crayfish. What! This is so… Look at my view! No frickin ways! Phew! Hmm. Do you want a taste of this crayfish? Yes, Crayfish. Yes. -Ah! - - Isn't there a lift? - We're already here my guy.

So, tell me… the agent put all of this together? Yes, baby. All of it. Marble floors, marble kitchen, everything. - Just for you? - No, baby, with Tanya. This other girl from school. She is so cool. I also want this for myself one day. Wow! Yeah! Tony Montana views. The world is mine! I'm telling you. I'm telling you. Hey, hey! Are you jealous now, Msithi. We're here on the December 16 holiday. And I can't wait for us to make great memories, right here. - Right here? - Mmm… - Like… now? - Mmm-hm. Msithi… Go kick start the car, we're leaving soon. - I have to go. - Okay. Bye, baby. I'm telling you Msithi the first three weeks… I couldn't sleep… Thinking about how these rich boys might try and get with Kedi. Yoh! At least she got a decent place now. The one she used to live in was trash. Yeah, yeah. I agree. She's in heaven now compared to where she was. Tell me something. Is she only staying with her friend? Of course. And the agent is paying rent? Yeah, that sounds just about right. Have you met this agent? What business do I have with the agent? Have you met him? Do you even know his name? - Who are you talking about? - The agent. Msithi, how am I supposed to know? What's with all these questions? You should've asked Kedibone! I don't know anything about agents and how these things work. Okay, then. Don't get so emotional. Delivery for Kedibone. Kedibone? That's me. Rise of the African Child. You know, Dineo… This is a big play. And you are just the right person for this role. You and only you are perfect for this role. It's as if they wrote this play for you. Yes?

She said she'll invite the friends from varsity. Okay, but don't forget about the cousins. And the rest of the family. This is a big deal. I won't forget about them. It's just that I wanted to lay low because you know, it's a surprise. I'm aware that it's a surprise. I know how to keep a secret. What I want to know is do you have the funds to make this possible? Financially I'm sorted. I even got overtime pay from work. She's also found an agent. Everything is going according to plan. Hey! Wow! Thank God for that agent. He's a gift from above. Oh, now I'm convinced that this acting thing… You know… it's working for her. I'm also going to see if we can extend an invitation to the agent. You see, now you're talking.

Eighty thousand rand. Just for starters! I mean I am chilling with actors, colleagues, producers. How are you gonna get to know anyone in the industry if you're chilling here?

Am I a joke to you? I will tell you when to leave. I'm the one paying for this apartment. Do you hear me! And you still owe me. One last round. - Where do you think you're going? - Don't touch me! - Get off me! - You're my whore, I own you. Now shut up! Kedibone! Baby… He's the agent I told you about. Agent? Kedibone what's going on here? - Huh? - Guess who's in trouble now. I'm sorry, baby. Here's the story young man, listen carefully. I know this looks bad. But I'll save you the heartache. Kedibone? There's a lot of women out there and they're still gonna hurt you. I know because I was once a young man like you. They'll hurt you real bad. You see how full of fish the ocean is? Crayfish there, crayfish all over. And you know what you did? You chose one crayfish and… And you put it in the fridge. And left the door unlocked. What did you think was going to happen? I opened the door and helped myself to some crayfish. And it was appetising. I must say, your crayfish is delicious. Never tasted anything better... -Tebogo, please. Tebogo you're hurting him.
