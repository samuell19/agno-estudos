I'm jealous! Hmm, yeah. But it's not so easy living with them. That just sounds like sarcasm to girls who don't have them! They're a luxury to those who have them! But Takako, it's not like yours are all that small. They're a 'handy' size! Yeah, but I bet men treat you differently if you have ones like these! - Excuse me... - Huh? How would you like to get a tea or something? Eww, no. Or dinner? There's nothing good about breast implants! Uhh... My name is Wataru Yanase. Huh? - I'm sorry. - Why? - Yesterday... I saw what happened. - Huh?! I was, at the construction site. Why were you there? What did you see? I'm sorry! - It was my dad. - My breasts?! No, I mean, it was my father. I came looking for you. What's this about? Just tell me! Umm... Pull it together! He, assaulted you. - You... - It's Norio! My dad's name... Last night, I was following him. I thought, I should apologize. You were bleeding, after all. He hurt you. - It isn't like you did it. - No... ...but he's my father. The first was for the man who raped me. The second was for you for not stopping it. Can... Can you forgive him? Why are you apologizing?! Such a disgusting family. If you want to apologize, bring the person who actually did it! Then maybe I'll think about it. Idiot! If she brings charges what'll I do? I'm an architect at a stock-listed company! But if you're raping people there's something wrong with you! Hey, you should respect your father more. I do respect you! I mean, I could never rape... That's not a good way to put it. Let's switch. You're mom's passed on too. Are you gonna talk about mom's adultery again? I'm sick of it! Have you ever thought about it? If there's bad blood flowing through my veins... ...I might go crazy, might even kill you. That's why I never let you... ...play baseball or other sports that make your muscles grow fast. Stop thinking like that, you'll just make your mind all cluttered! I wish I'd just wake up as a bug one day... Come on, don't get interested in such absurd stories. Isn't it an absurd desire to go looking for big-breasted madonnas to rape? Snacks, snacks! Why is this all that's left? I wish mom would have stopped me from getting these implants... So will you meet her and apologize, or won't you? Why do I have to do something so dangerous as apologize to that girl? She's just so pitiful. It was so violent too. She was bleeding. Bleeding, huh? Apologize! Motomiya Miyuki... My conduct towards you was violent and humiliating. I am very sorry. For him, you are a mother, a sister, a wife. His E-cup Madonna. I'm going to leave. Please talk it out. That's the hammer of justice! Should I split your head open? I'm sick! When I see such large breasts, I lose control of myself. Can't you understand? How could I understand! Can you understand the misery of the girls you assault? Look, I apologized. It's 'cause I'm sick. It's too convenient just to sum everything up with the excuse that you're sick? Isn't it a sickness to get breast implants? Should I hit it and break the implant open? How did you know? I... They felt a little different, so I just guessed... Am I right? Do you despise them? No, if anything I want to support that desire. I guess you must be sick after all! Wataru asked me to get you to stop assaulting girls. You think that you can do that? Well now you've figured out that they're fake and I lost my confidence! Do you want to start over, from the beginning? What? You and me. Hey, Takako... About the girl I know who got raped, what do you think? He attacked her because he liked her. It's simple! You think so? But, I kind of wish I would be raped... Unlike with my boyfriend, it'd be so rough and wild. It makes my heart race! If I had an attractive body like you, maybe I'd be attacked too! Well, let's get to work! I can understand being annoyed by her, disliking her, even wanting to bully her... But then you'd be just like my dad. Actually, your dad said he wanted to date me. You shouldn't do it. But then maybe he'd stop raping girls. Mother, sister, wife, madonna... One couldn't be enough for him. If you know that for a fact then help me. Lend me a hand. If I keep going like this, I'm going to explode! It might be interesting to see you self-explode. Before that happens, I'll take your dad to court. No! I've had plastic surgery! I already know that! Where did you have it? My... Eyes... My eyes. My nose... And... ...down there. Where? My vagina. Stop it! Stop! I was scared. I am scared. If you go to sleep, it'll be tomorrow. - And if tomorrow doesn't come? - You'll remember today. - And if I can't remember? - You'll return to yesterday. I'll go back... and? You'll be a child and you will have nothing to fear. Hey, those customers over there asked if you'd drink with them. I don't even know them. Come on, just get crazy drunk and strip a little. That's why they came! This is a nightmare! - What'd she say?! - She said no. Well, tell her yourself! Come on! What are you putting on airs about! You've had plastic surgery, right? Where? I had my eyebrows lifted. That wasn't to your liking? Your son, why'd he run away? He didn't want to see my violence. I guess he was afraid of it. Then why did he come? Rape really is miserable after all. You may say that now... ...but your dissatisfaction and your anger will be resurrected soon enough. You don't think so? My son has taken to you. He really likes you. So, he's afraid of rape but he'll do what you tell him to. That's what I think, as his father. Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! Hey, the other day, you asked if we could start over, yeah? Was that just a statement of friendship? Or, was it a marriage proposal? Let's say it was the latter. You look like my mother. No, she doesn't. Hey... If you really mean it, eat this. It's not poisoned, right? There's some medicine in it that will make it so you don't want to rape anymore. So, you're saying to stop raping and to just be with you? Just as I'd expect from such an outstanding architect! That way, Wataru will have his peace of mind too. - There's just one thing I want to ask. - Huh? When I raped you, you bled. Were you a virgin? No comment! And certainly, you were shocked when he insisted that I apologize to you. - What's the point of asking me this? - Nothing. - I just... - I was a virgin. Here Wataru, eat this, it's really good! Are you playing 'pretend-family'? I'll be back later! What? What, even though you were late? - Well, I was hungry! - Didn't you eat breakfast? - Bread, milk, salad... - You're crazy! Do you recognize her? No, not at all. She's the older sister of one of the guys at my school. The first champion of the All-Japan Small Breasts Contest. Just the opposite of you. Her breasts are essentially flat. I see. Let's do it! Wataru... How about it? We only have until noon! Want to eat one? I don't want any! I'm saying let's sleep together! Come on, stop it! Let me go! No! Tell me where you had plastic surgery! Your eyes? Anywhere else? I wonder where Wataru is... Maybe he went out to rape after all? He's not the kind of guy that can do that alone. Still... He was different. What'd you say when you won the small breast contest? What was your acceptance speech?! Big-breasted girls are callous... ...but small-breasted girls are sensitive. That's why I'm happy to have won.
