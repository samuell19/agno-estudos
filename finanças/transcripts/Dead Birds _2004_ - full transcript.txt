[♪♪] [INSECTS BUZZING] [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] MAN: Good morning, Miss Shaw. WOMAN: Good morning, Seth. [BELL TOLLING IN DISTANCE] Halt. Prepare to dismount. Dismount. [HORSE NEIGHS] [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] May I help you? The manager in? Back there. Well, go get him. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] MAN: Yes? There'’s a soldier out here to see you. Ma'’am. SOLDIER: You MacCready? Yes, I am. Fred MacCready'’s the name. How may I help you gentlemen? Corporal Smitherman says you might have a place where we can put this. Did the, uh, corporal, uh, give you a message for me? [CLEARS THROAT] [♪♪] Hey. Look at that. [HORSE NEIGHS] Well, now, who are they? [QUIETLY] I don'’t know. Well, everything seems to be in order. Uh, sorry I had to check, but, uh, you understand security these days. Is there a safe we should be taking this to? Best one in the state. But first, you'’ll have to sign for it. Sure. MAN: Maggie, you go on home now. Now, where you men from? Camp over that way, about 20 miles to the east, near a swamp. GUARD: Is that right? Who'’s y'all'’s lieutenant over there? We ain'’t got a lieutenant right now. Captain Lewison'’s around, though. GUARD 2: What are y'’all doing here in town? Oh, we got some business at the bank. GUARD: Well, I'’m afraid you gonna have to wait a few minutes. [GUN HAMMER CLICKS] No. Can'’t wait. Now, you hold it right-- [GRUNTS] [FLESH SQUISHES] Nobody move! Yep! I don'’t think so. [MAN SCREAMS] SAM: Hey there. Did you get that teller, Annabelle? I didn'’t even see that. The bag'’s heavy, Joseph? [GRUNTS] Hell, yes. About time. [HORSE NEIGHS] WILLIAM: Here they come. Stop right there! Halt! [GUNSHOTS] [WAILING] WILLIAM: Wait up, little brother. Shit. WILLIAM: Y'’all ride on ahead. We got a ways to that Hollister place. [DOG BARKING] How many do you think will be after us? Not many at first. Those'’d be the only ones who could catch us. You'’re hit. Yeah, I know. I'’m fine. It's just in my shoulder. I can move it around all right. It'’s not even close to the bone or anything. [♪♪] Which way now? This way. CLYDE: William, tell us we ain'’t lost. WILLIAM: We ain'’t lost, Clyde. We got a couple more miles of this and then we'’ll be there. Hey, old man. You get you some deserters? Eight...today. [INSECTS BUZZING] We was looking for that old Hollister place. Hollister. Never heard of it. You sure about that? Should be a large farmhouse right past the creek. There are no creeks around here, not for miles. I'’ve seen servants upon horses, and princes upon the earth. You'’d best be moving on. We'’ll keep heading up this way. Can'’t be more than a couple miles out. He ain'’t got the slightest notion where we'’re going. Yeah, well... another good plan, huh? [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [HORSE NEIGHS] WILLIAM: Shoot. Crazy old man. [WILLIAM WHISTLES, CLICKS TONGUE] [DOG BARKS] [DOG BARKING] SAM: Do you see a pathway up to the house anywhere? WILLIAM: Must'’ve grown over. JOSEPH: Is that it? I said it'’d be here. [MAN WHISTLING] [INSECTS BUZZING LOUDLY] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] ANNABELLE: Hey. Come look at this. [♪♪] Looks like a man. Doesn'’t look like no scarecrow. Do you want me to take it down, Miss Annabelle? No. Just scared me a bit. Let'’s move on, shall we? [HORSES NEIGH] [DOG BARKING] [NEIGHS] [ROARING] Good shot, Sam. WILLIAM: What the hell is that? Jesus, Joseph. JOSEPH: Somebody shaved the skin right off that boy. TODD: Don'’t look like any kind of mountain cat I ever seen. JOSEPH: Looks like a wild boar or something. Let'’s get to that house. Sooner we get inside, the better. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Big storm coming in tonight, William. WILLIAM: Listen up. Let'’s get that gold inside. And bring your lanterns. We head out for Mexico in the morning. CLYDE: Who'’d you say runs this house? WILLIAM: No one. No one. It belonged to a soldier I knew once, but he'’s dead now, so... the place is empty, I reckon. SAM: Place looks deserted. No shit. I think we got that figured out. [GROUND SQUELCHES] What the hell? Just stepped on a bird. Yeah, come on. I want to get that bullet out of you before it gets infected. Yeah, all right. [DOG BARKS] Phweet! Dog! [♪♪] Oh, hell. TODD: What'’s going on? It'’s probably just some tramps. Let'’s look around and find '’em. There'’s only two of 'em. All right, but let'’s all be careful. It'’s real. It'’s real. Don'’t chew on the gold, Joseph. You and Clyde go have a look upstairs. Todd and I will check this floor. JOSEPH: I ain'’t never been in a house this big. So many rooms. Whoever built it must'’ve been pretty damn rich. I guess we'’re richer than him now, though. We ain'’t richer than nothing. Not yet, anyhow. How you mean? Don'’t hurt yourself trying to think or nothing, but right now that gold'’s downstairs. That ain'’t mine until it'’s in my pocket. That'’s for true. I'’m gonna feel a lot easier when we'’re in Mexico holding our shares. And if William thinks we'’re taking the same share as that nigger, he'’s got another thing coming. You check that room, and I'’ll look in this one. You hear me holler, you come running, get it? You too. [♪♪] [RATTLING] [DOOR HANDLE RATTLING] Todd? TODD: I think I heard something. You can'’t get it open? [SIGHS] No, it'’s stuck good. Doorknob turning. It ain'’t locked. [SIGHS] Well... we'’ll find something to pry it open. Let'’s come back to it. [WIND WHISTLES] [GASPS] Anyone here? Come on. Come on, get out. Oh![LAUGHS] Why'’d you do that? Hey, I like to breeze through the trees, corporal. Anything in here? No. Did you find anything? CLYDE: Just some clothes. Looks like a guest room or something. The bed'’s still made. Let'’s check the barn out back next. Yeah. [GROANS] [GROANS] There. You'’re done. [COUGHING] Oh! Goddamn it, Annabelle! That'’ll do. Could'’ve told me you were gonna do that. Stop whining. Ow. What is this place? TODD: Slave quarters. There'’s a book over here. WILLIAM: Any of this mean anything to you? TODD: They'’re spells... for raising the dead. How much you figure our share to be, looking at that gold? Less than it should. Sure would be easier if we was to divide it by two, instead of... We got... That kid already got a bullet in him. I reckon you could take care of our lady friend. WILLIAM: You find anything in here? CLYDE: No. It'’s empty. [THUNDER RUMBLES] Might not be a bad time for a storm. It could wash away any tracks we left. Uh-uh. Ground'’ll be muddy tomorrow. Leave tracks that'’ll last for days. You hear me ask your opinion, boy? '’Cause I didn't. Ain'’t no boys in here, speculator. I wouldn'’t speculate on you. I wouldn'’t have no use for you, none at all. I don'’t see any pine trees for you to hide behind up in here. Oh, boy, I'’ll knock those eyes straight in your head. Shut up, the both of you. [JOSEPH LAUGHING] Yeah, I wonder how they got up in there. There ain'’t no ladder. [THUNDER RUMBLES] CLYDE: This place is going to turn me into a little girl. Well, if there was anyone here, they'’re long gone by now. Come on. JOSEPH: Ante up over there. That'’s it. I swear... Five... Hit a winner. Mmm... It'’s me, isn't it? How much you got? And don'’t lie. Two. Two. Two and one, that'’s it. You holdin'’? They said there were some beds upstairs. Want to go lie down for a while? [CHUCKLES] Damn. Come on, what is it now? [GRUNTS] [BED CREAKING] [ANNABELLE MOANING] JOSEPH: Three. Another three. My bet. Joseph, come on, now, boy. JOSEPH: I got a... I'’ll go five. [♪♪] [WOLF HOWLS] ANNABELLE: Do you remember the hospital where we first met? First time we talked after you woke up? You, me, Jeffy Hollister... when he told us about this place. Did he ever say anything about the folks that he inherited it from? Yeah, some great-uncle or something. Had he ever been out here? I don'’t think he had. Carried around all those maps. Mmm. It was awful watching him go. He called me "Belle." I wanted you the first time I saw you. Annabelle... I think I killed a kid in town today. Did you see it? [SIGHS] I'’m out. I'm done. Wise decision, nance. Wiser than our friend here, who'’s looking to lose his share of the gold afore he gets to count it. SAM: You know, Clyde, you'’d be a lot better at bluffing if you played it down a bit. See your three. I'’m up five. [THUNDER CRASHES] JOSEPH: Hell, I best to get these horses in... before that storm hits. You do that. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] JOSEPH: Yeah, I bet you tired as I am. [HORSE NEIGHS] It'’s been a rough day, hasn'’t it, boys? Nothing to worry about, now you in here. Storm ain'’t gonna hurt you none. You did good today, Passion. I'’m gonna get you all fed and watered now. I guess you don'’t need this. I do. Be right back. [SNORTS] [♪♪] [WATER TRICKLING] [FROG CROAKING] [WATER SPLASHES] Hmm. BOY [FAINTLY]: Please, help me! Get me out of here! Is somebody down there? BOY: Please, mister, hurry! Let me outta here! Can'’t see you. My daddy threw me in here! Oh, hell! My-- My Lord! I'’m gonna throw a bucket down to you. Hurry! Damn! Hurry! I'’m cold! Just grab hold on it. I'’m gonna pull you up out of there. Hurry! You got it? All right. All right, grab hold, both hands. Uh-huh. Come on. [GRUNTING] Well, damn! [GRUNTS] Damn! What...? [JOSEPH YELLS] [THUNDER RUMBLES] You okay there, Sam? Mmm... I don'’t know. This thing'’s itching me. Means it'’s healing. Yeah. I guess so. SAM: How long do you think Joseph'’s been gone? [THUNDER CRASHES] [♪♪] [WOOD CREAKING SOFTLY] [MAN COUGHING] [GURGLING & GAGGING] [MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [MEN COUGHING] MAN [IN DISTANCE]: There'’s more Injuns coming. [GUNSHOT IN DISTANCE] [HORSE NEIGHS] [MAN COUGHING] Belle... ANNABELLE: I'’ll be back for you, Jeffy. Isn'’t she beautiful? I think she'’s the most beautiful girl I'’ve ever seen. Soon as I heal up and get out of here, we'’re going to get married. She told me so. [COUGHING] JEFFY [WHISPERS]: Bastard... Bastard! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] What is it? Joseph'’s gone. What do you mean, he'’s gone? He'’s gone. He disappeared. He went to take the horses to the barn, and he hasn'’t come back yet. We'’re all out looking for him. I'’ll be right down. Todd and Clyde are out back. Are you coming? Yeah, I'’ll be along in a minute. [GROANS] [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] [SAM WHISTLES] Dog! [WHISTLES] Joseph? [BRANCHES RUSTLING] BOY: Over here. You seen him? No. I thought I heard Dog out in the cornfield. I went out after him, but... I must'’ve gotten turned around in there or something. Well, you couldn'’t find your way out there in daylight, much less at night with a storm coming. Yeah.Joseph! [THUNDER RUMBLES] He'’ll either come back or he won'’t. Let'’s all keep our pistols handy. I got to take care of something. I'’ll be around in a minute. [♪♪] WILLIAM: We shouldn'’t leave the gold unattended again. We'’ve been lucky so far, especially with those two around. Do you think they'’re playing at something serious? Things are different now. From now on, one of us three stays with the gold at all times, no matter what, at least until we figure out what'’s going on here. Got that? Yeah. All right. [GROANS] [SCRATCHING] Dog? [WOOD RATTLING] Shh! [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Hey. Hey. Hey, now. [THUNDER CRASHES] [FOOTSTEPS] [DOOR CREAKS] BOY [WHISPERS]: Anna... [PATTERING] [GASPS, SCREAMS] WILLIAM: Stay with the gold. What is it? There was a boy in here. A boy? He ran out. You all right? Yeah, I'’m fine. It just-- It just scared me, that'’s all. Maybe it was the light. Was this a young kid?Yeah, he was young. He was small. If there was a boy here, Sam will find him. We'’re the only ones on this floor. WILLIAM: Could he have gone out a window? SAM: I don'’t see how. He didn'’t go downstairs. We would'’ve passed him. Yeah. You sure you weren'’t dreaming?He was here! He could'’ve gone out another way. If there was a boy here-- It wasn'’t a dream, William.[GROANS] Sam? Sam? Sam. On your feet. You all right? Yeah, I'’m fine. I just got queasy after running up all those goddamn stairs. Okay, you need to lie down and get some rest. No, I'’m all right. Just give me a minute. Lie down. Come on. [GROANS] Annabelle... I believe you about the boy. Get some rest. [DOOR CLOSES] [♪♪] [RAIN FALLING] [VOICES WHISPERING] I didn'’t say that I don'’t believe you. No, you just said I had a bad dream. I heard you the first time. Ah, Christ, Annabelle. Sam'’s wound's infected. He'’s not gonna be in any condition to ride if it gets much worse. All right, fine. You got any suggestions? It'’s just that... there'’s something wrong with this place. There was something awful about that boy upstairs. Why can'’t we just leave now? Well, there'’s no chance of us going anywhere tonight, not in this. And we can'’t just leave Joseph here, he could just be passed out somewhere. What'’ve you been doing? You see Joseph come by? Could'’ve sworn I saw him moving around in there. WILLIAM: You sure it was him? I saw a head and shoulders moving through the rows, but... WILLIAM: What? Then I didn'’t see it no more. It'’s either him or something pretty big. [VOICES CHATTERING] [FOOTSTEPS SCURRYING] [SOFTLY] Our Father, thou art in heaven... [ECHOING EERILY] My parents used to lie together in this bed. This is where my mother was when the consumption took her. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil... [CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] I had to do it. I put the children... where they'’ll never be found... by anyone. I tried to bring my wife back, but they tricked me. They changed my children into demons. Who are you? Where is my wife? Where is she?! Where is she?! [METAL CLANGS] [COINS CLINKING] Clyde here says he saw Joseph and Dog. At least it was some kind of animal. We planning on keeping this gold out all night? We'’ll stand watch over it. Why? I say we divide the gold up now, so we'’re each carrying our own shares. Seems safer. And I said... we divide the gold up when we get to Mexico, not before. Doesn'’t make any sense, William. Joseph'’s missing, we don'’t know where. Way it is, Clyde. Part of this gold is mine. And you'’ll get it... when we'’re out of the country. It'’s the way I say it is. That'’s final. Ah, doesn'’t make any difference, I guess. I'’m gonna go get some rest. You do that. [CHUCKLES] [♪♪] [THUNDER RUMBLES] [THUNDER RUMBLES] [THUNDER CRASHES] [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [SPEAKING STOPS] [SPEAKING RESUMES] [VOICE SCREAMS] [METAL THUMPS] [GUN HAMMER CLICKS] [ROARS] Sam! Sam! [CREAKS] [FAINT CRY] Who'’s there? How'’d you get in here? [CRYING] Hey. Listen, kid... you need to tell me if there'’s someone else in this house. Did something happen? [SCREAMS] [WOMAN WHIMPERS] How'’d you get in here? [SOBBING] Oh, please. Please help me. Please let me go! I didn'’t do nothing. I won'’t tell nobody about the others. The others? You a runaway? I didn'’t see nothing. I didn'’t. I didn'’t see nothing. Damn it. They used rawhide on you. They used rawhide on you. Oh, God, it hurts! Yeah, I know. I know. Please help me.Shhhhh. Hurry! Hold tight. I'’m gonna cut this off you. [SOFTLY] Oh, God, he'’s here! What? [WAILS] He'’s here! Oh, God, he'’s here! He'’s here! Oh, God, he'’s here! Help me! I don'’t see anything. Shh. [QUIETLY] Hold on now. Just hold on. Hold on. [SCREAMING] No! No, God! I don'’t see anybody. [SCREAMS] Joseph? Sam... The gold. Clyde. [GRUNTS] Clyde! You stay here with Annabelle, you understand? Sam... Where'’s William? Where'’s the gold? Will'’s taking care of it. What'’s that? A door. Page from that book. What are you talking about? It'’s no door that you would understand. It'’s for sacrifice. First, all the slaves... all the cheap ones and the females past their prime. You have to follow certain rituals to be heard. Most think of them as spirits and ghosts. But they have always been here. They exist in a world around our own. Sam-- They want to change what is in this world. They wanna...torment us. I don'’t understand. [GASPS] Annabelle... this really hurts. I think something'’s wrong. All right, let me-- Let me look at it. [PANTING] [WHIMPERS] Ah! [QUIETLY] What is that? I don'’t know. Sam, we have to get you to a doctor. You have some sort of an infection. I may be able to get you something for the pain. No. It don'’t hurt no more, Belle. What? What did you just call me? I want to show you something. Here. Come on. Come on. Don'’t you want to see what they did to me? You were shot, Sam. I was there, remember? No! Preacher said shooting'’s too good for me. They just left me out there to rot for what I did. Sam, what'’re you talking about? [GROANS] Sam? Sam... Sam... I can'’t see-- Stop calling me that! [SCREAMS] [MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Stop this! Where did you put the bodies? Where are your children? Where they belong! Hoist him up there! I'’ve opened the door. They'’re here forever! PREACHER: Fine. We'’ll see you get a taste of hell in this world before you pass on to the next. [LAUGHING] You'’ll see! Just wait! MAN: Come on, Jeffy. You'’ll know, neighbor! Hollister!Just you wait and see. You have no idea. [MUFFLED SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [GASPING] Todd! Joseph! Where the hell are you, goddamn it? [DOOR CREAKS OPEN, CLOSES] What is it? I saw everything. What exactly did you see? What'’s wrong with Sam? I don'’t know. Sam? He'’s dead. What the hell happened here?! I don'’t know.What, was it his wound? No, it'’s this place! This place did something to him! What do you mean, "this place"? Why would Jeffy Hollister send us here? What do you know about this farm? What are you talking about? It was a trap, William! TODD: The farmer that lived here, he sacrificed his slaves... in some sort of ritual... to bring his wife back. He killed them because they turned into beasts... demons. I saw it. We need to get outta here, William. Sam'’s dead, Todd. WILLIAM: Where the hell have you been? We need to get as far away from this farm as we can. We'’re not leaving here without the gold. The gold? Yeah. The gold, remember? We left you here watching it. ANNABELLE: Two against one, Todd. What are you thinking about? TODD: I'’ll kill him, Miss Annabelle. You ain'’t that quick. Maybe. He won'’t be lonely long if you do. Should'’ve left when I had the chance. You watch yourself. I'’ve ridden with you a long time. I saved your life more times than I can count! That don'’t make it yours. Put the gun down, Todd. WILLIAM: You had no part in this? That gold don'’t mean nothing now. It'’s gone. No. We find Joseph and Clyde, and we find that gold. [VOICES CHATTERING] Did you hear that? What? Now it'’s gone. Todd. Forget about Joseph and Clyde. Your brother'’s dead. Let'’s just get on our horses and get the hell outta here, right now! I don'’t care what you decide. It don'’t matter what you do. [THUNDER CRASHES] WILLIAM: Todd! Wait just a goddamn minute! [TODD LAUGHING] ANNABELLE: Look at that. What could'’ve done this? Looks like I'’m walking! What the hell could have done this to the horses, William?! [VOICES CHATTERING] WOMAN: You are damned. Do you hear that? WOMAN: You are damned. Hear what? [CHATTERING CONTINUES] WOMAN: Drop them here. Bring me back. My husband will... Your new nature will be revealed. [TODD GROANING] No more. TODD [SOBBING]: I can'’t trust my eyes anymore. There are worse things than dying, you know. I'’m not leaving here without that gold! I am. Annabelle, if you want to leave, you go with Todd. I'’m staying here. [♪♪] Sam'’s not dead. He walked outta here. It didn'’t look like he was walking anywhere. Well, he'’s not here now! He was dead, William! Whatever took his body took it to keep us here. We have to find him. William-- Listen to me! [UNEARTHLY ROAR] [PANTING] [ROAR INTENSIFIES] [ROAR] [SCREECHES][SCREAMS] [ENERGY ZAPS] What is it? WILLIAM: Someone must have come through here. Let'’s keep moving. No. Hold on a minute. ANNABELLE: Let'’s go. WILLIAM: No, wait! That'’s Clyde up there! [MUFFLED GROAN] Here! WILLIAM: He'’s all tied up with hemp. [WHISPERS] Let'’s go. Hold on. ANNABELLE: Oh, my God! What'’d they do to him? Have you got your razor? [BOTH SCREAM] Slow down! Annabelle! William! [RUSTLING] William! William, where are you?!

Gave me a bit of a scare. Unless y'’all are fixing to eat it, just leave it alone, goddamn it. We need to get. Mount up. SOLDIER: Captain. Maybe some of us should check the house, sir. They came this way. Johnson and I can check the area and catch up with you later. All right. But I want you back with us before sundown. Move it out, men. We'’ve wasted enough time on this. What'’s this all about? Here, look at this. Is that gold? Mm-hmm.Where'’d you find it? Get off me, will ya? Right here. Must'’ve dropped it. All right. Come on. SOLDIER: Johnson? JOHNSON: What? Here'’s another one. Another one? Mm-hmm. Damn, he'’s ugly. [♪♪]
