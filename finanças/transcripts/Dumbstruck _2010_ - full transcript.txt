Mike check, check. Check. Check. Hey, check-a. ♪ Pull the string, and I'll wink at you ♪ ♪ I'm your puppet ♪ I'll do funny things if you want me to ♪ ♪ I'm your puppet in 30 minutes, this place is gonna be crazy with ventriloquists. ♪ Pull the little strings, and I'll sing you a song ♪ ♪ I'm your puppet a lot of times, the vents are really isolated, like, "Hey, I'm the only vent in my town," and they don't have anybody to talk to. So, here they get to talk to people. Yeah! Yeah! Actually, quite a few ventriloquists who started out initially were quite shy and are still shy, and that's not an uncommon trait among ventriloquists. ♪ Treat me good and I'll do anything ♪ ♪ I'm just a puppet, and you hold my string ♪ ♪ I'm your puppet Welcome, everybody, to the 31st vent haven convention. What do you think of that? 31 times we've been here and done that. About 450 come every year -- as far away as New Zealand, Australia, Japan. Do you speak English? No. I don't think I'm playing with a full deck. Come on, boy. What are you betting? I came to my first convention, and I just fell in love with the people. Everyone's so friendly, and everybody is like me -- talk to themselves and play with dolls for a living. Our next contestant, Kimberly Yeager, will now take the stage with her special friend, Carson. ♪ I've been everywhere, man ♪ ♪ I've been everywhere, man ♪ I actually got my start with the miss Ohio pageant, and I got to do my ventriloquist act, the only ventriloquist in so many -- I don't know how many years. Our talent winner this evening is Kimberly Yeager. Our swimwear winner is contestant number 18, Kimberly Yeager. The new miss Ashland, number 18, Kimberly Yeager! She made miss Ashland, made miss Mansfield, and then was in the miss Ohio, and she really loved it. But she had always played with the little puppets and... But I thought it would kind of end as she got older. That's a nice outfit. You need another color on him. Yeah. I've got the perfect color. Okay. Okay. Come here. I'll show you. All right. We've got eyes here. Eyelids -- he can blink, blink, blink. And this is what it looks like inside. Upper lip, nose. And if it's all going, it looks something like this. Do you want to try it on him? Here -- we'll put it on him. That's good. My name is Dylan Burdette, and I hopefully will be the next best ventriloquist. So, here's 13-year-old Dylan Burdette from down the street! Reggie -- I guess he considers himself a pimp. You know? He's been interested in it since he was 5, so I can't ever remember a time when he wasn't playing with puppets. My mom's kind of supportive of it. She takes me here every year. She's the one who buys me all the dummies. I'm not really sure what my dad thinks of it, but I think my dad wanted me to get into other sports, so... I don't quite understand why Dylan picked a black figure to use, but that's his choice. I've always wanted to hopefully find publicity, to maybe get the word out that I'm a ventriloquist. And who knows? Maybe I'll be able to be professional. I'll get discovered. Welcome to vent haven museum. Is this your first time, then? Yes. The number-one element to being a successful ventriloquist is you have to be funny to be good. If you're technically perfect at it, you might get very polite applause and very appreciative applause, but I don't know that people would come back to see you time and time again unless you are very, very funny. Little Gary, say "Hello." Hi. I saw your mouth move. Oh, uh... Hi. When you're a kid, you don't think about whether you're good or bad. You just do it because it's fun. And I was beat up a lot for being a sissy. But I didn't care. I liked it. ♪ Ahhhhh It wasn't until I got into college that I was suddenly in amongst a whole bunch of different people that didn't know me. That's where I brought the puppets out of the closet again, and things started to go completely the other direction. Instead of being picked on, I was suddenly popular. Shut up! Let's play cards! Why don't you play that pair you got? They look good. Think again. I need more drink. Excuse me. Bird here. Bird here. Bird here. Bird here. Excuse me. Excuse me. I can't walk very fast. I don't want to lay an egg. Pretty much the rest of the family wants nothing to do with this, and they always try to tell me to stay away from my aunt, also, but I was in rough times, and my aunt was the only one that helped me out, so... I'm going down to get drunk. I can say things through the characters that, if I said it myself, I'd be fired, I'd be slapped in the face or beat up. But they can say stuff and get away with it. She was working, I think, as a security guard, and she got beat up pretty bad, and they had to wire her jaw shut. And of course they said, "Well, you can't talk." That's not gonna stop Wilma. So that's how she started to work on the ventriloquism, and she found a way to talk with her mouth wired shut. Testing, one, two, three. Everybody, beware of the puppetmobile. I want to thank you for another great convention, and see you again next year. Safe travels, all right? Since I was 10 years old, I've been wanting to go to the ventriloquist convention and never was able to. I was too young at first, and then I was working, and it was either money or go to the convention. Oh, no, a ventriloquist. Oh! Ho ho! Ho ho! What is your name, sir? My name is Terry Fator. And I'm Emma Taylor. This is Emma Taylor. I'm a singer. Yeah, she's a singer. Show us what you got, man. All right. Hit it. What? Wait. What are you doing? What -- Wai-- Emma, do you know who that is? Yeah. You're gonna do an impression of her? Yeah. All right. Emma Taylor. ♪ At last wow! Whoa ho! ♪ My love has come along Wow! Up until just a very few months ago, we were really, really struggling. I would, you know, look up every single venue that was possible for me to play, and it just never worked out, never worked out. And so I was out there, you know, mowing lawns and painting houses and just trying to keep ourselves afloat. I mean, I knew how talented he was. And I just kept telling him, for years and years, "It's just a matter of the right people seeing you." All right. Terry, I have to tell you real up straight-- when you came in, I thought, "Oh, lordy, lord, not again." But you are quite brilliant. Thank you. You really are. I think you're on your way. Anyway, that's just my opinion. Thank you. I work full time as a ventriloquist. I did 482 shows last year. You hungry, puppy? Here. Jasper, you are so spoiled. I work for the officer Phil company, which books me in all school assemblies, and I do shows all over different states. We utilize magic and ventriloquism, with a safety message. Lucky, what does a duck use if he were to break his wing? What would he use to fix it? "Duck" tape. If a duck were to get sick and he needed some medicine, who would he go to? A "ducktor." Lucky, what do you call a cow and two ducks? I don't want to do any more jokes. What? Come on, lucky. I don't want to do any... Lucky. You guys are making fun of me. Oh, no, no, no, lucky, you know -- oh, boys and girls, I see what happened here. He thought we were laughing at him, making fun of him. Hi, baby. Go bye-bye? I'm at a point in my life where I'm 31 and I've been working for the same company for 7 years now, doing children's shows, which I love, you know? But I just want to -- you know, I really don't have anywhere else to go. Thank you, mommy. Sometimes I wish she would get out. I mean, "Kimmy, just... Find someone, get married, have kids." "Mom, these are my kids." I mean...You know? I don't mean, like, settle down, like she's wild or something. She's not wild. Just -- you meant settle down and get married. Yeah, and have kids instead of her... Puppet children... ...that she does. Down here, this is, like, my main room, where I have my puppets and all the stuff that I kind of loved. I was engaged at one point. And, you know, the whole wedding thing just didn't work out. All the way there, from the top to the bottom, two rows of, like, wedding stuff that never got used, so I just stored it. 11 30-gallon tubs of wedding stuff. So I'm set for the next one, if I ever get married. You're so hot. Give me a kiss. Oh, stop it. Get out of my face, you pervert. Hey, what's that mean? I'm not gonna tell you. Tell me. No. I feel like, a lot of times, I'm like, "What am I doing here in this town?" And just -- you know, I just -- there's something waiting out there for me and I just -- I'm ready to get to it, and I'm just not there, and I'm here. I just feel on edge, you know, 'cause I want to get there. This is our boat. We're going on a charter over to coco cay. Hi, mom. Hi! After what happened to me with, you know, my last relationship, I went on a cruise with my sister, just a weekend cruise, and I performed with Bertha. I just brought her along, and I said, "Hey, I'd like to -- "I'm a ventriloquist. Can I do a little bit in the show?" I want to get me some fried chicken and mashed potatoes and grits and okra and green beans... It was just so magical. Everyone laughed. They loved it, and they were like, "If you ever want to do cruises, let us know." Give it up for Kimberly Yeager. The big thing is, you know, I put my dreams on hold for the last person I dated. I did, and I thought I was gonna have a different life with him. And then that didn't work out, so now it's like I'm back to square one, pursuing -- my dream I've always wanted to try was cruise ships. So I'm not gonna let anyone stand in my way this time. I've worked for several of the cruise lines for a number of years now, and pretty much that's all I'm doing anymore. It's a lot of fun. It's taken me all over the world. We are here in San Diego, California. And I'm just starting my season working the Mexican riviera. Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Cruise ships are very much like the latter-day Las Vegas now. They're putting on big, splashy shows, and they're bringing in name entertainment, and people can come into beautiful theaters. Setting sail -- it's a lot of fun. You're embarking on an adventure, and it feels like that. You need to sing into the Mike. Otherwise, the audience can't hear you. Is it on? Yes, it's on. It's on! Don't do that again. All right, now, just -- Stop that, all right? Sing into the Mike! I'll bet you want a signature, don't you? Yes, I do. You have such talent. Oh, that's so sweet of you. Thank you. I am considered a headliner act on the ship. I mean, I'm excited about having this because I'm only one of just two or three ventriloquists that work this line. So, you folks were at the show last night. Oh, yeah! Oh, well, thank you. Thank you. In the ventriloquist world, really, the top of the heap is cruise ships, and that's what you really want to get to. I tried, man. For years, I tried to get -- I did. I've seen a lot of ventriloquists. Dan's technique is unbelievably good. Part of the illusion and magic of ventriloquism is you have to create -- that character has to be completely apart from you. What's your name? John. John, I'd like to say two words -- "Rogaine." I'm kidding! That's one word. John, do you like games? Yeah? How about peek-a-boo? Don't do that! It's taken me years and years and years to hone the craft and to write the material and to get the timing down. John, he's manhandling me! You're just sitting there! I've never seen you act like this. What is your problem here tonight? Cassandra? I want -- The way to really be successful, though, is to try to reach a level of performing where you're consistent, where people feel like they're seeing this for the first time. They want to feel like they've witnessed something unique and in-the-moment. Cruises -- this is a really good opportunity. It pays well. It's exciting because you're traveling. If there is a downside -- and this is a big one, I guess -- is it does keep you away from your home and your family a lot. I met my wife in the lobby of the theater where I was doing a show, and we're about to celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary. So, it was ventriloquism that brought us together. I'm on the road a lot more now than I used to be, and we're both very independent people, we're both very committed to each other, and we just make it work. When I do ventriloquism, it actually does feel like I'm talking to another person. I can't explain it. It just does. I mean, I know that kind of sounds weird, but it actually does. It's just out of this world. I feel like I'm different in everything that I do, and all my friends think that ventriloquism is strange, but it's just something that I love. This is a place where I like to think without being bothered by anybody. I've got, like, a little DVD player over there, where I watch my acts to see how good I am. Over here -- I always set my dummies on this so I can kind of look in the mirror, watch my lip movement, and look at my performance. I kind of just like practicing by myself. Once I get my act perfect, then I like to show my family, but it still hasn't been perfected. It's just kind of memorized in my head. Dylan, for being 13 years old, is probably about the smallest kid in his class. And it's been that way for a long time. He's just very small. Dylan is a very quiet, shy person, until he gets onstage. And then he's totally different. And I think it's because he has his friend. It's like you have someone up there with you, and Reggie is the one doing the work. And Reggie -- Reggie hasn't been having any girls come here lately. That's why you... I know he's very passionate about the figure and doing the ventriloquism. There's a lot of kids out there that are playing football, and they have to practice twice a day, 11 months out of the year. So, I think those guys are also pretty passionate about what they do. This is my motorcycle right here, this yamaha yz250. I've been riding since I was 9 years old, so I've been at it for a long time. Now, with the motorcycles and some of the other activities, I can kind of coach him a little bit. When it comes to ventriloquism, I don't know anything about it. Motocross-- I'm not the best. I mean, I'm pretty good. I just don't feel like I'll ever be good enough to become pro. I've had a couple of wrecks, and you've had a couple wrecks, but... ...Entertainment. This is Dave. Hey, Dave, this is Dylan. Dylan? After the last convention, I kind of thought, you know, one show isn't really enough per year, so I decided to kind of look in the phone books, call every talent agency, and I contacted them. I called and said, "Hey, do you hire ventriloquists?" The whole thing's been Dylan, and he called this place, this talent agency all by himself. So, it's all been Dylan. I have very little to do with this. Is this an act that you've done before? Uh, well, I just wrote the script about last week, so... Do you have other pieces that you've done in the past? Yes, I do. Okay, bring some of that material, too, so it's not just a totally fresh act... Dave-- he said, you know, "You're 13. "I'm sorry, I can't really hire you, "but if you'd like, once you're 14, "you can come down to the amazing portable circus, "and we can talk to you and see if you've got any potential "for when we can hire you. And you can come down here and see what it's all about." This is Dr. Fred. Whenever somebody in our family or somebody I know is in the hospital, Dr. Fred makes a visit and checks the patient out -- not out of the hospital, but checks the patient out. Come on... Attaboy. I went in the hospital. They thought it was a stroke. My whole left side went numb. So she brought in Dr. Fred to cheer me up. Well, we were making so much noise. It was like, after about five minutes, you forget that Wilma's there. You just start talking to Dr. Fred. Wilma's a very good person. If you're in trouble, Wilma is right there on the spot. Wilma sticks out and -- for good or bad, she sticks out. For a woman that's 6'5", she is just a bundle of joy, and she's just fun to be around, and she just puts herself into it, and she loves people. God uses what gifts you have. And if your gift is ventriloquism, that's what your medium should be. When I entertain, I love going the whole nine yards, decorating for my sets and all. I've done a few shows at maranatha. They're just a great bunch that come to that church. You remember the ostrich. I've put together what I believe is my best show. They will never forget this show. Hi, there. How you doing? How you doing there, cutie? Hi, there. Hi-yi-yi-yee! Hi! You look hot. Let me cool you down. Okay, now, you guys have just saw me draw this face. Are you moving your eyes? No! Okay. Can I have your name? No, it's mine. Oh, okay. And -- and what is your name? Art. Art -- that's a good name for a drawing. I thought the show was great. I mean -- but then, I'm prejudice. We have a special guest here. Here is none other but tigerman! Everybody go, "Rah!" Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Come on, let me hear you say, "Rah!" All right, we'll get started here. Let's clap your hands. There -- you can stand up. Now clap your hands. There you go. Now stomp your feet. Movement is good. Here we go now. Come on. Shoulders. Everybody, who am I? Tigerman! Who am I? Tigerman! Who am I? Several of them came up to me and even thanked me for deciding to have an extra added attraction in the show. ♪ We need love try to stand up, everybody, whoever can. ♪ We need love nice and loud. ♪ We need peace ♪ We need peace ♪ Around the world ♪ Around the world ♪ We need love ♪ We need love ♪ And peace ♪ And peace if I do a show and I just get one person to just forget their troubles and laugh, I've done my job. And today, I saw more than one person laugh. I mean, we had the audience -- well, I can't say falling in the aisles, because they were supported by their walkers, but... I did a show, and there was one 12-year-old kid at the show. And about 10 minutes into the show -- I'm doing the show -- I'm thinking, "Oh, well, it's only one kid, but I'm gonna go ahead and do a good show for him, anyway." And about 10 minutes into it, 3 teenage kids come in and sit down, and I'm thinking, "Thank goodness. Finally I'm getting a crowd." About five minutes after that, a guy walks in -- and I'm in the middle of my show -- and a guy walks in and tells the three teenage kids, "All right, let's go to work," and they started folding the chairs up. And I'm going, "Uh, well, I guess the show's over." It was horrible. I was so discouraged. And there were shows like that, where I would call Melinda and I would say, "Honey, I just don't know if I can do this." America has decided. The winner of "America's Got Talent" and the winner of $1 million is... ...Terry Fator! Way to go, brother. We've got one more surprise for you. We know your dream is to play Las Vegas. Well, we're gonna make that dream come true. Home to some of the greatest entertainment in the world, and it is all yours, Terry Fator. What a night! Congratulations to our $1-million winner, Terry Fator! A big, big round of... So, when people come in now, this is what they'll witness. And they're assuming they're just seeing your everyday ventriloquist. Okay. But unbeknownst to them -- go ahead, Sam, if you'd raise that curtain. Oh! Oh, that is cool. That is unbelievable! Incredible. I just -- I cannot believe it. Wow. Come on up and see your new chest. A place to hang the jacket, all the Cher stuff. Oh, my gosh, it's all here. You know, I used to think about winning the lottery all the time, and I would pray, I'd be like, "God, you know, please let me win the lottery. Please let me win the lottery." And it was like a voice in my head one day said, "Look, I've given you everything you need to win your own lottery. Now get out there and do it." And I went, "Okay." And I quit buying lottery tickets, and I started working on my act. Except most people who win the lottery don't get their name in 8-foot letters. Those are 10-foot. 10-foot letters. Okay, yeah. And we might put them on 2-foot risers. For somebody like me, it's truly mind-boggling. I -- you just -- you know, I mean, I'm 42 years old, and I've lived a completely normal existence up to now. And now all of a sudden, I'm staying in this suite. All right. Thank you. Enjoy the show tonight. The one and only Terry Fator! So, what are you gonna start off with tonight? I'd like to do my theme song. You have a theme song? I do now. Since when have you had a theme song? Since I won "America's Got Talent." Wait a second. Wait. You won "America's Got Talent"? Well, duh. He went from playing Ferris festivals to playing the Las Vegas Hilton, all within one year. And now we're getting offers from just about every major hotel, wanting to build the Terry Fator theater, which is his lifelong dream come true. My father, no matter what I would do-- I would do a show, and my dad would say, "Well, you're really not that good, but you're good at making people think you're good." And I was thinking -- so, all this time -- all my life, I've thought I was a fraud, and I thought that the house of cards was gonna come tumbling down when everybody realized I wasn't really that good. Terry Fator was talking about his drive and his passion, and it took him 10 years to get an act in Vegas. He's one in a million. You know? I really think, though, the first step is that drive because if you have the drive, and if you have the desire, you'll find a way. So, I guess the natural step for a ventriloquist, after you get to a certain place, is to go on the cruises or to go into corporate or to -- the cruise industry has changed a lot, though, in the last few years. The cruise lines really prefer to work with people that will go for longer periods of time. And when you're away from home, if you're on a ship six to eight weeks, it's very hard to start up relationships, to maintain relationships. Unless you meet someone on the ship and get married. I was just gonna say -- I know some people that have met other people while working on a ship, but that's rare. Now, my dogs -- I love my dogs, and -- oh, I just don't know. Most likely, you wouldn't be allowed to travel with your dogs. How could I leave my dogs for two months? I mean, how do you do that? How do I leave my kids for two months? That's -- that's a hard thing, but if I don't, I can't put a roof over their head and food on the table. Hi. How you doin'? Come here. I'm gonna give you a kiss. You want to give me a kiss? Oh! You go lay down. Lay down. Lay down right now. I'm really excited about tonight. Yes, because I'm gonna showcase my adult routines and -- you know, 'cause I do kids shows most -- the majority of the time, it's kids stuff, so I definitely need the practice. I need to get my puppets out there and showcase, you know, the adult shows. ♪ Oh, say, can you see ♪ By the dawn's early light ♪ What so proudly we hailed ♪ At the twilight's last gleaming? ♪ Well, tonight we're at the miss Mansfield pageant. They're doing a thing where they're bringing back all the former miss mansfields throughout the years, and I was miss Mansfield 2000. So I'm here, and they asked me to be a performer. So I'm gonna be doing my talent after intermission. No way. Unh-unh. I ain't gonna do it, Kim. Okay, we'll come back to that. So, the only thing left, really, is talent. Talent? I ain't got no talent, Kim. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are proud to present to you 12 intelligent young women who tonight will vie for the title of miss Mansfield. You have a really skinny waist. Yeah, well, things don't grow well in the shade. Kimberly has asked me to videotape her tonight. She's trying to put together a package that she can use to send out, sort of like a tryout tape or an audition DVD. What were you thinking, getting me up here on this stage, Kim? Well, you always said you wanted to be in a beauty pageant. Now, this is your chance. Now, let's look at the positives. I ain't got none. Come on. Now, you have a really skinny waist. Yeah, well, things don't grow well in the shade. Bertha, come on. Delayed reaction, Kim. Yeah. They'll get it. Okay. We're in Mansfield. Bertha, like I said, you look really pretty tonight. No, I don't, Kim. Look at these teeth. Heeeee. These teeth make me look like a horse. A horse? Every time I go to the racetrack, they try to put a saddle on me. Bertha... Do you want me to comment, like, on all the things I hate? Well, you always said you wanted to be in a beauty pageant. Now, this is your chance. Now, let's look at the positives. I don't know. I hate to watch myself. No matter if I do good or bad, I hate to watch myself. I just -- I need to learn to be a good critique of myself, but -- I'm working on it. This is kind of the point where I am coming out of my comfort zone. Now it's, like, time to, yeah, make new relationships, meet people that can help me in different ways, you know, 'cause my goals are different now. The only person I could really think of that would work out great would be Tom ladshaw. You know, I've come a long way. I've got a lot of characters that I think are really cool and would be good for a cruise ship. Tom ladshaw -- he's a great guy, very well-respected in the vent community. I think he's somebody that really would be good for me. But I need someone to help me get my "act together." I understand, but ultimately, then, the final goal is the cruise ship. Yeah. Here's what I can do for you. I can help you build the act, step by step. You already have the characters, which -- that's the biggest part of the battle. Now we'll put together some material for you, material that is going to work in the particular venues -- the cruises. And then, once we've got the act ready, once we've done it a thousand times and polished it, then we're going to contact some people. You know, I don't know what my future holds. You know, I'd like to get married. I'd like to have children. I would like to do cruise ships. All this has to fit, and I don't want to be 40 years old. I know this is something I'm just -- I'm passionate about, and I'm aching to do it. When my dad gets out there, I think I'll beat him. He always makes up the excuse that, oh, if he gets hurt, then he can't work, so... He couldn't keep up. Give me a chance. I got to get warmed up. Yeah. I'm working up a pretty good sweat out there, and it's gonna keep me wide awake when I do that audition later on, so... Well, since I'm turning 14 soon, I called Dave at the amazing portable circus. I asked him if I could audition. It'll be just such an honor to have Dave sign me as a client. All right, the basics of fire-eating -- one wand, a little fire, one big idiot -- that's all you need. There you go. Now, you have to be careful 'cause sometimes when you're working with magic rope, it'll actually play tricks on the magician, just like I play tricks on my audience. Sometimes, if I'm not paying attention, the ends will actually slide from one side of the rope to the other, just like that. Audiences want an expert. They want to be in the hands of somebody who's a master. And Dylan's biggest holdback might be the fact that he's 13. So I'm eager to see where he's at, talent-wise, but I'm more eager to see how he presents himself. You're Dylan? Yep. Nice to meet you, sir. We do a lot more than just ventriloquism. We have 30 entertainers that work with us on a regular basis. They all work for us exclusively. One of the pieces of paper that I'll be showing you is the noncompete that they all sign. In exchange for that, they get training. In exchange for that, they get lots of work. If you are anywhere in the greater Cincinnati area and you see living statues, that's us. If you are anywhere in the greater Cincinnati area and you see stiltwalkers, with the exception of one guy, it's always us. We dominate. That's great. And we do it on purpose. You ready to perform? I think so. Awesome. All right. Uh, well, hello. I am Dylan Burdette, and, as you can see, I am a ventriloquist. And, uh, with that -- All right, the bell you heard is the phone, so sorry about that. Let's just do it again, and good luck. All right. And with that, I'd like you to meet my right-hand man -- yeah, no kiddin'. Yeah. Uh, this is Reggie. What's up? So, um... Let's see. So, Reggie, uh, you know, I understand when we came down here, we didn't really have an act. So, in the car, we just kind of discussed what we'd like to share our views and opinions about. Yeah, I know. So, uh... Uh, all right. Let's see. Tell me, uh... Uh, I don't know. Maybe I should ask you the questions. You want to ask me the questions? Yeah. All right. Sure. Uh, well, aren't you ever afraid somebody might not laugh at your jokes? Uh, I don't know. I don't really know the meaning of the word "fear." Yes, but you also don't know the meaning of most words. Dylan, here's where we're at, you and I, as far as -- you called me wanting a job, okay? You're not at the place where I could book you tomorrow. Okay. But I think you could do a birthday party. And I think you could do a school show. And I think you could do that this year. But there's a lot of work that goes between where we're at today and there, okay? I was really surprised to see that he did a brand-new piece for us today. I'd rather have seen him do something that he's well-versed on. I actually said that to him on the phone, too. I'm like, "you don't have to do brand-new material," for the exact same reason. I mean, he didn't do that for anybody, so he had absolutely... Exactly. Same thought. I'm pretty happy with my performance, considering I didn't really have, like, all year to practice and perfect that act. But you looked like you were pretty sad about -- about what he was saying. To me, you appeared sad. Mnh-mnh, no. You weren't sad? Nope. Okay. You got to pay your dues, no matter what you do, sometimes. You know? When -- when I'm falling apart, I can't get these characters to cheer me up because they just -- even when they try to talk to me, they crack up, too, and I mean crying. And... But I don't have any tear ducts. Well... "Warning -- your property is about to be sold without your consent for delinquent taxes." I guess some people, when you get in this desperate situation, they turn to their family. Wilma went one way, and they're the other way, and that's the way families work. Her brother and my mom want nothing to do with her... ...nothing at all. Like, if they seen her on the street, they'd just keep walking. They wouldn't even say hi to her. There's several reasons I'm not in good with my brother and sister, but the main reason is they hate what I'm doing. And they hate ventriloquism. She had medical conditions when she was younger, and she pretty much chose differently than what everybody else would have thought of doing. And that's why nobody really wants nothing to do with her. My whole family pretty much told me I was living with Wilma too long, but I don't understand that one. Wilma's helping me out. I'm getting cleaned up. The only thing I have left to do is reach out for another family of mine -- my ventriloquist family. "Hi, everyone, normally I try to keep my private life secret, "but I'm at wit's end. "And they say that, when you have a problem, tell someone. "Since you're the closest to my relatives that I have, "I'm hoping that one of you can help me "continue my ventriloquism. "If I don't come up with $1,079.42, my house will be sold." "Unless god comes up with a miracle, I'll be homeless on the 23rd." My son -- he disappeared from me at the age of 5. He was taken away from me because of problems with my ex and my ex mother-out-law. I never called her an "in-law." She was always an out-law. My son -- well, I call him Billy, but he's now William, Jr. Billy went looking for me one time, and they found out that he came over to my parents' house, which was his grandparents' house. When my mother-out-law and my ex found out about it, they said that I had died, so he wouldn't stop. But he still came over 'cause then he started trying to find out where I was buried. That's when they came up with the cremation idea. When I found out that, I... I-I died, emotionally. Because of Billy, I've dedicated my life to entertaining children. I can't wait till you learn how to dress yourself. Konnichiwa. Okay. Now, you notice it's not just the hand. It's the head moving, too. Do you want to try putting her on your knee? We are in Osaka, Japan. I'm here to share what I do with the Japanese ventriloquists here. Well, we're gonna talk a little bit about manipulation and moving of the arms here. Okay? So, we've got that. Maybe we've got a little -- a little scratch there or a little fixing of the hair. Dan horn's amazing. His manipulation is impeccable. He's the best ventriloquist I've ever seen manipulate a puppet. And when I go to pick him up... Okay. I'm gonna plop him down. If the puppet has no movement, it has no life. It's got to have some movement. But it's got to be lifelike movement. Think of the movement as coming from your wrist, and everything else is going to move around that movement, as if there was a string here. It's not just this. It's this. A lot of what I'm seeing is just very puppety-like movement because nobody is giving any kind of fluidity to the puppet. They're not -- they're not grasping that it's supposed to have weight and mass. You are very lovely. I'm only recently being introduced to what the Japanese culture dictates for their ventriloquists. Somebody told me, "oh, you hit your puppet. You never hit your puppet." Well, I don't -- I don't go around going, "well, somebody said I can't hit the puppet, so I'm not gonna hit the puppet." It's foreign to me to think that the people here don't have that kind of freedom and to not have the freedom to say, "oh, yeah?" Aah! I'm sorry. Hey! I'm sorry. You can't hit the puppet! Yeah, I don't have to listen to you. Oh. Domo arigato. Mwah! Mwah! I'm having a wonderful time. But I have to go right back to work on the ships. The thing with the ships is, if you're not doing the work, they're gonna get somebody else. I was thinking that, if you came on in San Pedro, then you could at least go down as far as mazatlã¡n, which is where I get off and switch ships. Yeah, I know, that's what I thought, but I thought it was worth at least -- well, I know. I just thought it was at least worth asking if maybe there was some way to make it work. I really miss seeing my wife. That's the real price you're paying when you're doing this kind of a job, and it's really difficult. Check, one, two. "No business like show business" comes up, and the announcer says, "and now, all grown up and back in corsicana, it's Terry Fator!" Okay. Well, we are so excited to have Terry here tonight because he's "hometown boy makes good." We are very proud of corsicana. We are known as the fruitcake capital of the world. We sold out both shows in the first day. We sold over 1,200 tickets. We had people waiting in line at 4:00 A.M. in the rain. Thanks. It's so good to see you, Sarah. Oh, my god. So many of these people here in corsicana know Terry. They remember seeing him onstage here 20 and 25 years ago, or they know his family. It was very, very nice. Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you. Okay. We didn't have a lot of money growing up, and so we were constantly getting evicted. All of a sudden, you've only been here for a few months, but the next thing you know, you're all packing up and you're moving again. And so I was very lonely as a kid. I started magic when I was eight, and I got really good at it. I could shuffle one-handed, you know, both hands, and I was able to conjure coins and all kinds of things. And one day, my dad just -- he came in, and he said, "you're practicing too much. You're obsessed with this." And he took all my magic stuff and threw it away and said, "you're not allowed to do magic any more." And so, when I started doing ventriloquism at 10, I was just absolutely determined that my father would never see me practice. So that's why I would practice when I was doing janitorial work -- because my dad would drop us off at a building, and I would sit there, and we would work for hours, and I would sit there and practice and sing songs without moving my lips. ♪ La la la la la la la la la la la ♪ Mr. Terry Fator! Thank you so much for coming tonight, ladies and gentlemen. You see, I am a ventriloquist. Get out of here. I did not know you did that. Well, I do -- yeah? Do some for me. You want me to do some ventriloquism? Yeah. Right now? Yeah. In front of all the people? Yeah. What -- you're putting me on the spot. What do you want me to do? I want you to say, "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers," and don't move your lips. "Therefore, I Clifford brown, "the mayor of the city of corsicana, "do hereby proclaim Thursday, January 24, "as Terry Fator day in corsicana and encourage all fans and friends to participate in this event." Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Unbelievable. Wow. Wow. My goodness gracious. Well, it was a lot of fun, and I did see a lot of family, but I didn't see my dad. He didn't -- I didn't really expect to, but he did not show up, so... Good afternoon, and welcome to the mirage. Well, today I'm here to announce that we are continuing the tradition of great entertainment with the signing of Terry Fator. I'm overwhelmed and so incredibly happy. It's been a goal of mine to play in Vegas for a long, long time, and, of course, to get my start at the Hilton and then come here is just beyond my wildest dreams. Cindy, can you get Terry a pen? Oh, my. Terry, just sit here, and Scott and I will be on each side here. Okay. It didn't register, you know? You just -- you read this in the paper. You don't -- it happens to other people. This doesn't happen to me. This happens to the guy you read about. This is a pretty cool office, huh? It's kind of nice. Any more? And he's got his own parking spot... Is that it? And then, like, later, I went, "Oh, my gosh! I just signed with the mirage!" Our next guest has so much talent, after struggling for years, he has just signed the biggest deal in Las Vegas history. Say hello to Terry Fator. Well, I'm very excited. This is where I meet with my comedy writer, which is pretty wild to have a comedy writer. I've always wanted one. And now I have one. We'll do a lot more of this tomorrow. I've been writing for Terry since the beginning of the year. They wanted to get the show funnier as fast as they could. And after 20, 30 years of putting a show together, now he's got a year to make it go from a really good show to a perfect show. You got to have some people help you. Winston losing his -- all the money -- I mean, bad choices -- huge laugh. Wait a second. What? You won $1 million? Yeah. Well... If you're a millionaire, why didn't you retire? Why are you still working? I made some bad choices. You know what makes the bad choices so good is because the turtle's head goes down. You know, "I made some bad choices." And everybody's made bad choices. Like what? Well, I gambled half of it out there in the casino. He should say, "they comped my room," just like he says, "I made some bad choices." You gambled half a million dollars in the casino? Yeah, but they comped my room. I think that's cute. Melinda even added on to that. She said, you know, how about we comped the room, "and I got a free buffet"? A free buffet -- I think that's really cute. And I got a free buffet. The team comes up with some fantastic ideas, and Terry, because he's been an entertainer for so many years, puts his own little twist on everything. So, what did you do with the other half a million? I spent it at the turtle ranch. When I first came to work with them, I thought the show was about a six. Now I think it's an eight. I think in a couple more months, it's gonna be a nine. Then it's gonna take a year to go from 9 to 10 because that's really hard. I would love to move on to do cruises. That's what -- I do want to do that. Yeah. I would so love to, like, lay on a ship and do nothing and sip nada coladas and And do shows and just... Yeah, I think I would like it a lot. Hey, hey. There she is. Come on in. It's good to see you. You too. How's everything? All right, come on in, and we'll get started. We got a long day ahead of us. We do. Yeah. Wow. I'm excited to finally be here. May I take your coat? Yes, thank you. I don't think it'll fit, but I'll grow into it. My sister and I are going on a cruise in June. What I would suggest doing is let's see if we can get this ready over the next couple of months. And when you get on the cruise, talk to the cruise director, tell him you'd have some time. And treat it as an audition. And when it's over, say, "well, what did you think? "Honestly, I'm ready to do this, and I'm available. What can you do for me?" The one number-one, main, biggest, primo thing that we're gonna work on is material... Good. ...because that's the key to the act. That is. Bertha -- let's talk about her. Okay. I got a real problem with Bertha. Oh, no. I think you didn't go quite far enough. Do you like Bertha's voice? Um, here's the thing -- she's the beauty queen, and that she doesn't know what all the fuss about you is about -- she's the beauty. Right now, Kimberly is simply playing her as a country girl from wherever, and that's funny, but it's not nearly as funny as it could be. I think that's -- no, I don't want to hear what you have to say anymore. No. Get out of here. I mean, oh, my gosh, changing a character after using it for so long -- it's like renaming your kid and giving your kid a new personality and getting used to it. I mean, it's like they're my kids. You can't be on a cruise ship and have kids. I mean, I still worry. I mean... You do? Yeah. Now, if you're on cruise ships, what if someone throws you off or does something? See? Now I'm gonna worry about that. Mom worries. I mean, but I don't know if -- I don't know if you should quit your job and do it or -- you'd have to, wouldn't you? Mm-hmm. And then what if it didn't work out? It's the end of the season now, and it's been about seven months. There has been some un-- unhappiness. I-I just recently did learn that my wife and I are going to be splitting up. And so that's -- and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm away from home so much. So, after 25 years of marriage, she's decided that she just doesn't want to be alone anymore. Well, I would do it differently if I could, but I don't know how to do anything else. This is the only thing that I have done and the only thing I'm trained to do. I-i...don't know what else to do. We've mostly been doing this all by e-mails, and -- which is very strange. It's very impersonal, but it's also, I think, been good in the fact that we haven't been able to let our emotions speak freely and say hurtful things. I'm thinking that I really would like to go somewhere and just get a really, really strong Margarita. All right. Eh. So, what do you got going on tonight? I'm so hungry. I got the key. Two hours of sleep. So, I'm here on the cruise with my sister, Laurie. Oh, wow, it's tiny. We got the cheapest room possible, and our beds are very small. This was a ton of work to bring it all on here. So, she has her crown. She's now a diva. I hated being in the bag. I ain't got no body. I know. We'll change that in a little bit. Oh, good. I got a whole new outfit made. She had a breast reduction right here, yeah. Everything is, like, kind of new on her, and now I can just totally look at her and see desmerelda. I don't even see Bertha. I do a different voice with her now. Get me a real diamond, Kimberly. We'll see about that. Hello? Hi. Great. Great. You too. So, I just went to the information desk, and they paged Jimmy, the cruise director, to see if I could meet with him and talk to him about performing. Would it be possible to talk in person? We're set. I got a meeting. Hey, it's a first step, step number one. Hi. Are you Jimmy? I am. Hi. Nice to meet you. I just asked him. I said, "I do this. I'm a professional ventriloquist. I'd like to break into the cruise-ship industry." And first he said "no" right away. He said the vice president is on the cruise and they just -- everything is perfectly timed out and they just don't have any room for it. And I said, "just a 10-minute opening." And he's like, "well, let me check and get back to you." So, he's gonna put a letter under my door. Aah!aah! Hi. Hi. Aah! Aah! "Due to the nature of this particular cruise, I am unable to allow you to perform." Hmm. "There is just no room in the schedule that allows it." Oh, really? "Many apologies, and we hope you enjoy your cruise vacation." It's got to be the fact that there's 2,400 people on here and they don't know you from any other passenger, even though Tony knows you. I mean, I offered to do an audition today. I mean, they don't understand how much I want to perform. They obviously don't, or they would have given me five minutes. Tony? Tony, the hotel director -- is he available? I don't think so, no. He would be on the other side. He'd be over there? Over at the other offices. Okay. Thank you. Stressful. This is stressful. Very stressful. Well, good luck. This has been my dream. I mean, it would be five minutes in the show, but it would mean the world to me. Even if I -- even at the end of the show, if you say, "hey, if you'd like to stick around, we have a passenger that wants to debut a 5-minute thing --" yeah. We can't do it. We cannot. Is there any way I could talk to the vice president and just explain to him, like, I'm a passenger, this has been my dream? Here's somebody just gave me $50. Another one just -- I can't believe -- it was $100. Now this one -- $200 from one of my ventriloquist friends. And then others sent me $10, $25, which -- every little bit helps. Totally astonished. Totally amazed. They're my real family. I think it's really wonderful that she has this ventriloquist family all over. I think Wilma is very blessed to have them, and I think they're very blessed to have Wilma. I can't thank them enough for their generosity. But it shows how tight our ventriloquist family really is. I will see many of them at the convention this summer, and I'm going to thank each and every one of them, maybe even give them a hug. I won't kiss them, in case their wives are around. I'm ready to go. And I'll start doing this. This means it's almost done because I'm trying to get people to cheer. Tonight is my very, very first show as the real headliner at the mirage, and tonight is the real deal. So, it actually starts. It's been about a year now since I said that the show was at a 6 on a 1-10 scale. It's at a 10 now. I am so grateful that I get to be here. You just don't know what it means to me. You will never -- nobody will ever understand. Come on! Come on! Bam! That's what I'm talking about. So, people wonder -- what do I do before I'm ready for my show? Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together! Terry Fator! When he was 14, he would talk about headlining in Vegas, and tonight is the culmination of everything that he ever dreamed about. ♪ At la-a-a-st ♪ My love has come along I think, you know, he kind of felt at times like maybe, you know, he had passed his prime because he's 42. But, you know, I always felt -- and I think he knew this, too -- Terry's talent is timeless. What he does -- there's no age on it. ♪ Oh, yeah, yeah ♪ At la-a-st ♪ The skies above are blue it was -- it meant a lot. Um...that was one of the most exciting things and one of the most awesome things for me as a mom. ♪ ...Night I looked at you Thank you. So much has happened this year, and I -- there's one thing, though, that I cannot wait for, and that is the convention. This year, I actually get to go. ♪ Pull the string, and I'll wink at you ♪ ♪ I'm your puppet ♪ I'll do funny things if you want me to ♪ ♪ I'm your puppet how are you? Our convention's a lot like a family reunion. We have people who have been coming year after year. So good to see you. It's so fun to come back 'cause you see a lot of people that you've known over the years. This is Mr. T. Rex. I put the beard on, the jewelry, and he pities the fool that doesn't watch him. ♪ I'm yours to have and to hold ♪ ♪ Darling, you have, you have so much soul ♪ ♪ I'm your puppet ♪ Yeah, yeah hi, everybody. Did you fix the camera? I think he's incredible, and last year, when he won "America's Got Talent," I mean, the vent community was overwhelmingly happy. I just think that has all made a huge impact on audiences, and that has created a new excitement about -- in fact, new audiences like this ventriloquism thing. "This is really cool. What is this?" I haven't seen any ventriloquists really before. I just knew the ones in Sweden and Terry Fator. Great. Wonderful. Yay. Thank you, Terry. It's really nice meeting you, finally. Is this the new Julius? Yes. Yeah, I'm Julius. How you doing, Julius? I'm a singer. I have been saved by my ventriloquist family. I actually now have enough money that I can actually save the house from the sheriff. Now, there's just no way I can thank them, but that's how solid of a family we are. Hey, hey. What's up? Hey, Tom! How are you? How are you? It's good to see you. Hey! There's this person named Robin Cahill, and she's kind of the talent scout. So, we're gonna have you perform here, and Robin's gonna watch and say, "gee," you know, "here's some undiscovered talent." All I need you to do is one thing. You got to sign up on the open-Mike thing. That's what she's gonna -- 'cause she wants to see you in an audience with other people. Okay. Is this the order that we perform in? I don't know, ma'am. So, without any further ado, ladies and gentlemen, the enchantress of song, the mistress of melody, miss desmerelda divine. Thank you. Thank you. You're lovely. You're too kind. How you doing? Oh, my gosh, I've followed your career forever, for many, many, many years. I have followed yours as long as I knew you. Nobody knew me until... Back in April, I was torn about whether I should, you know, jump ship and head home and try to see if there was something that I could do to salvage my marriage. But my wife didn't want me to do that. She wanted me to stay on the ship. As sad as it is, I'm a performer, so this -- I made -- I made the only choice I could make, and that is to be who I am. I saw you in Las Vegas, and I just -- and I just, I went up and met you after the show and talked to you. This was like two or three years ago. Oh, okay. And I told my wife, "my gosh, this is one of the best puppet manipulators on the planet." I'm just so impressed with your work. Even when I'm unhappy as an entertainer, I'm still happy as an entertainer. I -- even when I don't want to go out onstage, I'm tired, I'm -- whatever's going on -- when you're out onstage, I'm really happy with what I'm doing. I love what I'm doing. So, what else did you do for fun? In the casino, I made 500 bucks. Oh, that's great. What was your strategy? Start with $1,000 and lose half! Coming up next, we have a 14-year-old. He likes coming to conventions, meeting all of his friends, and going to the vent haven museum. Please welcome to the stage Dylan Burdette! I felt like I was just gonna pass out. I mean, I felt like my knees were shaking. I mean, I could feel my face getting hot. That was not a good sound. He's getting taller. It's finally-- you know, he's finally getting there, to where he's not gonna be a-- I was afraid he was gonna be, like, a midget or something. To have my mom there in the audience was kind of embarrassing but also kind of funny at the same time. She always says I don't listen to her enough... Or something like that, I don't know. I guess I -- Dylan met a couple girls a couple weeks ago, and they showed up for his act today. I didn't think they'd actually want to come, so... He was really good. I thought it was really funny when he started, like, flirting with the girls. Kimberly -- oh, yeah, that's right. You sold me this fine outfit. Yes. Yes, you did. It looks good. I guess having a dummy might make me a ladies' man. I don't know. Dylan. All right. I'm just very excited to meet you, and I'm so glad I got to see you perform. I liked your routine. It was very clever, very creative, and I'm excited to see what you do in the future. I think you're gonna be okay. Yeah, me too. Everyone here is a lot like family to me, so a lot of people were congratulating me, and it was pretty fun. I don't know if I'm ready to go pro yet or not, but I'm just hoping maybe one day I'll be world-famous like Terry Fator. So, you look great. You look really good. Thank you. Think you're ready? Yeah. Like, I just heard that Robin Cahill's here. They're one of the biggest cruise-line agencies around, so... And I hope it goes well. I'll be out there pulling for you. Thanks, Dan. I appreciate it. Oh. Well, good luck. Oh, oh, wait. I'm not supposed to say that, am I? No, don't say, "break a leg." This is my puppet. Oh! Oh! Very good body. What? Style is very nice. Yeah. He's checking me out. She does 500 shows a year throughout the United States, and this is the 501st one. Here she is -- Kimberly Yeager. Ladies and gentlemen, the star of the stage, screen, television, and supermarket grand openings, the enchantress of song, the mistress of melody, miss desmerelda divine. Oh, that's terrible! You just can't find good help these days. First message. I dated George and Ben. Clooney and Affleck? No. Washington and Franklin! So, what did you think? Well, I guess it was okay, I guess. You guess? Yeah. So, uh, we got like two or three minutes. We'll go debrief and talk about it and go over it. We can do that? Yeah, yeah, okay. You ready for the bad news? What? I didn't want to tell you this beforehand. She didn't show up. Yeah, but you know what? Now, seeing it -- now we're gonna be able to watch that video and tweak a few things, tighten a couple of things up, and make it that much better. Okay. I think a couple more times of doing it in front of a crowd, and you'll start getting that feeling. That's the feeling I got. Yeah, me too. Like, I felt that way, too. I'm almost glad she didn't see it because that was really your first time running in front of an audience, and that's never when you want the agents to see you. Okay. Well, thanks. Thanks for the advice. I appreciate it. I really do. I'm glad I was here. So -- yeah, me too. Thanks, Dan. Okay. We'll see you later. That's all. Okay, Wendy, now, how would you like me to do your hair today? Well, I'd like to get it dyed because it's too light. We're gonna put a cape on Wilma so she doesn't get all hairy, too. Okay, we're gonna swing you around a little bit. Whee! I like this! Did you? Good. So, what kind of show do you do, Wendy? Oh, right now I'm getting ready to get married to my fiancã©, Fred. Fred? That's really nice. How long have you gone with Fred? Three years. Three years. We haven't even had sex. Oh, okay. Okay. That's a little bit -- a lot of information. Thanks, Wendy. You're welcome. To celebrate my house being saved by my vent family, we're gonna have a wedding at the convention. Dearly beloved, we've come together today, in the presence of god, to witness and bless the joining together of this man and this woman in holy matrimony. If any of you show just cause why they may not lawfully be married, speak now, or else forever hold your peace. You better not! The exchange of wedding rings has been removed from this ceremony, due to the fact that Fred and Wendy's fingers do not come apart. I now pronounce you husband and wife. Fred, you may now kiss the bride. That's right, you were telling us about these characters. This one is 107 years old. That's 100? Mm-hmm. Now, this is obviously restored, right? Yes. God, that looks great. That's it. Yeah! I went over to the vent haven museum for the very first time. Where's Lisa? Lisa, can you come up here for a second? She took me on an amazing tour of the vent haven museum. I'm 43 years old. It was the very first time I'd ever had the pleasure. First of all, I wanted to tell you that I'm donating the money they're paying me to you guys, but I'm also gonna donate $10,000 to the... So -- yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much! You're so welcome. Oh, my god! Are you serious? I'm serious, yeah, yeah. That is such a meaningful thing for us. We operate on a limited budget, and $10,000 -- we have to work for that kind of money. It's such a gift. It is -- it is just a wonderful, phenomenal thing for him to do. I can't believe that he is that generous. It's awesome. You want to say something? What do you want to say? Yeah. I just want all you people here to know that I love you very much. Thank you, Winston. Thanks for saying that. You know, I couldn't have said that better myself. Go ahead.
