Yeah, the youth down here is really violent. I mean, I've been beat up, I think about, maybe, three times in the past two weeks. Um, I don't know, it's kind of rough. I mean, I've been punked for my backpack before; I've been punked for everything I own. A girl named Scrapy, she came up while I was asleep and took my backpack out from underneath my head and dumped out all my stuff, gave me a smaller backpack, threw it at me and then took my big ol' backpack; it was like a big traveler's backpack, and I tried to get it back and she wouldn't give it back to me so. Why do you think people mess with you? Because I'm young, because I'm new. And so this is where I usually sleep. I usually put my sleeping bag down on the rocks and or, uh, sit up here. If I'm like hanging out with people this is kind of like where we sit; we sit on the ledge. We usually hang out, do whatever. When I, when I come down here, I mean, if I'm down here just by myself I do think about my family, I guess. I kind of don't just wonder what they're doing, I wonder how my dad is. My dad hates gays, which is his exact words. And he says because I'm gay that I'm not his kid and all this other stuff. He bust a couple of my ribs, which was the last altercation that we had before I just said I was done. I haven't seen my dad since then. I don't know, down here it's kind of hard. The thing that's hard for me is getting to sleep. Because when you sleep down here, you know, as for instance, you're sleeping on rocks, or you're sleeping on cement. You know, it's kind of hard to get comfortable when you've got a backpack for a pillow. Um, Kayla is my legal name; the reason why I changed it is because I'm a transgender. The fact that I'm a girl really does not make me happy. - How does that feel? - Does that feel liberating? I don't know, I guess it kind of makes me feel better, you know? I guess it makes me feel more comfortable because, I don't know, it just makes me feel like I'm more comfortable in my own skin, you know? It makes me feel like I'm one of the guys, whatever. You know? What would your dad say if he saw you like that? If my dad saw me he'd probably kick my ass. "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!" -Emma Lazarus When I had to sell myself for shelter, um, yeah, I thought about my family and wondered why they couldn't help me. In America, every night children sleep on the streets. A growing number of people on the streets are children and young adults. And how do we treat these kids? Do we embrace them? Do we build them shelters, feed and take care of them? You guys gotta go. But, we just want food. Okay, you're still bothering the customers. Can you help us? No. We look at these kids as if homelessness is a disease as if it's something that could be caught. When I was washing my hair in a Denny's bathroom sink, and my head was, uh, too tall to fit from the faucet down to the bottom of the sink so I was in it sideways, trying to wash my hair. And when I flipped my hair up I got water, kind of, all over the mirror, and I looked in the mirror and I saw the women behind me that couldn't wash their hands because I was washing my hair and the look on their face was, they were so disgusted by me. Or we ignore them, and pretend they don't exist. This myth that there are kids who don't have anything to eat is a total lie. And... It is absolutely not a lie, and there actually are students, Oh, it is absolutely a total lie on a mass level! It all started after, like, I lost my grandmother, and then I lost my grandfather, and then while we were at, like, getting ready for my grandfather's funeral I got a call that my best friend back home passed away. Yeah, that sucked. So that was pretty devastating for him. And he had lived with his grandparents too, so to lose someone that he lived with for so long... I can't believe that we allow two million of our children to be on the street. That's how little we actually care about what's happening with youth in America. And unfortunately for them, nothing's changing. There are kids in New York City who go all weekend without having anything to eat except Oh, that is the biggest bologna I have... You, you... How many of you in the last few weeks have gone to bed hungry? Most of you've never met with these youths, or if you've met them you didn't know they were homeless. If you've met them and knew them you know they don't want to be, you know they want out. You'd know that they want to come back being part of society. And I'd tell you this one thing: we're a lesser society if we don't bring them back, we're a better society if we do. My name is Rotimi Rainwater, and when I was nineteen I was homeless. I was in the Navy and my mother got cancer and by the time I got out, she had lost her place. It took a while, but I got off the streets and now I am a director. In 2010, I made a film called Sugar about homeless youth. I went all over the country screening the film for homeless youth organizations and everywhere I went, kids came up asking me for help and I didn't know why. Like many, I had assumed this was an issue our government was dealing with. - In this country, teenagers. - And if that isn't shocking But the more I look, I realize it's not. I eventually got the chance to screen Sugar for Congress, but not one member of Congress showed up. And sitting there I began to wonder, is this an issue they don't care about? Would they just rather sweep it under the rug and pretend it doesn't exist? So I decided to do the only thing I could, which is make a film. Because I wanted to find out why in America there are so many of our children sleeping on our streets. As I hit the road I've decided to try to find out how many kids are homeless. According to Google, the numbers are between 48,000 and 2.8 million, which is ridiculous. So we've headed to Washington D.C. to figure out if anyone knows how many kids are on the streets. How many homeless youth do you think there are in America? Five thousand. Five thousand. The number was like 40,000 homeless like two years ago, something like that. I feel having a thousand is a bit much, is it? I could honestly have no clue about that. There's so many that I just don't know the number now. Who knows for sure? You never do. We, we, gen-We genuinely don't know the exact numbers. Gotta be in the hundreds of thousands of kids. There's over a million nationwide. There are estimates, um, that could be undercounts of 1.9 million. HUD published a report that said it was 40,000. So we know that we don't do a good job of counting youth. Is it forty thousand or is it two million? That's not a good place to be if you can't, if you don't know which. The reason that we don't know how many kids are on the street is that it cost a lot of money to do that kind of research. In the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, that has yet to pass in congress, there is funding that would be associated with doing an annual study to really get our arms around how many kids are we really talking about? Wait a minute, so there's never been a national study on homeless youth? That's correct. How can that be? Our government has funded some of the most ridiculous studies. From three million dollars to study the video game World of Warcraft's effect on helping companies compete more effectively in the global marketplace, to hundreds of thousands of dollars to study why chimpanzees throw poop; literally, throw poop. But our government can't tell us, with any certainty, how many of our children are sleeping on the streets at any time. Why has there never been a study done? It's not important to them, I don't think. They've not done it because there hasn't been any money for it. They don't want to put any money towards it. And so if they say there's a homeless youth issue, then they have to figure out how to address it. Why is there such a lack of compassion for these kids? In America, there are over 5,000 shelters for animals, but yet there's less than 400 for kids. The answer is simple, there is a stigma that surrounds you when you're on the streets. You're not seen as a child anymore, you're seen as homeless, dirty, unwanted. No one wakes up one day and says, "Hi, today I want to be homeless". Why do you think, um, kids are homeless? Um, because they want to, sometimes. I can promise you, 95% of those children do not want to be on the streets. There's a strong misconception that young people leave home just to do drugs. Most of them, because most of them out there are like drug addicts. Maybe it's alcohol use? And they'll tell you that, you know, if that young person needed help there was, there would be plenty of places they could go. And it's true, right? It's absolutely not true. So there it is, we don't know how many of our kids are on the streets, and we really don't even know why. I think it's time for me to head out and meet some of these kids myself. If it wasn't for him, there's no way I could be on the streets out here. I'm young and small and a lot of people out here, you know, go after young people. So there, there's no way I could be on this, on the streets, at least in this city, by myself. I would probably, like, be dead if, if I was. So I don't really have any fear that he would leave me and he proposed to me and I, you know, I... What was that like? It was beautiful, it was magical. I mean, um, it was towards the beginning of when we got to the city, so the city was so beautiful to me, like, already cause I was just seeing everything for the first time. And we were down by, uh, down on Mission a little ways, towards the park where the waterfall is, and it was night time, and it was beautiful, and there was music playing and... It was out of the blue, out of nowhere. I didn't expect it. It was right before we were about to go to sleep. And he got down on one knee and he proposed to me. He was like, "Babe I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and I don't want anyone but you. You have done so much for me and I want to spend the rest of my life with you." Come on in, man! Yes. Herro. Safe. So you say that's your girlfriend? Well, my fiancé. I gotta get used to it, yeah, I gotta get used to it. Tell me about that. Uh, it was just kinda, it was really corny, actually. It wasn't anything, like, extravagant, like... I explained it as magical and you explain it a corny. Well, I was, we were, like, getting ready for bed, I had just finished setting up the tent and stuff. And like, I had like no shirt on, I had shorts on, no shoes, no socks, you know what I mean? And like, I just felt like it was the right time. So like, I got down on one knee and I asked her to marry me. And she said yes and we hugged. And I don't know, I thought it was, like, really corny and, like, I want to re-do it at some point; like when we get our stuff together, like when we get our shit together. You know what I mean? But like, I don't know, it meant a lot to us. I thought it was the cutest thing, the most amazing thing. I'll never forget it. I want to remember that time forever. I proposed to her with like a, like a twenty five cent gum ball machine ring. Like super ghetto. Yeah. They turn her finger green though. So, we gotta get her a real ring. Definitely gotta get her a real ring. She's just, she's helped me through so much. She's always been there to pick me up when I'm down, to pick up the pieces when I'm broken. So, you know, like, I don't ever want to lose her, I want her to be there forever. Um, I don't, I don't use a tent or anything, that's, those are big and heavy and really inconvenient. Um, I just carry a tarp. And if it rains, I'll sleep underneath something like a gazebo. Or even, like a tree and just kinda like burrito myself in my tarp. So what'd you end up gettin"? Pork n' Beans. Yeah. Yeah. They kinda remind me of my grandmother. Oh, baked beans. They kinda remind my of my grandmother because she'd always make them, like really weird times, like Christmas. She'd, like, make a whole pan of baked beans. So even though it's a cold can of baked beans it kinda feels warm. It's really sweet. It tastes like beans and corn syrup, but I like it. They're not terrible. Would you like some? I appreciate that, but no. I didn't think so. So why did you choose this spot? I chose it because if I'm finding a place to sleep and I don't see someplace that I can be completely hidden by people, then I'd rather be somewhere where I'm exposed and underneath a light because if someone can see me, I know I can see them. And the light brings more of an- the street light brings more of an aspect of safety to me, somehow. Wow, that's interesting because I would have thought that it's hard to sleep underneath a big street light, like this. That's why I have this bandana. I put it over my eyes. So tell me, like, you know, how did you end up on the street? Why did you end up on the street? Do you want me to go all the way from the beginning? Yeah. Alright. Like all the way? You want raw? My father used to molest my sister and I. And he was a very lonely man. He was a very hurt and lonely man, for whatever reasons. He was an alcoholic, and at the age, I believe I was four or five, at the age of four or five one day he was molesting me on the couch. And at that very moment, I had came. Don't know if you know if it's possible or not, but at the age of four, that- that happens, it's possible. And I remember looking at him and, like, my heart was fluttering, and I remember looking at him going like, "whoa, Dad. What was that?". I was like, "what was that?". And I seen in his eyes, like he knew what happened, and he picked me up and he ran to the back bedroom, into my room, and put me on the bed, took my pants off, and put a pillow over my face and raped me. And all I could smell was the smell of latex and shit. All I could smell. And almost died. I remember... I remember telling myself if you live, if you choose to live, you can be whatever you want, if you just decide to live and grow up. I remember looking at him just like, just so angry. I was the most angry I've ever felt in my entire life, and I remember saying, "I don't want to be your girlfriend anymore." If that had never happened with your father, you think you would have ended up on the street? Nope. Definitely not. I don't see why I would be on the street if I hadn't... I would love to have had a relationship with my dad. I'd love to be a daddy's girl, and for that never to have happened. But it did happen, so this is how I ended up. And I feel like I'm making the best out of it, you know? It's pretty difficult sometimes, I mean, coming from, you know, living in an apartment and having a job and everything like that, you know? And just, you know, sitting on the street holding up a sign asking people for money just so we can eat and have clothes on our back is definitely pretty embarrassing. Everything was going great. We had roommates, they had jobs, we had jobs, and we were making ends meet. And then one day we were going out on a date, and his transmission went out in his car. And then the very next day he got in his first wreck ever, at work, and they fired him on the spot. And then, probably about three to four days later, our roommates both lost their jobs. We've only been on the streets a few weeks. It's probably the hardest few weeks my entire life. I mean, so much stuff has happened; it's scary, it can be really scary. Especially, you know, once the sun goes down; it's a completely different game. I mean, you've got people out here wanting to rob you, wanting to hurt you, taking advantage of every little thing. People that, you know, try to mess with her. It's just, it's not safe at all. It's pretty dangerous. It's a completely different atmosphere at night. I mean, the drunks come out to play, along with all the other drug users and things like that. Coming into this, you know, never being homeless before, not being around it, that kind of stuff it's just, people don't understand how difficult it is to be on the streets. I mean, you've got people offering you drugs all the time, I mean, they'll get upset if you don't want to buy drugs from them or take free drugs. There's people that try to proposition you for sex. Or, you know, look at stealing, for instance, her for maybe sex trade or whatever. I mean, there's uh, there was an instance: somebody was trying to give us a ride, and we didn't have hardly any money at all, and um, you know, I called him up, I found him on craigslist and he asked if, you know, if we didn't have enough money, if, uh, my lady would, you know, mind doing things for him. And I was just like, "No", you know, "we're not interested in that at all." and he got upset, and I just, I had to hang up the phone because we're not interested in doing anything like that. I worry about it more than anything. I mean, she's all I have, she's my everything. I don't know what I would do if something happened to her. I don't know what I would do if I couldn't be there to protect her. I try everything in my power to keep her safe. I do everything I can, and it's just really hard. I don't know if I could live with myself if anything happened. It's dangerous out here, it really is. I love you. I love you. More than anything. It's gonna be okay. I know. And we just, we want our lives back, you know? We really can't say anything more than that. Yeah. This is no way to live. No way to live. For anyone. Yeah. This is what these kids are really going through. I can't believe that this is acceptable in my country. How did this happen? And how in God's name did all this start? Most people don't realize that homelessness in America is a relatively new phenomenon. In the 1940's, 50's and 60's, homelessness was practically unheard of, but it all started to change in the early 80's, when there was a big push to save money on social service programs. In fact, the Government decided to cut the budget for public housing in section eight from 32 billion to just 7.5 billion dollars, and close most mental institutions. And where do you think all those people ended up? But according to our president, that wasn't the case. One problem, uh, that we've had, even in the best of times, and that is the people who are sleeping on the grates. The homeless who are homeless, you might say, by choice. - Yep, you heard him. - Ronald Regan said people were sleeping on the grates by choice. But it was the early 80's, and the "me mentality" was pervasive everywhere. Everyone was out for themselves and unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of our neediest citizens didn't fit into the new vision of what America could be like. So along with the Yuppies, there was another thing the 80's gave us, Homelessness. Ladies and gentlemen, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. It feels like, before we go any further, we should find out what our government is doing about this. So we're headed to talk to the United State's Inter-Agency Council on Homelessness to see Alright, what's the plan that you set forth, or are the goals that you have? Like, when are we supposed to, when is your goal to be able to end youth homelessness? So, uh, in opening doors, the federal plan we, it's, there's a ten-year timeline, so the plan was released in 2010, and we're- our goal is to end homelessness among youth by 2020. But wait, it's more than halfway to 2020, and nothing is getting better. In fact, last year in Los Angeles alone, the amount of homeless youth increased by 61%. The folks down on Capitol Hill don't really, uh, know what they're doing. You have people sitting in this, um, etherial chamber, uh, on Capitol Hill, making decisions over resources that are beyond human comprehension. And they act like they know what they're doing, and they don't. With all the confusion in the Government, it seems like we might have found one politician who's truly trying to do something to help these youth. His name is Senator Patrick Leahy, and he has a bill going through the Senate to try to fund the first national study on Youth homelessness. I don't think anybody knows how big an issue it is. In fact, we're trying to get some money to do a real study so we can show exactly how big it is. Do you see there being a lot of movement, a lot of change happening? Or what can we do to create change? Well, Senator Collins, a Republican from Maine, and I have tried to work in a bi-partisan way to get money to, uh, re-authorize the, uh, homeless act to get enough money so we can start approaching it. So what exactly is the bill? The bill is called the Leahy-Collins Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act, and this is what it does: it gives $165 million dollars to re-authorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, to help house, clothe and feed homeless youth in America. And it also adds 2 million dollars to create a national study on youth homelessness in America. So $165 million dollars sounds like a lot of money, but in the scheme of things, is it really? In the 2016 Federal Budget, 49.3 billion dollars was allocated to the Bureau of Housing and Urban Development, better known as HUD. And the budget for the foster care system was 7.6 billion. Unfortunately, none of their money goes to homeless youth; that's covered under the RHYA, who's total budget this year was only $116 million. Now, if we compromise and say there's only one million youth on the streets, that's $116 dollars per kid, per year; or 32 cents a day to house, clothe, and feed every single youth on the streets of America. When they are faceless, nameless, anonymous, it is easier to ignore. If we are following the kind of moral principles that people like to use in campaign speeches, they'll realize they're not faceless, nameless. We have to stand up and help them. These kids are not faceless or nameless, they're victims. They're vulnerable youth who survive issues that most of us could never imagine. So instead of asking ourselves if we can help these youths, we should be asking ourselves, how can we help them? And where do we start? Don't judge, don't think these kids are bad. Fill in your definition of bad, don't think that they're bad, they were in circumstances. If you heard their stories, if you saw what they went through, you would never be the same. So issues that I think you should pay attention to as you go down this journey include: the failure of the child welfare system; paying attention to why are these young people aging out with no resources? The issue of sex trafficking of minors; big issue in this country. We think of it as an international issue; it's goin' on right in our communities. Youths that come out; so lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youths who come out to their parents, you know, get kicked out, can't live there, or it's such a hostile environment that they leave. I think that... see, we have to understand that these aren't just random kids, these are our kids. And we have to help them, because who's going to help them if we don't? We owe it to them, we have to help these kids, they don't have anyone. They're our kids. Next thing I know, the police are there, the social worker's there, she's saying put all your clothes in trash bags, you guys are being removed from the home. And then I remember getting to the house, you know, back to and getting in the bed and crying. I really wanted to-I really wanted to be dead and cause I really felt like what's my purpose here on this planet? And there's no reason for me I'm just getting, like, all this abuse. I'm just- am I just here to get hurt? A child enters foster care every two minutes in the United States. Many foster youth when aging out are given 30 minutes and a trash bag to pack their belongings and leave. 40% of those children will end up homeless. Our foster care system needs a lot of work. It's really scary, it's really scary how these kids, who have no one at 17, are kicked out of the system, onto the street and basically with no skills, no support and they wind up repeating the cycle of what got them there in the first place. Nobody wants to be running around all alone, and nobody wants to be hurting other people, or be hurt. It's just something that ends up, you metamorphosis into it because man, if I go behind that door, that front door of that house, I don't know what's going on in that household. I could get hurt in there. It's probably more dangerous behind that door that locks than it is out here in these streets that are open. The general consensus in America, I don't know if it's right or wrong, but I want to ask you about it, is that in a lot of ways the foster care system is broken, is failing. Do you agree with that? Is that the case? Well, the foster care system is getting better, but as long as the funding is based on taking kids out of the household, as opposed to preventing a problem, then I would say the system is broken; I would agree with that. So while we're in DC, I decided to see a friend of mine, Lexie. Like many foster kids, Lexie came from a home that was dysfunctional and couldn't care for her anymore. She's still in the foster care system, but through a program, has been able to get a summer internship with a member of Congress. She's staying at a friend's apartment and has agreed to tell me her story. Because as she puts it, she survived the foster care system. I remember walking down the hallway, and outside was a car. My sister was in the car and they opened the truck to put my bag in, put my backpack in and there's a luggage. My sister is sitting in the backseat just looking at me and she, there's like a hanger on the window with clothes on it. So then I get in the back seat, and then the driver gets in and we start driving away. And then I ask her, I'm like, "what is going on?" she said, "you don't know?", and I said "No!", and she was like "You are in foster care now, you're not going home." So where did you go from there? So then we went to my uncle Chris's house, which is awesome. He lives on a huge farm and me and my sister got to stay there. And it was a time where I could start to heal. Um, but unfortunately there weren't enough bedrooms in his home. And so DCF told us that eventually, we would have to leave. And so my uncle tried so much to let us stay, uh, but one day DCF just came and picked me up. And I remember him. We were having dinner that night, and we knew they were coming after dinner and, um, trying to pretend like it was no big elephant in the room, like it was a happy dinner. And then he gave me a bible, so then I left to go to the shelter. They picked me up. That sounds so terrible. Um. Very scared. I had almost nothing with me. Um, and I didn't know where I was going, and seeing my uncle be left behind and how scared he was for me. I just had to put on a strong face, like I am going to get through this. So then they bring me to the shelter, and I'll never forget it because the-I'm a very small now, I'm 21, so back then I was even smaller. Um, and I was like struggling to carry, like, my trash bags up the stairs, and, like, no one even offered to help. It just, it all happened so quickly because it ended up in a month I went from having a family to being alone in a shelter. Um. And I, I did not know what I was going to do. My name is Ayana Lapierce, everybody calls me Kiki. So what was it like when you went to foster care for the first time? My first foster home experience was terrifying. I didn't know what was going on; I was told I was going to a good home, it was a lie. I was locked in a closet, burned with hair straightener every day in the Colorado Springs foster home. The closet was dark, scary, they usually locked it at night; one night they forgot. So tell me about the foster care where you were first exposed to being trafficked. Foster parent would come in, get one of us, we didn't ever know what was going on; we'd be led to a room and we would be used. We got told to go change and to be in the other room or else. And they would have their way with us. And if we didn't allow them to, we didn't get fed or we didn't get, you know, get something we need. And how old were you when this happened to you? Thirteen. It didn't seem like it was an unregular thing, because we still had time to play, go to school and stuff. It was just like, whenever they needed money, that's what we were there for. And which bedroom would they force you guys to do that in? There's a bedroom in the back, back; you can't see it. There's three bedrooms in here. There's one here, there's one in the middle of that one, and then there's the very back. Me and my foster sister shared this one right here. The very back was the guest room. It had a large, queen size bed. Always smelled nice; smelled like spearmint sometimes. This is the hotel we would come to when she would set up dates for me. Um, we'd go straight to the back. You make a left. And it's that room right there with the... I don't know if that's 139; it's 139. A lot of people still think it's something that doesn't happen in preponderance in the USA and it is in Thailand, it is in Africa, it is in Indonesia, Nepal. Um, but when you look back through history and you have 10-16 year old girls in jail for prostitution in the last three decades, and you have high numbers of them in juvenile hall for prostitution at 12 years old, what does that tell you? 325,000 children are at risk of becoming victims of sex trafficking in the United States. The average age of a child forced into sex trafficking is 12 years old. 1 in 3 homeless youth will be lured into sex trafficking within 48 hours of leaving their home. Homeless young women are totally susceptible to human trafficking; they're our most vulnerable. They're out on the streets, no place to go. They're afraid, they're looking for some sense of security. They're looking for someone to make them feel good, to feel better about their situation. And the first person that comes along who offers them, a way out is something that usually they're gonna say yes to; just out of sheer necessity. There's no greater prison than the one that is mental, psychological, emotional. And it's taken me my whole life to be free. But there are so many people who are not. And I'm not out until they're out. This is a life's work, this is a clarion call. For the first part of my marriage, you know, I'll be honest, I was, I was afraid, you know. I was a... I was afraid for my husband to touch me, even though I loved him and because I... because I really wanted him, but I didn't understand that it was okay, you know? And I didn't know how to, to tell him it's not you, it's... but how do I, you know, get past it? You know? And I got really scarred up inside, and I can't have my own children, and I wanted children so bad. My dad had diabetes, um, and ended up losing both of his legs, uh, when I was seven. Um, I ended up taking care of him because he couldn't really do a lot for himself. Um, so cooking, cleaning, bathing him, um, giving him his insulin, uh, changing his dialysis bags; and I did that until he passed away. Once my father died, um, DCF came to my house and tried to remove me. They said that I needed to be in a safe place, I needed to go to a group home or a residential program to take care of me because I had no one to take care of me. I went into my room, I grabbed a bag, I put some clothes in it, a couple pictures. I walked outside and called the friend that I befriended on Myspace. When did you first meet their, what's the name? Is it gonna be recorded? Yeah, is that okay? I've never told anybody her name. Well on her Myspace profile it said that she was 18, and um, that she was new to Tamp-The Tampa Bay area, and, um, that she, like, lived with her mom and things like that. We talked for 3 days messaging back and forth, and then I gave her my phone number. Um, she asked me if I had a lot of friends, I told her no. Um, she asked me what grade I was in, at the time I was in eighth grade. And that was basically it. Like, "what kind of music do you like?", "what kind of food do you eat?", "don't you hate when this happens?"; like those kinda conversations. So you thought you had, like, another girlfriend, like you-? Yeah, and I never had a friend, really. I never hung out with any girls, I always hung out with boys. When I ran away I asked her if she would come get me because I didn't want to be placed in foster care. Once she came got me, and I got in the car my life completely changed. Um, that night I just remember being passed around, and just kind of different faces and, um, just like a whole bunch of sweat. And I remember after everybody being done with me, them carrying me back to her house and putting me in her bed. And then she walked me to the bathroom and she told me to get in the shower. She stood there while I was getting in the shower and she told me that I'm hers. She just said that I belong to her. And I was like, "But you let those men rape me." and she was like, "They didn't rape you, you let them have sex with you." So when you left here, why did they take you to Jersey, what happened? Um, when we were going back out to Hillsborough County a lot of people started to question who I was. Um, a lot of people said "who is this white girl?", "Why do you-Where did she come from? Why is she with you? She's not your sister, she's not your cousin, she doesn't look like anybody you've ever brought around before." um, so my trafficker said that we were going to go to Atlantic City, Jersey and we were going to live there. The house that they kept me in was like an apartment home. It had a basement and probably, I don't know, 8 or 10 people lived there. In the basement, there were 4 or 5 girls who were with me. I don't, we weren't really allowed to talk to each other. So I don't know their ages; I know that they were as young as I was or younger. And how did they keep you down there? You said you were chained together or something like that? We had just a... I don't know what kind of chain it was. It wasn't, like, a big chain, but it was a thin chain; and you could also hear it if we moved. So it was just wrapped around our little cuff thing that we had on. And we were all together in the line. But it was extra chain in between so we weren't tight. When they would bring clients down to have sex with us, um, we weren't moved into a different room. We would all just have to lay there and watch them. We didn't watch really, we just laid there. And they would have sex with whoever they paid for. After, like, going through, like, everything with telling the people that this is what happened and them not doing anything, and them kind of taking her side of-I felt like they kind of believed that a woman couldn't do this to somebody. Like, at that time, like, oh this couldn't happen or-I just feel like, I don't know. I feel like the system failed. And she's probably doing what she did to me to other girls right now. As we head back on the road, we just found out that the bill has passed the first round of the Senate Judiciary Committee. There is some pushback on the language that protects LGBT youth, but this is the first step towards getting this bill passed. And that's why Senator Collins and I included a non-discrimination provision in our amendment. Though make clear that any program accepting federal dollars must help care for all these children. They can't turn these young people away because they do not like the way they look, or dress, or who they love. No program that takes federal money should be allowed to discriminate, period. Even with all the recent gains made by gays bisexuals, and transgenders, hundreds of thousands aren't feeling those gains. That's because many are more concerned with survival. According to a study out of UCLA, up to 40% of homeless youth are LGBT, uh, are often rejected by family. According to the Center for American Progress, at least 320,000 LGBT youths are homeless in this country. It was me, my mom, my dad, the pastor, and another person; and she explained to me the reason why I am gay is because I opened myself up to demons and devils. These demons and devils literally sought me out and done things to me while I'm sleeping and that turned me gay. They have this idea in church, especially the pentecostal church, that if you're gay, it has something to do with a demon. And she was saying if you continue to live this lifestyle of homosexuality, you will not only possibly get a disease, but you will end up burning in hell forever and ever and ever and ever and ever. How big was the church for you in your life? Wow! This church right here was the biggest thing ever. I'd come here every Sunday. In the past, they'd have churches in the morning and at night. They'd have Bible Studies on Tuesday's. Wednesday is, um, choir rehearsal. Thursday is prayer. And Saturday we had morning prayer. So Church is like everyday breathing, living. Church all the time. So this was your life? This was my life. It was my only-I had no life outside of church and school. So I went to my church to get help. I contacted my elder. He said he knows certain things happen in your life and people's life to where God is going to shake you. You're homeless, and you're going through what you're going through because you turned away from God, you pretty much turned your back on your family and your church, so God's making you homeless so you'll come back to him. When I finally ended up on the street, I had to sleep behind a dumpster. I never thought that would ever happen to me. I was really mortified. I was flabbergasted that I literally am behind this dumpster and I have to sleep where there's bugs, there's, you know, condoms everywhere. You know, there's, you know there's gunshots and there's people making all these sounds and noises because they're hookin'. I started to think, you know, I'm going through this because I am gay and this is God's form of punishment for me, his creation, to be homeless. I went to my father's house telling him I am homeless, I want, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be on the street. He didn't care because I'm gay. He didn't want me to live with him. This is the home I grew up in; my family: me, my mom, and my two brothers. If I had one wish, I'd wish that me and my brothers, and my mom and dad could all be a family, and they all could accept me for who I am. Are you okay? Yeah. As we head home we decided to stop back in Denver and visit the Comitis Family Shelter, where we met Kiki because I'd heard a group of children were staying there now. And this is where I met Daveviana. She's living in the shelter with her mother and sister after they lost their home. And like many other families, they're just trying to spend another night off the streets. And you have to do that every night when you're going to bed? Well, if they had the stair steps or something like that, I get on there, but I usually get on this way. I used to sleep on that one, but I let one of the adults that I talk to sleep there because she's pregnant, and I'm nice... most of the time. If you wanna get into Comitis, you have to be here by 6 because that's the time that we're allowed to be on the property. But usually, if it's over 40 people we have to do lottery, and only 40 people are allowed to get in. Well if we volunteered, it's basically we just have to put our names on this piece of paper, and if we get choosed, then Keith will give us one of the jobs to do. Yes, if we do chores we can stay, without doing the lottery. Oh, hey Dave. Hey David. Do you need help? Mhm! It's not that fun doing it by yourself, but doing it with a friend gives you some entertainment. We just have fun, talk about just random stuff, crazy stuff. Like, Daveviana talks about Justin Bieber a lot. Yeah, David, tell him. And I get under her skin by, like, calling him names and stuff like that, but... Basically when I was younger, when I was like 11, my sister, she liked Justin Beiber and she had a whole bunch of pictures of him. So I took 'em, and I put this in this, I put them in this scrapbook. This is a picture of when he, uh, sprained his leg when he had a concert. And this is some of his songs I know, like, Common Denominator, and this one's One Time. What's it say right there? This one? Uh huh. Forever a fan Aw My favorite Justin Beiber song was Nothing Like Us, but it was also Fall because it was about Selena Gomez. How does that go? You want me to sing it to you? Yeah. Okay. Just don't stare at me. I won't. I won't even look. Okay, um... Here at Comitis, we actually, everybody knows each other here, and you can make friends here because there are some kids that are my age, and some kids that are my sister's age. I would say, even though we're homeless, every kid has a dream, and some dreams come true, but some don't. But you have to try in order to get your dreams to come true. - He got me! - Woo woo woo woo woo woo. Oh shit! I'm the champ, I'm the champ! His hands hurt. There are between 48,000 and 2.8 million youth on the streets. 5,000 youth die on the streets of America every year. That's 13 youth who die on the streets every day. Being homeless is like being turned into an animal. You're reduced to surviving. You're reduced to every single day worrying about food, shelter, water, and safety. You're also in so much pain that you start using if you weren't already using. And so because they weren't given a good emotional skill set, often they'll just turn to numbing it out because the stress and the pain is so overwhelming that why people choose to numb out is very understandable. But once you choose to start numbing out, it's very hard to climb out of the situation that you're in. Honestly, I don't know what's going on. All I know is I got a call from his mom this morning saying she hasn't talked to him in six months. When's the last time you talked to him? Uh, four months ago. What did he say? He was yelling. He was crying, and then he hung up the phone on me. And then his mom calls me this morning, crying, talking about, "I know something's happened to him", "I'm afraid he's dead on the side of the streets", "Can you drive up to San Francisco and find him?" Hi Kat, how are you, it's Rotimi? Hi Rotimi, how are you? I'm hanging in there, I'm hanging in there. Um, so we're here in San Francisco, and um... Oh, thank you very much. So, no news from Conner and Makayla? No. Nothing. Since the last time we saw Conner and Makayla they've gone missing. Nobody from their family has heard from them in 4 months. They've been posting all over social media, trying to find them and finally, they've gotten in contact with us and asked if we could help. This is really concerning, because the last time I spoke with Conner and Makayla they had just found a room to rent, had gotten clean, and even had a dog named Bart. They were so hopeful, so something horrible must have happened to them to end up back on the streets. We need to find them. So we're down in the Tenderloin District, showing pictures and asking everyone if they've seen Conner and Makayla. Today we're going to try to find them. Excuse me, I'm so sorry to bother you. I'm looking for these two kids. Have you seen these kids, Conner and Makayla? Uh, any ideas where they hang out or...? Well, they, they maybe near the Bart Station? Have you been down there? No, where is that? Uh, that's at Pacific student center. Um. Oh so the place where they hang out is named Market Dell at the... Excuse me, I'm trying to see- Have you seen these two kids? They, they're supposed to be around here, and I'm just trying to find them. I know Makayla and, um, Conner. Really? I've been doing a documentary for the past year about homeless youth, and I've been working with them since last year. You know where Powell is? Where's Powell? Powell is right up there. You know where the Bart station is? Uh huh. They be over there panhandling. Bart is right down there. Thank God they're here. Hey, hey, hey! What's up, Big Guy! How are you? Oh my god! I lost track of you guys. I was so worried. Hey! How are you? How are you guys doing? Doing good how are you? Well I was up here shooting, and we hadn't heard, seen, heard from you in so long, so I just- I was gonna say, it's so good to see you. So what's been, uh, are you guys okay? Just being honest with you, you know, like, a lot of people reached out to us worried about you guys. Yeah. Really? I didn't know. I didn't know, I- I mean they, yeah, cause like, like, your, your mom reached out to me, um, like, I mean a bunch of people have reached out and they were like worried sick and, you know, like, crying, and just like worried. Like, they, they just don't, they just don't care. Like, everybody is scared to death right now. I don't know if it's to your house or to your dad's house, but like, they just want you guys to go home. Yeah. Yeah, when we go home we have no place to go. Yeah. You know, I don't know. They're weird. You're definitely allowed to sit down when we're not on Powell street Everybody in the world can see us. You know? Cause I'm gonna cry. It's a fact, so... So, um, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Okay. Um, we found them. Are they alright? Yeah. Um, they, uh, looked healthy. Um, uh, they look worse or wear, you know, honestly. But I wanted to ask you, um, you know I told them that everybody just wants them to come home. And, um, I don't want to offer something- like I don't want to say look your mom will get a bus and bring you back. Like, you know, like seeing all the posts that you had put up and what everyone else is saying, you know, like, you know I told them, I was like look if, if you want we'll buy you guys bus tickets to get you back to Mass. Like, whatever it takes, we wanna help, you know? Um. What would you like me to tell him? He needs to get help. Alright, Kat. Well, you know. We'll do our best. That's all we can do. I will. I'll tell them you love 'em. I will. Okay. Of course. Bye-bye. I misread their post. As long as they're using, nobody will, uh, will let them in. You see all these posts: "just tell them to come home", "just tell them to come home", "just tell them to come home". So ok, we tell them to come home, and they go well no, no, no, no. Okay, they're safe, that's great, but don't come home until you, you're clean. How the hell are they going to get clean? And how are they even open to the fact of getting clean when nobody is just saying, look I love you, just come home. We're going to have to work on your issues, we're gonna have to work on things, but the first thing is, just come home. That's what parents don't get sometimes. Sometimes you just need to show them unconditional love and then they can change. But until then they're stuck on the streets. Well in December, we went to the hospital and found out that I was six months pregnant. And, um, that I was actually in labor. And, uh, that it was happening really quickly, and that, uh, there was a chance that they could prevent the labor and my water breaking. And that junior could actually continue to be in, stay inside of me. They told me that she'd be fine for the night and that nothing would happen. They ended up changing their mind, not letting me use a bucket to go to the bathroom. They were like well I don't want you, I don't want you to keep using this. I'm gonna use a catheter. And I was like, I can't use those. They, my body rejects them. It's not going to be good. Like... As soon as they pumped the bubble to keep it in, it broke her water. They said well since you're having him now, there's a chance that, there's a greater chance that he might not live, that he won't be developed enough to live. But when he came out he was perfectly healthy. They told us that if they kept him on a ventilator that he could have lived. And, uh, it was against the doctor's morals to keep him on the venti- the breathing machine. So she unplugged him. And I told her that it wasn't okay and that I wanted him to stay on it. And she said, "I'm taking him off at midnight." They said that he could stay in my arms until his heart stopped. And, uh, his heart stopped in his arms when he got back. I'm so sorry. When he was on the machine, he was kicking and everything. There's no reason that he shouldn't have lived. For anyone else's kid, they could keep them for months, until they were able to breathe on their own. But they wouldn't for mine. They wouldn't even keep him on long enough for him to see him move. And I think she just wouldn't do it because, I mean, we're street kids. You know, we're homeless. We're homeless. They were probably like, well they're homeless. Even if this kid lives, they're not going to have, like, a life or a good support system or something. But, you know, if, if they kept him on that machine, he would have been in the hospital for a couple of months. So that would have given us plenty of time to fix our situation. We didn't know that he was going to come out right then. We didn't know that that was going to happen. And it wasn't supposed to, he shouldn't have. There's not words to describe it. It sucks. As a filmmaker, you're not supposed to get close to the people you're filming. You're not supposed to be affected by this. But how can you not be affected watching a young mother grieve for her child? Or a mother grieving for her son she can't help? I hate seeing this happen to Conner and Makayla, but this is the danger that comes when children stay on the street too long. And if this can happen to Conner and Makayla, imagine what can happen to Calub, or David, or Daveviana. It was never my intention to tell my story, but being with these kids and asking them to be brave enough to be open with their own stories, I'd be a hypocrite not to tell my story. It's time to go home. When you're making a movie, and when you're planning on this trip like you just, you separate yourself. But like, flying over Orlando, and hearing, you know, we're 60 miles away, and we're on our final descent. It hit home, you know? I've been back to Orlando since my mother passed, but I've never come to Lake Underhill. I never come to East-West, like I just find ways to get around it. Like, I never came back to face this. I hadn't seen my mother probably in about two years and my mother got cancer. And even though I wasn't close with her, like, the first thing I could think about was, like I've just gotta get home. I've gotta take care of my mom. My grandmother told me, "she made her own bed; she's gonna lay in it. I told you not to get out of the military, so I'm not going to help you." I think that was the hardest thing I ever had to face. I asked what I was supposed to do, and she told me that she "heard the shelter downtown had good split pea soup on Wednesdays." My friend and I, when we were like 9 years old, used to come down here to go fishing. This wasn't here, so you could go down a little bit further. I guess we can talk right here if you want. The nights that I couldn't find a place to stay or somebody to be with, um, I would generally come hang out at the park, there's a lot of benches around here. Um, and then when it would rain, as it so often does in Orlando, I'd uh, I'd go right underneath there. It really puts things into perspective when... it put things into perspective when, um, you realize you're sleeping under an overpass. You know? It's um, it's not what you ever would expect. The first time I came here, um... The first time I came here I was really, really depressed. And... yeah, I didn't know. I didn't know what to do. You know, um... feeling that you have family out there or somebody who's supposed to love you. A grandmother, I mean they make songs about grandmothers. You know... Just to witness that is, um, it's painful, you know? So the first time I came here I wanted to kill myself. And I didn't know how to do it, and... Like, what made you change your mind? Yeah, I'm not going to talk about that. It's... I don't know, you know? I think most people have desperation, and they talk about suicide, and they feel that way, and you know, you sit underneath an overpass and you have tears streaming out of your eyes, and you just feel like I wish I could die. But, you know. What kind of asshole would I have been committing suicide when my mother is fighting for her life? I really wasn't prepared to take care of my mom when she got sick. Um, we didn't have that kind of relationship. My mother was an alcoholic, and a prescription pill addict. So, you know, when I was 9 years old I was taking care of my mom. I always say, like, I feel like I was a shit son, but you know, I'm the shit son of a shit parent. So, you know... If you can, uh, have that one last conversation with your mom before she passed, how do you think it would go? If I could have that conversation. That one last conversation with my mom? I don't think I would. Honestly, I don't know what would I say to my mom? I'd ask her if I could just lay next to her, and not say a word and just lay on her shoulder. And like, um... my mom used to rub my hair when I was a kid. If I could have one more night. One more time with my mom, that's what I'd... We wouldn't talk about anything. I'd just want to lay on her shoulder. It's been 25 years since my mother passed, and I finally realized that I'm still dealing with the effects of being abandoned and left on the streets. I was 22 when my mother died, and every time I think of her I still feel like that young kid. Vulnerable, alone and scared. The experience of this movie has made me realize that all homeless youth share one thing in common. We've all been abandoned, forgotten by the ones who are supposed to love us the most. Whether that's a mother, or a father, a foster care parent, or even our country. Every one of these kids who are on the streets needed someone, and that someone failed them. And unfortunately, we are still failing them. This is why it's so important to change how we treat these kids. And why it's so important for our government to do something. The question is on amendment number 290. Is there a sufficient second? There is. The clerk will call the role. - Mr. Alexander, Ms. - Ayotte, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Blunt... Senator Leahy, as we all know, has been a tireless advocate for homeless and runaway youth, and for the LGTB individuals, and for victims of human trafficking. And his bill would provide the necessary services and additional protections for all of these young children. So thank you again, Senator Leahy, for your continued work on behalf of some of our most vulnerable, our runaway and homeless youth. Is there anyone wishing to vote, or wishing change their vote? On this vote, the yay's are 56, and nay's are 43. Under the previous order, requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is not agreed to. And there it is, we finally see exactly why millions of kids sleep on the streets every year. Why children die every day because there are still members of our government who put politics before people. So getting it down to the bare bones, the reason that the Runaway Homeless Youth Trafficking Protection Act did not pass is because it had language in there that had... It said you cannot discriminate based on sex, race, whatever, and then there's four words: sexual orientation and sexual identity. And those four words prevented it from being passed. It's unconscionable that you could just turn your back for politics, for politic's sake, that you can let children stay on the street, that you can compromise the future of children who are part of our community. How do we, the richest, most powerful, wealthiest nation in the world allow hundreds of thousands of teenagers to be suffering in the streets without shelter? You know, how do we do that? Um, it feels like these youth are being used as political tools, you know? Well it's very interesting you say that because that's basically what I say. If we ask- If any of you get asked this question you're going to say "oh, we want to help homeless youth". Well help them, but help all of them. When did our youth become political pawns. When did it become okay to sacrifice the needs of our children for someone or some political group's agenda? Haven't we learned anything? Throughout history, people have hidden their agendas behind their religious beliefs; beliefs meant to inspire and unite, not to exclude and discriminate. When are we going to realize that there is a cost to this bigotry, this hatred? When will we learn right now that cost is our children? And while they sit in their comfortable offices, pushing these policies, there are children in the streets, right now, in pain. How do you raise someone and decide to abandon them? The most important unit, we'll say, in our entire church is the family unit. Families don't reject that's, that's, that's, there's never an excuse. And if you, if you believe in this savior, Jesus Christ, then you have to believe and know that he didn't reject. I recently got a call from Calub, who told me his father had cancer and wanted to see him. So we've agreed to drive him to his father's home so we can get a chance to spend some time with him and let his father tell his side of the story. Alright. Okay. Bye. She just wants to make it clear that they wanted to help me the entire time on the run, just I didn't let them. That's basically what she was just telling me. So... My family wants me to make them sound like they're perfect, and we are, we are nowhere near a perfect family. I mean, we all have our problems. You know, I'm in treatment. You know, my dad's got his own problems, my stepmom's got his own problems, everybody's got their own problems. So it's very difficult to even try to I guess lie and say that we're a perfect family. But what do you do? Do you just forgive them and move on or... I do my best to forgive him, I just kind of play along and whatever he says is what he says. I don't have much time with him anyway, so I'm just going to do whatever I can to make him happy. So this is the crew. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm painting Terry's room so I don't know what you guys are going to do, but, I mean. I don't know how this is supposed to go, or. He just wants to talk to me and you. Oh, really? Yeah. And this this is the Director. Really? I thought you knew this? No, you didn't, you didn't tell me, Kayla. So... You just said that this film crew is coming over and you were making a movie, so... Yeah, cause we wanted to talk to you. Alright damnit. Let me cover some things up. Okay. We'll go outside. Okay. I recently got a message from Calub's stepmother, who told me that Calub was back on the street. His father's cancer had gone into remission, and he had once again turned his back on Calub. What would happen if parents didn't reject their children after coming out as LGBT? Imagine what these youth could accomplish. I am your voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. What you would see if this budget were enacted would be an awful lot of empty metal desks in Washington D.C. and a lot of smaller programs. Let's take a look at how much smaller. EPA, uh, down 31%. And HUD, a 6 billion dollar cut there. What you hear from the Government, we hear from the White House, actually, is that they see a lot of duplicative programs, they would move money around, they'd get rid of waste, and things that shouldn't be done by certain agencies would be eliminated. Living in the wealthiest country in the world, it's easy to fall into this false sense of security; like things are only going to get better, and they can't get worse. But President Trump's actions have just shown that they can get worse. A lot worse. So how do we solve this issue when the Government seems content to deny it? Our government is the only entity with the money and the power to fix this problem nationally, but they are refusing to make this a priority. So while there are members of the House and the Senate who wanna help these youth, it's going to be an uphill battle; and one they can't fight alone. To solve this issue, the Government, corporations and private citizens need to come together to help these youth; but we need to do it now. Each year, more than 5,000 youth die on the streets of America. That's an average of 13 youth dying every day. That's like Columbine happening every single day of every single year. And nobody wants to talk about it. We should be embarrassed that 5,000 kids, homeless youth die in the streets every year. We should be embarrassed and ashamed that 13 kids die a day. - So what can we do about this? - The issue seems huge, and we get overwhelmed, but it doesn't have to be like that. You don't have to help the masses, you just have to help one. You just have to help the situation in your community. So you don't have to solve it for the thousands or the millions, you just have to just have to help be part of the solution for young people in your community. If you're looking for a way to help a homeless youth, just stop and say hi. Look for small, kind things you can do. It's amazing how radical it can be. If you see a kid on the street just stop, say hi, acknowledge them; they're a person just like you. I mean, anybody can make a peanut butter sandwich- or a wild butter sandwich, cause some people are allergic to peanuts, and give it out. We, we try to pick their dignity up, you know, and let them know that me and you are the same person, you just having a hard time right now. Everywhere I go, people ask me what they can do, and I tell them whatever you can. Everyday youth die on the streets and many of them from suicide. They've been rejected everywhere they've turned for help, so they feel like they no longer belong. So start by stopping and saying hi, remind them that they do matter; you might just save their lives. But beyond that, there are little things that you can do to help. Give them some socks, a jacket in the winter, or a sandwich. Of course, these are just bandaids; but while we struggle for solutions, these youth are dying and we need to help keep them alive. There are thousands of organizations across the country, who are working hard to help these youth because there are millions of youth who need your help. And right now there are so many people trying to help them. Well we've built 450 units of housing across the nation. Our foundation was the lead funder of the JBG Soul Homes. It's transitional housing; it's people who've aged out of foster care and, and for these young people who are transitioning it just makes it easier. John was involved with the arena football team, uh in Philadelphia, and he was staying at the Ritz Carlton in Center City; it was a really cold bitter cold winter night, he looked out the window, he saw someone sleeping on the street and he said this is unconscionable. How in the richest country of the world can we have people sleeping on our streets? We all, um, have a social responsibility to today's youth. We have to really, um, give them a hand up, not just a handout. It's kinda like teach someone to fish, not just give them a fish; that idea. They don't necessarily want to be livin' in the streets. And kids in foster care don't necessarily want to be livin' in foster care. Every single one of them want to be loved, and feel like they're a part of something, and they want, they want to grow. So as you know, we're finishing the film, and throughout the filming, we've been using 1 million is kind of like the accepted number that most people are saying are comfortable are on the streets. Is that accurate? No, that's way off. What do you mean that's way off, like, what have you found? We've found closer to 4 million young people experiencing some form of homelessness within a one year period. 4 million kids in America? 4 million young people in the United Staes, ages 13-25. So how did we get it wrong for so long? We never did a national study on youth homelessness. We never had a nationally representative survey in the way that we would for employment, or domestic violence, or HIV AIDS. We just haven't made that investment in understanding the full scope and scale of the challenge. Do you have enough information? Can we fix youth homelessness now? Or what, what needs to happen? Well, we don't have enough to just cure youth homelessness, now. We need to make a commitment to continued investment, and research, and development around youth homelessness. If you think of the other major social challenges, like HIV, we didn't just do one study, call it a day, and then work towards eradicating HIV. We had to continue, and we still continue to invest as a nation in research, not only on the scale of the problem, but on what works to fix it; a lot on prevention. Uh, and that's the kind of commitment that we need to bring to youth homelessness. And what about with the RHYA? Uh, we definitely need a greater investment in the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. That is the single piece of legislation that is committed to this population. With 4 million young people experiencing some form of homelessness in a year, and only $127 million dollars invested in, uh, or appropriated to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs and services, we're clearly not committing resources that match the full, uh, scale of the challenge. Yeah, that's just ridiculous. Yeah, it's nothing compared to what we need to end youth homelessness. So if the RHYA was getting $116 million for 1 million youth, and that equaled 32 cents a day to home, clothe and feed them, and now we know it's 4 million. That means that the wealthiest country in the world is giving 8 cents per day to feed, clothe and shelter their homeless youth. How can we value so many other things over our own children? When are we going to realize that enough is enough and that it's time to value these youth? When are we going to realize that they are our future? And if given half a chance there's so much they can do. A homeless 18 year-old proved if you have the drive you really can do anything. Rashema Melson graduated From Anacostia High School tonight as Valedictorian. Matthew was homeless. A teacher there realized the young musician was in a tough spot. He's been chosen to perform later this month at Carnegie Hall. Santos is now living on her own, attending UDC, and plans to be a doctor. As we were finishing the film, I got a call from Lexie, who we saw over a year ago. And now, not only does she have a job on Capitol Hill, she also got to address congress. I believe that the education of a foster youth is their only means to a better life. And that they too should be given the right to a stable safe classroom. So when I was in foster care, I had to choose between a stable family and a stable education, and I knew that there was just something so extremely wrong about that. Uh, and so when I came here I knew that's what I wanted to write about from day one. And so I started doing my research, utilizing the Library of Congress, utilizing the brilliant people here on The Hill for their, uh, expertise and ended up publishing a report called From Homeless to the House of Representatives: How a Stable Education Saved a Foster Child. And every single day I remind myself of how badly I wanted this for years. These success stories are not limited to the children in this movie or the occasional PR piece in the news, they happen around us all the time to those of all walks of life. In fact, many celebrities that we idolize today started their journey in a similar way and on similar streets. Halle Berry was forced to live in a homeless shelter in her twenties. Steve Jobs would walk 7 miles every Sunday to eat one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna Temple. Jewel, Steve Harvey, Tyler Perry, and even Harry Houdini all struggled with homelessness before finding the fame they're so remembered for now. We are all capable of so much more, and our dreams are what truly define us. My dream is to be a singer. I want to go to college. Go to college for business management and get my own construction company. That one day I could be a teacher. I see myself being a therapist or like a counselor of some sort. I want to be something different, like, something that's differen't from everybody else. I'd like to be able to start my own shop, and then build a family with Makayla. You know, cause I love her. So what have we learned? We've traveled all over the country and we've found out that youth homelessness is everywhere. And we've also learned that no matter how big the problem is, nobody really wants to talk about it because the solution is not an easy one. We can't solve a problem unless we've studied it. And while Chapin Hall has done an initial study, the Government has yet to truly address the issue. We have to take this seriously, but we need our government's help. Because these youth are incredible, and if given half a chance they can do amazing things, just like your children. And just like your children, they need your help. Because what do all these kids have in common? That they're homeless? That they've experienced pain? Some may say that, and that's what some might choose to see. But I see something else: I see hope, I see potential, I see beauty, I see the future. I see your children, your son, your daughter, I see my daughters. And that's the point. It's time not to see them as homeless kids. It's time to see them for what they are: our children. And it's time to do something to help them. Because if we've learned anything it's the fact that if we don't do something, it's not just going to go away. And statistically speaking, since you've sat down to watch this film, another child has died on the streets. For all the kids that are still on the street. This song is for you As long as there's a beating in my chest
