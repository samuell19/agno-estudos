(technological music) (grand opera music) (speaking foreign language) - The commander really exhausts me. - A soldier of Germany never admits it. - I'm not saying that I'm complaining, Cal. (opera music) - Get the hell out! Go ahead, get out! (opera music) (crickets chirping) (drums beating) (grand opera music) - 30 and 20 and 10 is 60 comrade. - But you didn't count my king. (laughs) I tell you man, comrade, this is a republic. Here kings don't matter. All right, let's play another game. Even thought you are abroad, act like a German soldier. - 10 and 12, everything's down here, another three. It's ready, Monsieur Haussmann. You bill's right here and it comes to 86 francs and 23 centimes. If I made a mistake, we'll put it right, eh? - Monsieur Rechampot, I have every confidence in you and you'll be paid within three months. - Oh, I'm not worried about it. You always pay on time. Hey, hey, Maryvonne! Hey, Maryvonne! Come down here, our friend is saying goodbye. - [Maryvonne] What? - [Rechampot] He's leaving. Come inside, we'll have a farewell drink. Just a little one. - [Haussmann] I'm sorry, Monsieur Rechampot, but I really should go. - But it's an insult to refuse. Monsieur Haussmann, just take a little wine. - It's a long way and I have to get there by tomorrow night. - And a little drink will give you the strength. - [Haussmann] I'll do it another time, Madam. - [Maryvonne] Come inside. - Thank you again. - Come on. - How are you, soldier? At ease, Corporal. The German Army is really dependent on us, isn't it? - [Man] Without our supplies, caput. - [Rechampot] Please be good enough to pay my respects to your soldiers at the lot. - They're both out in the bush fabricating new Christians. They'll be arriving here in two weeks if nobody eats them. (speaking foreign language) Oh, my dammit. - Look at that, Sergeant. Those Germans are wild soldiers. - [Maryvonne] And give my regards to your officer. - [Haussmann] Yes, Madam, it shall be done. (drums beating) - Too bad, but that's how Germans are. We'd better drink now before Monsieur Rechampot serves it all, huh? - [Man] What's he brought this for? - It was nothing, look at this, it's broken. No good at all. Take it. What could I give you for a thing like this? Here, I'll give you a cross guard. Go on, next one, the next. What have we here? Here, take this. (speaking foreign language) It's nice. We're being kind to exchange your things for a sacred heart card. (speaking foreign language) Can't you see I can't exchange that for more than a sacred heart. (speaking foreign language) Is that worth a cross? (speaking foreign language) What he mean? - He says he wants the color statue, the large one of the female and her infant. He says he thinks his necklace is even more valuable than that. - Well, if he likes his necklace so much he can keep it and I'll keep my sacred heart, here. I'll give you a cross for the rest and that's it. That's it, go on, go on, get out of here. (speaking foreign language) I'm not sure how much longer I can stand it. (speaking foreign language) - You can't expect anything else in this hell hole. The next one, huh? - Step out, the next. (chickens squawking) - Fidele? Fidele? - Yes, Sergeant. - Nothing. - I think that you would like to speak to me about the younger sister, my cousin's brother-in-law, the one I spoke to you about. - No, I didn't mean that. Just talking. - Oh, well, but my cousin says she can do anything the way you like it. - Who taught her, do you know? - Well, the one who visits you, that woman. - Tell her one evening to come by and knock at my door. - I will do it. You'll be satisfied. (chicken clucking) - Beo. Beo, come on now. - No. I'm not in the mood now, Marinette. - Your appetite grows with the eating. - No. - Where did it go? Don't you feel well? (whimsical music) - To Monsieur Lucian Heir, College of Advanced Education, 45 Rue Dunne, Paris, Fesa Randisma, France. From Hubert Fresnoy, care of the administrator, Terrato, du St. Pierre du Samba, French Equator of Africa. (whimsical music) Fort Coulet, January 6, 1915. Dear Professor and, if I may, dear friend. Here I am justly punished for not having been a shining star in classical studies. For then I should now be teaching Greek to clenchens in one of those ridiculous provincial high schools, instead of which I wander freely under a summer sky through a virgin jungle to gather plants or collect specimens of minerals. How lucky for me to be only a simple geographer. (whimsical music) Africa is far from being that special hell described for us in the exaggerated literature of the colonials. Here, where I expected to confront savage beasts, I meet only dogs, cows and chickens, sometimes a few ducks and where I thought I would see ferocious cannibals armed with spears, drums, and poisoned arrows, determined to swallow travelers in one gulp, I meet only friendly country folk who's pastoral lives remind me of the pheasants I knew in many parts of our own land. The main dangers against which I must baffle are first boredom and above all, the association with a handful of our compatriots with whom I must rub elbows much too often. - [Rechampot] Hey, you two are late again. Just because it's my turn to be on watch tonight, you don't have to take such a long siesta, huh? - Don't worry about it. There's lots more for you my wolf (imitating wolf). - [Rechampot] Sure, sure, sure. - [Maryvonne] Don't make a noise. - [Hubert] Where are those fabled builders of empire? Those modern day nights, those fearless pioneers who haunted our dreams inspired by novels of adventure? (hand slapping) (man laughing) - Beg, beg. - [Hubert] I feel very lonely here. For the last six months, what's more, we've not had a single visitor or any mail from France. It appears that these long delays aren't unusual in this part of Africa. But I want to know even more keenly what is going on in Paris. What are they playing in the theaters and at the opera? What is Debussey composing these days? What's happened to Peggy and his poetry? And what's new with our socialist friends? As far as the colonies are concerned, tell them to change their thinking about the inferiority of the blacks. Seen close up, this inferiority has less to do with the shape of the head or the composition of the blood than with the conviction we hold of our own superiority. At the risk of startling you, I have the audacity to affirm that in most aspects, the natives are not far from meriting the honored name of men. But thank you Barthelemy. (crickets chirping) Let me wish you dear teacher and friend a very happy and peaceful 1915, faithfully yours, Hubert Fresnoy. (flame crackling) - There's another lot. Take a look at this junk. Throw it in. - Oh, well, that wasn't too bad. This will keep, too. - Huh, look at this. As the Monsignor says, you couldn't even give it away for charity. - In the provinces maybe. - But taste has limits even in the provinces. - Go ahead. (singing in foreign language) - Oh, how I love this song. (singing in foreign language) - Oh, back's killing me. - Hello, Thomas. How are you? - Fine, thank, Father. - Are you all alone? - All alone, Father. - The other Fathers? - They are not here. - They'll be back tonight, won't they? - I really don't now, Padre. - Ah? - But have they been gone for a long time? - Yes, gone long time. - Long time, much? - Long time it be. - Ah. They left no word for us? - They said, Monsignor say they should join him. - What's going on? - I know nothing about it. - Did they receive anything for Fort Coulet, something for us? - Nothing, Padre. - Well, that's something. - And that's not for us, huh? - No, Padre, not for you. It's for the gentleman who loves plants. - And where does he live, the gentleman who loves plants? - He lives at Fort Coulet. - And where do we live? - You live there in Fort Coulet. - Ah. And it's not for us, the package? - No, no. It is for you (laughs). (crickets chirping) - [Man 1] Damn, least we'll have something to read. - [Man 2] He loves so much to read, he'll get indigestion. (all laughing) - [Woman] Oh, we'll have to wait for next one to go in there like that. (all laughing) - [Hubert] They've assassinated Gyres? - Who? Who's Gyres? - Damn socialists. - Hey, go on. - Monsieur Hubert, you mustn't be upset. - Oh, my God. - Father! - We are at war. - Huh. - Who is? - We are, France. - [Woman 1] But that's ridiculous. - [Woman 2] Since when? - [Man] The third of August. - [Woman] Oh, my God. - Listen, does it say how it came out? - Unfortunately, they only go through the 13th. - But who are we fighting against? - Against Germany, of course. - Oh, really? Against Germany. It would be the English somehow. Oh, my God! - What is it? - But I'm out 86 francs 23 because of this damn war. - Oh, my God. - Because now Germany won't pay. - Hey! - What? - Germany. - Yes. - Is there. - Right. - Huh? - They're right there at clouds. - That's right, the clouds are there. - The colony of Germans. What are we going to do? - [Woman] Luckily they don't know you. - You hear what they're saying Bosselet? - You better wake up Bosselet. - Bosselet, why? Why are you so excited? - Who's excited, I'm not excited. - What are you yelling about? You're forgetting in a case like this, it's the military who takes charge. - Absolutely right and here you're the military. - Well, you are. - Out here, it's him. - And the fact is there's nothing to decide. The motherland's in danger, Vive Le France! - [Together] Vive Le France! Vive Le France! - You won't save Vive Le France with us? - Vive Le France! - [Woman] Vive Le France! - You can't. Think about it. Of your appearance. What you would look like. - We'd look like French patriots, Monsieur. - Like patriotic French soldiers. - But we have no recent news. Perhaps it's finished. - I see, war has hardly begun in this house, you're concerned with finished. - Monsieur Jean Paul, it could be a little plan with a bad finish. Your venture must be planned, well planned, because in war be wary of the Germans. The Germans are too experienced. - Where is all ours, three is all there are. - They're idiots once more. - And listen, their Chief Lieutenant Craft, I don't find him much different than you. - That's right. They're all brain and no muscle. - I think that Lieutenant Craft is a young man who's ill equipped for action. - No, please, Padre, don't become part of this. - El Satoran is where I come from and I fight for France because I'm an (speaking foreign language). And deep inside, I'm French. - I know you think this is a moment to give way to your heart after all. - [Woman] Absolutely right. - All I see is you're out to capture three Germans and why? Those three are without fault, but you alleged Christians all- - What do you mean by alleged? - A band of alleged Christians, who'll accept exposing others to a massacre. - What do you mean? There are only the blacks and us. And that little bunch of soldiers. - That's enough enough Monsieur Rechampot. - Ah, if you please young man, not in that tone. Look out. Here I'm on my own ground. - And this is talk among men. - [Rechampot] I am a respectable businessman, Monsieur. (crickets chirping) - In respect to a log dated July 6, 1900, Recolonial Army organization, and that of February 6, 1912, a recruitment into the Army and all others that are pertinent and because certain signs lead me to admit that a state of war exists between France and Germany, I assume the responsibilities with which I am invested. Now why? Sergeant August Bosselet, command all men of French nationality residing here even temporarily or who may come to reside in Fort Coulet, French Equatorial Africa to place themselves under my orders. Article number one, mobilization is declared right now. (singing in French) Article two, article two, recruitment of native volunteers will start at once. Article 3A, Article 3A, all our precautions are... (singing in French) (cheering) It's better than New Year's Eve Lamont. (all chattering) - Hey, Maris, they're celebrating something. - Howard, when they're like that they may leave us alone tomorrow. (triumphant music) - Come on, come on, this way over here. Oh, no you don't. (all chattering) Order. Go on. - Inhabitants of Fort Coulet, the republic needs you. In the name of France, I appeal now to all men who are healthy, to any man who cares for his home, to any native who wishes to volunteer to help France. The engagement of such volunteers will go forward legally according to recruitment practices. Clothing, footwear and equipment will be provided as supplies for me. And as a special bonus, as long the supply lasts, everyone will receive a free eating utensil graciously furnished by Monsieur LeSapul from his store. The registrars are ready. Go on and join. So much for that. - Listen, Sergeant, they don't comprehend what you said. They need an interpreter. - Too bad for the idiots. It'll come to them someday. Anyway, they agree. - They may agree, but you have to explain it. Marius, did you understand the Sergeant? - But how could I fail to understand? - Then you can explain it to the others. - [Marius] Sure, explain what? - What the hell are you doing here? Get the hell back to the store! Stay near that cash box. - All right, this way, you understand now, fine. All right, this way. - Nobody helps. No one. - [Man] Put your finger there, that's right. - Mouth open. Ah. - Ah. - We're going to give you a name, wait just a second. Satrionat. Yes, Satrionat. - Stand over there, go, go on. Open your mouth, ah. - Your name will be Armul. (speaking foreign language) Armul. (whimsical music) - Armul. Armul. (whimsical music) - No, I don't want this pot, I don't like it. - Now then my boy, you don't like it? - [Man] Too small. - All right, then, give him another one. - All right, I'll take this one. I like this one better. - Good I put down two, I only gave him one. (whimsical music) - Open your mouth. - It's written here. Your name Ciprion now. Campor, you're a volunteer now, huh? - Alistead. - Ah. - [Man] Very good, excellent. - Ah. - [Man] Good, marvelous. Ah. - All right. - Uh. - What's wrong. (speaking foreign language) - You're volunteer Ipoli. - Ipoli. Oh, sure, I know your sister well. (whimsical music) - All right, shall we go? Is that all of them? - Yes. - [Man] So many guns. - And that counts for two, four, six. - Four, five, six, seven. Keep your hands off, that's two, four, six, eight, ten. - No, 12, I counted 12 this morning. - I guess you're right. That make 12 guns on our table. (rooster crowing) Good, plus five hunting guns over here, one of which is an automatic. Return to order. Well, that makes six and six, 12 and six, 18. Listen, if you men don't shut up, I'll make a mistake. - [Man] All right, count them again, then. - Six and five, 11. Six and five, 11 and six, 17 and 12. 17. 12. - 29. - [Man] 29. 17 and 12 make 29. No question. - Yes, that's right. - If that's right. - [Man] In the name of God, it shouldn't be too long. - As to ammunition, I verified it. There are six dry cases and two over there. - [Priest] You see, Sergeant, God is on our side. - [Man] Of course, brother, God is French. - Fine. As to the volunteers, I'll need a week to teach them the bare rudiments. - What? All that time? That's foolish. They don't eat much, but it costs the same anyway. We're not running a ponceon. - Well, all they need to learn is to hold a gun and load a bullet. And even if they're idiots, to learn that shouldn't take more than a day. - Regulations require a minimum of instruction. - But my poor friend, you can't form an Army with them. I know you didn't know about it, but we've been at war six months. - It's obvious is you plan an effective surprise, delay is bad. - You're absolutely right. I propose this Sunday. - What's that? - [Man] Why not? - This Sunday you mean? To accomplish that you must leave tomorrow at the latest. - That's what I mean. - I think Sunday is the best day to begin attacking. The protestants are in their churches pretending. They're distracted in the morning and so we arrive, bam, and bless them as they deserve, huh? - Well, aside from a lot of considerations, you can't lose anything by choosing God's day. - Even so, tomorrow night, it's a bit early. (trumpet music) (drums beating) (speaking foreign language) - Altar boy, get up, out of here, get out of the way. - Thank you very much. - So, my son, you chose the infantry, huh? (crickets chirping) - I want to speak with you for a minute. I intend to speak with the Germans at once when I get there. If Monsieur Craft is as much like me as I hear, I'm sure that he should be easy to convince that with 10 against one, resistance is useless. However, my attempt would be more successful if one you came with me. - No Monsieur Fresnoy. - But why? - You can't approach Germans. You don't comprehend their mentality at all, Monsieur. - But right not it's yours I'm not comprehending. - Oh, look at that. He looks pretty chic this morning. - Wait till my brother gets here. - Well, my friend, take a look at the ambassadors of French good taste. Ladies, are you going to keep us waiting much longer? - I'll be there at a minute. - Look how tiny your waist is. - A delicate orchid. Oh, she's so pretty. (girls giggling) It's now 9:41. 1915, a fine day on the morning of January 22nd. We are making ready to leave our country. The boundary of the land of good living ends here. There begins the land of our enemy, which we shall conquer by force. A raptor that could easily be the Rhine. In fact it is! Let is cross the Rhine, even though by an unfortunate set of circumstances, this is only a modest stream. (whimsical music) Opla! - Opla! - Hey, Bosselet, send all of the colors. The colors, the colors. (patriotic music) (girls giggling) - [Man] You saved the colors. - All right, quickly, come, come. This way, this way, pal. That's it, come on, careful. - Ooh, how exciting, ah. - Come on everyone, follow me this way. This way. (whimsical music) All right, there it is, there it is. We've arrived, I recognize the place. There, right there through the leaves. Over there, over there, the two white spots, that's it, that's a post. - There's no point going further, it's too hot. - Yes, it's hot. - Hey, Bosselet, we'll leave you. We'll stop here, but you go right on. - We'll see you later. - Yes, but you know our hearts are with you, eh? Now there, there. The shade is deeper. And we'll be able to see everything without being near. So we'll set down. All right, that's all. Halt! Set us down, didn't you hear? Set us down. (patriotic music) - Now Maison Rechampot is happy to offer you an aperitif and spectacle that is not only refined, but patriotic. The like of which is rarely seen even in the best resorts and spas. It's possible that his honor, the marquee of geography will come celebrate. - Where is Hubert? Where is he? - I saw him. - Where is he? - I don't know. - Hubert. - Hubert. - Over there! - Where's he going? Fresnoy, Fresnoy, don't go, come back! Fresnoy. Fresnoy, come back Fresnoy! Where are you going? - Are you crazy or what, go on, get over here. Young man, you listen to me. I know you've been to school. I'm sure you're very brainy, but here we are in charge. It's our business. This affair is serious, it could be tragic and bigger than all of us. This is war. There's no place for fantasies, you understand? - You're mobilized the same as we are. - Yes, that's right. - And there's no escape for anyone. - It's really curious, his mentality. - You're right, you may fool around with geography after all, but us, we create history. - Marius, pass the bubble. You'll drink with us now. You'll drink the same as everyone. Weak stomach or no weak stomach. You must toast France. - Assomption, Assomption, Monsieur Rechampot asked me to find out when your chickens will be ready. He wants to know. - They'll be ready when they done. - This tail is the white man, 20 minutes. - I'm getting drunk. Oh, Vive Le France. To our eight soldiers. (guns firing) - [Man] That's the way Bosselet. He's really letting them have it. - It's so quiet. - Will you pass me some of the- - Shh. (guns firing) (rifle firing) - The Germans must have a machine gun. - They what? What did he say? - A machine gun, madam. A machine gun, I think they're right. - [Woman] What is a machine gun? - Bastards, oh, my, call it a machine gun or whatever. It's wrong. Should it continue, let's fold up and get out of here quickly, quickly. - Come! - Put everything together. I'll get this. Hurry! (all chattering) My God, what does he want? - Assomption. - What's he saying? - The volunteer says I fell in a deep hole. I wasn't able to see. They hole was hidden by many green branches. At the bottom there was a sharp stick. The volunteer says we must search and get his friend out of the hole. The stick pierced his friend's stomach. - Have pity on us. Others are coming. - Help. Help. - Lulu, Lulu, calm down. - Don't worry. No need to get excited. - The volunteer says I feel in a deep hole and in the hole there is- - We know, we know all of that. - Oh, my God dammit, it can't be possible. Look at that. - Get out! All of you! Go on, get away from here. Well, you know any doctors in the area? Do you? There aren't any doctors, not a one. Get on. - Right away. - Come on. - Come on, let's get out of here, come on. - [Woman] Oh, what a bunch of idiots. - I want all the bearers, let's go, let's go, let's go. - Father. Father. Father. Father, you understand we finally only lost one man, the bugler, so let the bosh come any time. We still have six riflemen. - But I don't think they will. The main thing after all, the Germans can't be savages all together. We know them, don't we, huh? And among white men we can always talk. - Unless we killed one. - What are you talking about? We didn't have time. Don't let it concern you, we looked terrible. Get away, get away. Go on, go on, don't you have any shame. - Chief, I got it all back, Chief. Nothing is missing. - Mr. Fresnoy, you are a witness to my first defeat. But you can't have been a witness to my second defeat. This was my first combat. (flies buzzing) - Chief. (man coughing) - We mustn't have any illusions. With their supplies and arms, they can destroy is when they like and where they like. We have had it Mr. Fresnoy, completely. I acted like an idiot. It's normal, I am one. (Hubert knocking) Not now, my dear, go away, some other evening. (speaking foreign language) Friday's good. Another night, dear, if you're passing by. - [Hubert] It's me, Sergeant. - I'm sorry, Monsieur Fresnoy. What's happening? What's the matter? - Sergeant, I would like to speak with you. I think you and I understand each other. - That's very nice of you to say. I'm sure you understand. In six years I retire. I was writing the whole thing in my report. It's too bad about the bugler. It's the regulations. If you get six soldiers, you've got to account for six. And it's just they're counted the same as white men. - You may have to account someday Bosselet, but I'm here to say you're under pressure to do it. They other insisted on their own way. - I wasn't sold on it, not sold at all. - Do you imagine the others can get us out of the mess they've put us in? - The others. If you only knew them, who they are. - So what now, Bosselet? What are you going to do. - I'll finish my report. - No, I meant to ask, do you know where you're heading. - For the time being, I've taken certain precautions. - And for tomorrow, have you a plan? - Oh, yes, there's a plan. Yes, I'll... I have no plan. - Sit down, will you? I have two or three ideas to propose to remedy the situation. I know quite well war's a thing you don't learn about in school and you know me mainly as a geographer. But I've studied a good deal of history, as well. - Well, you have my confidence Mr. Fresnoy. - Idea number one, war is something too serious to leave in the hands of storekeepers. - On that we're entirely in accord. - Good, then follow me. (man knocking) (speaking foreign language) - What is it! - (speaking foreign language) No surrender, no, no. No surrender. - You've had a nightmare. - I thought I dreamt it. - No, no, no, no, Assomption. There's no one, everything's all right. It's all right. - I said there's someone here and nobody there answers. - It's only me, Bosselet. - Oh, good, good. Ah, come in. - Excuse us for disturbing you. - But we weren't asleep yet. - No, we weren't asleep. - Sergeant Bosselet determined the moment's arrived to estimate the consequences of yesterday's mishap. I'm in charge of estimating the means of our disposal to correct the situation at the Sergeant's request. But I realize that nothing we do can succeed without the total adherence of our community. That's why we came to consult you. - That's a very wise decision. - We are very flattered you came to us. - The fact is I really discount the German attack for the next two or three nights. I'm sure they'll have to check up on their equipment first. And so the danger facing us, that danger that's immediate shall begin at night, either Thursday or Friday. It's a delay, a short one. - So, what you mean is it doesn't leave us much time. - Something else is due to the character, improvised, amateurish and imbecilic of yesterday's demonstration. It's clear we mustn't expect any show of mercy, especially father from the German mentality. - That is extremely probable. - And so we agree. Sergeant, will you get our friends to the club in 10 minutes. - In 10 minutes, right. - Should we be there, as well. - Well, yes, of course. - What the hell is going on? I won't be led around by the nose. This is a republic, dammit, we're free men. - Paul? - Huh? - You're a horse's ass. - What? - Monsieur Rechampot, what is it you have to propose? We came here to consider everyone's idea. Do you know what it is you want? - Well, we know what we want, of course. - We want, we don't want the Germans to come here. - [Hubert] And say that they do? - Say that they do, we surrender. - Surrender. - You are right, but not me. Not me, Paul. Surrender to a German, no Frenchman would. - Yes, yes, he's right. Of course, if Monsieur Fresnoy finds another way, I won't surrender. I won't do it with all the merchandise in my store. So, Monsieur Fresnoy, there's a response. If they attack, we don't surrender, there. The main thing is they mustn't attack. - What then if they come? - If they come, we don't surrender, but they mustn't get here. - That's right. - If that's what you expect of me, I have two or three ideas to propose. One thing is certain, Monsieur Rechampot's merchandise can be very important to us. - Oh, well, important, important, but it's not enormous. - Paul, don't begin again. Stop it. When destiny puts you in such circumstances, you must forget about business affairs. - Absolutely, Monsieur Caprice, so I propose tomorrow you depart for St. Pierre du Samba. - Good, Monsieur Hubert. - Sergeant Bosselet will entrust you with a sealed envelope to be handed to the military authorities. Your mission is to bring us back precise instructions and all the men and material you can find. - But why me? There's my store to run, I must be there. - Everybody has a store, Caprice. Go on, go on, do as he says. - [Caprice] Yes, but there are two of you, why doesn't your brother go? - Well, because my brother is, he's, uh, stupid. - The reason we chose you is you're the most apt for this delicate task. So we mustn't get bogged down in business. - And at the moment, the shop's only fair, so. - [Priest] That's right. - So maybe I might keep an eye on it. - Well, if everybody agrees. - Well, of course. - We agree. - [Woman] We all agree, don't we? - Until you reinforce us, how will you defend us? The Sergeant frankly says the volunteers just disappear and there are no more miracles. We're going to need natives badly. - As you just explained, there are no more miracles. Nobody asked miraculous things of you. (singing in foreign language) - Monsieur Hubert, Monsieur Hubert. Oh, Monsieur Hubert, what's going to happen to us? Oh, you seem nervous, too. Oh, what shall we do? Monsieur Hubert. I'm so scared. (whimsical music) (both laughing) (speaking in foreign language) (man whistling) (speaking in foreign language) - Inside, just go inside. You know where it is. - Jacques, Jacques. Downstairs. Give me a hand. For you, me and Maryvonne, in case everything turns sour, there. Can't you stop making noise, you idiot, you. We should add some sugar and some beans and corned beef and something else. Two boxes of sardines, eh? - Plus a few bottles of wine. - Fine, we'll just say that they are missing. (man knocking) - If you please, the floor pads. - Of course. Monsieur Fresnoy, good day. - Sit down, will you. - Thank you. - And so? - Men have fled. The villages are vacant. - All? - Everyone. - But we've learned since this morning it is certain the Lieutenant Craft has been recruiting with great success. - Germans. - Germans. - So what do you propose? - I'm afraid there's nothing we can do. The Germans want them as soon as we leave here. - We can't beat them because of the Germans. We are powerless. - That's right. We alone can't beat them. (rooster crowing) (drums beating) - Pay my respects to the chief. (speaking foreign language) - The chief says I am proud. It is great honor to receive white people in my home. - Tell the chief I am here because his village is in great danger. (speaking foreign language) - The chief says I know that. - Tell him his villages have attacked white men. The German white men want revenge. The Germans are very ferocious. (speaking foreign language) - [Man] The chief says I know. - For the French to defend his village takes 100 men. (speaking foreign language) - He says a hundred men are not to be had. The best were lost in the great battle. He cannot help you. (speaking foreign language) - There are many men in the villages below the Savannah. If the chief captured a lot of men from those tribes, there wouldn't be a battle for his village. (speaking foreign language) - [Man] He says I can capture many of those savages. There are many of them and they are very strong but very stupid. He says those of my village have always been enemies to the Savannahs. He says why did you not think of it sooner. (speaking in foreign language) - All right, Monsieur is waiting. (man knocking) - How many prisoners did they catch, huh, our partners. - What? - I said how many did they trap? How many did our partners trap. - With those from this morning, 19. - You could say what you want. It's some men. - You can say that again, yes. - And you knew Fresnoy from a distance. You know him, you really have to, you have to live with him. - I see. I had to live with the man, you know. - [Bosselet] I know. - I was against his ideas, you know. - [Bosselet] I know that, too. - But as you realize, he's got the brains. - But is he nice? When you know him intimately, is he nice? Tell me. - No, nice isn't the word for him. No, nice isn't the word. I mean, I guess he can be, but I guess it's more that he's mainly. - He's what? - Terribly refined. That's it, terribly refined and the man's unchanged. We're always saying he's young, he's educated and a bit embarrassed to be with us, but the whole thing's very clear. Despite his education, he's a man. - I'll be he's a virgin, poor dear. - I would put my hand in the fire on it. - Your hand's not what you're supposed to put. (all laughing) - Madam Rechampot. - Some madam, with my two husbands. - Oh, no, don't listen to her. - Oh, no, Madam Caprice, you must listen to her. To Monsieur Hubert. - All right, to Monsieur Hubert. - Monsieur Hubert. - You list in your inventory submitted to me, you list only a hundred pounds of sugar. - Yes, that's right. That's exact, though it's not here anymore. There's an enormous demand. With all the events, I haven't had a delivery since, let's see, it's been June of last year, understand? - Yet Madam Caprice in the same situation. - That's right, the poor thing. - Declares her store has 280 pounds. - Marius! White men are talking. - Well, the noise is the broom. - Well, the point is she and I don't have the same clientele. They're small retailer and us, we're wholesalers, huh? - We are wholesalers. - Fine, then we'll see. (speaking foreign language) - It may seem strange, but in order of cause of business, wholesaler can have much less stock than a retailer. It's well known. But go right ahead, you can check, you can check. - Monsieur Fresnoy, Monsieur Fresnoy, my brother, he forced me. - [Rechampot] You big liar. Who hid these things here? You must have. - The yellow speckled leaf in the second autumn surrenders gently all its golden grape to the fruit gatherers, thus will fall the passing flours of life you love pleasure seeking beauty. (speaking foreign language) - Watch me, I'll drink. (speaking foreign language) It's the white man's drink. It makes you strong after. Here, drink, it's good for you. - That makes 20. A round number. Monsieur Fresnoy, you understand it's getting more difficult. In three days, we haven't captured a one. - I asked him for a hundred men, but he sends these cripples. The chief must think he's pulling one over. Too bad. - Why take it up with him? - Tell the chief I haven't come here for any more nonsense. Tell him he promised many warriors. He's not kept his promise. Because of that I shall not keep my word and his men shall battle. (speaking foreign language) - The chief says there are may captives who know just where the others are hiding. - And so aren't his men able to ferret it out? (speaking foreign language) - The chief says they asked him, but those captives all refused to talk. To get knowledge you'd have to mutilate Sampotali. They'd be useless. (rooster crows) - Goddamn it, it's for us. - It's serious Sergeant? - Both serious and important. - Let's see it. - Not for you, it's for your brother. - It's for my brother? I have no brother anymore. It's for you, Cain, look, look at that yellow belly. - Decision number 21, a military squad is herein created to obtain the necessary information in order to recruit a native villager to aid in the defense of Fort Coulet. The commander of the squad is Mr. Rechampot, Jacques Victor Louie, signed Fresnoy and that fixes you. - [Rechampot] Well, say something you idiot. - I'm going out. I'm so happy. - [Rechampot] Would you believe that stupid ass? (patriotic music) (people applauding) See what you can do if you try. Hurrah for the squad. - Hurrah for the squad! - Bravo! (bell ringing) - The priests want to see you. - Send them in. - Come in. Floor polishers. - Sit down, won't you? - I hope we're not disturbing you. Father John and I had some, had been thinking that there are certain measures that could be useful in grasping the problem in all its delicate aspects. Aspects that in the circumstances might be considered as secondary, but these aspects must never entirely be neglected by a Christian conscious. - Go on will you. - Everybody's talking about it. Rumors. - They are from natives, I must tell you. - They make us think that certain means may be used to gain certain accomplishments. - Sometimes thought of as praise worthy. - [Father John] Means I do not quite know how to express it. - [Priest] Whether or not in keeping with the respect of even the humblest creature. - Monsieur Rechampot under my orders is trying to preserve your security. - Because we've heard rumors about brutalities and injuries. - Did you hear about the wounded who were abandoned to die? Did you hear about the Christians consciences who fled the spectacle of their agony without so much as giving them a drop of water? That same conscience that refused to raise a finger to prevent this slaughter. Remember it wasn't I who wanted this war. - [Priest] The saber. - [Crowd] The saber. - [Priest] The lead bullet. - [Crowd] The lead bullet. - The rifle. - The rifle. - [Priest] The grenade. - [Crowd] The grenade. - [Priest] The firing pick. - [Crowd] The firing pick. - Good day, Sergeant. Monsieur Fresnoy, good day. - [Priest] The rifle. - [Crowd] The rifle. - The bayonet. - [Crowd] The bayonet. - No, the bayonet, the bay. - [Crowd] They bay. - Yo. - [Crowd] Yo. - Net. - [Crowd] Net. - The bayonet. - [Crowd] The bayonet. - [Priest] The bayonet. - [Crowd] The bayonet. - [Priest] No, the bayonet. - [Crowd] The bayonet. - [Man] It's here father, the bicycle, quick. (men chanting) - Ha! - [Crowd] Amen. Amen. - Whites are braver than you are, but why? (speaking foreign language) Because white men have a better God. Our God up there can give us strength. This is a bicycle and a black who tries to ride it falls. All right, who wants to drive? All right, you there, you, you look strong. (triumphant music) All right, here goes. Look and see what the powerful God of the white man can do. (circus music) (speaking foreign language) - And the recruit says to the Father, this is a machine for whites. That the white man God doesn't give help to blacks. - All right, Assomption, you try it. Now you see he's black. - You see? - But he trusts the great God of the whites. (speaking foreign language) (circus music) - [Man] Halt, halt, who goes there. Champagne? - [Caprice] Don't be an ass, eh? It's me, Caprice. - [Man] Champagne. What's the password. You have to answer Moet. - [Caprice] Moet, is that all right? - [Man] Good, pass on. - Good evening Monsieur Caprice. - [Caprice] Good evening. - Good evening, Monsieur Caprice. - [Caprice] Uh, Moet, huh? - No one can be admitted. No one can be admitted. - Is Fresnoy in? - Monsieur Fresnoy is in. What's it for? - It's my business. I'm not telling you anything. You gonna give me that doorknob? - No, I am not. - Oh? What's wrong boy, what's wrong with you. - I'm not boy. The name's Barthelemy. - You remember who I am, huh? You recognize me? - Oh, yes, you're Monsieur Caprice. - That's right. You know where I been? - Oh, yes, St. Pierre du Samba. Complete the document. - Now you just watch it. Don't play games with me. I'm warning you. He's been expecting me for three months. For three months I ran myself ragged bringing him his things, grenades plus everything else. - Ah, that's splendid. How many cases? - Animal. Fresnoy! Hey, Fresnoy! - You can't pass inside. You'll see the master tomorrow. - Good day. - Good day. - You can't mean it. With the Negress? - I'm telling you, I swear it. Bosselet, you could comprehend, but not with him. - Is she attractive? - Attractive? The same as any other Negress. (man whistling) (speaking foreign language) (man whistling) - [Maryvonne] Ah, yes, we all have our share of misery. - Ah, how awful. - Ah, yes. (triumphant music) - Monsieur Caprice, you took on a mission that was difficult. In all regards, I want to state publicly that you accomplished it in magnificent fashion. Madam, you should be proud of your husband. - I am, thank you, Monsieur Hubert. Oh, pardon, Monsieur Fresnoy. Mademoiselle. - Madam. - Mademoiselle. - Monsieur Fresnoy, would you take your place? (drums beating) (Hubert applauding) (crowd applauding) - Attention! Right shoulder arms! Present arms! Company at ease! One, two, three. (singing in foreign language) - I'm sure that you will pass a pleasant Sunday afternoon. - We'd be pleased if you spent it with us, won't you? - Alas, no, Madam, we must leave. - [Maryvonne] Oh. - [Hubert] Madam, Monsieur. - Oh, my goodness. Well, then. (flies buzzing) - Before you go, I want to demonstrate how they manage with the grenades. - That's an idea, it'll do them good. - [Maryvonne] It didn't go down well with me. - I didn't mind it. - I'm not speaking of Martine. I didn't want to talk before Bosselet. I mean, the Negress. - Let us not judge, Madam. There are quirks in that young man's nature that are bizarre. And in his attitude is a definite desire to provoke his fellows. But there's one thing he merits, he did give us our peace and security. - So, he's allowing us to live just as we're accustomed to. - All right, let's go. Execution. - Grenade exercise, throw! - [Bosselet] Good, all right, back. Next. (grenade exploding) - Fire! - Fire! - Long live the republic. Forward! (guns firing) (triumphant music) - What a break. Our men took them by surprise. I must say I didn't expect it. - Yes, me, too. - That's very good. - Bring the first sections. Get going, get them to the pitcher. - I hope it's strong enough today. - Wait, you didn't drink you. Now fill your mouth. You must swallow it all down, open. Pretty good, huh? Next. - [Man] He thinks it's too strong. (man laughing) - That's the real stuff, huh? Next. You're a real fighting man. (guns firing) - [Man] Fire, fire. (guns firing) (speaking in foreign language) (men grunting) - Congratulations. It's as good as French as we saw in the newspaper and without the mud, too. - That's for sure. - With Monsieur Fresnoy in charge, we're not going to wait for irenicism to give him hell and beat the boss. - [Man 1] Soldiers of the French brand. - [Man 2] Have you machine guns? - [Man 1] We have more clothes. (man coughing) - [Priest] It's not true. We're going to win. God is on our side. - [Father John] Yes. - Just rest. The Lord is with you. How's it going. - All right. There's one who's dying. - In there? - Yeah. - Let's go in. - What a mess. - There, there. Doesn't look good. Do you lose many like this? - Two or three men a week more or less. - This week, he will be the sixth man loss. - Is there nothing to do? - [Priest] Wait till the rain stops. (man coughing) - The French are going to beat you. (whimsical music) - Fresnoy! Ho! Fresnoy! Marius, you're going to tell Monsieur Fresnoy everything you told me. - A ran a lot, I ran. It's the priest and Madon, they left Fort Coulet to arrive here. They are arriving with the soldiers. These soldiers want to talk to you today. - What do you think it's about Bosselet? You think they sent reinforcement? - Could be a trick. You're not playing a joke? - No, I seen the soldiers with my eyes. - They are French soldiers? - No, can't be French. - Germans? - Oh, no, no Germans, I'm sure. - All right the, who are they? - Well, Monsieur, I know nothing about it. How am I supposed to know about these soldiers. Their chief is a black man. (bagpipe music) - Over there, see them, there. - Give me your hand, will you. - Let go of his leg. - Don't grab my feet, idiot. - Give me your hand. - Now you can see. - Right over there. The branch. That's it. - [Man] Come on. - [Rechampot] Yes, they're advancing. - [Man] There are a lot of them. - [Rechampot] Yes, that is true, it's with Bosselet now. (bagpipe music) - I'm Captain Taji Kapur of the 57th Colonial Infantry. I, who is in charge here? - I am, Captain. - Good Lord. Oh, well, John? - Yes, sir. - Will you help me with the details, please? - Yes, sir. I propose to tell you the details of the Captain's pronouncement. - Following the surrender of the imperial forces on the 6th of February in Yaounde. - Yes, sir, the Germans all surrender to our armies at Yaounde. After severe fighting, the allied government then decided to issue orders to the German Army in this area to surrender at once. The Captain is carrying these orders which say in effect, stop the battle, the war finished, stop and surrender. - They must surrender to me. According to the London Inter-Ally Convention, this part of the territory is now under the control of his gracious majesty. I am in charge of setting up British authority here. - Germans in the area shall surrender their Army to Captain Taji Kapur. You may ask by why, huh? Because in London, the allied governments decided amongst each other to take this territory and award it to his gracious majesty, so we are here to take possession of it. - And what can the French do? - The Captain would like to freshen up I dare say. - Oh, yes, bravo. (man humming) - You know, I have never seen a soldier in skirts before, they must fight women. - Haven't you ever seen a decent army of French savages? - Not until we've seen you in your skirts, Monsieur. - Hey, you, the smart one, come on over here. Come here for a minute. Now then, listen, I want to ask, in that talk in London, it specified what's ours stays French? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, we understood perfectly. It stays French up to the point where it was German. - [Man] Exactly. - Fine. If that's a fact, only one thing changes. It's that the Negros who are German are now English. - [Man] Exactly. - Well, my lad, I'll tell you one thing. Serves them right. - For inspection! Present! - Arms. (patriotic music) - How do you do? - Captain Taji Kapur. - Lieutenant Craft. - Monsieur Craft. Come here, Monsieur Craft, don't be bashful. I'm glad to see you. - How are you, Monsieur Rechampot? - The whole thing was really something, eh? - How are you Monsieur Caprice? - This is- - [Craft] Very good to see you again. - Monsieur Craft, I must introduce you to- (all chattering) You know, he's the young man who gave you so much trouble. Without him, you would have not met Monsieur Haussmann. Well, well, well, you put on weight, Monsieur. (singing in French) - Madon? - [Man] Yes, Sergeant. - Nothing. (singing in French) - White men, white men. - If you're giving thought to your little bill, I wouldn't worry a thing about it. We'll settle your bill. - Ah, theology. You know at a certain moment I was interested. But I must say that theologists are less well educated than yours. You've studied at which university? - Heidelberg. - Ah. That's pretty obvious. You're going to laugh at this. I was a socialist. - Ah. Naturally, of course. So was I. (whimsical music) (technological music)
