It's hard to say what's more ridiculous, to stand in front of a camera, or behind it. But since the non-cinematic reality is no less ridiculous, then the most elegant solution would probably be to turn everything into a film. And to set the film on fire. It isn't a sex film. It is a film entitled "Sex". Yes, I'm still looking for the script. Getting her pregnant, signing her on a contract. That's it... A contract that has been drawn up and signed in Tel Aviv on the day ta-ta-tam between ta-ta-tam the undermentioned party of the first part and the ta-ta-ta-tam undermentioned party of the second part. Party of the second part... Do you, David Avidan, take these women to be your lawful wedded wives? No, thank you. Spread your legs a bit. The burden of proof is on the prosecution. You know, Avidan, I'd really like to get married young. With a nice, warm house, and at least four kids. I might actually marry you, if you had some... means. - I don't have much... means. - Me neither. Too bad. A marriage with you would break me financially. And break you personally. Yes, that really wouldn't work. Will you invite me to your wedding? Sure, why not. Divorced from marriage, but married to divorce. Should the party of the second part be interested in having the party of the first part's son and/or daughter... And what if I'm pregnant? Why would you be! And should the party of the second part have communicated this desire to the party of the first part... If I'm having a baby, it won't be yours. And should the party of the first part to express a general consent to the party of the second part's aforementioned desire... And should the party of the first part to express his general consent. And should the party of the first part to express his general consent. And should the party of the first part to express his consent. And should the party of the first part to express his consent. And should the party of the first part to express. And should the party of the first part to express. And should the party of the first part. And should the party of the first part. And should the party. And should the party. And should the party. Don't you want to be a dad? You really don't want to be a dad? The first thing that calls me "dad", I'm picking up a gun and shooting it. Dad! In the matter of William Tell, the apple is important too. Ingredients: A child-sized apple, and an apple-sized child. Usage instructions: Head on top of head, according to the aforementioned scale. Side effects: Fairy tales, more tragic and less heroic. Doctor's instructions: The imagination of the apple's heart is evil from its youth. And he who spares his crossbow, hates his son. Thesis for discussion in the event of deterioration: The safety of the apple as the existential challenge of the marksman, contrasted with the safety of the child as the existential challenge of the apple. This film is open to any kind of explosion. Explosion of houses, explosion of interpersonal relationships, and even the explosion of film productions, which are themselves open to any kind of explosion. They won't let you love in this country. They won't let you love in this country. - Want some? - Yes. - Let's go. - Fine. - Wait a minute. - Okay. They won't let you love in this country! Don't we know each other from somewhere? It's possible. It's never too late. Do you bathe often? Do you bathe alone, usually? Usually... Isn't that boring? It's very pleasant when you're alone. I think it's best to sleep alone, but bathe with others. Much better than sleeping with others, but bathing alone. The daring thesis that is now seeing the light of day for the first, and possibly last, time. The noble and discrete manner of the impregnation of the Virgin Mary probably answers a need that is common among not only all virgins, but almost all women, the longing to be taken from the inside. There's no need to be a Christian, specifically, to understand that only the Holy Spirit can answer this aching need. Because this need is, of course, mainly spiritual. From the inside, secretly, with minimal pain and maximal divine protection. And, no less importantly, all at once. But whenever Mary's unique impregnation is mentioned, often forgotten is her direct, earthly and frustrated victim: her husband. And even if the fact that his name is Joseph is remembered, his profession is, for some reason, often ignored. The carpenter, the carpenter, the carpenter constantly in the background. Without him, the building of the cross could never be described. As for Jesus, son of Joseph, he probably suffered from what can be, with some caution, defined as a reverse Oedipal comlex. He was jealous of his mother for the fact that the Holy Spirit has visited her instead of him. It is probable that the persona of Jesus was of a somewhat homosexual nature. Do you think that we look sufficiently clean? Do you feel that this situation is a sexual one or a hygienic one? It's a comfortable and warm situation. Okay, dear lady, this has been interesting, but beds and baths are things one must at some point leave. I always believed that I possess a very photogenic penis. Well, our new script-girl. (French) Very tasty, if you ask me. (Russian) Psychological situation: open. (French) Physiological situation: closed. (French) So, you pissed well, my love? (French) Urological situation: comfortable. (French) Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Heil! Heil! Heil! Something new. Something brown. (Polish) Nothing new. And nothing brown. (Polish) And what are you doing here? Ah! I'm the one from the red joke! Oh, my ex-wife. I heard that she gave birth to something. Yours? Obviously not yours. - Male? Female? - Female. Mmm! Okay, okay! - Ex-wife? - Ex-wife. So, all your wives are in fact your ex-wives? Even my future wives are my ex-wives. So what if I'm a virgin? If we're already talking about virginity, we should observe a virginity in its natural size. Even though virginity is a fairly unnatural phenomenon nowadays. So what if I'm not a virgin? In this movie, I'm not taking my clothes off. So how in your opinion am I supposed to get you pregnant? Pregnant? No way! - We're not in a relationship. - But there is however a contract. So how in your opinion am I supposed to get you pregnant? So how in your opinion... So how in your opinion am I supposed to... So how in your opinion am I supposed to... Mmm! Definitely not yours. Definitely not yours. Definitely not yours. Definitely not yours. Definitely not yours. - Just say "okay" already! - Okay, okay... The party of the second part has informed the party of the first part that she was married in a civil ceremony in Cyprus to an Israeli man by the name of... You haven't told me that you have a... The party of the first part, with the consent of the party of the second part, has decided not to check and/or to verify this matter. The party of the second part promises, in advance and irrevocably, not to pester the party of the first part with lawsuits and/or requests, if and when the party of the second part is impregnated by the party of the first part. Please forgive me, Mr. Avidan, but I happen to be the mother of one of your... Never mind. Is she still there? What do you exactly mean by "there"? I didn't know you had a mother. Can I speak to her? I'm afraid she isn't too fully awake at the moment. Oh, that's alright. Look, dear lady, your daughter is happily slumbering in my bed. Do you suggest that we wake her up immediately, or that we let her sleep peacefully until morning? Goodness. Listen, mister. You just wait right there. I'm coming over. She is coming. Oy, an orgy! The animals went in four by four, hurrah, hurrah! The animals went in four by four, hurrah, hurrah! The animals went in four by four, reality with metaphor, and they all, tum, tum, tum, just to get out of the rain. The animals went in four by four, reality with metaphor, da da, da, da, da, just to get out of the rain. Reality with metaphor, just to get out of the rain. Reality with metaphor, just to get out of the rain. The animals went in four by four, reality with metaphor, ha, ha. The animals went in four by four, ha, ha, ha. The animals went in four by four, reality with metaphor, here, here! The animals went in four by four, hurrah! - Here, here! - Here, here! But why do you have to fornicate with every single woman? Female. It isn't a sex film. It is a film entitled "Sex". It isn't a sex film. It is a film entitled "Sex". It isn't a sex film. It is a film entitled "Sex". Go on, go on. Look, I admit that the sexual problem is hard for me to deal with at the moment. But that's exactly why I won't be able to make an official statement to your female readers regarding this matter, okay? Go on, go on. Female. Look, I'm not even sure that I love you. As if that's something you'd know anything about. You'd be surprised. Can I see a menu? We're being asked about what we've managed to accomplish here so far. Do they think that all this foam is all Bat Oren soap? How do you say in Hebrew, "tendresse"? "Pleasure". That's not something you have. Excuse me, can I hit on you? Can I hit you? The guitar... Will have you dream until you weep Will have you dream until you weep The guitar... The cry of the lost soul The guitar... Will have you dream until you weep Will have you dream until you weep The guitar... The guitar... The guitar... Moscow speaking. (Russian) Good morning. Temperature two degrees below zero. (Russian) Wissotzky Tea raises it to zero. (Russian) In half a minute, we will broadcast the latest news bulletin. (Russian) Radioactivity is very... As opposed to atomic weapons, conventional weapons are still sensitive to what we may call "a nice landscape". And this has, by the way, a very practical reason. Their operators know that these weapons can at most make changes to things in the landscape. But not the landscape itself. Because of that same reason the atomic weapon is not sensitive to the landscape. It doesn't even concern itself with the landscape. It just cancels it. Sorry, Mr. Avidan, no pregnancy. Better luck next time. No? Thank you. The party of the second part will give up, in advance and irrevocably, the argument that she has been impregnated or will be impregnated by anyone except the party of the first part. Beginning from this moment and for a period of 3 months. Absolutely no abortion. Ho. Thank you. Kiss my ass! At the time and place that are convenient for us. Fuck the IDF, not me! Merde of the Maccabees. [Sounds like: "Maccabean Revolt"] To turn everything into a film, and to set the film on fire.
