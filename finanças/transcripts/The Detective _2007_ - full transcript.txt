I don't see anyone following you She is following me You have her picture. So you know who she is. Why don't you report to the police? I don't know who she is Where did you get this picture? It's not your business. You just need to help me find her. Tell her that I have nothing to do with that matter. Tell her don't kill me She wants to kill you? Why? I don't know Do you know where she lives? No. If I know where she lives I don't need your help You want to chase this girl, right? You don't know where she lives. So you come up with this lame story that she wants to kill you, and have me dig out her address? No!... Yes, she is following me. I don't know what you're talking. Hey, are you drunk? Go home Take this picture and go home. Keep it nicely You have my phone number? Call me when you have any news. This is all the money I have. I have nothing to do with that matter at all Lung, wait Give me the picture. Don't you? Hey Detective. You are buying me a dinner. You have the money now! T alk less and just order your food. I'll pay the bill. (in Thai) hey, give him a bowl of dumplings and a dark coffee Sure Give this back to you This is good! You got a job now? I'll call you if I need help Great. Pay back more if you can. I need money for the New Year You're just kidding. I think you get enough under table Not really. We watch over China Town only. Not as gainful as elsewhere Why don't you work with me? I guarantee you a raise A raise? Work with you? You're damn broke What do you want me to do? Catch a cheating spouse again? I can't tell you now. It's called code of ethics Let see how long you can hold Excuse me, do you know this lady? Who are you looking for? Let me see Oh, is this Sum? This picture was taken at my place. See, this guy playing mahjong is Ming. Why are you looking for her? We were friends but we haven't seen each other for a long time. I want to find her now. I just came back from The States How come you have this picture? Well, she sent me this picture long time ago. But I lost her address... I haven't seen her for a while. She hasn't come to mahjong 2 weeks or so Maybe she goes on vacation with Ming Don't let Ming know your woman. That bastard keeps chasing every girl Cut the crap. I just played mahjong here with Ming a few days ago Does anyone know where Sum lives? I know.She lives nearby. Do you know Siu Siu Restaurant? She lives across the restaurant Great.Thank you. Boss You're welcome. Just call me Uncle Cheung is fine Nice to meet you. I am Tam Take a picture! Are you looking for Sum? -Yes -Who are you? I am her friend I think she moved already Right, I haven't seen her for a long time Do you know where she moved? No That's bad! Would you mind give me a call if she comes back? You two look alike. Are you sisters? No Do you live upstairs? I live on 5 Going to the market now? Yes Just go for a walk. The weather is good Thank you You're welcome This person looks honest.Yes I think I saw him in the market a few days ago Really? That's strange Tam Sum is not home, right? Yes Ming has another place.Try again. What? This is the address. I don't want them always bother Ming. I have enough of that woman! hey, did you move the body? You know this dead man, Ming, right? I don't know him. I was just looking for him on behalf of my client Okay.You said when you came in the door was half closed, and when you came up, did you bump into someone on the stairs? yes, I think that person killed Ming and tried to leave in a hurry Don't tell me you're a detective. Did you hear what the coroner said? He said the man died one or two days ago. No suspicious cause of death. Judging from the scene it could be a suicide Somehow I feel something is not right You look something is not right on you (in Thai) Sir, I found a phone under the pillow (in Thai) on the bed in the room Wow, this guy had a lot of women Can I have a look? Take a look if your woman is there? Can you send the picture to my phone? I have my code of ethics Should I delete the pictures before I give this phone back to his wife? You can do your investigation. But don't do it so openly. Many of these women are married May be one of the husbands discovered the affair and got someone to kill him You come to buy me a dinner? Not a problem. Can you tell me anything about your progress in Ming's case That guy was extremely popular among women. Those women knew he was married but still kept running around him Don't tell me something I can read from the newspaper. I want to know the inquest report The inquest report said there were only wounds caused by hanging. No other sign of fatal injuries What does that mean? This means the man killed himself. As I said, I can tell from the scene that it was suicide I met someone hurrying down the stairs. And the door was half closed. How can you explain these? We checked the door but there was no sign of breaking in. Maybe the deceased did not close the door properly when he killed himself I don't think the person you met is the killer. The coroner said the deceased was dead for at least two days Maybe that person wanted to come back to check if Ming was dead for sure Good imagination! Did you find out why Ming killed himself? Y es, his wife said he lost a lot of money in the stock market. He committed suicide due to a relationship. Hmm... I still feel that his death is not that simple. So, the case is closed? What else do you want? We've done our investigation and there is nothing suspicious. We are very busy. Not like you boring enough to investigate for nothing... Detective If I am not seriously shortsighted I am already a police officer. I could be your boss too. If Ming was murdered, then the killer was an expert. An expert killer... who makes a murder look like a suicide What are you thinking? Take it easy Oh well, let see if someone is smarter than me... hey,you said you'd buy me a dinner Are you Ming's wife? Yes, and you are? I am Detective Chan I've already told your colleague everything I know I have some more questions. Did your husband invest in the stock market with other people? Did he have any argument with anyone recently? I think he invested together with somebody With who? I'm not sure. I never asked him about these. But I heard him talking in the phone and said something like if the stocks kept falling, it'd be big trouble Can you show me the letters that your husband received recently? Sure Are there any statements or letters about the stock investments? I don't think so Any debt collector came to your house? No Did your husband give you anything recently? Y es What is it? He gave me some money Please do me a favor, don't pretend to be a cop ever again. I can't help you if anything happens How do you know I'd go to Ming's house? We grow up together. I can read your mind You said Ming killed himself because he lost a lot of money in the stock market. But his wife said he gave her some money before he died. So this reason is invalid. If you said he killed himself because of a relationship, it's even more ridiculous. You think this kind of person will kill himself for love? I am not as imaginative as you. I just follow the evidence. If the cause of death is not suspicious I will not make assumptions Chak, it's him. I met him on the stairs (in Thai) We are police officers. We need to use your car Be careful. What do you thinking you are doing? Don't mess around That guy ran away when he saw me Something is wrong with him Watch out! Watch out!Watch out! Watch out! Shut up, Calm down (in Thai) Damn it! The elephant is dead? An elephant can't survive a crash like this! Uncle Cheung Oh, it's you Did you find Sum? No. I come here to see if she ever comes again. No How much do you know about Ming? Do you know any other women are close to him? He just liked flirting with women and was not a bad person afterall I heard that he had a lot of affairs. But what I saw personally was just Sum and him. They were not shy about their relationship Hey, it's your turn Uncle Cheung, I'm leaving now You are leaving early today Thank you Why are you following me? I know to know more about Ming We are not close friends. I know nothing You are not close friends? I saw an intimate picture of you and him in his phone. Please, don't tell anyone. If my husband knows about this, I'll be dead. Do you want money? No, I just want... Hey, don't misunderstand. I just want to know more about what happened on Ming Actually I don't know too much. About two weeks ago he called me and wanted to borrow some money to repay his stock margin. That's the first time I know about his stock investment. But the amount was big. I didn't have the money Do you know if he bought stock with someone else? How would I know? I don't know his friends. But I wrote him a cheque to repay bank interest once. He asked me to give the cheque to a bank teller called Poon So Fong. He said he invested with her together Do you know this bank teller? Y es. I put money in that bank too Any picture of her? I know he has a lot of women. But I never think it is really that many This is she Do you know where she lives? No, I don't know much about her Hello, Chan's Private Detective Tam, this is Wing You need to help me Wing? Help you? Who are you? I... Someone wants to kill me!! Hey, Big Head can you help me trace the previous call? Where was it from? What? You want me to help you trace a call? Do you know how much you still owe me? Pay me first! Hello, this time is a matter of life and death. You must help me one more time I will pay you back for sure Alright! I trust you this time What are you doing? Why did you go there? Someone called me and asked me to help him. But he hung up before telling me what happened. Something was not right so I traced the call. I found his address and went there to see what's going on. But when I rang the door bell, the explosion blast off. He said in the phone that he was Wing, and he said someone wanted to kill him. I don't know who he was. Do you think he was murdered? You really have a craving for crime investigation. You think every case is murder, right? But this time... you could be right. His name was Wing, a stockbroker. We checked the scene and his death looked suspicious. Initial examination found many stab wounds on his body. The cause of explosion could be a leakage of gas in the kitchen, probably because of the overflowing congee in the cooking pan. You rang the doorbell and triggered the explosion. He couldn't survive anyways. Whether the stab wounds or the explosion killed him, we'll find out soon An elephant can't survive a crash like this Anyone was there besides Wing? No Where do you want to go? I want to go back to the explosion scene Damn it! I have to warn you! I warn you not to investigate anymore. You really think you are a professional detective? Then why can't you find your parents after all these years Please don't do anymore investigation! (in Thai) Have you seen my mom and dad? (in Thai) They didn't come home for a few days already (in Thai) Your parents are missing. Maybe they are dead. How may I help you? Is Miss Poon So Fong working here? Poon So Fong. I'm sorry. She took a day off today Can you tell me where she lives? I'm sorry that we cannot tell you I know. But I am.... What's the matter? Manager, this gentleman wants to have Fong's address I'm sorry that we cannot disclose our staff's information I understand. I am Detective Chan. This situation is like this. A few days ago there was an accident and An old lady was run over by a taxi that old lady was badly injured. She just asked us to come here to look for Miss Poon. So I need to tell Miss Poon to go to the hospital urgently Hello, May I ask if Miss Poon So Fong lives here? Yes.Are you looking for her? Mom, someone wants to see you. Come in Please have a seat Mom, someone wants to see you. Maybe she is asleep Is your mom sick? I am not sure. This morning she didn't get up to make breakfast for me. When I came back from school I didn't see her come out either Did your teacher penalize you and make you write this? No, Mom asked me to write for her Why did she ask you to do this? She said she did something wrong and got penalized Did she say what she'd done wrong? Yes, she said she killed someone! Don't touch those things. Don't tell me you come here to investigate but you don't know the deceased You have to believe me. I really don't know her. I came here because I found that she purchased stocks with Ming I investigated the man you said who killed Ming. He is a professional burglar. He just stole a car on the day he met us You want to say this lady was murdered, right? Don't be silly. You already found that she purchased stocks with Ming. It is possible that she killed herself because she lost too much money What do those words on the wall mean? I haven't finished. It is also possible that, like her son said, she killed someone so she killed herself because she was afraid of punishment If she killed someone, who did she kill? Maybe she killed... Wing? You don't have to worry. We will investigate.Okay? (in Thai) Sir, I find a box. Fong is so silly. If she owed the bank money, she could repay slowly. That day Fong opened a margin account with Ming and another person called Choi. The correspondence address is Choi's How much money did they lose? About a million. But they repaid the debt recently. I'm not sure if they have other debts elsewhere Are you looking for someone? Y es, is Choi living here? Yes, are you a debt collector as well? No, I am his friend. A lot of debt collectors come to him? Quite a lot a while ago. But not recently. Last night I heard him arguing with a woman. He said something like he was not involved, why should he repay etc He is back Someone wants to see you. He is at the door Who is that? Lung? Who are you? Detective Chan Detective Chan? What brings you here? Come in. Come in Are you okay? When did you come in? You opened the door and let me in. Wake up. Do you remember you asked me to investigate a woman for you? I asked you to investigate A woman? What woman? I'm in trouble. Someone wants to kill me I know. This one Lung, Are you crazy!? Look at yourself. You are like the God of Death. Whoever you find will die.Three were dead in just a couple of days You came out from hospital then you went to do your investigation. Why don't you go home and take a rest instead? Now you've made a mess. Who is this man Choi? Why did you look for him? I can't even believe myself. This man was the person who invested together with Ming and Fong. What's more, he was Lung, who hired me to investigate a woman for him You don't even know who hired you to do a job? I met him in the bar. Everyone in the bar called him Lung. So I only know him as Lung. He was a butcher in the market. I don't know his real name Okay, now you tell me that, Choi jumped off the building right? Did he jump himself, or did someone push him? If you say he was murdered, I'll arrest you now, because there were only you and him on the roof. What did Choi ask you to investigate? He came to me and took out a woman's picture. He said the woman followed him all day and wanted to kill him. He asked me to find out the woman This is she. Everyone calls her Sum. She was very close to Ming If you could find her, the case is closed. That's it. Then why do you still have to investigate the cause of death of Ming? Ming and Fong are found to have killed themselves. Why do you go to see Choi? I just know where she lives. I haven't seen the woman in the picture yet. I feel that this woman is not that simple. Maybe she is the expert killer that I mentioned. I can't find her. Can you help me to investigate? You want me to beat you up? Calm down! She could be related to the deaths of Ming, Fong and Lung, because Lung said she wanted to kill him Detective Do you have a delusion? You said when Choi came to you he looked like he was drunk! Can you treat this as a missing person case and investigate? Sure,but no one comes to report a missing person case. You take care of yourself first, please What's wrong with me? Do you know you are the prime suspect in pushing Choi down the building? Sign here. Go home I want to report a case. My friend is missing Lunatic!! Are you looking for me Who are you? I am Sum Uncle Cheung! Oh, is you! Why is it so quiet today? Something evil is going on. I have four mahjong friends died in a row. Everyone is scared and won't come to play anymore Four mahjong friends died in a row? Yes, Ming, Fong, Hung and Lung. Too many deaths Uncle Cheung, what kinds of people come here to play mahjong? Could be anyone. Most of them are neighbours. Some come from other places Did Sum come recently? If she comes I'll certainly let you know What? Nothing, I am just curious Ming, Fong, Lung were partners. Then, how did Wing relate to them? There was an explosion in Wing's house. Does that mean... What the heck? Why do you come here? Let me tell you, this is a murder scene. We have confirmed that Wing was stabbed to death. The killer could be Fong, because we found Wing's skin debris in Fong's fingernails. I have also checked on the woman you asked me to investigate. Her name is Mok Wai Sum. She has no family or relatives. She has some money. No record of leaving this country Could it be possible that Fong did not kill Wing? Maybe both of them, and Ming were all killed by Sum. It is possible because Lung said Sum wanted to kill him Your client Lung is dead. Why do you still want to investigate this woman? Listen, I won't investigate Sum anymore. Are you clear? I am warning you Then why do you come here? Do you want me to drag you away? (What happen today is not an accident Stop it) Ming, Fong, Lung, Wing, Sum They all killed themselves because they lost a lot of money. But all of them left some money behind Wing was a stockbroker. He was murdered Both Fong and Sum had affairs with Ming Sum did not leave the country Lung came on July 1 3 and said that Sum followed him and wanted to kill him. Wing called me for help. There was a woman's voice in the phone A neighbour heard Lung argued with a woman the night before his death Is the woman who talked with Lung and Wing the same person? Ming, Fong, Lung, Sum, Wing were all mahjong friend at Uncle Cheung's grocery store. They probably know each other. But then why did Lung said he did not know Sum? Who is the man with eyes only in the photo? Hello, Detective Chan I just passed by Sum's house. I heard someone inside. I think Sum is back Oh, thank you Wait. I heard a man's voice inside.... It's not your business. It's dangerous. Go home first. I'm coming over now What? It's dangerous? Then you'd better come quickly! (Sum withdrew $3 million) (from her bank account on July 1 and 2) How may I help you? I want to see Manager Chan. I met him last time He is on leave today. How may I help you? I want to ask about your bank's procedures if someone wants to withdraw large amount of cash Okay. Maybe our Assistant Manager could help. Please wait Okay, thank you Please come with me Let's say a customer normally writes cheques about a hundred thousand, but suddenly writes a cheuqe of hundreds of thousands or even millions, in order to protect the customer, we'll call the customer for verification If we cannot get in touch with the customer, we will verify the customer's signature at least by two staff. We will cash the cheque only if we are able to confirm without doubt Mr. Chan, what do you need this information for? I just want to know more about how your bank handles cheques Excuse me. Hello, Chak? I'm busy at this moment. Can I call you back? Okay, I am really busy. I'll call you back It won't take long alright Still got things to do The man with eyes only is the Assistant Manager Hung. That means he is related to all these deaths I just need to follow him and could probably find an answer to all these mysteries. No matter he is the next person who kills himself, or the next victim, or even the killer, I think I can find an answer from him If he is the next victim, I can find the killer by following him The mysterious person could be the killer. I am in danger as well Thank you I'll let you know if I have something good Keep in touch I am Detective Chan from the Commercial Crime Investigation Team. I need some information about the man who handed in the cheque I know his name is Kwong Chi Hung. Can I have his recent stock transaction records? I'm not sure about his past records His transaction record was kept by one of our colleagues. But he passed away a few days ago What was his name? Kwan Sai Wing (in Thai) What are you looking at? Who are you looking for? (in Thai) Get out, get out! Why are you following me? I know that you are not a cop. Please don't follow me anymore (Ming, Fong, Lung, Wing, ) (Man with eyes only - Hung, Sum, ) (Mysterious person= A lady with long hair=Sum) Hello, Chak Hello, where are you? That woman is the killer! Huh!Are you playing another game? I am playing the game of life. I can't tell you the details now. Send someone to save me. Hurry up! You survived! Hurry up! It is so stinky here! Bear with it You bear with it! Hurry up! (in Thai) Turn on the lights Don't say I am not telling you.... The body is confirmed to be Sum. The body is confirmed to be Sum. But we also found a pair of skeletons in the same scene. We are waiting for the inquest report to see if they are related. Now the prime suspect is, the man with eyes only in the picture Don't worry. It's okay. I'll call you later Mr. Kwong Chi Hung, this is Detective Chak from Homicide Department. I'll call you back later We believe you are connected with a murder. Please come with us Clean up the mess Lung, work harder! After you clean up the mess don't touch other things in the room. I fake her signature and work with Fong to take her money. Then we all have money to repay the debt Chak Let him go. Let him go Don't come over Stop it. Stop. Let him go. Let him go Stop it. Stop. Let him go If I know this, I should have killed you with the freezer (in Thai) Don't move. Everyone don't move I'll shoot if you say one more word T am, don't move. Calm down. We can talk. Let him go. Tam. Don't move. Don't shot. Call the ambulance. Hurry up Are you crazy? You asked me not to move. What if you shot me? He had a gun in his hand It's a fake gun. I used it to scare him Then you go to see him My gun is real Don't point it to me You bastard.You are pretending to be a cop again? Play with a fake gun Play with it Is he dead? Is he dead? He's dead not you You'll regret sooner or later. How do I know it's a fake gun? You said I am crazy. I think you are crazy Did I do something wrong? Why do you call me so urgently? Remember the pair of skeletons we found? We confirmed they are not related to Hung's case Really? That means there is another big case? The inquests report shows that they belong to a man and a woman. Both were killed more than 30 years ago Oh my god! A murder case thirty years ago? A man and a woman? More than 30 years ago? Could it be... We need to do more examination first. It is possible, right? You don't have to comfort me. So many years have come and gone. I think they were already... Nevermind... Iet's eat... (in Thai)Lemon tea and toast please In hindsight if you are not so involved in the investigation and take a suicide case as a murder case we can't find out that this Beijing girl was murdered You're right it looks like the whole incident is pre-determined by the unknown Almighty When Lung came to my place the other day I already felt that something was wrong What do you think... did Ming and Lung kill themselves, just like Fong Because they were afraid of punishment? What I heard from my dad is strange things always happen when you investigate this kind of case Let's talk about you Why did you go to that stinky ditch? I found Sum and because of her, I found the two of them She wants to kill me I think I just saw Sum She wants to kill me
