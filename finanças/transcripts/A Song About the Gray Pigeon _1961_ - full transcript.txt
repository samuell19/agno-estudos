The Slovak Film Institute presents Story by: THE SONG OF THE GREY PIGEON Screenplay by: Editor: Music: Starring: Executive producer: Director of photography: Directed by: Film production and distribution BRATISLAVA - KOLIBA They call this an outing? It's just outside the village. I've been there a thousand times or more. We were to go to the ice cave! Doesn't it ever melt? - No. - What if there was a fire? Don't talk rot! Even in summer it's so freezing - your ears would drop off! Pity we didn't go there. The teacher's scared... I'll tell him you're shooting and you're not singing! Go on! I'll shoot your head off, hat and all! Telltale, chickenshit! Greet the priest! - Praised be the Lord! - Forever, Amen. - Laudetur. - In eternum. - On guard! - On guard! Are they biting, Father? You're scaring them all away. No peace even in the hills. Not nowadays, that's true. ...six, seven, eight... Germans. Messerschmitts. The partisans are causing trouble in the hills. I had to change the school outing. But it's quiet where we live. The Germans have secret weapons. London today. Moscow tomorrow... The Germans will win the war. They'll win and destroy everything! It's all in God's hands. The Germans, we... and the partisans. That fish, too. What about my Vincko, sir? He's not stupid, he'll finish school. But what then? He'll be a sexton like me. I'll teach him, free of charge. He seems suited to a job like that. Sir! Give me that catapult. And he's meant to be a sexton! Come on, children. And let's sing! He won't get the better of me. I've got another one. A better one. Now you can tell on me, Gustík! I will! This is our dear homeland. The beloved fatherland we inherited. Our valleys, villages, our poor, but God-fearing nation. Hungarians to the south... The Poles there... bad neighbours. And godless Bolsheviks pushing from the east. But we're not afraid. We've a powerful German empire to the west led by Adolf Hitler. Be sure to remember that name. Let's follow it! Vincko, don't! Get lost! Get lost, or I'll cut your plait off! He hit it! - That was you? - Me. Do you know what you hit? No, I don't. - Looks like... a pigeon. - A wild pigeon. You must be a good shot to hit that. I can hit anything. Even a beetle. What did he say? He's a better shot than you are. Says he can hit a beetle. Pity, we haven't got a beetle. - Wait... can you hit this? - Yes, I can. Then try! Stupid rock. Try again. No! I'll try this time, okay? Go on! How's that? Nothing? No! When did you last try? Thirty years ago. Throw up a rouble and I'd shoot it into kopeks. What are you crying for? He hit it, it won't fly any more. Show me! Take it home. it'll heal, you'll see, it'll fly again. Ask your father to help you. You must bandage its wing. Look, here and here. Get it? Here you are. - Father won't help me! - Why not? He hasn't got a father. They shut him up. A prisoner. - Why? - For a song. Dad sung it with his mates. What song? One... for May Day. Don't worry, your father will soon be back. So, the school year's over. In the holidays, don't forget what I told you. Let's cherish our freedom, protect it from enemies, always be on guard! - Where've you been? - In the forest, sir. Without permission. What were you doing there? - Looking for a drink of water. - They were catching birds, sir! - Did you torture it? - No, I didn't. - You're lying! - He isn't. It wasn't him who caught it, sir. - Then who? - Me. Okay. I'll punish you all. Cut a cane! Strip it! Your hand! The other! The other! Didn't you hear? The other! Open your hand. Did you hear? Come on! You. you... I'll teach you!! Look out! - Why've they come here? - For the procession. With guns? - They've come for the partisans. - Do the partisans know? - No, they don't. - Then I'll tell them. You? I can run like a rabbit, keep going like a horse. You can't go faster than a car. A military one at that! I'm going. I'll take the pigeon. What for? - Okay, then. - Well, goodbye, Martin. - Where are you off to? - Shit! I'll tell! Unfortunately, the partisans are causing trouble in our hills, too. Men disappear from our village and don't come back. Fires are burning at night, they're dropping parachutists. It's time the army chased the bandits. I hope your Guardists will help if necessary. Yes. We must keep law and order. Exactly how many men? Three, plus me as commander. The ones carrying the baldachin. Hope they don't overdo it. Four Guardists, is that all? Four, but reliable! I'll mention that in Bratislava. Consider our talk strictly confidential. What if the soldiers overtake Rudko? We must warn the partisans. How? That's difficult! We'll fire the mortar! We'll ring the bells to raise the alarm! Ring unconsecrated bells...? Never! Where are you running to, lad? To... to pick strawberries. We'll give you a lift. A procession in the village and you're picking strawberries? That's a sin. I'll confess. - What've you got in that box? - A wild pigeon. Sell it! We'll make soup. It's not for sale. I want to let it go in the forest. Aren't you afraid of partisans? There aren't any here. There are partisans everywhere. Maybe there were, but they've gone. How do you know? People say so. Well, we'll see. Over our heads there is a bell. Not yet consecrated... So you won't ring it? I can't. You must see that. Father would... Our nation has never enjoyed such wonderful freedom. And the partisans? You're a weakling if you don't! ...to ring out for us in hard times. To ring out the alarm! The village is on fire! You're wasting your time going there, sir! There are no partisans here! And what's that? Don't shoot! Why would I shoot? They're ours. And I can see you're ours, too! Fly, pigeon! Fly home! Don't be afraid, fly! You know me? Don't you know me?! Daddy! You've been away a long time. Yes. How's things at home? Mummy cried a lot. We didn't hear from you. I couldn't let you know. They put us in a labour camp. But I escaped with one other man. It's wounded. It needs its wing bandaged better. Don't worry, they're not real solders. Message from Rudolf Hrudka They're not real soldiers. People needn't know that. And soldiers has an "i" in it. That everyone should know. Show me. We'll see to the pigeon. I'll stay with you, Daddy. - Well... Rudko... - Daddy! Give my love to Mummy! You must go back, there should be a man at home. Yes. This is the Free Slovak Radio Banská Bystrica. Today our army and partisan units made a well-prepared artillery attack on German positions. After heavy fighting our units are advancing. The situation in the northern part is still serious. The German command is deploying new units, mainly SS troops. They include the Dirlewanger, Adolf Hitler and Wiking SS divisions. These divisions have already met our units. Our dad is there too. The Germans are like cockroaches. Don't worry! Ours are better soldiers! And when the Russians come, they'll easily beat them up! If there were... a real gun. Wouldn't you be scared to shoot? The enemy has suffered grave losses and has had to retreat. Heavy fighting has continued today as well. - Will we be here for the night? - It looks like it. I'll have a look around. - Keep an eye on our things. - Yes, Dad. What's this village called? Jasenová. - Pretty village. - What's pretty about it? I can see there's been fighting here. What do you know about it. We're going to the uprising, too. All the way to Banská Bystrica. - The uprising is all around! - But that's the heart of the uprising. Blathering! And sitting in a car as if he could drive! - I can drive! - You can't! Dad taught me. Then show us! I can't. We've run out of petrol. He can't... he's just boasting! Boaster! He doesn't know how to! Okay. You can drive a bit. And can you do this? You've got a steady hand. You'd be good at firing a gun. Really? - What's your name? - Milan. And yours? Vinco. And these are my mates. And what's that? Skates. With wheels too! - Skates on a cart, you know? - I know. You can skate on these whenever you want. But you can't here. There's no asphalt. In town you can fly like the devil! You could here too! Goodness, just like on ice! And you flew like an angel! - Will you lend me them? - Yes! - And me? - All of you. - Who's going first? - Me! - Me! - Me! I'm the sexton's son. Like on ice, boys! Just wait! I'll cut it off! He's better at it than I am. I'll show you a pigeon... a wild one! Your father's got a lovely rifle! He's an officer, a major. Look! When he gets to Bystrica, he'll be a lieutenant colonel. - Lieutenant colonel? - Or lieutenant. - And what's that? - Medals! These are legionary ones. Medals for bravery, for heroism. My father isn't afraid of Guardists, nor Germans. No one. Come on, so my father doesn't have to look for me. MILAN FROM TOWN - Blessed be the Lord! - For ever, Amen. Blessed be the Lord! Have you been praying? Praying, Father. We need to... in this godless age. And where are you going, boy? To Jelenec, to see the forester. - He wants to borrow a rifle. - A rifle? What for? For the enemy, lieutenant! That's not for you. You must learn, study... There's no school now. There's no school now. Why? A Guardist, lieutenant. Rat! Call me major. I'm not a lieutenant yet. Are you holding out, lads? We are, sir! Sorry, Major! All in order, Major! I'm in a hurry. I'm going to join the uprising. - The road to Bystrica? - Clear, Major! To the uprising by car. Well, I'll be damned! Bedding and all. Well, lad, you're here. Yes, Lieutenant. Thank you... and good journey! Milan, take care, goodbye! Goodbye, Vinco! Germans! Run! Milan, run! A German... Don't move! Shoot, Lieutenant! Dad! - Hitler! - No, a Guardist! Are you Hitler or a Guardist, sir? A man of a thousand faces, Fero Šlosiarik. Driver, actor, critic and conjuror. Partisan, singer and comedian. Now I'm playing Hitler. And I'll gobble you all up! Wait here! I'm going for some salt! Why's he waving his arms like that? He's Hitler, can't you see? Come on, now! A car with ammunition's got stuck, we must get it to the front. Now? - Got enough diesel? - Yes. I must finish Hitler. Damn Hitler! This is urgent! - Let's go to the front! - Let's! What am I, an artist or a deliveryman? Take us with you! - Where do you want to go? - To the front. The front? After the war, they're shooting there now. THEATRE OF THE FRONT FERO ŠLOSIARIK -1000 FACES Ow! You won't get anywhere with that, mate! What about the munitions? How much have you got? - Three tons. - How much?! Three tons. What are you doing here? I came to help you. Help? Then get on with it! So much ammo just for one war. Madness! That rifle, would you lend it me, sir? What for? You've got your catapult! You can't shoot anything with that. That's what's best about it. That's it. What are you waiting for? Go home! You'll have to unload it. What am I going to do with you? They take them that young? What luxury! Not even a general rides like this to the front! They should give us a performance too. What kind of theatre could be in an old crock like this? What old crock? This is the National Theatre on wheels. Just wait. The Germans will perform for you. What's that? A Guardist's hat. On guard! Throw that get-up away! Stop that! I play Hitler in that. Stop that! I play Hitler in that. Nowadays there are plenty of hats like that around! - But no Guardists! - Where are they? Gone to hell. Who knows... Crawled into holes like rats. They're waiting for the Germans. Not all of them. Some have opened their eyes. Who knows what a Guardist sees when his eyes are open. That it was stupid. I was in the Hlinka Guard too. You were in the Guard? That's a big leap from the Guard to the uprising. You have to have a thick skin for that! What d'you know? No one forced you to. But I had to. It was a question of a living! Either - or. It's always either - or. Either you're a man - or a bastard. But I'm here now! I'm fighting along with you! So what else do you want? - They're bringing it! - Ammunition! - They're bringing ammo! - They're coming! - You... wait! - Me? Why? You can help unload the ammo. Quick, so the Germans don't... Lie down! Get down! Sir! That gun... you can... You can... Quick! Get some water! Run, sonny! The Germans are coming! Water... sir... Sir! Sir... It was you shooting? BEWARE! PARTISANS! - How do you feel, Verona? - All right, Matúš. - Aren't you cold? - No, I'm all right. Hold on! We'll soon be home. - Can we go? - Yes, we can, Natasha. Don't be angry with me for coming looking for you. I'm not any more. I was scared alone at home. - And you in the hills... - You won't be alone now. We're home? Home... home... Why've we stopped? Just lie still! There now, Veronka! Why've we stopped? Good God! Don't cry! Don't think of anything! Think of our child. Don't worry, we'll go to the village for help. If it's a girl, we'll name it after you, Veronka. Swine! I prepared everything. Cradle, bedclothes... I sewed little shirts, and bonnets... All burnt. Don't think about it, shut your eyes and imagine something nice. Do you want a boy or a girl? Matúš wants a girl. Kosťa wanted a girl, too. Kosťa wanted a girl, too. - Are you married? - No, Kosťa was my first love. We were seventeen. Maybe we would have married, but for the war... Listen, Germans! Don't shoot, it's me! It's me! What? Have you escaped from a circus? You're a Russian! Yes. And you're a bear? We're taking round the nativity. Here. You too. And Rudko? He should be here! What've you got there? - I'm going for water. - What for? Mrs Hanúska's going to have a baby. - Let's go and have a look! - Wait! We've got to get wood. - Come on! - Let's go then! Do you know how children are born? I can imagine. - Have you ever seen a stork? - What's a stork? A big bird that stands on one leg. And brings children. You think storks bring children? And who brought you? - Mama. - Mama? And your mother brought you, she gave birth to you. Me, too? Everyone's mother. Even such great people as... Chapayev, Garibaldi, Gorki... They were all born. And who's Gorki? Gorki was a great man. And the others? They were great people too. They, too, fought for a better life. - Are you a great person too? - Me? No. I'm an ordinary Soviet girl. Are you a woman? Yes, a woman, a girl. Don't you believe me? - What's your name? - Natasha. You're lying! You're not a woman! Women don't wear hair like that. I used to have beautiful long hair. But the Germans caught me. The Germans caught you? They wanted to shoot me. But I escaped. NATASHA What did you write? Do you know Cyrillic? Never mind, you'll learn. Then you'll read it and understand. I'll write to you, but after the war. I'll send you a letter. I've written down your name. If I write someone's name down, I'll write to them. To Milan, and one officer, Fero, who has a thousand faces... You'll need a lot of money for that. A lot of money. Nothing at all. How come? I've got a wild pigeon. But he's still sick. His wing hurts him. When he gets well, I'll teach him. He'll be a carrier pigeon. He'll carry my letters, you see? I see. I need a pencil like that. Sell me it. - I can't. - I'll give you three crowns. Don't beg, I can't. I was given it to remind me of someone. Come nearer, I'll show you something. Look! - Can you see? - I can see a tower. The Kremlin... that's Moscow. After the war you'll come and stay and we'll go sightseeing. Germans! Over there... What's that? One of our heroic deeds! There's sure to be someone there! There'll be partisans there! We must go and have a look! Partisans? Well, good night, holy night... Fine partisans! We're not partisans! We're taking round the Nativity. Quiet! Shh! For heaven's sake, go away! And you? Don't worry about me. Go away, dear! Be quiet, Verona. Go! They'll shoot you! Do you hear? May God give us happiness! Please, Lord! I'm Kubo, Kubo. I bought a warm coat for a flask of wine and a pint of beer. Oh, look, look, dear sirs! Tempo... master singer. That little one is quite big. Go on, go on! Good God! What is that? Quiet! Bring some water! Wasser! Of course! A partisan? How many are there? What's the matter with him? No idea. Come on then. Come out! Hurry up! Wait. Will it be a boy or a girl? Sing! Sing! Here you are. It's time to go. Come on then! Sing! Do you hear me? Sing! They'll shoot her. They won't. She'll escape again. She's already escaped once. Sir! Where are you going, sir? Hello, Rudolf! Vincko! You're a soldier? Our teacher's there! He won't be teaching any more. You've taken him prisoner? We've taken all of them. Did you fight too? We were under fire all the time. You're a great man! And you've got a horse... And badges. Do you want them? Vincko, you can't cut my plait off now. It was burnt off, when they burnt our house down. And I've got a pencil with an eye from Natasha. Where are you going now? Now? That's a military secret. I must be going. Take care. And send my love to my family! MY FRIEND VINCENT Mama, look! A Russian partisan. Števko dear! You didn't cry the whole war and now? What do you know? It's over now. I know. Daddy! You look like a Russian partisan. Only the papakha's Russian. What's a papakha? A fur hat... in Russian. You know Russian? This... Man - that sounds proud. What's that? Natasha, a Russian partisan wrote that for me. Man, that sounds proud! It can fly already! It can fly, boys! The pigeon has recovered! MINES We must go back. Then where can we release the pigeon? It's forbidden. There are mines there! We'll go off the path. No one will see us. - I'm not afraid. - Then let's go! Don't go! You can let it go somewhere else! It won't explode now, the war's over. We caught it here, we must let it go here. Rudko, don't go! Are you scared? Wait for me! You see, and you were afraid! Will you obey me? That's our village. You'll fly there and land on our chimney. Don't fly off into the woods! What will you do with it then? It'll deliver my letters. Will you train it to be a postman? A carrier pigeon. It will fly all over the world. First it'll fly to Moscow, then to Prešov... to Bratislava and then to Bystrica. Fly, little pigeon! Don't be afraid! Wait for me! My pencil! Where's my pencil? THE END
