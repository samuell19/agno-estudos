(slow orchestral overture) (soft jazz music) - [Emma] Hi, Daddy. - Hi, darling. - Doesn't Mommy look terrific? - [Donald] Yeah, terrific. - You look terrific, too, Daddy. - Thank you, darling. We should be going. - [Jennifer] I'll be ready in a minute. (doorbell rings) - There's the car. Jennifer, I want to leave on time tonight. - You okay? - Sure I'm okay. - Hi, all set for the party? - Don't drip that stuff on the carpet. - Oh. - Did you finish your homework yet? (grunts) - [Michael] Have a nice time, Dad. - Thanks. - Well, what do you think? - Oh, Mommy, you look like a princess! - (laughs) No, no, darling, just Mrs. Prince. But thanks, anyway. - [Donald] Jennifer! - Oh, I better get down there, before your father murders me. Night, night. (soft romantic saxophone music) - Darling, relax. - I don't know why we give these things. - Because you want to. You're always telling me how important the Foundation is to you, and it is important. How else would those kids do their post-grad work? Now they've done it, tonight's the night we honor them. - Isn't it enough that I give them my money? And the company's? Do I have to thank them for taking it? - You know you enjoy it. Well, once you get going. And you always make a super speech. - Well, this is the last time. The last time. - Yes, darling. There's George. - How come wherever George is, he always makes you feel he owns the place? I bet he'd feel at home in the White House. - He says he does. - The perfect couple. - [Donald] Good evening, George. - Good evening. - How could he forget? They have that Foundation thing every year. - Joan, Don didn't forget. He was out of town, he got the dates confused. It happens. - Well, why did he send you? He could've called. - He asked me to drop a gift on the way to the dinner, and explain. He'll try to come by later. - Try? Oh, he'll try? He better come. - He'll do his best. He wants to see you, just be patient. - Patient, I am sick of being patient. It's been three years, Lee. I have waited for him three years. I'm still waiting. - Why don't you open his present? There's a note inside. - I love him, I really do. But I'm not waiting much longer, I can't. - Well, I have to get on over there. - Okay. But you tell him what I said. (slow orchestral dance music) - I'm gonna give you the good looking one. How are you? - [Jack] Hi. - Hi. - You having fun? - [Jennifer] Sure, Jack, sure. - Well, I am. - Diplomat. - [Jack] Lawyer, remember? - Isn't that the same thing? - Only sometimes. - Jack. - Catch you later. - You still have something to drink. - Oh, thanks, George. Well, everybody's having a good time. - Why now, it's the celebration of the Foundation's generosity, not theirs. - Cynic. - Realist. (background party chatter) Well, it's Professor Wohlstrom. - Oh, hello, George. - You remember Mrs. Prince, don't you? - Every year you ask me that, George. And every year I say, "Of course I do." Good evening, Jennifer. - [Jennifer] Hello, Eric. - [Eric] It's been another great year for the Foundation. - [George] Yes, indeed. (applause) - And I'd like to welcome, too, our eight new graduates, whose success in Marine Engineering and Biology, the Foundation is proud to acknowledge. In fact, one of them, Mr. Ben Forbes, starts work tomorrow for Prince Marine Industries. And we're darn lucky to get him. (applause) All right, I have here a check in the amount of, how much is it for? (laughter) $250,000, which I'm going to ask my wife, Jennifer, to give to the Foundation's treasurer, and our very good friend, Dr. Bob Symon. (applause) - Mr. Prince, one with your wife, please. - Sure. - You were terrific. - So were you. Listen, Jen, I'm really sorry, but something's come up suddenly. And Lee says that I have to go out and meet a guy. Hey, keep smiling, we're on Candid Camera. So I'll tell you all about it later, okay? You keep things going here, keep smiling, don't wait up. - (laughs) The Prince of Philanthropists and his Princess, oh, how do they write such stuff! Society columns. - Kay-- - Here are your muffins. - Oh, thank you, Sarah, yums! It is a good picture, though. You do look like a princess, don't you think? - Yeah, it's okay. Thank you, Sarah. Kay, I really wanna know. - Okay, okay. What do you want, little sister? - Advice, I want your advice. - Oh, honey, I don't know what to say. Advice from a family is seldom ever asked, and it's never taken. Particularly when it's over something like divorce. - Well, just tell me what you think. (trolley car bells ring) - She was the first of the line, the first main master. I designed and built her in an old garage 15 miles from the Bay. You know, I didn't know if she'd float, until I launched her. I don't know what I'd have done if she'd sunk. Gone into insurance, maybe? (laughing) - Well, one day, I'm gonna build a boat like that. Every bit of wood. - Yeah, well, I love to use wood, too. But it's tough to get the craftsmen, and fiberglass doesn't need looking after, the way wood does. - All right, Ben, I think maybe you should meet some of the others. - Oh, right. - I tell you what, I'll take you down to the small yard one day, where it all began. Introduce you to Dick Leonard. You talk about wood, Dick thinks that if boats were meant to be made of fiberglass, God would have made fiberglass trees. (laughing) He and I are building a 52-footer. My own design, well, it's a dream I've had ever since I was a kid. Well, it's nice having you with us, Ben. - Thank you, sir. - Oh, Lee, there are a couple of things, maybe Ben would wait outside? - Oh, of course, sir. - He's a nice boy, you know, he's enthusiastic. - Something on your mind? - Yeah. You know those complaints that we've been getting about the 500s. - Oh, I don't think they're anything to worry about. - I do, after all, I built this company's success on its ability to deliver classy boats. So I'm gonna go down and have a talk with Wells. - Don, you're always gonna get complaints for mass-produced units. - I want quality, Lee, all the time. And we talked about it before, this guy Wells needs a kick in the backside. Besides, it gives me a chance to talk to Dick, you know, about those designs for the 750s. He's complaining that we're just copying everybody else. - Well, what else is new, we copy them, they copy us. - With modifications. - Well, that's what I meant. Everything turn out okay last night? - Yeah, yeah, everything was great, thank you. - Well, I'll talk to you later. - Is there somebody else? - I don't know. I guess there must have been others. No one special, though. - Has he talked about divorce? - Are you kidding? Don would never be the one to bring it up. He'd be scared stiff, all that publicity. Think what it would do to his image. - Oh, Jennifer! Nobody cares about divorce in California. (laughs) It's one of the state's biggest growth industries. - No, if anyone brings it up, it has to be me. Really, Kay, Don would think a divorce would hold him back. - Oh, Jennifer! - You're right, it doesn't matter. But he wouldn't take the risk. He wants to go into politics. He's still very ambitious. Always was, wasn't he. - Yes, he was. Don't I remember. The two of you almost freezing to death in that awful old house. Listen, Don would keep warm just by burning ambition. I could never be married to a man like that. - It was wonderful then. We worked on everything together. I loved every moment. I want that feeling back. - And you think you get it back by divorcing? - Oh, Kay, I don't want to, honestly. - You ever thought that things aren't as bad as you make out? Talk to him, Jen, I mean, really talk to him. He may want to, and he can't. Oh, men are so stupid sometimes. Usually because they're so full of guilt. Oh Roger's impossible, it's always me that has to get the ball rolling again when things go wrong. - All right, I'll try. - Oh, good girl. And if there is a divorce, you find yourself the toughest lawyer you can. Don will. (soft orchestral music) - Hi, everything okay? Yeah, fine. Say, I'm going down to the yards tomorrow. Wanna come? - Are you kidding, what time? - [Donald] What time can you be ready? - Whenever. - Well, I'll pick you up at 9:30, okay? - [Joan] Okay. - And maybe we'll spend the night. - Oh, I'd like that, a lot. Don, did you talk to Jennifer yet? - Oh, no. - Oh, Don, you promised. - Yeah, I know, but maybe tonight. Hey, Joan. - [Joan] What? - I've got something for you, to go with the bracelet. - What is it? - [Donald] Wait and see. - Oh Don, I wanna know! - Tomorrow. - Hi, Sarah. - Hi, Mrs. Prince. - Did you put some ice in the den? - Sure did, Mr. Prince asked for it, the minute he got in. - He's here? - Right in there. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Anything good on? - It's the usual stuff, you know. There's a game on, later. - Would you like a drink? - No, yes, yes please, Scotch. - [Jennifer] Soda? - Yes, please. (jets roaring on television) Where are the kids? - Emma's sleeping over at Amy's. And Michael's at the movies with Jerry. You're home early. Cheers. - Well, I wanted to go over some things away from the phones. I'm going down to the yards tomorrow. I haven't been down there in awhile. - Oh, that's great! Dick'll be so pleased. Are you gonna talk to him about the boat? The Jennifer? Don, I'd like to come with you. - Well, yeah, sure, but not tomorrow. I've got a lot of business to get through, technical stuff, you'd be bored. - No, no, no I wouldn't. I understand most of it. I used to type it all out for you, correct your spelling, remember? - Oh yeah. But that was years ago, times have sure changed. There's been a technical revolution. - Well, then it's time I caught up. And Don, I'd love to see Dick again, and The Jennifer. (jets roaring on television) We could spend the night at the marina. - Jen, we have to talk. I mean, seriously. - I know, but not now. Tomorrow, away from here. - No, I think we should talk here-- - No, tomorrow. - Jen, if you'd listen to me-- - Tomorrow, I know there are things to talk about, Don. Tomorrow, we'll have all day. (soft sad violin music) (dramatic orchestral music) Where are we going first? - South yard, I want to talk to Wells. Then we'll go over to Dick's. - You know what I want, Don? - What's that? - You won't like it. (laughs) I want to go back to work, with the company. Don, look out! (automobile horn blaring) - I'm sorry. - I told you, you wouldn't like it. (laughs) Well, what do you think? - About what? - Us, working together again, like we used to. - Aw, Jen, we're a big company now. I mean, what the hell could you do? - I could find something, I'm not stupid. But I am bored. - Bored, what do you mean, bored? Look, you've got the kids, the house. All those committees, your girlfriends. How the hell can you be bored? - Just am, that's all. I want to go back to work. If not for the company, then I'll find something else. - No, I want you in the house, as a mother, and as a wife. - To be a wife, you need a husband. Someone who cares, someone you can talk to. Someone who comes home nights. - Look, if you don't like the way I am, maybe we should get a divorce. (machines roaring and grinding) - You can see, Mr. Prince, that they're hard at it. And they don't even know the boss is here (laughs). - That's not the problem, Mr. Wells. The problem is that you've let some sloppy work go out of here, how come? Those 500s have built a reputation for fine finish. It's what we sell them on. Outsell the competition, you know what I mean. - Well, the truth of the matter is, I was gone for a couple of weeks, and had a guy here who was making private deals with one of the suppliers. Of course, as soon as I found out about, I fired him. But, well, the damage was already done. - Okay, but if I get any more complaints. I have to use your phone. - Yes, sir, right this way. Right there. - Thank you, will you excuse me? - Yeah, you bet. - How can they work down there? The fumes are bad enough up here. - Well, you can't make fiberglass boats without making fiberglass fumes, just can't be done. (sea gulls crying) - We used to run one something like this, remember? A long time ago. - Well, there should be one down at the dock. Why don't you try it out? - How about you, you wanna come? What happened, Don? How did it get so bad you can't take the time to ride in a boat with me? We used to have fun, didn't we? We used to enjoy ourselves, we used to play, Don. Now we can't find the time. And what do we do, we get divorced. I'll take the boat over to Dick's. - Jen. I'm really sorry. Listen, when you get out on the marina, be sure to take a look back. That whole half on the right there belongs to us, you know. - Yes, I read that in last year's company report. But thanks for reminding me. I'll be sure and tell my lawyer. (sad violin music) (dramatic orchestral music) - Hi, Jennifer. - Hi, Dick. - [Dick] Come on. Achh! - You don't like it, right? - Right, darned egg-beater. If God meant there to be fiberglass boats-- - He would have grown fiberglass trees. You'll never change, will you? (laughs) I think it's beautiful. Well, it's fun, anyway. - Jennifer, I'll show you something beautiful. Come on. - The Jennifer? - Right. Tell me, is Don coming? - Later. - Oh. - You miss seeing him, don't you? - Yeah, yeah I guess I do. More than anything, I miss working with him. I got really excited when we started building The Jennifer. But hell, it's been going on for six months now, and we've hardly begun. Best boat designer I ever saw. But you know all about that. You saw everything he drew in the early days. Helped him sharpen his pencils. Jen, why did he have to go off and mass-produce those egg-beaters? - Money. Boats for the people. - Money, we're not exactly hurting here, you know. Although, I must admit, if he hadn't come back in with me when he did, I'd be out of business. His fiberglass saved my wood, and my skin, come on. Well, there's your boat, Jennifer. The beginnings of her, anyway. (telephone ringing) - How soon will she be finished? - Six or eight months, depends on Don. A lot needs talking over. - Dick! Dick! Telephone, Mr. Prince. - Excuse me. Don can't make it. He didn't say why. Just that he was sending a car for you to take you back to town. - Okay. Get out of that one, maestro. - Nice one. (clock chimes) Where's Dad? - Business meeting. He's having dinner at the marina. - Most business men don't work as late as Dad. I mean, none of the guys' fathers at school do. - Maybe that's because none of the guys' fathers are as successful as your father. - What's that supposed to mean? - Lee, it's Joan, listen something terrible has happened. You've got to come over right now. - I expect the president works late most nights. - But he still eats dinner with his family. - That's because the president can do anything he wants. And it's your move. - Yeah, well, I figured if I changed the subject, I'd have time to launch a brilliant counterattack. But, I surrender. - Oh, thank you, my son. - It's it okay if I watch TV now? - Sure. - Why didn't you stay down and have dinner with Dad, too? - I told you, it was a business meeting. - Oh yeah, I forgot. (siren wailing) - Would you try Dr. Symon again, please? Yeah. Hello, Bob, it's Lee Devlin. Don has had a heart attack. Yeah, I think, very. San Francisco General. No, I haven't called her yet, you go ahead. (dramatic orchestral music) Stay there. Don't make a move until I get back, you understand? - Lee, Don would want me with him. - Joan, just stay in the car. (monitor beeping) (car phone beeping) - Oh, shut up, shut. - You go past the elevator, and to the right. - [Voiceover] Dr. Kohl, please call the cath lab. Dr. Jerome Kohl, call the cath lab. - What can I do for you? Come on, miss, I don't have all night. - A friend of mine was brought in about an hour ago. He'd had a heart-- - Name? - Prince. - Initial. - D, it's Donald. - [Voiceover] X-ray technician on call, please call the emergency room. X-ray technician, call the emergency-- - Hey, Betty, Tom. Do you have a Don Prince up there? Young lady asking. I don't know, wait a minute. You Mrs. Prince, maybe? - No, Betty, just a friend. Okay, I'll tell her, thanks. Your friend's in intensive care. - Well, did they say how he was? - Well, like I said, he's in intensive care. Why don't you have some coffee? Come back in a half hour, I'll ask again. - Thank you. - [Voiceover] IV nurse to Four West, STAT. IV nurse to Four West, STAT. (elevator bell rings) Dr. Shaydell, please call the page operator. Dr. Oscar Shaydell, call the page operator. - [Jennifer] How is he, how bad is it? - I'm afraid it's not good. - [Jennifer] Where did it happen, when did it happen? - It was down at the marina, it was outside a restaurant. - Outside, how, Lee, how? - I'm not sure yet. - Where's Bob, did you call him? Bob, how is he? - I'm not gonna kid you, darling, it's touch and go. All I can say is, everything that can be done, is being done. - Bob. - Jennifer, I need to talk to Lee. - Okay. - I'll be back in a moment. - [Voiceover] Pharmacist on call, please go to CCU STAT. - Now, I want to know what happened. And no bull, I'm in no mood for it. - I wasn't there. - Who was? - A friend. - Who? Who, dammit! - A girl. She was in hysterics, and I phoned the ambulance and went straight over. - You know the girl? - Yes. - I see. You also knew he was using drugs? Amyl nitrate, him? - Yes. - Do you know where he got it? Where? - Well, I got it for him, sometimes. He needed to have a good time, now and then. - When will people learn, they go abusing their bodies without paying for it. - Well, you're his doctor, why didn't you tell him? - Until tonight, I didn't know he used it. If I had, I would have put a stop to it. What's more, if I had known who had been supplying him, I'd have called in the cops. Does that answer your question? Now, get the hell out of here, before I really get mad! Lee. Ask Jennifer to come in, would you? That is one very efficient young man. - Don says the business couldn't run without him. What are his chances, Bob? - Well, we'll all be a lot more optimistic if he gets through tonight. - Tonight! - Yep, after that, things should come easier. But I'm gonna need your help. - How? - He's gonna have to quit work. And I don't know for how long. - He won't like that. - He'll have to make a choice. Either a different style of life, or no life at all. - Oh, can I see him? - Yeah, come on. (somber orchestral music) - How did he seem? - He looked terrible, I couldn't believe it. - I'm sorry. Did Bob have any feel for how long it would take to get better again? - No, not really. But some time, why? - Well, I'm trying to think ahead, the company. - I thought the company was in great shape. - Oh, it is, but to the public, and the institutions, Don Prince is Prince Marine Industries. Stock's bound to go down. - What if he couldn't come back, if he couldn't work? - Well, we'd get by and wouldn't be the same, but we'd get by. - Who'd run the company, you? - That would depend on the board of directors, the shareholders. - "J", do you know who this belongs to, Lee? - No, oh, I guess that must be a friend of mine's. We were-- - A girl? - Yes, a girl. Thank you. (knocking) - Come in. - [Emma] Hi! - [Jennifer] Hi! - Can I have some? - Didn't Sarah give you your breakfast? - Yeah, but can I? - Okay. Oh, hi. - Hi, Mom. - Sleepyhead, sit down. - Did Daddy go already? - No, that's what I want to talk to you about. Oh, it's not serious. Your Dad's in the hospital. - Why? - Well, Dr. Symon says, he's had some sort of, well, sort of a heart attack. - When, where? - Last night at the marina. - Will he be all right? - He'll be fine. He just has to stay in the hospital for awhile until, until he's rested. - It's serious, isn't it. - Not if he does what the doctors tell him. And if he rests for a time, he'll be fine. - Yeah, but he won't wanna do that, will he, Mom? - Why, does he like going to the office better than going on a vacation? - Oh, sweetie, I don't know. But your Dad does like to stay busy. Now, don't you worry, he's gonna be fine. - Thank you for coming, Jack. - How's Don today? - Well, he had a good night, but Bob says we can't be optimistic, not yet. - How are the children taking it? - Quietly. - You said on the phone you'd like my advice. How can I help? - Well, there's so much, apart from Don's health. The children, the Foundation. Nothing must happen to the Foundation, Jack. I feel so helpless. I want to be doing something. - Let me say, first off, that you and the children have nothing to worry about. Financially, whatever happens. And, well, I'm sure the Foundation will continue as before. Processor Wohlstrom and then Bob will see to that. - And the company. That's what worries me, Jack. - [Jack] Can I ask why? - Last night, Lee said that Don is the company. Bob says when he gets better, he's going to have to quit work. For a long time. - I didn't know that. - Does that mean Lee will be taking over? - Well, he'd manage the company, but he does now. Don's given him a lot of authority. I know Lee can seem, well, cold at times, but he's good, Jennifer, loyal to Don. And he's got a terrific team backing him. Look, next Friday, come to lunch. The directors and the Foundation's trustees get together informally every two months, talk, have lunch. Please come. - Oh, I don't know, the boss's wife? - [Jack] You're entitled to be there. - I'd like to, but. - [Jack] Please. - All right. (TV sportscaster's running commentary) (knocking) - Come in. - [Lee] Hi. - Oh hi. Great, better every day. Hey, did you bring those contracts? - Yes, but don't worry, I've been over them. They are fine. - I told you, I want to see them. - Don-- - I want to see them, Lee, that's all there is to it. I feel like I'm in Alcatraz, here. - I think you're making a mistake. Bob Symon said you weren't to think about bus-- - Does Bob Symon pay your salary, or do I? - [Lee] But-- - No buts. I'm going nuts in here, just take a look around. The place looks like a florist's. Been here almost a week, and I feel fine. Oh, did you see Joan? - Yeah, she's fine. She wanted to come visit, I said, "Not yet." - Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right. But, you look after her, Lee. You give her whatever she wants, you know, money, anything. Because I'm gonna marry her, you know. No questions. So, is everything else okay? - Yeah, just fine. - Hi, good game? Hello, Lee. - Hello. - How you feeling? - Poor, I'm going crazy in here. There's such a lot to get done at the office. - Darling, you're just going to have to give it time. - [Donald] I haven't got it to give. - Don, darling, you have all the time in the world. But right now, you just have to take it easy. - Look, I feel fine. All I want to do is get out of here and get back to work. - Shouldn't you be going, Lee? - Yes, I was just-- - No, we still have a few things to discuss. - Well, I can wait, how long will it take? - Oh, what, a couple of hours? There's a lot to talk about, isn't there, Lee? - Well, yeah, yes, you see, Jennifer-- - Okay, I'll go, but not willingly or happily. I want you to know that this is against Bob Symon's orders. And if anything happens, Lee, I'll hold you responsible. - Well, you'll just have to tell him, Bob. I know you did, but he still has Lee in there. He just can't, or he won't, understand. No, no. He has to be told. He has to know. All right, thank you, bye-bye. (sighs) - Don, you're gonna have to take time off. A lot of time. Away from the business, away from everything. - Okay, how long, a month, six weeks? - Six months. At least, a year would be better. - Six months, what do you mean? Bob, I feel great, I feel terrific. - [Bob] Six months is a minimum. - I couldn't, what would I do? - You could go on a cruise with Jennifer. Anything, just as long as you get away. - I couldn't, Bob, I just couldn't. I mean, without my work, I'd die. - Don, with your work, you're gonna die. If you go on like this. - Die. (laughs) I, well. I just don't think I could do it, Bob. You see, it's my strength, more than anything. - Change isn't such a bad thing, my friend. You'd be surprised. - Let me think about it. - Don, Don, listen to me, please. I know the business needs you, I know that. But so do we, the children do. I do, too. If you took a year off, nine months might do. We could have fun, start again. It's the chance we need. Then, when you got back, I could help you with the business. We could work together, like we used to. We could have fun, couldn't we? - I don't think that that's possible, Jen. - But why? Why isn't it? It isn't that it's not possible, is it? It's that you won't try. That's it, Don, isn't it, you don't want to. - I don't know, I'm, I'm really not sure. Jennifer, I'm sorry. (sad orchestral music) - We're not late, are we? - Right on time. - Oh, I forgot my purse. I'm so nervous. - Oh, don't worry about it, it'll be fine. - Hi, Mrs. Prince, what a nice surprise. Hi, Jack. - Hello, Annie, nice to see you again. - Thank you. - You know everyone except-- - Excuse me, interrupting, Jack. But Bob just called from the hospital. They'd like Mrs. Prince to get back to him right away. - [Jennifer] What happened? - Why don't you make the call in Don's office, Jennifer. (intense violin music) - Annie, get Dr. Symon for Mrs. Prince, will you? General Hospital, yes. Put the call through here. Chin up. - Bob said he's not fighting? Don? I don't understand it. - Bob said the intensive care unit is working overtime. Don just wasn't responding. - We have to try it, right away. - Mrs. Prince is calling. - Do it. - [Specialist] Clear! - No, no no, please, I guess you all know how bad the news is, Bob says all we can do now is hope. - Is there anything you'd like, Jennifer? Coffee's on the way. - Oh, no, no thank you, I'd just like to get down to the hospital. Jack, will you come with me? - Yes, of course. - Bob suggested I stay here, among friends, as he put it, but I'd really like to get down there. - Of course. (telephone ringing) - Hello. Yes, Bob. Don died a few moments ago. (sad orchestral music) - Jen, I can't stay long. I promised I'd be back at the hospital before lunch. - Yes, I know, but just stay for a drink. You, too, Jack. - [Jack] Sure. - Kay, look after them, will you? I just want a minute with the children. - Sure, honey. - Thanks. - What should we do now? - Well, I'd really like you both to go upstairs and change out of these clothes, okay? Oh, hey, sweetie, it's okay. It's gonna be all right. You'll see, both of you. Sarah will go upstairs and help you change. Won't you, Sarah? - Of Course. - And after everyone's gone, we'll have some lunch, okay? Okay. You, too, Michael. - Why can't I stay down here, with you and the others? Well, you may, if you wish. But I'd rather you went upstairs with Sarah and Emma, to change. Please, Michael. - Will he be all right, Mommy? - Sure he will, sweetheart. Just needs a little time to himself. Guess we all do, scoot. - [Bob] Everything okay? - Yeah, I think so. Michael's pretty mad, because he feels he oughta be down here with the adults. - He reckons he's the man about the house. He'll want to prove it, just see if he doesn't. - How old is he, now? I always forget. - Oh, thanks, 12. - Oh, that's a tough age on boys. Makes them as moody as the devil. My two drove Roger and me crazy. - Yeah, comes out in all ways. Jen, I have to go. Call me if there's anything. Anything, you understand? - And, thanks, Bob, for, well, you know. - I know. - [Jack] I'll go with you. - [Jennifer] Jack. - Yeah. - Would you mind staying for a few minutes? There's a couple of things I want to talk to you about. - Sure, sure I can. - Jen, call me, okay? Jack. - I'll go and find out what's going on upstairs. See you, Jack. - Where do we go from here? I guess we have to talk. - Well, I could stop by tomorrow. Or would you rather leave it for a few days? - Could I call you in the morning? - Sure, whenever. - There's some things I want to ask your advice about. - Okay, is there anything you want to ask me now? - No. I haven't quite made up my mind. - I thought it a good idea to get together informally and talk about the future. The past, and the future. Now, Lee, any problems? - Well, the stock's gone down another six points. And I suppose it could go down some more until people understand that Don's death isn't going to affect the company's performance. - How can you be sure of that? Don's not a man you can easily replace. - Impossible to replace, Eric, what I meant was, the company is in great shape, never better. - With the exception of top management. Oh, I'm not talking about you, Lee, of course I'm not. But as you said yourself, Don is irreplaceable. So we'll just have to make the best of things. Not that there's any question who will be running the company. - Thank you. You and Bob would support that on behalf of the Foundation, wouldn't you, Eric? - Nobody could run the company now, except Lee, George. I'm sure Bob will agree with that. - Good, then there's the question of who will be company chairman. If I remember correctly, the company statutes provide that the election of a new chairman by the directors must be unanimous. Isn't that right, Neil? - Yes, Mr. Prince was most insistent. - I don't think there should be a problem there, George. - In principle, I agree, but I think it's better not to jump to conclusions. - Oh, certainly, not, but in the meantime, somebody ought to speak to Jennifer. Keep her in the picture, shall I? - Yes, she has a lot at stake here. In many ways, more than any of us. She must have her say. - Yes. - Set, one, two, three, four. Five, six, seven. (pensive orchestral music) - Michael. Michael, darling. Oh, hey. Come on, it's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right, you'll see. I know it's hard to believe right now, but it's gonna be okay, I promise. Come here. I love you. - Yes, George, I'll tell her. No, I won't forget, no. Okay, I will, yes, I'll call you, all right. George Black wants to talk to you. - [Jennifer] Did he say about what? - No, and I didn't ask him. But you can bet it's about the company. You wanna talk to him? You don't have to. - Oh, I think so, yes. Shall I call him? - Let me, just for the moment, I want George and everyone else to know, that you're only making decision after talking with me. That way, they'll be more careful. - Do I need to be careful? - Who doesn't? Shall we get on? Now, Jennifer, in his will, Don left everything to you and the children, apart from some, some bequests, and his stock in the company. - Not the stock, what do you mean? - Let me finish, okay? Now the stock has been placed in a family trust for the eventual benefit of Michael and Emma. Now, during your life, the income, dividends, et cetera, will go to you, and you have the sole right to vote the stock any way you like, after discussion with your co-executor. - Who is? - Me. - Oh, that's great, really. - Thank you. Does that have anything to do with what was on your mind yesterday? - [Jennifer] Yes. - You want to, you want to tell me about it, or is it still a secret? - I want to be a director of the company. - I think you should be. - A working director, Jack, not just a stooge. - You want to go to work for the company? - I want more than that, I want to run the company, with Lee. - Why? I'm sorry, I'm just a little shell-shocked. But, why, Jennifer? - Because I need to go back to work. Because it's Don's company, which I helped to start. Because I want the company there for Michael and Emma. Because I was good at my job. And because I want it, is that enough? - Even if it were, for me, it won't be for the others. - Who? Apart from Lee. - George Black. - George? That is a surprise. He gives me the impression he likes women. - In the bedroom, not in the boardroom. (Jennifer laughs) Now you've got me being indiscreet. What I meant to say was, that George believes a woman's place is in the home. - [Jennifer] Ah, an original thinker. What about Professor Wohlstrom? - That's tough to answer. But I think he'd find it impossible to support you because you haven't had recent business experience. - Yeah, I know. Well, I'm sure Bob would be on my side. What about you, Jack? - I knew my number was coming up. I'm all for your coming on the board of the company. And working for the company, if that's what you want. - But. - Yeah, but. Running the company with Lee? That's something else again. Couldn't you have waited a couple of weeks? - You think two weeks might be enough? - You're really serious about all this, aren't you? - Yes, I'm serious. - He'd asked me to marry him, did you know that? - Yes, he told me. - Oh, what am I gonna do? This apartment, everything belongs to him. I haven't got a thing. Just isn't fair. - Well, maybe we can work something out. - I don't want a lot. Just enough to, oh, I don't know, get out, go someplace. - Where would you like to go? - I don't know. London, I've got a sister there, she's always asking me. - Would you like me to set it up? - Get me out of town, huh? Okay, set it up. But I want some money. - [Lee] How much? - 5,000, no, 10. I deserve 10, don't I? After all, if Don hadn't died, I'd have had everything. A lot. Okay. Five, can you arrange that? I guess you'll be the big chief now, won't you? - We'll see. - Yeah, what about Jennifer, she'll have something to say. Oh, I bet she does. I would, if I were her. She's got all the power now, all that money. You don't like that, do you. You don't even like her. - She's okay. - Sure, Lee, sure. The funny thing is, you'd have been better off if it had been me left behind, not Jennifer. (soft orchestral music) - Hi, Ben. - Oh, hello, Mrs. Prince. - Everything okay? - Yes, yes, everything's fine. - Hi, Annie. - Why, Mrs. Prince, you're early. Welcome. - Can I go right in? - Sure you can, what a question. Now, it isn't going to bother you being here, is it? - No, I don't think so. - Because if it does, just say the word, and we can go someplace else. - Does it seem strange to you, too, Annie? All so empty. - Oh, this place won't ever be the same, not ever. Well, you had some things you wanted us to do today. - I just thought I'd get started answering these cards and letters. What's this? - [Annie] That's where Mr. Prince kept his private papers. - Do you have a key? - I think Mr. Devlin might, or Jack, I guess. Do you want me to find out? - Oh, no, no don't bother. I'll ask Mr. Devlin when I see him. - [Lee] Good morning. - Hello. - Annie says you have some things you want done. - Yes, a lot of thank you notes for letters and flowers. Lee, there was something I wanted to ask you. Would you mind coming to the office with me for a moment? You don't know anyone called Joan, do you? - Joan, Joan who? - Oh, that's the thing, I don't know. She sent some flowers to the funeral. I called the florist, they remember the order, but they didn't remember her name. About 30, they said, and very pretty. Do you know who she is? - No. - Well, I was gonna send her a thank you note. Then I remembered the initial on the scarf, and I just thought it might be the same one. - No, that was Janet. - Oh. - Anything else? - Yes, Annie said she thought you had a key to this. Have you? - Can I ask why you want it? - I want to open it, see what's there. - Shouldn't Jack do that, as executor? - I'm an executor, too. - Well, of course, Jennifer. - May I have the key, please, Lee? Don't worry, I'm not gonna be giving away any company secrets. - Oh, I know that, but. - I want the key. May I have it, please? - I'm sorry, I can't give it to you. - Oh, there you are, Mr. Devlin. Your secretary's been looking all over for you. - Thank you, Annie. If there's anything else you need, Jennifer, just let me know. - Is there anything? - Maybe later, Annie, thank you. - I gotta hand it to you, kid. If I had just lost Roger, I would have been in bed for a week. My eyes, like raw hamburger. - Well, I'm sure it'll hit me sooner or later, but right now, there's too much to do. - Honey, give yourself some time. - Time, Kay, I've had years. Waiting, waiting for Don, waiting for the kids. Waiting for something. Thinking all the time, I knew I could be doing something useful, now I'm sick of waiting. I want to do. - Do, do what? - Work. - You're kidding, why? - When I was working with Don, those were the happiest days of my life. - That's a long time ago, honey. Maybe you're just being nostalgic. - No, it's true. And then, and then I wanted a baby, and I got pregnant with Michael, and it all changed. Don thought of me as a housewife and mother, not a partner, and we grew apart. We never did get it back together again. Now Don's dead, and I wish to God he weren't. Even with our differences, I loved him. Loved him, and respected him, a lot. But now Don's gone, and I want to do it my way. - Well, what sort of work were you thinking of? More charities? - I'm going to work for the company. - [Kay] Jennifer, why? - Aside from everything else, it'll be fun. I'll be learning, there's a lot of catching up to do. - Fun, (laughs) you're crazy. Oh, what I wouldn't give for this kind of fun. And you want to work. Will they want you to work there? - Honestly, I don't know. And honestly, I don't care. I started that company with Don, and I have a right to be there. And, I am determined to have my own way. - [Annie] I'm so glad it was you, Mr. Devlin. I was shaking in my shoes. - I'm sorry. - That's okay, just so it was you. Oh, I'm glad you found those keys. Mrs. Prince was wondering what happened to them. - Good night, Annie. - [Annie] Just suppose it was a thief. - It was good of you to see me. - Jack said it was important. Sit down, George. - Important, I guess it is. I wanted to talk to you about matters which mutually concern us. As senior director, I think it's important to settle a new management structure of the company. Put a stop to rumor. And I wanted to keep you in the picture. - That was very thoughtful. - The directors believe that-- - Then there's been a board meeting? - Officially, no. - Oh, well, I was just curious because Jack hasn't mentioned anything. - A few of us got together, informally, to talk about the future. - Did you make any decisions? - Decisions, no. But, we felt we could recommend to everybody that Lee be confirmed as chief executive. And that we look for a new company chairman as soon as possible. Do you agree? - Yes, I agree, we need a new chairman. Have you any idea who that should be? - Oh, not really, but. - Perhaps you could be persuaded, George. If you'd be interested, you could count on my support. - Well, thank you, thank you. And may I ask what plans you have for the future? Or is it too early? - I have decided I want to be active again. - Oh, can I be of help? - Yes, George, I think you can. - Tell me how. - I'd like to think you'd support me as a director of the company. A working director. - I'm sure the board would welcome you as a director, Jennifer, and they most certainly would, if I were chairman. But, working, what do you have in mind? - To relearn the business, from bottom to top. - But starting from the top. I apologize. - Oh, that's all right, George. Don't forget I started the company with Don. And after the Foundation, I control the largest block of stock. - Let me think about the best way to handle this, Jennifer. And let me assure you of my support, whatever it is you want to do. My concern is to do the right thing for everybody. - [Jennifer] Oh, of course. - Well, I really must go now. - [Jennifer] Thank you for stopping by, George. - My pleasure. Why don't we have dinner one night, talk about this again? - Oh, all right. - You know, Jennifer, you make a most attractive widow. - Patronizing old fool. (soft orchestral music) (sobbing) - No way, no, I won't consider the idea. It's crazy, no, that's final. - Well, I think you're making a mistake. Chances are, in a couple of months, she'll get bored. Go down to Acapulco. - [Lee] Two months is too long. - Aren't you overlooking her position as a stockholder? - Don't misunderstand me, I have nothing against Jennifer becoming a director, but I will not have her working here as a what? - An executive. - No! - In some places, it could be seen as a generous gesture from an enlightened board. - Only in places that don't count! - All right, I'll tell her. But she won't be pleased. The board meeting's Thursday at 11. Jennifer will be there, she's up for election as a director. I don't know where she stands on this other thing. - Just a minute, George. Something's come up we should talk about. Jennifer called me last night. To say she was angry would be an understatement. I thought the phone would catch fire. - What about? - You, she said she asked for the keys to Don's filing cabinet, and that you refused to give them to her. - I had a reason. - Well, I guess Annie told Jennifer that she found you going through the cabinet after everyone had gone home. As Don's executor, can I ask why? - Why, Lee? - For the past three years, Don was having an affair. They'd become very close. Much closer than he was to Jennifer. Just before he died, Don asked her to marry him. She accepted. - Joan Russell. - Yes, how did you know? - She's named in Don's will. I didn't know why before. In fact, I was going to ask Jennifer if she knew who she was. I'm glad I didn't. Where is the girl now? - She's in London, I arranged for her to go visit her sister there. - For how long? - I don't know. - What's in there? - There's letters, cards, mementos from Joan. Don made a habit of keeping things like that. He was sentimental that way. When Jennifer asked for the key, I refused because I knew she'd find them. No matter how strongly I feel against Jennifer working here, I didn't want her to have to face this. If I were you, Jack, I'd burn it. - I'll do that. But it won't change the fact that Don left her a potful of money. Jennifer will have to be told. And I guess I'm the one who has to tell her. - But you don't have to tell her that Don planned to marry the girl. - No. No, I don't have to tell her that. (soft piano music) - May I? - Of course, I love the smell of a good cigar. - Jennifer. I've spoken to Lee about your suggestion that you work for the company. I didn't want to bring it up earlier, and spoil our evening, but he's dead set against it. I'm sorry. - Why? - Well, he thinks the timing isn't right. And with Don only, well I think some people in the company might resent it. - Do you, George, resent it? - Me, no, not at all. I think Lee's exaggerating. And in time, I think he'll come around to our way of thinking. - I don't want to wait, George. - Of course you don't, and I respect that, very much. But I don't think we should go upsetting Lee right now. - Well, I don't want to upset anyone. But I need to go back to work. I want to, and I mean to. - I'm delighted you feel so strongly. I've been thinking how to get around the problem. And I think I may have come up with something that you may like. - Oh, tell me. - If I became chairman, Jennifer, if, I wouldn't be able to spend as much time in the corporation as I'd like. I'd have to spend a lot of time elsewhere. So what I was wondering was, how would you like to come and work for me? As a kind of high-powered personal assistant, involved in the running of the company, but reporting only to me. - Go on. - Well, I could help you. Introduce you to the right people. Advise you. Explain things. And it could only strengthen your position as a director. How about it? - Then you've no objection to my becoming a director? - No, and even Lee understands the fairness of that. - And you support my working for the company? - Under the right circumstances, yes. I see you as a very desirable company asset. - What you're really saying, George, is you'll support my directorship and my work if I'll support you as chairman. Or did I get that wrong? Don't be angry, George, I understand. This is business. Hi, Jack, sorry I kept you waiting. What's the matter? - Oh, I've just got some things on my mind. How was your evening with George? - Oh, lord, that man can be patronizing. He offered me a job as his personal assistant. High-powered, of course. - What did you tell him? - We made a deal. I support him as chairman, if he supports my working for the company. - Doing what, do you know yet? - I'm still not sure. To be honest, I still haven't given up the idea of running the company with Lee. - Jennifer, I wouldn't, Lee is-- - Oh, I know. I know it's a bit presumptuous, but I talked to Bob, and he's all for it. He thinks women in business can be just as capable as men. - Bob's a doctor, he's used to seeing women around him all the time. - That's my point, we just have to get them used to it. - Are you sure that George wants to be chairman? I thought he had enough to do. He's on more boards than you can shake a stick at. - Oh, I know he wants it. And he knows I know. What he doesn't know, is that I'm thinking of running for executive vice-president. Oh, only thinking, Jack, I'd need your support. What's wrong? - Jennifer, do you remember when we met in my office to talk about Don's will? - [Jennifer] Mm hm. - Do you recall that I mentioned there were some bequests? - [Jennifer] Yes. - Does the name Joan Russell mean anything to you? - Joan. - Yes. - Someone named Joan sent some flowers to the funeral. Could it be the same one? - I don't know, probably. Jennifer, about six months before Don died, he had me add a codicil to his will. - For her? - [Jack] Yes. - How much? How much, Jack, I wanna know. - A hundred thousand dollars. - She was his mistress, wasn't she. More than a mistress. - I don't know. - Come on, Jack, don't be so bloody squeamish. You don't leave a hundred thousand dollars to your secretary. - No. - Who else knew about her? Who else? George? - Yes. - [Jennifer] Bob? - I'm not sure, but I'd guess so. - Oh, Lee. Lee knew all along, didn't he. That was his, that was her scarf, wasn't it? - I don't know about any scarf, Jennifer. But Lee knew, yes. I don't think Eric Wohlstrom did. - Not Eric, oh, well, that's something. - I'm sorry. - You must have thought I was a fool. - No. I thought Don was the fool. - Thanks. - Jennifer, the reason I think that working with Lee and the others is a bad idea is because they know so much about, well, so much. It'd embarrass you. - It won't. I don't care what George and Lee think. It's your support I'm after, Jack. The question is, do you think I could do a job as executive vice-president? - It'd be tough. There'd be resentment. - I know, and I know I don't have the experience, but I can do it, I know I can. And I'm a good businesswoman, Jack, you'll see. And I have a feeling for the company. Trust me, and support me, please. - Jennifer. - Oh, hi, Bob, what is it, what's happened? - Minor domestic crisis, nothing to worry about, really. - Well, what? - Mike and his friend Jerry got ahold of a box of Don's cigars, smoked them. - All of them? - Jerry, one, Mike, two. With the very natural result, they're both sick as dogs, come on. I promised Mike I wouldn't tell you about the cigar, so don't give me away. - No, okay. - As far as you know, it was something he ate. - Michael, what happened, how are you feeling? - Sick. - Oh, wonder what it could have been? Dr. Symon was saying it must have been something you ate. Poor baby. - I guess so. - What a pity. You know, you were saying we don't have steak that much, any more, well I got some for tonight. And onion rings, and I asked Sarah to make up a batch of french fries. But-- - Mom, maybe if we don't eat too early. I mean, maybe I could still have some. - Oh no, darling, I don't think so. A soft-boiled egg and some toast, right, Bob? - Yeah, best thing for you, Mike. - And I got some chocolate ice cream, too. Well, maybe you can have some of that later, we'll see. I hope I wasn't too hard on him. - Truly, a couple of soft-boiled eggs are better for him. - Bob, I know this may sound silly, but suppose it had been serious. - Well? - I should have been here. Instead of going to that meeting, I should have been here. Shouldn't I? - Doesn't make the slightest bit of difference. The two of them would have smoke the same number of cigars. Mike still would have fainted. - Yes, but Bob-- - Hey, if you're gonna go blaming yourself for everything that happens while you're not home, you're not gonna last a week at the company. You gotta get your priorities straight and stick to them. - Well, maybe I shouldn't work. The kids must come first. The job, all that company stuff, I'm just feeding my ego. - Egos need to be fed. They get hungry. And yours is starved for too long. The only question you have to ask yourself is, do I want a career and a family enough, enough, to make it work? Do you? - Yes. - [Bob] Good. - Do you think I can do it? - Isn't that why I promised you my support tomorrow? - Ah, I thought I'd find you here. - Hello, George. - It's a fine view, isn't it? Fine view. I guess a lot better than you can get from your office. - I wouldn't disagree. - They do say, don't they, that everything comes to those who wait. - I haven't got everything, yet, George. - No, but within an hour you'll be officially running this company, I guarantee it. - What about Jennifer? - Mrs. Prince and I had dinner together the other night. Over coffee, we came to a mutual and happy understanding about the future that will not interfere with your running of the company. - You're sure about that? - Over the years, Lee, I've made it my business to understand women. It's a happy knack, if you can do it. I can. Shall we? Thank you. I won't dwell on the tragic circumstances which created the need for this meeting. Let me only say that we mourn the passing of Don, and welcome most sincerely his widow, Jennifer. - Thank you. - [All] Hear, hear. - We welcome Mrs. Prince today as a trustee of the Foundation, along with Eric and Bob. And are pleased that she wishes to stand for election as a director of her late husband's company. Now, everyone has a copy of today's agenda in front of them. Neil, would you take it from there? - Thank you, George. The first four pieces of business are, one, the election of Mr. Lee Devlin as the company's chief executive. Item two, the election of Mrs. Jennifer Prince to the board of directors. Item three is the election of a new company chairman. Item four is the approval of the draft press release which I've prepared, without names, of course, a copy of which is attached. May I remind everyone that item three, the election of a new company chairman must be by unanimous vote. All other elections are by majority vote. George. - Thank you. Any questions? - I don't have a question, but I do have a request. Am I allowed a request? - I don't think anybody would have any objections, Jennifer, go ahead. - Oh, thank you. Because of the way the agenda is drafted, item two, dealing with my election to the board comes after Lee's nomination as chief executive. I am therefore deprived of a vote on this important matter, although I will be allowed to vote on the election of the new chairman, which comes later. - Oh, yes, I see. I would like to formally propose that item two be placed above item one. - I second. - Against? Carried. - In that case, I would like to propose that Mrs. Jennifer Prince be a director of Prince Marine Industries. - I hate to interrupt again, George. - [George] What is it this time, Jennifer? - I not only wish to stand for election as a director, but also as the company's executive vice-president. - [George] Executive vice-president? - Yes, I wish to be a working part of this company. I have a large stockholding, and naturally, I care very much how this company is run, and by whom. - Jennifer, as you can see, this has come as something of a surprise to most of us. Would you mind leaving us for a few moments? - I think I'd rather stay and face the music. - Very well, Neil. - Does someone propose Mrs. Jennifer Prince for election as the company's executive vice-president? - I do. - I second. - Against? - I am. - I regret it, but I must be, too. - George, it's up to you, then. - I support Mrs. Prince. (lighthearted orchestral music) Congratulations. - Thank you. - You realize he may resign, don't you? - I don't think so. Let a woman put him down, no. You angry with me? I'm sorry, but I realized the other night after dinner, that you did not see me as a top executive, so I had to try a little finesse. - What I do not see you as, is executive vice-president. - Then I'll just have to prove you wrong, won't I? - One of the virtues of an old-fashioned background like mine, is that you learn to lose gracefully. But only once, Jennifer. Next time, talk to me, first. - Yes, Mr. Chairman. - Will you be having lunch with the men today, Mrs. Prince? - No, no, Annie, not today, thank you. Could I have something in the office? - Oh sure you can. We have cold roast beef and salad, and we had some great strawberries. - Sounds wonderful. - Cream and sugar, on the strawberries? - Hm? - Cream and sugar? - Oh, sure, cream. Plenty of cream, Annie. Plenty of cream. Do you like my new hat? (happy orchestral music) (upbeat orchestral music)
