(dramatic music) - [Female] Phil! - [Male] Get on your knees, asshole! - You think you can fuck with me and my brothers. Is that what you think? - No, no, we didn't know, man! Fuck! - Your little mom and pop operation ain't shit! This is our world and you gotta pay to live in it. You've got til three to come up with some serious cash and since I know you ain't got it I'm gonna count fast so we can get this over with quick like. One, two. (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) - Holy shit! Thanks. (gun firing) (shouting) (gun firing) (gun firing) (ringing) - [Operator] 911, what is the address of your emergency? Hello? Is there someone on the line? (sirens blaring) (indistinct radio chattering) - Lieutenant Starnes, guys, follow me. I got bodies. (suspenseful music) (fire crackling) (groaning) (groaning) It's a fucking meth lab. (mooing) (gun firing) Christ. All clear here. (phone ringing) - [Male] Hello. - Mr. Reynolds, sorry to bother you. I know it's-- - Yeah, it's late. What's up, Starnes? - Well. - What the hell, Starnes? What'd you wake me up for? - We found Jacoby Garnett upstairs full of holes. Looks like he stopped by to lean on some freelancers. Only thing is looks like the ma and pa squad was ready for him. - Shit. Alright look. You find out what you can find out and we'll talk in the morning. - [Starnes] Alright, bye. (yelling) (phone ringing) - Haskell. - Good morning, senator. Hey, did you see today's paper? - Yeah. They're trying to bury me. - No, not that one. Page two. They're calling it a minor turf war. (laughing) Can you believe that? - Excellent. Looks like your man has passed the test. - He's the best, yeah, no, he won't let you down. I promise you that. - How quickly can we get him started on the other two? - I'll make it happen. - Good morning. - Good morning. Come on, Brit, there's no time to eat. - [Britney] Mom, I'm starving. - [Fiona] We'll be late for the plane. We'll get you something at the airport. - Honey, listen to your mother. - Get your things, Britney. - Fiona, you look beautiful. (phone ringing) - [Female] Gonna get that, Gene? - Britney, honey, tick tock. - Where's daddy? - He's being a selfish bastard again. Gene. Gene, we're leaving. - I gotta go. My little girl going away to college. I love you, honey. - Love you too, daddy. Be strong. - I will. - Thanks mom. - Sure. - Okay. - Just wanted to go down on the record that I feel this a terrible time for you to be leaving me. - I'll be back when I'm back, okay? - Alright. - [Celeste] Hello. You're looking for Mr. Haskell? Well this is Mrs. Haskell, Celeste Haskell. Yes, the senator's (mumbling) today, sorry. - [Gene] What are you doing? (screaming) - She's gone, she's gone and she's never coming back. Oh my God, we're gonna be so happy. - What? - Yes, now we can be together the way we were meant to be. It was fate. I knew, I knew, from the first time you came to my room that night. - Celeste, that was six months ago and that was wrong. - No, it was not. - It was wrong. - No, it was not. - Celeste. - We can. - [Gene] No, we can't. - Yes we can. - [Gene] No, we can't. - Yes. - [Gene] Don't do it - Is that wrong? - Yes. - No, it's not. - [Gene] Yes it is. - No, it's not. I know you want me. (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) - You ever drink Courvoisier? - When I'm with my boyfriend. - Oh, you've got a boyfriend. Well that would explain your rudeness. What's up, sunshine? How you doing, man? Hey, excellent job the other night, by the way. Just have to say you pulled that off like something I've never seen. I mean just immaculate. I wanted to know exactly how you did it so fast and efficient. - I told you, I never discuss a job. - Right and you know what, that's one of the things that I really like about you. I mean let's face it, there's a lot of garbage men in this town that are willing to just kinda throw their trash out there for everybody to talk about. - You got something for me? - Cut to the chase, I like that too. I do, in fact. Here you go. Count 'em up, it's all there. Wait, sit back down. Got something else for you. - So are you two ordering or what? - Yeah, I'll have a Bloody Mary, sweetheart. You? - I'll have a glass of your best Merlot. - You heard the man. Give him some fucking wine, for Christ sakes. Attitude central. Anyway, listen. This is very important because this guy's a scumbag. I mean a real fucking piece of work. - I don't care. When? - Today, tomorrow. I don't fucking give a shit, just get it done. - If you think this is gonna go down tonight or tomorrow or any time soon, it's gonna cost you. It's real hot outside right now. - Fine, we'll double it. I got it. How much? - 19.02 plus tip. - [Male] Keep the change. - Thank you, Daddy Warbucks. - Don't mention it. Come back around in an hour. Maybe I'll give you some more. The fuck are you going? Just got my drink. Hey, the shit don't grow on trees, you know. - May I help you? - Well Mr. Franklin, I will definitely keep your concerns in mind. Come on in. Yes, when I, yes, right. You're late. - I'm sorry. - Oh, my volunteers would love if you dropped off a batch of your freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. Alright, okay, and Mrs. Franklin, don't forget to vote. Okay, bye bye. Well? - Well what, there was a lot of traffic. - Don't mess with me. - Oh, yeah, don't worry about it. I got it covered. Our man's on it. - Same as before? - Yeah, no witnesses, right? What? - I don't like your attitude. - You don't like my, I don't understand you sometime. - Yes? - [Female] You have a visitor, sir. - Not now, I'm in a meeting. - [Female] She says she's your wife. - My wife? I'll be out in a moment. - Thought your wife was out of town. - Never mind. - Listen, we've gotta go over this-- - Look, look, look, I can't talk right now. - Okay but you know what? It's closing in on us and we've got legislation-- - Listen, I want you to go over to the restaurant and make sure everything's set for the judge for tonight, alright? - Fine. Swear I'll do it. - What are you looking at? - Nothing. - What are you doing here? - I came here to help. I even got a pin. - Celeste. You can't just show up here like this. - Oh come on, I'm just trying to help. At the very least, I could help you lick envelopes or something. - You shouldn't be here. I have a lot of work to do and I can't be late for my dinner engagement tonight. - You have a meeting? - With the judge. - Why can't I come? People should see you out with your wife. - Excuse me? - People should see you out with your wife. - You're not my wife. - Yes I am. - No, you're not. - Yes I am. Yes I am. - You're not my wife! I don't wanna play this game. I'll tell you what. Why don't you go home and I won't be late. I'll finish dinner early and when I get back we can talk. - Fine. - Oh good. - I hope you lose the election, you fucking selfish bastard. - Your honor, what's the verdict? Do we continue to support the fishermen of Maine? - As long as they protect the native habitat of the bottle nosed dolphin, I say we throw 'em a God damn ticker tape parade. (laughing) - [TV Reporter] By District Attorney Reynolds, US Senator Gene Haskell has been indicted by a federal grand jury. He now faces charges of money laundering, racketeering, and conspiring to falsify evidence. No hearing date has yet been set. Faced with a strong challenge for his US senate seat, a spokesperson said of this indictment quote, a sick fantasy in the mind of a demented DA. In other news, the USDA says-- - Looks like I might be in a world of shit. - He's digging deep. Bound to find something. Even if it leads nowhere, Gene, he's gonna try to hurt you. - Let him try. - Saw where you had a little bit of good fortune yesterday. - Excuse me? - Your man's good, Gene. Your man is real good. - I don't think I know what you're talking about. - Well, just make sure you keep your head down. - God damn it, Warren, I built this house of cards and nothing's going to happen to it unless I say so. You have nothing to worry about. - Right. Well, I plan to be at your inauguration next month wearing a big fat smile. - Thank you, your honor. Who knows? Six more years inside the beltway and I'll be able to support any bad habit that you might pick up. (laughing) (rock music) - [Female] How can I help you, ma'am? - Hi, I'm here to see Senator Gene Haskell. I believe he's dining with you tonight. - One moment please. - Hello, hi. You're looking wonderful this evening. - Fine, thanks, I'm here to see Gene. - Yes, of course, the senator. He's actually a bit preoccupied right now. - Monica and the kids, how are they doing? - They were blown up in a tragic plane crash, thanks for asking though. - That's good, that's good. - Maybe we can arrange a private meeting of some sort later to discuss your future with the senator. - Why don't you just tell the senator that his wife is here to see him? - His wife, of course. - Don't worry, he'll definitely wanna see me. - Right. - What is she, Gene? Another campaign muffin? - Something like that. - You know, he doesn't typically see his constituents at a place like this. - I'm not sure who you are. - My name is Mark Leiter. I happen to be the senator's-- - Whatever. Just run along and tell the senator that I'm here to see him. - You know, I would love nothing more than to help a special person like yourself. You just wait right here. The fuck outta here. - No, Gene! Gene, please, I'm sorry, please! We were meant to be together, Gene! - Alright, alright, God damn. - Hey Starnes. Look, there's a young lady being ushered out of the restaurant as we speak. Find out who she is. Honey, would you excuse me a moment? Judge Harper. - Hello Tanner. - Senator Haskell. - Mr. District Attorney. - Gentlemen. I take it your enjoying the ambience. - Very much. - [Tanner] How's the lobster, Warren? - Excellent, and how is Mrs. Reynolds this evening? - Well she's doing grand. Though we don't get to see much of each other due to my full plate. - Don't let your duties keep you from your family. - You're so right about that. Nothing more important than family. In fact, it's amazing what some people might do to protect or avenge their family. - That is a fascinating instinct. - It certainly is. I guess you could say I'm a student of the human condition. Take for instance a man's predisposition to hunt. That is a fascinating instinct. In fact, I've heard that some men actually smear the blood of their prey all over themselves to signify a connection with the beast. - I prefer to stuff mine and mount them as trophies. (laughing) - Yeah, I'm not surprised. Well, I'd better get back to my sweetheart. I don't want her to think I'm fooling around with some sweet young little thing, now would I, senator? Gentlemen. - Cocky little bastard, isn't he? - He certainly is. Cognac? (upbeat music) - Senator, you wanna tell me what's going on with this little hoochie mama you got visiting you at the restaurant, please? - Oh, that's nothing, it's unimportant. - It is in actuality important because it's my job and my job is to cover your ass. - Well her family was very close to ours. Parents died in a car accident three years ago so we took the young lady in. She's just a little emotional. That's it. - It's a beautiful story. Unfortunately, I can't seem to buy it so I need to know the truth. I need you to just lay it out for me, please, sir. Are you fucking her or what? - Jesus Christ, man. - You're not gonna answer me, are you? I need to know the truth. I need to know the facts. I've gotta be able to give a story-- - Something happened once but it was nothing. Just once. - Okay, well it didn't seem like nothing. I mean Jesus Christ, this woman looked like, I mean she said she was your fucking wife for God's sakes. Your wife. I mean she doesn't even look like she's old enough to be your wife. She doesn't even look like she's 18. Tell me she's 18. Oh God, no, please, tell me she's 18. - She's not. - I don't know what I'm gonna do, man. And on top of it all, Reynolds saw the whole God damn thing. He was sitting right there watching it and you know that that cocksucker is waiting for the first opportunity he gets, the first open hole so he can drown you and on top of that you're dealing with the allegations, the accusations, and the fact that you're 11 points behind and we're two weeks out. - Alright, now just relax partner. I'll take care of Reynolds and I'll take care of the girl. - Why don't you do me a favor? Please, why don't you let me take care of the girl? - In what way. - I'll just handle it. I'll just do what I do. I will make her disappear for a week or two until this blows-- - Do not touch the girl. - Okay. - Everything will be just fine. (rock music) Have the girl picked up right away and make sure nothing happens to her and I mean nothing. - Hey sporto, how you doing? Looking good. New haircut? Looks nice on you. Got something special for you today. - [Male] I'm listening. - Well let's just say it doesn't play to your finer qualities. - [Male] What is it? - Well there's this girl. We'd like you to seek her out, find her. Get her and hold on to her for a few weeks. (suspenseful music) (electronic music) - Scotch, rocks. - What are you looking at? You're not dancing. - I didn't come to dance. - It's a dance club, you're supposed to dance. - I'm here for you. - For me? Well I am right here. - Why don't you come with me? - I don't even know you. Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you. - [Male] What happened to your hand? - I cut myself. Wow, you have a long lifeline. See mine? It goes on and on and on. I'm gonna live to be an old lady. Do you believe in fate? - You could say that. - I think you were meant to come here which means we were fated to meet. - I think you're right. - Everything happens for a reason, mister, you don't say much, do you? I'm Celeste. - Why don't we get out of here and get some coffee? I'll tell you everything you wanna know about me. - Yeah, okay, I'll have some coffee with you. You know I don't normally do this but with you I'll make an exception. What are you doing, freak? My husband's gonna have you killed! Don't think that they're not gonna come looking for me, you fucking asshole! Someone get me out of here! I'm claustrophobic, you fucking sadistic bastard! Come on, you can't keep me here! Hello? Hey! - Vice 5108 to radio. - [Male] 51 dispatch standby. 51, go ahead. - Signal 63, officer down, 1428 Lawrence Street. Requesting ambulance and additional units. (rock music) - [Police Officer] Police! Hands up! (screaming) Everybody get their hands up! (gun firing) (gun firing) - What the hell? - It's a vice raid, officer down. Get inside quick. (somber music) - Can I go to the bathroom, please? And how am I supposed to get to the bathroom? - I'll carry you to the bathroom. Put 'em on your ankles. - I'll hold it. - Suit yourself. - Wait. I really have to go. - Son of a bitch! - Jesus! What the hell are you doing out there? You're gonna start a God damn war! - Oh you must have seen my work in the papers. - Oh come on, you can't just, you can't just go and do whatever you want! I got deals everywhere! You gotta talk to me first! Archie's gonna retaliate about this whole thing. - Hey, fuck Archie, okay? You don't need to worry about that no more. All you need to worry about is somebody to pin this on and I'll tell you who it is. It's that Reynolds motherfucker. That's who you're gonna pin it on because he would take you down in two seconds if he had the chance. - That's a good idea, can we do that? - I know it is, yes, of course. - Yeah, that'll buy us some time, won't it? - Yes. - How much time? - At least a couple days. - Good, good, good. God, I hope your guy knows what he's doing. - Hey, trust me, my guy's a professional. He knows what he's doing. Give him a few days, alright? Then we'll file the motion. We'll get this indictment behind us. Everything will be over with. - Yeah, good, good. The girl, how's she doing? - She's great. I put her away, it's fine, she's out of the way. You don't have to worry about that. - That's not what I asked you. How's the girl? - She's fine. - Can I have something to eat, please? - What? - You kill people for a living, don't you? - [Male] What would make you say that? - I saw your gun. And I saw the look in your eyes when you left last night and then when you came back this morning. You killed someone last night, didn't you? - No. - Yeah you did. - [Male] No, I didn't. - Yeah you did. Are you gonna kill me? - Not today. (dramatic music) - What the fuck, you guys? What the fuck are you doing? Seriously, what the fuck? Just talk to me. Tell me where the fuck we're going down this long ass hallway. For Christ sake, do you have to hold me that tight? Seriously. First of all, this is a very nice suit. Secondly, come on, I'm a small guy. Where the fuck am I gonna go? Really, come on. This is fucking bullshit. Seriously, what the fuck? No, seriously, this sucks. You don't have to fucking grab my coat. Where the fuck are we going? Just tell me that. Archie. So good to see you. - [Archie] I thought you and me should have a little talk. Take the man's coat, gentlemen. He seems a little hot under the collar. - Class, see that. (mumbling) - First I will start with my hands. Then I will choose something from this table like maybe this hammer til you tell me what I need to know. Of course if you piss me off I may put a gun in your mouth and blow your fucking brains out. - That would be kind of messy, wouldn't it? Probably need to bring in a special cleaning crew for that one. - [Archie] Shut the fuck up until I'm finished! - Sorry about that. - Don't like your attitude. First it was Jacoby. Everyone says it was his fuck up. Meth cooking Bonnie and Clyde got the drop on 'em. I say okay, maybe that's how it went down. So we mourn him but get back to work. - Sorry about that too. - Then my sweet brother Drake goes out to get his dick sucked and gets whacked in a fucking raid? - Why would I have anything to do-- - So now I'm thinking what a dumb ass I am. Why didn't I put two and two together? Why didn't I think, why didn't I stop Drake? Tell your boss the Garnett's had nothing to do with his indictment. Tell him we didn't give Reynolds nothing and tell him I'm coming for him. - Now why the fuck would the old man have anything to do with this shit? It doesn't ... Make sense, it's stupid. - Tell Haskell I'm on to him. I'm gonna rip out his eyes and piss on the empty sockets. (yelling) - Motherfuckers! I'm gonna fucking kill you! Oh, you're so fucking dead! You're so fucking dead! I'm gonna fucking kill you. - You doing okay? - Do I look like I'm doing okay? Get me a rum and coke on the rocks and a double scotch, shot. - You wanna clean that up? - Give me some ice and a rag. I know you're wondering what the fuck happened to me. - Actually, I'm not. - Good, I'll tell you. This motherfucker jumped me and it wasn't even him that fucking did it because he was too much of a fucking pussy so he sent his fucking bad boys out to fucking hit me. - Maybe you didn't hear me. I don't give a shit. - That's why I love you. How's the girl? - I've got her. - She alive? - She's alive, you got something for me? - Yeah, I got you. - We done here. - No, we're not done. We're not done. I've got one more for you and this time, it's personal. - Not for me. - Yeah well it is for me. I not only want you to find this motherfucker and kill him, I want you to fucking beat him and fucking take his God damn eyeballs out of his fucking sockets and piss down 'em, you understand me? - That's extra. - That's right, I'm prepared to pay it. Thanks. - [Male] Where's the info? - Give me a minute, give me a minute. Oh fucker. Now listen to me very carefully. I want you to be careful, alright? He's gonna be watching out and he's gonna be very well protected at this point so just watch your ass. - Don't even hint for a second that you give a shit about my well being because it makes my stomach turn. - You're our boy. Of course I give a shit what happens to you. - Don't you ever bullshit me or I just might kill you. (laughing) - You're taking that very personally. That was very, very personal. Hey wait, you didn't finish your drink. (screaming) - Character. Pride. Integrity. Jesus Christ. What the hell happened to you? - What happened? What happened? Archie and his fucking men happened! They did this to me, they fucking cornered me and they fucking jumped me! - Archie. Wait a second, he doesn't think I had anything to do with anything. - I don't fucking know! How am I supposed to know? - Ah shit. What about our guy? - He's on it, he's been on it but he's gonna have to lay low now, man. He's gonna see it coming. He's gonna be watching for it. - Oh no, oh no. - Don't worry about it, okay? Your ass will be covered, okay? He'll take care of it. - You think so? Yeah, yeah, that's good, that's good. Ah shit. You alright? - Yeah, I'm great, I'm good. - Good. (tense music) - Don't you have anything a little more interesting? I have to go to the bathroom. Are you gonna rape me? - What? - Are you gonna rape me? Isn't that what somebody like you does when they kidnap somebody like me? - I wouldn't know. - Well what do you know? I'm ready. - What are you doing? Get dressed. - Don't you want me? - Save it, it's not gonna happen. - I could be a real bad girl. - This isn't about that. - Then what is it about then? What is it with you? What do you want from me? What's it like? - What's what like? - To end someone's life. I bet it makes you feel powerful, huh? Probably don't feel anything, do you? - It's never personal. - It is with me. At least my first one will be. - Meet me at my office in 30 minutes. I need to talk to you. (downbeat music) - [Celeste] Can you please leave the light on? - I need to see her. - See who? The girl? - Yes, the girl. - Okay. You know what, listen, I gotta be honest with you. I gotta just shoot from the hip at this point. I'm sorry but I think that's a real bad move at this point. I think that you need to just lay low and you need to let this whole Archie thing blow over before you even go down that path again. - I don't give a shit about Archie or anyone else. I wanna see that girl and I wanna see her tonight so go out and find her and bring her to me. - Fine, fine. I'll do that but let me tell you, I think you're making a big fucking mistake and I think it's gonna come back and bite you in the ass. - God damn it, just fucking do what I ask you to do! Go and find her now, thank you. - No problem. That's what I'm here for, to be your fucking rat. (car starting) (beeping) - Stupid. - Yeah, it's me. - Yeah. - Yeah, listen. We need to see the girl. We need you to bring her to us now. - Not now, I'm working. - Who the fuck are you working for? You work for me? - I'm taking care of that other business. - What am I supposed to tell him? - Tomorrow. - Oh man, he's gonna shit all over me, man. - Senator? - Yeah, is she here? - Gonna have to be tomorrow. - What? - It's gonna have to be tomorrow. - What? What kind of game your trying to play? I told you I need to see her tonight. - I'm not playing any games, alright? Our man's busy. He's dealing with the fucking Archie, that cocksucker, I wish I could kill him myself. - Alright, alright. Just make sure I see her before tomorrow's fundraiser. I need to be on top of my game. - Don't worry about it, I got it covered. Should I wash your dick for you too? (silenced gun firing) - Bang, your dead. Come on, come on. Now drop the gun. What are you, deaf? Drop the fucking gun. The only reason that your alive is I need to know who sent you. - And you know I'm not gonna tell you that. - Oh come on, man, nobody wants to die. Not even some so called professional. Did you kill my brothers? Did you-- (silenced gun firing) You killed me, you motherfucker! Come on, baby, I wanna see you fuck him. (coughing) - Here. - Why are you doing this to me? - It's my job. Now get some sleep. (downbeat music) Here, I thought you should eat something. Look. (beeping) - Thanks. - Leiter here. - Yeah, what is it? - Yeah, here's the deal. Three o'clock, bring the girl in the old parking garage behind the building. - Okay, three o'clock. Bring my money. - Don't worry about it, you'll get your money. Asshole. (water running) - Hey, you need to go to the bathroom? Hey, you need to go to the bathroom? Shit! (dramatic music) - Please, you have to help me, please. Guys, please. There's this guy, he's after me, please! - I don't want any trouble but I'm leaving here with that girl. Why don't you just step aside? Shit. - God, where have you been? - I don't know, I don't know. I was in this cage. I have no idea. This guy, he put me in a cage. - It's okay, you're safe now. - Why he would do this to me? - You're safe, come on. - I don't know, I have no idea what happened. - Okay, okay. I was so worried about you. - I know you don't want me, okay? I know I was a mistake. - It was a mistake and we've gotta talk about this, Celeste. We can't do this anymore, I can't. - But you did and you liked it. - I was very weak and you were so, so-- - So young and vulnerable. - What do you want from me? - I wanna be Mrs. Haskell. - That can never happen. - Yes it can. Yes, we can do it, okay? Yes, we can make it happen. That guy, he can put a gun to her head and make her disappear if you tell him to do it. - Don't talk like that. Please don't talk-- - You are such a selfish bastard, you know? You want everything, you want me and you want her. But I know, I know that you want me more. So I'm just, I'm gonna kill her for you. Come on, Gene, you said it yourself. You're weak, right? So I'll just take care of everything. And this way I can be your wife. - Tell me I'm weak. - [Celeste] You're weak. - I'm weak. - Shut up. - Where is she? Where the fuck is she, what'd you do? Oh no, you didn't fucking kill her. - She got away. - She got away? - [Male] She got away. - The fuck, fuck! Cocksucker, God damn shit, fuck, cunt, fuck! - Settle down. - The fuck am I gonna do now? - I'll find her. - You'll find her. Oh, that's fucking great. Well you better fucking find her because my fucking ass is on the line right now. - Give me a couple of hours. - Fine. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on, I gotta make a fucking phone call. (phone ringing) - [Gene] Haskell. - Yeah, hey, senator, hey. We got a little problem here. - [Gene] She's here. - What, she's there? - Yes. - Good, good. - As a matter of fact, I have something very important for you to do, get over here right away. - Okay. Is this something you're gonna want our boy to take care of. - As a matter of fact, it is, very good idea. I'll see you here in a bit. That was Mr. Leiter. I had my people looking for you everywhere. I was very, very worried. - Wait right here, don't move. Just wait here, I'm gonna bring her back to you. - I thought this was over. - [Leiter] It is for her. - This is gonna cost you. - You just be the mouse. I'll get your cheese. - Now this evening I have a very important fundraiser to attend. So Mr. Leiter is on his way over here and you know what he's gonna do? He's gonna take you shopping to buy you a brand new dress. - I don't need that freak to do anything for me. - Don't worry, honey, I won't even let him speak to you. I'd take you myself but I have to prepare my speech. - [Celeste] Yeah right. - If we're going to be together you're gonna have to trust my judgment. - I can go home with you and wear one of Britney's dresses. - No, I wanna show you off to all my friends in a brand new beautiful dress, not some hand me down. - If I get something really hot you won't be able to take your eyes off me, now will you? - That's the idea, isn't it? - I'm hungry. - Well then we'll have Mr. Leiter stop wherever you want and get you whatever you want to eat. Okay? In the meantime, why don't you get yourself into the bathroom and clean up before he gets here? - Okay. - Senator, everything's taken care of. - Excellent, Mr. Leiter. I'd like you to meet the lovely Celeste. - Oh, Miss Celeste. Pleasure to meet you. I've heard nothing but wonderful things. - Why don't you take her out and get her something to eat and then take her wherever she asks and buy whichever dress she wants. It's for this evening. And Leiter, don't antagonize her. As a matter of fact, don't even speak to her. - I don't think that'll be a problem either. - He'll take good care of you, honey, and I will see you this evening. - Okay. - Miss Celeste, allow me. - Leiter's leaving with the girl. Want me to trail? - [Male] No, you got what we need. Just get the tape over here. - Alright. - Where are we going? - Thought I wasn't supposed to talk to you. - Well I'm asking you a question. Where are we going? - You're just not too fucking bright are you? You know, I tried to give you more credit. I tried to think you were more intelligent. - Just take me to go buy my dress. - Okay, you're not getting no fucking dress. Do you understand? - Okay, you really are just absolutely insane. Can you just take me to go buy my dress? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - This guy does not give a shit about you, young lady. Do you understand that? - Yes he does, Gene cares about me, okay? He loves me! - He doesn't love you, he doesn't give a shit about you. You're the fucking dirt on the bottom of his shoe. That's what you are. - That is so not true. Gene loves me and you better do what he told you to do. - Okay, doing what he told me to do is exactly what I intend to do. Exactly what I intend to do. So fine, I'll do it right now. - Look who it is, shut up! - Hold her! Stupid bitch. - What did you that for? - She's a whore. Get her the fuck out of here. - Now what? - Put her out of her misery. - Hope you've got my money. - Yeah, senator. It's over. - Are you gonna throw me back in the cage? Are you gonna kill me? You know what, I don't care. I don't care, just fucking kill me. You gonna cut my throat? Strangle me? Snap my neck like a twig. (clapping) - Thank you, thank you. Please, take a seat, thank you, thank you, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming this evening. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Please, please, please wait, okay? Alright, look, it doesn't have to be this way, okay? (shouting) - Before we get started, I'd like to talk about a very sensitive subject. Now you folks don't look like the kind of people who believe everything you read. That's why I'd like to address the allegations that have been brought against me by the district attorney's office in his recent indictment. May I say to you from the bottom of my heart it is nothing short of slander. For they have not one shred of evidence. That's why I'm asking them for a hearing as soon as possible so that I may be cleared of these ridiculous and disgusting charges, ladies and gentlemen. And I may get back to my job that I've been doing for the last eight years. And that's representing the wonderful people of this great state. A mission of taking your voice to Washington. A mission that we created together. Haskell is about, about pride. About family. Haskell is about character. And it is my job to listen to your needs and hear your voice and help you make the world a better place for you and your families to live in. (clapping) Now I'm not gonna lie to you running a campaign is very expensive, ladies and gentlemen. And if I'm to continue our mission in taking our voices to capitol hill I'm gonna need your help once again so I'm asking you all to dig deep into your hearts and your pockets and do the right thing, find the generosity to continue the support of our mission. So may I say before I leave, thank you again and God bless each and every one of you. I'll see you in Washington. (clapping) - You don't have to do this. - It's not personal. (silenced gun firing) (silenced gun firing) Should have held it. - The party faithful know the truth about Senator Haskell. Plain and simple. Gentlemen, if you excuse me, nature calls. Please. Oh my God. Haskell. I need help! The senator's been shot! - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Yo, yo, yo, you fucked up, man, you fucked up! What the fuck did you do, man? - It's done. - Yeah it's done, you killed my fucking boss, man! You killed the guy that's been paying you. You owe me, motherfucker! You owe me for this shit! Alright, I'll catch you on the flip side then. Alright, buddy, okay pal? - Well, did you talk to your man? - Oh yeah, of course. It's a done deal. Pretty much, he's got a few priorities he's gotta handle first but don't you worry, judge, everything's gonna be peachy. - Excellent, excellent, well done. - Thank you. - Come on, get in, sit, sit.
