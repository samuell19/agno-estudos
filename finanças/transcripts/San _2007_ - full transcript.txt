Yes sir Zhang Yanfei Yes sir Here's the summary of this week Here's the summary of this week First of all, in terms of ideology There was general stability which rather pleased me Regarding military training as I have participated in the regiment performance I didn't practice much military training I found some unhealthy phenomena has appeared which has never happened before The rice is left uneaten in the plates I've told you that you should take only what you can finish We've mentioned the problem of waste many times Someone threw away buns, did you?

What if it's going to rain? We won't be able to step into the field if it rains No reaping after the rain We grow the wheat, but now we can't even recover the cost when we harvest it We can't recover the cost almost every year You see, if we have harvested and re-planted and then plowed here The income will not cover the cost at all It's not cost-efficient Not so cost-efficient at all Some people left to take on a second job It's just not cost efficient to farm Forget it. Let's reap it while we have the truck It save us some labor The wheat will be useless anyway you can't help 16.9 meters 0.025 Yuan per mu You count it for me. it's OK 47.05 Yuan Give him 5 Yuan Speaking of wheat harvest season let's make a count It will cost 30 Yuan to 40 Yuan to plow 15 is not enough should be 40 to employ labor The seeds cost at least 20 Yuan per mu, right? Then that makes it 60, right? You have to feed the labor You can't ignore the driver who we hired to plow It takes 10 Yuan to water one mu of land How much is it now? 70 Yuan, right? What about the fertilizer? Fertilizer for each mu is at least 70 Yuan Then that makes it 140 Yuan now Aren't there insects as well? People from the agricultural institution were in charge of spreading chemicals some paid for it, but I don't want to If I did, it would cost 20 Yuan for one mu Forget it, we cannot make profit we'll just buy some wheat We are not the kind of folk who can go out and find work What can we do except farm? Farmers are all in the same situation You can't do anything about it It's better to grow corn in August Corn sells better than wheat If corn crop has bad harvest then it's a total waste of a whole year All you leave for yourself is holy hundreds kilogram I am not kidding! If I squeeze the wheat seeds Look at the wheat You know nothing about it See, they all stick together and they won't grow anymore But this is the situation Most of the fields have been harvested what else can you do? Well, the rain is getting heavy now I hope he remember to cover the grains Let's go, Xiaoxia Let's go. Just leave it. Stop! Let's go, it's turning heavy now But they should be covered I'll take this basket with me I'll take it Pull, cover it tightly Pull again, it's long Well, we are not sure about those near the house there is much more wheat over there Oh no, it's not working anymore Just the beginning of the harvest season but we're already done It was too early to finish our harvest It's because it grew up too early The soil here is no good The ground is quite hardscrabble That's what happened here This wheat is all destroyed I was born and raised here We're old-timers in this village I got married around 1965 then it was Cultural Revolution Ah, the cultural revolution ... Let's just skip this long story After the Cultural Revolution there was the job responsibility system The Cultural Revolution started in 1965 The revolution was all over the country in 1966 Then the anti-something started in 1967 What was the situation with Deng Xiaoping? The verdict was overthrown There was the class purifying movement in 1968 System of contracted responsibility started from the last half of '69 Then the contracted system gradually turned up in the late "70s('80s) Then this gradually became “farmland responsibility ” The land was allocated then The central team established professional teams From then on people were responsible for their own farmland After that we had raised melons in this area for some years After the reform initiated by Deng Xiaoping things were peaceful for some time We grew melons for few years Our children were young at that time and Allora I bambini erano ancora piccoli, education fees were rather low at that time Families could afford a few students for a small amount of money Then the “responsibility farmland” emerged After that we are responsible for our own land we really worked hard to afford children's education, many children We work hard, so our life is improved... Then potato flour turned into corn flour From corn flour to pure flour Wheat became popular Living conditions greatly improved Every household has its own story of getting rich or getting poor It's easy to go one way or the other If you want to know about me here, you see I know I've been working too hard My legs and arms hurt a lot It's too many hours out working, I know it's because I'm too tired But you see, we have raised so many kids Anyway they've all gotten married If nothing had happened to my wife if I still tried my best life would still be OK, almost But financially we lag behind Isn't it a common situation in the countryside? It's because you have no income when you get older Younger ones can still go out and find a job Although they don't save money with living standards like that it's no problem getting foods... You see the clothes I'm wearing now were bought over a decade ago When money comes easy you won't hesitate to spend it all So actually, it's still fairly, hard to catch up with others Well, I don't really want to talk about this Speaking of the people in the countryside we were really suffering, really Sometimes when I cook alone I get so damn upset that I weep It's not joke But think about it, this is just... it happens to people Especially the old folks
