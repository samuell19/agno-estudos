I wanted to be in a recon unit, ﻿the best one. ﻿I was summoned for tryouts ﻿and I made it through, which made me so happy. ﻿I was setting out on a new and challenging path. ﻿I felt there ﻿what was hard for me to feel at home. ﻿I felt at home. ﻿I get home at 6 a.m. ﻿I was tired. ﻿was around 6:15, ﻿my father came in on his way to synagogue with his tefilin bag, ﻿I remember that blue bag with the golden letters. ﻿And... he set it aside. ﻿And he said, "I want to talk to you." ﻿Something felt very strange, ﻿my dad wasn't the type to come and talk, ﻿he was an introvert who... ﻿He spoke about technical matters, he didn't talk or share things. ﻿And I felt somewhat tense. ﻿He sat down in front of me. ﻿At first he spoke a little. ﻿And then he... ﻿started touching me. ﻿I remember it vaguely, I remember the heavy breathing. ﻿He touched me like one would touch a woman. ﻿He was being intimate with me. ﻿And I, the big combat soldier, ﻿froze. ﻿I froze for many years. ﻿In the moment of truth ﻿I froze. ﻿I wasn't there. ﻿Only my body was there. ﻿As if my soul had left my body. ﻿Because in that kind of situation ﻿you must be dead. ﻿If you're in there, you must be dead. We arrived in South America ﻿and I was so excited. ﻿My first big trip, alone. ﻿I really opened up, I felt a wall had broken down inside me. ﻿I felt so free and happy, I was having so much fun. ﻿I had totally different plans but I thought: "dump the plans and go with the flow." ﻿I just traveled around, with different people all the time. ﻿I became friends with a girl and we traveled together for a few days. ﻿Then we decided to go to Lima. ﻿We walked out of the central station, looked for a taxi, a taxi drove up, ﻿We drive away, but something's not right. ﻿I say, "I don't think we're in the right direction." ﻿"Something's wrong, let's get out." ﻿We start arguing ﻿and then the taxi suddenly stops. ﻿I blacked out, but she says she heard a boom. ﻿I didn't... ﻿I wasn't there. ﻿It all happened in slow motion, ﻿I turned my head and saw four guys ﻿with their faces all black, ﻿I couldn't see anything, and... ﻿that's it, I blacked out. ﻿We couldn't see anything. ﻿I could just barely see the floor. ﻿They hit me on the head and back, ﻿they grabbed me hard... ﻿We really got beaten up ﻿and then we hear shooting. ﻿Lots of shooting. ﻿She says to me, "Ortal," ﻿"they're gonna kill us, they're gonna murder us." ﻿And I started praying. ﻿I closed my eyes and recited "Hear O Israel." ﻿In Israel there are many PTSD patients. ﻿A state of severe anxiety after being exposed to a traumatic event. ﻿In Israel ﻿unfortunately ﻿there are many terror attacks and wars, road accidents and high-pressure situations, ﻿therefore we have many victims. ﻿we look at the broad picture, ﻿there is no successful treatment for PTSD. ﻿This morning at 8:45 a huge blast rocked downtown Tel Aviv. ﻿A No. 5 bus exploded ﻿on the corner of Dizengoff and Esther Hamalka ﻿it seems a suicide bomber blew himself up. ﻿I heard an explosion, can't explain what I heard. ﻿I saw people running frantically towards Dizengoff Square ﻿and I instinctively ran ahead ﻿to try and save someone. ﻿When you arrive at such a scene ﻿you improvise a tourniquet or something, to save people. ﻿I saw a bus blown into pieces, ﻿people torn apart, ﻿people groaning, calling for help, ﻿I couldn't go in to get them out. ﻿People calling out their last cries, ﻿people groaning to death ﻿and you can't help them. ﻿You're helpless. ﻿People were cut up into pieces, ﻿there was a river of blood. ﻿Some things are inexplainable. ﻿I can't explain what warm blood smells like. ﻿Before that, was a normal human being. ﻿When I got home, I couldn't fall asleep, ﻿I started having nightmares, I was a mess. ﻿I didn't know what I was up against. ﻿After I was exposed to it ﻿I realized.. ﻿how close I was to death. ﻿I stopped working, I quit my job with the ambulance. ﻿It's inappropriate ﻿for an ambulance driver to be mentally ill. ﻿Over the course of time I left my home, my wife, ﻿Over the course of time I left my home, my wife, ﻿my son. ﻿And... ﻿I started living on the street. ﻿I no longer saw myself as a regular person. ﻿I saw myself as an animal trying to survive. ﻿I didn't like myself when I got back. ﻿It wasn't me, I didn't like it. I felt there were two people inside me. ﻿I felt like I was going crazy. ﻿The kidnappers put a black demon inside of me. ﻿The kidnappers put a black demon inside of me. ﻿It's like voices in your head that just... ﻿It's like voices in your head that just... ﻿It doesn't go away, it's like pressure, ﻿as if someone's crushing me like this... ﻿I felt like the only thing that could help is, boom. ﻿I just wanted to stop the pain. ﻿I was a good solider up until that event. ﻿I was very sociable, too, I felt good in my unit. ﻿A week afterwards we had an exercise. ﻿I remember throwing a grenade ﻿without pulling the pin. ﻿So my commander stops the exercise. ﻿What's going on? ﻿Who is that? I don't recognize myself anymore. ﻿A few weeks later I left'the recon unit. I told my commander... ﻿I didn't tell him why, Just that I .wanted to leave. ﻿It's a voluntary unit, ﻿you can up and leave - at any time. I told him 1 wanted to leave ﻿My friends were in shock In the settlement where I grew up, ﻿I know it sounds insane, ﻿but I would walk on the side roads ﻿so that no one would see me. ﻿On the Sabbath I didn't go to synagogue, ﻿I'd pray at the yeshiva library ﻿just to be alone. ﻿So no one would see me. ﻿I wanted to disappear. ﻿I wanted to cease to exist. ﻿For years I was a shadow of my former self. ﻿®n the outside I was great, I laughed, I smiled ﻿but on the inside... I was dying. ﻿I used to wish that I'd be driving ﻿and a truck would come towards me... ﻿Then I wouldn't have to suffer anymore. ﻿I just have to tell you about when I feel... ﻿like that I have no air, don’t I? ﻿It'll pass if you don t focus on it. ﻿You'll go right through it. -Shut up and listen to the music. -Right. ﻿Be relaxed and stop thinking. ﻿I don't know who am I, ﻿am 1 afraid? ﻿The main source of therapy with psychedelic drugs for mental disorders ﻿and primarily drug-assisted psychotherapy was done in the '60s and 70s ﻿at prestigious universities in the U.S. ﻿There were many post-trauma patients ﻿who couldn't be helped with conventional therapy. ﻿And drug-assisted therapy, including Ecstacy or MDMA ﻿created a very exciting infrastructure for both patient and therapist. ﻿That is what attracted me, for the past 20 years, ﻿to all kinds of psychedelic substances ﻿that many of my friends frowned upon, ﻿seriously, they said, "How could a serious, dorky guy like you ﻿"go into this field?" ﻿They said, "If we bring drugs into the hospital, ﻿"how will we watch ever them? What if patients are exposed to them? ﻿"It just doesn't go together." ﻿But I said that it's a controlled substance; ﻿it's kept in a safe, ﻿and the researchers working with it are very serious. ﻿And unlike all the people they turned to in Israel, I said yes. ﻿ ﻿Hello. ﻿I'll turn off my... -Yes, all the devices. ﻿That's it, now I'm here. ﻿I'm Ido. ﻿In the course of time I'll tell you a little more about myself, ﻿I'm open to questions at any time. ﻿I'm sorry, but what is that machine? ﻿It's a blood pressure machine. ﻿It's not recording us? ﻿No, but... -There are two mics up there. ﻿Are you currently on medication? -Yes. ﻿I tried Viepax and such, ﻿but none of the psychiatric meds did any good. ﻿I have very high expectations. ﻿I'm trying to lower them, ﻿I expect to take a pill... ﻿jiuoog ﻿I'll start working ﻿and getting things done. ﻿This is definitely not a pill that you take and it changes your life. ﻿It's part of a therapeutic process. ﻿I'm here because I'm desperate. ﻿I wouldn't be here if I wasn't desperate. ﻿It's a last resort, because it's scary. ﻿It scares me, ﻿the doctor said it wouldn't happen, but it scares me. ﻿That's all there is to it. ﻿What's scary? -That I'll stay here. ﻿That I'll go crazy and stay here. ﻿It scares me that I'll lose control, because... ﻿I've been very much in control since the event ﻿and this will be a serious loss of control. ﻿That I'll try to rape someone or go crazy, and they'll keep me here. ﻿This substance will help you lose control ﻿but in a good way. ﻿but in a good way. ﻿Are you comfortable? ﻿You look a little... -I'm always like this. ﻿Yeah... ﻿It takes a little time. -Want us to tell you a bit? ﻿About us and the research... -Okay. ﻿We have about 90 minutes to get to know each other. ﻿Yes. -To set out on a journey, the three of us. ﻿Right. ﻿The aim of this meeting and two more before the session ﻿in which we'll use the MDMA ﻿is, first of all, ﻿to feel good together, so you'll feel safe with us. ﻿Okay. ﻿Will I leave here, after that night, ﻿the next morning, feeling better or... ﻿What...? ﻿It really depends on how the session goQS for you. ﻿We can't say, ﻿that's part of .the experiment, we can't promise anything. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿The way I see it... ﻿Nachum is in bad shape. ﻿He sleeps all day and is up all night. ﻿He doesn't want to get up for work. ﻿He's very impulsive. ﻿Everything's on my shoulders. ﻿All the responsibility falls on me. ﻿Our livelihood, too. ﻿He'd reach a certain point and then freeze. ﻿He couldn't function. He'd leave, disappear. ﻿No one to talk to. That's it. ﻿Lights out. ﻿Nothing's worthwhile. ﻿There's no love, no nothing. ﻿He doesn't even remember there were good times. ﻿I'd try to convince him, "Look at all the good, ﻿look how much fun we had here, there." ﻿Until I realized it wasn't working. ﻿It didn't help one bit. ﻿Everything's dark. ﻿Even though my dad is now an old man, ﻿I've always been scared to death that there's a murderer inside him ﻿and that he'll murder me. ﻿Isn't a psychiatric hospital a good place to say stuff like that? ﻿It scares me to this day. ﻿It never happened ﻿but where did I come up with that? ﻿It's already gone through metamorphosis, ﻿now I'm afraid that it's inside me, ﻿that it'll come out of me one day, I've lived with this fear for years. ﻿Or scared that I'll do something like that to my daughter. ﻿That, too. -Yes. ﻿Now, who am I afraid of? ﻿I'm only afraid of myself. ﻿I'm afraid... -Yes. -I create... ﻿When I look at your father, ﻿he held out for 19 years without doing anything to you. ﻿Then suddenly... ﻿It came out. -Yes... -That's scary, ﻿maybe I'm just holding out, but... ﻿it could come out, too. ﻿People don't understand, it's not just that person that went through ﻿the trauma, the whole family goes through it, too. ﻿It hurts everyone. ﻿She didn't come back the same happy daughter that she once was. ﻿She... She cried all the time... ﻿When you spoke to her, you could tell she just wanted to roll up into a ball and... ﻿go away. ﻿There was lots of yelling, ﻿throwing things. ﻿Locking herself up in her room ﻿without talking to anyone. ﻿Saying things that parents don't want to hear, "Too bad they didn't kill me, ﻿"then I wouldn't suffer like this." ﻿It hurts a mother's heart to hear those things. ﻿I slept outside her closed door. ﻿There were days when she refused to open the door. ﻿So I'd sit there all night and knock on the door ﻿just to hear her say, "Go away!" or... ﻿Anything, it didn't matter what. ﻿When you say you're fed up, ﻿what do you mean? ﻿Do you think about death, that you're fed up with life or...? -Yes. ﻿I took Cipralex and then I drank a bucket of alcohol. ﻿I don't remember anything aside from finding myself... ﻿in bed, in a clinic. ﻿They said that I fainted and started convulsing, ﻿foaming at the mouth, vomiting, so they took me there. ﻿I can't handle it anymore. ﻿I can't, because... ﻿you reach the end of the tunnel ﻿and then there's something else. ﻿You don't reach the end, you see the light... ﻿you want to reach it, but you can't. ﻿So I'm tired of it. ﻿I feel you're a bit reserved today. -Yes. ﻿Yes, because... ﻿this is the last meeting before... ﻿before the meeting... ﻿With the substance itself. ﻿We're here, you're not alone. ﻿I suffer from self-hatred. ﻿I've lived with it for years, ﻿self-criticism that turned into self-hatred. ﻿It'll be very hard for me... ﻿to encounter that. ﻿I've never experienced love, ﻿not even with my wife or in previous relationships. ﻿Intimacy, those are things I find intriguing, ﻿I'd like to experience them. ﻿I'd like to see beyond the Mountains of Darkness. ﻿The post-trauma is the unpredictable encounter ﻿with your helplessness. ﻿It's a horrible feeling, ﻿because it dismisses your earlier conceptions that you have control over your life. ﻿The drug creates a temporary cognitive and emotional state ﻿that enables the patient, who normally wouldn't let you touch the pain, ﻿but when you give him MDMA, he feels comfortable. ﻿Like a sea of relaxation and a desire to set out on an inner journey. ﻿We have water, right here. ﻿You just take it. ﻿Good luck. -Good luck. -Cheers. -Cheers. ﻿Shall I put on some music? -Yes. ﻿This is amazing. ﻿There's something amazing here. ﻿When I was looking at that picture before, ﻿I saw a lion and it scared me. ﻿I saw lions [arayot] ﻿which made me think of the word "arayot" ﻿which also means "incest." ﻿Now I see a horse with a girl, a woman inside it. ﻿That's nice. -Very nice. ﻿That difference in the images is interesting, ﻿because horses may symbolize freedom. ﻿Horses symbolize freedom very much to me, and high school. ﻿It makes me think of a photo ﻿that I have in a photo album. ﻿I went to a yeshiva high school in the Golan Heights ﻿and I worked a lot with horses, ﻿with cattle. ﻿I rode horses a lot ﻿and you really do feel freedom. I dream of riding horses again. ﻿After many feminine years, I have to go back to... ﻿Your masculinity. ﻿Yes, to masculine domains. -Yes. ﻿To see the beauty of masculinity. ﻿The power of masculinity. ﻿The positive sides of the lion. -Yes. ﻿That turns into a horse. A noble horse. ﻿It feels as if two people are wrestling inside me. ﻿Feel them wrestling there. ﻿Something spiritual and weak against something animal-like and strong. ﻿Just let them be. ﻿Like an ape, a gorilla, something very animal-like and violent. ﻿be with the gorilLet's not be afraid of it. ﻿Let that gorilla live in your body. ﻿What kind of sound does it make? ﻿What does it do with its hands? ﻿Let's do it together. ﻿Now I hear a voice saying, "Careful! ﻿"You'll end up doing that to your daughter ﻿and you'll scare her." She's scared of me. ﻿That's the wrestling. ﻿It's actually very much alive. -What? ﻿What you just expressed. -Yes. ﻿It won't break out at your daughter. -Right. ﻿Now you have control of it. ﻿Right. It's amazing. ﻿Are you in any pain? -Yes. ﻿How will you feel if I hold you little? ﻿I feel as if my faucet has been opened, ﻿pure water is coming through. ﻿There's movement. ﻿There's change. ﻿As if the hose was turned off for years. ﻿And it opened up here. ﻿It feels good. ﻿It's flowing. ﻿I feel it all over my body. ﻿I'm tired of it. ﻿This trauma messed ﻿When I leave here today, I'll go home and I'll be all alone and I'll cry. ﻿I'm tired of it. ﻿Are you afraid to go home? ﻿I just don't want to be alene. ﻿Move ahead! ﻿Tell me! Where did you put the money? ﻿Where is the money? ﻿Tell me! ﻿Where did you put the money? ﻿Where is the money? ﻿Where did you put the money? ﻿Where is the money? ﻿Tell me! ﻿Where is the money? ﻿Please, stop! Stop! ﻿I don't know what came out of yesterday. ﻿I think you remember more. -Yes. ﻿No, I remember, I was just... ﻿No/l remember, I was just... ﻿expecting something else. -I see. -Yes. ﻿I thought it would... ﻿bring it out differently. -I see. ﻿You didn't run away. ﻿You told us, you started off by telling ﻿and you remembered more details of the story. ﻿There were plaees you didn't want to go, and that made you suffer. ﻿you said, "I don't like being here," ﻿and that's when there was a struggle. ﻿I thought about it after, in the morning, that... ﻿during... ﻿the kidnapping my brain was working so hard and my body was frozen, ﻿so now my body needs to let it all out ﻿because I was holding it in so hard. -Exactly. ﻿because I was holding it in so hard. -Exactly. ﻿It's as if your body froze in that place ﻿and as far as it's concerned, the trauma isn't over, ﻿you're still there. ﻿And yesterday, your body started letting go, ﻿as far as your body is concerned, the kidnapping happened yesterday. ﻿I'd never taken Ecstasy, MDMA or any other drug. ﻿And.. ﻿I was very apprehensive. ﻿Terribly frightened. ﻿Are you nervous? ﻿I'm going into the unknown. ﻿There are casualties in the back of the bus ﻿You avoid going there you avoid remembering. ﻿Where did you take it to? ﻿To extreme self-punishment and giving up on life. ﻿You were among the first to arrive, ﻿you should be proud of what you did, of the people you saved. ﻿I never saved anyone, I've never been at a scene of an attack. ﻿May you never be there. ﻿You should be proud of what you did, ﻿but you're not proud of it. ﻿During the treatment ﻿there were things that.. ﻿I saw, I encountered. ﻿I saw myself ﻿back in time. ﻿I turned back into the young man who was a medic and an ambulance driver who ran ahead. ﻿There was something... ﻿something strange ﻿It was the first time I ever felt as if I were floating. ﻿I was right above the area itself. ﻿It's as if I'm there, but I'm not. Like a ghost. ﻿I felt... ﻿extremely self-confident. ﻿I experienced something ﻿that I can't even explain. ﻿My brain had been numb, ﻿covered in dust ﻿and the MDMA waxed it and polished it. ﻿What happened isn't my fault. ﻿I couldn't have prevented ﻿what happened, I couldn't have'taken better action, ﻿That's what I'm working on in my head. ﻿My father wasn't at home much. ﻿He was mostly at the yeshiva, ﻿studying Torah, praying, ﻿even when he came home, he'd read ﻿and study. ﻿I remember him praying. ﻿As a boy, I'd watch him pray, ﻿he was so excited, jumping up and down. ﻿And it scared me to death. ﻿Everyone used to say, "What a righteous man," ﻿but I felt as if... ﻿I didn't want it. ﻿I didn't feel good or righteous. ﻿I didn't know where that volcano came from. ﻿I couldn't understand how within that quietness, ﻿that introverted nature ﻿such a volcano of anger could erupt. ﻿such a volcano of anger could erupt. ﻿PTSD patients live their entire lives ﻿trying to. protect themselves from any reminders. ﻿They're in flight their whole life. ﻿They're saying, "Never again." ﻿We use a drug that brings you closer to yourself, ﻿you get the opportunity to reprocess the trauma. We give people a second chance. ﻿Another chance to fight and to win. ﻿I'm having a hard time with who I see. ﻿A very hard time. ﻿I'm having a hard time with who I see. ﻿Who do you see? ﻿I see a man who's lazy, frightened. ﻿Someone who has failed. ﻿A lazy, frightened failure. ﻿Cruel to his family and to himself. ﻿I hate that Nachum whose father hurt him. ﻿He doesn't deserve anything. ﻿He doesn't deserve love if that's how he was treated. ﻿He must be... ﻿like an object. ﻿I struggle for that boy, I struggle for my life. ﻿I can't struggle anymore. ﻿Enough. ﻿Enough. ﻿Enough. ﻿Enough. ﻿Enough. ﻿Enough with all this struggling. ﻿I struggle with the whole world. ﻿I struggle with my wife. ﻿I struggle with my children. ﻿I struggle with myself. ﻿I feel like letting my neck tear off... ﻿Want me to hold your head? -No. ﻿Would you like a pillow back there? -No, I want it to be torn off. ﻿Okay. Let it be like that. ﻿Let that feeling be. ﻿What if the depression deesn't come out today? ﻿Whatever needs to happen will happen, we're here. ﻿I have so many things inside my head, I feel mentally ill. ﻿You can move... -This is not fun. ﻿What is coming out of me? ﻿It doesn't feel good. -No. ﻿It doesn't feel good. ﻿It doesn't feel good. -Move with that. ﻿Why does it have to come out like this? -There is no answer. ﻿But how did it get in there? ﻿I was kidnapped, how did it get in there? ﻿Why don't my body and mind work together? Why are they separate? ﻿Let all those questions echo inside you. ﻿More questions and things ﻿will come up, just let all that be. ﻿I want to shoot myself in the head. ﻿I want to shoot it. I want it to be quiet. ﻿Why can't it be quiet? ﻿You want to quiet your brain, you want to disengage from your body. ﻿I don't want to feel my body, I want to disengage from my head ﻿but it won't leave me alone. ﻿Why won't it leave me alone? ﻿Try to figure what its role is. ﻿My head is stupid, I just want to die. ﻿I want to shoot it, I don't want to die. ﻿I want my body to live and my brain to die. ﻿I don't want it. -To tear your head off, yes. ﻿I don't want it! ﻿Let your legs work, ﻿let your body do whatever it wants. ﻿Let yourself feel your body the way you want to be in contact with it. ﻿I feel like my body is floating 3 meters above myself. ﻿3 meters. ﻿Can you see what happens if you lower yourself 30 cms? ﻿I'm in the room where my father hurt me. ﻿Okay. ﻿Be there and see. ﻿What do you see? ﻿Everything's blurry. ﻿It really scares me. ﻿Right now I'm scared to death of my father. ﻿You're scared to death of your father. ﻿Take it nice and slow. ﻿We're here with you and there's the fear of your father. ﻿How do you feel in the room with your father there? ﻿I want to tell him clearly that he shouldn't do that. ﻿He shouldn't do that. ﻿No. ﻿No, no, don't do that. ﻿No, I don't agree. ﻿No, I don't agree. ﻿I do not consent. ﻿I do not consent. I do not agree. ﻿No, no, don't do that. ﻿And now the wind's hand extends without a sound ﻿Suddenly a window opens in the night ﻿Why are your laughter and your fear so strongly bound? ﻿And tell me, why is it you freeze so happily? ﻿You say you'll always be a stranger in this land ﻿And fire and water spy on you from every side... ﻿That's it. ﻿That's it. ﻿Now I understand. ﻿It's allowing myself to love. To just love. ﻿Instead of trying to be loved and flattered. ﻿My whole life I was preoccupied with being loved. ﻿But the solution is in loving. ﻿It's there, I know it, it's in loving. ﻿I can't believe I did it, what an idiot... ﻿They gave me my bag back ﻿and I opened the zipper ﻿without seeing anything, without seeing who was watching ﻿and I took out my credit card and hid it in my bra. ﻿Then I closed the zipper and put my bag down, ﻿what an idiot! I can't see who's watching, I can't see anything. ﻿Fortunately, they didn't get it. ﻿And this is with your head covered? ﻿Yes, my body was functioning. ﻿Yes, it had... ﻿A minute later they took my bag ﻿and I was sure they saw that, but they didn't. ﻿Where's the money? ﻿And then she says to me, "Ortal, they're really stressed out." ﻿I said, "Tell them I'm sick with salmonella ﻿"and we're on our way to the hospital in Lima ﻿"and that I lost my credit card so my mom's waiting for us. ﻿"My mom is waiting for us in Lima at the hospital ﻿"so they should let us go." ﻿She told them, maybe that's why they let us go. ﻿Try to imagine the kidnappers, ﻿let's say they were little and were right here, ﻿you can get mad at them now. ﻿What do yeiti say to them? ﻿I want to keep away from them. ﻿I don't want to talk to them. ﻿Get rid of them. ﻿I'll get rid of them. ﻿I don't want to look at them. ﻿You don't want any contact. -Goodbye, leave me alone. ﻿Okay. -Okay. ﻿Can I give you a hug, too? -That would be great. ﻿Want to look at yourself in the mirror, Nachum? ﻿Let's try. ﻿I haven't looked at myself in years. ﻿I don't dare look at myself and see that it's me. ﻿That I deserve a lot of love and compassion. ﻿My God ﻿The soul You have given me ﻿It is pure ﻿My God ﻿The soul You have given me ﻿It is pure ﻿You created it, You formed it and You breathed it into me ﻿And You guard it while it is within me ﻿And one day You will take it from me ﻿Amd restore it to me in the time to come ﻿As long as the soul is within me ﻿I will thank You ﻿As long as the soul is within me ﻿I will thank You ﻿My God and God of my ancestors... ﻿I allow myself to see a smile. ﻿I allow myself to see a smile. ﻿Its real. ﻿Lord of all souls ﻿Master of all works ﻿Lord of all souls ﻿I really want to be with my wife now. ﻿For her to be with me. ﻿To sit together and look each other in the eyes. ﻿it feels good. ﻿They see everything I've endured and they're pr@ud ©f me. ﻿PTSD is a brain disease ﻿and MDMA works in the brain. ﻿Everything happens in the brain. ﻿In the brain we feel, we love, we get disappointed, ﻿we yearn. ﻿It's hard to comprehend the wonders of the human brain. ﻿This experiment is also proof that if you can activate the brain properly ﻿you can create situations that will help the body heal. ﻿And help the brain heal. ﻿How long have you not lived at home? ﻿How long have you not lived at heme? ﻿A decade. -It's been 10 years? ﻿So when you broke up, the boy was a year old? -Reughly. ﻿Oh, okay. ﻿But were you in touch with him? ﻿I was in touch with him, ﻿I'd do anything to keep in touch with him. ﻿Did he see you with the beard? ﻿How did he react? ﻿Did he see you unbathed, in dirty clothes? ﻿I wasn't proud of that. ﻿Did you tell him what was going on with you? ﻿Or about the bombings you'd seen? ﻿Does he know about that? ﻿I didn't share anything with him. ﻿You never told him? -Never. ﻿Why didn't you ever open up to him? ﻿I don't want him to get hurt. ﻿He's hurt enough. ﻿Daddy*.. ﻿You asked earlier ﻿what I benefited from the MDMA. ﻿What... ﻿What's the biggest help I got out of if? ﻿my son were here ﻿he'd say that... ﻿he got his father back, a father who wasn't there before. ﻿Today, two years later, ﻿I got custody of my son from the welfare serviees. ﻿I'm raising my son. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Thank you very much. -Welcome to Israel. ﻿I felt like I went through 15 years of psychological therapy in one night. ﻿I remember driving up ﻿towards Neve Daniel, then down here, I felt ﻿I was coming home. ﻿I really felt I was finally coming home. ﻿Human being ﻿Keep climbing up ﻿Keep climbing up, human being ﻿Keep climbing up ﻿For you have tremendous strength ﻿You have wings of spirit ﻿You have wings of spirit, wings of noble eagles ﻿Do not deny them ﻿Or they will deny you ﻿Seek them... ﻿This is a poem I wrote a few weeks after the session. ﻿It's called "Sunrise." ﻿It describes the process of what the... ﻿healing does, the medicine. ﻿The MDMA. ﻿"Sunrise. ﻿"Look beyond the beauty. ﻿"Glimpse beyond the face. ﻿"Gaze deep inside. ﻿"There, here, black gold wraps, drips. ﻿"There, here, precious resources are quarried from the deep darkness. ﻿"And among the acacias of horror, anxiety, fury ﻿"Plowed soil, determined to be fertile, opens up. ﻿"Remarkable furrows spread across the wide open space ﻿"And above them on the third watch ﻿"stands the man and reads." ﻿Thank you. ﻿What did you feel? -I felt it was for me. ﻿Hope. -Yes. ﻿A new path. ﻿I see the poem moved you. ﻿It moves me that you're moved. ﻿What? ﻿It also makes the pain in this package... ﻿surface. ﻿When there's hope, it also makes you... ﻿remember the hopelessness. ﻿About despair and hard times. ﻿You can't just put all the... ﻿hard times behind and say, that's it, they're behind us. ﻿They're with ﻿And they're ahead of us. ﻿But it's okay. ﻿We're ready. ﻿Maybe. ﻿Keep going, ﻿you're going crazy... ﻿I have a very hard time with the word "kidnapping." ﻿It's that split-second that changes your entire life. ﻿The only think I remember from the blackout is... ﻿the bloodcurdling scream that the girl I was with let out... ﻿Just today I was talking about my first MDMA session, ﻿the first time the MDMA affected me, the first thing I did was scream. ﻿I really like this poem ﻿because it's all about freedom. ﻿It's called "I am a Jew That's Been Converted," it'll be in my next book. ﻿Page 9. ﻿"I am a Jew that's been converted to freedom ﻿"Converted to refreshed thinking ﻿"I am a Jew that's been converted to a question mark ﻿"That's been converted with an exclamation mark ﻿'Tm converted to loneliness ﻿"Lone but not alone ﻿"Converted to something else. ﻿That is what I am submitting to you." ﻿I write as an Israeli poet and as a former victim of sexual abuse. ﻿I chose to stand here and read my poems, to say loud and clear ﻿that the discourse on sexual abuse in Israel is changing. ﻿So are we. ﻿The victims, the abused, must make a change, but a different change. ﻿First and foremost we must stop being victims. ﻿As someone who felt like a victim and learned to let it go, ﻿I know it's possible. ﻿And most important - we must learn to forgive, both ourselves ﻿and whoever abused us. ﻿To forgive without forgetting what happened, ﻿to forgive in order to heal ourselves from the grudge and guilt ﻿inside of us. ﻿Thank you. ﻿What you said is so true. ﻿What? -That you were abused ﻿but you don't keep it to yourself, you tell the world about it. ﻿That you acknowledge it and don't hide it. ﻿That's how you feel? -Yes. ﻿It's great to hear that. ﻿But you were always sweet. -It's great to hear. ﻿You look different. ﻿Yes. ﻿Oh. ﻿I'm feeling very emotional, too. ﻿It's an emotional moment. ﻿I can't. -Okay, take your time. ﻿It looks like a lot of fog has cleared. ﻿Or dust. i You look more rational. ﻿Yes. -Sharper. ﻿All right. -Okay. ﻿I am, yes. ﻿Someone asked, "Are you off the meds?"
