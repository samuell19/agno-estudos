(soft mysterious music) - [Chris] Fuck. (soft mysterious music) - Hey, check it out. What do we do with it? We got him with possession, right? - Keep looking. You got to find something with a name on it. A bill, a magazine, a prescription bottle, indicia. Something to prove ownership. Ah, ah, ah ah ah. - Fuck. - Keep looking. The roach was the hard part. - Fuck, this is some bullshit. (soft mysterious music) Jackie Maylum. Fucking got him, right? - Do you know what this is? This, and this, gives us cause for a search of Mrs. Maylum's house. In service of that search, we can seize assets we believe were used for or acquired through illegal activity, like the sale and distribution of a controlled substance. Eh? They got cellphones, we'll take those. Cars? Not anymore, those are ours now too. And all that goes right into our operating budget. Nobody had to fire a shot. If you do this job right, there's no cowboy shit at all. Good work, kid. Dump that shit. Let's get out of here. (soft mysterious music) (phone ringing in distance) - Where the hell have you been? You waste all your goddam time picking trash when you ought to be hitting the phones. What took you guys so fucking long? What's this? The state's attorney is just going to jizz himself over this one, fellas. - That was in your trash. - I got a prescription. For my headaches. I got low appetite. - Low appetite, please. - Very funny. This is just a fucking goldmine, Chris, nice work. - Give him a break. It's for the kid's first case. - And it might be his last. Get to dialing. Maybe you'll have better luck on the phones. Now I'm going to go jerk off over this epic weed seizure, and I need the deal ready to serve by six. I want to get out of this fucking office today. I feel cooped up. - Hey, I got a proposition for you, my man. Look, dude, you owe me. You don't want to make a quick $50. - What's up, man, what are you doing? Family reunion? Seriously? - All right, it's 40 bucks now because you're talking back to me. - Yo, J, what up, man, what are you doing? Hey, you want to make some money today? Who you got? - Will he sell to me? What's he holding, teeners? I don't know, Dumb and White. Doesn't have to be me, it's all the same, all right? All right. 20 minutes, same cut? All right, I'm going to go down, pick up J, bring him back here to get the ball rolling, okay? All right, hang tight. - Hey, Rook? - Yeah. - Mikey? - Yep. - [Chris] You coming? It's up. - Yeah. - I know, I know. - He's a toddler. He's like a tall toddler. - [Chris] Yeah, I know, I know. - He's like Tom Hanks from "Big." (laughing) - So you're J? - Yeah, I'm J. - I'm Mikey. - [Chris] Come on now, J. Go easy on him, all right? No no no. First thing you got to do is have him empty his pockets. (chattering) All right, let's go. Turn around, brother. Open your mouth. You always got to check the mouth. What's this? Come on now. Paraphernalia. Going to let him hang onto it, because it plays. - [J] Yeah yeah yeah. - Because it's J and we love J. - [J] Everybody loves J. Hey, hey, hey! - Tony! - Junkie J, my man. - Brother man, what's going on? Damn, man. - [Anthony] Doing all right. So you still hyping? - All right, so we got a little money. This is deal money, right? Take a look. - [J] That's all the money I got? - Yeah, man, you got 50 bucks. That's plenty, man. - That's plenty? That's $10. - That's what you told me. Oh, come on, man, it's like 50 bucks. J, come on, get out of here. - Can I see it? - No, no no no. - I'm just saying. - You're going to be on the eye with Jim. You'll see everything going down, and he'll fill you in on, and then we'll touch base. - Pow, pow, pow. - I been wanting to get to know each other. - No, see, you aint cool enough to be in the streets. (laughing) - You're my guy. I need you, man. - If I find out something else, I'll most definitely tell you. - That's cool. - You're going to hook me up with cash, right? - You know it. All right, buddy. I'll be watching. - Okay. - Be ready, and I'll come back and get you. If anything looks funny, I'll bust up there and shut it down, okay? - All right. - All right. Here we go, and I'm going to pick you up right here, too, okay? - All right, watch my back now. - I got you. - Okay. - Just dropped off J. Corner of Sixth and Monroe. I got the eye. - Copy that. So how's it going with Chris? - [Mikey] He's cool. - Yeah? - Learning a lot. - But slower than shit, right? - Yeah. - Not what you expected? It'll pick up. - Chris is ... - What? - Never mind, nothing. - Hey, trust your gut. You want to say something, say it. - Chris has been here a long time, right? Guys I know use this job to move on or move up, to make detective. I'm just wondering why he's still here. - What Chris does, making sure the trains run on time, nobody getting hurt, he does better than anybody. It suits him. But, Chris has figured out a few angles to help himself. Definitely listen to him. He'll teach you how to stay alive. But, you and him help each other Mikey. I, I don't like saying this. But Chris, he's not who you think he is. I need you to keep an eye on him. - I'm not a snitch. - Fair enough, but I got an open door. You see something from him that doesn't sit right with you, I want you to come to me. I'm serious about this. I want you to come to me. (soft mysterious music) - Picking up J, heading back to the shop. Did you get it? - Yeah. - It's good, buddy. It's good. How'd it go? - It went good. It went okay. - Yeah, you know those guys? - I met him one time before, some local kid. I think he copping from somebody big. I just don't know who it is. (soft mysterious music) - See here. He's bringing him in now. - Okay. - Yeah. - He's taking a precaution. See, the thing is, what you do is you keep control. He's just patting him down. Even though he knows what he's going to find, he's doing this to some extent just to show J who's boss. Now he's going to look in his mouth. - Okay. - [Jim] Yeah, there you go. - [Mikey] Yeah. - [Chris] Is he new to town, or is he passing through? You got any idea where he might be coming from? - Got one positive. [Chris] No? - Mm-mm, mm-mm. - All right, all right. All right, man, we're going to check a couple boxes and be right back. - [J] All right, man, don't hang me up here like you did last time. - [Chris] All right, all right. - [J] Thought I was going to die. - Colors have changed, so that's positive for change. - He's extra-twitchy today, huh? What do you got there, positive? - [Anthony] Yes, sir, positive on both. - There you go, all right. Right on. Man, he's shaking bad. - All right, Chris, good work. Except you know what? You've upset him so much. - [Chris] What are you talking about? He's my favorite guy. - [Jim] That was damn close to police brutality, Chris. Goddammit, do you see how nervous you made him? - All right, man, you got some money? I'm going to pay him out, get him out of here. - Hopefully he goes and gets something to eat with it. - Right. Hey, speaking of food, my Aunt Jackie called. She have the neck bones, sweet potatoes, you down? - Oh yeah, I'm down. - [Anthony] My man. All right, black-eyed peas? - I like it, I like it. - [Jim] How about some neck bones for Daddy-o? - Mind your business. - What do you think, huh? Lot of fun, eh? - [Mikey] Yeah, yeah. - And you meet such nice people in this line of work. - [Mikey] Right. (phone ringing) (copier whirring) - Chris, Mikey? Hey, let me see you a minute. (phone ringing) - [Chris] Got your designer Depends on, I see. - You know, you're getting way too much gray in that beard to give me that kind of shit. - Gray is hip, man, it's hip. - Whoever heard of a narc with a gray beard? (laughing) Shut the door. Silvis PD has asked for our help with a house they've had their eye on. They want us to lend them a UC to assist. - Who do you want me to talk to? - I want Mikey to be their contact. You'll lead the surveillance team. He'll still be training with you, but he's also be working with me and the CS to set up the deal inside the house. - What the fuck are you doing, man? - [Mikey] Chris, I got this. - Shut up. - A lot of planning has already gone into this, Chris, and you're an important part of that. But right now the focus has got to be on getting him ready. Can you handle that? - You running this thing like a dictatorship now? Pulling the curtain back? We talk about this shit, man, behind closed doors. - Let's just say it's my call. I want the kid on this, and I want you to get him in and out. - We need to talk about this, man. - [Jim] We're up in two days. - Come on, dickhead. - [Chris] What piece you got. - [Mikey] PPK. - Set your phone to record and keep it handy. We'll be listening. - I know. - Listen, probably feels like it's happening fast, right. Like you can't stop it. I've been there. We can still shut it down. It's okay. We're only doing this if you feel ready. - I'm good. - I'm only saying that because it's easier to shut it down now than when you're in there. - I know what I need to know. - Ready? - Yeah. - All right. - Listen, if the dude tries to drag it out in any way, press him, threaten to walk. He'll stop you if he wants the deal. Don't reach for the bag. Got it? If anything feels wrong, I'll shut it down and we'll take the house, okay? When you see us, just act dumb and white, right? Don't think. If you do the job, no need to worry. Plus, they can only kill you once. Know what I mean? All right. (soft mysterious music) - Okay, fellas, there's our hero. (soft mysterious music) - Hey, what's up, man? - Somebody talk to you, about 15 minutes ago? Come on in. - [Mikey] How you doing? - [Slim] Wait, wait here. Sit down over there, man. - [Mikey] All right. - [Slim] So what you need? - [Mikey] What do you have? - [Slim] Whatever you need? That's it. - [Mikey] Did I just hear something back there? - [Slim] No, no, don't worry about all that, man. Hey, don't worry about who's here. All right. Just get your stuff, man and-- (soft mysterious music) - Anthony, I just lost the kid's wire. - [Anthony] I lost it too. Let me check something. Stand by. - [Chris] House looks fine, but I got nothing with the wire. Can you get it back up? - [Anthony] I got nothing but green lights over here. It must be on Mikey's end. (soft mysterious music) - [Chris] Got suspect exiting the house. (soft suspenseful music) Looks like Goldy. - [Anthony] Copy that. - [Chris] He's heading to the street, for Mikey's car. Unit three, get ready to go. - [Anthony] He's taking the car? - Call it into Jim, and let's get another unit to pick up the follow. Mikey's still inside. Wire's still shit. - [Anthony] Fuck. Calling it in now. - We still have a recorder in that car, Anthony? - [Anthony] Yeah, that's right. - [Chris] Turn it on. I want to hear what he has to say. - [Anthony] Copy that. (soft suspenseful music) Unit two, we're taking the house. - [Anthony] Copy that, taking the house. (soft suspenseful music) - Oh, shit. - [Chris] Don't move. Drop that gun right now! - Chris, what the fuck? It's cool, be cool! - What the fuck? Shut the fuck up! Drop that gun right now! - What the fuck, man? You set me up? Look, you set me up? - Drop your weapon, asshole! Drop it right now! - Be cool! What the fuck? [gun Firing] [guns Firing] - Clear left. - I got kitchen. (soft mysterious music) [guns Firing] - Kitchen clear? - Kitchen clear! - Shooter in the back! - This is great. The guy's got a motherfucking AK. [gun firing Rapidly] - Davis, go around, see if you can find an angle on him. Anthony, high low? - Copy. (soft suspenseful music) [gun firing Rapidly] [gun Firing] (soft suspenseful music) [guns Firing] (soft suspenseful music) - All right, clear. Left side. (soft suspenseful music) Clear? - [Anthony] Clear. Room clear. - Room clear. Okay, man, breathe. Just breathe. - What the fuck are you doing? It was just a meet. - Get an ambulance! Ah God. (soft suspenseful music) [siren blaring] (soft suspenseful music) - [Anthony] Chris. Chris. Chris. You all right, man? - Yeah, I'm good. - I came over here because the units found the UC car Goldy drove off with. It was ditched, no Goldy. - What was the weight? - 30 keys. I downloaded the recorder from the car. You'll want to hear it. - Play it. - [Goldy] --some smokes. Yeah, ain't going to take me too long. I'll be there in a minute. Come on, man, I already told you, bruh. That's Kewanee shit, nigger. That's all you need to know. This is the purest, bro. You could step on this shit a million fucking ways, and I promise you, it's still going to hit. Kewanee, nigger. You going to see, I'm coming to you right now, bruh. - That's everything. - He's talking to a distributor. - Mm-hm. - I'm going to find J, about Kewanee. [phone Buzzing] - [Anthony] I'll talk to you later. - [Jim] How you feeling? - I'm good. - [Jim] Listen, a couple of things. ISP just sent me counselor info for you. I'm emailing it now. Anything you need while you're out, call me or them, either one, okay? - Okay. - [Jim] Second thing, DII wants to do its interview with you soon. Nothing set yet. I'll let you know as soon as I hear. But I want you to stay at home until-- - Yeah, we need to talk. Before DII. - [Jim] Yeah, yeah, but right now I just want you to-- - I'm not sitting with them until we talk. And we've got to find Goldy. And we need to talk to your Silvis guy. It's bigger than that now. - [Jim] Chris, I'm going to scour the fucking Earth for Goldy, but I don't have a unit without you. If we don't do this by the book, DII is going to suspend you and then we're really fucked. So just, just take this time. - All right. - [Jim] Look, I saw that scene. You need this. Looked like a good shoot. You're going to be back as soon as you're ready, okay? But until then you just chill. I'll call you again in a little while. You hang in there, brother. - Okay. - [J] Hey, yo Chris, man, it's your favorite Junkie J. I just got your text. I need this paper, yo, for real, for real. Later. - [J] He decided to make his play. - [Chris] Play, against who? - No, I ain't doing this. No fucking way, man. - I'm not asking questions anymore. Tell me about Kewanee. - Just charge him with whatever you got. Forget about what he said. Get him with something with the car and get on to the next one. - Not going for your boogeyman bullshit today, man. - Look, you're forgetting about the game. Take what you got. You trying to climb the ladder with this? Get the guy, roll him up to the next guy till you go all the way up to the fucking cartel of the month? Just bust his ass. He might give you somebody else. But just play it like always. We work for you, you bust the next guy, he does some time, then he's working for you. You bust me, I do some time, and I'm back working for you. But just keep it going, motherfucker. I like consistency. I mean it ain't perfect, but that's how we do it. Right? Right? - Mikey died for this shit. - Aw, man. People out here dying every day, you see this. - Give me one name in Kewanee, and you're done. - Man, you said you wanted Goldy, now you reneging off the shit. - And I want Kewanee. Kewanee. - Listen, I give you the Westchester Vacants. Goldy's probably there. Lots of people hide out there. Go to the Vacants, go find him, that's it, that's all. - Westchester Vacants? Please. You want to be found with a hot dose in your arm? Locked door, everybody thinks you finally did it, Jerrod? Kewanee. - Damn. Clayton's Club. That's all. (soft mysterious music) [birds singing] (soft mysterious music) [gun Clicking] (soft mysterious music) [door bell Tinkling] - Coffee? - Yeah. - You look familiar. Do I know you? - I don't think so. [phone buzzing] - Stay put, I'm not done with you. Hey. (mumbling) (soft music) [men Laughing] [door bell Tinkling] (soft music) - Hey, Jo. - What's up, Manny? - Hey, where you going? - No no, no no no. [punches striking] [man groaning] - Put your hand back on the counter. Did you get a chance to look at the menu? [punches striking] - No, I'm good with just the coffee. - Okay, let me know if you change your mind. - Get his ass up. Get him to a hospital. Keep his head steady. (soft music) (door bell tinkling) (moaning) - Mind if I give you the check? My shift's almost over. - Sure. - You think I should call the police? - Don't do it on my account. - Why not? - If you had to ask, you probably weren't going to do it anyway. - I'm headed to my other job. I tend bar at Clayton's. You should stop by. I'll get you your first drink. - It's a deal. (soft music) [doorbell tinkling] (soft mysterious music) [Velcro tearing] (soft mysterious music) [door creaking] - Put your hands up. You're good. Get outta here. [patrons chattering] - What can I get you? - Is it still on the house? - Why not? - I'll take a bourbon. Why did you ask me if you should call the cops? - Isn't the customer always right? Not everybody's okay with that kind of attention. The kid's friends came, picked him up. The place was quiet afterwards. You were cool, I was cool. - The sight of that kid's blood didn't bother you? - It's not really the first time I've seen something like that, to be honest with you. (rock music playing in the bar) - What's all this? - [Jolene] I know you're carrying. Hughes just wants to have a word. - Hughes? This his place? - He won't keep you. - I could just leave. It's not a problem. - Just talk to him. (rock music playing in the bar) - [Hughes] Close the door behind you and lock it. [door closing] Now could you please take that pistol in your jacket pocket and put it on my desk? - Why didn't you just have your guy take it off me? - Well, if I had asked Diddley about it, he'd tell me that he had checked you out. Then I'd have to embarrass him a little in front of everybody, saying that he missed it. He'd feel disrespected. And if he didn't let that go, we'd have a full-on beef. You see, it's been my experience that if you give someone respect 100, they give it back you in return. So if I call him out, I lose his trust. And then I don't know what he's going to do. I can't do business with people like that. Business should be boring. I'll talk to him later, in private. So please, the gun. So why are you wearing that jacket? What's your deal? - What? - That jacket, you know that we're in the middle of a peak heat wave. Are you cold all of a sudden or something? - This isn't really how I pictured this going. - Look, it's one thing that you bring a gun into my place of business, it's another thing that you wear a November jacket in June. That's just going to make you stand out like a sore thumb. It's just a bit obvious. It's just stupid. What are you doing here? - Friend of mine told me I should check this place out. - You're not from here. I'd know it if you were. My guess is that you're not traveling far. What do you do? - Nothing in particular. - And what are you working on now? - Odd jobs. Here and there. - You know what? I did 10 years in Joliet for odd jobs. Okay, so you can stop talking to me in code. I'm not going to take you in. I know what you are in a general sense, so don't give me no bullshit. - I know my way around. Travel, guns, supply. I run protection. I pick up, I do drops. If there's interest here, I'll stick around. If not, it's cool. I'll go-- - Who told you to come here? - Can't say. - All right, then I think we should have another meeting. In the meantime, why don't you leave your info with Jolene? - Why her? - Because I fucking said so. Now, you want to stay around, you learn how to take fucking direction. No no, no no no. You go. It stays. See you later, Cowboy. [door closing] (soft mysterious music) - I'm flattered. - It's for Hughes. - What's the message? - That is the message. - Hey, need a favor. I need a recorder. Look, you don't have to tell anyone. I just need something small. It'll fit inside something I carry. I don't know. Impress me. Lighter, try a lighter on my desk, something. When? Thanks. (soft mysterious music) - Right, right. - Hey, ladies. - Hey, how you doing, man? - [Chris] I managed to get some clothes on today, so lucky you. - [Jim] Well you look like shit, but you're on your feet. So things are looking up. - We'll see about that. - Sit down. Grab a glass. If you need anything, you know who to turn to. Did you call that counselor? - I will. - Do it. - [Anthony] All right, I was just telling Jim about the Kewanee connect that Goldy was talking about on the recorder. - [Chris] Yeah, what do we have on the Kewanee, huh? - Nothing, the deal was dissolved. No cases were made. - What about Goldy? He's talking to someone who can move that product. When you set this up, who plugged you into him? - Listen, I'm working this piecemeal for a reason. This Goldy turned out to be one hell of a lot more than they told me he was. So the less guys you know about this right now the better. When you're back, then we'll regroup. - Just tell us who it was. - I said not now. Watch him. Your interview's tomorrow. 9:00 AM in the office. [door bell tinkling] - [Manny] Be there tomorrow at the diner. 8:00 AM. - [Chris] Got it. I'm going to bounce, you got that lighter? - So the USB is your recorder. Run a couple tests to make sure it's working for you, all right? My man, all right. Be easy. Hey, I never gave that to you. (soft mysterious music) [lighter clicking] (soft mysterious music) [lighter clicking] [Knife punctures tire] [air hissing] - Where's my gun? - Coffee? Look, if I give you your gun, you're going to go away. And I want you to stay. I want to hear your story. Everybody's got a story. How do you like your coffee? - [Chris] Don't matter to me. - So, I know you didn't come here about your gun. What do you need? - [Chris] You called me. - You didn't come here because I called you. What do you want? - I want to know what a man like you is doing in Kewanee. - I can always tell how smart somebody is by how dumb they think I am. - What do you want from me? - I want to know what everybody wants to know about you. Whether you got any balls or not. - Is this why you called me? To scare me? Feel free to give me your pitch whenever you want. If this is it, I'll go. Call me when you do have something. - I'm looking for someone. He's dangerous. Rips crews, sells what he gets. - He rip you? - Doesn't matter. - Then why do you want to find him? - Why I want to find him has nothing to do with the job I'm offering you. - 10,000. Five upfront, the rest when I get him. - 10,000? I'm not asking you to smoke him. All right, if you find him and bring him in, I'll cover it. Payment on delivery. - And what about my gun? - Find another one. - I like mine. - When you bring him in. Don't you want to know his name? - [Chris] Sure. - He goes by Goldy. We good? - Yeah. - [Hughes] Good. - If I find what he stole from you, what's that worth to you? - Probably another 10. - Still not going to tell me what he took? - I'll let Goldy tell you, when you find him. All right. Let him out. - You had enough? I'll just top you off while you think about it. - Is that your car out back? It's got a flat. - Fuck. (sighing) - Need a lift somewhere? - I'll figure something out. - No problem, I can be back here later. - You don't have to do that. - I'm offering. We can talk. I've got a couple questions. - Like what? - Hughes didn't mind you stepping in and out of our conversation back there. Looks like he trusts you. I want to know what I need to know about him. - It's a little late now that you took his offer. - Even more reason to talk to you about him. - Be back at three. - All right. - [Jim] Hey, how you doing? - I'm fine. Let's just do it. - Look, you just tell them how it went down and you'll be cleared by the end of the week. - How it went down, huh? How did it go down? - What do you mean? - Silvis, the CS. There were 30 keys inside that house, and they pointed us right to it. They didn't need us. Why were we putting Mikey into that? - Listen to me. You just stick to what you know, and I'll get you cleared. - Where's Goldy hiding out? - How the fuck should I know? - You're the one who's been scouring the fucking Earth for him. If I come back, it's so that we can figure this out. - When you're reinstated, I can get into this with you. And I'll see you in there. - Maybe we should check down by the Westchester Vacants. I hear there's a lot of people hanging around down there. I know how much you love a field trip. - [Chris] Who else have you talked to? What parts do you need from me? - I'm just interested in your take today. Let's start with when you arrived on the scene. - Silvis PD reached out to Jim about a house they had their eye on. They thought it was holding. I never heard what got them interested. Jim said they wanted-- - Just pick it up when you arrived. We can stick to the shoot only. - I posted up within sight of the house. Backup unit was another block out. I was there when Mikey pulled up, went inside, and then his wire went down. At least the signal did. One of our suspects, Goldy, exited the house, drove off in Mikey's UC car. I saw that and I made the call. We had to take the house. Backup rolled up, Anthony and Davis. Davis hit the door, I was first in. Anthony right behind me. How am I doing so far? Suspect spooked. He was on a chair right in front of me. And he had a gun right away. Mikey was on the couch. When we got in there, he called out to me by name. I tried shouting some instruction over him. Hoping the shooter missed it. Drop the gun. Don't move, and all that shit. But the suspect was keyed in on Mikey. Heard him address me, and he wasn't hearing anything else. Thought he was getting robbed. Mikey was trying to place peacemaker. He stands up. Suspect thought he was making a move. Fired on him. On Mikey. And hit him, one shot to the head. I opened up on him. I opened up on the suspect. Anthony and Davis did the same. We put him down. He died right there. After we killed the first suspect, Anthony and Davis started to search the back of the house. They ran into a shooter with an AR, got pinned down in a hallway. Pulled Mikey out the front and went back in. Anthony and I, we got the shooter. He died on the scene too. - [Trudell] Okay, I appreciate you taking the time. I think that's all we need. - What? - I know that wasn't easy. I'll get this typed up, and then I'll get this wrapped up for you guys. - What the fuck kind of an investigation is this? You haven't asked me anything of substance. - [Trudell] That's all we need. - I was the one who told Jim that Mikey was ready. He wasn't ready, and I knew it. He never should have been in that spot. Never should have gone in that house. As the lead investigator, you're obligated to make a note of that, take that into consideration. This is a reinstatement hearing, isn't it? - Mikey let Goldy take his car. He knew enough not to let that happen without you knowing about it first. Mikey fucked up. - I told you the wire was down, you cocksucker! - [Trudell] Mikey fucked up! You took the house, you had to! The suspect freaked out. It is not your fault. I will submit my report with the facts that I've verified! Thank you for coming in today, Chris! - You're a circus boy on a string, aren't you? Fuck you! - Hey, that's enough. All right, Chris, goddammit, we all get you're upset, but there's no reason to bring that kind of fucking bullshit in here. - What do I need to know? - About what? - You talk to Hughes. I'm guessing you've known him for a while. What do I need to know about Hughes? - Make him happy. Just up ahead. - Need a lift tomorrow? - I got it worked out. Car's in the shop. - Let me know. I'm around. - You're dealing with some really smart, really fucking scary people. I hope you know what you're doing. (soft mysterious music) - [Chris] About today, I uh ... - It's okay. I get it. I probably should have told you a lot of this shit. - How do you know Manny Ortega, from Kewanee? - What do you think's going on? - There's an ugly cast of characters come flooding into my world since this shoot. I want to know how you know them. - I'm running Manny. He's under with Hughes. - What about the house? Goldy ripped that product from Hughes, and then we shoot up Goldy's stash house. Why? - The op was to show Hughes Manny's got the department on the take and he can use us on assignment. Manny helps Hughes find the load, earns his trust, and then we've got him. - Why Mikey? - As soon as we pop Hughes, you're going to take my place. So if shit was going to go down in that house, I couldn't take the risk of having you caught in there. And I liked Mikey's confidence. You said yourself you thought he was ready. Look, Trudell's writing it up now. You're cleared. You start tomorrow. We got the Maylum warrant from Mikey's first trash grab. That roach was enough. I was wrong about that. So if you want to set things right for Mikey, finish his first case. I want you ready to serve that warrant at 7:00 AM outside her place. It's very dangerous for you to think you know everything that's going on here. So stand down. Sit this one out. And I'll bring you in on Hughes when I need you. But until then, whatever you do, don't fuck this up and get anybody killed. - What happened to you? - 7:00 AM tomorrow morning. [gun Clicking] (soft suspenseful music) [lighter striking] (soft suspenseful music) - [SWAT] ERU's in position. We're a couple blocks down. Ready for your go. - [Chris] Copy that. Stand by, I'll give you the signal. - [SWAT] Copy that. Standing by. (soft suspenseful music) [gun clicking] 91 to 87, this is ERU, come in. - This is Chris. (birds singing) - [SWAT] ERU's in position. What's the holdup? - Copy that. Stand by. Keep the channel clear. - [SWAT] Copy that. (soft suspenseful music) [machine gun firing] [glass smashing] (soft suspenseful music) [gun firing] (tires squealing) [gun firing] [glass smashing] [engine idling] (soft suspenseful music) - Police, show me your hands. [engine idling] [birds singing] [car door closing] (soft suspenseful music) (no scream heard) - [Chris On Recording] If I find what he stole from you, what's that worth to you? - [Hughes] Probably another 10. - [Chris] Still not going to tell me what he took? - [Hughes] I'll let Goldy tell you, when you find him. [door creaking] - Hey. Go for a ride? - Sure, get in. - Right hand. Take your right hand, adjust the mirror and look at me. Keep your hands on the wheel. Just drive. I'm going to tell you what I know, and then you're going to tell me everything that you know. Last week, I'm running surveillance on a stash house in Silvis. Goldy leaves that house, and after a misunderstanding, a rookie cop was murdered. Goldy disappears, I go on leave, and I spot my boss take a secret meeting with Manny. When I confront him about it, he tells me that the Silvis House, Manny, Kewanee, Hughes, it's all part of an undercover op, with Manny infiltrating Hughes. It's all very hush-hush, better not ask any questions. Bullshit. The day after he tells me this, today, I'm sitting in my car back on the job, waiting to serve a warrant and I take fire from a drive-by. Shooter was a guy I saw at Clayton's Club night you and I met. You told me Hughes doesn't have it out for me, and I believe you. This has something to do with Hughes getting robbed. Then it means that my boss got spooked by my seeing what he's been up to. Manny undercover op is bullshit, and he puts out a hit on me. All I wanted to know was why. Now they're coming after me. Day and night, you work for Hughes. If you're involved, I'm going to roll you up like the rest of them. You hear me? You're pinned down, forced to help Hughes, I can help you. But only if you help me. I want everything you know. People, places, events, stash houses, if you got them. Without that, you're just one of them. - I know what I'm doing, and I don't need to tell you shit. I'm no fucking victim. Do you hear that? I'm not a fucking victim! I don't need you to come in here and think you can fucking save me! Who the fuck do you think you are, huh? You want to know the truth? The truth is, you work for Hughes too. You're just too fucking stupid to know it. - Where's the stash? Where do the shipments come in? Where do they live before they go out? - Are you fucking listening to me? - You deliver the stash, tell me the routes, the pipelines, I'll get you out. Listen, I'll set you up. New life, new home, I promise you that. - You have no friends. Nobody! Who's going to help you, me? Huh? Tell me! Nobody's going to believe you. - You let me worry about that. Keep doing what you do, and I'll find you when it's time. Pull over, right there. [gun Clicking] It's going to be okay. [car door Closing] [gun Clicking] (soft mysterious music) [footsteps descending] - [Chris] Lot of people looking for you. - Now who the fuck is you? - Watched you drive off in my partner's car in Silvis. He died after you left that house. - So you come to the Vacants looking for sympathy from Goldy? I don't give a fuck about your partner. I lost people in that house too. - Okay, I'll make this quick. I'm a cop, and I work for dirty cops who want me dead. They work for Hughes, who wants you dead. - So let me get this right. Your last partner gets killed. Now it sound like you want me to be your partner. I got to be honest. That's not a real good selling point. So what, you tired of running? - I don't need to run. - Running is living. - That's surviving. That's not living. - Well if I was you, Mr. Officer, I'd get to thinking both of them as the same thing, feel me? You got a plan and some shit? - I want to build a case. Get something off to the feds. Maybe a care package to the press. After a few years, everybody does time. - Okay. - Got a better idea? - Yeah, I'm going to burn this shit down and start a fucking war. Now that's a fucking plan. - I won't do that. - Oh yeah? And why the fuck not? - I'm not going to let this thing burn and leave people I owe holding the bag. If you're in, I'm in it with you. We're connected, no cowboy shit. There's another way. I don't know if you're going to like it. I know we didn't seize all the dope you stole. Hughes says he's looking for 40 keys, and we only seized 30 in that house. So you call Hughes and offer to sell him his own shit back to him. You set the meets for the exchange. I bug it. And that's it, case closed. - I ain't going to lie. If you want me to be your partner, you off to a good fucking start (laughs). Why don't you tell me what's in it for you? - I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want them doing it anymore either. - You ain't even smart enough to know how many ways this can go bad, are you? - Sitting on that load's going to get you nothing but killed. You know what I mean? You set the meet and make the deal, you can go. Fine by me. - All right, what the fuck you waiting on? Let's do it. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] - Agent Singleton. - [Chris] Is this Singleton from the Illinois Joint Task Force? - Who's this? - I'm narcotics with a local PD. Sitting on some sensitive stuff. Looks like it might be pointing towards a conspiracy case. - [Singleton] Okay, can you tell me what it is? - [Chris] I've got recordings. Both sides, drug traffickers and PD. - [Singleton] You got any names? - [Chris] I'm putting it together now. People are looking for me. I'm trying to lay low. I don't know how long that's going to last. - Honestly, I'm not really hearing much that I can go on here. - Listen, it all starts with this Silvis house shooting, took place about a week ago. Take a closer look at what happened. You'll either trust me or you won't. - [Singleton] Can we meet? - [Chris] We'll need to meet soon, but it's going to happen fast. I'll have everything in hand. If I call, I'm going to need you to be there quick, or I'm probably a dead man. I need a yes or a no right now. - What do I call you? - [Chris] Just call me Mikey. (soft suspenseful music) - [Chris] I need a yes or a no. - If I want out, I can get out myself. - And be looking over your shoulder? If you do it my way, you won't have to. We can do this together. (Jolene exhaling) (soft suspenseful music) - Okay. - [Chris] I'm going to need you to take me to the stash tonight. [crickets chirping] (soft suspenseful music) - Do you have to go? Let's just go. Get out of here. Go to the beach. I don't want to be the reason you get hurt. - [Chris] We can make it better for everyone else who's here. We can do what I always set out to do. Do this job right. Go home. Get ready. [phone Ringing] - Yo, where Hughes at? - [Manny] May I ask who's calling? - Tell him it's his father, I'm back. It's Goldy, motherfucker. - What can I do you for? - Let me tell you a little story. Put your hearing aid in. Once upon a time ago, there was this old fella, missing 60 keys. He wanted to get it back so bad that he'd do anything for it, even pay for it. Now what would make him want to buy back his own product? Because if he doesn't, I'm assuming that the people that he answer to going to start asking questions real soon. Plot twist. Then came along somebody that found those keys. And this guy was so nice, such a nice guy (chuckles). And he offered to sell him 30 keys back for 15K, each of course. - I don't think it's fair to call it missing since we all know who had it the whole time. Hm? Look, how do you like it down there at them Vacants? You like the smell of shit and decay everywhere? Does it get cold at night? Must smell a little better once there's a breeze flowing in. I don't know if I like your offer. I need to think about it. - You's a funny nigger, old head. But you know what? You right. It do get a little chilly. Lucky me, though, I found this house right up the road from here. There's a whole lot of product in there, ain't it? Setting fire to that, now that might keep me warm a little while, what you think? - Give me the details. - No time like the present, so we going to do this shit today. You and Jim Grace, you all come together. I'm going to bring you your work, 30 keys, and you bring me my money, 450,000. You get your product, and I get my money. Then we go our separate ways. The end. - I'll meet you later, and whoever else you're bringing. (soft suspenseful music) - [Jolene] Ah. - [Chris] I see you. Can you hear me? - Copy. - [Chris] Go ahead and turn around so you're pointed to the exit, ass end toward that barrel right there. That's good. Hold there. - [Goldy] Where you hiding at? - None of your business. I don't need you tipping them off by looking my way. I'm close. - Tipping them off? How do I know you ain't tipping them off? You the police, motherfucker. I was thinking anyway, Chris, you want to explain to me why you ain't trying to roll me up to? - Nobody cares about you. - Yeah, all right. - [Chris] Word of advice, though. Get a little distance between you and this place when we're done here. That is, unless you want to testify. I won't stop you then. - Testify. What jury's going to believe Goldy testimony? (laughing) (soft suspenseful music) - Okay, G, here's our villains. (soft suspenseful music) [door slamming] (soft suspenseful music) - [Goldy] Pistol out till I see the money. No hard feelings. - No, there's no offense. You don't mind if my man Jim here shows his too, right? - [Goldy] I don't give a fuck. - You know what, it must be awful hard to move that kind of product around here, right? - [Goldy] Sound like a personal problem to me. Your problem. - [Jim] What the fuck you looking at? - [Goldy] You, pussy. - What the fuck did you s-- - No no, no no, no no no. Let's just put a timer on it, okay? I mean, there's no need to draw this out. Why don't you show me what you got? - [Goldy] Despite what you may think of me, I am a man of my word. I got what I say I got. Minus a few grams. Come see for yourself. - That's a whole lot of dope, man. That's an awful lot for somebody to be out here with nobody backing him up. - [Goldy] Come on, old man. I thought age comes with wisdom. You seem to be getting dumber. Don't be stupid. [Goldy] Pick it up. Walk it over to my car. [bag zipping] [Hughes] All right. - [Goldy] Nice doing business with you boys. - Well, well, well. - [Goldy] Let's do this again sometime. - Maybe (laughs). Oh, I almost forgot. I got something for you to give Chris. Yeah, you see, I uh, I asked him to find you. I didn't really have faith that he could actually do it, but look at this, abra cadabra. He found my product. I hate to give him his bonus, but what can I say? I'm a man of my word. And he delivered. He brought me you, and my shit. - Stop walking. Don't fucking move. - It's okay, Jim, I got this. - [Goldy] Show me what you got. - Hey, it's just an envelope. 20K. - [Goldy] Chris, get the fuck out here right now. - He's fucking lying. He wants you to draw me out. - It's real simple. You either get out here and explain, or it's every man for himself, do you understand? - I don't want his money. Tell him to get in his car and get the fuck out of here. - [Goldy] Chris, what the fuck? Remember when I told you about how this shit could go bad? - [Chris] I'm not coming out. - All right, here I am being a nice guy and shit. I could take the money and the work, shoot both these motherfuckers, don't mean shit to me. - Wait, wait wait. No. (suspenseful music) I'm coming out. (suspenseful music) - [Goldy] Any time, Chris. - Hughes asked me to do a job. Find you, and the product for a bonus. I said yes just to stay close to him. When I found out Jim was helping Hughes, I went after both of them. They tried to have me killed for it. That's when I went to find you. - I hear you, Chris. Funny how the tables turn, right? Checkmate. - You got what you wanted. Let's get the fuck out of here. - How I know you ain't still working with them, huh? How I know they ain't get you to draw me out, and then you rip me and take me in. Fuck that. I look like a dumb nigger to you? Prove it, Chris. Shoot Jim, and I got Hughes. And ain't no trials, no jury and all that extra bullshit you talking about. Game over with, White Boy. - Can't do that. - Sorry, Chris. Maybe I forgot to mention. I don't follow orders. I give them. Shoot that motherfucker. - Don't do it, Chris. - Shut the fuck up, Pig. - Nobody has to die today. Why are you doing this? - He used you. Old head fucking used you. Maybe you ain't hear me the first time. Let me say it again. It's the last time, though, Chris. I will shoot this shit the fuck up. And I will kill you next. I don't like your way of doing shit anyway. I like mines better. - Just take the money. - I already got your fucking money. - Well then just take this too. - [Goldy] Open it. - Wait, what? - [Goldy] Shut the fuck up. - [Chris] Don't listen to him. - Hey, man, I said shut the fuck up! - It's just two bands. 10 each. - Might as well take everything, right? - [Chris] Be smart, man. - Hey, man, I said shut the fuck up-- [gun firing] (soft dramatic music) [guns firing] [guns firing rapidly] - Whoa, okay, whoa whoa whoa! Whoa! It's over! That's it, folks. All right, stop. It's over. It's over, guys. It's done, finis. Huh? I had to sort him out. Fucking kid. I had no choice. He was going to take us all out. All right, guys, listen. There's no need for anybody else to get hurt, right. Just relax. Let's lower our guns. All right, whoo! Whoo! That's what you get when you mix up a cray-cray in grown man's business! Jim? You all right? - Yeah, I'm great. - Hey, Chris? It's okay. How you doing? Huh? Oh, that's good. All right, Jim, you lower that gun, Son. Okay? Now why don't we all just leave before we cause a real racket? All right? Now we still got shit to sort out. I promise you, we'll live to kill each other another day. All right. Thank you. You take care of that. All right, Jim, let's go. You can drive, right? - [Jim] Yeah. - All right. See you later, Chris. [engine starting] - Fuck! Fuck! (soft mysterious music) - Agent Singleton. - It's Mikey. We need to make this handoff now. - What is it? - It's everything, but it has to be right now. I'm headed to the old bag factory out on 61. Meet me there. What are you driving? What are you driving? - A black Crown Vic. - 20 minutes. (soft mysterious music) - All right, why don't you take a load off? - [Jim] Well, we're fucked. We got to get out of here as soon as I get patched up. - [Hughes] Yeah, I wouldn't worry about getting out just yet. - What? - Look, Chris still needs to find somebody to make his case, all right. No handoff, no case. - He's handing it off right fucking now! Are you kidding me? The FBI, the state cops, the DEA, who the fuck knows? - Yeah, well, the handoff isn't just our problem. There's other people that are deeply involved in this, okay. They're going to make sure that Chris never makes it to the drop. Now you need to just relax. All right? I got a vet coming here really soon. - A vet? You think I'm a fucking basset hound? - Look, he knows his way around a suture or two. You want a drink? - God yes. - All this excitement is making us thirsty. - No shit. - You want one cherry or two? - What are you making? - A proper old-fashioned. - Two cherries. Hey, make it a double, will you. - Don't push it. (Jim chuckling) [lighter clicking] (soft music) - What are you doing here? - We got to go right now. - What are you talking about? I can't go. I'm waiting for someone. - No, we have to go. - It's fine, I'm waiting. - We have to get out of here, just listen to me! - Get down. Get behind the car. [engine racing] [gun firing] [tires sliding] (soft suspenseful music) [vehicle approaching] - Hey, yo, close it up. [Recording of Chris's shooting] - What was that? - Oh, you scared the shit out of me, man. Just listening to some old recordings. - Heavy shit, huh? - Yeah, you could say that. - I been thinking. Maybe it'd be a good idea for you to take a little time off. - What? - Well, we're going to be stopped down anyway, while I interview new candidates. You know, get things restructured a little bit. - We not shutting down? - Shutting down? - Yeah. - (laughs) You're taking Chris' place. We got two new agents coming in, and they got to be trained. Nothing stops the streets. Nothing stops us. Take some time, rest up, get back here fresh. There's a war on crime, my man. (soft suspenseful music) [vehicle approaching] (soft suspenseful music) Man.
