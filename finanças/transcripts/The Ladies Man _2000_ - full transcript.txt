Along the Kennedy Expressway, a truck overturned in the slow lane. Along the Stevenson Expressway, the traffic moving along nicely. Another Shadow traffic update with TJ. Burks in ten minutes. You are listening to WRIX, Chicago's number one news and financial net work. Now, back to Money Matters. Welcome back, I'm your host, Gil Stewart, and we're almost out of time here on Money Matters, but here's a quick wrap-up of the day's biggest stories. The Dow closing out today at minus 55, while the NASDAQ was up seven points. The S&P is down four. Gold takes a big hit on the floor as the International Monetary Fund... unloads 10% of its gold holdings, causing ripples throughout the banking industry, continuing the trend in unloading the bulk of its holdings... in favor of better-performing securities. You've been listening to Money Matters. I'm Gil Stewart, looking after your money. It's now 2:00 a.m. and time for... What's happening? And welcome to The Ladies Man, the love line with all the right responses to your romantic queries. My name is Leon Phelps, and to those of you that are uninitiated, I am an expert in the ways of love. Um, I have made love to many fine ladies, from the lowliest bus station skank... to the classiest, most sophisticated, educated, debutante, high society bus station skank. But listen. I am doing good, if you were askin'. I got my Courvoisier cognac right here, and I'm ready to take your calls. While I am not a psychiatrist or a psychologist or whatever, I have done it to a lot of ladies, and that makes me somewhat like an expert. I have a Ph.D. in tang, as it were. So, if you have a romantic query and you are under the age of 50... and you're not freaky or disgustin', please give us a call. My lovely producer, Julie Simmons, she is over there and she is awaiting with bated breath... to hear what you got to say. Okay, you're gonna have to hold anyway, sir. Yeah. Susan from Oak Park. you have a question for Leon? Oh, he left his clothes at your house. The phone is lighting up, so let's take a call. Hey, what's happening? This is Leon Phelps. You got The Ladies Man. - Hello, Ladies Man. - Oh, it's a lady. I'm new to this city. and I don't know too many people. And I am painfully shy. Yeah, you sound painfully shy. Listen, this is what you should do. Go to the bus station or to a bowling alley... and hang out with no underpants. - Trust me. It works. - What? You'd be surprised at how many men will approach you. I know that I would. Next caller, go ahead. You got The Ladies Man. Ladies Man. I've been feeling really confused. Yeah, that sounds good. No, it's not good. I'm in a relationship, but I don't know if he is for real. How do you know when you're really, truly in love? Don't worry. When you're really, truly in love, you will feel it deep down in your pants. Unless, of course, you're not wearing any pants, which is not uncommon in my case. What are you talking about? I asked you about finding true love. Yeah, that's right. You did. Listen, I hope whatever I said was helpful. Next caller. You got The Ladies Man. Next caller. You got The Ladies Man. Ma'am, I'm gonna have to put you on hold, okay? Ladies Man. Listen, I don't care what you say. Chlamydia is a soup. It's my opinion. I can have that if I'd like. You don't have to argue. I've seen it on the grocery store shelves. Yes, I know that clam chowder is not a venereal disease. Don't argue with me about it. I don't care if you are a doctor. No, we promise there won't be any more vulgar material. You gotta get a thumb and just stick it up in there. Actually, get two thumbs up in there, you know, like the Fonz. Like this, "Hey." There may be weird smells afterwards, but don't worry. just take a shower. Hey, go ahead, caller. You got The Ladies Man. No one knows where Leon came from exactly, but he started out life on the steps of a majestic mansion. The master of the house was a great man... who surrounded himself with the world's most beautiful objects. He had everything he wanted, except a son. Young Leon was taken into this world... and raised as one of their own. And in that warm family environment,. Leon developed into quite a stylish young man. He learned everything a bright kid would wanna know about... stereo systems and, of course, love. In this magical kingdom, the king shared everything with him. Only one thing was off-limits. But Leon being Leon, the day arrived when the benevolent proprietor and Leon parted ways. Poor little Leon was thrown out into the cold, much like Moses in the days of old. After that it Wash't easy for the little man, but he got along. He always did. Not because he was smart and not because he was rich, but because... the ladies loved Leon Phelps. - How did he do it? - Hey, Leon. Well, I guess you'd better ask the man yourself. Lester, how come you tell that story every time we walk into this bar? I don't know. Maybe there's somebody out there who don't know you. Yeah, right. It's the same five or six people in this place. - How'd your show go tonight? - Oh, yeah, good question. Um, same old, same old. Leon Phelps is a genius. Yeah, same old angry calls from our listeners... and same old threats from the boss. But listen, for every hundred angry calls we get, there is somebody that I helped. Ain't that right, Scrap Iron? Huh? Yeah. Leon single-handedly saved my second and fourth marriages. - Mm-hmm. - That's right. And it was Leon... who taught me I didn't have to be ashamed of my body. Thank you, Candy. You see, I like to help people. That is what I do. You know, lam like Mother Teresa, but of bonin', you see what I'm saying? Listen, Julie, you are now in the world of Leon Phelps, okay? Everything will work out. Trust me. Thank you, Scrap. And besides that, Julie, you have to learn... that there are more important things in life than work. - Can I help you? - Martini with lemon. So excuse me while Leon Phelps shows you... how he brings home the bacon. That's my cue. I'm out of here. Yeah, I know. It's a heartbreak, ain't it, girlfriend? I mean, when's it gonna be our turn, right? You know, you and me are exactly alike. Eerie. - See you later, Scrap Iron. - Bye, baby. - Bye, Lester. See you tomorrow, Leon. - Bye, sweetie. There goes Julie Simmons. I bet you're wondering what a nice girl like that is doing in a place like this. That's exactly what I was wondering one night about two years ago. ♪ Do me wrong ♪ ♪ Do me right ♪ ♪ Do me right, baby ♪ ♪ Tell me lies ♪ Bourbon, up. Let me help you with that. There you go. Listen, I was wondering, can I ask you a question? Was your father a meat burglar? Here's why I ask. Because it looks like somebody... stole two fine hams and shoved them down the back of your dress. And then it happened. She started laughing. Kept on laughing. I thought she was crazy. They talked and laughed on into the night. Leon didn't go home with her, but he took home her business card. She said she was in radio. Said she wanted to put Leon on the radio. That was two years ago. I guess she packed her wedding dress away... for another day. Listen, seriously, Lester. Can you take a break for a second? I'm trying to concentrate over here. Leon, think she gonna be a tough shoe to polish. Au contraire, bon jour. Let me give you the play-by-play. I will probably begin with a very classy first line. Something like... Say, sweet thing, can I buy you a fish sandwich? Mm-hmm. And then I will commence to whisper sweet words in her ear. Something like... Man, I'd like to take a bite out of your butt. And then I will close the deal by giving her a preview of... the goods. ♪ Hallelujah ♪ The day you pick up that pretty woman, that's the day I believe a wet bird don't fly at night. Yeah? Well, get ready to see a wet bird fly at night, my friend. Say there, sweet thing. Uh, I have a question. Could I... - Hey, swinger. I've got an idea. - Yeah? My husbands away. Let's go back to my place. So you don't want a fish sandwich? Okay, that's cool, I guess. But listen. - My car doesn't exist, so... - Shut up. Yes. The bus is what we'll be taking. Hey! Hey, man! Hey! - To the left'. Yeah. just like that. - Like that? Honey, the front door. Barney, is that you? Well, it isn't the Orkin man. I'll be right there. You'll never guess what happened. I was cleaning up the broom closet, and it was so stuffed with crap. So I opened the door... and it was like, "Uh-uh-uh-uh." Don't open that door, McGee. 'Cause all that stuff... just came tumbling down all over me. Cheryl! - Do you have a man in there with you? - Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Don't stop. Cheryl! Oh, don't stop! Oh, don't... Listen, baby, that was cool, but I gotta go. No! Wake up! It is 2:30 in the a.m., and you are listenin' to The Ladies Man. All right. So let's take some more calls. Go ahead, caller. Hello? Am I on? Yes, you are. What seems to be your query? U... Well, look, I've never called a show like this before, but, I'm in... I'm in really bad shape. I was, uh... I was kind of hoping that you'd help me out. Well, we'll see what we can do. So, I came home last night, and what do you know. My wife of seven years was in the sack with another guy. - Yeah, that sounds good. - No, it's not good. I... I saw the guy. I saw him running... running down the street. He had this, like, smiley... tattoo thing on his, uh, on his, uh... Okay, sir, listen. We're gonna take a break right now. We'll be back in a few moments with the answer to our survey, "What is your favorite hole?" Thanks for calling. I don't wanna talk. I just came to pick up my- Barney! No! No! It's not what you think. Way to go, Leon. You really are a class act. Well, what can I say, baby? The ladies, they love Leon Phelps. What ladies? Who are these women? And why do you feel like you have to sleep with all of them? Um, let me see. Have you ever had sex? Yes, Leon, I've had sex. Yes, well, there you go. That's delightful. - Yeah. - You know, it's exactly that kind of language that's gonna get you kicked off the air... - Mr. Kent. - Yes! You certainly seem in good spirits today. I didn't think it showed. I just got a letter from the F.C.C. So I suppose you could say I'm full of contentment and cheer. What do you mean? I'm sure you're aware your smutty-mouth little friend, Leon Phelps, has always been a thorn in my side. He's unprofessional. He drinks on the air. He has a little sip of cognac now and then, but... I would have fired him years ago if he wasn't such a... such a favorite with the owner of the station. I don't know what she sees in him. But I finally decided to go over her head about this... and straight to the F.C.C. And if Leon Phelps is responsible for even one more... tiny little fine, I get to fire him. Well, we haven't had a fine in weeks. Leon's completely cleaned up his act. - Oh, is that a fact? - Caller, you got The Ladies Man. Yeah, you see, what your problem is... is that you suffer from, um, "homo-un-erectus." Which means, basically, that your Wang is "hugeified" not by a woman but by a man. Well, you never know. I mean, some nights the F.C.C. doesn't even listen. - Really? - No! They listen all the time. Probably listening now. What's up? Bucky Kent is visiting us in the station. How you doing? Well, I guess he can? stick around. But you still got Leon Phelps. I'm sticking it out here. We gonna take a break. We gonna be right back. - Leon... - Don't let Bucky get you all upset. - He is just jealous. - Leon, I think he's serious this time. He said that the radio station won't pay for any more of your fines. I tell you what I'm gonna do. We only got three minutes left for the show. I'm just gonna ease my way out. Play a little music. No more phone calls. And you'll see by tomorrow Bucky Kent will be all cooled down. - You promise? - Julie, come on. The one person you can trust is Leon Phelps. - Okay. - Kiss me. Kiss me! Stop it. What's happening? You got The Ladies Man, Leon Phelps here, and I am looking at a half-empty bottle of Courvoisier, which means that we are just about out of time. But before I go, I'd like to leave you with just one more thought. This is a little something that I wrote. And I read: “ What is love? What is this longing in our hearts for togetherness? Is it not the sweetest flower? Does not this flower of love... have the fragrant aroma affine, fine diamonds? Does not the wind love the dirt? Is not love not unlike the unlikely not it is unliking to? Are you with someone tonight? Do not question your love. Take your lover by the hand. Release the power within yourself You heard me, release the power. Tame the wild cosmos with a whisper. Conquer heaven with one intimate caress. That's right. Don't be shy. Whip out everything you've got... and do it in the butt." By Leon Phelps. Let's go. Come on. - Good distance. - Yeah, not bad. Listen, Julie, I just wanna say... thank you for sticking up for me. - Yeah, okay. Leon... - Listen. You always stick up for me. - Yeah, but Leon... - You're the greatest, you know? - Thank you. - And another thing. No matter what they do to me, they can fire me from their radio station, they can call me all kinds of names, they can make me get down on my knees and beg for my job, but the one thing that they cannot take away... from sweet Leon... is his dignity. So this is my fabulous yacht. Or as I like to call it, my personal "skankuary." I told you before, Leon, it's not a yacht if you get mail there. It's more like a trailer park of the sea. Yeah, well, even so, this is what I like to call the L.A. Forum, because this is where the magic happens. And the magic just happened once on that chair that you're touching. I have performed the magic once in that wastepaper basket. You know, I actually had to get the magic cleaned from out of this curtain. That was along shot. Wore me out. Let's get you into bed, okay? - Here. - Officer, no. Come on. Let's see if we can get you into bed. Watch it. Ow! - I'm sorry, Julie. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Come on. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Listen, I handle my drink better than today. - I've seen you. I know. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the firing. - It's okay just lie down. - You deserve better. - It's okay. We're gonna be fine. - You should be with a professional. Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me? No, I'm not. In fact, I'm looking around this place... and I can't understand why anyone would ever want to seduce you. ♪ Turn off the lights ♪ That is why. - ♪ Light a candle ♪ - You've gotta be kidding. Mm-mmm. - "Pina Colada Butt Lotion"? - Mm-hmm. Where do you even find this stuff? Mostly at K-Mart and Wal-Mart. And why do you have a water bed when you live on a boat? Oh, it's because there's more motion in the ocean. Come on in, baby. The water's fine. - So Julie? - Huh? Are we going to do it? No, we are not going to do it. I would hate to see you as an old man, Leon. You are gonna be one sorry sight. - Where you going? - I'm going home. The job search starts tomorrow. Oh, boy. Smiley... ass tattoo. "Victims of the smiling ass." "Have you seen this ass?" Yeah. Yeah, yeah. "Welcome to the V.S.A. Victims of the smiling ass. We will have our revenge." Well, let me tell you a little bit about WRQE. We play all the biggest names in soft rock and light jazz. Folks like Enya, Yanni, Tesh. I don't know if you've heard of a lady who goes by the name of Celine Dion. No, who is that? I have to say I've heard of you, but I'm not too familiar with your show. I don't stay up that late anymore. - Do you have a tape I could listen to? - I'm afraid we don't have a tape... Yeah, actually, we do. This should give you a good idea of what we can bring to your station. Fantastic. Let's see what we've got here. You know, clinically speaking, doing it doggy style has... There's some racy stuff at the beginning, but you can speed through it. All right. Yeah. Sounds like the answer for you is doing it doggy style. Just speed through. Same stuff. Boy, excuse me. Anyways, doggy style... You can speed right through that part too. Yeah, see, you was kicked in the scrotum. Or as they say in the medical profession, the ball sac. You can skip through that part. Well, you know, the scientific name is the "Hershey Highway." Speed on through. Hey. But that is the only tape. The tape is important. There's people looking. That's not... Don't... - Miss, uh, Simmons? - Yes. Uh, let's see. Oh, very nice. Very nice. - Thank you. - And, uh... Mr. Phelps. Yeah, that's me. I'm presently in the process of getting my resume typed up over at Kinko's. - Kinko's. Good people. Nice. - Yeah. I see under "interests," you've written "Debit"? Ah, No, that's "Dabutt." - "Dabutt?" - Yeah. And also, I like tennis. Good, good. Well, Mr. Phelps, today might be your lucky day. Our morning anchor quit, out of the blue. And we are desperate for someone to fill her old slot. Well, that's no problem, 'cause I have a lot of experience at filling other people's slots. - Really? - Mm-hmm. You mean you've filled other people's slots before? - Yeah, this morning. - Fantastic. You got the job. Really? Yeah, absolutely. Well, welcome to WPJT Radio. What's happening? And welcome to The Ladies... Uh, The Lord's Man Show. Um... So, I understand that you are a nun? - Yes, that's right. - Yeah, that's cool. "And how long have you been, uh, nunning it up? For about 30 years now. Yeah. Well, congratulations. That's good. Now, I understand that your work... takes you all around the world, is that right? Yes, that is correct. In fact, I'll be leaving the country... very soon to assume a missionary position. I'm sorry. What was that? I'm going to assume a missionary position, and I'll probably be holding it for a very longtime. Yeah, well, that's... that's interesting. Um... So, where will you be holding this... - Missionary position? In Bangkok. - Yeah. Bangkok. Yeah. That's, uh, cool. So why don't we talk about something else. Bangkok is lovely. In fact, I'm looking forward to taking it all in. Hmm. But it can get a little steamy. Have you ever gone down the Yellow River? Yeah, once in the '80s, but I did not enjoy it. What about a missionary position? Have you ever known the joys of a missionary position? Yeah, okay. Here's a story I'm gonna tell you. It goes a little something like this. I was with these two girls, right? And so I was doing the twin sisters and then her mother walks in, and her mother has a video camera. So she puts it on the tripod and she starts to ram it. It was sort of a missionary position... Yeah? Well, up yours too. Oh, well, on to the next one. Next one? There is no next one. That's nonsense, Julie. There's that kiddie station up in Wilmette. Leon, we may never work in radio again. No, listen, Julie. That is where you are wrong. We'll get out of this mess. Trust me. Last time I trusted you, you told the city of Chicago to do it in the butt. Yeah. Well, there was no way to predict that that was gonna end up so badly. - But look, it'll be different this time. - Whatever, Leon. I need to think this through. You call me when you come back to reality. Don't you worry, Julie. I'm a man of action. I have a plan for this type of thing. There's only one thing to do. I'm must go and have sex... and wait for something to randomly happen. It'll work out, you'll see. It will randomly work out! Score! Score! Score! Yeah. Whoo! Well, I just had sex, and... - U.S. Mail. - There's the random occurrence. I hate the houseboat guy. Hey, what's happenin'? Shh. I was bonin' a lady inside. Say, look at this. It's a telegram from Jimmie Walker. - Really? - Ooh, it says, "Urgent." "Dear Leon. Stop. The '70s are over. Stop." Let me see that. Here's your... Oops. I seem to be dropping all your mail. - I guess I'm a clumsy mailman. - You're a bad mailman. And this is not from Jimmie Walker. Let's see here. Gas bill. Houseboat bill. Electrical bill. Ooh, what is this? Ooh. It's a lady. "Dearest Leon, I know it's been a long..." "My back pressed against the washing machine..." "Money..." This is it! "Dearest Leon, I know it has been a longtime since we parted ways that fateful night, but I still remember the tender moments we spent together. The feeling of your skin pressed up against mine. The feeling of my back pressed up against the wall of the Laundromat. I remember how you said I was your one true love. Time has changed nothing. I want you even more. And I have all the money we'll ever need to make a fresh start. Come back to me, Leon. I'm waiting for you... and I've never stopped thinking of myself... the way you always used to describe me... as your very special Sweet Thing." - You gotta be kidding me. - Uh... uh. This is the answer to all your unemployment problems? - Who is she? - I don't know. - You don't know? - Uh-uh. As you can see, she did not sign her name, so I guess she thought I knew who she was. Cuckoo, cuckoo. Yeah. All I know is that all my problems, they are now solved. Leon, all your problems will be solved when you get a job like normal people. How am I supposed to do that? We tried every radio station in town. Not every one. I can still pull a favor, hopefully, over at WAMS from Cyrus. Cyrus Cunningham? Your ex-fiance? The one that dumped you? The one with the three-inch penis? No, Julie, listen. I can't stand the idea of you... crawling back to that jerk just because I got both of us fired. Listen, baby, the answer to all of our troubles... is in this rich lady's letter and her money. Her money. Leon, this is a love letter, not a lottery ticket. This is a woman who cared for you, who you called by a special pet name. - Who you called... - Hey, sweet thing. Hi. Can I get some more waffles down here? Thank you. I'm sorry. What were you saying, sweet thing? I'm, uh... I'm sorry about the door. Do I have the right place? I was just... Wow! You're huge. We know who you are, Barney. I think you'll be glad that you decided to come. What... What is this? - These are people just like you, Barney. - Hi, Barney. They, too, have had their lives shattered... by the sight of that man's ass. I caught this mysterious tattooed guy and my wife going at it... in July, 1992. Spring of '89. December, 1994. November of '95. And then April of '96. And then again in June of '96. And then twice more on January 15,1997. And three more times in the spring of '99... Arbor Day, Cinco de Mayo and Flag Day. That's Hal. Don't make any sudden moves around him. It's all right, man. What about you? I mean, what's your story? It was April, 1990. I was in training for the U.S. Olympic Team. My Sport: Greco-Roman wrestling. My wife and I didn't have a perfect marriage. Maybe I didn't understand her needs. But she definitely didn't understand my passion... for wrestling. She didn't understand why Brian, my wrestling partner, and I... trained constantly. She didn't understand the thrill any man would feel... after grabbing a big, husky guy like Brian... and pinning him down to the ground... until he squirms and squeals like a little piglet. One night, I went out to train... at... at Brian's. I returned home only to find my wife lying there... with a faraway look. I noticed an open window, and out of it I saw our man running through the parking lot. I would've chased after him, but I was too sore. From the training. Of course, the training. Right. After that, I discovered there were others like me, and I formed this group. The point is, we may not know his name, but we're onto him. And one day, he'll slip up. And when he does, we're gonna be there to nail him... and cut his balls off! Okay, sorry. Sorry, everyone. Maybe we won't actually go that far. That's yucky. Well, you don't have to wait for him to slip up. He already has. 'Cause when he ran out of my apartment... Look! He's a circus clown! Yeah, we already know about the clothes. He runs out of all of our houses bare-assed, you know. The clothes really haven't given us anything. What? Damn it! I mean, there must be some way to catch this woman's dude. Gentlemen, prepare for battle. Listen up, everybody. This will be... our general area of our search, okay? Now, years ago I was in the army, and we spent a lot of time in this area here. The army, they called it Asia, but I like to call it Freaky-Deeky Sex World. Scrap Iron, you're my man. This will be your area. [suggest that... you stick to the back streets and the whorehouses. - I'm right on it. - Good. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Scrap, wait a minute. Leon. This postmark is from Chicago. - Hey. - Let me see that, Lester. If the lady lives right here in Chicago, that ought to be easy. I mean, you could find all the women you been with in town, right? That's a very good question, Candy. Yes, I can, because I have written the names of all of my very special sweet ladies down... in this, my black book. - Look at that thing. - And in addition to that, I have made these photocopies for you all to take a look at. - That's for you, Lester. - You have any idea who this woman is? Yes, I do, because when I read this letter... I hear a voice that I connect to a face. And because I have what is called 20-20 memory, that tells me that this is my very special Sweet Thing. Leon Phelps. - You miserable, fatheaded jackass. - Theresa! What the hell are you doing here? I hoped you were dead. No, I'm not dead. Surprise. - Ew! - What? You expect me to let you stick your tongue in my mouth after two years? Yes, I do. Ooh, Courvoisier. Let's have a drink. Come on in, baby. This is nice. Leon, why haven't you called me? This is the thing. They kept changing all those collect call phone numbers, so it became really difficult for me to use the telephone. - Shut it up. I can't believe this. - Okay. I meet you under the stands at a dog track. You sweet-talk me into leaving. Next thing, I'm busting slobs with you in a bathroom of a Chuck E. Cheese. You called me your sweet thing. Wait a second. It says here we did it in a Laundromat. - What? - Yeah. Didn't you send me a note about getting together and sharing your money, love? Mistakes are sometimes funny. Listen, I could really use that drink now. All right, that's nice. I got everything but the glass. - Rot in hell, Leon. - Yes, I heard you the first time. No, no, no, no, no. I hope you burn in hell. - Yes, duly noted. - Rotting and burning. - Yes, in hell. I got you. - Your mother looks like Florida Evans, ya scrub! Listen, there's no reason to go there. You mud duck! Quack on. Hey, Sandra, it's me, Leon. What's happening? - Hey, Margie. What's up? It's Leon. - Hi. How you doing? Good to see you. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Yeah, I know you gotta go. - Listen, did you write this letter? - What? No? Okay. Go on up there. Have a good time tonight. Play some Al Green and smack her on the ass. She likes that. Hey. How you doin'? Hey, what's happening, Evelyn? I remember... That was not a good idea. What's happening, Chicago? Ladies, if you are rich and I boned you, could you please meet me at the nacho cart? Also, if you are rich and you want to be boned, would you please meet me at the nacho cart? - Hey, Lester. - I stepped in a time machine. Look at this place. This place is disgusting. You don't have to stay long. just long enough to meet Leon. I'm telling you, he's just what your station needs. - Leon, this is Cyrus. - Cyrus Cunningham. Yeah, this is the guy that dumped you. Leon, you're a lot shorter than I expected. But the hair and the shoes help out. Well, Julie, sweetheart, I said I would meet your friend, and I have. And I've wasted a lot of my time in the process. Obviously, you haven't grown up much since our little mistake. Look, Cyrus, why don't you just listen for a second? WAMS has done quite well without the help of rejects... and winos and ditsy women who think they can run with the big boys. Listen, if you need a temp job, let me know, okay? Gotta go. Love your place. Listen, don't talk to Julie like that. Excuse me. What was that, little man? I said that you don't talk to Julie like that. Don't push up on me in front of your peeps, okay? Don't let the smooth taste fool you. I'm from the streets. Oh, yeah? Well, I still live in the streets... and will occasionally find myself waking up in the streets. That's right. That's right. Gentlemen, there will be no fighting in this bar. All right, fine. We can take it outside. Listen, I'm sorry. We... We got off on the wrong foot here. Um, why don't we just let bygones be bygones? Whatever you say, sugar. That's fine with me. Listen, how about you have a... I'd like to offer you a pickled pig's feet. I don't think so. Come on, johnny Mathis. - You said you from the streets. - Yeah. Yeah, well, Julie told me that while they were datin', there were some things that Cyrus didn't have a taste for. - Interesting. - Hey, hey, hey. It ain't no thing, all right? It ain't no thing. I was raised on pig's feet. I can eat this. Fine. I can eat it. If this is what you want, fine. - This is what you want me to do? - Mm-hmm. Just to impress you and the rest of the Sunshine Band, I'll eat it. That's fine. See? I'll eat it here. Cut it up a little bit and eat it like that. See? There. Perhaps you thought I'd recoil from your bar food, but... - You want some pickled eggs? - I'd love some pickled eggs. That'd be nice. One pickled dish at a time. Why are we gonna... Okay, I'll stay for one pickled egg. Look, everybody. People are actually eating the bar food. All right, boys, eat up. The food is free. - It disappears. - Pickled egg you want, pickled egg you got.

What possible holiday would you bottle human shit for? - Funniest idea yet! - You people are sick! That's the first time it's ever worked. We scored so big. You know that that was our last chance at a steady paycheck. - Mm-hmm. - But I feel good. I feel real good. Well, that's good, because listen, there's no way... that I was gonna let that dude disrespect my Julie twice. So, listen, excuse me. I will be going to the bathroom to puke up a hog ball.

And when you find him, tell him to come in and pick up this crap. - What's this? - Fan mail... from all the sluts he's been banging for the past couple of years.

His name is Leon Phelps. - He also goes by "The Ladies Man." - Yeah! - You guys friends of his? - You might say that. We want to kill him. Well, he doesn't hang out here.

Your friend Leon has made some suggestions... pertaining to us and our love life. I'm so glad you invited Leon here to spend this time with us. I didn't invite Leon... As far as I'm concerned, he can stay as long as he wants. - I'll drink to that. - I do too. If you got some Courvoisier, we could pour some of that in here too. Julie, when am I gonna see your room?

You know whose fault it is, don't you? It is the fault of the Wang. I should cut this thing off. - You're not gonna cut it off. - I know. That's the craziest thing I've ever thought of. But I just can't live like this anymore. I'm so tired of being "The Ladies Man." You know, you were never "The Ladies Man" to me. - Really? - Really. No, to me you've always been just plain old Leon Phelps. A lonely, misguided... idiot. You know something Julie? Hmm? I think that you wrote the mystery letter. Yeah! Leon, I've never had sex with you, especially not in a Laundromat. Yeah, that is true. You know what? It would've been really nice if you had written this letter. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. You know, a girl like you, that's what I need. I don't need some crazy mystery lady. Well, how could you find a girl like me? Yeah, how can I find a girl like you? She'd have to be single. - That would be really nice this time. - Yeah. And she'd have to be attractive. Yeah, well, you have that. She'd have to have parents that wouldn't throw you off the porch.

In most cases, it was really good. - Kill! - No, hold on! But listen, I didn't force myself onto your women. I simply gave them somethin' that you all wasn't givin' them. - Like Frank. You, for instance. - Yeah? - Your wife, she loves you, man. - She does? Yes. She always used to call your name when I was rockin' on top of her. - She did? - Yeah. And Hal. - Me? - Hal, Hal, Hal.

There's nothing really else to say about that. I think you all know that. That's cool. But you were tryin' to oil me up, and that's not really cool. You all need to listen to your ladies. You need to say to her, "Baby, what is it that you want?" Or, "Do you want to do it in the butt? No? Okay, well, let's move onto somethin' else." You just need to listen to your ladies. I know that now, because I too have a woman that I love. Her name is Julie, and I never listened to her. I was too busy trying to be "Leon Phelps, The Ladies Man," instead of Leon Phelps, the man. - Leon... - Just a second Julie, I got these... Julie! That was beautiful.
