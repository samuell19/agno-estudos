This is Ella, my best friend at the Otto Leonhard School. Hello. Wanna ride? Sure. Chris and Robert are also part of the gang. Formation complete. We saved the Otto. And of course Mario is with us too. Hey. Hey Mario. Hi. Our School has become much more colorful and happy since then. And the highlight has to be the Otto Leonhard learning course. They say you don't even notice that you're learning here but you end up understanding stuff much better anyway. And you know what? Schmitty is really chill now. Well, at least she's trying. If I'm a hurry, you help me at once and if I'm feeling bored, I do sports with you. Riders need their horses and smokers their ashtrays. Gardeners love the soil and earth and I love my... Ashtray? Huh, ashtrays? Calculator. My calculator. My calculator is very, very important to me. I know this is an English class I'm substituting but this was meant to be a little example of a poem about something that is meaningful to us. I want you to get together in groups of four or five and try to write such a poem, okay? Alright, let's go! So what do you think? Write a poem. Better than a dictation exercise. Alright, so what's really important for all of us. I like anything that flies. 'Cause you're always winging it with your schoolwork? Ha ha, you're a bunch of jokers. How about our parents? Uncool. But they are important to all of us, don't you agree? Well. It really depends on how we approach it right? ♪ Hey man ♪ ♪ If your parents rant around ♪ ♪ Close your ears and fade them out ♪ ♪ And if they start threatening ♪ ♪ You don't have to hear a thing ♪ ♪ Take your phone and throw a fit ♪ ♪ We'll listen, I don't give a ♪ That's a load of crap. What? Why? Mario's right. Parents was a stupid idea. It was your idea. Yeah, still, let's think of something else. Okay. Alright, what else is there? Music, music's good. Nah. The internet? Nah. Friendship. Friendship is good. So are we still on for this afternoon? What? We were going to meet. Crap, that's right. Totally forgot. Sorry. Watch it. Hey. What's with him? See you tomorrow okay. Mario, wait up. Ella is kinda glued to him lately. Why are you jealous? Me? Of course not. Yeah right, of course not. Ah! Oh, Mr. Michalsky. Wonderful. Just wonderful, our new Otto Leonhard Museum. Straight A with a star. We have to drink to this sometime soon with a nice glass of... Sage tea. Absolutely. Well then, I'll finish cleaning up and we're all set for the parents council meeting on Saturday. Don't worry. And hopefully they'll approve the money for the Otto Leonhard School concept. It's hard to say no to you Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein. I'm not sure if this belongs here. Ah, I found it when I was cleaning the learning course. I'm afraid these are the sad remains of Hulda Stechbarth. Hulda Stechbarth? Yes, you know, after he shrunk her back then. That horrible teacher who wanted to take his school away from him. I would prefer it if you'd get rid of it. I'll take care of it. Thank you Mr. Michalsky. Very good work. Really outstanding. Have a nice evening. Thanks. You too Headmistress. Thank you. Agh! Oopsie! Ah, dammit! Ah, oh. Ah. Ah. There we go. Better. Hi Dad. Hey. Are you cooking? Cooking? Ah, yes, there's something in the stove. You know that Mom will be here any minute right? Ah! Ah no. Give me a hand for a second. Okay. Thanks, you're the best! Let's go. Hurry up Dad! Okay. Hello my boys! Hi Mom. Hi pretty lady. How was your day? Great. Mm, something smells weird. Ah, did you try to cook? Oh! Oh, well what counts is that you tried. Yes, I have something important to talk to you guys about. Well, we can't eat that. We'll find something else. Did you go shopping? Come on Peter, we agreed that you would do more at home while I'm at work. Okay, family meeting. Sit down, please. Oh, okay. Okay. So, since you've been back from New York I've been kind of treading water. I don't get it. Me neither. Professionally. I'm not really moving forward career wise and so I've decided to apply for a job. Okay. As a structural engineer. Okay. In Dubai. What! You want to leave! But Peter, we've just been through that. I know, I know. And that's why I thought that this time we can all move together. - Uh. - Move to Dubai. No way, I'm staying here. Alone? Felix, you're a bit too young for that. Dad, all my friends are here. Okay, okay stop. Nobody's going to Dubai for now. Hey, how can you say that? You've just been abroad yourself. Yes, and that's why everything here is upside down now. Come on Peter, it's total chaos. Chaos, what chaos? Just because we're not playing by your perfect rules you mean? What's that supposed to mean? Don't fight! We're not fighting. Everything's fine. I just think that Felix and I might have created our own rules in the meantime. And what kind of rules are we talking about? Use the kitchen as a workshop. Never eat regularly. I'm getting us a pizza. - No. - Yes, good idea. Here, take my wallet. Honey, I just think it's time for it to be my turn. Ciao Felix. Hey Giulio. All good? My parents are bugging me. Hmm, pizza diabola. What? Good for constipation, cold feet and sorrow. Here, take it. It'll all work out. Yeah for sure, thanks. Ciao Felix. Hmm. First, you don't pay me any attention. Then you shrink me. And all you left me with are these old bones. But now I'm here again and I'll pay you back every cent and every penny Otto Leonhard. Who was that? Who? Me? Where? Here. And here. Or here. And here. Leonhard! Kudos to you Miss Stechbarth. You lost weight, suits you much better. I almost didn't recognize you. Do you have to chatter out of that bust now too? Admit it, you've missed my voice haven't you? Certainly not! No offense, but you aren't even skin, just bones and I'm a ghost. Given these rather complicated circumstances, how do you figure you'll take revenge on me? Just you wait and see. You need soup made of hyena mane. Eyes of a bullfrog. Rabbit dung! You, you want to transfer your dark soul onto the school building? Yes! And I'll use the potion from your old friend Chief Chentopki. Outrageous! I am the acting ghost at this school! Well, not for long. Here! Oops, sorry! I'll get it. Really, spider girl to the rescue. Do you see that crack? It wasn't there yesterday. Well that was the power of my swing. Dream on hulk. Maybe an undercurrent or a ground movement. Attention! Tower to Felix. Roger. Hey pass it here. Hey pass it here. Nice one. Here. Got it. Ouch, geez Chris. Oops, sorry. Felix. Whoops. See. This wasn't here yesterday. And this. And this. This doesn't look good. And now of all times with the parents council meeting coming up and all. Well, what can you do. We'll need an architect to take a look at this. Just to be on the safe side. Go on Mr. Mickalsky, make sure to document it all. With pleasure. Felix. - Felix I have to talk to you. - To me? Yes. Do you think you could do without your parents for one afternoon. Not only for one afternoon. What? - What do you mean? - It was just a joke. Yes, well I have something really urgent to discuss with them. Could you let them know. Yeah, sure. - What's it about? - Yes, well I'd rather discuss - it with them. - Morning. - Morning. - Morning. Alright, I'm leaving. Have fun kids. Great. What did she want? I don't know, maybe something about my math test. But I thought you had a good feeling. Hmm, yeah I did. Alrighty dearest friends and esteemed colleagues. What is this? Kas-Kasey, Kesto what is this? What kind of structure do we see here? Anyone have a clue. Nobody? This is... A catastrophe. Looks like a spider web and it all leads directly to the Otto Leonhard Museum. Hulda Stechbarth! How did you get into that picture? Are you haunting this place and breaking stuff. I will not allow it. What are you doing? Stop it, this is dangerous! Hey Dad! Hey! Hi Mom. Hello. Schmitty wants to talk with you. What? Did something happen. I don't know. She said it would be best if you could come in this afternoon. Oh, that sounds serious. Yes, Felix sit. Sit down for a minute. Why? Because your mother and I have something we also want to tell you. Well, I've given it some thought and Dad deserves the same opportunities that I've had. After all, you made it possible for me to spend a year in the US. What! Yes, we're going to Dubai. Well, Dad is going to apply - for a position first. - Yes, yes. Then we'll see. It's just fair, don't you think. What exactly about this is fair? Here. So look, there's a pool with a big slide and there's a park with sheiks. And there. Yes, so look, we can all do camel rides in the desert and you can go to an international school. They even have a car service. Felix, there is a skyscraper that is over 800 meters tall. You can't just decide something like that. I don't want to go to Dubai. I don't need parks with sheiks. I don't need water slides, or international schools. Felix. Dad, my friends are here, and the Otto. No matter what happens we're here for you. Then leave me out of this Dubai crap. Man. Damn. I worry about Felix. Maybe we're asking a little bit too much of him. Yeah, but I mean a year abroad. This could be a huge adventure for him. Yes, but Dubai. I don't know Peter. Once we're there he will like it. Believe me. When I was a kid I would have traveled to the end of the world for a pool like. Whoa. Ah, fudge with nuts. Um, we should go back to the car and get the hard hats. Yes. Hi Felix. Hey Ella. What are you up to? Oh I'm just hanging around. Are you okay? My parents. They want us to move away. What! But why? What is this? Peter? I, I don't know. 3-D art? Help. Don't you dare! You will regret this Leonhard. I will erase you. Every tiny memory of you will be, oh! Stechbarth's the name. What can I do for you? What... What was that? Excuse me. Right now they're probably telling Schmitty that they're de-registering me from the Otto. They can't do that. But they will. They're the grownups with all the insights. Um, er. So what brings you to this school. We're looking for Headmistress Schmitt-Gössenwein. Unfortunately Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein will not be available anymore. But we have an appointment. We, we need to talk to her urgently. This school needs to be closed down immediately. Hmm. Looks like we agree on something for a change Leonhard. I wish it was the other way around for once and that they would have to do everything I say. Let Schmitty back then, you don't want that. I do, that's exactly what I want. Oh my God. What happened? This woman is huge. Oh come on, she's not that much taller than me. It's just the heels. That was the last time you shrank someone Leonhard. Actually I wanted to ask if you wanted to meet up today. Today's difficult. I already have plans. Yeah, with who? With Mario. What's going on lately with you and Mario? Nothing, we just wanted to hang out. Can't you cancel it. No sorry, I promised. So he doesn't get blown off! Hey Mario has some stuff going on too. I don't give a damn about Mario right now. Felix, don't be such a jerk. Maybe we can-- Ah to hell with you, all of you. Seriously! Felix! Mom. Dad. Hmm. That's weird. Ugh, typical. Hi Mom, where are you guys? Dad left his phone at home and you're not answering. Just call me back. Hmm. Let me recap. The year is 2018. I have been dead for over 100 years. The school is being led again according to Mr. Leonhard's silly ideas and children today aren't raised properly anymore. Not corporally punished is what I said. Same difference. Will you let us go now? Certainly not. Why not? We haven't done anything to you. Yeah, what are you gonna do now? Have you ever wondered why the old scatterbrain is still haunting this building? How he can maintain his incredible strength after all these years? Who? Otto Leonhard. Because we are all thinking of him. Everything here reminds us of him. Everybody admires him, even though he couldn't care less about other people. But this is all about to end. You see. Without his sphere, he's already looking pretty tired and when I'm done with him, nothing will be left to remember him by and he will be weak enough for me to take over the school finally. Ugh! How I hate this old body. I really need to become the school ghost soon before it collapses entirely. Peter! Oh, oh god, Peter! Crap. Something's not right. Oh, when I came back from the US, Felix told me that the Otto is even weirder than he could say. Do you think he knows anything about these strange things that are happening? Yes, we should have listened to him more. Peter, hey, Peter. Can you stop rattling around like that, you're making me nervous. Yes, but I need to do something. I want to get out of here, I can't just sit around. Well that's not the way. Okay, let's just calm down and think for a moment. Alright, go ahead. Okay. So this is a cage and a cage is not built for someone to get out of. So we'll stay in here, is that what you're saying? No, that's nonsense. Please just be reasonable for once? Oh sure, the old hog shrinks us to the size of legos but I'm not being reasonable? Huh? Of course. That's it! There is one way, our tiny weight can make a big difference. Swing of course! That's it! Yes. Honey, this is an amazing idea. On three. - Yes. - Okay. Come on. One, two, three. No, honey it's not gonna work like that. - I'm feeling dizzy. - Keep walking! Come on, come on! What was that? Watch out! Mom. Dad. Are you alright? Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein. Schmitty! Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein! Is anybody here? Schmitty! Felix! Felix. Hello? Who's there. Felix? What are you doing here at this hour? Mr. Mikhalsky. Have you seen my parents. No. But Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein wanted to talk to them because of the cracks in the building. I'm sure they'll be a while. Oh I see. I was just wondering where they were. Oh. Don't worry! They're big enough to take care of themselves now. Right, you're right. Bye Mr. Mikhalsky. Bye Felix. Oh, oh, not again! Are you alright? Yes, thank god. It's a miracle that we survived that. Don't make yourself so heavy. And how are we supposed to get home now. There! There's Felix. Felix. Felix. Felix. Felix. Felix. Oh! Oh! Adelheid, think logically. Every problem has a solution. How do I get out of the learning course? Ah, ah, right. I have to solve the task. I know this. That's what my music teacher sounded like too. We've walked for three hours. It'll take us days to get home. What else can we do? Hey! Watch out, will ya! Oh, oh. - Honey. - Hmm. I know we can get home. Marco's Pizzeria. Yes, hello. Thank you. Ciao. There you go. Good evening, dear colleague. You, how did you get here. I'm elated that I finally found you. You put me in this position in the first place. Why aren't you inside that picture anymore? I have to say that your impression of me is very much mistaken. We both have Mr. Leonhard to thank for our misfortune. Why should he shrink me? I admire him. Everybody does. But... He's lost his mind. What? I have to stop him. I've already managed to break a big part of his spell. But I could use your help. Give me your body. What's going on with your eyes. My body's too old. It doesn't do what I say anymore. Felix. - Felix. - Felix. Felix. What a sleepy head. Come on already. Felix. Felix. Felix get up. Geez. Finally. Oh no, not you too. That's all you have to say about this. Yeah, I wished for this once before with Schmitty. That was a real nightmare too. We are not a nightmare. What did you wish for? Did Otto Leonhard do this? I told you that Felix knows something. Otto Leonhard the founder of your school? Yes exactly. He's a kind of ghost who defends his school. He shrank Schmitty because the school almost got closed down because of her. And we also wanted to close the school. Wait, this is all a bit too much for me-- Why you want to close the school? Well, haven't you seen the cracks? Oh okay, because of the cracks. Then I just have to explain to Otto Leonhard that you were just worried about the school. So you can help us become our normal size again? I think so. Come on, let's go. What, now? - In the middle of the night. - Yes. Felix, we are super hungry and we really have to go to the bathroom. Yeah, we're also really, really dirty. Wait a minute! You mean I have to wash you, cook your dinner and put you to bed. And, I scratched my knee too. Okay. I really have to use the toilet. Uh, really? Alright. Peter, please! Well what? It's not like I can climb into it. Well I didn't suggest that, but maybe you could-- Show me your knee Mom. Yeah, it's all inflamed. Look. Well, then we'll have to disinfect it. What, no, no! It's not that bad. Yes, yes, yes. That's what you always say when you use that horrible spray on me. No! No Felix, please don't. Felix, please not that. Yes, you know that it's necessary. Alright, brace yourself, here we go. Ah, it burns! It burns! Ooh. But it's good for you. Oh no, I'm all wet now. Hang on, I'll blow dry you. Ah, oh my God Felix, get Dad out of there. Come on, hurry up Felix. Oh my god. Oh. That's disgusting. Okay, I'll give you two a bath. Peter! What? You could do with a shave. Huh? Yes, yes you could. Um, Felix, shaving? Are you sure? I mean this could go really-- Oops. Cool! What? Um, we'll fix that somehow. You look younger like that. Ha ha, very funny. Um, here you go. What are those? Sleeping bags and beds. Here. Where? Mmm, it smells like lawn and weekend and-- Sweaty feet. Yes, cool. Ella, call me back. Sleep well and tomorrow you'll be big again. Night Felix. And thanks for everything. Felix, there was something else when we were at your school. Something really, really weird. This woman named-- Yeah, what was her name? Hulda. Hulda Stecker-something. Hulda Stechbart. - Yes, exactly. - Exactly. She's been dead for a long time. Someone must have played a joke on you. - Don't think so. - Yeah well. She did look very, Alive. And she wanted to get rid of every memory of Otto Leonhard. What! Now you're telling me! I have to let Schmitty know. Now? Yes. Felix. Felix. Felix. Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein. One moment. Where else. Hello. Hello? Is someone here? Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein? What are you doing here? The front door was open. That's no reason to just enter someone else's house in the middle of the night. Well what are you doing here then? This is Schmitty's house. She's on leave until further notice. Really? Do you know how I can reach her. No! I do not. Anything else? No I don't think so. Have a good evening. Miss Stechbarth. How do you know my name? So it is you. We'll meet again. Huh? Who was it? Just someone who got the address wrong. At this hour? You could trust me a little more. Why would I have taken you home if I didn't have only your best interest at heart? Mmm? Well you see. Us career gals need to stick together or we'll just end up with another ignorant male telling us what to do. Alright, so if you really want to lead this school in the spirit of Otto Leonhard and since I'm incapacitated right now. That's what I've been trying to tell you. Just run me through all the things that are left from the old crank and I'll make sure everything will be taken care of. In the spirit of my, our educational education. There's one appointment that's very important. Yes? This Saturday the Parents Council has to approve the funding for the Otto Leonhard school concept. Would you mind taking up the learning course, the museum and our participatory teaching approach? But of course! With pleasure. And what happens if the Parents Council doesn't give its approval? Well. Then we can't afford to preserve Otto Leonhard's legacy anymore. All these things that make this school so special. How great! I mean, what a catastrophe. What a great catastrophe. I don't know what kind of game you're playing here. Ho! You brought this on yourself. Oh! Oh! Time to get up. What? Already? We're in a hurry you guys, we have to look for Schmitty. I brought you something to eat. Unbelievable. Okay. Five minutes. Crap! Get up! Hurry, we overslept. Get up, let's go. We have to go to school. What? Huh? Didn't you mention food. I'm starving. Yes, I brought you something. Oh, cool and did you wash our clothes too? Oops. But we can't look like this. You're right. Where's that box. I'm always hungry when I wake up. Then I eat and I'm sleepy again. Oh whatever. Okay, enjoy. A happy meal? Yeah, well a big Mac would be a bit much for you wouldn't it? For breakfast? Mom, we're in a hurry. Stechbarth's real, she's this kind of zombie who wants to take over our school. Ugh. Hmm, yum. But doesn't it come with a toy. Dad! Who's calling at this time? It's a really long number. It could be Kassler from Dubai. Felix can you hand me the phone. I think you're too small for your own phone. But Felix. Yeah well I had to listen to that sentence for years. Frontman. Felix this is important. Yes it's me. Hmm, why is he already calling you? Didn't you say you still had to apply. I just made an informal inquiry. Very informal. No, I can't accept the job today. Felix. Peter. Honey this is a unique opportunity. Yes, it's because of my family you see. It's not so easy. Yes I'll get back to you. Goodbye. And when were you planning on telling me about this? But you agreed. Yes, but I didn't know how hard it would be on Felix. Could you stop fighting please. - I have to call him back. - Felix give me the phone. No Felix, don't. Why can't you support me for once. Hey, you munchkins are on a time out. We really have more important stuff to worry about. Hi Ella this is Felix again. Pick up will ya. I'm eating my fries. What's this? Fascinating. You're not giving up yet Leonhard. Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein? There you are. Mr. Michalsky, I assume. Yes. What are you doing here? Where's the headmistress? Ill. Is it bad. So you're the janitor? Facilities manager. Right, a manager, of course. We're going to have to change a few things around here. First I want you to clean out the Otto Leonhard Museum. But we just finished building it. Well, now you'll clear it out again. Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein and I want to present the Parents Council with a new concept. Well if that's what you want. And then, I would like to have the keys to the tower chamber. I don't have them with me. The tower chamber hasn't been in use for years. It's very remote. You don't say. Get me the keys janitor! Facilities manager. Sure, sure. Alright now. Off you go. Lickety split. Chop chop. Okay. I'll have to put you in here. What! No, no I can't, I'll be sick. Come on. Schmitty survived it too. How else should I take you with me on my skateboard? You want to skate with us? What do you want with those? No, that's really not okay. Not the car. Felix, we're glad that you're so-- So sensible. Yes. Your car is at school. Don't you remember? - At school? - Right, of course. Huh, what's that? Seatbelt and helmet. You know how it is. Mmm, smells like chocolate. These smell scrumptious. Are we there yet? Ha ha, very funny. I have to pee? Really? Couldn't you have done it at home? Yes, but at home I didn't have to pee yet. You have way more room than me. Ow! Felix, Mom is being mean to me. Watch it, traffic light. You're driving me crazy. Can't you just be quiet back there. Really Ella? It's green. Wasn't that Felix? Don't know. His parents are also giving him a hard time. They want to move abroad. At least they're still together. Why don't you tell the others that your parents are separating? I don't want to whine. They'd think I'm a bozo. Nonsense. We're a gang, we're friends. And anyway, you told me too. Because you were the one who asked. The others don't get anything. It's really crappy when nobody notices that you're feeling like hell. I don't think they have bad intentions. Believe me, they mean well. Just a little bit longer until we're inside. Hey Felix, there you are. - Finally. - Hey. Guys, I'm late. I just need to take care of something. Do you know where Ella and Mario are? Nah, they're still making out. - Ugh. - Respect. Huh, what's going on here? Okay, come on out. Mr. Leonhard, can you hear me? My parents didn't really want to close your school they were just worried about the students. Absolutely. Yes, we're actually your biggest fans. Are you feeling okay? The sphere is gone. What sphere? It's always been in here. Yeah, I remember, it moved around and then it-- Burned. Exactly. Hulda Stechbarth has it. Oh crap. We need it. Where are you going? I'll be right back. Stop. Felix. Aargh. Hey here they are, our lovebirds. Cute. What the hell? Are you finished? What do you mean? Felix told us that he caught you making out and stuff. What? Oh Felix, thank god! You are shrunken too! What do you mean too? Just like my parents. I've tried to talk to Otto Leonhard to get him to make them big again. But his sphere is gone. Yes, yes! Hulda Stechbarth has it. She wants to lock it away in the tower chamber so it will be as far away from Otto Leonhard as possible. What are you doing? I'm getting you out of there. Oh Felix, please be careful. I'm always careful. Yeah. Did you see that? Otto Leonhard is getting worse. It's all Hulda Stechbarth's fault. She's taking away his power by destroying his life's work and her coup de grace will be the Parents Council meeting. You mean he can die? Well I mean disappear. If everything that reminded us of him is gone and if nobody thinks of him anymore, then he will be, well nothing. Then we need the sphere immediately. Felix, the tower chamber is like a fortress. There are three heavy doors and we don't have the keys and-- And least a hundred steps. Dear colleague. The janitor will undertake this cumbersome errand for me. Janitor? Mr. Mikhalsky. He won't help you, absolutely not. You think so? You, you can't do that. This is really dangerous. Run Felix run. Frontman you idiot. Mario, what's going on? What kind of garbage are you spreading? What? That Ella and I, you know. Well you're always hanging out together lately, so. So what? None of your business. You don't get anything! I get enough. But I really need to get going. But I do. What are you crazy? I really don't have time for this, dude. Alright, you made it, you can come out now. Everything okay. All good? Are you feeling okay again? Mm hmm. Really? All good. Listen. What was that fight about with Mario? I thought you two were friends. Yes, but, for some reason everything's going wrong lately. Sweetie. If we can help you somehow. Yeah, but how? Well, we're your parents. Yes. I'm actually starting to really need you as my parents too. We'd also love to be normal parents again. I need my friends. I can't get you to your normal size on my own and now Schmitty's shrunk too. Ella I need to talk to you it's urgent. What does it say here? Mm. Obedience, diligence, order and cleanliness are the backbone - of your education. - Forget it. Apparently completely forgotten. Take out your Latin books. Yes. But, according to our schedule, we have biology, not Latin. We have Latin when I say so. Talk back to me again and it's five strokes on the palm of your hand, understood? You're not allowed to do that. I decide, what I'm allowed to do, not you. Tomorrow, the Parents Council will approve my new school concept. And then it's goodbye learning course or participatory teaching. But that's the opposite of what Otto Leonhard would have wanted. Indeed! Get up! Hold out your hand. Ella there you are. What do you want? I know you're upset because I said that stuff about you and Mario. Why did you? Well I saw you and it looked as if you were, you know. Are you actually jealous? Me? What? No. I need to talk to you about something. Geez Felix. I hung out with Mario because he's feeling really bad because his parents are getting a divorce. Really? Oh crap that's tough. Why didn't he say something. Because he didn't want to. Ella I'm such an idiot, I'm really sorry. Okay and you're here to tell me that. Yeah, well no, because of my parents. Are they getting divorced now too? No, but they're shrunken and I need your help. They're what? Shrunken, like Schmitty back then, I sent you a picture. Crap Felix, I totally didn't catch that. Of course I'll help you. Thanks. We need climbing gear. Sure, no problem. And Chris and Robert and Mario. You got it. Cool. Sick, shrunken parents. I like their clothing style. Have you teased them a bit. Sauna in the stove and stuff. Come on be honest. Not on purpose. But it's more like taking care of two little kids. Hey, hey, hey! Hey Mario. Felix. Cool that you're here. About before, I'm really, really sorry. Forget about it. But if the Parent's Council approves Hulda's plan tomorrow and they get rid of the learning course and everything, then it's too late anyway. No it's not, we just have to get ahead of Hulda. Right. And how do we do that? Okay, what's the plan? First we need to get Otto Leonhard's sphere from the tower chamber. Yes and we need to free Schmitty as well. Uh, hello. This all sounds really dangerous. Yes. But Stechbarth, she's not gonna let Schmitty out of her sight. So what do we do? Yeah, but she won't risk it to carry Schmitty around during the council meeting. She'll have to hide her somewhere. Whoa. So we only have one hour. We could help you. You! Why don't we call the seven dwarfs as well. So these are the maps of the school. We would go in here, okay. Who distracts? Okay, this would be here. How can they just over our heads, just decide everything. I mean that's not fair. - Oh really, all of a sudden. - Frontman. What would Felix say do you think? What do you-- Would you be quiet for a moment. Uh, I don't understand, you raised your offer for the position? That's Dubai. I'll get back to you. Goodbye. So? They offered you 30% more money to go with your family to Dubai. 30% on top of their offer. Do you know how much money that is? You guys want to go to Dubai? Nah, not me. But Felix has only been at our school for a year. Yeah and you were just gone for some time and Felix has been missing you a lot. Yeah that's right but-- Some parents are really selfish. Kids, Felix, it's more complicated than that. You can't just-- Okay. You go in here and we go here. But this is, it's just because of the job. So here was where we met. That's where I would enter. The doors our meeting point. Mario and Chris there. You go in here and we go here. Pss, got! See you tomorrow. Bye. Half past eight. Felix, I-- Mario. I really should have noticed that you were feeling crappy. But I guess I inherited not noticing from my father. I can hear you. Hey, your old man is just as cuckoo as mine. Bye. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. Oh, have you ever climbed before? To be honest, I've always been a bit scared of it. Ah, you just have to secure me. That means you're standing on the ground holding a rope. Okay, that should work. - Bye. - Bye. He's gotten so big. From where we're standing, 10 times bigger than before. No, that's not what I meant. Yes, yes I know. You're absolutely right. Alright, there you go. Thanks big guy. Thanks. Aren't you having some too? Yeah, in a minute. I just have to clean the kitchen first. Oh Felix. Yeah. I just wanted to tell you. I understand I can't force you to go to Dubai with me. Uh huh. And, I wouldn't be happy knowing that you, both of you, wouldn't be happy. You mean? I mean... We could always Skype. What's this? What? The TV. Is it a radio with pictures? Yes, you could say that. What a ridiculous invention. Turn it off, we don't need this kind of hubbub. It is of utmost importance that there will be no disturbance tomorrow while the Parents Council meeting is taking place. Can you arrange that? Yes of course. Especially the student Felix Frontman. He is not welcome. Do you understand? But why? I'm sure you want to see your beloved Schmitty again. Mr. Mikhalsky please help me. Please, please don't hurt her. It's entirely up to you. This used to be the control center of the tube mail was it not? Yeah. It's right behind my lumber yard, you can't get to it anymore. Thank you very much. Good morning. Good morning. Again so early. You can sleep in if you want. You're not taking us with you. You saw what happened to Schmitty yesterday it's much too dangerous for you out there. You can't just leave us here. Yes, it's better than risking Hulda catching you. So, we're supposed to sit in these shoes all day long and wait for you to return? You can play with my stuff if you like, but you're grounded. You can't leave the house. Oh. Grounded. We never put you under house arrest. You should be glad that you're not your parents. Whatever. I'm responsible for you now. What are you doing? Safe journey. How do you do? Stechbarth's the name. I'm filling in for Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein. How do you do? Stechbarth's the name. I'm filling in for Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein. How do you do? Stechbarth's the name. I'm filling in for Miss Schmitt Gosenbarth. How do you do? Stechbarth's the name I'm filling in for Miss Schmitt. Yes, yes, how do you do? Stechweins the name, I'm filling in for Miss Schmidt Gossenbarth. Good morning Mr. Mikhalsky. What are you doing here? There's no school today, it's Saturday. Today's Saturday? Are you sure? I could have sworn that it's Monday. Positive it's Saturday. Well, I have to call my parents then. Could you hold this for a second. That's crazy. I could have totally slept in. Nice Chris. Very good. Cool, who's the lookout? I can do it. You go look for Schmitty. When you've got her, we've got the sphere, we meet at the museum. Perfect. Pssst. See you soon. Cheers. Esteemed parents, some time ago the so-called participatory teaching approach has been introduced at the school. What is it? Some children are sneaking around the school. Then go and watch the sphere you idiot. Bit more to the left. Yes, there. Good. Okay, almost. - Great. - Yes. And now, down again. Here take it. Thanks. Here, hook yourself in, like this. Make sure the rope is tightly stretched okay. Let's go. That's just not right. What exactly do you mean? That we're shrunken, or that we shouldn't separate Felix from his friends, or that you shouldn't go to Dubai. Yes, all of it and he can't go through this by himself. Yeah, no, of course not. But he's right when he says that the world out there is much too big and dangerous for us. Yes, honey, but we're still his parents. Yes, but how are we supposed to get to his school? The same way we got here. I could really use a pizza. Unfortunately I have to let you know that the performances of almost every student have horribly deteriorated. And you need to see for yourselves the dangers of our learning course. If you would follow me. Schmitty? Schmitty. Hello. Schmitty. Wow, our German exam. Leave it alone. Hello. Schmitty. Hello. Ella can you see something? There's a little box. I bet the sphere is inside. Crap. Felix, you have to tighten the rope. How, tighten it. I know, I know, Otto Leonhard had only the best of intentions. But see for yourselves, a child got stuck in this tube right here. The fire brigade had to save it after 14 hours. How very interesting. Someone's coming. Oh shit. That was insane. Not bad for a first time climber. What just happened? Michalsky, he totally scared me. He's guarding the sphere. We won't be able to get it like that. Then we have to distract him. Yeah, you have to climb up too, it's the only way. I'll talk to him and you can sneak into the tower from the other side. You want me to climb up there. Nice. Oh god, that's high up. Hold on tight, you're doing great. Oh god, that's high. Don't look down. Turn around slowly. You can do it. Chris, look at this. What is it? A tube mail system. Look there's no dust. Basement? Basement. And this ugly old mushroom fell on half of the fifth grade. A sight that I never hope to see again. If you would follow me into the music room. Felix, give me your hand. Yeah, okay. Okay, see the open window over there, that's where you enter. Yeah I'll distract Mikhalsky okay. Have you lost your mind? What are you doing there. Hello Mr. Michalsky. Nice day today, isn't it? You can't just climb around on the school building. That's not allowed. Why not, I have a climbing license. Ella, for this kind of nonsense I need to take you to the headmistress, I hope you're aware of that. Yes, I'm actually looking for her. Have you seen her? Gossenwein, yes. That's... Felix! Bye Mr. Michalsky. Ella! Felix, don't. You're just making it worse. A student's hand got crushed here. She lost all of her fingers. So if you share my view that Otto Leonhard's ideas are a danger to your children and need to be removed. Then please raise your hand. That's what I thought. Thank you very much. It must be here. Where are the others, where's Schmitty? Hang on, I'll call them. Yes. There she is. Hello, over here. Where are you guys? We're in the workshop. Do you have Schmitty. Not again. Go to the lobby, we'll send her up. What? Our meeting is concluded. Further inquiries only in writing please. Goodbye. This looks like ketchup. Excuse me? This actually is-- Really dangerous. Please be careful. Schmitty. Felix. Thank God your back. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm okay. Mr. Leonhard can you hear me? We brought your sphere back. We need to make Schmitty big again and then we'll go get Hulda. We need you and Schmitty and Felix's parents. Mr. Leonhard. Please, you can't give up. What are we supposed to do without you. It's over. He's gone. You're too late children. Otto Leonhard is history. No way, we won't permit it. Out of my way. I will take Leonhard's place now. Over our dead bodies. Oh yes. And who do you think will de-shrink your parents and your beloved Schmitty? I'm the only one who can do it. So let me through or your parents stay shrunken forever. Pizza? What? One pizza. Not very tasty, but good for the health. A pizza from Marco. Felix? Hey Felix, did you order this. No, but. No, no, that's correct. We want to help you. After all we are your parents. No! Scuze, it's on the house. Now move it or I will crush your parents. Chop chop. So long. You won't recognize this school anymore when I'm done. No, my parents! Oh crap. Kids. You have to get out of here, This building isn't safe anymore. No, I'm not leaving without my parents. Felix, this is about to collapse. Miss Schmitt-Gössenwein, there you are! Come on, I'll get you out of here. No, I'm not leaving without Felix. Then I'm staying too. Mom, Dad! I can't hear you anymore. Why didn't you stay at home. Why couldn't you listen to me for once. Dad? What? The sphere. He needs his sphere. What happened? No idea. I tried to return the power to Otto Leonhard. I hope Hulda doesn't have the sphere now. There you are! Dad and Mom. Felix. Thank god. How did you do that? What have you done? Felix has returned the power to the right school ghost. It was because of your hint. What am I to do in this world. You old fool. So Mr. Leonhard. Yes. Cool. Like a boom box for your phone. First, could you please return my parents and Schmitty to their normal size. Never. Please. Never. But my parents were only thinking about the students when they wanted to close the school. Why don't you let me finish. Never would I entertain the idea to make them small, keep them big, what was your question again? Dad, Mom! Felix. I'm glad it's over. I'm so happy. I'm so relieved. Mr. Mikhalsky. Ooh. You're almost as tall as I am. What are we going to do with Hulda Stechbarth? I think Mr. Leonhard you might have missed how unhappy Hulda was back then. Me? I didn't even know she was teaching at my school until she wanted to succeed me. That's what Schmitty was talking about. Give her another chance. Well I would know a class she would be perfect for. Hi guys. - Hello. - Hey what's up? Haven't you invited Schmitty. Mmm hm. She should be here any minute. Oh look at the time. Have you finished the draft for the renovation of the school? Yes almost. Thanks to the help of your mother. You know what, it's the best project I ever worked on. We want to revive the tube mail system. And an undiscovered part of the learning course. Look here. Look, these corridors, we don't even know exactly where they're going. Wow. So we invited your friends over because we're throwing a party. A 1001 nights farewell party. What? Farewell why? Well a farewell to-- Well to Dubai. Oh Dad. Oh, oh what is it huh?
