[zipper scratching] (T. Hornbein) Risk is a two-sided coin. Sometimes, you win. Sometimes, you lose. [film projector rolling] [applause] I want to, on behalf of all the people of the United States, to express our great appreciation to... for this wonderful effort by our fellow citizens in which man pits himself against his friend and enemy, nature. (Narrator) Of all the mountains in the world, the only that rise about 7,000 meters or 23,000 feet lie in central and south Asia. Of those, only 14 peaks surpass 8,000 meters or 26,200 feet. These 14 peaks, known as the Eight-Thousanders, have long been a focus of climbers worldwide. In 1950, a French team made the first 8,000-meter summit, climbing Nepal's Annapurna. After three decades and a dozen attempts, Mount Everest, the highest of the Eight-Thousanders, was successfully climbed in 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Three years later, in 1956, a Swiss expedition reached the summit, followed by a Chinese expedition in 1960. In 1954, an Italian team summited K2, the second-highest Eight-Thousander. In 1958, Pete Schoening and Andy Kauffman, pulled off the first ascent of Gasherbrum I, making them the only Americans to have climbed an 8,000-meter peak. On the other side of the world, the early 1960s saw an America filled with conflict. The Cuban missile crisis nearly unhinged a world already destabilized by the Cold War. And Americans struggled with civil rights, igniting passion and emotion. But amidst this tension, the allure of the world's highest mountains could not be denied. In 1963, nine people had stood on Mount Everest's summit. Not one of them was an American. With luck, that was about to change. Climbing Everest in 1963, is like launching a military campaign. The logistics are mind-boggling. Gathering all this equipment, packing it, shiploads of equipment and supplies organized and sent halfway around the world in an age when that was not a simple thing. You needed a logistical genius to do this. It was not a simple matter. When I tried to raise money, they said, "The British climbed it. Why do it again?" That was the attitude. And from then on, I really, I started preparing the American Everest expedition. I got a phone call from Norman, that he was putting together a team. Would I like to be a member? I told my wife, "I'm going to be going on a vacation." I got a postcard in the mail from Norman. I wrote him back and said I'd be interested. Part of the genius of Norman is the team he selected. I then worked for three years to organize the expedition, to raise almost half a million dollars. At that time, that was a lot of money. And the team, I had 20 members. (J. Krakauer) Everyone on that team was chosen for their unique talents, that they could contribute. (J. Whittaker) He picked out the best that he could. Looking back on it, he did a pretty good job. You have to give N. Dyhrenfurth a lot of credit to be able to hold this diverse group together. He was very clear about what our obligation was and we took it from there. We're trying to tell a story and it's a story that I'm genuinely interested in and a story that I value a lot myself. Our efforts this year on Everest are mirroring the efforts in 1963. To walk in their footsteps is something I couldn't say no to. A lot has changed in 50 years, but that view hasn't. Being with Jim Whittaker for a return to Mount Everest sparks my curiosity even more about what it was like to be in those places in 1963. It's a special experience to be traveling alongside one of the Americans who really paved this path. Being here with my dad, it's just going to be a great trip. We all found it very special traveling in the Khumbu with him, hearing his stories and his memories as we went. [prayer wheel squeaking] [film projector rolling] In '63, we were the only ones. There were no guest houses, nothing, no other expeditions, no one, but us. (J. Krakauer) Everest now, you fly to the Village of Lukla, 30 miles from base camp. But in '63, they could drive just beyond the outskirts of Kathmandu. And it took them a full month of hard walking every day. At times, it's hard to imagine having really been there. Our feeling was that, if we could get into higher altitude, we'll make it. Everest was constantly, I suspect, on all our minds and constantly part of our group-gathering conversations in the evening. (J. Krakauer) After this long approach, on the third day, Dyhrenfurth called in a team meeting. They agreed on the spot, our main objective is to climb by the Southeast Ridge route. You've got to reach the summit. Then you can play around on the routes. (J. Krakauer) Everyone agreed, including Hornbein. We get it. (J. Whittaker) "Well, okay, but the way to the top maybe should be another route." All the hotshots thought, "We're going to go get the West Ridge." For the same reasons of adventure and the essence of climbing in general. How are you? So we are here in prime season for climbing Mount Everest and everybody has come to the show. Life is simpler and a lot more beautiful. This is my cathedral. I've always wanted to step out of that comfort zone on Everest and get into a little bit of that pioneering feel. This is my 13th or 14th 8,000-meter peak expedition, but this year with the West Ridge is totally different. We're going up there and there's no given of success. There's a tremendous amount of risk still there. A lot of strong climbers have been turned back on the West Ridge. (Jake Norton) The Southeast Ridge and the West Ridge teams will head out of base camp through the craziness of the Khumbu Icefall and into the massive valley of the Western CWM. From there, the Southeast Ridge or South Col Team will follow the route up the Lhotse Face and our route will take a hard left up a steep head wall. (Brent Bishop) If all goes well and the conditions are great, we push up to the West Shoulder and then we move up a couple of thousand feet in elevation gain. And we put up Camp 4W there. From that point, we'll start traversing out along the diagonal ditch and then along a big snowfield face to the Hornbein Couloir which will take us up to Camp 5 West or our high camp. We're going to be facing some technical climbing: ice climbing and rock climbing. No step is given away on that route. (Brent Bishop) And then, we go up to the summit, and then down the Southeast Ridge where the lines are fixed. And if we can get there, we can get home. (J. Krakauer) By the time the Americans arrived at base camp, everyone knew that their first goal was to get someone to the summit. But Hornbein and Unsoeld had their hearts set on climbing the West Ridge. But Willi and Tom thought the West Ridge would go. They knew what could and could not be done. (J. Krakauer) Willi was the climbing leader and he had to have some common sense and judgment. Willi had a real sense of adventure and he liked stepping outside of his comfort zone. (J. Krakauer) He believed that a challenge where success is guaranteed isn't a challenge. He'd rather be out on the unknown, even if he knew there was no chance of getting up it. And that's a fascination. Can you keep pushing even when your body is saying "down, boy, down"? I have a great deal of respect for Willi. Willi had tremendous influence on people. People really admired him. So did I. I have wondered, over the last 50 years, whether Willi's strength was physical or emotional. God, he was unstoppable. Once they decided to attempt the West Ridge, there was competition for resources. Our group, the South Colers, wanted to make sure that we had enough Sherpa and enough bottled oxygen. We had a couple hundred bottles of oxygen for the whole shebang. How that was going to get divvied up was one of the tensions. Norman and Tom tangled quite a bit because of what Tom wanted and what Norman wanted. He said, "Why don't you just skip the South Col route and throw everything into the West Ridge?" So I said, "I worked three years getting this expedition going. What happens if we don't make it?" So I was viewed as a bit of a fanatic in my sort of single-minded focus. Sometimes, I did things with a rather calculated purpose in mind. Hornbein wanted to so badly do that West Ridge, Unsoeld had to hold him down: "Come and take it easy now, Tom." Willi and I complimented each other in a very nice way and I knew that I could be a little bit on the extreme side. And he would be the one that would bring things back into balance. Willi was there, with his hand on his shoulder, and made it all work. Essentially, we became two small teams, one team up to the summit, which we all considered essential, and then the other team to lay a new route up the West Ridge. The whole idea that you could die up there, I don't think anyone was thinking about that until the accident with Jake. (J. Whittaker) When I came in to the base of the mountain and looked at that Icefall, I thought, "Nobody would in their right mind would climb through that." But then, you thought, "We're halfway around the world and we've come to climb Mount Everest. We're going to have to go through that son-of-a-bitching Icefall." The team went up and the block of ice came off, buried Jake, buried Pownall halfway, buried Ang Pema, Sherpa. Jake had the radio. And when we tried to call them and there was no answer, we knew there was trouble. (J. Whittaker) We ran up to find where Jake was. And so Jake was down under at least 30 feet and we couldn't get to him. That Icefall was the only route up the mountain, so it really caused us to seriously think about what we were doing. I think we mourned for a couple of days. We couldn't think straight. Yeah, it was a tough deal. There's always the, "He died doing what he most loved to do." Suddenly, there's an additional purpose. You're not going to turn around and go home. You're going to even focus more on getting the mountain. Jake was 27 years old when he died here and I'm 27 this year. It just makes it very tangible. I never liked the Khumbu Icefall. Only a fool would like it. It's very active. It's a turning glacier. It's moving quite a lot. (David Hahn) Things fall over. Things collapse. [footsteps crunching] [ice crashing] [footsteps accelerating] [Someone coughing] (David Norton) You play the odds when you go through the Icefall and that's all you really can do. (Jake Norton) That collapse kept our attention, but we're all here. We're all good. I was daydreaming about my wife and kid. I'm now back into the fact that I'm at Camp 2 on Everest. Once there was enough supplies at Advance Base, we, the West Ridgers, would have access to those supplies first for reconnaissance. The intention of the reconnaissance was to go up there to see if there was a route to be climbed. And the first few days, we couldn't see our nose in front of our face. Five Sherpas came up and these were mostly Sherpas who were a little bit caught up in the same spirit of just, out there to do something a little different. I can remember Ila Tsering putting a big grin on his face and saying, "Good Sherpas down below. Only bad Sherpas up here." Then the day when we finally got up to where the West Shoulder buts against the West Ridge, we found this incredibly beautiful wind-scoured flat surface of snow right where the shoulder ends and the ridge starts going up. That had to be the most spectacular tent site anywhere on the mountain. It looked like a really tough climb. (T. Hornbein) It was devastating to find that there had been a meeting to decide that we needed to get the mountain climbed and that the West Ridge was going to have to wait. Good job, but you're going to have to wait. All of the carrying power is going to be dedicated to getting the mountain climbed. (J. Krakauer) He didn't think the Southeast Ridge was trivial, but to him, the expedition was about so much more than that. It was about trying something very difficult. Here we are at Camp 2 embarking on the route we've been thinking about for the last year. [exhaling heavily] (J. Norton) We're going to be sinking our teeth into the West Ridge route and seeing what Hornbein and Unsoeld back in '63 saw. Man, damn near 23,000 feet, making our way up to the shoulder. Climbing from Camp 2 to the West Ridge, should be, moderate mountaineering, one-tool climbing, snow, cramp-ons, but this season is a lot different. (J. Norton) We've worked several days up here just on solid blue ice like glass, not very steep, but if you screwed up, you're going down to the bottom. We were thinking we'd get up to the shoulder in just one day and we've spent six calendar days. And most of those have been 12-hour days. (Radio Operator) Hey, Dave, how did the climbing go today up onto the shoulder? Got up to about 6,800 meters. [Breathing heavily] That was an ass-kicker. I'm just hacking. (David Morton) We still haven't made it up to Shoulder and it's starting to get a little discouraging. We can't really put any protection in, anything significant. We'll see. We could be at the end of our rope here. [sniffling] (J. Krakauer) So in '63, the goal was to get an American up Everest via the Southeast Ridge. At that point in the expedition, it was clear that Norman Dyhrenfurth, Jim Whittaker, and Gombu Sherpa would make the strongest team for that very important first attempt. Looking up the mountain, you could see what the normal route would be and what the British had done. When we got up there in the high camp, we crawled into the tents with the wind picking up and it was just a hell of a night. So at 4:00 in the morning, we stepped out into this howling storm. It was a ground blizzard, blowing stuff over. So you couldn't even see your feet. Just before that, someone had stopped, and "Come on, Gombu. You go," and, "You, Big Jim." And so we went side by side and, at 1:00 in the afternoon, May 1st, top of the world. (J. Krakauer) They became the 7th and 8th people, Big Jim and Gombu, In '63, to climb the Southeast Ridge. It was a formidable challenge and a great accomplishment. Now, most of the people are guided. Every inch of that route is prepared for them, fixed ropes, camps established. As in 2012, just getting up to the high camp is just lockstep, hundreds of climbers. Someone stops to adjust their goggles and the whole line has to stop. There's quite a few teams that are lined up to squeeze through this little break in the weather. (L. Whittaker) I imagine my dad with Gombu, climbing without fixed ropes. I always think about that when I'm holding onto those fixed ropes. It's a completely different game to be up there, unsupported, all alone. (D. Hahn) The mountain bears so little resemblance to the mountain climbed in 1963, that I'm straining at the link. You climbed the hell out of this mountain, Leif. (M. Arnot) That spot is a very special place. You look out and you can see the world all around you. As of right now, 2013, Everest has been climbed 6,200 times by all the different routes. Of these routes, 3,730 people have climbed Everest via the Southeast Ridge. 103 people have died attempting the Southeast Ridge. That's a ratio of 36 summits for every death. Now, you can pair that with the West Ridge of Everest. It's been climbed by exactly 14 people. 16 people have died either attempting to climb the West Ridge or while descending it. You have a greater chance of dying on the West Ridge than reaching the top. The regular route up Everest is super dangerous, but is nothing like the West Ridge. After Whittaker's success, there was no question that there was going to be a major push on the West Ridge and that there was going to be a traverse. And a traverse wasn't a good idea unless you were supported on the Southeast Ridge also. And so Bishop and Jerstad would be up there. (T. Hornbein) Lute and Barry had wanted to summit on the 18th of May. It seemed logical that their effort to go to the top would be timed with ours to support us in our fantasy of a traverse. But there were still plenty of stressful interactions. They reach this understanding, "We'll give you a couple more days. Lute and Barry will postpone their ascent. We'll have the porters hang around. But just climb the fucking mountain, will you?" May 16th, the clock is ticking, time is running short. And they were up at Camp 4 West, at the top of the West Shoulder. (J. Whittaker) Willi and I got back to camp and it was kind of windy. And we all had our dinner and climbed in. And this hurricane blew in overnight and crushed their tents. It looked bad. They were basically blown off the mountain. (J. Whittaker) You're like the boxer between rounds trying to catch a few breaths and before somebody comes and starts pounding on you again. (J. Krakauer) Having survived that, they just felt crushed, defeated. But Hornbein was like, "No. The clock is running out, but there's still a few seconds left for one final three-pointer from half court." "No, we're not going home yet." (J. Whittaker) My brain began to plot the possible way we might still be able to have another shot at it. (J. Norton) If we zoom in on the traverses out of the diagonal ditch... (D. Morton) It's all ice. (J. Norton) It's definitely looking to be fairly glazed, blue ice, like what we've seen so far. (D. Morton) It's hard to tell. This route is just totally changed from '63. (J. Norton) But I feel no less committed to the need to get up to the shoulder to see it for ourselves. We're all in total agreement that the story is still in trying. Nobody gets anywhere sitting in base camp and that's why we're going up. I'm feeling strong and healthy. It's always hard to motivate at 1:30 AM. (C. Mace) You feeling good about today? (D. Morton) Yeah. I'm good. (C. Mace) You look great {end-italic} . -(D. Morton) Thanks. Thanks. [wind blowing] [breathing heavily] (J. Norton) We got these terrible conditions up here, just rock-hard blue ice, covered by a little bit of snow. We're totally out of options and it's just not going to happen this year. I'm just happy that our trip may end on a beautiful day up at near 7,000 meters. (D. Morton) Since 1963, this mountain has changed so much. But if you get out anywhere else on this mountain, like the West Ridge, you're all alone and it's a completely wild experience. (D. Hahn) I think most climbers get into climbing because it's an adventure. It's not a guarantee of success. (J. Norton) We today have so many more advantages than the American Mount Everest expedition had in 1963. From gear to the knowledge of the route, of human physiology at high altitude, advanced oxygen systems, better technical climbing equipment, detailed forecasts that we can get over e-mail on a daily basis, we've got these huge advantages. But what is interesting is that, even on the Southeast Ridge and more so on the West Ridge, there's still no guarantee of success. (J. Whittaker) That windstorm had scoured the mountain and there was still snow, but there was stable snow. (T. Hornbein) We got up to this incipient ledge for a tent site. I slept better that night than any night on the trip up until then. there was nothing in me left to plot anymore. We were out of the tent by about 7 AM and it was still grey. Life was simple in those days, no harnesses. We were climbing a little bit on rock between snow. This is 1963, technical rock climbing at 28,000 feet. Nothing like that had been done anywhere. (T. Hornbein) That may be about the place where we radioed down to base camp. But then, no more word. All night, we were wondering, "What the hell?" We didn't know where they were. Neither of us had it in our heads that any... We weren't turning around. We traversed toward the West Ridge, not difficult, but very airy climbing, dropping off on both sides. A good 28,000 feet with another thousand to go, thinking to myself, "We're a long way from home." And then there was just a short distance up some snow. We'd been cruising along for so many hours that day with no end in sight and realized that we weren't going to be able to go any higher. Hit the top about 6:15, and saw Whittaker's flag half-shredded, and had our moments on the summit, maybe a few tears in reflections, but realizing that it was getting quite late. You could see the cramp-on holes that told us that Lute and Barry had been there. The plan on the 22nd was that the West Ridge guys would reach the summit, and meet Bishop and Jerstad there, and descend together. And Willi and Tom didn't get to the top until 6:15. And Lute and Barry got to the top at 3:15. (T. Hornbein) We came up on Bishop and Jerstad. And they were tuckered out. And I thought, "We've got to get these guys up and get us all moving down." So we must have gone another three hours. I'm guessing it was around midnight, had to stop and climb into our own thoughts for the night. And it was a big, lonely, empty, long night. They had to stop and spend the night out in the open. Climbers call that a bivouac, an unplanned night out. We were really alone up there. When they didn't show up is when I had a lot of dread that they were lost. So that was the beginning of the longest night of my life. 28,000 feet, highest bivouac in history, at the time and for many years thereafter. no oxygen, no tent, no sleeping bags, no water, no food. The temperature fell to 18 below zero. Three of the four, Barry, Lute, and Willi, got severe frostbite. If there had been a 10-mile-an-hour breeze, they would have frozen to death. And the sunrise came over Kanchenjunga and the whole world woke up. Came around a corner and here are Dingman and Germe Dorje coming up. I expected to find four dead people, if I found anybody, and here I found four friends still alive. What would have happened if they'd have died? How terrible. They were so lucky. And they knew that when they came off the mountain. The '63 Everest expedition is a bigger deal than when American landed on the moon. Even if you only have an inkling of what it was like in '63, you can't come away without tremendous respect for those who came before you. What Tom and Willi did can never be repeated in terms of sheer commitment, in my opinion. (Speaking German) I consider the 1963 traverse of Mount Everest as much more important than anything that came afterwards. And today it's still one of the most iconic climbs ever in the Himalaya. The unknown that those guys dealt with, and climbed through to do that, traversing the mountain, I mean, all those things... respect. And if one night, say they hadn't said, "So now we're going to put ourselves out there. Now we are giving everything, willing to risk our lives," then they wouldn't have set off. And this kind of commitment is needed by anyone who's choosing a new direction in any part of one's life. Let's have a little mystery. Let's have a little bit more challenge, an unknown outcome. Let's raise the bar. The real motivation is personal. It's getting to know yourself. It's going through the experience. It's going through hardship and seeing who you are when you come out on the other side. A basic ingredient of climbing or any adventure, is the amount of uncertainty as to whether you're going to succeed, as to the outcome. And the more uncertainty, then the more memorable the whole thing is going to be. [Breathing heavily] (T. Hornbein): Everything you do in life, risk is obviously part of the game and uncertainty is just an essential part of the seasoning of life.
