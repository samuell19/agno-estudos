Thoughts that have important consequences are always simple. All my thinking could be summed up with these words: Since corrupt people unite among themselves to constitute a force, honest people must do the same. It's as simple as that.

PETERSBURG. 1805 The celebrated Anna Pavlovna Scherer, most intimate lady-in-waiting of the Empress Maria Fedorovna, gave at her home the receptions which she alone had a gift for organizing. Tonight, Anna Pavlovna was "treating" her guests to a French aristocrat, the Vicomte de Mortemart, who'd taken refuge in Russia from the Antichrist Napoleon Buonaparte. The execution of Duke of Enghien was a state necessity. Napoleon is great, and the Revolution was a great thing... Excuse me, my dear Vicomte, but this unfortunate soiree at the Ambassador's deprives me of the pleasure to hear you out. It saddens me to have to leave this delightful party. Scherer's salon gathered together "the flower of the intellectual high society of St. Petersburg", as Anna Pavlovna herself described it. It was here, during these soirees, that could best be measured the political temperature of the official spheres in the capital which were close to the Court. My husband's planning to desert me, he may be killed. Tell me, why must we have this wretched war? Are you going off to the war, Prince? General Kutuzov has been kind enough to take me as aide-de-camp. - And what about Lisa, your wife? - She will go to the country. Oh, it's sinful of you to deprive us of your charming wife. Why can't men live without wars? Take us, women, we don't want anything. We don't need anything. What have you done to MIle Scherer? Now she's going to be really ill. This abbe is an interesting man, but he sees it in the wrong light. I think the eternal peace is possible, but, I don't know how to express it, only not through political balance. People should not say everywhere what they think. Have you made your mind at last? The Imperial Guards or diplomacy? I don't know yet. I don't like to be either. He must be a Freemason anyway. Let's talk about serious things. Have you been to the Cavalry? No. But that's what occurred to me, and I wanted to tell you about it. Now we're at war with Napoleon. If it were a liberation war, I would have understood. I would have been the first to enlist. But to help Britain and Austria to fight the greatest man in the world is not good. If everybody fought for their convictions, there would be no war. That would be wonderful! Perhaps, but that would never happen. Tell me, why are you going off to the war? Why? I don't know. I must go. Besides, I'm going... I'm going because I don't like the life I'm leading here. I have often wondered how is it Annette never got married. You're really stupid, all of you men, not to have married her. I'm sorry to say you don't understand anything about women. - You're such a debater, M. Pierre. - I'm arguing with your husband. I still can't understand why he wants to go off to war. When are you leaving? When I realized that I'll have to interrupt all those dear relations... And what's more, you know, Andrei... Why are you afraid, Lisa? I don't understand you. All men are egotists. Just for a whim, he's abandoning me, shutting me up in the country. With my sister and my father, remember. But without my friends, all alone! And I shouldn't be afraid? I still fail to understand why you're so afraid. Your doctor told you to go to bed earlier. It's time you were asleep. I don't mind talking in front of Monsieur Pierre. I've wanted to say this for months, Andrei. Why have you changed so much? What have I done to you? Why are you deserting me to go off to war? You've been treating me as though I were a child or an invalid. You weren't like this six months ago. I beg you to stop! Please, don't get upset, Princess. It's just your imagination, because, I assure you... I myself have felt that... I know... because... No, excuse me, an outsider has no business here. You mustn't get upset. - Good night. - Wait, Pierre. The princess is too kind not to let me enjoy your company. - There! He only thinks of himself! - Liz! Never marry, my friend, that is my advice to you. Never marry till you can say to yourself you've done everything, till you have stopped loving the woman whom you have chosen, till you're able to see her clearly. Otherwise you'll be making a cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing. Or everything that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. You say, Buonaparte and his career. But when he was working for his goal, he was free. He had nothing but his goal, and he had achieved it. And we have nothing but salons, gossip, balls, vanity, nonentity. The vicious circle I can't break free of. That's enough talk about me. Shall we talk about you? But what is there to say? Who am I after all? An illegitimate son, without name and without fortune. Of course, I have my freedom, and I'm enjoying it. Yet, I don't know what to take up, I need some advice from you. I'm very fond of you, because you're the only one who's really alive among our society. You can pick anything you like, the Imperial Guards, diplomacy. You're going to be all right everywhere. But you shouldn't associate with the Kuraghin set and their way of life. It doesn't suit you, the debauchery, the carousing. Do you know what? Seriously, I have long thought the same thing. Leading that sort of life, I can't decide anything properly. I waste money and get headaches. I won't go tonight. Give me your word that you won't be going there. I promise. Petrousha, dear friend, come over here! Get out, or they're going to think I'm holding on! You have a try, Hercules! Wait! Kuraghin! Listen! If anyone can do the same, I'll pay him 100 imperials. Do you understand? Attention! This is folly, gentlemen! He'll get himself killed. Don't startle him! Otherwise he's sure to be killed, and what then? The first who tries to come close to me is going to get pushed down. It's empty! Gentlemen! I will do the same thing! I will drink it up. Bring me a bottle of rum! I'll do it even without betting. Let him do it! You get dizzy just trying to get upstairs, man. Tell them to bring a bottle. I'll do it. Listen, I'll take your bet, but we'll do it tomorrow. And now we're going to pay a visit to the actresses! Let's go! And we'll take Bruin with us too! Prince Vassily is here. Count Bezukhov must be in a really bad state. I feel so sorry for poor Count Bezukhov. His health is so wretched already that the pranks of his son could very well be the death of him. What have they done now? The three of them dug up a bear somewhere and took him in a carriage to see the actresses. They captured a policeman, strapped him and the bear together and threw them into the Moika. The bear was swimming with the officer riding him. I can imagine, ma chere, what a look the officer had on his face! It's horrid! What's so funny about it, Count? Dolokhov has been reduced to the ranks, as for Anatole Kuraghin, his father had the affair hushed up, and Pierre Bezukhov has been exiled to Moscow. I hope no one in Moscow will receive him. I declined to do so, most emphatically. I have daughters. Still, you know, ma chere, it was a fine trick. Just think of the figure that police officer cut in the water! Monsieur Pierre. Here she is! My pet, whose name-day it is! You keep spoiling her, Ilya. How are you, my dear? Many happy returns! - A charming child. - Pure quick silver! Takes after me. Yes, they're wonderful kids. Sonya! What's the matter? What's wrong? - It's nothing. Leave me alone. - Nothing matters in this world. You alone are everything for me. I'll prove it to you. - I don't like it when you say so. - I won't. Forgive me, Sonya. It's so wonderful. Boris, come over here. I have to tell you something. Over here. I wonder what is this something. Kiss the doll. You don't want to? Come on, come here. Closer. More closer. Would you like to kiss me? Let me congratulate you on this occasion, my dear. And you, old sinner, feeling bored in Moscow? There's nothing much you can do. When your little birds grow up, you have to get them husbands. How are you, sweet little Cossack of mine? I know you're a rascal, but I love you just the same. Come here, my young friend. Here, I said. I used to tell your father the truth when he needed to be told. As for you, I feel it's my sacred duty to do the same. Some hero, isn't he? A pretty kettle of fish indeed! Your father lies on his death-bed and you amuse yourself. Tying a police officer to the back of a bear! Shame on you, dear! You'd do better to go to war. Well, now, I think, it's time for dinner. The manifesto on the declaration of war has already been out. I myself saw it in St. Petersburg. It's been delivered to the commander-in-chief in Moscow. Why in the devil should we go to war against Bonaparte? He has cut down Austria to size, it's going to be our turn next. It's for the reason, my dear sir, that the Emperor knows what to do. Well, Yeryoma, you'd be better off staying home, fixing your spinning wheels. This befits us better. We always have to fight to the last drop of our blood and die for our Emperor. And then everything will be all right. The less we debate this thing the better. That's what old Hussars think. And what do you think, young man and young Hussar? I agree with you absolutely. I'm convinced that Russians must either die or win. That's a real Hussar speaking, young man! What are you making such a row about there? Why are knocking on the table? Who are you angry with? As though you're confronting the French. I'm telling the truth. We're talking about the war. My son is going off. I have four sons in the army, and I don't worry. It's all in God's hands. One may die in one's bed, or God may save you on the battlefield. Yes, that's true. You know that I have sent for Pierre? The Count, by pointing at his portrait, demanded to see him. There's something I've kept praying for, my dear cousin, that God might be merciful to the Count, and might allow his noble soul to leave this earth in peace. Yes, of course. But the point is, as you know, that the Count has made out a will, leaving all of his property to Pierre. He's made out many other wills. He can't bequeath everything to Pierre. He's illegitimate. Can't you see the point, Katish? You're an intelligent woman! Can't you see that if the Count wrote to the Czar begging him to legitimize his son, that means that Pierre will become Count Bezukhov. And according to the will, he'll get everything. Mama told me to ask you to dance. I'm afraid of getting the steps all mixed up. However, if you don't mind being my teacher... Semyon! The Daniel Cooper! You know it? Look at Papa! Look at Papa! Look at the Master. He's a real eagle, isn't he? Pray to our Lord! O Lord, have mercy! O Lord Almighty, the Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ, stretch forth Thy all-honorable hand on Your servant Kirill. We pray Thee and implore Thee, absolve Thou the soul of Thy servant Kirill from every bond. Pardon his transgressions, both of knowledge and of ignorance. And unto Thee do we ascribe glory now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen! O Lord, have mercy! O Lord, have mercy! If the Count didn't ask for me, I'd better go home. My friend, I'm suffering as much as you are, but try to be a man. Man's earthly life has limits and these limits cannot be exceeded. There's never been a case that one has lived after the 3rd stroke. What an iron constitution he had! Who's going to inherit all this? It will not go begging. Have courage. He has summoned you here and that's good. Some water? Pierre? Would you like us to call Prince Vassily? The master wants to be moved over on his side. For I am in trouble, and receive Thou my soul and deliver it. Ye who are my kinfolk in the flesh, and ye who are my brethren in the spirit, my friends and wonted acquaintances, weep ye, sigh, wail; for Io, now I am departing from you. Let go, I tell you! I'll take the responsibility. You don't know what you're doing. - You vile woman. - Let go! What are you doing? He's about to die and you leave me here alone! Yes, you've been waiting for that. You may rejoice now. Ah, my friend. We sin, we cheat. And what is the point? I'm already in my 50s, my friend... We'll all die. Death is horrible. He is no more. Come on, I'll see you out. Try to cry. Nothing gives better relief than tears. God will be with you. You are young and now, I hope, you've come into possession of a big fortune. Ever since Czar Paul I has exiled him to his estate, the General-in-Chief, Prince Nikolai Andreyevich Bolkonsky, nicknamed in high society "The King of Prussia", had never left his estate property "Bald Hills" where he dwelt with his daughter, Princess Maria. Are you well? Sit down. For tomorrow... Wait, there's a letter for you. - From Eloise? - Yes, it's from Julie. I'm going to let you have two more letters, the third one I'll read. I'm afraid, you're writing a lot of nonsense. - You may read this, Father. - I said, the third! Well, young lady... These triangles are similar. As you can see, the sides A, B and C of a triangle... The strict order of life at Bald Hills could not be broken even by such an event as saying goodbye to his son. It's so much like him... What an intelligent man is your father. Perhaps, that's the reason I'm so afraid of him. Please, sit down. Be seated, Mikhail Ivanovich. You should walk as much as possible. Against your will, He will save you and have mercy and will turn you to Himself, because only in Him you'll find truth and comfort. Please, take it, Andrei, for my sake. - You're going? - I came to say goodbye. Kiss me. Thank you. Why do you thank me? Because you're not wasting time, hanging on to the woman's skirt. Service before everything. Thank you very much. If you have anything to say, speak. I can do two things at one time. It's my wife. I'm sorry to leave her on your hands. Nonsense. Tell me what you want. When it's time for her to deliver, could you send for an obstetrician? I know nothing can be done if Nature doesn't condescend to yield. I agree that out of a million cases only one goes amiss. But she's worried and it so happens I am too. She's heard stories, had nightmares and she's afraid. I'll do it. It's bad, isn't it? - What is bad, father? - The wife! I don't understand you. There's nothing you can do, my friend. They're all like that. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. And you know it yourself. But you can't help it. She's beautiful! I'll do everything. Don't worry. Give this letter to Mikhail Illarionovich. I'm asking him not to use you as aide-de-camp for too long. It's very ugly work! You'll tell him he enjoys my admiration and affection. Write me how he's welcomed you. Stay with him if he's worthy. Nikolai Andreyevich Bolkonsky's son doesn't need any favors. Now come here. My time will come before yours does. Here are some notes I've written. Make sure the Czar gets them. Here's a letter of credit and one for the Academy. The prize will go to the man who is to write the story of Suvorov's campaigns. Here are a few personal jottings. Read them when I'm gone. You'll find them worth your while. I'll carry out all your instructions, Father. And now goodbye! But remember, Prince Andrei, should you die on the battlefield, your old father will mourn for you. But should I hear you've behaved not like Nikolai Bolkonsky's son, I will be ashamed! You need not have said that to me, Father. There's something else I wanted to ask you. If I am killed and if I have a son, would you keep him here with you? Let him grow up under your roof. Please. Not to give him to your wife? We've already said goodbye. You may go. Go! Under the command of Kutuzov, the Russian army, 50,000 strong, marched into Austria to join forces with the allied army of the Austrian General Mack, to undertake joint action against Napoleon. They say Kutuzov is one-eyed. Sure thing! Absolutely one-eyed! No, pal, he sees better'n you do. Checked everything: Boots, puttees. When he looked at my feet, I thought I'm done... I wish we had a rest 'fore marching another 5 versts without a bite... Germans provided carriages. We used to ride like some big shots. Poles, they also of the Russian crown. Now there're only Germans. Singers, up front! Hey, you senny, Russian senny, new-made entrance to my home, Brand-new senny, all of maple and of lattice handiwork. Through these senny I will pass Arm-in-arm with my sweet lass. Here comes a fair maid outside the new-made gate, Brand-new gate of pure oak and of lattice handiwork. She would let a falcon out, of her right sleeve he'll flutter out. Fly on, falcon, high and far! Go on flying high and far, Very high and very far to my dear home town, To my dear home town! Good morning! Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians! Hurrah for the whole world! Well, what is it, Prince? We've got orders to write a paper explaining why we're not advancing. And why aren't we? No news from Mack? If Mack's been defeated and the allied forces destroyed, we would have known about it. Perhaps. I'd like to see Commander-in-Chief Kutuzov. The Commander-in-Chief is engaged. Whom shall I announce? General Kutuzov is busy! You see before you the unfortunate General Mack. - Why do you look so gloomy? - There's nothing to rejoice about. Step back. Make way. My congratulations! General Mack is here. He is in good health, but a little bit knocked down up there. Sir, if you prefer to be a clown, I cannot do anything to stop you. But I'm warning you that if you dare buffooning in my presence again I'll have to teach you good manners! - I only congratulated. - I'm notjoking! Come on, dear, what is it with you? Can't you see? We're either officers serving our Czar and Fatherland, rejoicing over our common success or mourning our common failure, or we're lackeys who don't give a damn about the master's affairs. Forty thousand people have died, our ally's army has been destroyed, and you are able to joke about it. Only silly kids can amuse themselves in this way. Isn't it charming how the Gascons show what they're made of? Well? Three of them go and seize a bridge. The French cross the bridge and their army gets across the Danube. But if the French have crossed the Thabor Bridge, that means Kutuzov's army is cut off, it is doomed! That's what it looks like. Wait, I have some plans for you for this evening. She is delightful, isn't she? Happy is the man who will possess her. With her, the most unworldly husband would automatically take a prominent position in society, don't you think so? - I wanted to know your opinion. - Yes, yes, she's beautiful. Well, goodbye, Prince. And God protect you. May your great endeavor succeed. You have my blessing. Get in with me. Permit me to stay in General Bagration's detachment. Get in. I also need good officers on my staff. I also need them. There's still much to be done. Much to be gone through. Should just one tenth of Bagration's soldiers return tomorrow, I'll be grateful to Almighty God. That's why I'd like to be assigned to this detachment. With 4,000 exhausted men, Bagration had been entrusted to delay the entire enemy army for twenty-four hours. This respite was indispensable to Kutuzov in order for him to get his transport-burdened army out of reach of the French troops, outnumbering his own three to one. Gentlemen, what does this mean? You can't leave your posts! Take you, Captain. You should be ashamed of yourself, Captain Tushin. An officer should set a good example, and where're your boots? If the alarm were sounded, you'd be in your stocking feet! Wouldn't that be a pretty sight? So return to your posts, gentlemen. The soldiers say you go faster without boots on. Will you return to your posts? It was getting closer and closer, that special moment, for which so much work had been done and so much hardship endured, for which soldiers had been drilled for fifteen years, homes and families left, and a peasant turned into a warrior, for which 80,000 men lived in the field, without wives and children, without participation in the affairs of civil life, moving through a strange, unknown country. They lived in the fields, on the roads, in the woods, neglecting all the amenities of a habitual human life. For all those men, a road was not the way to their family, pleasures or work, but a way of bypassing or attacking, a house was not the hearth and home, but the ambush position, people were not their brothers, but the tools and the necessary victims of death. No, my friend, if a man could know what would be after his death, none of us would fear death. That's how it is, my friend. Fear it or not, you won't escape it. But you fear it anyway... There, you smart people. You artillerymen are so smart because you can take everything with you, both vodka and snacks. And still you fear. Uncertainty, that's what one fears most. Though they say that your soul will go to Heaven... We know there's no Heaven, it's all just the atmosphere. Come on, give us a taste of your herbal vodka, Tushin. With my pleasure. And yet, to fathom your future life... It has begun! Here it is! It has begun! The battle! It's terrible, but glorious! It has begun! That's it! It has begun! That's it! Two points up should do it. Load, Medvedev! Schoengraben is burning! Please, Your Highness, come away from here. Please, Your Highness! For God's sake! Can't you see what's happening? The French! Fine looking soldiers. Left, left... Left, left... Left, left... Left, left... Close in! Battalion, halt! Down knapsacks! God be with us! What is it? I don't move, I fell, I'm killed. There are people coming. They will help me. Who are these people? They can't be the French. O God, You who's in this sky, forgive, save and protect me. Are they coming to me? Why? To kill me? Yes, they may kill me. Me, who is loved by everyone? It's impossible that they would want to kill me! Captain Tushin's battery had been forgotten. The troops assigned to cover it had withdrawn. The enemy could not conceive that anyone would be so foolhardy as to go on fighting with four unprotected guns. On the contrary, the French supposed that it was here, in the center, that the main Russian forces were concentrated. - Gentlemen, everyone fall back. - Fall back everyone! - What shall we fire, Captain? - Nothing. A shell! Fire! All right, my little old lady, don't let me down! What do you know! Firing again. Captain Tushin! Captain! Have you gone mad? Haven't you been ordered twice to fall back? I just... I... Fall back! Everybody fall back! Your Excellency! Here are two trophies. I've captured a French officer, the whole company's a witness! Very well. Remember, Your Excellency, I'm Dolokhov, reduced in rank! I received a bayonet wound! Stayed right up at the front! Remember, Your Excellency! Captain Tushin, you've been ordered to fall back. Well, goodbye. Goodbye, my friend. Goodbye, dear man. Captain, for God's sake, I've been contused in the arm. For God's sake, I can't walk. Give orders to put me on the cart. Put him on. Spread the coat, man. Get on. The thirty-five thousand men of Kutuzov's army were saved. The next day the French army did not renew its assault and what was left of Bagration's detachmentjoined Kutuzov's army. - Does it hurt? - Cut it out, for Christ's sake. That's a lot of cripples for one day's action. Captain, you're wanted by the general. He's in that house. I thank you all, gentlemen. How did it happen that the gun was abandoned? I don't know, Your Excellency. I had no men, Your Excellency. You might have picked some up in the column that was covering you. Tushin did not say that he had no covering troops, although this was the absolute truth. He was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble. Your Excellency! You sent me to Captain Tushin's battery today. I found two thirds of his men and his horses knocked out, two of his guns disabled, and no covering troops at all. And if Your Excellency will permit me to give my opinion, we owe today's success mainly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of Captain Tushin and his company. Captain Tushin, you can go. Thank you very much, my friend. You really saved me. Thanks very much. Yesterday at the meeting of the Imperial Council, our new governor-general, Sergei Kuzmich, was reading the Czar's rescript from the army. The rescript starts with the words: "Sergei Kuzmich, I have been hearing rumors on all sides..." Poor Count, he managed to get as far, that's all. He never got any further than "Sergei Kuzmich"? No, not one iota further. "Sergei Kuzmich"... On all sides, "Sergei Kuzmich"... Everything is going well. He would try again several times, but as soon as he said "Sergei", he would choke, at "Kuzmich", he would sob, and "on all sides" would be drowned in tears. Then he'd start again... It's time I understood her, and made up my mind what she really is. Was I mistaken before? Or am I mistaken now? No, she's not stupid. She's beautiful. Are you pleased with this evening? This celebration of my name-day was one of the most pleasant. It's quite late, I... Well, Helen? "Sergei Kuzmich on all sides..." Of course, it's a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear... Marriages are made in heaven. "Sergei Kuzmich..." What's the point of that story? I don't think I got it. I didn't either. Aline, why don't you go and see what they're doing. Still the same. Heaven be praised. My wife has told me everything. Helen, my dear! I'm so happy. I loved your father so much. You couldn't get a better wife. God bless you, my children! Princess, come here, quickly! My child, God bless you. Helen. Oh, take those off... Those... Now it's too late. It's done. But I do love her. The battle of Austerlitz was called at the time "The battle of the three Emperors". The Emperors of Russia and Austria were inspecting the allied armies. What are we to do if Napoleon takes the offensive? It is unlikely. Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow, or rather today, for now it is after midnight, simply can't be changed. You know them, and we shall do our duty. And before the battle, the most important thing is a good sleep. Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow. I have a feeling that tomorrow for the first time I shall have a chance to show all I can do. Mikhail Illarionovich, what do you think of tomorrow's battle? I think that the battle will be lost. I said so to Count Tolstoy, and I asked him to tell the Czar. I want glory. I want to be known to men, to be loved by people. It's not my fault I want that and live only for that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone about that. But what am I to do? Death, wounds, the loss of my family, nothing frightens me. I'd give everything for a moment of glory, for an instant of triumph, for the love of men I don't even know. And what if there were nothing left but to die? Well, if I had to, I should do that as well as anyone. Your Excellency, your orders have been executed. What are they doing? Good morning, Your Excellency! Attention! Why don't you begin, Mikhail Illarionovich? I'm waiting, Sire. Not all the columns have had time to form up. We're not at a parade, Mikhail Illarionovich, where they don't begin until everyone's there. That is exactly why I wait, Sire, because it's not a parade and we're not at Tsaritsyn Field. However, if such is your command, Your Majesty... At five o'clock that afternoon, the battle was irretrievably lost on all fronts. - The enemy's there. - No! Look! That's it, men! Hold it! Where are you going? Are you wounded? My real wound is over there. Stop them! Oh, Bolkonsky, what's going on? Forward, boys! How quiet it is. How peaceful and yet how majestic. It's so different from all the charging and shouting we made. How is it that I'd never noticed this boundless sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes, all is vanity and deception, except that boundless sky. There is nothing, nothing, except that. But perhaps even this sky does not exist, perhaps there is nothing at all but stillness and peace. God be praised! That's a beautiful death. End of Part One PART TWO Denissov! We're home! Nicky! Nicky! Candles! Tea! I didn't expect! Nicky, my dear! What about me? Vassily Denissov. Your son's friend. Welcome! I know, Nicky wrote about you. Natasha, Vera, here's Denissov. We are happy to meet you. Oh, how good it is. Splendid! Princess Maria! Andrei? I've just got news. He's not a prisoner, nor is his body found. Kutuzov writes me... he was killed. Father, don't turn away. Let's weep together. The scoundrels! The murderers! They destroy the army, the people. What for? Go and tell Lisa. Father, tell me how it happened. Go on. Killed on the battlefield where the best Russian men and Russian glory were led to their death. Go on, Princess Maria! Go and tell Lisa. I'll be right with you. Marie, let me have your hand. There... Do you feel it? It feels so strange. And you know, Marie, I'm going to love him so much. What's the matter, Marie? Nothing. I just feel sad. Feel sad about Andrei. Have you got any news from him? No. You know it's too early to get any news. But Father is worried, and I'm scared. So, nothing? Nothing. Mitya, ride to our country estate and tell Maxim the gardener to pay his due to the landowner. By Friday I'll need here two hundred pots. Besides, we'll need singers, strawberries and pineapples. Don't worry, Count, now that young Bezukhov is here, we can get everything from his hothouses. Yes, you tell Bezukhov to come too. I'll include him in the list. - Is he here with his wife? - My friend, he is so unhappy. That young Bezukhov is such a heavenly, sublime soul. I'll try to cheer him up. What happened anyway? Dolokhov, Maria Ivanovna's son, has compromised her reputation. Pierre introduced him to society, invited to his St. Petersburg home... Now she came to Moscow and this dare-devil followed her. They say Pierre is absolutely heart-broken. Tell him to come to the club anyway. He will forget about everything. We'll have quite a party! What's the matter with you? Don't you hear it? To the health of our Emperor! I hadn't recognized you. Wouldn't you like to renew old acquaintances? Forget him. He's a fool. To the health of the hero of our last campaign, His Highness Pyotr Ivanovich Bagration! Crowned with laurels and with glory For your famous, heroic deeds, Russia's pride that's great in story, Fate has brought you in our midst! After battle find your peace In your fellow citizens' circle. We have heard many a time Of your feats, gallant and bold. It's a pleasure as sublime For all Moscow you to behold. After battle find your peace In your fellow citizens' circle. And now let's drink to the health of beautiful women! You can't see too well through your glasses. Your wife's liaison with Dolokhov is a secret to no one but yourself. You can't see too well through your glasses. Your wife's liaison with Dolokhov is a secret to no one but yourself. To beautiful women, Petrousha, and to their lovers. You can't see too well through your glasses. Your wife's liaison with Dolokhov is a secret to no one but yourself. Don't you dare take it! No, I will keep it! You... You are a scoundrel! You will give me satisfaction! Maybe I'd have done the same thing in Dolokhov's place. It's even certain that I'd have done the same. Then why this duel? This murder? I should go away, run, hide somewhere! At this moment, a very solemn one for you, Count, I wouldn't be doing my duty if I didn't speak frankly. In my opinion, there're not sufficient grounds for this duel, the matter's not worth blood being shed over. You weren't quite in the right, Count, you lost your temper. Yes, that was stupid. Then please allow me to convey your regrets, and I'm convinced our opponents will accept your apologies. - Let me negotiate with them. - There's no point in that. It makes no difference. Well, are we ready? - But perhaps we could... - Absolutely no apologies! You just tell me which way should I walk and where should I fire? What? Yes, that's the way it's done. I know, I've just forgotten. - Shall we begin? - I suppose so. Since there can be no reconciliation, we may begin. When I count three, start advancing towards each other. One, two... Three! No, no! It's not over! Get back to the barrier! Cover yourself! I missed! I missed... It's so stupid, stupid... Death. Death. Lies! So stupid. Death and lies... Well? How are you? I'm all right. But I've killed her. I've killed her... She won't get through this. Who? My mother. My mother. My angel, my adorable angel. My mother. Rostov was greatly surprised to learn that Dolokhov, that brawler and duellist, lived in Moscow with his old mother and hunchbacked sister and was a most loving son and brother. Now what's all this? What have you done, I'm asking you? Me? Why? I... You've decided to be a hero! What's the meaning of this duel? What were you trying to prove? So, you won't answer? Then I'm going to tell you. You believe everything anybody says. You were told that Dolokhov was my lover, and you believed it. What did you prove by doing this? What could you prove with this duel? That you are a fool? But everyone already knew that. Now all this'll end up in my being the laughing stock of Moscow. And everyone will be able to say that you had drunk so much that you challenged a man of whom you were jealous for no reason and who, in every way, is a better man than you are. What ever made you think that he was my lover? Because I've enjoyed his company? If you hadn't been so dull I might have enjoyed yours more. Will you stop speaking? Please. Why should I stop speaking? I'm going to say outright that there isn't another woman who married to such a husband wouldn't have taken several lovers. And I've never had any. I think we had better separate. Separate? Only on the condition that you give me a fortune. Separate! Don't you think you can frighten me! I'm going to kill you! Get out! Tikhon! Go upstairs to Maria Bogdanovna and just say to her: "The Prince has sent me to ask how she is?" Then come back and tell me what she says. You can tell His Highness that labor has started. According to a popular belief, the fewer people know about the suffering of a woman in labor the less is her suffering. Everyone pretended to be unaware of it. Nobody spoke about it, but everyone in the house wore a common stamp of worry, of soft-heartedness and of knowing that something momentous and incomprehensible was happening at that time. If God is merciful, no doctor would be needed. Princess, someone is coming. Up the driveway, with lanterns lighted. Must be the doctor. Thank God! I'll go out to meet him. He doesn't speak Russian. - Is the Princess well? - Very well. No, it can't be! It would be so incredible! There is a kind fate! Masha, my dear! Oh, darling... God is merciful. She was not surprised at seeing him there. She didn't understand that he had returned. His coming had nothing to do with her agony, nor with its relief. No, you're not allowed in. Why have they taken a baby in there? Why a baby? Has a baby been born? I loved you all. I did no harm to anyone. And now what have you done to me? What have you done? Oh, what have you done to me? And why? I can't begin to tell you what I've been through since then. Yes, we have all changed a great deal. - What are your plans? - My plans? What can I say? But why aren't you serving in the army? After Austerlitz? No, thank you very much. If Bonaparte were here, near Smolensk, I wouldn't serve in our army even then. - Did you hear about the duel? - You had to go through that too. The one thing I thank God for is he wasn't killed. Why? Killing a mad dog is a good thing. It's evil to kill a man. It's wrong. But why is it wrong? It's not up to men to judge what is right and what is wrong. Men will always be wrong, and never so wrong as when they decide what's right and wrong. Anything that does harm to another man is wrong. How can you be sure what will do harm to another man? Personally, I know of only two real evils in life: Remorse and sickness. And happiness is the absence of those two evils. To live for one's self in such a way as to avoid these two evils is my whole philosophy now. But how can anyone live for himself alone? No, no, I couldn't live like that. I'm feeling deep in my heart that I'm part of this vast, harmonious whole. I feel that not only I cannot disappear, as nothing disappears in this world, but I have been and will be forever. This is Herder's philosophy. But it's not going to convince me. Life and death are the only convincing things. I'm only convinced when I've seen someone who's dear to me, who's close to me, toward whom I behaved wrongly and still hoped to make it right, all of a sudden suffering terrible pain and breathing her last. What on earth for? There must be some answer! Of course... I mean it's not argument that convinces me, it's setting out in life with someone you love and suddenly that someone disappears... into nothingness. You stop before that abyss and have a look down there. Just as I have done. Of course. Isn't that exactly what I've been saying? We must live. We must love. We must believe that we're not only living now on this lump of earth, but that we have lived and shall live forever, in everything. Your Highness, isn't it good? - What? - Isn't it good, Your Highness? What is he talking about? Yes, the spring, I suppose. It's true, everything is green already. So soon. The birch, the bird-cherry... And the alder is opening up. Only the oak shows no signs of life. Yes, there's the oak. Spring... Love... Happiness... Haven't you grown weary of this same stupid, meaningless delusion? It's always the same, and it's always a lie. There is no spring, no sun, and no happiness. I don't believe in your hopes and in your illusions. Yes, the oak is right, a thousand times right. Let the others, the young, to be taken in by this delusion. We who know life know that it is finished. Yet we must live out our lives, doing no harm, and not worrying or desiring anything. His obligations as trustee of the family's Ryazan estate compelled Prince Andrei to call upon the local Marshal of Nobility, Count Rostov. - Just once more! - But when are you coming to bed? I can't sleep anyway. What can I do? Oh, isn't it lovely? Now let's go to bed! You go. I can't. Sonya, how can you sleep? Just look how lovely it is. Oh, wake up, Sonya! There's never been such a beautiful night. Will you look at that moonlight? Oh, it's marvelous! Come and look, please, my dear. You see? It makes me want to sit down on my heels, like this, put my arms around my knees... and hug them tight, as tight as I can, and then I'd fly up. Like this! Yes, it was here, in this forest, that I saw that oak, with which we agreed. But where is it? Yes, it's the same oak! I loved you all. I've done no harm to anyone. And now what have you done to me? We must live. We must love. We must believe that we're not only living now on this lump of earth, but that we have lived and shall live forever, in everything. No, life is not over at thirty-one. It's not enough for me to know what I have in me. Everyone else must know it too: Pierre and that little girl who wanted to fly away. Everyone must know me so that my life won't be spent for myself alone. My life must be reflected in theirs, and all the others must live my life with me! End of Film One
