Who's there? Who's, who...? Come on, come on, who's there? This is state land. You're trespassing. I have the distinct privilege and the high personal honor of presenting to you, The president of the United States. The second time around it sounds nice. There's a-uh, messed up elk out there on the old state road. Messed up? Mangled. Not by any animals either. I've been so worried. Especially with that, that Randall Tucker mess. Oh the hell with that Randall Tucker. What's for supper? You ever hear of a Jeb Tucker? Louise DuBoise said something about a Jeb Tucker getting into her things. You don't think that, umm, Randall and Liza... - What? - Are starting a brood? Ohh. Oh. Well God help us if they did. William Oswald the third, did you just use the lords name? I did. Well, shame on you. Jesus Fucking Christ. There's someone out there. Ah! Ahh! Oh-ho-ho. Haha! Did you recognize him? - That boy? - Yeah. Hit high and low with an ugly stick. I've seen better east ends of a horse headed west. Damn that Randall Tucker. Now William, you radio that Sheriff right now. You hear me? Yeah, yeah, alright. Oh! - Aghh. - Ahh-ahhhh-ahhhhhh! Ugh! Oh! Ughh! Oh! Ahh-ha! Ahh-ha-ha. Ohhh! There you are. What's up? Is that Buck? Yeah, he ain't good. Oh my God. Buck? Hey Kathy. Haven't seen you in since... Gosh, It's been a month of Sundays. You were in our prayers. Ready for that cherry pie? Made fresh. Yeah, ok. Hey Mister, are you Buck Severs? - Yes, I am. - Can I have your autograph? Sure thing, buddy. What's your name? Zack. I knew it was you. Man, I loved it when you body slammed the warrior in the steel cage match at Mania twenty seven and when you fought Buffalo Bob and roped him with his own lasso. Here you are Buck. Miss, you know this is? I think I have a pretty good idea. - There you go buddy. - When are you coming back? Soon. I have to get all better first. I can't wait. Me too. Ugh! Trent? Pack your bags, the trip's on. What trip? Don't tell me you forgot the return of bro's weekend? No, I didn't forget. Listen, be at Henderson Airport, Friday, 7:00 A.M. Sharp. First class? Better than first class. Where? Doing camping hiking in the ass end of Pennsylvania. You mean, Detroit's all booked up? That's Morgan's thing. Says we won't regret it. I can't believe you forgot bro's weekend. - Sorry. - Just be at the airport. Are you alright, Mr. Severs? Hey, hey, hey, hey, Buck. Long time, no see man! Yeahhh. How long's it been? It's gotta be at least three years, right? Three yea-Jesus. Three years. Sh... Well, you look good, you do. Sorry, uh, uh, about all the... Thanks. So, uh, how's Allison? Allison, that was like two wives ago. - Sorry. - Ah, whatever. They know what they're getting into. They know who I am. We get down and dirty with some funky and nasty shit. That's TMI dude. TMI. And you tie the knot, all of a sudden, get all clingy and needy. Like they got exclusive rights to me. You know, in a legally binding sense. So what, I bring a little Chlamydia back from Thailand.

So, I did some research on this game preserve. There's not much out there about this Foggy Creek. It's more of an urban myth. If you didn't know any better. What the fuck are you talking about? We're going to a game preserve. Seriously Trent. You told me we were going hiking and camping. Hunting too, if you want. Or, or not if you don't. It's Morgan's thing. Come on, it will be good for ya'. Eye of the tiger. Don't start with that eye of the tiger bullshit. - Did you find out where it is. - Negatory. Ohhh! Seriously guys? We don't even know where the fuck we are going? We'll find it. We'll just ask the locals. We're doing them a service. Lack of predators. The deer become overpopulated. The circle of life, Buck. Things die. Sorry, man. What, you're not gonna talk to me now? God damnit Buck. It's not your fault, okay? What happened to Cindy and Roxanne was bad fucking luck. What happened in the ring, bad fucking luck. And I'm worried about you. Bottom line, you should have told me. Honestly fellas, I don't feel like being around anybody killing anything right now. You're right. You want me to take you back? I don't know, maybe. Come on, Buck. I haven't seen you since the hospital. Three years. We'll hang tonight, roast marshmallows. Drink a few beers. Fine.

I'm the only one out here with any real survival instincts. Since when? See that? When I was a boy, I had this German shepherd. Beautiful dog. Named him Byron. That's a good German name. I really did. You remember my dad. Oh, yeah. So he starves Byron for like, five days. Then he takes me out to the barn. Byron's there, chained to the post. Rip me to shreds. I'm sitting there and I'm crying my eyes out and my father smacks me and says, "Let's see who" the master is". He hands me a knife and he sets Byron Free. Byron knocks me on my ass. I'm kicking and screaming and he's trying to rip my throat out and, and suddenly, I snapped. All of a sudden, it, it all made sense. So I took that knife and I cut Byron open. Throat to tail. No offense but your dad was an asshole. My dad was a genius. That night taught me to take charge. I've gotten anything I've ever set my mind to. I got a whole new project I'm working on. Ooh-hoo-hoo. Something special. Yeah, what's that? Ooh. In due time. Oh dear God! Oh God damn it Buck. Are you trying to give me a heart attack? No comment. Yeah, okay, I deserve that. Buck, you have no idea.
