THE BEAUTIFUL MILLER'S WIFE At the end of 1600, in the kingdom of Naples, under Spanish rule. The sun shines peacefully, the cicadas sing, the chickens lay eggs every day, and the fields give abundant wheat. An ideal country, indeed, truly a beautiful dream. If... Oh, Holy Virgin! - Don't cry, Ros?, St Gennaro wills it. To pay for their sins! What did he do? - Eh? He didn't pay the rain tax. But this year there's been no rain! - Taxes are always due. - Jesus! Good morning. In the name of the viceroy of Spain. The "Droit de seigneur" is abolished and replaced with a tax of two carlinis... What does it say? - Wait. per month for the right to lie with one's own wife. This tax is due... - What? even if one does not lie with his own wife. - Another tax? What's this news? - Governor's order. It wasn't there this morning! - Now it is. Pay! How much? - One carlino. Here! May the Governor get what I wish him! Which is? Roses and flowers, Excellency. Roses and flowers! One carlino for the toll, one for transportation, two for the wife, two for the rain... Instead of wheat, we're planting taxes! You're telling me? Stop! Stop! Hey, you! - What? - Can't you read? A little, but that I understand. Less talk, get in the line. One moment, one moment. So, let's see... Green for the tolls. For you! Can you read? "By our order, it is granted to the miller Luca..." Oh! You're Luca the miller? - Yeah, so it seems. Well, so sorry. - Thank you! Enjoy your ride! - You too! Passage prohibited Watering forbidden Hi, Luca! - Giov?, how's things? Don't ask! Lucky mules, get to drink wherever they want! Eh, my dear, you have to make do! - It's not easy. My advice is to pay. The Baron must be paid. Wait, wait a moment. - But, how? Who's there? Who is it? Excellency! Who is it? Who? Oh, Luca, how goes it? Sir, forgive me if I disturbed you, but my mules were thirsty. - No problem! And how is your wife? - Quite fine! Carmela, wake up! - Oh, there she is! - It's the lawyer. - I didn't see her. Good morning, Excellency, how are you? - Fine, thank you. - You too. Will you come to the mill today? - Oh God, if you really want... The governor has sent a kid as big as a calf and tender like a lark. I just need the greens from your garden. They will be there too! Chicory and tomatoes! As sweet as sugar. Just what your wine needs! Oh, what am I saying? - Why? Because the lawyer's wine is finished, gone. What? No more wine? Do you water your vineyards with it? How is that? A barrel so big? Well, too bad! You can drink our wine. - What? Our poor wine for his Excellency? No, no! We won't allow that! - Actually... - No, no! Excellency, we won't allow it! - Uh, no... Moreover, you've been kind once, but now... What kind of invitation it'd be if you always bring us stuff? - Well... Then... - No, no! If you say "then"... His Excellency feels bad, Carmela. We must accept. - Let's accept it then! - OK, Sir! You can refuse once, but next time it becomes rude. Thank his Excellency! Thanks, Excellency, thanks so much! - Nothing, nothing... - Oh, Excellency! Next time, in order to save trips, the cask, rather than like this, send it big like that! - Alright... - Goodbye! See you at the mill! Sir, what are we doing here? Just a moment, I'm coming. Carm?! - What? The lawyer is in love with you! - You don't say! Everyone is in love with me. - Boom! Yeah, boom! Everyone, except one. Who's this idiot? You! - Me? Well, you guessed it, Carm?! - Why? Because you're so ugly! Salvatore! - What? - Luca's coming with his shameless wife! Just watch! Today, I'll count his sacks. In the name of the king, stop! - Hey, want to be run over? When I say "In the name of the king", you have to stop, got it? Stop I said! OK, I'm stopping. What news is this? I always pass. Not today. Today I count the sacks. Any objection? Why waste time? I'll tell you myself: they're 20. And for 20, I got an exemption. Here it is. Well, if they're 20, you've nothing to fear, right? Now we'll see. What do you want to happen? Don't worry! Yeah! The lady doesn't worry! She knows how to fix it. A word to the governor, and... - What do you mean? Keep quiet, Carm?! I'll deal with it. Salvatore! No use counting. There's a few sacks over. Turn a blind eye. Let's help each other. - I got nothing to do with you! Pull down the sacks! I'll seize them, and I'll report you too! He says they're 20! - Alright! - We're going to laugh now. 20...! And then, who says they're all flour? I'll check. - Check what, you jerk? Salvat?, but are you Italian or Spaniard? - I am... Spaniard, French, I'm from the country of whoever's in charge! - You have... You have the greed of servility! I have the greed to see you in jail! Hopefully, heaven gives us this grace! Your cousin must choke before getting that post as tax collector! Oh, so that's why! - Yes, that's why! You want to give our job to your wife's relatives! My cousin is a fine man! - Carm?, keep calm. Let me explain. - Explain what? You should be ashamed for what you do! This time you won't win not even with your vixenish flirting! Better a coquette than an owl like you! You're angry 'cause you're ugly! Better ugly to one than nice to fifty! - Harpy! Trollop! - To whom? Have you two gone mad? - Let go of me! Damn you! - Go to hell, ugly witch! Take this! Salvat?, damn, help me! Don't you see those? - Shameless! What's going on? - Do you see this? Help! Hold them! Salvat?, what are you doing? - Here, take this! Outrage and assault! Assunta! Stop it! - Stop now! I'll fix this guy for good! Stop it! Outrage and assault! You'll end up in jail! Now calm down, be quiet! OK, I'm calm. Are you alright? Where are you going? - Let go! You slut! If you weren't a woman, Carmela... Come here, you old witch! The bishop! The bishop! There's the bishop! Leave her alone, there's the bishop! You know nothing, OK? I'll do the talking. Clean yourself! Peace be with you. Luca, is that you? And you too, Carmela? What happened? Eminence, she insulted me. Who insulted you? What nerve! Let others speak too. Everyone has a right to defend himself. You speak, Luca. This woman made such low insinuations on my wife's honor. and on who governs us, by the Lord's grace! - But we... Enough, enough! Aestimat esse caprae vitium quodsi capere in se. His Excellency thinks it's the vice of a goat. But there's no goat here! But I translated the Latin text. - The goat... here, stands for the culprit. Understand? Forgive him, Excellency, he's a poor man. He's not a bad man deep down. Exactly that is our mission. Go, my children, go, and get back to your work. - Thank you, Excellency. Thank you. And you, now, repent for what you've done. Pulchritudo per se ipsa non est peccatum. Beauty in itself is not a sin. Envy, on the other hand, is. Remember what I'm telling you, my child, in your penance. But Eminence, she wants to deprive my husband of his post. And so be it. So be it? - What does it mean, so be it? Carmela, all this for wanting to make your moronic cousin a tax collector. And I'll succeed. - OK, be careful, "too much breaks the bag". # Over the mountain I told you words of love # and in my boat, you said "do not despair". # Oh, little peasant with the shiny black hair, # Oh, rose mouth, the time when you kissed me # while you kissed me, you were regretting it. # But love is sinning, if it isn't sinning # and a kiss will blossom in the flower of our life. # Oh, little peasant with the shiny black hair, # ready is the cradle for a child of gold. # Born will he be in May, Born will he be in Spring # and his cradle will be my boat at sea. # Oh, little peasant with the shiny black hair, # Oh, rose mouth, the time when you kissed me, # while you kissed me, you were regretting it. # But love is sinning, if it isn't sinning # and a kiss will blossom in the flower of our life. Bravo! Bravo! - Thank you. Thank you. Listening to you is the soul's delight. - Tamquam sirenam! Like a Siren. When I told my nephew: "You will hear a celestial voice", he wouldn't believe me. Well then? You were right. You've won, Uncle. That's too kind of you all. Thank you. If you came to Naples you could sing at Court with your voice. No, no. Carmela is fine here, my lords. She learned to sing from the donkeys' brays. If she's gone from the countryside... - No! Your wife sang better than Circe. Too good of you, Excellency. Yes, she has excellent qualities, but they seem to cause some harm. Harm? What harm? - That comes from envy and gossip. My lords, you expect me to be happy with what happened earlier at the gate? I wasn't just worried for myself but for you gentlemen! You gentlemen who do me much honor. And it's more of an affront to you than to me! Right, Carm?? - Sure. It's a vile calumny. - Yeah, vile, you said it! But we'll still continue to come here as before. If anything, after this foolish gossip, we'll come here more often. - More often! Luca and I are so used to your visits! - It's always an honor! Now, is the time for my prayers. Must you go, Don Gennaro? - Yes, my daughter. It's time. I could stay here... with all my heart! You must do like Joshua: stop the sun! Ah, Don Gennaro, I've something for you. Excuse me. And now, Governor, the last glass. Pasqual?, bring the wine. This wine is from the lawyer's vineyard. Get me the wine! Nicola, bring the glasses! Why is that guy eating chicken? - He says he doesn't like lamb. - Yeah? Look, you can eat whatever you want at your home but not here. And it must turn into poison! - For you and your family! Mine is an honorable family. There are no spies nor ruffians! Want to repeat that? - There are no spies nor ruffians. You're boiling because Concettina married me. She didn't marry out of love, but out of interest. She preferred a handsome man to a loser. A nice house to a mill's cellar. A governor's secretary to a servant! Give that to me! Give it! Even Concettina must turn into poison! Even Concettina! Hey, Don Gennaro! This is for you. - Oh, thank you, my child. You have a soul as white as a dove. You never forget my poor venial sins. My sweet tooth! - We all have our pecadillos, Don Gennaro. Here is the wine! - Here, Sir! Today it's your turn to fill the cups. - A pleasure, Donna Carmela. Thank you. - To your health, Donna Carmela! Gardunia! Excellency? - My horse. The horse! Hurry! I swear, Donna Carmela... - It's the same thing I'm thinking? I wish it. - Then it's done. Well, let it be done! - Oh, Luca, it's done, the lawyer said so! - What? We'll grind all his estate's grain! - Thank you, Sir. You're an angel. And angels are to be kissed! What's His Excellency doing? Aren't you having fun? These gatherings are becoming too crowded for me. Oh, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry too. I've so many things to tell you. - Me too, Excellency. - Tell me. Tell me all. - It's about the tax collector matter. It's all settled. - You've appointed my cousin? It's not the right time. And then, this doesn't just depend on me. On who then? - You. - Me? - Yes. Think about it. - I always do, Excellency. What a wind! I must get the clothes in. Excuse me, Excellency. Good night. Good night, all! Goodbye! - Good night! Too much honor kissing my wife's hand. You see? She's not used to it. Her hands are in the onions all day! Shall we leave together, Governor? - The clothes. No! No, no! I've some pressing business. Good afternoon, Sirs. - Excellency! Reverend fathers, good afternoon! - Good afternoon, Excellency! Excellency! Excellency! What are you doing here? Donna Carmela... Donna Carmela... Excuse me, but I can resist no longer. I feel worse than Tantalus! - Tantalus? Who is? - He was a wretch like me. He was starving and saw a lot of appetizing godsend, but couldn't eat it. He was thirsty, and saw water flowing at his feet. Clear and limpid water like your eyes, yet couldn't drink. Donna Carmela, I'm Tantalus, I'm thirsty! - So drink, Excellency! - Don't laugh! Because when you laugh I feel myself burn. Let go, Excellency! - How can I, when I've dreamed about this for so long! To feel how lovely you are! I bet you say that to all the women! - Yes, many. All lovely women, but none like you. None! None! What's with you today? - Today? I've gone back home 1,000 times emptyhanded! Donna Carm?, I'll appoint your cousin, your husband a tax director, even King of Spain! Yeah, sure! - Caramba, what did I say? You must feel my same passion! - Yeah, I feel it. - Donna Carm?, I love you! You drive me insane! I... I can't think straight. - Heavens, my husband! Let go! Let go of me! Forgive me, Excellency. Excellency! - You? I'll hang you! Help me get up! - Excellency! Imbecile! I... I'll hang you! - Why? What did I do? Excellency, I saw Carmela fleeing. - Exactly, she saw you and thought it was her husband. That's why she fled? The woman who fears her husband holds a lover in her heart. You think so? - Excellency, she loves you! She loves me! Cheer up, Excellency. It takes patience, with women. - I have it in spades! It takes some guile, Excellency. - I have that too! And maybe, Excellency, even... even a little force. How dare you to give me such advices? Come! Help me get up. No, no, she's really beautiful. - Especially her legs. But Nicoletto... - Just stating a fact, Uncle, expressing an opinion, simply, with no complacency. Oh, look. Here's the governor. Afternoon, Excellency! Where was he gone? - Don Gennaro, you know well, right? You mean that Donna Carmela... - No, no! Not Donna Carmela! But he, the governor, is baked like his lamb of today. It was magnificent, exquisite. - God's punishment. He chased all the women in sight. Finally, he met one who resists him and makes him suffer! Evening, reverend fathers. I'll go through here to get home quicker. - Good evening! Well... I don't want to be malicious, but even the baron... - In love with Donna Carmela? That's old news! - Dear Nicoletto, you are young. The devil uses many disguises to hide, especially the guise of a woman. Not the one of Donna Carmela, of course! - Well, it's understood! You talk too much, Don Luca. Play on! It's wonderful! Play on! Mom, I want to see the witch. - Mom, Mom, take us outside. Fine, we'll go. They always want it their way. - Nowadays children rule. Nanny, prepare the carriage. - Yes, Excellency. Mom, me too the witch! - Yes, dear. Where are you going? - Down with the children. To see the fair. What? Down in the street to mingle with the rabble during a peasant festival like any other woman? - I was going to ask you to join us. It won't hurt you to meet a few of your subjects. Lady, I know them well enough. The people are like a well's bottom, and we're.. the authority! Heaven! What ever do you know about poor people? Lady! My name has six surnames! Vila Medina, who led the Spanish people at the Crusades. Sandez! Who died for the liberty of Spain! Suarez de Figueroa! Who ended up hanged in Mexico for the people. By the people, you mean. It's the same, it's still people. But if it amuses you, you may go. - Thank you, Theophilus. Good day, Father Sir! - Good day. Hey there. Sybil, are you in a prophetic trance? - I'm in a prophetic trance. So then, divine for this young man who has love pains. Here, there's an infernal devil! 3 carlini. - Why? It's the tax for the fair. - I've never paid taxes and never will! It's the patron's day! - Silence, or I'll kick you out! It'll end, one day! Citizens, I've paid! And for the rest of your life, ladies, you'll be kissed by men! Smelling like a field of roses. Like a mimosa. Come! Come! - Smell. What a scent! Yes - Hey, how much? 5 carlini! - 5 carlini!? Too much. - Yes, it is. Buy it, Concettina, I'll pay for. - Oh, Pasquale! You used to call me Pasqualino. - Yeah... Pasqualino. What are you doing here? You left me for that damn cop! But I always think of you. Night and day. And you? - Me too. Always. At night too, Concettina? - At night too. Concettina, my love! Gardunia! Who, at night too, huh? Who, at night too? I told you not to go out! Go home! - Hey, this is mine! - Go! Home! Come, all, buy! Hi, Pasquale! - Wine! Hi. - Hey, what's wrong? Nothing's wrong! Death to the paladins! - Hold high the cross! # The lady was splendid More splendid than a shining star. # She was young and had relations with the son of a doctor. # But here is where her husband, of whom this is the picture, # caught in the act, the wife and her seducer. # And the husband wounded in his human feelings, # in the place of the sin, cut her by the neck. Ooh, see that? - # He then kept the head # under his own roof, # he put it under the bed and soon fell asleep. # A famous trial was held, and he was taught a lesson, # because he was soon sentenced to be hung till death would come. # And here will see the good people, that who sings is no deceiver, # because with a noose around his neck, here he remains hanged. Come on, I'm working here. Go on! # And here the story ends, a dolorous end. And if I did like her? - You? Oh, come on! Are you so sure of me? - Carmela, what kind of talk is this? You're in love with me! You think so? - Yes, I think so. And you're not jealous? - No, I'm not jealous. - No? You watch it! Come on, make no fuss. - I haven't sold anything, I can't pay you. Oh, yeah? Then, pay me in kind. - Alright. Here, Excellency. - What is this? This stuff is rotten! - And you're doing a cowardly action! Shut up! - Down with the cart! Get out of my way! - You, don't move! Let's go for a drink. Damn you! What's wrong, Carmela? - Nothing. Giddap! Carm?, what now? - I want to do the swing. - The swing? Are you crazy? You're married! - So? Won't they see your legs? - Why, are they ugly? Forget about it. - Ah, you're jealous. Me jealous? Come to the swing! - Carmela. I'm going. Look at that! Hi, Luca. - Hi. Carmela, get down! Donna Carmela! Excellency! Excellency, come! What is it? There's Donna Carmela on the swing. - Donna Carmela on the swing? - Yes. Quick, get the spyglass! How beautiful! What legs! Gardunia, I can't sleep, can't eat because of this woman! What if I get sick? - Hopefully not. - If I don't get her, I... I'll send you to the gallows! - No, no, Excellency! We'll do all we can! To the gallows. How shameless! How beautiful. Oh, "How beautiful"? Idiot, come home! Get down, Carmela! No! Carmela, I told you to get down! - No! Why do you want to interrupt the show? Here's to lovely legs! What did you say? That's my wife. Your wife? Excuse me. My compliments! Hey, what're you doing? Continue! Continue! I'm paying for all! Go on, go on! Musician! Take this and play some music! Hurry! Carmela! I order you to get down! Come on! Death to the tax collectors! What's going on, Gardunia? Help! Quick, quick, to the palace! Excellency, come inside. - What? A governor stays at his post in such cases! Pasqu?! The revolution! - The revolution? But I'm... I'm Ciccillo! - Oh, Cicc?, forgive me! Down with the tax collectors! Luca! Look there! That's the end you deserve. In jail! - Well done! - You see? He's going to jail! Carmela! - Luca! Stop! Stop! Carmela! Go home, I'll be right back! Come on, move! Hold the mules! Luca! Luca, love, what will they do to you? What can they do? I'll be out in 30 minutes! Hurry up! - Don't worry, I'll talk to the governor. Bring the mules home, and shut yourself inside! No, Theophilus. I'm not exaggerating. - You're always ready to pity them. I saw it with my own eyes: The poor were abused, beaten with rifle butts, carried off to prison! So why do they rebel? Believe me, Ma'am, you can't understand politics. How can women understand State problems? You call them State problems? It's a question of humanity. The people suffer, persecuted and suffocated by the taxes. One moment, one moment! Taxes... are needed! Needed to pay the soldiers! Who are needed to subdue the people's indignation.. aroused by the new taxes. Is that clear? You really have no mercy! - Ah! Mercy! They just want to be pitied, all they do is shout and cry to move the rulers to pity! But I won't fall for it! Not me! Theophilus... What you've done today is very serious. I don't know who advised you. - I don't need any advice from anybody! Understand that! You've imposed a new tax just on the day of the patron saint. I'm sure His Majesty, the King of Spain, wouldn't approve. What? What do you mean to say? His Majesty might even take away the authority he conferred on you. Baron! Your advice... Some fine advice! I'll tell his Catholic Majesty. You'll lose your fief! Dolores... According to you, what... should I do? Free them. Restore them to their homes and their families. Calm, Excellency. All is calm. My wife... with her ideas! Free them all! Free them all! After they rebelled! Force is needed! Again? You hear them? I'll hang them all! He's wounded! They injured the governor! His Excellency hurt? Oh, God! - They killed the governor! They killed the governor! This is... red ink not blood! Excellency, Excellency, I think that setting them free is the wisest thing to do, Excellency. - What? You too? Yes, when the sea is rough, the captain throws off the oil and goes on sailing peacefully. Don't you think so, Baron? Certainly! - What do you say, Excellency? What shall we do, Excellency? - Wait! It's me who decides. Decided, Excellency? Liberate all. - Yes, all! Except one: Luca the miller. - Why? Why? Agreed? I'll see to the order of liberation, Excellency. Come on, don't be so worried! When I talk to the governor, everybody will be let out. Don't waste your breath, Luca. The governor only helps those who do him certain favors. Fine. I'll tell him that in the future you'll be more quiet. That's a favor, no? Besides the governor is a man like anybody. You gotta know how to treat him. - I know how to... but not as you mean. Where do you think you'll get with violence? You don't need riots to get something, you need to be cunning. You call it cunning? - Why? What would you call it? Carmela. That's what I call it. My wife helps me. What's wrong with that? She does nothing dishonest. I can hold my head high without paying taxes! Forget it, cause you're paying a tax too! Hey, be careful what you say, or.. - He said right. I'd rather have the governor in his palace than inside my house! The governor comes into my house with the utmost respect! Because me and him are like this! See? And you're the one above or below? I'm neither above nor below! You are below. And there you'll stay. In life you have to know how to get by. For not rotting in jail, it takes one like me. By order of his Majesty the King our lord, may God protect him, all those who have been arrested today during the riots in the main square, by an act of clemency of His Excellency the governor, have been pardoned and will be released. I knew it. - Oh, Luca, this we owe to you. More to you than to the king of Spain. - Well, to both of us. Bye, Luca, thanks a lot! - Bye. Thank you, Excellency! Hey, Captain, see you around! - One moment, Luca. Let's drink a glass of wine to celebrate. Very honored. - The honor is mine. This way. And the riot? - It's all over. Everything. I'm glad. - After you. No, after you. - No, sorry, you're my guest. Captain, I don't want to intrude. - Intrude? It's my duty. Duty? - Yes, yes, my duty. Yes, a duty I do with pleasure, but still a duty. Thanks. To the governor's health! - Cheers! Excellent. - Have some more. - Thanks. To the governor's health! - Cheers. Good stuff, eh? - Well, Captain, I gotta go now. - No! Please, sit down, Luca. - No, honestly, I must... Now you must try a terrific cake. Captain, no cake! I really gotta go, got stuff to do. Another time, OK? Another time. Hey, what are you doing? - Sorry, Luca, my boy. But you cannot leave here. What did you say? Orders from the governor. - The governor? Captain, have you gone mad? - No, Luca, no. Exact orders. You must stay here as guest of honor until the morning's dawn. - Until dawn? But why? - I ask no questions. I follow orders. I'm a soldier. And I'm a civilian who wants to know why I must stay here tonight. It's just one night, a few hours. Sleep in that bed... in my room. No, no, Captain, I can't stay here Carmela's waiting for me. I can't leave in her the mill alone. Well... - What does that "well" mean? I said "well" just to say "Let's drink on it". You didn't just say "well", you said "well...". That's different! And one can't say "well..."? - No! Not when my wife is named! - Bah! And no "bahs"! - Hey, Luca! Are you mad? One can't say "well" and "bah"? You must tell me what you mean when you say "bah" and "well"! Nothing. What should I think? - Not true! You're thinking of something! If you must know, I'm thinking the same thing you are! Come on. Don't be cast down. I too had to endure that. How do you think I got to be captain? The bad luck is that she ran away with another. If not, who knows what career I'd have! She was beautiful. Almost as much as your wife. You know what I did then? I'd get drunk! And the next morning, it was all over. Come on. Drink! Drink some! Drink! Let's drink together! You're right! Let's drink on it! - That's it! That's how I like you! To your health! You'll see how you'll like me when I'm drunk! To the health of your wife! More, Captain! Luca! You stay here, watch the horses. And keep your eyes open. - Yes, Sir. Why did we stop at the bridge? So you can reach the mill's rear. - So what? You can enter in quietly without the danger of being seen. Oh, right! Shall I go then? - Yes, Excellency, go on. Are you really sure... - Of what? That the miller... - He's in jail, Excellency, have no fear. Fear? How dare you? - Sorry, Excellency. Help, Gardunia! Help, Gardunia, I can't swim, help! - Excellency! Excellency, hold on! Donna Carm?, his Excellency is drowning! Pasqualino, I hear people. Get up, I'm scared! Oh, my Concettina... - Ooh, drunk again! My Concettina... Run, Carmela, his Excellency is drowning! You idiot, hurry! I can't hold on. - For heaven's sake, hang on! I can't hold on, Gardunia! I can't! Do something, let's save His Excellency! Hold on, Excellency! - I can't anymore! Don't let me die! - Hold onto this pole! Come on, hold to this! - Here, here! How much water I drank! What a fright I had! Take heart, Excellency, it was nothing. Nothing. Take heart. Sit here. Excellency. Do something, we must dry off his Excellency! There, there, Excellency. Excellency, I don't understand, what happened? I was horribly attacked! It was diabolical! Infernal! There must have been many! I defended myself, but I slipped... And fell into the water! I didn't see anybody. - You never do! But you'll see the hangman, just wait! Some wine, Excellency? I can't! I already drank so much. How wet you are, my poor Excellency. - Carmela. Lovely Carmela. Carm?. What are you doing here? And where is Luca? Oh, my head! Calm down, Carmela. - Why must I calm down? Where's Luca? What have you done to him? Don't be angry, Carmela. I came on account of that. Is he still in jail? - Unfortunately. - Unfortunately? The others were released! - But not him. Right Gardunia? He's watched on sight. He can't leave. He can't leave, that's right. He can't. But Luca hasn't done anything, Excellency! - I know, I know! I know he hasn't. Well then, Excellency? Nothing. He did it and how! What did he do, Gardunia? What? The report is absolutely clear. - Very clear! Many accusations. - Many, many, many. The first: provocation. - Yes. The second? Aggression. - Third? Inciting to riot. - Fourth? Insubordination. - Fifth? Resistance to His Majesty, the King of Spain's guards. Sixth? - The sixth is... Excellency, there's no more. - What do you mean no more? He'll be referred to the court. - The court, the court. No, Excellency, not the courts! No, please, Excellency, no! The court. Yes, he'll be hanged. - Hanged? No, Excellency, not that! God! He needs a lesson, poor boy! Help! The devil! The devil! Excellency, do it for me! - For you! You know how much I love you! I told you a thousand times, whatever you want, I'll do anything. I came on purpose to save him. - Thank you, Excellency. Gardunia! The orders! Here is the order to nominate as tax collector your cousin by His Catholic Majesty, the King... - Who cares? Luca! Save Luca! Luca? I also thought about him. Here is the order for your husband's freedom. Thank you, Excellency! Thanks! Thanks. Carm?! Carm?! Oh, no! This for now... will stay with me... Excellency? Excellency, you're shivering. You should go at once to bed. Sorry. And why? To bed? - And you ask me? You must put something warm on your chest. Very warm. Right, right! That's true. I'm cold, Carmela. I'm cold. Well.. Alright, Excellency. If you want you can come to my room. This way. Make yourself at home. You see, Excellency? I told you. I know women well. They only need a pretext to put their conscience at ease. Go on. But make me proud! How dare you? Excellency! - What is it? You forget this. Ah, good. Well done. - Did it break? - No, not at all. You watch the house. Watch well! Don't worry. Don't worry! Carmela... We are alone. Excellency, the bed is ready. Here's a nightshirt. - A shirt? You don't want to keep those wet clothes on. And here are the socks. Your feet will be cold. You're a beauty. I'll put this under here. Is it your husband's? - Yes. Now I'm Luca. But the governor too! - Excellency... No, not Excellency. Call me Theophilus. Yes, sure. - Your Theophilus. Oh, your hands are cold. - Yes, I'm freezing with emotion. This is the first time that I've felt like this before such beauty. I feel like... ... a child. - Excellency, you're shivering, you need to rest. Don't worry. - How can I not worry, Excellency? Theophilus! - Yes, now go to bed. I'll make you some hot wine which'll give you strength. OK? - Fine. But come back soon. - Immediately. At last! How warm it is in here, Donna Carm?! - Yes. And you'll see that this will cure all your ills. I've only one ill, just one: you! Will I heal from it? - Well.. how can I tell? I don't know. Yes, you do. You won't tell me because you're bad! - No... Will I heal, tell me, will I? - I think so, Excellency. Excellency? - Oh, sorry. The... - Theo..? I can't, I'm embarrassed. - Bewitching! Good - A little more then? - And if it goes to my head? Wouldn't it be nice? Nice, nice... great! Drink with me. - No, no need for me, I'm dizzy already. You're dizzy? Beautiful! Probably from your perfume. Ah, the perfume. You like it? Smell this. Balsamic vapor for the pains of love. No, Excellency! What are you doing? Give me a kiss. - No! Why not? Forgive me. You must understand me. You're too aggressive. Me? Well, I'm a soldier ! I'll close the door. - Yes. Carmela, believe me, I love you and I want to prove it. It was of my grandmother, a Ferrer of Catalonia! - What? Look. Is it for me? - Yes, for you. Take it. Oh! Excuse me. But, what have you done? Pearls, rubies, diamonds... I don't deserve so much. - You don't? You deserve the Crown of Spain's treasure! If it were mine, it'd be yours. - Don't forget I'm a peasant. You are a queen. You are the woman the most... the most beautiful in the world! What are you doing? - I've always wanted a golden jewel. But I've never seen one as pretty as this. I'll give you many more, Carmela. All the jewels of my ancestors. Of Ramirez, of Fernandez, of Mendoza, of Ferrer... I'll give you one each day, Carm?. Say something, Carmela, say something. Well? How pretty! Forget the brooch, Carmela! Think a little about me. Yes. You are right. What now? You're leaving? - Want me to go to bed like this? Oh, right! Excuse me. Beautiful! Pasqualino, wake up! - Who's that? Gardunia. Help me tie him up. What are you going to do? - I know what I'll do. Hat and coat are for me. Carmela. The other! The other one, Carmela! Carmela? Carmela, the other one! Here it is! And now, turn around, and wait for me. - Yes! I understand. You want to be even more beautiful. Gardunia! Carmela? Carmela! I'll kill her! "We, the governor, hereby notify the appointment as tax collector..." Traitors! # And here will see the good people, that who sings is no deceiver, # because with a noose around his neck, here he remains hanged. Take that! That's for kicking me today. Take that! That's for taking away my Concettina. Take that! That's for all the poison I've in my body! Pasqualino! The... the governor! Governor? It's me, Luca. Strip Gardunia and put on his clothes. - What's happening? Come on, hurry! - Yes. "Also the Governess is beautiful" I'm ready. - Hurry! What are we doing? - March! I've an order from the governor. - Wait one moment. Chief! - What is it? I must speak to the captain! - Now? - Governor's orders. - Come. Easy. This way. Wait! Captain Sir! Captain Sir! Open up! Who is it? What time is it? Midnight! - Go to hell! - But there's an order from the governor! At this hour? What? - Captain, I've this order! - Oh, Donna Carmela! Close the door. - Governor's orders: Free my husband! I wasn't expecting you at this night hour... and so soon! Don't joke, Captain! Free Luca! Right away, Carmela. Facing governor's orders... He's there. - Inside? Luca! Luca! - He's locked inside. It'll be hard to wake him. We had a good drinking night, talking about you! Fine, but open! - Here we go. I'll leave you alone. - Luca! Luca! Oh, God, he escaped! Captain! Captain! - What is it? - Luca has escaped! - Where? How? - How? Out the window! If he reaches the mill and finds him, he'll kill him! Who? - The governor! - The governor! Jorge! Give the alarm! Hurry, Captain! - Quick, the horses! The horses, horses! Carm?, what are you doing? I'm waiting. His Excellency the Governor! Shut it. Good evening, Excellency. But you're not the govern... Carmela! Don't jest. It's not the time to play hide and seek! Pasqualino! Donna Carm?... Excellency! It's been so long since you came to see me. I thought you had forgotten me. Excellency! Gardunia! Concettina! Pasqualino! How did you get in? Concettina, I love you so much that I took the risk. And Gardunia? - I left him with the hens. This night is all for you, my Concettina! I love you so, Concettina. Oh, my Pasqualino! Stop, Donna Carmela! You, come with me! Gardunia, help! Where are you? I'll have you hanged! His Excellency! Here I am! He killed him! - Stop, Donna Carmela! Come, let's go! I killed him! Gardunia, I killed him! Yes, Excellency, I'm dead! You? Are you dead? Excellency... How dare you? Silence! You... Go that way! I said that way! - Excellency! The guards! Oh God, they'll arrest us! How can they arrest us? You're the governor! Right! I'm the governor. Light the candle. Keep still, Dona Carmela! Who's there? The miller and his helper! Murderers! Arrest them! No! Luca! - Be still, Donna Carmela! Seize them! Leave him alone! Luca! Luca, what have you done? His Excellency! I am the governor! I am the governor! His Excellency! Your Excellency... - I'm the governor... Then it was him. He killed my husband! Murderer! Me? Gardunia! Murderer! - Come here, calm the widow. Murderer! - Donna Carmela, I beg you, keep still. Let her alone. Let her alone! Let her alone. But, Carmela, what's going on? - Where's the body? We'll get rid of it. What body? - The miller's. - I haven't seen any miller! Gardunia, cut me a little lemon rind. Why, Excellency? - 'Cause the rind is good for a black eye. Hold on, it heals, it heals!! I want to go home! Get me my clothes. Excellency, your clothes are gone! - My clothes? Who took my clothes? - Find the governor's clothes! My clothes! There's a note. - A note? What does it say? "Also the Governess is beautiful." - Yes, she is. Very beautiful, Excellency. - Agreed. What does my wife have to do with this? Who dares to do such praises? This... this was written by Luca! - Luca? Why? To take revenge! - Why? Oh, Luca! What have you done? What have you done? What did Luca do? - Well... What "well"? Why? How dare you? - It's not me who dares but Luca! Guards, come with me! Quick! To the palace! To the palace! To the palace! Good evening, Ma'am. - Good evening, Excellency. Theophilus! Why are you standing there? Answer me. Drunk! But... where have you been? Theophilus! What's gotten into you? Please! Theophilus? How many years it's been since you've behaved like this! Dear! Theophilus... And your mustache? I'm not Theophilus, Ma'am! Who are you? - I'm Luca, the miller! The one with the beautiful wife! That guy! And your husband enjoys himself with my wife! Not true! - I saw with my own eyes! I surprised them! And I didn't kill them because... because... Because I wanted a better revenge! But I didn't succeed... I couldn't do it! Nanny! Nanny! But I'll wait here, Ma'am. Indeed, we'll wait together! I want my revenge, I have a right! Waken everyone and bring them here! - Yes, yes! The whole palace, here! Hold the bridles. The guard's not here. Your governor is here! Make them open, knock on the door. Make them open, knock on the door! Open up! Open up! Open! Open, it's me the governor! Open! - Dolores! Dolores! Open! - And you, make them open immediately! I'm the governor! You, make them open this door immediately! I want to get in! Who is it? Oh! The nanny! The nanny! Nanny! Open up! It's me! - Who's "me"? What do you mean "who"? I'm the governor! I'm the master! Governor, my eye! Don Theophilus is in bed since an hour. Luca, I'm here! It's Carmela! - Nanny! Nanny, don't you recognize me? Yet you've nursed me! - Like I said, the governor is in bed. I saw him, with my own eyes, go to bed with his wife! Traitor! He's a traitor! Unfaithful spouse! Unfaithful spouse! Enough with this shouting! What's this scandal? The scandal is what the Governess is doing tonight! Yes, Excellency. Captain! Arrest that woman! And bring her up here! Orders of the Governess! Yes, take me up there so I'll see them in the face! Bring me up there, I want to see them in the face! I want to see them too! I'm the governor! Gardunia, do something! Kill, destroy, whatever, but this door must be opened! How cold it is in this damn town! Let go of me! Well? At last, I've the pleasure of seeing face to face one of those hussies! Hey, Carmela! - You like my husband? To me! Have you gone mad? It's your own guilt which makes you imagine such things. Yeah, my guilt! Let go, Captain! You... you're not worthy of having a husband like yours! Nanny! Have him come in! - Right away, Excellency. I had him arrested because he was like a madman. He wanted revenge. - What do you want? Come forward! - Let go of me! Luca! Shut up, you slut! Here's your husband. He entered my room and maybe he could've carried out his revenge. But he didn't want to. Because of you. Because he loves you! Even though you're not worthy. But then, Luca... I swear that I... - Don't swear! Try to save whatever decency is left in you! I did nothing! - Shut up, harlot! You've learned well to play the part, huh? If you allow me, Excellency, I'd like to clear up a misunderstanding. This woman is a flower of purity and virtue. You! Just you! How would you know? You went boozing, in your times! No, Luca, no. Donna Carmela came to me to free you. She had the order of release. - Of course, a wedding gift! I'd have rather stayed in jail! - Luca, please believe me. - You? And how? With my own eyes I saw her there with the governor! I saw you through the keyhole! The keyhole? - Yeah! Then it wasn't Gardunia! - What does Gardunia have to do with it? Then it was you? With his clothes? - Yeah, and so? I was behind you! Behind the door. I was going out and I saw you come in. You came tiptoeing. - Yes. Then you took a glass. - Yes! So while you were watching in the keyhole I ran off with the release order. Then... - I was besides myself. I wanted to free you so we could go together far from this place. My lovely Carmela! - Luca! - My lovely Carmela! Luca! - I've had so many ugly thoughts! If you knew what I went through last night! My lovely Carmela! Thank God! Thank God! Free him. Yes, Excellency. - Luca! My Carmela. - My Luca. Let's go. - Luca... Pardon me, Excellency. We're poor people, blame it on that. Sometimes we make mistakes. But I never thought it would end like this. And with such shame. - Forgive us. Will you forgive us, Excellency? You're forgiven. - Thanks, Excellency! - One moment, Luca. You were very able in entering my palace. So skillful as to deceive even me. Now, you must help me. - Yes, Excellency. You must do everything I say. - I'll do whatever you tell me. Nanny! Listen to me well. What are we doing? - I don't know, Excellency. What are you doing here? Sergeant, what are you doing? - We're watching. Watching what? Come and watch this! There you go! Who is this? - Well... dunno. What? - It's the governor! Yeah, he looks like him. Doesn't he? Looks like him. Yeah, he does, he does. And they blame me for hanging them! How many men are there? - Where? Valets, cooks, soldiers, servants... In the palace? 47. - Prepare 47 gallows, I'll hang them all. I mean 48: also the nanny. - Yeah, also the nanny! You may enter. - Ah! About time! So we may go in, eh? On your feet! - What are you doing? Stand up! Why should I? - "Why should I"? I am the governor!- He's the governor! - I AM THE GOVERNOR! His excellency the governor! What's going on? - What do they want, these peasants? What do we want? Get down from there or I'll hang you! I won't allow you to insult my husband like that! One more word and I'll order your arrest! I'm Theophilus, Dolores. I'm your "Fifi", don't you recognize me? Ah, yes. I recognize you. You're Luca. Luca, the miller. A miller? - Don't raise your voice! Why do you protest? What did they do to you? Done to me? I'm asking that to you! What have you done with my honor tonight, Ma'am? Arrest the impostor! - What are you talking about, Luca? The governor of the city... the justice representative, the king's envoy, would not gad about at such an hour, and in such a guise! But I... I... But you, you... you're a madman! You say you're the governor, you call my wife Dolores... Come, what are you doing at the palace at this time of night? - But... It's my home. - Yes, it's also your home. It's my home! - Sure! You are a citizen, and the governor's palace is the palace of all his people. Go on, speak up. - "Speak up" is for me to say! I see. You came here to protest against me, eh? Yes! - It's fair! Fair. Tonight I couldn't sleep thinking about today's revolt. Too many impositions, too much abuse, too many unjust taxes. And the people rebel. I see that I was wrong. How could I put a tax on rain and on marriage? Rain makes the grain grow, which can be used to pay taxes. And if you have no children, who will pay taxes? Right. Nobody. Right, Gardunia? See how simple everything is, dear Luca. I want to confess to you. No one can govern a people without knowing them. And the brain must be used to govern, not for other men's wives! Enough! - And I humbly and publicly ask my consort's pardon, who has had to put up with so much. - Enough, I won't allow anymore! Enough! Yeah. Enough. You're right too, Excellency. - What are you doing? Excuse me, Ma'am. But the fault is not only those who govern... but also those who think they can take without giving back. There are many people better than me. People who suffer. But who aren't as sly. Shall we go, Carm?? Everybody leave. My lady, what have you done with my honor tonight? Tell me! Go put on your clothes. And try to be worthy of them! Dolores! A year has passed. And they celebrate, once again, the patron saint. Music, boys! The band, the band! Excuse me, Dolores. Do you hear how the people hail me? And you should be very proud of that, Theophilus. - Of course! Dolores. - What, Theophilus? I've done everything you've wanted. Every day I followed your advice. I annulled the unjust taxes, favoritism, unnecessary force and all injustice. You've done well. - I've hung Gardunia... In that, you were wrong. - No, he expected it. Every day I'd tell him "I'll hang you, I'll hang you." Well! I had to do it once, also as a question of honor. Dolores. A year ago, remember? You promised me before the Virgin of Pilar, that today, you'll tell me the truth. I remember, Theophilus. Dolores, tell me. That night, here in the palace, what happened? You really want to know? Yes. Whatever I may tell you? Yes, Dolores. - You will be.. strong? Yes. - Fine then. The Virgin of Pilar, tonight, while I was praying, told me to tell you the whole truth next year, on this very feast day. Come, come, Theophilus! Come on! Put your back into it, boys! What are you doing? - Look how happy my Concettina is. Last night I gave her a nice gift. I think you've weakened some, eh? Eh, Luca, love is like the spring: it weakens. Concettina! Is that how you help me? What a perfume, Donna Carm?! Pasqualino bought it for me at the fair. Yeah, it's nice. Now help me. Luca, look who's coming! Good day, Luca. - Good day. Here we are. - Tax collection. How much this time? - Five carlini. One, two, three, four... And five. And five for the grind. - Even that? Goodbye, Luca. - Goodbye. Yeah, have a good laugh! What is it? Paying taxes is a fine nuisance, eh? That's right. If you want, we can set up the arbor... and invite all our friends: the lawyer, the baron, the governor... No, no, no! Better to pay the taxes. You really love me then? No? Why not? Because you're ugly, Carmela! Ugly! English subtitles by sineintegral and edam17 @KG - May 2016
