Sleep climbs over the walls Of time and lands in a dream On waking, a tail twirls between his legs A cigarette-burnt finger A forgotten dream Where did this tail come from? How can I go out with this? Maybe only I can see it! Be quiet, boy. Shut up. Get inside. Come on! Yes. A tail has grown out of nowhere. Everyone's staring at me! Can women ever have peace of mind? -Hey! -Hey! -Pervert! Who do you think you are? -Catch hold of him! What do I do now? Last night, I went to sleep. I don't know what happened when I was asleep. I woke up with a tail grown on me. But I won't meet a psychiatrist. Whatever comes in my sleep is just a dream. But I can't remember anything! Is the dream a problem? My strange dream has caused me a lot of suffering. It has left me confused. The dreams within dreams has crippled me. The taste of madness is stuck to my tongue and I would often grind my teeth at night. My wife complained that she couldn't sleep peacefully at night. I will still not meet the psychiatrist. If I meet the psychiatrist and tell him about my dream, they'll just make up some disease, chain me up… and brand me a madman. I was tortured by the dream's evil energy and consumed by darkness. At that time, I saw a titled house under a banyan tree near the Kelambakkam Bus stand. There lived a soothsayer who interprets dreams. My wife's younger brother said that her predictions always come true. Grandma. Grandma. Who's that? I came to see you. Why did you come to meet me? I heard that you interpret dreams. That's what the blog said. What does a "blag" mean? It means, a computer. Why do they write about all this? No one needs to know. We want to stay hidden. I heard that your interpretations are always correct. If my children found out, they'd kill me! Why are you squirming? That's my problem. That's why I came to see you. What is your problem? Tell me. Do dreams come true, Grandma? Of course! Dreams are nothing but the world's desires. By interpreting dreams… they were able to save an entire country from famine. What are you saying? During Biblical times, there once lived a king. He had a strange dream. He dreamt of seven fat buffaloes who were grazing in a field. And out of nowhere, seven famished-looking buffaloes appeared… and swallowed the seven healthy buffaloes. No one knew its meaning. The ministers racked their brains but it was of no use. Then, a fortune-teller… who had heard of the king's predicament… listened to the dream and gave an interpretation. The seven fat buffaloes signified… seven years of prosperity. The seven starving buffaloes represented… seven years of famine. The past seven prosperous years… will be swallowed by seven years of famine. Through this, they were able to prevent the famine. Instead of looking at dreams as disorders, they searched for its meaning and solved many problems. Why are you squirming continuously? That's the problem, Grandma! I was sleepy last night. I fell asleep. I think… I had a dream. I woke up with a startle! I woke up and realized… that I'd grown a horse's tail. Look here! What? Yes, Grandma! There's no tail! What are you saying, Grandma? Can't you see the tail? It's right here! It isn't visible to me! Really? Even while you are talking to me, the tail is thrashing from head to toe! How did the tail grow? What was your dream? I can foretell only if you tell me your dream. I can't remember anything. Close your eyes and think. See if you remember anything. "Atop an endless wall, embedded with shards of glass, walks elegantly, a word called "cat". Yes, a word. When it is followed for a while, it turns into a sentence. And if the sentence's motion, were pierced by a shard of glass, the blood that trickles down the wall and can be read like a poem. If you expect it to be a poem about a cat, you will be fooled." In an affluent apartment building in West Mambalam, a middle-aged man was found dead along with 200 syringes of blood. The man, identified as Babu, is survived by his wife and daughter. I am the oasis That quenches thirst wherever you go Hello, sir. Are you off to work? I am the tune sung by waterfalls In the mountains Look at them. The dogs aren't like humans. They express their deepest feelings by licking. That's the reason why their tongue is always moist. Hey! -Hey. -Give me a clove cigarette. -I survive with whatever I find next -Hey! Where are you going? -And satiate my hunger everyday -Hey! The scene changes even as we see it How mysterious is this life? With no goal or yearning I am the wonder that lives on Don't get me wrong, sir. I didn't steal the flame. I just shared it. Loneliness is not a good feeling. We only see doors having conversations in apartments. Loneliness is a never-ending spiral. It goes on and on. Once when I was sleeping, I woke up and saw that all the loneliness in my heart overflowed in the form of tears from my eyes. That's when I got the frog. By "frog", I don't mean the actual frog but him. This leash… is not meant to control him. This is the bond between us. Let's go. Sir. You haven't filled the account holder's name. What's the account holder's name? Please fill it. Name? Why do you need the name? Why are these stupid formalities needed? I can tell you the account number, and you can verify it. I've filled the branch name correctly, right? You can check it with the same. Why do you need the name? You've labelled everything with numbers, right? If I deposit a large sum of cash, you'll ask for my PAN number. If that isn't enough, you'll ask for ID proof as well. Everything is marked in numbers anyway. Token number-- Isn't name a pointless identity? Counter number two! Sir… aren't you Professor Stuart Koteeswaran? Sir, I'm your student! How are you? I tried to draw your name from the vault of my lost memory by scratching my head. It's been ages, right? One minute, sir. Get back to work now. Visit me at home later. Definitely, sir. See you, then. There is a gap over there. Why isn't a gap here? Maybe humans are used to seeing everything through a window. Token number three. Counter number two. Token number five. Counter number two. The account number is wrong. The account number is wrong! Did you hear what I said? Hello, Mr. Saravanan? Sorry, wrong-- Sir, isn't this flat 11-B? What do you want? Sir, I'm from IDB Life Insurance. -Okay. -Don't your remember me? No. Sir, the nameboard reads Saravanan a well. Is today a holiday? I'm a bit stressed. I can see that, sir. Sir, we had a premium plan six months ago and I had come as a representative of my company. -Sorry. Something seems wrong. -No. -There's no one here by that name. -No, sir. I spoke to you on the phone yesterday. Excuse me. Didn't you explain this yesterday? Tell me the formalities. Let's get it over with. Definitely, sir. Sir… "Saravanan." You need to fill the name as "Saravanan." Please fill the application… and sign on the places I've marked. I think you don't remember it. It's Saravanan, sir! Sir, you had filled your name as "Saravanan" in the previous year's application as well. I remember it. My name is Freud! No, sir. Your name is Saravanan. I'm sure about it. Counter number five. Sir! Sir! Sir! Mrs. Kowski Kirupaakaran, can you manage my counter for ten minutes? -Sir. -Wait a minute. Please process my transaction first. Token number one-- I got a call from the apartment. I forgot to close the tap. Can I go out for ten minutes? I'll just close it and come back. Okay, who will look after your counter? Mrs. Kowski Kirupaakaran said that she will handle it. Okay, make it quick. Thank you, sir. He is always careless! Token number one. Counter-- In the fire accident that occurred at Ervadi's private sanatorium, more than 30 mentally challenged patients were killed. After this, the High Court passed a rule to not chain the patients. Though the practice was abolished, but situations have changed recently. The practice of chaining patients in mental institutions is resurfacing. Amazon forest is home to over one million people. Their representatives cite capitalist greed as the main reason for these fires. Corporates plunder natural resources-- Oh, no! I'm late. Ms. Kowski. Token number three-six-- Counter number five. Hello? Saravanan? Hello? Sir, I'm at a client's place. The client's name is Saravanan, sir. But he says it's Freud! His previous application reads the name as "Saravanan." I think maybe he changed his name. What's your name, mister? What's your name? Would you like it if I changed your name? Sir. You're trying to destroy my identity. -Sir? You're getting me-- -You're all in on this together. No, sir. I'm just a marketing-- What proof do you have that I'm Saravanan? -Aadhaar-- Sir! -Tell me! I have your government ID! If you show me your Aadhaar card, we can clarify this once and for all. Sir, I'll call you back. No problem, sir. Here. Have a look at it. Sir! The cheque will bounce! What are you doing? You're filling it wrong-- It says "Saravanan" here! Your company is trying to erase my identity. -Come on, sir-- -You're trying to erase my identity. You're that company's henchman. How would you feel if I changed your name? That's not possible-- Do you think you can band together, erase my identity, and turn me into a madman? Of course not, sir! I think you're worked up. You're worrying for no reason. Are you making me a refugee in my own country? Sir! Sir, I think you're upset. Sir, I work for the private sector. You can't treat me this way. I can't hear you! Speak a little louder. Listen to me, sir! Saravanan! -I've been waiting for so long. -Sir, listen to me. -Sir? -The manager will be here. -Saravanan, everyone's watching! -Sir, what are you doing? -Stop that. -He is not answering me. What the hell! The customers are waiting here, and he's playing with a ball! Sir! Sir! What's happening here? Customers are waiting and he's playing! Saravanan! Saravanan? Do you know what you're doing? Can you hear me? Saravanan! Why are you doing this? Please maintain the decorum of the bank, Saravanan! This is definitely going to be a black mark on your track record. Saravanan, this is incorrigible. Just give me the ball! Saravanan! Saravanan, this is incorrigible. Saravanan, just give me the ball! Saravanan! Hey! -What happened? -You don't know? What do you think? -It's nothing, sir. -Where's the security? Did he call the police? -Security! -What are you doing? Call the police. Where the hell were you? I am coming, sir. Slave of America's autocracy! You traitor! I'll kill you! Burn to ashes! Stop mumbling! I can't hear you! Do you think you can drive me crazy? You American mercenary! You erase my name and wage psychological war for the sake of an incentive! I'll meet you at the International Court of Law. -This is a psychological war. -You shouldn't be spared! Psychological war. I'll win this war against the multinational corporation. I'll sue this establishment for defamation. Conspiracy! Betrayal! Psychological war! Psychological war! Sir, calm down. Take this pill. -Sir, please don't. Don't play here. -Dude. Stop that! -Please stop playing here. -What is wrong with you? Please don't, sir. Calm down, sir. -Just watch what I do to you. -Listen to me. -I can't wait to kick you out of here! -Sir! Catch that mad dog! If you try to lift me, you'll be here all day. Go, catch him instead! -Sir, please give me that ball. -Call the police. Wait right there! Get hold of him and take him to the police. Call the police. Get a hold of him! -Sir, why are you behaving like a child? -I won't spare you! -Mr. Saravanan. -Get him! Holy Mary Mother of God. What did he do? Sir, he was playing with a ball. What? Playing with a ball? -Is this why you called the station? -No, sir. -You have-- -Sir, excuse me. We have a final process to complete. Confiscate his ID card. Sir, hand over your ID card. Sir, this is your dismissal order. I had a steady income of 35,000 rupees. Why did I do that? What will I do for a living now? It's good that the police let me go with a warning. Or else I don't know what would've happened. Psycho! Don't you dare come here again. Go and bounce that ball on your father's head. Sir! I'm the policeman here. Let me do my job. Would they have hung me? Give me the ball! Hello, Mr. Babu! Sir! Sir! Mr. Saravanan! He's angry. Please leave. Ask him to give me my ball. Go there. -Don't let him in! Throw him out! -I need my ball, sir. -I'll take my ball and leave. -Sir. -I need my ball. -Are you listening to me or not? -Don't try to pacify me. -Why aren't you listening to me? Throw him out of office! -Can you please stop shouting? -You scum! Get out! You only have the right to fire me, not to confiscate my ball. -Give my ball back. I'll leave. -Hey! To heck with you! Hey! Sir! Now you're here? Chase him out! Don't ever let him come in again! I can see what I missed. But I just saw it! How can it go missing? What are you looking for outside, Mr. Babu? Frog and I had been for our evening walk. You came walking in the opposite direction. I greeted you… but you must've been lost in thought. There's scotch. Will you have a drink? It all depends on the accompaniment. It's nothing great. We will have a conversation. Should I mix water? Have you heard of the Irish actor Barry Fitzgerald? Do you know what he said? "When I drink water, I drink plain water. When I drink whisky, I drink whisky alone." Thank you! What are you searching for, Mr. Babu? The moon disappeared, sir. That's not something you should search outside… but in phantasm. Now… the way the "person" Babu hidden in the name Babu… is personified by you. When I see myself in the mirror, I only see my opposite. That's the case with those who see face-to-face as well. That's how you appear to me. That's because… seeing me in you, and you in me is why all of this is happening. Where's Frog, sir? Oh! She's sleeping. I am sorry to have disturbed you. Can you hear it speak to you? Can you understand what it says? You told your memories. Now tell me your dreams. I can't remember anything. The termites of time aren't satisfied by just eating our corpse. So they gobble up our stories and manuscripts… and all the hidden papers and burp it out! As though that wasn't enough… they've started to eat our dreams as well. How can they eat that? An unplucked fruit has worms inside it, right? It's the similar case. Others may not believe that you have grown a tail. But I believe you! Your tail and dreams are connected. You were a horse in your previous life. What are you saying? This tail has grown to remind you of that. So? Why would a tail grow? You've wanted to turn into a horse. That's why the tail has grown. And now in a few days, you'll turn into a horse! Earlier you used to sit up straight, right? -Now you sit hunched, right? -Yes. Yes, Grandma. Now, your hands and legs will shrivel up… and turn into a horse entirely! What do I do now? What if her words were to come true? I used to walk straight. Now I walk with a hunch. I don't know if others can see this tail or not… but… the tail has indeed grown. I won't turn into a horse. Why would you say such a thing? You mad dog! How dare you do that! Get out! -Useless fellow! -How can you say that? Lunatic! Good-for-nothing! Get out! Come this way again and I'll cut your tail off. Shit-eater! If it is true that a tail has grown, my prophecy will come true. Such a beautiful horse! How does this horse not have a tail? This horse is so beautiful. But it doesn't have a tail. What happened to its tail? I lost something in my memory, and am searching for it in dreams. Excuse me. What was my question? I asked why there's no tail. And you're saying something completely random. I just said I'm searching for my lost memories in my dreams. Maybe… this could be a hybrid horse. Is this a hybrid horse? Hey, who are you? How did you enter my house? Who said this is your house? How could this house be only yours? I've been here for ages. Get out of my house! I just told you. How could this house be only yours? The rat that preys at night, the cat that hunts them, the moth that circles the light, the lizard that eats them, the cockroach that comes seeking novelties, the spider that casts its net and makes a home in the nooks… all these lives have been living here a long time before you came along. Yeah. I… I've seen all of these before… but… I've never seen you. You have just seen the world behind mirages. That's why you can see me. Why does your ear look so grotesque? You all are the cause for that. Us? My name is Vaanavil. People call me Van Gogh. That's me. I announce the joy of rain to people. When it rains, thunder and lightning scare you. It is I who shows that there's nothing to fear. That rain makes the earth colorful. I express this through the seven vibgyor colours. Only if I hear the sound of rain will I arrive. But now the trees and mountains have all been destroyed. One of my ears got burnt because of global warming and pollution. Even now I'm listening to you with only one ear. Who's there? I came to see Professor Stuart Koteeswaran. Who are you? I am one of his old students. Did you study in the school where he taught for six months? What did you see in him that you've come this far? For 20 years, he's been scribbling numbers everywhere in the name of Maths research, and talking to himself like a lunatic. All this while I've been running the house. Who's there? It's one of your student. Who? Freud. Someone called Freud! Freud? I never had a student called Freud. I remember all my students' names. Okay, send him down. Go on. Sir, remove the lens and look! Saravanan. How did you find your way here? My name isn't Saravanan, sir. It's Freud. Freud? Hey, your name is Saravanan. I remembered only after I returned from the bank that day. This is my problem, sir. For a while now, everyone's been saying this. Didn't you say that Math has the solution to everything? That's why I came to see you. What are you saying? When did I say that Math has a solution to everything? Sir, you said every problem in the world has a solution in Math! Yes. Every problem in the world has a solution but-- Hey! Come this way. If you're able to identify the problem, then Maths will have the solution. Maths isn't what you think it to be. There's an entire illusion theory running inside it. All deemed me unfit for society and ostracized me just because I said this. That's not right. There's only one thing I can do. I'm… I'm going to create a new world. Maths will be the only language there. What? Why are you squirming? That's my problem, sir. That's why I came to see you. No, thanks. Is there a solution for my dream in Maths, sir? I saw a horse in the dream. The horse was so beautiful. Everything was fine until I went behind… and saw that the horse had no tail! I was confused. So, I asked this girl who was around as to why such a beautiful horse had no tail. And she threw a tomato at me! I suddenly woke up. Okay. What's the problem here? I told you the horse didn't have a tail, right? When I woke up, that tail had grown for me, sir. Every time I think, it keeps thrashing about. That's why I'm squirming so much. Where? There's no tail! Sir! A tail's grown on my back, sir! Others may not believe you. But I believe you. Maths is… an illusion theory! The psychology of dreams is also an illusion theory! You won't understand all this. What you've got is… an illusion theory. If you find out what your tail is… you'll reach eternity. You know what eternity is, right? An endless world! I didn't understand any of this, sir. It's simple. Where do numbers begin? It begins with one! Really? Okay. Where do they end? Sir… it goes on and on. How far does it go? It goes beyond what the eyes can see, sir! It keeps increasing. It keeps going on and on. What does that mean? Maths has no end. We don't know where it begins or ends. If you understand this, you can see everything. Has it arrived? Has what arrived? Your dream has arrived inside this. Your dream has arrived in Maths! You drew it, sir! We have arrived at a solution to your dream problem. What solution has arrived? The horse is here. Well, yes, sir… but you drew it! So what if I drew it? Has it arrived or not? Yes, sir. But I don't see a tail. If you'd connected it with that number "two" the tail would have appeared as well. "Two" is all the way over there! A horse's tail should be like this. How can it connect there? A horse's tail should be here! This is your dream! As per Darwin's theory, humans evolved from monkeys. We grew hands, legs and even a face. But what about the tail? Yes, sir. As per Darwin's theory we should've gotten the tail, right? Where did the tail go? We got hands and legs with the help of evolution but not the tail. What does everyone say when children are too naughty at home? "Too much of a tail." When they get too naughty… they say "Cut the tail clean". Why? They could have said anything else, right? The tail is an illusion. Maths is also an illusion. Your subconscious is the tail. You talk in riddles, sir. The horse is a symbol of sex. How is the horse a symbol of sex? Have you seen that Tamil song video that goes "Hold me, hold me." Yes, I have. Why is there a horse neighing in that song for no reason? Yes, sir! A horse is a symbol of sex! In a way, it's a symbol for a girl. The girl is the horse. That's why it's standing there. Have you seen a horse's tail closely? A falling cascade of hair. It's like the hair of a beautiful girl. So… the horse is a symbol… for a girl you have forgotten in your life. She's waiting for you somewhere. And through this dream… she's reminding you of her in the form of a horse. Have you read the book Interpretation of Dreams? Yes, sir. What does it say? Everything in real life comes to you in the form of symbols in dreams. Correct? Yes, sir. The tail that's grown… Your desire for that girl has grown out as a tail! I soar through the sky without wings I become a poem with no words But there's no girl in my life, sir! Hey. Think again! I'm sure there's someone! Maybe this tail is a sign that you should go look for her. I come by myself I give without asking Why are you singing now? No, sir. There's no girl in my life, sir. You've forgotten your own name! How would you remember the girl? Hey. Someone is calling you… to an eternal world. If you figure it out, you can solve anything. Are you mad? Who's that? Who are you? I met Mr. Babu. He said he could see me as Mr. Babu. He kept a conch to my ear and asked me to listen. I could hear the waves. I tried to separate the words from that noise-- His life was the three knots of matrimony around my neck. But now those knots have come undone. I have become a colorless rainbow Sorry! Sorry. Forgive me if I said something wrong! When your memories wash over me I blossom everywhere When did you see my dead father? My mother had finally started to forget him. But then you mentioned him and she's miserable again. She's crying! I just saw him! How could he be dead? We've just realized the "him in me" and "me in him" theory. You bloody asshole. What the fuck do you think about yourself? Because of you, my mother is crying. Why do you always look at normal things so intently? I'm looking at the world that runs within me. How? I don't understand. "The whole can be seen in its parts." I finally understand what Siddha is saying. Water flows beneath the earth's skin. Blood flows under the human skin. Just like the mountains and trees support the earth, bones and nerves support the human frame. Just like the ocean breathes the waves in and out, human lungs breathe air in and out. When the earth opens its eyes, it becomes green and colorful. Only when humans open their eyes, will the world seem colorful. Where did Van Gogh go? I don't know, you mongrel! Did she tell me? Or did I tell her? I need to speak to her about that. You piece of shit! My mother is weeping! Look at her crying! Can you hear her? One second! Have you looked at a candle? Look at it! You can see the sunset in it. I'll bring a compass and stab you to death! I have the compass that killed Pinky. I'll bring a needle and stitch your mouth shut. I will kill you! Bastard! I will kill you! I will kill you! She has the compass that killed Pinky. She'll kill me with it. I open myself when the sun smiles I let go of myself in the raindrops Rivers from the past Might break down barriers Reality of the dreams Might seek answers in the wind I become the hills that stretch I become the seed that sprouts Roots might search for me And the wind might turn into a cyclone Grandma. There's a big forest MGR won the elections here, right? Did he come to your house often? Apparently he used to eat here. They said he used to talk to you freely. MGR! Grandma, MGR! When villains like Nambiar return, MGR will return as well. I saw myself in him, and he saw himself in me. That's what I told her. Why would she kill me for that? The mind is the cause for everything. Is the demon's head hanging from the building next door? That doll is to ward off the evil eye. No, that's no doll. It's a demon's head. A demon? In the war between the Pandavas and Kauravas, a demon fought bravely for the Kauravas. Lord Krishna appeared and asked for his head as a boon. The demon offered it to Lord Krishna, and said… "I'll give my head but I want to witness the war till its end." Then, they went to the tallest mountain and planted his head there. He's still watching the war in the form of the evil-eye doll. The war is still going on. The mind is the cause for everything. Hello! Is it Mr. Varuna Sidhar? Live long and prosper. I saw your number on TV. Are you Mr. Varuna Sidhar? Live long and prosper. Sir, I heard you interpret the significance of lizard falling on humans, crow droppings and dreams, that's why-- Can you come at 4:30 p.m.? Okay, sir. Oh, our guardian angel! Our leader! Oh, my dearest! My leader has disappeared! Hold me, hold me! Hold my body tight, baby Which is the spot Where you feel most pleasure? Oh, I've found it I have found it, girl Live long and prosper! Live long and prosper! What are you looking at? Look over here. What's happening? You're digging your ears, scratching and, constantly tossing about. Just say, "Live long and prosper." All the problems in the world will come to end. If I say, "Live long and prosper", will I stop hearing this symphony? "Om" and symphony are merging! What? Merging? Yeah. Okay, sit. Come. All your problems will get solved. Live long and prosper. Give me your horoscope. Sir! When there's a tongue sticking out… isn't that a symbol for suicide? This demon, and Goddess Kali always have their tongues sticking out. Give me your horoscope. I sneezed even on that day. A thousand legged centipede… I saw it move. My mother's tongue was sticking out… and she was hanging on the noose. Oh, was it a dream? This was no dream. This is real. Then tell what the dream was. The dream is stuck somewhere in memory. Give me your horoscope, please! Sir… could you please turn off that sound? What? Turn off the mantra? Get out! Get out! What did you think? That's my mantra! Get out of here! Dogshit! Mad dog! I remember the dream now! A brown horse was grazing. The horse's legs were white! Like it had socks on with shoes. MGR was petting it and went behind-- What? MGR? Why is the horse's tail missing? I'm talking to you. The horse is so beautiful but it has no tail. Where is the tail? I lost something in my memory and am searching for it in dreams. She randomly said that and threw a tomato at MGR's face! Then I woke up. Then I saw that the horse's tail had grown on me! See? There's no tail! Memory must have swallowed the dream. You have to separate the dream from memory. Sit down. Are you angry? Why should I get angry? Watch it. I'm trying but… But I'm not able to… If you feel a gap in your body's sensations due to weakness, then Musli-Prash is for you! The complete solution to all your sexual problems. Well, are you satisfied? What a player you are! Only if we play Cupid's game do you accept us as men. Super Musli-Prash. Super Musli-Prash. What did you see in this? A man and a woman are trying to have sex. I know that. What else do you see? Next to that, there's a box of pills. Forget about the box! Something related to you is running! What's that? A horse is running! What is a horse? I don't know. You don't know what a horse is? The horse is a sex symbol. Are you talking about that? I know that! I thought you'd say something else. You said MGR came in your dream. MGR represents you. You mentioned a hybrid horse, right? Hybrid means gene recombination. Gene recombination means becoming a woman. Hybridization in you means you're turning into a woman from within. This means your penis will twist and fall off. That's what this dream means. What are you saying, sir? Will I become a eunuch? Yes, that's why your wedding is getting delayed! You're 38 now, right? At this age, you're still not married because of erectile dysfunction. You desire every woman you lay eyes on. But you can't do anything about it. No. You've got it wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. -Aren't you one? -No! No. Wrong! I'm not wrong. You are that! You scum! Do you dare to hit me! Get out. Out! You devil! Mongrel! Give me my money. Get out! Get out, you mongrel! Out! Could "eunuch" signify a persona without lust? According to the professor… a forgotten girl… a childhood affair can only be love without lust. That bird outside the window must be flying in that same spot now. I got burnt! That same bird… it's still flying out there now. God caused him to die for a hundred years… then raised him up and asked, "How long have you been here?" "A day or part of a day", he replied. QURAN 2:261 VIA BORGES TRANSLATED BY BRAMMARAJAN Things were different back then. Back then there were mountains stuck to the village. The sun would rise from the mountains and set in the mountains. When the sun rose over the mountains, the villages got abundant rainfall. The water was free to flow. But when the man touched the mountains and the rains stopped. The sun got angry and ran to the skies. When it got angry, the ozone got punctured and the rains stopped. The navel and the spider are one. The spider, perched on its intricate web, waits for the prey. And so does the navel. A human's first creation is the navel. Like the web has convoluted weaves, the human body has clusters of nerves. Like the linear weaves on the web are the bones supporting the body. All that touches the center of the web, become the spider's prey… much like the food that touches our body's center, the navel. You came to fetch water, but left the pot behind, sister! Here you go. Shameless! You useless woman! Who will ever respect me again? Don't hit my sister, father! Stop lamenting first thing in the morning! All this is happening because of you! She's just standing there like she's stone deaf! Can't you speak? Son, let her go. Let go! This is not her fault. All this has already been written in the manuscripts. Who are we? A dynasty of soothsayers! Fool! Even incarnations like Jesus were conceived through dreams. Look how arrogant she is! You didn't raise her right! I wonder who she slept with! She is just like you! Not everyone is like you. Abandoning the family to be with the mistress! I'll slap you! That was my past! Why bring it up now? She's pregnant and apparently the answer to it is in dreams! -Die, you wretch! -Don't hurt her, father! Father, please don't hit her! Tell me who you slept with! I'll get you married to him! You can't figure out whose child it is, right? I'm leaving. This is wrong. I can't be here any longer. I'm leaving. Where are you going? There's no place for me where a soothsayer's words aren't heeded. I am leaving. -Where would you go? Please stop! -I am going. Don't cry. Even I feel like crying. My father has bought candy. Come, let's go eat it. Die, you bitch! My love, my lord! We can't bear hunger! This crazy woman lives only for you. Why have you left me alone, and left, my dearest? Even if it pains your heart, I thought you will forgive your son! You have abandoned me with no warning! When you spoke, the whole village was under your spell. Mother! Come inside and eat. My son has now struck my dearest. He'd be lying somewhere in the forest. He'll come back. Stop blabbering and eat. Who do I have left in this world? Without food or water you roam the forests. Father, that girl is eating with her left hand. Father, she's eating with the wrong hand! What do you care which hand she eats with? My dearest! My Lord! Is she awake? Did she eat anything? She is giving us the silent treatment. He'll be fine. You eat. Are you going to eat or not, Mother? It's been 15 days since she came here, but she doesn't speak to anyone. Come, let's try speaking to her. What's your name? -Ramu. What about you? -Neeli! You're cheating! How long will you keep the same name? I kept my favorite name. Isn't that what we agreed on? Neeli fell into the well, grew wings and flew away! I want to fly into the sky as well. What's your name? Irusaayi. Is that a God's name? No, it's the name of a place. A place? Where is it? That's what I'm searching for. Where did you lose it? I lost something in my memory, and am searching for it in dreams. I don't understand, sister. I ate with my right hand, but it looked different to you. Why are you always looking at the mountains? If we climb the mountains, we can touch the sky. If we climb the mountains, can we touch the sky? How's that possible? Do you see that mountain over there? Isn't the sky stuck to it? Oh, yes! Neeli, she's lying! She's just bluffing. I came here to climb the mountain and touch the sky. How can you touch the sky? You can't touch it! If you climb that mountain, you can. But there's a catch. When humans try to touch it, the mountain moves further away. How can mountains move? She's lying! Why don't you climb the mountain and try touching the sky? Do you see that beech tree over there? The sky is just behind that tree. Let's go touch it! It's right here. She's been lying all this time! We sent her to school to study, but instead she got pregnant. And now she's had a miscarriage as well. So humiliating! She was with me all day yesterday. I even comforted her when she was tossing in her sleep. I'm sure she was home the whole time. She never left home. I don't know how she managed to do it. I don't know what's happening. How did this happen? Did you do it out of fear? -Tell me! -Open your mouth! Speak up! Why is all this happening to me? The old man's words have come true! Everything is already written. She slept with someone in her dreams… so she delivered the baby in her dreams! Her swollen belly is proof that she slept with someone in her dreams. Listen to me. This is just like a dream that gets stuck in the memory. The old man disappeared somewhere! Why don't you get lost as well? Weaving stories all the time! Do you know why this village is called Yaazhi Mandapam? During the Chola rule… they made up the creature Yaazhi… and would battle with it in their dreams. What do you think of yourself? We belong to a caste of soothsayers, who interpret dreams. It's not right for us to speak like this. Have you gone mad, Mother? This is not the time or place! Who will marry her now? Yes, that girl was telling the truth. The mountain is indeed moving further and further away. So, we can't touch the mountain? Father must be looking for us. Let's go. Someone's going to get it today. Child! Coming, Mom! Hey, come here. Your sister died and you weren't even here! You dog! Ever since this girl came here, he's been running around with her. Where did she go? Where did she disappear now? This is a miracle! She just disappeared, like an illusion. That girl came from a dream. She vanished as soon as she woke up. Oh, stop that, Mother! You'll drive me crazy. Everyone's weaving stories. Ramu, we are going to watch MGR's film again. Will you come? Get lost! As if there isn't enough to mourn here. I'll come there and spank you! Stay away! She has spoilt you. You're always roaming around! Your sister died and you were out gallivanting! You dog! Why are you behaving like this? Why don't you listen to us? Can you please fetch water from the well? Please get it. I'm going to the Radio tree. Fetch me some water, please. No, sister loiters as a ghost near the well. I won't go! There are no ghosts there. I'll give you money for sweets. Hurry up! There are ghosts, granny! I won't go. I'll take the money though. My darling, haven't I told you the story? Those who fall in the well turn into Neeli, grow wings and fly away? -Then how can there be ghosts? -Oh, yes. Take your friend and go, child… Granny! Neeli? Neeli? Neeli? We saw an MGR film yesterday! Here! Come, let's go to the well and fetch some water. I won't come! It is said that those who go there, will vomit blood and die! Hasn't your father told you the story? Those who fall in the well, they turn into Neeli and fly away! Yes! Isn't that why you call yourself Neeli? Yes. Then let's go! Guess how many stones do I have? Two in this hand, one in the other. Didn't you see the ghost near the well? Hasn't your father told you Neeli's story? Those who fall inside the well turn into Neeli, grow wings and fly away! But didn't we see his sister's corpse, covered in sores where fish had bitten her? They're lying. No, we don't believe you. His sister grew wings and flew away! Why didn't you jump and fly away then? We'll jump! We will grow wings and fly away! We're going to jump tomorrow. If you jump, you'll die! Tomorrow, you and I will jump together. You and I will go over there and get married. Don't talk to these guys. Oh! These two are going to get married! To a dog, a bone has more value than a pearl. Neeli, my foot! Chinnasami! Ayyadurai! Our leader is no more! Everyone, come! What? The "revolutionary leader" is dead! It can't be true. What? MGR died? But I saw him on the screen only yesterday. Everyone's going to the Radio tree. Come, let's go. The man who was so generous our revolutionary leader, MGR passed away at his residence in Ramavaram due to cardiac arrest. His body is kept at his residence for the public to pay their final respects. Tamil Nadu is immersed in grief. They are lying on the radio! We saw him yesterday on the screen. Don't cry! -Old lady! Keep quiet. -He even sang and danced. How could he have died? They're lying on the radio. Shut up! If you say anything more I'll cut your tongue off! Yeah! Even we saw the film yesterday. How could MGR be dead? Yeah, even I saw the film yesterday. MGR was singing and dancing and fighting on screen. How could he be dead? Yeah! Even I saw. MGR didn't die. These people are jobless. They are blabbering some rubbish. Oh, leader! They're believing the lady on the radio and weeping! To pay final respects to MGR Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, is coming by chartered flight. How could MGR have died? Maybe he fell in our well, grew wings and flew away? They've got it all wrong. Neeli? Neeli! Yes, MGR's cap and glasses are right here! See! Even the bullet that was struck in his throat is now in this glass. After growing wings and flying, he must've screamed in happiness and this must've been in the way, so he must've coughed it out! Yeah! Okay, come. Let's go down. Wait here. I will go ahead. Follow me. Let's also grow wings and fly away! Of course! If we wear that cap and glasses, even we'll grow wings, and fly above the sky! Come, let's get it. Why does it keep going further away? Maybe it isn't our time yet, that's why it's going away. The sun has gone down. That's why it won't come. Let's come back tomorrow and see if our time has come. My father will get worried. Let's go home. -Will we grow wings tomorrow? -We'll even fly! It's getting late. Let's go home. Father would get worried. Oh, tender spring That shows its face in a wavy mirage The mirage that recedes into The distance with every step The soul here stands Taking pain as its shape Should the high skies be Searched for a glimpse of you alive? To divide the lands, the heart shrinks I survived, recite the dead people The dead people What's your name today? -Ramu. Yours? -Neeli! You're cheating! How long will you keep the same name? I kept my favorite name. Isn't that what we agreed on? Neeli fell into the well, grew wings and flew away! I want to fly into the sky as well. No one should mourn this death. Oh, God! It was jouissance that caused this death. She died because she felt intolerable happiness. Her nerves have popped from sheer joy. This is how saints attain nirvana. One in a million people get this good fortune. There was a girl in my life as well. We were going to fly away and be happy. Yes. Is all this real or a phantasm? He said he'll come… but he still hasn't. Perhaps his father gave him some work. Who are you? It's me you were waiting for. No, you're lying. He doesn't look like you. You're big, like a buffalo! He will be here now. But your tail is pretty. He said he'll come, but he still hasn't come. Perhaps his father gave him some work. He said he'll come, but he still hasn't come. Perhaps his father gave him some work. He said he'll come, but he still hasn't come. Perhaps his father gave him some work. He said he'll come, but he still hasn't come. Perhaps his father gave him some work. He said he'll come, but he still hasn't come. Perhaps his father gave him some work. He said he'll come, but he still hasn't come. Perhaps his father gave him some work. He said he'll come, but he still hasn't come. Perhaps his father gave him some work. He said he'll come, but he still hasn't come. Her age will not accept me now. He said he'll come-- What is it? Why have you come unannounced now? You're always acting weird. If you have nothing-- Killing someone with syringes isn't something a thug or a thief would do. He must have done it himself. So, you're saying it's suicide. Two hundred syringes? All by himself? ATTACK IN AN APARTMENT. OLD MAN LEFT BLEEDING DUE TO TWO HUNDRED SYRINGES. The cop who closed the case was better than you. You're a fake detective! Sorry. Hear me out. I didn't mean "him". I meant the "him within him". "Him within him"? Do you still mean suicide? Leave before I throw you out. No. It's not just that. Hear me out completely. When I say "him" I don't mean him. I mean his reflection. You sound like an idiot! Get this straight. By reflection, I don't mean your husband. Are you saying he killed my husband? Yes! How is it stuck in the same place? The other day, the moon was moving when I saw it. I saw it so clearly! Do you hear it speak to you? Can you understand what it says? You just said reflection, now you're saying something else. I am correct. Your husband's name was Babu, right? What is the connection between Babu's murder and this man? I made this connection based on what he said to you the other day. Me. Babu had come. He said he could see me in the name "Babu". He kept a conch to my ear and asked me to listen. I could hear the waves. I tried to separate the words from that noise-- So? How does that make him a murderer? Are you crazy? According to Jacques Lacan's concept of the mirror stage, when a child sees a mirror for the first time, its psyche sees its reflection as someone just like itself, but which can survive destruction. So when two entities face each other, one will kill the other. So, that's my basis. He came here as Babu and left because you cried. The two of them had referential mania. That's why they listened to the conch and felt the same things. You don't get to decide my name! How-- Loneliness is so cruel. Have you grown a tail? The tail is your subconscious. If you find out what your tail is-- The mind is the cause for everything. With my imagination, I'm able to stop the moon from moving. Similarly, I can construct my childhood from my thoughts. Should I be stick with the dream? Or should I lose myself in the memories? To glow with color? Glimmer in the dark Get lost in the mirage Or stay in the present? And blossom in My flawed existence You are here! I was scared that you'd never come. Father had given me some work. Can we pull it now? Come, let's try to pull it. What's your name today? Freud. Your name? My name is always Neeli. I am always Neeli. How I wish to Liberate my thoughts Do I surrender myself to you? Or open my wings wide To fly like a bird?
