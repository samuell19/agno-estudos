Drop me a line" What? Spit it out already. Recess is over. Are you... ...messing around with Koume? Maybe. What's it to you? It's nothing. I just know her family well. Huh? Just old friends? Bullshit. You like airheads like her? I always knew you were a jerk. Your face makes me sick, sneering at everybody. Scumbag! You provoking me? Did you know this? She's got two moles on her left ass cheek. You sure? Skipping class and assault before the champs? Did you fuck Koume? Maybe. But she wanted too much. I sucked her clit and fingered her... ...and she got dripping wet... Huh? Kashima? Don't tell me... ...you got a boner? Don't... ...come to school till you heal. Don't go near Koume. Push me too far, and you'll be a dead man walking. Fuck you, hick. Want a worse life than your brother? A big wave swept him away? It was really suicide, right? I heard the older students talk. A little ribbing and he killed himself... You cocksuckers killed him. Hit me if you want. That's how you all think. I think I'll rip out your guts and show ‘em to the world. Don't look away, fucker. Okay. I'll smash your nose in. Why, Kashima?! Before such a big game. What about your teammates? Explain yourself! Sir, you're wrong. I tripped over myself, and Kashima helped me. Right? W-Well... After all, you're nothing without baseball and your buddies, so why would a zero like you hurt me?! I'm fucking sick of you! "From Misaki: Okay, Koume! The 24th" During your summer holidays, take good care of yourselves, During your summer holidays, take good care of yourselves, so you can start the new term well. Handout time. You gave me a shock. I never got to give you this. “Victory charm” What the hell. You came here to torture me? Koume won't come. I didn't ask. Don't be a baby, chimp. Shut up. Piss off, dumbass! High school has baseball too! So, when we graduate, wanna form a comedy duo? Um, are you used to doing stuff like this? I've never been out with boys, so I don't know what to do... Actually, this is... kind of embarrassing for me too. Great! It's not just me. Hey! Koume, Kanae, you ready? Come, come! Come, come! "Your material's weak. Are you really ISO?" "This us my late brother's account, and now I'm running it instead of him.” "ISO died? That's too bad. But why are you...” Koume, have you got your eyes on Misaki? | Koume, have you got your eyes on Misaki? Well, it's hard to explain. I don't know... I know that feeling. He's older, but kinda childish. Yeah yeah, he is. You got it, you got it. "He killed himself." He was three years older, with weak legs, He was three years older, with weak legs, so he often ended up skipping school. Severe bullying in junior high made my parents move us out of Tokyo, but from high school, he became a shut-in again. Even So, it wasn't his personality. I shared a room with him, but we never fought, and got along like friends. Still, he died. Let's party! . Let's party! Cheers! He died on September 15th, my birthday. He died on September 15th, my birthday. What was the significance of that? His will was saved on his computer, but I deleted it. but I deleted it. My parents were hurt enough. Police treated it as an accident. If his tweets had stopped, he would've ceased to exist, and that scared me. But maybe it’s time to stop. But maybe it's time to stop. Bullying drove him to suicide. Bullying drove him to suicide. Whatever their reasons, I'll never forgive his tormentors. I'll never forgive their indifference. I'll never forgive their indifference. Hey, you okay? This is the girls' restroom. Yeah yeah. Wanna toke? It'll make you feel good. What is that? Huh? It's like tobacco. Why not? It's no big deal. You wanted this too, right? Come on, let's kiss. Yeah? No! Don't! Don't... Don't! Oh. Okay, suck me off. You know, you did it before. That was a really shitty blowjob though... Come on, do it. Come on! Stop it! Shut up! Get with the program. I'm sorry.

My real holiday starts now! You seem kinda down. I'm not. I'm fine. That's alright then. Hey. I think I like Kashima. You knew? Sorry. I had no idea. You guys always got on well, so I thought I should tell you. You didn't have to. I didn't want to hide it from you. I feel much better! It was bugging me for so long. Keiko... It's a good match. Hope it works out. Why are you here? Hey. Say something, dammit! I was just on my way home. Don't bullshit me. That makes no sense! What? Why? Go home. Go on, go home. Go the fuck home! I went out with Misaki, but I got drunk and he nearly kissed me. He was smoking something. Marijuana, I think? I left before he made me do it. So what? You want sympathy? Or praise? What a joke! You came to tell me that? Got no real friends? Then die! You've got no friends! You die! I'll be dead this time next month. Pathetic. You keep saying that. Yeah, I'm a narcissist. What now? Don't touch me! Don't touch me! What the fuck?! Hey! Don't touch me. What's your problem, slut?! I came to see you! You look... ...cutest in the moment when you cum. Hey Isobe. No matter how much we do it, I feel like something's missing. Why? I don't care. Wait... That's not it... This is dirty... I don't care. No... When we were in Year 1, why did you ask me out? Back then, you were... ...little... ... low-key... ...and earnest-looking. I wanted to be your friend. Sorry I'm like this. It makes me sad. What makes me sad is, eventually you'll easily forget about today... ...fall in love with some other jerk... ...and have sex like a virgin. I saw you shit yourself, dammit. I don't get you. You act like a bimbo when it sults you. Guys grimace and pump away, which makes you feel superior to them. You love feeling dominated and weak. It turns you on like crazy. What's your point? Basically, you're self-centered. That's exactly... how I'd describe you. I hate who you are... ...but I hate myself more. I hate rain too. It hurts, like I’m drowning. I don't deserve to have sex. I swear to God every time that I'll stop... ...out God's not there. I end up doing it again, and wishing I'd drop dead. But I've decided. I'm gonna end this. This life. Who do you like? Nobody? Kind people. If something's weighing you down, you can tell me everything. If you feel lonely... I'll stay with you. I don't mind if you die, but... ....don't want you to say you will. Sorry I'm so self-centered. Huh? You'll do the costume contest? It's all couples. Who wants to see bro dude dopes doing cosplay? To be honest, if me and Kashima enter, we'll win. My sense of humor'll give dopes... ...watery eyes! What? Nothing. Move. I can't get past. I did nothing wrong. Yeah, you're right. It was all my fault. Sorry I hit you. "To Isobe:, Haven't seen you for a month. Coming to the festival???" Hey Koume. The typhoon'll hit your festival. Mom I want you to buy me something. What? What's this? A CD? Yeah. "I'm at a pool bar. Somebody come take me on. I'm invincible :)" Super shot! Yeah! Right there! No way! There goes my pachinko money! Shut up. It's closing time now... Wait! One shot to end it. Dear lsobe, Sorry about this letter. Sorry about this letter. I thought a message wouldn't be enough, so I decided to write. It's been over six months since we started talking. A lot has happened and it seems like we're growing apart, which makes me feel lonely and it seems like we're growing apart, which makes me feel lonely. Shithead! Let's go. I don't wanna walk home. Okay, maybe I'll call Doi. Good idea! Hands off, jackass! You said you like kind people, so I want to try to become a kind person. so I want to try to become a kind persen. I want to be with you forever. Hey, walk straight. Where's Yunohara? Yunohara! Hey! Mama! Huh? Just writing this makes my heart throb with so much pain. I don't want to think I'll never see you again. I don't want to think I'll never see you again. Hey, what the fuck? What's this stuff? Huh? Dunno. He's a herb collector, so... Who are you? Somebody sent you? Too many enemies to know Mari, call the cops. You cool with them searching your bag? Mari, forget it. I called them already. Okay, alright alright. Drop that weapon and let's handle this like men. Oh yeah? Fine with me. You dumb fuck! I love you, Isobe. I love you, Isobe. I always wanted to tell you. "Happy Birthday. Here's that Happy End album you dont have. If this letter bugs you, throw it away.” It's been a year. Time to start putting away his things. You probably don't remember this. I think you were... two years old The four of us came to the seaside here once before. I took my eyes off you, and you were drowning. Then he...desperately tried to save you. He couldn't swim either. When did it start? When did our family... get like this? I'm sorry. Dad... Actually... Well! I'm sure he'd... want us to move on. Sure. "37th Ushio Festival” Hey... Is Isobe here? Isobe? He hasn't come at all since Term 2 started. Right? Thanks. What was that? The number you have called is currently out of range, or... Isobe? I'm coming in! No way... Please... Don't do this... Wow, it’s really blowing. Take care, everyone. Let's play a song. A request from Year 3 Group 3 student, Koume Sato. “Gather the Wind" by Happy End. On the edge of town Down a stretching alleyway I walked along Through a blotchy haze A streetcar rising trom its slumber Could be seen crossing over the sea So I guess I'll Gather the wind Gather the wind Gather the wind I want to dash across the blue sky The blue sky The rising sun at daybreak Looked oh so beautiful When I reached the other side I looked beyond A deserted breakwater A city flying scarlet sails A city flying scarlet sails Could be seen anchored in the bay So I... Isobe! Arent you cold? Thank you for this. Listen! Listen! Keiko kissed Kashima! Oh my god! Whoa, Keiko! Shut up! I didn't! Koume! Let's go! Keiko, I'm sorry! Wait up! Keiko, I'm sorry! Wait up! Why? Why what? You look well. Weird hair though. Oh. Thanks. You're back at school now? You were away so long. Who cares? I was just away sick. Liar. You've been gone all this time. You were in my room? Forget it. I don't care. Oh yeah? I really do hate this town. Hey. You studying lately? Yeah. I am. So I can stay with Keiko. Oh. I gotta study too. Huh? I'll aim for Meiin High. It's far, but they've got a dorm. Huh? Why? Dorm life's impossible for you. The other day, I met her. The girl on the shore. From those photos you deleted. I was so nervous, but we exchanged contact details. It was crazy! So unlike me. She's a Meiin sophomore. One year ahead of me, but that's cool. It can't have been her. How can you know without the photos? Sorry! I already made sure it's her. Heard of backups? That's not it... I meant, no matter how hard you try, it'll never work out for you! Maybe so, but... I'd be dumb to pass up the chance. That's not it... You said no high school for you. That you'd die. So die! You wanted me to? Don't be so glib. Don't be so glib. Why? What about your brother's curse?! That doesn't exist. It's not right... You scare me. You changed too much. I don't want to see you... enjoying yourself so much. I've always loved you, Isobe. But when I realized. I didn't know what to do.... What became of us. And you coming to hate me is all my fault, I know, but... Even so, I still love you. I can't help wanting to be with you! I'll try hard! To become a kind person! So please, stay with me. Sorry. Doing that now just wouldn't be right. And I don't hate you. I think we can probably be normal friends now. I know you're lying... What can I say then? Just... Would you mind kissing me? Just once. Then I'll forget everything. Then I'll forget everything. Really? I'd better not. No more letting you mess with me. No. No... Isobe! Don't go! Isobe! Koume! Study hard! Isobe! Keisuke Isobe, correct? Sorry. Got a minute? An incident at a billiards bar. Sure. I'm so hungry. Let's go eat meat! Where's Keiko? Don't know. Koume, where's Keiko? I told you she's at cram school. Oh, you did. Isn't she going to a school for comedians too? Like, pick one. Why do you always listen to old songs? Huh? Hey, that Group 5 guy! - It's him! - The geeky one. But hey, that guy Otsu is such a babe... But hey, that guy Otsu is such a babe... I know! Hey, what about next month's party? Of course I'll go! I'm going! You too, Koume? Huh? I don't know. Going together'll be more fun. “Fortune” "Half-blessing” You didn't tell them? No, only Keiko so far. Timing's difficult. Koume, do you feel like you're my girlfriend? Huh? Do I feel like it? Well, anyway Otsu, why do you like me? Because, you know old bands and manga and stuff. Shared interests matter. Oh? You mean you like my interests? Of course, I like everything about you. Hey. Sometime, take me to your hometown. Huh? You'd just get bored. It's a nothing town. But it's near the sea. That's plenty. Only a crappy beach though. But I used to like walking on that beach, looking for things. Wet fireworks, kelp... I never found what I hoped for. So you shouldn't put much hope in me. I'll only let you down. I've found something. Huh? YOU. Yeah. Best not to say that. Let's go. Oh, by the way, what's that camera like? Wanna see? It's really great. "Insert card" Huh? Isn't it time you let me kiss you? I'm...pretty desperate for you to like me. In that case, will you promise you'll always love me? Huh? Hey! Hey! Koume! Over here! Yo. Practice over? Yeah. You? I dropped my SD card somewhere here. Important photos on it? Nah, not really. Then give up on it. Must be buried by now. You're right... How's things lately? Keiko never tells me about you. Well, it's complicated when you've been together 18 months. Oh. Really? Yeah. Hey, Koume. You got a boyfriend now? I've got one. No kidding. You know... I might make the national champs. As a manager. Cool, huh? That's so cool! I thought being manager sucked at first. Then an ace pitcher joined, and it got fun. I really envy you. Actually, I like baseball better now, as weird as that sounds. So you should... ...take your time looking till you find something like that. Oh... You listening? I've found it. Something much bigger. Wow, it's so cold! Dumbass! The sea!
