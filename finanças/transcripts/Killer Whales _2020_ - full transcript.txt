Earth. A special planet. And the home to so much life. Birds, turtles and golden retrievers. Nice people, small people, and weird people alike. Los Angeles, California. Four million people. Entertainment capital of the world. Some of the wealthiest people on Earth. But not everyone has a place to sleep. 50,000 homeless people line the streets of L.A. It's a crisis. Gentrification squeezes its grip on once affordable neighborhoods. Many are desperate for homes. Housing hunters must show teeth to win good deals. On the brink of homelessness, some do shocking things to secure an apartment. But commit murder? One year ago, renowned artist David Hackneyed was killed during his apartment open house. His body was found face down, drowning in a bathtub of blood. The murder weapon? The wounds suggest a butter knife. The crime remains unsolved. Four desperate apartment hunters were present at the open house that morning. The first is a fun and quirky priest who goes by T-Dale. The second, a spirit medium named Klara O'Sho. The third, an eccentric senior citizen named Dizzy Daisy. And finally, a goth, medieval role-player, who goes by Squire Naljaimon. They are the suspects. I'm Donny Wunder, and I want to find out who killed David Hackneyed, and answer the question: did housing desperation lead to a murder in Los Angeles? Come along with me as I interview the suspects and dive in headfirst. You're watching my documentary, and it's called... Killer Whales. You have no idea how much paperwork I had to fill out to get them to let me leave my house for an hour. Are we rolling? Hi, I'm Donny Wunder. In 2019, I set out on an artistic journey. Are you rolling? Action! I made a documentary about the murder -of artist David Hackneyed. -David! ...to be this year's most bizarre murder case. It had the potential to be a great film, in the spirit of timeless classics such as The Jinx, The Makings of a Murderer or The Staircase. -Millions of dollars. -But the dopes at the studio got their hands on my film and they made a mess of it. They destroyed my movie and I got tangled up in this. And I'm the butt of the joke. Killer Whales was always a big joke on Donny, and eventually the ding dong caught on. To save face and explain himself, Donny asked to do a director's commentary on our cut of the film. So, we figured-- - Here's the juice-- - Jesus, fuck! You-- you asked-- But you asked-- No! Tune in to the flow of the space. We let Donny do his director's commentary. What you are about to see is my attempt to take back my movie. I'm going to say exactly where the studio went wrong, and you're going to hear my side of the story. You're about to see Killer Whales as I saw it. -Thank you. -Enjoy. Tragically murdered. So, who was David Hackneyed? Visceral. Um, all encompassing. Entangled and, um, codependent. Next. Twice voted Bad Boy Artist of the Year, David was a notorious drug hound. You know, Jesus was fit, too. If you look at almost any picture of Jesus Christ, he's extremely shredded. Look at that. Hypodermic needles. I used to do a lot of heroin. That shit will kill you. There we go. There we go. That's it. That's fucking it. But David was considered a revolutionary within the contemporary art world, pioneering a style of painting he termed "Climax." I call these little circle jerks. Just like when you're a kid, you know? It's innocent, you know? It's what kids do. The tongue touches down on the body. That's when the quivers come. Quivers and the moans. This art can never be stolen. They can do a fucking D.N.A. test, they're gonna know it's me, because that's it. You sexy baby. Oh, yeah. Feels kind of good, huh? Yeah. You like that? You like that? I am David! It was the story of a lifetime. So, I made a pitch video, and it found its way into the hands of a major studio. Hey, camera rolling. Action. Hello, Hollywood Studios. My name is Donny Wunder, and I have the pitch of a lifetime for you. I don't watch pitch videos. They're fucking torture. But my assistant Jenny watched it, thought it was funny. I watched it, and I took on this project immediately. Studios, I've never made a movie before in my entire life, but I was called to make this movie. It's like there's a tiger in my chest that's like, "Ah, Donny, make this movie. Yes! You have one life, Donny." And I intend to answer his call. This train is going, and I invite you to sit next to me. And guess what? I'm a pretty good passenger to sit next to. And no, I've never made a documentary before in my life, but I've seen a whole lot. Carl Sagan? I watched Cosmos. How hard can it be? I wanted to see this guy try to make a movie. So, Francis is going to be here any second, as I said, and I am pinching myself. Um, I can't hardly wait and, um... Excuse me, I'm looking for this café. You know, Francis has been in a little bit of hot water recently, uh, in the press. Are you, um, Francis? Francis Falconi? And, you know, and who hasn't in many ways. And-- and someday when I'm in hot water with the press, I'm going to want to be treated just like I was before the bad press. And so I'm going to try and do that. He, I think, has a style that could really be nice to sort of, um, mentor me as an artist. I'm envisioning a good, uh, mentorship duo. Uh, something along the lines of, you know, Samuel Beckett had James Joyce. Uh, T.S. Eliot had Pound. -Francis. -Hi. Hi, Donny. Donny. Donny. Donny Wunder. Nice to meet you. How are you? -Uh, nice to meet you. -Oh, God. I don't want to be in this fucking town. I don't know how the fuck you live in it. It's disgusting. The people fucking suck. -Yeah, yeah. -Whatever. What do we got over here? Uh, what have I been doing since Killer Whales? Um, well, now I direct Christian values Hallmark Movies. Yeah. I didn't read the script. Okay, there isn't-- there isn't a script-- I didn't have to, though, because the fucking title was brilliant. -Did you write that? -Yes, "Killer Whales." Come on. It's great. It's great. Yes. That's my title. Thank you. Thank you! Every Hero's Journey has its mentor. Luke had Obi-Wan, Harry had Hagrid, and, uh, Donny had Francis. I want you to do your thing. I want you to make it beautiful. I want you to make it gorgeous. That's what I fucking do. I know. And-- and bring your art to this thing. -Yeah. -And, uh-- When you say "this thing," you're-- you're-- It's like a cat and mouse. I don't understand. -Yeah. Yeah. The-- the movie. -Really. Yeah. Um, we are making a movie about trying to figure out who killed David Hackneyed, the artist. Right. So, David is a real... -he's a real person. -Well-- well he was. I thought I was clear on the phone that we were making a documentary. And that was-- that was my fault. Bonnie? Yeah. Oh, no, I'm here. 7Yeah, yeah, I'm here. I made it. Life is great. Thank you. Uh, quick question for you, what the fuck project is this? Yeah. What do I mean? I'll tell you what I mean. I mean in a fucking boho chic, stupid ass fucking cafe in North Hollywood with some fucking Poindexter telling him what he should've-- He sounds like he's, oh, making a fucking documentary? Oh, are you fucking-- I don't make fucking documentaries, I make fucking films. This is a fucking joke. Tell me this is a joke. This is a fucking joke? Holy shit. He looks like a fucking child. He's wearing a fucking turtleneck. Sweating my fucking dick off over here, he's wearing a fucking turtleneck. This is a fucking joke. This is a fucking joke. The, um, the way I-- I treated Donny on the set of Killer Whales... I was a very different man back then. So, this is your chair here. Here. Um, I'm going to get you... -Okay. -Okay. How are you feeling? -I feel fine. -Okay. You good? I said, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Okay. All right. And, uh, what's the sound? I know we have a little bit of... Okay, so, this is your-- these are your questions. Okay. Okay, that's fine. And, um, you know, I know he's going to be... We don't want to scare him away. Um, we want to find out if he killed-- I know how to ask questions. I know. I've done this. Okay, okay, so, we'll be-- we'll be good. I think if I put a stool or a chair right here, And-- and if you ask him, then maybe I can ask him. Why would I have you right next to me? Well, I just think if I'm kind of shadowing you and we could-- -You want to shadow me? -collaborate on that. Why don't you shadow me the fuck over there? -Why don't you do that? -Okay. Here, shadow this. -Why don't you go get that? -Okay. Go get that. And just stay over there. -Can I get you anything? -No. You want a cigarette, or... Just get the fuck out. So, Francis interviews the suspects. Donny... well, he didn't really want Donny doing anything. I think the line he used for Donny was... You don't get to lay a finger on expensive toys like cinema cameras until your fucking balls drop. And I will check when that time comes. Or something. Lord, we thank you so much for bringing Francis in here today. Lord, we ask that you give him blades like you gave me to ride off into the sunset with you forever. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, let's get this on and poppin'. People say to me: Donny, you-- you got kicked off your own movie set. And I say no, no, no, no, no, no. I was called elsewhere to do other work. So, while Francis was conducting the interviews, I had to take the first steps on my Hero's Journey, which was to raise money for the side investigations. Okay, this is where I ask for $10,000. Um, I am standing in front of Ryan Silver's office. He is a family friend and a very successful vitamin business man. Um. I am believing. Positive thinking. I'm going to go in there and ask for what I want, and I'm going to take it. So, here we go. Yeah, we could have funded the whole movie but we thought, eh, let's see how this idiot goes about raising $10,000. The thing about money is, if you believe that it comes to you easily and without effort, it does. That's manifestation. Yes? - Hi, Ryan. - Oh, hello. Donny Wunder. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Donny. Shoes. - Oh. - Thanks. - Sorry. - No, it's okay. -And Ryan, I have-- -We just keep everything very, like, sacred and intentional and focused here. -Okay, yeah. Sacred. -Hi. I have a camera crew with me if that's okay. Of course. Yes, yes. Um, just, sir. Sir. If you could just take your shoes off as well. that would be... great. You can just put them over-- As you see the, um, the handmade boots? What do you see? I-- I see peace. Mm-hm. What else? - Calm. - Mm-hm. What else? - Rocks. - Do you see the abyss? Yes. All that is, is possibility. Right. And I want to... Speaking of-- Just back to the-- back to the... -Oh, I'm sorry. -We should do this. - Okay. - Yeah. Um, speaking of, um, the possibility... - That is really nice. - Can I say something? - Just off the bat? - Yeah. Yeah. It just seems like you've got a lot of... - tension. - Tension. Yeah, you've walked into this room with a lot of tension, and I want to make sure you're absolutely primed and... -just relaxed. -Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. Have you ever heard of Beta Brain? - Beta Brain? - Beta Brain. - Uh, no. I like-- - I think it might really help you. Yeah. Beta Brain is-- So, I am, if you want to just get a shot of this? I'm on a whole raft of, uh, cognitive enhancers. Oh, a raft. Wow. Yeah, I mean, there's-- there's lecithin, -there's, uh, Ginko "Balboa" -Um... They sell all this stuff on my website. - Okay. - Yeah, so, I-- I, um, if you... - I'll find... yeah. - Just-- Yeah. Uh... - I'm just going to-- - In terms of the project... - Yeah. - We would love to have you -a part of this. -Yeah, uh, in like a kind of, in a director sort of advisory role, I would love to. I-- Here, I have some thoughts. - Wonderful. - So, your style. - Yes. - Kind of, um... - It's very auteur. - Mm. Uh... have you thought about being more professional? That's a thought we could take into consideration. Do you mean, uh... Well, no, it's just, it's very guerilla. It's very, very, very, very guerilla. I-- I guess I just mean, like, more... You seem tense again. Let's-- let's-- I... need... Let's-- let's both-- let's both actually just have some rock garden. Yes. So, waves in the rock garden and think about the waves in your own life. So, from you, Ryan, what I'm hoping for is... $10,000. Yeah. And what I like about you is that you're unafraid to ask. I'd like to read you a proverb, if I could. - Okay. - Um, it's about mistakes. "It is all right to forget your mistakes... if you remember their lessons." And, Donny, in a lot of ways this film is a mistake. Uh... Rule number one of making a movie: never, ever, ever, ever count on family coming through, because they won't. Especially not family friends. Do you think I should just let, like, keep it regular? Or do you think I should... Uh, tell us a little bit about yourself? Who are you? Well, I used to be a stockbroker on Wall Street. You know, I used to live the high life, uh... I was at all the parties, used to do a lot of the drugs, used to do a lot of the drinking and a lot of the "bad stuff--" So, you have somewhat of a-- a dark past, -is what you're saying. -I don't really remember too much of it, but, you know, I'm a good guy now. -I'm a good guy now. -I can relate. I can relate. Well, let's talk a little bit about the day. I was losing a few members to the church across the street. You-- you-- you always wear those? Oh, these are my blades. I blade for Christ. You didn't see my Instagram page? It was a typical Sunday. I was doing my sermon. Um, and I left early to make sure I got to the open house in time. Okay, so-- so you-- you bladed to the open house. Who was at the open house? Were you-- Anyone else there while you were there, or... No, no, no. I was the first person there. Okay. Okay. And what was the energy like inside? The vibe. What was going on? What did you-- what did you feel? The vibe was weird, if I'm-- if I can be real. Hello? Francis insisted that the actual suspects act in their own flashbacks, as an artistic decision. I was looking to make the reenactments interesting. Uh, cinematic. The, uh, door was unlocked, so I just let myself in if... Finding the-- the points of access and looking for the subtext and the subtleties and every little thing that makes an artist an artist. And I stand by what we did. We found it. Thank you, Jesus. Are you kidding? That's when I knew they were making a mess of my movie. Ugh... And I believe at one point, uh... a Klara showed up. Is that correct? - Oh, yeah. - Tell me about her. What is she-- what was she like? Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Um, hello. Hi, how're you doing? I'm T-Dale. How're you doing? It's nice to meet you. Yes. Namaste. You know, I don't know what she was on, but she was feeling things, she was seeing things. I mean, I got to say, like, the color schemes, the style, it's all... it's all very, you know, - avant-garde, you know? - What's your name? And not too shortly after we had, uh, correct me if I'm pronouncing this right: Dizzy? What about Dizzy? Did they arrest her? Sh. Something's coming. Is she arrested? She needs to be in jail, I'm telling you. Let's talk about her for a minute. She came in swinging knives at people. She said her credit score was like 1,000 or something like that. I'm like, "This girl is out of her mind." And you know what? I know people like that. I used to be people like that. Oh. Wow. Oh, look, we got friends. Well, I got something for you. -Oh! Oh! Hey, come on, come on. -Why don't you get out of here? Get on out. Come on. Come on. Rally it up. I'm going to shiv you. Dizzy... Look, all right? I did what I could with what I had. Dizzy looks weird as shit, and I wanted Richard Dreyfuss to play David. -I get his son, Harry. -Come on, round 'em up. -Who the fuck are you? -Well, who are you? The fuck are you doing in my house? -Oh, fuck. No, okay, the open house-- I had a listing for the open house. I don't want to do it anymore. Okay, so, bye. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Come back. -What do you mean-- -I don't wanna do it anymore. I had a-- I put an ad in, it was a passing fantasy, and now it's over. -So-- so you just lied? Or-- -No, I didn't lie. I had-- I had an experience that altered my perception-- - I need this place. - Stop talking! -I live out of my car, man! -Just stop talking! When he gave me that news, I... I don't know. I just... My heart sank. I-- I didn't know what to think. I thought-- I thought it was all over. What do you mean when you say-- That time I was living out of my vehicle. How'd that make you feel? A little uncomfortable? You know, I... don't like to admit that to everyone, but, you know, God takes you from one place to the next, right? What was your day like prior to going to the open house? Just stop talking. Hey-- hey man! -T-Dale, come on now. -Hey, Eagle. Come on, give me your hip mans right here. Come on, give me some of this. All right, I'm coming. I'm coming. Yeah, man. Oh, it feels good. Feels good, praise Jesus. And I was living, uh, next to one of my best friends, Eagle, who's living out of his car as well. Man, where are you going? -You just got here, man. -I know, I know. I'm trying to not be late for my blessing, Eagle. Your blessing? What're you talking about? I told you, man, I've got the open house, all right? God said he would give me an apartment, and I think I found the one. Aw, man. I don't know why you want to leave this place. Look at all this space we got, man. -Look at the blue sky-- -Eagle, listen, I love you, all right, but, uh, I'm butt naked under this robe and I'm about to get really even more naked, so I just need you to shift everything over there, all right? Just tell me your stories from your car, and... -All right, man. -All right, love you, Eagle! Yeah man, I just don't know why you want to get out of here. You've got to fix your values, man, because look at this-- Nah, I agree. For real. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he's a really interesting guy. He, uh, sold his house to finance his Mustang and he just lived out of that thing right next to me. I don't know why. We were in a parking lot of a Taco Bell, and that's just where he wanted to make his life. Some people come by they look at me, they say, "That's a nice car." I say, "Man, I know. I know. You don't have to tell me. I tell myself every second, every single day. They say, "What part of town you live?" I say, "I live right here, man. I live right here." You know, I think Eagle might have been, uh, a guardian angel sent to me by God, you know? I've never gotten so much wisdom from a person while simultaneously not really knowing what they're saying, you know? You know what you going to be if you get that place, man? You're going to be like a ship anchored in the harbor. And you ain't never going to feel that freedom again, man. God. Feel that music baby. So, I-- I changed in the car and, uh, and I rollerbladed from there. Don't wish me luck, wish me blessings, all right? All right. Wish you blessings? Where are you... Oh, you're going to your thing. Hey, man, what time are you going to be back? Later! You wanna listen to some tunes later? It's '80s night. I was broke. You know what I mean? They could've-- they could've had me go to a back of a-- I don't know, Costco or something like that. I would've paid rent for that at the time. Excuse me? Excuse me? - Do you guys have pork? Pork? - Pork? Yes. Do you-- What's, like, the biggest size? Do you have a whole pig? Only three pounds. Three pounds. Okay. And that's the biggest-- No full pig? No, yeah, pig, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. I let Donny fumble around town as Francis continued with the initial interviews. And boy, did this kid not disappoint. I think he was coming off a Mythbusters marathon, which was great because then things got cookin' on his forensic journey. We got a pig. Um, I contacted my friend. His name's Tanner. Runs a place called Tanner's Oink House. And, uh, apparently he's got the pig rig, uh, set up for us already. Um, and it's one of these. I think he said it's number one. So, what we're doing here is we are testing if a butter knife could pierce the skin of a pig, um, and thereby piercing the skin of David Hackneyed. So, this is the time where we tick off whether this could be the murder weapon or not. My theory is that-- Oh. It's got a look in its eye. Whoa, fuck. A surprised look. Lit it... It's lit up like a murder scene. Okay, um... We're going to see. Oh! Oh. No! No. Ugh. Ooh! It's the weakest-- Oh, fuck. Help me. Help me. It's not the butter knife. There is no way this pierces any pig skin or David Hackneyed skin, and so we're going to relay this to Francis. We're going to tell him... We're going to talk about the murder. And-- and-- and-- and please take your time with this if you have to. How did you react? I mean, how would you react? I'm supposed to go back to my car. Wow. Well, these ain't half bad. I'm still mad at you. You know, I'ma wait here until you come out. I'll just be sitting right here. All right? I ain't leaving until we sign a lease. Month to month if you got it. And then you just see Dizzy walk out with the blood on her hands and you're just like, "What did I get myself into?" You know what I mean? Um... uh, what... What's that? What is that? It's blood, honey. So, in your mind, you... you think that Dizzy did it? Oh, my God. Absolutely. Without a doubt. I saw a butt naked guy face down in the tub with blood all over the walls. It was, like, gruesome. It was like Elvis Presley meets The Red Wedding. It was just disgusting. It was terrible. It was terrifying. Just one more question and I'm going to let you get back to doing your God things. If you did it, if you murdered somebody... what would T-Dale do? Cut! I... would probably hire somebody. But that's neither here nor there. See, I-- I didn't kill her. I was in the, uh, the kitchen. Well, T-Dale first said he was asleep in bed when the murder happened, and then he said he was in the kitchen checking out the appliances. So, there's that inconsistency. It kind of makes you go... huh. I heard a scream from the other room. She was in the bathroom by herself with him. Had nothing to do with me. So I just want to put that out there. You know. God, strike me down if I'm lying. Oh, I trusted him. But I've learned that in this town, literally no one is trustworthy. And so maybe T-Dale is good guy, becomes bad guy, and kills. I was curious. So, Francis and I went on to conduct what would become known as the splatter test. What day is it? What time is it? What's going on? It's-- it's around midday. Mm. Fucking great. That's fucking pig's blood, bitch. -Is that real? -Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. All right, so where's David? What's he doing? Was he in the shower? Is he over here? David is in the bathtub. - He's in the tub? - Yeah. -Okay, get to, stay right there. -Okay. -Lay down. Lay down in the tub. -Okay. Taking a little sponge bath, you know what I mean? Hanging out. We're having a-- David's having a good time. -Yes, - He doesn't know he's gonna get fucking killed, all right? Okay. Come over here. I don't like that. I fucking hate that, actually. Spin over here. Over here. That's good. Up like that. Up like that. Taking a bubble bath, bubble bath, bubble bath, bubble bath. Boom. Right? - So, he's hanging out. - Okay. - He's hanging out. - Yeah. - It's fucking midday. - Yeah. Maybe closes his eyes. Maybe he does that. -Okay. -And then fucking boom. He's fucking done. He's done. All right? - So, I'll come up here. - Okay. - There's the shot. - Okay. There's the fucking shot, right? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. -That's the fucking scene. -That's the tension. -Because the blood... -Yeah. We're going to fucking drown you in it. Poor it in over the sides. I want it on your fucking toes, your dick, I wanna be-- No one knows. What's cut off? What the fuck happened? -Wait, you're not gonna-- -What the fuck happened? - In terms of the pig-- - What the fuck happened? Huh? A fucking murder happened, right? -That's right. That's right. -That's what fucking happened. -But in terms of the pig blood-- -That's the fucking scene. Is the pig's blood going to be on me? As a film subject, you have to be good about boundaries. You have to set boundaries or you're going to get bulldozed. It's gonna be everywhere. All over the place. So, what do you think about that? Huh? I-- I think it's incredible. I don't know-- I think I'm going to have to set a boundary before... But a great film director will cross boundaries. Will violate boundaries. Take your clothes off. I'm going to shoot this motherfucker. Okay? Good job. Good job. Boundaries. I-- I did a lot of boundary work in-- in therapy and I learned so much about them. Um, I-- I learned in particular that when an individual says no, that they mean that they don't want you to-- to-- to cross that. I didn't know that before. -How we doing, kid? -Good. -Yeah. Nervous? -Yeah. -Don't be. -Okay. Okay. -You got this. -Okay. -Close your eyes. -Okay. You know who you are? -I'm Donny Wunder. -The fuck you are. -Close your eyes. -Okay. You're-- You're David. I'm David? -David. -Okay. But here you are. Just wanted to do a little tubby time. Okay. Tubby time. Just relax. -Just a boy in the tub, right? -Mm-hm. -But guess what? -Hm? Someone wanted to murder you today. -You trust me? -Mm-hm. -Okay. -Okay. -There you are. -Mm-hm. -There you are. -Mm-hm. Your throat has just been sliced. Goodbye, David. I'm going to miss you, little buddy. Now, the splatter test was all about figuring out just what is blood like? What does blood feel like on the skin? What color is blood when it's resting in a bathtub? At what rate does blood travel through the air once it leaves your body? These are the questions that the splatter test answered. Gold. That was gold. I'm happy. I'm proud of you. All right? Hurry up. Clean this up, too, okay? We've got to go. We've got to move. Moving on! Moving on! Well, what we got from the splatter test, what we learned, was that there was a lot of blood. Like, a lot of blood. Too much. And so with that information, we went on to speak with our next suspect. I am Klara, and I see, um, spirits and, uh, can do séances and see energies. Yours is beautiful. It's like a red, beautiful, big red color. That-- That's-- I'm sorry. That's what you do? -Yes. -All right. Well, let's-- let's just go to-- Let's talk about the, uh... murder in the open house. Uh, where were you the morning of the, uh, open house? I was with my friend, Peggy. I've been waiting for you. She had taken me to this, uh, this space. I'd been there once before, but it seemed different this time. She brought me to a new room. Men-- Um, mental institution. Is that what it's called? Well, why-- I mean, how did you end up at a mental institution? Oh, uh, the first time, uh, I had had an experience with ayahuasca, which I've had many experiences with. Always... Well, almost always good. Except for this one time. I'm going to fucking kill you! Oh, yeah. She assaulted someone high on ayahuasca. Mm-hm. A bad spirit had found me and, uh, had-- had used me as a way to talk to everybody. No one ever let it talk. Yeah, I had a lot to say. Um, uh, well, let me ask, what's your relationship with-- with, uh, with Peggy Diglett? She has a beautiful soul in the middle, then it gets a little dark, then it kind of spirals a little bit. We had a really hard time tracking down this Peggy character. But sometimes as an artist, you have to step up. Hi, I'm Peggy Diglett. No. Hello, hi, I'm Peggy Diglett, I'm nurse here at the psych ward. I'm a nurse. Hi, I'm Peggy. You have to fill in that void, take a risk, and do what you have to do to make the scene work. Hi, my name is Peggy Diglett. I have worked here at the ward for five years. Hm. And what are your qualifications? Well, Francis, my qualifications are that I have been a nurse here at the ward for five years. Excuse me. It's so funny when you have patients and you try so hard to keep them steady and you try to keep them peaceful and well-behaved. And every once in a while, they make noise. And you have to-- Usually I'm there to do something about it. Would you say you're a good nurse? I can say my record speaks for itself. 99.9% of the time. Okay. Well. Let's cut to the chase. Please. Klara. - Mm. - O'Sho. What's your relationship with her? Klara is not the sweet little bunny she makes herself out to be. No, she's not doing so well. It's like a little squirrel burrowed some nuts in her brain. Some walnuts. She knew my love, Squire. She knew him first and then I met her through him. And, uh, she's become a good friend. Is that my boyfriend? Well, then why don't you come down here and find out if I am? Come pick her up. What did he say? Is he coming to get me? Oh. Are you upset that Squire Naljaimon - is with me and not with you? - Hah! I think she did it, yeah, I think it's pretty, um, one of those things that when you really think about it, it must have been. You know what, I got another name here that you might-- might ring a-- a, you know, might trigger something. Squire Naljaimon? -Where are we going with this? -Oh, you tell me. I can tell you that he's not a very good man. Though he tries very hard to seem so. I can tell you that he's not such a loyal servant. I can tell you that if you throw a stone on Sunset Avenue, you'll hit a woman that Squire Naljaimon has dated. Oh. Greetings. Salutations. That's a hell of an entrance you got there, buddy. Well, I do have a flair for the theatrics. Yeah, that's... crazy. -Uh, what-- Is that an eagle? -Oh. This is the earpiece of. It is made entirely of grouse tail feathers. -Grass feathers? -Grouse. -Grass feathers. -Grouse. -Grouse? -Grouse. Uh, in meaning the representative of the spiral, uh, when it comes energetically, uh, symbolic-wise. Great, so-- so you're Squire Naljaimon? In the flesh. And you guys are-- are-- are together? Newly married. But a fortnight. As you can see, our rings. The stones grow more powerful when they come together. So, when they touch. Um, let's-- let's talk about-- let's-- let's talk-- let's please talk about that open house. Let's get to that. What happened on the way to the open house? Let's back it up a little bit. That morning I awoke at dawn, my heart heavy with sadness, for that was the day that I had to tell my then roommate, Darren, that I was moving out. We awoke, we readied ourselves for a game of Chaucer's Dungeon. The role of a fine director is to be able to extract these performances. And that dungeon scene is a perfect example of that, where you have these vulnerable, talented actors, who have done the research, and the prepared director pulling that from them. It's fine cinema. Alas, we can only play about, uh, probably about 30, like, 45 minutes, I think. Uh, ultimately. Behold my cape of creeping darkness night. I do behold it. I bear the sign of Oxymon. Oxymon. Oxymon. Let me pass. I, am not the keeper of the keys. Therefore, I cannot let you pass. You must search for Lady Wiggledom, for she is the keeper of all keys in these parts. I must have that Thorny Key. Its icy crest must be mine. You truly must have it. It truly must be yours. Turn to the next chapter to see what happens next, Squire. This chapter is called "Jack and Wolf Go to Hell." We are reminded that the flames of bane rise to encompass all of us and our party. Encircling us in hellfire that at first seems wretched and wicked, but soon is revealed to be the-- Baron! I have to leave in an hour. Uh, uh, oh. Um, why? I have to, um, retrieve up my lady. Are you fucking kidding me? Psh, you must, ah, psh, go pick up your, ah, your girlfriend? My Lady Kracklem, please. Your lady Klara than the middle of a game. Lady Kracklem. Anyway, into the Winter Woods we go. Or perhaps the Dragon's Pass? Which is but a shortcut and would save us some-- some-- some time, so, I shall roll for the Dragon's Pass. Ah, but you rolled snake eyes. Yes, into the Winter Wood we go. We go. I encounter the Dorics. And the pawn encountering Dorics, we are reminded that we must whisper! Whispers only in the face of Dorics for their slumbers are thin. I roll to destroy the Dorics. Ah, but you roll to awaken more Dorics because you didn't whisper. I roll to board the Ship of Aranthal to enter the Narwhal Sea. For a second life. Uh, you roll to enter the Narwhal Tree in which you live fused to tree bark. You must have that thorny key, its icy crest must be yours. I must have that thorny key, its icy crest. It must be mine. Baron, why are you doing this? I don't-- We have an hour to-- to play. Let's, you know, just enjoy. I don't-- I just don't understand why you have to go pick up your girlfriend. Please refer to her as Lady Kracklem! -I will not. -That's her name. Her name is-- That is how-- What she goes by now. Klara the Cloud Corgi. That's mean. You know what, okay. My lady said you would be difficult about this. What? I cannot do this. I cannot, ah, be here all hours of the day anymore for you. How could she? How? I don't know how you can't understand this. I'm moving out. There it is. You can't move out. We're in the middle of a quest. I, um... I don't think I can look for the thorny key anymore. Methinks I must find a new key. They key to a-- This potential apartment. I bid you good day, sir. Don't worry, Sir Patrick. I'm still here. And then, I left to go retrieve my lady from that evil, poisonous place. At the end of the day, you're just another little piece in his Chaucer's Dungeon Game. Just a little pawn he's using to get to his treasure. Past the trolls, the dragons. You understand? Well, we're moving in together. I hopped in my chariot and I was off. You, uh, you own-- you own a chariot? Uh yeah, it's a hatchback. A car? Yes, it's a '93. Ah, okay. It's good. Um, so you-- you arrive at the-- at the open house-- at the apartment, and um, and what happens next? You guys both go in, or is it... My lady went in first. And I tarried behind at the threshold. Whoa. T-Dale stated that you were seeing things that he... Mm, T-Dale. T-Dale. Oh, T-Dale. He was very lost. Is it, um, maybe, were you, maybe hallucinating? Oh, hallucinating, no. Hallucinating, that's a good one. That's what-- People always say that. -Yeah. -Why do they say that? That's what we call a layman's term for those who don't truly understand. But that's okay. Um, so, okay, you, uh, he mentioned Dizzy being aggressive. Do you-- do you agree with that? Uh, she had, brought in with her a very dark spirit. She was just very vulnerable so, things get attached to vulnerability. And, uh, when she came in, she brought in something with her I did not like. Ah, and then, from there, I had a bit of a premonition. And that's the truth. Can you describe the murder? Blood. Okay, and um, , Squire, let's talk about you. Sir Squire. So you're-- you're in there and you're just-- you're out, yeah, you're-- What are you, what are you doing? -What are you doing? -I was waiting for the signal my lady was going to give me once the space had been properly cleared of all negative entities. Of which I am very empathic towards. W-- w-- That's-- It's a little odd to me if you're looking for an apartment, why-- why didn't you-- why didn't you go inside? I, uh, like I said before, ha, I was standing guard. Okay. Thank you. So the-- the murder was taking place, you must've heard something, must've saw something. I, um, I didn't hear it. I didn't see it. I-- I don't know what, uh, you, um... Right. But-- but there were screams heard. And-- and you know, people running and there's a murder, in broad daylight. So, I mean, you were right there. Perhaps there was, uh, good insulation of the space so sound could not travel. You know, that's not really clicking with me. I don't really, I don't-- I don't buy that. It's, it's, uh-- Crazy question, were your eyes open? You know what? Okay fine. Let the truth come out. Uh, yes, you know what? I happen to suffer from Type One Narcolepsy. It is not an easy thing to admit to yourself or to this camera. However, it is true. Three million people worldwide suffer silently in their sleep. Only 25%, honestly, have been correctly diagnosed. It is a difficult thing for me to speak about. And yes, my narcolepsy came over me like the cowl of night over my eyes and I descended briefly into darkness. Yes, briefly. For but a moment. And when I came to, the atrocity had occurred. I think we have everything here today. I really thank you guys for letting me into your-- your-- your thing here and, um, is there a restroom - I could use on the way out? - Yes, there is. I just have to clean the, uh, camera and-- Past the second candelabra on the right. What? Um, it's a candelabra. Candle, wha-- whe-- where? The second one to the right. Um... Fuck 'em, fuck. Okay, okay. What is a candelabra? I don't think Naljaimon did it. He was too-- Uh, what's the word? Honorable. And Klara was so clear on things. So spiritually there, that I just don't see her killing anybody. So we had to expand our reach. We had to cast a wider net and that's how we found James. We're going to have Francis sitting right there. Just ignore the camera, okay? You're gonna do great. -Gonna do great. -Okay. And which one's Francis? Francis is the one holding his hand up right there. -Hi, Francis. Oh, hey Francis. -You can see him. -Yeah. -And it's Francis? James was David's neighbor. And this interview marked the moment in my journey where the mentor said, "Come along with me. Join me." And what I mean by that is Francis let me be there in the room with him for that interview. So just relax. Just look straight ahead. Okay. And just be as honest and bright and kind as you are. And you're gonna let me...- And you're gonna let me know what to say. Okay. He doesn't like me on camera much so... Okay. And just let me know what to say. I will say anything that you want. James, do you mind if we address the, uh, elephant in the room? Oh, the eye? Well, I was unfortunately, uh, in a wreck. Uh, got hit in a head on t-bone. Wow, I'm sorry-- sorry to hear that. But then I was in the emergency room and I was just sittin' there and I just could not stop scratchin' it. And they said, "You stop scratchin' it." And I said, "Okay." But I just could not stop scratchin' it. I don't know what it was. And I woke up in the middle of the night and the next night and I was still scratchin' it. And they said, "You gotta stop scratchin' or you gonna give yourself a subconjunctival hematoma." So I put-- So they put on this, uh, stop me scratchin' it. Let's-- let's talk about-- Let's talk about David. Oh, this is the neighbor who was murdered. Could you say, that looking back now a year ago, did you foresee anything like this happening to David? Well, no. It-- it would've been December, this was. No, he was murdered. David was murdered a year ago, July 1st. Not December. No, no, no, it was-- Am I wrong? It was December. -Nope. -We didn't get a lot from James. Where were you a year ago July 1st? -Where were you, buddy? -Paris, France. Not at home? Actually, we didn't get anything at all from the James Divine interview, but what happened next with Dizzy was a real trial of a journey. That's when things got heavy. The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek. Joseph Campbell. Can I take this bag off my head? Please? Oh, you can take the bag off, sweetie. You just-- you just forget where you been. Thank you. Oh my. Look at your face. Woo! Howdy. And who are you? Well, my name is Disney Daisy. But everybody calls me Dizzy. Describe the, uh, morning of the murder. The day of. The day of the murder. Well, I was-- I woke up the usual time. I started making my cocktail. Havin' fun. Listening to music. Living a wonderful life. Then, in walks my niece, Cordelia. Hey, Aunt Dizzy. Well, fuck! Hi. It's Cordelia. Uh. Oh. I says-- Oh, they're not after me, are they? I'm sorry. I gotta take a minute here. Every siren damn near jolts my heart. They're lookin' for me. One way or another. Anyway, Cordelia comes walkin' in. I says, "There she is! Oh, look at you." Oh, it is you. Yeah. Is this a good time or? Well, how'd you get in here, honey? I own the building. You know this. Give me a kiss. That's actually what I wanted to talk to you. -No, no, um, no. -Well, just give me a kiss. Remember we had that personal space conversation? Okay, ugh. Yeah, um, all right, ah. I wanted to talk to you about this apartment and, uh, you living here, um. Well, why don't you take a seat first and I'll make you a drink? Well, I don't really have time for that and -it's ten in the morning so-- -Take a seat, take a seat. Every time I see her, I am so sweet and welcoming. Why don't you take a seat? -All right. -I'm gonna make you a drink. It's 10 AM, Diz. I don't need a drink. I just need to talk to you. Well, I can't hardly keep track of that anyway. -Are... Is this... -Why don't you take that? Cough syrup? She says, "Auntie Diz. I'm taking you out. You're a danger to yourself. You're a danger to the people in this place. You're drinkin' early. I-- I can't have you just living here like this. This is, like, it's unsafe." Why don't you come see my chicken over here? "Your chicken's dead." All that kind of stuff. No, he's just asleep. -He's not asleep, Auntie. -He's just asleep. Oh my god, Auntie Diz, that's dead. Let me show you. Let me show you. Don't touch, Auntie! Please! No, he's just sleeping. We'll wake him up. She says, I'm taking you to a home. I look at her, dead cold in the eyes, I said, "No, you're not." Dizzy, I'm not playin' anymore, okay? It's not safe for you here. You got dead animals lying around. You need to go to a home, where they can take care of you. I found a nice place. It's called Oak Manor. I'm not goin' there. I already found another place and I'm not going to tell you where it is. Then I'll drag you out. Then you're gonna have to catch me. Have you ever had your niece evict you? It doesn't happen very often. No! You get down there. You get down there. -Stop! Stop! Stay still! -You get down there. -You stop that. -Hey! What the? We run around the place a couple times, up the stairs, I lock her in the bathroom. And what happened when you arrived? When I arrived at the open house, I had scooted over. I go in, I see a pair of roller blades by the door, I say, "That's too much fun." And I look around, we've got two people there. And they are so sweet. They look like cute, little, happy people. Auntie Diz! Aw, look at you! Oh, dear. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Leopard print, are you kidding me? I would've lived in that shoe, if they let me. What did you make of T-Dale and Klara? Well, T-Dale, I thought, was a deeply, deeply handsome boy. And, uh, but he didn't like me after the knife. He said, "I don't trust you. You're a danger." He said, "You're an absolute danger" and I thought, at by that point, any sorta sweet talkin' him wasn't-- It was a dead end. Well, T-Dale says you were dangerous and Klara said you had a "bad spirit." What do you think about that? Huh, well they don't know the half of it, do they? Well, it doesn't stop there with Dizzy. You know, Dizzy's been married three times. Three gorgeous marriages. Pretty boys. And, uh, all of them have died. Um, first one, came tumblin' down a flight of stairs. His head smashed like a pumpkin at the very bottom. It spilled. It was a nasty scene. I didn't do it. Least I don't remember doin' it. I could've. I don't know. They tell me I didn't. It was an accident. Second one, well he wanted to-- he wanted a proper Christian burial, but I got him cremated 'cause he wasn't very good to me. Third one, third one died, and we were just walkin' over a bridge. We were walkin' right over a bridge in New York. What do they call that one? The Washington Bridge. I said, "Honey, it's so, it looks so nice out here." And he said, "You're always walkin', you're always tryin' to walk right away from me. Why don't you walk right next to me? You're too-- You're lookin' around when you should be lookin' at me." And next thing I knew, he's flyin' off that bridge. Next thing I knew, he's tumblin' wooooo, you know. Like a train goin' through a tunnel. Woo. That's the last I saw of him. Except at the memorial service. Hard to cry when they hur-- when they treat you so bad. Um, why did you go to the bathroom? I understand you went to the bathroom at some point. I could damn-- damn near, couldn't keep anything left in my stomach, so I had to go to the bathroom to drain it. Music's blarin'. I can't hear a thing. I know David's in there. Uh, but I don't look for him. I can't... damn near, can't remember where exactly he was. I wash my hands in the sink. Splish, splash. Get 'em all wet. Wash 'em up. I go to dry my hands, I can't find a towel. I think I see one. I was later told, "No, Dizzy, that wasn't a towel. That was his bloody shirt." All right. Well, what happened afterwards? I leave. Come out. I look, I say, "Hello honeys." They're lookin' at me like I'm some kinda Halloween monster you buy at the-- the party store down the street. Well, fuck. And that's when T-Dale come, go walkin' in the bathroom. He see the dead body and David. He go, "Uh, you killed this man." "I knew there was somethin' wrong with you. Waving that knife around." Do you-- do you have an idea of why maybe the cops might've thought you did it? Well, I'm guilty of a whole laundry list of things, honey. Murder might be one of them. But I didn't kill David. For me, let's backtrack a second here. You have a history of some dead husbands. Yeah, sure. -You go to an open house-- -Yeah. Of an apartment you're obsessed with, right? You're escaping another place of living. Uh, you walk in, you pull out a-- you pull out a knife. -Yes, I do. -You wave it around. I wave it right round like a game. Right? You threaten people. And then you black out and you walk out with blood on your hands. I'm mean, I-- I-- it, you br-- You, do you see why you are a prime suspect in this case? Well, look at you. You some kinda lawyer? Building a case against me? The other ones couldn't-- couldn't finish the job. They couldn't lock me up. Did you murder David? Did you murder David? Are you guilty of murdering Da... Incoming! Oh, what the fuck are you doing? -Dizzy, I got your Robitussin. -Ah. Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? Right now, you wanna walk in front of the rolling camera? Well, he's going to blow his dick. This is your movie. This is your movie that you're fucking up! What happened was, I was instructed by both Dizzy and Francis to keep the bag on my head the whole time. They said don't ever take it off. And Dizzy asked me to deliver her Robitussin. And so I'm following instructions. But I found myself in the line of fire. You can go back to Idaho and make films about barnyard fucking animals! For all I care, 'cause you are fucking done. Well, you... You hear me? You are fucking done! I will bury you! I am a fucking filmmaker! And I know, just having been on film sets, I know that anger and film director go hand-in-hand like brother and sister. Where the fuck are we? Huh? You bring us in a fucking dungeon? Playing games? Where the fuck are we? How about that? Where are we? Where are we? You should see me. You should see me when I'm mad. Because when I'm mad it is, Wow, it's scary. I have been working on this film for three fucking weeks! Three weeks! Sometimes when I'm freaking out on set, I'll go, I'll go, "Screw you, jackass!" Heh! And everyone will go, "Whoa! Who said that?" And-- and, they'll look to the director. And I'll be-- I'll be so upset. You go off, you go off. You want your skittles? Go get 'em! -You go off, you go off. -Go get 'em. Honey, you get worse. You ruin your film. -Fuck you! -You ruin your little film. Fuck everybody! Fuck it! I'm outta here. I dare you, I dare you to fuck me. I left the film. And, that broke the court order. And I had to do a month in prison. And that was rock bottom. Um, therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away. Behold, new is come. Corinthians 5:17. Heard the film went to shit too after I left, so... huh. Little victories, yeah. Francis took off this morning. Um, and he left us with the bill, which is going to put us in the hole. Ah, there's no easy way to say that, um. But Francis really did what any good mentor does, and that's that he led me to myself. He left me to come to understand that this is my movie and that I'm ready. Donny, you're ready to make this movie. You're ready to finish it. And that's invaluable. That's priceless. And so, thank you, Francis Falconi, for showing me that I'm ready. Thank you. We're gonna do it. I called Donny to apply a little pressure. I went to film school. USC. Fight on! - Chelsea, hey. - Don, hey. Now, we need those deliverables. Okay? - Oh. - We need footage. Oh. Well... that's... Donny, I'm, fuck it, I'm gonna pull the goddamn plug. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Don't pull the plug. Donny, don't pull the plug. We are so-- Shut the fuck up. You know what success is? Success is something you murder. Stir the pot a little bit. Right, well, the case is almost closed. I'm not going to call you again. So, we'll de-- we'll get those results and we'll deliver those to you. - Don't fuck with me. - Right. - Do not fuck with me. - Okay, all right. - Go away. Bye. - Okay. Bye bye. I am-- I'm having an anxiety attack. I quit. I'm-- This is done. Stop. Ugh. I think he handles his stress in a very healthy way. Ah, laying out and taking in the sun. Seeing his family. And his anxiety, if he has anxiety, is... You get the sense he's not holding too much of it. And that it's, that it's all out there. And yet, he's so very calm. It's inspiring. And, ah, I think, the stress I'm feeling now, and the anxiety I'm feeling now doesn't mean anything in his world. Ah, because he's not carrying it. He's carrying something but I-- I don't have to know what that is. And to know that he doesn't know about Francis or the money problems or any of that, I find that very calming. So this has been special to have some time with my friend. And so it was back to square one. I am so proud of myself for not giving up my journey. I'm so proud of myself for not quitting. Only through death, can the hero be reborn. And through resurrection comes a greater insight. And ultimately, a path forward. I mean, it was beyond what I thought this guy was fucking capable of. Who had-- who had the acrylic nail? Oh my god! It was her! It was her? Are you rolling? Are you rolling? A nail in the tub. An acrylic nail in the tub. She did it. She did it. It was her the whole time. Ahhh. Okay. You can't really see it, but right there, that is an acrylic nail. She did it. Oh my god. Oh my god! Oh my god. It was her the whole time. You know, you can, you can say what you want to say about the film. But, you know, I give it to Donny for that ending. I mean, I couldn't, couldn't have written something that good if I tried. I have, but you know, for this, I mean. Just when you're at the bottom, something special lands on your doorstep. And what I hold here is the bit of evidence that has led me to the murderer. David Hackneyed's death will find justice today. I am soon to call Peggy Diglet, who was wearing an acrylic nail when she killed David Hackneyed. This nail wound up in the drain of a bathtub. I saw it in a photograph. This is an exciting moment. I'm going to call her. I'm going to confront her. And we are going to lead her to justice. Stay tuned. And that's where the studio really fucked me. It's kind of funny. None of this, would have happened. Peggy nail. None of us could've been prepared for Donny's big deception. Look, I did what I had to do. And if you think that documentaries are all facts, are all truth, are nothing but reality, maybe shine the mirror on yourself. Think again. We could play pretend. Is that legal? It's a movie. It's my movie. Donny had to die that day. And Donny... was born. We can put this on Peggy. And that would get out, get us out of this. "Don't ever let facts get in the way of a good story." Mark Twain. By the way, I'm a narrative filmmaker now. Hi, Peggy. - Peggy Diglet. - Jesus. Donny Wunder here. I'm on your tail. Well, well. Okay, Donny! I mean that I have found an acrylic nail in a photograph. And the acrylic nail, I happen to know, b-- belongs to you. And we need to bring about justice. And you need to be returned... to where you belong which is in the hands of custody. And we need that right away. Uh, documentaries, oh come on man, documentaries are bullshit, okay? Narratives. Narratives. That's cinema. That's film. Truth and fact. And narrative. Truth to whom? If my truth is my truth and it's not your truth. What is truth and who's the, who-- who knows that there's any objective truth anyway? Do you have any idea what it's like to have something taken from you? Someone you love? When I let Klara go, I felt something in me say, "Follow her." You're fucking moving in together. You're moving in together, you're fucking kidding me. Maybe it's Peggy's turn to go bonkers. Maybe Peggy's going a little bonkers. A little nutso now. It's your turn. Go. I couldn't stop myself. And I saw Squire fall asleep like he does. Because of his narcolepsy. I thought, "I'm just going to look inside." I just wanted to take a look inside the house. It's never been ab-- about the truth. Truth is bullshit. You want some truth. Huh? Go fuck yourself. How 'bout that? That's some truth. And I climbed down and I slipped. Urgh! Ow! And that's when he grabbed me. He grabbed my neck. Do you have any idea what it's like to be in a bathtub-- Okay, Peggy. And have someone grab your neck? I just wanted to get him off me. The only thing I had was that nail file, or I would've died. Ah! Can there be a truth? Can truth even exist, when you really think about it? I don't think so. Urgh. Oh! It was self-defence. It wasn't... It was never the plan. It was never the plan! The way I see something and the way you see something is different. The way I see an orange is different from the way you might see an orange, which might look more like an apple to you. When I saw the blood, when I saw all the blood, I got spooked. And I had to go. And so, I ran. I'm sorry. I am sorry! But you're never going to find me! Never! No, Peggy, Peggy, please. Peggy, please. -I didn't ask for any of this. -We need you back. Goodbye. Come on, Peggy. No, don't this. Don't do this, Peggy. - We need you back now, please. - Goodbye, Donny. Oh, come on, Peggy. - Goodbye, Donny. - Peggy! Peggy, Peggy! Well, Peggy is on the loose. And, ah, we are going to have to hunt her down. We are going to need to find her. And cut! Cut. Oh! And that's the nature of truth. It's different for everyone. So my loyalty to truth in a documentary, I don't have to be truthful. Because my truth wouldn't be your truth anyway. Yeah, unbelievable. You know, despite, the-- the courts and the-- the prisons and the, all this bullshit and-- and whatever, I'm proud of that kid. Yeah, I said it. I'm proud of Donny. And you guys can go fuck yourselves. You fucking frauds. Screw you. I am tired. Okay. Let's, uh, ring it in. Okay, thank you. Hold! LAPD recruits. Move out! Does that make any sense?
