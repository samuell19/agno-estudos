(Black Maiden) (Black Maiden Chapter Q) The girl's broken. Broken? Where has this come from, principal? I said she's broken! She doesn't talk. Is it a problem with her health? No, Miss Mei is perfectly healthy. However... she has a certain shy side to her. Listen, you can hear her. What a lovely voice. But she hasn't spoken a word since she came to this convent. Just a moment. Principal, what's the matter with you? We've finally found people willing to be her foster parents! Please, don't worry. As it says in her documents... Miss Mei has painful memories from her infancy. She just... She just shuts herself off a little, that's all. Yes, that makes her all the more welcome, right? Yes, we want to save children like that. Thanks to the support of many people, I was able to find great success in business. I want to give back to society. Both of us can't have children easily. But for as much as we can't have children, we want to give that love to an unhappy child. What do you think, Miss Mei? It's a no. I can tell. Isn't that right, Mei? One, two, three. Again. Again. Again. Again. Again. Go. Naoko! Will you behave? Mei-chan must feel shy being stared at so much. But I'm so happy! This lovely pretty girl has become our daughter. I know, but there's such a thing as too much, you know. Right, Mei-chan? Mei-chan, this is your home from now on. Get out now. We're here. Well? It's a nice house, isn't it? It's lovely inside! It's lovely! The bath's big too. And there are two toilets. Go in. Go ahead. Wait. Rana-chan! What are you up to in the dark? Come over here. Rana-chan's shy too. That's right! We hadn't mentioned. Yes, you said you were going to! That's why I kept quiet. I'm sorry! This is Rana-chan. She got here yesterday. Rana-chan lost her parents too and was in a home like you, Mei-chan. Oh, yeah! I didn't tell Rana-chan either! This is Mei-chan. Mei is 17 like you, Rana-chan. Two's more fun than one, right? From now on, you're both our daughters, so shall we stop using chan? Alright! It's Rana and Mei from now on. And you're sisters now! Be friends! Now, don't be shy. Eat up! I made soba especially to celebrate you two moving in. Want any, Rana? Oh, yeah. When you're talking to us, don't hesitate to call us mom and dad. I prefer mama and papa. Either's fine. No! It has to be mama and papa. Alright. Mama and papa it is, then. I'll show you around the house later. Hey, darling, will you do that thing? That thing? You mean the storehouse? No! That thing. Here. There's 500,000 yen in each. Use it to buy things you need for school and life. Tell us as soon as you run out. Oh, also, about the storehouse I just mentioned, we use it to stow things away, so there's no light or places to stand. So make sure you don't go anywhere near it. It's dangerous. Mei. Mei? Mei? Oh, yeah! Here. Hey, darling. Hey. Oh, I can't remember! Hey! -That thing! What was it? -What? What was it? Die! Murderers! Piss off! Die, die, die! Die, die! Piss off! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Murderers! She's a crazy lady who lives nearby. She sometimes does that to ease her stress. I feel sorry for her. Why? I just do. You just do? Die! -Get out of here! -What's funny? You're strange. Die! Die! Die! I'm not the strange one. You murderers! Is that a nightingale I hear singing? Bolero? That was Bolero wasn't it? Bolero Maurice Ravel. Digalto Symphony Orchestra. I bought it with the money I got. I was desperate to have it. I won the manga in an auction. It's upside-down. Nibelungen. It's upside-down. It's the same box. And the books. You're right, it was upside-down. Is this the Matsumoto Leiji version? I wanted that but someone outbid me. Mei? I also... wanted... the Satonaka Machiko version. I did. What a coincidence! Have you liked Maurice Ravel for a long time? Before my mom died, she listened to Bolero a lot. I think she dreamed of being a ballerina. I first heard Bolero when I saw Sylvie Guillem dancing on TV. I couldn't stop crying when I saw her dance. I also dreamed of being a ballerina like your mom... but you can see how my foot is. A limited edition Flash Frame T-shirt? Yeah. I have the same one! No way! We're similar, aren't we? Maybe we're not just sisters, but twins. When is your birthday? 六月 June. Not the sixth? Freaky! This is weird, me too! Freaky. It's cool, though, isn't it? Did you buy those together? We both have them by coincidence, right? You're a good match! Well, it should be ready now. Not yet! One more minute. Okay. Nobody makes a better chankonabe stew than Naoko! I hope you like it. Are there any foods you two don't like? No, but I'm allergic to kiwi fruit. Naoko, please tell me there's no kiwi fruit in the stew. -Of course not! -No. -Thank you for the meal. -Yes. It's yummy. How's yours, Mei? Yummy. That's good to hear! It was worth the extra effort. Wait a minute! That's the first time Mei's spoken! So it is! I didn't think you'd talk again. She talked a lot in her room earlier too, right? She talked again! Alright, she's not a baby. I'm happy anyway! What's up, Naoko? It's because Mei spoke! And these two are getting along so well. Yes. We're blessed, aren't we? And we're going to make... you two even more happy. Let's eat. -Eat, eat. -Thank you! Slow down, it's hot! What's the matter, Mei? Nothing. Go on, tuck in. I started cooking yesterday. I'd expect no less from you. Rana, Mei! Smile! -Look this way and smile. -This way! Put your faces through more. -More. You too, Mei. -Perfect. That's good! Very cute! -It is cute. -Right! -Closer to the gorilla. -Go on. -Keep going! -Imagine it's me. -Imagine it's Papa! -Why? It's me! Come on. -Mei! -Mei, over here! -Look at the camera! -Here! -Rana! -Rana! Rana! Adorable! -Rana! -Are you okay? Oh, watch out! Be careful! There you are. Coochy-coo! Look at me! So cute! Mei! Rana! Over here! Look at me, Rana. -Look at me, Mei. -So pretty! -Mei! Mei! -One with Mama. -Naoko! Naoko! Wait! -What? -Quickly! Quickly! Come on! -What is it? -Okay. -Hey! -Papa! -Sorry to keep you waiting! Okay! Come on, that's it! -Yeah! -Calm down a bit! Ta-da! -That looks great! -Voila! -It looks delicious! -As great as always! There's this too. It looks yummy! What's this? Mochi? I bet it is mochi! It's not mochi! What's up, Mei-chan? I'll pour your drink. -Oh, the tea. -Here you go. -Okay. -There. -Okay. -Okay. Here's some tea. -Thank you for the meal! -Thank you for the meal! -Tuck in! -This looks great! It looks yummy. -How is it? -Delicious! Naoko's gyoza are the best! It's because I used lots of garlic today. Garlic? Lots of garlic? I don't believe it! Delicious! I love lots of garlic. -Rana? -What's tasty? -It's tasty. -What's tasty? What's tasty? -They're the best! -Eat up, there's plenty more. -There's more? -Yes, there is! I made 100 today. Really? You made that many? Yes, you've all got healthy appetites. We do! Lots of garlic! Can I sleep in here? Are you happy, Mei-chan? I suppose so. You suppose? I've never felt happy before... so I can't really tell if I am happy, to be honest. I'm... really happy that I got to meet you, Mei-chan. Me too. I'm glad I got to meet you, Rana-chan. That's nice. Do you want me to tell you a special secret? What? We're going to die. What do you mean? Here. This is a simulation of what would happen if an asteroid with a 400-kilometer diameter hit Earth. Humans and all other life... would be instantly wiped out. It would be terrible. Neither NASA nor the government have announced it... but a few years from now, there's apparently a possibility an asteroid will hit Earth. Which means we only have... a short amount of time left. I see. Aren't you scared, Mei-chan? If we're all going to die together, it can't be helped. It can't be helped? I do like you, Mei. And... from now on, shall we sleep in one of our beds every night? I'm happy with that... but I... Die! Die, die, die! Die, die, die! Die, die, die, die! Well, we'll die when the asteroid hits. Die, die, die! -That's true. -Die! Die! Die, die, die! Murderers! -Murderers! -Shall we go to sleep? -Let's go to sleep. -Die, die, die! -All of you, die! -Good night. Piss off, piss off, piss off, piss off! Piss off! Piss off! Piss off! Die! Murderers! What does this mean? I never even imagined that your business... could fail! You've only just got here... so this is very painful for me to say. But now... we won't be able to look after you two anymore. But what will they do? Fortunately... we won't have to give up the house and I was able to save some of the assets. But, and this is truly hard to say... we should be able... to look after... just one of you. So... you're sending one of them back to the home? We can't do something so cruel! I know! However... However, while the chances are slim... if the deal I'm negotiating just goes well, it'll work out. I'll have an answer one week from now. When we have dinner on that day... I'd like... to consult with you again based on the news. However... I'm really sorry... but I'd like you to prepare for the worst. Die, die, die, die, die! Die, all of you! Die, die, die, die! All of you, die! Die, die! Did you break it? Of course not! I treasured it! Besides, it wasn't even kept in this room. You won't know what happened, will you, girls? I didn't even know it existed. Me neither. It's fine. Anyway, hurry up and get dressed for school. It is not fine! I remembered my mother by it. You didn't scratch it yourself? No. Thinking about it... that scratch wasn't there when we went out yesterday. Mei... you went out early this morning, didn't you? I... I went to the shop to get a notebook. Couldn't you have bought one on the way to school? Alright, both of you hurry up and go to school, yeah? Goodbye. Take care. See you later. Who did this? Did they have to do it when we have no money, of all times? It was like this when I woke up this morning. These things don't just break. I'll check if the hospital has any spares now. Thanks. These things don't just break. These things don't just break. These things don't just break. Rana-chan! Rana-chan! Rana-chan! What? It was you, wasn't it? What was me? You just pushed me with your crutch! What do you mean? It's tomorrow, isn't it? I wonder who they'll pick. Mei-chan. Sorry to wake you. Come here a minute. I went to the toilet... and I could hear them talking. But they became friends quicker than expected this time. We'll have to pick kids who won't get along so well next time. It's no fun. I'll make it all the more fun for you! I told you, it's that day of the month. Shall we put them away? Both of them? Put them away? At this rate... we're both going to be sent back to the homes. They're not human. They're devils, those two! Who are you? What's the matter? Nothing. I'm sorry for doubting you before, Mei-chan. I should say that. I'm really sorry. But if you can't do it, I'll do it by myself. I don't want my happy life with you to be ruined by those two. Rana-chan... I'll do it. With you. I'm sure you know... but at dinner tonight, I'm going to reveal the result. No matter who gets chosen, I don't want you to resent one another. We're responsible for everything. And it's a greedy request... but regardless of the result... I want you two to keep fostering your friendship. We both struggled to death coming to our decision. Please understand that. I'm going to make that beef stew you both loved today. So please don't get home late. Right. Let's eat. Pass these around. Rana-chan. Did you go somewhere last night? Yeah. I was preparing for today. Preparing for today? You get home first today, Mei-chan. I'll ask them to pick me up because my foot hurts. Then Kenichiro should come to get me in the car. You get Naoko alone and I'll get Kenichiro when he picks me up. What are they? Snake venom. How'd you get something like that? Follow me. I tested to see how strong it is. It died almost instantly. These have 10 times more venom in. Let's both do our best, yeah? Yeah, Mei-chan? We told her to get home early. Maybe she's had an accident? She's got a bad foot. Oh, it's Rana. Hello. Okay. Right, I see. Alright. Yes. What is it? -She's at the station. -The station? -Are you picking her up? -Yeah. I'll take her. I won't take her. One, two, three. Again. Again. Again. -Mei? -Again. -Mei? Where are you? -Again. Again. Again. Again. Rana! Rana! Hi. Right, get in. Go on, get in. Okay, I'm going to close the door. (Kenichiro suddenly decided we'd all go together) (Well, the plan's failed then) (What should we do?) (But doing it is our only option) (What? How?) (Asteroid) What's the matter? What's up? Rana? Does your foot hurt? Are you injured? Asteroid! Asteroid? Where? What have you done, Rana? Are you okay? -Mei-chan! -Are you okay? Rana-chan! Mei-chan! Mei-chan! That should be enough. Even I'll be able to cover them up with soil. You rest in the house, Mei-chan. Will you be okay? Leave it to me. Well... if you insist. Die, die, die! Die, die, die! Murderers! Murderers! Die, die, die! Die, die, die! Murderers! Murderers! Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die! Die! Die! Die, die! Die, die, die, die! Die, die! Die, die, die, die, die! Die, die! Morning. Morning. It's the beef stew she made yesterday. Yeah. I didn't want it to go to waste. There you are. Let's eat! Yeah. Thank you for the meal. It's yummy. Are you alright, Mei-chan? Is it really okay now? Is what? Now we've put them away. It couldn't be helped. It couldn't be helped? After all... we would've been sent back to the homes by them otherwise! You didn't want to go back, did you, Mei-chan? I know I didn't. It's fine! I told Uda's company that the two of them were traveling abroad for a while. A lie like that is sure to be exposed. Look at this. They had nearly one billion yen saved up! Why don't we use it to go abroad or something? Hey, where are you going? The bathroom. I go to the police. I don't go to the police. One, two, three. I'm going to the police. It really is fine. Hey, Rana-chan. What? Let's confess. We'll definitely be found out! Anyway, we're children, so we won't be executed. If we properly explain what they did surely... Surely what? You think they'll find us not guilty? Hey, Rana-chan! Rana-chan! Hey, Rana-chan! What's that? Mei-chan. It's time to open your eyes. Even if we testify about their cruel tricks, we don't have any evidence! We murdered the kind parents who adopted us and took their money! We're depraved slayers! You're the one who has to open your eyes, Rana-chan. I can't bear this anymore! You can't -bear what? -Any of this! What are you doing? Hey! -What are you doing? -Police, please! What are you doing? Hey. What's that? What is that thing? We'll save the world! You and I! We'll save the world! Mei-chan! Stop it! Come on! Let's be happy together! Let go! Let go! This is all your fault! I... I didn't want to slay them! It's a bit late for that! This is all my fault? You said we should slay them too, Mei-chan! I wasn't myself! You regret it. Slaying them. Of course I do! If I knew I'd feel this way... I would have rather gone back to the home! So you're not right, after all. I thought... this would work with you, Mei-chan. What? How are you alive? No! Let me go! No! Let go of me! No! No! No! No! No! No! Open it! Hey! Why are you doing this? Hey! You're not alone in there. Make friends. Rana-chan. Hey, Rana-chan! 站住 Hey! Hey! Help me! Hey! Open the door! Hey! Who are you? Hasegawa. I can hear her. I'll call her now. Hey, her voice is audible! -Earn your wage! -Yes, I'm sorry. I'll start right now. Die! Die! Die! Freak off, murderers! Murderers! Murderers! Get the freak out of here! Freak off! Our sincere apologies. Murderers! Have some food, too. Freak off! Freak off! -Thank you. -Thank you. Murderers! Murderers! Freak off and die! Murderers! Die, die, die! Die, die, die! Murderers! Murderers! Die, die, die! Die, die, die! Murderers! Murderers! Die, die, die, die, die, die, die! Die! Murderers! Murderers! Freak off! -Thank you for the meal, Miss Rana. -Thank you for the meal, Miss Rana. Murderers! Murderers! She slew someone, hasn't she? Yes. That's certain. And I thought it would work out this time! What are you laughing at? Murderers! You really are dumb! Stand and eat until you stop being dumb. Murderers! Die, die, die! Die, die, die! Stand properly! Murderers! Die, die, die! That's enough, she's annoying me. Murderers! Die! Die, die, die! Stop it now. Hopefully, she updates in the storehouse. But let's look for the next one. There's no time left! We have to do it before the asteroid hits! Once the Earth is destroyed, that's it! -Yes, Miss. -Yes, Miss. I'm sure you know... what we're doing is salvation. You two have to work hard as hell too. -Yes, Miss. -Yes, Miss. Next time... I swear I will bring someone worthy for you. I beg you for forgiveness... Lady Otafuku.
