The first time I saw her… I remember it very clearly. It was like, I was there with her. I mean, there was this sense of awe, the sound of the TV almost like dropped out, and I just-- I couldn't take my eyes off of her. In America, with education and hard work, it really does not matter where you came from, it matters only where you are going. [applause] Literally, my heart skipped a beat when I saw her. This is my secret that I've been walking around with for years. Cheers, Mom! May you live as long as you want, and never want as long as you live. That's good. I like that one. - Okay. - That's very good. You look nervous, what have you got to tell me? Ah... I have-- I have-- I've found someone. Really? - Yeah. - Good. - Who? - Um... For the last... six years or so, um... I... I've been in love with, uh... The Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. [laughs] Oh, Condi, Condi, I'm begging on my knees The desperate outlaws from Baghdad to Belgrade are still there and must be dealt with. [applause] Oh, Condi, Condi She's one of the most powerful women in the world and she's also the girl next door. Your quest is a way to frame Condi's story. I want to shine light on this extraordinary woman very few people know anything about. Oh, Condi, Condi Oh, Condi, Condi I was born and bred in New York City on the Upper West Side. I've always had a passion for music and it's always been my dream to get signed by a major label... [rock music] But now I've had a new dream. It's time for me to find her and to win her heart. If I'm gonna stand a chance, I've got to learn everything about her. Talk to the people who know her best, so I've agreed to let my friend Sebastian make a documentary about my courtship. In return, he's going to help me to meet her. This is my best shot for finding love, I can't blow it now. We start in Alabama where she was born. We then go to Denver where she found her calling to go from Denver to Stanford all the way to Washington, D.C. where she currently resides and where she came to power. I'm being deadly serious. Mom, she's one of the most... I thought you were gay. This is something that I did not even want to tell you now. I feel like an idiot that I got talked into telling you. I think you're-- I think you think you really are, right? I think your brain's a little addlepated right now. It's -- I don't know, honey, but you know, I know, I know being in love is very close to being insane. So you have no intention of getting an apartment? The money that you have been saving, - you've been working towards... - Yes. ...That you were going to use for an apartment you're going to use on some... demented odyssey? No! I'm using the money that I've been saving to get-- For the apartment. Well, or a house to share with her. You can't even do your own laundry. Dad, she has people to do... Condoleezza Rice, are you fucking nuts?! So what are you looking at? Hold on, I wanna show you something. It's-- it's hard to imagine my life without music. I certainly find it as a way to completely transport into another world. My secret weapon is music. It's the thing that we have the most in common. I have always had really eclectic taste in music. I love very, very hard rock; rhythm and blues; Motown. Some mornings it's Brahms some mornings it's Cream. So tell us about the films you've been making for her. Love discs are love letters in music and pictures. I've been making them for the past five years, but I've only sent one out. This is my first love disc ever. It's a little dated, but I'm still rather proud of it. [music] I'll hold your hand, together we'll stand On the brink of a brand-new day No more god-awful stuff Darlin', you've had enough And I've come to take you away With each cowardly blow No matter how low they go I'll pick you up and carry you away I'm your knight in shining armor You're my damsel who's had too much stress Chill, Condi, chill Chill, Condi, chill ...and that's enough of that. That was five years ago and they have gotten better since then. I have had my share of the ladies, but none of them have been as accomplished or as talented or as interesting as she is. Compared to her they're as deep as a shot glass. When I think of all the men in her life, you know, all these powerful professional men, I just can't believe that she hasn't been snagged up yet. Oh, wouldn't we all love to find somebody that you'd want to live the rest of your life with? Sure, but I've never thought you wanted to get married in the abstract. You want to get married to someone. I think with the love discs that you're helping me to make, how can she resist? This is a song I wrote called Invisible. [music] All my life, I've done nothing There's been no hope, I've been waiting To give my love People see through me I am invisible through and through And then I saw you in a sea of blank faces Amid all the people you stood alone You looked right through them And you saw me I've been invisible till I found you Where did the inspiration come from? Well, a lot of people have a lot of pretentious answers about their inspiration, but I just-- it just-- it-- it comes to me when I think about her. Condi is my muse. [music] [applause] I'm about to head off to Alabama. Very excited. This is the first love disc that you and I have created together. Sending it off to her. Here we go. Oh my God, I just did it. [laughs] [traffic noises] Now I'm a man, I'm a man Man, I am blood, sausage and sorrow And they'll never know, they'll never know, they'll never know What I got to give you, don't you know [PA announcement] From day one, I had great respect for Condoleezza Rice. [music] I'm a great admirer of Secretary Rice. I think she's a great American. [music] Look at this face! Beauty and intelligence. That’s great. [music] I grew up in a very nice, sheltered little middle-class community in Birmingham. My mother was a school teacher, my father was a minister and a high school guidance counselor and I'm still friends with a lot of the kids from that community. Vanessa, very nice to meet you. I'm Sebastian. I'm the director. Hi, how are you doing? Now let me introduce you to Devin. Uh, Devin is our love-struck courtier. - Pleasure to meet you. - Hi, how are you doing, Devin? I'm just a normal guy. - How are you? - Yes. So when did you first meet Condi? We were both five years old. I moved across the street from her. She was literally the girl next door? Yeah. It's the girl across the street. - Across the street? - Across the street. - Yes. - Wow. Okay, we're going to see the hospital. This is where it all started, right? Is this where Condoleezza was born? - Yeah. - In this hospital? In this hospital. Why was this all boarded? Why is it all boarded up now? Look, Devin, this is how it looked in 1954. Look at those cars. Those old cars. Yeah, that was 1954. Oh, why did they let this go? I mean this should be a landmark. She was born here November 14, 1954. - She was born November 14th. - Why is that special? That's when my mother was born. That's this-- that's my mother's birthday. Your mother's birthday is November 14th? - Yes. - Oh, okay. Look. Take a look. November 14th. Oh, okay, that's mom's birthday. Yeah, that's mom's-- Yeah. Mom's birthday. You gonna get one that says Condi on that side? - Yes! - [laughs] We're going around and see what it looks like. - See. - I'm Father Alex. - Nice to meet you. - Father Alex? - Pleasure. Pleasure to meet you. - This is Vanessa. I'm Vanessa. Do you have any idea why they would close-- why they would close this hospital? Because of the civil rights movement, other hospitals in Birmingham became accessible to African Americans, so this hospital no longer had an appeal or a need as it did at one time where you couldn't have a child, a baby, except at this hospital if you were black. Do you know where the actual maternity award was? I'm equally nervous and excited. It's gonna be dark in here. Okay. Wow. I can't believe that we're actually here. [sombre music] [infants crying in background] It's said that room 304 was most likely the room where she was born. Wait, seriously? Yes. Is that really it? Oh, Devin! Probably it's two beds. See? Probably it's two beds. [music] This is the Genesis. This is where it started. For the first three years of my life, we literally lived in the back of the church and I'm very proud of that heritage. She was a Christian from day one. In fact, her father was a preacher and read her the Ten Commandments as a little girl. She prays every day. She goes to church regularly. She believes that god has set forth a plan. One reason why she doesn't really look back that much is she doesn't dwell on the kind of mistakes she might have made, because what is happening is that God's plan is unfolding. I've never doubted the existence of God. My father was a theologian and I can remember from the time I was a very young kid, debating with him about the Bible and debating about this aspect of Jesus life. He never made me feel that my faith and my intellect were at war with one another. That's where she grew up. The house is still the same, except it's a different color. It was a dark green. Wow. See, that's the house. One year snow, and we made a big snowman. - Mm-hmm. - Right here. Look at that. You see that's her on the left and that's me on the right. - Yeah, yeah, sure. - That was January 1962. And we played outside a lot. We liked that. Six years and I never thought I'd be this close. How many mornings would she come racing out the door to go to school. There she is with her dolls. Oh my goodness. This is right here. She was standing right here. Yeah, standing right there at the bottom the step. Actually, it's a pretty good ratio between me and you and Condi and the doll. Yeah. [laughs] Hi, Maria. This is Devin. Hi, how you doing? Come on in. Thank you very much. Wow! She used to run right through here outside to meet you and play. Mm-hmm. Where do you think the piano was? I believe the piano was on this side. Music played a very important role in my childhood. My mother, my grandmother and my great-grandmother all played piano. My grandmother was also a piano teacher and I would bang at the piano when she taught her students trying to emulate what she was doing with her students, so she said to my mother, "Let's teach her to play." I was only about three and as a result I learned to play very, very young. I could read music before I could read. By the time she was five, she could play Beethoven and other classical music. She was-- she was good as a little girl. Everybody thought music was going to be her career. You've gotten this far. Come on in and look. Now you're actually in the room. You're actually in the room. Can you believe it? [laughter] She would read her books and do her homework here. And had a doll collection. She had a lot of dolls. [laughter] I remember going over to her house with my mom and she had all her dolls all nice in a row and kept them all cute and then we would sit them down at little tables and have tea parties. They would be our friends at the tea party. Was she a good tea host? She was always polite and offer you what she had, you know. She was the girl next door. She went to church with us. She bowled and she became the most powerful woman in the world. Just because she was a woman and just because she was black did not stop her from doing what she wanted to do. Our parents told us, "All right, it may be that you can't have a hamburger at the Woolworth's lunch counter and it may be that you can't go to this amusement park Kiddyland, but don't worry, you can do anything you want. Your horizon should be limitless." John Rice who was a Presbyterian minister was the most important person in Condoleezza Rice's life. Kind of a big mountain of a man, who really believed the most important thing he could do for black children, uh, including his daughter was to give them a sense of self and pride. Segregation wouldn't matter in your life; racism would not matter in your life, you can be whatever you want to be regardless of whatever the outside world tries to enforce upon you. When you were in school in segregated Birmingham, teachers said unashamedly, "You will have to work twice as hard to get ahead and if you really want to get ahead, you may have to work three times as hard" and they never said, "And isn't that unfair?" They stated it in the most matter-of-fact way and it did teach us all to sort of get on with life. [school bell] I think Condoleezza is a really good example because she's someone who came from this community. It allows our children to see that, you know, people that come from this community can do great things, so I would say a role model. I came to school here because my uncle taught school here at Brunetta C. Hill, and so at the end of the day, I would go home with my uncle. What do you think Condoleezza would think of me? Well, I would say she would have to meet you. You seem to be friendly. I think you would have to like music. I play the piano too. Oh, well, oh she would love that. You all could do a duet together. Oh, that sounds pretty good to me. [music] [guitar playing] Was I... [Singing under his breath] Birmingham is a symbol of hardcore resistance to integration. It is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. She came of age in the critical years of multi-racial America when it was really make or break. Was segregation gonna survive or be knocked out? I remember very well in 1963 when Birmingham was so violent when it acquired the name Bombingham. Even with my wonderfully protective family, you had to wonder, why are they doing this to us? Condoleezza was very seldom seen. She was an assistant when I would cut the grass at the church across the street, Westminster Presbyterian. I sometimes would go to the house with a lawn mower, stuff like that, I could see her peeping out the door. See, she was a kept-in child. There were certain areas in this city like walking to the store at night, my mom would not let me walk alone. I would have to go with at least one or two of my brothers for the fear of the night riders. [music] I wonder if she ever saw any of these people. I wonder if she ever encountered these wraith-like images coming up to her. Such a symbol of hate and fear. This is the church that turned things around September 15, '63. You see the cornerstone on the church? - Mm-hmm. - Those first windows to the right, this was the Sunday school area. They're getting ready for a Sunday school play. [glass shatters] They broke into Saturday night before, set the bomb. The bomb went off at 10:22. Since Sunday school is from 9:30 to 10:30, regular church is 11 to 1. So there was no question who the-- who the targets were. - Okay? - And it was specifically - set for the children. - Specifically set for the kids. The Sunday school and the Sunday school time. [music] It's awful. These were innocent children. This was homegrown terrorism. These little girls weren't going to hurt anybody. When the bomb went off, I don't know where Condoleezza was. I know where my daughter was, she was over at the 16th street Baptist church. She was in the little ladies room downstairs getting her clothes changed to whatever they were going to do that Sunday. I drove over to the University Hospital and that's where we found her and lying up there on the table with three other girls and it was very painful. Denise McNair was my little friend from kindergarten and she was a playmate, you know, and I just couldn't believe that she was dead. What stands out in Condi Rice's mind about that bombing is particularly memories of the funeral. She recalls being very moved by seeing those little coffins. That's an image that has been emblazoned in her memory. Who would have thought in September 1963 when my little classmate Denise McNair was killed in the bombing of that church that I would stand before you as Secretary of State. Condoleezza Rice's father took her to the White House in Washington. She was 10 years old. They looked at the White House, she said I want to be there. She was on a mission from her earliest age to prove to her father, to her mother. Rising up in those very tough years in Birmingham, her mission was to get to the top, to get to the top politically and that's exactly what she did. So this time we need a dedication to I think which is really tender and warm and sweet. Action! Hi, it's Devin Ratray again. This song that I wrote for-- No. See in the lens. See Condi's beautiful face. I don't see Condi's beautiful face in the camera, I see my double chin in the camera. Well, there's a difference between what you see in the lens and what I've got. And you're looking great. You're looking very slim - and very fit. - Good. And I have to say, rather attractive. - Good. - Okay. So let's go. Take two, and action! Hi, it's Devin Ratray again and this is a dedication of a song that I wrote for you, Condoleezza. Cut. So a couple of notes. A little bit warmer please, a little bit more tender. Hi, it's Devin Ratray again. I wrote this song thinking of you and thinking about you returning to your roots, walking through the streets of Birmingham. Walking in your footsteps really inspired me and I smelled the same air that filled your sweet lungs. So I hope you enjoy it and I hope you get to tell me in person someday what you think of it. Alrighty. Thanks. [music] Standby and... Action! I dreamed I took you back to Alabama I saw you running barefoot in the breeze We sat on the piazza in each other's arms In the shadows of the old orange trees And I was guiding your hands Teaching you my song And to me you were all humanity Somewhere in my dreams, my Condoleezza Where the last leaves are falling from the trees You'll never know you had this power over me You'll never know you had this power over me. We've landed in Colorado. Condi moved here when her dad got a job teaching at the University of Denver. She entered 10th Grade when she was only 13. She's two years younger than everybody else. In the last year here, she was already applying and taking classes at Denver University. She was at both at the same time. It was amazing. So we're gonna go talk to some of her former teachers. [piano] Hello. Hello. Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. Oh, god. I'm sorry. How are you? - I'm Devin. - And I'm Ann. - Hello, Ann, hi. - I'm Louise. If you had a classroom full of Condoleezzas, you'd think you'd died and gone to heaven. She was a senior in my class and she was going to DU at the same time. She was an excellent, excellent student. Very serious. Quite astute. - She aced all of her classes. - Oh yeah. All of them. College as well as high school. There was no bad subjects. She was good at everything she did? Well, she had a very academic background. Her father became the assistant dean at the Graduate School of International Studies and I think it was just in the whole family, they were very, very dedicated and directive to her. I think what's happened to me is 90% upbringing. I really do believe that my parents were extraordinary in what they provided for me and the kind of self-confidence that they gave me and they never said, no, you shouldn't do that or you shouldn't try that. They really had high expectations for me and they passed them on. You know, I think that was hard on her to be so young and I think she probably felt, "What am I getting into here?" and the only black girl in the class. I understood that something was deeply wrong in Birmingham, Alabama when I didn't have a white classmate until we moved to Denver, Colorado. It didn't take her long to, you know, acclimate to it, but she was also practicing the piano several hours a day. She wanted to be a concert pianist at the time she was here and if she didn't make that she was going to be a professional ice skater. I was a very, very bad competitive figure skater who worked exceedingly hard at it only to perform badly almost every time that I competed. But I think those experiences did help me to have a kind of discipline; a kind of sense of organization in life and to do a lot of things well. Very good. Keep your knees bent, waist back, because if you're going to win her heart right... - We've got to win her heart. - You gotta learn how to skate. - Gotta learn how to skate. - You gotta become a champion. Gotta be a champion. - I gotta do this. - There you go. - You got it. - I got it. - You got it, you're going good! - I got it. [thud] Ohh... - I think I got it. - You okay? - I got it. - Yeah? - Just gotta get up. - Okay. You got it? Ah! Do you have any aspirin? [orchestra] It's hard to imagine my life without music. I certainly find it as a way to completely transport into another world. Do you think music might be the way to her heart? Yes, because... music is the way to many people's hearts. Do you think that serenading could work today on Condoleezza as a courtship technique? It might very well, particularly since she has such an eclectic taste. Yeah, I would say yes. Go for it. As a student, how was she at taking direction? In taking very specific technical directions, she was very good; emotional directions, she didn't have an easy time doing that. As long as it was mechanical things: do this, hold your hand this way, or do that, fine, but as soon as I touched her inside, there was a resistance. She seemed not to be interested in that aspect of music making. Condoleezza Rice ended her music career at 17 when she was a sophomore at the University of Denver. That summer she went to the Aspen Music Camp and there she saw prodigies who could play from sight, music that had taken her months or weeks to learn. She saw she wasn't good enough and she dropped it with no emotion, no feeling whatsoever. It's not just talent, it's that intangible that some people have that just puts them over the top. I knew I didn't have it and I knew I probably wasn't going to practice hard enough to compensate for it. This was a very important turning point in Rice's life and so in one of our interviews I asked her about it and she said to me, "I don't do life crises. Period." She says she does not believe in regret. She thinks life is too short and so she doesn't look back on mistakes. She keeps looking forward. Self-reflection is not something she does. She believes it's a waste of time and I think it had a profound impact. Her one goal that she had set, she failed at. I think she didn't want to fail again. Well, I was a lost music major to be truthful about it. I had decided that I was not going to be a great concert pianist, but I didn't know what I was going to be. I wandered into spring quarter junior year, a course in international politics taught by Josef Korbel, and he was a wonderful professor because he was a great story-teller. He could really put you there in the Soviet Union or in Czechoslovakia or in Yugoslavia and I was just taken with him and with the history and I remember the exact lecture that won me over and it was one about how Joseph Stalin had consolidated his power and I thought this is just terrific. This is what I want to study and I went to him not long after that and I said, "Dr. Korbel, I think I'd like to study the Soviet Union." Josef Korbel was the professor who turned her on to international affairs. He taught her the drama that was inherent to global politics. He made her want to be a political scientist. It was as she put it "love at first sight." She was fascinated and she became smitten with everything to do with Russia and Russian politics. We don't know really what would have happened if Lenin had survived. It is really Joseph Stalin that made the Soviet Union into what the Soviet Union became: militarized, secretive, a Byzantine state behind the walls of the Kremlin, a state with pretensions to greatness on the international scene. Joseph Stalin, that is really the legacy of the Soviet Union, not Lenin. Now the other extraordinary thing about Josef Korbel was that he was also the father of Madeleine Albright. So he actually is a man who had the two American female secretaries of state in history, who were both as they both would tell you, the daughters of Josef Korbel. Albright literally and Condoleezza Rice, she says uh, figuratively, he was her second father. Well, Korbel was what is known as a realist. A kind of group of foreign policy specialists who believe you deal with states as they are, you know, great powers. The internal dynamics of those states doesn't quite matter as much. Realists don't believe and don't trust moral aspirations. They don't trust countries that say, "We're the moral ones, we're doing-- we have God on our side," realists don't trust that stuff. There is that belief in the concept of America that is an important part of Rice's philosophy. I think I have athlete's-- Athlete’s complex. She once said, "I will only marry a football player." I've got to do something about this. Well, we need to get you to meet these guys. They're the people who can teach you. What about contacting that ex-fiancé of hers, the football star, Rick Upchurch? You can meet him, you can say whatever you want to him, I'm not gonna have anything to do with it though. We're setting up an interview. You do the interview so what's the problem with that? You want me to do an interview with the one man that was engaged to her? Don't even bother. There's no way I'm going. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Hello, Devin, how are you? Hello, Sebastian. - It's a great pleasure. - Honor and a pleasure. Today is Condoleezza's birthday and this is the first time that I've had the opportunity to tell the story. There was tens of thousands of young ladies that were here in this stadium and there was only one young lady that I really wanted and that was Condoleezza. When Condoleezza first saw me, I was in my second year with the Denver Broncos and I just remember I had a fantastic year that year. I had set a couple of records, had returned two punt returns, man, in one game against the Cleveland Browns. I ended up tying a record for touchdowns in a season. All of a sudden, everybody was starting to recognize that Rick Upchurch was here and he was making some noise out on the football field. My first encounter was going over to Condoleezza's house and meeting Dr. John Rice and talking with him about school and she met me and says, "Oh, you're that-- you're that guy that that returns those punts and that whole deal." and she says, "You're a pretty good ball player." She really focused in on the football aspect of it because she was really interested in the game. Condi's appetite for football is just like war. She likes to strategize and put herself in a-- in a position of power and a position of control and being able to make decisions and she would probably be one heck of a football coach. The thing that I knew is that she had a lot of smarts about her. Very intelligent. Some of the questions she would ask and the things that she would talk about just let you know that this was a lady with a lot of class and a lot of poise. She was truly an American princess. Okay, this is where I first met Condoleezza. This is where I first courted Condoleezza and this is where I proposed to Condoleezza. Now, where was it that you first held Condoleezza's hand? I first held Condoleezza's hand in the house. One night I was getting ready to leave and I just grabbed her hand and just told her I said, good night. And where was the first place that you kissed her? The first place that I that I kissed her was at the door. As I was leaving, I gave her-- I gave her a kiss. When I said I loved her, she actually looked at me and says, "You know, I like you too," you know, and uh, and at that point in time um, I felt like, you know, we could go some places as far as our relationship was concerned. You know, I like cheeks and she had big cheeks. She had some juicy cheeks. I just wanted to kiss 'em, so I kissed 'em. And was there a lot of cheek action in terms of touching her cheeks and...? Absolutely. What I would do is I would put my hand up and just touch her cheeks and that whole deal and I would kiss her on her cheeks. [makes kissing sounds] And where was the first time that you had your first like what is traditionally known as a French kiss? [music] Never did. Didn't have no French kiss with her. I never had a French kiss with her. You know, Condoleezza had gone out on dates and had seen other people uh, and, and one thing that she says is that she was-- she was respectful of her body and that was something that she was going to to save for marriage. She would date and she would meet people, but going outside of that, she would not do. She didn't feel like she needed to give her body up to show her love to anyone and so she wasn't going to have sex before marriage. She's not married now. Do you think that she's kept that promise? I think Condoleezza Rice today is still holding on to those same principles. In England we had the Queen Elizabeth I, who was known as the Virgin Queen. What do you think it means to be the virgin secretary of state? Yeah, I'm not-- yeah, I'm not going there. [laughs] I'm not going there, Sebastian. Here in this room here is where I first proposed to Condoleezza. Here’s the ring and, um, the ring wasn't a whole lot. Imagine Condi is Devin and what exactly would you say to him? I said-- I said, "Condoleezza..." I said, "Condoleezza Rice..." I said, "Um, I'm in love with you. Would you marry me?" and she said yes. So then I offered the ring to her. I offered the ring to her and she put it on. But there was a roadblock there. She had an offer to go to Washington, D.C. and work there. And we knew at that point in time that her job was important to her and her career was important to her and by me staying here and by her going to Washington, D.C., that it wouldn't-- it wouldn't work. She basically chose Jimmy Carter over you. She chose-- she chose power over love. She chased her dream and today she's living that dream. Another year, another birthday, but you keep on looking younger. I am so impressed with you, Condi. I'm so impressed. Each new day I find out more about you. I am so impressed, you've gone this long holding out and sticking to your principles. Good for you. I hope you enjoy this next love disc I made for your birthday. Happy birthday. [music] Lonely girl From another world... Little Miss Rice The Queen of the ice She's too brave For the King and the Knave Just look at her eyes She finds the tiny golden key To everything she wants to be In Wonderland Condi, In Wonderland Where does she go When she's feeling low...? Inside the heads Of the reddest of reds She's too wise For the Soviet spies She could rip 'em to shreds She finds the tiny golden key To everything she wants to be In Wonderland All alone In Wonderland Alone and pure I really can't believe you got so busy you would forget your mother's birthday. I went under the knife to give you life, that's why you have a perfect shaped head. You didn't get my flowers? No. Oh, well, you-- you should be getting them soon. You know, like two days from now, right? Uh, well it takes a while. I don't need any flowers. I don't need any more flowers. I'll make it up to you, I promise. If I-- and if-- I hadn't-- tried-- You're breaking up. I love you, Mom, I'll call you soon. Okay. Bye. Yeah, bye. I love you. I'm not a good son. [music] [music] [music] I can't believe I let you... What's Condi going to think if I'm sitting there trying to almost break into her mother's house? Clara Bailey Rice and Condoleezza Rice today are very close. Condoleezza Rice calls her her second mother. Uh, Clara certainly thinks of Condoleezza as a daughter. So they're still very, very close and they talk most Sundays. Oh my God, that's her. That's her. - Mrs. Rice? - Yes. - Hello. - Hi. My name is Sebastian Doggart. This is Devin Ratray. - Hi, Devin, how are you? - Hi, Mrs. Rice. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Pleasure meeting you. I'm a very big admirer of your stepdaughter. Do you know if she's gotten any of my discs that I've sent her? I have no idea. He's a musician and he's writing songs for her, because he's in lo-- It sounds like it's a wonderful thing, you know, that you guys are positive and it's about time something positive is said about her. But she is an American princess, isn't she? Yeah, she is. Well, that's what we want to show and who better than the American queen who she says is my second mother... Yeah, yeah but, um, I don't do that without permission. Okay? Please let her know that I'm a huge admirer and... I'll talk to her tomorrow and I'll tell her that I talked to you... Ask her to have a listen to the discs if she's gotten them, please. You sent them to her? - I have. - Okay. I will. Thank you so much and your pansies are fantastic. Yeah. - I love your daughter. - All right. - Thank you. - All right. [dog growls] You blindsided her. You didn't even offer to help her with her-- with her bags. Look at that Mercedes. She nearly bit my finger off. You deserve it. I was an associate dean in the office of faculty affairs when a faculty member came to us and said that he had just discovered a young scholar who had given a pretty good paper on Sino-Soviet relationships and he thought that it might be wonderful for Stanford to use Affirmative Action funds in this way and so money was made available for her appointment. I'm sure there was a concern not to miss an extraordinary opportunity to hire someone who was a woman, who was black and who was also, you know, stunning personally and intellectually. She discussed with me how she was counted six times as a black and a woman for Affirmative Action purposes in the Arms Control, Disarmament set of the Political Science Department and one other unit, so she actually showed up as six at Stanford. So she was making fun of the Stanford Affirmative Action Program. She's admitted at various times that she's a beneficiary of Affirmative Action, yet she uses her personal story to say “I didn't need government action. I didn't need public protest to advance. I advanced, um, all on my own.” I'm clearly a package: I'm black and I'm female, but I've always thought that the most important thing is to do your job and do it well and don't question other people's motives for your selection. Condoleezza Rice, uh, in 1991 was made provost. She's the youngest person ever to get that job, the only African-American, the only woman. Suddenly she's inheriting a deficit in the budget of some 20 million dollars. For my 20th tenure at Stanford, she called me in. She said, "Oh, Cecilia, I'm so glad to see you and I want to thank you because you really were so helpful to my father and that's why this is a bit hard but, you know, I know you're not happy and I know you want to leave, so I'm making it possible for you to leave." We were quiet, I stood up, I walked out and she said to her secretary in a deep sort of-- she took a deep breath and she said, "Oh, good. Who's next?" I always remember that little tone. Cecilia Burciaga was the first Latina to make it to the top of Stanford. She was a super popular Dean of Students and she had a center where students love to come. This is a woman who was simply cut down. Her career destroyed. This was sort of Condoleezza Rice's step to advancement. For her it was more important to show she was tough, show she could cut the budget even when it came down to cutting the most advanced Latina. It was a very contentious decision at the Stanford campus. The numbers show that when she became provost, she basically reversed what had been an institutional commitment by Stanford to try to diversify its faculty and the upper levels of its administrative staff. She essentially kind of pulled up the ladder, you know, after she had gotten that helping hand. In education in particular I continue to believe that Affirmative Action that is not driven by quotas is an extremely important thing to practice. A college-based committee formed a report, produced a report about the state of play of race relations on the campus and the degree to which the college was not obeying, uh, that dictates, the demands of Affirmative Action, Condoleezza Rice's response wasn't to try to figure out what could be done to make it better, her response was to debate the data very angrily. Her name she says means "with sweetness" But, you know, she says she speaks Spanish so she always also knows that her name means Condolencia: "with pain." Um... Devin, do you have any questions? Do you think her sense of fashion has defined her as a woman and as a politician? [music] Look at me, I've got hooves for hands, socially; Oh, look at me, 'Cause I'm going to hell … in a basket Cut it. Cut it. Good. Look at me, I've got hooves for hands, I'm a forked beautiful animal and I want to be your mate. So just show her-- show your hands then. It's very good. Looks great. Okay, let's go for another take please. [music] Don't look at me, I've got hooves for hands, socially; Oh, look at me, because I'm naked, and I have to be. Cut it.“Don’t look…” Dev, it's good, it's good. - Yeah? - How are you feeling? Sorry, I just didn't want to be boring. And it's a little boring. That's my only concern. My only little concern here. I think we just need to sort of take it to the next level and you're completely in control here so you can make a decision about this, but this line "look at me because I'm naked," because I think it is-- this is really justified is to go-- is to perform this naked. I don't want to show her naked. I don't want to show myself to her before our wedding night naked. I wouldn't ask an actor to do anything I wouldn't do. Sebastian, I'm not an actor. I'm not act-- I mean, I'm trying to convince a woman that I love. I know you're not. Now take your shirt off. Wha...? Sebastian, please don't do this. I think this is almost harassment. Why am I so--? And what about the earwig? They'll see everything. We're seeking truth here and truth requires nudity. Why does this require nudity? Because it's nudity of the soul. This is not what I wanted to do. Sebastian, I'm feeling like I'm being raped by you! Stop it! Stop! Get the fuck out of here! I'm done! I'm done! I'm done! Are you an artist or not an artist? Are you going to stop at this point with your boxers on?! Tell the truth. Are you ready?! Are you ready?! I can't do this! I cannot! Oh my God! - No fucking way! - You're gonna do this. No. I'm not looking. I'm not looking. No, Sebastian, don't do this! Don't do this to me! Get off of me! Fucking get him away from me! Fucking do something! - Dev... - No, no, no, no, no. - I just come to say something. - No, no. I really-- no, I really-- I can't talk to you right now. I'm trying to write something. I definitely don't want cameras on right now. I really don't want to deal with this, please. I just want to say I'm really, really sorry for what happened on the beach today. I overstepped the mark. I was-- I guess a little bit stressed. I was doing stupid things. I'm just deeply sorry. How's the music coming along? It sucks, Sebastian. I just feel like I'm drying up. I've got an idea. I've got this person I know in L.A. Her name is Carol Connors and she is a great songwriter. I think you and she could work really well. How do you know Carol Connors? I made a film about her cats. She paid me forty thousand dollars to make a film about her cats. And for our final impersonation, we will do... [hums Star Wars theme] Yoda from Star Wars. [Star Wars theme] [applause] I'm gonna pretend you're making that up. No, I'm not. I'm not. She lives alone in the Hollywood Hills with her cats and she is still one of the most amazing songwriters. And that's my makeup for what happened today. Carol, nice to meet you. Sebastian, good to see you, sweetie, how are you? Very well. Let me introduce you to Devin Ratray. - Hi. - Devin. He's the patient you're gonna work on. We have things to talk about. Carol as you know the reason we're here is because Devin is on a rather special mission to meet a rather special woman and I think you are the person who can guide him in the right way musically and Elvis was gentle with you the first time. I mean, is that important...? Oh he was gentle with me many, many, many, many times. I was so shy. He was my first love. He was just wonderful. What kind of tips do you have for him? I think gentleness is going to be your key here. And remember, underneath the heart of our secretary of state beats the heart of a woman. Okay. Okay, I've written a song for you because I really think that this is important. Condoleezza, Condi, I think of you so fondly, Sugar 'n spice, everything nice Wedding bells and a handful of rice… Remember, this is the secretary of state and she's on the world stage. I mean, it's very logical the song, but there's a romantic feel to it. I'll be in front of the-- No! I'll be in front of the towers At the Watergate - Important word is Watergate. - Hmm. That's where she lives and think of it as, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair." I don't like her hairstyles sometimes but... - Why? - I don't know, but towers is very good because she lives in the towers at the Watergate. Get it? Your beauty's in everything That I see, Condi, you mean the world to me. To me... God you're almost as good as Plácido Domingo. Thank you! So, Carol, I know you have another song which is your new, Gonna Fly Now. - Yes! - That's what I need. - A type of song like that. - It's... It's... it's very Rocky-ish. It's a "Yo, Stallone!" you know, that type of-- it's got tremendous energy. I'll settle for that just a measly snack If that would make Condi mine! Mine! Mine! He's gonna win her, win her, win her When he is a little thinner, thinner, thinner Win her, win her, win her When he's thinner The trumpets are blaring. Win her, win her, win her When he's thinner, thinner, thinner Oh my god winner, dinner. Oh my god, the brownies. - Bravo! Bravo! - Oh, thank you so much. I'm so glad you like it. The brownies smell like they're burning. How are you feeling? It sounded kind of like wet pieces of shit sprinkled on a Jerry Lewis film. Dev... It's perhaps the most insulting song I've heard thus far. Excuse me. Excuse me. I don't-- I'm not an eavesdropper, but what the fuck did you just say. Devin, let me just make something plain, okay? When you become an Academy Award songwriter, then you can sit here and tell me that I don't know what I'm doing. - God! - I am so upset... Carol, this song is making fun of me. - It's telling me... - I'm not making fun of you. - It's genius. - How can I...? - I mean... - Thank you. - This is the secretary... - She's a genius. Have some respect. It's a beautiful song. It's well... No it's a powerful song. I don't want to say it's beautiful. - Powerful?! - The other song is beautiful... "Just the measly snack would make me want her back"? No. That's not what it says. Don't fuck up my words. I-- don't talk to me. Carol, I cannot possibly approach The Secretary of State of The United States with this song and expect her to take me seriously. Why not? You're denying her one of the biggest gifts she can give you? I'm not singing the song! I'm not singing the song. I can't do this. You know something, I don't want him to sing the song. I don't want anybody to sing. Read these lips, I think George H. Bush said that. - Your friend? - Yes. President Bush. Didn't you sing at his inauguration? I sang at George W.'s. Both of his. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. Read my lips. - Okay. - Carol... - He's doing it. - Guys, together. This is insanity. I will sing the song together. Why are you going to sing the song? Because it's a great idea. He's your inner self and I have to go check the brownies and if you're not good you're not going to get a brownie. I'm like-- I can't even have a brownie? Peace and love. Where are we? Uh, my friend Adrian Grenier, uh, his offices. How do you know Adrian? Uh, we were high school friends. What do you think he's talking about? What do you think he's talking about, huh? She's dead. You got to wake up. Hey, what's up? What's going on, man? - How you doing? - Good. Really good. How are you? I think it's very important that you make sure that you prove to her that you show her that you are being a sincere, honorable, loving human being. Dude, come on secretary of state, powerful woman, boring old white guys all day, she's got to be a big dirty submissive and you grab her by the hair and you spank her. Oh, Jim, whoa easy. - I mean, you got to be delicate. - Yeah. - I mean... - You don't. Take what's yours. Smack her around a little bit. Spank her. That's what she likes. Oh, whoa. No, no, no, no. There's no smacking. How could I ensure my sincerity? Just humble yourself. You have to be able to find some way into a more tender part of her. Yeah, but you got to remember something. You know, she was a Democrat until the late '70s? Yes. And because Jimmy Carter wouldn't invade Afghanistan and attack the Russians, she left. - That's true. - She likes it when you go in. She's with Bush Senior, she's with Bush Junior. She likes it when you go in and take what's yours. You're not going to get her in the mind. You got to get her on like an emotional visceral... - Yeah... - Some... Yeah. So like I don't know if you like maybe wore some lingerie or something as simple as that. Look, I don't want to fight with you. I don't want to fight with you, but I understand the Condi thing. I've seen her body, she's fucking sexy. That little gap between the teeth, how sexy is that. Just be careful of those teeth. They can get caught in your bag. - Watch those little... - Fucking, Jim! Honestly?! My bag between her gap?! Is that really advice that I need? All right, man. Good luck. Let's play. [music] Man, these Hollywood types have addlepated my brain. I need some time home to recharge the batteries before that last push to DC. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, honey-man, welcome home. - Thank you. - Oh, I missed you. Hi. I missed you too. Hi, Dad. I had to go to Duane Reade last night. I'm standing there at, uh, on line last night and here's the Enquirer: "who's gay and who's not." - Who's that? - So she's not. So she's one of the ones that's not. Well, let's see what the National Enquirer has to say. Oh, yes, let's see... According to the buzz among political insiders, it's an open secret that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is gay. One in-the-know blogger claimed that during her years at California Stanford university, Condi was "Completely out as a lesbian and it was not a scandal, just a reality." You're reading the National Enquirer. I totally agree at my appalling purchase. You're just trying to get me upset. I just walked in the front door. I'm not trying to get you upset. - Yes, you are! - I'm looking for... Hey, hey, hey. You and she are both interested in women. There's something in common that you have. Devin, Devin, come here. I'm going to sleep. I'm going to bed. - I've been up all night. - We know. Okay. It's all right. It's all right. I'm going to bed. No, no. Come here. Come here. - No, no, no. - You just got home... I know I just got home. and I can't deal with this right now. Guys, look please disconnect the phone. I'll unpack tomorrow. You can't... Welcome home, dear. You don't know when to quit, do you? Devin, I'm sorry. Dev? All because I'm in love. Doesn't matter. It's just love. Long before Condoleezza Rice was part of the team that brought us the Iraq war, she was one of those who believed that corporate interests come first. During the ten years the Condoleezza Rice was on the board of the Chevron Corporation, big oil developers. They were exploiting the oil off the coast of the Niger Delta in Nigeria. Home to some of the world's poorest people and indigenous people like the Ogoni people; who at that time were fighting for some revenue to come to them from this oil that was being drained out from underneath their homeland. Throughout that period, it was the Nigerian government's policy to suppress protest and to arrest and, in some cases, shoot down and kill the protesters. The corporations that cut deals with the Nigerian government were complicit with that and were sued for being complicit with that in U.S court. Now, the interesting thing about your friend Condoleezza Rice, Devin, is that she was playing an active role in turning shareholder initiatives back when the shareholders were saying “we want to be pushing for more human rights not ignoring abuses at the Nigerian government's hands.” Wait. You're saying the Nigerian government killed its own people to ensure Chevron had exclusive oil rights to their country? Yeah. I hate to break it to you, Devin, she picked empire and colonialism over being a concert pianist. I think you've got to think about that, Devin. There's an easy way to Condoleezza Rice's heart. You just need to promise her a few oil contracts in the Caspian Sea, maybe give her a few seats on a few corporate boards. Nothing she likes better. How's he gonna do that? Well, you've got your work cut out for you, let's face it. Great. She became a member of the Bush inner circle when she was discovered by Bush Senior's National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and brought into Washington to be part of the National Security Council. Here among all these grand men was this little slip of a girl. I had never met her before, but I soon found that she held her own with all these very senior people. When he introduced her to Gorbachev, he said, "This is Condoleezza Rice, she's taught me everything I know about the Soviet Union." Bush Senior wanted his son George to meet her. Of course she's a foreign policy specialist especially an Eastern European specialist. He had a lot of studying to do. Can you name the president of Chechnya? No, can you? Uh, the new prime minister of India is, uh, uh... No. George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice hit it off from the very beginning, based on their common affinity, uh, in things like, uh, their sports and their Christian faith. Uh, they had this instant as one of Rice's best friends called it "mind meld" that happened from the very beginning. During the course of the 2000 election campaign she'd really been President Bush's tutor on foreign affairs. President Bush had been governor of Texas, had very little background in foreign policy or national security. She's the one who taught him these issues during the course of the campaign. I advise him on how to take his very strong principles and values. What it is that he wants to do in the world and translate those into policy initiatives. Rice, when it came to Bush, saw in this young Texas governor the values, the strength, the vision of Ronald Reagan. At the same time, the moderation and wisdom, intelligence of Bush's father for whom she had worked. She thought with these two personalities combined into one president, she thought they could burst into Washington and they were going to remake the world. Not only to promote what was good for the world but also to promote what's good for American interests. George W. Bush believes that America has a special responsibility to keep the peace, that the fair cause of freedom depends on our strength and purpose and I want to assure you if the time ever comes to use military force, President George W. Bush will do so to win because for him, victory is not a dirty word. [cheering and applause] I realize how much I have to learn about the world of politics that I am now thoroughly immersed in the center of it all. This Washington minefield. Oh come on, you know! Assholes! [music] So here we are, Omnicom. This is Frank Luntz's dark empire. Are you ready? Whatever! So just make sure you're respectful to him. This is the guy who's responsible for getting Schwarzenegger into office, Jeb Bush into office. Language is perfection, because it is personal, it is human. The power of innovation is that it helps people. It allows them to inspire and aspire to things that are greater. Frank Luntz, this is Devin Ratray. How are you doing? Pleasure to meet you. - How are you? - Good. Good to meet you. If you want to actually court her, I do know language and I do no presentation, and that ain't it. I'm taking diet tips from Augustus Gloop here, man. What is that shirt made of? - What's the fabric of that shirt? - Rayon. Everything from now on is 100 percent cotton and wrinkle-free. - Those shoes... - Yeah? Did you get them in the 1950s? Are they your father's bowling shoes? I want shoes that have a professional look to them. Next thing, what is this? What is that? What do you call that? - These? - Yes. These are my sideburns. - Okay. - My mutton chops. Yes. No sideburns. Hold on. This is my individuality, man. Would you tell Elvis not to use, not to...? No, I won't tell Elvis anything because he's dead. What would you tell her about the Middle East Peace Accord? Um... Palestinians need to be represented. Okay. We'll call the Palestinians just for short "scum." Where does she stand on the Middle East? Well, she believes in a strong Israel. Okay. So she recognizes that the Palestinians have to have-- Don't play with your hair. - I didn't play with my hair. - You just played with your hair. - You just did. - What is he talk...? You've got the monitor. Play it back. What would Bush say in terms of the Middle East? Uh, we need strategery. Strategery. Excellent. What would Dick Cheney say? "Kill them all. Fuck the Jews. Fuck the Jews. Fuck the Palestinians. Kill them all. I need blood." That's what Cheney would say? Uh, it was a tape recording. I-- I-- I see. - Pirated. - Yes. Do you think that putting them down is gonna help your cause? I mean, explain to me here how this is gonna work? You're gonna go in and you're gonna say these things flippantly or are you gonna say this with convition-- conviction? There are consequences for everyone's accountability. That's not conviction. Conviction is: "9/11 changed everything." Let me hear you say it. 9/11 changed everything. Even more emphatic. 9/11 changed everything! Perfect. That's conviction. You're gonna get one shot. You're gonna get one opportunity. Do you have the words, do you have the passion, do you have the focus of someone who can woo her? You're such a beautiful woman. Can you get him a breath mint, please? I can see that you're a little nervous. Your hands are clammy, but I don't want you to be intimidated by me just because I'm a person who knows what I want... But you are a large person. There's more of me to love. I would strongly urge that his first meeting with the secretary not be over a meal. I'm taking notes here from the Pillsbury Doughboy. It's just not fair. What you don't understand is I'm not trying to court the secretary of state, the most powerful woman on the globe. This is Words that Work. This book will help you communicate. Good language is like a great meal and I assume that you'd understand that metaphor. Didn't see that one coming. I'm pleased that you take this so seriously. The focus group is going to tear you apart, but it's not just words, it's also appearances. - Well. Devin. - Devin. This is your stylist. I'm going to make you a runway model. Yeah, well you better reinforce that runway. He should run away very quickly. Listen, once you look at yourself in the mirror and you see this presidential transformation that I'm going to create for you, you're going to be mentally ready and visually ready to meet her. Condoleezza loves shoes, so you must love shoes. [music] The shoes make the man. That's very nice. That's like I'm going to the prom. All right. I look like the Joker. You have these in a 17? [music] Ever since I was a little girl I liked to shop. My father would go to work on his sermons on Saturday morning, and my mother and I would head downtown to go shopping. I think she looks very powerful despite the fact that she dresses in a way that is both feminine and has a certain degree of sensuality to it. If anything I think it makes her perhaps look even more powerful. [music] Oh, God! That's the new Devin. You have been transformed into a presidential candidate. I believe that children are our future. I will not be Bush-whipped. 9/11 changed us all. Ma. Ma? Hi, darling. All good. - Huh? - Hello. Hello. What are you doing? I just want-- I just wanted to tell you that, uh, I'm gonna be moving out. What do you mean? - For good? - Yeah. Yeah, I think. Um, I could be gone for a while, so I just wanted to thank you for everything that you've done. Uh, you've been very kind. You've been-- you've been everything that I could possibly want. - Everything I needed. - Why are you so formal? I don't know. I don't know. I've never done this before. I just gotta do it. [cries] Mom. Mom... Well, you act like you don't even care. Mom. Come on. Don't do it. Don't cry. This is... I know it's time to fly away, but where are you going? I'm going to Washington... D.C. Need I ask why? You needn't. Okay. All right. - So you're going to Washington? - Yeah. I should have known that was coming. You're going to see big things coming from me. Well, I hope. I have no doubt about your success. I want you to do anything that makes you happy but stay out of trouble. I always do that, Mom. That wasn't so bad. No, it wasn't, was it? I suppose I'll hear from you. Yes, you totally will, Mom. When you want something. You'll hear from me. [music] [music] Got to your city and I feel so alive, I'm inching closer to the heart of your mind. Ev'rything I see is like a monument to you, Ev'rything I dream of is finally comin' true, I'm feelin'... Free in the arms of the brave and true, Free in the place where I've come to find you, No one to tell us how we're not meant to be... Baby, we're finally free, Baby, we're finally free, baby, we're finally free... I am honored, in fact, humbled, uh, that President-elect Bush has asked me to serve as his National Security Adviser. In January 2001, when Condoleezza Rice took the oath of office to be National Security Adviser it was, uh, the ultimate rise in political power. This we're talking about a little girl who grew up in segregated Birmingham, Alabama and yet she had gone from that place in her life, uh, all the way up to literally the right hand of the President of the United States. I'm so impressed. - Good to see you. - Good to see you too. - Perfect tie. - Yeah? - Nice suit. - Thank you. It's from Florence. Well, you still got the sideburns but, you know what? Oh, this is so much improvement. - Come on back. - Thanks. These are the people right there. - Would you grab a seat? - All right. - Let's take the group. - Thank you. Boy, nothing to make you relax like a bunch of strangers judging everything you say or do. I need a word or phrase that you would use to describe Condoleezza Rice? Sophisticated. Well-traveled. - Regal. - Captivating. Hot. - Together. - Incompetent. In some ways, this is the most important part of the session because Devin may not get a chance to meet her personally. She may only respond to a video that he's put together. We're going to measure your second by second reaction which is what Secretary Rice would have as watching this video. Love discs are love letters in music and pictures. Dude, “love disc” doesn't work. Look at that. - [laughter in background] - Look at that response. [laughter in background] That's as low as it gets. I'm sorry. Wow. I mean that's lower than when Bill Clinton used the phrase, "It depends on the meaning of the word 'is' is." I want a word or phrase to describe Devin based on what you saw. We're going to start in the front. Potential Cyrano de Bergerac. - Terrible. - Sad. Uh, very sad, desperate. Embarrassing. I thought it was sweet and genuine. He's not my type. It is a little unfortunate that most people are very shallow and will be put off by his clear physical deficiencies. [laughter] What exactly do you mean by that? - [laughter] - Sideburns, his sideburns. Sideburns? How many of you would keep the sideburns, raise your hands? How many of you would take them off? Overwhelming. I want you to put your dials as to what you thought of Devin at the end of that video. Give him a rating between zero and 100. Now I want you to take a look at the new Devin. - Wow. - Very nice. Now give him a rating. Laura what's the rating for men and women now? 48/66. Women are at 66. How many women went up based on looking at him now? There you go. Why? Why'd you go up? He looks great in a suit. Looks more serious and respectable. Thank you. She likes clean-shaven men. The sideburns have to go. She would never look at you. The only thing that's stopping me right now is me. [dramatic music] [dramatic music] Ahhh! [dramatic music] Nothing of value is really ever won without sacrifice. [Sombre dramatic music] [Sombre music] A rebirth... a re-Genesis. A lot of people will tell you that Rice was weak and she was too weak to be National Security Adviser when she had these titans on either side, uh, Rumsfeld and Cheney on one side, and Powell on the other. Probably three of the best bureaucrats that have ever worked the system. Huge egos. Much more experience than she had particularly in national security issues and foreign policy. So I think what you see is when she realizes that she can't beat Dick Cheney or Donald Rumsfeld, she learns how to maneuver around them. She decided to use her personal relationship with the president to gain power inside the Administration. Rice's relationship with President Bush is very close. She goes to Camp David a lot. She stays in the main house at Crawford. So it is a very unusual relationship between the President and his National Security Adviser. Well, there's a famous story about how, uh, Condoleezza Rice and George W. Bush are in the U.N in the General Assembly and he actually passed a little note to Rice. What the note said was, "Can I go to the bathroom?" You have a President of United States, the most powerful man in the world who literally would not go to the bathroom without asking permission of Condoleezza Rice. This is not a woman who thinks in seconds or minutes. This is a woman who thinks in decades. I think she came to this conclusion very early and she said, "Well, I build my intimacy with the president. I become a very close confidant of the president. I build my power and my eye’s on the prize. If I do this, I'll be the next Secretary of State." On to the White House. [music] [birds chirping] [music] Cometh the hour, cometh the Man. I am that Man. This is it. The climax of all of our struggles. Inside there is where it all happens. [music] [cheering] This is grassroots democracy at its best. - Hi. Devin? - Hi. - Yes. - I'm Tracy. Tracy, nice to meet you. Are you ready to move today? I'm ready to move the world today. [applause] [cheering] Okay, take positions, please. [music] I'll be standing there When you're on the world stage Standing there if you're ever afraid, Standing by, when you're standing tall For you, my love, I'll always be on call… I'll be in front of the towers At the Watergate My very long-legged Secretary of State I'll stand up When you sit down Condi, you make my world go round 'n round 'n round 'n round Cause you're my Condoleezza, Condi, I think of you so fondly, Sugar 'n spice, everything nice Wedding bells and a handful of rice… Your beauty's everywhere, In everything that I see When you're splashed In the headlines and on my TV You're all I could want When I'm in DC. Condi, you mean, you mean the world to me… Cause you're my Condi Condoleezza once, And you're my Condi Condoleezza twice Cause you're my Condi Condoleezza true, There's nothing I won't do For Condoleezza Rice [buzzer] We're trying to deliver this to the Secretary of State. You know, she doesn't work here, she's the Secretary of State. This is the White House. Might makes right As you circle the globe North Korea to Iran They're shakin' from head to toe Don't mess with the Good ole U.S. of A Or you may get Condi's boot up your derriere… America's countin’ on you, Condi To fight the good fight To be a champion of our people, Tho' a hangin' chad to the right George W.'s a little bush in your way Condi for President in 2012 we say... I'll do anything to please ya, Condoleezza So please please let me squeeze ya, Condoleezza Please ya Squeeza ya Need ta tease ya On my knees I'm here ta please ya Please please please, Condoleezza! Come out, Condi, please! [music] [music] Being in love is very close to being insane. I ask you, Dr. Rice, whether you recall the title of that PDB. I believe the title was: "Bin Laden Determined To Attack Inside The United States." The August 6 presidential daily brief was one of dozens scores of intelligence reports that reached the White House in the spring and summer of 2001 about terrorist threats. The CIA, George Tenet and Richard Clark, Condoleezza Rice's counterterrorism director were really banging on the door every day. Her door every day saying, “there is this dire threat.” I cannot tell you that there might not have been a report here or a report there that reached somebody in our midst. She acknowledged that she couldn't recall whether she had discussed the presence of Al-Qaeda cells in the United States with President Bush. Condoleezza Rice was the gatekeeper. She was the person who determined what information got into the president. It was a pivotal role. I just don't buy the argument that we weren't shaking the trees enough and that something was going to fall out that gave us somehow that little piece of information that would have led to connecting all of those dots. Had photographs of Midhar and Al-Hosni been put on television, would they have come to the airports on September 11th? There were people on the 9/11 Commission and on staff who would tell you it was both incompetence and negligence. [music] [music] 9/11 was such a dramatic, terrible, horrible event, it forced her to reevaluate things that she had thought were true before. More idealistic than she had been before. There are critics who say that there was a Condi before 9/11 and a Neo-Condi after 9/11. I believe what happened with Condoleezza Rice after 9/11 was that we saw a Realist transform into an Idealist. This thing that Josef Korbel had had such an important role in sculpting in Rice's own head came apart and she found George W. Bush's idealism. We go forward to defend Freedom and all that is good and just in our world. I don't have a good feeling about this. Isn't this a little stalker-ish? It's gonna be fine. Okay. Here we go. Let's break into the Watergate. [music] You sure this is a good idea? Sure, it's a good idea. We've got to get into her world. [music] I have a package to deliver to a resident here under “Rice”. Okay. I'll call them. Thank you. Um, we have come with a gift for Secretary Rice and was wondering if we could give a, er, gift. It's a-- some cake for her. No, but I need to ask you to leave right now though. We tried. Oh, look, there's Security. Shall I try with the Security services? Maybe that's not the best thing to do, Sebastian. I'll be over there, away from Security. You're not allowed to be here, okay? This is a love offering. My friend is in love with her and, uh... I realize that. It's very touching, but you can't deliver anything here. It has to be delivered to the PR department, okay? Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I do. I think the general view of Dr. Rice's testimony was that she was filibustering. I think Dr. Rice was well aware of the restrictions of time and was chewing up the clock with long and rambling discourses. The question is what did we need to do about that... And fuel-filled investigations underway... I also understood that... that was what the FBI was doing... that the FBI… I think her objective was to say as little as possible in as many words as possible. I really don't remember. I... I don't remember... I... I don't know... I don't personally remember it. Throughout the investigation of the 9/11 Commission, what you saw of Condoleezza Rice, it appeared to many people certainly on the Commission was a tremendous amount of word play. You know, a warning was not a warning, intelligence wasn't intelligence unless she said it was. She relies on this word-play to the point of being dishonest. This study has found that you, Madam Secretary, made 56 false statements to the American people. Isn't it true that you had intelligence that cast doubt on your repeated claims that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction? I did not at any time make a statement that I knew to be false or that I thought to be false in order to pump up anything. We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud. None of the intelligence community said that he had a nuclear bomb. That's really going a long way with that talking point when you're suggesting to the American people that it might go off tomorrow morning. I do believe in Rice's mind she doesn't believe she lied. I believe that. I believe that she believes that, you know, she did what she had to do and if she kept some things, uh, strategically absent from the public record, I think that's how she would see it. I think she would see that that's what she had to do. She walked in with all the credentials for having principles, and in the process of joining that unholy alliance for the crusade in Iraq, I think she rose above principle. Stop telling the same lies Stop making the world cry Be who you are inside I'm a deeply religious person. My life has I think unfolded as it was supposed to. Let down your guard tonight Say you're sorry cause it's all right We all make mistakes Who pays the price for your decisions? You're not gonna pay a particular price. I want to interview Condoleezza Rice when she was buying Ferragamo shoes on Fifth Avenue and went to see Spamalot when people were drowning. Boy, would I love her to face me. What's a “noble cause”? Tell me as a mother. I want to know. [protesters shouting] Our love, our life, our dreams Believe. Our love… I do pray every day and in times of tragedy and heartbreak like the passing of my own parents or September 11th, I have found solace and strength in the power of prayer. Believe [chatter and gunshots] On September 16, 2007, Blackwater guards who were working for the State Department opened fire in the Central Square in Baghdad. Witnesses say that the guards did this even though the attack was unprovoked. One of the armored cars hit my car so I opened the door and drop myself in the street, because I thought they are-- they wanted to kill me. What resulted in that day was the death of 17 Iraqi civilians. ...I would remind that this is a war zone and that it is true that sometimes, uh, incidents happened. The State Department then offered ten thousand dollars to the families of the victims in exchange for an agreement not to sue. I told them I refused to accept any compensation. First, I want the court system to have the final word. In this war zone I don't think that people - have been either reckless... - [gunshots] Jesus Christ, it's like a fucking turkey shoot. ...Nor have they been trying somehow to shield people in this circumstance. Secretary Rice granted immunity to these contractors for prosecution in the United States. Essentially, pardoned these crimes. The way that the State Department responded to this was to renew a contract with Blackwater. We would like to get appropriate legislation that speaks to the prosecution of civilian contract personnel. Well, I'm the sponsor of the only bill I know in the House that has dealt with this, uh, issue and she nor her staff has ever talked with me or my staff. I think it contradicts our values. It makes us out to be hypocrites. It compromises our mission. It puts our military personnel in jeopardy. People make little distinction between American troops and American private contractors. What if another incident occurs, what if there's another shootout in the middle of Baghdad? This is reckless. All I can see is a dereliction of duty. [music] Virtually any level you'd want to assess this, it's a disaster for our country. [music] [fire crackling] The United States does not permit, tolerate or condone torture under any circumstances. After Abu Ghraib broke, after the photographs shocked the world, the CIA was still pushing for interrogations and the use of torture of specific detainees and this group continued to meet with Condoleezza Rice chairing the group. She sat in the White House with these torture meetings and decided what torture to use on what person. These "enhanced interrogation methods" included waterboarding, fingernail extraction and sleep deprivation. And then the combination of those, how often they could be used, could they be used together with each other, the CIA would come in and give a presentation of what they wanted to do, to the point where they were choreographing the interrogations and the torture from the basement of the White House itself. According to White House insiders, Rice signed off on these techniques by instructing the official, "This is your baby, go do it!" Let me try to be clear, the United States doesn't and can't condone torture. I've talked to other people who've said that there was an effort made to try to keep the president somewhat isolated from these decisions, because they were so concerned about the possibility of the president being impeached someday. They knew that what they were doing was illegal. They knew what they were doing would bring shame to the world if the world found out about it. The United States does not transport and has not transported detainees from one country to another for the purpose of interrogation using torture. If you try to think about American foreign policy and that there are secret sites to which people are sent to be tortured and that there are innocents like Maher Arar who's a Syrian Canadian engineer who was sent to Syria to be tortured in a coffin-sized cell for a year. When I was not being beaten, I was put in a waiting room so that I could hear the screams of other prisoners. The cries of the women still haunt me the most. Torture and conspiracy to commit torture are crimes under U.S. law wherever they may occur in the world. It is a tragic fact that Condoleezza Rice has massively committed war crimes. You can be sitting in your office in the White House or the State Department, and if you're making decisions that are authorizing, ordering, facilitating a crime being committed, you're responsible for that crime. When you work for an administration you do sign on and there is a question of loyalty and then every person has to decide for himself or herself where that line is. You know, how loyal are you before you, you know, blow the whistle. I don't think she ever understood the seriousness of what it meant to become as powerful as she is. If Jesus Christ were speaking to Condi Rice, I think he would say that the idea that you're saving tens of thousands of lives by torturing someone… the one doesn't weigh more than the other. If you do it to the least of these you do it unto Me. [glass shatters] I think John Rice would have been appalled. I think Americans should be appalled that Dr. Rice was sitting there giving the authority to waterboard. “War criminal! Take her to the Hague! I think Josef Korbel would turn over in his grave at what Condoleezza Rice and the Bush administration have done. She has now done real horrors. [Explosion] When I first saw you, You slipped into my dreams, Too pure, I melted for you, I screamed and I fought for you Thought everything you told me was true Now I see what's really real She’s a liar, a cheater, a two-faced deceiver, I saw what she did, yet I still believed her. Now it's time to pay the price Stand up and be judged Sentenced by your fears Accused by all the drowning ones It's time to pay the price Pay the price! Pay the price! Pay the price! Pay the priiiiiice! Pay up! [music] What did you expect, honey? I feel like a fool. You were, uh... You were trying to tell me something and I didn't, uh, I didn't pay attention. You have greatness in you and you will bounce back and you have a lot of love to cushion this fall of yours. That's what families are for. Families and friends. I wish I was there helping, uh, put up the tree with you right now. I wish you were too, honey, with your little red Santa hat. Thank you, Mom. I love you, honey. - I love you too. - Take care of that cold. It sounds awful. Yep. I will. I'm gonna take some NyQuil. Okay, sweetheart. I love you. Bye-bye. Love you too. Bye-bye. God. I'm such a pussy. [music] [music] [music] It is a trail of tears that Condi has left behind. [music] She would have served the American people, uh, better if she had challenged the man she worked for. I think far more likely to be on her tombstone would be “corporate interests first, people second”. Her Shakespearean fault was this ambition for Power. I have no regrets. The only thing that I would have regretted is if we hadn't tried to help give people a chance at a better life. [music] [music] Here it is. It's the first song that I wrote since I got back. [piano] Don't worry about me, I'm good, and I won't worry about you either; I did the best I could, I tried but couldn't please her, drifting, turning, slipping, burning; thought by now it’d stop... You'd catch me, right? Yeah. Well, I'll hold you. Thanks. As she gets older she's gonna really realize there's some things that she missed in life. I have tried, all my life to leave it behind but something always turns out there to make me... We're headed back to Stanford to a wonderful life in California. nothing in my bed except my broken grin When silver’s only second best, you realize that maybe this time... She chose Power over Love. I might be golden He's gonna win her, win her, win her When he’s thinner, thinner, thinner Gonna win her, win her, win her When he is thinner, thinner, thinner He's gonna win her, win her, win her When he is thinner, thinner. Yo, I wanna see some sweat. Oh, you gonna see sweat, baby. You want love, you got to sweat for love. Love costs. And this is where you start paying. Condi, me, Condi and me. You've got the body of a lady my age. I'm a little over 50. [chuckles] Aren't you just... I don't care. He's gonna win her, win her, win her When he is thinner... I'm a really avid sports fan. [enthusiastic shouting] And I took up golf a couple of years ago, so I'm really excited about that. [music] Look at the smile on his fucking face. He's gonna win her, win her, win her When he is thinner... No breakfast, lunch, not even dinner You'll settle for that, just a measly snack High five... Yeah. If that would make Condi yours, yours, yours [celebration and cheering] - Condi! - Yes! Goal! [chuckles] [music] [music] Oh, Condi, Condi, I'm begging on my knees Open up your heart And let me in, won't you please? Got no money but everybody knows I love you, Condi, And I'd never let you go Sweet and dandy pretty as can be You be the flower and I'll be the bumblebee Oh, she loves me, Oops, she loves me not People say you're cold but I think you're hot Oh, Condi, Condi, Oh, Condi, Condi, [music] Oh, Condi, Condi, Oh, Condi, Condi, Oh, Condi, Condi, I'm talking to you, girl What's it gonna hurt, come on give me a whirl Shake your body and let me see you go One time, my Condi, I love you so…
