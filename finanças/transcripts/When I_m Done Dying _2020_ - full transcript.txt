Don't be stupid. Brother, can you give me- Go to sleep. Thanks a lot bro. Of course bro, anytime. Glad you told me you needed bonzai. I get scared of smoking this shit alone. Did you put plenty? I did, bro. Don't worry, I won't tell Yunus. Thanks. You can go on. When I'm Done Dying Yunus! What happened? A drunkard messed with me. Is it gonna need stitches? It should be fine. I wish I didn't go out tonight. Couldn't sleep. Did you lock the door? I'm uploading this? Yep. Say, new song is on the way. Coming soon. New... song... is on the way. 'You guys are on fire', 'You are great' U guys rappers or models? We want new songs not pictures. My ass. Like he does any shit himself. We gotta save up for the studio man. Spend less money, eat less. Let's upload the song as is. I think it's dope. We can remix later when we make the album. I'm left in the dark, no light on the streets My mind is restless, in the claws of the night Wasn't easy to survive in this hood, but it defined me I could have lived an ordinary life and chilled But I woke up to nightmares all the time Kids poisoned themselves on holiday mornings They collected bonzai instead of sweets Take, take, take one more inhale It's up to you who you become tomorrow Hold on to words or you'll fall into the abyss If you burn with me here you'll get to like hell Hey. Hey. I'm Fehmi. Devin. I can take these. You don't bother at all, I got it. No, it's ok. Is it your first time around here? This way. Your friend is donating these books for nothing. Our kiddos are no nerds. She's so stubborn. I couldn't say no. You tired? Nope. Islam is the right path. My boys. Fehmi brother, who is she? What's cooking? She brought books to your sister. Efe, you guys take these home. Come on get going. Do you want to stick around a bit? I'll introduce you to my band-mate. When we become famous, you'll have a story to brag. Bro, it looks amazing. Yeah? Go over, I'll take a photo. Yo, isn't it great? We should get a nice photo in front of it. Good work, bro! Listen to this! If Tupac knew my rhymes are so mind-blowing, he'd get up from his grave and come running. He'd cut my tongue with hurry, a rival like me would give him mad worry. You call yourself a rapper? Man, he thinks he's as good as Tupac. Is it true, that his band mates smoked his ashes with weed? Wow, you know. Imagine the lyrics you can write with a Tupac high! Don't talk like that. Allah will strike us! Look at the guy, he's struck by Allah already. Hi. We didn't get to meet. I'm Alper. Devin. Fist bump, fist bump! Are you from around here? She's my guest. You here to make a documentary? No. So, what do you do? I make music too. I mean, I used to. Really? What kind of music? Electronic. Interesting. Play something for us. What have you got? Come on, come on, come on. Something jolly. Something jolly... Nice intro. Cool. It's like a rap beat. -You could rap over this. -Yeah. I don't sing for free normally. Welcome to my hood This is Karaçınar Never miss a beat, this is Fehmi indeed I have no fancy clothes, all I got is dirt and rust Rap is my destiny, it will be my legacy Don't drift, open your eyes wide Not the dreams but the truth is Karaçınar Our streets lead to nowhere, dreams are locked up On a short leash, it's hard to get far But I got the flow I'm ill, Just sit back and chill Hip-hop is a tough pursuit but easy is not my way The day will come when I'll tour these streets with my own car The blood in my veins runs wild Homie, here I can make you suffer All I got is the pen in my hand, I write for the world to understand This is Karaçınar, this is my family If you can't deal with it, just go eat my treat Cheers! Wait, that wasn't good. One more time. Ready? Three, two, one! Nice. I don't mind the bad review. I just don't want my music to be mislabeled as avant garde. Who cares, you're featured on ravermag. Whatever. Devin, can I borrow your midi controller? Mine is in repair. You're not using it anyway, right? Sorry, I can't. But the consonant sounds won't have the same effect in a different country. True. Can't believe I didn't think of this before. I think you've spent too much time on this project. Try and get clean, aren't you done dying This will last till the end... We started a fire. I started. This will last till the end. I started a fire. I started a fire! On fire! The song is gonna be like a snake(great)! It's gonna be a kickass song. Let's finish the chorus. We can shoot a music video in front of fire barrells. Excuse me. Sorry to keep you waiting. Bon apetit. What are you laughing at? We want to thank Ramo brother for this opportunity. Are y'all ready? Yes! I can't hear you! Yes! Alright then let's begin. We ripped off this beat from DP, I hope he'll forgive us. Fell asleep on the counter Cops in front of the shop Kids get high on glue Come on chief we are guilty Bonzai in the playground It's free and it's plenty When the death trip comes, it makes everything seem freaky Evil twines your dreams, everyone clenches teeth They holler from all corners, under the infulence of many things My wallet is empty but my mind is full I can find the way without a penny If you point us it will cost you an arm, in my hood all roads lead to harm Prison bars are destiny Hunger is the enemy All eyes are fixed on us, they see us as junkies When the future unravels, maybe eyes will fill with tears My life is on a thin thread, maybe it's gonna break apart Believe, it will be right, everything will be alright Against odds, despite fate, everything will be alright Believe, believe, believe, believe Everything will be alright Against odds, despite fate, everything will be alright Thank you! Your hands are so small. Look at mine. Mine is the size of your face. I need to go. You can stay, until the morning. I have to go to work. They are waiting for me. At this hour? Interesting. You don't believe me? Nope. For real. Don't worry, there is no other chick(chicken) waiting for me. Chicken? Just joking around. Chicken. Ok then. Is this your place? It was my Grandpa's. Does it look good on me? What about your parents? What about your parents? That's not why I asked. Weren't you running late? Yes. Do you mind giving me some cab money? Sure. Would that be enough? Yes. Thanks. The best brother of all brothers! Where have you been? I have to wake up at 8 am. Sorry bro. The concert started late. It's over. I'm done covering for you. Don't care if you get fired. Can't work 20 hours a day. Come on bro, give me some credit. I'm not fooling around. Rap is my job too. Job huh? That's a hobby. Do you make money rapping? No. Not yet maybe, but soon I will. Yeah, yeah. Same story for two years. Wait. Give me your phone. Give it to me brother. We uploaded a new song last week. Seventeen thousand views. In just a week. Wow. Pretty cool. Let me show you something too. What do you think? What's this bro? It has three million views. That's how it works right? You are so annoying. Such a killjoy. I'm not annoying, just realistic. Got it? I'm taking off. Bro. You two are around a lot. People are talking. Be careful. Are you worried about me or your charisma? Mind your own business. -How is it? -Looks pretty good. Yeah. I did a minimal version, but I'm working on it. Actaully I think it looks the same. He's coming by the way. Don't get me wrong but, if you want something just for fun... he might not handle that well. He's fragile. Okay, understood. What's up. Hey there. Birds told me you came here. Are you ready? So you like my spot? Thanks for the beers. Cheers. Sometimes Yunus and I write lyrics here. It's an inspiring view. I totally agree. I love your smell. My perfume? No. I'm talking about you. The smell of your skin. So will you come to Timur's concert? I don't know. Why don't you play? Fuck. What's wrong with him? Ömer? You know him? Yeah. We should take him to the hospital. No, that'll get him in trouble. -He's on bonzai. -What if he dies here? You go, I'll stay with him. Don't worry. He's been like this before, he'll be alright. Don't you watch the news. People die from this you know right? I promise to take him to the hospital if he gets worse Okay? Bon apetit. I got it, you always put too much. That's enough for me. That much only? You are a man, have some more. I'm good Pa, gotta watch the belly. Thanks. I had a chat with the new girl at the grocery store today. I liked her a lot. Yeah Dad, I know her too. She's real sweet. Have you seen the girl Erdem? Yes, I know her. Give me my phone back. Texting at dinner like degenarate kids. You'll kill the battery. But it's very important. Allah alllah. Erdem. Why don't you do the groceries tomorrow? Chat with her a little. Maybe you'll like her? She's not my type. For years, you've been finding excuses for everyone. All the girls in the hood adore you. Why can't you like girls? Thanks for dinner. Give it to me. I need to send- Son, don't be like your brother okay? God forbid, dad. I hope he won't be like me! I work like a dog, day and night. When this drunkard fools around, I cover his shift, so they don't fire him. Because I'm a fool. I work 20 hours because I'm a fool. Please, don't ever be like me, ok? Fehmi. Mr. handsome. Wake up, it's late. Come on. Get up. Come on. Come. We'll tell dad that you had too much to drink. I don't want to give him a stroke. You get your shit together. Okay. You're going to find a day job. I want you home by my side at night. Aren't you hanging out with Ali at night? What about that? Why did you ask for me so urgently? Open the top drawer. Open it. I marked all the job listings in red. You'll call all those numbers today. No whining. I'll check the call history tonight. There are no minutes on the phone. Of course. It's my last money. Don't fritter it away. Ok brother. Dance a little. Is he hitting on you? What? What's going on between you two? He is smiling at you, you smile back. What do you want me to do? Just give him a cold stare? I think you can keep a distance, or he'll think you're flirting. Fehmi, we've been friends since middle school. What should I do? Not talk to him? Actually I'd prefer if you didn't talk to other men. Don't get me wrong. It's not about you. It's just that, men can't be trusted. What is that supposed to mean? You only need to trust me, not other men. I can manage if someone crosses the line. I am going back in. Are you coming? It's disrespectful to Timur. Okay, your call. Let's wait till it's over. Come, take a drag. One puff would do it for you. What are you doing? They don't want your weed bro. We give them bonzai with Fehmi. Right Fehmi? Are you okay? Are you smoking bonzai? No. Then why did Zehra say that? She was smoking, I was just with her. I don't do it. You are overreacting, Devin. This is not overreacting. People die from this in even once. You know right? Like I said, I got nothing to do with that stuff. Don't worry. Don't you worry about Zehra at all? I am worried. Her parents will set her up to marry a random dude soon. That's what I am worried about. Here, people die when they are alive too. You don't know. Haven't you done some drugs too anyway? I bet your friends know this stuff better. But Fehmi, it's not the same thing with bonzai. Alright, I'm telling you. It's cool. For real. I'm not doing it. Do you want to hear a terrible joke? -Go ahead. -Yeah? All pigeons are actually rappers. Why? Because they walk like this. Idiot. What? Bro, you're not gonna believe who just called. No way you can guess. Who called? Faruk Ünal. You mean the famous Faruk Ünal? Yes, 'the' Faruk Ünal. Will he put you on his talent show? No man. He wants to produce a rap album. He asked about our other songs. I said we have it all ready. He wants to see us in the studio this weekend, to hear all the songs. My god! Is the album finally gonna come out? Finally bro, finally. But your songs aren't ready. Why didn't you ask for some time bro? Cuz when you find an opportunity like this you gotta jump on it. If I asked for time, he could change his mind later and we'd be fucked. Right. I know what I am talking about. So where are you at with the songs? Two songs have rip off beats. One needs to be recorded. We don't have money for the studio. I can do it. For real? I have equipment too, we can record it. At your place? Yeah, the intro is too long. Do you think we should shorten it? I think that'll be better for the rhyme. How's it going? Almost done. I'll wrap up in a bit and play it to you. Alright let's check the end again. We were going to increase the base. Guys you are both saying the same thing. Come sing over the new beat. Let's see how it works. It's gonna be amazing! Seriously guys, great job! Good job, Devin! Fehmi? It's okay. Let's talk. Put it out. You can't smoke that. Look at me. I'm sorry. Why did you lie to me? You didn't mind Timur snorting coke... ... or Azra popping ex. What's the problem? Is Bonzai too trashy for your bourgeoise ass? You have no idea what I've been through. I don't want to lose someone I love again Fehmi. Let's finish the songs professionaly. We'll talk later. How long have you been doing it? Two years. On and off. I quit but start again. Why do you start again? Is there a certain reason? Do you start when you're down, or when you're in the mood? I don't know Devin. I'm asking because, I feel very happy with you. Aren't you happy? I am. I'm very happy. What is your problem then? What more do you want? Okay. Let me prove myself to you. Please. Promise? Promise. Promise? Promise. Hip-hop rescue us, the streets are full of lies Soul flows throug the mic, it's the only salvation in life They didn't stop this fire, flames are growing bigger They didn't stop this fire, the flames are all over Education on the streets beats your college degrees You frame and hang those bullshit degrees We got itches, bruises and fights, all day all night Our school is called pain, we tasted all sorts of it We kept going, never feared the end of it The path was dark ahead, but didn't step back We never worshipped anything but rap They say it's devil's music, we didn't give a crap Very good, boys. Very good. You have a unique style. The lyrics are moving. We actually recorded these at home with limited equipment. If we did a decent recording I think it'd turn out better. Yeah we can do much better. That doesn't matter. You can re-record anytime. Your work has soul in it. Go to the best studio, but if you don't have that soul... ...your work will be piece of trash. Exactly, soul is important for us. Yes, very important. We talk about our hood and our life. About Karaçınar. I say let's do a studio session next week and play around. What do you say? Maybe we can even release your first album. Enough with the dumb jokes man. You look so ugly in pictures! We'll make the album! Should have taken a picture of that. De Hakikat. Yo Yunus! Devin will join the band from now on. We changed the name to De Hakikat. You're even bigger losers now. Alright, I'm taking off. You're awake. Sit down. What's going on? Why did you take my phone if you were going to keep it off? The battery died Pa. That phone is only for when he wants to reach us. Tell me, what's going on? He has no clue. You've stolen from the deli. They asked our father to pay it back. I didn't steal that money, I just borrowed it. I didn't get to tell the boss yet. I couldn't go to work since. You're a disgrace. I swear, with my next salary, was going to- Which next salary? You're fired already. They said you haven't showed up for days. But I texted you. And I texted back, said I'm done covering your ass. Haven't you read? Anyway, I don't need that job anymore. I'm gonna bring a lot of cash home soon. Faruk Ünal is going to produce our album. We prepped the songs, stayed up all night. Then we went to his studio. He digged the songs big time. Don't worry about the deli job. Couldn't you find a more believeable lie? You don't believe me? Of course I don't. Look at yourself. What's Faruk gonna do with someone like you? Fehmi. Don't bring shame on us. That's all I want from you, son. What's wrong with you bro? Nothing. Having problems with your chick? Is it the rich girl, poor boy tragedy? I said nothing. Allah allah. Leave him alone. Don't mind them Fehmi. Zehra can you give me some of your bonzai? I want to be alone. Let me see. But what about tomorrow? Don't start with me Zehra, I'm in a bad mood. We lost eight lives left out of nine Music is the last one that remained I wish I could erase my destiny and rewrite it Don't trust your youth, the streets will suck it out of you The fastest ones among us are now in the coffin But I'll be the king of the city Since the cradle, all I hear are the bullets The birds sing from afar When you have it, it is death When you don't, it's pain We are outcasts for them They holler from all corners, under the infulence of many things My wallet is empty but my mind is full I can find the way without a penny Can I give it one last try? I will nail it this time. I will try one more time. Okay, go for it. They holler from all corners, under the infulence of many things My wallet is empty but my mind is full I can find the way without a penny If you point at us, it'll cost you an arm. In my roads - Let's stop. Fehmi, go wash your face. Get yourself together. We're good for today. Can't believe we've come to this. He'll never work with us. You'll see. We'll never get a chance like this again. It's over. What did he say? The album deal is off. No, he only said we need more time. That means fuck off. He basically said suck my dick. We are good. He can't easily find rappers like us. You think Istanbul consists of Karaçnar? Relax man. There's a shit ton of rappers out there. No one would bother with a junkie like you. Why should they? Yunus you are being a prick. No, you are being a prick. You couldn't get your shit together for fuck's sake. You are going down and you're taking me with you. Then jusy fuck off man. Go do whatever the fuck you want, okay? You're attacking me where you should be apologizing. You've put me through all sorts of shit in the last two years. Did I I ever tell you to fuck off, ha? I didn't. You should have said it. You should have let it out. Is that also my fault now. Whatever man. Fine. Fine. Aren't you going to say something? If I talk now, I'll upset you. I didn't do anything to you? Why are you mad? You promised. Don't do this Devin. I need you on my side right now. I'm going home. You don't even love me. You only care about my rap. Otherwise you'd stay with me now. What are you talking about Fehmi? You call that rap, what you did in there? You're nothing without Yunus. You would never come this far. 'There are no airports in our hood, but everyone is flying high.' Selam Aleykum (Hello). Aleykum selam (Hello). Sorry to bother, but I wanted to ask for something. Sure, no problem. What do you want to buy? Not like that. It's about Fehmi. He's not doing well, he got kicked out of school too. Poor thing. Why are you making fun? You have a brother too, you should understand. We ain't pointing a gun to his head to buy the stuff. Go tame your brother, man. Don't pester us. Why am I trying to reason with you? You're a bunch of scumbags. Watch your mouth! Please don't. We are neighbors in this hood. Fehmi owes me 80 liras. Debt paid. At least give me the 20 lira change. Fuck off. Get the fuck out. Don't come here again. Tell that cop friend of yours, he's not welcome either. You hear? God knows what he is. Faggot. You didn't have to come. I'm okay. Don't worry. You wanted him to quit the night job anyway. But not like this. People will talk behind our back, they'll call us thieves. Dad will start working again, but he needs to rest. All this shit. Welcome. How much will you pay for this phone? I can give you 50. What's wrong bro? Just give me the money. I want three packs. If your brother asks, you're not getting these from me, OK? Deal? Yeah okay man. Good. Here. Over here. Look at yourself. You fucked it all up. You're gonna be a rapper ha? Same story two years. You're nothing without Yunus. You would never come this far. You know it too. You know it. Fuck you. Prick. Fuck off. Don't laugh. Call an ambulance. You're fine bro. It's no big deal. What are you doing? -It's just a video man. -Fuck off. Hey, hey, it's okay. Calm down. It's just a bad trip. Look at me, you're going to be alright. Yunus, call an ambulance. Easy bro, you're tripping, you're fine. It'll be over, just chill. Easy, easy. It's over. You need to go see your brother. I'm sorry brother. I'm sorry. What have you done, you son of a bitch? What did you want from my brother? Fehmi, don't mess with them. Fehmi, calm down. You think you can beat me up? Who do you think you are? Fuck off! It's okay guys. I fucked it all up. His fans were crying during the concerts. He says, he was moved by that. During the tour, J Dilla was going to the hospital for dialysis every morning. Are you okay? It's starting again. Some food maybe? Play it. It keeps my mind busy. He was tenacious, he never gave up. He went on that stage every single night. He says Dilla was truly a warrior. Devin, you go to sleep. I think I'll go back to the hood. Why? Can't sleep like this. Don't want to bother you. Alright, I'll stay up with you. You don't understand. It's getting worse. Maybe it'll help, even if it's just one puff. Then what? You'll feel like this again after. I think it's more realistic to quit slowly. Don't fool yourself. Remember what you said this morning. Hang on. Don't. Okay. Fuck you Devin. What's going on Fehmi? I heard what you said. What did I say? You said his name. Whose name did I say? You said Timur. What? You said don't, and I said okay to you. You said Timur, I heard it. Fehmi, you said don't do it and I said okay. You said Timur. You're full of shit. What are you doing? Don't go. Devin, move. Fehmi, listen to me. You'll regret this later. I don't want your advice, cunt. Swear all you want. I don't care. I'm with you. I don't want you with me. I don't want you. You're gonna get over this Fehmi. -I don't want to. -But you promised. You promised, Fehmi. -I take it back. -No, no! You can't help me. Move. Leave some for us too man. Is he going to peg out? You fuckers gave him too much. I don't want him to die in my house. Take him out. Forgive us bro. Isn't he your boy? Son. Wake up, son. Get some water! Are you alright son? Get up son. Come on. Are you alright? I will be. You will. I promise. I'll be good. You will. The phone rang. It's an unknown number. 'Am I speaking to Mr. Yunus?' Mr? 'We are calling from Grand Hip-hop Fest'. We'd like to invite your band Hakikat to join'. This is like a miracle, for us to sing at such a big festival. You know this too. Yes. I'm so happy for you. But, you can do the concert without me. Any DJ would do. Devin look... Fehmi needs you. Go for it bro. Karaçınar 2015. Spit it. Kids don't have a fair start to life in my hood Trust me, they were never asked to choose Or they would never prefer to deal drugs Over going to school like other kids When a family struggles to survive for the day Childhood is no bed of roses Deep down they are truly naive Can't tell a dealer from a teacher They got lost, and missed the way out Had no choice and drugs were the remedy That remedy became the enemy This curse was impossible to escape We made it a habit to blind our eyes, surrendering to pain and bitterness Instead of facing the reality of this life It's better to zone out and benumb the mind Are you still mad at me? I'm not mad, I'm sad. I want to get my shit together this time. For real. Maybe you won't believe me anymore. But everyone will see in time. I still believe in you. Yes, bro, it was lost. Let me keep it. Maybe I will wear it to the concert tomorrow. Yunus you always do this man. Believe, it'll work out, everything will be alright. Against odds, despite fate, everything will be alright. Believe, believe, believe, believe Everything will be alright. Against odds, despite fate, everything will be alright. Bro, they saw Faruk's assistant in the VIP. Yeah, let's do this. Are you okay? Yes. The gang is here. I'll check on them. You need anything? I will feel better once on stage. Don't worry. If you say so. Dude, they're saying it's packed. I'll roll one just in case. You're gonna smoke? Just one drag maybe. Wanna share? I'm good bro, thanks. I'm gonna run to the bathroom. Are you okay? Are you okay Fehmi? Get up, get up. What did you do? Nothing. What did you do Fehmi? Get up. What's going on? Look at me. What have you done? I chilled a bit. I see. You're chill as fuck. Can't stand straight. You are my curse, you fucking idiot. Easy man. Fuck you, calm ha? You can't go on stage like this. I can. You can't. -I will. -No, you can't. I'll take you to the stage now, are you ready? Batu, you know the lyrics, you'll go on stage. Stop it. No Yunus! There'll be a change. It's gonna be us two, ok? I can sing Yunus. You don't know what you're saying. It's my song. You can't do this. Hey. What's going on here? You can't do this to me. It's my song. What are you doing? Devin, we can't do this without you. I need you to stay. Please. Not outside, not at home Can't find peace anywhere Like a gem, it's so hard to find Pop a pill, go chill, never mind Can't do no sacrifice You see yourself as flawless You're selfish, I never get you Try to see things my way Pieces of this puzzle, didn't fit sadly I'm heartbroken cause you never believed in me I walk around like a ghost You killed me with your bare hands The hospital corridors are dark There's no turning back Can't stand being by myself My past is full of scars Greed is my only true friend Yunus is a beast on stage Chaos at home, chaos in streets, tired of this shit Dreams are high but my path is uphill Can't get to the plains. No! No! I can't save anyone I'm fighting for my own life Nobody gives a hand, nobody cares I don't want your help anyway Clean yourself up, I'm done dying I'll hang on till the last day of my life I started a fire Started a fire We already started a fire No answer? Keep it. She'll get back to you. But of course you need to keep working. You need to improve your skills. I see a big potential in you. ...I can see you becoming a big name in five years... I hope you keep doing this. Keep going! Hey. Hi. How are you? I'm okay. You? I'm good. I could have come to the hood too. No problem. It's a change of scenery for me. Haven't left the hood in a while. I took my brother's job. I've been living back and forth between home and work. How are you doing? Just working, not much. You're looking good. I've been clean for five weeks. If that's what you're asking. Really? I've been thinking of you all the time. You are always on my mind. But you never answered my calls. Don't. Why did you want to meet? I wrote a beat for you. Maybe you'll use it for one of your new songs. Thanks. But I'm not sure if I'll get back at it. You can give it to someone else if you want. No. Keep it. Maybe you'll change your mind. Take care. Calling out from the bottom of hell, what's next for me I can't tell Why does all the paths I take, lead to a freefall? I'm drowning in my thoughts, gotta run and chase my dreams I'm on an endless journey, from this curse i need to break free Even if I'm all alone, I'll make it to the plains I fell and I couldn't hold onto you, didn't hold onto you I have no fear in me, I'm gonna make it I survived dark nights all by myself Exhiled from my hood, estranged from my family The razzle was a trap, but now I do get by I'll throw the weight off my shoulders Will sing to thousands, those days are gonna come Will smile from the stage and strike a pose My final words are yet to come
