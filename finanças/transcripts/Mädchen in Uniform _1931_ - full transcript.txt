Haven't we been announced? I am Fr?ulein von Kesten. Please, don't get up, Your Excellency I'll take a seat too. Please I am afraid to say that the Headmistress is indisposed at present I'm so sorry She regrets very much not being able to welcome you herself Please, tell the Headmistress that I also regret it very much I wanted to introduce our little niece myself Manuela, make a curtsey How do you do? ? Well, you're pretty big for fourteen. ? Fourteen and a half How is her education progressing? Her education so far could have been better She's almost an orphan My brother-in-law is certainly a good man But you know what army officers are like They don't understand about educating young girls Unfortunately, my poor sister died too soon She's overly sensitive... ...and a bit of a scatterbrain. ? There, there, now There's no harm in a few tears. You'll get over it Manuela, pull yourself together An officer's daughter crying! Hey! You can't go up there ? Why not? ? Come down. It's forbidden Hello I am Margo von Rasso. I'm to look after you So, Manuela... Chin up now. Make your father proud of you Work hard and do as you're told. I want you to get good results Don't spoil my plans for your future ? Do you promise? ? Of course, Aunt Give me a kiss then Adieu, Fr?ulein von Kesten. ? Goodbye, Your Excellency Thank you for everything you will do for the child Do well, Manuela Come on. This way The main stairs are only for the Headmistress and guests First, we'll get your uniform. The wardrobe mistress is expecting you It's on the fourth floor. I'll show you the ropes But you must do things for me too. ? Yes, Marga In the morning you'll bring me water for washing That's just the under class "And everyone shouts as loud as they can: "When do we eat?" "And everyone shouts as loud as they can: "When do we eat?" I'm hungry as a hunter That's the new girl ? I'm Oda von Oldensleben. ? I'm Barbara von Beckendorf I'm Ilse von Treischke. Do you know what dormitory you're in? Marga says I'm in Fr?ulein von Bernburg's So am I. Be careful you don't fall in love Why? Because all the girls have a crush on Fr?ulein von Bernburg God! I can't bear to listen to it "Ilse, how I envy you! You're in her dormitory "Oh God, oh God "Tell me, is it true that she kisses you at night?" I've had lots of weird governesses I didn't pay attention to them. ? It's funny with her You never know how to take her One minute she looks at you terribly Then, all of a sudden, she's very kind She's really strange, that Bernburg Ilse, you shouldn't call her just Bernburg Ah, be glad I don't call her the Golden One Manuela, where have you been? Come with me Nice girl, isn't she? Ah, there you are. Come in here. Come here So you're No. 124. Come on, get undressed ? What are you doing with my dress? ? Keep quiet, little one In five weeks, if you behave, you'll have a day out Then you'll get your clothes back. Now come over here Come here, sit on this chair Now for your hair Oh please, don't do that It is the rules. The hair must be plaited tightly ? It hurts. ? You will get used to it ? Oh, those hairpins! ? It's the rules, too. Soon you won't notice it Come with me. We'll put on your dress It is too long. We have to pin it up ? Someone's worn this before. ? Of course, what do you think? A new dress for each girl wouldn't be economical... ...says Fr?ulein von Kesten. No, no, we are not that generous When a girl leaves, her dress is handed on until it's worn out Look, what does this mean? A heart and the letters "E. v. B." This means Elisabeth von Bernburg The girl who wore that dress before... ...must have been infatuated with Fr?ulein von Bernburg So, you are the new girl? Show me how you look All right Now turn around Your hair needs to be tidier Why are you shivering? Are you nervous? No That's good Manuela, I demand total discipline You must notify me before leaving the dormitory Talking while dressing and undressing is strictly forbidden Is that clear? Good. You may go to the others This is your cupboard. The key's there, open it Books? They are forbidden. You must give them to me Why? ? Have you any money? ? Some Give it to me ? Why's that? ? It's not allowed. They keep it for you Come over here Grand, eh? Mia stuck up a picture of Henny Porten But I've got Hans Albers And he's got a lot of... What's it called? What do they call what all the movie stars have? Sex appeal? Yes, he's got that ? Chocolate? Have to give it up. ? But I... ? No buts. Rules are rules. ? Heavens, Marga, don't be like that! It's nothing to do with you. I'm in charge of the new girl My name's Edelgard Can I help you? Yes, please What's that book? ? I was going to read it on the journey It's from my Uncle's library. I haven't read it yet Wow! This is great ? You must give it to me. ? No, I must not It's my book! ? What's all this? Marga! ? Yes, Fr?ulein von Kesten ? Something forbidden? ? Yes, Fr?ulein von Kesten Take these things away Meinhardis, come here I keep my good and bad marks in here If anything forbidden is found in your cupboard, you get a black mark If you get more than five black marks in four weeks, you're not allowed out So... watch out Dismissed! Here are the bills, Headmistress Headmistress, please You must reduce expenses. They are too high Yes, Headmistress. We do our best The children are already complaining of hunger Hunger? We Prussians know how to hunger. They are children of soldiers And God willing, mothers of soldiers too What they need is discipline, not a life of luxury ? How true, Headmistress, how true. ? Poverty is no sin It enobles. This is the true meaning of Prussianism as it once was Let the others gorge themselves. They'll be sorry What I like best is stuffed roast hare Our cook makes a big coffee cake with a crumble topping this thick Eclairs with whipped cream are even better Through discipline and hunger, hunger and discipline... ...we shall be great again. Or not at all! My Mother wrote that they've been slaughtering on the farm Oh, why can't she send me a ham? Nobody must have more than anyone else But if she just sent a whole ham? Some girls' parents aren't well off any more I'd give them some I wouldn't eat it all myself Why scrape so much butter off? Don't blame me, there's only half a pound for fifty girls The girls are as meek as lambs They daren't complain about anything Everything is discipline and order here Line up! Hurry up The little Meinhardis, Headmistress Well, well Get ready for the prayers. March forward! Closer! Forward! Closer We'll sing the first verse of the hymn "So take my hand" "So take my hand "And lead me on "To my joyful end "For all eternity "I wish not to walk alone "A single step of the way "Where You will both go and stay "I'll be by Your side" I ask you to raise your hearts and hands, to repent your sins, acknowledge the errors of your ways, and beg forgiveness of your Father in Heaven. ? Amen I have something further to say It has reached my ears that certain rules are being disobeyed Letters are being sent without prior approval... ...with unfounded complaints about the school Staff will report any further incidents to me The first culprit will be severely punished Days out will be cancelled and wearing uniform forbidden Own clothes will have to be worn when walking through town Just imagine her naked You have been warned I wouldn't send my children to a boarding school Would you? ? I'd have to think about it That's the infantry That's the cavalry Girls, come here a minute Look, what Marie can do Come here, Marie. Watch! Come on, Marie. ? Leave me alone. You're always laughing at me No, no. Just take a deep breath What a body! Quiet! What's all this noise? Edelgard! What are you doing? We were talking of Manuela's mother She died a long time ago. Manuela told me about her Go and wash You have no mother? No. Otherwise I wouldn't be here Come now. Is that so terrible? Come here Don't tell yourself it's awful here It's still strange to you You don't know the other girls yet But you mustn't think you'll always be unhappy Listen to me. You must tell yourself... ...that you'll be very happy here Pray to God every night and ask Him to help you Will you promise me? See what a reasonable girl you are Now go to bed. I'll come back to say goodnight Watch! "It has reached my ears... "...that certain rules are being disobeyed" "You have been warned" Quiet! Everybody to bed ? Well, are you all ready? ? Yes, Fr?ulein von Bernburg Gives each one a smacker Wonderful! Watch, Manuela. It's my turn next Step, step, step! Hey, Josi Bleicher has a crush on me. Listen... "Dearest, sweetest Mia... "Let me be with you and sit near you at table "From your loving, little Josi" What's that note? Show me Hurry up. I'm waiting I'm not interested in your silly games Throw it in the basket and remember, once and for all: writing notes is strictly forbidden. ? Thank you! That was awfully nice of Fr?ulein von Bernburg She is always so decent I try to be a friend to the children ? On equal terms? ? Why not? How do you maintain authority? You are their superior and must keep your distance We must awaken the children's ambition Excellent, Fr?ulein von Attems Affinity has no place here That might lead to emotionalism Always love! Discipline is the main thing The German classics must be cultivated Fr?ulein von Bernburg, I have noticed... ...that you give very few black marks I've no need to punish the children, they obey me and learn well Indeed! And Manuela von Meinhardis? Yes... she doesn't do well. But that will change I find her charming. And she does her work superbly Oh, Manuela is so ladylike. She learns excellently with me She prepares my lessons better than the other girls So far, although I say it myself... ...the results of my teaching have always been good Yes, exceptionally good Ladies, please! Yes, we know that. And we appreciate it But please, do not try to exceed your duties Certainly not But the children must trust us Sit down So... "Jacob was in a strange land with his father-in-law Laban... "... and wanted to return to Canaan with his wives Rachel and Lea and his children" Who wants to tell the story? "Jacob lifted up his eyes and behold, Esau came" He was his brother. "Of his many wives... "... the most beautiful one was Rachel, and with little Joseph and Benjamin... "... he put her behind him." ? Why behind him? Because he was afraid. He'd given Esau some red pottage... ...and feared he might still be angry "And the sheep he put in front "Esau approached and warmly embraced him "Then Jacob rejoiced" That's very nice. Be seated How is our work for today? Edelgard, first verse "Oh, that I had a thousand tongues and a thousand mouths "Then would I use them all to sing from the depths of my heart "Praises for all eternity "Of what God has done for me" Well done, sit down Manuela, second verse "Oh, that my voice would carry... "to... "to..." Unprepared again Edelgard, this is too terrible I really learned it well, but in front of Fr?ulein von Bernburg... ...I forget everyting Fr?ulein von Bernburg wants to see you I wonder why? I feel sorry for Fr?ulein Manuela Sorry for her? Why, may I ask? She cries a lot at night. Her pillow is always wet through Of course not She must be homesick I won't be able to say a thing. I feel faint Ah, never mind Come in Come here Look at this Tell me, haven't you any new clothes? Where were you before you came here? ? At my aunt's At your aunt's? Full of holes My aunt thought it would do And what do you think? That it won't do I agree, it won't do Perhaps we can find a new petticoat somewhere It may be a bit long, but we can take it up For me? Too good for me. ? Silly child What an emotional girl you are Come Have a good cry. Sit down I'm not unhappy at all I don't know why I'm crying Tell me... Are you homesick? Homesick? No. I just feel like crying sometimes And you don't know why? Or is it something you can't trust me with? I can trust you with everything, but it's hard to say Well, try. I'd really like to know When you say goodnight and leave, and shut the door to your room... ...I stare at the door in the darkness I want to get up and come to you... ...but I know that I can't And I think of when I get older and have to leave the school... ...and every night you will kiss other girls ? What thoughts you have! ? I love you so much! But you're always so distant. I can't ever go to your room and talk to you... ...or hold your hands... ? Well, child, control yourself Don't be a little girl. Be a good comrade You know I can't make exceptions Or the other girls will be jealous I think of you often, Manuela Oh, I am so glad! ? Now, you won't cry anymore? ? No, no more Well, there you are What is it now? May I ask you something? Are you happy? You can't imagine... ...how wonderful it is to live for you children Now just run downstairs to the others. And take your washing with you Thank you so much Girls, another boring Sunday! My mother says I mustn't be weak "The Fatherland needs people of steel" My mother spent four years here, too Has she forgotten how awful it is? How deep it is! Once again Come here, Marga. ? What are you doing? How deep is this hole? Silly, you can test it by the law of gravity ? How do you do it? ? You count the seconds... ...it takes to reach the bottom, then add the acceleration of gravity ? 9.81 Great! I'll try with a firework. ? No, don't! You'll only make a noise Watch, girls! One, two... Girls! Listen to this "Dear Parents, today is another horrid Sunday "Why are we even hungrier on Sundays than on other days? "Please, send me something to eat "Your loving daughter, Ilse" If the Headmistress got hold of that! But she won't. I'm going to smuggle it out Well, children... Isn't it a nice Sunday? ? Yes, very nice Doing good work? Show me Very nice. Also good Show me your stockings, Marie Good Also very good Show me your stocking Good. You'll get a good mark for it Goodbye, children. ?

Goodbye "To celebrate the birthday of our distinguished Headmistress" "Hold, o Queen! "Long was I sunk in a delusive dream "I loved, but now I am at last awake" Oh Manuela, you look so handsome! Do you think she will like me? She must like me. ? Of course Just watch. Today I certainly won't forget my lines! "Hold, o Queen! "Long was I sunk in a delusive dream "I loved, but now I am at last awake" "All alone, Madam?" "Madman!" "With none of your ladies-in-waiting?" "To what rude boldness my indulgence leads!"

Quiet, now comes our scene "Cannot some letters be discovered?" "Truly, an intercepted letter from the prince...

"Soft! Some one comes "'Tis she ? 'tis she herself!" Open it! Give it to me "Why are we even hungrier on Sundays than on other days?" Charming words! Now listen to me Children who lie and smuggle letters... ...cannot be in plays. Take your costume off! I can't be in the play? ? No! Fortunately, the letter was wrongly addressed Your parents have been spared the anguish of an ungrateful child Leave me alone Stop dreaming! "And for the future Carlos stands nearer the throne" No, child. How often do I have to tell you? Don't just speak. Declaim! "And for the future Carlos stands nearer the throne" Oh go. You have no talent, child. Next, please! Posa! Repeat the sentence you always stumble on I know it very well! Good grief, child! "One pen-stroke now, one motion of your hand..." "One pen-stroke now, one motion of your hand..." On your knees! Arms open! ? I thought... ? Don't think, obey! "Grant us liberty of thought," Fr?ulein von Attems! Of course... Little Eboli, come Repeat your sentences "O Carlos, how cruelly you play with me" No, no Here you must bring into play the whole art of feminine seduction Just listen to me. She looks at him and says "O Carlos, how cruelly you play with me" Excuse me, Fr?ulein von Attems, but it's about to start ? Good evening, children. ? Good evening, Headmistress Be seated I will not leave you here, Hans Because of internal difficulties... ...the role of Domingo will be read by Liese von Zieritz "Our pleasant sojourn in Aranjuez Is over now...

"I'll go "I will leave you" Hurry with the lemon Have a taste What a fine punch you've brewed! ? It's a real punch. ? It'll make them tipsy! Know what the Head said? "She has pretty legs, pretty legs" ? What did Fr?ulein von Bernburg say? ? It was strange Bernburg didn't say a single word But she watched you You can't imagine how closely she watched you Now be quiet a moment, children I was quite satisfied with you Manuela, you were very good. Just remember for the next time: better declaiming and less emotion Manuela, I want to tell you You are very talented If you work hard, you could be a very good actress I'm very glad of that, Manuela The children really performed well It's very good exercise for the girls to learn to recite Schiller Nothing is better than the German classics We're grateful to you, Headmistress The children are so lucky to be here in your charge, Headmistress We do our best with the little we have Silence! Your Majesties, Your Highnesses... ...Your Excellencies and so on I am happy that you managed without my assistance... ...to win the applause of the staff and their guests I wish to congratulate you Your helmets, swords and boots were polished to perfection And everything else went well too But it could have been tighter, tighter, tighter! Still, you played your parts well Especially our Don Carlos To your health, Manuela! It tastes vile You Rhine maiden! That punch you brewed is really something Look, I like this stuff Here, take mine I'm quite tipsy Play something else All right. I'll play "Patern" Shall I tell the girls to be quiet? Let them enjoy themselves today Yes, it's good for them to let their hair down Fr?ulein von Kesten, keep an eye on them I was somewhat surprised. Schiller sometimes writes very freely ? I'm so happy! ? Your hurt me What is it? "E. v. B."? Girls! I want to make a speech I love you all! Want to know something? She gave me a present. ? What? A petticoat. I've got it on ? A petticoat? She opened her cupboard and gave me a petticoat I should wear it and think of her No, she didn't actually say that But that's what she must have meant. I'm so happy! Now I know for sure ? she loves me! ? Who? Fr?ulein von Bernburg Nothing else matters. She is there She loves me! I'm not afraid of anything Yes, everyone should know about it! Long live Fr?ulein von Bernburg, beloved by all! Has she gone mad? Long may she live! Scandalous! It was awful to see poor Manuela so drunk You have to drink sometimes From sorrow or worry I understand it very well If it was up to me, I'd expel her immediately Such a child doesn't deserve to be here. ? You are quite right I agree. Her place is in... ? A reform school! ? Quite Edelgard, have you seen Manuela? ? No, I'm not allowed in No one is. ? I don't understand anything at all I would advise you to be more careful Please, no good advise. I'm tired of being careful Ma ch?re, you're not going to jeopardise your prospects... ...because of this child? ? Perhaps I am ? My God, but why? ? Because I can't stand injustice Look out! Hanni, I feel peculiar I can't think straight And my head really hurts Hanni, how did I get here? You were well and truly drunk It was quite a spectacle Aren't you ashamed of yourself? The disgrace! This establishment has never seen such a scandal You are the worst child the school has ever had If you were younger, you'd be spanked Look at me! Look at me, I said! It's hardly creditable You behaved like a street urchin You have brought shame to the school Where is the Headmistress? Those who behave like you should be cursed Your punishment will be decided later You are well aware of what you did to Fr?ulein von Bernburg She'll never forgive you What did I do? There was a phone call for you Her Highness is visiting us this afternoon Manuela must be there. We must be at full strength But she may not speak to the others Hurry with the arrangements. Her Highness is always punctual Yes, Headmistress Always punctual. Of course Girls! Have you heard? The Head says Manuela should be cursed! ? My God, poor Manuela. ? She shouldn't have behaved like that ? Marga, you're always mean to her. ? Shut up! Did you hear the Head ranting and raving? Have you heard about Manuela? ? It's mean! Quiet! What's the matter? Why are you staring at me like that? I have something to say before the Princess arrives A sorry and unprecedented case of insubordination has occurred The Headmistress wished to save you from contact with the culprit But because of the visit an exception is being made Manuela von Meinhardis is coming out of the sickroom The Headmistress puts you on your honour not to associate with her Whoever speaks to her will be punished. Do you understand? The Headmistress asked me to tell you... ...not to speak to Manuela The child must be isolated. ? Really? A boycott? That's never happened before I'll speak to her! Don't... Manuela will get the blame We should tell the Princess That won't help matters She's important. What she says, they do I'll tell her. I don't care! Where is Manuela? Hurry up! Stand still! Her Highness has arrived Good afternoon Good afternoon, Fr?ulein von G?rschner. How are you? ? Thank you, very well Good afternoon, Fr?ulein von Attems. Ah, Fr?ulein von Bernburg How are you? ? Very well, thank you ? Mademoiselle Oeuillet. Comment allez-vous? ? Merci bien, Your Highness This is our new English teacher, Miss Evans ? Miss Evans, how are you? ? Thank you, very well, Your Highness I'm going upstairs to see the presentation Royalty is always beautiful to see ? Don't forget to tell her. ? I intend to You must tell her now Yes, child? What a lovely sight ? so many happy children Without a doubt, Your Highness Beckendorf... ? Yes, my dear. I didn't forget Dear Headmistress, I'd like to see the little Beckendorf Fr?ulein Beckendorf, do you like it here? Yes, of course, you do Meinhardis. ? Yes, what is her name? ? Meinhardis Oh yes, right. Dear Headmistress, the little Meinhardis girl I knew your mother. She was a very devout woman I hope you'll try to be like her. You look very pale I hope she's not ill, dear Headmistress? ? No, not at all, Your Highness What a charming girl She will be the pride of the school Dear Headmistress, I'd like to speak to you about the nursery school ? This way please, Your Highness. ? Goodbye, my ladies Goodbye, children Such a big mouth, and then you said nothing Well, if the Head hadn't been there... ? It's just ridiculous! ? That wasn't the reason. You are a coward Rubbish! I'm too well brought up No, no! If it were not for her Highness' visit... ...I would have expelled Manuela this very day Excuse me, Headmistress, but I see it differently I know Manuela and the others better than you I'm close to the children. I love them And give them my petticoats? Manuela was poorly supplied If a girl hasn't enough clothes, we write to her mother The girl has no mother Edelgard! Come here Come in here Such disobedience! I wouldn't have expected you... ...to disregard the Headmistress' orders so blatantly But... I'm so worried about Manuela! She is so strange Listen to me, Edelgard Your friend isn't worth risking so much for Associating with her only harms you I'm sure your parents would be very upset to know what a girl you are friends with Manuela is not bad! What you call sin, Headmistress... ...I call the great spirit of love which takes a thousand forms At this age young girls need someone to lean on I will speak to Manuela and rid her of her exalted ideas Exalted ideas? Fr?ulein von Bernburg, don't you see... ...that the contact between you and Manuela must be dissolved? I forbid you to speak another word with Manuela ? What is it? ? I'm so sorry... You should be sober by now Dear Fr?ulein von Bernburg... Please, no theatrics Very well Go to my room and wait for me ? Did you see how pale Manuela was? ? Yes. Terrible When she curtsied I thought she'd faint Manuela! Child! What is all this crying for? Pull yourself together Don't be so feeble. Come, sit here Be reasonable now, will you? What you have done you know What you have done to me, you know that too We needn't mention it again You're to be punished You'll be locked away Not like prison... just isolated Manuela, don't be unfair They are treating you mildly You should have been expelled The Headmistress thought for a long time that would be best But for once, mercy has prevailed Fr?ulein von Bernburg Will I be allowed to see you? No, Manuela But you won't abandon me? It's better for you I'm never to see you again? I couldn't live Manuela, what sort of talk is that? You shouldn't think such things, let alone speak them You must be brought to your senses You must be cured whatever it takes Cured? Of what? You should not love me so much Why not? You must go now I must go There's no point in your staying any longer I'm going now Goodbye, dear Fr?ulein von Bernburg I must speak with you You talked to her although I forbade it Yes, I did. I can answer for it I think I maintained the spirit of your order If anything happened to Manuela... ...it would be very unpleasant for the Head Is Manuela with you? Is she hiding? ? This can't go on. ? We must help Manuela! This rebellious spirit comes from you I will not permit revolutionary ideas Not while I am here I won't cling to my post. I know I can't stay here I can't stand by and see children made into scared, helpless creatures You go this way, and we'll go here ? Have you seen her? ? Where can she be? "Our Father which are in Heaven "Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom come "Thy Will be done On Earth as it is in Heaven "Give us this day our daily bread "And forgive us our trespasses As we forgive them who trespass against us "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil "For Thine is the kingdom "The power and the glory "For ever and ever. Amen" ? All I hear is "help her". ? We're talking about a human being! You shall leave the school today Quick, quick Have you all gone mad? What's the matter? What are the children doing here? ? Manuela wanted to throw herself down We must thank God, Headmistress The girls have prevented a tragedy... ...which we both would have regretted all of our lives
