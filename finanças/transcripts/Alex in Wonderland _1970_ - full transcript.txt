"To be or not to be "that is the question. "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind "to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune "or take arms against a sea of troubles "And by opposing, end them, to die.. "...to sleep no more. "And by a sleep, to say we end the heartache.. ...and the thousand something, that flesh is heir to. "'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. "To die...to sleep. "To sleep.. ...perchance to dream, aye, there's the rub." Then he says, when he says perchance to dream he means suddenly, of course, to die, maybe to die as to the same as to sleeping. And if it's sleeping then it's to dream and to.. To dream he doesn't want to do because his head is all full of things. I don't do that. Just a second, "a thousand to suffer," no wait. "A thousand shocks that flesh is heir to." "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? "Thou art more lovely and more temperate. Will you buy me an ice-cream later? Sure. If you have three kinds of food. Three kinds of food, only three kinds of food that you can have for the rest of your life, what three foods would you pick? Potato chips... enchiladas and tacos. You're gonna need a lot of water, sweetheart. Lot of water. - I want to play story. - Huh? - Let's play story. - You wanna begin? Go on. Once upon a time, there's this real scary house and Horace the ghost lived in it. - And what? - Horace the ghost lived in it. - Yes. - And he-he.. So his mother, his mother, one day she.. His mother, one day, ran out of the house, saying "Horace, I've had enough of your ghost thing. I'm going to run into the forest and pick berries." As she went into the forest, she bent over and picked berries. And Horace came along and kicked her and she went straight into the air and she landed in Puerto Vallarta. When she landed in Puerto Vallarta, she said "I should take a plane back." She took a plane back and just then it got hijacked to Cuba. And...and this Cuban man, he says, "Everyone out." And she says... Wait a minute, I got a movie going here. Come on, you have to get out.. - Bye-bye, daddy. - Bye-bye, baby. There we go. Come on. Okay. Alright, let's go. This is my wife. That was my child. This is my bathroom. This is my dog. Around me, you can see a couple of my friends. A lot to live for, huh? Well, I haven't got lung cancer. I hope you don't have. ...make a lot of money. I never heard so much applause for a movie in my whole life. Did you like it, Mom? You want me tell you the truth, you do. I thought the beginning was a little slow but the rest was fun. The beginning was meant to be slow. I said I loved it. I'm trying to be honest. I think it was a wonderful picture. Alex. Bernie, Bernie Leavitt. - Sorry, I.. - Woodrow Wilson High? Bernie! Bernie Leavitt. Hi.. So you've got the mustache. Yeah, yeah. How are you? I'm great. I'm married now, have a couple of kids. - I'm a lawyer. - You look wonderful. - You look terrific. - 'I remember you.' Your father had the fruit store, Harry's Fruit Store. - That's right. - Now, this is my mother. - Hi. - Bernie Leavitt. - You must be proud of your son. - How's your father? - He passed away few years ago. - Oh, everyone's dying. - Uh, this is my wife, Beth. - Hi. I've followed his career from the beginning I used to watch TV for his credits. I get a big charge out of seeing his name. - 'Remarkable' - 'Really good.' 'You look beautiful.' The limousine's ready whenever you are. - 'Thank you very much.' - Oh, I see you're busy. - So I guess I won't hold you. - 'Bernie..' - I'll see you again. - Really nice to see you. Great. 'You get back to New York, look me up, I'm in the book.' Go back to the old neighborhood yet? It's a regular slum. I know, I still live there. Bye, Bernie. The thing that I'm saying is... is it more neurotic? Is it sick to worry about the outcome of something before you even...I mean, you saw the preview, you know the you know the film's gonna make a lot of money. It can't miss. Even if it doesn't make a fortune, I have a big future. There's no two ways. There'll be work. So...we live in a house, I mean, I love it, you love it but we both know it's small. So the question is.. ...why not move into a bigger place now? - Why not have two toilets? - We have two toilets. Three toilets, three toilets I mean, like, three toilets is the bottom line. Why not have a pool? Why not have a place where the kids can have some fun? I mean, like, before they're 50 years old. Or on the other hand do you say, that is the trap that everybody falls into. You get that kind of house. Get that kinda thing you build up.. Then you have to think very carefully about what you do. Because you need a fortune to pay for it. You take some kind of garbage project you don't believe in because you need the bread. Why worry about something.. ...why not just do it? I mean, just do it. Know what I mean? We'll get a big place with a lot of rolling countryside and a windmill, a barn. There will be some pigs, swine. Uh, at least one cow, a duck, and a pond. A little pond and in the middle of the pond with the sunlight...just on his back, there'll be a giraffe. but the thing that really, that concerns me more than anything about it is that there will be more for you to handle. I mean, there will be more work. You'll need to have help. There is that side of it, too. How do you feel about that? I think I can handle it. I think you're sensational. Look at the smog. Forget the house, we need an oxygen tent. I've got 13,000 in the bank.. ...7000 in the market. That's 20,000 liquid. 12,000 in the house, that's 32. 4000 in the land in Hawaii that's 36. 50,000 each for the kids, that's 136. 100,000 for the wife. That's 236, but not all liquid. The family would not go for much on the open market! 'And that is true' You have to be able to liquidate. - 'Are you almost finished?' - Come in with me. - 'No, It's too cold.' - Come in with me, woman. I'm making a butter.. Hotter. The baby is running around and I have to be at the clinic in 15 minutes. It will only take me 60 seconds. I'm done. Goodnight. Are we happy? Sure. Why am I still sad? - Ask your analyst. - Why don't you ask yours? I feel good. If you had to live on a desert island forever.. ...and you only had three foods, what would you pick? Cheeseburgers, chocolate chip ice-cream and.. - Does water count? - No, water's free. Eggs. I'll take cheeseburger.. ...with everything on it. Chocolate chip ice-cream. What else? - Eggs, caviar, and.. - You said only three. You want a movie? Read the bible. Every page is a movie. Solomon, that was the cat who had 750 wives and 350 concubines, virgins without number. The smartest man in the world. The richest man in the world. Women, he had the most women in the world. They say he drank gold dust so he could come 250 times a night. It's your dream. It's not my dream It's not my dream. 'My dream is to find a woman, a wife, a mother for my children.' You're a lucky man. You got a good woman. You could have a good woman if you looked at chicks that were a little older than 16. - 16 is biblical. - How old is Cherie? - I dunno, she says she's 19. - Alright. - I think she's 16. - Is she a good lay? - Terrible. - Why terrible? She says it hurts. - Says it hurts. - Who was the best? Who do you think? You can't judge 'em all the same. 'Like some chicks are great before, some during.' Some have beauty, grace. And even though they're not perfect, you like 'em. Who's the best? On the scale of ten. Ten is the best, right? Virginia was a ten. Is, is. There was a Greek chick once I had, uh, she was a ten. No, she was a nine and a half. - What's Cherie? - Two. - I don't care. - Beth's about an eight. - Eight is great for a wife. - Maybe a ten, I don't know. Hi, my name is Andre. This is my friend, Alex. - He's a movie director. - I'm Sophie, hi. Hi, Sophie. We were just discussing uh, uh, sex, you know grading chicks, like ten is the best, one is the worst. - Hmm. Did you ever have a ten? - Sure. - Did you? - I did about half an hour ago. That's great. You're beautiful. How terrific. You're so healthy. Yeah, it was really nice. - This is Gene. - Hi, Gene. - Hi. - My name's Andre. He's Alex. He's a movie director, Alex, Gene. - Groovy. - Is he ten, Sophie? We understand from Sophie that you and she just made love. - Oh, yeah, she's beautiful. - I was 19, I was about 70. Well, there's still time. Right? Yeah, there's still time. There's always time. There's always time, there's still time. There's time for this, time for that. Time for eating, time for fast.

Hi, Elma, how are you doing? Peter. You've met Burt. Burt Lancaster, Peter Fonda, Henry's son. I've made a film called Easy Rider. Cost about $200,000.. I was just introducing Peter Fonda and Burt Lancaster. Hiya. My name is Alex Morrison. Hi, Mr. Morrison. - Am I too early? - 'Oh, no, he's expecting you.' Mr. Morrison is here. Alright. He says you can go right in. I loved your picture. I love you. Alex, I'm Hal Stern. How are you, man? - How are you? - Pleasure to meet you. Really is. Come on, you hungry? - Uh, no.. - Oh, I ordered so much. Listen, man, I saw a preview of your picture.. ...and I think it's fantastic. I mean more than fantastic. I think it's one of the heaviest things I've seen. I'd like to be in business with you, it's that simple. - Oh, that's nice to hear. - I'm not being nice, Alex. I need you. What do you wanna do? Oh, le-let's sit down. - Want a cigarette? - No, I don't smoke. - I stopped. - Oh. Sit down. Wish I could quit myself. I'm into one of these, uh, where's that thing? One of these things. - Nice. - They don't work. Listen. I have...a lot of money. A lot. And I would like to share that money with some very heavy cats who I can get involved with and I'd like to make a ton more for myself. I'm upfront about money, I'm a pimp. I'm not kidding. I got a lot of scripts, a lot of books and I'd just like to get you going. Well, the money thing is very nice and I'd like to... 'Cause I like to have fun. Really do. It's very difficult to have fun in this town. Especially if you got schmucks working for you. 'Cause you end up doing work yourself and there's no.. I don't wanna do that. Okay. Is that, uh, that Chagall...is it real? Yeah. It's a lithograph. - Yeah. - You like Chagall? - Yes, I do. Do you mind? - No. Fantastic piece. Look at that stuff in there, man. I would say the ceiling at the Paris Opera House is about the heaviest piece I've ever seen. - I've never been to Paris... - You'd like to go? Well, yes.. Would you like to go to Paris to read a book? I'm serious. I've a book you must read, and I want you to enjoy it while you're reading it. Why should you read a book in LA? Here, take your wife. - Careful, careful. - Sorry. - 'Uh..' - 'I'm very serious about this.' There's no commitment here of any kind. No involvement. This is just a project. I want you to read it and enjoy yourself while reading it. You have a family? Yes, I have two daughters, twelve and six. You don't wanna take the kids? I'll get you a housekeeper. - I'm being straight with you. - Yes, I, um, work, uh.. Let me, let me pitch you a story. An idea. You wanna do the same kind of picture you just did or is your head open? No, my head's open to, uh, to anything.. Just that the end result, I can be personally involved. Well, can you get personally involved with a project that will make, uh, 50 million dollars? You mean that's the end result, I see. Uh, yes, if-if the picture is my picture. I dig, I dig. It can be done though? Yes, I think so. You're a nice cat. Now, come on, let's eat. - You like Caesar salad? - Yes, I love Caesar salad. - You like Mark Twain? - I love Mark Twain. How about Huckleberry Finn? Huckleberry Finn, it's a great novel. Seen a couple of movies on it, if that's what you mean, huh? Excellent. Terrific, Eli. I see Huckleberry Finn as a 17-year old kid. 16, 17, 18. A revolutionary. The kid has got his head right where it's at. 'Revolutionary in a black man, that hasn't changed.' I see it with music. Bert Brecht, Kurt Vile, that kind of feeling. Contemporary, social comment, America is the shore. Coming down the raft as a black man, what's on the shore? - 'What is America?' - Absolute... Racism, fascism, police brutality, that's the shore. - Yeah. Yeah. - Crap. But coming down the raft, black man, revolutionary dreaming. - Excuse me, may I? - Yes. - The smoke.. - I'm sorry. It's, uh...well, as an idea terrific. 'Uh, it will take a long time.' - Thank you, Eli. - Yes, sir. I'm not in a, in a position.. I wanna do something now. 'I can't deal with a musical...' Alright, enough said, we have to find something you wanna do. I don't wanna push you into corners, man. - Garlic bread? - Thanks. What about love story? If it's good. Excuse me a second. I've a book. It's called The Show. - I haven't read it. - It's Sinhalese. It's about a 20-year-old girl who gets a heart transplant. That's okay, man. Transplants make people nervous. - No... - 'They do, they do, man.' Transplants are common around the world or the United States - Alright, tell me about it. - Well...take it seriously. Up until the transplant, chick is perfectly normal. She's bright, she functions, she gets laid. She has friends, she has relationships. After the transplant, she doesn't have normal functions anymore. She.. - Oh, come on, man, it's... - It just seems... - So it's handled? - It seems.. It just seems terribly obvious to me, that's all. 'All love stories are obvious.' Romeo and Juliet's obvious. Promise you'll read it. Read it in Paris. No, I think, maybe I.. Ah...what do you wanna do? What project do you wanna do? What, what is the... I wanna do a, a film about the.. ...well, I think the black situation in this country.. I mean, there-there has been three hundred years of benevolence and fraternalism and racism in this country. I agree. Michelle could be black. Serious. There's a perfectly white doctor. Keep it more interesting. You've got to read to see what I mean. Okay. Black people get transplants too, you know. I tell you, in no way am I interested in a film about a girl who has a heart transplant. No way. I'm just, that in my head, I'm not into that. Okay? - Yeah. - Terrific... - What about a western? - A western? Excuse me, I got a script. Ah.. It's a western. I got about $300,000 in this thing. It's not very good. It's a piece of shit but the cat writing it knew nothing. But Indians... Today, right now, reservation life, for real. I know exactly what.. I mean, that could be sensational.g? That could be really po... - Could be great? - 'Simple.' And direct. - 'Heavy.' - Good. 'Heavy secret' - Indians, today. - Could be. Okay. That I'll read. Any of the big guys will be perfect. - Lancaster, Kirk Douglas. - Tony Quinn. Oh, Quinn would be fantastic. Really would. Quinn would be like, you know, a dream. 'Oh, Christ, Quinn would be fantastic.' Ever see a French film called L'Idiot by Gerard Philipe? - Yes. - I own American rights to it. Listen, I tell you, why I have a, I do have a problem. You know, I got to.. I have to pick up my daughter at school. Her teeth need to be.. It's two months. Okay, man. Hey, whatever. Will you think about these things? The wine is terrific. I'll get you some. And want you thinking. Seriously, I want you thinking. I want you to put this...on your living room wall. Oh no, don't be silly man. I mean that's a real Chagall. - Alright, okay, okay. - Well.. - Bye. - I'll see ya. - So long. - Okay. - Alright. - I'm gonna keep on asking you. - Okay. - Rosemary? 'Yes.' Here. Put against the.. Remind me to call him about The Navajo Man. Okay. I don't think I can do this alone. Yeah, let me help you. I've never been in Rome before. My wife would love it here. Well, call her. Tell her to come. Ah-h, I tried to call this morning but telephone company's on strike. Well, there is a strike everyday in Rome. They don't last long. What would you like? What are you gonna have? Do you like this trip? Are those girls hookers? 'I would say so.' What do you call them in Italian? - Battona. - Battona? - Battona. - Do Battona ever go on strike? They work more when there is a strike? It's a great place to come and have a meeting. Excuse me. Madam, scuzi. - You are Federico Fellini? - Yes, but I'm working now. I'm uh.. Excuse me. Mario. But you cannot come in like this. It's very rude of me, I know but...uh, I'm a director from California and.. ...you have to meet the greatest director in the world. From Variety Lights, to I Vitelloni La strada, La Dolce Vita, 8-1/2, Satyricon. You left out The White Sheik, Il bidone, Nights of Cabiria. Oh, yes. Juliet of the Spirits, Nights of Cabiria. Thank you very much. I-I'm beg your pardon, I-I'm working. I see. I see you're working now. - I'm a director myself. - Are you looking for somebody? No, here, uh, yes. I've come to see Mr. Lombarde but.. He is not here, he is in, at the production office. This is a casting room. I've directed only one film which you probably haven't seen yet because it.. The film that I've done, you haven't seen, I don't think.. because it isn't out yet. - No. I've not seen. - No, it's not out yet. Ah, okay, I see that you're working so I will leave you to that discussion. Wanted to say hello. I-I should show you the way where you can.. Thank you. My name is Alex Morrison. - Very compelling. Goodbye. - Yes I know. Goodbye. - Are you an actor? - No, I'm a director. - Yeah, you told me. - Director. And I think the office over there.. What's that you're working on? That is a little film for TV about clowns. - Clowns? - I'm tracking now. That's terrific. I think the office could be that.. The second door. Yes, alright.. - Ciao. - Thank you very much. It's just.. May I ask you one question, please? If you were alone on a desert island with only three kinds of food.. ...three kinds of food that you could eat what three foods would you pick? Why you make to me this question? Because it...is important to me. - You need to know it. - I need to. Because.. ...in this moment, I'm making a diet. So to think to food is disturbing. - Since... - Goodbye. Good luck to you And good luck to your work. Excuse me, if I appear so rude, you know, but I'm working. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Mario. Did you think about that Lenny Bruce project? Yeah. What'd you think? Well, I think that, you know you could know a lot about the nightclub field and.. It could be very interesting. I think you should do it. Yeah, who's gonna play Lenny Bruce? The only person who can play Lenny Bruce is Lenny Bruce and he's no longer available. Can you look at that house with me this afternoon? What time? Uh, 4 o'clock. 4 o'clock I gotta meeting with my agent, but I can cancel it. - No, it's okay. - How much is it? They can't go by the asking price. How much? - 200,000. - Oh, that's insanity. I know. But the agents had all these houses start at ridiculous figures and then come down to, like, a 125,000. You just can't go by the asking price. Tell him I'm not gonna look at a house starting at $200,000. You need to tell him that I told him so. - Okay, you tell him. - What's that supposed to mean? It means if you want a house, you have to help me find it. You know your analyst's getting to be a pain in the ass. I'm sorry. Yeah. What are you buyin'? Oh, come on. The kids teeth are falling out from that crap. Hey, do we wait in the car? I'm sorry. Buy the cookies, I'll probably eat 'em anyway. You keep saying you're sorry and then you keep jumping on me. What are you looking at, lady? So I just.. Look. Go and look at the house, I mean.. I want you to. I really do. We can afford it. Because it's just that I want.. ...you to make the decisions from here. I can't tell you what to do. '2.78, please.' 'No. No. You can't take him away.' - 'Petty.' - 'Oh, don't, honey. He's mine.' 'Petty.' Goodbye ,little Dodgy. 'You won't let him forget me, will you?' 'No, he'll remember you. Look, he's laughing.' 'Yeah.' 'Come Harry, time's up.' 'Goodbye, little fella.' 'Now, look, you keep mama.' 'If dad shows up, he never wanted no kids.' 'No, he'll never show up, the big blowhard' 'You have to leave now.' My braces hurt. Well, baby, you gotta wear 'em. What are you reading? Cortez on the Aztec Conquest. It's about Cortez and Montezuma. Is there a movie in it? Yeah. - Yeah. There's a movie in it. - Then why don't you do it? I'll do it sometime though. You know what's it about? 'Yeah, we learnt it in school. Cortez conquered Montezuma' 'with only a few hundred men and some horses.' That's right, yeah. Yeah, but it.. He conquered him, I mean Montezuma had thousands of men and he conquered him really.. Because Montezuma thought Cortez was a God. You see, in their religion, in the Aztec religion.. ...it was predicted that in the year 1518 a half man, half beast would come to Mexico and he would be the God. Like a.. - Quetzalcoatl. - 'Quetzalcoatl.' 'Yeah, you know. Yeah, Quetzalcoatl.' 'And that he would come in the year 1518.' Cortez came in 1518. An-and in many ways, Cortez himself felt...God-like. He felt like a God-like warrior. He fulfilled.. Because his mission was to bring Christianity. He felt, in a way and partly because of the way people treated him, he felt that he was.. ...more than a representative of God. He was a part of God, and then after a while when he became so lucky, he felt that he.. ...he was in a way a God. You know. And in a way, it's an extraordinary story. Do you ever wonder if you're real? You mean if am me. If, uh, if what me is.. ...is really what I am? No, sometimes I get up in the mornin and I look at my fingers, and I wonder who I am.. ...you know and why.. It's like a miracle to be on this earth. Do you think about dying? Sometimes, but, you know.. What do you think? What's gonna happen and everything, you know. It might be better than-than living. Nobody knows. Do you think that you ever were something else? Sometimes. We're all alike. Each of us is a.. We are like, each of us, each of us is like a God. We are? Eat your banana. You don't know how I've been thinking about you. I ain't slept nights from thinking. Yeah? I don't sleep so good, neither. I didn't know till a couple of weeks ago about you taking the rap for me? - What movie is that? - Riffraff. Yeah, no kiddin'? Honey, I guess I sorta blew my top the last time I saw you but.. It's Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow. Doesn't look like Spencer Tracy. Yeah. But it is. This was when he was a lot younger. What does it mean to you...when you see that? What-What do you feel when you see that, when you see.. ...two people, a man and woman, come together and kiss. It means they must like each other. 'They like each other, or they are attracted to each other.' 'Or they feel something, a kind of energy in themselves.' 'For each other.' 'When, when the boy you like at school' 'when you see him, wha-what do you feel? - Nothing. I don't know. - Oh, you too. - What do you feel? - I don't know. Well, but, do you feel warm or.. I feel happy. - And your eyes feel good? - Yeah. Do you know what it feels like in your eyes? I don't know. It's important that you understand that. It is important that you feel.. ...free about that, that loving is really a sensationally marvelous wonderful thing. And that it.. There is no way ever... 'Amy, come and eat, honey.' Oh, cool. 'Go on, go wash your hands.' 'I'd rather stay here the rest of my life and rot.' 'Mrs. Marvin.' 'Make him get out of here and don't ever let him come back.' Thank you. This is my husband, Mr. Morrison. - This is Mr. Wayne, the broker. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Right on time. I hear your new picture is wonderful. Well, thank you very much. I used to be in show-business myself. - I was a press extra. - That's terrific. What are you planning to do next? I'm not sure. How much down do they want? It's a question of how much you actually pay for the house. Oh, it's a nice patio, isn't it? I won't pay a 160. You don't have to pay 160, Mr. Morrison. What a relief. They're getting a divorce, they have to sell. I know another couple that might be getting a divorce. - I love these windows. - Casement windows. You can hardly find them anymore. I bet it has a Saint Charles gate. - Yes. - I'm Mr. Wayne, the broker. Oh, yes. Come right in. Like a great motel. Well, look at the house not the furniture. Let's save this for last. Just see the parlor room. Parlor room was just redone. Oh, I could use this for a den, terrific. This is a strong house. Spanish is hard to find today. - Can we see the kitchen? - Right this way. - I don't like it. - Might as well see the rest. And these are the original hand-painted beams. The butler's pantry. - An old-fashioned sink. - Isn't it pretty? It's very nice. It's.. I mean it is nice. Look at that. Oh, this is the breakfast room. Nice yard. Wait till you see the kitchen. The dishwasher was put in two years ago. The garbage disposal is two years old, too. - We'll take it. - You wanna wait in the car? I'm just kidding. Let's see the pool. I love it. Can we see the upstairs? Sure. - Bye. - Bye Thank you. I'll call you tomorrow, dear. Thanks, bye. I think it could be very nice. We'd have to redo the whole place. No, not really. Mostly, it's getting rid of junk... For a $160,000, I don't wanna a house you have to redo. Well, we could make a very low offer. I offer 35,000. - Oh, let's not mope, huh? - Oh, come on. No, I mean, I just.. I don't know what you want. I want us to be happy. No, I mean you change your mind every day. JesusChrist! What do you expect? - 'I beg your pardon.' - For what? For staring. You are Jeanne Moreau, aren't you? Yes. 'I never walk up to actresses. I, uh...I never do.' 'I'm-I'm sorry if I'm being rude, but I, uh' I can't help myself. I, I love your work. 'I think you're fantastic talent.' 'Jules et Jim, LaNotte, The Bride Wore Black' Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant work. Thank you. I'm a director myself. I, uh, I've only made one film. Maybe you've seen.. No, you haven't. Couldn't see it, couldn't have seen it, it isn't out yet. Oh, this is incredible. I had a project for you.. You must have a million projects. - Au Revoir. - Au Revoir. If you were alone on a desert island and there were only three foods that you could have what three foods would you take? You're masochist. In my film, you answered the question. Let me see. Chinese peas, and fish. I love fish. There would be plenty on an island. And cherries. Typically French. Au revoir. "As I sat down, under his-under his shadow with great delight" "and his fruit was sweet to my taste." "It brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love." Ah, that's what I like. 'They say true love is intoxicating.' "I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up" "nor awake my beloved till he please." What a lie! Till he please, that's the one thing I, I don't understand. You wanna taste? You want a little banana cake? - The, uh.. - Try it again. Goes like this. "I am the rose of.." Tyrone, watch out "I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys. 'That's a beautiful text.'s.. Very beautiful.'Wait. 'It could be.' - 'Could be very psychedelic.' - 'Yeah.' 'Right? Rose and Sharon could be psychedelic band.' 'Yes, definitely.' And it goes on, and-and he says "As a lily among, as the lily.. Nobody's listening to me. Nobody's listening. "As the lily isn't among the thorns so is my love among the daughters" "And as the apple tree is among trees of the woods" so is my love among the sons." Right, and she says I sat down... Yeah, really, really is a beautiful text. Oh, it's the most beautiful thing ever written on love and god and religion. Whatever it is, it's mystical. And she... The words are completely lost, you know, in new translation. Right, but here, and then she says "I sat down under his shadow." "His shadow," God's shadow, "with great delight." "And his banner," you know. "And his banner over me was love." What's happening, man? Met a producer yesterday who offered me a western based on the life of Donald Quixote. - Sounds interesting. - You should read the script. 'I thought it was good.' I gotta justify my career moves to my kids, it was crappy. 'You don't like anything.' But I got a good idea. Go ahead? Anybody wanna hear my idea for a new film? What? Wanna hear my new movie? - Only if it's good. - It's terrific. - 'It'll be good.' - How do you know? - Are you a prophet? - Yes. Do you want to hear my new movie? It's a film about a black revolutionary leader. Black is beautiful. Ah, how would you know? A black revolutionary leader a cat named, like, Timmy Tomson, say. A cat from LA, a cat with charisma, a cat with power. A combination of Eldridge Cleaver and Patrice Lumumba and Malcolm X and... - Extraordinary man. - An incredible man. - Not sure about that? - What does this mean? Come on, wait-wait, let me get the story before the fight begins, okay? Remember how we had that conversation about what would happen if the Blacks took over LA? If they didn't riot in Watser in the ghetto. If they rioted in Beverly hills.. - This could happen. - Sure, okay. Well, my man, Jimmy Tomson, he mobilizes the Black community and he attacks LA. He attacks white LA. - He takes off... - Does he succeed? - Yeah, man, he succeeds. - It'll always fail. - Come on, let him finish. - No, chance, no. No, they can succeed, absolutely. They can succeed...and he does. He takes over Beverly Hills. I'd like to see where you'll be if it happens. Oh, come on, cool it, cool it. You guys are going on forever? They get killed, wiped out, the Birches are waiting for them. The Birches, the police system is waiting for them. - You know, you're a fascist. - I'm a Jew. - You're a Jewish fascist. - And you're a phony liberal. Terrific, eh? It really blows your mind. Alright, wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Stop yelling in my ear please. - Alright, cool it. What's the point of the movie? - The point is... - 'I don't like it.' Thanks, Andre, fall of the wall. The point is that whitey will not give any power or freedom to the black man.. ...if the conversation is polite. And after resistance, revolution is inevitable. If the resistance does not work, and we know that resistance ain't doing much here in this country right now. - Right on, baby, right on. - Absolutely. - Powerful idea. - It's science fiction. No man, believe me, it can work. You get-get the whole youth movement, get the STS in it. You get them.. You get, ah.. You get the Chicano brother. - You get the Indian brothers. - You get the Gay brothers. You got 'em all involved. I'm telling you it's a powerful idea. I-I don't think blacks could do anything like that. - What'd you think, Lewis? - I don't know. Don't ask him, he's white. Leo, you know, I think are a bigot. I think you don't know what you're talking about. You're an asshole, man. Come on, blacks don't have staying power. You're an asshole. Alright, alright. Wait a minute. Come on, man. - Don't you yell at me. - Alright, hold on, hold on. Will you please let me talk to this guy and stop interrupting me while I'm talking to him. The argument's between me and him. Hah? I'd appreciate it. Prick. Thank you. I'm so disappointed in you, I cannot tell you. You are a bigot, you confirmed my worst feelings about you. 'I'm sorry, nothing I can do about it.' Alex. He is a bigot, but the movie stinks. 'You know why the movie stinks?' 'Because of what's happening right here and now.' When was the last time you masturbated? I'm serious. I know women. Come on, Norman. What do you mean, the last time that I actually masturbated? How long you've been married? Seven years in November. When was the last time, last week? Nothing to be ashamed of. Hey, I'm not ashamed - When? - What, for real? Why? His movie's about masturbation and the black problem. Fuck him, but you gonna get yours. Come on now, when?. Last week? - Two days ago. - Terrific. Married seven years, did it two days ago, it's very healthy. - To do it? - No, to talk about it. To do it is very sick. How about you, Lewis? - How long you've been married? - Five years. - You're married that long. - It'll be five. When was the last time? I know black guys are like white guys. - Sure, I do it. - When? Last week in the shower. Who did you visual, who did you visualize when you did it? - I don't remember. - Oh, come on, Lewis. 'Who did you visualize?' Well, there's this chick in my office. That's terrific. 'Married seven years, did it two days ago.' 'Married five years, did it a week ago.' 'Beautiful.' Bible says a man mustn't waste his seed. When was your last? I'm doing it right now while we're talking about it. What, what did you say? 'Oh, I couldn't do it for whole year.' 'I did it for my girlfriend of mine in New York' 'and she committed suicide.' 'Oh, great. Maybe it was the kid's work.' Anybody else got any tarot with suicides, tarot with suicides? Sometime I do it for myself. It's really the most frightening. Lewis did it to himself in the shower last week. But you got to believe in yourself. This is your environment card. - Seven of ones. - 'Oh, that's what I got.' That's what you got? Could be you and me, baby. You've had a certain amount of success brought to you. And you're in a very good state. This is your reaction to it. "Aw, the ace of swords." The ace of swords is one of the strongest Aces. Oh, everybody knows that. 'Tremendous ace.' 'No, it's a tremendous combination of strength.' 'What's coming from you is even stronger then the environment.' You're integrating the environment. The idea for my film. I mean that's what my.. Will that work? I don't know what the future is? Okay, this is it. Your highest hopes and motivations. This is what you really, really want. Wait a minute, I think we should clear the beach for this one. Dig it. It's a death card! Look.. - The sun rising.. - O-o-oh! Why you doing this if it's such a joke. Because it's fun. 'If the cards are good, it may be my new religion.' 'Oh, in your subconscious." 'Oh, it's very exciting.' 'The card know the armor, it's not death' 'it's a not physical..' ♪ You got time on your side ♪ And I know ♪ Oh oh oh, I know.. Mama, I want you. It's not that.

I have to tinkle. We'll stop at a gas station soon as we cross the border. What's a border. The border is what you have to cross so that you can tinkle. Dad. 'The border is where Mexico is Mexico' 'becomes the United States.' 'What's the United States?' 'That's where we live. California's is in there.' What makes you say that? California is a state in the United States. No, why do you say that? I studied about it in the fourth grade. How do you know it? How do you really know it? How long were you in Mexico? Three days. 'Where?' Encinada one night, Rosarito beach for two nights. - What was the purpose? - To find some meaning in life. I'm just kidding, you know, on a holiday, you know. - Any fresh fruit? - No. We don't have any fresh fruit, do we, honey? - You know we don't have any. - Oh, this guy's makin me..

'You gotta have a bathroom. what do you guys use, huh?' 'Would you be careful with those cups please, they're brittle.' 'Okay, you can go. Thank you.' 'Thank you.' Thank you. Thank you very much for the wonderful rest stop. Maybe, I should make a film about.. ...smuggling grass across the border. Only, the grass turns out to be oregano. When they get killed, they die for 10 pounds of oregano. I could call it, "They Died for 10 Pounds of Oregano." I talk a lot of movie crap, don't I? Yeah. I'm sorry. It's okay. I got to stop it. Did you see that? What? I waved at those soldiers, and they waved back at me. Marines. They gave me the peace sign. Wow, those guys are prisoners they probably don't wanna go to war.

I don't think I could've made it, anyway. When was the last time we made it twice? Umm...before we were married. No, I remember, it was when we were in San Francisco. We went on the weekend without the kids. We made it twice then, I remember. I don't remember. Oh, yeah, we were at the Mark Hopkins. It was a warm night. Yeah, the window was open. The wind was blowing the curtain. We made it. And then, right away, we made it again. I remember it like it was yesterday. Guess so. Hell, you were probably sleeping. I remember it. Oh, yeah, Sid called. And said, I gotta get the will changed because my estate's gonna be larger. Okay. And he said, since we're getting it changed 'do we still want your sister to take care of the children?' 'If anything happened to both of us.' My sister loves the kids, and I think that's the main thing. I don't know, I worry about your sister, I mean, she's square. She'll give the kids a good home, that's all I care about. I care the kids know something about the world and grow up to be individuals. We were through this all once before. And my sister was the only one that we both agreed on. Let me up. Ah, I don't know. If you don't want my sister, I'm open to someone else. Look, sweetheart, look. When I.. You gotta look at it like we're both dead. Like we're not here anymore. Like we're wiped out. Like, we've had a car accident. In an airplane, we've drowned. We are dead. The children are totally alone. They have no-one. No-one to guide them. Now, do you still want your sister to have them? Of everyone that we know now, yes. Your sister's kids live in front of a television set. They don't even have a book. - Our kids watch it too. - Yeah, but we got books. - 'Good morning.' - Good morning, honey. Don't kiss me, think I'm getting a cold. - I pray I'm not getting a cold. - Why don't you take an aspirin? No, I'm gonna see a doctor. What good is a doctor gonna do? She wakes me up, every single morning. Good morning, well, it will be different when we move. You've been saying that for two years. Don't kiss me, Amy. I think I'm getting a cold. I wasn't gonna kiss you. A-a-ah. What's come over you..? I read that treatment last night. What treatment? The treatment about the man who wants to.. ...exterminate all the rats in New York. I don't wanna see a movie about rats. It wasn't about rats. It was about a man. A man with a social conscience. An exterminator, a man who-who suddenly sees that society is full of rats. - Is it good? - Yeah, it's very interesting. What do you want for breakfast? Aw, come on, for Christ's sake I'm trying to tell you about a movie I might do. Can't you tell us at breakfast? I'm very interested. Do you want eggs or cereal? Alright, fine. Can't even make a decision about what you want to eat. Leave me for Christ's sake, I'll hit you. Well, dad, we're only trying to help. You tell all these ideas for movies and they sound good. But when we say anything bad, you get angry. - Yeah, I'm sorry, baby. - Makes us nervous. - 'Nancy, don't eat in bed.' - Give me some. Alright, that's enough. I wanna do a movie about.. ...I wanna do something important. I wanna do a movie about life, about.. Do a movie about us. That's 8 1/2. You've absolutely no interest in anything that I am trying to do. You just, take absolutely... Oh, baby, I'm sorry.. I'm sorry, really I am sweetheart, look. I've got a cold working. I'm very tired, I'm very nervous and I'm sorry, I really... Will you get the ho-ho's out of the bed? Come on, sweetie. - I'm sorry, Amy. - We understand. - What's 8 1/2? - A-ah! What's 8 1/2? 8 1/2? 8 1/2, is a movie...by Fellini. It's about himself. About a movie director. A lot of flashbacks, about his mother and father. His childhood. Doesn't sound like such a great movie. No, it's the way he did it. 'Why don't you do a picture for kids?' Mo-mom. Mom, what are you doing here? Mr. Fellini calls. I shouldn't come? - I didn't know he called. - Sure he calls. You're the one, who never calls. Oh, mom, please. I'm not a kid anymore. I'm a big director. How are you, my dear, sweet son? Mom, I'm confused about what to do next. Life was easier for you when you weren't a big time director. Mom, please. Not here. Don't argue with Fellini. What's the matter honey? Vicky, you're the best. In the whole...whole universe. You know that. So you gonna get laid? From your ex-wife. She liked it. 'Here, drink some wine.' - No, I'm hungry. - 'Drink a little wine...' Not thirsty, I'm hungry. Hungry, hungry always gotta be contentions. 'Always arguing. Little wine won't hurt.' You're right. Absolutely. Shukla. Here. Why you always playing games? I thought love you. An old friend, I've a.. 'As a Hindu.' 'I think they are not allowed to drink alcohol.' And they say.. ...I think it's in the Quran, I don't know. I will not drink, one drop of wine. And they have a friend who is totally religious and he goes.. That was the drop. Well, who goes like this? After he goes like that. Your ex-wife. I was with Adel the other day. She told me you're acting. And she had some crumbs on her fingers. I went to her, she didn't let me to do. So I said you're inhibited. Where is my pussycat? Pussy? Morrison. Ah. Hi. How was it? I love you. Was...great. Was great, I'm exhausted, but it was great, it was was beautiful. Oh, I'm so glad. It was beautiful, there was only one bad time. I thought maybe I wasn't gonna come back. I was looking in the mirror at myself and I could see right through to my bone. I looked like a wolf, I didn't know who I was looking at. When I realized it was me, I got scared. - Are you hungry? - No, tired. Exhausted. I want to you to sleep with me. Thank you. - How is Andre? - He's my movie. He's my movie. You just listen to this. 'Feel anything, yet?' - 'I'll let you know.' - 'Should've felt something.' - 'What do you feel?' - 'I'm very..' 'Well, you've taken about 10,000 trips so.' 'Maybe it works faster on you.' 'Oh, no, no, this is great acid.' 'You should be feeling something by now.' 'I feel like, I'd like you stop bugging me.' - 'He's a professional guru.' - He is a professional druggist. - 'Your heart beating faster?' - 'A little.' - 'You have any palpitations.' - 'I don't know just faster.' 'You don't have a heart trouble, do you?' 'You can't take acid if you've heart trouble' 'Terrific. This is the great time to tell me.' Wait till the part, where we get it done with. Why don't you play it for me later? 'You know where he gets into himself.' It-its a movie. It's a, this is like to the picture. 'I went to a night club, they wanted a singer. I got a job.' - 'Called, "The Cave."' - 'Lot of chicks?' 'Everyday, that's all I did. 'I sang and I screwed.' Want a sandwich? - 'Were you happy?' - 'I was happy. 'Happier than now?' Wh-when he gets into the-the part about the...about the yoga and the health food the beginning of the mystical trip and back in fourth between the-the show business slickster and the mystic. Show business slickster mystic. And then he gets into the acid. And the more acid he takes, the worse his career becomes. He starts, he starts losing his career. Then, he marries Virginia. They get on the whole Virginia trip. Then he goes in the Buddhism. He starts losing totally the whole show business thing. - Starts putting on weight. - Yeah, I know... When you hear it, all together it's a man's life. It's a story of a man's life. Why isn't that a movie? That's enough, the man is enough, right? But the real point, the point about the whole thing. The thing that really is beautiful to me. He's back to being a Jew again. The whole Bible thing. Even though he kids, he believes it. He really does. - He's back to where he began. - Maybe he's still not happy. He's-he's-he's happy and sad he's.. ...like everybody. - Now, why isn't that a movie? - Well, maybe, it is. I have nothing. Oh, you're tired now. It's too bad. Honey, come on, drink your coffee and... You should've been with me. You really should've. You should've been with me, I wanted you to be with me. I'm sorry. No, Sorry what is the good of this sorry shit. - I don't wanna take it. - But I needed you. You told me that you were taking acid, so you could get a movie. You wouldn't have taken it in anyway. You can't make me do things. I have to wanna do them. Bloody hell nothing. 'I needed you. I needed you with me.' Come on, talk to me. I'm sorry, baby. I'm here for you, when you want me to be here. I'm.. You don't let me breath. You-you just choke me. You just want me to say things that gonna make you happy. And I want you to be happy, It's not that I wanna share.. I can't pretend it. I don't know what you want. I really.. ...I don't know what you want from me. - What's the matter? - Nothing, sweetheart. - We're just crying. - What happened? Nothing happened, baby. Mommy did...leave mommy alone. - Were you arguing? - No, we weren't. Mommy was just.. ...mommy was telling the truth and.. You should always tell the truth. Oh, sweetheart. You know, sometimes that's hard to give. Don't make it about yourself. It's okay, mom. Don't cry. - Here, let me check. - Dad. How about some toast? Sit. Come. You want some cereal or something? - Take. - No. You don't want it? Something.. Anybody want some cereal, baby. Want some cereal? We can only achieve our goals through non violence. But your non-violence has not worth, Mr. Gandhi. History has shown that nothing else can work. We cannot wait for history, our people are starving. 'Our people need food and closing in shelter.' 'Mr. Gandhi's right..' - You're gonna cry. - I don't know. Put on your sun glasses, if you do. 'No matter where it happens.' We the people of the Republic of South Africa. Will not accept Apartheid. But our system of Apartheid works. We believe it's the only way for the races to survive. 'Apartheid is evil, it's like caste system was in India.' All people regardless of race, color or creed should be treated equally. 'The problems of Republic of South Africa' 'and United States are completely different.' 'What do you think Mr. Martin Luther King?' I have a dream, I have a dream. Someday all people will live together in peace and harmony.
