Tiger is entering the ring! Look at that swagger. He's in the zone tonight. His opponent is Haji, the Romanian fighter known for flaunting the rules. This will be an epic battle of good versus evil! "Gao Finances, We Collect Every Debt!" The Gluttonous Boxer began boxing from a young age, eating and fighting his way from the countryside to the city! He's been 5-0 since changing his fighting style to MMA. Let's see if he'll eat Haji for dinner tonight! She looks familiar. Indeed she does. Tiger began his career as a boxer. His teacher, Ma Qing, was on the World Games Team. Ladies and gentlemen, you must all be at the edge of your seats. This highly anticipated bout is about to begin. On the blue side... At 75 kilograms and 178 centimeters, hailing from Romania... HA-JI! Coming up next, on the red corner... Also 75 kilograms and at 180 centimeters... China's very own "Gluttonous Boxer"... TI-GER! Bullshit MMA. It's all for show! Good night, Master! Good night, Master! Good night, Master! Hurry! Go, Tiger, go! Haji's got Tiger pinned down. He has the upper hand! That's a foul!

Foul...! Foul! That was totally a foul! Kick his ass! Get his blind spot! Haji's a dirty boxer, but the audience seems to love him for the entertainment value. Tiger's got a hell of a fight ahead of him. Get him! Come on! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! How can you bite him?! This is out of control! The ref has stopped the match! That was a damn foul! Oh God! He defied gravity! The Spinning Revolver! What an amazing move! Spinning Revolver! I remember now. That's Granny Snow's granddaughter! I got her, too. Cuckoo Du! She owes 400 grand! Quan!

Everyone else gets a bowl this small, but mine was always this big! How's your granny? You don't know? You haven't visited her? Do you even call her? What the hell?! That's messed up! Sure. People usually get three pieces of pig intestines! Your granny gave me six pieces! Hot girls washing cars is so popular! But your girl's expensive, man! Remember to pay up! She has to pay up, too! Is he a musician? Who? The scumbag! Is he talented? So talented that you abandoned your granny for him? Is he handsome? Is he more handsome than me? That's him! That's him? He's handsome like Qu Fengfeng? "Can you sing? Can you dance?" Hey, where are you going? "Hi, everyone, I'm Qu Fengfeng!" "Join me on this season of Perfect Diva!"

I'm quitting fighting soon. Dr. Li says if I don't quit soon, I'll go blind! My liver will rupture! And I'll get Parkinson's! So I've made a decision. I'm opening a hotpot restaurant! I'll copy the clear soup from LapuLapu, the spicy soup from Aroma Shu, the ingredients from Little Fish and the service style from HaiLiLao! Sabotage! Hey! These people pay up on time every month And you still smash up the place! Are you nuts?! Damn right I'm freakin' crazy! You won't fight, you won't collect my debts, and you won't even let me collect?

You're done with her debt! I'll take it from here. Fine, I'll fight him! But it's the last time! We'll see! Pack it up! We're done here! Hello, everyone, this is Perfect Diva. Welcome! Should I sing, or should I expose Qu? With that voice, you'll probably get eliminated. If you expose Qu, you'll get eliminated and beaten by his fans. But I can protect you. You decide. Welcome the contestant who had the highest score in auditions. She's got that cool knee slide. Pearl, the kick-ass rocker! They may be badly hurt I choose to let go I go against the grain What's happened to your legs? I hit the floor too hard. My left kneecap was smashed and the ligament on my right knee was torn. The doctor says I may never walk again. But it was totally worth it... in the name of music! On behalf of music... I thank you! Qu, the King of Originality! Originality, my ass! You're just a thief! Hey! I live life with no compromise I chase my dreams with no regrets Don't think that I've already given my all Don't look at the tears welling in my eyes You gotta give every-everything To get every-everything Give much more than more Love all of me No compromise With you, even tears are valuable Without you, my mind wanders There's uncertainty in a halfway love But there's nothing false about my sorrows Even haggardness can feel melancholic - Even haggardness can feel melancholic - Another damn thief! - Even haggardness can feel melancholic - What do I do? Cuckoo! You're up next! Singing's not gonna work. - Give him a piece of your mind! - Got it. Hey! Hey! Toss this at him! Toss it, then run back here. We'll fight our way out. Go on! Our next contestant won us over at the audition with an original composition that sounds like the songs of... Qu Fengfeng! Qu! Qu! Qu... He has enough fans to drown us in spit! Here is Cuckoo Du! I regret nothing and have someone share the fatigue of loneliness Is that someone out there? Shake! Dance! Why did the audience just go nuts? It turns out that... Qu just put on another cool pose! He's truly the people's idol! Don't be so stiff! Are you going to play something on that ukulele? She's not going to expose him? Do you still remember that place? It reminds us what all this was for The train of time stops for nothing Those who leave halfway will mature and find another answer I can only forget or forgive I can only smile with disappointment Without any despair I will continue on this road alone Did you write this song, too? Yes. It's still very close to Qu's style! It's Qu that is close to my style! The two contestants with the lowest scores will be evaluated and one of them will be eliminated tonight. Please welcome everyone back on the stage. The two contestants with the lowest scores are... Cuckoo and Han. Qu is skipping the evaluation He just voted to eliminate Cuckoo! That's right! Cuckoo had the weakest stage presence! That's right! At least Han shewed some variety in her dance moves! This move is Madonna's. Lady Gaga. Rihanna. Sex Pistols. And Phoenix Legend. You're the King of Originality, Aren't you supposed to hate copycats? That's right! At least Cuckoo's songs are original compositions. That's right! I'd rather Han just did a tacky dance with a fan! I was so nervous. Are you mad that I didn't tell Qu off? - Next time! - Right! But the next round is your last chance. The competition is too fierce. It's time for boot camp. Right! Zhao is so damn nice! Right! Her breasts are so damn big! I'm hungry! Then let's eat! - I want spicy hot pot! - Hot pot it is! It doesn't hurt... It doesn't hurt... Lift your head! Lift it! Now, turn! It ain't heavy! Right... left... duck! It doesn't hurt! It doesn't hurt! It doesn't hurt! Spin again! Again! I've told you a million times! It's not just one spin. It's two goddamn spins! That's impossible. You did it in the ring. Why can't you do it now?! How should I know?! Maybe I was possessed by something! The Revolver is the moneymaker! The fans love it! It doesn't hurt! It doesn't hurt! It doesn't hurt! It doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt! Tiger, I've got a cramp! Cuckoo, I've got a cramp, too! I've got a cramp, too! Don't let him lock you. It's all over if he has you in a lock. Cheer me on! Go, Tiger! Good luck! Where's Cuckoo? And for tonight's main match: He looks like a troll and he locks like a demon. The strongest contender after "Slayer" Joe Weah, the Japanese metrosexual... Mi-ya-moto! Cuckoo! Why?! It's not my fault! It's hers! Get back here and get to work! Wait, Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cheer me on! Cuckoo! Let me see you! Scum! Useless trash! Damn you! You're the useless trash! Miyamoto, you scum! Shake him loose! Shake him loose! He's screwed... Hang in there! Hang in there! Hang in there!

You'll be fine... you'll be fine... Popped it back in. Keep fighting. What the hell, Cuckoo?! Why are you cheering for that girly man?! Kill that Jap! I wasn't! Fight!

He's done for good! He's done! Please welcome Pearl and Ms. Zhao Ying! You've hurt your hip, too? I exerted too much switching guitars and tore my hip ligament. Totally worth it... in the name of music! This is a test of your vocal styles. Don't make any unnecessary movement. Sexier! Why do I feel sad when I think of you? If you love me... Sadder! I was once strong, but because of love... I became fragile Angrier! If there's room in your heart for me Crazier! Then I wouldn't be afraid of loneliness Peking opera! I won't resent you Copy that. Cuckoo! You're up. I'm going to be eliminated, Tiger. No way. You can sing, dance, strip. You can do anything! You can do tap, hip-hop, ukulele... You're Gaga, Madonna, Rihanna! You're a diva! He's the one that's afraid, not you! KO his ass, Cuckoo! - Do you still remember that place? - That's right. I ain't afraid! Do you still remember that place? Welcome Cuckoo and Mr. Qu Fengfeng! Tap!

Marinated duck! Fried chicken! Gimme that! Release! Pick up! Why didn't you call me back? You didn't even answer the phone. The power's been cut, Tiger! Our water got cut, too! We haven't showered in days! Debt collectors come by every day. The school's about to shut down. I don't want to eat steamed buns anymore. Whoa, MMA gloves! MMA gloves! There's a car! Tiger's back! Go Tiger! Come on, pull! Ready? One, two, three. Down! Pull! Lock! Does it hurt? Come on, OK! Are you OK? Next. Punch! Show your legs. Down! Don't tell me that you brats are learning that MMA crap? Hit me with that move again! If this is a real fight, you wouldn't know what move I'll pull! Let's do this for real, then! Come on! Tiger! Stop, Tiger! Stop, Tiger! Stop it! Stop! I'm the one that's antiquated, not boxing itself. What are you doing, Tiger?! You piece of shit! Trash! Idiot! Imbecile! How can you hit your master, you damn fool?! Useless trash! You ought to be killed and fed to the dogs! You're not trash! If it wasn't for you, I'd be on the streets. I miss my grandma, but I can't face her because I fell in love with a scumbag. I'm serious... you're the best man I've ever met. Really. You're really the best man I've ever met. Tiger. Tiger. I'm sorry. I've never been in love before... I've only been with hookers. You can't talk about hookers to a girl you like! You can't go around beating people up! And you can't swear all the time! Who the shit is it?! Hello, Miss Du. My boss would like to see you. Mr. Boyfriend, please step outside for a few minutes. This is my goddamn home! Miss Du, then... please step outside with me. I'm not going outside. Go to the attic! Cuckoo, honey! I'm so sorry! Please drop out! I'll pay! I can't stand the pressure! Take your boyfriend and go! I have writer's block! I'm seeing a shrink! Just go as far away as you can! I worked so hard to become an idol! Is the guy upstairs a gangster? Is he going to beat me up? I'll give you more money! Just go! Don't tell a soul about our past! I'll buy you a house! I've got plenty of money! Leave the planet! Go to Mars! You thief! You're stealing Cuckoo's songs again! I'm not! I gotta go! We have an agreement, then! Help! Don't do it, Tiger! Help! A gangster's attacking me! Break the door down! Get in here! The sheet music! Stop, you'll get arrested! Hurry! Don't move! Don't move! Please don't hit my face... Please don't hit my face... Please don't hit my face... Mr. Qu, Mr. Qu... Open the door. Move it! Get in there! I'll sue your ass off! Bet on it! Mr. King of Originality, what happened to your neck? I was rescuing a cat! Listen... you'd better get eliminated today. Or I'll make sure that Tiger gets 10 years in the slammer! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Tiger beat up ten guys all of a sudden! The guy with the lightest injury has 9 broken ribs! He's gonna be in jail for years! Mr. Gao, what's happened to Tiger? Please save him! I don't need you to tell me that! He's my money tree! I'm going to dinner with my big shot friends! Committing assault in front of all those people... Tiger wouldn't fight without a reason The cops were so efficient, they arrived right away. Cuckoo was off-key all of a sudden, but it was only c key. What happened to her... - She even broke into tears all of a sudden. - That's weird. Qu had a neck brace on all of a sudden, too. Did his spine get dislocated? Who should take the blame for that Cuckoo has been eliminated from the show! I'm disappointed in you, Cuckoo! I'm sorry. Tiger and Cuckoo were doing just fine a few days ago, now everything's over all of a sudden. So many "all of a suddens" all of a sudden. Isn't it odd? "Hi, everyone, I'm Qu Fengfeng!" I've packed your friend's stuff and numbered the boxes. They'll have no trouble finding them. I've cleared my debt to Mr. Gao. I have to go home to my granny. Can I take this? It brings me good luck. But that's my lucky charm. A hot pot restaurant isn't dangerous. It might blow up and go up in flames! Will you come to the restaurant opening? I have to focus on songwriting. I've wasted too much time. I'll cut the ribbon when yow open your 20th branch! Sure. I'll play your albums in all 20 stores. Good, but don't play pirated copies! Cuckoo! Good luck! You too, Tiger!

The clear soup is just like RaPuRaPu's! The spicy soup is as tasty as Shu Aroma's! That means I copied them perfectly! Enjoy! Come, come, come... Holy crap! Good thing I didn't let you fool me into this. It would've been the death of me! Trust me, you would've kicked his ass! You wanna fight him? Do ya? Hell no! Whoa! More where that came from! Come on! Steamed buns... No more steamed buns! You damn brats! Have some veggies. Come on! That's awesome! Yow think you can beat him, Tiger? No way! His thigh's thicker than my waist! Can I get a photo with you, Tiger? Tiger, that Spinning Revolver of yours is the bomb! Totally! Come on, let's get a photo! Tiger is out, but his master is in. World Games veteran Ma Qing versus Joe "Slayer" Weah! Master's on TV! Whoa! It's Master! My boxing school is my dream! And the prize money will revive that dream! That producer is a freaking genius! What a gimmick! Let's go! I'll tear that old man into pieces in 10 seconds! Ma Qing, you nutjob. You give me shit for MMA! And now you're going into that ring?! You're going to fight that nut without seeing a single match? He broke his last opponent's neck with a single punch! He has an entire team controlling his strategy, nutrition, his exercise routine. You don't even have a cornerman, just that damn sandbag. How will you fight him?! How?! I'm training you! Arm grip! Suck in your abs! Flip! Straighten your back! Grab the leg! Lock it! Hold the waist. Good. Go, Master! Ma Qing, World Games silver medalist in 2000... He opened a boxing school after retirement, training underprivileged kids from across the nation. - Tiger, The Gluttonous Boxer, is his student, too! - Go, Master! Remember, don't throw in the towel! He's here for the art of boxing! Tiger is here repaying his master, working as his cornerman against The Slayer. Let us welcome Tiger's master... Ma Qing! Ladies and gentlemen... Our next fighter has a perfect 22-0 record in his MMA career. In two of his matches in the US, his lethal pile driver killed one and paralyzed another! This is The Slayer, Joe Weah! Joe Weah! Joe Weah... Out of the way, old man! Fight me! Fight me! Come on! Come on, Tiger! Fight! Oh my God! That's the "Ma Combo Punches"! At the middleweight semifinal of the 2000 World Games, Ma used this to knock out his Cuban opponent! My God! My God! My God! My God! You son of a bitch! You bastard! He's already surrendered! I'll freaking kill you! Didn't you see the damn towel?! Get out of my way! - Fight me, Tiger! - I'll kick your ass! Come here! I'll kill you here and now! I'm not scared of you! What good does hurting him do?! - Come on, out of the way! - Fight me if you got the guts! - Come on, Tiger, I'll kill you! - Get out of my way! Weah! This is goddamn murder! I'll kill you! Come on! I'm going to avenge my master! Good night, Master. Good night, Master. You're gonna be rich, Tiger! I got you an amazing deal! Pipe down! This is a hospital! I've got a regimen in mind already. We'll start with a high-altitude simulation, then we'll get into battle yoga before wrapping it up with Muay Thai. We can add on Krav Maga, too! It'll be great! I don't need you to train me. No way! You're part of Gao's Boxing Gym... You'll still get paid. I'll leave you be, then! What should we eat? Soft-shell turtle! Again? How about wine-soaked crab, boss? Great! And karaoke after that! For the revival round, each judge will pick a former contestant and spring a surprise test on her for the audience. The one with the most votes returns! To whom is Zhao Ying giving this second chance? Opportunity favors the prepared mind. Sing, Cuckoo! I believe rainbows can appear even on cloudy days But all I see now is black and white I believe the future will be beyond our wildest dreams Pessimists don't stay pessimistic forever I believe I love This beautiful world has always existed for me I believe I love The ribbon is about to be cut on this elegant stage And I can't wait for it Because of you... The door to my dreams... opens in the blink of an eye A world with you loving me is a world worth cheering on This beautiful world has always existed for me It's not a matter of existence It depends on whether you love it or not Make them believe that our future is on the way I can't wait for it Because of you... The door to my dreams... opens in the blink of an eye A world with you loving me is a world worth cheering on A perfect era that belongs to me A perfect era... is made even better with love - A flower for life. - In exchange... - in exchange for a transformation. - A transformation...

Our main event on "Champion of Champions" came to a surprisingly brutal end. Ma looks to be seriously injured, but the crowd is still buzzing with excitement. I don't have the words to explain it. Don't fight him! I'll be fine! Good luck. Good luck. He's back to avenge his master! Please welcome back... The Gluttonous Boxer: Tiger! I can withstand my wounds... decaying endlessly I can't let my dreams become rusted... The days can be tough but I can't let life take me by the throat There is no weight class in this exciting championship fight, but the weight difference between Weah and Tiger is huge. Tiger is sticking to traditional boxing moves! He hasn't used a single kick, lock or tackle! He's fighting for his master! His dignity! This is too hard for him! He's truly at a disadvantage! Has it started? Let me see it. To defend his master's dignity, he's sticking to his fists. This is suicide! Defense... Tiger is forced to use MMA moves. He seems to be dizzy. To defend his master's dignity, he's sticking to his fists. This is suicide! Tiger is losing his consciousness. - You're up, Cuckoo. - He's a total mess. The two of us aren't that different One is dumb and the other is rash We're both chasing our dreams, but we're ordinary That's how we fell in love You see me ridiculed by the world I see you stand up for me You stopped being a hero to be my audience And now I know...
