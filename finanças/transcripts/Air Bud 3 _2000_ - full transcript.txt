WHO WILL BE THE NEW WORLD CUP CHAMPION ? CAN THEY DO IT ? [ Announcer #1 ] IT ALL COMES DOWN TO A SHOOTOUT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND NORWAY. AMERICAN GOALKEEPER BRIANA SCURRY WILL NOW FACE THE NORWEGIAN STRIKER... WITH HER TEAM DOWN TWO GOALS TO ONE. [ Announcer #2 ] AND THIS IS HUGE PRESSURE ON SCURRY. SHE NEEDS TO STOP THIS SHOT. [ Announcer #1 ] WHAT A SAVE BY SCURRY ! THE U.S.A. IS RIGHT BACK INTO IT. [ Announcer #2 ] NOW IT'S UP TO BRANDI CHASTAIN OF THE U.S. SHE HAS A CHANCE TO PULL THE AMERICANS EVEN AT TWO... IF SHE CAN PUT THIS KICK PAST THE NORWEGIAN KEEPER. [ Announcer #1 ] SHE SCORES ! JUST PAST THE OUTSTRETCHED HANDS OF THE GOALKEEPER, AND IT'S ALL TIED AT TWO. [ Announcer #2 ] THE PRESSURE SWITCHES TO BRIANA SCURRY, WHO FACES NORWAY'S FOURTH KICKER. SHE NEEDS TO STOP THIS ONE TO PREVENT THE NORWEGIANS FROM TAKING THE LEAD. [ Grunts, Groans ] [ Announcer #2 ] WAIT A MINUTE, FOLKS. SCURRY IS DOWN, AND SHE APPEARS TO BE INJURED. [ Groans ] [ Announcer #1 ] SHE'S SLOWLY GETTING UP, BUT SHE'S DEFINITELY IN A LOT OF PAIN. [ Announcer #2 ] THIS WILL BE A TERRIBLE BREAK FOR THE AMERICANS IF SHE CAN'T CONTINUE. NORWAY STILL HAS ONE MORE KICK, AND THINGS ARE NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR THE U.S. THE NEXT KICKER FOR THE STARS AND STRIPES IS TISHA VENTURINI. SHE'S BEEN IN THIS SITUATION BEFORE AND IS NO STRANGER TO THE PRESSURE. IF SHE CAN MAKE THIS ONE, THE AMERICANS CAN PULL AHEAD BY ONE GOAL... AND PUT THE HEAT SQUARELY BACK ON THEIR OPPONENTS. [ Announcer #1 ] AND SHE SCORES ! NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT ONE. WHAT A ROCKET. THIS REALLY PUTS THE AMERICANS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. [ Announcer #2 ] BRIANA SCURRY HAS MADE HER WAY BACK TO THE NET, BUT IT'S OBVIOUS... SHE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN. [ Announcer #1 ] THERE'S MOVEMENT AT THE U.S. BENCH.
