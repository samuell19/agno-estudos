So what are you writing? - [Teddy] A novel. I've been stuck at the last third for a long time. I just need some time to really nail it, you know? - [Leo] Yeah. Well, I don't write, but I know what you mean. - This is amazing. - Yeah. You'll be out here in the middle of nowhere for a while. - [Teddy] No kidding. - [Leo] You'll get a lot of writing done. - [Teddy] How long have you been acting? - [Leo] Oh, I've been trying for about four years now. - How's it going? - It's okay. I mean mostly small stuff. No commercials yet or anything. - Yeah, that must be tough. God, Leo, this is amazing. - Wait 'til you see inside. - Great. - [Leo] How about a drink? - [Teddy] What do you like to do here? - [Leo] Crispin pays me a bit to keep the place in shape. Lots of great hikes. Sometimes I play music and I like to dance. You know, in private. - [Teddy] Cool. - [Leo] I don't usually admit that. (mellow music) - Jesus. - [Leo] Yeah. - It just, you don't see this many stars in the city. Kind of puts things in perspective. (chuckling) - You must be exhausted. - I am gonna pass out soon. - Sorry we got so drunk. Was kind of my influence. - [Teddy] I like to drink too. Good thing I'm not staying. - You wouldn't get any work done. - It's be nice if you stopped by though. It could get lonely otherwise. - Yeah, I'll see.

(door slamming) (shouting) (whining) - [Teddy] Hello? - Hey, Leo, Teddy, just checking in on you. You got in okay? - [Teddy] Yeah, how's the writing going? - Great. Yeah, I've written some pages. Not as many as I'd like, but. - [Teddy] Well, it's only your first day. - Yeah. So you're going on any auditions or anything? - [Teddy] No, I gotta work this weekend. - When's your next day off? - [Teddy] (laughing) Are you lonely already? - Well, I mean, it's nice to have some human contact, you know. - [Teddy] You inviting me back out there? - Yeah, of course. I mean, by the end of this weekend, I'll have written 20 pages, that's amazing for me. This place is really inspiring. - [Teddy] Well, I'll plan on coming up on Monday, I'm not supposed to work again until Thursday. - Great. I mean, that should be cool. I guess I can handle being alone until then. - [Teddy] Well, call me if you need anything. - Okay, man, bye. - [Teddy] See ya. (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Crispin, it's Teddy. - Hello Teddy, how are you coming up? - God, I just have to tell you your house is amazing. Thanks so much for letting me stay here. - [Crispin] I'm glad you're using it, how's the weather? - Just what you think, hot and sunny. - Leo drive you? - He is very nice. You've known him awhile? - You know, I knew his parents. - Oh. I thought you could have been lovers once. - [Crispin] Oh no, he's like a little nephew to me. I could never do that. - Is he gay? - [Crispin] He's had girlfriends in the past. I think he's probably bi. Who isn't these days? You have to. - Yeah, but I shouldn't be telling you that. - [Crispin] Well, good luck figuring out the puzzle. - You know your shower doesn't work. - [Crispin] Changing the subject. It hasn't worked since the earthquake. I never bothered to fix it. I usually take baths when I go out there. - Where? - [Crispin] I do it with hot water from the hose. You stretch the hose out in the sun. The water's a decent temperature to bathe in. - Okay. - [Crispin] But there are thousands of hot springs you can go to, those are always nice. - Yeah. - And the writing? - Great. Couldn't be a better place for me to finish this damn thing. Thanks again so much. - Well, keep in touch, my dear. Anything you need, call Leo. He knows the house very well. - Okay.

I'm on a night schedule now. - You want a beer? - Sure. So how was work this week? - [Leo] Made a lot of tips. - Ever thought of doing a play? - Yeah, I've done a few. Why? - Just asking, thought it might be better than waiting for that commercial. - Well, yeah, usually. There's no money in it though. - Ever thought of doing something where money wasn't the main objective? - Yeah, all the time. I'm just getting tired of it. So what's your book about? - Basically about a crazy family from the Midwest, a family who crumbles when their son comes out as gay. - Autobiographical? - Yeah, a bit. So do you have a girlfriend? - I'm in between? - What was your last girlfriend like? - Nothing serious. - Did you like to dance with her? - No, she was into rock shows. - And you don't really dance at a rock show? - No, you sway. - (laughing) I like the way you do that. (both laughing) (soft music) How about something stronger? - Sure. - So have you only been with women? - Who wants to know? I've had my share of diverse experiences. - You're hard to read. - I used to think that everyone was bisexual, but women don't like to hear guys talk like that. - Yeah, I guess not. - So I don't talk about it much. - When you met me, did you think I was gay? - I don't know. A little maybe. - I'm totally gay. (both laughing) - Totally gay. - So tell me about your diverse experiences. - When I was 12, I used to fool around with this neighborhood kid. - [Teddy] Really? What did you do? - Well, we were talking one day about what do we feel like if a, if a girl sucked your cock, you know, just, just wondering about it and, and then he said, "Hey Leo, oh no, no, no. "Nevermind, nevermind." So of course I didn't know what he was gonna say. I had to pull it out of him and, and he said that if I wanted that he would suck my cock. - Where were you, what time of day was it? It was nighttime and we were right near my garage. So we went into my garage and he sucked my cock. (both laughing) - Did you like it? - Yeah! That was my first time, so I never forgot it, but then he wanted me to suck his, and I did, but I didn't like it. It was kind of smelly. (Teddy laughing) - What happened? Did you guys keep fooling around? - Here and there, yeah. - [Teddy] Did you ever go further than blowjobs? - No. Just touching and blowjobs. That's sweet. - It was what it was. - [Teddy] Whatever happened? Did you guys keep in touch? - Well, he became a total pothead and then I moved away and I heard that he got into heavier drugs after that. - Trying to deal with being gay. - You think? - Yeah. - So what about you? When did you know you were gay? - I think I was five. I was at a gas station with my mom and the gas station attendant. He was so beautiful. He had slick black hair and his pants were dirty with oil stains. He was smacking gum. And I told my mom that I wanted to take home the gas station man to be my dad. (Leo laughing) - You wanted to take the gas man home? - He was probably 20. - What did your mom say? - She shushed me and told me not to say things like that. - Keep it secret. - Yeah. For years, unfortunately. And when I was 19 and tried to come out, she told me that I wasn't gay. I've never been with a girl and how can I know for sure? Fucking a nightmare. - So what'd you do? - Went to college and became asexual. Want another? - Yeah. That really sucks, man. - What's that? - You know, having to repress yourself like that. - Yeah. But eventually it reached a breaking point and that's where my novel happens, then the aftermath. - So what happened? - I don't want to give it away. - Okay. - This is a truth serum. (laughing) - Yeah. (both chuckling) - So are we just gonna stay here all night and get drunk? - We should do something else, right? - Yeah.

Otherwise what's the point? You want to be buried or cremated? - I want to be buried at sea. You? - Cremated. Just seems easier. - You think about death a lot. - Sort of.

Why would someone want to kill her? - Yeah. Fucked up things happening in the world. But I think everything happens for a reason. - You think that she was killed for a reason? - I don't think that she deserved to die, but it was just her time. - Her time. - Yeah. I mean, we all have to die. Sometimes it's by accident, car crash or something. - Struck by lightning. - Yeah. - Do you think that there's always a reason? - I think that we need to be good to each other while we're on the planet.

He's arriving in a few days and since you have keys I was hoping you could pick him up and bring him to the house. Open it up, show him the premises. - What would you do if I couldn't pick them up? - [Crispin] I have some other friends who stay there. They might help, I just thought since you stay there so often you know the place better than me. - Okay, yeah, yeah, I can pick him up. - [Crispin] You're a doll. He arrives on the 4:00 PM bus Tuesday. - Okay, I'll be there. - Where are you going? - Crispin's. - [Cheryl] So you'll stay there overnight. - Yeah. - You're always going out of town.
