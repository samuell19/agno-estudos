You ever get a friend request like they live in a different country? - Yeah you're like how do I know you? How did you even find me on Facebook? - I've never tried to add some Mexican person. - They always add me so I just say YOLO. - YOLO. So you add them up? - I add some Mexicans. - Like "Oh yay this 50-year-old pedophile wants to whack off to my profile picture!" "Add! Accept!" - Maybe he can send me some awesome Mexican stuff. - Some awesome Mexican stuff... He'll send you his taco. Fucking hurt! - No doubt. - Yeah. - Ugh... - Alright you ready? - I don't know. - Come on. - You're probably way stronger than me. - He just did it. You're way stronger than him... as you can see. Just do it. - OK. - Get up! That's my boy. - Need help? Thwart! Let's go again. - No. No. - If you won't fight him fight me.

Where was your helmet? - That's what I was saying. - Oh dear... - That's a Darwin prize here. How can you not wear a helmet? - I was like making one of those really quick things where you just don't need to put it on. - Yeah I do that in a car a lot too. I'll be driving alone and I don't have the roof on and I'm not wearing a seatbelt. Sometimes I don't even put the engine in I just go. So, do you live up here? - Uh no I'm actually just visiting for the summer. - You come up every summer? - No it's my first summer. - Oh. - Yeah I'm visiting my grandma and my cousin. - Oh great yeah.

You don't turn around and destroy your homework like that. - It's stupid. - Well I don't care if it's stupid or not you gotta get it done. Let me borrow that. - It's because of our teacher. - I don't think it's the teacher's fault I think it is your fault. - I didn't do anything. - Exactly. Why do you think you failed? - I did work. I didn't do anything wrong that's what I mean. Like how did you pass? You're a retard. - I guess I'm not. - That angers me. - You failed twice. Not even once, 'twice'. - Well if you wanna sit here and keep being bored keep talking. Keep chirping. You wanna go outside you wanna go do something like you want? Is that what you wanna do?

Don't do what I did. You're at that age you gotta have fun. She's cute. - Yeah but we're just friends. - She's cute. - OK... - Yeah I don't mind an Easter bunny coming in and leaving me chocolate. - You'd rather a bunny just snooping around your house shitting out chocolate everywhere? You're just like "Oh look at this a goody!" Can't beat it! You know every time you touch yourself an angel loses its wings. - I'm touching myself right now. - I don't think that's what he meant. - No man you gotta go home turn lights off you know make sure your mom's sleeping or something maybe get her to cook you a meal so she's occupied go into your room turn a movie on start slowly working your way down you know. - He didn't get it. - I got it!

Who is it? - Nate. - Nate! - Yeah. - What's up buddy? - How are you? - What's going on brother? - How you doing? - Come on in. Gentlemen. Welcome. - You still got a pretty sick crib.

Um I was thinking like... a half quarter. - What are we thinking here? - Seven for fifty. - Seven for fifty?! Nate man who is your sidekick here man? - It's my cousin Riley man. He's cool. - What's up man? You got some stiff prices though. Seven for fifty come on what do you take me for? How about we go like what it usually is six for fifty? - "How about we just go..." How about you just scale that shit up? - Already scaled man. - No. - Yeah. What are you talking about? That's hardly scaled. Look at that. How much time did it take you? - Who's your brother back there man? - Adam. - Adam? Are you cool bro? - Uh yeah. - So did you actually jump Todd's Cliff or what? - Yeah man I jumped it. Of course I did. Nate you didn't tell this guy? - Oh I did. - Only two people have ever done it before man. Todd who's not even here to say it... Only one guy is and that's me. You're looking right at him man. - I told you man. He's a fucking legend. - Easily 120 feet. - So what was it like when you hit the water anyway? - Oh man it was like nothing you ever felt before. It was like a thousand swords digging into my feet man. Not too many times people get the opportunity to prove something and I did that day. - Come on Riley! I told you he wouldn't do it! Just fucking push him! - I don't know. Is there a way I can just go back down or something? - That's the only way down man. - Come on you coward inbred twat just jump! I'm not waiting all day for you! - Seriously I just can't though. Like my body just won't let me jump. - Look if you jump the worst that's gonna happen is that you might get physically injured. If you don't jump then there'd be a 100% chance that Nate's gonna mentally abuse you all summer for not jumping. - You worried your tampon's gonna get wet bud? Come on just jump! OK let's do this. - Alright I'll count you down. Ready? Three, two, one, jump! - Go go go! Aw! - Ha ha ha! - Ah! Shit! - Ugh! - You always use your whole body. - I'm fucking little!

I mean I don't know I wouldn't want to ruin the friendship or anything. - I don't know. Should take the opportunity while it's open before it closes. - Yeah it's just hard to tell somebody that you like them when you're friends and... you don't really know how to tell them. - If it was me I would just go up and be completely honest. - What are you guys doing? - Nothing just talking. - About what? - I don't know. Wanna just go over there jump on the trampoline or something? - A tiny little moth on your arm and it lands for two seconds or a huge tarantula on your face... - Well the moth obviously then. But if it was like an equally sized moth and tarantula I'd pick the tarantula. - Are you kidding me? - No. It's creepy and... like... spiders are kinda cute like the fuzzy ones that like you just wanna pet them and... - Pet a spider? - Would you pet a moth? No you would not. - Yeah I would. - No you wouldn't. Don't lie. - They're like little fluffy butterflies. - They're like little creepy butterflies from hell that's what they are actually. - Why do you hate them so much? - He's like... he is creepy like he stares at me when I go in to buy something at the store and he gives me weird looks all the time.

It's like Christmas. - Man that thing looks like a haggard vagina. - No doubt. Give her a white dragon. - What's a white dragon? - Um it's when she's giving you head and then when you start coming you just start going right hard in the paint so it comes out her nose you know? I'd fuck Taylor too. - Who wouldn't? - Adam's the one that wants to fuck her out of all three of us the most. He's just probably the only one here without a shot. - Man I think Shanna would be the easiest one to get with. - Obviously. I mean fucking Taylor argh... you gotta talk to her and listen and shit fucking try to deal with problems work it out... No fuck too much effort. Way too much effort. Just her body that's the only thing that would be worth it man. - Yeah she's got a pretty nice body. - Yeah. - You like her? - Not even man. Just gonna fucking make her my cum dumpster and chuck her. Sometimes you just gotta put a little effort in. - You only put effort in if it's actually gonna be worth it. Look at this kid. He's been fucking following her around for how long? How often do you guys hang out? - I don't know. - Hang out alone anytime? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? Fuck her yet? - No. - No? Sleepovers and shit? - No. - No? Go to her house, she comes to your house? - Go to your room fucking turn the lights off start undressing her and shit... - No we're just friends. - You sure? What if she wants to fuck you and you're just too bitch? You could fuck her you just haven't made a move. Oh that one's got him thinking. Come on man like get fucking mad! Like we're sitting here talking about your girl and you just sit there and fucking watch us give a little smile like "Yeah don't talk about her like that man." You gotta do something stand up for yourself once. Like just once actually do something. You're 15 years old and you have a bedtime. You gotta be inside by 10 o'clock so your mom can tuck you in by 10:30. Like get mad for once man! You're not angry about that or anything? You can't do anything. You do anything you get bitched at. You anger me. I don't know what it is it's just like you. You just piss me off. Like even just your face just makes me mad I don't know what it is. So fucking sad. - Oh shit. - Go to sleep! - Crazy man. Savage. Oh calm yourself. - Good catch. Whoa! Wanna put some effort into this? Jeez! OK maybe not so much effort. Hey, talk to me. What's the matter? You know your mother and I worked really hard to put this together for us. We come up here we're having a good time all you do is mope around. What the hell is wrong with you? - I saw you at the fireworks. - What are you... what are you talking about? Do you think maybe... Think maybe you wanna go somewhere else so we can talk about this privately? - Nope I'm perfectly fine right here. Does Mom know? - Does Mom know what? - Do I have to explain it? 'Cause I'm pretty sure that you know exactly what I'm talking about. - OK something stupid might've happened. We were drinking everybody was drinking it was... stuff happens. - I understand exactly what happened I just... - Adam Adam. I've made a mistake and I admit it. But between you and me this is that time in your life where you gotta think about what's going on... It's bigger than... it's bigger than... It's a... it's a big mistake and I admit it but bringing your mom into it isn't gonna help it's gonna make things really bad trust me. You gotta think about the ramifications. You go telling your mom stuff like this you think of what's gonna happen. You think about it. You... Adam! Adam! - Oh! - Riley what are you doing? - What are you doing? - Get down! Just get it in donut! - Ready? Here man. Alright what can I get now? - What are you doing? I'm good luck eh? - I don't know. Dude stop. - Where'd you get this? - Riley. - Riley got it for ya? - Yeah. - Why? - 'Cause he's my actual friend. - Your actual friend? - Yeah. - Not pretend or anything are you sure? - Pretty sure. - Pretty sure. - He's way nicer than you cooler than you smarter than you. Stop... - Those are some real good character traits eh? Where is your actual friend Riley? And your actual friend Taylor? Walking around the arcade doing nothing? All alone you know? Just hanging out drinking a juice box? I wonder where they could be. Your elephant man. - Fuck! Fuck you. - Adam, your dad and I want to have a conversation with you. We're concerned and we know that something has gone on this week. It's important that you give us your version and you tell it exactly like it happened. OK? - Your mother is referring to the gas station incident the theft of the, alcohol. - What are you smiling about? - Nothing. - Adam look at me. Come on. I need the truth. - What... - What's the joke? - What's so funny? - You want me to be honest? - I want you to tell me what happened. In your own words. - He says he didn't do it. - Come on Adam. I understand this was something that you didn't want to do but... - But he says he didn't do it. No I'll go get all of them I'll view the video with them we'll take care of this. You're getting all upset. If he says he didn't do it that's good. And if he's caught on the tape we'll take care of it then. - Yeah I'd like to take care of it now. I think that this is an important family matter that we talk about being honest and being there for each other. - You have his answer. Are you gonna change your answer son? - I didn't do anything. - How's Adam doing? - Uh I think he's doing good. - Yeah? - Why? - I don't know. Have you noticed a change in him at all? - Uh no not really. Seems to be doing good. - Anyway what happened at the liquor store? You mind telling me? - Uh... nothing just... me and Nate were having a little fun. - Was Adam involved with that? - No not really. - Hmm OK. What's with the bad stuff? What's the point? - What do you mean? - I don't know I just think having fun is having fun but... I don't know stealing liquor... what's up? Are you doing it 'cause you think it's "Mr. Cool Gangster" stuff and you're gonna get the chicks? What's the story? You getting the girls? See you're being bad and you're not getting the girls. - Yeah I'm. - No you took too long to answer. You are not. You got any idea what you wanna do in the future? - Uh probably something with like cooking. - Seriously? Where'd that come from? - I don't know my dad taught me how to do it when I was a kid so I just... - Is he a cook? - No it's just something that he always loved to do. - That's great. A badass who cooks. - Yeah. - Ooh yeah. Seriously, you know you can do good. I've seen it. You should try doing good. You're a good kid. - You... kind of like go through boys like crazy to be honest. - Oh fuck you. I didn't... - I'm not trying to be mean or anything, but you've had a lot of boyfriends and... - You're not trying to be mean or anything except you are so... - I'm not. I'm just trying to tell you that... I just don't want him getting hurt 'cause he's my friend too. I know you and I know your personality and I know that if you and Riley date then... something will happen and a bunch of drama will happen. - You can't really say that. You can't see the future. - No but I've seen the past and trust me the future's not gonna be that different. - I can't go to bed man. If I could go to bed I'd go to bed. Let's go out and do something. Like a little bitch. Like a 6-year-old girl falling asleep at rookie times. Get up. So you just wanna fucking lie here? - Pretty much. - Do nothing like... Let's go out man! This sucks so much! Now you're chilling with that little goody two-shoes turning into a little bitch. And what? You hooked up with one girl and now you're falling in love with her like... - I'm not fucking falling in love with her man. - Yeah right! Go hand her the prenup bud! This was supposed to be a summer of us hanging out and chilling and now what are we doing? Let's go out I'm bored! - You're not bored you're just fucking boring man. Go to bed. Look man we're all gonna hang out tomorrow. You should come. It'll be fun. Taylor and Adam are gonna be there. Smoke a bowl or something after. Chill out. You down? - Five. Anyone?

So Nate you get to put down a road. From your house. Good choice. Alright. No no once you take your hand off then it's done. You can't change your mind. - I didn't know that. - Yeah. Well it's part of the rules. When you put it down and you take your hand off it's like chess it's done. Everybody you put your piece down you take your hand off the game that's it right? - Six. Going with the... - So Nate what are you thinking about doing when you are all grown up? - Um... I was thinking about being an astrophysicist. - Really? That's super cool. - Just knowing that the unknown is out there try to figure out what it is you know? - So you must really enjoy math. - Uh no not really at all. - No? Oh well. - Well being an astrophysicist is like 100% math so... - So what? - Didn't you fail math? - Yeah what's your point? - Yes! - Um... are you gonna... - Alright you get some wheat my friend. That is good. - That's not where your piece was. - What do you mean? - I mean that's not where your piece was. - Man I have roads leading to that house and everything. - You have one. - It's fine what are you talking about? - He added a piece right there. It's not fine. - I think it looks alright. - Well of course you do. - I don't see a difference. - It was not there man I don't know what to tell you like... When I added a little road it was such a big deal over a road but your little butt buddy starts cheating and all of a sudden "Oh no it's all good just keep playing don't worry about it." - What are you talking about? - He's fucking cheating that's what I'm talking about man! - Can you watch the language? - Like honestly how old are you? Go get some hearing aids! - Nate... - Fuck! - Calm down man. - Wow. - Nate just relax. - Don't tell me to relax. - Man don't even bring her into this. - She brought herself into it. - Take your tile man. - No. It's not even my tile. Like this is the stupidest game I've ever played. - This isn't even your house don't even talk like that. - Exactly. Look who you're sitting around with man. - Real people. - Real people? The girl that couldn't make up her mind between you two the one that has absolutely no clue what's going on around here. The fish fucker... - Hey! - And the goody two-shoes. What? You have no fucking clue man. - You don't talk to me like that in my house. - Oh your amazing house? You wanna keep it? I could ruin your life. Stay out of this. Sit back and enjoy your fucking game. This is none of your business. - Nate... - Why don't you just leave? No one even wants you here so just leave. - Nobody wants me here? - Yeah. - You know where you come from and you're fucking chilling with these people. - Yeah I didn't want to come from where I came from. - Take a look around man. Whose house are you living in? - I'm living at your grandma's house. - Guess what we don't want you anymore either. - You're not living with your parents either. - You're a fucking loser hanging out with these tools. - At least I'm fucking wanted. - Nobody here wants you man. - Wanted by who man? Your dad? Where's your dad? Where's your dad Riley? Your dad couldn't even handle being alive thinking that he has such a fuckup of a son somewhere out there that he had to end his life. I can understand why he did it. Fuck all you guys this is fucking stupid. - Fuck man! - What? - Riley! - Fuck you! - Riley... - Look just fuck off I don't wanna talk about it OK? - Did you know that stuff about him? - Yeah because we talk every day. That's the difference between knowing his name and knowig him. - I know stuff about him that you don't know. Like we talk. Like he wouldn't tell you stuff that he tells me. - Are you sure you wanna say that? - Well yeah I mean... - If you actually hung out with him and you actually knew him then you probably would never wanna see him again. Riley said that the only reason he wants to date you is that he can sleep with you and then brag about it with all his friends so that's why he chose you over Shanna 'cause he thought that you'd be an easier lay or something like that. I didn't get involved with this but this is what they were saying and you think "Oh I have a little cute boyfriend." Yeah right. - Look like if you're trying to break us up right now it's not... - I'm not trying to break you up. I'm not trying to do any of that crap. I'm telling you the ugly truth. You just don't wanna take it. You run over there looking like a little idiot all clueless thinking he wants you. 'Cause he doesn't. You're gonna come to me for advice and you're not gonna take it again. - You know you claim to be his best friend and you say you talk all the time every day and you hang out every day but he just had his heart ripped out in there and his entire past thrown onto the table for everyone to judge and you're still making it about you. It's always about you. - He called you a cum dumpster. - Fuck you Adam. - You gotta pinch your nose here so that... I can get that bleeding to stop OK? Otherwise that nose is never gonna stop. - Ah... - Oh don't be such a wimp about it. This is what happens when you and Riley start. You start playing and playing and playing and before you know it one of you guys is bleeding. - Look man have you talked to Taylor lately? - Not really. Why? - Just 'cause I heard... Shanna was telling me that she doesn't want to talk to me. She said that... Taylor said that I said a whole bunch of stuff about her. If it was you I won't be mad I just... - No it wasn't me. - I just wanna get it cleared up. - It wasn't me. - You sure? - Yeah I didn't say anything. Maybe... Nate did when he got really mad. - Doesn't seem like something he would do. He wouldn't go behind my back and try to ruin something that I have. I mean he's family right? - Yeah but look at my family. Like it doesn't matter if they have the same blood as you. If they don't act like family then what's the point? - I don't know it just seems like I've lost everybody. - You have me. - Sup boys? Nate can I talk to you for a minute? Look man it's important. Just come outside for a minute. Man just take a break like come outside. - I'm in the middle of something very important man. - Fine I'll pause it. - Are you serious? Like... - Man what did you say? Like Taylor won't even talk to me. - What did you expect man? Like, honestly. - I don't know what's going on but you need to plug that in. - I'm not plugging shit back in until he talks man. - Plus it back in I talked. - Riley man listen it might just be me but I don't think Nate wants to talk to you and I'm not really having fun anymore. - Does it look like I fucking care if you're having fun man? I'm trying to have a conversation. - Why don't we just roll a joint and chill out man? - 'Cause I don't wanna smoke a joint of your shitty weed man. Come on like you're a loser. All you do is sit here and sell drugs to kids all day. - Don't talk to Brad like that man. He's a legend. - He's not a legend he jumped off one fucking cliff. - Let's see you do it. - I would. - Heard that before man. Tell you what I got a boat outside. I'll drive you out there right now, if you wanna go. - Right there you got a ride and you're still bitchin' out. Why aren't you hopping up ready to run out the door and go jump off the big cliff? - Why don't you come jump with me? - Huh! Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. You jump I'll jump. 100%. - 100%. - Welcome to Todd's Cliff. It doesn't... I can't even film it in one frame. - Go home before you make yourself look like the fool. - Let's get to the top already. - I don't wanna embarrass you on camera and everything but I mean shit happens. Sorry. - Are your knees shaking? - So how does it feel to know that you're gonna bitch out? - I'm not gonna bitch out. - It's OK to be scared I understand. You know? - You're the one who seems scared man. You're making excuses. I'm saying let's jump. - Yeah? And I'm saying that you're not gonna. - Recording let's go! - Man why you always gotta fuck things up? - It's fun. - Fuck man you don't care about anybody but yourself. You think everything's a big joke but this isn't a joke. This isn't the time to laugh. - You're obviously not gonna jump it. Like look how high it is man. - Who's going first? - You know you're not gonna prove a point by doing this. - Nobody gives a fuck about your opinion! Stay out of this. - You're the one who dragged me up here. You're the one that fucking... talked shit like usual until I came up here. So you know what? I'm up here I'm ready to jump let's jump. - Man... we're not doing this. We've done a lot of stupid shit but this tops the list like... no this isn't even on the list. This is ridiculous. And if you think I'm gonna think less of you for not jumping this I'm not man. Let's just walk back down man. Nothing's gonna change. - That's the point. Something's gotta change. - No you're coming with me. - No the only way I'm going is that way. You don't have to do this. - Yes I do. - Well count it down then. - Three... - Two... - One. Fuck. - You did it man! One second. How do you feel bro? - Fucking terrible. Get me the fuck outta here. - Alright. - Man! - Say something to the camera brother. - I'm hurt... - Oh fuck! That was high as fuck. - You guys did it man! - Holy fuck. - Told you I would. - Fucking crazy. - Good job Nate. Respect brother. - That's the pain of jumping Todd's right there man. - Did you see that man? - Are you guys OK? - How come you didn't jump too? - Can't believe we just did that. - Can't believe you guys did that either. - It was crazy bro. - Told you I was going to. - Adam how did it look from the top man? - Really scary. - Come on man talk to your audience man. You just did it! - I did it. - Yeah you did! I don't think I looked as bad as you guys man. Holy shit. - How'd it look from the bottom? - It was crazy from the bottom man. - I didn't think we were ever gonna hit. What about you? - Nate! Nate get up man! Nate! Nate are you OK? We gotta get out of here. - Yeah. - I'm good. - Try to sit up. Sit up man. - I'm good. - You don't look good man. - Get him off the boat. - Come on man. Someone help! - I don't know what they were... they were playing on the cliffs and they were jumping off the cliffs and he turned around and jumped off and it had something to do with his internal... I don't know. He... he bled to death. Yeah Riley's here right now. I just don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know. Yeah I gotta... I gotta phone his mom and dad now. I don't know what I'm gonna say to them. I was supposed to be watching him and I didn't. - Hi. - Hi can I come in? - Um... sure. Did you want to say something to me? - He just jumped and... if I didn't lie then he'd be having fun with his friends and I'd be having fun with my friends and everybody would be perfectly fine and he'd still be alive and... - It wasn't your fault. - You don't understand. There's something wrong with me. - It's gonna get better. You're gonna feel better. OK? Um... - Do you love him? - No. - Riley? - Get the fuck outta here. - What are you doing? - Stuck what's it look like? - You OK? - Just get the fuck outta here man.
