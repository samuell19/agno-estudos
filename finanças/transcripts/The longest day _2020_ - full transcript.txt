My peace is gone, My heart is sore: I never shall find it, Ah, nevermore! Margaret, Faust I THE LONGEST DAY Iris, where are we going? Just a bit longer. I think this is scary. Don't whine. What if we get lost? Mom will get angry. Don't be ridiculous. I know where we are. We can pass here. Can we go back now? -Quit it. But where are we going? You'll find out soon. What's that? A stone, of course. But how did it get up there? How would I know? Maybe some giant put it there. Yeah, right. Look. Stop it! Stop it! That's not funny. Iris, stop it! I'll call mom. Iris! Yes, Atman. You're a good dog. Such a good dog. Atman... Midsummer's Eve... What? Midsummer's Eve. What about it? Nothing. God dammit! Did you hurt yourself? He's eating the trash! Mensch! Good dog. Aren't you gonna say goodbye? Goodbye. Mensch! Mommy. Let her sleep. When's daddy coming? Tonight. We need to clean up here. What are you doing there? -Nothing. Look at the sun! How much it has risen! And it's only morning. Nearly there! When? Soon. Any moment now... There! Now we're north of the arctic circle! How about that, huh? What a beautiful day this is going to be! Dammit... How hard can it be to find a tree? Nothing is sacred. She's quite unrelenting today. Yes. And the whole day, too. Kisses. -See you later. Bye! -Bye. Good morning! Good morning! Good morning. Good morning. -Hi. Good morning. -Good morning! Good morning, Aina. Welcome! -Thank you. Hi. -Welcome! Welcome! Good morning. Welcome! -Thank you Good morning. Jani, can you please come to cash register 2? They're here again. Yes. Yeah. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Johannes Happy birthday to you Happy birthday! -Thank you. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, Johannes! -Thanks. Should you blow out the candles? -Oh, yes. What are you doing there? What are you doing? Shouldn't we tell mum? No, it will be a surprise. So much trash. Anything last night? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing... What's this? Hey! You! Come here. Who did this? Did what? Who removed the barrier? Who took away the protective barrier? I don't know. This is an unprotected hole. That's dangerous. This isn't okay. Someone could fall in the hole, don't you see that! Now, you'll stand guard here - while I go and find out who's responsible for this. Jani, can you please come to cash register 2? Hey. Hey! Jani, can you please... LIBRARY Hi. I want to know more about John. Which John? The one who baptized. We don't have anything in stock exclusively about him. But I could put in an order. -No, I need it now. Well, there's a bit about him in the Bible. Do you have a Bible? I'm a truck driver. I need an audiobook. Do you have one of those? Yes, as a matter of fact we do. Do you want the whole thing, or just the Old or the New Testament? Whichever tells most about John. Ok, let's continue. Ladies and gentlemen - welcome to the first round of the Midsummer Cup! Forty contestants face off against each other - and the winner of each duel will advance to the next round. I've been thinking about something. You never smile anymore. I guess I'd smile if I thought something was funny. This isn't good. Not at all. No one can come here and fix it today. We have to guard the hole ourselves. You got this? Good, good... Jani, can you please come to cash register 2? Hey! Watch the hole, will you? Nothing. Now, I'm going to tell you what this is. I've read about this on the Internet. You know what this is? A moose trap. You know how it works? Well... A moose comes walking along like this - and then it sees this tree. And it feels that its fur is itching. You know, the way your back can itch sometimes - but you can't reach to scratch it. The moose goes up to the tree to scratch itself - and then he rubs up against the trunk. And then... That's how it is. Now John himself wore clothing made of camel's hair - with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. Then people from Jerusalem - all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. They were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins. Locusts? Well, Atman? But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism - he said to them: "You offspring of vipers - who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" Offspring of vipers? What on earth is this? Atman? Goddammit... "Therefore bring forth fruit worthy of repentance! Don't think to yourselves - 'We have Abraham for our father' - for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham - from these stones. Even now the axe lies at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that doesn't bring forth good fruit - is cut down and cast into the fire. Oh-oh. Where are we going? -You'll see. Come on! Every year, there are over ten thousand road accidents involving wild animals. The costs for these accidents exceed 100 million euro yearly. The Fauna passage 2000 bridge could halve the costs. Fauna passage 2000. We care about the wild animals in your county - and your municipality's economy. One year of planning. Six months of research. Six months construction time. And at a cost of 1.6 million euros. 1.6 million euros of tax-payers' money. And now, one year later - precisely zero crossings on this "essential" bridge. Now... We are aware of the situation in your personal life right now. But things just can't go this wrong. We made use of - all the available statistics. Studied the data carefully, of course. All the figures. Followed sightings. This was the right location for the bridge. It was an empirical truth. So what happened? I don't know. You don't know? A miracle? Is that it? All the moose just suddenly changed their passage route, or what? I don't have an answer. My great grandfather planted this forest when he was young. My grandfather thinned it. Oh my, the fallen brave world. Oh my... Don't you think anything's fun? No. Nothing at all? No. I have fun sometimes. Like when? Well... When it's summer. And it's warm. And you get to drink beer. And get a little drunk. Don't you think that's fun? No. Then I always wake up soaking wet - and I'm in pain and I don't know where I am. Does that sound like fun to you? I think my grandma's fun. There's nothing fun about your grandma. Well... How does it feel? What? Retirement? The final journey? Isn't that the name of a film? You gonna miss me? Atman will miss me. Let's go. -You're not gonna say goodbye? Bye then. Life swings back and forth between bleakness and suffering. Life without pain has no meaning. Tragedy is a part of life itself. Well, well. It's cleaning day. Hi. -Hi there. Hi. Itâ€™s never too late to start cleaning up. That's a great truth. Cleaning up is for fools, a genius masters the chaos. In practical life, a genius is about as much use as a telescope at the theater. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the second round of the Midsummer Cup! As we all know, the watercross race is run in groups of four drivers. Each contestant has to go around the yellow buoys from the right side - and the red buoys from the left side. In each start, the driver needs to drive through a ramp at least once. Otherwise, they will be disqualified. And as always, we remind you - to use hearing protectors or at least earplugs. I'm quitting. I don't think this is fun. I quit. This thing's seriously dangerous. You need to put a protective barrier around the entire hole. We had one. Had one? -Had one. Why'd you take it away? I don't know. I don't even know who did it. I can't take responsibility for this. You'll have to close the store. We're not closing. We just need someone to guard the hole. So nobody falls in. I'll need a chair. Get her a chair. Get her a chair! Jani, can you come to cash register 2? -Excuse me. That's it. Hi. Well, that's 35% less for you today. But that's understandable. -Yeah, yeah. Fucking assholes. I hate them. It is what it is. But we need to increase the profits. You know that, too. -Yeah. You can't slow your way out of a crisis. I don't make the rules. They're watching me like a hawk. Those tree huggers are like a bunch of mosquitoes - that we have to shoo away if we can't squash them. But we need to increase the profits. Yes. Of course. I'm really not much of a speech giver - but I think I speak for everyone - when I say that this is an extremely great day. For we get to plant this warden tree. For those of you who don't know what a warden tree is - I can tell you that it was a common fixture of yards and parks - in the last century. If you took good care of the warden tree - it would protect you from evil and misfortune. But if you treated it badly, then the opposite could happen. We thank chairwoman Meri - and the Friends of the Trees association - for this beautiful donation. May it stand as a testament to stability - for centuries to come. Long live the tree! Fucking tree huggers! That's my parasol. -What do you need a parasol for? You, who just run around all the time. You, who never partake in its shade. You can't just take my parasol. We didn't take your parasol. We borrowed your parasol. Makes no difference. I want it back. You just never give up. But why? But why? "Es irrt der Mensch, solang er strebt." A great truth. I want to go to the sea. With this? That's not possible. It's possible. That's like 250 km on water. What's the world record? I don't know. I don't care. You'd need like 50 liters of fuel. Two extra cans. Refuel while you're driving. Want me to set it up? No. I'll do it myself. Jani, can you please come to cash register 3? What is it? Yeah, could you come to cash register 3? But what's the matter? Why do you ask? What do you need help with? What can I help you with? Yeah, do we have any Lucia crowns in stock? Lucia crowns? Yes. Who the hell wants Lucia crowns on Midsummer's Eve? Hello? Yes. Can you come to cash register 3? No, I'm in a meeting right now. Do we have any Lucia crowns in stock? No! We don't sell Lucia crowns on Midsummer's Eve! Hello? We don't sell Lucia crowns on Christmas Eve! Christmas Eve? I meant Midsummer's Eve! Hello? Jani, can you please come to cash register 3? Hi there! Hi! Are you going to work now? Well, some of us have to work. Don't get burned out. Come have a beer! There's enough for you too! No, thanks. What is this place? -Look. Really nice paintings. Hi. -Hi. Hi. This will turn out great. Come. -Huh? Come. Stand here. Good. This will be perfect. Let's go. Bye bye! -Bye. Bye bye. Easy, Atman. Everything is fine. Sisko! Sisko! Aarre! Aarre! Hello! Mommy? Honey! Everything is fine. I just have to rest a little while longer. Imagine a calm beach by the sea. The sand is warm beneath your feet. The waves lap gently against the shore. A soft breeze caresses your face. You breathe slowly - and feel with each breath how you become more and more relaxed. This is Meri. Now we'll see her perform. Let's give her a big hand. Have you ever seen a jacket like this before? In the olden days you had to wear one of these if you were mad. It was meant to restrain you. So you couldn't go around doing crazy things. You can't take it off without help. They wore jackets like this at a place called a lunatic asylum. Do you know what a lunatic asylum is? No one? Great! That means you're not crazy! Hey! Do you think I can get out of this strange jacket? What do you think? Look back here! Okay, let's see. Shazaam! Can you drop me off at my Grandma's house? You wanna come in for a cup of coffee? All she does is throw shoes at me. She probably hasn't quite forgiven you - for getting so drunk at Grandpa's funeral. Aren't you coming in? -Come on. Will I see you at the workshop tomorrow? No, you can take time off. But I'll come in on Monday. No, that's not necessary. You don't have to show up for a while. What are you doing out there? The coffee is getting cold! God damn! Come on now. And bring the shoe! I was going to close up. But it's fine if you want to stay for a while. Can I help you with something? Today - I've been thinking a lot about that John. Alright. I know almost nothing about him, but today I've thought about him. I see. He was - a remarkable person. He ate locusts. That can't have been much fun. Was he - ill-tempered? I don't know about ill-tempered but... Somewhat stern, perhaps. It's my birthday today. And my name day. I see. Happy birthday! I should be closing up - but if you want to stay for a while, that's fine. Is there something weighing on you? Honey, mum had to rest a bit. Nice. It's for Iris! I'm going out for a bit. Is that all right? Ladies and Gentlemen. It's just us. You don't have to put on airs. Stairs. It's a stone age invention to enable vertical movement. It has seen its last days in this store. From now on, moving vertically in this store will be done in a different way. Can't you just say up and down? -Hush now. We'll use an invention that has existed for over a hundred years. Your days of toiling are over. Here's an example. Berlin, 1925. Tomorrow, that is going to be me! Looks like Hitler, come to think of it. Is that Hitler? "Next step". This, ladies and gentlemen, is the very latest in escalator design! Life is an enterprise that doesn't cover the costs. Life isn't meant to be lived. It's meant to be endured. The job of a writer is not to recount big events - but to make small events interesting. Didn't you borrow that from the library? How's it going? Good. No one has fallen into it. Well... You can go now. I'll take over for the final hour. And... Thank you. Who's there? Come in! Who's bothering me? Come in! Thrice must the words be spoken! Come in, then! Bravo! Thus thou pleasest me. I hope we'll suit each other well; for now, thy vapors to dispel. I come, a squire of high degree, in scarlet coat, with golden trimming. This life of earth, whatever my attire, would pain me in its wonted fashion. Too old am I to play with passion... Too young, to be without desire. Upon the verge of bitter weeping. To see the day of disappointment break. To no one hope of mine - not one - its promise keeping. What from the world have I to gain? So, by the burden of my days oppressed - Death is desired - and Life a thing unblest! And yet is never Death a wholly welcome guest. Come here! Such is the everlasting song - that in the ears of all men rings - that unrelieved, our whole life long. Come here! Jorma, that's her car. That asshole! I lost 35% today because of her. Then, too, when night descends - there, also, comes no rest to me. She deserved that. Woe, woe! Thou hast it destroyed, the beautiful world, with powerful fist. Okay. I'll go that way. 35%... Damn tree huggers. There. Nailed it. Alright, goddammit... Fucking hell... I'll be back. Mensch... Everything is fine, Atman. Calm down, Atman. It's a moose. Fuck. Fuck! Dear customers, the store is closing in five minutes. Please proceed to the cash registers. Welcome back! Yes, yes. Ma'am! Help. Look, mum! Your jigsaw puzzles. What is it? I had a nightmare. There were these rocks that were falling. Rocks that were falling? That doesn't sound like a nightmare. It was like in that accident. Oh, that one. It's time to go to the celebration. Dad! -Aarre! I got a gift for you! Hey! Fuck! No! Marja! Subtitles: BTI Studios
