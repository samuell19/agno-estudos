Yukiya! -Yukiya! -Ryo! You can't help him, Ryo! Alexanders can't travel over water! Let go of me! I can't let Yukiya... Is that... Akito and Leila? Ryo! Ayano! Do you read me? Yukiya's in there? I've picked up the beacon from Yukiya's Alexander. Akito, you have to save Yukiya! I won't let him die this easily! What's the matter, Leila? What's happening? Was that thing that crashed in the lake a float system's Sakuradite reactor? Yukiya is still inside! Yukiya is in there?! Anna, think! How can we save Yukiya ?! Leila, Alexanders are equipped with emergency shock-absorbing balloons. If you access his Alexander's system and trigger them, the cockpit block will be enveloped by balloons, and their buoyancy should bring it to the surface! But how do we access Yukiya's Alexander? If Akito uses his BBS, it will link his and Yukiya's Alexanders. Akito, did you get that? Activating BBS and taking control of Yukiya's systems. It surfaced! Lt. Col. Warwick! It's Yukiya! Take us closer! Roger that! That chick is your CO? Don't call her "that chick". She's got a name: Leila Malcal. So that's Leila, huh? Hey, Akito... Don't talk. I'm going to save you, no matter what. Is that passion I hear? That's not really your style, Akito. Yeah, it's not. Anna, we've successfully retrieved Yukiya. He's badly injured, though. Get ward to Dr. Handle at once. - Yukiya's hurt? - Cpt. Clement, what's the matter? Cpt. Clement! The wZERO Unit and the commander's party are returning via the tunnels. Inform Dr. Handle! I know. I'm forwarding her their location data. Transport the wounded to the garrison! Do a head count of all squads' Knightmares! Abandon any irreparable ones where they're standing! Sir Brandello! My squad has fewer than ten Knightmares left. We should count ourselves lucky that' you are safe, Dare. Over half of your squad appears to be undamaged, Sir Schultz. Yes, we were fortunate to have been at the rear of the formation. What are you doing?! Grand Master Shaing has not sounded the retreat! Two-thirds of our forces are destroyed! We require time to regroup! Has the enemy's sneak attack struck tear into you? No knight would force his troops into a fight devoid of honor! But upstarts like you would know nothing of such things! Jean. Lord Hyuga? I was listening. Have the Three Swordmasters pull back for now. Are you sure, sir? I shall test their mettle as knights to the fullest soon enough. I will kill them. I will kill everything. Suzaku... Give me water... Could you give me some water? Please? Suzaku... Kill me, Suzaku... Suzaku... Please, Suzaku? Let's go get her. Together. Let's go fetch Nunnally. 150 kilometers east of Warsaw Eastern Front We've received reports that Lord Shaing has seized power in Euro Britannia! Lord Shaing is an Eleven, as I recall. Reports say as much, sir! The Elevens are a race that mustn't be underestimated. I told him to jump ship right away, damn it! You're always dawdling! Yukiya, you dummy... The bleeding from the pancreatic artery is had, but I think I can fix it. I just hope this channel holds out that long. I've never performed telesurgery on a patient in a secret location before. I'm just doing this as a favor to you, Sophie. I appreciate it, David. Then give me your word, Sophie. - Promise you what? - That when Takeru wakes up, I'll be the first person you call. I don't know where you are right now, but you're with Takeru, right? Thank you, David. You have my ward. I'll hold you to that. I have more losses than wins against Takeru in chess. I want a chance to break even. Tell him to wake his ass up, Sophie. I don't care if it takes a miracle. I'm told that Yukiya's surgery was a success. Two-thirds of the enemy's forces are dead thanks to Yukiya, but they still have overwhelming numerical superiority. I'll have Major Hammel's security team pilot Alexanders as well. Well, Hammel's team is really just support... The latest data just came in from Cpt. Clement. What about the Drones? Sounds like we'll have ten, max. The parts were used in Hammel's Alexanders. What about the Alexander that I piloted once? Maj. Hammel will use it. I see... Don't you have a Knightmare for me to pilot? You'll be way tougher with me on your side. We're facing the Holy Order of Michael. That's your former unit. Lord Shaing tried to kill me! Plus, I owe Akito one. Pops! I'm gonna grab these! Learn some manners... Ashley, I'll entrust an Alexander to you. I also think that's a fine idea, Commander. Leila, you're a smart girl! This Knightmare data we got from that red-haired boy has certainly been useful, hasn't it, Sgt. Hilda? His name is "Ashley", Sgt. Chloe. We wouldn't be using Schr√∂tter Steel if it weren't for Ashley. It was rough on the boss to make all the design alterations, though. Yeah, she had to revise two whole designs: the new Alexander model, and Akito's upgraded model. The boss sure is amazing. Yes, even though military-use robotics are beneath her. The elbow motor is fried! Do we have any spares? Not in stock! Grab one from one of the scrap units! There's not much we can do without fresh supplies. There's no choice. We have to make do with what we've got. Lord Hyuga... Hey. Ashley! What are you doing in that uniform?! I have something to say to you. To me? You and I are two of a kind. Our parents abandoned us as kids, and just when we were at death's door, we were taken in by Lord Shaing. - So we both owe him our-- - He's changed. I don't know how or why, but it's like he's possessed. By Death. But a buddy of mine says he wants to save Lord Shaing all the same. 'Cause they're brothers. Akito Hyuga... Jean... You said you went by Jeanne when he found you, right? Jeanne, I think we should help him out. The only person who can save Shin Hyuga from the darkness is Akito. Very well, let us begin. All forces, begin advance! We'll show him the honor of Michael! Right! Dore, I'm going in first!! Good hunting, Sir Schultz! It's no use! It can't punch through! Have the Canterbury move up to shorten the range! Advance! - Don't you have visuals yet?! - I'm working on it! Got it! 8 o'clock! Range, 250! Commencing counterattack! Taking fire from enemy wall! Close the distance! Don't back off! Protect the Canterbury's legs! Alpha Platoon, move up! Don't fall back! Hang in there! We 'II fallback temporarily! Lord Shaing... Retreat will not be tolerated. I'll shoot you if you fall back. Wh-Why you... Would you kindly show me this "knight's honor" of yours, Sir Brondello? Crack in sector A23! - Good, we're latched on! - Let's move! Knightmares climbing in through sector A17! Eliminate them. It's no use! We can't advance any further! We've last contact with Alpha Platoon! We might be out of men by the time we finally storm the castle... Dore! My squad will make an opening! The rest will be up to you. Understood. Wait for me with Lord Manfredi. I'm looking forward to being reunited with you on the other side. Farewell! - Explosion detected, sector A23! - Defensive wall crumbling! Disposable pawns are the ideal role for fools. Will now mount a charge into the enemy castle! There it is! Going in! Knightmare squad has made it through the old gate and has entered the castle! Make for the enemy command center! - Path is blocked! - Rescue the wounded! Getting to them won't be so simple, eh? wZERO Squad, stand by to counterattack. Cpt. Hyuga, stand by to launch! Do you copy? Cpt. Hyuga! I think this baby's gonna be perfect for me. - Why the hell do you get the new one?! - Quit your bitching. Come again ?! There they are! Open fire! - The enemy! Scatter! - Up top! They're above us! Fall back! All units, scatter! It's an ambush! I'm Ashley Ashra! If anybody wants to try themselves against me, come on out! It's the Ghost of Hannibal! The Ashra Force's Ashley, eh? We'll make a concentrated push! - Here they come! - This will be fun! He's here. One enemy Knightmare approaching at high speed! - Do you have a visual? - Just a moment! Got it! It's the four-legged Knightmare! All forces, advance into the castle. We'll take the command center. Lord Shaing! Just when I thought you couldn't get any more cowardly! Is that you, Ashley? You begged and were given a Europian Knightmare, I see. Bastard! This is bad, Akito! He got past us! Lord Shaing! I'll kill you, too. Wait in the nether world for your comrades to join you. It will be my parting gift to you! You son of a bitch! Ashley! You're too close! Brother! What point is there to fighting?! The destruction of this world is my goal, Akito. Die, Akito! Destroy the world... and die! Wha...? Fighting still underway in sector 23! Akito, Ryo, and Ashley's frames are all running at full power... They're on the verge of overloading! Commander. I have a favor to ask. Would you mind keeping this? Akito? If I die in this battle and there 's nothing left, bury this. You make certain... ...that you came back. I... There's more that I want to talk to you about, Akito. So please... Promise me that you'll return here with everyone. Another Order of Michael Knightmare squad is coming in through the old gate! Commence defensive operation #4. Here they come! Akito! - Son of a... - Ashley. We're falling back to sector 18. All right, fine! Have arrived at middle gate! Platoon now entering! The enemy counterattack has ceased? Oh, no! Four! Three! Two! One! A-Ayano... Ayano... Yukiya! Where am I? Yukiya! Thank goodness, Yukiya! - Ow! - S-Sorry! I... How long have I been out? Six days. Today's the seventh. Oh. It's been seven days? Is everyone... Oh, no! What are you doing? You can't get out of bed yet! I have to... I have to tell Leila right away! Mariko and Shinji told me. We're the only ones who can protect the world! Explosion confirmed in sector 23! Elimination of enemy Knightmare squad successful! Enemy Knightmare squad on sector 4 castle wall! Change ammunition type to cluster warhead. - Loading complete! - Locked on to target! Fall back! Hurry! Impacts in and around sector 25! Enemy artillery fire! Leila, do you copy? - Ayano? - Have my and Yukiya's Alexanders repped. What's the matter? Is Yukiya all right? I'm fine... Leila, I finally figured it out... That hating the world doesn't do any good. If it's to help my friends, I can love the world. - They're here! - Stay calm! We'll hold this position to the last man! Enemy forces have entered sector 13! They're climbing over the northwestern wall! We're only after the enemy commander! Firing MPA cannon! Target that cannon with launchers! Enemy troops are massing at the control tower! - Olivia. - I know. We're the only ones who know how to use these. I just hope we don't have to use them. Lord Hyuga, we just finished rewriting the transport's flight program at the launch site. As soon as it's prepped, launch it. Jean. We'll soon bring destruction down upon everything. Lord Hyuga... Freeze! Make one move, and I'll fire on your cockpit! Resistance is useless. Step out of your Knightmare at once! That's... So, you must be the "lady knight" that Ashley told us about. Ashley told us everything. Shut your mouth and lie on the floor. Do you really think it's okay to bomb Pendragon and destroy the world? I said to get on the floor! I know what it's like to want to do whatever the person you love says. But you have to do more than that. Stay back! If you really want to do what's best for that person... Stop! ...you can't just do what they-- They'll never know how you feel that way. My feelings are irrelevant. Lord Hyuga's wishes... Lord Hyuga's desires! I want to make them come true! Even if you give him everything he wants, he still won't be happy. What should I... What should I do? Die... Signal from ultra-high altitude observation balloon has cut out! Remain calm! We can still compute enemy positions with just sensors! Yes, ma'am! Stop it! Fools should die! No! - We're too close! Get some distance! - You're wrong... Lt. Naruse? With big enemies, you have to get in close and get into their blind spot! - He's coming at us! - Shoot! Shoot him! - He's in our blind spot! - Target him with antipersonnel cannon! - Die, Akito! - I won't! - It's no use! Take evasive! - Bye, bye. Yukiya! Bastards, we're not letting you get any closer! They're swarming at us like bugs! I'm gonna squash 'em! Akito! I'm getting a spike in Akito's brainwaves! - The BRS is entering an entangle phase? - It's a wave resonance! Sayama and Ashley are both completely synchronized with Cpt. Hyuga! BBS operation rate? It's over 300%! Akito! Akito's vanished?! "Where am I?" Young Master, congratulations. You have a little brother. Shin, this is your little brother. Come and introduce yourself. My... little brother? - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! - Congratulations! "In that instant, I knew." "I knew who Akito's real father was." Sara! What are the coordinates of Akito and the enemy Knightmare?! I lost them! All of a sudden... their signals vanished! Why did this have to happen now?! The brainwave resonance is affecting spacetime... Is this... a singularity?! You should kill me, as well. If I die, I can be free from you. How foolish... Your betrayal amounts to nothing in the guiding principles of this world. I shall forgive you. Remaining at my side until your death will be your punishment for your sin. How can you be so... "How disgusting." "I feel nothing but despair over being born from this woman's womb." "But..." "...she is still our mother." It's fused with Akito's waveform? No, it looks like they're resonating. Joe Wise! Are you sure this isn't a telemetry malfunction? Yes! I'm not seeing any program errors! - The BRS values indicate an anomaly! - There's noise! The coordinates of all Alexanders are too jumbled to get a fix on their location! Impossible, a Penrose effect? Show me the correlation between the brainwaves and spacetime parameters! You want a comparison display of mental and physical phenomena? Yes. The brainwave anomaly is clearly causing the coordinate scrambling. Are you saying that the human mind... the subconscious... is affecting the physical world? Probably. The world only becomes fixed through the act of an observer observing it. By using the BBS system to entangle the brains of multiple people, we're creating an observer more powerful than any other. Our universe is formed by the brains of intelligent beings observing events, and those brains are created by the universe. When you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. That transcends time and space and makes it possible to alter the past, or even to create a new universe. A new universe? Let's move! Intruders are breaching final defensive perimeter! Oh, no! Do you want power? If that is your desire... Yes... If you give me power, I'll destroy the world. I shall bestow my power upon all those who hate this world. I am worthy of using that power! But this power will isolate you! I'm not afraid of being alone. In fact, I welcome it. They're in the corridors! All personnel, take shelter in the command post! - Chloe! - Hilda, I'm scared! Chloe! Hilda! Don't shoot! We're-- Commander! Hold your fire! Stop shooting! How did it come to this? Lt. Col. Warwick... Anna? Dr. Handle? Lt. Col. Warwick? Everyone... - "Where am I?" - Hello, Mademoiselle. What seems to be the trouble? Are you looking for something? Bradow, this woman is a soldier. It's rude to call her 'Mademoiselle'. Oh, of course. - I've never seen that uniform before, - "Father and Mother?" but it's very fetching. - Akito! - Akito! - Akito! - Akito! Boy, you have potential. In Britannia, even if you are Japanese, if you hone your fighting skills, you can become a knight. Look, Mother! Isn't it a lovely boat? Alice. I think that's enough. Your hands are ice cold already. Brother... They're all... The balance between intellect and instinct is terrible in humans. Don 't you agree, Leila ? Who are you? I am no one. To humans, I am someone who does not exist. But I exist to those who can see me. Just like the witch in the forest... She's a human being. Just like you. Maybe it would be easier for you to think of me. .. no, of "us" as a collective consciousness. Or a being who influences the evolution of the universe. Are you saying that you determine our fates? Not at all. You sought out power and gained it. But that power is a bit different. I only want everyone to be happy. At the root of the desires of all lifeforms is the desire to continue to exist. Eventually, they all will go extinct and vanish from this spacetime, though. But right now, we're alive and exist here. True. There is a beauty to be found in your ephemeral nature. Your power is a fragment of the Geass. A fragment? The Geass might have been too much for humans. I think that we should retrieve it from this world. The Geass? I once thought that humans weren't very impressive as lifeforms went. So you had neither the ability nor the right to use the Geass. That you would be better off extinct. Please, wait! But this might be an opportunity for you to prove me wrong. Assuming you are able to stop that man with his perverted Geass, that is. Explosion detected at base of control tower! - Chloe! Liberte status? - Still no signal!! Joe Wise! Record this! Yes, ma'am! Already recording! - Hilda, what's this? - Ashley's out of control! Doctor! I'm sending you the brainwave measurement data! Intruders are breaching final defensive perimeter! - Inject bulkheads with anti-explosion gel! - Roger! Sir Brondello, we can't destroy this door! A blast-proof hatch, eh? Enemy forces are in the corridor! Commander, shall I use gas to wipe them out? Wait! I'll talk with the commander outside. Open a channel. Brother, remember! Damn you! We desire a cease-fire. We have no wish for further fighting. A woman? I am this base's commanding officer, Leila Breisgau. Commander. I know a wonderful painting. There was an angel and woman... It had a woman who looked a lot like you in it. This is the painting. I think it was hanging in the house I was born in. Did you like this painting? I'm not sure. But I do love the kind expression on this woman's face. "Akito... " Commander? Lt. Col. Warwick, we're scuttling the command center. It's hard to believe this is the same Akito. Brother! I won't give you an easy death! Ryo! I won't let you kill my teammate! You're just as tough as I hoped you'd be! Ashley, I'll start with you! Stop it! Akito! Crap, this thing is stuck! Akito! - Akito! - Akito! Akito! Mother... Mother... Farewell, Mother. Now you won't have to suffer anymore. Big brother... Brother... Why are you alive ? This world is mad. The thought of an innocent like you suffering in this mad world, Akito... It's too much to hear. Akito, die. Brother, this has to stop. Slaughtering each other won't solve anything. You're right, it won't solve anything. But that's what people want. So do you, Akito. You enjoy fighting. You're wrong! So die, Akito! Vanish from this world! Akito! I'll kill you, Akito! Death is a blessing! All humans will die! - Stop it! - Stop it! Stop it! Filthy spirits! You, who love your younger brother so, wish to release your loved ones from the curse of this world. Your desire... Your kindhearted desire is clear. But perhaps you are mistaken. There is no mistake! We know because you loved us. But you might be wrong. This world might contain more possibilities than you think. That woman... ...believes that to be true. There is no hope in this world! Please don't kill Akita. Akito means that much to you? You didn't kill Akito back then, either! I loved you just as much. Liar! No, Brother! That's exactly why-- Akito! That's exactly why it's your destiny to die at my hand. I won't let you kill Akito! I won't let you kill Akito! Akito, live! Akito! Stop... - Don't kill Akito! - Don't kill Akito... - I won't let you kill Akito! - I won't let you kill Akito... - Stop! - Don't kill Akito! - Don't kill Akito! - I won't let you kill Akito! Enough of this! Please don't suffer any more than you already have. Jean, what could you know about it? I... I love you... Stupid woman. You are just like my mother. Foolish. Brother! Don't touch me! Brother! Brother! Big brother? Big brother! Stay away! Big brother, let's go home. Leave me alone! Don 't cry. Don 't cry! Climb on, Akita. - Big brother... - Big boys don't cry. Big brother, I lave you. Akito... Brother... Brother? Brother! Let go. You're not alone anymore. Go on living... ...in this world. Brother? Jean.Jeanne. Shin... Jeanne... Shin! I've missed you! I'm sorry. From now on, we'll he together forever, Jeanne. I'm glad, Shin... Akito...
