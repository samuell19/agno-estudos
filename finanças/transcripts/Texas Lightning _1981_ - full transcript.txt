Come on, Buddy, come on. - [Woman] I heard you cry out in the middle of the night. You don't remember me talkin' to you, do you? - [Karl] Oh, you know me, I don't remember nothin'. - [Woman] I think you're in pain. Maybe you're in pain and you won't admit it to yourself. - The only pain I got is listenin' to you, I'll tell ya. - Please don't take the boy, he's different. - You've sissified him. You molly-coddled him. You've made him a momma's boy and the laugh of the neighborhood. He's gonna become a man. He is comin' huntin' with me and the boys! - Donna! I want some breakfast! - Aw shit. - Oh boy, oh boy, everything is no, no, no. She's cuckoo, she's cuckoo. - Buddy Owen. - [Buddy] Morning, Mom. - Don't go if you don't wanna. - He says I have to. It means a lot to him. - He doesn't understand, he never did. You just can't let people push you. They think you're easy, they push you. Don't let 'em, honey. - I don't think it's like that. - Of course you don't. You're young and you don't know that. They know. Don't let him get you. - Mom, nothing's gonna happen. - You don't know that, Buddy. - I can take care of myself, Mother. - Of course you can. Mother loves you, Buddy Owen. You love Mother? - Yeah. - [Woman] Tell me. - I love you, Mom. We'll be back before you know it. - Buddy? Careful, Buddy Owen. - Buddy Owen, your eggs is gettin' cold! - Did your mother teach you to cook? - I ain't got no mother, Frank. - Is she dead? - Yeah, but nobody's told her. - It's a little too much pepper. - It was an accident. You know accidents do happen. You always have to leave room for human error. It's a fact of life. - And who taught you the facts of life? - Why, you did, Frank. Real good. You were a good teacher. - What are you gonna do while I'm away? - Well I'm gonna read me some books and I'm gonna smarten myself up. - Good, start with a cookbook, will you? - I don't know why you wanna go off shootin' a gun when you got me here. It's like goin' with them guys is so important. - Well it is, we always go. - It just doesn't seem like there's any fun in it. - Well who said anything about fun? - Well then why do you go? - Because I want to. - You want to or you have to? - I have to and I want to. Now get my bags, will ya? - It's not so bad. - Morning, Dad. - She's nuts. Sit down and eat your breakfast. There's some toast. She's worse. I don't wanna put her away.

I'll take care of your mom. - Dad? - Hm? - Do I have to go? - What'd you say? It's the last damn time! The last you ask me that question. You're goin'! You're damn right you're goin. You ain't a goddamn pansy. You ain't a goddamn baby. You are a goddamn man, and I am gonna prove it today. You are regular. You are not different! Buddy Owen, When I was your age, I skinned 40 dear. 40! How many did you skin? - Yes, sir. May I see the paper? - Gimme the sports page. (twangy country music) - I'm really gonna miss you. (horn honking) - [Slingshot] I read you, copy. This is Slingshot, over. - Breaker, breaker, one eight. This is Gunpowder. Your guy Copy come back? - Be careful. I'll be waitin' up for you. - You be good. - Fix you a sandwich and some coffee, and I'll even build a fire. Bye. - [Frank] Come on, Karl, get that hiney in gear! Let's go, let's go! (horn honking) - That's them, hey! What I need you to do, Buddy. Go get your things, get the dog. Go, move it. I'll get my pistol. - Hey, Karl! (whistling) - Come on, Tao. Come on, baby. Come on, here we go. - In fact, let me tell you this trip is gonna do wonders for the boy. I know you don't understand about things like this, but it's gonna do wonders for him. - Hey, Karl! - I hope he ain't bringin' that damn kid. - Probably bringin' that dog. That ain't no huntin' dog, that's an egg sucker. We shoot those where I come from. - Kids, dogs, he's probably bringing his old lady as well. - Why not? Just put the wheelchair in the back and strap her down with bungee cords. (laughing) (laughing) - Hey, hey! (horn honking) - [Buddy] Come on, Tao. Come on, baby. - Hey, Frank. Hey, Leonard.

Every time I tell 'em how much it is for the tow, they just wanna sit up there and wait. - Leave 'em up there. (laughing) - You boys ain't goin' huntin', are ya? - Hell yes we're goin huntin'! - Amen. - You suckers are gonna die out there. - Yeah, well heat or no heat, we're goin' huntin'. - Why don't you go into the mountains where it's cooler? Get yourself a few deer or somethin'. What's so important about some dumb rabbits? - Rabbits is faster than deer, Walt. Let me tell you about rabbits. The rabbit hunt is very special. You gotta crouch low, you do a special kind of sight. Let me tell you something, rabbits ain't dumb. I mean, they're fast and they ain't dumb like him. - I'll skin their ass before you know. (laughing) - Well here's another big sale. You know, Buddy, that dog's gonna be mighty miserable out there. - You think so, Walt? - By the time you get back, he's gonna look like a hamster. That's a nice lookin' scooter you got there man. - Thanks. - I'll be over there. - Alright. - Them bikers is a dyin' breed, Karl. Ain't like when I used to ride, know what I mean? - Well I didn't care for that particularly either. - How's she look, huh? - Well she looks good. - By Monday mornin' she'll be good as new. - Hey, Leonard, you heard any good police calls lately? (radio squawking) - Well I been thinkin' about formin' my own force. Cops these days are nothin' but a bunch of goddamn kids. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - Yeah, nice paint, high-grade stuff there. Missed that right there. - Let me get that. - Get that dirty rag off my baby. Hey, what you doin', Walt? Hey. - Just tryin' to be good. - Oh, please, come on. - Think it's a good idea to take the kid huntin'? - Well why the hell not? - I don't know, he just looks like he's dressed for Sunday school, you know? - Let me tell you somethin', Walt. You know, sometimes you'll be shit yourself. You're gonna be talkin' about the dog in a minute. - You know damn well that dog ain't no huntin' dog. - You tryin' to tell me they're a couple of misfits? (radio chattering) - You understand that? - Yeah. - Beer, gimme beer. Hey Walt, go in and pay for the gas. What do you think of these two rookies here, huh? - I don't think Buddy Owen ever been huntin' before. - 30. That true? Buddy Owen, you ever been rabbit huntin' before? - I've never hunted anything. - Well, you got a gun? - My dad has one for me. I don't know anything about guns. - Well we'll teach you. - You never even killed a snake? - No. - Well boy, you've got an education comin'. (gunshot banging) (gunshot banging) - [Leonard] Hey, Buddy Owen, give me a Pepsi, will ya? - [Buddy] Sure. Hey! - Never point a gun at anybody like that. - Sorry, Leonard. - Gimme that. - Gimme a beer! - Jesus Christ. - God, it's gotta be 120 out here. Maybe we are crazy. - Are you dumb? - Ah, Jesus that's cold. - Hey Karl, you gotta teach your kid how to hold a gun. - Yep, absolutely right, Leonard. Buddy Owen, you never, never point a gun at anybody unless you intend to use it. - Maybe he did. (laughing) - That's not funny. - I think it's funny. - Yeah, it's funny. - It was an accident. My rifle just pointed that way when I went to get Leonard a Pepsi. - It's not a rifle. It's a shotgun. Small 12-gauge. - Best thing for shootin' rabbits, Buddy Owen. - And lizards. - What do you do with them after you shoot them? - Nothin'. It ain't the idea of killin', it's just the idea of standin' there, cockin' that thing, takin' aim and then hittin' what you're aimin' at. - Yeah, you could shoot at a piece of paper if you want. - A tin can or anything. - After you shoot a rabbit, you know, you gotta step on its head. You see, you gotta separate the head from the body. I know it sounds bad, but it's done for a purpose, you see. You gotta drain the blood out of the rabbit. Otherwise when you're cleanin' it, it's a bloody mess. - It's already drained. - Now most people use a shotgun here like Leonard's. - Look, when you wanna get good with a rifle and a scope, you sit on a mountaintop for a couple of days with a box of shells. - And a roll of toilet paper. (laughing) - And you shoot jacks. Now this ain't done for sport, but to improve your eye. - What for? - Target practice, boy, target practice. (gunshot banging) Tin cans and paper are stationary targets. Jackrabbits move. (gunshot banging) - Be careful! - I can tell you're just thrilled about the idea of shootin' jacks for sport. (gunshot banging) - I don't understand it. - A lot of people don't, but jackrabbits multiply so fast they're all over the desert. Somebody's gotta kill 'em. (gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) (gunshots banging) (gunshot banging) (birds chirping) (gunshots banging) - Buddy Owen, see that little brown squirrel there? - Where? - There, see him? (gunshot banging) It's gonna be alright. Let's take a stroll up here. - Come on, Tao. - [Karl] Ain't this somethin,' boy? - [Buddy] Yes, it's beautiful. Did you see that canyon back there? Clouds in the sky. - [Karl] Yeah, well that too, but I meant the boys. Ain't they somethin'? I mean, this is fun. - [Buddy] Yes, Dad.

You gotta take the good with the bad, you know what I mean? - Yeah. - We're all a little dumb, aren't we? - Yeah. - I mean catch Einstein there. - [Karl] Drivin' in a car with him. - Yeah, but women are more dumber. - More dumber. - Romantic son of a bitch, ain't he? - Yeah. - Just a realist, Frank.

(sirens blaring) - [Leonard] Jesus, he's a nigger. - May I see your driver's license please? - Leonard here's an honorary deputy, buckaroo. - Fine, may I see your driver's license please? - Get your hand out. - [Officer] You boys were goin' kinda fast. - Who you callin' boy? - Sorry, sir, but the speed limits are posted everywhere at 55 miles an hour. You were doing nearly 70. - In a cat's ass. - Nearly 70. Now will you take your license out of the wallet please? - Good picture of him, don't you think? - This vehicle registered to you? - Yeah. - I'm not gonna cite you, this is just a warning. I'll be back in a moment. - How in the hell in the middle of nowhere? I mean, nowhere, no place to hide. There ain't nothin'. We get a crumb bum, no neck, blue gum, boogie-faced spade cop. - Karl, if your kid wasn't here, I'd get that sucker. There's no witnesses. - Do it, go on, I dare you. Go on, do it. - No, I'm not gonna do it. I just wanna do it. - Bullshit. (police radio chattering) - [Buddy] What's going on? - Oh, cops got a report of a kid beatin' his meat in the back of a pickup truck. (laughing) He thinks it's you. We gave him your mom's home phone though. He's radioing in on you now. - Keep your hands off of that dog, you hear? (laughing) - Thank you. Here's your license. Try to keep your speed down. Sign here please. - [Karl] Make your X, Leonard. - Well, when you pick that up, you'll find your warning has turned into a ticket, and you have 15 days to get it taken care of or it will go to warrant. - Okay. - Okay.

And for what it's worth, she wouldn't give a damn anyway. - I'm thirstier than I thought I was. - The band's pretty good. - Hey, Buddy boy. Listen, most guys think the kinda chick to pick up on are the real cute ones. That ain't it. - Well what is? - Ugly ones. If they're fat, that's even better. If they're both ugly and fat they're so damn grateful. - They are? - Sure, wouldn't shit ya. Listen, say you got three chicks, you know, and they're all together. They're friends, you know. You pick the ugliest, the one that knows she ain't gonna get asked. You got it made, she's all yours. That's psychology, boy. - [Buddy] It's that simple? - That's a fact, boy. - That is a fact.

No, I make 'em as strong as I can. - They get into ridin' me and they don't let up. - I guarantee you, boy, that they forgot it already. - Hey, there's a hair in my drink. - Well if it's kinky, leave it there. If it's straight, throw it on the rug. (laughing) - It's kinky. - Jesus, Buddy boy, everybody goes through this. I mean, when I was your age, what I went through you would not believe. - Why do people have to hurt people? - You serious? Let me tell you somethin', Buddy Owen.

I'm surrounded by a staghorn cholla and a crucifixion thorn here in the middle of the desert. - Why don't you come with me? - Shh. - I hear all sorts of noises. Sounds like you got a girl there. - No, Hon, just some crazy drunks. We stopped at a bar in the middle of the thing. What's goin' on, baby, you miss me? - I miss you more than you can imagine. Missin' you just makes me shiver all over. - Oh, I'm cheery just hearin' you talk about that. - Franker, are you comin' home tonight? - Tomorrow, or the day after.

I'm not goin' out on you. - Who's that? - That's his wife. - [Frank] Oh hello, Precious. - Honey, this isn't what it looks like now. Now you got the wrong idea. - Oh shut up. - Damn, damn Loretta. Why do you always have to go and hit me for? Goddamn, Loretta, you gotta hit me? (screaming) - Just a second, Mister, I think you forgot your manners. - Okay, buddy, it's only my wife. - Listen, you cheated on me for the last time. - [Roy] Honey, calm down. - Now you're really finished. - Just calm down, will you? - We was just talkin'. - Yeah, honey, that's all. Now just calm down now, Loretta. Now will you please just calm down? Damn it, just calm down will you? - That's okay. Hello. Come on here, Sweetheart. Oh yeah, yeehaw! Oh, hang on. Woo, yeehaw! Comin' through. Comin' through, woo! Yeehaw! - Hey, baby, what time do you get out of this joint? You get me hot all over. - Well now maybe I can cool part of you off. (laughing) - [Frank] Gitty up! Yeehaw! Yahoo! - Alright, everybody, that's just about gonna do it for the Stone Country Band tonight. We'd like to thank you for comin' down. We hope you had a good time. Don't forget now, we're gonna be here every night except Monday and Tuesday. Till then, this is Tim Johnson speakin' for the Stone Country Band sayin' ya'll come back now, hear? (laughing) ♫ 43 bottles of beer ♫ 43 bottles ♫ We gotta put the bottles - Good night, Fay. - Night. - Buddy Owen, I think that little cooze likes you. - What you waitin' for? - [Karl] I'm gonna check out Madeline Bow-Legs. - [Frank] Well don't get any on ya, Karl. Don't eat her meat loaf. (laughing) - Hey! What me to set it up for you, boy? - No. I'd do it myself if I wanted to. - Let's take the kid to a cathouse, come on. - You can't pound the pud all your life, boy. - I don't pound the pud. - Oh, bullpucky! - Your face wouldn't be breakin' out if you was gettin' it straight. - Is that how you lost your teeth? - Yeah. (laughing) - I think that one guy is, I don't know. I don't know, seems kinda out of place, you know? - Geez, Sweetheart. (shouting drunkenly) - Hey how 'bout watchin' where you're goin there, Sweetcakes? - Jefferson. - Karl. - [Karl] Krebsbach, right. - What are you doin', Karl? - Well, Jefferson. Gimme the glasses. Just step over here. I wanna see which one's the moose. (laughing) Wanna tell you a little story about every single fight from L.A. to Tokyo. Good night, Sweet Prince, last drink's on me. - [Frank] We still got enough time to pick up a couple of jelly rolls. - Hey, Buddy Owen, you wantin' a ride? - [Frank] Buddy Owen, go to it, kid. - Sure. - Come on. Get in there slut magnet. Get in there. - [Buddy] See you guys back at the motel. - He ain't gonna be able to shoot anything tomorrow, but he's gonna knock off one hell of a piece. - I wouldn't mind chompin' down on that myself. - With what? (laughing) - Well I don't now about you boys. I'm gettin' awful hungry. - Me too. - Yeah. - Well good night, Jefferson Krebsbach. - That's my dog. - Hey. - Tao. - Hi, Tao. This is a cute little place. - Oh, thanks. Tao, you stay out there. - Hey, could you turn that light out? - Sure. - [Fay] And close the door. - [Buddy] Sure. - [Fay] That's better. - I can't offer you anything to drink or anything like that. - [Fay] Oh, that's okay. I ain't thirsty. I'm just gonna smoke a cigarette if that's alright with you. - Sure, but it's not good for you. - Who knows what's good? - That's true. - Hey, where the other guys stayin'? - Oh, they got a room just across the way. It's a big room with a kitchenette. This room's just got one bed in it. - I can see that. You know, you're bein' put off by yourself. Bein' discriminated against. - Not really, I'm just younger than them guys. - [Fay] And a lot smarter too, if you ask me, Buddy Owen. - Thanks, Fay. - Buddy Owen, I'd like to stay here tonight with you if you don't care. - No, I don't care. I mean, yeah, sure. - See my sister's in the hospital havin' this operation, and I would just hate to be in that apartment by myself all alone. - Well what's she havin' an operation about? - Oh, she's real sick. It's takin' every penny I make and all my tips to pay for this operation. Doctors are real expensive, and we're real bad off. - Don't you have any insurance? - We ain't got no money for insurance, it costs a lot. And besides, you know, who thinks you're gonna need an operation when you're young? - Yeah, that's true. - Buddy Owen, I hate to ask you this, but I need about another 50 bucks to pay the doctors, and I was wonderin' if you could give it to me. - Well, yeah, sure. I've got $22 here, I'll send you the rest. - 20's fine. Thanks, Buddy. I wouldn't ask you unless it was somethin' real important like this operation. - Well I understand. - [Fay] Thank you. - [Buddy] What's that? - [Fay] Probably just the police. - Police? You better get out of here. - Why, I ain't done nothin'. - Well, you're not registered. - That ain't nothin'. Ain't you ever stayed in motels before? - Well sure. - It's probably just some drunk beatin' up on his wife. - Yeah, you get a lot of that nowadays. - Y'all got a mom and dad? - Karl's my dad, the older guy I'm with. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - You don't seem much like his son. - He's my dad. - Will you kiss me? - [Frank] Gimme a patty melt with milk. - [Karl] What do you want? - [Leonard] Couple of eggs, coffee. - [Karl] How you want 'em? Well tell the lady how you want 'em. - Doesn't matter. - Scrambled eggs and coffee. - [Leonard] Yeah, yeah I want three, three eggs. - [Frank] Oh God, where are they now? - [Karl] What'd we wind up with? - [Frank] What do you mean? - [Karl] Each other, Jesus Christ. - [Leonard] Get your hand off my knee. (laughing) - [Frank] That's Fay's car there, ain't it? - [Leonard] Sure is. - [Karl] A chip off the old block, guys. Kid got lucky. (laughing) (laughing) - [Leonard] Hey, buddy Owen. It's just me, Leonard. - Get out of here. - [Fay] Tell them to get out of here. - [Leonard] It's Leonard, Frank, and your dad. - Will you guys get out of here? - What you doin'? Is Fay in there with you, or can't she talk with her mouth full? (laughing) - Just bringin' you a little nightcap. Hey, boy, have a drink. - [Buddy] I don't want any of that. - [Frank] Oh, we don't give a good crap what you want. We're bein' hospitable now. Come on. (shouting) - [Fay] Get 'em, Buddy Owen! - Forget about the boy. - Buddy Owen! - [Frank] I'm talkin' about the girl. Get him off me. It's our turn now. - No, it ain't. Asshole, get the hell out of here! (shouting) - [Karl] It's alright, boy. It'll be alright. - Buddy Owen! - It's alright. - [Fay] Buddy Owen! Buddy Owen! - It's alright. (shouting) - [Leonard] Knock it off. - [Karl] You alright? It'll be alright, Buddy. - [Fay] Let me go, damn it! - Get her, Frank! - Buddy Owen! Buddy Owen! (screaming) (laughing) (laughing) - Bitch, she stole my wallet. - I'm glad she did. - Two bit whores, boy. Someday you'll thank me for pointin' that out to you. - They're all whores. They're all goddamn whores. - [Karl] She ask you for anything? - Yeah, I thought it was for something else. - [Karl] For what? - Her sister. - For gettin' laid, that's what you paid for, boy. A man don't give back, he takes it. - Is that a fact? Is that what a man does? - [Leonard] She didn't put up too much of a fight, just scratched a little. - Boys, I think Buddy Owen and all of us should get some shut eye. We got some huntin' to do tomorrow, serious huntin'. You alright, Buddy Owen? Son. Please. (coughing) - [Frank] I had over a hundred bucks in that wallet, my license, my credit cards, every goddamn thing. - Hey, Frank, gimme a cigarette, will you? - [Frank] Smoke your own. - Gimme a cigarette. - No, it's my last one. Look, that's it. - Well give it to me. I'll buy you a pack. Jesus Christ. - [Frank] I'm so hungry I could eat that egg-suckin' dog. - I'm glad you brought those beans, Leonard. - I always bring beans. - You sure do. Here you go, kid, here are some beans. - [Leonard] Cup of coffee? - [Frank] Yeah, maybe it'll settle your nerves. - [Karl] You better eat somethin', Buddy Owen. You'll get hungry later. - Damn, it's hot. - Well maybe it'll burn some of that fat off you. - Oh yeah? - Mm hm. What do you weigh now, Leonard, about 400? Goddamn it. - Wanna go a few rounds? - Yeah, maybe I do. Yeah, maybe I do. Hey, you're pretty light on your feet there, big guy. - Don't go by looks, Frank. (coughing) - Isn't it a little hot for you guys to be horsing around? - It's okay, Karl, we were just foolin' around. Ain't that right, Leonard? - What the hell are you doin'? - I don't like bein' hit in the stomach. - I ought to kill you for that, Frank. - [Karl] What the hell's the matter with you, Frank? - I don't know. Maybe I'm hungover, I don't know. Hey, Buddy Owen, come on, let's arm wrestle, eh? Come on, don't be a chicken shit all your life. Come on, let's go. Boy, I ain't dirty, come on. Come on down here, put your arm here. That's right. Go. You didn't even try. Karl, that kid of yours, he couldn't win if he was playin' alone. The hell's wrong with him? - [Karl] Ain't nothin' wrong with him. - Yeah, how's your arm then? Come on, big guy. - My arm, Frank, is o-fuckin'-kay. - Hit it. I gotcha, Karl, I got you. - You wanna tell Leonard? You wanna tell the world that you got me? Nice goin', yeah. Yeah, you got me. What's the matter, Frank? You used to be tough. Maybe that little lady's takin' too much out of you. - [Leonard] Yeah, after your wife ran off with a circus dwarf. - [Frank] Shut up! - I remember the time you could pin every man in a bar, the Rainbow Bar. You pinned every one, remember? - You were always a lot tougher than I was, Karl. - It's old age, Frank, don't worry about it. It happens to the best of us. - Very funny, Leonard. You want some beans or somethin', kid? Come on. Why is he so moody? I mean, what's wrong with you anyway? - [Karl] Ain't nothin' wrong with him. - No? - No. - Now goddamn it, there's something wrong. He's mad at somebody. If it's me, I want you to tell me. - He don't like you, Frank. - I don't give a good goddamn what he likes, Leonard. If he's mad at me, I want him to say it. - [Karl] He ain't mad at you. - He's weird, that kid is weird. He don't talk, he don't do nothin'. He's got a long way to go to bein' a man, Karl. I'm gonna tell you somethin'. You know, nobody expects you to come on out here and learn how to hunt and drink and fuck all in one weekend. But it ain't my fault you're here. You know, it ain't my idea. If somethin' happens, that's life. But don't be mad at me about it. - For the last time, he ain't mad at you. You got that? Now we been talkin' long enough. We should do some shootin'. I've seen a lot of jacks while we were standin' around wastin' time, alright? - I just don't want him to be mad at me. - You wanna come with me, son. - No. - I'm gonna start on the far side over the hill. - See you guys later. See you later, okay? - Damn, I wish I had my teeth. - Ah, what is that? Goddamn, what happened? (gunshot banging) (gunshot banging) - Blast ya good, yeah. Get in there. (upbeat funky music) (gunshot banging) Come on. Get off of there. Get over here. (gunshot banging) You little bugger. (gunshot banging) Hey! Hey kid, what are you doin'? What's goin' on? Hey! (gunshot banging) Hey, what the hell are you doin'? What's goin' on? - I'm havin' a huntin' party, Frank, care to join me? (gunshot banging) - Hey, hey, what's gotten into you? - Texas lightning, ain't that what you boys wanted? (gunshot banging) - Put that gun down! - Why, Frank, you don't think I can handle a gun? (gunshot banging) - Hey! I don't think you're a good enough shot, kid. (gunshot banging) God. - I'm as good as you boys taught me. - Hey Frank, what's goin' on? What's all the shooting? What the hell's goin' on, Frank? (gunshot banging) Shit. - Drop the gun belt. - Are you crazy, Buddy Owen? - Alright, Buddy Owen, enough is enough! - You're right, Frank. Enough is enough. (gunshot banging) Do you still think I'm weird, Frank? - Hey, man, I never meant any of that. I didn't mean it, you know. If I said somethin' wrong, I'm sorry. - Isn't this neat, Leonard? - Yeah, neat. - Just put it away. - You guys wanna teach me how to be a man, right? You're gonna teach me how to hunt, fuck, and drink, right? Let's have a little target practice. You are the rhinoceros. - Yeah. - You are the pig. (gunshots banging) - [Frank] Don't shoot us, Buddy Owen! (gunshots banging) (shouting) - You want me to be a man?
