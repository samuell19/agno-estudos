Why don't you stop crying, Mia? Stop crying. You little piece of shit. Hey... Hey, look at me. Look at me. I've had enough of you. - Sorry, daddy. Do you even love me? - I love you, dad. Shut up. Don't look at your mother, look at me. - I love you, daddy. It's me you're supposed to be with, not your fucking brother. Anders? Fuck, I've missed you. I've missed you too. Are you happy? - Yes, and you? Ready? I can't believe you're actually sitting next to me right now. It's been so long. How is it going anyway? Not too bad. Have you have found a job yet? Yes... As a fucking dishwasher. Nice. - Yeah right. It's better than nothing. - That's exactly what it is. Are you seeing someone? No... Are you picky? You could say that. Are you sleeping at my place tonight? - Yes. I don't have any other plans. I'll find something else within a couple of days. Stop it, Anders. You know you're always welcome at my place. Okay. Thanks. Just throw your stuff in here. Is it okay if I smoke in here? - Sure, no problem. What the hell is that? - It's my snake. He's been taking care of me while you were gone. Is it yours? - Of course it's mine. Where did you buy it? - At a pet store. What's his name? - Nothing. You have to name it something. - I don't think he cares. It's a nice place you've got. - Yeah, it's okay. How is the rent? - Not that bad. How long have you lived here? - A couple of years. The woman who owns it is ver y nice. Have you seen mom recently? I visit her sometimes. Are you gonna go see her? I don't see any point in going. The doctors say she can feel when you're there. I really don't think she wants me there. Anders, I think you should go visit her sometime. We can go together. Let's see what happens. All right. What's up? Are we getting drunk tonight? - Of course. We have to celebrate that you're finally out of prison. A GOD WITHOUT A UNIVERSE Hey Mia. Long time no see. Welcome. - This is Simon... And the beautiful girl here is Camilla. Mia. - Where's your brother? He's in the other room. Where can I put my jacket? - Just throw it somewhere. You don't have to ask a girl for permission, Simon. Stop it, Aske. So you must be Anders? - Yes, hey. I'm Camilla. Look at what those bastards let out! It's so good to see you. - You too. This is for you, faggot. - Thanks. Hey Simon. What's up? - Hey Anders. It's been a while. How's everything? - It's good. Good to see you. What the fuck are you wearing? - It's the old man's shirt. Shut up. - You look like my granddad. You're a real man now. - 10 fucking years. Let's get something to drink. Cheers. Simon, did you know that my girlfriend isvery jealous? What are you talking about? Because I'm hanging out with a fag like you. My best friend is Anders, then the snake, then Aske. Is it good to have your brother out? - Yeah it's great. He is very lucky to have such a nice sister as you. Sure. You really have become a beautiful woman. What are you talking about? - I said you're very hot. I'm gonna go get some vodka. Come on. What's up? I'm just getting a beer. - Are you okay? I'm totally fine. This is the closest you'll ever get to real pussy. Do you want some? - What's in it? Come on, you need some fun. How do you know my brother? Today is the first time I've met him. I know him through Aske. I've heard a lot about him from Simon. He's your brother's biggest fan. I know. This is all for you Anders. There's something about you. You don't know me at all. - I can still think you're interesting. You and your brother arever y fascinating. Are you all right? Mia? Are you okay? What are you doing Simon? Simon, I think your mother called... It's a whore named Lone. Do you want some? Be nice to your sister. - Just shut up, Simon. Fuck. Her nose is bleeding. Come on, Mia. Simon, pull yourself together. Seriously, get him under control. Did you drink all the vodka? Oops. I thought I was the only fucked up in this family. I've really missed you, Anders. Please don't leave me again. I'm not going anywhere. What the fuck? What a night. Can I?? WHERE ARE YOU? Wake up. - Sorry. Are you ready for this? Huh? - Yes. I'm ready. You better be. - I'm ready, Anders. Let's go. What is it, Anders? - Are you fixing your hair? Well, it's Aske. Are you afraid you're not pretty enough for Aske? That's not it. Come on. Come on. - Yes. What's up, fuckheads? Thanks for yesterday. - You too. What's up, you drunk bastard? Are you sober yet? - Yes. I'm sorry it's back to work already, but that's business. It's fine. What's wrong, Simon? You look like you're going to shit your pants. No, I don't. - What the fuck is wrong with you!? Nothing. I need to know he's ready. - You're ready for this, right? I am. - That's good Simon. Here's the keys for thevan. You're going to pick it up right away. David is waiting. Okay. We got an order for one blond and one brunette, two Danish girls. Can you handle that? - Of course. Make sure he's up for it. - I will. That's it, see you later. - See you. It's Anders, leave a? It's Anders, leave a message... Hey Anders, it's Mia. Where are you? Why aren't you answering your phone? Can you please call me back? I think we need to talk about what happened last night. I don't know? Please just call me. Hey mom. Anders got out today. I picked him up at the prison yesterday. I told him to come visit you. But I don't think he wants to. No matter what demons you and dad thought he had, they are gone now. I know it. And I promise to give him all the love you couldn't give to him. Hey Mia. So how's it going? Are you okay? I'm fine. Has anyone visited my mom today? No, only you. Were you expecting someone? No, not at all. Mia, let me know if you need anything, okay? Or if you need to talk to someone. Sure, thanks. I understand why this must be difficult for you. Thanks. Okay. I'm right out in the hallway if you need anything. Oh right, and there is coffee out there as well. Feel free to take some. I can't do this. I can't. - Simon, for fucks sake. Don't. What are you doing? - I can't do this. You can't do this? What are you talking about? - Anders, I can't do this. What the hell are you talking about? What do you think Aske will say if we don't do this right now? Aske needs to shut up. Do you think we should tell Aske to shut up? Should we honestly tell him to shut up? - Yes! Then you will fucking tell him. - I fucking hate Aske. Just shut the fuck up, Simon. Relax. What are you doing? Take some of this. Okay? Come on. Let's do it. Then let's do it. Do it. Fuck this. Hey. What's up? Are you drunk? - Yeah. It's fucking hot in here. - What does that matter? Are you happy? - Yeah. Are you here alone? - Pretty much. Hopefully not for long. - What about you? I'm here with my friend. - Who's your friend? It's Simon, he's sitting right over there. Hey Simon! You wanna go to our place? Let's go Maria, come on. - We have a car. Sure, okay. Are you living close by? - It's not too far from here. Watch your step. - Be careful Lulu. Have you had a fun night? - Really good, right Lulu? We'll have a fun night now. We have found ourselves a really nice guy here. Relax. Is that your car? - Yes. What a serial killer car. You are not gonna rape us, right? So is it your car or Simon's car? - It's my car. Shut up. Shut up. Fuck, that was sick man. Yes! Did you see how I smashed her right in the head? What time are we supposed to be at Aske's? What time is it? It's half past 2. - Huh? Half past 2. We have an hour. - An hour? Okay, fine. Stop the car. - What? What are you talking about? I said, stop the car! What the fuck are you talking about? I can't stop the car here! Stop the car, now! Okay. Okay. I'll stop the car. Keep an eye out! Let her go. - Shut up. Just leave her alone, Simon. What if someone sees us? Go be with the other one. Go be with the other one! Come to Simon. You are mine. I'm not gonna leave you. Go be with the other one, Anders. I said, go be with the other one! I won't tell anybody if you let me go. I promise. I can't help you, okay? What's your plan then? You are with Simon now. You are a fucking beast, Anders. It's Mia. Hey Mia, it's Camilla. Hey? How are you feeling? Are you hungover? How did you get my number? Your brother gave it to me at the party. Okay, so what's up? Not much, I thought we could do something together? Okay? Why don't you stop by my place? I don't know where you live? I could pick you up? Fine. Cool, see you soon. Hey gorgeous. Hey. Get on. Welcome. Take a seat, I'll find us some wine. Have you seen my brother today? - No, why? No reason, I just haven't seen him. I wouldn't think too much of it, he is probably just with Aske. Cheers. Cheers. So do you want to be with my brother? No, it's nothing serious. Boys are not to be trusted. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend? No, I don't. Boys must be lined up at your door. What are you doing? What are those? It's nothing. Why do you hide them? - Because they're ugly. Now you are just being stupid. We all have our demons. We just have to accept them. You are weird. Who the fuck is that? What are you doing here? I had an appointment. - No, you didn't. I'm pretty sure it was today. - I'm just gonna check my calendar. Okay, I've messed up. I'm very sorry, but I've made a double booking, so... I kind of have a visit right now. But if you'll just wait here, I'll be quick about it. Come on in. So, this is my friend Mia. Hello there. Hey. Are you sure she won't tell anyone that I'm seeing you? Shut the fuck up, of course not. I just wanted to make sure. Go lay down on all fours, I'll come whenever I feel like it. I'll just go change. What's going on? Well, you have to earn your money one way or another. He wants the door left open, is that fine by you? I guess. Now I don't want to listen to you anymore. Time to shut you up. You dirty bastard. Bad, bad boy. Look down. How old are you? How old are you? 17. What are you saying? - 17. And how old are you then? 16. 16? We will make a fortune on you. Looks good boys, me and David will take over from here. Can I keep her? - Simon! What are you talking about? She's mine, I own her. - Shut up Simon. I just fucked her. - What did you say? I'm just as much a man as you are now. You're a fucking nobody, Simon! - Relax! Shut the fuck up, Anders. Take your things and leave! Fuck off! Leave! What's up, sweetheart? Haven't we talked about this? Is mom asleep? Listen to me, there are no such things as monsters. Not under your bed at least. You know that dad is busy. I'm not home before tomorrow. Then go wake up mom. What has she done? Did she take sleeping pills? Goddammit. Then put on some of your cartoons, just do something. Don't interrupt daddy when I'm busy. Fine. See you tomorrow. Bye sweetheart. Well then? Thank you for today. I'll see you next week then. How can you do that? What? Have so much confidence? What are you talking about? I could never do that. Come. Come here. Take off your clothes. What are you saying? You need to understand how beautiful you are. Take it off. Are you all right, baby? Where have you been? Anders? I can't help you, okay? What's your plan then? Suck my cock. - What? Didn't you hear me? What the hell are you doing? Anders! Let go! I can't do this anymore. Yes you can. We all can. Anders. I don't want to go on. - Stop. I can't do this anymore. - Anders, stop! What are you talking about, Anders? You need to stop. Relax. I know how you feel. You don't know what I am. Anders... You're my only happiness. - No, I'm not, Mia! That's who you are, do you understand? You're my only happiness. That's who you are, understood? You're mine, and I'm yours. Does it hurt? That's good. It will all be all right, it's just a matter of time. It's my fault. It's not your fault. It's my fault she's lying there. - It's not your fault, Anders. This is my fault. - No it's not. Look at me, Anders. Please understand that this is not your fault. None of it. Of course it's my fault. You're perfect, Anders. You're so perfect. Who's fault is it then? Stop crying, Mia. Stop crying, you little piece of shit. You don't love me anymore? What did I do to you? I love you dad, I promise. - Stop your lies. The only thing you do is lie to me. Hey? Hey, look at me. Look at me. I've had enough of you. - Sorry, daddy. Do you even love me? - I love you, dad. Shut up. Don't look at your mother, look at me. I love you, daddy. - I don't want to hear your bullshit. What have I ever done to you? I love you, daddy, I love you. - You love me? Fucking bullshit. You lie to me all the time. - But I love you, daddy. Stop saying that! I'm sick of your lies! It's me you're supposed to be with, not your fucking brother. Do you understand? - It wasn't my fault! Not your fault? I don't want you two touching each other! It's me you're supposed to touch! Take off your pants. Anders? Just fucking die! Stop it, you're killing him! Did you like it when dad touched you? Mia? What's happening? What's going on? Mia, what are you doing? What the fuck? Look at me! Mia, goddammit! Mia, for fuck's sake, listen to me! You have to push it out! Push! Come on! Now! Again! Keep going! What are those? It's nothing. Why do you hide them? - Because they're ugly. Now you are just being stupid. We all have our demons. We just have to accept them.
