- Mom, have you seen my hat? I'm running late. - Did you check your closet, far left, upper shelf? - How do you know where everything is? - The real question is, how did you lose such a ridiculous hat? - Ridiculous. Wait till you hear how much they pay me. - When you work until? - 11. They close. - Well, do not wake me up, okay? Should have packed weeks ago. - Oh, come on. Who's gonna fold my socks in those weird little origami shapes? - Well, you know I can't sleep unless you're sleeping too. - Perfect. It'll be the OG duo getting your baby ready for West Fern. - All right, baby, well, be ready 5:00 AM sharp. - All right, have to go. I need this last paycheck. Love you. - All right, here we go, cuddle again. Meat Sleeves. Yeah. There we go. - All right, can we get a Meat Sleeve between Portia and I? Oh, social media team will love this. Here we go. Right between us. Oh, that's so good. There you go. That is great. - What are you doing? - Oh, TikTok team's gonna animate the Meat Sleeve, you know, make it twerk. Woo, woo, woo. Or say who got the juice? - You're so silly. - No, not that, this party. - Oh, well, it's a big day, tomorrow my daughter goes to West Fern, the same elite institution where I invented the Meat Sleeve. Huh? The only freezer snack to melt roast beef inside tortillas. - Oh, so smart. - Okay, but when you throw a party for someone, you usually tell them, or at least invite them. - I just figured you'd hear the music. You know, it's a surprise. And our partners from China in town, and we needed something to welcome them so. - Oh, wait. - That is great. - I was practicing. - Yeah, that is great, Portia. And definitely not racist at all. So first you make me go to West Fern and then you throw me a party, but it's actually just an excuse for you to kiss up to your foreign investors. - No, no way. Look, this is all for you. - Clear. - Obviously. - Bell, come on. I couldn't be more proud of you, sweetie. - No, you're proud of yourself for having a daughter at West Fern. I should not have even gotten in with my grades. - Wait, we talked about this, the board took our philanthropy under consideration. - What philanthropy? Giving NFTs to Orphans isn't charity. - How was I supposed to know they didn't have smartphones? Look, we both agreed that the board of directors would look favorably upon West Fern and then one day the Meat Sleeve empire would be yours. - Agreed? We agreed? I, I've gone along with your plan for this long because well, I'm a rather apathetic person and I have a brand to protect and I've never had a choice. Let's not pretend I chose West Fern, this party, or really anything to do with my future. - Oh, honey, come on. - You should go back to your party because Portia's birthday is in a few weeks and she's gonna turn 26 and then she'll be too old for you. Right, Leo? - Bell. Yeah. - I want my money. - Calm down, okay? - Right now. - Everything's under control right. - Right now. - Is it easier to clean knowing it's your last day? - Honestly? Yes, I'm sorry. - It makes sense that you're leaving me to die in the Titanic. - Ooh, the ironies not lost on me. - And of all places you're going to West Fern, I mean that schools for actual geniuses. Meanwhile, I will still be here in this hell hole serving entrees that are as tasteless as the decor. Do you know how lucky you are? - Lucky? I worked two part-time jobs. Three, if you count, tutoring a football player who thought Joe Rogan was in Senate. I spent weekends training for cross country, a sport I picked because it's literally running away from your hometown. And in the process, I ditched any semblance of a social life just to pad my college application. God, I had to take my cousin to prom. - What a sweetie. - I don't need your pity. Even after all that, with two scholarships and a state grant, I'll be paying off loans till my mid 70's. But I'm 1% closer to running a Fortune 500 company. A dream I'm already statistically not likely to achieve because I'm a woman. But yes, I'm very lucky. - Speaking of Fortune 500, isn't Annabella French going to West Fern? - Yeah, she's the only other person from my school who got in. - Do you know her? - No. I don't think she's spoken to me in four years. - Her dad is the guy who paid a hundred million to be the first civilian in a fart in space, right? - Yeah. - That's cool. Well maybe you and the nepo baby will hit it off. - Come on, she's gotten everything she's wanted since birth. And I'm stuck with my uncle's 2002 laptop that has a virus called Halle Berry "Swordfish" Scene Dot Vid. We have nothing in common. I was valedictorian. Annabella claimed she had a learning disability so she could take tests at Dave & Busters. I won best dressed, Annabella went through a juggalo phase. I sang "Rolling in the Deep" for the talent show. Annabella recited original poetry that just ended up being Jaden Smith Tweets. - How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real? - I've never even eaten the Meat Sleeve. - Her Instagram is just a bunch of pictures of smiling dogs. - Yeah, she's a troll. - Okay, well it's better than not having an account at all. - I told you future employers look at your social media. So I hope that beer pong pic from sophomore year was worth it. - You know, I don't know why Annabella never talked to you. I mean, you seem like so much fun. - You're gonna need new shelving for these books. I'll order it. - No, you don't need to spend any more money. I'm fine. - Honey, I picked up overtime just for this. Now listen, you are the family's first college student and I need you to be as comfortable as possible. - I'm so sorry. - Don't be. These were a gift for my dad's girlfriend and I hated them, so thank you. - Well, what in the world was that? - Annabella French. She lives on my floor. - Queen Meat Sleeves? - Yeah. - That's good, right? You got a friend nearby friend. - Friend? No. She's such a- - Raury Sanders, college is a fresh start for everyone. Do you know how nice it would be if you just march right over there and ask her if she needs anything? You are right next door, young lady. - No way. I don't even know her at all. - Well, you never know when you might make a lifelong friend. - Everyone stay calm. We have a lot of clean drinking water for now. I know how to survive. I was at Fyre Fest. Stay calm! It's gonna be fine! - Whoa, whoa, oh wow, yeah, yeah, so that was exciting. - Yeah, I heard the fire alarm gets pulled like once a week. - Please tell me that you were run for the exit every time. You never know there might be a real fire. - Yes, Mom, I promise I will run when there's a real fire. The FBI deals with pulled fire alarms? - Yeah, well maybe they've had enough. - Oh good. I need my sleep because this week I'm finding a new job. I'm betting lots of businesses hirer around the school year. - I know how hard you work. I wish I could have made it easier for you. - Honestly, I wouldn't trade my life for all the money in the world. I love you and I've always known how much you love me. - All right, all right, all right. Well it's not like I'm not gonna call you every five minutes. You deserve this. - Jello. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I say jello instead of hello. It's my little joke. I never would've done it if I knew it would scare you. - No, it's fine. I'm just not used to the silence yet. - Soon the sounds of college will ring loudly through the halls. Enjoy the quiet while you can. Are you getting service here? - It's spotty. - Yeah, things have been buggy since the outage. - Mm-hmm. - Oh. I skipped a whole step here. I'm the floor's RA. My name is Perry Gomez, but everyone calls me Eggs. - Eggs? - Yeah, it's a long story. Actually, it's not, it's super short. People think I smell like eggs. It's probably a genetic thing or diet. I've embraced it. I'm a survivor. I'm gonna make it. I will survive. Keep on surviving. - Good for you. Yeah. - Yeah, thank you. So I'm just here for a little head count. A little late because of that old fire alarm thing. Ugh. I suspect the girl with the side pony in room 223 pulled it. Side ponies are shady as hell. - Uh, uh, so do you need anything from me or? - Nope. Just a big smile for your first day of college tomorrow. Let me see it. All the way. Teeth. There it is. My work here is done. Well if you need anything or have any questions, I'm right at the end of the hall. Just yell Eggs and I'll scramble. Get it? - Yeah. - It's an egg pun. - Yeah. - Oh, and the cafeteria's open till 11:00 PM if you need a little late night snack. I don't know I winked, that made it weird. Okay, sleep well, Annabella. - Thanks. - That rhymes. - How long has that been out? - I don't know. It's my first day. - Oh. I think something in the salad just moved. - Yeah. - Are you guys also too excited to sleep? - No, I just took an Ambien, I'm waiting for it to kick in. - And I work here. - Oh, just, just kicked in. - Hey, um, do you think you could help me kill whatever's in the salad? - Yeah, why not? - Perfect, I'll get the knife. Stay right there. Psst, hey, it's the food guy. I got you a seat, come on. - I'll just go over there. - My name's Arnold, by the way. - Hey everybody. Welcome class of 2027. - That's us. - I am Dean Cain and okay, let's just get all the laughing out right now. My first name's really Steven, so although I am a Dean Cain here at work, I am not a Superman yet. Not yet. And no, I can't set any of you up with Terry Hatcher, so don't even ask. Forget about it. See "The Sopranos"? Forget about it. All right, with tat out of the way, I know we all had a very exciting start with the power outage yesterday, which I am told was a thwarted foreign computer hack. That's just like the 1994 Sandra Bullock movie, "The Net" where she was attacked by the internet. It's not a bad little thriller. It's a little dated now, you know. Strangely, it has Dennis Miller in it. What's he doing there? Dennis Miller. But I'm here to bring some energy back to this campus and I'm going to say West Fern is ready for the future of our country. We are all still waiting though, to get fully back on line, so please excuse the delay and just hang with us. We're gonna work this thing out together. Before we leave you though, just on a personal note, I just want you to treat this day with the respect and solemnity that it deserves because this is the first day of the rest of your, excuse me. The first day of the rest. The first day of the rest of your lives. - So we're like friends now, right? - Uh, I think there's a problem with my schedule. - I know mine too. 8:00 AM on Fridays, they want me to die? - No, I mean like, this isn't my schedule. I didn't sign up for any of these classes. - Oh yeah, look, there's just a bunch of numbers where your name should be. - I'm gonna go find the dean. - Annabella French. - Oh, excuse me. - Oh, and how can I help you? - Um, it seems that I maybe got the wrong schedule. - Alrighty, well, let's just take a look here. Okay. I know that we're still fixing the hack, but I was told that everything was correct and double checked. - I can promise you that's not right. I mean, there's not even a name on it. - Oh yeah, that does look weird. Okay, so why don't you email my office with your student ID? I will personally make sure that this thing gets fixed. I'm told that we will have our email back up and running in five working days. - Five days? - Uh-huh. - No way, it's the first week of classes. What am I supposed to do? - Well, first of all, please stop yelling. Just calm down. It's been a really busy first week. And you know, the computer hacks and all that stuff, it's really hard. Also, we're pretty lazy, so we will get to it. You have my word, which has been very strong since I stopped drinking. - Hey, honey. - Have you brutally murdered any endangered species yet? - No, Bell. We're still on the flight to Mozambique. That happened once and honestly who even need rhinos? Huh? I wanted to talk to you real quick because I spoke with Dean Cain this morning and he assured me that your schedule is, how do I put this? Catered to your needs. - Catered to my needs. - Yes. You know, with your strengths in mind. We have done a lot for this school. I don't wanna say that they owe me, but they owe me. - Right. - Yeah, happy to do it for you though. Listen, I'm gonna get some shuteye, okay? We land in a few hours, but you have a great first day. - Okay. - Jesus Christ, Amancio. I said, no cleaning your gun on the jet. - And what do I expect of you beyond just your attention in class? I expect your passion. Each one of you has already proven you're among the top 5% of West Fern's freshman class, but brains will only get you so far. Only the strong will survive. And so I ask, how many of you will I be seeing at the optional group discussion at the end of the day? Okay. - A lot of people think Donkey Kong. They're wrong. You pick Yoshi. Everyone knows that at this point. It's easier to move around when you're a smaller character. Whether you're Toadstool. - What might we use to solve something like this? How about you, miss, you wanna take a shot? - Me? - Yes, you. What would you use to solve a problem like this? - To solve it? - Yes, that would be the goal in advanced physics class. - Advanced physics, right? Okay, so do all problems really need to be solved though? I mean, it's always a letdown, you know? Don't let it ruin what you've got going. It's like Jared Leto making music. - Okay, my young philosopher, let's get to the answer. - Um, the, the chain rule. - Chain rule. That is a good guess. Even if it is just the words written on the board behind me here. You know, in the future it might be easier just to admit you don't know something. Even if it is something basic for an advanced class. Does anyone else wanna give it a shot? - Hey! My Greek myth professor looks very much like a duck, which is gonna make it hard for me to focus because I love ducks. What's wrong? - I'm in all these classes that I can't even believe exist. Next, I'm scheduled for something called Advanced Connect Four. And I've had no bars all day, I can't even email the school. - Girl, you are way too stressed out for day one. Chill out and come with me at the bookstore. Come on. Okay, last one. Where do you think cinema is? - I have to buy "Gone Girl". What does that have to do with the business degree? - Listen, I mean, all my classes seem normal. I don't know what to tell you. Oh, there it is. - I don't even know why I'm buying these books. - You know, most people would be thrilled to be taking it easy, okay? This is one of the hardest schools in the country. I honestly wish my classes were a little easier. - Well, I didn't come to West Fern for this. - Total is $220.56. Are you paying with student funds? - I think I have enough. I'm waiting on a check from my old job. - I can look it up. - Oh. - You have $35,000 available. - What? - $35,000? - Uh, can't be. - Says right here, $35,000, Annabella French. - Oh, that's a mistake. That's not me. - Sure does look like you. - Whoa, rich girl. - No, no, I went to school with Annabella. That's not right. And my schedule's wrong. Oh, wait a sec. - I get it you're undercover bossing me. Very humble. - Give me back the card. Um, I have 40 bucks. What will that get me? - Um. This one. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. - Hey, I don't know why you hide that you're rich. If I was rich, I would literally tell everybody. - I'm not Annabella French, but it does all make sense now. - Dollars and cents, you're basically a Hadid. What? - Yeah, bye, bye. - Hello. - Jesus. - Did you design this place or did you just say Ikea into the mirror three times and everything just appeared. - Give this to me. - Oh. - All right, Annabella or whatever you want to call yourself. Kappa Tau Phi throwing a house party tonight, so I'll just leave the address here. See you at 10:00. It's okay that you're rich. - What have you done? Is this some type of prank the 1% pulls? - Oh, I had nothing to do with this. I knew something was actually wrong though when all my professors were actual doctors, not like Dr. Oz doctors. - Wait, what? - They think I'm you. And I'm pretty sure I went to all your classes. By the way, what is your major? Solving the matrix? - How do you know it was me? - When they called me Raury when I got kicked outta the massage center. - There's a massage center? - Yeah, it's right next to the boba place, which is apparently another spot that you cannot get into. - Boba? I love boba. - Yeah, you and me both. I hear they have fire strawberry tea. - Really? Wait, get out of my room. I'm emailing Dean Cain to reverse whatever this is. - It was probably the hack. I mean, I bet we're not the only mix up. - Well, the only one I care about. Isn't this something your dad can fix? - Technically, yes. - Then what are you waiting for? This has to be the freaky Friday for you. I mean, you're one of us normies now. - Well, I was thinking, what if we just waited out? I mean, the internet is all messed up anyway. No one's gonna get your email. Why don't we just have fun with it for a few days? - Oh, so you're an insane person. Good to know. I'm just saying let's not do anything about it right now and then come next Monday you're you again. - That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. - Is it though? I mean, you get to live like a rich college student experiencing what it's like to have your last name on a building. Boba is just the start. - And what do you get out of all this? - Honestly, I'm not sure. But today was the first time that people expected more from me. Actually, it was the first time that anybody expected anything from me because nobody saw me as Meat Sleeves's girl. It was exhilarating to be invisible. - Invisible? - Yeah. - That's a very cool way of describing me. - Oh, come on, you know what I meant? - I do know what you meant. And that's why you're the last person on Earth, I'd wanna trade places with. I'm not pretending to be some self-centered spoiled brat just because it makes you feel human. - Do you have student loans? - Oh, so now you're gonna poor shame me? - What if I paid your student loans for the semester? - What are you talking about? - The entire semester zero balance. It's better than whatever job you're gonna be shoehorning into your schedule. You'll be taking my stupid classes, exploiting my privilege. You can use my student credit. I'll give you my credit card. Hell, you can even drive my car. - For a week? - One week. Consider it an experiment. - I mean, was anybody suspicious today? A teacher or anybody? - No, not really. - If we get busted, we'll both be expelled and I actually want to be here. - Okay, then I will email Dean Cain today, that way when the internet is back up, it goes to the top of the list, you have literally nothing to lose. - And then you pay for the loan? - End of the week. Direct deposit, or Venmo, or Sephora gift cards. Whatever you want. Except you literally cannot tell anyone. No parents, no friends, no one. That's technically cheating. - Okay. This is the stupidest thing I've ever done in my entire life. - Wish I could say the same. Can you believe this was ever a thing? In my defense it was the first time that I was drunk. - Do you have somewhere else to be? - First give me your phone. I'll put my number in. Okay, starting today you are officially Annabella French, sole heir to the Meat Sleeves's kingdom and I am Raury, God, what is your last name? - Sanders. - Oh, Raury Sanders. - Look at you, girl. - Hey. - This party is just getting started. Let's stay for like 20 minutes and then leave. - Arnold Krabble. Ms. Annabella French. - Thank you. - So how are you rich anyways? Old money, new money, Dogecoin? - Uh, my dad owns Meat Sleeves. - He owns Meat Sleeves? I had six for lunch. You're like American royalty. - Oh, not really. - What's your favorite flavor? - Of Meat Sleeve? - Yeah. - Cheese. - Cheese and what? - Cheese and rice. - Cheese and rice? I don't know if I've heard of that one before. - Oh, it's, it's a test flavor. - Holy shit, you get unreleased Meat Sleeves. You're like the Willy Wonka of roast beef. Mine's grape. Two, please. - Thank you. - And just like that we're besties, which is actually great news because I know everybody we need to be friends with. - Hmm. - Yeah, I used to sneak into these places all the time when I was in high school. You see that girl in the green top? - Mm-hmm. - That's Lucy Peenobottom. Her grandfather invented the earplug. - Earplug? That's wild. - Crazy rich. And that girl she's talking to, that's Fritzy Gats. Her mom coined the phrase #winetime. - That's a thing? - Yeah, and now every time some basic bitch wears it on a t-shirt, she gets like four bucks. She's also a flat-earther. And that is Diana Clorox. - Her parents own Clorox. - Oh, they're pediatricians. I think that's just a common German name. - Ooh. - Hey. - Whoa shit. Where the, did you come from? That's crazy. Hey, listen, while you're here, I'm trying to find Alyssa. Y'all seen her? - Sorry, I don't know Alyssa. - Me neither, man. - You don't? You serious? If you don't know Alyssa, how are you here? Yo, yo, yo, they don't know Alyssa. Are you guys cops? - What? - You look like cops. You specifically look like a narc. - I'm not a narc. - You'd legally have to tell me that you are. That's the law. My dad's a lawyer, so I know. He'll sue the shit outta you. He wants sued Hawaiian Bread for having too many carbs. Took him to court. - Please, excuse Griff. He's been drinking on an empty brain. You know what? I heard they're playing flip cup inside. - Bro, flip cup. All right. Later narcs. - I'm sorry, that guy's a dick wad. My name's Brooks. - Arnold Krabble. Annabella French. Meat Sleeves. - You guys freshman? - Is it that obvious? - No, it's just, I'd remember you. Have you been here long? - We just got here. - Oh, well I hope you didn't have to wait in line long, school's got these really strict rules, so now we gotta throw parties at our own houses. - Are you Kappa Tau Pi? - Yeah. - Huh. - And now we got these guest lists regulated by the school. - Really? I mean, what would happen if you caught someone like sneaking in? - Oh school suspends you for like three months. Oh no. I can get you some water. One of the few perks of being in the frat is I get to cut the line. - Uh, yeah, she'd love that. And can you get me another beer? Oh, uh, do you have asthma? 'Cause I have an Adderall, if that would help. - Hi, Raury Sanders. Okay, wow. - Oh, hey. Is everything cool? - I've never been rejected from a party before. - Oh, I'm sorry. I can ask Arnold to let you. - Are you kidding me? I don't wanna go to this shit. Your name is already paying off. - Great. - I'm gonna go get my dorm together. Have fun. Also definitely cover your drink. Bye, Annabella. - Annabella. Hey, Annabella, it's Eggs. Annabella French. Beep, beep, beep, beep. Hey, hey, hey, hey you. Might have to get those ears checked. Campus clinic's open 24 hours. - Sorry, I'm just in my head. That's all. - Sounds like a great place to visit. Get in loser, we're going to class. - What? - Hop in, shotgun's all yours. - It's fine. I'm just gonna walk. - Ms. French, I was sent a cart request from administration because of your shin splints. So let's get going. - I don't have those. I'm, I'm gonna walk. - Come on, I'm already out and I have to go there anyway. And you're running late. - Okay. - All hands and feet inside the vehicle. Where we're going we don't need roads or seat belts. Hang on. Wee! So I'm not supposed to say anything, but the school told me how important your dad is. He's a pretty big deal. - That's what I've been told. - I'm a huge Meat Sleeves fan and a marketing major. So you know, a connection like this is what makes West Fern the greatest school on the planet. It's my resume. My number's on there too. You can call me whenever. I'll bring the car to you wherever you are. Anytime, seriously. You know what, actually, let me just put my number in your phone for you. - Oh, I'm fine. - No seriously. Let me take it. - Okay. - Mush, mush, here we go. Precious cargo everyone. That's you. Okay. Here's your stop. Remember to leave me a four star review. I'm just kidding, there are no reviews. Bye. - Hey, is this intro to "Ice Age"? - Yeah, yeah. I love these movies. Yeah, we're doing the sequels next. Can't wait. - And the American Meteorology Center agreed. They found that the resulting anomalies were most negative in the Caspian Sea and most positive in the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. More things you'll never fully grasp. I may as well be speaking Armenian. And now you're falling asleep, Annabella. You're falling asleep. What they discovered was the greenhouse gas levels continued to rise, reaching an 800,000 year peak. And in turn, radiative forcing also hit record levels. All of these measurements are due exclusively to human activity. - More like corporate sabotage. - Who said that? Okay, great. If you want to contribute, I mean, you're more than welcome to elaborate. - I mean, for years we were told to drive a Prius and conserve water by taking three minute showers. But the damage done by industrial pollution and waste is so severe, there's nothing any of us could do to stop the destruction of the planet. It's the inevitable conclusion to capitalism. - Fantastic. That's great. I feel like we're gonna have a lot of fun in this class this year. Unfortunately, we're out of time, so please try to bring this vibe back when I see you all again on Thursday. Thank you. - Hey, hey! Hey. Um you're Annabella French, right? - Uh, yeah. Yes, it's, yes. - I mean, we heard rumors you were here, but without a TikTok account, we didn't know if we'd ever find you. - There's like no pictures of you on the internet. - I guess I like being mysterious. - Very Kristen Stewart of you. - Well, uh, we are hosting a freshman banquet on Thursday night and we would love for you to attend. - We're Chi Thetas the longest running and most prestigious sorority here at West Fern. We went viral last year. - Yeah, one of our junior girls actually dressed up a sexy Stone Cold for Halloween and Barstool posted a picture so. - Cool. - Great, we'll put you down for Thursday night. - Oh, oh, I'm not sure I can. - Were you just talking to Chi Thetas? - I think so. - Amazing. Man, their hair is so nice. What are you doing right now? - I have to go back and buy those books. - That's boring. - Why, what are you doing? - A funnel cake truck's parked outside my dorm. I was gonna get three of 'em and watch public freakouts on YouTube. - That sounds wonderful. You know what? Get six and use my card. I'll meet you after. - Now this is college. - This guy bothering you? - Yeah, they got turned off. - They had all summer to fix this thing. What'd you want? - Uh, the fruit snacks. - Here you go. - Wow, that's a pretty great life hack. - Socialism at its best. I'm Russ by the way. - Anna, and I'm Raury. Raury Sanders. - It's nice to meet you, Raury Sanders. - Mm-hmm. - If you wind up wanting a Three Musketeers, I'll be right over there. This thing took like $20 from me last semester so I'm still on house money. - Cool. - Annabella, right? - What? - It's Brooks from the party. - Oh, that's right. Uh, hi. Good to see you again. - You on "Supermarket Sweep"? - Oh no, I'm just buying stuff for my whole family. We're Mormon. - That's very nice of you. Oh, you know, I was hoping I'd run into you. Found out we have a mutual friend. - Really? Who? - Joey Green. - Oh wow, Joey Green. Yes, love him. - Her. - Her, her. - Crazy what happened to her. - The craziest, right? - Yeah, when she called me, I couldn't believe it. - Same. - Tragic. - Yeah, I was shocked to hear that she. - Crashed her car. - Crashed her car. - Into a tree. - Into a tree. It's just, she loves trees. - Are you going to the Chi Theta banquet? I heard you were going. - Uh, I'm not really sure. - Oh, please do. Those things are the worst and I thought maybe we could hide from everyone together. - That's very presumptuous that you think I wanna hide with you. - You've been here like two days, you already have someone else to hide with? - Oh, college moves fast, dude. - Wait, is he who you're shopping for? - Oh, he'll never know. He's already hiding and he's very good at it. - All right. I found the West Fern crest you wanted. Honestly, I didn't even know we had these. You're 18, right? 'Cause it comes with real swords. - Who is Joey Green? - Joey Green sucks. As a kid her family used to vacation with us at the same time in Maui every summer and one year she pooped in the pool. They had to spend five days draining it. Ruined the entire vacation. Now she just posts inspirational quotes every day on Facebook about being Irish. Why? - This guy I meant he says you both know her. - Text me these things, I'll answer fast. - This this nice. You do all these? - Uh, yeah, it's a hobby or whatever. - Wow. These are all actually really good. Why aren't you an art major? - Because I'm next in line to rule the Meat Sleeves's kingdom. You know that. My future isn't up to me. - Isn't that what college is for? To figure out your future. - What do your parents do? - Uh, well my dad died when I was little and my mom is a security guard. She actually worked one of your dad's parties once. She was pretty impressed. - Yeah, he spares no expense on parties, just on parenting. So how's being me? - I can't believe how much free time you have. I mean the fact that you have the day off tomorrow is like mind blowing. - Yeah. Coasting by doesn't get enough credit. - How about you? - Jury is still out. I have not understood a thing in any of your classes, but I'm trying so that's good. - Wait, I have art history tomorrow. You'll love that. - Art history? Do you paint too? - Uh, no, I haven't even picked up a paintbrush before. But I needed an elective. I do watch Bob Ross to go to sleep though. - Well I don't think you'll need Bob tonight after all that shopping. Oh, don't worry, I like when anyone is spending my dad's money. - So I was wondering, I might go to the Chi Theta banquet tomorrow and I need a dress. Do you have anything I could borrow? - Wow, look at you, a sorority function. Not something the real Annabella French would do, but what do I know? I'm just Raury Sanders. Let's see. Too conservative. Too cheugy. Too Grimes. Wait, I like this. What are you doing tonight? - We don't even have fake IDs. What are we doing here? - Dive bars are easy just do what I said. - Um, sir. - Back of the line. - Okay. - Come on, you got this. - So I think we're on Han's list. - Excuse me. - Our names are on Han's List. - What are you guys talking about? Who's Hans? - Full name Han Shake. - Listen, any friend of Hans is a friend of mine. Let's get you ladies at table. Come on. - That was so cringe. - Oh, we are just getting started. The dude was literally like, hey you and you were like ew. - Oh geez, I'm sorry. - No, I love it, you're in savage. - There's a Covered Wagon here. - What's a Covered Wagon? - Oh my god, you've never been a Covered Wagon Buffet? - Uh-uh. - Now it's time for me to teach you some shit. Come on. I am so glad you have the day off. - Well I have class in two hours. - Don't worry, you can ditch. I'll just- - No, no, no, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go. It's, um, it's art history class anyway so it's probably an experience that I will never get to have again. - Today was super fun. Thanks for making me go out. - No, thank you. I have never had a fried turkey dumpling before. So you kind of changed my life. - Did you even know who I was before all this? - Uh, before I became you? - Yeah. - I knew who you were. You were valedictorian and the girl that took her cousin to prom. - Yeah, nailed it. - Yeah, hard to forget. - I mean, we had PE junior year and you acted like you didn't even know I existed. - Did you ever say anything to me? - No. - Well then I guess we have something in common after all. - Oh, there she is. I figured you went for a jog or something, but smells like you've been working in a brewery that serves only blommin' onions. - Is there a, a problem? - Oh yeah, the WiFi's still shot, but our savior here Rudolph from campus IT, says, "It's all tied to your connection." I hope it's okay that I let in. - We were testing speeds in the truck and we realized that your room was the closest to the building signal. It's our best chance at actual diagnostics. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? - No. - Okay, then what is your full name? - It's Annabella French. - Huh, huh, that's the problem. - The, a, a problem? - Yeah, it's just your account it seems to be in a, in a man's name. What's your dad's name? - My dad's name? - Yeah, your dad. What's his name? - Oh, make sure it looks like a tortilla and it spelled H-A-R-R-Y French. Yes, okay? - His name is Harry. - Harry French. Yep, that's what I have here. - Great, well how long until we're back up and running? - I'll get back to you. - Okay, well goodbye. Another man running outta my life. Oh, before I forget, whoop, here is my resume. Just in case you lost the other one. Okay, I'll let you review that. Okay, goodnight. Have a good one. Oh, sorry. Doors. They're always hard for me. Okay. - Wave function collapse. - That is correct, Ms. Sanders. - Okay. Let's see. - I can help you. I know. - How much for these? - How quickly you learn. - I had a good teacher. - There's a rally tomorrow night. We're protesting West Fern taking money from environmentally evil companies. We're talking companies who are single handedly killing off tens of thousands of fish. - Oh man, I'll definitely be there. I'm a big fan of fish. Mm. - That's so great. It means a lot to me. - Sorry. I have to take this, but I'll see you there. - Yeah. - Hi. - Bell, are you free? - Last time I said yes to that question I ended up getting stuck cleaning your hair plugs with a toothbrush so excuse me if I'm overthinking my answer. - So listen, I talked with Dean Cain this morning and he would like you to stop by his office and say hello. Okay, just put a face with the name. - Can't I just call him? - No, no, he needs you to sign something in person. So just swing by. Do me the favor, okay? - Well I'm really super busy today, so I don't- - Thank you. I have to go, sweetheart. I love you. I will let them know you're stopping by. - Why are you wearing that? - I can't be seen with you right now. The block is too hot. - What are you talking about? - You have to go see Dean Cain. - Wait, I do or you do? - You do. - So Annabella or Raury? - Annabella? - Me? - Sort of, but yes. You have to go. - I'm out. - Come on. - Not a chance. - You said that our pictures are swapped in the system anyway so it doesn't even matter. - Says the girl dressed like three kids stacked on top of each other. I had to lie to some my IT guy this morning too. Everyone is gonna catch on. - Everything is gonna be fine. It's already Wednesday. We are more than halfway there. - Annabella, we are done. I have a Meat Sleeve tattoo! Did you know that? My mom's gonna kill me. - 10 Months? - Huh? - You're stuck with it for 10 months. It's ephemeral, it's temporary. - Oh my God, I'm so happy to hear that. Wow. Great, okay. But still I'm not gonna get arrested just so you can live out your weird obsession you have with my life. - Obsession with your life. You're joining a sorority, you're going on shopping sprees. You're basically a real housewife of West Fern. Look at your fancy sunglasses. You've used my last name more than I ever, ever have. - Yes, it's fun having unlimited resources. And we had a great time last night, I'll admit it, but there's no way I'm going in there and lying to Dean Cain's face. - Just be vague and walk out. My dad says, "You just have to sign something." You totally got this. I mean, I even went over your suspicious physics professor. - A professor was suspicious. Oh, that's it, game over. Do you know how much trouble I'll be in if I get caught? - Not as much trouble as credit card fraud. - Excuse me. - You've had no problem using my credit card all week. That's literally a felony. - How dare you. - Raury, we had a deal. Let's just finish this out. - I'll go see the dean, but after Friday I never wanna see you again. - Ow. - Ah, Annabella, I'm so happy you were able to swing by. You know, we have a relatively small student body, but it's rare that I get a chance to meet one-on-one with a student. Particularly a student who is so esteemed. - Ah, well, uh, my dad said, "You wanted to see me and here I am." - You know, I am just so impressed with your father. He's like a real life Scrooge McDuck. Just diving in those coins. Diving in the. You're kidding? You don't know "DuckTales". I Googled it, there was a recent reboot. You gotta know "DuckTales". - Uh, he said, "I needed to sign something." - Oh yeah, just real quick, I'm actually supposed to see your father this weekend. We're gonna discuss a big donation he's making to our cafeteria. He is so generous. - Yeah, I, I bet he is. - And if you could just reassure him that we're in the clear. The FBI totally buying all that foreign hack stuff. - Oh yeah. - It's gonna be fixed by this weekend. You know, I'm really sorry that I just didn't cover my tracks better. I still don't know how I managed to turn the power off to the entire school, but I did. But anyway, we're all good now. - Well, I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that. - Ah, found it. - Ah, great. - This is now the only evidence of your admission. I'm going to replace the old one when the system relaunches. And it's not gonna say anything about the fencing team. - Fencing team? - Yeah, it'll look like you tried it out and you know it didn't get in. Something like that. Here. Thank you. Signed, sealed, and delivered. And if you could apologize to your father for any stress that I may have caused. And Annabella, if you need anything, anything at all, you know, I basically sleep in this office. Actually, I do sleep in this office. I sleep right there. Just until January when the mediation starts. - Thank you. - Thanks, Annabella. Bye-bye. - Ladies night. You two got any plans? Wanna hang out? I've got some limited edition Oreos. No pressure. They don't expire for like six months. Whoa, mama. Someone going to the Met Gala. What's her problem? Oh, before I forget. Got this for you. - I, I got it, Eggs. - Great, I'll just keep this one. Okay, okay. - Thank you so much. It really means a lot. Your support is all we have. Hey, I'm so happy you came. - I wouldn't miss this for the world. - We're waiting on a few more people to show up and then we'll head over to Chi Theta. - Chi Theta? - Yeah, yeah, there's a, there's a big banquet there tonight. And well, I figured West Fern has to listen if we take it to their beloved little sorority girls. - I think that's a really great idea. - Let's go. All right, make sure you guys have a sign. We've come here tonight to make Dean Cain and West Fern accountable for their actions. - Yeah. - The special interest groups that line the pockets of our administration has done enough damage to our planet and our college. - Yeah. - The time for action is now. The blood is on their hands. - Yeah. - The blood is on their hands! - The blood is on their hands! The blood is on their hands, the blood is on their hands! The blood is on their hands! - Tell 'em they're like real swords. - Yeah, but like very little swords. - Is that crest on your wall now? - Oh, yeah, I'm in too deep. I had to hang it up. I mean, when I saw it on the website, I thought it was like a paperweight. I didn't think it was gonna weigh 50 pounds. - Well, I think that thing makes you the dragon queen. - Ugh. It's already very embarrassing that you saw me at my lowest point. - All right, we're out. - This banquet's not over yet. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. I don't get it, how are you guys in a fraternity? Seem to. - What's smart? - Yeah. - I get it. But honestly, not everybody joins a frat to party. I'm the philanthropy chair. It's the only place where I can get a budget to locally make a difference. - Who got the juice? - But yeah, don't get me wrong, I'm surrounded by idiots. - They're harmless. - Well, I hope you end up joining Theta. They're our sister sorority, so that means we'd be spending a lot of time together. I mean, you already know what it's like to have a bunch of brothers and sisters. - What? - You know, being Mormon and all. - Oh yes. I am a hundred percent Mormon. Yeah, definitely Mormon. Yeah, thank you for remembering that. I mean- - Guys, um, I was just informed that there is someone at this party that has less than 4,000 followers on Instagram. And I'm not trying to shame anyone, um, but please leave. Thank you. - Can we please get outta here? - Oh, absolutely. - Save our oceans! - Save our oceans! - Save our oceans! - Save our oceans! - Make them pay! - Make them pay! - Make them pay! - Make them pay! - We want justice! - We want- - You doing anything tomorrow? - Uh, no, it's actually my last day before things get really busy again so I'm free. - Well, we're doing a big brother event down at Keeler Elementary and we could use some help if you're down. - Sounds good for sure. - And dinner with me afterwards. - Hmm, nah, I'm sorry, I have to clean my crest. It' takes six to seven hours, okay? - Yeah, it doesn't surprise me. - You ever have imposter syndrome? - What's that? - The feeling that you don't truly deserve to be somewhere, like a fraud. And if people find out the truth they'll hate you. - Not really. Honestly, I sort of feel the opposite. I think I know what I'm doing and everybody else is the fraud. Does that make me a psychopath? - No, makes you a white boy. - Down with West Fern! - Down with West Fern! - Down with West Fern! - Down with West Fern! - Save our oceans! - Save our oceans! - What is this? - We've come here tonight in front of our school's most elite club of the 1%, without any response from Dean Cain and his deep pockets. We want answers and we want them now! - Yeah! - We want our school to reject the blood money that pollutes our oceans and wildlife. - Who are these poor people? - We care about our environment while trust fund babies like you, turn a blind eye. And with that in mind, these are the names of the worst offenders here at West Fern. These companies and their donations have directly resulted in the death of fish, whales, sharks, and the most innocent creatures of the animal kingdom, seahorses. We love seahorses! - We love seahorses! We love seahorses! - Plexico Oil! - Boo! - Discount Foods International. - Boo! - Bubble Zing Energy Drink! - Boo! - And the evil empire of Meat Sleeves! - Boo! - Yeah! - Down with West Fern! - Down with West Fern! - Down with West Fern! - Down with West Fern! - Down with West Fern - Down with West Fern! - Down with West Fern! - Down with West Fern! - This is all your fault, you idiot! - Me, it's not my fault that your new friends are clubbing baby seals. - Shit, come on. What the hell were you doing? - I was saving you. - When did you become Greta Thunberg? - Probably around the same time that you thought it would be a good idea to make out with some random frat boy while pretending to be me. Which by the way seems highly problematic. - Well, I'm sorry. I know it's hard for you to see anybody do something their daddy didn't tell them to do. - You know what? At least I know who I am. You on the other hand have zero clue. Ironically, you pretend to hate my dad, the rich asshole, but actually you wanna be him so badly. - I do not wanna be your dad. You think I wanna cheat to get my kid into college? - What? - Fencing really? - What are you talking about? - Don't act dumb. You stole someone's spot! Someone was rejected because of you. - Fencing. Oh wow. - We're staying in this room until we get an email response back from the school. They should be responding any moment. - Not if I didn't send it. - You didn't send the email. - Raury, hold on. - You liar. - This is the first time in my life where I've had some control. I can actually be an artist. - This has nothing to do with me, Annabella. - Yes it does, Raury. - This is so messed up. I mean, you're insane. - Okay, I, I will, I will pay for next semester too. I will pay for all four years of college. - Oh no, you're not used to hearing this, but you cannot pay your way out of this! - I will set you up with the most amazing Meat Sleeves's position after graduation. I'll take care of it all and then you'll be set for life, okay? - No, I'm sending the email now. - No, no, Raury, hold on. - Annabella, move! - Let's talk about this. - Get out of my way! - I'm so much stronger than you! - Annabella French? - Yes. - Now tell me what the hell is going on? - Well, she asked me- - When I got into this school my dad was like- - Right, but I didn't wanna. - Shut up! I'm gonna make this very easy for you. Are you Annabella French? - I'm Raury Sanders. - I'm actually Annabella French. - Right. Kill her. - Wait, what, what are you talking about? - Kill her? - He hasn't paid so you die. - Who didn't pay you? Why, why are you going to kill me? - Everybody just calm down. I mean, we can talk this out. - Her owes me 120,000 bucks so now I take action. - Please, please don't kill me. My dad will give you whatever you want. - Yeah. - 120 that's nothing. I mean, he has that. - Not a chance. - No, he don't. Your father is broke. - That's not possible. - Yeah, I, I mean she has at least $35,000 in her student account. I mean the, the, the cars, the houses, I mean, I'm pretty sure you guys have a boat. He's a millionaire. - Her dad's been living off a debt and corporate crime for like a decade. Every dollar he has is owed or stolen. He's a pyramid scheme Netflix documentary just waiting to happen. He's as much of a fraud as you are. Just get it done. And don't kill her on campus. - No, no, no, guys, you don't have to do this. - I'm going to die. I can't believe I'm going to die. - No, Annabella! Annabella! No! - Let's go! - Those were real. - Where did you park my car? - Oh, I think over there. - You think? - I'm sorry. I didn't think we'd be running for our lives. - Great, okay, where is it? - Oh, oh, right there. There it is. Do you see them? - You need to wash the road. - No shit, John Wick. I think you slowed them down 'cause you shanked them. I can't believe this. - We need a plan. We can never go back to the dorms. I've listened to enough true crime podcasts to know this ends poorly. How far is Mexico? - Shut up! My God how much worse could you possibly make this? - This isn't my fault, you heard them. - We need to go to the cops. - And say what? That we switched to identities and now gangsters are trying to kill me because my dad's a scammer. - Yes, Annabella that's exactly what we say. Literally word for word. Oh, and also add the fact that you're trying to use me human blackmail! - I'm so dead. Eventually they are going to find me and. Did you just throw the keys? - Yes! - Run! Are we still on campus? - Why did I throw the keys? - I don't know why. - Get down there! - Now it works. Go! Kick! - How did you do that? - Physics. - Split up. Find them! I hate puppets. Ah! You idiots, find me those two girls before I killed them myself! I hate goddamn puppets! - They're going to kill us! - I know that, Annabella! - Do you think my dad's actually broke? - What, I don't see why that's very important right now! - It's just that when I actually think about it, it makes total sense. I mean, Meat Sleeves taste like sweaty headbands and he was always flying in these sketchy foreign investors. - Why are we talking about this? We are literally running for our lives. I bet they're right behind us. - This one time you bought my mom a race horse and he said, "That she could only keep it if the Celtics won by four and a half points." - Please stop talking. - So much of my identity has been wrapped up in being rich. I mean, it's the only reason why people like me. - That's not true. You're fun, you're nice, and you mean well. And as for yourself when you mind your mind to something you can do anything. - That's actually really nice of you to say. - I can't believe I'm feeling bad for you. There's no service. Dean Cain! Where are you? - Open up! Open up, open up! - Ooh, I have bars. - Okay, call 911. - The police? - Yes, we don't have any other choice. Just do it. - Okay. - Oh, come on on! - Wait, wait, I have an idea. Okay, okay. - Ah, oh, thank God- - Hello. you're not those protesters. - Hello. - What is the matter, Ms. French? - She's Ms. French. I'm Raury Sanders. There's killers after us! Just please let us in. - She's right, everything she's saying is right. Please just help us. - Girls look, just slow down. Let me help you before we do anything though, do you know what "DuckTales" is? - What? - Really? - She didn't know what "DuckTales" was. I think that's weird. - I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. - Are you serious? What is the matter with your generation? You're all obsessed with the "Goofy Movie". It's really not as good as you think it is. - We want the French girl, Dean. - Oh gosh, what's going on, Annabella? - It's actually her. She's Annabella French. - Wait, you're Annabella French? - Yes, that is what we have been saying. - And they wanna kill you? - My dad owes the money. He's apparently bankrupt or something. - Your dad is broke? - Yes, I guess so. - Hurry up or else I'll have to kill all three of you. - Okay. - Oh my god. - Okay, yeah, we gotta hand you over. - Are you serious right now? - Yeah, it's our only choice. - He's trying to kill me. What are you saying? - I'm sorry but I'm an administrator, I'm trained in risk assessment. There's only one of you, three of us shouldn't die. They're asking asking for you, you should take the fall. And now that I know that your father is broke, it's unfortunate, but it's the only way out. - What is wrong with you? - You have until three. - One- - Stop counting. You can have her. - No! - Annabella, you called me. Thank God when I took your phone, I made it so I could track you 24/7. So where to? I got room in the back. - I got lucky, I followed someone in. They were not wrong about the strawberry tea. - Now don't think I haven't had one of these every day for the past four weeks. School is so nervous I'm gonna sue, they give me a ton of meal credits and VIP access. So how was your first week? - It was fine. Community college is just more my speed and it's technically where I should have been in the first place so. - And you're an art major. - With a physics minor. I somehow am a natural. - So how's your dad doing? - Oh, you didn't hear? He sold his life rights. - He did? - Yeah. - And look who they got to play him in the movie. - Oh, it really is a small world. - Um, everything of my dad's got repossessed. There's tax fraud, credit fraud, and fraud fraud. So I've been living with my mom, which is actually kind of nice. - Good. How are you though? - You know, I was always uncomfortable with being rich so finding out that we weren't actually rich was kind of a relief. The attention sucks. But when everybody found out that I didn't know anything about the fencing stuff, it got a lot easier. Plus someone more deserving got my spot here, so that was good. - Good. - How's being Raury again? - Stressful. That economics class is like way harder than I thought. - I told you. - Yeah, it sucks. And Brooks and I went on a date last week. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. But I think we're just friends. I mean, I don't time between waiting tables and tutoring. I think I'm gonna cherish as much alone time as I can get. How are you and Russ? - Oh, it's coming along. When everything came out, he was actually super supportive. I think it turns him on that I'm rebelling against privilege. Oh, thanks for the recommendation by the way. - You know you didn't have to take all the blame with school, and the cops, and the credit card company. You really painted me to be a victim, which isn't completely true. - The whole thing was my idea period. I was an idiot. Plus I've never had any real financial responsibility before so having to pay the whole thing off is actually kind of helping me in a weird way. - Well, I'm considering this whole experience to be a positive thing 'cause I made a new friend and that new friend is pretty good with swords. - Sais. Going to China with my dad on business trips finally paid off. Oh I, I painted you something. - Annabella. I love this. - It's nothing. - No, it's something. Thank you. - Please hang it next to the crest. - Oh, you got it. - Okay. All right, should we go to this party? I'm starving. Should I wear this hat to the part? - Yes, I do have friends after all. And they were all here. Okay Mom, I have to use the bathroom. I'll call you back. I'm so sorry.
