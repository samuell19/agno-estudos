Helen! No pictures, please! Scissors. Scalpel. Clamps. Take one of these pills whenever you feel upset. And try to avoid strong emotional stress. I mean it. Your nervous system has to recover. And above all, forget about the races. Is that clear? I understand. No smoking, no lovemaking, no whiskey, just a nice walk in the country. I can allow you one exception. Which one will it be? - Whiskey. - All right, but never on an empty stomach. Helen! I couldn't wait to take you back home. Did you pay the clinic bill? With what? You're overdrawn. And the car? Totally destroyed. The manufacturer wants 6 million lira. - Madam? - Yes? - It's for you. - Thank you. Aren't you gonna read it? Probably just a 'get well' telegram. Look at it yourself. 'I have a villa in Majorca and I really want to see you again. A little rest by the sea will do you good. Come. Don't play stupid.' Sounds nice. Who sent it? A certain Maurice. - A friend? - Not exactly. My ex-husband. We divorced 3 years ago. You sound like he left you. He did. I haven't seen him since. Will you go? I have no intention of seeing him again. It's past history. Forbidden by the doctor. And this? Also forbidden. We'll try to ease abstinence. I'll be right back. Helen! Do you know where the villa of Maurice Sauvage is? No. You said Maurice? - A brown-haired guy? - Yes. A very sexy body? Yes. His villa is up there. Is someone home? Maurice? You're Helen, right? - Well, I... - Welcome. Make yourself at home. You're looking for Maurice? - Yes, but... - I'm Constance, his wife. I didn't know that he remarried. Maurice has a vocation for marriage. He married me right after your divorce. He's by the swimming pool. We were to meet some friends in Palma. You did well not to warn us. He loves surprises. But you know him better than I do. Where's your luggage? I didn't take any. I left unexpectedly. Don't worry. Who needs clothes by the sea anyway? I don't know why Maurice invited me. Maybe I'd better leave. Even for you. Don't be silly. I'm delighted to have you here. - Can we use first names? - Sure. Helen! I wasn't expecting you. You look great. So do you. - Let me look at you. - You're embarrassing me. I expected more emotions. You look like old acquaintances. The good side of marriage. When it's over, you become friends. Right, Helen? Sure. Harry, will you stop with that spying machine of yours? This is Doctor Webb. - How do you do? - Delighted. Hey, Maurice! Albert! So you're here finally. - Get down, you have to meet our guest. - I'm coming! My husband'd love to live in these caves. He finds them 'cinematographic'. Come on, Solange. I like to document on new events and your arrival is one. Really? But you look very well. The newspapers said you were in a bad shape. Journalists often exaggerate. Especially when they talk about us. Palma's the best place for you to rest. - I hope so. - Let's begin! - Whiskey? - Yes, please. It's rather humid here. Oh, I can't drink on an empty stomach. Your wife's very nice. Oh, I'm sorry. With all of Maurice's women, a little confusion is normal. One day one of them will get jealous and will kill you. One already tried. But I'm invulnerable. I bet it was you. You're a fortune-teller now? I'll buy you a turban. His robe is enough. Our Duchamps is a judge in charge of criminal cases. Of course, you have the flair of a bloodhound. Are you always that shrewd? You'll see for yourself. You will stay, won't you? Of course she will. The two of us must become friends. Thank you. I know you can't sleep without one of those. You remember that? I wanted to welcome you alone. Disappointed because there's Constance? Not at all. You're still conceited. Did you expect me to be jealous? You don't interest me that way anymore. Otherwise I wouldn't be here. All right. What do you think of my wife? Charming, don't you think? Hmm. And rich I suppose. Yes, very rich. Of course, you... were different. More important. If you invited me to heal your nostalgia by getting me into bed, you got things wrong. Where did you get that from? And I didn't invite you. Constance did. - Constance? - Yes. She was the one who wanted you here. Excuse me. A gift from Constance since you didn't bring anything. How nice. Shall I hang them up Madam? Yes, please. - Dinner's at nine. - All right. Our guest first. Thank you. It was very nice of you for the clothes. They fit perfectly. Maurice remembered your measurements. 'Who has a short memory has a short life.' You managed to embarrass her. Did I or did you? Sometimes I wonder what your aim in life is. To make myself happy. And to put your money to good use. Was he that cynical with you too? I only cared about how well he made love. I had only met frigid Americans before him. Well enough to overcome any kind of frigidity, right? The truth is you're unsure of yourself. You feel flattered, that's all. Should I try to be different? No, why? You're a typical European male: selfish, amoral and corrupt. Who couldn't care less about our puritanism. Puritans are the best in bed. A long-distance call for you. I think it's your daughter. Excuse me for a moment. Yes? Is that you Susan? You wouldn't think she had a daughter. It's an error of her youth. She keeps her in a school in Zurich. She inherited Susan from her first husband along with some oil wells. You call that an error? I absolutely forbid it Susan. No, I don't want to. What you're doing is wicked. You must break it off at once. You must leave him, understand? Yes, yes. Let's stop now. I'll come and see you one of these days. She has a sharp tongue. Does she treat you that way? We're very fond of each other. We're like one person. Is that why she signed her telegram with your name? I sign her checks with mine. Stop it, Susan. Stop it. We'll talk about it in person. Sorry but my daughter often exasperates me. What a fuss for a childish love affair. You always dramatise. You're the last person on Earth to judge a young girl's morality. All right, we Europeans are corrupted. Are you looking for me? Indeed I was. Let's see if I can guess. You found out I was the one who sent the telegram and you want to know why. Exactly. Why? Will you help me? I have something for you. 6 millions for the car you smashed and the clinic bill, 3.5 million. I paid through my bank. Why did you do that? Why don't you mind your own business? I want an explanation. 3 years ago, Maurice left you having spent your last cents. So you worked for a magazine, then a boutique, then you did public relations and eventually you took up racing. You know a lot about me. Racing only brought you enough to live on. You and the various playboys you took to bed. So you want to buy me too. 'Cause you can afford everything. Don't feel you owe me anything, we must help each other. We're almost relatives. We married the same man. The same playboy. Yes. And for the same reason. He's a vice. A sort of drug. We have no defence against Maurice. Against his cynicism. His way of making love. His overbearing manners. Or maybe there is a defence. You must help me, Helen. I don't have this kind of inclination. Me neither. Hey, let's have a swim. Duchamps's waiting for us. You go. I'm a bit tired. I'll see you later. What's happened to her? Maurice, what's wrong? Calm down. It's nothing serious. Let's bring him inside. This way. Slowly. - What happened? - We were saying goodbye to Albert and he fainted. Probably a sun stroke. Have you got any cardiotonic medicine? - I think so. - Go get it now. Looks like a heart failure. I'll go get Dr Webb. I'll be right back. It fell. It was the only one. Don't worry. I don't think we need it anymore. Maurice, how do you feel? Any better? Yes, I'm fine. We were so worried. That phial didn't fall accidentally, did it? I can't take it anymore. He will leave me too. He's waiting for a richer woman. He's tired already, intolerant and unfaithful. And I can't stand it. I can't. First he makes you fall in love and then he uses you like an object. And you start thinking about his death as a liberation. You tried 3 years ago. I'll give you $100,000, Helen. In exchange for what? For your help. I can't do it on my own. And you'd like to get rid of him too. You want me to help you kill him? I'll stay with my daughter till tomorrow. Think about it. You'll tell me your answer when I'm back. You're leaving? Yes. I decided to enter a rally in Barcelona. What's the matter with you? So suddenly. Without a word of warning. Constance will feel bad. Tell her I'm sorry when she gets back. And you won't tell me you're sorry? I want to go. Let go of the door. The carburettor isn't getting gasoline. Maybe you lost a part. Today's Saturday. Everything's closed. You'll have to wait till Monday. Constance's not here. Let's enjoy. We could stay together. Like good old times. What do you say? I say no. "I know you're hungry but don't eat the pigeon." "Come eat dinner with me." Great loves are protected by chance. And you're planning on helping chance out? My little trick amused you. Admit it. Turn it off. Music makes me nervous when I drive. Happy? Keep tight, darling. Don't worry about me. You're the one sitting on the death seat. Watch out for that bend! Slow down! A trick I learned as a child. I was so wrong, Helen. But I want to make it up to you. You know, before leaving, I want to make love to you one more time. - Whore. - I know. It's late. Don't forget you must leave for this rally. I don't care about the rally. And my doctors forbade me to race. You know, Maurice, I think I can remember every night we spent together. Every time we made love. You remember when we were in Capri? The same sea, the same silence. Yes. I think it was the same champagne. The same one: 'Cordon Bleu', 1954. You're too sure of yourself, but that's your weakness. Wrong, you're my weakness. Constance comes here too, doesn't she? Yes, for hunting sometimes. It's ideal for a certain kind of hunting. You should be careful. A woman in love can do anything. What are you worrying about? Constance is a modern woman. She's learnt a lot. She invited you, right? That's exactly what she wants. You haven't changed. What do you expect me to do? To divorce Constance and remarry you? I love being with you but I can't do without Constance. You have no money, she's very rich. She has enough to support both of us. All three of us, actually. Don't you agree? - Don't be stupid! - Let me go! Enough! Let me go, I said! - Wait! - No! Welcome home. I was with him all night. And I wanted it. I know. That gives you another reason to kill him. I don't need another reason. Do you? I can't avoid Maurice. As long as he's alive. When? - Hey Albert! - Hi, vampire! Where are the others? - Harry! - Solange, wait! These youths are a shame! Good, Solange, go on! Come closer. Yes, like this. - Hi. - Hi Duchamps! - Hi Sam! Maurice is very keen on sports. He plays golf. The least he can do playing golf is dislocate his shoulder. A horse. Yes, he could fall off a horse, but how do we bribe the horse? He goes underwater fishing. That's more like it. The important thing is that it looks like an accident. And that I could be there to witness it. Your two wives became friends. I wonder what they are talking about. Women are sometimes silent but never when there's nothing to say. It could go off when he's loading it. Of course. What kind of a underwater rifle does he use? Compressed air. But who knows if it'll be powerful enough? Not 'powerful enough'. Very powerful. You're referring to me? Of course. In a bad way I hope. Less than he deserves it. He still hasn't entertained Helen. I can do something about that. That would be great. Why don't we go for a trip with your boat? There's my boat too. Don't bother him. You have a boat, Maurice? Yes, I have. We can go tomorrow if you want. Tomorrow then. All right Helen? Helen! What are you doing at this time of night? I thought you already were in bed. I'm practicing for the fishing. You'll need a very big fish for this rifle. Big like you are for instance. It's a present for you, silly. Do you like it? Does it mean I'm forgiven? It means I don't care anymore. Perfect day for fishing. What do you think? It's great. Let's stop here. Maybe we'll find something. - You take it? - Sure. Keep it against the wind, like this. All right. Let me take it. Shoot him! What are you waiting for? Shoot him, you idiot! Shoot him! - What are you waiting for? Give it to me! - No! I don't want to! - Give it to me! - No! Don't panic. Take the tiller and keep it steady. Hey Maurice! - Hey, it's us! - Hey Constance! Can you hear us? Maurice! Hello Albert! - Hi Helen! - We're coming! Careful now! Maurice! - Quick! - Help! Where are you, Constance? Help! Constance! Where are you? Get the rope, Helen! - Quick! - Constance went down! I saw her! Save her, please! Constance! Find my wife! - Calm down, Helen! We'll find her! - It was horrible! Horrible! Save her! Why didn't the manoeuvre succeed? I don't know. Maybe a gust of wind. Or I veered too fast. Unfortunately this is a necessary formality Maurice. May I go on? Yes, sure. Why did you turn that way? I mean, so sharply? Well... We wanted to meet Duchamps who was arriving. I can confirm that. Yes, officer. It's true. The accident happened in front of our very eyes. Did you find something? Nothing Sir. What do you say Captain? It already happened even on a calm sea. And how's that? It's a question of stability, because of the wind. How about it? A boat can capsize when the right forces combine. I told you it's not the first time. I understand. Very unfortunate. Where did the poor woman sit? I'm sorry, I'm exhausted. Hold on Helen. Soon it will be over. So? She sat there. Look, here. Just here, when the boat lifted on my side... Constance fell on me. It happened so fast. I saw the boom coming at me. Next thing I know, I was in the water. I think she was around here when the boom hit me. Just a moment. Do you think your wife was struck by the boom? Maybe. It's the only explanation I can think of. I can still see poor Constance. She waved and... It's enough for my record. Now I need their signatures. Do you want to read it again? I think we can close the case, Judge. No. We have to find the body. And we'll do everything we can, Maurice. Thank you, Albert. But we shouldn't look where the boat overturned. Why? There are some cold currents going to the open sea, to the West. That's where you should look. That's not true Sir. What? The currents go North West, thus they are warm, not cold. And according to the weather conditions... I understand. Thank you. You helped us a lot. Can you please excuse me? Can you come with me, Albert? I haven't seen my husband all day. But I'm afraid he's heard the news by now. Helen, be strong. Good night. See you tomorrow Maurice. Helen! Helen! Get out! I want to be alone! You tried to kill me! Why? I can understand Constance, but you? Did you ask yourself 3 years ago when I tried to shoot you? The answer's the same! Nothing has changed! You're wrong. Because now she's gone. I only cared about her money. And it's all mine now. We're free. It had to happen. - Do you understand it? - Yes, yes... Hey everybody! Mom! Maurice! - Miss... - Hi Miguel! We called the school many times. I was on a school trip. I took advantage of it to come and say hello. Miss Susan! Wait. They haven't come down yet. I should call them. No, don't. I'll go to wake them up myself. Hey! Are you here? Mom? Maurice? Where are you hiding? Hey, people! Constance? I'm Susan. Are you a guest? Well, not really. I'm a friend. - Do you know where my mother is? - Your mother... - Did something happen? Where is Maurice? - Nothing... I don't know. Maybe he's at the swimming pool. I'll get dressed and go get him. He'll explain it to you. - But... - Excuse me. What happened? Miss... Be strong. It wasn't easy but it's done. And now? She'll get over it, you'll see. She's young. Careful, there's Miguel. Get a hold of yourself. I hadn't thought of Susan until I saw her. So young, so defenceless. Light it with this. I hope you like it. I bought it for you. No regrets. You promise me? I promise, dear. Miguel! Enjoy your holidays. I can stay longer, especially now that Miss Susan is here. Don't bother. Susan will give me a hand. This is for you. Goobye then. See you next month. As you wish. Goodbye. My mother could swim very well. Even better than Helen I'm sure. I already explained it to you. She was struck by the boom when the boat capsized. Do you two still get on well? We remained friends. I'd like to know what you still feel for each other. There's nothing wrong with you two being in love. I don't understand why you try to hide it. We don't have anything to hide. And that's none of your business anyway. On the contrary, I think it is. Especially now that you are here instead of my mother. Susan, you're being rude. My mother was the polite one, since she disappeared at the right moment. Such a coincidence, right? I can understand you're upset. But you're not the only one suffering from Constance's death. Think about it next time before you hurt anyone. You'll make it all worse with this. You felt it too. She knows something. She does. No and she won't. If we don't betray ourselves. Forgive me. Just wait a few days. Just time to settle the estate. Then I'll send her back to school. Good girl. - May I? - Come in Albert. Hi. Any news? Well... Not really good ones. According to the experts, the body must have been drifted far from the bay. I did my best Maurice, but now... I have to close the case. I understand. I think it's useless to go on searching. Who knows where the current took her. Who knows... Maybe it is still where the accident took place. Don't you think Mr Duchamps? It just might be, Susan. But the water on this spot is deep and full of seaweed. Then I ask you to try one more time. Please do. If it's possible. All right. Tomorrow I'll send the divers over there. Till then, I'll take a look there myself. I'd like to come with you if you don't mind. There's something very important I have to do. Hey there, you on the motorboat! Beware! Why? You're near our net. It is stuck. It snagged on something. We have to haul it in. Slowly, slowly. It's heavy. I can't look. Be strong Susan. Everybody now pull up. Try to be strong. You have to. - I can't! - You must! It's seaweed. It's all right. See, it's only seaweed on a log. Don't break the net. It's horrid. Don't look for it anymore! Please don't! Don't! All right, as you wish. The matter's closed. Calm down. Let's go back. She'll never come afloat with that weight on her feet. But we have to beware not to make any mistake. It's torture. I can't take anymore. I'm going back to Rome. You can join me there if you want. You'll give them more reasons to suspect us... Look at my hands... I can't control myself. - You must resist. - I can't. We have to keep our heads. I'm afraid Maurice... So afraid... Don't be. I'm with you. Who's that? It's you Maurice. What are you doing here, Jacques? Dr Webb called me. He forgot his camera. He left it here? The other day. He was filming your boat down there. When the accident happened? Yes, he saw everything. Poor woman. What a shame. Did you film the whole accident? No, only a part. I was so upset I left everything. Why didn't you tell me? Well, I thought you wouldn't be interested. It's the last record of Constance. I'd like to see it. Do you have it here? It's being developed in London. London? How long will it take? Enough for today. I had my pigeon. I asked you how long... Hey Dr Webb! Look at me now! You did well to bring Solange here. She needs to go out. Poor child. What's wrong? It distressed me. Killing pigeons frees us from our unconscious aggressiveness. Instead of killing people. Exactly. Without this, we'll all end up in jail. The perfect crime. It doesn't exist. Only diseases kill with impunity. Or doctors. Or clever ones. I thought of a plot for a murder story. A man and woman once married to each other meet again and fall back in love. But the man is remarried so they kill the wife and pretend it's an accident. But a friend of the couple, a magistrate, gets suspicious, investigates and discovers the crime. This isn't a crime novel, reality is quite different. Let's see if you can commit a crime. Shoot! This girl is really something. When do you say the film will be ready? Within a few days. If the post doesn't mess up. Do you have a package from London for Dr Webb? No, Madam. I already asked for it, Helen. Nothing arrived yet. You're very interested by this film. Why is that? Because I'm most anxious to see it. Bye, dear. Registered letter. - Here you are. - Thank you. Pair of aces! Good! If you want to join her, I don't mind. She only came to check up on me. You're not a woman so it's fine. Is Helen jealous? You know how women are if you were married to them. They never forget. Three queens. Constance! God! What's wrong? How did you get that idea? Sorry for the intrusion but I wanted some whiskey. There's always plenty in here. Did the clothes disturb you? Do you want some too? You look like you need some. No! Anything that reminds you of my mother upsets you. What did you do to her? What happened? Your Helen's having a breakdown! If I were you, I'd take care of it. Enough! Shut up you idiot! Go back to your room! Is it this one? Yes it is. I'll bring it to the doctor myself. Sign here please. Here it is. But there still remains the negative. There's no negative. It's reversible film. Is there something? - I can't see anything. We'll watch it at home with the projector. - Yes. Hey there! Great day, huh! It's here. We were around. So we picked it up for you. You did well. If you want, we can watch it together. Yes, sure. Come and see us later on. All right. Damn! What do we do now? Don't worry. If there's anything on that film, nobody will know. Did you tell anyone you were here? No. My wife is away for the weekend. Are we on time? Susan told me. Fine. Come in. But I don't think Susan should see it. I told her so but she insisted. You can't forbid me to see it. You don't have the right to. There it is. Watch! Helen! - I'm sorry... I can't... I can't take it. - Calm down, come with me. No, you stay with them. Forgive me, please, forgive me! Well... The film was finished anyway. Maurice! Maurice? - Yes? - Hi, it's Webb. How's Helen? - Is she feeling better? - Yes, she's resting. When you picked up the film at the post office, did you see any other bits by any chance? Why? It finished abruptly. You saw that yourself. As if something was missing. Maybe a part is still in London. - You can send for it. - Sure. - Goodbye then. - Bye. Why did you lock yourself? Because of people like you. Who come in without knocking. What do you want? I want you. No... Helen! Wait! Let me explain! There's nothing to explain! I understand everything now! Susan and you had an affair, didn't you? Constance found out and that's why she wanted to kill you! She knew you were her daughter's lover! I'm fed up with your depravities! I'm leaving! I'm leaving! - Listen to me! - You make me sick! Fine but listen to me! It's over with Susan! It's true. But since she came back, she's thrown herself at me. Let go of me! Let go! I don't care anymore! Get a grip! What else could I do? Not sleeping with her! She suspected us. You saw that. I swear it was the only reason! Do you realise what we're risking? By sleeping with her, I made her stop thinking we killed her mother! You understand that, do you? Please, leave me alone! I had to keep her quiet. By going to bed with her! I'll never forgive you for this! Where do you think you're going? At this time? Dressed like this? Wait till tomorrow. Tomorrow morning, we'll send Susan back to school. And we'll move to the tower. Get some rest. Don't think about it. Everything will be fine. You'll see. Trust me. Good night. Good move, isn't it? What's wrong? You're preoccupied? I'm fed up with all this. - Helen? - Yes, she's jealous. Maybe she wants to marry you again. Check. Once was enough. You don't know her. She's sick. She worries me. It's true she's been excited and tense since she's been here. As if she was obsessed with something. Maybe she wants to try to kill you again? No need to joke about it! No, Albert. I'd like to make her see reason, to try to calm her down. But then off she goes. Tomorrow I'll take her to the tower for some hunting, some walking. - Why don't you join us? - As a peacemaker? No, but I would feel more secure. As you wish. I'll come up at 10 o'clock. Are you really afraid of something? No, I just feel a bit low tonight. I've got your queen. Maurice? Where are you going? I decided to go back to Rome. And where is Maurice? I don't know. At the tower I think. Albert, what happened? That's what I want to know. Get out. Come on. Admit it. You were at the tower this morning. No, I didn't go there. Maurice waited for you there. I don't know. You had an appointment with him. Don't deny it. Maurice told it to me yesterday night. I had no intention of going there with him. I was leaving. Leaving this way, without saying goodbye to anyone? Why all these questions? You know very well why. You killed Maurice. Maurice is dead? God. You, come here. Hurry. What happened yesterday night? Nothing. You'd better tell me the truth, Susan. Maurice and her had a quarrel. I already know that. It's not enough. I want to know the cause of this quarrel. Helen was jealous of me. Did she have any reason to be? If I were her, I would. - How would I know? - Try to explain it better. If I had found Maurice in bed with someone, I'd be jealous too. You mean she found you two in bed? I was curious to check what would happen. I had an argument with Maurice, but not because I was jealous. What he was doing with Susan... was monstrous. I had to say something. Monstrous enough to kill him? I saw you with my very eyes leaving the tower! No! I didn't go there! I didn't kill him! I swear! I stayed here! Is it true? I don't like working with the police. Would you rather go to a reformatory? I went to her room to say goodbye. I have to go back to school. But I didn't find her. That's not true! She's inventing things because she hates me. And why would she hate you? Are you looking for this lighter? I found it in the tower. It didn't go there by itself. Tell me what you did with the body. After you shot him, Maurice crawled outside, right? And then you finished him off! No, no! Don't worry, we'll find him! Judge, no trace of the body around the tower. We have to look everywhere. We called the scientific police. Are you coming with us? Yes, I'll be right there. You don't leave the villa. Later on, we'll go to the tower and you'll tell me everything. If you were such a sucker, imagine Duchamps. I don't need this anymore. Here it is. This morning, I went to the tower to find Maurice. Do you understand now? I killed Maurice. But Duchamps saw you leaving the tower in a fury in your car. And there he found your lighter. Why? I was 15 when Maurice slept with me for the first time. Then he married my mother but I could stand it. But then you came. And you killed her. You hoped to run free, right? Maurice pleased me a lot but not as much as when I saw him die. And I'll tell you, in this country, you'll get sentenced to death for murder! Stop it! I'll send you a postcard from school! In jail! Yes? - Excuse me, Sir. - Yes? Telephone. I think it's for you. This way. Yes? Who is it? Hello? Hello? I can't hear anything. Who is it? Hello? I can't hear you! Operator please, check the line. Hello? Hello? Here. She just left. Yes, with the car. All right. Yes. I understand. Judge! She just managed to escape! Mr Duchamps! Come here, quick! Hello? Hello. - Is that you Albert? - Maurice! I called your office. They say you were at the villa. Are you ok? Where are you? Webb's office. I had an accident cleaning my rifle. So it wasn't Helen? Helen? No I haven't seen her. I thought she shot you, that she killed you. - What? - Yes... Everything led me to believe it. She left a couple of minutes ago with the car. I questioned her. But she didn't do anything! And you accuse her of murder! You're crazy, Albert! I know her condition! I have to stop her. - I'm taking your car. - Of course. In this case, I'll cooperate with the police. - Judge... - No, Susan. He was doing his job. Let's file the report. Right. It worked. You were great my dear. And I had fun, too. Poor Duchamps, he thinks he killed her. Now we're out of trouble. She would have kept me tied with blackmail for all my life. You didn't have any choice. And if you hadn't got rid of them, I'd have got rid of you. Hey inspector! Inspector, can you hear me? They're looking for the body of... Stop! Come back! There's no need anymore. We found her! Can you hear me? We found the body! The body of a woman! Of a woman!
