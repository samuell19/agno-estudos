You look ready. Aw, look at Melissa trying to be shy. She's trying to be shy. You look so cute. - Her real name's Melissa. - Melissa, say something. Something. - Hey, Melissa. - This is Melissa. She was Lisso, like Melissa-a. - She was L-I-S-S-O. - Hey, Melissa! This is the backstage, and this is the wall where our name's gonna be next year. And then it went to Lizzo. And for a while, no one knew Lizzo. My mama knew Lizzo. Please welcome Lizzo, ladies and gentlemen - Ladies and gentlemen, Lizzo! - Lizzo! - Lizzo! - Her name is Lizzo. Give it up, ladies and gentlemen. Lizzo... Lizzo... Lizzo... Lizzo... Someone calls a girl, "Okay, Lizzo" because she's big and she's black and she's doing something that they don't think big black women should be doing like dancing and... being confident. I can only turn "Lizzo" into a compliment by being the best version of myself. Oh, I've been so down And under pressure I'm way too fine To be this stressed, yeah Oh, I'm not the girl I was Or used to be Bitch, I might be better Turn up the music Turn down the lights I've got a feeling I'm gon' be all right - Okay - Okay - All right - All right It's about damn time I'm coming out tonight I'm coming out tonight Coming out tonight I'm coming out tonight I'm coming out tonight I'm coming out tonight I'm coming out tonight - Coming out tonight - Okay Okay All right It's about damn time - Hear me out. - What's up? - Can you hear me? - Okay, I got you. "2 Be Loved" starts off the way "Truth Hurts" ends, right? I'm marrying myself I pull the veil back. Run, right? I'm about to have a panic attack, right? I'm a runaway bride. I hop in the car. I speed off. Then, somewhere in between, a U-Haul pulls up and it's, like, a bunch of my girls. And we can have moments of dancing and all types... Ever since I was very young, I would... I would want something so badly. Okay, talk to you later. - Take care. - Bye. And I would get it. I would just, like, manifest and I would get it. Specifically with music. Be like, "All right, let's go." And I would just make it happen. But it took nearly ten years to get to where I am today. I worked so much and never said no. No matter what part of my story you come in at I'm always chasing the music. "Why is she sleeping in her car?" She's chasing the music. "Why did she move to Minneapolis?" She was going where the music is. And I also might not made it a few times. Because nobody was fucking with me. Nobody was trying to sign a fat black girl that rapped and sang and played the flute. Y'all have no idea how close I was to this not being a thing. I was born in Detroit. You know, my whole family is Detroiters. I'm from the east side, and my mom and dad they both worked for Chrysler. I met Michael at church. We had only dated for about a month and then we got married. Because, I mean, you just know, you know? So the next year we started having children and they were born, like two years apart. Melissa is the only child that took me all the way to term. Her brother used to tease her when she was little and she would just scream. Oh, my God. She had a set of lungs on her. But I would never tell her to shut up or be quiet because I just knew she was gonna use her voice for something. Ever since I was little I was the person who had to mediate family arguments. I was the only person my dad would listen to. Taught me how to communicate. Hi. My father was extremely pro-black. He had a lot of black pride, which I loved and he taught us a lot. He taught me about injustice. He taught us about Emmett Till. I learned about these things growing up because my dad just wanted to show me the way the world was and he really enforced in me to never ever switch up. You know what I'm saying? Oh, there's the picture. That's the one you're talking about, right there, huh? This one. It's my great-grandma. That's Mama Kirkwood. Her and her husband, they founded the church. My church was a family church so everyone was kind of my cousin. My mom played piano in church, and she sang. I was in the choir at my grandfather's church. You know, and then my cousins and I we formed a little group called the Gospel Nightingales. - Come on, matriarch. - All right. Ready. And one... And then later on, I met the Winans and I was able to sing with them, too. We were brought up around like major gospel players in Detroit and our dad would even promote their concerts. So, like, being around them, Lizzo saw the professionalism of the music industry in Detroit. Music has always had a physical effect on me because of the way that I would get so lost in the music in church. If you think You've got me dickmatized I need to get you out of my life New York, can I get a amen? When I walk on stage, I black out. It's not even black out. It's a light. It's a bright light. It's lights on. Heaven, help me If love ain't dead, I'm-a kill it 'Cause it's killin' me Cold world Don't be livin' in a fantasy Got me, it's the only thing I'll ever need Heaven, help me My shows are the way they are because I want you to catch the spirit. And if I'm on that stage, we're connecting to something higher. If you think You've got me dickmatized Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah I need to get you Out of my life Heaven, help me If love ain't dead, I'm-a kill it 'Cause it's killin' me New York, can I get a amen? Amen! When I was a little girl I really believed that I was a bad singer not because I didn't try. It's because I actually was singing and it wasn't good, like... After I had moved to Houston when I was like ten or 11 I would write these pop songs, and I would try to sing it. And I'd be like, "You know what? I'm gonna get somebody to sing that part." Like, I could hold a note. I always had good intonation and pitch but I didn't have the confidence or the power in my voice. There was a singer in my head that I wanted to sound like it was probably Lauryn Hill and Beyonc√©. And I didn't sound like that, so I didn't bother. - Yeah. - Let's pull it out. This is my letterman jacket the one thing we saved from my past. Jefferson. They give you line names, and I don't know why. They were like, "And you gonna be "Spotlight." I was like, "Okay." Hello, hello, hello-ey! And this is... I was Ms. Melissa. Ms. Melissa is so bougie. Band, of course. Flute. And then this side was Class of '06. Oh-six! Jefferson. I put an exclamation point on it, too. - No way. - And that's funny. My Lizzo signature has a exclamation point so some things never change, ho. And it's huge because I was insecure and I was like, "I need the biggest jacket you have." Because I couldn't... I was scared to get something too small and everyone would make fun of me. "Why she got that old letter jacket on?" Why would they even laugh like that? 'Cause that's how they was. They was so mean. They was so mean in Houston. Seventh and eighth grade is when kids started to notice differences. I wore my hair different. I didn't have the body type. Like, I was chunky. There were things I would hide about myself like hiding that I liked anime or that I read Sailor Moon fan fiction. I knew people were making fun of me or laughing at me. I have, like, memories of raising my hand and people being like... "Damn, you going to answer that question, too? Damn!" Of girls hiding my clothes from me after gym class boys calling me "fat ass" on the bus. By the time I was going for the ninth grade I was like, I am sick of being nerdy. I wanna be cool. So I started throwing myself into rap. Yeah, I'm movin' like a snake Them boys get excited When they see that booty shake That was my first rap performance. I remember I went out into the crowd and everybody just started screaming and going wild. Melissa! And that's where I fell in love with live performance. In Houston, freestyle rap was everywhere. We put on the radio, Lil Flip was freestyle rapping and he was the freestyle king. Then Ludacris came out, and I was like oh, I wanna rap like Ludacris. This is it! I'm going to probably outlast Every nigga flowin' And mind you, that was the time when I was taking Phentermine. I was wearing trash bags. I was, like, putting on girdles. I was doing all of this shit in high school to be, like, thin. Like a lot of people, I grew up learning how to hate my body. And it worked. You're just so disgusted with your skin and your flesh and your muscle and your bones and the way that they're designed. And the fat in your body is just, like you wanna cut parts of your body off. Like, how do you... how do I stop that? I don't... I don't wanna feel this... this way anymore. You know? So I was just like... music. "Boys don't like me. I don't need boys. Music is my boyfriend." I was very focused. The first song we wrote for Cornrow Clique was "It Don't Matter Tho." - How did it go? - I have it. - Play it. - Here we go. Man, it don't matter If I wear white or black 'Cause when I'm in the club Niggas be on my back Never failing Never falling off of the track When I walk away Tricks look at my back 'Cause they can't face me And disrespect on my clique If you even breathe wrong Ho, expect to get drunk Wow. Performing to a room of people on their phones, my dream. My dream. When I land in Houston, it's always like, whoa. This is really where I grew up. Detroit is where I was born. Minneapolis is where I was branded and where I became an artist, like a solo artist but I was such an adult by then. Houston is really where I was, like, bred. I moved down to Houston in 1997. My parents had a business in real estate. There were days where we had a lot of money and there was days where we were squeezing it. My brother and sister got involved. It was a family business and I was the only one not involved because I was like, "I'm going to band practice." - Hi. - Hey, how are you? It's crazy to be back. This is where I used to rehearse with my band and yeah. I went to the University of Houston on flute scholarship. The Houston Rodeo was like the biggest thing that I've ever done. Period. Are y'all ready to see who the mystery performer is for Black Heritage Day? It's me! I'm coming back to Houston. It feels like a homecoming. And I remember just thinking that is the biggest thing you could do. Like when Beyonc√© did it and when Selena did it. I've never played a stadium. I've never played a venue that has 75,000 ticketed to see me. I sold out the Houston Rodeo in seven min... I sold out the Houston Rodeo in seven minutes! Oh, my God. Look at Brazil. And I sold out the... God is good. I wanna say thank you to everybody who bought tickets to the Houston Rodeo. It's about to be a... party. I love y'all. Damn! We all knew that it was probably a matter of time before this was going to happen. So now that this has happened and we have a community spread, this isn't about the Rodeo. This is about large gatherings and protecting the... the community. We just got news that the Rodeo is officially canceled. Okay. So I... they literally... I just hung up with them two minutes ago. We can hop on a plane anytime you want. I'm sorry. It sucks. I was pretty fucking sad but people were expecting me to be sad so I'm like, I'm gonna keep it together. Everything's gonna be fine. Welcome. As some of you might know I was scheduled to play the Houston Rodeo today... and we had to cancel. A lot of people are sad right now. A lot of people are sad right now... because somebody they know is sick or they might be sick or we might be afraid of what this means for life as we know it. The pandemic was the cause, and everything else was the effect. I had to stop what I was doing and sit with myself. I was staying home and working on music. I told myself that Monday this Monday, tomorrow would be my deadline for having a bunch of demos, listenable demos to play for my A&R. Fucking idiot. I hate when I do that. I'm so annoyed with myself right now. Being in love You gotta have some self-control Lately, I just... I don't... I don't see it. I just feel like there's people out there there's artists that are way cooler than me. There are artists that are way more politically impactful than me. There's artists that are way more mysterious and mystify people more and... wake people up more. Like, I just don't think that... It's like the stakes changed. I think I was like... "How do I... How do I write bangers when I'm fucking sad and mad and hurting?" I'm such a conduit when I write music. I can't fake it, you know? And I was blocked because I was holding on to a lot. I've always been a little, quote, unquote, "different." I was really, really bookish and I couldn't wait to go home and read and just sit in my room. I can lay in my bed and, like, daydream and imagine things all day and music was definitely an escape. The flute was part of that world that I could go away to and I would just practice for hours. The flute was this weird thing that just happened. Mr. Broughton was my first band teacher ever and he looks at you and picks your horn for you. And for me, I was just chosen for flute. I remember walking into the band hall every day excited about what piece Mr. Broughton had for us. He would write out his own music. He would score it out and it was normally like songs from the radio. He just made playing instruments cool. People assumed that 'cause I was black I wouldn't be good at the flute. And I'm just like, "Let me prove all y'all wrong." So let's bring out Sasha. This is Sasha the Floot. The famous flute. - Oh, Sasha Floot. - Her name is Sasha F-L-O-O-T. Sasha, she gonna post this on her Instagram because she's a cocky little bi-atch. Hey, y'all, it's Sasha and I'm walking you through the Library of Congress. No one in 200 years had ever heard this flute get played. So, of course, she had to twerk. Oh, my God. Are you kidding me? Where do I blow? Well... This is a beginner flute. My dad would come to the concerts with my mom and they thought that, you know Mr. Broughton's band was cool. But he didn't really get invested until I learned "The Carnival of Venice." Oh, shit! Wow! This is the sickest thing ever. "The Carnival of Venice" is this technical feat. It's like a flute's piece and chain. You know what I'm saying? A flute showing out. And my dad thought that that was the coolest thing ever. He was, "Oh, she good at this." He was like, "You need to get a lavalier mic and you need to start playing the flute and putting synthesizers on it." My dad just motivated me a lot. Bye, guys. Oh, God. I don't even wanna think about this. He had his first stroke when I was 16. I remember in my mind being like I'm going to become successful. I'm gonna make money so that I can just make sure that my dad is healthy and... I can buy him a nice house with Mommy and I'll get a live-in nurse that can just, like juice for him every day, and a chef. And I had all these big dreams and plans and goals to help him. Two-thousand six to, like, 2010 was a hot mess blur for me. I graduated high school, and I went to college. My dad was kind of in the house a lot couldn't really work that much. That was the same time the financial crisis hit. My parents' business suffered, but also my dad was sick. The pressure really got to me and I really kind of like froze when it was time to go back to school. So yeah, I just kind of abandoned it. My dad would be manifesting for me. He would be like, you know, "I was praying for you today and I really want you to go back to school and I really want you to study music and be successful in music." He wanted us to be, like, stars because my dad believed he was a star and he believed that my mom was a star. Not a star in the, like, "You're gonna be famous" type of way but like, "Do you know who you are? You came from me, so you should be great." He was actually doing better. He was at a... hospital and... I still don't know what happened to him. I still don't know. He was... he was getting better. When he passed away, I kind of lost the will to make music. I lost the will to live. A lot went to shit in that time. I lost my apartment. I lost my job, I lost my dad. I was sleeping on floors, sleeping in, like my band's rehearsal studio, sleeping in my car. It was a old 1998 Subaru and the side was T-boned in. I slept in my car on Thanksgiving and I just cried. I lost everything. I didn't talk to anyone. I didn't respond to questions. I don't know what this was. It was some weird psychotic break. I would go out in the streets all alone and I would sing by myself. And the thing that came out was just ugly and raw and dark and therapeutic all at once. My relationship with myself had to change because in order to pick myself back up off the floor I had to trust myself. I had to love that person. I was like, all right, well, I can't stay in Houston anymore. And I kind of threw myself into the unknown. Hello. I'm gonna be singing "Ghosts." It is one of the songs I sing with my band, Ellypseas and it's written by Jean Guillory. Not me. I'm Lizzo. Okay. I will never touch you Rather, you will never touch me Good luck, though Lost in the desert And losing your mind Looking for something you were hoping to... Telescopic, biopic I'm moonwalking on Mars I had been doing, like, Skype sessions with this producer. That's my cousin. That's my sister. And he was like, "Let's go to Minneapolis. That's where the music scene is." So I hopped in his Jeep, and we drove to Minneapolis and I found my voice. Nah mean? Nah, you don't Anyways I get that green They said I won't Was the rumor since the womb And I continue steady blooming Dooming, glooming, on these people That be thinking That they doin' something First, I was in Lizzo and The Larva Ink. Then I was in The Chalice. And then I was in GRRRL PRTY. Shooting you from every angle Hurt your feelings and your paycheck Got a feeling you won't make it, bye Oops, I didn't know you was a wegula Oops, my bad I met Sophia Eris like the first week I moved to Minneapolis at a block party. Oh, you's a wegula Oh, you's a wegula Oops It was hardcore, it was party, clust it was, like, rebellious, it was very punk rap, you know? And her and I together, we were just, like trying to do anything we could. We were hungry. Sophia became my DJ. It was kind of like we needed each other and we didn't really know what this was all gonna be but we're sisters, you know? Running and running until I can't go I cut the piece, put that P in pocket Partly polyethylene Partly a polygon made up of particles Sparkle, that glitter ain't gold I was working in a producer's home studio and his style was very Rap Olympics where I'm like... Remember that gooey gooey you took And said, "Ooh wee, ooh wee I need two or two-ee" And he's like, "All right, one more time." And I'm like... Remember that gooey gooey you took And said, "Ooh wee, ooh wee" I need two-a twoey-a These for my baby boo-y And then I evolved into Big Grrrl Small World where I was like, I wanna get weird. I started getting into like sonics. The throat got all these little nuances to it. - You got to get under... - I studied music theory and I was like, I need to flex that. And so for Big Grrrl Small World I got very in the driver's seat. B-b-big girl S-s-small world Because nobody knows my truth, you know. I have to like find it. Got a lot on my chest So here's my breast reduction I hear the sound of gums bumping They ain't saying nothing I'm sick and tired of being typecast Like Lindsay Lohan When I'm gon' probably outlast Every nigga flowing All these niggas want to ride it All these niggas wanna ride it Boom! Lizzobangers, what I did with Lazerbeak kind of came out unexpectedly for me 'cause I have been in girl bands my entire life. And now we just got word of a new solo record. - Yay! - Big Grrrl Small World. I'm so excited. I finally just went in and started recording. And I had this breakthrough moment where I wrote a song called "My Skin." When I wrote that song, I was like, now, I know my mission. Like, I know why I'm here. I know why I have this mouthpiece. And everything else became super, super clear. What do you love the most about your body? My skin. I love my skin. And this is something I was born with, you know? You can't buy this at the store, so hey. Your whole life, when you are on the other side of the spectrum of, like, what's hot or what the models are walking in on the runway. You're called these names. You're called "fat," you're called "big," you're called "ew." I remember being like, should I call myself "big"? I mean, I might as well call myself big before everybody else do on the Internet. And then one day, I was like, yo, like I'm gonna be in this body forever. I'm gonna be this bitch forever so you either live your life not liking her or you live your life trying to love her. Uh yeah Ooh, what's deeper than What's deeper than the darkest Best-kept secret? Beneath the surface, we could Let it bring us together... Before that, I hadn't heard anyone say "I'm in love with myself" on a song. But people connected to it, and it was personal and it was real. So I realized that was who I was. Beautiful thing that you ever seen Is even bigger Than what we think it means I used to wanna be a cool rapper but after "My Skin" it hit me, like, I'm really a songwriter. I woke up in this And I wanted to write a song that the whole world could sing back to me. My skin Your skin, yeah Oh, I can't wash it away No, you can't take this from me Minneapolis accepted, like, every single part of me. The part of me that had a little bit of a accent and loved to freestyle rap and then the other side of me that was like, I listen to indie rock music and play classical flute. I feel like this city gave me the opportunity to just be who I am. I don't think I would have left Minneapolis if it weren't for MTV Wonderland. It's gonna be on and popping, Khaled. You gotta watch it. It premieres September 15 at 11.00pm. Honestly, hosting that TV show was the only reason why I moved to LA which, it weren't for that then I would have never met Myke. And then, I would have never fallen in love. But that's a long story. Wow, all these people are just, like, regular drivers. They don't know that I'm fucking... - A first-timer? - Yeah. Whew, another car, look. Why am I not honking? There it is. Full stop. I don't do no California... Whoa! When was the last time you drove? Two-thousand and... I haven't been able to get a license for, like, years 'cause somebody had stole my identity and I had two licenses down in Houston. And one of them had so many outstanding fucking warrants that, you know, I was riding dirty. I was riding dirty just being there. - But you got your license. - I know. Drivers don't want to wave? So much has changed in all those years. So much has changed since 1900 and... - Watch the squirrel. - Squirrel! I'm not gonna hit the squirrel. I'm a defensive driver, you know, like I can say I'm probably the best defensive driver there is. What? Oh, my God. Am I not supposed to hit that? Wow! Suck it, Texas. Texas was trying to keep me down, man. But you know what? I'm a driver now. Artists are never allowed to come back on the sophomore record with, like, something real. It always has to be something that's, like, so constructed that it's, like, bulletproof. Of course, I wanna be, like "Yeah, let's go out with something fucking vulnerable." Like, trust me, I got a lot of pent-up shit that I'll be just watching. I'm like, damn, I wish I could say this. I wish I could say that, but... What are some... actually some of those pent-up things that you feel like you can't say? When I'm feeling shitty about myself, I'm honest. But then the whole Internet goes crazy and it's like on the fucking news. But I'm like, I'm just being honest, you know? I'm just saying the things that people feel about themselves whether they're big or small, every single day. In this fucking world of Instagram supermodels you're the only girl your size, your style, that they accept. Even the people that talk shit about you they're talking shit about you 'cause they're confused - as to why you're accepted. - Yeah. I'm so fucking happy with the way that I look and who I am and it's so crazy, 'cause you put my body next to Kim Kardashian's and, baby people would think that I'm wrong. But I'm like, this is the body I was given. - Now we're talking. - You know? I don't think I wanna write a song tackling everything at once that we're talking about. - Right. - I think to do something else and then drop these kind of like unabashed truths in there and then people are like, "Oh, okay." Hi, motherfucker Did you miss me? I've been twerking, making smoothies And all these rappers They've been sexting I'm in a meeting And I look better Than you seen me last I been training, I can flex that ass So when I shake it I can shake it fast Make that camera flash Camera flash, camera flash If you're looking for the sign Bitch, I'm it... She talkin' about making an album. Hey! A album? A album, bitch? A album? Absolutely not. I'm not making no fucking alb... Just a second Let me fix my wig, yeah Now it's time to finally Talk my shit, yeah Oh, did you forget I'm still that bitch, yeah I live inside your head And pay no rent, yeah A album! I'm blessed, I said I'm getting some head I'm Texas Toast I'm cornbread-fed I'm good, I'm great I'm two hours late But I'm on my way Hey, hey, hey Yeah. Something like... 'cause like the second verse is good. There's just some things in the first verse and then there's like a few things in the hook and then the second time, when the pre comes. So the whole song? There is more pressure from not only my management team but from the label. I was writing good songs, and I was like oh, shit, like, I've got some really good songs. Should we see... should we see how it sounds? Yeah, let's hear it. I played them for Atlantic Records. And for me, I thought they would be like "This is it. You've done it again. Girl, you did it." And... they just were like... "Yeah..." I was so fuckin' mad that day. "I was like, I don't trust the damn label right now. I need to trust myself." I mean, it sounds insane, but they're just super thorough. You are coming from a place where just you're now in a... you've won Grammys and shit now so they wanna keep that up too. They want critical acclaim. I don't know what music is. I don't know what songwriter do. I'm tired. When did you write "Good as Hell" and "Truth Hurts"? Did you care? No. - Did you overthink those songs? - No. You got a point there, buddy. You got a point there, buddy. The story of how "Truth Hurts" evolved... I got my heart stomped on in 2017. I wish that there were cameras then. Shit. 'Cause it was really just a sad day. It was around my birthday and I had a voicemail and a missed phone call from this guy. He was like, "Please don't contact me. Don't call me, don't text me." And I was like, "Huh?" It was painful. Like, I slid down the wall. I was crying. Like, I was crying for days. I didn't eat. So I go into the studio and I was just talking about my day. I was... It was that weekend. Like, there was this dude on the Minnesota Vikings who wanted to go on a date with me, so I hit him back. And then, I took my weave out and just went and got my hair washed and pressed and cut. I just wanted some new energy. I took a bomb photo, and I was like life is fucked up right now, but at least I look good. Remember, I was like, "You trying to break my heart? Breaks my heart. 'Cause you ain't never even had it." It was just like a magical moment of everything I've ever said out of raw emotion and I just put it in a song. That's why it's so important that I just keep writing shit like that. I'm glad it happened. Sometimes I'll be laughing to myself like, "This boy." And I just sing the song about him. This is my favorite part. I just took a DNA test Turns out I'm a hundred percent that bitch Even when I'm crying crazy Yeah, I got boy problems That's the human in me - Bling bling... - This is the cover shoot of "'Cause I Love You." Like, that is the black backdrop and I sat right where he is. I just got so excited. I'm about to listen to the album. I'm about to be naked. - It's gonna be fuckin'... - Yeah. I'm about to fuck shit up, bitch. We're good. Just a little tit. It was kind of the beginning of this wild ride. I was just excited. You've been fucking killing it. A genreless pop star, a woman of color. - Black, girl. The color is black! - Peace and beauty. - Can I get a amen? - Amen! It's always kinda been like this and then this year, was just like... I don't know why this bathtub is full of Skittles. It gets weird. Black girls in Germany, Ma. We love you. We love you! I'm platinum, baby! It is incredible. Oh, my God. God damn! That's fine! All your guitars and shit that you added are missing. Maybe it's just in my ears. Do you hear it in the house, Devon? So it's missing, yeah? Tracks are missing. It hurts my feelings. This is my show, this is my music, this is my life. Please don't hurt my feelings. Please don't break my heart. Let's all be the best we can fucking be. This is fine, but this is a rehearsal. But when it's time to go tonight, it's time to motherfucking go. Thanks, everybody. I think in 2019 I was growing faster than I could keep up. Like, holy shit, now we're doing Coachella. And I wanted the set to be perfect. And, you know, I was a little big for my britches. Everybody, hands up We gon' have us a good-ass time today, Coachella. Nothing but body positivity and self-love. The music kept cutting in and out because... And baby, worship me our system had overheated. I'm-a keep singing this shit. Worship me We just kept dancing and I kept singing. And baby, worship me Back then, I felt like who I am now. But everything around me was always kind of like half done. I want the show to be so much bigger and better - than what it is right now. - Yeah, yeah. As I'm standing there, I was like, "Huh?" We need pyrotechnics. We need videos. It breaks my heart because these people wanna see a big show and I wanna put on a good show. Our infrastructure was tiny back then. And at that point, I was, like living in a one-bedroom box apartment. It's like, it wouldn't be a fucking Lizzo award show performance if it wasn't down to the fucking wire. I'm just so fucking tired. It's 2.00am. - Welcome. - Oh, my God. - Welcome to my crowded apartment. - Welcome. I don't know how you got this done in less than 24 hours. Fingers crossed. - Should I put it over my head? - No, you can go ahead. T-minus seven hours before the AMAs. We were struggling back then. Two a.m. In my apartment Trying on a fucking gown Beautiful. But I gotta give everybody credit. Like, I was working with such a small group of people and we kept going. Look. Look at it from behind. Jerome The show don't stop. The show must go on. Poor little baby Who told you that you stood a chance With this royalty? You're so sweet, bless your heart Can't let a pretty face distract me From business And God as my witness Your ugly ass won't either - I'm sorry... - The music has been my first love. Music has been my most consistent lover. And I always felt like my music is a conversation with the people who listen to it. Jerome But when I perform music sometimes I relive painful experiences. But music didn't do that to me, life did. And because of music, I can express that pain in a way that makes life easier. Jerome Jerome Go on and take your ass home Where the peaches have Thorns Don't cry for me, baby Don't cry, no Oh, don't cry for me, baby Me and Myke had been friends since Wonderland. It's complicated because we're friends with a lot of feelings. I didn't really know what to do with all those feelings so we were off and on, you know? One day we were on, and the next day we were off. It hurt because I loved him but honestly, I don't think I was ready for love. Where you goin'? Where you goin'? I feel so bad. I don't know. I... I feel so bad. I don't know how this person just has, like... all of my heart. You know what I mean? I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just want it to, like... I just want the... I just want, like, the feelings to stop. You look so nice, Shelby. Thank you. Girl, this a hard one. I don't even got no words for you, 'cause I know exactly how you feel. Yeah. Isn't it so scary just being like what if this hurts, or what if it doesn't work? Like... It's not even about him. It's just about, like... fear, like, I have a lot of fear. You know? This is the first time I've ever been so close to someone who doesn't need me or doesn't ask me for anything which was something I thought was nice at first. It was refreshing. And then, now, it's like, oh, no, you don't need me. You don't need me at all. Just put on the Harry Styles album. Oh, fuck. Oh, this fucking song. And there's no one to blame But the drink in my wandering hands Bitch! Don't sing my truth, bitch. What am I now... What am I now, bitch? What if I'm someone I don't want around? I'm falling again I'm falling again... I'm falling I forgot he said that. I don't know. Why did he say that? I was good till he said that. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. You know, music is really powerful. You know, you should watch a Lizzo show. I can't. It's impossible. Can I sing to y'all? I will always... In case nobody told you today I'm so glad - that you're still with us - That you're still with us I love that. Write that down. In case nobody told you today I wanna say, "Celebrity is new to me and so is people judging me," but that's not exactly right. Fame is pretty new... new to me. I'm used to people judging me. Fame is pretty new, but I got But I've been used To people judging me That's why I moved the way I move That's why I'm so in love with me You can say "and." That's why I moved the way I move And why I'm so in love with me In case nobody told you today You're special In case nobody made you believe You're special Well, I will always love you the same You're special I'm so glad that you're still with us Broken, but damn You're still perfect Okay, now I sing it in tune. And... one, two, three, four five, and six, seven, eight. The Big Grrrls are an extension of myself. I'm not small and I remember being like well if I'm gonna have people on stage with me they gotta look like me. So it inspired me to just be like, I need big girls. And I was like, "We can call them the Big Grrrls." The Big Grrrls went from being like a physical thing to like an energetic thing, like how big is your spirit how big is your heart? - How we feeling, y'all? - Good as hell! I just want to let y'all know I watched the footage from the rehearsals yesterday and it just looks so good. And now that we have perfection I think it's time to just bring realness to it so the whole world can fall in love with the person that we've fallen in love with, you know? So I wanna talk about what we felt and talk about how we can feel better. Not even better, how we can feel actually good as hell when we're performing this song. Because, I'm not gonna lie yesterday, I... I didn't feel good as hell. I was stressed out instead of just kind of opening up and letting it flow from me you know, but that's me. We'll start over here, and we'll move through. Like, how did you feel, as you were going through? I feel like you feel like we are capable of everything and you think that I'm capable of more than I think I'm capable of. And so I was fighting this inclination to shrink and to, like... it's... it's okay to, like for all of us to be, like, big, to take up space. Even like stepping on the train sometimes. I know for me the first thing I do is try to shrink up to make space for other people. Isn't that funny that that's our inclination is to shrink ourselves? Why do I have to shrink myself? Why is this too big for you? Do you know what I mean? And this ain't too big for the main stage. If anything, it's just the right size - Come on. Come on. - For an arena, for a stadium. - Come on. - Light me up. I trying not to cry because I'm gonna be all right. But... And so, being here and going through the steps... and like going through this whole process with everybody it's just like, yo, now I have to give myself permission to be in this moment, so... There's nothing I can do to take away the fear of vulnerability. But I think that we can use that when you're performing tomorrow and realize how strong you look and realize how much strength you're gonna give people. I gotta be on point. I have to. I can't... You can't let nobody see you sweat. You have to be three times better than. It's not two times. It's three times. - You know what I mean? - Yes. And it's just... Oh, my God. Being big, your body is politicized. Being black, your skin is politicized. Being a woman, your gender is politicized. So we're actually making quite the political statement being all three. Look where you are, you know? This performance isn't like oh, we have, like, a token big girl. This performance is about us. It's for us. And it's not... and it's not a joke. This is dead serious. I want you to imagine that you walked to that train and then you hopped in a limo and drove to the VMAs and you looked back to that girl walking to the train you said, "I knew it, girl. I told you, didn't I tell you?" You are the self that your younger self saw. They would look up to you. Let me talk to y'all for a second. I'm tired of the bullshit. And I don't have to know your story to know that you're tired of the bullshit, too. It's so hard trying to love yourself in a world that doesn't love you back. Am I right? So I wanna take this opportunity right now to just feel good as hell because you deserve to feel good as hell. We deserve to feel good as hell! So tell me how you feeling Good as hell! So tell me how you feeling Good as hell If you don't know what to do You got to... If he don't love you anymore Walk your fine ass out the door And do your hair toss Check my nails Baby, how you feelin'? Feeling good as hell Say good as hell Feeling good as hell Say good as hell Feeling good as hell Yeah! Okay, so basically Myke is coming to my house at noon... to talk. Wait, what? He wrote me yesterday. Wait, what? I know. Wait, what? I was like, are you frozen or... Even if he wants to be with me, I don't think that I could... I couldn't handle that. No, you couldn't. I just wanna talk to him. We had such a great relationship. We talked about things that I can't really talk about with anybody. I just hope that I don't fall in love with him all over again after seeing him. Because he got ASAP Rocky braids now, bitch. But anyway. Going live. - Is it time? - 62nd Annual Grammy Award Nominations Announcement. We got to pack up quick because we got, like... Fuck. We're boarding our fucking plane. - It's starting. - Oh, God. Mike, sit down. Best Pop Solo Performance. "Spirit," Beyonc√©. Yes. "Bad Guy," Billie Eilish. - Shit. - Oh, my God. "Truth Hurts." Oh, my God! Oh, my God. That's crazy. Oh, my God. Oh, shit. Oh, my God. So I told Alex my Grammys idea. He's the first person to hear it. It came to me on the plane today. Why men great 'Til they gotta be great? All of a sudden you see these thick black girl ballerinas. Boom. Yes! Boom. They're ballerining. You coulda had a bad bitch Here come the Big Grrrls. So I wanna go back and forth between a Baroque version and a trap version. I don't play tag, bitch I been it Sasha comes down from the sky. Fifteen-second flute Baroque solo. You know what I mean? And everybody's like, "What the fuck? I didn't know the flute was so lit." Last chorus, everybody. Ballerinas dancing, Big Grrrls dancing. Orchestra's back. Boom... Actually, in my crazy-ass head the orchestra been there the whole time. - And it's period. - Fin. I love it. So good. So here's my idea. It involves finding some thick black girl ballerinas so you need to find them now. I hear you 100% but black ballet dancers are so much of an anomaly. Right. I know. But I've seen ballet dancers but I've never seen a curvaceous, thick Black ballet dancer. Because they don't get the training and they don't get the training because people don't want to teach them because of their bodies or their skin, you know? That's why it's important to me. All right. I'm already on it. I'm gonna search the country high and wide. High and thick. Fuck yes. All these black girls at the fucking Grammys shitting on these niggas? Period! Y'all came the fuck through. Y'all was like, "Oh, you want loud, bitch?" That's what I want. You know what I'm saying? They told us to shut up for too long! But I'm... I'm so proud of you all. And thank you so much for being a part of this. I'm gonna leave, and I trust y'all. Y'all sound beautiful. Fill up the room. Take up all the space in the music, in the theater in they face, in your life. You know what I'm saying? This is like... It's raining blessings, so just receive it. Over now I woke up this morning and I was just like... I know, like... Fuck... - Fucked up in a bad way. - Yeah. Thanks, guys. - I'm so proud of you. - I know. Damn. I know. I woke up this morning, and I was in my bathroom. And I was like, whoa, look what... I was like, shocked. I was like, what am I about to do today? - That's good. - Like, look what... look what God has done. I'm talking about, that's crazy. It's like, my first rap crew, and then when I moved to Minneapolis, The Chalice, like... so glad y'all are here. Why men great 'Til they gotta be great? I just took a DNA test Turns out I'm a hundred percent that bitch Even when I'm crying crazy Yeah, I got boy problems That's the human in me Bling bling, then I solve 'em That's the goddess in me You coulda had a bad bitch Non-committal Help you with your career Just a little You're supposed to hold me down But you're holding me back And that's the sound of me Not calling you back - Why men... - And the Grammy goes to... Lizzo! Thank you so much for lifting me up. Let's continue to reach out, hold each other down and lift each other up. God bless you. Thank you so much. Period! So if you fight like a girl Do your thing All of this feels unavoidable. I've always described my life as being on a certain type of track. Now I know why. Sometimes I feel so connected to the black women who came before me who didn't really get their praise... like my grandma or my great-grandma. I do this for them and so many black women like Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Big Mama Thornton who, like, literally invented rock and roll. And none of them get the credit. So it's like, well, this is for her. And if you feel like a girl Then you real like a girl, bitch Breaking news out of Louisville, Kentucky where a grand jury handed down its decision of three officers involved in the deadly police shooting of Breonna Taylor. No one is charged with anything directly related to Breonna Taylor's death. I wonder if some shit's gonna pop off in LA because of this Breonna Taylor shit. At the end of the day, I don't think it's gonna be as extreme because I think black women's lives matter way less to people. Breonna Taylor was, like, us really crying out for respect this time, but I... I still don't think it was enough. It's sad. It really fucking pisses me off. I think there's just so much work to be done in the world and there's so many people who are suffering from the system. Like, I will never understand... I mean, I actually do understand white supremacy because it's working. How How do you think it makes black women feel When you never see us And you never will? Fuck, I don't know. Oh, what if it's... When you never see her When you never see us someday - But someday you will. - But someday you will Oh, I like that. How do you think it makes A black woman feel When you never see her But someday you will? The system is effective because of racism and sexism and classism. We just need everyone to realize that this isn't working for all of us. My love, my love My love, my love... My love, my love We're gonna take over Boston Boulevard. Here we go! 'Cause when they finally see us They going to see it For themselves, oh How do you think it makes A black woman feel When you never see her? But someday you will Black women have been the heartbeat of every movement from Sojourner Truth to the black women leading the Black Lives Matter movement. We are at the bottom but yet we always raise our voices first. I'm so proud to be a black woman and an activist because when I'm loud, they hear this mouth. Period. I feel like, as a black woman I have been put in this position that I didn't really ask for of like making people feel good and making noise about issues to make a change. Because that's what we do. It's what black women do. We've always done that. But sometimes... I wish that that wasn't always kind of put on us. Because I know that easily, as a black woman I can wear that burden and let it weigh me down like a mule. And I don't wanna be anybody's fucking mule. Hey, Brian? I have one, two, three. It was really important to me that the Big Grrrls could twerk. I've been twerking since I was 12. And it's in the music that I listened to growing up from New Orleans bounce to Southern rap. "Twerk," the word, is a newer way to describe the dance move that has been going on for hundreds of years. There's forms of twerking in almost every indigenous culture. Black culture is the only sect of culture that becomes mainstream and loses its origin. When you know where it comes from, you put more respect on it. Blackness is a commodity. It's a hot commodity. The media described twerking as, I quote "disturbing and disgusting." Once mainstream twerking was misunderstood and taken out of context. So I wanna do everything in my power to prevent the erasure of blackness from twerking. Look up in the mirror Oh, my God, it's me So much Prada on me, I'm a prodigy Coconut and rose in my skin regime Shaking that ass is this thing that is sexy. It's exciting. It's extremely feminine. Feelin' like a stripper When I'm lookin' in the mirror I'll be slapping on that ass Gettin' thicker and thicker Sing it to me. It beats at the heart of my ancestors and it became a part of my brand. It is one of my favorite things to do. I can't wait for this album to come out so I can shit on everybody who's been trying to reduce me to my body. So Lizzo right now is getting canceled. Lizzo Is Over Party was trending on Twitter. Am I getting some backlash right now? That dress left little to the imagination. With nothing underneath but a thong. She got a very pretty face but she keep showing her body off, like, come on, man. She became the number-one trending topic on Twitter. No respect for art history or any historical artifacts. I don't think people should be canceling Lizzo over this. Being overweight is the new goal. She's merely shucking and jiving for an audience of white feminists. On Twitter, a large amount of black people have decided they don't like Lizzo's music. What they end up saying about her music is she makes music for white people. I think there's nothing that hurts my feelings more than the rejection of my own people. But I feel like, the bigger you get... the more your blackness is taken away. I was like so sad last night 'cause I saw some... something on TikTok. And it was like this thing where it was like comparing some other artists to me. "The reason why this person doesn't have as much like mainstream success is because Lizzo makes palatable music and makes white people feel comfortable." I don't make nobody comfortable. I've never walked in a room and been like, "Like me." I walk in a room, and I'm like, "Accept me." And the fact that people use me as this think piece on why someone else doesn't have success because of my proximity to whiteness is like, bruh, like, huh? The James Webb Telescope just published a photo of a grain of sand and there are millions of stars and planets and life forms and celestial bodies within that grain of sand. You think username FuckThatBitch has any authority on your existence and why you're here? No. Okay, so here's the tea. I'm back with Myke. So y'all actually going somewhere or... No, just to a park. I'm gonna be like, "Happy birthday. Let's go on a picnic." You know. You know, spend some time with your boo. I'm gonna cuss him out too, though. Like, yeah, we're on good terms, but... So that's the tea. - Hey, guys. - Hey. All right, I'll talk to you later. All right. Bye, girl. I warmed up for you today. - Okay, I worked out for you. - Really? You did? Yeah. - So you... - A lot of my issues with my dad. No, I'm just kidding. Talked to my girlfriend just today They reminded me Of when you had me crying in the car Me and Myke needed the space. And I'm grateful 'cause we grew we learned about ourselves, and most importantly we learned that we didn't wanna be apart. And I like prayed about it. I was like, "Help me be an unconditional lover." Because to love somebody with conditions hurts too fucking bad. 'Cause, boy, you know me better You know me so much better He's my muse. I've written quite a few songs about him. "Break Up Twice," "Naked," "Coldplay," "2 Be Loved." The whole album. You know that I don't break up twice Hell, yeah. But I never had nobody With a love like you It would be a shame Not to see this through - That's it. - Who gonna put up with your Gemini shit? Okay, cool. I don't know who would put up with the Gemini shit. I haven't done stage banter in so long. Jesus Christ, there's so many mosquitoes in this car. Oh, my God. - They are still in here. - This is a nightmare. I'm sorry. Minnesota for you. Welcome back. This is exciting. It is. Oh, my God. It's the first show in what, a year, man? If I didn't play a show before January it would've been two years. Wow. Oh, my God, you guys. All right, everybody. Close your eyes and just squeeze the hand of the person next to you. We did not think we would make it here but Lord God, You brought us here to put this show on to make people's nights better, Lord God, their lives better. Thank You for putting us here to be positive change in the world. We're so grateful for the whole team. I would be nothing up there without you guys. Every person in this circle is a part of the bigger picture a part of bringing light into the world. This show is already done, and we have already won in Jesus' name. - Amen! - Amen! I never thought I would make it back to the stage, man. This is my first show in nearly two years. And it feels so special to be doing it here back in Minnesota... where my solo career took off. Thank you so much for accepting me for who I am. Here we go. One, two, three. Sing! Mirror, mirror on the wall Don't say it, 'cause I know I'm cute - Ooh, baby - Louis down to my drawers LV all on my shoes That's how I roll Y'all don't know how much I been through to be right here, right now on this stage. It ain't my fault That I'm out here gettin' loose Gotta blame it on the Goose Gotta blame it on my juice One, two, three. Sing! It ain't my fault That I'm out here gettin' loose Gotta blame it on my juice Blame it, blame it on my juice Oh! - Oh, my God. - Congratulations. I messed up so many times. You're so good. What are you talking about? The flute stuff drives everybody crazy. - Once that flute comes out. - Oh, yeah. - Banter was on point. - Thank you. My banter was sloppy tonight, but... It's your first time hearing songs about you. I'm glad they're all jams. They are jams. That feels good. It's very... I'm just excited because my biggest regret on "'Cause I Love You" because I didn't have a car and I didn't have speakers. I didn't listen to masters and get the timing right in between each track. That's my biggest regret on "'Cause I Love You." I'll listen to it to this day and be like... It makes me really happy because so many people don't care these days. - I... overcare. - Thank you for caring. I... It wakes me up in the middle of the night. I'm like, "Like a Girl" went into... whatever my other songs are. All right, let's listen to the end of the side real quick into... I keep on writing these songs 'Cause he keep on doin' me wrong And my girls keep singin' along I guess that I'm not alone Anyway... A bee's dick to the left. A little sooner. So small. I'm saying that phrase forever. Yes, okay. I guess that I'm not alone Anyway... That's it, baby. That's it, baby! Oh, God. This is so fuckin' buttery. $55,000 flute, man. It is really gorgeous. That... The way that head joint goes in is a little sexual. I'm not gonna lie. I was like, okay. I just hope that Eri didn't make nails that will interfere. Wait, you're playing flute? The nails I made are definitely not... Let's see 'em. What the hell? This is literally... this is like a wine opener. This is fire, though. Do you think it's not gonna work? There's only one way to find out. Fuck. It's like, why do I have to make things so hard? Like it's already hard enough. It's like, okay, play the flute on the carpet. Cool. Memorize the song you're playing. Cool. Play it with fucking corkscrew nails. Damn! You feel comfortable? Of course not, but that's the point! If I feel comfortable, then it wouldn't be worth doing. It wouldn't be... my life wasn't on hard mode. I had this huge, depressive episode when I dropped out of college, 'cause I was like "It was all for nothing." You know, all those years studying flute and those dreams of being like a famous flautist but now it's like, bitch, you are a famous flautist. For like a 12-year-old nerd when Mr. Broughton was like "All right, who 'bout to be on flute?" And if I had a vision... Like, walking on the Met Gala carpet playing flute with, like, the most expensive, beautiful flute in the world. I'd like, zoom back and be like... "Me!" Like, life doesn't take you too far away from who you're supposed to be. I'm still trying to process the fact that this is my house. My parents, they didn't verbally say "You need to own everything," but they instilled it in me at a young age. You know, they owned their shit. So as a person who slept on floors and... rented for my entire life until right now... it is a milestone. The least we can do is have ownership of anything really, in this country. Where we didn't even have autonomy of our bodies and our lives and our culture. - Hello! - Hello! - Happy Juneteenth! - Happy Juneteenth. How are you? Juneteenth is a big deal in Texas. It was almost like Juneteenth was like the Black Independence Day. I'm protective of blackness. I'm protective of my blackness. People like to mishandle my blackness. Thank God they don't have ownership of it. So exciting. This is a little bit better. In my life, ownership is very important. Like, the ownership and the pride that I have in Yitty, my clothing line. I've been wearing shapewear since I was in fifth or sixth grade. It was embarrassing and shameful and I don't ever want anyone to feel that way ever again. So cute. I feel like the length is a little long. I remember talking to like creative directors of these huge brands and being like "Why don't y'all make clothes for big people?" And watching them kind of stammer over their words. And because I made it happen I'm like, how can I clear this channel so that girls who look like me can just take the elevator up? That's why I made my TV show. Watch out for The Big Grrrls. I wanted to make a show about big girls because you don't get to see big girls shown in this light shown as the protagonist and shown for her talents and not just like the punchline of a joke. Today is the day fans have had circled around their calendars. Release date for Lizzo's new album. It's called Special. You finished. Three frickin' years, baby. I've been working on this album. I feel amazing. Last night, my dad was in my dream. And I don't really, like, dream about memories. I dream about, like... realm dreams where I'm very aware that he isn't physically here and I'm like, "Oh, they let you come over here." This time it was like, "Oh, I'm so excited that we get to like hang out for a little bit." And it was a lotta like me clapping and jumping up and down and being excited. And then I woke up, and I was like "Wow. Thank you." He cared so much about my career especially in his later years and I think a lot of that energy that was put towards me being successful and everything. It hasn't stopped, you know? I don't think somebody's love for you stops when they go. Like, energy doesn't die. It just changes form. Hi, everybody. If we have not met yet, I'm Lizzo. It's really important for me to know who everyone is that's a part of my show 'cause my music and my show is very personal to me. Can you hear me this way better? That's fucking weird. Once upon a time I had one person on the road with me. I had my DJ Sophia, and I had two dancers and a table with a cloth and a chair. And now I'm emotional. This is wild for me, because this is my first arena show. And I don't know how the fuck I got here but... I do know who I got here with and it's with all of you wonderful people and I just wanna say thank you from the bottom of my heart. You're making my dreams come true, so... In case nobody told you today You're special In case nobody made you believe You're special Well, I will always love you the same I like the story of my success... because it took so much hard work and time to be here. But I know that when people see me on stage they see themselves. In case nobody told you today - Yeah! - You're special When I was a little girl all I wanted to see was me in the media someone fat like me Black like me beautiful like me. If I could go back and tell little Lizzo something I'd be like, "You gonna see that person. But, bitch, it's gonna have to be you." I'm so glad, so glad, so glad Just look up, you know, and smile. I wanna see your teeth. - Yes! - Yes! That's the smile. You're making me feel something which I think that's all that matters. Just go for it. Go all the way for it. Don't halfway do it. So I want you to be like... Then you're like, this my first time riding a plane. How did I get here? That's what I want. Don't be afraid Oh, yeah When the world Can't look me in my eyes When the darkness takes over my mind Hold me close Don't let me run away Don't you be afraid No... no! When the weight falls in And you're outside Won't you be there Standin' by my side Hold me close Don't let me run away Don't be afraid No, no If you love me You love all of me And if you love me You love all of me Or none of me at all If you love me If you love me... If you love me
