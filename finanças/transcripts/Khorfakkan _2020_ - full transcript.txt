Very well It's been quiet for months No trouble from the mountains The camel convoys travel in safety. Business is booming. Thank God Thanks be to God Peace be upon you Peace and mercy of God be upon you, too However We must remain on our guard Of course, Haj, of course I wanted to recruit more men But, the governor thinks it unnecessary He believes our walls alone are enough to protect the town We are grateful, Yousef, for your constant vigilance over us May God bless you Just doing my duty, Abu Ali Excuse me, Haj I want to sit for a while See you, Haj, peace be upon you Peace be upon you, too Peace be upon you Peace be upon you, too Ali!

Glory be to Allah Come on Ali, We need to herd the goats now Peace be upon you Peace and mercy of God be upon you, too These are truly beautiful horses They will bring you abundant profit, God willing God willing It is a rewarding business, indeed Your thoroughbreds are the favoured breed for battle However, we got to make sure the horses are healthy enough To bear the strain of travel When are you sailing towards India, God willing? We wanted to leave today But as you see, we've still got a lot of cargo to load We will sail tomorrow, God willing Bringing us to Surat in six nights May God grant you success If you need any help, don't hesitate to ask We consider ourselves part of this town, Abdullah And so you are, God willing One Two Three Four Five We've lost one! My dad will punish me now I think I've found it I'll fetch it back Wandered off too far my little one, but don't worry I'll get you home safe and sound What is that noise, Abu Ali? Mohieddin! Mohieddin! Do you recognize that sound? Not sure Are these idiots too feeble to sink a tiny boat like this?! Listen up Our captain Albuquerque wants that boat sunk immediately! Come around the mountains of Khor I want that boat stopped Move it Could it be an echo from the mountains? No, I think it's coming from the sea Let's get you home, Father? No Not till we figure out what's going on While People are in a panic, I will not sit around at home And leave things like this Let's go I know the sound of a cannon when I hear it Do you know where it's coming from? Not yet, sir The guards on the walls, haven't been able to pinpoint the source of the sound So what are you doing here? The governor ordered me to inspect the walls and report back Alright Alright Get going And bring us back something concrete What do you reckon Mohieddin? If the sound was really coming from the sea I fear for Khorfakkan, for what will follow Do you see anything? A boat coming fast towards town Right after the sound we heard There must be some danger on the way We've got to go back now Auntie. Auntie Go home now, Hurry The Portuguese The Portuguese What about the Portuguese? Their ship fired on us They're on their way here Come ashore Come ashore, so we can understand what you're saying. Come on! There's no time We need to be on our way We must alert the King of Hormuz Be safe! There he is. Let's go Dad Dad Why have I brought you all along with me? Why? To carry out my orders. Correct? To fulfill the king's wishes To establish the authority of the great and holy state of Portugal To seize Muslim boats. Correct? So why didn't you execute my orders? Oh! Commander It seems that the Lord May have given you another chance to redeem yourselves One Two Three A fourth ship And a fifth I saw a fleet of six ships Never before has a danger come from… Be patient, Hormuzi! Tell us what's going on Yousef After a Sanbuk has come to warn us We have sighted Portuguese ships anchored off the creek What we heard must have been the sound of their cannons Will they attack us? Only God knows But, based on our own Knowledge of the Portuguese And their reputation The ships must be preparing To attack us How do we know? Order horses and guards to be made ready Ready?! To go where? Sir If the Portuguese are going to attack We must inform the King of Hormuz immediately Shall I prepare myself to accompany you? No You will stay here But sir Don't argue with me, Hormuzi We must get there quickly And besides, I need to leave someone in town to represent me And I will not find one better than you for this task What are they doing here, Dad? We don't know yet Give the signal I want the commanders to catch up with us before sunset I'm worried about the way the ships are hardly moving Given the attempt to sink the Sanbuk I think they will attack us Do you think that the Khorfakkan garrison Will be able to hold them off? Look, Abdullah Our walls and gates were built to protect us from the mountains Not from an attack from the sea In truth, Abu Ali I don't think the garrison will be what holds them off But our faith in God above And our determination Are all we have now With all due respect to you, Commander We are but two days away from our intended objective, Hormuz We should not be thinking about invading... Who are you to dare to stand in the way of Albuquerque? The great Hormuz, And all enemies of the church Will bow to the will of our great leader My nephew has calming way with words, but He often speaks the truth De Campo We are emissaries of King Manuel the first As such our presence must embody the strength of his empire Our King Manuel goes wherever he pleases Let this be known to all Move it He thinks himself a king Yet he reigns over 6 worm-eaten ships Rotten equipment, and scarce supplies And hundreds of starving men Of bad temper This will not end well What are you doing? Are you crazy? Back off What is going on? What are you two doing? As you see I see a white flag! Abu Ali The Portuguese fired on the fishermen How long before they attack the town? We have no choice but to surrender, before they kill us all Coward! Shut up Calm down Zaid Calm down This is not how compatriots talk! And you Come Calm down Calm down Didn't you hear what he said? I did But what you did Can not be ignored either I do what I do it to protect my family, my livelihood We can't tell how many soldiers are on those ships Whatever the case is What gives you two the right To decide the fate of the entire town? We will only prevail if we unite If you and your friend go to them now What stops them from killing you Get rid of the flag Come on The man has a point What do you mean? We Indians have seen What the Portuguese do, wherever they go They are ruthless, and show no mercy to young or old alike And they have weapons that you do not have They will not quit the war path Until they control every trade route From their own country, to India And they care nothing for those in the middle Look Look Look at their ships Can a small town like Khorfakkan, Stop an army like that? The governor is getting ready to leave As I expected Get ready Peace and mercy of God be upon you Peace and mercy of God be upon you, too How are you, Haj? I'm tired, with a lot of unanswered questions, Umm Ali But praise be to God This is how it goes when one reaches my age Umm Ali When did you get here? Ali, go home But, perhaps… Ali Obey your mother Ali, Obedience to parents Is obedience to God, my son Come on. Come with me Why don't you take the kids and leave with the others? I won't lie and say I am not afraid But I will not run I will stay, with the people of this town If the attack comes Myself and other women will stand by our town As I expected from you Have the crew load the boat with everything we have left ashore Leave nothing behind Go now and see to it. Go Mohieddin, Are you and Kumar planning to escape? We have no choice but save ourselves and our trade, Yousef You and your crew would be a real help to defend the town I'm sorry, Yousef I have seen the Portuguese first hand And heard enough about them to be certain That the people of Khorfakkan will not stop them So what should we do? Run away? I'll tell you my advice again If you can convince them to guarantee the safety of the townspeople and their livelihoods Do not hesitate to do so Surrender? Just like that? Without a fight? I am just a merchant, Yousef I am no expert in war Mohieddin We can't be late We need the cover of dark to hide us from the Portuguese Won't you change your mind, sir, and take me with you? For the last time I tell you Who will represent me, while I am away? The townspeople need someone they can depend on Hormuzi I trust no one more than you Do not bring this up again And see to your duty Hormuzi Try what you can to delay their attack Until I return with help Fortunately for us, the moon is full tonight True Tonight is the night Of the fourteenth of Jumada Al Ula, 913 Anno Hegirae It will forever be etched in memory Do you expect the worst? We can do nothing now, but to pray to God to protect Khorfakkan and its people Sir A movement at sea, Sir What kind of movement? I can't quite tell Well Take some soldiers Take a boat, and go and find out what it is I don't want a single one of their boats to leave town tonight. Go Very well It is safest to move anyone who can't fight to outside the walls Children, women, the elderly Saleh is right But, not everyone wants to leave Now is not the time Abu Ali, to accommodate each person's want We must stand together If we force people to go against their will, We risk dividing the town You may be right But we have to be rational and patient as we do not know our enemy's plan Leaving the vulnerable in town is a huge risk Leaving town might be a risk even greater The road to the mountains is tough going for children and the elderly If we send them towards the mountains The Portuguese may circle around the town And find them Where it will be easier to capture or kill them Yousef is right As for those who left today They have enough time to reach a safe place Perhaps some of them Will manage to tell our brothers and neighbours in the neighbouring villages And they might come to our aid For those who have chosen to stay Will not have time to find a safe hiding place Then we let them be targets for the Portuguese, Father? No We find them safe sanctuary within the town itself And distribute them to the remote houses and the mosque Our strength Stems from the fact that the town is our own We know every inch of it We must use this advantage To save lives, and defend our home We found nothing, sir Even the shore where the people had gathered Was deserted They must have fled Listen Inform the commanders Pass the order to ready their men for sunrise When they hear the drums played in sequence They and their men must be ready Go to it Dear Lord, this our situation, is known well by you Preserve Khorfakkan and its people, O Most Merciful Move it Unload the boats Hurry up!

Move it Retreat Get out of here and I'll catch up with you Stand Get ready to fire Take aim Bring up the cannons Move Abu Ali Your wound looks serious Let me help you Fire Open fire There's no point Abu Ali But Yousef? Do not think of those slain in the cause of Allah as dead Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision Almighty God has spoken truly Forward guys. Come on What are you waiting for? Give chase and kill them. Go What a shame You are standing here, my nephew, And your men are fighting alone Join them Right away, commander Move! Siege the entrances to the mosque. Hurry up Tie them all up And take them away to the town If any of them resists, kill him Dom Antonio Sir Search every single place we haven't set foot in Gather everyone you find And take them to the mosque Right away, sir Let's go You watch the road I am going to check on Abu Ali Thank God Praise be to God We are already far away from the town, sir Send out a scout to sound the alarm if they get any closer to town Come on Hurry up Abu Ali Welcome We came to help As soon as we heard of the attack And there are many other warriors coming You are very welcome You are true brothers and good neighbors Just doing our duty God bless you all But Can any of you help our compatriot? He's badly wounded Ahmed Chop of their noses and cut off their ears Bring me the rest What? Something to say De Campo? Come on Sir, I found this man hiding in the Governor's house The Governor's House? Are you the Governor? No, sir I swear to you that I am not the Governor I am merely an aide You are from Hormuz? Yes, sir, yes I see He could not be more ugly Even if we did chop off his nose No, sir Please, have mercy Mercy? The likes of you do not deserve mercy Do you agree? Sir, Why would a glorious leader like you, As exalted as Alexander the Great Want to hurt a poor man like me? He also knows of Alexander? Of course, sir I see him when I look at you What do you have in your hand? I brought this book about Alexander with me A gift For the Great Commander Albuquerque It is a priceless book, sir Written in Persian It is a masterpiece The great leader Can add it To his treasures Why should I pardon you? I am aware, sir That your goal Is to reach Hormuz I know it very well If you would allow me I could accompany you And tell you everything you need to know I have no need for the likes of you But, I will let you go Tell me your name Mahmud, Mahmud Al Hormuzi Warning shots, sir The lookouts on the boats Have sounded the alarm Take everything valuable Shackle the able-bodied men and bring them to serve on the fleet Then burn down the houses Get on with it Untie the women and children But, let no one out Move out and head to the boats Come on, quickly Easy, Ali, Slowly I am wounded Father May God have mercy on our martyrs Take solace in the living We have forced them back, though for a while If you have something to say, speak I have nothing to say But, I wonder What have we gained from all this? The King trusted me When he commissioned me, to conquer, Rule And defend his vast earthly kingdom I know how to best to dominate Thanks to my years Wisdom, patience And vast knowledge De Campo Let me show you something that will do you good Terrorism Is the greatest weapon in war Remember this very well, and always So you may succeed Yes, sir It is time to return to my ship Is this playtime son? We've got work to finish I just do my job, Father If my little boat reaches The end of the canal Then I know that the water That carried it, has reached all our crops Work and play together Beware that the box comes into contact with water Do you understand what I'm saying? What is the name of your brother? Abdullah Dear brother I miss you So much Commander Omar Always an honour to see you Hello merchant Ismail O Commander, I guarantee these weapons and ammunition Are bone dry God willing, my ship is watertight It is not a matter of doubting you Or what you bring with you, Ismail This goes to the heart of the safety of our young men We do not want to lose a single one of them To damp gunpowder or weapons Here is the price of the weapons Three golden Ashrafi dinars Ali always hits the bullseye Unlike you, Rashid You couldn't hit a target Even if it's before your nose No, even if the target Is hung on your nose Enough Stop bickering the pair of you It doesn't matter who's best What do you reckon? They're improving But... But, they still need more practice Let's hope peace Holds a great while longer Indeed But, we must be prepared for anything Peace be upon you Mohamed Peace and mercy be upon you, too Where have you come from? What news Mohamed? I'll have to catch up later Right now, I need to talk to the town council. Urgently Do you remember, Haj Mahmoud and Ahmed were also with me Peace be upon you Mohamed Peace be upon you, too How are you, Father? Mohamed How are you? Praise be to God Mohamed What's wrong, my friend? I've been sailing non-stop To get here in a matter of utmost haste What's wrong, son? I bring bad news From Hormuz Khorfakkan is no longer under the command of Hormuz As it used to be After its trade has flourished You must do something, Your Majesty Trade with Hromuz is in decline Thanks to Khorfakkan's underhand Theft of our rightful share of business And now The traders of India And beyond Prefer to take what they have To Khorfakkan Instead of coming to us And by doing so, they are transforming it To the gate of The Arabian Peninsula Worse still, Your Majesty, If they start to incite their neighbors On the island and on the coast What if every town can be independent With its finances and trade? Where will we get money from to pay the King of Portugal? Things aggravate, Your Majesty When they attacked the ships heading towards us I knew this from men whom I trust With eyes and ears in the court of the King of Hormuz We don't doubt what you say, Mohamed Carry on Then the counselors Began filling the king's head with lies Painting a complete fabrication They've even come to, Your Majesty To attack the ships heading towards our ports To the extent that the owners of these ships Became afraid to send their ships anywhere near us The people of Khorfakkan send those who attack ships In order to threaten our trade and destabilize our security You sit around eating and drinking But could you even tell me? The name of their leader He goes by the name Haj Suleiman He is still the one who has the last word In the town council Despite his age Your Majesty António da Silveira is at the door Finally Let him in right away Your Majesty. I want to… Commander da Silveira Khorfakkan has been out of my control for too long Although 27 years have passed since the last Portuguese's attack I see no evidence of you trying to bring it back under my authority Anyway I have learnt that a ship would sail in a few days So I decided to send a letter to His Majesty King Joao III of Portugal I did not mention in it my desire to retake Khorfakkan Nor did I mention your interest in the matter I leave this matter To you, Antonio Scribe The Sultan, victorious in rule and felicity Long may you rule over your sultanate and kingdom The very Sun and Moon of power and glory, And the Sultan of the people Your excellency's Devoted ally Extends to you His utmost devotion and humility Hoping the perpetuity of your rule And the vitality of your valour and greatness I shall be brief For I want to make clear My great degree of devotion to you Muhammad Shah Ibn Abi Nasr Shah King of Hormuz Your Majesty. May I speak to you in private? Chamberlain Clear the court I know you were fed up with Khorfakkan and its revolt And I could not ignore your request, which you've mentioned several times before And so I wrote to His Majesty the King of Portugal To ask for permission to invade Khorfakkan again And bring it under our authority It is my pleasure to inform your Majesty That two days ago On a day all our memories will record February 13th Of this year 1534 I received a reply from his majesty Instructing me to start the campaign against Khorfakkan And I have already started preparing for this campaign Spearheaded by our main vessel, a Galliot With two Fustas Loaded with 200 soldiers Armed with rifles This is exactly what I would have liked to hear How long till you can begin the invasion? Preparations are almost complete, Your Majesty Who will lead this mission? Don George de Castro He is one of the highest regarded And favored leaders of the king Let me assure you It is the will of our King Joao III that Khorfakkan once again bow To our control At any cost I saw the Portuguese military preparations myself As I departed Hormuz We must ask Commander Omar To join us We need to hear his opinion Come on Quickly Faster Perhaps the Portuguese will be more reasonable this time Faster Maybe if we show them our harvest is only enough to feed ourselves That they have been lied to Maybe they'll… What are you saying? These warmongers know nothing but power Haven't we all witnessed the brutality of the Portuguese? Haven't we all? Abu Ali is right We need to focus on our defenses To protect our town Commander Omar has said nothing Ahmed is right to be afraid The Portuguese could easily annihilate our little garrison Except we Can find many ways To face an enemy that far outnumbers us and is better armed Thanks to Mohamed We have learned when to expect their attack We can use this time To choose its place Yes Yes As long as we are sure We have enough time We must clear The town Of women and children If we could hide them somewhere safe in the mountains Before the Portuguese attack We eliminate The Portuguese from using them against us And we'll be braver when we face them on the field Abdullah This must be announced in the market We'll do it, Haj As for me, I will choose someone to watch from the hilltop So that the Portuguese do not take us by surprise Yes Yes What kind of army will we be facing in Khorfakkan? Are they able fighters? It is a small town With no army Even so. I've heard the whole town will come out to fight us Even the women and children? I heard that these Arabs are ruthless I was your age now When we first invaded Khorfakkan Under the command of Afonso Albuquerque We anchored off the coast at night At dawn Afonso aimed our cannons towards the town And our soldiers followed their orders And killed everyone who resisted We did not discriminate between man or woman Grandmothers or children Not even the sick Nothing remained in the village but memories There were no military hardened soldiers among them We faced only simple townsfolk In the end We burned their town to the ground Do not fear anything In no more than a week And you will return to your families As heroes O people of Khorfakkan O people of Khorfakkan We have learned That ships Carrying Portuguese soldiers Are sailing towards us From Hormuz As far as we know They do not come in peace Instead they have one purpose. To take our town from us Listen to me! I know that Many of you Still remember what happened years ago But, do not fear Do not be alarmed This time, they will not take us by surprise, thank God The council has decided To evacuate the town Of everyone who cannot fight This is Abdullah, Abu Ali You all know him And have faith in him He is responsible for evacuating the town Do not take much Bring only what you can carry We must get you out of the town to where you can be safe Before the Portuguese arrive And do not be afraid Fear not for your home Khorfakkan men Along with my son, Ali Will sacrifice their lives for it Let us pray to Allah to help them achieve victory Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs The wind is favorable I predict we reach Khorfakkan In four days Stand by Load your weapons, move it Get ready Fire The merchant ships are leaving Do you blame them? I don't think anyone would expect them to be here when the Portuguese arrive Our boys have been trained with rifles We will face them on more equal terms this time, God willing Peace be upon you Peace be upon you, too I really wish I could believe you, Abu Ali I really wish I could believe you Why don't you All I see them destroying our newly rebuilt town again But Ahmed... They only bring chaos and destruction It'll be different this time, God willing I was a kid when the Portuguese first attacked us But I will not forget what I saw that day as long as I live I thought I would lose my father I thank God I did not It is true that the Portuguese were able to burn down our town that day But now we are stronger and able to hold them back. God willing We have a solid plan And are well prepared The Portuguese Are hardened And determined warriors They are better armed So are we We are well trained and ready You were trained with sticks And you fire at dummies That do not move This will not be enough To drive off their army This is what they've done to us! If there is anyone among us Who has forgotten or is ignorant Take a good look at me And know that those we face Are without mercy If they have no mercy We have no fear Its been quiet and calm the last two days Perfect weather for a sail You can not trust the weather at sea in winter time Why all this pessimism, Alexio? Maybe its my wise old head I'm not youthful like yourself This here Is their weak spot We will only get one chance to attack We must move fast without hesitation Or else We lose the element of surprise, and we'll lose Do you understand me? Yes I will tell the men Here is where we set up the bottleneck Well Let's start Ali I came to see you Before I go to take the townspeople to the hideaway I wish I way staying But, this is what the council decided for me Don't worry about me, Father You defended the town fearlessly the first time This is my chance to follow in your footsteps Take care of yourself Father This northern wind prevents them from approaching Perhaps We won't have to face them in battle after all Don't say that! Hurry up Row! Go on rowing! Go on rowing! Pull. Come on pull Faster. Pull Come on. Come on Come on Come on. Pull Come on. Pull, pull Come on. Pull, pull Come on. Faster. Pull Faster. Pull Come on. Faster Come on. Come on Pull. Come on Come on. Come on Pull. Come on The storm is getting worse at sea No storm lasts forever We all know they will come to Khorfakkan When the wind drops There is no doubt about that Were it not for their persistence, They would not have been able to reach all of those lands How long are they going to make us wait? Even if it lasts for months, even years, I will be on the awaiting I wonder if we should have Evacuated with the rest of the town How dare you say that?! You have let the waiting dishearten you And quench your fire We are not here, only to protect ourselves and our families We are here to defend Khorfakkan itself Now, and for all time We will fight so that one day We may look into the eyes of our children and grandchildren And when they ask us what we did to protect our homeland We will say to them, we fought without fear To defend the land in which we live Faster. Pull Come on guys Come on. Row Come on Go on rowing. Go on rowing Go on rowing Come on. Row Go on rowing. Come on Come on Go on rowing Go on rowing. Faster Faster Go on rowing. Faster Perhaps the storm pushed them South Perhaps They won't make it to Kohrfakkan They will not be beaten by a storm We brought gunpowder for your muskets Make sure you keep it dry Careful The day of battle is finally coming The storm has passed We must repair the ships immediately And then Do what we came to do Where are we? The storm blew us off course But I think I'll be able to know Our position And get us back on target Some sailors are wondering Wouldn't it be better To return to Hormuz to repair the ships? We will not go back to Hormuz empty-handed! We were ordered to take Khorfakkan and we shall do so The storm has passed Go to your sailors And order them to do what they could To get to Khorfakkan As soon as possible Come on! Come on! Battle is upon us Show no mercy for those who resist Take the town in the name of our King Joao III Ahead Ahead Do you all have a weapon, or anything else you need? Yes Do not attack until you hear the signal Do not allow the Portuguese to surround us Go to your positions The town is completely empty Do you think they fled to the mountains? How dare you? Why are you two fighting? He drank the last of the water I barely wet my lips How much water do we have? One skin sir Let everyone return to their places and works You two If you go back to quarrel, I will order you be lashed! But, Don George The men have become too weak to fight It's a matter of days before they lose their heads They are exhausted from the storm and weak for lack of food You know what fate will befall us, if we don't follow the King's orders No I will not return to Hormuz Till I have taken Khorfakkan This is not up for debate Hey You What's your name? Hamza This man is a regular visitor to Khorfakkan And he knows its entrances and suburbs It is a great honor to be at your service Don George Thirst is killing my men Do you know of any sources of water nearby? Yes A near spring to the West At the foot of the mountain The men need water to get back their fighting strength Okay Send a 100 soldiers with their weapons To guard those who will bring the water to the ships Where are they going? Have they seen us? They can't see us Perhaps they're trying to surround us Ali! What is it? The first time we saw the Portuguese Was around twenty days ago This means that they stayed in the sea, struggling with the storm, And their food and water supplies were more likely to run out I have no doubt That they are looking for water And the closest spring is the one at the foot of the mountain Just as I told you Remain alert Water Keep your guard up Where is Gasper? Where is Gasper? Gasper! Draw your weapons silently Alarm Maintain your defense Come on, quickly It is an attack We've got to return to the boats Now Come on, men, to the boats, quickly Forward, at the double Take cover on the beach Ali, Ali, Ali I got wounded Wait! Since when do we murder our prisoners? Since when do we murder our prisoners? Take them away and lock them up securely If there is a wounded among them, treat him Ali Ali Let him be I knew he wouldn't treat them, as he had been treated We are not like them We captured 50 of them And killed 42 And 8 managed to escape There's no sense treating some of these prisoners Their wounds are far too serious Looks like we'll lose another couple tonight of the wounded prisoners On top of the eight we'velost already Hello Fisherman Looks like you have some fresh fish there Where do you plan to sell it?
