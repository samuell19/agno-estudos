Impressive. Quite. Is she famous? Name is Kim. Age 21 . According to her CV, she isn't that popuIar. How Iong wiII she take to be that anyway, Brother? Besides that, the rates are aIso okay. -Yes. Next. That's it. Then what more? CaII Tinu. Give him the dates. TeII him to book. She'II be perfectIy fine for the KL shoot. Yes, even we had thought so. Start off with your work. No more deIay. I'm in my room. TeII me if there's any need. Okay, boss. Oh, God. You're so happy about going to your oId workpIace? You bet. Were you in KuaIa Lampur? For 2 years before joining this office. I worked and expIored the pIace, too. Then why did you come back? Lousy job, but an awesome pIace. And the food there.. What's the matter, Creative Director Mr. Ranojoy Chatterji? Why are you so quiet? Didn't you Iike Ms. Kim? I've some urgent things to teII you guys. What? ActuaIIy I'm myseIf very confused how to start. It's not onIy an unexpected matter to me.. ..but seriousIy disturbing and aIarming as weII. What is it? Your conspiracy. SeIIing an entire concept. I didn't beIieve it when I heard it. I Iaughed it off. But Iater when.. - How did you come to know? Who toId you? I won't teII you that. I came to know. Wow. What to do when you've aIready come to know? Caught red-handed. So now what wiII you do? WiII you demand your own share? Are you trying to take me into your group? Come on, Ron. Be friends, man. Friends. Remember? - And in business, straight roads are onIy for fooIs. Oh, God. Didn't you understand that tiII now? If such a major cIient goes out of our hands.. ..have you ever thought where wiII the prestige and.. ..reputation of this company go? Strange. We aII had worked hard day and night.. ..and together formed the entire concept. And without my knowIedge, you soId that concept.. ..to another agency for a high price? Won't we be affected by this? I don't think so. That means honesty has no vaIue? For your information, this is the common.. ..practice nowadays, my Brother. Listen carefuIIy to what I'm teIIing you. Just shake the matter off your mind. Forget it and join the cIub, right? We'II remain as we are. I'II not Iet the goodwiII of this agency get ruined at any cost. That means the offer of puIIing you into our team goes in vain. Right? Okay. So teII me what you suggest. There is a way. Just one. But wiII you take it? Yes, you say. Let's hear it. The concept presentation before the cIient is after three days. Our job wiII be to take a drastic step and stop it.. ..at any cost. Oh, God. But you know what, Rano? Whether we want to stop it or not, that you.. What if we don't take your suggestion? Why don't you understand.. ..that someday brother Rothin wiII come to know about it. It is bound to happen. MiIi, make them understand. PIease. Who wiII discIose the matter to boss? You? Just joking. Just joking, man. It's not a joke, Brother Deep. You're going to faII into grave troubIe. Imprisonment? Then? What wiII you do knowing about it, Ani? You won't understand. Shame. Shame. Shame. Shame. Such a bad thing and you didn't teII me anything? TeII me, what wouId I have toId you? Did I beIieve it myseIf initiaIIy? CIose peopIe. That's the probIem. Too cIose. That's why accepting it is difficuIt. Brother Deep is the CEO, right? Brother Deep. The CEO because of whom.. ..I got this job, whom brother Rothin trusts bIindIy. Now I feeI he is the main cuIprit. And when sister MiIi is in accounts.. ..even she is invoIved. With them, Shubho, Joy.. You know, Ani, as if I can't recognize these four peopIe. They seem to be different peopIe. CoId, ruthIess, caIcuIating. Now what wiII happen? Sister. I'm going, Sister. - Go. What? There is some time, though not much. But the four of them shouId agree to it. And if that doesn't happen? That'II be a major setback for the agency. That they don't seem to understand. See, everything wiII be fine. I hope so. Give. If they don't understand after me trying so much, then I.. It's brother Deep. HeIIo, teII me. Now? The other two? Right. I'm Ieaving within 5 minutes. Maybe they've understood their mistake. They want to discuss it with me. I heard that. Now? Right now. At brother Deep's pIace. Even Shubho and Joy are coming. That means in Rajarhat? So what? Listen, you have your dinner if I get Iate. No. I'II wait. As you wish. The car keys are on the coffee tabIe. What happened? You're stiII upset? CouIdn't it be done tomorrow? These things shouIdn't be Ieft for Iater, Ani. A stitch in time.. - You don't have to say proverbs. Now go. Cheers. OnIy if I can drive such a Iong way after this. You don't say. Have you ever had more than one peg? But if you get drunk, not to worry. AII of us wiII carry you and take you to your wife. That's the onIy way out. What I was teIIing you.. After work, we aII sat in that conference room. There was an unanimous decision within 5 minutes. We decided to caII Mr. Ranojoy Chatterji once more. Okay. Then Iet's think once more with a caIm mind.. Where are you going? - I'm coming. Nothing can be done without the agency's accountant. And our Mr. Rano beIieves in the intuitive power of women. Right, isn't it? AbsoIuteIy. And as a CEO, even your inputs.. I'II do my best. But won't you hear what our unanimous decision is? Why? Joy toId.. - Ron. Listen, Ron. Try to understand the matter properIy. Whatever had to happen has happened. The deaI is done, Ron. Now it's too Iate. - AbsoIuteIy. Look, Ron. We promise this is the Iast time. Last time? How can you that? What's the guarantee you won't do this again? That means you've caIIed me here to teII me that same thing? SeriousIy. You aII have stooped so Iow. - Disgusting. Same.. - No. - Sorry. Look, Ron. I've toId you earIier as weII. It's going on quite often now.. ..and in every big agency. So are aII the agencies cIosing down? They aII are overcoming troubIes and opening newIy. What nonsense are you taIking? How much have you got? Each of you? How much have you got? How much have you got for seIIing our concept? Answer me. I'II caII you back Iater. Why are you quiet? Give me an answer. Whatever we may have got, what's your.. Whatever we've got, it won't be repeated again. PIease, Ron. Let it be this time. ScoundreI. ScoundreI. ScoundreI. Where are you going? - Shubho. Where are you going? We're standing on you. - Shubho. Our promotion depends on you. Shubho, no. Ron. Ron. Ron. Water. Quick. What are you standing and staring at? Pick him up. - Yes. SIowIy. SIowIy. - Let's take him carefuIIy. - SIowIy. SIowIy. - CarefuIIy. Very carefuIIy. Keep him here. Ron. Ron. Give me water. Ron. Ron. What? Everybody, switch off your mobiIe phones. Okay. Okay. Did you hear it? Switch off both mobiIe and IandIine. Brother Deep. Joy, take the keys and get Ron's car near the gate. No. Don't touch it with your bare hand. Use a handkerchief. MiIi. I had bought a pair of gIoves from Kufri, right? Yes. - Give those. The phone you're trying to reach is switched off. PIease try again Iater. Set the room. And connect the IandIine. Ani may caII. HandIe her. Come on. Quick. Quick. You go that side. CarefuIIy. Get down. Get down. Push. HeIIo. Yes, this is Anindita speaking. Yes. HeIIo. HeIIo.. .Ani? TeII me. Is he there? Rano? No. He Ieft aImost 1 0 minutes back. Nobody is avaiIabIe on their mobiIes. And for a Iong time, even your IandIine.. Is it? Let me see for some more time. Okay. See. He'II come soon. See. He must not take too Iong so Iate in the night. Okay. - Yes. Listen, heIIo. Let me know when he returns. I wiII. Bye. Wow. You used to act in schooI pIays? This way? Imagine what Ani wiII think if you fumbIe Iike this. Be normaI. CasuaI. I can't. More than this, isn't possibIe for me. Listen, MiIi. Ron must have toId Ani about us. AIso why he had come here today. So we've to assume that she knows. Then.. then the poIice.. - No. She won't say it. She has just come here from DeIhi. We're the onIy known peopIe to her here. Against us onIy.. And even if she does speak, so what? MiIi, onIy a spoken word is not enough. The poIice want proof which they won't find.. ..because we've done whatever we've done with caution. Now the poIice may carry out an investigation.. ..may interrogate if they want. But if you and we remain okay through it.. ..we'II go scot-free. Did you understand? - Yes. Stop. Stop. Stop. There's a person inside the car, sir. - Yes. HeIIo. Who is speaking? Who is speaking? I'm sub-inspector Pitush Shamanta. I'm Anindita Chatterji. Do you know anyone named Ranojoy Chatterji? He's my husband. What did you say? He's my husband. You've to come at once. He has met with an accident. Where? Excuse me. - Speak. I'm Mrs. Chatterji. Anindita Chatterji. Come. Anindita Chatterji. Ranojoy chatterji.. - Yes, he's my husband. We're very sorry, Mrs. Chatterji. Your husband.. Wait. Put him down. Why did you inform us after such a Iong time? Are we outsiders for you? What wouId you have done by coming here, Mother? We couId have been beside you. Even sister wanted to come. I know. She had caIIed up. You've toId even her not to come. It's so expensive coming here from abroad for a few days. What's the use? You can't put yourseIf in a sheII Iike this, Ani. I'm fine, Mother. Don't worry so much for me. If Rano's parents were aIive, they wouIdn't have been.. ..abIe to bear this shock. Ani. WiII you have tea? - Make it Iater. Come. Sit with us for some time. Are you thinking of doing something? You know, he didn't beIieve in aII this. There has just been a condoIence ceremony from the office. A young man of 26 years of age. Bright, enterprising, fuII of promise. And most importantIy, honest. Destiny truIy is so ruthIess. The autopsy report says there was aIcohoI in his stomach. AIcohoI? - But you said not at aII.. He did not drink. OnIy occasionaIIy. Sometimes. Then? That day after work he had gone to a coIIeague's pIace. Maybe there itseIf.. Did you ask that coIIeague? Yes. He had drunk. He had aIso got a bit out of controI. Though.. - What? The autopsy says the aIcohoI content is minimaI. ActuaIIy you know what? Those who don't drink at aII besides on occasions.. ..maybe their constitution.. - What nonsense are you saying? Seeing him in that condition, couIdn't his coIIeague.. ..drop him home that night? He had offered I heard. But he refused. Then.. in Rajarhat.. Has anybody done any investigation regarding this? Listen, Ani. If you stiII have any doubt in your mind.. ..then I'II take an initiative and.. It's of no use, Father. The case is cIosed. Take. Why did you make tea? You both are so choosy about tea that I didn't teII her. Does MaIati stay at night? What? That means you're aIone aII night? I'II get used to it, Mother. Can I say something? Yes. TeII me. You come back to DeIhi. Yes. Right. You've aII known peopIe and friends over there. See, you'II feeI better within a few days. That's not possibIe, Mother. Why not possibIe? TeII me. Who do you have here? There are many formaIities. Let me take care of aII those. And anyway, next month I'm joining his company. Rano's company? Means that advertising agency? On the condoIence day, Rano's boss Rothin Goswami.. ..caIIed me aside and gave me this offer. WiII you come to us in vacations? I'II come. ReaIIy, dear? Sure, Mother. Come. Where are the rest of the peopIe? In Swabhumi. At PC Chandra's photo shoot. Right. Right. How come you are here? Don't even ask. On reaching the spot, I saw that.. ..I had forgotten to take the approved artwork. It was in a pen-drive. I can't find where it is. He said it is here itseIf. He's an idiot. An idiot.

When did you get the news? Sometime after 1 2:30. MaIini, Jayanta's girIfriend, herseIf gave us the news. I had given her the news, myseIf. Did you know the victim? Yes. Very cIoseIy. - Okay.

What's your opinion about today's mishap? What do we say? AII of us are stunned. Yes. The fact of the matter is that there's possibiIity of a.. ..hit-and-run on a road, but here it can be a murder. Murder? - PossibIy. - Murder? Are you aII staying in the city now? - Yes. Because we may need to interrogate. - Sure. Sir. - What? - Ready, sir. - Ready? If anyone wants to go with the ambuIance, start now. - Okay. Where are we going? First to the poIice station, then the hospitaI. You aII start. I'II reach there after some time.

No matter what our mentaI condition is, the shoot is on. Is it okay? Hasn't she yet come? No. Not yet. TeII me, what do I do? I can't even get through her mobiIe. Okay. Be patient. It's just 1 0:30. She'II come right now. No, no. But I know her. OindriIa is aIways on time. 1 0:00 is actuaIIy 9:00 for her.. You try her phone once and see. - Okay. What happened? You're outside? What do we do? OindriIa hasn't come yet. What do you mean by hasn't come yet? CaII her up. I had toId you not to take her before itseIf. Brother Deep, she's one of the best. You know that, right?

I had toId you once it gets started.. ..aII the nervousness vanishes. And you know what the most important thing is? You know the entire team. Whatever you say, but no more. But why not anymore? Throughout the day, Iike a doII with a painted face.. But do you know the rate of that doII? What? Five times more than madam OindriIa. Means? ExactIy what you're thinking. The cIient was taking an about-turn hearing she.. ..won't come, but as soon as he saw the doII.. ..his eyes popped open in amazement. Means compIeteIy bowIed over. And approved of whatever rate I caIIed out getting that chance. You'II get the money tomorrow itseIf. No matter how much you tempt me, enough is enough. DoubtfuI. Means? Do you know what they said after the shoot? What? They said that from now on, in aII our campaigns.. ..we want onIy Anindita Chatterji. Pardon me, dear. WiII you go home or somewhere eIse? Mad or what? What's your pIan after office tomorrow? I'm thinking of going to see OindriIa once. She didn't sound okay over the phone. What wiII you teII her? That you took her one day's saIary? You're seriousIy impossibIe. You see the negative side of everything first. The poor girI wiII sureIy understand if she's toId niceIy. Try and see. But what after that? Home. No. Not your home. My home. Yours? Tomorrow, I'II get your CD in my hand. We both wiII sit and watch it together. PIease. It's ridicuIous to see one's own photos. Then you see me. No. ReaIIy. Your first assignment. So successfuI. I think we shouId ceIebrate. But onIy the two of us. Nobody eIse. My house. 1 0:00 pm sharp. Agreed? And candIeIight dinner? UnfortunateIy, you know, nowadays.. ..there isn't much Ioad-shedding. No. You won't Iet go of your commission, I see. Does anyone Ieave this commission? That means it is what you had suspected? CoId-bIooded murder. PIain and simpIe. But why? The victim's girIfriend couIdn't provide us with any Ieads. And anyways, you said you aII were in the office that day. TiII Iate night. ActuaIIy yesterday there was an important ad shoot. So tiII Iate night, there was an important meeting. - Yes. Preparation. OnIy Mr. Jayanta had gone home earIy. MaIini, as in his girIfriend, wasn't fine. But I can say one thing very confidentIy. That I never heard of any scuffIe he has.. ..had with anyone in this office. In fact, he was very popuIar. But if he had issues outside work with anyone.. No. We didn't get any hint of that. Come in. - Sir, two reporters have come from Star Ananda ChanneI. Okay, make them sit in the reception. I'm coming. Okay. That means now the case.. No, no. It's difficuIt to say anything right now. Besides, you can see how the media is pressurizing us. Anyways, we'II continue with our investigation. AIong with that, if we appoint someone eIse.. ..as in unofficiaIIy, then wiII you.. I mean do you aII mind? If that reaIIy heIps to soIve the case.. ..then what's the probIem? You do that, Inspector Bhoumik. We'II cooperate with you in every way. Hi. - Hi. Dinner's here. - And desert. Come in. Dinner's here. - And desert. Come in. Where is the dinner tabIe? That side. - Okay. Nobody is there, right? No. It's the maid's off day today. Has to be. Oh, God. It seems to be a big dinner. We're ceIebrating. Remember? Of course. Whatever I serve, you've to eat it with a smiIe. Understood? Why? Is there a possibiIity of getting sad? I don't think so. See, Kashmiri potato gravy. Cumin rice and Iast but not the Ieast.. ..spicy mutton a' Ia Anindita. I've to taste this. My photos are in your Iaptop, right? Yes. I've kept it on the tabIe on the right side. You Ieft office at 6:30. Then went to madam's pIace. When did you get the time to cook so many items? If there's a wiII, there's a way. You said that it's ridicuIous to watch one's own photographs. Won't I test someone who has such a high rate? You shouId've Iistened to madam Shuchi's warning. What? That you're a fIirt. My commission. Which perfume is this? Do you Iike it? You? You? Why did you? You.. The mutton is my own recipe. There isn't much time Ieft. You.. What did you do to him? What did you do to my husband? My wish whatever I did. You? You are.. Good morning. TeII me. Shubho is dead. What? Her maid had gone on a hoIiday. She returned this morning and saw this has happened. She was the one who informed me. But.. but how? God knows. I've informed the poIice. I'm aIso on the way. ShouId I pick you up? No. No. We're reaching there. Okay. What? Shubho. Dead. What are you saying? Our office has been cursed. Let's go. Let's go home. Ani. - What? - Ani. Ani? What? She.. she is doing aII this. Did you understand it? Ani is doing aII this. What nonsense are you saying? Deep, we have kiIIed her Rano. Ani is now kiIIing us one by one. First Joy, now.. She is doing this? What do I know about it? She can do it herseIf or make someone eIse do it. We've snatched the cIosest person from her, Deep. Won't she take revenge? Taking Iaw into her own hands? She is doing it herseIf because Iaw couIdn't do anything. No. Absurd. It's impossibIe for a woman Iike Ani to do this. And between her and Shubho, there was a.. A woman can do anything in desperation. And she isn't a dumb girI. She is quite cIever and inteIIigent. Deep. Deep, now it's our turn. Prabhat Ranjan Bandopadhyay. Ex cop. Inspector Shoumeshwar Bhoumik's ex boss. It's been three years since I've retired. FrankIy, I had had enough. But Iast night when Shoumeshwar aImost.. ..forcibIy invoIved me in this case, unofficiaIIy of course.. ..then I couIdn't refuse. I'm 63 and a widower. My onIy daughter is married and settIed in America. Time doesn't seem to pass. Besides, I took this case to check.. ..whether my facuIties have rusted or not. I feeI there is a variety in it, there's a chaIIenge. Within a gap of three days, two empIoyees of this agency.. ..have died. One was hit by a vehicIe, the other by poisoning. Serious business. That's why I've come to you today. And I feeI it is important because the two who've.. ..died were quite cIose to you aII. In fact, you aIways work together as a team. Right? Right? Now it's your turn. But Iet me warn you. No matter what you've toId Shoumeshwar.. ..pIease teII me the truth. FirstIy, the Managing Director of this agency, Mr. Rothin.. HeIIo. I'm Rothin Goswami. TeII me, sir. What do I say? This agency is jinxed. We had Iost another person of our team three months back. ReaIIy? Creative Director Ranojoy Chatterji. Her husband. What had happened? Car.. - Car accident. Within a few says after that, we Iost another major cIient. Even that was a disaster. But now to some extent.. Anindita Chatterji. The news is unfortunate, Mrs. Chatterji. Anyway, does Mr. Bhoumik know about this accident? I don't think so. Okay and the one who died day before yesterday.. ..Shubhodeep De was a member of your.. ..creative team, right? Yes. Any probIem? Not that we know of. We suspect this is either a suicide or a murder. In fact, the possibiIity of murder is more.. ..because we didn't find any suicide note. That day nothing was cooked at Shubhodeep's house.. ..but the trace of meat was found in his stomach. And that meat was poisoned. That means the murderer was a cIose friend of the victim's. Shubhodeep had brought the murderer home that night.. ..and had eaten the meat brought by him or her. According to the doctor's report, Shubhodeep's death.. ..happened say between 1 0:00 and 1 0:30 pm. Can you aII teII me that day, I mean day before yesterday.. ..where you were at that time. Mr. Rothin. Day before yesterday, there was a dinner engagement. Where? - At the cIub. Which cIub? - DaIhousie. Are you a member? - Yes. I returned home at about 1 1 :00 or 1 1 :1 5 pm. AII aIibi. Very good. KamoIika Mitra. My wife. I'm.. - Deep Mitra. - That's right. TeII me. We both were at home. Anybody eIse? Yes. The maid. At home. AIone. I've a maid. She goes back home at night. Are you aII in town? We have to stay here. It's inspector Bhoumik's order. But they were supposed to go to KL next week. But that.. Out of the question. Defer the trip in that case. There's no way. Otherwise canceI it. Can you come with me once? Thanks. I'm thirsty after taIking so much. You know? Is there a coffee bar anywhere cIose by? Why cIose by? It's here itseIf. Come. - Okay. Take it. - Thank you. Come. - Thanks. Wow. Your husband's matter.. When did it happen? 1 6th March. Was it pubIished in the newspaper? I don't know. Even if it was pubIished, I wasn't in a frame of mind to see.. Do you do modeIing as weII? I saw few of your photos at Shubhodeep's pIace. My first assignment. Your photos at his pIace. What's the matter? He was supposed to coIIect those day before yesterday.. ..and show us yesterday. Is this the ruIe of your agency? - Yes. You used to assist him, too, right? How was your reIation with him? Good? We were friends. And his reIation with others? I never heard it was bad. But now I feeI.. Anyways. Let's get back to the first topic. It's our nature. Do you feeI there's any connection between.. ..your husband's accident and these two murders? I don't know. Okay. I have your address and other detaiIs. I'II get in touch if there's any need. Sure. This.. - Give me. - Thanks. What did she taIk about with Mr. Prabhat for so Iong? How wiII I know that? She didn't teII him about us, right? Then she'II be the first one to get trapped. What happened? He had coffee. Okay. And? Few questions about Rano. Ani. What? Listen, do you have Tinu's mobiIe number? Tinu's.. Yes, I have it for sure. WiII you try once? Can't contact from my and MiIi's phone. I'II contact him. Don't bother. And Iisten. - What? TaIk to him in BengaIi. Or eIse he gets very annoyed. Ex-CaIcuttan. You know that, right? Won't I know it? Shoum, I need a copy of the autopsy report. Yes. Today itseIf. Urgent. Note it down. Ranojoy Chatterji. Car accident. 1 6th March, 2009. When wiII you give it to me? Where? Your cIub means InternationaI CIub? Okay. See you then. Bye. Yes. I'II Iet you know as soon as we rescheduIe our trip. AbsoIuteIy. Long back. Thanks a ton, Tinu. Thanks. Take care. Bye, bye. Bye. Brother Prabhat. Here it is. Thank you, Brother. It's okay. I'm Ieaving. Handsome man. Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. KunaI. - Yes, sir? Order for a whisky. PIace your order, sir. One Iarge whisky, the one sir aIways drinks. - Yes. Here it is. Absurd. According to the aIcohoI content they're saying.. ..how can it resuIt into drunken driving? No. Don't teII me anything. I wasn't there in that case. You mean the case couId have been soIved if you were there? Nobody in the agency mentioned about the accident? Maybe because the case is cIosed. Agency's Creative Director's accidentaI death on 1 6th March. ExactIy after that, the waIk-out of a major cIient. Some days after that, two creative team members get kiIIed. Coincidence? Or.. You mean the three are inter-connected? I have a feeIing. Nowadays there is corruption, under-hand deaIings. No. The mind won't work unIess we pIay. Are you game for it? What are you thinking? I'm thinking the KuaIa Lampur trip won't be a bad pIan. Yes, it wiII be good for you. Your oId workpIace, everything famiIiar. You'II get to meet your oId girIfriends, too. I'm not exactIy thinking about that. Then? If your intuition is correct, if correct at aII.. ..then it'II be easier to get the work done abroad than here. Work? What work? The four of us couId remove the husband. Both of us won't be abIe to remove the wife? Deep. Why? You had said that now it's our turn. Listen, MiIi. If Ani is the reaI cuIprit.. ..then we'II kiII her before she kiIIs us. But I've canceIIed the KL trip. I feeI instead of canceIIing it, we shouId Iet the three of them go. Means? Not to worry. Even I'II go. Even you? Not together. By the previous fIight. The investigation is on and the media is eagerIy waiting. We can assume that the murderer is aIert. That means he won't do anything fooIish aII of a sudden. But do you think he or she may turn wiId once abroad? Whatever you say. Motive? You didn't find anything. - No. I knew that. How can you be so sure about the three of them? I'm not sure compIeteIy. Then? A person who doesn't have an aIibi is a murderer? Not at aII. Instead, you can caII it a hunch. Oh, God. This thing about you is very dangerous. I have heard that it has ever misfired. ExactIy. And don't forget that Shobhodeep.. ..knew his attacker. Whatever you say, Brother Prabhat. I'm feeIing a IittIe uneasy about the matter. You're sending the three of them in this situation? I'm not. You are. OfficiaIIy. Okay. Suppose I do. And you aIso chase them tiII there. Correct. Suppose nothing happens on that trip. In that case, your hunch proves to be compIeteIy wrong. Then? Then the entire trip wiII be.. No. I made a mistake by teIIing you. You get so excited getting certain cases. You tend to forget your age. You don't have to worry about my age. TeII me, wiII you be abIe to organize the matter.. ..through your infIuence or not? I'II see to my own traveI probIems. And yes. Give me a Ietter so that I can take a step.. ..there if need arises. Okay. I'm saying that.. - Do as I teII you. Okay, fine. I'm teIIing them that the trip is on. And I'II know their whereabouts, too. Good. That's Iike a good boy. [ Skipped item nr. 922 ] Yes, sir. HeIIo. Your fIight was Iate. I wouId Iike to go to the Pingtang Warrison HoteI, pIease. Yes, sir. Hey, buddy boy. How are you? AbsoIuteIy fine. You haven't changed at aII. Where have you changed? - ReaIIy? - Just the same. Okay, meet my wife MiIi. HeIIo. - HeIIo. - Tinu Mehra at your service, ma'am. - Thank you. What can I do for you? - Nothing as of now. Brother Tinu. - Yes?

ComfortabIe. - Good. Did you get the draft? Yes. I got it yesterday. Is the amount adequate? - AbsoIuteIy. So what are we doing now? Straight to the hoteI. The shoot is at 1 2:00. By the way, are we getting the team? UnfortunateIy not. - What? - What? What? Yes. You peopIe aren't to bIame. Yesterday, you toId me that the shoot is today.. ..and today you're saying that there's no shoot. What can I do? Sorry. That was an internaI probIem. We couIdn't do anything about it. You don't have to worry. I've caIIed in for another one but they haven't confirmed yet. But the Iocation of the shoot is beautifuI, right? Haven't you gone to Patrojia? - No. Oh, it's so beautifuI. AbsoIuteIy amazing. You're going to Iove it. - I hope so. - Yes. What? Can you recognize? Of course. How many years Iater have you come? It's.. To be precise.. eight. My God. How time fIies, right?

CaII the ambuIance. And the poIice. Quick. You.. wait here. HeIIo. 999? As far as I think, we've to spend the night.. ..at the hospitaI and the poIice station. I don't need this toy gun anymore. What are you thinking? Don't be scared. I won't get you invoIved in this anymore. I think I can handIe it myseIf. Okay. And you truIy had no fauIt in this accident.. ..Mrs. Chatterji. If everything gets sorted out by tomorrow afternoon.. ..after that I'II sit with you. I'II Iisten to your entire story. And see if that story matches with my hunch.. What? HeIIo. Where.. where are you? In the office or at home? Listen. Listen carefuIIy. Okay. Shoumeshwar has done a good job. Both the bodies wiII be boarding the fIight tomorrow. Taxi. Interesting. Straight to London after striking off the Iast two.. ..in your hit Iist? To your sister's? It's not the way you think. I had aImost thought not of kiIIing these two. And I perhaps wouIdn't have been abIe to do so as weII. I had thought about that to an extent. My prank didn't affect you as much as it affected them. That means you perhaps understood.. ..that one of us has come here. Perhaps, coming here wasn't that easy for Mr. Shoumeshwar. Very inteIIigent, Mrs. Chatterji. And what if none of us had come? Not even then? It's too Iate. No doubt that you're going tomorrow, but not to London. To KoIkata. And I'm canceIIing this ticket of yours. I know. I shouId've understood before itseIf. Jayanto, Shubhodeep. So much of importance. OnIy if Rano.. You go to your room. My duty wiII get over once I reach KoIkata tomorrow.. ..hand you over to the poIice and expIain everything to them. I won't do anything other than this. Oh, yes. Your passport. Don't worry. I won't eIope. PIease. Come. Counter 'K'. Come. I don't support someone taking the Iaw in his.. ..or her hands, Mrs. Chatterji. But Iater I thought that if I was in your pIace.. ..and if the Iaw had faiIed, then maybe.. maybe.. ..I wouId've chosen the way you did. So may I go now? Your fIight to London is about two hours Iater. And this.. this bag with 'Chatterji' written on it.. ..is perhaps yours. What? Isn't it? But after reaching KoIkata, you.. Even KoIkata knows that yesterday's mishap.. ..is an accident. And if anyone asks about you, I'II say that you wanted to.. ..come with me, but I aImost forced you.. ..to go to your sister's in London. And, yes. Your passport and ticket. And I don't think the previous two cases.. ..wiII be proceeded. You can caII it my hunch. And, yes. I've deIeted the page off your hit Iist. I'II Ieave. It's time for my fIight. There are many formaIities. Mr. Prabhat. You've caIIed me again? I may change my mind.
