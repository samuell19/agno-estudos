Mama! Ramiro this can't be! Mama! You don't have any right to take her away from us. She's my mother and she's going with me. She wants to. She's my mother, too. She's going with me. She's... Mr. Vicente Cuervo. Leave her alone. Stay out of this. Where've you gone, Mama? Let's go now! Let's go! Let's go! Ramon, for God's sake, Ramon; I've only got one mother... The Survivors Ramon's departure leaves a void in our family. Vicente Cuervo is with us tonight because I have decided to reward his loyalty, his integrity. From now on, in addition to administering the liquor plant, he will be the attorney for the Orozco estate... A toast to our family's staying together. As long as the confusion that surrounds us remains. Let us promise God that we will hold out. In this besieged fortress. Let us drink to it. Mr. Cuervo was appointed the attorney of the estate of the Orozco family. No, I already said that. That's a redundancy. Take it all out. It's already been taken out. All the members of the Orozco family have been very pleased by Mr. Cuervo's appointment. What do you think? Stupendous! Perfect! Good morning. - Good morning. How are you? You are as lovely as ever. You must read what I wrote about you. Ah, I'm very grateful. Where is Don Sebastian? With Father Henriquez in the patio. Fino, go with him. Excuse me. Please forgive us for interrupting you. I leave you in good hands. Thank you. We were talking of the need to organize some recreational and educational activities. Something to keep our spirits up and strengthen our beliefs, something to hold off contamination. And boredom- especially among the young. The Devil uses idle hands. Fill their minds with higher, cleaner thoughts. "Mens Sana in corpore sano," the Classics said. We must be concerned with this. We must have contests and give prizes. Don't you think so, Vicente? And think of everything. We must know what's happening outside. What? I mean, we must watch what course things take. We only hear about expropriations, nationalizations... And nothing's stopped them. They can't go very far. Don't worry. The U.S. has already cut off its sugar purchases. Let's not harbor many hopes. God knows how far it'll go. Do you think this is communism? Well, if it is not. It's very close. They already seized part your land, Don Sebastian. They've promised indemnity. Let's see it first. Let us trust in God. - Amen. Moreover you don't know if you'll see your money from the mortgages. And I must say it, your brother was very astute: When he left he took all that was his and everything that was your mother's. Ramon, the baby of the family. Mama always spoiled him. The best you can do is sell everything you own for whatever it will bring; Farm, apartments, the lot! Sell, you say? Yes, the only real thing is money in your pocket. We must be prepared for any madness they dream up. But, Vicente, the land was given to Gonzalo Orozco over 400 years ago. Who could establish any claim to it? As for the apartments, I didn't take them away from anybody. It'd be illegal... It involves more than legality or illegality. They have the power. That is so. Now, Pascual! You, too? Things aren't that catastrophic. Revolutions are like Saturn: They devour their offspring. That, too, is so. They have unleashed the powers of darkness, as Father Henriquez said a moment ago. This is a temporary chastisement of this people for its corruption and lack of principles. For us, it will be no more than yet another test in our long history. Do not forget; Sometimes the just pay for the sinners. They don't care if you're to blame or not. Bah! That's why you shouldn't run unnecessary risks. There's time to save something - a lot, I would say. With the money... Oh, money, money, money. Look, Vicente, money isn't everything. Well, naturally, but... Gonzalo Orozco discovered America along with Christopher Columbus. And was the first conquistador of this land. His many children, following the glorious example of their father, attacked all the savages who didn't want Spanish culture to flower on this island. Then they brought in the blacks. Oh, man; Don Sebastian and Mr. Vincente are talking about sodomy and gonorrhea and the avenging plague. Huh? - Yes, sir! It's the Avenging Angel. And they talked about a slave farm. Slaves? He's crazy. Lies, lies! Those days are long gone. I heard 'em. Hermenegildo, you've flipped your lid. OK, say its lies. They talked about what they lost in the nationalization of the liquor plant... They're up to something; They aren't stupid. So, I... - You what? I keep my cool... They're big changes on, but I'll keep the money coming in. Money, money. Long as these hands can work, they'll work for free. A dumb nigger like me... These breasts gave the milk for Master Julio, for Manuel, For Miss Fina... Fresh! Julito, Finita, Bartolomé... Where have they gone? You're going to get it! Its bath time. Every day... Leave that; Let's go. Come on! We too, can have a Buick. Scoundrels! Rogues! Thieves! What hurts me the most is their ingratitude. We'll call the police. Let it go, its no use. They'll investigate; The police will come. I'd rather walk than suffer that indignity. Sebastian is right. The laws don't protect decent people any more. Are we at the mercy of the servants, then? Are you letting them do as they please? Will you let them walk off with the cars, the silver and the family mementos, Papa? Don Sebastian, things will return to normal. The point is to survive this period the best we can. But we have to show the servants that here, in the house of the Orozcos, everything is just the same No, not "the same" - better! Much better! Listen to this: Do you remember what happened when the refineries wouldn't refine the Russian oil? Well, they were taken over. And when the Americans withdrew the sugar quota? The Cuban Telephone Company, Texaco, Esso, the Tunicu Sugar Co., the Manati Sugar Co. The Punta Alegre Sugar Co. And the United Fruit Co. Were nationalized. And when the OAS denounced this red "Cuban" government? Then came the Declaration of Havana... Well, then. Vicente Cuervo, propose beating them at their own game. Do they want to show they're more communist every day? Well, we'll live better every day. Do they take the land and factories away from us? We'll do business under their noses. And bring in whiskey, brandy and caviar. No, not caviar!- ham! Big fat steaks - and champagne. Vicente! Careful, don't break it. That stuff's fragile. Pepe, how are you? - Fine! Mission accomplished! Here's the bills and all the stuff. Did you bring everything? - Even fish for the cat! Watch out. But, listen, its getting worse and worse. Now they have those "committees". "Committees"? - Yeah. "for the Defense of the Revolution." Nosey as hell. It's getting so you can't stand it. Any problems? Who, me?! I never have any problems. All you gotta do is get the hand of the system, got it? Capitalism, socialism - same difference to me. Same goes for feudalism. - You're really sharp! Don Sebastian... Pepe! Don Sebastian, this is Pepe Antonio. Oho! Pleased to Meatcha, Senator. I'm not a senator. I'm a Marquess. Marquess? Betcha that's even better. Well, I tell ya, ya know I'll be glad to help out. Pepe can be trusted fully. Yes, yes I see. Do you think this'll last long? We have to be prepared, Pascual. Its better to have plenty than to run short. Leave it there. Well, Marquess, there you are. My name is Sebastian Orozco. Then all that Marquess stuff was just pulling my leg? That's what you were up to, eh Papa? Still an' all anybody can see he has class, a real gent. Vicente, please take care of this gentleman and have everything stored quickly. Excuse me. - Be my guest. Vicente, are any more trucks coming? No, no, no. We have enough. Today the Americans decreed a total embargo. A blockade! Wait til they begin to get hungry outside. Here, we'll have the servants eating out of our hands. Yesterday, the day of the Virgin of Grace. The bountiful lady Fina Orozco, opened a well stocked general store. Now with no need to leave the Orozco family estate, the servants may acquire at modest prices and with all kinds of facilities the exquisite delicacies and fine liqueurs displayed enticingly on its shelves... Today we celebrate a small victory. Outside there are prophesies of calamities, But here inside, we will lack for nothing. Our good friend Vicente has shown intelligence and foresight. A toast to Vicente, and to all who keeps our family united. The we'll have to toast the Revolution that has us locked in here. No? Me alone then. Delicious! Anyone can tell you like the best. Yes, but who doesn't like this aroma and champagne and little "extras"? Not everybody can have "extras." What about you? Well, if you say so... Oh, but what did you think? I just wanted to tell you, with all respect, that you are very beautiful tonight. Ah, flatterer! No, I mean it; I'm serious. Oh, how kind you are! Thank you. It may be the satisfaction of this evening or the eyes with which you look at me... You've eaten, drunk and smoked. Are you satisfied? Well, not completely... Fina - Yes. I wanted to tell you I like you very much... Oh, feel how my heart is throbbing! Ahhh. Oh, Vicente! Poor little chess knight. Papa, the king. Mama, the queen. Uncle Pascual, he's the bishop... Quiet. You'll be seen. Manuel, the castle. Yes, with all his silliness. Manuel will stay in the game to the end. And you? A pawn, a piece to be sacrificed... Chess is a man's game. Women are fruits. They are made for love. Not all of them, though. Not all. There's so little love in the world. What's missing? Look! There is the answer the night gives me. Yes! Yes! Grow and multiply! Love one another! Father, the Cuervos are already moving into the trunk of the Orozco family. You might have waited a little. Now, now, daughter. Don't get upset. Its just that I couldn't resist... What?! Did Vicente force you? I can't believe it. No, it was I who forced him. Its just that I couldn't resist. The itch. The hallowed precinct was beautifully adorned with a floral decoration. The bride's figure was swathed in a new creation of ivory lace. Her jewelry: Costly earrings and a necklace of diamonds, the gift of her father, the Marquess of Pena Seca. Following the ceremony, the happy couple was seen off with tears of joy and a shower of rice. The brief honeymoon was spent on the palatial grounds, after which the couple was welcomed home with joy by the family and servants. Mrs Fina Orozco de Cuervo was radiant in an old rose wedding-traveling outfit. And, now that the U.S. has broken off relations, we are at the mercy of the Comintern. I never thought they'd do such a thing. It's in character. All they care about is money. And now they can't make any profits here...! Don't worry, Don Sebastian. The revolutionaries' days are numbered. When the U.S. breaks relations! They'll send troops and zap! Back to the old ways! But, even so, we're going to take precautions. Any problems, Vicente? Complete success! To fool them, I left 200 pesos in the account. Let's go inside. Here is all your money, safe from any freezing of accounts. We thank You, Lord, for our daily bread. When're you going to learn to sip soup quietly? What if its hot? - Wait til it cools off. And don't blow on it! No, Finita, with the spoon. When the soup has meat or vegetables in it, use your spoon. I don't like it! Try it. I don't want any! Don't be so hard on her. She's very young. Good manners must be learned from the cradle. But if she doesn't like it... - She has to learn! Good manners and discipline are out best defense against the excesses and surround us. But the soup has a strange taste. It's American soup. American soup? Who brought it? I didn't want to tell you. Ramon sent it. Lola, how could you? For a mess of pottage, or whatever, you accepted... In short, I think that this... American... soup will give me indigestion. Bring me my glasses, Fermin. So you've blocked my attack, eh? I've been studying up on defenses lately. After all, resistance has its charms. Do you think we can hold out? You are the king. I'm just a knight who laughs with sad eyes. An unimportant piece. One that almost never survives. Now, now don't be pessimistic. We Orozcos never lost out since we set food in these lands. Of course we will hold out. Mama! - Lola! Mama! What happened to her? - Mama! Lola, what's the matter? A letter from Ramon. What does it say? - It says: "The last wish of our beloved mother" was to be buried in Cuba. We decided the best way to carry out her wish in spite of Castro would be to send "her ashes in packets of soup..." Grandma! Be calm, son; Be calm. It's not too late... Our society was dealt a great loss with the death of Dona Cristina Alvarez Fuste widow of Avelino Orozco general in the War of Independence. On departing this world, she leaves many pleasing memories of her kind nature and great heart. Following a long and torturous path, her ashes have returned to the land that witnessed her birth and will serve to enrich it so the noble, high principles of her family will continue to flower- this family now weeping for this exemplary wife, beloved mother and self-sacrificing grandmother. Thanks be to God! They're here! They're here at last! They're here! Here at last! Communique number 1: Air and sea landing forces are attacking several points in the southern part of Las Villas Province. They came to grab the land the Revolution gave us. A toast! Let us raise our glasses to the beginning of the end! Forces of the Rebel Army and the National Militias seized the last positions that the mercenary forces has occupied in national territory. Playa Giron, the last point the mercenaries held, fell at 5.30 p.m. The Revolution has won, though at a high cost in invaluable lives of fighters who opposed the invaders and attacked them incessantly, without any letup, destroying in just 72 hours the army the imperialist U.S. Government had been organizing for many months... Forward forward. Forward, heroic guerrillas! March forward guerrillas... But we will hold out here. We have to prepare for the worst. Excuse me, Don Sebastian. Pardon my interrupting. What is it? I would like to ask your permission to... To...? Tell me what is it. I'd like your permission to baptize my son with your name. Sebastian? Sebastiancito, eh? But what if its a girl? - No! Oh, if you only knew... No! It will be a boy. He will look like you- another Sebastian Orozco. What about your last name? That'll be only an initial: Sebastian C. Orozco. It doesn't sound very good... No, it really doesn't. I'm sorry, but... Let's wait a little. Maybe it'll be a girl. What time is it? - 11:55 For God's sake pray. Pray with all you've got. Our Father Who art in heaven... Drink this. It'll make you push even your guts out. No, no! Give me that. My God! Let me be; I know what I'm doing. There's only minutes left. Can't you do something? This is a normal birth. Don't you realize soon it'll be too late? Nature's like that. He'll come when he's ready. Oh, Doctor, please! Doctor, the forceps! Madam, my Hippocratic oath! It's born! Its the Revolution! Let me see! Oh! Let me stay with my girl! You've got to do something! Call on the spirits. Only 1 minute left. Light and progress, brother; Forward, brother; Forward light and progress, light and progress... Feet first! Thanks be to God! Pull it! No, Orozco could be on July 26th! It's a boy! A boy! She did it! A boy. A boy! A boy? No matter, its the Orozcos who write the history of the Orozcos... At 11:59 pm. On July 25, 1961. Sebastian C. Orozco by the grace of God emerged to the light of life after a sweet serene birth. A boy, Don Sebastian! I knew it! Yes, yes! Do you renounce the Devil? - I renounce him. And all his works? - I renounce them. And all his forms? I renounce him. Vicente. What is it? - Come here. What is it? The government people have changed all the money. What's that? Well, its the same money but with different patriots. Ours- - isn't worth a red cent. They're changing the money. They've robbed us. They'll take everything. They'll come in this house. They'll treat me like Marie Antoinette... Just a minute, Father! - Yes? We must pause. We mustn't interrupt saving this child's soul. Father, go on with the rite until the Communists arrive. They aren't coming. What they're doing is issuing new money. If we don't change our money, we'll be ruined. Go on with the ceremony. But... - Please reflect: If we hurry, each of us can change 10,000 pesos. Of course. I'll help you. Just a minute! Where are you going? How can you behave like this? Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? For a handful of money, you're ready to profane this rite. Father Henriquez, Father! Where is the Father? Father, Father, Father... Father! Father, you aren't leaving? I must pack Anyway, he's in the hands of God. Do you think he will suffer many years in purgatory? Nonsense! Nonstop to heaven! He's had his purgatory here! Father and...? - You, too, nonstop! We've all earned it Each year of the Revolution cancels out 1000 in purgatory! Don't bother. I know the way. Goodbye. Who will come to say Mass and read us the Gospel? To whom will you entrust us? Father Boza? He's leaving too. - No! Really, just now I can't think of anybody. Just between us, those who're staying... They keep saying that Christ was a revolutionary. But you can't abandon us like this... Why don't you live with us? No, no. Let me think... But, of course! You are the one called to be my successor. There is the Bishop Orozco. And Fray Teofilo, a martyr. Their blood runs in your veins. Father... Do you think it could be possible? You know... I am... chaste. Yes, of course. Moreover you are a saint. Take heart! But won't I have to fill in an application blank? Don't worry about it. In case of extremity... Here, you are in a special situation. Don Pascual, consecrate yourself! No one is more deserving of the cassock. Pull yourself together! - Father! It has been our lot to live in a fateful time. It seems the Most High only extends His hand to harm us. But, woe to him who thinks this! I have donned this habit not out of pride... The Lord knows this well. I have done so to remind you that only the fear of God can keep us together inside these walls, that only discipline will enable us to hold out until the chaos all around us is ended... These are times of cloisters, of sacrifice and of austerity; Of fasting and of abstinence... This is a new flood! And the floodgates of heaven were opened and it rained for 40 days and 40 nights. And God remembered Noah and every living thing that was with him in the ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters as waged. Oh Lord, I can't see even a little bit of land. I shall send forth a raven to search. And Noah sent forth the raven, which went forth and did not return. The days passed and the just and pious Noah sent forth a dove... The dove returned with an olive leaf in her mouth to show Noah that they were near land. I set my bow in the cloud as a covenant with the survivors of the Flood... It will remind me not to send another flood. No, no, no. God meant it was a flood of water. You must change that ending, Manuel. You must make it much more forceful. I don't believe God promised anything. Aren't we in the presence of a new Flood? What's holding her up? The baby's crying. I can't! Hold your breath! What about Julio? Isn't he coming? God willing, he'll repent in time. Oh, my Julio! I'll try to convince him. Help her get down. Hurry, Dona Lola! The baby's crying. Julio! Listen to the latest news: The Americans've issued an ultimatum. Castro shot down a U.S. plane. Come to the shelter... Take it easy! We can always find a new reason for a toast. Here. - No, thanks. Come on, come on! To universal happiness! This way, we include yours, mine and that of all the poor fools who harbor dreams. No need to be selfish. Why stay here? What do I lose by it? Look, I'm not an alarmist, but the fuse is lit. We are on the brink of nuclear war! You know what? Everything might be better if millions were killed. Man would go back to a cave and would have a chance to choose his destiny. I bet he wouldn't sign any social contract. Do what you want! What a joke it would be if nothing happened! "Every man is born, dreams his dream and then Di..." Here, the great chain of freedom, broadcasting from Cuba, free territory in America... This is too much! How can we know what's happening? The radio always says the same thing. We haven't even heard any cannon shots. Maybe its like I read: We're dead and don't know it. Don't blaspheme! Why can't the Avenging Angel use poison gas? I'm going on a reconnaissance mission. No. No. Let's do things properly. Nicanor! - Yes? Go and get some soft drinks and ice. It's very hot. Right away! Noah first sent forth a bird with black feathers. How long are we going to wait? Manuel, you will be the dove. Go forth and fly! Do me the favour of getting out of here immediately. Want a slice of ham? Its very good ham! You must behave properly. We have guests. Forward, gentlemen. Come on, you can leave the shelter now. The Apocalypse has been put off yet again. Heretic, how dare you question the words of our Lord? The day is upon us when we'll go forth to the light. But you will sink farther into the mud and ignominy. That is what your pride will get you! All who wanted to be saved, return to the shelter... Come on, everybody, to the shelter; Follow me. You will enter the kingdom of heaven, my daughter! Come on; Come on over here. All who want to stuff themselves, follow me. This was all we could save from their insanity. Save, eh? Listen now to what I say: The sardine ate the shark today. Listen now to what I say: The sardine ate the shark today. Love me, my darling, oh, my sweet love; Whom I will love always, I, with your kisses. And your caresses. All of my suffering... They just told me. They don't feel like working. Look at this mess! You don't understand, Vicente Cuervo. You only understand numbers and accounts. You don't understand the need for pleasure that has accumulated for thousands of years. Every one of the Ten Commandments is a fetter placed on man. Every law of society is a chain. I think I've heard that before. You sound just like the people outside, Julio. I'm sorry for you; You're a domesticated animal. You see no difference between water and wine. You are much closer than I am to the one you call " the people outside." Wine has flowed down the stairs. Meat rots in the gardens and in the servants bellies. Why don't you go tell them to get to work? Its your place to do it. They've had centuries of oppression. You have to give them time. Maybe tomorrow... Tomorrow it'll be worse, because they'll be used to it. In a week they'll throw us out. Reflect Julio! There are hardly any provisions, and this is war: The ones outside against us, we who are here inside. If we can hold out and maintain order here, we will win. The you and I, the only ones who do any thinking in this house, will be the ones who... How can you forget you are an Orozco? How petty! How insignificant the world is! A cocktail of ambition, selfishness and calculation! My spirit is too big for such a narrow era! And I? What can I do? Well, paradise is over. If you want to eat you'll have to work, understand? Poor devils! You'll never know that we almost achieved it. For a moment, we were happy, as far as we could see. Yes I know; I am an Orozco. So much the better! All the pleasure will be mine! And you, Vicente Orozco will write a speech. You know how to do these things. A speech that will make them work for us out of hope and fear. They could work our fields and get a part of the crop. We need a good protector of the faith. I'll delegate some power to my Uncle Pascual so he can scare them a little. We'll have to buy oxen, plows, equipment. Remind them that there's rationing outside and that, out there, everyone works on Sunday. Promise them that, when the Revolution collapses - but don't set any time limit- and everything returns to normal, we'll give them posts in Customs, the casinos and even the police force. I want that speech right now! The Orozco family is pleased to offer a toast to the enchanting 'jeune fille', Finita V. Orozco on her 15th birthday. A torrent of joy... Very good! Very good! Drink up! Happy birthday, Finita. And now, to dance! Dance! Music! Look how he squeezes her. Keep an eye on him. Don't exaggerate, Fina. Remember, Bartolomé is Julio's heir. He's a cur! All I want is her happiness. But, since she's not your daughter...! Why are you like this? Come on, let's dance. When I was her age, I was at the Sacred Heart in Boston. What a time that was! Oh, Vicente, I'm afraid. Last night, I had a terrible dream. I dreamed I cleaned the house. It was full of dust and spider webs, and Julio laughed. He abased me, as if I were Cuca. Relax, my dear. It was only a nightmare. Yes, but he has always hated me. When I was a little girl, he made me eat a lizard. And he liked to feel me. So, when I saw Bartolomé with Finita... They're calling us. Let's go in. How do I look? - Enchanting. Tonight, in addition to my niece's birthday, we are celebrating an important family event. It gives me great pleasure to announce the betrothal of my son Bartolomé and my niece Finita. Don't kill him! What's going on? Tie him up. Tie him up! Didn't that black bitch say anything else? Only that they can't stand it any more and are leaving. Take this and go find Valentin. Try not to attract any attention. Piles of Orozcos poring over these papers as if there weren't anything else to do... Five centuries of Orozcos. There won't be a sixth one! Julio! What are you doing, Julio? My God, the archives! I must pull them out by the roots! Like weeds! Out! Out! All of it out! No servants and no masters! The fall of the house of Orozco! Hail Mary, full of grace; The Lord is with you, and you are blessed- He is my son. It's horrible. Couldn't we...? Mama, Mama. In 5 minutes, he has destroyed all our history. Centuries and centuries. It'll take years to restore. Its just lucky I have it all here. He's crazy! I've always said he was crazy. He could kill somebody any day. He has no respect! He's... a... A drunk. But he's my son. This is a crisis. And as if this weren't enough, a great danger threatens. The servants are planning to run away at midnight. I ask for a free hand! Good. Hurry. We'll have to catch them off guard. Hey, you know it wasn't easy bringing this stuff in. An' I gotta remind you: You still owe me. All right; Everything will be worked out. We ain't had problems yet, but I gotta have that money now. If the people outside ever found out about this...! They aren't going to find out, Pepe Antonio. Grab him! - Hey, what's this?! Just a minute, buddy. Listen this is Pepe, pal... Hey! This is a helluva way... Buddy, Vicen... What's going on, pal? Don Vicente. Let's go! Where're you taking me? Hey! Wait! Hey, gimme a chance! Shit! No. Hey, Vicente... Today, we are initiating an era of order and progress. Those whose destiny in the world is to serve, work and produce enough wealth. For their own sustenance and our own let themselves be seduced by foreign ideas and prepared to desert, to abandon their sacred obligations to this house. Ingrates! Therefore and to break the chaos that threatens us, we have been forced to take the reins of power. The rebellion has been crushed. The sacred destiny of the Orozco family, illuminated by the brilliant torch of Don Sebastian, of whose spiritual legacy we are depositories has been saved. We will guide this ship surely through the stormy sea that surrounds us and bring it to a safe port with a safe hand. Long live the Orozco family! Long may it live! Get moving! Go on! Hurry up! On the ground? Get moving! Look: Aurora's fainted! Get her up! We've got to move her! Who gave you permission to knock off? Get back to work! Big shot eh? Throwing your weight around. Move it! Let's go. Come on, move. You, too. Go to the house! Get back to work! I'm a young girl. Very pretty. Sadness is unknown to me. I'm a young girl, very pretty. Sadness was unknown to me. But last night - oh's the pity- I don't know what came over me: While dancing to a ditty my heart beat loud and free. Can't hold out any more. All done for. OK, but we're leaving them without any tools. And they're leaving us without any ribs. That's their problem! If they kill us, they won't eat. Who would have thought it? If Don Sebastian were alive, none of this would happen. It's all your fault cause you're lazy. But I... Well... Everything's upside down and going sideways, like a crab. And slavery's back! I don't even know my name, but it isn't the same being a slave as being free. Here! Take this and run away. A file! I'm a young girl, very pretty. Sadness was unknown to me. But last night - oh's the pity- I don't know what came over me: While dancing to a ditty my heart beat loud and free. Ah, I think that it is filthy. Because love has come to me. It must be; Oh, it must be. Have no doubts; Love's come to me. Hey, I don't know how to work it. This? All you do is squeeze it here. Surrender! Throw down your arms! You're surrounded! The lives of those who give themselves up will be spared. Run for it! We'll cover you! Revolution! The storming of the Bastille. Liberty, equality, fraterni- Hey, "buddy"! Every man is born, dreams his dream and then dies. Rest in peace. Julio and Bartolom‏e, bring the dogs. Charge! We give You thanks, Almighty God, for granting us this food so we may continue serving You on this earth. What food, Uncle? - Don't be disrespectful To what? To Uncle Pascual, to you, to the table, to God? Shut up. You certainly do take after your father. Luckily, Bartolom‏e is different. But the table's bare. Somebody has to bring- -The quarry. Let us behave as if the food were here. We must trust in Divine Providence. Faith can move mountains. But we must act. What was that, heretic? All action is wrong, because to wish to be active is to offend God. Who is the only One Who should act. But we don't have to take it literally, do we? But, Uncle, what should we do then? Very simple: We'll work. Julito's right. I supposed you mean you young people, right? Let him work if he wants to. What did he say? - Work "Behold the fowls of the air:" For they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; "Yet your heavenly Father feedeth them." St. Matthew, Chapter 6, Verse 26. But "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread." Genesis, Chapter 3, Verse 19 And He said that first. Yes, but He was inexperienced them. How are we going to survive, Uncle? My God. What have we come to! There's no authority. What we need is a man with some guts, like Vicente. We've always had them. - We have? I know how to carry out my historic responsibility. I'm hungry. What's that? - He's hungry. Yes, hungry. You are, too. We have to do something. If we have to work, well, we'll work! Who's going to work? Everybody! - Me?! I'd rather die! Those of us who are older can dedicate ourselves to administrative work, intellectual work, to organizing. There's nothing to organize here. But what about planning? And bookkeeping? Nothing like that needs doing. There's nothing to buy or sell. Working means producing. He who doesn't work won't eat. That's Communism! I knew that those ideas would creep into this house. Oh, Vicente! How we need you! Here it is! Will you work? Excuse me. I'm too old to learn how to work. I can hardly move. What can I do? Grandma, I've read that, when the Eskimos get old and can't work, they just walk away and disappear. And they die? Well...? Don't worry, Mama. You can frighten away the birds that eat the crops. What should I do? We'll see. But I can hardly walk. I'm very old. The youngsters will do the hunting and plowing. You old people Will do the cleaning. But look, Manolito, I can't move a finger. No, don't tie it too tight. Hold him. Let him go. Let him go. Uncle! And now who's going to marry Finita and me? You will! Yes... yes. And Dona Lola? Mama! No meat, eh? The cartridges ran out. I'll hunt with bullets, but there aren't many left. This was all we could find. There's less every day. - Yes. This reminds me of when the Admiral was shipwrecked. Uncle, when is the wedding going to be? What wedding? - Mine and Finita's. I'd forgotten! How about May? May's a perfect month for weddings. Oh yes! May, how pretty, the month of flowers. What month is this? I don't want to be married. Not to Bartolomé or anyone else. If not to me, to whom could it be? Nothing? Why do you write so much, Uncle? Do you know how it's all going to end? I'm already getting to the end. I don't want anybody else to write it for me. For one thing, its a matter of style. Intercede with the Most High to lift this punishment. Oh, Sebastian Orozco! You who were so good on earth, you who are always with us. Give us a sign! It cooked her.
