[skateboard scraping] WOMAN: Babe, are you okay? MAN: Yeah. Why? The highway's in the other direction. I know. I know. Just taking a short detour, Hollis. A short detour to where, Paul? You'll see, Jacob. Just, uh, sit tight, and no more questions, please. [engine turns off, music stops] PAUL: There he is. Does that gentleman look familiar to you, Jacob? I don't know. A little. A little? [laughs] The three of us were, like, best friends in high school. Come on. Ben Hall? Who the hell's Ben Hall? It's Cole. Cole Weaver. And what, he's coming with us? Okay, I thought you'd be a little bit more excited than that. I mean, aren't you curious as to what he's been up to, why he completely vanished without a trace after high school, just didn't keep in touch with anybody? How did you find him out of the blue? I didn't. He found me on Facebook a few weeks ago. Next thing I know, we're talking on the phone, and the thought occurred to me, hey, why not invite him for the weekend, have ourselves a little reunion, you know? [sighs] What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. It's just... when you haven't seen or heard from someone in a long time, what if you've run out of things to talk about? What if things are awkward? Hon, relax. Everything's gonna be great. I know it. I'm with Sam. Yeah. Ah, fuck it. Why not? All right. [classical music playing softly] Ah, still a bookworm, I see. [chuckles] Can't help it. Love good stories, man. How the hell have you been? Good, good. Look at you. The Facebook photos don't do you justice. Years have treated you well. Yeah, you think? Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. You two, uh, don't look too shabby yourselves. Been good, Jacob? Yeah. Yeah, can't complain. Good. Nice. [chuckles] Well, let's hit it. Don't want to keep the ladies waiting. The ladies? Yeah. Wow. Don't I feel like the odd one out. Huh. You'll be all right. It's good to see you, man. Hmm. This Cole guy is awfully cute. Heh. Is he now? Oh, come on. You don't think so? You know you do. Say hi to Cole, guys. Hi, Cole. I'm Hollis. You have a girlfriend. She's pretty. Yes, she is. I'm Samantha, or Sam. Nice to meet you, Sam. You're dating a movie star, too. Jesus, you guys got all the breaks. Okay. We got a bit of a drive ahead of us. We can save the flattery for later. COLE: Ah, yeah. Oh, you said your folks' place was nice, but this? Wow. It's something else, man. Perks of having wealthy parents, huh? Even fussy ones? Paul had to plead with them to let us stay the weekend. For real? I always remembered your folks as being laid-back. Yeah, that was before they did well in the stock market and bought this place. Now it's all about protecting your assets. All right? Yep. Look at this. Right, all right? SAM: Cute. Welcome. Welcome, welcome to casa de Stark. Feel free to make yourselves at home. Just make sure you obey the one house rule. Don't have too much fun. Okay? Now who wants a tour? Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Come on, then. [door opens] [cell phone rings] [ring] [ring] Hello. You're with them, aren't you? Yeah. Got to Paul's folks' place a little while ago. Pretty nice spot. What happened to the idea of all of us talking again before you took off? You're upset. That's because I hadn't made up my mind yet, Nathan. You knew that. That's why we were all going to talk. [sighs] Right now, I'm thinking this is a really dumb idea. It was your idea, Emily. The three of us talked for hours, and now you're getting cold feet? Em, if you lose your nerve, you're gonna regret it the rest of your life. Now, don't back out now. [knock on door] Uh, hey, I gotta go. Reunion time. No, wait. Please don't do this. Just make an excuse, and leave. [hangs up] [sighs] Mind being the rock? Paul and Jacob give it a shot? They went to town to get some wine. [grunts] It's really on there. [chuckles] [seal pops] Thank you. My hero. You're getting dinner started? Well, it seems like spaghetti is all anyone knows how to make around here, which is a shame, considering all the food we found in the fridge and the freezer. I hope it doesn't go to waste. It won't. I promise. [music playing only] [men laughing] Can I just say that dinner was freaking amazing? Hey, cheers to that, buddy. Hear. Yep. Seriously. Here I thought we'd be stuck with just spaghetti. How'd you prepare that chicken anyways? Yeah, did you work as a chef, or that just another one of your God-given talents? No. Just learning to cook, actually. One of the few upsides of a stint in the psych ward. [chuckles] Psych ward? Serious? Yeah. No need to hide it. I had a serious nervous breakdown, medical emergency. You know, the outside world thinks that when you're living in a state facility, that the food is slop. There was this restaurant chef who lived on the same hall as me. We worked in the kitchen together, and he really just took me under his wing. [chuckles] [laughing] You should all see your faces right now. Priceless. Great. Yeah. Glad to see you didn't lose your sense of humor, Cole. Hey, what's a reunion without a few jokes? So how 'bout the truth? How did you learn to cook? My mom taught me everything I know. Here's to moms. To moms. To moms. How's your mom doing? She passed on. I'm sorry. It's all right. It was a while back. She had a long battle with cancer. Um... when it was all over, you know, I felt this kind of peace for her, all that pain she had been through. Still, had to be pretty rough, though. I lost my mom, too, so I get it. How'd your dad take it? [chuckles] Dad. [laughs] Oh, Dad flew the coop before I could ride a bike. My brother, on the other hand... he went down a real dark place after Mom passed. Your twin brother? I totally forgot. Nathan. Uh, he went to a different school. Yeah. My mother's idea. You know, she thought it would be better for the both of us. Develop our own friendships, our own personalities. But the truth is, though, you know, Nathan and I, we stayed real close. You could say we're inseparable. HOLLIS: Identical twins? Like, completely? Nathan and me, it's practically down to the last freckle. And how's he doing? Well, like I said, you know, after Mom died, it's as if a switch just flipped. He'd get mad at the smallest of things. I'd never seen him lose his temper before. Hell, I didn't even know he had one. Suddenly... he's just lost, you know, floating around out there, angry as hell. I'll never forget this one day, though. Nathan was walking his dog up by his apartment. His dog peed on some guy's grass. The guy comes out, starts yelling at Nathan, and kicks his dog. Nathan flipped. He pulls out his knife, and I run up, and I try to stop him, so I grab him, and he nicks me in the face, you know, hence the scar. But then he starts wailing on this guy, like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, just wailing on this guy. [laughs] Oh, my God. What's so funny, Jacob? Oh, come on. This is just another one of Cole's twisted jokes, right? [laughs] Good one, man. Guy was in the ICU for a month. Lucky for him and my brother he didn't die. My brother spent a year and a half in prison, aggravated assault. But, yeah, you're right. That's something I'd joke about. Pardon me. PAUL: Hey... Cole. [sighs] Why did you do that? Well, honest to God, I thought he was just messing with us again. You need to apologize to him, Jacob. Like, now would be good. Yeah. Yep, I'm going. Mm, Jesus Christ. [heavy breathing] [sighs] Fucking damn it. [knock on door] Just a sec. [knock on door] Yeah, yeah. Hey. Hey, you got a sec, Cole? Sure. What's up? God, I, uh, shouldn't have assumed you were joking about your brother. I was out of line. I'm sorry about that. So you guys really close? You know, like you hear all the time about identical twins. Yeah, we are. Anyway, though, uh... apology accepted. Well, uh, how's Nathan doing now? I mean, has he gotten better? Sounds like your brother's been through a lot. What? Mm, nothing. It's just, uh... glad to hear you actually care. Or is this just an act, Jacob? An act? No. No, man, of course I care. He's made some improvements. Good. Yeah. That's--That's good. Yeah. Doc's got him on lithium. Seems to be helping. Yeah. We all fuck up, Cole, make bad mistakes. It's inevitable. Hell, I know I've-- I've messed up some things. Really? Like... Um, my point is I know what it's like to feel shame, just like Nathan probably felt after he beat the crap out of that guy. Luckily he's got you to help him through the rough patches, huh? I try, you know. I'm as close to my brother as anyone. But honestly, after Mom died, Nathan just turned into a loner. After his 18 months in prison, he didn't want to trust anyone anymore, even me. You want my opinion? About? How to regain your brother's trust. Look, medication is great... but I'm guessing Nathan blames himself for something. You know, maybe your mom's death. I don't know. Just a guess. Or for his constant anger, his acts of violence, whatever it is. He hates himself for something. That's what I think. You need to tell him that it's all okay. Do you really think I can do that, just get through to him like that? Are you kidding me? Mr. cool in a crisis? Mr. fast on his feet? Come on. There wasn't a thing we all thought you couldn't do back in high school. We? Everybody. That was your rep. Cool Cole. I fucking envied you, man. Yeah, I'm starting to remember your rep now. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You could be a real bully and asshole, Jacob. [sighs] [laughs] Okay. Okay, so now you decide to fuck with me. Hey, guilty as charged. You left yourself wide open for that one, pal. [laughs] [sighs] And, yeah, you, um, better come downstairs and join us, or I'm gonna look like the asshole of the century. I'll be down in a minute. PAUL: Thought you said Cole was on his way down. That's what he said. Uh, holy shit. Look at you. Ah, you look pretty much the same, except you got rid of that awful man bun. Thank God. [laughs] [slow instrumental playing] Baby, what were you thinking? I don't know. What is anybody ever thinking in high school, right? Yeah, well, ancient history. All I see now is a handsome, caring man in front of me. [kiss] You, uh, ever get Cole to sign this? Yeah. Should be on the last page. &quot;See you when I see you, man?&quot; Sounds kind of distant, hmm? Cole wrote that? I don't remember. Maybe he was just having a bad day. Yeah, maybe. I mean, he did always have terrible penmanship, too. Dance with me, baby. Nah. I'll watch you. Come on, baby, please. I'll watch you. Fine. Will you dance with me, then? I will. Okay. Ah. [laughs] [laughs] Fancy. Cole, let me ask you something. How is it that a guy like you, who can cook and dance and isn't too hard on the eyes-- Hey, now. Why is it that you're single? Who says I'm single? Facebook. [chuckles] Don't tell me you're putting us on again. Facebook, the digital bible. If it's so written that I'm single, then it must be true. All right, so which is it? So you're not single? You know, I should tell you that, uh, there was a rumor going around few years ago, uh, through the high-school grapevine that you were married and there was-- something happened, and you separated. That's true. Bullshit rumors. Why do you care so much, Paul? Haven't seen you for, like, 10 years, man. What's the point of a reunion if we can't be honest with each other, right? And take Jacob over here just stewing on the chair. I see him every week on the golf course. I know him better than the back nine. Why don't you just leave Cole alone and let him dance, Paul? Yeah, seriously. Cole, what happened to that one girl? You couldn't stop talking about her. Uh, she went to that private girls school. What was her name? Emily. No idea. Just drifted apart. No idea? Like, the way you talked about her, man, you were in love, absolutely crazy about her. Now you're telling me that you just lost track of her? How is that possible? Jesus Christ, Paul! What the hell is wrong with you, man?! The guy just pours out his heart about his mother and brother, and now you're pressing him about his love life?! I mean, fucking A, just leave him alone. Whoa. I got it. Like that wasn't bat-shit crazy. I-- He's your best friend. Yeah. He's probably just had one too many. Just let him sleep it off. Jacob. Jacob, will you wait a second, please? [sighs] Go on. What is it, Sam? Well, how 'bout you tell me what's going on? [exhales] [scoffs] I've never seen you go off like that. Okay? It was fucking scary. [sighs] Hey, you okay? Babe, do you hear me? I'm sorry. It's okay. [young girl whimpering] No. No. Whoa. What is it? [gagging] You okay? [flushes toilet] [spits] Tell me what's in your head right now. Please. [groans] I had a feeling this would catch up with me in shape or form sooner or later. That what would catch up? Whatever you want to call it, guilt... shame. [sighs] A mistake that can't be undone, a motherfucker of motherfuckers. Okay, what guilt? I don't understand. [moaning] Okay. Em? You are up early, hon. Anxious? Well, Nathan is not answering his phone, so who knows what could be happening? Check the local news? Well? No reports of any homicide... yet. You should be trying to call him, too, Cole. He's your brother, and he'll listen to you. Babe, look, we've got to call this off. Think about Nathan. He already has a police record. This could put him away for 30 years. My brother is fine doing what we all agreed to. You wanted Jacob gone, Em. That's what we all want. I'm not going to call Nathan, and he's not going to get caught. When Nathan gets something in his head, he is like a runaway train. The three of us were supposed to talk again before going ahead with the plan. Hey, he cares about you, about me, and now you're having second thoughts? This asshole is living his life without a care in the world, whereas you have been suffering endlessly. A week does not go by where you are not wakened by one of your nightmares. Then there are your panic attacks in the middle of the day. I do not care how many times a month you see a therapist. She's not helping you. Let's think about Jacob. You really think he's doing that great? I mean, you haven't seen him since high school. Who knows? He could be suffering just as much as I am. Yeah, you're right. He could be. However, I have a strange feeling it is nothing like what you go through. I also have a strange feeling that you talked to Nathan last night. You told him the same thing you are telling me, didn't you? That's why he's not answering his phone. We all know how persuasive you can be, Em, but you are not thinking clearly. No, I am not the one who is confused here, Cole. I am done talking about this. No, wait. Babe, please. I'm sorry. You don't know where the reunion is. No, not a clue. Honest to God, babe. Nathan set the whole thing up. He started talking to Paul when the phony Facebook page was created. I-I stayed out of it. Even if I did know, what would you do? Just show up and let them all know what we've been plotting? Get Nathan in even more trouble? He is a convicted felon, and he is carrying a gun. You wanted retribution, Em. Remember? You wanted an ending. You wanted peace. I don't-- I don't feel peaceful. This is bigger than you, Em. College track-and-field star sentenced to four months of solitary confinement in a minimum-security jail. This rich, entitled prick destroyed a young girl's life, and all he got was a slap on the wrist for it. I know. And that girl, her name is Ashley. Do you remember what you said to me the day this news was announced? Full of anger and rage, you said, &quot;It is time someone does something,&quot; and that someone is me. The one to get payback for all the Ashleys out there, the kind of payback they deserve. Yeah, God, I know what I said, Cole, but this, this isn't it. I do. I want payback. I want it for me, I want it for them, but murder is not it. I promise you, if Ashley were here right now, she would tell you the same thing. Would she? [sighs] Didn't sleep much? Look like a pile of turds glued together. Wow. That's, uh-- That's a nice thing to say. Then again, it's probably true. So what's up? What's going on between you and Cole, man? 'Cause ever since we picked him up, you've been acting weird. And last night, I've never seen you lose control like that. I want to blame the beer, but I don't think that's it. I owe you, um, an apology. Accepted. [shuddering] Feel like talking? Jacob. Hi. Hi. Is Cole around? He told me to meet him here. And you are? Emily. No shit? Well, isn't this an honor? I finally get to put my eyes on the girl my good pal has been talking about. He can't shut up about you. [chuckles] I'm Jacob. Jacob West, host of the party? Uh, Cole hasn't shown up yet, but you're welcome to come in and wait for him. Okay. Can I get you a drink? Name it. My parents have quite the inventory of libations. Libations? What's that word mean? It's code for liquor. [chuckles] PAUL: Jacob. Jacob. Where'd you just drift off to? High school, graduating class of 2006, emperors of the universe. Right. Wasn't that what we called ourselves? Yeah, among other things. Ohh. Oh, when you look back at it, it's-- it's a different picture. Or it is for me. You know, those four stupid years, you're--you're practically unconscious the whole time. You're in a dream. You haven't a fucking clue about the real world. Yeah, still a nice dream. Yeah, except when it's not. [cell phone buzzing] Hello. Paul? Yeah. Hey, Paul, i-it's Nathan, Cole's brother. Oh. Hey. Found your number on Facebook. Hope you don't mind my calling out of the blue. How's the reunion? My brother behaving himself? Uh, yeah, well, he hasn't changed much since high school. You know, Cool Cole, nothing upsets him. and he still likes to make people laugh, you know? [chuckles] Yeah, I know. So what do people do at a reunion, Paul? Never been to one. Seriously? Seriously. Well, Cole cooks great meals. We drink, swap memories, dance to old tunes. So what can I do for you, Nathan? I-I've been trying to reach Cole. Uh, seems he's got his phone off. Okay. Well, you want me to take a message? I'm sure he's still asleep. I was hoping you could, uh-- was hoping you could get him to call me. Sooner the better. It's important. Hell, wake the lazy bum up if you have to. Okay, normally I wouldn't do that, but I know how close you two guys are. Hey, thanks, Paul. Take care. Yeah, you, too, man. [hangs up] [sighs] [classical music playing] Hey, Cole, you in there? Babe, you mind? I was sleeping. Sorry. What's up, man? [cell phone buzzing] Hmm. Hey, Nathan. What's going on? Your old buddy Paul said something's urgent. Yeah, um, I'm just moving your car like you asked me. My driveway, off the street, right? That's what's so important? Really? [sighs] So what the hell's up? You tell me. Why isn't that son of a bitch dead already? I have to find the right moment and the right place. It's not like I just snap my fingers. Emily called you, tried to talk you out of it, didn't she? Yeah, don't worry about it. She didn't succeed. You sure? Whose side are you on? What the hell is that supposed to mean? No, we all agreed on the plan, Cole. It's not my fault Emily's backing out now. Just tell me I can trust you. You know what my life's been like since Mom died, right, the hell I've been through. You couldn't last in prison one day, Cole, so this job I'm gonna do for you and Emily, the job you don't have the balls to do yourself, I'm doing it. Damn right, you're gonna trust me. Okay, okay. All right. I hear you. Just call me when it's over. Hey, wait. Wait. Um... there's, uh, something I been meaning to ask you, like, for a very long time. Before I was in prison, you know, when I was in the cuckoo's nest, um, the day I got out, why weren't you there? Oh, Emily was. Because I was working. I explained all of that to you. So that's your excuse for hardly visiting me in both places, 'cause you were always working. You know, I got to thinking in prison, what type of brother do I really have? Then I thought, &quot;No, I'm just being negative. &quot;I got a great brother. We've always been close.&quot; But now, you know what I'm feeling? Once I kill Jacob for you, you won't give a crap about me again. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if you called the cops on me. What the fuck? Are you losing it? You taking your meds? Screw you, Cole. You got the address. You come kill the bastard yourself. Who's Skip, Nathan? Or did you tell me that once? An old prison buddy? Guy to call when you need a gun or help getting out of a jam? Isn't that right? That's none of your business. What, are you digging through my glove box now? Ah, that doesn't sound very trusting. [sighs] Not bad. Could use some competition, buddy. Nah, nah, I'm-- I'm fine just watching. Come on. Where's the fun in that? Horseshoes, huh? Haven't played since I was a kid. - Yeah? - Yeah. You up for a round? Jacob's playing bench. [chuckles] Sure. Let's see if your horseshoe game's as good as your cooking. Guess that's a yes. You're becoming a bore, man. Hah! Look at that. He's human after all. PAUL: You're up. Where are the ladies? PAUL: I think you need more practice first. Oh. Or not. [clicks tongue] [sighs] Man, it's late. You're never late. Sorry about that, Skip. So what's up? Ah, wait. Let me guess. Let me guess. The revolver you got, right, you want a refund? But guess what. I don't fucking do refunds. I know that. I know. I kn-- I know. I-- What-- What the fuck, man? Why are you acting, like, so weird, man? I'm good. Nothing. I'm good. I go--I got 600 bucks cash. Heh. As opposed to a check? What can I get for it? What the fuck? Just calm down. What the hell? I'm gonna pat you down, all right? What the hell, man? You-- Oh, you think I'm wearing a wire?! Really?! You said that when I called you, you'd be able to help me. Who are you? What? Get the fuck out of my car. W-Wha... Get the fuck out of my car! Got this, girl. You can do it. Yep. Girl, that's how it's... HOLLIS: Damn. NATHAN: His doc's got him on lithium. Seems to be helping. Place your bets. HOLLIS: Take that. Oh, shit. Hey. You lost? Were you just in Cole's room? Fine. All right, don't tell me. None of my business, right? Oh, look, he's got everyone fooled. Not me, though, okay, not anymore. I'm onto him. Do you mind translating that, buddy? Cole a righty or a lefty, Paul? Do you remember? [sighs] He's a lefty. What? You're telling me that's Nathan downstairs and not Cole? I'm telling you to go check Cole's handwriting in your yearbook. Okay, the way it's got a lefty smudge, it's like his hand brushed over the ink or something. Okay, let's say that you're right. Why would Nathan be impersonating Cole? Really? You don't believe me? No, I didn't say that. I'm just trying to figure out why Nathan would do this. I'm thinking you could help me out with that. And last, but not least, my room. You like? Best part of the tour. Your parents always leave you alone when they go out of town? You jealous? [chuckles] Don't know. Mine aren't so trusting. Can't say I blame them. [music thumping outside] [overlapping chatter] Where the hell is Cole? Probably just got tied up with something. I'm sure he'll be here soon. Don't say a fucking word. [screams] Don't you hate this? I know I did. [whimpering] But, no, my stepfather never stopped. You breathe one word of this to anyone, you're gonna wish you were never born. Nod if you understand. Help! No. [unbuckling] No, no, no. [muffled sob] [sobbing] Em, what's going on? Something wrong? I'm fine. Everything's fine, but I do have to go. Wait. Go? I just got here. Yes, but I really have to be going. Excuse me. Hey, what's wrong with her? No idea. Emily! EMILY: Leave me alone, Cole! PAUL: Hey. You really think I have the answer? Okay, I'm just as clueless as you are. Bullshit. What are you hiding? Are you gonna tell me, or do I have to go downstairs and ask Cole or Nathan or whoever the hell that is? Huh? Hey, guys, are you gonna join us for brunch? Cole made French toast. How does that sound? That sounds-- uh, sounds pretty damn good. Um, can you give us a minute? Sure. I found a gun in his room, Paul, a gun. Okay, that should be enough of an answer for you, help you figure out why he's here. Or maybe--maybe you don't want to figure it out. Figure what out? [exhales] I did something, man, something really bad. It was at a party at my parents' house. You were sick, and you couldn't make it. Emily showed up to meet Cole, but Cole was late. We were both drinking, and... we ended up in my room. Nathan's here for revenge, man. What the hell did you do, man? Look, I can tell that you're really messed up right now, but I'm your best friend. Let me help you. Help me? Nah, nah, it's too late for that, buddy. I'm screwed. HOLLIS: Guys, you coming? The food's gonna get cold. You should go, Paul. No. Talk to me. Paul, please. Just-- Just tell Sam I'll be down soon. I just need some alone time. Promise you're not gonna do something stupid. I promise. [exhales] [door opens] [door closes] COLE: Hon? Where have you been? I was shopping. Trying to distract me? Trying to be a thoughtful husband. You really don't want me to call off Nathan. Hon, look at me. Hon. Once Jacob is gone, everything will be so much better for you, for us. I mean, what Jacob did, though, wasn't entirely his fault. What happened to him when he was a kid, it could have scarred-- No! Enough about his stepdad. If you try hard enough, you can excuse anything. If someone should be punished for something so monstrous, shouldn't it be his stepdad? I mean, he's the root of all of this. And should I have the right to make this decision? How do you even know what the root is, what his father or his stepfather did to him? Why should you, should we believe Jacob in the first place? He would say anything to you to forgive himself. What, was that what he was like in high school, a liar? I don't--I don't remember. He was okay, I guess. That's not the point. He raped you and kept it a secret, so forget his stories, because the only thing you know without any doubt is what he did to you. Because what I really don't understand is why you kept it from me for so long. We had been married for four years, and then you wake up one night just crying inconsolably. I don't know. I just-- I thought that it would just go away on its own, that it would become unimportant with time and that... I didn't want to upset you. So when you finally did decide to tell me, that was when you knew it would not go away. That was when you knew you wanted revenge, right? Once you did tell me, you said that you could not think about anything else, that you were the one with anger, that you wanted him to die. And then, 24 hours ago, you change your mind. I know this has been hard for you, babe, and I'm sorry. Hon, we have to be decisive. We cannot keep living like this. Where are you off to now? There's a poker game at Winston's. I thought you stopped playing cards. Don't worry. We're not playing for serious coin. Hey, I need the distraction. I love you, babe, more than anything. Think I should go check on Jacob or leave him alone? Thought he'd be down by now. Is everything okay with you two? Yeah. It's just... [grunts] What? I don't know. Last night, after his big outburst, he just got kind of weird. How so? I don't know. He was talking about being trapped in some memory, feeling guilty. Memory about what? I don't know. He didn't say. Having a good time so far? Yeah. I'm really glad you invited me along, Paul. Yeah. You have no idea how good this feels. It's nice hanging out with friends for a change. What, no friends back home? That's hard to believe, Cole. Ah, work friends, sure, but nobody I share a meaningful history with. Yeah... Heh. history, memories, that's what high school is all about now. When was the last time you held that? Wow. Heh. It's been a while. Remember what you wrote me? Should, uh, refresh yourself. Last page. Huh. &quot;See you when I see you, man.&quot; [laughs] What's so funny? Uh, nothing. It's just... [laughs] Not something you'd expect your best friend to write? Was thinking maybe you could write something to take its place, something more reflective of our friendship. What do you say? Yeah. All right. [laughs] So since when did you start writing with your right hand? [laughing] What tipped you off? Jacob figured it out. Mm. Jacob. Why the hell are you pretending to be Cole? You really don't know? Maybe I wanted to hear it from you. When I went to prison for almost killing that dude that kicked my dog, that was just after Emily told Cole about Jacob raping her. Cole told me the news. I almost killed that old man, 'cause you know who I kept thinking I was beating up instead? Jacob. I got a real soft spot for Emily and everything that she's been though. And she's probably the only friend I can count on. I was just gonna show up at Jacob's house one day and kill him on the spot. I couldn't track him down. He keeps a low profile. Nothing in the phone book, online. It's as if he was a ghost. But then--Ha ha. Cole came up with the reunion idea. &quot;Paul doesn't lose touch with his best friends from high school. No way,&quot; Cole promised Emily. Sure enough... Look, if you think I'm gonna let you hurt my friend-- Oh, your friend? Your friend, mm. I didn't think best friends kept secrets from each other. Sometimes people keep secrets out of fear. Haven't you ever been afraid of something that just overwhelmed you? Your friendship aside, Jacob ruined Emily's life, my brother's, too. I couldn't let that slide. If you learned that someone very dear to you, someone in your family had been violated in the worst possible way, what would you do? I'd call the police. I'd let the law do what the law does. [laughs] &quot;Let the law do what the law does.&quot; Whew. Like that's gonna happen 10 years after the fact. I wouldn't take justice into my own hands. Yeah, well, you know, Cole don't agree with you, and now suddenly Emily can't make up her mind. But don't worry. I've already made up mine. I'm not gonna kill your little buddy. You have a gun. True. I do. But I've been thinking... life's not about the mistakes we make. Nah, it's about what we learn from 'em. My mom used to always say that to me. Heh. I think Jacob... has figured a lot of things out this weekend. You're really good, Nathan. You could fool anybody. Hmm. The way you told all of us your stories. Why should I believe you now? 'Cause if I was really gonna kill Jacob... I'd have already done it. Then why are you still here? When I was in prison, you know, I saw it all the time. It was this sudden awakening in someone. They finally realized what they did was wrong and that they couldn't undo it. Whew. Man, guilt is like a sword at your throat. Never know when it's gonna kill you. Me, I was a hothead. I didn't figure out shit, despite what my mom said. It took coming here, seeing Jacob in the flesh, talking to him. Really? Yeah, really. What happens to Jacob, then? Don't know. I think that move is up to him... and Emily. [sighs] Oh, what, you can give a beating, but can't take one? Ha ha. Have you guys seen Jacob? Uh, no. I figured he was with you guys. He should still be in his room. He said he was pretty beat, right? Yeah. Hey, you and Cole want to play? No. Thanks. Later. My turn? Uh-huh. What are you up to, Cole? Hey, Jacob. Are you okay in there? Hello? Hey, Jacob. Hey, Jacob. Jacob. Oh, shit. Sleeping pills. His pulse is steady. He didn't overdose. If you don't believe me, you can check for yourself. And now what? Wait for him to wake up. Shit. You wanna go for a walk? Yeah. It's really nice outside. Yeah, sure. Well, after this game. [chuckles] Hey, you're up. Mm. [pool balls clatter] [gasps] [laughs] My God. You changed. Yeah. [chuckles] I didn't like what I had on. Oh, I like it. You look good. Did you find Jacob? He still upstairs. Uh, yeah. Yeah. HOLLIS: Hey, can you grab me a water, too? Yeah, sure. We're gonna go for a walk. Do you wanna come? Yeah, I can't ditch my friends. They will have my head. Okay. Admire your loyalty. Uh, have fun. Don't talk to strangers. Okay. Still steady? Yeah. This is taking too long. I'm gonna call 911. No, look, you don't have to call anyone. He's gonna wake up sooner or later. Trust me. That's when it'll get interesting. [cell phone rings] [ring] [ring] Hey. It's okay. [ring] [ring] [ring] [ring] [ring] Oh, not stalling? Bullshit. Totally wimped out on me, brother. Where's the revolver Skip sold you? Huh? Well, what do you know? You really don't think I can do this job myself, do you? No, I don't. Turn around. Hey, Nathan. What the hell? Nathan. Nathan. Nathan. Nathan. Been a while, Paul. How you been? Where is he? Who? If I have to, I will kill you. Anyone who's best friends with that piece of shit deserves the same ending. Come on, Cole. I haven't seen you for, like, 10 years, and this is how you say hello? Take me to Jacob. No. I don't think so. So either you use that stupid gun, or put it away. [footsteps] Fuck. COLE: You fucking coward! PAUL: No! Cole! EMILY: Oh, my God. Baby, don't. Baby, stop. Cole, put the gun down. Baby, please don't do this. This is insane. Look at her, motherfucker. You destroyed her life. Why should I not kill you right now, huh? Doesn't have to be this way. Just put the gun down. Look at her, I said! I think you want to die, Jacob. Huh? Am I right? Huh? Tell me you wanna die. Tell me you want to die. I'm sorry for what I did... more than you'll ever know. Maybe you'll never forgive me. I don't blame you. But I don't want to die. PAUL: You heard him, Cole. Shut up, Paul! Son of a-- Baby, please. I love you, okay? This doesn't have to be this way. Give me the gun. It's okay, honey. Just give me the gun, okay? Let go. How does this end then, huh? We just let him go free? Rolling. Look at me when you talk... the whole time. Never take your eyes away. This is going online. My name... My name is Jacob Montgomery West. The following is my confession... to what occurred... to what I did... on the night of April 21, 2006. [instrumental playing]
