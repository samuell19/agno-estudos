[FUN BLUES SONG PLAYING] [POOL BALLS CRACK] ♪ Smokestack lightnin'' ♪ ♪ Shinin' just like gold ♪ ♪ Why don't you Hear me cryin'? ♪ ♪ Wah-ooh-ooh ♪ Hey, Jack. Mr. Duffy. Uh... this is Willie Stark from up Mason City. County treasurer. Glad to meet you. Jack Burden. From The Chronicle. Good to meet you, Mr. Burden. ALEX: Yeah, Willie's on business for Mason City. Bond issue them got up there. Gonna build a schoolhouse. Ooh. Yeah. Yeah, me and Willie was in school together. Oh, you was in school, Alex. I didn't know. Not the teacher's favorite, I don't expect. No, sir, that's true. Willie was, though. Still is, ain't you, Willie? Yeah, Willie married a schoolteacher. Well, you know... they tell me that schoolteachers are made with it in the same place as the rest. Now, is that right or not, Mr. Stark? Yeah, that's right. TINY: Slade! Beers all around. Not for me, thanks. Oh, that little schoolteacher don't like it when you drink? Well, she don't favor it, for a fact. [CHUCKLING] Well, beers all around. Well, I sell beer to those who want it. I don't make nobody drink 'em. ALEX: Well, maybe you got some orange pop for him. That's what he wants. Yeah, I think I'd like some orange pop. Two straws. [TYPEWRITERS CLACKING] Jack, get up Mason City. See who's this fella who thinks he's Jesus Christ come down off the cross to scourge the moneychangers out of that shinplaster courthouse they got 'em there. I know who he is. Fella with a Christmas tie pushed a school bond through. You know him? Met him. Watched him drink a bottle of orange pop once through two straws on account of a wife who don't favor drinking. She favor him stayin' parish treasurer? Don't you know how things are run up there? Run up there like they're run down here. Yeah? Well, you leave down here and run on up there. [TRAIN BELLS RINGING] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] JACK: As a commissioner, as chairman, I guess you're in a position to know the situation regarding the schoolhouse contract. Ain't no situation. Maybe not, but maybe so. Ain't any situation. Board took a bid offer. A.J. Moore's bid, the fella's name, schoolhouse gets built. This Moore fella's bid, I take it, was the lowest? Now, you lookie here. Ain't nobody tells a board what bid to take. Anybody can come along put in a little pissant bid. Board doesn't have to take it. Board takes somebody who can do the work right. Ain't nothin' done but legal. Who was it put in the little pissant bid? Name of Jeffers, if I recollect. Jeffers Construction? Yeah. Well, that's a real firm, a big firm. The board picks who can do the work right. That's all I got to say. Don't you wanna tell your mama you wanna see yourself shinin' in the table? No? All right. I wish I could have sold some to you. Be out of your way in a second here. And no brushes, you sure? I'm sure. All right. Thank you. Thank you for your time. Bye-bye. Mr. Stark. Why, Mr. Jack Burden, how are you, sir? JACK: People would think parish treasurer paid well enough a man wouldn't have to sell household fix-it kits door-to-door. People'd think. Doesn't in Mason City. Well, I'm maybe not so good at mathematics as some other parish treasurers you may've met. Or too good at it. How much they steal on the schoolhouse contract? Well, let's see... Jeffers come in $142,000. Moore, $175,000. That's $33,000 split six ways, 5500 per commissioner. And they done it so plain and pretty, well, you'd almost have to admire 'em. Just point out Jeffers uses nigra laborers, skilled men, you know? Next thing, it's, "Lookie here, "nigras making more money than you men. Pushing wheelbarrows, hauling dirt." And that's it. "Goodbye, Mr. Jeffers and your low bid. You go build your nigra schoolhouse somewhere else." Not that you didn't try and get people to see what was goin' on. Oh, I yelled so long and loud about these old boys linin' they pockets. I'm lucky to have any job in Mason City: Government, door-to-door or any other variety. I stood out there on that street corner, pencil in one hand, paper in the other, tryin' to show people the numbers. But you stop people out there in that hot sun, try to show 'em arithmetic, well, they can't see it so clear through the sweat pouring in they own eyes from they own hard labor. Especially if you put nigras in the equation. Why, you're likely to get beat up. Likely? Once or twice. You gonna run again in November? Nah, I'm all... I'm done. A lame duck. Lucy too. They got her fired from teaching. I don't care. I don't want to teach in a schoolhouse they built just so they can steal money. Right. You're looking at your own private two-person leper colony. Sippin' pop. So, what are you gonna do, then? I don't know. String my pa a fence, slop some pigs, milk some cows. [♪♪♪] I'm gonna keep the faith, Mr. Burden, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna keep the faith in the people, because you know why? Time... brings all things to light. I trust it's so. [♪♪♪] [MAN SPEAKING IN LATIN] [MAN SPEAKING IN LATIN] [SPEAKING IN LATIN] Joe. Did you get a photograph of him? Who? JACK: The next mayor of this town. [THUNDER RUMBLES] TINY: You know what people are sayin'? People are sayin' that God himself had a hand in this schoolhouse business. That God stepped in on Willie Stark's side. Yes, sir. He does work in mysterious ways sometimes. Sometimes... he has somebody else do it. Sends over a fat man in a striped suit with a big car to do his will. Well, I have had some worse employers, I admit that. What you want? Well, I wanna work for you, Mr. Stark. And you wanna work for the people, unless I been misinformed. People vote me, I'd be privileged to serve 'em. What, as the--? The county treasurer? Yes, sir. Mr. Stark, you could run for mayor of Mason City, and you could win without climbing out of bed in the morning. You just put the word out about Willie Stark, who tried to take on the crooks single-handed. Willie Stark, who tried to warn us. Willie Stark, who could've saved our kids if we'd have just listened. Now, I'm not talkin' about Willie Stark for the mayor of Mason City. No, sir. I'm talkin' about Willie Stark... as the next governor... of the great state of Louisiana. Now, you saw a man holding out a handful of cash to you, and you said no. This is what I see. I see a man in a booth lookin' down at a ballot, a workin' man. And he sees three names there: Harrison, MacMurphy and Stark. Now, what this man really sees is that picture in the newspaper of them three little coffins and the one man since the great Governor Stanton died that had the guts to buck the powers that killed 'em. Now, that man, that votin' man, he's got a pencil, he checks a box, you wake up governor. And that little lady lyin' beside you, the one that don't... ...favor liquor... she wakes up the governor's wife. That's what I see. Now, why don't you take a minute with your orange pop, see if you can't see it too... ...governor. [ACCORDIONS PLAYING FESTIVE ZYDECO MUSIC] [PLAYING ZYDECO MUSIC] You got your speech? Huh? Yeah. All right. Willie Stark! [APPLAUSE] Thank you, folks. [MUSIC STOPS] Thank you kindly. [CROWD CHATTERING] My name's Willie Stark from Mason City yonder. And I'm pleased to have a chance to talk with you all here today. Now, friends, what I wanna talk about is something that's been troubling me. Coffee, please. WOMAN: Yes, ma'am. Can I sit with you? Or anything else. No, thanks. You don't like my looks? I don't care about anybody's looks, but I can't recall ever going for anyone who reminds me of a box of spilled spaghetti. Miss Burke, I'm sitting here having a cup of coffee. I'm almost through, then you couldn't sit with me, which is what you asked for. Sorry. Not working for Sen-Sen Puckett anymore. Now, he wasn't a bad-looking fellow. Heel. Well, sure, politically and elsewise. Who didn't know that? I guess I'm slower on some things than others. Like you. Am I? I think so. I think not. Not on this charade. That's the topic of the interview. Then tell me, if you're so smart. All right. Harrison's a city man, MacMurphy's a cracker. Not a cracker precisely, but enough of one to worry Harrison that crackers won't know the difference. So Harrison looks for someone to split the cracker vote. Hears about an honest man up in Crackerville where some cracker kids go down with a fire escape that was supposed to be stuck with more than spit to their schoolhouse. Sends his man Tiny Duffy up there to romance him and then Sadie Burke to romance him some more. Both telling him how good he is, how he has better than a chance in hell to change things in this state, where nothing will ever change. 'Cause you and Tiny and the rest of 'em don't care how much of a fool you make a man. And you do care, I suppose? I didn't say that. I don't care. If I did, I'd do something about it, wouldn't I? No, I'd rather watch from here. Like passin' a car crash. I know you all can't see this from all the way back there, but I've got a pie chart representin' it. And you can see here where public welfare and hospitals end up. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] [TYPEWRITER DINGS] [SIGHS] [WILLIE TALKING INDISTINCTLY] WILLIE: --should be the same. Rather, the ratio... [SCOFFS] [♪♪♪] [THUNDER RUMBLING] We should go. Not yet. Let's go in again. You don't wanna swim? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [DOOR OPENS] Hey. How you think we doin'? Fine, I guess. You think? That how you reportin' it? Sure. Seems to me they listen less and less the further I get from home. Well, that makes sense, don't you think? Maybe... ...you tryin' to say too much. I'm tellin' 'em what they need to know: Taxes, wages, highways. Well, maybe it's how you're telling them. Maybe if you told 'em the way you tell Lucy or Tiny or me or anyone face to face, they'd listen better. I don't know how that is. Hard to know how you sound to somebody else. Mad, fed up, like you mean business is how you sound. But not on the platform. You climb three steps, and you sound just like the rest of 'em. Like a man who wants to win an election. Willie... Yeah? What? Nothing. Well, a man don't have to be governor. I don't deny wantin' it. I won't lie to you, I lie awake wantin' it. But sometimes a man can want somethin' so bad, be so full of want, he plain forget what it is he want. I could have been a good governor. A lot better than them other fellas. But I ain't gonna be governor. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hi. Come on in. Why not? Oh, Mr. Stark. Sadie. What's up? Willie here was just telling me how he's not gonna be governor. You told him? No, I didn't, as a matter of fact, no. Told me what? Told...me...what? Oh. [LAUGHS] Oh, yeah, well, that makes sense. I see. So that's true? I'm being used. So they tell me. I saw it in his eyes the first time he come to see me, Tiny. But I just pushed it out of my head. Pushed it clean out. [CHUCKLES] I should've known better. [SIGHS] [CHUCKLES] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] SADIE: Mr. Stark? [KNOCKING] Mr. Stark? [SIGHS] You thought you were the little white lamb of God, didn't you? Just waitin' for the chance to stand on your hind legs and make a speech. They would've paid you to play the part. They pay me. But you were too stupid to see even that. You did it for free. You're just their dumb sacrificial sap, and I'm... I'm sorry I let them. [CALLIOPE PLAYING CHEERFUL MUSIC] Your stomachaches, your colics, your bloats, your diarrhea. Even the fistulae... MAN: Boy, you get yourself up here right now. Come see the two-headed snake. Two-headed snake, right here. The show is about to start. Step right up to see the two-headed snake. You're looking a little peaked. I can't imagine. Slept like a baby. Mm-hmm. [BAND PLAYING HAPPY MARCH] Got your speech? All right, then. Let's go. It's time. "Hail, Hail, The Gang's All Here." What? The song. Yeah. That's what it is. Hello. Hello. How are you? Here's that speech you was just asking about. My name is Willie Stark. From Mason City yonder. I had a speech... about this state and what it needs. There's no use in me tellin' you about it. You are the state. You know what you need. Look at the knees of your pants. Look at your crops. Look at your kids. You got holes and rot and ignorant offspring on account of this state. Well, I had a speech, but I ain't got it no more. Mr. Duffy got it now in his fat little hands. Don't you, Tiny? Go ahead, show the people. Hold it up. Well, since-- Since he got it, I'm gonna have to say something else. It's all right. Because I got something else to say. I got a story... about a redneck hick. He's like yourselves, if you please. Well, this fella, awhile back, this hick... started thinkin' about all the other hicks, what he could do for 'em. Well, one day... it came down... with the powerful force of God's own hand! When the only brick schoolhouse ever built in his parish collapsed on account of it was built with politics-rotted brick. And it killed and mangled a batch of poor, young scholars. Oh, you know this story. You heard it. He fought the politics that built that schoolhouse with rotten brick and bolts. But he lost. He lost. And it fell. It fell. Well, it wasn't long before some public officials from the city rode out in their big fine car and told this hick how they wanted him to run for governor. Them in them striped pants told me MacMurphy was a limberback, Joe Harrison, he-- He was just a tool of the city machine. And they wanted this nobody, do-gooder hick to step in, give 'em some honest government. You know who they were? In that big fine car? They was Joe Harrison's own lickspittles coming in to split MacMurphy's hick vote! That's right! Your hick vote! There he is! There he is right there. There's the Judas Iscariot lickspittle nose-wiper from the city, right there. Come on, Tiny. Look at him. Joe Harrison's dummy. Come on, take a bow. Come on. No, come on now, people wanna see you. Take a bow, come on. Ah! Oh! And there he goes! [CROWD GASPS] No! No, let him lie! Let him lie! Let that hog lie in his own filth! Let him lie, but listen to me, you hicks. That's right, I'm not the only one here. You hicks too. They fooled you too, just like they fooled me a thousand times. But it's time I fooled somebody. It's time I fooled them. Them big-city, striped-pants, lickspittle hick-haters. I'm runnin' for governor on my own. I'm coming for 'em, and I'm coming for blood! [CHEERING] First thing I'm gonna do is build me a road out here across the swamps and alligators and anything else that gets in my way. A thousand miles of concrete, if that's what it takes, so I can come out here and visit with my fellow hicks on a regular basis. Then I'm gonna build me a bridge across that mighty Mississippi. Name it after myself, 'cause I'm the one who built it. Then I'm gonna build you all new schools. Send your kids home with free tablets and pencils and books to study and learn on the way to the new university I'm gonna build, where every one of 'em can go. Same as rich folks' kids. Now, I hope you're listening, you hicks. 'Cause I don't wanna drive all the way back home just to drive back out here next week to tell you again. And this is it: If you don't vote, you don't matter. You don't matter! You don't matter! And then you're just as ignorant as them in the city say you are while they stealin' the food off your table and every last nickel out your pocket, sayin', "Thank you, please." Because then you are just a bunch of ignorant hicks who got nothin'... 'cause you deserve nothin'. So listen to me. Listen here. Lift your eyes, and look on the God's blessed and unflyblown truth: You are a hick! And ain't nobody never helped a hick but a hick hisself. It's up to you to nail these parasites up. Up to you and me and God. WOMAN: Amen! Nail up Joe Harrison! CROWD: Nail him up! Nail up MacMurphy! CROWD: Nail him up! And nail up any bastard that gets between you and the roads and the bridges and schools and the food you need. You give me the hammer, and I'll do it! I'll nail their hides to the barn door! Nail 'em up! CROWD: Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! CROWD: Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! [CROWD CHEERING] [♪♪♪] CROWD: Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! Nail 'em up! WILLIE: Get out there and vote, now. More about Stark? He's colorful. Makes it easy. You know me, always lookin' for easy. Jack. You know what The Chronicle line is on the election. Sure. MacMurphy again because of his brilliant record as an administrator and high integrity as a statesman. Now, why can't you put more of that in your column, a little less of Stark's ravin' madness? Listen, Jack. I know Stark's a friend of yours, but-- He's not a friend of mine. Personally, I don't care who's governor. But are you telling me what to write, or am I mistaken? You know The Chronicle line. All right. What do you mean, "All right"? I mean it the way I said it. [♪♪♪] [CROWD CHEERING] WILLIE: I, Willie Stark, do solemnly swear that I will support the constitution and laws of the state of Louisiana. JACK: Willie didn't need me to get himself elected. He won by a landslide. By the biggest margin in the history of the state. WILLIE: ...all the duties incumbent upon me as governor, so help me God. JACK: Which isn't to say everyone voted for him. Jack, get up Mason City. JACK: My editor didn't vote for him. Thinks he's Jesus Christ come down off the cross. JACK: The publisher of this paper didn't vote for him. These men didn't vote for him. Or these. The governor's education bill does not pass. JACK: Or the old boys in the Senate who were in the pockets of the oilmen. My mother didn't vote for him. [CHUCKLES] This is my mother. She doesn't vote. Over there, on her dressing table, that's her with her first husband. First of four, if I recollect. And that's my godfather on the right, the best man. He didn't vote for Willie either. In fact, I think it's safe to say nobody from where I'm from voted for Willie Stark. And why should they? His promises to the poor to build roads and bridges and schools were a declaration of war on the rich. They wanted him out. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] You Jack Burden? I've come at the behest of the boss. Who? The boss? The governor? Oh. [CHUCKLES] MAN: Governor, let me put it in simple words so you understand: There's no money for all these things you wanna do for the poor. Oh, there's money, senator. You're wrong there. There's plenty. Nothing but money. Every kilowatt comes out of the river, every barrel of oil comes out of the ground. But that doesn't belong to you, sir. That's right. Don't belong to you either, or them. Belongs to the state. How about the state don't tax just 5 percent to build my roads? We take it all. These are some powerful companies you talkin' about takin' money from. They ain't gonna stand for it. They ain't the power. The power's in the hands of the powerless, and those hands have handed it to me. Realistically, they'll approve half the money, maybe. And that's after we beat 'em up. So we build 'em half a highway. Mile of concrete, mile of dirt, mile of concrete, mile of dirt, all the way to Shreveport. Now, how's anybody gonna drive on that, huh? People ain't gonna stand for that. TINY: They like their roads finished. That's right. What's right? Hey, Jack. Sadie, take Tiny out of here, explain it to him. He just said it, and he don't get it. Come on. You want something to eat? No, thank you. WILLIE: Well, sit down. Hi, Sadie. Hey. I heard you got fired. Oh, you heard wrong. I quit. Well, that's smart. Time I get done with that outfit, they ain't gonna be able to pay you, nor the nigger who sweeps the floor. You want a job? Working for whom? The state? Hell, no. Me. You, me, Sadie, Tiny. Tiny? I was surprised to hear Tiny was back. Well, somebody gotta be lieutenant governor. Yeah, sure. I keep Tiny around... to remind me of something I never wanna forget. And that is? When they come around sweet-talking, don't listen. Never again. What would I be doin'...for you? Sweet-talkin'. [♪♪♪] MAN: All right, everybody. WOMAN: Well, what on earth is that? This is a ballista. WOMAN: A what? Jack will tell you all about it. Jack, come on. Tell them. It's a pre-gunpowder weapon fired with the tension of animal sinew. Oh, my God. [CREAKING] Jack? Right. Uh, see the eagle on top of the clock? One... Two... [SCREAMS] Oh. Ah. Oh. [LAUGHS] WOMAN 2: They say you're in politics, Mr. Burden? It must be fascinating to be in politics. It's not, I assure you. Well, they say you're very influential. It must be fascinating to be very influential. I honestly wouldn't know. MAN: Don't let him kid you, Miss DuMonde. My godson Jack is very influential. Like when he was a newspaperman. All right, then, yes, I'm influential. Any pals in the pen anyone wants pardoned, I'll put in the word. Well, there is gonna be somebody in the pen. Before it's over, what's going on there? All these wild goings-on. Fella givin' away the state. Free this, free that, free the other. Every wool-hat jackass thinkin' the world is free. Who's gonna pay? That's what I wanna know. Who's he think's gonna pay? Standard Oil and the utility companies, I imagine. And anyone else that can afford to pay their share. You and me, George. We'll pay. Government's committed these days, givin' services we never heard of back when. Mm-hmm. And he's gonna tax this state to death. Drive business right out. You don't think it boils down to this: If the government, for quite a long time back now, had been doing anything for the people, they wouldn't have got fed up and elected Mr. Stark. Well, you ask him this next time you see him: Ask him how much grabbin' there is, all that money flowin'. Then you ask him what's he gonna do when they impeach him. There's a constitution in this state, or was, before he blew it to hell. I'll be sure to ask him. You do that. Jack, Miss DuMonde plays the piano. That's nice. [PIANO PLAYING BEETHOVEN'S "FUR ELISE"] You weren't like yourself today, son, like you used to be. Mother, if I'm ever like I used to be, do me a favor and shoot me. Who was that at lunch anyway? Mr. Peyton. You've known him all your life. He builds electrical plants or some such. The girl, Mother. Miss DuMonde. That's Mr. Orton's sister's child, and she will inherit his money. Somebody ought to wait until she inherits it, then marry her and drown her in her bathtub. Oh, don't worry, I'd like to drown her, but I won't. Was Mr. Peyton sayin' those people you're with are mixed up in some sort of graft? Graft's what you call it when who's doin' it doesn't know which fork to use. Well, whatever you call it. Because I worry to think that-- I don't know. How would I, careful as I am not to know what anybody anywhere is doing at any time? Oh, Jack, make a note. Find out where they got Senator Tucson's boy locked up. What's his name? The boy? Hell, I don't remember. Find out when's the trial, get a lawyer down there. JACK: Who? Evans? Not Evans. Find somebody with less oil in his hair, and don't look like he sing with a band. WILLIE: Put one of your pals on it. You any idea who it was got cut? I don't care if it was the sainted aunt of the Apostle Paul. Well, I just happen to know. Uh, fella's son of a doctor, paper said. They're pretty important around here, you know, a doctor in the country. They, uh, think they're somebody. And, uh, maybe it gets out you're trying to fix it to get the boy off. Wouldn't do you any good. Now, it appears to me, maybe-- Tiny, you don't know a goddamn thing. Had you been listening. I told Jack to prime the lawyer through a pal. Find somebody who don't need to see his name in lights. That way, nobody knows who picked him wasn't me. Might as well been the pope himself far as anybody knows. All right. I get you. Yeah, just barely. [HANK WILLIAMS' "LONG GONE LONESOME BLUES" PLAYING] ♪ I went down to the river ♪ ♪ To watch The little fish swim by ♪ Hey, there, Pop. How you doin', son? How you making out? Oh, I'm gettin' along. Good to see you. You looking good. [BOTH CHUCKLE] I brought the infantry here. Oh. How are you? More prettier than ever. Hey, Grandpa. How you doin', buddy? How's the arm? He gonna be all-American. I know he is. I know he is. All right, governor, sir, here we go. One, two... [BIRDS CHIRPING] [GLASS BREAKS] Bastard. [PIGS SNORTING] Give me a slug. Pa don't favor drinkin'. Used to be Lucy didn't favor it. [GUNSHOT, GLASS BREAKS] I don't know what she do or don't favor no more. Not that it matters. Yeah, I must have poured 10,000 gallons of swill in them troughs. Still doin' it. Pourin' swill. Some things never change. [GUNSHOTS IN DISTANCE] [CHICKENS CLUCKING] Hey. What's up? Judge Irwin. Judge Irwin what? [PANTING] Spill it. I'll spill it when I have my breath. You're usin' it up explainin' you don't have it. You think it's funny? You won't when I tell you. You tell me later. Byram rang up. He said the afternoon papers have got the judge saying the allegations warrant a full-on investigation. Two-timin' bastard. That two-timin' bastard. [GUNSHOT] Clear 'em out. Tiny was figurin' on having supper up here. Clear 'em all out. [GUNSHOT] [♪♪♪] Which way up there? Jack, tell Sugar how to get to the house. It's your people live down here. [♪♪♪] JACK: Suppose he don't open up? Make him. What I pay you for? IRWIN: Yeah, who is it? It's Jack. Jack? Well, I'll be. Hey, come on in. You're not in any trouble, are you? No, Jack's not in any trouble. Matter of fact, he doin' all right, all things considered. WILLIE: I trust you don't mind if Jack pours me a slug. I didn't know his duties ran to those of manservant, but if I'm mistaken, I'm sorry. Oh, hell. Sometimes Jack pours me a drink, sometimes I pour him one. Sometimes I pour myself one. I could pour you one. No, thank you. WILLIE: This today's? Yeah, I don't get much time to read the papers, rushin' around the state doin' the good work. Well, perhaps, I can relieve your curiosity on one point. Somewhere in there's my opinion on the severity of the allegations against you, if that's of interest. Somebody told me that. But you know how rumor hath a thousand tongues. And how them newspaper boys, they can exaggerate some. IRWIN: It's no exaggeration. WILLIE: Yeah, I see. Well, if you're clear on that and finished with your drink, I'd appreciate it if you'd just get the heck out of my house. Hey, thank you, judge, I think I will have just one more spot. So I see it there in the paper, and I hear you say it, but are you sure you took it to the Lord in prayer? I settled it in my mind. See, that's unsettling. Because if I recollect right, I recollect that... when we had our little conversation in town that time you sort of felt like what MacMurphy and his boys were sayin' about me was... beneath contempt. I made no commitment to you or to them, only to my conscience. I beg your pardon, your what? [CHUCKLES] I beg yours. Judge, you been toilin' around politics too long to use a word like "conscience" so easily. No, my change of conscience came when certain features of your, uh, public services, shall we say, came to my attention. Somebody dug something up for you, huh? In the dirt? Yeah, not just one thing, and...not very deep. Oh, well, dirt's a funny thing. Ain't nothing but dirt on God's green earth, except what's under the water. And that's dirt too, come to think of it. Dirt makes the grass green. Let it breathe. The diamond on my wife's finger ain't nothing but dirt got awful hot. What are we but dirt blowed off the hands of God almighty? You and me and George Washington. And Jack there. Still doesn't alter the fact. I'm not trying to alter anything, just illuminate it. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. You saying MacMurphy and his bunch, yellin' for my impeachment, they're responsible, law-abidin' men? Yeah, they're responsible all right, to Alta Power and oil companies and the rest of them thieves. I wouldn't know about that. Only way to not know is to not wanna know. I'm retired, Mr. Stark. A reporter asked my opinion, and I gave it. If you was retired, no reporter would wanna ask you anything. What you say matters. A lot more than you pretend it don't. So I'm askin' you... call off the dogs. Asking is different than telling, and that sounded like telling to me. Didn't it to you, Jack? You been a judge a long time. Yes, I have. How'd it feel, do you think... ...to not be one no more? [CHUCKLES] No man has ever been able to intimidate me. I said what I said, and I see no reason to say or think anything different. Despite your expositions on laws and men, sir. Suit yourself. You're right, Jack. He don't scare easy. Judge, it's more in pain than wrath I go. WILLIE: Let's go. It's past Sugar Boy's bedtime. Your employer is calling you, Jack. I wouldn't go around advertising this visit to anyone. In case you change your mind. [♪♪♪] [TIRES SCREECHING] Bastard. Well, Jackie, you got a job cut out for you. MacMurphy. No, the judge. You bring down the lion, the rest of the jungle will quake in fear, and they'll all fall into line. I won't find anything. Oh, yes, you will. A man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud. You'll find somethin'. And make it stick. [♪♪♪] JACK: Apart from pleasin' the boss, I could see little advantage in finding anything beyond what was already known about Judge Irwin. What was known, was that he was kind to you when your father left you and your mother without saying why. What was known, was that he taught you the things your father should have: How to be a gentleman. How to firmly shake a hand. How to safely load a shotgun and lead a duck if you wanted to hit it. [BIRDS CHIRPING] What was known... ...was that he was more of a father to you than your real father... ...who you didn't know at all. [SEDUCTIVE MUSIC PLAYING] Hold it, please. Governor's penthouse. WILLIE: How you doin' diggin' something up on Judge Irwin? Nothin'. Nothin'. Found nothin' or done nothin'? I told you there's nothing to find. I could dig to China, wouldn't find anything. And I'm not framing him. Framing? Ain't nobody talkin' about framing. That's never necessary. The truth is always sufficient. You just find the truth. It's a waste of time and money. Jesus, doesn't anybody listen to what I say anymore? You don't wanna do it, don't do it. Or are you just lookin' for a raise? I'm gonna give you $100 raise whether you want it or not. If I wanted more money, I'd make it. You gonna tell me you work for me for love? I don't know why I work for you, but it ain't for love or money. Well, that's right, it's not. And you don't know why. But I do. Why? Boy, you work for me because I'm the way I am, and you the way you are, and that's just an arrangement founded in the natural order of things. [CHUCKLES] She sure could skate. [SKATES SCRAPING ICE] WILLIE: Right now, hidden away in chambers, not out here in the open like you and me, there's a legislature full of hyena-headed, belly-draggin' sons of bitches, sittin' around trying to figure out how to impeach me. [CROWD GRUMBLING] Now, they say it's 'cause I got crooks on the payroll. I say, "Is that all?" Course I got 'em. I got a can of oil in the garage too, 'cause there ain't a machine made by man don't need a squirt of that from time to time just to keep runnin'. [LAUGHTER] But my crooks... ...unlike theirs, are all atremble to be...too crooked. They're itty-bitty compared to their crooks in there. The Standard Oil and the power companies. Besides, I got my eye on mine. Ain't nobody watchin' over these crooks. Ain't nobody got their eye on 'em, while they rob the resources of this state. [CROWD CHEERING, CAMERAS SNAPPING] Who made that son of a bitch what he is? Who made him governor? And he goes and two-times me? I'll kill him. No, he's two-timing Lucy. You need some other kind of arithmetic [CHUCKLES] for what he's doing to you. Lucy, she's a fool. She's... I don't know what. His wife. A hick with a college degree from some Baptist hole in the ground. What was she like? [SIGHS] I didn't know Lucy any further back-- The slut on skates. I don't know, I was lookin' at her skates. Sure you were. [SIGHS] Was she pretty? Look, just forget it. How young was she? Who cares? Look at me. SADIE: He'll be back. The world is full of sluts on skates. [DOOR OPENS] Skates, grass skirts, geisha outfits.

Savannah money. The daughter of an industrialist out there. He's clean, Willie. He's washed in the blood. You call yourself a detective. I'm most certainly not-- The son of a bitch is washed in whitewash. Wanting it isn't the same as being it. I know. I can feel it. That isn't the same either. Where did you find this itty-bitty out? Hall of Records. It's all there. Marriage licenses, property deeds, public record. The public record is for the public, not us. That's why it's called that. You ain't gonna find nothing there. Now, I told you to dig, not scuff your shoe a little bit. You gotta get out there and talk to 'em. To who? The public. The people who knew him. This was a long time ago. Well, look, he's still alive, isn't he? Causin' trouble. So you gotta get out there and chafe up your hands a little bit, for chrissake, like the rest of us. Where the hell is everybody? JACK: Whatever there was to find in the case of the upright judge would be long-buried in the past like a dead cat in the back yard. [♪♪♪] But what could be buried there like that... ...in a place like Burden's Landing? Where you and your friends grew up, shaded by 300-year-old live oaks and the sense of your own entitlement. To dig around that past, in that back yard... you must first-- You tell yourself. --seek out the girl from that past: Anne Stanton. The daughter of the governor back then. The little sister of your best friend, Adam. Who, one day, you noticed, and it struck you kind of all of a sudden... wasn't little anymore. She was the first one you loved like that. And the last, it turns out. So you hold on to her pictures in your mind, year after year, in the belief that...someday it'll be like that again, even though you have no evidence. In church, they call this faith. So that's what I'll call it. Every month or so, I come out here and light a fire. Dry the place out. I know it doesn't really accomplish that, but... I got a feeling if I didn't, if nobody ever came, the place would just one day cave in on itself. Adam never comes out? No. Not anymore. He took the piano, or someone did. Took it and put it in that place he's living. Have you seen it? God forbid my brother ever spent any money on himself. Or that people knew it. How's your wife? I'm sorry, I've...forgotten her name. That didn't quite work out as I'd hoped. A lot of tangled bedclothes and unspoken loathing, then spoken loathing and no tangled bedclothes. Didn't I read of your engagement in the society column? Which you know I always turn to first in the paper. I was engaged. More than once. Adam didn't care for any of them. Hmm. But why that should matter, I don't know. Who needs them, anyway? ♪ If it ain't love Why should I be in love? ♪ JACK: Anne, way back, was Judge Irwin ever broke? What? Judges don't make the kind of money your father did, or my father or anyone else who lives around here. Why on earth would you wanna know such a thing? Someone asked me, and I didn't know. Asked you what? What I just asked you. Why? Oh, Jack, what're you doin' for that man? That man. Whatever it is, don't. That man is what those pushed away from the trough call him. Those invited to it should find another name. Accepting state money for scholarships is different from being on his payroll. Is it? Yes, it is. Oh, don't ruin it. What? Don't ruin this? Or that fine, beautiful time we all had here once? You sure that's what it was? Yes. Then why did it turn into this time? With me drinkin' myself to death. Adam gettin' more reclusive and strange, and you once a month comin' out to a house with the electricity cut off? This time came from that time. We should go. The fire can burn. It will anyway, you know, one day. What will what anyway? Cave in on itself. Everything. [♪♪♪] Is the Seaboard Bank in Savannah? Not since 1938. What happened in '38? Bought out by Georgia Fidelity. Got any idea who was president then? Franklin Roosevelt. Ma'am, of the bank. LeMoyne Carruthers was my friend. A dear friend. And his daughter, Mabel, well, I did what I could for her, even after her... financial reversal. The year of her financial reversal was roughly what? She threw that inheritance away! Two or three notes I paid myself. For the memory of LeMoyne, my dear friend. But she'd come back at me without shame and say, "I want money." For parties and balls and to adorn herself. For she was plain, to be kind. WILLIE: Then she was broke when she met the judge. Mm-hmm, so was he. This is when he was still attorney general under Governor Stanton pullin' down 3400 a year, while paying off liens on his place on the Row to the tune of 42,000. Well, you see there, you are a detective. You dug and chinked the metal box, and are enjoying the sound of it a bit, if I'm not mistaken. Might still be empty. No, it's full. Crawlin' with maggots by now, maybe, but... still a little something they was chewin' on. You just have to look. Still have to find the key. And that ain't gonna be easy. Well, there's nothin' easy that means anything. You'll do it. I have faith. I like this one, Slade. WILLIE [OVER SPEAKERS]: Now, they all is yellin' that I got no right to what's on their table. What's on their table is theirs. I'm not tryin' to take it! "Go ahead, sit down at that table," I tell. "Have all you want to eat. Eat till you can't eat no more. "Now, what's left on that table... "when you can't eat no more, even if you tried, "leave that there 'cause that's for the rest of us." [CROWD CHEERING] And for that, they're tryin' to ruin me. For takin' what they left on the table and usin' it to build somethin' for you! To build 3000 miles of paved highways, 111 new bridges, 208 new schools, 60,000 brand-new jobs! [CHEERING] Now, they wanna ruin me... ...'cause they wanna ruin you. But your will is my strength. Your need is my justice. And I won't let them! [PEACEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] WILLIE: Come to me...in a dream. Whilst you were up in Savannah with your pail and shovel, eatin' oysters. JACK: What did? I'm gonna build me... the best-staffed, best-equipped, biggest goddamn health center this state ever saw. This country ever saw. The-- The All-Father hisself. You want me to do what to further this noble enterprise? Deliver me my chief of staff. Fine. You give me a list of who you're thinkin' to run it. Only one name on it: Dr. Adam Stanton. That's my boy, Tom! That's the way! You see that? That's an all-American pass. Goddamn it. Thattaboy, Tom! Well, somebody gotta run this hospital. He's gotta be the best, don't he? Adam Stanton is not the best. Well, he is for what I need. They'll never approve the money otherwise. Willie, Adam's an old friend of mine. As I certainly know, else I wouldn't be asking. I know him and I know you. He won't do it. What's wrong with me? To him, what isn't? You're everything his father fought against. He hates what you represent, if not you yourself. I'm not askin' him to love me. I'm askin' him to run a hospital. Your hospital. The people's hospital, where any poor redneck and nigger can get the best there is without payin' a dime for it. He oughta like that. No. What you're askin' is for him to put his family's name next to yours. So you can trot him out in front of recalcitrant senators and say: "Lookie here, lookie who I got standin' next to me. "No less than the son of the most honorable man who ever served this state." Just get him. Not easy bein' the son of a great man. Don't look so hard for my boy Tom out there. Far as you know. [♪♪♪] We should go. Not yet. Let's go in again. JACK: The friend of your youth... is the only friend you'll ever have. For he doesn't really see you. He sees in his mind a face, which doesn't exist anymore. And speaks a name, Spike, Bud, Red, Rusty... Jack... that belongs to that now nonexistent face. He's still the young idealist you used to be. Still sees good and bad in black and white, and men as sinners or saints, but never both. Hey, Adam. And feels superior in the knowledge, that you no longer can distinguish the two. Jack. That's what drives you to it, to try to stick the knife in. Come on in. For there's a kind of snobbery in failure. Like the twist to the mouth of a drunk. You're lookin' good, Jack. Thank you. I'll take that as a compliment. Been playin' much? Who wants to know, my sister? It was just a question. Everything good? Yes, Jack, everything's good. All right. I'm gonna tell you something, and I don't want you to start yellin' at me until I'm finished. Governor Stark wants you as director of the new medical center he's buildin'. Whatever you want, all you have to do is say, it's yours. Money? I didn't say that. What do I want money for? I got everything I want. Look around. I didn't say money. Then what? What's next when that doesn't work? A threat of some kind? Of course not. That's how he gets things done, isn't it? What he relies on? The bribe and the threat? I would never do that to you, or let anyone else. You know that. Well, I don't know what you think he's thinkin', Jack, or what you're thinkin', but couldn't be flattery. He's thinkin' what he thinks about anybody he wants somethin' from who doesn't wanna give it. Something from their past. You just said he wasn't. Not their past, their weakness. Same thing. No, it isn't. I'm not gonna debate it with you, Jack. We're not in school anymore. And I don't care if you know I'm right. I don't care if I am right. But I am. Then what is it, Jack? What is my weakness? You can't look at anybody with somethin' broke without wantin' to fix it. And that's a weakness? Some would say. You would say. It's no disgrace. Well, then tell me, Jack. Tell me, please. How is that a weakness? I don't need to tell you. I think you do. No, if you don't know, I'll leave you to think about it. It'll come to you. No, it won't, Jack. And you'll have to go to your boss, and tell him that you failed without takin' out the big guns. So tell me, for your sake, how is that a weakness? 'Cause it makes you do things you don't wanna do. If they're good. And this is. He may not be. But this is. [SCOFFS] It's good to see you, Adam. WILLIE: Now, before I tell y'all the story about how this great university... changed the life of a boy from Mason City, who, by all rights, should still be swillin' hogs... [LAUGHTER] ...first, I'm gonna set your minds at ease on another point of interest. I brung my checkbook with me. You own one share? I do. I just bought it. Now, that gives me the right as a stockholder, to view the company's equity records, doesn't it? [APPLAUSE] MAN: Governor, sir? [♪♪♪] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Miss Littlepaugh? [LATCH CLICKS] You're from the insurance company. No, no. I'm not. But I know about your brother's insurance policy. Not that there was much left on it to collect. He borrowed against it almost down to nothing. Didn't he? Which means you lied... for almost nothin'. Now, don't you go jumpin' out a window. LITTLEPAUGH: It wasn't the money. It was the disgrace. I wanted him buried in the good part of the cemetery, not in the back with all the sinners. Why'd he kill himself? They drove him to it. Make room for that thief, Irwin. My brother went to the Justice Department, and told 'em he knew all about their man Irwin, and the bribes. But they wouldn't listen. Are you lyin' to me? No, that's what killed him. He wrote the letter to me and told me. [TEARFULLY] And then that night, he... [SOBBING] All right, wait. What letter? The letter he wrote me explainin' it all. The lawsuit Irwin was paid to let up on, and how the power company hid the payoffs by firin' my brother and givin' Irwin his job. Where's this letter now? What happened to it? Oh, I have it. Kept it all this time? You have the letter here? [♪♪♪] WILLIE: You bring down the lion, the rest of the jungle will quake in fear, and they'll all fall into line. Your employer is calling you, Jack. Thank you. [PLAYING PLEASANT BLUES MELODY] [MUSICIAN HUMMING] Hello. Hello, Anne. [CHUCKLES] What's that? Orange soda. Two straws. I think I might want somethin' else. I didn't say one of them was for you. It's the way it's drunk. Tradition. I know you went to see Adam. I did. What of it? What did you say to him? I went there, and I offered him a job. No use blamin' me. I'm not blamin' you. Well, that's what it sounds like. That's what you sound like. If you could hear yourself. I want him to take it. I want you to go back and ask him again. Jack, you know how it is. My brother is the son of a governor, the grandson of a senator, the great-grandson of a general. JACK: She wasn't tellin' me anything I didn't already know about Adam. But she was doin' it walkin' next to me... which is all that mattered. ...my face in that picture... So I let her go on... as long as she wanted. He's given up findin' him. [PLAYING PENSIVE MELODY] I knew that Adam had already made his decision. He had decided to take the job when I first brought it up. He was just puttin' some time between my visit and now out of pride. He needs to do this to be part of something himself before he disappears. But something about what she was sayin' bothered me. The way an off-stage noise bothers you. What kind of life is that? Something you hear... He's a guardian of dead men. ...but not clear enough to catch the meaning of. I want him to take it. He has to do it. So you push it aside. [MACHINERY RUMBLING] I guess that's one of your gunmen I've heard about. Sugar Boy, hell, no. He just carry that peashooter for decoration. I tell you one thing, though, ain't nobody can drive like him. [MEN CHATTERING] What do you think, doc? I think it'll do the people of the state some good... and get you some votes. [CHUCKLES] There's a lot of ways to get votes. Cheaper ones. So I understand. Because there are some things I understand. And some things you don't. Just like there's some I don't. What I do know is what makes the mare go. And that you can always make goodness out of badness. That would be two things. Them's the two things I know then. And both of them wrong. No, neither one of 'em, sir, I beg your pardon. You can always make good from bad in all things. In politics, poetry, everything in between. Makes no difference. A man writes a sonnet... and it's good. Is it less good if it turns out the dame he wrote it about is married to someone else? That his passion was illicit? Come on, I wanna show you something. ADAM: I wouldn't mind understanding something, actually. If, as you say, there's only bad to start with from conception on... and that good must be made from bad, then how do you ever know what the good is? [LAUGHS] That's simple. You just make it up as you go along. Make up what? The good. What the hell else we talkin' about? Make it up as you go along? Yeah. Just like folks been doin' for a million years. Since we fall out of trees, crawl out the swamp. They just cook up what is right. If nobody likes that, well, just cook it up again a little different, with a lid on. And you know what? Things under a lid, they don't look no different than things not under a lid, when there's one on it. You don't have to convince me of anything, Mr. Stark. You've already done that. I'm here, aren't I? That's right. And you're a good boy too, doc. A lot better than you think. So goddamn it... ...don't let none of them bastards tell you no different. [TIRES SCREECH] [HORN HONKS] I got a question, since everybody's tryin' to understand everything all of a sudden. Back when we met... at Slade's old place when we shook hands, do you remember that moment? Like it was yesterday. Did you or did you not give me a wink? A wink? Mm-hmm. [♪♪♪] Well, that's just gonna have to remain a mystery. You don't remember. Sure I did. Then...? You know, I... I just do recall givin' you a wink. But then, maybe I got something in my eye, which would make it more of a blink. Did you have something in your eye? What if I didn't? What would that mean? That maybe you figured you and me had something in common the others didn't. Well, I'm not gonna tell you... and deprive you of the mystery. There's just too few honest-to-God mysteries left to go around. WILLIE: And long after I'm dead and gone, and long after these sons of bitches are dead and gone-- I'm talkin' eternity now. --the Willie Stark Hospital will still be standing. Where every man... woman and child who's sick or in pain can go in... knowin' they'll get all a man can do. Not as charity, but as a right! As your right! As it is that every child shall have a complete education! That no person, aged or infirm, shall want or beg for bread! That no poor man's land or house will be taxed! That you shall not be deprived of hope! [APPLAUSE & CHEERING] And if any man... stands between me... and fulfilling your rights, I will strike him down, so help me God! Hip, shin, thigh and neck bone, I will hit him. I will hit him with a meat ax. Somebody give me a meat ax. And bring me another one for my friend and ally. For it's not only God's only son with us on this one. It's the son of the last great leader of this state: Governor Joe Stanton's boy... Dr. Adam Stanton! [CHEERING & APPLAUSE] [♪♪♪] All right. See there? It's not so bad. It's not gonna kill you. [DOOR OPENS] JACK: What's up? [DOOR CLOSES] Sadie. Now he's done it. He's done it again, and I swear this time... Done? Don't act so dumb. Or any dumber than you are. He's two-timin' me again. Or four or one, or whatever timin' you wanna call it, because she's such a smartass. She skate? Shut up. You and your friends. Your highbrow friends. All the money and privilege and everything else you pretend means nothing. To someone with it... it means nothing. [LAUGHS] Don't look so dumb. I said it annoys me. I have no idea what you're talkin' about, or what it was tangled you two up in the first place, love or hate. You know what I'm talkin' about. Maybe you fixed it up. I'm sure you did. Surely he's fixed you up like that pathetic and crazy brother of hers to say thanks. "Thanks, Jack. "She is a looker, I do declare. Mmm-mmm-mmm. "I'm naming you SDP, yes, sir. State Director of Pimps." [♪♪♪] What are you saying? Are you saying...? [♪♪♪] Thank you. Are you s--? [MOUTHS] I love you. We're gonna walk some more. All right. [PHONE RINGING] JACK: Hello. Hello, Mother. Yes, Mother. Yes. [SOFT JAZZ PLAYING OVER RADIO] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. All right, Mother. Goodbye. She and the Peytons and the bridge partner are going to La Grange for a nightcap. Jackie. What? [QUIETLY] I came up here. JACK: This was years ago, you understand. Back when things weren't set in concrete. Back when you had a way of changing the course of things. If you knew how. She was perfect. She had always been perfect. I wanted to keep her that way... and like this. To be young and older... somehow. [LAUGHS] Of course that's not what it looked like to her. When I came home from school at Christmas, we saw each other, of course. We talked about things, but never that. We talked about love in general... like it was the subject of an essay instead of real. She said it was like jumpin' off the high dive... love was. Or like almost gettin' drowned. Which, honestly, I didn't understand... for a long time. You wanna know the reason I stopped that night? It wasn't nobility. That's only what I told myself. We have all the time in the world, right? It was that I knew something was about to be taken from us... leaving in its place... something we didn't know. Which didn't make her sad. But it did me. You only get a couple of moments... that determine your life. Sometimes only one. And then it's gone. Forever. TINY: I talked to Senator Loden this morning. He said you find something nice to put on his plate, he might come around. Vote any way you like. Yeah. Well, you cut yourself a slice. Well, I ain't sayin' that. I know what you're sayin', Tiny. You know, I'd rather bust a man than buy him. Well, that's up to you now. Yeah, sure is. Now go on. Get. [SIGHS] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Do you have any information for me? You sure there's not somethin' you neglected to mention? Somethin' you forgot? Jack. No. Nothin'? Nothin'! Well... How about that, Sugar? Nothin'! Am I alone in this?! The bastards are poundin' at the gate! They're gonna put a vote of impeachment on the calendar! They take that vote today, I'm out! [♪♪♪] I need Judge Irwin with me. Or at least not against me. [SIGHS] So whatever it is... that you don't have on him... use it. [GENTLE OPERA PLAYING] I'm sorry. What did you say? I said I'm going over to the judge's. Well, you mean later. He'll be nappin' this time of day. There isn't any time of day he's gonna wanna hear what I have to tell him. He's not well, you know. I can't help that. I do wish you wouldn't get mixed up in things. It isn't me mixed up in them. The judge is napping right now, Mr. Burden. I'll wait in his study until he comes down. Fire this marble. Watch the chandelier. Okay, you can fire. Hello, Jack. I didn't know you were at your mother's. You just get in? Last night. Yeah. Well, it's a bit early in the day, but, uh, what do you think? A touch of bourbon... never hurt anyone. Least not you and me. We're indestructible, aren't we... you and me? No, thanks. "No, thanks," he says. Begging the question, as the old man pours just one drink, what's on your mind? Out with it. You know who I work for. How could I forget? But let's just sit and pretend that I have. Come sit over here with me. Uh... You know, the truth is, I don't hold the same low opinion of him as many of our friends on the Row. I was almost for him at one time. He was, uh... busting out windowpanes, and, yeah, letting in some fresh air. But now I am worried... about him, you know, knocking down the whole house. So you threw in with his enemies after you said you wouldn't. Oh, Jack. What is politics but a matter of choices? You make a choice knowing there's a chance it's the wrong one. You know that. I mean, you've made a choice, and you know how much it's cost you. There's always a price for everything we do. When we came by that night and were leaving, you said you would think about it. About calling off the dogs? Mm-hmm. No, I did not say that. Your memory is faulty, sir. He said, "Think about it," which I don't have to because I don't have to think about things I already know. You should think it over... even now, because... it's not too late. Hm. Too late for what? Hey, Jack. Jesus. Heh. What is it? Just say you'll back Stark against these attacks. No! [GLASS TINKLING] Now, that has the sound of finality, don't it? Yes, it does. Yeah. [CHUCKLES] You know, I find this, uh... difficult to believe. For me too. And that your boss would even think he could, uh... pressure me, could blackmail me. The first word is better. The first word is prettier, not better. Don't you know that this stuff wouldn't stand up? Not in any court. You-- It happened almost 25 years ago. You couldn't get any testimony... except from that woman who is related, and whose testimony, if she gave it... would be worthless. And everybody else, Jack... ...everybody else is dead. You're not. You're not dead. And you don't live in any court. You live in the world, where people think you're a certain kind of man. I am a certain kind of man. You know, when I was a kid, it seemed natural... that a grown man would stay up nights with catgut and steel wire, pliers and scissors, and make little catapults. Read books about 'em. Will you change your mind? You know, I could hurt you, Jack. Like you're tryin' to hurt me. I could say something. I could tell you something... that would hurt. But I won't. Think it over. I'll be by tomorrow. My mind's made up now. I'll come back tomorrow. [DOOR CLOSES] Made up now. [WOMAN SCREAMS IN DISTANCE] [WOMAN SCREAMS] [DIAL TONE HUMMING] [WOMAN SOBBING] Mother. Mother. Mother. Mama. You! You! You did it! What? You killed him! Who? You killed him. Mother, who? You killed him. Who? You killed him! Who, M--? Who, Mother? You killed him! You killed him! Your father! You killed your father! [SOBBING] [♪♪♪] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [RAIN PATTERING] [IRWIN LAUGHING] MAN: "I am the resurrection and the life," saith the Lord. "He that believeth in me, though he were dead, "yet shall he live. Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die." I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though this body be destroyed, yet shall I see God, and I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. We brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] MINSTER: The city of God, the holy place of the tabernacle of the Most Highest. God is in the midst of her. Therefore, shall she not be removed. [MINSTER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] In every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. CROWD: Amen. [♪♪♪] I told you to scare him, not scare him to death. He wasn't scared. Then why did he do it? Jack? I don't wanna discuss it. Well, let me just say this. I know that he was some kind of friend of the family growing up, all that, so I'm sorry the old bastard shot himself, but we still got MacMurphy and his boys to deal with. And that didn't work out the way we hoped. You need to get someone else for all of it 'cause I'm through. Through with it or with me? JACK: I don't wanna discuss it. [♪♪♪] JACK: After any great trauma or crisis... after the shock subsides, and the nerves stop twitching... you settle down to the new condition of things because you know that all possibility of anymore change has been used up. You've seen the pattern finally 'cause you've stepped back far enough to take in the whole picture. But it's too late now to do anything but accommodate yourself to it. And that's it. There's nothing left to do or say except that God and nothing have a lot in common. [THUNDER RUMBLING] The end. What you don't know is that you're wrong. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh, God, Jack. [PANTING] You've gotta help me. He's crazy. He came to see me, said the most terrible things, and then he walked out. Who? Willie? No, Adam. He said it was my fault. Everything was my fault. Well... Someone called him and told him... ...about me. About you? About you and the governor. You can say it, Anne. It doesn't hurt any more to hear it than to know it. He told him what I'd done, and he said that I'd do anything else to help the governor get what he wanted, even if that meant sacrificing my brother to some kind of fraud. [PIANO PLAYING DELICATE MELODY] ANNE: Which is all the hospital was. Nothing but a scheme to rob the state. And that when the truth came out, and it would, Adam would take the blame. He'd go to prison. For every scheme needs a fall guy, and he's it. JACK: Whoever said that is lying. ANNE: I know. I tried to tell him that's not the way it was. That he was wrong. But he wouldn't listen. He grabbed me and said that he would not be made a fool. That everything else could be filthy and corrupt, but that a man didn't have to be. And then he said that... he wouldn't be a paid pimp to his sister's whore. He said that to me. Well, neither will I. Why'd you do it? You knew what it would do to me. It had nothing to do with you. Then what? I don't know! You better think of something! I wasn't thinking--! Yes, you were! Yes, you were. Was it because of me or in spite of me? I'd never hurt you like that. [TEARFULLY] You would and you have. Oh, God, Jack. You have to help me. I'm afraid Adam's gonna do something to himself. [PIANO STILL PLAYING DELICATE MELODY] [STOPS PLAYING] [♪♪♪] Adam? MAN: Dear God, you are the unseen Lord of this chamber, the silent listener, the judge of our deliberations. Bless the senators you sit among. We place our trust in your guidance. You are our Lord and Savior. Amen. CROWD: Amen. MAN 2: All persons are commanded to keep silent on pain of imprisonment... JACK: Adam! ...while the Senate of the state of Louisiana sits... Adam! ...for the trial of the articles of impeachment against the honorable William Stark, governor of state of Louisiana. I'll go up and make some calls. Anne... [CHUCKLES] ...I'm sure it's gonna be fine. MAN: Mr. Gidré. GIDRE: Nay. MAN: Mr. Honoré. HONORE: Yea. MAN: Mr. Hobbes. HOBBES: Nay. MAN: Mr. Landmark. LANDMARK: Nay. MAN: Mr. Latché. LATCHE: Yea. MAN: Mr. Mouton. MOUTON: Nay. MAN: Mr. Pelerant. PELERANT: Nay. MAN: Mr. Rivette. RIVETTE: Yea. MAN: Mr. Rousseau. ROUSSEAU: Nay. MAN: Mr. Savoir. SAVOIR: Nay. MAN: Mr. Tesh. TESH: Nay. [♪♪♪] MAN: Seventeen yeas, 22 nays. The impeachment of Governor Willie Stark fails. [GAVEL CRACKS] MacMURPHY: There is a line between what is acceptable and what is not. Now, the governor has stepped over that line to guide this vote using means that are inappropriate. Now, I'll call that undue influence. I'll go further, I'll call it coercion. Mr. MacMurphy! Governor! Sir! Governor! Governor! Sir! Sir! You say every word but the one you mean, sir! Go ahead, say it out loud. We're all friends here. But I blackmailed nobody, to be factual! I merely gave you the opportunity to act in accordance with your own nature and like all good men, rise above principle! [LAUGHTER & APPLAUSE] Jack! [♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [FLASHBULBS POPPING] [CROWD SHOUTING CLAMORING] WILLIE: Where's Jack? We did it, boy! We stopped that clock! Ain't gonna be no impeachment today! [♪♪♪] ANNE: Someone called him, Adam. And said that I'd do anything else to help the governor get what he wanted. Even if that meant sacrificing my brother to some kind of fraud. Which is all the hospital was. Nothing but a scheme to rob the state. Adam would take the blame. He'd go to prison. For every scheme needs a fall guy, and he's it. JACK: That's not true. Whoever said that is lying. Hey, doc. Where you been? You been out there swimming? [GUNSHOT] [GROANS] [CROWD SCREAMING] [GUNSHOTS] [♪♪♪] WILLIE: So listen to me. Listen here. And lift your eyes and look on the God's blessed and unflyblown truth: You are a hick! And ain't nobody never helped a hick but a hick hisself. It's up to you to nail these parasites up. Up to you and me and God! Nail up Joe Harrison! ALL: Nail him up! Nail up MacMurphy! ALL: Nail him up! And nail up any bastard that gets between you and the roads and the bridges and the schools and the food you need. You give me the hammer, and I'll do it! [♪♪♪]
