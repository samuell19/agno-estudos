- You put the costumes on the back, huh? - Good. - Marsha. - Ya? The rope is quick to clean, huh? In one hour, here we go. Yes ready. Where do you want to put this on, Din? Ann! Where do you put this? Just there it's okay. - Here, please? - Yes. Good. - Eh! Oops, be careful. - Oops. - If it's spilled, you won't eat! - Sorry, Gizka. Hi, it's set, huh. We open with "Indonesia Raya" first, after that we start with a welcome. - Yes? Thank you. - Yes. -Bu? -Ya? Sorry, ma'am, I haven't received the transcript of the Principal's data. - Alright. I'll send it later, OK? - Yes, thank you, ma'am. Ann! Sini, Ann! - Why? - Ann! Seriously, Ann! Ayla said, I'll be the opening act? Never mind, I'm still freaking out, Ann! - Dear Natha. - Can not! Instead I need you to be an icebreaker! You can! You're confident! Can! - Natha can! - Yes! Get heartburn, Ann! Ouch, I want to go to the toilet! Sis, there are only 30 minutes left to check the sound . Good. Gosh, Thalia. Look at the glasses. Ouch, her brother is so cute. April is not strong. Which one does Thalia want? - Just the long one. - Which one? Cute, like his hair. Gosh! Gosh, Tha, been looking for a new one. - You just broke up this morning. - There he is, Ann. I've been single for half a day. Danger. Ann wouldn't understand that. No time for men, Dude. No time for boys? Let it be. Later, if you like someone, you will get the most feeling. Amin! One two three four! ASBAT, we make tonight the most memorable night for visitors, huh? - And for us! - Yes! That's Batari! Get into position! Hello friends! Hai! That's the performance from the band contest. Ask for applause! Everyone's still passionate, right? - Yes! - Oh, yes. I want to tell. In our school, there is one comic that is very funny. Ann, get scared. Wait, yes. April, Thalia, Gizka, Hana, all Asta Batari, gathered behind the stage. Natha didn't dare go up if she hadn't seen us all. It doesn't take long to wait for a mate, we immediately call. Here comes Natha! - Good afternoon everyone. - Afternoon. Good. My name is Natha. Today, I will tell you about friendship. My best friend is behind it all. Who are we, his name is Asta Batari! Like my topic today, I will talk about friendship. The gang that was in school during high school. I do know kids, I know very well what gang boys face . You, in the jacket. Clear. The son of a motorcycle gang. Yes No? Right? Chills when walking. How about you, the one in green? Well. Your face is very specific. Gang boy. Know what gang? Geng-bel. Now, I want to tell about friendship. When it comes to friendship, we share joy, sorrow together. But my friend ... Power failure! - Ann. - Eh, Ann! Let the technician take care of it! - Yes, Ann! - Ouch, danger! The technician is not there. The show has to keep going. Where did Ann study electricity? Need help? Those who are not interested, are not allowed in the area. - Eh, Ann! - Oops, be careful. If you want to act like an electrician, Make sure you're right if you don't wanna look ridiculous. First, I'm not pretentious. Second, I'm the committee. Who are you and what business backstage? Friends, the lever goes down. - Hati-hati, Ann. - Pelan-pelan, Ann. - Bahaya. - Apa? Ann! - Sudah. Urus panggung. - Baiklah. - Turunkan aku. - Bukankah kau sudah terbiasa? Kita lanjut lagi, ya? Baiklah. Nath! Natha! Tiga! Dah! Terima kasih, Semuanya! Terima kasih! - Kau kru band mana? - Aku bersama band Indie Brothers. Nah, Teman-teman. - Itu dia penampilan dari komika kita. - Dina, Semuanya, kembali ke posisi. Mana tepuk tangannya? Ini dia yang kita tunggu-tunggu. Kita sambut ke panggung, Indie Brothers! Dengan sang vokalis, Geez! Aku pergi dahulu. - Selamat malam, Semuanya! - Malam! Terima kasih sudah mengundang kami. Ayo kita buat malam ini menjadi malam paling berisik! Ini suara kami Suara hati kami Jika kau tak mengerti We do not care Indeed we are different And we are fine If we are together You know you want We have to try it Because we will win no matter what There's no other way. We'll never give up Because we will definitely win Because we won't give up Next performers please be ready. Thank you to all of you. Man, please take care of this. Later, just give it to the vendor. - Yes, Ann. - Thank you. Sorry about that. I didn't know if you were an Indie Brothers kid. It's okay. I like honest comments. Gazza Cahyadi. His nickname is Geez. Unique name. It means "god", huh? How do you know? Because I like reading. Keana Amanda. - Ann. - How do you know? Because I can read? Honestly, my band performance How? Yes, just like that. Earlier when I heard the chorus, the sound was not very audible. But never mind. Really, it's okay. In my opinion, nowadays many bands cannot maintain harmony on stage. So, just noisy, screaming. When finished, they are no longer united. Once again, thank you for being honest. Those are just the words. Wait. My new song. I made it in the studio. The harmony should be more awake than the songs I made on stage. I'm waiting for your opinion. Wait! How can I tell you? We will definitely meet again later. Jeez, what's that? Why are you guys? It's okay. It's anxious to see Ann be able to chat with her guardian angel. You guys are eavesdropping, right? Not eavesdropping. If Ann smiles when chatting with handsome boys, we must be earning. Not just a handsome boy. You're chatting with Geez, Ann! You know, right? One school's top alumni, Ann! Hana, isn't it that Ann wants to date him? - On a date? - Cie! Gosh, your thoughts have gone too far. Be given a song! Tell me more! Thalia! You are the reason, make a wish I will be that person You are the reason Trigger my heartbeat You are the reason my footsteps are advancing Enough to say you want me Because I told you you are for me You are the reason every… - Just got home, Mas? - Eh! - Mbok Ijah. Mama belum pulang, 'kan? - Belum. - Nanti kubelikan piza. - Mantap. - Tapi seperti biasa. - Ya. Terima kasih. Kamu dari mana? Kenapa baru pulang? Biasa, Ma. Les bahasa Jerman dan ke sasana olahraga. Ma, berapa kali aku bilang? Jangan masuk ke kamarku tanpa izin. Kenapa memangnya? Kamu menyembunyikan narkoba, ya? Mama bercanda. Mama tahu kamu tak akan menyia-nyiakan masa depan kamu. Ya. Aku investasi Mama. - Kamu akan senang di Berlin. - Sejak kapan Mama peduli kesenanganku? Kamar kamu berantakan sekali. Di Berlin nanti, tak ada Mbok Ijah. - Kamu bisa membereskan baju sendiri? - Tentu bisa, Ma. Apa lagi ini? Pasti terjatuh waktu aku siapkan untuk disumbangkan kemarin, Ma. Ma. Ingat, Geez. Tak ada musik lagi. Pasar Minggu! Awas! Merapat belakang! Tarik! Pasar Minggu! Geser. Bagaimana? Kau tak seperti psikopat yang menungguku pulang sekolah, 'kan? Kau lebih memilih aku masuk ke kelas? Ulasannya. Sudah didengar CD-nya, 'kan? Sudah. - Tapi… - Kenapa? - Terlalu klise? Bridge standar? Atau… - Aku belum jawab. Tapi hasil karyaku genius, 'kan? - Siapa yang bilang begitu. - Jadi, apa? Lagi pula, kenapa pendapatku sebegitu pentingnya? Kalau untukku tak penting, kenapa aku memberi satu-satunya kopi CD padamu? Jadi, CD seret yang kemarin kau berikan padaku satu-satunya kopianmu? Maaf sekali, Geez. Saat aku putar, suaranya seret dan tersendat begitu. Seret? Tersendat? Apa? Ya, lagunya bagus. Tapi… Tapi? Kurang menempel. Musik rok bukan berarti isinya sembarangan berisik, Geez. Mungkin ada yang salah dengan telingamu. Apakah kalian sadar? Ini sudah seminggu semenjak Ann diajak berkenalan dengan Geez. Bagaimana? Sudah ada kabar lagi atau belum dari dia? Kalian menghitung? Bagaimana bisa tak menghitung? Kami mau merayakan pelepasan status jomlomu! Aku saja sudah melupakan dia. Astaga, untuk apa diingat? Aku tahu! Aku mau melihat Geez di Instagram. Dia punya pacar atau tidak. Ya, 'kan? - Aku tak peduli. - Yah! Ann, maaf sekali, Ann. Dibuat privat, Ann. Aku tak bisa melihatnya. - Mohon maaf, ya! - Busku datang. Pergi dahulu, ya? Dah. - He's handsome, Ann! - Just follow, Ann! If not, I'll just follow! Pull! Come on, hang up, Bang! - Geez? - I want to show you my record. Right now? Ann. - Listen up. - What? Next door. You My morning sun You Rays in my day You shine my sun You are everything to me You are my sunshine. You are my everything Your smile Make me pound Pull! How? Memorable ? "Memorable"? You mean it's stuck? Yes, that is what I mean. Nine out of ten. Uh, you know what? Thirty-two recordings. If you don't like it too, means I have to change bands. - Thirty-two? - I want thirty-three. But my bass player had to go back to the hospital. - He's got typhus. - Wait. So, you pulled your bass player from the hospital just to record this song? Yes. After recording, take turns. My typhus drummer. Kidding. Your humor is weird. Thanks, yes, Geez. Want to come in? If I feel at home, how? Just hold on. For you. iPod. In the past, I also had, but it's been sold. Thanks, yes, Geez. I'm waiting for your other works. OK, I'm in, OK? Want to do assignments. Sure? Sure you are more willing to pay attention to assignments instead of paying attention to me? Sure. I like. I like women who are more concerned with value. Let me attach importance to him. Dah. - Asalamualaikum. - Wa alaikum salam. Kenapa Ibu ada di sini? Siapa tadi, Ann? Apa yang dia berikan kepadamu? Oh, alumni, Bu. Namanya Geez. Ini. Tiba-tiba memberikan iPod? - Sebentar. Kamu dan dia tidak… - Ih! Tidak, Ibu! Tidak dekat. Cuma teman. Aman. Dia alumni. Tak dekat dan cuma teman, sudah memberikan iPod? Anggap saja rezekinya anak teladan yang rajin belajar. dan akan lulus dengan nilai sempurna seperti doa ibunya tercinta. Hati-hati, Ann. Benar, ya? Ya, Ibu. Aku sayang Ibu. - Ibu! - Ya? Ini bunga dari siapa? Tadi ada yang mengirimkannya untukmu. Ann, kalau kamu terima bunga ini, berarti aku tak sempat masuk. Semoga bisa untuk menemani saat mendengar laguku. Dari laki-laki tadi, Ann? Is it just a friend? I studied first, yes, Mother! Ma, everything all right? Congratulations, honey. You are accepted. You are accepted. NIEDERSACHSEN UNIVERSITY Don't embarrass Mama as an alumni. Mama already called Mama's friend in Berlin to arrange for your move. Ma, how about I just take the SNMPTN exam results? - College here? - What? You said the exam was just for fun. From the start, we agreed that you would enter Mama's campus. You know? It has been years Mama sacrifice time, cost ... Ma, I did. Mama, take it easy, okay? I will definitely go to Berlin, Ma. Yes? Geez. You are lucky. All of Mama's dreams for you come true. If in the past someone guided Mama like Mama guided you now, surely Mama doesn't have to go through so many disappointments like now. We'll arrange a dinner to celebrate this, shall we? Thank you, Ma. Geez. Have you got the flowers? Already. My brother accepted. But he stripped it down. Looks like for college assignments. He stripped it? Kidding. Thanks, yes, Geez. You're weird too. Today, I still read Five Friends . My friends too. Everyone said I was old-fashioned from reading the Five Friends . If your friends think you are weird, are you sure they are suitable to be your friend? It so happens that my friends think I'm old - fashioned, not weird. Ancient is like vintage . Forgive me. Uh, what are you doing? As an apology, I bought it. No need. I can buy it myself. ENGLISH LANGUAGE GERMAN You want to go to Germany, right? My mom is a graduate there. So, he speaks German. Shall we drink coffee? I don't drink coffee. Besides, I already have an appointment. With a boy? I'll take you, okay? Sister Ann is coming! Halo! Have you memorized the song that Kak Ann taught yesterday ? Already! Oh, yes. Today, Kak Ann brought a friend. His name is Brother Geez. Hai, Kak Geez! So, later Geez will sing with us in large numbers, huh? We start. One two Three. When the Saints go marching in When the Saints go marching in Oh, I want to be in the number When the Saints go marching in - I did! - Patience, Mas! - Down! - Eh! ICE CREAM Semuanya jawab pakai bahasa Inggris juga, ya? Jangan takut salah. So, what is your favorite animal? - Saya! - Saya! Neng Ann! Kata Geez, boleh ambil es krim sebanyak-banyaknya. Pelan-pelan. Satu-satu, ya? Jangan berebut. Satu-satu saja. - Satu-satu! - Tiga! Harus beli satu gerobak? Mau dua? Tapi nanti anak-anak batuk. - Kamu berlebihan. - Satu. Terima kasih, Om. Kesukaanmu. Matcha. Terima kasih. Setiap Minggu, kamu mengajar di sini? Jadi, anak di sini agak kurang mampu untuk membayar les bahasa Inggris. Jadi, siapa tahu dengan aku membantu mereka dengan cara seperti ini, nanti mereka tak salah bersaing dengan teman-temannya saat SMA. Kenapa? - Hah? - Maaf, Mas. Tadi uangnya kurang. - Saya salah hitung. - Ah, Mas! Bagaimana? Terima kasih, ya, Geez. Mau masuk? - Mau minum atau yang lain? - Tidak. - Lantas, maunya apa? - Maunya kamu jangan masuk dahulu. Ini berapa lama? Sudah malam. Aku mau mengerjakan tugas. Ann. Sampai bertemu lagi, Peri Kecil. Ann. - Asalamualaikum! - Halo, Ann! - Astaga! - Sudah! - Ayo, duduk! - Duduk! Eh, sedang apa? Kenapa tiba-tiba ke sini? Astaga, waktunya bercerita! Jadi, ceritanya, satu jam yang lalu, kami sedang kongkow di… - Gizka. - Aku. Lalu tiba-tiba ada suara bel. Ya sudah, saat kami buka pintunya, kami dapat kiriman bubble tea sebanyak ini, Ann! Dari siapa, Kawan-Kawan? Geez! Astaga, Geez! Dia memang sungguh mengerti, saat mendekati perempuan, harus mendekati teman-temannya dahulu. Dari usahanya itu, kami semua sudah cukup yakin untuk memberikan restu kepada kalian berdua. Jadi, harga kalian semua cuma segelas bubble tea. - Lumayan, gratis. - Bukan begitu juga, Ann. Ya, tidak. Ini baru pembukaan. Dia berjanji akan menyuplai bubble tea selama satu minggu untuk kami semua. Coba bayangkan, selama satu minggu. Tapi dengan syarat kami membantumu bersiap-siap untuk pergi. Memang kita mau ke mana? Kami tak ke mana-mana. Yang pergi hanya kau! Kalau begini, Ayah tak ada apa-apanya. Kalau Ayah jago, sudah jadi musikus. Bukan fotografernya. Kalau yang ini, suka? Kamu bisa memainkan blues juga? Mas. Geez, bisa pulang sebelum pukul 21.00, 'kan? Sekarang saja belum berangkat. - Belum macetnya. - Mas. Maaf, Bung. Om sudah coba bantu kamu. Saya usahakan pulang sebelum pukul 21.00, Tante. Ini baru anak band yang sopan. Kau enak. Rambutmu bagus, kau punya alis. Aku? - Aku ada apa? - Aduh, Ann! Ann, kau punya banyak sekali kelebihan. Jadi, kau juga pantas berkencan. Ya 'kan? - Bagaimana? - Jadi? - Ya, Ann. - Bisa, 'kan? - Ayo, Ann. - Mau, ya? - Ya sudah. - Bagus, Ann! - Ya! - Mau? - Tapi! - Apa? Kalau kalian mau mendandaniku, jangan aneh-aneh, ya? - Aku ingin tetap jadi diri sendiri. - Beres. Siap. - Tenang saja! - Ayo! Geez, kalau ini, pasti kau tak tahu lagunya. Astaga, Mas. Tak usah sok. Ann, Mas belum memainkan apa-apa. Tapi Ann tahu Mas cuma bisa satu lagu. Baru mau pamer. Hai. Geez, kamu sudah tahu mau kuliah di mana? Coba ujian masuk negeri juga? Geez, Tante Manda ini, kalau urusan akademis, itu jatahnya dia. - Saya diterima di FEUI, Tante. - Ya, prinsipnya, kita sungguh berharap konsentrasi Ann tidak terganggu. In order to get good grades, you can enter a state university, huh? Ya, Tante. Yes, ma'am. Mas, dad. We left first, huh? - Aunt, Om. - Yes. But. - Don't forget, huh? At 21.00. - Yes, Aunt. Great, Ann! Great! - Enjoy the trip! - Ann, take care, okay? - Mission accomplished! - Hooray! I've never been here. Therefore, I chose this place, Why do you know I've never been here? If so, the photo must be on Instagram. Are you stalking me? Your account is not made private. So that anyone can see, right? Come on. Thank you. - Geez. - Ya? But promise, yeah, this is the last surprise? Because I'm not the type to be surprised. Lagi pula, kalau aku tahu hari ini kau mau mengajakku pergi, - aku bisa mengerjakan tugas dahulu. - Sut. Kamu sebawel ini, ya, kalau sedang gugup? Siapa yang gugup? Pertama kali berkencan dengan laki-laki? Kata siapa? Di sini, restorannya bagus. Tapi kenapa menunya banyak yang dicoret? Makanannya ada, tapi tadi aku sudah minta yang mengandung boga bahari atau kacang dicoret. Alergi, 'kan? Jangan bilang sebentar lagi kamu akan tahu golongan darahku apa. - O. - Ih! Sepertinya aku harus takut padamu. Permisi. Silakan, Mbak. - Sudah selesai? - Sudah, Mbak. Biar saya ambil, ya? - Terima kasih, Mbak. - Ya. - Terima kasih, Mbak. - Ya. Ulasannya? Sembilan dari sepuluh. Tapi bisa jadi sepuluh. Kalau kamu mau ikut denganku. Ke mana? Kejutan, Dewa Kejutan. Awas hujan. - Pak Amir. - Ya? - Pak Amir! - Siapa, ya? Eh, Neng Ann! Sebentar, pintunya saya buka dahulu. Mau menunjukkan ke teman saya sebentar. Oh, ya. Ayo masuk. Silakan. - Hujan. Ayo, cepat. - Ya. - Saya hidupkan lampunya dahulu. - Ya, Pak. Yuk. Wah, ini tanahnya punya siapa? Punya keluarga besar, tapi ayahku yang mengurusnya. Nah, yuk. Sekarang, aku tahu kenapa kau tak takut naik steger. - Lama. - Ya, sebentar. Awas, hati-hati. Wah. Keren sekali tempat ini, Ya. Eh! Aman pula. Ada ukulele. Boleh juga. - Sini. - Baiklah. Ulasannya? Sebelas. - Dari? - Sepuluh. Aku cuma bisa memainkan lagu ini kalau dengan ukulele. Kenapa kau pergi? Why do you live on my own? When I need it Need you here Is this my fault? Or is it what you want? Don't wanna see you again But also want you back I don't know everything I think The wounds that will remain in my heart Where are you? Where are you? Do not care Where are you? Where are you? I myself Forgive me. The song is not fun. What's the song about? When my mom and dad were together and when they parted ways. More precisely, when my father left me and my mother. And how my mother could not forget her hatred. Tonight… maybe my closest night to feel the name of the family - Geez. - Ya? So, my father had a minor heart attack two years ago. My mother is a lecturer. Now, Mother is the backbone of the family. Therefore, I must be able to pass into the public medical faculty. Because I don't have the heart. Can you ask me to help pay for me to enter private medical school? Why are you laughing? Not. I thought of you telling your patient's condition in a sadistic style you give a review. Halo, Ma? Yes, again at the bookstore. But ready to go home. Yes. Why are you lying? Ann, it's complicated explaining it. It's about 21.00. You promised to send me home before then, right? Or do you want to lie to my parents too? Ann. That's not what I mean, Ann. Ann. Why? If you can lie to your own parents, how about the others? Ann. Okay, I lied. It's because my mom wanted me to be focused and ready to go to business school in Berlin. Are you going to Berlin? Ann. You want me to be honest? I've been accepted. Next month, I'm leaving for Berlin. Ann. Ann. Either way it hurts more. Do not know or find out. I don't know which is more sad. Listen to the truth or live a pleasant lie . If only the foundations could be honest and trusting, we know the word disappointed will not come to greet. TYPE - Halo, Geez. - Ya, Ma. Tomorrow, Mama comes home. You can pick up Mama, please. This is good news. Mama is very happy. This latest project, Mama sure will succeed. Ma. I have a lover. And I want to be serious. He knows you're going to Berlin? Tofu. Have you told what companies will invest in this project? I'll tell you in the car later, okay? - No! Graduate! - Steady! I never thought I would pass! - The important thing is to pass! - Yes, pass! If you want to kick him out, I'm going now. It's good to ask people out, then just walk away. Quiet. Hai. Congratulations, yes. I've talked to my mom about us. He agreed. I won't lie again, Ann. We do not hide? My time here won't be long, Ann. But I promise, I will always be there at the most important moment in your life. Especially your birthday and graduation later. Four years in Berlin. That's also if you go to college properly. Every vacation, I return to Jakarta. You will never celebrate anything by yourself, Ann. Geez, you don't make promises you can't keep. Furthermore, indeed you have checked the 2016 government's version of the national holiday schedule ? So, Little Fairy, would you like to accept this symbolic flower of holiness? Congratulations, yes. Thank you. - You don't have to go to the campus yard. - Why? It's not good if my senior caught me being escorted by ... Girlfriend? Stop! That. Dah, Ann. Dah. Come on! Run! - Come on, run! - Hurry! What time is it already? Come on, quickly! It's still morning. This is a rude example. Given the task, not done. Anything else that is rude? Hey, you! Where is your ID? Come on, over here! Stand up! This is more rude! Like Five Friends too, huh? Yes. Very nice. - Ann. - Tari. Wait, yes, Ann. Ma. Why is Mama here? Who made this event, all of Mama's friends. German graduates. Ann! Ma, introduce, this is Ann. Good afternoon, Auntie. Good Morning. How are you? Geez, this is your mother? - Yes, Om. - Very beautiful. Geez must have learned music from Mom too, right? No wonder, Geez. You have great taste in music. Now, we know where it came from. Hello, Aunt. Sorry, yes, my husband and child really like to joke. Hello, I am Manda, Ann's mother. Geez, Mama has to go. You delivered, huh? Mom wait below. Now. Excuse me, everyone. Nice to meet you and your family. Good day. Dad, that's right, " Guten tag ." - Good day? - Yeah. - Om, Aunt. - Yes? Sorry, yes. I said goodbye first. I just hold the glass There. Ma! Why is Mama being rude to Ann's family? That ridiculous family? Ma, I told Mama. I have a girlfriend. There he is. Ann and her family, Ma. The bunch is close, you think you can waste your time with them? Yes, what's wrong with it, Ma? Because they are losers. Ma! Mama don't know! Just from the clothes, Mama could see their quality. Try, what is the job of the father? Was a photographer. Was a photographer, now? Why Mama… As long as you know, Om Sentot had a heart attack, Ma. Since then, he hasn't been able to take much time to take pictures. In other words, unemployment, right? Geez, are you aware? If you want to be an artist, be an idealist, what are the edges? So poor! Trouble family, trouble everyone. Mama doesn't want you to be around people like that. Mama wants you to be successful and successful, have an international career. Yes? So, Mama wants you to be among successful people. Not just hanging around, ungrateful. Next week, you go to Berlin. Dear. You have your papa's blood. If we let our guard down just a little, you can be like him. We don't want that to happen. Mama doesn't want that to happen. Mama has arranged everything. You just show up. Later, Mama's friend whose name is Astrid will pick you up and will take you to the dorm, huh? Yes, I went in first, Ma. Dah, Ma. - Happy Birthday! - Happy Birthday! - Happy Birthday! - Happy Birthday! - Happy Birthday! - Happy Birthday! - Happy birthday, dear Ann. - Happy birthday, dear Ann Make an application! -Hore! -Hore! Cut the cake! I asked, "Are you serious?" - Wash your hands before eating. - Spray this. Friends, I'm a little unwell. I'll go to the toilet for a bit, okay? - What happened to you? - Want some company? - Are you okay, Ann? - It is okay. Geez. The best ones usually appear late, right? Happy birthday? Gosh, it's getting harder and harder for me to have a boyfriend if the correct male standard is like Geez! I'll give you later! Come on, just come along. Keep walking. - Slowly. - Yes. - Hold. - Where is this? - Come on. - Where? Back to the body. Sit down. Now, open it. Surprise! I think… I brought your favorite place here. So, when I leave later, I will always imagine beach breeze ... the waves… and sunshine on your face, Ann. Gazza Cahyadi! Do not go anywhere. Geez! Ma… Come here. After all that Mama gave you, it turns out that this is the payback. You are indeed your papa's son! You said you wanted to go to Berlin, but did you come here? What for? If Mama's friends find out you didn't get there, they will panic and report to the police, thinking you have been hit by a disaster. Turns out, you came here instead? Do what? Dating? Listen, yes. Don't take my child to the level of you who only likes to be seduced by boys! Ma! It's all my fault, Ma. Ann has nothing to do with it. Because of that woman, you betrayed your mom? The ones who fall and wake up alone raise you, so a single parent? Just him? Mama thinks you're the only person who won't betray Mama. What turns out? Embarrassing! Hey, congrats, yeah. You have destroyed my family! Ma! This is all my fault! Ann has nothing to do with it! Ann doesn't know anything, Ma! Ma, I beg of Mama. Please. Wait in the car, Ma. Uneasy, we are noticed. - You come with Mama now! - Mom, I'm definitely going to Berlin! Mama please escort me there, but I asked Mama for help. Give me some time, Ma. Just five minutes. Please, Mom. Ann, aku bisa jelaskan semuanya. Jadi, ini kado dari kamu, Geez? Saat kamu sudah janji padaku kamu tak akan berbohong lagi? Ann, aku juga sudah janji padamu untuk ada di ulang tahun kamu. Ya, 'kan? Jangan bilang kamu melakukan ini semua demi aku! Ann, kumohon. Mama kamu sudah menunggu. Silakan marah padaku, Ann. Puaskan saja. Luapkan semua kekesalan kamu. Tapi kalau besok aku berangkat, kumohon jangan benci aku, Ann. Kita memang akan berpisah, tapi tak seperti ini, Ann. Aku tak akan sanggup. Ann. Sepertinya mau hujan, Ann. - Haltenya masih jauh pula. - Ann! Ann! Ya. Aku Rifky. Aku periskop Geez selama dia di Berlin. Kau butuh antar dan jemput? Ayo. Tepat sekali, Ann. Aku ikut, ya? Rif, aku sepertinya masih bisa naik kendaraan umum. - Thank you. - Ann, really… You do it all yourself You can not be advised Says my song is ugly But you are still My little fairy You are funny when I disturb you I climbed the tree house. Value ten out of ten But Mama told me to go home at 8:00 p.m. But you are still My little fairy My little fairy You are my Little Fairy Ann, there's a package. From Geez again, huh? When you gather, "Tang, are you not ashamed of your sister?" "Swim to high." Jeez. "Swim to high?" What? Jellyfish swim every day. Where is it? Not tall, but mushy. Noisy. Now, let's discuss ... Don't be annoying, I'm pissed off. We discussed sensitive matters for some other people. LDR. - LDR is an abbreviation. right? - What is that? Lu He Cracked. Yes, because it will not happen. Long shots rarely work. Moreover, long distance relationship? Because ... Even the research data from BKMG, 85 percent of people with LDR fail. - Fifteen percent didn't work. - The same! Yes, because it is very difficult. That is, you are free to send messages every day, "Don't forget to eat, honey." But if he is fed there by another couple? I used to have a girlfriend in Kalimantan. Now an ex. I've caught him cheating. I immediately asked there. "Honey, you said unfortunately only to me?" "Ya, tapi…" Try page 156, Tar. Oh, that was that, right? GOOD LUCK - For who? - For you. From Geez. This is funny. It seems like over time people will think of your boyfriend if for example it's not Rifky yesterday or him, not Geez. Geez alone is still not clear whether my boyfriend or not. Thank you very much. But I asked you to please tell Geez, don't send you guys again. If you need food delivery services, flowers, or anything else, there is an application. I just want to say, Geez is currently hard to reach. Hard to call, huh? But can you communicate with you? Just date the three of them. Ann? Why? Tar… Why? Ann! This is the second attack in the last year. The blockage is quite alarming and need immediate action before other complications. We will observe again in the first year. Apa pun untuk menyembuhkan suami saya, Dok. Baiklah. Ini semua perhiasan yang Ibu kumpulkan selama ini. Tanah yang dekat Bogor bagaimana, Bu? Yang ada rumah pohonnya. Itu punya keluarga, Gi. Ibu harus minta izin keluarga besar. Ibu tak tahu saat ini nilainya berapa, tapi kalau untuk biaya operasi, rasanya pasti cukup. Ann. Nanti habis dari swalayan, mampir ke rumah, ya. Tolong ambilkan baju ganti Ibu. - Ya, Bu. Asalamualaikum. - Wa alaikum salam. Hati-hati. Halo! - Halo! - Aku juga. Begini, Ann. Jadi, ceritanya baru saja kami dihubungi oleh Mas Barista Ganteng. Katanya, kau ada masalah! Kau baik-baik saja? Bukan barista, tapi pemilik. Ya, intinya itu. Tapi aku senang kami tetap menjadi kontak daruratmu setelah sekian tahun! Terima kasih, Ann! Kau memang selalu diselamatkan laki-laki ganteng. - Resepnya apa? - Berbagilah. Sudah sadar? Ini, diminum dahulu selagi masih panas. - Pelan-pelan. - Ya. Terima kasih, Mas. Ini gratis, Mas? Ya, gratis. Untuk kami, gratis juga, 'kan? Untukmu bukan gratis, tapi hibah! Ann! Katanya, kau sedang mencari pekerjaan sampingan lagi, 'kan? Ini, di sini ada. Mumpung sudah kenal dengan yang punya. Ya, kami memang butuh karyawan lebih, tapi yakin bisa langsung bekerja? Berjalan saja tadi hampir tertabrak. Bagaimana kalau menghadapi pelanggan yang rewel? Saya bisa, Mas. Saya janji akan bekerja dengan baik. When it comes to work, Ann is really a hard worker. - We're all witnesses. Yes, right? - Correct. Anyway, if Ann works a mess, - We're ready to put on our bodies. - Yes. Correct. We guarantee, Mas. Let's just say the vacancies are filled. - Good. - Thank you sir! Thank you, yes, Mas! Ouch! Quiet. - Hello? - Hi. I'm busy doing internship lately. So, I didn't have time to contact you. I am really, really sorry. From earlier, what you've been talking about is just about you and you only. How about me? Yes, I was just about to ask, Ann. How about you? How about Om Sentot? Good. Dad is nice too. Geez, I don't have long. My birthday is soon. Are you sure you want to come? I must have come for my Little Fairy. Is it a promise or something? Ann, I won't make promises I can't keep. I will prove it to you. OK, I'll call you later, OK? Ann, why aren't you home yet? Why is your expression in such a problem? - It's okay, ma'am. - Enthusiasm, huh? - Good night. - Night, Mas. Thank you. This is the order and this is for Mas. - I didn't order this, Ma'am. - It's okay, Mas. Just have a drink. Thank you. Ma? Ann, I was just about to leave, but my mom came. He's suddenly here until next week. Sorry, Ann. I can't come on your birthday. But I promise I'll fix this all. Ann? This can't be about your father, right? If so, then you must have asked permission to come home to me. This is about Geez, Mas. Geez? Two years I know him. He's the first person who made me feel happy, as happy as I am. But he's also the one who makes me feel so sad. In fact, I already told him Don't give me a promise if it can't be kept. Whatever is heavy, will definitely pass. Whatever is fun, will definitely disappear. Most important, we must always learn from whatever we receive today. Because the universe has its own plans. So whatever you feel from Geez today, if bad, forget later too. If it's good, don't throw it away. Follow your heart, Ann. Geez. Please don't position you have to choose between your mother and me. I'm tired. The distance between us carries more negativity. I give up on this uncertainty, Geez. I can't stand a one-sided love . If you care for me, you will accept my decision So, I beg you to stop your periscope. Don't contact me again, whether directly or indirectly. Help me to forget you, Geez. Because you are far away, not only physically, but also heart. And all this time, I was lulled by you. Starting today, Your Little Fairy's wings are broken. - Knowledgeably! - Here, there's something special about me. Awesome! Cookies with my original recipe! - Look, it says " Best Friend ." - This is Asta Batari, right? Well, starting tomorrow, I can't treat you as my employee anymore? Thanks, yes, Ann. Because you helped me build this cafe. I don't know what kind of memento suits you. This is yellow cattura coffee . Hope you like. Mas Bayu. Just give me coffee beans? Not another seed? Gold ore. Whose gold? Mas Bayu you mean? Are you kidding? Mas, this souvenir is very special. - Thank you very much. - You are welcome. Oh, yes. Tomorrow I graduated, Mas. Congratulations, yes. - Friends, go first, huh? - Yes? - Dah, Mas. - Be careful, Mas. - Ouch! - Sit! - Honestly, it's delicious, Ann. - Thank you. Ann, are you serious you didn't catch the code, Mas Bayu? Unseen period? Just now the way to look at him is very different. There is no working relationship. So, you can. Already, it's better now we toast first. - Good. - Ouch! For our future! - For our future! - Future! What are you doing here? Where is my guitar? You answered Mama's question first. What are you doing in Jakarta? As Mama asked. I've been to college. Until this semester, my grades have always been perfect. I take the holidays for seminars. Take an internship. - Tapi kamu belum lulus. - Aku sudah mengajukan tesisku, Ma. Sisanya adalah formalitas. Mama tahu itu. Ma, aku sudah menjalankan tugasku. Sekarang, sekali lagi aku tanya. Di mana gitarku? Lalu kamu mau jadi apa? Mau jadi musikus? - Mau jadi artis seperti… - Papa? Aku suka musik seperti Papa. Mukaku seperti Papa. Caraku tidur seperti Papa. Apa karena itu Mama melampiaskan semua kebencian Mama ke Papa lewat aku? Ma, di darahku, mengalir darah Mama. Kalau aku gugup, mataku banyak berkedip seperti Mama. Aku berkuliah di tempat Mama. Aku menjalankan semua rencana Mama. Aku tahu apa pun yang aku lakukan tak bisa mengubah kenyataan bahwa aku anak Papa. Tapi yang tak aku sangka, ternyata semua yang sudah aku lakukan selama ini tak bisa juga membuat Mama menerima kenyataan bahwa aku juga anak Mama! Aku banyak salah pada Mama, tapi jangan benci aku karena kesalahan orang lain, Ma. Mama tanya ke aku kenapa aku pulang. Besok, Ann wisuda, Ma. Tapi hari ini… Hari ini, Mama berulang tahun. Ini kado untuk Mama. Aku minta sesuatu dari Mama. Ma, lihat aku. Ma, lihat aku. Aku sebagai Geez, Gazza Cahyadi. Bukan sebagai bayang-bayang Papa. Aku tepati janjiku kepada Mama. Aku tak lari dari tanggung jawab. Aku Geez! Ma. Kenapa gitar itu penting untukku? Aku ingat. Dahulu, waktu aku bermain gitar, walaupun kacau sekali, itu adalah terakhir kalinya aku melihat Mama tersenyum. Mama tak bermaksud membuat kamu merasa seperti itu, Geez. Maybe Papa ran away too because of Mama's hard heart. Mom, Papa left because he's a loser and irresponsible boy. It's not Mama's fault. Mama told me herself. I have to be around successful people. Geez doesn't have to go far, Ma. Mom's son. Let's welcome our best graduate, Keana Amanda. There are some things that the more approachable, the farther away. That which is maintained, is getting messy. The more it is built, the more it collapses. Because plans are designed not just to be realized, but also for adulthood. Being a doctor was my dream from childhood. Over time, dreams turn into ideals. Ideals turn into targets. But the target turned into a worry. Sometimes… we think more about the bad possibilities that will happen in the future and neglect today which really happened. Until the end, the universe said, "Have been given the opportunity, but how come you don't know how lucky?" But I don't want to be that kind of person. Hence, today, I want to thank you ... to my family… my friends… and a special person to me. The one who always taught me to be on the straight path. People who always encourage to be confident. But I've never said this before. Thank you, Bayu. Because you've made me the best version of myself. Wa salamualaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh. - There it is. - Good. - Even farther. - It's far. One two… - Repeat. The skinny one. - Ann. Can I talk to you alone? - Further. - Yes, all in order. - Ann! - Ann? - Mas Bayu? - Eh! Maybe now you want to be given green bean seeds! - I gave you coffee beans yesterday! - Carelessly. What's the matter, Mas? I want to say ... Thank you for saying my name when I graduated. Mas Bayu lama! Ann, Mas Bayu wants to shoot you! Hurry! Accepted or not? Yes, right? If rejected, there is always a reserve player, Mas. - Ih! - Thalia! What? Bayu doesn't want to do anything. Want to cry. Ann, I'm waiting for the perfect time to give this to you. And I think ... this is the right moment for me to give this to you. Ann, I want to be your best man and your guide. If you are not ready, I will wait for you. Wa alaikum salam. Little Fairy. For four years I felt I was the most sinful of all. Can't keep my promise. I accept the consequences, follow your wishes. Stop calling you at all. Even though I've let you down, at least I have the determination to carry out your wishes even though it hurts. And today, I saw it at graduation. You have become an adult woman. Ann, I did not call you, but not a day i stop thinking about you Give me a chance to explain to you in person, Ann. In front of your house, I have prepared a car to take you. FIVE CLOUDS Geez. Twenty-one books of the original version of Five Four . It took me two years to search all of that in Europe, Ann. Geez, you remember everything. You never really left. Don't cry, Ann. If you dare to cry, I will close all ice cream shops in the world. Geez. I am in front of you. But why only now? Why are you coming home only now? Because I'm looking after, Ann. And I keep one promise of mine, Ann. If I can't come home for your birthday, at least I can still go home when you graduate. But why today? When I gave my heart and promise to Bayu. I wish you had arrived earlier, Geez. I can't just break my promise ! Like you. You have kept your promise. - Especially if we do not keep our promises? - Ann. My little fairy. Look me in the eye and say that you don't love me. As, Ann. Ann! We never know how the universe works. What, how, why. All the question sentences that are now become heartbreaking reality. Regret and annoyed together. Being a solution that will never end until he gave me an explanation on a return.
