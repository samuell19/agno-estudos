* Father * Listen to me * I'm a lot like you * I must live my life and live it true * Like you said you have to do * Mother * Listen to me * There's so much to tell * It's important that you listen well * When the pain... Put me down, you idiots! Go, Tomanski! I'm almost there... Hey! Hey, Tomanski! You don't take no crap from no rich kids, huh! Monica, bring home a diploma, or bring home a husband. The richer the better. But don't get pregnant. Have a little more faith in me than that, Aunt Lorraine. I'm not you. Go, Tomanski! I'll miss you, Monica. Oh, I love you, sweetheart. - You be careful, okay? - Okay. - Who's your buddy? - You. Yeah. Who's your buddy? * Knowing love is all * I am in you * And you are in me * Through each other's eyes * We see * Listen to me * Hold me * I will hold you * Listen to me while I speak my heart * You can talk to me * We're all looking for a place to start * Where we tell the truth again * Tell the truth again * Love me * Listen to me, life is not that long * And we don't have time to get it wrong * Let's believe and let's begin * Let's begin * Won't you listen to me * For we know how we fall Come on, Tucker.

Thanks a lot, buddy. Excuse me, can you tell me where the administration building... Yeah, it's over by the ice hockey rink over there. - Ice... Thanks! - Yeah, no problem. Excuse me, uh... Pardon me. Could you tell me where the ice hockey rink is? Yeah, it's over by the pool hall. Hey, thanks. Excuse me, could you tell me where the pool hall is? No, but maybe I can recommend a nice clothing store? - Nathan, you're mean. - Look at his hat! It's not that bad. He's probably from the south. Well, I don't know. Look at his haircut. Hey, surfer man! I'll see you in the dorm. - Gar! - Hi, Gar! How you doin'? Hey, hey Christine. I don't suppose any of you would tell me where the administration building is. - Yo! Master debaters. - That's what I thought. Number one. - The inscrutable Mr. Chin. How was your summer? It was all right. How was yours? Great. Just great. Come on, guys. Help him with his things. - Hey, girls. - Hi! How was your summer? We have to talk about our summers. How about some extra gravy with those mashed potatoes? Can I have some carrots, too? I'm starving. Anything your heart desires, just ask. - I'm the man. - I'll remember that. There you go. Well, boy, looks like you could use all the fuel you can get. Hey, man. Thanks. Better stop giving away the extra helpings. The cook's got his eye on you. - Oh, thanks. - Here, help me with this. - Right. Okay. - Oh. - There we go. Tucker Muldowney, Watonga, Oklahoma. - Monica, Chicago. - Hi. Watonga? Yeah, well, the reason you haven't heard of it is 'cause I haven't made it famous yet. - I think you're serious. - I am. See, I'm here on a debate scholarship, and they only give out two a year, you know? - Really? - No talking in the ranks. Dishwasher duty. Move it. How may I help you? Not too many people know this, but 88 % of our congressmen and senators were all in their college debate teams. You want to go into politics? Well, actually, it's my intention to become the President of the United States one day. But I don't tell too many people about that. Of course not. - So you here on scholarship, too? - You got it. - What for? - Debate. You're Tomanski? You're supposed to be brilliant. Look, uh, I'm sorry about... I feel really stupid. Hey, boss! My name's Tucker. Nice guy. It's gonna be fun. Who's that? Who's he? Oh, boy, uh... Um, I'm your roommate, but I can leave and come back later. No, it's cool. Come on in. Come on, Gar. I was almost there. What's one last orgasm in your life on me? Next to the threat of war in the Middle East, how much does that really matter? Well, can't we go back to my room and finish? You have to finish by yourself. I have to meet my new roommate. Hey, uh, Gar... How about I get Tasha and come back? - Goodbye, Mia. - Tasha? Bye. That, uh... That going all the time? Welcome to Kenmont. Tucker Muldowney. Pleased to meet you. - Garson McKellar. - Hi. How do you possibly find time to study in this place? Coach Nichols says you're terrific. I've been trying to figure out if he set us up as roommates for your sake or mine. Are you kidding? You're the best. You know, I have studied all your big debates on video. And for a long time, I copied your style right down to a gnat's ass. What kind of style do you have now? Well, I'm kind of working on my own thing. It's lots of home-spun candor, my best Southern drawl, but it's still a long, long way from your league, believe me. Oh, is that what you mean by "home-spun candor"? To me, it sounded like good old false modesty. You came here to knock me off my pedestal, didn't you, country boy? All right. All right. If at UCLA or Notre-Dame the hero of the hour is the football coach, our hero is a man most of you know simply as Charlie. I give you the winningest debater in collegiate history, the man who has coached Kenmont to seven conference titles in 12 years, Professor Charlie Nichols. Whoa! Coming through. Excuse me. Sorry. Hi. Sorry, I'm late. Atilla made me stay and clean the meat locker. Tucker Muldowney, Donna Lumis. - Hey, how you doin'? - Nice to meet you. Well, it's nice to be loved. And I should like to warn you. A debate, as practice here, is rougher than football. - Ooh! - Meaner than ice hockey. Yeah! Much more strenuous than wrestling. And because women can play at it just as down and dirty as the men, it's probably the scariest, most fascinating sport on the face of the planet. Let's debate. Resolved. That sex education should not be taught in our public schools. Resolved! That condoms should never be sold on our high school and college campuses. Resolved. That abstinence is the best way to avoid AIDS. The affirmative will prove that the institution best suited to educating our nation's youth about sex is the family. And when the schools attempt to meddle in these matters, they are, in fact, promoting promiscuity and undermining the values of our nation. I hate this school. It's a bunch of Cretans and Neanderthals and boobs. These have the special reservoir tip. Who am I talking to? Why am I even talking to you? Hey. Hey, now, watch this. McKellar is the best. Personally, I think he's even better than Lloynd and Shields from Harvard. So let me understand your position. Are you telling us that high school and college students should abstain from having sex? Yes. So when the hormones start throbbing and some young adolescent starts feeling, uh... Horny! Okay, horny! What're you suggesting they do, Susan? What do you mean? Choke the chicken, slap the dolphin, bleed the lizards, spank the monkey! Yes, yes, that's what I'm saying. If you need to, then... Masturbate. Susan, do you masturbate? I, uh, um... Well... It's really none of your business. Do you? As rarely as possible. Mr. McKellar, you are revolting. I know. Isn't that awful? Susan, is abstinence realistic? In light of the recent report "AIDS In The Year 2000," that over one-third of our nation's teenagers are regularly engaging in sexual intercourse. You guys might want to read that. Is it realistic when we know that after homosexuals, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs, that teenagers are the highest risk group for AIDS. Of course, it's realistic. Nuns do it all the time. Uh, they abstain, I mean to say. But teenagers do not. Research proves that teenagers are as sexually inquisitive as they've always been, and that the only way to protect them is by giving them information and providing them with immediate access to protection. No, no! Wait a moment. No. This sounds as if he's saying it's okay for them to be as promiscuous as they want. No. No, Susan, that's not what I'm saying at all. All I'm saying is light is better than darkness, knowledge is better than ignorance. And it's our duty, isn't it, to make sure that the young people of our great nation don't die? Hey, you know, Monica, I'm gonna go call my folks. - Okay. - So, uh, I'll see ya. My pleasure. Take care. - Bye, guys. - Bye-bye. Hey, what do you say you let me buy you a cup of coffee. - Come on. - I can't. I have to study. Chicago, what are you afraid of? I'm not afraid of anything. I just can't date until I'm sure I can handle the work load. I'm sorry. - You were really good today. - Thanks. You're welcome. Charlie, please, nobody's trying to put you on the spot here. We all know how tough the conference is. My God, Charlie, we finished second at the pass two seasons. Nobody's implying you have slipped, but we all wanna be back on top, don't we? You win the conferences here, Gar could be debating for a national title in front of the Supreme Court this spring. And my media people tell me there's gonna be national network coverage. Charlie, you know what that means? Yeah, it means your son's face will be known to half the homes in America before he even goes to law school. 61.9 % of homes. Senator, listen, I'd kill for a national title, but I don't think your son can pull that miracle off alone. We got some terrific kids on scholarship. Maybe this will be our year, maybe it won't. Coach, just tell me you believe we can do it. Charlie, you know we can do it, don't you? We can do it. Good man. Charlie, I owe you, uh... Well, I owe you a big thanks for taking Gar under your wing like that. Thank you, sweetheart. Your son and I are good friends, but, uh, the last time I looked in the mirror, I'm sure as hell didn't see any wings. I wouldn't be surprised if you try to bolter Gar one more time before he graduates. I did. Politics is a very scary legacy to inherit. We all try to run from it as long as we can. All right. When I call your name come down and pick a subject out of this hat. Be prepared to speak for five minutes. Remember that we are restricted to a team of 30. With 15 returning debaters, that means there's only 15 open slots. "Should criminal lawyers "defend clients they believe are lying?" Definitely not. This kind of personal dishonesty is destroying the very fabric of the legal profession. It puts dangerous criminals back on the streets where they can steal, and rape, and kill again, but worst of all, it erodes our faith in justice. Now take the other side. It doesn't matter if you're guilty or innocent, you have an inalienable right to legal counsel, and a lawyer has a duty to provide it. To take away this right because some lawyer has come to some personal conclusion about the guilt of his client is to deny that person due process of law. All right, Chicago! I am here today, my friends, to urge you to bring back public hangings. No, seriously, ladies and gentlemen, how else are we going to scare our criminals into leaving us alone, unless we play for keeps? I can see it. Hangings on TV, the Friday night hanging of the week. Seriously. I mean, close-ups on their faces, the instant their neck snap. Cutaways to their children's faces, extreme close-ups of the spittle drooling from the lips of the dearly departed. Now, Hugh, uh, as you can see the color is draining rapidly from the face and the legs which stopped jerking spasmodically, and their eyes have glazed over. Yes, Barbra, you're right, but we'll have to wait for the celebrity coroner of the week to tell us if he's officially dead. Ms. Lumis, your resume tells me that in high school you had some success as a public speaker. But I should have to warn you that on the college circuit, we don't give any points on sympathy. No, I don't expect any sympathy. All the handicapped I know, Ms. Lumis, thrive on sympathy. Why should you be different? Because I don't think of myself as handicapped or crippled. This happened when I was eight. I couldn't sit upright for four years. - I shattered my hip, man. - Uh, Ms. Lumis... No, and I was in a full-body cast for the first year and a half. And my doctor said I'd never recover any feeling in my leg. Ms. Lumis... I lifted weights, and I worked out with a therapist in a hot pool 80 hours a week, for seven years, and the feeling came back, all of it. Be careful... No, you be careful. I'm fine. I'll walk again, normally, someday, and I'll ride a horse again, and maybe I'll even dance again someday. So, don't you or any of the rest of you here feel sorry for me, because I won't fucking stand for it. What this little piece of paper says is character is destiny. Now what that means to this chicken farmer's son from Watonga, Oklahoma, is this. There comes a moment in everybody's life when they choose their character. You never know when that moment's gonna come. It could be when you're 15 or when you're 50. Let's just say somebody drops a $10 bill right in your path, and there's nobody there to hold you accountable but you and your maker. What do you do? You pocket it, or do you chase after the guy who dropped it? Whatever you decide to do in that moment, you may well have chosen your character for life, and thus, your destiny. There was this kid from my school who was so poor that he had to make his shoes out of old tires. And his clothes were by that famous designer Goodwill. His diet was so deficient, that he developed rickets his freshman year of high school. He took to stealing money out of payphones and parking meters. But he got caught one day, and spent most of his sophomore year in the juvenile detention facility. The shrink said he was incorrigible, but he came back to school his junior year and pulled the highest marks in his class. When he graduated, he was snapped up by one of the best colleges in the country. Full-boat scholarship, all the trimmings. Tell me, country boy, how'd he make this big change? One dark night, in a smelly cage full of animals, he decided to stop listening to all the negative voices and all the negative people, and started believing that his own potential was infinite. - Hey, guys. - Hey. - Hi. - You were great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Can I buy you a burger or something? - Sure, absolutely. - Great. All right, everybody, place your bets. Turtle race is about to start. Come on, let's go. Come on, everybody, place your bets. Everybody's a winner. Good shot. Hey, you guys thirsty? - Yeah. Mia, Tasha, what is that back there? Hey, Gar, come back here. Hey, you want some of this action? Uh, yeah! Midnite Blues, 5 to 1. Yeah, all right. Put it all on number two. I'll be at Garson's table. Come on, don't be afraid to place your bets. Go, baby, go! Atta-turtle, atta-turtle. There is no commode. Hey, Charlie was right. You guys are terrific. I mean, you've got something this place really needs. Yeah, strong backs. No, I was going to say heart. Maybe what you think is heart is just working-class hunger. Yeah, that's part of it. You guys are both hungry. - One question, roomie. - Hmm? How do you make shoes out of old tires? It was you, wasn't it? Come on, did you go to reform school? Yeah, I did some time. So what? What was it like? Look, I really don't want to talk about it, all right? Okay, I'm sorry, I was just curious. So, um... What kind of sports do you like? Well, actually, my favorite is killing spiders with the tip of my cane. - That's a joke, right? - Yeah, that's a joke. Hey, come on, let's dance. No, Bruce, you're not paying attention. I know I came across really ballsy today at tryouts, but if you're looking for a dancing partner... No, come on. You said you want to dance again someday... Yeah, right, someday. Not now. Whoa. Why are you being so defensive? I'm sorry. It's just this whole scene, all these people, I'm not used to it. I'm sorry, um, I should've been more sensitive. - I'm just not used to being around a... - Yeah, right. I mean, um... Hey, listen, I don't think this is gonna work out. Okay? It's cool. - Donna, I'm sorry, I... - Excuse me. Ouch! Yeah, right. I gotta get to the library before it closes. I've been here only a week, and I feel like I'm already a month behind. Oh, talk to me. I've got an English lit paper due in the morning, and I haven't even started it yet. Come on, a couple of smart cookies like you two, should be able to phone it in a pool of "B"s in this place. No, we both have to pull straight "A"s. "B"s won't get us a scholarship into law school. I've got news for both of you. You start winning the debate, and I can get you names of 100 firms who'd gladly pay your way through law school. And they'll make sure you get accepted, too, regardless of your GPA. Who are these people? Political interest groups who are looking for a future legal partner, a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, maybe even a future JFK. So, when you're ready to sell your soul to the devil, you just let me know. Where the hell have you been? I have been creating the new Garson McKellar. I spent the whole summer at the typewriter. Read 'em when you can, you know? - No rush or anything. - Ah. I got news for you, Gar. This is gonna be the big year for us. Charlie, uh... I'm not too sure if I should debate anymore. Oh, God. Do I have to put up with this shit every September? But just listen. If I really wanna be a writer, if I really wanna tell my old man to shove it, I gotta stand up to him right now, right? Look, your old man is one thing, debate is something else. Is it? Debate is a road straight into law school and politics. Better I do, the less chance I have of convincing him I'm serious about my writing. How do you just walk away from debate? Because I don't love it like you, Charlie. What would you say if I told you that you could be debating in front of the Supreme Court this spring on network television, to decide the first true national championship in 15 years? That wouldn't excite you just a little bit? Just a little bit? No, not really. What's the issue? Abortion. The enemy team's debating abortion, too? I thought you weren't interested. I wouldn't mind a shot at Lloynd and Shields. I'd love to knock those egotistical bastards off their holy little mountain. Now you're talking. You guys wanna know the resolution you'll be debating over the next three months? Yeah! I thought you might. Be it resolved, that abortion is immoral. Hey, that's great. It's about time. Well, this is the year for it. That's all they're talking about back in Washington. The Supreme Court is split right down the middle. - Coach, I'm kinda confused... - Now, there's a surprise. No, no, really, the affirmative is, uh, is against and the negative is for abortion? I know. It sounds like it should be just the other way around. But the affirmative will be trying to prove that the Supreme Court ruling, giving women the right to abortions, should be overturned. The negative will be trying to prove that it should not be overturned. - You got it? - Yeah. Good. What's the name of that ruling? Uh, Roe v. Wade. Very good, Braithwaite. Now, which side looks like the easier one to defend? - The negative. - Why? Because nobody today, no educated, thinking people believe abortion's wrong, only religious fanatics, like my parents. Uh, I have to disagree, sir. You know, there are tons of arguments that it's wrong, and it's not just stuff from the Bible. I mean, some folks back where I come from feel pretty strongly that it's a form of murder. Only shit-kicker conservatives believe that crap about murder. Oh, yeah? Well, that's just what I am, baby, a shit-kicker conservative. - Yeah. - And what are you? You know, just so women can have their cake and eat it, too, they'll go off and kill millions of little unborn kids. Haven't you ever heard of pro-life? Haven't you ever heard of the women's movement? Yeah, but I wish I hadn't. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Let's divide up the research. What do you know about... - Oh. - Edwin Arlington Robinson? Garson. Well, I didn't know that you were interested in poetry. Oh, yeah. Anybody who can teach me how to be a better writer. Listen to this. See if it reminds you of anyone. "Whenever Richard Cory went downtown, "we people on the pavement looked at him. "He was a gentleman from sole to crown, "clean favored, and imperially slim. "And he was rich, yes, richer than a king. "And admirably schooled in every grace. "In fine, "we thought that he was everything "to make us wish that we were in his place." It's you. "So, on we worked and waited for the light. "And went without the meat, "and cursed the bread. "And Richard Cory, "one calm summer night, "went home and put a bullet through his head." Wanna have dinner with me tonight? I can't. I have to work. I wanna know what it feels like to really care for a girl. Take Monica. What makes a girl like that tick? You're interested in Monica? She's just an example. Do you wanna be really in love someday? Of course. Doesn't everybody? How will you know it's love and not the usual bullshit? Well it's... It's the same way you know if you're steak is good or if the lobster's fresh. You trust your senses. What would you say if I told you that I could get us both laid in about 60 minutes? You know, you're crazy. - You talk about love... - Yes or no? I have to make a phone call. Well, I gotta be to work in the next 10 minutes. Not if I arrange otherwise. You can get me out of working? Hey! Stop you party animals, take me back to that champagne! - Whoo-hoo! - Yeah! Oh Tucker, you're so strong. Put me down. Tucker, put me down! Put me down! As my good buddy Dostoyevsky once said, "Eat drink and eat drink." On the count of three, switch you're horses! Are you gonna do it or what? Oh, yeah. Will you stop it! Sorry. Little affectionate. - Back off. - Sorry. Got excited. - Professor Nichols. - Ms. Tomanski. I don't wanna be Tucker's debate partner. Yeah, well, I don't think I wanna be your partner either. Coach, you know, we'd probably just end up debating each other instead of our opponents. Maybe. Maybe it'll make you a better team. Muldowney, you should be the big gun on the affirmative. Tomanski, you should spearhead the negative. But I was really hoping you'd team me with one of the more experienced debaters. I mean, this way we could be stuck in novice all season. Look, you place in the tournament, I'll move you up to juniors. You win there, I'll bump you up to open. Now, get out of here. Both of you. Terrific. Now what do we do? We debate together, I guess. Hey, look, I wanted a hot-shot partner, too. Now, I'm gonna have to carry you all season. Carry me? Nobody ever has to carry me. - I was joking. - Especially a man. Why is everything such a political crusade with you? I didn't mean it that way, Tucker. It's just that I had such high hopes of getting off to a good start. Darling, you're off to a great start. You're with me. Maybe we can even turn out to be a good team. Provided we get it straight upfront who's boss. A joke. A joke. Okay, we have to decide who's second speaker, and that's no joke. I should be second speaker because I've had more debating experience. I think I should be second because I'm the better speaker. Do you honestly believe that? Hey, I agree, you're great, but the old wrap-up is my specialty. I mean, I can always put my audience right where I want 'em. This ridiculous. I can't wait till we start writing our case. All right, let's compromise. - You be the last speaker on the negative... - Hi Al. And I'm the last on the affirmative. Okay, I guess that'll work. See, I'm not so hard to get along with. You just better do you're share of the research. Hey now, do I look like a slacker? Mmm-hmm. Oh, now, what was that for? Look, nobody said we had to like or respect each other. And what is that supposed to mean? If you wanna date the scuzziest girls in the school, that's your business. Oh, you heard about that, huh? "Oh, Tucker, you're so strong, "put me down. Stop. Oh." You know, maybe you didn't learn as much in reform school as you thought. To me, you still look like a pretty flaky character. Hey now, just wait a damn minute. You know, if you would just stop acting like a Vestal Virgin and go out with me then maybe I wouldn't have to resort to these desperate, life-threatening alternatives. - Please. - I mean, if you look at this empirically, you'd see that this is all your fault. I was wondering, what do you do for Garson in return for his little favors? * Wop bop a loo bop a lop bom bom! * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Wop bop a loo bop a lop bom bom! * I got a girl, named Sue * She knows just what to do * I got a girl, named Sue * She knows just what to do * She rock to the east, she rock to the west * But she is the girl that I love best * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Tutti frutti, oh rutti Ooo! * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Wop bop a loo bop a lop bom bom! * I got a girl, named Daisy * She almost drives me crazy * Got a girl, named Daisy * She almost drives me crazy * She knows how to love me, yes indeed * Boy, you don't know what she do to me * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Tutti frutti, oh rutti Ooo! * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Wop bop a loo bop! * Ow! * Oh! Tutti frutti, oh rutti * Tutti frutti, oh rutti These aren't clean. Do 'em again, Tomanski. So, um, you going home for the holidays? - I can't afford it. You? - I can't afford it either. I wish I could just fly away from here, do nothing for two solid weeks, except be irresponsible. Uh, hey, since we don't have to work dinner, um, maybe you wanna come over to my place afterward? I thought maybe we could order in a pizza or, uh, listen to some music. You've never seen our room. It is like a five-star hotel. Oh, you'll love it. Well, what do you think? This here is our computer. It cost about five grand. And this is the sound system, cost about another five grand. And, um, right over there is the life cycle. Cost about two grand. Here you go. Is that your champagne or his? What difference does it make? It's his, of course, but he doesn't care. How do you know? Did you ever ask him? No, but he could've said something anytime. He likes to share his things, it makes him feel good. Did he say that? No, but you can tell he gets off on it. We'll have to pay him back. I won't drink any of this unless you agree to pay half. Are you out of your mind? You know, a bottle of this stuff runs over 20 bucks. If I don't teach you anything else in this life, Muldowney, I'm gonna teach you this. Now, come on, cough it up. Come on, dig real deep. - You're serious? - I'm serious. - You're serious. - Yes. Oh, I can't believe this. - And $10. Here you go. - Yes, yes. Good boy. Believe me, you'll feel a lot better for doing this. No, I won't. That $10 was for the pizza. We'll manage. Now, what shall we toast to? Oh, I know! To being the number three team on the squad. Well, couldn't you come up with something a little more romantic? Live with it. - Monica. - Uh... Why won't you go out with me? Told you, I have to put my studies ahead of everything else. You sure it doesn't have anything to do with Garson? What do you mean? Well, for a little ol' gal from the south side of Chicago, that would seem like a much better catch than some poor chicken farmer's son. You really have a chip on your shoulder, don't you? Hey, how am I supposed to feel? Okay, okay, if it isn't Garson, then... Then why are you so standoffish? I mean, look at you. You're sitting so far away. I'd have to mail you a letter just to make contact. I'm like this with everyone, Tucker. I know, but, but why? I mean, did I do something? Why? Because that's who I am. Listen, I knew this was a mistake. Have a great Christmas break, Tucker, okay? Damn! What? Huh? What? What do you want? How about just a simple hug, Chicago? You look like somebody who needs one. Yeah, well, knowing you, there's got to be a trick in there somewhere, right? Trust me. This place is so hard. Sometimes I think I'm not gonna make it. Of course, you're gonna make it. You're just tired, that's all. How much you're working on with about five hours of sleep. - That's what I think. - Four. Unless that boy on the first floor is working on his lats, I'd say you're shaking. Shut up, okay? I'm sort of liking this. Oh. I'm sorry, did I interrupt something? Oh, no, you didn't interrupt anything. Tucker and I were studying. Um... We borrowed a bottle of champagne but we wanted to pay you for it. So, here, and I'll... Forget about it. I'm glad you're here. I was just heading home in a couple of hours. How would you guys like to come spend the holidays with me? Is that a yes? - Yeah. - Yeah. * Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while * Hey, how fast we going? - 80. At 95, the turbos will cut in and she'll lay rubber. Don't you dare! Oh, man! Oh, man, if my dad could see me now. Hey, I don't suppose you let anybody else drive this, do ya? - You could drive it. - Yeah? You're not serious, are you? Yeah, I'm serious. Chickenman can drive. Yeah, the Chickenman can drive. * Can you imagine when this race is won? * Turn our golden faces into the sun * Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune * The music's played by the, the madman * Ah. - Are you nuts? - I trust the Chickenman. Yeah, he trusts the Chickenman. I'm gonna walk. You know, I like walking down the beach... - Sit down! - Sit down! * Forever, and ever * Forever young * I want to be forever young * Do you really want to live forever? * Forever, and ever * Forever young * I want to be forever young * Do you really want to live forever? * Merry Christmas. Hi, Merry Christmas. Good to see you. Meet some friends of mine, Monica and Tucker. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. Monica, Tucker. - Hi. - Hi. Well, you two look like the real thing. Gar used to bring home such phonies. Thank you, Dad. Well, thanks. You've got a beautiful home here. Reminds me a lot of my own. Really? What are the similarities? Exact some color. * Forever young * I want to be forever young * Do you really want to live forever? * I'll tell you who the best President of the United States was. Harry S. Truman. Now, nobody owned him. - He gave the finger to... - Harry did that? Uh, excuse me, ma'am. Talk to me just as you'd talk to any other man, Tucker. Well, he gave the finger to all the special interest groups. The Unions, Congress, everybody. His only allegiance was to the people. So, um, is either of you considering a career in politics? I am, sir. What about you, Monica? Well, I never gave it much thought, ma'am, but I see now that I might have to go into politics to save the world from him. Gar, looks like you got a little competition. Dad, I'm sorry, but I don't want to follow the family tradition. I wanna start a whole new tradition. I'm writing a play. It's sort of a comic expose of political life. My plans are, if Charlie likes the work, I'm dropping out of everything. Tennis, student council, debate. I'm concentrating totally on my writing. If you draw a judge who has just lost a child to leukemia, - what do you do? - Make him laugh. Right. If you draw a judge who's flirting with you, what do you do? - Flirt back. - Right! If the judges are members of the John Birch Society, what do you do? Wear a flag and rebel. This is the way debates, matters of the heart, and unfortunately, general elections are won. Where's Garson? Uh, he's with his dad. Um, we have one for the computer. How do you sell abortion to a Catholic judge? Let me tell you a story. Before Roe v. Wade, if a young lady found herself in the family way, she had to resort to the lowest and seamiest people in her life to find a back-alley abortionist. My mother had a back-alley abortion. She was 19. She went to a filthy hotel on the wrong side of town. The sleazebag doctor met her there. He said, "Take off your dress. Drop your pants." Then he laughed and said, "If you hadn't dropped your pants in the first place, "this wouldn't have happened." Then, he said, "I want my payment in advance." Naked, my mother walked in front of him over to her purse. Got the $1,000 out of it, and handed it to him. Then, he said, "How would you like to make $100 back?" My mother said, "What?" He said, "Just come over here, and kneel down, sweetheart, "and make an old man happy." My mother was repulsed. She said, "Just take care of it." So, he put her up on a wooden table, and he took a long, cold instrument and shoved it up into her uterus, and began scrapping out the fetus. Blood spurted out all over her. My mother thought she was gonna die. When she arrived home, after two hours on a bus, she had lost so much blood that they had to rush her to a hospital in an ambulance. But she was lucky. She lived. I was lucky. She lived long enough to give birth to me. But, in the '40's, the law was perfectly willing to slap her into jail for 20 years, for participating in this. Except for the relative that told me, she never told this story to another soul. Um, excuse me, I don't understand. How do you sell abortion to a Catholic judge? Tell 'em the story of your mother. My mother never had an abortion. Neither did mine. You think I didn't have dreams of my own? I was a damn good musician in those days, but my father said to me the same thing I'm saying to you. "Michael," he said, "We have a responsibility as a family, to this country. "That's why God gave us all these blessings." But I'm not like you and Grandpa. Thank you, sweetheart. Look, Gar, you're a thoroughbred, son. You're coming out of the gate. Now, you take this dream of Grandpa's, this McKellar dream, and you bring it home. You owe that to your family, to your generation, to your country. Did you read any of my stories that I left at Christmas? I don't need to. Your mother read 'em. She said they were fine. What do you want? You want me to make a phone call and get them published? You wanna have a play on Broadway next year? Dad, stop patronizing me. Well, I'll do whatever you want, but you gotta do what I want, too. That's called manhood. * Yeah! * Far in the sky, it don't matter * It's all just a state of mind * Rise up the weight of the world * And drag it down your side * Write up a list of your violence * They're gonna toss it to the ground * Oh, tomorrow * Opening the river's run * Come on, the night is still young * If we can't do it, it can't be done * Charlie, you know how much money the McKellar family gives to the school each year. Or how much winning a National Debate Championship could bring in? Suppose... Suppose the play is brilliant. You're not gonna let him quit. Just listen, Schwimmer. We're not supposed to be programing these kids into some mold that you or I with the family think that they belong in. I'm just telling you, if there is any merit at all in that play, I am going to let him quit. Do it and even you're tenure won't protect you. Now what's that supposed to mean? What it means is, I want that boy debating! - How is it going, Dostoyevsky? - I just finished it, Charlie. You gonna love it. Hmm. Ah, thank you. Mmm. - Kid, behave yourself. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So what do you think? Why do I get the impression you are gonna base a life-time decision on what I think of this play. It's good, isn't it, Charlie? But if I say I love it, would you quit debate? Maybe. Then how do you expect me to be honest? Because you're my friend. I got to get out of trap before it's too late, Charlie. If we win the conference and go to Washington and my old man's machine cracks into action, it's gonna be too late. Is that play good or isn't it? The way you've been acting, it's like you are afraid to tell me that it stinks. Am I kidding myself with this, Charlie, or do I have a chance, huh? Tell me. You ask too much of me. Make your own decisions. I think it's only fair to warn you up-front that my partner and I often disagree. That you watch, we usually end up debating each other, instead of our opponents. Oh, and it gets very entertaining. Just last week, at the Berkeley tournament, she tried to gouge my eyes out with her fingernails. See the scratches? Tucker can be very charming, I'll give you that. But if you listen closely, when it's time for his rebuttal, you'll see. He'll give you his best Okey drawl, two down home homilies, pile of BS. If he gives you so much as one piece of documented evidence, I'll eat my shoe. The affirmative argue that the fetal viability standard, presented in Roe v. Wade, is on a collision course with itself. There are three reasons why this is false. One. Doctor Alan Fleischman, Director of Neonatology in New York City's Montefiore Medical Center, stated that even at the most sophisticated hospital, babies born before the 24th week have no chance of survival. I would argue, two. Time magazine reported on July 6th 1987, page 83, that fewer than 1 % of the 1.5 million abortions performed in the United States each year occurred after the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. And finally, three. Janet Benshoof, Director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, concluded that Roe v. Wade is not on collision course with itself. Well, wonders never cease. They are all kinds of abortions. Any time life and freedom are cut short, it's an abortion. It doesn't matter, if you're in the first trimester, or the second trimester, or if you're 22 years old. Anytime a human being denies another human being the right to life, liberty, or the simple pursuit of his own special dream, it's an abortion. And it's an abomination in the eyes of God! My duty on behalf of the Cross Examination Debate Association, to award this year's national title to Kenmont College. Coach! Coach! Coach! Thank you. Thank you very much. We have just learned that over at Princeton University, about an hour ago, the NDT title was won by Harvard University. So that means it'll be Lloynd and Shields versus Chin and McKellar at Washington. Excuse me... Taxi. Hey, I got an idea. What you say we unload this stuff and take a subway to Times Square? Come on, we'll celebrate. It's late. Well, then let's go up to bar on the roof and dance for half hour or so. Take it easy, guys. - Good night. - See you later. - Tuck, bye. - Good night. What was that for? For not giving up. Good night, Tuck. Hey, lady, you ever heard about lifting cars? You know, that I lift cars every damn night waiting for you. What does that mean, "lifting cars"? Ask any guy. Hey, what do you mean by about "not giving up"? It's me, okay? It has nothing to do with you. I'll see you at breakfast. You look beautiful. Thank you. What's wrong? Bruce wants me to meet him up at the roof to watch everybody dance, - and I'm scared. - Why? Because I don't know what he expects from me. Maybe he doesn't expect anything. Maybe he's just in love with you. Maybe that's what I'm scared of the most. - You want to come with me? - I am too tired. Besides, I didn't bring anything else to wear except my debate clothes. Well, if you change your mind then you can use anything in my closet. Thank you. Here goes nothing. Wish I had half your guts. Oh, believe me, I wish I had half my guts. Donna, I was wondering, what did Tucker mean when he said "lifting cars"? Um, he meant that he is dying of terminal horniness. Guys say that they lift cars to relieve the ache in their balls. Oh! Oh. Bye. * Around your love * I wanna go where no one's ever been before * I'm satisfied this... - Want to get out of here? - What does that mean? You know what that means. Sorry. Hey, Nath! How about letting me dance with Susan, huh? - It's up to her. - I'd love to. What? You said I could dance with anyone I wanted to. Within our species. Bruce, if you want to dance, go ahead and ask anyone. It's okay. Go ahead. May I have this dance? Don't you ever hear anything I say to you? I can't do this! I can't dance! Bruce, what are you doing? Donna Lumis... I love you. Aw. I love you. * The feel in the air gets tighter * The fire in your eyes gets brighter * * Nobody's better Making it look easy * You're slowly driving these boys crazy * Garson, hi. Have you seen Tucker? No. Look at you. Do you want a drink? Okay. This is a Cordon Bleu. Would you like to try some? Sure. Whoa! You have to take it easy with that stuff. Oh. Ah, that's good. Can I get another one? Could I have another one? She's the boss. Two, please. So, uh... What's with you and Tucker anyway? You two getting it on? Tucker and me? Be serious. You sure about that? Why should it matter to you? Whoa, hang on. I'm asking the question, here. Oh. So if you're not into Tucker then what's the deep, dark reason why you never go out on a date? Garson, I've had enough cross ex for one day. How would you like it if I asked you why such an intelligent man, as yourself, dates such shallow people? No, I don't mind answering that. It's because I don't know the first thing about real love. All I've ever seen are abortions of love. Love of power, the love of money. Hasn't anyone ever dated you for you and not all that other stuff? Well, if they were that way when they walked in door, they sure didn't leave that way. You see, I have this incredible knack of bringing out the worst in people. Nice quality. Now you. Why do you work so hard to hide this beauty from the world? Well for one thing, I'm not a big exhibitionist. Oh, no, you don't. The affirmative is convinced that there is more to it than that. Resolved. Some boy hurt you. You tell me what his name is and I'll break his kneecaps. You're wrong. No boy ever hurt me. Then who did? Garson, would you like to dance? - Sure. - Okay. * Every woman here can see Every man would kill to be * Who's gonna love you tonight * Who's gonna love you * Who's gonna love you tonight * Who's gonna love you * Who's gonna love you tonight * Every woman here can see * Every man would kill to be * Who's gonna love you tonight * Who's gonna love you tonight * Uh, do you want to come in and listen to some music? It's after 1:00, and we have to catch a plane tomorrow. Come on, Tomanski, would you just relax for once in your life? If I get any more relaxed, you'd have to carry me into my room. Okay. Just for a little while, all right? Just for a... Just for a little while. Okay. Garson, it's really late, and I'm feeling kind of dizzy from those cognacs. Relax for a bit, you can leave whenever you want. Okay. Look at you. What are you afraid of? - It's just me. - Oh, I know. It's just, um... I feel like I shouldn't be here, I guess. Why, 'cause you afraid you might want to seduce me? No. Well, you don't think I'm out to seduce you, do you? I don't know, are you? No, but I want to know you better. What I said to you upstairs was true. I know absolutely nothing about how to relate to nice girls. Girls that don't always want something from you. But you like me for me, right, Monica? Of course. I got to get to bed. Wait, there's so much on my mind right now, don't leave me yet, please. What is it, Garson? Monica, I feel so trapped. You know, I wish I had your confidence or Tucker's, the way you guys both seem to know exactly where you're going. Maybe you see things in Tucker and me that aren't really there. No. You see things in me that aren't really there. You going to way beyond anything I ever did at debate, Monica, I'm sure of that. That's very sweet of you to say. I hope you're right. I got to go. Wait, Monica. If I had someone like you who believed in me, it would be so much easier. Garson, you are hurting my arm. Wait, Monica, wait. What do you want? I've given you the wrong impression. All I want is a friend. I'm not coming onto you, Monica. Garson, you are drunk. No, I'm not drunk. Let me out. No. Not until I'm sure you understand. There's nothing to understand. We both just drank too much, okay? Then why are you running away? Because I'm afraid. So am I. I want you, Monica, I need you so much. Stop! Oh God, let me out! - Stop! - What the hell's the matter with you? - Stop it! - What have I got to do with you? - Help me! Somebody help me! - Shut up! Monica, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. - I'm sorry. - Don't touch me. - Please, don't touch me. - I'm not going to hurt you. Wait, let me get a washcloth. Oh, God. Monica! Hey, Monica? Monica? Monica? - Help me! - Hey, hey, it's okay. It's me. It's Tucker. - Oh, Tucker. - Easy, easy. You're going to okay. Calm down. You're all right. You're okay. Here, take my coat. Hey, you kids okay? Yeah, how much to Tearton hotel? Our minimum's $40. Okay, that's fine. Monica, what happened? Who did this to you? It's going to be all right. Come on, I'll help you to you room. I really want to be alone, okay? I got to go, all right. Hey, my 40 bucks? Thanks. Garson, I want to talk to you. Hello, country boy. I'm just here having a drink with my buddy Dostoyevsky. What did you do to her? Now there's a writer. His family tried to force him into being an engineer, and he said... What did you do to her, man? Hey, what she do, make up some story? Monica never made up a story in her life, and you know it. So now what happened, damn it? Nothing happened, all right? Why don't you just settle down. You want a drink? No. Look, I don't want anything from you, I just want you to be straight. I'm being straight! Nothing happened, all right? We had a little misunderstanding. That girl's got real problems. You know, she imagines things. So what did she imagine? She's crazy, all right, Tucker? She actually thought that I was trying to rape her. Can you imagine that? Me, the next President of these United States. You bastard! Hey, stop. Stop! Both out of here. Get out! Cool down... - Get out of here. - Stay out. You snake! You're not a friend. You're just like every other rich asshole in this world. You use people like us for kicks. Don't give your poor-boy bullshit. I never did for any friend in this world, and you took it to use me every chance you got. That's a lie. No, I didn't! Don't tell me you don't go home at night thinking of ways that I could help you in your political career. I think Monica was right. I overestimated you, Muldowney. You and your smelly cage full of animals, you're full of shit. Get out! All right, I bought into it. Like everybody else, I wanted to be just like you. I wanted to have it all. Did it ever once occur to you that maybe I envy you as much as you envy me? Did it? That's crazy, man. I don't have shit. No, you're wrong, Chickenman. You've got it all, but you don't even realize it. I'm the one who's got shit. Outside of Charlie Nichols there's not a single goddamn person in this world I can trust. Well, you can't even trust him, homey. What are you saying? Your beloved Charlie Nichols, he's been controlling you for years. Your father has been using him to keep you in line. You're lying! Bastard, I'm going to kick your ass. Tuck, look out. Garson! Oh, God! God help me. Somebody get an ambulance! Get an ambulance! Don't die. Garson, don't die. No. Jesus! Garson. The Dean is issuing a formal statement of default to the NDT today. I said that was all right with me, but I wanted to talk to you first. Why us? The rules say, if the first team can't go, the second team takes its place. That's you. You beat out Gore and Hooper by one point in New York. We never debated open, we wouldn't stand a chance. Ah, come on, we don't deserve to go. I shouldn't even be alive. We're not Garson and Chin. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. That's a lot of crap. What if I told you you were better than Garson, and he knew it. You the best freshman team I've ever coached. You're not saying we go to Washington. I mean, those guys... Those guys have debated together for last eight years. They've won the NDT title for last three years straight. So what? Let's get something straight about Garson, too. I know you loved him as much as I did, but he wasn't a God. He was just a kid wanting to live out his own dream and nobody would let him, especially me. That's my problem. Your problem is, are you going to cut short your own dreams, just quit, default to Harvard, or try to live up to the potential that Gar saw in you, and put up a fight? I thought the Dean was planning on defaulting us. You face-up to your fears I'll face up to mine. What do you say, Tomanski? What's it going to be, Muldowney? What you got to lose? - Okay. - All right. Good. Good. Good... Miriam, ring me as soon as the NDT call comes through. They don't want to quit Wilson, and I don't want to quit either. You pick up that phone and I'm going to shove it right up your pompous ass. I'm asking for investigation into this mess, and it's going to cost you your professorship! Who cares? I'm going to tell the whole world how we kept that kid captive here, how we took away his God-given freedoms - for our selfish motives. - Not me. Oh, not you. Oh, no. What happened is New York was your responsibility. Everything I've ever done I've done for the good of the school. Bullshit! You and I killed that boy. And I'm going to be around to remind you of that every time you look over your shoulder. All right, go ahead take them. - Send the freshmen. - I'll do that. But you know as well as I they don't stand a chance. Don't be too sure of that! Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We're in an anteroom to the Supreme Court for the first true National Debate Championship in 15 years. Judging today's debate are five of the nine-members of the Supreme Court of the United States. Representing the NDT, the National Debate Tournament, Harvard College. Representing the CEDA, the Cross Examination Debate Association, Kenmont College. Call it, Kenmont. Uh, heads. Tails. Harvard, do you wish to debate the affirmative or the negative? Harvard will debate the negative. Your flying low won't do any good. Oh, jeez! I went on television like that. All rise. Be seated. Kill 'em. All right, here we go. These Harvard boys have egos bigger than their brains. Feed those egos, don't fight them. Maybe we get them to lower their guard a bit. Okay, let's kick ass. Let the debate begin. Go Kenmont! The affirmative will prove that abortion is neither legally, nor philosophically justified. Legally we will argue that the Supreme Court's proper role is to uphold and interpret the constitution. Not arrogantly legislate their private moral views into law, as they did in Roe v. Wade. Besides, condemning judicial activism, we will also argue that that this decision has promoted sexually irresponsible behavior, by making abortion so accessible and morally sanctioned, that it has become our nation's main form of birth control. Philosophically, we will suggest that abortion is a cancer, eating away the moral fabric of this society and that it places unfair responsibilities on women. But before I continue, I'd just like to say on behalf of my partner and myself, that this is the greatest honor of our lives. To be standing before you esteemed ladies and gentlemen of the highest court in this land. And to be debating the renowned Harvard team of Lloynd and Shields. We expect to learn a great deal from you today, gentlemen. - Tell me, Miss Tomanski. - Yes. Would you deny an abortion to the victim of incest or rape? To a woman whose life or health were in danger? Absolutely not. We are simply saying that Roe v. Wade is unjustified because it is improper for the Supreme Court to create laws. That's why we have legislatures. Have you offered these judges any evidence that all 50 states would grant women their right to abortion? How could I? There's no way of knowing for sure what each state would do. The Washington Post has stated, "The returning the regulation of abortion back to the state, "would result in bitterness and divisiveness, "legislative struggle, litigation, "women forced to long distances for legal abortion. "And poor people forced into having "dangerous back-alley abortions." You have the counter evidence to these conclusions? I have one last question, Miss Tomanski. You claim that you support a woman's right to abortion, but that it should be voted on by the state, right? Right. If you are so willing to let a male dominated state legislature, vote on whether or not you have the right to abortion, will you let them vote next year on whether or not you have the right to free speech? No more questions. Before Roe v. Wade, there were only, uh, 98,000 illegal abortions performed in the United States. Now, compare that with the current rate of 1.5 million legal abortions per year, and you can easily see that that would leave us with 1.4 million babies that could be adopted immediately. We'd like to know the source and date of those statistics, Mr. Muldowney. Yeah, well, that would take us a little while to dig out of our files. Go digging, Mr. Muldowney. Help me. I don't know where I put it. The evidence is from Thomas H. Hilder. - Thomas H. Hilder. - Yes. Isn't it a fact that professor Carl Djerassi of Stanford University, wrote in the April 1986, Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, that Hilder's illegal abortion estimates are based on exaggerated maternal mortality figures? I'm not gonna con you, they're killing us. - Professor Nichols... - Please! Please, not now, not now. But remember, to pull this thing out, we only have to win one of our two arguments. The legal or the philosophical. And we only need three of the five judges to go along with us. - Oh, is that all? - Be serious, this is hopeless. It's not hopeless! It's just one of those moments in life you're always talking about, Muldowney. Have we got a pocket for $10, or go chasing after the guy? Then what are we supposed to do? I want you to pick an argument you think you can win. But we're certainly not winning with the legal. Then go for the philosophical. Give them your best rhetoric. We can't win this thing on facts, then we damn well better win it on drama. What drama? You'll have to find that in yourselves. This is ridiculous. Hey, forget that junk. It's not in there. Then where is it? What I am about to tell you is something I haven't told anyone in four very long years. Not my parents. Not a single friend. No one. The reason I'm telling you this today, is because I realized, very recently, that life may not be the long ride we think it will be. And because there's obviously no other way to cut through these cold statistics and rational opinion and give you, men in particular, a true look into the hearts of women. When I was 14 years old, I was raped by one of the bartenders who worked in my father's bar. I got pregnant, and I had an abortion. Afterwards, I couldn't trust men at all. I couldn't relax. Or feel anything. And I carried around with me this deep depression about life. And I blamed it, with all the rest, on the rape. But this year I realized that the abortion had affected me just as much. You see, abortion is a deceptive issue. When it's happening all loaded up on Demerol, it doesn't seem like such a big deal. Just a minor operation to remove a major problem. But later, sometimes, years later, it hits you what you've done. It doesn't just hit you, it devastates you. For some women, this awareness comes when they watch a movie, when they see kids playing in the park. For me it came when I saw a close friend of mine dying. Yes, I had an abortion. And I'd do it again if I was raped. But what I realized, the night that my friend died, was that life, born and unborn, is precious. And waste even one life, even the life that I wasted, is so very sad. Don't you see the bind we women are in? With Roe v. Wade you gave us the freedom we needed. The freedom we deserved! To be the final voice of what happens to our own bodies. But on the other hand, you gave us a cross too heavy for any woman or man to carry alone. Because you gave us the God-like power, to terminate life. Biologically, this responsibility falls on the female, but ethically, it should fall equally on the male. You men in general don't want to know anything about this, do you? You women, most of you, wouldn't mind sweeping all these questions under the carpet, but you're both wrong. You're both running from the responsibility we all have in matters where human life is at stake. And the day we stop running and fighting, and we start talking to each other about it, is the day that we can finally call ourselves a civilized nation. Oh, that was brilliant! You were fantastic! If you believe that one, I've got one hell of a bridge to show you that just happens to be for sale. I quote, "If you are losing a debate, be prepared to say anything to turn it around." End quote. We've all read your brilliant text book, coach Nichols. So let's nudge this debate back onto a more factual foundation. Shall we? Harvard has dismantled the affirmative position on every key issue. We have defended freedom of choice for women. And stressed the right of individuals not to be coerced by government on sensitive personal issues, like abortion. Kenmont's failure to offer any kind of a plan that would improve on the status quo, is the greatest indication of all, that what we've been hearing all day from our worthy opponents, is just a lot of hot California air. We are very confident that you will vote negative. What we need is a plan! - Then give them one. - I don't have one! Of course you do. You're the wrap up specialist, aren't you? So go wrap it all, Muldowney. Mr. Muldowney, your time has already started. At the start of the season, Coach said that we would have to learn to see and feel the other side as if it were our own. I thought he was out of his mind. See, I thought the rich were to blame for all the country's problems. And I thought that women were the bad guys in the battle of the sexes. But then I met a young man who was very rich, and he taught me that the rich have problems just like everybody else, and that being poor is no excuse for anything. And then, I met this young lady, who thought me that I don't know the first thing about women, or what they're going through today. And the conclusion I came to is this. We are all in this boat together! Rich and poor! Old and young. Men and women! And we are all scared and unsure today, because our whole moral structure, as a nation, is crumbling. And we don't know what to do about it. You want a plan? Well, the first step is to realize that decisions like Roe v. Wade, have inadvertently contributed to an overall breakdown in this nation's character. I mean, look around! We have lost the backbone of our founding fathers! Their pride and passion! About work and the family. And replaced it with a consumer culture, that we are all hooked on like junkies. Everything is too easy for us! If we can't make our marriages work, we'll go and get a quickie divorce. If we can't afford something, we'll put it on credit and leave a legacy of debt for the next generation. And if we get a little sloppy about our birth control, we'll walk in and get an abortion. The next step in this plan, is a nationally funded education effort. Aimed at making all of us aware of how we have been abusing our freedoms, and what we need to do to regain our integrity as human beings. You see, I am not saying that abortion is wrong. But not training the young to approach sex and contraception as everybody's sacred responsibility, is wrong. Making one gender pay the price for our sins, is wrong! Not valuing human life, born and unborn, is wrong! Mmm. I'd like to close with a quote from a good buddy Dostoyevsky that pretty well sums up the affirmative position, "Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny "with the object of making men and women happy in the end, "giving them peace and rest at last. "But that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature..." That little baby beating its breast with its fist, for instance. "And to found that edifice, "that wonderful new world..." On that child's unavenged tears. "Would you consent to be the architect on those conditions? "Tell me. "And tell the truth." - He did it! - Yeah! I'm so proud of you. Now you didn't faint. Respect, sir. The judges will give their decisions based on their seniority. Justice Patterson? I thought that Harvard dominated the debate with their research and polish as a team. Negative. Justice Goodman? I found the West Coast team very appealing. Very sympathetic. This national character issue is a fresh, new approach. Affirmative. Justice Tarlton? Well, uh, I thought both teams did a very nice job with the women's right issue. But it seemed to me that, uh, Harvard was the more persuasive. Negative. Justice Brooderworth. Don't read more into this, boys, than it's worth. This is a collegiate debate, not a true vote. I believe in Roe v. Wade. But I believe this Kenmont team is right about a national educational campaign on abortion. I also think it's time we got back to a deeper value system in this nation. Kenmont. It's two on two, I don't believe it. Justice Blyleven. Kenmont. Yes! We did it! We better get outta here before the press gets here. - The press? - Come on, Muldowney, let's get out of here. Unbelievable! Oh, God! Tucker, do you realize what just happened? We just beat the best collegiate debate team in history. And I wish he could have seen it. Oh, he would have been so proud. - I just got one question for you... - I feel so free! I never thought people could feel this free. You didn't make that up, did you? No wonder you never trusted me. I trust you now. * Hold me * I will hold you * Listen to me while I speak my heart * You can talk to me * We're all looking for a place to start * Where we tell the truth again * Tell the truth again * Lover * Life is closing in from everywhere * There's so little time to show we care * Say the words that show our hearts * Won't you listen to me * Knowing how we fall * Listen to me * Knowing love is all * I am in you * And you are in me * Through each other's eyes * We see * Listen to me * Hold me * I will hold you * Listen to me while I speak my heart * You can talk to me * We're all looking for a place to start * Where we tell the truth again * Tell the truth again * Love me * Listen to me, life is not that long * And we don't have time to get it wrong * Let's believe and let's begin * Let's begin * Won't you listen to me * Knowing how we fall * Listen to me * Knowing love is all * I am in you * And you are in me * Through each other's eyes * We see * Listen to me * Won't you listen to me * For we know how we fall * Listen to me * Knowing love is all * I am in you * And you are in me * Through each other's eyes * We see * Won't you listen to me * For we know how we fall * Listen to me * Knowing love is all * I am in you * And you are in me * Through each other's eyes * We see * Listen to me * For we know how we fall * Knowing love is all * I am in you * And you are in me * Through each other's eyes * We see * Just how good our lives * Could be * Through each other's eyes * We see * Listen to me * Listen to me * Listen to me
