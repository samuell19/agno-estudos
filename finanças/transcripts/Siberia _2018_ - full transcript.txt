[WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA] [SIGHING] PYOTR: Lucas, it's Pyotr. You ready to get rich? You better be. There is one small thing I will need to tell you. Or maybe not so small. Maybe quite big in fact. So hurry, please. St. Petersburg is not the same without you. Dasvidaniya. WOMAN: Your jet's boarding in ten minutes. May I top you off? [SIGHING] - Raisa. - Good morning, Mr. Hill. - Always a pleasure. Are you well? - Of course. Pyotr left. An hour ago. - Left, meaning? - Men were here, asking about him. When I told him this, he grew agitated. He said you should meet him in Mirny. At the... Gorynch Guest House. Then, he left. Can you get me into his room? [BELL DINGING] [BEEPING] [DOOR CLOSING] [PYTOR SPEAKING] I'm at the hotel, Pyotr. Where we're supposed to meet Volkov in exactly... ...thirty-seven minutes, with a sample of the blues, in case you've forgotten. I don't care what kind of shit you've stepped in... ...Boris Volkov isn't a good man to disappoint. So, where's the sample, Pyotr? I know you. You've figured out some clever place... ...some childish fucking trick. I need to know where. So, call me back please. Fucking Pyotr. Fifty... million... dollars. I can assure you, Mr. Hill, it requires effort to gather this. I exerted myself. How do you imagine I'm feeling now, sitting here... ...learning I might've done this for nothing? Your responsibility was to procure a sample... ...no? A single diamond... ...blue in color. It seems like such a... ...simple thing. And yet? [SIGHING] Huh? [LAUGHING] South Africans are in town. Vincent de Bruin and his band of cretins. I know nothing about that. I hope this is true. I'd hate to think they were somehow involved in your... ...unfortunate delay. If I can just draw on your patience... Patience, Mr. Hill... ...is like air in a sealed room. No matter how much you start with... ...eventually, you'll run out. Hm? I'll be back in two days. - With a sample? - The whole allotment. Compensation for your... ...regrettable tardiness, hm? Two percent. An even million. I'll see you in two days, Mr. Hill. Two days. Two days. [PHONE RINGING] [PYOTR SPEAKING RUSSIAN ON VOICEMAIL] I take off for Mirny in two hours. You better be there. This is my new number. Fucking call me, Pyotr. Mr. Hill, yes? Pyotr said his American friend would be coming... ...and that I should give you his room, and ask you to wait for him. - Would you like me to escort you upstairs? - No. Thank you. - Room three. - Anywhere still open for a drink? Up the street. There's a cafe. But you need a warmer coat, I think. I packed for St. Petersburg. - Then, you will be cold. - [PHONE RINGING] That is for you, I believe. A man called, twenty minutes ago. [PHONE RINGING] For the American. [PHONE RINGING] - Yes? - I thought we were friends. I thought we had an understanding. We never had an understanding. But we're still friends, right? I'm friends with everyone, Vincent. You know that. Yeah, you see, so quickly, we arrive right at the heart of the problem... ...you need to be more selective. Because the friends that you have now... ...they're cheating you. [SPEAKING AFRIKAANS] I want you to take whatever that Boris Volkov has promised you... ...I want you to add five percent. That's what my associates and I are willing to offer. Can you picture that sum? Know what I'm picturing? You and I, face down in the Neva... ...side by side, like the good friends we are. We guarantee safe passage, a private jet... ...before anyone even realizes you've left the country. You have no idea what he's offering. Would I even be calling if that were the case? There's no need to say yes right now. Just... ...just don't say no. Lucas?

Huh? - Yefrem! - [MEN LAUGHING] [SLAMMING GLASS] [LAUGHING] [DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING] [SHOUTING, LAUGHING] What? You are worried I've never seen a penis before? - I thought... - They're laughing now. For three hours they drank here, and then you... such a hero... ...you threw them out before they had to pay. Americans... ...you think money solves everything. Take the bottle. You paid for it. [DOOR OPENING] [WIND GUSTING] [BOTH LAUGHING] [BOTH LAUGHING] [ENGINE STARTING] [CAR DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING] Hey. American, wake up. Hey! - [GRUNTING] - [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] [TRAIN WHISTLE CONTINUING] [RAILWAY CROSSING DINGING] [SHOWER RUNNING] [SHOWER RUNNING] [SHOWER RUNNING] [PYOTR SPEAKING RUSSIAN ON VOICEMAIL] The least you can do is let me know if you're okay, Pyotr. Just pick up the fucking phone and call me. [SIGHING] What are you doing? - French toast. - Mm-hmm. I know what it is. Why are you cooking it? A gesture of gratitude, which I believe you're owed. Along with an apology, if I'm not mistaken. Do people apologize in America for being stupid? Not often. But it's still considered good form. Well, then, I accept your apology. Come. Eat. Not much of a talker, are you? Who is Pyotr? [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [SPITTING] Try. Mmm. - These are delicious. - Mm-hmm. My brother's wife. She is not good for much, but she is good for this. What would you do if I asked you to sleep with me? Now? Mm-hmm. I'd say... [CLEARING THROAT] ...with the most possible regret... ...that I need to go find someone... - ...that it's very urgent. - Your mysterious Pyotr? His brother, Andrei. Are you asking? He thinks it's something that has already happened... ...which means everyone else will soon think this, too. So... ...why shouldn't I make it so? That's not the best come-on I've ever heard. - Where's your friend's brother? - At the mine. I want to catch him when he comes off his shift. I will take you. And then, if we still don't hate each other... ...we come back here. Agreed? You're very forward. You find this unappealing? Quite the contrary. [BUZZER SOUNDING] For God's sake. Not here. Follow in your car. He flew in yesterday. Then left again immediately. Because? Samsonov's men. They were here, looking for him. Who the fuck is Samsonov? Pyotr didn't tell you? A bad man. Smuggling, drugs, prostitution. He and his men... ...they are former Spetsnaz members. You know Spetsnaz? Special forces? Why are they looking for Pyotr? Pyotr sold Samsonov some diamonds, blue diamonds. My diamonds? Fakes. The fuck are you talking about? He thought it was good way to double the money. Samsonov wouldn't know they weren't real. They were treated. - It's interesting. You take diamonds... - I know what treated means, Andrei. Not like this. Very high quality. New technique. Anyways, here is my number. It is secure. A friend of your wife? That supposed to mean something? [CAR ENGINE STARTING] - RUSSIAN MAN: [ON PHONE] Hello. - It's Lucas Hill. - How soon can we be airborne? - Good morning Mr. Hill. No flying today, nor tomorrow. Maybe, God willing, day after. I don't have time to play this. Just tell me who I need to pay. - Who controls the weather? - What? You want to fly today? Find the man who controls the weather. - [HORN HONKING] - That's who you need to pay. What's wrong with the weather? In Mirny, there is very little that is not wrong. [ENGINE STARTING] I do not need to know what that was about. But if you are some sort of spy, I will not be happy. I'm not a spy. So, how you say in English? Good news, bad news? Which do you want first? I've had enough bad for the moment. Give me the good. I do not hate you yet. And the bad? Your not-spying took too much time. I need to go open the cafe. You're not disappointed? [CHUCKLING] Of course I'm disappointed. [WIND GUSTING IN DISTANCE] How long this time? There and back, if I'm lucky. Well, play nice with those poor Muscovites. It's St. Petersburg this time. And you know me... I always play nice. [WIND GUSTING IN DISTANCE] [WIND GUSTING] Hmm? [SINGING IN RUSSIAN] [SINGING IN RUSSIAN] [IVAN SPEAKING] The sink. The toilet. And... ...the bed... ...which is either surprisingly comfortable... ...or I'm just really fucking tired. A lamp. A candle. Apparently, they lack confidence in their power supply. Well, you better hope not, 'cause if the lights go out, so does the heat. I think you'd like it here. I'm going bear hunting. Have you been drinking? Copiously. All work and no play, huh? I'm trapped. [EXHALING DEEPLY] Wanna see an old telephone? Send me a pic, okay? Let's talk later? [COMPUTER BEEPING] [SIGHING] [SIGHING] You're not a good man. [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR CLOSING] What is that? A gift. In case you've decided to hate me. To change your mind. A candle? It's the thought that counts. That's what we say in America. Do you? What? Hate me?

Better. So, today? Tonight? - Tomorrow? - Maybe tomorrow. I'll see you at 11. [DIALING] [PYOTR SPEAKING RUSSIAN ON VOICEMAIL] I'm flying back to St. Petersburg tomorrow. You better fucking be there. This is my new number. Call me. [RAILWAY CROSSING DINGING] [TRAIN WHISTLE SOUNDING] [MOANING] [PANTING HEAVILY] In Russia, we have these things we drink from. We call them glasses. Your parents? My father Sasha... ...mama Nina, Ivan... ...Maxim, my older sister Olga. Vladimir wasn't born yet. - This? - That's in Australia. My sister Olga, and this is her husband. They run a travel agency in Brisbane. I worked for them. That's how I learned English. And then? And then... ...my mother died. A stroke. Four weeks later, my father followed. Someone had to run the caf√©, so I came back. - But what about your brothers? - [SCOFFING] My father would've set fire to the place first. Same outcome, only quicker. Come. You could stay here longer if you wanted. I'm not asking you to. I'm just saying I would not object. I have a situation in St. Petersburg. I need to address it. Pyotr and your not-spying? You are in some sort of trouble, I think. In Russia... ...if we don't want to answer a question, we just ask one in return. Is... is it true what they say about Anton? What do they say about him? That he's a good man. Is your wife a good woman? Very much so. And yet, here you are. That's true. Here I am. You don't think this requires an explanation? My wife and I are old friends. And sometimes, with an old friend... ...you learn to squint away certain things... ...things you'd maybe rather not see. Is it just her doing this not-seeing or you too? The thing about squinting... ...you can never be certain what you might not be seeing. My... ...grandfather was in the Gulag. - You know about the Gulag? - Of course. He always said there were two types of prisoners. Some of them, you put them in a wooden hut... ...and you give them a flint... ...and they'll use the flint to try and light the stove... ...and they'll pass years like that. Night after night... ...striking the flint... ...trying only to keep from shivering. The others? You give them a flint... ...and they'll burn the hut down. You're saying my wife and I... ...we light the stove. Do you? I'm so sorry for the bird. [CHUCKLING] Where did you hear that? Your brothers. [CAR ENGINE STARTING] [BELLS TOLLING] - Oh. Back so soon, Mr. Hill? - Has Pyotr surfaced? But... a Mr. Volkov has been calling... ...three, four times a day. [BEEPING] [EXHALING DEEPLY] If I send a plane, will you come to St. Petersburg? KATYA: Do you imagine I'll say no to such a thing? It'll be at the airport tomorrow, before dawn. Is that too early? Of course not. - I need a favor. - Uh-huh. I see. Nothing comes for free. The candle I gave you... ...I need you to bring it. This isn't supposed to seem odd? I'll explain when you get here, I promise. So it is the candle you want and I am merely the one who brings it? Exactly. This is humor. American humor? I'm sorry. Come to St. Petersburg, Katya. I assure you, you'll see how much you're wanted. Okay? Okay. [SIGHING] - [BELLS TOLLING] - [PHONE RINGING] BORIS: You're cutting this close, Mr. Hill. The air in the room... it's almost gone. I need more time. But I have the sample. If you have a sample, I do believe you have everything. Unless you were having other conversations... ...with other parties. South Africans, for example. Let me take you out tomorrow night... ...you and your associates. A gesture of good faith. Nonsense. This is my city, and you are my guest. You'll bring the sample. Of course. 8 pm. You name the spot. Ten, Mr. Hill. This is St. Petersburg. Nothing of any use happens before ten. Rubinshteina Street, 151. I'll see you there? [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] - Hello? - Lucas, my friend... - ...you are just too easy to find. - Vincent. How can I help you? Tell your man to drive to the Lion's Bridge tomorrow at 9 am. We'll talk then. [LINE DISCONNECTING, PHONE BEEPING] [BELLS TOLLING] I apologize for this unfortunate bit of drama, Lucas. Sometimes it's better to meet face to face. You've watched too many spy films, Vincent. On the contrary. You've watched too few. Tell me you're not carrying a smartphone, 'cause even a thug like Volkov... ...can track your GPS with that thing. [SPEAKING AFRIKAANS] To what do I owe this pleasure? - I would like to repay a debt. - And what debt would that be? Lagos. There was no reason for you to contact me that evening. It was an act of generosity some might argue saved my life. Now, there's no reason for me to contact you. Keep going. Fuck, Lucas, you hold everything at a distance. You see it as a strength... ...but it can also be a weakness. I'm telling you, feel this. Go home, now... ...before it's too late. - ANDREI: Hello? - LUCAS: Is he fucking me over? - Who? - Your brother has vanished with my diamonds. Tell me why I shouldn't think he's fucking me over. Because he's Pyotr. The FSB is involved. Warn him if he calls. [EXHALING SHARPLY] Fuck. Can I see? - It's not real? - The best I've ever seen... ...but no... ...not real. And this is a problem, I assume? One of many. The same? Real. I've promised someone a dozen and I only have one... ...which is another of my problems. Tell me about the gun, please. - It's Pyotr's. - You found him? Is that all you have to say? Does your wife know you do this? Yes. What does she think about it? [SIGHING] She's used to it. [SNIFFING] This scent, what's the word for it in English? [SNIFFING] - Jasmine. - Jasmine. You should bring home some of them... ...for your wife. Do you bring her gifts... ...when you return from your travels? Not so much. Why? Do you think you're the gift? That she should be so happy to see you home? If you love someone... ...when you go away, you should bring them something. To show you carry them with you. You're a grown man. I should not need to tell you this. I want you to do something for me. Anything. Fuck me. Right now. Like you fuck your wife. [MOANING] Tell me you love me. - I love you, Gabby. - I love you, too. - Hey. - Don't stop. Don't stop. Keep fucking her. I want you to say her name when you come. Say it. [MOANING INTENSIFIES] Gabby. Gabby. [PANTING] How old are you? 51. All those years... ...and you still haven't learned how to embrace someone at a moment like this? I'm sorry, Katya. Your blue diamonds... ...do they never lose their color? "Diamond" comes from a Greek word. Adamas. It means "unalterable." Is that why you love them? I love them because they're beautiful... ...and rare... ...and tough. Not much of a talker, are you? I need to go out for a couple of hours. Will you be okay? But you flew me all the way out here to sit alone in your hotel room? I need to go appease a man. The man who is expecting the dozen diamonds but only receiving one. Where? I'll be back in a couple of hours. [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR CLOSING] [CAR HORNS HONKING] Lucas Hill. - [LAUGHING] - [GLASSES CLINKING] Hey. Now we can begin. Have you brought my blue beauty, this thing of wonder? Thank you. Welcome. Come on in. Let's do business. The rest is just as lovely? Then we will be friends for life. [DOOR OPENS] BORIS: Is that your lovely friend? It is. [SNIFFING] [RAP MUSIC PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND] [EXHALING] To life. [SNIFFING] To life. BORIS: I like this girl. Come. Come, man. To life, huh? [SNIFFING] Opa. In America... ...you swear loyalty by becoming... ...blood brothers, yes? Would you like to become my... ...my brother? Here's what I'd like to do. My lovely friend here? I tell her to suck you off. And at the same time, you tell your lovely friend to suck me off. We sit, staring at each other... ...until we come. After that... ...nothing can separate us. Huh? I'm touched by your gesture. But this is something, um... ...it's not how we do things in America. [LAUGHING] Thank God we're in Russia, man. Opa! What? She's, uh... ...not good enough for you? Quite the contrary. You have excellent taste. Then what is it? Your woman's mouth is too pretty for my cock? Not at all. I just think... ...Boris, Boris. - Lena? - Mm-hmm. Tell me to suck his cock. BORIS: I think it's... ...better if we leave here as brothers. Because if we're not brothers... ...maybe we're not friends, either. Do it. [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [DOOR OPENING] Messages? Your room number, sir? 701. [WHISPERING] They're upstairs. Thank you. Polozin, FSB. I'm going to be direct. I hope you'll respond in kind. The FSB has no interest in you, Mr. Hill. In fact, we'd like to see you leave the country as soon as possible. But first, we hope you will provide a small service. What kind of service? We recently took a man named Yuri Samsonov into custody. Mr. Samsonov had in his possession a number of quite beautiful blue diamonds. Beautiful but worthless, as it turned out. Perhaps you're not so surprised to hear this. I'd like to speak with my embassy, if you don't mind. We should keep talking, no? Someone, apparently, has taken it into his head... ...to inconvenience Mr. Volkov. My job is to be the inconvenience. But to accomplish this, unfortunately I need your assistance. It would be helpful to us if you would vouch for the quality... ...of poor Mr. Samsonov's fake diamonds. Meaning? What do you suppose might happen if someone with your unquestionable expertise... ...were to convince Mr. Boris Volkov... ...to buy these diamonds of ours? You know what would happen to me if I do this. Mr. Volkov would be rather unhappy. Which would give me what? - A day? - Two, maybe three. Enough time to leave the country. I assume you have a reason why I shouldn't tell you to fuck off. - Indeed. - Now might be the time to share it. When you tell us to fuck off... ...what do you think happens to her? Ah. Perhaps you don't care. Mr. Hill? How much did Samsonov pay? 40 million. Your partner, he's quite the salesman. I'm hoping you're as skilled. Here's a transmitter. Not that we don't trust you, of course. Your lapel, please. Thank you. Good. Say something. - Fuck off. - [LAUGHING] Okay, and this... ...is for the wire transfer. He'll be bringing his appraiser with him. Will that be a problem for you? Depends on whether he comes with a spectrometer. - Did he bring it last time? - I didn't see one. Then it should not be a problem. Thank you, Mr. Hill. [BUZZER SOUNDING] [LONG BUZZER BLAST SOUNDING] Please. Just a quick kick of the tires, that's all. Of course. You know what happens if something is wrong? You and I, we go for a walk together. What's his problem? Pavel, shut the fuck up. My apology, brother. In America, it's a weighty term. Don't be like that. Please. Let's have a drink, kid. - Please. - I don't have time. - I have a flight to catch. - BORIS: Brother... ...Lucas, look at me. Huh? No. No. These diamonds are good? As good as you'll ever see, Boris. [SIGHING] The account? [DEVICE BEEPING] BORIS: Done? Done. MAN: You should have been an actor, Mr. Hill. We're sending you home. [DEVICE CHIMING] [PHONE BUTTONS BEEPING] - I need a favor, Vincent. - Ah, you see? We are friends. You contact Boris Volkov. You offer him $65 million for the blues... ...then make excuses to delay the transaction. Fuck that. I'm not paying that savage 65 million anything. I didn't say "pay." I said, "offer and delay." 24 hours, and you can stop answering his calls. I'll wire you $100K for your trouble. Listen. If the goal is to cause Volkov difficulty and to buy you time... ...I'll do it now, I'll do it for free. Thank you, Vincent. You are a terrible man, but an excellent friend. I imagine you know this already, but if you've ripped this man off... ...he will kill you on principle. [BEEPING PHONE OFF] [PHONE BUTTONS BEEPING] [PHONE RINGING] [ON VOICEMAIL] You've reached the voicemail of Gabby Hill. - After the beep, leave me a message. Thanks. - [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPING] [BEEPING PHONE OFF] [DOG BARKING] [DOOR OPENING] Hate me yet? I'll be right back. [DOOR CLOSING] Fucking Pyotr. [BIRD CHIRPING] Lucas, are you okay? I just talked to Andrei... ...the man from the mine. - Pyotr's brother? - Yeah. Pyotr, he's coming back here. With the diamonds? Yeah. - I'll stay with you. - No, it's okay. I'll see you later at home. Tomorrow morning, I'll be making you French toast. And you'll be fine? Yes. Then I'll see you and your diamonds and my breakfast in the morning. Good luck.
