I wanna get out of here. Steph, that's your apartment. I don't even care. Cassie? Cassie? There's a car here. Is there anyone else out there? Somebody broke the window. Cassie, you should just call the cops. Cassie! Stephanie! Cassie! What's up, Cookies? It is Rookie Cookie and we are on Day 17 of my 30 day work out challenge. Hey, Caleb here. People ask me all the time what type of supplements I take. I just wanted to show you a quick and easy ab workout. I want to share with you a very unique exercise. Chin up right into a muscle up. Well, as you can see right now, I'm getting ready and I'm going on a date. This really cute guy, Caleb, asked me out. Yesterday's date was pretty awesome. Brooke is really fun and I'm... Babe, it's time to wake up. I got some coffee. I got coffee. There we go. It's hot. What's the matter? Why are you so camera shy? Because I don't have any make up on. Come on. Just sip some coffee. All right. I'm going to have to put this camera down. It's time to wake up. It's time to wake up. What time is it? It's time to wake up. I think you know what time it is. Wake up. Oh! No way! That's so not right. Hey, guys! Brooke and Caleb here. We're just about all packed up. Pretty excited. We have about a four hour drive ahead of us. Babe, I want to make sure I don't forget anything. We've got the tent, cooler, chairs, yoga mat, you've got the camera. Do you have extra batteries? No. And there goes my boyfriend. Always forgetting things. But yeah, pretty excited. It's my first time camping. As you all know, it's our one year anniversary. So gonna... Oh! Hey, Pete. Hey. You scared me. You guys going somewhere? Yeah, we're about to go camping for the weekend actually. We're just finishing packing up. About to leave... That's cool. ...here in a minute. That's cool. Yeah. You want me to watch your place while you're gone? No, I think we'll be OK. But thank you. What's with the... Oh, yeah. I'm just finishing one of our video blogs. You know. Oh, yeah. You guys post them on the internet, right? Yeah. That's cool. Would you like to be in one? I'm just about to kind of... Oh, yeah. No. That'd be cool. Hey, what's up? I'm Pete. I'm the neighbor. It's Pete. If you've got a problem with this girl, you've got to come see me 'cause I'll sort you out. He's got it for a while. He's a pretty nice guy. So... Yup. ...just wanted to say hi to everyone. I want to give a shout out. I just started selling cars at my uncle's dealership, so if you... We better get going, guys. Hey. Hey, Pete. What's up. Hey. Hey, man. Have fun on your camping trip. Thanks! What's the matter? You couldn't afford a hotel. Yeah. No, no. Hey, thanks for watching. Cool, man. Let's hang out sometime. Oh, you betcha. Oh, my god. Why do you talk to him? He walked up to me. What do you expect? Just ignore him. Yeah. The guy's... I can't just ignore him. Freaking everywhere. He's a person. He's a nice guy. He offered to... Oh, my god, bro. That's frickin' weird. He's just curious. I'm not even looking at him. I don't care. Oh, OK. That's bizarre. He's really nice. God, I frickin' waved to him. Be nice. He's really nice. Why did I do that? Oh, damn it. His creepiness rubbed off on me. OK, don't let it ruin... Yup. It's a new day. Here we go. I'll bet that you know that. I want to be in your arms so bad. Where you at? Baby, can you come over? I'm waitin' and beggin', we want to lose control and you're fakin' you're gazin' this fairytale you know it. With your hands, wave them high. Put your lines in the sky. We shoot higher and higher. We're shooting stars, we're shooting stars. With your hands, wave them high. Put your lines in the sky. We shoot higher and higher. We're shooting stars, we're shooting stars. With your hands, wave them high. Put your lines in the sky. We shoot higher and higher. We're shooting stars, we're shooting stars. We're shooting stars, we're shooting stars. We're shooting stars, we're shooting stars. You don't even realize the amount of skill that it takes to ride on these country roads. Speaking of country roads, I want to share a little something with you. Oh, look. A phone pole. Country roads... Yeah, stop singing. ...take me home to the place... Hey, isn't it good that we kind of saw him... stop. When would you like to possibly settle down? Oh, I haven't thought about that. I honestly... I don't know. That idea kind of freaks me out a little bit. You just, you asked if we could buy that house back there in the middle of nowhere. Oh. Why would somebody want to buy a house in the middle of nowhere if they didn't want to settle down and have kids? Rent it out? Make money off it? Make money. All right, that sounded like a settled down type topic from here. I think... But do you want kids? I think you're looking way too much into it. So my boyfriend is going to make me eat gas station food. Yeah, but you had to go pee. Well, I had to go to the bathroom. So we killed two birds with one stone, right? Yeah. I don't know about the food here though. Yeah, but we're in the middle of nowhere here, so. Yeah. Well, what are my healthy options? Well, like, I don't know, fried chicken and french fries? You want me to eat that? Really? Yeah. Well, I mean, you can throw it up afterward if you want. Are you trying to make me gain weight? Yup. Really? No. I... no. Look at that. That's disgusting. It's not even real food. You want some? No. No, I don't want any of that. Not if you want clogged arteries. Hey. You're gonna die at the age of 50. You're missing out. It tastes awesome. No. Sometimes you've got to live a little. No. That's not my type of food. I'll meet you outside. I've got to fill the car up with gas. OK. Ugh. Hey, I can't really talk right now. Yeah, I'm with him. It's our one year anniversary. What do you expect? I'm not just going to not do something with him for our one year anniversary. Like, he would suspect something. OK, look, I really can't discuss this right now. But, like, when I get back in the city after the weekend, I'll call you and we'll talk about it, OK? No, I promise I'll call you. OK. I love you too. All right. Bye. Hey, guys. Just checking in here. Want to give you a quick update. We are at a truck stop. Brooke is inside, and we are going to make this very special because I'm planning on popping the big question on this trip and I want to share this experience with you because you guys have seen us from the very beginning. So I think you'll agree with me that she is definitely the one I should spend the rest of my life with. So she's going to film a yoga video and I'm going to set everything up and film this whole experience. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous, but it's definitely going to be something that she'll never forget. She's coming right now. So we have about an hour left on our trip. So Brooke... Can we please go? ...so Brooke, why don't you tell us what... Turn it off. Please, can we go? What? Whoa. What's the big deal? Caleb, please drive. Why? This creepy guy just walked up to me. We're in the middle of nowhere. What? He knew who I was. I just, I don't know. I'm just... can we please get out of here? Wait, hold on. I really don't want to be here. Hold on. Slow down. What do you mean a creepy guy? Oh my god. Do you know this guy? No. Is this the creepy guy you were... hey, what's up? Brooke? Yeah? You forgot your wallet. Y'all going camping? Yeah. Caleb, please just drive. Can we go? You're welcome. Please turn the camera off. Seriously. Caleb! OK. So a little bit of a video update. We are 30, 40 minutes away? About 35. 35 minutes away. Literally in the middle of nowhere. It's beautiful. And we have no service at all. We are off the grid officially, which is what we wanted, honey. Yeah. No service to do anything. What the hell? What? There's a guy riding our ass. What? What the hell is this? Caleb! Roll your window up! That's the guy from the truck stop! What the... Why do you have your window down! Pull over! God! Why did you even roll your window down? I don't know! He just pulled beside. I thought he was passing. Oh my god. All right. Well, look, they're clearly moving on, so let's just wait here for a second. What is your favorite baby name? I haven't even thought about that yet. Why? Really? What, have you? Yeah. I think either Caleb the second or Casey. But Cs. I like Cs. Casey for a boy? Isn't that a girl's name? No, it can be both. Boy or girl. OK, we're finally here. Can't get too excited. It's 15 miles an hour. I really hope this is a new one. It's going to take us an hour to get them... to get there. I can't even speak I'm so excited. Oh, look. Other people are here. It's not just us. No, we're going way out in the middle of nowhere. So we're going where nobody is. Oh, no. But everyone's back there. Woo! Now we're here. Here we go. Primitive camping right there. Primitive camping? Mhm. That means no bathrooms. Most importantly, no internet. Just you and me. What about Wi-Fi? I mean, not Wi-Fi, but... No. No Wi-Fi. 3G? Anything? No. Anything? Come on. Oh my god. Looks miserable. You always this slow? You didn't say anything about alligators. Come on. Uh-uh. Nope. You're not going to see any alligators. And you know this for a fact? Yup. I'm not walking across that. I don't see one gator. There has to be a way around. No. Not one gator here. Not doing it. Uh-uh. This is freaky. Caleb, seriously. I'm not comfortable knowing that I could get eaten in my sleep. You don't have anything to worry about. My parents are going to kill you. Ugh! There's mosquitoes everywhere, Caleb! Yeah. Surprised. Yeah, but you don't have to worry about snakes, right? I swear to God, if there's a snake, I'm kicking him towards you. Stop it. I'm really actually scared that there's a snake somewhere. I'm looking at something pretty cute on my screen right here. There you go. Me? Yes. Isn't this cool? I mean, there's not one other person out here. I don't know how I feel about that. I don't think you look afraid. I think deep down inside you'll appreciate this. I'm terrified. Well, you're doing good so far. Well, we've only been walking for what, 10 minutes? A little longer than that. So you know what? That means that time is flying. I think you enjoy this. Hey, so we've been walking like 15 miles so far. How far have we been walking? Two miles. Are we almost there yet? No, seriously though. Like, I'm tired. Like, how is this supposed to be a good anniversary thing if... It is, we're... hey, look, we're almost there. OK? Like, how far though? We got... Seriously, this bag is heavy. We just have a little bit further to go. I'm carrying a lot of stuff. Yeah, but look, Miss Fish Chick, I mean, this is just a three mile hike. Fish. You're trying to make fun of me... I said Fit Chick. You're trying to make fun of me because you know I'm aggravated right now. Well, because you're complaining about being so tired. Well, I am. Look, I'm carrying most of this stuff. Well, this was your idea. Yeah, but I'm not complaining. Well, you've probably done this before. I haven't. Trust me, we've just got a little further and it's... I would just think that on my first hike ever we wouldn't go 15 miles into the middle of nowhere. 15 miles? We've gone two miles. Two miles, and we're almost there. Are you really tracking this? Like, exactly two miles. Yes. Yes, I am. All right. Let's get going. No more complaining. This is going to be fun. Why am I dating you? Hey, this is it. Wait, really? Uh-huh. Yeah, 20 miles later. 20 miles. Can I actually take all this stuff off? Like this it, this is it? Yeah. All right. Well, I guess you better start building that tent. Move your foot. No way. Should I get... Why is that so bright? Turn the camera away. Well, it's a special occasion. Why? For what? What do you mean what? Camping? My first time camping? No, it's our anniversary. Oh, yeah. And I've got something special. More wine? No, something better. Here. Hold the camera. I can't see a thing. It's way too bright. Champagne! Yes. Yay! I'm excited! Does this make you happy? Uh, yeah! All right. Wait, can we take a picture before you pop it? OK. All right. OK. Hold on. I don't know. You have longer hands. OK. I'll hold it. Sure. OK. Can you get the bottle in it? Yeah. Let's get it in here. OK. Ready? Kiss. Did you take a picture? Oh, no. Hold on. Let's do it again. OK. You suck. OK. Pop it. I want to see it. All right. Hold this. Yeah. Here we go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me actually see that. How would you like me to pop it? Pop, lock, and drop it? That's not sexy at all. All right. Don't mess up. Don't mess up? If you're lucky, you'll hit an animal with the cork and... I know. ...feed us for, like, a week. All right. The camera's kind of heavy. All right, here we go. I'm getting impatient. I know. OK, sorry. I've got to try to make it straight. I'm trying to find the wire. I don't know how to zoom on this thing. Are you ready for this? Yeah. I'm excited! Hey. Take a swig! Chug it! That's great. I took a swig of the bubbles! OK. Round two. You can edit that, right? No, it's totally going on my blog. I think it's your turn. I'm glad you love me for who I am. Yeah. OK. Watch a professional. OK. That's hot. Here, just hold that right there. See? I'm not the only one. OK. No. Stop laughing. No, do a little dance. Do a little dance. OK, but this can only be, like, our video. This is our video. Who else do you think is out here? I'm just saying you can't post this on anything. I will not post this. Oh, I love this song. OK. I'm going to do a little dance for you though. Only you. OK. OK? OK. You are awesome. I don't think I can get any lower because the champagne is making me. How did you get to be such a good dancer? I don't know. I didn't know you could dance like that. Now this a little bit. That's my girl. Are you done with it? I didn't drink it all by myself. It was all you too. I only had a sip or two. That was it. You know what? What? I think we should. All right. Let's go. Oh my gosh. What is this? I don't know. I think my feet got a little dirty. It's about to get dirty. You're talking about the tent, right? Yes. Oh, it's so bright, Caleb. What? Why is the camera on? This It's not. Yeah, I can see the light. It's a red flash. Turn it off, Caleb. Well, you film everything else, right? Not this! This is private. Yeah, but this is private. You taste like bug spray. No, really though, turn it off. Turn it off! All right. I'm tired. Hey, where are you going? I've got to pee. Hurry up. I want to cuddle. For all you guys out there who follow my girlfriend back there, it's been a year and it's still pretty awesome. And that is a goodnight. I was just asleep and... did you hear that? That! That was... Caleb! Caleb! Caleb! Yeah? Wake up! Yeah? Shh. Listen. Listen, listen, listen. Someone's outside. No one's outside. Shh! Just listen! I heard someone walking. There's no one out there. Just listen! Will you go check? Please? Like, I'm not kidding. I heard... someone was walking. I heard footsteps. Please? Be careful. I'll be back. Caleb? Caleb! Oh my... Oh my god! I hate you. Did I get you? Did you... are you kidding me? That's what you get for waking me up. That was good. You almost gave me a heart attack. That was not funny. Seriously, I hate you so... You can turn the camera off now. I hate you so much. I love you too. Goodnight. Oh, goodnight. Well, good afternoon. It's about 12:30. It was a little crazy last night, but right now we're up, Brooke's doing a yoga video, and it gives me the perfect opportunity to do what I came here to do. Hey, everyone. Brooke here. Today I'm going to show you my favorite yoga pose. It's called the side plank. And since we're out here in the beautiful mother nature, I thought I'd do it right here by this gorgeous lake. So first thing you're going to do, you're going to get down into your chaturanga pose. Make sure to breathe nice and slow. This is going to be our starting point. Then you're going to slowly work your way into your normal plank. Now, remember to really squeeze your core. This is a big core exercise and you want... not your booty in the air, but just level. The next thing you're going to do, you're going to go to your hands and you're just going to go sideways. Be sure to breathe nice and slow. This is engaging in all your core. Good. And then you're going to turn and you're going to go to the other side. Ready? Go up. Make sure to do it nice and slow. Really breathe and really engage in your whole core area. It's so beautiful out here. All right. I think I've got this all figured out. Brooke gets back from yoga, then I'm going to propose to her right here. And god, I'm nervous. But all I know is that I love her and I want to spend... I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just hope that she says yes. Whoa! Caleb! Whoa! Get on the ground! OK! OK, OK! Stay down! What do you want? What do you want, man? Shut up! Just don't hurt us! Put those on! Just do what he says! Now! Just do what he says! All right, all right! OK, OK! I got it! Behind you! What are you... come on, man! Please don't hurt him! What you want, man? Please... Shut up! Oh! Caleb! Brooke, you OK? Everything's going to be OK! No, it's not! My name is Nick and this is Jake, and we're making a documentary about how easy it is to track people through social media. And kill them. But not really. We're trying to show how dangerous this could be. Yeah. What we're doing here is we want to show everyone that people are kind of free with the information they put online these days. So we want to get that information and really take advantage of it. So what we did is we found a YouTube celebrity couple online that frequently blogs about their personal lives. I tracked them down through their social media accounts and they're going to be our target couple. So we're going to track them down, give them a big scare, and hopefully we'll shed some light on this subject. Yeah, we want to really show everybody just how dangerous this all is. I'll give that dangerous line. That was good. Freaked me out. OK. Do we need to do it again or... No, we're good. We're good. Let's cut this. All right. OK. So the person that we have as our target is actually someone that I've actually been following for the last few months, and her name is Brooke Marie and she's got a sizable audience online. She's a fitness blogger, a yoga enthusiast, and a YouTube personality. And I think it's going to be incredible when we actually meet her and her boyfriend Caleb. And it's going to be great because they got a sizable audience and exposure for us and for them. Hey, man. This is good. We're making cinematic history here. The point is we found her online. It was really easy. We actually sent her a friend request, she accepted it. What's another subscriber to her, right? But to us, we've got some critical pieces of information online including where she is currently living. And even better, she linked it to her Instagram account, and on her Instagram account at the top is a bookings email address for all of her booking stuff. Jake, what's up? Booking stuff? What does she book? Well, I mean, she's a brand ambassador. She books for a lot of stuff. That's how YouTube people make money. What does she actually do though? Does she should do anything? Is it like a trade or a skill? You know, just the point is though, is that we have her stuff. We have her contact information and we're going to reach out to her and see if we can get her real address. So that's where we're at. I can't wait to meet her. Camera's rolling? Yeah. OK. Good. So over the last couple of days, we've been emailing Brooke as a guy named... You know what you're going to say, right? Yeah. I got it. We've been emailing Brooke as a guy named Tim from a Green Tree Supplements company and we managed to get her phone number. And now we're going to call her and see if we can get her address. So here we go. Hey, is this Brooke? Hey, it's Tim from the Green Tree Supplement company. How are you? Good. Good, good, good, good. We were wondering if we can send you that sample. What do you think? Well, sure. Basically how it works is that it's a natural green tea extract that is a fat burner combo'd with energy boosting that you could put in, like, anything... shakes, smoothies, water... and it tastes delicious. And we were trying to market this to the fitness community and we though you'd be perfect for it. Sure. Basically how this would work is that at first we would send you a sample. And if you liked it, we could send you a shipment and you could, I don't know, incorporate it into your fitness routine and we could talk about sponsoring your channel. OK. That's great. Basically the next step would be to get your address. OK. Just give me one moment. Whenever you're ready. OK. Just a moment. What? Yes, I'm sorry. One moment. I'm sorry. And whenever you're ready. OK. Just, oh, yeah. OK. And that was apartment... sure. And that's... OK. OK. OK. Great! So what we can do next is we'll send you a shipment, and expect something in four to six days. Great. Thanks, Brooke. Bye. We got it. We got it! This is her address. Let's go see Brooke and Caleb. Let's go! OK. All right. They're livin' the condo life. Caleb and Brooke in a condo. That has a nice ring to it. The gate's closing. Aw, the gate's closed? Well, what the heck are we supposed to do now? Hold on. Just wait. Wow. Oh, this guy is definitely looking at us. And that's that security right there. Oh my god. He didn't even bat an eye. And that's the condo security. Wow. And we're in. Open sesame. Access granted. Death vlog on the roll. Death vlog. Da na na na na na na na death vlog. OK. All right. Where are we going? OK. So we're looking... so we got into the apartment complex. We got their address. So we're pretty close. What building number is that that we just passed? That was building 22. So they've got to be around here somewhere. I know it. And look how easy it is to find someone like this. It's crazy. They're going to freak out when they see this at the end. Like, just a day. Just a day of stuff. That's him. Oh my god. That's him! Oh my god. That's him! That's him. That's him. Oh my god. That was him. Turn around. Turn around. People are so stupid. Really stupid. Oh my god. Go back over there. Drive past him. Drive past him again. This is awesome. I'm going to park up here. OK. Oh my god. Yeah. That's definitely him. That's definitely him. All right. Pull up. Oh, there she is. There she is. Yup. She's in the car. OK. All right. I'm going to park. I'll keep an eye out. I want you to get out. Get out? What, are you crazy? Yeah. Get out. Use cars for cover. She's... they're going to see us. Get footage of them. They're going to blow the whole cover. She doesn't know who we are. I have a camera in my hand. You don't think that that's a little weird and people are going to freak out? And? You think that she's going to find it weird when they film every single thing they do. It's going to be weird that you have a camera? Get out and film, dude. I really don't know about that, man. I really, really don't. Nick, get out of the car. OK. You'll be happy you did later. Dude, the documentary. I don't know, man. I really don't feel comfortable. Get out of the car. All right. I'm going. This guy. This is so stupid. Dude, shut up. We're going to get caught. Get closer. Oh my god. Oh my god. This is so close. I feel creepy right now. Shit. Where are you going? Did she see me? Why did you run? No, no, no. They almost saw me. I think they saw me. Are you still filming? This whole thing is... yes. Well, you did something right. Jesus. That was really freaking awesome. You want to shoo the documentary? Yeah. It's all about taking risks. I know. That was just a little... that was really close. Zoom in from a distance. No one wants to watch that. All right. 40 feet away from them. They're leaving. They're leaving. All right. We're going to follow? Lay low. There they go. That was really risky. Shut up. Let's take our time with it. Let's progress through it. Here. Thank you. Yeah. Definitely. This is going to be awesome. I think so. I think we're on to something here. I mean, that was close. I don't... Well, we've got to take risks. That was us meeting them in the flesh... All I ask... ...for the first time. All I ask, dude, is that you trust me. OK. This is going to be big. We're going to make changes, man. We're going to change things. I'm sweating. Oh my gosh. Where'd they go? What if we would have had the cops called on us? Like here, right now. That was weird. What are they going to do? Check our camera? The whole thing would have been blown. That would have been the end of the project. Yeah. I don't know about all that. Team death vlog. Here we are. And there is Caleb and Brooke. They seem really happy together. This doesn't seem like a usual place they would eat. No. No, they definitely seem like spinach, kale farm to table, organic people. Let's go inside. You want to go in? Yeah. Get a closer shot. Well, hello, Brooke. All by herself. I've got an idea. What's that? I'm going to go talk to her. What? No. No, you're definitely not going to do that. Just whatever you do... Wait, no. No. Whatever you do, do not stop filming. Look, someone just called her. Someone just called her. It's our one year anniversary. What do you expect? I just can't, like, not go. Huh. OK. Look, I know you've got this idea about going out there, but no. Not right now. There's a moment for that. We're not going to do that right now. OK. I'll call you when I get back. Jake, I'm serious. I love you too. Trust me. Just trust me. This is going to be amazing footage. Jake... Jake, oh my god. Brooke? Hi. My name's Jake. It's so nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Jake. I've seen, like, every video you've posted. I'm one of your 200 some odd thousand followers. Do you mind if I get a picture? Sure. OK. Just one. By the way, you look fantastic on camera. Thanks. I really... I'm sorry. I've really got to go. Oh my gosh. You've got to be kidding. Thank you so much. Yeah. See you around. You've got to be kidding. You took a picture with her? Jake, are you serious? Dude. Ma'am! Now that was interesting. No. People will watch that. I can't believe you got that close to them, man. That was... you've got some big cajones, man. But we did it. That's great. For the film. For the movie, that was good. I just can't see past this truck. I know. We are getting out to the country right now. Wow. Look at this. Look at this slack jawed Yoga on the back... Whoa! Whoa, what is this guy doing? Dude, this guy's a nutcase! What is going on here? This is really... Dude, she's... What a jerk! They're going to run them off the road. Oh my gosh! Oh, no, no, no. He just ran off the road. Oh my gosh. Oh, you redneck douche bags. What do we do? What do we do? I don't know. Just keep your distance. Keep your distance. I'm going to pull over. OK. Pull over. Pull over. We'll find a rest stop. We'll find something. We can't go back right now. That's a little too weird. That was weird, man. We are traveling into the filmmaking abyss! That's amazing. This is going to be good! This is going to be great. We can be... hey, documentaries, they flow naturally with what you're getting. I think we're on to something big here. That's good. That's exciting. That was nuts. We lost them. It was those jerks in the pickup truck. What the heck was that all about? It's all right. I mean, we know the campground that they're going to. We know where they're going to be. Yeah. Now that these guys scare the crap out of them, they cancel the whole trip. I mean... No, I know Brooke. She's... we've seen her videos. She's going to go through with this. No. Nope. Nothing. All right. No, they're not down there. I didn't see any cars. Here we go. No, that's not them. That's not them. You got any service? I've gotten no service out here at all. You know I hate camping? It's not so bad. Bugs, snakes, weird shit crawling all over you. I don't know. Did you have a bad experience? Well, yeah. I mean, I went camping a grand total of one time. One time. And I was eight years old. I went camping with my family. And we were at lunch and I was eating a hot dog and a snake from above, a small snake, fell on my hot dog while I was eating it. And that just like freaks you out, obviously, as a kid. Freaked me out so much my mom took me home and we spent the whole weekend watching HBO while the rest of the family camped. Been an indoorsy guy ever since. Know what I mean? I used to go camping with my father. I didn't always want to go when I was younger, but he insisted. My dad was an interesting guy. Had a weird way of teaching me lessons. A couple times we'd go out to the woods and the first day, two days would be fun. I'd wake up in the morning and he would be gone, and I had to find my way around by myself. Oh, here we go. Is that it? That's it. OK. Go Easy. They might be here. Might be around here somewhere. Hold on. Just... I think they're like deeper into the woods. I think we're OK. OK. Just be quiet. Shh. Is there anything in there? No. I mean, they've got to be around here somewhere. Let's go in there. Let's go in. OK. Grab your bag in case we have to stay out there overnight. Overnight? Yeah. All right. OK. I really wasn't thinking we'd do that, but OK. Team death vlog going into the forest for the hunt. I mean, are we... I mean, is this even the right direction? I'm not really sure. We're going here. Primitive camping. Well, why? Well, think about who we're following. Caleb's kind of an extreme guy. Extreme sports. He's going to want to be alone with her. No interruptions, right? She would hate that. So she'd want to stay close. Well, where are we? We're over here. OK. So we're... so this is essentially... OK. So this is essentially a fork in the road. We're either going to walk 1.1 miles and not find anybody or walk 3.4 miles and possibly not find anybody. Don't walk much, huh? You got any better ideas? Yeah. Actually, I do have a better idea. We use technology. Check it out! Here we go. Yes. And see, now we can scan the entire roadway. Almost. This is perfect. The longer we play with this, the further they get away. We got it. Hold on. Oh, shoot. It just disconnected on me. Oh, come on! There's your technology for you. Jake, come on, man. This is important. This is a very important gift to me. All right. I lost it. Wait, no! I found it! No, it crashed. We crashed it. Well, I think we should go find it at least. Forget the drone! Well, it's an expensive gift, Jake. All right? Let's find them! Jake, it's... How about that? The reason we're here. All right. OK. We are deep into the woods right now. And, I mean, we're trying to find Caleb and Brooke. Watch your step. I don't know. I just... I feel like we're exposed to the elements right now. You know, this is not exactly what I signed up for, Jake. I think we should just call it a night, find the trail, let's get out of here. I'm serious, Jake. Let's get out of here. It's starting to get a little too much right now. I'm pretty sure my mom is calling me. I don't even have service out here. I'm pretty sure my mom's left me a ton of voicemails. Your mom? Your mother. How old are you again? 31. Here we are hunting for Caleb and Brooke. So hungry right now. Come on! Jake, come on! Wait up, man! All right. Well, now which way do we go? Left? Oh, OK. Hey, Jake. Seriously. Jake. No, seriously. I need to go to the bathroom, man. Can you hold this? Jake, I need to go to the bathroom, man. Can you hold this camera? Yeah. Can you hold it? Thank you, man. Oh. Oh, god. Oh. Would you shut up? I needed that, man. OK. We're good. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What? What happened? What did you see? I swore I just saw a frickin' black widow spider, man. Oh my god. You saw a black widow from that... Oh my god, dude. That freaked me out. Dude, spiders. Me and spiders, no, man. That is where I'm drawing the line. It's not funny, Jake! It's not funny, man! Those things can kill you. Man. Oh. Do me a favor. Yeah? Put your hand in your pocket. You feel anything hanging between your legs? Look, man. Everyone's got phobias. Jake, man, I'm hungry, I'm tired. Forget it, man. We're just not going to find them tonight. I'd rather just be at home, man. Don't you just want to feel the comfort of your bed? Air conditioning. When we find Brooke, you better hope she's a lesbian because the things you're saying right now are extremely feminine. It's enough. Stop running your gap, dude. God. Well, Brooke likes sensitive guys, Jake. Maybe that's something you could learn, OK? You know what I'm sensitive to, Nick? You know what I'm sensitive to? All right, Jake. Take it easy, man. You running your mouth over, and over, and over. Jake... I can't hear a thing! Jake! Easy, man! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Look... Why are we out here? We're here to make a movie. All right. Now, do you actually believe that? Well, yeah. Yeah, man, but I'm just... Then whey are you laying on your back? Get up. Jake... You could use the exercise. People come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, all right? Yeah. OK. Where are we right now? What are you hearing? I heard voices. All I can hear is mosquitoes buzzing by my ear. We cant hear anything if you keep talking. I'm sorry. All right. Come on. OK. Use the tree. Come here. That's them! You're standing in the open! Come here! Yup. That's them. We found them. Wow. We've got to turn around. Go back. Come back out here when it's dark. OK. Can we go find my drone now then? All right. It's 3 AM. We're outside Brooke and Caleb's campsite. This is crazy. All right. I want you to get in closer, all right? Get in closer, get in the tent, and get a shot of them sleeping. No, no, no, no. That's too crazy. No one's ever done this before. If you ever had to get a shot, it's this one. Come on. This will make the movie. All right. Good point. Holy shit. Turn the light off, turn the light off, turn the light off. Turn it off! Turn the light off! Oh my god, Caleb! So not funny! That was huge! Oh my god! That was huge! That was good. Tomorrow. So that's the end of day one of death vlog. It was a really tiring day, but we're getting some rest in our car tonight and we're getting pumped up for tomorrow's big reveal. I can't wait to surprise Brooke and Caleb and see the look on their faces, and I can't wait to meet Brooke. And I think after all this, we're all going to be really good friends. Team death vlog out. What we're doing here, is it really going to make a difference? Is anyone going to see this and be affected by it? Are you going to see this and make a change in your life? No. No, you're going to look up from your phone long enough to laugh about it with a friend, and then you're going to look right back down at your phone and see how many of your friends liked the same article. But that's as far as it goes because it didn't happen to you. You're not the one in danger. Not yet. And I'm tired of begging you to see it. So what I'm going to do, what I'm going to do tomorrow is I'm going to do something that's going to send a ripple through the psychosphere. I'm going to try and change the course of human evolution and show you that we're no longer transcending to the fusion of humans and technology, but rather descending into slaves for it because we eat, sleep, drink, breathe electronic validation. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, the juggernauts of the etherworld that feed our egomaniacal desires. We are prostitutes for likes. We're not our likes, we're not our followers, were not even our photos anymore. Nothing is gained from all of this. Nothing is accomplished. We don't gain anything except for maybe a few followers. A few strangers who we know nothing about who took an interest in the persona we have created. Followers that we didn't mind sharing or name, phone number, address with. The time for telling you that this is dangerous and no good, that time has passed. Now it's time to show you because no one pays attention until someone gets hurt. All right. Today is day two of death vlog. Today's the big reveal. All right. Today is day two of death vlog. Today's the big reveal. I can't wait. I'm excited. My buddy in crime, Jake, you're the man. How do you feel? Good. Real good. I love it. He's excited as I am. He's ready for this. Today we are going to make cinematic history. All right, man. Jake, this is it. The big reveal. You ready for this? All right. Here. Put this on. What is this for? The hat? Well, because it's scary, man. This is scary? Yeah. They are going to freak out. All right. Let's do it. So the first thing you're going to do, you're going to get down and put on a pose. Oh my god. That's her. It's Brooke. You're going to slowly work your way to your normal plank. Now, remember to really.. God, she's beautiful. This is going to be amazing. Good. So you're going to turn. You're going to go to the other side. Ready? Make sure to do it nice and slow. What the hell? Really breathe and really engage in your whole core area. Jake, don't do it! Don't do it! It's so beautiful out here. Good, and then once you're done with that, you're going to make sure to go... oh my god! Shut up! Please don't hurt me! Wait, wait! Please don't hurt... Shut up! Caleb! Jake! Jake! Easy, man! Easy! Get up! Come here! It's OK. Everything is going to be OK! Please don't hurt me! Man, easy! Jake where did you get a gun? Jake, tell me it's not loaded, man! Tell me it's not loaded! Shut up! Please don't hurt me! Dude, where did you get a gun? Where did you get a gun, Jake? Caleb! Whoa! Get on the ground! OK! Stay down! What do you want? What do you want, man? Shut up! Put those on! Just do what he says! Now! Just do what he says! All right! OK! I got it. Behind you! Caleb! Please don't hurt him! What do you want, man? Please... Shut up! Caleb! It's OK! Everything's going to be OK! No, it's not! What the hell, Jake! Are you crazy? Do not! Do not tell them that everything's going to be OK! It is not going to be OK! They cannot keep doing what they're doing and expect to get away with it! To live the way they live. They cannot! What are we doing with this documentary, huh? We're going to finish it, we're going to put it online, it's going to get liked, it's going to get shared. We're going to be doing the same exact thing that they are. The same thing! It's just a cycle over, and over, and over. There must be consequences for it! There must be! With them, we could change everything. Wait, wait, wait! Wait! Brooke, wait! Get away from me! Wait! Listen! Brooke, I don't know! I don't know who those guys are! I have no idea what's going on! I swear I'm just a filmmaker. I was just documenting. This is not part of the plan! Who are you! I'm just a... my name's Nick. I'm a documentary filmmaker. We're doing a documentary about you. OK? But that sit back there, I have no idea what that is! You're a part of that! You have the mask! What the hell is this! It's just a documentary thing! I swear! We were doing it just to scare you. That was my buddy Jake that just died. But the girls and that shit, I don't know! I don't know what it is! I'm freaked out of my mind! OK? We just got to get the hell out of here! OK? We've got to go! I have no idea where I am! That guy died! I have no idea where we are! Caleb's back there! I just want to go! Where's Caleb? I don't know either, but we've got to get out of here. We've got to find some help, all right? Are you with me? Let's go! No, we can't leave Caleb! We have to help him! Are you crazy? We're not going back there! This is your fault! You have to help me! Look, it's not my... You have to help me! This is your fault! Brooke, Brooke... They killed your friend! What do you think they're going to do to Caleb? All right. But this is not a good idea, Brooke. You're helping me. All right. Let's be careful. Just take it slow. There. There's no one here. They're gone. Wait. Was that recording the whole time? Yeah, it's still recording. Oh my god. It's Caleb. ...get this all figured out. Brooke gets back from yoga, I'm going to propose to her right here. And god, I'm nervous. But all I know is that I love her and I want to spend... I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just hope that she says yes. He was going to... Caleb! Whoa! Whoa! Get on the ground! Caleb! OK! OK, OK! Stay down! What do you want? What do you want, man? Shut up! Just don't hurt her! All right, well, did they say which way they were going? Looks like they... I think it was that way. I think they went that way. All right, let's go. Let's go. Oh, wait. No, no, no. Brooke, Brooke, Brooke. Oh my god. That's not... Oh my god. That's not what I think it is, is it? I don't know. It could be Jake. I don't know. Caleb! All right, let's just follow the track. Let's just go, all right? Let's follow the track. We'll figure... oh my god. They could be anywhere. Oh my god. The trail, it gets... it kind of ends here. Do you know which way they went? No idea. They could have gone anywhere. Do you hear that? Hear what? My brothers and sisters, I have seen the heavens open and I've beheld the white horse. Holy shit. And upon it was a rider. And his name was faithful and true. And in his righteousness, he judges and he brings us to war. And his eyes fire with fiery glow, and his robe is dripped in blood. And in his mouth is a sword shaped tongue that cuts down the nation. And now, now he calls to me. Brooke! To lead his army. Brooke! Caleb! Well, well. Caleb! Another sinner has come seeking absolution. Caleb! Bring me the rod of iron! Shut up! Thank you, daughter. Caleb! You're next, but you've got to wait your turn! No! I hope we see you on the other side, brother. Caleb! Caleb! No! Oh my god. What the... Now, little lambs, are you ready to be forgiven? Sit still. No! Oh, shit! Oh, shit. Oh, god! Where am I? They're all dead. Caleb's dead. Jake's dead. Brooke's dead. I think I'm next. I gotta get out of here. And I have no idea where I am. What the hell was that? Nick, run! Run, run, run, run, run, run! Where am I? This isn't right. Where's my keys? Gotta get out of here. Brooke! What was that? Oh my god. Brooke! We gotta go. We gotta go. Thank god you're alive. Do you know the way out of here? Caleb had the keys. We have to go get Caleb. We can't go back there. You saw what happened. But Caleb had the keys. I got my keys. I've got my car. Let's go. Go, go, go. It's a good thing we've been recording all of this, Brooke, because this could all be evidence. Brooke, I'm serious. I need you to tell us what happened. I'm serious, Brooke. Can we talk about Caleb? Can we talk about it? Caleb's dead, Brooke. I'm serious. All right, fine. Let's talk about the guy you were talking to on the phone at the diner, huh? You want to talk about that? What are you talking about? The guy that you were on the phone with at the diner. You heard that? Yeah. Well, I didn't hear much. I heard that you loved him, and I know you weren't talking to Caleb. You know nothing, OK? Oh, all right. Well, now you want to talk. What, you think because you watch some videos that we post online that you know who we are? You don't know a thing! You don't know anything about me, about Caleb. I loved him, so don't make me out to be some kind of monster. I was going to break it off... Whoa! Holy shit! Oh! Nick, help me! Do something! Here! Turn it off. The car should be around here somewhere. Hey, Brooke. Brooke, I need every bit of you right now, all right? We're going to get out of here. Just a little bit further. Shh. Come here. Come, come, come. Shh. Run! Go! Run! Oh, god! Run! Go! Holy shit, that's the car! Go! Sinner! I just wanted to do one more post. I wanted to say goodbye to all my friends. Mom, dad, and most of all, my followers. I want to say thank you for all your support throughout the years. All your love, I've tried to be what you want me to be. Perfect hair, perfect body, perfect boyfriend. Truth is, I've had an eating disorder for the past five years and I cheated on my boyfriend. I'm a terrible person. I've been manipulating people my entire life, and it's all for the likes. A million followers is not worth it. It's not worth it. I don't know if this is going to get out to anybody, but the last thing I want to say is... Subtitles by explosiveskull
