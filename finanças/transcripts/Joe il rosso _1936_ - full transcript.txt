RED JOE The aristocratic Sandelle-Lafitte family is known throughout the world, as the owners of the famous painting by Murillo, "Moses Striking the Rock". For more than 2 centuries, this masterpiece by the Spanish master has been jealously guarded by the family. The painting, valued at several millions, has always been the main attraction for tourists visiting the region. Countess, forgive me, the tourists are coming. They'll want to see it. Shall we admit the theft? Never! Never! Nobody must know anything. Whatever the cost! Understand? But the tourists… - Tell them… whatever you like. Say that we're all sick in bed. Dying! Say there's scarlet fever in the house but no one must know the Murillo painting was stolen. Oh, dear cousin, this is terrible. And did that detective's investigation come to nothing? Unfortunately, no. What a disaster! The tourists are outside. Over there the Fine Arts Inspector is talking to my children about purchasing the painting! And it's not there. You'll pardon us for needlessly inconveniencing you, Inspector. But we couldn't foresee that our grandfather… would have a gout attack this very night. Right, this very night. I'm sorry. Absolutely impossible. But it's a disaster! You don't realize I have 50 people here. How do I send them away without showing them anything? In a very simple way: get in the car and set off again. No! One moment, just a peek. We won't disturb anyone. As my sister said, the selling of the painting is dear to us. I understand. I do. I will inform my superiors of the setback. Will you let me know when it'll be possible? - We shall. Perhaps the Minister of Fine Arts will come in person as well. Very sorry, ladies and gentlemen. Due to the owner's illness. Here is a photo of the painting. Returning home, you can still say you've seen Murillo's Moses. The famous Spanish painter, born in Seville, known all over the world! Who do you suspect? - No one. - How is that? In the Sandelle-Lafitte House, we are all above suspicion! But someone must have stolen this blessed painting. Someone not from this house. I ca…can't admit that among our re…relatives and guests… that there is a thief. I think he didn't really believe the story of the gout. We need to gain time and find the picture before the word gets out. Stefano, I've been looking for you! Sorry, dear, but there's been a lot of confusion this morning. This is not the time to be lovey-dovey. Come on, mama needs us. Because a picture was stolen I can't kiss my wife? Duke? - Yes? Sir, should the servants be made aware of what happened? Oh, no! But I must inform the Duke that the servants already know. As all the doors and windows on the ground floor were found locked from the inside, we must logically assume that the thief entered and exited through an upper floor window. Thanks to these modern habits of sleeping with windows o…open! Is there anyone who is in the habit of sleeping with the windows open? Me. Should I turn myself in? Turn yourself in? Why? Finally! Mr Champol from the Wolf Agency. The investigator I sent for on the Duchess's orders. A pleasure. Any news? Why does she have to turn herself in? Now then… Don't all talk together, by Jove! Would you please tell me what happened? I ventured on the hypothesis that the thief was able to enter and leave through one of the upstairs windows. And because I sleep with the bathroom window wide open and leave the door between the bathroom and the bedroom open, I asked if I should turn myself in! - Marta, how can you say that? I think what others make me think! But it can't be denied, dear Marta, that your habit of sleeping with the win… windows wide open in the country is rather bizarre. It's very hygienic, Duchess. - Very hygienic! I'm 62 and I'm ver… very well and I've always slept with the windows clo…closed. But in my house… - But you're in my house. Excuse me. - That's no reason to suffocate! Nor is it a good reason to give thieves free access! Mom, you don't think that… I'm truly sorry, I… Stop! I'm assuming nothing, my son. I only know that all the presidents of the Republic have come to our castle to contemplate the Moses. I know that we are known as the Sandelle-Lafitte of Murillo's Moses! And I find it even inco…inconceivable that a Sandelle-Lafitte, knowing he had such a treasure, would allow himself to sleep with the windows wide o… o… open! Marta? Marta? Sorry, Mom. Continue your investigations, Mr Champol. Forgive me, Mme Duchess, what if we called a specialized agent? I already told you that a regular police inspector would le… lead to the intrusion of journalists and then sca… scandal. Better a mediocre investigator than a certain scandal. You must excuse mama. You know the picture's disappearance is a great trouble. And ironically, the Ministry of Fine Arts, who always hesitated about buying the painting, now is willing to pay 7 million. 7 million! Allowing us to keep it at the castle until grandfather dies, you see. I can't find the painting or make your grandfather die! Are you crazy? It's obvious your family didn't like our marriage. But what can I do? It's useless to torment me. What's done can be undone. Still bringing up divorce? - Yes. The difference between us is huge. And I don't have the patience to live with your family! So I wired my uncle to come. You wired your uncle? - Yes. I told you I didn't like his being here. He's the only relative I have. The only person who loves me. And me? - You? You have relatives: mother, grandfather, great-grandfather! Listen, Marta, I know your uncle much better than you. You weren't in America when we met. You can't know what your uncle is. I know very well. He's my mother's only brother. As soon as he heard that I was orphaned, he wired saying he would provide for my future. He had only seen me once, when I was 3 years old. He's a man with a big heart. - I don't doubt it. But you've never spent a day with him. Because I fell in love. If instead of that steamer, I had taken another… Marta, don't make me say something I might regret. I know it already. You do? I found out about it 2 days after our wedding. And that's why I wanted a divorce. What? You only wanted a divorce just because your uncle… Forgive me, dear. Your generosity… It was a shock to me. I didn't know… I saw all my happiness lost. I loved you so much. And I was sure of your sincerity. No, you couldn't have known your uncle was a gangster. My uncle is not a gangster. - What? He's not. He's never been! He's only a smuggler. - But smuggling is a crime. Selling wine is no crime! Even your mother sells wine! - What do you mean? Doesn't she have vines, harvests them and sells wine too? Just like Uncle Joe! Red Joe is flying! Red Joe, you can't get him, that's true. - That's true! Red Joe is going! Red Joe's fooling you, all the time! - All the time! Red Joe is flying! Red Joe, you can't get him, that's true! Red Joe! Red Joe! Red Joe! WHERE IS RED JOE HIDING? After miraculously fleeing a rival gang's vendetta, Red Joe has mysteriously disappeared without a trace. POLICE ARE SEARCHING FOR RED JOE RED JOES HAS DISAPPEARED FOR A WEEK NO MORE NEWS OF THE DREADED GANGSTER WAS RED JOE KILLED BY HIS RIVAL GANG? Red Joe is flying! Red Joe, you can't get him, that's true! Red Joe is flying, Red Joe… Hotel Excelsior Monte Carlo We'll text you the telegram that arrived today in New York: I'm in an almost tragic situation. Only Uncle Joe can save me. Come quickly. Love, Marta. Hello? Hello? I must go immediately to Sant'Agata Marina. "Beautiful beaches?" I don't care if they're ugly! I must go now. 2 days by train? No train! Airplane! Yes. Flying! Airplane! Yes, Sant'Agata Marina! Germano! A little more lemonade for the duke. No, I don't want lemonade. But it's an excellent remedy for uric acid. I don't care about uric acid! I want cognac! Grandpa is right. - These are doctor's orders. Germano, a lemonade. - But His Excellency… Serve the lemonade or you're fired. And I'll fire you if you don't serve me cognac. Come on, grandpa, how can you be so grumpy? I want cognac! - But it's not good for you. At your Excellency's age, one no longer takes cognac. What "age"? Besides, I'm only 94. 95, you big flirt! Just turned it. It takes a while… to get to 150. Let's go have a swim! I'll come some day! Piero! Why haven't you gone to the beach yet? If you keep up a defiant tone with my mother, it'll be worse. Sure, blame me. The importance we place on the painting seems to annoy you. It doesn't annoy me! I only notice the importance of your mother suspecting me! - That's not true. Yet you must see how inopportune your uncle's presence will be. Why? - What do you mean "why?" It wasn't worth the trouble to hide the truth about your uncle but that he'd come here… What he did in America is none of your business! Dear Uncle Joe! - "Dear Uncle Joe!" But having an uncle in the house who makes his own law with a gun… Enough! You'll never understand him! Enough! But it's Uncle Joe! Yes, it's Uncle Joe! Uncle Joe! Here I am! Marta! Listen! Wait! Uncle! Is that really you? Yes! It's really me! Come here! Wha… what's going on? Where is my son? In the airplane, Madame Duchess. I think it's Mrs Marta's uncle. And why doesn't he come down? I have no idea, Mme Duchess. Oh, my darling! You didn't think you would see me? To be honest… I told him I wired you but I didn't expect you so soon. Me? Always very early! I was in Monte Carlo. Drink this. Your telegram… bounced from New York. I bounced here! Happy? - So much! Is it because of him you're sad? - No! Now listen, young man. This girl must be happy, you see? She must. You are Duke, you have a duty to be a good man, do you understand? I… - Don't interrupt me. I want to see for myself why this girl is unhappy. If it's your fault, know that no one has ever made a fool of me. Never! You understand? I'll explain all… - No, let me. First of all Mr Mark, allow me to say, your presence in the villa… it's best to pass over for now. Why? - You see, Uncle, Stefano thinks… Don't speak for him! Let him say what he thinks. Mr Mark, right now there's a police inspector in the villa. Why should I care? I'm used to police inspectors! But this inspector is investigating. Why? - Because there was a theft. An item of great value! Tell me everything! I know all about thefts! As a relative he may be our guest, but as an American… What do you think, D'Arment? Dear cousin, I think Americans nowadays can enter into the best families. Then we'll house him in the left wing. Germano, listen here. After what happened, I couldn't welcome into the castle you and your "helpers." I don't need help. My helpers won't come but I will. But why? - Am I not your wife's uncle? Can't I see her? - Yes but… I want to see her in her home. To see how you treat her. Who's giving her a hard time? - Nobody. Because if anyone hurts this girl… You see this stuff? - Yes! No… If you hurt this girl, you'll never see her again! Because you'll close your eyes and never open them again! Let's go! It looks like a funeral. Here they are, Mme Duchess! Mr Joe Mark. Grandfather, I introduce to you Mr Joe Mark, Marta's uncle. How do you do? Duke Gontrano of Sandelle-Lafitte, Visconte of Lysieux, Marchese of Mendoza and Pereira, my grandfather, father-in-law to my mother, the head of my family. Done yet? How do you do? Sir, in 1492, Cristoforo Colombo visited your great country. Allow me to shake your hand and tell you how moved I am by the return of your visit. Should I make a speech too? The Duchess of Sandelle-Lafitte, my mother. How do you do? A fine old lady! My sister Annamaria. - How do you do? The Marchese Giuliano… - How do you do? My cousin… - Stop! How do you do? Stop. How do you do? Welcome. - Thank you What interests me to know who is the detective. The police inspector? - Yes. Here is the police inspector, Mr Agenore Champol. Him? I should be afraid of that? How do you do? Why should you have been afraid of me? No, Mr Mark is just joking. I'm not joking. I've never been afraid of the police. - Uncle! It's a misunderstanding, Mr Mark. Please be silent. No, I want to tal… talk. What misunderstanding? Wha… wha…what is there to hide? But… - Have you been around police a lot? It's my job. - Ah, you're a little… Not a little, a lot! - You're not a… a policeman? Yes, Mama, a famous policeman. An ace of his trade. In America, the police are highly respected. Right, Mr Mark? Very much so. I'm super respected. Even the captain is afraid of me. - Afraid? No, Mr Mark expresses himself poorly. He means that he is esteemed, respected by higher ups. Right? Yes, as the best (boom-boom) shooter. A police officer has never intimidated me. Me neither. I'm well pleased to shake hands with a brave man, who does not fear a life of dangers and traps. - Bravo! Mr Mark, you'll stay with us a while, right? Me? - Mr Mark can't. He has to make inquiries on the Côte d'Azur. He can't stay. What a shame! - I can stay. Yes, Uncle, stay! Would you like that, Marta? - Yes. OK, Duchess, I'll stay. - Good. I… would be grateful. This way you can help Mr Champol. Oh, yes, Mr Mark! - Do I have to help him? You should know… - Quiet! I was informed by Stefano of the junk. Ju… junk? About… about… the matter! Then let's pray that you'll find our mas… masterpiece. I will do what I can. I know about theft. And I'm sure of your success. Come, my dear daughter. She called me "dear daughter!" Unbelievable! You know what's more unbelievable? - What? I came to Europe to be a policeman! This is what I discovered putting the various elements together: The thief entered through a window. It can only be a first floor window, as we found all the doors and windows on the ground floor locked from the inside. Are you convinced? Mr Champol, I'm convinced that you are not a good thief. Me? - You. The first quality of a thief is to steal in order to make money with the loot. Right? - But… Don't you think so? Quiet. The profession of a thief is to earn. If you steal to earn, then I say, "Why steal this painting from this room when there's so much better stuff to steal in this room too?" But the painting is of enormous value. But it's hard to sell. You don't know: everyone wants to take the bread out of your mouth. But here? So much easier! You can take a small knife. Magnificent! Here's a key to open it. You open it up. Take this, put it in your pocket and go sell it and earn money for your work. Got it? On the other hand, if you steal a painting, where do you put it? In your pocket? No! We must prepare in advance: a buyer, a shipper. Was the thief prepared? I don't know. - I don't know either. But I will know. - Not me. Quiet! I cabled to America. There they buy all the paintings. Please. I want to know all the people who were in the villa during the theft. But you met them, I thought. No, I want to know who they are, not who they say they are. Mr Mark, you don't suspect… - Everybody! Do you know who stole it? No. The thief can also be among honest people. Got it? If you were a cop in America, I could even steal the President of the Republic! Good morning, Annamaria! - I've been waiting since 10:30. Mia querida. Esta noche… - Stop it! Someone may pass by. - Let's go to Deauville then. To compromise ourselves more? Can't you just be on time? But then let me sleep la noche. But aren't you capable of making a sacrifice for me? When I'm awake, yes. But when asleep, no me recuerdo de nada. When you're awake? And then you went to play again last night. But I won, mi hermosa, I won! But you could also lose. You know I can't. I can't! Mama is inflexible and the little my husband left me isn't enough. And you crees it's good taste to hold my bad luck against me? You even forget that I wait for you. I was dreaming. I was dreaming of still having you conmigo, close to me. Close to me. Somebody's there. Good morning. - Morning. Morning, Duchess. - What a lovely day! Ah, wonderful! Wonderful! - You just came in? Yes. I didn't see you on the beach. I was in the water. I'm going to get dressed. If you return to Deauville, wait for me, OK? Bye bye, Duchess. You didn't just come in. - No. But why that tone, Annamaria? And why that lie, Marta? I wanted you to think I didn't hear. Or didn't want me to think you were spying? How can you think that? Besides, you wouldn't have seen anything. You'll have noticed Giuliano loves me. The Spaniards get so excited. Therefore it's useless for you to tell Mama. Bye. Annamaria! Annamaria, listen… No, not that. No and no! I will never allow it! "I won't allow it?" And me? Little boy! Uncle, what happened? Stefano? He was a little scared. - In short, what is this about? I met him on the beach. You know how he is: he hugs, squeezes you! I hug back and I notice your uncle is among us armed! As if he were among brigands! - It's much worse! Because they show themselves when they fire and kill. You steal a painting worth millions and don't say who did it. Now you're insulting us. Very nice! You see? Enough of this nonsense. Just because I carry a small revolver… He carries a hankie to blow his nose and I carry a revolver to sleep peacefully. But in our house… - In your house, Moses was stolen! A great prophet! Imagine what they'd do to me: little Joe Mark and not a prophet! My baby! He's a scoundrel of the worst kind. I don't understand how he got into a family like that. But are you sure? Is it possible? Do you question what I tell you? And then the fingerprints speak for themselves. The Duchess must be notified immediately. No! For heaven's sake, it'll kill her! Rather, I have a plan… The first investigation complete, today there'll be an interrogation. Are you going to interrogate everyone in the house? I'm going to say yes. - I'm so scared. You should be afraid if somebody interrogates me! But I'm the one doing the interrogation! I don't respect anyone here. Except you and the old duke. And Stefano? Stefano too. But just to please you. That idiot Champol respects everybody here. Old Germano: "above all suspicion." The little Spaniard who looks like a gigolo: "above all suspicion." Everyone's above. Nobody's below! That Spanish guy? I don't like him. Old Germano? I don't like him. They all have curious faces. Even tonight, I waited for you in vain. Then it's true? You've had enough of me? Don't make unnecessary scenes. I'll see you later, and when we're safe, I'll explain everything to you. But now I must go. Adios, amor. Ah, if you could find that picture! I think even the Duchess would be grateful! She would treat me better. You think so? - Sure, out of gratitude. We are ruined. Champol is over there. With a very grim face! He says he's gathered information. And he wants to talk to you alone! He knows everything. We're ruined! Wait a minute! You think that Champol… - Certainly! He made a chuckle, so sinister, so sinister… Sinister, angelic, it doesn't matter! I'll go myself to this Champol. I'm no imbecile. What are you going to do? - Don't be silly! I know we're not in America. I played and lost. I will find a way somehow. Please, don't hurt him. You think I'm one who can kill a man like a fly? I'm in such a state that… I'm in a state too. On my word, I'd be sorry if it all got out. Go on, leave me alone. Mr Mark, I know everything. Damn! A scoundrel has entered this noble family. A rogue! - Watch what you say. No! We need to brand with infamy this ignoble character. I say that's enough! - I know what you would say. He's an alien, a foreigner. Well no! What do you mean "no?" He's not a foreigner. - Who? The so-called Marquis Escojido y Pereira You want to talk about him? Of course. Didn't you tell me to gather information on him? And you're giving me that information? Mr Champol, you're a fine man. You cannot imagine how happy you've made me. Well then, this Spaniard? Spaniard? He's as Spanish as I am. I telegraphed Seville. The last Escojido y Pereira died of paralysis at the age of 23. His father's locked up in an insane asylum. A nice family! So what about this gigolo? That's the word: A gigolo. Nothing but a little gigolo! His real name is Giulio Galè. He was born in… I love very much the thrill of the sea. Multo delicioso... Mr Escojido, do you know how to swim? Near the beach, yes. Where I touch it with las patas. But fuera? I couldn't. Here the water is very deep. Yes, it is. Oh, yes. I like you very much. Gracias. Thank you. I would very much hate to throw you overboard. But are you… No, I'm not crazy. Please don't force me. I'll throw you into the sea if you don't answer me. Answer what? You must answer this: Where did you put the picture of Moses you stole? You're crazy! You left fingerprints on my cigarette case the other day. With them, Mr Champol found out all in the archives. There must be a misunderstanding. A terrible one. Mr Mark, I beg you… No begging. You see you've lost that Spanish accent? No Spanish! You're not Spanish nor Escojido. Champol told me your name which I have forgotten. You were a croupier in Barcelona in a casino. And a year and a half in prison in Marseilles! Mr Mark, this is a vile slander! I did nothing… Want me to throw you in the sea? - No, stop! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! I'll confess, but stop! Do you see? Good manners… will get you everywhere. Yes, it's true, I was a croupier, a dancer… I was working. Working doesn't dishonor anybody. I've known many hard workers, including some forced for life. Where did you put the painting? I didn't do it! Believe me, Mr Mark! Do you think if I had taken it, I would still be here? I would've gone to sell it, don't you think? It's true. Annamaria! You did well to come! This way you can say bye to Mr Escojido who's leaving! Where is he going? Back to Spain! Adios, caballero! Adios! It's absurd! Your uncle has taken the role of policeman too seriously. He's pestering everyone with indiscreet questions, unexpected visits to the rooms. If your mother put him in charge, is that his fault? No! My mother doesn't know who Mr Mark is. Anyway, she charged him to investigate. Not to chase the guests away. Who did he chase away? - The Spaniard. He leaves offended on the 5 o'clock train. It's unbearable. Please, tell your uncle I won't tolerate it! So you're leaving like this? Yes, I must go. Believe me. Listen, If you leave, I'll tell all! Say whatever you want. I won't stay here one minute more. But why? After what happened between us? Don't be so melodramatic. I wasn't the first, was I? And I won't be the last. Yes, Duke? Where is Miss Clavel? I don't know. Do you need anything? I need Miss Clavel! Look for her. Look for her! I must ask you something. Must I swear to tell the truth? The whole truth and nothing but the truth? No. I met a judge… who when a woman had to testify in court, always said: "Swear to do your best to tell the truth." But… European women are more sincere. My question is: this Marquis Giuliano of Escojido, where did you meet him? - In Paris, by chance. Paris is very big. I don't remember exactly. At a party, I believe. There are many parties in Paris. You're not saying that…? - It's you who are not saying. I say very simple things. Isn't Paris big? Aren't there many parties? Precisely. It'd make sense to meet him at one of these parties. The Marquis is very nice. A distant relative. Cordiality strengthens kinship. - Perfectly. Friendship grows. - Perfectly. Intimacy. - Perfectly. And love? - What? Isn't the Marquis Giuliano your lover? - You're mad! You insult me! I beg your pardon. I don't speak your language well. You can't be that stupid gigolo's lover. Now you're insulting my relative. Excuse me. I don't know what I'm saying anymore. I put my foot in it! How stupid. If you had gone into the Marquis' room, you would've seen it. What? The scene he made with his lover! His lover? - She slapped him. If I'm not mistaken, only lovers do that. And who was it? Miss Clavel. An insignificant girl… Oh, the wretch! The wretch! I'm very sorry to have given you displeasure. Maybe it's for the best. That little man doesn't deserve you. Why did he deceive you? Why say he loves you? Why? Why? To get I know what. And I also brought him into my house! Oh, well, a distant relative… I was crazy! Blind! Did you pay his debts? Yes, he played, he lost. - And you paid. When you had no money, you went to the antique dealer in Rouen. My emerald necklace! But how do you know? I know. But you don't suspect me? No! No! I'm not capable of that! I'm very happy, Annamaria. May I call you Annamaria? I'm really happy. I know you didn't lie about the painting. I hear it in your voice! And regarding the necklace, don't worry. I am your friend. And Marta is a sister to you. No, that little Spanish gigolo is just a gigolo. He didn't steal the Moses. How can you be so sure? I know thieves. You need to get me more information. Like that waiter, Germano. But he's been in this house for 30 years! And I think he should spend the next 30 in prison. But what are you going to do? Interrogate him? No, I don't want to waste my breath. He won't confess even if you question him for hours. How then? Do you know the third degree? - The third grade? It's a form of interrogation used by the American police. First degree, second degree, third degree. Do you see the difference? It's hard to deny under the third degree. Where did you go tonight? To the Prince Sant Girald. But you, by what right… This is my right. Who is this Prince? But I said it! I'm saying it again too. Is he your friend? - A friend of the house. And why did he give you this check for 10,000 francs? Excuse me, I'm the curious type. It says "Germano Dubois" there. I had to give it… I had to give it… to a person! Which person? I can't say! I knew you couldn't. But I will make you. Go on... OK. You see? This is much nicer. If you don't tell me, I'll repeat it. But these are the methods of outlaws! We're all a bit on the outlaw side here. Why did this prince give you this check for 10,000 francs? Because he owed it to me. Why did he owe it to you? - Because of my work. Mr Mark, I swear! Fine, the Prince was the lover of Duchess Sofia. And since I knew, they wanted me to shut up. Ah, you were blackmailing them? Fine. Now tell me… what is this bank book with 320,000 francs? Just my savings. Damn, what savings! You see, Mr Mark, I had rein of the house, the groceries… I helped myself here and there, you see? I do see: You were stealing! Mr Mark, I swear! I swear… Don't shout so! You'll be out of breath for what comes next, which is worse! Now give me all the letters you have. Mr Mark, I don't have them. No! No! No! I'll tell all! I'll tell all! I'll tell you all. In the jacket, sewn inside, there are the two letters. Take them. I've told all. You see? Good manners will get you everywhere! And now tell me, you poor thing, what do you know about the painting? I know nothing, Mr Mark! I swear! For God's sake, don't start again. Don't tell me what to do! Answer me! But why would I steal such a dangerous thing, when with simple savings on spending, everything went smoothly? That's right... Good. Oh! Good morning, dear nephew! Good morning, Mr Mark. You can call me "uncle." I won't be offended. Mr Mark, do you know that Germano is leaving us? Oh, why? - I'm asking you. Me? Yesterday Giuliano de Escojido, today Germano. You want to send away the whole house? - Why should I? Mr Mark, please be serious. Germano has been in our house for 25 years. Then it's time for him to go. But uncle, what else happened? I don't know! Germano said he wanted to go. I didn't tell Germano "Go!" Something serious must've happened. Germano sent word that he's ill and can't come down. And that he wants to leave. I don't at all believe he's sick. Why not? We must believe him. - I wish I knew something though. And you will know. You have your car? To do what? - To go to the Rouen Town Hall. Then take a look in the Registry Office of Rouen, for the year of 1912. You'll be able to read things very new to you. What do you mean? If I tell you, you won't believe me. It's 10:00. In an hour and a half, you'll be in Rouen. Look, verify, come back. And you'll have faith in this poor, little believed Joe Mark! What? Did you…? Please, this is just nonsense. Look into my eyes. I swear to you in the registry of the town hall of Rouen, in the year of 1912, you will read things that'll be very new to you. Mind you, Rouen's not far away. Go to Rouen, I can't ask for anything more. Fine, I'm going. Excuse me, dear, you see how serious this is, if what he says is true. Stefano, it's true if he says so. You can believe it without going. No, I prefer him to go. Yes, Marta, I prefer it too. Goodbye, Mr Mark. - Have a good trip! Your husband is stupid. - What did you say? Have a good trip! Stupid! But what will he read there? He'll read the names of the inhabitants of Rouen born in 1912. And then? And also the names of the inhabitants who died in 1912. But you swore he'll read new things. And the names of the inhabitants of Rouen born and dead in 1912, won't be new for him? Uncle, why did you do this? Because if your dear Stefano was always in my way, I couldn't do anything. So, go away! I need to be free here today. Why is Germano leaving? - I don't know. He says he's quitting and doesn't claim any compensation. Who knows what'll happen to us? Maybe another dirty trick? From whom? - Well… you wouldn't know. Good day, Mme Duchess! Good day, Mr Mark. Any news? A small but good one. But I'd like to ask Miss Annamaria to go to her room. Why? - There's a package for you. Excuse me, Mama, but it's so strange that… Did you give her a present? And one for you too. - What? Look at it. I'll wait. Mr… Mr Mark, whe… where did you fi… find these letters? In Germano's wallet. Now you'll send him away? Ye… yes, immediately! Ro… ro… rogue! It… it was 25 ye… years ago. Maybe I… I was too weak the… then bu… but but I feared the consequences of a sca… sca… scandal, that my husband would find out and after his death, my father-in-law and my children. You un… un…understand me, right? Oh, I un… un… But how did you get these let… letters? Did you pa… pay someone? No… no… nothing! Not even a cent. A more forceful system. This is your emerald necklace that little Spanish rascal stole. I took it kindly from him and now he's kindly in the hospital. Best regards. Joe Mark. You gave Germano a lot of money. Oh, Mr Mark! A… a lot. But didn't you do anything stupid to get the money he wanted? Really, Mr Mark! Maybe you thought or Germano advised you… What? Tell me the whole truth. I'm a friend, almost a relative. But what do you mean? The Murillo! The painting! Maybe you sold it to… Oh, no! No! Never! Never! I'd… I'd rather die! The Murillo! But how could you even think it? And don't cry! Turn off the faucets. I just said… But it's frightening! I just want to say this: The painting is in the castle. I have 4 helpers with me, who asked all the fences in Marseilles, Bordeaux, all the thieves and antique dealers. Nobody has the Murillo. The Moses is still here. I will find it! Mr Mark, may heaven hear you. I leave you the widest fre…freedom, Se…search, rum… rummage, investigate. Oh, I will se… se… rum… rum… I want free rein! If you hear a little scream or a boom, a blow, don't get scared. A bl… blow? - I'll tell you about it later. What's that? - Quiet! My boys are coming. - Wha… what's going on? If the painting is still in the Sandelle-Lafitte Castle, Moses will be fished out! Joe Mark's word of honor! What do you want to do? - Search all rooms. Go swimming. Leave it to us. - But what if someone comes? If he doesn't disturb us, I don't care. - And if he does? I told Duchess not to be scared if she hears screams. Go swimming. Come here! Excuse me, Sir Duke. Are you looking for something? You going to the beach? I'm waiting for my governess. Come in. Who is that beautiful young lady? She's my secretary. Pretty! She doesn't understand. What a pity! I can say only one word in English: Sleeping car! But I can also say another phrase I memorized. Give me a kiss! Give me a kiss! Yes. Well done! Very kind! Sleeping car! Tell her I'm taking her on as a second governess. Yours is better. You want to visit her on the beach? She's not on the beach. Excuse me! Don't scream! If you shout, I shut your mouth. If you don't scream, I'll take my hand off. OK? If you scream, I'll tell that you went every night to the ex-Spaniard's room. I know! I know about it. If you don't scream, I won't say anything. OK? You are diplomatic! But… But what…? What do you want from me? Nothing! Just a small search. Now go to the Duke and don't say a word. I won't say anything either. OK? Go ahead! - OK. The ideas that get into some people's heads! Crazy stuff: 1912. 1912? I'll give you 12! Here is the year. 1912: January, February, March. Enjoy! Mr D'Arment! What is the matter? What happened? I saw you from the window and came to meet you. I must tell you something very important. Come to my room. Yes, that's fine but I can't take it anymore! Come on, Germano, buck up. I need to see Mr Champol right away. Mr Champol went to the police HQ, taken in charge by Mr Mark. Mr Mark! The great policeman! I know what he is: a bandit! Worse than the others. Look at what they did to me. Come to me. I need to know everything. Here in my room, you can rest for a while. What is all this? Be quiet. And you? What are you doing here? Shut up! We're doing a little search! Don't be scared! We'll tidy up after. But how dare you? Who gave you permission? Don't make me get tough! This is a shameful action! But I will speak up! - Up? You will speak low! In fact, you won't say another word! Unless I give the orders! Got it? I forbid you! You forbid me? Mr D'Arment, don't say anything! You're a bandit! Bandit? Me? No, it's not true! - Someone said that to him! Maybe you? Me? No! Have mercy! I'll burn your tongue off! Moses! Moses with water! So I'm the bandit? Welcome back, Moses! But is it possible then…? Is this it, Duchess? Yes, this is it! The Moses! Oh, dear! No doubt about it, it's the Moses! I'm so happy, Uncle! How good you are! Where did you find it? In Mr D'Arment's room! But who stole the painting? Mr D'Arment. D'Arment! D'Arment! Our dear cousin! But this unheard of! God, what a sca… sca… scandal! But where is he now? Who? - D'Arment! In his room. But don't be afraid. He's waiting for me. We need to inform the Inspector of Fine Arts to come and negotiate. What joy! In a few days it'll be sold! What joy! And my father-in-law will be happy. And Stefano! Marta! My daughter! A wonderful thing! Mr Mark has found the Moses. Duke! The Moses! The Moses. There he is. The Moses. Ah! He's ill! No, we'll be delighted to receive you. The Minister will come? What an honor! It's joy. I've known a man who had a joy like that. When they changed his sentence from the electric chair to prison for life. Uncle! Nonsense. All's well that ends well. The Moses by Murillo was sold 42 years ago to Vanderbilt. The one that was stolen is just a copy. This is a small disaster! It's ruin! It's the ruin of the Sandelle-Lafitte! 7… 7… 7 generations destroyed! Oh, no: 7 million! His Excellency is almost here. I hear him! My God! All is lost. Even the hon… hon… millions! Excellency! Excellency! I… I am… You're the only woman who could worthily guard such a great work of art. Thank you, Your Excellency, but please, shall we open the dance? Will you? It'd be a great honor. Now is the time. Watch the exits. And as soon as you see this gentleman… trying to slip away, jump on his neck without mercy! Remember: he has a foreign accent. He's brutal and he's a… gangster! So he's ready for anything! Remember: ready for anything! Here's the proof. He's a bandit. The worst of bandits! A gangster! I found it all out. I know all. This evening I'm… I'm… Relieved? - No! Dying! And Marta is his niece. My son's wife! Oh, it's awful! The Duchess of Sandelle-Lafitte is the mother-in-law of a gangster's niece! Oh, what times! What times! However, the police should be notified. No! No, please! No police! No scandal! You know nothing. - What? The Murillo that was found… is not the Murillo. What is it? - It's fa… Fa…? - Fake! The certified copy is in America, sold 4… 42 years ago. Who did you hear this from? - The gangster! No, I mean our dear relative. Have you decided to leave tomorrow? Absolutely. But isn't it strange they kept a fake painting at home for 42 years believing it to be true? Oh, there are so many strange things in this house. Mr Mark. First of all, my family knows who you are. Champol found out. What a curious guy Champol is. When he had to find out something, he couldn't. Now that no one asks him to, he finds out everything! But uncle! - Not him, uncle. After what I learned today about your family, I'd fit right in. - Enough! I may have been blinded by love for Martha, but the moment comes when the blinders drop. Mr Mark, where is the Murillo? I gave it to your mother. - Not that, the real one. You expect me to know…? - Oh, yeah? Look, 42 ​​years ago, I was a 13 year old boy. Very bright but not bright enough to steal a Murillo! Maybe at 13 but at 55, when opportunity calls… But are you…? Ah, I get it! You're saying I would have taken the real one and given you the false. You're right. You're not as stupid as I thought. You are so much more! I knew you wouldn't be so naive as to confess all right away. Only, Joe Mark, remember that this is also your niece's home, and you must not make her unhappy. I talked to my mother. She's ready, for my sake, to regard the thing as if nothing happened. Provided you return to us you know what without forcing us to notify the police. Well? Well what? You are a fool! I said I didn't take it! - But there's too much evidence! For example, sending me to Rouen. But the Notary D'Arment confessed! Because he didn't know you were going to replace it, that's the truth! You are crazy! You don't know Red Joe! Because I do know you! Look at your niece. You can read in her eyes she sees the truth of my words. You? You too? Ah, not you, my darling. You understand me, right, dear? Talk to him. Help me avoid this nasty business. Uncle Joe, if what Stefano says is true, do as he says. Do it for me. Even you? Not you, Little Marta. Do you remember when you were a little pink thing who wouldn't sleep if Uncle Joe didn't sing a song? You were 4 years old. You couldn't tell the difference between a good man and a man… like me. Red Joe was a bad man, who has done so many bad things. But to you? Never. Always Uncle Joe. Now you don't believe your Uncle Joe anymore. Marta! My little Marta. You were the dearest thing in the world to me. Look in my eyes! Look in my eyes! It's not true! It wasn't me! You believe me, Marta? And now I don't care if you don't believe me or not, not you, your sister, nor the Du… du… Duchess, your mo… mo… ther! You're wrong, Mr Mark. If not for yourself, do it for your niece. What do you want me to do? - You found out who did it. Try to… But that was from 8 days ago. This is from 42 years ago! And not just stolen but sold. That's easier! - No, more honest. It's easier to find someone who steals dishonestly, than to find one that sells honestly. I know that to be believed, I'd need to find out who sold it. Of course, Uncle! Somebody in your family should know something. This painting has been sold. One of you must know. Not you! You weren't born. Your father? But my father, 42 years ago, was 22. He had no power at home. - Your uncle? My father was an only child. - Listen! You don't think your family sold it. You don't think they stole it. Nobody does anything in your family? What do you want to do now? One can see the hand of the master right away. It's in very good condition. You almost wouldn't think that… - Wha… what? No, I think we'll make a great deal negotiating the purchase for the Pinacoteca Nazionale. Did the old Duke never tell you anything about this Murillo? Never, Mr Mark. Did he never tell you anything about his youth? Never, Mr Mark. Try and remember. In his confidence, did any name stand out? Names? Yes. When he falls asleep in his armchair after breakfast, I often heard him repeat the name "Elena." Elena? - Yes. Who's that? - His poor wife's name. And no other name stood out? There was! Once, the name of "Maria" escaped him. "Treacherous Maria." I remember it well. And you don't know who that was referring to? Actually, a few days later, I asked him if he had known a Maria. He mentioned me a certain Maria Desclauzas. Apparently, she was a famous actress of her day. And did he mention this Maria's name only once? I think other times too. But I confess I didn't give it much importance. But I give it a lot! OK, thank you very much. Miss Clavel, get the Duke out of here. Duchess! Your Excellency, if I may, Mr Joe Mark. A… a… - A friend? No! An antique dealer. A pleasure. - From abroad? Yes, but now let's go over there, Your Excellency, please. I know all! I know who you are! I know who you are too: an idiot! I don't want to go to bed. Duke! Let's go prepare a little prank for our enemies. What a jovial character! You always wants to make jokes. Here we can talk a little about the old days! The old days? What do you know about that, child? My dear man, I was already 30 years old when Napoleon III reigned in France. I am 93. 93. - 93? You don't look it! You still look like a young man. You are a rank flatterer, Mr Mark. I didn't have the pleasure of knowing you back then. I wasn't bad back then. Who knows how many little ladies lost their heads over you! I wasn't bad back then. The women must have gone… 1, 2… and 3! …crazy for you! You probably were very generous, right? Flowers, jewelry, clothes… Duke, you must have bitten a huge chunk out of the Sandelle-Lafitte wealth! You were the master of everything: A castle, precious keepsakes, furniture, pictures! Why mention pictures? - Excuse me. I envy you! France! Paris! Back then, a man knew how to have fun. I too had a little adventure. With a girl: Two legs, two eyes, a back! You've never seen a woman as beautiful as that. Oh, yeah? I bet you've never seen a woman as beautiful as that! You make me smile. I did meet one… Beautiful as mine? Impossible! Everyone was crazy about her. What shoulders! What a line! And what a voice! You had to hear and see her in "Madame Angot's Daughter". Have you seen "Madame Angot's Daughter"? No. Mlle Lange played the role. A cherub! When she used to sing, "The warriors of Augerau are puppets, big babies. Our weaklings will defeat…" The Parisians would all go crazy. But you were her favorite? I was! I was! But the Parisian ladies were fickle even back then. And she cheated on you? I meant someone more generous… No. Not at all. A trombone player! Crazy! I tell you I was crazy! You can't even imagine it. For her and just for her, I would have… have… - Have? "The warriors of Augerau are puppets, big babies." My father was in Paris a long time ago, and played in the orchestra. That may be. He was a handsome man. He too had an affair with a beautiful operetta actress, and they ran off together. The actresses in that day were beautiful and crazy. And my father said she was very beautiful and crazy. And her name was… Her name was Maria Desclauzas! Huh? What? And they ran off together because she was tired of being with a French nobleman who was very stupid. And very stingy. She said "very stupid and very sti… sti…"? But she knew how to get him to spend his money. And he ruined himself. Because of her! Her! And she also ran away because this Frenchman didn't want to give her a painting… That's not true. How is that? What do you know? It was her! She was Maria Desclauzas. Mimi! And I was the old fool. But the stuff about the picture isn't true. Because if she had asked me… - You would've given it to her? Sure! Hadn't I already given her everything? But perhaps the Murillo was the only treasure left? And didn't I also give her my poor Elena's jewels? The jewels are not the Murillo! And didn't I give her all of our possessions in Provence? Everything, I tell you. All of it! And how did you manage to live if you no longer had anything? That was the reason I had to sell the Murillo! So it was you who sold it? Yes, it was me. And do you know they blamed me? You? No! This will not be allowed. Our Joe Mark is innocent. I know who sold the painting. But it's a family secret and as such, you will know when I am gone. Mr Mark, I apologize. You are a good young man. Then we'll have to reject the minister's proposal. Shall we tell the truth? It's like pulling teeth getting this family to tell the truth! Dukes and Duchesses of Sandelle-Lafitte, let me tell you one thing, today is the 16th of August. On September 16, you'll be able to sell your famous painting. You realize what you're saying? Sell a fake? No, sell the real one. But if the original was sold to the Vanderbilt? You'll get the original. I'll get it for you. You? Are you going to bu… buy it? Buy it? Oh, no. Red Joe uses other methods! How then would you…? - Stefano! Mr Mark, we thank you. Grandpa! Mr Mark has promised to give us back our Murillo! Really? Really? Yes, I promised. Mr Mark, 7 generations of the Sandelle-Lafitte thank you on my behalf. Oh, our guests! We forgot all about them. All I had to do was lie… to get their respect! English subtitles by sineintegral@KG
