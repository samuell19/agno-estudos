Yes, yes. Hey, Chief. I'm not sure this is the right time. Fuck that. They know me, Sport. Any chance your nine-inch claim is a bit of an overstatement. What? Are you some authority on my cock now? I've seen that. I'm not sure that makes me an authority. When? After our workout. Yes. Well, it's not nine inches after I peel off my bone handles. Even still. Even still what, shit bird? The physics just don't equate. You think a woman of Jade's caliber was going to settle for six inches? Look, all I'm saying is you are not nine. Fine, eight. If you think I'm dropping down to seven, you need to go see a motherfucking optometrist. The is dropping in 30 seconds, people. Who wants him? Fuck, yes. You know what time it is. I love my baby so much. I love you too, sweetheart. Your time is now. Instagram. I finally get to kill myself a commie. Lock and load, motherfuckers. I love you. I love you too. Get him. After all the talk, all the insults, World War III is finally erupting. Tyron, USA versus Russia. We've broken this fight down. Stylistic, literally down to a molecule. These guys cannot stand each other. It's going to make for a spectacular match up. It could be an instant classic. Cash is in the cage. The crowd is on its feet. Let's through it to the ring announcer, Richie Simmons. Come on. Now, for the fight we've all been waiting for. From the sold-out MGM Grand in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada, it's time, for damage. In the blue corner, fighting out of st. Petersburg, Russia, standing five foot 8 inches, weighing 170 pounds with an impressive of 18 wins, four losses, the world's number one welterweight contender, Timothy 'the Terrible' Koslov. In the red corner, standing five foot nine inches, weighing 171 pounds, fighting out of Birmingham, Alabama. With a record of 37 wins, one defeat, the undisputed Lightweight Champion of the world, the undisputed Welterweight Champion of the world, the Slayer, Lukewood Cash. All right, gentlemen, bring it in. Bring it in, guys. Let's go. Gentlemen, you've both received your shots in the locker room. You all know the rules. If you want to touch gloves, do so now. You can't just commie fuck with nerve of agents fight? It's 1:00 AM on the east coast. Cash, do you want to get this thing started? This election-meddling son of a bitch won't take long. America, suck dick. Get back to your corners. All right, let's go. Let's do this now. Blue corner, are you ready? Red corner, are you ready? Fuck, yes. Let's go. Come on. Yes, yes. That's it, fight's over. Roses are red, violets are blue. I'm feeling pretty tits right now but sure could really use a blow job. That almost rhymed. Eat your heart out, Emily Dickinson. Yes sir, baby. Cash, you are not posting that. Never baby. Oh, yum, yum, yum, yum, drink looks tasty too. If that's all right, sweetheart. Please do not encourage that, Jeez. Its called humor, darling. Not where I come from. Oh, burn. Isn't my son a face God, Dazz. Here we go. I mean it's hard to believe with that faggoty hair and those pretty-boy looks. Chief here slipped one past the goalie back in college. Sport was the youngest ever to make the US judo team. Can you please shut the hell up and just drink your drink. Deserey, we'll let you know if we need anything else. No problem. Just let me know. Thank you. Are you fucking blind. She's tighter than a seven-year-old Korean boy. Enough with the damn Olympic card. Since when did throwing out a resume for a tasty piece of hair pie become a goddamn crime. Have a beer with me, jack her back to the mansion. No mansion jacking. I've got a calculus test tomorrow. Fuck arithmetic. Well, you need to know mom's going to breathalyze my ass right when I get home too. Goddamn whack job she is. Hey, dillweed she might be your ex but she's my mom. Way to go, Jetty. Apologies, Sport. How is Miss Looney Tunes doing anyway? No, threw in the towel last month. What about Tard? How's he? Come on, can you please not call him that for me, please. Fine, pussy hole. Don't you ever stop? Yes. About 10 seconds before I puke. How is Timofey 'The Terrible' feeling right about now. About $3 million richer. You? I made a million bucks per second last night, Sport. Crap. This is me right here on the left. Love you, Jade. You too, Jetty. You got Kareef tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I'll be there. Thanks for including me. Always, Sport, it's fun. Fucker. Hey. Too slow pussy hole. This is mine, fucker. I'm going to need you to help me out this afternoon, Jett. Well I've got Kareef at 3:00 PM, Mom. Just take his Xbox with you and stick him in Patty's office. Patty is busy, Mom. No she's not, trust me. I don't want to go to the gym. He called me a tard. I talked to him, that's done, okay? I want to play with Patrick. No chance, baby. But I want to. Today's no good, Q. Can you get him his meds and finish up everything? I got a client at 7:45. Yes, go. Just don't forget your lunches, okay? I love you guys. Yes, I love you too. Here you go. Swallow. Open. Good man. Hey, when you're finished? Plate in the sink, brush your teeth, and get dressed, okay? Okay. Hey, Jett. Hey Jett. Yes? Will there always be toys in the world? Look I've got a huge test. Just tell me yes or no and I'll promise I'll stop. Yes, there will always be toys. Forever? Yes. Ace, what's up, bro? All good man. You good? Catch you, boys, later. Alright. Yo Q. Hey, how you doing, man? Looking handsome, dog. Thanks, bro. Feel good, boss. My man. Hey, your dad is filthy, man, that's the only way to describe it. Dude, where you there when he made it rain at Olympic Gardens? How did you guys see that? Excuse me, I have a question, do you guys ever stick out your tongues at each other? Quinn. Quinn, did you know Fat Lexy have big, giant lovely boobies? Patrick, come on now. It's funny, Mr. Stewart. No, it's not funny. Your dad is the shit. Okay Jerry. Come on man, what's up? You want detention? No sir. No, that language doesn't fly in my class. Make it quick, Jett. Tongue fixation. No it's not tongue fixation. Jet what the heck is wrong with you. Okay, everybody, calm down, all right. Thanks for the heads up. Thanks, Jett. Improper integrals, huh? Can you get lower than an F? Seriously when she hands back our tests mine's going to have a big red G written across the top. No. Hope this fighting thing works out. Nice baby, nice. You hit that hammer. Again. Good, good. Now, don't get lazy, come on. Move together. QUick and fast. Let's go. There you go. Move, move, move. Go. Vaughn's Fight Academy, this is Patty. Paid for this suit too. Jamie's on two. How's Quinn holding up in there? Other than asking me if he can watch Pornhub, splendidly. Jesus. All right. Jamie, you shaved that hideous fucking beard off yet. Fuck you, Cash. I'm sitting here with my attorney Mr. Adelsberg, aka the Jew assassin. He's just informed me that you and Rami once again are giving it to me up the dirt shoe. Shocking. The gate, merchandise, pay per view, foreign PPV all the way down. Your numbers in Russia alone aren't even close. Yes, all right. I'll get into it with Rami and I'll get back to you fellows. Okay? What does that even mean? They're worse than Putin. Yes, but they can be defeated. Three, two, one. Good, twist. Is this Colbie fucking Caillat. Caillat. Holy fuck, my son's a turd burglar, fellas. How do you expect to issue a beat down when you're listening to all that West Hollywood Meryl Streep bullshit. Colbie's hot Chief. Her, Taylor, and Selena, and they do more for charity than you ever will. I give millions to charity, dickface, it's called taxes. We got to hook you up. System of a Down, Death Tone, Rob Zombie. I love my girls, deal with it. If you say so, Sport? Are you ready to deal with me? No, not a chance. I can't even lift my arms. Hey, I'm wearing skinny jeans, buddy. We're even. Get the fuck up here. You don't need that pussy headgear. Come on. Come on, pussy. Judo fag mama's boy. Oh, shit. We've got a bleeder here. Cash. Hey, Insta, what's up? Yes, I'm back from Vegas with my boy Jett here, about to be arrested for child abuse. Come on, Sport. That's right. Come on Jett, get fisted, baby. Get fisted. Take three, maybe put on some of that Call Me Maybe shit it'll wake his ass up. Holy crap. Finish him, what you doing? This is fucking stupid. You hit me in the fucking face, huh? Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck. I tap. How's that feel? Fuck off. Yo, Patty, you delete that shit. Now. I'm deleting. Jesus. Hey, Quinn, go to bed. Am I good? Yes, solid, Q. Keep practicing you can be in a real band soon slay babes left and right. Now got to bed. Slay babe. Hey, Jett. What? I have a question. Do some girls have wieners? Where'd you hear that? Are you visiting those sites again? Do you want mom to kill you? I won't do it again. I promise. Well, you do it again and I'm telling her. Because it's weird, right? Yes. Very. Now look, it's 10:20 go to sleep. Oh wait, did I have melatonin? Yes. Can you have mom peek on me? Yes. You promise? Yes. Okay, love you, Jett. Love you too. More than yourself? Say it. More than myself. Now go to sleep. Hey. Hey. Not again mom. Made $200 in four hours. It's twice what I make at Pro Sport. Where? The Yard. Mom, everyone we know goes there. Don't give me that look. Physical therapists at 41 is great but waitress at 41 is pathetic. Providing for my boys is pathetic? How many nights a week? No ballpark. Three, four? Yes. Four nights a week, I have Quinn? He's making millions. You want to ask him for more money? Because I'm not doing that. I fought that son of a bitch in court for 10 years. All the while, he never gave me a dime for Quinn's heart surgery, never a dime for his stomach surgery. I know he's back in your life, and I know he's helping you follow your dreams, so I keep quiet, but it's real goddamn hard, Jett. Got you good today? Yes, I do. That was only the second time in what? 22 years of fighting that I got caught by a roundhouse. Yes? When was the first? 10 years ago, Claude. Is that the only time you ever lost a fight? In my life? Fuck, no. Birmingham's 75% black. Homies went Reginald Denny on my ass hourly. Hey, I got a nice surprise for you tomorrow. Don't be late. What is it? Then we multiply all of this by delta X, which is two over N, and this is going to be the setup for rewriting our definite integral using Riemann sum. Have a good after day, everyone. How did you do? Oh, sorry. It's not your fault. Bye, good job. See you. Good job. Great work. Good job. Great work. Yes, well, wish me luck. What are you doing after school? Ms. Malek. Hello, Jett. Is there anything I can do? Yes, you can avoid Las Vegas. That trip was planned. You've known about this test for a month, Jett. Oh, what if I did some extra credit? I think it runs a little deeper than that. That 41 was generous. Look, you missed a lot of important stuff last year. What about a tutor? If I don't pass your class, I don't graduate. Just $25 an hour. Whatever it takes. Yo, Chief. You ready? Yes. Meet your sparring partner? You want me to spar Enrique Castaneda? Number three welterweight in the world. We got to fix your jab. Excuse me. Are you okay? Are you sure? Yes. I'm fine, ma'am. I appreciate your concern though. Thank you. Okay. Hey, y'all. Quinn, look towards me, please. I'm watching the game. There's no TV in here, Quinn. Just shut up and look towards me. Finish your hamburger. Now. I'm going to go watch the game. Hi. Yes, is this Johnny? My name is Jett Boykins. I am a senior at Ramsey High. Hi. Hello. My name is Quinn. What's your name? I was referred to you by Ms. Malek. I have a question. Yes? Do you like every shake out your tongues at each other? Yes, that works perfectly. Thank you and I'll talk to you. Bye. So did you want to see it? We're sorry to bother you, ma'am. Start walking, Quinn. Hey, stop pushing me. What happened to your face? I got my butt kicked. Stop. Shut up. Get in the car. What is your freaking problem, Jett? It's all just so weird and disturbing okay? I can't take it any fucking more. Well, I have bullied syndrome. Don't give me that bullshit. It's my fault. Yes, whose fault is it then? You're such a jerk. Ow. I hate you. I hate you back. That hurt. Hey, Jett, care to listen to Christmas music? You would have been so proud of Kingston today. Mr. Tanaka moves him up from an orange belt to a green. Hold on. He skipped blue? He number one for his age. Little fucking stud. I love you. I love you too, baby. What? What's wrong? I think I'm going to be sick. We should go. I just ordered the bone-in. I know. I'll order you whatever you want. Please, I'm going to throw up. Okay. All right. All right. Shit. You sexy little minx. Fuck, you're so beautiful. You're so fucking beautiful. I love you. I love you. Fuck. Hey. Yes, what's up? Can we just talk for a second, please? Didn't we already talk enough at dinner? Let's see. Kingston's kicking ass in karate and you want a bodyguard, right? It's about Susan. I just went limp. Thanks. Fuck. Listen. I know you insist on keeping her stuff separate from me. I don't insist on anything. We have a contract, remember? Okay, well, I'm sorry to tell you this but I'm your wife. I'm going to have an opinion or two on certain topics which means you are required to listen to me. Okay? Okay. Go. Cash, they need money. Where is this shit coming from, babe? I've been thinking about this shit for the past nine years. We never help with Quinn. He's not your son, Jade. No, he's not. He's your son but that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to help care for him, does it? Fine. Take him for an afternoon. Have Kingston play with him. Great, but that's it. Why? Why, Cash? Why can't we just love him? Love him like we love Kingston? Because he won't love us back. My god. Of course, he will. Why do you say that? Why do you even think that? Because she lied to them about me. Cash, you hit her. Yes, after she attacked me, honey. I had to wait two years before I could even see them. No, she lied to the cops. She lied on the stand. Fuck her. She gets what she gets and she shouldn't be throwing a fucking fit about it. Because of her, they have to suffer? Suffer? No, they learn. Hard work, adversity, struggle. That's how winners are made, not cuddling Kingston around like a fucking... No, no, no don't you fucking do that shit. Don't fucking start with me, Cash. I took fights for 2000. I worked two jobs. I had two little kids. We were this close to being homeless, baby. My old man didn't give me jack shit. Your old man was an abusive drunk who didn't have jackshit to give you. If I give money to Susan, she gives money to Jett and that can't happen. We have four houses and nine cars. I'm done talking about this. Four houses and nine cars, Cash. Jade, fuck you. Fuck you, get the fuck out of here. Yes, I will you fucking cunt. Hi. Hey. Did Quinn go to bed okay? Yes. I'm a terrible mother. Mom. How do I allow my child? This is who I am. Fighting isn't who you are, it's what you do. Clearly I fucking suck at it. Bud, what happened? I got my ass fed to me, Mom. No, with Q. I just wish I had someone else, someone to share with because it never stops. I always feel like a failure. I ask a lot of you, it's not fair, it's not. Did I ever tell you about my first Williams Syndrome convention? No. I had no clue what I was getting into. Quinn had just been diagnosed and I entered this hotel lobby and saw 400 little Willy's running around. I'm like, "Oh my God." I was like a zombie going from session to session obsessed with getting information to somehow fix this problem and I hadn't even cried yet. When a mother learns that she's going to have to take care of a special needs child for the rest of her life she requires a good cry. Right? Yes, you didn't cry. Not once. Then I went into the last session of the weekend. It was on siblings. There was this doctor up there with this long grey hair and this beard, all these years of research and experience. He was talking about how brothers and sisters of kids with special needs turn out to be the most wonderful loving, giving adults. I just lost it. I could not stop crying, tears just... because I knew that would be you. How's the grill? Hurts. Yes, well you'll recover. I know I will recover. Look, sometimes it just seems like you like seeing me hurt. What the fuck do you know about hurt? I'm sorry. You should check out my fight against Ricky Promoter Co at some point tomorrow. Pay close attention to my striking and side leg kicks. You're telling me this why? You need to get away from your judo, Sport. Destroyed Randa, it will destroy you. Jaime wants his fighters upright, not swap and spit on the canvas, capisce? Kapsosh. El hombre. Woman. La mujer. Male friend. El amigo. Female friend. La amiga. Es muy guapo. Hey, I'm sorry I lost it. Love you, buddy. I won't do that again, okay? Okay. Are we even? I'll let you beat me the next we wrestle. Just once. This week we are still using derivatives to figure out limits but now, we're looking at limits that end in indeterminate form. This is called L'Hôpital's rule. I just watched the Prootr Co fight. Hey, Sport. I just woke up late. Can we talk about this at the gym? No. Don't give me that. What gives? Ricky was supposed to fight Mitch Radowski next month in Memphis. Mitch broke his hand yesterday. Serious? Hell, put me in coach. Jett, he's a tough fucking thick neck with 28 fights under his belt. You have three. Come on, anytime, anywhere on a moment's notice, Chief. All right, pussy hole, I'll get into it. All right. Say it, Quinn. Fuck. I'm not going to say it. My mom will kill me. How will she know? Come on. Fuck. Hey, Patrick, that's not how we roll, my man. What did I do? Fine. Hey, kid. Guess what, you get to ride the bus home with Gerry today. Wait. What? No chance. No. What do you mean? You love the bus. Not anymore. I don't. Tanner Van Holt rides it now. You think I'm bad? Yes. He said Santa isn't real. Get out. Last week, you threw Jerry's thermos right out the window. Buy you a new one, Gerry? Come point him out to me. Tanner, Van, Holt, number 71. Hey, Tanner. I'm Jett. Yes, I know who you are. You threw Gerry's thermos off the bus window last week? I didn't know it was his. It was rolling around everyone's feet. Right. Well, I'm afraid you're going to have to buy him a new one, my man. I'm not sure if that's going to happen, Jett. It's not a fucking question. Get him a new fucking thermos. All right, man. You got it. You got that? Yes, man. Get the fuck out of here. Hey, Jett. You think you could have handled that a bit more diplomatically? Diplomatically? Yes, like an adult? You'll never understand. I understand a jerk when I see one. Can you go ask Tanner nicely if he'll buy Gerry a new thermos? Can you do that? Yes. You're better than that. Control the head. Control the head. Grab your shirt. First triangle. Good. God. Nice. Hey, Sport. Memphis. Three weeks. Get psyched. Are you ready, Kareef? You went through a stoplight with an open container? Nice example you're setting for your kid. Well, you got to learn how to drive with an OC at some point, sport. Okay. Rule number one, always keep your roadie stove between your thighs. When a cop pulls you over, his first glance is always the cupholder. Rule number two, never sip while flying through an intersection. You got a lot of liberal homos out there who'd love to call 911 on your ass. Don't let liberal homos see me drinking while driving. Got it. Rule number three, before each swig, you check your side views and your rear views. Rule number four, in case of an emergency, hide the said beer in son's pocket. I'm going to fucking kill that bitch. Motherfucking shit. Of course. Are you kidding me? Yes, sir. Any day. Thank you, sir. Yes, sure thing. Again, my bad. Yes, sir. Okay. Rule number five, with Cash Boykins, the previous four rules don't apply. All right, Sport. Come on in, Chief? Two minutes? Come on, man. Explain the deal. Get her pumped. Say hi to your other son? The shit I do for love. Jett. Hey. I've got a surprise. Quinn, how's it hanging? Good. Susie. Cash. Look, you two need to talk. Will you both please take the high road? I have, hundreds of times. The low road's better. Jett, can you get a bath going for Quinn? He's stinky. No, I'll put on deoderant. No, you need to soak, okay? Come on, Quinn. Let's go. All right, guys. Got anything to drink? Just Chardonnay, in the fridge. For the love of Christ. I can remember your Two-Buck Chucks smelling like cat piss. You don't remember a lot of things. Oh, fuck me. I walked right into that one, didn't I? What do I owe this pleasure? Got Jett a fight for the 28th. WFA 247 in Memphis, third undercard against Tricky Ricky Promotor Co. Remember him? Jesus. Number 12 contender, should be a solid litmus test for him. Can he beat him? Well, his kickboxing certainly improved. His grappling's solid. What about his judo? Fuck judo. What he needs is a jab. So find him one. Does he need to miss school? No. No, shouldn't. Two hours with Kareef before and after school should suffice. How much? WFA minimum, $10,000 a show, another $10,000 for a win. I may be able to bump that up to $15,000. I could front you $10,000 now if you need help with Quinn. We're not a fucking daycare service, Susan. Yes. That was my fault, I'm sorry. I knew you were incapable, but I rolled the dice anyway. All right. Well, I'll have Patty wire the 10Gs into your account tomorrow. You're welcome, Susie. Fuck you, Cash. Boykins, take a seat. I'm now pissed. Fucking stinks like a bitch. Fuck it. Your inside leg kicks are killing him. He opened himself up to a traingle chop. I know. I fucking blew it. If he does it again, you put him to sleep. Time is up. Let's end this shit now. - Go, baby. Let's go. - Let's go. How did you score round two, Tyron? I had that as a- - Keep your focus. Stay focus now. big round for Boykin. Barely minimal. It's 10, nine, nine. Come on, Champ. Not this. It's been a very close fight so far. It may very well come down to round three here. Moleko is very fast. That's a fast one. I know. That's the kick. He's going for a heel hook. What an escape by Boykins. Get this motherfucker. Counter. Big counter. He's looking to- - I think it's a counter. Ground and pound. I think he's back up. They are eating some huge shock to this fight. Look at this, a luminary rope. Rolls right into his shoulder lock. Over plot. Now, we do a triangle. Come on. There you go. He takes the advantage. Now going for the body. He's taking punches but he's dishing him out as well. Oh my... Going back and forth. Just exhausted to end round three. It could come down to a split decision. The fight was very close. Even that round, it was a thing. What a fight. This is really too close to call here. Now, you got that baby. It's all you. The judges are taking their time. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a split decision. Judge Watson scores the fight 29-28. Boykins. You're a smart man. Judge Goldstone scores the fight 30-27 for Motoco. You are a cheat. Come on. Nobody likes you. Judge Max scores the fight 29-28. The winner, the Pride of Ramses High. Jett Boykins is your winner. You showed a lot of heart there, champ. Unbelievable fight. That's what I'm talking about. I didn't doubt it for a second. Come here. I didn't doubt it for a second. Thank you. Good day. Good stuff. That was super, Jett. Good for the soul, Jerry. Your ball buster. Have you seen what's on chapter 15? Point conversions. That's what I live for. Now, you care about conversions. You're on autopilot girl. What do you mean autopilot? You didn't hear? Kim got accepted into West Point. Damn. Is there anything you can't do? Don't get me wrong. I'm thankful to you both. You built a $5 billion Goliath. As a result, many of us have created a level of wealth behind our wildest dreams but in the last five years, you think in addition to owning the WFA, you own its fighters. I don't blame you for thinking like that. We've allowed ourselves to be owned. You got five bill. Well, 95% of your fighters under your banner have very little savings, health insurance that only covers injuries, no pension funds. You participate in revenue sharing. Yes, we do, Jamie. Revenue sharing amongst the 512 WFA fighters under contract is 8%. NFL owners and players split revenues 50-50. When you look at it like that, boys, the WFA is a nice form of slavery. I have heard enough of this shit. Calm down, Jamie. We fighters, we come from very little means, Rami. When I was in sixth grade, Sherman Steel kicked my ass. I didn't come home for three motherfucking days because I knew my old man would beat me 10 times worse for, "Losing to a nigger." I remember my first MMA paycheck. $1850. I went out, bought myself a 12'er of Nati light, paid my rent, pulled Jamie aside, and said, "God bless you, Messa. Thank you, thank you." You are such a prick. I can't... Goddammit, the truth hurts, doesn't it, Jamie? Here's the deal, I own two WFA belts. I bring in three million pay-per-views per fight. Without me, WFA is just three letters in the fucking alphabet. We're a little bigger than that, Champ. Oh, yes? A little. But you are a very important part of the family, very important. Thanks. What do you want, Cash? You gentlemen need to put together a package, full insurance, benefits, pensions, higher revenue sharing, upping the minimums. Cash. I better not want to wipe my ass with it, Rami, because we're this close to organizing a union. I won't get every fighter to join, but I'll get 40%. I'll establish an NLRB board. We'll have elections. Oh, yes, baby. It'll be quite the ass-fucking. Come on, David. You want me to put a little smiling face emoji on it? Sure. Nice job. Okay, I have $20. With that $20, I decide if I'm going to do this right, I need to get my breath fresh," so I bought toothpaste. Toothpaste costs $4.75. I'm going to get a loaf of bread because I need to make a sandwich when I get home, preferably, I like salami. You know what I mean? I don't know about you all. What's your favorite sandwich? Pepperoni sandwich. Oh, you love pepperoni sandwich? That's some good pepperoni. All right, let's get into the problem now. Here we go. $20, right? Everybody see that? Yes. Okay, with that $20, I decide to buy a toothpaste that costs $4.75. With that $4.75, I also decided, "You know what? I'm going to buy some bread that costs $3." How much change do I get back? Go ahead, Quinn. $12.25. - That's right. $12.25. - My man. $12.25. Have a good day. I'll see you guys later. Have a good day. Enjoy it. Get out in the sun. Get some vitamin D. Killing it. Get some vitamin D, boy. I know. I'll come get you in a bit, all right? Okay. You're a good dude, Mr. Stewart. Thank you, Jett. You're a good dude yourself. Hey, I have an old Army buddy whose son wants to get into MMA. Is there any chance we could get coffee. Yes, of course. Anytime. Awesome. You're awesome for that, thank you, man. Hey, do you know Keaton Carmichael? I do know Keaton. I wrote her a letter of commendation. Wait, you went to West Point? No, but after the Silver Star, I was fortunate enough to meet Senator Cummings, and to get into West Point, you need to be sponsored by a senator so. Moving and shaking, Mr. Stewart. Bam, bam. That's how I do it. Are you married? No. Girlfriend? You're starting to scare me. It's not for me. Okay. Okay? I think I got somebody for you. Great, I haven't been out on a date in a long time. Yes? I think everybody wants to roll with you, man. Well, I do know how to roll. You know what I'm saying? I don't mean to sound shallow, but... Don't say it, mom. He's in a wheelchair. Yes, that's what happens when brave men go out to war and get shot, mother. He's good-looking, he's great with Quinn, his penis still works. Tell me you did not ask about his penis. Of course I did. You think I want my mom hanging with some flat tire? Jett William Boykins, tell me you didn't ask about his penis. Penis. No, I didn't. I had Derril ask him. He was subtle about it. Oh, sure. One, two, three, four, four, five. This might be the worse pushups I've ever seen. Well, yes. I learned it from you. Yes? Well, you bend these little arms. Let go of your hand. What are you going to do? I'll kick your freaking ass. Mom, help. Ow. Ow. Damn. Where has this been? I heard Mr. Stewart's stacked. Kampai. Kampai. To a great mom. I don't know about that. Come on, Susan. Just say thank you. Thank you. Yes. I feel like single moms with special needs kids have it the hardest. It's been quite a ride. Yes, I know. Yes? Yes. How much do you know? I know everything. It's my job to. Has Quinn ever talked to you about it? No. I mean, honestly, I don't think he remembers. Do you have discussed it with Jett? Tidbits here and there. He doesn't remember the big stuff. You know when Jett- -Set us up? Yes. When he set us up, I googled you. No. Yes. I totally did. You were a top-ranked tennis player. Hard to believe, right? Look at me now. What are you talking about? You look amazing. You do. Thank you. You are grounded, young lady. What? Hey, no excuses. Pee in this cup. No phone for a week. So? It was nice. Thank you. No problem. I love you. I love you too, mom. Hey. Come here, little guy. Come here. Come on. Show me what you got. Show me these tough hands. All right, one, two, three. Show me the hands. Show me the hands. What's it like being a Stewardess? Are you afraid of flying? No, I really enjoy it. I get to- - All right. Stand there. Stand there. Put your hands up. Remember? Hands up. No. What are you doing? You're not paying attention. Listen to me. One, two, three, come on. What's wrong? Focus. One, two, three. No. You're laughing. What is that? What is that? That's not what I taught you. This tastes like shit. Come on. Pay attention. No. What are you doing? You're not listening to me. Pay attention. I don't want you growing up to be a pussy. Come on, pussy boy. I'm going to fucking kill that bitch. Motherfucking shit. What the fuck? You're trying to kill him. You're trying to kill him. Do you remember that? Do you remember? Because I fucking do. You little motherfucker. I don't fucking need you anymore. I'm not helpless. Fuck you, man. I don't fucking need you. You just shut your own fucking throat, bitch. Quinn. Quinn. Cash, stop. Cash, relax. Stop it. Relax, man. All right. I'm good, I'm good. Get him out of here. Get him out of here. Everybody, time to go. Jake. Jake. Why did I black it out? I remember him hitting you, and the police, I just didn't remember why. Maybe you wanted to forget. Patty, love it. How far are you willing to go with this? Pay me 100 grand for the entire video, and you'll find out. Fuck. You piece of shit. What the fuck? Cash. You're trying to kill him. You're trying to kill him. Do you remember that? Do you remember? Because I fucking do. You little motherfucker. I don't fucking need you anymore. Did you know there's a news van? Yes, I know. Come in. We've been here ever since it went viral. You have vocab on Wednesday and biology's on Friday and your written assignment is in this folder. It's pretty self-explanatory. Thank you. Where did he come from? He just crashed. He was up all night. All the online stuff sent his anxiety through the roof. He's so sweet. I just love him. I'd kill for those lips. The hair is what gets me. I've tried every gel known to man and still can't figure it out. Welcome to Holland. What? Welcome to Holland, the poem. You have to read it. It was written by a mother whose son has Down's, I'm paraphrasing here. When a woman is getting ready to have a baby, it's like planning a trip to Italy. She was excited. She buys six guidebooks and plans a trip to the Vatican, the Colosseum, a winery in Florence. When she arrives, the pilot says, "Welcome to Holland." She's like, "Holland? No, no, I signed up for Italy. There's no way in hell I'm staying in Holland." But she has no choice, that's where she landed. She learns Dutch and she buys new guidebooks. She visits the windmills and sees a few Rembrandts. All the while, all her friends are just living it up in Italy, bragging about how great it is. She realizes that she can't let it get to her. She can't spend time mourning over Italy because then she'll never be free to appreciate the true beauty of Holland. I'm not sure if I love that poem or despise it. Yes, me neither. I appreciate it. I appreciate you. Thank you, Keaton. I mean it. You're welcome, Jett, I mean it. Look, Cash, I don't know who leaked it and I don't care. You don't know who leaked it. You must think I'm fucking stupid, Rami. You don't think I know what goes on in my own camp? I just follow the numbers. As do I, which is why I thanked the bitch before I fired her. Let's talk cabbage. Okay. 50 million upfront, guaranteed. What are we looking at? Five million pay-per-views, six? Jamie is probably still jerking off to YouTube. I can't pull it out. The catch, Rami? The catch is you drop this union nonsense, pensions, healthcare, all that. Forget it. Come on, Cash, you honestly want to spend the next 10 years of your life in court flying back and forth to LA. I will never allow a union, not now, not ever. I only want five million upfront. If word ever leaked out to my fanbase that I was guaranteed 50 mils, 25% wouldn't buy the fight out of principle alone. I want half of everything else. You're insane. You're asking me to fight my own son, you fucking goat roper. Half the gate, half the merchandise, half all pay per view, and access to the books. That's the deal, decide now. Yes or no? Up to you, pal. Keep smiling, Rami. Please tell me you're not doing this. Doing what? Fighting Jett. I'm done. What? I'm so fucking done with you. I'm done. How are you done, Jade? He's your son, Cash. Hey, how are you done? Divorce done? You better fucking answer me. How are you done? Cash, you're hurting me. This will be the last fucking mistake you ever made. Are you threatening me? Oh, it's not a threat, baby. It's a fact. If you're smart, you'll learn the fucking difference. I'm sorry. He offered us half, baby, of everything. We'll make $100 million on this fight alone, maybe even $200. Jade. Good evening. Welcome to the Yard. We've got some great specials today. Hello, Susan. Hey. You've been offered another fight. Child Services should lock me up for even mentioning this to you. Tell me. Boykins versus Boykins. God. How much? $200,000. Holy crap. Did he agree to it? You can't do this. What do you mean? Of course, I can do it. I can't in good conscience. Look, mom. I'm 18, I can do whatever I want. Jett, you're not thinking about the ramifications. It's $200,000, mom. He can kill you, baby. Stop. I know him too well. After that video and all the shit he's taken on social media, he wants to kill you. Mom, I'm his son. He's a psychopath. Please, sweetheart, for me. Just give yourself one more year. I mean, you are a child. There will be other opportunities like this. I promise you. What if there's none? Then this wasn't meant to be- -No- ...in the first place. ...no, no. Fuck. Please don't do this. No. This isn't about you, mom. It's not about you and it's not about Quinn. For once, it's about me. I didn't think I'd see you again. That makes two of us. I bet your head is spinning in a hundred different directions right about now. Yes. I was just listening to a guy on a podcast, he called you insane. He's got me pegged. I'm here because I wanted to thank you, Ms. Malek, and all my teachers who've bent over backward for me. That's what makes this so hard. I really want to graduate and someday go to college, but I don't know how to make it all work right now. Don't drop out, Jett. I'm missing my semester finals. Take them after you win. Look, I'll take care of the powers that be on this end. You just take care of business on yours. Good? Thank you. You know all the great mathematicians were insane? Maybe that's how you approach this. You have one very difficult problem in front of you. Solve it. Hey, grab a pen and paper. Yes, I'm ready. 429241017. Who am I calling? That's a closed number. The only one who will beat you there. I'll see you in Vegas. Motherfucking Kareef hooked it up, baby. Lovely guy. Jett. You're joking, right? Claude. Truly. No, no, no. I'm a hugger. You better get used to it. You're hungry? Yes. All right, come inside and we'll get you set up. Let me help you, give me your bag. Thanks. This way. Give me your phone, please. You'll see it in one month. This way. Voila. Smells good. Nice. Bon appetit, guys. Are you scared? Yes. For two decades now, Cash Boykins has been one of the most polarizing athletes in all of sports. He's not a modern-day slice of Americana. He's the whole pie. Why this fight? Why your own son? For the money? Revenge for that post? Or does it go even deeper? Look, Jett has a lot of talent and he's got a bright future. But he won't improve unless he fights the best. Unfortunately, that's me. The Apocalypse is finally upon us. We are just a few weeks away from what promises to be the most controversial fight in WFA history, between Cash Boykins and his 18-year-old son Jett. How about that, partner? Syd, honestly, I believe we've officially reached a new low in this great country you call America. I don't care how much money he's- - You don't care about how much money, what planet are you from? Fathers don't fight sons under any circumstance. This is family. Family who don't much like each other right now. Here's the deal, the fight game is all about the Benjamins. Sure. It's about money. If there is a specific demand, you go after it. Jett's fight against Promotico, did you even watch it? I did. I did. Thank you, Syd. Yes, but Tricky Ricky Promotico ain't Liquid Cash Boykins, the Slayer. Cash is the greatest fighter in the history of the sport and this boy has a zero percent chance of beating the king. Zero percent would mean there's zero appeal, which means there would be zero reason to do this fight. That's not the case. Keep in mind. Cash's fight against Evil Fate the Terrible did about $2.7 million buys at $79.95 a buy. Now they're estimating that this bet will do over $6 million buys, at $89.95 a pop. Benjamins, baby. Yes, Syd, I think you've had a few too many tokes of Colorado's finest. Not this morning. I will tell you this, every high school kid will not ask their parents, they will demand that their parents buy this fight. The video has already gone viral. 50 million views. Jamie, about that 200 grand, add a zero. You be good for mom. I love you, buddy. I love you, too. Come here. I'll be back Sunday morning. Will you still be here? Come on, Jade. Cash, I warned you before we got married. Zero tolerance. We had a contract. I know. I'm sorry, babe. Me too. Kareef? Hey, Jade. How you doing, little man? Kareef. Just wait until I get back, please. I love you. See you guys. What was it like to beat Cash? Do you really want to know? Yes. You're going to find out soon because you're going to beat this guy, right? You must fight smarter, take emotion out of it, stick to the plan, and you will outwit him. Yes? Yes. Hey, is it true the Rock's coming tomorrow night? That'd be sweet. Any of you guys seen Skyscraper? That is a fucking masterpiece man. Feeling good, Cash? My balls are in this robe, big time. Cash, do you feel any remorse for fighting your son? Shit no. Every 18-year-old kid out there deserves a good old fashioned ass whooping. It builds character. He's been saying that exact same line to me since I was three. Cash, the way you're talking to him, the fact that you're already drinking, it only reaffirms- - You know what it reaffirms, honey? It reaffirms that I could really use a handjob right about now. Cash, that's sexual harassment. Lick me where I shit, Jamie. Now that's sexual harassment, people. Hey, in his defense, the abuse stuff was 10 years ago. He paid his dues. That doesn't change the fact that he's an absolute piece of crap, so you can feel free to sue his ass. My baby is so sweet, ain't he? You won't be thinking that tomorrow night. I can guarantee you that. Is Sport going to give me a licking? I could have knocked your sorry ass out four months ago, chief. I don't remember it going down like that. Yes, you don't remember yesterday. This is true. Hey, barkeep, get this guy another Bloody Mary. Good idea, Barkeep. Make it a double. Next? Come on. Daddy needs shoes. No, you won. We won. Yes, go ahead. Take it out. Let me get it. On a four, on a five, on a six, on an eight and throw all these the hard way, Oh boy. What the fuck is this? Shit. Sir, could you please? Shit. Sorry, baby. Wow. Now, this is some great shit we got going on in here baby. Right? I'm Cash. Hi, Cash. How are you doing? I'm Dan. Dan? Tell me, Dan. How is it you can see the dice from all the way down there? Cash, go to bed. Hey, look at all these little cute $25 chips, Susie. You two want a few bananas? I only got about 50 left, but hell, they ain't doing me any fucking good. I think you might need those for later. What? Hey, you got that right. I do need these. Do you want to help me out? Because I'm good but I ain't that good. Come here. Let me tell you something. Then she went down on. Do you believe this? I liked it. He's good. He's okay, whatever the hell your name is. Dan. Dan. Oh, cool, man. Do you need a ticket or something for tomorrow night's battle? What the fuck you know about battle? Hey, Jett. Yes? Is "Screw you" bad? Yes. What about "Anal"? Very bad. Have a dessert. Heck, yes. Wait, what about my diet? No rules tonight. All right, you can have as much dying sugar as you want, or you can be up late. Okay? Okay. We won't fight till 10 o'clock. My body peaks at 12, so I need to sleep late, understand? I want two chocolate sundaes with whipped cream and Skittles. Yes. This is. Ever heard of a neck crank? I have not. It's the closest thing one human being can do to another before ripping his head off. Sounds fun. You're looking for some fun? Come on up to the Presidential Suite. Jade not making this trip? I think she's leaving me, sport. Oh, good for her. It won't last. She will be back. Don't bet on it. What's Claude's grand plan this time? I can see you two butt-fuckers now watching film, sipping on some Bordeaux, talking socialism. I'm just glad I finally figured out the truth. The truth, huh, and what's that? That you're just a really weak person. You're weak when it comes to Jade, pathetic when it comes to Quinn, mom, but maybe your biggest weakness is yourself. I pray I never end up like you. You won't. Know how I know that? Because tomorrow night you die, Sport. Tomorrow night, I kill you. Okay. , kid. Also fighting out of Birmingham with a record of 38 wins, one defeat, the undisputed Lightweight Champion of the world, the undisputed Welterweight Champion of the world, the Slayer, Liquid Cash Boykins. Come on, Jett. How are we doing? Shake up a little, Jett. Shake up. All right, guys, bring it in. Bring it in, gentlemen. Gentlemen, championship fight here. You both know the rules. If you want to touch gloves, go ahead and do so now. All right then, go back to your corners. Come out on my call. Cash, quick question. My daughter is just done with karate. Can she be next? Go back to your corner. Are you ready to go? - Cash, are you ready to go? - Let's fight. Here we go, Kenny. Father versus son. Man, you could feel the tension right now. Cash comes out strong, looking for that spinning back kick. He's trying to take his head off. Now attacking the body, trying to slow down Jett. Smart strategy. Jett needs to use his distance. That's what he does best. It's hard to do it against an aggressive fighter like Cash though. Looking to counter. Nice front kick. The son hits the floor. He just hit him in the face. Same corner. What the fuck are you doing? Jett trying to go to the ground. Come on. Get up. Cash is not having it. Let's go. Get back to your feet. It's a smart thing. He knows he has the advantage on the feet. Let's fight. He has so much experience with his striking. He's trying to get a little wild. This is going to favor Cash. Big combination there from Cash. He's rocking. Picks him up. Excellent double-legged takedown. This is not good for Jett. This is exactly what happened to the. This is a bad spot to be in. There's only 10 seconds to go here. Let's see if he can secure a position. He could finish it here in round one. Saved by the bell. That was a close call. A huge round for Cash. Tyron, how'd you score that first round? It finished very strong with the elbows, started off strong. I'm going to go with a 10-9. We will see what the judges say. Wow, what a round by Cash. My goodness. Now, listen. Listen to me carefully. Please, don't brawl with this guy. Don't fight with him. Come on, Jett. You got this. What does Jett need to do here to even things up here in round two? Well, Jett needs not to play into Cash's game plan. He was trying to scrawl and brawl by standing in the pocket. That's not the game plan. He needs to use his distance, leg kicks. Get in and get out. Here, we go. Round two. Cash coming out strong again. Very aggressive. Trying to back up Jett Boykins. Jett has to do a better job by sticking and moving, using the distance, getting in, and getting out. Tyron, to your point, he just did it right there. Excellent lateral movement. This is what we didn't see in round one. Oh my God, judo throw. Great reversal there by Jett Boykins. There's his judo. Those are the judo takeouts we expected to see in round one. See if he can limp leg out of this. Cash trying to turn this into a single-leg takedown and Jett limp-legs out of it. Back to the feet. Much better defense there from Jett Boykins this time out. He's keeping him off balance. Nice right hand as well. Jett has enough against the cage. Needs to get that space off the fence. Great wrist control. Beautiful throw. Nice. Not a whole lot of time left here, Tyron. Big kick there by Jett Boykins. Yes, baby, yes. It goes to the body. What an end to the round there from Jett Boykins. You can see his confidence building. Cash looks very frustrated. That's what I'm talking about. That was beautiful. Great. Hey, he went in the corner and listened to his coaches, came out with a brilliant round. Did stick and move, stole the cookie, left the crumb behind. That's what he has to do. I call it one to one. Keep kicking that leg till it cannot stand no more, and we're going to take him to the ground. Stay focused, stay focused and go keep kicking that leg. Absolutely amazing fight so far. let's what round three has in store for us. Here we go, Tyron. That's a cheap shot by Cash. Of course. Why wouldn't Cash do that? He's known for this. He's foot-stomping. That is not illegal, but that is not cool here in mixed martial arts. A big shot. Mr. Referee. Keep fighting. This is not where Jett wants to be. Come on. not able to get control here. He's getting down very low with his face. He's ready for that throw. Second bounce. Cash is driving the cage. Stop driving the fence. Yes, that's another cheap shot. If he turns it into a takedown, that should be a point deduction. This referee is letting Cash get away with some serious rule-bending here. Remember how that feels, boy? I made you, bitch. Come on, come on. Come on. That's right, bitch. You remember where you came from. Sit down. What the hell are you doing? Don't fight emotional. Hey, listen guys. Hey, Cash, if you grab the fence like that again, I'm going to take a point away. Do you understand? You want to lose this fight? So wake up and put yourself together. We're going to go back to the plan. We're going to go back to the kick and the footwork and stay focused. I am not a bitch. You stick to the goal, boy. Relax. We're going to take him to the ground again. Look at me. Do you want to win this fight? Okay, so we focus. Keep the distance. Chop down that leg. We just lost that round. Okay, man. You do what you do. We got this, all right? You prepped for this. Let's go. let's go. With Cash top on our scorecards anyway, two to one, Jett Boykins needs to come out strong. Beautiful kick to the head. Okay, that's it. Stop right here. Stop right there. Time out. Go to the mutual corner right there. I told you last round, grab the fence again, I'm going to take a point away. I got to take a point away. That's one point deduction. Red corner. Grabbing the fence. That is going to help Jett. Jett will be up in this round here. Stay right there. All right, guys, We're going to restart this fight. Let's clean it up, gentlemen. Are you ready to go? You ready to go? Let's fight. That is going to give some confidence back to Cash as we start this round again. A big knee there. Get off me. Fuck. Go back to your corner. This is it right here. You ready to go? You ready to go? Let's fight. Fifth and final round here. Tyron, it's do or die for both of these men. What a combination by Cash. Jett's starting to score some combinations. Don't stop with the lyrics, go to the fucking face! Listen to your fucking trainer. Come on, finish him. Do what he fuckin' tells you bitch. Rip his face. Do it. You fucking pussy. Stop, stop. No. No, no, no, no, no. He's blocking the referee. I hope Jett is okay. This is not a good moment right now. We see very little movement from Jett right now. Jett, get up, man. Yes. This is a scary moment right now. What's going on? Jett. Get up, man. Hey. Hey, Jett. I'm sorry, ma'am. I can't allow you... Guys, guys, let her in. Let her in. Jett, Jett. Please, Jett. Please, please. Please. Jett, baby, wake up, please. Please, please. His eyes, his eyes just moved. Jett, are you okay? Did I hear a loss? Can we get a stretcher, please? Hey, Jett, Jett, Jett. We cannot take any risk. No, please. I'm okay. Stretcher. Mom, mom. I'm fine, tell him. I'm fine, mom. Mom, I'm okay. I'm ok.. I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud. Take a look around me. Taking pages from a magazine, been looking for the answer ever since we were seventeen. You know the truth can be a weapon to fight this world of ill intentions, a new answer to the same question, how many times will you learn the same lesson? I think they got it all wrong. This is what we came for, and we couldn't want it anymore. Could never turn back now, got to leave it all on the floor. Been dreaming of the payoff, through the struggles and the trade-offs, write in truth heading on the way up, tell them the truth, but they think it's just made up. I think they got it all wrong. We just got to hold on, and on, and on, and on 'cause we're going to be legends, Eventually, they're going to know who's right. To make a stand you got to win the fight. Can't stand the heat, then just stay out the light for you might never make it out alive. You gotta live without the columbines. Let everybody hear your battle cry. Yes, we're going to be legends, going to get their attention. What we're doing here ain't just scary. It's about to be legendary. We're going to be legends, going to teach 'em all a lesson, got this feeling that we're so sweet caring. It's about to be legendary. Legends.
