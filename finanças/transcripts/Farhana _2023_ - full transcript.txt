MAMALLAPURAM, 14 KILOMETRES Idiots. Look at them. Looks like it ended quickly. [sings a famous Hindi romantic song] Come now, Bobby. Is that it? I want her! As if you scored with her all by yourself! Hey! Hey! Bobby! Bobby... -Hey, Bobby! Bobby! -Hey, Bobby! Hold it, Bobby! Dev! ICE HOUSE, CHENNAI 5. TAHAJJUD PRAYER TIME There, there... Okay. -When are you seeing the doctor? (Urdu) She does it everyday when dawn breaks. Don't delay it any further. Hurry. -Okay. (Arabic) Greetings. -(A) Greetings. The auto will be here soon! Tie Abhitha and Muthaleef's shoelaces! Breakfast ready? (U) Come on! (U) Get going. Hurry. -(U) Get your bags! (U) Go! -(U) Go! Bye! -(U) Go quickly! (U) You kids travel safe. Study well. -(U) Bye. Hello? Greetings! Who do you want to speak to? And you are? Just a minute. Call for you, Farhana! (U) Who is it? -(U) Someone named Jenny! Hello? It's Jenny, Farhana! From Patrick's School! Hey, Jenny! How are you? -I'm good. I was working abroad. Just got back. Why? -My marriage! That's why! I've invited all my school friends. Send me your WhatsApp number. I'll send you an invite! I'll drop by if I can. Don't get me wrong. -Don't take the trouble. I'll give my husband's number. -"Husband's number?" Why? I don't have a phone. What? You don't have a cell phone? What are you saying? No. I don't use one. How do you live without one? His phone has WhatsApp. Here's the number. -Fine, tell me. Hey, Bootsman! Why keep staring at that store? 45 years ago, that land was on sale for 4,000 rupees. Your father refused, as he didn't want to take a loan to buy it! He could've taken a loan and bought the place! Don't get started, ma'am. Pinpointing blunders can be vexing. Got any hill bananas? Yes. Knew you'd want some for your granddaughter. Saved it for you. Don't you have any branded slippers? Isn't this a branded slipper? I don't want it. Fees defaulter list! K. Abhitha! Your term fees is yet to be paid. Tell your parents to pay it soon. Okay? Here. If Bhai is in need of money, tell him he can ask me. We'll figure something. I've never seen him or his father take a loan from anyone in this bazaar. We'll see. Here you go. He's bound to come someday. When the cow weakens, scavenging crows delight indeed! I need money for the school fees, father-in-law. We'll take a loan... Anyone who takes a loan in their life... ...will wake up insane in the afterlife! (U) Can't take loans, Kareem. Don't tell them about this. Return it soon. How about... You try finding another job... Shall I ask Ameen Travels for a job at Saudi? Abdullah went there to be a driver. He texted about how his passport got seized and he got pummelled. At least he is unmarried. (U) We have three children. Am I educated? To work in an office in a three piece suit? If not the shoe shop, the bag shop. If not the bag shop, the scrap shop. There won't be enough money, Farhana. (U) Money kept here seems missing. (U) The rent money? (U) Took some for a friend's marriage, dad! (U) Dad? (U) I... ...am going... (U) ...to look for a job. (U) Job, it seems! Job! If you're not capable enough to provide, even your wife and kids will disown you! If no money comes in from the shop, everyone sprouts wings! Slippers from my shop. It will wear out but won't rip apart. 'O Radiance' 'Come before my eyes' 'O Radiance' 'This is a day of ecstasy' 'Memories of rain showers... Streamers of festive flowers...' 'Swaying desires within shed drops of melody' 'O Radiance' 'Come before my eyes' 'O Radiance' 'This is a day of ecstasy' -Hi, Farhana! What happened to you? -You just got married, right? I got married ages ago. 'For time...' '...is but an empty papyrus' 'Upon it, someone will sketch...' '...an image, just for me' 'Like dew drops in the woods, I fell, a little' 'As a birdsong caressed my heart, I found refuge' 'The sun, to me...' '...is the news that my window bars bring' 'When the moon surfaces...' '...without letting it drown, my river holds it high' 'Memories of rain showers... Streamers of festive flowers...' 'Swaying desires within shed drops of melody' 'O Radiance' 'Come before my eyes' Hey, Farhana! Come here! 'O Radiance' Nithya, this is Farhana. My friend from school. 'This is a day of ecstasy' -This is Nithya. My college senior. She just asked if there were any job openings. There's a walk-in interview on Monday. Call this number. Bye! I'll get going. I'm off. How are you heading back? We've booked a cab. All good, then. Bye. -Bye. Hey, look over there! The colors looks fantastic. She asked me to come for an interview on Monday. - Red, green, blue, white... - You're wrong! - You're wrong! Wrong! Wrong! - You always say I'm wrong. Farhana? You're up next. It's hard to clear interviews at the drop of a hat. These days, they only hire youngsters. A big company too. (U) Don't get worked up. They hired me. Let's go. Dad's angry. Must I not work for the sake of my kids? (U) Only we are of two minds about it. All other educated people work, don't they? Why, even our people work after finishing their studies. Just that there's a lot of shady news about the IT industry. (U) Sister! If one is to go the wrong way, it can happen right at home! Allah is always with us. If we make a mistake accidentally or on purpose... ...(U) He is always with us. You go above and beyond the call with your prayers. Allah will always be by your side. It's not that we don't trust you. (U) But the kids... (U) Not a problem. I'll take care. (U) Will they let you pray there? They're absolutely fine with it. As long as I meet my targets... Hey! They have no problem with me praying at work. All they expect is for me to achieve my targets. (U) How much, brother? Hadhiya! -What? There's milk on the stove. Heat it up and give it to Nabha at 11! (U) The sugar is next to it! Like I don't have milk or sugar at my house! Abhitha will be back from school at 3 o'clock. (U) Oh God! Get going! I got this! The baby is with my sister. There's rice and chicken curry for lunch. Farhana? (U) I'm off. Hi! -Hi. Congratulations! -Thank you. My first day. -All the best. Was the commute fine? Coming without my husband and kids is... -"Is?" Is it fun? As far as we're concerned, if we put down even a small portion of our load, it's fun. You are not 'bank staff'. Do not say you are 'calling from the bank.' Say you're 'calling on behalf of the bank'. "Can I speak to you?", is wrong. "May I?", is right. It means, "I'd like to speak to you". We don't want you to talk to the customer. We want you to have a conversation. May I ask you a doubt? Excellent! 'In a rickety house on the Ice House Street...' 'An ascending sky, is Farhana' 'Blooming in the ray of sunshine by the window sill...' 'A woman who finds her shore...' 'Farhana' 'In a rickety house on the Ice House Street...' 'An ascending sky, is Farhana' ''Blooming in the ray of sunshine...' -Lifetime free card, sir. With insurance! '...a woman who finds her shore... Farhana' -The bugger hung up! 'A bird of short strides, is she?' -Party? It's not 'party'. 'Are her wings, mere decorations?' -It's 'partyyyyy'! Balance transfer? Transferring a credit card bill amount to another bank card. Fantastic! 'The universe entire tremors' Every bank statement here is not just a copy of a bill. It's an individual's lifestyle! Their purchasing power! Who are they? What kind of people are they? What do they like? It will show you all of it! To buy land. -To buy an iPhone. To fly with my parents. -To buy an electric scooter. To give my kids a good education. To buy everything they wish for. They mustn't be deprived of anything, like I was. I mustn't be forced to take a loan. That's why I look at this job as a gift from Allah. Target! -Must be met! Come on! Can we do it? -Yes! Shall we? -Yes! Today's target is 500 cards! As of now, we've hit 200 cards. Good job! Take a seat. Priya, Prema and Karthick have hit the ten card milestone. They're about to hit the next milestone! All the best. -Let's see who is today's star performer! Hello? -(A) Greetings. Hello? -(Hindi) Who is it? (H) I... I'm calling from HSDC Bank, ma'am. (H) Go on. (H) A lifetime free credit card... You're a premium customer with us, right? (H) It has a great limit, ma'am. (H) There's free insurance coverage too. -(H) Free, huh? Is that so? (H) Your PAN card number, ma'am? Thank you, ma'am. -(H) Alright. Hey everyone! Farhana made her first sale! Hip hip... -Hooray! 'Farhana' 'Farhana' The database, sir? -Don't call me 'sir'! Call me 'Purush'! My name is not 'Sir'! My name is Purush! Okay, sir. Excuse me, sir. -Don't call me 'Sir'. Call me 'Purush'! Sorry, sir. All the best! -Thank you! Farhana? I'm moving to another department. Bye! -Bye. Incredible incentives in that department. Priya even bought an iPhone! 'Amid a bustling breeze in a buzzing metropolis...' '...you pull the sky down to earth' -Thank you, Purush. Purush! I completed ten cards! 'Rivers that flow into the sea vanish without a trace' 'Here, a river delights by turning into a sea' 'Time turn beautiful... Crowns become yours' 'The heart sings melodies... Dreams come true...' 'A bird of short strides, is she?' 'Are her wings, mere decorations?' 'This butterfly becomes a hawk' 'The universe entire tremors' 'Farhana' 'Farhana' New car? -Yes. How's the new department? -Little hard, but the incentives are great. Please refer me for it. -It won't suit you, Farhana. 'A flower clad in a burqa who returns home in time' 'A glowing fire that shows the way in a dense forest' 'With her kohl-streaked eyes, she works wonders' 'Bees and beetles seem to hum new tunes' 'Her dark hair dances with the wind... Time joins along in a jig...' 'The river takes a new turn and a hundred answers emerge...' 'A bird of short strides, is she?' 'Are her wings, mere decorations?' 'This butterfly becomes a hawk' 'The universe entire tremors' 'Farhana' 'Farhana' Nithya... Don't get mad. Can I shift to your department? Please? It won't suit you, Far. Why? Isn't the Card section doing well? Yes, but incentives are high only in your department, right? Ah! You want more incentives, huh? Hey, Bootsman. How are you? It is said, "Some say many prayers to Allah and still steal hay for their cattle", yes? Those who steal seem to live a satisfied life! But the ones who only pray? Even if it's just a morsel of food we need... ...this shop isn't able to earn us even that much! What to do, Bootsman? -Slip it on, ma'am. Online ordering and door delivery is at the click of a phone. But you were able to get three girls married with this shop alone! Here, Bootsman. This is for you. See you, son. -(U) Thanks, ma'am. Nabha! When will you do the surgery? Why do you delay? Understand just how serious this is. As she was born prematurely, she was put on a ventilator. Having been there for long, her lungs are filled with water. Hence, she finds it hard to breathe. We need to operate on her chest. A girl child, too. Things will get complicated as she grows older, if you're careless. Put her on a nebulizer. The sooner we do the surgery, the better. Can I take a loan? You can only do that after six months of service. I'm sorry. Go and pay the fee, Kareem. Hurry. When it comes to kids, there's no good or evil, Bootsman. Lord Allah will understand. Why do you have such a long face? It's not like the shop is mortgaged! You've just taken a loan. After doing the tests, meet me in two weeks. If I climb an inch, I fall a foot, Nithya. How many times do I tell you? You are a religious person. No one can do it all. I was told that I wasn't capable of doing my present job. Please, Nithya. Gave her all the facts? Yes I have, Sam. It will be very tough. Besides salary, you'll have thrice the incentive. I'll definitely achieve my targets. If you join, you must stay for a week. No shuffling between teams. Really? Hello. This is '56565 Friendship Chat'. We welcome you to the world of friendship. Hi, friend. My name is Shweta. How about you? Hi. I'm Karthik. Nice name, Karthik. What do you do, Karthik? -Never mind that. What is your age? How is my age of any relevance to you? 56565. What are your hobbies, Karthik? Hugging... kissing... What are you wearing, Shweta? A chudi... And underneath it? -Well... What one usually wears underneath a chudi. I don't know what one wears under a chudi. You don't know, huh? Tell me what color it is. -No. Very well. Shall I guess? White? No. Not white. Blue, purple... Black? Yes. -Oh, Shweta... Black is such a turn-on. Really? Turn-on, you say? You like it a lot, huh? I seek the forgiveness of Allah! White, blue, purple... Black? Why bathe at this hour? What size is available? Nothing large? Any small sizes? "White?" "Black?" O Allah... (U) It's so late! What about the kids? Your sister made breakfast. Aren't you going for work? What happened? You never sleep without 'tahajjud' (night prayers). (U) Any trouble at work? No. I'm in customer support, right? Some customers come off as either harsh or inappropriate. (U) Very hard to handle. That's how customers are. I fit slippers on the feet of customers at the shop. It isn't wrong. It's a job. But if I fall at their feet outside of work, it's wrong. There's no better service to Allah than to work honestly and with dignity. What if the customers speak in a way that makes me angry or disgusted? "I like it. I don't like it. This is good. This is bad." With such small talk, they'll move on to another shop. And we'll get new customers. That's the nature of business. There's no need to get disturbed by taking their words to heart. This is a friendship chat. Part of the mobile's value added services. Twenty rupees per minute. "This is 56565! We heartily welcome you!" "For a male friend... For a female friend..." "...press two." The caller will speak in any which way. But you needn't talk. Just say 'Mmm' and 'Yes' to what they say. No need to respond emotionally or seriously. In here, we are living machines. We need to make him open up to us. The longer he talks, the more is our incentive. All calls will be recorded. They do random checks for quality control. No matter what, never reveal your name, address, or phone number. If you do, you'll be fired. Why are they so lewd? What is lewd? Did he physically harass a woman in the street? He didn't, right? He has needs. And the means to fulfil it. So, he pays money for it. The ones on the other end could be good or just ordinary people. Who are they? What do they get from it? A high. The callers aren't those who can't score with women. The deepest thoughts they can't share with their wives... ...they spill to faceless strangers. Committed relationship turns boring. They have a need for a non-committed fantasy relationship. But must there not be some control? Should we consider urine to be bad and control it, we'll only fall ill. At times, you must find a way to be rid of certain things! If my family finds out, they'll kill me. They'll only know if you tell them. It's not you who is speaking. It is a character. This is an act! Your real self has nothing to do with it. Try it for a week. If not, Sam will get pissed. Tell me, friend. 56565 Chat heartily welcomes you. What is your name? Shanmugam. I got a message. Excellent, friend. Go on. How old are you, babe? May I call you Maragatham? Sire... "Sire"? God dammit, don't call me that! Do I sound like an old bag? -No... You said 'Maragatham', yes? Maragatham. -Yeah! My Maragatham... ...would be as fair as snow. If you pinch her cheeks, she'd bleed. That face was always so bright. Those eyes, those lips... they're still etched within my eyes. Does your... Would dirty talking alone satisfy a man? Having a woman on the other line alone would suffice. He'll be floored! He can fantasize it any way he pleases! Some get a real kick out of it. Some kick... The love life of an average Indian mostly takes place in his mind! His imagination is what turns him on! Everyone who speaks to him here is a Sunny Leone or a Mia Khalifa. Who are they? Even if a caller shows up in front of you... ...neither of you will recognize one another! Before and after... ...we'd chat for a long time. Do you like it soft or wild? What is 'soft'? What is 'wild'? This is a friendship chat. Is that how you talk to your friends? A friend, indeed... with benefits. "My age?" Yes, I'm 22. I have a girlfriend. Nice! What does she do? She works at my wife's company. I can't forget it. The sound of those anklets... ...still ring in my ears. Bye! -Bye! I have a wife, Isha. But she isn't... Oh, no! As expected, how is it they always ask only about color and size? This is the only thing in this world that requires the least language. By 'color'... "Language", huh? Just the effect is enough! My friend bought it! -Sofia? It's my son's birthday. You made it? Thanks, Far. -Yes. Thank you. -Yes. I love to party! A young girl. -You know what? But she's sure of herself. -It was so funny! She faces everything bravely. And having fun too! Say she doesn't worry much about anything! Hey! Are you a kid? Why are you quiet? Like you talk for nothing! You get paid, right? Do you know the kind of company other callers have given me? Wretch! Way to kill the mood! I heartily welcome you to 56565 Friendship Chat. Tell me, friend. How are you doing? Hanging in there. Thank you. How are you doing? What's your name again? Isha. I'm doing good. Tell me, friend. What are you up to? A cigarette burnt itself so as to satisfy me. Without a hint of selfishness. That's a life too, isn't it? I was bidding it a fond farewell. So... How's life going? That's another way of saying, "Wrap it up, man. I have to go", yes? Not like that, friend. You didn't tell me your name. Assume a name you like. A nice name. Ajith, Vijay, Suriya, Dhanush... How can I? -I am a male voice. You are a female voice. That's all. Among all the voices brimming in the wind, we are just two faceless voices. Faceless voices. I asked without thinking. I'm sorry. Go on, friend. What do you wish to talk about? Hello? Hello? I feel a bit down. Felt like talking to someone. You're the first caller who reached out because they are feeling down. Mr.... Male Voice? It's much better to bare your soul to strangers... ...than to those you know, Female Voice. After we speak, we can part ways without a trace. Like taking shade under a tree from the sun for a short while. What is it you want? Since dawn, I've only said eight words. I've been staring at this wall for a long time. I want to talk. I wish to talk to you like how I talk to myself in the dark. Are you married? I thought so! -I didn't mean it like that. An honest question. Don't take it the wrong way. You just said referring to us by voices was enough. Even names weren't needed. You're quite quick with the comebacks! I need your permission to smoke. And... I'm going to have some coffee. What about you? "Coffee"? -Yes. There's coffee at your desk. I got a cigarette in one hand, and coffee on the other hand. Come on! Let's... The coffee might go cold. I forgot! I'm allergic to smoke. Don't blow any smoke my way. Sorry. Do you talk to everyone this way? Do you think sharing a heart-warming smile after a kiss... ...and having a conversation after intercourse... ...happens with everyone, Isha? There's truth in your voice. There's beauty. I can sense you speak from a place between your principles and your professional duty. I like that place a lot. No one has praised me like this. This is all very new to me. The first reactions to a rose would be about its beauty and smell. But when you chance upon a rare, divine flower? Its value is not instantly known. You say a lot of stuff. But of all the callers, you're the most different. "Cigarettes may be small, but by the time we're done with it..." "...it would feel like a lifetime went by." "But like cigarettes, life drains out quickly too." "Thanks. That was pretty comforting." Oh no! (U) Farhana just got back from work. (U) Your mother's here, Muthaleef! Why is she so late? (U) Mom! (U) Look at this. Aunty gave it to me! You said you'd come home early. Everyone was waiting for you! (U) Where were you? I'm sorry, dear. Would you have to work late often? No. O Allah... "But like cigarettes, life drains out quickly too." "Thanks. That was pretty comforting." "Cigarettes may be small, but by the time we're done with it..." "...it would feel like a lifetime went by." "But like cigarettes, life drains out quickly too." How's that? The week's up today, Far. Will you continue? Definitely not. I tried it for the incentive, and I experienced hell. God willing... I'll go back to my old team. This is the 56565 Friendship Chat. Your name? Isha? Isha? Is that you? Isha? Isha? Hello? T... Tell me, friend. This... isn't the Isha I spoke to yesterday. No. It's the same Isha. To me, speaking is like writing musical notes to a tune. The words I speak... The words I wish to hear from you... They all run in my heart as musical notes. Even if there's a slight change in rhythm, I'll know. I'm a little hesitant. Why? Sir? Sorry... Friend? We use the word 'friend' to address every caller. But... ...for the first time, that word meant something yesterday. I couldn't sense it yesterday when we spoke. But on my way back home... ...it felt like I spoke to someone very close to me. After having heard several lewd callers... ...you seemed very different. I can't speak as intimately with you like I did yesterday. At the same time... ...this is my job. So, friend... Go on, friend. If you feel it's inappropriate to talk to me, you needn't talk, Isha. I won't hang up. Let silence flow like a river between the two of us. I can hear silence. There's music in it! There are words in it! There is meaning! If I were to hang up... ...another caller will verbally molest you. Let's avoid that. Do you really love my voice? Yes. When I wear a T-shirt, I don't wear a bra. I'm a naturist. What's he listening to by himself? I can't hear a thing! Only he can hear it, huh? Is the river flowing? You can hear silence. It has words. What? I have work to do. Will you two speak or not? 'No talking' also means 'No laughing', right? My throat hurts from not having spoken to anyone. Messages kept coming. On a whim, I called this chat service. On the other end, was you. Exactly the kind of person I wanted to speak to. Even down to the voice! Isn't this the magic of life? Only after I got here, did I know such a world exists. It was shocking. They had no patience to talk about anything else. Such haste! So perverted! Only the voices were different. But everyone was the same! Yesterday... Only when you called in, did I learn callers like you exist too. I find it very hard here. I won't come to this place from tomorrow. I can't handle it. Please don't say that, Isha. With just two words from you, my heart melted and felt much lighter. Your voice felt like a helping hand to someone stuck in a well. It has great character. It has a strong presence. Like hearing a chiming bell from a temple uphill. I trust we shall speak again tomorrow. "Your smile is beautiful, Isha. Keep smiling." "It's not just germs and diseases that go viral worldwide." What? Friendship chat? -"Smiles can, too." Farhana, huh? She's like an elder sister, man! You could say 'crush'. What's so special about her? That voice has great character. It has a strong presence. Like hearing a chiming bell from a temple uphill. Great improvement. You were just a half-wit. Now you're fully nuts! "56565. Friendship." "If you wish to speak to a male friend, press one. For a female friend..." Hello. 5656... "To continue speaking with yesterday's friend..." Hasn't Far come, Nithya? She said she wasn't coming. She's back to her old team. "56565!" "If you wish to speak to a male friend, press one." Hello! Go on, friend! Hello? "To speak to a female friend, press two." Hello? Isha? "Isha"? She doesn't work here. "To continue speaking with yester..." "Isha"? I'm not Isha. "To continue speaking with yester..." "To continue..." "To continue speaking with yesterday's friend..." Hello... Friend? Isha? I thought you wouldn't come again. So did I. You're the only one who stood out among all the other callers. Every rule has an exception, right? Consider it that kind of miracle. Isha... We meet several strangers and have all sorts of conversations. But one face... one voice... feels like it's meant for us. More than half the people in the world have no one and can't express themselves. They keep it all in and die from heart attacks! I don't know who you are on the other end. I don't know your face. It feels like I'm talking to a spirit. So you're calling me a ghost? In that case, I'm a ghost too, right? A conversation between two ghosts. Nice. I never expected you to be back! Despite speaking to a hundred callers who only talk sexually... ...I feel like talking to someone who genuinely feels down. If a few of my words offer comfort to someone... ...let it be. For a long time, I haven't been able to openly talk to anyone about my troubles. Shall we go? Caller waiting. What? You didn't hang up? No... I said I was on break. "What if another caller came up?", he said. So... he said he'd wait. I can't handle this. Does only this bloke want to speak or he wants no one else to speak to you? "This bloke?" Far... This is too much! Too much, indeed! -Hey! (U) Don't run, Abhitha! (Arabic prayer) Look! Look how your kid is eating! Kids must be raised properly! Only we can teach them that! We must teach them how to perform the 'farz' prayer... ...and how to perform the 'nafeel' prayer! How can we, when we are simply goofing around? That's how kids get spoilt! (mumbling in Urdu) (mumbling in Urdu) Are you a Muslim, Isha? Must you observe fasting while doing this kind of job? Won't the tongue go dry while talking without water? This is about letting the privileged know the hunger of the deprived. If we observe fasting for a month in the name of Allah... ...both the heart and mind will become pure. Your domestic help has come? -Yes. Rest your eyes. I'll handle this. How long do I ring the bell? Won't you pick up the milk and newspaper? Always on the phone! Like a child! -Fine, please come in. How messy this place is! My bloody fate! God knows what's so great in that phone! On the phone, in the loo, reading paper, having coffee... Heard everything, huh? -Yeah. Enough grinning! Go sleep. At work? Just lie down. Silence flowed like a river, that day. Today? 'Waves of beauty...' -'...in this long refrain' 'Totally new...' -'...is this worship' 'Day and night...' -'...spreads this unending dream' 'In the waves of dreams...' -'...rises this loving question' 'Waves of ecstasy...' -'...in this long refrain' 'I hear a divine melody...' 'With nine shades of emotions...' '...it tries to envelope me' 'A moon on earth? A beautiful reverence? What is she?' 'A dream of love...' Devi theatre is the best movie theatre! -I've gone past it many times. But I've never watched any movies. 'A dream of love...' 'A dream of love...' What do you speak at home? Tamil or Urdu? Both. I really want to gift you something, Isha. "Gift"? For me? If you wish, give it as 'zakat'. -"Zakat"? Your sari is lovely! Donating to the poor. -How is my shirt? Donating a portion of income to the poor. In many places, even near Guindy Metro station, there are several needy people. The clothes you gave were lovely. I saw them. I thought I heard something resembling his voice. Come! 'Until now...' -'...directions unopened open for me' 'The heart's core...' '...without parting, without nearing, blazes away' 'With a smile, she reached out to me, in perfect melody' -'Sketched... -'...belle of art' 'Sweet...' -'...parting of the lips' 'Pulled me in...' -'...with her call' 'Two minds...' -...becoming one' 'Shyly...' -'...floating away' 'Music is born...' -'...and life does dawn' 'The fingers yearn to call' 'In your words, magic, I always see' 'Gathering the rain to shower food...' -'...no end to the rainbird's song of love' 'Running without a pause...' '...time turns into a woman and arrives at my doorstep' 'Are you the eyes I seek?' 'A dream of love...' 'A dream of love...' 'A dream of love...' 'A dream of love...' 'A dream of love...' -I haven't eaten in two days. Sir... Ma'am... Please help... Who gave this? A man came by and said someone named Isha would come give alms. He told us to give her this and say it's from the man she spoke on the phone. Are you Isha? Chocolate! Chocolate! Why are you off so early? There's a meeting. So... Greetings. Hello? Hello? -Hello? I really love role-playing... "If I were to hang up..." "...another caller will verbally molest you." "Let's avoid that." Hey! It's cute! Who gave it? Your husband? No. A friend. "We meet several strangers and have all sorts of conversations." "But one face... one voice... feels like it's meant for us." Do you go to porn sites? They've blocked all the good sites. Alright. Can you do me a favor? -What's wrong? Hey, Far. Give me your Aadhar card. I have a friend who can get you a nice fancy number. Okay? Let's go. New dress, mom! New dress! -Tomorrow. Hold up, Muthaleef! I'll catch you! Farhana! I've ordered six kilograms of meat. Will that suffice? Yes. The mehendi person is coming this evening. Can you just take today off? No. I only get tomorrow off. I need to go. -Jeez! (Mystery about man who ends life after chat with lover on the phone) "Your voice felt like a helping hand to someone stuck in a well." "It's much better to bare your soul to strangers than to those you know." "After we speak, we can part ways without a trace." Says it was a musician in Anna Nagar. How will you even find him there? I know a police inspector named Thilaka. Won't she be able to get an address by checking with the area's police station? I thought you were so naive. You've changed a lot! He's a very nice man. Who knows what bind he's in? I can't help it, Nithya. Fine. Hold on. I'll log out. -I'll head up and get my bag. Okay. Hello? Hello? Isha? How are you doing? -This month's star performer is Roshini! Isha? -Awesome, Roshini! Speak, Isha. Sorry. My phone was broken. So, I couldn't talk. Please don't stay silent like this anymore. Praise be to Allah. I keep hearing your voice a lot more when you're not talking. After that, my guilty conscience does not let me sleep. Don't talk like that, Isha. Isha... Listen... -I thought something happened to you. I thought you died. Isha! I had gone trekking at a remote area. On the way, I dropped my phone and it broke. I tried calling you through another phone, but couldn't get through. It took a while to get back and have the phone repaired. Sorry, Isha. You must've been terrified. I get it. I want to see you. What if something happens and I never get to see you? How can I remember only a voice? Just one time, I'd like to put a face to your voice. It all feels like a dream. Let it remain a dream. I need an image to tightly hold on to that dream. Your face is that image. Why aren't you speaking? Do you not wish to see me? I've frozen that one second you spoke of to ensure it doesn't pass. I don't wish to cross that second. When? Even tomorrow's fine. Oh no... tomorrow's Eid. It's hard to leave the house. Then it's a pious day to me, too! A celebration! I'll be waiting. Can you bring me something you've cooked? Alright. What's your name? Dhaya. Dhayalan. Dhayalan. Oh no! What is it? Hey, Far! -Hey. Happy Ramzan! Don't forget the biriyani tomorrow! It's okay even if it's cold. Bring it! -Okay. Bye! -Sofia... Where are you going? -Just a party with a friend. Don't forget the biriyani tomorrow, Far! Fine. Take care. -Bye! Hello! Hi! -Hi! Where are my new clothes? -Right here! The Halloween costumes? -In the back. See you tomorrow. I'll get going. (U) Biriyani smells tasty! She hasn't let anyone into the kitchen all day! I can't make it to the recording this evening. Please inform Sir. (U) Happy Eid, Farhana! How are you? Doing good? (U) Nice sari, right? (U) How are you, my child? All well? -I'm good. Please come. You wear a burqa to work, right? -Yes. Lovely. -Come in. (U) Hadhiya! Where is Javed? (U) How is Javed? Is he well? (U) Nice sari, Hadhiya! Where did you buy it? Near the mosque? (U) Where's Fathima? (U) In the kitchen? Fathima! -Oh no... damn Narghese... The biriyani smells incredible! Did you make it? (U) When did you make this? Did you do it yourself? (U) How many kilos? It's nice! Please eat before you go. (U) I'll be right back. (U) Great. How's your husband, Fathima? -He's fine. We're going to the beach, Farhana. On a sacred day like this, we're all going as a family. I came thinking we must go there. It came true! Let's go to the beach! (U) Come, everyone! Let's go to the beach! (U) Abhitha! Muthaleef! Where's Hadhiya and Fathima? Hurry up! I have a headache. Can you please take the kids? I'll go meet my parents too. (U) Let's go, everyone! Hello? What is it, Nithya? Sofia.... What happened to Sofia? Sofia is dead! She was murdered. It was one of our callers. She spoke to someone through the chat service... They met and hooked up. He took her to a resort yesterday... -Dev! What the hell is this? All of you get out of here! Get out! "Get out!" Head out. I'll come. What the hell? Are you in love with her? Quit showing off! Bobby... -Shall I tell your wife? Don't push it, Bobby. How can you leave us hanging after inviting us over? You called them here? I came here with you! I trusted you! "I trusted you!" "Why do you people do this?" "You deceived me!" -Get out of here! Get out of here! Listen to me, Bobby... Don't do it, man! -Listen to me... Bobby... -Let it go, man! Don't do it! Bobby! Oh no... Why, man? What the hell? What have you done? I want to see you. Every rule has an exception, right? No one has praised me like this. What's your name? -Javed, sir. What's her name? -Hadhiya. Who is Farhana? -She is. Is she Farhana? -Yes, sir. Check if this is your Aadhar card. Yes. Note it down. (U) Where did you go? Listen to me. There's been a murder. A girl named Sofia is dead. She appears to be of loose morals. It seems the two of them knew each other well. Just an enquiry. If you could tell us what you know, it might help. Please cooperate. -Okay. Who is he? He is Farhana's husband. A woman named Sofia went to a resort at ECR with a few men. Did you go with her? No. How long have you known her? She's been my colleague for a few days. Does she often go out like this? I don't know, sir. Have you gone out like this? Have you seen her boyfriend? No, sir. Do you two hang out together? No. -Show me your cellphone. (U) You have a cellphone? I know, dad. (U) Farhana told me about it. Yes, sir. She bought it recently. Your Aadhar card and the bill for the phone's purchase was in her bag. Did she buy you the phone? No, sir. Why did you go with her to the phone shop? As she's a colleague, I trusted her to give me company. Give me your wife's phone number. I asked you, sir. Give me your wife's phone number. Sir... Sir... 9840... You may have to come to the station for further inquiry. Come by when asked. -Yes, sir. Dad! -(U) Stop it! Please stop! (U) Stop it, dad! (U) I should die! (U) Shameless woman! (U) Let go of me! (U) Let me die! When a cop comes up to my house to ask if my daughter is a hooker... ...I ought to hang myself! No, dad... Please don't... (U) Let go of me! I knew this would happen! I knew this sort of thing would happen! Arrogance stemming from being educated! Arrogance! If the crab gets ahead of itself, it won't stay in its hole, right? You wake up at three and offer prayers, don't you? You must either be true to your heart or just die! Sofia! Age: 25! "Every bird is different, Far." "How high and how far it flies..." Don't forget the biriyani tomorrow, Far! "...varies from bird to bird." "There won't always be someone around to make the save." (A) Greetings. (A) Greetings. (U) Let's go. Hello? -Where are you, Farhana? When are you coming in? -No. I'm not coming in anymore. I'm planning to quit my job. According to the Quran, if one's wife is blamed when innocent... ...and if there's no proof of wrongdoing, she must be protected from that blame. You didn't... ...do anything... ...wrong, right? If you don't go back to work... ...people will think you are at fault. Everyone will assume we forbade you from working because you're guilty. I swear to Allah I gave my Aadhar card in order to buy a SIM card. I'm not educated enough to give you words of advice. You are a responsible person. Just be vigilant. Speaking to bank customers is your job, right? Yes. There's no reason to assume that the callers are good people. We mustn't emotionally connect with them. We mustn't get trapped by them. But if you do get trapped... ...sound and light are good defence tools for women. If you shine this right at his eyes, his vision will be blurred for a while. I've ordered pepper spray to be given to everyone. It must always be in your bag. Once you hang up the phone, cut off all contact with them. Animals that hunt are very cunning. You won't be able to see them until you get very close. And if you do get close, they won't let you go so easily. In spite of all that, if you do meet them or share your personal details... ...we'll send you straight home on the same day. We'll tell the police that we have nothing to do with this. We have enough pressure from the police. If you get something in life you never had before... ...our heart will cherish it. We'd want to go close and touch it. We'd believe it is real. But it isn't! I can't believe this. Did you really go to meet him? I heartily welcome you to 56565 Friendship Chat. Hello? -Isha? Go on, friend. I waited for you for a long time, Isha. This is a friendship chat. Speak only on the phone. I thought you'd come, Isha. I was looking at every woman there, to check if it was you. Like a lunatic! It's okay, friend. We don't always get what we want. Sometimes, we never get what we want... Don't call it quits so quickly, Isha! What happened yesterday left me very hurt. This is my job. Nothing beyond that. Once you hang up, attend to your work. Don't get attached. The fact that you didn't come didn't hurt that much, Isha. But I don't like the way you ignore and disregard our relationship! I looked for you like a lost child that looks for its mother in a crowd! This feels more humiliating than yesterday! I feel ashamed! Didn't you say I was different? For no reason, did I suddenly become a bad man? You didn't even leave home yesterday, yes? You think you're the only one in the world with problems, friend? You definitely didn't come! You don't care what happens to me, right? Listen... -You don't like me. You've decided to keep me at a distance! This is an online chat, sir. To put it in your language, it's like a cigarette. When the fire nears your fingers, you drop it. Or your hands will burn. All good? He's hitting me, aunty! Aunty! I'm at home. In my bed. Your voice is very... You abruptly hang up when they speak. If you do that, how can you meet your target? So far, you've clocked many minutes. You found a way out of this place. Now... find something new. Something else. I don't want this role anymore, Nithya. I can't do it. It feels like what was meant to happen to me... ...happened to Sofia. Please... Be it Cross Sell or Balance Transfer... Please transfer me to either team! Alright. Give me two weeks. I need to speak to HR, Purush and others. Thank you. Did I hurt him too much? It's wrong to assume those on the other end will properly understand... ...something we didn't properly convey. The fact that you waited for him... The Sofia incident... Come clean about it. Alright. I'll talk normally. No need to talk about team transfer for now. Let him find out later. Hello. This is the 56565 Friendship Chat. Hello? What? Is it him? How are you? Hello? Far-ha-na. Farhana. Out of nowhere, you'd make the first move and lead me on... ...and if you don't want to go further, you'd casually chat as if nothing happened! "This is an online chat. Please don't get emotionally attached!" Isn't that right? You're better suited with guys who ask you for your bra and panty size! Don't talk so lewdly to me. I'll tell you everything. This chat office is at the eighth floor of the Patria Building in Guindy. The only woman who leaves that building at 7 PM in a burqa, is you. She hates the smell of my cigarettes. Even if she's all covered up... That face? Those eyes? A thousand pages won't suffice to describe that beauty. She gets on at Guindy Metro and gets off at Government Estate. As it would cost much to take an auto, she takes a share auto. Her house is in a crowded neighborhood in the Ice House locality. She has two sisters and three children. A lot of people around. A deserted footwear store. A father who goes to mosque every day. A husband who sends the kids to school. Right in the middle of all this, is you. Far-ha-na. Did you follow me? If I wanted to find you, I'd have done so on the day we started chatting. I... know you're a good man. "Good man?" What happened? Your burqa is missing. I was in a hurry. I forgot. Isha! Is there an Isha here? "Isha"? There's no one here by that name. Please check this address. You're at the right place. But there's no one here named Isha. We didn't order this. Mom's busted! Mom's busted! Please don't report me to Sam. Don't write it in the checklist. Don't be afraid, sister. We'll talk to Sam and approach this formally. We mustn't spare that guy. Let's not tell anyone. They'll sack me. I'll handle this. What if he was just lying? So far, nothing he has told me has been a lie, Nithya. He doesn't seem like a liar. He's watching me up close. Answer it. Yesterday, I sent over your favorite 'goat-leg biryani', but you refused it. Your husband doesn't know who Isha is, right? Why are you doing this? What is it you want? I want you! Will you marry me? I'll go to the police! Good! Do that! The heart melting conversations we had? Those recordings are safely stored in my phone. I intend to drop by your house and make a day out of... ...playing these conversations to your father and your husband. Okay with that, friend? This is my job! Really? Did you do this as just a job, Farhana? Did you speak to everyone like you did to me? "I don't wish to speak so closely with you anymore. I can't keep it up anymore." Had you just plainly told me that, I would've walked away from you. But what did you do? You take my call and go, "Tell me, friend"! As if nothing happened! When you shut the front door... ...won't you explain why you're shutting it to the man standing outside? I trusted a faceless stranger. And if you knew my face? A face is like a mask to a man. It won't easily give away what's in him or who he truly is. In life, many people will hurt us. That pain, the humiliation... We'd channel all of it towards someone. You are the manifestation of all of the treachery in my life! You need to experience that pain! You must've thought for a second before you said you wanted to see me. You wanted to see me, right? I'll make your dream come true! Why'd you stop? Let's go. -Until you come, I'll keep following you. He's stalking me. -You'll always be hearing my voice. Even now, he must be close. I'm with you. Come, let's go. There's no one there! Come! Why do you keep looking back? Someone's watching us back there. Nothing like that! That guy in the black shirt is staring at us! Look! Where? There's no one there. -Did you see or not? Yes, I did. -Let's go. Hey, Far... Let's head in, Nithya! -Hey! Come on! Why the hell are you following me? What did you figure out? How long have you suspected me? Farhana? Hey! Come here! It's because of this crap I didn't want to keep working! I know how a man's mind works! After claiming everyone will gossip if I didn't go work... ...you follow me to hear them gossip, huh? You don't have the smarts to pay the term fees! Instead of suspecting your wife... ...think about how you can help put food on the table! If you really don't believe me... ...I'll collect my incentive and quit my job today. Nothing like that. If you want to ask me something, do it directly. (U) It's no big deal. I'll come in the evening. These girls keep roaming about! Who'll take care of the house? Who'll feed the kids? Women need to take care of the house! Bhai! When my husband abandoned me and took off, I was eighteen. My eldest daughter was one. And I was pregnant. If my father didn't have this shop... Had I not managed this place and just stayed at home, who'd have fed me? My husband took off! Should my kids and I have died by not fending for ourselves? Or should I have remarried, and wait for my new husband to save me? Who knows how long one's life will go on! Will you always be around to take care? What if something happens to you and your girls ends up destitute? They need to fend for themselves, right? "To speak to a female friend, press two!" I welcome you to the world of friendship! Go on, sir. Hello? You won't have any more trouble. He can't call you anymore. Tell me, friend. I'm Priya. What's your name? Friend? "To continue speaking with yester..." Isha? "Isha?" No... And you are? She's not here, friend. We can talk! Isha? -She's not here. Want to talk to another? You can shift to another team next week. Thank you, sir. Your phone's ringing in the locker room. -"My phone?" Why so many calls? (U) Wife? I found this phone on the road. When I tried calling the number saved as 'Wife'? I find you on the other end. Your husband? Poor chap! They loaded him in an ambulance and took him to a hospital! Hit and run! Must be done by now! Just a small accident. Wait... How did you know about it? Who told you? The hospital called. My phone's missing too, Farhana. I don't know who took it. Watch your step. (U) Careful. (U) Careful, brother. (U) You're okay, right? Hello? -Why did you turn off your cell? To avoid such bad influences or nuisance calls, huh? And if you do that? Think you can get away, huh? I'm at Rahmat store at your street corner. I've bought health drinks and fruits for your husband! (U) Who is it? They found your phone at the site of your accident. They want our address. Wow, Isha! Learnt how to talk like this, huh? Extraordinary, Isha! -Get their address. We'll go pick it up ourselves. No... they're close by. I'm close by. I'll come meet you, tell him that you work for a chat service... ...the same service through which we were introduced to one another... How about that, Isha? Normally, it's the husband who must know everything about his wife. Isn't it funny that I know everything that he doesn't? Why risk it? Why take the trouble? If you were to tell me where you are... ...I'll have my father collect it from you. Will you come to my house to see me? Seems difficult. Give it to my father. Tell me, Isha. Or... should I come over right now? If I were to come over... ...would you be more shocked? Or would your husband be more shocked? Will you come? Or shall I come? This alley, right? Shall I tell your husband that you stood me up and deceived me? And shall I apologize for running him over in a fit of rage? Okay. -Which means what? Okay. I'll come. It sounds so sweet to hear that! When I call you at work tomorrow morning... ...you must pick up and say, "Hello, friend! I heartily welcome you!" If that call is directed to anyone else... Go to work, tomorrow. Now come out and look. You don't know a single thing about him! But he knows everything about you! Don't do it. Rather than wallow in fear for the rest of my life... ...I'd rather die! Why go on like a broken record? He came right up to my doorstep! What am I supposed to do? Shall I tell the police? They'd say a chat worker got stuck with a psychopath! And if I hang myself to death? Will that solve everything? I want to meet him in person... ...and ask him what he wants. Will you give him what he asks for? Answer me, Farhana. It's come too far. I can't run anymore. You are right. I don't know a single thing about him. I must find out. "It's not just a copy of the bill." "It's an individual's lifestyle. Their purchasing power." "Who are they? What kind of people are they?" "What do they like?" "It will show you all of it!" You said the first week of April, right? -Yes. During that week, someone had bought this. How do you know it's the same instrument? Product ID matches, ma'am. Got a phone number? -No, ma'am. Your balafon, ma'am. Excuse me. -Yes? Cash or card? Card. Which bank? -Yours! HSDC! 4216... ...1280... ...7359. Dhayalan. Pull up every card under the name 'A. Dhayalan'. Check who purchased in this musical shop. That one, right? Yes. It's this card, Farhana! Someone's using this card now, Farhana. "Someone?" It's him! EX Mall, Velachery. If he swiped once, he'll definitely swipe again, right? If he does, we'll nab him, right? "Nab him?" Sister? Great idea. Can I come with you? If you want to be of help to me, please don't come. Have you reached? Tell me, Nithya. Did he swipe? -No. Did he swipe, Nithya? Which shop is he in? "The Body Shop"! "The Body Shop?" "The Body Shop". Second floor. Thank you, sir. -Thanks. You're welcome. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hello? Farhana? -Call him, Nithya. Hello? -We're calling from HSDC Bank, sir. This is a random security call. Was it you who just used your card at "The Body Shop"? You are Mister... Dhayalan. Thank you, sir. Okay. He's the guy, Farhana. Far-ha-na. Farhana! Want my cell phone? (A) Greetings, Bhai. -(A) Greetings. What is it, dear? -Phone. Take a look at this. Is it ready? (U) Thanks. -(U) Check if it's okay. (U) No need for that! Give my regards to your father. -(U) Thank you, Bhai. Hello? Taking my phone will solve everything, eh? I was itching to meet you and speak to you... But the thought of our relationship ending like this? It's so disappointing. Your husband uses WhatsApp, right? He'll be at home now, yes? By the time you get phone, I'll send every recording to him, one by one. Okay, friend? Hello? Greetings. (U) Who is it? Hello? Hello? Farhana? (U) A cup of tea. Farhana! Farhana! What are you doing? Making tea? Take a day off from work tomorrow. I'm doing all the work here! No provisions at home too! I can't move an inch from the kids! Take care of them tomorrow. I'll go pick up the provisions. Fathima? -What is it? Nothing. -The phone, huh? It feels like there's a deep connection between me and Sofia. Whenever I see her... In a past life... ...it feels like I was her, and she was me. She is dead, Farhana! Are you crazy? Don't do this. As long as you run, dogs will keep chasing you. I'll come. Will this work? Shall I come with you? Hello? Your wife Isha... Sorry... Farhana... ...has come to see me without telling you. She refuses to listen to reason. Can you come here and pick her up? I've sent you the location on WhatsApp. Come in! Far-ha-na. Farhana! A beautiful and profound voice spoke to me. I was trapped by that voice and the woman I imagined who owned it. When that voice was about to slowly fade out... ...I thought everything was going to come to an end. I was scared. I needed to know where that voice originated from. You must always be in my mind and my imagination. That thing you said? An image you wanted to keep forever? Here is that image! With your voice alone, my mind created a beautiful painting of you. And here you are! As perfect as I imagined! Your voice is you. You are your voice. A beautiful musical instrument on its own. I would've just listened to your voice and merrily gone about my life. But you lit that spark in me. It spread like wildfire! When you got here... How to invite you in? Where to seat you? What to offer you to eat? What to speak to you? I had penned an entire script! Do you know how many times I rehearsed this? I know you hate me. I get it. But between the two of us... At least for a few days... ...there was genuine love. Isn't that true? You liked chatting with me, right? I waited for you at the station... I got beat up... I got humiliated... All for you! Despite all that, I wasn't mad at you. But when I called you out of panic, worried that something happened to you... ...you chased me away as if I were a dog! You treated me like a pervert who hangs around chat rooms! Do you know how much it hurt? I wanted you to experience a small fraction of what I went through! Threatening you on the phone... Threatening to release the audio files... Poor Kareem... Running him over with my car... It was all wrong. I shouldn't have done that. What do you want from me? Farhana? Farhana? Farhana? Farhana! (U) What happened? (U) Get up. (U) What happened, Farhana? (U) What happened? (U) What's wrong? Farhana... (U) What happened? (U) Tell me, Farhana. Farhana... It's okay. Did you... ...like him? Yes, I did. As a friend. Had he not been there that day, I wouldn't have been able to do that job. But when I learned of his other face... ...I began to despise him! Trusting just a voice... I thought a faceless stranger... ...would be a good man. That was my mistake. Not only that. There's always something running in my mind. I've not been able to talk about it with anyone here. You and I never talk about anything but our problems. When someone spoke to me like that out of the blue... ...I opened up... ...and casually spoke to him. I'm a good-for-nothing. I haven't made good things happen in your life. I haven't been able to do anything to help the family too. Even though I didn't like that you started working... ...I didn't want to ruin it for you. When I fitted slippers on your feet... ...I hoped you would not have to struggle. When you set out to meet someone with a tiffin box... ...I was crushed at the thought that something terrible was about to happen. I felt like jumping in front of that train and dying! You are my world! But you? Despite being tangled in such distress... ...did it never occur to you to trust me and tell me what happened? I was afraid. I was really afraid that this would make me lose you and the kids forever. What if I did tell you and you stopped me going to work? I was scared that our financial situation would be back to what it was. I wanted to get past all of this somehow and make it out. But I never expected that he'd just keep coming after me. No, sis. -I need his recordings. Tell me, sister. Prithvi? -Would this put your job in any trouble... You should've told me this sooner! What the heck, Bhai? The next time he calls, say you'll come. Don't be afraid. I'll come. Alright then. Go there and turn on the recorder. We'll be right outside. The moment he admits he spoke to you on the phone, we'll head in. You claim to have true love... ...and then stalk me like a shadow... ...and try to blackmail me. A fellow who chats for five minutes, drops the call and goes his way... ...is far better than someone like you! Farhana hasn't gone to work yet? Every bird has a limit to how high and how far they can fly. Despite that, no bird remains in its nest and stubbornly refuses to fly. Another girl could've done this same job in a smarter and easier way. Card section suits me fine. I'm not running away in fear. This is enough, Nithya. This is my comfort zone. Hello? Good morning, sir. Is it a good time to talk to you?
