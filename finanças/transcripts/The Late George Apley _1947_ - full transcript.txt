Ah, Wilson. A fine morning for Thanksgiving. Did you enjoy your walk, sir? - Very much, thank you. Though I did see a man in shirtsleeves at a front door on Marlborough Street. It's rather cold for shirt sleeves, sir. - That is hardly the point, Wilson. It is never warm enough for shirt sleeves. - No, sir. Fortunately it was on Marlborough Street. Not Beacon Street. Yes, sir. What is it now, Margaret? It?s those green bugs, Mr Apley. Why does something like this always have to happen on Thanksgiving. Last year there was a blizzard. The year before that, the mince pies fermented. You know of course this isn't the first time we've been attacked by aphids. The last time was the year of the Spanish war. Oh. Well, it's just another of those little things, Margaret. Little things that interfere with our lives. Let me see. Emerson had something capital to say about that. Wait a minute, Margaret. I wish you wouldn't put the Scarlet Letter next to Emerson. Here we are. "God reappears with all his parts in every moss and every cobweb." "If the good is there, so is the evil." "If the affinity, so the repulsion." There you have it. Ah, my dear. Back already, George? There is a new building going up on Boylston Street. It is to house something called a "Haberdashery". How do you like them? - Like what, my dear? The snapdragons with the pumpkins. - Snapdragons and pumpkins. Why, you've never done that before. - I know. It just came over me. Verging a bit on the radical, isn't it? Where is John? - Oh, he'll be here. You know how slow those trolleys are from Cambridge. He ought to be here now with Agnes coming for dinner. Yes, of course. George. Yes, my dear? Does it seem to you that John has been a bit .. Well, strange, these past few weeks? Oh, no stranger than usual. You must remember John is a sophomore. I wonder if it could be a girl. Some other girl? Not Agnes? Oh nonsense, my dear. John would have told us. I wonder .. What's in the paper, George? Oh, Mr Justice Holmes has written another dissent. This child labor case. I do wish he'd show a little more judgement. But you are against child labor. I know. But this constant dissenting .. Creates a bad general impression. Especially in a Bostonian. - Is there any news from Europe? Europe? Let's see. Thank you, my dear. Foreign news. Here we are. Boston woman becomes mother of triplets in Rome. Oh! Anyone we know? Catherine. - I'd love to go to Rome. Why, Catherine. Well we never seem to go anywhere, George. Boston in the winter. Pequod Island in the summer. It's the same thing every year. I've never heard you talk like this before. Why shouldn't we do the same thing every year? Besides, you know how difficult it is for me to get away. I've so many obligations. Now take next week for example. On Monday night there's the trustees meeting of the Boston Waif Society. Our family charity. On Tuesday afternoon, the Tuesday afternoon club. On Tuesday night, the Save Boston Society. It is about allowing an electric sign on the edge of the common. Is that so important, George? My dear, it is going to say "Grape Nuts". I suppose we must put a stop to that. Wednesday afternoon. Committed to enquire into what's wrong with Harvard football. Wednesday night. The Wednesday night club. Thursday. I know there is something on Thursday. We are giving Agnes her coming-out party. Yes, I know my dear but there is something else. Something more important. Ah, Thursday. Yes, of course. On Thursday afternoon .. There is special meeting of the Blue Hill Birdwatchers Society. Is that more important, George? - This particular meeting? I think so, my dear. You remember that old Dr Beech died last week. Well, there has to be a new president of The Birdwatchers. And I have every reason to believe .. Oh George, how splendid. Mind you, I don't say I'm worthy of it. I think what really tipped the scales in my favor was last Sunday. When I saw the yellow-bellied sapsucker. Have I told you about that? Yes, I think so. A yellow-bellied sapsucker in November. It was quite late in the afternoon. And I was coming home through the Goodrich's pasture. And as I was .. John. Be right down. Got to wash. Can't you wash at Harvard? I do hope John isn't studying too hard. What makes you think he is, my dear? - Well, his eyes. They look so tired. And so red. I've noticed it particularly on Sundays. Do you think Harvard is right to make him study so hard on Saturday nights? Harvard, my dear. Let me see, where were we? Oh yes, I was .. We seem to do so many little things, George. We never seem to do anything really important. You don't think the Boston Waifs are important? Yes, I suppose they are, but .. Couldn't someone else look after the Boston Waifs? - My dear. I mean just for a little while? - I'm a trustee. Yes, I know, but .. Someone has to be a trustee for the Boston Waifs. Someone has to prevent harmful literature from reaching our libraries. Someone has to keep electric signs off the common. My grandfather. My father. These are things that have come down to me, Catherine. You do so much for others. So little for yourself. I know it's hard for you, my dear. But those of us who are comfortable off .. Must never forget our duty to those who are not comfortably off. I can only think of myself as a steward. Who owes the community a definite debt. As such, I have tried to be, as my father was before me. And his father before him. And as my son will be someday. Yes, George. Let me see, I believe Emerson has something capital to say about that. Here come Roger and Amelia. - Splendid. Tell the children. Where is Eleanor by the way? She won't be here. - Won't be here? For Thanksgiving dinner? It's her young man, George. - I never heard of such a thing. Please don't say anything in front of the others. She promised to bring him in after dinner. I never heard of such a thing. Well, Wilson. Having a happy Thanksgiving? Yes thank you, Mrs Newcombe. - Of course. Doesn't he look happy? How are your teeth, Margaret? - Dandy, thank you, ma'am. It doesn't rub anymore, does it? - No, ma'am. I'm glad you took my advice Catherine, and sent Margaret to Dr Bailey. He was father's dentist you know. I know. He's getting so old he can't even see cavities. Hello, George. I know. But he's very good if you find your own cavities .. And point them out to him. Nice of you to come, Amelia. Where else would I go on Thanksgiving? My own brother. You need a haircut, George. Well. Where are the children? John is washing. Eleanor is .. - Eleanor .. Eleanor is with a young man. A young man? I never had a young man on Thanksgiving. Too late now. Well. Who is this young man? His name is Boulder. Howard Boulder. Boulder? I don't know any Boulders. Is he from Boston? He is from New York. New York? Now, Amelia. We must be broadminded. New York is .. Well, it's not Boston of course. As a matter of fact, I know some people from New York. Several .. people. Well, if he is from New York, what is he doing in Boston? He's lecturing at Harvard. Something to do with the Jonathan Smythe fellowship. The Jonathan Smythe of course. You know the Jonathan Smythe fellowship, Roger? Buzzy Lauring is trustee for it. - Oh, yes. Do you know I worked out how to remember what Buzzy Lauring is trustee for? Is that so? How do you do it? Whatever it is, if you're not the trustee for it, he is. [ Doorbell ] I'll take it, Wilson. Roger, you promised me. Thanksgiving, my dear. Unless I'm mistaken, that's Horatio at the door. What was it Harriet Prescott Spofford said? "Dear, the people coming home." "All the glad and happy play." "Dear the thanks to, that we give." "For all of this Thanksgiving day." Dear Harriet Prescott Spofford. Once more, please. How do you do, Roger. Amelia. - Where is Agnes? Agnes? Oh Agnes, dear. Your cousin Amelia is asking for you. I'm coming, Papa. Well, Agnes my dear. Well, what are you afraid of? It's only the family. Where is John? Agnes is here and not John. Hello everybody. - Hello, John. Well, what are you standing there for? Aren't you going to speak to your cousin Agnes? Hello Agnes. Hello John. How does that go, Horatio? "All the glad and happy play?" Well, Agnes. Aren't you going to give John his present? Oh Papa, not now. Horatio, is she doesn't want to give it to him now .. Of course she wants to give it to him now. Why shouldn't she? It's a tie. She knitted it herself. How sweet. Incredible. Well, why don't you .. Why don't you put it on right now, John? Oh, he doesn't have to do that. I'm knitting him another one now. With a lot more stripes. Thanks Agnes, it's wonderful. Really it is. Just what I wanted. Thanks a lot. Oh George. I knew I had something to tell you. I ran into Walter Noble this morning. He told me about The Birdwatchers. George is going to be the next president of The Birdwatchers. No, no. It's not definite at all yet. You really mustn't say a thing about it. It's very interesting though, how it all came about. Do tell us, George. Well it happened last Sunday quite late in the afternoon. I was crossing the Goodrich's pasture. Just where the path forks towards the brook. No the big brook. The little brook. I don't know what fist caught my attention. There was no sound. John. Oh, I'm sorry sir. Merely a flash of color in the junipers. A bright flash of yellow. I just had time to raise my glasses. And there, sitting on the lower limb. Of the big shagbark hickory by the stone wall. George. Sitting there quietly as though it were mid-summer. - George. Not making a sound, mind you. Yes, my dear? Dinner is ready. Oh yes, well we'll go in. Amelia. John. Suppose you give Agnes your arm. Come along, Jane. But what was sitting there? You can't leave us dangling, man. A yellow-belied sapsucker. No! - Yes. No. Yes. A yellow-bellied sapsucker. I suppose I'm the only living Bostonian who's seen one so late in November. Now then, white meat for Amelia but no stuffing. Now that we're all together here, there is a little family matter I may take up. It's about cousin Hattie. Cousin Hattie is dead. Been dead for a month. That's just the point. While she was alive, she gave us very little trouble. Jane. Dark meat. And stuffing. As you know, the Henry Apleys are a very distant branch of the family. They are barely Apleys at all. Do you really think you should go into this? I'm not sure you did the right thing. I'm convinced that I did, Catherine. Come to the point, George. What is it all about? It's about cousin Hattie's burial. You mean to say they haven't buried her yet? They buried her at Mount Auburn. And to that I have no general objection. The family plot is completely democratic. Any Apley connection. No matter how remote. Is welcome to rest there. Even you, Horatio. By Jove, thank you, George. Well, you're all fixed now, Horatio. I always try to be present at every family internment. But in cousin Hattie's case I was unavoidable detained. Well, as long as cousin Hattie was there. Please, Roger. Last week. Catherine and I happened to visit Mount Auburn. I was particularly anxious to see .. How the arborvitae border was doing at the back of father's stone. Suddenly. To my astonishment. I saw a new headstone of pink granite with a recumbent figure on it. And there. In our part of the lot. Was cousin Hattie, large as life. Well, there is nothing we can do about it now. On the contrary. I have written Henry Apley a letter explaining that he must .. He must .. move his mother somewhere else. Say .. Down to the bottom of the slope. It was very pushing of the Henry Apleys. Putting their mother right where George might want to go. That is hardly the point, Horatio. The. The only thing is. Boston will be split into factions over this. People will take sides. It will create talk. It won't create talk at all. Who gives a hoot where the Apleys are buried? Roger. You know it is possible .. There's quite a few people in the world who have never even heard of the Apleys. Nonsense! Everyone has heard of us. In Boston, anyhow. Whenever I'm depressed, I remind myself that I .. am an Apley. I'll have mine without stuffing, George. Roger. - Thank you, George. I have your chair, George. - Oh no, no. Well? We've sat in these same seats for eighteen Thanksgivings. Why, what a peculiar thing to say, Jane. Where else should we sit? What would Thanksgiving be without a family? Agnes, why don't you play something on the piano? Oh no, Papa. I'd rather not. Agnes has learned a new piece. Would you all like to hear it? We should all like to hear it very much. Well. It is a waltz. - I'm very fond of waltzes. So is John. Aren't you, John? Yes, sir. It?s called "Sweet Little Marigold". Why, that's one of your cousin George's favorites. Mother. This is Mr Boulder. How do you do. - How do you do. My father. - How do you do. How do you do, sir. Mrs Newcombe. Mrs Willing. Mr Willing. How do you do. - Miss Willing. My brother. - Hello, Ellie. And Mr Newcombe - Mr Boulder. How do you do, Mr Boulder. - How do you do. Eleanor has been telling us about you, Mr Boulder. Do sit down. It's just a family party. Thank you. Eleanor. - No, you. Will you have a cigar, Mr Boulder? No thank you, sir. But if you have a cigarette? I'm afraid we've never gone quite so far as cigarettes. That's alright, sir. If you don't mind? Eleanor tells me. You are giving the Jonathan Smythe lectures at Emerson Hall. Yes, I am. That's quite an achievement at your age, Mr Boulder. Oh, I'm probably a year or two older than I look, sir. He's been lecturing ever since he got his .. PhD. You have a PhD.? Where was that, Mr Boulder? Yale. - Yale? But of course you were .. You weren't an undergraduate there. No, I went to Lehigh - Lehigh? That's what he said. Well, as a matter of fact, I wanted to go to Harvard, but .. I couldn't afford it, so I worked my way through Lehigh as a waiter. Well. As a waiter, eh? Lehigh. Well .. Eleanor, the ash tray. It's too late. He moved. I'm terribly sorry, sir. - Oh, that's quite alright. George, take my chair. No, no. Horatio. - Yes, I can .. Are you excited about coming out, Agnes? Oh yes. But I am a little bit afraid. There is nothing to be afraid of. You just see the same old faces. No Yale boys. No Princeton boys. Just Harvard boys. And what is the matter with Harvard boys? Nothing father. They just go to Harvard. Anyway, the whole thing is an outmoded folk custom. The what? - Boston is full of them. We are like a savage tribe. We suffer from ancestor worship. Thanksgiving is a typical tribal feast. And coming out is nothing but an old idea .. Of introducing the virgin to the rest of the tribe. Really, Eleanor. There are some things we simply don't mention. If things exist I don't see why we shouldn't face them. Because we do not face virginity in the drawing room after a Thanksgiving dinner. What do you lecture on, Mr Boulder? It's a course on American literature. Especially the Concord group. The Concord group. Well. That would be all the great figures. Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne. I think I might attend one of your lectures myself, Mr Boulder. What is your next one about? It is called the Concord radicals. Did you say "radicals", Mr Boulder? - Yes, sir. I must confess, I can't very well picture Emerson as a radical. Well he was sir, for his time. So were the others. Why, take Thoreau's essay on civil disobedience. Why there was a time when .. Beacon Street had no use for Emerson at all. And now they all quote him. You see, that's the point I make in my lecture. Yesterday's radical is today's stuffed shirt. It is my occasional practice to quote Emerson, Mr Boulder. I do it myself sir. It's catching. Yes. Yes, indeed. Well. We really must be going. We are invited to Cambridge for tea. Some friends of Howard's. - Oh. Must you .. go? Yes. I am afraid we are a little bit late. Goodbye, Mr Apley. - Goodbye, Mr Boulder. Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, Mrs Apley. Do come again, Mr Boulder. Oh he will. He'll come a lot. Well. Goodbye, everybody. Goodbye, sir. I wonder if Buzzy Lauring ever heard those lectures. He couldn't have. He wouldn't tolerate it for a minute. Agnes, do play some more. Wouldn't you all like Agnes to play some more? Come, dear. Will you all excuse me, please. I'm afraid I've got to go. What? I'm sorry, sir. There is an English Lit' examination. Surely, you can wait to hear Agnes play? Well, I did hear her play. I mean, I wish I could. Agnes, maybe next week sometime we'll get together. I'm awfully sorry, You will forgive me. I can't understand John's behaviour. Well, as long as her cousins can't stay to entertain her .. I think we may as well go too. Don't you, Agnes? Yes, Papa. - Come, Jane. Oh, really. - Jane. I .. Well, it seems George can't even manage his own children. Amelia! Oh, I'm not blaming you, Catherine. I feel sorry for you. Well, I don't feel sorry for myself. I'm perfectly satisfied. I did think we could have one Thanksgiving without a family quarrel. Come along, Roger. I should have been the boy. Father always said so. Goodbye, Catherine. - Goodbye, Roger. The pilgrims have the Indians, George. We have Amelia. Really, George. Amelia's manners are getting worse all the time. The Apley women always had bad manners. But I was looking forward to a happy family party. Catherine. Are you using violet perfume? Why, certainly not. What a question, George. I smell perfume. Cheap violet perfume. It can't be Amelia. It's this. It reeks of violets. It is addressed to John. It is addressed to John in a woman's handwriting. Catherine, you are right. This explains his entire attitude. Oh, good heavens. - What? It is postmarked "Worcester" Worcester? Catherine. The girl is a foreigner. Will you have some chestnuts, sir? - Thank you. Here you are, sir. Thank you, sir. [ Singing ] "Every little moment has a meaning of its own." "Every little something has a .." You wouldn't dare. I wouldn't dare, wouldn't I? No. You wouldn't dare, wouldn't you. Oh, it's about time you learned. That you should never dare an Apley. It's about time you learned there are some things a Boulder won't take. Even from an Apley. Oh, they won't? That does it. - What? Howard, I didn't mean it. Howard, let's talk it over. Howard, I didn't mean it. Please, Howard. Howard, you couldn't. Howard, you wouldn't. Howard, no. No! Is there anything I can do, George? I am perfectly capable of handling my own affairs, Horatio. Thank you. Goodnight, gentlemen. - Goodnight. Goodnight Howard. Goodnight, Eleanor. I wonder if I should have done that. Why shouldn't you? Because it may be the first time a girl was kissed goodnight on Beacon Street. Howard, you are not going to start thinking that way too? I guess it's just the atmosphere. It tends to get you. You will have to fight it then. Because here is the second time. Eleanor. Yes, father? Eleanor. I shall have to ask you for an explanation of your behaviour. What behaviour? We do not throw snowballs at midnight in the public garden at strange young men. And what is wrong with throwing snowballs? You were seen by several trustees of the Boston Waifs. Oh, bother the Boston Waifs. As well as by your cousin, Horatio. Double bother cousin Horatio. - Eleanor. Eleanor, this is a very serious matter. I am aware of the fact .. That the Apley women are often headstrong and eccentric. Your aunt Amelia is an example. Your great aunt Sarah kept pet mice in her dining room. There is such a thing as carrying eccentricity too far. It wasn't eccentricity. I was just having a good time. Second cousin Theodora thought she was just "having a good time" as you call it. When she found herself married to an Irishman named O'Halloran. And .. why shouldn't she marry an Irishman named O'Halloran? Eleanor. Here, let me help you. - Oh. Thank you. Eleanor. Did that young man try to kiss you? Yes. He tried to. And I let him. You let him? Oh father, it .. It isn't so terrible, is it? I mean I won't have to wear a .. A scarlet letter or anything like that, will I? But why? Father. I'm in love with him. That has nothing to do with it. Oh, but it has. Emotion is healthy, father. It's right there in Freud. - In what? The new book my Dr Sigmund Freud. I borrowed it from a Radcliffe girl. They are all reading it. Dr Freud says that it isn't showing emotion that is unhealthy. It is repressing it. Pretending it doesn't exist. The way we do in Boston. It is my opinion that Boston is what it is .. Largely because we believe in putting emotion in its place .. And keeping it there. Well, that's just what's wrong with us. Yes. I think I've heard about enough. Now go to bed. We'll discuss it with your mother in the morning. Yes, father. Goodnight. Goodnight. Ah, my dear. George, we must send for a man from the arboretum to trim the rubber tree. It's about to burst through the roof. The last time it did that, my mother had the .. The roof raised. Well, it would be much easier to trim the tree. My dear, we mustn't forget that my grandmother planted this tree. It's probably the oldest rubber tree in Boston. Well it's certainly the biggest and the ugliest. I suppose one couldn't call it a handsome tree, but after all .. In any case, it is too important a matter to be decided hastily. Yes, George. Here is a letter from Henry Apley. Cousin Hattie has been .. moved. Oh, I hope you haven't hurt his feelings. He has taken her out of Mount Auburn entirely. He need hardly have done that. "In view of your astonishing attitude." I don't think my attitude was astonishing. "It is my present plan to have her buried at sea." "I trust you have no prior rights in the Atlantic Ocean." That seems an unnecessary remark. Well I .. I do hope that's the end of it. Yes, Wilson? - Mr Williams, sir. Oh yes, yes. I .. I've asked him to come. George, I've been to Worcester and I .. - Shush. But I've .. - Wait, wait .. Well. Now. Tell me everything. Well. Their name is "Dole". Dole. - Julian H. Dole. And the girl? Myrtle. Myrtle Dole? Mr Dole is the president of the Dole Tool And Die Company. Good morning, Horatio. What is a "tool and die" company? I don't know. But I went to their house, George. There was an iron deer on the lawn. An iron ..? - I was inside the house, George. How did you manage that? I said I was the man to read the gas meter. Though of course, I'm hardly the type. By Jove, I'd never have thought of that. Of course you would, if you put your mind to it. Anyway, once inside it was a simple matter to engage a maid in conversation. And what did she tell you? As you know, George. I have a way with women. Yes, yes Horatio, but what did you find out? John has been down there almost every evening. In addition there are two letters daily and flowers all the time. She said it was cute to see him so sweet on Miss Myrtle. When Miss Myrtle was so sweet on him. Those are her words, of course. I want to be broadminded about this. These people, these Julian W. Doles may be perfectly .. What was that? - Julian H. Dole. It doesn't matter, Horatio. As I was saying they may be perfectly nice people but .. An iron deer, you said? - Yes, and a fountain. Of course, the fountain wasn't working. - Why not? Not at this time of year, George. - No. No, of course not. I'm sure you'll be able to handle it, George. Well, I'm very grateful to you, Horatio. - No trouble at all. I'll walk along with you. - Going to the pub? No, I'm going to Harvard. But George, you went to Harvard thirty years ago. I am going to attend a lecture. Buzzy Lauring. Young Boulder, eh? I'm glad you're doing this, George. We must think of Eleanor's reputation. It has nothing to do with Eleanor's reputation. It has to do with Emerson's reputation. I think Buzzy Lauring should know .. What Mr Boulder is saying about Ralph Waldo Emerson. That's all. Coming, George? Yes. Yes, I'm coming. You are late. - Yes. My department had to send for me - And you forgot to bring your skates. Howard, what is it? I've been fired. Howard. Why? Oh, apparently Mr Bosworth Lauring. Seems to think I'm poisoning the mind of fair Harvard. Bosworth Lauring? That's Buzzy Lauring, father's best friend. Howard. I thought that might be it. I saw your father at my last lecture. If he thinks he can do .. I'm going home this minute. - Now, wait a minute. In the first place you will have to take your skates off. And second, I'd rather you said nothing about it. Of course I will say something. I'll make them take you back. - Look. I've thought about this thing. If the job depends upon the whim of this .. Buzzy whatisname it's not the kind of a job I want. Howard, what will you do? Go to New York I guess. Look for something else. I had an offer from Columbia several weeks ago. It may still be open. But what will I do? You can go away and .. But I have to stay in Boston and I couldn't stand Boston without you. Oh, Howard. Isn't this sort of public? - I don't care. It will do them good. You there! Want to see something? I'll open it, Wilson. Oh, it's you. Is that a way to greet your own sister? I'm delighted to see you of course, Amelia. But I was expecting a committee from The Birdwatchers. Amelia. I'll wear the feather studs tonight, Wilson. Not the moonstone. The moonstones are prettier, George. Not in a gathering of young girls, my dear. Isn't it exciting, Amelia. Our own little Agnes coming out at last. I do hope John has asked Agnes for the supper dance. Oh yes. I saw his name on her dance program. Remember how George used to fill out our programs for us. That's how I met Horatio. George wrote him in. I wonder what can be detaining the committee? I hope you can stay, Amelia. Jane is sending Agnes over in her new ball-gown. It is going to be too low in the bosom. I have some tulle. Do stay. First, I am going up to the attic to get grandmother's cuckoo clock. You've already taken the brass finger-bowls with the whistles on them. I want to speak to you, father. Speak to me, Eleanor? - Don't pretend. You know perfectly well what I mean. - Eleanor, the workmen. I hope you're satisfied with what you've done. You and your Buzzy Lauring. - Really, Eleanor. Merely because I tried to protect the memory of the late Ralph Waldo Emerson. Don't be a hypocrite, father. It doesn't become you. Hypocrite? I never thought I would hear my own little girl .. I'm not your little girl. I'm a woman. Eleanor .. - Yes. A woman in love. Does that shock you? Oh can't you understand, father? This is serious. I want to marry Howard. I want to have his children. I want my life with him. Won't you even try to understand? I do understand, Ellie. Perhaps better than you think. When you are in love it all seems very easy, doesn't it. There is nothing else to think about except just being in love. But life isn't so simple. You have a position in the world. You're an Apley. And you can't ever forget it. But I don't want to be an Apley. I just want to be Mrs Boulder. - No, Ellie. You and I can't do things like that. We can't escape what we are. Other people might be able to, but we can't. Why can't we? Why can't we? You may as well face it, Ellie. You were born in Boston. Boston. Boston is not just a city. It's a state of mind. You can't run away from a state of mind. You wouldn't be happy. If you call marrying Howard running away from it .. I'll be happy. Happiness is a very rare commodity, Ellie. Especially in New England. Father. That's why we're so good at finding substitutes for it. For example, when I was a young man, I started a collection of Chinese bronzes. It might be a good idea if you were to start some sort of .. Collection of your own. Oriental daggers, butter knives. It doesn't matter. You great aunt Penelope collected shaving mugs. Father, how can you? Frankly .. I don't know anyone who likes Chinese bronzes. But I have one of the finest collections in the country. Now. You are overwrought now. Suppose we talk about it later? If you like .. I'll intercede with Buzzy Lauring to have young Boulder .. It's too late. He won't come back. He's too proud. He's going away and I'll never see him again. Ellie. Hello, Eleanor. Ellie. Oh, I'm sorry, cousin George. My mother said that .. Oh .. Agnes, my dear. Tell Mrs Apley that Miss Willing is here. Well now, let's .. Let's see. George. What's the matter with Eleanor? Don't say "nothing at all". I know better. She isn't feeling well, Amelia. No, she certainly isn't. She came running upstairs, looked at me and said Freud would like to get at you. What did she mean by that? It is much too low in the bosom. Agnes, my dear. You look charming. Thank you, cousin Catherine. The dress is sweet. Perhaps just a little piece of tulle. Margaret can sew it on for you upstairs. Somehow, it doesn't look very much like a ball-gown, does it? Well, of course it does, George. You like all those .. Frills? - Well everyone has them. Don't you like it at all, cousin George? Who said I didn't like it, my dear? I've no doubt we'll all like it very much once we get accustomed to it. Accustomed to it? Oh .. yes. Now we have something for you. My grandmother's pearls. We want you to wear them tonight, my dear. Because one day we hope .. They look lovely on you, Agnes. There. Just what you needed. Splendid. Now, no-one will notice the dress at all. I've got to see you, sir. John, what is the matter? - I want to speak to father. Don't you see your mother? Don't you see Agnes? I want to see you. Come along, Agnes. We'll go up to the sewing room. Father, I .. - I know, John. You've found out your cousin Horatio has been to Worcester. Yes. And what I want to know is .. - Not now, John. I'm not in the mood for any more of these discussions. We'll talk about it tomorrow. But sir ..? - John. My father once said this to me, John. He said .. I am the only father you will ever have. And you are the only son I will ever have. It is something I have never forgotten. And you must believe when I say that what I do .. I do because I am his son. And because you are my son. Yes, sir. Now. You've been very unkind to your cousin Agnes lately. I want you to be particularly nice to her tonight. After all. It's her coming-out party. We have to go on living, John. Aren't they sweet, John and Agnes. You must be very happy, Jane. Oh. I am. When's he going to ask her? Why. I should think that would be up to John. Don't be ridiculous. It's never up to the young man. I remember how it was with Roger and me. We were sitting in the parlor one evening. Father came in and said: "when is the wedding going to be?" Remember, Roger? I'm not likely to forget it, my dear. John. - Yes? Do you notice anything? About me, I mean. No. - Well, look. You've got your hair done differently. It looks fine. Yes, but what else? It's the pearls, John. It's your great grandmother's pearls. Don't you see them? Yes, they look wonderful. You don't mind having me wear them? No. Of course not. Oh, I'm awfully glad, John. From the way you've been acting lately. I was afraid you would mind. I'm awfully glad. Agnes, there is something I want to tell you. Yes, John? I realize that I have been rude and thoughtless lately. Oh you haven't. - Oh, I know I have. Well, it's because I've had a great deal on my mind. I hope you will understand and forgive me. Of course, John. We've known each other so long. Ever since we were children. Since as far back as I remember, you've always been there. In fact, sometimes I've wondered if we don't know each other too well. What? Why, I don't see how two people .. That is a boy and a girl, can know each other too well if .. If .. You ought to say it, John. Agnes, you don't understand. I'm not trying to ask you to marry me. I'm trying to tell you that .. Well, that there is someone else. Who is it? You don't know her. I hope someday you will. But Agnes, I know how you must feel about it. How long have you been .. in love with her? Since I first met her. Three weeks and four days ago. Agnes, you are not .. You don't mind, do you? No, no. How can I mind, John. It's .. It's not your fault. You couldn't help it. We can't help falling in love. Nobody can. John. John. It's Agnes. I think I'd better go .. - No, no. I'll go. Agnes. Agnes, listen to me. Yes, cousin, Cassy. You mustn't be so upset. I can't help it. I'm sorry I made such a fool of myself. Here. Thank you. Oh, cousin Cassy. What am I going to do? When you are feeling better you are going back downstairs with me. Oh no, I couldn't. - You must. It won't help to have people talking about you. I don't care what they say. They don't understand. None of them. Why, they can't. Even you don't understand. I think I can. I think I understand very well. You do .. cousin Cassy? Yes. You see what you are going through now isn't so very different. From what I went through, albeit a great many years ago. With your cousin, George. Cousin George. Was there ever anybody else with him? Yes. It happened during his senior year at college. We weren't exactly engaged, but there was an understanding. And then he met this girl. She was from south Boston. I saw her once. Quite by accident. A pretty little thing. Dark hair and blue eyes and the softest Irish voice. Mary Monaghan. I hated her. I cried myself to sleep every night hating her. And he loved her? Yes. He loved her. They were going to be married and go out west. You see. She couldn't live on Beacon Street. And he couldn't live in South Boston. But what happened? You are too young to have remembered your cousin George's father. Well, George was taken out of Harvard and sent to Europe. For his health. When he returned. We became engaged. But didn't he try to see her again? Oh, no. When he came back he realized that it wouldn't work. He'd made up his own mind about that. He understood thought he had to choose between Mary Monaghan .. and Boston. And George is an Apley. So the choice wasn't so difficult after all. That's why I'm telling you this story. John is an Apley too. He is so much like his father sometimes. When he was a young man. So much like him that sometimes it makes me laugh. And once or twice it's made me cry. Yes, but suppose John did get over this and he did come back to me? Would our marriage be really happy? Has mine been happy? I think so, Agnes. George and I. Though perhaps we've never been in love that way .. But we've had something else. Companionship. Sharing the same likes and dislikes. The same interests and activities. It's the little things, day by day, that make a happy marriage. Do you really think so, cousin Catherine? You mustn't lose hope. Ever. Oh, I won't. Now we are going back downstairs. Good evening, Eleanor. - Good evening. Good evening. Good evening, Ellie. - Good evening, uncle Roger. I haven't danced for years, but if you are game, I am. Oh, I'd love to. How is your head? - There is nothing wrong with it. Oh. Is that what father told you? I liked that young man of yours even if he did go to Yale. Do you know what happened? I heard about it at the club. Oh uncle Roger, what am I going to do? I think your poor old uncle has had enough, Ellie. My back isn't what it used to be. Oh, I'm sorry, uncle Roger. Thank you, anyway. - Thank you, my dear. And may I have a dance? - Of course. Could I have a word with you, George? Why of course, Roger. If you're looking for brandy Roger, that is not where we keep it in this house. No, it's where I keep it in this house. A splendid fellow, Wilson. What would you say if I told you I haven't touched brandy since my bachelor's dinner? I'd say you'd better touch one now. George, I ran into one of your birdwatchers on my way to the party. Yes. Did he ..? - He did. They didn't elect you, George. They asked the committee for another name. Another name? Why? Why, Roger? Because George, they think you have been making a blasted fool of yourself. No-one has called me a blasted fool since father died. You know George, those birdwatchers of yours are pretty sound people. At least, unlike most societies in Boston .. They are interested in something that is alive. But why did they do it? That cemetery business for one thing. Cousin Hattie. Henry Apley showed your letter around. Then they say .. You pushed young Boulder out of his job because he was seeing too much of Ellie. Did you? George, we've been through it all together. School and games and girls and Beacon Street. I'm not saying this because I like saying it. But I wonder if you see yourself as other people see you. Sit down, George. Don't get angry. Sit down. Horatio said he'd been to Worcester. What else did he tell you? Enough, so I can see you're doing the same thing with John .. That you did with Eleanor and cousin Hattie. Raising objections about things that don't matter. Because you live in a narrow world, George. My world, narrow? Yes, the man has an "iron deer" on his lawn so John can't marry his daughter? Is that being broadminded, George? Aren't you losing sight of what John and Ellie will be throwing away .. If they make unsuitable marriages? Well, I won't argue the point with you. But you're losing sight of the fact that they are in love. Who isn't, when he's twenty? When he is twenty. Yes. Have you forgotten how you felt, George? The day your father found out. The last time you saw her. The night we walked up the gangplank. I'm not so forgetful as all that, Roger. I haven't forgotten it, either. I had to live with you those six months abroad. Then you married Catherine. I've never regretted that, Roger. No. You shouldn't. You are very lucky to have Catherine. But remember when John was born? Remember what you said to me that day? You said. I pray to heaven he'll be happy. I remember. Then you and I went out and entered him for Groton. Yes. He isn't happy now, George. Neither is Ellie. Think how they must be feeling. Forget the iron deer. And the late Ralph Waldo Emerson. And what people will say if you miss a meeting of the Tuesday Club. Be kind, George. You always have been to everyone in trouble. You have been generous. You have been understanding. Have I, Roger? I've always. Tried to understand. Then try to understand your own children. Don't you want them to get just a little more out of life than you've had? I'm not sure how much one has a right to expect from life. It has a strange way of escaping you. Before you know it, it's .. Slipped out of your hands. Perhaps it's because we haven't stood up to it enough. It is too late for us. All that you and I can do is to hope that others .. Those we love, do better. I guess that is all I'm trying to say. Roger said you were here. Some of our guests are leaving, George. Yes. Oh yes, my dear. Yes. Catherine. - Yes, George? I've been thinking. Worcester isn't Boston. But it is in Massachusetts. [ Whistling ] Are you alone, George? I thought I heard someone whistling. I can't think who it can have been. How strange. Catherine, my dear. There is something I should like to read to you. No, it's not out of a book. It is something I've just written. It's a letter to Henry Apley. About cousin Hattie. A nice letter? I hope you'll think so, my dear. I don't want to go too far because basically my position was just, but .. Well this anyway, is just a rough beginning. "Dear Henry," "It's occurred to me in thinking things over, that we can all die only once." "As it happens I still have a little time to consider .." "Where I wish to be placed in the family plot. And cousin Hattie hasn't." "Therefore I suggest that we both adopt the motto .." "Let sleeping dogs lie." "And join our efforts in endeavouring to activate another little motto." "Which is peculiarly our own." "Bring cousin Hattie back." I think that's rather nicely put. Don't you, dear? Well, I see what you mean, George. - And then I go on .. "I know that you are in delicate health, dear Henry." "And that you will want to .." "Be near her." You know, it's a hard letter to write. Well, perhaps another way of phrasing it, dear? The idea is perfect. - Yes. - But .. Good morning. - Good morning, darling. Mother. - Ah, my dear. Father. Good morning. Isn't it a beautiful morning? I suppose it is a beautiful morning as that young man of yours is coming round? Yes. He is to spend the whole day. We are going to Faneuil Hall market to have lunch. That place where all the butchers go. Butchers? Why .. - How nice, George. Oh yes, yes. Capital. Capital! Well, what's that for? Nothing. Just a reflex. So that's what a reflex is. Behave. I'm done, Margaret. - Alright. I thought you were in Worcester seeing Mr Dole. Well, I'm going as soon as I've finished my breakfast. Good old Johnny. Wouldn't dream to ask for a maiden's hand on an empty stomach. Are you scared? Scared of what? - Mr Dole. Well, I am a little. But not really. After all, the alliance will have certain advantages for the Dole family. Hmm. What do you mean .. Hmm? Nothing. Just hmm. Thank you, Margaret. John, where are you going to live, you and Myrtle? Why, here. In this house? We'll have a house of our own, of course. I mean, here in Boston. Not me. When Howard finds another position. He'll come back here for the wedding. We'll live somewhere else. Maybe even New York is too close. I'll make him take a job in Chicago .. Missouri or Texas. We might even go to southern California. I believe they have a university there. California? Well .. isn't that verging on the radical? John. I wonder if you are going to enjoy being married to Myrtle. Eleanor. I don't understand you at all. I didn't expect you would. Isn't it wonderful to see Eleanor so happy. Yes, and John too. Yes, John too. - Thank you, my dear. Of course, I can't help feeling sorry for Agnes. When the emotions are involved my dear, someone is bound to become frustrated. This one? George. Speaking of emotions. Last night, I kept thinking about that book of Eleanor's. By the man with the queer name. It began with an "F". Oh you mean .. "Freud"? Yes, that's the name. Well, I thought it only right. That as long as Eleanor is so interested, that .. I ought to know something about it, but I couldn't find it anywhere in her room. Well .. As a matter of fact, after what she said about the book. I thought perhaps I'd better glance at it myself. Just to check up of course. And, let me see. I think perhaps I dropped it .. Back here somewhere. Ah. You know, it is really very interesting if you face it tolerantly. It advances a theory that frankly never occurred to me. What's it about? Well, it's about the mind. And the human relationships that affect the mind. What sort of relationships? I hardly know how to put it, Catherine. Well, if Eleanor has been reading it. Then I shall have to resort to a word I have never used in your presence. It seems to be very largely a book about .. Sex. But how can you write a whole book about .. That? Doctor Freud does seem to pad it a little here and there. For instance he tells this story of a certain "Mr X". It seems that this Mr X when he was four years old .. Had an experience with his nurse that colored his entire life. Now, I remember my own nurse very well. She was Margaret's sister. And I know that neither of us forgot ourselves, even for a moment. Yes, but what happened between Mr X and his nurse? Well, that's what's is so confusing. Nothing at all definite did happen. But ever after that he always dreamed of locomotives. George. The other night I had a strange dream. Yes. Perhaps you'd better not talk about it until you look this over, Catherine. It seems to be Dr Freud's idea that emotion .. that is .. Sex. Very largely governs the lives of people. In other parts of the country. Well, there is no reason to hide the book, George. No. No. I'll put it on the shelf downstairs. Next to Emerson. Come to think of it, Catherine. They've more than a little in common. Doctor Freud is trying to do the same thing with sex .. That Emerson did without it. George. George .. where are you? Oh, there you are. Is this true what I hear? John is going to marry the daughter of a mechanic from Dorchester? Who told you that? - My dear, it's all over Boston. Her father collects old iron in his front yard. Now really, Amelia. Don't attempt to deny it. I know it's true. Why else should you be conspiring in the bedroom? I'm going up to the attic. - Now, Amelia. Let her go, George. Mr Willing, sir. - Oh dear. Tell him we're not at home, Wilson. - No, Catherine. I want to see Horatio. I've a bone to pick with him. Horatio. - Yes, George? Have you heard of a man named "Freud"? - Why, no. It's occurred to me that it is probably you he's writing this whole book about. No. You've always exerted a very bad influence on me, Horatio. And if I may say, an unhealthy influence. Unhealthy? Why George, I've followed you as .. Boswell did Johnson. - Yes. We won't go into that. What really matters is that you've interfered between me and my son. But how, George? What did I do? You went snooping up to Worcester. You did. Bringing back all kinds of stories. George, you asked me to go to Worcester. Don't you remember? Yes, we won't split hairs, Horatio. Thank heavens your intrigues were unsuccessful. John is going to marry Myrtle Dole. Myrtle Dole? What about Agnes? Agnes is a nice girl, Horatio. She has inherited a certain charm. From her mother. But John is not in love with Agnes. But George, I've often heard you say that love is largely nonsense. I'm speaking of love. Real love, Horatio. Something I don't believe you have ever known in your sterile, pedestrian life. Yes, George. Well, I'd better go and talk to Agnes. I think she'll be very .. Why, it's Mr Willing, isn't it? - No. Come in, Mr Boulder. It's that telephone, Mr Apley. A long distance call. Now, who would I know at long distance? They said it was Worcester. Worcester? I will take it. Yes? Yes, I'll wait. Yes. This is Mr Apley. I do wish she wouldn't keep saying "hello". After all, I don't even know the young woman. I think the New England telephone company will .. Yes? Yes, this is Mr Apley. Mr Dole. How do you do. No. I said "how do you do". Oh, I can hear you. Do you want me to speak louder? How do you do? He heard me. Yes. John is on his way over. So am I. Delighted. By all means. No, no my dear fellow. You must have luncheon with me. Tomorrow? Good. At my club then. That's the Berkeley Club. Where is it? Why, it's just around the corner. Here. No, no. This is Beacon Street. The club is on Fairfield Street. No, no. Fairfield. "F" as in .. as in Freud. Splendid. One o'clock tomorrow at the Berkeley Club. One o'clock tomorrow. That was Mr Dole. He is lunching with me tomorrow at one o'clock at The Berkeley Club. Oh, how splendid, George. We lunch in the main dining room. Where we'll be sure to be seen. The sooner we begin to be seen together the better. To help prepare our friends. Yes, George. - Where is Eleanor? I think they went into the conservatory. They probably want to be alone, George. I suppose it's alright, this early in the morning. I'm sure it is. - Well. Yes. The main dining-room. I'll take over some of father's Madeira. Not the civil war, the Mexican war. No. Since Mr Dole is from .. Out of town, he'd probably want a Martini cocktail. You didn't know, I used to be quite famous for my Martini cocktails. No, I didn't George. There's a lot of things about me you don't know, Catherine. The whole trick is in chilling the glass first. And then resting it for five minutes .. In a bowl of finely pulverized ice. Lift them out carefully. Carefully, carefully. Or you'll break them. There. Marvelous. Mr Julian Dole is here to see you, sir. - Oh capital, capital. You may poor the Martini cocktails, Charles. - Yes, sir. Mr Dole? Mr Apley. I hope I'm not late. - My dear fellow. On the contrary. Well, this is quite an occasion. Mr Dole - Mr Newcombe. My brother-in-law. How do you do, Mr Dole. - Very glad to know you, I'm sure. Will you join me in a Martini cocktail? Well if it's all the same to you, I'd prefer some sherry. Sherry? Oh, of course. Charles, will you bring some sherry into the main lounge? Yes, Mr Apley. Will you join us after luncheon, Roger? - Yes. The way, Mr Dole. You may leave those, Charles. On the sound New England principle of waste not .. want not. Yes, sir. And this is the main lounge. Say, that's a fine Gilbert Stuart you have there. Yes. Yes, it is a Stuart. Frankly, I never cared much for his portraits. Too saccharine. Prefer Copley. He painted what he saw. This happens to be my great grandfather, Moses Apley. That's exactly my point. Only Gilbert Stuart could make a dancing master .. Out of a two-fisted old pirate like Moses Apley. Did you say "pirate", Mr Dole? Oh, I don't mean it literally of course. But after all, when a man could trade rum for slaves in Africa .. Slaves for molasses in Jamaica .. And bring back that molasses to Boston to be made into more rum. So he could start in all over again. That's what I call a go-getter. A go-getter? Yes. I don't believe I've heard the expression. You don't play poker? - No. Well a go-getter is just the opposite of a standpatter. Now .. meaning no offence of course, Mr Apley. But I'd size you up as a standpatter. You play them exactly as they were dealt you. Yes. Yes, indeed. Oh, I believe I have your chair, George. Mr Willing - Mr Dole. Mr Dole. - Very glad to know you, Mr Willing. How do you do? You see, Mr Apley. You see what I mean? Someone dealt you that chair, probably before you were born. You've been playing it ever since. Yes. I see what you mean. It's an interesting theory. I .. oh .. Thank you. - Your good health. Happy days. A cigar. No. No thanks. I never use them. Perhaps you'd like to try a cigarette? - I'm afraid I .. Well, perhaps. First of all, Mr Dole. I want you to know that we're delighted. Perfectly delighted. My son has spoken to you of course? - Yes. Yes. John and I had a nice little visit. Of course, I had seen him before. Well, he was just another boy around the house. For the last two years the house has been full of boys. Have to brush them off the porch every night. To tell you the truth, I had no idea of all this myself until last week. I don't know what your ideas may be. Yours and Mrs Dole's. And I hope you won't mind me suggesting this. But I thought perhaps it might be better. If the announcement of the engagement were to be made in Boston. Rather than in Worcester. Well, isn't it customary for the bride's parents .. Oh yes, yes. Of course. I was just thinking of the simplest way to explain matters here. I thought if you and Mrs Dole can go so far as to take an apartment in Boston. And then if the announcement would be made from there. I honestly see no reason why Worcester should be brought into it at all. I see. Tell me, Mr Dole. You weren't born in Worcester? No, no. I moved there ten years ago when I bought the tool and die works. Oh yes. The tool and die works. Where did you come from? - Kansas City. Kansas? - Missouri. I see. Mr Apley. You didn't explain the advantages of .. Mrs Dole and myself taking an apartment in Boston. Well for one thing, before any definite announcement were made. It would help for us to be seen together here and there. By way of preparation. For instance, I don't think it would be difficult .. To get you a six month membership here at the club. Really? And then I'm not sure, but it might just be possible form Mrs Dole .. To be invited for several weeks to my wife's sewing circle. And naturally, there are the receptions and teas. And a series of small dinners. - Small dinners? Exactly. We must be careful. To have everyone prepared for the engagement .. Before it is actually announced. I think it can be done. Of course it isn't usual, but I think it can be done. Well, it certainly sounds interesting, Mr Apley. It's really a shame to have to pass up the opportunity. How's that? This is going to surprise you, Mr Apley. But I don't think it will work. What is that, sir? You've never met my daughter, have you. No. - Well, Myrtle is .. She is not the sewing-circle type, if you know what I mean. To be perfectly frank with you I don't think she'd be happy in Boston. From what I've seen of your son I don't think he'd be happy out of it. A nice boy, John. And I don't doubt his affection for my daughter but .. Well let me put it this way. Twenty years from now, I don't think I could stand .. Having a son-in-law quite as impressive as you are. Are you .. serious about this, Mr Dole? Dead serious, Mr Apley. You must see what I mean. I felt it when I talked to John and again when I walked into this club. It's .. It is a question of environment isn't it? Of manners .. points of view. One's whole approach to life. How would you feel if you had to live in Kansas City? I must confess I have never considered such a possibility. Of course you hadn't. No more than Myrtle really considered the possibility of living in Boston. Come now, Mr Apley. You know I'm right, don't you. Don't you? You have done me a great favor, Mr Dole. You have reminded me of something I never should have forgotten. Then we're agreed. I am very grateful to you. I wasn't thinking on a straight line. But you've set me back upon the right track. Thank you. Good for you. Well, it seems rather pointless going through with the luncheon, doesn't it. I'll run along. I've enjoyed meeting you and I mean it. There is just one thing. John is not likely to agree with us. He and your daughter might try to do something foolish. You're right. There is just time. I can catch the 1:45 to Worcester. Myrtle will be on the train for California this evening. Splendid. She has an aunt out there. She'll stay a year, two years if necessary. Well goodbye, Mr Apley. It's been a real pleasure. And I'm sorry things didn't turn out differently. Goodbye, Mr Dole. George. I owe you an apology, Horatio. Why, George. I've just been taught a lesson. It is my fault. I had to learn it from a man who is not .. one of us. From Mr Dole, George? I tried my best to do what others thought was right. No-one can say I didn't try. - I'm sure you must have, George. Environment, points of view. One's approach to life. I dismissed them, Horatio. I ignored them as if they didn't exist. Fortunately, it is not too late. I can still do what I think. What I know to be right. John shall marry Agnes. Really, George? - We will arrange the wedding for June. And Eleanor must be put Howard Boulder out of her mind. I shall send her abroad. Abroad? Yes. For confused thinking, there is nothing like a sea voyage. Now let me see. Catherine will be busy with John's wedding. Perhaps Amelia could take Eleanor abroad? That is if Roger could spare her for six months or so? I'm quite sure he could. Then that's the way it will be. Each to his kind. Each to his kind, Horatio. Amelia. - Catherine. Ellie. Oh, we've missed you so. Roger. - Hello. Good to have you back with us, Ellie. - Thank you, father. You must tell us all about your trip. We are longing to hear. There isn't much to tell. We saw the Vatican and the Uffizi and the Louvre. And the British Museum. We spent a great deal of time at the British Museum. In London, we stayed at Garlands Hotel, of course. On the very first day we must have run into .. At least six Boston people who were staying there too. How wonderful, Amelia. - Yes. It was just as though we had never left Boston at all. Travel is so broadening, I always say. I .. I don't suppose there are any letters for me? No, dear. Are you sure? Yes, I forwarded everything to Europe just as you said. I see .. thank you, mother. Well, I'm a little tired now. I think I'll go to my room. And thank you aunt Amelia. I had a wonderful time. Really, I did. A pleasure, my dear. Well, come along Roger. I want to go home. I expect to find everything in a state of confusion. Well, if it isn't, it will be. Goodbye, George. Glad you're home, Amelia. Strange about those letters, George. Didn't that young fellow try to write her? Well, as a matter of fact he did. I thought it advisable to return them. Unopened, of course. With a covering letter explaining things tactfully from our point of view. Yes, I know your tactful letters, George. In any case, it is all water over the dam, Roger. Eleanor has quite forgotten Mr Boulder by now. Yes, That is why she is so happy. Roger! - Coming. My dear. Goodbye, George. Hello Agnes. Mother said you were coming over. Ellie. Oh, I'm glad you're back. I wouldn't miss your wedding for anything. You .. you must be very happy, Agnes. Oh .. I am. How is John? He's fine. Of course, he's been very busy with examinations. So he hasn't been in much. I'll have to sew this ruffle, Miss Willing. - Oh. Oh, alright, Mrs Ruddock. Isn't that .. Your great grandmother's wedding dress? I thought I recognised it. It looks wonderful on you. Do you really think so? No. It looks awful. Oh, Ellie. I've been wondering if we should go through with this wedding. But of course you must. And have him hate me for the rest of his life? You will make him a perfect wife. - Looking like this? There is nothing wrong with your looks, Agnes. John seems to think so. - John is an idiot. You would be lovely if you had some nice clothes. That's what cousin Catherine said. And she's talked your father into taking me to buy some in New York. Father .. in New York? If you think .. clothes will make any difference. Of course they will. But not if you let father choose them. You do it. Including a new wedding dress. This is his grandmother's dress. Won't his feeling be hurt? He's not getting married in it. You are. You've got to fight, Agnes. It's always a mistake not to fight. Perhaps if I'd fought hard enough, I .. I know, Ellie. Oh, I am so sorry. Remember, Agnes. Fight. I had no idea New York was so big. Oh yes. It's big. Ah, here we are. Now remember. We mustn't tell them where we're from. We don't want to appear to be boasting. No, cousin George. Boston. - Certainement. What can I do for you, Monsieur? - Well .. We thought we would .. that is .. We'd like to see some evening dresses. This way, Monsieur. Oh, it's beautiful. You like it, my dear? I've always dreamed of having a dress like that. That would suit mademoiselle very well. I think we should start with something a little less radical. Oh please, cousin George. Well .. Perhaps with a little tulle? - No. No tulle. - No tulle, Agnes? That's been the trouble with me all my life. Too much tulle. From now on it's going to be different. We'll take it just as it is. And I want to see some more dresses. I want to see a great many more. - Yes. Yes, mademoiselle. Agnes, I don't know what has come over you. It's this, cousin George. If John has got to marry to me at least he needn't be ashamed of me. Perhaps I can change the inside. I'll have to see about that. But I can change the outside. I can give him at least part of what he's entitled to. I can give him an attractive wife. Well, my dear. If you think it is so important. There will probably be no harm in .. Well, it can't hurt us to look at some, can it. Oh, cousin George! We are quite ready to see anything you have to show us. Yes, Monsieur. Well, I hope we did the right thing. - Of course we did, cousin George. I don't know what you're aunt Amelia will say. Next week I'll be a married woman. No matter what my aunt Amelia says. Now, suppose we go back to the hotel and change. And then have a little dinner at Delmonico?s. It's quite gay you know. Wonderful. I think I might even call on my old classmate Mike Walker. He married an actress. A real actress, cousin George? Well she was, I believe, what is called a Floradora girl. I can see no objection to asking them to join us at dinner. Especially New York. Yes. I think we might paint the town just a little red tonight. Well look who is here. Mr George Apley. And Miss Willing. How do you do, Mr Apley? Let me present my friends. Mr Kelly. Mr Leach. Mr Goldsmith. How do you do. - All from Yale, Mr Apley. Boola boola boys. Say, have I ever told you gentlemen about Mr Apley? You've all heard of Boston haven't you? The hub of the universe. Mr Apley is the gentleman who spins the hub and makes the wheel go round. Mr Apley caught the sacred codfish and hung them in the State house. Mr Apley invented baked beans for breakfast. It is Mr Apley who won't allow his fellow citizens .. To see your play or read your novel or admire your painting. It's Mr Apley who kicks you off your lecture platform. As you try to pump some vitality into the carcass of the late Ralph Waldo Emerson. It is Mr Apley who has turned the Boston apartment at Thurrock and Garrison .. Into a provincial village that even Cotton Mather would consider medieval. You stop that! You have no right to talk to him like that. I'm sorry, Miss Willing. Perhaps I haven't. I beg your pardon. Are you going to call Mr Walker, cousin George? No. No, my dear. I think we'll dine here at the hotel. Cousin George, you know why, don't you. I know it's none of my business. But he couldn't have meant any of those things he said. He wouldn't have said them at all if he hadn't been hurt. Hurt, my dear? It is terrible to love someone. To have something stand in the way. It is the most terrible thing in the world. Please try to understand. I know how I felt about John. Well, that's the way Mr Boulder feels. That's why he was so rude and awful. It?s the way Eleanor feels, cousin George. I suppose it's the way John felt when Myrtle's father sent her away. It's the way you must have felt when your father made you go abroad. Agnes. Cousin Catherine told me all about it. How long have you and Catherine been discussing me behind my back? Oh, it wasn't anything like that. She was only trying to help me. I wish I could understand. But you can, cousin George. If you would only do what you know is right. You can be so wonderful. Like this afternoon when we bought the dresses. And then, other times, you .. You are not yourself. Not myself, Agnes? It's as if half the time you are trying to be .. Someone else. Someone that isn't you at all. Good heavens. Is everyone in Boston here today? Next to a good funeral, there is nothing a Bostonian likes better than a wedding. Ellie, dear. Hello, Sarah. But you are looking so well, my dear. That is, we haven't seen anything of you for so long. I've been to Europe, you know. Yes, we heard. Isn't this all exciting? John and Agnes. Who would have dreamed he would have been getting married before you. You don't suppose Agnes has backed out, do you? Thirty years ago when I married your aunt Amelia in this church .. The very same possibility occurred to me. But she didn't. - No, she didn't. They don't. I wonder what father and Agnes were doing in New York all this past week. I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea. - I know. It is all so mysterious. They only got back this morning. I haven't even seen Agnes. Well, you'll see a great deal of her from now on, my boy. Marriage is a very serious step. Isn't it, sir? The great thing about marriage my boy, is not to think too much about it. Yes, sir. Well, I see you got here alright. Yes, my dear. When you come back from Europe next fall .. Why don't you come down to my shooting camp at Dover for a week or two? Well, thank you, sir. But I'm not very fond of shooting. Neither was I. Before I got married. Ellie my dear, will you come with me for a minute. Of course, father. Oh, Howard. Oh. Oh I'm sorry, father. I couldn't help it. I know my dear, a reflex. Now, you've two hours to pack and catch the steamer. The Captain can marry you. Steamer? - He knows all about it. But these are John and Agnes's tickets. Where will they go? They can go to the Farragut House at Rye Beach just as your mother and I did. Come along, darling. Mr Apley, when you called me in New York .. I didn't get a chance to apologise for the things I said. Nonsense, my boy. You were perfectly right. Especially when you called Boston the hub of the universe. Now you must hurry. Run along, quick. Goodbye, father. - Goodbye. Oh, George. Why didn't you tell me? - To tell you the truth, Catherine .. I was afraid to confide in anyone for fear I should talk myself out of it. You know. I've noticed lately that I've a tendency to try and by someone other than myself. A most deplorable tendency. Emerson opposed it all his life. Be yourself, he said, and the world is your oyster. You know, in his way .. Emerson was something of a radical. Yes, George. George, there is something I must show you. What is it, Horatio? - Look for yourself. Catherine. Look. That is Henry Apley in our pew. I can see. - But who put him there? He doesn't belong in our pew. He belongs several pews back. Yes, I know, but .. But this is outrageous. I insist that he move back. Emerson .. - What? Emerson, George. Oh. Well. I wish you'd learn to mind your own business, Horatio. Horatio. - What is it, Jane? They ?re ready. Ready for what? Horatio. - Oh, yes. Of course. How do you do, Henry. I'm glad I ran into you, Henry. I happened to be out at Mount Auburn last week. I think I've found just the place for cous?n Hattie. Dearly beloved. We are gathered together here in the sight of God. And in the face of this company. To join together this man and this woman .. In Holy matrimony. T-G ??
