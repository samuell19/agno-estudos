She's my girlfriend Those women have lots of men who send money Bet she does too She can't afford love sorry Tell me about Cambodia What? How do people live there? They constantly eat and offer you food. Food's important They're never alone They're always in a group. Even asleep The whole family sleeps in one room If they had to sleep alone they'd feel weird They even use the same toothbrush I send her 150 a month In return, she got a new job Doing what? Working at a beer garden On commission If more customers drink her brand she earns more And no men? No. That's our contract Ah. Contract Your head back in Cambodia? What does life cost in Phnom Penh? In a factory she'd earn n 50 or 60 a month But she takes care of her family What does her mother do? She gambles Cards What's up? Did something happen? Could you have caught it? Yes You have to get tested I know Listen, your 3 months are almost up You'll get Claudia's editor's job Sign the contract today Then we'll insure you against disability You want to hire me as a staff editor?

I'm getting an HIV test I'm sorry No worries I'll cross my fingers All the best See you What's that? For my new visa You're going back? Sreykeo is HIV positive And you? I get the results in 5 days Then I go to Cambodia What if you're positive? I'll still go That's just so romantic Just romantic or plain stupid Should I get tested? The toothbrush I don't think so, but I'll let you know Did I miss something? Think about it Once she starts the meds she has to keep taking them Forever If she stops the virus could become resistant But in Cambodia only Stavudine is available With 1000 side effects Nerve damage to the arms and legs It's not even used in Germany anymore It's well tolerated at first but less effective and those side effects Trust me, AZT is much better AZT is not available in Cambodia I want the supplier's name All the many HIV cases here take Stavudine Why should this girl get anything else? She's my girlfriend We'll gladly enroll your girlfriend in our program but if our drugs aren't good enough I know you can get AZT from the supplier Be reasonable Stavudine is always available but AZT... That's why I need a reliable source I'll buy them but where! That's not our job I don't give a shit! Give me the damn address We're building wells in rural areas of Cambodia so our aid worker can't join your HIV program here in Phnom Penh No problem You can buy the drugs for her directly from our importer That's possible? Of course Oh, shit Your boyfriend can't work any more He has stomach ache very weak But... I love him. And he loves me We'll keep that in mind Okey dokey in Cambodia? More or less This is Vanessa Hello, Vanessa You two study together? No. Why? Whatever I'll just close this What about Lilli? Vanessa is less stressful And you? UN ambassador for human rights and development aid? How's things in Phnom Penh? Thanks, Dr. House. Everything's fine Her viral load is dropping Her family wants me to marry her and farm rice So now you don't know what to do? No, I just don't know I thought it would work out, but there's no solution I go there, I come back I go again. I'm out of money Right What do you think? Make a list What's on the pro side? Life with her will never be boring. Sex? Really? Yes She's special, that's a fact What else? She loves me as lam All women say they love you for who you are OK, one plus. Con? She lives in Asia, I live in Europe That could be a pro... So, con? You can barely communicate She costs money She can't, or rather shouldn't, have children She's a Cambodian ex-prostitute who is going to die of AIDS. That's a fact Current medical lore says she'll live another 25 years, max if she gets the right medication Now consider your age Damn, I don't believe it German? Good in Phnom Penh? You speak German? Yes. Good Happy Happy Your turn Listen, Ben I'll send you to Asia at the magazine's expense You'll do an article on luxury hotels and meanwhile, you write your story Young backpacker meets fallen girl... You know, AIDS and so on All for good reason We'll pay separately and you keep the copyright You should invest to get ahead I can't do that Of course you can Sell it elsewhere and cash in I have to ask Sreykeo. It's her story too Do that. But don't wait long BTW those are mine Yeah. Got it Shit Want to watch? otherwise we'll watch porn During Advent? Especially during Advent! From a German You speak German well And the German man lives here? No She opens the door to the disco looks around, sees a man at the bar goes right to him, says buy me a glass of bubbly I thought, OK, two glasses of champagne Then she drank it down in one gulp and said, now I want to dance I don't like to dance But we danced. We even danced well And ever since I've held her close Two years later, Henry came along We got married and soon you arrived That's our story Your mother always knew what she wanted It's for you She called me poppa Why is he going outside? For privacy. Let him be You're beautiful Thank you Your French is excellent I'm a teacher Would you like to sleep with me tonight? Take the money! I've got lots of money Why won't you look at me? You agreed to come with me So don't make a fuss now What's wrong? I gave you money Don't make me use force Or would you rather go with foreigners? It's the best hotel in Kuala Lumpur Wear something nice, write the article and don't forget the hotel is paying for everything While you're there you can figure out how to write your own story Got it? Loan hand in expense receipts? Receipts for AIDS drugs would not go over well here Get it? I can't do it We just split up. I can't just go and pretend it's fine and then cash in on our story. That's bad Break-ups happen but it's a good story You can't just leave her behind You'll feel guilty your whole life that you just cut her off as if it hadn't happened First promises, then bam I didn't make promises So you think like big brother here But she might see it differently Be honest You really made no promises? I promised I'd help and I did that What do you think? Me? I don't see that as a promise More... like an agreement or a contract I see And then one side just cancels it? She still works as a bar-girl although I send money. She broke our contract It was your contract By German law. Hamburg jurisdiction That contract applies to her? What security does she have? Should she wait for you all her life? At least be real Go lay your cards on the table This to and fro is pointless End the relationship with dignity Then everybody knows what's what that's her right Phnom Penh, Cambodia Heitmann speaking Ditto Are you mad? Totally? First you want to go, then you don't Now you break off the trip? I need time to for my book I'm writing our story The hotel asked where you are It's totally embarrassing including for me They'll fire you I don't care I'll find a job in Cambodia Today Benjamin and Sreykeo live in Cambodia and Germany. They have a son. He is healthy. 4
