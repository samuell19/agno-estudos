Robin Hood. The king of thieves, his eyes disguised as king of beasts whose lion heart beats bravery is tracking prize parking his ride under a no-parking-sign. Never mind the fine, Didn't I say that guy was brave? Today's the day he makes his way into the cave right through the front gate. Like "What's up, mate?" Ain't no Maid Marian Marriage gonna be happ'ning today. There's business to do, savings to save. His palms start to sweat, he takes a deep breath and beneath his mask his heart races so fast he'd rather start an IRA than do the task at hand. But since bank rates are rather bad for outcasts and bow and arrow outdated, from past he flings out his blaster like "Hands up, you bastards!" Says "Hip hip-hooray!" today's payday. Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly what a day. When you're the namesake - for Christ's sake of Batman's sidekick spreadin' heartache to them snakes that the banks make is your yardstick Then you're no lunatic you're taking the straight way and steal for the poor's sake. It's for the sake of the needy that you take from the greedy. Because what is the robbing of a bank compared to the founding of a bank? No need to thank the king, robbin' the rich is just his thing his wish, His dream! And his dreams he will chase 'til this lion's heartbeat fades. But 'til then he'll be yelling: Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly what a day. Majestic! What a slam! He isn't rusty at all, he still got it! Ladies and gentlemen, our titleholder, John Gerber! Let's check the score! Wow! That's a 9.6! Okay everybody! Hey, great job, man! Congrats, John! Robin Hood, huh? Search the building again! No comment at the moment. No comment! No comment! John, I'm Alicia! I have a blog dedicated to your work. It's called "Whiterabbit". Do you have a short statement for your fans? Yeah, John, do you? I guess not. Step out of the way please, ma'am. Or would you like to come with us? John! It's called Whiterabbit! Google me! Google it! Where is your son? He wasn't at the show. Where is he? I made it to the semi-finals. Congrats, John. Where is Robin? Is your son still alive? I have to do the semi-finals. I've got an ID. Have you seen the new guy? A child's killer they said. How can he be playing basketball right now? Not sure I'd call that playing basketball. Mrs. Gerber, I should tell you that we have a therapist we can refer you to - You're not getting rid of me til you've found my son. Fair enough. So, there was a bank robbery last week. Apparently, the perpetrators wore lion masks - like in John's poem. Are you telling me my son robbed a bank, Officer Rosenbaum? It's better than that: The bank is in Cape Town, South Africa. They're still looking for the "heroes" who did it. I need to speak to John! We're wasting time here. Calling Officer Rosenbaum's methods a waste of time is a little harsh, don't you think? Officer Fischer. Mrs. Gerber. You were right. I don't know how you missed this in the first place but he booked two flights out of Czech Republic. Prague Airport. They just confirmed the ID. - What? - When? A week ago. They were already flying when you reported Robin missing. To South Africa? I just informed the South African Police. Provide them with the intel we have to support their search. Especially on how he could show up on the stage out of nowhere. Any reason you could think of, why your husband would take your son to South Africa? I need to talk to him. Rob! Rob! We gotta go! Next basket wins, yeah? What are you writing? Something about basketball. You and your basketball. Well it is my list, dad. Dinner's ready, dad. What rhymes with "legend"? What are you writing? Something for mom. She already has a thousand poems from you, dad. Mom likes my poems. That's how I - you "won her over back then", I know. You okay? Yeah, I just choked. Take your time, big guy. So, do you think mom is gonna come? I don't know. Maybe. I guess, I kind of miss her a little bit. I miss mom too. That's why I'm writing. When I miss someone I write. When I'm sad I write. It helps. Then maybe I'll write her my own poem. Can I tell her where we are? Tell her, but ehm... in a secret code. Make sure only she can understand the code. Oh, what did you write about basketball? Wow, hey! You write yours and I write mine, okay? Dreamland. "Dreamland" sort of rhymes with "legend". Dreamland... That's good. The legends they wander on beaches of fine sand, along their lone dreamland... for wonders to see where there's no one to see them. Their faith and their fate they search for their freedom. Legends never fade. The art of hoping isn't hard to master hands ban days past letter for letter gonna live forever. Not stopping ever. Everything's better than waiting. Forever. John! Stop! The heart is still strong, if claws are in form, then. John! Dreams are not torn venom in veins... Where is Robin? When you find the way... Where is our son? I hope he's not in vain. Is he alive? I have to do the semi-finals. Where's our son, John? John! You better tell me right now what the hell you've done with my son. Please follow me and please sit down, okay? You better hope they gonna keep you in here forever! The arrest of poetry slam champion. John Gerber, who is the only suspect in the kidnapping of his son, twelve-year-old Robin Gerber. Robin has been missing for one week... Good evening, Mrs. Gerber. Always in training, huh? Tell me there's news?! Well, eh... do you have any plans tomorrow night? Why? I'm going to see John at the semi-finals. I'll get us two backstage passes if you like. You should be trying to find my son, not satisfying John's demands! You have to grill him night and day! May I? Excuse me? Impressive. You should see my dunk. The thing is, I'm not as good at this as you are, the pro. But I don't give you advice in your area of expertise. I'd appreciate you extending me the same courtesy. I could "grill" John night and day but he's not gonna tell me anything. Legends in dreamland that tells me something. He's telling us a story, Mrs. Gerber. In code. So let's go there right now. To South Africa? This is just part of the story. The next part could take us somewhere else completely. So we're supposed to just stand here and wait? We're supposed to listen. He's going to lead us to Robin, Mrs. Gerber. I promise. His poems have always been his world. Who rides there so late through the night dark and drear? The father it is, with his infant so dear; He holdeth the child tightly clasp'd in his arms, he holdeth him tight, he keepeth him warm. You don't look like a child killer. You're too weak. Mr. Poetry Champion! Who rides there so late through the night dark and drear? The father it is with his infant so dear. He holdeth the child tightly clasp'd in his arms... What? You think, because I'm Polish I don't know Erlking? Or Goethe? You throw crap, you know. Come on. Come on. See? Crap. Not everyone's a natural born basketball player. You sound like a pussy. Aaaaaaah! Slow down! Dad, stop! Drive in the middle of the road! Come on, let me drive! Look at the road when you're driving, man! Eyes front! Eyes closed! Noo! Look ahead! Slow down! Rob? Rob! Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Sorry. No, it's alright... everything's fine. Driving a car - check! Barfing on the ground afterwards - check! Can we go again? Nonono. Let's take a break, okay? I'm still on the verge of having a heart attack. Weak. Here. Good thing mom didn't see that. She would have freaked out. Is that your poem for mom? Woah, stop it! I'm not finished yet! Looks good. Maybe you can perform it in front of an audience one day! Wait, wait, really? Are you serious? Yeah! I'll take you on to the finals some day! That would be so cool! Wait. You're writing that down? Seriously? Yeah! For when we get back. Mom wants me to be optimistic. Alright. What do you say we get back to adventuring? Only if I can drive! Three billion beats. The cadence of your heart. Constant, rhythmic, irreversible. The countdown of a lifetime. Countless beats decrease this period this one-time experience piece by piece by piece. Period. Three billion beats. The cadence of your heart. A metronome setting a start and end but until then, the tone, the tune, is yours to choose you alone compose the flow you conduct the highs and lows. The biographic symphony Tick tock your heartbeat clock our days are numbered be unencumbered do not go gentle into that good night. Time's hunting you like cats mice do so make your walk of life a run! Shake your fate, pave it with the things you've done... So listen to your heart beating start treating those fleeting days as chapters in a book each one repeating a dream from the list you're completing. Smell the salt in the air Make sure you take care to hear the cadence... Inhale the fragrance of what it's like to be King among kings. You have no fear. Your heart may skip, your heart may burst it may even stand still but 'til then remember first it started with a roadtrip to Madiba's Abode. You're growing, you're big enough to slay a giant you're flying you ain't crying how susceptible you are to doubt and dread scepter in hands, you're the king of king's head Do not go gentle it is time to fight. The list may be long the hours tight so get to it pursue it I know you can do it. Tick tock your hearbeat clock. Time is playing cat-and-mouse all the same you're a lion in this game, untamed predator, not prey Not afraid of pain nor of dying. Not tired of life nor of the fight your fighting. You rage against the dying of the light. When the heartbeat clock strikes. Three billion beats minus X. The champ. John Gerber! Congratulations, John! Looks like you'll be competing at the finals! But now, we all wanna know one thing... are you gonna be bringing your groupies again? Okay, okay, I'm teasing... Alright, poetry lovers, we shall meet at the championship finals! Can I go to the bathroom? Sure, just make it fast. I'm on the first plane to Cape Town tomorrow. Because of a poem? Because of all the clues he just left all over the stage! And since when have you become a poetry professor? This whole show is just bullshit. Tomorrow you get Gerber to talk and then find that boy. Low profile. Mrs. Gerber, can I ask you some questions? No, thanks. It's for my blog, "Whiterabbit". I said no. Are John's texts based on actual events? Please stop. Are these slams true? It's enough! Well, what do you feel when you listen to him? Do you think that-hey! Sounds like John's describing a journey a boy might like? It's not a journey, it's a goddamn kidnapping! Maybe we should take him to the zoo again. He didn't draw bars... in the zoo, there are bars. He didn't draw bars. That's what you call artistic freedom. No, it's what you call freedom. Maybe we should take him to the slam next week? Or to a match? We have to get him out of there. That's what I'm saying. We have to get him out of the clinic. John! If anyone can cure his cancer, it's these people. And these people just told us that no one can cure his cancer! You're giving up on him! It's terminal. The doctor said so today. Any day could be his last day. This day could be in a month. Or a year, John. But he needs the next chemo - For years we've been putting our faith in the "next chemo" and the next chemo! These pills make him suffer! We are not going to play with his life! That's exactly it! It's his life. And his time! And it's our responsibility, John! He needs the meds. He doesn't want the meds! He doesn't even want the heart monitor, he... an ending in this clinic is not what he wants. Stop talking about endings! Can you live with the idea of our son never leaving that room again? No. I could not live with that. But I know he can get through this! And you should too. Hey, dad. Hi, Rob. I was just having a great dream. I could fly! Wow. Sounds like a great dream. Yeah. Until someone had the great idea to wake me up. No! Where is this guy? How are you feeling? Well... if I didn't know any better... I'd say great. At least it's friday. They have chocolate chips in the pudding on friday. Highlight of my week... every week. Someone is feeling a little grumpy today? Let's play a game. "Rhyme-time"? I ll go first: Friday. X-ray... boring. Drawing. Artist. Wish list. Sodium hydrogen carbonate. Okay, you win. Wanna see something? Yeah. What's this? I wanna see real lions, dad. When I get out of here. I wanna do everything that's on this list! Oh, wait! Flying! That sounds cool. Wait. Where's mom? Is she coming? Nah, this is gonna be a father-son adventure. Alright, so we've got: Robin Hood. Oo-de-lally! And you are Little John! Alright. Driving a car? You wanna drive a car? Okay. So we've got driving, Robin Hood, seeing real lions, flying... what was the other thing? Oh, ehm, nothing... Come on, you can tell me. No it's... it's stupid... Dude! Try me. What was it? Okay. Ehm. I heard you and mom talking... And...? She said you've lost hope. I'm going to find it for you. Let's go find hope. Officer Rosenbaum wants to see you. Hey! I'd like to visit John Gerber. And I would like to visit Donald Trump. Give him a piece of my mind. What? But I'd have to observe the visiting hours. And ours are in... already seven hours! Please, have a seat. It started with a roadtrip to Madiba's Abode. You're growing, you're big enough to slay a giant you're flying, you ain't crying how susceptible you are to doubt and dread scepter in hands you're the king of king's head. "King" is lion, right? So "King's Head" is Lion's Head, right? In Cape Town. Is he still there? Tick, tock, John! Time is running! Is your son still alive? Is his heart still beating? You need to tell us where he is, John! What is the matter with you?! You need an audience in order to talk? I can bring some people in. Is the spotlight not bright enough for you? I have an interview appointment with John Gerber. I cleared it with Officer Rosenbaum. Okay. Then I'll send Mr. Gerber right into the make-up room. New plan: You have an interview with me. Now. And lose my spot in line? No way! Come on! Bye, Steve! Bye, Steve! Thanks for all the help! Hurry up. I gotta get to the airport. Jump in. You think I'm that easy, huh? Well, I had a look at your "Whiterabbit" blog. And you've got quite the archive of his work, haven't you? All his new stuff, yeah. The old performances are only partly online. You're flying to South Africa? I need all of your videos. What do I get in return? How about I don't arrest you for your obstructing my investigation? Your bark ist bigger than your bite. My daughter had a rabbit, that was eaten by a dog. So tell me, are you planning on streaming the finals live on your blog? A new fan? How sweet. We're searching for his kid. Wow. Looking for evidence in poems. That must hurt. They're about Robin. Yeah. All of John's poems are about Robin! Guess it helped him cope with the disease and all that. Send me the videos. Are you bribing me, Officer? Don't flatter yourself. It's for your ride home. You're kidding. Just send me the videos. Please. As soon as you can. Thank you. Officer Malango? Please call me Ayanda. Ayanda. Officer Rosenbaum. A pleasure to finally meet you in person. Yes, you too. I see you brought a lady? I guess we're heading in the same direction. What are you doing here?! I'm finding my son. And you are not going to stop me. I wouldn't dare. So what have you found in his poem, Ayanda? Welcome to Dreamland. Hey! I think I got something. Rob's chemo meds! Hey! The landlord remembers a red pick up, just like the getaway car from the bank robbery. When? Over a week ago, Mrs. Gerber. Ayanda, I have something here that I'd like you to listen to. It's a recording of John from last night. Okay. Hang on one second. Yo. White man can rap, eh! Rewind, rewind. "It started with a roadtrip from Madiba's Abode" - Madiba's Abode! That's a home for sick children. Where is that? Khayelitsha Township. Hello guys! Hello! Hello! Thank you, Jabula. Robin drew this the day before he went missing. Are you sure? Excuse me. Are you sure you don't remember the boy who drew this picture? He would've been with his father. I don't remember. We have many foreign volunteers coming to the centre to help. Would you mind showing me the backrooms, please? She's asking if you want to play with her. Play with her. Children might know. Did you know my son Robin? No! He was here last week. Have you seen him? Hey Robin, Robin! Who rides there so late through the night dark and drear? The father it is, with his infant so dear; He holdeth the boy tightly clasp'd in his arms, he holdeth him safely, he keepeth him - hey! Ahh, you're getting better! Pussy has some balls now? Hey, some break. You want to beat your mom at baketball? Must be an old lady, huh? Put that down. That's why you train like crazy? That is mine. Oh some more pussy poetry... Is it the list from your son, John? Who rides there so late through the night dark and drear? The pussy it is, with his - Oopsala. Not my fault. It's cool man! Fine! Fine, fine, fine! Stop it! Gerber! Iwanow! Enough! Pussy started! Pussy! Shut up! Shut up! Everyone knows, how the Goethe poem ends, John! Everyone knows! Are you listening, John? The father now gallops, with terror half wild, he grasps in his arms the poor shuddering child; He reaches his courtyard with toil and with dread, the child in his arms finds he motionless, dead. Top floor. Panorama terrace. Wait, we're already at the top? What do you mean "already"? Wow. Robin. No. I hate it. Hey, come on! Come on, you know what mom would say. Is this your poem for mom? Is it okay if I read it? "The king of the clouds." "This king is scared of gravity. He has four legs, and claws, twenty..." Robin! Robin! Rob! Stop, stop! Wait! Come on. Don't be afraid. Wooooh! Yeaaah! I shouldn't have brought you here. No... I brought you here, dad. We have to go home, Rob. What?! What - no! No no no no no! There are four more things on that list! You promised that we do everything! Beating mom in basketball is going to be very difficult from down here. There's no poetry slam that I know of that I can just get you into... And we already flew down here, so you can scratch that off your list, okay? No! No, I don't mean that kind of flying and you know that! I mean like all by myself. Like in my dream! We'll complete the list when we're home, okay? When you're better. I know that you don't believe that yourself. I heard you talking to mom. But I don't want to die in the hospital. You are too sick, Rob. I know! I want to keep adventuring. But how can I have a father-son-adventure without my dad? Okay. Let's fly. I understand. Yes. I hear you are a basketball champion? And quite a show-off! Crap. Fischer's just ordered me to come back. Immediately. What? John just attacked another inmate. They've tightened his conditions. No more lenience; No more final. But we need his last poem! Why can't you just refuse? I have to obey the rules. Screw the rules! It's about finding my son! Orders are orders, unfortunately. Do whatever you want but I will stay here. Why am I not surprised? I would appreciate your help, Miriam. You know your husband better than anyone else. But we need John's last text. I'll talk to Fischer and I will make sure that John is on that stage! Mr. Gerber is now isolated from other inmates. We're gonna keep you updated about further developments. Any questions? What about the final? Have you heard from Officer Rosenbaum? Is it true that Miriam Gerber traveled to Africa to search for their son? I don't have any information on that matter. Do you think she has a better chance of finding Robin? Because she understands John's texts? Guesswork. What are the chances the boy is still alive? Come on, guys. Don't you think John Gerber was only trying to help his son? That's the way he puts it in his poems. Officer Rosenbaum! Any news from South Africa? Ehm... we're close. We're just missing on final piece. To answer your very first question. Mr. Gerber will not be permitted to perform at tonight's final. This press conference is over. Thanks. Officer Fischer. Gerber has to perform tonight! I told you on the phone: Not gonna happen! I'm not gonna be his groupie again! It's our last chance! The press is going crazy about this case! And I won't lose my face for another Gerber show. Your face, you're gonna loose your balls! Do you like your job, Rosenbaum? With all due respect, Sir. This poem completes the puzzle. Trust me! No. This completes the puzzle. What's this? It's John's. He lost it in the fight. Forget your poems, Rosenbaum. Fly... climb... Do your work and find that boy. Rosenbaum? It's a To Do-list, Ayanda! Search lion parks and zoos. Check last week's bookings at every skydiving company in the region... Yes, also paragliding! Anywhere you can fly. Call me when you have something! Welcome, poetry lovers! At tonight's final! As will many have heard instead of John Gerber please welcome our local talent Dennis, competing at the final. Rob? You need to take your pill. Okay buddy, let's make a deal. You take your pill... and I'll let you shave my head. Seriously. Okay. Let's go for it. Rough day, huh? I'm ehh... I'm not here to ask you where Robin is. All I'm asking is. How can I hold this in my hand if he's still alive? I need to perform. Yeah, I know you do. It's written on the list and hasn't been checked off yet. Please. I can't do anything about that now! I'm under strict orders. You screwed that up all on your own. Where's the other half? Excuse me. Ayanda? We found his booking. Cape of Good Hope Skydiving. Yes, last week! So this is the part you're gonna connect to your father. Now... eh... when you're up there try not to wiggle. Oh and remember to pull your head backwards before you jump. All you alright, boy? Oh... eh... yeah. Yeah. Just a little nervous. When last were you at the DZ? Huh? The drop zone? When was your last jump, bro? Oh! The "drop zone"... Three weeks ago. Bro. How're you guys feeling? Like crap, thanks for asking. We're great. This is a lot of money for one jump, bro. Just take it. You want a video of the jump? No. No video. Find what? What have you found? And eh.. basketball? With your wife? I may be wrong but I don't think she's gonna like that. Miriam needs to understand that... What Miriam needs is for you to tell us where Robin is. John, you.. You took away her only son! Because you wanted to take him on some nice little adventure while she was fighting for his life! And she's still fighting! At least she deserves to know the truth. Clouds... fear of gravity. Sounds like your boy was obsessed with flying. What happened at the skydive, John? You tell me in rhymes if you want. Hello? Police! Hey. What's up, guys? How can I help? Hey! We're looking for my son Robin. He was here last week, with his father. John Gerber? Yeah... ehhh. You know where he is? No. I'm sorry. Thanks, officer. I'll take it from here. What's your name? My colleague is talking with the pilot right now! And I don't think he's gonna cover for you. So if you confess, I might be able to knock some time off your sentence. Take me to the slam. Life is not a wish list, John! I can't get you there. Last chance! You guys ready to fly? Thirty seconds! Ten. Ready to fly? Wait! The pilot says they both jumped but never brought back their parachutes! And he says, he doesn't even know where they landed. Rosenbaum? Pilot doesn't even know where they landed. Showtime. Open the cell door again. Sir? I said open the cell door again. Okay folks! Now let's hear it for our local talent. Dennis! Come on! Miriam needs to hear this. You give me the rest of the story. I promise she will. Ready to fly? Wait! Wait! What? I have an idea for mom's poem! What a surprise everybody! John Gerber! Did you break out, bad boy? Huh? Ehm, so... tell us. Did you have time to prepare at all or. Were you too busy knotting bedsheets together? I hope you're listening. What? It's an African saying. Turn your face towards the sun and your shadows will fall behind you. This one's from Robin. "For mom." The king of clouds. This king is scared of gravity. He has four legs. And claws? Twenty. And with his wings, he has a pair, the lion flies high up in the air. And the journey makes him worry. But he has goals and no regrets. He knows this keeps him safe from threats. He looks not down, not back but ahead. The fear of gravity has left and fled. So... uhm. Now I'd like to read one of my own. Police! Police! Stay seated please! Everybody be calm. Stay in your seats please! Everything's fine. Get him off that stage! I said trust me! You're done. A chase study: Newton says a stone falls down with the same speed, every time. Einstein says if you fall with enough speed, time slows down. So if you fall fast enough, do you float? Do you fly? If you fall like that and alike that fall every moment spands a lifetime never ending. Neverland. The kingdom of clouds. Your lion heart's racing your lion's blood pacing vains laced with adrenalin gone as the pain within and you hear the cadence click clack You're weightless, wingless, fearless, tearless. Each day a dream, each beat a win. To fight the venom, adrenaline's your medicine. Beneath you land and sea seconds of eternity. Free from freefall not falling, flying. Robin! You soar over a coast of hope. Over beach sands and dreamlands in your hands a list full of colossal demands. But that's not ballast. Doesn't pull you down. Because you're a legend. The king of the clouds. Maybe I was wrong trying to free you. Maybe I'm not strong maybe no hero. It's a thin line of course. There's no guarantee. But day after day my actions are judged by the toughest of courts me. The gavel it falls day after day and you fall and you fly time after time. Tick after tock my heart beats on. Not the only one who'll always love you, son. We're calling of the search. We've done the whole coast area. He's long gone by now. I'm sorry. Is this the phantom sketch? Yes. From the pilot? Yes, Sir. Color of hair? Blonde. Robin didn't have any hair because of the chemo. The pills. Now we can't find his body. Why? Why is the pilot lying to us? How come the nurse doesn't remember a bald-headed boy? How come John's been leading us to all those places? Everywhere except to Robin! How can I have this list in my hand which should be out there at the bottom of the ocean with Robin. According to John's last text. It's a story. It's all a story! Can you live with the idea of our son never leaving that room again? No. I could not live with that. Robin? The legend of the king of the clouds! So are you saying he's not here? Oh he's here in a way. "Find hope." That's what it says. Why would he do that? Make all of this up? His wife told me that poems were John's world. But they're her world, too. Does that mean he made this whole legend up for the sake of Miriam? For her. For himself. For Robin. Hope is a keeper. It keeps us alive. Hope is the name for trust in a life. Where a spark becomes a flame, becomes a fire. Where the course, the tune the path you choose, will never ever not come true. Treat the days of your life like lions their prize. If you fall don't just rise up but fly. Beyond hope. Beyond the coast. Beyond the dreams. Your list is a commitment to this life. And as long as there's an open box not me nor you nor she are gonna stop. 'Cause nothing nothing on this great earth is stronger than true love. And so we play on one beat at a time. No dream in vain no wrong no right. This is your game. Your legend. Your life.
