-No ice. -Here you go. Thanks. -Enjoy. -Have a good day. Hi, what’s going on? I’m down by the square. I’ll be on the right just past the bus stop. Okay. See you there. Hey, Fatih! -How're you doing? -Good. You? -Good. Did you lose some weight? -A bit, I guess. Is the wife not feeding you? -You go in front. -I’m okay in the back. No, you need to give directions. -Hi, Cengiz. -Hi Fatih. -How are you? -Good thanks, Fatih. You? Not bad. We take a left here if we can in this traffic. -You mean right across there? -Exactly. Okay, no problem. -Careful. It’s kind of crazy here. -Not a problem. I’ll take it slowly. If this guy lets us go, we can get across. -Now we go straight. -Okay. I’ve been to your place often enough, but I’d never find it on my own. Not surprising. The place is a building site. There’s no planning. -I keep going, Fatih? -Yes, keep going straight. Wasn’t there a big mosque here? I don’t see it. Next to a gas station, remember? Right, that’s around the back. We’re taking a shortcut. -So, how are the guys back in London? -Same as ever. -Slaving away to save up money. -Come on! There’s real life there. -Have you given up in two years? -We turn off here. -Here? Okay. -Yes. -Say again? -Two years and you’ve given up? Not exactly. But things are different in London. Argh, we should’ve turned off here. -Here? -Yes. -Sorry. -No problem. I’ll handle it. Careful. -I turn off here? -Exactly. Just think, if they reconstruct the building the owners would get two flats each. -True. -It’s a fact. True, but it’s not that simple. Still, look into it. I doubt they’ll say yes, but I’ll try. If they’re your friends, you can persuade them. Let’s get in there before the Syrians. -I’ll try. -Goodbye, Ahmet. -Welcome, Ayhan. -Thanks, Muhittin. -My brother, Cengiz. -Welcome, Cengiz. -Thanks. -It’s good of you to come. Well? First let’s have some tea here. -Or we can have our tea upstairs. -Yes, Dad. Let’s do that. Right, let’s go upstairs. Follow me. We’ll go this way and you can see our shop. FRACTURED -The pack of 15 works out cheaper. -No, this is fine. Add two of these to the bill. Here, son. Give one to your brother. This way, boys. That’s Hacer, Cafer’s wife. -Welcome. -Hello. Thanks. -Thanks. -Welcome. Fatih, get them a cold drink each. Forget it, Muhittin. We’ll have tea upstairs. You can have tea as well. They’re just being polite. Go ahead, son. -Have the prices gone up again? -No, they’re the same as last year. So Ayhan. How are your parents? They’re fine. In good shape. They spend summers back in the village. It’s cooler there. Good. We provide on-the-doorstep service and still she moans about prices. She’s always shopping at supermarkets, then comparing prices with ours. But their costs are nothing like ours! Yeah. She only uses us for emergencies. -Here, Dad. -Not for me. The whole neighborhood’s the same. Why did we ever get into this business? Don’t let them get to you, Muhittin. That’s all well and good, but Hacer knows this, too. We’ve been losing money every month since opening, believe me. -Dad, shall we go up? -Okay, let’s do that. -You can drink it on the way. -It’s okay. Thanks. -Thanks. -Let’s use the back way. Hacer, tell Cafer to be around this afternoon. -We’ll fix your bathroom. -Okay, sure. -Have a good day. -Thanks. -Cengiz, what do you do? -I'm a teacher. You have it easy then with the state behind you! Not as easy as you think. It’s a hard job in many ways. Every job is, but there’s hard and there’s hard. You get paid every month come what may. -Welcome! Come in. -Hello. Thanks, Şükran. Let me get you some slippers. Ah! Is that Selim? -Say welcome to our guests. -Selim? Don’t you recognize uncle Ayhan? How would he? He was a baby last time I saw him. -My brother, Cengiz. -Hello. -Welcome. -Here, it’s for you. -You shouldn’t have! -We couldn't come empty-handed. -Come in, don’t stand there. -This way. -Fatih, come in, son. -Okay. Go through. Come on through, boys. Cengiz, take a seat there. Come on, Ayhan. -Welcome once again, Ayhan. -Thanks, Muhittin. -Welcome, both of you. -Thanks, Fatih. -Welcome, Cengiz. -Thanks. Praise God. Fatih, bring the fan out here and switch it on. Okay, Dad. Sorry about this. Watch out. So, Ayhan. You said your parents were in the village. I hope they’re well. They are, but old age is setting in. They’re a lot slower these days. That’s normal at this age. -But you’re still in great shape. -No, I’m wearing out fast. Fatih, press that button on top so the fan moves around. Okay, Dad. That’s how it is, Cengiz. Diabetes is a curse on your health. It may not kill you, but it makes life hell. -Sorry to hear it. -I’m lucky to have reached this age. Şeyma, the cake’s done. There’s enough for tonight, too. I’m off to say my afternoon prayers. You make the tea. Okay, Mother. -Cover up those gold bracelets. -Okay. Şeyma, let me do it. -Welcome, Ayhan. -Thanks, Şeyma. Here you go, Ayhan. Thanks. Şeyma, I so wanted to be at your wedding but I was in London at the time. I know, Fatih said. -I hope you’re happy together. -Thanks. Here, Şeyma. -Do you live here, too, Fatih? -No, downstairs. Why would he live here with us old folk? We set up a new flat for the newly-weds. You should see it. Sure, Muhittin. If he’ll show us. I also want to see how he’s furnished it. Sure, I’ll give you a tour. Fatih was really into décor during his time in London. -Really? -No, it was just a passing thing. You should’ve seen him, Cengiz. He used to go to the malls and you know they have those small display rooms? He spent all his time off in them. Come on, you’re exaggerating. No, I am not. You said if you got a place one day you’d do an open plan kitchen. An all-in-one kitchen/living room. All in one? For God’s sake, how ridiculous! Imagine making your guests sit in a room full of cooking smells! Above all, it’s disrespectful to the guests. An open plan kitchen wouldn’t work in our flat anyway. Hello? Besir. Oh, shoot. Ayhan, I’d understand if you were short of space or money. Those infidels must’ve invented them. Their homes are so tiny. Hello Besir. Besir. Yes, I can hear you now. But that’s crazy, Besir. How can you put off the funeral for that long? I don’t get it. Doesn’t the man know? How is business in London? To be honest, not that great, Fatih. You know, with the Brexit thing, everyone’s nervous. -And that affects the general market. -Right. I follow it on the news. What do you think? Is leaving good for the UK? I think in the long term, yes. Most of my friends would agree. But short term, it’ll be a rough ride that’s for sure. Let me know if you hear anything. Okay, God bless. -So, don’t you miss the place at all? -What, London? Sure he does! He tries to hide it, but I can tell he does. Sure, you miss some things. but I’ve adjusted to being back. For one thing, it’s human nature to adjust. But I sometimes wonder if I was right to bring Fatih back from London. He didn’t want to come. I pressured him a bit. Okay, but isn’t it nice to be together as a family now? That was my thinking. I wanted him married here, not wasting his life with infidels, but... -Dad, let’s not get into that. -I know what we will and won’t get into. Anyway, Ayhan is no stranger. Sure, Muhittin. I’m one of the family. Bless you. My point is, Ayhan our eggs weren’t all in one basket when Fatih was in London. As you know, a little there goes a long way here. Fatih helped us out in London, but things are different now. Believe me, with such a big family doing so many jobs, we still struggle to get by. We’re still alive and grateful for it of course. In fact, Fatih and I were talking about you the other day. If Fatih had to go back to London... Dad, we talked about that. Not that it’s sure to happen, but if a suitable job came up. Fatih could discuss it with his wife. They might agree to it. Just think, Cengiz. Fatih has permanent residency in London. Plenty of people would pay a fortune for that, right? True. -What do you say, Ayhan? -We could look into it. I don’t mean anything long-term. Something for a few years that would secure their future. Until he’s made enough to open a café or restaurant here. Otherwise, nothing will ever change for us here. You haven't drunk your tea. Come on, don’t let it get cold. Cengiz? You haven't said a word. Not that I blame you. Our kind of talk is beneath an educated man like you. -Not at all. I’m listening. -He never says much. Listening is all well and good, but when I’m left to do all the talking, I wonder if I’m boring you. Look. See that, Ayhan? You all have baklava and I don’t. -Have some of this. -Dad, have some of mine. Şeyma deliberately left him out, Ayhan. She could at least have given me a taste. -But Dad, it’s bad for your diabetes. -It’s just one piece of baklava. We’d have got something else, if we’d known. No, far from it. Thank you! I miss having baklava. Come on, eat up. Muhittin. You’ve given us a great welcome with your hospitality. I hope we can return the favor at my parents. God willing. Muhittin. As you know, Fatih and I were like brothers in London. You did a great job raising him. So, you know the reason for our visit. Sure, it’s not just about that. We’ve got to see you, too. Yes. Fatih wasn’t actually that keen but we especially wanted to talk things over face to face. Well, it’s news to us. Fatih had to tell us because you were coming. We might never have known otherwise. You did my son a great favor. No one does anyone favors nowadays. -Bless you for that. -Thanks. When Fatih said how much interest you’d be paying the bank, I couldn’t let it happen. Of course, I had the money then. I couldn’t not help out a brother. -Thanks, Ayhan. -Thank you. You’re not eating or drinking a thing. Try my wife’s cake. It’s the best. -We already have. Thanks. -Good. -Fatih, how are the minibuses? -Fine, no problem. We have them working as school buses. Although they’re idle for a few months when the schools close for summer. But I can’t deny they help the family finances. Good, I’m glad. To be honest, Muhittin, I wasn’t sure about the minibus thing at first. -I told Fatih my reservations, right? -You did. But if it works, I’m glad to have helped. Thanks. That’s not quite true, but you can think of it that way. I’m confused. What exactly do you mean? It’s a family matter, Ayhan. You did my son a big favor, that’s true. Fatih, didn’t... Muhittin, sorry. I need to get this clear. Didn’t you send the money to buy the minibuses? No, no one ever said that. Look, this debt is my son’s. With God’s help we’ll stand by him as a family. God sees and knows everything so you have nothing to worry about. I’m not worried, Muhittin. I trust Fatih completely. Or why would I lend him that much money? -You shouldn’t feel uneasy about it. -I don’t, Fatih. But you should know that if I didn’t need the money I wouldn’t be here asking for it. I know. All I wanted was to help you and your family. Thanks Ayhan. You helped me a lot in London. I won’t deny it. Now please don’t get me wrong. Okay, you did me a big favor. Agreed. But you also used my bank accounts all that time. That’s no small deal. -Wait, he used your bank accounts? Why? -It doesn’t matter, Dad. It doesn’t matter if someone uses your account? Forgive me, Muhittin, but why are you reacting this way? Ayhan, if I’d known how that money was earned... Whatever. What’s done is done. Sorry, Muhittin, but how does Ayhan earn his money? Gambling money is no good to anyone, Cengiz. It’s also forbidden in our faith. -Gambling money? -Is that what Fatih told you? Fatih, did you say I made my money from gambling? No, I didn’t. I just said you made it from the stock market. For goodness sake, Muhittin! Do you really think of the stock market as gambling? Ayhan, if you make money from money, that’s gambling in my book. Okay... Well... I don’t know. Was I wrong to lend you the money? No one’s saying that. You helped my son, that’s a fact. -Give Şeyma a shout for more tea. -Not for me, thanks. -Ayhan, you? -No, thanks. Look, boys. Forgive me if I’ve said the wrong thing. -I thought you’d want me to be open. -No, no problem. Believe me. Well, what shall we do then? How about a tour of Fatih’s flat? -Sure, why not? -Come on, let’s go then. Şeyma, they want to see your flat. Go ahead and tidy up. It is tidy. Do they have to? I bet it was Fatih’s idea. Come on, it’s rude not to go with them. Şeyma! Can you come here? Why ask strangers into our flat? They want to see it. Quick, they’re waiting. -Some guests! -Enough of that, come on. Okay, you go. I’m coming. -Come on, son. We’re waiting. -I’m here, Dad. -Okay, this way. -Fatih, we don’t want to impose. -Let’s come another time. -You aren’t imposing. Come on. Cengiz, while you boys are looking around downstairs I’ll keep myself busy on the roof. See that bit of land in the corner? -The marsh there? -Right. That’s what all those tower blocks are built on. If it carries on like this, we’ll have no view left soon. -This side is more open. -Yes. It looks onto the neighborhood. I just hope we aren’t blocked on this side, too. -A lot of illegal building goes on. -Illegal? So report it. Sure, but think of it this way. The area has developed and gone up in value. Building permits allow three floors. That’s no use. Look, there are buildings everywhere. -Do you like it? -They only saw the living room. Nice. Enjoy living here. That’s the bathroom. And here’s the kitchen I mentioned. -It looks great, Fatih. -Yes, it’s not bad. That’s our bedroom. It has an en-suite bathroom. -And here’s the nursery. -Nursery? I’m going to be a dad soon, God willing. -Great news, Fatih! Congratulations! -Thanks. -Şeyma, congratulations. -Thanks, Ayhan. It’s very new. -God willing it’ll be your turn soon. -Exactly. No, we’re both hopeless cases. But I’m really pleased for you. -My congratulations. -Meanwhile... I was wondering how to give you your wedding gift. But this helps. -You shouldn’t have. -You really didn’t need to, Ayhan. Of course I did! Besides, I didn’t get to your wedding. May the baby be a blessing to his parents and country! Agreed. May the baby grow up happy and healthy. Come over, boys. -You don't have to stop. -No, I’ll carry on later. In any case, I’m both master and apprentice. So you do all this by yourself? -Dad does it, but we help out. -Don’t you believe it! They help once in a blue moon if something heavy needs carrying up. And that’s only reluctantly. -Ayhan, can I ask you boys a favor? -Sure, go ahead. Cengiz, see that tank? It needs mounting. Many hands will make light work of it. Okay. Sure. Great. Let’s go inside then. First, let’s get the tap on. For goodness sake! Right. Let’s do it, boys. Here goes. One, two, three, lift! Watch your hands here. Turn, Cengiz. One second. Careful of the step. Let’s get it on there and take a breather. -Careful. To the right a bit. -Wait. Get around the back, boys. God... -Let it rest there. -Watch out. You two go around the back. Cengiz, let’s pull it forward. Pull! Lift... Okay. -Is it properly in place? -Yes. The tap’s here. The front’s falling off. Wait. We need to lift again. -Dad, shall I come around? -No. Lift from the back and pull. -Okay, lift. -Lift after three. -One, two, three, lift! -Careful! -Okay. -It’s in place here. -Wait. -Okay? -Wait. -The right-hand side isn’t in place. -Shall I come around? -Let me get my breath back. Leave it there a minute. Dad, are you okay? Yes. -Okay, that’ll do for now. -No, it’s not stable. -Get to the back again. -Okay. Ayhan, you join him. -We need to lift again. -Let’s do it. One, two, three, lift! Watch the table. Watch your hand. A bit further. -Dad, are you okay? -Yes, son. Fine. So, you do all this as well, huh? Needs must, Ayhan. I’ve married Fatih and the oldest boy, I’ve given them homes. Now my only worry is the youngest. If I make him a homeowner, too, my job will be done. -Let’s hope so. -Yes. Whenever any money comes in, I get on with the building. Ayhan, we’re running late. Time to go? Wait, where are you going? Today’s our grill day. We ordered the butcher’s best meat. Stay and let’s eat together. No, but thanks. Another time hopefully. Anything else to say to Muhittin? Well, we’ve told him why we came. Muhittin, my brother tends to be shy, but he’s really in a squeeze. If Fatih can at least give a date for the payment we can plan accordingly. Let’s see. If worse comes to worst, I’ll apply for a bank loan. Ayhan, as you know, it’s no small amount. This is tough for us. But don’t you worry. We’ll pay back every penny we owe. I’m around for another week. I came back just for this. Okay, we’ll do what we can. I mean, Fatih will pay you whatever he gets together. -Here you go, Ayhan. -Thanks. Goodbye now. See you. Fatih. Yes, Ayhan? Look, please. Put some pressure on your family. -It’s not something a loan can fix. -Okay, I get it. If you remember, you said you’d sell your wedding gold and pay me part of the proceeds. Give me some time and I’ll handle it. Fatih, I still have a question. I didn’t push it with your dad there. Did you send your family the money to buy the minibuses or not? -Yes, I did. -But your dad says differently. Don’t worry, I’ll get back to you as soon as I can. -Take care now. -Fatih! Remember that piece of paper we signed between us just in case? Yes. I asked a lawyer friend about it and he said that piece of paper is legally binding. I see. What exactly does he do? Works for Starbucks like he did in London. As head barista, I think. Some crap loan he’ll get on that pay! And we’re giving them gold. Come here, Mom. Come on. One, two, three, there we go. The woman’s wet through with sweat and you have her in a cardigan! Pull. Here. You knew about the debt, didn’t you? -No, not at first. I found out later. -What does that mean? He asked for my wedding gold. I didn’t give it to him. Move aside. Let me do it. I’ll take her. Tell Fatih to come and see me. He’s gone to find out about loans. Good luck to him. Here we go, Granny. Open wide. Open. Şeyma... That care money is paid into your account every month, right? Yes, but sometimes it’s late coming. So there must be money left over in the account. No, father. I wish. We barely get by on Fatih’s wages. -How’s it going? -Okay. I see you got the salad stuff. Anything missing? Only tomatoes. -The tomatoes these days are uneatable. -I’ve enough in my fridge for salad. -Hacer, anything I can help with? -No, I’m almost done. Or pour us some tea. I just made it. Cafer, don’t disappear. The bathroom needs fixing. I know. I’m only calling in on Metin. -Mother? -Thanks. Put it down there. -You changed the shelves around. -Yes, they’re better this way. -Hacer, there’s some left in the bottom. -Just leave it, Mother. Şeyma, too bad about Fatih. How could he do that? No idea. He must’ve thought he could handle it in London. It’s terrible. What are you planning to do? -About what? -The money. We’ll sit down as a family tonight and work it out. -Okay, but... -There are no buts, Hacer. Everyone will do their bit. -Hacer, let me pay for this stuff. -Don’t bother. No, it’s for our place. Here. -That was there before, Muhittin. -I know. I was thinking a plunger might fix it. I wouldn’t bother, Muhittin. Why go to the extra expense? -We’ll fix it later. -Sure. -Salaam alaikum. -Alaikum salaam. Halil, here’s the minibus insurance. -Okay, I’ll put it in with the license. -Sure. -No problems, are there, Dad? -No, son. Put this in your pocket. -You pay it in every day, don’t you? -Yes, Dad. Good. We’ll be landed with that debt, I’m telling you. Fine, keep switching channels! Your dad is fine with Hacer’s shop and questions me over the care money. But that would be an excuse for you to go back to London. -When our baby arrives... -Şeyma, for God’s sake! Call Mahmut and ask him about loans. If your dad asks, you’ll have an answer. I know enough about loans, don’t worry. Fine. If you know that much, you could go get a loan! -Come in, Mother. -Şeyma. Turns out we had some. Use these, too. -Okay. I already started on the salad. -Good girl. I’ll check on Muhittin, then I'll come and help. Here you are. Şükran, give Zarife a call and see if there’s room in the car. We were like sardines last time. But 10 hours on a bus would be rough on us both. Let’s decide when we know the date of the funeral. Muhittin. I don’t feel good about this. Tell your lying son, not me. Okay, Fatih made a mistake, but isn’t the debt all of ours? Did anyone say it was only Fatih’s? Then tell me what you have in mind. First let Fatih find out about loans. -Will they lend Fatih that much? -Every little helps. Şükran, give Turan a shout. I need his help. He’s just got in. Let him rest a bit. Fine. I’ll kill myself here while the boys rest. Great! Come on. Turan, son. Turn that down. It’s doing my head in. -What’s up? -Your dad wants help with plastering. -Plastering what? -He’s an old man. Go and help. -It won’t take long. -Yeah, right! I’ve heard that before. It’s your idea, isn’t it? Dad didn’t send for me. He did. I told you so. Do as you like. Why do I bother getting involved? Turan, when you finish that wall, we’ll redo the facing one while we’re about it. Dad, it’s going to keep leaking there. I’m fixing it for good, don't worry. Dad, how about I come with you to the village? You mean it’s an excuse for an outing. No! She’s family. And family should be at funeral. Empty that tub for me. Get a move on, Turan. The other wall still needs painting. What are you doing? Empty it outside. Hacer, we’re having a grill. What’s with the fancy mezze? If I don’t do my share, Şeyma will mouth off. And who does the grilling here while the other men take it easy? That’s different. Cafer! Have you discussed the Fatih thing? No we haven't. Where is Selim? Upstairs. He’s forgotten the way home thanks to you. Hacer! I can’t even ask you a simple question. Muhittin. I want to say something, but don’t get angry. If you know I’ll get angry, don’t! Suppose we sell the land in the village? Give that here. I can wash myself. I’m going back to the village with or without you as soon as I sort out those boys. When all the family is here? We’d be as good as childless there. Sell the land in the village, and let the family cemetery go to rack and ruin. Huh? Those boys did us a favor and now they’re in trouble. No, they’re not. They just say that to get all the money back. They got a duplex flat here last year. As if we don’t know. Careful not to spill it. Okay, Selim? Here you go. Alright. Is Hacer around? No, but she’ll be here tonight with her famous mezze to make up to us. -The shop should still be open. -It’s been known to be closed all day. Shall I add the tomatoes, Mom? -Let it boil a bit longer. -Okay. No, it’s better if he puts the bill in his name. Mom, don’t push me at Grandpa’s. I’ll eat and I’m out. Move! As if you have a gun to your head! Okay, we’ll talk about it tomorrow. See you at the shop. Why not turn around here, Yusuf? Don’t bother coming in! -Welcome! -Thanks. -Come in. Everyone’s here. -Welcome! Thanks, Mom. -Yusuf! When did you get back? -Yesterday, Gran. It was hell getting him to come. But don’t get me started! -Why? -It’s not true! Kiss your gran’s hand. -Welcome. -Thanks. -Come in. -Let me put this somewhere. Come in, dear. -Welcome, Harun. Good to see you. -Thanks. -Come on in. -Hello! -How are you doing? -Great. You? Hey! Where is my beautiful girl? -How’s university? -Fine. I’m studying away. -Good. -Father. -Let me kiss your hand. -Don't bother. Dad, let him. He won’t let you down again. Harun, kiss his hand. Muhittin, there’s no place in this family for bad blood. My turn now, Dad. Sit down here, Fatma. And Yusuf, you come next to me. -Hacer. Where’s Cafer? -Upstairs, manning the grill. I’ll go and say hello then. Hey, Harun! I never thought I’d see you here! Had to, or your sister would kick me out. Good for you. I’m not sure about that. We’ll see. Here, have a seat. You have a great setup here. And your own private stash. It’s the only way to get through the night. How's business? Good. Students like the place. -May it go from strength to strength. -Thanks. -These are done. -They look good. -Want a taste? -Sure. -It’s really hot. -Sure is. Careful. -Delicious. Very tasty. -Good and tender. What’s Fatih been up to? -Your guy screwed up big time. -Why "my guy"? You like each other. -So what happens now? -With what? With Fatih. Lord London will have to pay for the good time he’s been having. What’s with the "Lord London"? -He’s a lord, right? Lord Fatih. -Lord Fatih. The onions are burning. Take them off. -Look. The screen’s locked, okay? -Okay. Now watch carefully. -See that? -Whoa! Will it work if I try? Give it a go. It doesn’t work with me. Do it again. -Turn on the light. See? -Okay! It recognizes you. Sure, it unlocks the second it sees any part of my face. The guys are geniuses. Can you get it cheaper in the US? -I guess. -Come on, guys. -The meat’s getting cold. -We’re coming. I’m on my way. -How are you doing, Casanova? -Get out of here, Harun! Didn't you promise to marry the girl to bed her? You were so quiet around my dad. Didn’t take you long to bounce back. -Cem, wait a second. -What’s up? I hear you fired my cousin and gave his job to a Syrian. It’s all down to costs. We had to fire all the new kids. I gave him some contacts, though. Didn’t he say? -No, he did. -Okay, good. Let’s go in. -No, wait. -Why? Have you heard about Fatih? You mean the money thing. Gülnaz mentioned it. You know how things are between me and Muhittin. If the inheritance comes up tonight, don’t take a back seat. -Make our presence felt. -Harun, you never learn, do you? -You forget what happened last time. -So, we just go with it? We’ve lost this place, and now the village land? This family will never leave anything to the girls. Wise up! We’ll see. There’s always a way. -So, you’re out for blood. -No, there are laws about this. Hey! Watch out. Pass it to me. Enough running around, kids! Arya, didn’t you hear? Come and eat, come on. Selim! -Dad, shall I dish you up a plate? -You’ve got us into this plate habit. -We won’t all fit around the table. -No, I’ll come over. Okay, men to the table. Muhittin, come on. -Cafer, dish me up a plate. -Okay. -Come on, guys. Don’t let it get cold. -It looks amazing. -It’s no big deal. -No, you do wonders on that grill. Dad, I’m giving you a bit of everything. -Turan, how’s this one? -Great. Try that, too. -Vine leaves? -Yes. -Onion salad? -Just a tiny bit. -Yusuf, go and help yourself -Okay. -I’ll do it for him. -It’s okay, Uncle. -But I’ve waited for you so long, doctor! -I’ll do it. -It hurts here, doctor. -That’s from being idle. -That’s unfair when I just served you! -It’s true. -What’s my problem, doc? -Ask me in six years when I qualify. -I’ll be dead by then! -Only the good die young. Keep out of this! Fatih, what’s the problem? Aren’t I family? That’s not the issue. -Uncle, that’s enough. -No, it’s not! You are a student. A student must eat when he can. -And stay out of trouble. -Exactly. -That’s enough, Uncle. Please! -Okay. Just some vine leaves. There you go. Doctor, don’t stand there. Have a seat here. Do us the honour. Don’t say that. You were going to show me that photo. Wait, we went someplace else as well. I took pictures there, too. Wait a second. Şeyma, when you’ve eaten, do a plate for Mom. Come on, as if I’ve ever not fed her. I’ll do it in a minute. Good girl! Your turn now, Selim. See? The meat is sliced paper-thin. But they do thicker ones, too. Look. And that’s the griddle plate. It’s big, though. Ours will be smaller. -Looks like a doner kebab. -No, a cağ kebab is totally different. I’ll go and make us some tea. First, it’s made with goat meat. You marinate it, thread it onto skewers cook it over a wood fire and serve it in flatbread. -Have you had enough, buddy? -For now. I’ll get some more in a bit. -Okay then. -Cafer, you haven't eaten a thing. -Never mind me. I’m happy watching. -Selim! -That’s Cafer. A professional victim. -What? I’m just saying you probably ate upstairs. Okay, I had a taste, I won’t lie. Stop that child crying. You look like you’re done eating. Off you go now and play. Give me the plates. You see to the baby. Hey, what’s up? Are you hungry? Okay, come on. Let’s go. Oh, sweetheart. Fener’s playing so badly this year. I only went because of my season ticket. Remember, Cem? Fatma, can you give me more meat? -Sure. You want salad? -No, thanks. -Go on, give him some. -No, it gives me gas. -I told you that forward was no good. -It’s not just him, it’s the whole team. Right. They should all be fired. I’ve lost all my bets this year. -You bet on Fener when they’re like this? -Zip it, you sick Galatasaray fan. -There’s a bad egg in every family. -Cem, come with me a minute. Fatih, why were you so quiet about Fener? It’s obvious, they suck. Fatma, leave that to me. -No, I’ve got it. -No, leave it to me. Okay, go on then. He’s really a gynaecologist, you know. But I call whenever the baby gets a fever. I know. He was great with us, too, but he’s kind of expensive. Okay, he charges more than the others, but we’re talking about health here. Fatih, I was telling Şeyma about Dr. Çağatay. Getting a good doctor really matters with a first baby. I know. We’ll figure something out. Ask around. If necessary we can help. After all, it’s my nephew or niece. Thanks. Okay, I’ll check it out. If I have any spare, I’ll chip in. If you find a few thousand, we’ll put that in I’ll add my share and we’ll sort it out. But it’s come at a bad time. I’m really hard up right now. Fatih, don’t be so down, son. I’ll bring up the subject inside. I just wish you’d told us before. -Dad knew actually. -No! -You mean your dad knew about the money? -Well, not exactly. When Dad found out Ayhan made his money on the stock market, he was against the idea. Son, if your dad was against it, why did you still go ahead? Look at the mess we’re in. Well, when you sent the money, didn’t your dad ask where you’d got it? I said it wasn’t from Ayhan and he left it at that. -Mom, we’re going. -Okay. I’ll be with you in a moment. Wait, let me fix that. -It’s okay, Mom. Hands off. -All right. I wasn’t going to eat you. Cem, thanks. It’s so kind of you. No problem. I’m only giving our doctor a ride. -Don’t be late back. Do you have money? -How would I, Mom? Talk properly to your mom. -Give us a call now and again. -I will, Uncle. -Bye then. -Don’t spend it all at once. -Yusuf, where are you off to? -To see friends, Gran. Gülnaz, let’s get home before the baby wakes up. -Fatma. -Gülnaz, see you soon. Goodbye. -Goodbye! -See you, sweetie. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Fatih, give me a hand, will you? Towards you? Okay. -Fatih, did you ask about loans? -Yes, Dad. -Who did you ask? Mahmut? -Yes. -What did he say? -Well. I can get three times my monthly salary. -Is that all? Why so little? -Don’t ask me. Wait, dear. Let me finish that. Didn’t he suggest anything else? We’d get more if we mortgaged the house. Smartass, Mahmut! He can mortgage his own dad’s house! Put that boy to bed. I don’t know, Harun. It's like I like her but... -She’s not a great match for our family. -Turan, this is about love. True, but I don’t know. Harun, put the table back and make more room here. Okay. Turan, you go that end. Look, Turan. She may be outgoing, but she’s not what you think she is. I know her brother. They’re a decent family. Let’s hope for the best. What can I say? Şeyma, the baklava Ayhan brought is on top of the fridge. Put it on a plate. Mom. -The machine’s full. These won’t go in. -Just rinse them. That’ll do. I already have. I’ll go on ahead with the tea. Fatih, we’re just adding one thing to the menu. It’s not like there’s any risk. All it means is getting a griddle plate. Mother, isn’t Fatma a pro on the griddle? Think of her flatbreads. And we’ll get the meat from the place I mentioned. -I hope it’s a success. -Me too, Mother. -Fatih, how come you’re not convinced? -No, I am, but... Look, I think students will go for cağ kebabs over hamburgers. -They’re Turkish after all. -I’m not so sure. Why not? Still, your place was pretty busy when I passed by the other day. Yes, business is good right now. Students like the place. -It’s great you put tables out. -The place is pint-sized. We had to. You’re lucky the council lets you. They don’t normally but we keep the police sweet. Hacer. -Find Cafer. He’s disappeared again. -He’ll be back. I expect he’s downstairs Fatih, are you saying students won’t go for cağ kebabs? Well. Father, have a seat here. Here, Harun. Have my seat. Thanks. Father, I ran into Ragıp the other day. He said hello. -Thanks. -I almost forgot to say. -What’s he up to these days? -Who, Ragıp? Same as ever, hanging out at the café. He was just back from the village. Mom, can you pass me the remote? -You’re planning to watch a soap? -No, but I might peek now and again. -Why do you never sit still? -Wonder who he gets that from?! Mom, why pour the tea all at once? It’s stone cold. Cafer, come and sit with all of us. -Cafer, there’s space here between us. -I’m fine. The chair’s good for my back -Muhittin, now all the men are here. -Şükran, that discussion is for just us. How can you say that, Dad? Don’t we count as family? Don’t talk nonsense, Fatma. This doesn’t concern you. Don’t take it personally. It doesn’t concern us either. -What does that mean, Cafer? -There’s nothing to discuss. You took on the loan without asking us, so you pay it back. -Cafer! -What, Mom? The guy lied to us all that time and still you stick up for him. Okay, I made a mistake, I agree. But what does it matter if the money was mine or borrowed? -They are not the same thing. -How come? For years you make us feel bad about your ‘favor’ and then say you borrowed the money. Great! You felt bad about it for years? Give me a break! -If I didn’t know you... -What was that? -He didn’t say anything. Now stop. -No, he likes having a dig. Cafer, I’m more upset with Fatih than any of you. Especially after today’s humiliation with those boys. But what can we do? The boys are right. -Sorry, but how much are we talking? -20 thousand pounds. -Really? -Yes. -How much is that in Turkish money? -Around 150 thousand lira. -150 thousand? -That’s a fortune! Fatih, didn’t you send us around 100 thousand? -Or am I getting it wrong? -No, but the pound’s gone up. -So we’re seriously out of pocket. -Nonsense! Shouldn’t we just pay back what they gave us, Muhittin? -No, they’ll want pounds if they paid... -Who’s asking you? I’m just saying what I think, father. Look at us, blindly paying interest! We haven't actually discussed that. He may agree to the old exchange rate. You think he will? Dad, why don’t I call Ayhan and ask? Go on, see what he says. But, Fatih... say something about me not being prepared to pay interest. Okay, Dad. Hello? Hi, Ayhan. Can you hear me? Sorry to disturb you. -My guess is Ayhan will say yes. -Let’s hope. He would if it was up to him, but there’s his moody brother, Cengiz. -He’s more difficult. -I think he’ll agree to it. -Give us more tea, dear. -Wait, I’ll do it. Fatma, your cağ kebab idea is fab. I’ll be at your place all the time. You’re always welcome. Cağ kebab? What’s that? -What’s going on, Harun? -You don’t have kids at college. You’ll see when Selim grows up. Okay if you were from Erzurum, but you aren’t. How does that work? -I don’t want any, Şeyma. -Too late. I’ve poured it. I need some air. Dad, our costs have gone up a lot. Harun can’t manage on his own. So, I’ll be doing the cağ kebabs, the flatbreads and so on. Fine, good luck to you. What can I say? And Turan, I know I give you a hard time but don’t feel pressure because I introduced you with the girl. -This is serious stuff. -No, I know. Don’t worry. Good, okay. Mom, I have a favor to ask. When you go to the village, can you get me some cheese? I’ll pay you when you get back. Never mind the money. We'll see. Turan, come here a second. -Yes, Dad? -Who are those boys there? -Which ones? -In front of the thing. -I know the guy on the phone. -The one out front? Yes. That’s Bahri’s son. He’s just back from the army. -Bahri the baker? -Yes. -Did you speak to Ayhan? -Uh... He agreed. Why the ‘uh’? Did he agree or not? He agreed to the old exchange rate, but only if we pay the whole lot in a week or 10 days. How much is ‘the whole lot’? He’s okay with 100 thousand lira. There’s no way we can find that kind of money right away. Selling both minibuses wouldn’t make that much. I was just making a point, Dad. I’d be the last person to sell them. How do we find the money without selling something? Dad, I know Ayhan well. I really think he needs the money. Maybe we can’t find the whole lot, but even if we pay him half, I think he’d accept it. Sure, if it’s true what you say. Nice idea, but how will we find even half the money? As none of us has the money, we’ve no choice but to sell something. -Sell what? -As the money went on the minibuses... I wondered when the minibuses would come up. -Turan. -Sorry, but you all have it made. -You have houses, you’re fine. -Just let me finish. -Turan, let him speak. -I realize you’ll have a wedding soon. -And you’re behind us with houses. -Speak for yourself. He’s not behind me. He can have the basement right now. -And I’d be spared your dirty water. -Cafer! We fixed that leak today. A repair job won’t fix it. His whole bathroom needs redoing. Okay, Cafer. I’ll get a builder in to do it sometime soon. Turan, you want the basement? I’ll move upstairs. But you know the shop goes with the basement. Dad, let’s at least sell one minibus. Turan can keep the other. Son, we can’t sell any minibuses now. We’d make a crippling loss. They’re contracted to be school buses. It’s impossible before the summer break. Anyway, you go on about the minibuses, but that money got you your house, too. Well said! Let’s get down to the facts here. Okay, I got my house, but the money helped us all in some way. No. It didn’t help us. Let’s get that straight. Stop dragging us into your debt. So, unemployment benefit paid for your shop? Sorry, Fatih, we didn’t use your money. Maybe not directly, but you used money made from the minibuses which counts as the same thing. You know everything, right? -We’re all idiots. Only you have brains. -Cafer! You’ve no shame left either. Look at you talking over everyone again. -Please! Don’t stir things up today. -It’s always me, is it? Cafer, quiet! Whenever I talk, I’m always told to shut up. The guy bangs on and on at us and I’m the one who’s told to shut up. Great! Thanks. Şeyma, take Mom to her room. Sure, it’s her bedtime anyway. I’ll go and check on Selim. Dad, for the love of God tell me something. If I did what he did, would you react the same? I know your history, don’t you worry. It’s about that digger again, isn’t it? Good thing I screwed up then. It’s given you an excuse. -Fatma, get me a glass of water. -Sure, Dad. You still go on about the digger. We almost lost everything thanks to you. You think Fatih went to London for fun? So Fatih went to London because of me? Thanks, Dad. Muhittin, don’t start this again. He went to Yalova for a job, remember? He always wanted out. Cafer, enough! If the digger had worked out, it would all be different. For God’s sake! So it was my fault the digger didn’t work? You knew, that’s why it was cheap. But you planned to fix it. -How did I know Harun’s guys were sharks? -Not this again! -Did they force you to buy it? -They said the starter motor was dodgy. In a month, the engine, gearbox, everything was dead. Yes or no? Okay, Cafer. Enough! Cafer, for God’s sake stop talking about the digger. It’s been years and we’re still getting over it. Thanks, Fatma. You were the only one in this family who didn’t put me down. What are you talking about? -That’s shameful. -It’s true. Keep talking. You talk. Harun, you too. Talk away. You all know Cafer. Why are you winding him up like this? No one did a thing, Mother. He’s winding himself up. Here. Here, take this. Cafer, stop giving yourself stress. Loosen up a bit. Look at Fatma. Just look at her. Forget the men, even she’s putting me down. -Sure, I’m the family scapegoat. -Okay, just let them go to hell. They all backed me at first, remember? And when things fell apart? Cafer, lie down here. Come on, lie down. Okay, let’s say we count me out. Take this away, dear. What about our forefathers’ graves? If they don’t mean anything, fine, let’s sell the land. No, Dad. No way. Who knows what’ll happen in Istanbul? Things are getting worse every day. An earthquake is waiting to happen. Everything points to the village. Harun and I were talking about it. Dad, if you’re okay with it, we want to build a house on that land. We could go there in summer. It would be a change of scene. Talk to Mahmut tomorrow and get the loan moving. I spoke to Cem. He can’t help right now but he will in two-three months. -Okay, Fatih? Get the loan moving. -Dad, I really don’t know what to say. We keep coming back to the loan. Dad, why should I go get a loan when the family’s sunk all that money? Fatih! Okay, if you can live with your conscience. -So, did you sign anything between you? -Harun, keep out of this. Actually, we signed a paper, nothing big. You signed a paper? You signed a paper with him and you’re only telling us now? Dad, what’s the problem if we’re going to pay him back? Ayhan hasn’t brought it up either. -How many more lies? -What’s it got to do with anything? Unless we’re not going to pay. No, that money has to be paid. Muhittin... I can only think of one thing. Why don’t we women give you our gold? Our gold? Yes. If I add mine, we’d have something worthwhile. I think that’s fair. You know I put all my gold into this building. But now you have double that. What are you talking about? You think I have gold? The whole neighborhood knows it. -Hacer, do you have gold? -How can I, Cafer? Shame on you, Şeyma. And now you bad-mouth us. -Cafer! -Cafer, I’m not bad-mouthing you. Hacer has gold, but she’s hiding it. Hacer, what’s she saying? -She’s lying. -Then swear on the Quran. -Keep the Quran out of it. -What on earth is this about? No, she should go ahead. Let’s see them eat dirt and maybe feel some shame. Can we just drop this? Anyway, Mom, it’s wrong to use gold saved for your funeral. Great! Let the mud stick. We’re black sheep anyway. You won’t get your way this time. Hacer, you swear on the Quran. And you Şeyma, put all your gold on the table. Okay, Şeyma? I’m not giving up my gold. My family gave me most of it. -Turan, get the Quran, but wash first. -Is it really necessary? -Cafer, enough! -Well, I’ve had enough, too. Turan, go get it. Go on, get it. It was you, Mother, wasn’t it? -What’s that supposed to mean, Hacer? -You told Şeyma. I wanted you to know in case anything happened to me. -And you went... -Hacer, stop! Are you hiding gold from me? Hacer! Huh, Hacer? -Hacer, I’m asking you a question. -Cafer! -Do you have gold? -Cafer, okay. Talk about it later. -Hacer, answer my question. -Cafer, calm down. It’s okay. Hacer, don’t make me crazy. Are you hiding gold from me? -Cafer, what are you doing? -Dad, keep out of this. Hacer! -Do you have gold or not? Hacer! -I put some aside for Selim. God damn you! -Why do I even bother with you people? -Cafer, you’ve gone too far. Thanks, Dad. But what else to expect if my wife does this? -Watch what you say to Dad. -Don’t tell me what to say, weasel. -Listen, Cafer... -The hell I’ll listen to you put me down! Watch your mouth. This isn’t some zoo. Hands off me! What kind of people are you? Stop! Have some respect or you’ll face me! -Fuck you, asshole! -Get him out of my sight. -Like I want to live under your roof! -You piece of scum! You’re no son of mine! Hacer, go after him. Don’t leave him on his own. -Go on, Hacer. He won’t hurt you. -Hacer, run! You saw how mad he was. Go on! Talk to him downstairs. Turan? -Is your lip bleeding? -It’s bleeding? Let me see. No, it’s okay, Mom. Don’t you know Cafer? Why wind him up? -So it’s my fault, is it? -No one’s saying that. Give me a break! You kick up a row and you’re still mouthing off. Turan! Enough, son. Someone must’ve put the evil eye on this family. I’d better do a lead-pouring in the morning to lift the curse. Mom, it’s time we were going. Yusuf will be home by himself. -We’ll come with you to the door. -No, there’s no need. -No, because we’ll head home, too. -Okay, fine. Good night, Fatma. If we don’t see Yusuf, wish him all the best. -Good night. -Thanks, Şeyma. Şeyma, I’ve left the pan I used for the vine leaves on the counter. -Okay, I’ll empty it. -I think Hacer already did. Okay, let me get it. Sorry to be a nuisance, but I don’t have another pan that size.
