--== McEphie ==-- [ominous music playing] [ominous music continues] [crickets chirping] [suspenseful music playing] [suspenseful music continues] Shoot, there's no signal! [ominous music playing] [car door closes] Oh, my goodness. Why is it so dark here? No government-lighting project? Babe, are my eyebrows on point? [ominous music playing] Yeah. So, guys, we're here. It's a bit creepy, like right out of a Halloween special. You're live? Yeah. How come I don't have a signal? I told you, babe. Change your phone already. You know what? To be honest, you have the same phone as our maid's. [chuckles] Mister, are you sure this is the place? Ma'am, this is your pinned destination. Uh, do you want me to take you back? Uh... Girls, let's go? [suspenseful music playing] [crickets chirping] Maybe it's a speakeasy. You mean "kill easy." We may easily be killed by ghosts here. Like, by a cult? -By a ghost, girl! -[car horn] Miss, your payment? Mister, we paid already. [no audio] [no audio] [no audio] Oh, my gosh. My stilettos got dirty. Arianne, they should have said in the invite to bring flip-flops or something. Ugh. Shoot. Babe, I don't mean to be a party pooper, but-- So, don't. Look at it, babe. This place is a bit sketchy. I mean, this place is super sketchy. Why here? Why not? This is an exclusive party. They want to be unique. And besides, would you really back out now that we've been through all these? Imagine the network we can build with all the mid and macro influencers here as guests. Think of how many followers and product sponsors we can get. Yup. Correct, babe. So, stop being negative. Let's do this. For the followers. Let's go. Babe, oh, my god. -What? -What's wrong? What? -What? -There's no signal. -Ugh. -Gosh. See? I told you. [Flo] Ugh. Shoot. [ominous music playing] [knocking on door] [door opening] There you go. [Dani] Hi! Whose guest list? Uh... Chloe's. Chloe... Go ahead. Where is it? Is this a joke? Invisible stamp. -Lots of gimmick. -Right here. Uhm, put mine on my forehead. Girl, why on the forehead? What are you thinking? It's invisible anyway, right? -Let's go. -Come on. Hold on, you need to surrender your phones. What?! Excuse me? Uhm, why? We are here to promote the party. For your information. Babes. Let's just comply. I think Chloe may have mentioned that there are foreigners and diplomats inside. They are VIPs so they want the party to be private. Uhm... But, babe, how are we supposed to do our job? How can we get more followers on social media if we don't have photos? Exactly. [man] We have an official photographer inside, ma'am. What's this? A graduation ceremony? Eew. And they'll provide copies, right? Okay. See? There you go. Let's go, we're late. [clicks tongue] Oh my... Okay. [door closing] [trance music playing] [trance music continues] Oh, my god. You know what, babe? I think I've seen this before. Is this the part where we get killed? [chuckles] What kind of aesthetics is that? Let them be. It's art. Art? Wow. Shoot. Arianne! [sobbing] [grunting] [gasping] [loud music playing] Let's go, babe! Oh, my gosh! Wait, wait, wait, guys. Hi, everyone! We're here in Z Compound. So, we're here because you guys requested that we do a pub crawl in a place we've never been before. That's why we're here! I'm excited! We can't wait. So, we don't know what we're gonna expect inside. So, let's go? Let's go! Come on! Come on! [Arianne's phone ringing] [ringing continues] Mom? Mom... Wait. [loud music playing] Hello. Mom? Hello. I'm sorry, Mom. Yes, I'm going to send you some money. Sorry. Will do. Babe! -Let's go! -Yes, I'm coming. My gosh. Let's go, babe! Let's go! -Let's party! -Babe, let's go! -What are you waiting for? -Let's go! [loud music playing] Okay, so as you can see, guys, the party is packed! And apparently, it's DJ's night tonight. Hence, the big party crowd and flowing drinks! [Flo] Exactly, yes! Let's go, let's go, let's go? Let's just have fun, and let's get this over with. [party music playing] Babe, cheers! Wait. Cheers! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hello! We follow you girls on social media. [Arianne] Oh, wow! Thank you. Okay, so guys, we have some newfound friends here. Say hi to the vlog. [All] Hello! One, two, three! [party music playing] Dani girl, is that you? You've lost weight! You look so different. I'm guessing you already have a love life now? Hi, guys! As you can see, there's Flo and Arianne behind me eating... What is that? Balut! (Duck embryo!) Babe! Yeah? Say hi! Hi! -What's that? -It's balut! Wait. Go ahead, you guys try it first. -Try it. -No, no. no. You go ahead. You should try it. Babe, I don't want to. Please, no. Okay, okay. No, no, no. Come on. -Babe! -Oh, my gosh. The hell! Babe, I said I don't want to. Stop it. Well then, let's go. I can't. I have to change, okay? Fine. They're irritating! [upbeat music playing] Hi, guys! Good evening. We're here right now in Cubao Expo. I'm still with Arianne and Dani, and we're about to enter Tacio's. We're about to drink and eat and have fun! We've got some free Sambuca shots to try. Let's do this! Wait. Where's Arianne? Uhm, I don't know. Oh... [chuckling] -Cheers! -Cheers! [Flo] Hi! [Dani] Babe, you've drunk too many shots. -Babe, I'm done. -[Dani] No. I'm feeling it. I'm feeling it! [Arianne] Damn. What the heck?! What do you think you're doing?! Bastard! -What the heck. -What's wrong with you?! [Dani] Arianne, no, no! Jesus Christ! What the hell is going on? This guy's an asshole! Pervert! -Damn you! -What did you do? Yes, you're a pervert! -Freaking pervert. -You're freaking drunk. Pervert! Pervert! What the hell is going on? It's been days since the incident happened. I wasn't planning on talking about it. Some people also advised me not to talk about it. But this is the first time I received such derogatory comments. That I am a slut, and I deserved to have my breasts groped just because I danced and I had fun. People thought I asked for it. But it seems that my bashers didn't like the fact that I wasn't complaining. So, they reported my account. From 30k followers, it dropped to 56. [sobs] What have I done to deserve this? To my 32 followers who are watching right now, thank you. I worked so hard to get the followers. This is my livelihood. Everything that I have now, it's because of my being an influencer. Companies believe in me. But how could they believe me now that I've lost my followers? [sniffling] [sniffs] [mail alert] [slow music playing] [phone chimes] [typing] [message sent alert] Hi, guys. How are you? As most of you know, I posted the viral video of our friend, Arianne, in Cubao Expo. It wasn't me who took the video. It was our friend, Dani. My only intention was to send a warning, especially to girls, that those types of perverts really do exist. But a lot of people misunderstood the video. Who is actually the victim here? But unfortunately, it spread all over the web. This is not just a hobby that we're doing. We are not just trying to look cute or what. This is our livelihood. This is our only income. Say, for example, my makeup right now. This is sponsored by Luminous Cosmetics. And my outfit is actually from BYS. Also my shoes and my... Babe, babe. -What? -It's Arianne. She's here. -So? -Here she comes. Hi, babe! "Hi, babe?" Bitch, stop using me and the incident to get more followers. Excuse me, what are you saying? From 8k followers, you're now at 15k. And yet you still don't want to stop? What's this? You're taking a video of yourself while pretending that you're actually concerned? For what? To get more interactions? More followers? Is that it? -Babe... -You're really a piece of work. Excuse me. Is it my fault that your social media account was reported? Yes, it's your fault! -Wow. Are you blaming me? -Babe! Yes, that's what I'm saying. -She's blaming me. -Guys, stop! [Dani] People are listening. [Flo] So? Stop fighting. We're best friends, right? Damn you! You're one to talk. You said you're going to delete the video. -But you gave it to her. -She said it's for awareness. Awareness, my ass. What are you saying? We're trying to help you. Damn you all. Babe! Babe. What? Enjoying your video recording? Stop it. You bitches. Damn you all! Video all you want! Oh, my gosh. [no audio] [intense music playing] Hi, guys! So, I'm gonna do a makeup tutorial today. We're gonna start with blush. Shoot. One more time. [clears throat] Hi, guys! Today, we're gonna do a makeup tutorial for that everyday look. First step, I'm gonna put some powder. Shit. [camera shutter clicking] [intense music playing] [intense music continues] [intense music continues] [no audio] [no audio] [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music continues] [phone chimes] [typing] [phone chiming] [no audio] [typing] [phone chimes] [phone chimes] [no audio] Sorry, babe. I'm really sorry. -Hi, babes! -Hey. Sorry, I'm late. I got stuck in traffic. Babe... What's that? What's that for? I just want to say sorry for the things I've done. I understand if you can't forgive me right now. Babe, that's nonsense. That's why we're here, right? So we can set things right. Babe, right? Hmm? Arianne... I'm really sorry, too. I should have thought about it before I uploaded the video and clicked share. I'm sorry. So, babe... Why don't you tell Flo about your plan on having a girls' night out? Oh, yeah. Uhm... Girls' night out? What's that? Well, I got invited to this exclusive party. It's for influencers like us and... Wait, I'll just show you guys. Here. This is the teaser. There. [upbeat music playing] [upbeat music continues] Actually, a lot of famous influencers are there. We're going to meet a lot of them. Now you want us to accompany you to a party that you call a girls' night out, but your real intention is to get more sponsors and followers? Look. You know that you two are the only friends I have. And I could have invited anyone else, but it would be more fun if I go with you two, right? And okay, fine... This is also like helping me get my followers back. But... You will benefit from this, too. You can build your network and gain followers, right? -Seriously? -If you're not up to it, babe... we can just drink and party. Yes, exactly! Come on, there's nothing else to it. It's gonna be fun. True. You know I love you, and as a Pisces, I know that you can't say no to me. Fine. Is that a yes? Yay! Okay, okay. So, uhm... We're just required to post pre-event stuff. We just have to do something random, something exciting. Something we've never done before. Game! Thank you, guys. It's gonna be so fun! -[Dani] Finish your shot! -Drink. [cheering] Yes! -Okay, game. -Go, babe. Go, go, go! Woo! [exhales] -Game! -Go, babe! [woman] On three. One, two... [screaming] That's our brave girl. There. [gasps] [Dani] Oh, my god! How was it? It didn't hurt. Huh? It didn't hurt? But we just heard you go... [screaming] Oh, really? Brace yourself. You're next. This seems like an easy challenge. Fine, I will give up being a vegan for a day. Let's get this done and over with. Okay... Wait a minute. -That's not yours. -What? Huh? We ordered something special for you, girl. Here it is. Surprise! Ta-dah! [mouthing] What the heck. Eat it. What's this? Try it. Go. Try it? Can't you see it has veins? -Babe! -Go ahead. I can't do it. You're so dramatic. Just try it. We even asked them not to slice the cow's penis. Yuck! This is cow penis? Babe, give me something else. I can't do this. Come on, it's a challenge. -You have to do it. -Quick, before it gets cold. Can you do it? Can you? This is the best part. [gasps] Yummy! Damn, look at it. -Game! -Go, Dani! Go, Dani! Go! Poke it! Wait a minute! -Take a bite. -Damn, wait. I can't do it. I really can't. -Do it. -Babe! This one. Let me do it. Do it before it gets cold. Yummy! I can't do it. Ugh! Put it in your mouth. Yum! Yes! [retching] Oh, my gosh. She ate this. Woo! Yes! So, it's your turn. This was your idea, right? Are you ready? Let's do this, bitch. Welcome to Flo's challenge! So, guys. Is Flo here? No! She's here! Okay, so the challenge is to seduce a random guy, pull him inside the comfort room, and convince him to give her his mobile phone. But knowing Flo, she can do it. She once said that she can get any guy using her good looks. So, let's see if she can really do it. Girls... -Yes? -Oh, my god. -Mission accomplished. -Oh, my god! [squealing] Quick! You bitch! Give me back my pants and my phone! [Dani] Babe. Flo, look. You got the most number of likes. -Oh, right! -Congrats. Thanks, babe. If only Flo had given me a better challenge. I'm gonna do better at the party. Wow, competitive. [Arianne] Oh, you know it! [girls laughing] [Dani] So pretty. Going live! -Hi! -Hello, guys! So, this is it! Later, we're off to the Epik Party. This is gonna be so lit! But before that, I'd like to thank T3 Essentials for giving me this package. I think, they were amazed with our pre-event posts even if we didn't have that much interactions, but we still managed to gain followers. -[Flo] Yeah! -Yes. Most are foreigners, right? [Dani] Really, you, too? You know what? I got the same. Most of my followers are Arabs and Chinese. Arianne, don't you think this is a scam? -[Flo] Huh? -[Arianne] Dani, shut up. -[Dani] Oops, sorry. -I'm on live. Anyway, guys! So, we'll just get ready. We'll update you later. Dani might say more stupid stuff in the background. -Bye! -Bye! Bye, guys! [party music] [Dani] Arianne, do you really know that Chloe? Don't be paranoid! I worked for her as an atmosphere model before. She's legit. Atmosphere model? Yeah. They'll invite you to their event just to party. For added face value, something like that. And having lots of beautiful people invited means better pictures. And people pay for that? Yup. Wait. So, you're like a crying lady, but instead of crying, you're just partying? Exactly. [party music] [crowd jamming] [party music intensifies] Come on. Let's go. Babe, you have a third eye. Huh? -You see dead people? -Look! Wait. Just relax, okay? [Arianne] Here, let's take some shots. Cheers, babes! [Flo] Cheers! [Arianne] This is gonna be an epic night. [party music continues] Hi! Arianne, right? Yes. I'm Chloe. Oh! Hi, Miss Chloe! -Hi, hello! -You look different in person. -Huh? I didn't expect that you are more beautiful. You flatter me. Uhm... Are they your friends? Yup. Oh... Uhm... Enjoy yourselves. Just have fun tonight, okay? And let me borrow Arianne for a bit. Is that okay? Oh... Okay. Let's go. Girls, have fun! [Flo] Okay, so that bitch left us just like that. Like, what the heck! -Yeah, that's weird. -Right? No, I'm just really pissed-- No, I mean... What? Babe, Arianne said that she knew Chloe from way back. But, didn't you see that? It's like they just met. I don't know. But I'm just pissed that she left us just like that. Okay, don't you think we should go find her? I feel like something is wrong. -Let's go. -No. Babe, I think you're being a paranoid Virgo right now. Can you just please calm down? Okay then. Just wait for me. -Huh? -I'll be back. -Dani! -Wait. Dani, oh, my... Ugh! Damn. [party music] [Dani] Oh, my god! Sorry. -Are you okay? -Yeah. Well, they said, this is a mannequin factory before it became a club. That's why, check out the display. So, you just give out random trivia to strangers? [sighs] Okay, how about this. Come on! Take it! My hands are shivering already. I'm telling you, they could get numb. Please? -Please, please, please... -Okay. Yes! Uhm... What's your favorite tree? Favorite tree? What? Why? [Jason] Nothing, just a hunch. [chuckles] All right, I'll tell you. Here's why. That's the favorite pick-up line of my college friend. Nothing. I decided to use it, hoping it might work on you. Well... if I would have a favorite tree, it would be coconut. -Coconut. -Yeah. Wow! Interesting. Okay. Why coconut? Because it's really useful, right? Even if it's usually overlooked by people... It's taken for granted because it's pretty common, right? Unlike narra, right? Say it's pretty strong, and sought after. You know, I'm not that kind of tree. I'm just a basic ass coconut! Wait, wait, wait. Why the wave of emotion? Huh? Nope! You're the one who's asking. -Right? -Right. But, okay... if there's any consolation, I think, narra trees are already endangered, so... once they become extinct, I'm pretty sure, coconuts like you will get more attention. You know what, if our conversations are to be like this the whole night, I think, you need to get me more drinks. [Jason] Well... Drinks on me! [Dani chuckling] [glasses clink] Let's go. [party music] What are you having? Uh... White Russian. I'll have what she's having. Vee. Flo. Nice to meet you, Flo. Nice meeting you. Flo like water? Yup. Well... Florence. Yuck, right? [Vee] No, that's okay. Me, it's Vilma. [both chuckling] You alone? No, I'm with my friends. It's just that we went our separate ways. I guess, we separated a bit. [chuckling] Wait. Are you the girl in the teaser for this event? It's you! -Oh, my! You have watched that? -Yeah! Anyways, do you wanna join us? Uhm... the girls are at our table. Mid-level influencers, like that. So, you won't look like a sad doll here at the bar. Sure. Looks like my friends won't look for me anyway. Let's go? -[Flo] Yeah, sure. -Cheers! -Cheers. -Cheers! [party music] [Vee] Ladies! Listen up, listen up. I would like you to meet Flo! -Hi, Flo! -Hi, Flo! She's so pretty, right? -Yeah! -So pretty. But I saw her at the bar alone. Oh, why? -Because her friends left her. -Aww. Because they have their own business here at the party! -No way. -Fake friends. Nonsense. That's why, girls... Let's all welcome Flo! [girls] Welcome, Flo! [Jason] I already know you. Well, actually, it's my boss. My boss showed me your video. And he's really obsessed with it. Maybe that's the reason why we attended this party. -[chuckles] -That's crazy. [Jason] No, I'm serious. I mean, he's at the VIP area. I'll introduce him to you later. So, your boss is looking for influencers? Well, you can say that. [Chloe] Wait a bit. Let's wait for them. Sure. [chuckles] Sorry. I can't stop looking at you. You're such a pretty girl. Your eyes. Your hair. My hair was exactly like that when I was your age. [chuckles] Yes. I saw it on your account. No, that was a wig! Yeah. Wig. It looks so natural. Okay. Let me show you how it looks without a wig. It looks like this. I didn't know. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. It's okay. It's me who showed it to you. Do you have, like, alopecia or cancer? No, I don't. I just shave it every freaking day. You know, my current boyfriend, he likes skinhead girls. So, every night, he caresses the top of my head. And he will kiss it. And sometimes, he will lick it. Do you really have to do it for love? [Chloe] Love? Oh, honey, this has nothing to do with love, okay? Look. The world is not fair, and I'm not sure if it will ever be fair. So, while it's not yet fair, women like us need to step up the game to get what we want. And if it takes the loss of my hair just to get the things that I have now, why not? We need to survive, Arianne. [Jason] This is your first time in Epik, right? Well, I was invited by my friend, Arianne. Her Instagram was hacked, so she's building her network again from the bottom. -Uhm. Wait. Arianne? -Yeah. Actually, my boss also likes her. But... he feels that she's a bit violent. [Dani] Arianne's nice. There are just things she went through that made her tough. -[knocking loudly] -Help! Emergency! Help! Have you been here the whole time? [Dani] Actually, the three of us. But she is the toughest. Maybe because... we were all bullied when we were younger. One of our friends, Flo, she looked like a nerd. The bullies thought that she was a genius because of her looks. That's why the bullies picked on her more. As for Arianne, her family is struggling financially. Bullies, when they're bored, they just wanna pick on people lower than them. [Jason] How about you? What's your story? Why were you bullied? [Dani] When I was younger, I was obese. Until one day, we've had enough. Arianne had this idea on how we could take revenge. Where did you hide Mika's phone?! Where did you hide it? What's this about, Emma?! -It's Mika's! -[Slaps] [Dani] Mika, is this your phone? You left it in the washroom. [Mika] Give me that. Let's get some milk tea. Were you able to record that? [Flo] Of course. [Dani] And we succeeded. We were able to expel the bullies from school. Suddenly, we became the popular girls in school. That's when I realized that without my friends, I wouldn't have survived high school. [Jason] You said you can't survive without your friends? Well, that's nonsense! Because you know what? Beneath that pretty, sweet... innocent face... lies a strong, courageous woman. I love this song. You wanna dance? Yeah. [upbeat music] -[girls cheering] -Go, Flo! [Flo] Among the three of us, I have the most number of boyfriends. My friend Dani, uh... she had one boyfriend. They were together for three years. No sex, okay? When she decided to do it with her guy, that's when she found out that the guy was no longer interested and they broke up. As for my other friend, Arianne, she would have a couple of flings, but then... usually, it would only last for a few weeks. The longest perhaps lasted for two months. [Vee's friend] So, were you able to do it? Did you succeed in the challenge? What do you think? -Oooh. -Yes. -Duh. -[laughing] -[Vee] Flo. -Hmm? Why don't we try this time? What? Try to seduce Nathalia. Wooh! [Vee's friend] Go, Flo. You can do it! Come on. I can't. Please. No. Go, Flo! -Come on. -Now? Yes! -No! -I can't. -Go, Flo. -Fine! Yes! [Vee] Wait! Wait! Wait! I was just teasing you. Come on! Gotta do it. She's good. Yeah, oh, my god! I love this. You know what? Why don't you join us? We know a place. Mm-hmm. It's getting a bit boring here anyway. Yeah... I mean, I'm enjoying the night. [Vee's friend] Don't you say no. Let's go! Game? -Let's go? -Yeah. [Vee's friend] Let's go! [girls cheering] We're very sorry. We're late. We had a lot of business, that's why. [Chloe] Yeah, it's all good. No worries. Uhm... I'll just leave you guys with Arianne, okay? -Okay. -Okay. Remember what I told you. You need to always step up. Okay. Please join her. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. Good luck. Thank you. [Chloe] Arianne, good luck. -[Man] Hello. How are you? -Hi. We saw your audition. Sorry, what audition? Your video. Your belly button ring. We like it very much. Yeah, so, can we see it? Oh! Uhm, maybe later? Okay. Okay. What's your job? Well, uhm... I'm at the university right now, but I'm also an influencer. What specialization? Uhm... Mostly make-up tutorials, -food reviews. -No, no, no. What do you study? Oh! Marketing. Marketing? So, how many followers? Well, actually, my account got hacked. So, right now, I have 4,000. Oh, very few. So, what do you think if we make you a model for our family business in Dubai? And you will get more followers. What do you think? Oh! A lot of money. Yes. What's your family business? Actually, it's, uh... luxury cars. Do you wanna join us? Ah, yes. Yes, of course. [Man] I have one favor. Go with us, sign a waiver. That's it. Waiver? For what? Uh, actually, this is "haram." No one knows about this. So, let's go and sign the waiver. What's "haram?" You know what? Let's talk outside. More quiet there. Let's go. -Let's go. -Okay. [Jason] Do you like to travel? [Dani] Well, I like the idea of traveling, but I haven't traveled that much though. [Jason] Well, how about China? Do you like China? -China... -I mean, China's beautiful. [Dani] Aren't we a province of China yet? [both chuckling] [Jason] Yeah. Okay. All right. My boss can accommodate you if you wanna go to China with him. What? Your boss? Yeah. I mean, like what I said, he's so obsessed with your video. Even more when he saw you... munch on that cow's dick. And with the short time we've been together, I know... you can get along with him very well. So... Let's go? Wait! Hold on a sec! I don't understand anything. What?! Don't worry. I mean, my boss is very generous. Just name your price. Just be good to him. What the hell! Sorry, but I think you got the wrong message! Damn. Hey, Dani! Hey, Dani! Damn it! Ugh! Damn it, damn it! [sniffs] Damn. [Arianne] One moment. Arianne. Be honest with me. What kind of party is this? Arianne, this is a cover-up party for escorts and clients to hook up! Babe! Don't be overdramatic, okay? Everything I've told you, it's true! This is how influencers build their network. How do you think they can afford going on trips, like Dubai? How can they have their pictures taken with Ferraris, Maseratis? They go to events like this! Talk to people like them. Really? I think you forgot the part where we have to sell our bodies! No, no, no. You don't have to have sex! You're just gonna talk! And if they give you an offer, you're free to say yes or decline. You're messed up! Just think of it this way... It's either they use you or you use them. You know, the only thing that I can see right now is that you used me and Flo! Arianne, why are we even friends with you?! Wait! If you hadn't taken that video of me in that bar, I wouldn't have lost thousands of followers, and I don't have to resort to this! So blame yourself! You're a piece of crap! Well, good luck on your endeavors. And I freaking regret knowing you! [footsteps] [girls cheering] Yeah! [laughing] Oh, shoot! Wait. Where are we going? Our limo's here. We're going to our place. All right. Come on! [Vee's friend] Vee, what are you waiting for? Coming! [Flo] Guys, I'll just get my phone, okay? Babe, I'll just get my phone because... -I have to text my... -It's okay. -No, no, no. -We'll just get it later. -Let's go! -I need to find my phone. It's okay. Let's go! Let's go! [Dani shouting] Flo! Flo! -[crowd] Flo! Flo! Flo! -[laughs] Flo! -[grinds] -Damn it! What have you done?! What have you done?! I thought we had an understanding?! Now, my boss is pissed! Jason, please. Please, I don't know. I was just brought here by my friend. -[coughs] -Please let me go! Please? Please? You freaking tramp! You freaking drama queen! The only thing you need to do is to make my boss happy. Make him happy! Like this! -[slurps] -[growls] Like that! Damn you! Now, after that, he's gonna pay you! And me? I'll get paid for my finder's fee. Remember that! So that everybody's happy! [whines] Damn you! I'm not for sale! -Go to hell! -[whines] Hey. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm good, but... I just don't feel like Beyonce, you know? [Vee chuckling] Like, I need to level up my energy. Don't worry, baby girl. You will be. We're here! [girls cheering] [Vee] Wait. I'll introduce you. Oh. Flo, I would like you to meet the organizer of Epic, Triple A. Triple A? Is that your real name? [Triple A] No, just my initials. But most people just call me Triple A. Wow! You can speak Tagalog?

You want more? Dani! Dani! [shouting] What did you do? You can't escape! You bitch! [grunts] [screams] [upbeat music playing in the background] [all groaning] [shrieking] [pants] Is this what you want? I'll give it to you! Just die! You bitch! -This is what you deserve! -[choking] [screaming] Arianne! Let go of me! You're both worthless! [shrieks] [yelping] [shouts] What? [music stops] What? [sobbing] What? I'm sorry. Sorry.

Babe, babe, babe. Babe, you have to do this. Let me help. [crying] Babe. Babe, it's okay. Dani, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought I freaking knew better. I just... I just want to have nice things. I just want a better life for my family, Dani. You and Flo, all your lives, you have that. As for me, I'm just starting to achieve all these for my family. [sobs] Babe. I'm sorry, Dani. Shhh... -This is all my fault, Dani. -No, it's not. -I'm sorry. -Shhh... Is Triple A... not going to join us dance? I'm just gonna watch. That's boring! Have you been staying long here in the Philippines? Not too long. What's your work? What's your job here? I.T. I.T.? He's building a multimillion social media empire. [gasps] No way! What? Hey, maybe you need an influencer? Maybe I can be a part of that. Maybe you need me. Make me famous! -Look! -Yeah. But fame... is like a double-edged sword. It can either make you or break you. As for me, I prefer to be discreet. I can fulfill all my desires without the gaze of others. They say... That's where you can truly be yourself. [chuckles] That's deep. "Fulfill my desires without the gaze of others." That's just a fetish. [laughs] [Triple A] Maybe. So what's your fetish? [grunting] [groaning] [sobbing] [gasping] [Triple A] Pull her hair! [crying] Slap her! You, feed her cake and choke her. [crying] [laughing] -[shrieking] -[laughing] It's okay. You will survive this, baby girl. I've been in the same situation. Let go of me, please. Please! Shut up! -[crying] -[laughing] You wanted to be a queen bee, right? [laughs] This is what it takes to make our king happy. [both grunting] [clamoring] Go get that girl! What the heck happened to my show, Vee? You better fix this. This is not what I paid for. You're going to get what you paid for. I'm going to get that bitch! -[siren wailing] -Help! Sir! Sir, help us! Good evening, madams. Looks like you've been through a war, huh? It's because we came from a party. Then some of the guys there tried to rape us, and some of them chased us. [both] They wanted to kill us. Rape? Why are you dressed like that? Maybe... You know... You're giving them the go signal. -Huh? -What? Wait... Damn! Aren't you cops? We're the victims here. -Just come with us. -Huh? -Let me go! -Wait, sir. We got a report that you were the ones-- [clamoring] Arianne! [grunting] [gunshots] Let's go. Babe, keys. Shit! Phone? There. [panting] Phone. Found anything? Babe. Is this Flo? Yeah, that's her. Look who she's with. Babe. [keypad clacking] [line ringing] [female operator] Van For Less. Hello, good evening. Uhm... [clears throat] Hello, this is Apple Sy. I rented a van... [female operator] Our driver confirmed that your group was already dropped off at the destination. In fact, he's there right now. What? I'm not there yet. Who did he pick up? I'm still at the pick-up location. [female operator] He's already at the destination, Ma'am. Where is that? How incompetent! How long before he can pick me up here? [female operator] Barangay Kaimito, about five minutes away. Babe, Barangay Kaimito. Just five minutes away. We're really close. -Okay, let's go. -[engine starts] Just tell me where to go. [siren wails] [classical music plays] [panting, sobbing] [classical music continues playing] [heels clacking lightly] [classical music continues playing] [sobbing] [footsteps approaching] That bitch! You, go there! Wait! [door opens] -[glass shatters] -[shouts] [grunting] [classical music continues in background] [siren wailing] [gunshot] [both grunting] [shrieking] [wails] [grunting, thudding] [screams] [classical music swells] [gunshot] [groaning] [grunting] [gunshot] [wails] [panting] [grunting] [screaming] [Triple A whimpering] [dry fire] Damn! [screaming] [panting] Flo! Flo! Let's go. Let's go. Flo! Flo! Flo, hang on. [sobbing] [crying] Flo, let's go. Flo! Flo, wake up! [female reporter] An unconscious and beaten woman was brought in by her friends after attending a party, which turned out to be a prostitution scheme. According to her friends, they, too, could have been raped if they hadn't fought back and escaped. According to police investigation... [male cop] We searched through the warehouse they reported. We found nothing. As for the rented mansion, we haven't talked to the owner yet because he's out of the country. [camera shutter clicking] Did you see the #EpikParty? It's gone. Everything's deleted. Even our pre-event posts were gone. And the people online are saying that these are all fake news. My god! This is not fake news! This is a cover-up. Damn it. Just look at our situation and condition right now. We will expose this! The truth will come out. [reporter] What can you say about the comments that you have no one to blame but yourselves? That you know nothing but vanity, and you're all attention hogs on social media. And those are what put you in danger. Any comments? [ominous music intensifies] [theme music playing]
