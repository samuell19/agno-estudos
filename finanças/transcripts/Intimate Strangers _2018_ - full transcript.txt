The ice is way too thick! Can’t you hit it harder? Then you do it! Whoa! We caught one! We got one! I brought a lighter. (SOKCHO, 1984) - It's salty! -Carp don't live in the sea. It's a lake. It's even called Youngrang Lake! But it’s filled with rockfish and trout! Those idiots are always fighting. But we only caught carp! It’s the sea! Watch it! - Look! It’s a heart! - Wow Should I give it to Young-joo or Kyung-sook? Not Go Eun-hee? We broke up a long time ago. Sorry! Hey! Why are you always late? Can't you be on time? Got caught by my dad. He made me finish my homework first. I’m glad my dad’s a skipper and not a principal. I’m glad my mom works at the market. Seok-ho? You’re smart! Tell him! - It’s the sea, right? - You retard! - The sea doesn’t freeze like this! - Jerk! What did you say? Fight! Kill each other. - Why you! - Jerk! Retard! - Wanna die under the moonlight? - Let go! Cut it out! Stop! Stop it! It’s starting! What? - Lunar eclipse! -The moon’s disappearing! That’s so cool! I heard a curse falls when the moon turns red. You're full of it. You've never seen a lunar eclipse before, huh? - I have! When I was young! - What? Like when you were two? (34 YEARS LATER) Yes. He got his shots for corona, kennel cough, and rabies, right? Then it’s okay. Vaccinations don’t last forever. Get antibody tests done, too. Right. Yes. Yes. A rash? Since when? Mom! You used your shampoo again? You have to use puppy shampoo to wash him. Fine. I’ll come next week. Of course he’s coming. Don’t call your son-in-law a thief! Are you crazy? Not you. The dog. - Stop it, Terry! - Woof! Woof! Stop it. Going somewhere? I told you I was going to the movies with Hyun-a. Expect me to believe that? Then don’t. You’re going to meet Jae-ho. I am not! You always yell when I catch you lying. You’re only deceiving yourself, not others, by lying. It’ll eventually ruin you. Say that corny stuff to your patients, not me. I’m fine! Don’t treat me like a patient. Fine? Then what’s this? Don’t touch my stuff! You went through my bag? - Get out! - What in the world! Why would I have lunch with the opposition's father? I don’t care who he is! You know how I work. Look. Third line in paragraph two, page 31. They can’t win. Just stick to the books. I didn’t hear this. What a headache… It’s time to go. What? It’s time. Right. I still have 3 minutes. - Is it ironed crisp? - Yes. It felt damp last time. Your makeup is too heavy. But this is the norm. It’s heavy. She’s driving me insane! A psychiatrist can’t go insane. I’m in no mood for jokes. She’s meeting Jae-ho. Ye-jin? So-young is 20 years-old. It’s natural for her to meet her boyfriend on the weekend. I don’t like him. You said so, too. But So-young likes him. She’s crazy. Wife is insane. Daughter is crazy? What do I do? Should I call and tell him to stop seeing her? That's it? Why not go and slap him hard? Send people to threaten him. Go to his parents’ store and smash it up. It needs to cook more. I’m sorry dad did that. Silly! I didn’t say that for an apology. Just saying it’s no use. Though he did that, see? We’re just fine. You’ve consulted many people struggling with disapproving parents. You encouraged and comforted them. That’s who you are. But she’s my daughter. I can’t approach it objectively like she’s a patient. Then don’t! Just don’t chase her away. Okay? Shoot, shoot! - Please? - Get lost! You suck! - Turn the TV off and tidy up. - No way! Daddy’s coming! I’ll clean up later. Get going. Mother? Please don’t give them cookies, their skin will break out. And please make them go to bed before 10:00 p.m. No need, mom. Take care of yourselves, okay? - Yes! - Don’t trouble Granny. Mom, I’m sorry it's just us going out. It’s okay. Got your hair done? It looks great! You should have gotten it done sooner. - Doesn’t Granny look pretty? - Yes! We’ll get going. - Let’s go. - Say bye. - Bye daddy and mommy! - Bye. Oops! I forgot my cell phone. Delicious! Honey, try some. What’s in it? Come on. Lighten up. It’s our housewarming party! So-young has condoms. How do you know that? I found one in her bag. Oh no, Ye-jin… You went through her bag? That’s not what matters. Your daughter is carrying condoms around! You know what that means! - Listen. - She’s rebelling! She’s telling us to lay off! Then let her be. What if something bad happens? She’s still just a kid. When I was 20… I had two rubber tubs at the market. Not again! Enough! I sold vegetables! I sold it outside other people’s stores! My parents? They were too busy to pay attention to us. When I returned from military duty, know what mom said? “Why the uniform? Going to the military?” But look at me. I grew up just fine. No problem. No. With no parental care, you got me pregnant in school. But that’s… No way! - I won’t let her go. - Ye-jin! (Intimate Strangers) Wow! Look at the moon! It’s so pretty. “If I was the moon,” “some beams would fall on his window, too.” Poem by Kim So-wol. It’s amazing how it’ll disappear in an hour. Slow down over a speed bump. Don’t talk like that. What? Telling mom what to do. She’s not a maid. But honey… “Afflicted by you and dry,” “I burn by the angry fire in your eyes.” “Firewood” by Seo Deok-jun. If you have time for taking poetry class, read more to the kids. - We’re going to mom’s next week. - Really? I haven’t seen her in so long. You’re happy? I wouldn't go if it wasn’t for her dog. She didn’t even come to see your new restaurant. I’m old and poor. You paid for the wedding and the restaurant. She must hate me. But I love her. She gave birth to this ugly girl! You always say the sweetest things, baby! I must be crazy! I wanna do it again. Should I stop the car? - No! - I’m serious! Touch it. - I’ll take off my pants! - No! I’ll get it! Long time no see! Come on in! Wow! It’s a palace in here! - Hi! - Good to see you, Su-hyeon! Show some respect. I was born before you. I got married before you. Well, I got more kids. I got more women. I did it 4 times today. What? Breast implants. Hi Tae-su! - Hi Su-hyeon. - Hi. Good to see you. I made some Tiramisu. I hope it tastes okay. That’s her specialty. Is that a rice cake? It looks delicious! - Must be Jun-mo. - I’ll go. Ye-jin looks better, huh? Aren’t the pants too tight? You noticed? How can you not? - Come in. - Welcome! Hi! - Country boy made it big! - Right! - Here! Congratulations. - You didn’t have to. - It’s nothing big. - What is it? Why’d it take you a year to host a housewarming party? What party? It’s just dinner with friends. - Open it. I’m curious. - Sure. - Aren’t we eating first? - What is it? - Birds? - How pretty! In the West, the owl symbolizes Athena, the goddess of wisdom. In Japan, they believe owls bring wealth and honor. And it encourages couples to make love. - Thank you very much! - Have another kid! What’s that smell? Wait! I know this. It’s not squid sausage. North Korean-style sausage! That’s it! He insisted on serving your hometown food. - I got Pollack sushi salad, too. - Really? Rice cake, fried chicken, raw fish, red crab, and snailfish soup! Snailfish soup? - Let’s eat till we die! - Awesome! Want some wine or corn-rice wine? I want Soju. They’re so excited. - He’s so different with friends. - I know. My god! The bathtub! It’s designed by Karim Rashid. It was really hard to get. It’s beautiful! Want me to get you one when you move? Really? Thanks Ye-jin! Is this crocodile? Nile crocodile with big cracks. It’s not great. No. It looks luxurious. It feels really different. It’s birch. Oh please. What? That made in China owl doesn’t suit a place like this. You saw it too? Well, China is famous for its pottery. Anyway, I envy you. You’re pretty and smart. Your husband’s a successful plastic surgeon and your daughter is a top student. I heard you bought prime land to build a hospital? We got a great deal. I’m happy for you. Think that’s enough? That’s good. Are we going to start without Young-bae? Must be doing homework again. - Rice wine? - I’ll have wine. Young-bae’s bringing a date? Know who she is? Well, her name is Min-seo. Min-seo? I think she’ll be pretty. Young-bae’s girlfriend? How could she be? Why? - Girls like guys like Young-bae. - Right! He’s manly and kind of sexy. Young-bae? Did you just say some other guy is sexy? Of course you’re the sexiest, baby! What if Young-bae brings a divorced woman with kids? Who cares as long as she’s single. I hope she’s better than Su-jung. Who’s Su-jung? Young-bae’s ex-wife. She was mean, but still pretty. Pretty? She wasn’t pretty. How could you say that? I have no idea how women decide who's pretty or not. Me neither. Want me to tell you? If women say, “She’s annoying!” It means she’s pretty. That’s right! That’s so true! No way! - He’s right! - No! Rice cake! He’s here! What’s her name again? - Min-seo! - Let’s meet her! Come on in! Hi! What? Where’s Min-seo? Ah… she had a fever. So, she’s not coming? She couldn’t. She’s not well. - Should I just go? - Yes! It took me over an hour and a half to get here. - I’m leaving! - Who cares? - Did she dump you? - No, she’s sick. - How old? - Same age as us. Then of course she’s sick. - Divorced or married? - What? We were guessing what kind of woman she was. So? I can only date women with problems? Those aren't problems these days. But being 45 and single is. Young-bae, Have a drink. - Thanks. - It looks good! The lunar eclipse is starting! Let’s go watch! Remember the lunar eclipse we watched as kids? Tae-su and Soon-dae fought then. Really? Tae-su was a fighter. I was not. It was about Youngrang Lake… Whether it’s a lake or the sea! What’s the answer? There is none. It has both sea and fresh water. Keep it simple. Catch a rockfish, it’s the sea. Catch a carp, it’s a lake. Bingo, Jun-mo! My baby is so smart! And you catch dimples. She doesn’t wanna hear it. - Can you see? - Come look. Why didn’t you introduce us to your girlfriend? I wasn’t sure if we’re serious. So, now you are? Did you do it? You always think dirty. - Who doesn’t do it here? - Still! So now, you two are in love? Maybe? Ye-jin? - How do you know if you’re in love? - That idiot doesn't know a thing about love. Why are you asking me? Don’t psychiatrists know stuff like that? I know! If you call each other more than 3 times a day, you’re in love. If it’s more than 5 times? You’re crazy or possessive. If you don’t call at all, you’re a married couple. - Call her. - Come here and try this! Come inside. I see. Married couples don’t call each other. Let’s try it. I haven’t had this in so long. This cake is great! It’s made with Sokcho corn flour. Isn’t it good? I made it. It’s great! It’s because of good ingredients. It costs ten times more than imported flour. - Really? - Yes! Should I sell corn? Still haven’t come to your senses? I was just kidding! We got our wedding pictures. Soon-dae and his wife are in the pictures. What happened to Soon-dae? He paid a huge alimony and got divorced. How can he have an affair with his agency’s actress trainee? His wife fell ill from shock and was hospitalized. Really? Did you know, honey? What? That he was cheating on her? No. Come on. You knew. Of course. How would we know? So what if we did? You should’ve told his wife. Tell her? That he’s cheating on her with a 21-year-old actress trainee? - She’s 21? - Wasn’t she 22? - 21! - 21. Singer trainee. Sorry. See? They knew but pretended they didn’t. I’ll make myself clear. If my baby here ever cheats on me, please tell me. Really wanna know? I have books on him. - Shut up! - You'll regret it. Men will never tell. How could you do that? That’s just them. Men and women think totally differently. Simply put, we’re like iPhones and Android phones. - What are men? - Androids, of course. They’re cheap, easy to use, and get viruses easily. If you don’t update them daily, they become useless. That’s so true. If I don’t take care of Tae-su, he can’t do anything. That’s funny? So, women are iPhones? Of course! We’re pretty, staunchy and smart. Expensive, stubborn, and incompatible. Only have fun with each other! - Bingo! - It’s true! No way! I thought I was going to die. Someone pulled me out just in time. - Hurry! - Is it good? Of course! You made it. - Good? - Yup. So, Soon-dae is out of our gatherings? Let’s leave him out. How can we eat with a silly 21-year-old? I thought he was better than that. It’s too bad. A family torn apart just because of one text message. It’s not from the text message, but the 21-year-old girl. He should’ve erased the messages. He was careless. Careless? I mean Soon-dae was wrong. That he cheated or didn’t erase the message? Why are you picking on me? Stay put. Anyway, our cell phones have way too much information. Call list. Shopping lists. Messages, locations, schedules. It’s like the blackbox of our lives. I’m sure some of us won’t be able to show our phones. This is good. Tae-su will never show his phone. He keeps flipping it over these days. I don’t do that. Yes, you do. Maybe the front is silly. Or he likes the back more. The ass! That silly bastard. What’s that? Fine. I’ll put it down. Put yours out, too. I only have alarms and messages to take care of Mother and the kids. - And notices from poetry class. - That damn class. The perfect, devoted wife. You suit each other perfectly. Se-kyung? Can you show Jun-mo your phone? Of course! My phone isn’t even locked. Look. No. I’m only looking at you. Really? Me too! How about you? I have nothing to hide, but pictures of women’s breasts. Before and after. - Let’s see. - No way, man. You should't look at it. She's right. So, no one here has any secrets? Not with these guys. To Sokcho High! Let’s go Sokcho High! Thanks for coming. What secrets would friends of forty years have? I saw him masturbate 7 times a day back in high school. Stop it! - Wanna play a game? - A game? Put your cell phones on the table. Let’s share all our messages and calls during dinner. All notices. Even emails. What? You said you don’t have secrets. Cool! It sounds fun. Sure! You came alone here. And no one to call you. What kind of game is this? Why? Got something to hide? No. I’m worried that you have something to hide. If I’m cheating on you, would I do this? - Right. - Right. Take yours out too. What? Why are you laughing? Got something to hide? Of course not! Then take it out. It sounds fun! Isn’t this crazy? It makes no sense. Why do this? Hey! He touched his phone! - Don’t cheat! - What? What did you do? What did you just do? Nothing! I just picked it up to look. No touching! You can block senders or erase messages and calls. So, no touching! - Right! - Okay, fine! It’s part of the game. - Hello. - Hi! Hi, So-young. She's all grown up! Say hello. Didn’t you hear them come? You were home? - Long time no see! - Such a pretty college student. You resemble your mom. - She’s prettier. - Dad? Got a second? - Sure. - Aren’t you eating with us? She used to be this big! Can I have some money? You ran out? Why didn’t you ask your mom? I don’t want to talk to her. I was like that too when I was dating him. I’d pack him lunches and do his laundry. I didn’t think it was hard work. I was so happy and in love. I wish I could go back to then. Why? You want to date him again? No! I want to break up with the cranky law student. It’s not too late to leave. See? He’s cranky. “We submerged ourselves in love,” “and raced to see who’d last longer.” Not again. “One forfeited and left to play elsewhere.” “But I sink not knowing he is gone.” It’s a poem called, “Submerged.” Just thought of it. Someone got a text. It’s mine. Should we read the texts out loud? Of course! Go on. Read it. Why? “I miss your body”? - What’s that? - We’re off to a great start. I don’t know this number. See? It’s not even saved. - Then who’d send that? - Who cares? Now, the person is calling. Take the call. Answer it. Fine. Hello? Hello? Put it on speaker. Hello? Hello? Speak up! Who is this? Me! You fool! Holy! He got so scared! You scared me, jerk! You scared us! - What was that? - Just pulling a prank. Give me my phone. I gotta go. It’s So-young’s phone. - See you. - Enjoy your meal. Bye! See you next time! Going to meet her boyfriend? No way. She’s going to the movies with her friend Hyun-a. What a pretty girl with such good manners. I wish our baby will be like So-young, don’t you? Are you pregnant? No, not yet. We’re thinking about it though. That’s good. You must have kids. Why? What? Why must you have kids? Well, humans get married then have kids. So if I got married, then divorced, and have no kids, I’m not human? What are you saying, man? I was just talking about people in general. You’ll marry Min-seo and have kids, won’t you? Just because most people do, doesn’t mean I have to. Just because most people do, doesn’t mean I have to. That’s true. But if a couple has kids, it builds stronger bonds. And I think I’ll be happier. So, you can’t be happy unless you depend on others? Are you drunk? What the hell? I’m just saying. It’s like when we talked about god last time. Why do people depend on others? I hate that. I can do fine on my own. Right! You do it alone 7 times a day! It’s not just about depending on others. Some people feel like they’re living second lives in raising kids. Right. Watching them grow year by year, I feel like I’m living life twice. I don’t want to live twice. If I were you, I wouldn’t want that either. Me neither. Who put their phone on vibrate? It’s my dad. - Answer it on speaker phone. - Okay. - Hello? - It’s me. Dad? You’re on speakerphone. - Don’t tell him! - Cheating! Why? Turn it off! I can’t, so don’t say anything weird. It’s so noisy! Principal Lee? It’s Seok-ho, sir. Hello, sir! It’s Tae-su. How are you? Seok-ho and Tae-su, my proud boys who went to Seoul University! - How’ve you been? - Good, sir! - Jun-mo! Say hello! - Say hi. Sir? It’s Jun-mo. You still hang out with that hopeless fool? See? He hates me! I forgot I’m on speakerphone. I’ll call you back later. Wait! I’m not going to Jeju Island. Let’s talk later. Don’t skip your meals. Sorry about that. I’ll stick to the rules next time. You all know my dad. He’ll talk for hours. - We know. - What’s that about Jeju Island? He found me a job there. A private high school owned by his friend. Why not go? It’s nice there. It’s too far. So, why’d you quit teaching? Did something happen? Nothing special. Kids don’t listen. They have no respect for teachers. I quit before I beat one of them and cripple them for life. You should’ve been a fighter rather than a gym teacher. Why’d you listen to your dad? How about going to Cambodia and start a business with me? Not again! Listen up. Tapioca is the best there. We can make a fortune! - Man… - We just have to plant them and water them. It rains every day in Cambodia, squall. He’s out of his mind. Why go to Cambodia? I’m not going. I’ll send him. You opened your restaurant a month ago. Stop. Don’t make me nervous. - But this is a sure thing! - Stop. You said the duck growth agent would be a hit. Right! What happened? According to him, the ducks grew too big to maintain themselves and died! the ducks grew too big to maintain themselves and died! I admit that was a flop. Just that one? Remember? Your sodium-free salt with no salty taste bombed. The ginseng from Mt. Baek-du? It was high in heavy metal content! And your waterproof clothes that couldn’t be washed! Cut it out! That’s enough. He blew all his father’s money. He has no talent for business. It’s not talent he doesn’t have. I said Jeju is far, and he's telling me to go to Cambodia. - He has no brain. - Come here, you idiot! Say something! They always pick on me! Stop saying stuff to my baby. Next time just do this! And hit him! Why you! - Come to your senses! - Too late. - Let’s clean up and start round 2! - Sure! That’s enough. When do you get to drive again? It’s killing me, man. A lawyer being tried as a defendant, it sucks. I want it over with. - By the way, - It’s needs more salt. how’s the hospital coming along? - Still under construction? - Yes. Keep an eye on things until it’s done and registered. - Tae-su? - What? About the Sokcho resort… The damn con-artists. They ran off with the investments! What about it? Why? I’m so stupid. I told you it was fishy and not to invest in it! How much did you blow? - $2 million. - What! - What’s taking so long? - Ye-jin doesn’t know. Be quiet. Where’d you get the money? Equity loan on this house and the hospital. We’re all here for a party. Pretend you don’t know. Don’t tell Ye-jin. You know people in the case. I’ll call you later. - But… - Just bring this out. Thanks. (DAD) Hi, dad. Is everything all right? Of course. I’m having dinner with friends. Then I’ll be brief. Dr. Song will do your surgery. I’ll text you his number. Book a date. Thanks, dad. Seok-ho says… Who cares what he says? Let him mind his tiny clinic. Bye for now. Bye. - I’ll do it. - It’s okay. What surgery? It’s nothing. A surgery? For whom? Breast implants. What? No way. Why? Can’t I get breast implants? Remember your lecture at the Ministry of Gender Equality? Remember your lecture at the Ministry of Gender Equality? You said plastic surgery is the worst practice that plays on weak mentality. That was just a lecture. Why didn’t you invite me to it? It was difficult with too many medical terms. It would’ve been boring for you. - This tastes great. - I know. There were mostly career women. And it was in the evening. A housewife should just make dinner. Why is someone else doing the surgery? Well… Her dad said that I couldn’t. He got the best plastic surgeon in Korea to do her surgery. He got the best plastic surgeon in Korea to do her surgery. Not a lousy doctor like me who does two for the price of one. - Please… -Why? It’s true. Her father doesn’t recognize me as a doctor nor his son-in-law. Stop it. It’s not like you. What’s like me? How about this? That top surgeon and you work on one breast each. That top surgeon and you work on one breast each. - The hell? - Then Ye-jin asks her dad later which one looks better. - That’s retarded! - He must be drunk. That’s the best thing you've said all night! - Right? - Shut up! How can the husband give his wife breast implants? - Why not? - It makes no sense. He won’t be sexually attracted to her anymore. It’s true. Ye-jin is right. I think so, too. If he’s depressed, he can’t get treated by her. It’d be more like an interrogation. Even if he had problems, he would never see a psychiatrist. Even if he had problems, he would never see a psychiatrist. He thinks it’s a waste of time and money. What do you mean? You look down on psychiatry. You think I just listen and make easy money. So you said plastic surgery is the worst medical practice? So you said plastic surgery is the worst medical practice? Ye-jin. We’re doing the same thing. We’re both treating people’s chests. You examine the inside, while I examine the outside. But you can touch to check the results. - Boo! - Geez! Don’t scare me! - Is it mine? - Whose is it? It’s not us. It’s an alarm. The steamed red crab is ready. I’ll clean up. Young-bae? Let’s go out and see the eclipse. - Why? - Let’s go grab a smoke. - I don’t want to. - Let’s go. Let’s get some fresh air. Use the ashtray there. Didn’t you quit? Let’s see the eclipse. We can’t see from here! What’s with you? We can see! The moon’s right there. Just smoke. You’re acting weird. What do you want? - Young-bae. - Yeah? - Help me out. - Why? Well… I met this woman. You what? Woman? Quiet! Shit! This is serious! Keep it quiet! Holy shit! Who is she? It’s not what you think. We met casually. But she sends me pictures at 10 p.m. every night. - What pictures? - Of her! You’re screwed. I never asked you for help before. Please help me out this once? How can I help you? You and I have the same phones. Let’s switch them. - No way, man! - Wait! - Just until the picture comes. - So I can look stupid? - You’re still single. - No! - I have a sick girlfriend. - But she’s not here! Then why agree to this game? Everyone said they’ll play. I couldn’t say no! It would look suspicious. Forget it. I don't want to get involved. How can you say that to me? Want me to get in trouble for some stupid pictures? Fine. Forget it, bastard. I’ll just get divorced. Soon-dae, you, and I can start a divorced men’s club! Soon-dae, you, and I can start a divorced men’s club! After I secretly covered your bastard when you couldn’t pay the alimony… - Bastard. - What kind of pictures? Just normal pictures. Like pics of her wearing Hello Kitty pajamas. - What? - The white kitty with a ribbon on her head? - How old? - The kitty? The woman, stupid! 12-year difference. A 33-year-old wearing Hello Kitty? - Fifty-seven. - What? Are you out of your mind? But she’s nice like an older sister. Help me out, man. Wait a second. She’s 57 and wears Hello Kitty? - Please? - Let me think. Come on! I’ll clear the table. - Sorry. - It’s okay. The young bitch acts so smart. I wanted to show her that I lecture at places like that. I told her to come to scare her. Why bring that up? Is she naive or stupid? She’s cunning. Watch it. She’s doing that on purpose to split us up. Or why else bring it up? It’s because she wants to be close to you, but you only like me! How dare she try to get between us. What conspiracy were you plotting out there? Just watching the eclipse. Ye-jin? Seok-ho is seeing a psychiatrist. What? He said it’s a secret, but I thought you should know. Pretend you don’t know. That’s my phone. (Kim So-wol) - Kim So-wol? - Who? - The poet. - Didn’t he pass away? A call from the dead? Is it Mother? Who’s Kim So-wol? Nickname of a friend from poetry class. - Did you drink? - No. Hello? It’s me. Hi. How about a walk in the park with the kids? - I’m at a friend’s housewarming. - Really? Your rich friends with the new house? I’ll call you later. Is Ms. Perfect on her high horse showing off her new house? Is Ms. Perfect on her high horse showing off her new house? Bragging about her luxury goods? - Baby. - No... You said she’s annoying. Why’d you go there? That’s not the house I’m at! Really? Not the ones who got pregnant early and started off in a shabby rental? - No! - Did you make them cake? - Want some crab? - Yes. Stop making her stuff. Hello? Are you there? Turn it off! Hurry! Turn it off! It’s all wet. Sorry. The blow dryer is in the bathroom. Thanks. Man… It’s not you. Someone else bought a house. It’s house buying season. I went to 4 housewarmings this month. Really? Of course it’s me. Saying I’m annoying, means I’m pretty, right? Right. Don’t associate with ignorant people like that! - Forget it. - Let’s eat. - Let’s eat the crab. - Sure. It’s mine. Yes! Golf next Saturday is confirmed. Why tee off so early? It was so hard to even get that booking. I got the message, too. We’re golfing next week? Yes. He’s coming, too. You’ll get the text. You left me out? No way, man. Practice for it. Then why didn’t I get the message? Turn it off, then on again. Text messages can get lost if they’re sent out at once. Text messages can get lost if they’re sent out at once. How can you leave a friend out like that? We didn’t! Of course not! What’s the date next Saturday? The 17th. I forgot. I have lunch with the opposition that day. A lawyer having lunch with the opposition? Aren’t we going to your mom’s that day? Cut the act, man. It’s true. I have to check on her dog. - Then let’s cancel. - Sure. We’re cancelling. We can’t go anyway. But I didn’t get the text. Then we’ll cancel after you get it. The fee won’t be much. Then we’ll cancel after you get it. The fee won’t be much. Cancel it now. Who is it? (PLEASE CALL! IT’S URGENT!! - CHAE-YOUNG) It’s Chae-young. “Please call. It’s urgent.” With 3 exclamation marks. Who’s Chae-young? His restaurant’s manager. It’s not what you think. Must be a bad customer demanding to see the owner. It happens. Weird folks do that to try and get a free meal. You believe everything he says? You seem so naïve at times. Stop it. Honey? Why don’t you call Chae-young? - Now? - Why not? It could be important. Fine, then. Let him off the hook this once? He got yelled at enough here. I don’t want him to go. He got yelled at enough here. I don’t want him to go. - Why you! - Whatever! Chae-young is not his type. She’s tall and wears heavy makeup. And she has big breasts. He doesn’t like women with big breasts. - Really? - What’s her last name? - What if I did her breasts? - Could be. He doesn’t like big breasts. She’s got it all wrong! - No! You don’t like big breasts. - Right! It’s mine. Where are you going? To work out. What’s with him? What are you doing? What’s with you? Dang. My shoulders are stiff. You have to take care of it. It’s a training app for building muscles. Shouldn’t you reduce your muscles? You should finish eating first. When the alarm rings, I have to do it. - Even at night? - Yup. But I don’t do it in front of Min-seo. Shouldn’t you do it on top of her? Crazy jerk! Geeze! Are you okay? Here’s a napkin! Don’t fart, man! Did he shit his pants? 6 a.m. on the 17th. - Is your phone okay? - Yes. Spider push-ups. This strengthens the pectoralis major and the abdomen. This strengthens the pectoralis major and the abdomen. He’s your friend! He practice swings 7 times at tee! Groups behind us hate it! He’s so competitive. He’s got no manners in sports. If he loses a ball, he’ll take all day until he finds it. He drives us crazy! The finishing move! Skater hops! Seeing the news on lost corpses in the woods, - he comes to mind. - Why? He’d find it right away. Can’t afford to go to a gym? Of course I can. I just don’t like it there. People hog the machines. For hours! Sports are about manners. See? Sports are about manners. - Why didn’t you tell me? - About what? You getting therapy. Oh that… It hasn’t been long. How long? Since last September… so it’s been about 6 months. That’s long. Are you mad? Yes, I am. You said you didn’t want it. Now, I do. Why? I want to try what I can. If we… get divorced… I’d like to say that at least I tried. Is it helping? Not sure. What do you think? You’re the expert. I’ve learned one thing for sure. Relationships should begin with accepting that we’re all different. People are all different. They think and act differently. People are all different. They think and act differently. Even in expressing love. But we say that it’s wrong and hurt each other. Who’s your psychiatrist? He’s better than me. You said if I did your breast surgery, I won’t be sexually attracted to you. I didn’t know that you were trying to save our relationship, too. I’m sorry. But Ye-jin, you’re still attractive and beautiful. Like when we first met at 20. And I’m an expert on breasts. Yours are the best I’ve ever seen. You smiled! Let’s not become Barbie and Ken. They’re filled with silicon and have no genitals, you know? They’re filled with silicon and have no genitals, you know? I feel much better after changing clothes. Let’s go. He was the top fist in town. We had it easy in high school thanks to him. Stop bringing up the past. What was my baby like? Curious? It’ll cost you. Jun-mo? He had so much love! He always had 12 women by his side. Ah-jung, Sung-yoon… - Mi-sun… - Hey! I didn’t date her! - Yes, you did! - Today’s highlight! Snailfish soup! Snailfish soup! Wow, it's game over. It’s delicious! It’s good! This is amazing! It’s a Telegram. What? Telegram. Right. I use Telegram. Let’s see. Someone sent me a picture. It came? A picture? Why? Young-bae received a picture. Someone I know keeps sending me pictures. What pictures? I’m downloading… - Jesus! - Hey! You’ll break it! - What’s with you? - What’s wrong? It’s nothing. What’s the picture of? Nothing. Let’s see. What is it, man? Give it to me. Wait! Grab his hand! Got a hammer here? Fine! Look at it. What? It’s cracked! Who cares? It’s my phone. Still? It’s okay to get broken? That costs a lot! What is it? An expert should see this. What is it? These are natural. Probably a D cup. What? Don’t look at it, ladies. D cup? - Min-seo? - My girlfriend isn’t that vulgar. It can’t be a 45 year-old’s body. Who is this? - It says ‘Star’ here. - See? Young-bae has a girlfriend and a ‘Star’? No moon? Young-bae! You’re the man! Hurray Star! A text for you! Who’s got the cute alarm? - Whose is it? - Yours. Right. It’s mine. What’s that sound? You changed it? The kids must’ve. “Are you still mad?” That’s it. “From Min-su” Who’s Min-su? My office manager. Park Min-su. Why would he ask you if you’re mad? Stop asking so many questions! Things happen. Give me some snailfish soup! Try it with rice. Aren't you going to reply? Do I have to? I don’t get people who read the message and don’t reply. The sender can see the message has been read. They’ll be waiting for a reply. - And he’s worried why you’re mad. - Right. Then just reply, “It’s okay.” Is that so hard? Ah, I guess it’s not. So, "It's okay?" No. That sounds weird. It sounds like you’re still mad. Say that you’re having dinner with friends and you’ll call later? - No. - She’s right! That sounds better. No need to say where you’re at! Why say that? Just answer the question. Some weird people say too much! Just answer the question. Some weird people say too much! - You’re weird. - Look. Why tell what you’re doing with whom and everything? Then what should I do? Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter! Damn SNL! SNS! (Social media) They pull out their phones, take pictures of everything, - and beg to be seen! - He's spitting everywhere. Gross. What nice place you’re at and eating what with whom? What nice place you’re at and eating what with whom? I don’t care at all! Get it? Right. I won’t reply. Fine! Don’t! You got a call. It’s an unknown caller. Answer it. I won’t. Hello? Hello. Is this Mr. Jeong Seok-ho? Yes. Who’s calling? It’s Detective Kang from the Sokcho Police. I’m calling about your loss in the pre-construction scam here. Hello? Hello? Mr. Jeong? Are you there? It’s voice phishing. Really? He said he’s a cop. They always say they’re from a government office. I got a call saying it’s the prosecutor's office. I got one from the post office. I got one saying it’s the National Tax Office. Block the caller. - Good idea. - Ok - I got a text. - Wait! I’ll read it. What now? - Do you guys know this? - What? Hi Bixby! Read the message. I think you're bipolar. Your voice won’t work. You’re right. You try it. What’s with him? Hi Bixby. Read the message. New message. Hello Ms. Hwang Su-hyeon. Your requested package is available in May. - Can mine do that? - Of course. Please refer to our website for more details. Silver Nursing Home, where your parents are like ours. Silver Nursing Home, where your parents are like ours. Why send a text at this hour? Was that about a nursing home? - Honey. I can explain. - Hey. - Are you crazy? - Tae-su! Hold on. Please let me explain. Listen to her. Calm down. Let her explain. I went there with a close friend. Who? Kim So-wol. Her real name is Park Dong-sook. Her mother is staying there. I went along for fun, but it was really nice. I toured and asked for more information. - That’s all. - It’s like going to a funeral home and booking the next room. That’s not it, honey. You’re trying to chase my mom out? What do you mean chase her out? Don’t point fingers at something I didn’t even do. What did mom ever do to you? She cooks, cleans, and watches the kids! I know, and I’m always thankful. But honestly… Ever since she came, things changed between us. That’s what this is? Mom sleeping downstairs affected our love life, is that it? Mom sleeping downstairs affected our love life, is that it? That’s what you mean? - Tae-su, stop. - Hold on. My mom never comes upstairs. How can you say that? I shouldn’t have said that. Everything’s fine between us. I shouldn’t have said that. Everything’s fine between us. Damn… Can you live with her mom? Ye-jin. She has her husband, but my mom is alone. All her friends are down south. She’s alone in Seoul. You’re right. But living together can make you go crazy. Who lives with their in-laws these days? And your mom has quite a temper. Right. I got hit by your mom more than my own dad. You need more beatings from my mom, pal. Let’s stop playing this game! It sucks. We're here for a party! Why are we all fighting? Yeah. Let’s stop the game. How about going out to see the lunar eclipse? - Yes! - Let’s go! - Let’s get some air. - Come out. - Let’s go. - Okay. Let’s get some air. - Let me see! - Look! It’s 70% covered now. When it’s fully covered, it turns red. Blood moon. - Su-hyeon? - Yes? You’re prettier. It’ll go back to normal soon. I’m sorry. I didn' think things through. Forget it. Stop crying in front of people. Why aren’t you eating? Let’s take a picture. - Good idea. - Sure! Let’s take it. Gather around! - Let’s take one together. - I’ll take it. - I’ll take it. - Really? There. Is everyone in? Everybody smile! One, two! (SE-KYUNG HELP ME. - YEON-WOO) Help with what? I don’t know. Who’s Yeon-woo? Nobody. Hurry! - Why save his name as Yeon-woo? - It’s his name. No last name? It seems like you're really close. Who is it? Why’s Jun-mo mad? He’s my ex-boyfriend. You still keep in touch? Just block his number. - Take the picture! It’s cold. - Let’s go back in. - Fine. - Smile! Ready? (CAN’T GET AN ERECTION -YEON-WOO) Damn son of a bitch! Wait! Calm down! It said he can’t get an erection! Let me explain! - Maybe he typed wrong. - Or it’s auto-spelling. Shut the hell up! Honey! - Jun-mo! - Listen! Let’s change phones now. We can’t! You cracked my phone! And why get so mad over replying to the text? When can we change it? Later. Let’s go in. Explain yourself! Yeon-woo has a dog named Albert. An english mastiff with a registered pedigree. He must’ve called because he’s having trouble breeding it. He must’ve called because he’s having trouble breeding it. Why’s he asking you? I’m a veterinarian! You’re not the only one! Why does he have to ask you? I know Albert the best. I took care of him since he was a puppy. Fine. Forget it. Don’t believe me? I’ll prove it. Forget it! Come on. The game’s over. Talk about this at home. Come on. The game’s over. Talk about this at home. It’s not over! We’re finishing what we started! We’re not giving up! That’s your problem. You never stick to anything. Why get divorced? Why quit school? That’s why your life is like that, fool! Why bring me into this? Stop giving up halfway no matter how hard it is! Stop giving up halfway no matter how hard it is! What the hell? What the hell? Is he trying to help Young-bae or is he just venting? Is he trying to help Young-bae or is he just venting? Weird. (YEON-WOO) No matter what, I’ll love you forever… Damn. Nice song. Sorry to bother you when you’re busy. I finally found a purebred female. Just help me out once. - Help me? - Yeon-woo. Please don’t call me again. My husband hates it. I’m sorry! Just tell me the massage order. - Lay Albert on his side. - Okay. Here, Albert. He’s down. Start with the testis. Rub them slowly with your thumb and forefinger. - Slowly. - Why are we listening to this? - Quiet. - Start from the outside - Softly. - Don’t! I think it’s working. Why are we listening to a dog getting an erection? Does this work on people, too? Is someone there beside you? No. Don’t worry about that. - What’s wrong? - Damn! Albert bit me! Albert! No! Way to go, Albert. Let’s stop for today. I’ll email you the instructions. - Take care. Bye. - Thanks! All that for a dog... Believe me now? Do you talk often? First time since we got married. I never talk to my ex-girlfriends! Of course not! They wish you were dead. I told him not to call. He won’t do it again. - Block the bastard’s number. - Okay. See? It’s done. Come here. - I’m sorry I yelled. - It’s okay. Now what? Are we still playing the game? We’re resolving misunderstandings. It’s great! He says not to give up. Keep playing. I’m hungry. But we ate so much. How about some ramen to finish off? Rather than working out, stop eating so much. Especially ramen! Fool. - Daddy’s girl is calling. - Tell her to come home quickly. So-young? Enjoyed the movie? Yes. Can we talk for a sec? Sure! I’m listening. You know who I’m with, right? I think so. He’s going for military duty soon, so he wants to go on a trip tonight to see the beach at night. Crazy! If I say no, I think he’ll be sad. What should I do? Don’t go because you think he’ll be sad. Just come back! Don’t go because you think he’ll be sad. Just come back! That’s not your only reason, is it? You’re right. I want to go with him. So-young… Daddy can only say this now. No! Come home now! Daddy can only say this now. No! Come home now! Daddy please… I really like him. Still, not as your dad, but someone who’s been through this before, I want to say this to you. There is a first for everyone. The unforgettable moment is special and cherished. I hope you can look back on it someday and smile. If that time is now, well, then… Go. But if you think you’ll regret it or don’t feel sure, just come home. You can do that. You still have a lot of time left. - Daddy? - Hmm? - Know what? - What? When you gave me the condoms, I was so embarrassed. When you gave me the condoms, I was so embarrassed. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t give it to you for you to use. Then why? You knew and expected something like this would happen. You knew and expected something like this would happen. I think I know how you feel. And I know what to do. If I go away with him, tell mom I’m sleeping at Hyun-a’s. If I go away with him, tell mom I’m sleeping at Hyun-a’s. - Tell her yourself. - What? You should tell her. You know what she’ll do! She won’t listen and just yell at me. When she had me at my age… She won’t accept my feelings for him. It could be because she regrets her choice back at your age. She’s just trying to help you. She loves you very much. She’s just trying to help you. She loves you very much. Don’t get mad, and try to talk to her. You don’t know how hard I’m trying not to get mad. I know it’s not easy, but try. You love her way too much. Of course. You don’t know her like I do. I gotta go. So-young? You did good. Raising kids is hard. I know… Looks like your therapy is working. Bastard! You told everyone? No. You did! I only told Se-kyung. You told me, too. And Young-bae. Sorry. I only told Tae-su. What about you? I thought Ye-jin should know. Man… - Let’s have Tiramisu. - Great idea. - Sorry. - It’s okay. - New message! - It's okay. It happens. It’s Min-su again. He asks why there’s no reply. How annoying. - Then reply to him. He’ll stop. - What? I’m at a friend’s house. Let’s talk tomorrow. There, I sent it. New message! Geeze. “Dickhead”? - What? - The hell? Why is he cursing at you? I can explain. Normally, he’s a great guy, but not when he’s drunk. Normally, he’s a great guy, but not when he’s drunk. He swears and goes crazy! So I’m thinking of firing him. He swears and goes crazy! So I’m thinking of firing him. - A dog, huh? - He is when he’s drunk. - Fire him. - Yeah. It’s him. Answer it and be firm with him. He shouldn’t call you that even if he’s drunk. No use talking to a drunk. Don’t answer it. Right. Good idea. No. Record the call and let him hear it later. Then he’ll know his bad habit can cause big problems. Then he’ll know his bad habit can cause big problems. It’s okay. Answer it. You said you were sick. But you’re with friends? Having fun? You break my heart, then go have fun with other men? You break my heart, then go have fun with other men? What friends? The hell? Do they know that you like men? Will they understand? Have a good life, bastard! Hello? Office manager? He’s totally drunk like I told you. Saying I like men? Shit. What the hell? That’s crazy! What are you all staring at? He’s just drunk. I thought you’d get the wrong idea, so I didn’t say anything. Actually, he’s gay. That’s it. Why didn’t you tell me? Tell you what? He’s just a colleague who’s gay. I told you guys that. Remember? Tell her. He’s just a colleague. And he’s gay. Did you sleep with him? What? Did you do it? Why would I sleep with him? Are you nuts? He’s just an employee! He’s gay so he thinks I’m gay. That’s all! Right. Gay men want all men to be gay. That’s not true. That’s disrespectful. Really? Sorry Tae-su. I didn’t mean to be disrespectful. Why are you apologizing to me? Enough! Did you sleep with manager Min-su or not? Tell me! Su-hyeon! Look at me. We’ve been married for over 15 years! How did we have 3 kids if I like men? Why would I like men? I hate men! Don’t you know me? Well, maybe I don’t know you! I don’t believe this! Help me out here. You guys know me well! Tell her! Su-hyeon! Look at me! Honey! Focus here! Can you imagine me being gay? Can you picture me doing it like this, huh? Don’t get me wrong. I’m just frustrated. I’m straight. Su-hyeon. I swear to you. I didn’t even brush hands with Min-su! You hear me? I swear! So drop it! Stop talking about it. Don’t cry again! Just forget it! New message! It’s Min-su. He says he misses your lips! She’s bleeding! - Let’s see. - Oh no! - Are you okay? Wait! - Go to my room. How do I explain this? Forget it. Don’t say anything. Just shut up. What’s with you, man? What? How can you say that? Sit down. Let’s listen to Tae-su. Listen to him for what? He didn’t tell us for 40 years! Fine. Let’s hear how this happened. Spill it. Who cares? Tae-su is still Tae-su. Nothing’s changed. Shut up, man. You’re all noble and refined, huh? You get that from graduating from a top college? - Jun-mo. - It’s true! You look down on me. If I do anything wrong, you say I’m shallow and stupid. If I do anything wrong, you say I’m shallow and stupid. If Tae-su does something wrong, he has his reasons? If Tae-su does something wrong, he has his reasons? What did I do wrong? If you didn’t think it’s wrong, why didn’t you tell us? If you didn’t think it’s wrong, why didn’t you tell us? Why should I tell you? - Why? - Yeah! How can you say that? We ran around naked at Youngrang Lake when we were little. We lived together in college. We served in the military together! I should know if you’re gay or not! Be honest, man. Are you mad that I didn’t tell you or that I’m gay? Look. Let’s not fight, guys. Stop! You must be open-minded and nice to understand this. You must be open-minded and nice to understand this. Then petty me should just follow you like always. I was wrong, damn it! Happy now? I was wrong to believe we were friends. Don’t drink from the bottle. Tae-su must have his reasons. He was probably just drunk or curious. When guys reach that age, they get bored in life and break away. Still, you can’t do that to your spouse. Man or woman. Enough! The fact is that bastard misses my husband’s lips. How’s your hand? - How long has it been? - What? Since when did you have feelings for men? Is it before you met me? Let’s talk later, okay? How long has it been since we made love? I thought you’re cheating on me, because you keep hiding your phone. Let’s talk about this at home. Why didn’t you meet a woman who shows you breasts like him? Why didn’t you meet a woman who shows you breasts like him? What? Then I’d understand! You understand the breast pics? Shit. How many times did you sleep with him? Is he your only lover? How long has it been! It hasn’t been long! - Let me say something. - No! Let’s go. I’ll explain. Thanks for dinner. Let’s go. Come on! Mother’s not the only one with a new hair-do. Damn it. You're almost frighteningly meticulous but don’t notice me at all. This was the reason why? Stop this! Come on! Aren’t you embarrassed to our kids? Why? What will we tell them? Mom and dad are getting divorced. It’s because dad loves uncle Min-su more than me! It’s because dad loves uncle Min-su more than me! Enough already! I thought we knew each other so well. But you were a stranger. Let’s go home now! What are you doing? - What’s with you! - Get lost! Su-hyeon! - Tae-su. - Wait. It’s your phone. Hello? Why’s it so hard to get a hold of you? About what I asked before, the daily food supply to your restaurant? Hire my brother-in-law? I guarantee the quality. - Fine. I’ll talk to my chef tomorrow. - Thanks! - Let’s have drinks some time. - Sure. Wait! Sorry I missed your wedding. I had a jewelry convention. Sorry I missed your wedding. I had a jewelry convention. But I worked hard on your wedding rings, you know? But I worked hard on your wedding rings, you know? You said your bitchy mother-in-law is very picky. You said your bitchy mother-in-law is very picky. - Okay. Let’s talk later. - Like the earrings? - See ya. - Wait! What earrings? I bought them for your birthday. I don’t wear earrings. My ears aren’t pierced. Of course they’re clip-on earrings. Don’t lie. Everyone’s getting weird and sensitive. Let’s go home now. They’re for the curator, aren’t they? She means nothing to me. We met for work, that’s all. - Are they for Go Eun-hee? - What? She went to school with us. They know her. You know Go Eun-hee, right? Then who did you buy the earrings for! (CHAE-YOUNG) Answer it. - It’s Chae-young. Why? - Go on. It’s about a customer complaint. Se-kyung. Don’t do this. Give me that. Come on! Give me the damn phone! Why weren't you answering my calls, boss? I don’t know what to do! I think I’m pregnant. Two lines means I'm pregnant, right? Are you listening? Sir? Honey? Do you hear me? I'm going crazy. Are you listening? Crazy bastards! Are you okay? Se-kyung! Open up! Se-kyung! Son of a bitch! Honey? What’s wrong? It’s nothing. Why are you crying? I think I made a mistake. Who knew this would happen? It’s okay. I didn’t want to get married. I wanted to run the vet and enjoy life on my own. I wanted to run the vet and enjoy life on my own. I didn’t want to have kids either. I didn’t think I could raise them. I didn’t want to be tied down either. I was so sure of that. Then that bastard came… Get lost! Go away! Su-hyeon! Let’s go! Why? Let’s go home. Go by youself. You want me to make a scene? He’s just a follower of my blog. I don’t know him. Then why is he curious about the color of your underwear? Then why is he curious about the color of your underwear? He’s just a fan of my posts. I've never even met him. He’s just a fan of my posts. I've never even met him. We just exchanged texts. You posted a lot on your blog. It's nothing. Really? It’s all about a woman with 3 kids falling in love with a younger man in his twenties! Call him. What? Call this fan of yours! No! He’s married. So are you. Please… Don’t do this! Hello? Ma’am? Hello? Hi. Sorry for texting you so late at night. It’s okay. I was a bit taken aback. I didn’t think you’d call. I just wanted to hear your voice. Why? You said we can’t call or meet ever. Right. I did. Are you mad I asked about your underwear? - What? - You said you can’t wear pretty lingerie because your husband is conservative. So I said to wear the underwear you want… I’m sorry. The kids are calling. I gotta go. Goodnight. So? What underwear are you wearing? Are you wearing what you want? Huh? What’s with you? What’s with me? What are you wearing? Tell me! You tell a stranger that I’m conservative and such? You tell a stranger that I’m conservative and such? He tells you what underwear to wear? So, what are you wearing under there? - Show me! - Stop it! Make sure you tell the kids what kind of woman you are when we get divorced! Don’t threaten me. See? Like it? What the hell are you doing? Let go! I gotta go this far for you to look at me? Damn. I stayed put where you told me, and thought. The sadder I become, the happier our family will be. So I lived like a slave and maid, and did everything you said. Stop it! But then, my poetry class teacher asked a question. What's your dream? What do you want to become? I thought I heard wrong. That’s a question for kids. So I wrote because I wanted an escape. It may seem crazy, silly, and dirty to you, but I feel so alive inside that world. Wanna know another secret of ours? - Are you out of your mind? - No! I’m telling it! I’m the one who drove! I was drunk and hit the man. But he turned himself in. Terrified of going to prison, I just drove home. If I got arrested for drunk driving, who’d watch our kids? If I got arrested for drunk driving, who’d watch our kids? Tae-su took the blame. You sacrificed yourself for me, and I for our family. You sacrificed yourself for me, and I for our family. That’s what we chose, right? Cut it out. Why? You haven't come near me after that day. The only thing keeping us together is my sense of guilt towards you. I should’ve turned myself in. Thinking of the guilt I felt towards you for a year… Thinking of the guilt I felt towards you for a year… We submerged ourselves in love, and raced to see who’d last longer. You forfeited and left to play another game, but I’m still submerged there. Do you… even love me? Why’d you say you forgive me? You didn’t at all. And you’re suffocating me. People should learn to part, too. If you told me you’re gay, it would’ve been easier. I’m the one who’s gay. If I like men, I’m gay, right? But you talk as if I’m some kind of freak. Gay men and perverts are definitely different. Right? Am I a pervert? Here. Why didn’t you tell us? If Tae-su didn’t… I didn’t know either. I just realized one day. I know why Young-bae didn’t tell us. Wanna know? I was gay for 2 hours tonight. It sucked. We’re all good friends, right? We have a gay friend now. Seok-ho? Jun-mo? How about you? Shut up. That’s why I got divorced. And fired from school. I thought you quit. You got fired? - Sue the school! - What? Sue the school? I couldn’t tell my life-long friends that I’m gay. Sue the school and tell the world? Even if I win in court, I’ll lose out. No matter what the judge says, nothing changes. No matter what the judge says, nothing changes. No one will try to understand me. Not even my mother. This game of truth is fun. It’s thrilling like catching a serial killer! Hey, Jun-mo! I wanted to tell you guys, just not like this. But I think you guys have to tell the truth tonight. I’m leaving. Introduce us to Min-su, pal. No. Human nature is like an eclipse. You can hide it, but it’ll get revealed. If Min-su came here, you would’ve treated him well. If Min-su came here, you would’ve treated him well. Put on an act, you know? Like you always do. But eventually, he would’ve been hurt by your looks. I don’t want him to get hurt. I’ll protect the one I love. Well, at least from this or from you guys. Hey. The young man in Su-hyeon’s poems, it’s you back in college, idiot! Min-su is a fan, too. Take care, man. Se-kyung? Se-kyung! She’s in here. - Se-kyung? Open up! - Se-kyung?
