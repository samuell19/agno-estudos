(somber music) - [Shoemie Voiceover] Nugi's funeral was unusual. Many people attended the wake, but his personal crew did the burial secretly. Since Bazil, Hamid, Joshu, and I grew up with Nugi, we wanted to be present till the end. (somber music) - I'm really gonna miss you, Nugi. - Unfortunately, Nugi wasn't alive. The dollars come quick, but the death rate is just so high. - [Shoemie Voiceover] Nugi's personal crew vanished from the scene. Never to be seen again. - I remember when we was youngsters and those food stamps came out his pocket. After that, he always said he's gonna be the man with all the money. - [Shoemie Voiceover] I was barely a teen without a worry in the world. The homies would always hang on Saturdays for neighborhood ball. - Shoemie, you ain't about to get no more touchdowns. Matter of fact, you ain't even got to get the pass off. - Yeah, all right then. We'll see about all that. This is for game, this is for game. - What's that supposed to mean? Now you definitely ain't scoring, Nugi. - Hamid, don't even worry about it, foo'. - That's tellin' 'em, Joshu. - Man, shut up, Dante! - Yeah, tell 'em. - You scared or something? Let's do this. - Yeah, let's do this. Hey Bazil, this is for you, this is for you. - Let's do this. Ready, set, go! - Go Nugi! (boys laughing) - Hey don't worry, boy, we can't tell no one where's your receipts. (boys laughing) (upbeat hip hop music) - [Shoemie Voiceover] The girlies. Nugi's main squeeze, Deneena, in the middle. As years went on, we all grew differently. Nugi was at another level. Nugi was big time now. He ran a small strip joint. It was his cover-up for the dope game that he was involved in. - Anybody want to fuck with white in this town, they gotta fuck with me, you know what I'm saying? - That's what I'm saying. - Yeah. - What's a dope dealer with no dope, tell me. - [All] Nothing. - Nothing. - That's right. - All right, motherfuckers. - I don't let that stop me. (men chattering) - Fuck this shit, man. Let's just do this, man. - It's gonna work, man. - Aye, y'all chill. (knocking on door) It's that time, man. - Niggas better hurry up. - Just chill, man. (light rhythmic music) - [Shoemie Voiceover] Bobo and his boys. They were the hit men of the city and they were the best. When it came down to guns, he was a supplier. Bobo and Nugi were real close, they spent youth time together in CYA, which is a jail facility in Northern California. Bobo was also from Oakland, the east side. That's why him and Nugi were so close. Common territory. - Whatever you want to call it. I cornered the market. I was the dope dealer to the motherfucking dope village, you know what I'm saying straight to your face? - I know it. - Making more profit than anybody. - Hey man, look like Bobo here. - Come on, man. - Let me know what Bobo says. - Mm-hm. - Hey girl. Yeah, bring it on over here. God damn, it's on now, boy. Hey. - [Man] Don't trip. - Hey, what's up, Nugi? - Hey, what's up, man? - All right, cut. - What's up, man? - How you doin', man? - All right. - What's goin' on, baby? - All right. - What's up? - You got that skill I need, baby? - Yeah, I got all that, man. - Ah yeah, no lyin'. - Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' bout right there. - God damn.

Yeah I guess it's your lucky motherfucking day, 'cause here come the motherfuckers right now. - [Bobo] They coming through right now! Man, we on that way right now. - Bad move, man. - Man.

(gunshots firing) (tense music) (man laughing) (intense music) - [Radio DJ] I'm Debonair. Good morning Oakland and Bay area. Got something new for you. You're tuned into KMOB 90.7. It's 15 minutes after the hour of 7:00 AM, and now back to more K-Mob music. (intense music) - Mm, what up, Oak town? Man, it feels good to be turning back to my roots. Thought I'd never make it back to this place. (rhythmic music) - [Announcer] Good morning, from KDEB TV3. This is the award winning AM Oakland morning news. - [Sherri] Good morning, I'm Sherri Gonzales. Oakland Police investigators are still searching for at least two gunmen who's sprayed an East Oakland house with bullets just before dawn this morning. The home is on Birch Street near 82nd avenue. Oakland Police would not release the name of the owners, but they just say he is a suspected drug dealer. Witnesses say that they heard a car screech to a hault outside the home this morning. - What the hell has happened to Oakland? - [Shoemie Voiceover] My father taught me how to be a man. That's why it's been 11 years since I've been home. The death of my mother reunited my father and me. I didn't want to lose him without letting him know how much I admire him, because it's not about reaching out over the phone, rather than one's physical presence. - Woo, it's a jungle out there. I know better than that. Oakland can be a positive city. - Hey, what's up, Pop? - Hey! Boy, you still got your key, huh? - Aw man. It's good to see you, man. - Look at you, boy, you look good. - Yeah. - You done put a little weight there too, huh? - You know it. You ain't looking bad yourself. Man, you sure you're sick? Or is that just your way of getting me to come back home? - Well, I wish my heart wouldn't bother me. It got so bad I had to retire from the construction business. It was just too stressful. Oh boy, I wish your mother was here to see you, boy. She would be so proud of you. - Yeah, I know, Pop. Well yo, mom is in my heart, and she will always be with me in spirit. - Yeah, you right son. Hey, let's help unpack your book bag and get you settled in, boy. - Sounds good. That sounds good. - I got up thousand things to update you on, boy. - Oh yeah? - Oakland done changed a lot since you been up there in Washington. And the employment situation around here stinks. Boy, be glad you had a boss who could hook you up with a job the way he did. - Yeah? - Must pay pretty decent too, huh? - We you know the superviser. He the one that got me the job. - Yeah. - He's a pretty cool white guy. - All white people ain't evil, son. Just a few of them. - I know, I know. - Hey, a couple of your buddies always stopping by here to visit with me since you've been gone. - Who's that, Pops? - Oh, that boy on crutches. What's that boy name? Joshua! - Joshu, okay. - Joshua, yeah! He always bring me some of that music he producing. And also your other friend, Habit, Hamid. - Hamid, Hamid, yeah. - Hamid, yeah. Did you know that boy with the police force now? - Wait a minute, Hamid's a cop? - Yeah. - What about Nugi? - Eh, I don't know about that boy, son. I think he's into drugs. - Oh no. - Well you watch yourself around him. He's what I call a, a consequence. You are hard working young man with a good mind. You can go places, son. Think so, Pop? - Yeah! - Thanks, man. - Say, what happened to that old girl you been having? - Hey. Hate to say it, but we broke up, man. - Oh, well. Life rolls on. (men laughing) My boy, come here, boy. - Looking good, man. - Yeah! (serene music) - [Shoemie Voiceover] Man, she was gorgeous. And she smiled at me, it's on now. - Shoemie, what are you doing here? - Ofelia, how you doing? What's going on? - What are you doing here? You picking up food for tonight? - Yeah, didn't I tell you last night I was gonna pick up something for the kids? - Oh, you're right, I'm sorry. I'll see you in a couple hours. - Okay, I'll see you. - Pork isn't good for you. - Were you talking to me? Excuse me, miss. - That new man, huh? - Were you talking to me back there? - Yes, I was. Hi, I'm Imani, what's your name? - My name is Shoemie. It's a pleasure to meet you, Imani. I'm surprised a gorgeous young lady like yourself would take interest in what I'm eating. Pretty nice of you. Do you stay around here? - You need a sack? - No man, I'm cool. - Actually, I go to school around here. I'm a full time student at the University. - That's good. I graduated from University of Washington four years ago and I have a degree in sociology. - Well this fall's gonna be my last year. - Is it? - Yeah, I can't wait. It's good to run into a brother who's educated. - Is that right? - So, are you on your way home to. - [Shoemie Voiceover] Imani had nice conversation, and she was gorgeous. - Excuse me ma'am, that's five dollars. - [Shoemie Voiceover] In the back of my mind, I felt her attracted to me. - Well um, I gotta go. Myself, I'm on my way to a meeting right now. It's really nice talking to you. - All right, you take care now. - Have a nice day. - Drive safe. - Thank you. What's up, man? - How's it going, man? - You know, I respect a man who can take care of himself. - Well, you know, Imani, you're more than welcome to come over for dinner. I'm a pretty fair cook. - Sounds tempting, but I can't tonight. I'll tell you what, though. I'll give you my phone number, maybe we can get together sometime. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. You mean you don't have a boyfriend? - Well, I broke up with my ex about a year ago. So I consider myself available. - Okay. - I'm not into games, though. But you seem as serious as you are nice. So, why don't you call me when you have some free time? I gotta get going now. I'm late for a meeting. - Well Imani, you to take it easy and I'll see you around, okay? - [Shoemie Voiceover] Haven't seen my homies from the old hood since I went away to the University of Washington on an athletic scholarship. So I was more than curious to see what they all were up to, because time definitely brings on change. Joshu and I had a common bond between us. We both lost one parent and understood each other's pain. We shared empathy for one another. - All right, man. - Man, what's going on, man? - Oh man, good. - I'm cool. - Good to see you, man. - Come on, now. - Yeah, surprise though. - Yeah. - What's up, man? You over here starting your business. - Oh man, still trying to get settled in, man. You know, it's kinda harsh starting out from scratch. All I have right now is my furniture, man. - Oh shit, man. You know how it is. Making it good just takes a little time, that's all. - I guess you right, man. So, what's up, man? Are you gonna say I never seen ya. - I ain't say nothing, man. - We're tight, man. - You know Joshu always did respect your vision and your vibe, man. Someday you're gonna become, you're gonna win an American Music Award. - Oh yeah, you know that? - But tell me something, Joshu, you ever get frustrated? - And you know I do, man. - Yeah. - Sometimes get upset, you know, my nigga I fall with the most, you know what I'm saying? The car wreck done really fucked me up, man. It still does. - Yeah. - But you know what? That music is like my father. God and his trials, you know what I'm saying? - Uh-huh. - So how's your pop doing, man? - Well you know, Pops is getting on my case man, about being better himself. And telling me I should be making my mom proud. Speaking of which, I met this lovely lady today, man. - I feel you something, man. I always go the death of our parents, that's what always kept us strong, you know what I'm saying? - Right. - So when's the last time you ever seen your boy, Nugi? - Aw man, I haven't seen Nugi in a while, man. How about you? Have you seen him lately? - It's been a while, man. I hear he's the man, man. You know what I'm saying? - That's too bad. - I always thought, what'd it'd be like for the boys to get back together again, you know? - Yeah, just like the good old times. - Yeah, old times sake. 'Cause who'd ever thought that Hamid would become a cop? - Yeah, that's the last thing. - Bazil a construction worker. Nugi, the deed man. - Damn. - Myself, a struggling ass producer. - Naw man. - And you Shoemie, psychologist. Healer of all minds. - I don't know about all that man. Man, thanks for the promotion, but I'm far from being a psychologist, man. - I don't think so, man. You're the only person that I know that helps and listens. Most people just talk, you know what I'm saying? You also played a mean game of football back in the day, too. - I did. But let me give you a few compliments, man. - Go on. - You know, just before your accident, man, you was one hell of a football player yourself. But tell you what man, you one hell of a producer. This music of yours' kicking. - It's delirious, right? You know, when I was in high school, man, I was on this damn cane. So I'm a take a bow, you know what I'm saying? - [Shoemie] Right, I understand that. - Oh, lit. You know, you are definitely lucky. If I was a man like you. (knocking on door) - Joshu, what's up, man? We going or what, man? You know what I'm saying, man. Hey, I know you, man. - [Shoemie] Hey, what's going on, man. How you doing? - Yeah. You with the University of Washington. - Right, I did. - Yeah, you's a slot back. I saw you in the Rose Bowl. - Uh-huh. - Yeah, you was raw. Aye, aye didn't you go pro? - I did. I played up at, I played up in Canada for two years. - You did? - With the Eskimos. So, you know, now that's it. - That's good, man. You was raw, man. I remember you. - Now this year, I think that we should really get involved and do something positive in the community. You know, something that has a real impact. You know, something positive. Does anybody have any suggestions? - What about something dealing with high school students? - Okay, good idea. - What about a learning center for African history. - Good idea. What else? - Hey Ash, well what about the homeless? - [Shoemie] Imani Epsilon Phi Psi Sorority at the University College. The ladies represented community involvement and positive leadership among black women. - Come on ladies. We're gonna go by a process of elimination here. So we need to get as many ideas up on the board as we possibly can. We need to get as many ideas up here on the board as we can so that we can eliminate them down to just one that we can all agree upon. And if we don't get participation from everybody, then we're just gonna have to go with what we have. It seems as if only the senior sorors are participating. - She's cute when she's demanding. - I see. (women laughing) - Well what about afterschool programs? - Good idea. Good. - You know, I really like that suggestion Val made. Being from Oakland myself, I think we should do something like an afterschool program. In fact, I got a little brother who's involved with the East Oakland Boys and Girls club, and he was telling me that his basketball program is about to be cut. Uh-huh, because there's not enough money. If programs like this get cut, then the kids involved have no alternatives, which I believe in itself would lead to drugs and crime. - That's true. - That's true. - You know, that's true. I can really relate to that. - You know, actually I think that's a really good idea. I say that we can take a vote on that right now. Good, so it's confirmed. Afterschool programs it is. - Hey Bella, won't you go give me something to drink, all right? - Okay, be right back. - Excuse yourself. - Come here, doll. Speak. Yeah, you like that, don't you? Give me a little sugar, say bout that. - How you ladies enjoying the party? - Oh, we're enjoying it. - That's good, that's good. Check this out, I got some VSOP in the house if you ladies down. - Sounds good to me. - Good to me. - That's good, after you. All right. - Bobo, hey Bobo, how you doing? - Hey, what's up Gigi? What's this about? What's going on, huh? Check this out, I want y'all to come strip from my brother. He supposed to come home up out the penitentiary. - Okay. - And I want y'all to come strip. - Okay, (indistinct). - Okay, you down? - I'm down. - Okay, here y'all get y'all something real freaky like, you know? - All right. - Yeah, get y'all something. Real sexy like, all right? - Okay. - Y'all gonna do your thing? - Of course. - Okay. - Don't we always? - All right. - Okay. - Sit down. - Hey bro. - Hey, what's up, dude? - My man right here. - Oh yeah? It's Antonio Feliz. - How you doing, dude? Yeah, I seen you nice and comfortable in my favorite chair a little while ago. - Well, it's the best. - Who's that you got with you there? - Ah, this is. - Lucy. - Lucy? How you doing, Lucy? You look good. What's up, G? - Yeah, we talked about, man, we got, he gonna give us 10 G's long as he gets 50 down. - 50? Can you guarantee me that same processing and packaging as always? - Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. - That sounds tight. It's your world, man. All right. Okay. - Well, goodnight baby. Ready when you are. - Okay man. Go get yourself a dream, man. - All right. - It's all good. - All right. - Say dude, hey man. You think we can trust these motherfuckers? I trust your judgment man, but I don't like white people, man. - I did my homework, man. - Did you? - I did mine. It's all good. - All right, man. Tight, man. Say man, relax man. You handled your business, man. We gonna get you that house in The Bahamas you always wanted, all right? - You know that's right. - Okay, dude. I'll see you, man. - All right. - All right. Come here, dog. Come here, come here. - [Shoemie] Nugi occasionally would have private parties for his people that work for him. - Yo man, that's right, man. I heard Shoemie's back in town. - No shit? You heard Shoemie's back in town? - Yeah man. - Aw man. That's my homie, man. I love him. I always knew that motherfucker was gonna come back to the Oak. But when he do catch up with us, he'll be surprised to see how we run this undergrad around here, it's tight, shit. - Man, Shoemie's back? Oh now that's a special man, right there. - Oh here she comes. - Even back in high school. He had his head together. He always had his head together. - Yeah. - Remember, Nugi? - You right about that. - One, two, three, four, five. (phone ringing) - Hello? Oh hi, Shoemie. How are you doing? I'm glad you called. Oh no, that's just my sorority sisters. We're just wrapping up a meeting. (people chattering) - Bye, Molly. - Bye. - Hey, I was wondering if, you want to go to the movies or something. Maybe we can go down to Fisherman's Wharf of something like that. How's that sound? - Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. - [Woman] Imani, call me. - Uh-huh. Okay. Well yeah, I am a little bit tired. Okay. Okay. Well I'd definitely like to get to know you better. Okay, Sunday. Sounds good. Goodnight to you, too. Bye. - Yeah. (lively music) - [Shoemie Voiceover] Imani and I hit it off big. We had so much in common and we shared many interests. My degree in psychology had paid off. I was managing director of a group home of six kids in Oakland, California. I was able to set this up through my former college, University of Washington, graduate program. - It's too bad to see Oakland don't have the Raiders, man. - Yeah, they never should have left, man. Never should have left. - Good morning, Stan. - Good morning. - I'm starving like Marvin. - Hey, fella, how you doing? - Get in there. - Sup my negros. - Hey, there he is. - What's up, white boy? - What's up. - Good morning, Sophia, my angel. - [Sophia] Why don't you take your hat off, Stan. - May I enter? - Yes you may, Alton. - [Counselor] Hey, no skating in the hallway, today. - Why? - Tomorrow maybe. Not today. Come on, let's go in for breakfast. - Where's Sherman and Jake? - Oh they upstairs. I don't think they want to go to Marine World. - Is that right? Tell you what, I'm gonna go upstairs and I'm gonna go get them. - I'm going to eat. - Let's go. - Good morning, may I enter. - You sure can, after you put your skateboard away. - Morning. - Hey Jim, where's Sherman and Jake? - [Jim] Oh, Shoemie went upstairs to get them. They'll be down in a minute. - Man, I don't want to go to no dang Marine World. - Let's do something stupid so we won't be able to go. - Hey, I heard that. Looks like we need an attitude adjustment here. No matter what you say, you're going to Marine World. If you want to bring attitude with you, just have to face the consequences as soon as you get back. - But that's no fair, Marine World's boring. - Regardless of what you say, you're going to Marine World. And you'll have a good time. - But Marine World's for kids and punks. - Oh, okay. Is that right? Sherman, have you ever been to Marine World? - No. - How bout you, Jake? Well then, how can you judge Marine World, or anything else for that matter, if you've never been there? The bottom line is that it's educational. And I think you guys will learn a thing or two about animals. Now, regardless of how you feel, the fact that Marine World's on our agenda today, you're going. Now let's go downstairs and have breakfast and try to have a productive day. Are you fellas down with that? - [Both] Yes. - All right, give me a high five. Let's go do this. Let's go. - [Shoemie Voiceover] Incredible. All the homies from the old school, we all hooked up at Bazil's house. - Where you get this from? - Perfect USDA choice. - Technology. - What's up, man? You all squared for some minutes, man? (men chattering) - You smoke weed, you always be tripping. - No no, you the man. - Check it out, check it out, check it out. Classic football stories. - Aw shit, here we go again. - Remember the time when Shoemie dropped the touchdown pass. (men chattering) The fourth quarter of the city game. - Yeah, but who won the game? - Well let me finish, man. - Say man, let's not forget. What did we hold them to, what? Seven points or something that game? (men chattering) - That's right. The new school, you know what I'm saying. - I don't think you'll ever let us forget that. - Yeah yeah. - We know. - You know we shocked everybody with that. I don't think anybody expected us to pull that off. - No. - Everybody got off, everybody got off. Although Shoemie, you did drop the touchdown pass. - You play too much, man. - You were all state, but if you held on to the rock you'd be All-American. - Yeah, but that's why I went pro, fool. - I'm telling you. - Caught my ass. - Yeah. - Say man. - Keep talking that smack, man. I'm bout to leave you here. - Give me that. - Man, come on. - Give me that. - God damn. - Aye yo, y'all think there was gonna be some women at this party, man? And more importantly, you won't let me spring my case. (men chattering) - That makes me wish two things, man. - What's that? - One, that I didn't have to work tonight. And number two, that I wasn't married. (men laughing) (men laughing) - I wouldn't even trip. Man, you got a good job and a wife who's down for you. You can ask anyone. - What a kick ass mood. - You know man, I don't know what I'm thinking about. I guess I'm just tripping. There it is, I'm tripping. - Fine hunnies in this gig, tonight. - You know it. - Squares, probably. - But you know, there's this one sorority, beautiful women, man. I can guarantee you can pull me some women there. (smooth music) - Hi y'all. - Hi. (people chattering) - Hey, so what's the cover? - $20. - Can you read? - $20? - Mm-hm. - I thought there was a part going on up in here. That's bullshit. - Oh, okay. This is a fundraiser, okay? This is a sorority fundraiser for the. - You know what? - No, no don't interrupt me. I am not finished. You are holding up the line. Take your nickel and dime back over. - I know that cover couldn't cover you ass. - Maybe. - Hell no. - Okay. Thank you. (people chattering) - Girl, this party is live. You see that guy in the black jeans? - You know, nobody back here's looking this good. You know what I'm saying? - Girl, don't ever (indistinct). - You're so negative. - It's good that I'm very picky with my men, like you guys should be. (woman laughing) - Well, y'all better come on before we miss all the action. - All right. - Now y'all don't be too fast out there now. - Good evening, ladies. - Hi. (people chattering) - Y'all coming in? - We'll be in there later. - Y'all got some ice for this here? - You know you can't bring that in there. - Uh-uh, uh-uh. - Uh-uh brother, come here.

Come on, Joshu, you got here. Let's scope the place out first. - Man, what the fuck you talking about? - Never mind, Joshu. Look, I'm going this way.

Still try, brother can't even get a dance in here. - Ooh, how you doing, ladies? Doing all right. - I'm so glad you came, Shoemie. - [Shoemie] Oh yeah. - I was really hoping you'd make it. You're not gonna believe this, but I had a conversation about you with my mom today. - [Shoemie] Is that good or bad? - It's good. I asked her to explain to me how I can be attracted to a man I hardly even know. You know I'm attracted to you, right? You seem to be the type of man who always has everything under control. You're educated, and you're handsome, too. - You know, Imani, I appreciate the compliment. What are you trying to say? - [Imani] Well I know you don't know me that well, but I was just hoping the feeling was mutual. - Yes it is. You know, I just want to call you all day and night. You stay on my mind, it's like. You know, Imani, you're like a dream come true to me. You're intelligent, beautiful, and that really turns me on. - You know what? The feeling is mutual. - [All] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Go, go, go, go, go! (people laughing) (smooth dance music) (people chattering) - Champagne? - Ah, yeah. You know what?

All the boys are getting them dates. Everyone was having a good time. Peak game. Nugi hit it off big with Tish. She fell right under his influence. - All right, go do what you gotta do. I'll be right here waiting for you. All right? Ha ha ha!

Doesn't happen often, but it happens. - [All] Hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho! - [Shoemie Voiceover] Joshu wasn't as lucky on the female side. But the jam they're listening to is his.

Yeah, well real businessmen run their businesses during the day, not at three and four in the morning. - I didn't see you complaining when I had you bent over that hot tub. Come here and stop tripping. - Excuse me. You know what? I thought you were cool. You know what? But you ain't. You know what? I wish I never would've gave you the time of day. - Aw shit, it ain't gotta be like that. You stuck on yourself anyway. Fuck you, bitch. - No. - Don't you ever try and hit me in your god damn life.

You're so mad. - Oh, well, basically I just told him where he can go. You know, I really love my black men, but ooh, they just irk me. Ooh, I swear. He is so self centered. All he cares about is himself. - You don't need that. - Oh no. Girl, he thinks he is all that and I am just not having it. You know, uh-uh. I don't even know why Shoemie hangs out with him. - [Men] K-A-Psi, and. (feet stomping) - Goodnight, ladies. - Bye. - Did you enjoy yourself? - Yeah. - Bye. - I don't know.

Okay. - Call me. - All right, see you later. - [Speaker] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. - [Group] Good evening. - I'm glad to be here. And especially in honor of these beautiful black young women. (audience applauding) Thank you. I would like to spread a little knowledge. Something I think that every human being should know. But first of all, this is not about race. It's about the understanding about the color of the face. - [Shoemie] What's up, man? You all right? - No man. Shit nigga. Say man, I ain't got time for these silly hoes. Man I hate this. Man, I didn't have to waste my time coming to your shit. - Yo man, look here. Let's roll on to the lake and go to my old spot and talk. Just like the old times. - All right, man, that sounds good, man. Let me finish this joint. Man, you want some? - No man, I'm good. I don't need that. - Aw shit man. You don't smoke or drink or do none of that shit, man. You make me feel guilty, man. - Yo man, I wouldn't even trip, man. I got a lot on my mind these days, man. That right there just fucks me up. I'm on a mission. - What mission? Getting Imani? I bet you aint' even kissed her yet. - Oh, there you go. Of course I have. - Oh yeah. How come I think you lying? No playing, homie? - Nah man. But you know what? Screw it, man. Yeah, aw man. - [Nugi] Hey man, I always like it out here, man.

Do you have any fears? - Ah Shoe, I ain't afraid of nothing, man. What you getting at? - I don't know man. Do you ever think about tomorrow? - Ain't no tomorrow, man. It's all about today. I know what you getting at, though. You just shocked at how I'm living, ain't you? - Nah, brother, I ain't shocked. I'm a little surprised. I didn't know you were involved so deep in the game. From what I understand, you're pretty large out there in the streets. - Gotta do what I gotta do. Say man, remember when you got on the plane to go to UW, man? Remember what you said to me, man? - Okay, yeah, yeah. - You said something about consequences and about being the best at whatever I do. - Right, right. I do remember. - I'm just an example of that, man. - I do remember. I do remember, man. We would go to Center Park. - Yeah man. - [Shoemie] Man, we was knocking clowns out. - Yup, I remember that shit. Damn. - [Shoemie Voiceover] In my first summer out of high school, we would go to the park in East Oakland and participate and bet on boxing matches. We made a lot of money that summer. And occasionally some punk would jump up. (people chattering) (people yelling) - Come on, punk. (people chattering) - Round three. Fight! (people yelling) (punch landing) (people yelling) One, two, three! The winner. (people yelling) - Get your ass. Come on, Paul! Come on, come on. We'll get another motherfucker. Good bye, bitch, good bye. - Behind the street, behind the street. Put the gun down, put the gun down. - Yeah, what's up? Get behind me, Nugi. (people yelling) - Man. - I remember that shit. - But you definitely took it the wrong way, man. I just expected better from you, man. On another hand, a brothers gotta do what he's gotta do to survive. - Say man, it's like hard die out here, Shoe. You know I got my tombstone already laid out, man. - Come on. - I accept any and all consequences that lay in the path that I chose, man. This is what I do, man. I don't give a fuck, man, it's what I do. When I'm tired of this. Man, let's go. - Yeah, I'm a little tired myself and I'm ready to go home. - Shit. The night just begun for me, homie. You know what I'm saying? - [Shoemie Voiceover] I don't know. Something felt different about this moment, and night. I guess we can't relive the past. We wish. But as time goes on, we all grow differently. (tense music) - You right here? - Yo man, thanks for the ride, man. I can walk home from here. - All right. Everything all right, man? - Yeah. - All right, dude. - Take it easy. I love you, man. Call me tomorrow, something.

You got me, you got me three weeks ago and I ain't even hearing that. - Angela, call the police. You gots to go, you gots to, see ya. Go, she's calling the police. Peace, gotta go. - Man, cracker. It ain't even like that. It ain't even like that no more. I ain't doing nothing for you. - Antonette, why are we stopping here? Andrea's right up the street. - Oh, don't worry. This is a good place to eat. - Okay. - Don't worry, it's safe. (people yelling) - How you doing there, ladies? - [Both] Fine. - It's pretty late, damn.

So Imani, what are you majoring in this fall? - Political science. - So you plan on getting involved in government work? - Yes, well I think I can make a difference within the judicial system. Eventually, I want to be kind of judge. - Confident are we? - Yeah well, I'm pretty disciplined. I think I have what it takes. - You know, Imani, I really appreciate it all what your sorority has done to keep the afterschool programs going. Now we have to work on improving them. - It's our pleasure working with these students. We enjoy helping to keep the programs alive. They need to use their time constructively. With all the drugs and violence out there these days, they really need a neutral zone. - That's real nice. Let's go outside and see what these knot heads are doing, okay?

He won us several city championships. He and his friend, Mookie. I sure did hate to see talent wasted, and I felt I could help Curtis, because he always took my advice in all issues. - Think man, you just have to decide what it is you want. Just go for it, man. - Man, I don't know, man. - When was the last time you seen Mookie? - Aw man. I ain't seen that motherfucker in hella long, man. I heard he off that shit, though.

Off the record? - Yeah. - Look man, there was almost a shooting here tonight. The guys involved were the same guys who shot Nugi. I convinced these guys that another murder was senseless and they left. - Did you see what they looked like? You see what kind of car they driving? Anything? - Man, they had guns everywhere, man.

We begin tonight with the story of Oakland City officials and residents coming together to fight the growing problem of violence and drug dealing in this city. Tonight more than 3000 Oakland residents packed a neighborhood forum meeting in central Oakland. The mayor spoke and told them that the young people must have viable alternatives to hang. - Yeah, I knew that all the time. - Positive part-time jobs for Oakland's teenagers. In addition, the mayor said a petition signed by over 50,000 Oakland residents will be sent to Sacramento. The petition demands the $1 million to start new afterschool programs and to continue to support those already established by the mayor. - It's what we've been needing all the time. - [Sherri] Businesses and thousands of city residents have already pledged to match the $1 million. - Y'all, it's about time y'all make that change. - A little later on this newscast, we will have, with the mayor, from the scenes of that town meeting in Central Oakland. - Fellas let's, let's go get something to eat. - That's real good right about now. - Before we leave, let's say a word of prayer. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Father God, I pray that you be over this grave. Just watch over Nugi. God, none of us know which direction we're going, Father God, when we leave here, and we do pray that you tell us Father God. So many, in so many ways, how to be right before you. God I pray for Nugi's soul. I pray that the rest of us, Father God, can always remember him in a good light that he shed in our lives, God. Just like Shoemie was saying, think of the positive things. God it's so clear that we gotta stick tougher, stick tighter together. God, we appreciate just this time, being able to come here just to reflect on him, and we do miss him so much. And it's in Jesus' name that we pray. Amen. - Amen. - [Shoemie Voiceover] I guess when you're in a game, you can never let your guard down because if you do, it may cost you your life. Consequences.
