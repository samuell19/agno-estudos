So they asked me to be quarterback, but I said no, 'cause I play better defense. - You can't play defense. Besides, you can't even play quarterback. - Would you be quiet? Mom, would you tell him to shut up? - Come on, you guys. - He's always interrupting me when I'm saying something. - Finish your cereal. You're gonna miss your bus, come on. - Aren't we all bright and cheery this morning? Morning, everyone. - Morning, Dad. - Morning, Dad. - Hold it, boys. Go give your father a kiss, okay? Wish him good luck on his presentation. - Don't have to fret over it. Bye David. - Bye Dad. - Philip. - Good luck. Bye Mom. - Thank you. Why didn't you tell me sooner? I wanted to be able to prepare something so I wouldn't look like an ass up there. - Would you mind playing daddy for a while? I gotta go get dressed and take her to school, okay? - Not at all. - Well what's the matter? You look so sad this morning, Cherie. - You work too hard, daddy. - Well daddy has to make money for you and your brothers and mommy. - It's no fun. - Come here. Now I promise you that as soon as I finish this new story, that we're all gonna go on a long and wonderful vacation. All of us, and I'm not gonna do any work. We're just gonna play, you and David and Philip. - And mommy? - Of course mommy. - When? - As soon as daddy's story's done. - But when? - Soon, Cherie. Very soon. - Promise, daddy? - I promise you. - Come on, let's get your coat on. Are you gonna be ready to go when I get back? It's only gonna take me a few minutes to change. - Bye daddy, good luck. - Let's go, come on. - You know, the most astonishing thing about education is how it manages to remain so consistently boring in its attempt to make life more interesting. Thank you, Professor. - That sarcasm is cute. Particularly coming from a woman who probably wouldn't have made it through freshman English if she hadn't-- - If I hadn't dropped my knickers for the Professor every night, and told him he was Leo Tolstoy reincarnate all day long? - Same sophomoric repartee. You want a coffee? - As long as we don't have to gulp it down. - It gives me great pleasure to stand here today because our guest is a man I respect both as an artist and as a friend. I'm proud to say that Steve Lessey was once a member of this faculty. And as a Professor, he was loved and respected. His unusual talent for analysis and understanding is well represented by his first book of critical excellence. Steven Lessey was routed from obscure Professor to writer and media darling when his first novel, "The Executioners" was made into a controversial film. His subsequent books and films proved that Mr. Lessey's sense of the horrifying and the macabre have made an indelible mark on our society and culture. Before I ask Steve to talk about himself and his work, let's watch a sequence from his latest film, "Anatomy of a Horror." - You again. I thought I told you to get out of here. Come on, come on! I thought I told you to get out of here! Get of out of here! Get on, go! Where the hell does it come from? Hey, what the... Hey! What's going on up there? Is somebody up there? Hey! What the hell? - Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the creator of that amazing sequence, Mr. Steven Lessey. Steve, before you have your say, I'd just like to present you with this plaque. Both to commemorate your appearance here, and in appreciation of your work. It was voted to you by the faculty of the graduate and undergraduate cinema studies department. Thank you Steve for a job well done. - First, I would like to thank you for this award. Coming from you, this means a lot to me. I must admit that writing my novels and their subsequent film scripts is the result-- - -all of you that good literature is simply insight into the familiar. The best book functions like a key to the soul. My soul and your soul. Isn't that right, miss... - Ramston. Elizabeth Ramston. - Do you agree, Elizabeth? - Yes, Dr. Lessey. - Experiment with the genre. My first book was called "The Executioners." It represented for me an opportunity to comment on what I believed to be the distasteful corruption of our society. The metaphor of execution is primary to our lives. We are all dying or being executed by our culture and our environment. - That may be true, Mr. Lessey, but don't you think your comments help contribute to the decay, instead of helping to solve it? - I don't offer solutions. I can only speak in the language of our times to comment on them. - Well do you mean that your horror is the language of our times? - I think horror represents a way of relating to numerous events that otherwise we might never be able to identify with. - Well I don't want to identify with horror. Well that's tough. - Come on grandma! Come on! Come on grandma, can you see? - I wonder where we are. - Come on. - I wonder where on Earth I am. - Come on, get down. I'm sitting? Isn't that nice? - Mr. Lessey, as an artist, how do you feel when you hear charges that your work is socially degenerate? - I think that many artists, Joyce, Burroughs, Lawrence, just to name three, had to face the criticism that their work is-- - Horse shit. You write horse shit horror. You exploit it for money, you expose society to your horse shit to grab off a few bloody bucks. - I don't understand this. - Is this a very good game, grandma? - I think it's a funny game. I don't understand this. - Are you comfortable grandma? Are you feeling okay grandma? - I wonder when your mom's coming. Now, come on. This game's over, come on, untie me. - I don't think I'm obligated to answer questions directed to me in an obscene and discourteous fashion. - You're obscene and discourteous. You peddle your junk on us whether we want it or not. And you needn't buy my books nor attend my movies. In a free society, that is your choice. You have the freedom of the marketplace. - Are you then admitting, Mr. Lessey, that you write only for the marketplace? - I think that my market represents a viable sociological cross section. - Which you pander to with no sense of social responsibility. - That's not true. A significant section of our community recognizes my work as an honest comment on our life and times. The sick and degenerate. Stop, stop! No, no! Let me out, let me out! No, no! Let me out, no! - Lessey, you sell sickness. And by selling sickness, you propagate it. You don't comment on blight. You are blight! - Please, please, Mr. Lessey is a respected artist. - Hold it. Hold it. Now I just want to say one thing. I try to represent what I see around me in metaphor. I have chosen horror as my particular vocabulary. That is my freedom of choice as an artist. - And it's our choice not to have your trash pollute us, Mr. Lessey. Keep your sickness. We don't want it anymore. - What's so funny, what are you laughing at? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry, I lost my head. I didn't know what I was doing. In two years, when those sons of bitches get out of that ivory tower, I wonder if they'll do as well as I have. - No, I don't imagine any of them will be quite as successful as you, Steven. - Aren't you coming to the studio with me? - I've seen enough humiliation today. I'll take a cab home. What time will you be finished? - I don't know. - Well don't forget Nadya's party tonight. You promised her months ago you'd be there. - Look, I'm gonna have to meet you there. - What do you mean meet me there? - I don't know what time I'll be finished at the studio. I'll meet you at the party, alright? Brother. - "Mr. Vampire" scene 82, take 15. Action. Come on, Darlene. A little faster. She can't move that fast, you know. Not when she's got a costume on. It's taking too long, Darlene. A little faster. Come on, come on, Darlene! Get the box. - The box in there? Take out the box. Open the box. Open the box. The line, Darlene. The line! The line! - Shit! - Cut. - This is a Lessey crock of shit, Burt. Steven, you've just got to come up with some better stuff. You can't expect me to fuck around in that costume all through the movie. - Perhaps I can arrange to have you fuck around bare-ass just like in real life. - I've had enough of this smart ass genius of yours, Burt. - Hey, I think this stuff looks good. - I'm walking out. If you want me back on the set, Then you get this motherfucker to write me some lines. Do you understand? I want lines. Call my agent. And you, you've got some fucking nerve calling yourself a director. - Darlene. - Boy, I'm getting tired of that bitch. Well, just ignore her, kiddo. - She's the star. - You're the star, Stevie. Now this picture's gonna be over in a couple of weeks, and it's gonna make millions because your name's on it, not hers. - Don't hype me, Burt. - No I'm serious, you're hot stuff, man. I mean, your books don't stop selling. This one's the same as the last one. It's the next one I'm worried about. - It's coming. - It's been coming for two months. I'm up to my ass in this, kiddo. I need pages, pages! I need 10, 15 pages of dynamite horrible stuff. - Look, Burt. I'm trying something a little different on this one. I need a little more time, that's all. - Different, how many times do we have to discuss this? I told you, leave the different stuff to the Europeans. They're good at it. You got a million dollar formula, use it. - We talked about this, Burt, when we started, right? We decided, we get a couple under our belt to get established, and then we can try other things gradually. - Now is not gradually, god damn it. You got the goose that lays the golden egg, and don't hatchet it for some artsy fartsy bullshit that's not gonna make a nickel. Besides, we don't have the time, kiddo. I sold you hard on this, you SOB. Now they want a Steven Lessey story. The money's right there, waiting. This is no time to change styles on me. Now we got a deal. You, me, and the guys that count. How many times do we have to go over this? I've got her head. - Okay hon, you're gonna be okay. That's a girl, that's a girl. Dr. Link's on his way, he's coming right in. - Take a deep breath, deep one. - Where's my husband? - He's right here, he's right here. - It's okay, I'm here. - Ron? - Good. - It's okay. - Mr. Turner, please. Stand over there. - Yeah. - This way, Mr. Turner. - Ron! - I'm here. I'm here, honey, it's okay. I'm here. - It's a beautiful day. - It's a beautiful day. - I'm alright, it's okay. - Just relax. - You look so funny in that. - Didn't you know I'm a doctor, too? - Okay Burt. - Now I'm serious, Steve-O. Now look, I don't want anything sopping. It's gotta be top. And when this is over, I don't care if you write a musical. You know I'm always available to you, Stevie. Call me the day after tomorrow. That's okay. - That's good. There he is, Emily! Here's Dr. Link. - Hi Emily, it's Dr. Link. - Doctor, she's fine. - How is she? - I didn't think you were ever gonna get here! - Just relax my dear, relax. - That's a girl, that's a girl. - What's wrong? Doctor? - Dad. - David, you can see I'm working. - Daddy, I can't sleep. I need a drink of water. - Why are you asking me? Ask your mother. - Mommy's not home. - I'm sorry, you're gonna have to get it for yourself. I'm just too busy. - Get the husband out. I'm gonna have to go in. - Get the husband out. - What's happening? Get the husband out of here. Get him out of here. - What's happening? Emily! Emily! What's wrong, is she alright? - Get it out, get it out. - What's wrong? Doctor! Doctor! - Mommy, mommy! Mommy, get up, get up, mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Daddy, daddy, come quickly! It's mommy, she's sick! Come daddy, come! Mommy, I'll get Sharon, just wait. Sharon, Sharon, come quickly! Mommy's sick! Come on, quick! Come, come! Mommy, get up. - Get up! Daddy, daddy! - Daddy! - Okay okay okay kids, I'll help mommy. I'll help mommy, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. - You were supposed to meet me at Nadya's! - I'm sorry, I forgot. - You forgot! You always forget! You bastard! - Now is not the time. - You bastard! - Now is not the time. - I have had it with you! I am fed up! You have stood me up for the last time! I will not be humiliated anymore! - Mommy, mommy fell, mommy! - Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I got her, okay, come on. - Put me down! Put me down! You will not humiliate me anymore! Mommy! - Put me down! You will not humiliate me! - Some display. That was just some fine display. I don't want to hear a bloody word out of you. This is all I need. I expect that kind of shit from the douche bags I put into my movies. And you had to do it in front of the kids, right? I got the kids to see it! I got Burt on my ass, I got my mother on my ass. I've tried to keep this place together. I don't believe what's going on. You are driving me, you're driving me crazy, and I don't need it. You see, I don't need it. And I don't need you! Damn motherfucking bitch! Alright the show's over. Come on now, stop that crying, young lady. That's it, right into your room. Mommy's alright, just go on to bed, come on. Up, David, now, now. That's it, come on, come on. David! Don't you dare. Now into your room right now. You heard me. Make it snappy. What did I tell you? She's a bitch. That's all there is to it, she's a bitch. My God, Emily! - Case number five. The postmortem gave the same results. It is as if suicide has been committed in the womb. It seems that the fetus in all five cases had consciously decided to die. Rather than be born and take their mothers with them. - Elizabeth. Elizabeth, look at me. Look at me. We're going to make this work. We're gonna make this work. - There's nothing left, Steven. - There is, there is. Don't you see, there is. Listen, there is. Damn it. Damn it! - What do you want, Steven? - May this mingling of the body and the blood bring eternal life to all who receive it. With faith in your love and mercy, I eat your body and drink your blood. And then he took up the cup and said, "Drink this wine. "This is my blood. Do this in the commemoration of me." - Daddy. Dad. Daddy. Dad, could you please help me with my homework? Philip, just a minute, please. - Dad, all I want you to do is show me how to do this. - Damn it, Philip. Can't you see that I'm working? Would you please leave me alone? - That's my bike. - It is not! - Get off, get off! - No, no, leave me alone! Leave me alone! Get off. - Leave me alone. Leave me alone! - Stop it. This is my bike, and I want to play with it. I am trying to work! - Motherfucker. - By the time that the nuns have finished, there are these huge holes appearing in the priest's body, and his organs are being exposed. - I love it, I love it!

It's nice to see a familiar face. - Yeah, same here. Where's Elizabeth? - I don't know. I'm looking for her. - I'll see you later. - Okay, bye bye. - Steven, you know Darlene Winters, of course. - Hello, Steven darling. - Darlene. I understand that they finally got you back on set, sweetheart. - Yes, and I understand that great pour of genius of yours is drying up. - Something that you should know a great deal about? - Here ya are Steven. - Thank you. - So, what happens next? - Nothing. - Nothing. You mean nothing yet. - No nothing at all, Burt, you see, because it's junk. It's just pure bullshit. - You haven't written anything yet. - I have written it and I have burned it. And I've re-written it, and I have burned it. - What?! I don't know what's with you, Stevie. Now it may be bullshit to you, but it's dollars to me, kiddo. Sure, you're riding high now. I don't know what it is, but the unwatched billions seem to think that sun shines out of your ass. But it won't last long. Take it from me. If you think we got enough to last us through to the deep six, then you're a bigger shmuck than I thought you were. - I am not writing crap anymore, Burt. - What else is there? - There's horror. Real horror, not the grade B blood and guts. I'm talking about the ultimate terror. That's what I'm reaching for, don't you see? No more shlock, Burt. From now on, we are building. I'll see you later. - Hold it. I gave you money to produce, and you come up with shit? The alternate side of the coin is a lawsuit. That means the cars, the house, God damn silk shirts on our backs. And take it from me, kiddo, you'll go first. Don't jerk me off. Everything you've got is on the line here. - I've got to find Elizabeth. - I need pages, Lessey, pages. - Great. - Good shit? - Great, great, great. - Can I call you tomorrow? - No Peter, I told you don't be calling me. You can't call me at home. - Hey hey not with the joint. Sorry. One look baby. One look baby, smiles at-- - Great, here. - Who's that? That's my old man. - Yeah? - Yep- - So that's Steven Lessey. Mr. Lessey, I know all your books. I can't say I like them, but they're highly inventive. And after all, isn't that what this business is all about? Being inventive. - Elizabeth, please. I would like to get going now. - I'm dreaming... - Elizabeth, it's time to go. - Hey, you sure you wouldn't like some of this? - ...of a white Christmas. - I mean, it might jerk off your brain. I mean, you might write some mean shit, man. - You could write some mean shit, Steven. No, he could, he's really good. - Elizabeth, please. - It's time to go. - Party's over. - Goodbye party - Bye bye bye bye. I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming. - I saw that movie of yours, man. - Oopsy daisy. - Where those guys hang those brats. I mean, how do you write that stuff, man? - Where are we going? - Home, I've got to work tomorrow. - Steven, why are we going? It's still early. - It's 1:30. Who's babysitting? - I was out all day. That was your responsibility. - You mean you haven't been home? - No. - Well who is sitting with the children? - I don't know, that was your responsibility. - Where's the telephone? - Steven, are those kids home alone? I told you when I left this morning. Didn't you see the note I left you? - I was working, God damn it. You can't expect me to think of everything. - You don't even have time to take care of your own children. - Philip, hello. Yes, it's daddy. Yes, yes, no I know, I know. Listen, did you kids get anything to eat? Alright, I'm gonna phone grandma. She's gonna come over in a few minutes and fix you something, alright? Yes no, yeah, we're having a good time, but you kids don't-- - Are they alright? - Okay, now you're sure everybody's fine? Okay fella, bye bye. What kind of a mother are you? - Same kind of a mother as you are a father. What am I gonna tell my mother? - Whimper a lot, she'll understand. When you're ready to go, I'll be where you found me before. - How much of this stuff are you into? - What stuff? - Coke, drugs, whatever. - As much as whatever as I can buy. Why, does it bother you? - Bother. You come home smashed. God knows with who, where, or why. You pass out in front of the children. Sure, it bothers me. - Tell me Dr. Lessey, do you suppose that perhaps your wife's drug addiction could be symptomatic of a psychological malaise? A discontentment, perhaps. - You're stoned out of your mind. - Or could it be that her prick husband abandoned her, fucked her over years ago, just to get it on with a sick little typewriter's keyboard. Could that be the silly little bitch's problem? - That's alright, Elizabeth. Just change the focus of this conversation from you to me. - No! It's all over, Steven. - We're gonna see a doctor. It's not over. - A doctor? Right, right, we'll see a doctor, Stevie. Right, you call the doctor, and you pay the bill, and guess what. Everything's gonna be just fine. Just fine, God. What doctor is gonna help you write again? - Hi. - Hi daddy, where's mom? - Where's mommy? - Mommy's not feeling well. She's in the car. - Where's mommy? Where's mommy? - Where's mom? - In the house, in the house. - Where is she? - In the house, in the house. - Where is she? - She's okay, she's just not feeling well. - Is mommy okay? - Where's mommy? - She's fine, she's fine. - Is she alright? They just wouldn't go to sleep before you got home. - She's fine, had a little too much to drink. - Are you sure she's okay? - She's great, she's just tired. She's had a rough day, alright? - Goodnight, dad. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, dad. - Goodnight. Say goodnight to mommy. I sure will. Do you want some coffee? - I thought I told you to leave me alone. I want to see my children. - If you think-- - Stop lecturing me!

Aw, dad. - I got an idea. I have to go to the studio. Why don't we drive up there together? - Dad, may I watch it?

I do not have to put up with this shit. - An artist? You can't even spell a word! - You son of a bitch. This is insane. But by then, it was already too late to save the victims who were overcome by smoke. - Can't feel it. I can believe that. This just in. A tragic accident in Downtown Toronto an hour ago. A pre-teenage killing. Police are on the scene at the moment of what many have already termed the most shocking tragedy of the year. Two children aged nine and seven hanged their five year old sister while playing. Both parents were out at the time. - That's right, just go for the sensationalism. As we receive them. In the meantime-- ♪ I've been living so all alone - And now we take you to our on the stop news team. Here's Paul Henry to report from the scene of the accident. - Well John, the two sons of famous screenwriter Steven Lessey were watching television tonight. They were seeing one of the father's movies, the famous "Executioners." The film depicting a series of hangings by children apparently prompted his two sons to mimic the scene using their seven year old sister as the victim. While the tragedy occurred only an hour ago, it has already caused various social groups to react against violence on our screens. - There he is. - There's his car. - Alright. This is a shocking incident, Mr. Lessey. Does your wife know about this yet? - Where were you at the time of the accident? - When did you first hear about the accident? - Mr. Lessey, please. Do you attribute Sharon's death to the final sequence-- - Mr. Lessey, wait! - What, what? Dr. Masters. - There's been a terrible accident. But they were only playing. No don't. - Sharon. - They were only playing. Apparently the boys tied this around her neck, like in your movie. She slipped, and they weren't able to get it untied in time. It's a terrible, terrible tragedy. It's nobody's fault. Come on. - No, wait, wait. Where are you taking her? Where is Elizabeth? Wait wait, where are you going? Where is Elizabeth? - Damn you, Steven! Damn you! You killed her! You killed her! - Where's David and Philip? - They're upstairs, in the living room with your mother. There's a police inspector with them. - Don't you touch them! Don't you touch them! Leave them alone! Leave them alone! Leave them alone! Leave them alone! - Where were you? Where were you? - Leave him, leave him alone, you bastard! You bastard! Damn you Steven! Damn you Steven! Damn you! No. - Mr. Lessey, it's a terrible loss, sir. I'm very sorry. There will be an inquiry, of course. A procedure then a complete report will be made. I need you to accompany the children down to the station right away. - Don't be afraid. I'm not angry with you. I just wanted to know what happened. Where was mommy? Why didn't you call her? Was mommy alone? Or was she with someone? Boys. - Steven, don't you dare. - David, David, she was with someone, wasn't she? Wasn't she with someone? Well tell them what kind of a mommy she was, tell them. Philip. Why this, Philip? What have I ever done to you, bastard? - Steven, no! - Why did you do this to me? Why? Why? - Steven, stop it! - Why, why, Why? - I hate you, daddy, I hate you! - That'll be enough for tonight, ma'am. - The children will be staying with me, Inspector. Mr. and Mrs. Lessey feel it's best for them for the time being. - We'll contact you when we need the children again. - Thank you. - I like Toronto. It's clean, you know. Too clean. Still, it's just about the only city you can walk around at 2:00 in the morning and not get mugged. They don't make good pictures, though. I don't understand why you don't move to LA, Steve. Just tell me when, there's no problem. You know, the only thing that's gonna take your mind off this is work. Why don't you let me send you down to my place in Florida? Take a couple of weeks off, relax, take it easy. You had breakfast yet? - No. - Is the plane ready? We'll have lunch in Montreal. Burt, hello! - Hello, gorgeous. This is my friend Steven. I want you to take very good care of him. - Okay. - Fasten your seatbelts, guys. We're in for a bumpy flight. Hey, isn't that what Benny Davis says in, what's the name of that film? - "All About Eve." - Yeah, what was it she said? - I think she said, "It's gonna be a bumpy night." - Bumpy night. I could've swore she said bumpy flight. Well, there's no plane sequence in that film. Why would she say that? Steven, you haven't touched your food. Here come the girls. Ladies. - Whatever. Here we are. Now, this is Steven Lessey, ladies. Famous screenwriter. Treat him good, he might put you in a movie. There's one thing about these French broads. They don't bleed you to death to fuck 'em, you know? I mean, if you're gonna get it, you know right away. If they hate your guts, you know that too. English broads, you don't even know if you're gonna get it, and by the time they drain you for a couple hundred, you've lost interest anyway. WASPs are the worst. I just told 'em I'm Jewish. Okay Steve, let's cut the bullshit, get down to business. Now you had a tough time, really tough, and I'm sorry. I mean, I really am. But that script was supposed to be ready weeks ago. The money's gotta be spent before the end of the year or the project's off. That money's only there because of your name. I'm committed myself. It's my God damn money and I need that script. Now here's what's gonna happen. We're gonna go back to Toronto. My car, will take you to your house. You'll pack, and get back to the jet. Then my guys will take you to Florida, or LA, or wherever the hell you have to go, and get back to writing. - Shall I come in and help you pack, sir? - No, you wait here. Now I need that script, and I want it in two weeks. - I'm not going. - Sir? - Tell Mr. Horowitz I'm not going. - But sir, Mr. Horowitz instructed me to be sure that you-- - Damn Mr. Horowitz. What the fuck do you think you're doing? The driver just called me on the car phone. Is this some sort of game you want to play? I'll sue you 'til you're on your knees fucking begging, Steve-O. We're not playing games here. We're not playing games. You hear me? Steven, Steven, are you there? Hello? Hello? God damn it, Steven, you're there, I know you're there. Now you listen to me, that car is still waiting outside. You get in that car and deliver, or so help me God, I'll put-- - I walk the wet boulevard alone. An open invitation to anyone. I bit my lips to keep back the tears. What would they think? I cared not, I dared not. All I had were the tortured memories of a love I had once known. I could still feel his burning kisses on my virgin lips. When you look at me, it's like any grade B movie. I whisper, "Hello Johnny." - What was your name again? - Honey, and yours? Suckle, Honey, Suckle. You know, I have written a dozen scripts like this, and I still don't know how to pick you girls up. - When you look at me, it's like any grade B movie. I whisper, "Hello Johnny." - You just come with me, big boy. You just come and suck a little Honey? - Now listen, I don't mean to offend you Honey, but I think I kind of prefer your friend here. The two of you? - The both of you? Only you. - Greedy bastard. - Jesus Christ. - No no, I mean it. Why don't we have a party? I'll tell you what. You get some of your friends. I'll tell you what, you get some of your friends here, and we will have ourselves a party. Come on. - Let's go. - Come on, let's go. - Let's go, girls. Party time, come on. - Okay I'll help you. Here we go, everybody. Now it's not much, but I just like to call it home, you know what I mean? Come on. - Looks like my place. - Come on. Come on, let's go. - Almost there. - Wait up, I'll get it. There you go, everybody, yeah, that's it. That's it. Are you sure that we're not related? That's it. - Okay girls, girls, here, follow me. Follow me. Here we go. Because you see, it is party time. Party! - Whoa, come on, that's it. Right over here. Whoa, whoa. Drinks are in the corner. Drink are in the corner. That's it. Music, music, we need some music. And what have I got? Who are you? What do I got for you. I know what you want. - What? Here you go, come on. Come on. Sit right there. Movies! Movies, it's movie! Because you see this is what made it all happen! I love that music. Rock it, It goes right on there. There you go. Here we go. Lights on, and there. Lights, lights, we need the lights. Don't worry, things are gonna get better. Okay, okay. Make room for daddy. Make room for daddy. I think you're gonna like this. - Let's get into some of this coke. - I thought you had the munchies. - Hey, what's happening? - Holy shit, look at that. Wow! - Holy shit, fantastic! - Yeah, wow. - Wait a sec, you gotta watch this. It's so bad, it's good. - Hold it back! - Hold it! - Give us this. - Alright let's go, come on. - Give me some more! - Steven Lessey, you are a genius. - No no, watch this. This is really, no, really. No, come on, really, really. - Come on, honey. Drink it up. - That's right. - Good boy. - Come on, come on. - One good gram. - Right up there, get it up. - Let's just get you a little comfortable, ok? - Watch for the bottle. - Come on. - Daddy! - You need some more, come on. Just a little more, come on. Come on, just suck it up. - More, come on, do it. Do it, do it. - Come on. - Daddy! - Here, put this around your neck. - Sharon, no! - What you do is push it, push it. - What's the matter? What's the matter? - Daddy! - Sharon! Sharon! Sharon! - Let's go. - Daddy! Untie me, untie me. Untie me. Daddy! Daddy! - Fabulous. - Stop it. - No! - Daddy, I can't sleep. - No! Get the fuck-- - Daddy, daddy! Daddy! - What the hell? - You fucker! - Son of a bitch! - Come on, let's get the hell out of here. - How do you like that, fucker? - Well thanks for the party, sucker. Daddy. Daddy. - Steven! Steven! - Steven. - Elizabeth? Steven. Steven. - Elizabeth? - Burt Horowitz please, it's Steven Lessey. I see, would you have him call me back? And miss, tell him that I've found it, that I've got it. Yes, and tell him that he'll love this one. Thank you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Keep your sickness. We don't want it. - Don't leave! - I hate you daddy, I hate you! - Get it! - It's too tight. - Get it. - I'm trying to, I'm trying. - If I had a gun, I'd sneak around in the middle of the night and shoot us all. ♪ We're not here to compromise ♪ We're only here to realize ♪ A life that's made from everlasting love ♪ And so it seems we improvise ♪ A life that's really synthesized ♪ From dreams we're all receiving from above ♪ And so we come to sympathize ♪ To learn the truth and harmonize ♪ With everything around us that we see ♪ And some will live and learn to cry ♪ While others laugh and learn to die ♪ But sadness comes to only those who feel ♪ And what about the angels ♪ Who were sent to save our souls ♪ Where are they when life is so confused ♪ And what about the promises of making life so good ♪ Could it be they're already used ♪ And so our lives are justified ♪ And all our questions satisfied ♪ Still we seek the truth to make us free ♪ And when at last we're purified ♪ And every spirit unified ♪ God will come to tell us what we'll be ♪ Most of all, the love will come ♪ When we all understand ♪ That life is just a game that makes us real ♪ Those who give will surely live ♪ And someday understand ♪ Gladness comes to only those who feel ♪ And we're not here to qualify ♪ We're only here to simplify ♪ A life that gives us everlasting love ♪ And now that we've been moralized ♪ And all the symbols analyzed ♪ God must come to tell us what shall be
