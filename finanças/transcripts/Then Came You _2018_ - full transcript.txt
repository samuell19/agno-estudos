[electricity buzzing] [birds chirping] [rooster crowing] Subtitles by explosiveskull [woman] I'm so sorry, Skye. The tumor just hasn't responded to the treatment. Pretty soon you'll feel your energy levels drop dramatically, and your mobility will become increasingly restricted. I'm afraid it's about quality of time now. Win some, you lose some.

He's not my type. Girl, I'm starting to believe you don't have a type. [horn honking] - [man] Lady, need a ride? - No, thanks. Sorry about my son, his wife's still breaking him in. [man laughs] Hey, the other boy, he's a sweetheart. All right. [both laughing, chattering indistinctly] [hammering] [watch beeping] [people applaud] Thank you for sharing, Ann. So, listen, guys, why don't we try an exercise? - [man groans] - OK, relax. It's not a test. [laughs] Here you go. Now, make a list, all right? Make a list of all the things that you wanna do. All right, let your imaginations run wild. If you want to scale Everest, then go ahead and write that down. What if I want to rob a bank? [laughs] I can't say that I approve, but go ahead and write it down. I know a good lawyer. Feel free to inspire each other, OK? Use each other for support. [chair scraping] [man] Nice of you to join us, Skye. Well, you know me, Dan. I'll be late for my own funeral. [Dan] Yeah, well, you're more than welcome to stay but any repeat of last week's behavior, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. I'll be good as gold. All right. You're new. I'm Skye. Calvin. So, what are you doing here, Calvin? Some terrible exercise about climbing mountains and shit? Yeah, actually. [whispers] Want to copy mine? I'm a little promiscuous when it comes to support groups. What's with you? Sorry, your... face. I... That was a wink, dummy. Playtime's over, get back to work. [indistinct chattering] What now? I don't know what to write. Write anything. No one cares. You're dying, remember? Just don't write something cliche, like "swimming with dolphins". And don't write "Disneyland". I've been to Disneyland, it's shit. Plus, there's, like, 1,000 dying kids there, so no one treats you special or anything. Not even Mickey Mouse, that's, like, passe to him, you know? You got a girlfriend? - Hm? - Boyfriend? No. But there's someone you like, hm? Maybe you think about them - when you're... - Jesus! - [Skye] Well? - Can you leave me alone, please? - Just tell me her name, dummy. - Don't call me that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I just get so angry sometimes, you know, I lash out. It's so unfair, I should have my whole life ahead of me. I'm screwing with you. Give me that. That'll do for starters. - [Dan] Great job today, guys. - See you, Calvin. - [man] Thank you, Dan. - [Dan] Thanks again. Great job. - Hey, Dad. How'd it go? - Well, still got cancer. Yeah, I'm aware. It's a support group. I know, it's not voodoo. - [loud thud] - Oh, come on. You're killing me! Hey, Calvin. Help a girl out? I'm gonna be late for work. Oh, come on, it will just take a second. Just, you know, push it or something. Not like that. Come on, put some hurt on it! - Ow! - Yay! Go, Calvin! Want one? Sucks, huh? The big "C". They've run out of stages for me now, what about you? I gotta go. Hey. - Hey, you dropped this. - [door closes] I thought I felt something. [girl giggles] There's nothing wrong with you, Calvin. I just don't know how many more ways to say it. Well, what about my symptoms? You say that you experience pain, discomfort, and I believe you, but that's not indicative of cancer. OK, and what about my mole? It's the same size that it was last week. Then maybe we should do more tests, just to be sure. There aren't any more tests. Your health issues aren't physical. I thought sending you to that support group would give you a bit of perspective. I'm not making this up. All right? - Calvin... - I'm not a hypochondriac. [doctor] Your symptoms journal?

That was you, right? With your dad and your brother? Mm-hm. Sorry about that. I know all about it. I have four... brothers. - Back in Ohio. - Cool. You've obviously never been to Ohio. I don't travel much. You work at an airport. - I've never flown. - What? Really? I... How is that even possible? You, my friend, are a disgrace to the aviation industry. [laughs] So, what do you write in there? Oh, um, stuff, you know. Sounds like a bestseller. [woman on PA] Calvin Lewis to the information desk. Calvin Lewis to the information desk. - That's me. - Guess you should go then. I'm Izzy. - Um... - Um... OK. See ya. Hi, I'm Calvin Lewis. - Hi, Calvin! - [Calvin] Hi. - [Skye] Hi. - What are you doing here? Oh, you dropped this at the meeting. Oh, you have another one. [Calvin] Do you not have, like, school? Is this your ride? - Wow. - Yes. - Can I take it for a spin? - No. - Please? - No. But I'm dying. OK, it's not insured for civilians, so... Civilians? Oh, come on, I'm not gonna sue. - Cross my heart and hope to... - Skye. So, are you one of these guys that's always going on strike and breaking people's stuff? [groans] No. Have you ever gone through someone's luggage? What's the weirdest thing you've ever found? I bet you've found some filthy things, haven't you? Go on, you can tell me, I'm really good at keeping secrets. - I'm about to go on shift, so... - Oh, amazing, I will come with. What? No, I'm... Is that a goldfish? Yeah, he's for you. This is Boris. But you can call him whatever you want because, you know, the whole three second memory thing. Oh, my God. Um... Why are you here? You are just as bad as Boris. I'm here to return your ID. OK. Thank you. Um... now, could you please go? I mean, I could. Look, I'm sorry to be blunt, OK? It's just the way I am. But if you're gonna beat this thing, you're gonna have to grow a pair. You don't have cancer of the balls, do you? Because that would make me kind of a dick. - No, I do not have... - Oh, thank God. OK, so we start tomorrow. - Start what? - My to-die list. It's like a bucket list but not as lame. Don't worry, I'm not gonna drag you to Amsterdam. - I've got work tomorrow, so... - Play the cancer card. Cancer card? I have cancer. Sometimes they give you money. - So what do you say? - Um... Are you down or are you down? Mm! Let's do this. Um... I'll meet you at the fountain at four. Take good care of Boris! So, Lucy, seriously, what do you think? On time, week early, week late? No, no, no, no, just pick a day. Pick a day. - Wait, what are you guys doing? - It's a gentleman's bet. Just trying to get a gauge. OK. The baby's gonna come when it's gonna come, Bob. OK, well, just so you know, these Lewis boys all came late. Isn't that right, Ellen? So, you gonna head back to college next year? I don't know. Haven't really thought about it. Figured after six months at the airport, you'd be running back. You know, I don't mind working there. Twelve hour shifts, back-breaking labor? Yeah, what's not to like? All right, take it easy. [scoffs] How's that working out for ya? You can stay here as long as you like. - His tests came back clean. - Leave him alone. No, no, no, you just spent money that you don't have, testing for something that he never had. Thanks for dinner. Ashley, please tell me Will is coming to your party. Did someone say "party"? Skye. You look like you seen a ghost. Just haven't seen you around lately. Been busy. Who knew dying could be so time-consuming? So... we've gotta go. You coming, Ashley? [Ashley] I'll catch up with you guys. OK. See you, Skye. So, I'm having a party this weekend. Cool. You should come. If I have the time, sure. Cool. I should catch up with them. - Right. - Bye. I thought we were meeting by the fountain. You came. - You OK? - I have cancer. Right... about that... - Less talk, more shopping. - [Calvin] OK. [Skye] You know, it's kinda creepy that you're hanging out outside the ladies' changing room. I'm fine. So, how long you been in the States? Dad moved us here when I was ten. You at Kingston High? East Kingston. Go Bluebirds, whoo. Skye, you know, - something I should tell you... - Let's go. The kind of support group thing we were at? - Can you run in those shoes? - I don't... What? Never mind. Hold this. What's in it? Skye. [Skye] Run! Run? Oh. [taser buzzing] Wow. Doesn't even match. [woman] That is some stone cold pervert 101 shit right there. Wait a minute. I knew I recognized you, I never forget a face. This guy goes to my old man's cancer support group. No shit. Oh, new meds, right? When my old man's medications change, he goes batshit crazy too. [woman] Come on, you should have said something. All right, get up, boy, you're OK. All right, not your fault. Not your fault. OK, case closed. Hey. You fight this shit, you hear me? - Yeah! - [Calvin grunts] That was so balls-out amazing! - You get off me! - They full on tasered you! I can't believe that wasn't on my list! You set me up! I told you to run. I could have been arrested! And I could have lived to 102. You stole some shit, you got away with it. Just enjoy the moment. OK, so you got tasered. And pissed yourself? Eww. But you did something you've never done before. Doesn't that feel good? Admit it, it's a rush. Give me your hand. Feel that? Do you feel that? - Yes. - [Skye] What does that mean? It means I'm alive. No, Calvin, it means you're a pussy. How do you expect to beat a lie detector test if you can't regulate your heartbeat? Why would I need to beat a lie detector? Because it's on the list, dummy. [sighs] I give up. I used to think you were cool, Calvin, but you're not. Don't ever call me again. I don't even have your number. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Skye, wait! What else is on your list? [squeals] [upbeat music] [woman sings in foreign language] [song ends] [Skye] So did you ask what's-her-name out on a date yet? No. Does what's-her-name have a name? Izzy. Izzy, Izzy, Izzy, Calvin's getting busy. [gasps] Is she here, can I meet her? No. Skye, I need to tell you something. You're a virgin, I know. I'm not a virgin. - Really? - Why? I... I'm just surprised. You kinda have that aura. Now can you be serious about something? I can be serious about finding Izzy. Get off the road! Girl, you didn't even take any selfies. And where are the hot boys? Unlike you, I actually care what's on the inside. Wow. Do you think she's too cool for me? She's too everything for you. - [phone ringing] - [Julian] Hi. [Skye] Ooh! Now's your chance! Drive up there and whisk her away. Do I have to do everything? No, Skye. I don't know if I should give this to you. She's so out of your league. Fine. I can just ask her out whenever I want, I see her all the time. What if she says no? When you call her, ask her what she's wearing. Girls like that. [Calvin] Hey... Hey, Izzy. [clears throat] It's Calvin. Hey. Hey, Izzy. Hey, Izzy, what are you wearing? Hello, Izzy. Creepy. I'm Calvin. Sup, Izzy? It's Cal. It's Cal. What's up, Iz? It's Calvin. [phone ringing] - Hey, Izzy. It's Cal... - [woman] Hello. Thank you for calling Albany Flight School. For information on becoming a flight attendant, please leave your name, number and a detailed message. Thank you and have a nice day. [message beeps] [doorbell rings] Whoo! Sorry, I'm... I'm Calvin, Skye's friend. Why was he dressed as a ghost? - What are we doing? - Oh, my God. You look grown up. - Thanks. - Skye, who's Calvin? Calvin's here. Why didn't you say? Wait, why do you look grown-up? Ashley's having a party, old friends are gonna be there. Um, but so are parents, so, you know, lame. You're going to a party. Yeah, Calvin's bringing me. And who's Calvin? Don't worry, we won't be late. Skye. Your mum asked you a question. - Who's Calvin? - Who's Calvin? From my support group. I can't believe this wasn't on my list. Did you steal it? Let's just say I know a guy. What? I know people. And, hey, I thought you said this was a costume party. Oh, it is. I just, I didn't think my parents would approve of mine. - Should I be worried? - When are you not? Watch it, you're swerving all over the place. OK, I'm not swerving. This is swerving. [laughs] [sirens wailing] Oh, no. No, no, no. Ruh-ro, maybe not the best time to come out of your shell, Calvin. Think we can outrun them? Stop, just stop, just stop. - License and registration, sir? - Yeah. [laughs] It's you. Man, this is a nice rig. What is this, custom? Jesus H. Christ, it is you. How you been, man? - Are you still fighting back? - Mm-hm. [laughs] Hang on, you were at the support group too. No, for real? Straight up and down. No, I'm good, I'm good, I'm gonna... - Um... Whoa! - [officer] Fuck cancer! I'm gonna walk this off, you guys have a good night. All right. Hey, bro, you need anything, anything, you give your boy a holler, all right? We confiscated some high-grade icky, would you like some, sweetie? You know, he's... We're driving. No. I'm driving. Oh, right. Sorry. I'm here for you, bro. Just a call away. Holy shit, Calvin, you've got the cops on speed dial. [Calvin] So, I called Izzy. [Skye] Oh, yeah? How did that go? - [loud music blaring] - [Skye] Look alive! [Calvin] Skye, you said people were getting dressed up. [Skye] Oh, dear Calvin, always with the negativity. Come on. [Calvin] Skye, hold up. What up, bitches? Death's in the house! Skye, hey. How'd you know it was me? [laughs] So are you drinking tonight? Or are you all, like, super medicated and shit? Yeah, I'm drinking. [girl] Yeah! Chug, chug, chug!

[laughs] - [Skye] Oh, man down. - Are you OK? I'm-I'm fine. I think I need off my feet for a second. OK, yeah. [beeping] Skye, Skye, we gotta go. Oh, but I'm having so much fun. - Please, please. - Boop. Come on. Skye. Skye. - [crying] - [vehicle approaching] Skye, get in the car. Stranger danger! - Stranger danger! - Can you keep your voice down? [whispers] Stranger danger. Skye. Ashley knows how much I like him. Skye, please. Your parents are gonna kill me.

[Skye] Hey, Calvin. - [Calvin] Skye. - Back from the dead. - Are you OK? - No thanks to you. "Come to the party", you said. "It'll be fun." - No, you invited me. - [Skye] Tomato, tomahto. Are your parents mad at me? You left me on the porch and ran away. You completely bailed on me, man. Well, you shouldn't have put me in that position, Skye. Do you know how worried I was? No, Calvin, I must have missed your calls. Is this a game to you? I'm dying. You can't keep pulling that on me. No, Calvin, I mean I'm dying. What am I supposed to do, curl up in a ball and cry? I've done that, all right? I just... I wanted to have some fun. I'm sorry I ruined your life. I mean, you were doing great before I came along. [Izzy] Hey, guys. - Izzy. - Hey, girlfriend. - What's up? - Did you call that number? They're sending out the information. I think you'll be a great flight attendant someday. Maybe you can even get your brother to fly with you. - [softly] Brother? - [Skye] That's the dream. - Join us, sit down. - [Calvin] Skye. I really should get going. Boyfriend waiting for you? No, no, no boyfriend. [clears throat] Well, what are you waiting for? Pull up a pew. OK. Just for a second maybe. Have you tried these muffins? They are to die for. - Um... OK. - [Skye] So, Izzy. I've got this dilemma. There's, like, this boy that I really like and I want to go on a date with him, like, so bad, but our parents are being all psychotically parental about it. Anyway, long story short, I can't go without a chaperone. So I came here to beg my big brother to help his sister out. Calvin here thinks it's way too late to ask someone and... [gasps] Oh, my God. - You guys should go together. - [Calvin] Skye. Not like a "date" date, that would be weird, you guys just met, but, FYI, if you wanted to, like, you could totally pull that off. [Calvin clears throat] Just go, you know, as colleagues. We're not exactly "colleagues". Aren't we all colleagues, though? You know, like when you really think about it? - [Calvin clears throat] - Huh. Hm? - Please? Please? - Well... Please, please, please, please, please, please? Oh, I would love to help, but I've had a crazy week and I just... - [gasping] - What did I say? There's no way she could have known. Known what? You tell her. Tell me what? I have cancer. It's a rare strand, I don't have much time left. I don't know what to say. [Skye] You don't have to say anything. Just come to the movies with us. [Izzy] What just happened? [clears throat] You look nice out of uniform. I don't look nice in uniform? Well, no. I mean, I didn't, I... [laughs] Maybe you should try Skye again. She does stuff like this all the time. Like pretend she's your sister? Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm sure she's fine. But she really is sick, right? Yeah, um, we met at some cancer support group. Oh, my God. - I had no idea. - No, I... Yo, yo, yo, make some room for your girl Skye. What up, peeps? Miss me? - Jig is up, Skye. - Bollocks. - You're late. - [Skye] Shh, it's starting. A little thank you would be nice. What, for ruining my chances with Izzy? Oh, come on, I set you guys up. I'm like a postmodern Cupid. She thinks I have cancer! - So? - Well, Skye, I don't. I know. What? I overheard you talking with Dan. And you didn't say anything? You're the one pretending to have cancer. - Oh, no, no, I never said... - Anything? - I tried to tell you. - Right. Congrats, it must be real nice having a clean bill of health. Where are you going? - Home. - No. No, Skye, you're the one who came to me. - My bad. - No, I wanna know why. - Just leave me alone. - Tell me why. Because it's on the list, OK? Where? What? "Punch someone in the face"? No, help a sad case. Wow. Thanks. Before I got sick, I was just waiting for my life to start. Turns out, life doesn't work that way. I thought maybe I could help you see that. I didn't ask for your help. Friends don't wait to be asked. You know, I actually liked you. I mean, sure, you're hung up and weird, and if I had a single other friend in the entire world, I'd probably have nothing to do with you. But as messed up as that is, I liked you. I thought you liked me too. Skye, I d... I do! - I want to be your friend. - Why? Because... you terrify me and... you excite me and when you're not around... I miss you. You really miss me? Yes, I do. Like, how much? Like, on a scale of one to 10? Oh, my God, Skye. Stop. You're not gonna try and kiss me now, are you? Are you really gonna punch someone in the face? Ooh! [Calvin] Are you sure we're allowed to be in here this late? Before state, coach gave us key cards so as we could train here whenever we liked. You can change in... there. It's fine, don't worry about it. Then why are we whispering? I don't make the rules. You make all the rules. [Skye whispers] I heard that. [Skye retching] [toilet flushing] [breathing heavily] You jumped off of that? I didn't jump, Calvin. It's not called "state jumping championship". Well, you go first. Wuss.

No. Oh, come on, it's just, it's the little one, you'll be fine. - I'm just gonna... - You can do this. OK, yeah, just stand, that's it. Just stand and just look forwards. Look forwards, don't look down. Oh, my God, you're erect! - [board creaking] - Oh. [Skye] What is this? [laughs] - Where are you going? - One second. No, no, Calvin.

[chuckles] This guy took me to the movies once. Halfway through, he goes to the bathroom and when he comes back, he sits three rows in front of me and puts his arm around some random girl. He thought she was you? I didn't stick around to find out. [laughs] [phone chiming] You gotta go? I have some time. Izzy, these are incredible. You really like them? Are you kidding? They're amazing. - [phone chiming] - [Izzy] Oh, my God. I'm gonna miss my flight. I can give you a ride, if you want. - Really? - Yeah, I got a tug. Uh-oh. Mom looks mad. OK, well... I'd better go. Um... Izzy, do you want to, like, do you want to hang out sometime, just the two of us? Without Skye? I'd like that. Let's go! Girl, you better get your scrawny ass on this plane. That's the guy you're dating? He's two years younger than me. All right, fine, three. Look, I know it's weird, but there's something about him. Something... rich? He's sweet. - And he's thoughtful. - Girl... Just make the announcement. Calvin... have you ever killed anyone? No. [woman] That's true. Skye, have you ever killed anyone? Yes. - [officer] That's a lie. - [sighs] This is harder than I thought. Calvin, is Skye your best friend? No. - That is a lie. - [Calvin] What? - [laughs] - Well, am I your best friend? - No. - Definitely a lie. Calvin, real life situation. Do you smell your own farts? - [laughs] - No. [snickers] [all giggling] It's inconclusive. Calvin Lewis, would you switch places with me if you could? Yes. [sobs] [floorboards creaking] Hi, love. Hi. Dad in? No, should be back soon. Wanna watch a film tonight? Something funny. Yeah. That's a good idea. - Cup of tea? - Yeah. [TV on faintly] [laughs] You think we made the right choice, not going back to England? It's not what she wants. All her friends are here. Not like she sees them. Spends all her time with Calvin. Well, he... he seems to be helping. Do you think we can trust him? It's not him that I'm worried about. [buzzing] - [officer] All right, let's go. - Skye, how was this on the list? It says it right here. "Get arrested with Calvin." You just added that in. My list, my rules. Lock him up. - Skye, this isn't funny. - [Skye laughs] Yay, Calvin! You know how fast you were walking? On an incline. Is that a thing? Is that even... - It's absolutely a thing. - [mocking] "Is that a thing?" Kids these days, I tell ya. What do you even see in this guy? Are you jealous? No. Oh, my God, you're totally jealous. I'm not jealous. - Come here, just a little bit. - Yeah. Skye Aitken, you know her? Skye Aitken, like, look at like eight o'clock. - Eight o'clock. - Over there. - Da-da-da-da-da! - Just the eyes, keep the face. There you go. Listen, she's... I mean, you know her situation, right? Guys... It would be amazing if you could give us your phone number. Is this for you or is this for her? It's for her, just write it down. You know, sir, stop resisting. - Come on. - Thank you so much. I really, really appreciate this. Seriously, I will have you and your whole family arrested. All right. You absolutely suck! - Thank you very much. - Are you serious? Hey, do you want us to run a background check on him, sweetie? No, I'm sure his number will be just fine. - [Skye laughs] - [Calvin] What? - What's so funny? - [Skye] Nothing. Skye, what's so funny? [Izzy] She packs a mean punch. Does it hurt? Uh, kinda, yeah. Oh. Here. Is that better? No, it hurts like hell. [both laugh] I still can't get over the fact that you work at an airport but you're afraid of flying. Well, we have some very important work down on the ground. Bet you've never unloaded the cargo hold. Only because the unions won't allow it. Otherwise, I'd be all up on those bags. I was sick of him lying to me, so I dumped him. And then this job came up, and thought "What the hell?" Change of scenery can't be all that bad. Get away from the ex, get to see the world. Sounds like a win-win for me. What about you? Do you think you'll ever go back to school? I don't know. Did you drop out because of... Sorry, I shouldn't have asked. No, no, look. I... Yeah? I made you something. Oh, wow. Thank you. What is it? It's the sacred ibis bird. The sacred what now? [chuckles] Sacred ibis bird. In ancient Egypt, it represented the god Thoth. When you die, Thoth would question you on your life and, if the scales were balanced, he'd say your heart was just and true. I love it. No one's ever made anything for me before. Thank you. I think Thoth would say a lot of good things about you. Is that all you got?

Great. You didn't tell your parents I punched you, did you? Did you? Did you?! [indistinct chatter] [Lucy] I can't get over the change in Calvin. What's your secret? Maybe I can try it on Frank. [both laugh] [Skye] Calvin's mom OK? He didn't tell you? Of course not. He had a sister who died. After that, she just shut down. That's so sad. I hope my parents will be able to cope. The way I see it, you have two options. You either get cancer or you never, ever tell her the truth. I can't keep lying to her. I don't know, Calvin. I mean, I like you for who you are, but what if Izzy only really likes you for your cancer? [laughs] OK. People really get off on that shit. OK, moving on. What's next on your list, eh? What adventure you gonna take me on? So there's this one thing, but it's kind of embarrassing. I don't think you could say anything to surprise me anymore, Skye. I've never made love. - [laughs] Your face! - Funny. So what do you say? Your place or mine? Skye... I hate to break it to you... but you can't wink. - Yes, I can. - You cannot wink. This wink you're doing with your tongue and your eyes, it's not a wink. Like, your tongue comes out, your eyes droop. It's unnecessary. It's like... [babbling] You OK? [Calvin] You don't need to involve the... This better not be a sex dungeon. That is in the basement. Calvin Lewis, as I live and breathe, I think you just made a joke. What do you think? It's a nice crib. It's for Frank and Lucy's baby. I'm almost finished. Wait. You made this? Calvin, it's beautiful. Wait, you made this? Well, my dad kinda got me into this when I was a kid. Helps me take my mind off things, you know? I love it. How about that sex dungeon? Are you sure it's OK for me to sleep here? [Calvin] As long as you're not afraid of heights. [grunts] [whispers] Calvin, are you awake? Maybe. - This way, this way. - Over here? - Yes, right. - God, where are you taking me? You'll see. It's just a bit further. Yeah, we've got this. [Calvin] Ooh, there's a weird echo. - Wait, where are we? - [Izzy] You'll see. Be patient. All will be revealed. - Oh, no peeking! - OK, OK. Watch your step. OK. You can open your eyes now. May I have your boarding pass? Straight ahead on your right. Flight attendant will be with you shortly. You know, there's no bathroom in this plane, in case you want to join the Mile High club. [Izzy] OK. [sensual moaning] Welcome aboard this flight from nowhere to nowhere. It's a pleasure to have you with us. Your comfort and safety are our primary concerns, so please pay close attention to the following useless information. Sir, if you could please return your seat to its upright position. To fasten your seatbelt, place that metal tip into the buckle and tighten the strap. If the cabin pressure should fall, panels above your seat will open, revealing oxygen masks. Reach up, pull that mask in close. Place it over your nose and mouth, and then secure it with the elastic band. Place the vest over your head and fasten the straps to the front of the vest. [sensual gasp] Thank you for not flying with us. We hope you enjoy your date. [whispers] Julian. - Oh, oh, yeah. - Yeah, you need, there you go. That was awesome. Thank you. That was... terrifying. [Izzy laughs] [low-tempo pop song plays on phone] [laughs] I'm sorry that the dining experience isn't 100% authentic. It was hard enough bribing Julian without getting the caterers involved. OK, I'm just amazed that you went through so much trouble. I wanted you to see what I do. You know, you guys can apply for last minute cancellation and you should really take advantage of that. I think you're forgetting about my whole heights issue. I would make sure you had a good flight. Do you think you're gonna stay in New York? For a while, sure. I mean, where I'm from, can't go two steps without everybody being in your business. - That sounds familiar. - Mm. Yeah, I can't imagine. Moving back in with my parents, we'd probably kill each other. Don't get me wrong, I love them, but... Oh, it's not that bad. I mean, with work and Skye, I'm hardly there, so... She means a lot to you. I think I would fall apart if I was in her shoes. Didn't think you'd show. Come. I don't know where she gets the strength. Well, she's not as strong as she looks. Well, it's a good thing she has you then.

I'm glad that you brought it up because, honestly... When I moved here, the last thing I was thinking about was meeting somebody and I know that we've never talked about it. I didn't want to pry, but... I like you, Calvin. And before this goes any further... I need to know. I don't have cancer. I never did. [water drips] [Izzy] Why would you lie about that? I can explain. You weren't supposed to be that guy. [knocking] [door opens] Son. Are you up? - It's been days. - I'm sick. No, you're not. Well, I can't keep covering for you at work. [Calvin] Then I'll quit. [sighs] Not this time. I've already watched somebody I love give up on life and I'm not gonna do it again. You wanna throw it all away, fine. You do it somewhere else. - I'll help you pack. - Dad. Dad, look, I'm getting up. I'm sorry. [Bob sighs] Listen, son... no one deserves to start their life the way you did. But at least you got a start. Do something with it. Anything. I gotta get your mother's prescription filled.. [knocking] Hey. Hey. Sorry I didn't call sooner. So Izzy has a cancer fetish after all. I missed you. - Yeah, yeah. - [Calvin] I did. Really? Like on a scale of one to ten? Your mom says you've been in here for days. I think I'm just gonna lay here and lick my wounds until the end of time. I see that kid again, I swear to God... No, it wasn't his fault. I wanted it. I just... didn't think it would be so quick. I mean, he looks like he knows what he's doing but... OK, yeah. No, I don't need the details. Come on. Let's get you out of here, I want to show you something. Keep it in your pants, Calvin. [clears throat] It's important. Come on. [Skye] You didn't dig me a grave, did you? I mean, I know I went AWOL for a few days but still. [Calvin] It's my twin sister. We were in a car accident when I was eight years old. It was my mom driving. It wasn't her fault but... Why didn't you tell me? It's not something we really talk about. You know, I think it would have been easier on my mom if we both died. Don't say that. I'm like a constant reminder. Birthdays must have sucked. I haven't had one since then. What? Would have been too hard on my mom. Everyone deserves a birthday. Close your eyes. Why? Just close 'em. OK, now open them. Happy birthday, Calvin. [laughs] Come on, let's go. She looks like you. I mean, a better-looking version, like, way... OK, yeah, yeah. What was college like? Well, I dropped out after one semester, so... Why do you ask? Just been thinking about all the stuff I won't get to do. Was it fun? I didn't really... fit in. Ooh, shocker. I mean, I didn't intend on staying home this long. But you just kinda get sucked in, you know? Everything's so... familiar. [clears throat] What's this? This is... was my symptoms journal. I've been keeping one since I was a kid. - Why? - I don't know. I guess I always kinda had this feeling I was gonna die. Hate to break it to ya. At college, I kept having these panic attacks, like, all the time. I... I didn't drop out. I flunked, couldn't handle it. Yeah. Anyway, reason I'm showing you the journal is that I have stopped. Thanks to you. I made a new one. When I started going to support groups, everyone had the same list. I wanted to be different, so I did a bunch of stuff that no one's ever gonna remember. But I don't have much time left, so... I don't want to waste any more of it doing dumb shit. Don't talk like that. - [Skye] Like what? - Like you're not gonna make it. I'm going to the powder room, give me 50 bucks. Breakfast at Tiffany's. Oh, don't tell me. Calvin Lewis, you have a lot of living to do. [phone buzzing] Hey, Frank. What's up? No. Really? OK. Oh, my God. Yeah. Hey, Lucy. OK, yeah, I'll see you in a bit. Amazing. OK. OK. Bye-bye. [thuds] - [woman] Oh, my God! Are you OK? - Skye, Skye! [no audio] Any change? No. I'm sorry about this morning. I needed to hear it. I think I'm gonna try and find my own place. You don't have to move out. I know. It's a girl. [knocking] Did she wake up? Just for a few minutes. He's her favorite. Will you sit with her for a minute? - I could use some air. - Of course. Skye. Hey. [weakly] Calvin. No, no, no, don't do that. Cute wink. I've been practicing. [cat meows on TV] It's that damn cat scene. [knocking] Can we come in? Oh, my God, you have a baby. Yes, we do. [laughs] Do you wanna hold her? Does she have a name? This is Amber. Least you could do was name the kid after me. Well, um, Lucy and I were talking and it would mean a lot to us if you would both do us the honor of being Amber's godparents. You do know I'm not long for this world, right? We couldn't think of a better role model for our daughter. [Frank] She's gonna hear all about you, I promise you that. [Skye] Maybe just the good stuff. [Frank] What do you say, Cal? Cal. [Calvin gasps] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK. It's OK, I got you, I got you, I got you. It's OK, it's OK. I got you. Hey, hey, hey. You good? You good? - [breathing heavily] - Take a breath, come on. Let's go back inside. No. Don't do that. I can't watch her die. This isn't about you, OK? And what you think you can or can't do. This is about her. And she needs you in her corner right now. All right?

For real this time. It's perfect. Do you wanna try it out? Not just yet. [sobs] So what are you gonna do about Izzy? - Skye... - Don't "Skye" me. Being a wuss got you into this mess. Well, being a wuss and meeting me. But if you're gonna dig yourself out of it, you're gonna have to do it alone. I'm not sure what's on the other side of this, but... wouldn't bank on having me around to help. [Mrs. Aitken] Stay. Join us. So, guess now we just wait. I have to say, thought once I'd made up with Ashley and the girls... and once I put in a good word for Calvin with Izzy... once I told you guys how much I love you... I really thought they'd come for me. Well, maybe they're still waiting. Yeah. Maybe they're having second thoughts. What do you think, Calvin? Think they're having second thoughts? Maybe. Yeah. Maybe.
