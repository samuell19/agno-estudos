- And that, in a nutshell, is criminal psychology. So, after all that, who thinks it sounds boring? Really? Well, as criminal psychologists, we're on the ground floor. I mean sure detectives and lawyers and science, well I mean pretty much everyone gets more credit than us, but we're the ones who get to decide whether a suspect stands trial or walks free. Or whether or not a witness' testimony is taken as fact or as fiction. It's pretty neat, huh? Wow, tough crowd. Okay well how 'bout murder? Oo, you like that stuff. That's exciting, right? Well, basically using our minds, we can help determine whether someone is innocent or guilty. - What if you're wrong? - Good question from the girl I have never met. Look, we're always working to adopt a greater understanding of the human mind. And that said, it's not an exact science. So really, the best we can do is strive to minimize the possibility of being wrong. Okay. Well, that about does it for me. There's pamphlets at the front if you have any more questions. - Okay, wake up people. Let's show our thanks to Dr. Carter for taking the time to come speak to us today. Thanks. That's like winning the world series around here. You really got through to them. - Well high school students are not known for their attention spans. So I'll take it. - You're the psychologist. - You know, I wish you'd at least let me get the groceries. - I am supposed to try to be more independent, remember? - Yeah, I know, but that doesn't mean I still can't help. - If I can't even pick up a few groceries, how am I supposed to stop a mugger? Or a boy with poor manners? - With your keen intellect. - Then hopefully I'm adopted. - Oh very funny. Very funny. - How's the road? - A bit slick. Why? What are you trying to say? - Just making conversation. - Ah, sure yeah. Making conversation. - Want me to drive? - Maybe next time. Sloan, it wasn't my idea to go away this weekend. I wish I coulda said no. - It's all good, Dad. - I'm not really sure that you're ready to be alone. - I have to do it sometime. Like Pacino in Scent of a Woman. - I've never seen it. - Me neither. Look, it's okay. I know you have to work. - Look, I just want it on the record if you need anything, I'm just a phone call away. - Consider it recorded. - Well I mean it, anything at all. - When we run out of booze and weed you'll be the first to know. - Just promise me. I promise. - Well it looks your friends are here. Tobey's still driving that piece of shit. Sloan! - Hey Mika. I missed you so much. - Squeeze any harder and I'll go blind. - Shut up. - I can hear you chewing, Toby. - Hi Sloan! Creepy place you got here Dr. C. You ever think of renovating? - Toby, help yourself to anything. You find your room okay? - No, not yet. - Go on upstairs, I'll be up in a sec. - Okay. I'm so excited to see you. Ready? Wanna get these bags? Yep. - How does she seem to you? - I don't know, I don't have Sloan sensory perception like you. - She seems kinda distant. - It's a lonely life up here. - Yeah, I don't doubt that. But I don't think it's it, you know maybe we don't talk enough. - Well if you called her anymore you'd be flagged by the NSA. - What does that even mean? - I don't know. It's topical. - Yeah this is weird. - What? - This is the first time Dr. Carter has let us stay in the same room at the same time. I just think it's ironic timing. - Now that you mention it, thank you for mentioning it. - Tell me you weren't smoking out there. - No problem. - I'm gonna miss you. - It's a weekend, Dad. - I know. Tom should be here around seven. - Can't wait. Dad. - Okay, okay. I'm going. - Don't worry Mr. Carter, she's in good hands. - I know. - Is everyone crying right now? So what now? - Let's go for a walk. - I was thinking sitting. - Oh come on, it's been forever. Let's go tour the Carter estate. This is so beautiful. - Yeah, during the day. - Yeah, we all know you shit yourself when the sun goes down. - Hey, I haven't shit my pants in nearly three years, thank you very much. - I walk down here a lot. - Isn't it hard to get around? - Shut up Tobey. - What, what'd I do? - I mean I've been coming down here since I was a kid. Dad's not really too big on changing it. Watch your head. Thanks. So give me some dirt. - School's school. Class, library, repeat. Nothing too exciting to report. - I've seen movies too. The whole world is using kid gloves. I mean can you guys give me a break? - We just wish you were there, is all. - I know the feeling. - You'll get there. - I know. But for now it's just me and my forest. Is this a burial ground of some sort? Just a forest, man. - No, this is where farmers go to die. - Let's check out the cabin. - It's getting kinda dark, isn't it? What are we waiting for? Solid. What does your dad do in here? - Hide out, I guess. Listen to music, read books. - God I hope I stay young. - Too late. - So who's this guy who's coming here tonight? - Tom. He's a student of my dad's. - Isn't it kinda weird that he's staying when your dad's not here? - I don't know. He's just passing through. My dad likes him. - Well maybe he'll be cute. - Maybe. - Maybe he'll be horrifying looking. - Maybe you'd be into that. - Maybe fuck you. - Be sure to let me know either way, Toby. She's gonna find out eventually. Sloan's got enough on her plate. - Well she doesn't need you to mother her. - What she needs is just a fun weekend with us. - So should we make animalistic love making sounds tonight? Is that part of charade? - Well can we just get through this weekend and figure our stuff out after? - So who's taking the floor? - Are you kidding? - I don't know how Chris Martin and Gwyneth do it. - Do what? - You know stay consciously uncoupled. Wait for the kids. Ah, apple. You guys underestimate me. - I believe in you. - I really think I can help with this reno. Didn't I ace shop class? - In grade nine. - The record stands. - What'd you make again? - A lamp. - It looked like a dick. - It was erotic, yes. Some would call it avant garde. - What's avant garde mean? - It's French. Means really good. - What's wrong? - You didn't hear that? - No, hear what? - I always thought of you as a good listener. - That must be our guest. You want backup? No, I got it. - Hi, are you Sloan? - Hey Tom. - Yeah hi, I'm Tom. - My dad told me you were coming. Come on in. - Thank you, I appreciate it. - Everyone, meet Tom. - Hi, I'm Mika. - Mika, it's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Sorry man, I'm Tom. - Toby. What'd you walk? Didn't hear a car. - No, I hitched a ride from the bus stop. They dropped me at the laneway. - Well we could've picked you up. - You know I didn't wanna be more trouble than I needed to be. Okay, look guys, I'm not gonna get in your way. Okay I'm here tonight, I'm gone first thing tomorrow morning, I promise. - No, you're right on time. We're about to make dinner. - I, I don't mind grabbing some take out. - Oh nobody delivers this far. We can forage. - My dad would have a shit if he found out we didn't feed you. - And he takes weird shits. - Can I help with something? - No, we got it. Go on upstairs. First door on the right. - Great. - Want me to show you? - I think I can manage, thanks. - I like him. - Yeah, he's alright. - Seems kinda square though, right? - Tom? - Yeah. Hey, I'm just looking at your old family photos. - Sorry to hear that. - No, you were a cute kid. - My dad has trained you well. - Oh he's had a big impact on my life. More than I can tell you. - Glad you're a fan. - I'm serious. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be where I am. I wouldn't be here. - He likes to say that the job is the reward. - I don't doubt that. He never mentioned your condition. - It's true. I'm allergic to cats. - I'm sorry if I'm overstepping. - It's fine. He's overprotective. When he found out he had to work this weekend it was like he was leaving a toddler. - Can I ask what happened? - Sure. - What happened? - Got rid of the cat. - Okay. So that's how you guys met? - Yes, some bully was trying to mess with us in grade four and Toby over here was our savior. - Except he got the shit kicked out of him. - Hey, I got a few good shots in. - You called one of them lima bean. - Yeah and I hated lima beans. So that was cruel. - So wait, how long you two been together? - Three years. - Wow. And you, Sloan, you seeing anyone? - Not at the moment. - So how do you know Sloan's dad? - The great Dr. Carter. I actually studied under him for my Masters. But he was kind enough to let me help him out with a couple of cases. - Cool. Anything creepy we would've heard of? - You've probably heard of Laura Jones. - No shit. You were on the Jones case? - Who is that? - The baby butcher! She was like this housewife that went nuts one day. Killed a couple of kids; gruesome shit. She was like just a mom. - You worked on that? - Yeah, just a little bit of help. Mostly filing paperwork and stuff, but it was a big one. Learned a lot. - Well thank you for keeping our streets safe from crazy housewives. - My pleasure. But again, it was mostly just behind the scenes stuff. - We should probably get going. We're headed to a party if you'd like to come. - Full disclosure it's full of locals. No thank you, I should really stop intruding on you guys. You go ahead. I'll stay here and clean up. - Fuck you pal. - Okay make the apple. There you go. - Don't overdo it. - What happened to trust, huh? - That's what you said before prom and you made me look like a spice girl. - Hey, hottest spice girl ever, thank you very much. - That's true. - I'm happy we're finally going out together again. - Yeah, it's been a while. - Just no whiskey. - No whiskey. - Okay? Yeah, that was bad. You puke. Smile. - Hey man. - I don't know what's taking them so long. - You're not gonna freshen up? - Oh hell no man. Oh natural for the Tobster. Or for the, for me. - Yeah. So tell me about yourself. What do you, what are you studying? - Political science. - Political, wow. Where's that gonna take you? - I don't know. Political scientist? - So you musta spent a lotta time here growing up. - Sure did. - Are you close with Sloan's dad? - With the Doc? Hell yeah man, I'm like his second son. - I thought Sloan was an only child. - Right. I mean, if he had another son. - Right. It's weird being here. You know like someone could have such a big impact on your life but you don't really know who they are until you set foot into their house. - Can I ask you a question about the Jones case? Yeah, fire away. - Why did you think she did it? - What makes you so sure she did it? - Shut up. - I'm just saying. I don't know, they had educated guesses. That's what they had. But with the hysteria of the media, I don't know it seemed like the pitchforks were out. - Right. - Food for thought. - I bet you meet a lotta kooks in your line of work. - There are some funny people out there. - I hear ya man. Tender, am I right? - Don't wink at me. Watch your step. - Thanks. It's chilly. - Great day to wear a skirt. - It's not so bad. - Yeah, you gotta wear a jean jacket all year long. Acclimatize that way. - No thanks. I'll take the back. - Same. - Are you shitting me? Man. - We're gonna have to get in the other side. - Hang on, let me do it. There you go. - Alright. - Feel like a god damn Uber driver. Party! Take us to the party, yeah! - Here. You want me to feed it to you, or you got it? Sorry, I'm just super high. This good shit's fucking me up. Here. - Holy fuck, what was that? - What was what? - I saw something. - I didn't. - Well I did. Who the fuck would be walking around here at night? - Maybe it was a deer. - Or a coyote. - Are we having an out of body experience? - No, it looked like a girl. I didn't like it. - Toby's high. - Toby's high. - Toby! Hi. You good? Watch your step. Whoo hoo! - Hey, do you remember me? I'm Willie. It's Willie. - Got it. - After the few wine bottles. Back on the... - Any more girls coming by? - You know me. I like to roll with as many ladies as I can. - Well you've come to the right spot. - Oh I have? I'm guessing so. ¶ Never seem to fit your mold ¶ ¶ But baby I'm okay ¶ Hey. - Hey you. - Hey. Have you seen Sloan? - Sloan, I don't know a Sloan. - Oh she's about yea high, wears glasses. - Oh, Sloan. I haven't seen her. - Are you having fun? - This town seems smaller than I remember. - Smaller than your ego? - You go away to school and your perspective just changes, you know? - Come on, these people aren't that bad. Most of them. - You going in the pool? - Oh hell no. I have seen way too much nasty shit going down to ever wanna go in that. - Oh I want details. - You were a part of it. Grade nine. - Coolers. - Yeah. - Honestly, it has got to be amazing that you're wearing sunglasses all the time. Like ugh, the amount of time it saves on makeup. Yeah, it's lucky. - Well here we are with all the nerdy kids. - You are the nerdy kid. - Oh I'm the nerdy kid am I? - I thought you knew me. You don't know me at all. - I thought so too. Come on, you don't see Sloan complaining. - Like if you need anything, like anything, I am here for you. You, you probably can't tell, but like I mean it. - If anything I'm a jock. These kids are intimidated by me, look at 'em. Yep, I'm gonna regret all those lunchtime wedgies I gave over the years. I'm a sick man, Mika. - We can agree on one thing. You are sick. I'm gonna go find Sloan. - Okay. I'm gonna wrestle up some lunch money. - Where were you? - Shit, you scared the shit outta me. - Sloan, what's wrong? - This party's bumming me out. I feel like I'm being watched. - Alright. Now let's get outta here. Okay? - Yeah. - Alright. Watch your step. Careful. Helpful this time. Guys, why's the door open? That's weird. - What is that? - What? This red stuff. - Looks like blood. - Bird probably hit the window. It happens. - Where's the bird then? I don't understand the country. Anyways, where's our hero? Tom? - Hey, how was the party? - Fun. - Nice shirt, bro. - Yeah, I was just about to take a shower. But that can wait if anybody feels like a nightcap. Yeah I gotta be honest, I'm not really a lime guy. More like a... - I think I'm tipsy. Actually I think I have alcohol poisoning. - Sure thing. - So what are you making next? - Incarcerations. - Incarcerations. Okay and why do you call them that? - I do not have a good answer for that, actually. - Alright. Two incarcerations coming right up. - Okay that's not how you're supposed to shake it. - Yes it is. I saw a YouTube video. Toby, where's your phone? - Dead, sorry. - Just, stop. - That's you do it. - Up top, nice and easy. - That's some French way that I don't even... - Toby, what's wrong man? - What? Oh. These two seem to be getting along fine. - Don't be jealous. - Sloan there's something I gotta tell you about Mika and I. You're pregnant? - No, I. - You know you can always talk to me, Toby. - We're just, going through a rough patch. More like an expansive land than a patch. - Thought something was up. - Yeah? - Yeah blindness gives you ESP. Look, you guys just seem off. - Well I am naturally uptight. - You guys gotta tell me the shit man. - Yeah. But I've been spending more time watching breakfast television than I have with my professors. So, if you wanna talk. - You know I don't even know if I wanna go to school. - Yeah, join the club. - And now, more booze? Pronto! - My dad keeps some in the garage. I'll be right back. Sloan. - Hello? - All I'm saying is that you work enough cases and eventually you get, I don't wanna say desensitized. But you distance yourself. It doesn't affect people in my profession. Or at least no one I'm familiar with. - I don't get it. Sounds like a lotta pressure. - You would think so. - I don't know, stuff happens in life. Eventually you adapt. You have to. - Is that that whole lemons and lemonade crap? - Yeah, not necessarily lemonade, but something. - Lemonade's the only thing I can make from lemons. Arnold Palmers. - You're talking about making the best of a tough situation. - Yeah. Why not? - That's a good notion but it's easier said than done. - True. - Well take Dr. Carter for instance. Does he bring his job home with him? - If you mean while he's gone twice a day. Then yep. - Speaking of which, I'm gonna go check on the grass. - Lemon water. I can't cook. - So you guys are best friends. - She's our girl, yeah. - And you look out for her. - We try to. As best as we can, yeah. - Mika! Mika! Mika! - Sloan! Sloan get away from there. - Jees, sweet Mary and Joseph. - Get inside, inside. Should we call 911 or something? - Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it. We have an emergency. There is a body. - Are you okay? - No, are you? We don't know what's going on. - Wait, no. - Neither am I. There's a body out there. A body! - Okay, thanks. Cops are on their way. They say we should sit tight. - Okay. - Is that door locked? - I don't know. So what, we just stay here? - No, I say we get away from that guy quick. - He's helping. - When there's a guy hanging, there's blood on the deck. And the fucking door's open. He was the only one here. - No, no, we're staying here. Sloan, tell him. - I don't know. - Okay, doors are locked. You guys okay? - I'm gonna check upstairs. - No, no no, I got it. - You sure? - Mostly. - Okay. You never know. - Thanks. You are John McClane, you are Jason Bourne. You are Sarah Connor. - I got your back, okay? - I know. - I'm gonna check the windows. - Be careful. I felt it. - I'm sorry. - Is it my dad? - Oh god, no no Sloan. We don't know that person. - I had a feeling it wasn't, but... - No, he's fine, you're fine. We're all fine. - Should we cut it down? It's a fucked up way to go. - Oh no, I hear you and you're right. But we can't go out there. We don't know what's there. Okay, do you hear me? We're staying here. - Ah screw it. - Toby. Girls were worried. - Yeah, yeah, all good. Nobody up here. - Good. I'll see ya downstairs. - Everything's okay up here. It's clear. - You guys where are the cops, huh? - We're in the middle of nowhere. The Sheriff's probably drunk. - Okay am I the only one who thinks we should get the hell out of here? - Toby, we don't know what's out there. - Well we know there's flesh piñata out hanging around. - What, you wanna be strung up beside it? - Mika's right. We should stay put. - Well it's worth a try, isn't it? We may not have time to stop whatever's happening out there. We may not be able to defend ourselves. - Why not? - Well no offense, but we're two liberal arts majors, a freaking psychologist's assistant and a-- - Blind girl. - Look, if I can get to the car we can get the fuck out of here and let the cops clean up whatever this is. - Toby, please. - Look, I can do this. I want to do this. - Okay. Yeah, I'll watch out the window. As soon as you get the car started I'll bring everyone out. - Thanks. Just hang around. I don't know, sorry. Okay. Here we go. Fucking come on. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh come on. Oh. Shit! Oh god. Oh fuck. Jesus. - What, what's wrong? Oh shit. Oh fuck. - You guys. - I got him. Get a towel. - What happened? It's my leg. - What about the car? - It's dead. It's dead. And there's someone out there. - Who? - Some woman psycho. She was chasing me and then she vanished. I saw her too. - Ah fuck. Oh God it hurts. It's okay. God. Thank you. Guys. - Oh God it hurts. I think these are pain killers. - Oh please tell me it's office strength. - I don't know, my dad uses it for work. - He needs to lie down. His leg is bad. - Alright, come on. Easy, easy, easy, easy. Let's get you upstairs, okay? You got him? I got him Mika, go ahead. - Call David Carter. You've reached Dr. Carter. I'm unable to take your call, so please leave a message after the tone. - Dad? We're in trouble. Call me back please. - You guys are strong. - Okay. I got him, I got him. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Watch his leg, please. - Oh wow, that's so nice. Like a little cloud. - You'll be fine. They'll send an ambulance. - You okay? - I'm gonna be just fine. Mika. - Let's go, let's go. - Bye guys. - Go check on her. - Sloan, are you okay? Is she gone? She's not there. - What? - Hey, there's no one there. She'll be back. - Sloan can you think of any reason why someone would wanna hurt you? - I don't know. - Made you some tea. - Thanks. - The cops should be here any second. What's taking so long? - I don't know. - I, I just-- - Do you wanna call your dad? - I tried. - We're gonna make it through this. - Do you remember that time I went skiing and hit my head? You helped me down, said I was gonna be okay. That I might have a big head, but that it was gonna be okay. You're gonna be fine. You might have a limp though. - We need to do something. - There's nothing we can do right now. - Well I can't just sit here and do nothing. - I understand. When I was younger I had something bad happen to me. And I didn't think that there was anything I could do about it. - What did you do? - Found a way. I kept fighting. - You guys, Toby's really hurt. We have to move him. - I'll call the cops again. - Toby! Toby. - What is it? What's happening? He's bleeding. - I'm going after her. Here, pressure. Okay, keep your hand there. I know you're out here. - Wish we had the fucking whiskey right now. - Right? I promised your dad I'd take care of you. - Mika, you don't have to. That was the front door. - I'll get it. No, don't. - Just let me go. Tom? Mom? - It's... Yeah. It's your mom. - Cool sunglasses, Mom. - Thanks. Toby? I want you to know I think you'd do a really good job of renovating this place. - That's what I'm saying. I'm really good with a hammer. Tom? - Mom? - Yeah? - There's a bad person here. - Yeah. - I don't like her. - Neither do I. - Sloan, stay away. - Tell me what's going on. - Sloan, run! - Sloan run! - Don't go, honey. Nice night, isn't it? - No. Just leave us alone. - I can't do that. It's too much fun. - What do you want from us? - I'm not complicated. You got two options, kiddo. Either you come here or I go back in there and I carve your friend's eyes out. Okay, come on. Come on, honey. Come here honey. Come on. Come on, it's okay. Come on. Come on, that's it. Come on. Come here. It's okay. Oops. There you go. That's better. Shh. Who are you? - I'm just a friend. - Where's Mika? - Who's? Oh. She's your friend. Nice girl. Too much makeup. She had an accident. You should really see it. Oh. This would be more fun if your eyes worked. I'm very beautiful, by the way. Big tits. What is your world like? Hmm? Is it scary? Is it black? - Fuck you. - Do you recall the color red? Do you remember what blood looks like? It's okay, I'll talk you through it. I'm a god damn hero. - Toby. So, who's she? - I don't know. - Where's Mika? - Listen to me, we gotta get outta here. - Yeah, that'd be nice. I think I'm hurt really bad. Here. Okay, hold on. Let's go. - Hi. - Tom? - Is she dead? - I think so. - Bill. - She just call you Bill? - Yeah. I think we lost Toby. - Who are you? - I'm Tom. - No, you're not. - No? Okay. I'm not Tom. Well, Tom's probably hanging around somewhere. Sloan, hey, hey, hey. Relax, relax. Just sit. Sit. Okay. Now don't fucking move. Okay? Okay. I'm, I'm sorry that you had to see me do that. Hear me do that. It has been very hard to stay politically correct with all this business going on. Can I just say that? I'm talking about your glasses, by the way. I just, I really wish that she would've finished the job by now. I thought she would. It's tough to find good help nowadays. Affirmative action, right? You know all night it has taken every ounce of self restraint that I possess to keep from calling you Stevie Wonder. May I? There you go. You have very pretty eyes, Sloan. - Someone will be here soon. - Yeah, I think that we should start over, you and me. I'm Bill. - You don't know my dad. - Yes and no. I've never actually formally met the guy. You know in the flesh so to speak. But I, I know of him. I know of him very fucking well. I wasn't lying before. Your dad, he's very good at what he does. - You killed my friends. - I got you on a technicality there because I didn't kill your friends. You know she. Okay, I killed Toby. That's one. You got me, congratulations. I'm sorry. Just! Just relax. We're just talking. We're just talking. - What do you want? - Your mom, she's dead, right? Mine is too. I mean not technically but she might as well be. See, she's gone away. And your dad was the one who booked her plane up the river. Her boat. Is it down the river? - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about Laura Jones. Or as your dead friend Toby here so crassly referred to her, the baby butcher. That's my mom. - She was a murderer. - No fucking proof! There was no fucking proof! My mother was railroaded by a corrupt system looking for anyone to take the fall. They pick out the nearest piece of trash and presto, it's case closed. And your dad, the fucking lap dog, his bullshit evaluation tipped the scales. - How could you know-- - How could he? I think his actions have consequences, Sloan. And we've all gotta feel them. - Maybe she was a psycho, just like you. - You don't talk about my mother. You don't know my mother. - You won't find my dad. - I wouldn't be so sure. I'm anything if not resourceful. But there's one thing before I bow out. I want you to tell me how you lost your sight. - Why? - Curious. - Will you let me go if I tell you? - Yeah, yeah, maybe. - I watched too much television. Crossed my eyes too much. Took a look at your ugly face one day and it was like-- I'm not gonna give you what you want. I'm not scared of you, mama's boy. - You should be, you should be. - Wanna keep blaming everyone else for your problems? You and your crazy bitch mom can go fucking-- - You know, I think we're just about done talking. Well that was loud. You gotta pull it. - Call David Carter. Dad? - Sloan? How is the family reunion? For what it's worth, I'm sorry. I really wish we coulda had this place to ourselves. Sloan! I don't wanna hurt you. Okay, I mean I wanna kill you but that doesn't mean that I wanna hurt you. So just put, just put the hammer down. So just put the hammer down, okay? Okay, just put down the hammer. Good girl. Good. I actually might hurt you a little bit. I might hurt you a little-- Welcome back to solitary night, on KFMT. I'm your host Derrick Pants. That was Sebastian Kambu with a 1957 classic, Feeling Lucky. Up next we have another standard. But first I'd like to extend a special thank you to all our listeners who are now begging for their love. So whether you're out there, alone or two, cozying up to a lover or just can't seem to get any shut eye, this one goes out to you. I wish you could see the expression on my face right now. - Can you see the expression on my face, mother fucker? - Stop!
