You have some fire ? Lord! What is it? Are you waiting for the bus to Los Angeles? That's why I'm here. A good place to disappear. As they say. Hey ! Does it tell you to share a bit of Christmas spirit? It warms you inside when it's cold outside. I just want to give you something to drink. We are Christmas Eve, good God. You do not want to come and sit down? I will not send you an invitation anyway. I will not shout. Nobody can hear you. Oh Winston! Look how cute you are with your Christmas present. You are a good boy. Are not we both good? Oh, lord ... ..seems to be an animal attack ... ..though the investigation suspects that it is a homicide. A detailed analysis of this murder has a strange similarity to two others. The first in Florida and the second in Texas ... A 16 year old girl was found on October 23rd by two police officers ... The wounds in each case are identical and the three women were all pregnant. The police can not establish a motive and have no suspects. Hello? Oh ! Carla! I was just watching your brother on TV. I have hardly heard from you since you were in New York. I do not understand. I know but... ... I guess, yes. How? Oh yes, he arrived yesterday! Now ? Alright, wait a minute! ... I spoke recently with Lieutenant Calvin Hendricks. There have been no incidents in an urban area and there is no indication that this may change. So no one is threatened by this so-called grizzly bear if he stays near his home? Oh Carla! They are magnificent. Just what I needed. Thank you darling. Oh, already? We are very concerned about all this and we will keep you informed of developments. - Here Clay Dwyer. To you. - Yes... Merry Christmas to you too, darling. Bye ! The oldest of the city celebrates 100 years today. When asked for the key to her longevity, she answers "you are what you eat". I warn you: if you're still ruined I bring everything back to the store. No, I did not spend too much and you will not bring anything back. Oh, Emily! - The grandmother's earrings. - I guess I should have given them to Carla but I could not handle it. I can not believe. Thank you m'man. No way you bring it back. Okay, let's go for the final bouquet. What does it mean ? - We kept the best for the end. - Come on, you've already done too much. To tell the truth, it's also a gift for both of us. Well... ? - Well what? - Where is he ? - I can not believe you do not see him. - In a few months she will not be able to miss it. You're kidding. - You'll be grandmother. - I was wondering when was coming this day. It still does not tell you to drop this story of room for rent and make it a nursery. Do not start Clay, I will not change my mind. I need money as much as companionship. Too bad. Sorry Junior, no room at mamie's! Oh, you're going to have a baby! So... When are you going to get married? - Yes ? - Hello. My name is Nestor Duvalier. A friend told me he saw a sign at your window about a room to rent. - I hope she is always available. - Yes, of course she is available. I am Emily Dwyer. Do you want to see the room? - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's nothing Emily. I am sure she will be perfect. I am looking for a quiet little place that I could consider as my home. So welcome home Nestor. I beg you, come in. Something is burning. Oh, Nestor! Come in and sit down. I have a surprise for you. - Emily. Something is burning. - Oh ! The bread ! It is a little overcooked but it will be fine. What is going on ? I prepared a nice little dinner. I told you I was dying outside. But it's cold outside! I'm still eating outside. I'm sure you'll find something you like in what I've prepared. There are vegetables if you do not eat meat. It's not that. And you will love the specialty of the house. - The roast on the Dwyer. - Emily, please, no. Just a bite. It's irresistible. Taste. - Emily. - You will not refuse. No ! I'm sorry, I did not want to ... You should not have done that. Clay Dwyer! I'm calling about your mother. I am Mr. Hernandez from Mc Intyre Butcher Shop. I put meat aside for your mother's dog every Tuesday. I remember. How are you, Mr. Hernandez? Emily did not come today and she always calls when she has an impediment. You tried to call him? Nobody's answering. I hope everything is okay. Yes, I'm sure Mr Hernandez. I'll ask him to call you. Thank you for worrying. All right, darling? I'm sure it's nothing. - That's wonderful. - Thank you. - The phone seems unplugged. - Sorry ? Mom never disconnects him. - And if we went for a ride? Would you like to ? - Of course. - Let's go. - Okay. Hello. Hi John. No, he's not here. Very well. I will give him your message. Very well. Bye. - What did he want? - You have to go to work. - It seems that your killer has decided to come to LA - Awesome. - There is someone ? - I'm from the electric company. I'm coming to your meter. What luck. I have an electrical problem and I can not solve it myself. I will give you a hand. I appreciate it enormously. What do you want ? My mother ... where is she? Oh, you must be Clay. I am Nestor. Yes I can imagine. What is going on ? What do you mean ? Oh, that's probably me. I did not think to turn on the light. M'man! She's sleeping, Clay. At 18:00? Your mother has been tired for a few days. What do you mean ? Why did not she call me? She did not want that to be known. She did not want to worry. I took care of her. - She could call. - Emily should not be able to talk to anyone. - You must be Alice. - Yes. Mummy? Nestor? It's Clay, m'man. - Clay ... what are you doing here? - I was worried about you, old crazy. Close the door, the light hurts my eyes. Of course. Sorry. It's much better ... thank you. Why did not you tell me you were sick? Nestor took care of me. - I did not want to worry. - That's what you did. Even Mr Hernandez was worried. Oh, my butcher. I completely forgot to call him. I know... I'm sorry darling. How do you feel ? I think I will survive. Nestor brought me ... ...what to eat. It did me a lot of good. Yes, I was probably a little too worried, excuse me. I'll let you sleep. Do not go. I already feel much better. Okay, just warn me when you get back. Alice ... is down with Nestor? - Of course why ? - You better tell him I'm fine ... ... and that I will go down a moment. Okay. - Are you sure that's okay? - Yes go ahead ! Damn it ! But what ... Your mother told me the good news. He says he can hear the baby's heart beat. My condition gave me a very developed hearing. Do not blame me Clay. I have always had a soft spot for babies and future moms. I'm a little anxious Nestor, it's me who excuses me. You worried about your mother. How's Emily? She is a little weakened but ... ..but it's okay, she said she was coming down. I'm ready for my close-up, Mr DeMille. Emily! When we talk about the wolf. Take care of yourself and drink this tea. I'm sorry for worrying you. I'll try to go tomorrow, okay? - Good night. - Good night. Well done Emily. I will give everything for my children. You already did it. The discovery of the mutilated body of this woman gives us an idea of the brutality of the serial killer ... ... which is rife in Los Angeles. - Emily! I come. - What do I look like? - You're really good. You are ready ? Yes, the time to turn off that. I'm starving. Are you looking for company? Mounted. Monte! Not you ! She ! Right now ! I'll meet you at home, Nestor. Clay, please, slow down. Stop, you're crazy! I'm crazy? You just killed someone! Do not speak to me like that. I am still your mother. Always my mother? My mother has deliberately killed a man in an alley! There's enough to ask questions, do not you think? - Let me explain to you. - No, there is only one explanation. You are sick. You are sick and I will treat you. - Clay ... - And I'm going to kill that son of a bitch! Let me tell you what I know. Give me a few minutes to explain. All right, but do not think that will stop me from being treated. It's not that simple, Clay. Let's go home. Everything seems to be back in order. Here is a beautiful happy family again. - Kind of son of a bitch. - Clay! What did you do to my mother? You should be grateful that I did not do worse. Emily? I think your son would rather see you in the grave than in such a state. - Nestor, stop! - I'm just defending myself, Emily. I think your son is trying to hurt me. Oh, Clay. Your mother did not tell you? Nobody can hurt me. You are crazy. Your mother also does not suffer from human frailty anymore. You are crazy! I beg you Clay, do not annoy him. It was this crazy killer from the beginning. A logical explanation. You think I only need fresh meat and that I managed to persuade your mother to become a human flesh eater too? By hypnosis maybe. A flesh eater? Vampire, werewolf, ghoul ... it's the same thing. You really believe in that bullshit, right? Yes, and I even persuaded your mother. But it was not hypnosis. - Nestor! - You bastard ! It's been years since I had not had fun like that. - Clay. - Stay there, m'man. Remember, Mr. Reporter. You are talking about me... ... you talk about your mother. I would like to speak to Lieutenant Calvin Hendricks. - What do you think you're doing ? - Nestor, stop! - Ask your precious son what he is doing, Emily. - I was just trying to ask for help. Nestor, you promised. He was trying to call the police, not real kid? - I will not let you hurt him. - Too bad for you, old woman. Leave him alone! - I'll make sure your death is not too fast. - No ! And to say that he spoke of immortality ... My poor baby. - Clay, wake up. - Alice, what ... Honey, this is just a nightmare. Everything is fine. - What time is it ? - It's morning. You came out last night to see if your mother was okay. Oh yes ... mom. - Oh shit. - I woke up and you were not there. I called you but you did not answer. I was worried. I'm sorry, darling. Its good. Is everything alright ? What happened to your face? I fall in the stairs. Oh, poor boy ... How's Emily? Moderately last night but it must go now. She should see a doctor, Clay. - Yes, I know, but she's stubborn. - Tell him to come. Stoney is following me too. I do not think we can call him Stoney anymore. Oh that's right. Dr. William Coradoz. Where is Nestor? In fact, I think he's gone. He was not here yesterday. Bizarre. Oh shit, you have to go to work. They called you, they need you right now. It's the craziest story I've ever seen. There may be witnesses but it is unlikely. I will give more information after the preliminary autopsy. Are there any other witnesses? Have you seen anything? - Dwyer. - Lieutenant. Something is wrong ? No why ? No questions ? No questions? Just a little tired today. I imagine it's your business. Clay! Clay! Clay? You know what, darling? I sold paintings to a woman who would like to make an exhibition. And I bought the cradle of the baby. ..shit. Hi. - Hi to you too. - How do you feel ? I'm hungry. And angry. I have never been locked in my room until now. It's for your own good. I can take care of myself, thank you. You said you were hungry, that's good. What can I bring you? Nothing. - Mom, you have to eat. - I know that! But you will not let me eat, will you? Of course yes. You want to try to swallow something? - It's useless Clay. - You must try ! Please. Very well. I'm going to try. Okay. That's for you. That's what you prefer. I can not. I'm sorry. Tries. You said you were going to try. I am going to throw up. And now ? You know, I think it's okay. Yes OK. I love you too. Winston. Winston! Come here. Shit. - Excuse me. - Leave it alone, ma'am! I'm afraid of being lost. - Could you ... - The bus stop is there. You seem to need a good hot meal. Yes I'm hungry. So will you fuck! Kind of crazy old woman. She wanted to invite me to dinner. You can only crack grannies, Baxter. So move your ass and do your job or your first day in the service will also be your last. Yeah yeah yeah. I'm sick of it. Tired of 40 West Club. I should go back to the East sector. Damn, I'll fuck you! Fucking .... Hey, what are you? Have you ever seen anything? I think it could be that. Get ready to intervene. Hey, what do you want? What's going on, Baxter? Hey, it's good. Baxter, answer! Brothel! At all units, we go! Do not move ! Stay where you are! Good God ! Oh no, damn it! Hendricks, get back here! I have an old madwoman at my basques. Shit! Shit ! Looks like it comes from the roof! Go, have to go see! Do not force me to shoot you, ma'am. I am not joking. If someone has to go down it's going to be you. What... M'man! We do not move anymore! Lie down on the floor! - I did not do anything. - Right now ! - Leave it! - But Lieutenant ... - I told you to leave him, Daniel! What are you doing here? I followed police cars. An intuition ? - Yes, we can say that. - What did you see ? A man who fell from the roof. What else ? Nothing more. You will have to go to the police station anyway. It will be up to us to ask you questions to change. - Daniel! - Yes sir ! Inspect all roof accesses. And I want everyone to be asked three blocks around. Yes sir. Lieutenant, can I go now? I have to go take care of my mother, she is very sick. I'm afraid your mother should wait. We are waiting for you at the station. - But ... - Do not abuse Dwyer! I'm not in the mood ! Oh shit! I'm sorry, I ... I had to go there. You killed him. - How do you know ? - You killed a cop. Oh ... I did not kill him. He fell. I did not know he was a policeman. If it had been a tramp it would have been better? Perhaps... ..better. I do not want to argue with you. But I can stop you. Good night. You know, install bars downstairs and upstairs, it'll be good for you. Clay, is it necessary? You have a problem ? Do you want to pick it up for me? Take him quickly to the hospital. How many men will I find out there? I do not know. - I do not know how much ... - Stop it! I ... I knew for him. But I did not know he was out there. Go to your room. Right now. I finished Mr. Dwyer. Have a nice day. Hello. No, Carla is Clay. No, she does not feel too much on her plate right now. No, it's not much, just ... Dinner, yes. How are you? Yeah. Sorry to hear that Carla but let me go get her. I come again. - Carla on the phone. - Carla? I wonder what's wrong? Carla! What a surprise ! Oh, I'm fine! You react excessively. How are you darling ? Oh my dear... Really ? Oh, how sad! How sad, I'm sorry. Oh yes. Really ? - Hush! - Okay. - Enter. No ! - What are you doing ? - Winston bit Kathy but I think she has nothing. What are you doing here? Do not worry Kathy, it's nothing. Did not your parents ever tell you not to go to strangers? - And do not come back! - Honey, wait! You forget your money! What's your problem ? I'm going crazy. Why do not you go home and rest and worry about your mother? Emily? I do not understand, Clay told me that you were very sick. Oh, well ... Last night I was really not good. but it's better today. - What are you doing here Alice? John called again. He said you better bring your ass back to the coroner's office. I tried to call you in vain. At first you were busy then it did not answer anymore. You slept so peacefully, I did not want to be disturbed. Well, you should enjoy sleeping when you can ... ... because in a few months ... I'm going to take you home while mom is resting. - No, I appreciate his charming visit. - Mum! Clay, I'm fine. Well. I will not stay long. Honey, go work. I'll be back as soon as I can. Go ahead ! ... or something like that. - The van does not start, you have to take me. - Oh, great! You will come back to visit me later. Mom, you better go to bed. I will go up in a little while. I know you mom, you'll stay here and you'll be tired again. You do not want to relive that, do you? I will not take that risk. Rest well Emily. You treat me like a kind of alien monster. Did you really think that I had attacked this little girl? You were also scared for Alice and the baby, right? It was Nestor's preference, not mine. Why do not you believe me? Why do not you accept that you're changing and driving us all crazy? It will soon be dark. You better go. Or you will lose your job. The mutilated body found this morning is surely the last murder of a series ... ... that hurts the local police. Clay Dwyer is currently in the coroner's office. Clay. Thanks Marsha. The police will give the identity of the body found by two employees of the Royal Park. Police efforts to trap the killer have remained in vain and were saddened by the death of a police officer last night in the slums of Los Angeles. We determined the identity of the victim. Dr. William Coradoz, 53, living in Los Angeles. Oh no. Stoney. Shit. Fucking shit. We still have some points to develop and we just come back after this page of advertising. Stoney. I can not believe it. I had just spoken to him. What? I called him. About Emily. He said he was going to visit her. I have to go see man. You need to sleep. You are sinking. - Stop worrying about Emily. Call her. - Not her... I do not want to wake her up if she sleeps. - That does not make any sense. - Why do you contradict everything I say? Get out of this car. Stay out of this! Alice. I did not know it was Stoney. I swear. I did not recognize him. And I was so hungry Clay. You do not even imagine. I was locked up so long. He came here last night ... he was standing outside. He had come to help you. How could I have known? It could have been anyone. It could have been me. No. Not you. I would never have hurt you, Clay. Clay! Do not go ! I beg you, you must let me out. Clay, listen to me! I'm afraid ! Clay! I'm afraid. Let me get out of here! Shut up ! You will wake the neighbors! How can you do that? You have to help me ! I will not let you out. You do not have to do it. You can do it. - What? - Yes. You're smarter than me. You will never be worried. It is easy to find someone. I am your mother good god! We have not seen each other somewhere yet? Oh, are not you going to leave and break my heart again? You do not want to pay a drink to a lady? Beverly. What are you doing ? This gentleman wants to pay me a drink, right? You're supposed to be with me tonight. I will take as usual. Give me the same thing. How nice. How nice. My name is Beverly. And that... ... it's my hills. (Beverly Hills) What's your name, honey? Clay. Clay. That is a nice name. Very down to earth. Have you ever drunk ... ... a Tequila Tickler? First you take the lemon. Here. Good-bye. And salt. Then... Do not resist, honey. - Oh go Bev, please drop it. - Go shit, old man. Okay, this is the third house on the right. - Okay, here we are. - No, continue. Okay, we must be there, ma'am. Mrs ? It was a long walk. It'll cost you an extra. - I agree to pay double. - As long as there are no other surprises. This is what I want. My mother is upstairs. That was your mother? No way ! You call me a taxi right now, do you hear me? You did not choose the right girl, man. That's not what you think. Oh yeah, so what is it? My mother is confused. The last days have been difficult for her. Keep on going. She is obsessed with her daughter ... my sister. She has not seen it in years. She's crying all the time. So you want... ... that I go up and claim ... ... to be his daughter? Carla. Carla. And I'll have the 25 dollars? Absolutely. Oh okay. And then, piss off ... I too had a mother. I'll go tell him. I do not want a surprise. Satan, stupid! Second door on the right. The money first. Clara, is that it? Carla. It's the story of my life. Always pretend to be someone's mother or sister. Or the kid of someone. What now ? Sorry, I can not do that. I'm just doing what you paid me for. I should not have brought you here. Oh, it's nothing. - I can always make the money, you know. - Take the money and go away! Oh very good ! God, call me a cab, will you? Hello. Hi, m'man. It's Carolyn. I went home, Mom. Ah, just in time. I was wondering when you were going to wake up. Coffee ? How did you come out? You do not remember ? You really drank a lot last night. How did you come out? It was you who let me out. - Mum! - Really ! At four o'clock in the morning, I was not really well. Incredible that you do not remember. All of a sudden I felt like I could have released myself. - Where is the girl ? - The girl ? Oh, the one you brought back last night? You had to take her home. No. I called him a taxi. I told him ... ... to turn around. Alice. Alice. - It's against nature. - Carla! I had forgotten the absurdity of California subways. What are you doing here ? And why not hello. It still makes me happy to see you. I'm sorry darling. How are you ? I left her. I just booked a plane, pack my bags, did not say a word to him and went straight to mom's house. Or ? - Clay, he hit again. - I know. - We meet downstairs in 5 minutes. - You should send someone else. Whatever. - I'm serious. - Me too. You were a little to the west these last days and if I send someone else this time, I send it permanently, understood? Do what you have to do, John. And I will do what I have to do. You're fired, Dwyer! I hope it's worth it! Hello dear ! - Whose fur coat is it? - What fur? This fur coat there! Ridiculous. Who would have brought a fur here? Do not play this little game with me! Surprise, surprise! Hi. Oh Clay, you do not look good. Looks like you're the sick man and mom the nurse. You had to talk to him about it, did not you? We always say everything, you know it well. - All ? She told you all the details? - Clay! - I can not stand all these diseases. - Because it's very interesting, sis. - She started to ... - Oh, it smells like gas. - Every day .... - Did you hear mom? Go check! - Clay! Carla! Open the front door! And the window. Let's get some fresh air here. What are you doing ? Tell me, what is one of the newspapers today? I was fired and did not have the opportunity to see her! You have been fired. Another corpse found. Another corpse half devoured. I did not do anything. I told you what happened last night. - Where is she ? - Who ? - The whore! - I do not know ! - Oh, m'man! Good God ! - Clay, look at me! Do I look like last night? Did you check if it was the same woman? Is everything alright ? I do not feel anything at all. Everything is fine. I panicked a little fast. This headache plays tricks on me. You still talk about your illness, right? No. Clay just told me that he had forgotten something. He will have to shorten his visit. I'm going to have to go mom too. I'm sorry. Oh Carla, you just arrived. I know but a friend insisted I stay at his house if I come to town. I just wanted to surprise you, that's all. Oh, Carla. - I promise you to come tomorrow. - Goodbye Carla. Bye. If I'm wrong I'm sorry. But if I'm right it's you who will be. Still no idea? None since it was found. Prints ? For that you need fingers. Lord. I can have a beer ? So where is your friend? What can it fuck you? Did you see her tonight? Of course I saw her. I see Beverly every night. It's good. Son of a bitch. Sweetheart. Hi. What is that ? What? You did not leave. I was going to do it. I sat there for hours. So are you staying? It's you who should leave. But I can explain everything. If you knew how I would have liked to hear that earlier. - Alice, I ... - No! I stayed up all night, I can not think. - But I ... - No! How long ? Some time. I'll call you at your mother's place. Go to your mother's house, Clay! Clay. Alice kicked me out. Oh no, darling. What are you doing here, she needs you. Not anymore. I do not blame him. Oh dear. You are tired. You drank a little. Everything will be better tomorrow morning. No. I lost my job and lost Alice. Everything is my fault. I'm so sorry. No, you're right. I'm tired and drunk and everything will be better tomorrow morning, right? Go to sleep a little, darling. I need a drink. I do not understand. - Nestor ... - I'm not Nestor! Nestor has become what it was long ago. I imagine it will be the same for me. Shut up ! It was an instant change. I am at least happy not to have suffered. What are you doing ? Stay calm. She was so appetizing. Your own daughter! - She was a stranger. - She was your own daughter. How can you do this to me? Do you know what you're doing to me? You are killing me. I'm your mother, Clay. Not my mother! She would never have killed anyone. He is not there. Do you know where he is? Did he do anything? Alice, right? You know Alice, Clay was seen with another woman. Ah. And she did something? She is dead. Devoured in fact. - And you think that ... - No. Not at all. I am good enough to judge people. Clay Dwyer is not a killer. Stay down and take a look. Oh, lord. No ! - Do not touch her! - Leave me ! - Clay, damn it! - You do not know what you're doing! Emily. We do not move anymore! Shit ! Come this way ! No ! Mom, I will not let you hurt him. Alice! I beg you ... not my baby! M'man! Alice! Mom.
