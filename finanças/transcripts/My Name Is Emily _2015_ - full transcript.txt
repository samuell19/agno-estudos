Life happens quickly, like mountains in the background. You wake up one day and you don't know how you got there. And you wonder, "How long have I been asleep? Where have I been?" And nothing is recognisable. Everything is different from the last time you woke. Years have passed, and years are passing, and you suddenly know with absolute precision that you will die. And then comes the choice: To go back to sleep and hope that next time you wake you will have resolved yourself and you will be happy... ...or you choose to stay awake, to struggle with these unsatisfactory surroundings, to create something, anything, to love. I was born of contrary winds. They name hurricanes after me. If you hide from death, you hide from life. My name is Emily. You said it was the day that changed your life. Time stopped. Nothing remained... but that room, your wife. And me. And it came to you. You were a father... ...and you knew nothing. You said you stared into a great emptiness... ...and you took a step. And everything you read, all roads and rivers of thought, led you back to the one same truth - you had a daughter... ...and you knew nothing. She always said you were quiet, and that the year after I was born, you were quieter still. Never going out, never saying why. Just locking yourself in your study, night and day. Until one night, without warning... ...you spoke. Dead or alive. Some people just walk around like they've been alive for 100 years, and they're gonna be alive for 100 more. The same strapping on their armour. They can't hide the fear in their eyes. You spoke about things you had read for the last year. You spoke about being a father. You spoke about swimming in the ocean when you were a boy. You spoke in a way you had never spoken before. She said it was like watching a man giving birth to himself. You told everyone you had a new teacher teaching you the most important things in life. I was your teacher, and you were mine. They called me a weirdo. They're right. I was reading a book. They're still right. Come here. Read that. Suggesting something supernatural or uncanny. And here. From the old English weird meaning destiny, fate or the power to control destiny. Yes? So... So? They don't know that. But now you do. That's what it felt like when he spoke to me. And the world is new and small and large and expanding. And your heart is beating fast in your chest but only because you're alive. You started teaching at a local school. Life For Beginners. We blindly walk down roads built by others and the biggest tragedy of all... is that we believe the great lie. That we will live forever, that we will never die. But all roads lead to death. And having travelled down roads built by others, we arrive at death having never truly lived. You told people to live, swim, fight, love. But it wasn't until you started telling them to have sex that you really got noticed. You said people didn't have enough sex and that instead of going on expensive holidays, people should book into local hotels and just have sex. This is who we are!! Come on! Before anyone decided you were a threat to the establishment, it was too late, you had made it. The mainstream had embraced you. But really, you were only warming up. We've been taught to hide from death, from each other. We find so many ways to spend our time. Watching, preparing... planning how we would live our lives when we were ready. Are you ready? Everyone! Emily will be joining our class as of today. Now, would you like to say a few words about yourself, Emily? Or not! Find your seat, dear. The streets go on forever, but none lead to the sea. On and on forever, but none lead to the sea. Swim down into the deep. Down, down... down into the deep. I'm drowning in these streets. Ssssh! Steve and June aren't bad foster parents. I've had worse. I know I'm only here cause it's June's idea. She kills me every day with the kindness and the chit chat and the never deviating freshness. And every day, she fills the house with the pressure to be happy like Christmas. Clean towel, dear. Thanks. Until it bears down from the roof and I cannot breath. She's different. I fell in love with a dancer. She spun in the air like a dance of light. And watching her I felt more detached and yet more aware of everything than ever before. She danced until I felt hot and full of feeling. All the way home, she thought I was sick with tiredness or the cold. But it was love. Arden! Get your ass down here! Nothing, dear? I sure it'll come. Late for school. Happy birthday. Dad, are you... There have been others, but none like her. I wanted to disappear into the pools of her pale skin. If you've ever been electrocuted, you'll understand. Your whole body becomes your heart and then it stops. You feel alive and dead at the same time. ♪ Fill my head with the future ♪ ♪ Fill my eyes with the sky ♪ ♪ Whole of my life I've been left behind ♪ ♪ But I've never felt more alive ♪ It was like that. ♪ It should be easy but it's hard to leave ♪ What though the radiance which was once so bright Be now forever taken from my sight Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower We will grieve not, rather find strength in what remains behind. Copy books. Quietly! Explore this stanza under the following headings: Tone... ...diction... ...and form. Do you not understand the exercise? I do. Then what seems to be the problem? No problem. Well, perhaps you think because you're new the same rules don't apply. That you deserve special treatment like a little... playschool princess. No. Well, what then? I just don't want to do what you asked. Oh! Then perhaps you are unaware what you perceived to be a request was in fact an order. No, I was simply exercising my right not to follow orders. Isn't that what you're trying to teach us? Free will? - So we don't become Nazis? - Ssssh! Are you a smart alec, is that it? I don't want to cut up this poem. Why not? Because when cut something up you kill it. Well, perhaps you'd like to elucidate the rest of us on how best to approach this verse. Wordsworth is talking about sex. Sssh! Sex that he had in the grass with a girl, most likely his first, and hers. He's talking about no such thing. Sex that he had with a French girl, Annette Vallon, the daughter of a barber-surgeon by whom he had an illegitimate daughter Anne Caroline. He was wildly in love but he was so ashamed at what he had done that he abandoned both her and the child. He felt so guilty that he never wrote openly about love or sex, he just buried it in references to nature. What though the radiance which was once so bright Be now forever taken from my sight Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower We will grieve not, rather find strength in what remains behind. He loved her but because of the mores of the day, he abandoned both her and the child and he never saw his daughter again. What's wrong with you? Leave her alone. Don't mind them. I can take care of myself, thanks. When she died, she took away the light. They told me she had gone to other places, better places. But I knew she hadn't. She always knew where I was, no matter where I was in the house. Now I couldn't feel her anywhere. They told me she'd gone somewhere, but if she had I would have gone there too. She was nowhere. And now no-one knew where I was. When you frown underwater, it makes a noise. You cannot cry. Sometimes I can hear it, like a hurricane. Like an underwater wind. The music. They always listened to it loud when I wasn't in the car. Said it made them feel young. My father kept everything, all lecture notes and half-scribbled thoughts, in the boot of our car. When they hit, it spread across the road in a wave of white noise. Everything you worried about, everything you ever feared... gone... ...in an instant. In the face of something much worse than you could have ever imagined. I was at home... waiting for them. It was my birthday. What happened? Are you alright? Can't swim! Can't swim. What the hell are you playing at? Jumping in at the deep end if you can't swim? What's wrong with you? It's my birthday. For God's sake! Go on, you're done for the day. Freak. < Okay, guys, let's get a move on. Hi. I'm from your school. I told you I can take care of myself. Yeah, but you didn't look very happy so I followed you home. I got you this because I wanted to help you feel better. You'd better come in. Yeah. It is your birthday, though, isn't it? I thought it might have been a joke. You don't have a religious belief against gifts? Because I don't know you very well, I didn't know what to buy you so I picked something I like. Have you read it? Yes. It's an old copy. Yes. Gran says they're the best cause they've got the memory of hands on them. It was hers. She gave it to me. What's your name? Arden. Happy birthday!! God, you don't want it! So, I'll... I'll see you around... Fuck! ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ What we called love ♪ I'll catch you guys tomorrow. ♪ What we called love ♪ I've only been here for a while myself. We moved over last year. I'm half-Irish. My granny is Irish. So is my father, obviously, as her son. I work in a video shop. Oh! So... you like swimming. This is... Nice house. Yeah. Would you like to come in? See you tomorrow. Bye. < Hi, Emily! Still nothing, dear. Why do we smile in photographs? Do we just forget? Not knowing how we felt, just that we were told to smile. Sleep. Sleep, angel face. I'm not tired. I know. Just try closing your eyes and see. Okay. Will you stay with me? Yeah. Until I sleep? Until you fall asleep. I'll be here when you wake up. What's this? Not an "", it's a F! It says "easily distracted". Yeah, but the teacher is a complete cow- Don't talk back to your mother. You'd want to spend less time with your so-called job and with your mad grandmother. See ya later. Get your bag, we're going. Is Arden in? Yes. Hold on. Hi. Hi, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, sure. The other day you said you wanted to help me. Yeah, of course. What is it? I'm leaving. Leaving? Now. My father is in a psychiatric institution and my mother died on my birthday. That's why I was weird with you the other day at my house. I'm being honest because you're the only person I know in the city and I trust you and I don't know why. My father writes me a letter once a month and on my birthday. No letters came and I'm worried. So, I'm going north to break him out of the nuthouse they've put him in. But I can't do it alone. I need your help. You should know that if you do want to help then we have to go now cause if I'm not there for breakfast, my foster parents call social services, they've no choice. I need to get a head start. That's the deal. We go now. Will you help me? Forget it. Where are you going? I'm going. Aren't you forgetting something? I'm leaving. Pick up your fucking schoolbag and get in the car. What are you going to do? Hit me?

Your father has been doing it his whole life. You can't go anywhere in that school uniform, you're drenched. Your grandfather proposed to me in this suit on top of the Empire State Building. That was the last time he wore it. He said it had done its duty after that. I can't take this, Gran. < Why? Your grandfather is in the ground. Come on. Help me. Voilà! Get in. It's quite comfy. It will never start. Try it. I keep it oiled with a full tank of petrol. Your grandfather showed me how, in case I ever needed to escape! - Everything is in the boot. - Thanks, Gran. Thanks, Gran. Good luck. Good luck. Nice suit by the way. Thanks. Can we go any faster? No. You missed the turn! No I didn't. We're going on the motorway. We're going that way. No way. We'll never get there. We will, it's just we'll get there in one piece. It's dead. What about yours? I don't have one. I'll be blue. You be white. What?! Cars! - One. - No thanks. No problem. Just head north. Sorry about your mum. Thanks. So, what is the deal with your dad? He's a writer. Cool. Yeah, cool. Not really. No. So, where are you from? We moved around a lot. I went from school to school until he took me out altogether. Said it was a waste of time. We were always travelling - book tours, lectures. We never talked about her. For him, it was all about living in the moment, renouncing the past. But I'd hear him at night. He became obsessive about his work. Not sleeping, barely eating. Day and night. He became obsessed with the idea that on a molecular level there was no difference between us and a blade of grass. It haunted him. He started telling me there were no limits. That the important thing was to live as you felt like living, and he did. Fine morning! And every day he would go further and further. Look at this. There were reports of unusual behaviour... ...and the locals started sending messages. So we sent our own message back. But it got worse. It doesn't matter if I'm a blade of grass. She's a blade of grass. I'm a blade of grass, it's the same molecules. It's the same... molecules. She's got the same molecules. I've got the same molecules. We've got the same molecules as a blade of grass. It's the same. It's just the same. She's got the same... She's all together, she's all together, I'm all apart. She's apart, she's floating... just apart. And I'm all twisted in together. The molecules are all together. We're just the same! We're just the same! Dad. It was the incident in Dublin that eventually did it. He said that he was happy. That he'd realised the secret of everything. That life and death were connected and that he finally let my mother go, set her free. But they didn't see it like that. Then they got a distant relative to sign the papers. No, no, no! Dad! Dad! Dad, don't go! Please don't go! Let me say goodbye to my daughter. Please don't go! Nothing can separate us. You understand? Not these people, nobody or nothing. You know why? Cause we've got the sea inside us, haven't we? Look... Don't worry. Don't worry, my beautiful daughter. Just remember who you are, okay? Remember who you are. You're my little weirdo, aren't you? You're my little weirdo. No, no, no, no! Please no! No! No, he's my dad! No, come back! I need you! Please! I visited him at first, but he just became more and more distant. He stopped leaving his room and he stopped calling me by my name. Emily was my mother's name. In the end, they just said the visits were too upsetting for him, that I reminded him too much of her, that he needed time. Great! Great! I mean, what about you? I was passed around the family at first, ended up at my uncle's. They had this son. He was a few years older than me. My cousin. He'd read some of Dad's books and he thought, "Maybe we could put them into practice." Didn't work out too well. Ran out of family after that. But wherever I was, Dad never stopped writing to me. The letters became fragments but we were talking. And then they just stopped altogether. I have this friend whose brother died and now his family, they Photoshop his face into all their family pictures. And I don't know why I said that. That's the weirdest thing I've ever heard.

Wait! She said try the boot! So, what is the plan? I go in to visit him, you cause a distraction, I get him out. That's it! Yeah. What if they don't let you see him? They have to. I'm his daughter. < What if he's not... well? He's fine. When my father was a student, he said he loved books. All he ever did. Eat, drink and sleep books. One day he got a job in one of the big city bookshops. < He just said he was really happy. He used to smell books. That's how much he loved them! His favourite thing was the smell of a new book. One day they put him in charge of the deliveries. He went down to do a stock take of all the new books coming in on these pallets - thousands of them. Each one with hundreds of copies of the same books sitting in these massive blocks of colour and he just... he just saw them all as this big, giant jigsaw puzzle. And a few days later... he said he couldn't look at a new book in the same way... ...without seeing a big printing blade slicing through them. They'd lost that special feeling. They smelled industrial. He doesn't read anything now. That's really sad. Yeah, yeah, I know. Sorry, I don't know where I was going with that. Breakfast. Fact is a point of view. No, it isn't. Yes it is. A fact is a fact. Where do you think they come from? They just are. They are the way things are. We're walking down this aisle - fact! No, it's just your point of view. We may not be in the supermarket. I may not even exist. One plus one equals two? Listen, everything that you call a fact is just a bunch of people getting together, agreeing on something and then calling it a fact. That's how facts change. People change their minds. The world is flat, the world is round. You can't really blame people for wanting to believe in facts. Without another point of view to agree with us, say an alien, we'll never know if our opinion on anything is right or wrong. Even if we had an alien, that's just two points of view. Just cause facts are opinions doesn't mean they're wrong. They're usually right. It's just when we forget that they're just all well-thought out opinions, that's when people start doing stupid things like making atomic bombs. They think, "Facts are facts. We have to do it to show that we could." Facts are just the excuse for everything. The sun will rise tomorrow. Is that a fact? No! That's a point of view of a human being - me at the moment. And it's a good point of view, I think, cause I think the sun will rise tomorrow. But will the sun rise tomorrow without my- I don't know. I don't know, Emily! You're fucking with my head the whole way around with this stuff. What do you want me to say, I don't know, cause... I don't know. Are you happy now? What? You make me... you make me feel stupid. Sorry. That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. Just the flowers please. Don't look back, just walk. Just walk normal. I am walking normal. Run! Hey! Come here! Stop! Go! Bye! What the fuck was that?! What?! You said we needed breakfast. Yeah, and we pay for it like normal people! I have money! Got money, right there! We need that for petrol. Anyway, what is normal? Don't start that again! Listen! If we're doing this, you can't do that! Okay! I need to know the plan, what's happening. Okay. Not okay, Emily! That was not okay. I know you've got problems... What would you know with your perfect life and perfect parents?! You don't know anything about my family! You don't ask so you don't know. You're not the only one with problems and just cause you're so wrapped up in your own... I'm not just a puppet. I know. You don't know everything. I know. Sorry. Fine. Thanks for coming with me. You're welcome. Where are we? Listen, I don't know if you're thinking something is going to happen but it won't. You offered to help. I don't owe you anything. You don't owe me anything. I'll be blue. I'll be... - One! - Really? Oh shit! Are you lost? No. No. License? Yeah! Holy shit! Excuse me? I've left it... It's at home. It's at home. Okay. Hold on a sec. Drive! - Drive! - What?! They'll take us in for sure. Calm down. He's just gonna... He'll just let us go? Yes. We haven't done anything wrong. We've run away and we've robbed a shop. Arden, please, I need to see my father.

Old building, staff about the grounds. Okay, James Bond, what's the plan? Don't mind him. I'm afraid I got a bit turned around. I'm looking for my dad's room. I thought they said it was this way. What's his name? Robert Egan. And you are? Emily... Emily Egan. 114. Top of the stairs, down on the left. Thank you. Hey! Get down! Dad? Emily? Where is he? He's gone. What do you mean "he's gone?" Only a few days ago. Dr Golding, I'm the director of this establishment. Where's my father? Why don't we have tea in my office. Your friend will be in when he has finished playing with the guards. I often think the world is turned inside out, that they send some of the sanest people here to me. Have you read Plato? Oh well, he wrote this great piece called the Allegory of the Cave. All these people are sitting in rows in a cave Staring at the shadows flickering on the wall. They are bound to the seats by chains. For them, the shadows are the only reality. Here, you see the people chained staring at shadows. Just like a multiplex. But one man struggles with the chains, frees himself and finds a path up to the light. He stands in the sun and is enlightened. Now, that could be the end of the man's story but this man walks back into the cave, back into the shadow, back to free people. This man who saw the light and instead of basking in it returned to help others is - according to Plato - the philosopher. This man is your father. The problem with all this shepherding of people out of the darkness is that the philosopher himself, blinded by the glare of the sun or by grief can lose his grip on what is real and what is illusion. My father is not crazy. This place is a cave for many people, Emily. A hiding place from the world. There's no shame in it. But Dad wasn't hiding! You locked him up. Emily... your father was a voluntary patient here. You're lying. Why would I lie? But I was there when... they took him. Yes, Robert was initially committed but after a month of observation, he elected to become an inpatient. Emily, you've got to understand... Stop saying my name! You don't know me! We don't hold sane people against their will. Sometimes, people just break. Even our parents. Hey! Hey, hey! What's wrong? Where is he? Where is he? Let's just go. So he's gone. But to where?

I have to go change. Sit down. Yeah. Found some coffee. Heated it up on the stove. It's mum's. Yeah. Could I borrow a shirt or something? Yeah, sure. Upstairs on the right-hand side there's a cupboard. Help yourself. June is a good woman. She sends me letters letting me know how you're getting on. She thinks the world of you, Emily. I came looking for you to say I'm sorry, Emily. For everything. And that I'm here for you, if you'll have me. I only know one thing. I'm an old fool. And I love you. That's two things. I love you too, Dad. Morning. Good morning. Sleep well? Coffee? Yes, please. Thanks. I haven't been much of a dad, have I? You're not dead yet. That's exactly what I was thinking this morning when I woke up! So, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna stay with June. You should stay here. Do some writing. Good idea. Might write a book. My Time In A Nuthouse! I'd read that. You can always come and visit, you know. Just come any time you want. I will. June will be getting worried about me. Yeah. What about loverboy? He brings me coffee. If you've ever been electrocuted, you'll understand. There is a sadness in this country. In the cities and the streets, in the fields and the trees. A sadness we cannot hide. It's the fact of losing the ones we love, the fact of being alone. < Emily! But facts are only points of view and points of view can change. Come on! Life happens quickly like mountains in the background. And you wake up one day and you don't know how you got there and you wonder, "Where have I been? How did I get here?" And nothing is recognisable. Everything is different from the last time you woke. And you smile in a photograph just because you're happy. And that voice that is speaking is suddenly your own. ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ What we called love ♪ ♪ I'll wait up ♪ To see if you're alright ♪ ♪ And I have waited in the darkness ♪ ♪ For my whole life ♪ ♪ You see the funny thing about it ♪ ♪ Is I have never wasted time ♪ ♪ I have never thought about it ♪ ♪ That I have lied ♪ ♪ And I'm trying to do my best but you might never know it ♪ ♪ And I'm standing like a stag beside a tree ♪ ♪ And this pounding in my head I simply can't control it ♪ ♪ And I hope your love it comes as guarantee ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ And I reach out ♪ ♪ And pluck it from the sky ♪ ♪ And I have waited for that bird to pass ♪ ♪ For my whole life ♪ ♪ You see the funny thing about it ♪ ♪ Is I have only wasted mine ♪ ♪ I have always thought about you ♪ ♪ And I have died ♪ ♪ And I'm trying to do my best but you might never notice ♪ ♪ And I'm standing like a stag beside a tree ♪ ♪ And this pounding in my head I simply can't control it ♪ ♪ And I hope your love it comes as guarantee ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪ ♪ It's you alone ♪
