TIME IS RELATIVE. A EINSTEIN All stories are about someone. And this one's about me. My name is Mariana and I've been dreaming of being an astronaut for as long as I can remember. And I'd like to take you on the greatest adventure ever. There's something special about space. It's infinite. Uncharted. And then it's dangerous! JOURNEY TO SPACE It all started when we were going to move in with dad's new girlfriend. And there were two good things about it. One: There was a space base in the town. I got to go to camp there. And two: My new room. Well at least, it was an attic. It had been empty for over 40 years, but was full of the coolest old forgotten space stuff imaginable. - Not on your life! I refuse! - Now you just sharpen up, Marcus! - Mariana, unfortunately, the research camp's been cancelled. I've spoken to Marcus's camp and you can go there instead. - To—sports camp? - Did you think of checking with me? No. You didn't. And she can't come! - I won't hear another word about this. Mariana's your sister and she can't be alone when we're in Cyprus. - Sports is fun too, isn't it? - You marrying her dad doesn't make her my sister! Plus everyone thinks she's weird. - Marcus! - No one likes her, - Marcus! - Do you understand?! - In my old school we were a whole bunch of us who loved space. But here there's nobody. You were kind of teased if you liked space. Teased! Because you dreamed of becoming an astronaut. It just spun around in my head. The camp was cancelled. And I wondered if I would ever reach my dream. Hey. I said, hey. - Cut it out. - Oi! - Just stop it! - Just stop it! What d'you think you're doing? You know what this cost? This cost more than your loser of a father makes in a year. Fuckin' nerd! Okay, everyone who wants to play basketball take a ball each, you hear? Over there. And anyone who wants to go orienteering can go to Harriet. - What're the nerds going to do then? - Enough of that, you. - Good, Marcus. - No, Hold on a sec. Like this. Come here, Marcus. Didn't you notice you have other people in the team? - But I nailed it— - There's no "I" in "team", all right? If the opposition get a day to play together they'll take you apart. We won't stand a chance. - Oh hell! No! - What? You two, get the bike back at once. Understand? -What d'you mean? What have I done?! - That's your sister, isn't it? - No, it isn't. - Don't make a fuss about it, Marcus. See it as an opportunity to practise cooperation. Main fuel cell fully charged. Reserve fuel cell, 97.8%. Production of anti-protons: Stable. Electromagnetic Anti-Proton Trap: Stable. Particle Accelerator: Stable. Impulse potential— - Do you know how lucky you are? - How's that then? - You don't have to have you as a pretend sister. You think I asked to have you as a brother? No, not exactly. - Space nerd. - Jock. - Look! The bike! - Come on! Warning! Warning! Alien object behind Andromeda. Switch telescope to interferometric hyper telescopy. Warning! Giant asteroid headed straight for Earth. Expected to hit in four hours. Come on! Look! It looks just like a particle accelerator, but smaller. You know, CERN? - No—? There's a place in Switzerland called CERN. They have a tunnel there where they collide atoms. Every time they collide it's like the Big Bang. More energy than you can ever imagine. But—why would anyone want to build something like that? This is Albert Mann here. I have something extremely important to tell you. - Hi, Albert. How's it going? Finished your little rocket yet? - Please, listen. There's an asteroid headed for Earth as we speak. It's bigger than all of England! - You don't say? Exciting. So what will happen? - What will happen is the earth gets wiped out before I can save Lisa. We have to smash this asteroid before it's too late! - Albert, enough of this nonsense about asteroids and stuff. You've called us enough. - Idiot! Lemming! It's time! This is creepy. Mariana, what are you doing? ROC, change of plan. Are the engines warmed up? - Answer: No. Planned departure in seven days. - Then we're stone dead. How many minutes to fastest possible start-up? - Neither the engines nor the escape capsule have been tested. I'm the captain, you're the computer. Do as I say before I shut you down. If you shut me down manually, it takes two hours for me to start again. Mariana! Mariana, let's go! - This is absolutely insane. It shouldn't work. - What're you talking about? - The particle accelerator. If it works, you can propel a rocket at the speed of light. - That's enough. We have to get out of here. Come on! - ROC, report on the asteroid. - Asteroid speed: 19,000 km per second. The asteroid will hit Earth in 3 hours and 54 minutes. - Lemming! Lemming, change of plan! We have to shoot down an asteroid. HOW TO LOVE YOURSELF And save Earth before we save Lisa. - I'm sitting on the toilet. - Ignition sequence commenced. Launch in 30 seconds. Launch in 20 seconds. Launch in 15 seconds. Conventional engines: Full power. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one— - Are we dreaming? Launch. What was that?! - I don't know! What's going on? - You have to go up and check. - No, you can do that. - Not on your life. This is all your fault. Lemming, checklist. Ordinary engines, function? - Check. - Gammatron, light speed engine and laser cannon? - Check. Albert. - Escape capsule? - Now you have to listen to me— - Fuel cells? - Check, check and check. But—you might be able to enlist the help of your stowaways instead. Because I'm kind of busy— - What?! Children? For—What have you—? What's—? By every slobbering woodlouse and— - You're Albert Mann. - What? Who's that? - Yes, who is that? To find out, we have to go a long way back in time. Man has just landed on the moon and the whole world is space crazy. Including Albert Mann, who just filled a toy rocket with potassium nitrate and sugar. By the way, a very stupid idea. - You should have stabilizers on that. You need at least three tail fins. And the centre of gravity must be in front of the aerodynamic pressure point. Understand? Can't you talk, or what? - Come on now, Lisa. - Bye! Before that day, Albert Mann had not so much as thought of becoming a rocket designer. But now—he was in love. Never before had he met someone who knew so much about rockets. And he made a vow that if only he could see the girl again, then he would devote the rest of his life to becoming the best rocket builder ever. And he didn't have to wait very long. Listen please. This is Lisa Connor. She's starting with us. Lisa was only nine years old, same as Albert. But she already knew what she was going to be when she grew up. The first woman on the moon. - Do you know what it's going to be called? - No? Moon-a-Lisa. Albert realized that he had met the great love of his life. So he plucked up the courage to ask if they could go steady. And from that day they were inseparable. - Come on! Lisa's attic became a space base where they built rocket after rocket. And soon they were so skilled, they began to dream about building something— no one had ever built before. - You know—one day in the future, someone will figure out how to fly at the speed of light. And then you'll be able to travel in time. - I'm going to build a rocket that can do that. - I know. Time went by. School, high school, university, work. Still together and still as much in love. At last they arrived at their destination. They were employed at Europe's largest space base. Albert designed rockets and Lisa became an astronaut. And they celebrated that with a wedding. But they didn't have time for a honeymoon,. because Lisa—was going into space. - Here—something I made for you. It's a laser pointer. It reaches all the way to the moon. So you can shine it on me when I'm up there. It takes 1.3 seconds for the light to reach the moon. Then another 1.3 seconds for the light to bounce back to you. Distance and time, same thing. - Yes, they are. But Albert was a troubled soul. - Do you have to go? If anyone knew how dangerous rockets were, it was him. He didn't want Lisa to go. Lisa got angry and, for the first time ever— they parted as enemies. - Wait! Lisa, wait— Lisa! Hundreds of technicians prepared to launch the rocket. So for Albert there wasn't much to do except settle down in front of the TV, and watch as Lisa and her fellow astronauts set off on their historic journey to the moon. But something was wrong. Very wrong. And only Albert saw it. The leaking fuel line. Hello! Hello? Answer it! Hello! Lisa was gone And all that was left were notebooks, shoes, clothes— and the laser pointer. You know, one day in the future, someone will figure out how to fly at the speed of light. And then you'll be able to travel in time. - I'm going to build a rocket that can do that. - I know. From that day on, Albert had only one goal. He would finish the rocket, fly back in time and stop the accident— before it happened. Finally, it started to take shape. He named the rocket Moon-a-Lisa. But when the rocket was almost ready, the asteroid came. And when he took off to stop the asteroid, that's when we ended up on board. Yes. And you know the rest. - Who are you? What are you doing here? How did you get in here? - We were looking for a bike. - A bike? This is a flying madhouse! I— ROC, prepare escape pod, return of two half-finished humans. - Albert. - What is it? - You do know the escape pod has not been tested. - Then it's just about to be. - There is a high risk that the escape capsule will not work. Ten seconds to gammatron initiation. - Hell! Wait, wait, wait. Preparing to leave Earth orbit. Should you be sending two children off in an escape pod that might not work? Albert? Albert? - Hush! I'm trying to think! - You have five seconds. - Seriously? I am sending the children home. - I am sending the children home. I am sending the children home. - NO! Abort! Continue on pre-programmed route. - As you wish. The children stay on board. - 36% light speed. - Light speed? The speed of light. It's the fastest you can ever go. - 36% light speed. Seat belts are recommended. - Seat belts— Lemming, a cup of coffee! - Listen, Albert. May I ask you something? Do I look like a servant lemming? Do I look like someone who goes around doing things on command? No. Certainly not. You can play with your new friends for a while. I'm busy. - So come up here and sit. Come, come, come! It's—it's absolutely amazing. Where are we? - In the exosphere. The borderline— - between Earth and space. - I'm so tired of this. He promised I'd become great. Someone who matters. But no one says, "Oh Lemming! You're great, you are!" "We're going to build a little statue of you because you're so great!" Who says that? No one! What you give is what you get, sort of. - Lemming's stomach can't take those raspberry boats. - I heard that! It certainly can! - Why can he talk? - You'll have to ask him about that. - Why can you talk? - What? - Yes, we're wondering why you can talk. - Why can I talk? Well, I'll tell you children. It's because Albert made it to CERN. - CERN? - I know what that is. Big bang, sort of thing. - Yes. He went to CERN to learn all about how to make antiprotons and particle accelerators. But—no one wanted to tell him how to do it. And that's where he found me. He thought I seemed smart. Then he got the idea that I could help him, which probably wasn't so stupid. You see, as a lab lemming, I've been involved in every single test. There's probably no one in the world who knows more about how to make light speed fuel than I do. And Albert understood that. And so that I could explain it to him, he fitted me with synthetic vocal cords. He promised to make me world famous— and I promised to help him save Lisa. And so here we are: The genius and the zero. - You showoff. I should have invented an off switch for you too. - If anyone talks too much, it's you! - No it's not! - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No. - Yes. No. - Yes. Kids, get over here and buckle up now because we're getting close. - Close? - Yes, actually you can't— Yes, yes—you can, you can come along. - Come along where? - To Mars. To Mars?! - What about the camp? - Forget the camp. We're going to Mars. Albert's plan was as simple as it was brilliant. Moon-a-Lisa was propelled by enormous energy. If you focused it you got a laser cannon that could smash the asteroid into gravel. But you had to aim very carefully. And on Mars there was Spirit. It had a radar accurate enough to achieve that. Albert would retrieve it and then he would shoot down the asteroid. ROC, prepare for landing. Initiating Mars orbit. May I be permitted to remind you that all systems are untested. Warning! Automatic landing out of order. Warning! Warning! Warning! Control system overheating. Careful now. And stay close while I find the—oh never mind. Careful! We'll gather under the ramp as soon as I'm done. Exactly what is it about "Take me back to my cabin and leave me alone" that you don't understand? You hairy two-legged ape. Put me down, or I'll beat you up so your teeth go marching through your ears. No! No no no—! My own private Liseberg! Now don't misunderstand this and start thinking I like you— but please, do it again? - Are you sure? - Yes! Don't you dare? Or maybe you're too weak? Batlemming! First superhero! - Watch out, Marcus! - Marcus! - How did that go? - It went well, I think. Is that the robot you're looking for? - A racing car. - Yes yes. It could well be. - Come and check. - No no, I'm fine here. - Come on! - It's very high up here. Can you look around to see if there's any other way to get down there? Because if you fall here you could die. Wait! Stop, you hear! Leave that alone! Lemming! - Albert! - Don't be such a big bore! - Albert! Are you all right? - Lemming! Stop, don't touch that! - No! I'm driving now! Come and catch me if you can! - This is not a toy. - What? What's up? It was as if the asteroid knew what we were doing. Because around all asteroids there is space gravel and pebbles. - It wasn't me! And now it was passing right above us. - Quickly! Come on, run! - What about me? -What do we do now? - I don't know. We have to survive these bloody space rocks. And then we have to shoot down the asteroid. - But we can't see what we're aiming at! - Lemming, you get to aim! - Then maybe it would be good if you waited for me! - Marcus! - Get him to the front of the rocket! Go up and strap in! Gammatron switched to front cannon. Asteroid almost within range. - I'm in position! Fingers crossed now. This could go either way. - Come on now, Albert. - You can handle this. - Front cannon activated. - One shot, then we can go home. - If we have enough power and if I hit it. Distance to asteroid: 22 kilometers. - I have the asteroid in sight. - Can't we get any closer? - No. There's a real risk we'll be smashed by all that debris flying around. - But— - Can you be quiet now? - Asteroid right in the firing line. Seven, six, five, four, three, Gammatron fired. - No, no, no. What have I done now? - Yes, what have you done now? - Warning! Warning! - Space debris. What just happened? Did we get it? Calculating any change in the asteroid's orbit. - What happens now? - Albert, we have to do something! - Yeah, but what? - Just hope it changes direction a bit and misses the earth by a few centimetres or something. Three hours until the end of the world. - Yeah. - Does that mean—? - In three hours, there will be no Earth for us to land this thing on. We get to spin around up here until our oxygen runs out. - But all our friends at camp? And Mum? - And Dad? But wait—you built Moon-a-Lisa to travel back in time—for Lisa! But it doesn't work any longer. It's too late. - Yes, but what about this: if we can go back in time, we can go back to yesterday. Then we'll get another chance to shoot down the asteroid. - A pro is an amateur who never gave up. Passing Phobos. Demos. Jupiter. Saturn. - Uranus and Neptune. - This is going well. Now we just have to follow a spiral arm towards the centre of the Milky Way. There should be a hole here. - A hole? - Yes, a black hole we have to get through. There. There it is. No, put that back. - But how do we get through? - The gammatron. We just need enough proton energy left after the shot so we can cope with the enormous gravity in the hole. - And what happens then? - All we have to do is get through the hole, travel back to yesterday, fly down to Earth, swap the fuel cell for the reserve, fly up again, and get another chance to shoot down the asteroid. - Wait, have you thought this through? - "Have you thought this through—" Sometimes you shouldn't think, you should just do. It's about being brave and bold. Music, maestro. Are you okay? - Again please. - Depends what you mean by okay. - No more black holes, yeah? - Straight line now. We'll be there soon. - One more time! One more time! - Is that Earth? - It looks weird. - Yes, maybe it looks odd from this angle. - Something's not right. - What? What d'you mean? - The parts of the world look really weird. - Yeah. - Where are we? - Rather: When are we? What's happening? - Fuel level: Critical. - Now you tell us? Idiot! - Whoever says it, is it. - Parachutes. Now. - A please would be appreciated. - Please! Parachutes. Here you go. Where are we? - Okay—well, the good news: Trees, grass. Look. Palm trees and oxygen. We're definitely back on Earth. Home Sweet Home. - And the bad news? - What did you say? - You said the good news is that there are trees and oxygen. That means there's bad news too. - Yes, but now we won't get stuck on— - What was that? Dinosaurs? Aren't they extinct? - No, you can't actually say that. Our birds are related to them and many other animals too. - We're not in our own time, are we? - You could say we've flown millions of years off course. - Idiot! - Marcus! - What? I can say exactly what I want! We're lost in space and lost in time. And all this is your fault. - My fault?! - Here we go again. - It was a mistake, okay? - And there was me thinking it was science! - I hate you! - Not as much as I hate you! And you know something else? I wish our parents had never met! - Same here! Seriously! - Well that's good. At least there's one thing you agree on. - Listen. Friends. We're here now, and it doesn't matter whose fault it is. Shit happens. Shit happens even if it smells. - He's right. It doesn't matter whose fault it was. - No? Maybe I think it does! - We're screwed, aren't we? - Well, as Albert usually says: relatively. Hello. How are you? Are you sick? There there. Come on now. Mariana! Mariana! Mariana! Help! Marcus! Marcus! - Check out Spielberg! He rocks! - Spielberg? Is that what you call him? - Don't you understand? This is Jurassic Park. - Don't give him a name. You'll just become attached to him. - So what? He's really cute. Aren't you such a cute little dino, Spielberg? He likes me. - Marcus, I think it's time to go now. - Shit! - Come on. This way. Over there! Run! Bye, Spielberg! - No names, I said. - Nice moves. - You call that nice moves? I'll show you nice moves. - Do you know how old that is? - Old? You might be old. I'm 65 million years ahead of my time. 65! Million years! Check it out. Those were nice moves. Mic drop. First with that too. 65 million years actually. - You're crazy. - Yeah. Friends again? - Of course. - Did you do anything fun? - Just looked around a bit. It is definitely the Jurassic period. Or Cretaceous. - I'm afraid I can give you a more accurate time than that. - Afraid? - Yes, afraid. - It can't be true. - What—? Did the asteroid follow us here? - No, I think that's another one. The asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs and ended the entire Cretaceous period. The largest asteroid to ever hit our Earth. We are exactly 66,036,010 years before Christ. Which is the information I need to get the rocket going so we can get out of here. - Then let's go! - It's just that ROC is dead. - What d'you mean, dead? - And it's my fault. I was trying to replace the fuel cell and I short-circuited it So now it'll take two hours to get the gammatron going again. And the asteroid strikes in one hour 45 minutes. - Sometimes things go wrong even though you do the best you can. Just when I was getting a strange feeling of—liking you. So much you wanted to do and it ends like this. Life. It was a real slap in the face. We'd made it through space, Mars, black holes and dinosaurs. But now we were going to die. 65 million years from home. Do you believe in an afterlife? - What? What do you mean? - Yeah, that you might get to see Lisa again. Even if you couldn't save her. - Who knows? But the question is whether we die here and now in this time— and then the question is whether we share Heaven with a lot of dead dinosaurs. - But then you just have to sit up there and wait for 65 million years. Then maybe you'll get to see Lisa again. - Yes that's true. Do you think that I—I mean, that I could become an astronaut? If everything was different, I mean. - Just look at yourself. - What d'you mean? - You're already an astronaut. - Am I? - How many people do you think have been to Mars? How many people have travelled through black holes and crash-landed a rocket with just parachutes? - But I'm no pro. - A pro is just an amateur who never gave up. - What did you say? - A pro is just an— - No, we crash-landed the rocket with— - Parachutes? - Right. Come on. Marcus! Lemming! Do we have more of these? - Yes, we have three spare chutes. - Bring them here. We'll make balloons. Get cutting! How high up do we have to be to be safe from the asteroid strike? - A couple of kilometers, I think. This asteroid is only a fraction of the one we saw on Earth. Right! All aboard! Sit down now, hurry up. ROC! Doors! Now! - ROC is dead! Yes, of course. Go on up and sit down! Buckle up, everyone! And cast off the moorings! Finally we lifted off the ground. But it was far too slow. But luckily we had Lemming. - Albert! Open the front hatch! - What for? And his bad stomach. - Open it, I said. - Yes, yes, I'm opening it. ROC! - We are falling! ROC! You're alive! Would you like me to proceed in English or Swedish? - Swedish, you idiot. Start the engine. - Ignition command. Ignition in 20 seconds. - We don't have 20 seconds! - ROC, I bet you can't start now, right away! Can't I? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard this Moon-a-Lisa with destination Earth, present time. I hope you are all sitting comfortably and strapped in. Because we're about to go like shit off a shovel. It was pure luck we managed to get out of there. Yes, and some skill too. But now we have to go straight back to our time and stop the asteroid. Because if we don't succeed, well then that's it—all over. Then you two have no future. Neither has anyone else, for that matter. - But what about Lisa? - Sometimes you have to put others before yourself. Are we travelling in time now? - Yes, we're travelling through time as if on a highway, you might say. Although we're passing years instead of villages and towns. - So you could sort of stop and jump off? Like a train? - Yes. That was the point. - To stop. Stop the accident. Save Lisa. But now, now it won't turn out like that. - But you'll repair the rocket and try again, won't you? Sometime in the future? - Yes, well, maybe. - Then I want to go with you. May I? - With a little astronaut school, you could actually become really good. - Do you really think so? - No. I know so. What's going on? - Why's it howling? - It's the alarm. The escape pod's gone. It must have come loose. - What does that mean? - Nothing really. As long as Moon-a-Lisa holds together. There. We're almost there. Lemming, everyone in position. - Have you seen my mobile phone? - Lemming, come on. - It was just here. - What? - Look! - Can I see? It's from Lemming. - Really? What does it say? Dear Albert! You know I've always wanted to be someone people will remember. Not just a lemming among all the others, so to speak. And besides, we lemmings don't get that bloody old. I might have three months left, maybe a year. And I've had a great life. - Much better than anyone else— any other lemming—I know. You know, I think there comes a time in every lemming's life, when it's time to do what's right rather than what you want. So even if it means I'll never be world famous— I'll try to stop the launch of the rocket. So that Lisa doesn't die. And if I can do that, then comes the big challenge. Because then I have to persuade her and the young you to build the rocket even though she isn't dead. So that we may actually have been on this trip. Yes, you can hear for yourself how complicated it sounds. So I took Marcus's mobile phone. Yes, sorry, but I had to. So that I can convince the young you and young Lisa to build the rocket you are now sitting in. And that you jump into it yourself that day that you actually did. So you and the kids can fly away and maybe stop the asteroid. You know, Albert. I like you. I'll miss you. And the kids too. Good luck with the asteroid. Because— yeah, if you miss, well, then it's all over. Listen! Look over there! - This is absolutely insane.That's us. Yes, but back then. We've arrived just before we left. That's why this sort of thing can happen. - That feels like an eternity ago. - This time we'll try to do it right. Mariana, will you take over here? - What?! - I can't shoot and steer at the same time. You saw how it went last time. - But— - No buts now! You're an astronaut. Didn't we say that? - Oh! Sorry. - No problem. ROC, status? - Distance to the asteroid: 1,200 kilometers. - Marcus? The telescope. This time we won't miss. - Telescope: Activated. Distance: 300 kilometers. Gammatron switched to front cannon. - Hold on tight now, Mariana. - Aye, aye, captain. The asteroid will hit Earth in seven minutes. - Within firing range. - Careful now. A little closer. Gently. Asteroid is six minutes from Earth orbit. - Now! - Missed! - Asteroid still undamaged. Direction straight towards Earth. - What do we do now? - The only way is to get closer. But then we risk being crushed by the impact itself. - Do we have a choice? - No, not if we've got nothing to aim at. Use this. As a sight. - What? In here? No, you have to go out. What is it? - I don't dare. - Why? - Because I'm afraid of heights. - That's just in your head, okay? What happened to brave? And bold? Don't think? Just do it? I'll go down and help him. Warning! Warning! Space debris. Warning! Warning! Man overboard. Warning! Warning! Broken anchorage. - Albert! Albert, can you hear me? - What's going on? - Albert's drifting free. I can't make contact. - Can you try to approach him? Warning! Warning! Man overboard. Distance 200 meters. Distance 220 meters. Distance 246 meters. 50 meters. 70 meters. Distance 70 meters. 22 meters. Contact. Albert was out cold. It was up to us now. Up to Marcus and me. Asteroid directly in firing line. You have one chance left. Think of the asteroid as a basketball hoop. With the right angle and the right timing— - As a basketball hoop and as a team. Two minutes until asteroid hits Earth. - Okay, let's do this. Five, four, three, two, one. - Now! Gammatron fired. You did it! You shot down the asteroid! - You know what? We did it. There's no I in team. - We did it. - Mariana! Look! So yeah, definitely. Earth is saved. - Can I just say one little thing? You did very, very well. Yes, for two half-finished people that is. Lisa. - Do I get a little help or do I have to land this all by myself? - Lisa. - Fine. I'll land it myself then. No one knows exactly what happens if you go back in time and change what has happened. But one theory says it will be as if you have suffered memory loss. Look, there you are. How did it go? - It went well. This is where this story ends. Albert and Lisa got to grow old together. Marcus returned to the sports camp where the basketball game was still going on. - Great. Jump back in then. Open with a pass, very good. And as for me, I got the best astronaut camp in the world. And I think if someone had asked my young self, you know that girl who didn't quite fit in, who was constantly told, "What you're dreaming of isn't possible," if someone had asked her if her dream of becoming an astronaut would ever come true— then the answer would probably have been a clear no. But—I'm standing here now. A newly graduated space captain. Therefore, I would like to thank Lisa Connor and Albert Mann. For taking me on the greatest adventure ever. I also want to thank Marcus, my brother and best friend— who couldn' t be here today because he's playing a basketball tournament in Tokyo. Last, but not least, I want to thank Lemming who got exactly what he wanted. He stopped the disaster, saved Lisa and became a hero. And I think someday, if Moon-a-Lisa still works, we'll go and see him, because you can't help wondering how he's doing. Right now, as well as there and then. Because time—it's relative.
