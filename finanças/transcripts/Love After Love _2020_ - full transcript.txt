I've been in Hong Kong a while now But I haven't called on you, Aunt That's rude of me Two years ago There was talk of war in Shanghai So we moved to Hong Kong And I enrolled in high school But Dad's savings are meagre So he can't support us They've decided to go back to Shanghai As I understand it... If I'm a good student I can graduate next summer If I go back to Shanghai... I'll lose a year If I stay behind, alone in Hong Kong... I couldn't afford to live... ...or pay the school fees I hesitated... ...and I've decided to ask you for help Dad is so narrow-minded He doesn't know what he's saying I see why you are cross with him If you could give me a chance... ...and bring me up I could be like your own child And repay your kindness They went to Repulse Bay for a swim Not sure when they'll be back Who are you looking for? For Aunt Is there anyone called "Aunt" here? She's expecting me Then you should go to her place! Maybe she's from Mistress's family Our Mistress is out Come back another day I'll wait for Aunt here You keep saying "Aunt" Is she really your Aunt? When Madame Liang gets back... ...you'll know Let her in Don't keep looking She won't be back this early She's persuaded by George Chiao... ...to go for a swim And to dine and dance You're jealous, aren't you? You're the jealous one, aren't you? You can't fool me What makes you think I'm jealous? Admit it! Stop it! Go Away! Go Away! Mistress is back! Won't you come in for a drink, Master Chiao? You must be exhausted... You are early Listen, Ni'er He wants me to join him on the beach But he needed me just as a chaperone He was dating Marlene Chou But her father wouldn't allow it If someone older was there... ...the precious Miss Chou would be safe! That was his cunning plan What a nerve! How dare he! I can act as go-between But I've never been an escort Nor a decoy You can play Prince Charming But I'm not playing your Fairy Godmother! Aunt... Who's your aunt? I'm Ge Weilong, Ge Yukun's daughter Ge Yukun is still alive? Father's still alive and well I once said... When the day comes that Ge Yukun's time is up I'll cheerfully pay for his coffin While he's with us... ...I won't lend him a cent She hasn't spoken yet Mistress, how do you know she wants money? What's it to you? Did she bribe you? I'm here on Father's behalf... ...to make peace with Aunt I've read your letter But Miss... You've thought of everything... ...except my feelings Even if I were willing... I couldn't help If your father found out... He'd accuse me of abducting you Lulu! Come back Naughty dog Did Sir Cheng call? No, but Uncle... You forgot again! Don't frown You'll give yourself wrinkles You're here, unannounced? I rang, but you were out You knew I was going out What if you'd come for nothing? But here you are! The Monkey King never managed to escape... ...from Buddha's palm! Who's this young lady? He's asking you I'm Ge Weilong, Ge Yukun's daughter I came to see... Aunt Ah! You two are aunt and niece Anyone might think... ...you were cousins Does your father know... ...that you're here? No How long do you think you can hide it from him? I don't want to be blamed for coming between you two If Father is against it... ...I will never bother you again Try to make up a lie to fool him Just don't be obvious Can you play the piano? I studied for three years But I'm clumsy Not very good You don't need to be Just learn a few tunes... ...which people like... ...to sing along with All the young British ladies know this trick We follow British ways here I see Your father is old-fashioned Doesn't let you go out to socialise He doesn't know... When you get married... ...you'll need all the social skills You can't go through life avoiding people Yes Getting the chance to learn from her... You're in luck! I leave this child to your care, Mr Situ I... I'll follow Aunt What? He won't do? Listen... I benefitted from his care myself She's yours, I dare not snatch her away! Can you play tennis? If you can, I'll have a partner to practice with I did learn tennis at school I can play a bit You have tennis clothes?

Cheers, everyone That's enough Just for fun We've heard you You sing well! Much better than I do! I wouldn't dare follow you! Know what you look like? Like... ...a Chinese opera mask! Like a mask? More like a foreign devil! I should marry a Muslim Go around with my face covered! I like my face Chinese think you're a westerner And foreigners think you're Chinese Compared with you... ...I look more western I'd be better off going abroad Daddy would agree to send you abroad He likes you, doesn't like me It's the way you behave You get into universities... ...and then keep getting expelled Hand it over What? The money! What money? You went in Dad's car He must've given you some money He must have Come on... Believe it or not, he didn't How much? I don't know We go halves As usual This is an advance on my dowry The British care a lot about this So that British man will marry you? What makes you think I'd marry that idiot? The ones who live in those draughty castles... ...are old maids with no dowry! What am I to the Ge family? No more than someone who brought them shame I rejected the men they picked for me... ...and became Liang's concubine instead Our declining family lost face! Declining families... They're like bricks in an outhouse Plain smelly Madam She won't understand what you're saying That's right She was born too late She missed the drama All the insults her father hurled at me Look! It's like a brothel taking on a new girl! Didi You shouldn't say such things Don't assume Sir Cheng will protect you... ...just because he's taken you for drives What am I to Sir Cheng? If Mistress blames me... ...it'd be your fault for telling her And what would that do for me? I'm trying to look out for you! This way, please Goodbye Stay, Didi! Mistress is always scolding us Don't worry Get up! The girls will clear it up Go and get changed Your parents are coming Why are they coming? To take you home, of course They can tell me what to do? They beg me to take on one of your sisters They'll do whatever I ask ...and bring you back under control So my replacement is here This arrangement must suit you Your own niece here... Keeping it all in the family! Don't irrigate anyone else's fields! I didn't say anything about you and George But now you're going after his father! Taking secret rides in his car Thought I didn't know? He could be your grandfather! You're so cheap You were born to be a slave I may have offered... But he didn't want me! "Born to be a slave!" You're not a slave... But you can't get what you want! Why is that? Exactly! Tell me! You keep me in this house... ...to use me as bait! But when someone takes the bait... ...you can't take it! That's what I mean! I see! Enter The country folks are here Come in Greetings, Mistress No need for that Take your daughter back home She's grown up now Find a decent family and marry her off Mistress is right We have other daughters Might they have the honour...

The Seventh Mistress's new baby... ...must be on your list too ...you must have had the driver too! I've been too kind to her I've spoiled her It will be hard for you when she's back home Kind? Kind? You want me to tell about your 'kindness'? Didi! What? Say whatever you like! Talk to the press! I can always use the publicity You think I wouldn't dare? Come home! - Fine - Don't beat the child No need to beat her I'm the one who spoiled her Just leave It's my fault I'm going... - Go home - I could spend my whole life here... ...and get nowhere! Maybe you should get dressed first You might mess up your hair again Find me something plain We have choir practice today They wouldn't like anything showy I don't understand... You're not a Christian So why join the choir? You're so busy all day long And at night... ...you sit up studying Look at you... These two weeks revising for the exams... ...you've exhausted yourself I don't mean to discourage you... ...but what happens when you graduate? Miss You're still in high school There's only one university here Many graduates can't find work! If they do get hired... ...they earn only 50 a month In a convent primary school... ...bullied by foreign nuns It's not worth it! You think I haven't thought of that? I'm taking it step by step Don't mind me speaking frankly I'm just thinking for you Use the chances you get here Look around... ...and find someone suitable You mean Aunt's friends? Of course Her friends... ...are either playboys... ...or old men stocked with concubines A few are army officers But the higher the rank... ...the less they mingle with locals This is Hong Kong Now I understand! No wonder... ...you wanted to join the choir Even though you're busy I've heard that... ...lots of college students join in too Your aunt is rich My old uncle was the rich one He was one of Hong Kong's leading tycoons He left his properties to my aunt Your uncle was Liang Jiteng? How did you know? The nameplate reads "Liang" I put two and two together It's well-known that Liang had a mansion... ...called 'The White Lodge' So he was your uncle! Not my real uncle My aunt wasn't his legal wife But you are her niece She is she, and I'm me Aunt Climb in, I'll give you a lift Weilong, you go in front Hello, Madam Liang What's your name? Lo Siu-Lun You're a college student? Yes Which year? Third year Studying what? Medicine And when you graduate? I want to intern in a mission hospital Ever thought about further studies abroad? I've thought of it, but I can't I have brothers and sisters I'll need to support their studies Money doesn't matter It's talent that's precious Weilong... We'll hold a garden party next week Ask your choir friends to come Thank you, aunt You're still children... You hear of a party... ...and you get excited Thank you, auntie Poor thing She gets hardly any chance... ...to show off her French Best leave her to it Are you hot? I'm fine Here's the dessert!

This looks good Go ahead I won't I put on weight Enjoy Thank you Try it Really, Hong Kong's best patissier Thank you, auntie Is it nice? Delicious! Really? Then I'll have a taste It's really nice Thank you for inviting us You're welcome Come visit any time you want Kitty! What have you been up to? Dancing! You must show us! I like tennis, but I'm not very good I could tutor you Splendid! I taught Weilong to play In terms of looks, character and education How does he compare with you? We're different species! So you admit defeat! Are you George? Why has no-one introduced us? Why are you staring? Am I like a thorn in your eye? You are And one that I'll never be able to pluck out! I should keep it as a cherished souvenir You're very droll I'm a fool Why didn't I know there was someone like you here? You should save your sweet talk for my aunt She's cross with you Let's not talk about her Let's talk about us I could have missed it Missed what? Missed this chance Really! It's a real stroke of luck We may have been born in the same era... But if I were born 20 years earlier That wouldn't be so bad It's alright if I were older But if you were born 20 years before me... - Then we'd... - That would be... ...just like my aunt and you! You've entertained these boring people all afternoon Shall we rest for a while? Now that you mention it I am a bit tired So... we sit silently As if we're in mourning When two people sit together... ...do they have to talk? It would be nicer if we did talk If you insist... ...I'll speak to you in Portuguese "Love is a fire which burns unseen" "A wound that aches yet isn't felt" "An always discontent contentment" "A pain that rages without hurting" I didn't understand Maybe you're cursing me Did that sound like cursing? I wouldn't dare I'll translate it into English for you Who wants to hear it? I will anyway I won't listen I'm not brave enough Actually, it means... You know how to drink! Weilong Find Kitty to play us a tune The party need livening up Of course Chief steward... Yes, Miss We have guests coming tomorrow My aunt would like your chef... ...to show our cooks how to make pastries Madam Liang's wish is our command Please tell your aunt... ...we'll take care of it Weilong! Kitty... Have you come to see me? I'm running an errand for my aunt Don't go yet I can't go back anyway Aunt is taking tea with Lo Come in, we can take tea too That picture of the Virgin Mary... ...was hung there by my mother... ...long ago She could be herding sheep in Fatima now You miss her? I can't really remember her My brother probably does But he doesn't seem to care much Actually I think you came today... ...to see my brother I came to see you, I love you! Don't get tangled up with my brother! It's not a good idea I haven't got tangled up with him You haven't, but he'll try What's the difference? Weilong You don't understand With mixed-race boys... ...even the best ones tend to be moody Sometimes even a bit wicked Mademoiselles I'm sorry I've kept you waiting Champagne? Champagne? Do you drink? You look quite young How old are you? Never mind, champagne isn't strong It'll be fine Wait You don't even know how to! Let me Madame, thank you Madame Champagne? Fancy a drop, Kuen? I'm joking I know you have work Kitty! Come My friend's calling me What I said... Don't forget! What did you say? I'm not telling you I have a surprise for you Come along! Sit down This is your room? Open it Look inside Don't be scared! Don't be scared I've kept him for three years He doesn't bite That was you mother's? Yes, Ma's hairbrush Do you miss her? My ma has a boxwood dressing table There's a peach-shaped pot on it Filled with baby powder Our place in Shanghai... ...is not as big as yours It's a three-story lane house There's a calendar with a pretty girl's picture Ma always scribbles phone numbers on it One for the employment agency... ...soy milk store... ...and numbers for my other aunts My parents' room is on the second floor On the third, my brother and aunt have rooms And my little sister and I share a room We share a black iron bed Our bed cover... ...is white with red stripes I want that black iron bed Ask your sister to go out... ...so that we can sleep together Hello? Uncle! Hang on Uh... Your button What's so urgent? What is it? Weilong? She'll be back soon This way Wait a moment! What took you so long? Get changed quickly Uncle Situ needs you Could I... excuse myself? No! I'm exhausted Who isn't? Start the car "There's a port about 30km from Rome It's called Ostia, built in the fourth century It was abandoned long ago" But in the ruins... ...you can still see black-and-white mosaic floors" In the fourth century, Hong Kong... ...was probably still a rock under the sea Nowadays there's a big market for mosaic tiles It's because of the climate here It's humid and windy We use mosaics not only as flooring... ...but also for walls and facades "In fourth century... Hong Kong was still a rock under the ocean Now it is a big mosaic customer Because the weather here is wet and windy Floors are best paved with mosaic tiles" Why isn't Sir Cheng here yet? There's a polo contest And George? He went with his father As he always does It's not his father... More the money in his pocket! He is father's son The more squabbles, the merrier Is she your daughter? I wish she were But would she agree to it? Thank you Sir, buy some cigarettes? Those rose-red tiles I chose... Somehow they look wrong now they're on the wall Like a cave of blood, it's disturbing Some shopkeepers use little tricks... ...to make their sales The fact is... When tiles are fixed in place and grouted... ...their colour will be darker That's why they don't look so good I was waiting for you to decide for me But you didn't come back from Shantou So I made the decision myself You're too... ...impatient Is that a token of apology? I like it! Look at this! Who's the impatient one? We're not even home yet and you're handing out gifts! It fits Eh... Miss Weilong You can't refuse me this honour Let me explain These things... they're a pair I can't possibly separate them So I give one to your aunt And the other one to you One day your aunt's will be yours anyway... So it makes no difference Really But... it's too expensive I can't accept it You should never refuse... ...an elder's gift All you need to do is say "thank you" You really haven't seen the world Such petty behaviour! I sincerely thank you As they say, "Drink and be merry!" Weilong Wash your feet, get changed... ...and come down for a brandy! Don't catch a cold Weilong Come down for a little drink Here Thank you George Yes? Have you ever made plans for your future? Yes, of course For example, my plan... ...this evening is to see you As long as the moon is shining I'm talking about further ahead I don't like to think that far ahead There's no point, anyway For example, when my father dies... Don't say that! When my father dies... ...he'll leave a dozen concubines And at least that many sons! Even his favourite won't get much So what hope is there for me? That's why I never think about it Have you ever thought about trying to work ...and support yourself? No I can't support myself Hey! Here! Is it sweet? They're sweet Really? Weilong! Come and try some! We grew them ourselves They're very sweet Wonderful! Sister Come and try it Yellow fruit She says it's very sweet Have another one One more - Thank you - Wonderful I need to tell you something What is it? I don't intend to marry If I did get married, it wouldn't work out Until I reach fifty I'd be a useless husband I mean it I'm telling you honestly Because you're a nice girl Don't waste your time on me I'm not Let's go back up I will, even if you don't I can't promise you marriage I can't promise you... love But I can promise... ...to make you happy What kind of talk is this? I can promise you happiness Isn't that the rarest thing in the world? You'll make me happy? You're torturing me This isn't torture I'm not torturing you There'll be a bright moon tonight What's wrong? Are you afraid? Afraid of me? I'm not afraid of you I'm afraid of myself I'm afraid I'm losing my mind Don't be afraid You're not losing your mind You're not Not yet... You tell me all this nonsense Why do I have to listen? You were waiting for me You're teasing me Me? All of you are! You're exhausted, Weilong You need to be happy Your aunt doesn't care for you I can make you happy Only me I can You know You know everything I know I do know Are you happy? Weilong, you're too good Marry me Love me You're the only one I can't lie to I'm sorry You startled me! I'm the one to say that! You made me jump Good night What did the Liangs do against your family? You picked on Didi And now you pick on Weilong Listen... She's not Didi Oh dear! Are you their avenger? My dear girl... Don't get angry This is a small token Come on, take it Where's your pocket? You think I care about your money? What's that fragrance? Ni'er! You usually fight back! What's wrong with you today? Let her hit me She's pitiful What's going on? Tell me what's going on It's early, Ni'er was doing the washing Miss was disturbed by the noise She lost her temper Go downstairs You, come with me It's very odd What's so great about that Chiao boy? You want him, she wants him... I've made a big mistake I should be punished I'll serve you for the rest of my life If you don't believe me... Today... I'll take... ...a vow of chastity You haven't offended me It was Miss Whether you stay or go It should be her decision Miss came to you for help And Mistress provides her everything Mistress should have the final say You see that she's poor... ...so she needn't be respected I treat her as one of my family If that's what Mistress says... Well... There's no way out for me You may go Miss, your breakfast is here Weilong How can you treat me like this? How will I explain to your father? I'm sorry, aunt It's because I trusted you too much I wasn't watchful enough, and this mess You're going to ruin me Aunt It was my mistake Nothing to do with you I'll return to Shanghai If people start to gossip... ...and my parents hear of it... ...I swear I'll take all the blame myself Definitely, no misunderstanding... ...will be laid at aunt's door You plan to go home That's well and good But right now... ...is not the right time to go I won't stop you going I'm ready to hand you back to your father But aren't you aware... ...how vicious gossip circulates Before you even reached home... ...rumors could be spreading And have reached your father's ears It was my mistake, I'll take the blame You've ruined your prospects You'll never marry a decent person Who can say where you might end up? There's nothing I can do about it Anyway... I never want to see Hong Kong again As you wish Welcome, Mr Situ Hello You're back! It went well? Not bad Did you behave? No And did she? Her? She did Behaved herself to death! Have some soup Can't you even keep a good eye on her? Why are you so angry? Is she yours or mine? You think I keep a brothel here? You can come and go as you please? How could I? Your mansion is Hong Kong's finest And Miss is your treasure Then what do you have in mind for my 'treasure'? I'm no expert on the Chinese But I've done my research If Weilong's family wanted to talk to me... ...it would be to pressure me into marriage They'd want the whole thing hushed up Marry her? Would you marry her? Don't you know my answer? I have no choice I have no money, I live a cushy life I was born to be an imperial son-in-law Dream on! Which emperor would have you? So it's better I don't get married Then tell Weilong... ...to forget you Would she forget me if I told her to? Don't quibble You won't marry her... ...because she wouldn't keep you for life! That isn't true Stop pretending You can't play the romantic Who are you looking for? Er... Ge Weilong Who are you to come asking? Who are you to come asking? Weilong has flu, and a fever We've sent for a doctor Who was that? Why was he so hostile? He got here very late yesterday You woke him, so he's grumpy Don't make a fuss I'm taking some classmates to the golf course I said I'd borrow a car That's no problem Very sorry Service is suspended because of the weather We apologise for the inconvenience Service is suspended because of the typhoon Please wait for further announcements, thank you Mistress Miss is back I see Wait Tell her to wash and get changed... ...and then come down for dinner Uncle is here Let's see how much weight you can pull! Go and have a cigar Leave us to have a heart-to-heart talk Did you get a ticket? There's a storm, the steamer isn't going I need to bother aunt for a few more days Now we are family It seems to me... ...that you're destined to stay here Destiny is punishing me I should never have come to Hong Kong So you're blaming me... ...for keeping you here? It's all my fault I let aunt down If you really want to put things right You should make George submit And when he does... ...you can drop him Or have fun with him if you prefer That is prowess Letting him go... ...would be too easy on him Aunt Me and George... ...are through That's because you've treated him... ...the wrong way from the start He's sure your heart is fixed on him That's why he blows hot and cold... ...and doesn't take you seriously You should spend more time... ...with other people He doesn't care about you But plenty of others do Aunt Thank you for considering my future But I've decided to go home This again! You keep talking about returning... ...as if that solves everything! I'm sorry, aunt When you came here, you were one person Now you are a new person You've changed So your home needs to change too You think of returning to your old life But you probably cannot I know I've changed I didn't like my old self But I don't like what I've become either I want to go back And become a new person "To Aunt" Give it back! These are my things! Stuck-up bitch! Damn you! You won't live long! Bloody hell! Quick! I'll get it from this side, you go around It's so big! Quick! Where's it from? Master It belongs to Master George Let it go What's going on? It's mine That's my snake Spoilt brat! Right! That's what I am! You made the mistake of fathering me Get out! You drove my mother out And now it's my turn You're dreaming! You invoke your mother? You have the nerve to call her? Mum! Mum! Mum! Master? Let it go I'll yell if I want to! Mum! Daddy, no! Sorry Daddy! Aunt George doesn't want to marry Is that mainly because of money issues? I have no money But I could earn some Earn money? Unlike you, I won't use a dead man's money I'd rather use my own A dead man's money? You don't even have that! Will your father leave you money? I'm still young, I can try Who wasn't young once? You think being young is everything? We'll have to see You're young, but George still dropped you At least I was still young when it happened Not like you... Long past your prime... ...but your desires are insatiable You'll never know real love As far as I can see... ...the way you look for love is ridiculous That's not the whole story I'm not only ridiculous I'm also transgressive How much gossip is there about me? But what is gossip? The wider gossip spreads... ...the more it stirs curiosity It just boosts your prominence It won't damage your future one whit There's just one thing... ...you need to avoid at all costs That's when... You love someone And the person doesn't love you Tell me How will you earn money? I didn't ask Uncle for a single cent But he gave me that bracelet, didn't he? Ah, this child! So Uncle pops back into your mind! He started out being so kind But you just pushed him away! As if that bracelet would bite! If you ask him for things now... ...he won't know if he should give you sweets or roses In case Miss rejects him again! "Too expensive!" Don't imagine that because you're quite pretty Can manage some conversation... And know a few English songs... ...that people will shower money on you! In my opinion... You're too thin-skinned, vulnerable... Too temperamental and too indecisive You fall prey to your own emotions Not well suited to this kind of work I will gradually pick it up You have a great deal to learn Aunt There's one thing... Can you do me a favour? At this point I can't just wash my hands of you What is it? Aunt, please ask... ...George's father for permission I must be properly married But George himself must agree The day will come... ...when he needs me We'll try Thank you, aunt What about Ni'er? Let her stay Who would have thought... ...that a sweet kid would grow up to cause such trouble If things had been different then... ...there would have been other sweet kids... ...and not mixed-race ones, either! You can dream Our dream was all too short If only old Liang had died sooner! You're taking your time too! After you That bastard! You fathered him! You have to swallow the bitter fruit Fine, I'll give him to you Do what you want with him He could be your driver, your handyman... Whatever, as long as I don't have to see him What if he becomes my nephew-in-law? Marry your niece? I've seen her Rather a decent girl Don't waste her on him! You might think it's a waste But she dotes on him The child is set on following him She even says she'll support him And you approve? I'd feel sorry for her No matter what It's better to keep her in the family... ...than to let her go elsewhere... ...and be bullied by strangers So there's no bullying within the family? Who'd be bullying who? Of course Under your watchful eye... ...there'd be no bullying The young miss says... ...she wants a formal marriage Then we'll do it properly I'd come up with a betrothal gift And we'd get a dowry in return You cunning old fox! We're all getting old Tell me What do you want to do with me? Marriage No I can't get married Why not? Weilong is not good enough? I'm not good enough I can't control myself Weilong will control you She can't You'll have to compromise You want to marry a rich girl? Your standards are so high! She has to be rich enough for you to consider Even you could find that girl... ...she'd be spoiled She wouldn't be as easy-going as Weilong Your freedoms... ...would be curtailed You need money to enjoy yourself What's the use if you can't enjoy yourself? Taste the wine Try one, they're fresh This is how they eat them in France You pick one up... lean backwards... Bring your mouth forward... And elegantly suck it in It's certain that... ...after seven or eight years Weilong's income will be greatly reduced When she can't pay the bills any more... ...you can get a divorce In British law... ...it's not easy to get a divorce The only grounds for divorce are... ...adultery And finding evidence of that... ...should be easy, shouldn't it? Good girl You'll finish school next year You'll go back to Shanghai? No Your diploma will get you a job in Shanghai Will you go to university? I'll get married To whom? George I'm going to college in Canada My aunt will sponsor you? As you know, my own family couldn't afford to George wants you as his best man Fine Come... Let's get ready Let's start shooting Bride and groom Smile! Smile! One more One, two, three You prefer Shanghai or Hong Kong? Hong Kong's scenery is wonderful If I could swim I'd probably like Hong Kong better I'll teach you to swim One, two... Weilong Come over for a toast Coming This is for you Thank you, Father Aunt Thank you Cheers Congratulations Thank you Treat her well Of course Let's have lunch I told you to stay away from him Now you know what I meant I'm not afraid of him But he's afraid of you He's always been an idler But he's making an effort for you Making an effort?
