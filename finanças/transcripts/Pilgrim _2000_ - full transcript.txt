Help me... Jesus. - Please... - It's okay. You're safe. Don't worry. Here. Drink. Easy... He seems to have a normal pupil response. No sign of brain damage... but I think you should really get a scan. Brain damage? What happened out there? Did you get in an accident? Where am I? This is Mexico, son. This is Mexico? You're in San Felipe. Don't you remember where you are? Mexico...? Woman: ls there someone we should call? A friend? Anybody? Man: I will drive you to a hospital. It shouldn't take more than three hours. No, maybe I should. No -- I'm gonna be fine. I'll be fine. Once... ...this clears up, I'll remember. Do you remember your name? I don't even remember my face. Try not to worry. Temporary memory loss... sometimes happens with a bang on the head. But, it usually comes back pretty quickly. Don't worry. Doc knows what he's talking about. Like, usually...? Usually it'll come back, but there's no guaranteem? Well, that depends. Memories usually come back in a piecemeal fashion. You know... little islands of memories in a big black sea of nothing. Are you remembering something? I was making a phone call, right here. (speaking in Spanish) This is Jaime. He seems to know you. (in Spanish) He wants to know who trashed the phone booth. I don't know. I don't know. Entonces... you come for your car? Oye, amigo... I tind this next to the telephone. Is yours, si? "Jack Kelly." All right, I'm Jack Kelly. See the money? It's all there. No touch. Real estate agent, Boston, Massachusetts. Jack Kelly... okay. I wonder what I'm doing here? Maybe I'm here for business. If this is your car, how come you ended up in the desert? I have no idea. "Motel La lmmaculata." It's a rundown place on the other side of town. "Stubbs" -- do you know a "Stubbs"? "Stubbs"... no. Never heard of him. Okay. I'd probably be dead if it wasn't for you. What's your name? - I'm Vicky. - Vicky... I'm Jack. Right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. - Take care. - Yeah. Ah, SeQor Kelly. I thought you got lost. No, I've just been busy. SeQor, what happened to you? It's nothing. Just a little accident. That's too bad. You had a caller last night. I told him, I don't know when you are back. Who called? Didn't leave no name. You know what? I lost my key. SeQor... keys cost a lot of money. Seeing as it's you... Okay. Thanks. How long have I been here? How long? You know how long. Remind me. Is this a joke, or...? Please, please. Remind me. Two days. Two days. Did I say what I was doing in town? You said something about "a change of scenery." Okay... Gracias. "You have reached Richard Stubbs. I'm not here right now, but leave a message, and I'll get back to you." Shit. - Motel La lmmaculata. - Si, seQor. Jack Kelly. - Ah, SeQor Kelly... - Hello. Give me -- I want my office in Boston, okay? Area code 617... 555-0100. Jack Kelly. Okay, Mr. Kelly. Seeing as it's you... Oh, my God...! Hello? I'm sorry, Mr. Kelly, but the international lines are busy. You want I should try again later? Mr. Kelly? Mr. Kelly? Yeah. SeQor Kelly! Are you checking out? No. Not yet. Stubbs. Hi. Iclean... No, that's okay. It's clean. - It's better I clean... - No, no. It's fine. Gracias. You are bleeding, SeQor -- It's just an accident. It's okay. Gracias. Okay. Yeah? This is your wake-up call, Jack. In more ways than one. - Who is this? - Very funny. I'll see you in hell, 12 noon. Who is it -- ? Fuck. Please, can I just pay for my gas, please? It'll only take... Okay, sorry, sorry. Ma'am, please, it'll only take me one minute... Let me just pay for my gas. Sir, I'm in a rush -- Here, here. Take it. Take it. It's all yours, all right? Son of a bitch. Violating a traffic regulation. What? You're violating a traffic regulation. Oh... I'm sorry. Iran out of gas. No gasoline. Look, I'm kind of in a hurry. I don't mind paying... an on the spot fine. Let me see some ID. Okay... here you go. Next time, you better watch out. Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, definitely. Don't park in this area. Yeah... okay. Gracias. Have a nice day. You got a leak. No, I spilled the gas. It's hard to do without a funnel. Dropped my KEYS- - Better watch out next time. - I will, I will. Gracias. - Motel La lmmaculata. - Yeah, this is Jack Kelly. Get my bill ready. I'm ready to check out, okay? I'm a real estate agent from Boston. Business must be good. Hola, SeQor. How far is the border? You think I'm some kind of idiot? What? What's the problem? - That's the problem. - What? I got through to your office. - What did they say? - They say you are dead. They said you died two years ago. Dead? How can I be dead? Look, here's my driver's license. - It says "Jack Kelly". I'm not dead. - You pay cash, or I call the police. - I'm not dead! - Cash, or the police! Oh, my God. Here. If you're not a dead man, who the hell are you? What the hell is this? We've been set up! Hey! What's going on? Hola. Five dollars. He's clean. Would you excuse us? Sit down. Please, sit down. Your meeting with Mr. Hogan... was a bruising experience. You must have been surprised to see him down here. Me, on the other hand, you must have known I'd find you. There is nothing you can hide from me. I always know where the bodies are buried. I always know where all the bodies are buried. After everything I told you about covering your ass, you go and trust Stubbs. That is a bad slip, Jack. I did you a big favor. But right now... I'm only interested in one thing, getting back what belongs to me. Where is it? I just need some more time. Jack, I'd be sorry to lose you. Yeah... I'd be sorry. Decision time. You look like hell. What's the point of threatening to kill you, if you're going to die on me, anyway? That's better, eh? We're supposed to be on the same side. You got itchy and made a run for it. We all make mistakes. That -- was your last mistake. L... like I said, I just need a little more time. There better not be a problem. No, no problems. So, my friend here has a place on the beach. That's where we're staying. You got three hours. I'll be waiting for you. Thank you. She's cute. Don't be a disappointment to me... Mr. Morrissey. "Morrissey"? Morrissey... Excuse me... - I'm off work... - Please, I need to ask a question. - I don't think so. - A minute of your time... - I'm going home. I'm sorry. - Just one question. Having a problem, Vicky? Nothing I can't handle. The boss has a special guest that wants to buy you a drink. Rafa, you know I buy my own drinks. Hey, Vicky... No. Consider it a career opportunity. I don't need a career opportunity. Hey, hey! She said she doesn't want to go -- 0Que te pasa, pendejo? Rafa! Stop it. Enough! Can we please talk, now? Yeah. So, your name's not "Jack Kelly", it's "Morrissey". Gracias. That's what he called me. HMOrrisSGS/Il- Who is that guy? I don't know. I don't know, but... he sure as hell knows me. You do know Stubbs, don't you? Yeah. I don't really know him, I know his wife, Heidi. She works in the club, waiting tables. - Heidi. - Yeah. She's been kinda scared these last few days. I guess he told her there were some dangerous men coming into town. And now, he's missing. When I asked about Stubbs, you thought I was one 0t them? Well, yeah, I thought that. So, was I wrong? I don't know. I don't know. And that's why I need your help. I live alone, I work so I can paint, I occasionally have a wild game of Scrabble. That's it. That's my life. How could I help you? You could tell me where Stubbs lived. - "Lived"? - Lived. Listen... I'm pretty sure it was the guy in the club. It's not me. But I gotta find out what's goin' on. Please. Just give me one good reason why I should think about helping you. Truthfully? 'Cause if you don't, I'll be dead in three hours. Hello? It's 10:30. Where the hell are you? I told you I had to have it tonight. I can't wait another day. I'll give you ten minutes, then I'm gonna go back to... Stubbs? It's Hogan. He was there, all right, but the bastard got away. It he contacts you, string him along, and I'll be in touch. Woman: Smile! You guys, smile. You look terrible. Why don't you go get us some beers, honey? And while you're at it, why don't you cover up a bit? You're gonna fry out here. You want a clean ID? Yeah, I can do it, Jack. Takes three weeks. You sure you wanna do this? Yeah. Means no more Macauley. It means getting up in the morning, and doing whatever you want. Good for you, Jack. You got it. Jack...! Heidi? Where's Stubbs, Jack? Is he alive? Jack... Heidi... He's not dead, he's not dead... Heidi, listen to me. I need to talk to you, okay? What I want to ask you is gonna seem very weird, but you have to answer these questions for me, okay? Okay, come on, let's get a drink. I remember this picture. L'm not sure exactly why -- I took it. That's when he began to get suspicious. You see, he never knew that we... had a thing before he married me. Heidi, you must know me very well, then. God, Jack -- even atter all those times we were together, I'm not sure I ever did. Did I ever tell you anything about myself? My family, my friends? Where I was from? - Anything? - The way I remember it, I did most of the talking. Stubbsy was making me something. Did he make it? Do you know that, or was he gonna sell me out the whole time? I don't know, Jack. I swear, I don't know. But, he didn't sell you out for money, or nothing. You know, he always liked you. When I knew you were coming to see us again... we had a big fight, the worst one we've ever had. I never seen him so crazy. He just kept asking over and over, do I still have a thing for you? Finally, I got mad, and I said... "Yes... I d0." "l d0." Oh, God. I think it broke his heart. If only I hadn't said anything... Heidi... whatever happened to Stubbs... had nothing to do with you. Goodbye, Jack. Maybe it's not such a bad thing, if you forgot who you were. You're much nicer, now. Bye. I know, I know. It's Hogan. Your local people fucked up. Hogan slipped through their fingers. But my boy's on it here. He never lets me down. Listen, don't you threaten me. I know what the funds are intended for. I said, it's being dealt with! Can you believe this shit? Very impressive, Jack. You see how good he is? Real professional. Yeah, he's clean. Did you think you could delete your tile that easily? This is what you're looking for. It's portable this way. Easy to turn over to whomever I want. I mean, if necessary. I hope you haven't come empty-handed. - We need to talk. - Good. I'm listening. Alone. I don't believe that. You wouldn't lose that kind 0t money. I didn't say it was lost. I'll get it back. I tried to give you a little rope. I figured you went a little crazy, and needed some time to think about things. But... enough is enough. - Have I ever let you down before? - You lied to me. You steal from me... and now you have the audacity to ask me that? Answer my question. Have I ever let you down before? Yes, or no? "Yes, or no?" You don't think I'm capable 0t having you killed? ls that it? I just need 24 hours. Give me 24 hours, you'll get it. I want you to think about... all the people you've betrayed, and lied to, all the people you've stabbed in the back. All I have to do is turn over the file, and -- the real you gets exposed. You're the best liar I've ever met. You're a natural born liar. And you know what makes you so good? That's all you are, a liar. A bunch of lies, that's all you are. Because that's how you wanted me. Oh, yes, absolutely. But now, you've changed. You've started lying to me. How do you think that makes me feel? I don't know. I'll be honest with you. lam in trouble. If my superiors knew that you had deliberately... screwed up the last operation, there'd be nothing... nothing I can do to save you. Jack... You've got 24 hours. Go. Get out of my sight. Oh -- God! Sorry. It's you. - It's me. - Whoever that is. Very cute. Well, you're alive. This is good. You must have found what you were looking for at Stubbs'. Yes, and no. "Yes and no"? What does that mean? It means I need your help again. Uh-huh. What can I do? I think I buried a suitcase in the desert, next to a very big cactus. And I can't remember where it is. Why'd you do that? What's in it? It's a long story. But if I don't find it, I'm in big shit. So, what do you want from me? Do you remember when you first found me? Do you think you could take me back to that place? It I could at least start from there, maybe that would trigger something. Wait, wait, stop the car. ...it's 10:30. Where the hell are you? I told you I had to have it tonight. I can't wait around another day. L'll give you ten minutes, then I'm gonna go back -- I'm not quite as dumb as you thought. Eh, Jack? - Where's my goddamned money? - Fuck you! Very funny, Jack. You think this is funny? I jumped out of the car right here. I thought they were gonna kill me. I jumped out here. Same guys who killed Stubbs? No. - What is it? - It's a luggage claim. Maybe it's for the suitcase. I thought you said you buried it under a cactus. Maybe I was wrong. The only place that does that is the bus station. Do you mind? Are you gonna open it? Sorry. It's those guys. Let's get out 0t here. Man: Stay away from me! I'm gonna kill him! Jack, back off, Jack! Back off! Hey, you all right? You okay? No. What's in it? Clothes. Just clothes and stuff. Nothin', really. - That's it? - And this. - But I thought that -- - I know. So, are you...? I don't know. Well... if it ain't Jumpin' Jack Flash. You're a hard man to find, Jack. It's almost like you're tryin' to avoid me. Cool it. Whoa... you haven't introduced me to your friend. Cleopatra. "Cleopatra"? Well, Cleopatra... what's a nice... Egyptian girl doing with a piece of white trash like Jack? Go wait out in the car. You see, me and Jack... we recently embarked upon a little business venture together, in the world of high finance, you might say. But, Jack -- Jack just isn't a team player. Isn't that so, Jack? Let go of her hand. She has nothing to do with this. Let go of her hand, and you and I will talk. I think our relationship has gone way past the talking stage. - Our what? - Relationship. What do you know about our relationship? You don't even know who I am. Who do you think I am? I think you're a lying, devious, piece of shit. - Ever hear of a guy named Macauley? - Should I? - Never heard of Macauley? - What the fuck are you talking about? - Do you know who Macauley is? - I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck who Macauley is, and I don't have time for this. I want my money! Jack: Go, go, go! - Truck. - Okay. Take that guy out! What the fuck...? Keep him down! Get out 0t the car! Get out! Come on! Stay down. Stay low. Thanks. Get the car! - You wanna go to a hospital? - No. I'm okay. I'm okay. Just keep driving. Shit. Right. Damn it. Go! Go! Move! - They're too fast. - Go to the desert. Okay, okay. - That's it. - What is it? Stop the car. That's it. That's the cactus. This is what I saw in my dream. I was looking in the wrong place. I buried it here. I had to wait in town, because Stubbs didn't have my papers ready. I didn't want to be carrying around that kind of money with me. This is it. Jack, they're coming. - This is it... - We'll get the money later. Come on. Look out! Shit. That's it. We're walking. Think we lost 'em? I hope so. Let's get off this road. How far is your place? It's just a couple of miles this way. Why don't you dump the suitcase? It's just clothes. No, I can't do that. You came here to break away from your old life. That's what I did. I was becoming someone I didn't like. One day, when I woke up next to a dead man with a needle stuck in his arm, I knew I had to get out. Yeah, but I didn't make it. I just ended up lost. That scares me. What I'm remembering about my life scares me. And what scares me more... is what I can't remember. I can't promise anything. Me neither. Jack: Smells nice. Hey. - Good morning. - Morning. - How are you doing? - Good. Good. I gotta walk the dog. - Want some coffee? - Sounds great. Vicky: Come here, boy. Mac: We all make mistakes. But that was your last. Jack: It wasn't a mistake. I robbed an armored car with these guys. I was supposed to bring the money to Mac... but I didn't. Not this time. Mac: There is nothing you can hide from me... I always know where the bodies are buried. A bunch of lies, that's all you are! Yeah, I can do it, Jack. Takes three weeks. It means no more Macauley. Sure you wanna do this? Hey, boy. Come here. What's going on? It all came back to me. I kill... I cheat... I steal... and I lie. That's what I do. That's who I am. Thanks for your help. Don't mention it. - I don't care about that. - Sit the tuck down, motherfucker. I can't hear you... Shut up! I'm on the fuckin' phone to my broker. - Tell him to put his gun down. - I don't think so. Put your gun down, now! - Do what he says. - Sit down. Put the magazine down, take the gun out of your lap... put it on the table. Now. Sit down. Think you're pretty clever, huh? Smarter than the average criminal, right? You're so fuckin' dead, Jack. Sit back. Now. Let's put our personal feelings aside for a second, okay? Just listen to me. The only way you're going to see any of that money... is if you and I go into business together. I don't have very good memories of the last time we did that. You listen to me. Remember the guy I was talking about? Macauley? He and his men got the money, all of it. The only way we'll see a cent 0t it, is it we hit him together. You and I. Now. We split it 50/50. Decision time. You gonna be clever, Hogan? Or are you gonna remain unpaid labor? Get in. I thought it would be better it you were a silent partner this time. You better pray Macauley has the money. Hogan: Tell Macauley I want the money, or I'll torch this place! Man, you could have killed me! Wasn't even close. Clean yourself up. Mac wants us. What the hell are you doing? Trying to get us all killed? - You know me, don't you? - Of course, I know you. Let go of me. Am I "Jack Ford"? Richards, tell me. There's only one guy who knows for sure -- Macauley. Stop asking me this shit. Are you ready? Let's go get these guys. Go! When you made a break for it, I was kind of envious. Why don't you just walk away from him, then? He's got me by the balls, like everyone who works for him. He's got a file on you, too? He's got a file on all of us. "Fifty-fifty", eh, Jack? Were you lyin' again, Jack? Jack, you... You all right? Oh, yeah. I'll live. Hey, man, I got something for you. It's from Stubbs. I got to Stubbs' house before Mac did. - Richards...! - Yeah. I figured, why should he have everyone by the balls? Where's Macauley now? Jack, forget him. You're finally away from him. Please, where's Mac? He went to get the girl. He figured that -- - The girl...? - Vicky. How long ago? An hour. Call an ambulance. - Jack... - Thank you. Nothing. - So, where is it? - I don't know. Where the hell is it? - He said he buried it here... - Maybe he was lying. Maybe you are lying. Maybe you are trying to help him. Mac! Ah, Mr. Ford. How nice to see you again. What's goin' on? Didn't I tell you I'd get you your money? You're late. I told you 24 hours. Well, I'm here now. Let her go. Your gun, please. Thank you. Doesn't matter... she's dead, anyway. Fuck you. Fuck you both. I like her, Jack. Under different circumstances, I'd even say I approved. I know what you are, honey. You are a 28-year-old, college dropout... who spent nine months in prison on a possessions charge. I still get a kick out of the look on their faces when I do that. - I wanna make a deal with you. - A deal? No. I have had enough of your deals. In fact, I'm coming to the conclusion... that I've had enough of you. You thought you could kill us all. You thought you could kill me. I could be across the border by now, but I'm not. I'm here. Well... you're here because you can't run. You're here because Stubbs didn't deliver your new life. No, you're wrong. Stubbs delivered. Posthumously. Birth certificate, passport, everything. Stubbs... "Pilgrim". That's cute. You could have vanished. I made a mistake. I'm back. Tell Sanchez where the money is, and we can get out of this lousy country. You let her go, then you get your money. That's the deal. You know, things don't work that way, Jack. Well, they do now. What the hell is this? What do you care what happens to some junkie? It's just the way I want it, Mac. Okay, okay. Let's deal with the money first. The money, Jack. Let her go, then you get me, and the money. Go on. Get in the car. Go ahead. If that's what Jack wants. See? I can be reasonable. I'm not -- I'm not a monster. - Sanchez -- - I'll do it. You realize that the girl won't make it as tar as the border. I can't let that happen. But, it was the principle of the thing, right? Careful, careful. Slowly, please. Careful. (chuckling) What's so funny? Nothin'. What is this? Don't fuck with me. Why not? I don't know you. What are you talking about? Where's the money? I don't remember. That's bullshit! That's bullshit, right? No... it's not. That crack you took on the head? Yeah. Tell me who I am, Mac. Maybe then I'll remember where the money is. Tell me. Mac: Get the file from my case. In the meantime, we can start with a little overview. You are human garbage. I picked you out of juvenile prison, because one thing separated you... from the rest of the scum you lived with. You had potential. You were intelligent, and very violent. Thank you. Here, Jack. This is your life. Great reading. Really, it is. When I first read it at the beginning, I knew you were something I wanted. Because... because no one else did. No one else. It starts here with your birth certificate. Hello, Jack. You don't know me, but I made it my business to know you. Come on, kid. Today's your lucky day. When I first read your file, I knew you were something I wanted. Because no one else did. No one else. Decision time. Do we have a deal? Jack. Is this what you want? There you go, Jack. Say goodbye. Pull that trigger, and you might be able to get that tile. But you'll never know what I know. I'll make it easier. Kill me. Kill me, and it's yours. Can't do it? Of course you can't. I'm more to you than what's in that tile. I'm the only flesh and blood you've ever had. I'm the only person... who ever gave a shit about you. Nothing -- nothing in that file matters. I'm what matters! You, me... that's it. Mac: Jesus Christ, Jack... Sorry, Mac. What's in there? Nothing. You never had a name to begin with. Nope. We should probably get out of here. So, where is the money, Jack? It's gotta be out there somewhere.
