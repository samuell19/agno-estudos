THE 1001 PERVERSIONS OF FELICIA I think it was pretty odd to name her daughter Felicia. But I always maintained that your friend Vicky was a little crazy. Felicia... I think it's a pretty name. Perhaps, but she still has a lot of nerve. To expect you to look after her daughter after not writing for six years. Of course the great Mrs. Benson had to leave Australia ... ... to treat her middle-class depression in a Swiss clinic. Ah! There she is! A bad guess. Still... she's nice to look at. Ah! That one! Felicia! - Did you have a pleasant flight? - I hate flying. In that case, you must be very happy to be here. Come on, we'll go get the car. I hate cars. The house isn't very far. Just past Deauville. - Quite close to the sea. - I hate the sea. Let's go... If we squeeze in a bit... Two women sure take up a lot of space, compared to one man. I'm sure the three of us will be very cosy together. I never wanted to come here. This is your room. Do you like it? The bathroom? In here... Three weeks with her around is all we need! Oh well... I think I'll fix us some lunch. You have a class at 2:00 this afternoon. She must be tired from the trip. Her eyes looked terrible. She does have nice eyes. She's pushing 16, right? Yes, but with the mentality of a 12 year old. I really wonder where to start with her. We take her by surprise. And then show gentleness. Watch the hands. Check the stove, will you? When I see you use all that energy for roast and puree... You hate it, honey. - Yes, but I want you more. Aren't you nervous today? - You're making me nervous. And instead of fooling around with me why don't you go help her unpack? Or you can stir this. I'll take the lesser of two evils. Felicia! What are you up to in here? Unpacking my stuff. I hate unpacking stuff. I can see that. Can I help? Gabrielle was a bit like you when we first met. I managed to set her straight after 10 years of marriage. No one's setting me straight. That's the lack of a father. Leave me alone! That makes you happy, doesn't it? - What does? Having touched me. Seen me. Squeezed me. Come on, Felicia. All men are like that. It's all they think about. No harm done. I won't tell Gabi. You don't look too bad I guess. For a teacher. I was expecting worse. Where's that innocence that a girl your age should have? Me? I'm a virgin. What were you thinking? That would surprise me, considering the way you're behaving. Right. Don't get any crazy ideas. - Perhaps you should get dressed. This is my room. You're in my room! For lunch... I'm not hungry. - We have roast, puree... I hate that stuff. - We can always boil you an egg. Well? She's bitching and not hungry. But she's got a lovely ass. It's hot today, isn't it? Not really. Maybe it's Felicia's unpacking that got you all hot. Lunch is ready, this isn't the right time. It's always the right time. What about your marital duties... It's noon, and you have a class at one. I want you. Come on, there's something small to start. And then you. - Paul! And then you... Then the roast, and the puree. And then you. You're crazy. - Crazy for you! You're obsessed! Not here, what if Felicia showed up? My roast! Aha! When I catch you, I'm going to rape you! Oh, yes... Faster... Faster... No... not like that... I want to come inside you. With you. No, no. Wait. You're very lovely but just not exactly what I was looking for. Oh well, I'll call the agency while you get dressed. Thank you anyway. I'll leave you here and go make that call. I'm fed up with these artists who never know what they want. Too bad. She was very sweet. For a moment there, I figured she was a lesbian when she began to caress me. And you're the one who always says don't mix business and pleasure. There's always hope, you silly. This is the real thing! She's not poor, I can guarantee you that! Hey! Are you crazy? What if she walks in? I heard her on the telephone. As long as she keeps talking, there's no danger. - But it's wrong! - Oh, nonsense! We're safe! If they're fake, it makes no difference. And if they're real, it's worth a try. Someone's in the closet! Leave me alone! Give it to me! Give me that! No! If you grab it, I'll scream my head off. And I took a very pretty picture! Gabrielle will be delighted to see it. Alright, what do you want? Who are you? What does she want? What will she do with it? Nothing... if... If what? What if she walks in? There's no danger. Go on. Show me what you were doing. - What? - Making love! - Why, she's absolutely crazy! - No... just curious! You go for girls, too? You've never seen two women making love? Hurry! You've turned us off. It won't work. Go on, just pretend. I'm afraid! That's not bad for a start. Come on, hurry! Hurry! I'm telling you Brigitte, he's not here yet. Can you ask him to call me back later? Sure. And if you want to come by on Sunday you're more than welcome. Thank you. Bye. That's enough, time's up. And the photo's? You moron. I don't even know how to use this. Now get dressed. Hurry. Can I come in? Are you ready? Ah, Felicia. Are you interested in my work? How about you? We we're looking at the photos with her. Too bad we can't work together. You talked with Felicia? - A few words. She's charming. Bravo. - Why? Forget it. Let's go. This place is a joke. What a day. She didn't say a word all night. Not to talk, not to eat. She'll start eating when she gets hungry. Not a smile, No sign of interest. I wonder if there's anything that interests her. Leave it, I'll get it. - Of course, dear. Marie and Line, the girls from the agency... I think they make a cute couple don't you think? Did that never tempt you? They say two out of every three women have lesbian tendencies. What about you, honey? A little boy... to do things for you you shouldn't be doing? You silly. You're all I need. But maybe... something different. Even just for once? This time, it's true. You lack imagination. Hey now! Lunch seems so far away now... I feel you're hungry again. - For you. For you. I know, I know, I know. Just a little dip first. I case you want to know, Brigitte called. She said she'd call back. Hello? Is that you, sir? Am I disturbing you? I wanted to ask you to forgive me for what happened at school. I must have sounded so stupid. Yes, yes. It really won't bother you if I come Sunday with my uncle? Oh... thank you professor. Thank you, Paul! - I'll dream about it all night long. - Sure, sure. Goodbye! - Wrong number, darling? - It was Brigitte, sweetheart. You know, I really pity that girl. She's head over heels in love with you! Nonsense! She's still only a child! Oh, only a child? No doubt she thinks of you when she plays with herself! Me too, when I was a schoolgirl. I also thought I was passionately in love with one of my professors. I used to do it, too. You never told me that, you little vixen. Now, as punishment... No... you're not going to make me regress into my neurotic childhood. It was fun though, wasn't it? It was better than nothing. Until I met you. It relieves you, when you don't have a man standing by. Darling... if you want to try her... - Try who? Your little Brigitte, who else? I'll let you do it, Paul. Because I love you. And because I have faith in us. In you. Because our love can only last if each is free to do as he wants. That's very sweet, may dear Gabi... but for me, freedom means loving you. Sharing everything with you. You know that. I do. But... if one day you weren't really in love... but aroused by a girl who is younger... more beautiful... You're crazy. What's gotten into you, Gabi? It just occurred to me that after 10 years of marriage... I repeat - there's only one woman for me. And it's only you that I love. Then... love me. Show my how much you love me. You're so strong. Am I hurting you? It doesn't matter, it feels good. Yes... hurt me. Oh yes. Oh, Paul. Oh my love. What is it? Did you hear something? - What? What is it, Paul? We've never locked the door before when we're making love. Only people with a guilty conscience do that. But Felicia? Felicia? But there's no one there. Felicia doesn't care what we do. And she knows married couples make love. I have an idea, Paul. It's so lovely outside. The full moon... Let's go outside. You can't be serious. - I'm very serious, my love. Why make love only in our bed when the whole world is ours? Make love to me. Fast and hard. Come on. I'm nervous. - My love. I love you. You didn't come inside me. You were too fast. You excited me so much. I couldn't help myself. Let's go. The best in me is hungry. I hate them. I hate them. She's already asleep. She doesn't look happy, Paul. That's because of her attitude. Or it's because she's unhappy and alone. Can I help? Sure, if you want to burn your fingers. I can take it. - Pass the herbs. Felicia is a real handful of trouble. I wish we could do something for her. I warned Paul. Young people aren't easy. Even with René we didn't know what to do. And we've known him for 18 years. So you shouldn't expect miracles in only two days. Is that her? Felicia! Come down. The lamb is ready. Shit on all of you. I hate lamb! Who's hungry? And for René, the biggest one. - Not too well done for me. Not too well done. A sausage for me please. Gabrielle, what about the photo book? You said it would be done by summer. I haven't found what I'm looking for. Do you know what you're looking for? Like all artists... - True. I'm looking for a certain kind of purity. Very simple. Classic. Eternal and modern at the same time. I'm using big words now. It sounds idiotic. Honey, you want some? I don't get it. The purity. Do you think that will sell nowadays? Yes. If you know how to bring it. Unaffected, sincere... but not sentimental. I just need the right model. Maybe try it with a male model? A little androgynous perhaps. Like the adolescent in Death in Venice. Maybe. But as long as Felicia is here I can't really concentrate. Then let's hope she leaves soon. - You said it. Felicia. It's the first time I've seen you look happy here. It suits you. Will you pose for me? - I don't know how. That's alright. - What do I do? Whatever comes to mind. Let the sun and flowers inspire you. What are you doing, Felicia? I'm posing. - I can see. I meant the pose, not you. But it's not pretty that way. - So I'm ugly? Not bad for your first time. I've found my model, Paul. - Who? Not bad. Not bad at all. - That's all? What would you have me do? Jump through the ceiling? No, I'm kidding. She's great! Now to find a theme. And you finally got her to smile. Felicia, can you hand be the bread? Paul, your waist! What? I like bread with my fruit. Felicia, the bread please. She was very pleasant all day. - Where are you going? To see if she's alright. Darling, she's got you wrapped around her little finger. If you fall for this... Felicia, honey? - No. No one likes me... It's because I'm ugly and bitchy. My darling, don't think that. I love you. So, consoled, tucked in and sound asleep? What is it, Gabi? - Nothing. Why? I don't know. You seem different tonight. Good or bad, it's exciting. Looking at the photos I get the feeling Felicia has a crush on you. Or the other way around? Don't be ridiculous. Watching you two I feel... How to say this... Jealous. That is ridiculous. Like all men in love... And tonight... Tonight I'm in the mood... I'm in the mood... Touch yourself... for me. And I'll touch you like a woman. Will you... for my pleasure? My darling... It turns you on as well. I can feel it. Touch yourself. Feel yourself. Look at yourself. You're very excited. See how I touch you. Oh my love... keep going. I can't... Not standing up. You know I don't like it this way., - Keep going. You're beautiful Look at yourself. Look at me. look at me. That's it... I'm coming. I'm coming... I'm coming. I can't, not standing up. You know I don't like it this way., Look at me. - Shut up. Why, didn't you like it? You don't hurt me. Who taught you that word? Who? Hello, who is this? - Guess who... Oh, darling. What is it? - Guess... A big secret I forgot to tell you this morning. I don't know. - Good news. What is it? Tell me. Today I love you even more than yesterday, and less than tomorrow. I'm sorry, Gabi. I'm wicked. - No, you're not. I'm just unhappy, that's all. You're not mad anymore? - No, honey. You're so hot. Like a firestone. You make me horny. What did I say now? René. - That pig. And what else did he teach you about your sexuality? That I'm frigid. - That imbecile. I hope you don't believe him. He's an animal. Show me. Teach me. Do me a favor. Just this once. Oh Gabi. Please, Gabi. I was pretending. It means nothing. - It means nothing to you... You're a good actress, Felicia. That can come in handy. Later, with men... But don't goo too far. You'll regret that in the end. Of course, honey, you're still young. One day, you'll meet a man like Paul. I mean, a good man, and he will teach you to be a real woman. And that's it. Love. And you can't teach me because you don't know? I can't do that, Felicia. Are you afraid I won't be a good student? Or afraid you'll be too good a student. A great little seductress. What are you saying? - Nothing. I think Gabi finally found her style. This girl is truly, what's the word... ingenious and perverse... young and troubled, right? Exactly. Not bad. Look at this. You should put these on to protect your eyes. The world looks blue. The look good on you. Keep them. Thanks, Paul. I'm going for a swim. Who's with me? I'll race you, Gabi. - Felicia has exhausted me today. I can't have any tan lines. You've got a point. It's better. Do you remember the other night? - Paul, you're blocking the sun. Who do these belong to? - Guess. A papua. Good morning, Miss Australia. You look happy this morning. Hands off. - But still frigid I see. Says Mr Freud. - If you ever need my advice... I'll call you. - 223429 Not a chance, kid. She's a lesbian so if she ever needs any advice... Where's Felicia? I don't know and don't care. We see her all day long. So, you're going into erotica, Gabi. It's not a reproach, my dear. Quite the opposite. Not very swinging. You're right, they're all... Cute couple. - Yes. But look at Paul Felicia is here for a few weeks. She can't do too much damage. We'll see about that. I forgot to lock the door. Gabi. - What is it sweetheart? I had a nightmare. I'm scared all alone. Can I come in? - Of course, Felicia, come in. So even after midnight we can't be alone here. I came here for Gabi, not you. - Same thing. No. - Yes. What do you want? What does she want? She wants to sleep here. No way. - It will be fine. Gabi, are you nuts? What about me? I'm here now, you can sleep. No. For once I want to take advantage of the situation. How so? - You. You promised to teach me. - What? All I don't know... about love. That's not true. I told you you have to wait. I can't wait any longer. - Wait until you are in love. I am... with you. - With a man. Men! Even my mother warned me how dangerous they are. Because my dad made her happy, and then gave her a kid she didn't want. Me. Funny, isn't it? Don't say that. Your mother loves you. Possibly. And you? Do you love me? Tell me how. Show me, show me. Show me, show me. There's no danger between women. There is. You could fall in love. Become jealous... rivals... And soon you will leave. And one of us will suffer for it. Do you understand, sweetheart? Why are you crying? - I don't know. Because you love me. You love me! You love me! Don't play with fire. It's dangerous, Felicia. You're crazy. - Yes. And so you'll have to do what I want. Or else... Yes. Good. Gabrielle! Gabrielle! Wait for me! You didn't answer. Was it better nor not with Paul? I want to know, Gabi. Was it better or not? It was good, but different. It's hard to explain what a couple is. Do you love me? - Yes. Do you love him? - Yes. And does he love you? - Yes, in his own way. And do you love his way? Yes. I like the way he loves me. I think he loves the way I love him. I think that's what a couple is. - That's not very complicated. It's like happiness. Simple and complicated at once. Strong and fragile, rare and precious. Come on Gabi, again? Are you asleep? No, Paul. - And there's nothing you want to say? And there's nothing you want to say? Are you angry? - Are you angry? I'm trying to understand why, after 10 years of marriage... But I love you. - and fidelity... I'm not cheating on you, because I'm not hiding anything. And freedom was part of our marriage contract. It's still the first time you profit from that, and it hurts a bit. I didn't know I had to ask for your forgiveness. I'm sorry. That's not the issue. Paul, just get back at me. Sleep with her. I have no desire to. And you don't understand that it makes me sick. That you do it and I'm left behind. Desiring only you. What about it? She's been in there for 15 minutes! I have a class in an hour and I haven't eaten or taken a bath. You haven't shaved either. You feel like a porcupine. Felicia, my bath. You two figure this out. I'm going to make breakfast. Do you have any croissants? - What do you think? Drain the bath! Now what are you doing? That's my razor! Shaving my beard. - I'll teach you. You could get dressed for a change. - It's too warm. That's no excuse to walk around naked. Where are the croissants? There's only bread. You're on a diet. - I don't care about my diet. I know it's a pain but there's no need to be a jerk when she's around. Are you done playing the whore? You hurt her, Paul. My bath, my toilet, my razor, my croissants. And then... my wife. What do i have left? Don't you see, I want to see her cry. But cry for real. Not like a girl with a heart of stone. Don't be mad at him. I don't want things to change between the two of you. You know how men are... They're animals. You have to know how to take them. And you, you don't know yet. And the photos this morning? Yes, the light is fantastic. On the terrace? - Yes. Wet your lips. Smile at me. That's it. Now, put your hand on your breast. Now, look at me as if you are trying to seduce me. Don't answer that. It could be Paul, it's about time. Don't answer that! Hello? - Hello. Gabi? Is that you? I didn't recognize your voice there. I want to apologize for this morning. I was being a fool. What are you doing? - Nothing. Are you with her? - Yes, Paul. More pictures? - Yes, but now she's taking them. Yes... What's Australia like? - Big. Many sheep, English people... buildings and deserts. I'm happy here. There, I'm not. But you have lots of friends. I don't like people my age. They're so childish. Especially the boys. The girls are mean. And the older people... Are no fun. You're young. Younger than me. Did you ever want to die? For real? - No. And you? Once. I was so miserable and unhappy and alone... I just couldn't take it anymore - What did you do? Here, see the scar? You were serious. My god, when? A year ago. On my 100th birthday. Do you believe me, Gabi? You should never believe me. Especially when i'm telling the truth. Because it's so sad. Do you understand? You'll get it when you get to be my age. I mean when you're that unhappy. I don't know. But that's for later. You have time. And Paul. That's true. I can rely on him. - But he's mean. He treats me like a child, just like my mother. He thinks he's better. My poor mom. Did you see how she lost it? That was funny. - Felicia, don't say that! Sometimes you're so heartless. - That's what my mom says, too. But secretly I was crying. I always hide. I always hide when I cry. And if you see me crying some day don't believe it. It's for fun. Don't upset Paul. Promise me? Do it for me. - I'll do it for you. I promise. Since when do you smoke? - Since now. Keep still. - You're the one who's trembling. I am? Thank you. Since when do you say thanks? Since you started lighting my cigarette. If you smoke like that it won't last. - You can always light it up again. Not really. I have no time today. Look at all this stuff I have to grade. See, I'm wearing panties. No reason to show them to everyone. First, I'm not showing them to everyone. - I'm honored that you let me see them... Second, you don't have to look at them. Third, I was wearing them for you... hardly worth the effort. I would appreciate it if you wouldn't just leave these lying around! When did you start drinking straight from the bottle, Felicia? Nice salad.... What did... what did you put into that? With that apron you're less indecent. You like like a showgirl from Pparis. That's not a compliment... Ouch, I hurt myself. - Don't move, let me see. Does this hurt? Hold on to me. Let's go. Are you alright? - Yes, I'm fine. A little higher... Higher... It's not your foot anymore? - No, it's all the way up my leg. It's my thigh. Maybe it's the sciatic? Are you sure? Does this hurt? - No, that feels good. Paul, that hurts! Stop! That's good for you. Gets the blood pumping. And look - you're cured. Paul... Paul... - You little slut. First the wife and then the husband? Forget it, I don't want you. You and your theatrics... That was just for fun. For fun! For fun! For fun! - That's the last time. Paul... I love you! I love you! I'm exhausted. It was so hot today. Don't worry about a thing, honey. I'm making dinner and I'll set the table. I love it when you do that, Paul. Why are you looking at me like that? You're sweet. By the way, how did things go with Felicia? Oh, fine. - No arguments? No... no... Hello Gabi. Paul said everything went well. Here, for you. He gave me a spanking. - A spanking? It seems I got on his nerves a bit. So he ripped off my skirt and panties. He made fun of me wearing them. He said they were like a little girl's. Then he spanked me. And he... What? What did he do? He... we... It can't be true. I'm sorry, Gabi. It happened so fast. He almost... Do you still want me? You're right, I'm bad. I told you I was no good. - Shut up. Voila, dinner's ready. And this one isn't as deadly as the one Felicia made earlier. What did she tell you? The truth. The spanking, and everything else. Leave me. Good night, children. "And what is ""everything else""?" What? Come on, hit me. It turns me on. And if it helps you too... Goodnight, lovers! What are you doing? Like you, whatever pleases me. Listen, I swear to you... You chose to say nothing earlier. At least that's better than lying. Between that lying brat and me, you choose to believe her? You gave her a spanking, so something happened. You were keeping that from me. I'm upset because you lied to me. At least she had the guts to tell me what happened. God knows how embarrassed she was. Much like you are now, I bet. Now leave me. Gabi, let me explain. Let me... Gabi, open up. It's me. Gabi, please. Are you angry? You don't love me anymore? It's not you, sweetheart. I still want you. He bears the blame for this. And the worst is, I hate lying. Oh, Gabi... Oh yes... Yes, that's it. Oh yes, like that. That feels so good. Yes, keep going. I love this. Gabi... Oh Gabi, I love you. Oh yes, like that. Oh, your tongue... Yes, touch me, yes... More. More, Gabi. Hello, Paul. I love it when this infernal machine finally stops. Me too. - I'm not surprised. The garage called, you'll have the car back tomorrow I'll pick you up later then? - Thanks, but I think I'll walk. What is it, Paul? - Nothing. Brilliant! If I have to choose between a girl and a bike, I'll take the bike. I hope you change your mind someday. About Sunday, I have too much work. - You and Gabi could come here. She's been feeling a bit ill but I'll tell her. And Felicia? - She's welcome too, of course. You can always come alone, Paul. Don't bother. I'm not hungry and you'll be late. Felicia's not ready yet. She's getting dressed for a change. You sure you won't come, Paul? Don't you think that between us, I should be the one that's angry? Fine, if it makes you happy. Ah, nice choice, sweetheart. It looks great on you. Like a snake in the grass. - Come on, Paul. Let's go, Felicia. What? - What? Why did you come back? - Why do you ask? Maybe for you... You're wasting your time. - That would surprise me, Paul. That's enough, Felicia. - Paul... Oh yes, Paul... Paul, I love you. I love you. - Shut up. Paul, I love you. - Shut up. Paul, do it. Do it! Oh yes, Paul. I know you want to. Take me. Yes, like that. Like that, hurt me. That feels good, keep going. Paul, take me. I want you, keep going! I'm sorry. That's bad luck. Aren't you too old for superstitions? You should be ashamed! I'm sorry, I'm a bit distracted. It's the same at home Tired perhaps. - Paul said you weren't feeling well. It's nothing. - He looked very worried. Maybe. We all have something, right? And Felicia? Are you happy with her work? Very. I never thought I'd find someone like her. Pure and perverse. Soft and hard. Tender, yet violent. Woman and child. I'll miss her, and yet... - I hate yer. She's strange, but... - She's very interesting. You have to learn to accept her, understand her, even love her. Gabrielle, I imagine you're giving a lot of yourself to her. And everything she gives me , too. And Paul? - What about him? He's a man. Not always the most tactful, And it's not easy for him, the two of us. Of course, Gabrielle. If only you knew how it was between Jacques and René. Girls, you just need to know how to use them. Isn't that right, dear? Yes, but a boy isn't as complicated as a girl. Can't you talk like a normal person? I am, dad. You're the one who's talking like a professor. It's getting late, I have to go. - But you just got here. I'm sorry, I really have to go home. - If you're tired I can take you. No, that's fine. But I have to go now. Stop that, or you'll get me all wound up again. I've already had you twice tonight, isn't that enough? No. I bet we could find a third opening if you want... The belly button. Relax, you nympho. I find it hard to believe that you were still a virgin. That was my surprise. Do you love me? I've shown that. The first time I've ever had a girl in this way. You're not just saying that? - No, I never lie. Me neither. Except when I have to. And Gabi? With Gabi? - That's different. Is it because of me you're angry at each other? A little. But we're not really angry. You don't sleep together anymore. That's too bad. It is. But you shouldn't stay here. What if Gabrielle comes home. She 'd could imagine a lot... - Exactly. One more minute, Paul. - No. I've thought about this moment so much. - Really? Besides, it's not so late. - And we'll hear her come in. Do you think she saw us? Enough for one night, go on. Gabrielle. Don't touch me. I hate you. - I love you all the same. We need to talk. - It's too late for that. Something happened tonight... - It's not possible. between Felicia and me, and that concerns you. You can skip the details. And don't leave these rags lying around. You, who loves order so much. Gabi... - No. Get out. Paul, we can't leave Gabi like this. - I'm not locking the door at night. Do you remember? Do you want to do me a favor tonight? You'll do everything I say? Everything I say... - Yes. Good. Where are we, Felicia? - Everything I say. Everything. Everything? - Everything. Yes... Everything you want. I love you. Gentle, my love. Yes, like that. My sweet girl, gently. Felicia, my love. Don't stop. It feels so good. Oh yes... Keep going. I'll do everything you want. So gentle. Everything? - Yes. You promised. - You tricked me. I'm sorry, Gabi. I was wrong. Forgive me. Stay here tonight. And Felicia? - Her too. We shouldn't play with fire. Oh yes, Gabi. Yes, like that. Yes, both of you. Oh Paul, keep going. Gabi, I'm hard in you... We both turn you on, that's why. Lick me well, Paul... You're so soft, Felicia. I like it like that. It's good, both of you... And me Paul! My love, you make me feel so hot... Oh, my love! Felicia, you'll miss your flight. It was good, with the three of us. - And afterwards, Gabi? Afterwards... I don't know. Maybe I'm just being stupid. My little Felicia. - Goodbye Paul. And thank you. Goodbye, Gabi. - Oh my sweetheart. She left nothing behind. Least of all her heart. Only a memory. Maybe it was all a dream. Maybe we needed someone like her. For both of us. Do you really think so? And so, life goes on. Do you want to go to Deauville? Can you give me a ride? It will be a tight squeeze, but I'm sure we can manage. Isn't that right, dear? You're going to Deauville? - I go where people take me.
