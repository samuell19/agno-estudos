I'll tell ya, glad you're here. I didn't think you'd make it. Heard they're closing the highway tonight. Not yet. Fire's still 65 miles out. Yeah? Thanks. Cheers. You're sweating like a pig, Barrett. - What's the buy-in? - Hundred bucks. What's the game? - Texas hold 'em. - Guy's robbing me blind. So, what, it's just the three of us? Where's Carl and everybody? Well, he's up at Fort Yukon. He won't be back for a couple weeks and... Wade's got his boy tonight. What the hell is his name... - Matthew. - Matthew, yeah. - Hey, are you in or what? - Duty calls. Hello? - Did I wake you? - No, I'm up. How was your meeting? Well, all that's left are the signatures. - Good. - Drive was a stretch. - Where are you now? - Lou's. Okay. I think I might go to bed. 'Night. 'Night. All I'm saying is you have to have options. That's all. Without options, you're gonna end up finding... You young kids, you're only out chasing a buck. You don't know the meaning of the word principle. - A man's gotta have principles. Am I right? - That's right. But think about how much money you'd make selling this? OExcuse me if I'm mistaken, but... ...people still need to eat and drink, yeah? Alright, but think about the competition? - You got... you got... - Are we gonna finish this hand? Yeah, big corporations and chains, franchises breathing down your neck. - Yeah. - We've got to move with the times. Now, when we have a republican in the White House... - ...come November, I'll tell you this... - What the fuck are you talking about? We can only hope. And I'll drink to that. - Cheers. - How do you live with yourself? This hand will never change, will it? Excuse me, we're closed. - Fucking kids. No respect for anyone. - I got it. - No, no, no. Don't do anything, just... - Lou, stop. - Maybe you didn't hear our friend... - Can I have... ...the early bird special? What? The early bird special? With a glass of water, please. You need to go right now. No. I can't. I'm hungry. Maybe you're not understanding what I'm saying. Do you... do you have a wife... ...that you have to get home to, Mitchel? Is it Mitchel? Is your name Mitchel? - Do I know you? - I don't know. Just be straight with me. I'm being straight with you. Can I have the early bird special? Please? Get the fuck out right now. Get the fuck out right now. One, two. So what's going on? What the hell was that about? Why'd you speak to him like that? I'd have done a lot more given the chance. Well, who the hell was he? I don't know. I don't think he was from here. He was... Maybe we should call it a night. Hey! I told you we're closed. - Morning, sunshine. - Hey, Sam. Is this too loud? Not even a little bit. - Coffee fresh? - Made it this morning. You're an angel, Mags. Heaven sent. - Tell you that too much? - Nope. That's a good thing. Want to know why? - Why? - 'Cause I ain't never gonna quit. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Where's Rosie? - She's on cleaning duty. - No school today? - Yeah, not till 9:30. I got another complaint about room 128. Hey, Sam, I was wondering, could I pick up a few extra shifts before the holidays? - Thinking about going on a trip. - Trip? Where you thinking about going? Don't know yet. Any ideas? If I were you, I'd just head out to Spruce Valley. I was thinking something more like Florida. - God. - What? - You don't go to Florida on purpose, Mags. - Why? I'll tell you one thing, I'll tell you that, 'cause Florida... Florida, it's not a trip. - It's a death sentence. - What are you jaded? Jaded. Spell jaded. There's no end to my wisdom, Mags. One of these days you are gonna realize that. You coming to the game? What kind of question is that? Am I coming? What do I always tell you? "I'm the best goddamn point guard the Mustangs ever had." It's not just the best, it's the most generous. - Never underestimate the power of generosity. - What are you looking for? - Papers. Where are the papers? - Right here. Thank you. Of course I'm gonna come to the game. - I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Good, 'cause I need a ride. Well played. You got me. Are you going to Bernadette's for the wake? Well... ...I think we all should. It's real nice of her. Considering there was no public burial. There's no... ...there's no words for what these people are going through, Mags. No word. - Disgusting, every single time. - Well, go to the store. I'm sure it's just two miles down the road. It's walking distance. Mr. Barnes, it's the manager. Fucking hell. How you doing, Mr. Barnes? It's Sam. You know, I'm the manager here at the motel. I think we met a few days back, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Look, I hate to bother you, I really do. I... - I like to... I like to let people sorta... - What do you want? Well, unfortunately there's been a couple of complaints here about your room, see... - ...and... I'm just... - Wait a second. What kind of complaints? Well, noise, sir. There's quite a bit of noise I here coming out of here... ...and if you could just do me a favor just try to keep the noise down. Sure told him? I laid it down, didn't I? Good day at the office, sweetheart. Do good. You alright? Yeah. We were wondering where you were. There's a big turnout down there. Josephine thinks somebody should make a speech. I wanted to thank you for... ...putting all of this together. That's all. I gotta run, it's my mom's waiting. What am I supposed to do with all his stuff? We just threw Mitchel's stuff out. 'Cause Mom says it's part of the cleansing process. A fresh start. He was a man, Lila. I know. I know what you're saying. I do. - You're not alone. - I'm sorry. I mean, listen to me complain. You and Mitchel didn't get three years of marriage. That doesn't mean I've got it any worse. Maybe they're some place better. In peace. Maybe. Still haven't shed a goddamn tear. Eighteen years of marriage... ...not one. It's disgraceful. You shouldn't talk that way. I wasn't the best wife, Lila. I could've been better. You look organized. It's all Tom. Well, Tom didn't really trust the banks. Did he? Nope. Mitchel just always thought he was avoiding taxes. Yeah, everyone did... ...but he was right. Why pay someone an arm and a leg to keep what's yours? You let me know if you need anything, okay? - I'm so sorry, Bernie. - Yeah. Me too. Fucking mess. Cheryl's having nightmares. Girls too. What's the chief say? Well, it's his jurisdiction, but... ...he's talking about bringing some boys from upstate. Last thing we need, city officials... ...flashing their badges, asking questions. Well... ...people want answers, Marty. - Am I interrupting? - No, not at all. Just on my way. Once again, Bernie, my condolences. - Cheryl gives her love. - Thanks. - Sam. - Yeah. Christ, Bern, I... ...don't know what to say. You don't have to say anything. Yeah. Your hair's getting long. I need to cut it again. Yeah. You think I could come by tonight? I don't know, Bern. You think that's a good idea? Elwood? Ever been to California? - What? - California. My mom was from there. El Cerrito or some shit. Born in 1949. You ever been there? - No. - No. Think I wanna go there. Why did you kill those men? I did my job. It was supposed to be just Mitchel. That's all. I sent Miles a picture. The one from last Christmas 'with the beige sweater... - ...'cause I remember... - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This isn't Miles' deal anymore. - I did what had to be done. - I didn't ask for this. - Those other men didn't deserve... - Your husband wasn't coming out of the bar. It is as simple as that. I was told he was gonna be out by midnight. So whose fault is it? They think it was a robbery. Fuck! You should be celebrating. Tell me when I'm gonna get my money. You don't have to worry about it. It's all taken care of. Okay. When? - Didn't Miles expl... - When? This week! I'm gonna go see our la... Mitchel's lawyer. I'm owed 50. You remember that. There's plenty. Mitchel was good with money. Why did you want him dead? Did he beat you up? Something like that? No. No. He was always cheating on me. Mitchel was a fucking pig. There you go. I'll give you my number. Call me if you need. Maybe if all... this all works out, I... ...I'll take you to dinner. Movie, something like that. What? No. I'm just kidding. I don't need to tell you what's gonna happen... ...if I don't get the money that I'm owed. You understand? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. I brought you a book. No one saw me. I really wanna cut this hair. For what? You just wanna put me in a beauty contest, don't you? It's a lost cause, Bern. No, you're not. I love you. You're out of your mind. You're a good man. Tom was a good man. Right? Yeah. I don't know, Bern, it's just... - ...I liked him, you know? - Yeah. Where do you think he is? I don't know, Bernie. Heaven. You really believe that? No. I think he's still here. - I can feel him. - Yeah. He'll always be with you, Bern. We hadn't made love in five years. I don't know. You get weighed down by convenience... ...I guess. You can't overlook something like that. Hi. - How ya doing? - Oh, sorry. My name is Elwood. 'Kay. Sam. - Hi, Sam. Nice to meet ya. - Yeah. I'm staying in room 125. A pretty girl checked me in a few nights back. I said that I'd be out by this evening, but... - ...there's been a slight change of plan. - Yeah, no problem, let me just... ...just check the book. You said... - You said, what, 1... 125? - 1... 1-2-5. That's the one. I was hoping I could just hold on to it for a couple more days. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, room's all yours. It's... Oh, great. Just doing my job, is all. - You a Nazi? - Sorry? Oh, the... ...used to belong to my grandfather. He took it off a German soldier there in the war. He use to tell us that he used it too. He never would've made it home without it, he said. What happened to the man that it belonged to? The German did... - ...did your grandfather shoot him? - He said he didn't. I guess he just... found the guy there. He was slumped under a tree and he was holding on to a picture of sweetheart, so... - How'd he die then? - I don't know. Broken heart, I guess. - Better than a bullet. - Yeah, maybe, maybe not, right? - I'm real glad we got this worked out... - Holy fuck! Holy fucking shit! - What? - I knew it. I knew it as soon as I saw you outside. That's you! You're the young rodeo champ. - The bull rider, Russo. - Well, Rossi. - Rossi. That's what it is. - Not so young anymore, but, yes. Man, my daddy would have a heart attack if he could see you right now, you know that? - Is that right? - He's a Virginia man too, like yourself. - Okay. Which part? - He raised me in Lynchburg. - Okay. Okay. Yeah. - Yeah. Wow. He used to drive out to all your shows. He used to go out of state too. - Wyoming, Tennessee. - Okay. He used to save all your newspaper clippings with your pictures... ...he worshipped the ground that you walked on. Okay. - Wow. - Yeah. Hey, you must get recognized here. Right? It must get on your nerves all the time. People coming up to you and everything. No. I mean, up here people, they don't know about that. If they did, they forgot. Doesn't really bother me either way, so... - They're fucking idiots. - Well, you know, it's just... ...it's far away from Virginia is all, so... - No, no. - It's really not. - Alright. - Yep. - See you tomorrow, Sam. - Well, I'm glad we... - ...get to... - Holy shit. Do me a favor, say hello to the old man for me, alright? - What? - I just... ...pass my regards to your father. I can't do that. He's dead, so... - Sorry to hear that. - Nah. I'll see ya. Yeah. Sorry about the wait. Can I get you something to drink? No. No, thank you. - So, Miss McCabe... - Lila, please. Lila. I don't really know if it's my place to discuss such a formidable matter, but... ...were you aware of your husband's financial difficulties? "Difficulties?" His troubles? As you're probably aware, I hadn't seen Mitchel in a number of years... ...so this is relatively new information for both of us. Anyway, I ran some credit checks and I called the taxation department... The taxation? Wait, I don't understand. Your husband was bankrupt. - I'm sorry to be the one to lay that on... - No, no, Mitchel was an entrepreneur. A businessman. He had thousands of dollars. How much did you really know about your husband's businesses? Two former partners were suing him. He's had run-ins with the IRS for several years. What about the will? The insurance? He showed me papers, I... Those policies don't exist. I have bills. I have expenses. I'm sorry, but... ...none of that carries any weight. It's of no consequence and now... ...the bank owns your home. But I... I still need to make a payment on the casket. It was solid mahogany. I can't give that back. If... ...if I had known about... ...any of this, then... ...I would've thrown that monster out with the trash. Thanks. Close the door behind you. - Hey, hey. - Shit. Hey. Been painting the town? Something like that, it's a retirement party. Hope it wasn't your own. How 'bout you? What are you doing up so late? Causing mischief? No, not at all. Just can't sleep. Was thinking about going to that diner there up the road, grabbing a bite. - It's pretty good. - Yeah? - Wanna join me? - I appreciate it, but, no, I gotta work. - Oh, come on. - No, no. I gotta work. Shift starts at midnight, but you have a good time. I'll have you back before 12:00. Promise. Come on, Cinderella. - Alright. - Yeah? - Sure. - Should I drive? No, let's... let's take the truck. Let me lock up. Thank you, ma'am. Sure you don't want nothing to eat? Nope. Just... just coffee for me. That's it. - Not sure how you do it though. - What? If I was eating all that sugar, I'd be bouncing off the walls. - It doesn't affect me. - Is that right? Look at that. Steady as a clam. Okay. - No offense. - Hey. Hey. It's alright. None taken. - That wasn't a dig. - I understand. What... what is that, anyway? - The... with the shake? - My hand there? - Yeah. - Yeah, it's... - Is that rude? Okay. - No, no, no. I guess I just took one too many falls, you know? Got bumped on the head. You see, doctors, they call it early onset, see? So, I guess it's only going in one direction and that's just... ...you know, that's just the way it is. Thanks for keeping me company. I didn't know if you'd be up. It's alright. Haven't really been sleeping much lately. Yeah. Me neither. It's like every time I close my eyes I have a nightmare. Mom says I used to get bad dreams as a girl every summer. And she used to have to sing me Christmas carols to get to sleep. - Did it work? - I guess. You miss riding? Ever? To be honest, no, I don't. - Yeah. - I just don't. I mean... ...I can see how a fall like that can put off any young rider. Even you. - Yeah. - But now you're in the motel business. Yes, I am. The place belonged to my brother so I got it from him. How's that? Well, he... well, he died, you know? Didn't have a wife, didn't have kids, anything like that so I guess I was next in line. Man. You know... ...when my mother passed she left me with nothing, either. Nothing. Her only son too. Imagine that. But she had it tough. Full-blown tuberculosis. Spread like wildfire. - She was a skeleton by the end. - Jesus. I'm sorry... My father wasn't around to take care of her either... ...'cause he was serving time in El Reno, Oklahoma. He shot a federal judge over a previous conviction. Grand-theft auto, I think it was. But he got his comeuppance. He was stabbed in a prison riot. Christmas Eve, 1996. They said he was dead before he even hit the ground. So... ...what goes around comes around. Okay. What flavor? - Surprise me. - Okay. - Let me give you some money. - No, no, it's fine. So you got a woman? Must be a woman in your life. Yeah, a woman, yeah. You know, I don't... I don't talk about it much, but... ...yeah. Yeah, I guess there is, I guess. I guess, yeah, I guess I got a woman. Yeah. She special? Yeah, she is. - That's good. - Yeah. Make sure you hold onto that. I mean, my parents' marriage was built on damn lies, you know... Wait a sec, is that... hey, Lila! Hey. Hey. How are you? - Hanging in there? - I'm okay. I'm surviving. - How are you? - Okay, good, good, good. This is... this is Elwood. He's staying at the motel, he's... - Hi. - He's from Virginia, same as me, so... - Hello. Nice to meet you. - You too. So, what brings you out so late? Some milkshakes. We're watching a movie over at... Which one? - What? - What movie? It's... it's an oldie. - It's with Rock Hudson. - Oh, he's awful. I should... get going. - Bernie's waiting outside in the car. - Is she here? Okay. Yeah. - It's really good to see you. - And you. - Yeah. - And nice meeting you. Wow. She's pretty. - Hey, I'm going to hit the head. - Okay. Give me a minute, alright? What'd you go for? Chocolate. - You okay? - Yeah. - Why? - You look pale. No. I'm just tired. Tom? Tom, a bird just flew into the window. Tom? Tom? Tom? - How long have you been fucking him? - What? Sorry. Sorry. You want me to sing you a carol? I'm okay. You're saying that you don't believe... ...the major problem, the major moral issue confronts our country today... ...is not pornography, it's not sexuality, it's not abortion... ...it's not liberalized education or any of these other things... ...that we typically identify. The real basic moral problem in America is the lack of confidence in one God. Well, yeah, that's absolutely right. The lack of not only the lack of confidence in the word of God... ...but the lack of submission to it is the absolute point. Even I would... I saw the most gross obscene, pornographic stuff... ...painted in frescoes... ...in the first century in Italy. ...just bent on sexuality... ...heterosexual scene and... ...homosexuality, where they wanna rape the angels that show up, they're so base. Even abortion. If you go back in history, abortion has been done... And, so, those aren't the issues. The issue is all of that runs absolutely rampant... ...when there is no fixed standard. And this nation... - Sam? - Yeah? Bernie's here. - You alright? - Yeah. Yeah. - I'll tell her you're in the shower. - Okay. Yeah. - Hey, Bern. - Hey. Hey. Sorry to drop by unannounced. Rose said you were taking a shower, I just thought I'd wait. Yeah. So, what, you just... you just in the neighborhood or... I thought maybe... ...you might wanna come over for dinner. Tomorrow night, I mean. - But, you know, if... - No. I... Yeah, it sounds great, but... ...you know, I do have plans tomorrow, so I don't know if that's gonna... - No biggie. - It's Maggie, you know, playoffs. I told her I'd take her to have some... just I gotta do it. Okay? That's nice. Well... You know if you wanted, I could come by later, you know, after I drop her off... ...if that's... if that's good to you. - I'd like that. - Well... - Alright. - Yeah. Rose, thank you. It was nice talking with you. - Take care, hon. - Bye, now. Okay. Ma? Hey, Ma? It's me. It's your son. It's your son, Ma. Yeah, it's your boy. Miss you. I thought you were dead. Hey, Ma. Ma, listen. I'm out of state right now, okay? I'm working though, and I'm making some money. And I'm sorry I haven't called in a while. I love you, Ma. Ma, do you hear me? I love you. Fucking faggot piece of shit. What? What did you say? What'd you say? What'd you say? You got a fucking problem? Yeah, fuck off. Keep looking at me. Keep looking at me, you fucker. Keep fucking looking at me. Look at me, you waste of life. Look at me, you fucking waste of life. - I'll fucking kill you. - What the fuck you looking at? Pick up your fucking phone, you cunt!

Just for a little bit. I've been sitting around the house with nobody to talk to. Does he want me to bring Mitchel's cat? Okay. Yeah. I know. I love you too, Mom. Bye. - Where's my money? - I don't have it. I don't have it. I don't have enough. I can get it. I can get it! I can get it! I can get it! I can get it! Please, please. I can get it. I can get it. - Please. - Where are you gonna get it? I know where. What the fuck you looking at, you fat asshole? Fat fucking piece of shit. Look at me like that again, I'll knock your fucking teeth out. You look like a fat fucking woman, you fucking bitch. Are you Paul? Paul Anderson? - Who wants to know? - I'm a friend of Miles. He said you're reliable. Alright, just... give me a second. Okay. - So Fairvale? - Yeah. It's a pretty small town. - When's the job? - Tonight. - Tonight, tonight? - Yeah. I can't do it tonight. I can't. I got a date tonight. I made reservations and everything. It's French food. I can't. French food? You want this money or no? - You got a gun? - I ain't shooting nobody. It's just for protection. If not a pistol, then something sharp. - Those things'll kill you. - Bullshit. My grandfather still smokes. He's 83 years old. He's healthy as a horse. He'll be dead soon. Defense. Defense. Defense. Defense. Defense. Defense. Bronwyn! Bronwyn! Come on, let's move. Let's go. Let's go. You alright, champ? Never better. Yeah. You'll play 'em again next week.

Sam, you would've been the best dad to her. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody saw you. - Can I come in? - Yeah. Can't get your game? No one can. Football seven days a week only at the Fairvale Wing Factory. Please drink responsibly. There's absolutely no words to describe this... this atrocity... ...that occurred in our city... ...and our department is working diligently... ...to bring those responsible to justice. Please pray with me for the victims' families in this trying time. That was police chief Kyle Kerry speaking earlier today... ...at a press conference about the Fairvale mass... Hey. What time is it? It's late. - Don't do that. Hey. - No. I tried so hard to be quiet too. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Why're you dressed? Morning. Good morning. Gotta go. You don't have to. I'll make breakfast. You can eat it in bed. Sounds so good. - But? - I can't. You can't or you won't? Bern, I gotta go now. Where? Where you gotta... Bern. Stop. You still wanna do this? I just don't even... What are you doing? I'm asking you. Yeah. So stay. I want you to stay. And I'm telling you that I cannot. Okay? - Kiss me goodbye. - No. Howdy, ma'am. Anybody helping you? I'm staying in room 129. I booked it this morning. Alright. I hope everything's going okay. Yeah. There seems to be some sort of fight next door. 128. - A fight? - I heard screaming. Alright. You stay dry, okay? Take care, and sorry for the inconvenience. - Get off of me! - Get away from me. Get off me! - Shut up! - No! You again. What's the fucking problem now? I think you know what the problem is. Stop it! Stop it! Stop! What the... what the fuck are you doing? Stop it! - You fucker? What are you gonna do now? - What the fuck are you doing? You son of a bitch, I fucking told you! Don't knock on the door! Fuck you! Follow her. Fuck. Listen, open the door. Open this door, listen! Just fucking open the door. Okay? Come on, fuck! Open this fucking door! Open this fucking door! Fucking hell! - Sir, you can't park here. - What the hell's going on? Bern? Come here. Come here. I got you. Hey. - I thought you were still at the hospital. - Yeah, I was. I'm going to get over to Bern's, get the place fixed up before they cut her loose. - You've gotta go to school today, Mags. - No, I don't mind. Let me help. Don't let this craziness get in the way of what you've gotta do. Alright? Go on, get your stuff. I'll give you a ride on the way in. - How is she? - She's getting there. When is she coming back home? Soon enough. I heard she killed one of them, Sam. Is that true? Yeah. Who was it? Was just some kid. And the other one just got away? He's still out there? Yeah, but he's cut up bad. Police know what to look for. They're gonna search the hospitals. He ain't gonna get far. It's gonna be okay. Are you okay? Yeah. I am. Things like this, Mags, you've just... just gotta let 'em pass through, wait it out. Now get your stuff. I'll get the car. Hey, pal. - Hey, Sam. - Seen your light on. Was wondering if you were up this early. - Yeah, it's early. - Leaving us? - Yeah, going home. - Going back South? Yeah. Well, it's been nice having you. I'll just go ahead and get the rest of your stuff for you. No, no, I'm alright. I don't need help. You're bleeding. Yep. I got into a little accident yesterday, a little car accident, but I'm okay. You had an accident? Yep. What are you doing? Sam. - Hey, Sam. - Piece of shit. Sam! - Sam! - Hey, get back in the room! - Get back! - Sam! Put that gun down. I'm leaving, Sam. Okay? You just... you put it down. That thing still shoot? Put the gun down, I'm not gonna say it again, I will shoot you dead. That's it. I'm out of your hair, okay? I'm gonna call this square, Sam, between me and you. - You just... - But I've got to go. Just walk away from the car, alright? Just walk away... - I didn't mean to shoot that man. - Sam, let him go. Hey, you go back in the office! Go back now! You should listen to her. Okay? I'm not letting you leave. You just walk away from the car. No, no, no. No, no, no. - Walk away. - I can't. - I can't. I'm sorry. - You just... - ...stop. - I can't. Hey, stop. Stop. Please rate this subtitle at %url% Help other users to choose the best subtitles
