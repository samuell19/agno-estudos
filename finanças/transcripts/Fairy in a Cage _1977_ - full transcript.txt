Excuse me for now. How's the investigation of that student Shimojima going? Thanks to you... I placed my men at all possible locations where he may show up. We'll arrest him in no time. That's good. But then we must release that woman Namiji. Well, that's more likely so. She's too good to let go. We'll find someone else to interrogate before then. How about that one? That's the second wife of Sennosuke Kikushima... ...a famous jeweler in Ginza. She's 20 years younger than him. She's more like a daughter than a wife, they say. You know so well. I see her in women's magazines a lot. You're quite knowledgeable for a military man. - Please have a picture taken. - Is it all right? Then let's do it together. What can you do for me? Even though it's your request, I don't see it happening. Even with the power of the military police? Unless she's a criminal... - Mrs. Kikushima. - Hello. You're blushing like a teenaged boy. That's silly! Merchant-class scumbag. Cheers. FAIRY IN A CAGE Producer: Yoshihiro Yuhki Original Story: Oniroku Dan Screenplay: Seiji Matsuoka...

As of April 26, 1941... I've been assigned to the Eastern Military Police Hongo Squad. I'll be reporting to you from now on. Good work. Do you know how to use them? Yes. I learned how at military police school. As you already know... ...these were all given by the emperor himself. Take great care of them and contribute to our country. Yes, sir. Taoka, we don't get our salary for simply being military policemen. Our duty is to protect our country by following strict military rules. I understand. I would sacrifice my own life for my country. Good. Actually, there's something that I want to show you. - Come with me. - Yes, sir. Hey! Are you still going to resist? Get up! Be ready! Can't a deserter like you read the military imperial instructions? One, a soldier shall be loyal no matter what. One, a soldier shall respect... Hey, look me in the eye! One, a soldier shall sever his desires. Say it louder! - How is it? - Yes. - Right here. - Yes. You idiot! Don't keep looking down! Shimojima, you'll feel much better once you confess! Shimojima, say it! Say something! How's it going? Did he confess anything? No. He's a tough one to crack. I thought so. He's not an easy one. Down with capitalism! Down with the emperor! Touto Popular Front... Where did you get the money to print these flyers? - It was Namiji, right? - No. What do you mean "no"? Namiji has confessed already. No way. She's got nothing to do with it. How can you be so sure? On March 24th, you went to a cafe in Shinbashi, didn't you? Yes, but I didn't go there to see Namiji. I couldn't get in because there was a fan club gathering... ...for a kabuki actor, Sennosuke Inoue, organized by someone named Kikushima. What? By Mrs. Kikushima? You mean Kimiko Kikushima, wife of jeweler Sennosuke Kikushima? Yes. The manager of the cafe told me so. Please look into it. Namiji is innocent. Let me take over for a second. I want to ask him a few questions. How's our new catch this time? She's quite stubborn. Is she still chained to the house? Yeah, she's in a cell, naked. She's too good to release afterjust one day. I'm still looking forward to tomorrow. I don't want you to be obsessed with some criminal's whore. I'm doing this for the country. He's a national criminal. Are you jealous? Please tie me up really hard. I feel so naughty today. Okay, I got it. What do you want me to do? Don't be modest. Come on. How do you want me to give it to you? Give it to me like I'm a whore. Good. Stand up. Hold it tighter. That whore's pussy was much tighter than this. I'm jealous. Come on now. Do you want me to go back to that whore? No, I don't want you to go back to her. Oh, it's you. Didn't I tell you not to call me here so many times? What? Is it true? I understand. Then go ahead. Right away. Yes. KIKUSHIMA Who are you? You are under arrest for breaking the national security law. What are you doing? You're coming to the military police headquarters. Go inside. Maron Murayama. Mrs. Kikushima. I never thought I'd see you like this. This must be a mistake. Why am I being treated like this? Well, I can't answer that. I've only been asked to help with the interrogation. Interrogation? I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but you're under suspicion... ...of handing over money to an anti-war student activist. Anti-war? Me? Who said such a thing? This man. Sennosuke. Sennosuke Inoue, a young kabuki actor that you support. The money you handed him went straight to an anti-war student activist. That's a lie, missus. I don't know anything about this. Shut up! We have all the evidence. This is... This is your class photo from elementary school. Look at this carefully. This is you. And this is Shimojima right here. I don't know. I mean, I know Shimojima. But I haven't seen him since elementary school. It's true. Are you saying the military police are wrong? Sennosuke. That's my... That's right. It's your passbook. When did you... It looks like you spent a great deal of money. Some of the transaction dates and amounts match... ...the exact dates and amounts Shimojima paid to the printer of those flyers. That's total nonsense. She seems quite confident despite the fact that she's lying. She must be hiding something. Please go on with the interrogation. Mrs. Kikushima, I don't want to do these kinds of things. Unfortunately, this is my job. Please come this way. What are you going to do? What do you think, Mrs. Kikushima? Do you like this room? Maron Murayama, you're punishing the innocents in this room... ...using interrogation as your excuse. I'll decide if you're innocent or not. Please take off your kimono. What? I'd like you to be naked. Taking a woman's clothes off... Don't you feel ashamed of yourself? This is a normal procedure when we interrogate women. Women have a secret hiding spot. You may be hiding something in there. - Taoka. - Yes. - Take off her obi. - Yes. What are you doing? Don't you know how to take it off? I don't know, sir. Please wait. I'll do it myself. I don't need your dirty hands. Take that thing off, too. Please take that off, as well. Why? Isn't it too much, even if it's your duty? If you refuse, we'll just force you to do it. Please don't do it, missus. You watch it, too! I refuse. You miserable shit! You dance around the stage, pretending to be a woman. You make me sick! This country could be destroyed because of someone like you. I'll teach you a lesson. Mrs. Kikushima, because you aren't honest, this man will suffer. Please take that thing off of your waist. Please stop it already. Why are you doing this? How is it? There's nothing in there. This is terrible. Too much. I've told you many times already. I've got nothing to do with this. There's no way that the missus has got anything to do with Shimojima. Please believe me. I don't care about that. How about you and this woman? She's just a fan of mine. That's not it, is it? Something else must be going on. No way. I wouldn't do anything immoral. Then you're saying there was no relationship between you two? I didn't say that I don't have the right to love someone. Hey, say it again. You fell in love with someone else's wife. You think that's okay? You did it with her, didn't you? Please stop. Missus, please don't look at me like this. For someone who plays a woman, you've got a big one, don't you? You piss me off. How long are you going to hold me here? Unfortunately, I can't let you go just yet. I won't let someone who could be a national threat go so easily. What else do you want to find out? The military police must complete a series of investigations. Maron Murayama, since when do you act as their puppet? What? I'm sorry, but you two must spend the night in here. In separate cells. How do you feel? It suits you. See you in the morning. We're treated worse than cats and dogs. Missus, I'm so upset. As I thought, she's definitely a woman worth torturing. That's why we asked for your help. Please take care of the interrogation, as well. By the way, you've got an impressive collection of tools. Some people may call me a pervert... ...but this is considered to be a noble hobby. In Roman times, the nobles watched the Christians get eaten by lions. The nobles started this type of hobby. - I see. - Oh, before I forget... Here's something to cover the cost. No, we'll take care of the cost of the investigation. Money will always come in handy someday. This is just a donation from me. Thank you so much. And this is for you, too. But I'm just a... Don't be modest. It's his request for you to take it. But... Take it. Go have fun with some women. You couldn't even undo her obi. You must learn how to treat women if you want to work for him. Yes, sir. - Taoka, are you there? - Yes, sir. We're heading to town. They want to throw you a welcoming party. They're saying that they'd like to give you a welcoming gift. I'm sorry, but I've got quite a few things to do. - Sending money home? - Yes, sir. Well, that's fine. You don't drink, you don't smoke. You can't be a good officer. I'm so sorry, sir. Kayo, this is your favorite actor, Sennosuke Inoue. This is like a dream, seeing him so close like this. Well, let's start today's interrogations. Why must we be tortured like this? Just like the climax of a kabuki play. Well, I'll leave him to you for a while. I don't want them collaborating their lies by eavesdropping. Here. That's fine. Right there is fine. It's better not to fight it, Mrs. Kikushima. Is this your way of interrogation? Pleasure works better on women than pain. Please don't! You thought I would stop just because you asked? Tell the truth if you want me to stop! What do you think your husband would think if he saw you now? My husband? I'm sure he will lament this. Please let me see him. At least let me call him. You can't do that. Because your husband is in jail right now. Why? Because of you, Mrs. Kikushima. Because of this investigation, they found out about... ...your husband's illegal trading of luxury materials. Please don't do it. Please stop. Why? Are you claiming celibacy to someone? Is it Mrs. Kikushima? No way. I have nothing to do with Mrs. Kikushima. Then what are you refusing for? I just want to be onstage. You're so cute. Don't you know I'm on your side? So do as I say. If you didn't become the president of my fan club, this wouldn't have happened. I promise you that I'll escape from here. - See you. - Yes. What the hell are you doing? You idiot! Look at yourself! No. You are always into details. Thank you. Hey, it should be red with meat, remember? When I was studying at Eton College... ...there was a guy who knew everything about wine. I learned a lot from him. What do you think? It's very nice. Hurry, missus, let's go. Now's our only chance to escape. What's the matter? Hurry. Sir, they ran away. Wait. There's no need to panic. Hurry. Mrs. Kikushima, why are you trying to escape? Are you going to elope together or something? It's nothing like that! That's for us to decide. Kayo, bring me that medication that causes itching. Please forgive me. Don't move. Please, I'm begging you. Itchy. Very itchy. Itchy. Itchy. Missus, I'm itchy. Hey, you're committing adultery. I guess we were right about these two. Your perfume is very strong today. Wear the imported one that I got for you. That's right. That's the best. What? Don't rush. You're just the wife of an officer. You'd better behave yourself. Spread your legs. That's right. Your legs. More. Move your hips. Come on, get in the mood. That's right. Yes. Please hold on for a moment. Mr. Nishizaki, there's a phone call for you. Well... This is Nishizaki. What? Transfer? I understand. What is it? Because of the current situation, we're being transferred overseas. Wait a minute. Then what about those two? Release them right away. Release them? That's not good. Then what are you going to do? No way. If headquarters finds out about this, you'll be in big trouble. What are you talking about? What do you want me to do? Come on. You're the one who started all this. I understand. What are you doing? What? Lance Corporal Taoka killed Lieutenant Nishizaki? On the run? I got it. Stop! That's the car! - Damn it. - Yes. - Take two men up the hill. - Yes, sir. - Come with me. - Yes, sir. We didn't see them down the river. Okay. Now search the upper river one more time. Yes, sir. Let's go. No. Sir, I found Taoka. - Is that true? - Yes, sir. - Get ready. - Yes, sir. Sir. They must be nearby. Take care of them right away. The evil must be eliminated. Taoka. Don't move. Taoka. Damn you. Lance Corporal Keita Taoka. What a despicable and shameful act. Maggot. Die. Aim! Fire! THE END
