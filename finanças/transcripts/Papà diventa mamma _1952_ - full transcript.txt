Dad Becomes Mom Look at the fineness of these colors. Please, come inside. - The colors change in the daylight. - I beg your pardon, Ma'am? The colors change in the daylight. Well, I'm afraid this shop doesn't have the fabric you're looking for. We have messed up everything. - The one I saw before is better. - When? She means the fabric she saw before. - Don't you remember? We messed up my shop for you. - The blue one. - This one? - Yes, yes! Is this OK? How many meters do you want? - Few... centi... meters. - 100 meters? I'm sorry, we don't have 100 meters. This is 30 meters. What do I need 30 meters for? I want 10 centimeters. You want 10 centimeters. - All together. Is that so? - Yes, a patch. To make an eye patch or something? I'll send a sample to my sister in New York. If she likes it, she will write to me and I'll send her three meters. - I'm sorry. - For heaven's sake, don't worry. Are you gonna take it or shall we send it to you? - I'll take it. - Can you make it? Better, she might need a van. Ambrogio, please, let's not compromise the relations between Italy and USA. - That way, please. - Mr. Peppe. - What is it? Cavaliere, this young lady can't decide between these two fabrics. Can't she? I understand, they're both beautiful. I like this one, but I think one friend of mine has the same. - It's impossible, this a modern fabric. - Yes, nice, but... - Maybe the pattern is similar? - Yes. - Then take this one. - Yes, it's not bad. - Do you like it? - Yes. It would be ideal for a nice flared coat. What do you think? You should talk to your dressmaker. You know, we're men and... Well, that's not true. There are some men who... Oh yeah? But we're a different kind. - Mr. Peppe. - What is it? Take this one, young lady. You won't regret it. - Really? - Yes. This lady is 50 lire short and she doesn't want to use large bills... Yes, money just changed flies away. If you don't mind, I'll be back tomorrow. - Do you trust me? - Yes, I do. After all, USA trusted to lend billions to Italy, so it would be awful if I didn't trust you. Don't worry. - Thanks a lot. You're so kind. - Good day. You didn't deliver the package? I couldn't. On the main door there was a sign that said "no bikes". I couldn't leave mine outside, they'd have stolen it. But that lady is waiting her package. Go and take the bus. If they didn't let me in by bicycle, they won't let me in by bus. Don't try to be funny. Take the bus. Go! - Gimme the money, Dad. - Is this your son? - He doesn't look like you. - That's sure. Come on, go! Hello? Yes. - It's your wife. - What does this nuisance want now? Excuse me, sir, would you mind keep that fabric for me? I'm waiting for my sister to answer me. Don't worry, until your sister answers you, we keep the store closed. - Thank you. - Not at all. Hello, Margherita. So I'm a nuisance? I heard you! Do I bother you? No, you misunderstood. You're always close to the cashier. You shameless! I have proof now! But listen, Margherita... Have you gone mad? I'm mad? I know you want to lock me up in a loony bin, so you can flirt with that chippie! But... what...? Shut up, let me talk! I'll tell you what's going on. It's not true that you need a young and pretty cashier, because at the Berardi's store there is his mother-in-law! She's neither young nor pretty and his business is better than yours! You have always bills under protest, you dirty impudent man! And you're still chasing girls. But now it's over! - Good morning, ladies. - Good morning. I'll be right there. - Move that bike or no one can get in. - OK. Did you understand that I am ashamed? Because I didn't want that cashier. Do "uh... ah". - To whom? - My wife. - Your wife? - Don't ask. Do "uh... ah". Not to me, on the phone. Ambrogio, come here. Get off the phone. - Excuse me. - Tidy up the fabrics. Good morning. - Excuse me. - Don't worry. - Well? - What's the price? - Will you excuse me again? - OK. Margherita, listen... Hello? Well, she's gone. Hello? Good morning, Mr. Varesi. - Are you leaving? - We'll come back another time. - Tomorrow. Look, I was going to call you. When do my two bills expire? Please, do me courtesy of renewing one. Business isn't great. We haven't sold much this month. OK, I'm going to pay one, but... do me this favor. OK, I'll wait for your call. I had to pay the salary to my clerks and... Thanks a lot. Are you tired, Mr. Peppe? It's not a matter of tiredness, but some phone calls... You work too much. You never take your mind off it. Your life is work and home. Where can I go when there are bills to pay. Why don't you go see a movie? Well... what movie? At the Rivoli there's a great movie. - Yes? What's the title? - Meet me Tonight. - How can I? I can't. - No, that's the title. Oh, the title of the movie. - I thought... - No. Because... Excuse me if I misunderstood your "Meet me tonight". Oh yes? Then, If you don't mind, I'll come too tonight. - Listen... - Shut up, you impudent man! I'm not surprised, because I know you're a dirty swine. But you, so pretty and well-dressed, with your engagement ring, aren't you ashamed to flirt with a married man? - Let me speak. - About what? - First, don't break in this way, because you haven't heard what we were saying before. I showed some signs of fatigue and she told me, "Get your mind off things". What about that date? - What? - "Meet me tonight"! Let me finish talking! She said, "Get your mind off things". "What can I do"? "Go see a movie". "At the Rivoli there is a great movie, Meet me Tonight". - You can check it in every newspaper! - Don't fool me! Ma'am, calm down! I only feel respect for your husband. No offense, but I can find a better man. Did you hear? Well, don't exaggerate now. While she was talking to me about movies, which I don't like, I said to myself, tonight I'll take my wife to the theater. After what you put me through, the last thing I want is the theater. OK, we won't go out, we'll stay at home like every night. Of course, a wife who works at home from morning to night, cannot even spend one evening at the theater, but always at home. - Would you lower your voice, please? - Why, does my voice bother you? - Margherita, please, try to be civil. - What do you mean? We're not at home but in a shop. Our employees are watching us. - Why all this? - Now you don't want to look bad? Sorry, gentlemen, if I yelled in my husband's shop. Because I'm his wife! - I know. Everyone in Rome knows it. - If I had married that pharmacist... Don't be late. Come home on time! She never does that at home! Good day. - Excuse me. - Don't worry. Good day. - Hi. - You finally came. The shop closes at 13:00. It's 13.20. The bus can't fly. Well, the bus takes 10 minutes, which means you walked with someone. Margherita, don't start again. Let me eat in peace. You only think about women and eating. Look how he's binging. Speaking of this... I never had the satisfaction of seeing the whole family at the table. I always have to eat alone! Now pretend that you care about family. All you care about is that pasta dish. Look how he's eating, my goodness! - Pecorino? - He just ate and left. - Marcella? - She went to her friend Antonietta to get a book. - Yes, that "Antonietta" has a mustache. - So what? If I catch them together, I'll give him a book. Leave that little girl alone, she must die a spinster? - Let's drop it. - Good. Let's drop it. - Don't you like it? It's not good? - You don't want to eat? What should I eat? You're poisoning my life so much that I can't even eat pasta! Leave me alone, please. I've been working all morning. - I wonder what you have to do. - What I have to do? Mr. Varesi phoned. I wanted to renew my bills. I had already prepared everything but we have to pay them. - See how many worries? - Big deal! - I'd like to see you work at our store. - I wish! So I'd rest a little. You don’t realize what it's like to be a housewife. Shopping, cooking. Today I had to wash a basket of clothes like that and I hung them! By the way, let me see if I have to get them. They are dry. Good morning, Mrs. Lia. What a life, we can never relax. Don't tell me, I didn't even have time for coffee this morning. I do nothing but wash and iron my children's clothes. By the way, do you know that our stupid portress closed the fountain door? - No? - Yes! If anyone’s rude to me, I get rude too. Do you know what she did to me? - The other day... - Margherita! - Wait a minute! - Come here. - See? Everybody wants me. - Excuse me, Ma'am. - When your husband is gone, I have to tell you something. Yes, me too. But... Why are you always gossiping at the window? I just said hello to the lady who looked out. - Well, bye. - Where are you going? - To the store to do the inventory. - Ah-ha, so early? Without "ah-ha". I have to do it. See you tonight at 8:30. Well, it's 8:30 and nobody's here. We never eat together! I always have to eat alone. Always! I want to see when this is going to end. I really want to see. I don't like to eat alone. I don't like! Well? Why are you always yelling? We've already eaten, otherwise we'll be late for the theater. Look how he's binging. Will you let me eat in peace?! - What theater? - You promised us this morning. What do you mean, I promised you? Eat, eat. Look at him. Mamma Mia! - You have to let me eat! - Swallow your food before you speak. I can't if you don't speak keeping time with me! This morning, when I asked you to go to the theater, you said no. Yes, find another excuse. Well, and where can we go, so suddenly? We did choose one. - What did you choose? - We're going to see Bhormah. - Who is Bhormah? - A phenomenon. He makes people sleep. - Don't put the paper on spaghetti! - His spaghetti... - I should eat spaghetti with newspaper ink! - Look. Look at his eyes and how he looks at you. Sure, I'm falling asleep. I know these guys. They have stooges. Tell the truth, you'd like more to go see dancing girls. Come on, hurry up! And look at him, he's losing a button. Hurry up or we'll be late for the theater! Come on, hurry up. And you, turn off the light. This is close properly. You too must turn off the light! - OK. - This kid can barely keep his eyes open. If you had told me about the theater, I'd have bought tickets. - Where's Gnappetta's coat? - In the closet. - My hat? - Here. In the closet... The modern closets your father likes. I knew it. Peppe! Help me open this closet. - Yes, the door sticks every time. - Both. It's in the middle. - Are we taking the tram or the bus? - The bus. We're the first. Come on. - Marcella, come on! - May I? - How many tickets? - One, two, three... four. My child doesn't pay because he's under 1m in height. - Move on! - One moment, don't cause trouble! How can I move on if I can't get tickets? Ma'am, don't push! Listen, you go and sit down. Here, save me a seat. Put my hat on it. Hurry up. And where do I sit now? Come on, move over. That seat is for your father and this is for me. This kid is already asleep. Theater? He should have stayed in bed. There you go. Let's hope we can have fun tonight. - What's in your head? - Why, is it so hard to have fun? - I mean, on your head! - What is? - Where's my hat? - You're sitting on it. - Why didn't you tell me? - Women make you lose your mind. What women?! I was getting tickets. Ladies and gentlemens, good evenings. I have the honor to present for the first time in Italy my sensational experiments which have achieved a great success all over the world. - Have you already been hypnotized? - By what? By those odalisques. I'll start my show with an experiment of collective suggestions. No trickies... of any kindses, because I'll choose in the audience the most suitable people. And now, gentlemens, please be so kinds to put your hands on your head. Interlace your fingers. This way! Very good. Maestro, pleases. Hold them tight. Hold them tight! And now look at me. Your eyeses on me! Your eyeses on me! Very good. And now try to unlock your hands. This way! All right. I ask the gentlemens with their hands still stuck to get on this stage. I will untie them. Don't be afraid. Very good. Please, come here. - Mom, I'm going. - Of course. - Is he crazy? Where's he going? - Should he stay like this forever? Come on, go. But... Excuse me... - My finger! - Leave him alone. What a boy. His face wasn't enough, even his hands get entwined. Come here, gentlemens. Be careful on the stairs. Be strong and braves. Very good. And now gentlemens, I thank you and I ask you to line up over here. Pay a bit attentions, gentlemens. - Can't you unlock them? - No. Sit down over there. Come on, Mister, this is no joke. Please, go over there. Go keep your friend company. Can't you unlock them? Over there. - You... can't unlock them? - No. Can't you? You have ugly face. Beat it. And now, gentlemens, pay some attentions. - Mister, come forward. - Me? Yes, the long one. - You don't look like an athlete. - Sure. - Do you play any sports? - No. - Boxing? - No. - Soccer? - No. Well, when the music plays, you'll feel like Sugar Robinson and Silvio Piola. Understand? Pleases, Maestro. Your eyeses on me. And now her, many thankses. - What job does he do? - Radio speaker. So you should speak very clearly. - Without bragging, yes. - How do you start your broadcastses? With the usual phrase: Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. - We're broadcasting from... - Very good. Pleases, Maestro. Your eyeses on me! Will you say again that phrases? - Say it! - Ladies...and gentlemen...good evening. - One moments. - Tell me. - Would you join them? - Immediately. And now you, Mister. Don't be afraid. Look at my eyeses. Erase all your thoughts. Are you a very sad person? Extremely sad? Very good. Please. Your eyeses on me! Go laugh a little further. I'm happy. I can't hold my hands like this anymore. So what are you doing up here? - Come forward. - Here I am. - Can't you unlock them? - Yes, but if you need a stooge... Many thankses. Come here, Mister. - Is he talking to me? - Mister, come on the stage. No, thanks. I... Why? Are you afraid to talk, so I'll find out something? Margherita, are you kidding? Have no fear. I haven't, but I came here to be in the audience and not on the stage... Excuse me, gentlemen. You're afraid of making a fool of yourself in front of some woman here. - Oh, my goodness! - Come on, please. I won't come. I'm not afraid, but I won't come there, Mr. Maharaja. - I won't come because... - Call him, please. Please, sir. - Come on, my husband went too. - But your husband is young. I'm a grown man... Well, if you're a man, come here. - Come on. - Be brave. He's been calling you for two hours. Hurry up. Pleases. I'll go there alone, because I'm not afraid. But you won't be able to make me sleep, because I'm not a baby. We'll see. Climbs up. - What's he gonna do to Dad? - Nothing. Shut up. You didn't want to come up on stage. No, because I came here to see your show. Good. You're a serious and authoritative man. Excuse me. - It hurts? - No, it's annoying. Very good. When music plays, you... No, first tell me what you'll make me do, because I'm a serious man, I'm a father of a family. I can't tell you, otherwise I'll ruin my effectses on the audience. And I can't do it, otherwise I'll ruin my "effectses" on my family. Good. Then I'll tell just you. Who else can you tell? You said you're a father of a family, didn't you? I'll turn you into a mother of a family. Your eyeses on me! - You stepped on my foot. - Not importance. He wants to gouge out Dad's eyes? Look at my finger. Don't lower your eyeses. Don't move your noses. Don't look at your family. Again. Like this. Don't scratch your head. - Are you done? - Not yet. You can move around me until morning, but I won't sleep. Won't you? Now we'll see. - Your eyeses on me! - Is he crazy for Dad? - No, my son! Your eyeses on me! Your eyeses on me! What happened, for God's sake? - Peppe! - Dad! - Peppe? - Feel better? - Margherita. - How are you? - How do you feel? - My God, what fear. - I feel weird. When... I don't know, I feel... like a void, a sense of lightness. - Why did you go on stage? - I don't know. But you shouldn't have gone there! - God, who undid my button? - I did... - Guard up! ...to get you some air. Calm down! And you too. Calm down. Well, Commendatore? I can't get in touch with that hospital. I'll try it. - So my husband can't go to work tomorrow. - Why? - They'll kill him if he goes. - Why? - He works at the tax agency counter, do you understand? - No, I don't. Excuse me, my dear, why are you saying that I stutter? Do you hear him? He's a radio speaker! - Can't you tell? - He looks more like a listener. But let's all calm down. But tomorrow he's broadcasting the radio news! I understand, but this is a disgrace for everybody. We had to refund the tickets. And you, try to speak well. I... am... trying... but... But that's not possible! If he laughs like that tomorrow, those who have to pay taxes will kill him! - They'll kill you! - But I'm happy. I'll sue all of you! - Calm down, maybe it's not that bad. - Why, calm down! Upsy-daisy! Hands down! Corner kick! If you feel good, let's go. Why stay here? I was watching that young man playing soccer. - Come on, let's go. - If it was up to me... Mr. Director, we'll say goodbye to you. Let me tell you, if that hypnotist fell, it wasn't my fault. And besides, I thought they were his stooges. Stooges?! He really put them asleep, that's the trouble. What if he dies in the hospital?! - No! - I'm happy, yes! - He didn't want to put me to sleep! - It's bad manners to wear a hat! - Excuse me, that's the youth of today. - Don't worry. - Goodbye, Director. - Goodnight. - Best wishes, Ma'am. - Goodnight! - Well?! My God, how ugly is that man! Guard up! Shot saved! But, do you want to pass first? Uh, how ugly he is! Excuse me, I have to... MEN I was almost wrong. LADIES - Someone is in there. - Then come away. Margherita, you know, something is happening to me, - I feel a sense of lightness. I don't understand... - Again? Who knows... There's never a free seat... on the bus. It's very convenient to read a newspaper on the bus, so you can't notice who is nearby... standing up... swinging from side to side. - Are you talking to me? - I don't know. - And he's looking at me as well. - You're the one who's looking at me! - Of course. - So what? So what? You should understand why. You see, this is 1952. Once there was more sense of duty, of chivalry! Get it? Oh, you finally got it! Look at her, with the baby, the purse. At least give me your purse. Finally! Understand? - What's wrong? - Nothing. No wonder. When I woke up from that faint, I felt a sense of lightness, of... I don't know, a strange feeling. - My nightgown? Marcella. - Yes. Where is it? - Marcella! - What is it? - Have you seen my nightie? - It was here. It's not here. I've looked everywhere. I can't find it. - What are you doing, Dad? - Are you joking? - Why are you laughing? - Giancarlo, come see Dad! And that stupid girl's calling Giancarlo. - But you're wearing my nightgown. - Yes. - And what I'm gonna wear? - My pajamas. - What joke is that? - I'm not joking. I can't sleep with my pajamas, because I wrap myself in bed. I'm more comfortable with a nightgown, I can move freely. - Are you serious? - Yes, do you think I'm joking? Then you've become an idiot! Listen, don't start humiliating me or I'll get angry. Come on, get in bed and let's not argue. You're sleeping on my side of the bed too? - I can't sleep close to the door. - Why not? So if a thief comes in with a knife, he'll kill me. Did you hit your head, when you passed out? Do me a favor, put on your pajamas and come straight to bed. - It's late, come on. - My God. The last button is going to fall. I'll sew it in the morning. Gnappetta, look at Daddy. Hey kids, what's so funny? Will you go to bed? And stay warm. Come on, go to sleep. Your father wants to joke tonight. I wonder what happened to him. - Give me my magazine and get yours. - No, no! - They don't interest me. - But I don't understand politics! And neither do I. Listen, the fashion trends of this year... I know you only watch models. My God, I only watch models? - Gimme that little box? - Which one? - That one. I was talking about the sweaters with ribbed texture. - I like them with pockets. - Damn it! - What are you doing? - Can I use some? - Do you also put cream on? - Should I go out with my skin chapped?! - I can't have smooth skin? - Give it to me. You'll buy yourself another box. I'll keep this. When will you stop this? Give me that box. No! I also have the right to have my things. Stop trying to be funny! You don't make me laugh at all! - I'm being funny? - Yes. - I don't get you tonight. - I don't get you either. - You're being so weird. - Knock it off! It's time to stop. You have to knock it off. - Goodnight, Margherita. Give me a kiss. - Are you still joking? Well, if you don't want to... it doesn't matter. - Goodnight. - Bye. But the stake behind the door... - I put it. Who should enter? - Are you sure? If the one with the knife comes in, he'll stab you first. - Will you make me sleep? - Sleep. I think I hear something. - Can you hear it? - No. Be quiet a second. There's a little noise. - What is it?! - My God! - Mamma Mia! - What is it? - A rat! - Where?! - Over there. Be quiet, it's better you don't look at him. Margherita. Your coffee. - This is something new. - Why? Since we got married, - you brought it to me the morning after wedding... - And this morning. - I woke up earlier. - Are you wearing my robe? Yes, you know... my robe has a dull color that I don't like anymore. Don't you think these colors make me look thinner? You can't talk like that at your age. Why? After all I'm 42 years old. - Yes... 45! - By the way... Almost 45, but my real age is 44 and 5 months, because I was born in November. - My God. - And let me say, if I fix myself up, I'm still attractive to some. - You really want to joke. - Let's not waste time. Here are the keys and go to our store. - Me? - Yes, it's time to open it. - Should I go there? - Who else? Me? - Of course, you have to go there. - That's funny, me going to the store. What are you saying?! Look, you've been joking since last night. I'm taking you seriously and I'll really go to there, so I won't do anything all day, like you always do. But here you have to do what I always do, all right? Obviously! You're strange, I don't understand you. - So we can see if this thing ends. - Hurry up, get dressed. Let me out of here. Look, this vase is without water. It's full of dust. We need to wax the floor. - Mom, my coffee with milk. - I'm coming, my son. Don't eat bread and tie your napkin. Ah, if I weren't here, nobody would do anything. Since one gets up in the morning... Ah, what a life I have to live. Good. As soon as one turns, the milk... bloop... comes out. I'm really going to the store. What are you waiting for? Just leave me money for groceries. Of course, I'll give you back the money you gave me for this week. That's enough till Sunday, so you'll know what it’s like to work at home. Don't start being stingy. Things are expensive nowadays. - Even our usual pasta? - We won't eat it anymore. - Why? - Pasta makes you fat. We'll eat meat and vegetables. You've found a great excuse to stay at home and do nothing. - You're not coming to the store? - No, this poor boy must have breakfast. Then he has to go shopping, because today I don't want to. I'm right to say that you don't want to work. Come on, sit down. Don't listen to your mother. - Milk or coffee? - Coffee. Coffee. Here it is. They think they do all the work. The sugar is here. - Don't you see? - What? - A loose button. - Take off your jacket and I’ll sew it. - Who? - Me. - You? - Yes. Why? Do you have to graduate to sew a button? Give me your jacket. Look at him, his shoes are dirty. Bring me the sewing box. Ah, what horrible things to see. Come on, have your coffee. And you, eat. Did you put sugar in? Here, take this. And then you go shopping. Here is 1000 lire. What do I have to buy? Buy me a half kilo of veal slices... fresh and tender. Then, two kilos of fruit. 100 grams of ham. A stick of butter, a bottle of oil, some bread and lots of vegetables. - With 1000 lire? - What do you want, a million?! - I only buy vegetables with 1000 lire. - Are you pocketing the change? Here, another 500 lire and then write on a note the money you spent. At 13:15 I want everything ready on table. I close the store at 13 and at 13:15 I'll be here. Because I have no one to walk with! Your mother is so whiny. She's very whiny. If I had married that pedicurist... Before I met your mother, I was with a pedicurist... - She could've given me injections too. - In your calluses? What calluses? My little feet are white and smooth like a baby's. When I was in the Artillery Corps they called me "fairy feet". Damn it, if I can't put the thimble on, I can't... See, I also dropped my thimble. Mom, I'm going to take this book to Antonietta, so... Tell me, dear. What's wrong? - Are you sewing? - Yes, and I threaded the needle without my glasses. - And Mommy? - She went to the store to work. - Why? - Don't ask questions and sit down. I'm going to return this to Antonietta, so she'll give me another one. Yes, but sit down first. We need to talk for a minute. Don't stare at me. Now it won't come off again. Look, go for groceries immediately. And take him in the other room. Go play with the airplane. - Well, what's the name? - Of the book? - No, him. - But Dad... You can talk to me. There must be no secrets between us. But you've always been against it. I know, but tell me his name. He's a very serious boy and loves me so much. My dear, you can't trust men. They're all the same. They make a lot of promises and say many things, but... you have to be careful. But he's different. His name is Luigi. So he's different because his name is Luigi? Tell me one thing... - Does he have blond or brown hair? - Brown. I'm glad. This contrasts with your hair. Look, I have to meet him. If he's really a nice guy, I'll introduce him to your mom. I'll talk to her and I'll put in a word for him, then you can get engaged officially. OK? - Thanks, Dad! - My dear. - But be careful. - Don't worry. - Bye, Dad. - Bye, baby dear. My goodness! I forgot to tell him to buy tripe for you. Damn it. - Marcella! - What do you want? Buy some tripe for the cat. - Some beef lung. - Yes, bye. Make it quick. Poor cat, without his tripe. Good morning, Mrs. Lia. Good day. I mistook you for your wife. No, my wife went to the store. It's almost 9:00 and I still don't know what to cook. I sent my son to buy some vegetables and meat, but I don't know what soup to cook. This cat is scratching me! Go to hell! He has some sharp claws! I'm cooking risotto. My husband really likes it. I'm undecided because it's my first time cooking for her. You know, everyone has his tastes and it's difficult to please wives. Besides, I have to be careful, because I have a liver ache. Sometimes I feel a pain here that turns behind and stops here. So I can only sleep on my stomach. And sleeping this way I look like a rocking horse. If I use one pillow, my head aches. If I use two pillows, I get a stiff neck. I also have arthritis and I can't going up stairs. I'm out of breath and I can't go on, even though I wear low heels. Tell me, Mrs. Lia... yesterday you told my wife you had to tell her something when I'd have gone out... Nothing, our things. Tell me. Is it about the man upstairs? Or is it about that woman flirting with that guy? Or the daughter of Mrs. Lalla? No, our things. Come on, you can tell me. What I hear goes in one ear and out the other. How much dust in these fabrics. It means you never clean. I should always be here. Uhm. Ah. What "ah"? I said you never clean here. Ambrogio, phone for you. - Me? - Yes, you. - And who is it? - I don't know. It's a strange voice. Who could it be? Here. - Hello? - Ambrogio, is that you? What are you looking at? You moron! You never saw me? Put the pot on the stove. When the water boils, take it to the terrace. I changed my voice so I don't get caught by my wife. Listen carefully, Ambrogio. - Just answer me yes and no. - Yes and no. Listen, you have to do something right now, because my stupid son forgot everything. Buy at the grocery store 100 grams of pork cheek, a can of tomato sauce, and 100 grams of pecorino cheese. - Is it my husband? - Yes... no! - Didn't you understand? - Yes! Eh! You said no. Do it properly or I'll throw you out! No, no, no! Yes, yes. Sorry, Ma'am, but I have to go. - Why? - I feel sick. - And where are you going? - To the grocer. - To the grocer? - I have to buy a can of tomato sauce. - You feel sick and buy tomato sauce? - Yes, it's a new treatment. If I don't bring him the can, he'll throw me out. - Who? - The grocer. - He'll throw you out? - You know how they are. If you don't bring him a can, he'll throw you out. Excuse me, I'll put on my coat and be right back. Well, a can of pecorino a pork cheek of tomato and another... - Is he dumb or drunk? - Don't know, he had never done this. - This is crazy. - Did you see what happened at the Odeon theater yesterday? Yes, we were there. That fakir fell off the stage and broke his head. Serves him right. And those wretches will have to remain hypnotized until he's healed. - What wretches? - The ones who got on stage. Oh my God! - Now I see. It's all your fault. - Mine? This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't talked about movie and theater. - This is the first-born. - Is Daddy at home? - What is he doing? - He went on the terrace to do laundry. To do laundry? ♪... half-mad people ♪ ♪ You must be able to choose the boys ♪ ♪ You must be able to choose... ♪ I was going to fall on this step. ♪ ...the boys ♪ ♪ But every dog won't have his day ♪ - Who is singing? - The man who owns that fabric shop. - I saw him cooking this morning. - Mamma Mia!- What is he doing here? - Hey, gimme some space, please. - But he's crazy? - Now men do laundry too? - I'll wash this and I leave. - For heaven's sake! - Make room for me, ladies! - They don't even help me, just stare at me. - That's all we need. Move over. Give me some space! - Hey, it was your initiative or they sent you here? - Why? - What's your day? Mine is Thursday. - Mine is everyday! When I have dirty clothes I can't wait for my day. Wash. And mind your business. It's better to wash colored clothes with green soap. - But they invented the washing machine. - I don't trust it. - The washer ruins the clothes. - Of course! To wash well it takes hands! Who are we kidding? Who are you? - What is it? - This is my place. - I went where there was room. - But I only stepped out for a minute. Go wash over there. I can't rinse my white clothes in dirty water. - Don't yell! You don't scare me! - And neither do you. Don't bully me! Did you buy this place? Go or I'll put your head in the fountain! I'll put you entirely in the fountain! You wretch! - Let me go or it will end badly. - Who's a wretch?! - Now I'll show her! - Come here, let it go. Hey, Mrs. whatsit, what are you bitching about? Leave me alone because I don't wanna talk! Come on, talk. You can't say anything about me! I keep my head held high, because my children are all my wife's. - And mine are not my husband's? - It's your and your husband's business. Yeah? He'll take care of you when he gets back! And you'll talk to my wife, when she gets back! - I'm not afraid of her! - Don't yell! - Take your hands off! Mamma Mia! I'll rip out those four hairs you have! Take her away or I'll kill her! Go away and leave me alone! Get off me! I'll eat you alive! You moron! Here is my son. Now he'll take care of you! - Come here! - Big deal! You need your son. Your handsome son, with that parrot face! Did you see they've torn my shirt? One of the next mornings I'll throw them all in the fountain! I was also falling. - Here, I've done it. - You bought everything I told you? Yes, the pecorino and the tomato sauce. Now I should... That baby always cries. Pecorino, go home. - I wanna to see what he did. - But I... I wanna know what he did. I can't hear the children cry. - I have to get back... - Please. When I hear children cry I feel something in my heart... I feel sad. Ma'am, why is your baby always crying? As usual, he refuse to drink milk every time. I'll give him the milk. Here, take this basket. Give him to me, Ma'am. For children... it takes some skill. Mama's darling! Darling. Maybe he didn't sleep last night. Or... How beautiful he is. - Do you see how to give milk to babies? But you have to swaddle him and watch over him. You could give him a bath. - You have to watch over the children! - Thanks. Well... It's no use giving me back that basket. Let's go. I got a lot to do. I have to hang out the laundry. Hang out? Get in. - Did anyone realize it was me on the phone? - No one. - Also because I was so spontaneous. - Good, Ambrogio. I couldn't come because I was on the terrace doing the laundry. - Laundry? - Yes. The I had a fight with those four loudmouths. They've torn my shirt. Here is one. You've torn my shirt! Me? But I didn't meddle. - Then I'm a fool?! - I just wanted to break the fight. Be thankful I was alone. You were five against me! - Bye-bye. - Yes, get lost. - Goodbye. - Then I'll fix you good! - All right. Let's go. Don't look at that ugly woman. Hey, he's gone mad! No one can understand it. And I'll fix you too! - Are you angry at me now? - Yes, at the whole building. This is a conspiracy, but you've fallen on the wrong person. Because if I start talking, I'll make you all hide for shame! The cleanest of you has a dirty shirt! Understand? I'm the one who doesn't want to talk. If I do, it will be trouble for you! Come on, you can say what you want. There's nothing against me! Let me tell you. Do you see him? He's my shop assistant. Tell her who I am. This is half idiot. - Let's go. - That's better. And remember, the first one that I'll find in the fountain, I'll put her with her head in it! All right? Come on, let's drop it. And go to hell! Your father is fighting and you don't help him?! - What do I know? - What do you know?! You should've defended your father! Ah, yes, jump! Help this poor old man pull the basket down. - This is heavy. - Come on. - Did you buy everything? - Yes. Tomato sauce, pecorino, pork cheek of good quality? I told him it was for a sick person. OK, take off your coat. Come on, take off your coat. Let me see these... Good. Maybe a little rancid. Take off your coat! Sit down and clean the chicory. - Clean the chicory? - Yes. - Me? - You eat chicory without cleaning it? No, we clean it, but not me. - And who does that? - My wife. But now your wife is not here, who else can do it? You. That's the knife. Cut it into four strips. - Look, put this thing on your head. - But... Ah! Cleaning is necessary in a kitchen! If you find a hair in your food... it's disgusting. And I don't know how my wife would react if she find a hair in the chicory. - You too. - Me? Yes, put this thing on your head! Won't you do something?! Clean those peas, Gnappettina. - I'll prepare a fried onion. What are you looking at? - No... - My God, you're really ugly with... - You too. But I must wear it. That's not the point. But you're funny with that mustache. - Funny? - You make me laugh. Why don't you trim it? Trim your mustache. It looks bad on you. Really bad. Besides, it's superfluous hair. With an ointment... What are you looking at?! You're really ugly. Can you believe he's my son? Why did I do it? - Mrs. Lia? - What? Did you hear what happened to me on the terrace? No, I know nothing of it. Ten women jumped me. If we hadn't been divided, I'd have eaten them alive! - You don't say. - But I'm not to be trifled with. What are you looking at? What do you want? Are you talking to me? That's asking for trouble. Go in there. Let me talk to him! I don't talk to men. They're all ignorant! Talk, talk. Say what you want. I'll make your eyes like this! To me? You think you're scaring me because you see me alone? But I too have a man. Come here. - Look at him. - Who's that dumb face? - He called you dumb face. - Me? But he doesn't know me. Tell him something. But go away, go away! Who's that ugly man? - He's my tenant. - He's so vulgar! Who does he mean? To whom did he say vulgar?! - I'll throw this in his face! - To who? - To you! - Try it, if you have the guts! I have. Take this! He threw it! You rascal! Go to hell! - You dirty beast! - It serves you right! When my wife comes back, she'll give you the rest! To you too! My wife will take care of all of you! It's crazy to hear such things! OK, there's the atomic bomb, but... You ugly skag! Come here! Tell them something! To those tired ugly skags! Don't get me started or... My God, holy God! Will you knock it off?! You ugly skag! Wait a second. - Well? - Good day. - Good day. My robe always falls off. Before throwing the flowers in the garbage, put your arms in the sleeves. Because there are kids watching you, and that's very bad! Understand? Don't come on the stairs dressed like that anymore! Let's go. Throw this flower! Pulling up and down these rolls all day, arms are shattered in the evening. To believe something you must first try it. Poor Peppe. Yes, Ma'am. It takes the strength of Samson and Delilah. - What are you doing?! - Gosh! - Get up, Ma'am! - Are you crazy?! You dropped all those rolls! At least help me get up! Come on, give me a hand. Good morning. Hold this baby, please. Hey, are you playing hide-and-seek? - Are you gone mad? - Am I? - What are you doing here? - Can't you see it? After a man spends all day taking care his child, cooking and doing laundry, he comes here and finds his wife playing hide-and-seek. - I'm astonished that you think... - Only I know what I think. - You shut up! - Let him talk! Are you afraid he'll say something? Shut up and leave married women alone, you old man! "Peppe, Peppe!" The clerks know that I'm your husband! Everyone in Rome knows it. You could've chosen a more handsome man! Ah, If I had married that pedicurist... - Excuse me, sir. - Me? If I had married that pedicurist, I wouldn't have suffered. You scoundrels! This young lady wants to talk to you. - Do you remember me? - I do. - I'd like to know if this is pure wool. - Of course it is. I'd like to make... Oh, I remember. Last time you told me to go to my dressmaker... - What do you need it for? - For a negligee. It's easy. Forget the dressmaker. They always say the same thing. If you want a negligee, - do a flared one. Like this. - Peppe, please. Leave me alone! Fitted at the waist. With two folds and raglan sleeves. A nice classic neckline with two clips... - Oh my God, is it noon? - Yes. Oh, daddy's darling, come here. I still have to clean the peas. If my lady comes and lunch isn't ready, who argues with her? Make haste. And come home on time. You smoocher. At last! Why don't you come straight home as soon as you close the store? Where else should I go but home? If you came straight home, you'd be here sooner, but I... - I don't want to think about it. - Where's Marcella? She went to her friend Antonietta to get a book. Yes, a friend with a mustache. Leave that girl alone! Everyone in life needs a little love. - You're not eating? - No, I had a cup of milk. If you had waited, we coulda had pasta together. If I keep eating spaghetti, who knows where I'll end up. From tomorrow on, I'll start the dissociated diet. - What? - Mrs. Clementina explained it all. To lose 10 kilos in five days. On Mondays only meat, Tuesday only vegetables, Wednesdays only fruit, Thursdays five lemons juice, - a glass of warm water... - Look, I've been working all day. Mr. Varesi also came and he said bills cannot be extended. I got lots of worries and don't wanna hear your nonsense. Yes, only your work is important. What we do is worth nothing. I'm in the kitchen all day. What if I don't cook anymore? - And give me a break today, I'm nervous! - Why? Mrs. Rosa stained my laundry by hanging her colored clothes over it. If she does it again, I'll tear her hair out! - Will you stop it? - Yes, go on, humiliate me. After I bought you these carnations. Instead of saying me, Peppe, thanks for these fl... you humiliate me and say that I talk too much. I can't even talk! It was better if I had married that pedicurist! Hey, now you show up?! Why didn't you come to the store today? - I was busy. - He didn't come to the store? He told me he was going to the store. That scoundrel! He left me home alone with all the work I had to do! When I'm dead, you should make me a monument! - You'll need a lot of marble. - Do you hear? Children have no more respect! And you never say anything to them! When they answer me like that, if you slapped them, they wouldn't dare anymore! Trust me. Go back there, come on. You dirty scoundrels! You'll know when these poor little bones are gone. At this rate, everyone will walk on my belly! Please, knock it off. So I have to knock it off, after everything I did this morning. I didn't even eat, but I let you eat. Eat, eat! Since you can do it. - Peppe. - Leave me alone. - Don't be like that. - Go away, Margherita. - Do you want some coffee? - No, I don't. - Let me take a coffee spoon. - No, don't open this drawer! - I don't want coffee. - Why can't I open this drawer? - You can't. Leave me alone. - Let me see what's inside! - There's nothing, my stuff. - Peppe, let me open it! You'll spoil everything! Stop it, Peppe. Open this drawer! OK, you asked for it! it was a surprise and you spoiled it! I wanted to knit a wool sweater with ribbed texture for you! That's it! I am a wretch! I learned the knit and purl stitches just as the lady upstairs taught me. Gnappetta, go in the other room with Pecorino. Look, Peppe, we'll go to the Doctor tomorrow. Do you feel ill? - No, I don't, but it's you... - I feel fine. - But look at the state you're in. - I have to get better soon. I gotta start wearing a corset, else I'll look a fright. See what you're saying? You're not normal! - I am perfectly normal, my dear. - Can't you see you're a woman?! Well, what's wrong with that? And you're not a woman? Leave me alone and stop humiliating me. I'd kill myself. This lip balm against chapped lips is really a godsend. I use the normal lipstick. Its fat protect me from chapping. I don't, but my wife uses it sometimes. She took me to see this specialist. She says he's good. But I'm not sick. - What is your sickness? - I have nightmares. - I come here every 15 days. - I have fainting spells. It happened to me the other night in a theater. I passed out and when I came to, I felt in my temples... how can I say... a sense of lightness... It was so weird... I'll send him to you right now. Come on. But what are you doing? I was putting on my lip balm for chapped lips. - I was just telling... - Go in there. - Alone? - Don't be afraid. He's not a Doctor. - He's a lawyer? - He's a specialist in nerve diseases. But I'm not nervous. Why do you force me to see him? An examination will do you good. - Damn it! What nerve! - See? - Yes, but it's examination anxiety. - Come on, he's waiting for you. - Come inside, please. - Don't leave me alone. - No, I'm here. - You know... Don't go anywhere. - I'll stay here. - Your hat, please. - Why? - Would you please take it off? - Why? It looks so good on me. - Would you like to sit down? - Yes. - What's your name? - Giuseppino. Giuseppe. - Age? - Why do I have to say that? If you have to visit me... I have this form to fill out. - 50? - 50? Do I look like I'm 50? - Write down 4... - 45. - Occupation? - Househusband. I'll tell you some words now. You'll have to answer immediately with other words related to mine. If I say garden, you could answer tree, flower... but immediately. I understand. And who made a mistake, pays penance. Sit down there. - This is not a game. - No? It's one of the most serious experiments in psychoanalysis. - Sit down here. - Do I have to? - In this way? - Yes. Pay attention. - Sun. - Sun? - Makes you think of? - I have to hang my laundry. It must be dry by tomorrow... - I see. - Do you? - Sea. - Sea... By the way, is this the year of the bikini? Last year in Fiumicino I wore a swimsuit that I could turn into a bikini... - Take off your clothes. - Oh my God, my hat! I can't take my clothes off! Are you ashamed of me? I'm a Doctor! - But this young lady... - OK, I'll go out. Wait, my hat! - She wanted to take my hat. - Take off your jacket and let me hear. - Wait, there's a button! - I have to hear. What are you going to do? What do you have to hear? - Don't breathe! - I'll die if I don't. - Don't breathe. - Yes, but... What is it? - Let's test your reflexes. - Is it that bad? Hold this. Pay attention. - What are you thinking? - But Doctor, are you joking? I'm not joking! This is American psychoanalysis. OK, but I'm Italian. This is a very serious science. Here. Here it is. - Let's try to get rid of this fluid. - What fluid, excuse me? Nothing. Don't think. Do not think... I have to! That hammer? - Just trust me. I'm a Doctor! - Yes, but you're also a man. Men should not be trusted. No offense. Don't look at me, look at these two cones. - Why should I? - Don't look at me! Attention. Attention! Oh my God! Are you crazy?! - What happened? - He hit me on the head with a hammer! What hammer? Can't you see it's rubber? Don't be a child! It's really soft. But I didn't know it. Please, go away. I'm examining him. Otherwise we'll get nowhere. - I'm so sorry. - Margherita! - Peppe, stay calm. - Don't go away! Thanks, Ma'am. You have to trust me or I won't be able to remove the fluid. - Again with this fluid. - Trust me, you don't have to think. Let's try the Fischer-Bauer method. - What's that? I haven't heard of it. - Don't worry. - Please sit there and look. - Why should I have to do this? Do you see this? Do you see this drawing, the circles, the center? - Yes, I'm not blind. - Take four steps back, come forward with your arm stretched out and your eyes shut, and try to hit this center. - Without a gun? - What gun? With your finger! Now I'll show you how. Pay attention. Are you looking at me? - Yes, I am. - I'll close my eyes, I'll extend my arm and I'll go. - See? - You hit the center. - Congratulations, Doctor. - It's your turn now. Come on. - And what happens when... - Don't worry, it's an experiment. Come on, have no fear. You have to trust me. Extend your arm. Not like this. With the fist. No, I mean the finger! - Close your eyes. - What if you scam me again? Come on! Do you think I'm joking?! - Will you do it or not?! - I don't know why! - That's enough. - I would rip off everything! Come on. OK, let's hurry up, because I have a lot of work to do. I have to work and wash. - Very good. Relax. - Let's hurry up, because I'm fed up. - Close your eyes. Extend your arm. Come forward. How ridiculous is American psychoanalysis. What happened?! Margherita, he bit me! - He bit you? - Yes. - He bites. He bit my finger! - I don't bite! I was trying the Fischer-Bauer method and this man dares say I bit him. - You bit my finger. - What do you know about it?! I was doing an experiment to try to shock you, to free you from that fluid. That's what I was doing! And you're saying I bit you! Take him away, Ma'am. I can't waste time. I have other patients. First he hit me with a hammer, then he bit me! - At this rate, I'll take barbiturates! - Go away! But you're the only specialist in Italy. Ma'am, your husband doesn't need a specialist, but a psych nurse. - Stop it. That's enough! - Please, save him! - How can I save him? - We'll end up out in the streets! Stop talking like that! I feel fine! - Peppe, shut up! - I'm offended. Can't you see the condition your wife is in? Shame on you! Be more serious! You're like a kid. - Unbelievable! - Don't leave him. Help him. - I don't understand these methods. - Shut up and have faith. - I'm doing this for you. - Faith in hammering. I'm doing this for you. I'll use the Deutsch-Mayer method. - Let's see... - Be quiet, Peppe. - Do you dream? - Yes. Do you have nightmares? - Yes? - And what do you dream about? - Dogs. - You never told me that. They’re young dogs I've recently met. I never dreamed of them before. What breed of dogs? Small breed: Saint Bernard. - What? They're not small! - Yes, they're this size. - Don't be ridiculous. - OK, show me how tall they are. Those dogs are at least this tall. - See? Now I've tricked him! - How dare you?! You hurt me! - How much money do you owe Varesi? - How should I know? - You work at the store now. - Yes, unfortunately. So you'll know how much work there is. - Yes, there's no work at home, eh? - Everyone has to do their share. These electric irons... Next time I'll use a flat iron, like my mother did. - Are you done? - But you always told me to eat slowly. - Today you have to hurry! - You want me to choke? Be a good boy, go away. I wanna be alone with him. Nobody knows what's going on in this house. - Hurry up. - Go, go. Margherita, why did you want to be alone with me? I didn't! I just wanted to tell you that I phoned that theater manager! We're going to the hospital tomorrow to see that hypnotist. Understood? But he's not a relative of ours! You always talk about him! It's time to stop this! That's enough! It's crazy, all misfortunes always happen to me. I cant' go on like this! You're mean to me since that night we went to the theater. - Oh my goodness! - You see... I sprayed half a bottle of perfume and it's all gone! But do you hear yourself? Aren't you ashamed?! This is so confusing. Keep it up and one day I'll leave home and go back to my mother! Stop it, Peppe! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I said it in a fit of anger. No, I won't go back to my mom. I won't leave you. We have three children, how could I? I'm always the same. Doctorses, come here. Come here, pleases. Come closer. You must save me. What are you saying? You're almost healed. - Look at my eyeses. - Yes, you're still cross-eyed. - But how can it be? - Because of your fall. Damn it, not my eyeses! - They're tools of my trade. - Come on, have courage. - Doctorses. - What is it now? Doctorses, you must save me? - Me? - You shut up! - I'm not talking to you. - But I didn't say a word! You see, Doctorses, what's happening to me? To talk to you I have to look at the radiator. Now, now, you can live well even with cross eyes. Don't you think his squint is caused by a psychic trauma? Maybe a sudden shock could make his eyes normal again. Get some rest now. Listen, Doctorses... I wonder if my magnetic fluid... if I still have my magnetic fluid. - How sad. - Shut up! That's sad, my goodness. You three stay here. Let's go. Could you please tell me if a hypnotist with a beard is a patient here? - Yes, he's here. - Thank you. - Sir, your hat. - What is it? - Take it off. They're all crazy. The want me to take my hat off. Hey, sir, do you remember us, my husband? Maybe... yes. Are you crazy? Don't you remember you called me up on the stage? I think it's your fault if I fell off the stage. My fault?! You hit your head and went crazy! When you did this and then you fell, I got scared and passed out. And when I came to I felt something... I also told Mrs Lalla... a sense of lightness here. - Something strange. - Stop it, you sound like a broken record! Don't humiliate me, or I'm leaving. Look, you must turn my husband back to normal. What's wrong with him? He's very sick, like those other three wretches. Since that night, I no longer have a husband, I have a wife. - What did you do to him? - Go away! - You have to turn him back into a man. - What do you want? - Nothing. - Then go away! - See? - He was meddling in our business... - Can't you see I'm right? - Why? What is it? - Shut up! He must come back a man. Got it? Well, I'll try. - Come forward, you. - Me? Not you. Go away! Oh, my poor child! Are you hurting my son? Are you crazy? Did you see how he grabbed him?! - I'm talking to you. - But why me? - I'm not talking to you, but to him. - But you're looking at me. No, Ma'am, I'm looking at the radiator. Why the radiator? When I look at the radiator, I see you. Come on, let's start, hurry up. Your eyeses on me! - Who? - You. You're being informal?! You're so impolite! Oh, I'm starting to look grim too! Your eyeses on me! Now I remember. That night he was doing this... Silence! You'll become a man. You'll feel masculine. I order you! You're... a man! You're a man! You're a man. - You are... - Are you done? Boy, he's so boring. He's supposed to do one thing and then he started crying. - My God, what have I done?! - What is he doing? What does he want? He's a weird guy. - Hey, you're not going to smoke that cigar, are you? - Why can't I? Because it makes me nauseous and I can't stand its smell. Can I have half of it? Thanks. - Do you have a match? - Ma'am, do you smoke cigars? Of course, I'm out of cigarettes. What else could I smoke? - I didn't know you had this vice. - Shut up, I do what I want! I'm sorry. - Let's ask this patient. - Yes, yes. Excuse me, what is the bed of that hypnotist with a beard and mustache? - Who are those? - Those who were on stage that night. Let's go see. Oh, you're all here. I remember you. You were at the theater that night. - This your Dad. - Yes, he is. He looks like you. How are you? - May I, Ma'am? - Yes. - This is my wife. - I'm very glad. Delighted to meet you. Now we're screwed. Excuse me, what sport do you do? Uh, he's asking me what sport I play? Are you crazy? Uh, what happened to that young man? Is he hurt? Why is he gagged? Who did it? I had to do it. Since he was hypnotized, he's become so terrible. - Why, what's wrong? - You see, when he's about to kiss me... What does he do when he's about to kiss you? Ah! Don't do such things. It's terrible. - Sure, if this happens to me... - Hey, the magician is gone! - Dad. - What is it? - That magician ran away. - All right... - Which way did he run? Over there. The hypnotist ran away. I'll take care of it. Leave that magician alone. Come on! He's gone, we go home and it's over. We can't stay all day looking for him. Dad, I'll go find him. You stay here. Hey, I'll do what I want! - Doctorses, Doctorses! - What is it? Why did you let all those people in? They came an hour before visiting hours in the hope that you could heal them. - No, I can't. Crooked eyes, I'm sick. - Then go to bed. - But it's a tragedy. - Go to the Chief Doctor. - I can't help you, I'm sorry. - Doctorses, just one word... Come here, Gnappetta. Stop! - I can't find him. - Let's go! I have to cook dinner. No, we'll have dinner in a tavern. Gnappetta, come here! - The magician! - Go away! Mom, the magician! There he is. He's so ugly! - You ran away, eh? - No, I didn't. Stop and leave me alone. Go away. What? My boyfriend can't stay like this. - Sure, I can't stay like this. - Do you hear the way he talks? - Do you hear him? - Yes, yes. Why are you laughing? Are you stupid? You ruined my son! I'm ruined too because of that fat guy. Never as ugly as you, with that two-bit face! - He's disrespectful. - You wretch, I'll smash your face! To me? I'm not answering you because you're a lady. Me?! You think you're talking to him?! I'll fix you! Get off me! What are you doing, Margherita? Don't get into trouble! You dirty rat, how dare you insult a lady?! I'll smash your head! Don't run away! I'll straighten that pumpkinhead's eyes! I'll teach you to call me "lady". - You thought you were talking to my husband? - Mom! - Leave me alone! - He can't get away. I'll show him! I feel as strong as a lion. I am sick, go away! You'll see how I break your head! - Help me find him! - Mom! - Come on, look for him! - I can't take it anymore. Stop following me! Go there and look for him. I can't find him. Where did he go? I can't see anyone. Peppe, where are you? - I'm here. - I can't see you. - Here, let me move this sheet. - Damn these sheets! God, God, God! - Is it you? - Oh my God! - Did I hurt you? - You killed me! - How could I've known? - There he is! At last! - Now I'll break your head! - No, Ma'am! Get down! Give me a hand. - What are you saying? - Help me! Ah, that's what you meant. - Help me. - Save him! - Mamma Mia! The highway! What a blow! Attention! Dad! My God! - Make a little effort! - Come on, Pecorino. Now my eyeses are straight. I can heal you! Your eyeses on me! Like Hercules. Yes, you're strong. - Come on. - I'm strong! Thanks a lot. Come on! - Thank you, Sir. - Dad, your belt. Don't interrupt your father when he's speaking! Now you have to heal my wife. - I don't need to be healed. - Shut up! Your eyeses on me! - Your eyeses on me! - Here I am. Idiot, we're not in that theater. Go! - You have to become a woman. - A very sweet woman. - Very sweet. - A housewife. You'll no longer come to the store making jealous outbursts. - Are you done? - Are you done? - I mean, are you done? - Yes. Well, thanks. Now let's go home! Goodbye. And now, all your eyeses on me! Dad, can I go to Antonietta's to get a book? Forget about "him". I'll tell you when you can read books. Now clean those peas. And from now on the whole family must be at the table at mealtime. - Stop going east or west. - Of course, your father's right! Very good, Margherita. That's the spirit. - Have all the IOUs been paid? - I wrote down everything here. - You've made a miracle. - Well... But you realized what it means to work at the store? And you realized what it means to work at home? - Don't talk about it. - Look at him. He's losing a button. His jacket is wrinkled. Now I have to iron it. Where's the iron? - Ah, here it is. - No, here we go again! What are you doing, Peppe? This dummy's breaking his teeth to crack nuts! There's this iron. You thought I wanted to iron his jacket? - What a fright! - You're a dummy. I'm a man. Don't you see, don't you hear me? What did that hypnotist say? You'll be back to normal. Your eyeses on me! Hands on your head, this way. Shut your eyeses. No, you keep them open. Kiss your husband. Excuse me. The End
