[People talking, indistinct] - You would have done a really wonderful job. - [Man]: Congratulations! - Hi, everybody. The S&P Index is up, and so is the Lipstick Index! [Crowd laughs] Uh, all kidding aside, I would like to propose a toast to this wonderful team who really exceeded all our expectations with the Fall into Fabulous campaign. Um... [Clears throat] And we did so while we maintained a commitment to 100%, uh, eco-friendly products. [Exhales loudly] I am so sorry. Um... So, um... If we can please raise our glasses, um... [Gasping] - [Woman]: Should we call someone? - You should sit down. Just relax. - [Woman]: What's wrong, Mrs. Bennet? - Can you please call 911? - And I'll call your husband right away. - It's OK, Christy! - Mitch... - It's OK. It's OK. - My baby! - I'm right here with you. - OK. [Siren wailing] - [Doctor]: I'm so sorry for your loss. Our tests showed her coagulation factors were abnormal. Um... After 3 in-vitro procedures and the subsequent miscarriages, I'm afraid there's a high likelihood she won't be able to conceive. I think you should allow yourselves to grieve and then consider the other options. - Thank you. [Sighs] - I don't know. Maybe the fact that we can't make a decision about a surrogate's a sign that we shouldn't do this. - Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Are you getting cold feet? - And what if this doesn't work out either? I just-- I can't go through any more disappointment. - Hey... Everything is gonna be fine. All right? - I don't know if I'm meant to be a mother. - Hey, listen to me. Listen to me. Just 'cause you can't physically have a baby does not mean you're not meant to be a mother. You are gonna be an amazing mother. - Yeah?- Yeah. - I have interviewed a lot of candidates. You have an excellent batch of potential surrogates to choose from. - Sounds great! - Shall we start? - Yes!- Let's do it. - OK... This is Amy Simms. She's 32. She's a single mother with one son. - Has she done this before? - Three times. - Oh... - So having children is her job? - She does regard it as a key source of income. - I--I just don't like the idea of our child coming from someone who's essentially a professional incubator. - I can understand that, but the fact that this represents her livelihood means she takes it very seriously. - I do like the idea of going with someone who's three for three. - Uh, well, Amy did suffer one miscarriage, but it was in the first trimester. - Do they know what caused it? - It's sad, but sometimes these things just happen. - Mm-hmm. They do. - Yeah. - OK. I read that couples instinctively feel they'll know when they've met the right surrogate and I just-- I don't feel it with her. - Me neither. No, sorry. - I have a policy of not trying to influence my clients, but I'm going to break my rule with this one. Her name is Mallory Parkes. She's 31, no children. She's educated, polite. Absolutely lovely. - Mm-hmm... - Has she ever been a surrogate before? - No.- Ah. - Isn't it odd, going through all this before having a child of your own? - It's not the norm. It's much more common with altruistic surrogacy. - But what do you think of her? - I like her. - What do you think? - I think we should meet her. - Good! One for the "yes" pile. We're just getting started. [Horn honking] - I never do drugs. I rarely drink. Oh, and I wouldn't have so much as a drop of alcohol when I was pregnant. Same goes for coffee. Cool. So you're a non-smoker? - I tried it once in junior high, and that was enough. - Uh, what about your diet? - I eat healthy, minus the odd sugar binge. - OK. - Oh, it's fine. I have a sweet tooth I'll be passing along. Um... Exercise. - Exercise, yeah. - Yeah, do you like to exercise? - I don't know if I like it. But I do it. - OK, that would be my genes. - I mean, I would treat this baby like--like it were my own. I really would. - OK. [Clears throat] - Well, now for the--the obvious question, um... - Why would I wanna do this? - Right. Is it for the money? - Well, that's important. I'm saving up to get my degree in early childhood education. - Really? - That's cool. I like that. - But that being said, there are other ways to pay for college that don't involve morning sickness and stretch marks. - So it's not just about the money? - No. My mom was a surrogate for her cousin. I mean, I was really young, but I saw... I saw how it changed her life, how it changed both their lives. I mean, what a gift to give someone. - Wow. It's true. - I'm really impressed with you. - Yeah, definitely. I mean, we have other people... - Yeah, we have to interview other candidates. It was nice to meet you. - Wait, do I-- Wait, wait. Do I get to ask questions? - Yeah. - Of course. Absolutely. - Why do you want a baby? - Wow! OK. Um... I don't know how to answer that. - Well, I--I just need to know that I'm doing this for the right reasons. This doesn't apply to you, but lots of couples have kids 'cause they're bored or they wanna save their marriage. - Oh! No... - No! - We're in a great place. - So why do you really wanna have a baby this badly? - Um, I've been very lucky and I've achieved everything that I've put my mind to except, um, having a child and being a mother. I've tried 3 times to have a baby and I keep on having miscarriages. - I'm sorry. - So, I don't want that dream of having this family to just end in complete failure. - Thank you. - [Christy]: Is that an OK? - That was a great answer. I hope you don't mind, I-- You know, I had to interview you too. - No. It's nice. I'm glad you asked me that question. I feel it. - Yeah? - Yeah. I think so. - [Both]: Um... - I think that we should tell Beth that we found our surrogate. - Yeah! - Really? [Mallory and Christy laugh] - [Beth]: And in return, the surrogate agrees that Christy and Mitch are the legal parents of the child. - Of course. - In the best interests of the child, she will not form or attempt to form a parent-child relationship. - Wow! Who knew getting pregnant would require so much paperwork! - And now for the best part. You will be paid $35,000 in monthly instalments plus all hospital and doctor bills, maternity clothes and any related expenses from now until... Until 2 weeks post delivery. - Well, here goes! [Horns honking] - I--I know that this is a business arrangement, but I want you to think of me as more than a surrogate. I'm--I'm a friend who's helping you have a baby. - Oh, thank you for everything! - To the baby! - To the baby! Yay! Mmm... Ah... This may be my last drink for a while, I better enjoy it. - You have got such a great eye. Would you help me go shopping for maternity clothes? - I would love to. - You would? - There's the greatest boutique on Michigan Avenue. - Oh, oh! Baby Me, right? - Yes! Baby Me, right? - I know, their stuff is classic, it's not fussy. - Yeah, and you like it. - It's my favourite store. - Oh no! I'm sorry, I just-- I want Christy to be as big a part of the pregnancy as she wants to and same goes for you. - My real contribution will start after the baby shows up. - Yup, 'cause you're gonna get up in the middle of the night and you're gonna change diapers, and feed the baby. - Yeah, of course! I was thinking more along the lines of building a fort and playing catch, but, sure, I'll do that. - You are gonna make such a great dad. - You are. Mm-hmm. - See? - Hey, huddle together. I wanna take a picture to remember this. OK. Ready? Say "babies." - Lookit. Mallory sent me a copy of the photo she took of us. - Oh, that's great! Do you know how happy I am that you two get along? - Yeah? - Yeah! I cannot imagine going through this with someone that you didn't actually like. - I spoke to Alli and she thinks that Mallory sounds so perfect. - Well, if Alli thinks so, then it's gotta be true. [Christy sighs] - What? - I just hope it goes OK. - Come here. It will. - It will. - Mallory! - Hi! - Hey. - Oh... - Big day! - Oh, yeah! I'm excited! - Good. Good. - Oh, new dress... - Oh! - Figured I'd get some wear out of it before I needed to start dressing in tents. - You'll look just as beautiful when you're pregnant. - That's really sweet, Mitch. - Christy should be coming. There she is! - Hey!- Oh, hi! - Wow, you look beautiful. - Thank you. So do you. - Nice to see you. - Wow. - Hey... - Shall we? - [Christy]: Yeah. - All right. - The embryo-transfer procedure is similar to a Pap smear. There shouldn't be any pain. - OK. - Wish me luck! - Good luck. - [Christy]: Thank you for doing this for us. - [Doctor]: OK, that's good. Here we go. And... There. Good. - [Both]: Wow! - [Mitch]: Wow! - Good, Mallory. OK, and now we're... done. Good job. - [Mitch]: It's amazing. - Great. We should know in a few weeks if the embryo has implanted. - [Christy]: OK. - You have a very healthy surrogate. I'm optimistic. - OK. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Bye-bye. - Thank you. - How about we go celebrate this pregnancy? - Oh...- Oh... - I don't know if I wanna jinx it. - Guys! Positive thinking! - Mallory, it's just, we've had our hopes up before... - But, as soon as we hear good news... - [Mitch]: Definitely. - Sure. - OK. So you let us know if you need anything. - I will. - OK. Great. - Thank you. - Bye. - All right! [Sighs] - Bitch. - Right. OK, well, I'm glad you're interested. That's great. OK and yes, I will send you the specs tomorrow for sure. All right. Thank you for your time. Bye-bye. [Sighs] [Kids playing in distance] [Phone rings, Mitch sighs] Yep? Dr. McNally, hey. What's up? [Cell rings] - Hey, you. - [Mitch]: Hey! - What's up? - Um, Dr. McNally called. - She did? - We're gonna be parents. - Are you serious? [Laughs] Oh my God! [♪ Bedouin Soundclash on radio ♪] - ♪♪ Hey ♪ A beautiful day ♪ A beautiful day ♪ Hey ♪ A beautiful day ♪ A beautiful day ♪ When the night ♪ Feels my song ♪ I'll be home ♪ I'll be whole ♪ When the night ♪ Feels my song ♪ I'll be home I'll be whole ♪♪ - [Shrieking]: Hi! [Shrieks] I am so happy! Wow! This is pretty amazing. - Mm-hmm... - If I had known pregnancy would have this kind of effect, I'd have hired a surrogate a long time ago. - And you know what they say? - What do they say? - Pregnancy can be the sexiest time in a relationship. - Oh! Even without the baby bump and the hormones? - Especially without those. [Moaning] - Come here! - What--what about dinner? - Um, I say we work up an appetite, OK? [Doorbell rings] Are you expecting somebody? - No. - Then forget about it. - OK. [Doorbell rings again] I should get it. Yeah I should. - No. - I'm just gonna get it really quickly. Just really... - Don't! Just hurry. - Oh! Hi! - Congratulations! I came as soon as I heard the news! - Wow! Um, hey, Mitch! - Yeah? - Mallory's here. - [Mallory]: Hi, Mitch! - Come on in. - I, um, I brought champagne for you and sparkling cider for me and the baby. - That is so thoughtful. Thank you. - Wow! Your place is beautiful. - Christy decorated it herself. - Oh! You were celebrating and I interrupted. - No, we're just having dinner. - Oh, well, I can come back and we can do this another time. - Definitely. - Besides, I'm pretty hungry myself. Now that I'm eating for two. - You should... Why don't you join us? You can put your cider in the fridge. - Really? - For sure,yeah! - Yes! - I don't wanna be a 3rd wheel. - Oh, come on! - We have so much food. - OK. Thanks. - You're the reason why we're celebrating. [Sighs] She's so excited. - Yeah, I was too! - I promise you that I am gonna make it up to you. - You better. - Yeah. OK. - How long have you been in Chicago? - I moved here about a year ago with my boyfriend, my ex-boyfriend, Greg. We were supposed to get married but, um... Well, that didn't work out. - Aw... - You'll meet another guy. - Sometimes I'm not so sure. - You will. - Oh, come on. You're smart, you're beautiful. Of course you will. - I'm not good at meeting people. My impending water retention isn't gonna help. - Well, your breasts going up a cup size or two can't hurt. I'm just saying. - I can't believe you said that. - It's OK. I think he's funny. - Thank you. She thinks I'm funny. - Oh. - You are funny. - I think that it will put a damper on your dating life. - It's worth it. - Here, have some. - I should go. But thank you. - You're sure? - Mm-hmm. Thank you for dinner. No, no, no! Don't--don't get up. I'll let myself out. - OK. - I already feel like part of the family. - Any time. - Great. - [Christy]: Well, you outdid yourself. Dinner was fabulous. - [Mitch]: It was my pleasure. But you see all those dishes over there? They're all yours. Good night! - Good bye! - [Christy]: Bye! - Don't get me wrong. She's very sweet. - Yeah. - Just, um, a little needy. - How did she get our address? - Sure, the contract. Didn't you say something about making the wait worth my while? - I did. [♪ Rock-a-bye Baby ♪] - [Woman]: Tranquil, isn't it? - I'll take it. Also... I'd like to register for gifts. - Absolutely. - Oh! [Chuckles] [Scanner beeps] - Mrs. Bennet? - Oh... - Congratulations. - Thank you. - [Doctor]: There. Good. Everything looks like it should for 18 weeks. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Thank you for letting us come today. - One weird, modern, happy family, right? - Wanna hear the baby's heartbeat? - [All]: Yes! - [Doctor]: OK. [Heartbeat] - [Mitch and Christy]: Oh! - Hey... That's our baby. - It's amazing. - [Christy]: That's our baby! - Would you like to know the sex? - [Mallory]: Yes! - [Mitch and Christy]: No! - You guys don't wanna know what colour to paint the baby's room? - No, we definitely wanna be surprised. - Oh. It's your choice. - Here's Baby's first picture. Right there. - Look! - [Mitch]: Oh! No way! - Here's the nose, the little eyes! - [Mitch]: Yeah. It's got your nose. [Knocking at door] - Hi, um, my husband took home the sonogram picture. Could you print me another? The girls at the office are dying to see it. - Sure. Here you go. - Thank you. - No problem. [♪ Rock-a-bye Baby ♪] - It's a bit expensive, but it is just so cute. - Wow! Yeah! - What do you think of that? - Oh, that's a little last season, don't you think? - I guess so. - Yeah. It is. - OK. So, how are you feeling? - The morning sickness has pretty much ended. - Mm-hmm... - But nobody tells you that night sweats are what give you that pregnancy glow. It's worth it though. You know, to feel that connection to the baby. I--I know it's your baby, but I'm still feeling those things you're supposed to feel when you become a mother. [Chuckles] - Cool. - Oh, wait. What about this? - Uh-huh... - What do you think? Should I get it? - It's nice. I'm being so silly. - Hey, maybe this weekend, you and I could go shopping for the nursery. - Um, hmm... Thank you, but Mitch and I were thinking about making it a day of it. You know, like a nest building thing. - Oh! No, no, no. I get it. You guys wanna feel like real parents since you're not able to experience having the baby. I can't decide. I'm just gonna get both? - OK. - Thank you. - Let me check. Um, Tuesday's fine. Yep! I will see you then. Thanks very much. Bye-bye. [Sighs] [Doorbell rings] - Mallory! - Can I talk to you? - Uh, yeah. Christy's at work. - No, I figured. It'll--it'll just take a second. - Sure. Come on in. - What do you think of my new dress? - Wow! It's--it's really nice. - Glad you like it. You paid for it. - Um... [Clears throat] How--how are you feeling? - Pretty good overall. - Mmm! - Except my breasts have been so tender and sensitive. - Um, I mean, isn't that normal? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Oh, and this is kind of embarrassing but, my sex drive is out of control. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. I don't know. It's a hormonal thing that happens to some women. - Right, I heard that. Yeah. - And, uh, I've been having these dreams, and you were in one. You made an appearance in one of my dreams. - You said you had something to talk about. - Oh. Oh, yeah, sit down. - Yeah. - It's um... It's kind of awkward. It's, uh, it's about Christy. - Is everything all right? - You know we went shopping for maternity clothes? Well, I caught her trying on a pregnancy belly. - I'm not following. - I mean, it's obvious to me how hard this is on her. The fact that she doesn't share the natural bond with the baby that I do. - Well, there's nothing we can do about that. - Well, I was thinking you could take a more active role and we could give Christy some distance without, you know, making it obvious. - Mm-hmm... - Mm-hmm. - I appreciate your concern, but, Mallory, um, Christy's involvement outweighs any--any problems she might be experiencing. - Oh yeah. Whatever you think is best. - Good. Great. Um, I actually have to get back to work. But thank you. Thank you. - Oh, I'm so glad we can be open enough with each other to have these kinds of conversations. - Me too. OK? - OK. - Terrific. I'll just get your coat. There you go. - Bye. - Bye. - It was a good chat. - Agreed. - What? Mallory's worried about me? - She just... Yeah, I mean, she just thinks that this whole thing is hard on you. [Scoffs] - Of course it's hard on me. - I know! - I mean, do you think that it's easy having this total stranger carry our child? - No, of course not. - So what did you say to her? - I said that I think it's important for Christy to be involved. - Of course! W-what's her alternative? That we're just gonna show up at the hospital when she's ready to give birth? - I don't know. She said that I should pick up the slack. - Oh my God! - What? - She was coming on to you, wasn't she? - What? No. - Yeah, she was. - You're kidding me? No! - Yes. - Oh my God. Are you serious? - I'm serious. - I'm gonna grab you another drink, and we are not talking about Mallory anymore tonight. OK? - [Christy]: She keeps making passive-aggressive comments, reminding me that she's the one giving birth. And then she shows up at our house and tries to convince Mitch that I'm losing it. So I want you to tell me if I'm being overly sensitive or if she's off? - Well, I'd say maybe it's a bit of both. - So what do you think I should do? - Maybe limit your interaction with her. What matters, really, Christy, is the baby's health. So whatever you can do to keep your surrogate happy... It's just a few months. I'd say do it. - You're right. - It'll all be fine, Christy. - OK, I'll talk to you later. - OK, bye-bye. Call anytime. - Bye. [Sighs] [Siren wailing, horns honking] - First time in prenatal? - Yes. Up till now, I could keep up with my regular class. - One day you're touching your toes, the next, you can't even see them. I'm Allison. - Oh, Mallory. - Nice to meet you. - You have kids? - Yeah, two. My son just turned 3 and my daughter's 8 months. - I hope I can bounce back as quick as you. What's your secret? - Teach a yoga class. You get paid to exercise. This is your first? - First of many, if you ask my husband. Mitch loves kids. He's already baby-proofing the house. I keep telling him we have a few months, but he can't wait. He's just so excited. - Sounds like a keeper! Anyway, it was nice to meet you. See you in class on Thursday? - Definitely. - Great! [Cell rings] - Can you-- Can you hang on one sec? - Sure. - OK. Hello? - [Mallory]: Mitch, it's a disaster! - What-- Are you OK? Is it the baby? - A pipe burst in my apartment. There's water everywhere! - Um... - Please, you have to come over right now! - I'm sorry, I can't. I'm in a meeting with a potential client. - Please! I don't know who else to call. - Mallory, I can't come. - I'm worried about the baby. Please hurry! - OK, OK. - Hurry! - I'll take care of it. [Knocking at door] - I'm coming, Mitch! [Sighs] - Who are you? - Plumber. Mr. Bennet said you have a problem. - Bathroom's around the corner. [Phone dialing] - Even the floors, they'll be able to--to collect heat in the winter but they'll be able to release it in the summer. So really, it's the ideal solution for you. [Cell ringing] [Mitch sighs, groans] - [Christy]: No, it's too early. - It's Mallory. Baby, it's Mallory. Hey, Mallory. It's Christy and Mitch. You're on speaker phone. How are you doing? - [Christy]: Hey... - This whole thing was a mistake! - What? What was? - Agreeing to have your baby! I hate being pregnant. I am fat and disgusting... - No, no. That's not true. - Oh, yes it is. And I'm all alone. There's nobody here to help me. - You're not alone. We're both here for you. - Well, it feels like you're trying to avoid me! - Mallory, I know that this is really hard. - Do you, Christy? Do you know that this is hard? How could you know? Because the only reason I am pregnant is because you can't be! I cannot be pregnant for one more night! I'm not doing it. I am done. - What are you talking about? - Mallory? How about I come over right now? Would that be good? [Sniffs] - Yeah. - You have a presentation in the morning. I can get back to bed. All right? - OK. - Well, hurry up. -I'll be right there. [Sighs] I don't like it either, but what choice do we have? - I've seen the way she looks at you. - Christy... - Don't-- Oh! Don't tell me I'm being paranoid. - This is not the same. - It sounds the same. "Oh, I have to take care of something at the office. "Don't wait up for me." - How long am I gonna have to pay for a mistake? - A mistake is something you make once. Not over and over and over again. - Yes, I screwed up. I screwed up, OK? And you have every reason to be suspicious of me, but this is about the baby, OK? - I don't know what she's capable of. - That's exactly why I want to go there right this second. [Honking] [Knocking] - Hi. - Thank you so much for coming over. - Yeah. Sure. - Come in. Come in. - Better? - Yeah. Let me get your coat. I'm so sorry I dragged you out of bed. - No, it's good prep for having the baby, right? - You must think I'm a whiny bitch. - No! I think you're... I think you're pregnant. - Sit down. - Yeah. OK. Oh. Yeah. [Sighing] - It's just so hard going through this all alone. Even my stupid ex-boyfriend would be better than this. Well, except he'd just say that I was fat and disgusting. - Well, then he's a complete jackass, that's what he is. - You see that? It took you 2 seconds to figure him out. - Mm-hmm? - It took me 2 years. Do you still think I look OK? - No, I think you look beautiful. And you know what, Mallory? This is all gonna be over in about 2 months and you're gonna feel great, OK? - I wasn't counting on how lonely this would feel. - Mallory, you're not alone. Uh, Christy and I are here for you. Whatever you need. We told you that. - Yeah, sure, you guys buy me stuff but who's--who's here to help me with the apartment when I need something done or I don't know, rub my shoulders when I am so sore I can barely move? - Set up a massage appointment, OK? It's gonna be our treat, I promise. - That's nice but, I'm stiff right now. [Sighing] Will you, please, just for a second? - No, that's actually-- No, it's not appropriate. - I don't understand. You're gonna be in the delivery room. It's such an intimate thing and you can't even rub my shoulders? - No. - Don't do it for me. Do it for the baby. - Your neck? [Cracking] - Did you hear that? - Yeah, I heard that. All right. - See, I'm so tense... - What part? - Right here. - Right there.- Yeah. See? - It's OK. - It's bad for the baby to have lots of tension. - You're right. OK. Is that good? - Yeah. I could get used to this. [Moaning] Mmm, that feels good. Thank you. [Cell ringing] [Moaning] No, don't answer it. - It's... It's Christy. Yep? Hey, babe. Uh, yeah. Oh yeah. She's doing much better. - [Whispering]: I'm so sore. - OK. I'm on my way right now. [Chuckling] OK. OK. Love you. Bye. I gotta go. - Hey, I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Would you come? - Good, good. I'll check my schedule and I'll definitely let you know. - Please? - We'll see. We'll see. - It would mean a lot. - OK. We'll definitely see. You're doing better? - Yeah, thank you. - Perfect. You're welcome. - OK. See you tomorrow! - Bye! - Bye. [Sighing] [Telephone ringing] [Sighing] You can leave if you want. I'll just pass along any news. - No, that's OK. I'd like to stay. [Groaning] Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. It's just the baby kicking. It's like a circus in there. Do you wanna feel? - Yeah. Oh. Yeah. - Cool, huh? - It's cool. - Christy, about last night... - Yeah. Wow, you really scared us. - I know. I know. And I'm sorry. I hope you know I'd never do anything to hurt the baby. - I do know that. Thank you. [Cell beeping] Oops. Sorry. [Scoffing] - What is it? - Oh, um... It's my friend who was just texting me this ridiculous picture of decorations that she bought for my shower. - You're having a baby shower? - Yeah. I mean, it's no big deal. It's just, it's some friends from work and... - Oh. Yeah, sure. - Mallory, I--I thought of inviting you, but then I thought it might make you feel awkward. - It wouldn't make me feel awkward. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - OK! Great! Well, would you like to come? - I would love to. - OK. Good. That's great. So you really don't think it's weird that I'm having my surrogate attend my baby shower? - No, not really. - When we picked her, she was self-sufficient, confident, and now she's just needy. She's half-crazy. She's calling Mitch's cell in the middle of the night. - Are you worried because she's calling Mitch? - No! Mitch and I are in a good place. - Good. - What do you think? - Wow! Surrogacy does have its benefits. - Look how cute these are! - Open mine next. - Oh, thank you! - Just a little something. - OK. - Yep! - The big one's coming later. - Oh, look at this. - Since you don't know the sex, I picked something that worked for either a boy or girl, and what baby wouldn't love you? - That is so sweet. I love you so much. - Oh, I love you to. You're gonna be great. [Sighing] - Sorry I'm late. - Hey! - Mallory, hi! - Hi. - What a coincidence! How do you two know each other? - Oh, Mallory's my surrogate. - [Mallory]: Hi. - I can't believe you've been telling people it's your child. - I know, but I needed support. - What? Mitch and I have been here for you. - I know and I appreciate that. But I needed to talk to real moms about what I was going through. - OK, you're gonna remind me again that I'm not capable of having a child, right? - Christy, I didn't mean that. - You could've still talked to moms while telling the truth. - Well, I know this sounds silly, but I felt that if they knew that I was just a surrogate, they'd treat me differently, like a freak or something. - This isn't normal behaviour. - I know. Don't you think I know that? I'm not thinking straight. I think it's the hormones. - You can't keep on blaming the hormones anymore. You have to take responsibility for your actions. - I know, OK? But please know that I am doing everything I can for your baby. - OK. Promise me you're not gonna lie anymore, please? Please. - I promise. I won't do it anymore. It won't happen again. - OK. If you wanna go out there and join the party, I'll be there in a sec. It's fine. - OK. I'm sorry. - It's OK. [Chuckles] - I don't know how you could be so understanding. - What am I suppose to do? She's holding my child hostage inside of her. - Christy, she wasn't just asking me about having a baby, she was talking about raising one. Baby names, diaper rash, mommy-and-me classes. And the husband she's been describing... It's Mitch. I think she has some kind of fantasy that she's going to raise this baby with him. I mean, she's... - She's crazy. - Yeah. What are we gonna do? - I'm gonna ride it out. - OK. - OK. Let's go have a good time. - Let's go in there. I'll get you a drink. - Totally. I love this so much. - For babies! - Thank you. - Open mine next. [Grunts] - Oh! - You really didn't have to get me a present. - I know, but I wanted to. - OK. Thank you very, very much. Oh, that's so sweet. - Isn't it cute? - Yeah, it's really cute. - Apparently babies can hear voices and sounds in the womb, so I've been singing it to him. Oops! Surprise! I said it. It's a boy. We're having a boy! - We're having a boy? - Yeah. - If you'll excuse me for a second... - Christy! Christy, come on! - Mallory, get out. - Why? - I'm trying to be understanding because that's what Christy wants, but this is to much. - I made a mistake. I'm sorry. - It wasn't a mistake and you aren't sorry either. - I don't know what the big deal is. So, Christy knows she's having a boy. - It is a big deal to Christy. This is her baby. - It's my baby too. - No, it's not. Once it's born, you'll have nothing more to do with them, you understand? - Oh! - Are you OK? - What? What's the matter? - Just give me a second. - What? - I don't know! - Christy! - Aaah! - Just breathe. You're fine. - Stop talking! Christy? - What's happening? - Christy? - Just breathe. - What is it? - I think I'm going into labour. [Groaning] - It's OK. It's OK. - Oh, no, no, no! - No, it's OK. - I'm not ready. He's not supposed to come for another couple weeks. Aaah! - It's OK. Just breathe. - Ow, it hurts! - I know. - It hurts! Ah! - It's OK. - Ow! - Here, here. Here. - I'm gonna breathe on my own! - I don't know. - Is the baby OK? - She's experiencing Braxton Hicks. - Wait, that's false labour. - It's common for first-time moms to confuse it with the real thing. - OK, but is the baby OK? - Everything's as it should be. - Hi. - Hey. - I'm sorry. - Mallory, I mean, you couldn't have known, right? - Braxton Hicks are often caused by dehydration so you need to make sure you drink plenty of liquids. [Clearing throat] - So, uh, what now? What do we.... - Well, Ms. Parkes is fine to go home. Do you have someone to keep an eye on you? - I'm all alone. - I'd feel better if you had someone to watch over you, at least overnight, just to be safe. Do you have any family in town? - I'm all alone. There's nobody. - I think that you should stay with us. - Christy?- Yeah. - Are you sure? I don't want to impose. - No, I would love you to stay with us. - Yeah, definitely. - OK, OK. - All right? Thank you. - Come on. - My pleasure. - Mallory? I left you some towels. And we're just down the hall if you need anything, OK? - Uh, Mitch, um... I'm sorry. I'm sorry about tonight. I'm sorry about letting it slip you're having a boy. I'm sorry about everything. - Mallory, it's all right. We're in the final home stretch right now. And the baby's health is what really matters, so... - Come here. Come here. I want you to feel something. Come here, the baby's kicking. Come feel it! Come feel it. Right, right... - Right there? - Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, right... Do you feel that? - Yeah! Oh yeah! - That's your son. - Wow! Well, I think we've got a soccer player on our hands. [Laughing] - Either that or a black belt. - Yeah! Maybe. [Whispering]: God. [Sighing] Sleep well, OK? - Mm-hmm. You too. - Yeah. - Good night. - Good night. - Hey, can you come to bed? - Yeah, I'm just gonna take a quick shower. - OK, please come soon. Having her here really gives me the creeps. - Hey! - Hey. - It's only for one night. OK? - OK. - Soon, this is all gonna be over. - Yeah. - And you are never gonna have to see her again. - OK. - OK. I'll be right back. - OK. - Christy? Honey? [Siren wailing in distance] [Moans] - How are you doing? - I'm tired. I haven't slept. - Hey. - Mm-hmm? - How would you feel about us checking into that new hotel downtown for the weekend? We can forget all about you know who. Hmm? Come on, it's gonna be the last opportunity for us to get away for a while. - Yeah. We're not gonna leave that hotel room. OK. Book it. Do it. [Clattering] [Grumbling] - Oh, sorry about the mess, but I couldn't find anything. I hope you like eggs Benedict. - Wow! - Wow! - This is great! - Thanks. I love to cook. I'm glad, uh, that you're feeling better. - Much better. It's amazing what a good night's sleep will do to ya. Oh, I made you egg whites because I know you're watching your figure. - Oh... - What, you think I poisoned it? - No, that's not what I was about to say. I think that this is really great that you made this and I'm grateful. - Definitely. - Thanks. I wanted to show my appreciation for you opening up your home to me. - Oh, come on. It's no problem. - Of course. - And also to say... to apologize for being a little... off lately. I guess I was naive, but I had no idea being pregnant would be this difficult. - Right. - I'm glad you're feeling better. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, I'm going to this photo exhibit tonight if you want to come. - Oh, Christy and I actually made plans to go away for the night. - Yeah, I get it. You wanna get away while you still can. - [Mitch]: Right, right. - OK, I should go, but, um... Well, thanks for letting me crash and I'm so sorry about the mess. - That's OK. - We're on our cell, if anything at all happens. - Yeah. Oh, um, have a good night away. - Thank you. - Thanks for cooking. - [Mallory]: Bye. - Bye. [Siren wailing in distance] [♪ Man singing on stereo, indistinct ♪] [Sighing] - For the beautiful lady. - So, uh, there's a certain subject that we've been avoiding. - OK, if this has anything to do with Mallory, she does not exist tonight. - No, we have to pick a baby name. [Chuckling] - Wow! Well, thanks to a certain somebody, we know that it's a boy's name. - Yes. - Any thoughts? [Cell ringing] - I knew that this was too good to be true. - I don't know if it's from Mallory. It's from a private number. - You should answer it. - Hello. Yeah? Yes. Oh yes, I'm very happy with my cell provider. No, actually, thank you. I've never been so happy to get a call from a telemarketer in my entire life. - Is this the first night that we've gone without any Mallory drama? - Mm-hmm. Why are you so gorgeous tonight?

Oh, hello. - We had a deal that I wouldn't be in his life, not that I couldn't hold him. Please. Mitch? Please? - I think it's for the best. - You're just saying that because she's here. - We should finish in another room. - He's my son! I need to hold my son! - You're going to have to calm down or I'll need to sedate you. - All right, let's go. It's OK. - I hate you, Christy. - We'll wire the final payments into your account. - Where are you taking him? - Thank you for everything you've done, but we do not want any more contact with you. - You bitch! You will never be his mother! I am his mother! I am his mother! No, I'm his mother. - Calm down! Mallory! - I'm his mother! - You have to calm down. - No! No! Shut up! - It's so cute, his little hand is like that. That's amazing. - I wish that I could sleep this peacefully. - Well, maybe you will now that Mallory's out of the picture. - Yeah. - I'm so sorry that she ruined this experience for you. - I can't hate the woman that gave us William. - William? Really? - Yeah, what do you think? After my grandfather. William. - Billy the kid. - Yeah. - Oh, I love it. - Yeah? - I love it.

[Sobbing] - Mitch. - Hmm? - Mitch. - What? - Where's the baby? - What? - Mitch, where's the baby? Help! My baby! [♪ Humming ] - Ma'am, please give me the baby. - Just let me do this, OK? - I need you to give me the baby. - It's OK, I got it. Just, please. I got it. Mallory? Mallory? Hi. I want you to hand me the baby, OK? - I just wanted to hold him. - I know. I know. I just want you to hand him to me now. - I love Greg. I would never do anything to hurt him. - I know and I'm not angry. I just want you to hand him to me. OK? Come on. - Do you wanna go see your daddy? Do you wanna go see your dad? - Come on. - [Whispering]: I love you. Let's go see daddy. - There we go. I got him, I got him. - No! Let go of me! - If I see you again, we are calling the police. Do you understand me? - Oh yeah? Mitch! Let go of me. - You stay the hell away from us. - Ow! Let go of me! - [Nanny]: And I was their nanny until a month ago when Mr. Taylor was transferred to St. Louis. - Oh, OK. Do you have training in first aid? - Well, I can't do open-heart surgery, but I'm a pretty skilled boo-boo fixer. [Chuckling] - Good. OK, um, I think we've heard all we need. Um, we're going to have to follow up with your references. - Oh, of course. - Would you be willing to submit to a background check? - [Mitch]: Right. - If that's OK. - Sure. - OK. - I'm sorry, it's just we're... we're actually normally a laidback, normal couple. It's just we had a bit of an issue with our surrogate. - And as I was carrying his child, Mitch and I fell in love and now we want to be a family. I mean, surely, the law must allow for the true biological parents to claim their own child. - To clarify, it was her egg? - Well, yes. - The mother has all the rights in this situation. - I am the mother! - Technically you gave birth, but legally, you have no more claim to the child than I do. - This isn't fair. I carried him for 9 months. - Your contract specifically states that you relinquish any and all rights that comes to the child. - People break contracts all the time. - Surrogacy's a hot-button topic. It's not even legal in every state. And for you to overturn this, you'd need to go all the way to the Supreme Court, and by then, your kid will be applying to college. - Please, there must be something you can do. - The baby's father wants to be with you? - Yes. - Then the best option is to have him file for divorce, take a stab at shared custody. - Hi. - Hey. Aren't we supposed to sleep when he sleeps? - I like watching him sleep. - I know, but we have our whole lives to watch him and only a few hours to sleep. [Chuckling] - If we're lucky. - Come to bed. [Telephone ringing] - OK. I'll see you. - Let the answering machine get it. Come on. - OK. [Answering machine beeps] - Hi, Mitch. It's Jessica. - I told you never to call me here again. - I'm sorry, but it's about your baby. - What is it? - [On speakerphone] I need to show you something. - Whatever it is, you can tell me over the phone. - You have to trust me, Mitch. It's something you really need to see. It's about Mallory Parkes. - How do you know Mallory? - Just come over. - No! - Oh God! - Please. I wouldn't call you if I didn't think it was really important. [Sighing] - I haven't spoken to Jessica since the night I ended things with her. You have to trust me. - When I just heard her voice, I remembered everything that you've put me through, everything that you did to me. - I know, and I'm so sorry, Christy. - How the hell does your ex-mistress know Mallory? - I don't know, but we gotta find out! - What am I suppose to do? Am I supposed to be cool with you going to her house because she wants to show you something? - I don't know. - What if she's lying? What if she's just manipulating you because she wants to see you again? - I don't know. I seriously doubt that's the case, OK? But it's a chance that we gotta take, right? - I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. [Sighing] - Hi. - Why did you call our house? - There's something you need to see. Please. Here. - Oh my God. How do you know Mallory? - I went to college with her. And when Mitch and I were together, I talked about him with her. About how difficult the fertility issues were, how badly he wanted to be a father. - My fertility issues. So, Mitch knew Mallory from before? Is that what you're saying? - No. They never met in person. But when her boyfriend, Greg, broke up with her she developed this strange fixation on him through my photos and stories. - I have no idea what you're talking about right now. - Greg never wanted children. He was really clear about that. Mallory thought she could change him, and she couldn't. I think that's why she just got really obsessed with Mitch. The fact that he really wanted to have children... - Why wouldn't you tell us this before? - I had no idea she was your surrogate. And Mitch and I have not spoken... And I put some distance between Mallory and I when Greg dumped her, because she just started behaving really erratically. He said she was stalking him, that she put his new girlfriend in the hospital by cutting her brakes. I thought you should know. - I can't believe this. - I'm so sorry. [Sighs] [Knocking at door] - Who is it? - Police, Ms. Parkes. I need you to explain something to me. [Chuckles] - Is there a law against making a joke? - No, but there is against stalking. - I think Christy's overreacting just a little, don't you? - I was told you entered the Bennet home without permission. - I've been invited over lots of times. - I'm referring to the time that they came home to find you in their nursery. - Oh. Well, they've been so good to me, I--I wanted to decorate it for them. - Without them knowing? - Well if they knew, it wouldn't be a surprise now, would it? - I also understand you took their baby in the hospital? - Yes, to give Christy a rest. This is ridiculous. Do I look like a stalker? - I don't know. Maybe we should ask your ex-boyfriend Greg what he thinks. - Am I under arrest? - No. But if I have to come back, you will be. Nice place. - So nothing like this has ever happened before to one of your clients? - Never. It's normal for the surrogate to feel a sense of loss-- - No, no, no! Excuse me. This is not post-partum depression. She was obsessed with Mitch for a long time before we'd even considered surrogacy. - Well, how could I know that? - Because it's your job! - I understand that you want someone to blame. I scoured her background. - Obviously not well enough. - She has no recorded history of mental illness, no arrests. She seemed the perfect surrogate. - Beth, she's mentally ill! Did you know that she tried to do to her ex-boyfriend exactly what she's doing to us? - No. - Or that she might have tried to kill his new girlfriend? - Have you got the police involved? - Yes, we do have the police involved. - They spoke to her. They told her to stop. Big deal! - Well, hopefully, that should be the end of it. - Right. - Well, I hope so, Beth. - [Mallory]: ♪♪ The cradle will fall ♪ Rock-a-bye baby in the tree top ♪ - What are you doing? - Shhh!

She's not gonna hurt your baby. - How do you know she won't? - She's crazy. - Believe me, that's not how these situations play out. In abductions, strangers hurt kids. Their mothers don't. - She's not his mother. - But she thinks she is. She does. - Exactly. Mallory is delusional. That's actually good for us. She's going to treat your child like it's her own.

Why would she do that? - Mallory wants a family. - Right. - Her plan isn't complete until you're in her life. - You think she's actually gonna call Mitch? - I hope so. - So I said: "Mitch, um, "if you wanna make him into a basketball player, "that's fine, but let's wait for him to crawl first." [Laughs] - There's a play group that meets here on Thursdays, with lots of other young moms, if you're interested. - Thanks. My family and I need to go away for a little while, but when I get back, I'd love that. Or--or--or maybe we could get them together for a play date. Or--or--or we should join the same Mommy and Me group. - Um, maybe. I better get going. It was nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you. I'll see you soon. Right? See you soon? - Say bye. - Bye-bye. Bye!

I miss my son, but I know you'd never do anything to hurt him. - I knew you'd understand. I'm not a bad person. - I know that. - I--I just wanna do what's right for Greg, even if I'm gonna get in trouble. - Well you did it because you love our son. - More than anything! -And because you love me. - I do. I love you so much. I just wanna be a family, Mitch, and have as many kids as you want to. Do you wanna have more children with me? Do you? - Yeah, I do. - So you'll divorce Christy and you'll be with me? - Yes, I will. And I want you to move in with me. And I want us to raise Greg together.
