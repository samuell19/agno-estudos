THE HOUSE OF IMAGES People like to say that Paris contains mysteries. They even say that its heart still conceals a number of secrets In reality, each one of us discovers through our loves or our daily strolls a particular presence which haunts these areas and gives them a face, according to some, a soul, according to others. Among these twenty faces of Paris, the reflections of its suburbs, that of Montmartre seems particularly connected to painting, so close is its resemblance, in its deepest nature, to those qualities that its most faithful artists have captured. In these places, which bring to mind so many historical memories, those of the Chevalier de la Barre, formerly named Rue des Rosiers, where the communal traditions, lost over time, those of the Rue de l'Abreuvoir, of the Calvaire steps, there lives a community of artisans, quiet, simple, modest, almost invisible among the daily hubbub. These are artists who start their day at the same time, as the sun rises over the village they all love and which was a pretty countryside not that long ago. Hi Mayo! How are things? - A glass of juice as usual? - Yeah. And a shot of calvados, please. It's only two steps away from the old houses of the Place du Tertre from those old houses of long tradition from Mother Catherine's, where André Huter often sat down, from the café of the town hall, that are still to be found, just outside the gardens of Rue Cortot, those who have sent forth around the world so many images conceived in silence and thought. The silence of the artist's studio, while the first warm days of May bring the flood of tourists seeking souvenirs of Paris, souvenirs of Montmartre. Still, there are other memories there, close by, like in the old Saint Peter cemetery with its image of places where the residents resided during their lifetime. "Wanderer who passes by," says an epitaph "respect the gentleness and virtues of Angélique Méjean" "who died 17 years old on 14 prérial, year X." The warning is futile. Standing before such a famous basilica no visitor will think of disturbing Angélique's sleep, taken as he is by the picturesque quality of the figurines ornamenting the shop window of this striking construction which hosted the Jerusalem Panorama at the time of the Exposition of 1900. Is there a mystery hidden behind this facade? Let's follow this man who ascends the rough steps of Rue Foyatier and gets to his usual workplace. He's a printer. And the man who is joining him there He's an engraver. The Jerusalem Panorama has collapsed and over its ruins has risen a workshop where the great and difficult traditional craft of intaglio engraving is being kept alive. There is only a handful left in France, maybe thirty men, who, without the help of machines but by the sheer skill of their craft, see to it that the most beautiful engravings and the most beautiful illustra- tions for deluxe editions are made. Saying that hard work and discipline are lost causes has become a platitude these days. And yet, ... these men, in love with their fine craft, know that without time and effort no task can be worthily accomplished. One could say as does a spectator watching a magician's show: There must be some trick to it. No. There is no trick here. No mystery either, and apparently not even a secret. It's all about making this paradox become a reality: mass-producing works of art for the pleasure of those who are susceptible to the charms of color or the subtlety of forms and at the same time giving each print a unique character. The goal is, through love and labor, to make as if each copy were an original. The only role played by the machine is restricted to pressing the copies in a hand operated press. All the rest is the product of man himself, with the knowledge of his craft and the obedient skill of his hands. This way of producing an engraving isn't very old. It is merely the survival, precious and delicate, of an art which, for over 400 years, has required seven plates of diverse colors in order to stay true to the painter's work. It's the same spirit of accuracy that leads Roger Lacourière to reproduce Rousseau's "The Snake Charmer" for us today. Still, it's not really about imitating the painting, but about applying the richest resources of intaglio engraving to the production of the prints. What is at the origin of this reproduction of Picasso? If we decompose it intellectually we suppress the strokes and then in turn the superposed or juxtaposed tones of red, pink, yellow, green, violet or blue.. In the end there is only a blank plate, symbol of the engraver's solitude, that of every creator, before his raw material. How does the engraver work? How will he give life to this plate, communicate to this dead surface by the simplest of instruments a chisel, a metal point, even a brush, the breath of life? This way of engraving, by chisel, goes back to ancien times. A particularly acute eye is needed and also a delicate hand, which conveys the gesture to the tool. One thinks of the goldsmiths of the 12th century who worked the soft metal, hollowed out both deep and delicate lines which they filled with black paste to accentuate the force or enliven the extreme delicacy. This is the engraving style chosen by Trémois to illustrate Henry de Montherlant's text "Pasiphae", the daughter of the Sun and of Perse who gave birth to the Minotaur. Also to Marcel Jouhandeau's "Endymion", the Greek shepherd, loved by Diana, whose beauty was such that he was sentenced by Jupiter to a perpetual sleep in a mysterious garden. This tool, looking like a big chisel used by a workman, which the artist drives over the plate with a rocking movement, riddles the copper surface with scores of small pleats. The engraver, Robert Naly, who is using the cradle tool, is thus creating a light relief on a dark background on the negative surface of the engraving. The rough edges thus created on the plate are worn down and crushed with scrapers and burnishers which bring out the highlights. For Dunoyer de Segonzac, attuned to both the gravity of theme as well as to the sophistication of the stroke, the pattern is achieved by a metal point on the plate which is protected by a thin polish. The acid will eat into the lines and reveal as it progresses images of great power or of the most delicate refinement. Large sheets of paper that have been softened in water will absorb the thick ink held by the etched lines, becoming illustrations for Ronsard's "Amours". Drypoint is the direct contact of the engraver with the metal. He scratches it, claws it, caresses it. This is the method used by Jean Frélot to depict the tender Touraine light, whose languid softness Charles d'Orléans once sang of. Under other fingers, those of Laboureur, the pen expresses the melancholic landscape of the Brière. Intaglio isn't the only classical means that the engraver has at his hands. Joan Miró, whose imagery suggests the figurative world of childhood draws directly on the copper with a brush charged with a water-soluble sugar solution. By successive etchings, strong or light according to need, the qualities are balanced, from the darkest to the most light. But because the printer's inks have uneven intensity from color to color, a silk bag is used to spread a controlled thickness of powdered resin over the surface, forming a layer of variable depth. The firing fixes the resin, and it is the grain and thickness of this glaze that attenuates or accentuates this blue or that yellow that the lines carved in the metal are going to receive. A little while ago we looked at the still blank copper plate. By these successive etchings, each one receiving its chosen color, over long and silent hours of labor, in which no mark or gesture can be erased, the engraver infuses life into the metal. It's by following the work of the printer, who prepares, mixes, juxtaposes and superposes the color values, that the Picasso engraving is reconstituted for us, as a synthesis of methodic operations, from the first trace of color to the black frame of the line which assures the vital character of it all. The possibilities of intaglio engraving are rich and abundant to such a degree that they permit several different methods to be combined. But this richness doesn't hinder forays into unknown territories. It's true to say that each artist chooses the medium which corresponds with what he includes or omits in the actual or imagined world he's depicting. Thus, Miró, when illustrating Paul Éluard or Michel Leiris, uses painted wood. André Masson proceeds in a completely different way. The world of images that haunts him, inhabited by birds and arabesques, and their subtle or violent meta- morphoses, draws him to the intensity, the radiance, and the sometimes fierce energy of color. But don't think that there is some mystery involved just because Masson places the plates that he has designed directly into the cauldron of acid that devours the copper as if by magic. It's only a chemical reaction supervised by a practitioner. The result being completed, and looking exactly like the original, it receives the mark of its authenticity: the lion brands it with its paw. How sweet to live with the pleasure of these images before one's eyes, made by the engravers for the delight of art lovers, free to admire according to their tastes. Robert Naly, sensitive to the austere tenderness of the Ouessant isle. André Derain, to the charm of an ordinary bouquet. Georges Rouault, to autumn's glories, to the sadness of faces. Georges Braque, to the secret, orderly life of familiar objects. Fernand Léger, to the greatness, the simplicity, the harmony of forms. Miró, to the poetry of colored drawings. André Masson, to the swift flight of birds who pass by like comets. Did this house of images contain a secret? None other, no doubt, than the love found in the heart of man, both artist and laborer, of real artisanship. Subtitles and screener by knappen. Proofread by Kinsayder.
