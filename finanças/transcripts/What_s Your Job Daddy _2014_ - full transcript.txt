Don't shoot, okay. Tell me if you're about to come. That's good. You're doing great. Bravo. How many scenes to go? Two more takes. Legally. Two more takes before ejaculation. - Okay. - Legally. Are we face to face? Yeah, and "butt to butt" as they say in the Olympics. So What should we do? Face to face and then I think he'll film us from behind. Do you want some? I party every Saturday. - Want some? - Yeah. Sit down. Daddy is coming. Where's your book bag? - It's mine. -Wait a minute, okay? Here's your notebook. Should I bring your toy? Oh shit! Hervé, I told you to stop playing with the scooter. All right, I'm sorry. - It's not all right. -I'm sorry. -You're mental, seriously. - Sorry. I'll deal With Leni. I'm taking the stroller. Hurry up, I have a meeting afterwards. - See you later. - Bye, darling. - Say bye to daddy. - Goodbye. Goodbye, sweetie. Let's go. I'm taking the keys. Erma, do you know how to read yet? -All right. - Can you close up? - Yeah. Love you. - Love you too. What are you filming tonight? The car scene. Which one? - The one with Ludovic. - Okay, but which one exactly? I don't remember what it's called. The one we planned... It's the scene with Benhillot and Christina? - No, Karina Testa. - Right, Karina. Ludovic is in the car... Anyway, the one with Karina. Okay. That just proves you're not very clear. I'm telling you, do what you want, but this isn't one of your pornos. I'm asking for two things. First, send me the dialogues beforehand. I can call Leo. - No, I'll do it. - Okay, talk to Leo. Second, no alcohol, not until the end of the shooting. Not in the film and not off set. That was our deal. Hervé, don't act surprised. We made a deal. Those two things. I'm going to drop by tonight... No, Thierry, don't come tonight. I'd rather start slowly. I'll respect your terms. - OK, I won't drop by tonight, then. - Come tomorrow. Tomorrow, if you want. I won't come tonight, but keep me updated every day. You owe me that much. And if Leo does his job, we won't reach a dead end. I think everything will work out but you need a good start. I can't stay much longer. Listen, be strong. - Yeah. -All right. - Thanks, Thierry. - Bye. - I'll see you tomorrow - Yeah. - Bye, Thierry. Thanks. - Call Leo. Yes, I'll call him. Bye. Leni, turn around! Leni, Leni! Turn around. Leni, look at dad. What's wrong? Daddy is bugging you. It's because I want to take you home. You don't want to go home? You said "no"? You can talk now? You said no? Say "daddy". Goon Leni. Are you ready? We're almost done. We'll be ready soon. Arnaud, can you send some smoke, please? -Are you done with this microphone? - Yeah. How's it going? - Great. It's good to see you. -You too. -I didn't hear you get in. - How are you? - Hi, Hervé. - How's it going? Sorry, I'm eating. -You're doing well? -Yeah, I'm okay. - Ready for the big day? - Yeah. Hi, how are you? David, what are you doing here? Everyone will think we're making a porno. I started porn with him. How are you? There will be no film. Hi, how's it going? Can I give you a kiss? No film. That's a good one. Yeah. I don't know how to tell them. - Really? - Yeah. - Hey, Simon! How are you? -I'm doing well. Yeah? Cool. What are you doing? Hi, how are you? -Yeah, I'm doing well. - Good. - How's the camera? - Great. We're ready. -We have the lens... - It's a 25, yeah. Okay. Hey, David. Come take a look. Look, now that's a camera. It's for real films, not the kind we make. We're on time for the shooting. Do you still make pornos? Yeah, why would I stop? I don't know. Why make traditional films? - Does it bother you? - Not at all. - I just don't understand. -I can do both. Victor, if I didn't want to... What would you say if... What would you say if I didn't want to make this film. How would you react? After made a big deal about it. I'd hit you. - Really? You'd kick me? -Yeah, I would. - Where? Show me. - Rig ht there. No, not my balls. What about my job? It's what paid for the film. -You'd really kick me? -Absolutely. So in tell you I won't do the film, you'll kick me. Even though we're friends? We are, but the past month, you've been... Wait, let me make this clear. The script is about... It's about a character who's about to become a father. That's my role. But since I've written it, I've become a father. I have two kids, you know. So the story isn't about me anymore. It doesn't interest me. The film isn't about me, because I'm a dad. I can't talk about a future dad. So if I told you that, you'd still kick me? Look at your film crew. What if I told you... I didn't want to do the film anymore, how would you take it? I'd think you were joking. - It's a joke. - That's how you’d read? Hey guys, what if I told you I'm not making the film. That's heavy. You're freaking us out. What would you say? I'd think it sucks. - Let's go, Hervé. -Wait, I'm talking here. We have to get started. - He's saying he won't make the film. - No, I didn't say that. I'm just making small talk. Yeah, but it's weird... Let's go. David? Do you mind? What would you say? - Ludovic, come here please. -I don't get it. I don't get the point in this. The point is... To push people's limits? If I knew the point, I'd tell you. Ludovic? Karina? Can you come please? I'm going to describe the scene, it's dull compared to this. Karina, come here, sweetie. Please. Thank you. Listen, thank you all for being here. I was kidding around, saying we weren't making the film. But wait, the thing is, I have to be honest. I wanted to say it, but not to everyone at once. I wanted to tell you individually that I won't be making the film. I didn't want to tell you all at once, because I feel bad about the situation. I'm not going to make this film. And I'm going to ask Victor, my photographer friend, not to kick me in the balls. Because l need my balls to feed my two children. I'm not kidding, Karina. You think it's a joke? You've got some nerve. Most of us really need this job. And you said it yourself, we weren't paid much, but we wanted to help you. We trusted you. And you're changing your mind, suddenly. I think you're not being completely honest about how you feel. Maybe you just don't like it. You've been afraid for six months. We've fought for six months to make it happen. And suddenly, the day before... What about the film rights? What should we do with the rights? We'll keep them. It's really frustrating. Wait, I'll pay for today and tomorrow. You're a princess, you want us to hold your hand. I don't know, but I like you. You're very handsome. I don't want to chase a princess who keeps changing her mind. It'll be like that for the entire month of shooting. You want to do it or you don't, just tell us. I'm going to get in the car with Karina and Ludovic. We're here. We're going to think about the script for an hour. I'll come back and change the film so we can start. Karina and Ludovic, come with me please. What are you doing? I'm going to think about it inside the vehicle. - Karina, get in the back seat. -You're leaving? Yes, but we're coming back in an hour. Only one hour. Do you think I could lie with a face like this? I'll be back. Give me an hour. See you soon. There are still things we need to... I'm glad I gave up. If I asked: "did you make up a religion?" Yeah? You remember your lines. What would you answer? I'd say yes. I try to be balanced. Having faith helps me. Yeah? Is it a problem for you, to have kids? Listen, I'm conflicted. I told you. When I was single and selfish, making porn and taking drugs, it was a great business for me. Yeah, but now you have children. So What? Well, they're here. They didn't ask for anything. Yeah, I know. I'd love to have kids but I don't know if I ever will. Really? Yeah. Yeah. It's fucked up, anyway. She wants kids but doesn't have any and... I can't say I don't want kids, it would be ridiculous. -I feel good driving around. -Where are we going? I don't know. I feel so strange, I wanted to hit on you. But don't worry, I won't. Well, there's no use. Why? I'm not your type? That's not the point. Don't bother. -I won't. -So? Aren't you happy with your wife and kids? I have to learn to be happy. That's the thing. I feel better talking with you. I couldn't take it, back there. But wait, Why can't I hit on you? Should we call to say we're not coming back? No, I don't give a shit. Tell me, Why can't I hit on you? How should I know? Why am I scared to hit on you? You're afraid of rejection. I feel wired like a horny dog that can be turned on and off. It pisses me off. I'm 47, I'm still young. Am I wrong about that? I don't know. And now, I'm afraid to flirt. What next? I won't look at a beautiful woman? Back then, I would've hit on you. I would've been naughty, or sneaky, as Ludovic would say. But at least it would've created erotic tension... I don't feel free to say what I want anymore. I wouldn't have been indecent. But I would've said "I want to make love to you." -And you don't dare? - I don't. Deep down, maybe you don't want to. I mean, you have less... The thing is, I'm starting to want it less. Sorry to be explicit, but some of my friends have stopped masturbating. And sometimes l force myself, to keep masturbating. You're afraid of growing old. -You're afraid of death. - I don't give a shit. That's What it sounds like. When I jerk off, I get in trouble. What can I do? I've been doing porno for 25 years, I won't change. I mean, I'll change but... Why do you get in trouble when you jerk off? I don't know anymore. When I step outside, I'm afraid of my true self. And when I go home, I masturbate to calm down. But I get in trouble, because she found out I jerk off to muscular women and old ladies. When she got home, I told her, and that was a big step for me, I told her l was masturbating. But I told her I was looking at "beautiful women". Because if she'd caught me masturbating to trannies, I'd be too ashamed. In my own house, I should be able to tell my wife I like trannies. But the Misses doesn't want me to have fantasies about trannies. What the fuck am I supposed to do? Own up to it. Yeah, own up to it. At What price? It's not that easy. - Were you happier before? - Relationships aren't easy. I was happier, life was easier. I think I could be happy but I have to change. When I look at my parents or listen to most people's advice, when I look at their intellectual and emotional life, I don't envy them. Do you think questioning everything is the key to happiness? No, I talk too much. Fuck you. Sorry, I didn't mean that. In all your kindness and sympathy, tell me to go home to my family. You can't tear yourself away? It's been a long day and I happen to be with the only guy Who just woke up. And since I'm not into after-parties... Yeah. What can you say to make me go? Maybe that's why I came here. What should I do to go home? But you only just woke up. No, I'm trying to... I'm walking in the kids' room, I'm pushing the door... I'm holding the bottle. I'm going to check on the sister. I have to change the diaper. It stinks. I'm dressing them. - Here are the kids. -You're done? Look, they're all dressed. It's time to go home then. -You have to take them back. - Okay. - Take the piano road. -I'm holding their hand. I'll take the piano road and then walk them to school. Okay. I slept two hours but I feel great. You're lucky. How did it go? Good, I told you. What? Stop interrogating me, darling. I'm asking how your film went, it was the first day. Well, the first day... The film crew is great. I'm well-surrounded. No one bothered me. - The car was well-lit. -You came home late. Ludovic did a fantastic job. - Hervé, you came home late. - Yes. That's part of the job. And Karina? Karina is sublime. Why are you obsessed about Karina? - Because she's my friend. - So What? I want to know how she did, as an actress. - She's good. - She's good? You're happy? I'm happy. Then again, she's well-directed. What are the lights in the apartment for? It was supposed to be a test. I'm not dumb enough to think you're... I'm still doing tests. The lights are staying. I'm the head of this family. Damn it. - Don't swear in front of the kids. - Sorry, kids. You're acting weird. I'm telling you. It's strange, you're not yourself. Well... I don't know. Whatever you're trying to do, it's not working. You're not being yourself. - It's like you're an actor. -I am an actor. But we're home. Why are you playing pretend? Act normal. I'm a bad actor? Yes, if you were in a film, I'd say you're a terrible actor You're weird. Maybe I was a bad actor yesterday. I don't know, I wasn't there. But you're being weird. You seem well. No, I'm tired. I heard you come in last night. We'll have breakfast after we drop the kids off. We're already late. No, stop Hervé! I'm tired. Enora? Tell her to stop playing with the light. Enora! You're not having breakfast? I'll have one later. Have you seen the time? Don't you want to have a sexy shower? - What? -A sexy shower. Who's going to watch the kids during the sexy shower? You say things that make no sense. You have kids. Enora, stop! Leave your little brother alone. You're impossible. Don't tell me it's great. Thierry, what else do you want me to say? We're going to have a normal conversation. You were the one who came to see me. Everything is in place, you can't stop now. I don't give a damn about the hired actors. I'm not making a film to make them happy. Listen to yourself. Okay now, tell me how we can make a film. Tell me. I don't know what I want to do. But I've made the right decision. For myself, anyway. OK, let's just leave it at that. I'm done with you. You'll give me back my money and apologize to everyone. -You're going to call everybody. - I'm not going to... I won't call them. - I won't. - That's What you call being brave? Okay, listen. Don't lecture me please, Thierry. I'm not lecturing you. I don't care about you anymore. I think... But don't forget to call everyone and to give me back my money. "Frustrated with the film industry, "he decides to pursue filming on his own terms, as a documentary." Yeah. - That's what you're going to do? - Yeah. - It's what we're doing now. - Okay. So what now? I want to see how far I can take the humiliation. What humiliation? I don't need to be comforted by a 20 year-old I'm 47. That's ridiculous. - You're 47? - Yeah. Well... You don't look 47. I'm 23. I could be your daughter. - 23, what? - 23 years old. - That's my party joke. - It's a good one. - You think it's funny? - It's great. -Really? -No. It's bad? I don't know how to flirt. Are you trying to have sex with me? You've been on my back for six months about the film, and now you're stripping? Once, I did that with a girl I didn't know, I thought it was in the bag and she said "what are you doing?" I felt like such a dumb-ass. I've never done that. - Go on then, do it. -No. No, I'm not hitting on you. It's bizarre, and I'm surprised, beacse usually, walking in here, I would've thought about it. I'd imagined the scene. What pisses me off is that I don't want to hit on you. I don't want to make a big deal, but I hadn't thought about sex before you mentioned it. See, actually, I spend my time working with 20 year-old girls, and each one could be my daughter. That sounds weird. Why don't you work in porn? That's a good question. You know, you have to start somewhere. I'd like to work on a scene, as if I wrote a film for you... and it's only fiction, Lydia. Okay. You find out that your daddy makes porn films. Go, action. - No, that's stupid. - Why? I can't imagine that kind of situation. You've come to a casting call, and you see your daddy with a hard-on. Yeah, I get what you're saying. But I can't imagine because it's never happened to me. I don't even want to imagine, it must be horrible. -Ah, you see? -Yes, I'm telling you. Oh shit... I don't really know you, but if my daughter becomes like you when she's 23, maybe that'll make me happy. I said maybe. Maybe, yeah. To me, you embody happiness for the future. Especially because my girlfriend says she used to be a prostitute and she's living with one. She's looking for her dark side. And I think "shit, maybe our kids will follow that path." Because their parents are so complex. And... I forgot what I was saying. You're afraid your daughter will become a hooker. If you put it that way, yes! -Yeah! -I don't know... Well... I don't believe in curses. But shit, maybe we'll become... Maybe being Whores will be our family tradition. I'm a singer and my father is a singer. Some butchers have butcher fathers. Some bakers have baker fathers. And some hookers... Well, yeah... - She could become an architect! -Ah, that's better! I want her to become an architect damn it! Shit. Let's do it. Let's go. Come on. Let's sit like this. Look, isn't that funny? I'm starting to understand how to make a good picture. Oh, I'm sorry. Daddy is funny. Isn't daddy funny? Stay there. Stay there, sweetie. Be careful. You know, when mom gets home, we'll be in trouble. I don't even know if it's recording. Stay there, sweetie. Wait, I'll be right back. Karina? I brought you something. Take a look and tell me What you think. It's a list, my friend. The beginning is missing, it starts at number 858. He used to have a green notebook, with all the girls from number 1 to number 857, and I threw it away. That's all there's left. "Number 864, Céline. "November 13th, 2000. "Picked up on the Republic square. "I told her we could make love and gave her my number. "Four months later, she found my number again. "We met up and made love an hour later. "She sucks off very well. Beautiful brunette. "Tight body, small firm breasts, pretty girl. "Knows how to make a man come. "Another good day." You see, Hervé told me something. Keep reading. He told me he wasn't looking for beautiful women, but fresh meat. Fresh meat. 70 year-old grandmothers, obese women, or transsexuals who still have a penis. Fresh meat. And I have to get past that. Sometimes, I tell myself, I'm not obsessed with it, but sometimes I want... I'd like to poor bleach on his dick, to clean it, knowing where it's been... I swear, Karina, I think... How do you get past that? Imagine your man in a porn scene and then making love to you. You're deranged. I've never seen anything like this. Why are you showing her, Gwen? I want to show her a pan of you. We know your penis but not what you do with it. You're an artist. You write very interesting things. What does it feel like to be with a guy who makes lists? Actually, look closer. I'm on there. What number are you? - I'm farther down. -You're in capital letters. -Yeah... -Which number, Gwen? I don't remember. I'm the 1228th. You don't even remember, Hervé? "1228..." For our kids, the kids I have with Hervé, it's pretty trashy. Leni will think I'm an athlete. It'll be tougher for our daughter. What bothers me... Dad makes love and has a good life, it's great. I never wanted to be an astronaut. That's not the point, do you ever think about the kids? No, I focus on my work. And so what? There's no shame in having a porn dad. I'm not saying it's a fault. I took Leni to school... Sorry, what is "a bit of ketchup"? I don't know. - What does it mean? - Read it. - I'm worried. - Show me the page. I won't read the beginning: "The tip went in, a bit of ketchup and the scene was done" Does that ring a bell? It was in 2001. - It's too long ago. -I don't know! There's too much. Do you miss it? Tell me, do you miss having a wild life? No, I don't. Being with a different girl every day. Who would miss that? Are you kidding? What guy would miss that? Wait, wait... Isn't that what you were saying? Are you listening to him? He thinks every guy would want that kind of life. If you want to be single again, I'll let you have a few days. But just a few days, and then I'll leave. And you'll have time to think. You think... Here, it'll do you good. Oh, shit... You know how much you owe me? No, just that one. I'll pay you tomorrow, I don't want to rush. Have some more. You're making fun of me. - Why? - Be quiet. Come on, hurry up. It's not full enough. Okay, let's go. Silence! Hey... Kenn, go on, M's go. Don't look at me like that, it's disturbing. Kenza, please say something. Get hard. I feel so alone. - Well... - No, stay there. -Come on. Okay, do you want to try another position? I'm so embarrassed. My secret shame is that I don't have a big penis. Let's change positions. Lay down. Lay down, please. No, wait... Like that. Lay down like that. Come sit in front of me. I'm going to try a trick. Sorry. I'm going to stand next to a pole. I used to do that as a kid. "In ten, it'll be up to me." One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Eight... Damn it! I have to accept it. It's not your fault. Can you take your underwear off? Are you doing your scene or just faking it? Well, let's fake the ejaculation. Since we've already worked together, I'll make a cut with a dick shot from a previous scene. All right? Let's go. It's a little chilly. -Want a taste? - No thanks. Shit... Call me if you ever have ejaculations like that. Ludo, help me out. Go sit facing... Sit here. Look, your face should be... Come here, please. Come closer. You have to be behind that. No, you have to stand up. Start moving. Tell me... Shit... I know it's pathetic, but you're an actress, pretend it's huge and it's about to shoot. I'm sorry, it's stupid. I can't. This is stupid. I've never been this bad. Watch out, it's dripping on her stokings. Okay, now it's getting... Enora? Who drew on this child's face? Who drew on Leni? It wasn't me, it was Little Brown Bear. And who did that, on the floor? Not me. All right. Daddy, you have no hair. You want to know if you could do it. You're inviting a cougar and a young guy, to see if it turns you on. Action! Hello. I have a fantasy. I'd like to see a young guy getting jumped by a cougar. I'm too scared to do it myself. That's why I made them come over, to see in could do it myself... If I could jump... jump into action. Keep going. Damn! Could you sodomize... Did you sodomize him? Yeah. You want to sodomize him? Yeah. Why would I leave this world? Okay, I'm filming. Girls, watch that with passion. You're turned on by two guys sodomizing. For the positions, I'd like you to lay here. And you'll sit on him. Okay? Let's start shooting. I want to watch two men screwing to see how it makes me feel. I'm really curious. What about you? You want to watch? I do. Really? I'm making a film. A documentary, to help me get closer to my wife. But we're losing each other. It's the straw that broke the camel's back. I'm not ordinarily like this.. I'm worse than ever. Can you poor me some vodka? - It's no good... - Did you mix it with juice? It's no good. I'm losing my wife. Okay, let's go. Here we are. It's Christmas, Marité. Marité, it's Christmas! It's Christmas! Aunty is here! Squeeze his dick. - How? - Squeeze it like that. Use his legs like that. - How was it? - Great. Sorry. It was great. Cut the lights. I'm going to take soft photos. And then we'll be done. Marie, I looked for photos of you from when you were younger, but I didn't find any. I don't have them anymore. You told me you were a model. I was, but I never kept the photos. I was a model, yes. But I lost all the photos. What? I lost them all, I moved. My family threw them away or I did. No, I left them with my family and I never see them anymore. I don't even know Where they live. Anyway, I didn't have photos from when I was very young. I was about thirty... That's pretty young. How old are you? -I looked young but... - Can you tell us your age? I'm fifty years old. I don't give my real age, so there's no use asking. I like to have a good time, sol never give my age. It bothers and baffles people. You, you're really good. I love it. I always give my best. Have you ever been spotted? Do people recognize you? Yeah, sometimes when I'm out on the scene. What do your parents say? My parents don't know. My brothers know but not my parents. Your brothers saw you online? Yeah, they found me on the internet. Your parents will find out sooner or later. Yeah, but I don't care. It's my life. I can tell you why, it's because I love the films I make. Whether it's pornos, or other things I could make. It's always cinema. The sex act isn't important? Well, it's part of it. Even if you don't think it is, it's part of it. I give my best. Whatever l do, I give it my best. Not everyone is like you. Most people couldn't do what you do. It's because you love theatre. I love to act. Joel, you know I'm a father. I have a little girl, her name is Enora. And a little guy, Leni. I saw them. Your wife wrote me online. -I have three but... - So you wanted kids. - No, no... - You have kids. I had kids because l was stupid. And in had to do it again, I wouldn't. Knowing how they turned out. But you wanted kids. I wanted kids, but now l regret it. I see. That can happen. But you wanted them. I did but... When you don't want kids, that's a problem. And you can regret it later. That's true. I regret it because they're here, and it's my responsibility. There's no doubt about it. Not sentimentally, because they're not nice. Some kids are nice. I wasn't lucky to have nice kids. Because of what you do? No, not at all. - That's just how they are? - Yes. They don't know What I do for a living. They never knew about my job. But they're not nice, that's it. You help your kids out, even when they're 36, and you get nothing in return... You worry about them, about everything, including money. Money, because it's a problem. You try to find them a job but you're disappointed in the end. You never get kisses, you don't get anything. No phone calls asking: "how are you, mom?" Honestly, I understand people who regret having kids. Now, I understand. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have kids. I think you can enjoy life without having kids. It's like the lottery. Leave her alone! Leave her alone. You're together because... That's right, we met thanks to you. - That's true. - Yeah. I'm not sure I should thank you. Honestly... Why do you say that? I am What I am. I've always been like this, but we're not happy anymore. I haven't changed, I'm still the same guy. I'm as much of an idiot. That's my strength, I'm an idiot. Do you need help? I love watching you pop a cork. I only drink whiskey. Obviously, it's not Saturday night. I'm off Saturdays. - Really? -I can't anymore. - Seriously? - Yeah. I was... - Hervé? -Yes, darling? - I'm coming. - Let's go. What did you draw Look at that. Look at the drawing. Is it Enora? Enora, do you want your bottle or not? Enora, are you going to drink your bottle or not? - No wine for me tonight. - Seriously? This gentleman has a hangover, that's why he's in his robe. - Really? - Yeah. - You went out? - No. -Ready? -I didn't go out. Yeah right. I want to thank you for being here. Now, let's have a good time. I want a cola. Go get it. - It's for me. -You want a cola? If you want wine, I'll poor you some. - White wine? -You know us. - Herve, can you cut the meat. -I can do it if you want. -I'll do it. -You should get a fork. - Leave me alone, please. - It's a mission. I know you. You have a brother named Leni. Can you cut White meat for Leni? A small piece. Wait, look at what you're doing. Look at yourself. I don't care. Being hung over doesn't give you the right to act like a pig. Look at yourself. And look at us. You want to train me in front of your friends? I'm not training you. You're not a dog. You haven't seen me at work. No, that's stupid. But stop bugging me. Leni, you're going to bed. You're sleepy. Nino? Hervé, please. Hervé stop! He's starving. Hervé stop, I'm serious! It's okay! Who is this guy eating like a pig and being a bad host. This dinner is a disaster. Hey, Leni. You're embarrassing me. Is your son allowed to drink wine? I thought you were talking about me. Sorry! I'd prefer that Hervé went out instead of acting like this. You went out last night? What is it, Enora? Come to mommy. Something wrong? It's been tough, lately. Yeah? Tell us about it. There's nothing to say. Look for your dummy. Where is it? I'm going to put them to bed. Please do. The little one is... Look Hervé. Can I speak to you? Wash your hands first please. Have you gone mad? You're insane, Hervé. Go wash your hands, please. You're lucky I didn't throw that to your face. Go over there, please. Hurry up. - Look at What you've done. - So What? I don't give a shit. This is ridiculous. The dinner... You ruined dinner. You humiliated me in front of them. You went too far. - Nino, calm down. -Nino. Come back here, right away! Hurry up. Go back there. Go back there, please. Stop drinking. Don't slap me. What? You're kidding! - Get out. - Stop! Stop it! Daddy left. Should I cover the holes? Where's my camera? Hey, did you see my camera? Shit, Hervé. Stop it, seriously. This paint job is starting to get on my nerves. I want to help out, but every time... Okay. I don't know Where you put it. Just stars or do you want comets? How about a flying star. Yeah. Couldn't be uglier. I don't think it's ugly. You hardly ever get to work on big-budget films like this. That's for sure. -Are you happy to be here, Nina? -Yeah. William? We haven't worked together in a While. It's been ages, yeah. A few years, actually. I first introduced you, I think. You met thanks to me. That's true. -I produced the first scene. - Yeah. Is that good or bad? Hervé gave me my first job, yeah. That's true. I remember our first scene together very well. I remember your first anal, too. He was very nice. -Yeah? That was a while ago. -You're a jerk. Go for it. It was a while ago, yeah. Thank you. Let's get started. Take small steps to make the background look big. And look around. It took us two hours to paint this, we're going to show it. Two hours. So look around. "Oh, a pine tree! "Oh another pine tree." Make the most of the set. And then you... And then he puts down his bag... And then, you light a fire. And that's when... That's when Nina delivers her notorious line. We'll have to turn that off, if we don't light a fire. It's just a light. - Now it's on. - But it doesn't stay lit. Okay, let's just do it. Okay, I'm going in the tent. Let's go. Silence! Set number one. Camera. Action. Shit! I don't have matches! Damn it! I can turn you on, if you want. -You want to warm me up? -Yeah! - Don't you want to go inside? - No, no... -Why not? - I'm here, I'm cold too. My ass is cold. -You're in it? - Yeah. - It's a point-of-view shot? - Didn't I tell you? It's a threesome, with a double penetration. Shit. Okay, fine. - Let's just do it. - It's a point-of-view scene? - Okay, I see. - Do we shoot here? Let's pick it up when you step out. I forgot to tell you I was in it. I can turn you on, if you want. YES, come warm me up. It's so cold. It is. Hi there. You can warm us both. Wow, two? Two yodelers. That's right, you're hot. That bird is getting on my nerves, go away! Oh yeah... - It's so hot under your skirt. - Yeah. Thank you. They're great. Come on. Come and heat my wood. Here, take both at the same time. Unzip this. Put your hand there. Oh yeah, your mouth is huge. I'd like some wood too. Oh yeah! Hey! That's enough. William, put your dick away. Just do as I tell you. Put your click away. -What are you doing here? - Nice to meet you. Get up. Guys, this is my wife. What are you doing here? How's it going, Gwen? What is this? Oh Gwen, the famous Gwen? - Yeah. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Wait, it's not a family film. Gwen, what are you doing here? Why do you think I came dressed up as a yodeler? -You're kidding. -No. We don't shoot family films. - Gwen, stop messing with me. - Stop, Hervé. It wasn't planned? She's my wife. Put your dick away! Okay. Calm down, Hervé. -I mean... -I'm sorry. You think he's going to put his thing in your mouth? Why not? Why can't I do a double? Gwen, that's not... Listen, Hervé. You've never been on a set in 20 years. 20 years? I couldn't... Why? Oh right, never mind. She's 27. I'm an idiot. I understand, Hervé. I wouldn't want my wife in a film either. It's a job. I keep my personal life separate. You don't want to go home to a porn actress. Don't you want to sit around this nice fire? What does your wife do? She used to be an actress. I'm an open-minded kind of guy. But look at us. We're eating marshmallows instead of... So What? Have it your way. What do I do? -Should I stay? Should I go? -You can stay. - I'm allowed to stay? - Of course. Hervé, that's sweet. But I'm here for a job. If you're being paid, you can stay. I'd rather talk than get fucked in the ass. Sure! I'll pay you for the job and you can stay to talk with her. Maybe I'll only pay half of your salary. If you want to make money, keep your dick away and talk. Keep your dick in your pants, okay? Why can't he take it out? We've already talked about it. I don't want my wife in a porno. Maybe I'm old fashioned. Not my wife and not my daughter. Thank goodness. Leni, I don't give a shit. Ah, macho! -I'm not being macho. -Leni is our son. Leni can be a porn actor. I can't and neither can Enora, because we're women. I don't like the idea that my kids will watch this. And that one day, my daughter will say: "You never told me dad makes pornos." For a girl, it'll be tough but not for a boy. I'm not sure. My son knows. He told me recently that he watches porn. - 12 year-old kids! - Of course. What's? When he told me, I didn't make a big deal out of it. I talked about it calmly. I told him: "It's fiction, it's not real. "And I don't want you to educate yourself with porn, "because it's not what sex is about. "I'd rather you learned slowly with your girlfriends." And I also told him: "it's my job and I don't want you to find one of my videos. "You can watch porn when you're 16, 17 or 18 years old. "It's not a big deal if you've watched a few. "But I'd rather you didn't anymore." Why would he quit now? Of course, he didn't quit. - I never stopped. -Of course, and all kids do it. But I warned him it was my job. You trust him not to watch porn again? I think he still watches porn. I don't know if he's seen one of my films. I didn't want him to be surprised, so I warned him. And I didn't play the victim. I told him it was a job and I made a lot of money. I traveled here and there. I saw this and did that, etc. I didn't tell him: "Your dad beat me up, I ms on the street "and I had to sell my ass to survive." I made it sound nicer. Gwen, that's enough. Did you get the answers you were looking for? No. I think I'm going to quit. I've had enough. I've done it all. I've been doing this for a While. I need a change. Maybe the kind of life that Gwen is offering Hervé. To take better care of my kid. That kind of life. - I think I'm going to go. - I'll go with you. Yeah, I think we've said it all. Let's go before the set falls on our heads. That's sweet of you, but what about us? Hervé? -Come on. - Never mind, William. We're still getting paid, don't worry. I'm not worried. Nina? William, don't forget your shirt. It's not mine, it's Hervé's. Have fun in your landscape. Yeah... -We spent hours on the painting... - Don't start. It pisses me off. It all fell apart. Mountains are solid. When you're on top, you have to hang in there. Shit... Let me look to the horizon in peace. You okay, sweetie? Sing me a song, Enora. Yes. The song you learned in school. Yes. Three Blind Mice. Come on. Gimme Shelter. Come on. Three Blind Mice. Come on, Enora. Sing. Please, it'll make me happy. - Sing for mummy. -No. Why not? You know Why we'll keep loving each other? Because nothing will change.
