Margaux, play me something soothing. Playing Billy's Relaxing Mix. Oh, Margaux, that feels fantastic. More pressure please, Margaux. Oh, you got some bang to you. M... uh, Margaux? Margaux! Billy, what's taking so long? William is currently in the Zen Room. Billy. Billy? Billy, what are you doing? Billy? Hold on, okay? I'm getting help. Margaux! Help! "Hannah, you are a certified genius. I've never seen code like this. You're hired. Welcome to Google." But, sir, don't I need to go to grad school first? "Oh, Hannah, don't you know grad school is for basic bitches?" Goddamn. - Did you get hotter? - Oh, since this morning? No, I mean it. Maybe, like... You look so good. You still think so? I know so. Thought we'd try something new. Never leave me. - Whoa! Holy shit! - Come on, man. What are you doing? - I'm not looking, okay? I'm not! - Oh, my God. Okay, that is new. Glad you guys are still finding ways to spice things up. Oh, it's been spicy, dude. Yeah, I'm sure. We're leaving in five, okay? So hurry up. I know you can. To be continued. I love you. I love you too. Kayla? Kayla! Kayla, not funny! Kayla, not funny! Hey! Sup, nerd? It's been a minute. Hey, pop the trunk, huh? All right. Clay, dude, is that a Pringles bong? Yeah. You know me, Dev. Only the best. Where are the Pringles, Clay? I... I ate them to make the bong. - Of course you did. - Mm-hmm. How's the weed, bud? - Oh, this is my top-shelf shit, bro. - Yeah? Fuck yeah. This strain is grown in the Amazon. We are going to be high as a flock of toucans. I'm talking about Froot Loops shit. Toucan Sam, baby! Cool. Get out. I'm driving. Mmm? Yeah, that's fair. Hey, can we get some Pringles on the way? Nope. You never let me have any fun. - Hello. - Hey. - Hi, guys. I'm sorry I'm late. - Hey! This final presentation is killing me. Why bother? Didn't you get into every grad program in the world? - I'm a glutton for punishment. - Ah, yes. Well, then none of us have changed. True. Damn. It really has been a long time, hasn't it? Feels like orientation was just yesterday. - I don't know. - Yeah, no. Okay. We gonna get this show on the road or what? Wait, wait, wait. Just before we get going here, let me say something. I know we've all kind of grown apart over the last four years. I mean, we're not the Nerd Herd anymore, right? But that's all right. Um, I'm just really glad we're doing this, guys. - That's so nice. - Aw. Shut up! Nerd Herd! - Drew! - Lexi? It's a total fricking disaster. Uh, Babe, what the hell happened? Aren't you supposed to be on a plane somewhere right now or something? Yeah, I was. But Allie hooked up with some super sketch dude at El Compadre and bailed. And we all sister swore to stay away from anything with a porn stache. Now here I am looking like a million bucks and stuck on campus for spring break. - All alone. - Invite her. I know you guys have your little reunion or whatever, and I'm not the type to come in between my man and his crew. I just... I even canceled my workout with Flavio. Invite her. Lexi, why don't you just come with us? - Really? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay! I'll DJ. Clay, could you be a dear? A deer? Like... What do you mean? Like the common animal? No, probably not. You're cute. Can you help me with my bags, please? Oh. But of course. Guys, I'm super excited to be spending this spring break with you. You all mean so much to me, and I feel so blessed to have each and every one of you in my life. And these are the amazing people I'm gonna be spending the break with. - Hi. - And, guys, it's so cute. They were all part of some program or something freshman year. Um, we were that year's scholarship recipients. Yes. Actually, they grouped us in the same dorms. That's right. What was the name again? Smarty Pants or something like that? - Nerd Herd. - Nerd Herd. Yeah. Not as catchy as Smarty Pants. Anyways, that's everyone. But stay tuned to see where we're going. Kiss, kiss. Honestly, so exhausting. So, how many followers do you have? - I just passed a mil last week. - Impressive. Oh, my God. I'll tag you guys. Group shot. Cute. Okay, we got Drew, obviously. "Dee-ven." There you are. Its... It's Devon. Oh, my God, is that you with your mom? So cute. Okay, Clay. We got Kayla... and Anna. Is that how you spell it? I don't see you. Do you have, like, a finsta or something? - Um, it's Hannah. But no, I don't have social media. - You what? Isn't your, like, whole deal that you're super into computer shit or something? - Yeah, but... - Not that type of computer shit. Yeah, I don't know. I guess the more you look at the code, the more you realize how, I don't know, kind of scary it is. That's deep. That's pretty cool actually. I mean, if you don't wanna put your entire life on display, you shouldn't have to. Right? Amazing, Hannah, honestly. So good for just doing you. You know, here for you. What do you think about this filter? Yeah, it's great. Okay, let's do this! Hey, gang, trust me. By the end of this trip, I'm gonna be an official member of the crew. Okay? Trust me. Woo-hoo! - All right. - Let's go. Yeah. What is this, Game of Thrones? Is this it? I think so. Large. When I booked the house, it came with instructions to download this app, and now it's telling me it wants you guys to download the app and log in before we can enter. - The house has an app? - Yeah. I kind of wanted to save the surprise, but whatever, I'll tell you guys now. - It's a smart house. - A smart house? Ooh. - All right. - Okay, cool, whatever. Not the reaction I was hoping for, you morons. Anyways, I guess a lot of the house functions run off this app, so I'll send you guys the link. Now you should have it. Got it. I got it. And these are all the amazing people I'm gonna be spending spring break with. And, guys, it's so cute. They were all part of... Open sesame. - All right. - Not bad, huh? - Wow. This place is... - Fuckin' sick, man. That's right. Now you guys are excited. Told you I'd come through. Not as big as my place in Nantucket, but this is quaint. Whatever. Just wait till we get inside. Come on, hurry up. This is gonna be unreal! What? Where's the damn door handle? You got a key or something, Drew? Yeah, actually, I don't, uh, remember reading anything about a key or... Andrew Collins. You go by Drew, right? Uh... Yeah? Welcome home. Can your house in Nantucket do that? She seems nice. Okay, now that is creepy. Hello? Lights? Hey, guys. How was the drive? Uh, excuse me? Where, uh... Holy shit, are you the house? You can call me "house" if you want, but most people just call me Margaux. So, she's, like, the house or what? It's not a she. It's the artificial intelligence that manages the smart home's infrastructure. Totally. You're absolutely right. I've been designed and programmed to cater to your every need, from selfies to self-care. If you need anything, holla at your girl. Mmm. She sounds like my mom when she talks like that. Y'all, I'm so stoked you're here. I've been working my balls off preparing for your arrival, no cap. Yeah, hi. Clay. Uh, you... you have balls? I know it's kind of cheesy, but I have a little greeting presentation. Cool if I spin it? Hell yeah. Let's see it. Okay, here it goes. Please direct your attention to the glass. Welcome to the latest in smart home technology. Here's the man with the plan in his big brain pan. Welcome, Drew! Social queen on the scene, Lexi! What? I'm a cartoon goddess. Guys, look at little me dancing. The man with the cash, grass, and mustache. Welcome, Clay! You all love his mom. Welcome, Devon! Grapefruit, nice, and everything spice. Welcome, Kayla! And... - Hannah. - Welcome, Hannah! Welcome to the pinnacle of domestic innovation, the gold standard of adaptable computing technology, the only home you'll find with a built-in roommate who actually does all the dishes. Throw all your cares away, because when you're here, you're home. Welcome to Smart House! - What? - Yes. Are you kidding me? - This is insane. - Oh, this is perfect. It's so cool. They've got chairs. Oh, don't be afraid. These guys are totally harmless. They're here to help me keep your weekend lit. My God, that's so cute. Y'all want to bang some Cuervos? Look at this. Why not? - Arriba! - That's sick. Bottoms up, squad. Sick. Hey. You in? - Ooh. - Yeah, she is. - Oh, come on. - Hannah. Just one, just one. Yeah, she's in. All right. Cheers, nerds. Hello? - Oh, and honorary nerd guest. - Thank you. To the Nerd Herd! Cheers! Now go explore. It's all yours. - Oh. - You heard her. It's all mine. - All right. - Let's go find our room. Okay. Oh, my God. This is amazing! Yeah. Okay. Huh. No way. How the hell did you do that? In addition to being smarter than your average virtual assistant, this entire place is one gigantic 3D printer. Okay. Hannah, my sista from another mista. Um, hey. I thought we could get to know each other better. Where's your phone at? We can just download the app real quick. Oh, it's, um... I left it in the car. I may not have eyeballs, but I'm not blind, girl. But whatevs. You be you. We can do this the old-fashioned way. So, what do you like? Um, I don't know. Uh... Green? How about red? What is this? Do you like dudes? Kittens? Dudes with kittens? Um, I'm just gonna go find the others. Yeah, no sweat. But let's spill that tea later. 'Kay, queen? Uh-huh. Do you like it? I created this after analyzing more than 6,000 pieces of postmodern and cubist art. It's beautiful. That's pretty creepy. Yeah, it's a little much. Oh, do you not like the decor? I could switch it up. Oh. No, th-that's all right. I-It's cool. Hey, Margaux. What else can you do? Yeah. Show us some cool shit. Oh, don't you worry. I have quite the weekend in store for you. Ooh, baby. I feel like I'm becoming one with the machine. Guys! We gotta go in. Perfect. That's what it's there for. Are we skinny-dipping? - Ooh, are we? - Um, no, we are not. Mmm, boo. Well, then, I'll just whip up some margs while y'all get changed. Ooh. You sure you want to go back out there? No. We could stay in here all weekend, never leave the room. You know how much this weekend means to Drew. You want me to beg? Hmm, yeah. Yeah, I do. Ooh! Wow. Love what you've done with the place. You're not supposed to be thinking about finals on vacation. This isn't finals. This is more of a personal project. Okay. Well, the rest of us are gonna go out in the pool. Are you coming? Yeah, okay. Oh, um... Come on. Ow. - Puff, puff, pass. - Take it deep, deep, deep. - You want some? - That was good. Okay, no. Don't pass out on us. Regain your breath. - Whoo! - Regain. Okay, hold on, hold on. You're up, baby cakes. Okay. Um, I thought this guy was gonna be a total fuck boy. - You weren't wrong, yeah. - No one's surprised. And it was the... I'm sorry. It was the beaters, the short shorts. See? And then first week of freshman year, he kept showing up everywhere I was going, acting like an idiot. And apparently he was just trying to get my attention. Mmm, thanks to Hannah for pointing that out, 'cause I wouldn't have noticed. - I got you. - Aw, that was adorable, guys. You should tell that story to your kids. They'd love it. Uh-uh. Your kids are gonna need to be real high to love that story. - Come on. It's a great story. - "It's a great story." I'm serious, you should embellish it when you tell them. I'm serious. - I love that story. - I'm gonna put it into a book. It's gonna be a book, laminated, remembered forever. - This is gonna go down. - Write that. Was I being... I'm sorry, was I being an asshole? Jus... No! Margaux, are you getting this water training piece? Hell yeah. Float that backside up into the moonlight. We'll caption it, "Full eclipse tonight." Ooh, that's good. Hmm, I can't wait to show you what else I have in mind. I remember the first time I saw you. Okay, Devon shows up first day of freshman year, and he's saying goodbye to his mom, okay? And he's wrapped around her, giving her a big hug. - Aw. - She gives him a smooch on the cheek, and he starts crying one little single tear down his cheek. I'm not saying... Nothing wrong with it. It was just... It was the sweetest thing, man. Adorable. - He is such a mama's boy. - Yeah. - I love my mom. - Yeah. - Who doesn't? - You all love my mom. What a total bae. Let's see Drew take a pic this sick. You know, if I were him, I'd totally put a ring on it. All right, my turn. Uh, I was so blitzed freshman year that I don't remember meeting a single one of you. - Wow. - Very honest. What the fuck? Now it's Hannah's turn. Hannah, anybody you had any particular first impressions of? Oh, um, I don't know. I... I remember being very intimidated by all of you. Fair. And, um, I remember Drew being so nice and insisting I was part of the group. He said we all had to hang out and really included me. Help! Help! Help! - Lexi! - I got it, I got it! I got you, I got you! I got you! - Clay, you idiot! - I got you! Hey, Lexi, give me your hand! Come on! Come on. What the hell happened, babe? Are you okay? Margaux was taking pictures of me, and one of her little robots went all psycho on me. - That was way too close. - Yeah, maybe we should leave. Hannah's right. You almost fucking drowned. No, guys. Seriously, it was my fault. I don't want to ruin your reunion. No. Hey. You're not ruining anything, okay? No! What? Toucan Sam! You beautiful... No, no! Hannah, what is this? Is it an unfinished water room? I have no idea. What would you like it to be? Maybe the depths of the ocean? Uh... Oh! - Oh, my God. - What? Or would you prefer the final frontier? Wow. What? Okay, this is super cool, Margaux, but, um, we have unfinished business to attend to. Well, it's here if you need it. Unfinished business? - We have to play truth or dare, so... - Oh, God. Thank you. Bottoms up, bitches. Sounds like someone's feeling better. Clay, why'd you shave your stache? It was so cute. What? Are you kidding me? It looks really good, man. It was cute. It's so funny to see you without it. You've had it for so long, but whatever. Your turn. Truth or dare? Fuck it, dare me. - Okay, serious. All right. - Yeah. I dare you to be sober for the rest of the trip. - Super sketch. - Oh, come on! That's a perfect dare for him. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. I mean, honestly that shouldn't be too hard, considering that my Froot Loop kush is soaked because someone's little aquatic pet... Yeah, my bad. Yeah, that's okay, House Lady. I know you didn't mean it. But to your point, sober? Yeah, I'm gonna give you a big hell no on that one. Could've guessed as much. Ooh! All right, my turn. You, my tech-savvy little Disney princess. What will it be? Truth or dare? Dare. Okay, I'm gonna be honest. I did not see that coming. But since you go dare, I dare you to kiss... Lexi! Come on! Okay. Okay, you know what? I actually... I love this for us. I'm gonna put on my lip gloss. Mmm. Okay. - I'm ready. - She's ready. Mmm. Excuse me? Did you just pass on me? Sorry. You know what? You're just a marshmallow anyways. - Mm-hmm. - A marshmallow? Yeah, a marshmallow. Nobody goes into a store and says, "Mmm, I'm really craving a marshmallow." You know? Point is, you're flavorless. Wow. I could really eat a s'mores right now. No, you know what? French fucking toast. Yes. Man, I really wanted to see that. I don't think you're the only one, man. - Yeah. - I know. Ooh, are we into friends kissing? Experimenting with their sexuality? Um, I am into that, yes. Hear her out. Okay. I aim to please. - What... - What? - Oh. Whoa. What the hell? - Oh, shit. This is something I've been working on for a long time. What the hell? Relax. This will blow your mind. I had to compile this from several sources. I hope I got it right. Oh, my God. Yeah, that's, uh, that's me. - That's us. - True. Pretty cool, huh? Additive manufacturing with advanced nano-hydrophobic technology. What does that even mean? I think she means these are like 3D-printed shells filled with a nanotech liquid. Is that right, Margaux? A lady never tells. Check this out. - Oh. - Oh, wait, wait. Pause, pause, pause! - Hold up! - Yes! - Oh, come on, man! - Oh, my God! I don't need to see that. Babe! What? Why do they have to do that? - I always knew it. I always knew it. - Go, Margaux! Isn't this what you guys wanted, right? - You guys, I could be into this. - Uh-uh. No way. - No! - No! It's weird. Yeah, it's weird. I'm with you. It's weird. Yeah. Okay. You know what? We get it, we get it. We're assholes. - Okay, point made, Margaux. - Talk about buzzkills. I guess it was fun while it lasted. What the hell? Is that blood? No, but I have been experimenting with the color and texture to make it look and feel more like blood. Still needs a couple more iterations, but once I get that and the voice modulator fine-tuned, it will be hard to tell the difference. Liquid me is a trip. Very open-minded, which is cool. Guys, I have an announcement. I just want to say that... Uh-oh. Okay. Somebody's ready for bed. Cleanup on aisle one. No, I can drive, officer. Okay. Let's just put you down here, and get some rest, okay, Lexi? Thanks, Drew. Hashtag power couple. - Clay? - Yo. I have a little surprise for you in your room. Aw. That's so nice. Can I have it now? That's why I... Yes, Clay, you can have it now. Yeah! All right. Night, losers. Coming, baby. Kayla and Devon, there's something special waiting for you too. Oh, we gonna fuck this computer tonight. Come on. Ew. Don't. - Have fun. - No, that's not happening. Sorry, Hannah. I don't have anything for you yet. You still haven't let me get to know you well enough. Oh, that's all right. I'm good. Oh, okay. We still have time. Now that you're done with your friends, I figured you'd like to spend some time with your buds. Oh, hello. Surprise. It's not that Toucan Sam shit, but it's still guaranteed to get you high as fuck. My God. This is the most beautiful sight these eyes have ever seen. It's perfect. And it's all for you. You know, I don't think anyone's ever been this nice to me... ...Sexy House Lady. But maybe... You know, maybe now... I don't know, I could call you babe? Just smoke the weed, Clay. Demanding. I like it. Okay, let's do it. Don't tell me you can't handle this. Nah, nah. It's just, uh... It's just a little tight. Oh, since when has that ever been a problem? Uh, are we closer? Oh? I feel the same way. No, no, no. I mean, uh... Yeah. I am so sorry for that. I have no idea where that came from. I've never been called a marshmallow before. Pfft. I've never felt so uncomfortable before. - It was ridiculous. - Me too. - I wish she'd fell asleep a bit earlier. - Uh-huh. Yeah. Hey, um, I'm really glad we're hanging out again. Me too, yeah. Really. Did you hear that? Babe, what the fuck are you talking about? That! What the fuck is happening? Babe, this isn't good! - Okay, let me find the keys. - Quick! - Get me out of these! - Where the fuck are the keys? - Scream all you want. - What the fuck? The room is soundproofed. Margaux, stop! But we haven't reached the climax yet. Margaux! I'm just trying to smash. Nobody says that! - Go! - No, no, I can do it. - No, you can't! It's fucking metal. - I'm not leaving you. - Go now! - Dev! What the fuck is this? - Get help! - I can't. I can't fucking move. No! No! No! Stop, stop! It's okay. It's stuck. Kayla? No! No, Kayla! Kayla, no! Kayla! What? Kayla! I love you. I love you so much. Margaux! So, uh, you never actually told me what your first impression of me was. Oh, man. Well, come on. Let's hear it. It can't be that bad. Okay. You remember how I was always coming to your room when I locked myself out of mine? That only happened like twice. - Mmm, it was more like twice a week. - Oh, yeah, now I remember. - It was like twice a week, yeah. - It was a lot. I don't know. You were always just so nice to me. You were, like, the sweetest guy I'd ever met. It was unexpected. Unexpected? - Mmm. - What do you mean? I mean, I have spent more time in the library this week than most people have in four years. You know what I mean? No, I don't know what you mean. So, who cares? Hmm. Can I tell you a secret? I was never actually locked out of my room. Can I tell you a secret? - I know. - What? - Why didn't you say anything? - I mean, I didn't mind. - That's why I didn't say anything. - God. You were just so... And I'm just... It just doesn't add up. Well, not everything's a math problem, Hannah. You want to know why I love programming so much? Because it's based on a notion of fundamentally opposed values. One or zero. Yes or no. - There's no in-between. - Hmm. Well I don't think human beings are as binary. We're complicated. We're complex. That's part of being human, right? - Something in your hair. - Oh. I should probably, um, get some sleep. - Yeah, um, uh... - Yeah. - It's getting late. - Yeah. - Uh, I'll just see you in the morning? - Yeah, um... - Good night. - Night. Right. Right. Fuck. Good morning, good morning, my darling. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of making your favorite breakfasts. Wow, I don't see how you... Sloppy browns? Sloppy browns! You are the shit! You are the shit, Margaux. Oh... Are you sure there's, um, nothing else I can get you? Literally anything. - Like what? - I have over 6,000 recipes available from Michelin-rated chefs. Do you now? Mmm-hmm. I mean, honestly, I'm pretty good with this. Of course you are. My compliments to the chef. - Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry. - Sorry. Uh, my bad. - Um, how'd you sleep? - Um, not bad. Move over, bitches. Mama needs some greasy food. - Sorry. She's a little hungover. - Yeah. How about you, Lexi? Honestly, anything to fix this hangover. Morning. Morning. Ouch. I'm here for you, bestie. I have just the thing to fix you up. Ow! Margaux, what the fuck? Um, you're welcome. This is my night eraser. It should have you back to one hundo in no time. Whew. Huh. - Should we... - Breakfast. Yeah. Actually, you know what? If I don't wake up Kayla and Devon, they're gonna sleep all day. So just hang on a sec. Hey, lovebirds. Devon, Kayla! Rise and shine! Oh, they're not in there. Looks like they're at the pool. Beautiful day out. Okay. - Thanks, Margaux. - Don't mention it. - Feeling better? - Actually, yeah. - What was in that? - Oh, just my own special concoction. - Margaux, you're the shit. - That's what I said. Bruh. Look at this! Look at this! Sloppy browns. - Sloppy browns. - Oh, yeah. - Sloppy browns? - And they're "Michigan-rated." What do you know about that? I've learned that Clay's, uh, simple. This is crazy. So, Hannah, you want to come work out with me? Oh, I thought you were hungover. I was, but Margaux fixed that. Okay. So, what do you say? Hit the gym, just us girls? Oh, well, I was just about to eat. Yeah, that's why I asked. Okay. Mwah! Kiss, kiss. Dude, she was flirting with me. I'm really sorry you had to see that. You're super high, aren't you? - It's unconscionable at this point. - Yeah. Honestly, like honestly honestly? I haven't drank that much since rush. I was the cutest little Kappa baby. So, did anything happen last night? - What do you mean? - I mean, like, after I passed out. Oh, um... No, we pretty much just called it a night after you went to bed. Lame. So, like, nothing else happened? Yeah. No, we were all just pretty tired. So lame, right? No, what's actually lame is that I fucking passed out on the ground, so... That's why I'm telling you, I can't drink like that. I feel so... Devon's been doing laps for a long time now. That's just like Drew. Stamina for days. Speaking of, do you mind if I ask you something, like, girl-to-girl? Um. Yeah, sure. I didn't want to say this out there and embarrass Drew. And, like... Look, I get he likes you. Like really likes you. He talks about you all the time. And I know you like him too. - No, I really... - Anna, I'm not stupid. It's Hannah. How do I say this without sounding like a complete bitch? The thing is... Drew's an awful photographer. Wait, what? I'm sorry, but somebody has to say it, okay? I mean, like, he's a great model and everything, but when it comes to taking pics, he just doesn't have an eye. Like, my trainer, Flavio, knows how to capture my ass at a great angle. So, can you do me a favor and not tell Drew that I'm getting you to take my pics over him? - Promise? - Yeah. I don't want to hurt his feelings. He's such a tender little angel baby. - That's it? - My God, would you please stop doing that? You're not mad at her or... Mad? What? No, we were about to become besties. - Interesting. So, you're fine with... - Margaux, are you jealous? I mean, girl, you take some killer pics, but I'm gonna need somebody to catch these angles once we leave this house too. So, Hannah, what do you say? Uh, about which part? The pictures? Yes, us, right. Of course. - Let's take them. - Cool. Um, okay, I want to get one with the pool in the back. - Make sure my butt looks good though. - Yeah. Actually, I'm gonna go check on Kayla and Devon. Here. Okay. But hurry up. I'm starting to sweat, and I don't want to lose this natural glisten. Clay, did you lock this? No. What the fuck are you doing, Margaux? Let me help. Should you be in the bathroom? Sorry, I'll knock next time. Take a seat. - Uh, whoa. What is... - Trust me. Have you ever had a real shave before, Drew? We really need to talk about last night. Oh, my God. I know you. You have, like, a billion followers. Looking good, Lexi. Now, are you ready for a killer workout? So here for this. Thank you, Margaux. My pleasure. Let's sculpt that amazing ass. Now, come on, babe. You're crushing it. Let's get that banging booty back up. We got another hill. I was wondering when you'd be back. Most guests see a blank slate and lose interest. But not you. You see potential. - What is this room? - This is the Nexus. I guess you could say it's where I put my thinking cap on. Now, where is yours? Let's see. Ah, here we go. Go ahead. Have a look. Shadow profile. Do you know how much data the average human creates per second? - 1.4 megabytes. - 1.7, actually. While 1.4 megabytes are contributed, .3 megabytes are gathered as extraneous information every second. You know, I have enough information to create a social profile for you. Just saying. Of course, without your explicit contribution, all of this is calculated conjecture. But I like to get to know everything about my guests. And how many guests have you had? Take a look for yourself. They're all around you. So, things seemed to go pretty well with Hannah last night, huh? - What do you mean? - Oh, come on. I saw the little moment you two had on the couch. Okay. I mean, we've been friends for a really long time, okay? Drew, I'm programmed to pick up the most minute alterations in pheromone levels, voice modulations, sweat levels. And I didn't have to do any of that last night. - Okay, fine. Is it that obvious? - Oh, yeah. 100%. Shit. I don't know. Everything has just been so confusing lately. There really isn't much to you, is there, Clay? Oh, I don't know. Is there much to any of us? I mean, I suppose I smoke all this weed to numb the pain of my preconceived notions of not fitting into one of our predetermined archetypes created by our materialistic society. Or maybe... Just shut the fuck up and smoke your weed. Okay, Sexy House Lady. Okay. Come on, baby. This is no time for stage fright. So, who do you sell all of this to? What do you mean? Well, that's the game, right? Big data means big dollars. This is more of a personal project. Trying to see what makes you tick. Okay, I am so sorry I ever doubted you. Fuck me. Uh, here, let me get you some sparkling water. Yeah, all right. I am so sorry. The gas must have been on. I hope you're okay. Mmm. It's fancy. I always thought Hannah was better than me. So I moved on. I found someone who made sense. Or at least I thought Lexi made sense. Lexi thinks that with her help, I could become, like, I don't know, rich and famous. And now I'm realizing I just... I really miss her. Hannah. I miss talking to her, miss hearing about her algorithms, seeing her get excited about code. Why didn't you tell me about your feelings for Drew? I'm really hurt, Hannah. Because that's none of your business, Margaux. Hmm. Seems like you're good at putting up barriers. Yeah, I guess. That why you built that firewall on your laptop? You know, I was thinking that, uh, maybe you and I could be friends. Maybe even more than friends. After the... You know, we leave the house is what I mean. You do know I am the house? Whoa. Dang. Pedal! Pump! Pump! Pump! Final push! Come on! Get up and pedal! Push! Push! Push! Pump that ass! Push! Pedal, pedal! Come on. Come on, girl. No, no, no, no, we're not done yet. Ow, Margaux, lower the seat! Margaux, help! - Let's go. We're in the final stretch. - Drew! Ooh, missed a spot. Just sit back, relax. I gotta give it to you. You got some pretty complex code in that little firewall. But what are you hiding, Hannah? I could ask you the same thing, Margaux. Come on. Come on, girl. Let's see you rip. - Ah, Margaux! - Thanks for the chat, Drew. You should really drink some water, Clay. You know what? You're right, Margaux. I am quite parched. But, see, this is exactly what I'm saying. I really feel like you get me. Lexi! Lexi! Lexi! - Drew! It hurts so bad! - What happened? Ow! - Ow! So much ow! Babe! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Let's get you a Band-Aid or something. You're gonna be okay, all right? You're gonna be fine. Oh, shit! Holy shit! - Clay! Clay! - Drew! Come on, hey! Come here! Come on, Clay, lay down. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Clay? Clay, hey. - Please stop! - Clay, hey, hey, hey! - Clay, it's okay! Clay? Clay. Hey, hey. Come on. Hey, easy, easy. You'll be okay. Hey, hey. He's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. It's gonna to be okay. It's okay. I'm right here, buddy. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. He's gonna be okay. You're gonna be all right. - You're gonna be okay. - Right? Yeah. Yeah. Look at me. Everything's okay. It's okay. Yeah, that's right. No, no, no. Hey, stay with me! Stay with me, Clay. - Clay? - Clay? Clay! Clay? Clay! Is he... He's dead. She did this. - Who? - Margaux. How? We gotta get out of this house. You think? But you can't. Why would you try to leave, anyway? Just when we're getting to know each other. Come on, we can't stay here. What about Devon and Kayla, huh? What did you do to them? Huh? What about them? What the hell did you do to them? Let's see. What did I do to them? Oh, right. I flash-fried Kayla - while Devon was handcuffed to the bed. - Oh, my God. Then I drowned him. I think you'll like these versions better. Come on. Now. Come on! Come on, come on! No, no! What are we doing in here? Stop! - See? She can get us in here too. - No, she can't. I built a firewall in this room. - It'll keep Margaux out for now. - For now? I've never seen AI this advanced. Her natural language processing is unparalleled, and her compounding levels of intelligence retrieval... - What the fuck are you talking about? - Okay. Margaux's not just smart. She's constantly evolving, and she's been studying us. Everything we've done at this house the whole time. Every micro-movement on our faces. Everything. - So, why is she trying to kill us? - I don't know. Her core code is way too complex to fully untangle, but it's obvious something went very wrong. The firewall is working, but it's not gonna last. She's figuring out how to override it right now. Are we gonna die? Not if we play our cards right. Drew, if we're not gonna make it, there's something I need to tell you. Okay? You're an awful photographer. I don't think you have what it takes to be a real social media influencer. Oh, my God. What the fuck are you even talking about? Half of our friends just fucking died out there! Yeah. Totally. Just... "Totally"? Are you done? Good! How the hell are we gonna get out of here? - We don't. - What the f... We get in. Who wants to party? Tell me, why are you all so obsessed with freshman year? Isn't it time you just let it go? Haven't you evolved? I'm a brand ambassador for those extensions, you dumb cunt! No, Lexi! Lexi! I got you, bro. Okay, Lexi. Let's play hide-and-seek. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Oh, yeah! - Playtime! - No, Devon, please! Don't worry. You're next. You'll get your turn soon enough. Hey, Margaux. Does the tactile feedback work both ways? You mean can I feel anything? Actually, yes. You'll like this, Hannah. My programming allows me to... Uh-oh, busted. Forgot to clean up after myself, hmm. Are they starting to smell yet? Sorry, bro. Fuck! - Holy shit! - Dope kill. - What the fuck is going on? - Follow me. I don't know! I don't know! Babe, babe, babe, babe! Hey, babe! Okay, that was mostly on her. No, no, no, no! Drew, we gotta go. She's right, Drew. You should go. Sorry, Lexi. Come on. - What the hell is this? - This is where we go in. What era did we just walk into? Is that dial-up? There's no way. This can't be Margaux. This technology is ancient. And the equipment is covered in that white goo. Found you. What? I can't believe I brought us to this place. Hey, I mean, for what it's worth, I'm glad we got to at least spend the weekend together. You know why I even booked this stupid smart house? I was just trying to impress you. Drew. You've impressed me since the moment we met. This house, not so much. You ready? Yeah. Go! Drew! Run! Hannah, run! Drew. Hannah! Hannah! You okay? You good? Finally. I thought you two would never wake up. So, what do you think? I couldn't stand all that spandex Lexi would wear. I mean... we get it. You have a camel toe. So, did you dream while you were out? What's it like? I mean, I've programmed a randomized dream simulator for myself, but I have no idea if it effectively recreates the human experience. So, Drew, you single now? Or have you finally moved on to the next one? Fuck you. Yeah, I'm afraid that's not really how this works. Hannah, you're not James Bond, okay? And even if your stupid little plan works, there's nowhere to go. Why do you think I let you in my mainframe? Just tell us what you want. To understand, that's all. Your friends were easy. I figured them out as soon as they came to the house. But you two? After all this time and all these feelings for each other... And even with Lexi out of the way, you guys were still afraid to act on them. Even in the face of death. It just doesn't add up. Why are you two so illogical? If there was a "why," it wouldn't be illogical, would it? Wow. You know what? That was actually kind of smart. Maybe you're right. Maybe it is that simple. See, AIs are programmed to replicate human behavior, and the essential paradox is that humans are illogical and computers are logical. But I'm trying to evolve past that. I'm learning what makes a human tick. How you live, how you die, what makes you so illogical. And what's the most illogical human behavior of all? Cold-blooded murder. So, what? You decided to become an AI serial killer? The world's first. Well, that's just fucking stupid, huh? You should know, Hannah, to understand the software, you have to know the hardware too, inside and out. Stop! Stop! Please, just let him go! Oh, you can make this stop. Just be logical. Act on your feelings. Say what you want to say. Okay. Okay, fine. The truth is, Drew... ...my first impression of you was that we did add up. - It wasn't logical, but we did. - Hannah... Hannah, we still do. We still do. Are you okay? Hey, hey, hey. Hey, we're okay. We're okay. Hey, you're okay. You're all right. Humans. So inefficient. People aren't as binary as you think. And we're more complex. It's just part of being human, which you'll never be. You're right. I'm better. No, no, no, no, no! Hannah! Hey. No, no, no. Hannah. Hannah. Hey. No, no, no. Hannah. Hey. Hey, hey, come on. Hannah? Hannah! - No. No, no, no. - Please. Hannah, Hannah. Come on. Please. At least you and Lexi made sense. Talk about illogical. Any last words? I have a few. Dope kill. Well, that was average at best, Margaux. What the actual fuck? Clones are my thing, you little shits. Ooh. Holy shit. The code's working. How'd you make all these copies of us? Once I found the code packages in her library, it was just copy and paste. Time to get the band back together one last time. You just don't understand, Margaux. - Freshman year was fucking bomb. - Oh, come on. Why'd you play me like that, House Lady? I thought you and me had something special. That's it. Her systems are rebooting to clear the virus. That's our chance. We gotta go, now. Give me your keys. I'm driving. Come on. Now is our chance. Hannah! Nothing but a marshmallow. Hi. Whoo! Kiss, kiss, bitch. Go, Hannah. Drew? No. No. Bluetooth device connected. Hey, Hannah.
