Do you like ice-cream? Do you eat ice-cream? You don't want it? What would you like? Aren't you hungry? Your stomach hurts? Are you okay? Your stomach hurts? What should I do? Want to go to the hospital? Mom? Uhm? Come on, what is it? [girl] It hurts. Come on, come on. It hurts. I get it, I get it. Let's eat, okay? Have a nice meal! Oh, everything okay? Is this getcha?

You are seven and you like strawberries. What about your name? Ayako. Ayako? What is it? Is it there? You don't know? Oh, what beautiful flowers. Where is your house, Ayako? There. There? Mother might be waiting because... Please go back. Mom... you know drank the pesticide to pass away... I'm back home. Oh, ah! I drank too much! Ayako. Please... A glass of water. Water! Ouch! - Aya! - Yes. Were you awake? Yes, yes. Thank you. Will you shower? Ah, it felt so good. That middle-aged man. Do you know Mr Ishida? Hamo! He treated me to Hamo. [an expensive fish] Oops, I fell. Don't enter the house from the back. Sis! It's dangerous. - What are you doing... - Sorry. Are you okay? What were you doing? Nothing in particular, I didn't do much. I might have drank a little too much. Ouch! Ouch! What are you doing? It hurts! - You drank way too much! - It hurts... Come on, go have a shower. Do you want another glass of water? - No. - No? Watch out, it's dangerous. - Aren't you showering? - No. Morning, Excuse me. Morning, Excuse me. This morning, the old man died. I'll go first and please come as soon as possible. Got it. Count loudly, please. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Please, be careful where you step. Is somebody helping you go back home? Is there anybody helping you? Be careful going back home, okay? Be careful. Onishi-san, next! Who is this? My wife. Your grandmother. Kioki... your grandmother. This one here is your mother. Your passed away mother. Everyone is under a chosen stone. Together they are one family. Hey, Daiji. Here you know, I'd like to make a big oven as big as your mother's belly. Your grandmother, you know... died two days before I came back from the war. After she passed away, your mother was crying next to your grandmother... and was hungry! Since then... She did her best to live. Soon after your mother gave birth to you, she passed away. It's not very good to stay together for too long. 100 yen change. Thank you. One! Two! Three! Four! One! Two! Three! Four! Looks like she got hit, call an ambulance. Are you okay? It'll come soon. I got you one month leave from the office. I'll be working starting tomorrow. Let go! It's okay. What is it? What? What? Just for today... let's stay together. Come on. Ayako! I got it. I get it. I get it! I'm staying here overnight. But you do as you like. I'm here. Don't make me worry. Thank you. Whatcha doin? Taking a walk. What's ahead? Nothing. 'The depth of the mountains' It would be better to see if any valuables are gone. - That's OK, I don't really care. - Are you okay? Let go. Hey, what are you doing!? Let go! - Don't.... - Calm down! Leave me be. - Calm down! -What is it? Enough, stop it. Enough with this... Let go. Enough! Calm down! What, let me go, stop! Get off. Stop it now. What did you say? As if that matters! Why you... Why did you try to kill yourself? Don't run away. [In front of a public bath house] Whatcha doin? Aren't you all wet! Why don't come? [get a bath] - Hey. - Uhm? What? What's up? I am, you know... a dancer, a stripper. Do you understand? Yes. Have you ever seen it? Yeah. Do you get it? I get naked. You don't have anything to say? Why do I have to listen to this? Why are you asking me? Why don't you answer? Is it necessary? It is. Well then. Why? Spit it out. So my feelings, relate to the matter? - Of course. - Why? - I want to know them. - What then? I'm telling you I want to be together... together... with you. And you? Why do you avoid it? - I'm not. - You are. Why? How am I avoiding it? You do, you didn't reply. How so, After I heard you were a stripper, I still said I wanted to be with you. - And what do you think about it? - What for? I want to ask. Why do you want to ask? I want to. I don't understand why you want to ask. Don't you want to be together with me? If that's not the case, you think something's off? Why have you been making such scary eyes? From the start. Is there something sad? I ask because I want us to be together. Uhm? I want us to be together, that's why I ask. Isn't that OK? - No. - Why not? Because I want to ask! Hey. Say it. Sis... Sister! Sister! Sister! After I finish here... I'd like to go back to my home town. Is that alright? Go now. Thank you. Oh, Daiji! - Mr Oma! - How's it going? So hot. Every time I use the oven, it comes out differently. A few of them are good. Wanna see them? Wah, here the scenery is good as always. Yeah, I guess. I used to come here to talk with Mr. Kane. I just went to see Kane's oven. You did quite a lot by yourself! - Omasan, wait a bit. - Yes? I'll get the pottery, so we can look at it right away. I was curious about it. Sorry. It's this one. I don't think it came out well, though. The one by Mr Kane is still here? It could be. These three... are grandpa's. As I thought. I can tell. Wonderful! You can see it? As I thought, Daiji-kun. You know there are chains. Chains like this... the next link links like this. They look like opposing each other but the original chain faces the same direction. Like a parent and child face opposite sides, the grandchildren will loop back and face the original direction. So, these chains... at some point, they'll connect again. And once again your grandpa comes out from you. The second and the third by Kane-san. Don't sever the link! Ah! I'm relieved. It's real good. Well, we were all worried... You can go home. They'll be happy. Mr. Kane always supervised my work. Thank you, I was worried. - Do you need anything today? - I want to make curry. Curry, huh? - How are you today, daddy? - Well, thanks to you. Not at all. Curry! Curry? The simplest most convenient dish? - How rude! - Very simple indeed. - Got the medium-spiced one? - Medium-spiced? Yes, we do. No carrots at all? - You don't want them? - Nope. - You dislike 'em? - No, I like them but I got tired. 1069 yen. 1000, 1000 is fine. 1000 is fine Here it is, sis. Oh, thank you for calling me sis. Thank you. If you called me old-lady, I'd make it expensive instead. Oh really? As if I didn't know. You came back. Yes. 'Welcome back' 'I'm back!' 'Welcome back' 'I'm back' Isn't everything good? What's that? This. It's plates for the lantern festival. At the Gang≈ç-ji temple. I feel strange, this is embarrassing. What are you up to today? - Uhm? - What are you up to, today? Ah, I made some curry. Want to have some? I'd eat a ton! I'm super hungry! I'll bring you some. I'll bring you some. - I'll bring it. - Quickly. - I'm back! - Welcome back! Thank you for the hard work! For real! Desert? What's that? It's good. I'll feed it to you. What? Why not? - Wait a second! - No, here it comes. - Wait please! - Quickly! And that's that. - Tastes good. - Very. - This... - You want it? - "I'll aeat" - Huh? You'll eat it? Give it here, quick. Please. What's up? Come on. I got that! I won't let you go. The way you fed me was heartless. What are you saying, idiot. Be kinder. Feed me with care. That's somewhat too... It tasted extremely good. I was thinking... of going to my parent's house When? The day after tomorrow. - For how long? - For five days. Where is it? Sakaide, Kagawa prefecture. Kawachichou district. (Now Kawatsuchou) Super into the countryside. - I don't know any of that. - You certainly don't. Kagawa huh? I only know Udon is famous, but I've been only to Tokushima. For me it has been 10 years. Really? Because I ran away from home. Is that so. You'll meet everybody? No, only my grandmother. I'm nervous. I'm nervous. I'm starting to get really nervous. It's good that you're meeting her. She'll be happy. Oh, by the way... What is it? I wrote your name on it. You like it? - Do you like it? - Yes. I'll give it to you. - Is it really OK? - Yes, I've got a lot. Really? Do you know the Gangouji temple? - Yes. - That temple. There, you know, there is a lantern festival. Did you know? I do but I don't know what it's about. There are Jizo statues, and a lot of lantern offerings are all lit together. All around the Jizo statues aligned with one another. It's about Jizo, it's a memorial service So, you write down your wish on the lantern... then line it up... and so, this year I'm helping them. That's great. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Wanna come? - Come. - Yes. I'd like you to help me. About that, let's write down our wishes. No? [No, it's OK] I'm looking forward to it. Come for sure. OK. It'll be fun. That's great. It's about... Soon the gates will open and the customers will be here. Soon. Hello! Next, we will have all the girls from the first show together, it's the final show of the Pachinkos. Enjoy the show! Please give a big welcome to the girls! Let's welcome Miss Terasaki Nana! Let us welcome Miss Igarashi Nami! Let us welcome Miss Aikawa Izumi! Let us welcome Miss Shina Yuri. Let us welcome Miss Sawa Aya! Let us welcome the Princess Miss Kyouko! Here are all the members, please enjoy! Enjoy the final show of the Pachinkos. [Repeating names] - Thank you for your... - Freeze, everybody! Police! Don't move around, sit! Sit down! Turn on the lights! Quickly, turn on the lights! Sit, sit down! I got it, stop that! Don't move, sit down. Over there, don't move! Sit! I told you to sit down! It's the police. Come on, sit! [unintelligible explanations] [chanting a sutra] The words of Jizo, which are called in Sanskrit "the K·π£itigarbha", are about what's within a mother, also known as the womb. "The womb like the earth." quoting our ancestors. Everyone's father and mother, then grandfather and grandmother, are connected generation after generation... Within. That is how we now exist. As we thank the womb, our blessing, it is our duty to convey thoughtfully all the things that we find ourselves able to convey thoughtfully. And as we think this sort of thing, we find the privilege to commemorate Jizo-san. I wish to have conveyed these feelings. Thank you very much for today. And thank you for your time. Today it's pointless. Why? I've come to check today as well, but everyone got taken by the police. - The police? - Yes. - What time? - Midday. Let us... forget about it and go drink together. Nah, it's okay. - Is that so? - Well then. Welcome back. Today, the Katoukisen jambo ferry welcomes you on the Konpira2 boat. Our most sincere thanks. This boat... departs from the 3rd breakwater of the Sannomiya Shinkou port, and arrives at the Takamatsuhigashi port. Sorry for the long wait. The ferry will be departing at 9:50 PM Departing for Kobe San-no miya. Katoukisen welcomes you. Please validate your tickets when embarking. The customers who came by car, can find their way in through... Our pedestrian customers can turn left at our ticket office to find their way in. [repeating and inaudible] Grandma. Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! - Excuse me! - Yes! Mizusa's household should be around here, but... Ah, Mrs Mizusa? - Do you see that Dragon Juniper? - Dragon Juniper? That kind of Japanese white oak tree. There in front of you. Yes, that large one. Thank you! Why did you hang up on me? I finally found you. What's up? Uhm? What? I'm burning trash. What? I can't hear you. - What? - I'm burning litter. I understand that, but... The fire's out. What about grandma? Grandma died. When? Yesterday. The fire's out. Fire's out. We'll make another. Ayako. I don't understand why it won't light up. I got it, we'll do it. - Do it quickly. - I got it. We'll make it. I got it. Look at me. I got it, I got it. We'll make it, wait a second. I... you know. I couldn't meet my grandma. If the police hadn't arrested me that day, I might have been able to meet her. She was walking by the highway... alone, in the middle of the night. She went up from behind the mountain street in a pitch black place... completely alone... walking aimlessly. That looks difficult. I'll help you out. Why? - I don't need any help. - Why's that? - Let me try. - Grandma did it alone. Come on. I don't need any help. What's that? I'm saying I want to help! You are alone?! Are you alone? You don't listen when people talk to you? Do what the hell you want! You should mix it more. From the bottom. - You want a cup? - Yes, please. What a bizarre bottle opener. Let's go! Old lady! Another one! Old lady: Impressive! What's wrong? - I've had enough. - How come? "On the mountain the bell's temple rings" That's how the song goes. It's time for the sun to sink. It's beautiful scenery, isn't it? The sinking of the sun, on the other side of the mountain. It meets the Sukhavati paradise. Amitabha's Pure Land. I wonder if that's what our ancestors thought was there. At least I'd like to think it's true. A world where who passed away can rest. That's what the Sukhavati paradise is. The people around us and ourselves, will certainly reincarnate in Sukhavati. I would like to believe in it. Don't you like the idea? Hand it over and let me try. - Thank you for your work! - Thank you. Alright, give me your hand. ‚ô™ -are in bloom [Common Japanese elementary school song] ‚ô™ The memories of the road ‚ô™ ‚ô™ The Hill road ‚ô™ [Song Name: mikan no hana saku oka] The shimenawa...

That you know. I'll set it up starting from New Year's eve. uhm. Want to set it up together? It'll be 250 en. So bright! It's OK, is it? You mean it? 250 en... Thank you very much! This one! Yup. Oh please, next! Here we go! Well, time for work. I bounce! Thank you. - Take care! - Thank you. Here we go. Well, seeya! Bye bye! Be careful! Thanks for the meal. That's good. - Is it? - Yes. As always. I'd like to quit the job in 3 months. I'd also like some days off to go in the countryside on New Year's days. [New Year days are usually Jan 1, 2 and 3.] Wanna go together? [yes] - The Chinese cabbage's delicious. - Thank you very much. Should we get ready? Yes. Understood. Thank you for your hospitality. I let this to you, ok? It's ok thank you. Sis?

Can you take me out of here? I'd like to be taken out. Outside... The big... Just when like I was a kid... a thin snail stuck through my feet. My mother gave me a piggy-back ride, bringing me to the hospital. My father was there... It was nice. (to have a family) If I was born again... I'd like to be a... ballet dancer. What a nice feeling. Not exactly happy, not exactly sad. Thank you. Thank you. It somewhat... feels nice.
