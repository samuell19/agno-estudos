Yes, yes, oh my God, you guys are the bomb, seriously, wow. - I told you. - Never doubted. You know, if they can score like this all the time, then. - Even the score, this isn't a food bank. - Uh, look, I know I said it would be good, but things just got a little tight, you know how it is. - I don't know how it is, what do you mean, tight? Do you have my money or not? - Yeah, yeah, but can you just, like, you know, work with me here a bit? - Thing is, it's not just me you're working with. There's other people who are involved here, and these people don't fuck around or play games. - I understand, fully, I do, you know, this ain't my first, I'm all about business, right? But just so at the moment, okay, it's an in between kinda situation, right, so there's gotta be some way, there's no way we can lay it off for a bit until I can move a little of that something something? - Something of what? - I've got some genuine anxious customers, man. I could vend that sweetness right this afternoon and have the cash in your hand first thing tomorrow, breakfast like. - Oh, I seem to attract idiots. - So... - So what? - So can you hook me up and I can do my thing and I'll make squares and tada? - I don't do fronts, you know that. - Of course, what the fuck do I look like? Actually, don't answer that, listen. This time, first last and only, right? You hook me up with this connect and I'll owe you. I'll owe you hard. - Maybe we can work something out. - Yes, thank you, seriously, thank you, for real. I'll take 100 of those sick pinks, we've got a lot of requests for them since last time. - I have the pinks, but I got something better, something much, much better. - What are those? - The cost is 10, you sell 'em for 20, I'll give 'em to you for seven. - Seven, shit, all right, great, man, that'll cover the cost for the wine and the front or? - Don't worry about the front, just peddle them. - Damn straight I'm gonna, thanks. What do you call this shit? - Black candy. - Hey, I know this is a bit much, but I need a personal top up too. - Shit, Jesus. - Hey, come on, man, it's not much, just throw it in the mix on the tab, it's just a couple grams of crystal to see me through. - I got something for you. Consider this a bonus if you move all the pills. Don't dose on the black ones. - Hey, hey, no problem, big rules of retail, right? Washroom's for paying customers only, don't stroke the boss and don't do your own inventory. Can Vic come out to play? - No, mate, let me just check my schedule. - You bastard. - Playtime. - Yeah, as in? Prepare for liftoff. - What is this craziness? - Calls itself black candy and it's the atomic deal. - Doesn't look that tough. - But it is, there's some serious fucked up chemistry in that little rocket. - Yeah, fucked up is one thing, rocket? That's another. - That shit will take you to the other side of everywhere. - I don't know, man, you got any of those pinks? That was some heady shit. - Hahah, man, that shit makes pinks obsolete. Besides, it's the same lab busting it out as the others, as in new and improved, like. - Oh, really? - Mmhmm, tell you what. How 'bout I give you a taste, see if you like it? - On the house? - On the house. - Aw man. - I'm a generous man. - And it's appreciated. - Hey, mind if I kick it here for a little bit, get a little hardwired? - Yeah, man, cool your boots, you want a beer or anything? - Definitely. - All right, I don't have any fancy wine for you, though. - Oh shit.

Will he? - This is a guy who drinks a 2012 La Montrechet Grand Croux on the rocks in a mason jar. - All right, how was I supposed to know it was such a big such and such? - 'Cause I told you it was. - Okay, in my defense, it was hot, I was thirsty, so sue me or worse. - Look, he's never gonna let you forget it. - No, I won't. So how was it anyways, I mean, no posts, no emails, no updates, we were worried about you. - You were worried. - I mean, curious. Whether or not you were killed and eaten by the natives. - It's part of the United States. - This is you we're talking about. - This was a legitimate concern. - Okay, we need drinks, for God's sake, drinks. - I shall proceed with the uncorking, where's the decanter? - The, the what? - Ugh, I guess we'll just have to let the wine breathe on its own like it's only slightly ideal. - As long as it's only slightly ideal, that's cool. How's it breathing in there? - Oh, it's breathing. Here. And here. In vino, veritas. - Oh, sorry, we can't. - Why? - It's not right. - Not right, this is a goddamn 2009 Margo Bordeaux. More than all right. - I suppose I'm impressed, but it's not right for this moment. - What moment? - This welcome back home toast moment. - Have you got the Polynesian flu or something? - No, better, I have got the last of the Mohicans, well, the Aztecs, hold on. - He must have hit his head or something. - Ah, hasn't changed a bit. - Hey, did you notice his tan?

You want to take? First of all, I don't see any goddamn sticks here. Second of all, you need a fucking knife to whittle, do you have a knife, Gav? - No. - And if I had a knife, I would just fucking use that knife. Not that it would be any fucking use here anyways. So please. - No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't wanna. - What happened to all that this ain't you stuff, this ain't me, this ain't us? - I don't know. - Okay. Okay, fine, maybe, maybe we'll just. Maybe you're right, we'll just hide out here and we'll lay low, right, and we'll hold our breaths and come down and maybe it'll all just be sorta. It'll all be fine. Okay, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that was stupid. I'm scared, and I'm tripped out as all fuck. I'm not thinking so straight. - Right. It's just that I. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. - I know. I don't either. We ain't gonna go out like this. - Okay. So what now? - Hey, uh. I gotta tell you something. - What? - I'm pregnant.
