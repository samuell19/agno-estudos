And now, children. We come to one of the most famous. And most priceless pictures in the whole world. The Medici Venus. I want you to notice the beauty and delicacy of the composition. And the flesh tints. Isn't she a little bit skinny, teacher? Not skinny, Tommy. She is .. Well, slender. She is the embodiment of female grace and form. All visitors out please. Come along, children. We must be going. All visitors out please. Closing time. All visitors out please. Closing time. Hey, Bert! Hey! Yes? What's up? Come here, quick. It's gone. Look. Look! "Sorry, but I had a better use for this." "The Amateur Cracksman." Read about it. Old master still missing. Paper, paper. "Cracksman laughs at police." "Tell me what is wrong with Scotland Yard." "There is an enquiry demanded .." MacKenzie, I want to warn you. You'd better not take this thing too calmly. What with the newspapers and the questions in parliament. Scotland Yard is being made a complete laughing stock. This sort of thing has got to be stopped. Once and for all. I'm busy. - Sir, it's about .. I don't care what it's about. - But it's about the picture, sir. The Venus, sir. That's it. The one that everybody is talking about. Do you mean that you can tell us something about it? Do you think you've got a clue? - No. I've got the picture. Here, sit down. Sit down. Well, upon my soul. What is your name please? Maud Holden. How did you get this? It just came in the post. In the ordinary way. I opened the parcel. And there it was. And this was with it. - Oh. "I saw your farewell performance when I was a boy. I have never forgotten it." "Would you return this to .." "Dear old Scotland Yard for me." "I understand there is a reward offered." "Amateur Cracksman." Well. So you are Maud Holden the actress? - Well. I used to be. When was your farewell performance, Miss Holden? Oh .. twenty years ago. 1919. Aye. You don't think I've had anything to do with this, do you? The theft, I mean. - No, no. Of course not, Miss Holden. Thank you very much. I think I can promise you the reward. Thank you, sir. It seems as if the amateur cracksman is somewhat of a benefactor, Miss Holden. Well. In this case .. yes. But I don't want anything said of it. Don't worry, Miss Holden. We're no more anxious for the publicity than you are. Thank you. Good day. Good day. This is the picture alright. - And do you think that will help us? You see, we'll be more of a laughing stock than ever if this news gets out. Can't find the criminal. Can't even find the picture and the confounded thing is handed to us. If it wasn't for him, I'd .. [ Radio: ] "Mr Raffles is bowling today." "Apparently, he had the Australian batsmen completely baffled." "Mr Raffles is getting ready to bowl now." "There goes the ball. There go the wickets. He's done it!" "And it's seven wickets for Mr Raffles." Mr Bunny Manders is on the telephone, sir. He wants to come and pick you up. Not now. Tell him I'll meet him at The Ambassador. Very good, sir. Mr Raffles thanks you, sir. He says he'll have to meet you at The Ambassador Club. And if you will excuse me, sir. - Yes? What is it? It is these bills, sir. Some of them are becoming .. If you will pardon the expression, sir, a trifle exigent. You said the grim total is 200 pounds? - Yes, sir. I'm arranging for that this evening. - Very good, sir. [ Alarm bell! ] Blimey, look! There is your burglar. Must have got locked in. Looks like he's having a good time too. Here, get him off that alarm button. Come on, Pussy. Well, will you put handcuffs on him, Philips? I don't think so. I don't think he'll try to get away. No tricks now. I think I'd better take him back home. Rascal. Making all this row. And don't try and steal my watch. You are a concern. I think I'd better take him home, eh. Well, my missus won't have him in the house. I promise you that. I'm going to try to sneak him into my house. Good evening, Inspector. - Hello, Philips. Everything quiet? Is that under arrest? Yes, sir. Taking him in for giving a false alarm at Baldridge's. What's that? A kitten in Baldridge's? - We found him playing with the alarm. It doesn't sound right to me. - Not right? There's no way of getting in Baldridge's without setting off the alarm. If somebody knew that they might bring along a kitten. Get some men round the back of the shop. - Yes, sir. Come with me. - Yes, sir. Hello, A.J. Good show today. - Thank you very much. Good work, Raffles. - Thank you, sir. Good evening, Mr Raffles. - Get me a packet of Hiltons, please. Thank you. Ah, A.J. We thought you wouldn't show up. I've been telling Gwen you'd come. That means I got here just in time. Your brother is an atrocious dancer. Bunny. A waltz is a thing of grace and poise. You take the lady's hand, so. Place your right hand, so. See you later. But Lady Melrose is waiting for you. This brother and sister dancing should be discouraged I think. Especially if the sister is you. - Can this be you talking? Yes, I think so. - Gwen. Lady Melrose. - Pretend you didn't hear. Gwen, dear. If we don't go to her, she'll come and get us. Lady Melrose. How do you do, Mr Raffles. I am so glad to meet you. I can't see why she wants to meet you. She doesn't give a hoot on cricket. No. But I know a personable young man when I see one. Sit down there. Gwen, come here. May we have your picture, Mr Raffles? Do you mind, Lady Melrose? Not at all. Just look at each other if you will. How could I look anywhere else. Thank you. Getting that old face of yours in the papers again, my dear? Yes. I thought I would have to go through the divorce court to do that. At my time of life. Well, I'm very glad to see you, Raffles. I've been to Lords every day this week. A splendid show. Congratulations. Thank you very much. I'm very proud to meet you. I saw you play for the gentlemen in 1919. Did you, by gad? Don't encourage him, Mr Raffles. Or you will be hearing all his cricket history. You rescue me. Come and dance. - Yes, I'd like to. I think you'd better dance with Gwen. I was beginning to feel like the other woman. Mind you hurry back. - We will. Now that is what I call a really charming man. He was my house captain at school you know. There was nobody like him. And he hasn't changed a bit. Well, come and sit here by me until he comes back. I'm afraid I have to get back to barracks, Lady Melrose. "Barracks"? Nonsense. A date with a chorus girl, most likely. Don't be so old-fashioned, George. But you brought Mr Raffles, so I forgive you. You and Gwen are coming down tomorrow for the weekend. Don't forget. There is just the possibility I may not be able to manage it. I'll phone in the morning, if I may. - Alright. By the way, we've got a new telephone exchange down there. I'll write down the number for you. I've got to run along. You'll see Gwen home, won't you A.J.? - You leaving? Yes, I've got to. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Do you mind seeing me home? - Mind? I'm in luck. Oh, you are saying the nicest things tonight. I am? Oh, it just comes natural. I haven't been drinking. Oh .. Gwen. There is that voice again. Mr Raffles. We've been glad to see you. Goodnight, Gwen darling. Goodnight. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Where to, sir? 15 Lennox Mews, please. Very good, sir. Come on, Lucy. Come on. Come on. Do you know that I've never ridden in one of these things before. I'm glad you haven't. - Why? Oh, I don't know. Maybe because I should like you to remember this evening as well as shall. You know, you're a strange person. Strange? Well, why am strange? You say things like that just to encourage a girl and then .. The next item we meet you are .. Terribly nice and polite and .. Distant. Why, it's not very easy to be distant in a hansom cab even if you want to be. And I don't. You know Gwen, when you used to visit Bunny at school. I was terribly in love with you. I was always far too scared to let you know. Nine years ago. You've changed a good deal since then. Too much, perhaps. And not all for the better. What do you mean? - Oh, nothing. Now there you are. That's what I mean when I say you're mysterious. Tell me your big secret. Because I felt for a long time that you had one somewhere in your life. I'm awfully tempted to tell you just one secret anyway. It's simply this. I'm still in love with you. Oh, I am so happy. I could laugh or sing or something. Or just chatter. Oh darling, so could I. Can't you make it down to Melrose this weekend? We could have so much time together. - With you? Well .. of course I can. Whoa, Lucy. Whoa. Here we are, sir. Already? Once more around the paddock? - Yes. If it ain't too late for you, it certainly ain't for me. Come on, Lucy. Barraclough. Barraclough. I am coming, sir. Did you call me, sir? - Yes. Did I wake you up? It's perfectly alright, sir. - That means I did. I'm sorry. Have a drink, Barraclough. - Have a drink, sir? I'll pour it out for you. I'd rather not if you don't mind, sir. - I do mind. How much soda? Well, if you insist, sir. I will take mine without soda. A splendid idea. It is an old family custom. - Oh, indeed? To the Barracloughs. - To the Barracloughs. I beg your pardon, sir. Thank you. Tell me, Barraclough. Why have you never been married? Surely there must have been some woman in your life? There was, sir. Two of them to be exact. That was years ago. Neither of them became Mrs Barraclough? - No, sir. Perhaps that was because I knew them both at the same time. It didn't seem to work out. Perhaps you're wondering why I'm in such a gay mood tonight? No, sir. I think I've already guessed the reason, sir. You have? From the tenor of the conversation. With your permission, sir. I should say that you have met a lady. The lady. Barraclough, you're positively psychic. Thank you, sir. Are you contemplating matrimony, sir? If she'll have me. I'm turning over a new leaf. After tonight the old Raffles is no more. Behold the new. Love does some strange things, sir. Barraclough, you need another drink. No, sir. I'd rather not if you don't mind. I've become very talkative and I insist on singing. Ha. Well, what's the matter with that? I sing very badly, sir. Is that all, sir? That's all, Barraclough. For you. For me, life is just beginning. I see, sir. Barraclough, did I remember to say she's the most wonderful girl in the world? I had hoped, sir. That you were going to spare me that. Goodnight, sir. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Look. Well, what do you make of it? How did it come? - In that cigarette packet. Hiltons. Fingerprints? - I've just sent for Evans. These please. - Very good, sir. "My farewell performance." First the picture and then this. What do you make of it? Is the fellow reforming? I don't know about that, sir. But I know that he can't wipe out a crime by this sort of thing. "Farewell performance". Pah! He thinks he has the right to end things just because he thinks he will. But that's where he is wrong. We'll give him his farewell performance. Have you got something? He has. - What is it? "West Milton 28." Looks like a telephone number. - It is. Foster. Foster, is that you? Find out whose telephone number is .. West Milton 28. I will hold on. That will be all, Evans. - Yes, sir. Yes. Yes. Lord Melrose? Are you sure about that? Thanks. The telephone number belongs to the country house of Lord Melrose in Essex. West Milton. Come on, Mr Raffles. Show us what you can do. Jolly decent of His Lordship to give Mr Raffles for our side. Aye, it will give us a chance for once. Give it everything you've got, Mr Raffles. Fine bowling, Raffles. Come on, Mr Raffles. Here I am. Harry. You frightened me. - Don't be so jumpy. The old girl bring the necklace down with her? - Yes. You saw to that, eh? You got a little plan of the layout like I told you? Yes. Here it is. The big tree is just opposite this window. This is Lady Melrose's room. First door on your right. I can do it with my eyes shut. Harry, don't you think we ought to give it up? If you're caught it's prison. For me too. - Will you take hold of yourself. You want to go to Australia don't you? You want to have your own little farm? You know I do. - Well, stop worrying. Don't forget, a sleeping powder in the old girl's milk tonight. I won't forget it. Now, we'd better not be seen talking to one another. Howzat! Thank goodness that's over. Now we shan't have to go through it again for another year. Oh Lady Melrose, I don't believe you dislike cricket as much as you pretend. My dear, it bores me to death. It bores poor Gin and Tonic too. Come along, darlings. Come with mummy. Shall I take them, Milady? - Thank you, Wilson. Goodbye everybody. See you later. And Wilson, I will wear the gold dress tonight. Such a nice girl, Wilson. She's the only maid I've ever had who doesn't breathe on me. Have you finished in there? A.J. I've got to talk to you. What is it? Well .. I'm in trouble. Bad trouble, A.J. I've been nearly off my head all day. I phoned your flat this morning. But they told me you'd come down here and that's what brought me. Is it money? Bad? How bad? Worse than you can imagine. Oh, I've been a fool. I've been gambling. It's at thousand pounds. All in one go? No, it's been going on for weeks. I don't know what started me. But that isn't the point. Last night after I left you, I .. I had a final plunge to get it back. And of course I lost. But this time it wasn't my money. They were mess funds I took. This morning I found out there is an audit coming on Monday. Oh, I see. I'm just a common thief. I'll be cashiered, disgraced. They will put me in jail. I've been thinking about doing myself in. You know that wouldn't help. - It would get me out of it. What about Gwen? Would you do that to her? What am I going to do? I don't know yet. You need a thousand pounds by Monday. Is that it? - Yes. I don't mind telling you I haven't got it. You haven't? No. But that doesn't mean it can't be got. You mean that? Practically anything can be if it has to be and quite obviously this has to be. The only question is how. There is not a lot of time. That was lovely. I hope that interruption didn't disturb you just now. That husband of mine. Bunny. Cheer up. Everything is going to be alright. You mean I can count on it? - Every penny of it. Thanks, A.J. What? - Did you enjoy it, sir? Oh yes. Splendid, splendid. Nothing like a whiskey and soda after music. How about a spot in the library? - That's a good idea, sir. Come along, come along. - Thank you. If you can't do it Raffles nobody else can. Bless my soul. Scotland Yard? Scotland Yard, did you say? Yes. Inspector MacKenzie. Alright. Show him in. Show him in. - Yes sir. What on earth do you suppose Scotland Yard wants here? I can't imagine. Lord Melrose? Inspector MacKenzie? Well, what is it? What do you want? If you don't mind, sir. My business is confidential. Nonsense, nonsense. These are my guests. This is Mr Whitely, Mr Thorndyke. And Mr Raffles. Mr A.J. Raffles, the cricketer? Oh, I am a great admirer of yours, sir. Well, I've long been a great admirer of yours. Oh, I've read a lot about you. You're quite a famous person. Thank you, Mr Raffles. Now if you will kindly tell me what your business is. Lord Melrose. We have reason to believe that an attempt will be made to rob this house. Oh, I say. - Not really? I take you to mean burglars? A burglar. A? Meaning one? Aye. This is very disturbing. My wife is nervous enough already. We've been reading all about this chap in the papers. Oh, what's his name? The Amateur Cracksman. Ha. Amateur Cracksman. The names these journalists invent. Besides, there doesn't seem to be much very amateur about him by all accounts. What do you say, Inspector? - I agree. He is misnamed. I call him just a thief. As I told you, Inspector. Lady Melrose is a very nervous woman. I don't want her to know anything about this. Not a thing. Or any of my other guests. - I understand. I am afraid she may come in at any moment. Raffles, would you mind going out to her? Well, it's been very nice meeting you, Inspector. Excuse me. Now, Inspector. What do you propose to do? I wonder would it be inconveniencing you too much Lord Melrose .. If I was to stay here for a while? Stay here? Bless my soul. What am I going to say to people? Well, if I might suggest. An old friend. - An old friend? Well, you leave me no alternative. By the way, Lord Melrose. You have a new telephone exchange here? Yes, it's been in for two days. A beastly nuisance changing your number like that. Now, since getting that new number have you given it to anyone? Given it? Not that I remember. Yes. I've given it to one person. At that beastly nightclub last night. I gave it to Bunny. Who did you give it to? - Bunny Manders. A nice young lad. I've known him all his life. He and his sister are spending the weekend here. Look here, you don't think that one of my guests is the ..? Oh no. No, no. No. That's purely a routine question. Please remember that. - Alright. Who is that strange man with George? I don't know. I met him only minutes ago and I didn't quite catch his name. My dear, a most extraordinary thing. A very old friend of mine has just happened to turn up. This is mister .. Cameron. Mister who? - Cameron, my dear. One of the Scottish Camerons, you know. He and I used to go deer-stalking. Deer-stalking? How do you do, Mr Cameron? It's a pity you didn't get here in time for the music. And George's snoring. My dear, you know I don't like music. Well, I don't like cricket. But I don't take a nap in the middle of the playing fields. Look after Mr Cameron. Yes, of course. Come along, Cameron. I want you to meet some of the others. If you don't mind at the moment I'd .. Like to have a smoke outside. Yes, of course. Enjoying a bit of air, Mr Raffles? Oh, it's you .. Cameron? Aye. It was good of you not to give me away just now before the others. Oh, not at all. No, I always believe in helping the police whenever I can. You know, I have a theory about the Cracksman. I believe he is a myth. Invented by Scotland Yard to cover up a multitude of, shall we say, failures. Ah, now you are being very hard on us, Mr Raffles. No. The Cracksman exists alright. I'm going to hook him one of these days. Play him and land him like a fish. Like a fish? Aye. I'm a fisherman, Mr Raffles. - Oh, yes. You still haven't told me why you're fishing in this quiet pool. I prefer not to divulge that. Well, in any event I doubt there is anything much for me to worry about. No. I think you can go about your business undisturbed. Thank you, Inspector. After those reassuring words .. I will. There you are, A.J. Mr Manders - Mr Cameron. How do you do. - How are you, Mr Manders? Fine, thank you. A beautiful spot, I'd call this. Yes it is. It reminds me of Stratford on Avon. Ever been down to any of the revivals? Yes, several times. I saw The Merchant Of Venice there a few seasons back. A student of Shakespeare, Cameron? As well as a .. Deer-stalker. Well, a lover of the theatre, Mr Raffles. You know, the finest performance of the Merchant of Venice I ever saw .. Was with Maud Holden as Portia. I imagine she was a bit before your time, Mr Manders. No, as a matter of fact Raffles and I saw her together. We went to her farewell performance when we were kids. Yes, she was magnificent. Whatever happened to her? Is she dead? No. No, I don't think so. In fact I heard of her the other day. Well if you see her, I wish you'd tell her she still has a faithful admirer. Yes. Two of them. Ah. Have a cigarette? No thanks. I don't smoke. Perhaps it's just as well. There doesn't seem to be any in it. Oh, Hiltons? Why, Raffles will have one of those. That's his favourite brand. Really? Yes, of course. There you are. - Thanks. Mr Raffles. Cricket has conquered music. They are all calling for you. Won't you come in and play lion? Excuse me. I just wanted to save you from that awful .. What does George call him, "deer-stalker"? Who is he? What is he? - Well .. You know something. Come on, tell me. Lady Melrose, I think it is most unfair the way they keep you in the dark. Yes. That man is a detective. - A detective? What on earth is a detective doing here? Well, he probably suspects an attempt on something. Your necklace, for instance. - My necklace? What nonsense. The ideas people get. Why it's just all those silly papers. - I agree. And I suppose you probably keep it in a safe? No. We have a safe here but .. That is the first place burglars look. I always keep my necklace in my bedroom. Oh. You think I shouldn't? Well I imagine if there is a detective in the house it's alright. He'd likely sleep outside your door all night. He will do no such thing. I shouldn't sleep a wink. - He has to be where the emeralds are. I will send them down to the safe and he can sleep here. Good .. and yet .. What? As you say, that's probably the first place a burglar would look. Just what I've always said. I shall keep them in my room. You will have the detective lying like a spaniel on your mat. Not on my mat. Well, you can't have it both ways. Or can you? Yes. I think I can. I've got an idea. Mr Raffles. I'm a very wily old woman. George. Yes, my dear? I'm going up to bed now. I want you to come up and get my jewel case and put it in the safe for me. What? Why, you've never done that before. Well, after all I've been hearing on the wireless about that amateur cracksman .. I thought perhaps I should. I doubted you would be so sensible. I'll be up in a minute. - Goodnight, Gwen. Goodnight, Lady Melrose. Goodnight. Forgive my going up won't you. George's cricket was so exhausting I am worn out. Sleep well. We will. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Deer-stalking indeed. I'll deer-stalk him. I beg your pardon, Milady? - Nothing. Put the milk down there. I think I will take a sleeping powder tonight. Do you think it wise, Milady? Wise? Why not? I don't know. I just thought .. - Nonsense, go and fetch it. What are you doing? - Leave the milk there. [ Door knocks ] Is that you, George? Just a minute. Come in. Here you are. You're a very sensible girl, my dear. - Glad you think so. So do I. Goodnight, my dear. - Goodnight. Nothing to worry about. - No. Why are you standing there, grinning? - Sorry, Milady. Got my sleeping powder? Yes, Milady. - Well, put it in. I hope I shall get off to sleep quickly tonight. Yes. I'm sure you will, Milady. Never used this safe. Except to keep the poker chips in. And Kitty's birth certificate. A lock of my hair as a baby. Well, that's that. When was this taken? Oh, that was taken last night at The Ambassador. Good one of my wife, isn't it. Now sit down, Cameron. How about a whiskey and soda? So Mr Raffles was with you last night? Yes, Gwen and Bunny brought him. We've never met him before. What a nice chap. Aye. I've no doubt he was the highlight of the occasion. And to come early to meet the guests and all that. Well no, as a matter of fact he was very late. For a while we though he wasn't coming at all. Is that so? Remember me? - Oh, Gwen. Everybody has turned in. We have the whole place to ourselves. I've never seen a warmer, kindlier moon. Does it meet with you approval? Yes, it is nice. Shall we walk to the brook? Gwen .. I've got .. What's the matter? I wish I could explain. There is so many things I want say and so many things I can't say. It is so bewildering. Have I done something? No, you've never been anything but sweet and wonderful. Even though there must be questions. Tumbling over each other in your mind. Questions that should be asked. But can't be answered. Very well then. I .. I won't ask them. Gwen, there is one thing you must know. One thing you must believe. Nothing matters to me except your happiness. How very considerate. Well. I don't suppose there is anything more to be said. Goodnight. Goodnight. Ah, Raffles. Everyone gone to bed? We've just been putting Kitty's necklace away. Now the only thing left to do is to put on the burglar alarm. Oh, you have a burglar alarm? Yes. One of these new electric-ray things. There are six bells and they ring all over the house. That must have quite a musical effect. Yes. And once the thing is set. If anyone tried putting as much as his toe through a window. I think we've taken every precaution. - It seems more than adequate to me. I'm just going to trot off to bed. Goodnight, Raffles. Goodnight, Cameron. Well, I'll say goodnight too. I'll come with you. Splendid. Splendid. Are you sleepy? - Aye. A bit. Are you? Yes. I'll probably read for a while before I turn in. I imagine your work leaves you pretty tired? It does. I can think of only one job as exciting as tracking down criminals as you do. What's that? Dodging you fellows. Goodnight, Inspector. Goodnight, Mr Raffles. Dear Mr Raffles. [ Burglar alarm bell ] A.J. A.J. What are you doing? Who are you? Look here. You can't do this to me. Help me! It's the burglar, I believe. Bunny! Crawshay, huh? Out of your depth here, aren't you. I ain't taken a thing, Guvnor. True, I ain't. Well, Inspector. You weren't far wrong. I congratulate you. I think we are both to be congratulated. He didn't get anything. Is this the "Cracksman" fellow? This? No. He looks a pretty slimy sort of an eel. I say, what about Kitty? I had quite forgotten all about her. Cameron, I am a little disappointed in your cracksman. This isn't the cracksman, Mr Raffles. Crawshay and I are old acquaintances. I've been responsible for several little holidays of his. That's too bad. Rather like fishing for salmon and catching a minnow, isn't it. The salmon is still in the stream, Mr Raffles. And patience is a virtue, Cameron. It's alright. Kitty is fast asleep. I am so glad she didn't wake up. Well come along. I think we'd all better toddle back to bed. Goodnight, Cameron. You are A.J. Raffles the cricketer, ain't you? Yes. A nice looking little ticker you got there. Well thank you. I hope you weren't looking at it professionally. Blokes like me, we have an eye for little things like that. Come on, Crawshay. How extraordinary. A.J. Come in. Hello Bunny. - You dressed early. Got to go to town on that business of yours. Now? What earthly excuse are you going to give to old Melrose? I'll take care of that at breakfast. Can I come to town with you? No. - Why not? I can't sit around here wondering all day. There is nothing to wonder about. It's all going to be alright. I'll have that money for you by dinner time. Are you sure? Just As sure as if it were in my pocket. What do you expect, sir? Not another attempt? I don't know. But something. That's why I sent for you, Merton. If Crawshay knows something I want to know too. But if the jewels are still in the safe? I know. It's a puzzle. Wait. Cameron. Are you still here? I thought your work was done. No, not yet, Mr Raffles. Not all of it. What did you do with your minnow? - Crawshay? He is in the village jail. - Oh. You are up early, Mr Raffles. - Yes. A lovely morning, isn't it. Had your breakfast? - No, I haven't. Aha. Here comes the saviour of the Melrose jewels. Three cheers for Scotland Yard. Good morning, Raffles. - Good morning, sir. Oh, kidneys. - I say, Raffles. What have you done to your hand? It's nothing. Just a little bruise I got yesterday. My dear boy, I do hope it's not serious. I don't think so. Can you give me some bacon, sir? But you are bowling for Middlesex tomorrow. It will be alright by then. Is that an egg in there? Yes. Look here, you may have bruised the bone or something. Why don't you run up to London and let old Spurgeon have a look at it? It's really nothing. It's a very important match, you know. Maybe I should go up. Dash up immediately after breakfast and get him to vet it for you. Yes. I think I will. Get my bags packed and send the car round to the front door. - Yes, sir. I hope you're not leaving me. George! George! That sounds like Kitty. What is it, my dear? I'm coming. I've been robbed. George, where are you? I've been robbed. My necklace, they've stolen it. Nonsense, my dear. Go back to bed. You're all undressed. Don't look at her. Don't be so silly. What does it matter what I look like. Don't you understand? My necklace has been stolen. Your necklace is in the safe. Don't you remember? You gave it to me. No, I did not. Kitty, those sleeping tablets have been too much. I'll go and get it and show you. - I gave you the case. The necklace is not there. I kept it in my room. What's that? Oh, you're still here, are you? A fine detective, you are. Letting them steal my necklace. A detective indeed. I believe it was you who stole it. Have him searched. - Lady Melrose. You mean that case you sent down to the safe last night was empty? Oh, so it's penetrated, has it? Who told you I was a detective? Do you think I don't know detective's feet when I see them? Oh, Mr Raffles. How right you were in everything you said. But why didn't you protect me? Where were you, Mr Raffles? Oh, where were you? Aye. Where were you, Mr Raffles? I, when? When the alarm went off. I was in my room, reading. Of course. Inspector. Inspector, look. The case is empty. The necklace was never in the safe at all. Of course not. I don't see what you wanted to go and look for. Well, I'll give a thousand pounds reward. A thousand pounds to anyone who returns the necklace to me. All your nonsense of safes and detectives and burglar alarms. Yes, Kitty. Now go back to bed, my dear. You are all upset. Gwen, will you be so kind as to .. Or kidnapped. Come along. See that nobody enters or leave the house. What's that, Inspector? I propose to examine everyone. You can't do that. I won't have my guests treated like that. I'd rather lose the necklace altogether. I'm afraid the matter is in my hands now, Lord Melrose. And you will not lose the necklace. Well I hope there is no objection my having my guests in the house. I don't think I'll be needing those now. That's right, isn't it? We're under arrest? Ah, I don't know. I think we might make an exception in your case. Oh, thank you. That's alright. You can put Mr Raffles' things in the car. Wait a minute. Are you sure you would not like to search them first or me? I don't think that will be necessary. - Alright. I am extremely grateful to you, Inspector. Tell Gwen I'll call her from London. - Alright, A.J. Good luck with the salmon fishing, Cameron. Aye. I'm thinking of trying new bait, Mr Raffles. Oh, splendid. But Lady Melrose whatever possessed you not to put the necklace in the safe? It was the way dear Mr Raffles talked. A.J.? When? - Last night. He agreed with me that the safe would be the first place a thief would go to. You mean he told you to keep it up here? - No. I told him I always did. Did he ask you? - Yes. He seemed quite concerned about it. Excuse me, Lady Melrose. I must speak to him. It wasn't his fault. It was all my fault I suppose. [ Car engine noise ] Are you letting him go? Yes. Get a fast car immediately. And this is what you do. Take that fellow Crawshay out of the village jail and get him to London. And when you do get him there, let him escape and then follow him. What? - Go on, don't argue. This isn't the first time I've set a thief to catch a thief. Filthy weather, Mr Raffles. Did you get my cricket bag and put the car away? Yes, sir. - Thanks. Oh, you're back, sir. A boring weekend, I take it. Not exactly boring, Barraclough. No. Any letters, any messages? Bills. All bills by the look of them. I'm afraid so, sir. Leave that. I want you to go out for me. I want you to go to the Airways Office in The Haymarket. And get me a seat on the evening plane for Amsterdam. Here is a tenner. Sorry to send you out in the rain, but be as quick as you can. [ Doorbell ] Excuse me, sir. Is Mr Raffles in? - Oh, Miss Manders. Gwen. Crawshay has escaped. Mackenzie let him escape. What? "Set a thief to catch a thief", he said. I see. Why did you do it? Whatever made you begin it all in the first place? Too long a story to tell you, darling. It's all so incredible, so fantastic. Maybe that was the reason. Well, thank you for coming to tell me about Crawshay. I didn't come for that. [ Doorbell ] Don't let them in. Don't let them in. Gwen, you shouldn't have come here. - They couldn't keep me away. It will be alright. It's alright. Wait. Come in here. [ Doorbell ] Ah, the fisherman. - Aye. - Come in. You must have exceeded the speed limit. I suppose police don't mind doing that. Aye, I have a good car. You have a good cloak too. Yes. It is useful cover in an emergency. That's worth remembering. What did the doctor say about your hand? I haven't been down to see him yet. I'll go along later on. Let me get you a drink. - No thanks. Do you mind if I help myself? No. Go ahead. Crawshay has escaped, Mr Raffles. Has he now? Well, that sounds rather careless of you, Inspector. He is here, in The Albany. Is he? I must look out for him. I am looking out for him. I've got the place surrounded. Then there is nothing to worry about. Except the necklace. I'll get that as soon as I've got Crawshay. Has he got it? No. But he knows who has. - Oh. Do you mind if I look around the rooms? For Crawshay? By all means. Thank you. - Do you mind if I read my letters? By all means. - Thank you. A nice vase you've got here. Yes. Not big enough for Crawshay to hide in though. Is this your bedroom? - Yes, allow me. After you. Is this the bathroom? Yes. Go in. I'm not bathing at the moment. And that other door? That's the spare room. May I see it? At the moment, it is occupied. Occupied? You don't say. By a lady. Her name is not Crawshay. Hmm. You can trust my discretion. How do you do, Inspector? Have glass of sherry, Gwen. Yes, thank you. That's a fine looking clock you have. Are you interested in clocks? Take a look at the works. An interesting specimen. I'll take your word for it. Are you sure you wouldn't like to see it? No thanks. I've seen all I came to see. And a bit more. Maybe I will have a drink with you after all. Splendid. Have a seat. Thank you. Do you mind a pipe? No, not at all. What's the matter? - I left my pouch. Is this pipe tobacco? - Yes. I don't think you'd care for that. Let me give you a cigar. I have something rather special. Thanks. I'll smoke this after dinner. Take another one for now. No, I'd rather have my pipe. Oh, my cigarette. Oh, I am so sorry. I hope you will find that alright. [ Doorbell ] Excuse me, I'm playing butler today. Mr Mackenzie? We've spotted Crawshay. He's on the roof. I'll come along. You had better leave someone outside Mr Raffles' door in case .. In case ..? Well, in case Crawshay tries breaking in that way. Oh. I want to give you every protection, Mr Raffles. Or in case Mr Raffles tries breaking out. What are you going to do? I don't know. - I do. Put your hands up. What do you want? - I want the sparklers. So hand over. Mr Crawshay, if I give you those jewels it won't do either of us any good. The police want both of us. They know you're here. Yes, I don't think. You ain't going to get away with no story like that. Either you hand over them sparklers or I blow the blooming daylights out of you. Alright, then. Go ahead and shoot. But do you know Crawshay what will happen to you? Have you ever heard a man condemned to death? I have. The murderer I saw clung to the dock-rail like a wet towel .. When the judge put on that black cap. It's not a cap exactly. It's a piece of silk or something. Just telling you this so you'll know. And while he does that there is a silence. You can hear your heart going like a piston at the bottom of your throat. You try to swallow. But you can't. That's when you feel the rope round your neck and the trap door under your feet. And then from a long way away. You will hear the judge's voice. Telling you that you are to be hanged by the neck. Until you are dead. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul. I'm sorry, Crawshay. I admit that wasn't very fair. Why, you .. That's what comes of listening to a bloke like you. I entirely agree with you. Now come on, we've got to get you out of here. Here is the rope, Inspector. That's how he went down. Pull it up! Got any money? - Nothing. Here's a fiver. It's my last but good luck. Look. Now go downstairs and get the pair of them. They've got me, Guvnor. They've got me. What am I going to do? That ledge. Down that pipe to the next ledge. That window leads to a passage. And then you're on your own. Sorry for the bad evening. You're a pal, Guvnor. Before you go do a pal a good turn. Know what that is? God love you, Guvnor. You're a pro. A real pro. Now for them. [ Door knocks ] Where is he? Mr Raffles? He's in his room. Of course I've got him. He's been put out with something. Where's Crawshay? He got away through the bathroom window. Mr Raffles. Mr Raffles, what's happened, sir? What is it? - Mr Raffles. Mr Raffles, sir. What's happening? Mr Raffles. What is it? Oh, Barraclough. Well, Inspector. Crawshay came alright. Aye, Mr Raffles. Crawshay came and went. Inspector. Inspector, we've got him. - Anything on him? Only a five-pound note. A five-pound note? Just a minute, sir. Don't stop me. I've been sent for. Gwen, my dear. What are you doing here? What you must do too, Lord Melrose. Trying to help Mr Raffles. You are too late, all of you. Confound it so. Well, Inspector. You got your man. Aye. We got him alright, Mr Raffles. Good. You can always depend on dear old Scotland Yard. Yes. Here is a warrant for your arrest. No! - What? You will have to explain your business in Amsterdam, Mr Raffles. My business in Amsterdam? Amsterdam is the jewel market of Europe. You are the Amateur Cracksman, aren't you Mr Raffles? Yes. Aye. Raffles. Well, there it is, Bunny. I'm sorry, but there it is. You still haven't got your necklace, Inspector. Lord Melrose. Do you remember the reward you offered? One thousand pounds to anybody that would return it. I don't need to be reminded. Bunny, could you use a thousand pounds? I'm sure you could. Now you just give the necklace back to Lord Melrose. You will find it in my tobacco jar. The tobacco jar? Well, I'll be .. Yes, I thought you would be. A.J. How could you have been such a fool? Supposing I did need the money? What is all this? I don't understand. I think I do. Now see here, Inspector. We've got these back. No need to go any further. And I don't want any scandal. Aye, you needn't worry. Your name is not on the warrant. Well Inspector, you got your necklace. I have. But you haven't got me. Here! Here, get after him! Go and get something to break down that door. [ Gunshot! ] Good heavens, he's killed himself. Gwen. Go on. Barraclough. The door. I can't stop. - No, hurry. Goodbye, Barraclough. Hurry Raffles. Hurry, sir. Good luck, darling. They'll nab him downstairs. I wonder. You see him? - No. - He's got away. You two men cover the side of the house. - Very good, sir. You get over there. You two follow me. We've the entire square surrounded, sir. - Good, good. Where did he go? Where did he go? Don't stand staring like that. But sir, but sir .. - What's the matter? You just went down that way, sir. That was him you fool. There he is. Where? "Meet me here at 7 o'clock." "Positively my farewell performance." Sir, it's a hoax to waste our time. I'm not so sure. You know, Merton. There is not much fun in life if you never trust anybody. And this Raffles fellow. Well, I don't altogether dislike him. I hope you're not making a mistake. I'll chance it. You may take your men away. I think I'd rather wait for Mr Raffles alone. Yes. Darling, you shouldn't have come. Suppose they're watching for you? I had to see you once more. Just for a moment. Yes. But supposing they f?nd you here? - Now don't you worry. I'm not worried. I love you. I know I said it before but I thought you may like to hear it again. 0h, darling. No matter what happens, we'll be together. Promise? I want you to stay, and yet. I want you to go. It so happens I've got to go. Where? Just round the corner. I have an appointment at 7 o'clock. I hate to keep anybody waiting but sometimes you have to. I understand. # s d ??
