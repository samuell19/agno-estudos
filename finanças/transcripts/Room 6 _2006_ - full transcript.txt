Where am I? What's happening? Hello? Hello, can you hear me? I can't move. I can't move, help me! Oh, my God, I'm awake. I should be under. I can't move, help me! Oh, my God, what are they doing? They have to hear me. They have to see I'm awake. They have to! Oh, God, I can feel that. I can feel what he's doing. No, I'm awake! Please, I'm awake! Don't! I'm awake, I'm awake! I have to get their attention. They have to know I'm wide awake! Thank you, Nurse Holiday. No, I'm awake! Please, I'm awake! Don't! No, I'm awake! Please I'm awake, don't! I'm about to make the first incision. No! Thank God. Thank God! Oh, my dear. We know you're awake. No, no... no! You could wake the dead with that scream. Maybe not the dead, but definitely the neighbors. It was so real. Let me guess, you were in the hospital again? Yeah. Something like that. Oh, no, no. Come to bed. Oh, why? It's morning. It's not morning, it's... Oh, it is morning. How cold? A 6. That's a 7 or an 8. What do you want, a cure for mornings like this? How's your morning? Black as my coffee. So, what's the cook in school today? Class 2-C, Melissa Norman, again. Oh, still not getting through to her? Fed Ex would have trouble getting through to that girl. How '&bout you? Ransik Building. See if we finally got something Dick likes. Listen, Ames, um, remember I had something I want to talk to you about? Well, now that we're in our new apartment and stuff... Well, just hurry up. I don't wanna be late for class, okay? It's important. I'm listening. It's huge actually. Real big stuff. Look, I told you last night, we need to talk. We're talking! No, I'm talking, you're not even listening! Sure, I am. Maybe this will get your attention. It's been 4 years. 4 great years. Well mostly great years. I mean, we had that one argument at Home Depot, but... Nick, I can't do this right now. Can we talk about it tonight? God damn it, Ames. I'm asking you to marry me. You're serious? Amy! Nick, I love you. Carpool's here! But I gotta go. Can we... can we pick up where we left off tonight? Just meet me at school at 3, okay? Right. So you know why I kept you here during play time, right, Melissa? You're having the bad dreams again. And these things are back? Monsters. Monsters, right. But only in your dreams, only when you're asleep, right? Hey, do you remember what we said? When you're dreaming, where are you really? Safe in bed. Safe in bed, right. So you just have to remember that. Is that how you do it with your bad dreams? Yeah. Did you ever wonder why you have your bad dreams? Did you ever wonder what you did to deserve them? Or do you know... do you even know what you did that was so terrible? Melissa, why did you just say that? Say what? Say that I did something... terrible. What are you talking about, Miss Roberts? C... can I go now? Yeah, of course. Melissa, you know I'm just trying to help you, with the dreams or anything else that might be bothering you. Like what? Excuse me, can I help you? I don't know. You seem to have your hands full trying to help my girl. Oh, you're Melissa's mother. I'm... I'm sorry, we haven't met yet. You've not been to any of the parent-teacher meetings. So sue me, sweet cheeks. Uh, we were just talking about, um, the picture Melissa drew in class today. Oh yeah? Just don't go filling her head with all that Dr. Phil and Oprahshit. The kid is weird enough as it is. I'm just trying to help. You can't help me. You can't even help yourself. You're not strong enough. I wish you could. You're nice... not like the others. You heard her. Butt out. The last thing me and Bob need is more hassle from Social Services. Hey... sorry about this morning. You just... caught me a little off-guard. Yeah, well, if you had known it was coming, I was afraid you would've run off. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know. Sometimes you can... be a little closed off. Aren't you supposed to be trying to be charming right now? I am charming. Freakin' Prince Charming. I'm the king of charming. I just don't get it, Ames. I mean... you love me. You know, I... I know you do. So why don't you wanna marry me? I didn't say that. This has to do with your father, right? That he's not around to walk you down the aisle... give you away? This has nothing to do with him. Of course. One mention of your dad and you get all closed off. What else is new? Nick, you know what? You don't know what you're talking about, so just stop it. I'm sorry. You know, I just love you so much. Oh, God. Nick... I think my leg is broken. It's okay. It's okay, I'm... let's get out. Oh, it's stuck! Help us! Please, somebody help us! Please! Please! Hello! Help! Somebody call 9-1-1! Please! It's okay. It's gonna be okay, babe. Okay. Oh! Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hey... Hey, I'm okay. I'm okay, but my boyfriend... his legs... he can't move. Stay there, I'll be right back. Where are you going? What are you... Oh, God. Stay in there. What the hell do they think I'm gonna do? Go for a fucking jog? Oh, it's okay, it's okay, baby! They're gonna get you out of here, and we're gonna be all right, all right? We're okay. Oh, I wrecked the hell out of the car, didn't I? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah, you sure do. Come on! Does this hurt? Gonna take you to the hospital now. All right? Wait! Amy! Sorry, lady. You're not allowed to ride in the ambulance. You gotta get to the hospital on your own. What? Those are the rules. I don't make 'em, you don't break 'em. What hospital are you taking him to? I'll meet you at the hospital, okay? Where's Ames? She'll meet you at the hospital later. What hospital are we going to? St. Rosemary's. I've never heard of it. We'll take good care of you. Ames hates hospitals. They give her nightmares. Ever since she was a little kid. A lot of people don't like hospitals. Not like Ames. She's the only person I know who can facilitate doctors to make house calls. Guess she's gonna have to go now, though. We'll see, won't we? I'm fine, I'm fine. It's my sister. Excuse me, how far is the nearest hospital? About 10 blocks. Can you take me there, please? Hey there, Norma. What have you got for me, Francis? Nicholas Van Dyke. I think he's busted up pretty bad. Don't you worry, Mr. Van Dyke. We're gonna take good care of you. You okay, lady? Yes, I'm fine. I just don't... I don't like hospitals. Oh, nobody does. Except them, uh, "hypocondoses" types. Hypochondriacs. Oh, them, too. I haven't been in a hospital since I was 12 years old. You're lucky. My wife breaks a sweat, I gotta take her to the emergency room. It's all right, Mr. Van Dyke. You're in the hospital now. Where's Amy? Oh, I'm sure she's on her way. You want I should go in with you and hold your hand? No, I'll be fine. It's too bad, 'cause I was gonna leave the meter running. Oh, darn. You have a good day now, Amy. Yeah, you, too. Hey, how did you know my name? I didn't tell you my name! Doc... Don't try to talk. We've given you some medication for the pain. Dr. Stamos to pediatrics. Dr. Stamos to pediatrics. Paging Dr. Alden. Dr. Alden to O.R. Paging Dr. Alden. Dr. Alden to O.R. I'm here to see my boyfriend. He was brought in a while ago. Brought in? When? I'm not exactly sure. Within the hour? What's his name? Nick Van Dyke. Mmm... I'm sorry. There must be some mistake. He's not here. It's been quiet. Who told you he was brought here? I just assumed. Um, are you sure? Nicholas Van Dyke. There was a car accident a few blocks from here. He had a badly broken leg. An ambulance took him away... Well, they sure as hell didn't bring him here. We haven't had an ambulance admission all day. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Look, do you know where they might have taken him if they didn't bring him here? This is a list of all the hospitals in the area. Maybe they brought him to one of them. And all the numbers are listed there, too. Maybe you wanna give 'em a call before you waste any more of your time. There's a pay phone right behind you. Thanks. Uh, you know, I think I'm just gonna use a phone outside. But thank you for your help. Thanks so much. Come on, Amy. Come on. Pull it together. It's just a hospital. It's where people get better. It's where they get saved. Lady. Lady, are you okay? Oh, my God. You were in the accident, too, right? Yeah. Well, are you... are you okay? I'm in better shape than my truck, but yeah, I'm okay. I'm Lucas, Lucas Dylan. But everybody calls me Luke. Hi, I'm Amy. Um, I'm so sorry. I don't... I don't have any insurance cards on me. Nick takes care of all of that stuff. Don't worry too much about that. I get into a car wreck, like, every few months. It gives me an excuse to get a new one. I've got it down to a science. I'm just trying to find my sister who was in the truck with me. Is she okay? They got her out, put her in an ambulance, and didn't tell me which hospital they took her to. Oh, my... the same thing happened with Nick, my boyfriend. It's crazy, right? I just got in a cab and told them to take me to the closest hospital, which was here. Same here. She was never even admitted. They must've taken them to a different hospital, but I don't even know where to start looking. Fantastic! We can take turns calling, save us a little time. Absolutely. I could really use the company. I'm still just rattled. I'm... You're not in shock, are you? No, I... I don't know. Maybe. I have a thing about hospitals. I loathe them myself. What do you say we start looking up these numbers, huh, Lucas? Absolutely. Lie back down. You need your rest. Van Dyke. Yeah. V-A-N D-Y-K-E. Yes, I'll hold. Are you sure? Well, maybe you could check again, please. Look, I was in a car accident with him, and his leg was injured very badly. The ambulance came, they took him out, they... they... they drove him away, they wouldn't let me go with him, they said that it was against the rules, okay? I... I checked every hospital in the area, and... and... and you're the last one on the list. It... It's like he disappeared! I mean, can you please tell me how that's possible? Is there anywhere else that they could've taken him. Anywhere... Well, fuck you very much! Excuse me. Oh, God! ...and he's with us now. Get away from her! Aah! Leave him! Look out! Look out! Okay. Okay, okay. Okay, that's... that's not possible. He's one lucky dude, I'll say. Luck?! Luck? That... that wasn't luck? Did you see his face? It wasn't... it wasn't human. It... it was... It was something else. Luke, I feel like I'm going crazy. No, it... it's okay. You're... you're worried. You've had a rough day. Anybody who's been through what you've been through today... No, I feel like I'm seeing things. You're not crazy. A few years ago, I worked at a hospital, and it's not unusual for people to... get a little more imaginative, shall we say, after a traumatic experience. Were you a doctor there? Oh, uh, no. I was just an orderly. Sorry. Or a nurse, as my friends used to like to joke. But I... I do know that I'm right about this. Hey do you... want me to take you back to your place? Make sure you get back safely? What do you say? No, um, I'm okay. I'll be fine. I'm... ... just gonna get home and, uh, wait until tomorrow. If I don't know where he is by tomorrow, I'm gonna go to the police. Okay. I'll keep looking tonight. If I find them, I'll call you. If not, I hope you don't mind if I go with you to the police. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Either way, they'll be fine. Go home. Get some sleep. Here we are, Nicholas. Home sweet home. Who's the new blood, nurse? That's Nicholas. He had an accident earlier. Dr. Kent said he's on the road to recovery. Especially with you looking after him. Too kind. Too kind, Mr. Brown. Oops. Pardon me. Just need a blood sample. But you guys already got some. Doesn't hurt to be sure. Always checking blood, this lot. Sometimes you'd swear it was more of a hobby than a job. That's enough of that, Mr. McHendrick. Don't make us put you back on sedation. Shit. Save some for me. Language, Mr. Van Dyke, please? We'll be back later for your sponge bath, Mr. Van Dyke. After all, cleanliness is next to godliness, now, isn't it? Hey! Hey! Listen to me. You don't wanna be here. Quiet, Harrison. I don't know about you guys, but I'm kind of looking forward to that sponge bath. No, no. This place ain't right. Ask Jamie here. Something's wrong here. How long you been here? I don't know. I can't remember. What are you being treated for? You don't know what you're being treated for? You were saying something, Mr. McHendrick? Nothing, Nurse Holiday. Good night, then. Good night, Nurse Holiday. Good night, Nurse Holiday! You have one new message. This is Sarah Norman, Melissa's mother. I guess I'm sorry to bother you at home and all that, but Melissa's been saying some things about you. She says she needs to see you and that she can help you. I hope you know what that means, '&cause I don't. Anyway, I'm just passing on the message so the little darling will leave me alone and go to sleep. Anyway, you know where we are. This is crazy. This is crazy. Oh, God. Hello? Anyone there? Harrison! James! Oh, God. Oh, God. It's okay, it's okay. You just had a bad dream, that's all. You don't have to wake up. Go back to sleep. Wakey, wakey, rise and shiny! What happened to the guy who was in that bed yesterday? He was discharged last night. All better! You discharged him in the middle of the night? Yes! He was all better. Better from what? Time for another blood sample, Mr. Van Dyke. But you guys took enough yesterday to stock a blood bank. And today is another day. Don't argue. Does no good to argue. House always wins, doesn't it? Don't argue, Mr. Brown. You know it does no good to argue. Your turn, Mr. Van Dyke. Save some for me, will ya? My stats are the same. Very amusing, Mr. Van Dyke. You're quite the merry prankster. What the hell is wrong with you? What... get your hands off of me! Get your hands... Excuse me, we'd like to report two missing persons. Uh-huh. Uh, one of them is named Nicholas Van Dyke. There was a car accident yesterday. I was in it too, but I... I wasn't hurt. Great, good for you. An ambulance came and took him away. Uh-huh. Excuse me a second. My sister and I were in the same accident. I luckily just walked away with a few bruises, but... But your sister got hurt and the ambulance came and took her away. Yeah, but they were different ambulances. Neither this young lady's boyfriend nor my sister were admitted to any local hospitals, so... So you figure that they were kidnapped, abducted. Something like that. You know what? We don't know that, okay? We were just... Were just wasting police time, right? What's wrong with you people? I got nothing better to do here? Huh? You think I got some kind of special overtime compensation for fielding these bullshit rogue ambulance stories? Is that it? Excuse me, two people are missing. There was a car accident, an ambulance took them away, we have no idea where they are... We're not accusing anybody of anything. We're not making this up. We're just looking to get some help, please. Jesus! That was pretty convincing. Seriously, that was the best I've seen yet. Bravo! Wait, lemme guess. They told you they were taking '&em to St. Rosemary's, right? They didn't tell us where they were taking them. They didn't say. No? That's a twist. That's a new one. Usually you people say they were taking '&em to St. Rosemary's. Hey, I got an idea. Just for shits and giggles, next time why don't you throw Bigfoot in there, too. Okay, you know what? I'd like to speak to your supervising officer right now. You know what? I want you to back away from my desk right goddamn now before I have you arrested for wasting my time. You understand? Come on, she's just being a bitch. Let it go. Leave him. He's with us now. What? What... what did you just say to me? What did you just say to me? Look... Easy, easy, easy! Did you see her face? Okay. You know what? I got a nice, cozy little cell all ready and waiting for you if that's the way you wanna play. It's no skin off my ass. You'll make some nice, new friends back there. You know what, officer, we're very sorry. We're just upset. Thank you. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. You... You didn't see... her face? You didn't... you didn't hear anything she said? No. Nothing. We have to make them understand and take us seriously. It's not really gonna work. You just saw what happened. They think we're pulling some kinda practical joke. Although, honestly, I'm not quite sure why. All right, well, you know what? What are we supposed to do... nothing? Just sit around, wait for Nick and your sister to come back, safe and sound? They'll call, okay? They will call just as soon as they can. They'll us what hospital they were taken to. We'll go and visit them. Everything will be fine. Amy, we just have to be patient. I can't do that. I... Well, we don't really have a choice here, do we? I'm sure this is a mix-up. Okay? They were admitted under different names, files were lost. It probably happens all the time. Hasn't it occurred to you that maybe they were too badly hurt to give their names? You know, that maybe they had a relapse on the way to the hospital and they're lying in a coma, or... or even... Stop. Stop, don't even say it. You've thought the same thing. You're just as scared as I am. Yes. I... I... I mean, I don't know... Amy, I choose to believe that they're fine. Okay? This is all one big mix-up. That's all. She's gonna call, she's gonna want me to bring her flowers and chocolates. Come here. Ghirardeli. Those are her favorite chocolates. That's what she's gonna want me to bring when I see her. You're probably right. Asshole. I... I'm gonna go... home, 'cause that's the number Nick would call. And I'll... I'll call you later though, okay? You promise? Yeah. Yeah, I just... I have to stop somewhere, but I'll... I'll talk to you tonight, okay? Won't do any good, you know. They'll never come! You can call 'em as many times as you like, but they will never come. Hey, what are you doing? No, don't let '&em see you doing that! Oh, no. Go back to bed. Stay here. Please. I'm gonna call my lady and let her know I'm all right. Then after that, I'm gonna call my lawyer and file a malpractice on these sons of bitches. What are you doing out of bed? I had to use the bathroom. You were given a bed pan. I saw something in there. It's just a supply closet, Mr. Van Dyke. Nothing of interest to you in there. Open that door. That's impossible. Now that's enough, Mr. Van Dyke. I'll have to insist that you return to your bed. You're in no physical state to be wandering around by yourself. You're on powerful drugs for the pain, but an occasional side effect can be hallucinations. That's all it is. I suggest you remember that. There's something wrong with this place. There's nothing wrong with this place, Mr. Van Dyke. It's a fine hospital. The finest. You don't wanna pay attention to these wild stories. What stories? You know perfectly well what stories. All lies. Vicious lies and scandal. I'm going to ask Dr. Kent to prescribe you something. Something to stop these episodes. What's she talking about, James? What stories? Shh! I'm talking to you! What stories? You have one new message. Hi Ames, I guess me being in the hospital has you pretty freaked out, huh? To tell you the truth, I'm a little freaked out here myself. Where are you? Uh... why haven't you visited me? Look, if you're scared, I understand, but I need you badly. I need you. Things are... weird here. I don't know, it's, uh, nurses taking blood. Just... I don't know, I'm scared, Ames. Really scared. Things aren't right here. There's patients going missing, discharged... Maybe... I don't know, maybe... maybe not. Shit. Ames, I gotta go. Mr. Van Dyke, what are you doing out of bed? Put that phone down immediately. No. Oh, God. You can't see him! No one can know! Oh, God. Aah! Who the hell are you? What do you want? Is this Amy Roberts? Yes, who is this? This is Sarah Norman, Melissa's mother. I called you and left you a message. I guess you just didn't feel the need to call me back. You figure some white trash mom wasn't worth your time. I'm sorry. It's been a rough couple of days. I don't care none about your sad tale of woe. You need to get your skinny white ass over here right now. Melissa's been spewing some weird shit and it's all your fault. She won't eat and she won't sleep. What? What is she saying? She's been saying she can help you find him. Now, I don't know what that means. I don't know, maybe I'm giving her too much sugar or something. She keeps saying it over and over again. Does this mean anything to you, sweet cheeks? I'm on my way. So, I'm here. Don't make it sound like charity. This is all your fault. Please, I really need Melissa's help. This here is Bob. This is the little brat's teacher from school. Yeah, that's nice. Don't you get up or nothing, you rude bastard? Jesus, Sarah. Hi. Hi. Huh. Little runt won't shut her trap. Been in there yammering all day about needing to talk to you about something. Now I don't know what you're teaching at their school. Maybe you should start with manners. Like respect your parents and shit. You ain't no parent, Bob. Yeah, not to Marsella. It's Melissa. Yeah, but I'll bet you dollars to donuts, I got a little girl floating around out there somewhere in this great nation of ours. I'll bet you do. Miss Roberts, Bob may not be much on the eyes, but he does have a way about him, wouldn't you say? Leave him. You cannot help him. We won't let you. Are you all right, honey? Maybe I should go talk to Melissa now, if that's okay. Yeah, you do that. If you need us, we'll be right out here. Right, sugar britches? Yeah. Stop that, Bob. You asshole, we've got company. Melissa... you awake? You're here. Your mom called. She said you needed to talk to me. You want to talk to me. You know the monsters are real now, don't you? Sometimes I think I see them, but I'm not sure. And now you can't find him. You don't know where he is. No. No, I don't. Do you? Yes. Where? Sweetie, where is he? St. Rosemary's. St. Rosemary's? I've heard that name before. You can find him if you really want. You've never told me why you are so very afraid of hospitals. I did something terrible once a long time ago. I've never talked about it. I never told anyone. Before this is over, I think you should. Time for your pills, Mr. Van Dyke. What are they for? To help you sleep, of course. Very good. What's the matter, my child? I don't know how to say this. I feel like I'm going crazy. Well, you can stay here as long as you need to. And I hope you find the peace you're looking for. Thank you. Hey, Father? Yes, child. I know I haven't tried this in a long time. I mean, not since my father... not since I was a little girl. And I'm just... I'm so scared and I'm confused and I... I don't understand what's happening to me. Amy... Are you all right, child? No. Please, if you'd like, I can get you into a rehab program we run here. It could prove very helpful for you. No. You can't help me. Only I can. Hey. Thanks for coming. You okay? Yeah, I will be. Um, I just... I need you to listen for a minute. Yeah, sure. Whatever you need. What do you want? Research. What are we researching? St. Rosemary's Hospital. May I ask why? A 10-year-old girl told me I should. Okay, makes sense. Excuse me, can you tell me where the local research section is? Upstairs. On the right. Great, thanks. You're welcome, Amy. Hello? We're looking for any information you might have about St. Rosemary's Hospital. My dear, why would you want to read about that dreadful place? It's a long story. What do you know? Just the usual. The place was destroyed years ago. Well, many years ago, before you were born. Blazed to the ground in a terrible fire they started. Who's they? The doctors... the nurses... the orderly's... The entire staff started it, some said. Why did they do it? Nobody knows for sure. But it was for something so terrible, they all chose to stay and die in the fire rather than escape. Back then, there were rumors, stories back from before the fire. Tales of sacrifices, devil worship, patients that would vanish and never be seen again. Blood rituals... to preserve eternal youth. And the rumors spread, and then one night, the whole building went up in flames. And nobody got out alive. Nobody? People came to see it and told how they could see into the fire, and how nobody even tried to escape, that they just sat down and waited to die. Waited for the flames to take them. A terrible cursed place, thankfully gone now, forever. I have to get home. Wait! Please, wait! My cats don't wait to get hungry, so I don't wait to feed them. What is it? I've seen these people before. They've been dead like, 60, 70 years. You couldn't have. I've seen them in my dreams. Thanks again for taking me home, Lucas. I don't know, I'm still a little bit freaked. What are you doing? Where are you going? I'm gonna head back to the hotel and check out. I should probably be heading back down south. You can't! What about your sister? I don't really have a choice. Okay, you know what? Just stay here. I'm gonna take a shower and... and we'll order food and sit down and discuss this, okay? Whatever you say, boss. Oh, God. Amy. Aah! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean to, but I heard you screaming. Sorry. Sorry. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. So, I think I know where Nick and your sister are, but I don't think you're gonna believe me. Where? St. Rosemary's Hospital. That can't be. It burned down, remember? Yeah, I know. I don't know how they're there, I just... I know that they are and that they need our help. You love him very much. Yeah. I do. My whole life, I've dreamed of meeting someone who loved me that much. You're so special. So special. I knew it the first time we met. And beautiful. When I saw you standing there in your bathroom, naked, I didn't just wanna comfort you. I wanted to hold you in my arms. I wanted to caress your breasts. I wanted to be inside of you. Lucas. Because you're even more beautiful on the inside than you are on the outside. Lucas, what are you doing? What I've wanted to do since the second I laid eyes on you. Lucas, I... Sorry, I can't. I can't do this. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Shh, shh, shh. Just close your eyes and forget. Lucas, I... I can't. Nick. Okay. Okay, I won't do anything. I promise. Just close your eyes. Lucas, I'm... I'm sorry. I love Nick. Okay, you just... you have to understand that. Nick is gone. What? He's gone. Where you can't help him. Lost forever... and you can't help him. You're too afraid to help him. He's gone. Leave him. He's lost you. After what happened to dear ol' dad? You know you can't help him. You were only 12 years old, but you remember it like it was yesterday, don't you? You'll never forget that day. I know I won't. The look on your daddy's face, the pain in your daddy's eyes... and that terrible thing you did. How could you forget? I promise you, he hasn't either. You remember the way he was before. No! Just leave me alone! Or the way he'd pick you up, swing you around, let you ride on his shoulders, take you to the park, and then his face. And that smell. That's the smell of death. That look of shame in his eyes. The regret. You remember what you did, Amy. To your own father, you remember what you did. I had no choice. Yes, you did. And you chose to become one of us. No, I didn't. You're one of us, Amy. Why can't you just admit that to yourself? Leave me alone! Ow. That hurt. Hello again, lady. Go. Go? Where do you wanna go? St. Rosemary's Hospital. St. Rosemary's. Thought you'd never ask. Sure that's where you wanna go, doll? Yes. Okay. Next stop, St. Rosemary's. What's happening here? No. No, what's happening? Oh dear, nurse. Yes, what a pity, Dr. Kent. Obviously delusional. Quite. I really don't think we have a choice, Nurse Holiday. Yes, Doctor, there really is only one choice. We're going to have to operate. We're here. Doesn't look like anything. Just wait. I can take you back home if you want. No. You can leave him if you want. No. If you go in there, you may not come back out. I don't care. I'd rather life inside there with Nick than life out here without him. Hey, wait. The little girl wanted me to ask you something. Melissa Norman? Yeah, if that's the name you got for her, sure. She wanted me to ask you why you were so spooked about hospitals. When I was 12, my father went into the hospital for a routine operation. Something went wrong with the anesthetic and... he was hurt. He suffered brain damage, he was crippled, bitter... Nothing like the father I loved so much. So what happened after? Something terrible. Where am I? What's happening? Hello? Hello, can you... can you hear me? Oh, I can't move. I can't move. Help me. Oh, my God, I'm awake. I should be under. I can't move. Oh, God, I can feel that. I can feel what they're doing. Oh, no. I have to get their attention. They have to know that I'm awake. Oh, they have to know. Thank you, Nurse Holiday. I'm awake! Okay. Okay, okay. Help us! Please, let us out! Please help us! Please, open this door and let us out! I'm looking for Nicholas Van Dyke. Open this door and we'll take you to him. He's in surgery. If I let you out, you'll take me to him, right? Yes, of course we will! Amy, you've got blood on your hands, too. Only you can't see it yet! Oh, God, no! Oh, God, no! Oh, God! Come on! Come on! Okay. Okay. Oh... Oh! No! Amy? Daddy? Amy? Daddy, is that you? Amy, it's me. Daddy! Hello, Amy. I've missed you so much. Oh, God, I've missed you, too. Don't be afraid. It's over now. I've been so afraid. It's over. We can go home now. I can protect you. It's over. No, wait. Nick. I said, you're coming home with me. No, I have to help Nick! How could you let this happen to me? Look what you did to me? Look at me. You like that, Amy? It was an accident. Yeah. An accident, yeah. You did this. You did this to me. Amy. Come on over and see daddy. Closer. Yeah. Hey. Closer. Oh God, Ames. It really hurts. It really hurts me. Daddy. Ames, listen to me. I want you to do something for daddy. Only you can do it. No, don't. Ames, baby. I'm not coming home. Pain's not gonna go away. Doesn't even let me sleep. I'm never gonna play again. Not like before. I'm trapped here, Ames. I'm stuck. This machine won't let me go. How can you grow up and go to college, marry, with me tethering you to this hospital? You'll be crippled, too. I want you to do this thing for me. I... I want you to set me free, Ames. You'll die! I'm already dead. This living is not alive. Not for a man like me. They can't help me. Nobody can help me. Only you. You can do this for me, Amy. I'm begging you to do it for me. For us. Do it, Ames. Don't do it, don't do it. Please don't make me do it. Yes. Do it. No, don't do it. Don't do it. Yes, Ames, yes. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! No! Daddy, daddy! Help! Oh, God. Daddy. Amy! Come back! You belong here. No! Oh, God, no. No! You belong with us. No. I don't belong here. Yes, you do. His blood is on your hands. You know that. You're one of us. No! You murdered your own father. Amy... Amy! Fuck you! Fuck me? I'd love to. The things I could do to you, the places I could take you, the places we could go together. So, what do you say we get out of these rather unfashionable clothes... Fuck... Come on! You can do better than that! Profanity is not very profane when it's used habitually. I have a feeling the more time we spend together, the more you're gonna get to like me. Don't you know where you are? This is where you belong. Tonight, the fire is going to consume you just as it consumed them. And then finally, you will be one of us... forever. Don't worry about Nick. The nurses will take good care of him, I promise. All right, let's get started, shall we? We still have time to get in 9 holes. I'm awake, please! I'm awake, don't! About to make the first incision. No! Thank God. Oh, my dear, we know you're awake. No, no, no! Stop! Stop this! Well, that's it, then. Looks like we won't have time to play golf after all. You're not gonna run? It is best if we stay here. This is where we belong. Oh, God. Okay. Okay, okay. Oh, baby, come on. Okay, okay. Oh! Oh! We can make it! Just go! Just leave me. Ames, go! Like hell! Come on, Nick! Come on! Don't run, Amy. You don't understand. Tonight the fire will consume you, and you will be one of us forever. This is where you belong. No, I don't! Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Ames. It was just... It was a test. It was all a test, wasn't it? Wh... what was a... what was a test? I love you, Nick. I love you so much. Always remember that, okay? I love you, too. Just... just hang in there. Just... just... it's gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. No. But it's okay. I'm not afraid. Ames, stay... stay with me. Stay with me. I can't. It's time for me to go. I passed the test. What? What are you talking about, "test"? I love you. Stay... stay with me. I can't. Could we get an ambulance over here? Who is she? I don't know. I thought her name was Melissa, but I was wrong. I think she watches over me. I love you. I would have married you. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. Not anymore. No. No. No. Oh...
