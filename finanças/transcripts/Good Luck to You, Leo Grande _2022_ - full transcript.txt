Ciao. - Bye. Hello! I'm Leo. You must be Nancy. That's right. May I come inside? - Yes, of course. Yes, of course. May I kiss you on the cheek? Yes, that would be fine. You smell wonderful. - Thank you. What is it? - Coco Chanel. Nigel la Lawson wears it. Ah, Nigel la. So sexy. Don't you agree? Yes, no, I... I was waiting for you to say, "for her age". Most people say, when a woman's over about 42, that she's sexy "for her age." I was waiting... I was waiting for that. Ah, right. Uh, no, Nigel la Lawson is empirically sexy, at any age. Hey, Nancy? - Yes? We're gonna have a great time. - OK. OK. I tell you what I'd love right now... What? - A drink. A drink, of course, of course. Sorry. What can I get you? How about a glass of fizz to ease us into the mood. A glass of fizz. Hold on. Allow me. For you. - Thanks very much. To being empirically sexy. Yes. I'll drink to that. A very fine vintage. It's just from the minibar. Oh, you meant me. Me. - I'm just teasing. Righto, righto. - Shall we sit? Yes, let's sit. So, what would you... - So, you enjoy music... by people? Yeah, I do. What kind of music do you like? Oh, I don't know. All sorts, um... Sorry, I'm a bit distracted cos, um... cos up close you really are very good-looking. Mm. - Thank you. Even more than in your photo. Ah, I'm better in 3D. Mm. I hope that you received, um... the contractual. Oh, the money? The money, yes, sorry. I didn't want to be crass and just say it. There's nothing crass about getting paid for your work, Nancy, trust me on that. And thank you, it's all received. Are you Irish? - Yes, I am. Have you been doing this long? A little while now, yeah. Long enough to know some things. Do you enjoy it? You know what? I love it, Nancy. Meeting all kinds of people, getting up to all sorts of things... mutual pleasure. You don't feel... demeaned then? Not at all. Or degraded? - No. But what if you meet someone and you really just... don't want to do it? Hasn't happened yet. Really? - Really. I find that astonishing. How many have you... - Oh, a gentleman never tells. Oh, of course, yes. You don't have to worry, Nancy. This is just about us tonight. So, what is your fantasy? Um... I'm not sure you could really class it as a fantasy as such. It's a bit mundane for that. OK, well, what would you most desire? I mean, desires are never mundane. Um... to have sex... tonight, um, with you. That's about it, really. For the moment. Great. - But do you mind? Do you want... I mean, am I... ...a disappointment, so to speak? OK? OK, OK. - Top-up? Yes, please. Thank you. I'm sorry, I just can't bear the suspense. Can... Could we... Would it be alright if we just did it now? Right now? And get it over with? Get it over with? - Yes. You're meant to enjoy it. No, I know that, I'm just not very good at waiting for things to happen. I'm much better when they've happened and I'm... recovering. You make it sound like it's an ordeal. It's not compulsory. Shall we just sit and chat for a bit? Oh no, I don't want to do that. I don't think we'd have very much in common. You might be surprised. - I am very rarely surprised. I like to plan things properly, specifically in order to avoid being surprised, if I'm honest. Fine, but I hope I can surprise you anyway. N... No, I don't want anything like that. Anything like what? You know, anything perverted. Oh, no, no, no. Not that kind of surprise. Oh good, I don't like anything going in to places that are designed for things to come out. You're talking about anal sex? I don't like that phrase. Nancy, I won't be doing anything you don't want me to do. I've never done anything like this before. I've never bought anybody like this for my own... Pleasure. - ...use. Nancy, listen to me. I choose to do this. - Yes. Right. You know, you haven't bought me, you've bought my service. I set a price and you agreed. I'm not being exploited. I can't bear the suspense. I can't bear it. The anticipation? - Yes... of disappointment. Why do you assume you'll be disappointed? Because I've always been disappointed before. I need to... Well, actually, I'd like to tell you something. OK. I've never had an orgasm. With a partner? - With anyone. Or by yourself? - No. Not even by myself. N... Never. That's right. Right. I see. It's not meant as a challenge. - I haven't taken it as one. Cos you won't be able to achieve it. - Fair enough. Your confidence is endearing, and no doubt necessary to the job but I feel I must warn you it is misplaced. Um, and I don't want you to feel bad about it because I won't be faking it. I don't do that. Not anymore. Um, I made a decision after my husband died never to fake an orgasm again. When did he die? Uh, two years ago. It was premature. And is this your first... Encounter since then? Yes. In fact, if we do this, you will... ...only be the second man I have ever had sex with in my entire life. There, I said it. Well, thank you for telling me. If you want to leave now, I'm very happy to pay half of what we agreed. I don't want to leave, Nancy. Nothing is making me want to leave. I won't leave unless I'm clearly instructed to or I feel I'm in physical danger. Has that ever happened? - Yeah. A couple of times. With a woman? - Yeah. Once with a woman. Well, her husband, he thought... He wanted a threesome. But it turned out he didn't. Did she? - No... but she did want to meet one-on-one a week later. And did you do that? - Sure. Wasn't that dishonest? - Of her? Of you. Why? I mean, I'm not the married one. I'm just doing my job. Wow. It's all quite an education. I hope it continues. You're being saucy. "Saucy"? My grandmother used to say the word "saucy". I'd rather not think about your grandmother right now if you don't mind. No problem. - I just... Anyway... I just wanted to let you know about the orgasm thing. I'm not expecting one, so um, you can relax. I am relaxed. This was a terrible idea. Do you feel you're somehow betraying your husband? His memory, I mean. What? Oh no, no, no, no, no. No, it's nothing like that. - Then what? It's just not very "me", I'm a teacher... Well, I was a teacher I... I used to set my pupils essays on the moral issues surrounding sex work and here I am... participating in it. - Nancy. You're probably a very vulnerable young man, maybe you're an orphan. I'm not an orphan. Yeah, or perhaps you grew up in care, you've got very low self-esteem. I didn't grow up in care. You could've been trafficked against your will, you can't tell just by looking at somebody. - I wasn't trafficked against my will. Well, then I simply don't understand it. - You don't understand what? Why you're doing this. Oh. Oh, well, if you really want to know I'm... I'm using the money I make doing this to save up for college. Oh. Oh, how wonderful. Are you really? No. Oh. Nancy, you need to stop worrying about me... ...let's move this back to you. OK. Oh, God. - Now, Nancy... This is crazy, it's terrible, it's wrong. - Nancy. My son... My son would be appalled. Nancy. - Yes. Let's go to bed. - OK. OK? OK. - Good. Come here. - Mm-hmm. Is this OK? OK? - Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Listen, er, if you, um, need to take anything that's fine by me. I'm fine, Nancy. I mean legal things, you know, to help... with it all down there. - No, I assure you, it all works. I know, I mean, I just... No, I know what you mean, but I don't need any little blue pills. Never? - Never. But what if you don't fancy the person? I mean, you can't force yourself, surely, if you don't. There's always something to fancy. No, there isn't. - There is. Oh. What's the oldest person you've ever done it with? That's a bit reductive, Nancy. "Reductive", that's a good word. I like it. Yes, it is a good word. I'm glad you like it. I chose it just for you. But seriously actually I really do want to know, how old? Eighty-two. - Eighty-two? Yes. - Eighty-two! Yeah. - Eighty-two. Nancy. OK, I'm feeling a bit better now. - OK. Um... So, what's the little thing about me that you can hold onto with all your might? To make you come alive in the moment? Come here. I like your mouth. I like the line of your neck, down to about here. And this... it's so elegant. Um, just... hang on a second. I'll just, um... I'll just go to the bathroom and change. OK, but don't change too much. Oh, God. Ta-dah. Ooh! You look great. Oh, um, everything OK? Yes, it's just, I don't like Mars bars. I can smell it. It's a bit off-putting. Oh, sorry, sorry. I'll go and clean my teeth. Would you mind? Thank you. What's this? Very nice. - I've changed my mind again. I don't want to do it. I'm sorry to have wasted your time. You... I'll still pay. But you can get dressed and go. This isn't about the Mars bar, is it? No, it's not about the Mars bar. Do you not find me attractive? Don't be ridiculous. You're clearly... aesthetically perfect, and apparently nice enough. What did you picture happening, I mean... why did you book me if you don't want to do it? I don't know at this point. A moment of madness, that's all. That's all. Do you regularly have moments of madness like this? No. Do you usually make rational decisions? Yes. Then why would this be any different? I mean, you must have had a reason. Something that made you do it. I bet you thought about it for days before. Weeks... Well, months. Years, perhaps. Well, then it's not a moment of madness. This is what you want, Nancy. And now that you have it, why won't you take it? Why won't you take what you want when it's right here, within reach. Oh, I don't know. It feels controversial suddenly. I don't find it controversial. To want something like this. Even to want it. If it's just sex you want aren't there a dozen men around who'd love to hook up with you? If it's all too much... I mean, surely they want to. Oh, yeah... Yes, they do, um... Yes, they made that very clear actually since Robert died but um, it's me, I don't want to. Why not? They're all old. Old men. I don't want an old man. I want a young one. A young body. And no of fence, I have to pay for that, of course I do. Well, I'm here, and I'm not offended. Actually, why are you still here? I've just offered to pay you to spend an evening doing whatever you please. Why are you still here? I'm interested. - In what? In you. - Oh, for Heaven's sakes no need to patronise me. - I'm not. You're conflicted. Conflicted is interesting. You've never met a woman who can't make up her mind before? I don't believe that. I've met women who can't decide which sandwich to have for lunch but if we've ended up in a bedroom together, they usually know what they want at that point. Well, young women are different. Yes, I think they are. Different to how we were... well, how I was when I was young. I wasn't actually a social renegade, anyway. A couple of my friends were, but we lost touch after school. But London was a different country back then. The rest of us were stuck in the 1950s, it was repressive. Sorry. And I wasn't brimming with sexual confidence like they all are now with their thigh-split dresses and salsa classes and whatnot. I mean, people do pole dancing for a hobby. I've read about it, I read an article about it. I mean, a hobby? Wh... I... Christ, I sound so old. I know I sound old, but Leo, did you ever meet anyone who does pole dancing for a hobby? I think that's mainly for posh girls. Yes, you're probably right. I mean, I know pole dancers but they wouldn't pay to do it. That's just some fucked up economics, do you know what I mean? Not really, but I mean, I can imagine. It's not a world I know much about. Says the woman who booked a hotel and a sex worker for the night. Oh, God. Oh, oh, you're right. Oh, God, I'm just a seedy old pervert. Just go. It's disgusting. I feel like Rolf Harris all of a sudden. Rolf Harris? Never mind. Come on, let's get in the bed. Let's get under the covers. Why do they make these things like... getting into a straight-jacket? It's ridiculous. What do you really want to do with your life? I'd like to see, er, Venus before I die. OK. I'm just curious about what it's like for you. You're clearly very bright. What makes you say that? Well, I'm a teacher, and I know there are some people who use the word "empirically" in a conversation, and there are very many who don't. And the clever ones are those that do. Did I use it? Yes. Nigel la. "Empirically sexy". And "reductive". Oh, yes, you're right. So I did. So, what, you don't think this is a job for clever people, is that it? No! No, no, I didn't mean that. No. No, I was just asking about qualifications and... Did you go to school? Of course. I mean, my mother was a very strict Irish Catholic. And what does she think about what you're doing now? You want to talk about my mother? Really? Well, you brought her up. - Well now I'm dropping it. But seriously... She doesn't know. You know, this looks so sexy on you. What does she think you do? If I tell you, can we drop it? Because you really do look good in this. I promise. She thinks I work on an oil rig. An oil rig? Yes, an oil rig. In the North Sea. No, but... But do... Do you keep in contact? Do you send her updates about life on the oil rig? - Now, Nancy, you promised. But how do you know what happens on an oil rig? I Google it, you know. I found a website where there's stories about life on an oil rig and I copy and paste them sometimes. Ha. That's amazing. What a life. Oh, dear. Meanwhile, my son's doing his Masters at university. Are you not happy about that? Oh, yes, no, I am, of course I'm happy. It's great. Why wouldn't I be happy? It's just what's expected. Why do you sound so ambivalent about it? "Ambivalent", that's another good word. - Mm-hmm. So... your son? Yes, well, I... I... I... Oh dear. I've never said this to anyone before, this is awful. It's OK, who am I going to tell? Come on. I... well, the truth is I find him boring. You find your own son boring? Yes. That's awful, isn't it? I've just never heard anyone say that before. Have you always found him boring? No, not always. No, he's a very nice boy. He's just very predictable, like his father. What's he studying? Chemistry. Please forget I said that. Just forget it, he's a lovely boy and I love him very much and I should be grateful because he's turned out very well. Any other kids? Mm. Daughter. Older. We don't get along. Oh, why not? She thinks I'm cold. And what do you think? I don't think I'm cold. I mean, I don't feel cold inside but maybe I'm cold with her because she's so over the top all the time. So the opposite to her brother. She lives in Barcelona, in this bohemian set-up. They're all artists, although I've never seen any actual art. Unless the art consists of burning your parents' money, which... Actually, it's not out of the question. At least she's not boring. No, no, there is that. There is that. So your children have disappointed you, Nancy. Yes. But when did you last see your mum? Why? Cos I'm interested in where you come from. I don't come from anywhere. You know, I was actually found under a little patch of mushrooms size of a bean, raised by friendly wolves. Oh, go on. Tell me something. I'm in awe of anyone who becomes a mother. Hardest job in the world. Did you get that off Mumsnet or something? Sorry? It's a bit general. Not all mothers are good. Well, I wouldn't know. I've only had one. Yeah, we're all stuck with whatever we get, aren't we? Parents and children alike. At least I know what mine are up to, though. Haven't you ever wondered if your son is lying to you about his life? No. - Why not? Maybe he doesn't want to disappoint you. Has he got a partner? Yes. Nice girl, also boring. Training to be a primary school teacher. Boring, boring, boring. I thought you said you were a schoolteacher? Yeah, but I was a Religious Education teacher in a secondary school. That's a very different beast to... colouring in with six-year-olds. They say primary education is the most important. Well, they're wrong. Do you know what proportion of secondary school students think that Religious Education is worth even an ounce of their time and attention? I mean, I... - No, well, exactly. Exactly. So there I would be, year after year spouting the same old stuff, unable to break away from the curriculum in case I got complaints from the head and unable to ask them anything real in case we lost time and just battling through the work and getting them through the exams and then you just start again the following year doing the same old stuff. It was just stultifying. I think I may have killed the mood. I'm not sure there was a mood. I'm sorry, that was rude of me. - No, it's true. No, but you're not paying for the truth, though. You're paying for a fantasy. At this moment, I'm not sure what I'm paying for. I can show you. I don't doubt it. What would get you back in the mood? Hmm? What would your husband do to get it all going again? Um... Well... He... He would, er... take all his clothes off, and lie in the bed without putting his pyjamas on. And I would take all my clothes off put my nightie on and lie in the bed next to him and then he would rub my shoulders and breasts a bit and then he would climb on top, do the business kiss my cheek, roll off, put his pyjamas on and go back to sleep. That's it? - That's it. Always? - Always. No deviation for 31 years. And that's the only sex you've ever had? Correct. Wow. "Wow" indeed. No oral? No oral. - Not even on him? No, he said it was demeaning. For you? - For him. OK... OK, and I presume it was the same for him on you? Yes, he said that was demeaning for him too. So, you've never had... No, I've never had. Never given. Do you want to? Yes, I do. I want to. I want to very much. I always have done. Sorry. I'm sorry to cry. It's stupid. I, um... I think that... Well, when I was a... a teenager my parents took me to Greece on holiday um, it was a once-in-a-lifetime trip, for them, anyway, and... um... at the hotel there was this waiter, I think he was about 20 and he looked at me like I was... the most delicious thing he'd ever seen and I felt my body go to water. And one night, he was hanging around after his shift and um, I was hot so I went out into the garden after my parents had gone to bed and he was there, smoking a cigarette and, um... I stood in front of this little bush covered in tiny pink flowers looking out to sea... and without a word, he came up and... ...kissed my neck and put his hand under my skirt and into my knickers and I could feel him sliding around down there and I was pushing myself back into him and it was the most crazy, exciting feeling I'd ever had and... and, um, then a car started up and the headlamps came on and he was startled so he dashed away. And the next day we went home. And I wished we'd just stayed one more day. Hello. - Hello again. Thank you. This is a very nice surprise. Is it? It's the same room. I mean, I booked the same room cos I didn't want to be thrown by a new layout. Oh, no, I mean you booking me again. Oh. - I mean, you must've been satisfied the last time, so I'm happy about that. Yes, yes, I was satisfied. Yes. But? But? Oh, it sounded like there was going to be a "but". No, no, not particularly. I, um, I've got a little bit of feedback and a couple of attainment goals for this time. Right, I see. Sure. OK. Would you like a drink? - Yeah. That sounds great. Cheers. So, I've made a list of things that I'd like to get through. Oh, that sounds sexy. Don't mock me. I'm a teacher. Old habits die hard. What's first on the list? Number one: I perform oral sex on you. Number two: you perform oral sex on me. Number three: we do a "69" if that's what it's still called. Uh, I don't know. Um, four: me on top. - Doggy-style. Well, that all sounds very achievable. Oh, does it? Oh, good. Good, cos I'm... I have no frame of reference. I've tried, um, looking on the internet, but it's alarming, frankly. I mean, if you type in "classy porn" to Google up pop 12 windows of erections. I mean, there's no build-up at all. Have I booked enough time? You want to do it all today? Yes, if possible. I mean, it's just, you're quite expensive and I'm not sure if I'll be able to afford another session after this. OK. OK. I understand, um... Isn't there something else that should be on that list? Like what? Well, I'd love for you to feel completely satisfied... if at all possible. Oh. Oh. The big "o", in fact. Yes. No, I like a list that can be fully ticked-off. Achievable goals. That's the path to happiness, there's no point in wishing for the moon. Well, it's an orgasm, you know, it's not a Fabergé egg. People have them every day. Right. Do you know what, you're right. That all makes sense. I just... I want to feel a sense of achievement. Yes. - I don't want to walk away... from this feeling unresolved. May I? Do you know what? We'll do as much of this as we can today. I think we'll certainly make a significant dent in it. Good. That's good. Good. You want to start with the blow job? Yes, I think so. Get the big one out the way first. Should I kneel? Well, I could stand on a chair, but that's not how it's usually done. Mm-hmm. You don't have to do any of this. No, I know, I... but I want to be a woman of the world. I mean, there are nuns out there with more sexual experience than me. It's embarrassing. Do you want me to brush my teeth? What? No. Nancy, you can just... you can just let go. Let go? What am I letting go of, exactly? I mean, we need some sort of plan, don't we? I don't want to swing from the chandeliers and make loud animal noises. I'd like to see that. You're letting go of the thing inside that grips you. You know, that judges you. That watches you from the outside. Christ, if I let go of that, anything might happen. That's the only thing keeping my life together. Keeping it ticking along... Here? Over here. What am I just supposed to do? Just float around like some sort of free form jellyfish you know, waiting for something to come up? No, but you're... - Do I undo your belt? Do you undo it? What's normal? Well, it's more a matter of... - Well, I'll do it. OK. No, I just... I just want to do a blow job. I want to get that sorted and then we can work through as much of the rest of the list as we can in the allotted time. - Like we've got a double lesson timetabled for oral, and then we can see what's left of the afternoon? Exactly. - And shall I ring a bell at the end of the session? Do you use a bell? You didn't last time. Oh. Very funny. Um... Oh... Sorry. I'll be back to all this in just a second. Hi, darling. Hi. Sorry about that. - Everything OK? Yes. My daughter. She's just in a bit of a pickle at the moment, shall we say. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, it's not the first time, won't be the last. She used to ring her father about all this, but anyway... Um, shall we just try and get through what we can? Before the exam? - Um, yes. Nancy. There is no exam. It's all a dance. I don't know the steps. An improvised dance, we just go where it takes us. There's no timetable, there's no bell. But I've only paid for two hours. Well, then let's enjoy them. Every single minute. OK, come on then. Do you want to start with the blow job or go with something else on the list? No, I think I'd like to go in order. I feel like I'm prepared for the blow job now. Robert, my husband, he never... he never wanted to try anything new. He planned everything, I mean, even his own funeral, actually. I was terrified he'd turn up on the day and tell me I'd put the wrong ham in the sandwiches. It wasn't a... furnace of passion that burnt out our relationship, it was more like, um... the bottom drawer of an AGA. A what? Um, it's an old-fashioned stove. You can't turn it off. It keeps on chugging away, and at the bottom there's a kind of cooler drawer thing that you can push things to the back of... Mm. - ...you know, to cook them slowly like a bowl of stewed apples or something. I see. - Do you? Er, not really. But, um, I think you mean your marriage stewed slowly because you pushed it to the back. And then forgot about it. Mm. - Mm. Well, anyway. He's gone, it's all gone. Ancient history. And I want to try something new. Then, good. So, I need to get that blow job under my belt. Your belt, obviously. OK. OK? OK, OK, look. I have an idea. You like dancing, right? Only when nobody's watching. OK, well then we're gonna change the mood. I'm gonna put on some music and you're gonna dance like nobody is watching. Come on, Nancy Stokes. Come have a dance with me. Oh, shit. Oh, God, God. That'll be my daughter again. She always rings twice. She always forgets the most crucial bit of information and has to ring back. OK. - I don't want to answer it. Then don't. - But I always answer it. Even when you don't want to? Yeah, especially when I don't want to. - OK. Well, what am I gonna say? "Hello darling, I'm sorry I can't talk now cos I've booked this man for the night and I'm trying to work up the courage to perform oral sex on him". Well, you don't have to say that. Shall I answer it? "Hello, darling. I'm sorry but your mother has something in her mouth right now." Shh! - "I could take your message if you would like." Listen, darling, I... Yes. Oh, did he? Oh, God. Yes. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, I am so sorry, yes, I do understand. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Listen, darling, I really do... Pamela? Pamela? Oh, she's gone. Just like that? No goodbye? Well, either her battery ran out or she's been abducted. Is it serious? Her pickle? Well, it can be sorted, that's the main thing. I see. Matthew will provide the grandchildren, I've no doubt of that. If Pamela can just keep herself alive, I'll be happy. You don't sound very happy. Well, it's very stressful being a parent, Leo. It's a stress that never leaves you it's... it's like a thumb on a bruise. Sometimes my children feel like a dead weight around my neck. I'm not sure I'd have done it if I'd known. What do you mean? I mean, I could've done many other things, if I hadn't been a mother. What else would you have done? - I dunno. Crossed the desert on a horse... started an artists' colony on a hot little island... had a... had an orgasm... Would you find a massage patronising at this point? No. No, I wouldn't. Do you think your kids could feel it? Your disappointment in them? I don't know Leo. I doubt it. They mostly didn't notice me, I think. I mean, do you notice when your mother's disappointed? Are you worried that she'd be disappointed if she knew what you do? I'm not sure what you mean. There's nothing disappointing about an oil rig, ma'am. Anyway, there's still time for you. Oh, that's sweet, but there isn't. This is it. My final attempt at a life. For the orgasm, I mean. You might have to abandon riding a horse across the desert. Can I ask you to do something for me? Mm-hmm. Would you mind taking your shirt off? Sure. OK. Can I touch you, for a moment? You're just so... I never thought I... Can I touch your shoulders? Yes. And your arms? Yes. And your chest? Yes. Oh. Put that back on then. You want me to put it back on? Yes, if you want to. I thought things were progressing quite nicely. I was suddenly overwhelmed. By what? Some wave, something of... Lust. Maybe. Sorry, I just feel a bit sick, actually. Tiny bit faint. - Put your head between your legs. I can do that on my own time. I'll just, just, um... maybe step away for a moment. Catch my breath. Have a drink. It's just, I, er... I've never felt anyone like you before. Like me? - Yeah, muscular, fit. Like a model. I work out. I'm sure you do. - I work hard. Don't you ever feel sometimes it's a bit shallow? Yes. But my clients like it, you know. And I like being wanted by them. When I'm here with you, being looked at by you, I feel good. God, I can barely imagine that. Come here and stand with me. I've always been ashamed of myself. My body, I mean. Always? - Mm. Always been aware of what's wrong with it. You know, stubby thighs, fat tummy... boobs come down to my naval now, my arms wobble... they have done since I was 20, actually... and if I didn't pluck here and here I could join a circus after a month. Oh, I've plucked it. - Mm. Don't be fooled by the muscles, Nancy. I sometimes feel ashamed too. That's hard to imagine. Well, if I didn't look like this you might not have chosen me, or wanted me.
