Mm. Hm. - Yeah, it's lazy. - It's not lazy, it just... it just doesn't work. - Mhm. - That's so pedestrian, - the whole thing. - Yeah. It sort of just reminds me of like a basic primary color wheel, frankly. - In a hotel. - It is the problem. The background needs more complexity and... It's just... it's leaving me cold. It's not... I don't know anything about the artist, I don't... - Yeah, yeah. - Peter made that comment last month about controlling competing forms in order to head off awkward readings and she's done that by stripping away everything interesting. - I'm... I'm done. - Yeah. It's making me a little bit angry. - I can see that. - Yeah, yeah. - I think that's all for now. - That's all we have to say. You know, better luck next time. - Any questions for us? - No. I don't have any questions, thank you. No, no, no, whoa! Okay, so maybe I'm not an artist. Maybe I'm just the daughter of two other artists. - What? - You don't need to know... Frances, will you get in here please? My father started drawing animals in the style of Albrecht Dürer, then he drew flowers for a vintage poster company, and finally trained as a medical illustrator. He's illustrated 16 technical textbooks. Then you tell him to draw his own fucking mitochondria. Fuck! But all he really wants is to draw an owl as convincing as Albrecht Dürer's. My mother designs upholstery textiles for three-story Connecticut mansions but lives in a one-bedroom Manhattan apartment where she sleeps with my father on a pull-out sofa bed. Maybe success isn't really an option for any of us. My family's apartment looks like a Mondrian of claustrophobia. My parents' sofa bed is the red rectangle, my sister and my old bunk beds are the blue rectangle, and the fire escape is the yellow, which is the only rectangle where anybody can breathe. Ah-ha. Hey, hi. Fran, I've had such a crazy day. - Yeah, me too. - Come here. Aren't you supposed to be at Robert's? - Yes. - Well, what are you doing home? Did something happen? We broke up. Mh, I'm sorry. Your mother's driving me crazy. Levi, don't talk about me! - Really crazy. - Hey, Dad. What happened to you? That's a really nice way to say hello to somebody. I thought you were at Robert's lake house. Yeah, well, when you break up with someone, it's not really very fun to go swimming with them anymore. What, he dumped you? - How was your time? - They broke up. - And look at this here. - He dumped you? Why is that the assumption here with both of you right away? I assumed that you dumped him. That's kind, thank you, Gaby. - You knew about this? - Ow, ow, hey, fuck! Just relax, your energy is... You can't live in this apartment anymore. - Now what are you gonna do? - Well, actually I'm still waiting on the Tokyo residency, so... Well, I told you you should've done that from the beginning, you know? Can you get out of the way, please? There isn't anywhere for me to go. - Go over here, I mean. - Stop it, don't move. - What is that? - Me? - You have a leech. - No. You have a leech, you have a leech, come, come. Come here, all right, go right to the sink. What did I tell you about that lake? That's disgusting. Tokyo will never work out, Fran. Levi, stop being so hard on Frances. All right, all right, forget I said anything. - Get the blanket, please. - What's gonna happen? Someone should sleep on this thing. - Yeah. - You wanna do it, do it. Oh! I'm feeling mildly optimistic, Fran. I'm sure Tokyo will work out. Okay. Oh, Frances, they picked the nicest tush in New York. You're done, beauty. You can pull them up. - What did I tell you? - So sorry, hon. Yeah, well, you wanna see something really tragic? Look at this piece of crap. - Oh, did you draw that? - Did I dr... Of course I didn't draw that, how can you even fucking think that? It looks like a fucking rigatoni. I should never have suggested it. Well, here, here, let me show you. This is mine. - It's gorgeous. - What is that? What do you have on your hand? - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Oh my God. - What's going on? Mirela? - He asked you? - He did. - What's going on? - Oh my God. I'm engaged! I am engaged. To Scott Glenny. We were on the Staten Island Ferry to go meet up with his parents for dinner. And I was kind of posing like the Statue of Liberty, just like as a joke, and I turn around and he had this little box out and he just asked. And we're getting married. Well, that's good because your mother and I are separating. - What? - It's good, because you'll be out of the house... well, actually, there won't be a house, and, Frances, the same goes for you. - Levi! - Well... - Mom? - You know, the cat's out. - Mom? - Congratulations. Where are they gonna go? I can't really tell how much of a plan there is, more than all of the feelings. I didn't think they were actually gonna do it, Fran. I bet there was a time where he really blew her away. Do you... do you think that love can last? Fran? Yeah, and how is Scott Glenny gonna support her? She's in law school, Dad, she's gonna support herself. Yeah, well, she clearly doesn't see his essence. Scott Glenny is a schmuck. Okay? I know about this and I know how it's gonna end. Man, I've missed this place. Yeah, it's gonna be nice having you here this summer. Oh, and look, this whole wall, that's all for you. It's very nice light. Well, it... well, you know. We'll adjust. There we go, we'll move it... we'll just move it a little. Okay, I don't need my bed yet. What? Our bed. I'm gonna be staying in the studio for a little while. Which side do you want? - Norway. - Norway? Actual Norway? Well, it's not exactly Tokyo, but... it doesn't sound so bad. Norway is not the problem. What is the problem? - Nils Auermann. - Nils Auermann. I thought he was dead. Only to the people that matter. He just fired his last assistant, now he needs someone to paint a barn using only the color yellow. Okay, that's fine. I would just like to get out of here. Do you think I'll have time to do my own work in Oslo... Not Oslo, Lofoten. Lofoten. Islands in the far north. How far north? Mr. Auermann? - I'm Frances. - Nils. Hey, thank you. I'm so happy to meet you. I'm very eager to see what you've done in this project so far. Everyone here seems really friendly. It's so beautiful, it's almost like a bad painting. What I mean is... is that it's so beautiful, that it looks like a painting that you would make... Not you, but... certainly not you at all. But if you tried to make a painting of it, it would almost be like cheesy? So magical that the sun never sets. The light is astounding. Oh, look at that. I have never seen a landscape so powerful. Yet you've never really done landscapes, and I also just wanna say I loved your early work. It's like everything is such a... Such a miracle to have so many different colors, I would want to write them down. I really would, because it seems like they're... Don't step in the middle. The wood is rotten. What's with all the trash? It's not trash, I recycle. Toilet. Shower. Clean bedsheets, towels. The rest of the house is off limits. Understand? Yes. It used to be an old fish factory, now it's for artists. - How many artists live here? - Me. So... this is yours. Sleeping, cooking, everything you need. - Well... - It's an honor to be here. It's an honor to be here with you! Nils Auermann's work has been called the same bad names as mine: lazy, cold, not working. So this is where you go when you're exiled. To the edge of the earth. You go to Arctic detention. To some buried asleep in the sun detention. Ugh. We're leaving in ten minutes! Hi, um, sorry, that trailer of yours could really use some thicker curtains. Please do not ask me about the sleeping, okay? It's very bright at night for sleeping. Can you work? I can. - What? - The Viking Museum. Oh, okay, here we go. Your official title will be apprentice. It's amazing to be your apprentice. Do not use... do not.. Do not use the word "amazing", okay? This is just hard work, you're gonna hate it. Cool. So you will be responsible for the interior. You can use this wall as an example, okay? Here you have buckets, also with numbers. So use that bucket for that beam and so on, okay? - Yeah. - You got that? - Mhm. - Good. I will do the exterior. In one month the piece will be inspected by NKI, that's the Norwegian Art Institute. If they like the piece, they put me on the map. - Put ya on the map. - Yeah, they put me on the map. Oh, like an actual map. I need you to paint full time. I'd like to do a little of my own work this summer. Not what I hired you for. Well, it's what I came here for. Look, this is not some kind of residency, okay? From seven to seven, we work. Is there a place where I can paint at eight? Nils' project was essentially a giant color-by-numbers. It was a coloring book and I, of course, was always more of a finger painter. So this would be Nils' work and Nils' battle, not mine. Fine, I can be a soldier. Hi. Go that way. Go down, go down. Oh, and the light must be beautiful all the time. It is constant all the time. And are you lonely? I'm closed for business. You're very attractive to men. That's not even a useful statement. Oh, come on, enjoy yourself. - Really? - This is when your body - is really at its best. - This is not what I want - to talk about. - Don't shy away from that, Fran. I want you to feel good about yourself. You look like you've changed a little. What are you eating, you look very thin. I eat a lot of brown cheese, and you put it on a little... like a cracker, like a... - That sounds so unappealing. - It's just what it is. A kitten named "Rambo" rescued another kitten on a farm near Tangstad. - That's what it says? - Yeah. His name is Rambo. What is that? Yeah, yeah, that's super fine. Thanks for the wine. Fuck. - Can we pick him up? - Pick who up? - The... - You're severely behind today's work, you're a disaster. You know, we can go to town for supplies later. Tonight, I'm cooking the secret recipe of my mother. Good for you. You may join me in the upstairs kitchen. Oh, wow! Sarcasm doesn't suit you. Oh! Hi. You work in here? She looked like the all-powerful angel who ruled the Renaissance and she lived in the most wide-open place I'd ever imagined or been to. But somehow, she worked in a black cube as cramped as my father's studio. Did she feel like she was in detention too? Or maybe I was just seeing it that way because I was looking for a partner in punishment. You have the wrong cheese. This one is wrong. How is that wrong? I want the green milk, yeah. I wouldn't be close to finishing this in time if you weren't here, you know. Yeah, that's right, you wouldn't. Can you tell me a little bit about your work in New York? Wrong. Beautiful colors. Sorry, just English. Oh, you're the New Yorker? I must be. That's a big barn to paint in a short time. - Yeah. - I've been excited to meet you. - Haldor says... - Haldor says what? This is Haldor, he plays the chief. - I am the chief. - Sorry. Where are you from? Cincinnati. And you prefer life as a Viking? Well, I can tell by your attitude you wouldn't understand. What is this here? - What is it? - That's urine. - Gosh, it really is. - The Vikings used this mushroom mix as tinder when it's dry. Ah, I see. Have you inspected our grounds? They're quite remarkable. It's a relief to be inside of a place that really knows what it is. Like, there's a lot of, um, there's a lot of here, here. A place? This is history. Oh, I'm... thank you so much. See you. I am the chief. - Sorry. - I've devoted my life to all this. I don't call you Chuck. Haldor looked like the Dutch postmen who are more beard than face. Sigbjorn looked like a newborn baby. I wanted to tell him, at least, the words I had learned. This project is too important to just walk away like that. You have to learn to take your art seriously, Frances. The museum is just there, okay? It's a neighbor. I cannot afford to find you over there. This barn is like a cathedral to me. If you cannot respect that simple premise then... No, no, no, this is not how I showed you! Follow the grain! I am following the grain. Minor painter, you have buckets, you have numbers. An idiot could do this. - You have to taper. - I'm tapering. You're not tapering, okay? Come on. - Ow! - This is tapering. - Let go, let go! - You are not following - clear directions. - Don't touch me! I don't care, do not touch me ever. Where are you going? Out. I'm done. Uhh... Uh, may I have the blueberry one? Next. - Uh, one pancake. - Toppings? - No. - Okay. Are you from around here? Do I know you? What? Oh, I'm sorry. He looked like Caravaggio's Boy with a Basket of Fruit. Heavy eyes, heavy arms just no fruit. You know, you and I are opposites, Frances. I'm not used to people. Especially not teaching. But you know, we complement one another. My orange to your blue. Blue and orange are complementary colors. If you look at something orange, a piece of paper for like 15 seconds and then look at a white paper, your eye makes blue. It's the same with yellow and violet. I use yellow and red when I want violet, you know? So it is living. It is living. At this rate, we definitely make our schedule. Your schedule is for wimps, I'm gonna finish this one a week early. - What? - It's the accent. - What... - I cook you anything you like. No more brown cheese. Okay. Stop. Stop. - We need to work. - I have to see something, but I'll be right behind you. Hey there. Hey. Hello? I think I realized where I met you. I'm pretty good with faces, I'd say, and I'm feeling very confident that you sold me a sandwich in Brooklyn. I doubt it. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? I'm painting a barn. Oh, I see the two of you have met. Who is this lovely person? He's here because he understands the... the real value of a Viking funeral for his father. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I didn't realize. - Yeah. - Perhaps Frances can help us with your father's ceremony. No, she doesn't need to help. Well, we're all here to help in any way. Also, another member of your party has just arrived. There are no other members. Was your father Norwegian? No, he was Russian. Just wanted to die here. I mean, he... he wanted to rest here. These all go back. You're at the wrong funeral. I wish that were true. The family of the deceased isn't expecting any more guests. Okay? You're such a strong man. How high can you jump? Pretty, uh... pretty high. Show me. Bravo. Go tell my son I am here. His name is Yakov. I think your dad is going to find it to be really quite peaceful all the way up here. It's a really nice place to be. - To be? - Mm. Yeah. Thanks. Have you seen the rest of this museum? There's more? So what brings you all the way up here? Can't really be a barn. It's mostly the barn. And a breakup. And my sister getting married to a man that my parents hate and my parents splitting up. So just general mess. So painting is an escape mechanism. No. Painting is focus. I think the love stuff was an escape from the painting. I get that. I'm sorry about your dad. I'm sorry about your mess. Yakov. Listen. - Yes? - Uh, could you please... What? What is it? Your mother. You froze him? No, I chilled him. Vassily Grigoriev. His heart went out. He's free. Here lies a free, dead man. Let us go. His eyes fell somewhere new on the blue spectrum, a kind of alien, cosmos, deep sea, gas flame blue I'd never seen before. I asked him what he did. He'd grown up working in his father's bakery. Every day, he'd woken up earlier and completed more craft than any artist I'd ever met. He knew what he was doing. His work was his calling. I envied that. He said his father had raised him, first in Russia, then in Brighton Beach. They'd waited ten years for his mother to join them and she never did. He said that losing his father was like losing his own life. Hi. I would like to paint you. Okay. - Really? - Let's go. Maybe we start by the bed? So... okay... - On the bed? - Yeah. Not now, after. Hey! Shh! Not now. Vassily Andreyevich Grigoriev asked to be given to the top of the world after death. "Then spake Gangleri, 'Shall any of the gods live then, or shall there be then any earth...'" - Haldor, could we just... - "'or heaven...'" - Please, allow me. - What are you doing? I'm actually the only Norwegian person here. You are the person to play the flute. - And you are a tour guide. - My dad... My dad was the only family I ever had. It was good to be with him. I lived with him for my whole life and I worked with him as long as I can remember. He was a baker. And his favorite bagel was the sesame bagel. He was made of peace. And it's good that we're here, giving him what he wanted. Which was to find more peace. I thank you for that. That's all I wanted to say. There is a Hebrew prayer we should say. I learned it from my father's funeral. I do not remember how to say it. - You say "amen" now. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Being next to Yasha in his moment of total feeling, I could see us there inside of an image of loss, an image I hadn't painted. One that I had walked right into. There was no work we could do to improve anything. We could only be there. I don't recognize any of this. Do you know where we're going? Sure. Yeah. It's, um... Great. I've gotta get to work. Shirt. Okay. Your eye is sharpening. I started to understand that the barn was not paint by numbers but that it was a whole geometry. We were using the minor angles of sundials and the unit grids of graphing to build a kind of monochrome mosaic. And it was also my monument to my detention to this place that made work feel worth doing. Have you been able to do your own work? Uh... trying to, a little bit. I'd like to see some of your pieces. After the inspection tomorrow. Tonight, I have to complete the paperwork. You finish up for the inspection. Are you kidding? Like my mother, I'm never kidding. Hey. Hey. I wanted to talk to you about, um... I'm leaving, tomorrow. Well... this is amazing. You have an incredible sense of... color and air. Where is Nils tonight? He's, um... drinking. Probably, uh, drinking and praying. Our inspection is tomorrow and he got so nervous that he decided to leave me in charge. Unthinkable. You think it'll pass? I don't know, what do you think? Yeah. It should pass. - Nils, I'm so sorry. - We're leaving. Since when does an artist like Nils Auermann give a crap about what anyone thinks? Today meant everything to him and I made a huge mess. No, I... I... I get it. You know what a huge mess is? I don't know, that you and Mom are splitting up so that you can now proceed to die alone? No. Your sister's wedding. Here, look at this. September 22nd at the Bowery Hotel. I RSVP'd no. I see Scott Glenny clearly. I've never seen anybody more clearly in my life. Yeah. We're done. Cool. Fuck it. My mother used to say, "Remember who you are and fuck it." What was your mother's name? Inga Görich. Sometimes I feel like I should just go home. Because I feel so much like a troll. I like trolls. They're so strong and they're never afraid, and they work in dark, cold places. Like me. Excuse me. Oh, hey. - I'm proud of you, honey. - I'm glad you came. In case you don't know me, I am Levi, I am Gaby's father. And... uh... my Gaby made a decision. Now, would I pick what she picked? Uh, no, I would not. No, sir, I would not. - Me neither! - Oh my God. You know, most of us, something picks us or we pick nothing, but, Gaby, you picked him and we said no and you said, "I pick him anyway" and you got him! Yeah. Nobody picked this except you. So whatever you have there is your fault. Your misery is your fault. Your happiness, well, that's up to you. It's up to you. You know, the... the only thing that ever made me... less scared of my misery... was my wife and she's over there. Well... forgive me. I lost track of things. Well, let's strike up the band, huh? - Can you bring those in? - I got the last... I got this one. And there's so much crap... Nils had disappeared into total silence but one day, an envelope arrived, full of foreign postage stamps. We passed. I thought I'd ruined everything. But maybe it was never really that fragile. You've gotten somewhere this summer. She's getting there. It's breathtaking. I know this woman and we've never met. Look at this light work. Her gaze, it's quiet and it's... radiant. Yeah, just stay on this path, this is so good. Yeah, it is. Did I run away from my life? Did I run toward it? Did I make the most of it? Did I fuck up? Did I... get where I needed to go? What kind of place was this? And are you going to be able to keep this up, now that you're back? Two, three.
