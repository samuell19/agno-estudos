Kate. Triple Americano. You pulling an all-nighter? Yeah. Finals coming up. Thank you. Hey, Kate. And to what do I owe this pleasure? I got a piece of your mail. Oh. Well remind me to thank my mailman later. Hey. You have any plans for dinner? No, I have homework. Shouldn't you be just about done with that? Yeah. Last semester. Oh. Well then come have dinner with me, Kate. Just as friends. Completely innocent. I swear. Hmm. Come on. Kate, you never go out. You got to eat, right? Okay. I do have to eat. And the company would be nice. Are you listening to music right now? I'm sorry. It's a habit. So, what sounds good to eat? You know, I saw there's a new café on 5th. Oh, yeah. Locomotive Café. Let's do it. Okay. That place was good. Yeah? You digged it? Thank you again. It was my pleasure, sweetheart. All right, well I'll see you later. Good night. Nick? Nick, if you're drunk, go home. I'm going to bed. Hey, sweetheart. That's twice in one day you're knocking on my door. Did you leave this on my doorstep? No. But if nobody takes the credit for it, I will. Kate, what's wrong? Most women like getting flowers. Not flowers with blood on it. What? There's blood on it, Nick. Did you do this? No, no. How do you know it's blood? Because it is. Okay. Look, come in, come in. We'll figure it out. Maybe it was an accident. You know, roses have thorns. Maybe your secret admirer was a little clumsy. Secret admirer? Well, yeah. I mean, who's gonna leave flowers on a woman's doorstep and not take the credit? I didn't think about that. It's just the blood freaked me out. Earlier today, I... I felt like I had eyes on me. Like I was being... watched. Oh my god. What? The... the rose. My... my book. What? When I was being watched, I was reading. I was reading The Purple Rose. Nick! The cover, it has the rose on it with the blood! Wait. Okay. Kate. Kate. Calm down. It could just be a coincidence. That is a hell of a coincidence, Nick. All right, Mags. Any other books need to be put away? That's it for now, dear. What's wrong, Kate? You seem down. Do I? I'm just tired. I've had a lot of homework lately. Is that all? I thought maybe you met someone. That man asking about you and that book seemed interested. Man? What, what man? The man in here yesterday. He said you recommended a book to him, but he couldn't remember the title. But he seemed more interested in you than the book. You don't know who I'm talking about? Uh, no. Sorry, I don't. What did he... What did he look like? I couldn't really tell. He was wearing a hat and he wouldn't look me in the eye. He seemed pretty average. Must have been a friend from school. He didn't seem like a student. But I think you could do better than that man anyway. Kate Riley? Detective Paine. So you think you're being stalked? Yeah. I think so. Why is that? Umm... someone's leaving me roses. But they have blood on them. Let's come on back? Okay. It's just up here. Where did it go? This is my place. It was sitting right here. I intentionally didn't touch it. Is there anyone else that might have grabbed it? Umm, maybe Nick. Nick? I'm so sorry. I... It was right there. And Nick will tell you about the other rose. Where is he? Nick?! I'm sorry, but there's not much I can do without the rose. Why don't you come back down to the station if Nick gets back and has the rose? I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not crazy. No need to apologize. I understand. Let me give you my card. You call me if you need anything. We're three blocks away. Thanks for coming. Hello, Kate. Aren't you gonna say hello? Who are you? What do you want? Don't be afraid, Kate. I'm not gonna hurt you. Then why are you hiding in the dark? Just come out and talk to me like a normal person. No, I'm not ready to do that yet, Kate. I just want to know if you liked my surprises I left for you. Umm... I'm not really big on surprises. Gosh, that's too bad, Kate. Because I have a lot more surprises for you. Kate! Honey, what am I gonna do with you? I just came to say hello, and then you ran from me. Gosh, that makes me angry. You don't want to make me angry. Oh, sweetheart. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What did I say, huh? I'm not gonna hurt you. No, but you can't blame me for enjoying what I have in front of me, Kate. I will enjoy you. Relax. Relax. There you go. See? Oh. I'm not so bad, sweetheart. I really can't wait for you to notice me. Kate, you will notice me. The man just left? Just like that? Yeah. Were you hoping that he would've done something else to me first? No, it's just odd. Well, look. I'm really tired, and I've given you every piece of information that I have. So can I please go home? Of course. We're finished here. I'll have another officer take you. Thank you. Dower! Please take Miss Riley home. Yes, sir. Do you want me to go have a look inside? Do you have anyone that can stay with you tonight? No. But my neighbor will be home soon. The station's only three blocks away. So if anything happens, we can be here in an instant. Thanks. That's comforting. Ma'am, I've given it a pretty thorough look. It looks all clear to me. Have a good night, ma'am. Please lock your doors and try to get some rest. Nick? Excuse me? Excuse me? Oh, I'm sorry. What can I get you? Ah, is Nick working? I have to talk to him. I haven't seen him. Do you know when he's working next? He was supposed to work last night and today. But he didn't show up for his shifts. So if you see him, tell him he owes me. I will. Hey, sweet thing. Where you going? I'm going home. So back off. Oh, come on. Let me buy you a drink. I said back off. I don't want a drink. Bitch, you think you're better than me? Oh my god. Thanks. How you holding up, dear? I'm fine, Mags. Are you sure you don't need anything? No. You've done enough rearranging your life to babysit me. Well I agree with the police. You shouldn't be alone. And I'm happy to be hear with you. Thanks, Mags. Speak of the devil. Or the angel. Hey, Kate. Got a second? Go use the back, dear. I'll cover the desk. I've done a little digging on your situation. Initially, you said you thought your neighbor Nick was behind the rose. Yeah, but it wasn't him. Have you seen him since you confronted him? No. You know, I'm actually getting kind-of worried. He hasn't returned any of my phone calls or anything. Do you think it's possible he's the one behind this? What? No. Kate, 85% of stalking cases, the victim knows their stalker. I... I don't care. It's not... It's not Nick. I know Nick. And the guy who attacked me said he wanted me to notice him. I've noticed Nick. We're friends. Just friends? Yes. Has he ever shown romantic interest in you? Asked you out on a date? Yeah, he's asked me out a couple times. Okay, did you reciprocate? Did you say yes? No. But... Okay. So Kate, it's possible that Nick feels rejected by you and he is going to extreme lengths to get you to notice him. No. It's not possible. He hasn't shown up at work. His friends haven't seen him. You said yourself that you haven't seen him since you confronted him about the rose. It's possible your reaction drove him into hiding. Or it's possible that the real stalker hurt Nick! Why? Why would he do that if the two of you aren't romantically involved? I don't know! He's crazy. Look, Nick isn't stalking me. I know Nick. Okay? And it's not like him to... to miss work or not return my phone calls. Something's happened to him. And you're wasting your time thinking that he's involved in this. Okay. Okay? Okay. If you feel that strongly about Nick, I won't bring him up again until I have more. Okay. And... and will you look for him? Yep. I will get my team on it. Thank you, Detective Paine. Please, call me Paine. Everybody else does cuz I am a complete pain in the ass. Thank you, Paine. You're welcome, Kate. Come on, sit down. Let's talk about how we're gonna keep you safe. So, you carry pepper spray? No. You do now. Always. And I want you alone as little as possible. You got family that you can stay with for a while? I grew up in the foster system. Once I turned 18, I never looked back. What about friends? Yeah, honestly Nick is kinda the closest thing I have to a friend. I kinda keep to myself too. Paine? Kate. You look tired. Yeah. Not the best night's sleep ever. You got a sec? Sure. Let's talk. What is it? Did you find Nick? Is he okay? No. No. We haven't found Nick. But we learned something. Do you recognize this guy? No. Wait, yeah, yeah. He was a sleezeball who was at the bar where Nick works. He wanted to buy me a drink. I said no. Why? Is he my stalker? No. No, he's not your stalker. But his body was found this morning behind the bar. His throat was slashed. I'm sorry. I don't understand. Kate, he had a note pinned to his jacket that said, "Kate, do you notice me yet?" And there was a purple rose lying next to him. Oh my god. This isn't happening I'm gonna be sick. Breathe, Kate. Breathe. Why is this happening? I don't know. But I need you to come back to the station with me. Okay. Let me introduce you to my team. Guys? These are detectives Marsh, Hansen, and Jones. Hi, ma'am. I'm Ben Jones. Jake Marsh. I'm the best looking one. Bill Hansen. All right, Kate. Tell me about this guy in the bar. He was no one. I went into the bar to see if Nick was working, and this drunk guy asked if he could buy me a drink. I said no, and then... Oh my god. What? The guy started to get handsy with me, and he wouldn't let go of me. So this other guy came in, and he punched him in the face. What guy? You said there was another guy. I don't know. It all happened so fast and he didn't say anything. Did you see his face at all? Could you tell if he was white or black? No, no. He was wearing a hat and sunglasses or something. He just nodded and then he went on his way. And then I left. I didn't think anything of it. Oh my god. That was him. He was there and he killed this man. This man is dead because of me. No, he's dead because somebody else killed him. This is not your fault, Kate. But obviously the stalker is much more dangerous than we initially thought. So I'm gonna assign my team to you. What does that mean? That means everything changes. Now. I'm gonna always have eyes on you. I'm gonna have one of these guys out front of your work, your apartment, your school, anywhere else you go. I know it seems like a lot, but you won't notice us too much. It's the only way we can keep you safe. You still think that Nick is a suspect? We can't rule him out. We can't find him or any known family. And we searched his apartment. Nothing's been disturbed. Forensics is looking at his phone now. Did you find the rose? No. It's possible that he ditched his apartment and he took the evidence with him. Wait. You said that his phone was there? Were his earbuds there too? I believe so. Yes, ma'am. Why? Nick never goes anywhere without his music. Nick is not my stalker! Nick is dead! Okay, that is the only thing that makes sense! If he's willing to murder this... this random guy, why wouldn't he hurt Nick too?! Kate, we will look into it. I promise. But right now, my focus is your safety. This is your security team. No one else. You see anybody else following you, or anybody who says they're filling in for one of us, I want you to get somewhere safe and call me. Snug as a bug, boss. Marsh is gonna relieve you at 8:00. Copy that. Huh, this is getting interesting. Jake, when did my professor say my paper was due? Is it the 15th or the 19th? Oh, I think it's due tomorrow. I'm just kidding. It's the 19th. Thanks. You're a big help. I know. So... you know what you're gonna write about yet? I don't know yet. Well, I think you should write about... Paine? No, not Paine. You should write about... Oh. Hi, boss. Sit, sit. Sit down. Sit down, Marsh. How are you? I'm okay. What are you doing here? Yeah, to what do we owe the pleasure? Can I get you a coffee? No. No. I'm okay. Okay, guys, what's going on? Kate. We don't have one significant lead. It's been two months since the incident, and we haven't heard from this guy. Okay. Paine, I understand. I mean I knew this couldn't go on forever. Uh, the department... Paine, you don't have to explain. Actually, I was gonna say something about it last week. But I've kinda grown to love you guys. You're like my family. I am so sorry, Kate. This is just... Don't be. Hey, it obviously worked. You know, we scared him off. For now. Sir this is ridiculous. Guys like this don't just... It's not my call, Marsh. The department is pulling us off. Then I would like to request a special assignment to stay with her. I can't do that. Then I'd like permission to protect her on my personal time. Look, Jake. That's ridiculous. Look, you all need to go back to your normal lives. And honestly, so do I. If I keep hiding out like this, he wins. It's time. Look, Kate... No. This is how it is. It's okay. Paine, when are you officially off my case? Five days. Okay. And of all of you, who's the best shot? Why? You want a gun? Yes. And I want all of you to teach me how to shoot it. And not miss. Deal. And maybe a few self defense lessons. Deal. Lock arms. Bend your knees. Focus. Go ahead. Not too bad, Kate. You're a quick learner. Well, I had good teachers. You guys, I'm gonna be okay. Hi. Can I help you find something? Umm, I loved this book. Do you have anything else she wrote? You know what, the sequel just came out. I haven't even put it on the shelves yet. Do you want to read it? Really? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Give me a minute. Okay, so... Where'd you go? You know, I haven't even read it yet. So let me know how you like it. I will. Thanks. Okay. Right over here. Hello again, Kate. I have waited so long to touch you again. Oh, I've really missed you. Did you miss me? I said, did you miss me? Yes. It makes me so glad to hear you say that. Do you want me to let you go? Yeah? Okay, okay. I will let you go. So, Kate? Did you like my surprise? What do you want? You, Kate. Isn't it obvious? All this is for you. Why? Because you are the one. You're not like the others. Where you going, Kate? Your gun is not over there. Stop running! There, there. No, it's okay. I'm so sorry I yelled at you. That's better. Good. Good. Turn around, please. Kate, turn around so I can see you. You are so beautiful. Look at me. Kate, look at me. All I want is for you to notice me. I would take such good care of you. Now, you're marked as mine. No other man will want you. Kate, listen. Are you listening? Your cop friends, I don't want them anywhere near you. And if you can't make them go away, I will. And I will, Kate. Remember what happened with your friend Nick. He was in the way of us, Kate. And if your cop friends get in the way, they will share the same fate. And I'll know, Kate. Because, honey, I know everything about you. It's... it's part of me taking care of you. Kate? Kate? Kate, can you hear me? No, go. Go. You have to go. Kate, Kate, we're not going anywhere. We're right here, okay? No, please. You have to go. All of you have to go. Kate, I am so sorry. It's not your fault. You're okay now, Kate. We are right here. We've got you. I know that this is difficult, Kate. But I need you to tell me what happened. The lights went out. I ran for the door, but he attacked me. He knew about you guys. He knew everything. He asked me if I liked his surprise. And then he told me that he killed Nick. Can you tell us anything us anything else? He cut my chest so that I'd be marked as his and no other man would want me. Son of a bitch. Kate, it's okay. It's okay. We got you now. You just relax. Let's give her a minute. All set, Jake. All right. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. So what do we got today? Oh, tuna salad sandwich. Yeah. That looks horrible. Yeah. So, it looks like you're finally getting released tomorrow, huh? Yeah. Yeah? Charge Nurse says you're getting discharged by noon. Thanks. Can you do me one more favor? Can you ask her for a snack? They have those muffins and apples at the nurse station. I'll grab you one. Thanks, Ben. Here you go. You scratched. I did not! Bullshit. That was a scratch. Scratch my ass! Scratch your own ass! Fellas. Is there a problem here? No, there's not. Well, you're disrupting the other guests. So could you please keep it down? Who you think you are? You little bitch! Back off! Hey! Apologize to the lady. For what?! We didn't do anything. You were disrespectful. All right, all right. Hey. They were just leaving. Get out. Let's go. Go on. Have a nice day. I had that under control. I know. I was just lending a hand. That guy just saved your ass. He's asked you out like a hundred times. Well then you go out with him. I would. But he didn't ask me. I... Thank you for your help. I didn't exactly have a plan. You're welcome. Oh, I didn't take your order. Umm, what do you want? Burger, medium rare. Fries. Okay. Detective Paine. Hi, Paine. Key, Kate. How's it going wherever you are? Pretty good. I got to kick some guy's ass in my bar tonight. Oh yeah? What is the name of that bar again? Funny. So, fill me in. Any updates? No. No. Okay. How are the guys? They're good. They're good. They're here actually. I'm gonna put you on speakerphone. Hi, Kate. Hi, Kate. Evening, Kate. Hey, guys. Wow, you guys are working late. Big case? When you coming home, Kate? You guys, this is how it is for now. I've gotten used to this new life. What life, Kate? You move constantly. You don't have any friends. Come home where we can protect you and be here for you. Okay, I got to go. I'll talk to you guys next week, okay? Bye, everyone. Bye, Kate. Bye, Kate. Maybe we should tell her. No, we can't take that risk. But isn't it time she knew what was going... No, it's not time for that, Ben. I underestimated you, Kate. But I will find you. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Well... Hi. Sorry. I wasn't paying attention. Oh, no. Don't be sorry. You just made my day. What are you doing? Umm, taking pictures of this old stuff. Are you a professional photographer? No. Hardly. I just enjoy it. Have you been out to the waterfall yet? I bet you'd get some great shots up there. Oh, I didn't know there was a waterfall around here. Yeah, yeah. About ten miles up the old highway. Sounds great. I don't have a car, so... I'd be happy to take you. Thank you. But I don't think that's a good idea. Why not? I don't know you. I come into your bar everyday. You probably know me better than most. I promise it won't disappoint. I own a ranch near there. I pass it all the time. It's stunning. Fine. But this isn't a date, Jack. I will be on my best behavior, Kate. Okay, let me just swing by my place and grab a different lens. Do you live far? I can drive you. I live right above the bar. Easy commute. This is my truck. I'll be waiting right here. Hey. You all set? Yep. All right, hop in. So, how far is the waterfall? Are you sick of me already? No. I just meant... I know what you meant. I'm just teasing. It's about fifteen minutes. Where is it? I don't see it. It's about a mile walk that way. Wait, what? There's a path. You'll be fine. No, I'm... I'm not walking a mile into the woods. What are you afraid of? Hey, I promised I would be on my best behavior. We drove out all this way. Don't you want to get your photos? Yeah. I'm just gonna make a call real quick, okay? Okay. I'll be back. Kate? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. You're calling. I know. I'm... I'm just going to take some pictures of a waterfall. Okay? Well, I'm not going alone. What do you mean? I mean, I know this guy and he's taking me. But we just have to walk a mile into the woods, and I thought you should know. You're going into the woods alone with a guy? Are you crazy, Kate? Okay, okay. It sounds worse than it is. I, I know him. He comes into my bar. What's his name? Jack. Jack what? I'm not telling you. You'll trace him to me. Kate, how am I supposed to keep you safe if you won't let me do my job? Come on. This is torture. All right, I'll call you every two hours until I get home. Two hours on the dot. I promise. On the dot, Kate. Bye. Hey! Everything okay? Yeah. Let's get going. All right. Whoa. You okay? Yeah. Sorry. Let's go. So who'd you have to call back there? No one. Just a friend. Is this the same friend that taught you how to fight? What? Back at the bar. You took down a guy twice your size and were ready to take on more. Oh. Yeah. What's your secret, Kate? My secret? You're very mysterious. Not mysterious. Just complicated. Well I'm sure I could keep up. Wow. You weren't kidding. I got some great shots. Glad to hear it. Yeah. You hungry? What's all this? I picked up a few things when you went to go grab your lens. Jack, I told you this wasn't a date. Candles don't make it a date. Never underestimate good lighting. You're a photographer. You should know that. Okay. So what's your story, Jack? My story? Nothing exciting. I run a ranch with my sister and her husband. I do most of the manual labor. They handle the books. It's a good system. How about you? What's your story? I don't have a story. Come on. What are your parents like? Umm, I don't know. I grew up in the foster system. So, what kind of animals do you have on your ranch? Usual stuff. Cows, chicken But I love the horses. Maybe you could come riding with me sometime. You could bring your camera. Help me take some pictures of the place. You don't have any pictures? Not yet. So what did you do before the ranch? I was a cop. I retired after my folks died. Decided I wanted to work the ranch with my sis. What? You don't like cops? No. I mean yeah. I just didn't... I didn't realize. The sun is hitting the waterfall perfect. Hand me my camera. I need a few shots of this. You know what? The sun is hitting you perfectly I want to get a shot of you. No, Jack! I like to take pictures, not be in them. But the lighting, Kate. You don't want to pass this up. Jack... Stop. Don't. Wait. Don't move. Wait. Perfect. You really didn't have to walk me to my door. I most certainly did. Well, thank you for today. I really did have a good time. Anytime, Kate. Hey, Jack? Goodnight. Hey, asshole. What are you doing? Are you following me? Yes. Why? Because I'm gonna kill you. Paine? I know. I know. We have to tell her. She's gonna be devastated. Yeah, the second she hears, she's gonna race back here. We need a plan. Sir, sir? What if we set a trap for this guy? Okay, if Kate does come back, at least we can control the situation and keep her safe. Hey! Hi. So what do you have planned today? You'll see. Hop in. Well, this is it. Rivers Ranch. Wow! Jack! This is beautiful! This is all yours? Mine and Avery's. And you have your own waterfall. You could've just brought me here. I didn't want to be presumptuous. Hey, Jack! Hey! So what are your plans for today? Gonna show Kate the grounds. Did you tell her to bring... Did you bring your camera? Uh, yeah. Yes. Then I thought maybe I'd teach her to milk a cow or drive a tractor. Well, I'm up for the cow, but no thanks on the tractor. It's not hard. It's like driving a really big truck. Well, I don't know how to drive a big truck or actually any car for that matter. So I would say that heavy machinery is out? You don't know how to drive? Nope. Since when? Since always. You know I don't own a car. I didn't think that was because you didn't know how to drive one Well then hop up because today you are learning. Well what happened to seeing the grounds? I want to see what you guys do here. Fine. I'll show you around. But then you are learning to drive. Come on. Have fun. This is a bad idea. Wish us luck. Good luck! I've been meaning to replace this fence anyway. I'm so sorry, Jack. It's okay. No, it's not okay. I panicked, and I'm sorry. It's okay. I promise. It's just a fence. I told you this was a bad idea. Hey, at least you didn't kill any of the chickens. That's a good thing. It's not funny. Hey. I think we should walk back. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm This place is amazing, Jack. It's everything I ever dreamed of. I used to have this fantasy of the perfect couple adopting me. And they would have a big beautiful house on acres of land, just like this one. And I would picture myself running out of the house with all the dogs. Go down to the stream. Skip some rocks. I like dogs. Sorry. I know it's stupid. It's not. It's nice. I wish you could've had that life. Well this is my workshop. It used to be my dad's. He built the whole place. Wow. Jack, this place is incredible. You are a lucky guy. I am now. But it's sunny out. It's Wyoming. Ready to run? Sure. It's so awesome. Damn it. Kate?! Hey, Kate?! You all right? Kate?! Kate, it's me. Kate, can you hear me? Kate, it's me, Jack. You're safe. Okay? Kate, put the gun down. Kate? Jack? I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're safe. I got you. I got you. Here. Drink this. Kate, tell me what happened to you. I miss the rain. It rained all the time in Portland. That's my home. It was. A man became obsessed with me. He stalked me for a while, leaving sick little hints. And then he attacked me. Paine is a detective. He and his team were assigned to protect me, and they did for a while. They were like my family. We thought we scared him off. Then one day I was closing up the store, and he came for me again. He told me that if I went back to the police he would kill them all, and I knew that he would because he'd already murdered two innocent people because of me. And then he... Then he marked me as his. He marked me so that no other man would want me. I had no idea what else he was capable of, so I had no choice. I had to run. I'm so sorry, Kate. How long have you been running? A little over a year. And I never stay in one place for long, which is why you and I can't... Hey, I'm not... I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. You're not running from me. Jack, I don't want you getting hurt. Enough people have been hurt because of me. No one's getting hurt. You're safe here. I wish that were true. Jack, he'll find me. No, he won't. Yes, he will. He has resources. I have to keep moving. I can't lay down roots. I can't leave a trail. I can't fall in love. I love you too, Kate. I'm sorry. No, don't be sorry. And don't be ashamed. I'm in love with you. Every part of you. Hey, boss. You tell Kate yet? No, not yet. Just sitting here stalling. Do you think it's strange that this guy never leaves one trace of evidence? And he's somehow always one step ahead of us? Yeah, I mean we profiled him to be intelligent. Yeah. What if it's more than that? What do you mean? Six murders. Six months. No clues. Who would know how to cover their tracks like that? A cop. Nice toga. You're not trying to skip out on me, are you? No. I was looking for my phone. It was buzzing. It's probably Paine. So does he call you every day? No, I call him once a week from a burner phone. Which is why I should find it. It's kind of weird he's calling me. Maybe it isn't him. No, Jack, nobody else has this number. So there are four of them. They're the only people who know where you are? They don't know where I am. I won't tell them. I told you, this asshole has resources. And I don't want them to be in danger. Thank you. Hello, Paine? Good morning, Kate. You got a second? Yeah, what's up? All the guys are here. I'm gonna put you on speakerphone. Hey, Kate. Hello, Kate. Hey, Kate. Hey, guys. Listen, Kate. There's something that I have to tell you. And I don't want to tell you over the phone. Please tell me where you are. Paine, no. We've been over this. Look, Kate. It's different this time, okay? You need to tell Paine. He needs to come get you. No. And it's not just me anymore, you guys. Paine? What the hell does that mean?! Who's there with you?! Kate?! Shh. Shh. Shut up. Shh. Shh. Kate, are you talking about Jack? Yes, I'm talking about Jack. That doesn't change anything, Kate. You need to tell me where you are. Paine, I said no. I'm not gonna risk it. What if he tracks you to me and and finds me? I'm tired of running, okay? The only way this is gonna work is if I stay away and I stay a secret. He's killing women, Kate! What? How do you know it's him? He's leaving notes. What do they say? Kate, tell me where you are. Paine, what do they say?! The first one said, "Do you notice me yet?" The first one? How many are there? Six. Been six in six months. All with a note addressed to you and a purple rose. Kate? What's wrong? Kate? Paine, right? What the hell is going on?! Jack, I'm guessing. Please put Kate back on the phone. Not until you tell me what's going on. That's up to Kate. But I need to talk to her. Well she doesn't want to talk. Jack, Jack, Jack... I'm fine. Give me the phone. I'm here. Listen, Kate. We know he's doing this to lure you out, but... Well it worked. I'm coming back. It's me he wants. And I can't let him just keep killing innocent women. I'm not letting you put yourself in danger. I have no choice. And I... I won't be in danger. Paine and the others will be there with me. Oh because they did such a great job protecting you last time. Call me selfish, but I don't care how many people he kills as long as he doesn't get to you. I can't just stay here in my happy little bubble. Okay, I have to do something. Then I'm going with you. Absolutely not. I don't think that's a good idea. I don't give a rats ass what you think. I will protect Kate. Kate, I was a cop too, remember? You don't have to worry about me. I can help. I don't know, Jack. I'm not letting you do this alone. Fine, but you have to work with Paine and the others. Nicely. Okay. Now that that's settled, Kate, can you put Jack back on the phone? Yeah. Hello? All right, let's cut the bullshit, Jack. What's your name? What's your story? Jack Rivers. I was a cop for ten years. What are you doing with Kate? With all due respect, I don't think this is the best time for the intentions speech. Or have you forgotten that there's a murderer after Kate? No, I have not. Which is why I'm asking you these questions. What was your badge number and what agency? 6991. Casper, Wyoming. Okay, Jack. We have reason to believe that Kate's stalker is also a cop. Which as you can imagine makes things much more difficult. I need to know that you can protect Kate. I want to catch this guy just as bad as you do. I want Kate to feel safe again. I will do anything to protect her. All right. Tell Kate we're gonna call her back when we have a plan. Okay. They're gonna call us back when they have a plan. I can't believe this is happening. Hey, this is not your fault, Kate. It is my fault. It was my choice to leave. You did what you had to do, what anyone would do. Hey, there's nothing wrong with that. All right. So Paine and Marsh are in a car out back. Don't look. Hansen and Jones are out front. They'll recognize anybody from Portland PD. I'm gonna walk you in. I'm gonna stay out of sight, and I'll be right back here. Okay? Okay. All right. What? Helps me relax. Yeah, well it's gonna be a long night. Yeah, no kidding. Hey. Hey. Everything looks good. I know everybody in here. I checked the bathrooms and the kitchen. Okay. Thank you. I'll call you when the last customer leaves. I'll be waiting right outside. Okay. I love you. I love you. Yeah. Okay. Okay, she's in. All clear inside. Copy that. Are you guys sure this is gonna work? He's been trying to get his hands on Kate for over a year. This guy doesn't have it in him to wait. And he knows he's got a two-day window before Kate heads back to Portland where she will be protected again. This is his best shot. He'll be here. It'll be tonight or tomorrow. Everybody settle in. Thank you. Thanks for coming in. Older couple is just leaving. Ten minutes 'till closing. Goodnight, Kate. I'll lock up the front. Goodnight, Gus. See you tomorrow. Cook is locking up. Okay guys, look alive. Here you go, sir. No rush. Hey, you look... you look kinda familiar. Yes. I escorted you home once. So you finally noticed me, Kate. You won't be needing that. I never forgot your smell. We would've been perfect together, Kate. But, but you ruined that. And now, your Jack's gonna have to pay just like your Nick did. I'll admit I was surprised when you left. Caused me a lot of trouble. But... Now it is your turn. Get up. What? What is funny? You. You skulk around in the shadows, terrorizing me, wanting me to notice you. Well here I am. I'm looking at you, and there's nothing to notice. You're just a pathetic little man. I'm gonna kill you. You think you're smarter than me? There. That's better. Why... Why are you doing this? After everything that I've done for you. You haven't done anything for me. How can you say that? All the women that I killed for you. You didn't do that for me. You did that for you. You are a sick demented son of a bitch. Oh Kate. I know that's what they told you. But all I wanted... All I wanted was to show you how far I would go for you to notice me. Okay. Okay. If you leave Jack alone, we can go away together. You think I want to be with you now? After you've been with him? No! I just wanted to tell you that you're special. Now you're not. You're just like the others. So I'm gonna kill you just like the others. Very slowly. Shit. You notice me now. Don't you, Kate? Jack, stop! He's not worth it! We got her. We got her. Dower? Oh, you're hurt. Oww. You okay? I am now. We got him, Kate. Have you guys officially met Jack? How you doing, Jack? What's up? Guess you're not such a pain in the ass. Maybe. Maybe not. Get him out of here. Come on. Come on. You really think this guy's gonna talk? I think it's worth a shot. He thinks he's smarter than we are. We're hoping his arrogance will get the best of him. Right now, all we got him on is aggravated assault. In some twisted way, he thinks he can still have her. She's the one that got away. I think she can get underneath his skin. Kate. Oh. Oh, sweetheart. Hi. I knew you couldn't stay away. I only came to see the look on your face knowing that we outsmarted you. You have nothing on me, Kate. But Frank, all those women that you told me that you murdered for me... Oh... That's funny. I don't remember saying that. You must've been confused. It's understandable considering all the duress you were under. Kate, you are very, very beautiful. But you are not smarter than me. The police said that the notes left on the women said, "Kate, do you notice me?" Uh, what does this have to do with me? You're right. I mean the man who left these notes was practically begging to be caught. And he's probably pretty stupid. I mean you're not. That killer, Kate, whoever he is, is brilliant. Do you have any idea what it takes to leave no piece of evidence? Oh, it can't be that hard. I mean this guy did it, and we just determined he's pretty stupid. I'm not! You don't know what you're talking about. It takes extraordinary skill. It takes a man who is so smart and very sensitive. Gosh, he killed those women right under the police department's nose. They were running around chasing a ghost. Oh, and have they ever found your friend, Nick? No? No?! You didn't? Takes intellect. Shh. Baby, don't cry, don't cry. You know, the police, they told me that this guy... Well he couldn't, you know, "do it" until after they were dead. You're lying. No. You're lying! No. You know, it's actually a running joke around the police station. Shut up. You didn't hear anything about that? Well I guess you don't really have any friends in here to talk to, so how would you know? Shut up! You know, I actually feel pretty sorry for this guy. The only way that he could get women is by killing them. And he's so pathetic that he can't have sex with them until they're dead. It's just sad. Shut up! I didn't... I didn't have sex with them, Kate! I could've, oh, while they were alive! I could've done anything! But I'm a good man. And I would not soil myself with them, Kate. I'll find you when I get out. And you know... You know I will get out, Kate. And I will come for you. Oh baby, I will have you. Alive or dead. Or maybe both. I'll be waiting for you. I will. But until then, you get to look at yourself in the mirror everyday and see that scar. You will see me, the only one you never got or ever will get. You're the one who's marked now, asshole. Sorry we're late. These guys couldn't make up their mind. No, yes we did. You just didn't want to listen. Right here. Right here. Come on in! Now the turkey's going in late and it's all your fault. How is this my... Look. It doesn't even fit, Paine. You got to admit this tree is much better, right? It's a good tree, Paine. It's too tall. It's perfect. Are you happy?
