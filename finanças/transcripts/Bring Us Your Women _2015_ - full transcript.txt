Your death was prevented and your lives extended as a program running within a cyborg. They fix glass eyeballs with cameras enclosed with wire lasing into the remains of your brain. Your glass eyes blinking fresh green light behind them, could identify the blunder and the grass bare path which leads to your garden full of hydrangeas and roses. That was your daughter, it is your daughter. You know her well. Two: the breakdown was inevitable the loss of technology the supposed end of humanity. People finally experienced grief and fear as the programs built inside cyborgs stopped running. Suddenclicks and breaks creating quick death or long drawn out pain. An overwhelming realization of existence, flailing and failing to grasp the fleeting, resulting in a gentle fading of what they used to call life. Escaping your fingers in grey pulling whisps. This is what you've missed and what in a quick few seconds breathe out and loose. - [Voiceover] She who weakened or uprooted or impoverished the meaning of her name is a lie, seductress, enchantress, distructress. These trusses did she cut. Revile her name, lament her sin original, call her dominatrix of shame. Reduce her to the weapons you see, tits and ass. Never understanding that she dances a pas de deux. Not victim and prey, but lovers two. Samson and Delilah No poor sucker and his femme fatale. He, seven braids and the burden of lonely strength. She, a compassionate ear, and the skills of razor and shears. Delilah, she knows that history allows the victors to write their story. Sage woman, she knows that the win of trickery is a loss. Delilah a person to carry strength for two. She knows that love is not combat, the way that all who love do. - [Voiceover] And then there is the body. You may remember the body, remembers, and what the body remembers remembers the body. There is your body. Your body is your body and one body is separate. And your body as one body is separate. Your body is a series of barriers and descriptors keeping you apart from other bodies and another body can see your body can touch your body, can touch another body, and a body can hold a body. Can press against a body and one body can fit around another body. And another body can fit inside another body. Your body can do this with another body until it forgets in brief choking splashes that it is or ever even has been a body. You may almost even imagine that there is no difference between your body and this other body if only for one or two seconds ever. If even you don't remember the body with remember. And a body can grow from a body, from your body a body can become another body. One other separate body that can remember a body. A body can remember another body after the other body stops being a body. That's a thing all bodies do is stop being bodies that are separate from other bodies. And other bodies become bodies and unbecome bodies. And there is a body that remembers all bodies, I think maybe somewhere in that stupid uncolored place you almost trip over at the tail end of your orgasm. There might be something there where is one other body other than your body or your lovers body, or your mothers body another body that holds a body that remembers. This body remembers the bodies your body can hold it all and remember your body remembers your body.
