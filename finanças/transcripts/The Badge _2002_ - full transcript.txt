I got some advice for you, honey-- go back to "Crawfish Bayou" or wherever the hell it is you're from. Work in a place like this, you're gonna develop some bad habits.

Driver said some woman ran in front of him. - Did you talk to her? - No. Couldn't find her. Can't find her? Let me know. What's up, buddy? Whose dog is this? His license and title were clean, but his insurance lapsed. Is that right? Are you hurt, son? - Are you all right? - Yes, sir, I'm all right. Boy, you dumped her in there, didn't you? Yes, sir. I sure did. I laid her on over. Now, listen. I don't know where you drive through, but in Louisiana you can't drive around with no insurance. I try to keep it up. I got to feed my kids, though. Yeah, I get you. That's an awful lot of shoes. I'm gonna have to give you a breathalyzer test. Oh, no, sir. Hell no. I ain't no drunk. You find that woman over there. It's her damn fault! Hey, CB, make the call, will you? - This is Rhonda. - Rhonda, CB. - We got some high tops. Want some? - Hells bells, save me a pair! Ponderosa. Appreciate it, CB. ...and what they're building, right down the road, is a gambling casino that will destroy our community. Truck wreck on 65. Darl's giving out free shoes. You cannot bring in Las Vegas-style gambling! This is a 7 1/2 medium. I bet you a million dollars that fits that girl. Gooch, what's up, buddy? You drunk yet? No, sir. This is the Lord's day. - Jack Daniel's got to wait. - Well, hurry sundown. They're some nasty tennis shoes. Just clean 'em up, they just been in the mud. That's a seven medium, it says. What's up, Cletus? You see, you got to say the magic words. - Okay? - Okay. - Who you gonna vote for? - Well, you, Sheriff. Darl: Hey, Ornell... you plannin' on pulling that damn thing out with that truck? Darl, before I get started, I got to get it straight. Who do I send the bill to? The judge executive pays the bills. - Hey, Darl? - Huh? - You ought to look at this. - What? There's a woman out here. She ain't moving. Man: Damn, she's good-lookin', huh? - Anybody know her? - Nope. It'd be nice if I did. Should we charge that trucker with manslaughter? I don't know. Maybe. There's a camera under my seat. Go get it and take some pictures. - Jesus. - Man: Amen. She's a believer. Good grief, little fella, you're about to get squashed. Now run. Run like the wind. - How you doin', sister? - Hey. Looks good, y'all. I didn't think the Lord gave out permits to work on Sundays. I aim to be open for business before the casino is. I'm trying to identify this gal right here. You ain't seen her before, have you? No. She don't go to my church. Well, I guess you wouldn't know her then, would you? Say, Henry. We ain't playing much football today, are we, Darl? Hell no. I Need you to help me out on something. You seen this little sweetheart? Hmm. She's a looker. - She got hit by a truck. - I heard that. No. I don't know her. Nah, your money's no good out here, Darl. My wife picked me out a pair of Hush Puppies. - They fit? - Oh, yeah. Good deal. All right, then. - Thanks for your help. - Okay, Darl. If you hear anything about this, let me know. - I sure will. Hey, Darl. - Yeah. Those kids out front-- Run 'em off. I'm getting complaints. All right. See you later, Henry. - Whew, that's good. - It's not good, it's dangerous. You little shits are going to have to get out of here. You're running off all of Henry's customers. What are you just standing for? Go on, get in the car. What the hell is wrong with you? - And you come with me. - Why? Because I said to. Come on. Come on, let's just go. Your mother don't let you smoke. Yeah, not in front of her. - Who is this? - I don't know. I'm trying to find out. So, how's school, hon'? - Amazing. - That's great. Can I get a tattoo? A tattoo of what? Gaia. - What's "Gaia"? - Gaia, the Earth goddess. When I was a kid in school, the only girls who had tattoos were girls that worked in tent shows, you know. I don't want you running around like carnival trash. Yeah, thanks. CB to Big Chief one, you copy? We're over at Doc's. You really got to see this. See what, CB? - Damn, squeegee. - Wait till you see this. - You ain't supposed to be in here. - You just wait. What the hell is going on? - She's got a pecker. - And titties. I see that, CB. Jesus Christ. She got a bigger dick than I do. Squeegee, I'll have to take your word on that. Oh, my Lord. I guess you'd call it a transvestite. Well, technically, because of the hormone-induced breasts, she'd be classified as a transsexual or transgender. A transvestite just likes to dress up. - An accident? - Nope. This is the culprit that killed her or him. A.22 caliber. Shot through the back and lodged in the chest cavity. Feet are cut up, so... so I feel like she ran a long way with this in her. Actual time of death... probably just about 45 minutes ago. Asphyxiation-- Lungs slowly filled up with blood. Damn, Darl, she was layin' there alive while we was unloading those damned shoes. Identifiable markings-- Jesus is a tattoo, but this here, that's-- that's a stamp. Like you'd get at a nightclub. Darl, this is clearly a homicide. Somebody should have called the state investigators before you moved the body. Excuse me, DA, I was called to investigate a traffic accident. - I didn't have any idea-- - Whoa! - That's cool. - What are you doing in here? Ashley's riding home with me. I'm parked out back. - Come on. - What? I wished to hell I had said no when she proposed to me. - It'd been a lot easier. - It's my fault you're miserable. That's what I said. You getting any alimony? I should be. I put her through law school. Doc, why don't you put something over this here? I don't want to lose my biscuits. The titties, they look so real. They are real, CB. What do you think they are? Well, they're not exactly real. They weren't real, they're real now, I guess. - They sure are pretty. - Hey, you cut that out. You sure know an awful lot about this kind of thing. No, I've read a lot. I'm well read, that's all. - I just read a lot. - Put on some heels and stockings. We don't want to know what's going on behind closed doors. Don't start that. Hey, Darl, I'm going back to the desk. You want me to call in the state forensic? Why? Carla said we should have done that from the beginning. I don't give a rat's ass what Carla said. I'm not calling in the state boys on a Sunday to get time and a half investigating a damn homo-cide. They'd be giving me shit from here on out. Have you seen my sunglasses? No. ♪ Where's my soul? ♪ ♪ Louisiana ♪ Good morning, Glena. Is the judge home? He's out back. Take the baby bear. This is the grandpa bear. See, he got a tie on. He got-- Looks like you got your hands full. My daughter thinks I'm a full-time babysitter. I've done nothing to dissuade her of that notion. You told me if I have a policy problem with Darl, I should let you know about it. That DOA. Darl doesn't want to call in the state investigation unit. Darl can be mule-headed. As a matter of policy, he should have checked with me before stealing those shoes. It's been years since Darl has handled a murder case, and the first 48 hours are crucial. Some crime investigations don't deserve the taxpayer's money. - This is one of them. - I beg your pardon? It's a matter of having the wrong kind of publicity in Le Salle parish at the wrong time. - You mean with the casino pending? - Mm-hmm. I know it's shoddy, but right now... Darl just might be the best man for the job. Pretty precious. I missed you. I was just gone for a minute and I missed you. Good grief. Darlene, this milk stinks. There's creamer in the cupboard. You know I don't like that powdered shit. This lady... she would like to speak to a sheriff or a deputy. Hi, my name is Darl. Pleased to meet you. - Are you the sheriff? - Yeah. Except, I don't use my gun unless the charm fails. You know what I mean? I'm worried about a friend of mine. You're not from around here, are you? Why do you say that? Because you look better than the people around here. Well, no, I drove up from New Orleans. How's everything down in New Orleans? It's fine. - You get down there much? - Well... if I got a good reason to, I go down there every now and then. Yeah, um... I'm worried about my girlfriend. She called me late Saturday night from Le Salle and I haven't heard from her since. Now, this might not have anything to do with it, I don't know, but did she happen to have a... A what? Golly, it's... a Jesus tattoo? Where are we going? Across the street. Oh God. - Full name? - Mona. - Mona what? - She just had one name. I felt something was wrong. - What happened? - She got shot. We found her out in the swamp. - Who did it? - I don't have a clue. Do you? No. Listen, this sex question on here, it's-- it's a little problematic. What box do you think I ought to check? However you like. All right. Both boxes. - Next of kin? - Me. Were you like her sister or something like that? I'm her wife. - Legal? - Legal. I'm sorry. I never really-- Hey. I'm sorry, but this is a little strange for me. I don't see this kind of thing every day. Ma'am, or... this is a murder case. I'm going to have to ask you some more questions. - Well, ask. - Okay. - What was she or he-- - She! All right. What was she doing in Le Salle? Mona called our house on Saturday night. She left a message on the answering machine around 3:00. - Mona: Hey, baby. - She said... Mona: I'm working at a Christmas party... ...she was working at a Christmas party in Le Salle and... Mona: I'm gonna have to catch a Greyhound. Don't worry, okay? I'll be home tomorrow. Her ride had left her stranded and in the morning she was going to catch a Greyhound. Sunday came. She didn't come home. Monday I started to worry. I called everybody. Nobody heard from her. Last night I drove up here. That's it. That's all I know. Where was this party at? I don't know. She's an entertainer. She performs at a lot of parties. What was she driving? She doesn't have a license. She doesn't have a car. Where did she call you from? I don't know. How about this Jesus tattoo she had on her? What's that all about? A few years ago, she went through this religious phase. She got this tattoo of Jesus over her heart. How about that stamp on her hand. That J-A? - What's that? - That's "Johnny Angel's." It's a nightclub in New Orleans where we work. Both of you work there? Yeah. Are you the same as she is, you know? I mean... What does that have to do with my husband being murdered? CB, what do you want? I'm sorry, Darl, but we got an emergency. There's a protest at the casino site and, well, your daddy's got a shotgun. Of course he has. Would you mind waiting in my office for a little bit? I got to take care of this. What are you doing? Now, look here. This was supposed to be a nice and peaceful protest. Nobody invited old Bull to show up here. - Do you hear me? - Yeah. Damn it! - He won't let me near him. - He's gonna kill somebody! Hey, it's me. Put the gun down! I've seen better sheriffs in Saturday morning cartoons. Oh, there he is. God himself-- "Mr. Own It, Mr. Buy It." Well, these raisins ain't for sale. Bull, you stupid drunk. Put that gun down. - Stay back. He's crazy. - All bark and no bite. Flatter than yesterday's beer. You are gone, partner. There's nothing left. I'm a dangerous man. I'm a killer. Bull, if you were gonna kill me, you would have killed me a long time ago. Gimme that gun. Get him out of my sight. Come on, Daddy. Come on, get up. Get up. Come on. Get off this hill. Come get in the car. Goddamn it. What are you doing up here shooting at things? I don't believe it'd do any good to lock him up, do you? Judge: Yeah. How you coming on that freak murder? We made an ID. She came out of New Orleans. That's what I figured. All the shit that floats ends up in New Orleans. Yeah. That's for sure. Darl... I don't want you to make too much noise with that particular case. I'd hate to have the newspapers stick the words "Le Salle Parish" and "Transsexual murder" - in the same headline. - I hear you. Here. See if you can talk some sense into that alcohol-soaked head of his. All right. That son of a bitch judge is a tadwhacker! That's what he is. He's bought up every piece of land this side of the lake except mine. I'll fry in hell before I sell out to that son of a bitch. No, sir, not for Fort Knox! Years back when the judge asked for my badge, I thought, how bad can that be to give it up? It's only a thin piece of tin. Well, what I didn't realize was that badge was my skin. It held me together. Don't ever let him do it to you, buddy boy. You don't have to worry about me. I don't. Your brother took a wrong turn. Took after your mama. But you are me. Big Chief to Station One. Darlene: Station One. Tell that Scarlet person to go back to New Orleans, - that I'm tied up, all right? - She's left already. She says she wasn't going back to New Orleans. She said she was going by the bus station to see if anybody had seen her husband. - Over. - All right. Woman: I use two sticks of butter. You know, margarine just don't taste right. 'Course it puts pounds on you. Oh, anything that tastes that good puts a few pounds on. Sheriff. What can I help you with? - How you doing? - All right. I was actually looking for somebody. Well, she was looking for somebody, too. Then we got to discussing shortbread recipes and-- I'm sorry I couldn't help you with your friend, honey. I'll keep an eye out for her, though. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Now, Sheriff, who were you looking for? I think I know where to find them. All right. I thought I told you to stay over there at the office. - Wait on me over there. I-- - I thought I could help. But it turns out that Mona never bought a bus ticket. Yeah, well... Okay. - That's you right there? - What's your sign? - Huh? - Your astrological sign. - Capricorn. - Oh. Stubborn. Selfish and stubborn. Anyhow, we'll handle everything from here on out. - Go back to New Orleans and-- - Look, you know what? I know that you think that Mona belongs in a petri dish. But you're wrong. Mona was the best person I've ever met. The kindest, gentlest person. Never put on airs. Was kind to everybody. You think that's easy, the choice that she made? It isn't. She's the bravest person I ever met. So, you put your prejudice aside and swear to me that you're gonna find out who did this. Okay, ma'am. We'll handle that right off the bat.

We'll have a big time-- You don't get to act like an ass all the time, expect to show up here and everything will be fine. You don't get off for free. You're in law enforcement, you should know that. You want to come over to see Ashley, fine. There's a party in Baton Rouge I'm going to. Is that right? I bet the Governor's going to be there, isn't he? Move your car. Hey, Judge. Let's just get right to the point. If you're taking some heat, I'll call the Governor right now and straighten it out. Darl, last week I visited an elementary school and I saw this little 10-year-old girl on a computer, talking to Kazakhstan. I'm not smart enough to know where Kazakhstan is, but I am smart enough to know that things are changing. What was good enough for Le Salle parish 10... 20 years ago-- I don't know what you're talking about. - Not a fucking clue! - There it is in a nutshell. The party's running Jackson for sheriff. - Is that right? - That's right. I'm running if I have to run against you and the party. It seems to me your father tried that once... to very little success. Don't talk about my father, okay? You and him both can kiss my ass. Excuse me, I just want to jump in front of you real quick. Hey, Lucy. I need that paper. That voter petition for elective office. All right. Thanks, honey. Rhonda: Sure, Darl, I'll sign. You're a good man. I'd tell that to anybody. Governor: Always good to see you, Darl. Judge: We told all sorts of lies to let them get elected dog catcher. What do you say, Gooch? I already signed for Jackson. I understand. I'm sorry, Darl. Henry: Just keep the trash out of my parking lot. You got it, Henry. I really appreciate it. Ornell! You're gonna go blind looking at that nooky. I'm looking for my... car catalogue. He's been looking for it for a half an hour. Ornell, listen, I need you to sign something for me if you would. What the hell is wrong with him? Hey, sister. You gonna sign this for me? Well, what are your views about the state supporting gambling? What's that got to do with anything? Well, we've got ourselves a Governor here who cavorts with harlots on the Sabbath, we've got ourselves a sheriff who steals shoes. Come to think of it, Jackson might be the better man. You know what I'm beginning to think? I'm beginning to think I liked you a lot better when you used to smoke all that reefer and we'd fuck in your Pinto. The Lord's arms are big enough to embrace all who have fallen down. I think you better get with it. So you're not gonna sign it? Carla: Darl, there were a lot of phone calls made about you last night. You should watch your back. Whoa! It's a red light. It usually means stop! Goddamn it! You little shits stay out of the road! You understand me? Darl, I prayed about it and I really don't think I can keep my shoes. And that Scarlet person called three times. Jackson is running against me. I guess you heard. Mm-hmm. Well? Yeah, I heard. CB, I gave him his job. And you know damn well he's gonna get all the black vote. I don't know what he's been telling you, but you can bet he's gonna go get him a deputy out of swamp town. CB? I need you on my side. I found your sunglasses. I found them in the back seat of my wife's car. Darlene: Hello? Sheriff's office. Darl... I've done everything you ever asked of me. Haven't I? Darl, it's that Scarlet person again. Pulled a fast one, did he? I told you he would. It was just a matter of time. He did it, you know? Who did what? Killed that freak. - You mean the judge? - Who else? And now he's running a swamp nigger to fill your slot. And what the fuck you gonna do about it? I didn't raise you to roll over, buddy boy. Why don't I just bitch and moan and bitch and moan and soak myself to death? Let the record show I never missed one day of work! Not one. No, sir! Go ahead, run, you son of a bitch! Come on, boy. Come on. Come on, boy. Come on, boy. Come here, buddy. All right. Feeding your little doggies? - How's it going, Cletus? - Good. What is it, about eight days until powder season? Yes, sir. It'll be about eight days. That's the dog that was at the wreck? Yes, sir. That's Buster there. Must have heard them brakes squealing and busted loose. Judge: Hey, Darl! You look lost. I just walked in from the highway. How y'all guys doing? Hey, Sheriff. What you got there? It's a shoe I found out there in the woods. I think it might have belonged to that freak. I thought you wasn't so interested in that case? Well, I'm getting more interested in it. Did you all have a party out here Saturday? Why are you asking? I don't know, I thought I might get invited to it. You're not a member. Man: Hey, Sheriff. When you catch who done it, you gonna lock 'em up or you going to give 'em a medal? I don't know. I haven't decided yet. Good seeing you, Darl. Don't get bit by no snakes walking in those woods. I'll try. Hey, Marcus? What are you doing in my car? Darl Hardwick. Move over to the car and place your hands on the roof. I don't know what you're talking about. For what? Taking shoes? Statutory rape. Statutory rape? What are you talking about? The girl you brought to the party was 15. I didn't touch her. - That's not what she said. - I don't give a shit what she says. Darl! Let me see your gun. Up with your hands up. Fine. Here's my hands up. - What are you going to do? - Hold a gun on him. - Fine. Excellent. - Listen, you piece of shit, - up against the car! - What are you looking at, Marcus? You're some kind of friend, aren't you? - I can get in the fucking car. - Get in there! Hey! Hey! It smells like shit in here! Oh, man! Here goes something. I'm recusing myself from the case. We're bringing in another prosecutor. Carla, I didn't do anything to that little girl. They must have paid her off to lie about me. - That's all I can think of. - I read her deposition. You're gonna need a really good lawyer. And I'm happy to make some recommendations. They're trying to push me out. That's all this is about. They know I'm onto something that could hurt them. I read her birth certificate. She was 15. I saw you leave with her. Everybody saw. She is Ashley's age. You just live in your own little playpen with your own goddamn rules, don't you? I can't even shop at Krogers without people looking at me Like I am pathetic. And I'm not pathetic, you're pathetic. I married a good man. But these last several years have been miserable. Where'd you go? Huh? It was a setup. The whole thing was a setup. I can prove it. Judge: You cop to the lesser charge, contributing to delinquency and we throw out the statutory rape. And you get out on 12 months probation. Darl, I'm trying to keep you out of jail. If I cop, it's a felony offense. I piss away my law enforcement career. Darl, I saw you serve that little girl drinks. That's against the law. Now, a condition of the probation is that you cannot leave the parish without permission. Howdy. - Need a ride? - A ride with who? The name's Gizmo. I play a mean Zydeco accordion, run an anti-gambling website on the Internet, and I'm a good friend and colleague of your friend and colleague, Sister Felicia. This here is Mark, my unpaid intern. That party at Tidewater, I heard a rumor the Governor was there. They say in Louisiana politics, the only way you can't get re-elected is if you get caught with a dead girl or a live boy.

Did you know that yesterday the state police moved your DOA to Baton Rouge? And the official records on the case have been sealed. I've been kind of out of the loop. I heard. You possess a special gift, Darl. I'm talking about the ability to bring the current political administration to its knees. I can help you get even. I don't need any help.

You're a little out of your jurisdiction, aren't you, Sheriff? Well... Nice place you got, though. This is Luna... my partner. This is Darl. My, my, the sheriff. Oh, we've heard about you. Well, I'm not a sheriff anymore, so there's a story right there. So any freak on the street could tell you where "Johnny Angel's" is, why'd you come in here, Darl? Well, it is Christmas, you know... so I thought I'd, you know, just come by and say-- Maybe say you're sorry? --see if you were alive. Y'all get a lot of diseases and everything. How considerate of you. It's good to know you haven't changed a bit. Canal and Belvedere Street. It's a green door on the back of a warehouse. - Merry Christmas, Darl. - Yeah, Merry Christmas. Hey gorgeous, look at you. Watch the nails. What's in the bag? - It's a shoe. - Let's see. Nice. Doc: That's a stamp. Like you'd get at a nightclub. Hello, cowboy. ♪ You're my little flower ♪ ♪ Flower, flower ♪ ♪ I remember when ♪ ♪ You were in my hands ♪ ♪ Time falls like a shower ♪ ♪ When I see you ♪ ♪ Flower ♪ ♪ There's a place where grace will take me to you ♪ ♪ I'll breathe ♪ Through you ♪ ♪ Flower ♪ ♪ Flower... ♪ - Nice job, sugar. - Thank you so much. - That was great, doll. - Thanks. - Hey. - Hey, Sheriff. I'm not a sheriff anymore. They catch you with your fingers in the cookie jar? No, actually, I'm pretty sure I'm being setup 'cause I'm investigating the murder of your husband. That's funny... 'cause I can't even get you to return my phone calls. - Hey! - Hey, watch it. Hey, faggot, what's your problem? Faggot. Say you made a mistake! Say you made a mistake! - Relax, buddy. - Hey! Hey, listen. I'm breaking my parole to talk to you. What do you want? A star on your forehead? - A round of applause? - Did this belong to Mona? - No. - You sure? I'm sure. Get the fuck out of the way. Stop! Stop! What?! I called you because I found out where the party was. Tidewater. Two years ago, a girl who worked in here was beaten to death with a tire iron. Right there on the side of this wall. And the cops told me to my face that she deserved it! If I help you... - will you go all the way? - Yeah. This is about real justice for Mona. So, that's her shoe back there? It's mine. We wore the same size. Darl, could you hold my lipstick? My pocket's got a hole in it. - Hey, Gator. - What's happenin', little mama? Good to see you tonight. Y'all gonna be here for a while? No, we're just gonna hop in and out. - Okay. - This is my friend Darl. - You think you can comp him? - Comp him?! - Please? - It'll cost you some sugar. It's okay. Tell him what you told me. I got friendly with a guy in Baton Rouge. I won't tell you who. It's not in my best interest. Once a month he pays us a healthy retainer to put on a lingerie show in Le Salle. The kind of deal where you ain't got to do nothing you don't want to. Some girls make dates to make extra cash. - But I'm not that greedy. - At the Tidewater? It's okay. He needs to know. I'll never say this in court. We finished up our show, counted up our tips and we're leaving, right? I know it's a quarter after 2:00 'cause I always check to see how long the ride back takes. We almost ran over her. She was walking away from the club. I really didn't even know it was Mona until... until you told me, sweetie, that was in Le Salle where she was found. And the Governor was there? We're well paid to say no to that question. I hate to see a pretty woman standing all alone. You didn't answer my question. - What question was that? - What's the deal with Darl? You know more about his situation than I do. That is a local matter. Somebody paid that girl. Well, if it wasn't that girl, it'd be the next girl or the drinking or the graft. Come on, Governor, you now that Darl wasn't doing anything that hasn't been done before. Are you telling me you want me to turn the clock back? 18.5% of my appointments have been to women and minorities. And nowadays, a smart, qualified woman like you has a place in Louisiana public service. But not Darl. So how could Mona model lingerie? Well, you saw her body. She had the body for it. No, I don't mean that. I mean... wouldn't there be kind of, like, a bump on the road there you might notice or something like that? Here's how you do it. You just tuck it in between your legs and put on a little G-string. All right. Golly. So, what's next, inspector? That phone number that Mona called you from, do you have that? - Did you lose it? - It's in a file at the office. Well, I know it by heart. I memorized it. Maybe you'll have better luck. Are all the girls that work here lesbians? Well, some of 'em. You see the worst side of men working here. - So you work here? - Yeah. The tips are good, the money's good. So, do you have to do... that tuck-in job yourself? Oooh, Darl, it's eating you up, isn't it? Hello? Is this Tidewater? Uh, no, I don't think so. This is Darl Hardwick, who am I speaking to? - Darl, it's me. - Me who? You got the phone booth out front of my place. Darl, I ain't never been paid for that shoe truck job. Yeah, well, I don't work for the county anymore, Ornell. I can't do anything about that. I ain't got no shoes either. Everybody got new shoes. I don't got new shoes. I'll talk to you later about that. I want to ask you something important first. You know that DOA we found out in the swamp? She made a phone call from your phone booth at 3:00 a.m. - Did you see her? - Sundays I don't open till 8:00. - I need to run a credit card. - Just a minute. Ornell, listen, I got to get going. Bye-bye. I ain't get no new shoes. You have to tell me something personal. You don't want to hear that. Trust me. Um... No, Darl, no. My Daddy's a crazy drunk. - Like father like son. - I'm not either. I drink like everybody else does. - What about your mama? - I never really knew her. She died when I was pretty young. My daddy didn't know how to take care of kids really, so me and my brother were pretty much raised by my grandparents. What's your brother like? He's... he's different. I think... I don't know, my mother's death kind of affected him different than it did me. I think probably more, really. How so? He turned out just... a little off somewhere, I don't know. He was a problematic kid, you know. I'll put it this way. When they asked me to run for sheriff, they said they'd back me, but only on one condition-- that I run my brother out of the parish. - So... - Who's they? The people that signed my checks. So, I ran him out of the parish. That's so sad. But that's not helping us connect the Governor to Mona, is it? I'm gonna get out of here and try to do something. Darl, you're not driving home like that. Look, I got a couch, okay? It's got Darl written all over it. ♪ Flower... ♪ ♪ Winter is almost here... ♪ If you drink water before you go to bed, the room won't spin. Thanks. Are you sure you don't want a pillow? No, I'm all right. Frankly, I'm just glad to have a couch. - Sweet dreams. - You, too. Goodnight. - I just-- - Darl-- I just... It's too soon. I can't. No, I know. I just... I was thinking about not being able to sleep or something like that, I just... Um-- Oooh. Wake up. Darl. I thought you'd gone. I forgot my keys. You left them inside. Why don't you go inside and warm up? I'll go fetch some coffee. Man: Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Oh! Is Mona here? I had an appointment at 9:00. Are you running over? - Running over what? - Oh. Well, I'll just-- I'm gonna come back later. Hey. Just so you know, some old shit came by. Said he had an appointment, whatever that means. Shoot, that was one of Mona's monthly's. I don't know what kind of operation y'all run, but it's disgusting. That's all I know. You seen my keys? His name is Mr. Pressman and he isn't a freak. He misses his wife, okay? They were married for 50 years and she died, so he misses her-- he likes to wear her dresses. Is that so fucking horrible? - That's perfectly normal. - Your keys are there on the mantel. - What are you so afraid of? - I think the whole situation - here is a little odd. - Oh, really? You run your own brother out of town, is that normal? Half the girls I know got fucked by their fathers, is that normal? You're a stripper that lives with a fucking freak that dresses old men up and shit. - You call that normal? - Don't talk about somebody-- You fucking wanted to fuck me and you didn't even know if I had a dick! Somebody like you killed Mona! Somebody who couldn't deal with their own fucked up sexual impulses. - Shut up! - You shut up! Fucking freak. Get out of my fucking way before I slap the shit out of you! Shut up! Mona, the DOA, was sent here as a lingerie model. I've got a witness that puts him at your gate at 2:15. And I've got a phone record that puts him in a phone booth at Ornell's, a mile that way. And... there's this little deal here. I found his bloody shoe in your back yard. - That's it? - No, it's not. There's a little matter of your dog. - Buster was found at the body. - Nothing that would stick. Stand up. - Is that fun? - Oh, yeah, you're a sweetie. He's clean. Darl, you know what an imbroglio is? No, I don't. That was one of my favorite words in college. It means a complicated situation. We had a party. The kind you don't bring your wife to. That freak could have passed for Miss America. Maybe she was here... and maybe she wasn't. Whatever. Bottom line, we did not kill her. Him. Cletus can tell you. This place was locked up tight and everybody cleared out by 2:30. When that truck driver saw that woman on the highway, we was home with our wives. Burnson's people are on my ass to go public. If the press gets a whiff of that, our Governor partying with a transsexual lingerie model that ends up dead later on... he's going to drop like a rock. And your casino project will drop, too. Burnson probably set the whole thing up himself. The members of this club are honorable men, Darl. You want those kind of enemies? I always wondered what it was like in here, now I know it smells like shit in here. Y'all threw a spitball at my head with that waitress thing-- I'm getting this overturned. I'm getting my job back. You think you know what you're doing, but you don't. Really? Is that right? If I'm not notified by noon tomorrow that the appeals board is reconsidering my case, I'm going to the press. I'll call Burnson quicker than shit. Sleep good. What the hell do we do now? Something they didn't teach you in the Kennedy Business School. Darl, wait up there! Hold on, son! We thought about it. And we generally accept your demands. We work in good faith to get your job back. But there's a loose end. What about that Scarlet person? Does she know what you know? She gave a false address on the death certificate. Do you know how we can contact her? She's in New Orleans. We know that. I'll get you an address. I'll give you a call. The sooner the better. What's wrong with you? When you lost your badge, that was it, you lost everything. You got that right. So, whatever it takes, I mean, to get it back and everything, that's what I got to do. Is that about it? I never missed a day of work. I had a perfect record. Even after you cleaned her off the floor? What? Who? That wasn't my fault. David always said you shot her. Oooh, that faggot's every bit as crazy as she was. Myself, I never believed you had the guts. Hey, she pulled my own gun. My chrome-handled Smith & Wesson with the six-inch barrel, and was waving it at me. Screaming all sorts of her hysterical shit. She was crazy. She puts it right there to the side of her head and that's when I say to her, the last words I said, "Go ahead, bitch, do it!" I made it in to work the next day. I pulled a full shift. I had a perfect record. Man: Here you go, sugar. Darl: Howdy, ma'am. Well, hello, cowboy. I'm looking for Scarlet. Well, she ain't here. You think she's over at that strip joint? Maybe. You know, she told me that you're the one trying to find that bastard who killed Mona. You having any luck? Yeah, we're making a little progress. Girls like me got a free-shot bull seye on our backs. If you solve this one, it'd be a first. And, honey, you are so fine that I might give you that Purple Heart myself. I appreciate that. You have a good day. Yeah, we're here now. I'll call you later. All right. Judge's bodyguard: She gave a false address on the death certificate. Judge: Do you know how we can contact her? - What's happening, man? - Is Scarlet around? Yeah, she's here. That's $10. Scarlet's up there doing it for you fellas. Working hard for your tips and appreciation. Show your appreciation by stepping up there and tipping that sexy lady. Hi, baby.

No. It's a two-drink minimum. ♪ Before now ♪ ♪ You got sole custody ♪ ♪ Sole custody of me ♪ ♪ Sole custody ♪ ♪ Sole custody of me ♪ ♪ Sole custody ♪ ♪ Sole custody of me ♪ ♪ Sole custody ♪ ♪ Sole custody ♪ ♪ All of me. ♪ Everybody in the house put those hands together. Make some noise out there for the beautiful Ms. Scarlet. We got to get out of here. What? I'm not going anywhere with you! The Governor's people are on to you. - How do they know about me?! - Don't worry about that. What the fuck are you doing back here?! - I'm talking-- - I don't give a fuck! I said I'm talking to her, motherfucker! Gator, I know him! Hey, it's me. It's okay! - I know him. - I don't care if he's your dad! We got rules! Hey, look! You can leave here on a stretcher or you can leave here like a gentleman. - Okay. Okay! - All right then. Let go of me. - Hey, stop it! - Motherfucker. - Goddamn it! - I told your motherfucking ass.

Everybody needs help. Do me a favor, see if you can read that. - Gizmo Herbert, Republican Party-- - Shit! - What? - They've ID'd the truck. Woman: Hey! - Where's David? - What happened to you? - I need to borrow his car. - David! I'll tell you later. David! I know you knew Mona. The guys that killed her are after us. I need to borrow your car. I really need you to help me out here. Please. - Do you have the keys? - Yes. - What's it look like? - It's out front. It's a Volvo. Listen, if anybody comes around asking-- - I don't know anything. - Take these here. You might need to disguise. Listen, Darl. You know, getting kicked out of Le Salle was the best thing that ever happened to me. I wonder what makes people turn out the way they turn out? I don't know. Mona said she always liked her Barbies from the git-go. Okay, so we tell them that you want to talk to the press. Now, don't be afraid to tell them everything you know about Mona and Tidewater. The whole shooting match, okay? When your story gets out, that's your protection, Okay? You all right? I can't believe I'm depending on the Republicans to save me. Where's Gizmo? Hey, Darl. I believe Darl misread our intentions. We weren't going to hurt you. We were just going to stake you to a paid vacation in Cancun till after the election. Your little elves put a bullet through my truck. - That was a mistake. - A mistake? - Darl, what's going on? - Hell if I know. A truce. More like a Mexican standoff. Sister Felicia confessed. The anti-casino folks hashed a plan to pick up a transsexual from a New Orleans club-- Sister Felicia was in on this? Partially. Her job was to tip Gizmo when the Governor showed up at Tidewater. Gizmo picked Mona up from "Johnny Angel's," he invited her to work a Christmas party. Drove her into the sticks with the premeditated purpose of snapping a few photos of a transgender person socializing with the Governor. - You killed Mona? - Nope. I'll pass a polygraph. But you drove her to Tidewater? Okay. But when her telephoto lens came out, the freak freaks got all offended that we had an M.O. Thought it was a play for money, whatever, she was hysterical. It got iffy, so we kicked her out of the car - and George Jetson-- - You just left her? Yeah, Bubba, we just left her. Then who killed Mona? I can tell you with complete certainty that nobody in this room committed a capital crime. Both parties committed failures of judgment only. Now we should negotiate a binding and good-faith settlement to keep this story in this room. Let's let the campaign decide the issues. That's what the people want. Well, if you can't tell me who killed Mona, you have nothing for me. There it is. A fly in the ketchup. Somebody like Mona or Scarlet here might have a conscience. This place stinks worse than Tidewater. Let's get out of here. Darl, you're the last person to be lecturing anybody on ethics. You're right, Judge. You're always right. Judge: Darl! Darl, hold up. You're a parole violator who's fired on police. - Don't be stupid. - That's what I do best. Don't worry, I'm not going to the press. I don't give a shit who wins or loses this stupid election. But I guarantee you one thing, I'm gonna find out who killed her husband. And anybody who tries to stop me, I will go down kicking and screaming. Are you just going to let him leave? I'm out of my jurisdiction. You're out of your job. Hey, Darl! There's a woman out here. Scarlet: This is about real justice for Mona. This is Darl Hardwick. Who am I speaking to? Ornell: Darl, it's me. You got the phone booth out front of my place. Darl: She made a phone call from your phone booth out there at 3:00 a.m. - Did you see her? - No, I didn't. So, Ornell said he was asleep. Didn't see anything. Something about this place really feels weird. Is that it? 65, 40, $1.05 Louisiana sales tax, $1.16. Boy, you got it down, don't you, Ornell? I still ain't been paid for that shoe truck. You have to take that up with the judge, bud. Do you have a ladies room I could use? Ladies room is closed. It's unclean. Well, do you have a men's bathroom? I don't believe in that, no ma'am. There's a Dixie Burger up the road. She don't want to go to Dixie Burger. She wants to use the bathroom, don't be silly. You're not one of them? One of who? Them one's who use a bathroom they ain't supposed to use. - Where's the key, Ornell? - I lost it. Hey! Hey! Who's gonna pay for this?! What is it, Darl? Who do I bill for that? Ornell: You can't go in there. That's employees only! Scarlet: Darl... Oh my God. You sat there and watched that girl through that peek hole, didn't you? If this gun matches that bullet that killed her, it's all over. Why? I want you to tell me. I'm gonna fuck you. Tell me you want me. Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck you. Bitch. Bitch. Bitch! Get out, you freak! Freak! - Oh my God! - You tricked me. You bitch! You tricked me, you whore! You're bad. Bad! Stay away from me, you son of a bitch. Please. Help me! Please! You ain't telling nobody on me! I'll kill you! - I'll kill you! - God! Bitch! He never should have went in the ladies. That's not right. That's for ladies. That's all I'm going to say about it. Oh my God. I got it! - Hello? - Hi. How are things? Fine. That's good. Do you want Mom? Yeah. And tell her it's important, all right? She might be needed here. - Hold on. - Hey, hey, wait. What? I just want to tell you I love you. I love you both. Hold on, I'll get Mom. Mom! Reporter: Turning to election news. Louisiana voters say no politics in view. I think the transsexual scandal had a huge impact on souring voters, for both Brower and Burnson. In a Baton Rouge press conference, Governor Brower stated that yesterday's loss is not the end of his political career. Governor: And although I am conceding this race, I am not defeated, not when there's work left to do for the people of Louisiana. Woman: Well, well, well. Look how beautiful we are. And I know Mona's smiling down on us today. I know that all of us have lost people. And every time I think about her being faced down in that swamp, it breaks my heart. But we're not gonna talk about that today. Because she was beautiful and she'd like to be remembered beautiful. And she'd be so happy that all of you are here. - Thank you so much. - Crowd: Amen. Scarlet: Hey. I was hoping you'd come. I'm just... giving away some of Mona's stuff. I didn't wanna go through it all by myself. I have a little confession to make. I knew who you were before I first walked into your office that first day. David told me that you were brothers, and he told me you were a real dick. And we both thought it best that I'd not tell you we knew each other 'cause you might hold it against us. I probably would have. I'm sorry for lying about it. Well, I think I'm gonna go over here and thank somebody for a car. It's about time. Are you gonna be here? Yeah, I'll be right here.
