Don't worry. ﻿You ready? I go fast. ﻿Is it tied tight? ﻿Yeah, see ﻿Okay? ﻿How was it? ﻿Fun, but a bit too chill. ﻿I thought Shiran was afraid of heights. ﻿Yeah, but Itai's there. ﻿I guess she's over it. ﻿I think everyone gets on the ladder ^just because of him. ﻿And I think Ariel la is into someone else. ﻿What? ﻿Ariella to Ofek 3 Satellite, over. ﻿No way. ﻿You sure? -Yeah. ﻿I think he's into you. -No... ﻿Don't do that. -Come on, go for it. ﻿Go for it! ﻿Hey, I saw you looking at me. ﻿You're very direct, but you're wrong. ﻿But I saw you. ﻿Must've been an optical illusion. ﻿Okay. ﻿If you change your mind, I'm on that side of the party. ﻿An optical illusion? ﻿Stop it. ﻿I think this is the illusion you need. -No... ﻿Just a little. -Yeah. ﻿This one, too. ﻿Here she is. ﻿What a rush. ﻿So, no more fear of heights? ﻿Hallelujah. ﻿It's 11:30, tell me your mom's on the way. ﻿Ariella, let's go back with one of the guys. ﻿Please, I really wanna stay. ﻿Yeah, stay. ﻿Itai will take you home later. ﻿I really have to go. ﻿We'll leave in an hour. ﻿Didn't you want to drive? ﻿I can't. ﻿I'll let you drive a bit on the way back. ﻿I really have to go, okay? ﻿Just a few more minutes. ﻿Don't be such a downer. ﻿Enough! I have to go! ﻿Leave her alone. ﻿Shit. ﻿Hi, this is Ariella, try to leave a message in... ﻿Its late. She should be available. ﻿Where to? ﻿I'm going to get her ﻿Giora, calm down, it's not midnight yet. ﻿She will be back and everything will be alright. ﻿She won't be late. I promise you. ﻿If she is not here by midnight I'm going to get her! ﻿Hi, this is Ariel la, try to leave a message in less than five words ﻿Do you think you could try and call one of her friends? ﻿Giora.. ﻿Hey. -Hi, Nuchka. ﻿Are you all right? Why are you late? ﻿I tried to get home as fast as I could. ﻿Ariella, come here, please. ﻿- You were not available.. - My phone was dead. ﻿Ariella! ﻿I said, come here. ﻿Yes father. ﻿Aside from the fact that you are late, ﻿Is there something you want to tell me? ﻿No, why? -How did you get home? ﻿Shiran's mom. ﻿I'll ask you one more time, ﻿are you sure? ﻿Yes. ﻿No, no. ﻿I suggest you don't talk back ﻿because you might make things worse. ﻿Is there something you're not telling me? ﻿No, nothing. ﻿Giora. ﻿Last time. ﻿Are you sure? ﻿Yes. ﻿Okay. ﻿Take your pants off, please. ﻿Giora, what are you doing? ﻿Nava, let me handle this. Take them off. ﻿Why would you tell me to do that? -Off. ﻿Giora. -Nava, stop, please. ﻿Take them off. ﻿Okay. ﻿Put them back on. ﻿Go to the power box and bring me what you find there. ﻿Ariella. ﻿Reut, sweetie, everything is OK. Go back to bed. ﻿Go to sleep. ﻿You didn't get it? ﻿Didn't get what, Giora? There's nothing there. ﻿Okay, get her bag and spill out the contents. ﻿It's okay, Mom. ﻿There are no secrets in there. ﻿Sadly, I have to punish you. ﻿For what you did ﻿and for trying to hide it from us. ﻿Giora, wait, you're taking this too far. ﻿Stop it, this is hard enough as it is. ﻿Where are the red scissors? -What are you going to do? ﻿I want to find out why she's spinning a web of lies ﻿and you expect me to applaud her for it? ﻿Did you know your daughter hitches rides in the middle of the night? ﻿When men ﻿see you ﻿half naked in the middle of the night, ﻿I don't have to tell you what goes through their minds. ﻿You could've been raped, God forbid! ﻿All that would've been left was to regret ﻿your irresponsible behavior. ﻿You see this letter? ﻿This envelope contains ﻿the pain of people ﻿whose lives were ruined because of one mistake. ﻿Actions have consequences. ﻿Now you are going to stay here until 6am ﻿so people can see what you look like ﻿and compliment you on your promiscuity. ﻿If you don't pay for your mistakes, ﻿you'll never learn to avoid them. ﻿Thank you, Dad. ﻿Thank you for punishing me in order to teach me. ﻿Go to sleep, Nava. ﻿I'll watch over her. ﻿How can I sleep when she's out there like that? ﻿She's got no limits and we have to nip it in the bud. ﻿I'd like to know where your limits are. ﻿Lately it seems you're losing them. ﻿I'm sure she's strong enough to learn a lesson from this. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Maybe I'm not strong enough to stay here and watch this. ﻿Look at that retard. ﻿Good morning. ﻿Good morning, Ariella. ﻿I don't think it's that good. ﻿When's the last time we synchronized watches? ﻿It's not 6:00 on yours either. ﻿Stop it, Dad. Really. ﻿Really what? ﻿I was very clear when I said 6am. -One minute to go. ﻿It's one minute to six, Dad, I want to go to sleep. ﻿You can get a lot done in one minute. ﻿A lot. ﻿You need to learn the value of time. ﻿And accuracy. ﻿It's when you want something else that accuracy becomes so important. ﻿Come. ﻿I want to see you make the bed in one minute. ﻿Go. ﻿Go, go, go, go. ﻿Ariella, I'm starting. ﻿One minute. ﻿40 seconds. ﻿20 seconds. ﻿One minute. -It's impossible. ﻿It's not impossible. ﻿It's okay. ﻿Try again. ﻿Until you get it right. ﻿Come on. ﻿One minute. ﻿It's okay, lluz will wait, we have all the time in the world. ﻿What happened? Show me your hand. -It's nothing. ﻿We need disinfectant and a Band-Aid. ﻿I'll ask Mom. ﻿All right. ﻿Go to your mother. ﻿Be careful. ﻿It's because you're tired, princess. ﻿Go to sleep, okay? ﻿When you get up well go to the springs with Reut. ﻿The prettiest girl in school ﻿Has the prettiest eyes in school ﻿The prettiest braid, the prettiest mouth ﻿And the more you look at her... ﻿Nuchka, sing with us. ﻿Don't call me Nuchka, you know I hate it. ﻿All right. ﻿It's just that "Ariella" is long sometimes. ﻿You could've named me Noa. ﻿Noa doesn't suit you. ﻿I wanted Maya. ﻿Why are you going the long way? ﻿For once the gate is open... ﻿I prefer going around. ﻿It's much shorter that way. ﻿But this way is easier. ﻿You know Dad says this area is off limits. ﻿So for once explain to me why. ﻿Because he said so. -And if he said there were giraffes in there? ﻿Just goes to show you only do things his way. ﻿You know very well I don't do everything his way. ﻿All my friends drove their parents' car before the driving test. ﻿I can't even ask him to do that. ﻿As if you didn't drive enough in your instructor's car. ﻿It's not the same thing. ﻿I want to drive to build up my confidence. ﻿I'll fail the test because of you. ﻿How will you drive? In flip flops? ﻿Then I'll put on your shoes, Mom. ﻿What if we run into a cop? Our licenses will be suspended. ﻿A cop, in the middle of fucking nowhere? ﻿Ariella, if something happens, how will I face your father? ﻿You see? -See what? ﻿I see that I see nothing because of those rocks. ﻿Can you get out and guide me? ﻿Yeah, this road is easier... ﻿I don't believe I'm saying this, but I'll let you drive on the way back. ﻿Not another word, okay? Everyone sing with me. ﻿The prettiest girl in school ﻿Has the prettiest eyes... ﻿You already finished a bottle? ﻿Sure, she drinks more than what she puts on my head. ﻿No I don't. Ow, It got in my eye! It burns! ﻿Show me. ﻿Just go rinse it out. ﻿Don't put your hair in the water, it won't work. ﻿Aw, you little brat! ﻿Ew. ﻿Ew. ﻿You had it corning. ﻿Kuti, give me your shirt so you can go in the water. ﻿She doesn't want us to see her in a bathing suit. ﻿Really, Kuti? -Come on, don't be shy. ﻿You're embarrassed in front of your mom and sister? ﻿Shut up now. I love this song. ﻿You're Russian, no way you can do this. ﻿As if you're from Marrakesh... ﻿Mom, call it quits. ﻿Why? I think I'm doing pretty good. ﻿Aren't I, Ariella? ﻿Your daughter turned out to be a bimbo. ﻿Because your mom is a bimbo. ﻿Nuchka... ﻿Careful, turn the wheel a little. ﻿Like this. -Okay. -Good. ﻿Careful. ﻿Who wants some more strawberries? ﻿Mom, you're not watching the road. ﻿It's okay, I am. ﻿Okay, let's switch. ﻿You can get out and guide me. Mom! Mom! ﻿Mom, Mom! ﻿Mom, get up! Mom! ﻿Mom, Mom. ﻿Mom, get up. ﻿Come on. ﻿Come here. ﻿Get out. ﻿Faster. ﻿Come. ﻿Help me pick her up. ﻿Come on. ﻿I can't. -Yes you can! ﻿Call an ambulance. ﻿-It'll be too late by the time they come. ﻿Come on...now, come on. ﻿Come on, 1,2, 3... ﻿Open the door! ﻿Wider! ﻿Help me with her legs. ﻿Okay. ﻿Please, Mom, wake up. ﻿Mom. ﻿You can't park here, move the car. ﻿Kuti, stay here, I'll be right back. ﻿Turn her over. Open the door. ﻿Open the glove compartment, please. ﻿Open it. -I can't. ﻿Go to the end of the parking lot ﻿Give me the form. ﻿Give this to her. ﻿Give her something to drink. ﻿Give this to your sister. ﻿Hello, can I have a minute? ﻿Is she yours? -Uh huh. ﻿They got here about two hours ago... ﻿Ariella, I'm Gideon, I'm a doctor. ﻿I just spoke to the medical staff that's treating your mom. ﻿Ariella, I'm sure you know your mom is in a coma. ﻿Many people have come out of a coma. ﻿Especially during the first days. ﻿Okay. ﻿Go see your mother. ﻿Go on, Ariella. ﻿It was scary. -I know, sweetheart. It'll be fine, you'll see. ﻿Come, Ariella. ﻿Take off your shoes and come to eat. ﻿The food's hot. ﻿There's goulash that your mom made. ﻿I don't want to eat. ﻿You have to. -Why? -Because you have to. ﻿Grandma. -What? ﻿Mom never forces anyone to eat something they don't want. ﻿I hate to say this, ﻿but that pains me a lot. ﻿That I couldn't teach my daughter in law ﻿that children need some boundaries. ﻿Reut, tell your sister that I'll let it go this time, ﻿but if she keeps up that behavior I won't be able to let it go next time. ﻿Ariella, Grandma says... -It's okay, Kuti, I heard her. ﻿When I'm here, young lady, I expect you to have some boundaries. ﻿Why aren't you going to bed? ﻿Want me to brush your hair? ﻿Is this okay? ﻿You're gonna get punished, aren't you? ﻿But you don't have to worry. ﻿Why not? ﻿Because I deserve it. ﻿Reut. ﻿It's all knots anyway. ﻿You were so brave today. ﻿I'm going in. ﻿What are you going to tell his parents? ﻿The truth. ﻿What truth? ﻿That I'm responsible for what happened. ﻿That I'm sorry. ﻿You don't have to say a thing. ﻿They say they know you didn't mean it. ﻿That he would've wanted them to forgive you. ﻿Really? ﻿No, they say that even here you got late. ﻿That you're a coward, that you won't make it to the front door. ﻿They're wrong. ﻿Even Nava will tell them that they're wrong. ﻿She can't talk. ﻿You're on your own. I ﻿dare you. ﻿Maybe I didn't park on this level. ﻿There aren't many levels, well find it in the end. ﻿Maybe I missed the spot. ﻿If we did, well start over. ﻿Just pick up the pace, please. ﻿I can't. I'm tired. ﻿We're all tired, Ariella, let's go. ﻿I'm hungry. ﻿I haven't eaten since yesterday morning. ﻿Grandma was acting crazy yesterday. -Ariella, I'm warning you. ﻿At least try to remember near what color you parked. ﻿I just think we shouldn't leave Reut alone with her. ﻿Ariella! ﻿Finally. Get in the car, I'll take you back to the ground level. ﻿My bag is in the trunk. I know you convinced your mother to let you drive. ﻿And I know you feel guilty for what you did. ﻿And rightfully so. ﻿I also know you're waiting to be punished for what you did. ﻿But the punishment won't come from me. ﻿I can't think of any punishment that will help. ﻿I'll find the punishment this time. ﻿This isn't the time for nonsense. ﻿I'm going home to get clothes. ﻿Go to your mother's room and wait there until I'm back. ﻿Hey girl, Where to? ﻿"Where to?" Forget that. ﻿We're going to have a barbecue, you wanna come? ﻿But sit in the middle. ﻿My legs are too long. ﻿Not just your legs. ﻿What's your name? -"What's your name?" You moron. Maya. ﻿Explain the game to her. ﻿Okay, listen up, Maya, these are the rules. ﻿One of us chooses a word, the others have to sing a song with that word. ﻿Whoever hesitates, gets it. ﻿Stop. ﻿Sky. ﻿My little girl and a piece of sky... ﻿Under an empty sky... ﻿I can't bear to see ﻿The reflection in the sky ﻿Of your blue eyes... ﻿They're brown, aren't they? Noam? ﻿You gotta punch him. ﻿Now. ﻿So you get the game? ﻿But since we don't hit girls, ﻿if you lose, you'll have to take your shirt off. ﻿Elad. ﻿Chill, dude. ﻿I was joking. I didn't offend you, did I? ﻿Stop. ﻿K. Key. ﻿Key. ﻿A latchkey kid in space ﻿A TV game... -I know the key word... ﻿If you want ﻿To open the magic door ﻿I will give you a key ﻿Take it and be happy... -Be a guest. ﻿Be a guest. ﻿Guest, right, sorry. "Dad" ﻿Well? -He sang the song already. ﻿You don't do that, moron. ﻿It doesn't count. -You got the word wrong! ﻿What about her? ﻿I can't think of a song. ﻿You don't have to, he was just... ﻿You have beautiful breasts. ﻿I get why you're so proud of them. ﻿Can I touch them? ﻿So soft. ﻿Touch it Noam. ﻿Touch. ﻿Can I? ﻿Touch. ﻿Oh, shit. ﻿Ew, fuck, dude. Stop the car. ﻿Pull over! ﻿Fuck, what's wrong with you? Can't you control yourself? ﻿Get outta the car. ﻿You could've said you're about to puke. ﻿Fuck! Get back in. -Wait. -Get in. Let's go. -What about her? ﻿I don't care. Go. ﻿Yuvi, step on it. ﻿Hello? -Reut ﻿Ariella, where are you?- ﻿I'm here, where are you? ﻿At the hospital. Where did you go? ﻿How's Mom? ﻿The same. Where did you go? ﻿Don't worry, sweetie. I'll be back soon. ﻿When Mom wakes up. ﻿What should I tell Dad? ﻿Kuti, listen to me, ﻿no matter what, don't tell Dad we talked. ﻿It's our secret. ﻿You know he'll find you. ﻿I'll go somewhere where he won't look for me. ﻿Ariella, where are you ﻿I gotta go. Kiss on the nose. ﻿Come back to me. ﻿Kid, your bag. ﻿"Private Property!" ﻿Ow! ﻿Shit. ﻿Are you all right? ﻿What do you want? ﻿Stay away. ﻿I just want to get you out. -Don't bother. ﻿I want to stay here with this thing on my foot. ﻿Why did you enter this area? ﻿Because there was a sign saying not to. May I? ﻿Why won't you tell me your name? Maya. Maya. ﻿I'm Ben. ﻿I hope you're not in too much pain. ﻿Pain is a relative thing. ﻿That's one gorgeous fox you caught. ﻿Looks like you caught a girlfriend. -Yeah, right. ﻿Who the hell is he? ﻿Siton, I'm just getting her out. -Gimme that. ﻿I'll do it. ﻿Couldn't you put a sign, "Caution, trap?" ﻿Foxes can't read. ﻿Ben, I'll walk to the greenhouse. ﻿Want me to leave you two alone? ﻿Cool it, okay? ﻿What did I say? ﻿No, I'm coming with you. ﻿Stop! ﻿My shoe is torn! ﻿Stop! ﻿Do you always throw stones at people who try to help you? ﻿Only when they catch me in a trap. ﻿I'll go get some glue from the house. ﻿Fields spilt in the distance from horizon to doorstep ﻿And carobs, olives and Mount Gilboa ﻿To its evening the valley succumbs ﻿In beauty never seen before ﻿This is not the same valley ﻿You're not married, are you? ﻿Why do you ask? ﻿Why, I don't look like a married man? ﻿People are always quick to judge. ﻿So you're married? ﻿No. Why do you ask? ﻿Never mind. ﻿five.. ﻿In the bitter dust the asphodel blooms ﻿And on the grass there is a boy with his dog ﻿The room is lit and nights fall ﻿I need a place to stay for a few days. ﻿I'm sorry, you'll have to find someplace else. ﻿We work here, it's not a hotel. ﻿Then I'll work. ﻿It's farming, it's hard work. ﻿Are you saying that because I'm a girl? ﻿No. ﻿I don't know many men who have the endurance to work here. ﻿I'm sure I can endure more than you. ﻿five.. ﻿If you can take the heat longer than me, ﻿I'm outta here. ﻿If not, I start working here. ﻿One... ﻿two... ﻿three... ﻿four... ﻿five.. ﻿six... ﻿seven... -Why are you doing this? ﻿What's wrong with you? ﻿Did I get the job? ﻿It's okay. ﻿Never mind. ﻿It's an old grandpa's remedy. ﻿You mean an old grandma's remedy. ﻿Tell that to my grandfather. ﻿Let it soak in. ﻿Take the shears. ﻿Cut it close to the edge. ﻿No, no, no, here. ﻿The edge. Exactly. ﻿Good. Now put it here. ﻿Put the pin as close to the middle as possible. ﻿A bit more, exactly. ﻿Gently. ﻿Good. ﻿Now you put it in the bouquet, ﻿as close to one another as possible. ﻿Closer. ﻿Right here. ﻿Like this. ﻿Good. ﻿Engineering, special forces, paratroopers. ﻿You do a lot for the army, huh? ﻿Yes.’ ﻿What'll you do if we ever have peace? ﻿Don't worry. ﻿We have people who succumbed to disease, natural death, car accidents. Maya? ﻿It's stifling in here, I need some air. ﻿Yeah, sure, take a break. ﻿I'm going to get something for my grandfather, I'll be back soon. ﻿Wait, take this. ﻿I will be back soon. ﻿Five, six, seven.. ﻿seven. ﻿One, two, three, four. ﻿I have to go back to work. ﻿I have to go back to the greenhouse, I have a lot of work to do. ﻿Ben trusts me. ﻿Siton, ﻿I need your help. ﻿Why not ask Ben? ﻿Ben is very special. ﻿You must have noticed that. ﻿He can help you with anything. ﻿Ben can't help me with this. ﻿Have you ever felt ﻿that something hurts so bad inside ﻿that if you don't do something, your heart will explode? ﻿My body hurts all over. ﻿I can't even talk. ﻿How can I help you? ﻿What are you doing? ﻿What are you doing? No. ﻿I'm no idiot, I know this is wrong. ﻿Get dressed. No, no. -Why? ﻿Put your shirt back on. ﻿Put your shirt back on. This is wrong. ﻿Put your shirt back on. ﻿Look at me. ﻿Aren't you cold? ﻿Flowers must be kept at a low temperature, ﻿so they don't wilt so fast. ﻿Get dressed, okay? ﻿Touch me. ﻿You don't want this. -Touch me. ﻿I want you to. ﻿Really? ﻿Please, I need you to touch me. ﻿Where? ﻿Here? ﻿Is this okay? ﻿Wherever you want. ﻿Like this? ﻿Are you teasing me? ﻿Why? ﻿You're teasing me? ﻿Why are you doing this? ﻿Why did you do that? ﻿You want to hurt me? ﻿Is that what you want? ﻿Huh? ﻿Why did you do that? ﻿Take your things. ﻿Take them. ﻿Why did you do that? ﻿Why, just to tease me? ﻿Stay here, okay? I'm leaving. ﻿Wait a few minutes then leave. ﻿You hear me? ﻿Don't follow me out! ﻿Stay here! ﻿You're mean. Why did you do it? ﻿Can you help me please? ﻿You can move her arm up and down in the meantime. ﻿It helps prevent stiffness of the joints. ﻿You can go outside. I'll get you when I'm done. ﻿Hey, this is Ariella. ﻿Say whatever you want in less than 5 words. ﻿Is Ariella here? -No. ﻿Where is she? ﻿Probably at a friend's. ﻿Why do you think so? Did you talk to her? ﻿I tried, she won't answer. ﻿Aren't you worried? ﻿She'll be back when she realizes she's making a mistake. ﻿Reut, did you talk to your sister? ﻿I suggest you finish eating and I'll stay with her for a while. ﻿I'm sure you have important things to do. ﻿I don't know. ﻿I don't know. Maya? ﻿Maya, are you in there? ﻿Maya, stop playing around. ﻿It's dangerous. ﻿It's 2 degrees in there, you could get hypothermia. ﻿Answer me. ﻿Leave me alone. Maya, ﻿let me in so I can see you're okay. I promise, I won't make you come out. ﻿Enough. ﻿I can tell you're going through something tough. ﻿But it won't help to sit here and suffer. ﻿Come out now! You have to warm up. ﻿You want to help? ﻿Then leave me alone. ﻿That's enough. Come. ﻿I want to stay here. ﻿Then I'll stay and freeze with you. ﻿Siton, get the delivery ready. ﻿We're nearly there. ﻿ e have to be quiet. ﻿Did I sleep? ﻿For a few hours. ﻿Are you thirsty? ﻿You want to tell me what happened? ﻿Why do you have an M16 on the wall? ﻿My grandpa... ﻿got it from the army after my dad was killed. ﻿It doesn't shoot, the inner parts were removed and they casted iron inside. ﻿I understand if you don't want to talk about it. ﻿I don't mind talking about it. ﻿Sometimes it helps. ﻿Was this his, too? ﻿Yes. ﻿Does it work? ﻿Sure it works. ﻿If you found this tape, ﻿then at least 100 years must have gone by. ﻿I'll describe the pretty girl sitting next to me ﻿so you know what pretty girls looked like 100 years ago. ﻿Well, ﻿her eyes ﻿are right next to one another. ﻿And her nose is above her mouth. ﻿Sounds weird? ﻿Believe me, it's true. ﻿If you found this tape, ﻿then at least 100 years must have gone by. ﻿What band is this? ﻿Trondheim? ﻿It's a city ﻿in Norway. ﻿It's a broadcast of a game that our national basketball team played there. ﻿My dad was the captain. ﻿I listen to it a lot. ﻿It's the only recording I have of his voice. ﻿I want to hear it. ﻿The game was fast paced, we did everything we could. ﻿I think we played real well. ﻿But they played better. That's not what counts. ﻿What counts is that we represented our country with honor. ﻿I think the guys in Jerusalem can be proud of us ﻿for coming here and giving our all for our country. ﻿while we're playing, ﻿there are people in Israel who are keeping everyone safe. ﻿And it's very exciting to represent them. ﻿I hope we win next time... ﻿Thank you, Ariel Kleinman from the cadet team. Back to you. ﻿Your voices sound the same. ﻿Yes. ﻿And I'm told we look alike, too. ﻿You do look alike. ﻿Siton was with him when he was killed. ﻿My grandpa says he's messed up because of it. ﻿His commander was promoted. ﻿Otherwise they'd have to admit that my dad died because of his arrogance. ﻿Did you meet him? ﻿His commander? ﻿No. ﻿And I don't think I ever will. ﻿He's not even sorry. ﻿How do you know? ﻿20 years and he hasn't come here to ask my grandpa for forgiveness. ﻿And he never answered the letters we sent him. ﻿Are you all right? ﻿Yes, I... ﻿I'm still very tired. ﻿Yeah... ﻿I'm tired, too. ﻿Good night. ﻿Good night. ﻿I'm going in. ﻿What are you going to tell his parents? ﻿The truth. ﻿How will the truth help them? ﻿Had you arrived one minute earlier when it happened, we wouldn't have to be here now. ﻿Maybe. ﻿You didn't know a commander has to be on time? ﻿Ariella? ﻿When's the last time we synchronized watches? ﻿What? ﻿Hey, it's Arietta. Say whatever you want in less than 5 words. ﻿Ariella, you're still not answering. ﻿I hope you understand the situation we're in. ﻿And I suggest ﻿you get a grip ﻿and get to the hospital or to Grandma's house ﻿by midnight. ﻿Is that clear? ﻿Hey, it's Ariel la. Say whatever you want in less than 5 words. ﻿Ariella, it's Dad. ﻿I'm terribly worried. ﻿'m begging you, ﻿if you hear this message, ﻿call me. ﻿"Fatal delay - Parents of Ariel Kleinman blame unit commander for his death" ﻿"Special unit operation gone wrong. One solider dead." ﻿Want something to eat? ﻿I'm not hungry. ﻿Want some chocolate? ﻿No, I don't want anything. ﻿Reut? ﻿What? ﻿Who are you texting? ﻿What? Nobody. ﻿Reut, when's the last time you spoke to your sister? ﻿Actually, I do want some chocolate. ﻿All right. ﻿Just a second.. ﻿I'm asking you again. ﻿When did you speak to Ariel la? ﻿Before she disappeared. ﻿And she hasn't called you since? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Reut, tell me! When's the last time you spoke to Ariella? ﻿Dad, I did something wrong. ﻿I lied. I deserve to be punished. ﻿I'm sure you meant no harm. ﻿Did she say where she is? ﻿She didn't tell me. I told her to come back. ﻿She said she won't come back until Mom wakes up. ﻿What? ﻿She said she won't come back until Mom wakes up. ﻿Get your things, let's go. ﻿Hello there. ﻿Where to? ﻿Inside the farm? -Whatever. ﻿Oh yeah? ﻿One of those days, I guess. ﻿Giora, I have the coordinates. ﻿Go ahead, Yair. ﻿Reut, put the numbers in that Yair says. ﻿Hi, Reut, do you hear me? -Yes. ﻿50-43-31 ﻿34-59-34 ﻿Did you get that? -Yes. ﻿Great. ﻿Thanks, Yair, we're on our way. ﻿Daddy, what are those numbers? ﻿The address Ariella is at. ﻿All set ﻿In 800 meters, turn left. ﻿What the hell is she doing here? ﻿You have reached your destination. ﻿"Arik Ranch - Private Property!" ﻿Hey, it's Ariella. Say whatever you want in less... ﻿Where is she, Daddy? Why aren't we going in? The gate's open. ﻿You're so pretty. ﻿Like a seashell. ﻿Shall we get in the back? ﻿Sure. ﻿Sure. ﻿"Dad" ﻿Ariella! ﻿Ariella! ﻿Can you hear me, Ariel la? ﻿Ariella! ﻿Someone like you should be treated like a princess. ﻿Ariella! ﻿Ariella, do you hear me? Hold on tight. ﻿Ariella, can you hear me? ﻿Drink a little more. You're beautiful. ﻿Ariella! I'm here. ﻿Drink up. ﻿Voila. ﻿I'll take care of everything. ﻿Wait, wait. -What's wrong? ﻿I've never done this. ﻿Even better. ﻿At first it'll hurt, then it'll feel good. ﻿Everything is going to be alright. ﻿You're beautiful. ﻿You're so beautiful. ﻿You're beautiful, like a seashell. ﻿You're beautiful. ﻿Why did we stop? ﻿Ariella. ﻿Please. ﻿Where are you? ﻿Ariella! ﻿Ariella! ﻿I'm here, Ariella! ﻿Ariella! ﻿I'm here, Ariella! Ariella! ﻿Ariella! ﻿Ariella, we're here. ﻿Where are you, Ariella? ﻿Ariella? -What's that? ﻿Fuck. ﻿Ariella, are you OK? ﻿Are you OK? -Why? Why? ﻿Why? Why did she fall? -It's okay, it's over, it's over. ﻿I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it. -I know, I know. ﻿I ran her over. ﻿Ariella, I'm so sorry. ﻿I hope someday you'll be able to forgive me. ﻿Let me help you. ﻿Let me try and help you. ﻿You don't understand. ﻿It's my fault. ﻿It's all my fault and I'll have to live with it for the rest of my life. ﻿But I'll help you. ﻿What would you rather do? ﻿Run away from it? ﻿Search for punishment all your life? ﻿You want to be like me? Is that what you want? ﻿Ariella, I'm so sorry.
