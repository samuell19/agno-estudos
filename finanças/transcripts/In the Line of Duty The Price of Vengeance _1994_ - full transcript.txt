(suspenseful music) (distant siren wails) - Gimme the money, now. (engine cranks) (gunshot cracks) I said now! (gunshots crack) - Come on, man! Let's go! (tires squeal) (engine roars) (tires screech) - Hey, George. Listen to this. That creep Alonzo gets paroled today. That means that I spent more time nailing him than he spent in the can. - Yeah, what else is know? Hey, you coming to Rev's after the shift? - Oh, yeah, sure, but I gotta humiliate Jerry on the racquetball court first, get some of my poker money back. - Hey, Jack, George. - Morning. - You guys know anything about soccer? I'm trying to find out the difference between a direct and an indirect free kick. - Ha! Don't ask me. Ask me about golf if you want to. Oh, I know. Try Lopez in Narcotics. He should know about that. - I'm in trouble. My son Ryan's soccer coach has got appendicitis and I said I'd take his place. - Morning, Jean. - So, Jack, I hear you and Liz are back together. - Yeah, she moved back in Friday. And, uh, the fires are burning hot again. (Jean hisses) - Hey, Jim, you know anything about soccer? - Zip. Okay, we got an armed robbery assault at a theater and an armed robbery at Belinda's Modeling Agency. I'll flip you for the models, Tom. - You're on. - Okay. Call it. - Heads. - Tails. All right. (Jim whistling merrily) (bright, whimsical music) - Well, this is the guy the theater manager ID'd. Is this limousine thing a legit business? - Oh, yeah, he's licensed. Does the Oscars, the Emmys. Must do pretty well. - Didn't even change the plates. Unit 24 requests backup for arrest at 12601 Alador Avenue. - [Dispatcher] 24, roger your request, 12601 Alador. Stand by. - So tell me about this guy you're dating. - Well, he's really nice. You know, solid. Divorced. - [Tom] There's Moore. (suspenseful music) - [Johnnie] The drop kick! (men laughing) - Okay, cover me now. - I do the blocks, man. I got it all. - [Johnnie] Let's roll, guys. - Johnnie Moore! (shotgun racks) - What do you want? - I'm Detective Williams. Is that your car? - It's one of 'em. - Please step over here. - What for? - You're under arrest for armed robbery and attempted murder. Step over here, please. - Attempted murder? That's crazy. Look, I don't know nothing about this. I rent these cars out. It's my business. I got records. You wanna see the records? I got dates and times. Look. I'll help you find this guy, okay? - That's great. We can talk about it after you're booked. - [Cop] No talking, keep moving. - I've instructed my client not to talk to you unless I'm present. And I'm informing you that Mr. Moore is a legitimate businessman and will not tolerate harassment of any kind by the Los Angeles Police Department. - $16,000 bail for attempted murder. - Are you surprised? - I planned that thing for weeks. Shoulda gone down no problem. No witness, no case. That was the plan. You really screwed me up on this, Ramirez. Shoulda stayed there, finished the job. Stuck to the plan. - See, your cheekbones look higher. Changes the whole shape of your face. (upbeat R&B music) ♪ Feel the love ♪ - Try the mustache. ♪ The love of your family ♪ Mm, check it out. (laughs) All right! (laughs) What do you think, sugar? Huh? How do you love me best? - Hmm. ♪ Love each passing hour ♪ ♪ Learn to find a way ♪ - See you later. All right! Down to business. I wanna do that little jeweler number first, all right? Monday, Wednesday, Friday. At noon, he takes the samples, drives down Lindley, takes a left on Saticoy, straight into the Palm Plaza. Now, the plan is that we hit him here, right? Escape route down through here. We meet up here. There'll be a fresh car waiting. (doorbell buzzes) Who's that? - That's my man Lawrence. Our new driver. - He's late. - He's a good man. He's got some talent. I sent him to steal us a taxi. - Bring him in. Where'd you get the car? - At the company lot. Hotwired it. - Anyone see you? - No. No, it was off the shift. No one would notice for 12 hours. - They'll trace the plate. - Plate's off another taxi in for an engine job. Never miss it. - Good. Good thinking. Come here. Come on. We're not some lowlife band of outlaws. We've got class. We've got principles. We've got God on our side. We do his work: redistribution of the wealth of this earth. You understand? (ominous music) Life teaches us that when we do things, we must do them right. Only three rules. No drugs. I don't tolerate nothing. Two: no screw-ups. Three: complete loyalty. We are family. Any questions? - No, Mr. Moore. - You should've seen him, Norma. Three big forwards coming in on him, defense nowhere to be seen. They hammer one to the far side of the goal. Ryan makes this diving leap and gets a piece of it. What a great save. - That's is good, Ryan. Susan, come on, now! - Okay, I'm coming! - But I let six go in the goal. - Now who cares about that? It was a beauty of a save. Louis is still in bad shape. I might wind up coaching all season. - Really? Listen, can you take Suzy to school? I've gotta get to the office early. - Sure, what's up? - Oh, we're hiring junior loan officers. I've gotta see about 30 MBAs before lunch. - Not a problem. - Gimme the jelly, you little mutt. - Susan, you ready to go? 'Cause I am running... What have you got on your face? - All my friends have worn makeup for years except me. - Susan, I want your faced washed before you leave this house. - I don't have time! - There's time for that. (upbeat pop music) Suzy. First, it's that I don't think you need makeup. You're so pretty, honey. And second, I've seen what happens to some girls who try to grow up too fast. - I'm 17, Dad. Do you know that if we lived in India, I'd be considered, like, an old maid now? - All right, all right. Just a little makeup. - Thanks, Daddy. You're the best. Oh, you can drop me right here at the corner. Mom always does. I'll walk. - Right here? Why? - Well, it's good exercise and, you know... - You feel like a nerd with your parents driving you to school. - Yeah, sorta. Bye, Daddy. Uh-oh. - Hmm? Oh. (laughs) - [Suzy] Matt! - [Joe] The man pointed a gun at me and told me to give him the money. Then he fired a shot and I gave him the money. Then he fired two more times at me but missed. He was gonna fire more, but he had trouble with the gun. Then he jumped in the car and drove off. - I'm going to ask you in this preliminary hearing the same question I'll ask you in the trial. Is this gunman in the courtroom? - Yes. He's that man. Johnnie Moore. - It'll be a pretty straightforward ID trial. We should put him away on your testimony, but we'll see what the defense comes up with. - God punishes those who lie. - God punishes people who shoot at people and steal their money. - Keep moving, Johnnie. Get outta here. (suspenseful music) - [Ricky] Go. (tires screech) (glass clinking) - What happened? - Man, what's wrong with you? All slamming on your breaks without giving no warning? - (laughs) It was a red light! - You're a menace on the road, man! (gunshots crack) (crowd screams) - [Woman] They shot him! - [Man] Get down, get down! - [Ricky] Yeah! - Come on, man! Let's go! No witnesses! Anyone talks to the cops, they end up like the man over there! No witnesses! Nobody saw nothing! Nothing! Let's go. (tires screech) (siren whoops) - The taxi was stolen yesterday from the compound near 18th and Figueroa. Plates stolen. They dust for prints? - They just left. We found two 9 millimeter casings corresponding to the wounds in the body, but we haven't been able to find any witnesses. - What, broad daylight? Two shots fired and no witnesses? - They're all real spooked, Tom. - Just a minute. Hi. You, uh... You see the accident? - No. - You see the shooting? Hear the shots? - No. - How many men were there? - Look, nobody saw nothing, all right? That's what they told us, or else I'll wind up like that guy. Nobody's looking for trouble, man. - How about I subpoena you as a hostile witness? - Wanna waste your time? Feel free. (siren wailing) - [Jean] Told you. - Good, Ryan. That's much better. Heads up! Hey, good, good! (Tom claps) Now remember, this time bend your knees. On your toes, hands up. Hey! All right, that's okay. Good try, good try. Listen, I gotta go cook some burgers. - You know, for a guy that's never played soccer, you showed me some dazzling footwork there. - Hey, Dad, how come you're not wearing the frilly apron? - Oh, I don't know. You know, I like that frilly apron, but those ruffles, they tickle, Jack. (Suzy laughs) - You know, I read the report on the jeweler's murder. That's nasty stuff. - Yeah. I think it's Moore again. You know, they hang out right down Ventura at the Reseda Roller Rink. - Did you apply for some surveillance? - No, those guys are so busy. I can't get 'em for a month. - Well, it's only three weeks until you put Moore away for the Shepherd thing. - Well, at his rate, that's three more shootings. - Work, work, work, work. Norma, do you think the guys at your bank talk interest rates when they barbecue? - I know they do. Honey? - Mm. - Let's get the burgers on. Come on. - Look, I'm gonna talk to the chief and see if he can find a couple of guys to spring from the Major Crime Unit for your surveillance. - I could use the help, Jack. - No more cop talk, okay? - Okay. Wanna talk about knitting? - Caroline, I'm going for a quick bite to eat. - All right. (rousing marching music) - Look at that, Tina. Walt Disney. - Aw, boy. - Now there was one hell of an American. - [Tina] Yeah, the guy was incredible. - How'd he think of all that stuff, huh? Movies, cartoons- - Disneyland? - Amusement parks. (gunshots crack) (crowd screaming) - [Tina] Somebody call an ambulance! (monitors beeping) (ventilator hissing) (pensive music) - Joe. It's Tom. Can you hear me? - (grunting) Not gonna testify. - Don't worry about that, Joe. You just get better now. You're gonna be all right. You got 24-hour security. I'm sorry, Joe. (siren wails) Look, Clay, I've got a key witness in intensive care. Let me have the surveillance unit for two weeks. They're gonna hit someone else. - Tom, I got street gangs, arms dealers, some yahoo trying to carve up ladies along Ventura, not to mention narcotics. - Ten days! Clay, they tried to kill my witness. - Four. - Eight. - All right. Jack told me how much you wanna get these guys. You can have a unit for one week. That's it. Nail him, will ya? - Thanks, buddy. (suspenseful music) Okay, watch this guy. - [Cop] Got him. (ominous music) - Get ready now. Hold on now, wait for the signal. - Mr. Schuster! - Johnnie, how are you? - Okay, okay. How are you? - Oh, just fine. - Where you been? - I was in New York. - Oh, oh, great. I thought... - False alarm, guys. Sorry. (tense music) - Mike's gonna cover the front door. - Hey, Ponzi. - Yeah? - I am gonna tell you wife what you said. - [Ponzi] Yeah, right! Have a good night! (suspenseful music) - He's turning into the mini mall. We'll go around the far side. - [Cop] All right, the limo's parking. Pull over and keep him company. - Anything goes down, make sure these kids are out of the way. - [Cop] We copy. - [Cop] This looks like the guy that runs the check cashing shop. - [Cop] Can you believe he's carrying the money with him? - All units, this matches their MO. Get ready. (tense music) - [Cop] We're getting nowhere. Let's go home. - We copy. Let's go. A few more days! - I can't, Tom. - What about Carstairs and Hogan? - They just got requisitioned by Narcotics. Big thing going on in Encino. Besides, your man goes to trial in a week. He's not gonna do anything stupid. - You don't know Johnnie Moore. - Robbery. Yes, he is. One moment, please. Tom, it's your son's school on line five. - Tom Williams. I don't believe this! You stole the little girl's lunch money! - Yes, sir. - But why? Why would you do this? We give you an allowance. - I don't know. - I thought we were bringing you up right. This goes against everything I ever taught you. Don't you know I put people in jail for this? - Gonna put me in jail? - No, but you'll apologize to the girl's parents and to your mother, and there'll be no television for a month. - Daddy? Do you still love me? - Come here, come here, come here. I'll always love you, Ryan. That doesn't mean I'm letting you off the hook. We gotta talk about this, okay? - Okay. - Come on. - [Cop] We're at Ing's Check Cashing, corner of Saticoy and Lindley. We have two wounded. Transporting to emergency room. - They just shot him down and took the cash. - I watched while they planned this. How many men? - I don't know. - Could you identify them? - No! - [Tom] Would you agree to view a lineup? - No! If we helped you, you could not protect us! Leave us alone! - I swear I'm gonna get these guys. - [Game Show Host] Do you have a microwave oven? All right, good! Okay, Susan, roll again. - Hi, Tom. - Joe. (contestant cheers) (audience applauding) - [Game Show Host] Aw, no prize. Sorry, Susan, no prize. - Oh! - How you keeping? (TV clicks off) - On the mend. Got a steel plate in my head that's gonna give me trouble at airports, and a bad need for a good steak they won't let me have, but could've been worse. - Yeah, it could've been. - Yeah. That's why I'm not gonna testify. - I understand. I don't blame you. I'll get the Moore gang. Maybe not on your case, but, uh, one way or the other. See, I got to. They did another number today. They shot up an old couple. They won't testify either. I told them all about our new witness protection program. All expenses paid. I'd be personally responsible for their safety, before and during the trial, but, uh, they're not interested. They're old. See, all I need is one witness. Well, anyway. Don't you be chasing those nurses too much now. Oh, and, uh, if you get really crazy, you call me. I'll, uh... I'll sneak in a steak. Take care, Joe. - I just talked to Ramirez's girlfriend. He's been arrested for armed robbery. Willoughby and some other guy over on Wilshire. - So much for loyalty. That's what he gets. - Damn! This is a bad luck day. Ramirez gets arrested. Those old Chinese live. - We need better pieces. Automatics. - The movie guy won't die. - He'll never testify. - Shepherd ain't the problem. It's that cop. Williams. Without him, their whole case would fall apart. Williams is our bad luck. First order of the day. We gotta get rid of the bad luck. (ominous music) (crowd cheering) - Watch the ball! Defense! Come on, spread out! Ryan, they're coming at you! On your toes! Good! Good man! Seth, coming at ya! Yes! (crowd cheering) Good boy! Yes! - Tom, you did it. You read a couple of books, you turned yourself into a soccer coach. It's amazing. - Jack, never underestimate the power of a library card. - Okay, I gotta go. Good luck with the game. - Hey, you can't go now. It's 1-1. - No, I'm gonna meet some guys from Wilshire. We're gonna try and get in nine holes. Good luck. - All right, thanks. I'll see you later. All right, guys! Come on, come on! (ominous music) - Life teaches us we must do these things right. (Johnnie laughs) - Nice putt. (Jack chuckles) Saw a bumper sticker the other day, said something like, "Time spend playing golf is not time taken off your life, it's a bonus." - Well, we should do this more often then 'cause I could use a bonus. - How are things going in the Crosby murder? - Oh, you know. It's the same old story. Strong suspect but not enough evidence to charge. Then you can't a wiretap, can't get a search warrant. Sometimes you wonder which side the law's on. - I hear ya. - And hell, I mean, even if you get a conviction, it doesn't mean a damn thing. I finally put Vince Arnold away, he gets out on a weekend pass, he kills three people. Same thing with Canset, kills one person. Then Wetherby had his conviction overturned last Thursday. I spent eight months solid on that case. Sometimes you just feel like packing it in. - Yeah, I know what you mean. You're not serious, are you? - Maybe I am. I mean, what am I doing this for? I got an ulcer. I get migraines. I've got a marriage that's hanging by a thread. - What are you gonna do? Security consulting? Write crime novels? Open a bar somewhere? - Maybe. Maybe I will. - You? Oh, get outta here. Look, look. I know the system has glitches, but on some basic level, it works. I believe that and so do you. - [Tanner] What is your occupation, Mr. Bedecki? - I'm a security guard at the Reseda Roller Rink. - And do you know the defendant, Johnnie Moore? - Yes. See him hanging out at the rink. But, like, you know, we're not the closest friends or anything. - As you know, we're interested in your activities on the night that Joe Shepherd was assaulted. Do you recall what you were doing that night? - Yes, I had a party at my house. - At what time was the party? - First people got there about 9. Went to maybe 4 or 5. - And can you tell the court if Mr. Moore was present at your party that night? - Yes, Mr. Moore was at my party. - [Tanner] At what hours do you remember him being there? - He was there from the beginning to the end. - Thank you, Mr. Bedecki. No further questions, Your Honor. - Mr. Bedecki, how many people were at your party? - About 20 or so. - Is this a list of the people that were at your party? - Some of them, yes. - And is this the list that you supplied to Detective Williams? - Yes. - No further questions. Your Honor, I would like to call Detective Tom Williams to the stand. - Well, as the time is late, Ms. Burt-Hopkins, let's save Detective Williams until the next session. Court's adjourned. (ominous music) - $10,000, Rick. I want him dead. Call me when it's done. (engine starts) - You said he'd be back two hours ago. Well, maybe he ain't coming back tonight. - Family home? - Yeah, I could see 'em inside. You want me to take them out? - No, no, no, no, no. I'm not paying for killing no family. The cop first. Come on back here now. - Yeah, okay. - What time he pick his kid up from school? - Every day, 4:45. (school bell rings) (suspenseful music) (kids shouting) (ominous music) - He's right over there. - We'll get him, regular drive-by. - No! We missed him. - He's right there, it'll be easy! Do it! - I said no. That's not the way Johnnie wanted it. We stick to the plan. - You all are gonna let me go to jail! And if I go to jail, we lose everything we got. - We coulda taken him. I wanted to, but Fortino said no. - It wasn't the plan. - To hell with the plan! He was there, we had the opportunity. Davis was ready. Right, Davis? - Hey, Fortino was calling the moves! - All right, all right! Shut up, shut up! I want to change the plan. Lawrence. Fortino tells me you've been doing a good job as a driver. Are you a shooter? I give you a great honor. Get rid of my bad luck. You do this, I make you my right hand. Same setup tomorrow. - So Mr. Bedecki furnished you with a list of the people at his party? Did you contact them? - Yes, I was able to contact 12 of the 16 names given. - And did they tell you that Johnnie Moore was at the party? - No, not one could recall seeing Mr. Moore at the Bedecki party. In fact, seven made the statement that he was not at the party. - [Prosecutor] Thank you, Detective Williams. - Well, sounds to me like you buried the only defense witness, Tom. - I guess but we're not gonna get a conviction without Shepherd's testimony. He's the only eyewitness. - He still hasn't committed? - I've given him the whole sermon. - Well, he'll come around. People do things for you. - Jack, the man took five bullets. But I'm still working on him. (suspenseful music) (kids shouting) - You ready? (gun cocks) Okay, let's go. (engine starts) - We playing this game today? Come on, come on! Come on, open up! Hey! Hey, big guy. Come on! - Not with the kid there. I can't. (tires screech) - God hates a coward, Lawrence. So do I. Get him outta here, Fortino. You bitches ain't no better. - Ryan, you forgot your backpack. Honey, you're going with me. Tom? When are you getting the bike? - The night before his birthday. I don't want him finding it. - Okay, fire engine red, right? - No, no. Candy apple red. - Oh, god, right. He's gonna love it. Honey! You left the door open. - Dad, um, it's Halloween tonight and there's this really special party at Cindy Whitehead's. And there's no school tomorrow, so do you think I could stay out until 2? - 2 o'clock? - But it's Halloween. - Oh, I'm sorry, Susan. - But the party doesn't even hardly start until like midnight. - Then you can come home at 12:30. - (sighs) It's not even worth going. Why do you always have to be such a cop? (upbeat hip hop music) (pensive music) - Please tell the court, when the assailant shot at you, did you believe his intent was to kill you? Was he attempting to murder you? - Yes, I believe he was. - Now, Mr. Shepherd, can you identify the man who stole your money at gunpoint and who fired at you with intent to kill? - Yes. It was Johnnie Moore. (audience murmurs) - The prosecution rests, Your Honor. - It's a nice little house. It's a good town. Should be all right. - Joe, I'm sure we're gonna get a conviction on your testimony. I truly believe you saved a few lives today. - Absolutely. - Well, I don't know about that, but I do know I'll sleep better now. - Thanks, Joe. Thanks. - Take care, Joe. (metal detector beeps) - Hold it a second, sir. (both laugh) - You don't understand. I have a plate in my head. - Mm-hmm. - No, I really do. - [Teacher] Come on, you guys, let's go. Don't eat too many cupcakes. (bright, whimsical music) Careful, don't tear that! Slow down, boys. Let's not run. (girls giggle) (ominous music) - Dad, did you go out for Halloween when you were a kid? - Oh, sure. (tense music) (engine starts) Ryan, get down! (gunfire roars) (bystanders screaming) (tires screech) - Daddy? Daddy? (siren wails) (cops chattering) - [Cop] Ma'am, we're gonna have to ask you- - I'm Mrs. Williams! - [Cop] Mrs. Williams, it would be better if you... Mrs. Williams! - Where's Tom? Where's Tom? - Get away, will ya? Norma, just calm down. - [Norma] He needs me! Please! - Norma, calm down! Calm down. (Norma wails) - Why won't you let me see Tom? - Norma, it's too late! - Where's Ryan? - Ryan's right over there.

They think a white guy did it. (all laugh) - Hey, hey, hey. No way was I gonna let that cop be out enjoying his life while I'm sitting on my ass in a jail. No way, man. - [Jack] I'd like to see what a guy looks like right after he killed a cop. - Come on, man. You screw up the initial questioning, you could blow the whole case. You'll have your chance. - Why'd it have to be Tom Williams, dammit? Why Tom? (sighs) Come on, let's get outta here. George, what do we got? - Nothing much. Only witnesses are kids. They don't now what they saw. They haven't found the car, let alone the gun. - Here they are. Five months of Tom's investigation of the Moore gang. There's photos, records, activities, arrests, charges and convictions. In chronological order. - There are entries on Moore coming in right up to yesterday. Meetings, movements, telephone calls. - My god. Tom was investigating the preparations for his own murder. Thank you, Jean. - Foreperson of the jury, have you reached a verdict? - We have, Your Honor. - The defendant will rise. How do you find the accused on the charges? - On the charge of armed robbery, we find the defendant guilty. On the charge of assault with a deadly weapon, we find the defendant guilty. On the charge of attempted murder, we find the defendant not guilty. (audience murmurs) - [Judge] At this time I would like to thank the jury for their patience and diligent consideration of the facts in this case. - How long will he get? - Without attempted, he could be out in 36 months. - Bailiff will take Mr. Moore to the county jail. Court's adjourned. (gavel bangs) (audience chattering) - [Jack] Who's that girl? - She's a college student. Tanner's assistant. - You gonna be all right, man. - Yeah. (pensive music) Come on, Jack. I'm sure Liz wants you home. - She's not there. She left. - Sorry, I didn't know. - It's okay. It's been a couple weeks. - I'll see you tomorrow, huh? Goodnight. - Right. Goodnight, George. Okay, let's see. How about a nice double Windsor? - Dad likes a half Windsor. - Oh, okay. I'll make a nice half Windsor for you. Okay. - Honey, we're gonna get through this. (police radio squawking) Oh. Ryan, honey, come here. Okay. Remember this day. Remember it well. - [Reporter] More than 1,000 law enforcement officers attended the funeral. Many city officials were also there. The service was held at Our Lady of the Valley Catholic church in Canoga Park. Police officers wore black ribbons around their badges in honor of their slain comrade. During the eulogy, the department chaplain spoke to Williams' six-year-old son Ryan about how his father died. - [Chaplain] Ryan, when that terrible thing occurred, your dad had one thought going through his mind: your safety. - [Reporter] Tom Williams knew someone was trying to kill him, but before he died, he saved his son's life. And when we return, we'll show you the latest footage on that small fire below Mount Wilson. Firefighters were able to contain the flames by this afternoon... ♪ Got to show 'em who you are ♪ ♪ Babe, it's time to shine ♪ ♪ Babe ♪ ♪ Got to show 'em who you are ♪ ♪ Babe, it's time to shine ♪ ♪ Babe ♪ ♪ Got to show 'em ♪ - What do you know about the hit on Detective Williams? - I don't know anything about Detective Williams. - You're saying you never heard of him? - Oh, I heard of him. He was putting a charge on Johnnie. - So Johnny wanted to kill him. - I don't know. Ask Johnnie. - I'm asking you, jerk! - And I said I don't know! - Do you understand conspiracy to murder, Fortino? It means you're in as much trouble as Johnnie. And you could get a life sentence without possibility of parole if you don't talk to us. Now, did Johnnie plan the hit on Detective Williams? - I don't know what you're talking about. - This is just a question of time, JJ. This ain't gonna go away. Sooner or later, somebody's gonna crack. Yeah, somebody'll cut a deal and they'll point the finger, and you're gonna go to jail forever for conspiracy. So tell us what happened. - Hey, I ain't arrested. I don't have to listen to this. I'm outta here. - We're doing you a favor. - (laughs) I got nothing to say. - [Norma] So what? Haven't you learned anything at all? Anything? - We're getting all kinds of information coming in all the time. We're bound to get a break soon. Have you gone back to work? - No. I can't. Susan is barely able to function. There's something I just can't get her to talk about. And Ryan's having nightmares. His birthday is this week and I don't even know if he can handle it. - Is there anything I can do to help? - Yeah, you can get the guy that killed Tom and ruined our lives. Put him where he can't ever do that to anyone else. - Hi, Norma. - Hi, George. - They just arrested Ricky Davis for armed robbery. - This could help us. All right, so Ricky, what do you figure? 10 to 15? You're gonna be an old man before you get out of here. If you cooperate a little bit with us, maybe you'll only be middle-aged. - I tell you, I don't know nothing about the Williams murder. - Detective Williams. Detective Williams. Say it. - Detective Williams. - Yeah, you're a friend of Johnnie Moore's, aren't you? - Yeah, so? - So when's the first time Johnnie Moore talked about killing Detective Williams? - He didn't. I don't know. Look, Johnnie's got power. Just 'cause he's on the inside doesn't mean he can't operate and he's right here in this jail, so forget it. - Well, we can offer you protection. All you gotta do is decide between him and us. - I've got nothing to say. - Oh. Well, then I gotta do what I gotta do. You know, I been a cop a long time, Ricky. I been a cop since you were a little kid. And as soon as you walk outta this room, I'm gonna put it to you. (pensive music) (lock buzzes) (inmates clamoring) He's all yours. I'll be seeing you, Ricky. Kid's dynamite. We're in great shape now. - Look, man, I gotta get me a newspaper, see what they saying about me. (laughs) Hey, man, you hear me? I'm talking to you. - [Cellmate] I hear you. - What you doing in here anyway? You kill somebody? - My schoolteacher. - (laughs) You killed a schoolteacher? - She used to bug me a lot in class. So one day, I broke her neck. (Johnnie laughs) What'd you do? - Killed a cop. Yeah, but my man thinks I'm gonna get off. No one will testify. (Johnnie laughs) My man. (ominous music) - Davis. I hear they're coming for you, man. When you're asleep. Take care. - Thanks. (trays clatter) (inmates whoop) I want protection until the trial. And no new charges if I talk. Immunity, okay? - What do you got? - It was during the trial when Johnnie saw we were being watched. He said he wouldn't go to jail if Detective Williams was dead. So Johnnie sent us to find out where he lived, where his kids go to school, where he stopped for coffee, what time he came home. We made a couple of tries. Last time we were all lined up, but Armstrong- - Lawrence Armstrong? - Yeah, couldn't pull the trigger. - Next day, Johnnie decided to do it all himself. - Johnnie Moore shot Detective Williams? - Yeah. - You're gonna show us this house and I'm gonna find out if you're messing with me. - Take the next right. - Is this the street? - Make another right. That's it, that's it! The tan one. Johnnie brought me here before. Said he'd give me $10,000 to kill a guy when he came home. - Okay. You say you called him from a payphone? - Yeah. It's a couple blocks down. I couldn't see the house when I talked to him. - Okay. Here's the call to Moore, October 27th, 10:45 p.m. Okay. - I was getting shaky by then. Glad he decided not to do the family. - What did you say? - When I called, we talked about doing the family. Then Johnnie said he wasn't paying for no family. "First the cop." - The family? He was gonna kill the whole family? - Don't know. Johnnie's pretty crazy sometimes. (pensive music) - Yeah! (kids shouting) (Tom's voice echoing) - [Tom] Head up now! Heads up! Volley the the ball! Good boy! Attaboy, Ryan! Good one! Yes! (laughs) - "First the cop"? Now, to me, that implies the family later. Your Honor, Moore is perfectly capable of directing hits on witnesses and enemies from jail. - His attorney would raise absolute hell. - Your Honor... Excuse me, Your Honor, but this guy has already tried to kill one witness. And I've got an informant that says he personally hit Tom Williams. Put him in solitary for one week, and I'll get Moore. - I'm sorry, gentlemen. We just don't have the legal grounds. - 3-2? That's a heck of a lot better than like 10-2 or something. Have you played those guys before? - Yeah. They always beat us. - Oh yeah? Well... Oh, wait, your mother's cleaning the floors. She said go around the back. What was the score last time? - Four to nothing. - Well, you see there? This is closer, so next time, maybe you'll beat 'em. - I did make a couple good saves. - Did you? Well, that's good, 'cause a save is just as important as a goal. In fact, anybody can kick the ball through for a goal, but only one guy, the goalie, can make a save. - Next time we're gonna beat 'em by four, maybe five! - [All] Surprise! - Happy birthday, Ryan. (crowd applauding) - Happy birthday! - Happy birthday, kiddo! - Happy birthday, big guy! (bright music) - All right! - Oh! Is that the right color? - Perfect! - Oh, good. Check it out, check it out. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! Yeah! (crowd applauds) (somber music) (upbeat hip hop music) - [Operator] 911. - Yeah, police? - [Operator] Yes, it is. May I help you? - I know something about a murder. - [Operator] Yes? What murder? - Yeah! Yeah, yeah, right! Yeah, thanks man. Great, great. - What are you doing, Lawrence? - I made a call, man. My man's got some tickets. - Lawrence. Don't you know if nobody talks, Johnnie'll be free in a couple years. You know that? - Yeah... Excuse me, man. Sorry. - But you're the problem. You're the weak link. We're worried about you. (woman screams) (glass crashes) - So JJ Barlow always supplied the weapons? - Yeah, that's right. Fortino did a couple of times, but for the Williams hit, it was always JJ. - Where's the gun that killed Detective Williams? - I don't know. JJ would keep 'em somewhere. Just before a job, he'd call and then go and get 'em. After, he'd call again and then drop 'em off. - And you never saw where he took 'em? - Well, he took me along once, but I don't remember where. - Don't screw around with us, Armstrong. Answer the question. - I don't remember! A house somewhere in the Hills. - Okay, wait, hold it. Here. Yeah, it says a phone call here from Moore's house 40 minutes before and then again 25 minutes after Tom's murder to Rich Atterley, 1052 Beechmont Avenue. Is this the house where he kept the guns? - Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah, that's the house. - Okay, let's go get a search warrant. We've got you cold, JJ. You're going up for murder one. A police detective in cold blood. You're gonna get the gas, Barlow. - Wasn't me, I swear. I got it for Johnnie. I gave it to Johnnie. - You're gonna swear to that in court? - Yeah. (suspenseful music) (lock buzzes) - Johnnie Moore, I take great pleasure in charging you with the first-degree murder of Detective Thomas Williams. Gotcha, Johnnie. - Are you gonna stay with us a long time? - Just till we're sure you're safe. Here we go. - Thanks. I'll go get the other one. - Norma, I noticed the paint's a little rough out back. The house could use a coat. - No, I don't want to paint the house. Why would I paint the house? - No, I mean we would do it. - Of course not, Cliff. Look, thanks, but you guys have been doing enough, okay? Hi, can I help you? - I'm Shirley Stell. I called yesterday. - Oh, yeah. Come on in. I've been trying to pack up some stuff. Somebody said I should. I don't want to. It's been sitting here for days. I guess eventually I'll get to it. Sit down. See, I've got this little technique. I, um... I don't really let myself quite believe it yet. He's just away on a trip or something. I'm gonna hold onto that for awhile. - I remember when I packed away all of Paul's stuff. His photographs and the awards and certificates. But a couple of months ago, I pulled 'em out and put 'em all up again. Hey, what the hell? I'm proud of him. There are a couple of us that get together every once in a while. We're all wives of murdered cops. We don't like the term "widows." Would you like to meet the others? It'd be good for you. - No, no. I don't think so. Not now. You know, there is something though. There, um... There's a part of me that I've never really felt before. When I think of Johnnie Moore, I want him dead. I want him dead and gone off the face of the earth. - We all felt that way. But it will eat you up. It will eat up your whole life. For yourself and for your kids, you have got to try to get that anger, that bitterness, all that stuff, you've got to try to put it behind you. - I'm not ready yet. Oh, hi. Will you sit with me? - Well, I would, but they won't let me in there because I'm a potential witness from working on the case. Are you sure you feel up to this? - I'm not sure what I'm up to. - Now, the murder of Detective Williams is unique in the annals of police history. Approximately 160 police officers fall every year in the line of duty nationwide, most gunned down in a violent confrontation with a criminal element. But Detective Williams was stalked, surveilled, and selected. A calculated, cold-blooded, premeditated act of vengeance against a police officer who had merely done his job too well. (Tanner clears throat) - Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, under our system of justice, my client, Johnnie Moore, is presumed innocent. Innocent. That is where you must begin if you are to live up to your oath as jurors. Now, I sympathize with the prosecution in their predicament. Great pressure has been brought to bear on them for a conviction in this horrible case. And I understand the things they will resort to. I understand it, but I do not condone it. I submit that the state's case will rest completely on evidence you will hear given by a band of thieves and criminals who are making deals, trying to save their own necks. Now, the most important question you must later ask yourself is: has the state proven beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of my client, Johnnie Moore? I submit to you they will not. - Garrett, have a look at this. - Your Honor, this notice which is being circulated by the friends of Johnnie Moore offers a $10,000 reward for anyone, and I quote, "With information leading to the arrest of the Latino and Caucasian men that killed Detective Tom C. Williams, and for anyone with information as to why the witnesses Davis, Armstrong, and Barlow would lie on Johnnie Moore." Now, it is the prosecution's position that this notice constitutes an open contract for a hit on these witnesses. - Your Honor, that is ridiculous. This notice is an absolutely innocent attempt by Mr. Moore to obtain evidence. - Furthermore, the prosecution requests that so these witnesses will not be intimidated, Mr. Moore be placed in solitary confinement, and bar him from any further communication except with his attorney for the duration of the trial. - Your Honor, this is ludicrous. - I'm sorry, Mr. Jamieson, I must deny your request. - The man's conducting a campaign of intimidation! - You have insufficient legal grounds for such a conclusion. I'm sorry. - Now, Mr. Barlow, I want you to inspect this automatic assault pistol. You recognize it? - I'm not sure. - Not sure? We have your signed statement witnessed by Detective Lowe and Rivera. - Objection, Your Honor. I'd like that statement stricken from the record. - Sustained. Jury members, please disregard that last statement. - Why don't you take another look, Mr. Barlow? Isn't this the weapon, fully loaded, that you gave to Johnnie Moore on the day he went to kill Tom Williams? - Objection! - Sustained. Be more careful in your statements, Mr. Jamieson. - Mr. Barlow. Mr. Barlow! Isn't this the same weapon that you gave to Johnnie Moore on the day Tom Williams was killed? - I don't know. - Excuse me, Your Honor. May I approach the bench? I'm sorry, Your Honor, but there is a show of emotion in the courtroom which I believe will bias the jury. Now, I can understand how difficult this is for Mrs. Williams, but in the interest of justice for my client, I must move to have her barred from the courtroom. - Your Honor, it's all right. I'll go. (audience whispering) - I'd like to request a recess, Your Honor. - Court adjourned until 2 p.m. (audience chattering) - We are gathered here in the sight of God to join this man and this woman together in the state of holy matrimony. Who has the ring? - [Man] Right here. - [Justice] Janie Wickshaw, do you take Johnnie as your lawfully wedded husband? - I do. - [Justice] And do you, Johnnie, take Janie as your lawfully wedded wife? - I do. - I now pronounce you husband and wife. - You did establish it as the murder weapon and it was in the possession of Barlow, who supplied the guns to Moore. - Yeah, but it's still not a direct link. - My husband is innocent. It's been a frame-up. - And who do you think framed him? - The police, the prosecution, everybody. But I'm confident the jury will see this. - And when will you get a honeymoon? - Johnnie's serving time on some other minor charges, but it looks like he'll be out soon enough. Then we'll go somewhere very private. - Davis and Armstrong have received threats and they've seen the reward notice. They're refusing to testify. - What? - They can't do that. - What's going on? - Oh, we've got a little problem here. (pensive music) Hi, Anton. How's it going? - Not bad, Jack. And you? - Never better. Anton, we've always been straight with each other, right? - I've been straight with you. - I want to ask you something. You're in a cell with Johnnie Moore. Did he ever talk to you about Detective Tom Williams? - All the time. He told me he killed him. - Anton, I got no deal for you. You're a lifer. You're never going back on the street again. - I was just answering your question. - Yeah. Did he give you any details? Do you think you could testify in court for me? - Can't do it. This is where I live. - I hear you. - Jack. Would you do me a favor? Get him out of my cell. He's starting to bug me. - I'll do what I can. But listen, I want you to think about this for me. This guy Moore, who wanted to kill the kid too. That just ain't right. (pensive music) (light knock at door) (ominous music) (intruder chuckles) (Johnnie laughing) - Mom! Mom! (Johnnie laughing) Mom! Mom! - Honey, it's okay. Mommy's here. It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. - What's going on? - He's just having another nightmare. It's all right. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. (pensive music) - Look, all I'm saying is it's gotta be finished before the marble gets here. Detective Lowe? I'm Leo Schuster. Thanks for coming. - How are you? This is Detective Rivera. - How do you do? - How do you do? You know who Janie Wickshaw is, right? - I do. You say she came to your house? - Said she was a messenger from Johnnie Moore. I hired Johnnie a few times as my driver. He was dependable. Intelligent. At one point a few months ago, he had asked if I wanted to invest $65,000 in his business. He wanted to buy another limousine. I told him I'd think about it, but I had no real interest. Next thing I know, this Janie Wickshaw girl comes to me and asks for money. She said something real bad would happen to me if I didn't pay up. I thought she was joking. But she showed a list and said I'd believe it when some of the others start to die. I wrote down the ones I could remember. - Davis, Armstrong, Barlow. Jack Lowe. Prosecutor Jamieson? I'll call Garrett Jamieson and tell him a protection unit is on the way. - Yeah, I hear we both made the hit parade. Judge Goldstein just called. She decided to grant our request and place Moore in solitary confinement. No paper, pencils, calls, or visitors other than his attorney. - Garrett, that's great. Maybe we can start turning this thing around. (inmates clamoring) - Hey, what's going on? What is this, huh? Huh? What's going on? (ominous music) I want to call my attorney. I have the right to call my attorney. I want my attorney right now! You get him on the phone! Call my attorney! I'm not going in there! I'm not going! I'm not going! Call my attorney! I'm not going in there! No! No! You get that man on the phone! You get him on the... You're dead! You're dead! You're dead! I got you, you're dead! - All right, look. I've got Moore in solitary. And I mean for good. His power is gone. His not giving any orders, he's not paying for any hits, and everyone on the street knows this. I'm the one with the power now. - So? - So from now on when this man asks you questions in court, I want straight answers. No more of this crap! Hi. - Jack, hi. - Hey, Cliff told me he offered to help you here but you threatened to drench him when he asked. - Oh, I'm getting a reputation, huh? - Yeah, well, it's understandable. How are you? - Same. I've packed up some of his things and, uh... They've been here for a week. I don't know whether to throw 'em out or give 'em to the Salvation Army or put 'em back up where they belong. (sighs) I guess they'll just sit here forever. - Well, let 'em sit. (Norma sighs) - Yeah, well. The truth is I'm just barely treading water. I'm not a helpless person, you know. I had a job. I could make things work. And now I can't do anything. I can't even go to court. - Oh, that's why I came over, Norma. I think you should go back to court. Here's why. This guy Moore's got his whole family in there every day, and believe it or not, it's getting him points. - Well, Jack, I want to be there. I'm just not sure if it's the best thing. I mean, these days, Cliff offers to grill me a hamburger and I'm crying. - Involvement would be the best thing for you, Norma. I know it's the best thing for our case, and I think it's what you really want. - Yes, I want to go back to court. I just don't want to screw up again. - Do you want me to come with you? - Would you? Oh, that would be great. - I'll see you tomorrow. (pensive music) Some of the other members of the group. - Thank you. Thank you for coming. - Your Honor, Norma Williams is present in the courtroom and I would ask that the court order be enforced. - What court order, Counselor? I never ordered Norma Williams from the court. She went voluntarily and is free to return, and frankly I'm glad she has. Let's go. - Your Honor, before the jury returns, my client wishes to make a statement. - Proceed. - As God is my witness, I have been horribly mistreated. I have been put in a hole with no access to my new bride. Or my brother or my aunt. It smells bad and I can't see the sky. I am innocent and I don't accept this. I am asking the court to reinstate my privilege of an open cell, exercise periods, visitors, and the use of a telephone. - Denied. On to business. - Yes, it's true. The defendant offered me 10,000 to kill Detective Tom Williams. - And is it also true that on three separate days, you were on stakeouts organized by Johnnie Moore with the express purpose of murdering Tom Williams? - Yes, it's true. - So you're telling me that Johnnie Moore gave you the weapon and ordered you to kill Detective Williams in front of that school? For how much? - $10,000. - $10,000? That's a lot of money. You had the loaded weapon. You had Tom Williams in your sights. Why didn't you pull the trigger? - His son was in the car. His son was smiling up at him. I couldn't do it. - [Garrett] Now, Mr. Barlow, you recognize this weapon, don't you? - Yes. - [Garrett] To whom did you give this weapon on October 31st? - To Johnnie Moore. - [Garrett] Did he tell you exactly what he was gonna do with the weapon? - Yes. (clears throat) He said he was gonna kill Tom Williams. - Mr. Barlow. I believe you as well as Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Davis are currently under indictment for some very serious crimes. Is that true? - Yes, sir. - And Mr. Barlow, do you believe that your present testimony will help in your personal case? - Objection. - Sustained. (pensive music) - Johnnie told me he got the MAC-10 ready on the seat. When Detective Williams came around the truck, he drove by, stopped, and fired from close. He said that when he started blasting on him, his legs this way, his arms went thataway. He laughed when he told me this. Johnnie said he picked the gun up again. Even though he knew the man was dead, he fired another burst into him. He looked for his little boy to blast him too, 'cause he said he'd probably grow up to be a cop just like his father. But he didn't see him. He started his car again, and it started and he drove away. - Mr. Reddick, why do you expect us to believe that Johnnie Moore told you all this? - I don't know. - Well, perhaps more to the point, why are you telling us this? Have you been promised something for your cooperation? - No, I wasn't promised anything. - They why, Mr. Reddick, would you possibly be so helpful to the people who would sentence my client to death? - Anyone who would go to kill a little kid... Maybe he should die. - Foreperson of the jury, have you reached a verdict? - We have, Your Honor. - Will the defendant please rise? Will you please read the verdict? - On the charge of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit the murder of Detective Tom Williams, we find the defendant, Johnnie Moore, guilty. (pensive music) (audience chattering) (gavel bangs) - Court is adjourned pending sentencing. - Way to go. - Will they ask me any questions? - No, honey, not in court. - Will I have to do anything? - No. I just want you to sit quietly and listen, and remember. - I will, Mama. - Okay, honey. You look very handsome. Go get your coat. - I'm not going. - Susan, we're in this thing. You can't turn your back now. I want you to be there. - I just can't. I can't go there and see that man and think about what he did to Dad. - You've got to learn to face the evil in this world, just like Daddy did. - There's something that I didn't tell you. We argued that last day. The last time that I saw him. I said some really stupid things. I can't even remember the last time I told him that I loved him. And now he's gone. - Honey. Your daddy loves you so much. Do you think one conversation could change that? Suzy, I want you to come to court. On October 31st last year at 5:40 p.m., my life and the lives of my children were shattered. Tom was my best friend, my lover, and the best husband any woman could ask for. I kept asking myself, "How could this happen? How could anyone do this?" But now I have seen Johnnie Moore, the animal who has done this thing, and who sits there smugly without any display of remorse. And no matter what happens to this man, for us, the pain and anguish of losing Tom will continue. Every holiday, every birthday, every Father's Day, every wedding anniversary, and every Halloween for the rest of our lives. Thank you. - Thank you, Mrs. Williams. - Your Honor, I'm Susan Williams. I'd like to say something. - All right, please. My father was a brave, loving, caring man. We had a bond that could never be broken. He was always there for me when I needed him. But not anymore. Now he's gone. He will never be with me, for my prom or my graduation or for my wedding day, because of what this man has done. I'm very proud of my dad, for who he was and what he stood for. And I will always, always love him. Thank you. (sniffles) - I've been praying for Norma Williams and her children, and I don't blame them for what they say. I too have known pain, God knows. But this verdict was calculated before this trial even started. I was convicted before I was even tried. I am not without sin, but neither are all of you. Well. I just hope you can reach a decision on my sentence that you can live with. My life is on the line. This is for real. Now, some of you people look religious. When you stand before God at the end of your journey, if you decide to execute me, I want you to think what is going to be your closing argument to him. (somber music) - [Narrator] Johnnie Moore was sentenced to execution by gas. He is on California's Death Row. The Medal of Valor, the LAPD's highest award for bravery, was awarded posthumously to Tom Williams for saving his son's life. With the active participation of Norma Williams in the campaign, California became the first state to ban sales and possession of assault weapons including the MAC-10 that killed Tom Williams. On May 20th, 1992, Ryan Williams joined the Police Explorer Program with the Los Angeles Police Department. He hopes to become a police officer. (wistful music) (bright jingle) (soft jingle)
