(suspenseful music) (beeping) (upbeat music) (eerie music) - How much further to the funeral home? - Not far. Say kids, where are you from anyway? - Manhattan. - Manhattan, are you serious? - Are you writing a fucking book? You're being paid to drive, so drive. - Cool it Michele. - I just hate funerals, that's all. It's Calvin, that makes it worse. - Hell, we haven't seen each other in years. Figures it has to be over something like this. - I know. I miss having the five of us together. - Shit, we're not gonna see his family again are we? I don't think they like us too much. - No, I arranged for a private viewing. Technically the funeral home's closed. Full viewing's not 'til tomorrow. - Really? How'd you arrange that one? Money talks, bullshit walks, huh? Same old Kristof. - Why doesn't Calvin's family like us anyway? - We're the ones who got him into all the paranormal stuff. According to them we led their precious little boy down the wrong path. - Yeah, what about all the coke he did. - That's so unfair. We haven't even seen him in years. - Not since high school. - They don't care. - What happened anyway, Calvin I mean? - He was Haiti, getting into the whole Vodou scene, doing research like the rest of us. They say he took a swim late one night and misjudged the undertow and ended up out in the reef. But I'm a hopeless romantic. I'd like to think he got drunk one night and got pushed off a boat by a jealous lover. - Really? Male or female? - Well the woman would be more apt to use a knife, stabbing the wound as they say. So I'd have to say it was a man. - Oo, nice sexual innuendo. - Could we possibly not talk about this? We're going to his funeral, remember? - What do you think we'd be saying if it was your funeral? - Good point. (thunder crashes) - You know what? I spent two nights at Mount Hope Cemetery last year trying to record electromagnetic phenomena. Didn't think twice about being there. - And? - And this place here would creep me out during the day. - Come on Allie, we'll say our goodbyes and we're outta here. - Yeah, if you say so. - This place seems familiar. Anybody feel like we're being watched? - From where? - There. - Somebody's there. - [Michele] Maybe it was the wind. - [Allie] It wasn't the wind. - Yeah, then what was it, a ghost? - Hey guys, this is a place of business, right? There's gotta be a funeral director or somebody to let us in. They're not just gonna gimme the keys and let me lock up. - That depends on how much you tip them. - Yeah, if the funeral director's watching us then why doesn't he just come down here and let us in? - Do you want me to wait out here 'til you're done? - No, I'll give you a call on me cell phone when we're ready to go. Don't wander off too far. - You're the boss. My condolences to the dearly departed. - Okay I just wanna get this over with. I think I'm gonna have to powder my nose here in a sec. Christ let this night go by quick. (tense pop music) - [Man] They're going inside. - [Man] Got any idea what's going on? - I don't have any fuck what's going on. It's a funeral home so I'm guessing it's a funeral, right? - Those sick bastards. They'd go to a funeral home for a freaking sleepover. - I go to college with one of those guys. Kristof St. Pierce, he's their little ring leader. They go all over the world and stay in haunted houses and stuff like that. Meanwhile I have a partial football scholarship and I'm pumping gas at Marley's. Must be nice to have that kinda cash. - Yeah okay, so I get the part about their doing the Scooby-Doo shit, what I'm trying to figure is why we followed them out here to bumfuck Egypt. - (laughing) Here. Figure this out instead. - Okay. - I'll tell you why we followed these guys all the way out here. One of their little buddies died. And they arranged for a special viewing out here tonight in the sticks. I overheard Kristof talking about it to somebody on his cell phone last week in the commissary. So I figure, shit, this place is in the middle of nowhere, probably the caretaker's the only guy around to let the kids in, it's perfect. - Perfect. For what? - We're gonna screw with these rich fucks. - Don't you think that's kinda sick, Bill? I mean messing with these guys at their friend's funeral. - Bill, why do you wanna screw with them anyway? - Because that asshole Kristof has banged just about everyone in school, and that includes Marlene, recently. She told me she was at some prison group 'til 3:00 a.m. one morning, so I checked it out. Turns out the only thing she was prisoning was how many times that rich piece of shit could bang her in the ass. (laughing) So I guess you could say I'm a little pissed off! - What's the plan? - We're gonna fuck with these guys tonight. And if I get Kristof alone, I promise you, I will use his empty freaking head as a skull keg. Anybody who wants to leave had better do it now. - [Kristof] Hello? Is anybody here? - [Michele] At this point I'd settle for someone telling us to come back tomorrow. - Well at this point I'd settle for a god damn light switch. - Just relax guys, go with the flow. You said you wanted something different. And this is it. - Are you for real, Kristof? - Kristof what the hell is wrong with you? Your best friend in the whole world is dead. I know people have a weird way of dealing with grief but this is just crazy. This is not new and different, it's a god damn funeral. - Do you think Calvin would want us moping around and crying over him? I don't. - Well I sure as hell would. - I remember. - [Allie] Remember what? - I remember this place, the Hawthorne Funeral Home. - Oo was that a heavy date? - I read a big spread about it in the New England Historical Chatbook. This place is a historical landmark. - Every place in New England is a god damn historical landmark. - Well there's a reason why this place is so far away from anywhere. That's why it stuck out in my mind. That's why I remember reading about it. - What's the reason? - I can't remember. I blame NutraSweet. - Really? I blame the cocaine and maybe the ecstasy. - This place is built on what used to be Blood Prison. - Blood Prison? - Blood Prison was a secret jail the diehard puritans built back in the 1600s. They used to torture and kill alleged witches and heretics here, even after the colonies outlawed the practice. That's why it was secret. Instead of tearing it down when they built the funeral home, they just built it right over the prison. I guess you could still walk down there, but I don't think anybody's gonna be giving us a guided tour. - Is now a good time for this? - Anyway, they still had to unload some of their dead, so the Hawthornites used it to bury some of the criminals that had died in the stacks. And of course, the witches. No grave markers. - She's right. - How do you know all that? - This area's big on folklore and that's my bag. - Well figures only fucking Calvin would end up having his funeral in a place where they used to kill witches. What a guy, huh? - Yeah well thanks for the history lesson, but can we find the viewing room now? I wanna pay my respects and I wanna get the hell outta this place. - [Kristof] I think I found it. (doors creaking) - [Man] Still no sign of that damn funeral director. (gentle music) - Funny how it never hits you until you're standing here looking down at the dead person. - Well what did you expect? - I've been to a few funerals before, but, never someone my age and never one of my friends. This is bad. - Remember how he was always cracking his stupid fucking jokes? - Yeah, I remember. - I could sure use one now. - Me too. - Shit, I always thought I'd go first. - You can go second. (laughs) - We shoulda brought some booze. I think Calvin woulda wanted a full out Irish wake. - Yeah well I'm just glad his parents aren't here. I don't think I could deal with that right now. - You were a good man Calvin. I hope you got to do what you wanted to do. Even though you died too soon. I hope we did you some justice. What the fuck? - You could have at least buried me with a fifth of jack, ya cheap bastards. (laughing) - [Guy] Kristof what the hell is going on? - This is a fucking joke, isn't it? - Well I have to admit you sure got me. I think I wet my fucking pants. - [Michele] How did you guys set all this up? - What? I'm not really dead. - I poured my heart out to you! - Yeah, I know. That's why I had to stop the joke so soon. You were killing me. I thought I was gonna blow it. - Aw, and if I know how this works, and I do, the criminal mastermind behind this is you, Kristof. - Yeah, it was me. My dad owns the place as of 8:00 p.m. yesterday. It was too perfect to resist. - Okay, that explains how you do it, but not why. - Hell, we haven't seen each other in five years. We're all off doing our own research. I tried calling you, setting something up just to get back together like the old days, but I would've even settled on dinner. - I'm still confused. - One of us dying was the only sure fire way we could think of to get us all in the same room together. So here we are. (sighs) - Okay losers, I forgive you. - Yeah, me too. - Not me, you lousy bastards. But I can be bribed. (laughing) - Can you believe this crazy shit? They staged a fucking funeral. - Yeah well, I wanna see what they're up to, then we'll get 'em. - Well now that that's settled, let me take you on a guided tour of the place. We'll find some place to sit down and shoot the shit. Down in the old prison. - Why? - I swear to god Calvin, if you ever pull this again I will personally pay to have you cremated. - They're going into the old prison. Behind the funeral home. - Let's go. (door creaking) (eerie music) - Did we really have to come back here to the prison? This place gives me the creeps. - Could you imagine it way back when? It's so amazing. - Can we settle down kids? We have some important things to discuss. - Like what? - Like is anyone interested in making a cool million in cash? - Oh goody, another bullshit scheme, compliments of Kristof. - No, this isn't another bullshit scheme. As you know my dad's paper-- - You mean bullshit rag? (group chuckles) - Yeah, bullshit rag. Anyway, he just got the top slot in the distribution racks nationwide and he's planning on having this big to do to set things off. And I found out about this little contest he's planning on having. - Okay, your dad's paper. Let's just, so we're on the same page here, this is the one that claims they supposedly found proof that Tiny Tim was the anti-Christ, right? - I love the one about the half man, half frog that was living in Parsippany, New Jersey. - Hey, me too. The frog man. That was a real keeper. - Guys, back to the subject, please? Hey guys can we settle down? Anyway, the paper's gonna publicize a contest for a million dollars for anyone who could establish physical evidence of the tallon key and bring it to the paper. - The tallon key? - The tallon key. What, you've never heard of the legend? - I did. It's big around these parts. The tallon key. The old timers say there were some men buried out here in the 1700s that are supposed to watch over the land or some bullshit like that. And there was a key and it's supposed to open... That door right there, the tallon key. Right? - Alright, first of all, it wasn't just some guys. They were the three executioners for Blood Prison. And the townspeople were so freaked out about what they did to the witches back then, that they made a special cell to hold the evil in. - Oh right and little Linda Blair was possessed by the devil and they had to call the exorcist. - Shut up. - Yeah anyway, they buried the three executioners with the key in order to keep the evil at bay. And no one's ever found the bodies or the key. That's why my dad bought the place. He's planning on charging admission so every Tom, Dick and Harry can come in here and dig the place up. And he's gonna make a hell of a lot more than a million dollars off of that. - Okay so why do you need us? - Friends and family of the paper aren't eligible to win the million dollars. Right? - Right. The money's for you guys. I'm not interested in that. It's my present to you all. - Yeah so what's the catch? - There's two things. First of all, this is our scene. This is our thing. We've searched the world for proof of something like this. - You know Kristof, I'd be a little embarrassed if I had to tell somebody I was doing extensive paranormal research on the old tallon key. If you know what I mean. (chuckles) - The tallon key. - Yeah. - Right. Well my dad doesn't believe any of it either. If he did he wouldn't put up that kind of money. On the other hand, I do. And if I can prove its existence, he can't say anything else about our little paranormal society. That's why I made the spare set of keys and that's why I set this up. - You've got this whole thing figured out, don't you? - Just the hard parts. That's why I like the occult so much. - Are we playing Parcheesi? - What's this? - A Ouija board. With any luck it'll help me find what I'm chasing tonight. - Why would you use this? - Because it might lead us in the right direction. - You know, I'm not sure this is the world's greatest idea. - Well I am. It's time to make something happen. - Make what happen exactly? - I can't believe this. I'm sitting with four of the biggest students of the paranormal world and you guys are wimping out on me. I'm really disappointed. - You're disappointed? Wait 'til I show back up at my folks' house and tell my mother that Calvin didn't even die. She's gonna be really pissed. She sent over $300 worth of condolence flowers to Calvin's father's house. - And do I really have to be a part of this? - [Michele] Do any of us? - [Calvin] Come on, let's give Krisof a chance. - Dude, you don't even get a say in this, you're dead. - I can't do this by myself. - [Allie] Why not? - Rules of the game, right? You channel a spirit through yourself alone it can take control of you. More people channeling the safer you are. - Spirits huh? The way I understand it the Ouija board is just your subconscious telling you what it wants you to hear. Right? - That's what they say anyway. - So why would Parker Brothers put out a device that'll let you talk to spirits, huh? They make Monopoly for Christ's sakes. - Alright, so if it's just your subconscious, you go first. - I don't want anything to do with this. - [Kristof] Allie? Please? - I don't wanna touch it. - [Kristof] Nobody's ever died from using a Ouija board before. - I still don't wanna touch it. (gasps) - See? Allie I need your help. You're my friend. So as my friend, I'm asking you, help me. (tense music) You won't regret it. (man scoffs) - If it's another one of your brilliant schemes, maybe she will. - [Allie] What's that? - It's the other part of the experiment. - We're gonna play Pictionary? - Very funny. No actually it's when it stops on a letter we're gonna jot it down. It might be gibberish but it could also be a message. - [Allie] What exactly does that mean? if the conditions are right? - Just relax. - [Allie] (gasps) Did you feel that? Did you just move the planchette? - [Kristof] I didn't. (unsettling music) - I'm in. - Me too. - Grab the pen and pad. - Why? - You're the stenographer. - Newsflash, I don't wanna write anything either. - Rory just do it. When it stops on a letter, jot it down. - [Rory] Alright. - Now don't press down. Just let it go where it wants to go. If it wants to go. Just close your eyes and concentrate. - [Rory] Does this mean I have to close my eyes too? - No, it means you have to shut the fuck up, Rory. - [Allie] It's moving. - Let it move. Don't talk, don't think. - [Calvin] Don't you have to ask it a question first? - Not always. Sometimes the spirits ask you a question, sometimes it already knows the answer. (suspenseful music) G. A. T. E. - [Calvin] You're doing this, aren't you? - No. - I'm scared. - No commentary, please. W. - Uh, did any of you catch the weather forecast for this evening? - Calvin, be quiet, please! - What's happening? - [Kristof] A. - [Rory] Say, are any of you guys gonna come back to the real world anytime soon? - [Allie] What's happening? I feel strange. - I don't know. Just go with it. - [Kristof] Y. It spells gateway. Just like the computer. Whoa man, this is totally weird. - Yeah, no shit Kristof. This is getting a little outta hand. - Alright, everybody relax. It's just a storm. Alright, everybody stay relaxed. We just need to find a flashlight or some candles. - I've got a Zippo. - Cool trick, Calvin. - See? This is why I don't do funerals. - Yeah Kristof it's been real, it's been fun, but it ain't been real fun. So why don't you call the freaking limo? - Fine, we'll put it to a vote. Michele and Rory wanna leave. Calvin and I wanna stay. Allie, it's up to you. - Hey, don't look at me. I'm ready to go whenever anybody else is. - [Michele] What's her problem? - [Kristof] Did somebody slip something to Allie earlier? - Hey, how come every time someone ODs around here it's automatically my fault? - What the fuck was that all about? - Shh! Nevermind, keep you god damn voice down. - Yeah, but what happened to the lights in the storm? - That prick Kristof's up to some stupid shit. Might put a crimp in our plans. - Yeah, but did you hear what they said about that reward? It's a million bucks. - Let's get away from this window before we get caught. (tense music) (speaking in foreign language) - Is that Latin? - Sounds like bullshit to me. - Maybe she's epileptic. - Well I've known Allie for about 10 years and as far as I know she's not an epileptic. - Oh please Kristof, you know this is part of your stupid fucking joke. How long are you gonna make her do this? - Look, the joke's over, okay? - Look Kristof, no offense, but I'd say old Michele has a point here. I mean after you get us all out here to review Calvin's remains, you're not exactly the pillar of truth. - [Kristof] Explain the storm then. - Pardon mwah, but it's bullshit coochies. - I'm not making all this up. - Come on Kristof! I mean between your so called jokes and this seance shit in the old haunted prison, I mean you have us so freaked out you know we're gonna believe anything. - [Kristof] You know that's not what happened. - No, I don't know that's not what happened. - There's no way on Earth Calvin and I made all this up and as for Allie here, I don't know what's the matter with her. We might have to take her to a hospital. - You know, I wanna go home. I wanna put on something three inches long. I wanna hit every fucking club in Manhattan until dawn. - Okay, okay, so let's say that's not part of your joke. What do we do now? - Allie, are you okay? - Yeah. I'm fine, I just blinked out for a second. - Maybe we should take you to a doctor. (startling tone) - Shit! - Oh come on Calvin, gimme a break. Knock the fuck off, what are you eight? - I saw something outside the window. - [Kristof] I don't see anything. - Seriously, it darted past like it was running. - Oh, maybe it was the yeti. - Yeah? And maybe I'm gonna put a size 11 mudhole in your ass, Rory. - Hey Calvin, find your happy place, okay? This isn't helping anything. Just tell me what you saw. - I don't know. It was definitely a guy or a person, you know? I couldn't really see. That was it. - Well maybe just to be on the safe side, we should go outside to check to see who our visitor is. - Call me nuts, but just on the safe side, shouldn't you get out your cell phone and call 911 and get the cops in on this? - Not an option. If the cops come here they're gonna wanna talk to my dad. That's for sure. And I didn't exactly borrow the keys, if you know what I mean. - Oh, then we should go. - No, we shouldn't go. The limo doesn't come until I call it. - Great. Then you can sit here and yank on your Ouija. While we split. We have legs, we can walk. - By the time you get back to town, it'd be sunrise. And I think I heard a storm coming. You wanna walk back to town in a storm? - Fine, then I can stay here with the god damn door locked. - Well I'm gonna check outside to see whatever Calvin saw. Anybody coming with me? - I'll go. - Oh gee, that's a shock. I'll guard the girls. - Oo wow, I feel safer already. - Look, we're gonna go track down whoever's running around outside. In the meantime keep an eye on Allie. And if she gets any worse, come and get us. I mean it. And whatever you do, don't leave her alone. Okay? - I'm fine Kristof, I just blinked out for a second or two. I had a long flight. Could be jet lag or something. - Just stay put, okay? Come on. - (sighs) Jesus Christ. This thing's got the believability factor of a bad Baywatch Nights episode. (ominous music) - Dude, I think they saw me. I couldn't help it. - You're fucking this whole thing up, Jeff. - How do you know they saw you? - I don't. But I ran right across one of those old prison windows. - Jeff, you fucking loser. If they see you they're gonna call the cops, okay? By the time we get back to the truck they're gonna have every patrol car in the county looking for trespassers. Is it sinking in? Are you taking fucking notes? - What do we do now, split? - Well we don't know if they saw us. - Can we not take that chance? - Cat, baby, I don't give a shit if you sprout wings and fly back to your god damn girls dorm, honestly. Thanks for being here. - Look Bill, I'm all for sticking this out, but I don't wanna spend another night in jail either. - Well one of us has gotta go back and get the truck. The others stay here and we scare the shit outta these guys. - Who goes? - You go back and get the truck. And drive it up to the main turn off. If we're not back in an hour, you take the truck, you drive it up here and you pick us up. You see the cops, you split. - And you're trusting me to do all this? - What I'm trusting you to do is not fuck up on me again or I'll beat you to death. Understood? Great. You, come with me. - Man your father's got great taste. I dig the decor around here. - [Kristof] I'm glad you think so. In the meantime we have a problem. - Yeah, such as? - [Kristof] Wait, I wanna make sure no one can hear us. - [Calvin] Right. - Look, that thing with Allie, I didn't make her do that chanting thing. - Aw hell, is that it? Look, Kristof, she's got a major league crush on you. She's trying to prove her worth to you so to speak, by playing along with your joke. - Yeah, well so does Michele, but you don't see her sitting there in a trance, do you? I mean they all know my type, anyway. - Well Michele wouldn't. - Are you sure? - Pretty sure kimosabe. What do you wanna hear? She's possessed by the devil? She's fine now anyway. - We don't know that. For all we know she might have swallowed her tongue. - What do you think it is? - I don't know, I think we made something bad happen. - You mean with the seance? - I don't know, I think we triggered something in her brain, epilepsy or some sort of mental meltdown. I don't know. - Hey, it's your joke. You know what I mean? Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. - Yeah well look who got all dolled up for the coffin. - And look at me. I'm not worried. Look, if Allie is messed up, I'd start pointing my finger at Michele's coke or the guys at Club B back in the city. All I did was pop out of a coffin. - Yeah well I'm still serious about this place having bad karma. I mean really bad. - Kristof your dad made up that bullshit contest to sell papers. Hell, if he owned Disneyland he'd have a bounty out for the head of Mickey Mouse. That's the way he thinks. He'll probably turn this old prison into a bed and breakfast for Christ's sake. - Well I still wanna prove him wrong. - My parents almost disowned me because of this paranormal society bullshit. Your father's always gonna find something about you to bitch about. So why worry? He'll still leave you the money. That's one of the perks of being an only child. - Well I still wanna show him. I wanna prove to him that my life's work has been worth something. I mean we've been doing research all along and all we ever get is grief. Doesn't that bother you? - I started this club to get laid. - Maybe we need to start thinking about making a new club. - Oh Jesus, Kristof. Don't be so sensitive, okay? Look, I know this is serious for you. It's just, you're the only one anymore. The rest of the guys are leading their own lives. You can't make them like the paranormal stuff if they've found something better. What now? - I'm calling the limo, that's what. - And? - And you guys are going back to the city, period. - And you're staying here, I take it? - I'm gonna find proof. - It's bullshit Kristof. Your dad made it up to sell papers. - Yeah, well then why don't you leave with the rest of 'em? - That's how you feel? - Yeah. I'm gonna call the limo. And you can stay with Allie. I don't know what she's going through but she's gonna either gonna snap out of it or one of us is gonna have to stay with her until she gets to the hospital. Why don't you go get her? Will you do that much for me please? - Well, what do I get in return? - A clear conscience. - You know you're worse than a god damn girl, Kristof, you know that? (tense music) - Man, I can't remember where the fuck we parked. (startling tone) (wheezing) We are free to walk the Earth again. Executioner. - Hey Allie, I know what'll cheer you up, vodka. - Rory, you idiot. - Christ sakes, Michele. It's a joke, you know J-O-K-E. Something that's supposed to make you laugh. - Notice how I'm not laughing. - Look, I'm just trying to cut the tension here, okay? So sue me. This is like having a party in a fucking torture dungeon. Whoops. It is a torture dungeon. - I just think it's really sad that Kristof somehow thought that this would be really funny. - That's Kristof, Mr. Comedy himself. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Nevermind, okay Allie? Great, you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you? You know what, this is really starting to piss me off. First he drags us down here for a funeral, then a seance, and now this. I mean (scoffs) is it any surprise we haven't seen each other in a few years? - Right, right, and now him and Calvin conveniently vanish to go chase something they saw running outside a window? I just can't help feeling like I got a target tattooed on my forehead. - Maybe Kristof and Calvin don't like us. That would explain a lot, actually. - Yeah. This paranormal shit's starting to get old anyhow. I see you're still getting your courage from Bolivia. - Yeah. - How 'bout sharing a little bit of that with your old buddy Rory? - You have money, you could afford it. - And you can afford to share. - You're not my buddy. The only reason that I'm here is 'cause Kristof asked me. - Oh come on. Kristof isn't the second coming of Christ, okay? In fact, I'd go as far to say as he's got a whole truckload of mental damage going on. I'm his best friend, I should know. - You always talk shit about your friends like that behind their back? - Don't we all? - Yeah, well I don't know about Kristof other than he's hot. - Nobody understands Kristof. You know he's some kind of occult fanatic. Ouija boards, tarot cards, that kinda stuff. His dad made his millions in publishing and the rest of his family disowned him. By the way, it's gonna be a long night. - (laughs) Oh goody, now you're gonna try to hit on me? - No, I'm not gonna do anything. (offkey gentle music) See? Come on, let's go somewhere. - We have to watch Allie. - I'll be fine. - You sure? - Come on, we can go find a room. Maybe something with a shower. Anything's gonna be better than this shit hole. - Yeah well don't you think someone'll notice that we're gone? - No, we'll just tell 'em we got lost. We were checking out the joint. Come on, it'll be fun. Let's go. And bring that coke. Alright? - (sighs) Who says romance is dead? See ya Allie. Yell for us if you need us. (laughing) - [Cat] What about those guys calling the cops? - Trust me, if they're gonna call the cops the place'll be covered in police cars by now. Just watch in case anybody comes back. (gasps) Shit. First Jeff and now you. (speaking in foreign language) Are you coming or what? Okay, you just stay there tough girl. When I'm done I'll leave your joke ass out here to get arrested. Okay? (suspenseful music) (gasps) - Hello? Anyone here? - Anyone naked? Well I don't hear any rats crawling away. That's always a good sign. - That's not funny, dickhead, I hate rats. - Ow. - Ow yourself. I'm not kidding. Rats, mice, roaches, little creepy crawly shit makes me wanna scream. - Okay, okay, I understand. Will you calm the hell down? - Hey, how come there's a bed in a funeral home anyway? - What's a prison doing in a funeral home? - [Michele] Good point. - I'm assuming this was the caretaker's pad back when this place was open for business. I don't imagine he brought home too many dates if you get my drift. - Yeah, it's not exactly the boudoir I imagined. - Hey, it's a bed. - I guess. - Well what the hell did you want, Princess, a maid service and a sauna? - You better be nicer to me otherwise that's the only body part that's getting any tongue. - I will keep that in mind. - So how long do you think it'll be before somebody comes looking for us? - You know what, I'm not exactly worried about that at this point. Are you? - Well I'm not much of an exhibitionist. - Well that's a pity. And an oversight. - So how come you're here with me and not Allie? I thought you liked her. - (laughs) Well for starters, you're not speaking in tongues. - Yet. (eerie tones) (gentle music) - I'm so busted at this point. - Oo, busted, I like that. - Mind if I have some more of your stash real quick? - Yeah I mind. - Why? - Because the coke is dry and I'm wet. - Good point. (speaking in foreign language) - Ah, the executioners. Have you come now to kill me again? There are others. Before the night is through, one of us will use these bodies to escape.

I've done coke before. - Yeah well as much as I'd love to be part of this conversation, I would sincerely appreciate a little god damn attention over here. - Oh honey, I was hoping we could do both, like Caligula. Only with cocaine, you know? - Caligula? Isn't that where the guy sticks his fist up-- - Oh not that part. (Michele groans) - Where are you going? - Ugh, bathroom. - [Rory] We were just getting to the good stuff. - Yeah well trust me, it wasn't that good. - Well it takes two to tango. - Then maybe you should be paying more attention to me than my god damn coke.

(ominous tones) Hey guess what gang, this is not the time or the place to be playing games. (door clangs) Hey Rory! Pretty fucking stupid, guys. (eerie singing in foreign language) (ominous tones) Oh gee Rory, I wonder where you could possibly be. Aha! Rory, I know where you are. Knock, knock, mother fucker. (eerie tones) (speaking in foreign language) (groaning) - Ah, the executioners. - Hey, it's me. Yeah I need you to bring a limo back to the Hawthorne Funeral Home. Yeah, it's an emergency. No I'm not gonna call a god damn cab! The storm's fucking up the reception on my phone. How much am I paying you anyway? How about I cut that in half? Listen, I don't give a damn if you went to Denny's for fucking dinner. I want you to bring the limo back here in 20 minutes. Or you're fired. Yeah and then I'm gonna find you the next five jobs you're at and get you fired from those too. I am being reasonable. Look, it's about midnight and we're done. And we wanna go home. Look, I'll have to get back to you. - What do you want, Bill? - Well for openers, you well to do piece of shit, I want your fucking wallet. Then maybe after that I can start breaking as many of your fucking bones as possible. So the wallet, do it. This is it, $100? - [Kristof] That's all the cash I had on me. - Anything else to say before I break your fucking head? - Yeah actually I do. - And what's that? - That was $100. We agreed on $60. - I think I deserve a little overtime. What with the storm and all. I mean anyway what's an extra $40 to a chump like you? - Fine, keep the $40. - Did you like my performance? - Actually I thought you used the word fuck too often. - Dude I was giving you authentic jock dialogue, trust me. I mean you paid for realism. - You know, I'm not sure if I need to pay you anymore at all. If I remember correctly, the deal was that you would jump me with all my guys present. - Well I had Jeff and Cat already to go. And Jeff got drunk so I had to ditch him. Cat's flipping out so I had to go out on my own. I could still set something up, we could still do it. I hate to think you shelled out your money for nothing. - Not tonight, everyone's vanished. I think I scared 'em so bad they went walking back to town. - Man that's sucks. I's looking forward to beating this shit outta you. - Yeah, you just keep dreaming that big dream and maybe one day, when my spine's broken. - So, what do we do now? Call it a night? - Well it took me about an hour to reach the limo driver. And then he was a little vague as to whether or not he was gonna pick us up. I haven't been able to reach anybody else. This phone's a piece of shit and this storm's fucking it up even worse. - Well it'll ruin the surprise but I've got my pickup parked about a mile up the road. You'd have to ride in the back, but at least we'd be able to get the fuck outta here. - A pickup truck? - It beats walking dude. - Alright, I guess that solves one problem. The second one's rounding everybody up. I sent Calvin to get Allie but I haven't seen Michele or Rory in a while. - Michele can sit up front with me. - You still wanna bang Michele. What about the love of your life, Marlene? - Aw man, Marlene's a total slut. Remember that time you, me and her had that little three way? - Yeah. Actually I remember her watching and that's not a slut, that's an amateur. ♪ I'm a stranger to love, a stranger to love ♪ ♪ I'm a stranger to love, I'm a stranger to love ♪ ♪ I'm a stranger to love, stranger to love ♪ - Whew, damn, that was intense. (speaking in foreign language) Right. I had no idea you could do that Michele. That was some wild stuff. (speaking in foreign language) Are you gonna do that crap all night? I mean weren't you just bitching at Allie for doing the same thing? (scoffs) Typical chick. I'm gonna go take a shower. You can stay here and chant. After I'm done you can get cleaned up if you want and we'll find the others. Oh hey Michele, lay off the freaking coke, it's starting to mess up your brain. (suspenseful music) - The executioner. - Michele, did you say something? (unsettling music) - Rory? Michele? - Man, maybe they did walk. - Nah, if I knew Rory at all, and I do, he's off banging Michele somewhere for some free coke. He's a total addict. Fuck, I told 'em to keep an eye on Allie. Oh this is a winner. Nice try dipshit. Fake blood's a nice touch, but the gag's been over for a while now. It's time to split. (speaking in foreign language) For Christ sakes Calvin, this is getting a little old. See, this is what happens when you don't see your friends for a while, they start to suck. Alright, don't move. We're gonna go find everybody and then Bill's gonna take us home in his pickup truck. (startling tone) - Michele, what's the deal? Are you ditching me? Fuck it. I got the coke. Oh Christ. - Any idea where everybody went? Looks like this little shindig's pretty fucked. - It's not fucked. Judging by the state Calvin is in, someone brought along some shit. Booze, drugs, whatever. Then the probably went somewhere and got lit. They haven't come back up here to meet us so they're probably still back down in the prison. - You think someone's trying to pull one over on you, get back at you? - Get back at me? For what? No one knows what's going on. - (scoffs) That makes two of us. Well maybe you planned this one a little too well, huh? You set Calvin up as the dead guy, you pulled a phony seance, bullshit contest. - What do you mean? - The tallon key. I think you said your dad was gonna pay a million bucks for the proof of. Me, Jeff and Cat heard you telling the guys about it while we were standing around outside. - You know my dad really is gonna pay a million dollars for the proof. (Bill laughs) - You're fucking with me, right? - No. (electricity buzzes) - Now what? - Alright, they are I guess pulling a little stunt of their own. Alright guys, make with the lights. Come on. I'm not gonna call the limo and we're not gonna get outta here. I mean it. - Kristof I ain't gonna lie to you, but they're doing a great fucking job of freaking me out. - Bill? (speaking in foreign language) Bill, what are you doing? This isn't the time or the place. - You have called us and so we have come. We are many and the executioners are few. But they will not let us leave in these vessels. - What are you talking about Bill? Snap out of it. - There is no escape for us. The executioners will not let us leave. We are the denizens of this ground. And you are the one who has opened our prison doors. The executioners want you dead. - Who are you? - We are who you asked to come. We are the ones buried on these grounds. - You're the witches? - Yes. (unsettling music) (ghostly growling) - Hey Calvin, let's get the hell outta here. Calvin? (ominous music) Calvin? Calvin? (tense music) (punches thudding) (thudding) (punch thuds) (wailing) - I warned you. (somber music) (singing in foreign language) - [Rory] Kristof, hey man, open up. It's me, Rory. - What the hell's going on Rory? - [Rory] Man I can't tell ya how fucked up this is. We were just trying to scare you. - I don't believe you. - [Rory] It's true. Tell him Michele. - [Michele] Kristof you asshole, it was a joke. A set up. Like the one you did with Calvin. - [Calvin] Yeah, like the whole thing you did with me. - [Rory] Listen Kristof, Allie and Calvin are hurt bad. I mean I think you accidentally stabbed Allie or something. And Calvin's eye is fucked up too. Look, we need you to give us your cell phone so we can call an ambulance. - You're not lying to me? - [Rory] Kristof! Just open the fucking door, okay? If we don't get Allie to a hospital, she might die. - Maybe I should call 911 from in here. - [Michele] Open the door Kristof. The joke is over. - [Kristof] They're in here with me. - [Bill] Who's in there with you? - The three executioners. - [Bill] Let us in Kristof. - No. - [Man] Then you die. (tense music) (thudding) (eerie tones) (ominous tones) (singing in foreign language) - So, that joke you were telling me you were gonna play on your friends, how did that go? (somber music) (pensive music)
