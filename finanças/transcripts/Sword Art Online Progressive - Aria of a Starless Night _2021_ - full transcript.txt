One minute remaining before the beta test ends. Thirty seconds remaining. Ten seconds remaining. Eight... seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... two... One... This concludes the beta test. Service will start officially on November 6th at 1.:00 PM. We'd like to thank our beta testers for their cooperation. Please stand by for the start of official service. SWORD ART ONLINE THE MOVIE -PROGRESSIVE- ARIA OF A STARLESS NIGHT Good morning, Miss Asuna. Good morning, Ms. Sata. Your breakfast is ready. Your father is at the table today as well. Really? Thanks! Morning! Morning, Brother. Morning, Asuna. Morning! It's unusual you're still home, Dad. Well, you're late. Didn't I tell you to be at the table by 6:557 I'm sorry. How's school? It's going well. I got perfect scores on my math and English midterms, and I might be one of the top-ranking students they're announcing today. How could you not rank near the top on your exams? Hardly any kids at your school are serious about studying at this time of year. I got an A-ranking on my cram school exams, too. My teacher says if I keep this up, I'll be fine. So no worries. There you go, letting your guard down. Now, now, it's fine as long as she's doing well. That reminds me. Koichiro... About your overseas business trip— Everything is all ready. Remember, it's part of the executive candidate selection process. So no cutting loose, all right? You don't have to tell me. I'll be on my best behavior at night, too. Don't even think about bringing that NerveGear with you. - Oh, why didn't I think of that? - Asuna, hurry up and eat. - You'll be late. - You really are something else, you know that? Thank you for this meal. I'll be going now. You have a good day, miss. Hey, Asuna! You heading out already? Yes. You're doing great, you know. So don't push yourself too hard, okay? Right. I know. Hey, listen! The score I got today was my personal best! The parts Ms. Yuuki helped us out with came out on the exam! I'll follow you anywhere! Well, I'm glad that I was able to help. I saw your ranking, too. Amazing again! I saw it, too! You've never fallen out of the top ten since we started here! Why are we not surprised, right? Well, someone did get better grades than me. Hey, I hear you're leaving our school system after junior high, right? What, is that true? Our high school's pretty top-notch, too, so, wow! It's what my parents want. I can stay here till junior high, but I have to take the entrance exams to get into high school. Wow... Listen to you! Heading down the path of the super-elite. You're awesome! Good morning! Good morning! - Morning. - Morning. Morning! - Morning! - Morning! Ms. Tozawa was number one again this time, huh? Yeah. Wonder what you'd have to do to get great grades like her? Why don't you ask her? Not happening! Just talking to her makes me nervous! You and Ms. Tozawa are close, aren't you, Ms. Yuuki? - What? - Lucky you! I guess you get along since you're both top students? That's not really what it's like with us. But I bet you two are always discussing really complex topics. Like the outlook for Japan, or global issues and stuff? See you, Ms. Yuuki! Right, see you. I'm ready to end this now. What? I lost again! You're way too focused on defense, Asuna. You need to attack more. But the commands for my special moves are so complicated! I can't believe you can move your fingers that fast, Misumi. Well, I'm constantly training. You mean you play at home, too? And at the arcade, too. Oh... MISUMI TOZAWA That person's number one again. Misumi Tozawa. And she wins again! How many players has she overtaken? Hey, is that a record for consecutive wins? And that player's a girl, no less! Come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on, come on! Ms. Tozawa? Um... You should've seen your face then! I really slipped up. Who knew they were live streaming it outside the shop? Why should you hide it? It's not that uncommon for a girl to be into gaming now, right? Our school's different. It's one thing if you're in the elementary course. You really think so? You're the only opponent I need, Asuna. As weak as I am? Yeah. Oh, that reminds me. Hey, Asuna... NerveGear? Yeah. What about it? They just released a full-scale VRMMORPG for the NerveGear. Sword Art Online. Right. "SAO" for short. Hey, want to try it with me? I'd like to see you over there, too. But I don't have a NerveGear, so... Your father runs RCT, so shouldn't you be able to pester him for one? I don't see that happening till after my entrance exams. Asuna, don't you think you're pushing yourself too hard? You have to take a break sometimes if you want to avoid burnout. I do go on breaks, you know. No, it's still not enough. So let's have one more match. Well, I guess I can do that. Hey, but first... I noticed that your hair seemed to be getting in your way, so I'll tie it back for you. Turn your head. O-Okay. This feels kind of weird. Don't move, okay? If I braided it in the back, it would be even cuter. I'm sure you'd look great. A break, huh? All right, I'm done. Look at me. What, you're taking a picture? It's my masterpiece. I'll send it to you. NOVEMBER 6, 2022 Brother? I'm coming in. Huh? Oh, right. He's off on his business trip today. Hey, is this... Sword Art Online? So he bought it. Then right now, Misumi must be... I'd like to see you over there, too. Brother, I'm going to borrow this for just a little while, okay? Um... Link start! Welcome to Sword Art Online! Please start by entering your name. Name? Wait, she means mine, right? A-SU-NA. Next, we're going to create your avatar. Gender, hairstyle, skin color, build... Please choose whatever you like, and adjust the details. Wh-What is this? What am I supposed to do? Huh? "You may also base your avatar on a photo of yourself." I think I'll go with this one. Whoa! Brother... And now we're going to transport you to the game's starting point, the Town of Beginnings. We hope that you enjoy your adventure at the floating castle, Aincrad, to the fullest. FLOOR 1 TOWN OF BEGINNINGS I'm... inside the game now? Amazing... it's like the real thing! I wonder if Misumi's around somewhere— Welcome, Madam Swordswoman. Is there something I can help you with? What? This is the central plaza in the Town of Beginnings. The shopping district where you'll find weapon and equipment shops is that way. Um... actually... you see... The thing is... Well, I'm looking for a friend! A friend, you say? Yes! Her name is Misumi— And she's the same age as me. She's about this tall— There is no player registered under the name of Misumi. But I know she must be here. I ran the search again, but there is no one by that name. Her last name is Tozawa. That's T-O-Z-A-W-A. - I'm sure she's around here somewhere! - Why is that girl chatting with an NPC? Newbie. I said her name is Tozawa Misu— Hold up! What are you doing here? Ah? Oh, it's because of this? Help! Let me go! It's me, it's me. Wh-Who are you? - It's Misumi. - I don't know anyone named Misumi— I'm Misumi. That voice... Oh, but you're not the one I'm looking for. That would be a girl named Misumi Tozawa! Misumi is spelled with the characters - for "deep" and "clear," and— - Listen, you— Stop yelling out my real name! You should've given me a heads-up if you were coming here. Sorry. It was totally unplanned. Hey, it's sweet. Tastes like the real thing... You really are Misumi, aren't you? I go by Mito here. What, Mito? Why do you look like that? Because this is the type of character that I like. Well, I have to say you're like a whole different person. I would never think you were Misumi! That's Mito, not Misumi! You're way more ballsy than me, Asuna. Using your real name for your player name. And your avatar may as well be the real you. Well, I didn't know what I was doing. Seriously... But I'm glad I got to see you over here, too. Yeah! I'm glad I got to see you, too. All right, want to get going now? Where to? I'm going to clue you in to the best part of this game. You equip yourself, and battle monsters. What? B-Battle them? No worries. There are only weak ones around this town. But I'm no gamer— Unlike in fighting games, you actually move your body in battle. You're a good athlete, Asuna, so you'll get used to it in no time. I'm not sure about that. But before we start... Let's take a walk through the town. Because that's the best part of this game. How many bests can there be? You must be hungry. Let me take you to a great place I know. It's right around the corner from here— Hey, this game was just launched today, right? What about it? No, it's just that you really know a lot about it. Because I've been prepping for it for a long time. Prepping? Oh, I've got to head home now! What about dinner? Thanks for the offer, but I'll have to take a rain check. I see. Too bad. What are you going to do, Mito? I'm staying. Since there are still things I need to do. Thanks. I had a good time today. I'll see you at school tomorrow, okay? Will I see you here again, too? Sure. I'll borrow this from my brother and log in! Huh? What's wrong? Hey, what do you have to do to leave this game? There should be a logout button. Logout... logout... I can't find it. That's ridicu— There isn't one. That's weird. The UI design's the same as before. Are we supposed to report malfunctions, too? Forced teleportation? What on earth is happening? Mito? Hey... up there! Is that the game master? Why doesn't he have a face? What event is this? Attention, players. Welcome to my world. My name is Akihiko Kayaba. As of this moment, I am the only person able to control this world. Akihiko Kayaba? Hey, who is that? He's the guy who developed this game. I'm sure you've already noticed that the logout button is missing from the main menu. But this is not a defect in the game. I repeat... It is not a defect in the game, but a rightful feature of Sword Art Online. You cannot log out of SAO of your own volition. And no one on the outside can shut down or remove the NerveGear. Should this be attempted, the transmitter inside the NerveGear will emit a powerful microwave, destroying your brain and thus ending your life. Unfortunately, as of now, there have been several instances in which players' friends and families have ignored this warning, and attempted to forcibly remove the NerveGear. As a result, 213 players have exited permanently, from both Aincrad and the real world. As you can see, news organizations across the world are reporting on this situation, including the multiple deaths. Thus, you can assume that the danger of a NerveGear being removed has been reduced. I would like you all to rest assured and apply yourselves to clearing the game. But I want you to be sure to keep this in mind. There is no longer any function to revive someone within the game. The instant your HP drops to zero, your avatars will vanish forever. And at the same time... ...your brains will be destroyed by the NerveGear. There is only one condition for your escape. All you have to do is complete this game. You are presently on the lowest floor of Aincrad, Floor 1. If you make your way through the dungeon and defeat the Floor Boss, you may advance to the next level. Defeat the final boss on Floor 100, and you will clear the game. D-Don't just make stuff up! Clear... all 100 floors? That's impossible! Even the beta testers never made it that high, right? Now then, finally, I've provided you all with a gift in your item storage. Please see for yourselves. MIRROR A mirror? Mito! Asuna! Are you all right? Um, yeah. Huh? Are you... Misumi? Hey, I told you, it's Mito over here! B-But... Huh? Who are you? And who are you? You're a guy? You were lying about being 177 Why? Why would he do this in the first place? Akihiko Kayaba... Right now, you must all be wondering, "Why?" Why would Akihiko Kayaba, developer of Sword Art Online and the NerveGear do such a thing? My goal has already been achieved. I created Sword Art Online for one reason... To create this world and enjoy watching it. And now, all is complete. This concludes the tutorial for the official Sword Art Online launch. I have one last warning for you. This may be a game, but it's not something you play. I wish you luck, players. No... No! - S-Screw you! - Let us out! Let us out of here! I can't stay here. I have to meet someone after this! Is this... reality? Let me out! Let me out of here! No! Somebody save us! This wasn't a game? Wh-What? We're leaving town right now! What? If we're going to clear this game any time soon, we've got to get stronger. But it won't be long before the monsters around here will be hunted clean by these players, and it's going to be tough to level up, even just once. Wh-What you're saying is going right over my head! You don't have to understand right now. But we're getting out of here. Step back. Asuna! No! No! Come on, let's go. Asuna? What is this? I don't get it at all! We can't log out of this game? - How is that even possible? - Hey, calm down. I have to take my entrance exams soon. Why is this happening? This is no time to be talking like that— I don't know anything about this game! Asuna. You can say that you want to move on because you're good at these games! But it's different for me! So just leave me alone! Hey, play with me! Let's defeat that boss today! What's wrong? That might be fun for you, because you're good at those games, Misumi. - I mean, you're always the sole survivor! - What? You can just leave us alone now. Whatever you do, don't say things like that. I know that you're scared. But just trust me. I'll teach you everything I know about Sword Art Online. So let's try to clear the game together. And then let's go home together. Okay. You know how great a gamer I am, right? I'll protect you no matter what, all right? ACCEPT REQUEST TO FORM A PARTY? What's this? It's something like proof that we're friends over here. These games are so weird! We're already friends without doing that! This is one of the best parts of the game, okay? Now we're members of the same party. Once again, I look forward to working with you. Right. No! You're still pushing off too timidly. Let's see. Um... Wow! Instead of leaving it to the system's Motion Assist feature, you can use your own athleticism to boost the speed and force of your sword skills. Boost? I did it! That's it! That's called an Outside System Skill. The sooner you master those, the better. This isn't right. Not like this, but... Hey, why did we come out here, so far from town? Wouldn't it be more convenient in town? Like I told you before, MMORPGs are all about fighting over resources. We have to advance through this game with any edge that we can or we're not going to survive. The area near Town of Beginnings IS overrun with hunters, so it's getting harder to pop monsters. There are no more places near town where you can battle while practicing your sword skills. This place is a well-kept secret, but it won't be long before the players in town find it. Once we level up, we need to head to the next town. You sure know everything, huh? Doing this kind of research— Is one of the best parts of the game, right? All right, let's get a little more work in! Yeah! Switch! You're leveling up your sword skills so fast, Asuna. Unlike how you sucked at fighting games! Hey, don't remind me! I guess I'm not half bad at battling when I'm moving my own body. Let's move on. We've got to clear this dungeon today and advance our quest. Empty again? All we're seeing is already-opened treasure chests! This place might've been picked clean by now. What? There isn't even one left? It's first come, first served, so there's nothing we can do. It must be the beta testers who have the jump on us. Beta? Before the official SAO launch, there was a test play period for about two months. That's what they call the players who took part in it. Because if anyone knows where the treasure chests are, it's them. Wow. Actually, I was a beta tester myself. Oh, so that's what you meant when you said "prepping.” Hey, look over there! Hold up. Don't go opening it so carelessly. This dungeon is full of traps. Traps? You mean like booby traps? A poison arrow could come flying, or there might be an explosion, or sometimes the treasure chest itself turns out to be a monster. What? Since it's sitting here untouched, odds are that it's a trap. If you have no locksmith skills, it would be better to keep our hands off. O-Okay! I hear something. I wonder if someone's in battle? Probably. Why are there so many monsters? Over there. They fell into the trap. We've got to help them! There's nothing we can do at this point. But... If the monsters spot us, they'll take us out, too. Let's head back. I'm back! Welcome home. I got all our shopping done! That didn't work out like I planned! And what is this? Isn't it cute? Seriously. Hey, I did buy the potions, too. This equipment shop has a great selection! That doesn't make this any less overkill. Well, I got worried. You're feeling bad about that dungeon? What do you think happened to those players? Did they really die in real life, too? That's what Akihiko Kayaba said. I can't believe it. The way they just vanished was like a video game. How could that lead to them also dying in real life? Right... you're right. I thought that I knew this game well, but maybe I never knew anything. But there's one thing I can say for sure. I won't let you die, no matter what. That party we saw today... they weren't cautious enough, or cool enough. If they'd kept their hands off that sketchy treasure chest, they wouldn't have ended up like that. I'm not like them. No way would I ever put you in danger. You're right. I'm safe as long as I have you, right? Right. I promise you. Okay, let's get our items organized. Since we'll be heading to the next town tomorrow. Okay. Hey, hold up a second! Hey, I can easily customize my hairstyle from the menu— But that wouldn't be any fun! This feels kind of weird. Don't move, okay? Fine, fine. Since we're doing this, let's do your hair just like mine. It's my way of thanking you for that time you did it for me. What? But it only looks good on you, Asuna. Those cute hairstyles aren't for me— Just sit tight, okay? Are you okay? Yeah. Thanks! Watch out for monsters, too, okay? Because high-level Little Nepenthes have been known to show up around here. Nepenthes? But I thought that Nepenthes were pitcher plants. That's right. They're carnivorous plant monsters. Now that we've leveled up, they're not really a threat to us, but we've got to be careful because the terrain is unstable. All right! Also, once in a while you'll see a Nepenthe with a round fruit on its head, but whatever you do, don't attack it. Why not? Because if it's damaged, it emits smoke to summon its comrades. Then a whole horde shows up, and you can't escape them. I'll be careful. Hey... are those the Nepenthes you were talking about? Remember, if the one with the fruit shows up, don't attack it, no matter what. Okay! You got this, Asuna! If we keep this up, it won't be long before we can wipe them out! Is that a Spry Shrewman? There's one heading your way! Asuna! Can you handle this for a second? What's going on? I just saw a monster that almost never shows up on the first floor. It drops rare items, so I want to vanquish it when I have the chance. Fine! Just leave this to me! All right! I snagged the item! Good for you! Asuna! No! Asuna! Asuna! Mito! Asuna. I can get to the top from here. That's my last one! I don't want to die! Mito! Hurry up and come! Just one more. No way. I don't want to see this! No way would I ever put you in danger. Sorry, Asuna. I can't keep... ...my promise to you. MITO HAS LEFT THE PARTY What? Mito? What? What's going on? I'm sorry... I'm sorry! Are you all right? How much HP do you have left? I'll take you back to town. Would this be enough? There's also map data to the nearest town, so you should be able to get back on your own. All right, I'm taking off now. Asuna. Sorry, Asuna. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO LOG OUT? Asuna? We've been looking for you. Mother? Come downstairs. Let's all have dinner together. See? These are all your favorites, aren't they? Asuna, I hear that you aced your tests. Your mother tells me that you even had some perfect scores! That's right! Asuna, I'm impressed by all your hard work. Mother! I know, we'll have to get her a gift for getting into high school! Don't you think you're getting ahead of yourself there? Hey, why not? How about going on a family trip? You're saying that because you want to go, right? Let's take a break from work and spend some quality time with each other for once! I need to take tons of pictures of my beloved sister while I have the chance! NEW MESSAGE MITO HAS LEFT THE PARTY I need to take tons of pictures of my beloved sister while I have the chance! I need to take tons of pictures of my beloved sister while I have the chance! Mito? Goodbye, Asuna. Mito! Mito! I'm still inside the game. I hear that some players finally made it to the dungeon on Floor 1. It's been three weeks now. That's it? How many years is it going to take to clear this game? Clear? What are you smoking? Never gonna happen! 1,800 people have died already! No matter what we do, we're all gonna die! I have one last warning for you. This may be a game, but it's not something you play. This is my reality. I can't choose how I'm going to live anymore. But I can at least choose how I'm going to die. So that I can still be me. SELL THE SELECTED ITEMS? ALL ITEMS HAVE BEEN SOLD Even if I'm killed by a monster, I don't want to lose to this game... to this world. That was way too overkill. That kobold was already on the brink of death after that first Linear. He's the one from that day? You could've finished it off with an easy normal skill instead of a sword skill. He doesn't recognize me. Something wrong with being excessive? Don't forget there's the return trip, too. You should fight in a way that's not too taxing. Return trip? Yeah, it's going to take about an hour just to get out of this dungeon, and even if you rush, the nearest town is a half hour away. You'll make more mistakes if you're exhausted. From what I can tell, you're a solo player, and if you're on your own, even the smallest mistake could be fatal. Well, that's not going to be a problem. Since I'm not going back. Huh? Not going back— to the town, you mean? But you need to replenish your potions, and get your weapons serviced. - And sleep— - I won't need potions if I don't sustain any damage, and I've brought five of the same type of sword. And I'm resting in the nearby safe zone. How many hours have you been at this? Three days. Maybe four. We're done here. If you keep fighting like that, you'll die. We're all going to die anyway. Nearly 2,000 players have died in just a month. But no one's cleared even the first floor. This game just can't be completed. It's only a matter of where and how you'll die... And how soon or how late. Why am I... You really overstepped. It's not like I saved you. Then why didn't you leave me behind? What I wanted to save was the map data you have. If you've been cooped up near the front lines for four days, you must've mapped a lot of the untrodden areas. I just thought it would be a waste for it to vanish along with you. Then why don't you take it? OUTPUT MAP DATA? All right, I'll be on my way now. Hold up, Ms. Fencer. Basically, you're grinding away to clear this game, right? Not to end up dead in a dungeon? If that's the case, don't you think you should show up at the meeting, too? Meeting? FLOOR 1 TOLBANA There's going to be a Floor 1 Boss Raid meeting in Tolbana today. This many players? Even though they could die? I don't know about that. What? I wouldn't say it's everyone, but it's less about the manifestation of self-sacrifice, and more about the fear of falling behind that brought most people here. I'm probably the latter myself. Falling behind? Behind what? The front lines, see. Sure, the thought of dying scares me, but it's just as scary to know that the boss might be defeated without my knowing. Is that like not wanting to drop out of the top ten in your grade, or wanting to maintain your 70th percentile rank... Is it the same kind of motivation? Uh... well, it probably is. Okay, let's get started, people! Thank you for responding to my summons today. My name is Diabel. My job is... in my own mind, I like to think I'm a "Knight." There's no job system in this game! Today, our party discovered the boss room at the top of that tower. We need to defeat the boss, reach the second floor, and tell everyone waiting in Town of Beginnings that it's possible to one day beat this death game. And that's the duty of every one of us here now! Isn't that right, everybody? Okay! Then without further delay, I'd like to get this boss raid meeting started. First, I want you to team up into parties of six. A conventional party has no chance against a floor boss. We'll need to form a raid group using multiple parties. You got left out, too? Everyone else seemed to be friends already, so I just stayed out of it. Hey, want to form a party with me? He just said we can't beat the boss on our own, right? It's just for this fight... temporarily. ACCEPT REQUEST TO FORM A PARTY? ACCEPT REQUEST TO FORM A PARTY? Okay, are you about done forming your parties? - Then— - Hold up a second! My name's Kibaou. There's something I want to say before we take on the boss. Some of you here need to apologize to the 2,000 who have died so far! Kibaou, these people you're referring to... Do you mean the ex-beta testers, perhaps? Darn right I do! On the day that this stupid game started, the beta guys ditched us beginners, and they all disappeared. They took all the good hunting spots and easy quests for themselves, so they were the only ones getting stronger. And since then, they've just ignored the rest of us. There's got to be some of them here! Guys who were beta testers! We should make them get on their knees and apologize, and give up all the items and money they've hoarded! As party members, we can't put our lives in their hands, and they can't put their lives in ours! Can I say something? My name is Agil. Kibaou, let me get this straight. You're saying that because the ex-beta testers didn't take care of them, many beginners died. That they should take responsibility, apologize, and provide compensation. Is that right? Y-Yeah. You received this guide book, too, didn't you? It was provided for free at the item store, after all. Sure, I got it. So what if I did? It was the ex-beta testers who were distributing these. Listen up. Everyone had equal access to this information. And yet many players still died. What can we learn from those failures, and how should we go about trying to defeat the boss? At least, that's what I thought we'd be discussing here. Okay, can we resume the meeting now? As for information on the boss, actually, the latest edition of that guide book was just issued. According to what it says, the boss's name is Illfang the Kobold Lord. Also, he has an entourage known as the Ruin Kobold Sentinels that appear as a group of three at most. The boss is armed with an axe and a buckler. He has four health bars, and when the last one turns red, he switches to a curved sword-type weapon called a Talwar. His attack pattern changes as well. Whoa. Where did they get that info? This concludes the briefing. Lastly, regarding item distribution, money will be automatically divided equally. EXP goes to the party that defeats the monster. And whoever receives an item keeps it. Any objections? Okay, we leave tomorrow, at 10:00 in the morning. All right, dismissed! Mito? Those are pretty tasty, aren't they? Mind if I sit down? Do you really think it's good? Of course. Ever since I came to this town, I've been eating at least one daily. Well, but I do change it up a little, though. Change it up? Try putting some on that bread. Cream? Thank you for the cream. You're welcome. It's the reward for a quest called "The Heifer Strikes Back" one village behind us. If you want to do it, I'll tell you what the trick is. I didn't come to this town to eat good food. Then, why did you? Rather than lock myself inside an inn and slowly rot away, I'd rather stay myself until the very last moment. Even if I'm defeated by a monster, I don't want to lose to this game... to this world. No matter what. I wouldn't want a party member dying on me. So at the very least, don't die tomorrow. That's why I want to discuss how we're going to fight in the boss raid today. Do you have a minute? Where would we discuss that? Some nearby bar, or inn, maybe? I don't want to be seen and have people get the wrong idea! There are other rooms for rent. For example, the place I'm renting is the second floor of an NPC farmhouse. It's got two rooms and all the milk you can drink. The bed's huge, and the view is awesome, and to top it off, it's got a bath— What did you say? A-All the milk you can drink? The one after that. Th-The bed's huge, and the view is awesome? After that! I-It's got a bath? Take me to your place... ...and let me use... your bath? Uh, sure. Unbelievable! To think that such wonderful bathtubs exist in this world! Yeah. Um, have a good one! No lock? Nothing I can do, I guess. REMOVE EQUIPMENT? REMOVE UNDERGARMENTS? I can die anytime now! I have absolutely no regrets! Oh, but that cream-topped rye bun... What wouldn't I give to have it again before I die? Y-You done? What are you doing in the corner there? Oh, uh... What? Uh, nothing. Before our meeting, let's take this and head out. This rapier was a drop item, but I'm not going to use it, so— What are we— We can still make it to one of the forges before it closes. I was able to level it up to plus four. It should be way better than the rapier you've been using. Why would you do that? We're going on a raid tomorrow. We've got to do whatever we can do. That doesn't mean you should have to get me a weapon— It's just that I don't want my party member dying on me. What I really want is to search for rare equipment, but since there's no time for that— Let's talk about the boss raid when we get back. Just keep me company a little while longer. Listen. At today's meeting... You know how they were talking about the beta testers? Uh, yeah. What kind of people are they? What kind? Kibaou was criticizing the beta testers. He said they were selfish and they'd abandoned us other players. But Agil said that some of them were also passing on information to us. Do these games just change who people are? Did you have some kind of run-in with a beta tester? You can tell me about it if you want. Since I'm a solo player, there's no risk that it'll get leaked. We were friends in the real world, and after we came here, too. I see. So a member of your party. She was getting hold of a monster's rare item at the time. Meaning it was more important to her than me. After all the time we'd spent together, why? What kind of monster was it? What do you mean? Like, was it an insect type or animal type? Tell me anything you can about what it looked like. Uh, it was like a small mouse-human. What was her main weapon? A rapier, like yours? No, she fought with a scythe. I see. SAO is no ordinary game. Our lives are at stake. On top of that, in the heat of battle, in extreme life-or-death situations, a person would do anything to survive. But in a situation like this, there's no telling what people are capable of. You can see who a person really is when she's being nonchalant and normal. That's what I think. It doesn't matter if you're a beta tester or not. What kind of person she is... You should know that yourself. I know... who she is? I'm going to clue you in to the best part of this game. Whatever you do, don't say things like that. That's it! This feels kind of weird. It's my masterpiece. I'll send it to you. Just as I thought. You look great! Mito... Thank you. I feel a little calmer now. You do? That girl is something else. She said, "Let's clear this game together," right? Instead of abandoning you, a beginner? That's something that I never could've done. Sorry. The reason you're in this situation in the first place... In other words, what drove you into the corner, in a sense, it's my... What you just started to say... If we both survive the boss raid, let me hear the rest. I'm going to double-check, okay? As the leftover team, our target is the Ruin Kobold Sentinels—the boss's entourage. I know. I'll use a sword skill to knock their pole axes up. The second I do, switch and jump in. Tell me, before you came here, you played, um... ...these MMO games, right? Uh, well, yeah. Was traveling the same as this in other games? You know, like a field trip? Field trip... I like that. Sorry to say that with other titles, it was a far cry from this. I mean, with non-full-dive games, you have to use the keyboard or mouse, or operate a controller. Oh, I see. Then what's the real thing like? The real thing? You know, assuming a fantasy world like this really existed, and that a band of swordsmen or magicians on an adventure there... ...set off to take down a terrifying monster boss. What would they talk about on their way there? Or would they just walk on in silence? That's what I mean. The road to either death or glory, huh? If we're talking about people who live that as their normal life, then it's probably like going to a restaurant to have dinner. They'll talk if they have something to say, and be silent if they don't. I bet these boss raids will end up like that someday, too. That is, if we can make challenging bosses a normal part of our lives. Sorry for laughing. But what you just said is absurd! This world couldn't be farther from normal life. And you're saying we can make it normal? You do have a point there. But listen, it's already been four weeks today. Even if we manage to take down the Floor 1 boss today, there'll still be 99 floors above us. If we keep repeating the process over and over, then the abnormal will become normal, too. You're strong, I see. I could never do that. Live in this world for years on end. Because that thought scares me way more than dying today. Hmm... if we can make it to the upper levels, we'll find even nicer bathtubs, you know. R-Really? That's right! So we've got to go home alive today, okay? Listen up, everyone. I have only one thing to say. Let's win! Let's go! Commence attack! Squad A! Squad C! Switch! Here it comes! Squad B, block! Squad C, keep guarding and prepare to switch. Now! As you fall back, prepare to attack from the side! Squads D, E, and F, keep the sentinels off us! Roger! Switch! Next! More are coming! Switch! Switch! Switch! There's a fifth one! This boy... he's so powerful. Good job! You, too. Looking good! We're almost there! Looks like that information was right. Squad C! Surround the boss! I'm going after the target! That weapon! It's not the same as the beta test! It's no good! Stay back! You'll be hit with a range attack! C-Can't move... Diabel! Hang in there! Please... defeat... Defeat the boss. For everyone... Why? No way. There should've only been three of them! This isn't what we signed up for! - Look out! - Hold up! Going on your own won't help! You'll end up getting killed, too! MITO HAS LEFT THE PARTY H-Hey, thanks. I owe you— That skill... Switch! We're getting in on the action, too! Come on, over here! Wait! Asuna... Asuna, is that you? No way. You're alive? I... I... That day... We are going to clear this game, aren't we? The boss isn't done yet. Let's both survive this. I've seen that range attack by the boss before, during the beta test. But you have to surround the enemy for it to be launched. Asuna! Use this! It drops rare items, so I want to vanquish it when I have the chance. This is from that day. Thanks! Switch! Not yet! Huh? Y-You're... Everyone, listen to me! We have to surround the boss, or there won't be a range attack! For now, everyone fall back! Everyone who's recovered, get back into battle! Let's take it down together. Right! Almost there. Oh, crap— Mito! Asuna! One last Linear! Let's do it together! Roger! One more time! Mito! - Switch! - Switch! We did it! Good work. Let me chime in. You put up a splendid fight. Congratulations! That was a sight to see! - Asuna! - Why? Why... why did you let Diabel die? Let him die? Of course you did! You knew what technique the boss would use! If you'd given us that information up front, Diabel wouldn't have had to die! Come to think of it, he's right. Yeah. How does he know? It wasn't even in the guide book. Don't tell me it was all lies? But it did say that the boss info was from the beta test, right? - All of you— - Hey! You guys! That's right! He must be an ex-beta tester! That's how he knew all about the boss's attack patterns. That woman must be one, too! So they knew all the good quests and hunting grounds, but they've been keeping them from us and duping us! That guide book, too—that information broker, Argo, just sold us a pack of lies! She's an ex-beta tester, too, so no way would she tell us the truth for free! There's gotta be others here, too, right? Those beta testers? Show yourselves! ... I... An ex-beta tester, did you say? I wish you wouldn't lump me together with those newbies. Don't get the wrong idea. That girl there was only following my orders. She's nothing but an amateur. Most of the thousand people who won SAO beta test slots... ...were newbies who didn't even know how to level up. Even you guys are better than them. Wh-What did you say? But I'm not like those guys. During the beta test, I made it to higher levels than anyone else was able to reach. The reason I knew about the boss's sword skills... ...was because I'd fought tons of monsters with those skills on floors far above us. I know lots of other things, too. Your information brokers have nothing on me! W-What's that about? You're—You're way worse than a beta tester! That's cheating! You're a cheater, that's what you are! Right, he's a cheater! A beta tester and a cheater... A beater! Damned beater! Duping us like that! Are the other beta testers doing the same thing? Dirty beater—keeping all the information for himself! A beater... that's a good name. That's right. I'm a beater. From now on, don't confuse me with those lame ex-testers. I'm going to activate the Teleport Gate to Floor 2 for you. To get to the main square from the exit above, you'll have to cross the field some, so if you follow me, be ready to be killed by a mob at first sight. Sorry. The reason you're in this situation in the first place... In other words, what drove you into the corner... In a sense, it's my— Asuna! Mito? Um... I'm going after him. I've found it. How I'm going to live in this world— it's where he goes. So I'm going to move forward. All right, see you later. Goodbye, Asuna. I told you not to come. No, you didn't. "If you're coming, be ready to die"—that's what you said. Did I really? So beautiful. Come to think of it, you called my name during that battle. Sorry for using just your first name. Or did I mess up the pronunciation? Pronunciation? Never mind that. I never told you my name, and you never told me yours! How did you find out? Uh... huh? Wait... Didn't you say you'd formed a party before? Sure I have. You can see another HP gauge below yours, around here, right? Isn't there something written under that? Huh? Moving your face will make the gauge move, too. Keep your face still, and just move your eyes to the left. Ki... ri... to... Kirito? Is that your name? Yeah. Oh, so it was written there all this time! Oh! Uh... um... I'm glad you were able to check that out. The truth is, I came after you because I wanted to thank you. For the cream bun and the bath? No, not that! Well, I guess that's part of it, too. Right... all kinds of things. I want to thank you for so many things. For the first time, I've found something to strive for— Something I want to chase after. Really? What is it? That's a secret. I'm going to give it my all. Do my best to survive, and become stronger. So that I can get to the place I'm striving for. Yeah. You can become stronger. Not just your sword skills. You can find a strength that's even greater and more valuable. That reminds me, there's one more thing that I need to tell you, right? What I started to say last night... No need. I understand now. The path that you've walked till now. And the place you're about to walk towards on your own. So... I'm going, too. Let's go, Asuna. Right, Kirito! So those two are the top players at this point? Now this should be interesting! Tangled, my thoughts are tangled in a jumbled mess as I untie my hair "You're not acting like yourself” I won't smile for a portrait of me drawn by somebody else The definition of what is right will keep on changing But there's one thing I believe in It's the thrill I feel in my heart I just tell myself, "Go, go!" 70 a place where no one can reach me Step on the gas There's no time to think about fate This is me, right here, right now Yeah, there's a future to reach after those days filled with tears Heading for tomorrow The world is a kaleidoscope Bottled-up feelings Let's dance even the signals of loneliness away Nothing's wrong Those empty nights and fearful days All are a part of me Feeling lost and betrayed When my pent-up emotions explode What will I have left? Yeah While I'm shouting, "I'm here” While I'm wishing, "Please love me"” All I can do is keep running down the road that I've chosen I just tell myself, "Go, go!" 70 a place where no one can reach me Overtaking turbulence, I want to see a part of me that I don't even know This is me, right here, right now Yeah, I want to make the future that I envisioned a reality And I won't blame anyone else You were always such a coward but you've pretended that you didn't know "I'm not in pain” While protecting what's dear to you While smiling and saying, "I'm okay" You cried and said, "I want to change” "I'm sorry" has finally become an inaudible echo Transcending time, I am no longer there "Just leave it!" Yeah, I'm so in the present moment that I have no time to reminisce I just tell myself, "Go, go!" 70 a place where no one can reach me Step on the gas, There's no time to think about fate This is me, right here, right now Yeah, there's a future to reach after those days filled with tears Oh, how I still long to see it Oh, heading for tomorrow with you The world is a kaleidoscope SWORD ART ONLINE THE MOVIE -PROGRESSIVE- SCHERZO OF DEEP NIGHT
