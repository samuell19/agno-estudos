Two underage prostitutes was deported from France yesterday. One of them was caught in silence... ...and filed a complaint against his customer. No, this happened in Paris. No wait, it's not like that, Axel. AFP only for now after this... ...but they are also with the girl who complained they failed to interview. Yes, right. Yes, I succeeded. Actually, it's a bit complicated. I'll explain when you get here. If you decide to come, of course. I give you the privilege, Axel. In two days? This is great! You do not need to transfer in B�kre�. Best to fly directly to Cluj. girl in the north, In a place called Bistri'a. OK? You've played enough. The coach said I was great today. If I repeat the same in the race... Victor may have said that, but... Good to you, very good and perfect I told you the difference between, right? Yes, you did. Then? Am I wasting my breath in vain? You saw how he jumped. I have produced you If you hadn't made the perfect jump... ... at best, you would come 9th. Then you started coming 4th, 3rd and 2nd... Isn't it true? So why didn't you ever come, huh? Why aren't you a champion? Yes? About your fingers what did we talk about, Matei? What did we talk to you? I held them together but they kept sliding. Did they keep sliding, Matei? Are you swimming for the first time in your life? How do you say your recordings? Here are the recordings! Matei, you did a lap around the bottom. Then, as soon as the tape comes off, you stopped focusing. You're distracted. And that's your problem. You are not focused. You don't focus. Your mind is elsewhere. You have to focus while swimming. After that, we go to dinner, we have fun, we travel... But in the pool All you have to do is focus. Just focus on your hands. Is it that hard to do? What did I tell you: hands like someone hold it like you're going to slap it. to come first that's all you have to do. - Don't you want to come first? - I want. - So? - That's how I'll buy it. That's how I'll win, you'll see. Are we back to this "work" thing again? - Are we back to that again? - Yes, we're back to that! - With that? - Yes! - Are you kidding me? - No. What then? What do you mean "what then"? Don't you want to come first? - I want it! - Then do as I say. - I can't hold my hands like that! - Yes, you can. You're crossing your fingers without tape, Because you are not focusing. I'm sick of your perfectionism from their bullshit! What did you say, Matei? Did you say "perfectionism"? Yes, that's what I said. I'll swim my way okay? This phrase of perfection where did you hear it? Indeed, "perfectionism", not "perfectionism". Who told you about this? Is it Carmen? Did your father tell you about this? No. So it wasn't him? Well then. Then to the pool You go with Carmen or Paul... ...or this word of perfectionism to you with whoever made it. �Face as you wish. Now you're done with me. OK? Even if you're not first Don't come to me whining. Come on, eat your food. Before you finish your meal! - Sit down and finish your dinner! - Let me go! Let me go! Mate! Mate! Do you think this phrase "perfectionism" From whom could he have heard? - He sure didn't hear from me. - I wonder. Radu, I'm so tired. He's just a spoiled boy. - When are you going? - Like 10. - Will Axel fly directly to Cluj? - Yes. What does Stiphane say about it? A little mud in the vines, He said, "This is not how it is" ...but I don't think it will be a problem. Since the man came from Paris, You better talk to your cousin. Why is that? i to your face to your eyes not to infect of course! The risk of losing the girl you can't afford it. Axel won't settle for the other girl. I know, just with that bastard I don't want to talk that much. good. into Martyrion I doubt it will. If I'm not saying that, do this for yourself. Cut it out! Okay, maybe I'll call him! Just stop doing this! Is this your phone? Shall I call him? If you keep doing this, I swear I'll pull the car over. Drive the car and shut the fuck up. I didn't pull aside and find a thicket. would you like? - Keep riding. - I'm serious. - Come on. - You're being silly. - Am I being silly? - Yes! How a lion in a cage roars, do you know? nice. The girl has no teeth. How so? They screwed up. Obviously customers she didn't want oral sex in this way. Wait, really? - I filmed your face, do you want to see it? - No. Great, a bike. Did you put it there? No, it was just standing there. - Beautifully laid on its side. - Not bad huh? A flag! I was lucky, the city hall they were sitting across from it. She was only 15 years old, some bad neighbors deceived him... grandma is here He talks like an expert. did you see Wait. look at that. I'm leaving, it's really late. Excuse me. No problem, you can enter. No problem, change yourself. I'm done, you can enter. You could come in we're both men after all. - Can I help you? - No, thanks. - Would you like a lower bunk bed? - No, I'm fine with that. - Are you going to Cluj? - Yes. �� for? No, for an interview. So are you a journalist? Yes, I am a journalist. Give that arm if you want, make room for your luggage. No, it's okay. If you say so. while fishing I had a stupid accident. They had to cut. God, I hurt so much. after cutting it started to hurt even more. I went to the doctor and said: "Doctor, my arm is not in good condition." "This arm hurts so much." "I can't live my life like this." "Okay!" said the good doctor... "It's impossible to hurt." "I cut off your arm, How can an arm without it hurt?" I went from hospital to hospital, they did a test, none of them worked. Pain was destroying me. Then one day... ...who found the solution to the problem and offering me a cure... I met a doctor. What kind of treatment? Let me explain. where my severed arm should be They installed a mirror. So every time I look in the mirror I would see my good arm. Then he said: "Extend your arm, open and close your fist." I've done this over and over. So the brain, your arm in the mirror... ...he would believe it was the arm that was cut off. It got a little better. This situation continued for a few days. Then one day I lost all my patience and I refused to punch. am i stupid, when my right arm hurts... ... why would I make a fist with my left arm? Is your arm amputated? They call it the "ghost arm". Then this disgraceful doctor thought another idea came up. With my ghost arm it cost me thirty-one. - Really? - Yes. A few open magazines they brought me. After... After a few days... Believe it or not, AC completely disappeared. I could even ejaculate now. No more! Believe me, I say truth! At first, the doctors called very much. me in every way They took me to a medical conference. Even now from those conferences I am returning from someone. Doctors the whole thing He says it takes place in the brain. Love, feelings and stuff, it's all in the brain chemical reactions that take place. It's hard to say. tp fully it is not counted as one of the sciences. I don't know how much but that's what happened to me. I'm sorry if I gave you a headache. Why did I tell you the whole story, I don't know that either. Don't worry, it's okay. Well, good night then. Good night. Then this crazy guy he took the car to the curb and pressed the gas. The car tilted 45 degrees. 30, 40 per hour, Or maybe we were going 50 km/h. And the car wouldn't roll over! The ground was running fast beneath us. I thought: "This guy is crazy!" But we had no other choice! If we missed the ferry we would get in trouble ourselves. In the middle of a goddamn mess, we were surrounded by animals. We had neither food nor drink. Five minutes before departure we reached the ferry. I've been loving this car ever since! - Me too. - An unbeatable car. How did you get this? I told you. Radu Patru. Number ten man. Our first job together when did we do it? - Two years, two and a half years ago? - Almost three years ago. That's right. Here's a gypsy in his group I came to shoot the movie. We filmed it in Essonne... ...then take him to Southern Romania. we followed. Yes, as far as Craiova. Exactly, Craiova! - What was his name? - Pandelica. - Pandelica? - Pandelica! What a man! It was unbelievable. by telling lies You could never understand what you didn't say. He was the one who conducted the interview. It was unbelievable. Normally, Carmen shows me around. Carmen is Radu's girlfriend. When She couldn't come, she said: "My boyfriend is a fixer." That's how we met. Finally for AFP did you get on the final list? - Yes, I did, I'm in the trial period right now. - Really? - What were you doing before that? - I was a translator. In a lawyer's office. From where to where! You just ask me about it. Until the summer we passed I was working with an ophthalmologist. - For how long? - 3 months.

The girl said she was 18 years old. According to the procedure, to determine the age of the girl They have to do a DNA test for it. - Really, can they do that? - Girls never say the real age. When you hear that the girl is 14-16 years old, he nearly fell to the ground and fainted. - He started to cry. - Poor thing. Working all day, he was an ordinary man. Through Monday to Friday an employee who does not leave his desk. When evening comes, all he can do is was to find a girl to fuck.

Me too with your arm I'm sorry for bothering. OK? What do you mean? Why, what happened? Why should I stop coming with you? Are you still angry with me? Will your grandmother take you then? What's wrong with this boy? Should I go to the exercises with him? he doesn't want anymore. don't talk it to me Are you sure you didn't force it? I think this is... No, I'm not paranoid!

French journalists. - Nice to meet you. - Me too. - Do you speak French? - Yes. Perfect, we can talk directly. - Then you don't need me anymore. - Yes, you can go and wait in the car. Welcome. Miss Craciun said you were coming. That's Romanian His knowledge of French is unbelievable. Most French do not know Romanian, for example. Did you learn at school? Congratulations. Thank you. My desk is there. Shall I sit down? - Yes. - Thank you. You can take the two chairs over there. Thank you. The little one is over there. Ana, give us some water and biscuits. can you bring? - Thank you for accepting us. - You're welcome. - Can I have your pen for money? - Please. Thank you. I'm constantly losing my pens. Probably forgot in the car. Well gentlemen... ... how can I help you? As you know, we are journalists. On human trafficking in Europe We are preparing a news. to Romania, With the girl deported from Paris... ... we came to see you. - But Ras... - Ra?can. Anca Ra?can. Thank you. Well, How would you like us to shoot the movie? What will we do to Anca? do you explain... ... or directly with him Shall we start talking? Unfortunately, neither is possible. Sir? You can't film Anca, however. Why is that? because of what happened in a state of horror. Certainly. After all the tragedies... We will keep this in mind. I'm sorry. But I can't let you film Aca. But Miss Craciun told us... Both he and I... ...from certain places after calling... ...you understand what I'm saying... ... to see you, We agreed to see you. But not more. Can you translate please? He says we will not be able to see him, however. Look, Sister... However, this news file It forms the core. His story, other interviews are different. it will allow us to see it under a single light. I understand. There is nothing I can do. But you must. Don't let his voice be heard... ...you should provide. Trust me: It helps others as well. Mr. Montini. Hundreds of topics the news was written and watched. Do you think this is the news? has it been of any use? It happened. If journalists hadn't spoken out... ...the situation would be even worse today. our aim to inform the public of the facts. We know you're going through a difficult time, We will not harm him. We will only ask a few questions, his face will not be seen. What is it like to see minors? I am well aware that it is subject to procedure. I repeat, But it's not a good time for it. What do you think we're going to do to him? If you are that afraid, come with us too. Can you translate please? I know you won't hurt Anca. But 2 of them come from Paris, seeing 3 guys he doesn't know... ...it's too damaging for him It can be an experience. So only from men Will it be kept away? Not forever. But as of now, her trauma is so deep and fresh. Psychologists have been abused for every year... ...he says it will take 8 years of therapy. - Do you understand? - Yes. I understand very well. But when he was giving his statement to the police... ...didn't she talk to men? - He spoke. - Well, then? For the cops to talk to him but let... ...not allowing journalists, do you think this is fair? - Mr. Patru... - Yes? French please. The public is aware of the situation of these girls. I agree that it should be. So we agreed. But for this, Anca. Do we have the right to use it? Do you have a better recommendation? Anyone with a mind the gravity of the situation... ... before you film it will understand. I don't think so. One of the silence It is not seen that you have missed anything, madame. There is also a saying: "Neither lie on the landing, nor see the land." "In the Dark", Serge. "Neither sleep in the dark, nor see the land." At least without filming shall we see him? Impossible. Not all of us. Just Radu. He didn't come from Paris. - No, Mr. Montini. - Why is that? - I told you. - What is this bullshit, Sister? It's not a coincidence. be cautious. What, after all he's been through Will the French journalist pose a threat to him? Are you surfing? That's a mouthful, madame. For the truth to come out this is fear. Why is the church always so Does it have to be solid? You want his well-being. So are we. - Do you think so? - No, Sister, that's the truth. Silence is acceptance of the situation. Then this speech is on our doorstep. Continue with the two children waiting. Radu, I don't understand this last sentence. waiting for you at the door I was inviting you to talk to the two children. But in relation to Anca? Ask them. Why would we do something like this? They are neither rigid nor tight-lipped. I can't believe this. Hey, cousin, can we talk? Miss Craciun has disappeared and the one who knocked us out... ...with a broken nun he left it alone. He didn't even let us see the girl. Could you please give them a call? I really need your help. Not "later", just now. Then let me know I know what to do. OK, bye. er? He's looking for Miss Craciun. nice. - In the meantime, let's film the children. - Ok. But to begin with, I'd better go alone. Let's hear it. Shall I take the hidden camera? - Serge, what do you say? - It's possible. - Show him how you work. - I've done it before. - With the same model? - Yes. Be careful. Hi! me about something can you help? Certainly. My name is Radu. for EU On NGOs in Transylvania... ... I'm preparing a documentary. - How did you find the priests here? - They're not bad. A few first class there's an uncle there. Really? I've never seen it. Of course you wouldn't. They keep it all to themselves. Priest Efendi's five, six of them You should see how he brought it. - Did you see this? - What did you think? Are you looking for one of them? No, but that Pastor Efendi story quite a lot of fuel. What was it? I mean it was funny. So it was funny huh? I'm fucking slow, are you kidding us? - Wait, I mean... - Do you find us funny? You're here for that Anca bitch!
