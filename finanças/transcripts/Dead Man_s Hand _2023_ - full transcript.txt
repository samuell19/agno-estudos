Are we there yet? No, we got a long way to go. Maybe you should count to a hundred. One, two, three, four. In your head. You kids wanna see some magic? - Me! - Uh, yeah. Me. Now, pick a card, any card. Slip your card somewhere in this pile and I won't look. No peeking. Oh, I won't. Okay, I'm done. All right. Ahem. Now, you gonna say the magic word with me? Yep. Alakazam! Is this your card? How'd you do that? Magic. Excuse me, baby. It's not polite to drink in front of children. Oh, it's just a little flower oil. You want some? - No, ma'am. - Can I-- No! So where are you two headed? California, to meet my husband. Are you two married? Just this morning, pastor and all. Is that your wedding dress? So pretty! Yes, it is. Thank you. Oh, can I see more magic? You know, we're going to Nevada. We get our own saloon, stage and all. Every night, I'm gonna do a magic trick and I'm looking for an assistant. Oh, she wouldn't be caught dead in a saloon. Mom! It's okay, my mother said the same thing. Just goes to show how wrong they can be. Yah! You think that water hole's close? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? I don't know. We've been riding for hours with nothing to eat or drink. Get up. Take your drink here. Take your drink. Goddamn, this guy's weird. Drop the iron, Billy Yank! What the hell? Don't y'all know the war's over? Get out from under there. Just don't shoot! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Anything in the wagon? Some well-to-dos. - Any women? - Three. One for each of us. Step out with your hands high. Careful, there might be more. I only counted three, how about you? Yes, sir, just the three. I'mma kill you. Then take your bride. Woolley and Company. "Floral Moguls"? That's a silver dollar deck. Custom painted. - Is your hand okay? - No. Here. Let me help you with that. I can still move my trigger finger. Come here. Hey, that dress was no throwaway. When was I gonna wear this again? Our anniversary. I expect a new dress and diamonds. Damn high expectations. When she's done tying you up, you throw the bodies on the back. We're taking them with us? Why? I won't leave a man to rot. - We'll drop 'em off in the next town. I got him. No! Yeah, mister, you one crazy sumbitch. Keeps slipping my mind. What are we gonna name that saloon when we get there? Something, uh... something temple? Solomon's Temple. Yeah. Solomon's Temple. Yeah. If I ain't back by nightfall, come find me. Hold on, I didn't do nothing. Dead men strung to your wagon. Hardly nothing. Those men threatened to rape my wife, Sarah and her younger daughter. - Reno saved us. - Reno? Is that your name? Yes, sir. Jean Jacques Renau. - Fetch his iron. - Oh, now there's no need, no need. We're just passing through on our way to Nevada. And I'm just the sheriff. Well, I expect those back. They're from someone I respect a great deal. Don't touch me. Vegas, play nice. Which one of you killed this man? He did. They shot the driver first. Reno saved us. Nicole! She's right. They attacked first and he defended us. Get on outta here! Go on, get! Bishop's gonna kill him. I promise you that. Sheriff, we meant no harm. See, we were just defending our rights. We'll take our iron and get. There's no need to prolong this. Mayor's gonna want to talk to you. Then we got a schedule to keep. We're going to Nevada. We're gonna talk to a man about purchasing some land for a saloon. You can catch the next wagon west in the morning. - All right. Vegas. - In the morning. Go ahead and get us a room. Okay. But first, I need more flower oil. Flower oil. All right. Well, come on, then. Let's go meet the mayor. Mayor's busy. You just, uh, hang tight. You guys spend money in here, so Alexander can buy some firewood to warm this place up. - Howdy. - Hi. What can I do for you? Bottle of whiskey and your finest room and bath. Yes, ma'am. We have the presidential suite. Jefferson Davis stayed there once himself. You let a rat stay in the presidential suite? Girl, take a good look around. That kind of talk could get you strung up. I hear the stable has rooms. You can try down there. You got clean sheets? Once a week. Fine. Care to have dinner with me tonight? Sorry, just married. Offer still stands. Even if I was single... the answer would still be no. The room's up the stairs at the end of the hall. Thank you kindly. You want some company? You got soap? Lavender. Come on, baby. Hello, Marshal. What can I do you for? Where's Sheriff Ryder? He, uh, moved west. Left the job to me. How about Mayor Thomas? Voted outta office last month. Bishop's mayor now. Where's he at? Anything I should know about? You should know to stay out of the way. And I said, where's he at? He's getting a shave. You oughta button your goddamned shirt up. Second chair. You're next. Oops. Hello, Roy. I missed you by a day in Galveston. I didn't realize we had a meeting. Should have dropped a note at the hotel. I always enjoy your company. Three young men are dead there, strung up in a willow tree. - It's a tough town. - Yeah, well, the word is that you was buying gold claims and them boys weren't selling. Well, I was in Galveston, but I didn't kill no one. Well, Judge Milbend, he signed a bench warrant for your arrest. There you go. Judge Milbend is bought and paid for by Keller Mining. They'll do anything to steal a claim. That includes killing. Get your facts straight, friend. We've known Judge Milbend for 30 years and he's a fair man. Okay, then. Let's go have a talk with him. Sort this deal out. Let's go, come on. Not today. Something's come up. Bishop, I ain't asking. I said not today, all right? Thank you, sir. Bishop. I came along 'cause we're old friends, and I didn't wanna make a show of this. But if I don't return, my men are gonna come into this town and they're gonna tear it apart. Now, look, the judge is probably gonna see it your way. So why don't you and I ride outta here without anyone dying today? Roy. I've just been given news that my brother was murdered. I'm gonna need a couple days to sort that out and we'll go in together. You have my word. Hell, I've known old Ed since we were kids. I'm sorry for your loss. You can see Alexander, he'll provide you with a room, bottle and a bath on the house. That's very nice of you, but not necessary. Bishop. I'm gonna give you one day in honor of your brother. Don't play games with me. What happened? His crew hit a wagon this morning, looking for a quick score. This kid killed him. They hauled the bodies into town. Said it was the right thing to do. He's waiting in the saloon for you. While I see to my brother... you have Johnny find out where the marshal's men are camped. Sir. Two ounces every morning and you should be fixed right up. Thank you, Carrie. I'll see you at church. Hello. I need some flower oil. For my wife. Flower oil, huh? It's pretty hard to come by around these parts. - She has a condition. - May I see it? I know it. You're in luck, I got some last week. So you killed those boys? Those men attacked us, just like we said. I fear that may not matter. Thank you. How much is it? It's on the house. I'm willing to pay. Well... It's a pleasure to help. Well, thank you. Hey, uh. They all know the war's over, right? I wouldn't be so sure. Thanks again. You take care of yourself. Yah, yah! Yah! Get out of town. Excuse me? They're gonna string you up for killing the man's brother. Who? The man you killed was the last living family of Mayor Clarence T. Bishop. War took the rest of his kin, including wife and kids. Oh. I have a horse in the stable. Get your wife, take her and get. Hey! Why are you helping me? A lot of people saying I'm free, but I don't feel it. So maybe you'll send some help and make it right. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He leadeth me beside the still water. He restoreth my soul. Lord God... remember me... and strengthen me this once... to gain what I desire. - Amen. - Amen. - Your hair is so beautiful. - Thank you. Stand up, time to scrub. Your oil. You wanna join? I would love to, trust me, but we gotta get the hell outta here. What trouble you get us into now? One of those bandits I killed earlier? It was the mayor's brother. You all killed Ed? In defense of the ladies. What's the mayor's brother doing holding up a coach? Bishop's not really the mayor. Rumor is, he killed the mayor and the sheriff. Reno, how you find trouble everywhere we go, I do not know. Yankee! Uh, I'm just taking a bath. Mayor's downstairs and he'd like to... parlay over a shuffle. Hello. Vegas, I'll be right back. We're fucked. - Everybody's in? - Mm-hmm. You gotta beat two pairs. Eights. Kings. Second one in a row. Yank's here. Evening, gentlemen. What's your name? Jean Jacques Renau. - My friends call me Reno. - Well, Jean, I'm Col. Clarence T. Bishop, Forrest Cavalry, First division. I've heard stories about the Forrest Cavalry. Them boys a tough bunch. Fuck the Union! Fuck the Union! Come on! Fuck the union! Sit. Well, what's the deal? Jackpots. What about the townsfolk? They just sit by and let this happen? Most of them were killed or ran off. How many men does Bishop have? Not sure. Maybe 50? That's the card, read 'em and weep. Whose rat-chewed deck? Let's not take all night. You like that? How about... we use a fresh deck? New game. Five card draw. We play for keeps. For keeps? I'm not familiar with that wager. This morning you killed my younger brother, Edward. I think you're gonna need one of these. You win, you walk outta here alive. Lose? It's your judgment day. For keeps. You got no choice but to play. Your draw. I call. You ain't even gonna look? No, sir. I call. All right. Pair of 10s, suicide, King High. Whoa! Show 'em. Come on, Goliath, get them gallows ready! We gonna have a hanging tonight! Hey! Shut up! Flip the fucking cards! Aces and eights. I win. I got him! I got him! Hold your fire! Now stand up, real slow! Holster them guns, boy! Holster 'em! Get on out. Let's go! Nobody move! Reno, get your ass up here. Do you always have to win? He was gonna kill me if I didn't. Besides, I didn't even look at the cards this time. Jasper, get up there now! - I'll go. - Let's go, dumbass! You'll have to be more careful if we're gonna have a kid. Vegas... Are you trying to tell me something? I was gonna wait until we got to Nevada, but... Not sure we're getting outta of this alive. Hell, yes, we are. I promise you. Go get him, baby. Let's go. You lead. Whoo! Can't stay up there forever, kid. It's best you come on down now. We're trapped. Fuck! No, we jump. Go to the stable. We'll send a horse out that direction while we go the other on foot. You know I can't tolerate heights. Okay, then. I'll go first. - I'll catch you. - Okay. Well, Philly's tagging along. - What? Why? - I promised. I won't slow you down. Okay, then. Wait. For good luck. Oh, I love you. Next time... you leave those bodies to rot. Yes, ma'am. Let's go, Vegas. Shh! This ain't easy! Come on, jump! He's outside! Keep looking! He's out here somewhere. Where'd he go? There you go, ride away! Fucking coward! Go, Reno, go! No! That's enough, you've lost! I killed your brother. I'll pay your price, just please let her go. Please. Oh, you will pay. But for this mess? I'm gonna take it out of her ass. No! Go! Get him up! No! No! Stop your wrestling! Give me the rifle. Give me the fucking rifle! Toss your sidearm. Slow. Let's go. Let's go. Get on, get over here. I take the trigger fingers from all my prisoners. So, if by the grace of God you escape, it's less likely you'll shoot me in the back. Bishop! We got his guns! Move your ass! Roy, go back to the saloon. You don't have any business here. This is my business. This man killed my brother. What about the sheriff and the mayor? What'd they do to you? Stood in my way. Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you? - Lock him up. - Let's go. You are gonna hang for this, you hear me? - Move it. - You're gonna fucking hang. What happened to you? Well, if you had come with us, you'd know. - Yeah, thank God I didn't. - Go! See you, Reno. Bishop! I'm coming for you. Bishop! Hell won't hold me, Bishop! Bring this one. We shouldn't get involved. He spared your life. We should return the debt. Do as I ask. Take him into my tent. Why is he here? Your husband would be dead if it wasn't for that man. Please, this involves more than what you can understand. Prepare for the ceremony. It was my horse that Yankee used last night. And you're gonna have to pay for it. You betrayed me. Maybe they were right about you. Hi. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, a little more. Reno! Vegas... I understand why they took their own, but... why the kid? Bishop, I found the Marshal's posse. Round up the others. Hey, Bishop, hold on a second. I got something else for you. Uh, I know where the, uh, I know where the Apache camp is. You really got good news today, don't you? I sure do, sir. Thank you. Follow me. We need to talk. I'll let you go. Promise never to come back and leave me be. It don't have to be like this. Why are you stealing gold claims, Bishop? For my boys. For them. They served valiantly on that battlefield. What'd they get in return? Not a goddamn thing, that's what. How do I send 'em home like that? Some of 'em don't even have boots to walk in. Their families are starving, children sick, and no one gives a damn. No, I promised them boys I would take care of them and that's what I'm doing. No matter the cost. You killed men of the law and there ain't no clemency for that. Hmm. Last chance, Roy. You do what's right in your heart. Okay, then. Where am I? - That's mine. - Can I borrow it? I want it back. It's my best one. How long was I asleep? Two days. - Can I borrow a horse? - You should walk. Okay. Hey! Town is that way. All right. All right. You should have given him a horse. He'd fall off and then we'd lose a horse. He's not healed yet and very ill. Keep an eye on him. Whiskey. Four fingers deep. My wife. - Bring her to me. - She's at the mine. Now! She's at the mine with Bishop. She ain't your wife no more. Heard her upstairs last night with two other men. - Big howl. - Sound like she was having a good time too. Johnny, take it outside. I just got the place cleaned up. Oh! Oh! Reno. Where you been hiding? Paid hell a visit. Beat the devil in aces and eights. I'll arrange a game for you. How you gonna pull the trigger with them sticks for fingers? I guess I'll just have to use these. Bad move. No, you don't. Come on Reno. Let's go. Go get Bishop now! You don't look so good. We gotta get out of here! - I can barely stand. - - Come on, we gotta go! Bunch of butternuts come to die. Back on the gold. Good. Keep 'em working through the night. Our time here is growing short. Reno's back. He killed a few of our boys and sprung the Marshal. Had help from Abraham and Apache. They've skipped town. I've got men looking for them. The Apache camp is here. You find Reno, you bring him to me, dead or alive. - Yes, sir. - And Winters. You make sure the Apache never mess with us again. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. I'm his friend. I his friend. Your signing is terrible. You speak English. Let me help you. I need water. Which way is that? I'll be right back. Reno! I'm back with the water. Here. Oh... that was for you. Hey! It's me. I'm your friend. How do you feel? - Thirsty. - I'll get it. Hey, look at that. We have to help him. Nascha! - Chato! - Gouyen! Gouyen! No, he did not do this. The men who did, they will pay. The heart of Niseya. This is the story of my ancestors. Who are they? The protectors of my people. Mine, moving closer, soon to discover this room and destroy the heart of Niseya. I need my pistols. Now, tell me something. How you gonna shoot straight with them fingers? Magic. Mister. You may need it. Hey, thanks. Gouyen! No. Talk to me like that again, and I'll make sure you stay behind and watch the children with a scar to remember. What'd she say? She's going with us. I can hear you from a mile away. Where y'all headed? To save my wife and unborn child. Bishop's got 50 men securing that mine. What the hell you four gonna do? We're gonna fight. They raided the Apache camp and killed the women and children. Bishop's moving to Mexico. There's not much time. We could use your help. Vegas will be in there. We need the cavalry. You guys slowly back up. I'm gonna cover you. - Hey, I got him! - Hold up! Get Bishop! Reno's back! Hold! Abraham, what are you doing? I want my freedom. Give him to me and we'll talk. - Bishop's coming. - Yup. Get back to town now. I ain't gonna tell you again! Take cover! Get your wife! Goddammit! Winters, we gotta go! Right behind ya! Shit! - You all right? - Yeah. Back on your horse and let's finish this. Come on. Now follow me. Get the men together. We'll make our stand here. This is it. We got two squads in town. No, you had. They ran off when the riots started. Took a slew of my girls too. You really worth all this damned trouble?! Huh? Goddamn it! Bishop! Reno! Bishop! I'm calling you out! Kill him! Come on, sonny boy! Goddamn you! Oh... Cochet, hang her! Reno! Pardonnez-moi. Goddamn it! I got him. That bastard's gonna pay for what he did to my bar. - What are you doing here? You gotta go. - I'm not leaving you. You came back for me. For better or for worse. They... they hurt me. You're, ah... pure as the day we married, that's the way I see it. You're a damned good liar. Reno! I got him! Right here. Alexander, I have gold, man. More than you can spend in five lifetimes. Go ahead, get in there and get Roy! Reno! This just ain't your day. Come on! How's that, huh? Get up! Come on! Come on! Die, fucker! Die! Reno! You're still alive. What are you two made of? It's a shame. You are pretty. Kill him, kid. Reno! - That is that. - Come here! Come here, come here, come here. Help! - Help! - Put her down. Put her down, let me look at her. Put her down. Turn her over, turn her over. This hole, we need to close. Come here. Put pressure on her. Where's the closest doctor? Listen to me. He ran away months ago, I'm sorry. It's okay, Chato's wife. - She can help. I know she can. - Where is she? - Go get the wagon. - The mine. Let's go, okay. Get her up, let's go. Get her up, come on. I got her, I got her! Come on, baby. Okay. Come on, baby! Okay? Come on, girl. Vegas... I love you. Vegas, Vegas. Vegas! No! Baby... no... Sorry, kid. That bank has everything they stole from your people. Only when the last tree is dead, the last river is poisoned, and the last fish is caught will man realize he cannot eat money. Gold isn't everything. Family is. Vegas will come to you. You will know what I see is true. Keep the horse. You earned it.
