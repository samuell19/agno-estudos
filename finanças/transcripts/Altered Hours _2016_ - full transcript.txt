AH, I NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY. NOT ONLY IS THIS MY PLACE OF BUSINESS, BUT A SANCTUARY FOR SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY, AND A LABORATORY FOR THE METAPHYSICAL. WHAT HAPPENS WITHIN THESE WALLS IS TO BE DISCUSSED WITH NO ONE UNDER THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF PHYSICAL AND/OR PSYCHOLOGICAL PUNISHMENT. -YEAH. SURE. GOOD. WOULD ANYONE LIKE SOME TEA?

IT'S INSANE, WILL, BECAUSE IT'S TRUE. THIS PRODUCT, THE Z, AS YOU CALL IT, WAS DESIGNED TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SELF-PRESCRIBED IT TO DO. IT LOOKS LIKE BEING COMATOSE BUT FOR A FEW, FOR THE FEW WHO'S MINDS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE, A MORE ACTIVE STATE EMERGES. I MEAN, ONE THAT DIVERGES THE LINER FORM OF TIME INTO ONE THAT'S LESS MAINSTREAM. LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY. TIME, AS WE KNOW IT, TRAVELS IN A STRAIGHT LINE. THINK OF IT AS A MAP WITH TIMES AND DATES SCATTERED ABOUT. NOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF US FOLLOW THE SAME PATH TOUCHING THE SAME TEMPORAL COORDINATES IN THE SAME ORDER. THE DRUG ESSENTIALLY REROUTES YOUR MIND'S NAVIGATION TO A DIFFERENT CHECKPOINT IN TIME BEFORE REROUTING AND BRINGING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PATH. IN OTHER WORDS... TIME TRAVEL. OKAY, OKAY, SO IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE, AND LET'S SAY TOMORROW SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS-- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE. THESE SITUATIONS MUST BE DEALT WITH EXTREME CAUTION. WILL, IF YOU SEE IT, IT DOES EXIST... AND NO ONE MAN CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE BUT YOU HEARD WHAT JAY SAID. YOU CAN'T CHANGE ANYTHING, SO IF IT'S GONNA HAPPEN, THEN LET'S JUST LET IT HAPPEN.

OH, JAY'S GOT A FUTON-COUCH-BED HYBRID, SO I'M ALL SET. HEY, ANY IDEA WHAT TOMORROW HAS IN STORE FOR ME? I'LL TRY AND FIND OUT, HOW'S THAT? OKAY, PREPARATIONS ARE COMPLETE. GOD WILLING, THIS MACHINE WILL GIVE US AN INDICATION OF THE SPECIFIC PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE BEING ACTIVATED AND DEACTIVATED. THIS IS THE LAST TIME I TAKE THIS STUFF. SAYS THE JUNKIE. OKAY.

THAT'S FINE, BUT I THINK YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE RIDICULOUS AND SLIGHTLY HYPOCRITICAL. HAVE YOU EVER DONE THIS BEFORE? HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE? UH, YEAH. NO, I HAVE NOT. THIS IS THE GOOD STUFF, THOUGH. -THIS IS-- THIS IS PRETTY GOOD. -OKAY. ALL RIGHT, THEN I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ONLY TAKE ONE HALF. -OKAY, OKAY. -WAIT, I'M BEING SERIOUS. -I'M BEING VERY SERIOUS. -LOOK AT MY FACE. -YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT. -JUST THE HALF. -HALF. AND I'M GONNA TAKE TWO. READY? BOTTOMS UP. EXCUSE ME. YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING? SORRY, I, UH, FORGOT. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? YOU WERE DESCRIBING YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HASWELLS. HASWELLS?

LOOK, A LITTLE GIRL GOES MISSING, AND HER BABYSITTER, WHO EXPLICITLY WARNED US OF YOUR PRESENCE, IS FOUND DRUGGED AND UNCONSCIOUS IN THEIR HOME. YOUR ONLY ALIBI IS THAT YOU WERE SLEEPING, WHICH, FRANKLY, IS HARD TO BELIEVE GIVEN YOUR BLOODSHOT EYES. WAIT, I'M YOUR SUSPECT? YOU'RE ON A VERY SHORT LIST.

IF I CALL YOU TOMORROW, IF I END UP AT THE POLICE STATION, YOU GOT TO SEND JOHNNY TO COME BAIL ME OUT. YOU DON'T COME ANYWHERE NEAR ME, OKAY? I JUST WANNA CLEAR THE SLATE. I JUST WANNA START FRESH. SENDING A DRUG DEALER TO A POLICE STATION? THAT'S GONNA GO OVER REAL WELL. PLEASE, PROMISE ME, OKAY? PROMISE ME. EVERYONE AROUND ME CONTINUE TO SUFFER AS LONG AS I'M AROUND UNTIL THEY'RE ALL GONE. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. THANK YOU. IF THERE IS A HEAVEN AND IF THERE IS A HELL AT THE END OF ALL THIS, I KNOW WHERE I AM GOING. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I DON'T THINK YOU DID IT.

HEY, HEY, HEY, YOU USED. WELL, SOMEONE HAS TO TEST THE PRODUCT. AND YOUR BRAIN REROUTES LIKE MINE. -YEAH, THAT'S CORRECT, WILL. -ALL RIGHT, WELL, FOR ME -IT'S SEPTEMBER 3RD. -FASCINATING. AND MICHELLE AND EMILY ARE AT A LAKE BECAUSE THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE MURDERED BY A SOCIOPATH. NO, NO, NO, NO, LISTEN, YOU'RE DETOXING. -OF COURSE. YOUR NEUROLOGICAL PATHWAYS ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

LISTEN, THINGS HAVE CHANGED. I'VE LIVED DIFFERENT EVENTS. THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. -ALL RIGHT, THERE'S CHOICES. -WILL, THERE'S ALWAYS CHOICES, -BUT THE CONSEQUENCES-- -SCREW ALL THE CONSEQUENCES, JAY. DO YOU WANT THAT LITTLE GIRL'S BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS? DO YOU WANT MICHELLE'S BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS? MINE? LEAVE THE LAB. GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY. YOU SAID THAT NO ONE MAN CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE. WELL, WE'RE TWO MEN, OKAY? NOTHING'S WRITTEN. WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME ABOUT DYING IN THE NAME OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY? IT'S EQUITABLE TO LIVING FOREVER. LET ME FETCH MY SWEATSHIRT. NOW WILL, WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE MAY SURPRISE YOU, BUT FOR TIME'S SAKE, PLEASE KNOW THAT YOU CAN TRUST ME. YOU'VE BEEN STALKING ME. YOU'VE BEEN STALKING ME! WELL, AFTER TRIPPING TO OUR INTERACTION IN THE LAB YESTERDAY, I-- I DETERMINED I'D BETTER RESEARCH YOU TO SEE WHAT BUSINESS YOU HAD -BEING IN MY PRESENCE. HAVE YOU EVER KILLED A MAN, JAY? NO. THAT'S NOT IN MY CHARACTER. WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT. HEY, ARE WE DOING THIS OR NOT? OH, LET'S GO! EMILY? NO, NO! I'M HOME. 911, WHAT'S THE NATURE OF YOUR EMERGENCY? I THOUGHT YOU DIED ON ME, WILL. THAT MADE ME VERY NERVOUS. -SHE'S UPSTAIRS IN BED. I EXPECT HER BREATHING WILL STOP SOON. IT'S A FITTING FINAL RESTING PLACE, WOULDN'T YOU AGREE? HERE'S YOUR MOMENT OF TRUTH, WILL. EMILY'S UPSTAIRS. HER LIFE'S SLOWLY SLIPPING AWAY. MICHELLE'S HERE. OR SHOULD I SAY HERE. MICHELLE. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. WILL, WHERE'S THE GIRL? SHE'S UPSTAIRS OD-ING ON Z. OKAY, OKAY, NOW GO! MAKE HASTE, COME ON! COME ON, SWEETHEART, WE HAVE A LONG TRIP TO GO. COME ON. RIGHT FIRST. TO LIVING FOREVER. WILL, WATCH OUT! DOES KILLING AN OLD MAN FACTOR INTO YOUR JUSTICE SYSTEM? HE SHOT FIRST. YOU GOT A RATIONALIZATION FOR EVERYTHING. WELL, GUESS WHAT? I CALLED THE COPS, AND THEY'RE ONTO YOU. YOU CALLED YESTERDAY. YEAH, I DID. THEY FORWARDED THE CALL TO MY DESK, BUT NOBODY WAS THERE. WHAT? YOU'RE A COP? I TOLD YOU I HAVE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM, WILL. NOBODY IS COMING FOR YOU. NOBODY WILL BELIEVE YOU. YOU LOWLIFE PIECE OF SHIT, JUNKIE. GOOD NIGHT, WILL. GOOD TIMING. -YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT. -THANKS. JAY? CAN YOU TAKE CARE OF THIS? CALL THE POLICE, ASK FOR ANTONIA RAYBURN, SHE'LL KNOW THE SITUATION. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO DRIVE? I GOT THIS. I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS DONE. I THOUGHT I HAD DONE MY PART, AND WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE, MAYBE I'LL SAY THAT I DID. YOU KNOW, I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET HIM GO ALONE. OH, MY GOD. WILL, IT'S ME, IT'S YOUR SISTER. I NEED YOU TO WAKE UP NOW. THIS ISN'T A MEMORY. THIS IS ME. LISTEN, THE STORY'S ALREADY BEEN TOLD. REMEMBER? REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENS? NO MORE BIRTHDAYS, NO WEDDINGS, NO TRUE LOVE. NO KIDS, NO MORE LAUGHTER, NO MORE ROCKS, NO MORE SUNSETS. NO MORE DRAWING. BROTHERS, SISTERS, MOTHERS, FATHERS, LOVED ONES BROKEN. EVERYTHING BROKEN. FISH OR CUT BAIT, REMEMBER? TIME TO PICK UP THE PIECES AND WAKE UP, WILL. WAKE THE FUCK UP! I COULDN'T SAVE YOU, GRETCHEN... BUT I CAN SAVE HER. GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE. WHAT HAPPENED? YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL. EMILY? YOU MADE IT JUST IN TIME, WILL. SHE'S GONNA BE FINE. HELLO? WE LITERALLY OWE YOU DOZENS OF APOLOGIES, WILL. SAVE THEM. NO, DAVID LANGUISH WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY. WE MISTOOK HIS PASSION FOR JUSTICE AS DISCIPLINE, RATHER THAN INSANITY. HE PLANTED THOSE PICTURES IN YOUR APARTMENT, AND HE USED THE REST OF THE Z WE CONFISCATED TO INJECT EMILY HASWELL. I WANNA SEE THE BODY. NO, HE'S-- HE'S IN POLICE CUSTODY, WILL. NOT DAVE'S, JAY. WE HAVE NOT YET RECOVERED MR. TUPPLE'S BODY, BUT A SEARCH OF THE LAKE IS BEING PERFORMED AS WE SPEAK, AND IT SHOULDN'T BE LONG BEFORE HE TURNS UP. WE DID, HOWEVER, DISCOVER HIS DRUG LAB. ANY INDISCRETIONS YOU MAY HAVE HAD WITH THE Z IN THE PAST WON'T MAKE IT TO YOUR RECORD, WILL. BUT MR. TUPPLE SINGLEHANDEDLY MANUFACTURED HUNDREDS OF VIALS OF AN ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE. NOT TO MENTION THAT WITNESSES CLAIM THAT JOHNNY LUGATTI WAS KILLED BY A VEHICLE MATCHING THE DESCRIPTION OF MR. TUPPLE'S RED SEDAN. HE SAVED OUR LIVES. EMILY WOULD BE DEAD WITHOUT HIM. WE ALL WOULD. WHICH IS WHY WHEN HIS BODY IS RECOVERED IN THE DREDGE OF THE LAKE, HE'LL BE REMEMBERED A HERO. THIS WILL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE. AND WE'RE ROLLING. OKAY, GOOD MORNING, MICHELLE, CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT LAST NIGHT? I-- I TRIED TO KILL MYSELF. I TOOK ENOUGH PILLS TO KILL A HORSE, AND THEN I WOKE UP HERE. CAN I GO HOME NOW? MICHELLE, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF Z? NO. LOOK IN THE ENVELOPE IN FRONT OF YOU. IT'S A SLEEPING SERUM. I THINK YOU MIGHT QUITE LIKE IT. ALL RIGHT, MICHELLE, CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT Z? ANY SIDE EFFECTS WHEN YOU SLEEP? TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DREAMS. I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT'S REAL. SO, I THINK I'M STARTING TO UNDERSTAND. THESE DREAMS, IT'S LIKE SEEING THE FUTURE, RIGHT? AND I DIDN'T GET IT AT FIRST, BUT IT'S ALMOST LIKE A DREAM. IF YOU DON'T SEE WHEN IT STARTS, YOU'RE JUST THERE IN IT. YOU KNOW, DOING THE THING, LIVING THAT MOMENT. MICHELLE, I'M GOING TO MAKE A REQUEST. THERE'S A LAPTOP IN THE BAG NEXT TO YOU. TAKE IT. RECORD EVERYTHING, ON YOUR OWN, IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOUR DREAMS. I WOULD ALSO ASK THAT YOU REFRAIN FROM INTERFERING WITH ANY FUTURE OCCURRENCES. REMEMBER, IF ALL ELSE FAILS, STAY THE COURSE. STAY AWAKE. SO, UM, WELL, I'VE STARTED TO TRY TO KEEP MYSELF FAIRLY STATIONARY, I'M A HOMEBODY NOW, TRY TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE. UM, FUTURE FLASHES HAVE BECOME A LITTLE EASIER TO DIGEST. ALL THAT BEING SAID, THE MORE AWARE I BECOME OF MY REALITY, THE HARDER IT FEELS TO FUNCTION IN IT. OKAY, UM, IT IS 4:02. SORRY. SO, YOU, I MEAN, JAY, MADE ANOTHER REQUEST. HE ASKED THAT I PUSH Z ON THIS ASSHOLE, JOHNNY, THIS DEALER, I USED TO BUY FROM. AND, WELL, IT'S WORKING. I WENT ON A FEW RUNS WITH HIM. SOME STUFF ISN'T EXACTLY PRETTY. I'M NOT SURE THAT EVERYBODY FEELS THE SIDE EFFECTS THE SAME WAY. AND NOT EVERYBODY SHOULD, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING YOURSELF INTO. WELL, LET'S JUST SAY DREAMS CAN TURN TO NIGHTMARES REAL FAST. SO, UM, WELL, I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE WHAT TO DO. SO, UM, JOHNNY KILLED A GUY, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, KIND OF. IT'S NOT YET, BUT I, I ACTUALLY SAW IT LAST NIGHT ON THE NEWS WHILE I WAS TRIPPING, AND, UM, SO I RODE TODAY WITH JOHNNY. AND, LOOK, I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY, BUT JOHN, HE WAS GONNA BASH THIS GUY'S HEAD IN IF HE DIDN'T PAY FOR THE Z THAT I PROVIDED. AND THIS GUY, YOU KNOW, WILL, HE SEEMED HARMLESS ENOUGH. I MEAN, GENTLE, EVEN. HE'S STABLE, FAR A Z ADDICT, ANYWAY. AND FROM WHAT I KNOW. OH, SHIT, I'VE GOT TO GO TAKE JOHNNY TO THE AIRPORT. I-- I'M GONNA CALL YOU LATER. [SIGHS HEY, UM, OKAY, SO IT IS 4:00 PM, AND I JUST DROPPED JOHNNY OFF AT THE AIRPORT, AND, UM, WELL, HERE'S A WEIRD ONE, OKAY, SO, THAT GUY, WILL, HE JUST CALLED ME, AND, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GONNA CALL YOU. OH, GEEZ, LISTEN, JAY, PICK UP YOUR PHONE. WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT? WHERE DID HE WAKE UP? DO YOU KNOW HOW FUCKING SCARY THAT IS? SO, I KNOW YOU SAID STAY THE COURSE. STAY AWAKE. BUT I JUST TOOK SOME Z TO, YOU KNOW, GET A LITTLE, UM, PERSPECTIVE ON THIS WHOLE PLAN OF YOURS, JAY, AND, SO I HAVE A DREAM, THE PILLS, THE-- YOU KNOW, AND THEN NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I-- I DIDN'T WAKE UP. JUST NOTHING. AM I DEAD? JAY? DO I DIE? I'M NOT SURE WHICH IS SCARIER, NOT KNOWING WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN OR KNOWING TOO MUCH. AGAIN, DREAMS CAN TURN TO NIGHTMARES REAL FAST. HEY, UM, SO, I'M AT THE HOSPITAL WILL IS IN A COMA. I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS THE PLAN OR WHAT. I MEAN, I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT. I THOUGHT I HAD DONE MY PART. MAYBE WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE, I'LL SEE THAT I DID. I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT HIM ALONE, AND FOR THAT I'M SORRY. OH, JESUS, WILL. YOU KNOW, HE NEVER TOLD ME WHY HE USED. WHAT HE SAW TO, LIKE, JUSTIFY HIS CHAOS. I THINK MOST PEOPLE TAKE Z TO, LIKE, ESCAPE, TO FORGET, TO CATCH A BREAK. COME TO THINK-- MAYBE HE TOOK IT CAUSE HE WAS FORCING HIMSELF TO REMEMBER SOMETHING. OR SOMEONE. WILL. WHO ARE YOU, MICHELLE? JAY FOUND ME A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. I WAS A MESS. HE SHOWED ME WHAT THIS STUFF COULD DO. I KNOW, I JUST SAW THAT. I SAW YOU. I SAW JOHNNY SMASH YOUR HEAD IN IN YOUR LIVING ROOM. SO I WAS THERE, AND I STOPPED IT. I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS IT FOR YOU, BUT IT WASN'T, CAUSE I KEPT SEEING YOU DIE AGAIN AND AGAIN, AND AT YOUR APARTMENT, JOHNNY IN THE STREET, DAVID. SO, EVERY TIME WE WERE THERE AND WE STOPPED IT. JAY WAS SAVING ME. YOU WERE SAVING HER. I WAS SAVING YOU. THAT GUY OVER THERE, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD IF I HADN'T HAVE HAD HIM MEET ME HERE. HE'S ABOUT TO GO HOME AND REALIZE HE'S BEEN ROBBED BUT THAT IS BETTER THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT HE'S NOT GONNA DIE TOMORROW SOME OTHER WAY? WE'RE ALL JUST DELAYING THE INEVITABLE, RIGHT, WILL? EMILY HASWELL COULD DIE IN 50 YEARS. SHE COULD DIE TOMORROW. THAT TIME IS WORTH SOMETHING. JAY'S ALIVE? YES. CAN I SEE HIM? LOOK BEHIND YOU. JUST KIDDING. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS. LOOK-- I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. I DO, TOO. I'M PRETTY SURE THAT NONE OF THIS WILL EVER MAKE TOTAL SENSE. AND I DON'T ALWAYS KNOW JAY'S PLAN, BUT TOMORROW, 2:00 AM, SOUTH MAIN STREET, A DRUNK DRIVER HITS AND KILLS TWO PEOPLE. I HAVE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF PURPOSE OR POTENTIAL. I THINK YOU HAVE, TOO. SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY? DO YOU WANNA GO FUCK WITH FATE? WHAT? SEEING TOMORROW, WILL, I ALREADY KNEW WHAT YOU WERE GONNA DO.
