Yeah. Okay, sir. Yes. Yeah. Aarav Anand. Aarav Anand! - Yeah? You can go in now. Yeah! Thank you. - Okay. Sir. Come, Aarav. Hi, sir. Sit. Thank you so much for your time, sir. It's okay. How's your father? - He's fine. So you want a loan? - Yes, sir. Let me see. Yeah, just send Ajay and Neha in. 2.5 million! Isn't that a big amount? Yes. Yes, sir. - Come. She's Neha, Ajay. - Hi! He's Aarav. He wants a loan from our bank. 2.5 million? And what do you want to use this money for? Sir, I want to build a dance crew and take them to the biggest dance competition in the world. And India has never qualified till date. Sorry, did I hear you right? You want to build a dance crew? Sir.. Are you out of your mind? I suggest, Mr. Aarav why don't you ask your family or friends for help? Sir, they've already done enough. Sir, there's absolutely nothing to decide. No guarantor, no fixed-income. Absolutely nothing, sir. Think about it. By the way, why do you want to do this? Because no one else is doing it, sir. What's the guarantee that you'll return this money? Is there any guarantee? Is anyone supporting you? Guarantor. No, sir. Is it a joke, sir? Are you joking with us? Sir, he wants to borrow 2.5 million but doesn't have a guarantor. We don't know whether you'll payback this money or not. And you want this money to open up a dance-academy. Not a dance-academy. I want to train my crew. Dance crews from all over the world participate. But no one ever qualified from our country. Sir. It's the World Cup of dance. The biggest dance battle in the world. And I think we're ready, sir. And your crew will represent India? That's the intention. Is it that easy? Are you sure you can do it? Yes, sir. How can you be so confident? - Because I did it once before. What have you done? Represent India? Meaning? Sir, I've always loved dancing. Popping, Locking, B-boying.. And like every kid, even I had a teacher. Ceaser! I lied to my parents that I want to study MBA and reached Sheffield. Ceaser's hometown. A city of 700,000 people. Students everywhere. But I wanted to meet just one man. My teacher. Ceaser. I just wanted to join his crew. I got admission in MBA all I had to do was find a place to stay. Excuse me. - Hi. Hi. Can you help me? Can you tell me where I can find Salim Qureshi? He's right there in the white 'kurta'. Why did you miss class? - Brother.. I would've missed my interview if I had attended class. If you don't have full attendance what's the point of giving an interview? Excuse me. I am looking for accommodation. Where are you from? - India. So you're serious. You want to be in Ceaser's crew? You must be a terrific dancer then. I'll know that when I meet Ceaser. Do you know where he lives? No. I've just seen a few videos on YouTube. Focus on your studies, Aarav. Don't mingle with these Britishers. They're good to no one. What's wrong with him? We attained freedom from the Britishers, Salim. Why are you still stuck on Dandi March? This is the room. 60 Pounds. Salim, water. - Yes. This is Dipen, he lives in the room next door. Yo man! Hi. - Hi! 60 pounds a month, right? - No. A 60 pounds a week. Nothing less? No. You won't get it for anything less. Salim, if you don't mind you can share my room. At 50 pounds per week, we'll have to pay 25 each. Good for me too. It's perfect for me. - Yeah! Fine. Yes.. - A 100 pound deposit. And one month's rent advance. I don't have all of it but, I'll pay the rest, soon. This won't do. Next time, all together and on time. Thanks, man. - Welcome. Where's your luggage? - Downstairs. Hungry? - Starving. Come on, I know a nice place. Tell me something. You live in one of the rooms and the other is empty. Who stays in the other two rooms? GG stays in the room upstairs. Gagan Gulati. He's from Punjab. The only son of rich parents. GG means fun, all the time. He changes girlfriends every week. But only on Facebook. Because until today no one's ever seen him with a girl in reality. This room belongs to Atul Murli. He's from Kerala. Brilliant student. Always tops the class. Less fun, more work. GG calls him a coward. By the way, he learns karate and also teaches Capoeira in some academy. But he's scared doing that too. Which course are you studying? - Nothing yet. But I want to study MBA. The fee is too high. So I am working in my uncle's restaurant. He deposits my salary in his account. And when there's enough to pay the fee I'll take the admission as well. Not bad. Anyway, get some rest. I'll see you later. - Thank you. Atul, what are you doing? Pass that properly. Atul.. You don't know to play, eh? Why do you place bets? Darn! Bad player. Atul, take it. We've been playing since last night. Please let me take some rest. Please. Atul, please. I've already lost two matches because of you. I don't want to lose to China. Please play. Which team is it? - I can help you beat them. Who is he? Aarav. - Aarav, who? Your new house-mate. - From? India. So you two have met? And they say we can't play football, right? See that, Atul? GG made India win with a little help. Right. - Yes. You did everything. We were just sitting here holding the remote. Oh shut up. Aarav, thank you so much. Thank you so much. If you need anything, ask GG. GG owes you one. GG owes you. Think about it, Aarav. He says that to everyone. Hey, shut up. They are just jealous. Ask for anything. There is one thing. I had just one goal behind going to Sheffield. Finding Ceaser and joining his crew. So without wasting any time, I started my hunt. But finding him wasn't an easy job. He was a difficult man to find. And luckily I found some good friends. They helped me settle in. And GG even helped me out. Didn't I tell you I'll find him in 24 hours? Find who? Ceaser. Yes! Look. GG's the best. This isn't Ceaser. Loosen up, I know. But she can take you to Ceaser. Look, she's the only Indian dancer in his group. Right now she's just a backup dancer. But she wants to get in the main crew. And I know where to find her. There's just one problem. Her brother, Salim. Salim? Asian Community President. That's the bad news. That grouch. And his sister's a bigger grouch. They party at Club Embrace every day. We can meet her there. I have connections there. What say? This is GG's area. GG knows everybody. You all right, baby? Come on. We'll have a few shots. Cool! Come on. What's up? That's Aashira. - Which one? That chick in black. Massive difference between brother and sister. Innit? - Yeah man, innit. One's 20 years behind civilization and the other's 20 years ahead. I am going. Take care. This chick don't like brownies. Only black or white. Yeah? - We'll see. He's gone for good. Hi. Excuse me? What? - I want to meet Ceaser. You want to meet Ceaser. - Yeah, I want to join his crew. Why don't you just get lost, yeah! You want to dance off, mate? Do with me. He's Ceaser's right-hand man. He wants to meet Ceaser. Everybody wants to meet Ceaser. Look, mate. The only thing you want to do is get out of here. Let's go, Aarav. - Trust me. Come on! Excuse me. I would've bashed him. Only if he hadn't stopped me. If I had locked horns with Henry I would've lost my chance to join Ceaser's crew. Why is Ceaser such a big secret? In a small city like Sheffield it should not be difficult to find him. Sheffield means 700,000 people. Where? - Get lost! I don't see them. Besides, this is an underground dance competition. And they dance for the love of it. Not for the money or the glitz. He's such a bore. I've an idea, let's kidnap Salim's sister. GG. What the.. - Darn. What happened? - Don't be scared. Coward. What happened? - AJ. Look, that's AJ. Just like you, he came here to join a dance crew. And what's he doing now? Eating bread on the streets. It's a burger. - Same thing. Listen, take my advice. Forget dancing and join Capoeira with Atul. End of problem. - End of the problem, my foot! He did it, didn't he? Didn't he? That day I was scared on seeing AJ. I immediately found him on Facebook. He was an exceptional dancer. I asked him about Ceaser too. But he didn't help me. Instead he asked me to stay away. I couldn't concentrate at the University. And I was running out of money. 10 Pounds for 4 hours? But that isn't even minimal wage, sir. You want work, I don't need another help. It's only because Dipen asked, I am giving you so much. But... Dipen requested his uncle and got me a job. During the day I would look for Ceaser and clean plates at night in the restaurant. But I still didn't find him. I lied to my parents and came here. So sometimes I couldn't sleep due to guilt. But I didn't give up. I tried everything. Come on. Take a look at the boy. I can't, mom. I'm late for the practice. Dear, even you can find a boy for yourself. Aashira. Move. - Mother's calling. Thank you, ma'am. But I am not interested in marrying any Indian or any Asian. - Why? What did Indians do now? Nothing. They are all lovely. In fact, we had a great Indian guy who lived in our family. Didn't we, Salim? Who one day abandoned my mom and his two children out on the streets. That's enough, Aashira. And do you know what the best part is, ma'am? I'll tell you the best part. He lives in the same city and he hasn't even bothered to call once. Behave, Aashira. This is not your friend's home. In this house, we respect family. Respect? Isn't it just a bit ironic to you, Salim that the man you're talking about left me, you and her for an English woman? Aarav! Aarav. Aarav. Look where I just made a delivery. And he's asked for more. Where? - Ceaser's studio, Aarav. Come on, wake up. We have to go. Come on. Yeah. Ready? Who is it? - Delivery. Chaska. Come in. All the best. Oh my gosh! Can I help you? Hi, I am Aarav. - Ceaser. I am a huge, huge fan, man. I've been following you for the past five years. Everything I know is by watching you dance. I.. I love the way you dance. I've come all the way from India, just to join your crew. Why don't you stick to delivering food, bro? Not funny! You're Indian, right? - Yes. I've never seen a Indian boy dance. You know what a dance off is? Yeah, I do. I'll make you a deal. Beat Henry and you're in. Excuse me? Beat Henry, in a one-on-one and you're in the crew, for sure. Henry! This ain't for you, my friend. You come back when you're at your best. We don't take any less than that. Come on. Time to go. End of story. The end. You understand? Hey Aashira, you speak his language. Come here. There's something I want you to tell him. And tell him in his language so that he gets it good. Tell him, I don't want to see his sorry beaten face around here again. Because he doesn't deserve to be one of us. Don't ever show your face here again. Okay? Because you aren't worthy of being one of us. You brownies can go be waiters. Caterers. Or cabbies. Or go beg at a subway somewhere. Cause you can never be like us. Tell him. You brownies can only be waiters, caterers or cabbies. You can never be good dancers. Just go back to Pakistan, India or Bangladesh or wherever you're from. India, Pakistan, wherever.. "What's this punishment?" "What's this mistake You've made?" "My destiny's upset with me." "Why are my dreams away from me?" "Where are You, God?" "Tell me where You are?" You brownies can go be waiters. Caterers. And cabbies. Cause you don't deserve to be one of us. Just go back to Pakistan, India or Bangladesh. "Why are You quiet now?" "Even my shadow's annoyed with me." "Why was my prayer unanswered?" "I'm going to shout, I won't stay quiet." "I'll endure all the pain You give me." "All the wounds you inflict on me, is for me." "Where are You, God?" "Tell me where You are?" Aarav, there's a fantastic party happening at the club. Want to go? - I don't feel like. What are you doing? - Aarav, I am coming too. Look, even the Capoeira is coming. Guys. Hey what are you doing here? Please, just leave us alone. Look, I'm sorry, yeah? I said leave. Okay, fine. I understand. Maybe you don't believe me. Look I really want you to know that I think you're an amazing dancer. And you shouldn't have lost that day. And I am.. I am really, really sorry. Please, you have to believe me. Okay. I believe you. Can we go now? Actually, there's just one more thing. Yeah. - Can I please just have 5 minutes with you? Just 5 minutes! You two join up, we'll go ahead. What's this.. Aa.. - 5 minutes. I promise. You know, Aarav, the other day Henry managed to beat you because he was fighting a battle and you were just dancing. I mean dance is passion for you, right? But these people have long forgotten that passion. Winning means everything to them. Dance off is like a boxing match. You have to be aggressive. And you can beat them, if you learn to fight. If you learn how to battle. I don't want to defeat anyone, okay? I am done. What is it that you want? Okay. I've got dance off in the warehouse next week. And I thought you could teach me some of your moves. I knew it. I knew it. - What? I want to show them that we can dance too. Aarav. - We? We're one team now, huh? And why me? Huh? Why can't Henry teach you? Because I want to learn from you. - Why? Because you're better than him. And you know that too, right? Otherwise you would've caught a plane back to India the day that you were chucked out of Ceaser's studio. Okay, fine, I'll tell you everything I know then whenever you meet Ceaser next. What? I've been in that crew for 2 years. I know everything about them. I'll show you how to battle and you teach me some of your moves. Deal? I'll see you tomorrow morning at the University. Yes! Thumbs up. Wow! It's really cool. - Yes. Do it. Can you do it again? Please. Is it nice? - It's really good. You should speak more in Hindi. Why? - It suits you. Really? - Yeah. Doesn't anyone else speak in Hindi at home? Yeah, they do. Just not me. What happens when mom fixes you up with a nice Punjabi boy? My mom would never do that. Me and brownies just don't go together. What about food? What about food? - Indian food. Do you like it? - It's all right. Can you make any? - Yup. What can you cook? I can make 'dal'. And I can make.. What's that thing called? 'Saag and Makhi di roti'. What? Nothing. I would love to eat that. 'Saag and Makhi di roti'. It's quite hot though. - I am sure it is. But you can't.. - Excuse me! What? Nothing. Get me a cappuccino. And get it fast. Aashira. What's wrong? Look, can we just go? Excuse me. Your money. Sorry. Who was that man? My dad. And please, I don't want to talk about it. Sorry. My family is just a bit weird. It's okay. All our families are weird. Mine are really weird. My dad he left us when I was one for an English woman. I guess that's why he didn't recognize me. Why didn't you talk to him? But why should I? Why can't he come and talk to us? You know, in fact when I was 12 he used to have this off-licence store in my school. And I'd go there every day and wait for hours. All because I wanted to see the white woman that he left us for. But I could never muster the courage to go in. Anyway, it's not like he's dying to talk to me, is it? He could've tried once in all these years, if he wanted to. Right? Right. Yeah! Your house. Where's your grouchy brother? - Oh, don't worry about him. Are you coming to the dance off tomorrow? Yes. See you. - Yeah! Aarav. - Yeah? Do you want to come and sit down for a bit? Thanks for everything. You're welcome. It's quite cold. I think you should go in. I'll go home too. Okay. - Okay. Aarav. - Yeah? Okay. Aashira, I.. - No, no, it's fine. Don't worry about it. I am just going to go. I'll see you tomorrow, yeah? Darn! Hey! Where are you going? - University. They're giving out admission forms today. Forget the form. - It'll close in 10 minutes. Nothing's going to happen. Forget the form. You're going to the warehouse with me. It's on.. - It's Aashira's dance off. I'll get your form tomorrow. You took so long. Where were you? Wear it quickly. Look at the huge line. You won't get entry without this. Let's go. Why are you looking so happy? Mom called today. Talked to dad as well. Everyone's really happy that I am getting admission. - Okay. You know, I would be the first from Baleshwar to get a foreign degree. And the dance off begins now! Oh my God! I'm going to do it. - Go for it. Oh my God! I can't believe I just did that. I honestly cannot believe it. How was it? - It was perfect. Really? Are you sure? Oh God! I think that we should go and celebrate. And I'll treat you. Yeah? - Yeah! And I thought you just ill-treat us. What? - Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. What did he say? - He's Dipen. Jags-Wags. - Hey! Atul. GG. Should we go? - Yeah. Come on, I know this really cool place. Five. That's a five. Yes, what are you going to teach me next? Hey! You still here. Weren't you humiliated enough to go crawling back into your hole? Where is it? India, right? Hey, you did well today, Aash. Come on, we should wash it down with a few drinks. No, I'm all right, thanks. What are you doing? - I'm going for a drink. Is that right? With these losers? - They're not losers, Henry. You got to be kidding me. - No, I am not kidding you. Come on, we should go.. - Get off me! What are you doing? You going to fight me? She doesn't want to go with you, man. Just lay off, yeah! What did you just say? Come on. - What did you just say? He asked you to lay off her. You piece of filth, you Indian. Looks like you didn't get it the first time. How many times do you want to get beaten before you understand you're a loser? Just because you won the other day doesn't mean you're a better dancer, man. Come on. You challenging me? What were you thinking, man? You two bit cabbies are going to beat Ceaser's group? I'm going to give you 10 seconds to get out of here or meet me in the ring. Aarav, come on. Aarav. Let's just go. Let's go. Just forget him. Come on. Let's just go. Please. - Last time, I blasted your face into the wall. This time I'm going to grind your nose into the dirt. This is going to be fun. Well, any ideas? I've been trying to talk him out of it since morning. What do you think? Did Henry take it seriously? Why won't he take it seriously? He should. He should know.. That Ceaser that dance is no one's property. It's Henry, not Ceasar. - What's the difference? What is in the name? - Aarav. Hey! Aarav, I need to speak to you. Alone. You can speak here. Okay. Well, are you really going to do this? Because I can go and speak to Henry and I can settle all of this. She's right, Aarav. - What right? She's asking us to apologize. Are we going to apologize to him? This is why I call you a coward. Aarav, don't listen to him. I'm not actually speaking to you. Aarav, there's still time. Let's go and apologize. But Aarav's here. Why do you worry? You really don't get it at all, do you? Teaching a few steps is easy but defeating Ceaser's group is not. Who's talking to you? Aarav, you did the right thing. GG will support you. GG will organize everything for you. Are you seriously still talking? What exactly are you going to organize? Huh? Do you even know that it takes seven dancers to do a dance off? Do you know that?- I don't know. I don't know anything about the dance. - Then. But I know Aarav. And Aarav knows everything. We'll hold auditions, do anything. But we won't apologize. - It's not that easy, okay? Even if you get the dancers, you're not going to be able to beat them. All right? Trust me. I'm in that crew, I know them. Oh, really? - Yes. Then what are you doing here? Sympathizing with us? - Wha.. Go back to your team. - Why don't you just shut your.. Do everyone a favor and just shut up. ..shut up.. - Quiet! What do I do? Say sorry? Apologize? Enough! I won't step back now. Aarav, we need seven dancers for the dance off. Six! You really going to do this? Yes. That's more like it. Just watch, we'll hold auditions. I'll gather around every Asian in Sheffield. You can choose. She left. - Let her go. We'll make a crew, with or without anyone. Yes! First Asian Crew. And GG will be the manager. Yes! Dipen, why don't you say something? - Coward. There's no harm in trying. See. Yes, come in. Hi, my name is Zara. I've been dancing ever since I was 5 years old. I love it and it's the only thing I want to do. "It's beating hard." "My heart's getting scared. Yeah, I am Reddy and I am looking for a dance. And I am interested in doing dance. "Hey Ganpat! Bring some liquor." Next. - I just want to show the Britishers that Asian people can actually dance. "I'm a street dancer." "I'm a street dancer." - Okay. Good! "You are a lover, I am a lover." "You agree and I agree too." Come on, get started. He's great, Aarav. Good. Take down his details. "Sing along, oh heart." "Sing with joy.." "Your corset is so body clinging." "When I unbutton it.." "I am terror.." I am going. - Wait. He's so fantastic, look. Look, he's fantastic. - He's such a bore. "The king is here, oh people!" Where did you learn this dance? From where.. Next! - Look, Aarav. Sheffield's very own Michael Jackson. Come on, dance. He was dancing really well. Let's go. Can I seek Salim's permission? Do you even pee with Salim's permission? You were dancing so well outside. Come on, dance. He can dance too. Amit! "Yeah, right" "Here is the sweet maker. Here he is." Aarav. Hey, Aarav. Good morning. - Good morning. Did you bring the admission form? I forgot. I'll get it tomorrow. 100 percent. Deal? - Deal. "Spend time with me, you will have a blast." "You will have all the fun in life.." Let's go home. Hello. Hello. Hello. You must dance. We need two more dancers. Where will we find them? I warned you before. But no one listens to me. There's still time. Let's cancel it. Make an Asian crew? Is it a piece of cake? Finding a dancer isn't that easy. And who would want to lock horns with Ceaser? Aarav, you know.. 6th member. - No! No. No. No. No way, man. Hey, come on.. What are you doing? Concentrate. This is the big Asian Crew, is it? Look at you guys sweating out like pigs. You won't even last a few minutes in there. You know, it's only two weeks to go. Make sure you turn up for the battle. Oh and in case you don't know. It takes seven people for a dance off. I know. But can I only see six? Unless you want this clown to dance. Maybe you need to count that again, Henry. Excuse me. Serves you seven of us. Bye! That's how I made my crew. Sheffield's first Asian crew. My crew. Aashira, Dan, Amit, Amy, Mike, Atul, GG. And behind the camera, Dipen. I had got another opportunity to prove myself to Ceaser. And to show him that I was good enough to join his crew. And I didn't want to lose at any cost. So, we started rehearsing day and night. There was just one problem. This dance off wasn't as important for my crew as it was for me. Winning was everything for me. And I couldn't see anything beyond that. So did I get frustrated? Of course, I did. Where were you? What? Training everyone together wasn't easy. But we didn't have an option. I had to get them ready. One, two, and three, four.. What are you doing? Once more. One, two and three.. It's okay. - It's not okay. Aarav. Uncle, the kitchen's locked up. And I've closed everything in the backyard. Great. Uncle, I need money. Did you get a girlfriend? Not this, uncle. I wanted my salary. Your salary gets deposited in the account. You know that. Actually, next week is the final date to fill-in the University application. And I've to pay the fees as well. So I needed money from the account. What will you do at college? And what will you do after you pass out? Get a job? You're already doing that. Uncle, I want to do an MBA. I came here for studies, right? You won't have to spend a dime. Just give me my salary, I'll pay the fee. Your salary? What salary? Who paid for your ticket to come here? I did. Who's managing all your expenses here? I am. Do you think I'm feeding you for free? I don't owe you a single penny. In fact, if you check the accounts you owe me instead. He talks nonsense. Uncle, I've been working here for 10 months. I've been doing 3 shifts. Had I been working somewhere else I would've made a lot of money by now. Go, find some other job. Sorry, uncle. I'll miss my date. Go, go. Don't waste time. Search work. Please, sorry. - Get lost! What do you want? - Don't you get it? Don't ruin Amit's career, like you ruined yours. If he doesn't attend college his attendance won't be complete. He'll get suspended. He won't find a job. Salim, why don't you just get lost? Yeah! Amit knows what's best for him. If he did, he wouldn't have been here. He's here because he wants to be here.. - No! He's here because he's stupid. He's lost his mind like all of you. Aarav, you know what? Let's talk to Amit once. We should just let him leave if he wants to. Aashira, please. No one tells me how to handle my crew. We have just one week left. And I don't want to lose at any cost. Do you understand that? Do you all understand that? Will you get back to work please? Aarav. - What? There's a problem. - What problem? Solve your problems yourself. Problem. Why hasn't Amit arrived yet? He'll be here. An hour late one day before the dance off. Are you all here on a picnic? Chill, buddy. Let's wait for him. No. Come on. Come on! Aarav. Come on. Why are you getting hyper? We'll practice. All of us will get it, yeah? It's not such a big deal, okay? It's not a big deal? It's not a big deal? This is why I came here, Aashira. This is why I lied to my parents. It might be just a dance off for you, not for me. Everything will be fine, Aarav. Relax. Relax? I can't relax, do you know why? Because I don't have my parent's wealth to back me. I don't have ancestral riches like you. I have to fight my own battles. This dance off means everything to me. What do you mean? I mean.. Am I not contributing into this? What did you contribute? What did you do other than running behind Amy? Aarav. - What? No, Aashira, let it be. He's right. He doesn't need GG. Before you say sorry, I forgive you! Don't worry. We can do this. Understand? Don't worry. - Aarav. Just stick.. Aarav, wait. I wish you all the best. - Thank you. You're not coming? - Why? Because I know what's going to happen! Idiot! "I know, my step for" "I like to return to the class." "Beat boys! Bring it down like this!" You did good, but it's not enough, is it? There's a huge difference between the good and the best. There's just one winner. Unfortunately, everybody else after that is a loser. Sorry, Aarav. We should've practiced more. I told you, I can't do this. Forget it. Hello. What? Loser. I understood what it meant after that phone call. Ceaser was right. I was a loser. He's critical. We'll just have to wait. "What's this punishment?" "What's this mistake You have made?" "My destiny's upset with me." Solve your problems yourself. "Why are my dreams separate from me?" "Where are You, God?" "Tell me where You are?" I'll be the first from Baleshwar to get a foreign degree. Forget the form. - It will shut in 10 minutes. "Neither pain nor happiness will last forever." "Who will fill this rift?" "Why are you quiet now?" "Even my soul's separated from me." "Why was my prayer unanswered?" "Where are You, God?" "Where are.." I was so obsessed with myself that I forgot all about my friends. I forgot Dipen. It was my fault. I should've never gone to Sheffield. "Tell me where You are?" - Here. Thank you. Oh! They have come. They are here. Hi! Welcome home. The doctors advised him two weeks of rest. Rest is fine, but don't think you're off the hook. Let the doctor fix you first then we'll fix you up separately. Come on. Take care of him. Don't leave him alone. Come. You go, I'll come. - You sure? Yeah. I won. Four. Look. - Salim, what are you doing here? How are you, Dipen? - I'm okay. Don't worry, brother, everything will be fine now. If I had any clue, this would've never happened. You don't worry. One month! I'll get you admitted to the University in a month. Money? My responsibility. You're in the wrong company. Had you been with the right people this would have never happened. Get well soon. That's all I wanted to say. Idiot! Don't worry, Dipen. I'll get you admitted. And then, I'll also get you a job. I'll also get you married. And after that, I'll help you beget children too. What's the matter, Aarav? Tell me. Salim's right, you know. None of us bothered. I never did. I am a selfish person. - No, you're not. I am. I only think about myself. I need to set that right now. Look, Aarav, first of all don't take Salim seriously. You know what he's like, yeah? And Aarav, you're not a selfish person, okay? I mean, just the fact that you're feeling like this it means that you care. Yeah? We'll have to do something about Dipen's admission, Aashira. He has to get in this semester. - Yeah! Hey! You okay? Mom's sent food. Where's everyone? Must be in the room. Dipen! GG! Atul! You sure you're okay? - Yeah. Wow! Food. Yup, strict orders from mom nothing should get wasted. I am right here. Where's Dipen? Must be in the room. I'll go check. He isn't. - You checked? Have you lost your mind? Where were you? What happened? You should've told us. I just went for a walk. It's okay, come let's eat. - I am not hungry. Thanks. I was scared. I thought he was again.. This won't do. We'll have to do something about his admission. Okay, look. This might be a bit of a crazy idea. But there's one way. 'The Boyz!' 'National Dance-Off Competition.' '1st price 10,000 Pounds?' '2nd price 5,000 Pounds?' No. No, man. That's not happening. - Listen to me. You don't have to beat them, man! Even if we come second, we'll win 5,000 Pounds. Dipen's fee for a year. What did you say? - Even if we come second? "Say yes." "Say yes." "Say yes." "Say yes." "Say yes." "Say yes." "Say yes." "Say yes." "Let us all get together, get together, right now." "In the balcony and in the park.." Pizza! "Let us all get together, get together, right now." Five, six, seven, eight.. One, two, three, four.. "Yeah!" "Come on, I mean.. Let's hear the beat. Yo!" "Come on, yo!" "Body, rock yours.." Fill it! Hi, mum. - Hello. What are you doing? Hello, ma'am. - How are you, son? Oh my God. What is that? Salim's, right? This is our Freddy. Oh, wow! His name is Freddy. And she wouldn't sleep without him. - Freddy? Yeah, I know, mom. That's you when you were six months old. Look. She still looks the same, doesn't she? I am going to bed. See you, ma'am. - Okay. Are you okay? - Yeah! What happened? Run! Run! Run! We've been running for two hours. Off guys! - What's this? Does GG have to do all the hard work? - No.. You come with me. Where are we going? - I'm taking you out. We deserve a day off. "Every moment with you seems blissful." "My heart sways and dances." "Every time you speak the world fades away." "I can't sleep, I stay awake all night." "Beloved..." "I have fallen in love, save me." "I have fallen in love.." Can you do me a favor? - Yes. I am very thirsty. Can you get me water, please? - Yeah. Please. I'll just wait for you, yeah? - Okay. Darn! I told you clean the shelf and do it properly please. Yes, what do you want? Can I help you? - Yes, just.. Can.. Help the customer, Cathy. What are you doing? Did you hear what I said? Help the customer, darn it. Can't do a thing right. Stupid woman. Good for nothing. Can I help you? What did you break now? Nothing. Nothing. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. You know me. I.. I'll break your teeth. No, no, I promise. I promise. Everything's fine. Thank you so much. He would've killed me. Anyway, what are you looking for, darling? Can I help you with something? - "Swimming deep in darkness." "I came to the surface for air.." You just did. "And I've not gone back, ever since that day." "Since you sneaked into my soul, life changed on the whole." "It makes me want to sway." "I was on the road to nowhere, you showed me the way." "I want to dance and feel free, maybe I should dare." "Should I open these doors and not be too scared?" "Should I let you in my heart would you" "promise me you'll stay?" "Promise me you'll stay." "Promise me you'll stay." "Promise me you'll stay." "Swear on you, girl." "My heart's been keeping secrets." "What's happening to me?" "You dwell in my heart. - Holy Lord!" "Accept these sweet nothings of love." "I am the only one for you." "And you're made for me." "You dwell in my heart." "You're everywhere I look." "Listen to what my heart has to say." "Listen to it, girl." "I can never stop thinking about you." "Just say it once and I'll forsake the world." "I have fallen in love, save me." "I have fallen in love.." "I have fallen in love, save me." "I have fallen in love.." Hi. How much did you collect? - 2,500. Salim. I saw dad today and his wife. He's got a store at Edmund Road. You know what? Everything makes sense to me now. I always thought mom pretends to be happy. But inside she was miserable. But now I know she's actually happy without dad. I.. I just get the whole thing now. Salim. There's nothing for us there. I am actually he isn't here. I know that I've been stupid in the past. But now I'm glad it's just the three of us in this house. We're so much better off without him. He's not a good man. He's really not the man we thought he was. Not at all. Anyway, I just thought I should tell you that. But how did you find him? I didn't. Aarav did. Surprise! Thanks, buddy. Happy birthday. I'll go change. - Go on. Come on, guys, drink time. Wait. Aarav. - We have a date tonight. I've to talk to you urgently. No talking. You're going to party. Oh my! Why are you so happy? It's my birthday. - Your birthday? How's the shirt? - Very nice. GG! GG! GG! GG! I want to make a toast. Thank you. Hey, I meant, I want to propose a toast. To GG! I want to thank all of you. Especially, Aarav. I love you. Thank you, Aashira. I love you. Dipen.. We were alive! Why didn't you tell us you had a problem? We were so hurt. GG, forget it. Let it go. And I want to say that we're going to win this dance off! Yes! - Yes! "We're going to do something fun." "We'll all go crazy." "We won't let you sleep all night." "We'll leave only when the sun's up again." "We're going to unite our hearts affectionately." "If the music volume drops, we'll scream aloud." "We're going to unite our hearts affectionately." "If the music volume drops, we'll scream aloud." "You're feeling sad, baby." "You're feeling sad. "You're feeling sad, girl." "No feeling sad." "Because.." "Tonight's the party going mad." "Tonight's the party going mad." "Tonight's the party going mad." "Tonight's the party going mad." "We're going to do something fun." "We will all go crazy!" Hey cornbread! It's too cold. - Yeah. Look. Oh, I love this song. Come on. Aarav. - Yes. Thank you. I feel like I am free.. I feel I am free now. Honestly. Not bad. Your Hindi has improved. But... I am serious. I know you're serious. You're welcome. This is very cheesy. - No. Aarav. Yes? I.. Aashira. What? I love you. I love you too. Keep at it. Keep at it. Like everyone's dead. Look at these guys. They have passed out. - Oh my God! Amit, where were you? You wanted to talk, right? What happened? - Look at Amy. What's wrong? What's this? Amit Unnithan. He's got a job. - Congratulations! He's got to join tomorrow. Obviously, you aren't going, right? Right? I am really sorry, but this is very important for me. I've been trying to get this job for a very long time. My life depends on it. Okay, so.. You can go after the dance off. I can't. I have to go tomorrow. You must go. Go. But, Aarav.. - It's okay. It's okay, man. I know this job's important for you. You go. Thanks, Aarav, but really.. It's okay, don't explain. Don't explain, man. We'll manage. We'll work something out. You go. Go! Go! - I'll see you soon. Aarav.. Hey, guys, check this out. Our crew works very hard for this championship. And we're confident. We've been winning this for the past three years. There's absolutely no reason why we won't do it again. So there you have them. A very confident statement from Ceaser. The man behind his crew. Three times National Dance-Off winners. On the eve of the championship, starting tomorrow. As for how it actually goes, stay tuned. What're we going to do now? We need your help. And it's that time of the year again, folks when England is once again caught in the grip of dance mania. We're here, at the National Dance-Off championship where the crowds are gathering to watch teams from all over the country, compete. But one thing remains the same. Ceaser's crew is the crew to beat. Hello and welcome to the National Dance-Off competition in Sheffield. And the first act we're going to see tonight is status the remix monkey! "Last week I was walking down the street." "You know 'cause feet upon my feet." "You bet those super frosty lows." "Gotta tell you, man, you never know." "My sympthesizers, it doesn't matter." "It might look banner.." "Project glow, glow, glow.. - Yeah.." "Yeah! Yeah!" "Say, say.." "I go easy on the coke, you know, heavy on the green." "Don't pop the pill, oh fella me the aspirin." "Only thing that she looks at sound at the scene" "And if they teach us, it still be my pain." "I go easy on the coke, you know, heavy on the green." "Don't pop the pill, oh fella me the aspirin." "Only thing that she looks at sound at the scene" Aarav. He is not going to come. Please do something, buddy. Aarav, shall I try? Shall I get someone? I can come. I mean I'll stand at the back. At least we can dance. It's not the time to joke now, GG. "We can play, I'll just do acting." "They always wanna try to put you up in a cage." "Try to put you on a different page." "Come on.. - I think the fact is.." "that's right.. - Into just acting.." "That's why they try to put you up in a cage." "Try to put you on a different page." "We.. we generating.." "How busting, rather waiting." "They keep investigating.." "Just chill when they don't need.. They need.." I don't know anything about what all of you rehearsed. Just do your best, man. Yay! "Go! Go! Go!" This is it, guys. Let's show them what we're made of. Let's show them, that with hard work everything is possible. Let's go kill them. "They run.." "Okay, we do.." "P-Power to the B-Boyz!" "Gonna move down.. - What we brining?" "P-Power to the B-Boyz! - What we bringing?" "Go! Go! Go! - Let's go." "Gotta do it. - Here we go! Here we go!" "Yeah! Go! Go! Go! Let's go!" "We gotta do it! Go! Go! Go!" "Go! Go! Go! It's the moving! Let's go!" "Here we go! Here we go!" "Go! Go! Go! Let's go!" "We gotta do it! Yeah! Go! Go! Go!" "B-Boyz sang, B-Boyz seize.." And now we've got Aarav's group and they'd go for it. Not today, Henry. And now it's time for the grand finale. With Aarav's crew versus Ceaser's crew. My dreams were finally coming true that day. Ceaser and I were on the same stage. I don't remember how long I've been waiting for this moment. And when my dreams were finally coming true I couldn't believe my eyes. There was one difference though. That day I wasn't with Ceaser, I was against him. Come on! Yeah! "Like this." "Do you need it?" "Feel it now. Do you need it?" "Can you look in him?" "Feel it now.." "My thing.." Go, Aarav! All right! What a night it's been tonight! This has been the closest final in years. I'm just going to get the results from the judges now. All right! The judges need two more minutes to decide. So who's cheering for Aarav's group? Make some noise for Ceaser's group. And finally, the judges have decided that the 15,000 pounds for 1st and 2nd place is going to be split between both crews because it's a tie. We rock, buddy! You're good. Very good. But the rules saved you today. There ain't no ties in life. There's only one winner. You said that. Let's take this outside. Let the town decide. No rules. We'll raise the stakes. Winner gets 10,000. That's what the winner was supposed to get in the first place, right? No need to think so hard. I am with you. Tomorrow then, town center? Okay, then. See you. Thank you for today, buddy. You're welcome, brother. Anytime. Okay, dance. Let's dance! Let's dance! I can't lose this, man. I am going. Where? - To meet Ceaser. Why meet him? We won't go ahead with this dance off. I mean look at you guys, you all look so happy. What if we lose tomorrow? You'll lose your fees. We did what we could. I don't know what I was thinking, man. I was just being selfish again. Anyway, I'm going to go settle this. And when I come back, we're going to party. We'll party after we win, Aarav. I know what you're doing. But we won't let you do it. Not after making it this far. Aarav, he's absolutely right. It's time to show these Britishers. And we will. Innit? - Yeah man, innit! Yes, I'm game for it! I don't like to be called coward. It's time to get my name changed. See. Yes, Aarav. I wouldn't have said yes if we had any chance of losing. You can do it, bro. Aarav. We've come this far. This isn't just your dream anymore. We all really want to do this. And now's our time to show them who we are. Come on. I know you're doing this for me. You're scared of losing all the money, right? Today you won for me. Tomorrow you need to win for yourself. And we're all with you. What the.. Innit! - Inn... You from India? Yes. Shouldn't the band on your wrist be orange, white and green? Yeah! It should. Thank you. Thank you. - Yes.. Thank you, sir. Aashira, call everyone. We've to meet now. That old man made me realize. Until now we were fighting them as per their rules. But it was time they realized there's no country like India. And we were about to show them that. Yeah.. - Do it.. "Put 'em up! Put 'em up! Up! Up! Up!" "Put 'em up! Put 'em up! Up! Up! Up!" "Put 'em up! Put 'em up! Up! Up! Up!" "Put 'em up! Put 'em up! Up! Up! Up!" "Dance it." "Dance it." "Let's brickbat, we don't know." "Look-alikes who can dance who names we don't know." "Rode out, all that, greatest thing to go." "On, on your marks, ready-ready, set, let's go." "Yeah, yeah.. You know what time it is, show time." "Get-get up on the floor, 'cause it's your time." "That's-that up to the crew who want you to shine." "Romance.. - Showing the way to stay your lam." "Keep it, stay and shut up." "Dangerous!" "Put 'em up! Put 'em up!" "Put 'em up! Put 'em up!" "Cause, you're ready, yo! Put 'em up! Put 'em up!" "Cause you are ready.. Put 'em up! Put 'em up!" "When we enter the battlefield, the enemy retreats." "There's no one who can defeat us." "Shut up.." "When we enter the battlefield, the enemy retreats." "There's no one who can defeat us." "We can conquer the world with our dance." "We can conquer the world with our dance." "Come shake your body." "Get on the floor.. - We're Punjabi boys." "We're Punjabi boys." "We're Punjabi boys." "We're Punjabi boys." "Let's go. Put 'em up! Put 'em up!" "Put 'em up! Put 'em up!" "Dangerous!" "Put 'em up! Put 'em up!" "Put 'em up! Put 'em up!" "Dangerous!" "Keep up.." "Keep it up.." "There you go.." "Go so now.." "Yeah.." "Let's go." "We're best of friends" "and worst of enemies." "We're generous at heart, such is our unique style." "We're best of friends" "and worst of enemies." "We're generous at heart, such is our unique style." "A Punjabi can rock the entire party alone." "A Punjabi can rock the entire party alone." "Come dance with me." "Get on the floor.. - We're Punjabi boys." "We're Punjabi boys." "We're Punjabi boys." "We're Punjabi boys." "When we enter the battlefield, the enemy retreats." "There's no one that can defeat us." "We can conquer the world with our dance." "We can conquer the world with our dance." "Come shake your body."

"Put 'em up! Put 'em up! Up! Up! Up!" "Put 'em up! Put 'em up!" "Cause you are ready, yo! Cause you are ready, yo!" "Put 'em up! Put 'em up! Come on!" GG always said. 'Dance is no one's property.' And we proved it that day. I never wanted to show that they are better than us. But yes, I did want to prove that we aren't bad either. And I want to show the entire world that we're as good as anyone else. Nice story, young man. But unfortunately, we're not running a news channel. We run a bank. We need all the right documents. Guarantees. Guarantor. And you don't have it. And so we cannot give you any loan. Now, if you don't mind can we get back to our work? Please. By the way, thank you for entertaining us. Thank you, sir. All the best, Aarav. Thank you. Yeah. Sir.. Thank you. "Tonight's the party's going mad." That's your set. I was.. - Yeah.. Darn you! Allow me in. What are you doing? I am sorry.. I had given you water. What.. Sorry. Won't you say something? Fool! What stupid.. Looking there.. Sorry, can we call.. - Give her the line. Cut! - Cut! Cut! - One more. Cut it! Cut it! - Cut it! Cut! - Cut! Cut! - Cut! Can't it be any less? Why slap me?
