But starting today, things will be different. May I present to you an administrator who has promised to carry out her duties with an iron hand. The new principal of Vince Lombardi High, Miss Evelyn Togar. (all applauding) - Thank you. (clears throat) (typewriter clicking) Members of the board, as we stand on the threshold of a new decade, we must face harsh reality. Our educational system has become far too permissive. As that famous scholar once said, "My darling Evelyn, "how I long for the feel of your luscious thighs wrapped." As you all know, I'm here to replace Professor Webb, who is unable to continue his duties as the chief administrator of this school. And now I would like us all to rise and salute professor Webb for his wonderful, gallant effort. - Ludwig van Beethoven, whom you will be interested to learn, wrote his greatest symphony (student yawning) at a time when he was completely deaf. A feat which was practically unheard of at the time. (laughing) (wheezing) I know that most of you are used to listening to a very different kind of music, but I hope that when you hear the immortal strains of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, (student blowing raspberries) you'll realize what a work of genius it really is. (students sighing) I seem to have misplaced the turntable. (record crackling) - Hi, everybody. I'm Riff Randell, and this is rock 'n' roll high school.

(students laughing) If it's discipline that you students need, I am the one who can provide it for you. - [Students] Uh-oh. - Well, now, I'm not interested in punishing anyone, (students scoff) but I think for the good of the whole school, the person responsible for this deviation from the schedule should step forward. - [Riff] Kate, what are you doing? - What is your name? - Kate Rambeau. - And who are you? - I'm Riff Randell, rock 'n' roller. (students laughing) - Obviously you do not know who I am. I am Miss Togar, and I am the new principal of this school. - Whoo! - Oh, shit. - I want you to go to your classes now.

That's the Ramones' best album. Number one with a bullet. - Randell, I want to see both of you in detention center before the next bell, or else. - Oh, Riff, detention center.

Kate Rambeau, age 17, attends Vince Lombardi High, where she majors in nuclear physics. This perky gal-on-the-go's hobbies include splitting protons and checkers.

And now back to you, Mr. E. (audience applauding) (fanfare music) - Thank you, Johnny. There she is, Tom. - I had somebody else in mind. - Oh, Tom, my files indicate she's perfect for you. - I know, I know, but I was kinda hopin' that you'd set me up with Riff Randell. - Riff Randell? How about a cheerleader? Nice set of pompoms. - No. The only girl I ever dream about at night is Riff. But I always keep waking up just before the good part. - Well, how are you set for large amounts of hard cash? (snaps fingers) - I have a major credit card. - Norma, dear? - Yes, Mr. Eaglebauer. - Yes, would you draw up a contract for Tom Roberts and Riff Randell?

(giggling) - That was close. We just got out of trouble. You wanna put us back in? - Are you kidding? "What's that thing in your ear?" She doesn't even know the Beatles broke up. - I know something is going on behind my back. (chuckling) You two are not doing your jobs. Look at me when I'm talking to you. You're supposed to be my eyes, my ears, my nose. (sneezes) - [Hansel] Thank you. - If this school is going to get back on the winning track, we have to start cracking down immediately. And I know just where to begin. Okay, you take a note to Mr. McGree. And I want you to take the same note to Coach Steroid. Tell them to meet me immediately in the science lab. (upbeat music) - The most famous notes in all of the musical literature. Now. (class laughing) Ear-mail. (class groaning) Class, I have to go to Miss Togar's office. I'd like you to look over the chapter on Beethoven's Fifth Symphony while I'm gone. Oh, and, class, as soon as I get back, there's going to be a surprise quiz on this material. (class groaning) - Come on. - Nice work, Rambeau. I knew you could do it. Okay, now come on down. - I'm stuck. - Nonsense, there's nothing to it. - Just go hand over hand, but above all, do not slide. (hands squealing) (all gasp) - Kate, are you all right? - All right, girls, she's okay. You're okay, Rambeau. Get up and walk it off. Come on, come on, girls. Let's move it. - Hey! - You fat creep. - Yes? - Note. - [Steroid] Darling Evelyn, how I long for the feel of your luscious thighs. - Oh, wrong note. - All right, class. (blows whistle) Listen up. - Are you okay? - I'm gonna be gone for a few minutes. While I'm away, I want you to continue with your exercises for the day. - Aww. - Nah, none of that. (gentle piano music) (snapping fingers) Let's have a little enthusiasm. And a (blows whistle). A-one and a-two, and a-jumping up and down. Come on, girls. That's right, peppy! Now keep that up till I get back. - Well, you're probably wondering why I called you here. - Me. - I know, I know. - Me. - I know. I know, I know. - Me. - Go and monitor the halls. Since assuming office this morning, I've noticed a number of peculiar incidents among the members of the student body, all having to do with rock and roll music. - Miss Togar, I have no particular love for rock 'n' roll, but it doesn't seem to me that listening to it actually hurts the students. - Ah-ha-ha, but that's where you're wrong, Mr. McGree. Recently, (mouse squeaking) I have been doing a study of mice subjected to rock 'n' roll music. Here we have a picture of this mouse, a typical member of the genus Rattus rodenti, as he appeared before the start of my investigation: clean, good-natured, content to scamper playfully about his cage. This is a picture of the same mouse. One week after the introduction of rock 'n' roll music. - I never dreamed. - The results were dramatic. He lost all interest in keeping his cage tidy. - How scientific. - He played his electric guitar far into the night, keeping the other test animals awake. - [Steroid] He did? - And he met this female mouse and they have been sharing a cage together out of wedlock. - That's fascinating, Miss Togar. - Yes, it is. - Is she crazy? - She's a principal. - Monitor the hall, monitor the hall. I am sick of monitoring the hall. - Yep. - [Hansel] Let's go monitor the freshman. - [Gretel] Good idea. - Get him. - All right, up against the wall, spread 'em. All right, what the hell do you think you're doing out here? - I was just getting my books. - Listen, you have a hall pass? - Well, no. - [Both] No hall pass? - Hit him, hit him. - Guys, I'm allergic to violence. I break out in blood. - Hit him anyway. - Calm down. Let me see some ID. Come on, I haven't got all day. - I need it for the sock hop tonight. - The sock hop. - Who'd dance with you? All you have is a buck? - I'll have that. - Is this you? - Well, I take a bad picture. - Tell me about it. (both groaning) - Listen, I'm gonna give you a demerit. - What's a demerit? - If you get enough of 'em, you wind up in Miss Togar's office. - [Both] Demerit, demerit. (chuckling) - Well, what for? - [Both] Because you're ugly. - Hit him now. Hit him, hit him. - Wait. I have a great idea. Let's go monitor the girls' gym. - All right. (gentle piano music) - What are you doing, Riff? - Gym class called on account of boredom. Got some of my homework instead. - Homework? - Yeah, for Mr. McGree's songwriting class. I've written a song for the Ramones. Wait till you hear this.

Okay, I hope I can remember everything you taught me, though. - Tom, you're nervous. Here, have a drink. It'll calm you down. - Thanks. - Hey, and whatever you do, don't worry. I mean, since Riff lost her tickets to the concert, you can move right in, she'll be a pushover. Besides, look how far you've come in three days. - Yeah, but the question is, how far will she go tonight? - If the unknown is y and the binomial is x, what is the function of the equation z? Riff. Riff. Riff! - Huh? Uh, oh, uh, the, uh, the, uh, major export of Ecuador is kapok. - Very good, but that's geography, and this is calculus. - Oh, sorry. - Look at your math book. It looks brand new. I bet you've never even opened it. - I only use it on special equations. (giggles) Oh, I don't feel like studying tonight. - Yeah, I've gotta get home, anyway. I'm expecting Tom to call me tonight. - You really like him, don't you? - Mm-hmm. I've been seeing a lot of him lately. - You have? - Mm-hmm. Eaglebauer says we were made for one another. - Oh, he did? - Yeah. I think tonight could be pretty special. (phone ringing) - Hello. - She's on the line. - Great, just remember what I told you. - Hello. Hello, Riff? Hi, it's Tom. - Tom? - Yeah, Tom Roberts. Football player? - No. - I talk about the weather a lot. - Oh, yeah. Hey, Kate, it's Tom Roberts on the phone. - Tom? Why would he call me here? - So how's it been? - Oh. Little dry lately. - Yeah, but I hear it's raining cats and dogs in Idaho. - Yes, yes! Oh, man, it's goin' great. - Great, great, now just. - Listen, I'm just lying here in my new van, my beautiful waterbed, listening to the Ramones' brand new album on this fantastically expensive stereo, wondering if you'd like to maybe go out tonight and get drunk. - All right. - Listen, I really wish you'd reconsider, what? - Sure, I'll go out with you tonight. - You can't do that, he's mine. - You will? - [Riff] Just find a date for Kate, okay? - Great, I will. Listen, I'll pick you both up in about an hour. We got it. - [Kate] Riff, how can you go out with him? - You know, I never thought about Tom until you mentioned him. - What? - I mean, it'd be a change for me, don't you think? I never went in much for the jock type. - Oh, cut it out. (laughing) What about me? What about tonight? - Don't worry. You'll be in the back seat with Eaglebauer. He's lots of fun. (gags) - I don't wanna have fun. I wanna be with Tom. (Riff giggling) - Hey, I'm only kidding, Kate. I wouldn't do that to you, huh? I'll take care of Eaglebauer. You can have Tom all to yourself, hmm? - Shouldn't kid like that, Riff. - [Riff] Ah, shouldn't kid like that, Riff. - You know how hot I am for him. - Hot? - Yes, hot. - Whoa, hot, off the lips of Kate, my goodness. (giggling) - Ha ha ha, we did it. We did it. I got you a date with Kate. Whoo-hoo! - Oh. - Hot equals Joey Ramone. - No, hot equals Tom. (groans) - Oh, man, I can't believe it. - You gotta remember. - I can't believe it was that easy. - He looks like a little cherub or something. Looks like he's gonna fly away to heaven. - Oh, god. - He's so sweet-looking. - That's why I like him. He's kinda like a cream puff. - I like him. - Yeah, well, I like Joey Ramone 'cause he's tall and handsome. He looks like a poem to me. - A poem? - We get them drunk, we go in the back, we hit the waterbed. - We gotta take turns in the back. - All he eats is pizza. I just love the way he just holds the pizza dripping above his mouth. He just slithers and slides it into his mouth. It's so sexy the way it (slurps). - Gross.

(audience booing) - Sister Maria Teresa and sister Teresa Maria. (all cheering) Coming next week at the Rockatorium-- - Now, that's a step in the right direction. And to keep this administration moving forward, I've made a list of new school policy, which I would like instituted immediately. Take this down. Girls, skirts below their knees. And boys' hair above their collar. And I think it would be tidy if they wore neckties. And lunch is to be cut down to half an hour because I am doubling up on silent study hall. Well, I think that should teach them a lesson in deportment. - How do you spell that? - D-E-portment. - Now I want you to meet the two winners of the Screamin' Steve ticket contest, Riff Randell and Kate Rambeau!

Go, go. - On behalf of the students from Vince Lombardi High who are here tonight, I'd just like to say one thing: Screw you, Principal Togar. We made it to the concert anyway, yeah! - Who says today's youth has nothin' to say, huh? (all cheering) - Those girls have turned the whole school against me. Hansel, Gretel, I want you to crash that concert. I want Randell and Rambeau brought back here immediately. (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) - So you're Kate Rambeau, huh? - Yeah. - [Steve] You know, I just loved your latest Scientific American. - Thanks. - Hey, would you two lovely ladies like to see Screamin' Steve in action as he interviews the Ramones? - Oh, great.

Ya ready, here we go. - Hey, you wanna keep it down out here? They're tuning up. - How'd you get in there? - Professional secret. What's this stuff? - Stuff that's gonna prove to the Ramones that I can write songs for them, so out of my way, dew drop. - I'm sorry, but the Ramones' manager, a personal friend of mine, put me in charge of keeping everyone out. - [Manager] What's all the trouble, Angel, baby, huh? Screamin'. - Well. - Good to see ya. - Long time, right? - Who are these two? - These are Screamin' Steve's contest winners. - Oh, sorry, girls, you'll have to wait outside. - Oh, man. - Can't we just watch? - Angel, dearest, why don't you see these sweet young things to their seats? - We'll go ourselves, thanks. - It's gonna be okay. - Yeah, Screamin', I was wondering if you could give us a little more airtime. - I'm hittin' it once an hour as it is. - Well, you can do a little better.

(all cheering and applauding) - Hey, guys, you know, people say that your music is loud and destructive, and lethal to mice, but I think you're the Beethovens of our time. - [Students] Aww. - That was a good one, Mr. McGree. (suspenseful music) (liquids gurgling) - Right, Kate, is it a go? - It's a go. - [Riff] All right, everybody, follow me. We're gonna evacuate. - I guess we should rush the building. - Not so fast, look. - They're coming out. It's over. We won. - Ladies and gentlemen, school is out. It appears as if the final bell has rung for these students. Has Riff Randell given up? Has she and her fellow classmates failed Miss Togar's final exam? Is this the end of Rock 'n' Roll High? - And just what do you have to say for yourself, young lady? - I've seen the errors of my ways. I'd just like to say to all students everywhere that you may think the school is yours for a while, but it's always run by the principal and her administration. - Oh, that's nice. - Vince Lombardi High is, is your school, Miss Togar, so you can have it. - Well, I'm very happy to see that you've come to your senses. And what would you have done with the school, anyway? - Rock the roof off it. Hit it, Marky!
