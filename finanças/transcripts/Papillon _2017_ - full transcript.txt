What do you know, boys? Hey, Papi, get over here. I got someone I want you to meet. Roland Legrand. Caught this fucking goat singing like a canary to the police. This is what happens when you cross me. Get this piece of shit out of here. So, what do you got for me? Piece of cake, just like you said. You pocket any for yourself? Yeah, just a couple of the big ones. You sure got some balls on you. You try to hustle me, and I'll cut them the fuck off. Good for 10,000. Did you have a good night? - Yup. - At least you did. Maybe this'll cheer you up. Take it. It's for you. A couple of the big ones for us. You're crazy. Where you going? Castili doesn't want me leaving early. To hell with Castili. Let's go have some fun. Let's turn that frown upside down. I know you want to have some fun. I love you. Say that again. Slower. I... ...love... ...you. I want a house. In the countryside, like where you grew up. You make it sound so nice, riding our little horsey around. Let's go today. How am I going to earn in the country? There's nothing to steal. We'll get jobs. I made more last night than most people in the country make in a year. Give me six months. I'll be making more money than Castili and all those bums. Hey. I don't want to wait six months. I'm here for the rent. All right. I'm coming, I'm coming. - It's him. - What the fuck? You're under arrest for the murder of Roland Legrand. What are you talking about? Well, he was murdered last night. A witness identified you. The pimp Roland Legrand. You know him, right? You got the wrong guy, pal. I was with her all night. Come on. Let's go. - All right, let me get dressed. - No, no, no, no, no. We got some stripes at the station for you, pretty boy. - This is bullshit. - Cuff him. - I didn't kill anyone. - You can't do that. - He was with me. - Nenette, relax. - They got nothing. - Nobody believes a whore. - Nenette! - Get back in your room. Honestly, I'll be back in no time. - Papi! Papi! - Don't worry. Don't worry. Papi! Papi! Papi! He didn't kill anyone! He was with me! Step away from the bars. I can't believe they gave you a life sentence. You need to appeal. Appeal what? Nenette, this is a frame-up. They're all in on it. I just need to concentrate on breaking out. Okay. First thing I'm going to do when I get back is kill that lying rat witness and anyone who has anything to do with this. Calm down. All visitors have to leave. Nenette, you need to forget about me. Don't say that. - I love you. - Time's up, lady. Papi, I love you. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Get your hands off me! - Come on. Come on. Papillon, right? They fucked you good, huh? Framed you for murder. Say you're one hell of a safe cracker. I'm more of a smash-and-grab guy myself. Name's Julot. Got any money? No? Get some. You'll never escape without it. All right. Let's go. Let's keep going. Let's keep going. - Next. Move forward. - Next. Come on. Line five. - Let's go, let's go. - Move. - Next. - Next. - Line up. - Go to the end. Come on. Move along. - Stay in line. - Hey. Perhaps I could speak with your supervisor. Sure. Whatever you say. Louis Dega. Guy's a millionaire. Busted making counterfeit defense bonds. - All right. Next. - Won't last long. Every con in the prison will want to cut him open to get the money he's carrying. Next. As of this moment, you are the property of the penal administration of French Guiana. After serving your full term in prison, you will remain in South America as workers and colonists for a period equal to that of your original sentence. This is for the greater good that is French expansion. As for France, she has disowned you. She has rid herself of you altogether. Forget France. Now dress yourself. - I'm going to hell. - God, please. Keep walking. Mr. Dega. Your appeal is in a few weeks. Be strong, Louis. I love you. I love you. You'll be home before Christmas. Dega. Mr. Dega, here. Look this way. Mr. Dega. ...69, 70. - Move it. - That's enough. Pick your feet up. - Hey, Julot. - All right, pair up. Hey, take the corner. Looks like Dega's making friends already. Julot, make sure no one takes this hammock. What are you looking at? Hey. I saved you a spot next to me. You got a lot of eyes on you. I can keep you safe. All I need's enough money for an escape. Won't be cheap, but you'll be safe. Said the scorpion to the frog. We're all scorpions in here, pal. I think I'd be better off taking my chances setting up in front of the guards, wouldn't you agree? You seem like the kind of man who can make up his own mind. You're a good judge of character. Have a good night. Yeah, you, too. Hey. Me and you, we should team up for an escape. If I get caught in some half-assed escape, I want it to be my mistake. Settle down, now. I know you hide your money in your guts. Upper deck. Move it back. Back, you. Back. Back now. Get him out of here. The animals can clean up their own mess. - Come on. Get rid of him. - Show's over. How'd you sleep last night? Smells like freedom. What, you've heard of someone escaping the prison? Doesn't mean it can't be done. I have trouble seeing hope in hopelessness. That's why I need a man like you. I've reconsidered your offer. You keep me alive until I'm set up on the island, I'll underwrite any escape you care to arrange. All right. And when the time comes, you're not coming with me. I have no intention of escaping. Unlike you, I enjoy being alive. My wife's working on my appeal. I'm confident I'll be home by Christmas. A fellow optimist. I'm in for one. Two. Look what the fuck you did! Yeah! Get the knife. Come on! Get the knife! Get the knife! I'll kill you! - Steam! - Turn on the steam! Come on, come on, come on. Get back! Strip and line up, you fucking animals, or it's the steam again. All right, on your feet. Strip down. Give me the fucking knife. Move it. Come on. Line up in back there. Let's go. Strip down. Come on. Come on. On your feet. Line up in back there. Strip down. Strip right up. Hands. Hands out. Everybody, hands out. Everyone, let's have your hands out. Let's see. - What you got? - Get him to the infirmary. All right, let's get this piece of meat out of here. Show me your hands. Let's see. Turn them over. You. Yeah, this one's been fighting for sure. - Take him to first class. - Come on. Come on. Time to go. First class, let's go. Try and behave, ladies. Go! You should've finished him. I don't want to kill anyone. I'm going to get myself sent to the hospital. Let me know if a guard looks this way. Do not stop! Get a move along! Eyes front! Move it. Now! You, too. Let's go! You heard me. - Move it! Move it! - Crazy, Julot. Go that way. You go this way. You two. Come on now. Form a line. Form a line. I said form a line. Go ahead. You two. You stay here. Go back in line. Move it! Come on. That way. - Come on, move it. Come on. - Move. Move along. I said move it, God damn it. Get up! Get up! Come on, you. Move along. Move along. Eyes straight. Eyes straight. Come on. Move. That way. Over there. Come on. - Faster! - Move! Move it! - Come on now! - Come on, move. Don't be looking at me like that. - Come on, move! - You, too. Move along. All right! Get him up! My fucking leg! My leg. My leg! That's enough. - Break it up. Break it up. - Break it up. Break it up. - Move back. Move back. - Get in line! Move. Back to the line. Move. Move. Raise your hand if I call your name. Augustin. Barba. Come on, now. Stay in line. Bellaire. Move along. Over there. Lofton. Form straight up over there. Navarrone. Navarrone. Move out! Move out! All right. Come on. Move it. Keep moving! Prisoners, halt! Open the gates. March! I know many of you at this very moment are thinking about escape. Feel free to try whenever you like. We'll be happy to shoot you. If, however, you should avoid that mercy, there are two guardians who are always on duty. The bush, where the best thing that can happen to you is starvation. Or you could choose the sea, where sharks, too, I assure you, are always hungry. If you manage to survive your first attempt, you'll get two years in solitary. Second attempt, five years in solitary followed by a life sentence at Devils Island. If you commit murder, you'll be executed. That's all. Move, move! Jesus Christ. Here. Take the corner. Hey. Keep your eyes open and don't move. Hey. Who decides what work we get assigned to? - Excuse my ill-mannered... - I thought I told you not to move. He has yet to be tamed. And you're obviously a very important, very, very busy man. I'm just a turnkey. We're looking for someone to ensure we're assigned the right sort of work in the morning. It'll cost you 1,000. I don't think so. No. Now that seems entirely too high. Sir. I think we started off on the wrong foot. I think 1,000 is actually fair. Now, is there a selection of work you have? Attendants at the hospital. And for a thousand you can throw in a pouch of tobacco. - And a notebook. - A notebook? - I'm an artist. - You're a forger. And you're a safe cracker, a profession of which I thoroughly disapprove. At least I'm an honest criminal. Hey, I'm gonna need that right now. - I mean, right now. - Excuse me. I think you need to go to the bathroom. Yes, of course. If you'll excuse me, gentlemen. Where are you going? I've never been here before. Toilet's there, princess. What animal but a man keeps his only means of survival up his ass? Something bit me. We got a runner! - Lockdown! - Lock it down. - Which barracks? - No, he broke out of the hospital. - Just one, I think. - The hospital? Lock down your barrack! I bet that's Julot. Lock it down! Son of a bitch didn't waste any time. Lock down the north barrack! You see? It can be done. Lock it down. Into the jungle. Stand down. Route zero. Route zero. Route zero. My friend and I need to be kept together at all times. Set these two up in the hospital. And it'll be a few days before I'm well enough to do any... - Don't push it. - ...work. Route zero. Mr. Dega. Stop. I know you. Do you know me? Yes. Yes, of course. You're the deputy warden, sir. My sister's husband was arrested selling counterfeit defense bonds you furnished him with in Marseilles. Dega is a very common name in Marseilles. - Santini. - Yes, sir. This one goes straight to route zero. Take him away. Wait. Take him, too. We try not to separate old friends here. Get them to route zero. Move. What is route zero? Are those men clear? You're on the rail! I don't feel so good. It goes in the cart. Move along. You do a lot of talking. - I do. - Yeah, stop that. It passes... Passes the time. Get out of my face. Get out of my face. Here, you take the bigger rock. If you get into a fight with him, I'm not protecting you. If your wife was here, you were in Paris with all that money, how much would you pay to get her back? Everything I have. How much would she pay for you? You're a real optimist. Little man. Little man. You need to put some weight. You can push harder than that. Come on. Trust me, he can't. Trust me, he has to. Come on, push it! Clear the charge! - Push it! - Pick up the pace. I have... I have diarrhea. What you want me to do about it? No, you don't understand. I lost the money. What's the holdup? What the hell are you doing? - What? - Stop shitting around. - He'll get us all killed. - You mind your own cart. That little guy is making more work for the rest of us. Mind your own business. Break it up. Break it up. What are you doing? Get up. Get up! Get up! - On your feet. - I can't. Pick him up. Come on, pick him up. Put him in the cart. Back to work. Move your cart. You had one job to do. You couldn't do it. My body's in revolt. Where is it now? Where do you think? I should've known better than to trust a thief. I can't steal what's already mine. As soon as we get back to the barracks, you're taking it back. And you're gonna hold onto it this time. I don't care if you have to sew your ass up to do it. I'm sorry. I may have prematurely judged you with an unworthy degree of suspicion. Well, don't propose yet. I just don't like carrying things in my ass. He's dead. - He's dead! - Shut up, birdie. Are you stupid or what? We share his ration. Here. Here. You got yourself a boyfriend, huh? You were in the navy? What do you think? I thought maybe it meant "jailbird." The swallows. Stands for hope. First thing you see when you reach land. - I know. - Yeah? How come? You were in the navy? Eighteen months. Followed by six in the brig. Didn't suit me. A butterfly. So, you're a thief now. Guess that didn't suit you either. We should go sailing sometime. You got a boat? Can you get any of that? Maybe. Well, let me know then. Your boyfriend's got trouble. Give me your money or you and your friend will die. Is there trouble? I was talking to your bitch. And now you're talking to me. Bitch... Work it out in the barracks! Break is over! Get in line! Break's over! Form up! Line it up! Line it up! Stop. Stop! Turn around. Eyes up front. Come on. You know better than to truck your ladies through here after a rain storm. Yeah. Can you help me out? I'll make it good for you. Get the girls up here. Come on. Hey. Can you hear me? How much to take me up the coast? Don't be stupid. I'll give you 2,000. - Guard! - Don't turn me in, for Christ's sake. 4,000. What's the problem? Just wanted to know which girl I should send to repay you. One that hasn't caught anything yet. My boat is on the other side of the river. I'll be there for three more days. It's 5,000. You're a goddamn thief. The guards are coming. Don't fucking touch me! I didn't know it would be like this. I'll be dead long before my appeal. I need to go with you. That wasn't part of the deal. Yes, I realize that, but I still have to go with you. You ever sail a boat? Spent any time at sea? Yes, I've spent a number of days at sea. I was locked in a cage for most of them. But I think I understand the concept well enough. You can't come with me, Dega. You should call me Louis. Keep it moving! Get them in line. Stand straight! Down on your knees. Take off your hats and cross your arms. At the moment of execution, you're all to bow your heads. A man stabbed two guards, one of whom died this morning, leaving two children without their father. And for what? So he could go on a run through the jungle. Thank you for coming. Watch me go to hell! Prisoner ready. Keeping you is no benefit. Destroying you is no loss. You. Pick another inmate. You carry the body. Go get the boat ready. He's gone. It's just flesh and blood. Why are you stopping? What are you doing? Move. I said, what the hell are you doing? Get up. Get up, you little worm. Get your ass up! You little worm. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Stop. Hey, stop! Hey! We've got a runner! He's heading north. Papi. Papi? Heading north now! Papillon! Check the tree line! Hey! Take that north side! Pick him up. Come on. Come on. You're a good man. Yeah, I'm a good man that wants good money. Look, I don't have it. Not with me. But I'm going to make it worth your while. I got a lot of money in Paris. I'll give you everything I got. Even if you had the money, the warden will pay us double. Son of a bitch. You're lucky that guard didn't die, otherwise, you would have met the guillotine. Now you'll be transferred to the island of Saint-Joseph, where you'll serve a two-year sentence in solitary confinement. It's not rehabilitation. We know that's useless. So, we do our best to break you. Strange things happen there. Especially to those who cling to hope. Because there is no hope on Saint-Joseph. Just silence. You heard the warden. Silence must be observed at all times. Thought you grew wings, didn't you? Grab him. I'll teach you to be quiet. You make another peep, you might not survive your time here. Come on. He's crazy. Come on. Come on. Enjoy your next two years here. Dega. Hold on. Need to check that. What is that? Somebody paying you to bring this shit in, you son of a bitch? Who's paying you? Who's paying you, you son of a bitch? Jesus. I think you killed him. Get that body out of here and clean up the mess. What the hell were you thinking? No wonder you haven't broken yet. How long has it been going on? You may speak. Who sent you those coconuts? If you don't fess up, I'll put you on half rations. You're choosing another man's life over your own. Put him on half rations. I brought you some soup. It's got meat in it. Just tell me his name. Tell me his name. Do you think a person knows when he's going mad? Or do you think it's blissful ignorance? 'Cause you're about to find out. Put him in darkness for the remainder of his sentence. Or the remainder of his life. Whichever comes first. Six. This is a good escape. Is he still alive? The years are up. I know that some of you at this very moment are thinking about escape. Feel free to try whenever you like. We'll be happy to shoot you. However, should you avoid that mercy, there are two guardians who are always on duty. The bush, where the best thing that can happen to you is starvation. Or you could choose the sea, where sharks, too, are always hungry. If you manage to survive your first attempt, you'll get two years in solitary. Second attempt, five years in solitary followed by a life sentence at Devils Island. If you commit murder, you'll be executed. That's all. Papi. I wanted to come sooner, but I was afraid you wouldn't wanna see me. I'm sorry. It's my fault you're here. As you predicted, my appeal's run into some problems. But my wife's doing very well. She recently married my lawyer. Well, to hell with her then. You son of a bitch. I thought you'd gone simple on me. That's the idea. You know, you'd have had a much easier time if you'd just given them my name. It's not like I didn't think about it. I just know how goddamn delicate you are. Hmm. I fear under similar circumstances, I would've fared differently. I don't know how you made it. I just got used to the silence. If I ever get out, I'm gonna live a different kind of life. This Sunday, the warden will be showing a film in the courtyard entertaining some local politicians. It'll be loud. The guards will be doing double duty, spread very thin. This is your best chance. Can you get a boat? No. What about Celier? - Is he still here? - Unfortunately, yes. If he can still get a boat, do you have enough money to pay for it? I might, but then he'd wanna come with us. "Us"? Us. All right. But we still need a boat. You leave now. Leave! Get out! Get out! Leave! Get out! - This man's mad! - Go! - Get out! - He's out of his mind. No! No, no, no! No! - No! Help me! - He's out of his mind. Help me! - Help! - Here. Come on, come on. Calm down, calm down. Let him go, let him go. It's okay, it's okay. Bring me some pills. Come on. Take one. Bring me some water. Swallow. You'll be okay. Lights out, 10 minutes. Stop. Relax. - Relax. - Get off! I will never let you fuck me. Shh. You will soon, if you know what's good for you. Hey. Hey, I just want to talk. I'm not a goddamn whore. That's not what I want. Yeah, everybody says that until they do. Trust me, I don't. I got a different proposition. If you repeat one word of this, it's not going to be good for you. I don't want to know, then. Maybe you do. Look, I'm putting something together. This Sunday. We got room for one more. I have nothing to offer you. I need you to distract that turnkey. Get him to come in here at a certain time, keep him occupied. If I do that, your plan better work. It'll work. It's not going to be easy. Can you handle yourself? You were framed for murder, right? Well, nobody framed me. That's Celier. He's gotten us a boat. Let's see the arm. Infected. Good job. Papi! You skinny son of a bitch. Good to see you. What'd you do to your arm? I had to cut myself to get in here. - It still work? - Yeah, it's nothing. Don't think about it. I can still kick your ass. Can we hurry this up? I have to get back. Birdie, can you shut up for once? This is Maturette. He's our fourth. Oh, yeah? You know how to handle yourself? - Yeah, with a knife. - All right, take it easy. Oh, feisty little one, huh? - You all set? - Yeah, I'm set. I got a guy that's hiding a boat on the bank. It's upriver a ways. From there, it's a straight shot to the ocean. But we need half the money now. What about you? When the film starts, we'll go through the warden's building. I'll have a key. We got a plan. We got a plan. You all right? No. I'm not sure we can trust him. Look at him. He's unpredictable. He's like a caged animal. We're all animals in here, pal. He'll be fine. He needs the money now. Here. It's the sedatives they gave me. Get them in the guards' coffee. We'll do the rest. I have to get back. Hey. You're doing good. - Hey. - What do we have here, huh? Go to hell. Give me those back. He's going to fuck up our plan. He's going to be fine. What the... What are you doing, man? All right! That's enough. Break it up. Break it up. He does the warden's books. Huh... I'd have figured I'd know how to throw a punch considering how often my father used to beat me. Yours, too? My parents are schoolteachers. See you tonight. Anisette for the warden. The best you have. Just give me the bottle. There's two or three. Would you gentlemen like your coffees freshened? Yeah, bring it on in. Compliments of the warden. Very nice. Here. If we kill someone and this goes wrong, it's the guillotine. No one dies. - Give me another one of them. - All right. Dega, where are you going? Dega. The warden. Now. Stop! What was that? I'd better go check. It's working. Oh, man. We're too early. Louis, do you have a light? Yes, of course, sir. No. Okay, go inside. Everybody, go inside. - Come on. Come on, darling. - Fuck. - That's our way out. - No, no. What's he doing? - Power's out. - Oh, fuck. Papi, we got to move. We can't stay here. We wait for Dega. Forget about Dega! He's not reliable, and you know it. Let's just go. Come on. You want to go? Go. Are you with me? Hell, yeah. Open the gate. What's wrong with you? I stole the keys to get us up to the central walkway. We can take that to the guard tower. As long as the lights stay off, they won't see us. - And then we jump? - You got a better idea? Come on. Come on. Go, go! I've got the wall. - You! With me to the south wall. - Yes, sir! Yes, we're on lockdown. Section secured! Oh, shit. All right. Come on. Let's go. Easy. Lock it down! - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's go. Come on! Go, go, go. Go. Come on. Jump! Come on. Come on. Come on! They're going to see you! Come on. Come on. - Jump! - Come on. Jump! Shit. Hey, it's broken. Leave him. He's got the money. Maturette, help me. Christ. All right, come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. How much further to the boat? - You're slowing us down, Dega. - Come on. We've got to move faster. Don't take another step. You're not taking me back. That depends. Do you have my money? Hey. Papi, it's okay. This is my guy with the boat. Where's our boat? It's a ways up the river. You want me to take you there? Pay me. Or fuck you. This is all I have left. Let's keep that between us. Enjoy your freedom. Fucking jerk. Fuck! What kind of shit boat did you get us? Shut up, Dega! You're lucky to be here. Keep bailing. - Get it out of the boat. - I'm trying. Don't throw it at me, Dega. God damn it. - Throw it in the water. - I'm throwing it at the water! - Maturette! - Yes? Check the tiller. I got it, I got it. Papi, this boat can't hold all of us. You know it. We need to lighten the weight. He's going to die anyway, Papi. Nobody needs to die. Fuck! It fell off! - Fix the tiller. Fix the tiller! - It's broken. Move. Here, take this. Take this. Maturette, help me. This storm is gonna sink the boat. We need to act, and we need to act now. Just let me get the boat ready. Did you lose your mind? Huh? You want to die because of this guy? Nobody needs to die. Well, we can't all live. Dega, he's dead weight. How much money you have? He doesn't have any money. He doesn't have any money? You hear that, Maturette? They've been lying to us. You want to die for him? That makes it two against one, Papi. Step aside. No need to do anything. Step aside, Papi! I'm not going to die for that guy. Last chance, Papi. Step aside! I don't know about you. I'm going home! Shit. Dega. Stop! Stop! Enough. That's enough. That's enough. Enough. Welcome. I was traveling with two other men. They're being cared for. Where are we? This is Colombia. We know where you've come from. But you need only repent. Allow God back into your life, and you'll be forgiven. You should go and wash yourself. Then come and pray with us. We need to keep moving. They know where we came from. Our deal is done. I told you we couldn't trust him. I'm leaving. With or without you. Good luck. Papi, we made it! Papi, it's paradise here. Yeah, but it's not home. Not for me, anyway. Good luck, Maturette. We're leaving. Now! Come on. Papi! Maturette! Repent! If you are truly sorry for what you have done, then you have nothing to fear! God will watch over you. You came back. Come on, Papi. I had to come and see this for myself. Few men survive five years in solitary. What were you living for? 'Cause I don't think you're going to find it where you're going. Devils Island. Let me out! Now, what's the son of two schoolteachers doing in a place like this? Well, what do you think? I've had five years to work on it. The warden wasn't very happy with my disobedience, so he sent me straight here to Devils Island. Let's get some food in you. Rise and shine. Come on. There's work to be done. Let me out! Can we get to the ocean? I know what you're thinking. But even if you survive the fall, you'll never survive the ocean. - It's all about the waves. - What? What are you talking about? What do you think I'm talking about? Oh, go back to bed. That's suicide, not escape. No, listen. All we need to do is build a raft and get it to the ocean. The tide will take us straight to the mainland. Just come and see. Come and see. See? We ride the current to freedom. I'm a little concerned about your ability to protect me right now. Don't worry. The fall will probably kill us. Let's tie these together. I need to stay. What are you talking about? I need to stay. For the same reason you have to go. I belong here. It's okay. It's good. Come on, now, you don't want to waste any more time. Louis! Louis! Louis! I made it, you dirty little forger! - This is for you. - Thank you. Sir? Your water. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm surprised you risked coming back. I'd read the statute of limitations. You're still a wanted man. I won't be here long. My home is Venezuela now. But it's important that my memoir be published here, in France. My wife convinced me to write it all down while I'm still young enough to remember. So, is this really your story? It's the story of a lot of men.
