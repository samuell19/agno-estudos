(dramatic orchestral music) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. (dog barking) - No trace of them. - [Man In Uniform] Dogs picked up nothin', huh? - Nothin'. - [Man In Uniform] That's a hot one. Two guys break outta jail in a truck in broad daylight and vanish in thin air. - It must be the rain. Washed everything clean. Seems to me last year they put in a big new storm drain around here somewhere. Maybe they crawled up in it. - [Man In Uniform] That's an idea. Where is it? - [Man In Vest] I don't know for sure. Come on, Jack. Let's take a look down in the ravine. - [Man In Uniform] Hold it, boys, hold it. Let's find her on the map first, come back later. - [Man In Dark Shirt] Okay. (truck door thuds) (engine rumbling) - Come on, let's go. - [Johnny] No. - Double cross me, will ya? Come on. We're gettin' outta here. Been in this sewer for three days. - Oh my arm! Why won't you let me go back if I wanna? I'll give myself up. - [Matt] Shut up. - What do you care? You're out. That's what you wanted. I didn't wanna break out in the first place. - Oh, I know. I made you do it. I hopped on your stinkin' garbage truck and stuck a gun in your ribs. Is that what you're gonna tell 'em? - [Johnny] It's the truth, isn't it? - Don't forget, we killed that guard at the gate. - We? - Sure, you was with me, wasn't you? You were drivin' the truck. What's the difference? Yeah, sure, go on back. Tell 'em the truth. The only way you'll ever get outta that place again is in a pine box with your lungs shriveled up with gas. I don't know why I don't let you have it right now. - Well why don't you? I don't care. - [Matt] Come on, I ain't got time to mess with you. We gotta get outta here. On your feet. We gotta get outta here. Get some clothes and some dough. - How? - I'll show ya. - [Johnny] Then what? - Then we separate. I got things to do in San Francisco. - Where do I go? I don't know this country. - [Matt] I got it figured out. You go to Dillon's place, wait till I get there. - Dillon's. - Yeah. - Where's that? - It's a joint about a hundred miles from here. My old girlfriend works there. Tell her who you are and what happened. She'll take care of you. Her name's Hope. - Hope? - Yeah, Hope Novak. She's a waitress out there. You go on out there and wait for me. I'll get there about Wednesday. Come on. And don't get no ideas about goin' back and spillin' all this. If ya do, I'll get ya, wherever you are and no matter how long it takes. - You said Wednesday. - Yeah, I said Wednesday. (somber music) (crickets chirping) (soft suspenseful music) - Lemonade. 67. (cash register dings) Hotcakes and coffee, 43 cents. Thank you very much. Goodbye, lady. Have a nice trip. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, that'll be 1.11. Thank you very much. Next, please. 85 cents. Thank you very much. (cash register dings) (soft somber music) 67 out of a dollar. I hope you have a nice trip. Come back again, won't you? Thank you very much. 67, here's your change. Oh yes. One hamburger, one apple pie, and a cup of coffee. 52. Thank you very much. Have a nice trip, won't you? (somber music continues) (engine rumbles) (somber music) (engine rumbles) - Thanks for the ride, Harry. You've been awfully sweet to poor little me. Drop in again sometime. - [Harry] So long, Mae. - Well, hello. What are you doing here? - I came on that bus. Got away without me. - Well that's too bad. There won't be another bus until tomorrow morning. Come on in the house. Maggie'll fix ya up for the night. (crickets chirping) - Well, it's only coffee, Maggie. There's nothin' in it. - You're the swiggin'-est man I ever seen. Don't ya never give your throat a rest? - Aunt Maggie! Aunt Maggie? Oh, Aunt Maggie, it's so good to see you. - Back again, hmm? - Mind your own business, Smitty. What am I going to do with you, Georgie? Here I give you a job and a nice home and you don't appreciate it. You go traipsin' off every time the fancy strikes you. I never seen such a fool girl. Where you been this time? - Oh, Aunt Maggie, I've had such a terrible time. It's so wonderful to be back. You have no idea what I've been through. - Hmm, yes I have. Those traveling salesmen ain't no steadier than the squirrels in the trees. - But they travel around in awful nice cars, don't they, Georgie? - Smitty. - Well, it won't happen again, Aunt Maggie. I hate 'em all. I hate 'em. I'll never look at another man. - My own sister's child. (gasps) Ye winds of heaven, come down and blow away the trash of the Earth. Well, what are you standin' there for? There's work to be done. I'm glad you're back, Georgie. Glad you're back, but there's work to be done now. Go on, get the dishes out there. Come on, hurry. No comments from you, Smitty. - Did I say anything? - No, but you might and you got no right to dirty up the air with your thoughts, not you. Well, where'd you come from? - Just missed a bus. - How come? - Well, I went for a walk to stretch my legs and when I got back the bus was pullin' out. - That's right, Aunt Maggie, I saw him out there. - People wait for buses. Buses don't wait for people. That's the way things is. - Yeah, but they took my bag with 'em. - Well, they'll hold it for you in San Francisco. There's another bus comin' by here tomorrow morning. - Better take a cabin. - Yeah, I suppose so. - They're $2. Hardly pays for the linen and the trouble makin' the beds. Here. Sign for it. Take cabin number five. - Okay. - All right, Dan, easy yourself down for the night, and pleased to have you. I'm Maggie Dillon if you want anything. - Okay. - Goodnight, Dan. - [Johnny] 'Night. - Pleasant rest to you. Well, he didn't pay me the $2. - I'll get it. Psst, psst! What's your hurry? - I gotta get some sleep. - Maggie says you forgot to pay her the two bucks for the cabin. - I did, huh? - Just thought I'd tell ya so ya could pay me now if you wanna. - With what? - Oh, left all your dough on the bus, I suppose. It's too bad. But it sounds phony to me, brother. - You're Hope Novak, ain't ya? - Well, what do you know? Thought you were a stranger around here. What's the pitch? - Matt Gruber told me to come here. - Gruber? - You read the papers, don't you? Matt and I broke out together. He told me to tell you who I am. Now, he'll be here next Wednesday and pick the both of us up. - Us? - Yeah, he wants you to come along, too. - What's your name? - I'm John Coulter. Registered as Dan Barker. - So Gruber'll be here next Wednesday, huh? - Yeah, that's what he said. Now listen, I only got 20 cents. Will you stake me till he gets here? - Maybe. - You'll keep your mouth shut? - Well, sure, sure. - Okay, I gotta get some sleep. Catch ya in the morning. - I'll be around. - Okay. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (gentle music) (soft suspenseful music) (soft ominous music) - Aunt Maggie? Aunt Maggie? Aunt Maggie? - [Maggie] Here I am, honey. - [Hope] Hello, Maggie. - Oh, hello, Hope. Come in, come in. What kind of a day'd ya have? - Ah, I don't know. Wish I hadn't gone to town. - What happened? - Nothin'. I brought you the things you wanted. Darning cotton, except couldn't get 44, so I got a 46 pink. - Thank you, honey. What ya so upset about? - Me? I'm all right. Just wish I could find someplace where I could go where there wouldn't be any radios and newspapers and people. - There's a first-class cemetery over the hill. Very quiet. (chuckles) - I might even try that. - Why don't you turn in early, dear, and get a good night's rest? - I will. But I wanna clean these up a little first. - Oh, by the way, you'll have a little help tomorrow. Georgie's back. - Oh? That's nice. I hope she stays. Goodnight, Maggie. - Goodnight, darlin'. - Hello, Georgie. Glad you're back. - Hello, angel. How's tricks? - Let's try to keep this place clean from now on. What do you say, Georgie? - When are you going to stop giving me that phony talk? - All I said was let's keep the place clean. Is that an insult? - I'll admit, you had my kidded for a while, but I know what the score is now. - What? What's gotten into you? - Heard from your boyfriend lately? Or maybe you've been seeing him in town. - Boyfriend. What do you mean? - [Georgia] Matt Gruber. Or don't you read the papers? - Matt Gruber? - Uh-huh. They're all excited about him on the radio, too. He must be awfully nice, real He-Man. Now I could go for someone like that myself. Maybe you'll introduce me. He'll be here Wednesday. - Who told you that? - The gentlemen in number five, Gruber's pal. And the funniest thing happened. He thought I was you. Spilled the whole thing to me. Boy, was that a joke? You'll see him tomorrow, but from now on, angel, you're going to do just what I say around here, or else. - Georgie, listen to me. I don't know what you've heard, but I'm not Matt Gruber's girlfriend. I knew him, yes, but that was a long time ago. How did I know he was gonna be sent to prison? We all make mistakes when we're that young, don't we? - All right, all right. What do you want me to do? - Just don't tell anybody about this, will ya? I don't know what I'm gonna do, but I've gotta do it in my own way. It's my whole life, don't ya see? - [Georgia] Yeah, I see. - I'll pay ya back sometime. Somehow. I'll do anything for ya, only just don't tell anybody about this, please? It means so much to me. - I'll think about it. (horn honks) - You hit the sign again! Alec, look what you did! You knocked it down again. - Oh, (speaking in foreign language). Why do I always do that? Once more and I'll have to buy a new one. - Go tell it to Maggie! - Maggie, Maggie. - Louisa, I might've known it. - Magita! - And Alec. - How many time have I (speaking in foreign language). - Look, $42.50. I can't afford it, not even in my own cab. - Louisa, back so soon? I thought you went fishing. - We did. Up the mountains, down the mountains. - Did you catch anything? - Fish. (group laughs) - You're the up and goin'-est man I ever seen, Alec, but I'm glad to have you back for a spell. - Ah, it's good to be here. (siren blaring) (suspenseful music) - And where are you going with all that stuff? - I'm going to wake up the gentleman in cabin number five. - With a broom? - Never mind. Never mind. (knuckles tapping) - [Johnny] Who is it? - [Alec] Alexander Alexandravic. (indistinct) Shaw to you. - [Johnny] Alec who? - Shaw! S-H-A-Vuh. Come on, open up. Maggie sent me. Good morning. Maggie said you got stuck here last night and the bus got away with your baggage, so I thought you might need a razor. - Well, thanks. - I brought you a cup of coffee, too. My wife makes terrible coffee, but it's hot. Are you hunter or fishermen? - Huh? I don't get you. - The whiskers. Where did you grow it? On your vacation? - Yeah, on my vacation. - My wife and I are on our vacation, too. - She is dancer, I am taxi driver by profession. - Oh yeah, you're the guy that made all that racket last night when you drove in. - But of course I'm really an actor. - Actor? - Yes, I come from a long line of artists in the old country. My mother was talented painter. My father, a marvelous actor in Siberia. I'm taking into his footsteps. (clears throat) Do not be alarmed. It's still me. Alec Shaw at your service. I'm rehearsing my new act. It is hilarious. I will show you. - [Johnny] Mind if I go on shavin'? - No, no, go right ahead. You see, my wife is beautiful dancer. She's on stage. The music goes (vocalizes dramatic music). That is called fanfare. I make my grand entrance. I sweep the audience off their feet. Do you notice anything peculiar about the broom? - No, no. - The handle is painted purple. (laughs) I see her. I admire her. I tip my hat. She ignores me. Could it be the beard, I ask myself? Who knows, I answer myself. So I change my personality. And again it does not work. So I make a lightning change and she sees me like this. She screams. (screams) (knuckles tap) - Alec. - Come in. - Alec, what are you doing? - I'm showing him my act and he loves it. - Louisa wants you to help her with the dishes. - Dishes, dishes. I'm gonna paint you. - No, not now. - Inspiration does not wait. A bird in the hand, that sorta thing. Come on. - Alec. - Now, stand over there. So, put the arm up. Graceful. Graceful. So. Can't you look just a little bit happy? - No, not today, Alec. - You know you are absolutely hopeless. Beautiful but morbid. Think of something nice, birds in the trees, love, me. (Hope laughs) Funny girl. One moment she is sad, next moment she's happy. But she won't. - Wow, paint pictures too, huh? - But of course. I have to show my ignorance somehow. - You make any money doin' that? - Money? What is that? - No, he paints because he likes it. - The lady behind me is Louisa, my wife. - Hello? - Hi. Now you stand over by her, too, and put your arm around her, you know, like lovebirds. - Thanks, but I don't wanna be in your picture. - Oh, you'll never recognize yourself, I promise you. - Let's just forget it. Thanks for the razor, huh? Left it on the chair. - I tell you what, Alec, let's finish this later when I've got more time. - Every time I have a terrific creative mood, always something happens. (Alec speaking in foreign language) (knuckles tapping) (soft ominous music) - Yeah? - Hello. - Hello. (gentle music) - Who's that screwball out there? - That's Alec Shaw. Comes through here every year on his vacation. - Those two cops that came here, what do they want? - That's Mac and Jerry. Stop in here twice a day on their patrol. - You work here? - Yeah. I'm Hope Novak. (ominous music) - Novak? - That's right. - Now wait a minute, I met a girl here last night. She said she was Hope Novak. A blonde, ya know, kinda- - You mean Georgie. Yeah, she told me all about you and all the things you said. So I thought I better tell you now so you wouldn't go making the same mistake. - Maybe someday I'll learn to keep my mouth shut. How did I know? She looks more like Matt's kind of girl than you do. - If that's supposed to be a compliment, thanks. - No, you just don't look it, that's all. - It's me all right. I heard the news broadcast this morning. They're looking all over for you in San Francisco. - Did they get Gruber? - No, I don't think so. Said you killed a guard when you escaped from prison. - I didn't, I didn't. I swear I didn't. I didn't wanna break out. I was a trustee. I only had a year to go. Gruber shoved a gun in my ribs, jumped in my truck. He made me drive him out. I had no choice. (tense music) You don't believe me, do ya? - I don't know. I guess I believe you. If you wait here for Gruber, you know what will happen to you eventually. - Yeah, I guess I'm through any way you look at it. Unless a miracle happens. - Miracle. That's what the both of us are looking for. Look, why don't you give yourself up to the two cops you saw last night? Tell 'em the truth. The truth never killed anybody. They'll give you a break, I know they will. - You don't know what you're talkin' about. You don't get breaks from guys like that. But don't worry, I won't drag you into this. I'll get out today. - You got any money? - 20 cents. - Here's $3. It's all I've got with me, but I'll get you more later. - No thanks. - Go on, take it. - Thanks. But about that other girl, that blonde. You suppose she'll keep her mouth shut for a little while till I get outta here? - I'll talk to her. - Thanks. - You gotta come on over and have some breakfast. Come on. - Well, look who's here. What'll ya have, Danny? - Nevermind, I'll take care of it. Ham and eggs all right? - Yeah. - Ham and eggs, Smitty. - [Smitty] Comin' up. - Stop your smokin'. Oh, there you are. Listen, young man, you think I'm in business for my health? Georgie says you haven't got enough money to pay for your cabin. - Oh, well, I guess I was a little punchy last night. Here's your two bucks. - Well, here I thought you was gonna promise to send it to me or somethin'. Not that I mind. - Yeah. - I don't wanna take it if this is all you've got. You can send it to me if you want to. - I'll get along. - Give him a piece of apple pie on the house. Homemade, son. Made it myself. (horn honks) There they go again. I have to fill gas tanks and do everything else around here. - Wait a minute. I can fill a gas tank, if that's all you want. - You will? Go ahead. - How far is it to San Francisco? - San Francisco? About a hundred miles, I guess. - Well, you better fill her up. Here's a 20. I'll be back in a minute. - Okay. (ominous music) (siren blares) - Hey, Mac. Look at this. - What is it? A '47. - Yeah, I guess so. - Nice lookin' job. - Everything all right? - That'll be 2.40. I haven't got changed for a 20. - I think I got it, wait a minute. Yeah, just made it. Much obliged. (engine rumbling) - Hey, young man. Come here. Come here. - 2.40. a little over 10 gallons. - Come on up here. - What do you want? - Don't you want your ham and eggs? - No, it's all right. I'm not hungry - Oh nonsense. Come on in. Well? Well, what ya standin' there for? Come on, sit down. - I was just telling Jerry and Mac here about you. - The ham and eggs, please. - [Smitty] Okay. - Aren't you the fella that was in that snappy convertible? Thought you were takin' off. - No, I was just servicin' it. - It was like I was telling you. The bus went off and left him here last evening. Thought maybe you and Jerry could help him locate his luggage. Might be down at the juncture. - Sure, we could do that. - No, no, it's all right. I'll telephone a friend of mine to pick it up for me. - Suit yourself. If you have any trouble, let us know. - Yeah, thanks. - Where do you come from, bud? - Me? - He's a Chicago boy. - Oh, Chicago, huh? What are you gonna do out here? - Oh, I don't know, I thought maybe I'd get a job. - What's your racket? - Pick up a little money fightin' now and then. - Oh, a fighter, huh? What do you call yourself? - Dan Barker. - [Maggie] And you take care of cars, too, can't ya? - Yeah, I do that when I'm not fightin'. - Well, you ain't fightin' now. My years is too many for that kinda work. And as long as you're here, you might as well be doin' it, for your keep of course. - That part's okay, but I ain't gonna be here very long. - Until Wednesday maybe? - Maybe. (horn honking) Okay, I'll get it for ya. - You catch on quick, don't ya? - Hey, put some air in my tires while you're out there, will ya, bud? - Sure. - Good deal, Maggie. Good deal. Thanks for the pie. Catch you tonight. - See you this evening, boys. - Ya know, Jerry, I've seen that guy's face before somewhere. - Well, he said he was a fighter. - Come on, girls, get the counter cleared up. - Smitty, keep this warm for me, will you, please? - [Smitty] Okay, Hope. - Georgie, do you have to talk so much? - I didn't say a word. - Why don't you leave him alone? - Am I going to have trouble with you? - Not if you keep your mouth shut. - I could have spilled the whole thing to Jerry and Mac. I was thinking about it. Seemed like a good idea. But you know something, Hope? He's not bad looking, is he? - Cut it out, Georgie. - What are you goin' to do? Wait for Matt Gruber to come shoot up the joint? - I don't know. - Maybe you've got something. It's exciting, isn't it? Almost like having a wild animal for a pet. - You make me sick. - Go ahead, clean off that counter, Hope, and take those dishes out. And don't bother me. I'm busy. - $25. You can catch a ride tonight or catch the bus in the morning. - Thanks, but I won't need it. - Johnny? - I'm stayin' here. If I take to the road now they'll catch up with me. You see, I found something out this morning. Those two cops that came here, they don't know who I am. They weren't lookin' for me at all. They won't be surprised if they seen me around here. This is the safest place I can be, don't ya see? - That may be all right for you, but not for me. - Ah look, just don't be here when Matt comes, that's all. I'll get him outta your way. We'll head for the border and you'll never see us again. Then you can come back and nobody'll know the difference. - When Matt comes, I'll have to turn him over to the police. If you're caught with him, it'll be just too bad. - There's $5. That's all you're gonna get. - Well, Maggie, I got important business to do in town. I need a suit, need some new shirts. - I know all about your important business. It comes in bottles. You've given up your whole life to it and scorn to pray. - Maggie, I give you my word. I ain't gonna touch a drop, not a drop. - It's a scandal. The minute I saw you with that bow tie on, I knew it was Saturday night and you were goin' out to fill up on sweet wine like always do. - Maggie, no more, no. It's been a terrible fight, but I got it licked now. You don't see me drinking anymore around here, do ya? - Well, you've stopped drinking my lemon extract. I'll give you credit for that, but I don't trust you on Saturday nights. - Maggie, I promise. - No, I'm holding out the rest of your pay till you straighten up. - I gotta get away once in a while, talk to somebody, somebody who'll treat me like a man 'cause I am a man. I fought on ships that sailed all the oceans of the world. I've been in two wars. - I've heard all that before. - Maggie, let's have the other five. I need it to buy a present for Hope. - And that's another thing. Why does an old sot like you always wanna be buying presents for a young girl like Hope for? She doesn't understand it either. What for? - Well, I'll tell ya, Maggie. I was a family man once. Had a wife and a little girl. She'd be about Hope's age now. Ever hear of the guy who went to the corner to buy a pack of cigarettes and never come back? Me. She liked to quarrel, I didn't, and I walked out on 'em. And I went to sea and I've been sorry for it ever since. So, now whenever I see a girl like Hope, I'm kind of reminded of that, and I like to buy a present 'cause I kinda pretend that she's my own little girl. You don't mind, do ya? - All right, all right, but it's a waste of money. - Thanks. (gentle music) - Don't you buy her any more kittens or goldfish 'cause I have to take care of them. - I won't forget. (dramatic orchestral music) - Brahms American-style. - You American Russian-style? - I am American by choice. You were born that way. (dramatic orchestral music continues) Come in, come in, sit down. Won't cost you a nickel. (dramatic orchestral music continues) Music is for everybody. You don't have to have a lot of dough to listen to it. Brahms don't ask you how much dough you got. He just gives. - You can't put ketchup on it. - He likes ketchup on his music. Look, my friend, I'm only trying to tell you that a million bucks in the bank wouldn't make the music sound any different than it does right here under these trees for a bunch of people like us who haven't got a dime. Get it? - A million bucks is pretty sweet music. - I still take Brahms. (dramatic orchestral music continues) - Haven't had a chance to talk to you since last evening. - What about? - About you and Matt. - Quiet. - Might have some good ideas, you know. - Forget it. - I like dangerous people. You don't have to be afraid of me. - Shh, shut up. - See ya later, huh? (Hope applauds) - [Hope] That's wonderful, Alec, wonderful. - As an orchestra leader, I'm the greatest taxi driver in America. - Thought you said you were an actor. - I am still the greatest taxi driver in America. - He paints pictures, too. - Oh, that is just something I have to get off my chest. Like some guy can not pass a bottle. - What does it get ya? - I don't know. I've painted over 700 of these things. They aren't good, but I like 'em, and one of these days I'm gonna hire a hall, hang 'em up on the walls, then Louisa and I are gonna get all dressed up and walk around and look 'em all over, all by ourselves. That is what you call a one-man show. Real class. Everybody in this world have the right to say a little something, and this is my way. - Everybody's part jackass, huh? - Oh, forget it, Alec. - I'm just trying to explain something to my impetuous young friend. - [Johnny] Baloney. - Okay, then. Nothing personal. You tell him, Hope, that I just like to shoot off my mouth. Maybe you two will get on better. You're getting a good start. (dramatic piano music) (speech drowned out by music) - So many hot numbers. Don't let it keep you awake. (gentle piano music) (castanets clacking) (Hope applauds) - Oh, that's wonderful Louisa. (group applauding) - You're nuts, all of ya. I don't go for all this cockeyed stuff, not me. Music, millionaires, paintin' pictures, Schumanski. How do ya get that way? You're just a taxi driver, chump, and you don't own nothin' any more than I do. - I think I'll ask Aunt Maggie to put in a jukebox. - But she won't. - Well, go ahead, say it. - Say what? - I can't help it if I blew up. Your friend got my goat. He's nuts. - Forget it. You've been out of touch with things too long. You don't know how to treat people anymore. That's all right, you'll get over it maybe. You know, the trouble with you is you haven't any friends. - So what? - They're hard to find. I know that it took me a long time, too. I think Alec and Louisa like you. - Why should they? - Well, they asked you over, didn't they? They're pretty nice people. They mind their own business, always ready to do something for you, never ask any thanks. That's worth something, isn't it? - Maybe. - I wanted you to go over there tonight so I could show you some of the things that make me like this place. If I thought I had to go back and live the way I used to, being nice to people I didn't like, not trustin' anybody, hating things, I think I'd go out and shoot myself. - You're beginning to talk like Alec. You'd think he owned everything. - Those stars up there, they belong to everybody, ya know. Ever think about it? - You know something? I think you're nuts, too. - Maybe I am. - That star up there, you mean that belongs to me? - It belongs to you as much as anybody. There's nothing you can do about that. - Okay, I'll split it with ya. - Thanks. - And the next time I find myself without any dough, I'll just hand 'em a piece of my star, tell 'em to keep the change. - You're catching on. - Yeah. - Take it easy, Johnny, and stop tryin' to fight everybody. Be better off. - Thanks. - See ya tomorrow. - Hi, Johnny. Oh, I'm sorry, I mean Dan. - Hi. - You're up early, aren't ya? - Yeah. - I waited around for ya last night. - Ya did, huh? - Uh-huh. Thought maybe you might wanna talk to me. - What about? - Oh, you know, those things you were tellin' me when you first came. - Forget it. - I bet you could be awfully nice to me if you wanted to be. I've never met anyone like you. I think it's wonderful, and you've got such strong hands. - Smitty come back yet? - [Johnny] Not yet. - Hello, bright eyes. You're just in time to cook us some eggs. He's making an awful mess of it here. - You better get some clothes on, Georgie. The bus'll be here. And with Smitty not here, you'll really have to pitch in. - You can handle the bus crowd, can't ya? Where's Maggie? - She's in church. You know it's Sunday. Can I give you a hand? - I'm all right. - Oh, here's the guy that can do that. How about fixing us some bacon and eggs, Smitty? - Bacon. This is for you. - Thanks, Smitty. (group laughs) - Boy, oh boy, I'll bet he feels pretty. - We never know if Smitty's coming back or not till he gets here. He'll be fine with a few hours sleep. This makes six of the silly fish. - The best way to live in this joint is to stay unconscious. See ya later, handsome. - You go get on some decent clothes, you hear me? And stop that infernal smoking. That girl'll be the death of me yet. Bless my soul and body, what a pretty day for churchin'. The preacher tossin' words around like a far-off storm, and the birds singin'. Gold fish? - Smitty. - Is he back? Poor soul, he does the best he can, but someday he may make it, maybe. Well, I'll go change and put on my workin' clothes. Look here, young man, if you must defile the sabbath by reading the newspapers, wait till I'm through with it. - What's the matter? - Did you see the papers? Matt killed a cop. A cop! - Johnny, there's one thing to be thankful for. You weren't with Matt when he did that. - Yeah. - Johnny, you've got to give yourself up before Matt gets here. They'll get him. They'll get you, too. - Yeah, I know. But you know why I haven't done it? - Why? - Well, it's because I... - Go ahead, tell me. - (scoffs) I don't know how to say. - Try. - Well, this sounds silly, but I guess it's because you gave me a new slant on things. It's the first time in my life anybody ever gave a hoot for me. Alec, his wife, Maggie, and you I hate to let go of it. - I know what you mean. - You do? - Sure. I come from the same kind of place you do. - You know, I was wondering about that. When Matt told me about you, I had an idea what she'd be like. Then I met Georgie, that was it. That's why I made my mistake and spilled to her. But you. I can't figure. - That's easy. It happens to lots of girls. Had to go to work when I was just a kid to help take care of my mother. My father died when I was about four. I made a little money dancing in floor shows. That's how I met Matt. He took a liking to me. Bought me presents. I was still just a kid. I thought he was rich and wonderful. One day they came and took him away, came to my mother's house and took me away, too. For weeks I sat in a jail and in courtrooms. They told me that I was an accomplice. I carried a gun for Matt. Had my pictures in all the papers. They sent Matt to prison and let me go. Everywhere I went people recognized me, detectives watched me. Mother died. It broke her heart, I think. And after that, well I, I came out here where nobody knew me. I've been happy here till now. Well, that's about all. (romantic music) - What am I doing? - It's all right, Johnny. It's all right. - No, no, it's all wrong. But I can't help how I feel about ya, can I? I'll get outta here, that's what I'll do. You'll never see me again. Forget it. - What good will that do? - I'm the kind of a guy you've been tryin' to get away from. I'm not gonna let you get mixed up in this, do ya hear? - Yes, I hear. (horn honking) (fingers snapping) - Help ya? - Yeah. How's business? - Pretty good. 32? - Yeah. Where's the cash? - Are you kiddin'? - What do you want me to do, draw pictures for you? Where's the cash? - Now listen, take it from a guy who's been on your end of this deal. This joint ain't worth a stickup, believe me. Now, if you'll go down the road about five miles, you see the Peach Blossom Cafe. That's a good spot. I was figurin' on it myself. - Wipe that smile off your face. Where's the cash? - They keep it in the lunch room. - All right, get goin'. - It's in there. - Bring it to me. And don't get any ideas. I'll be waitin' right here. (bright jazzy music) - Hi, Dan. It's about time. (cash register dings) - What do you think you're doing? - Take it easy. This is a stickup. He's on the porch. He's got a gun on me. - Be careful. (bright jazzy music continues) - Here. Professional courtesy, huh? - Stay right here. Don't move, and shut up. - Rat! (glass breaking) (gun fires) (engine rumbling) - You musta stung him, all right. Nice goin', kid. What'd he look like? - Don't know, he was about six feet, I guess. Dark. - About six feet. Dark. What make car? - I didn't notice. - Well, sedan, coupe? - Sedan. I think it was dark blue. - Dark blue sedan. Did you get a look at the license? - Yeah, I got a flash of it when he drove off. I think it was 88N9, don't remember the rest of it. But it was 88N9-somethin'. - Well, that's good enough. License, 88N series. Last number begins with nine. Heading for Peach Blossom. Right, that is all. Okay, kid, thanks a lot. Let's go, Jerry. Just tryin' to think where I've seen you before. Nevermind, I'll think of it. Save us a piece of that pie, Maggie. - It'll be waitin', Mac. - So long. - [Georgie] How's the hero? - What do you want? - I just had to come over. Everybody's talking about you over at the house. Got a cigarette? - They are, huh? Well, you can just go on back and tell 'em to forget it. I didn't have anything to do with that thing tonight if that's what they're thinkin'. - Oh, but you were wonderful, I loved it. Is Matt anything like you? - Ah, cut it out, will ya? - Ya know somethin'? I bet we'd do all right together in San Francisco or some other big town. - I'll bet. - Sure. We'd get along okay. Got a little dough, too. Mostly 20s. But you don't have to stay here an wait for Matt, do ya? Maybe I can get ya outta this dump. - What's the catch? - What do ya mean? Don't ya trust me? - What are you offerin' me dough for? Where'd ya get it? Not that it's any of my business. - I've been savin' it I knew I'd meet my kinda guy one of these days. We could catch the bus in the morning. - Ah, quit it, will ya? (knuckles tapping) - Oh, I'm sorry. - You would. - It's all right, Hope. She just came over to tell me that everything's okay up front and that Maggie isn't scared anymore. - I came over to tell you the same thing. Oh, and Alec sent word he wants you to come over and have some, I don't remember what the name of it was, but anyway, he wants you to come over and taste some of Louisa's Spanish cooking. - Yeah, sure. Well, thanks for comin' over. Make yourself at home. - I'll see ya in the morning, about bus time. - You never seen anything like that water at night out in the Coral Sea, green fire shot full of shootin' stars. Well, I was riding a livery ship in a big convoy. We were doin' about 12 knots, hatches all battened down, smokin' lamp was out. Then all of a sudden, wham! It hits us. And the next thing I know I'm out in that water, and believe it or not, floatin' right beside me is a birthday cake I just baked for the skipper, candles and all. (both chuckle) You were in the service, weren't ya? - Yeah, sure. - Marine, I betcha. Always tell a Marine when I see one. - You done all right for yourself, Smitty. - [Georgie] Danny! - Oh, shut up. Well, I had four years of it. Merchant Marine. They wouldn't take me in the regular Navy. - Excuse me, Smitty. - Said I was too old. - Well, how bout it, aren't you coming? - Where? - Stupid, the bus'll be here in 10 minutes. Don't you remember what I said last evening? Get your stuff and meet me out in front. - Sure you wanna do this? There might be trouble. - No trouble at all. Two hours we'll be in San Francisco, tomorrow we'll be in San Diego. - Yeah, that's right, isn't it? - Yeah, well come on, hurry up. (siren blaring) (somber music) - Johnny! Johnny, where are you? - [Johnny] Yep. - Oh, we've been lookin' all over for you. - Cops came by. Yeah, I saw 'em. - They brought back the money from the stickup last night. They got the two guys that did it, too. - They did, huh? Can you imagine that? Me sendin' a couple of guys up to where I came from? - They're in the Santa Maria jail now. Jerry and Mac wanted you to come down and identify them tomorrow. - No, not me. They'll get me down there and ask me a lotta questions. They'll find out who I am. You heard what that cop said this morning about remembering my face. They still there? - No, they've gone. - Then I got a chance. I'll bum a ride to San Francisco or catch a bus. I gotta get outta here before tomorrow. - You let me know before you leave? - Why? - Well, I thought maybe you might like to say goodbye before you go. - No, maybe it's better if I don't. Ya see, if the cops ever ask you about me, you won't know anything. - Be back sometime, won't ya? - I don't know. Maybe. (somber music) - All right, if that's the way you want it. - That's the way it's gotta be. (ominous music) - [Hope] Oh, Smitty, this is the most beautiful cake I've ever seen. - [Johnny] It sure is. - Gosh, I don't know how old she is. Do you think seven'll be enough? - Seven's aplenty. - Now listen, after we go in with the cake, you bring in the silverware and the tablecloth and we'll set the table up in her room. - Where is Maggie? - In her room, I think. Oh listen, Johnny, will you keep her there if you can? We're planning a big surprise. - Okay. - Smitty, you'd better hurry up and get cleaned up now. I'll take care of the mess. - Well, a fine thing. - Now what's the matter? - You left me standing out there in the middle of the road like a fool. Never came near me all day. How do you get that way? - Listen, Georgie, I couldn't make it. Those cops came, remember? They brought Maggie's money back. They were lookin' for me. - Why don't you make up your mind what you wanna do. - I will, just gimme a little time. - [Maggie] Is that you Dan?

And I figure for a man like you to do that, there must be some good in you worth reachin' for. And I'm reachin' for it. - Don't worry, Maggie, I'm gonna get out. I'm gonna get out first thing in the morning. - Oh, you've done a foolish thing, son, breakin' outta jail the way ya did with only a year to go. I been readin' about it. - I couldn't help it. - But you can go back and serve out your time and come out clean, can't ya? - It's not as easy as that. But you've been swell to me, you and Hope. I learned a lotta things I didn't know before since I been here, but there's nothin' I can do about it. Nothin'. - I've been watching you and Hope. She's a fine girl.

Can't put ketchup on 'em. - Oh please, Hope. Go on back and cover up for me, so they won't miss me, will ya? - Johnny, people were wrong to try to figure things out. Two years of planning for something that may never happen. Take me with you. - Are you crazy? Me? One jump ahead of the cops? - What of it? Thinking of us, maybe we can have a little time together. - No, no, I can't do it. It wouldn't work out. You don't know the way I'd have to live. - Do it for me. - For you I'd die.

(somber music) (upbeat music) - I'm sorry, mister, the place is closed. - What's the celebration? - It's a birthday party. Hey, that's for the party. - Did I ask ya? - Mister, I told you the place was closed. - Who's in there? - Who wants to know? - Don't gimme that. Who's in there? - Maggie and a couple of friends. - Is there a young guy around here with a busted arm? - Look, mister, I don't want any trouble with you. - Is he around here, I said? - He's out there in one of them cabins. - Get him. Hey, leave it here. (upbeat music continues) (knuckles tapping) - Yeah? - Smitty. There's a guy wants to see you in the lunch room. - What does he look like? - He's a big ugly guy with a scar on his cheek lookin' tough. He slapped me in the face. - Now listen, has anybody got a gun around here? - I have one. Why, is there gonna be trouble? - Yeah, I think so. - Do you want me to get it for ya? - No, never mind. You stay out of this. I'll try to handle it. - Okay. (bright music) - Hi ya, Matt. - Hi ya, pal. Havin' supper. - Oh yeah? - Told ya I'd get here, didn't I? Yeah, a day early, too. I got a car and I got dough. Any cops around here? - No. - Piece of chicken? - No. - Hope take care of you all right? - She ain't here. - They told me in San Francisco she was. What happened? - I don't know. - Where'd she go? - How should I know? - You wouldn't kid me, would ya, pal? - Why should I? - Sorry to miss on her. Come on, let's get outta here. You better get some grub outta the kitchen. Might need it. Well, how do ya like that? Gone, huh? It's me all right, baby. Oh yeah, I've been waitin' a long time to find you. Come on, get your stuff and put it in that car out there. We're gettin' out. - Wait a minute, Matt. Leave her outta this. - Talk to you in a minute, pal. - Somethin' you gotta know, Matt. - You keep outta this. - Don't pay any attention to him, Matt. He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. We don't wanna take him along with us, do we? Why don't we leave him here? - Not a bad idea. Go on, get your stuff like I said. - She ain't goin' with you, Matt. - Says who? - I say so. You can take me along if you want to, but you're not gonna drag her into this. She's had enough. - Yeah. (punch thuds) - Oh! - Operator. Operator. - Get away from that. (men grunting) (fists thudding) Smitty! Smitty! (Johnny cries out) (men grunting) (feet shuffling) (gun fires) (gun fires) Smitty! Smitty. - Hope. - [Hope] Smitty? - [Matt] Come on. - Smitty. - Don't move, nobody. First one that comes off that porch, I'll kill. Get in the car, baby. You can drive. Start the motor. (engine rumbling) - Get out! Get outta the car! Now stay there, all of you. Stay right there! - Johnny, where are you going? (engine rumbling) (somber music) - Oh my, my, my. - [Hope] Maggie? Where are you? - I'm out here, dear. Have you heard anything? - Yes, Smitty died in the ambulance. - Oh, poor Smitty. The spirit was willin', but the flesh was weak. But he was a man. - Have you been lookin' over some of his things? - Yes, I have. - Anything I can do to help? - No, not right now. Sometime I may tell you some things about Smitty's life. Not now. (siren blaring) - Oh, it's Mac and Jerry. - [Mac] It's all right, Maggie, your boy did a fine job. He came in last night bringing Gruber with him. - Maggie. - Bless my soul. - Yes, we had a little trouble keeping Gruber alive so we can hang him. He's in the hospital now, but we got a confession out of him. - You're going back? - Yeah. They talked to the warden and told 'em I had nothin' to do with killin' that guy, so I only got a year to go. - A year, that's nothin', nothin' at all. Just a snap of the fingers. - Yeah, just a snap of the fingers. - And back. - Yeah, I'll be back. - Did I ever tell you two boys what I'm going to do to this place? I'm going to build three more cabins off there. I'm gonna fix this place up real nice, and it'll all be ready in about a year's time. (indistinct) - Yeah, I hear that. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. - Don't you wanna kiss me? (romantic music) - Okay, fella. Better get going. - So long. - So long. - Goodbye, Ma. Thanks for everything. - Goodbye, son. - Save us a piece of that apple pie, Maggie. - I will, Mac. - I'll be waiting. - Come on, honey.
