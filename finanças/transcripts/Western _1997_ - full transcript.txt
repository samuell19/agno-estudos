But there was some gear in it Don't worry, the insurance will cover it It's not as simple as that He got me to stop the car. When I got out he drove off with all the gear How did he make you get out? He went for my ears The insurance is bound to pay up What sort of gear is it? Shoes Shoes? Yes. I sell shoes and slippers I'm sorry I'm really sorry I hope I didn't hurt your feelings I'm really sorry I'm sure it will all... work out once you've reported it to the police If I say I picked up a hitchhiker I'll lose my job We're not allowed to take hitchhikers What a pain Well...here goes Did you report it? Did it work out? I don't know what to do I just don't know Make your phone call and I'll take you to the station, okay? It's the best I can do But if I tell the truth I'll get fired for sure And I'm not sure the insurance will cover the gear I don't like to make a false report... but the car has to be broken into It's the only way I'm going to tell the truth I'll risk it This is Paco Cazale. Is Mr. Letour there? Not at the moment He's out at a meeting. Can I take a message? No, I have to talk to him. Somebody stole my car Can he call you at your hotel? I'll phone him again later He's going to call the office in an hour or two Is there a number where I can reach you? Yes, hold on Excuse me Can he phone me here at your place in an hour or two? I have no choice The number? It's on the phone I'm causing you a lot of trouble You weren't to know In the meantime I'll make that police report The car may never be found so I may as well say it was parked in a street So your vehicle was parked on Rue Davot Where in the street? Near number 22 And there was some gear in it And...my luggage But it was...properly parked! Here in Le Guilvinec Of course I locked it. Of course I locked it! No, please... Just a minute, Mr. Letour I wanted...one more thing I'm allowed to stretch my legs! But...of course the shoes were in it! That's what I don't know! I have no idea You tell me! Okay, I get it Okay, no problem! No problem, yeah... Fuck you! I guess I'm out of a job It wasn't me! He'll be okay Don't worry, he'll be up and about in a week He'll be fine So you mean...there's no problem? It's just that... I left in a hurry this morning I didn't want to go away without thanking you I wanted to say... I wanted to say... Yes? You wanted to say what? Nothing special. Just... to thank you, I thought maybe... I could take you out to dinner but maybe it's not... That's really kind. Roland? Fancy dinner tonight? Yeah, great! Oh no, I can't tonight. I'll grab a few CDs and get going You were saying about your wife... My wife and I are in the process of separating...maybe We decided to give each other a month of total freedom without any contact, for any reason One month? We meet again in three weeks to decide if we should go back and live together... carry on as a couple... or go our separate ways It's a way of... testing the feelings we have... for each other Obviously I can't go home Obviously not, under the circumstances What's your name? Marinette I'm Paco Paco Cazale. I heard you on the phone You're Spanish? No, Catalan And your wife? She's Catalan too No, I mean... her first name. It's important. Your name can change your life Is Roland...? You mean... Roland's my brother Why? Just wondering He could have been... My husband Is marriage important to you? No, no... I mean yes I have a small question to ask you Do you actually prefer crayfish or crepes? Crepes It figures It's pretty here Very pretty I must be out of my mind! I don't know you... Mind the water That's my car! What will you do? I don't know I have to find out if the little thief locked the car like I told the police And then you'll go? I don't know You can stay tonight too, if you like I hit you a bit hard It's understandable. You were very angry Thanks, anyway What for? The police didn't come I'll tell you where your car is Okay. By the way... Did you happen to lend it to someone? Who would I lend it to? And you locked it? You know, I don't own much, so... I'm not in the habit The keys are in my pocket So I've got the keys That's something You know, stealing cars is not in my philosophy Something got into me when I saw all those shoes A crazy urge to drive off in the car I don't know... I didn't go far You found me here Don't worry You won't get into trouble and you'll soon be out You're a good sport If I'd known... Listen, I'll tell you the truth I borrowed your car to seduce a woman To seduce a woman? As I don't have much luck with women I wanted to seduce them by pretending I have a job, nice car, the works I even took it to the car wash so it's not like I damaged it You know, give a woman a nice pair of shoes always makes her happy! I managed to stay the night with her but it didn't work out I slept at her place, yeah, but on the couch Early next morning she asked me to...get out That's funny Why? Because... I also spent that night with a woman, also on the couch In fact, I met her thanks to you Are you in love? I think so So? What? Nothing Like that? Like that...or like this I got you a glass What will you say if you see your wife? Do you want to live with her again? Actually, I'm not married I lied to you a little Why? Because it was...too complicated The truth is I split up with my girlfriend and there's no way I'm going back to her Why did you make up that story? I didn't think about it I thought if I was married I'd have more chance that you would believe me and trust me, in the middle... of all that hassle I wanted so much...to stay with you I wanted it...really sincerely Sometimes you can tell the truth more easily with lies All right? I have something to tell you Something difficult... and delicate... so I preferred to write it down Can I read it now? Paco, the day we met you touched me, made me laugh and surprised me Something strong happened I fell in love with you before I knew it I don't want to be hurt. I fell in love suddenly once before and he was unfaithful. Our relationship was doomed I'm afraid it'll happen again with you Everything's moving too fast I have a suggestion. I'll tell you the truth without lies I'd rather you left, Paco. Make your lie come true We give ourselves three weeks of freedom no contact whatsoever Then, if you want, we'll meet again Have affairs, if you must, before we live togetherif we do I'm not a onenight woman. I need time Three weeks apart with no contact, whatever happens Then we'll know if we really want to meet again This Marinette you see again in three weeks? It's all I think about Till then, you got nothing special to do? How about we hit the road together? If you want, of course Hit the road? Me, I'm on the road. It's not always easy, but... if you want, we can hit the road together All right? Mister? Can I open the window? Go ahead What's that little...fir tree? You know? I see thing like that... everywhere these days It's a "magic tree". For the smell Smells good, eh? I'll let you out here. I turn right Can't we stop here? What you want in this hole? There's nothing We can sleep here and go on tomorrow No, to sleep... we need to get to Pont L'Abbe. Is okay there There's a hotel here It's not for me Come on, it's a crummy hotel Look, I... I can't afford it Don't worry. It's on me Listen, for me is... homeless shelters... dodges... Once or twice a month, a year... What you call it? Youth hostel I can't afford it I told you, it's on me. I'll pay It won't cost much anyway Don't worry. We get to Pont L'Abbe I'll swing it. I'm used to it I'm not waiting here for hours to get some...weirdo We stink to hell, Nino! I want a wash Ten more minutes! No! I'm staying here. You do what you want So? How does it feel? How does it feel to be on the road? To be here? I feel like a chump who had his car pinched... and his job Can I take a cigarette? Eat, before it gets cold Most of all I feel like... a guy who has a chick on his brain and doesn't know what to do I'm not going to sponge on you. I can take care of myself I know In any case... Listen, I'm going for a leak and then I'm going to bed You order two coffees? That was very good We'll have two shots and two coffees, please Can I use the phone? Only local calls Too bad.

Hold it. I just had a thought The sun... rises in the east, right? Yeah, the sun's there So we're heading west Don't you ever want to settle down somewhere? Yeah, but where? Why are you on the road? I like it. It's in my philosophy Done it for long? Quite a while Leaving aside your philosophy, really... why do you do it? Are you from the police? I came from Russia two years ago I came to France to marry a French girl. We met out there One week before the wedding, she disappeared like smoke So I lost the taste for stability You have any questions, ask them. I'm not gonna spend days and nights talking about it Did you never see her again? Never Never, never, never. I tried everything She vanished...like that Maybe she thought she took a wrong turn and wanted the little Russian out of her life Why didn't you go back home to Russia? Because I looked too stupid I left like a king Imagine all my family, my friends... "Good luck Nino!" I was ashamed I never think of going back to face my folks Maybe one day, if I have the guts We're not getting far today No, we're not getting very far We're not getting very far I had an idea. You interested in that waitress last night? Waitress? Why? She asked us to dinner tonight We'd have a place to sleep and I was thinking... I'm not interested in her but you stand a chance, you really do She said she'd invite another girlfriend so maybe we could turn around and go back as we're not getting very far I bet you can't walk on your head Walk on your head What do you mean? Watch Watch Go on See? I can walk on my head That's not your head, it's your hands No, it's my head. Watch Watch me. You've landed on an expert Let's go. Come on! You ever went to Russia? No, but maybe I'll get the chance one day It's a big, big country I thought... You thought compared to Spain, Russia... Paella, of course... No, Spain is very near to France I've never been there It's easy to go to Spain. Russia is 1,000 miles But I did... Right, it's not exactly close... I did actually... When I went... I have a friend who went to Galicia Ah, Galicia It's wild They have mussels in Galicia as well Very big mussels They do have mussels. And not only mussels! Not only mussels. They also have... those whatsit...Celtic things I heard there's actually no Celtic influence... In Spain, Galicia There is in Galicia I heard it's a myth A myth?

Like I said, now I appreciate French wine We haven't clinked glasses Where I come from, we drink to get smashed Simple as that Now I appreciate French wine because...

I don't poke in your things. I picked it up You left it lying around. I found it and saw two were gone Two rubbers! Two rubbers... You know what? Guenaelle's cousin is getting married this weekend out near Ploneour... Ploneour Lanvern, you know? I know There's a party in the village hall You wanna go? It means going back the way we came, but we could Where's Paco? He's here He's somewhere Having fun? Drink? No. I'll find him and come back Don't what? You had a good time You bet Cheers I want to drink with you Russian style. Go on I give you a little wine Watch, Paco No, like this Down the hatch Down it! I'm not thirsty Do it. Do it! Fucking do it! Don't shout at her Why you girls all around the world the same? Why? Tell me! Say something! You not capable of any deep feelings? I tell you. Deep feelings... deep feelings to you are like Greek And then you have the gall to complain that you're not understood! You're only interested in goodlooking guys You don't know how to look at a man Simply a man Feel and see what is inside him... simply inside him You know why? You want I tell you why? Because you only interested in appearance! Fucking goddamn shit! Simply... Sorry, Paco. I spoiled your evening You're my pal, I spoiled your evening but not on purpose There's a good example A lady. Simply...simply sitting Look how she's sitting. Simply There's no strength, no fucking strength Sorry I say "fucking" and "goddamn shit" but me being a foreigner, I learn here in France several words: "fucking", "goddamn shit", "go to hell" Sorry, lady. But I also learn a good word: "You have beautiful eyes" And that's the truth Can't we stop? If we're hitching there's no point walking You see that town? I see it I'm sure, in that town, there has to be a woman for you A woman who loves you but doesn't know it yet I'm even sure... that in every single town in France there's at least one woman who'd love you if she knew you I mean at least one! One is the minimum So in all the towns in France... Think about it. Add them all up It's crazy. The potential is enormous! The only problem with that town is how to meet her She's there So we cross the river! But to meet her, to meet her... we have to locate her so that you can meet And you will. You know what we'll do? I have an idea We'll do an opinion poll Opinion poll? We'll make up a questionnaire and pretend we're doing a poll about women. For a newspaper, for instance So we can question women without making them suspicious Now, important... The subject of the poll. We'll tell them it's a poll about the ideal man That way, we'll know right away which woman suits you the best... appeals to you the most... ...and is almost sure to like you That's how we locate her That's it But wait. Are you sure this...poll is reliable? Reliable, yes... if we ask the right questions ...and find the single women You list the girls' names up to "P", I'll do the rest Get the addresses, too I have an idea for a question. How about this? "Do you want... for a woman to like philosophy in men?" No, that's not it If she likes men...who like philosophy? That's it I thought about another one "Does your ideal man necessarily have to be French?" That's damn good And part two: "Do you like Russians?" No, we can't ask if they like Russians. It's too direct "Do you like fat men?" What's your questionnaire, guys? Looks interesting Tell him It's a questionnaire for women About the ideal man Wide subject Can I ask you something? Go ahead What's your name? Baptiste Nice to meet you Nino, Russian from ltaly Ask your question! Paco, Spanish from Catalonia Great Ivory Coaster from Brittany Here's my question: How did you meet your girlfriend? That's easy. By playing "Good Morning France" What's the matter? "Good Morning France"? I know. I saw on TV one day... No, it's a game I made up with some pals It's fun. It goes like this There are three of us, all at separate tables Got it? Somebody walks by If it's my turn, I say "Good morning" If he says "Good morning" back, I score a point If he doesn't... Okay Why "France"? Because the passersby are French We're not French Who cares? Anyone can play Not everyone in France is French. If it's a girl you get two points That's good Good morning! 'Morning I get a point Do kids count? No Good morning! Zero One point for me Check out the dog! He scores three points. Get it? Go back where you belong I already am No points for me, obviously! Good morning, girls That makes four Not three? Three for you I'm in the lead Good morning France! Have to take the stairs. The elevator's down Never mind Let's go Wait a second. Tell me one thing I'm going to ask you something. Tell me... frankly and directly I never ask direct questions but I have to ask this one Get the fuck on with it! Wait... Ask the question! Is your girlfriend nice? Great question! She's wonderful, she's nice Where are the stairs? Over there Look out, Nino. You'll hurt yourself We'll make it, you'll see Fuck, this hurts! Concentrate your strength instead of fucking singing! Wait... Help me That's it. Go right, right! I mean left, left Okay, let's go Go on, go on! Okay, here goes This is no time for a women's questionnaire! I told you she was nice. Go on, explain to her We'd like...if you could... He said you could... What's this about? I'll explain. Wait, Paco We met this great guy, Pastis. We met him... Baptiste! Sorry. Baptiste What we want, my own sweet love, is for you to type their questionnaire What questionnaire? A questionnaire about a poll. A poll... What poll? First let me say your husband is great We know that. Everyone knows I'm a Breton and Bretons are... Wait, wait, Baptiste It's about a questionnaire because Paco and l, we're studying philosophy. We're doing a... Why do you always laugh? Shit! Let me explain Wait, wait! Honey, honey They need a questionnaire for an opinion poll But tell me... About the ideal man You take their list It's not about women? Good night. Sleep well Thanks a lot If you need anything, just ask Miss Quelec? This is an opinion poll An opinion poll Oh, yes. About what? "Do you like a man who shows philosophy in his life?" Yes Passionately, a lot, a little, very little, or not at all? A lot Passionately? A lot Good. Now the next one: "For you, does the ideal man necessarily have to be French?" No, not necessarily In that case, I suppose even... if he's Russian... Why not? Do you like Victor Hugo? I've never read Victor Hugo. I'd say...I don't know Okay, never mind It really doesn't matter You have beautiful eyes Thank you It's true Ask me your questions! How would you describe your ideal man? Ideal man? I don't know I'd say...he's a good driver Would you rather he was tall, thin, beefy, small... or you don't mind how he's built? He should be average height and strong I haven't got "strong". Beefy, thin... Beefy, average height What if he's small but has tons of charm? As long as he's taller than me A bit taller? Let's say not smaller Right Actually... How tall are you? Five feet two Five two. I'll note it just in case So, upwards of five two... Five one would do, though, wouldn't it? As long as he's not too small...No? What's an inch between friends? Hey guys! How's the vote count going? It's going fine There's a very interesting one amongst the chicks I met This one. Look I absolutely have to meet her! How can we do it? I've thought of that. As we have her address I can meet her accidentally on purpose You'll see, she's nice I'll try to meet her in a bar for a drink and as soon as the mood is right I'll make up a reason to leave and it's over to you You think she'll come? She'll come. I think so. If not, she would have refused You think it'll work? You have a lot of attributes Yeah, you're right Let's sit at a table. It looks more respectable and that way we'll see her coming. Okay? Yeah, you're right Here she comes The chick from the poll Fougere You like to drink something? A cup of tea And a beer for me Please? One tea, one beer So you do opinion polls? Is it interesting? Yes, very interesting You have to show...psychology and I have to admit Nino does it much better than me He shows... a lot of... What can I say? He's an expert psychologist?

Two beds for two nights The shelter manager is nice, eh? Yeah, we talked. He's a cool guy Do you think... he would lend me some money till the wire comes through? Do they do that? He can ask, yeah? The effect she has on me... is incredible You've really got to see her What about Marinette? I'm all mixed up She still matters enormously... and all this is because of her God, this woman is... And she intimidates me, you know? She has a personality... I don't know... Something... incredible Can you write? What? Can you write? Of course I can write I don't mean that Can you write fancy sentences, phrases? Yeah, why? Help me write a letter for Antoine, okay? Maybe you could start by... giving him your news. Tell him how things are going I think he wants to say, "Dad, it's no good. I feel bad" You can't start a letter with "Dad, it's no good" Why not? I think it's an okay start "Dad, it's no good..." What do you think, Antoine? It's not a bad start I don't know I don't think much of it Suggest something else What do you want, Antoine? What I want is impossible Yeah, but... if it was possible, what would you want? If it was possible, I'd want to go home That's where he lives There? I've been thinking. It's better if...

It's better if you go You know Antoine better and you know the hard life Is Antoine's dad in? Good morning... It's about Antoine... Are you his father? Yes. Is he in trouble? No, no It's a letter...from Antoine to you I just came to deliver it A letter? He never wrote to me before You know it's very hard to be separated from someone you want to be with, especially when it's your father He mucked around. He made his choice Yes, but... mucking around can sometimes help you see more clearly I won't have him setting a bad example for the kids Yes, but the homeless shelter isn't his place He should've thought of that Wait. Let me tell you something You know... if you don't have love it can be very hard I'm sure it's gonna work! He's a great guy I'm sure he's gonna phone him. It's gonna work We'll see with Antoine.

I'm going to tell you something very few people know You want to hear? A long time ago... 14 years ago, the age of my eldest son... I was very much in love with a man I wanted to have a baby with him It happened, and then he didn't want it. He left I was very miserable I got over it and discovered the joy of having a child An immense joy, like nothing I'd ever known I wanted to do it again, give him brothers and sisters I wanted loads of them but never a man so I wouldn't be let down So I had more kids, but always with somebody passing through They all have different fathers and none of the fathers know There You know... It's funny, but... when I saw you... I realized how very alone I am It made me want to be with you If I have one more, it'll be with you You mean it? I wanted you to know And I want you to know... if you want to stay, it's okay with me Okay? Big smile? Was it fine? You're looking good this morning Are you angry? No, I'm not angry. On the contrary It's good like this. Very good Otherwise I might have screwed up in terms of Marinette... It's much better this way You like it? It's great How about mine? Yours is nice Nathalie will like it, eh? Thanks a lot You have a nice guitar It has a good sound I'll teach you a Russian song Want to sing along? I don't know it I'll show you. We sing in G Come on!
