♪ Yes, I will marry you. Of course I'll marry you! Oh Brett, this is the happiest day of my life! Maybe I shouldn't say that, Bonnie. Because my wedding day is supposed to be my happiest day. Well, you could always say, "Brett, this is the second happiest day of my life!" You're being sarcastic. You're right, I'm sorry. Hey, what do you think? I love it. I can't believe my little sister is getting engaged. Okay, so I'm giving myself 15 minutes to finish my make up, and then it takes about 20 minutes to get to the restaurant. Did I say 20? Maybe I should give it 25 considering traffic. Did you really need to create a spreadsheet about Brett asking you to marry him? What and leave anything at all to chance? Absolutely not. So, we're going to start with cocktails and apps, something light, and nothing spinachy because we're going to be taking pictures. And then entrees will also be light, even though Brett's gonna try to order the steak and potatoes, but that's not going to fly. And then we're gonna take our wine out to the patio. I've already reserved the best table. You know the cocktail tables next to the fire pit? And then when I think Brett's about to propose, I'll text the videographer to start rolling and the rest will be history! Have you settled on a way to say yes? I'm thinking just a simple, "yes." Simple is good. ♪ This place is nice. I thought you couldn't get a reservation here. You can if you book months in advance. You are impressive. I just know what I want. So do I. You have that look in your eyes. I just think you look wonderful tonight. Thank you. So, are you ready? I am really ready. No, I mean to order. Oh! No, I haven't even looked at the menu. How do you know what you want? I looked at the menu two weeks ago. I'll have the porterhouse. You know, I think he'll like the chicken. It's good. I'll take the chicken, it sounds wonderful. I'll have the chicken too, please. So how did you like your chicken? It was good. I will do the porterhouse next time though. Yeah, next time. It was a good call. What is it with you and steak and potatoes? I just like steak and potatoes. But did you like the chicken though? I liked the chicken so much that your next recommendation, I will eat absolutely anything, no matter what it is. Even if I recommended the goose liver pate? I will absolutely not eat the goose liver pate. But if it's a twice baked potato, then I will be the first in line. That's still technically steak and potatoes. I trust your judgement. What? You're such a lawyer. Do you know that today is 1,000 days? The 1,000th night. It's crazy. To think that imagine we grew up in different cities, we'd never know each other. I think we would have found each other. The same airplane, or the same vacation place. Or a dry cleaner. I think that people that are meant to be together, find each other. - It's fate. - Yes! Or you really needed to dry clean a suit and I dry clean everything. No, it's fate. What are the chances that you end up at the same dry cleaner after all those years? Well, thank goodness we both like crisp creases. I almost went to a football game that day. - Really? - Yeah. Then I realized I had no clean clothes and I had a giant court case the next day. What was the case? It was the Little League suing the city because they were trying to pave over their baseball field. So we could make the argument that the reason we're together is because of baseball. Well, to baseball... And dry cleaners. [GLASSES CLINK] I think it's about that time of the evening where we take our drinks out to the patio. Why don't we just do it here? But it's such a beautiful night out. Babe, I honestly don't feel like I'm wasting a minute when I'm with you. No! What is it? No, I just... I feel really flushed. Is it hot in here or something? Okay... Why don't we just take the drinks out to the patio? If you think so, honey. You were right, this is very beautiful. It's romantic, isn't it? Yeah, it sure is. I've been thinking... Is that right? Back in high school when we dated, everybody expected us to get married. Other than the prom fiasco. Well, yeah... But all these years later, and the past three years... It's been the best years of my life. And it's because of you. You're so sweet. So... I wanted to ask you a question. So... Will you make me the happiest guy in the world and marry me? Yes! Yes, of course I'll marry you! Did you hire this guy? Well, I had a feeling tonight might be the night. Don't be mad! No, it's just... Alright, with the camera here, might as well capture something for posterity, right? Yeah! ♪ [AVA] Brett, could you come down her? Can it wait? This game's almost over. I have plans with Bonnie. Could you tape it and watch it later? Yeah, I guess. What's up? We need to start making some decisions about the wedding. Alright, let's do it. Remember how we talked about doing the ceremony on a beach? Yeah, that's a totally great idea. Barefoot, sun setting in the background. I love it. Totally a great idea. But what would you think about doing it in the gazebo in the park? I thought that we already decided on the beach. Yeah, and we can do that, absolutely. But I did talk to the park department and they said we could string pretty lights in the gazebo, and have a quartet playing, and the parking is so close and convenient. So you've already booked it? Just so we have it. You know, in case we wanted it. The gazebo sounds like a good idea, let's do it. Thank you! We can go to the beach on the 4th. I've already booked the volleyball net and sent out save the dates. You are one well-oiled machine, aren't you? I'm just making sure we both have the wedding that we want. Absolutely. Island Honeymoon Resort? I thought we're doing the New England fall foliage tour? And I would love to, but don't you think it's kind of for senior citizens? We can go on our 25th wedding anniversary! Maybe bring our kids? Yeah... Bring the kids, that sounds like a great idea. Yeah. Oh, Bonnie, do you love it? It's so beautiful, Ava. Look at that needlework! And it still fits after three years. What do you mean? I bought it from the catalog when Brett and I got back together a few years ago, and they were nice enough to hold it here for me until the time came. Until the time came? Until Brett asked me to marry him. You know how dresses go in and out of fashion? Once I found the perfect one, I didn't want to risk losing it. Hang on. So you bought your wedding dress three years before you were proposed to? What's so strange about that? Brett and I were the couple in high school. Until he took someone else to prom and you dumped him. But I knew he would propose. How could you be so sure? Bonnie, I've known since I was a teenager that Brett was the one for me. Even after our little hiccup. What else did you purchase three years ago? His tuxedo? Don't be silly, just the dress. I think it's wonderful to plan for the future, but I'm finding this pre-proposal purchase kind of amazing. Planning is how I make things happen. Like my life, for example. Your life? I will operate my interior design firm for four to five years. By then, my business will be ripe for selling, then I'll move into hotel design and launch my own line of accessories, "Accents by Ava." Wow, impressive. Brett will stay at his law firm until he makes name partner, and then if he's interested, we'll explore the possibility of circuit judgeship. It's fascinating how you live your life before you actually live it. It's the only way to make things happen the way you want them to. I know, but there are always unforeseen circumstances. I mean, like you said, you and Brett were the couple in high school. And yet, it took you ten years to get back together. Water under the bridge. That was then, this is now. - Ava? - Brett. What are you doing? You're not supposed to see me in my wedding dress. It'll ruin the surprise! I know, I'm sorry. There's something I have to tell you and I don't think that it can wait. Can we talk in private? Brett, you're scaring me. Whatever you have to say, say it in front of both of us. I'm her big sister. Ava, first of all, I think that you're an amazing woman... That is a terrible thing to say! Why? Because nothing good ever comes after someone says that to you! Just out with it, Brett. Okay, here it is. I can't go through with the wedding. No... You're not doing this! Ava, I feel terrible, but... Is it because I re-wrote your vows? Because you can say whatever you want. No, it's not. Is it because I asked you to wear the tuxedo with the notch lapel instead of the wing tip? It has nothing to do with that. It's much bigger than that. You know, I don't want to hear it. Here's your ring back. Get out! You'd better go, Brett. I still love you. I'm sorry, I just can't. What just happened? ♪ [DOOR KNOCKING] Ava? [DOOR KNOCKING] Ava, it's me! Ava? Ava, open the door! Oh, honey. You can't still be crying, Ava. No one has that much salt water left in their body. Do you think maybe it's time for you to get yourself back into the real world? So someone else can fall in love with me, ask me to marry him, and then break up with me? You're a strong woman, Ava. You've been kicked in the gut, but you will survive this. You know, when Nick passed away, I thought my life was over. I didn't know how to get through my day without him. I know, that was a really hard time for you. But I got through it. Yeah, but that's because you're strong. No, it's because I didn't have any other choice. Life goes on. One song ends and it's sad, because you loved that song so much. But then a new song begins and you find yourself humming along to a new tune in spite of yourself. Yeah, but my song wasn't over yet! What is all of this? Okay, so I made this spreadsheet. And it's all of the most recent times Brett and I were together and I assigned a numerical value to each day, depending on how well we got along and look! We got along every single day. Maybe you just thought you did. Was I living a lie? No, but you might have missed some important signs along the way. I was obsessing over details of the wedding. Well, first things first. You need to take a shower. Seriously, okay? And run a brush through your hair. Show this world what you're made of. People will just stare at me. "Oh, there goes the girl whose fiancé just dumped her!" No one will say that. This was taped on my door. "I'm so sorry your fiancé dumped you." This is someone being nice, Ava. I despise pity! Are these your honeymoon tickets? Uh-huh. - Are they non-refundable? - Yeah. So you didn't get your wedding, but that doesn't mean you can't go on your honeymoon. Don't let all that planning and effort go to waste! That trip was for two, not for one! And why would I go all the way there just to be miserable, when I can be miserable sitting here at home? [MUFFLED] Why don't you come with me? Sorry, swallow first and then say that again. I said, why don't you come with me? On your honeymoon? Yeah! Wait, you want me to go on an all-expense paid trip to a first class resort? Yes, I believe I can make that sacrifice. Well thank you, Bonnie. We'll drink fruity drinks, we'll lie in the sun and we'll forget all about love and romance. It'll be fun. Yeah, it'll be great. This is a nightmare. What do you mean? Look at all this... this romance! It's disgusting! Really? Ava, please. We came all this way and we're going to have a great time. You don't know that. This may be where hope goes to die. I have to hand it to you, Ava. You really know how to plan a honeymoon. This place looks amazing. Yeah, looks can be deceiving. Look, I know you're hurt and I wish we could go back in time and change what happened, but we're here. Can we at least try to enjoy ourselves? I don't know. Come, on let me see a smile. On second thought, don't do that. Ever again. [AVA GROANS] Downey for two. Ah yes, Downey. Oh, you've reserved the Honeymoon Suite. It's very popular, you must've booked that 12 months ago. 18. Well done, you! This suite has all the amenities: amazing views of the resort, king sized bed, and of course, the aromatherapy scents that you selected from our website. Lavender and ocean breeze. You know what? There has been a slight mix-up with our plans. Can we get a normal room with two beds? You'd like to give up the honeymoon suite? Please. But the fee is non-refundable... Tell you what. We'll take the less expensive room and you can make up the difference in champagne. I'm sorry, but we are fully booked. Can we get a roll away bed with that room, please? Of course. Now it says here that you've registered for several activities here at the resort. The Lovebird Luncheon, that's a fabulous affair. They'll seat you right on the upper deck of the hotel, with a view of the lake. And the Romance Rendezvous, this week featuring Shakespeare sonnets and a sampler medley of Belgian chocolates. Just the keys, please. We'll make our own fun. Come on, Ava. Thank you. ♪ Look at this view. It is beautiful. Yeah it's great, I guess. Would you stop it? We're going to have so much fun. I know there are signs of romance everywhere Ava, but look at it like this. This resort is the epicenter. If you can survive this, you can survive anything. Whoever invented love was playing a joke on the world. No. No, what? You are not wearing that to the pool. I don't care who sees me. I do! Come on, Ava. You brought so many cute outfits, don't let them go to waste. Oh, much better! I'm not shaving my legs, though. Oh wow, aren't you the rebel? Come. Here's to a week filled with healing, rejuvenation and renewal! Here's to alcohol. Hi there, ladies. Hi, how are you? Can I get you another drink? No, thank you. Hey it's no trouble, I'm heading to the bar anyway. We wouldn't want to keep you. Fair enough. Have a nice day. Ava, he seemed nice. I didn't notice. Ava, I'm just saying it might not hurt to meet a few new people. I'm good. Hey, how you doing? They have bug spray to stop mosquitoes. Why don't they have anything for these lovelorn Romeos that are buzzing around? Ava, the universe has given you a gift. This is a way to get over Brett. It is a real-life version of Tinder and you keep swiping left! Three weeks ago, I was engaged. I can't just start dating guys as if nothing happened. I'm not saying that you have to plunge in head first, but take a few baby steps. Have a drink with someone. I promise, meeting new people will put some wind in your sails. Fine. The next guy who approaches, I'll agree to a drink. Hi, I'm Chuck. - I was wondering... - Sure, Chuck. Let's go. Super-duper. Oh wow, you're right. It does taste much better with some pineapple juice. Just gotta know what you want and ask for it. I totally agree. You sound like a woman who's living her best life. If you only knew, Chuck. Let me guess. Are you a... lawyer? No. Interior designer. Nice. Wow! That's awesome. It's fine. So, look you don't know me. And I don't know you, Eva. Ava, with an A. Great name, that's first rate. Thanks. Anyhoo... Here we are at this incredible place. Why not make sure you can keep the magic going for a lifetime? Wow, that didn't take long. Sorry? Listen Chuck, you're a really nice guy. But I'm just here to have a drink, okay? Sure, of course! But I'm thinking about something a little bit more permanent. Oh dear... I'm the kind of guy that likes to make a woman like you happy. Chuck... So I'd like to ask you... Here we go... If you've ever considered buying a time-share condo here at the resort. Excuse me? You obviously look like a woman who knows what she wants. And I can get you into a two bed, two bath ocean view condo for pennies on the dollar. You're trying to sell me a condo? [LAUGHING] Thanks for the drink, Chuck. You really made my day. That's a no? He wanted to sell me a condo! Oh, ha-ha Bonnie. Very funny. I'm done. Come on, after one bad experience? Do I have to remind you I've had two bad experiences lately? Okay, you're right. I'm sorry. Here I am pushing you to cut loose when you're still licking your wounds. Let's just forget all about this dating thing and do something else. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Alright, gather around, all you lovers of romance! It's time to play a little game we like to call, "How Well Do You Know Me?" We'll ask questions of each couple to see how much they actually know about each other. Sound like fun? [CHEERS] Wanna stay? Why not? Could be good for a few laughs. Alright, question number one. What's the favorite song of your significant other? Each of you write down your answer and then we'll compare. Maggie May by Rod Stewart. That was Nick's favorite song. I don't think Brett had one. If he did it was from Coldplay, or was it the Commodores? Alright second question. What did your significant other want to be when they grew up? Now we're talking childhood dreams. Stand-up comedian. Really? I cannot picture Nick on stage telling jokes. He was terrible at jokes. And he always forgot the punch line. But that's what he wanted to be when he was a little boy. I think Brett wanted to be a famous painter. Or was it was an architect? Something like that. Alright, we've got our third and final question. What is the name of your significant other's first childhood pet? Coco, he loved that dog. He used to keep pictures of her in his wallet. I don't think Brett had a dog growing up. Sure he did, wasn't his bulldog the high school mascot for your football team? Oh yeah! God, that thing was homely. Bruno, I think it was? Brutus. Brutus, right. I know what you're thinking. I'm not thinking anything. You think Brett and I didn't know each other very well. Ava! ♪ Why did we even get back together in the first place? I mean, he dumped me in high school. No, you dumped him. Because he took another girl to the prom. And now I feel guilty because I don't know if he wanted to be a cowboy, or an astronaut, or a secret agent when he was a boy! Probably all three of those things. But why don't I know? I spent all of our life trying to make everything perfect. The best apartment, the best table at the best restaurants. But you know, it wasn't all my fault. Nobody said it was. Brett wasn't perfect either. He had no sense of timing. For example, you don't break up with a woman when she's trying on her wedding dress. It was kind of awkward. First of all, you don't break up with someone in public. You risk making a scene, and nobody likes that. Second, he should have at least planted the seed of the idea instead of just dropping it on me. Third... Ava, are you really trying to figure out how Brett could have broken up with you better? My god, I'm doing it again. You need to slow your roll. You need to relax a little bit. How am I supposed to do that at a place like this? Oh yeah, because gorgeous resorts are the worst. You know what I mean. Look, I'll tell you what. Why don't you go find a spot on the beach? I'll get us some piña coladas and we can let the sun bake our worries away. That sounds nice. You go on, I'll come find you. Okay. ♪ Good morning. Pardon, no Anglais. French? Oui. Mon canard lit dans la piscine. I took high school French and I think you just said your duck is reading in the swimming pool. Alright, you got me. I'm assuming you've been hit on by nearly every single guy on the beach. It feels that way. Beautiful woman like yourself, that's going to happen a lot. I thought the lounge lizards only came out at night. I beg your pardon. I'm not a lounge lizard, I'm a respectable business man. Yes, I can tell by all the flowers on your bright shirt. Oh, you have no idea. I also have power suits in neon pink and blinding aqua. In case you want to get spotted by a satellite, right? Something like that. I was wondering, would you be interested in going jet skiing? The weather's perfect. Yeah sure, I'll go jet skiing with you. Oh, umm... I wasn't asking you to join me. See, I run the jet ski shop and... You weren't asking me on a date. No. I'm so sorry if I gave you the wrong impression. I'm sure that was not you, that was all me. Goodbye, enjoy your jet skiing. Actually, I shouldn't do this but... Have I totally blown it, or would you be willing to have dinner with me tonight? What are you gonna try to sell me then? A moonlight boat ride? No, nothing like that! I mean, I saw you and your friend walking and the reason I approached you was because I thought you were attractive. And... I just get caught up in my sales pitch and sometimes I forget to be a real human being and I'm just an idiot who's talking too much. That was kind of charming. I'll have dinner with you. Great. - My name is Kyle. - I'm Ava. Oh, and this is my sister Bonnie. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. So, meet you at the restaurant at eight? Sounds great, see you then. Dinner tonight at eight, huh? Nice. Did you see his shirt? How many flowers can you fit on one shirt? Ava. Maybe have a date with the guy before you try to change his entire wardrobe. Here, take this drink. Turn that frown upside down. ♪ I want to ask you a question. Will you make me the happiest guy in the world? Of course. I love you. I love you too. I can't do this! I haven't been on a date in years! I don't even know if they still call it dating! How am I supposed to behave? Do men still open the door for women? What if he's creepy? What if he thinks I'm creepy? I have nothing to wear! What do you call the complete wardrobe you brought from home? Too dowdy, too flashy, too low-cut. The blue one's nice. Okay, that's a maybe. - You good? - I'm fine. Okay. [SCREAM] What's wrong? I have a zit on my nose! I don't see anything. It's right here! - No you don't. - Look! Right on the tip, see? Where? Well sure, you're gonna have a real problem if Kyle eats dinner with a magnifying glass held up to your face. Bonnie, this isn't funny! You're right, it's the opposite of funny. I don't know how to date! What if I get something stuck in my teeth? Or what if I wear something that makes my hips look big? Your hips aren't that big. Not that big? Implying that there's a certain amount of bigness to them? Ava, you have to calm down. I'm probably gonna regret saying this to you, but what helps you calm down when you're working on a big interior design job? Research. That's it! You are a genius! "25 surefire conversation starters for that first date." Ava, no! What are you going to do? Keep a cheat sheet rolled up in your hand? I think I should write it directly on my hand, don't you? Ava, I'm so proud of you and how smart you are. You did well in school. You've got your own successful business. You don't need all these dumb articles. Just relax and do what would make you most comfortable. Be yourself. What if being myself is what cost me my marriage? ♪ Ava? Hey, Ava! Ava, wait up! I'm so glad that I saw... I'm sorry... I thought that you were my fiancé. I'm really sorry! 8:01. Stood up again. Hey, sorry I'm late. No worries. Were you going somewhere? No, no... I was just stretching my legs. Nice table. This table should give us the clearest view of the rising moon. That's impressive. Not really, I just like to plan ahead. Do you have a problem with that? No, not at all. Sorry for the overreaction. It's been a long day. Where is that waiter? So, you and your sister are here by yourselves? Is that unusual? Well, the resort is billed as a romance getaway kind of place. Full disclosure: I'm supposed to be here on my honeymoon. Oh? Yeah, he broke it off. What? I can't believe that! Neither can I. And you went on your honeymoon without him? I know that sounds weird, but the tickets were non-refundable. No, it's not weird! I think that's absolutely the coolest thing I've ever heard. Really? Totally gutsy. It doesn't feel that way. Pino Grigio please. Craft beer on tap, thank you. And I thought who breaks off a wedding with weeks to go and doesn't even give you a reason why? He didn't say why? I didn't let him, I don't care why! Although I would like to know for the sake of history. Well, you're here now, at this beautiful resort. That's all behind you and you can make a fresh start. That's what marriage is supposed to be, isn't it? I thought Brett and I were going to make a fresh start. That must've been disappointing. You have no idea. And knowing Brett, he's probably over it by now. [PHONE RINGS] It's Brett. - The Brett? - Yes! Are you going to answer it? You answer it! I don't want to talk to him! Tell him I'm not available. That I'm at a resort, or something. Uh, hello? This is Ava's phone and she can't talk right now because she's busy at the resort. Thanks for calling! Who was she with? She said that she was going to a resort? What have I done? What have I done? That was weird. Why is he calling? Why doesn't he just leave me alone? Both valid questions. Hey, do you want to... Maybe I should call him back? I mean, not to tell you how to run your life but it feels like he already said what he said and you're here without him and you're moving on. You're right. Why revisit misery? That's what my mom always said. Your mom sounds like a smart woman. And I'm in one of the most beautiful places in the world stressing about ancient history. Yeah, nobody wants that. Still, I wonder why he called. You know what? Why don't we go for a walk, what do you say? Yeah, that sounds good. I never get tired of that sight. Is he stupid? Is that why he walked away from what would've been a good marriage? Is he incapable of committing? I don't know, but hey, did you know sometimes you can see shooting stars from here? See, that's exactly what I'm talking about. We live in a world where there are actual shooting stars. Why would anyone work so hard at being so miserable? You know what, Ava? I don't know the answer to that question, or any of your other questions about Brett. I'm so sorry. I've been dumping all my woes about Brett onto you, haven't I? Let's just say I know a lot more about Brett than I need to. Tell me more about the stars. Oh well, this place is magical. I moved here three years ago, when life in the big city got to be too stressful. Coming here, I got a whole new lease on life. Now the only thing I really worry about is how perfect the weather is going to be. That seems really great. You know what? Why don't I show you around? No pressure. No talk of relationships, dating. No Brett, right? What do you say? I'd say you're a really nice guy. Oh man, don't say that. Women call guys nice when they don't want anything to do with them. Let's forget about my problems and enjoy each other's company. Deal? Deal. Look, there's a shooting star right now. Wow. That's incredible. Hey, Ava! Are you still asleep? Brought you coffee. What time is it? I waited up for you. You must've had a long night? Kind of. Interesting. No, nothing happened. He was a perfect gentleman. That's refreshing to hear. Yeah, especially considering I spent the first two hours going on and on about Brett. That must have been fascinating for him. So you're going to see him again? I'm not opposed to the idea. Where are you going? I thought I would try the tai-chi class. Wanna come? Maybe next time? - Got it, see you later. - Have fun. ♪ Oww... Excuse me... Sir, you okay? Are you okay? Yes, pulled a calf muscle. I'm not used to exercise like that. I'm John. Bonnie. I'm really out of shape. I figured most of the people around the world doing this are older, so I could, you know, get away without stretching first. I didn't mean to say that you're old. No, I'm sure you didn't. I saw you checking in yesterday with your friend. My sister actually. I'm kind of on a mission of mercy. She practically got stood up at the altar. Oh, that's terrible. Well, it's really kind of you to be with her. I won this trip in a contest, didn't want to waste it. I hope this doesn't come across as too forward but I noticed that you aren't wearing a wedding ring. Yeah, my husband, he passed a few years ago. Sorry to hear that. My wife and I divorced three years ago. That's too bad. It took us a long time to figure out that we didn't have enough in common. Well, you're young and you plunge into marriage, you kind of miss out on little details like that. Exactly! Would you be interested in grabbing coffee? They have really good scones. Yeah, sure. Perfect! - Shall we? - Okay, great. - Ouch... - Careful there. Don't hurt yourself. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Good morning and welcome to the Romantic Heart Hunt! We've hidden these little hearts all over the property and your job is to collect as many as you can. They could be under chairs, they could be floating... Ava! - Hey. - Hey. What's going on over there? ...Honeymoon Suite! They're having the Heart Hunt. It's a scavenger hunt and whoever collects the most hearts, wins a couples massage in the outdoor massage tent. Oh, that sounds like a great prize. So you're in? Yeah, let me make it up to you for not being such a great dinner partner last night. But first, a little planning. Come on! Where does the staff keep the equipment, like decorations and stuff? Everything's in that supply closet. So they'll probably come out here and then walk around the pool this way. And then you know they're hiding hearts in the hot tub. You're like some mad genius plotting to overthrow the world. I mean that in a good way. Good. Okay, let's go. Found one. ♪ [WHISTLE BLOWS] The winners of the Heart Hunt. Let's give it up for the lovely couple of Kyle and Ava! [CHEERS] Nice work. Do you think we should tell them we're not a real couple? I don't think it matters. Yeah, I guess. I'm not sure anyone has ever rounded up this many hearts. Let's face it, we are legendary! Here you go. A keepsake of our stunning triumph. And you know what? Why don't you and your sister take that couples massage? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm not really a massage guy. And besides, I have to get over to the jet ski shop. Can I call you later? Yeah, sounds great! Thanks! Is this seat taken? Brett? Ava! So, Kyle and Ava, huh? You heard that, huh? I sure did. It was just, you know, for the contest. Ah, I see. What are you doing here? I can't stop thinking about you, Ava. And then I call your phone and some other guy answers. I jumped on the first flight here. I don't see how what you do concerns me in any way. I feel like I owe you an explanation. Oh, I'd love to hear that. Actually, you know what? Don't bother! Ava, just let me tell you... What, so you can break my heart again? No thanks. Here, break this. You won't believe what just happened. You saw Brett downstairs. Wait, what? How do you know that? I saw him in the lobby. Did you say anything? Did he say anything? No, I didn't want to cause a big scene. Besides, I'm pretty sure he's not here to talk to me. Well, he's not going to talk to me, either. Aren't you a little curious what he has to say? Yeah, of course I'm curious. But I don't want to give him the satisfaction of explaining. It is so unfair of him to come here when I'm working so hard to get over him. It's still pretty impressive that he came all the way down here. How do we know he's not just working on his tan? You'll figure it out. Where are you going? I kind of... have a date. Shut up! His name is John, he's really nice. We're just going for a bicycle ride down the strand. Bonnie, I'm so happy for you! It's just a bike ride. Don't say that, I think it's sweet. I don't know, I just... I still feel like Nick's wife. He would have wanted you to be happy. I know. I'm going to take things slow and see how it goes. Well, I think it's wonderful. How about you? Are you going to be okay on your own knowing Brett is in the vicinity? I'll be fine. Okay, well I'm going to be back in a few hours. Why don't you order room service? Watch cartoons on TV. How many guys does it take to chain one man? [DOOR KNOCKING] Room service! Room service? I didn't order room service. [AVA GROANS] Surprise. No, thank you. Ava, please at least just take the flowers. They are beautiful flowers, thank you. Now you may go. I got you some chocolate, too. Choco-Nutty Buddies? It's your favorite, right? Yeah, I suppose. Ava listen, had I... Brett, I already told you. I don't want to hear what you have to say. Please. I made a giant mistake. I've come all the way here to tell you how sorry I am. Well, we can both agree on that. You are an extremely sorry excuse for a fiancé. Yeah. But would you please just sit down with me over coffee and I'll tell you exactly why I did what I did? Actually, I have plans. With Kyle? Wouldn't you like to know? ♪ It's so gorgeous here. If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go? Honest answer? I'd probably go back in time a few years. I hear that. Life just went by so fast. Life had other plans. But I do have other interests. I like to travel. And I love to try new foods. In Canada, I tried eating jellied moose nose. Get out! And in Iceland, I ate desiccated shark meat. It's fermented and they hang it to dry for months. What did it taste like? Kind of like jellied moose nose. I'm not sure I'm that adventurous. The hotel restaurant has Belgian waffles, French toast and Yorkshire pudding. So we could have an international breakfast tomorrow if you wanted. And for dinner we could have Chicken Kiev and Chinese noodles and really cover our bases. I think I like you a lot. I like that you like me. What do you know about that? Can I get a Mai Tai, please? Calls this quiet time, huh? Thanks. Ava! [GASPING FOR BREATH] You alright? I must have fallen asleep and I swallowed a bunch of water. Here. [COUGHING] Want me to call an ambulance? No, I don't need an ambulance. I'm just a little surprised, that's all. Ava, what's going on? Buddy a little space, she's fine. It's okay, dude. Everything's under control. Yeah, I know. I've got it. Hey man, she's with me. Is that right? Is that right? This must be Brett. This just got a lot more complicated. Brett saved my life. He did? He was so... I don't know, heroic. Are you going to talk to him? Seems like he deserves at least that much. I think I'm just going to sit here until it's time to go home. No, you're not. Maybe it was a mistake coming here. But now that you are here, it's time for you to take stock of your life and figure out where you want to go next. Which is why I, as your big sister have planned us the big sister, little sister day we never had! Are you going to let me tag along on your date with John? No, even better. You and I are going to spend an entire day gliding into the hedonistic pleasures of the flesh. I appreciate the gesture, but that's kind of making me nervous. Nothing crazy, just a day at the spa! Mani-pedis, facials, massage, sauna. Nothing but pure joy and leisure. That actually sounds kind of wonderful. Excellent. This is so lovely. So, tell me all about your new boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. Although I'm not opposed to the idea. Bonnie, I haven't heard you say something like that since Nick. I know. I'm a little surprised at how I'm feeling, but I won't rush things. I'm just gonna take it slow and see how it goes. Well, I can make you a spreadsheet if you like and you can weigh all your options. I'm kidding. That might not be a bad idea, actually. We're just trying to avoid another heartbreak. I've been wondering if that's really a way to live. What do you mean? We're both alone because of circumstances beyond our control, but we're both alive. We're still breathing, right? Where there's life, there's hope. Well, I'm not too hopeful about myself, but you and John seem like a perfect fit. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We just met a few days ago. I can see it in your eyes. He's a keeper. We're not here to plot my future. We're here to relax and release our worries. You're right. This is delicious. What a better way to spend a day at a resort? Who's ready for some heart-pounding action? [APPLAUSE] Okay, here's the contest... Each of you has a bucket. You must fill that bucket with sand from there, and move it to over here. Whoever has the tallest pile of sand at the end of the contest, wins the game! [CHEERING] Now what's the grand prize you may be asking? It's not much. Only a dinner and wine tasting at the private wine cellar. At the exclusive and nearly impossible to get reservations at, the most romantic resort on the face of the Earth! Just so you know... I'm going to win that contest and take your ex-fiancé on a date tonight. And there's nothing you can do about it. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. What I don't get is, how can a guy who seems smart enough to tie his own shoes be dumb enough to let a woman like that slip away? It's complicated. No it's not, dude. It's the simplest thing in the world. If you ever get the chance to love someone like that, you love them like you'll never let them go. That masseuse relaxed muscles I didn't even know I had. Why can't we live like this all the time? I wonder if we could start a business, like a day spa kind of thing, just for women? To take the stress off of every day life. I should start writing notes about that business. We could totally start one, right? Ava! What? I can't just turn my brain off. Then you haven't reached maximum relaxation yet. Decided I'm hungry. Seriously, dude? Seriously dude. Come on, man. You can't run in the heat when you've been drinking all day long. You don't stand a chance. We'll see about that. I'll tell you what, use some of this. You're gonna burn like a well done steak. Thanks. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Alright we've got orange off to the races right off the bat. And he's taking a lead here. Green is in second place. Yellow over here is doing well too. Orange is still winning. Oh my goodness, he's just killing it! He's taking a bit of a break. No shame in quitting, dude. Just do it, she's used to it. I want one of these in my house. I want one of these in my bedroom. Wake up and slide right into a hot tub. Don't you think it'd be hard to be productive? Who cares about being productive? Now we're getting somewhere. Forget it! Oh, looks like the shirt is coming off of these guys! The shirt is coming off! Make some noise for him, you guys! Oh my goodness, he's just killing it! [MEN BANTERING] Oh my goodness, he tripped! Did you see that? We should do this once a week when we go home. What do you think? I am all for being pampered, Bonnie. But I haven't forgotten that Brett is still here, Kyle is still here, all my personal problems are still here. Are you sure Kyle's the kind of guy you want to be spending time with? What do you mean? He does live near a resort with young available women coming to him on an hourly basis. Don't you think it's entirely possible that he's wooed a few of them in his time? I don't know, he seems pretty genuine. He's had a lot of time to practice that sincerity. Maybe it's time for me to throw away the safe choices in my life. Maybe it's time for me to be a little more adventurous. Throw away the game plan and the Power Point and just trust my intuition for once. How many glasses of wine have you had? I'm not drunk! I am just tired of planning so hard for everything to be perfect, and for it to all blow up in my face. Brett did fly all the way out here. Yeah, it was really sweet. He's still in love with you, you know. Well, it's going to take me a while to trust him again. He's gonna have to try pretty hard to convince me. I really like it. Perfect! Is that illegal? And no referee... Pink is looking tired. What's wrong? You have too many fruity drinks? - Yeah. - Why don't you just give up? Because if you pass out, they're gonna end the competition and I won't get to take Ava on that date. These two, there's something going on with them! Orange is still leading by far. Looks like we have a winner... Oh, hang on a second folks. We've got a contestant that just won't quit! - The contest is over, man. - I don't think so. Five... four... three... Two... one... We have a winner! Looks like I have a reservation to make. [APPLAUSE] I know where I'm having dinner tonight. Does that feel better? Yeah, it does thanks. Bonnie told me what you did. Brett, what were you thinking? I kind of wasn't. I think I had a few too many of those little fruity drinks with the umbrellas in them. And it was hot and I got kinda dizzy. Look, I was just trying to win that romantic dinner thing so that you might agree to go with me. Then we could talk about everything that happened. You didn't have to nearly kill yourself, Brett. Yeah, anyway... I did it. I won. You did? Might've lost a few pounds of sweat, but I did it. So will you? Will you join me for dinner tonight? Are you even going to be able to stand up by tonight? Oh yeah. No, I'm good. I've never been better. Eight o'clock? Alright. I've gotta go. You know, I saw this ad for a wine tasting tour. - Let's go do that. - Yeah. That would be so great. There's a lot of really good ones around. Yeah. I think we should head back to that farmer's market. That would be great. It looked like there was some beautiful stuff. I have never seen some of those vegetables. They were literally the size of my head! Hey. - There you are. - Here I am. So I guess you heard about the contest. I'm sorry I missed it. I heard it was very entertaining. Yeah, I guess you could call it that. I know, right? Looks pretty nice. I don't know... I'm worried about her. Do you think she's getting in over her head? I think for the first time in her life, she is operating on pure instinct. I'm not so sure she knows how to do that. Huh... Hey listen, so I've got this beautiful boat, and I'm taking her for a spin around the islands this weekend. Sounds incredible. Oh, it's gorgeous out there. Like nothing you've ever experienced. A billion stars at night. Are you trying to sell me something again? Actually, I'd like you to come with me. Away for the weekend? Just the two of us? Well, yeah. I don't know... we just met. I know, but isn't that what makes it so exciting? Getting to know each other under the stars? Letting the cool breeze whisper in our ears? Boy, you're cheesy. Don't give me an answer now. Just promise me you'll think about it. Yeah. Yeah, I'll think about it. Great! Thanks! Looks like it went well. Maybe not. Waiting for somebody? Wow. Why thank you. You look nice yourself. I've got the best seat in the house. It's the only seat in the house. That's why it's always booked. After you. Thanks... Here, let me get this for you. I couldn't have chosen better myself. Thank you for having dinner with me. Well, you did fly all the way out here and I hear that you put on quite a show at the beach trying to win this dinner. Yeah, I'm a pretty big hit on social media as the "Crazy Beach Dude." Thank you. Thank you. Alright. Can we toast to new beginnings? Brett, I don't know if I can make promises that I can't keep. You know how that is. Oh yeah, okay. Well come on, you didn't think that I was just going to forget about everything that happened between us, did you? No, I know that. I'd just like a chance to explain myself. Yeah, all right. We're here and I don't really want to waste any more time being angry, so yes, please explain. Okay, thank you. You know how you like making lists, right? Like for the wedding? And you also make master lists for your lists? It's called an agenda tree. Right. And it's smart, it's good, it's helpful to make sure that you get everything done. So? When I was going through the wedding guest list, I came across this. You weren't supposed to see this. I did. Well, if you're going to go snooping... It's not snooping, it was in the wedding folder. Ava, it says that we're going to have two children together. A boy and a girl and they're gonna be named Luke and Katie, after our grandparents. I was just... Just hang on. It says that Katie is going to be in gymnastics at age four. At age 8, she's going to do personal training. In high school, she's going to be fast tracked to a scholarship. Brett, I was just daydreaming. Were you really, though? Because Luke was supposed to be in computer programming early, then advanced coding so he was ready for the 21st century technology. What's wrong with me wanting our son to be prepared for the world? Because he doesn't exist yet! Sorry Ava, but I don't know. It just felt that it didn't matter how many kids I might want, or what I might want to name them, or what school I might want to send them to. It kind of seemed like I didn't have any choice. So instead of talking to me about this, you burst into the change room while I'm trying on my wedding dress and announce that you're breaking up with me. Yeah, I said that was a mistake. That was the biggest mistake of my life. Yeah, I'll say. Thanks for the wine, I'm really not hungry anymore. Ava! Here, take this in case you're cold. I'm not cold. - Okay. - Actually, I'm kind of chilly. Okay. Thank you. I understand why you're angry. Is that how you're planning on handling problems in our marriage? You don't like something, so you just leave? No, of course not! How am I supposed to know that? I'm going to show you. For now, you're gonna have to trust me. I don't know if I can do that, Brett. This is a pretty big deal. All our friends, our relatives. What a mess... What if we just tell everybody that I'm an international spy sent on a secret mission to... Yeah, no. I should have just told you the truth right away. Yeah well, speaking of the truth... Kyle invited me away on his boat for the weekend. And you said no? I said I'd think about it. Ava! I'm a grown up, I can make my own decisions. If you're trying to make me jealous, this is working. This has nothing to do with you! This has everything to do with me. Stop! You and me were over. And that was your choice. Okay, but now I'm here and I'm saying I made a mistake. And I'm trying to make it up to you. I get that you're angry. I understand you have the right to be angry. I was angry. Now I'm just sad. Can't you see that going away with this guy, that's just going to make it all worse. I don't see how that's possible. Ava... I'm going to bed. Here's your... Just... keep it. Good evening, Ava. Hi John. Just heading back to my room. Bonnie and I had a night cap. She's having such a nice time with you. Me too. You ever meet someone and feel like you've known them all your life? I'll do you one better. Have you ever known someone your whole life and felt like you didn't know them at all? A Brett dilemma? Exactly. Ava, I'm sorry you're having such a hard time with this. That makes the both of us. Be patient. Things will all work out. You really think so? I can tell you from recent personal experience, life will give you its greatest gifts in the most unexpected times. - Sleep well. - You too. Goodnight. I hear you're going on a little trip. Oh, it's you. Look man, I don't want any trouble. I don't want any trouble either, I just want to talk. Alright, what's up? No, I'm okay. I take it you had a nice dinner last night. I did, it was worth the struggle. Credit where it's due. I did not think you had it in you. Yeah, you gotta dig deep right? I guess so. Look, I guess there is more to the story, but man, I do not get how you let a woman like Ava slip away. Yeah, well we were just kids when we first met. The first time that I ever saw Ava, and I'm not just being dramatic, when I first laid eyes on her, I fell in love with her. School fair, end of the night, everybody's going home, all the rides are stopped and I look over at one of those booths where you throw the wooden rings on the bottles. And there is the most beautiful girl that I have ever seen in my life and she's laser focused on winning a pink stuffed unicorn. The guys are trying to get her to leave. She won't go. She runs out of money. They say, "Take the unicorn." She says, "No, I want to win it fair and square." So what's the point of the story? She didn't win a unicorn? She came back next year, she wiped them clean. But the point of the story is that she let me walk her home that night. We walked, we talked, two miles. We got to know each other. I walked her up to her front porch and we had our first kiss. That is the most important day of my life. You had it all, man. Yeah. And then you threw it away. Maybe. You might want to talk to Ava about that. She and I are going on a cruise around the island. Yeah, but she could change her mind. Not likely. Look man, Ava's a grown woman. She can make her own decisions. Yeah. But now you know that she is the most important person in my life. So if I find out that you treated her unfairly, you made her feel uncomfortable, or you just didn't give her 100% respect, I promise you, you're gonna regret it, okay? Hey Bonnie. Brett! You look terrible. Yeah, I've been up all night. Yeah, I can imagine you were. I just don't know how this has happened. I don't know how could things have gone so crazy. Not to kick a guy when he's down, but there was that little matter of you breaking up with Ava. Yeah I know, but I've tried everything since to make it right. Maybe it's time to move on? No, I can't. I love her. I've always loved her. Well Brett, I'm sure Ava still loves you too. Despite everything. Really? But she's had her heart broken, that's a big deal. I'm still the same guy that she fell in love with. No, you're not. You're the Brett that left Ava at the altar. Stop doing that. You're gonna give yourself a panic attack. I just don't know what to do. Okay, you're a lawyer. How would you argue your case in front of a judge? Throw myself at the mercy of the court. That's not going to work with Ava. She's not a big fan of self pity. Well I can't prove that it's not my fault, because it clearly is. Isn't there a legal term for admitting you did something wrong and then trying to make up for it? Restitution. Something like that. I mean, besides saying you've done something wrong, what have you actually done to try to fix things? Apparently not enough. Okay, try this. - You like football, right? - Yeah. Okay, do you have a favorite team? The Bobcats. And do they always win? They haven't had a winning season since I've been a fan. Right, and you still want the best for them. You still hope for them to win. Yeah. Okay, so they're not perfect. In fact, often they're terrible. But you still hope for the best. Right. Right, because? Well, because every year they have a new program, they bring in new players, and I know they're doing everything possible they can to win. So are you doing everything possible to show Ava that you're willing to try? Brett, I realize your previous relationship has been shattered. Okay, we can't change that. But artists create these beautiful mosaics out of little pieces of broken stone and glass. They take something busted up and useless and make beauty. So you're saying that I should take what's left of the old relationship and try to make something new? Could be... Could be! Thank you, Bonnie! Have you tried the muffins today? They're incredible, aren't they? As far as muffins go, I'd say they're right up there with the best. What do you think, Ava? I'm sorry, what? Have you tried the muffins today? No. The pastries are good, too. I can't make a decision. Maybe have one of each. That would be wrong Bonnie, don't you see that? It needs to be one or the other. You could skip both and just have eggs benedict. That is too many choices, John. You know what? You don't have to decide anything. About breakfast or anything else. We can just sit here. Do you want to talk about it? I realize I need to stop planning my life in microscopic detail. Sometimes it's hard to let go of something that brings you comfort. Exactly! You're a very wise man, John. Which is why I'm thinking that I'm going to go on the boat with Kyle this weekend. Wow talk about going from zero to a hundred. Well, look at you two. You seem happy. You took a chance and it worked out. I think your sister is pretty special. She is and I want to be more spontaneous like her. But going on a trip with a stranger? When Brett came all the way out here to see you and apologize? Brett does seem pretty crazy about you. So I shouldn't go on the boat trip with him this weekend? No, I mean because of course doing something spontaneous is kind of a gigantic leap forward for you. So I should go away with Kyle? I'm not saying that. Honey, it's your call. I'm gonna go get pancakes by the pool. - Now? - Now. ♪ Good morning. Good morning. Pancakes, huh? They have waffles too. You should get them, they're good. I ate hours ago, I got a busy day. I made a list. I see. First up, I'm going to write an apology e-mail to everybody who was coming to the wedding. I'm going to let them know that it was me being stupid. Brett, you don't have to do that. Yes, I do. They're probably wondering what's happened, and I want them to know that it had nothing to do with you. Next, I'm signing up for an online course to improve my communication skills. Brett! Yeah, well let's be honest. It was a really stupid thing to call off the wedding. If I had just come to you with my concerns, we'd be married right now. Instead of in this mess of emotions that I created. Well that's very sweet. I really appreciate it. And last, I can't do anything about you wanting to go away for the weekend with Mr. Muscle Head, but I just want you to know that whatever you do decide, I'll be here. And I won't obsess over it or ask you a million questions. I'm just gonna be grateful that you came back. You're really something, you know that? If that something is what made you fall in love with me, or if that something makes you want to be with me again, then that's something that I'm gonna try to find. I'm confusing myself. I'm not. I totally understood what you're trying to say. And that makes you pretty something, too. Gotta go. Remember, whatever you decide, I'll be here. So you are going? I didn't say that. If you're not going, then why are you packing? I didn't say I wasn't going. I think you've been spending too much time in the sun. It's just that I figured out something very important. Which is? You can't think your way through a relationship. You have to feel your way through. I don't disagree. The best anyone can do is be fearless and try new things. See if it's a good fit. And you're plunging ahead without creating a Power Point slideshow? It's just that you know, the list that Brett saw, I was only kind of daydreaming about what life could be. Not what it absolutely had to be. But I can totally understand why he freaked out when he saw it. Ava... List or no list, weekend cruise or not, I just want you to be happy. But make sure you're doing things for the right reasons. You can be spontaneous. You don't have to plan everything out, but don't miss out on the future you were meant to live out of spite. A-ha! So you're saying I should be with Brett! Not necessarily. So I should go with Kyle? Just leave me out of it! I have to go, I left John downstairs. Let me know what you decide to do about the three day weekend. Love you. Have fun. ♪ - Hi. - You look nice. [BONNIE] Thank you. Ava... A suit? Felt like the occasion called for it. What occasion? I've been thinking about you going on the weekend getaway and I just want to make sure that we tie up any loose ends before you go. Loose ends? Can I see your hand? Yeah. What is this? All will be explained. Right, listen about that weekend getaway. Before you say anything about that, will you please, please have dinner with me? Because I put it on my list. See? "Dinner with Ava if she agrees." Well for goodness sake, if it's on your list. Okay. ♪ What is all this? We never got to do prom together. I thought we should make up for that. You dumped me for someone else, remember? Ava, do you know who I went to the prom with? My cousin. My mom made me take her. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't know how to explain it to you. I was young, I was an idiot. And then you were angry at me. And I thought that maybe it was just best to move on. I really wish you'd said something. I was upset for a really long time. I know. Then I went and called off the wedding. I felt like you were just dumping me all over again. Reason number 758 why I need to work on my communication skills. Yeah, couldn't hurt. [SLOW MUSIC] But right now I think we have the first dance. That's our song from high school! Shall we? Listen, I know that one very delayed prom night isn't gonna make up for everything. No, it won't. But I do applaud the effort. Ava, you think we can start over? I don't know, Brett. You really hurt me. I know. But I should've given you a chance to explain. Now that you know why I did what I did, does that...? I'll be right back. Ah. No suitcase? No. So you're not coming with me? I think it would be an amazing weekend, but no, I won't be joining you. Too bad, I brought champagne. Oh, more for you. Yeah. Are you sure? I'm sure that there's a happy balance between me planning every detail of my life and running off for the weekend with someone I just met. Well, bummer for me. But I hope you find what you're looking for. And for what it's worth, your ex-fiance threatened to punch me in the eye if I ever did anything to hurt you. - He did? - He did, yes. That guy flew all the way down here. He nearly died in the sand trying to win you a dinner. You could do worse. Kyle, you're a nice guy. That's a terrible thing to say. - Bye. - Bye. Buy a girl a drink? You're not going? No, that trip isn't what I want. What do you want? What I want is... Yeah? I want to marry you. Really? Well, hang on a second. I don't remember you proposing to me. I thought we were engaged? Right, but that circle is closed. If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right. Come on, Ava. You know how I am at public displays. Oh, you can do it. Ava, will you make me the happiest man in the world? Again? What is he doing? I think he's trying to propose. But he doesn't look very sincere. Come on, man. Let's give him another chance. Ava, you're the love of my life. Ever since high school, we knew that we were meant to be together. I don't want to have another day without you in my life. Will you marry me? Yes, Brett. [APPLAUSE] Where should we go for our honeymoon? Surprise me. Fall foliage tour? No. ♪
