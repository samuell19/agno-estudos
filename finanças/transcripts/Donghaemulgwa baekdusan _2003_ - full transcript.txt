What can I do for you? Now that we're here... You tell him. You know... What is it? The waves were violent and... What? We are... We're from up there. From up there? Oh! You guys are from up there? We've been expecting you. How was your trip? It's so hot, isn't it? You come here. Yes, you! They're gonna take you home. Stop giving your parents a hard time. Who took her? Who'd they say they were? They said they were from up there. You didn't check their IDs? What were you... What? Take a look at this. Fuck! This is... Isn't she the one we hit on at the beach? What if she tells the chief? She's a runaway. I don't think she'd tell him. My old man sent you for me? You're not pigs, are you? What are we doing now? We'll stick to our original plan. Let's go back to the beach and find a boat. What does she mean by pigs? Where are you going? What are you doing? Stop following us! Where are we? How should I know? I'm not from here. Let's go over there. Where the hell are we? Hey, where's your friend? Please save me. Should I get some more? Will you? More fried dumplings, please. Okay. Fried dumplings for table 3. Okay! Can I drink this? Go ahead. Really? I'm so glad we're here. Food is so good. And anybody can drink this American sweet water. What'd you just say? It's pretty good. You're very close to getting it. What are all those? Things I found on the beach. I'm taking them as souvenirs. I think people here are well off. They discard things in good shape. What's this? Is this yours? Who's this man? Give it here. Are you... By any chance... Chinese-Korean? Come on, which is it? Oh, you were once Chinese-Korean, but regained Korean nationality? Fried dumplings. Let's eat. I feel bad going out without Na-ra. What are you, her maid? Don't worry about it. You don't get it, do you? She's like our bank! Her card has been suspended. She's as broke as we are. They've got a car. They're not very cute, but we can have fun. You don't want to? Stay here and wait for her then. No, take me with you. - Let's go, bitch. - Stop calling me that. We meet again. Remember us? I don't want to, but I can't help it. Thanks for the show yesterday. Where's the other girl? She's Na-ra, isn't she? What are you, stalkers? How'd you find that out? Don't deal with them. They might start a freak show. You smell like seaweed. Let's go. Let's go, boys! What's this? That's all we have now. Not enough? What is this, a joke? What do you think you're doing? You ate without any money? What are you yelling for? We'll go to the bank and get you the money. You want me to buy that? Then, leave one of them here. I'd prefer the stronger one. Stronger one? Lift the freeze on the card now. Otherwise, I can't guarantee your daughter's safety. I'll cut her throat! Did I do well? Hooray! Are you trying to screw me? Why on earth would I screw you? It's not our fault she's been kidnapped. Shut up, you fucking pig! You're chewing the phone, aren't you? We'll take care of this, okay? Sure. Bye. What'd he say? Turn around. She used a downtown ATM. Fucking bitch! Aren't those squid? We're fucked! What are those doing here? What the fuck!

Why would I take a chance? - Boys! - Boss! Kill him! You're all dead meat now! Get him! You son of a bitch! Not bad, huh? Run! It's the ocean! Good thing we ran this way. Captain, it's sizzling hot. And I'm all sweaty and tired. Why don't we swim some? Sounds good! My friends are over there. Let's have fun together. Leave us now. We've got things to do. Leave us now. We've got things to do. I've got things to do, too! Fine! You're so uptight. Captain, look! That's what we need right now. What? You guys wanna ride that? Let's hide out on that island and leave at dawn. What's the point? Let's ride all the way back to the Republic now! I'll do anything for the Republic! Yahoo! I paid for it, and they're having all the fun. You think she'll be okay? Don't worry. We'll pay for this thing when the nation is unified. What's that? You almost killed us! Time's up. What are you doing out here, going to North Korea? Girls, I've got stuff for dinner. Where the hell did they go? 10 new voice mails The first message. We're gonna be out late. Sorry. Don't wait up for us. My cell is low on battery. I'll... talk... I can't believe this.

Believe in Spirit of Revolution. That's a lie. - What? - Nothing. Captain, let me ask you something. What if the North and South are unified by the time we build the raft? - Know what I'm saying? - On your head. - You're joking. - Now! The ground is muddy. On your head now! Aye, sir! Listen, Comrade LIM. You got some balls saying that. If you make me upset again, you'll be very sorry. - Understood? - Aye, sir! What are you doing there? Who are you? Run! Stop right there! Wait for me! Help! - Slow down for me! - Am I nuts? What's gong on back there? Fucking noisy. Damn! It's gonna take forever. If we call for backup, we'll be a laughing stock. We'll run when the time is right. Run where? And who told you to eat them? What? They ate them? Where do you think you are, a movie theater? Sons of bitches! Come on, we're detectives! That's right! Detectives? Then I'm a Vietnam vet, assholes! Tonight you're catching as many squid as you ate! Listen, Captain. Before building the raft, why don't we eat something? Our ancestors starved, fighting off the Japanese. And you can't even skip a meal? How will you lead the army and unify the nation? You know what? I wouldn't mind tailing the army. I've got to go eat. You can lead the army for me. Comrade LIM! I'm coming with you. Wow! He knows all the songs I like. Help yourself. I'm sorry we keep asking you to treat us. So am I. Why don't you eat some? No, I'm on a diet. What, dynamite? Why is that so surprising? Your name is Dong-hae, right? I can't believe you like this old song. Then again, you look pretty old. You like young girls, don't you?

You should have agreed to be her friend. Shut your mouth and drink! I'm funny, huh? You know what? It's my birthday today. It's over before you know it. What's this? For your birthday. It's nothing much. I made it out of a bullet in the military. Try it on. - So pretty. - It fits well. Don't you have anything for her? No, it's okay.

Wait! My souvenir bag! I gotta go get it! No way! The report says that they're at the beach. Comb the beach thoroughly. When you have them in sight, you know what to do. - Move out! - Move out! You should go now. You think we can meet again? Captain! Captain! We have to go now. Na-ra, wanna be my friend? When we meet again, we're friends. What is this, a soap opera? We're running out of time. Hop in! Captain! God! Hey, my friend! Me? I won't take this off until we meet again. Let's go! Hey, it's skidding! What's wrong? Isn't that Na-ra over there? - Where? - There. Yeah, that's her! Step on it! It can't stop now. Na-ra, stay right there! She looked at us, didn't she? It's Na-ra, all right! What the... She's running again! Let's go get her! It's stopped raining. God, they're gonna find us. There's no going back now. Keep rowing! Bird to ground. Suspects are in sight, running northward. Alpha, Bravo, Charlie! Move to Area C3. I repeat. Two suspects are in sight. Na-ra! Na-ra! My pants keep falling down! - Na-ra! - Hold it right there! Wow, that's awesome. She's right there. Let's go. Captain. Look over there. She's saying goodbye to us. Bye, Na-ra! Come on, keep rowing! - Na-ra! - There are snakes here! We got her! We've accomplished an impossible mission! - Hail the nation! - All hail! Where'd you get that ring? Never seen it before. Is this expensive? This? Priceless. It's one of a kind. Damn, it must be expensive. Chief, they're nowhere to be seen. Hit it. We'll go back to Seoul and... We'll report them missing. Yes, sir. Are we back in South Korea? Shut up! You're gonna jinx it.
