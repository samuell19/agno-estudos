I'm ready. I'm sitting buckled up... Calm. We're on the runway. The pilot... gets clearance from the tower. I'm sitting in the back, making sure I'm breathing properly. We're going fast. Really fast. We're nearing the end of the runway. Any second now, the plane will leave the ground and we'll be in the air... Ignore it, Yigal. Go on. OK. Where was I? Almost at the end of the runway... Maybe it's important. They'll call again later. You're right. Excuse me, Sergio. Excuse me. Hello, Sima. What? No, I'm just... taking a short break. What's up? Sure. The music room? At six. Sure thing. Bye. Bye. Lucky thing I answered. It was Sima. The kid has a parent-teacher night at school. I almost forgot. I talked with my nephew. We can do it next week. Isn't it too soon? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disrupt you. It's OK. I'm Assaf's father. Assaf Ya'akobi. Assaf Ya'akobi. Yes, they were here already. I'm sorry. I'm a little late. Got stuck at work. I talked with yourwife. We decided that... You know what it is about, right? Sure, I... he... He doesn't show up for music class. - Why not? I don't know. We just... thank you. In order not to fail him, we decided he'Iljoin the choir. Choir? That's an excellent idea. Am I holding you up? - No, but... my bus... - Sure thing, sure thing. Excuse me. - Anything wrong? - I forgot my keys in the classroom. I already locked it. - I'm sorry... You know how it is. The mind wanders sometimes. Was that your bus? I'm sorry. Can I take you somewhere? Joe Dassin. - Huh? It's Joe Dassin. I know. - You do? Nobody knows him in Israel, except for Moroccans. Are you Moroccan? No. What you played in class was really nice. Sorry I barged in. Really. Very nice. - Thank you. Is it something well-known? - A bit. It was nice. Touching, even. Right here, yes. - Here? - Here is good. Thank you. - My pleasure. I hope you sort out everything... that should be sorted out. Thank you. By the way, I'm Yigal. I didn't introduce myself earlier. Nice to meet you. I'm Lina. Good night, Lina. - Good night. What's wrong with the choir? - It's a drag, and the Russian is nuts. Assafi, the Russian isn't nuts. - She is. Even her husband left her. He took the Immigration Benefits and ran off to America. - Who did? The Russian's husband. 'Coz she's nuts. - He really ran off? Gershon, get me out of this choir. - Enough, Assafi. You must take responsibility, youractions have consequences. You're joining the choir. Period. - But Gershon... - No buts. You know Pessach from the bank, right? I met him today. His sister is married to Trabelsi. Who's Trabelsi? - The Mercedes importer. You want an egg, honey? - Yes. Pessach is getting us a meeting. You're talking about a NEW bus?! - Two. Atourcompany needs two at least. But I'll neverget to tennis on time by bus. - What's the problem? Someone has to take him to tennis from the choir. I can do it. - Dad, stay out of this. - Can you, with the cab? I'll work it out. - Great. Yourdad will take you. Why doesn't he sing? - I don't know. He won't talk to me. You and yourwife should talk to him. Dad, tennis. Sure, I'll talk to him. OK, I have to... What's this? It's for you. - For me? Adisk by Joe Dassin. The performance in Olympia. Thanks, but I cannot accept gifts from parents. It's not a gift. Well, it is a gift, but a small one. I'm divorced. You said "you and yourwife." Sima and I are divorced. I'm sorry. I didn't know. - It's OK. It's been years... You get used to it. Life doesn't end... You'll see. What? - I'm saying one gets used to it. You think I'm... You're not? I thought so, because the kids talk... And what do the kids say? Rubbish. - What, for instance? That your husband ran away to America. What, he didn't run away? - No, he's in Canada. And he didn't run away. At least, I hope he didn't. We plan to move there. He went ahead, for his Canadian license exams. He is a doctor. A urologist. Cool. Yigal, you see your problem as a handicap. Because it handicaps me. I can't fly. But it's a mistake. Anxiety is a problem, not a handicap. With the problem we're dealing. You want to fly to yourson's Bar-Mitzvah in Paris? You will. Sergio, I'm sexually attracted to Assaf's music teacher. And I guess she's... - Beautiful. Very, very much. So you are sexually attracted to a very beautiful woman, as we all are... - But I'm not sure it's right. Because she's Assaf's teacher? - Why? Is it wrong to be attracted to teachers? It's fine. You're the one who said... No, she's married. To a doctor. A urologist. I guess being attracted to a very beautiful woman, even one married to a urologist, is not only fine, but perfectly natural. You think so? - I'm positive. You want to tell me a little more about it? No. Hi. - Hello. How are you? - Fine, and you? Are you enjoying yourself? - A lot. It's really nice, the... Some sugar? - Thanks. How's the Canada thing going? - Just fine. More? My husband passed the first license exam. That's great. More? I like it sweet. - I think it's sugar you like. Let's put some coffee in yoursugar. Is there any left for you? - Not much. Ever been to Canada? - No. I didn't get the chance. - Me neither. They say it's very beautiful there. - Really? But cold. In winter it gets to -20, or-30 degrees Celsius. Minus 30? Your husband is dead set on Canada? - Yes. I can have a word with him, if you like. - It's fine. I'll take a lot of sweaters. You know, Assaf still doesn't sing. - Really? I'll have a word with him. I don't know why he doesn't sing. He just doesn't. No, he didn't cut class. He doesn't sing. So you'll have a word with him? Wait a minute, Gershon. I'm dropping off a passenger. Here's good for you? - Yes, that's the place. 98.70. - I'm such an idiot. What? - I don't have any shekels. Will you take dollars? No, what... You don't have anything? No, just a few bucks. Give me a sec. I'll get money from my wife. Keep the meter running. I'll be right back. - OK, but do it fast. I'm in a bit of a hurry, OK? - No problem. Anyway... You're still there? He doesn't have any shekels. He went to get some from his wife. What will I do with dollars? What about Tata? What's wrong with an Indian bus? Sure it's no Mercedes, but it doesn't cost like a Mercedes does. What? Cut it out, Gershon. He'll be right back. Gershon, lay off about that now. Don't talk nonsense, his suitcase is here... OK. He will come back. He will. OK. Here he comes. Wait a minute... Thank you very much. Do you need a receipt? OK. Here it is. Have a nice day. See? He even tipped me. OK. You always think the worst about people. Everything's set. How are you doing, Yigal? Awesome. Shall we go? Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. Roger. Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. Clearance fortakeoff and laps? Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. Wait a minute. Roger, Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. Waiting. Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. You have clearance to take off. Roger, Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. Have clearance to take off. We got clearance. Just a second. - What? - The belt. Is everything fine? - Sure... the belt... - It's too tight? Yigal? Where are you going, Yigal? Yigal! Yigal! Hi. 7 Livorno St. Please, then to Balfour... uh, Lin? - 79. - 79. Tolya, the bag. - 38, Galya. What 38? - What bag? Where is the bag? - I have it. Everything's fine. Where's my telephone? - I don't know. Hello. - Hi. - What a surprise. It's a small world. - Very small. You know each other? - Yigal is the fatherof a student. These are my friends, Galya and Tolya. Tolya is me. Nice to meet you. - Hi. You know Natalie, right? She's in the choirwith Assaf. Oh, yeah? Hi, Natalie. She's grumpy about the dress we picked. - You picked. But she can't wear jeans to the tryouts. What tryouts? - The Young Rubinstein competition. Acompetition for young pianists. - No kidding... Hello. I'm sorry, we forgot the phone. Who did I reach? Yes, thank you. Thank you, thank you. I'll tell her. I will. Thank you. Bye. You forgot it at work. Damn it... When will you be there? - On Thursday. Candy anyone? Tolya is on a diet. Thanks. Joe Dassin was a huge star in Russia. - You don't say. I went to his concert in Moscow when I was little. - You're so lucky! Did he evercome to Israel? - No. Do you speak French? Not a single word? - Nothing. But I like the sound of it. - Me too. Ever been to Paris? - Didn't get the chance. And you? - Me neither. Perhaps some day... - Me too. I'm working on it. - What do you mean? - It's a long story. Want us to pick up yourcell phone from work? - No, it's fine. The school is 5 minutes from here. - No, it's in Tel-Aviv. I worked at the opera in the morning. - The opera? Wow. Tel-Aviv is no big deal. We can go there. - No way. Thanks. Are you sure? - I'm sure. That's a pity. We can be there in 15 minutes. Have it yourway. 10 minutes, not even 15. It's 15 minutes in rush hour. But have it yourway. We can be there in an hourand a half tops. You got it? - I got it. It's really nice. - Yes. Is it a well-known piece? - Yes, a bit. Who's leading? I'm getting my ass kicked here. What's up? - Just fine. And you? Awesome. - I have something for you. For me? - Yes. Just a little thing. A CD. Actually, it's just one piece. Thanks. You didn't have to. - I know. Ljust wanted to. Is it well-known? - Not really. It's... something I recorded... Never mind, many years ago. Really? You recorded CDs? - A CD. Well, one composition. Thanks. Thanks a lot. It's great. It's some music Lina recorded. - Is it something well-known? Yeah. You like it? - It's alright. Tell me, in the choir... What? You don't sing? No, I don't sing. OK, don't sing. You don't have to. I already know that. OK. OK. Gershon says I have to sing. Let Gershon sing. "Yigal and Gershon Tours." It's not a good name. "Y. G. Tours". - "Y. Not G. Tours". "Why Not Tours". - That's... that's not bad. It feels right, Yigalovich. I'm telling you, that's ourticket, Yigalovich. This will be the first one and the minibuses will follow. Let Gershon sing? - What? Is that what you tell the kid? "Let Gershon sing?" He doesn't want to sing. - He will sing. Even if he doesn't want to. Are you wearing cologne? No. Wait, Sergio... Are you sure? Isn't it a little cloudy? OK. I'll meet you there. Sorry. It's just something I have to do today... Never mind. Is everything alright? - Yes. Why? I don't know. You're a little bit weird today. No, it's just... It's this thing I have to do today... What? Tell me... Do you have plans for lateron? - No. I work until 16:00 and that's it. Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. Clearance fortakeoff and laps? Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. Wait a minute. Roger, Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. Waiting. Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. You have clearance to take off. Roger, Bravo, Sierra, X-ray. Have clearance to take off. We have clearance. You can open youreyes now. Is that Bat-Yam overthere? Well, Yigal, how are you holding up? There's no coffee. Are you sure it was only 20 seconds? Maybe a little more. It doesn't matter how many. You made it. Almost. - More than almost. You just shouldn't look out the window. This was left over from New Year's Eve. We have a reason to celebrate, don't we? When we landed, I felt so... What? Horrible. Sick. But also good. I felt good. I haven't felt this good in years. It helped, having you with me. Not being alone, I mean. I'm sorry. - It's alright. Because I wasn't good enough. And because I wasn't eagerenough. One cannot have a career in music if one doesn't really want to. And I didn't. I wanted to work with children. Yes, children... it's nice... Children is nice. So why... Sorry for prying, but why... Why don't we have children? - Yes. We married young. I was just a kid. How old were you? Eighteen. Grisha didn't want children, the entire time. He always said we have time. Then we came here... In short, we missed it. - What about now? I'm too old. - Rubbish. How old are you? Yigal! Be a gentleman. Sorry. When Assafi was born, I was... I think it was the best period of my life. But then... Look, a mouse. Where? - I don't know. It was there. It can't be. We don't have mice here. But I saw it. I think. - Gross! Why is it gross? Maybe it's cute. - Cute?! So why did you jump? Do something. What can I do? It might bite me. They bite? - Some of them, perhaps. It's the rescue team. Is it Wednesday? Yes. I think so. You didn't answerthe phone. Are you alright? This is Yigal. His son is in the choir, with Natalie... We know each other. We've already met. Hello. - Hello. It's Galya's birthday. - Nice of you to remember. - Congratulations. And I won't ask how old you are. - Now that's a gentleman. Well? Are you going like this? Two minutes. - Tolya's waiting for us. You're coming with us. - Where to? To a Russian restaurant. It's karaoke night. Did you do that before? - No, but... It's a little late, and I'm not dressed for... I'll give you something of Grisha's. Did I overdo it? You're beautiful. And make sure Natalie practices at home. He's cute. Ataxi driver, huh? I'm talking about Natalie. - OK. 3 hours a day. - At least. So, you're friends? - What do you want? - I'm just curious. Yes, we're friends. - And how is Grisha? Stop bugging me. If this wasn't your birthday... - But it is. Are you having fun? - It's awesome. Do you want to sing karaoke? Never. Just follow me. - I'll let you do the singing. The riverflows and fades into the mist The riverflows and drags me with it I have many suitors But I don't have a true love. It's a Russian song. - Is it my turn now? The falling leaves are silent Across the fields... I don't rememberthis part... Does she still walk in the meadows? Does she still remember the nights of love? Does she still? Once more. In Hebrew you sing it twice. Does she still remember the nights of love? The guys and the girls are fast asleep... Somewhere a star... What are you guys laughing about? Does she stillstand by the road? Does she still remember the nights of love? Surprise. Surprise... - What, are you drunk? Hi. The jacket. This is Gregory. Grisha. My husband. This is Yigal. The fatherof a kid. He is a student of mine... I mean, the kid is. And the shirt... Next time, I'II... Good night, Yigal. Good morning. Are you alive? Here, have some... Mustache. Coffee in bed? There's no coffee. Tea? Is the place downstairs open now? Tell me, that "dad" yesterday... Should I be worried? Are you crazy? Crazy about you. It tickles. Back then, at school, there was a picture on the wall in which the farmer tilled the ground And in the back were cypress trees... Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hello, how are you? - Fine. And you? - Fine, fine. Goodbye. - See you. I saw you called me the day before yesterday. Ljust wanted to know what's going on with you. Everything's fine. - Great. I should give you back the shirt... - There's no hurry. So what now? I mean... Are you leaving, or? We're waiting fora reply from the consulate. If we get the immigration permit, we will. I really had fun at the karaoke and everything... Me too. Assaf... OK, I'm off to tennis. And the shirt... - There's no hurry. Gershon says that if I don't sing, he'll cancel the trip to Paris. He's bluffing, he won't cancel. - You sure? Much better. Your left hand is still heavy. Do you want a break? Five minutes. No more than that. Well? - She's almost ready. It's in less than a week. She must practice all the time. - We will. So tell me... - What? What do you mean, what? What about Grisha? What about him? - You know. He's grown a mustache. - You don't say! Darkness envelopes my home and the silence of the depths of the sea Yourmajesty, my lady have you come to me? The lighting here is weak The roof is leaking Yourmajesty, my lady how did you find the courage to come here? Yourappearance is like a flame There is much smoke and it is hard to breathe Come... Come, please enter Why are you standing in the doorway? Who are you... - Who are you? Where did you come from? I'm so silly Youjust came to the wrong door the wrong city, street and century. I can't wait like everyone else! They won't let me take the exam before I'll get this answer. OK, I'm sorry. How long do I have to wait? How long? How long must we go on sitting here? God... I can't study. Nothing gets into my head. Such torture... Is there a trash can around here?! Lin, why aren't you talking? What is there to say? - Nothing. You were silent back there too. As if it's only for me. - Don't take it out on me. - I'm not. I'm going crazy here, and you don't care. - I care, but why get hysterical? - I'm hysterical?! - Atrash can. What? - Your mustache. What about the mustache? What about it?! It bounces... when you get mad. Yes. How are you? No, there is no hurry about the shirt. The lawyerdoesn't have any news yet. Yes... Yigal, I'll talk to you later, OK? Yes. Thanks. Bye. Lin... I'm sorry about today. I'm sorry too. I didn't mean... Who is that? Sounds familiar. - Joe Dassin. Right. Where do we have it from? - Yigal brought it. Has anything arrived? - No. I talked to Tolya. They need people at his firm. So forthe time being, maybe I... We'll see. OK. Will you come home late today? - Yes, Natalie has the tryouts and I have to work afterwards. I'll wait up. Am I late? - You're not late. Calm down. Are you nervous? - A little. - I didn't sleep all night. You're crazy. - You're so beautiful in this dress. And you didn't want it. OK. Don't be nervous. Take some deep breaths before you begin. Don't rush. And pay attention to your left hand. And think. - And smile. Natalie Braginsky, please. - Here, here. No smoking in here. It was very nice. I hope you will try again next year. Never mind, darling. Next yearwe will succeed. What, the left hand? - No. - Did you hurry? - No. Mom, I'm hungry. - Let's go home. Can we go to McDonald's? - Today we can. Just a minute. Were you nervous? - No. So what was it? - I don't know. - Lin... Calm down. Everything's OK. - I want to understand... Weren't you thinking? Didn't you concentrate? What? I played just like at home. Even better. Can we go now? Ljust don't understand. - Lin, calm down. Never mind. Why? - Because nothing happened. - Did she pass? - No, but... So something did happen. What was it? - Nothing happened. If nothing had happened, you be accepted. - Enough, Lin! Goodbye. Hello. - Hi. I had a ride in the area. I knew you're at work. I wanted to return the... Why did we come here? You wanted to go fora ride, so... we took a ride. Do you come here a lot? - No. Occasionally. I have to go back. We got a reply from Canada. Are you going? Move over. Why? This is my side. Since when do we have sides in bed? Since you left. Grisha... You want some tea? Champagne. We don't have Champagne. Grisha! Are you crazy? It's 2:00 AM. You'll wake the neighbors. So I'll wake them. Have you seen my cigarettes? - They're on the table. It really is 2:00 AM. Where were you so late? I was with Yigal. With Yigal? So you two have some kind of... a romance? Where were you? I was worried sick. I'm flying next Thursday. Here's yourticket. They have this rule; Forthe immigration to be valid, both spouses must cross the border. OK. Grish... Something is different about... Did you get a haircut? Mustache. How are you? Are you going to Canada? -Yes. Have you told my father? Sort of. Hi, Assafi. Hello. -How are you? They're going to Canada. What, didn't you tell Yigal? How is it pronounced, Yigal or Yigaal? -Yigal. We're going to Canada next week, Yigal. Farewell to Israel. Our friends are throwing us a going-away party, on the beach. It's on Wednesday night. Maybe you'll come? Come, Grish. -I'm sorry, we have to go. We have so many things to do. Preparations. Maybe you need a ride somewhere? -No, thank you. Sure, if you don't mind. Thanks. It's hot today... -Grisha... What? Don't you want to go in an air-conditioned car? I do, but I don't want to trouble Yigal. It's no trouble at all. We'll drop Assaf off at the tennis court and... You see? It's no trouble. Yigal, What do you have to do in order to be a taxi driver? You have to have a taxi driving license. A special license? Is there a school for this kind of thing? A school for taxi drivers? No. So you have to study on your own for this? There's a Ministry of Transportation course. A course? What do you learn there, in that course? All sorts of things. Mechanics... preventive driving, car maintenance, English... English? It sounds interesting. Why are you making fun of me? I'm not making fun. I'm just... I just have a friend in Vancouver. I Wanted to tell him... how it is in Israel. When We sit here, it's alright. I can control the thoughts. I can say I can. Sure I can. Nothing's wrong here. A comfortable couch, it's quiet and pleasant. The air-conditioning is just right. There is no reason for anxiety. Except for the lady's eyes, maybe. She's got some look... We're practicing, Yigal. That's What we're doing. We're getting you ready. -It's 5 hours to Paris, Sergio. Not 20 seconds. -It's only 5 hours. It's shorter on the Way back. Ever been to Canada, Sergio? Yes. A long time ago. How is it there? -Beautiful. But it was cold. It's not for me, the cold. I'm a man of summer. She's going to Canada? I'm off, Sergio. Don't take it personally. I'm not in the mood today. What's wrong, Yigal? -I'm tired. Don't feel like it. Next week as usual? Thursday is our big day. So please take care of your voices. I Won't be here next year. I'm leaving. So our performance in the ceremony Will also be a parting from me. One more rehearsal and We'll go home, OK? You want to eat something? -No. Thank you. -Are you sure? Is everything alright? -Sure. OK. I'm seeing a psychologist. For my fear of flying. Really? Great. That's great, Yigal. I'm proud of you. I'm really proud of you. I want to come with you to Paris. -So you will. Why not? Why did you leave me, Sima? Where did this come from? I don't know. So Why? You know why. We went over it a thousand times. It didn't Work out between us. We couldn't take off. Why? Because of me? -No. It's not because of you. You know that. Really? Really, it... It was because of the both of us. Yigal, what's with you, all of a sudden? -Nothing... I just want to know why you left me. Really. To understand what did I do wrong. You did nothing wrong. -I did. You wouldn't have left me otherwise. What? -Congratulations. He signed the bus deal. Signature at the end, initials next to mine. Told you I'd bring him down. You're crazy. -I know, and it's Wrong, I should have talked to you first, but it happened so fast. I ran into the guy, We argued the price and I signed. My heart Was in my throat, but I signed. Pessach from the bank is getting us great terms. We meet on Thursday. And Avner? -I told him I'm leaving at the end of the month. Initials next to mine, pal. Congratulations. Why aren't you excited? You should be excited. I'm excited. -But? What? It's too big for me. What's too big for you? -This. Signing it on the spot. Taking a loan from Pessach. It's... But we?ve talked about it for over a year, no? -Yes. -So? It's too fast. Let's think how We're going to do this. Let's not rush in. Why Wait? How long will you break your back in that cab? My back's fine. My back is just fine. Why Wait?! -Gershon, you said "one day", not "today". OK. Enough about that. Assaf, are you hungry? I'll Warm up something for us. Yigal? Sorry, Gershon. You should have talked to me first. -We talked for a year! -Yes... We toyed With the idea... -Toyed? Yes, we toyed. What's wrong with it? -You're a real shit, Yigal! -Gershon! You're a cowardly little shit. And a shit! -Gershon! Gershon... -A miserable little shit! Fuck you, Gershon! You and your damn busses... Where to? -Tel-Aviv. 7 Bardichevski St. You know the place? -I know the place. 99.70... You have cash, right? -Sure. What? How silly of me. I don't have shekels, only... Dollars? Yes, but I don't have enough. Maybe you want to get some money from your wife? Yes, give me a sec. I'll go up and get some money from my wife. Go on then. Get the money from your wife. Take your suitcase. Maybe there's something important inside. Yes, there are important things inside... Back then, at school, there was a picture on the wall in which the farmer tilled the ground And in the back were cypress trees... Is that it? They're going? It's a bummer, huh? "Bummer" would have been good now. I heard you're thinking about coming to Paris. I thought about it, Assaf, but I'm not sure... It would be nice if you came. What will I do there with those two? The hooves of the firtree hang and tremble Birds are worriedly chirping You're living in a wild, enchanted forest from which it is impossible to get out Let the oleanderbe dried in the winds, like laundry Let the violets be washed in the rain Eitherway, I will take you from here to a castle where a flute melody is heard. Lin! Come here, Lin! I love you, Lina. I want you to stay. Grisha! Apologize. - He should apologize first. Apologize. - Him first. Apologize! My "sincere apologies", brother... Grish. Wake up, Grish. We're here. I'm going home. Say yourfarewells. (c) 2008 2-Team Productions (2004), Ltd.
