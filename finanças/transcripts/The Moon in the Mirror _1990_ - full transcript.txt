Let's pray. Oh Lord of mercy who restores Our strength with this sacrament of the Eucharis... "The Moon in the Mirror" This is our request to You who lives. And prevails over all to the end of times. The Lord be with you And may the blessing from the might God, the Father... the Son and the Holy Ghost Come down on all of you. We can now leave, In his peace and joy. The service is now finished. Come and have a look. Come on, madam. I'm starving! Fatty! He went to the stadium - Yes, on Sunday. Which team do you like best? Wanders. I am also a Wanders fan. Stop it here, mate. Stop it slowly. What's the matter with my medicine? Its coming, Dad. Get out of my way, old crap! Guess what happened again. The Bagamondes did it again. Please pass me my bag... that one. They didn't pay us for the cake, you know. How shall I buy the medicine? Don't worry. I bought it with my own money. Is that okay? How is your dad? Pussy, Pussy... Don't forget the leftovers for my kittens. Take the cigarettes and keep 'em. The weather was so beautiful today! The sea had a nice blue color. I think that he won't say a thing. If I treat you to dinner tonight. He gets very happy when you prepare those delicacies. Did you take the communion? No, I did not observe fasting. What about my medicine? What happened? There's still 10 minutes to go. This Taiwan rubbish works at its leisure. Nothing like the old watches. Those were real watches. Always on time. They never went wrong. Never. The medicine you asked me to buy. I jotted the name down on a piece of paper. Yes, but I forgot it at home. So, I bought parsley instead. They say its very good for what you have. They say it is... Natural. Does it have a crossword? - I don't know. No crossword, no good! What can I do without my diuretic? I was rubbing you. You could've left it for later. Don't you think so? You should have gone to meet her. Imagine leaving you alone... With those heavy bags! Nowadays people have forgotten what courtesy is like. He is very nice to me, a real gentleman. He's taken after his mother's family. You only have to look at him. I better carry on with the crossword. Can you help me with these things? He looks healthy. He has rosy cheeks. Come with me, please. What do we do with the parsley? How awful! End of dative case in medieval Russian. Crosswords are getting tougher every day. Not like before. They were amusing and easy to deal with. Look at these modern things. Who will know this one? Part of an aircraft wing that can be moved at take-off. I don't know. - Nor do I Like I was saying: Those modern things! Aircraft? Who cares about aircraft? The pilots believe they are... Here are the leftovers. Would you mind putting them inside a paper bag? Do you know that the recipe says that? The onions should not be fried, but cooked. I could feel proud of the navy. Which is more ancient that aviation. It started with Noah's Ark. I'll use it in the abalone pies. Dad won't like it. One day... - I won't throw it away. I'll have a photo take on the pier with the seagulls. Do abalone pies have raisins? When shall you give me my diuretic? If you wish, I'll go with you. Please don't bother. I'll go down with you. Stay here. I can see you are tired. Didn't you sleep well? River in Manchuria, 2 letters. What could it be? Ru... Rufu... No! Is it all right like this? Do you hear that? He keeps an eye on me all the time. He even slept in my living room, To keep a 24-hour-a-day watch. As if I were a rare animal. With no sight onto the sea where I spent most of my life. Look at that. Who can stand those wall and those bricks! And behind them is the Pacific Ocean! Do you fancy one? - Thank you. What sort of rubbish are you giving her? Looks like Coca-Cola. No rubbish will ever be served in my house. And less so to a lady who has been so kind. I have a very special sherry for the great occasions. Go to the cloak room and look inside the 2nd drawer... Well, Don Arnaldo, you know... Don't flatter me. Where are the keys? Maybe I have been robbed. They are here, Dad. Are those the ones? You are a very able woman. Could you take this boy to look for my sherry? Where is the cloakroom? I told you where it was. Over there. What are you looking at? Where did you buy the abalones? In the market. You shouldn't have done that. If you want good... Abalones, go to the Almendrai, to Don Floridor's - He isn't there any more. He sells them fresh. - That's where she bought them. Then Don Floridor wasn't there. These abalones are rotten, yes, sir! Rotten! He would never sell those. And the paste of these pies Has a funny taste. I'd say they're raw. Do you think so? - What did you say? They look all right to me. They're awful! And its odd Because that boy is a good cook. I got the recipe from a magazine. A very nice magazine. Nonsense! Nobody ever takes recipes from magazines. This is a traditional dish. A real lady is born knowing how to make them. The abalone pies I had in my day! At the naval Club, In that dining room with that dark Wooden skirting. So... British! So elegant! If had a telephone, I'd personally ring 'Ã©m up. And ask 'em to send us some pies. You would see what good stuff is all about. If you want... But you have me locked up in this apartment. And you have no telephone. I find this apartment very nice. You brought me here by force. - That is not true. You could have bought one in the building opposite. Those facing the sea cost twice as much. I haven't finished. I am entitled to a loan. If you were more diligent... I suffocate here. And I led such a healthy life! No smoking as many fools do around here. We barely manage to pay our debt for this one. Pensions are very low. They'll have to increase them if they want the Navy... To support the government. Why do they need the Navy? - What sort of question! Haven't you heard of the Battle of Iqulque, Arturo Prat, the Esmeralda, Condell? Which school did you go to? The Navy is an incubator for heroes. That's what youngsters need: Stamina. The previous government had no heroes. The Navy heroes are heroic heroes. That's why I need a piece of sea. If only to allow me to go on living. Please, Dad! What has Lucrezia to do with that? I don't care! That's it! You criticize me like the communists do. I've just discovered the truth. That's what you are. A communist! I've never been one. - Why did they fire you? They fired all the communists. - I've never been one. You laugh at my fondness of the Navy. Just imagine, my son affiliated with those rascals! The son of a hero like me! Hero for what? - All seamen are heroes. And don't give me boiled eggs! I want them fried. Whatever these doctors say. All rascals! Fried eggs, d'you hear? Fried! I just remembered I promised Laurita to play a hand of rummy with her. I must go. Forgive me, my father got a bit excited. Take a few of these pies if you want. Of course not. Good night, Don Arnaldo. Thank you for the invitation. I'll go with you. - Stay here to look after him. She was very dutiful. A good houswife. So much in love with her husband. She lived in a nice town near New York. He wasn't called up because he had two daughters. Both blondes with blue eyes; Jennifer and Shirley. Isn't that the name of your daughter? No, Jacqueline. But let me tell you the film. He is handsome, tall, dark-haired, as most American actors are, and the two girls were flirting. Shirley with a freckled-faced guy I don't like freckled-faced ones. And Jennifer with a blond and he also had blue eyes... and a car. They used to go out flirting and she was accused by a neighbour who wrote her father-now a soldier- Telling him her daughter was disgracing the family by going out with a guy with a car. What's wrong with that? I'd love to have a car. Thats just a film. Then when he comes back, its very sad because he has lost one leg. And his beautiful wife is waiting on the pier with all those sea gulls flying around. When he comes down the gangplank, She realises he's an invalid. She covers her face like this. The mayonnaise will go sour. When he sees her reaction, He thinks he is going to be a nuisance in her life. But she reacts and call him out and Despite his crutches, She runs towards him and they embrace and kiss. Why did you do that? Needs more salt. There is no need to cry, Lucrezia. But I feel so sad! Why do you feel sad? I don't know. Everything makes me feel sad. Also Jaqueline worries me. Anything wrong with her? Tell me. Tell me all about your sorrows. She's splitting up with her husband. She never gives a damn. As if she were ashamed of me. How can you say that? Its true. Maybe its just an impression. But that's not the worst of it. The worst is that... Tell me... tell me. She doesn't know what to do with her daughters. Until she sorts out her problems, With my granddaughters, I didnt want to tell you about them... I thought you'd figure I was old... And you wouldn't... Don't say that! You are not that old. Hug me. Please, hug me. Not here, someone could see us. There aren't any mirrors here. Can I give you a small caress? Go ahead but just gentle. Let us respect the dead. Who is dead? - My husband. My dear darling... Don't you see? Don't laugh, Fatty! As it sounds, dear Fatty. A little closer... "Such a long time not seeing eachother." Her tenderness was exceptional. Your mother's affection was something. Listen to what she said: "Such a long time without seeing each other" "To me the harbour seems empty without you" Not this one, Fatty: "empty without you" Is it all right, Dad? "I remember how handsome you were in your uniform" "standing at the corner of Victoria Square" "Now I'll go out with my cousins" "Which is like being alone." "When are you coming back?" Be careful! A little further over there... A little more... that's it. It can be seen from here. When are you coming back? It seems an eternity after... how many days... After 15-18 days have passed. Don't break the leg of that table. Will she have fine furniture? Whats the name of that woman you bring over here? Which woman? - Oh, come on! That one who dyes her hair the colour of carrots. Oh, dear Lucrezia. D'you think she could write letters like these? And her furniture, huh? I guess she has ordinary stuff. I haven't noticed them. Don't give me that. Your mother always had someone looking after her. We never were alone before marrying. Not us either. No, your mother was a queen, a saint. Not like that woman, there's no comparison. We haven't that much. - Where are you? The price of the hillside apartments have gone up. And that furniture isn't credit store rubbish. Definitely not. She wouldn't pass the test. Which test? - For your information... The Navy checks on the officers' fiancees. They look into their family, connections, Social relations, political ideas. They must be crystal clear ..immaculate. With nothing that casts A doubt on the morals or leads into Anything which does not meet an officer's ideal. Can you see all right now? She's going to have a nice surprise. She aint fooling me. I saw her taking you to the kitchen. I know she brings in those records. To get you into her web And teach you to laugh at me. Tell her to dye her hair like a beetroot. She would look more like a lady. I will ask them to run a thorough check on her. What do you think? Are you awake? I am feeling very bad. Be very patient with me, dear son. Very patient. I fear Dr. Mardones will come tomorrow. And won't tell me anything. Looks like a punishment from God. Why? Listen! What would I do without you dear son? If you go away with that woman, Something could happen and I'd be left alone. A Sagittarius like you would get better results if she wanted. Do you hear that noise? How can't you hear it? There are rats everywhere. Rats make me sick. There aren't any rats. For you, dear friend. If you take some holidays, And forget about your work, you will feel better. You may receive a letter from that person you care for. Remember your day is Friday. Your lucky number is five. Lucrezia went out. Don't you worry. She always leaves her door open. I don't know where she goes. I hardly go out, you know. You can leave the gas bottle over there. If you want to leave her a message. I'll relay it to her later on. No problem in doing that for you. Excuse me, whats your name? Neighbour. Lunching next to the sea. And now you, Patricia. Dear friends, I have a nice surprise for all of your. A nice big surprise. A Xmas cake for this very special week. A Xmas cake that comes from Hollywood. Its recipe belongs to Norma Shearer who is... A great film star but also a good mother and wife. Well, there goes the recipe. This mixer contains 3 full cups of flour, Two of icing sugar, A bit of yeast for salted water And a few drops Just a few drops of citron blossom essence. Where am I going to get citron essence? Lucrezia, where were you? If you make 12 of those cakes at 200 pesos each, I don't think that's cheap. I won't sell them. It's too much work, Fatty. But I'd earn 2,400 pesos! What about my share? I'll spend the money on a nice present for you. A very nice present for Xmas. Presents are presents, I don't need to know How you get the money. And I want to buy some too. For whom? Tell me, for whom? A mould neither too large nor too small. Play that record again and don't scratch it. Its a very special recording of Telefunken. The Uberkuchen Singing Boys. Please help him, Lucrezia. He has such shaky hands. You forgot something. The manger. - He is right. We are celebrating the birth of our Lord. People nowadays celebrate Xmas in such heretical ways. All these presents and such silliness. When what we are celebrating is the birth of our Lord, the Son of God. This is the day of the family, of love. I'm not saying that people should not enjoy themselves. But they should do so in a more healthy way. As I did in my days. Listen to that. That half-crazy girl is always playing it. Really? And do you know her? Wonderful! Come over here. What's the matter? Come and see this! Hurry up! Run! What is it? The moon is reflected in the mirror. Where? - Here, here. Come closer! Now, look. You too, son! Look! "Moon, moon bringing over fortune." "Moon, moon bringing over fortune." I hope it's true. Are you happy? - Yes everything was delicious. What a nice party! I'm really enjoying it. Come over here, please. Hurry up, let's enjoy Xmas! That's an order. Right away! Lucrezia, if I was in good condition, I'd dance with you like a mad man. I would love to do that. Let's assume that I am the son and dance with him. I can't dance. - I'll teach you. That's it! Start to dance. One step this way, another the other way. One step this way, one step forward, another backward. Not that way... Jump, jump, Fatty. Move your hips like she does. Move 'em happily. Happily! I want to see people happy on Xmas. Fatty, dance like a man. Don't let her go away. Go forward. That's it! Seize her. Christmas! What are you doing with your hands? You are not dancing as you should. Turn around! Turn around! That's the way, Fatty! At long last! Seize her, Fatty! Be happy in order to face the... To face what? - The bad times. What question is that? What bad times? This year will be a success. The full moon will bring us luck. Our wishes will be fulfilled. What did you wish, Fatty? I wish you and I would have been... You are like all men. Just thinking of one thing. Are you like them? I also think about that, but... You don't understand me. You really don't. Don't feel sad. Cheer up! You'll see when your Dad Gets better things will straighten out. And you? What do you wish? What is it? Tell me about it. How can I tell you? Its a secret. She has to tell her wish. Or its not valid. Well... I feel ashamed. What about yours, Don Arnaldo? At my age there's not much I could wish. I have so few things left. But I've got one thing... one thing that you neither have nor can think about. And what is that? The rembrances of the past. You never lose that. The parties we were treated to, my Goodness! And where was that? In Mejillones. There we were respected. How nice! - Wasn't it here? Either in Mejillones or here. The aristocracy of Mejillones. They treated us to such delicious food that... We came ashore in a fast boat as there was no pier. The ladies, with their sunshades, greeted us on the beach. They waved at us with their laced handkerchiefs... When we were on parade. One night a dancing party was held in the Officer's club. Later on, we had a Ventian party. Like the ones we have here. We all went with those elegant ladies. On rowing boats along the bay. While the band was playing. And we were singing... Each lady carried a Chinese lamp. The bay was all lit up. And then came the fireworks. It was all so beautiful. We were singing while over the waves. You could hear the sirens of English, French And American ships. Sailing away... Over the waves... But there were no waves... The sea was so calm, like a cup of milk. Fatty! Fatty, come here quickly! What is it? Please help me. Come closer. I'm sorry, son. I have wet myself. I'm sorry, Lucrezia but, you'll have to go. Why? Dad has made a mess of himself. I'll have to change him. I'll help you. Tell me what to do. You must be joking. Remember: I'm one of the family. Well, then? This time you better not look, Leave that. My Dad doesn't like that. Why does your dad have so many boxes under his bed? There are letters from my mother, medals and badges. So, your father is a hero! I'm not certain, it looks like it. I think he was. With a statue too. Not here in Valparalso. Where then? In Mejillones, I guess. They come looking for a shelter from the rain. Who? Don't you hear them? Hear what? - Their feet, little feet. I don't hear a thing. Shut up! Those little feet running in the attic. Disgusting! All those old houses in Valparaiso have rats. Had you kept this one clean, there would be no rats. I'll get a cat. You want to kill me. I will die, get high fever and sneeze all the time. Oh, yes. Your allergy! You have to put poison. That Lucrezia has the smell of a cat's runoff. How disgusting! Want me to play a record? Bolivian High Plateau. What? - Four letters. What? - What did you say? Four. Four letters. I don't know. - No, no. Hydroronol. Cheer up, Don Arnaldo. I don't like to see you in that mood. Smile a bit. We're going to sell so many cakes. Look what Lucrezia has brought you. A bag of naphtaline. You should have seen the moths. Dad, we could clean the wardrobe. Its in bad need. Can we have the keys? Looks like he fell asleep. He has his little eyes open. Sometimes he sleeps like that. You see, he's asleep. He has them somewhere here. Beware, he could see us. Open it, dear Lucrezia. Do you like it? Looks like a museum. One... two... three... four... five... Your mother was pretty. She was a hard worker. Its a pity hats went out of fashion. The ladies stopped coming to have their hats made. They used to come in cars- with their drivers. She caught a kind of melancholy. She piled up all inside here. She never spoke to my father again. Nor to me. I kept looking out of the window to see To see if any of her clients were coming. None did. Afterwards, she died. How does it look on me? - You look pretty. Don't believe I'm presumptuous but at school they used to say I looked like Joan Fontaine. What do you think? Do I look like her? How silly! You never saw any film of hers. I want to see you always like that: Laughing. The two of us always laughing. Always together, like in a painting. When does your father take his medicine? In forty minutes. Do you dare? To go out. You don't know me. I have so many ideas. Sometimes... I feel my head will burst. I think about so many things! About what, tell me. I don't know. My mind has gone blank now. Things I would like to do in the future. Like opening up a restaurant. Why not? A shell fish restaurant would be full of people. With your splendid cooking, You would be a millionaire. Since the maid left, I've been cooking for Dad. And you know how grumpy he is. I had to learn to keep him happy. Do you like my idea? Will he get better one day? Do you think so? I don't know, the poor man is so old! That he has to pass away, I know. You better wrap up. Its getting cold. He has left already. By the stairs. Hurry up! I'm exhausted. - Give me your hand. My little cat! Dad? - He's asleep. Your medicine. He looks so nice while asleep. Wake up, please. Don't wake him up. We better look for the cat. He is allergic. - Where has it gone? Did you hear it? His name is not Pussy Cat It's Sultan. Sultan, I found it. Come and help me. You go over there. I'll go through here. Under the bed. Between the boxes. He likes you Dad. Where is it? - There it is. I don't see a thing. - Over there. I'll take it to your house. Yes, but don't squeeze it. I won't. What happened? - I got my hair trapped. Be still. Say good-bye to Daddy. What are you doing? How nice. Did you see them? See what? Dad doesn't want anybody to touch 'em. But they will be yours. Put them away. Come on! Come on! Shut up! Go to hell! You scared me. How does it look on me? Like a queen! There are many of them. Of course. This must be the Cross of Malta. This one is the Legion of Honor. You know a lot about these things. They all have their names engraved. Where do I put this? Anything but don't pinch it. Let me bestow this upon you. It fits nicely on you. The Queen of England has one very much like this one. Further down. - Have you seen it? Queen of England, my ass! You bloody whore! You scoundrel! Damn it! Laughing at my medals! Get out of my house! You dirty bitch! Get out, old shit! This is mine and this is mine too. Not to my Dad, no! Let me go! Let me go! Don't touch me! Don't touch me. Don't touch me! Let me go! Please don't go. Don't touch me. - Forgive me. I want to go away. Don't touch me! Don't leave me, I beg you! Wait for me. Go away! Go away! Forgive me. - Leave me alone. All I want is to marry you. You don't love me. - I love you. How d'you expect me to believe you? Look at me. Certainly not. I messed it all up. Don't touch me - Please believe me. Believe what? That I want to marry you. I swear. Why should I believe you if you raised your hand at me? Never again, dear Lucrezia. Never again. This is the limit. Forgive me, please. Nobody respects the heroes any longer. Bloody communists, whores, queers, rubbish! No respect left in this country, bloody queers! A number of little fatties... Have you ever been told how nice you are? Have you been loved? There is no noise here. A pair of fatties. We better have one. They say its dangerous to have two. I'm against bringing up children in apartments. What's the point of having one next to the sea? I would like to move over to Renaca. To those lovely houses with the little gardens. We could sell these two. And move over. The child could play on the beach. We could do an auction before we go. If your Dad doesn't agree, we stay, but... He will have to move to the room at the back. And we take the main bedroom. Afer all, we are the owners. If we could apply a coat of paint, it would look nice. Don't you think so? The secret is to wait for the release of the aromas. You have to be patient and choose the right moment. Pick up the right time to add a condiment. Or increase the strength of the fire. You get used to it, dear Lucrezia. You get used to waiting and looking, To feel rain when its time when everything is right. Fasten my shoelaces. The best is the maceration of meats, Leave them to pickle until they are tender. There is nothing more tasty, Than a well macerated piece of meat. Sometimes, dear Lucrezia, You don't need to use a knife to cut it. You do it with a fork. But you have to wait for Nature to do its work, That the wine and the species, Turn the meat soft and ready. Where are you going? To the parade and then to the Venetian sailing. A boat will pick me up at the foot of the hill. Why did you interfere with this? Here's the tasty stewed corn, very tasty and warm. If I go out to look for him, I won't find him. When he comes back, he'll find nobody. Who's going to look after him, to help him to bed? He has to be looked after like a child. He left without his scarf and overcoat. Without an overcoat, he will catch a cold. But I think that he'll be back soon. What do you think? Fatty, can you hear me? What happened? - Nothing. What do you mean? My Dad went out. He said he would be in the parade With all his medals. You love me, don't you? Poor man. Who? - Him. Do you want me to get up? Better not, dear Lucrezia, better not.
