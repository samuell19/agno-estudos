Sub By Ayinainsoph Based on a true story Lately, when I point a camera at her, she responds. Hisashi. How're you doing? Eat! Here. - Thanks... - It'll get burnt. Have a drink. Here you go! I've never had Samgee... It's pronounced Samgyeopsal! You butchered it. On Purpose! Samgye...l can't even say it. Come on, Hisashi. Lighten up! Inoue' s cute, huh'? I invited Haru. - Really? - Cute, right? You're both teachers? Haru's a magazine editor. Whoa! An editor! Magazine editor? You must be smart! She's a genius. Hisashi, where are you going? Be right back. Hisashi, come drink with us tonight. My friend's coming. And his friend's girlfriend's friends, too. But I'm not really... How about a drink tonight? Sorry, Hisashi and I have a party... What? There must be girls involved. That's important. Next time, then. Sorry. I can't make it. Don't touch that. Really? Bathroom? Go, then. Okay. Mr. Murota, can I go, too? You were listening? Of course. Who's coming? "Men's Restroom" This guy's a filthy rich dentist. Not really... Isn't he annoying? That guy's a steady civil servant. And we have big hearts. What? Calling the office? Hisashi is a workaholic. Never mind. He's kinda good looking, but he's boring. His job is tinkering with cars. As well as his hobby. A car nerd? No thanks. Doing what, exactly? He literally tinkers with cars all day long. Shut up. How about going to karaoke? Let's go! Sorry, but I'm out. Why? You're so boring. Let's go! Next time. Come on. Miyuki, let's go. Excuse me! Wait! What is it? It's been bugging me all night, so I'll just say it. What's wrong with your attitude? Like you didn't want to be there, and the girls were a bunch of idiots. Wait a minute... I wasn't having the best time of my life either. But it's a social mixer. No one forced you to come. But since you did, you should try to have fun. Or at least act like you are. I really... What? Nothing. I'm sorry. Huh? You think an apology will get you off the hook? No! I feel bad for killing the mood, but... But what? I'm not good in that kind of setting. I'm not passing judgment on the party or the girls. Then what was it? My stomach was hurting. Huh? Meat and alcohol made it worse. Really? Yes. That's totally understandable. Why did you apologize? You got mad at me... I see. They were joking about it, but I thought it was pretty cool. What? "Job and hobby: tinkering with cars." Thanks. I get it now. Your stomach was hurting! I'm going to karaoke. - See you! - Good night. Hey! Here. To warm your tummy. Thanks. See you. Take care! Doors are closing. Did you wait long? I just got here, too. Really? How have you been? It's been a while. It sure has. I wanted to be a cook and went to a vocational college in Kobe. Actually, I've always worked in restaurants since high school. I was taking business classes but my teacher said I was the only one who'd graduate without a license. Welcome. Can we join you? Come on! I've always wanted to come here. It's a nice place. Stop here. Excuse me. Excuse me! What are you catching? Sardinella. Wow! Sardinella. Amazing. Wanna try? Can I? Go ahead. Thank you! Come on. Huh? Huh? - Hold it! - Where?! You caught one! Pull. Pull! That's you. How did you know? You haven't changed. Watermelon! Thank you. Go ahead. Guests first. It's fine. Oh, this. It was 6th grade Sports Day. She had a fever. It was over 39°c But she didn't complain because she wanted to go. She went to Sports Day, won first place and got real sick that night. That's how she is. Kind of tough. Guess. What kind of boy were you? Me? From a few days before Sports Day, I'd be so worried that I'd catch a cold that I'd actually catch one. Same here. Is it snowing? Oh, yeah. Wow! A White Christmas. A White Christmas! Will it cover the ground? I hope so. It looks good on you. Really?! "Taiyo Motors" Good morning. Happy new year. You, too. Are you okay? Sorry. Why are you sorry? This place is a mess. "A mess"?! You shouldn't have left it here. So it's my fault? Calm down. It's good to be nice... But not too nice. Mai, um... Can I see your ring? This? The one you gave me? Yeah. Can you take it off? Okay. Thanks. It's nice out here. Hm? What's wrong? Nothing. Is this...? Let's get married. No way! You took so long to notice. Why would I notice? - Sorry... - Excuse us. Here. Every time I pass by here, I think it's so beautiful. Congratulations! Excuse me. Yes? I'd like to reserve a date. - Pardon? - Please. Of course. Let me check the calendar. Come with me. This is happening so fast. I can't believe it. I'm so happy, it's scary. What's wrong? So much has happened today... My head hurts. Are you okay? Yeah. March 17th is available. It's not an auspicious day. Do you mind? No. It's the day we met. Please mark us down. Yes. This waterfall was amazing. These noodles were delicious. What? We never ate that. I've never been there. What do you mean? I've never been to that waterfall. But... What's wrong, Mai? I said I've never been there. I don't remember. Are you okay? Does your head hurt? I've never been. I've never been there, right? I'm not crazy, am I? No! No! No! No! I'm scared! No! What's wrong, Mai? What is this?! Help me! Let's go to the hospital! Mai! Help me! You're okay. - Mai! Let gm! You idiot! - Let go! - Mai... Don't touch me. I don't want to die! You're okay. Doctor! I know I'm going to die. I know it. Kill me! Now! Let me go! Idiot! Let's go. You're okay. You'll be fine. We're almost there. We're turning. We're here. Her ring. - I'm taking off your ring. - We'll give it right back. Is your head okay? How is she? They don't know what's going on. She's sleeping now. I see... You must have been shocked. That's not our Mai in there. Yes. It can't be. It's an old car. Be careful, Masaru. Okay. This is Hisashi. What? I'll be right there. Hisashi! Please wait in the hallway. You need to get out. Apply the defib. Transfusion. Defibrillator. Charged. Stand back. She's in V-fib. Where's Mai Nakahara? Are you family? I'm her fiancé. Mai... Her heart started moving again. But she may... ...be like this forever. She may never wake up. Mai? Mai! Mai! What's wrong? Nurse! What is it? Don't worry. We're on it. Dr. Sakata! Check her vitals. Ms. Nakahara. "Get well soon!" Morning. Good morning. Did you sleep over again? I felt like she might get up in the middle of the night. A mother's intuition. I guess it's not that reliable but... Look at the time. Maybe I'll go home once. You should. Thanks for coming every morning. What about your job? This is two hours away from your apartment. I don't mind. I have my motorcycle. I see. Spring is almost here. But Mai isn't waking up. Guess. It's the 34th morning since Mai went to sleep. Mai hasn't awakened yet. We're all waiting for you, Mai. Is your girlfriend still sick? Yes. I don't know much about illnesses. It was caused by a tumor on her ovary that developed antibodies. In Mai's case, those antibodies attacked her brain cells by mistake. By mistake? It happens to one in 3 million people. It's rare. Thanks. I shouldn't compare this situation to cars, but... You remember your interview here? No... You said you liked to fix things. So I asked you what you thought about while fixing things. You said... Kind of bashfully... "Love." If you love something and never give up, it can be fixed. The most important thing is to believe it can be fixed. You were so passionate. I thought you were an oddball. Come on. Eat. May I? I send videos to Mai's phone. So she can laugh when she wakes up. Boss, give me a "V" sign. Like this? That's good. Was that cute? Not really. What the heck? Thank you. Hurry up and eat. Thanks. She looked so well. Yes. You must be worried. Yes... Have a seat. Okay, I'll cancel your reservation. Oh, no. I don't want to cancel. I'll pay, of course. If I cancel, I'll feel like I'm breaking a promise. I'm sorry. No. And... She may wake up by that date. She'd be disappointed if the date was canceled. Mai was really looking forward to it. Yes. I understand, but realistically... If she doesn't wake up by then, I'll reserve the same date next year. Please. I'll bring you a drink. Is it difficult? There's no precedent. Is it going to be a problem? But hang on. I'm doing a repair job. "Mai Nakahara" Good morning. Mai...Mai...You're okay. Mai, you're okay. - Excuse me. - Sorry. Mai. Removing her ovaries... So a surgery? Yes... It'll be fine. Don't worry. You can say that because you're not family. Right? How can you say it'll be fine? It's not fine at all. There's no guarantee it will go well. Don't say things so lightly. That's enough. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. That was harsh. I'm home. Hi, dear. Thanks for coming. It's been a while since I've been here. Hisashi. Yes? Hatsumi and I have been talking. You're free...to leave. Leave? Seeing you is hard on us. You're free to forget about Mai. Um. I promised... Mai. To marry her. I'm fine. So... Please let me stay by her side a little longer. No. You're... ...not family. I'm so glad Mai met you. I wish you were part of our family. But... This is a tragedy only family members should bear. We don't want to ruin your life, too. SO... okay? Please. Forget about Mai. What's up? No hospital today? I don't need to go today. Hey, Hisashi. Come with me. For a delivery. Okay. Here. Thank you. This is a good place for auto mechanics. What do you mean? Salt air wreaks havoc on cars. I see. There it is! This feels great! Right? Yes. Hello. Nice sound. - Thanks. - No problem. Wait! Is it time already? What's going on? A kabuki show. Kabuki? It's not authentic kabuki. The islanders put on a show. The kids get on stage, too. It's more like a festival. Why don't you join us? Good idea. What do you think? Don't rush! I suppose. Since we're here. Sure. Okay. Apologize, you brute. Come, now. That will be fine. Thank you. Sing, Sankichi. A wailing voice. The hill reflects... They're good. ...the falling rain. Bravo, Mana! Eiji! Good job, Eiji. Bravo! Hisashi. Are you all right? Mai's father told me that I'm not "family." I see. But... Mai is trying her best. I want to be there when she needs me. Go home. Boss. Thank you. Good morning. Morning. Good morning. Are you sure? Mai may never wake up. You still want to be family? Yes. I see. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm happy- So happy- The couple has arrived. Please welcome the bride and groom. Watch the candle! Congratulations. Sorry, Hisashi. - Why are you sorry? - Sorry. The groom shouldn't cry. I'm next. Don't cry, Murota. Congratulations! Congratulations, Miyuki! Good morning. Cute flowers. I picked them outside. Her condition is unchanged. Mai... Mai! Mai...Mai woke up! Can you see this? Mai! You woke up? Mai. I'm so glad. I'm so glad! Aren't you? She opened her eyes! "Reborn"? What does that mean? She's not going to pick up where she left off. What do you mean? She'll be interacting with the world from scratch. In her current state, Mai is like an infant. What? Her brain is kind of "blotchy." She won't be able to remember everything. I hope you understand. So she can never be the same as before? I couldn't say. I think she will recover, but I can't guarantee it. We'll have to wait and see. That's great news! Thank you. Hisashi! Hisashi! You're creeping me out! Thank you, though. Hisashi! That's great! Yes. Miracles do happen. Thank you. Congrats! Thank you, everyone. I'm so happy for you, Hisashi! Thank you. Congrats. Thank you! Hisashi! We couldn't wait. Sorry. No. - Look, Hisashi. - What? Mai is smiling. Mai... It's me, Hisashi. Mai. Welcome. Thank you. Excuse me. Good morning. This is a new patient, Mai Nakahara. Nice to meet you. Welcome. Hello. Okay, let's move her. 1, 2, 3. Okay. Catch. Good try. Why don't you try, Mom? Look, Mai. That's it. Almost. Let's try again. You got it. Ready, catch! Here we go, Mai. Nice! Oh, my. She's getting better. Good job. Mrs. Nakahara. Everyone dies, right? Miho. You have to think positive. Right? One more time, Mai. Good! Let's shake hands, Mai. Good. You did it! You shook hands. Sit up. Good, now extend. You can do it. Look up, Mai. Move your legs. Slowly. Take it slow, Mai. Look up. Can you move her legs, Hisashi? You can do it, Mai. Can you take a step? "Nakahara" Oh, no! Mao was beaten by Yuna Kim! I'm more upset about Asashoryu's retirement. Right, Mai? Please be careful, Ms. Maeda. Soba shops are bustling with customers on New Year's Eve. I made jello for dessert. She's eating well. - Here, Hatsumi. - Thank you. It's been 5 months since the Great East Japan Earthquake. In a commemorative festival in Miyagi, 10,000 floating lanterns... Hi...sa...shi... ...san. - Hello. - Hello. Are you cold, Mai? No. Year Six Look. Remember your roommate, Miho? She won top honors! How wonderful. "National High School Speech Contest 'The Value of a Life' by Miho Izumi" Mom? Yes? Is he coming today? Who? Hisashi. I think so. I see. Why? No reason. Why do you ask? Mai. Are you hiding something from us? You were always first. It was written all over your face. Remember the first day of school? The bathroom... "Underpants Incident"! Stop it. You never told us where you met Hisashi. Tell us! Well...um... Oh, uh... We met at a drinking party set up by a guy from my work. A BBQ place. I had a stomach ache that night. I couldn't eat or drink anything. She was so pissed off at me! That sounds like Mai. She just blows up sometimes. You never know when. It's so random. She's so serious. Thanks for coming. Thank you. Be careful. Mai. You don't remember me, do you? I thought so. Is it just me? I think so. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. I see. You say we were engaged. But... I can't remember. I thought I could ignore it but... Sorry. I didn't realize. No. It must have been hard. I see. It makes sense. But... I'll try. I'll try to remember. I promise. We ate dinner at my place on Christmas Day. Right. And we exchanged presents. While we were eating, you pulled down the tablecloth... I hope you remember. Stop. Here... This is where I'd meet Hisashi. We'd drive all over the place... The arcade where we first spoke. Hisashi became part of our family while you were sleeping. It's all out of order, isn't it? Shall we head back? Come on. Just one more place. Hisashi's apartment. We promised we'd be back in 3 hours. Next time. It is almost 8:00 pm. Visiting hours will end at 8:00 pm. Thank you for your cooperation. You drove around today? I'll try. To remember. A drinking party set up by a guy from work. I didn't eat or drink anything. She was so pissed off at me... Mai's not in her room! No. I have no idea. She went out on her own! Yes. I'll go look for her. Hello? Hisashi? She may have gone to your apartment. She wanted to go. Okay. I'll go look for her. Mai! Mai! What are you doing? It's dangerous! But I want to remember. I don't remember anything. I hate this! I hate it! My head...What's wrong? Your head? My head hurts! Ow! My head hurts! You idiot! Kill me! Now! Kill me! Mai! Thank goodness! You're okay now. Don't worry, Mai. Dad. Mom. I'm sorry. I thought I was getting better. It's okay. It's fine. Sorry. . . I'm sorry. I didn't mean to push you. No, I wanted to go. You proposed to me here. Don't push yourself anymore. Huh? When you woke up, I was so happy. I came to see you every day. But for you... You were asleep for a long time. When you woke up... ...there was a stranger who claimed to be the man you were engaged to. I'm sure you were terrified. But... You still... ...tried your best to accept me. But from now on, I want you to live your own life. Is it... because I lost my memory? You're amazing. You survived a coma. Just being here is a miracle. You don't have to suffer anymore. So... I'll stop coming to see you. Thanks. Take care. Let's go. Hey, how are you doin'? We're not fully stocked here. Don't you get bored fixing cars? I enjoy it. You're an odd bird. Maybe so. You're home. I'm home! Welcome home. I'm home. Can you manage? "Your password is incorrect" "Your password is incorrect" The right foot now. And left. And right. Open your eyes. You're recovering nicely. You'll be fine. Thank you. You can even get married and have kids. I hope you lead a happy life. Um... I thought... Your surgery? Yes. Your mom insisted that we preserve your ovaries. Look. It's so pretty. It sure is. I'm glad we found something nice. Right? I'll go get the car. Wait here. You're all better now! I'm so glad. Huh? Didn't you know? All this time? Yes. All this time. He came every year on the day and refused to cancel. Your reservation is still here. Realistically... If she doesn't wake up by then, I'll reserve the same date next year. Please. Is it difficult? There's no precedent. Seven years ago Mr. Nishizawa! I'll make it happen. Thank you! Every year, I reserved March 17th for the two of you. "Message received" "Hisashi" You should have gone with her. She'll be fine. But... She should go on her own. Right? Remember, she willed herself back from a coma. She can do this. From today, I'm going to take videos and send them to your phone. It's kind of embarrassing, filming myself but we'll laugh about it later. This is Mai. She's sleeping well. She's not waking up. I tried making Mai's pasta. What a fiasco! Is this food? But I'll eat it. Where are we today? The correct answer is... A very memorable spot for us. I'm regretting it, though. I'm surrounded by couples. This is rough. Really awkward. Will Mai remember the night sky we gazed at together? This is not a good place for a guy to come alone. I'm a little depressed today. I feel so lonely without Mai. Please wake up, Mai! That's it for today. See you tomorrow. Hisashi... Mai! I love you! Sorry. The other day, Mai had surgery to remove her ovaries. Hang in there, Mai. This is Mai's second walk. We're with your mom and dad. Mai, I'm waitin' for ya! Shodo Island was beautiful. I wish you could see it, too. Let's go someday. It's been 401 days since Mai went to sleep. And today, her respirator was removed. Now, Mai is breathing on her own. Can I help you? I'm looking for Hisashi Nishizawa. Can we play down there? Go ahead. Let's all go. Don't go too far. Okay! The swing's fixed! If it breaks again, I'll fix it. Thanks, mister! Mister, huh? See ya! Bye! I'll come! I'll come to you! So wait for me. I wanted to thank you. For waiting for me. For believing in me. And staying by my side. But... I still can't remember. But I don't care. Because... I've... fallen in love with you again. "Fallen in love again" sounds weird. I've always loved you. Let's walk together. Ready? Right foot. Left foot. Right foot. Left foot. Right foot. That's it. Right foot. Left foot. Right foot. Left foot. We'll walk together. Now and forever. I'm going to karaoke. - See you! - Good night. The 8-Year Engagement Mai will be entering with her father and mother. Here they are.
