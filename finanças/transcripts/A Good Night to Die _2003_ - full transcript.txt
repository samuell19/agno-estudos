[Silence] [August] So, this is my last day in this life. Fucked up, right? Ever since I was a boy, I dreamed about doing this shit. Some kids dream about being a ballplayer, a firefighter, some quack doctor. Fuck all that. I wanted to play in the big game, and I got there. Hey, you know what? I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning. [Tires screeching] [Rapid gunfire] [Sirens wailing] [Gunfire continues] How you doin', man? What's up, man? What you doin'? Hey, let me get some of that popcorn, man. Fuckin' grease. You got any napkins, man? Thanks, bro. You ain't got no goobers or some shit? Are you here by yourself? I don't like coming to movies by myself. It's hard to get somebody to come to the movies with you in the middle of the day, right? Everybody's got a fuckin' job. I like comin' here alone. You can do whatever you want. Whatever the fuck you want, right? Just get up... Do some fuckin' jumpin' Jacks and shit. Push-ups... Just chillin' in the movie theater, doin' some push-ups. Yo, yo, yo... If there was some girls in here, I'd be like... Aah...ooh... Yeah! Fuckin' six pack, shit like... Fuckin' drago or some shit. Damn. Yo, let me get some more of that popcorn, bro. All you. I don't even know why they call this shit butter. This shit isn't even butter-flavored. It's disgusting. You know what they put on this stuff? It's like rocket fuel. You could launch like missiles and shit. Hey, I'm Ronnie. August. How you doin'? That's a fucked-up name. It's a long story. How about you save it for another time? Yeah, I was plannin' on it. Man, you got any money? If you're hungry, you can finish off the popcorn. I said, you got any money? Careful with that knife there, son. Am I speakin' Chinese? Give me your shit. You don't understand.Eh, you don't understand, you fuck. Let me get your wallet. I'm a fuck, huh?Yeah. Listen, kid. You don't understand. Hey. Give me your money. I'm no fuckin' fool.All right, all right. And I ain't about to be partin' with my money. Okay. Are we followin', here?Okay. Put your little peanut knife away. All right.All right. Take it easy.All right. Now you wanna do a job right... [Whispers] You better have the right tool. Now what? Well, my new-found friend August, that would depend on what you want to do after the movie. [Honking] [August] I met Ronnie at a movie theater on the lower east side. I guess he saw somethin' in me, thought I'd be good at this shit. They say you reap what you sew, right? Create your own destiny and whatnot. Well, Ronnie had no idea what he was sewin'. We became best of friends, though, tight. We still are, but that was three years ago, and a lot of shit can change in three years, trust me. [Door opens] Roy boy! Where's my joy? This better be good to get me out of my bed. Where'd you buy that outfit? The fucking methadone clinic? Oh, shit. Frankie, get me a cup of coffee, huh? How you doin'? Everything's all right? You been out today? How the fuck can I be out? You woke me up when you called me. You hear anything about me? What the hell happened now? Well, i'm... [Clears throat] I'm pretty sure you could call this a fuck-up, but let me just run this by you just to make sure, all right? So, I'm doin' this job tonight. Don't ask me for who, because I'm not gonna tell you, but I did this job tonight. So a couple hours, you know, I'm in their house... I'm getting a little bumped up because, you know, sometimes I work better like that, you know? A little snow to start the fuckin' show, all right? Anyway, this guy, he owes money-- about 10 grand. It's no big deal, but it's nothin' to blow snot at, right? But he's actin' like a real prick. The guy's skippin' in and out of town like he plays for the Knicks or some shit. Fuckin' Knicks... You see that game last night? Just tell me the story. All right, so the collector decides he ain't worth the space. So he gives me a call because, you know, I'm who you call, right? Yeah, like ghostbusters, huh? Right, but I don't bust ghosts, I make 'em. Just tell me the story, huh? So, I'm followin' this guy around. This guy's got on a blue shirt, khaki pants, hush puppies. I don't know what the fuck-- he must've been at a fuckin' sale at j.Crew or some shit. But anyway, it's neither--Frankie, where's the fuckin' coffee? Can I finish?Go ahead. The fuck you go for it. What's this? Come here. What is this shit? Don't give me this pink shit! Give me sugar! Sugar! Just 'cause you're on a fuckin' diet doesn't mean everybody else has to eat that shit. Can I have your attention? Tell me the story. So, I'm out. I'm followin' this guy around. We're hoppin' from bar to bar. This guy's a real big-shot. He's buying drinks for everybody in the house. This asshole even bought me a drink. Can you believe that shit? Bought you a drink?Isn't that ironic? It's ironic.Anyway... It is ironic.I just said it was ironic. Do you know what that means?Yeah, I know what it means. All right, listen...Finish the fuckin' story. All right, anyway, it's gettin' late, and at this point, with all the little sniff and the drinks, I could be considered legally intoxicated, you know? I don't have all my faculties about me. How many times I gotta tell you you gotta be tight on a job? Would you just let me finish the story? So, the guy leaves the spot, right? I'm followin' him and followin'. For some reason, this guy takes a walk through the park. So there's no one around. I grab him from behind, bust him over the head. The guy goes down like a sack of shit. There's blood everywhere. It's like a-- a Kodak moment. The son of a bitch goes down. I turn him over, and you know how they say that everyone's got a, um... Like a-- like a twin? What do you call it? A d-- you know, like when... What? People kind of like-- like, there's two of you, double duty... Doppelganger?right, a doppelganger. I can't imagine what your fuckin' doppelganger looks like. Just get to the story.That poor bastard. All right, so I turn him over, and it's not my guy. He's got on the same sweater, same pants, same hush puppies, the same shit, but it's the wrong guy. I cracked the wrong guy. Can you believe that shit? I was pissed off. Jesus Christ. Is that bad? Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. It's bad, right? No, i--i--i saw him. He was bloodied up. But I recognize this poor prick down there. It's this guy-- I saw him downtown. He's like a connected guy or somethin'. I mean, this guy's got juice. You got a fuckin' problem. I'm not really the one with the problem now. He is. Right? I mean, what the hell's he doin' walkin' in the park at 3:00 in the mornin', right? Asshole. You really fucked up this time. Does Ronnie know about this yet? He'll know soon enough. It's bad, right? Hey, baby. Good morning, gorgeous. We got any aspirin? No, we're all out. [Sighs] So, what's on your day planner today? I'm doing a favor for Madison. I'm gonna walk her dog petey. Doesn't she have other people that can walk her dog for her? Well, it's not really a dog. It's her brother-in-law, and he's going on his first job. She's a little nervous he ain't ready. He's a bit of a live wire. And avi ain't the kind of cat to meow if he loses his shit, right? [Groans] So, what are you gonna do about August? I don't want to talk about August. Whatever. Hey, do you think he likes tulips or daisies? Huh? For his headstone. You think he'd like tulips or daisies? I like tulips. I think he'd like tulips. Don't try to pretend like you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about you trying to save August from catching a bullet in the brain. Any way you slice it, August gets got. You're trying to throw a lifesaver to a man who's floating face down. Pray for him or pity him, but don't try to rescue him. You know, you don't understand August and me. Hmm. I got him into this whole thing. Kicking and screaming. Oh, poor guy. Why am I even trying to talk to you about loyalty. Loyalty to you and most women in america means shoppin' in the same store twice, right? Don't try to turn this into a man-woman thing. Trying to save something that can't be saved ain't no man-woman thing. It's just a fuckin' waste of time. I'm just saying there's a bond between men that women just don't have. Really, now? All the best teams are men. Who? Butch Cassidy, Sundance kid. Tom Sawyer, huck Finn. E.t. And Elliott. How do you know e.T.'S a guy? Oh, you didn't see? He's got a huge penis. E.t. Stands for extra testicles. How about lone ranger and Tonto? Ah... Kramden and Norton. Norton. Mm-hmm. The main difference between men and women... When things go south, men stand together, women bail. August would let you choke on your own vomit if it meant 50 cents. You know, it's a shame you don't feel the same way about me as you do about August. We'd be like joanie and chachi. Who?[laughs] You watch too much TV. Gotta get out more. [Tea kettle whistling] Don't worry about this. I'll get this. Fuckin' slob. [Ronnie] You don't understand August and me. You don't. I got him into this whole thing. [August] Yo, is he dead? I don't know. I shot him. He's probably dead. Damn. That's what I thought the first time. Now, listen, 'cause I'm tellin' ya. You don't ever shoot nobody without a contract or a reason. What about five grand? Pretty good reason. Yo, yo, did he just move? No, that's you, man. You're shaking. Yo, i--i never killed anybody before. You know that, right? The first time's the hardest, right? Don't worry about it. Your record's still intact. You still didn't kill nobody. What are you talking about? He's--he's dead. This is one dead guy, but you didn't have a thing to do with it. What do you mean? We both shot him. I shot him, and you shot him. No. I shot him. You missed him. How do you know I missed? I had my eyes open when I pulled the trigger. The fact of the matter is, is you didn't kill this guy. And we're splitting 10 grand for a job that I completed on my own. So, what are you sayin'? I'm sayin', so maybe I should keep all the money. No, you can't do that. Oh, no? Why not? 'Cause I'll fuckin' shoot you. You'd miss. Well, yo, I want my money, man. What do I gotta do now? You do the job that you're being paid for. You kill the guy. He's already dead!Then kill him again! Yo, I can't shoot him, man. He's down. He's already dead. I can't do that. Whatever your problem is, August, pullin' the trigger, get over it. You want your money? You got to stand behind your work. Okay. [Cocks gun] August. Okay, okay, okay. [Gunshot] Ooh! Shit! Fuck. You see that?I saw it. Do it again. [Cocks gun] [Gunshot] Oh, fuck, man! [Heavy breathing] Yo, I killed him again. Ho--! Come on, let's get out of here, man, before we're swimmin' in blue boys. [August] Ronnie was right-- two bullets and a dead body, and I was hooked. This lifestyle, what we do-- for most guys, it's all about the money, but for me, it was about playing god. I can see that now. If Ronnie knew all this was gonna happen, pshh, I bet he would have left me back in that movie theater where he found me. Now Ronnie thinks he could buy me time by doing favors for these assholes, like Madison, the big bitch in town. I owe her a few bucks. What's the big deal? She's got a hard-on for me. Now Ronnie's trying to throw some water on a couple of my fires, but the guy should have brought a bigger hose 'cause Rome is burning fast. [Helicopter whirring] [Beep] [Dialing] [Ringing] [Woman] Hello? It's Ronnie. Ronnie! What do you want? I'm just checkin' in. I got your deer in my headlight. You called to tell me you haven't finished the job? I'm callin' to make sure that what we talked about, it's, uh... Still the case. I told you, Ronnie, I won't touch him, but this is no grandfather clause. If he fucks up again, all bets are off. I become Houdini, and he disappears, got it? I understand. Do you? I doubt it. Don't forget about our network friend. [Gunshot] I did it as fast as I could! Give me a fuckin' break, will ya? How you doin'? Good.did you win? Yeah. Did she cheat? Oh, no, not with me. Don't you dare eat that orange. Oh, yeah. Yes. What the fuck are you doin' in here? Well, did you ever hear of knockin'? You do it with your knuckles. It sounds like this. You here to fix this thing? Are you a fuckin' comedian? Sit down. Please. Mr. Devro, I placed this gun on your desk to answer the question that's running through your head. I'm plenty serious. I do need to talk about something with you about a matter that may be a little unpleasant. That gun real? Ow. It's as real as romance, Mr. Devro. My driver calls me Mr. Devro. Please, call me Chad. It's a real pleasure, Chad. And what do you go by?Just Ronnie's fine. [Nervous chuckling] "Just Ronnie's fine." Okay. I--i love ya. How did you get past Jade? Oh, I did what it took.That's fuckin' great. You're the real McCoy, aren't ya? I gotta know, w-w-what can I do for ya? God damn, that's a real gun! [Nervous laughter] This really works a lot better with you intimidated, so if I have to take measures today to intimidate you further, Chad, today will not be "easy like Sunday morning." Ronnie, I'm sorry. It's just that... [Clears throat] I've never met anyone like you before. I do a lot of tough-guy, gangster shows on TV. Smoking gun?Mine. But I've never actually met a gangster up close. You don't need to intimidate me, Ron. Listen, whatever you want, whatever you want, Ronnie. Whatever you want, just let me know. Pinched... Is running an episode on Nicky caputo. Ah. I'm here to interrupt your regularly scheduled program. That's it? Oh, hell, listen-- I'm not done yet. You live downtown in a high rise on, uh, 5th Avenue. You have a wife, Janice. Bitch. You have two sons, Jack and Bernard. Ingrates, both of them. And if the show runs, we'll see to it that they die. Sounds good to me. [Laughing] Listen, Ron. I told you, I love it. I'm not resisting. You don't want the episode to run, it's a memory, gone.Gone? Gone.that's it? That's it. Okay. Hey, I got somethin' for you. Did you see our special news report today? Some shit went down. [Gunshots] Oh, yeah? What kind of shit was that? It just happened. This guy is getting a Hummer in his home-away-from, when, as they say, he needed that like a bullet in the head. Right here. One shot. Unbelievable. Simon baltz. Ever hear of him, Ronnie? Senatorial candidate Simon baltz. Married. Conservative senatorial candidate Simon baltz. It seems Mr. Baltz was more than a little chummy with Nick caputo. Cops are pretty sure it was a hit. This guy was backin' Nicky caputo, huh? Well, that is interesting. Well, it was nice meetin' you.Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Ronnie, what's your hurry? Ron, stay a while. It's not every day I get a chance to talk to a guy like you. Call it, uh, research. Call it whimsical. Call it goofy. [Laughs] Call it goofy. You're right. Listen, call it a favor. I got a few minutes. Got any more of these little visits planned today? The less you know, the better. Trust me. Ah, ah, ah. Shh. Let me tell you a little somethin' about my brain, Ronnie. My brain... My brain. My brain, Ronnie. It's like a crystal ball. It's like a--a-- a television. It sees things. Do you know what my brain is tellin' me right now? Do you know what my brain is seeing right now? It's seein' you. It's seein' you fit into a 27-inch television every Thursday night at 10:00 P.M. I'm talking bad. I'm talking tough. I'm seeing you with a gun. Chicks, blood, gangsters. I'm seeing you killing a big, fat, black gangster rapper, and I'm hearin', Ronnie-- I'm hearin' a theme song. ♪ Bop-bop-bop, bop-bop-bop bam! Work with me, Ronnie. You're meetin' guys. Big guys. You're knockin' over jewelry stores. Timpani drum. Boom. Bam-bam-bam. Ronnie. You get ba-bum, baga-ba-bum-bum-ba, bam! And...you're walkin'. You're walkin' the streets. Walkin' the streets. You're walkin' the streets every night and every day, Ronnie. You're walkin' the streets. And the show is called-- the show is called... Streetwalker. ♪ Bum-bum, ba-da-bum-bum-bum-bum ♪ ♪ ba-da-bum-bum, streetwalker ♪ ♪ bum-bum, ba-da-bum, streetwalker ♪ ♪ bum-ba-dum I love it! Let's make some TV shows here, Ronnie. [Keyboard clacking] You're fucking mad. No.what do you mean "no"? I mean no, as in negative. No. I mean, what part of that you miss? Maybe I was moving a little too fast for you, Ronnie. Do you have any idea how many heterosexual waiters would suck a dick for an opportunity like this? Lots and lots. What are we talkin' about here? I mean, just say it. Money. Ducats. Revenue. Violence equals ratings equals money. People like me, do what I do, should be feared, not revered. I mean, I can't help it if people find it attractive. It's like that accident on the freeway-- you just gotta slow down and take a look at it. They call it human nature, Ron. No, it's called human error, Chad. Now, I can't help the situation, but I don't want to perpetuate it. I appreciate your time, Mr. Devro. Okay. Hey! Don't be a stranger there, Ronnie! [Door opens] Call me. Let's do this thing. Let's make this thing happen. [Door slams shut]Eh, fuck it. ♪ Ba-da-da-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, bop-bop-bop, streetwalker ♪ That wasn't a real fuckin' gun. [Ronnie] Hey, what were you saying before about how you jackin' some guy can bring you closer to god? No, not closer to god. Closer to being like god. There's a big difference. Being closer to god is just a spiritual thing, you know, like chanting or praying, that kind of shit. But bein' god-like is havin' the power to control someone's destiny. You know, like someone's life is goin' like this and you make it go like that. Yeah. It's my decision. It's my goal. Unless, of course, you got specific instructions to do the guy, then... That has nothin' to do with me being god-like at that point. But-- and this is why I like my job, Ronnie. You know, it's amazing how the littlest things can affect my actions, you know how I'm irritable, right? So if some stupid shit, like some traffic cop gives me a ticket, it could screw up my whole day. And the poor bastard I'm in front of doesn't have a chance. Man, let me ask you a question. Do you think god has pity on these people we go after? I mean, look at some of the stuff they're involved with-- adultery, loan sharking, bribery. I mean, we're here because they're breaking commandments, too. It's not like we pick these people out of a phonebook, right? Yeah, I don't know if god approves of what I'm doing. I mean, you know, I'm comfortable with who I am. That's gotta count for something, right? I mean, this is just who August is. How you doin'? You all right? What you got there, huh? Yeah, yeah. What's so funny? That just sounded funny. "This is just who August is." Yeah, well, I am what I am. Maybe it's just the name, you know. It never sounded funny before. August. Aug-- how did that happen? I never told you this story? You know, my mom, god bless her soul-- you know, she wasn't exactly a rhodes scholar. You know, she wasn't the, uh, sharpest knife in the drawer. You know, she just-- she wasn't good under pressure like US. You know, she-- she couldn't read. You know, she could read. She just didn't read that well, so after she squeezed me out, they made her fill out all these forms, you know, like birth certificate, citizenship-- I don't know if they have to do that where you come from, but here, she had to do the forms, and, you know, I think where she was supposed to put my name, she put my birth date. Fucked up thing is I was born in September. I don't really know what happened. I think that she got confused. You know, she wasn't really a good test-taker, I think. It could have been worse, right? She could have thought it was for where they put my horoscope sign. Imagine that. I would have had to go through life with a fuckin' name like Leo. That name sucks. Anyway, thanks for comin'. I really appreciate it. What are you lookin' at me like that for? Take it easy, son. I don't take it easy. I don't fuck men. I fuck men up. Well, that you do, Augustus. That you do. Salud,mom. [Upbeat violin music] [No audible dialogue] ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ yeah [August] So why would a guy like this, like Ronnie, give a fuck about a guy like me at the end of the day? Guess that's like askin' a parent why they love their kid, right? You see, Ronnie gave me this life, and when you bring something into this world, you do whatever you have to do to keep it alive. Until there's nothin' left of either of you. Donnie and Marie, a couple of heavy-hitters from the south. There he is. [August] No one knew if they were brother and sister, or lovers, or what. And, uh, most were scared to ask. Lookin' for a taxi? [August] You see, these two aren't exactly mormons. You'll see what I mean. Hey, take the cab. Leave the cannolis. You in? I'm in like sin, sugar. Donnie?uh-huh. What do you think she's gonna be wearin'? She'll be wearin' a fuzzy bear costume with red, puffy ribbons and pink, polka-dot panties. I mean, what the fuck do you think she'll be wearin', Marie? Clothes. Probably nice. Nice, uptown, classy kind of clothes. I hate when you say that.When I say what? I hate when you say that. When you say, someone's like this, someone's done that. I know you mean me. If you mean me, say me. Too much to fuckin' ask? Is this about that pizza?Oh, man. Honey, because if it is, I am so sorry. You are-- sweetheart, I did not know you were savin' that. I ate it. I digested it. My bowels have moved it. It's over, sugar. You know everythin', don't you? It's not about the pizza, all right? It's not about the fuckin' pizza.All right. Let's just do this, be done with it, and move on, all right? It's still daylight. I don't want to do this in the daylight, Marie. But here we are. It's chancy. Fuckin'-- fuckin' chancy. I thought my days of chance were over, but I guess not. I was savin' that fuckin' pizza for breakfast! I'm so sorry, darlin'. Hey, taxi! And there she is. 4:45. Man's a genius you can set your watch by. 42nd and 5th. Who the fuck are you? The navigator? Nah, that's just my sister. She's here to keep me company, help change the radio stations around. Right. He got no taste. He likes country. Now, where'd you say you're goin' again? Jesus Christ. It must be "let the deaf drive" week. I said I'm going to 42nd and 5th Avenue. And watch the fuckin' potholes, will you? [Sniffs] Maybe you could settle an argument for US. Don't bother me, huh? See, Donnie and me, we've been havin' this argument about Van halen. I wanna-- i-i-i-i'm not too clear on this. You said you two are arguing about Van halen? Yes, ma'am.Van halen being...? The rock 'n' roll band, honey! Don't you know? I don't give a fuck, don't you know? Oh, come on, sugar! It's Van fuckin' halen! Van fuckin' halen!Eddie Van halen! The guitar licks of Eddie Van halen!Christ, shut up! And the deafenin' drum beats of his brother, Alex. And the--you fuckin' liars. And the intoxicating bass of Michael Anthony. Jesus Christ.Van fuckin' halen! Oh, my god! Please! They're a great b-- this is a great band. A great band.Great band. Great fuckin' band.I know. That is not the argument. The argument comes in when we discuss the lead singer. Now, on the one hand, you have David Lee roth. Diamond Dave. Total show-off.Bullshit. No, all style, no substance.Bullshit. Fired and kicked out from that band for suckin'. And then the big dive into musical obscurity after two solo attempts proved him to be the lounge singer that he always was. Then, on the other hand, you have Sammy hagar. Yeah, a bigger show-off. ♪ I can't drive 55 belts every note out like he's, you know, Michael fuckin' Bolton. But, of course, that point is moot. Listen, can I ask you a question? Hello? I assume that this car is just like any other car. Am I right? This cab is a cab like any other cab. Right?yes, ma'am. It works on gasoline?Yes, ma'am. And a battery?Battery-operated, yes. And it's not any futuristic kind of car, am I right? No, ma'am, it's actually a '78. Then this cab doesn't depend upon the sound of your voice to get me where I'm goin', does it? I mean, I'm gonna reach my destination whether you talk or not. That's right. Then shut the fuck up, will you? Goddamn it! My god! Jesus Christ, you're givin' me a fuckin' migraine headache! You know, I could have you both killed. Fuckin' idiots. Yeah, tell me to shut the fuck up, right? That's right. Tell me to shut the fuck up. Yeah, that's really fuckin' cool. [Sniffing] Hey, what's up, pussycats? I said-- I said 42nd and 5th! I mean, I thought between the two of you, I could at least get where i'm-- fuck me. You condescending cunt. Doesn't even know Van halen. Doesn't even care. I feel like I should say somethin' to you right about now. Yeah, somethin' that might shed a little bit of light on some facet on the meaning of life, how we should all just stop to appreciate how lucky we are just to be alive. Yeah, see, 'cause I'm the gunman, and you're my hit. You're my bread and butter today. I owe you that much. Ain't he swank? Well, sorry, nothing's springing to mind. Don't you know who I am? Oh, I know who you were. [Gunshots] Hey. Donnie and Marie. So, did you take care of my problem? Don't you know who I am? [Gunshot]Permanently. Permanently? I thought that was only on an if-fuckin'-necessary basis. You ever try to reason with that woman? Necessary, chancy, but unavoidable. Yeah, she never could take "yes" for an answer. Rocco, come here, kid. I have some good news.What? You're gonna be livin' with me now. What do you think about that? What do you fuckin' think about that, dad? Hey, watch your mouth. I think it's great. I want you to go in the back and tell Frankie up front to give you some work to do.Yeah. Gotta earn your way, you know. We're partners.Yeah, I know. Help each other out. Okay.Hey, can I get one of these, pops? Yeah, go ahead.Thanks, dad. Just brush your teeth afterwards.Uh-huh. And put a shirt on, will you? Yeah. The health department comes in here, they're gonna shut me down. Uh-huh, yeah. He's always gotta have the last answer. Kids.kids. Let's go outside, talk. [August] Nicky caputo... He brought up Donnie and Marie to knock off his ex-wife who was tryin' to take his kid. Talk about your family values. Well, this is it. Wow. What do you think? Great. Like it? What's this one here called, guy? A Venus flytrap. Fuckin' eats animals. And I'm a vegetarian. [Laughs] An animal that eats plants. [Laughs] Sit down. Thanks for taking care of that situation for me. Salud. Family things can be delicate. Anyway, it's over, you know? My son's back where he belongs-- with his father. He's back where I want him, where he wants him to be. Everybody's happy, right? Rocco's happy. You two are happy. I'm happy. Everybody's happy, right?Except Deborah. Yeah, well, fuck Deborah, okay? You can't please everybody all the time. Try doing that, you might as well fuck yourself in the ass. It's fun for a while, but then again, it gets a little monotonous, doesn't it? See? I told you. Down south we got a saying-- "ain't enough bones in the world to keep a bitch happy." Bones? [Growling] [Laughs] The courts wouldn't give me that kid back, but I got him back, didn't I? Thanks to you two. Now, you're a good-- good father there, guy. And he's a good kid. You're right. I am a good father, and he is a good kid. He's gonna stay that way. If he starts that cat in the cradle shit, I give him the back of my hand. Ooh. Gotta be like me, not some little pansy like she'd make him. What is it? You haven't touched your wine. You want some... Or somethin'? Uh, no, thanks, guy. We're monogamous. Whatever. See frank on your way out. He'll take care of you with the money. Are you two really brother and sister? What do you think? I think it's none of my fuckin' business, okay? Just like my business is none of yours. Listen, kid, I got somethin' else I want you to do for me. We're scheduled to leave tomorrow. Without a schedule, I mean, guy, what do we got, you know? You got tonight, and tonight's the night, right, kid? [August] Nicky gave Donnie and Marie a couple more jobs to do. Shit. Just when you think you know what's gonna happen next... So, here's Ronnie lookin' for me at my girlfriend Paige's place. She and Ronnie had a little thing before he went and got himself married. I don't think she ever totally got over him. But I could give a shit. She's not goin' anywhere. [Buzzer sounds] Yo, it's Ronnie. It's Ronnie! You there? Hey, Paige! [Door opens] [Door closes] You're gettin' as sneaky as your old man. Where is he? Is he in? August? Where is he? How should I know? It's when he's right in front of me. That's when I know he's here. [Humming] Still performin'?Uh-huh. What is this, maid's day off?Fuck off. So, where is he? When's he coming back? Do you know? I don't know. I gotta go. Hey. Hey, no. Can you catch that thing?Yeah. You can't go. Stay here.Huh? You're gonna relax. You look like shit. You're a bad girl. You know that, Paige? You still get away with this shit with people? No, only you. Want anything? Yeah, I'm good. Wanna get high? Are you mad? Want a glass of milk or somethin'? I don't drink dairy. Got any aspirin? I'm sorry... No drugs you can buy over the counter. The weirdest thing just happened to me, Paige. So tell me. [Ronnie] I was headin' to some club to pick up this kid petey, tryin' to buy August some breathin' room with Madison. Between my roof-top adventures with the senator and Madison's brother-in-law, my pal August has kept me real fuckin' busy today. He's not exactly employee of the month, if you know what I mean. For every action, there's an equally violent reaction. And fuckin' over Nicky caputo is something I can't even really think about right now. I have other things on my mind. [Man] Damn! So I get to the place, and there he is, little man petey. Tough guy. I hate workin' with amateurs. I wouldn't work with amateurs even when I was an amateur. And petey... He reeked of stupidity. I didn't have to smell his breath to realize this kid spends a lot of time with his head up his ass. Are you Ronnie? That's Ronnie. I gotta go. Bye-bye. You don't pull a piece out in public unless you're gonna use it. That's common knowledge, right? That's how I've always felt. [Ronnie] I swear to god, if August puts me in this position again-- They call this part the calm before the storm. Please don't fuck me. Come on, man. I'm solid, all right? Solid like a rock. [Ronnie] I can tell why Madison would want me to hold petey's hand through this exchange with avi. Fucking speed freak. Doing drugs and dealing drugs at the same time can be a very bad thing. Oh, man! I don't think I can handle this, Ronnie. I'm not really good with blood, bro. Get in there. It'll get better fast. [Chickens clucking] [Laughing] Ronnie... [Ronnie] Now, I've dealt with avi before, and I gotta say, it ain't exactly my favorite place to conduct business. The plan is to get in, get out. A quick exchange of product for capital. Madison gets happy, August gets time. [Avi] Oh... [Laughing] Well, now look what we have here. [Laughing] Ronnie, I expected to see you. Madison told me to expect one man. And look at this. We have twice that. A little unsure. This kid's a little green. No, I wouldn't have guessed. Huh? You doin' okay? You know somethin', Ronnie? I think you're gonna have to change someone's diapers when we finish our business here. Speaking of which... You know the routine. [Ronnie] So far, things are goin' smooth, but I'm keeping one eye on petey. He was shifting around, acting nervous. I don't know, man. What the fuck? And this kid avi, he's got instincts like an animal. Once he smells fear, you're his. [Laughter] [Laughter] I see all the cocks aren't in cages. [Laughter] Whoa! [Ronnie] Showtime. Ronnie! [Chickens clucking] [Ronnie] Then somethin' really weird happened. Well, it was, like, in-my-head weird. Like everythin' around me stopped, and all of this world was this childhood scene that was just playing out in my head. [Man] Listen to me, Ronnie, 'cause I'm tellin' you, there's a common bond among men that should never be taken lightly. Seasons come and go, but a good friend is timeless. And everything else gets devoured. As you mature, Ronnie, you'll experience many new things-- new sights, sounds, smells-- some filled with pleasure, some marked with pain. If you're lucky enough to find that special friend, you do whatever it takes to keep it goin', even when the goin' gets hard. That's right, Ronnie. Nourish that friendship, 'cause life is fleeting, just like god. Remember that. A good friend is a life-long investment. You do whatever you must to keep the friendship alive and breathing. [Thunder crackles] [Organ plays] Until there's nothing left of either of you. That's pretty fuckin' strange, Ronnie. Was your father always saying shit like that? I never met my father. Look at that! He's screaming! Is this painful? It looks uncomfortable. [Laughter] [Gunshot] Ronnie! Motherfucker! Ronnie, you're disturbin' my birds. Huh, Ronnie... Take it easy, kid. Take it easy. Avi, put the gun down, prick. He was your responsibility, Ronnie. It's not gonna end like this now. Come on, now, ro-- Ronnie! Put the gun down! It seems we have a problem, my brother. You know what has to happen now. Back off and shut up. All right? Now, back off, shut up! [Ronnie] In hostage situations, there are no winners. You may be able to prolong the inevitable, but come to think of it, that's a pretty good reason to stick a gun in some bloke's back. Quit yelling in my fuckin' ear! My name's Leo, all right? I don't even like my fuckin' job! You know what? You know what I did for the last 10 years of my life? I was a fucking casting director! Give me a fuckin' break! I work in a chicken shack!Hey, easy! I've read about these situations. Remain calm. [Heavy breathing] Almost there. Not the elevator! [Ronnie] When the message is bad, sometimes they kill the messenger. When a job goes bad, they kill everyone. Answer.[ringing] Answer, answer, answer. Answer. Hello! Get Madison. Nice manners, Mr. Rude. I said, get Madison on the fuckin' phone! Good-bye. [Dial tone] Are you fucking kidding me?! Fucking kidding me?! Ronnie! [Yelling in distance] [Chickens clucking] Ronnie, you son of a bitch! [Elevator powers up] Ronnie! Okay. You want a piece of this, you fuck? [Beeping] Madison. Madison? I owe that bitch 20 thou. What's up? August. I'm about to get my plug pulled by avi's men. What? Avi? Are you serious? A deal just went bad. The sky's fallin' in. He's following me right now.Yo, yo, yo, put him on the phone. Put him on the phone. I'll take care of this shit. August--I'll fuck this one up, all right? Ronnie. Avi. Come here, kid. Oh.this one's for you. Yeah?this one's for you. Everybody's gonna be cool, okay? Huh, be cool. This is for you.I'm taking the telephone. Hello? Who is this? I'll Bury your fuckin' ass, you understand? You know, he was just goin' on and on and on, so I figured I'd just save your battery. With friends like this, who needs enemies? Now, what were we gonna do? [Beeping] May I? Please do. August, you motherfucker! I'm sorry. [Whispers] Madison. Hey, Madison, how you doin'? Oh, it's a long story. Never mind. Oh. Oh, yeah, that guy flipped out, and now he's in pieces. Who was that masked man? Oh, he was. Sorry. Okay. Okay. No, he didn't. Yeah, he did. Yeah, I'm lookin' at him right now. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh, sure. Oh, that's no problem. Oh, that's more than fair. No, no, no. No, saffron. Yeah, saffron, and a hint of nutmeg. Just a hint. Brings out that flavor. Oh, that's nice. Oh, okay. Okay. All right, then. Uh-huh. Well, I'll see you around the club. Shalom,baby. The governor called-- governess, to be precise. You've been pardoned. Easy, easy. Whoa, Nelly. Down. Down, boy. Fuckin' thing down.Put it down. Put it down. It's okay. It's all right. If I were you, I would hop on a bus and go to Atlantic city. 'Cause today is your lucky fuckin' day. Go on. Get the fuck out of here. Ugh! [Coughing] [Dana] I want you to keep one thing in mind-- August would let you choke on your own vomit if it meant 50 cents. [Heavy breathing] Blood, chickens-- dirty, filthy fuckin' birds, man. They were eatin' each other. Just another fuckin' perfect day. It's so fuckin' exciting, Ron. You know that shit gets me hot. Hey, take it easy, okay? August is my best friend, even though he almost got me killed today. He doesn't own me. I fuck who I want, and that includes you. You're a bad girl. But it ain't gonna happen. Are you afraid of augy? Your blood's gotta be pumping. Why don't you pump some of that into me? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey! Come on. That was a long time ago. Fine. Let me ask you this then. When you were in that elevator and you thought you were gonna die-- you did think you were gonna die, didn't you? Yeah, I thought I'd bought the farm. Mm-hmm. So, when you were in that elevator and you thought what you thought was gonna be your last thought, what'd you think? Who'd you think about? Tell me your last thought. Was it about me? Was it about Dana? [Speaking French] Stop! And you know you can't talk about my wife. Enough! Don't tell me who the fuck I can and can't talk about! Anytime you want, you can exit from the rear! [Speaking French] You're mad, you know that? I forgot how mad you are. And you're fucking crazy. Hey, come on. Be nice. Come on, Ron. Just one more time. For old time's sake. Come on. How about you let me sleep on your couch? For old time's sake, let me keep this nice and simple. So, what was that last thought, Ronnie? Tell me. You know what I hate? What? Elevators. You hate elevators? As--as a rule? That's right. I don't-- I don't use 'em. I've eliminated them from my life completely. And don't think it's because I'm worried about them falling out of the sky or something stupid like that, even though that happens more than you know. What you got against elevators? It's not just me, it's... You know, I don't think you could appreciate this. I think this might be above your head. All right, listen, 'cause this is important. Are you aware that 84.5% of the American public uses an elevator every day to get to and from work? I mean, it's become such a regular occurrence that people don't even think twice about it. It makes me sick. You understand that america's become the laziest country in the world. Well, what about France? That's a good point, Ronnie, but the French aren't lazy. They're just pussies. I mean, look at some other countries, though. Take Korea, for example. I got a lot of respect for those pricks. The elevator to them is a western invention. They frown upon it. It's like opium. It's fuckin' evil. What about Israel? You think they take elevators? I don't think so. You know that it's mandatory for every swinging cock and tit over there to serve in the army? Mandatory. Birds and all? What I just say? Every schmuck goes. Mandatory stuff. I didn't know that. Well, start knowing it, okay? Because those shysters are pointin', and plottin', and plannin' for a takeover. You know how much money the national security council spends watching these renegade countries? Trillions. But it don't matter, because one day the end is coming. I'm telling you, it's gonna happen. End of what? Do I have to spell it out for you? We've been kicking so much ass for so long that one day some small country that no one thinks about, that no one even talks about, is gonna come along and pick up the check. You know? Fix the wagon. Fix the wagon. Clean our clock. Ring our bell. You know, the fuckin' bell with the clock and the tower. Oh, yeah. So, what do you think about escalators? That's a good question. I thought a lot about that, and my answer is, is that at first, an escalator is a moving stairway, so it's a tricky subject, right? But in the end, it's just another death sentence for america. You're not foolin' me, you sneaky bastards. You're an angry son of a bitch, ain't you? Suspicion beats confidence. Only the paranoid survive, rondo. You ever think about quittin' all of this? What do you mean? Like write my memoirs? Cash in on a little book deal? What are you? Crazy? Nah, I'm not startin' over. What am I gonna... Start over? I haven't-- I got a good thing goin' here. I got 26 jobs under my belt already. I mean, you wouldn't tell Burt Reynolds to start over, would you? You know, I never, um, got a chance to thank you, for, um... okay. You know, sort of bein' like a big brother, you know, like a mentor to me. Now kill him again. But i-i-- you know, I-I appreciate it. [Intercom] Emergency evacuation. This is not a drill. [Gunshot] ♪ I wanna be... [Humming] Paige. ♪ And nobody else but you ♪ Come on, babe, I got a fuckin' headache. Give me a break, will ya? I'm serenading you, baby. It's too early for that. It's almost a quarter to 10:00 at night. Exactly. It's too early. Mm. Still going to tiger lounge? No, more like a party. A group of hot-shot lawyers are having a Kennedys party, and they want a little Marilyn. Do you want to come? Who am I gonna be? Arthur Miller? Suit yourself, sweetie. How long was I out? No idea. Phone rang while you were asleep, and I answered it. Why'd you answer my phone?It was ringing. Don't worry. Dana didn't call. Which leads to the next question... Well, you got two phone calls. The first one was from Madison. She said she wanted to meet you for dinner at bones. Ooh, at 10:00. What time is it now? 9:45. I better go. Don't you want to know who the second call was from? It was August. August? Why didn't you wake me? Oh, you looked so peaceful and cute. What'd he say? He wanted to know why I was answering your phone, and I told him we'd just finished fucking and you were in the shower washing my smell off you. That's very funny. I said you were having dinner with Madison at 10:00. He wants to meet you after at Chinatown. I told him I'd pass it on. Where is he? Like I ask those questions. Fuck it. I gotta go. [Door opens] [Door closes] [August] I-I never killed anybody before. First time's the hardest, right? Nice place.Thanks. Yeah. How you doin'? All right? Yeah. Good, good. Yeah. Will you be redeeming any coupons today? No.i didn't think you would. All right... So, uh, right here? Good. Yeah, sure. So, um, all right. So, let's get right to it. Okay? All right. Let's just, uh, jump right in. It sticks. I can fix it. It doesn't matter. All right, um, beautiful. So, uh... That's embarrassing. The drawers are on me. [Laughs] Okay, you know what? Maybe not with that. Um, oh, you see this? This is nice. This is a good, uh... This is-- this is good. This is a heavy piece. It holds nine and one to go. But it's a good piece for up close, you know or whatever your pleasure. Um, but see, I know motherfuckers like you. You're discriminating. You want the-- yeah. Um, you-- you prefer revolvers. So, you know what? That's what I got. Boom, right there. You got a nice revolver, all right? That's a good back-up piece, and I'll tell you why. You could use black talons, a hollow point, dum-dums, or mixed fruit! You could juggle 'em, shoot 'em in the... Who cares? Doesn't matter. Anything you want. All right, good. All right, so... Oh! Look what I got. Now look what I got. Come on. Stop it. Look at that. Look. Can you look at that? That's a beautiful piece. See, that's a sig sauer 9mm. That holds 14 in the mag, one up the ass. Oh, it's beautiful. See, I'm gonna level with you. I never personally used the sig, but I know a bunch of niggas swear by this motherfuckin' gun. The beautiful thing about any of these guns is if you shoot somebody with 'em, they die. And I think that might be what you wanna do with it. If that's your inclination, if that's your particular slant, I'm gonna work out a sweet deal with you. If you act now, act fast, operators are standing by, I'm gonna give you a little special parting gift, huh? How about this? Nice. You buy two, you get the little thing free. And here's what you do. You put it on. One goes on one arm, the other goes on the other arm. You wear 'em both at the same time. Isn't that nice? And I think it would look good on you, and I think it would look nice. I know how it works.I thought you might. And, uh, all right. So, uh... All right. All right, let's talk money. [Classical music plays] Excuse me. Excuse me.What's up, mate? Now what'd you do? Sir, I've done nothing, but one gets the feeling that perhaps mistakenly, you've come to the wrong place. We don't "super size" anything here. Your point being? You need a jacket to sit in there at the very least. Give me a break, will you? The only jacket I have is a full metal one. I'm sure you don't want to see that, right? I didn't think so. I'm gonna go inside. How are you? It's okay, Jeffrey. Ronnie's with me. And as far as I'm concerned, he's dressed to the nines. I'm sorry, ma'am. I thought your gentleman companion might feel more comfortable in a jacket. Good-bye, Jeffrey. Very good. So, this is what the fashionable young criminal is wearing these days. It's what I'm wearing. Mr. Blackwell would have a field day. How you doin'? I ordered some taittinger. Is that okay? That's fine. What are we celebratin'? Celebrating life. The life I saved-- yours. The life you saved, August's. And we're celebrating promise-- promise of a fine meal, promise of a second bottle, and promise of good company for the night. Well, that's until 11:00, 'cause I gotta go meet August. And by the way, after today... Give him a little room, all right? An hour of your time? That's what you're giving me after what I did for you today in the elevator?After what you did? What about after what your brother-in-law did for me at the slaughterhouse? I did you a little favor. I almost got killed. Back off, all right? He's a waste of time. Life is too short to waste. Today should've taught you that. What if my line was busy? What if I didn't call you right back? You'd be a stain on some elevator door. That's my concern, all right? If you're gonna go around risking your life, then it's my concern, too. You do good work, Ronnie, and I like you. Saving August is only gonna put your own life at risk. What if I told you I was...Retiring? [Scoffs] Don't be ridiculous. Retirement in this business is death, one way or the other. You make your choices in this life, and then you wake up every single day and you live with them. You married yourself to this job the first time you picked up a gun. I just ain't gonna make this. It's fuckin' killin' me. I'm dying inside. Stop stressing about this life and live it. Maybe I don't feel like courting death anymore. You're not goin' anywhere. Neither am I. Besides, you're a member of the club, and membership is irrevocable. Maybe you're right. Yeah, of course I'm right. How do you think I managed to survive for so long in this game? Madison. Yes, Ronnie. I gotta make a call. Hmm, I'll sit right here till you get back. You know, he's his own worst enemy. August? Not while I'm alive. [Dana] Hello? [Ronnie] Hey, you. Hey. Where are you, baby? Comin' home soon? I'll be home as soon as I can. August called. He was checking to make sure you were meeting him later. I said I hope not. Oh, yeah? What'd he say? He laughed. Don't go meet him, Ronnie. Just come home, okay? [Sighs] I can't explain this, okay? But I have to go, and I need to do this. You always put August first. Well, I'm sorry, Dana, about that. I really am. About what? About August? I'm sorry about-- just about everything right now. I just wanted you to know that. Dana, can you hear me? Dana. I love you. What's up? The sky.Yeah? What about you? You know, the same old shit. What's goin' on? How was your day? My best friend almost got me killed... Nothin' unusual. That? Well, you gotta let bygones be bygones. Don't let, uh, yesterday dictate tomorrow. Well, it was just a few hours ago, so, uh... I'll get there. Whatever. How was the rest of your day? All right. Where you coming from? Just met Roy. Came down here to see you. You?i had dinner with Madison. How was your day? Fuckin' Jonah knocked up his girlfriend. Must not have made the wife too happy. Usually doesn't, right?Right. She don't want to get rid of it, though, because she's catholic. So he tells me to, uh--make her not pregnant. Yeah, exactly. How'd you manage that one? You know, I did what I had to do. I, uh, broke into her apartment and waited for her. And, you know, she came in, and it was, like, this, uh... Real pretty Spanish girl. You know how they say, uh, women glow when they're pregnant? The girl looked, you know, so happy she was, like, glowin'. And I just-- then I... Grabbed her and just started hittin' her. You know, I was just punchin' her. I must have punched her like 10, 15 times. And then she's cryin', "no, no, my baby." Like, she's talkin' in Spanish. I started hittin' her harder 'cause I just wanted her to be quiet, you know? And I got nervous. I didn't think that the hitting was gonna work, you know? Like it was gonna-- whether or not it was gonna get rid of the baby. So I take out my gun. She panics. I guess she thought I was gonna shoot her or some shit, so... She started cryin' harder, but, like, that kind of... That kind of cry where it's so hard that nothing's comin' out of her mouth. And I'm hittin' her in the stomach with the gun. I don't know if that shit worked. I just fuckin' left. It was a mess. I don't know. I don't like hittin' women. I don't like doin' that shit. It ain't god-like. Scumbags do that shit. I don't know why he didn't just ask me to kill her. Fuckin' guy says to me, "don't kill her, because she gives the best head in the tri-state area." He's dead serious. Motherfucker better start usin' birth control, because I ain't never doin' no shit like that again ever. I don't give a fuck. I mean, I got some kind of ethics, right? I'm not a fuckin' animal. [Growling] I heard somethin' today.Yeah? Yeah, I heard that Madison had you do some dirt so she'd stay off my shit. You wanna tell me what that's all about? 'Cause I find it kind of interesting. Oh, yeah? Well, she was gonna have you ended, and I was in a position to make that not happen. That's it. Really?yeah. She was gonna have me ended? Yeah. I'll break this down for you, all right? Number one, if Madison or anyone else wants to take a shot at me, let 'em try, all right? Number two, I don't need you or anyone else lookin' out for me. I can take care of myself. And number three, I heard that you called her lookin' for a reprieval. She's already dead, so don't worry about Madison. She's dead?That's right. Yeah. Just like that? Exactly my point. Just like that. [Snaps fingers] You see? See what happens when you fuck around with me? Bad things. She say anything about me before she, uh, left? Yeah, she did. She said I would be dead before my head hit the pillow if I hang out with you much longer. Yeah, she's smart. [Sighs] You know, I've been thinking. Maybe it's time we just walk away from this shit, because things are getting a little stupid. Walk away? This is just like you. Let me tell you somethin', Ronnie. All right, when it's my time to go, I'm gonna go. There's nothin' you or anybody else could do about that shit. I'm at peace with that. You should be at, too. See, that's the beauty of criminal life, Ron. There's no, uh, questions. Only orders. That's bullshit, man.What do you mean it's bullshit? We have a choice.We don't got no choice, all right? We really don't. You'll see what I mean in a minute. You sure you don't want anything to eat? Nothin'? A wonton, some spare ribs, anything? You got any aspirin? I got a fucked-up headache. Had it all day. No, I can't help you with that, bro. You see the news today? Married senatorial candidate Simon baltz shot dead while getting head. That senator turned out to be backin' a friend of ours. Nicky caputo is pissed off. Ever hear of him, Ronnie? He's really pissed off. People gotta go down for this one. Where were you this afternoon? I caught a movie.Oh, yeah? What'd you see? Alice in wonderland. [Mimics buzzer] See, I wish you were tellin' me the truth, Ronnie. But I know you ain't. Are you? You know what's goin' on here, right? Yeah, I know what's goin' on. You don't have to do this, you know that. Yes, I do. It's my job. It's your fuckin' job, too. What, all of a sudden you're innocent, huh? You never killed nobody, huh? This is great, huh? I get paid to kill somebody, somebody pays you to kill me. What are we doin', man? I don't want to do this. I know. You know, there's a way out for-- for both of US. Yeah? Tell me. You got a piece on you? As always. We could shoot each other.Oh, yeah? I could shoot you. We could shoot each other. I could kill you, and you kill me. But I'm gonna kill you, Ronnie. I have to do it. There's no way around that. But if we kill each other, we could still be friends. We'll be dead.Whatever. Please. Please do it as a favor. No favor. I ain't shootin' you, August. Listen. Take the-- take your gun out, okay? Take your gun out, or I'm tellin' you, that woman over there is not gonna find out what her fuckin' fortune cookie says. You understand me? Good. Take it out. This is the best thing. I knew you'd do the right thing. It's the only way. Do me favor. Don't hit me low. Hit me as high as you can. Okay. Me, too. I don't want to be lying on the floor while 911 tries to save my sorry ass. Okay.all right? You ready? The usual, all right?Yeah. All right. [Cocks gun] Rock. Paper. Scissor. [Gunshot] Draw. What did you do? You lied to me. You fuckin'-- you lied to me. You said you would do it. You can't leave me by myself. You promised. You lied. You--you said... Hit me low. Good. You fuckin' die with pain, you liar. Good. Take it out. It's the only way. Do me a favor. Don't hit me low. [Gunshot] You promised. [August] We could have gone out together. It doesn't matter because, like I told you from the beginning, this is my last day in this life. [Tires screeching]
