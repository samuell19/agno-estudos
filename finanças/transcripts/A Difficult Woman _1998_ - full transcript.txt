(dramatic music) (bell tolling) (tense music) - Oh, Doctor MacFarlane? - Yes? - Detective Sergeant Gutteridge. Detective Cherry. - Oh, yes? - We're investigating a homicide. - Ah, of course. Giselle McKenzie, of course. How can I help you? - Last Friday evening you left a faculty dinner just before a young lady was attacked. Can anyone vouch for your whereabouts at the time of the attack? - No. - Also, we hear you're into Russian stuff. You know, knickknacks, collectibles, whatever. That true? - Who told you that? - Anne Harriman. Is it true? (keys jangling) (clock ticking) I want Taylor with a full evidence team down here ASAP. (tense music) - [Man] You want his clothes? - [Taylor] Yeah, take the lot. (tense music) This one's been read a lot. (pages rustling) How's that for a weapon? (tense music) - What's this one? - Um, "Agricultural and Industrial Implements of the Soviet Union 1925 to 1975." - [Dave] Real page turner. - Well, I'm trying to see if I can read any inscriptions. It's bloody hard, these pictures are shocking. - Why the hell would anyone buy a book like that? - Why would you get half this stuff? I mean, the guy's a fruit loop. He did it for sure. - This bloke MacFarlane lives on the campus, so it wouldn't raise suspicion if people saw him wandering around. He's got a Russian everything else, so why not a Russian wrench? Plus, he hasn't got a solid alibi for any one of the attacks. Seems he was home by himself every night. - So, means and opportunity. - Motive? - Well, if you believe Dr. Levin, the guy's a real sex fiend. (tense music) (telephone ringing nearby) - History has made us French. It may not be what we would have chosen, but if we deny this we are lying only to ourselves. I have come to see that the kind of independence we once wished for is an illusion. (group chattering) And so it is that I propose to cast my vote and the proxies I hold to all accepting French sovereignty over the islands of Teyauma Ohi. (group clamoring) - [Woman] Traitor! Traitor! - [Man] Coward! - [Woman] Traitor! - [Man] You're a coward, Martin! (dramatic music) - I wonder what Giselle would have made of all this. You've run away before, haven't you? Rema, wasn't it? Scanlon says you weren't responsible for that, either. - You don't know what you are talking about. Rema was killed by the police. - [Anne] So why did you run away? - [Dominic] If it was just me, I'd take my chances in court. But they can destroy the whole movement if this becomes public. Who would ever vote to give savages like us independence? - Did Giselle know all this? - No. Giselle didn't know. - So after the argument with Honore, she went to the uni to find out for herself? - Yes. - Then why did I see you just sell out your country there? - Honore De Grasset. He knows everything. He has this gun to my head. So my vote will go whichever way he wants. - Then why don't you tell someone? Tell Scanlon. I mean, he won't let the accord be corrupted by some-- - You really don't know anything. Do you? Scanlon's in on it. Nine billion dollars trade between Australia and France each year. I rang Scanlon as soon as I found Giselle in the carpark. He told me to get out of there as fast as possible. I wanted to ring an ambulance. He said no, they record your voice, and besides, she's already dead. What difference does it make? (tense music) - [Man] Three monkeys with three perfect scores inches from the finish line then this happens. - [Man] But I don't think I can do it without Dr. Harriman's permission. As you-- - Ah, just the person we wanted to see! Well, the other two monkeys are looking good, doing well. - Yes. - Well, far be it from me, but don't you think it mightn't be such a bad idea to isolate them? - [Anne] From? - The other monkey. The sick one. - Molly had a miscarriage, it's not contagious. - But you don't know what caused it. - Wei Li Ping, who is the best microbiologist in his field, is doing an analysis right now. Now, when he comes up with some answers-- - These monkeys are very valuable to us. - As they are to me. - We think there's an alternative that you haven't considered and you are clearly the most qualified and skilled person to perform it. You see, an autopsy would reveal-- - A what? - Well, just hear me out here. An autopsy would reveal-- - An autopsy is something that you perform on a corpse and Molly is a perfectly healthy living animal. - We don't know what caused the miscarriage. - Are you suggesting a vivisection? On what grounds? - It's in our interest to find out. It also eliminates any element of contagion. - We have no evidence of contagion. - Well, how can you say that when you don't even know what caused it? I mean, it was monkeys that brought Ebola into America, right? - Oh, Ebola now. - Uh, but really this also sees Molly removed from our sample group and that way our response rates would go right back up. - Which is clearly your whole point, because then you'd be back on schedule for your drug patent. - Well, it's in your interest as well, Doctor. - Get out. (tense music) - You should think about this. (tense music) You look like a fit kind of guy, hmm? We've got a full gym here, a spa. Lap pool, it's heated. Of course. Sauna, steam room, the like. You see, an office on the top floor means more than a key to the executive washroom. Let me tell you, a lot more. But you get one of them, too. (keys jangling) (tense music) - I just don't know that I'm, um, qualified. I mean, I'm not... I don't have any administrative skills or experience-- - Oh, you think Anne Harriman does? I mean, Jesus, she's never here. You'd think if you're taking home her paycheck you'd be putting in some decent hours, wouldn't you? - Oh, of course, I do. I would, of course. - That's all we ask. (tense music) Some view from up here, huh? (lighter flicks) - Okay, so you're sure there isn't a brand name with those letters? I mean, a Russian tool manufacturer's brand, say, on a wrench? A wrench, Mr. Antonoff, you know, like um, fix a drain. No, no, a drain. - So, how are things in the stiff squad? Glamor wearing off? - Um, (chuckles) look, never mind, Mr. Antonoff. Thanks very much, I appreciate it. Okay. - How come everyone's so happy today? - Bloody imprint on the murder weapon. Newtown rapist. Some kind of bloody useless Slavic tool brand no one's ever heard of. - Oh, you know what they say mate. A lousy detective always blames his tool. - Ah, hello, Mrs. Rustasky. This is Detective-- (guys laughing) Shut up, Kodotis. Oh, no, no! No, not you, Mrs. Rustasky, no, no, sorry. - [Kodotis] Except I thought maybe somebody might like to know that whoever this Russki lover is, he's not your crook. - Oh, yeah, why's that? - 'Cause this ain't Russian. It's Greek! - Look, sorry, Mrs. Rustasky, could I call you back? Sorry. - Bullshit. We checked. Greek's got an O thingy with a line like this, not with the line down. Only Russian's got that. - Yeah, yeah, forget about the alphabet degree, mate, if you hold it like this everybody in Greece knows this sign. - [Dave] What does it mean? - [Kodotis] You ever hear of Theodorakis? Big shipping family. Mega-rich, tankers, freighters, you name it. That's the family crest. It's on all their ships. - [Taylor] Are you sure about this? - [Kodotis] Yeah, I grew up with this. (tense music) - Don't look so stricken, Tom, it's not you on trial. We have to tell those stuffed shirts what we know. The truth shall set him free. (tense music) - [Peter] She was happy, we both were, so I kissed her back. - [Man] On the mouth? - [Peter] I don't actually remember. - Let's see if this jogs your memory. "He kissed me hard and I could feel his tongue "trying to enter my mouth. "At the same time, his hand squeezed my bottom. "I tried to pull back, but he kept holding me like that." Well. - I can't believe... Did Grace actually say that? - [Man] That's the statement we received, yes. And we'd rather you don't mention the name of the victim. She won't be called before this hearing and her anonymity has to be protected. - As opposed to the anonymity of the accused. - [Man] Can we just stay on the subject, please? Did you or did you not embrace, kiss on the mouth, and fondle the buttocks of a female student at approximately 6 p.m. on the 12th of May? - I've known Peter MacFarlane for 22 years. - And have you ever heard of his harassment of females during that time? - I've probably heard every rumor about every man, woman, and child that has ever come onto this-- - That wasn't the question, Doctor. The question was have you heard any accounts of Peter MacFarlane sexually harassing any females on this campus? - Define harassment. - Unwanted advances. Remarks, physical contact. - How does one know in advance it's unwanted until one has made it? Well? - So, is that a yes, Doctor? (tense music) - Have they started? - Oh, yes. - Have you been in? - Mm-hmm. - Well, you said only good things about him, didn't you? - They're not interested in good things. - This is an impossible situation. Peter MacFarlane is being asked to defend himself against phantom accusers who are required to offer nothing in the way of proof. Now, their word is given total credibility, his is given none. - The guidelines for the sexual discrimination code clearly-- - Discrimination is right. Because these phantom accusers are women it's assumed that they're telling the truth. And because Peter is a man, he is guilty until proven innocent. Now, this would be totally unacceptable in any court in the world and I think it's a travesty it's accepted here. (tense music) They're all yours. - I won't be testifying. - Why the hell not? - I can't. Oh, you know why. - Dr. Ferrars. - I won't be appearing. - [Man] And you've nothing to say? Nothing in support of Peter MacFarlane? (tense music) - [Tom] I can't be seen to take sides and I have to live with these people. - [Anne] Oh, I have to live with myself. - [Tom] Oh, don't start laying claim for the moral high ground here, Anne. - (laughs) Well, after that little display. - Christ, you're so bloody self righteous. Ever since... You're not always so uncompromised yourself, you know? - Oh? - Look at your own life. You're not her. - Who? - Giselle. You're trying to be her. You can't be her and yourself at the same time. - You're saying that in order for me to be more like myself I should stand back and let Peter be destroyed? - No. No, of course I'm not. You do what you can, but we don't torture ourselves trying to do things we can do nothing about or everybody else around us. The system is there for a reason. - Oh, yours maybe, not mine. - It works. (tense music) (van rumbling) - I didn't want to disturb you if Tom was with you. - Oh, well, as you can see, he is conspicuously absent. - Because of me. - No. Nope. Lots of things. - I just wanted to thank you for standing up for me at that witch hunt. (scoffs) Had this overwhelming urge to stand up and shout, "I saw Goody Proctor with the devil!" Being branded the arch-molester is almost less painful than dealing with the truth. I was so deluded I actually believed a girl like that could find me attractive. It's pathetic, isn't it? - Well, about as pathetic as a woman who believes she's doing something worthwhile and noble, when instead she's just getting rich working for slime bags. Or Nazis, as Giselle would say. - You know why she gave you so much grief about your life, don't you? - Yeah. She disapproved. - Because she loved you. - Well, we're a pair, aren't we? - Didn't used to be like this. - How did we get here? (melancholy music) (radio static buzzes) (melancholy music) - [Girl] Come on, Mum. - [Woman] I know, darling. Look, Penny, just give me a moment and I'll get it. (melancholy music) - Sarge? - What've you got? - Okay, these are all the shipping movements in and out of the harbor for the past year. - [Dave] Christ, no wonder all the fish are dead. - I rang up Theodorakis' office down at the docks. They're gonna fax me the names of all their ships that sail here and I can get the dates off this. They got all cagey when I said we wanted to know about the ships, so I think they're afraid we're from customs or something. Anyway, I told them I met a bloke who told me he was on one of their ships, couldn't remember his name, but I wanted to try to catch up with him next time he came to town. - (chuckles) You're a talent, Taylor. Good work. I'm going home. If Anne Harriman calls, tell her we're getting close. (tense music) - The ship's called the Elena, a 37000 ton mixed cargo carrier. It left port between 5:30 and seven the morning after every assault, including Giselle McKenzie. In fact, 5:45 that time. So our man waits till the last possible minute, makes his hit, and then he's gone. That's the only ship that matches the murder times. He's got to be on it. So what we've got here is an organized recreational predator. Probably young, mid-twenties, but there's an outside chance he could be late forties, could be suffering a midlife stress psychosis. Works with his hands, flexible hours. He's had time to stalk most of these women. He blends in, he's fastidious, intelligent, territorial. He staked his claim on the uni and he's not leaving. - Any tips on how to catch this bastard? - [Taylor] Well, he's a creature of habit, obsessed. Uh, sadistic paraphernalia, they call it, so everything he does, he does the same way, loves the ritual. - Priors for rape? - No, I don't think so. He's got a problem with women, but mainly academic women. I don't know, maybe it stems back to his childhood. I reckon 10 to one he'll kill again. They call it kindling, the violence builds like a fire. The fantasy feeds on the last crime, so even if killing Giselle McKenzie was a mistake, he's gonna need to kill the next girl, just to get the same kick. - It's perfect, a body-snatcher. It binds into the victim during mitosis just as the cell divides, so it always gets two for the price of one. A predator with an eye for a bargain. Basically, it eats its guts out and lives inside its body, eventually destroying the entire colony of intestinal flora. - And without intestinal flora, Molly couldn't synthesize vitamin K. - Yep. Wouldn't matter how many vitamin supplements you gave her, her body couldn't convert it. - And without vitamin K, her blood wouldn't clot. She hemorrhaged and miscarried. Give me a look. We created this? - [Wei] Looks that way. - [Anne] Is it contagious? - Not really. Can't live outside the body. I suppose if you ate the monkey raw you might get it. You're not planning to do that, are you? - Not yet. - Well, I say there's zero chance of it spreading. It's a one-off, a freak. I'd like to keep playing with it, see if I can alter it so it attacks harmful bacteria like E. Coli. - Just look after Molly for me, will you? See you later. (tense music) - [Man] So? - Plasmic vector. Negative side effect of the treatment. - Do the monkeys have it? - No. - Okay. We're in business. You know what to do. (tense music) - A parcel arrived from Paris today. They shut up her flat and the furniture's being shipped back, but her book company sent all the papers on her desk back to me, a terrible waste of money, really, Air Express. Would you like to see it? (papers rustling) (Anne sighs) (gentle music) (little girls laughing) (quiet knocking) (gentle music) - [Anne] I was eight years old when Giselle first brought me here. - [Dominic] I hope you don't mind me coming. - [Anne] No. I'm glad you did. She'd want us to be here together so she could keep an eye on us, stop us from doing the wrong thing. Selling our souls as she used to say. - [Dominic] Speaking of which, Scanlon knows we've talked. - [Anne] I think I'm beginning to understand what you've had to deal with all this time. - [Dominic] How many deals can you make before you forget what it was you set out to do? How many times can you divide yourself before there's nobody there at all? (gentle music) - Percy Travers. Hello, old man. I brought you a present. Well, it's uh, it's more of a bribe, actually. I was hoping I might be able to convince you to share digs with me. You can bore me with T.S. Eliot and I'll bore you with Russian art. (chuckles) What do you say? (tense music) (camera snapping) - That's not Molly. Where's Molly? (camera snaps) Where's my monkey? All right, where's Wei Li Ping? (tense music) - [Wei] Salutation to the sun. - What did you do with my monkey? - The monkey with the plasmic vector? I took bloods, did an intestinal stain, a minimal gut biopsy, then gave her some dinner and went home. Looking into the mouth of the tiger. I've got a culture going in agar of your plasmic vector. I had a quick look at it's codes. I'm confident we'll get it to attack E Coli. Yep, looks like you've won the lottery. - Well, where is Molly now? - Back in her cage in your lab. One of your researchers took her. If you want to look at the sample slides and the culture, he's got them, too. - Which researcher? - Dr. Kerr. Why? (tense music) - [Man] Was it our treatment that caused the miscarriage? - A contamination of our treatment. So we can remove Molly from our response rate survey. - So, mission accomplished. I'll proceed with our patent application immediately. - The vivisection illuminated one other thing. The monkey's ovaries, well, this is quite remarkable. They are without exaggeration, absolutely perfect. If this is the condition we can get all the essential organs in at this age, my God. The life expectancy of a human on this treatment would have to be close to 200 years. - But there was this thing about the buffer zone collapsing and, uh, massive disease? - The telemeter collapse. We could eradicate that, I'm sure. The University of Texas had a recent breakthrough on that, but our research has been solely on disease prevention. (man speaking foreign language) - Why have we spent millions figuring out how to save the lives of a handful of kids when we're sitting on a goldmine like this which could add years to anyone's life? - Because it's right. Morally. It's the right thing to do. - Right or wrong is irrelevant and not for us to decide. - Oh, but you are deciding. - We're just a company with a duty to our shareholders. - Well, with this treatment everyone is gonna be so healthy you're gonna go out of business. (man speaking foreign language) - What makes you think everyone could afford it? - Oh, I see. Two lifetimes of perfect health for the rich. And for the poor? - Whatever they can afford. - That's obscene. - That's good business. - It's grotesque and immoral! - [Man] It's legal. - You do this and I'll resign. - It would be a mistake to turn your back on this. - [Anne] Auf wiedersehen. (older man speaking foreign language) - Keep your people in mind, Dominic. I don't want that woman opening her mouth again. - This is bullshit. No one is buying it. You have to give me something. Give me the income tax! - I don't have to do anything. - If I don't fight you and win something, they're going to start asking questions. - [Scanlon] Fine. Give it to him. - I'm sorry. Perhaps some of us misunderstood this little menage a trois. I am the one doing the screwing. Monsieur Martin here is the one getting screwed and you, Paul, are merely the lubricant. - [Dominic] You little French-- - Calm down, calm down. Don't screw it up. You just stick to your yes, sir, no, sir, three bags full, sir, and you and your people might just come out of this with something to show. And for Christ's sake, don't say anything around that bitch Harriman. - Dominic. Here, I want you to sign this. - Well, what is it? - This is a petition. We want to name the accord after Giselle McKenzie. Here, sign it now. Before the press conference. - Press conference? - Raitea and I have called one to tell them about this. This is a good thing to do for a good woman. The McKenzie Declaration. (pen scrawling) - Our offender has struck every time between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., so we're gonna give him a margin of error each way from 9:30 to 2:30. Now, we gotta remember he knows he was seen by two people last time, which could change his pattern. It might mean he's got the butterflies, won't show at all. - It could make him bolder. - Psych people say he might've loved the rush of it, terrifying two people, not just one. Plus, in his wonderful little mind, he might feel like he's owed one. - Christ. - Anyway. Taylor's volunteered to be the target. She will trawl in this direction while we have the mobile base here. I want Anderson and Frankel in civvies here and here. Try and dress down like uni types, guys. - Um, what's your ETA from the base to the furthest point I'll be trawling? - Three minutes, max. But I can get someone to tail you if you-- - No, no, could spook him. Three minutes is okay. - The rapist knows this place very well. He sees anything unusual, he will bolt. This has to look like a normal, quiet night. That's it, then. We travel from here at 7:30 tonight. (tense music) (man whistles) (men speaking in foreign language) (tense music) (gate creaks and bangs shut) (tense music) - (quietly) Taylor to mobile, all clear. - Yeah, copy that, Suze. Move on down to sector eight. Slow and easy. (papers rustling) (dramatic music) - [Woman] Where are the records for the fingerprints on the car phone? (computer beeps) - He has this gun to my head. - [Man] This could be very damaging. - [Dominic] So my vote will go whichever way he wants. (tense music) - Ladies and gentlemen. The final vote in the central question of this accord. The people of French Polynesia have entrusted you, their elected delegates, with the future of an entire nation. History will remember you for this moment. - [Woman] Can we finish up? I've got somewhere to go. - [Man] Yeah, sure. You coulda gone before. (tense music) - Do you, the people of French Polynesia, wish to terminate the protectorate of France and forgo any and all assistance and aid previously endowed by France? A simple majority will carry the resolution. (bus rumbling) (ticket machine beeps) (tense music) (bus rumbling) Monsieur De Grasset, Le Alliance Colonial. How do you vote? - No. - [Scanlon] Monsieur Tenardier for the Patriot Party. How do you vote? - No. (tense music) - [Taylor] Moving east from eight to seven. I'll do another swing counterclockwise. - [Dave] Copy that. - [Scanlon] Monsieur Raitea. (Scanlon speaks foreign language) - Yes, I vote yes. - [Scanlon] Monsieur Martin, for Ta Rapi. Monsieur Martin? - Mr. Chairman, is it possible under the terms of this accord for me to abstain from casting a vote? (people chattering) - No! The vote is compulsory! It says clearly that everybody-- - Monsieur De Grasset. (people chattering) All delegates must vote, Monsieur Martin. - This is very difficult for me. Many of you have been surprised that I have pursued such a conservative, some say a moderate line in this accord. I would like to explain the reasons why. (bus rumbling) (tense music) 20 years ago, a young woman was killed. I was charged with her murder. (people murmuring) I have never been cleared of these charges, but for 20 years, I have been afraid that someone would use this charge against me and this is what has happened. (people clamoring) (gavel banging) - Order! (tense music) (branch cracks nearby) - (quietly) Code two. - Yep. Yeah, Suze. Try and lead him in this way, nice and easy. Nice and easy, okay? - It is not important who these men are, because they are not important men. They used my fear to make me compromise and then to completely betray the trust of my people and for this, I thank them. Because they made me see. To choose a path from fear is to be a slave of fear. I will face whatever comes and I know one day I will be free. People of Teyauma Ohi vote yes with me to end the poison reign of France! (crowd clapping) (suspenseful music) (crowd clamoring) - [Scanlon] Order! (gavel banging) Order! - Mr. Chairman! I register a protest, Mr. Chairman. - On what grounds? - This man has just admitted he's a murderer! - I did not! - Well he has admitted that a charge of murder hangs over him. He should not be allowed to vote at these talks. - I asked to abstain. You yourself insisted I must vote. Perhaps you would like to explain why. (crowd murmuring) (tense music) - It is your hands, Mr. Chairman. (crowd murmuring) (tense music) - I suppose the uh, circumstances are extraordinary. (Anne clears throat) In Australia, we operate under a rule of law. Which means a man is innocent until proven guilty. I see no reason why this vote should not proceed. - I vote yes! Yes, yes! (crowd cheering) - [Scanlon] That's enough! - Mr. Chairman, I-- (crowd cheering) (glasses shatter) (dramatic music) - [Reporter] Mr. Martin! Mr. Martin! - [Reporter] Who was this woman who was murdered? (crowd clamoring) - Look, just patch me through to him. It's an emergency, please. Look, just do it now. (mobile ringing) - Gutteridge. - It's Anne. - [Dave] Uh, not a good time. - Was the first girl wearing glasses? - [Dave] What? - The first girl who was attacked, was she wearing glasses? - Oh, Christ, I don't know. Um, yeah, I think she was. That's right, she got upset 'cause they got lost, yeah. - No. They didn't get lost, he collects them. That's the missing link. That was, that was what was bugging me. They all wore glasses. - No, no, Giselle McKenzie wasn't. - No, she was. I found some fragments of curved glass that I couldn't quite place, I-- - Shit. All right, I'll get Taylor in and we'll get a pair on her. Thanks, Anne. (mobile beeps off) - Mobile to Taylor. (tense music) (radio static buzzing) - Taylor to base. I thought I heard something, but it's a no show. - Yeah. Bring it home, we may have done this wrong. - [Taylor] Copy that. (suspenseful music) (knocking on van) - [Man] Hey. - Hey. You going to the library? - [Man] Sure. (suspenseful music) - [Woman] Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. - This is a police operation you're interfering with. Step away from the vehicle, don't speak, don't say a word. Just turn around and keep moving. - This is a tow-away-- - Do you like your job? You want to have it in the morning? Then piss off! (van door slams) - [Woman] Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. - I'm coming over! - There's no point, Anne, there's nothing for you to see. - [Woman] Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God. (bell tolling) (girl screaming) - Code three. Code three! Direction O'Connell Gate. - Follow me to section eight, guys! Go, go, go, go! Come on! Move it! (glasses clink) (man grunts) (man roars) - No! (wrench clatters) (Taylor and man grunting) - Taylor! Hold on, Taylor! Don't move! Don't move! Drop it, drop it! Drop it! Drop it, boy! Drop that wrench! Drop it now! (wrench clatters) Get him in the van. (man grunting) (handcuffs clicking) (dramatic music) (siren blaring nearby) (dramatic music) - Can I see her? - Oh, it's okay, she's gonna be fine. - I should be in there. - Well, it's not possible, sorry. - Look, you know who I am. I'm the pathologist on the Giselle McKenzie case. - Yeah, but this isn't the McKenzie case anymore and sorry, but you're not a relative, are you? I did ask. - Where is she? - Oh, sorry, can-- - I'm her mother. - Oh, okay, come through. Oh, darling! Oh, sweetheart, are you okay? - [Girl] I'm fine, Mum. - [Woman] I was so worried. - You should go in. - [Girl] Where's Dad? - [Woman] Let me look at you. - [Girl] I'm all right, Mum. - [Woman] Come on, let's get you home. You okay? (dramatic music) (plastic apron rustling) - What are you doing here at this hour? - Overtime. Need the dosh. - Right. Of course. - What's your excuse? - The cremation's tomorrow. I just wanted to see her again. She's my only friend, after all. - Do you want me to get her for you? It's not true, by the way. - What? - She's not your only friend. (gentle music) - You'll be happy to hear they're still talking about you. Not too many people who could cause such a fuss even after they were dead. Not too funny what they're saying, though. And who have you got to stick up for you, hmm? (tapping on window) The boy's here. You have to go now. I just want to say that I saw the box of clippings. And I just want you to know that everything I've ever done, everything I've ever tried to do, all the dreams have been because of you. (gentle music) - [Mrs. McKenzie] I only waited till you got here. - Thank you. - It's what she would have wanted. (little girls laughing) Here we go, Giselle. Sail away! (gentle music) - Lots of love, my darling. Lots of love, Giselle. (gentle music) (ship's horn blowing in distance) (waves lapping gently) (dramatic music) (electronic music)
