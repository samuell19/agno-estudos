Dear April, - it's been over a year since the last time we spoke. And thanks to Robert, my modeling career- - is really taken off. I'm not so sure about a relationship. He wants to control my whole life. Sometimes, I wonder if he really loves me- - or just the money I make modeling for him. Lately, I've been thinking about Two Moon Junction. Remember when Mother would take us there- - for Sunday picnics? I wonder if Grandma Belle still has those home movies- - of Mom and me rowing around the lagoon- - and playing in front of Two Moon. I still have the music box that Mom gave me that day. You were already in high school by then, - busy with cheerleading and boys. After Mom drowned, - Nana Belle just seemed to close up inside. It was like she blamed Two Moon for Mom's accident. She wasn't very interested in me anymore, either. I guess I reminded her too much of Mom, - always so independent. I know you're still upset with me for coming to New York- - without telling anyone, but we both know Nana would not have let me go. Her birthday is next week. And I'm catching a plane after my show- - to help her celebrate. She won't be around forever, you know. Besides, I'd like to see Two Moon again. And, who knows, she might even be happy- - to see me. Maybe you could join us. We'd certainly have a lot to talk about. It's been a long time, April. I hope we'll see each other soon. Take care. Love, Savannah. ♪ Look out ♪ ♪ We're not talking ♪ Okay.

We can discuss this later. I won't be around later. - Robert? - Savannah? - Robert? - Savannah! They loved it. They're all out there waiting to tell you what a genius... Ronnie, handle her. Savannah? Savannah? Be careful, okay. He could make New York- - one hell of a black hole. Ronnie, I'll call you. Savannah, don't forget about the Saint Thomas shoot. - Thank you. - Thank you. There's something about traveling always zaps- - the life right out of you, don't it? Long time since you've been home? Yes. You ain't kin to Charlie Newman, are you? You favor him? No. Belle Delongpre? Belle Delongpre? You the model? Ha! You know my daughter gets all them magazines. Hmm. Well, then you must be April's little sister. Yes. You like New York? I've been lucky there. Well, now, look at here. Savannah Delongpre. Lord, have you have grown. Mr. Bowman, you haven't changed a bit. How are you? Well, now, tobacco don't hold the same glory it used to. - And Mrs. Bowman? - Mrs. Bowman? She don't hold the same glory, either. So, did it get here in time? Oh? Special ordered it. I special ordered it. Oh, wonderful. And the engraving? Came out perfect. Oh, thank you. She's going to love this. I'm gonna take some flowers, too. - How much? - No. Flowers for a flower. You probably don't remember me. Henry Walker. I was a friend of your Momma's. Oh? Nice to meet you. Well, Mr. Bowman, thank you so much. Now don't you be a stranger here, you here? I won't. She turned out the spitting image of her mom. Hard to believe, her being so plain. Y'all take care. - Good-bye. - Bye now. Mom's car. I don't know why I keep that old thing around. It took a week to get it out and running. Nana Belle! Um, these are for you. Store bought flowers- - are a waste of your good money, Savannah. And what's that you're wearing? Where's your luggage? Oh, they lost it. Well, then, I guess that means you'll have to get some things- - out of the back room. Come on in. You know where everything is. Dinner's at 8:00 sharp. I don't like it cold. Bean! It's so good to see you. Let me look at you. Oh, ain't you something. Oh. So glad you're here. Let's go up. Get comfortable, - relax, and I'll make us something cool to drink. How about a nice cold glass of fresh lemonade? You are a sight for sore eyes. Come over here and talk to me. I have so much to tell you. What about Mr. Lee? Is he treating you right, Bean? Oh, Ruth, I don't know about anything anymore. Are you all right? I'm just glad to be here. All right. Savannah, - if you parade around in those old things, - people are gonna say that the Delongpres- - can't afford a decent standard of living. Well, this would cost a fortune in New York. Well, that's the silliest thing I ever heard. Oh, no thank you, Ruth. Maybe just some salad. No wonder you never fill out. You're always gonna be scrawny if you don't eat something- - that sticks to your bones. I just don't know. Thank you. Thank you, Ruth. I thought maybe you'd bring Mr. Lee home- - with you this time, so I could have a proper introduction. I'm not seeing Robert anymore. Savannah, if you're not careful, you're never gonna settle. Then what will you do? I have a career, Nana. You change clothes for a living. You know, I was thinking about going- - to the summer place tomorrow. Well, I rented it. Until I sell it. You... You're selling Two Moon? I'll have my brandy on the veranda, Ruth. Please. Why are you selling it? That place has been nothing but trouble. But, Nana, she didn't... ...It was the current, not Two Moon. I just wish you'd told me. The stars are bright tonight. Oh, Ruth, I'll get it. Thank you, Ruth. - Hello? - Savannah. Savannah, don't hang up. I want to apologize. I missed you. Robert don't. I'm sorry. I was stupid. I don't know what I was thinking. I just... I just want you to come back. For Saint Thomas? No, for us. Savannah? Robert, I'm not sure there is an us anymore. When will you be back? I don't know. It's late. I got to go. Savannah, it's late. Nana Belle, come watch with me. No. It's too late for me. Don't stay up too long. Tracy's coming by tomorrow- - to go over the plans for the party. Hi. Hi, Mommy. Oh, nice. Nice shot. No mercy, huh? Come on, let's play one more time. - No. Let's get a drink. - Come on. - Gosh. - Oh! Oh, man! You know, I think I could beat you- - if you didn't look so good. Bert? So, who else was there? Uh, Remember Vaughn Woodman? In our Biology class. Hey, Bert, honey, playing so hard- - might give you a stroke. - Oh, that's good. - You're really mean, aren't you? - Yes, I am. Mm. Hey, Junior. You girls have fun, all right? - I got to run. - Bye. - Bye-bye. - So, Vaughn? - Oh, Vau... Vaughn! - The one with the, uh, - with the real long hair, right? - All right. - Always so damn proud of it? - Right. - Completely bald. No? Oh, he looks so pathetic. - Oh, gosh. - So, you two are happy? Oh, yeah. Of course, we are. So, let's see here now, we've got the... ...we got the wine. We got the hors d'oeuvres. The music? There is a string quartet I use a lot. Oh, you know what? I don't think she's gonna want to go for some big fuss. - You know how she is? - Oh, sure. Sure. My whole damn life. Boy this heat is getting to me. You know what? I don't miss it. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! The baby just kicked. - What? Oh, oh, okay. - Put your hand and feel that. Oh! You got a future linebacker in there. Now, see, if he's a boy, we're gonna make him a junior- - 'cause Bert likes that. - Bert junior. Foyer's full of roses from Mr. Lee. - Oh, you're kidding? - Hmm. Oh, aren't you just Miss Lucky. See, now, McDonalds is about as romantic as Bert gets. Oh. Do you mind if we finish this up tomorrow? I... Oh, no. No. Besides. My feet are real swollen... - Okay. - ...and junior, here, - she's getting restless. Oh, Here. Let me help. Let me help. Okay. Are you leaving? Oh, just for a little bit. I hope you're not going out there. I'm a big girl, Nana. So was your mother. I'll be fine. Savannah? Slothfulness is not a virtue, Savannah. Did you know the foyer- - is full of roses? - I know. I wish he'd leave me alone. Well, you know the proper thing to do- - is just call him and thank him. I'm not ready to talk to him yet. Every blossom fades, Savannah. Don't think you won't. Henry Walker is here and you're going with him- - to the charity event instead of your grandma. What? What are you... Her leg is acting up again. Well, tell me, how's your cousin Freddie? - He's doing better. - I don't believe it. Nana, could I speak to you for a moment, please? Savannah, get dressed. You'll keep the Dawson's waiting. I'm sorry. I thought... Well, you knew Henry'd be here. Hurry up. I'll be just a minute. Take your time. She's lovely. Race. Whoa! We made the first heat. Great. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be bored. I doubt you play much croquette in New York. No grass. You know, I know you're here because of your grandmother. Well, she does have a way of getting her way. Oh, don't I know it. You know, it took all my powers of persuasion to get her- - to rent out Two Moon after having it on the market- - for a good year. - That long? - Yes, sir. So, it wouldn't be just standing still- - eating up property tax. Mm. You know, it's just too out of the way. Oh. Too big to heat. You know, people want efficiency these days, not charm. Who's renting it? Salvage company. Probably for storage. They want to lease to buy. Finally get it out of my hair if the bank approves them. Oh, I'd hate to see it sold. I just wish Nana had told me. Why? Are you interested? Thought about it. Well, you know the bank would rather deal with you. I mean, you're absolutely no risk. If you want, I can talk to Bob Fisher? Okay. That'd be nice. My pleasure. - Thanks for going. - Thanks for taking me. It would have been polite to invite him in. I've been polite all day. Who are you? The guy who pays the rent. Who the hell are you? The guy you pay the rent to. I pay old Lady Delongpre. I'm Savannah Delongpre. You manage a salvage company? Something like that. Let me guess. You're just out here slumming? No. I'm here to tell you this isn't for rent anymore. I'm buying it. I'm sure you like throwing your weight around- - with the peasants, - but I got a lease to buy going through. You're too late. My family's had a fortune in that bank for years. I doubt it. And before you leave, I want all this stuff- - out of here. So, she said, - "That's not a pig, that's a dog." And I said Lady I was talking to the dog. Oh. - I'm tired. - Guess you had to be there. - Ready? - Get going. Yeah. Yeah. You drive? - Thank you for having us. - Thanks for coming. - Thanks for having us. - [Bell] I wish you'd come more. I think we're gonna have to do that. - Bye, honey. - Come here. Thanks. - Thanks. Thanks. - Are you okay? I'm great. I mean, she's almost like this every single solitary time- - I'm in this house, now why's it getting to you tonight? Oh, it's not that. It's just... Well, I had this run in with the most irritating man today. - Oh, really? Where? - Two Moon. Got me in a mood. Uh-huh. And what were you doing out there? He was so arrogant, he actually thinks- - he's gonna buy the place. And you should see... - Oh, yeah? - ...what he's done to it. - He's got all this stuff. - I bet he was cute. It was like his personal junk yard. - Bet he was cute. - Tracy? You're going on too much about it for him to be ugly. - Really? - Umm-hmm. You are. I'll call you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. Nothing ever changes in this town. Excuse me. I have an appointment. Yeah. I just had one. When your great grandfather cheated mine- - out of Two Moon, he just didn't take Two Moon. He took his whole life when he took that place. Yes, ma'am, I did. I just filed it... Did Great Grandpa cheat Warren Gilbert- - out of the title to Two Moon? It's unladylike to burst in a room like that, Savannah. Did he? I have one nerve left, Savannah, and you're on it. I want to know. Who have you been talking to? Warren Gilbert's great grandson. Warren Gilbert was an uncivilized animal. I don't care what he was like! Did we still the property? There was a gentlemanly dispute about the property lines. But that's ancient history. And no need to drag it up now. And us having more money, the court listened better? Savannah? This place isn't yours, yet. You still got to knock. That swan used to be out front before a hurricane came through. I used to think it got tired of being here and flew away. What do you want? You know you're wasted here. You should go to New York. This is beautiful. I don't give a shit about New York. And unless you're here to personally kick me out... I'm sorry about my grandfather. I didn't know. You're gonna have a hell of a battle on your hands- - when you try to take this place. I'm not an easy mark like my grandfather was. That's not what this is about. We're not our grandparents. We are who we are. Look. Forget it. I came here to apologize but just forget it. Where do you come off being so arrogant? I went out of my way to find out if what you said was true. Hey, girl. Ha-ha. Ronnie. Girlfriend. Woo! - My luggage. - Well, you did ask. Now, I can't believe you are getting along- - without all your shit. You'd be surprised. Come on, let's get you settled. Savannah running around at all hours by yourself- - is asking for trouble. People talk. What do you do around here? Watch the cars rust? God, Ronnie, I'm so glad you're here. You know, Robert's been a major pain in the ass- - since you left him. You know, I got to find out- - what you people put in grits. You look relaxed. Oh, God, Ronnie. Woo! Shit! What's his name? Shh! Did you already? You slut. I want to know every disgusting detail. Oh, yeah. He's got this great art. I want you to check it out. Is that your... talking or your ass? Did you sleep good? Oh, yeah, great. Cricket symphony going in the background. Remind me to get some bug spray. Ooh. Must be your perfume. You mean the one you gave me? Umm-hmm. So? So? Is this it? You Southerner's are some weird ass birds. Fuck you, Ronnie. I like it. I just might stay. Whoa. Whoa, girl. Reality check, okay? Robert's got you booked for Christmas. Screw Robert. I don't get paid enough for that. Whoa! I like it. Have I ever seen this before? Has he ever had a show? I don't think so. What are you doing? Ronnie has some friends who run some galleries- - and I... I was thinking that maybe... I'm not interested. Little tense, are we? Look, I was just thinking... Jake, I hope you realize how good you are- - and you can blow the critics away with this. You're in to all that, not me. Don't try to drag me down to some higher social level. That's not what I'm doing. Okay, okay. I'm gonna go outside- - and play with the crawdads or something. I'm sorry. I didn't realize... Take a look around, okay? This is it. This is me. I know that. I know that. What are you doing? - What was last night about? - I'm not sure. Are you? I don't think you mean that. I said I was sorry. We're having a party tomorrow and I want you to come. What? Are you turning trader on me? A Gilbert's never been behind Delongpre line. I thought we were past all that? Starts at 4:00. He reminds me of this rapper I used to date. MC Ice Pick. I think his songs were so good because he was such an asshole. Law of proportion, girl. Oh. I'm sorry he was so rude. I don't know what's wrong with him today. He lives in the middle of the fucking woods, - that's what's wrong with him. You realize this could just be a rebound thing. Yeah. I know. Watch your step, girls. Ooh! What's so funny in here? Stop all that laughing. No more fun. Savannah and Belle, I want to get a picture of you- - cause I got my camera. I need a new picture. Can you just stand up- - because I want to get the sunlight coming in, - so I can catch it on your pretty face. Belle, I want to get a picture of you and Savannah, - so could you two stand up together. Yeah. There we go. Let's get this in the frame. Savannah could you move a little bit closer to Belle. I did want to just take one picture- - that was the idea. Okay. Belle, could you just put your arm around Savannah there- - so we can... Just put your arm around. There you go. Smile pretty for the camera. Say cheese. Ah, that is a beautiful picture. Excuse me. - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing here? I just couldn't let it go that easily. Robert, don't you have a show? Savannah, you're more important than any show. How nice of you to come. - My pleasure. - Lovely to see you. You don't understand I haven't been alone here. Belle? Excuse me, love. Can you come here a second? They've had heat between them for a lot of years- - and they always end up back on each other's doorstep. They're cut the same. Gilberts have no place in this house. I can see that. - Come back with me. - I'm not ready. So, where is he today? - This has nothing to do with him. - You're right. It was just your way of getting back at me. Making me jealous. It worked. Robert? You know you're mine. You don't belong with anyone. I'm not a piece of furniture. - No. I know. I didn't mean that. - Yes, you did. You did. Look. I have to get back. ♪ For she's ♪ ♪ A jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For she's ♪ ♪ A jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For she's ♪ ♪ A jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ Did I see you with Robert? - Savannah? - Henry, hi. Is everything okay? You look like you're waiting for someone? Well, I... I thought I was, - but I guess not. Oh, Savannah Delongpre, Chelsy Parker. It's nice to meet you. I hope you're taking good care of him. Excuse me. He brought this tonight. Why didn't he stay? - He's a Gilbert. - That's not my fault. It's not his, either. And besides, he saw you entertaining another gentleman. If you love him, honey, don't wait. There's too much waiting done around here. Where do you think you're going? You can't stop me from seeing him. Savannah? - What do you want? - I didn't know you were there. That's right. You were busy. Oh, Jake, don't do this. Don't shut me out. - It's over with him. - Didn't look over. You don't understand. Listen. - Yeah. I do. - No. Yes. You and he come from the same place. - You're cut the same. - That's bullshit. - Listen to me. - No. You listen to me. I don't need this crap. Remember what happened last time you tried to throw me out? Yeah. You don't have to worry about that happening. Why is it this place is always breaking my heart? Oh, shit. Oh. You. Come on. I'm starving. When is it ready? Stop it. Stop it. - You can't rush an omelet. - Okay. - Hi. - Good morning. I had no idea you were so good - in the kitchen. - I'm serious. Come here. Come here. I can see that. I can see that. So, I'll just sit over here. - Yeah. - That's it. I'll sit over here by myself. See, cooking's an art, you know. It's a science. It's not an art, it's a science. What? Savannah, this is almost ready. - I know. - Savannah, I'm not kidding. - You're not kidding? - I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. - Oh, it's burning. - What's burning? - It's burning. - Shit. You look damn good doing it. Oh! Smell these vegetables. You can't get this in New York. Hey-hey! Catch. Catch. - What's that? - It's a kite. I don't believe that's gonna be a problem. Yes, Sir. Let me get back to you. - Mr. Lee? - Henry. It's real good to see you- - again, sir. - How are you? I had a real good time at the party. Henry, I must compliment you- - on your town here. It's quite beautiful. - Hmm. - A little quiet, but... What would you say- - the population is? - The pop... Well, we're growing so much you wouldn't believe it. Hey, is this as fast you can go? I'm doing all the work here. Yes, sir. She's, uh... - She's lovely. - I bet everyone was watching you- - when you walked in with her, huh? - Well, yes. - Felt nice, didn't it? Mr. Lee, uh, I've known Savannah- - all her life. In fact, I was friend of her mama. You had a good time, though, didn't you? Mr. Lee, while you're here, I believe you could be interested- - in some development property work down by the river- - where we're getting ready to make some good money on it. - Henry? - Hmm? You trying to sell me some swampland there? - Well... - Joking. Was there something you wanted, Mr. Lee? I'd like to buy you lunch, Henry. Come here. Delongpre residents. Uh, this is Henry Walker. May I speak with Savannah, please. She isn't in. But it's a... it's real important I speak with her. It's regarding an offer of Two Moon. I'll give her your message. When do you expect her back? I'd say she's gonna be tied up for a while. Fine. Go! Go! Go! - Oh, we got it! - Go! Go! Oh, no! Oh! Okay. Nice job. All right. Nice job. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, ready? - Here you go. - Hut. Yes. I've never shown these to anybody before. This is Two Moon. My dad brought me here when I was little. I knew I had to come back. There is just something about this place. Jake, you could work in New York. - I don't think so. - Why not? Jake, you're good. You're really good. I don't know about good. I don't know if it's about that. I was in New York about five years ago. I had the loft in the Village, the trendy agent. Everything. Then I started making these hideous hip pieces- - I hated it. Then I didn't make anything at all. This place... This place saved me. Hmm. Hmm. Here. Thank you. So, who says you need a VCR? I don't know. Are we missing the playoffs? I wish... What? I wish she were here. Sometimes... ...sometimes I just wish I could talk to her. She used to talk to me all the time. Nana never talked to me. I remember the argument Nana and she had. I remember that night she walked out the door- - and she never came back. After that... ...after she drowned, - things changed. Nana, she just kept pulling more and more away. And I always thought- - that maybe one day she'd say, - "Good job, Savannah. I love you, Savannah." But she never did. I left the minute I turned eighteen. Did you find what you were looking for in New York? I thought I had. But I think I only found part of it. I promise I'll be there soon. Uh-huh. Ciao. Don't get up. Where are you going? Well, I have to straighten some things out with Robert. He does control my career. - You want me to come? - No. No. Besides, I need a new change of clothing. When are you back? I don't know. When I, uh... ...settle some things in New York with Robert, - so he doesn't screw it up with this French designer. And, actually, it's kind of boring business stuff. What? What? You expect me to just stop modeling- - just like that? I mean, it's what I do. You go back there you get sucked in that life again. Give me some credit, Jake. You'll be there, I'll be here. This is not a big deal. I mean, this is what we have planes for. I can visit you, you'll visit me. I can't go back to that. Jake, - don't make me make a decision like this. I think you already have. I love you. Good morning. Your grandma isn't up too much of anything today. Says the party did her in. Why don't you take it in to her. Thank you. I left you a package. Did you get it? I don't need a new cane, Savannah. This is so good. Mm. That really hit the spot. Mm. Now, that looks good. - You want some? - No. I already feel like Mrs. Mack truck. I don't need more. So, what's going on with you and Jake? I haven't seen much of you. I could always use- - a little vicarious thrill. - Oh, well, he's great. - It's great. - Uh-hmm. But? But what? Well, there's always a but in there. But what? He picks his toenails after, or he's a pathological liar? - No. - There's always a but- - after all the heavy breathing stops. He doesn't want me to go to New York. Uh-hmm. But what do you want? Him. Both. Oh, right. And I want Ed McMahon to come to my door- - and give me a check for a million dollars. No, seriously, this is different. Uh-hmm. Oh, Lord, I heard that one before. That does look good. - I don't need anymore. - Sure. Have it. Go ahead. - No. I shouldn't. I shouldn't. - Yeah. - You don't mind? - No. Okay. Savannah, I have been trying to get a hold of you. Oh? Well, I've been staying out at the summer place. - Seems to be agreeing with you. - It is. It is. - I wish I'd known. - Well, nobody did really. Are you okay? I'm sorry, Savannah. The bank wouldn't wait. You didn't pursue the deed. Oh, that's okay. That's what I stopped by to tell you. I'm not buying Two Moon anymore. I want Jake to have it. Well, they refused his loan. And Mr. Lee made such a good offer. - What? - Well, I told your grandmother. You talked to her? Well, I tried to get to you. Now, I had to let her know about Mr. Lee's offer. And then she didn't seem to think you were interested- - in the property anymore and she wouldn't wait. Well, I'll just go talk to my grandmother- - and to the bank. - I'm sorry, Savannah. Paper's already signed. - She's not here. - I know. She's okay? Nothing happened? She's okay. I already told you, I'm not interested in New York. That's not why I'm here. Then why are you here? This is his wedding gift to her. Robert bought Two Moon. She said she was going to New York. She is. With him. They'll vacation here between shows. He's giving you two weeks to vacate. The hell he is. - Where's Jake? - He's already gone. You helped Robert buy Two Moon. He can make or break me, Savannah. It's just business. Is it? - Where is she? - She isn't in. Ruth. Is there anything else of Savannah's? I think you have taken it all, Mr. Lee. Thank you, Ruth. She's better off with me. Oh really? Is that why she's coming back to New York? She's going back for the modeling. You really think she'll last out here- - for more than a week? She was confused. She was just trying to get back at me. I don't believe that. Believe it, pal. She speaks three languages. She's gonna own New York in a year. Do you really think that you're enough for her? Come on... Haven't you figured it out yet? You were just a distraction. Oh, absolutely. I was thinking two weeks she'd be ready for. - Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. - What the hell do you think- - you're doing? - Look. We'll be back- - in a few days. Let's talk logistics then, okay? She looks great. We'd love to. Okay, ciao. - Cleo has a new design for you. - I don't care about Cleo. I don't think you mean that? You bought Two Moon. For you. As a wedding gift. Savannah, I know you want your independence. And this other guy... Forget about him. Robert, it doesn't work. It has never worked. Give me another chance. Maybe we should just say goodbye now. I made you. I made myself. Savannah? Savannah? Savannah? Maybe I shouldn't be with your agency anymore. Savannah? Savannah? You will regret this. Don't tell me about regrets. I'm not stiff and cold- - and locked up in a big empty house- - with no one to love. I won't listen to you talk like that. You won't listen to anything. You won't feel anything. I've waited for years for you to look at me and smile- - as if you were happy to see me. Well, I'm not gonna wait anymore. My mother did not drown on purpose. And you can go on blaming her and hating me- - because I remind you of her all you want. But don't count on me to be around for it. Flight's at 8:00. We'll be arriving back in the 20th century. Thank God, in time for a late dinner- - where we don't have to worry about anyone seeing you all. I want you to talk to her. You talk to her, Robert. I think I've already done enough. Don't give up on her. I haven't. She's given up on me. One of these days you're gonna stop letting people go. That is, if the good Lord let's you live long enough- - to realize you've been wrong. You may have lost your true love, - but Savannah doesn't have to lose hers. I told Mr. Lee I want Two Moon back. I don't want it. Savannah, when I first saw Jake, I couldn't believe- - how much he looked like his granddaddy Luke. Look. I don't want to talk about what the Gilberts did or Jake. Besides, it doesn't matter, he's gone. Savannah, wait. I loved Luke Gilbert with all my heart. We used to meet out at Two Moon. His daddy owned it. It was the only place we could go and be alone. His daddy and my daddy just hated each other. I never did know why. When they found out we were seeing one another, - my daddy wanted to send me away to school, - and his daddy told him he'd kill him if he ever stepped foot near me again. Did you? We just couldn't be apart. Luke was waiting for me at the bridge one night. But his daddy must have followed him- - because by the time I got there, they were having- - a terrible fight. Luke was yelling about me. And his daddy was hitting him every time he said my name. He was hurt so bad. Savannah, - if I've been hard on you, - it's because you're so much like your mother- - and so like me and I was afraid- - that what happened to her would happen to you. She drowned because of the current, Nana. It was an accident. It would please me so much if you would stay- - and have dinner with me tonight. Incredibly frantic. And sometimes we'd have up to ten changes- - in less than a half... In less than a half hour. And rushing, you know, two minutes to change- - completely different styles. Oh, it's just. Well, I don't know. Need help? Oh. No. Thanks. I just... What time's the train? Um, at 8:00. - It's a nice ride to Atlanta. - Yeah. And he's a great designer. I think it's gonna be a good show. - I'm glad you stayed. - Me too. Okay. I love you, Nana Belle. I love you, darling. Now you be careful. Thank you. ...Birmingham, Houston, Atlanta. I missed you. Did you miss me? Do you know how long it takes to get to Atlanta? It takes about an hour and a half, sir.
