Hey, driver! - Oh, happy Easter, Excellency. - What is it you want, Stepan? Could you ask General Bounine to come here immediately? Isn't it too late for the Church to save that master of yours? 25 francs. - No. Ten. - On Easter night? 20. - 15, Excellency. - All right, Stepan. Happy Easter to you. - Please hurry. - Leave it to me. It's very urgent. Please. Look, Bob. Don't you adore Russian food? Faster! Faster! Faster! - General, I'm just mad for your place. - It's always a pleasure to see you here. General Bounine, my husband. Excuse me, General. The Count Beresoff is outside in his taxi. He has a message. - From Stepan? - Yes. He says it is urgent. I'll be right out. Will you forgive me forjust a moment? - Is she here? - Yes, sir. - Where? - Over there, by the tree. - Are you sure? - Yes, Excellency. All right, wait here. Happy Easter. Happy Easter, Anna Koreff. It is Anna Koreff. Or at least so you were called in the asylum at St-Cloud. - You see the resemblance? - No more than 100 women might have. There's nothing to fear. Why do you always run away? Always questions. I've lost the answers. Perhaps if you hadn't told a nun who you were... - Who am I? - Grand Duchess Anastasia, I believe. In an asylum, a nun might be mad. It's contagious. Then you do admit you were in that asylum, don't you? Stepan, are you positive she is the same woman you saw in St-Cloud? - Yes, sir. - Come on. Let me go. Please let me go. The General said to wait for him at the usual place. Wait? How do you like that? The nerve of that Bounine. - Didn't he leave a message? - He said he'd be back shortly. Late. Always late. - Petrovin, the hour has arrived for me to... - I know. You only tell me what you're going to tell Bounine. Still, be happy now. - In one week, you shall be telling it in prison. - Petrovin, I forbid that word. I didn't hear it. It's the logical end to a ridiculous scheme. Ridiculous scheme, eh? But your eyes lit up like those of a mad monk when you heard our Tsar's daughter might be alive. Yours lit up when you heard he had a ?10,000,000 inheritance. Equally ridiculous. Not equally. The ?10,000,000 lie waiting in the Bank of England, but the Grand Duchess Anastasia lies buried in Russia. Vodka? No. My digestion has been shocking since Bounine decided to form our corporation. Bounine decided? The idea was mine. My years of banking experience are for nothing, huh? I devised a method of selling shares to stockholders to pay for the search for the beloved Grand Duchess. I worked out the ratio of so many shares in her inheritance to so many shares of stock. - And I advised Bounine... - I know. Bounine was nothing. Good evening, comrades - if the term doesn't grate on your White Russian ears. - Excuse me. - Oh, I'm sorry, I... - The meeting is called to order. - Just like... - The financial report. - Financial...? - Yes. - There's another report... All in due time. Go ahead, Chernov. As of today, our treasury shows assets of... yeah, exactly 5,250 francs. That new suit looks very well on you. Were there not some 9,000-odd francs at our last meeting? My dear General, may I ask you... may I ask you what paid for this club of yours? 15,000 francs from the stockholders. - We live in one room... - Two. - We share... - This is not about your housing problem. - Proceed with the accounts. - Housing problem! Um... 275 francs to Natalya Yakovski, formerly dressmaker to the imperial family, for the information on clothes and measurements. - You've made good use of the information. - I drew it myself. - The crown is a nice touch. - Yeah. A face would be a better one. It's too late. We're facing disaster. As a son of the former deacon to court, you should have more faith. I wish my poor father, bless his soul, had had less. - Chernov, please, give him the news. - I would rather have his first. - Mine? - I know that smile. I bet you have another brilliant surprise for us. Never mind. What happened, Petrovin? I was summoned by the stockholders' committee. - Oh, how kind of them. - Kind, eh? Old General Anikin came straight to the point. \x22Years ago\x22 he said \x22rumour started that the Grand Duchess Anastasia, daughter of His Imperial Majesty Nicholas II, had not been murdered with the rest of the family, but had escaped miraculously.\x22 \x22A year ago\x22 he went on \x22you and your friends came to us with the claim you knew Her Highness was somewhere in Berlin. You said you found her, but she ran away.\x22 - Was it then we used the redhead? - No, the one who giggled. - Ah, yes. The redhead came later. Go ahead. - \x22Then you needed more money to find her.\x22 \x22Again we subscribed. Then you said you found her but she was too sick.\x22 Too sick? Oh, that was Galina - too stupid. \x22How long can she be sick, Chernov? How much money can you drain from us?\x22 - How much have they got? - The joke is on us. - They give us exactly eight days. - Eight days for what? Eight days to produce the Grand Duchess Anastasia. - Or we go to prison for fraud. - For fraud! - It took them long enough. - Is that all you can say? It sickens me how you let him make you suffer, how you like to suffer. - You delight in making him suffer. - Not particularly. I thought it advisable to determine what our situation was before suggesting how to deal with it. What did I tell you? Let's have your surprise. Where is she? - Where is who? - The woman Stepan saw in the asylum. - Correct. We have finally tracked her down. - Really? - No! - She does not admit that she was there. - No? - Really? Nor does she admit she told a nun she was the Tsar's daughter. - What does she admit? - Nothing. I think she may be lying. But the important thing is that she may serve our purpose. - How? - She has certain surprising features. - Such as? - You will see. She also has a rather intriguing strangeness. That may be simply the result of amnesia. Him and his surprises! If we were looking for a grand duke, he wouldn't find so many. Stepan! Bring her in. Come over here. Don't worry, these two gentlemen are friends. Here. Sit down. How about a glass of vodka? It'll do you good. Thank you. They merely want to examine you. Examine? Are they doctors? They don't help. Doctors? No, they're not doctors. No, no. We should have kept the redhead. That tsar's daughter drinks like a Cossack. - Could I have a cigarette? - Sure. Here. - Where am I? - I told you, with friends. - Strange. - What? - The resemblance to the other. - Yes. Both female. - Did you consider what she went through? - The streets, probably. I can imagine her walk. Stand up. - What did you say? - Oh-ho-ho! I said stand up. We would like to see you walk over to there, if you please. No. At least with the redhead, we could have dyed her hair. But a walk - the Grand Duchesses learned with books on their heads. You recognised them by their carriage alone. Oh. - Stone walls. - What's she talking about? Chernov, that book-keeper who nearly ruined you 12 years ago, would you know his walk? Would you know the smile of a girl from ten years ago? - I didn't think of that. - You're fools. You're examining her as if she was the real Anastasia. She was shot to death ten years ago by a firing squad. We're not looking for her. - We're seeking only a reasonable facsimile. - But that is unreasonable. - Let's be constructive. - What will the committee say? - Most of them have seen the original. - How? At a ball from a balcony? In church, by candlelight. You saw her. Many did. From a distance or in the newspapers. - Some of the servants are here, in exile. - They saw her through devoted tears. - All right, and the family... - If it was immediate family, I would not try. But they are dead. Do you have faith in the memories of cousins? I don't. - You have faith in nothing. - They'll secretly peer at yellow photographs - which that woman will resemble. - That? Yes, that. Rouge will turn the mouth up a bit. Some powder. A new coiffure. Dresses from the other period. Walk, manner, voice, taught along with faces, names, places. It would be easier if we could present her to the committee in her coffin. Yes. No questions, no answers, no mistakes. - No money either. - I know. Now I know. - Know what? - A cellar. You brought me here to shoot me. - Are you mad? - It's a cellar! - Sit down. - No. Sit down, I said! Pretty good. Pretty good. - A little more rehearsal. - What? He told her the real one was shot in a cellar and... Don't be stupid. I told her nothing. The woman can undoubtedly read. Enough has been written describing their death. - Some say she did not die. - Huh? Where did you get that? He just said so - from a book, or a story I was told. - A rumour, a whisper. - Or it happened. It did not. And that woman is too... too something. Too crazy, too clever, too tricky. I don't care what she is. The important thing is that she fits. Get up. Go over there. - What is it? - Just a drawing. Stand closer. Turn around. - The correct height. - The correct height! Yes. The crown might belong on her head. A drawing of whom? Who is it? A princess. A Russian grand duchess who died in 1918. Princess! Petrovin, a glass of water. - It's all right. - It's all right. - Her Highness is better. - Don't call me that. How well you hear. And how well you know how to use what you hear, and when. - You told a nun that you were Anastasia. - Sick people get sick ideas. Then you were in that asylum in St-Cloud. And before that in Berlin. - Let me out of here! - You were. \x22You were.\x22 \x22You weren't.\x22 \x22Why?\x22 Such questions can only be answered by lies! - Let me go! - Stop it. Stop it! No. No. Please. Please, don't. Don't! - Look at her hand. - What? - Go on, look. - Well? He wants us to look, all right. Come. Now, come under the light. Sit down. Open your hands. I told you there were surprising features. On each palm, a scar. - As from bullets. - Now, look at her head. Above the left temple. A narrow depression extending almost to the forehead. - Just as we were told. - Where did you get those scars? A gift from an unknown admirer. - Where? - I don't remember. Wounds like that, and you don't remember? - Who are you? - No one. - Who are your parents? - None. - Where are you from? - The river. - Before that. - A madhouse. - And before that? - Another river and another madhouse. Oh, come on, now. Who are you? - You tell me. - You must be someone. Why? - Nobody, nothing, no one. - Incredible. But most convenient for us. All right, gentlemen, come over here. Add up the facts. One, she has a resemblance, which we can heighten. Two, she's smart enough to learn. Lack of memory can be attributed to the head wound. Three, she has no identity whatsoever, so it will be difficult for anyone to prove she's someone else. Four... - We have eight days. - Precisely. All in favour of the candidate... - Two to one, elected. - Two to one, elected! Do you realise there are ?10,000,000 at stake?! - 10,000,000? - Yes, my dear. The inheritance of ?10,000,000, left by the Tsar in the Bank of England. - And you want to risk it all on a madwoman. - I must still be in the asylum with the one who sat crouched on the floor because she wasn't born yet. It's you who are mad! I'll have no part of this! Now, now, my dear. The carriage of the head not quite so high. - Grand duchesses are proud but modest. - They are to be killed, not sold. There you are! Mad as a hatter! Now she really thinks she is Anastasia. - I do not! I am not! - But you can be. - She's dead. - That doesn't matter. No one will believe it. The family will call the lie! - Whatever they think, they will accept you. - For ?10,000,000. They'd pretend for money? Is that what they are like? - Isn't everyone? - No. I'm going. - Where? To the river or the madhouse? - The police will pick you up. - If you don't die of starvation sooner. - Come, come. Why did you tell those stories in the hospital? To the little nun? Her eyes grew big as a child's. But then, in the evening, she brought me special things to eat - an orange or some grapes. - We can bring you more. - In another hospital I told other stories, and they believed them too. Especially the one where the train blew up. We were too close to where the mine was planted, so when the train hit it, pieces of metal fell like a shower of fireworks all about us. The man beside me was killed, and the man beside him too. - But I was only wounded. - Oh. So that's how you got those scars. - Yes, so it would seem. - I thought you couldn't remember. I can't always. Things come and go... like waves of mist. But to be her is what you want, what we want, even what the royal family wants! So I've heard before. All of it. \x22Say this.\x22 \x22Remember that.\x22 \x22You are.\x22 \x22You are not.\x22 - Oh, I've heard it many times. - Where? - Bucharest, Berlin... - Berlin? China! I don't remember! But the enthusiasm and the promise, it's those I remember. And then my memory failed. Disappointment. Anger. Dismissal. Out in the street! Failure! Fake! Nobody! There you're wrong. There will not be failure with me. Now, listen. You want to know who you are, don't you? Yes. You want to find the family to whom you belong, don't you? - Yes. Yes. - By yourself, you're lost. - With me, you will find yourself. - Please, I'm tired. You know I am right. The album. Take the chance, it's the only one you have. - I'm too tired to argue. - You don't have to do anything. I'll do it all. Now, here. Look. - It's you on the deck of your father's yacht. - The Standard. - Standard? - You know the name? - It's written on the lifeboat. - Oh, yes. Here you are with your family. Your father the Tsar, your mother, your sisters, your little brother. - My family. - And here. Look. 1913, the anniversary of the house of Romanov - 300 years. There they are, on the balcony of the Winter Palace. That little girl there, that is you. - Thousands kneeling. - Singing \x22God Save the Tsar\x22. - The people. Your people. - Yes. Yes. - You can see it, can't you? - Yes, I can. And now, may I present your staff - Boris Andreivich Chernov, formerly of St Petersburg, banker. Piotr Ivanovich Petrovin, former student of the theological seminary. Sergei Pavlovich Bounine, general of the Tcherkess Regiment, former aide-de-camp attached to the person of His Imperial Majesty Nicholas II, Tsar of all Russia. And I am... I am Her Imperial Highness... the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaievna. Now, once more. Awakened in the middle of the night - and taken to the cellar. - Then, without warning... Guards appeared in the doorway and began firing. One fainted, shielded by the body of her sister. - Which sister? - Was it Olga? - Right. - Yes. Her white dress, then darkness. One of the executioners crashed down with his rifle. Later, two brothers were among the guards that came into the cellar to remove the dead. - One of the bodies moved. - Hers. Hidden in a farm cart under straw, wrapped in sheets filled with snow for her fever, they fled across the country. Bribed guards with jewels sewn into her blouse. - Skirt. - Was it? And they made their way to...? - I don't know. - Balta. - Balta. - And across the Romanian border to...? Bucharest. And there? There... There she died of heartbreak, and was thrown into the sea, to the strains of an old Russian waltz. It was all quite good up to the end. This icon - you're supposed to have seen it before. Remember? Where was it? In my mother's bedroom. She was religious and placed holy pictures everywhere. - Right. - And books and albums. Just like these, scattered about, overflowing the tables. There was a sitting room between the bedroom of my mother and my fa... No, that was that reading room in the hospital. How silly! - More coffee? She won't sleep. - She hasn't time. I don't very much anyway. But thank you. All right. Where were we? Oh, yes. Your mother. I know what I'm talking about. We have three days left. - Let us worry about one thing at a time. - One thing at a time! - All right, I'll take over. - I think she's very tired. I've had my coffee. Besides, it all helps to bring my memory back. And maybe one memory will convince someone. Even if it's only me. - Where did you live in winter? - The Winter Palace, St Petersburg. - Right. Spring? - Spring? I don't remember. - Tsarskoe Selo. - Tsarskoe Selo. Summer? Peterhof - Livadia, preferred for the sea air. - Hunting seat? - Spala. - Where? - In Poland. - Petrovin... - And on the Baltic? No luck, General. The commi... - In Moscow, you stayed...? - At the Kremlin. Sergei Pavlovich, no. The committee will not give us even one more day. - You think she's ready? - No. She thinks she is. Now, listen, she thinks she's Anastasia. And the great Stanislavsky once said \x22When an actor believes he is the character, fire him.\x22 - It's a bit late. - It's a bit late for anything. The eight days are finished. The play is finished. We are finished. The play is replaced by a pantomime. Our leading lady will be weak, exhausted, too sick to talk. With careful staging the committee will be satisfied. And careful casting. Her Imperial Highness will be too weak to see any more than, - let us say, six members. - Why six? Three stupid enough to accept you as Anastasia, three important enough to spread the news that she is Anastasia. Your Highness, may I present a few members of our colony, who are anxious to see you forjust a moment. His Excellency Count llia Feodorovich Bechmetieff and his brother Count Andrei Feodorovich Bechmetieff. His Excellency Court Assessor Schischkin. - Schischkin. - Huh? Your Imperial Highness. His Excellency Von Drivnitz. It's very rude to stare. Forgive me. - Difficult to say. - Madame de Lissenskaia. Come closer. No. You, please. I think I know you. Were you not a lady-in-waiting to my mother? Many people know that, I'm afraid. I'm trying to remember more. When I was a child, I watched the faces of the ladies-in-waiting to see if they were wearing lip rouge. My mother did not allow make-up, so I - I was not mean, just mischievous - I used to report to her. What was it my mother used to call you? Shura? Zina... I'm sorry. It escaped my... Nini. - Yes. Nini. - Your Highness. Your Imperial Highness. - What's wrong? Don't you like my borsch? - No. Too bad. The General says you have to eat it. She won't eat! All right. Go. This entire household has been turned upside down just for you, to help you get well. - I don't like borsch. - I don't care if you like it. Eat it! I warned you not to say one word. You could have ruined everything. - I told you about Nini, didn't I? - Maybe. I don't know. I did, or Petrovin did, but the important thing... Are you angry because you're wondering who I am, or because you want me to do what you tell me? I know who you aren't. Unless you do as I tell you, I'll have a new cigarette girl at my club. We now have a breathing spell we need. You have much to learn if you are to achieve what we agreed. Do you understand? - I understand, Excellency. - Then finish your dinner and get to bed. Work begins again in the morning. - And now, royal etiquette. - All right. One. One, two, three, four. - A queen. - Your Majesty. - A prince of royal blood. - Your Highness. - A prince of ordinary station. - Prince, I suppose, or Your Excellency. - Cabinet ministers... - It's absurd! Even Anna Koreff would know! - Pick up the book. - But why?! Pick up the book. Put it on your head and walk over there. You don't realise that the grace of a true daughter of a tsar... Can not be taught. Either she learns as a child how to hold herself, or it's too late, Excellency. - Did she like to play as a child? - No, but your mother wanted you to. I still don't like it. My hands don't have the strength any more. All right, we can use that as an explanation. But listen to this. Now, this is important. Your tutor wanted you to learn this to prove to your mother... that the lessons were not in vain. - Did I ever learn it? - Yes, but you hated it. I like it now. It's quite pretty. Now around. That's it. Once more. - Now the polonaise. - Can't I rest? - Yes, after dinner. Here we go. - I can't. You will. Head up, back straight. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. - Please. - Please concentrate. - And one, two, three. One, two, three. - My feet hurt. I can't any more. - A little rest, perhaps... - There is no time. The waltz. I'm sure you won't mind doing this. This is the waltz you like so much. The back. With ease, style. - You said it reminded you of something. - Yes, of my first ball. - And your first love, no doubt. - Yes. - Who was he? - I can't remember. Was he fair or was he dark with a moustache? I don't know. One day he's fair, the next he's dark. I don't know. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. - What are you doing here? - Oh, I can't any more! I don't know who I am any more! I don't know what I remember or what I've been told I remember! What is real?! Am I? - Anna. - Anna. Am I Anna? Why not Tamara? Why not Liza? Why not Taziana?! Why not Taziana? Oh, I can't any more. I don't want this. I want to be me, whoever I am. - I want someone to accept me... - Look, you have been working very hard. - But we're almost finished. - Are you? Then you know who I am. - A good night's sleep... - You must know! - Go to bed. - No, I'm leaving! I'm leaving! Stop it! Go to bed at once. My father was very strict. I did not like to obey, but he was ringmaster in a circus. General Bounine? Yes? Who am I? I don't know. My dear madame. Her Highness and the General will be here shortly. May I thank you again for what you are doing. I should not be thanked. It makes me happy to do anything to restore what is rightfully... Oh, Excellency. I cannot tell you how important your presence is here today. My dear Irene, I promised your late father I'd keep an eye on you, - and it's a little trying. - I promise you will not regret coming. That's a promise you may have some difficulty in keeping. - May I sit down? - Oh, do, please. This abominable gout. This way. Albert, a chair for His Excellency. Take care of His Excellency. You know how he is. - The old fox. - I never thought he would come. Well, we may wish he hadn't. How many are you taking? - People will think you're hungry. - Hungry? I'm not hungry, I'm nervous. - Xenia! - Grischa! I must say, a truly wonderful occasion. - Yes. - What? - Red caviar. - You mean... - if the caviar were real... - She would be real. Vassili Dimitrovich, please. Remain here, Your Excellency. Remain here! We will see that they come to you! - I understand. So many dear old faces... - Yes, and it is their dear old names we want... We want signed statements to convince the Bank of England... - Yes! - Yes. The Grand Duchess Anastasia. This way, Your Highness. Fran?ois, the alcove. My dear General, this is all so exciting. Your Imperial Highness, please. Well, Petrovin, here we go. Ladies and gentlemen... dear friends. - I would like to say a few words... - She's doing too much. ..difficult for me to speak today. General Bounine, would you, please? I am the last one to believe in miracles or resurrections, but reality cannot be established without legal help. Witnessed and signed statements. It is our hope, our need, that those among you who believe will come forward after the reception and sign these testimonials voluntarily. Now... I am quite sure that some of you have come here to obstruct. The reasons? Political, monetary - we all know. There are some who have been made understandably cynical by the Revolution, and there are some who will testify to anyone and anything, and have. To none of you do we bring any pressure. To all of you we bring someone who has suffered worse than death for ten lost years. It is our duty to restore this person to the world of the living. If you are sentimental, say it is because she has suffered enough. If you are humane, say justice must be done. If you are Russian, a loyal subject of His late Majesty, then say with me Our only hope is his daughter, Her Imperial Highness Anastasia Nikolaievna. Her Excellency, Countess Baranova. Your Highness. When Irene... when Mme de Lissenskaia told me, I confess I really had doubts. You can understand. It really is a miracle. - Is it? - Yes, Your Highness. We met only once... - Near the tennis courts at Livadia. - Yes. I also remember that my Uncle Alex got you the title because he liked dancing. Then you made a fool of him. My mother and father never liked you, and I never liked you. Please go. Just a moment. You're not Anastasia yet. And if I have any... I said please go. You are mad. Don't answer. But I warn you for the last time. - You're going without seeing Her Highness? - I have seen her. But she will be so disappointed at not having seen you again. - And how do you know that? - You mean how do I...? - Truthfully, we don't. But we're sure she will. - We are sure. Dear Ivan Wassielevich, you've stayed this long, and you did promise... Don't wheedle, Irene. Oh, all right. But don't try to keep me there too long. My foot hurts. Excellency. I think you are due for a surprise. - His Excellency... - I am so glad to see you, Ivan Wassielevich. - They told you my name. How kind. - Won't you sit down? No, thank you. I don't expect to stay. My father's chamberlain was a man of courtesy. His Majesty complimented me on many things. I don't recall his mentioning courtesy. He was also a temperate man who did notjudge before... Forgive me. I have a miserable attack of gout, no doubt punishment for being intemperate, and I'm eager to return to my tub of hot water. There are many characteristics you could recall, many details, but so could dozens of others. My relations with His Majesty's children were impersonal, so my judgement can only be a matter of opinion, and that opinion can only be determined by resemblance and manner. - Your Excellency, ten years is a long time. - No, I've already noted the resemblance. As to the manner, I've been watching, and you've given me pleasure. You've taken me back to my seat in the Imperial Theatre in St Petersburg, second row on the aisle every Tuesday night. For the purpose of acting is not only to imitate reality, but to create illusion. I'm not being sarcastic when I say that you are an excellent actress. Extremely well-trained. My compliments. - I do not accept them. - Madame, my foot is troubling me. My life is troubling me, and it has yet to be lived. You do not believe because you do not wish to. My words will not convince because you're afraid I know the right words. You misquote, madame. I also said that the manner, the deportment of a grand duchess would convince me, but... I don't see it in you. Not a gesture, though one would be worth more than all the words you undoubtedly can produce. Good day, madame. How dare you smoke in my presence without my permission? Who are you? 15... 16... 17... 18... out of a possible 51. You said it would be almost a clean sweep! Didn't the old fox say her performance was art? We're not doing this for art, but for money. This can go on for ever, some saying she is, some saying she isn't. - Precisely. My mind is made up. - Oh? To what? - There's only one way: to go to the top. - You mean the old icon? - Yes, the Dowager Empress. - Oh, sure. The old ramrod sits in her castle in Copenhagen biting her nails because she is waiting for Sarah Bernhardt to give her performance. As head of the family, no one would dare dispute her word. - Dispute her word! - Her Highness would like to see you. - Her what? - Isn't she? - She can wait. - Not too long. She's packing up. Packing up? - Where's Her Highness going? - I don't know. - I thought you enjoyed yourself today. - I became ashamed. Ashamed of being put on display. Ashamed of conjuring up tricks like a circus freak, of asking people to sign papers that I am real! I am real, and I will not stoop to prove it to them. Who are they? - Who are you? - I think I know. Today. And tomorrow? Will you be so sure tomorrow and the day after? Why? Why can't you let me believe? I will help you believe when I am sure. No one will ever be sure, you least of all. I know that. These people today were not worth your efforts, but someone is. One word from her and they will grovel. The Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna. - Grandmama. - Grandmama. - She won't see me. - She will. - How do you know? - I know. - Words! - Schemer, plotter, call me what you will. But you know that if anyone can get you to see that old woman, it is I. And I'll get you there for your sake. - For my sake? - Yes. You never did anything for the sake of anybody but yourself. You enjoy playing with people, making fools of them. You're doing it as ajoke. To prove you are great and alive and the others are small and dead. For money. Go on. It won't hurt. Sit down. If you want to leave after I am through, I won't force you to stay. Let us say you are right. As a matter of fact, you are. But that's all the more reason for you to go to the Empress in Copenhagen. Never trust anyone with noble motives. The good are never sure. In the end they'll let you down. Our motives are different, agreed, but our goal is the same, and that's the only thing that counts. Well? Do we go to Copenhagen? I had a dream the other night. Yes. About your father being a ringmaster. No. This time he was a doll maker, my mother, his assistant who painted the faces. The correct ancestry for a puppet. You know I'll go. You always know. She always wore black, the Empress? Yes. - For ten years I have wanted to see her. - She was never easy, even before the end. Yes, I know. You know or you remember? Prince Paul. Let's see. Nephew to the Empress, second cousin to me, engaged to me when I was... How old? 16. - Quite attractive. - Do you remember him? - No. - Well, you should. I'll tell you a secret. That first waltz you always remember - it was with him. - Danish customs. Anything to declare? - No. Madame? Thank you. Madame Anderson? Madame Anderson? - Oh, yes. - Oh, yes. Bounine. Everything in order? Yes, it seems to be. Welcome to Denmark. Enjoy your visit. Thank you. - I'm sorry, I forgot. I've had so many names. - It was a struggle to get you that one. Why Anderson? You needed some name, and once I was in a situation with... With a lady? As an alias it is innocuous enough. \x22Madame A Anderson.\x22 The least real thing about me is my legal reality. - What happened to Mme Anderson? - Nothing important. You just got tired of her? This visa is good for only 14 days. Two weeks. Most people have a lifetime in which to be accepted. - Suppose two weeks are not enough? - They must be. What's that for? In the cavalry we did it when we saw the infantry marching. Driver, what is this parade? Nothing special. We have it every day the King is here. Thank you. The King? Uncle Chris, cousin to Grandmama, the Empress. Good. Very good. Excuse me, sir. - Will you see Mrs Anderson to her rooms? - Yes. Excuse me, please. Where is the bar? That way, sir. - Well? Not good. - Uh-uh. The Empress absolutely refuses to see you, let alone her. And him? Our Prince Paul lives on the old lady's allowance. - He was always rather courageous. - One possibility. Remember Baroness von Livenbaum, the crazy lady-in-waiting to the Empress? - Vaguely. - She remembers you clearly. Just a moment. You have a rendezvous with her tomorrow at four. - Rendezvous? - Yes, at the Tivoli Gardens. It isn't! It can't be! It is! - Elena von Livenbaum. - Sergei Bounine. - Do sit down. - Thank you. No, it's too dangerous. But I will. Dangerous? Come. Whom could we run into here except children? That's exactly why I chose it. How fit you look. Superb! But this is a stiflingly small town. A village. Chattering tongues will gossip to Her Majesty. \x22Your lady-in-waiting was seen with that man. That man!\x22 A flagon of your delicious beer. I always drink what the natives drink. - This is madness without the moon! - My dear Baroness, you will never change. You're trying to bribe me, as the Empress said you would. Where is she? - The Empress? - She's playing solitaire with her memories. No, dear General. Anastasia. Or should I say Her Highness? Is it really she? I long to meet her. So you shall, as soon as she is properly introduced to Copenhagen. What a look you have. - How inevitable that I am useless to you. - Why? The Empress will never receive you or that woman. You know her - an unmeltable icicle. Thank you. You won't get at her through Paul. He sends her bills as if they were invitations. He behaves as if we were still in Russia. Russia! I'm all Chekhov's Three Sisters rolled into one. I'll never get back there. You must have a pleasant life with the Empress. With Her Majesty, life is one eternal glass of milk. - There must be some court life. - Not a crumb. - She never entertains? - Her phantoms. Ghosts of her dead family. But she must go out for a drive, or shopping, or a museum? If you ever speak, whisper, breathe one word... She does go out occasionally if there's anything Russian. Opera or ballet. Let me see. They're performing a ballet of Tchaikovsky's this week at the Royal Theatre. Thursday, I believe. Come over here for a moment. I want you to look as beautiful as possible tonight. - Oh. - He's quite a simple soul, really, Prince Paul. His vocation and avocation are the pursuit of beautiful women. If you thought it necessary, I suppose you'd even have sent me to a plastic surgeon. - Take your seat. - It's so long since I've been to a theatre. Don't display too much excitement. Sit down. - General, they just arrived. - She too? Yes. - Programme. - Your Majesty. - The box nearest the stage. - The man you want me to look beautiful for? - Yes. - My fianc?? The lady next to him is Baroness von Livenbaum, lady-in-waiting to the Empress. - Where is the Empress? - At the back of the box, behind the curtain. So close after so many years. I'm suddenly frightened. Go with them to the buffet and stand facing this way. - Tonight can mean... - I know what tonight can mean. Go ahead. Uh, please, three coffees. - Have you seen her before? - No. - Good evening, Your Highness. - We were talking about you. When did you return? - Where from? - The hunting trip I was told you were on. Oh. My relations with my aunt force me to be on far too many trips. I apologise. - I understand. - Who's the lovely lady? - Mrs Anderson? - Lovely. - Yes, she is rather pretty. - Is she Danish? English? Well, she's many things. Would you like to meet her? You know very well I would. May I present His Highness Prince Paul von Haraldburg? Her Imperial Highness, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaievna. I should have known. - Travelling under the name of Mrs Anderson. - Surprised? - I wasn't sure I recognised you either. - But you are sure now? Yes. I shall not ask yet whether you are. You're either very kind or very tactful. My compliments. - Will you both excuse me? - You are afraid. As a little boy, you always were. Is it such a terrible risk to have a drink with us? Anything with the general is a risk, even a drink. - Then have it with me. - Now it is my turn. - Will you both excuse me? - Of course. You have changed. - So have you. - Then you do remember? I remember a girl who used to back me into a corner. I remember a boy who took time to make up his mind. - For example? - Ah. You are testing me? No, prodding you to talk so I can enjoy looking at you. Champagne? Why not? Uh, the Baroness von Livenbaum, please. General Bounine! Quelle surprise! Vassili, Her Majesty would like a glass of mineral water. You are a monster. I've survived a revolution. I suppose I can survive this. Will you forgive me if I make sure he gets the right water? - Her Majesty is madly particular. - Certainly. - Your Majesty. - Who is it? - Oh. - Your Majesty, forgive me. - I did once, when I heard you'd been shot. - I was sentenced twice. - By whom? The whites or the reds? - Both. Good for them, but you are still here. - I have asked Your Majesty's pardon. - For what? For this intrusion? For using the name of Romanov to launch a commercial enterprise? - For hammering at my gate for days? - Your Majesty... Bounine, I have already been shown two Tatianas, an Alexei and a Maria, as well as an Anastasia. I will not see your client. I am as weary of these spectral grandchildren as I am of false hope. I have lost everything I have loved - husband, family, position, country. I have nothing but memories. I want to be left alone with them. - Perhaps one memory may be a reality. - The only reality for you is an investment. Only a fool would bring you a mere investment. Whatever you may think of me you must know I am no fool. I too have gone through the Revolution. The effects of yourjourney are not visible. You know she is not my granddaughter. Quite honestly, I don't know who she is. But there is so much that cannot be explained unless she is the woman she believes she is. - I see it mattered more to you than I thought. - I beg your pardon? You really wanted that title. You're not doing this for money. You never forgave my family, did you? I am here to tell you that whoever this woman is, she asks only one thing - to see you. There are not enough years left for me to see every madwoman with a royal obsession. If she must see me, show her my photographs. - Your Majesty... - Go back to Paris. You are wasting your time. General, good evening. - Your Majesty, I thought perhaps that you... - Save your nonsense. My cape. So, Bounine is still attractive. - Yes, Your Majesty. - Madly attractive. - Yes, Your Majesty. - Your voluptuous fancies are disgusting. To a woman of your age sex should mean only gender. Yes, Your Majesty. - You saw her? What did she say? Did she... - I did not see her. What did he say? He was charming. I like him more than I thought I would from your description. - Do you? - Don't you want me to? I want you to make him like you more than he thought he would. - Forgive me. I just ran into somebody. - I forgive you. You ran into a blonde. Very pretty. Is she married? And who is she? - I don't know yet. - You can tell me. Livenbaum, I came for the other performance. Your Majesty. - The jewels, please. - Jewels? Yes, the jewels. Will you put these in the safe downstairs? - Why? They are fake. - You know that but the manager won't. Ah. - Public relations. - Anything else? - No. See you in the morning. Good night. - Good night. You did very well tonight. Thank you. Am I dismissed now too? Yes, you had better rest. Prince Paul will call for you tomorrow evening. - Thank you for achieving the invitation. - You achieved it. I merely accepted. The Empress doesn't want to see me, does she? - She will see you. - I'm sure she said no tonight. So now the route is through Paul, via me. You don't hesitate to use anybody, do you? Oh, I hesitate. I hesitate until I am sure of the desires of those concerned. Good night. To begin with, a nice, clear champagne soup and then, I think, a fricassee of champagne. - No vegetables. - But a champagne salad. - Excellent. - Dessert? A small champagne souffl?. 1921 is a very good year for souffl?. I don't like champagne. I only like what it does to me. - You won't like it in the morning. - I'll adore it. I'll have a fantastically enormous hangover and your friend Bounine will be furious. Do you know what he is? Vodka. Quick, hard, sharp. And you? - Champagne, I hope. - Don't be greedy. - As a little girl you used to say... - Oh, no, no, not tonight. How many times have we been together? Four? Five? - Three. - And every time... Every time I've heard your mind - \x22Click, click, click. Is she? Isn't she?\x22 It's very, very unattractive of you, and very noisy. Tonight I just want to have a good time. Do you know who I am? No. A woman. - An extremely attractive one. - Then behave accordingly. Well, that's... that's difficult. No \x22click, click, click\x22. Not a one. 1921, definitely. Excuse me. I apologise for the intrusion but Her Highness has not yet recovered. Her doctor has given orders that she retire early. Vodka! Pure vodka! Oh, poor Cinderella! The coach turned into a pumpkin and the footman into a big white rat. - Your Highness... - You think the glass slipper cut her? - Good night. - Oh, that ugly stepsister. Good night. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you. Thank you. Pleasant dreams. Good evening. Ah! Uh, I... I forgot. My compliments to the chef! - Good night. - May I speak to you? - It's very late. - It's very important. All right, I enjoy her company, and I agree she's beautiful. With the possibility of inheriting ?10,000,000. Bounine, everyone is aware of my weakness - and yours - for beauty and money. I don't think it's inhuman. They're the most desirable items. All right. What do you propose to do? At times, you push too hard. Her visa expires in four days. If she hasn't seen the Empress... You've been knocking too loudly on the door. When my aunt thinks somebody's trying to force her to do something, she does nothing. - When do you do something? - It depends. On the odds? You're pushing again. They are high this time, my dear prince. Very high. Good night. One, two. Three, four. - General? General, I'm hungry. - You just came from a restaurant, didn't you? Oh, such a funny restaurant. No food! Why don't you take me there tomorrow? - You've had too much to drink. - No, not quite enough. - Shall I call for some more? - No. No! It must be very dreary in your room. Everyone in mine is having a wonderful time. - Would you care to join us? - Please stop the nonsense and go to sleep. Go to sleep Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep General, I have a confession to make. I was lying. There's no one here but me. Can you hear me? General, why don't you make a concession? Uh... I mean, confession. Well, it's the same thing. Come on, General. One little confession. One sweet, tiny confession. Prince Paul was asking for you twice. Thank you, Fedya. Good afternoon, Your Majesty. Enjoy the drive? - Yes, it was quiet. - Prince Paul... - I heard. He called twice. - He's still waiting, Your Majesty. - Sorry to be so persistent but it is, uh... - Money? - Much more important. - Oh. A woman. Very well. Come in. Well, who is she? - I'll come straight to the point. - You usually do. - Is Her Majesty back? - Yes. - Late, dear Countess, late. - Livenbaum, I'm in no mood for you. I had to go all the way to town on the trolley, my dear, while you... - Your bursitis again. - I do not have bursitis. I have migraine. In the shoulder? Another area wouldn't surprise me. Livenbaum, enough is... - Is someone in there with her? - Paul. Paul! You know he's been seen publicly with that woman. - Which woman? - The impostor! Prenez garde. Perhaps the Empress will accept her. - He's going to talk her into it? - She's getting old. - Never. - And lonely. - Never. - And she... - Never. - Livenbaum. Your Majesty? Do you know what he wanted? - I can imagine, Your Majesty. - To receive that woman. How easily he swallows the tricks she performs. And what do they prove? That she can memorise the teachings of Bounine. What if there is a resemblance? What if she does think she is Anastasia? Wanting a dream does not make it true. She's a fraud. She must be. Well, isn't she? I... don't know, Your Majesty. You all think I'm stubborn, don't you? I am. Very stubborn. Perhaps too stubborn. At what hotel is she staying? \x22Believe me, I really tried. My sincere regrets.\x22 Sincere! \x22Signed, Paul.\x22 - Miserable handwriting. - You think he saw the Empress? Huh! What's the difference if he did and she refused or if he didn't? The answer is the same for us - no. Hello? Yes. And who? Thank you. Baroness von Livenbaum is on her way up with a lady. - What lady? - I think you'd better go inside, both of you. Lady! Do you think it is... - Yes, I do. - Petrovin, come. - Who is on the way up? - I think the Empress. She's coming here? Now? I don't think I can face her. - Don't be a fool. - No, I'm not well. Must it be now? If I only had some time. Get ready. - Your Majesty. - Wait downstairs, Livenbaum. I am grateful. I hope you will not allow your opinion of me to interfere... Bring her in. Your Highness, Her Majesty is waiting. Courage. Yes. The resemblance is quite good enough for a waxworks gallery. - Don't you recognise me? - Should I? Who are you? - Where were you born? - My birth certificate says Tsarskoe Selo, but I was really born in Peterhof. Daughter, no doubt, to Tsar Nicholas II and Alexandra. And granddaughter to Maria Feodorovna, Dowager Empress. I have received too many appeals from resurrected Romanovs. The firing squads were such poor shots it's amazing the Revolution succeeded. Twice I started out to find you but there were so many days, weeks, even months - when I didn't know who I was. - And now you do? I thought I did, but if you don't know me... Have I changed so much, Your Majesty? One does not change, mademoiselle. No. Not if one is loved. Perhaps if love had not been cut off so abruptly, I would not have changed so. You are making vulgar and sentimental use of an episode which is for me a great sorrow. Forgive me. I forgot for a moment that you'd regard that tragedy as more yours than mine. I am trying to... You're making it very difficult for me, Grandmama. I did not give you permission to call me that. I'm sorry. You'd think a lonely old woman should be eager to be called Grandmama. - My loneliness has been as sharp as yours. - We are most of us lonely, and it is mostly of our own making, but no masquerade can fill the emptiness. You ask me for recognition. You do it well. Your eyes are moist. Your voice blurred with feeling. I believe you are lonely and you want love. Who does not? But the love you beg from me belongs to one who is dead. Are you so sure? You won the endorsement of the sentimental, the greedy. I am none of those. So you shut me out before you even open that door. I was told you'd ask hard questions. You're not interested enough for one. I'm not interested in a show of tricks taught by your business associates. I care nothing about their business or the money. - Ah, but you know of the inheritance. - I know what they told me. I don't want money. Tell me to whom it should be given. I'll give it. But you cannot give it away until you have it, and you cannot get it without my recognition. It's useless to say that that is not what I want. You are so hard. I remember Father saying that you were harder than anyone in the family. I thought at the time that it was a strong word to use just because you and my mother were quarrelling over a necklace. Some emeralds. You wanted to keep them though they were imperial treasure. Who told you that? Oh, many could have known. You wore them with your last court dress. Green and gold velvet and a long train. The photograph was unflattering but accurate. My father took my mother's side in the quarrel. There they were, all against you, but you were stubborn. You kept Figgy's emeralds. How did you learn to call Catherine the Great Figgy? We always called her that. We gave the name to Maria because she had an eye for the men. - And Olga used to say... - Stop! - I forbid you to bandy those names! - I can speak of them if I choose. - They are my sisters. - Impostor! You call me that. If you have any decency, end this charade at once. - I will pay you, more than Bounine promised. - Go away! - I'm offering you money. - Go. So, you are giving up. It wasn't enough to suffer the asylum, people trying me, using me, rejecting me, - and before that the cellar and the flight. - Rescue from the edge of the grave, years of lost memory in an asylum? Excellent material for melodrama. Long, empty days when the consciousness of living came only through pain. Hardly melodrama. And then slowly, finally, struggling up, out of the water, into the light, into the air, thinking \x22Yes, perhaps. Yes.\x22 \x22I may be. I must be.\x22 \x22I am. I am, and my grandmother is still alive to tell me so.\x22 \x22My grandmother is alive to hold out her hand full of money.\x22 I'd rather you slapped me with that hand. The tragic scene of despair. Well done. You're forgetting nothing, are you? I am sorry that your failure to win me over is such a cruel disappointment. Goodbye. - Oh, don't go! - But you just told me to. I'll say nothing more to try and convince you. - Then what do you want of me? - A moment or two longer to be with you, to pretend you do not think what you do, to close my eyes and pretend it is years ago. A terrace in the summer sun... No, no, no. I promise. I promise I will not say names or places. The smell of the sea air. The sound of a tennis ball. The laughter from the courts beyond the trees. And your voice calling me \x22Malenkaia\x22. Then the sudden lightning in the summer sky. Are you ill? I was but I'm not now. Have you seen a doctor? A good one? I'm well-acquainted with doctors. It is kind of you to ask. - I'd better go. - I'm not surprised you do not recognise me. - I have changed very much. - You asked for one moment. What is strange is that you have changed so little. It is as though the horror of all these last years has only made you stronger. I am not strong. Let go. You are too clever for me. I am an old woman. My strength is only outward now. - At least we met again. - And we will again when my mind is clearer. - But now... - No, we'd better not meet again. You have softened towards me but later you'll regret it. You'll say \x22It was all acting. She was some cheap little actress they hired for money.\x22 And in a way, they did hire me. I was starving after I ran from the last asylum. I had nowhere to go. Bounine found me by the Seine. Maybe there's more good to him than we think. Maybe I should have run from him too but I was so tired. Are you all right? Yes, and if it is better for you not to believe, then... - You are ill. - No. I cough only because I'm a little frightened. It doesn't mean... Say that again. That I cough when I'm frightened? When you were a little girl you coughed when you were frightened. Malenkaia! Malenkaia! You have come from so far away and I have waited so long. No, no, no, no. Don't cry. There's no need to be frightened. No, no, don't speak. You are safe, Anastasia. You are with me. You are home. The phantoms can go! The closed rooms can be opened! You know, I have a footman. Oh, he's a very old man. Each night he goes from one room to the other, lighting the empty lamps until the great dark rooms are a blaze of light, and perhaps that is true of all of us. We are lighting dead lamps to illumine a past that is gone. I thought you were gone, but you have come back, Anastasia. You have come back. But, oh, please, if it should not be you, don't ever tell me. ..many beautiful shops and restaurants. Yes. Also, we might make a small trip to America. After all, it's the only country left with a proper respect for wealth. - I hate trips. - I would like to go to Uruguay. Yes? Why? - I like the name. Uruguay. - I hate it. And Guatemala. They sound so far away. Yes, very. Why don't you charter a boat and sail the high sea? I hate the sea. My dear Maxime, you are here to eat, drink, enjoy the show and have fun. I hate Russian food, I hate bad champagne, I'm sick of the gypsies, and I'm having a terrible time. - Then why don't you go home? - I hate my room even more. So soon? Hey, he is back from the station. - Maybe she was not on the train. - Maybe. Anything wrong? Did you meet the train? She was on it? The Empress? Paul? - Well? - Everything is up... Go powder your nose. How long should I take? We'll call you. Go on. Go on. Well, Petrovin... they all arrived. - Then why isn't he at the hotel with her? - Yes. Probably it is Copenhagen all over again. - He should have stayed there. - Stayed? But the Empress would not let him see Her Highness. That's what Paul said. No, it was wasting money to stay. Von Livenbaum is expecting you at 10am. They agreed to the presentation ceremony tomorrow night? We can have the press conference at 7.30. - In the ballroom of their hotel. - Good. - What about the marriage rumours? - Can we announce her engagement to Paul? You know, every time Paul is mentioned he gets peculiar. - You don't think he's getting jealous? - Yes. I began to think back in Copenhagen. - You're eating like a pig again. - I'm nervous again. Where is that from? - The opera warehouse. - Impressive. Stepan, get rid of those lights. What time is it? - 7.40. The press has been waiting for... - Too late to do anything about that throne. Stop that nonsense! Petrovin. - But they are rehearsing. - Later. Please, gentlemen, please. After the press conference. I am confused. Confused! When we originally discussed the present... Stepan, tell Her Highness we're ready. Petrovin, let the press in. - Did you see her or talk to her? - I told you 50 times. I have not seen her, him, nor the Empress. Perhaps if I write it carefully in big letters... Sorry. I'm bored with the whole business. The sooner it's over with, the better. You certainly have changed. But don't get too bored. It is a little too late. You will find copies of the guest list on this table. Yes, this is the very room in which the presentation ceremony will take place later. Ladies and gentlemen, I regret you cannot be here tonight, but such is the wish of Her Majesty the Dowager Empress. But the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaievna has consented to see you. At 9.30 the ball will be opened by the Grand Duchess and His Highness Prince Paul von Haraldburg. - At 10.15... - Is it true they're to be married? - Will the engagement be announced tonight? - Off the record... At this time there is no information on that. Proceed. At 10.15, the Dowager Empress will make her appearance. At 10.20, the Russian national anthem will be played, and Her Majesty will present... Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to present Her Imperial Highness the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaievna. - What a beautiful dress. - Get a picture of her coming down. - What? - Extraordinary taste. Can we get a picture? Her Highness is not fully recovered from her illness, so be as brief as possible with your questions. Is it true it was difficult for you to see the Empress? I was three weeks in Copenhagen. Almost all of it I spent with her. Are you going to marry Prince Paul? - I found the city charming. - What about the inheritance? - How will you spend it? - Will you get 10,000,000? If I receive an inheritance, it will be more of a surprise to me than to you. Did you go to Romania after you escaped from Russia? Yes. Were you in a hospital in Bucharest in December 1920? Yes, I was in a hospital in Bucharest. When, I do not remember precisely. Don't you? I do. I was convalescing in the next ward when they brought you in. - It is possible. - Possible, but you don't remember. Well, when they discharged you a man was waiting for you and took you home. Me. - General, I beg you. We cannot... - Quiet. - What is your name? - Mikhail Vlados. - Vlados. - And yours is Anna Koreff! - Koreff? Is that true? - Yes, I have used that name. - Used it? - She has used many names. She has been forced to hide and suffered amnesia. Please. Mikhail Vlados. Yes, we were in the same hospital in Bucharest. - They treated you for head wounds. - They did. Which you got in a train explosion outside Bucharest. - Is that true? - Are you Anna Koreff? - Please, I would like to answer. - All right. Ladies and gentlemen, please. Please! Her Highness cannot hear you, let alone answer. What is it you wish to know? Whether I was wounded in a train explosion? - Yes. - Were you? I remember being in a train explosion. Whether or not I was wounded, I do not know. - Where did you get the wounds? - Russia or Bucharest? - Is it not possible to be wounded twice? - In a war, maybe. - What else is a revolution? - I'm sorry, the interview is over. Make sure there are men posted at every entrance to keep reporters out, - and check every invitation at the door. - Yes, sir. I don't make things easier for you, do I? Was it a disaster? No matter what the papers print, before they come out the guests will be here and the Empress will have made the presentation. Oh, forgive me. May I? You may even give me one. Thank you. The stairs aren't doing that dress any good. - It doesn't matter. - It will in an hour. I haven't seen you in a long time. And you missed me terribly. I missed you, yes. Whose orders kept you away? The Empress's or Paul's? It never occurred to you that I can function without orders from anyone. Then you didn't want to see me. Why? - I thought it better not to. - Then the marriage rumours are true. - You said Paul and I were engaged once. - Aren't you taking your duties too seriously? Independently, you mean. The puppet has pulled the strings. This is childish. You've always thought people want you to do only what they say. No, not people. You. Nonsense. Is it? You pushed me at Paul, and now you are against him. Why? Are you afraid that he'll be in control? - Over what? - Me. The money. - I don't give a hang about the money. - Are you worried I might be Anna Koreff? I don't care what your name is. I care what you are. - What worries me is how you've changed. - I've changed? When we began you wanted to find out who you were. - You said it was all you wanted. - Yes. - I said... - But is it? No. Now you must be the Grand Duchess, upon a throne before a morgue of royal corpses. - Must you always hate and ridicule? - Ridicule who? Your loving subjects? Those embalmed skeletons? They don't care about you. They don't care who is Anastasia so long as they get some money and a better position. A month ago you wanted it, and you wanted it for me. - Now I like it. - Go on, like it. Be a grand duchess. Make it really royal. Marry a man who wouldn't come within ten feet of the altar if you were not an heiress. Oh, the truth is insulting. You said once that I was selfish and ambitious. I admitted it. Why don't you now have the courage to admit I'm right? - Remember? - What? - The music. This waltz. - Yes, of course. - No. You don't really. - Sorry. Should I? No. It was a long time ago. My first waltz. My first ball. My first... What? Partner. I thought it was you. - It must have been somebody else. - It might have been me. It really doesn't matter. It might not even have been at the ball. - I don't understand you. - Why? - Because I didn't deny what Vlados said? - Yes. - How do you know I am not Anna Koreff? - Be serious. - I am. - You're deliberately behaving very strangely. How do you know how Anna Koreff behaves? I know how you behave, and all I care about is you. - Do you mean that? - Of course. - Let's announce our engagement tonight. - I want to very much. Prince Paul to Anna Koreff. Will you announce that? - Certainly not. - Oh. - Because it's not true. - No? Suppose I have no title, no inheritance, nothing. I can't suppose that when I know who you are. Still, what if I can't get the money? Or if I make no claim to it? You can and you will. Why be poor when you could so easily be very rich? The poor have only one advantage. They know when they are loved for themselves. Sorry, but I refuse to take that remark seriously. - The Empress is ready. - Good. - It's almost time. - All right. - Oh, Petrovin, should I not be back in time... - Why not? Just go ahead without me. - Isn't this all superb? - I have never seen you look so well. In this? They don't know how to make baggage nowadays. Imagine trying to fit this into a nasty little modern suitcase. The times aren't suited for elegance, but you have brought it back ce soir. - What's the matter? You look upset. - Just tired. Would you ask Her Majesty if she'd receive me? You know I will. General! General! - You may go in. - That's kind. Just in case, she's heard about the reporters. - Thank you. - Vassili, Her Majesty's expecting the general. I was going to send for you. My granddaughter tells me - to expect some unpleasantness in the paper. - I'm afraid so. Thank you. The man was probably a hired troublemaker. - Her Highness says that... - I am aware what she says. Unfortunately, she is not aware that truth serves only a world that lives by it. I have prepared a statement for the press that I want you to give to them. - I am leaving now, Your Majesty. - Oh. And why? I feel that my work is finished - satisfactorily, I trust - and since this is your evening, I felt it my duty... No, that isn't quite true. I simply wanted to say goodbye to you. Extraordinary. You want to leave before the spectacle. I thought no one would watch it with more triumph than you. If the evening belongs to anyone, it is to you. We are all grateful. - Thank you, but I want no further part in it. - Come! You performed an enormous task, restoring my granddaughter to her rightful position. And you even effected her reunion with her childhood sweetheart. - Yes. To a degree, I suppose I did. - But you are not pleased with it, are you? - Your Majesty... - You are not pleased. Why not? - But I am in not a position... - Oh, come! After all, it is unlike you to speak of position, Bounine. - When I am with Your Majesty I'm aware of it. - Thank you. Then I request you answer. If it is what Her Highness the Grand Duchess really desires, why, then I must be pleased. But for myself, no, I am not pleased. We should not only have given you a title, we should have made you an ambassador. How deviously you have arrived at what you wanted to say, and even now you don't say it. You have not given me even a piece of string to hang you with. Sergei Pavlovich, what do you wish to ask? Why do you try to ask me? Why have you not asked her? What is difficult for others is simple for me. But what has always been simplest for others is impossible for me. I made the attempt, Your Majesty, but it became translated into anger. You are less of a knave than I thought, but very much more of a fool. Yes? - Excuse me, Your Majesty. It's time. - So soon? Bounine, I want you to wait for me here. This time it is a command. Will you? Yes, Your Majesty. I will. Your Majesty, I cannot wait for you to look down into the ballroom. You'll weep absolute tears. Everyone's there. And the gowns and the uniforms... - It's incredibly like it used to be. - Yes, I can smell the mothballs. Your Imperial Majesty, I beg you... Excuse me. If Your Majesty will permit me to explain the ceremony and... - Livenbaum. - We discussed it this morning. - But... - The \x22but\x22 we'll discuss later. Yes, Baroness. How lovely you are. - Are you having a good time? - Yes. - Where is Paul? - He's dancing. - He dances very well. - Yes, very. - And he's very handsome. - Yes, he's handsome. - Your Majesty, a thousand apologies. - Your Majesty, it is time. If they waited ten years they should not mind waiting ten minutes. Livenbaum, I want to speak to my granddaughter alone. Out, gentlemen. Out! Where is Bounine? It is just like him to disappear when he is needed. All right, ladies. Count. Livenbaum? That gentleman you are so fond of. See that he does not leave the greenroom. Yes, Your Majesty. - They're whirling in delight down there. - Yes. Come here. Let me put it on for you. You got tired of it already? - It's just that I'm not used to one. - It takes time. Are you sure about Paul? Why... I... - I like him very much. - Why do you stammer? I was surprised by the suddenness of the question. If you love, the answer is ready. I was asked to announce your engagement. - Are you sure you want me to? - I want to marry. Why? I suppose I want the belonging, the closeness. - Am I selfish? - No, but do you want this with Paul? I think it would please you, and anything that would please you would please me. - Do you know you're talking like Bounine? - Oh, no. Oh, yes. Anastasia Nikolaievna, you don't really want to marry Paul. - I don't know. - You do know, because you really want someone else. Do I? Maybe. Except that all this time, the only thing I thought I really wanted was you. That you already have, and it's not enough, nor should it be. No one can blame me for living with my dear phantoms, but you, you must find the things from which other women make their happiness. Sit here forjust one moment longer. Livenbaum says things are just as they used to be down in the ballroom. She is foolish. The world moves on, and we must move on with it or be left to moulder with the past. I am the past. I like it. It's sweet and familiar. And the present is cold and foreign. And the future? Fortunately, I don't need to concern myself with that. But you do. It's yours. - Unfasten this for me. - Figgy's emeralds? - Yes. I want to give them to you. - Grandmama. You have given me what no one else in the world could. Myself. Thank you. Here. Here. You'd better fix it yourself. Go into the greenroom. Livenbaum will help you. Yes, Grandmama. Hurry. There's not much time. Forgive me, Your Majesty. Yes? What is it? I thought you'd like to know that the gentleman no longer waits alone. Good. I suppose we shall have to go on with the performance. - Bring in the jesters. - Yes, Your Majesty. Ladies and gentlemen. Baroness. Your Majesty, we cannot keep them waiting any longer. - May we proceed? - Yes, proceed. Majesty. - Oh, uh... the musicians. - All arranged. Good. Take your position by the curtains. - Yes, sir. - Hey! Straighten your tie. Your Excellency, don't forget. All the names loud, strong, clear. - Don't worry. - Thank you, Excellency. Uh... Ladies, get ready. - Where is, uh... where is Prince Paul? - I've told you twice. He's coming. Three times you said you cannot find Bounine. - I also told you that he said... - To go ahead without him. Well, I say there is something unbalanced with him tonight, and the sooner we fin... Oh, Your Highness. Your Majesty. - I've never seen you look like this. - I have never felt like this. It is time. Inform Her Imperial Highness the Grand Duchess that we are ready. - Right away. - Hurry. Baroness, uh... the procedure, to refresh your memory as to what we discussed this morning. You think my mind is failing? Baron... Ladies and gentlemen, there will be a... a drum roll. After that, Her Imperial Majesty the Dowager Empress will come forward, and when she passes through the curtains the orchestra will strike up our national anthem. - After that, the Grand Duchess... - She has gone! - Gone? Where? What is he talking about? - She's not there! - But this is impossible. I mean, she must... - Silence! - You have looked in the greenroom? - Yes. There is no one there. - No one. - Perhaps she went to her room. You won't find her. They have both gone. - Both? - She and your friend Bounine. - Bounine? - But why? I don't understand. - You never did. - You mean the others were right. - She was not Anastasia after all. - Wasn't she? Your Majesty, I beg you. They're all waiting. What shall we say? What can we say? Nothing. Paul, your arm. I will speak to them. Oh, thank you, Your Majesty. Everybody, please. Forgive me, Aunt Marie, but what will you say? Say? Oh, I will say \x22The play is over. Go home.\x22 Visiontext Subtitles: Abigail Smith
