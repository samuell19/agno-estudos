(crickets chirping) Denise, come here. Come here. No, stop! (screaming) No! No, don't! No! No! No! No! (Denise moaning) Please, no! (blade swooshing) ("Beautiful Dreamer" playing) (Denise sighing) (ominous music) (ominous music cont.) (water splashing) (eerie music) (water lapping) Hi. Hi, babe. You and me got some serious problems. We gotta work a few things out. You know what I mean? Well, this isn't a very good time or place, Josh. Fine. I can wait. [Leslie] It seemed like Josh always had a problem. But little did I know that it would lead me into the most terrifying summer of my life. (metal clanking) (tense music) (water splashing) (dramatic rumbling) [Janna] Here's Janna. Janna, I told you before! Okay, okay. (brooding music) Oh, I'm sorry I scared you. Honestly, Les, you really need to lighten up a little. Besides, I just came over to tell you Josh is on campus. He came by the room looking for you. His usual Prince Charming self, I might add. He's already been here. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. Tell him, I guess. I don't know why it is so hard for you. Well, it's hard to explain to someone who doesn't really know him. I've known him all my life, Janna, and he's always gotten everything he's ever wanted. One way or the other. Yeah, well, maybe that's the problem. Look, Les, you know he's had other girls. That doesn't make any difference. Josh and I have been planning to get married since high school. My parents threw such a big fit that we agreed I'd go to a college for a couple of years. So if he really loves you, he'll wait another two years. It's your life, too, you know. I don't think Josh is going to give up his plans easily just because I'm not sure I want them anymore. Who cares? He can't make you marry him, can he? Tell him what he can do with it. (sighs) If you're going with me, come on. I wanna get packed so I can get on down to the lake in the morning. Let's go. Okay, but I'm sure not looking forward to this. (bells tolling) Leslie, I need you to talk to you. I better talk to him. Will you wait for me? All right, sure. (bells tolling) [Leslie] Josh! (both arguing faintly) [Josh] No, listen to me. Don't talk to me that way. (speaking faintly) Come, Les, you're coming with me right now. Stop it, Josh. Shit! [Leslie] Let go, Josh. I don't want to. Come on. Stop it! Leave her alone. Get outta my way. So go ahead, big man. You know, Jan, I've had just about enough of you butting into other people's business and I'm gonna put a stop to it. I'm gonna get even with you. And as for you, well, this isn't over. Not by a long shot. (insects chirping) (rock music playing on radio) You see what I mean?

[DJ] You're listening to KILL in Gore. It's Josh. I better talk to him. You don't have to, you know. I know. (tense music) Hello? No, I can't. I just can't right now.

Look, Les, all I know is there's a time to make your stand and a time to walk away. Until you can look that bastard in the face and tell him once and for all that you're making your own decisions about your own future, well, I think right now, you just better walk away. Look at you. You jump every time someone looks at you. (sighs) We can go to the lake. It's quiet there. You can get yourself together and later on, you can do what you need to do.

But Josh had been so intimidating, and Janna so protective, that I felt as though I was being dragged along. And at the time, we didn't know of the murders that were taking place at the lake.

How Tenkiller was really this beautiful Indian maiden and not a man, like you think. Over there's the Cove. Oh, let's go down and see if Charlie's there. Then we can hurry on to the cabin. I'd love to get a swim in before it gets too dark. (upbeat music) Hi. Hi. [Debbie] You need to see a menu? No, thanks. ls Charlie here? I think so. You need to talk to him? Yes, please. [Debbie] Just a second. Hi, Tor. How you doing there, Debbie? Hey, Charlie. [Charlie] Yeah? Somebody out here needs to talk to you. ♪ Late at night and lying about where you been ♪ Well, look who's here. Hey, Charlie. How you been doing? Oh, I can't complain. I'd be doing better if I'd get you in here and get you to work. Well, help is here, Charlie. How soon could you start? I've been doing all the cooking myself ever since my good waitress took off somewhere without telling me and, uh, that one over there may as well disappear for all the good she's doing. [Janna] Well, I can come in on Monday, but I wanna show Les here the lake this weekend. Actually, it looks like you might be able to use Leslie here, too. Can you cook? Sure, a little. Oh, she can cook hamburgers, Charlie. And you know anyone with half a brain can handle the fishermen around here. Oh, come on. On, baby. Well, let me check with the knothead and see what she has planned. I'll call you over the weekend. Okay. You have the number at the cabin? All right, well, if we're not there, just leave a message on the answering machine. Yeah. Don't you two want something to eat? No, I'm sure we'll get plenty of your cooking before the summer's over with. Bye, Charlie. You better call. Okay, see what I can do. Charlie. Yeah? What'd they want? The smaller one is my summer waitress. She's been working for me every year since she was 14 and that girl could really work. Yeah? Who's the other girl, Charlie? I don't know. A friend of Janna's, I guess. Good looking girls, though, aren't they? Yeah. Hey, Charlie, you haven't heard anything from Denise, have you? [Charlie] Not a word. You? Nothing. This doesn't seem like something she'd do. Did you have a fight? Not a fight. No. Things have kind of cooled off a little bit, though. You just don't wanna admit that she ran off with some cowboy from [indistinct]. Say, Charlie, you think I could have off work just a little early? I got a date. I guess. Thanks, Charlie. Women. Yeah. (birds squawking) (birds chirping) (tense music) [Janna] So what do you think of it? Well, it sure is quiet. Aren't there any neighbors around? Not close. There's a couple weekend places down the road, but most of the time we'll have it all to ourselves. Which bag is your swimsuit in? Uh, the blue one. [Janna] Let's get the other stuff later. [Leslie] Okay. (tense music) (eerie music) Ooh, it's dark in here. Yeah, musty, too. No one's been here since last summer. Here, let me get the light. Oh, well, if it's all right with you, you can have the front bedroom. There's a bath next to it and I'm gonna take this one back here. Okay. [Janna] So hurry up. (insects chirping) (eerie music) (both chatting faintly) New sandals. (speaking faintly) I shoulda worn my swim shoes. Oh, it won't matter once you get on that dock and dive in. [Leslie] It's really nice. [Janna] Wait 'til we hit that water, that's when it'll be nice. [Leslie] Will it be cold? [Janna] No, it'll be just right. It'll cool you off, though. [Leslie] Sure. [Janna] Hold on, there's rafts up here (both chatting faintly) And the water temperature's fantastic. [Leslie] Is it gonna be cold? It's not cold, it's gonna be so warm. Are you gonna go in? Come on! [Leslie] Janna! (water splashing) [Janna] Come on, the water's great. I'm just sitting here. [Janna] Oh, come on. Aren't there fish in there? Oh, this feels great. It's so relaxing. Oh, just lay here. (Janna giggling) Oh, come on. There's a bug right here. Oh, it won't eat much. Come on. Great, Janna. (laughs) Okay, come on in. (Leslie squealing) Yay! It is nice. Ooh, it's colder on the bottom. Oh, it's refreshing. Come on, let's go to the other side. [Leslie] It's so nice here. Yeah, I've always loved it here. How long have you been coming here? Every summer since my parents split up. Don't you ever get bored without other kids around? Not really. I don't know, I always liked the people around here. Locals like Charlie. They're all right. A little deficient in the ambition department, maybe. But if they like you, they'll do anything for you. Charlie seems nice. Yeah, he's been great. And I've always felt, I don't know, like the lake is special. What do you mean? Just never felt as safe anywhere as I do here. Really? Why? I don't know. Most of it's probably my dad, though. Your mom never came here, did she? No, my dad bought this place so we could be together in the summers when he wasn't teaching. We'd come up here and he'd spend every morning writing and the rest of the time doing things with me. God, it was great. He'd read to me what he was writing and then he'd make up special stories just for me. You know, that kinda stuff. Like the one about the Indian named Tenkiller? [Janna] Yeah. God, I loved those stories. How'd that one go? Well, this Indian girl's little sister was stolen and killed by another tribe. So she got revenge on them by killing 10 of their bravest warriors, one by one. She killed the last one on this lake by wrapping herself around his body and pulling him under until they both drowned. It's not true, is it? No, of course not. Daddy just told me that story because I'd never been swimming in anything besides a pool. And I was afraid to swim in the lake, because I couldn't see the bottom. So Daddy said that the Indian girl's spirit lived at the bottom of the lake and protected brave, strong girls like us. It's silly, but I was only eight. Oh, I don't know, it kinda suits this place. It doesn't seem real here. Dreamlike, I guess I'd call it. Kinda makes me feel strange. (soft music) Well, you know, like you feel when you wake up and find out someone's been watching you sleep. (chuckles) Les, don't get weird on me. See that fisherman over there? Now, that's about the most dangerous thing on this lake. Some old fisherman who might come in the Cove and try to pinch your ass. Oh, just relax. Just try and forget about Josh. (soft music) (insects chirping) Huh? Call me sometime at the Cove. Sure. I usually have to work through the noon hour, but if you can call me after lunch, it'd be great. Okay. I'd ask you in, but the people that I'm staying with... if I had a guy in, they would kill me. So we better not this time. Sure. [Debbie] But seriously, call me, okay? Okay. [Debbie] Thanks. (car engine revs) Bye. Bye. (keys jingling) (crickets chirping) (footsteps plodding) (phone ringing) [Debbie] Hello? Oh, hi. Oh, it was all right. Yeah. (speaking faintly) Okay, bye. (hot tub motor roaring) (hot tub motor roaring) (water burbling) (Debbie gasps) Tor, what are you doing here? No! No! No! (whimpering) (Debbie gasping) No! No, Tor, no! (Debbie gasping) (Debbie crying) No, Tor! (water burbling) (Debbie gasping) (water burbling) (knife scraping) [Janna] Excuse me. [Preacher] Well, hello there. What can I do for you? Is Red around? Red? Nah, he ain't here this summer. He and his old lady took a mobile home and went to Alaska. I took over for him, kind of temporary. Oh, well, my boat's over there in Berth 18. Would you get it for us and gas it up? I can't let this boat out unless I know I'm giving it to the right party. My name is Janna McKinney and the boat is stored under my father's name, Aston McKinney. Will you get it now? We tried to come early so we could get out of your way before you got too busy. (ominous music) Yeah, I can do that. Tor, will you get the boat? Look where you stand, Leslie, you don't wanna fall in the lake. [Leslie] Hi, weren't you at the Cove yesterday? Yeah, I was. (ominous music) I'll go get your boat here. Thanks. Did you say his name was Tor? Tor? Yeah, short for Torah. Say, uh, what are you gonna do about this gasoline bill? Uh, your parents gonna come by and take care of it later? No, they won't. Look, mister...uh? Preacher, just call me Preacher. Preacher? Why do they call you that? I guess 'cause my daddy named me that. Hey, there's Tor with the boat. (boat motor humming) [Tor] Grab a hold, Preacher. Thanks, Tor. Oh, you're welcome. I checked it over a little bit and you have a couple hoses that look like they're pretty worn. Oh, we sure appreciate you checking it out for us. Are you a mechanic? Among other things. If you have a problem at all, call down here and as soon as I can get away, I'll come by and take a look at it. Well, thanks. We sure will. [Tor] Okay, you girls be careful out there. Do you have any life jackets? Yeah, I've already checked that out with Janna. I get a little nervous about going out on a lake without one. Thanks, Tor. Thanks, Preacher. Yeah, thanks, guys. Just put the gas on my bill, okay? See you later, Tor. [Tor] Sure. See you later. (boat motor revving) Well, well, well. Things are looking up around here. Those two sweet little 'ol things are gonna get mighty lonesome out here without anybody taking care of them. Matter of fact, lot of dirty old men out here with nasty minds. Guess I'll have to keep an eye on 'em. Shit, maybe I'll keep two eyes on 'em. You just watch it, old man. If you're half as smart as you think you are, you'll stay on this side of the lake. (crickets chirping) (pop music playing faintly on radio) (telephone ringing) I'll get it. Hello? Oh, hi, Josh. I know, I'm sorry, but I just had to get away for a while. From mom and dad..-and you. I just had to get away. (upbeat synth music) How'd you get this number? I told them not to give it to anyone. No, I'm not going to tell you where I am and please don't try to find me. 'Cause I just don't wanna see you right now. Josh, you don't mean that. You know you don't scare me anymore, because you sound just like what you've always been. A spoiled, overgrown predator who likes to push people around. (upbeat synth music cont.) (phone ringing) Hello? What do you want? Well, she just hung up on you, didn't she? So I don't think she wants to talk to you. (scoffs) Oh, God, you have a warped mind. Now, let me tell you something. Leave us alone, asshole, or I'm going to tell your mommy and daddy that their little boy likes to beat up on women. (receiver bangs) (phone ringing) Damn it, Josh, I'm warning you... Oh, hi, Charlie. Sorry about that. Oh, yes, Les' boyfriend is just giving her a hard time. (exhales deeply) So what's up? Yeah! Sure! Of course, she can handle it. Have I ever let you down? Okay, well, I'll come in early Monday morning and tell her to come in later, and then I can show her what to do. That's great, Charlie. Okay, see you Monday. (upbeat synth music) That was Charlie. His waitress walked out on him, so he wants you to work afternoons. By myself? Oh, sure. It's easy. Charlie comes in early and cooks up most of the lunch specials. Then I come to help with breakfast and lunch. By the time you get there, the lunch rush is over. All you'll have to do is cook up a few burgers and maybe serve some pie and coffee. What about the dinner crowds? Hm, Charlie doesn't worry much about being open at night during the week. There's just not that many people around. What about weekends? (chuckles) Now, that's a little different. But we'll work something out before then. So, um, do you wanna talk about this thing between you and Josh? No, I don't wanna talk about anything right now. All right. But just let me say one thing and then I'll shut up and go to bed. Now that Josh knows he can't push you around anymore, he's gonna start whining around about how much he needs you. And I know you, Les, you are a sucker for a stray dog. But you can't save people like Josh by sacrificing yourself. Now, you just remember that, okay? (crickets chirping) Maybe you can't save him no matter what you do. I know. (knocking) Preacher, what are you doing here? Oh, I just brought you girls some fish. They're all cleaned and filleted, and you won't have to worry about it. Oh, well, thanks. How'd you get here? We didn't hear a car drive up. I got no car. I've got that little old boat out there. It does me just fine. Oh, so you must be the guy we see fishing around here all the time. Yeah, that's me. You're liable to see a hell of a lot more of me, too. Hmm. Well, thanks, Preacher. Goodnight. Wait, uh, ain't you got a cold beer on a hot night like this? Oh, sorry. But we were just getting ready to go to bed. Goodnight. [Preacher] Goodnight. [Leslie] What'd Preacher want? He brought us some fish. He wanted to come in for a beer, but I told him we were just too tired. (sighs) Let's go to bed. We can sleep as late as we want and then get dressed up and go over to the lodge for brunch. Maybe that'll cheer us both up. You coming? Yeah, in a minute. (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping) (foreboding music) Who the hell's out there? (foreboding music) What's the matter, Preacher? Getting a little too old for your favorite nighttime activities? My god, Tor, you scared the shit outta me. No kidding. [Preacher] What are you doing here, anyway, Tor? Just checking up on you. Just checking on me? Hell, I ain't doing nothing. Just brought 'em over some fish. No harm intended. Yeah, I understand that, Preacher. Your kind never does mean any harm. What do you mean my kind? I mean the kind of man that sees something perfect and new, and beautiful, he covers it with his filth. The kinda man that sees something with his eyes, hands and mind, and pulls it down into the dirt with him. (ominous music) What's the matter? Am I getting in your way, Tor? You heard what I said, old man. Yeah, I heard. And I'm old. I'm too old to take any shit from a young smartass like you. Who the hell are you, anyway? Some rich man's bastard? Nobody knows anything about you. White trash. I think I better hang around here and take care of those girls. Now, get outta my way. (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (Preacher grunting) (crickets chirping) [Tor] Warned you, Preacher. I told you to stay on your side of the lake. But no, you wouldn't listen to me, would you? No. White trash, huh? (crickets chirping) (chuckles) White trash. (crickets chirping) ("Beautiful Dreamer" playing) [Leslie] Just before I got into bed, Janna told me Debbie, the waitress at the Cove, had been killed and Denise, the missing waitress, was found. Parts of her body were found floating in the lake. (crickets chirping) (crickets chirping) ("Beautiful Dreamer" playing) (crickets chirping) (eerie music) Janna, honestly, someday, somebody's gonna really let you have it. Why didn't you call out to me? I don't know. For a minute there, it looked like you were sleepwalking. What are you doing down here? Well, I think I heard something. Music, I think, and look, whose boat is this? Ugh, there's no telling. Someone down the road just probably parked in the wrong dock. It's hard to see out on the lake at night. It doesn't matter. Let's get back up to the house before the mosquitoes eat us alive. Okay. I'm hungry. What'd you hear'? I think it was a harmonica. (eerie, foreboding music) Les, s0mething's wrong with the boat. I'm gonna call the marina. Do you still wanna go over to the lodge? Sure, we'll just take the car. You know that other boat that was on the dock? It's gone. Hi. Who's this? Oh, hi, Tor. Yeah, I guess we must have blown one of those hoses on the boat after the workout we gave it yesterday. Yeah, it just turns over and sputters. Really? So when do you think you can get away? Right. Okay, well, I sure appreciate it. Thanks. You ready? Yep. Okay, Preacher hasn't showed up for work yet this morning, so it's gonna be a while 'til Tor can get away. Let me just turn this thing on. Okay. (phone ringing) Hi, this is Janna. I'm at 823-9507. I'm not in right now, but if you wish to leave a message, please do so at the tone. (device beeps) [Menacing Voice] I'm going to get you.

(tape whirs) [Menacing Voice] I'm going to get you. (tape whirs) (eerie music) I'm going to get you. (tape whirs) I'm going to get you. (tape whirs) (knocking) (tense music) Well, hi, Tor. Come on in. Hi, Janna. Uh, I went down and took a look at the motor and it's just a minor problem. But thing is, I'm gonna have to go into town tomorrow to get the part. Hm, well, I sure appreciate you going to all that trouble. Well, just part of the service here, ma'am. Well, the least I can do is offer you a cold beer. Have you got some time? Sure, it's too hot out thereto have to go back out. Well, good. Sit down. I'll give us both one. [Tor] Thank you. (insects chirping) [Janna] Here you go. Need a glass? No, this is fine. Thanks. You sure look nice. Well, thanks, Tor. Did Preacher ever come back today? Uh, no, he's probably sleeping it off somewhere. Yeah, he told us he had a weakness for booze and women. He showed up here last night, supposedly to give us some fish. He didn't bother you, did he? No. No, he wanted to come in. But I'm pretty good at getting rid of men I don't want hanging around. This is a pretty nice place. [Janna] Thanks. I think so. It's really what I think of when I think of home. Charlie told me you'd been coming up here for quite a long time. Say, uh, where's Leslie? She didn't leave, did she? Oh, no, no. She's just taking a nap. [Tor] Oh, I thought Charlie said you were both starting to work at the Cove tomorrow. We are. Les is kind of worn out. She's got a scumbag of a boyfriend who's really been giving her a hard time lately. Oh, and she takes everything much too seriously. What's with the boyfriend? I don't know. He's a small town, big wheel who likes to throw his weight around. And Leslie's, too, when she doesn't do exactly what he wants her to. Does he beat her? Not exactly, but Les is afraid it's coming to that. And then on the other hand, he says that he loves her and she can't stand to hurt anyone. Not even that piece of slime. God, I hate him. I just don't understand guys like that. But Leslie's lucky to have a friend like you. Well, I try to help her out, but sometimes, I think she's just a born victim. So can I get you another beer? No, thanks. I better be getting back to the marina. Sure wish you could stay a little while longer. I'd like to get to know you better. You will, Janna, I promise. Bye-bye. Thanks. (foreboding music) Janna. [Janna] Oh, hi. Did you get any sleep? I dozed a little. Was that Tor? Yeah, he's gotta go in town tomorrow to get the part and then he'll be able to fix the boat. Is something wrong? Well, I wasn't gonna say anything, but I really think you need to hear this. What? This. (tape whirs) [Menacing Voice] I'm going to get you. Is that Josh's voice? I can't tell. Let me hear it again. (tape whirs) [Menacing Voice] I'm going to get you. I just can't tell. (tense music) [Janna] Let's go sit down and talk about it. It's really scary. It's just like something he'd do. Call up and leave a creepy message like that. You know it is. Well, what do you think we should do? Ignore him. He's just trying to scare you, or me, or both of us. Shit, he makes me mad. What does he think you're going to do? Fall into his arms because you're scared of a voice? I just don't know how to handle this. Well, it looks like Preacher's back, fishing as usual. Now there's another worthless man for ya. I wonder just how long Tor's gonna put up with him. Oh, I don't know. Tor seems to be pretty easygoing. He's a really nice guy. Yeah, very nice. ("Beautiful Dreamer" playing) ("Beautiful Dreamer" cont.) (tense music) [Janna] He could kill you someday. (voice echoing) Kill you someday. (voice echoing) (sinister laughing) [Josh] I'm gonna get even with you. (voice echoing) (tense music cont.) [Preacher] Sometimes, it's pure pleasure. (echoing) A good, honed knife. (voice echoing) Knife. (voice echoing) [Leslie] Like you feel when you wake up and you find out somebody's been watching you sleep. (voice echoing) Find out somebody's been watching you sleep(voice echoing) (tense music) (Leslie screaming) (crickets chirping) (phone ringing) Hello? What? Who is this? Josh, is that you? Stop it, Josh. Just stop it! I know it's you and I'm... (Leslie exhales sharply) (phone dial clicking) Janna, he called again. Just now. Oh, I don't know. He said my name and called me beautiful. And the last thing he said was, "Forever mine." Yeah, I think it was him. I just don't know who else it would be. Yeah, I'm okay. No, it's a little funny, but I'm not really scared at all. I don't know why. Okay. No, I can walk. I'll be careful. I'll be there as soon as I can get cleaned up. Okay. Bye-bye. (birds chirping) (water lapping) It was clear to me that the dream I had the night before was trying to tell me something. I wish now I had told Janna about it. Maybe we both would've gone home then. (Leslie humming) (Leslie humming) You okay? Yeah, just a little shaky. Well, did you eat anything? Want some breakfast? Maybe in a little while. This water's fine for now. All right. So tell me exactly what he said. Well, the first thing he said was, "Beautiful Leslie." And then he said, "| want you, I'm going to get you." Like he said the other time. And I think he said, "Forever mine." Then he hung up. [Janna] Are you sure it was Josh? I'm pretty sure. Well, you sure are calm about it. I thought you would be really upset. Well, I guess I've finally come around to believing what you've always said, that Josh is mostly a lot of talk and if I just stand up for myself, then he'll back down. I think I'm tired of being sweet little Leslie. I've gotta make some changes. You know, I had this horrible dream last night. I don't really remember what happened, but you were in it. And Josh. I didn't get back to sleep until dawn. I don't know what all this means, but I feel like I've gotta do something about it. Well, hallelujah, sister. It's about time. I thought Josh had managed to scare you and I think that's exactly what he's trying to do. [Leslie] But why? (scoffs) Out of meanness, like a nasty little kid who's unhappy and tries to make everyone else miserable, too. I think you're right, Les, I really do. Besides, he doesn't seem to know exactly where you are. Not yet, anyway. Well, your parents won't tell him, will they? I hope not. I asked them not to. Well, let's get busy and stop giving this more attention than it deserves. Come on into the kitchen and I will transform you into a world class short-order cook and waitress. [Leslie] Okay. Oh, it feels good to sit down for a while. I think I'm outta shape for this job. I thought you were going home around one. Hmm, I thought I'd stick around for a while. Jan, I told you I'd be fine. Look, there's Tor. [Janna] Oh. (door creaks) Hi, Tor. You wanna come over and sit with us? Sure. Hi, Janna. How you doing? [Janna] Hey, pretty good. How about yourself? Uh, just hot. Real hot. [Leslie] Well, can I get you anything? How about a big glass of iced tea and a piece of pie? Okay, we have apple, coconut cream and one piece of peach. How about apple? Oh, okay. Be right back with it. Boy, you look a little tired. Hmm, I forgot how much work this job is. [Tor] Yeah, I guess it isn't easy being a waitress. Um-hmm. So what have you been up to? Oh, just cleaning up some things I'd been putting off. I'm gonna go into town here a little later and pick up that part for the boat and, uh, then I'll come by and put it on. Probably not until after six o'clock, though. I have some other things I have to do. Sure. Any time's fine. (chuckles) ls Preacher back? Yeah, he's around. Good, then maybe you'll have time for a beer or something when you come over. Here you go. Thank you. Janna, really, why don't you go on home? I'll be okay. [Janna] Well, I didn't think you'd wanna stay here alone. Look, you need to stop babysitting me. I'm a big girl now and I need to start acting like one. Besides, Tor's here now, and isn't Charlie due back? Well, yeah, he is, but this is the first time he's been able to get off in a month and I can't see him exactly rushing back. [Leslie] I'll be fine. Are you sure? [Leslie] I'm sure. Well, okay. I could use a nap and a swim. I'll come pick you up at closing time. And don't you forget to come by the house for that beer. Oh, I don't know. You go get some rest. All right, see y'all later. Bye. (Leslie sighs) [Tor] Problems? Nothing new. Boyfriend? [Leslie] Did Janna tell you? She just told me that he was giving you a bad time. Not any details. You know, Janna's awful protective of you. Is there anything I can do? No, he's just calling up and saying weird things. You know...threatening me. Well, can't you call the police or something? Oh, no, I wouldn't wanna do that. For one thing, he may not even know where I am. For another, I think he's just trying to scare me. Besides, it would really hurt a lot of other people. And what about you? Don't you get hurt? ("Beautiful Dreamer" playing) Well, I think this just must be one of those things I have to go through to grow up. You see, I've never dated anyone but Josh. I've never wanted to and I've never taken care of myself. I've never been alone. I've never made any of my own decisions. Do you love him? Sometimes, I think I do. Yet sometimes, I don't see how I can. Leslie, you're so beautiful and you shouldn't have to worry about some guy that wants to hurt you. You can have any man that you wanted. That's a really sweet thing to say, Tor. Well, I guess I better get to those dishes before Charlie gets back. Yeah, I gotta go back into town. Say, uh, don't I owe you some money? Oh, forget it. Are you sure? Sure. Aren't you Charlie's best customer? Thanks, Leslie. Maybe I'll see you later. [Janna] Oh, it's gonna be great. (water splashes) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) Darn, it would rain. (thunder rumbling) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (crickets chirping) (foreboding music) (crickets chirping) (eerie music) Janna. Janna. (gasps) Tor. God, I must've fallen asleep. What time is it? How did you get here? [Tor] Came over in Preacher's boat. Oh, and when are you gonna be able to get the part for our boat? Uh, I'll have to order it. Hmm. How long will that take? Probably a couple days. (thunder rumbling) Hey, how about that beer? Sure. Let's go up to the house. (crickets chirping) (thunder rumbling) (phone ringing) This is the Cove. What? Look, Josh, I've just about had enough of this. I can't believe you're doing this. And I'm not impressed. Goodbye. (water splashing) (foreboding music) (thunder rumbling) (eerie music) (thunder booming) (harmonica trilling) (water splashing) (harmonica trilling) (thunder rumbling) (phone cable clicking) (phone dial clicking) (crickets chirping) (thunder rumbling) (tense music) (tense music cont.) [Janna] What are you doing? What? Tor, what are you -what are doing? (dramatic music) (water splashing) (buttons thudding) (phone ringing) (footsteps plodding) (crickets chirping) Janna, are you here? (foreboding music) (tense music) (rain pattering) Janna!Janna! (thunder rumbling) Are you trying to scare me? (Leslie screaming) (dramatic music) (Leslie crying) (Leslie screaming) Janna's dead! Josh has killed her! Calm down, calm down! I just came down to the house to check on the boat. Let's go back up here and we'll figure out what we're gonna do. (Leslie whimpering) (dramatic music) I think you better go find the car keys. He may be hanging around somewhere. I'll call the Sheriff and try to get him out here. (dramatic music) (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) (dramatic music) Go on. I'll be right here. (Leslie whimpering) (brooding music) (suspenseful music) Here they are. Did you call the Sheriff? [Tor] No, the line was busy. I'll call back later. Okay. I wonder where Josh is. He could be anywhere. (tense music) Did you see the harmonica on the counter? I keep wondering where that came from. (harmonica trilling) It's yours? It's mine. (tense music) But why? She was asking for it. You know she was. She was getting in the way. In the way? Between us. (Leslie whimpering) I've wanted you ever since I first saw you, Leslie. You're the most perfect woman I've ever known. So sweet. You need someone like me to protect you. But they were gonna spoil you and make you hard, like Janna. I won't them, Leslie. I won't let them. (sinister eerie music) (dramatic music) (Leslie gasping) (tense music) Leslie, come back. (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (door latch clicks) [Josh] Leslie, Janna? Anybody home? (tense music) (dramatic music) (tense music) (crickets chirping) -Josh? (tense music) Josh? Josh! (crickets chirping) Josh? (panting) (light switch clicks) (whimpering) Josh (Leslie screaming) (Leslie sobbing) (Leslie gasping) Leslie, why did you run away? I asked you to come back. (Leslie panting) You should've listened. Didn't I fix it so Josh would never hurt you again? (crickets chirping) Leslie, I love you. Nobody loves you as much as I do and that makes you mine. (crickets chirping) (tense music) (water splashing) (crickets chirping) (tense music) (eerie music) Leslie. (eerie music) (crickets chirping) (Tor grunting) (water splashing) Leslie! (Tor gasping) (Leslie gasping) Leslie! (Tor gasping) (water splashing) Leslie, I love... Come back! Leslie! (Tor gasping) (crickets chirping) (water splashing) Leslie! [Leslie] Being a swimmer saved my life. [Tor] Come back! [Leslie] If anything positive came out of this experience, it was the lesson I learned... Leslie! [Leslie] To never let anyone make you do anything you don't want to do. Poor Janna. She wanted to help me so. I just thank God that Tor is now at the bottom of the lake. I really think that Indian maiden Janna talked about pulled him under and got revenge for her. At least the young women who come to the lake next summer won't have to be afraid anymore.
