He probably bumped into Harvey or some other friend of his. I'’m sure he'’ll call. >> Kenny, we'’ve got to have him looked over. I can'’t handle this. >> Don'’t start this again. >> You'’re as stubborn as he is. >> I'’ll see you at home. >> You'’re just never going to find me leading one of those lives of quiet desperation.

Yeah, the Harrisons used to live on West Pike. Dick and Evelyn. Maybe you remember them? >> Don'’t believe I do. >> Oh, yeah, they'’re dead now, the both of '’em. How long'’s the circus gonna be here? I'’ve got a granddaughter that'’s supposed to visit next month. >> Just the weekend. >> Oh. >> Bonnie was in here looking for you, Tom. >> Oh, yee-gods. I forgot, I was supposed to meet my daughter-in-law here. Uh, what time you got, Patty? >> Half past 4:00. >> You'’re kidding. Well, thanks for the pie. >> You need a ride home? >> No, no, it'’s not a long walk, and I know a shortcut. >> Why don'’t you come by tonight or tomorrow night? Look for me. I'’m the guy in the top hat. >> You got it. >> Okay. >> Oh, no, no, Ivy, there'’s nothing to worry about, just ask Harvey if he'’s seen him. Okay. Yeah, I will. I'’ll let you know. Okay. >> Now, where is that darn path? I know it'’s along here someplace, isn'’t it? We used to take it going to the Brownings, remember, hon'’? I don'’t know, I'’d swore it was right along here someplace. And I-- now, wait a minute. Hey, wait a minute. There it is, see? I knew I hadn'’t lost all my marbles. Ow! Oh, oh... Oh... Ow. Oh. Oh... [bird cawing] Ow. Oh... Oh... Hello? Hello, anybody out there? Hello? >> He'’s about 5'’10", 5'’11", I think, isn'’t he? >> Used to be. People kinda shrink when they get older. >> He just cashed his Social Security check. >> Um, there'’s not much we can really do tonight. You call me first thing in the morning if he hasn'’t shown up. >> We will. >> Ow. Oh, boy. Oh... Kids must be fit to be tied. [coughs] Oh! Ahh... Ha ha. I'’ll tell '’em that I was kidnapped and held for ransom until I overcame my captors and made my escape unscathed. Hah. Ow. Well, maybe a little scathed. >> Hi. >> When did you see him last? >> Bonnie dropped him off in front of the bank yesterday around 1:00. But we know he was in the coffee shop about 3:30, 4:00. >> You sure he didn'’t say anything about... visiting a friend? >> Nope. And we'’ve called everyone. >> He'’s gettin'’ on a bit. Maybe he just forgot to tell you where he was going. Is he okay? >> He gets dizzy sometimes, loses his balance. That'’s why we moved him in with us. >> He can'’t have gotten very far. Let'’s give it a couple more hours-- my guess is, he'’ll turn up safe and sound. >> And if he doesn'’t? >> We'’ll go and find him for you. Deal? >> God. Let her drop. >> Thank you so much. How'’d you hurt your leg? >> Ah, it happened yesterday. I was trying to climb a tree. You shouldn'’t be in such a hurry. >> Funny thing is, I'’m not. >> Spare'’s still a little soft. Better check it at the next station. >> Is there anywhere to eat around here? I could use some breakfast. >> Well, there'’s Hilly'’s Inn. Food'’s not great, but it won'’t kill you, I guess. I don'’t know about the rooms. It'’s about a mile down the road, if you'’re not too fussy. >> Life is risk. Which way are you headed? >> That way. >> Oh, well, hop in. >> I'’m Leanne, hi. >> Tom. That one word or two? >> I'’m sorry? >> Leanne. One word or two? >> One. No one calls me Lee and lives to tell about it. >> Got it. >> So, where am I, anyway? >> Kansas. >> Oh, I know that, I meant where in Kansas? >> Oh, about 150 miles this side of Wichita. You might'’ve heard of Wichita. And the nearest town is Beaumont, that'’s a mile and a half back that way. Where you headed? >> California. >> Oh, whereabouts? >> Carmel. Up near San Francisco. >> Is that anywhere near Monterey? >> Right next door. >> I'’ll be damned. >> Why? >> I just got a letter from somebody in Monterey, California the other day. >> You have friends in Monterey? >> No, not-- not-- well, not exactly. I'’ve got a friend, maybe. >> Oh. Hmm. >> I'’ll be damned. >> 55 years? You'’re kidding! >> She kept tabs on me, she says, through an old girlfriend of hers. >> Who was she? >> Her name is Veronica. Deacy, Veronica Deacy. >> No, I mean, who was she? >> Oh. We almost got married once. >> Almost. I hate that word. >> Unless you almost fell off a roof. >> No, I didn'’t mean it like that, I meant it the other way. "Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: it might have been." You know, like that. >> That'’s a quote, I guess. >> So, why didn'’t you? Marry Veronica Deacy? >> Oh, that'’s a long story. [door opens, slams] Why are you going to California? >> Oh, I live there. My family does. It'’s home. >> Your heart there? >> I'’m sorry? >> "Home is where the heart is." That'’s a quote. >> Oh. What do you do? Work-wise. >> I was a cabinetmaker. >> What are you now? >> Nothing. >> Nobody'’s nothing. >> Well, I'’m retired. >> Oh, I am never gonna retire. I don'’t know what I'’ll be retiring from, but I know I'’m not going to do it. >> Sometimes you have to. They make you. Oh, golly, that reminds me. Excuse me, I'’ll be right back. >> How ya doin'’? >> I'’m doing fine, how are you doing? >> Travelin'’ with your granddad, are ya? >> No, he'’s not my granddad, I'’m just with him. >> Did ya hear that? Says she'’s "with him." I think she'’s pulling some leg here, don'’t you? >> She can pull on mine anytime. >> What'’s your name, sweetheart? >> Ophelia. >> Ooh, that'’s a pretty name. What do you say me and you ditch old granddad here for a bit, get to know each other some. >> Oh, he'’s really not my grandfather. He'’s my lover. You see, I used to be a hooker. Until I met George, and then he just turned my life around. Now we'’re engaged. >> You'’re quite the little smartass, ain'’t ya? >> What'’s my tab? >> Seven even. >> You ought to get that phone fixed. >> Yeah, I know. >> Why won'’t you believe me? Do I look like a dishonest person? I mean, I know it'’s hard to believe, but so many things are these days, haven'’t you noticed that? >> How'’d you like to notice a smack in the mouth, you wise-ass little bitch? >> Let'’s go. >> Let go, you Neanderthal. >> Huh? >> Don'’t do that. >> Your little girl here'’s got quite the mouth on her, ain'’t she. >> Let go! >> Hey, hey! >> Come on now, Russ. >> Let'’s just see if it tastes sweeter than it talks, eh? >> Russell, knock it off now! >> You old son-of-a-bitch! >> Hey, Russ, come on, take it easy! >> Hey, cowboy. >> Aah! >> Let'’s call it a day, son. >> Aah! >> Do me a favor, mister, and get this girl outta here! >> Well, the restaurant wasn'’t all that great, I think we should pass on the motel. What do you think? [car alarm chirps] >> I think that we should hurry right along out of here as fast as we can. [engine starts] >> You called everywhere? >> Unless he'’s got a buddy or two I don'’t know about, and I don'’t think so. They'’re dropping like flies. >> You check the hospital? >> Three times. They'’re getting tired of hearing my voice. >> Well, could be he'’s lost, wandering around someplace. >> Oh, come on, Pete. Dad could walk the whole county blindfolded at midnight. >> Well, maybe not anymore. I don'’t know if all his gears are meshing lately. Better let the sheriff handle it, go home and wait it out. >> Go home and wait it out? We'’re not talking about the family dog here. >> Kenny, I think you'’re overreacting. >> Better than not reacting at all! Look, I know you two don'’t always see eye to eye, but-- >> He'’s got you right where he wants you, just like always. >> You don'’t know what you'’re talking about. >> I hate to say I told you so. But if we'’d done my idea... >> I hope someday your kids'’ll say they want to put you in a nursing home. You might see things differently then. >> Yeah, well, at least they'’ll know where to find me. >> I take it that was Mace. >> I think I used it all up. Wow, you were great. With the stick. My hero. >> It scared the hell outta me. Felt good after, though. >> Gee, I'’ve never been in one of these before. It'’s like floating on air. >> Yeah, it was a present from my father. >> Let me know when you want me to drop you. How far are you going? >> Uh-oh. Do you think that they'’re coming after us? Maybe they'’re not coming after us. >> Maybe they liked the Mace so much, they'’re coming back for more. >> What do you think? >> I think we'’d better not let '’em catch us is what I think. >> Good thinking. >> I'’m really sorry about this. >> Watch it! [car horn honking] >> Let'’s get out of here. [phone ringing] [ringing continues] >> Hello? >> Hello, Bonnie? It'’s me! Tom! [whirring, clanging] It'’s Tom! Tom! >> Tom? Tom is that you? I can'’t... >> I want you to know I'’m all right! I said, "I'’m all right!" Hey, would you fellas knock that off for just a second? [whirring, clanging] [muttering] I'’ll call you back when I find another phone, huh? >> Tom, where are you? Tom! [dial tone] >> It'’s gonna take a week to restore it to some semblance of its former glory. >> [groaning] >> How'’s your leg? >> Fella goes to a doctor, he says, "Doc, every time I do this, it hurts." Doc said, "Don'’t do it." >> [laughing] >> That joke is so old, that only someone as young as you could laugh at it. How'’s your elbow? >> Girl goes to a doctor, says, "Doc, it hurts when I go--" So where were you heading when fate threw us so dangerously together? >> Ah, home. >> Where your heart is? >> My heart is not there. >> Why not? >> It'’s not my home. >> I lost my home recently. Sold it. I live with my son and daughter-in-law now. >> You have a wife? >> She passed away. Be three years this April. >> I'’m sorry. >> It gets easier, so they say. >> How many kids? >> [chuckling] Two daughters in Florida. Two sons here. Two daughters-in-law, seven grandkids. One of the daughters-in-law is in the process of not being that. >> Ah. Marital discord? >> Pete'’s wife. She'’s been cheating on him for years. >> Well, do you have any brothers or sisters? >> Had a brother and three sisters. They'’re all gone now. >> I'’m an only child. You don'’t sound too thrilled with your living arrangements. >> Well, my arm got twisted a bit. I get a touch of high blood pressure now and then. I'’m fine, but the kids got all in a panic. >> Well, at least you'’re with your family. My boyfriend'’s parents put his grandmother in an old age home last year-- she lasted two months, and that was it. >> That can happen, they tell me. You'’ve got a boyfriend, huh? >> Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Though I kind of feel like I need my space right now. >> I know that feeling. [both laughing] >> Well, you got a week to kill before you get your car. >> No, I'’ll just pick it up on the way back. >> From where? >> California. >> Uh-huh. Well, what are you-- you gonna rent a car, you gonna fly out? >> No, I'’m gonna hitchhike. >> What? Hitchhike! What the heck would make you do a damn fool thing like that? >> It'’s what I wanted to do in the first place. It was written. >> Huh? >> It'’s an Arabic thing. >> It'’s what they say when they believe that something was meant to be. "It was written." You gonna get home all right? >> Sure. How'’d you like some company? >> What do you mean? >> To California. How would you like some company? >> What company? >> [silent] >> You'’re putting me on. >> I'’ve got money, plenty. I cashed my check yesterday. >> Wait, wait. You'’re telling me you want to go to California? With me? Just like that? >> Just like that'’s maybe the best way, maybe the only way. And I won'’t slow you up. >> You really want to hitchhike to California? >> You better say yes or no, before I lose my nerve. >> But you don'’t have your clothes or your toothbrush or anything. And what about your kids? >> I'’ll call '’em at the next stop, and I'’ll buy whatever I need along the way as I need it. >> You'’re serious. >> It was written. >> He gave you no indication where he was calling from? >> He might'’ve. I couldn'’t hear. It sounded like maybe he was in a lotta trouble, and he couldn'’t talk. >> Let'’s not go jumping to conclusions just yet. We'’ll do a little poking around, see what we can find. >> At least we know he didn'’t get hit by a car or anything. >> Your Dad got a beef with anybody? >> Nobody I can think of. Except maybe his doctor for telling him not to drive. >> This is harder than I thought. >> I'’ve got an idea. Why don'’t I go back in the bushes, and then when a car stops, which I have no doubt they will do for you, you tell'’ em that you'’re saddled with a guy with a bum ankle, and up I'’ll pop. Now, they gotta be too embarrassed to turn us down unless they'’re totally lacking in human feelings. >> A distinct possibility. Do you think it'’ll work? >> Well it did for Claudette Colbert. >> Who? >> In a movie. Here comes one. [silent] >> So he got extremely upset. You know, he couldn'’t understand. If only he'’d had the courage to understand. You know, sometimes it takes courage to understand. Courage is character. Character is destiny. You know what I mean. >> Took the words right out of my mouth. >> Here'’s where I turn off. Maybe you can pick up a ride. There'’s a bus that'’ll stop, though, if you flag it. >> Thanks a lot! >> Much obliged. >> Hey, what was she talking about, do you know? >> I'’m working on it. >> Your father is gonna be upset about that car. >> Not really. He'’ll just be glad I wasn'’t hurt. You, too, of course. >> Oh, that'’s nice to hear. I know those who'’d be more upset about the car than those who were in it. >> Not my Dad. He'’s one of the good ones. >> What'’s he do? >> He was a lawyer. >> Retired, is he? >> No. Not exactly. It'’s kind of a long story. How far'’s the next town, do you know? >> A real town? 60 miles? Maybe more. >> Oh, my God. That is amazing. I never knew anybody who could do that. >> I never knew anybody who thought that was amazing before. >> [laughing] >> Hey, there'’s the bus! >> There'’s only one unit left. >> In the nick of time, fortune smiles. >> Maybe we should try the next one along. >> Why? We'’ll take it. >> I'’m her granddad. >> $32 for a double. Coffee shop opens at seven. >> I haven'’t had a shower in two days. Maybe you were beginning to notice! >> I thought it was me. >> Oh, I hate you. How'’s it feeling? >> I think it'’s gonna take a microwave to thaw it out. >> Well, the swelling'’s gone down. >> Yeah. >> We'’ll just get a bandage and wrap it up. It'’ll be okay. >> I hope so. >> So what are your plans for the millennium? >> Huh? The what? >> New Year'’s Eve, 2000. The 21st Century. It'’s gonna be here before you know it. >> Well, I never thought about that. I don'’t know, I hope I'’m still alive, I guess. >> Oh, morbid. Me, I'’m gonna be in Paris. New Year'’s Eve, me on top of the Eiffel Tower. I don'’t know about you, but I am wiped. Please tell me that you don'’t snore. >> No, no... Nope, don'’t snore. [faucet running] Oh... >> How come you didn'’t come to bed? >> I did come to bed. >> Well, I meant all the way. >> I came far enough. >> You didn'’t even get undressed. >> Well, you got undressed enough for the both of us. >> Are you a morning grump, by any chance? >> No. Ow. >> You'’re upset. Why are you upset? >> Well, I may be an old man, but I'’m not that old, damn it! >> What old? >> For you to be doing a damn striptease right in front of me! >> Striptease? I got undressed, I was going to bed! >> I couldn'’t help but notice that. >> Why are you so upset? Jeez, you'’re like my grandfather! >> I'’m not your grandfather. And even if I were... >> That'’s not what I meant! What I meant was, you'’re old! >> That'’s not what I meant. That'’s not what I meant! >> Eaten yet? >> No, I waited for you. >> Coffee and orange juice, please. >> Have you chilled out? I mean, are you still mad? >> I know what chilled out means. >> Oh, you'’re not that old. I'’m sorry. >> I shouldn'’t have flown off the handle. >> Sure you should'’ve. It was insulting, what I did. I didn'’t-- I didn'’t mean to insult you, I just-- I wasn'’t thinking, you know? I'’m really sorry, really. >> Let'’s order. I'’m so hungry I could eat Nebraska. >> It'’s on me. >> No, let'’s split it. You already paid me enough last night. >> Don'’t pay any attention to her, she has a twisted sense of humor. >> So what do you think? >> About what? >> Me going to see Veronica, Ronnie. >> Oh, I think it'’d be cool. >> Yeah, why? >> For freedom. >> You know what I mean? >> No. >> "Freedom is the length of the chain between the imagination and the stake of reality." >> I'’ll have to think that one over. >> I spent ten days on a reservation last summer. This really amazing Native American woman gave it to me. It'’s supposed to help guide me towards my purpose. >> And what is your purpose? >> I'’ll know it when I get to it. >> Well, look who'’s here! >> What, you know this guy? [all silent] >> California? Last time I saw this guy, he was on his way home. Which was about 20 minutes away two days ago. >> He'’s taking the long way. >> The scenic route. >> Well, I wish I could take you all the way. >> We'’re about three hours from our next stop. You see the show in Beaumont? >> Never made it. >> I didn'’t know there were little circuses still traveling around. >> When I was a kid, I always wanted to run away with the circus. >> And now, for the 11:00 news update. Authorities in Beaumont are looking for an elderly man who has been missing since Friday. Thomas Gerrin is described as being 75 years old, about 5'’10", and 170 pounds. >> That'’d be me. >> He was last seen at a restaurant near Beaumont on Friday afternoon in the company of a young girl in her early 20'’s with blonde hair and wearing a red leather jacket. >> That'’d be you. >> Relatives fear Mr. Gerrin may have suffered a loss of memory or some other disorienting episode, but the possibility of foul play has not been ruled out. If you have any information as to the whereabouts of this man, contact... >> What'’s going on? >> I suffered a disorienting episode. >> Oh, don'’t look at me! I had nothing to do with it. You have got to call your kids. >> What the hell'’s the matter with them? Spreading it all over the radio like that. >> You just walked off without telling anyone? >> Well, I'’m over 21. I can do what I damn well please. Couple of dizzy spells, and they treat you like a little child. >> At least let them know you'’re okay. >> I will. I will. >> Call '’em and tell '’em you ran away with the circus. >> Yeah. >> Do you know anything about this girl? >> Not a thing. >> You think maybe she and your dad might'’ve been up to something? >> Like what? >> Some kinda May-December situation? >> Are you kidding me? We'’re talking Tom Gerrin here. >> Fella over in Dexter, 80 years old, just had a kid with his 26-year-old wife. It was in the paper a couple of weeks back. >> My father was married to the same woman for 50 years. He hasn'’t got any interest in women anymore, least of all a girl young enough to be his granddaughter. >> Happens more than you think. >> I'’m tellin'’ ya. He'’s not getting enough oxygen to the brain. Had an uncle on my mother'’s side went through the same thing. This is how it starts. >> Excuse me, Sheriff. You got a call. >> They'’re not gone but a couple-- three hours. It was him. I got his name right here on the register. Hers too. They shared a room. >> I'’d have called quicker, but I just now heard it, on the radio. [people cheering] >> Ah-oo! >> [silent] [bell dinging] >> Winner! >> Thank you. ♪ ♪ >> Have you got something slow? >> Mm-hmm. >> Great. Excuse me. ♪ ♪ >> I haven'’t danced for a long time. >> Oh, it'’s like riding a bike. >> Yeah, haven'’t done that lately, either. >> So, you haven'’t called them yet, have you? >> Have you seen a phone? God, you'’d think I was some kind of a fugitive from justice, wouldn'’t you? The way they put it out like that on the radio. That ticks me off. >> I bet you were a good father. >> I did the best I could, you know, at the time. I supported '’em, sent '’em to college, those that wanted to go. If that'’s not enough, then shoot me. Of course, they'’ve all got a grievance, you know. That'’s the fashion. I got a daughter who says I was distant. My shop was 15 yards from the house, she saw me every day of her life. "Distant." What kind of bull is that? >> About how long? >> They caught a ride, about an hour ago. >> They'’ll be well over the state line by now. I got no jurisdiction. I'’ll send a fax. >> How could he do this to us, after all we'’ve done for him? >> Honey, we don'’t know the whole story. And what'’ve we ever done for him that was so special, anyway? >> I broke my back with that yard sale. I invited him to come live in my house. You think he'’d take his medicine if I didn'’t force him to twice a day? >> He'’s my father. What'’s the alternative? Don'’t answer that. >> Kenny, you know I love him. But he'’s Pete'’s father, too. And your sisters, what about them? Why are we the only ones who care? >> Pete'’d put him in a home. He'’s already as much as told me. >> Kenny, this was supposed to be our time. The kids are finally out of the house, and now we'’ve got Tom to worry about. It'’s like having another child. >> No, it'’s not. We are not responsible for him every moment. >> Kenny, look at me. >> We have not made love since the day your father moved in here. >> For God'’s sake, Bonnie, do we have to talk about this now? >> When would you like to talk about it, Kenny? We can'’t talk about it when he'’s back. >> Well, maybe he won'’t be back. Would that make you happy? >> Thank you. >> You'’re welcome. What'’s that? >> This-- a plane. >> Let'’s see. >> Be careful, it'’s very sharp. >> It'’s kind of beautiful, isn'’t it? For a tool. >> Kinda came into my mind to keep it. Everything was being sold off. >> Why? >> I told you, I'’m retired. >> How come? >> I just got old. >> Oh, right. I keep forgetting. >> Could I have a coffee please? >> Right. >> What would your boyfriend think about you hitchhiking across the country? >> Not much. Besides, he doesn'’t really tell me what to do, so... >> You'’ve got a long freedom chain, huh? >> You remembered. >> I gave it some thought. You think he'’s gonna wanna take you back once you decide you'’ve had enough "space"? >> He picked me '’cause he knew I wouldn'’t stay. >> You'’re kidding. >> No, it'’s all subconscious. See, me, soon as I get into a relationship with someone really normal and nice, someone I can really count on, I run screaming for the hills. I had a shrink who told me once it'’s because I don'’t believe there is such a thing as a healthy marriage. >> Why not? >> You ever seen one? >> I was in one. >> Your wife think so, too? >> Far as I know. The subject never came up. I'’m not saying it was perfect. You know, I had a temper when I was younger. She just got quiet. I think quiet is worse than yelling, if you ask me. >> Yeah, we don'’t yell. Repression is really big where I come from. >> Then you'’ll be looking over at her sitting on the couch, 30 years later, and your heart kinda hurts because you love her so much. Comes and goes. You gotta be in it for the long haul, I guess. >> You miss her a lot, don'’t you? >> Excuse me. >> Would you by any chance be Mr. Thomas Gerrin? >> Would you mind showing me some I.D., sir? >> Okay, you got me. What can I do for you, officer? >> You are Mr. Thomas Gerrin. >> I haven'’t robbed a bank in ten or twelve years. >> We'’ve been asked to keep an eye out for you, sir. >> By who? >> We got a fax on you. As I understand, your folks are somewhat concerned as to your well-being. Have you talked to them lately? >> No, but I was just gonna call '’em. I'’m not breaking any laws, am I? >> No, sir, no, you'’re not. Not as far as I know. >> You gonna tell '’em you saw me? >> Well, I imagine they'’d appreciate hearing that you'’re okay and haven'’t fallen in harm'’s way, don'’t you? >> Yeah, well, if I go home, they'’re gonna lock me in that cellar again. >> He'’s kidding. >> Where you headed, sir? >> Home. Soon as I finish my coffee. >> Why don'’t you ring your folks and tell '’em that? >> I will, I'’ll do that. >> That'’s the ticket. Have a nice day now. >> Okay, thank you. >> Thank you. >> So are you? >> Huh? >> Are you heading home? >> I'’ve come too far to turn back now. >> Whereabouts you headed in California? >> Monterey. >> Well, I can take you as far as Stockton if you like. It'’s not too bad a hop from there to Monterey. >> Well, we'’d be much obliged, thank you. >> You related? >> Uh, no. No. >> I thought maybe you were her grandpappy. >> I wouldn'’t mind that, but no. We just met up on the road. >> If you don'’t mind me saying, you'’re kind of a peculiar pair to be hitchhiking. >> Are we? >> Daddy? >> What? It'’s all right. You all right, love? Everything'’s okay. You were probably just dreaming. It'’s okay, you all right? Okay, everything'’s okay. >> Where are we? >> Almost through Nevada. >> Oh, boy, California, here we come. >> ♪ Always together ♪ ♪ Through all kinds of weather ♪ ♪ We took the long way home ♪ >> He was lying to that cop. >> I guess. >> He'’d have been home by now, for sure. >> Could be on his way. >> Could be he'’ll never come back. >> Why wouldn'’t he come back? >> Well, why would he take off in the first place? >> I don'’t know. Maybe we shouldn'’t have made him sell the house. >> Maybe. Maybe he felt like he was getting in our way, living with us. >> Well, you know what I think. >> We'’re the ones that'’re taking care of him, not you. >> And you see how much he appreciates it, don'’t you? >> What do you want from him? >> Nothing, I don'’t want anything from him. >> What'’s your beef with him, anyway? What'’d he ever do to you? >> Nothing, not a damn thing. >> Pete, I know he'’s not perfect. I know better than anybody. >> Yeah, but you'’re still trying to prove something to him. Don'’t you know you can'’t get blood from a turnip? Why do you think Marcie and Janice moved so far away? >> They like the weather down there. >> After the funeral, after Mom died? I saw one of Janice'’s kids sitting on Dad'’s lap, and I started to cry. I had to leave the room. I never sat on Dad'’s lap. >> Which way you going? >> That way. >> Oh, well. I guess this is it. Leanne, I want you to know it'’s been a real pleasure. I guess there'’s a motel or two around here somewhere. >> Oh, don'’t be ridiculous. >> We'’re here. >> Huh? Oh. >> What a dump, huh? >> Yeah, I was hoping for something a little nicer. >> Are you sure this is okay? >> Mm-hmm. Hello? Anybody home? >> Hiya, beautiful. >> Hi, Daddy. This is Tom Gerrin. He'’s been traveling with me. My father, Craig Bossert. >> Hello. >> How do you do, sir? >> I'’ve invited him to stay. >> Good. >> The prodigal daughter. >> Hello, Mother. >> You arrived safely. >> The plane crashed, and I'’m the sole survivor. >> And who have we here? >> This is you. That'’s the john. Relax, it'’s only a bedroom. >> Uh-huh. >> Would you like something to drink? >> No, no thanks. >> You promised. >> I know. >> Bonnie? It'’s me. I'’m fine, I'’m in California. >> California? What the hell'’s he doing in California? >> He says he felt like having a swim in the ocean. I don'’t know who the girl is, he didn'’t say. He didn'’t-- He didn'’t say, okay. Pete. If we hear from him again, I'’ll call you. You think you know somebody. Come to find out, you don'’t know him at all. >> I'’d sure like to know why he took off. Was it us? >> All my life, all I ever wanted was to be close to him. Now that he'’s retired, I thought... >> People have different ways of being close. >> I guess. >> What brings you to California, Mr. Gerrin? Do you have family here? >> No, no ma'’am, no family. It just came on me to take a trip. >> Impulse. >> Impulse, yeah, that'’s it, yeah. >> It'’s a shame about the accident. It was a beautiful car. >> Tell you the truth, I really enjoyed the hitchhiking. Especially the company. >> Likewise. >> And how long will you be staying with us, Mr. Gerrin? >> As long as he likes. >> By all means. >> I'’m sure it'’ll be no trouble at all. >> I had to threaten him with bodily harm if he didn'’t come. He wanted to go to a motel. >> She can be persuasive. >> Oh, she can. Well, you know what the Arabs say. >> [chuckling] [knocking] >> Since when do you have to knock? >> How'’s it going? >> I like your traveling pal. >> He'’s a trip. >> A trip on a trip. But, ahem. Hitchhiking? >> "O, but I love the danger." >> I think Emily Dickinson had something else in mind other than hurling oneself into the voracious jaws of a lunatic America. Come back, Shane. >> He got a letter, too, Tom. >> Of a summoning nature, as well? >> I don'’t think so. I think he made it that, though. >> Interpretation is all. >> So? You still haven'’t answered my question. How are you doing, Daddy? >> How do I look like I'’m doing? >> A lot worse than I expected. >> Your Mother didn'’t give you the full rundown in her letter? I asked her to be specific. What'’s Daddy'’s 11th Commandment, class? >> Thou shalt not tap dance. >> Correct. >> I think she did some tap dancing. She said that the operation turned out "iffy," but she didn'’t give me a clue about this. >> I think "iffy" about says it all. >> Do me a favor, kick off your tap shoes, please. >> I'’ve got maybe three weeks. If I knock off the jogging. >> She should'’ve told me. Why didn'’t she tell me? >> If you'’d known, you'’d'’ve flown. Calm down. >> I considered opting for belated notification. >> And I never would'’ve forgiven you. >> I know. >> I think your visit may be a little longer than planned. A certain degree of pluck and fortitude will be asked of you, you understand? >> I'’ll try to measure up. >> You'’re aces with me, kid. >> Will it be all right with you if I started measuring up tomorrow? I love you so much, Daddy. >> Why didn'’t you tell me? >> Your father didn'’t want you to worry. >> You would'’ve let him die without seeing me. >> Don'’t be ridiculous. >> You didn'’t want me here. You wanted him all to yourself, right up into the end. You had to be in control. >> As usual, you see only what you want to see. I'’m going to bed. [door slams] >> Want to swim? >> Never learned how. >> Get out. >> No. I might flounder a bit if there'’s a lifeguard handy, but... >> My dad taught me when I was a baby. >> Yeah? You'’re fond of your Dad, aren'’t you? >> Yeah. >> But I... I take it you and your mom don'’t exactly see eye to eye. >> Maybe she did the best she knew how. >> I don'’t mean to pry, but he doesn'’t seem exactly up to par. Your dad? >> He'’s dying. >> I'’m sorry, sweetheart. He'’s such a young man. >> Life isn'’t fair, is it? >> He'’s working, though. >> He does some stuff in the morning and some at night. As a consultant now. >> Yeah, but I mean he'’s still at it, he'’s working. >> Why wouldn'’t he be? >> Well, a fella in his condition, physically, he might just want to call it a day. >> He won'’t go gently into the night. You know what I mean? >> I think so. >> So? You gonna look her up? >> Oh, I already did. >> You did? >> Yes, she'’s listed in the phone book. >> Well, are you going to call her first, or are you just gonna show up on her doorstep and blow her mind? >> See, I haven'’t decided. What do you think is the best way? >> You nervous? >> Oh, as cool as a cucumber. >> Liar. >> Pants on fire. >> 55 years, wow. God. You must'’ve been, like, what, in your 20'’s? >> Yeah, 21, 22. I'’m surprised she still remembered me. >> Were you her first lover? Oh, lighten up. >> Yes. >> How old was she? >> 19. >> Really. That'’s late. I lost my virginity when I was 15. Why do we say that? "Lose our virginity." Like we left it on the bus or something. >> Well, I got you this far. Now, you'’re on your own. What'’s the worst that can happen? She dies of shock. >> Okay, okay, I'’m going. >> Now, you call me when you'’re ready, and I'’ll pick you up, okay? >> Yeah. It'’s not what you think, hon. I don'’t know what it is, but it is not what you think. >> Hello. Oh, my stars. >> Hi, Ronnie. It'’s Tom. >> Tom. >> Yeah, Gerrin. Tom Gerrin. >> Well, I guess I knew that, didn'’t I? >> You still take lots of sugar? >> Too much, so they tell me. >> If we listened to "they", we'’d be dead and buried already. >> You could'’ve knocked me over with a feather, Ronnie, I guess you know that, huh? When your letter came. >> What about you ringing my doorbell? What on Earth are you doing here? >> Well, I don'’t know, I was just taking a little walk, and one thing led to another. >> You'’re not gonna start teasing me again already, are you? >> No, no, I really mean it. I bumped into this young girl. >> You ran somebody over? >> No, hell, I wasn'’t driving. I was walking. I mean I met her, on the road. And it turns out she was, eh, coming to Carmel. So we started talking. And-- thank you. She lives here, her folks. College girl. So we got to talking, you know, one thing lead to another. Before I knew it, I was going with her. We thumbed it. >> You'’re not telling me you hitched rides all the way from Kansas, are you? >> So help me God. >> What'’s Beaumont like now? >> The same. Only different. This town sure is pretty. How long you been here? >> 36 years. >> Oh. >> 24 in this house. >> Wow. >> It'’s a lovely family. >> Yeah. Three girls and one boy. >> The girls are all married now and scattered around. Seven grandkids. >> Wow. >> My boy was killed in Vietnam. >> Oh, God, I'’m-- I'’m sorry to hear that, Ronnie. >> Oh, seems so long ago. Most things do, don'’t they? >> Yeah. You told me about Charlie'’s passing in your letter. >> Eight years ago. Have you seen the ocean yet? >> And what about Jack, how'’s he? >> Oh, Jack was killed in the war in France. >> Oh, what a shame. >> Yeah. >> I was real fond of Jack. >> So there'’s only me left of the bunch of us. We went to visit his grave, though, on the anniversary of the Invasion. You know, '’94, the 50th anniversary. >> I guess you were in the war, too. >> Oh, yeah, sure. >> Charlie was hurt real bad. At Iwo Jima. >> Hmm. >> Lost an arm. His left arm. He used to say he was my right hand man. >> [laughing] You ever miss home? >> For a while, after we left. Charlie did, more than me. >> Seems like yesterday right now. >> What does? >> The day I heard that you and Charlie got married and left Beaumont. Why did you, anyway? Leave Beaumont? >> I wouldn'’t have been too comfortable there after we got married, you being there. >> I wouldn'’t have been too comfortable myself. >> I'’m still trying to place Donna Wallace. >> I think she was two grades behind you. >> I used to wonder why you didn'’t want to marry me. >> Well, who says I didn'’t want to marry you? >> You never asked. >> Well... >> Why didn'’t you ever ask then? >> I didn'’t think you wanted me to. I thought about it a lot. >> Being married to me? >> Oh, yeah. >> You should'’ve asked. >> Boy, those were the best pork chops I have had in a long time. >> I'’m glad I had '’em. If I knew you were coming, I'’d have baked a cake. Remember that song? >> Oh, sure. ♪ If I knew you were comin'’ ♪ ♪ I'’d have baked a cake ♪ ♪ Baked a cake, baked a cake ♪ >> You can still sing. >> Yeah, well, the pipes are a little rusty. Like everything else. >> Listen to you. A man who just walked half way across the country. >> Oh, hey, you'’re exaggerating. There was a little walking, but not all the way. >> How long are you planning on staying in Monterey? >> Well, I guess I'’d better be heading back tomorrow. >> Oh, that'’s when Betsy was just born. That'’s her. [both laughing] I put on lots of weight with Betsy. >> You seem to have lost it all. Charlie sure kept his looks, didn'’t he? >> He was a handsome man, I'’ll give him that. You have a picture of Donna? >> Yeah, sure. >> Nope, I can'’t place her. I... I heard about her passing away a couple years ago, but I didn'’t think I should write you, so soon after. Then it took me a while before I could work up the nerve. >> I'’m glad you did. [doorbell] >> Be right with you. >> Mm-hmm. >> Well, I don'’t expect we'’ll be seeing each other again ever. >> Well, today was more than I ever expected. >> Me too. >> And you never can tell, can you? >> About what? >> Well, you might just get it into your mind to pay a visit to Beaumont. I could show you the new sights. >> You never can tell. >> Maybe you'’ll think about it. >> I'’ve been thinking about it for the past two hours. >> What do you mean? >> Fact is, I'’m going to visit one of my daughters and her family in Pennsylvania in April. >> Are you? >> And I'’ve been thinking how it would be if I just dropped by Beaumont on the way back. >> Oh, I think that'’s a darn good idea. [both laughing] >> Why don'’t I just do that then? >> Okay, will you? >> I'’ll write. Let you know when I'’ll be coming. >> Good. >> Safe home.

Fixing how? >> Well, things like Bonnie always wrapping me up in blankets all the time. >> Listen, Dad, I know we-- >> You know that little shed you'’ve got out back that'’s crammed full of junk you never use? >> What about it? >> That would make a fine workshop. >> A workshop? For what? >> We'’ll have a talk. There'’s a lot of things I want to tell you. You and Pete both. Give my love to Bonnie, hmm? I'’ll see you in a couple nights. >> Dad...
