(boys whispering) (chain clicking) - Where did you get it? - [Helmuth] Shh. (man on radio speaking German) (radio stations playing) (drum beating) - [Broadcaster] This is BBC London. Here is the German news broadcast, 10th of August, 1941. As of 10 o'clock, 175 German aircraft have been destroyed in today's raids over this country. The British ship Ark Royal was involved in battle with German fighters. But despite the heavy firing the Ark Royal remains unharmed. - [Oma] Helmuth, Rudi, is that you up there? - Yes, Oma, it's just us. - [Oma] It's late, Rudi, you run along home before your mother starts to worry. - Yes, ma'am. - Tomorrow night, 10 o'clock. Remember, it's a secret. (chain clicking) (radio frequencies whirring) (melancholy flute music) (man speaking German on radio) ♫ Be still my soul ♫ The Lord is on thy side ♫ Bear patiently thy cross ♫ Of grief or pain - Thinking of Papa again. (speaking German) - You were certainly out late last night. I was beginning to worry. - I was just at Helmuth's. - Exactly. (ominous music) Rudi? Rudi? - It says here that a British aircraft carrier named the Ark Royal has been sunk. - What is it? - The Ark Royal didn't sink, it's still afloat. - And just how do you know that? Have you seen it yourself or did you have a dream? - I'm not kidding, Mutti. The Ark Royal didn't sink. The newspaper is printing lies. This is the second time that the German news has claimed to have sunk it. Helmuth said that when-- - Helmuth said. And how does he know? - He heard it somewhere. - Whatever Helmuth says, you believe. But no one can know for sure, we're at war. Everybody lies. - But how do we know that everything we've been told hasn't been a lie? - [Mutti] How do we know that it is? - What if German isn't winning the war like we've been told? - Slow down, slow down, you don't know any of this for certain. - Father told me not to get mixed up with the Nazis. You know the terrible things they've done to our Jewish friends. Remember Dr. Levinburk? Why would stop short of lying about it? - Fine, let's say Helmuth is right. The Nazi government has been lying to us. What then? - We can't just sit here and take that. We've got to fight back. - An eye for eye and a tooth for a tooth? - So you're saying we should do nothing? That I should sit here and do nothing while Hitler and the Nazis beat and kill and lie to us about it? - No, I am not. But there are better ways to fight. - Like what? - The best way to fight cruelty and dishonesty is with compassion and truth. - I just wish-- - Promise me you'll remember what I said and above all, that you won't do anything dangerous. (clock chimes) - I don't want to be late. (sighs) I'm going to Helmuth's tonight so I won't be here when you get home from work. - Rudi! - Don't worry, I'll be careful. Tschuss, Mutti. (Big Band '40s music) (knocking) - You didn't say anything to anyone, did you? - No, of course not. My mother still doesn't trust you, though. - What, why? - The Lord Lister Detective Agency. - (laughs) Well, that was five years ago. - I know. - [Helmuth] Is she ever going to let me forget it? - Maybe, when you're 50. (thudding) - Whoa, afraid I'm going to lead you into more danger, is that it? (both laughing) - Something like that. - The only thing dangerous about listening to the radio is getting caught doing it. And that wouldn't happen to two such clever detectives as us. Besides, I only listen late at night when Oma and Opa are in bed, anyway. - Even if they did catch you it's not like they would report their own grandson to the Gestapo. I still can't believe your brother left a short wave radio to use. - As a matter of fact, he hid it in the closet and made me promise not to touch it until his next leave. (laughing) - That sounds more like Gerhard. I have missed listening to those great American songs, though. ♫ Moonlight and roses ♫ Bring wonderful memories of you - Guten abend, Herr Professor. Sorry to interrupt your little concert, there. - [Helmuth] Karl, come in. - What's he doing here? - [Helmuth] Oh, he's in on the secret I'm going to share with you. - I'm Helmuth's friend, too. - See I just, I don't usually socialize with kids. - You're only two years older than me. - Well, there's a big difference between 15 and 17. - Helmuth's only 16. - And there's a difference between 15 and 16. By the time you're Helmuth's age you'll be yet another case of innocent childhood lost to the harsh realities of the adult world, so enjoy it now, kid. (smacks) Ooh, (laughs) now the kid's angry. - Alright you two, I didn't bring you here to fight. - What did you bring me here for anyway, Herr Professor? Oh, so this is the radio you were telling me about. What have been listening to, you get any good dance music on it? You two look as those you're about to explode. - It's not just any radio. It has short wave. - Short wave? How far can you hear? - Far enough. - It's almost time, Helmuth. - We want you to listen to our favorite program. (radio crackling) (drum beating) - [Broadcaster] This is BBC London. Here is the German news broadcast. - The British Broadcasting Corporation! Are you two crazy? - Shh! - What's the matter, Karl? You aren't scared are you? - Listening to dance music illegally is one thing, but listening to enemy broadcasts is treason. - The British are not our enemies. - Look, Herr Professor, I think this Allied propaganda's going to your head because last time I checked the British were dropping bombs on us. - No, no, no we are being lied to and the British are trying to bring us the truth. - You mean the British are the ones lying to us. - No, Karl, Helmuth's right. Hitler's been lying to us about the war and how well it's going. - And every night at 10 o'clock the BBC broadcasts a special news report for the German people telling us the truth about the war. - How can you know it's the truth? - They're the ones with all the facts. - What facts? - Whenever the German news reports a battle it is always glorious victory for Germany and total defeat for everyone else. The BBC gives numbers, casualties, admits setbacks and defeats for their own side as well as ours. - Tell him about the Ark Royal. - What's the Ark Royal? - Oh, just a British aircraft carrier that the German news claims to have sunk, twice. - Twice? - See? Even you should know you can't sink a ship twice. - Look, listen, if Hitler was telling the truth, why would government control information so tightly? They destroy or make illegal any information they can't control. Why would they do this if they weren't lying to us? Look, listen for yourself, you'll see. - Come on, Karl. What's the big deal? I thought you hated the Nazis? - I don't like the Nazis, of course, but I'm not willing to risk my neck to listen to enemy broadcasts. - They're Hitler's enemies. - I understand that, alright? - Don't you want to know the truth? - Of course I want to know the truth, it's just... I just, alright, count me in. Only because I can't have you two feeling superior because you know more than me. But listen, you better keep your mouth shut about this, kid. I don't want to get arrested. - One of the enemy's greatest tools is making you believe you are the only one who opposes them. But we tell you that you are not the only one. There are immense numbers of people who feel as you do. Reach out to one another and find strength in the knowledge that you are not alone. You must have a rallying emblem to help you. The V for victory is the symbol of the unconquerable will of the people, a sign of our solidarity. Multiply this symbol around you. Use it as a greeting, tap it out in Morse code. (drum beating) Whistle the tune of it, let the enemy see it written everywhere and understand that we who oppose him are not few in number, but are legion. Victory! (triumphant music) (scraping) - Oh well, who do we have this time? Rudi, Helmuth and Karl, is it? Do you think we can postpone church services just because you three couldn't get here in time? - Sorry, Heinrich, we were just busy enjoying God's creations along the way. - Getting into trouble is more like it. Now, help me set up the chapel before everyone else arrives. - Yes, sir. - Wait a minute. Are we forgetting something? Almighty God, grant us thy spirit on this Sabbath day as we seek to do thy work. Reach forth thy hand to prevent our victory in this unholy war. Bring swift destruction to the Nazi government and make us free. In the name of our savior we ask these things, amen. - Herr Worbst, you could be arrested for talking like that. - So I should go along everything Hitler says just to keep myself safe? - Well, there's nothing wrong with keeping yourself safe. - The Lord tells us to be truthful and to resist evil. If I'm doing what he asks, he will protect me. - That doesn't give you the right to be reckless with your life. God also gave you brains and expects you to make smart decisions. - You, Helmuth, are too impertinent for your own good. - Sorry, I, I mean to say that yes, God wants us to stand up for what is right, but I think he expects us to think out the best way to go about it. - Like what, Helmuth? - I don't know yet. - [Herr Muller] Guten tag, boys. - Hello, Chief. - You must be our volunteers for this week. Thank you for your fine service. - Oh, it's no trouble, Herr Muller. - Well Helmuth I meant to ask you, have you had a chance to finish those last batch of letters to our soldiers yet? - Not quite yet, I'm having a hard time getting over to use the typewriter because, actually, uh... Do you think I could bring the typewriter to my house? So I can finish the letters easier, I mean. - I don't see why not. You're a trustworthy secretary. As long as we know where it is. - Danke. I'll bring it with me after services today. - Excellent. Keep up the good work. We must do everything we can to support our soldiers who are fighting to return Germany to its rightful place in the sun. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler? - [Karl] You knew he was a party member. - Yes, but he usually keeps it separate from church. - Well, the party doesn't condemn Christianity. - They don't openly condemn it, but they're opposed to anything or anyone they see as competing for loyalty with the Fuhrer and the party. - So why can't you just do both? - What is the first commandment of every National Socialist? - What? - Come on, the ABC's of National Socialism. What is the first one? - Love Germany more than anything. - And what is the first commandment of God? - Thou shalt have no other gods before me. - You cannot have faith in Hitler's eternal Germany and faith in the eternal kingdom of God. - But, Herr Muller is a Nazi and he believes in God. And he wouldn't hurt anyone. - I agree, he's one of the kindest people I know. - So it's possible to do both. - Well, no, he's managing to reconcile the two so far, but once there's a conflict between them, where will his loyalties lie? - Enough philosophical debate for one day, Herr Professor. - Why don't you and Rudi come on over to my place again tonight? - Sure, Helmuth. - Alright, you're going the need the extra muscle to carry that typewriter home, anyway. (chuckles) (crowd chattering) - Heinrich. - What is it, Rudi? - You said that if you're doing what is right God will protect you. Are you sure? - The evil influence of the party is spreading everywhere. We must resist evil and help spread the truth, no matter the cost. - It's just that my mother doesn't want me to do anything dan-- - Let us begin with our opening hymn. - Listen Rudi, if you see your neighbor's house on fire you warn them. You don't worry about your own safety and you don't knock politely on the door. I will keep speaking out against the Nazis because I am speaking the truth. And anyone who knows the truth has an obligation to do the same. (dramatic music) (all laughing) - Helmuth, why did you have to open your big mouth and volunteer to take this typewriter home? - Well, thought it might be useful. - Useful for what? - I do have a lot of church work to do with it. - How much church work-- ♫ Moonlight and roses ♫ Bring wonderful memories of you ♫ My heart reposes ♫ In beautiful - [Youth] Let's see your identification cards. (snapping) - Are you all members of the Hitler Youth? - Yes, of course. - A little more respect from you, if you please. Let's hear you recite the Oath of Allegiance. (slapping) Now, dummkopf! - I promise to do my duty-- - Come on, all of you! - [Helmuth And Karl] In love and loyalty to the Fuhrer and our flag. - Are you part of the HJ, too, or are you just dumb? - I'm not a member. - He can talk. I guess he was just scared. - Take that back. I'm not afraid of anything. - Take it easy, kid. This isn't a place to pick fights. - Report to your local Hitler Youth office this week. - We'll see if you're scared then. - Why should I go? - For the honor of joining up, of course. Now get off the streets, before I report you. - But next time we hear your sorry voices screeching, it better be a song of the Fatherland! - Report us? We haven't done anything wrong. The leaders of this country preach comradeship with one hand and threaten and bully with the other. All the while saying we should be grateful for the honor? People must see through these lies. Of course the propaganda department will put another fresh piece of paper in their typewriter and a new game will begin. - Helmuth. (whistling) - What's that-- - Let's forget those Nazi slaves. - Yes, let's sing. - How about a song for the Fatherland? ♫ Moonlight and roses ♫ Bring wonderful memories of you ♫ My heart reposes (drum beating) - Even if actual successes for the German army are lacking such are being officially fabricated so that the German people do not realize that everything that glitters is not gold. Resist the allure of false hope. Just because Hitler promises you financial and military success does not mean he has the power to bring it about. Hitler entices you to follow him by holding out the golden promises of prosperity and power for you and your country. But he blinds you so you will not see that the price for this promised greatness is your freedom. (clock ticking) - Rudolph Wobbe. It has been two years since you've been old enough to join the Hitler Youth and yet we have seen nothing of you. - I've been very busy. - What would keep you so busy that you are not able to attend one single meeting? - I work during the days and go to school in the evenings. - And on weekends? - I'm busy with my church. (officer sighs) - Seems to me that you are trying to get out of joining the Hitler Youth. Why would that be? Don't you like target shooting, camping trips, sporting competitions? I already know that you like singing. Is that not right? - Yes. - I see you like to get in fights. We could teach you to fight properly. What would be more important than that? - I'm trying to bring glory to Germany by improving my mind. (laughs) - Well spoken, Rudolph. But I'm sure the Fuhrer would not want you to miss out on the wonderful opportunities the Hitler Youth provides. Take it, I'll fill out the necessary paperwork later. Welcome to the Hitler Youth. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. - Hey, kid. - I'm in a hurry. - Not so tough now without your friends, are you? - Tough enough to take you. (laughs) - And I thought you were just a church clown who loves to dance in the streets singing love songs. - Watch it. - Or what? What can you do to me? - Why don't you find out, you coward? - You better say your prayers now, boy. You're going to need the help. - I don't need help to take you. (punching) (lively band music) I tell ya, it's true, one punch and down he went. I was so mad, I wasn't going to let him push me again. - He must have been pretty small for you to knock him down. - You're just jealous because I'm the one getting all the action. - The action? - Defending the truth, like Heinrich said. - Rudi, you punched one person. What good does that do? Nothing. Why didn't you just join the Hitler Youth, anyway? - I did once. - What happened? - I'd rather not talk about it, if it's all the same to you. - Well, it's not all the same to me. - Helmuth, where have you been? It's almost time. - Herr Professor, you don't look so good. - Heinrich Worbst has been arrested by the Gestapo. - What? - [Karl] When, what happened? - Today, I don't know all the circumstances but he was out on the street, he said something bad about the Nazis and someone reported him, he was picked up immediately. - I warned him to be careful. - He was doing the right thing, Karl. - And it'll do about as much good as you punching people. - At least I'm doing something. - What has this country come to? We're not even allowed to have opinions anymore. If the party is so great and benevolent why are they so frightened of free thinking? - They must be really scared if they're punishing people like Heinrich Worbst. He doesn't like Nazis, that's for sure, but his talk is completely harmless. - It's not idle talk they're afraid of. What they fear more than anything is the German people learning the truth because then we could band together and defeat them. - Well, we have the truth and we can't change anything. - Well that's exactly what they want you to think. - Then let's do something. - Like what, go around punching all the Nazis we see in the nose? - Karl, leave it alone, you sound like my mother. - Well, maybe you should listen to one of us. - Fine. You're both right, no more fights. But if we want to make a real difference we have to get organized, have a plan. - Get organized, a plan? - If the truth is what the Nazis are most afraid of then let's spread it. - And how do you propose we do that? We can't exactly invite all the people of Germany up into Helmuth's attic to listen to the radio. - But we can bring the radio broadcasts to the people. - What? - We can bring the radio broadcasts to the people. - You already have a plan. I knew it. - What plan? - [Rudi] Hitler the Murderer? - Where did you get this? - I told you two that typewriter would come in handy. (whistling) - The broadcasts. Helmuth, how did you? - I listened to the radio, I took notes in shorthand and I typed it up. I typed that message verbatim, but I have another one I wrote myself. - How did you get it stamped with the Nazi seal? - Well there are certain advantages to apprenticing in the social services department. You can thank them for the red paper, too. Effective, isn't it? - This is a chain letter, pass it on? - Oh, I read that in a book. If you say that, then people will pass it from person to person so it will reach many more people than we could by ourselves. - How many do you have? - A hundred. - A hundred? - I used carbon paper so I only had to type it up 20 times. - What are you planning to do with all those? - We'll put them in telephone booths, mailboxes, apartment houses, anywhere we can get them. - We? - Yes, me, you and Rudi. - The three Musketeers. - I won't be a part of it. - Don't you want to fight for freedom? Be a part of our brotherhood? - Our what? - We want to be a brotherhood united to never part despite danger or want. We want to be free as our fathers were and rather have death than to live in slavery. We put our trust in the almighty God and are not afraid of the tyranny of man. - Hauptmann? - Schiller, William Tell, Act 2, Scene 2. - You and your banned books and dramatic speeches. Not this time, Helmuth. - [Rudi] What's the matter, Karl, scared again? - You see, that's just it, isn't it? What you said just now about being afraid of the tyranny of man. I am afraid. Alright, I'm terrified, and you should be, too. - Then you're right Karl, it's not a game. - You bet it's not a game and it's not one of your silly plays, either. Did you see what they did to Heinrich? He says one small thing about the government, now he's locked up. And you expect me to help print and distribute hundreds of flyers who say Hitler the Murderer? - Heinrich wasn't careful. Look, if we handle it right it will work. I've thought it all out, trust me. - I don't know. - Listen, Karl, you know what brutality the Nazis are capable of. Don't you? We have to do something about it. - And what good can three teenagers do? - We can warn the people. Bring them to the point of asking questions and saying, wait a minute something's not right. I want to learn the truth myself. And once enough people know the truth, who knows what can happen? - Rudi Wobbe, hero of the resistance. - Karl? - Can I think about it first? - Sure Karl, go home and think about it all you want. But, can you distribute these along the way? Remember, telephone booths, mailboxes, wherever you can. - Aye aye. - And Rudi, don't get caught. (laughs) (tender music) Should the threatening storm all wellness, I have but done what I could not refuse. (typewriter clicking) (keys pinging) - It's been over a month now since the press and the radio in Germany grandly announced the results of the wool collection program, over 70 million articles. But where are the 70 million articles? The soldiers on the front haven't received them. They do not write about them but only that they are freezing, freezing and freezing some more vainly waiting for some warm winter clothing. (typewriter dinging) - German youths, are you actually aware of what the Hitler Youth is and what goals it pursues? A compulsory organization of the first order for the recruiting of Nazi-enslaved national comrades. Hitler and his accomplices know that they must deprive you of your free will in order to make submissive, spineless creatures out of you. For Hitler knows that his contemporaries are beginning gradually to see through him, the murderer of millions. (typewriter dinging) - Nazi propaganda is good, it is very good. But it is still not good enough to make gleaming, never-before-seen kinds of victories out of miserable defeats and costly retreats. Out of lost battles and hopeless confusion without anyone noticing that something is wrong. Hitler's New Year's proclamation reveals all this in perfect clarity. The year 1942 will decide and this decision is reserved for the German people, long held in darkness, to make. (typewriter dinging) - Soldiers on the home front. Soldiers on all fronts, the Fuhrer has promised that this year will be decisive and that he will stop at nothing to keep his promise. He will send you by the thousands into the fire to finish the crime that he started. - Therefore, we are calling out to you. Do not let your free will, the most valuable thing you posses, be taken away. Do not let yourself be suppressed and tyrannized. - Germans, arise, a determined deed can still rescue you and your country from the abyss to which Hitler has led you with his sweet talk. By the thousands, wives and children will become widows and orphans. - Turn your back on the Hitler Youth, the tool of the Hitler regime for your destruction. - Make your decision before it is too late and throw off this unspeakable burden! - How much will you tolerate? - How long will you wait? - Germany, awake! (dramatic music) (speaking German) (clock chiming) - Another late night? - Yes, Mutti. - [Mutti] With Helmuth, again? - [Rudi] And Karl. - What do you three do? - Just talk and listen. Listen to records. - [Mutti] What records? - Just some of Gerhard's old dance records. (humming) - (laughs) Rudi, since when have you been interested in dancing? - I have to impress the girls somehow. - I don't think you'll need dancing to impress the girls. - [Rudi] You're my mother, you have to say things like that. - No, I don't have to. You're growing up so fast, Rudi. Sometimes I feel like I hardly know you anymore. And then all of a sudden I catch a glimpse of my young Rudikin again. Your Papa would be so proud of you. - Mutti. I want to tell you. - [Mutti] Yes? - I, I, I love you. - I love you, too. I don't know what I'd do without you (speaking German). But Rudi, you haven't been going to Helmuth's to practice dancing. - No. - What have you been doing, then? - Just talking, Mutti. - That's a lot of talking. What do you three talk about? - Life, politics, the future. - So serious? - You see, we're growing up. No more mischief. - Do you give me your word on that? - What? - Promise me. - I promise. - [Mutti] Thank you, Rudi. - I should get going. - Oh, just a moment. You received another summons from the Hitler Youth yesterday. They want you to attend the meetings. - Yes? - Are you going to? - They can force me to join, but they can't make me go. - At least think about it. You used to love sports and hiking. - Mutti. - Now all you do is sit around with Helmuth and talk. You know it might be nice to make some new friends. - No. - And it would be safer if you went. - No, Mutti! I can't do it. It's nothing but a training ground for the next wave of Nazi slaves and I won't be a part of it! - Does this have anything to do with that camp out? I'm sure things would be different this time. - Please, please don't make me do this. - Rudi you know I won't force you. I, I just want you to be careful and I-- - I know, I know! That's all you ever say to me anymore. - Rudi, Heinrich Worbst has been released from prison. - I have to go see him. - He's, he's not the same. - What do you mean? - Whatever they did to him, must have been terrible. - I have to tell Helmuth. You see? What they did to Heinrich? That is why we have to do something! - But that is also why we need to be careful. - I'm going to be out late again. Don't wait up. Tschuss, Mutti. - Be careful, Rudikin. (dramatic music) - Herr Worbst? Heinrich, it's Helmuth and Karl and Rudi. - Boys, why are you here? - We came to get you. Do you think we can postpone church services just because you can't get there in time? - I thought you would stay away like everyone else. - What do you mean? - Hasn't anyone come to see you? - No. They're all too scared. I cannot blame them. Every, every night I dream they're here to arrest me and take me back. (crying) - What happened? - They made me sign a paper that said I had been treated well. They told me if I ever said anything different they would, they would find me and send me back. (sobbing) - What should we do? - I don't know. - Maybe we should go. - Well we can't just leave him here like this. - [Karl] I don't think he even knows we're sill here. ♫ Be still my soul ♫ The Lord is on thy side ♫ Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain ♫ Leave to thy God to order and provide ♫ In every change he faithful will remain ♫ Be still, my soul ♫ Thy best, thy heavenly Friend ♫ Through thorny ways ♫ Leads to a joyful end - It was cold. So very cold. They forced us to stand outside naked. Knee deep in the snow. Our hands were shackled together in front. And stretched out on a block the water was dripped on our hands. All night it would drip, drip and freeze there. Then they would beat on our frozen hands until the ice was loose and our fingers were broken. (Heinrich sobbing) They called it a re-education process. - That must have been some education. - My place, 10 o'clock. - Tonight? - [Helmuth] As often as we can until this ends. (pensive music) (drum beating) - In modern war the enemy fights not only with military weapons, but also with the means to influence the people mentally and spiritually and break down their resistance. The Nazi regime seeks to maintain strict control over the information you receive so they alone can influence your thoughts and feelings. If the German people are to break free of this tyranny they must first break free of the lies. Those of you listening to this broadcast, tell your friends and neighbors to tune in to the re-broadcast of this program tomorrow at 12 noon. The truth must be spread. - Hitler's the guilty one. - They're really going to love this one, Helmuth. - I just wish I could see the look on their Nazi faces when they read this. - Do you think they've seen any? - Maybe no one's turned one in yet. - Unless someone's been taking them down, they've seen them. - What do you mean? - You know the bulletin boards outside the apartment buildings? - The Nazi bulletin boards, for official party notices. - I've been tacking leaflets to them. (all laughing) - I've got to hand it to you, you're one gutsy kid. Maybe I've misjudged you this whole time. Like at, at Heinrich's today. You knew exactly what to do. - What made you think of singing Rudi? - We sang that song at my father's funeral. My mother always sings it when I... I just thought it might help Heinrich, too. - Good, old Rudi. - You're alright, kid. - Does that mean you'll stop calling me 'kid'? (sighs) - Nope. (scuffling) Oh. (smacking) - Hey, you better keep it quiet, you'll wake up my grandparents. - Sure thing, Helmuth, just as soon as I teach this kid how to respect his elders. - [Rudi] You mean as soon as I teach this old man what youth can do. (both laughing) - Quiet. - [Gestapo Agent] Larssenstrasse 42, this is the place. (ominous music) (shuffling papers) (knocking) - [Gestapo Agent] Open up! Gestapo! Frau Lingen! - [Mrs. Lingen] What is it? - Neighbors. - [Gestapo Agent] Where's your husband? - [Mrs. Lingen] He's, he's not here. - [Gestapo Agent] We'll check for ourselves. Out of our way! (banging and glass shattering) - [Mrs. Lingen] What has he done? Tell me, what has he done? - [Gestapo Agent] Here he is. - [Mr. Lingen] I'll be back. Greta, there has to be a mistake. (woman crying) - [Gestapo Agent] Shut your mouth! (slapping) (woman crying) (engine roaring) - Every night someone else disappears. And for a minute, I thought it was going to be us. - They couldn't really be looking for us though, right? How would they even know that we're involved? - If we continue to be careful, they shouldn't know. - In the stories, it's always one member of the gang that slips up first and gets caught, or gets tricked by a beautiful spy and rats out the others to save his own life. (Karl laughing) - [Karl] You've been reading too many spy novels, kid. - I don't know we need to worry about being seduced by a beautiful spy, Rudi. - I know, I just mean that it's usually just one person that gets caught. - So? - Rudi's right. We should make a pact that if we're caught, we will not, as Rudi's spy novels most eloquently put it, rat on the others. - I thought we weren't going to get caught. - Well, it's just a precaution. In case those beautiful spies do get to us after all. - Well, what should we say, Helmuth? - Do each of you make this vow of your own free will and choice? Very well, then. (clears throat) I, Helmuth Hubener. - I, Rudolph Wobbe. - I, Karl-Heinz Schnibbe. - Do hereby make a solemn vow. - [Karl And Rudi] Do hereby make a solemn vow. - That if I am caught, I will take the blame upon myself and not incriminate the others. - [Karl And Rudi] That if I am caught, I will take the blame upon myself and not incriminate the others. - [Helmuth] No matter what method of questioning. - Or torture. - And even in the face of torture. - [Karl And Rudi] No matter what method of questioning and even in the face of torture. - There, that should do it. - It feels so official now. Like we're a real resistance group. - A brotherhood, united, to never part despite danger or want. - Sure, but I don't know if I can trust this kid to keep his mouth shut under torture. - Worry about yourself, I can handle anything. - [Karl] No, you should have seen your face about one minute ago. - [Rudi] You weren't exactly calm, either. - Do you know that most of the prisoners of war here are French? - What? - Thousands of them in this military district alone. St. Barstow, Rubec, Etoulle. - You've lost me this time, Herr Professor. - Well, our first act as a now official resistance group is to translate the flyers into French and distribute them to the prisoners of war. - Mensch. - But Helmuth, none of us speak French. - Werner Kranz does. - [Rudi] Werner Kranz? - A boy I work with, I'm going to show him a flyer as soon as I get the chance. - That's-- - Those men are losing faith, Karl, thanks to Hitler's propaganda. And we can bring them the truth. Give them cause to hope again. - I don't know. Do you really think we should involve someone else? - Well Werner doesn't like Hitler any more than we do. - And you can really trust him? - Have I been wrong yet? - I just don't think it's a good idea. - Let's put it to a vote, then. I vote yes. Karl votes? - No. - Rudi, what do you think? - I think it's a great idea, Helmuth. - Oh, of course you do. - That settles it, then. Hopefully, I'll have the first French flyer by the end of the week. I'll also have another flyer for you to distribute as well. This is just the beginning. - It's getting late, I think I should go. - Me too. I hate lying to my mother about what we're doing. That's the only part of this I don't like. - Well, you have to. It's the only way to keep her safe. - I know, I won't say anything. - Besides, by lying to a few people we can bring the truth to many more. - Tschuss, Helmuth. - [Helmuth] See you Sunday. - Oh, and Helmuth, don't get caught. (laughing) - Um, Karl? - Yes? - You don't have to keep doing this, you know. - I know. Be careful, Helmuth. - Don't worry, everything will be fine. - Of course it will. (speaking German) (chuckles) (somber music) (crowd chattering) - Where's Helmuth? - I haven't seen him. - Do you think he slept in? - Have you ever known Helmuth to sleep in? - (laughs) You're right, he's probably just sick. - Before our worship service begins I have a special announcement to make. I regret to inform you that Helmuth Hubener, (ominous music) Helmuth Hubener was arrested by the Gestapo three days ago. (crowd chattering) - [Woman] That's impossible, what happened? - I don't know any information other than that it was for political reasons. When we have more information we will update you. That is all. (crowd chattering) - [Rudi] Karl, wait! - Get away from me, Rudi! Do you want people to suspect us, too? - But Karl, what do we do? - What can we do? - We could run away. We could go to Switzerland. - No, we can't do that. What would they do to our families if we suddenly disappeared? - So you think we just sit and wait? - We don't draw attention to ourselves. We pretend we're just as surprised as everyone else. - But Karl, we have to do something! - We don't do anything! You and I never spent time together without Helmuth and people would be suspicious if we started now. If we have to we'll talk at church again. - But, Karl! - What? - Will Helmuth be able to withstand torture? - I don't know, I don't know. I expect it won't be long until we find out. - Karl what are they going to do to him? - Stop it, do you want to drive yourself crazy? - Karl, what do I do if they question me? - Tell them that you burned the leaflets. Tell them that you know you made an honest mistake. Tell them anything but the truth. - Karl. - No, no, no contact. I have to go, if, if Helmuth, if Helmuth, if all goes well I'll see you next Sunday. - But, Karl, I just-- - No, no, next Sunday! (tragic music) - Dear God in heaven, please help Helmuth to withstand torture. Please, oh please, help him not to turn me in. (speaking German) Please, help me be safe. (drum beating) - The Reich is weakening and they know it. They are feeling the effects of your resistance and the disillusionment of the people. They are desperate to regain control of the German loyalty. Consequently, they will try harder than ever to suppress anything that looks like dissent or criticism by instilling you with fear. (speaking German) - How are you feeling this morning? - A little better. - You still look sick. - I just didn't sleep well last night. - You've hardly been sleeping or eating all week. Are you sure it's just an upset stomach? - Yes, I'll be fine soon. Any, any news about Helmuth? - No. Maybe we'll find out something more at church tomorrow. - Maybe. - What is it? You know if you were in trouble you can always come to me and tell me anything. - I think I just must still feel a little sick. I don't think I'll eat breakfast this morning after all. I'm sorry. - I know you are worried. About Helmuth. - [Rudi] Yes. - Are you sure you don't know what happened? - Yes! - But you said you and Helmuth had been talking. Maybe he'd been talking to others as well. - No, just Karl and I, and he wouldn't report him, either. - Maybe someone at work? - I don't know, Mutti! I told you I don't know! I wish I did. - If you don't know anything about it then I am sure that it is nothing. We might even see him at church tomorrow. - Yes. Everything will be better tomorrow. (somber music) - Good people of Germany we are fighting on your behalf, but you must resist. Resist the lies. You must not give in. Your fear and despair is the enemy's greatest weapon. (crying) (organ music) - Have you seen Karl-Heinz? - Yes, he's, oh no, wait. I see his family but he's not with them. Rudi, are you feeling well? - Before we begin our meeting I have another distressing announcement to make. It deeply saddens me that a second member of our congregation was arrested this week. Karl-Heinz Schnibbe was arrested by the Gestapo on charges of treason. Apparently, he was working in connection with Helmuth Hubener. - They've broken the law, we'll all be under suspicion. - [Man] Who else is involved? - [Woman] Those poor boys, what's going to happen to them? - They should be shot. (people gasping) With all the other traitors! - He must be one of them. (crowd chattering) (coughing) - Help me. Please, dear God, help me! Please don't let them find me. Please keep me safe, please, please! (dramatic music) (crying) - Rudi. - I'm sorry! I'm sorry I lied. I just wanted to protect you. - Is it bad? - Yes, Mutti. - How bad? - We've been listening to radio broadcasts from England. - Dance music? But for three curious boys it's an innocent mistake. - Not a mistake, Mutti. We would listen to the BBC London. Helmuth typed up what we heard into anti-Nazi leaflets and we distributed them throughout the city. - Just once? How many times? - Once or twice a week for six months. - Why did you do this after all that I said? - I had to do something! - But I said to be careful! Rudi! (knocking) - [Gestapo Agent] Open up, Gestapo! - What do I do? (banging) - The Lord will protect you, Rudi. - [Gestapo Agent] Open up! Frau Wobbe, open this door. ♫ Be still my soul - [Gestapo Agent] Frau Wobbe, open up! ♫ The Lord is on thy side ♫ Bear patiently - [Gestapo Agent] Open up! ♫ Thy cross of grief or pain - No! - [Gestapo Agent] Open this door immediately! - I tried that already! - [Gestapo Agent] Open up! - I asked God for help! I asked him to help me not get caught! (banging) I prayed so hard, Mutti. It didn't work. It didn't work! - Rudi, that is not the way we-- - (crashing) Are you Rudoplh Wobbe? - Come with us. - No, please, please, no! Mutti! No! Mutti! (sobbing) (melancholy music) - Oh God, please protect my son. (typewriter clicking) - Full name! - Rudolph Gustav Wobbe. - Where do you live? - Vardenstrasse 15-- - [Gestapo Agent] Date of birth! - [Rudi] 11th of February 1927. - What is the full name of the Nazi party? - National Socialist German Workers Party. - Name the date Hitler was appointed Chancellor. - The 30th of January, 1933. - What is the first commandment of every National Socialist? - To love-- - Face me when answering a question! - To love Germany more than anything. - [Gestapo Agent] Who put you up to this? - No one. - [Gestapo Agent] Who else is involved? - Nobody. (punching) - [Gestapo Agent] That's a lie! - There was no one else. - Have you ever listened to foreign radio broadcasts? - No. (punching) - Did you listen to BBC London at Hubener's house? - No. - While at Hubener's apartment did you ever listen to any foreign broadcasts? - No. - Hubener told us he gave you the leaflets! - He didn't. (punching) - Schnibbe confessed to handing them out. - That's a lie. (kicking and grunting) Karl said he burned them. (kicking and grunting) (crying) - Now, now Rudi. You go by Rudi, don't you? Why did you do this? - I don't know. - You must have been pretty excited about learning the information you were hearing. Couldn't wait to talk about it with some of your other friends, maybe? - I never spoke to anyone about it. - Come now. What about your mother? She knew what you were up to, didn't she? - No, no, no! She never knew anything. She's an upstanding citizen. She would never do anything to harm the Reich. - Get up! (kicking) I'm not finished yet! - I would do it if I were you. Those hands could break every last bone in your body. - We know Hubener gave you the leaflets! What did you do with them? - Nothing. (punching) - What did you do with them? - Nothing. (punching) I passed them out. - [Gestapo Agent] Who did you give them to? - I just put them in mailboxes. - Where? What streets? (speaking German) - But that's not all, is it? Is it? Tell me where you put them! (keys clicking) - I also posted them to the official bulletin boards of the Nazi Party! (crashing) (sobbing) - Try and calm down. Breathe. It's gonna be alright. Breathe. Get your breath. Good. There you go. That's better. I'm Hans. - Rudi. - First time interrogation, Rudi? - Yes. - The first is always the hardest. It will get easier. - I don't think I can stand anymore. - You have been strong enough so far to risk it. - You don't understand. If they beat me for one more second I would have confessed everything. - I felt the same way my first time. But next time I learned I could endure through more than I thought I could. It's struggle, made me stronger. - I don't want to learn anymore or grow any stronger. I just... - [Hans] Yes? - I want to go home. - Do you believe in God? With him we can be strong. He'll help you if you ask. - I did ask. I asked and I asked and it hasn't done any good! - Will you let me help you, then? - It doesn't matter anymore. - Is the war over, the enemy defeated? - No. - Then it still matters! - There's nothing I can do now. - Even here you can continue to fight by resisting their attempts to break your spirit. (door opening) Listen to me. They will try everything to make you feel alone, hopeless, weak, worthless. If you're going to survive you have to resist their influence. - Rudolph Wobbe, come with us. - Where are you taking me? - You're wanted for further questioning. - No, no! - Apparently they aren't satisfied with the lies you told the first, you swine! - [Rudi] No, please! - Don't give in! Remember, you have to resist! - Shut up, you! (punching) - Resist! - [Marie Voiceover] 17th of May, 1942. Subject, juvenile criminal case 87. (punching) I hereby request an acceleration of the above mentioned case because my son, who is now 16 years old, is experiencing great emotional suffering in prison. I am a war widow, employed as a custodian. It is very hard for me to be required to watch my only child go to pieces emotionally from the results of confinement. I have great love and concern for Rudi, despite his actions. And now my nerves are all frayed up because of this grief. It is therefore, my fondest wish that the main trial will be soon begun in order that I may be freed from this terrible uncertainty of what will become of my boy. Thank you for your consideration, Heil Hitler. (thudding) - Thank you. It's been a pleasure, as always. Where's Hans? - None of your business. - [Gestapo Agent] Your indictment papers. - We won't have to put up with your smell around here much longer. - Rudolph Wobbe. Charged with preparation of high treason and aiding and abetting the enemy. Trial date, 11th of August, 1942 at People's Court of Germany. - The Blood Tribunal. - There must be a mistake. We're not dangerous criminals, we're supposed to be tried as juveniles. - Not dangerous criminals? The Blood Tribunal? You'll be punished for your crimes against Germany, you traitor! - I didn't commit any crime, I just listened-- - What? What did you do that was so innocent that it landed you a date with the People's Court? Huh, come on, tell us what you did! Huh? - I don't have to confess to you. - [Gestapo Agent] Come on, let's go. - It doesn't matter. (laughing) You're being tried by the Blood Tribunal. You don't stand a chance. - [Gestapo Agent] Let's go. - Wait. What day is it today? - The 28th of May. - Two months. Just two more months. (train whistling) - I've taken off your hand cuffs, so don't try anything foolish. - I'm afraid we're not going to cut very dashing pictures of romantic resistance fighters. - It's so good to see you again, Helmuth. - What a happy reunion this is. What fine accommodations, too. An all-expense paid trip to Berlin courtesy of the Reich. - It's good to see you too, Karl. - Hello, kid. Herr Professor. - Karl. Well, we might as well get comfortable. (coughing) - [Rudi] How long do you think it will take? - [Helmuth] The train? - [Rudi] No, the trial. - I don't know. You nervous? - A little. But I'd rather be in the hands of an impartial judge than back with the Gestapo. - Rudi, it's the People's Court. It was created by the Nazis with judges handpicked by Hitler himself. How impartial do you think they can be? - Someone will speak for us. - Probably not. I doubt the defense will produce any witness at all. - What about our friends and family? - Well if they spoke for us they'd be labeled traitors as well. - I guess I hadn't really thought about it. - Don't you remember how everyone deserted Heinrich? We have no one left at all. - Well we have each other. For the time being at least. - Maybe there's no one willing to speak for us now. But once Hitler's defeated everyone will be grateful for what we've done. We'll be heroes. - Shut up! We're not heroes, Rudi! You're so naive! We've wasted our time, we put our families in danger. We've endured torture and Hitler continues to spread his lies. We've made no difference at all! - [Helmuth] Karl, what's gotten into you? - What's gotten into me? Six months! Six months of torture and brutality! Moldy bread and soup that tastes like dirt! Not being able to sleep at night because I can't drown out the sound of constant screaming and crying! Not being able to sleep because I can't help but think about my future and my family and the danger that I've put them in. Six months of hell where the weak ones don't surivive. - We know what it's like in prison, Karl. - I'm sorry. It's just I'm not going to be the one who's lost his mind blubbering in the corner. - We all decided together to do what we could to pass on the truth. - Well I didn't plan on getting caught! - Then it's me you should be getting mad at, not Rudi! - What happened, Helmuth? - I spoke with Werner Kranz about translating the flyers. When I showed him one he was horrified. He shoved it back in my face. I didn't know the office overseer was watching. He questioned Werner, called the Gestapo. 10 minutes later I was picked up. When the Gestapo took me to my house they found the typewriter with a half finished leaflet in it. It was going to be my best one yet. I knew then I didn't have much of a chance. I thought I could still keep our promise. - What did they do to you? - They beat him to a pulp, kid. What do you think they did? - Did they? - I'm sorry I told them your names. I couldn't help it. - We don't blame you, Helmuth. Do we, Karl? - We were all idiots to think we could get away with it, that's all. - Karl, did you confess? - I told them I burned the flyers, if that's what you mean. - Good. That's what I told them you did, too. - Thank you, Rudi. - This will all be over soon. - Keep telling yourself that. (train creaking) - Helmuth. - Yes, Rudi? - We did make a difference. Didn't we? - I, I don't know. Does it really matter so much? I mean, if you had the chance to do it again, to fight against evil knowing perfectly well you wouldn't really change things. Would you do it? (train whistling) (ominous music) - Helmuth Gunter Hubener, born on the 8th of January, 1925. Rudolph Gustav Wobbe, born on the 11th of February, 1926 and Karl-Heinz Schnibbe born on the 5th of January, 1924. You are hereby charged with preparation to high treason and aiding and abetting the enemy in times of war. Schnibbe, it says here that you admitted to reading the inflammatory flyers given to you by Hubener first in 1941. And that you were aware the contents had been gathered from intercepted enemy broadcasts. You asked Hubener for more flyers in 1942. You admit to discussing some of the content with the co-accused Wobbe, but claim to have burned them without passing them to other persons. What were your motives in requesting these flyers from Hubener, if not to pass them to others? - I was just curious. - Curious, enough to ask for them repeatedly? - It's possible that I asked him for each one he wrote. - Possible? - I don't remember exactly. - Wobbe, you admitted to distributing the inflammatory flyers given to you by Hubener in that same year and that you were aware the contents had been gathered from intercepted enemy broadcasts. You passed them in hallways, mailboxes and attached some to Nazi Part bulletin boards. What were your motives in helping so blatantly to defame the Reich? - I, I don't know. I mean, I have no reason. - Were you dissatisfied with the way the country was being run? Or angry with the government in some way? - No, nothing like that. - So you simply committed these crimes for no reason! - I, I later realized I'd made a mistake. - Hubener, you admitted to listening daily to the enemy broadcasts and then typing their propaganda into flyers which you sought to distribute to the people of Hamburg, thereby demoralizing the citizens of Germany and bringing them into danger. What possible reason did you have for distributing these newscasts? - Before I state my reasons, I must say again that I alone am responsible for this. - But why did you do it, boy? Or do you not know, either? - Quite the opposite, actually. I knew exactly why I did it. I wanted to share with others what I had heard. My goal was to point out the differences in the newscasts so they, too, would learn the truth. - [Judge] Do really believe those horrific stories are the truth? - Without a doubt. - You ignorant children! What do you have against the Fuhrer? A man who has given us jobs, who has put food back onto our tables and purpose into our lives. A man who has rebuilt our country and given us back a sense of national pride. A man who is leading us into glorious battle so that the world will acknowledge again Germany's power. - Hitler is a liar, a murderer and a tyrant who has taken away our freedom and is destroying this country! - Enough! Although you are charged as juveniles the circumstances of the war make it impossible for the law to waver from imposing the harshest possible punishment. Therefore, the People's Court of Germany hereby sentence the following. Karl-Heinz Schnibbe, for listening to a foreign radio station and distributing foreign radio news, to five years imprisonment. Rudolph Gustav Wobbe, for listening to a foreign radio station and distributing foreign radio news in connection with conspiracy to commit high treason, to 10 years imprisonment. Helmuth Gunter Hubener, for listening to a foreign radio station and distributing the news heard in connection with conspiracy to commit high treason and treasonable support of the enemy of which we have written proof, you are hereby sentenced to death. Do you have anything further to say? Schnibbe? - No. - Wobbe? - No. - Hubener? - Yes, I must die even though I have not committed any crime. Your turn is next. - Vermin like you must be exterminated! The protection of all good German citizens demands it! - Take them away! (ominous music) - I don't believe they'll do it, Helmuth. They'll reduce the sentence, you're too young. - He's right. - No. Look at the walls. Franz Grupper, sentenced to death. Goodbye, mother. - Sophie, take care of the children. Farewell, beloved. - I do not want to die. Dietrich Schultz, sentenced to death. - Still don't think they mean it? - But it can't be. - You knew they were going to do it, didn't you? - They had to have someone to blame. - It didn't have to be you. You deliberately drew all the attention to yourself. Why? - I was the one caught first. Tricked by the beautiful spy. - They can't do this to you. It isn't fair! - Don't worry about me. I know God lives. He will be my judge. - [Rudi] This can't be the last time we'll see you. - We'll be together again. When this life is over. (all weeping) - How about a song? For the Fatherland? One last time. ♫ Moonlight and roses ♫ Bring wonderful memories of you ♫ My heart reposes ♫ In beautiful thoughts so true ♫ June light discloses ♫ Love's golden dreams sparkling anew - Wobbe, Schnibbe. You two are in the wrong cell. Hubener goes to Plotzensee to await execution, you go back to Hamburg. - Karl, auf wiedersehen, my friend. (weeping) - Auf wiedersehen, Helmuth. (tragic music) - (speaking German), Rudi. - [Rudi] No, no! - Remember me. - [Rudi] No! - Remember, Rudi! - No, no! - God be with you both! (thudding) (screaming and sobbing) - No! No! No! No! (tragic music) 20th of August, 1942, Aufmorgen Prison. Dearest Mutti, I am all alone now. The trial is over and I have said goodbye to my friend Helmuth forever. I was so naive thinking we could make a difference. I thought we could change the world, but now I see that I am nothing. I have accomplished nothing and life means nothing to me anymore. I hope my life will not last long. Oh Mutti, I'm sorry for everything! I don't know what to do! I can't face 10 years in this place all alone! Mutti! I just want to die. (speaking German) - [Mutti Voiceover] Resist the temptation to give in to despair. You must survive and continue the fight. - I can't. There's no one to help me. (sobbing) I'm all alone here. I'm so alone. - No, Rudi. No. You are never alone. Even when there is no one else. God is with you always. Turn to him and he will help you resist the despair and the evil influences that surround you. Without him we are, all of us, weak. But with him we can be made strong. (speaking German) Mutti. (tender music) - Dear God in heaven, help me. Please help me to not feel so alone. I can't do it without you. Bitte. Please. Please. God, please. (crying) (hymn singing) Hello? Guard. Guard! - What is it? - Where's that singing coming from? - There's a chapel below us, it's the Sunday service. ♫ Be still, my soul ♫ Thy best, thy heavenly Friend ♫ Through thorny ways ♫ Leads to a joyful end. (laughing) ♫ Be still, my soul ♫ Thy best, thy heavenly Friend ♫ Through thorny ways ♫ Leads to a joyful end - Thank you. Thank you. ♫ Be still, my soul ♫ Thy God will undertake ♫ To guide the future ♫ As he has the past ♫ Thy hope, thy confidence ♫ Let nothing shake ♫ All now mysterious ♫ Shall be bright at last ♫ Be still, my soul ♫ When change and tears are past ♫ All safe and blessed ♫ We shall meet at last ♫ All safe and blessed ♫ We shall meet at last (somber orchestral music)
