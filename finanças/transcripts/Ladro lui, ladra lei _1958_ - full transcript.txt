THE TWO THIEVES - Have you had a bath, Cesira? - Yes. - Did you use soap? - Yes. What a question! Spartaco said to tell you he'd like to be that soap. - What does he mean? - Nothing. Come on, you've been sitting there for two hours! EUROPEAN EXPRESS TRAINS - How do people do it on trains? - They don't keep the door open! - Sure, they're respectable! - What a kid! Let's start! All to your places! Who's goalie? It's Armando's turn, but they picked him up this morning. It's the same each Sunday! The Fortitudo guys take him to play in Tivoli. - This time it's Civitavecchia. - There too! Morbillo, the First Division guys came in a jeep and handcuffed him. and he plays for the Flying Squad now! It's always the same! Who's goalie on Sunday? - Amilcare's out on Sunday. - What time? - You should know! - At 11, they're precise. 10:15 you get registered, 10:30 you get your clothes, 11:00 the three gates open. - Problem solved. Have you made up with Amilcare? Yes, I took him a loaf of bread with roasted pork at Regina Coeli yesterday. Then tell him the match's on Sunday at 2 pm! Sure! He spends three months in jail and comes to play? You're mad! - What about Cesira's brother? - Cesira, is your brother out? - He might get out this week. - Didn't he get 3 years? That's the younger one, the other's out this week. - Hi, Cesira. - Hi. Let's hope so, with ten players like you, we're sure to lose. The best Tiburtino III players are in the Third Wing. They should buy players from the Third Wing, not Argentina. But the warden won't sell them. Guess which team I'd arm? 1st round, Third Wing beats Lanerossi 5-0. - Cesira, you're a stunner! - Babe! Vamp! - Drop it! - Shut up! Funny! Why is it me they always have fun with? - Maybe because you're like Marilyn. - Why? When she has a shower, she can't wet her feet. - You can't wet your heels either. - Spartaco, stop it! That was a compliment! Guys! The ball's over there! - But Cesira's over there. - Cesira, you're all we needed! Cesira! Cesira! Cesira! Stop it! Don't you like it? Your body helps you! Right! It helps me to lose my job! I've had to change five jobs! It helps me to get hugged and pinched by employers who can't keep still. And they're married too! - They're the worst! - But some employers are decent. Where are they? We're salesgirls too. I work for a decent man now. He's not married and he's handsome. I've been there a week and he's not looked at me once. - He might be like Mrs Giulia's son. - No. - If he won't look at you, he must be... - No, he's a decent man. - What's his name? - Raimondi. - Raimondi? - What? - What did you get from the new girl? - A bang on the head. - What? - Hit that bugger on the head! - You're the one who got hit. - Who are you talking about? Cesira, the girl I sent you last week. Goal! You made me miss it! - Let's pull off a comeback! - Rubbish! Rome wins 3 to 1! Who scored for Lazio? I want to hug him! - Burini. - And they wanted to sell him! Speaking about bumpkins, hasn't that bumpkin of your brother come? - No, he didn't want to see Rome lose. - Poor wretch! Do you have any hopes? - Shall we bet? - We don't take advantage of the dead. Do you want to bet? Lazio loses, you leave in your underwear. Like last year! He had stripy underpants! - Alright. - So you like showing your legs! - Illegal touching! - Illegal touching? Speaking about illegal touching, have you tried with Cesira? She's a nice girl, she's worked in all your shops, you said she was a "hot" salesgirl and you didn't get anywhere with her. - It's like a football match. - True. He touched with his hands and she gave him a free kick! - I'm talking about you. - True, my knee's still swollen. It's your turn now. If she resigns, she'll go to Cesaretto, but I think she'll play along. No, she's a good girl. I think she'll only accept after marriage. Correct, what are we on about? After marriage! - The three of us are married. - And smart! I don't get it, don't you put her references to good use? - You're mad, or you don't like her. - He's also mad if he doesn't like her. - No, I like her! - So do I! I almost fell in love! I like the gentle, delicate type. Kick the bastard in the mouth! Come on, Rome! 4 to 1! You're great! Are you Benvenuto Cellini? - Are you doubling? - No, the underpants will do. - Down with the trousers. - Lazio's disinterested, distinguished. Lazio doesn't care about the final result, it prefers a good game. A very refined game. - Dance a calypso, Lazio fan! - Calypso! - Marlene, you're fatter than last year! - Nice calves. Are you singing a lullaby to make them all sleep? - Kiss the wolf! - Stop it. Kiss! They won't take it! They won't take it! We've whipped them! - Mum! - Cencio, dear! - Mum, how are you? - Alright and you? Me too. - Cesira, how are you? - As you see. Let me have a look. - You've become beautiful! - How are you? Alright. - Isn't my brother coming? - No. He's been transferred to the Civitavecchia prison. - Didn't you know? - No, I didn't. He refused the vaccination. We all got vaccinated. Why? There's an "Asian" epidemic outside. I hope we get an amnesty soon... Cesira, you're gorgeous! - Cencio, who are they? - Who? The Bertuccis! Are you mad? - We were playing. - Play with the warder! We can't, my brother's already strangled one. Stop it or I'll tell your mother. - Not mother! - Yes I will! They only fear their mother. Mum, remember the Bertuccis? Cesira, you can't, they were... When was the first time you got arrested? - We were kids. - Kids! They were kids! Just think, they stole a tram at 9! Then they stole bigger things and got arrested. Cesira, I'm sorry your brother was transferred. - You won't come back now. - I'll come with your mum on Sunday. You won't stay here forever. Time flies! Three years are long with no amnesty. - Mum! - Mum, Colomba! Ssh! Calm down! - How are you, Amalia? - Well and you, Colomba? Fine. Have you said hello? - Our respects, madam. - You brought them up well. Children cause great sorrows, but also many satisfactions. - When are they getting out? - Only when a war breaks out. Last time they got out was for the 1943 bombings, right? - Yes. - They're kids... Cesira... Cencio... You said walking under a ladder brought bad luck. Stop it. You're tactless. Don't get angry! I wanted to see how you behaved with the new girl. - She's very pretty! - Yes, she's a pretty girl. The ladder's to see her legs. - I think she's a serious girl. - Serious girls have crooked legs. - See you, let me know! - Bye. Let's check this week's price tags, Miss Cesira. Yes, Mr Raimondi. - Hello, Mr Raimondi. - Hello. - Let's start with the remnants. - Fine. - 1.80. - 1.80. - 2.60. - 2.60. - 2.05. - 2.05. - Did you have fun on Sunday? - So-so... 1.95. 1.95... What Sundays a girl like you must have! 2.30. Sundays aren't special for me. 2.30. Everything's special with you. - Hello? - Raimondi, what about Cesira? That material's ideal for the morning. Morning and evening! A nice two-piece, Raimondi! I'll let you know, bye. - 2.60. - 2.60. - This material would suit you. - If I buy it, we'll starve at home. - 1.80. - 1.80. Do you know why it would suit you? - 2.30. - 2.30. It would suit you because your body helps. - Hello? - How's it going with Cesira? Hurry up, don't be an idiot! How can I get on with it if you call me every two minutes? I'm very busy. Don't tell her to do an inventory after closing hours. I did and I got slapped. Bye. - 1.30. - 1.30. This would be better. The remnants must suit clients, not me. - They can suit you too. - Because my body helps? 1.30. - Why, doesn't it help? - No! 1.30. Look! Are you the owner of the shop or the window-dresser? - I'd do anything with you. - And you would be serious? Mr Raimondi's out! I see, he didn't make it. - 1.60. I even defended you! - 1.60. From who? 2.20. I told my friends you were a serious employer. The other five were all loafers. - What did they do? - What you'd like to do. - Serious, you! - Why, aren't I serious! - It's not my fault if you... - I've understood perfectly. - I'll give it to you. - I don't need it. It suits you. So I've lost my sixth job too! I've had enough! Enough! Keep your hands off salesgirls! We come here to work, not to do what you'd like us to do! - He's been waiting 15 minutes. - You should've said I was out. Don't be so childish, go to him. This is more comfortable than a chair! - Good evening. - Good evening. Close the door! Mum says I mustn't close the door. - Why have you come? - I wanted to talk. Mum, I must go to bed, I've got an early start tomorrow. - Cesira, I took your dressing gown. - Alright. He's one of my brothers. Good evening. I'm sorry, but I have to pass to get to my bed. I'd like you to leave, we've nothing to talk about. You must've understood. Miss Cesira, don't send me away, I've come for a serious reason. You had no right to come. - I'm sorry for what happened. - I'm even more sorry. I'm willing to make it right. - Will I get my job back? - That's not possible. You made a fool of me in front of the staff, I had to sack you. So what do you want? Why don't you leave? Did you want to see if I was poor enough? You've seen it now. I don't want your help. I know you're upset I've come, but don't feel ashamed. I didn't need to come to know how poor one can be. It looks like the suburb where I lived. Trains went by in front of my window too. Long, nice trains. They used to mesmerize me. I watched the people at the windows. Once, a sleeping car stopped in front of my window. A man yawned and stretched right into my face. I was so angry I threw a tomato in his face. - Why are you telling me this? - So you see I'm sincere. It's as though I'd hurt myself, I'm sorry. I could give you good references, you'd find another job immediately. The only way I wouldn't be sacked would be if I owned the shop. If I gave you some remnants, you could open a little shop. I started like that too, in a sort of basement. The door was so low everyone banged their heads. - Are you joking? - No, I'm serious. I don't want anything in exchange and if you wish, we won't meet again. Accept, I'm sorry I hurt you. I'd like to be forgiven. - Is this the only reason? - I swear it. It would be a small gift: the rent for 3 months, lengths of material I wouldn't sell. - Thanks, I cannot accept. - Please. - Is that today's paper? - Yes. Let's look at the ads. There: offers, spaces for rent. There are plenty, there's a choice. "Bargain: San Giovanni area, one-door shop, to rent." - I haven't even asked you to sit. - Thank you. Excuse me a moment. - Mum, make a coffee. - Shall I heat this one up? - No, a fresh one. - Alright. Look at these cups! - Can I borrow two good cups? - Yes, come. - Have you got guests? - Yes, one... I see, your eyes are sparkling. - Silver spoons? - Yes! It says "Grand Hotel" but what do you care. Thank you! People, Cencio's out! Your Cencio's back! - Cencio, did you get out sooner? - We got an amnesty! - So my son will be released too? - No, he's got to serve 30 years! - What about Otello? - Only if you send him a suit! - Why? - He got arrested in his underpants! Mum! - Cencio... - Mum! My son! Mama's boy! - How have you been? - You ask! It's not the first time. I was given the usual cell, poor father's cell. The director is very kind, he has it cleared even if it's occupied. Even if there's a celebrity, he'll send him away! - The director was happy. - Really? Yes. We sang and acted out a nice play for him. Regina Coeli's nice, even the Lord is comfortable. - As I'm a lord, I'm fine there. - What are these? - I stole the costumes from the play. - What for? - I'll give you the hat. - With the feathers? Come on! It's not feathers you must bring, but blankets. Your father was a man! He brought me blankets. I've always done that too, but this time I couldn't. They cried when I left, but I had to come home! Cesira stopped visiting me. Give me the silk shirt. Watch it, the guys from Gorizia have been looking for it for a year, since they couldn't find it on the dryer. The 10,000 liras I left last year are still here! This is a house of honest thieves! We're not thieves, we're half-mad. - Don't wear the silk shirt. - I must be smart for Cesira! Forget Cesira. Why, is she ill? She's not ill, but forget about her. Cesira has other things on her mind. - Is she engaged? - I don't know, but she works. She works? Has she gone mad? - Mum, are you joking? - No. She's working! But who convinced her? Poor Cencio, what has he got in that brain of his? Cesira! - Cesira! - Cencio, how are you? Your Cencio's out! Have you gone mad? My mother said you'd started working. - Sorry, Cencio, I must go. - You must go? - Who is it? - I'll tell you another time, bye. You'll tell me? - Hello. - Hello. - This isn't a shop. - Yes, it is rather small. It looks like a broken down lift. If you press a button, you go to the top floor. - It's the one I prefer. - Really? Yes, it reminds me of the basement you started in. - Let's have a look. - After you. Take a good look before you choose, I'd take the one in Via Merulana. - I like this one. - It seems narrow. You can only get one client in and without their coats! Don't tease me, I'm happy to start with little. Alright. Come round to my shop, I'll pay you 3 months in advance. Fine. - I'll pay your first expenses. - No, it's too much. You'll need a carpenter for the shelves, a counter... It's the first time I work so hard to lend money. How far apart do you want the shelves, Miss? - I'll leave it to you. - Alright. Cestelli, Maghetti and Valletti hire hot salesgirls and if they play along, they sack them. - But this one... What's his name? - Raimondi. He's a gentleman and kind at heart. - He even offers you a shop. - He offended me and made up for it. But then you'll have to repay. You're naive. Stop it, Raimondi's a decent man. Yes, he gives you pieces of cloth and takes "a piece of girl" like you. - What do you mean? - He wants a lover. Hasn't he invited you to his place to do the accounts yet? You're wrong, he hasn't asked for anything. - What if he does? - It's my business, I know what to say. So why do you ask my advice? You know it all, you're a big girl! Take the shop! What do I care? See you around! Wait! I'm out of jail and he's a decent man. If he finds me here, you'll look bad. See you! - Cencio! - You'll see! Hello? It's me, Mr Raimondi. You're not disturbing at all. My interior designer has to do a job for me and the price could include the setup of your shop. What? He's very good. Why? I think I'll manage on my own. I'd hate to bother you any further. Thank you. - When should I come to the shop? - Now if you want. - No, I've an appointment. - I'm sorry. When then? - After 8 pm. - I close at 7.30. - Let's meet at 8, at your place. - Can you come to my place at 8? Alright, Mr Raimondi. Cencio, why does everyone want to take advantage of me? Because you're lonely and helpless. They take advantage because you can't tell those who try it on that you're engaged... What? If you were engaged, you could say so. How can I find a fiancé in this neighbourhood? The boys of the neighbourhood aren't bad. But when they're angry they become bad! Those 3 dirty devils! - Who are you talking about? - Your former employers. What's it got to do with them? Did you get your severance pay when you quit? Are you joking? I almost had to pay myself. They're married and smart-alecks with it! But I'll have them pay the household tax! - It's a matter of rights! - Do I have the right? Yes, we'll go tomorrow. - It's a matter of rights. - May I ask who you are? Who I am? Let's say I'm the girl's lawyer. - Yes... the lawyer! - It wouldn't have happened with me. The girl had to resign after the attack. By way of compensation, pay off, severance, you give us 200,000 liras and all's settled. If your wife were to know you molest salesgirls... My wife? Come on, young man! I've been married 25 years! I'm having a reception for my silver wedding on Saturday. So what? Do you think my wife's still jealous? You're such a laugh! If you think you can intimidate me with this blackmail, I'll call the police and have you arrested. - I'm for conciliation, don't you see? - I see perfectly well! But it's useless with me. Then allow me to offer my best wishes to your wife for your 25th wedding anniversary, my dear sir! - Shall I wear blue? - What? - A nice striped one? - Please yourself. - Who are those two? - They're with me. - Best wishes, sir. - You've already said that. - Tell your wife... - I've got it! Best wishes, Lady Amalia, best wishes! Best wishes! Best wishes! Are you sure he invited us? The wife gave me such a look! He didn't actually invite us. I didn't get anywhere at the shop, so I thought we'd come here. The wife's here... If we fail, at least we'll get some food. Come, I'll introduce you to the wife. Lady Amalia, allow me to introduce Miss Cesira. She worked as a salesgirl for your husband. Nice to meet you! You remind me of when I worked as a salesgirl for Cestelli! He only hired me to take advantage of me. - Shall we sit? - Certainly. One day he said: "We'll work overtime this evening, Miss". - Don't say things like that! - You see? So we were all alone at the shop in the evening. I was naive, when I saw what kind of overtime he meant... - Don't say things like that! - I ran around the counter and he said: "If I catch you, I'll name you head-salesgirl". - How did it end? - I had him run like a fox! Then I locked him up in the shop for the night. I had the keys and the morning after the staff was waiting outside. I knocked and said: "Sir, I've lost the keys". "The smith said it'll take two days to make new ones." - And you? - Me? Nothing. He kept quiet, I was the one who talked. I said: "If you marry me, I might find the keys now". Is this how naive you were?! I even got fined by an officer who happened to pass by, because I hadn't had a security exit built. - You could've escaped! - No, I would've been ruined, because I wouldn't have met the light of my life! Don't you work for my husband anymore? - No, I resigned. - Why? If your husband helps us, we'll open a shop too. - Are you the boyfriend? - Yes. I'm the boyfriend. She didn't leave because of your husband, he respects salesgirls, he even marries them. But I worry about her working there with Cestelli. Why? Cestelli's okay, but you're guilty too. Me? Why? He has beautiful salesgirls and you're not jealous. - Who told you I'm not jealous? - Are you? Are you asking me if I'm jealous? If I find out you flirt with salesgirls, I'll scratch your eyes out! - So... - So what? Enough talking, it's time to make a toast. Let him talk, I might find out something. He's right, we'd better stop talking. If I went on talking, I'd never stop and he wouldn't stand it. So I'll raise my glass to Mr Cestelli, who after 25 years of marriage is a perfect husband. The simplest good wishes are the best. May you have 200,000 of these days! Alright. I must make a toast now. Thank you for the nice words you spoke and the toast. But 200,000 days are too many for me. They're too many. I'd be happy with 100,000. - Do you want to shorten your life? - Let's make it 150,000 then. - No, sir. - Alright... Then 200,000 will do. I also see that when you need new clothes you come to me. Who says 200,000 is a son of... Are you mad? He's wishing you well. No, it really is a matter of rights. - Do you mind, sir? - Doctor, please. Sorry, Doctor. The girl's been affected, 200,000 is nothing. - I don't owe anyone anything. - That's what you say! - I say so. - You say so! - What's this noise? - It's a watch. - A watch? - With a chime. It has everything, night, day, sun, moon, the calendar! - Is it expensive? - Almost a million. There are only three in the whole world. One belongs to Churchill, one to Eisenhower and the third to me. - You... I like to spend my money this way, rather than give it to anyone! It doesn't grow on trees! Move over, I must get my umbrella, I must go. - Sir... - Doctor. I'm sorry, Doctor, I think it's a matter of rights. If I weren't a gentleman and your wife knew... What? You took advantage of the girl, she had to resign. - If your wife found out... - Who cares! She says: "If you do something, I'll go back to my mother!". If you told her, you'd do me a favour. So, let's forget about it. A man who doesn't care for his wife has all my admiration. Let's shake hands! - Bravo! - I'm beginning to like you. Let's forget it all and never talk about it again. - Farewell! - Farewell. Nice guy! He broke my hand. The watch... The watch! - Cesira, it's an investment. - What do I do with it? Only 3 of you in the world have one, Eisenhower, Churchill, and Cesira! Listen to it, it's lovely! It's a calypso, 4 steps forward, 4 steps backward... Half step to the right and half step to the left... - Isn't he here? - He's not. - Can I help you? - Mr Maghetti. He's in his office. - Delia, Mr Maghetti is needed. - He's very busy. Not for us. Sit down. Tell him Miss Cesira, his former employee, must speak to him. - But he can't. - Can't he? It's useless, this is an uncivilized country. I declare my income, the State doesn't believe it and sends tax agents to poke their noses in as if I were a thief! - Bless you. - Thanks. We do our duty. I know, it's your duty, but the State must believe citizens. This isn't a democracy, it's a police State. - Cigarette? - No, thanks, I've just had one. What's this? Personal notes, nothing to do with the firm. - They could interest us. - These ones too? - Yes. But we have our orders. - But... - What's the matter? - Miss De Angelis is here... I don't care! The tax agents are here! Leave me alone. But the biggest tax evaders are unhindered, right? This is the country of corruption! Democratic corruption. The tax agents are here? I'll have a good laugh then! - Did you tell him the lady was here? - Yes, I said she had to speak to him. You must tell him there's a matter of rights to deal with. Alright, but the tax agents are here, I know what he'll answer. Who cares about the tax agents! The tax agents?! This is just the income, let's check the expenditures. Taxes, employees, wages, representation expenses. You don't know what representation expenses are! - Bless you. - Thanks. I earn 70,000 liras a month And when my brother-in-law comes I can hardly offer him a coffee. So you know what representation expenses are! Who is it? - Sir, those people... - Go away! Sir... shall we smoke a cigarette now? I'll smoke mine. Where have they gone? - Why have we come out? - The tax agents are there. So? God knows how much he's defrauded! We'll help him. My father used this trick, he said he knew the way not to pay taxes. What do you want to do? It'll be quicker to show you than to explain it. Tomorrow you go back to the shop and tell him you have a friend who can help him not to pay taxes. - Would that be you? Yes, who else? Sure, it's me. Are you sure your friend knows Mr Lauricella? - They're in the same office. - Let's hope for the best. Here it is, room 234. Newspaper! May I? First you come in and then you ask! How can I help you? - Are you Mr Lauricella? - Yes. - I've come for the agreement. - Have you got the convocation? - The convocation? - Yes, how am I to find the record? - Must I go through all the files? - You might have to. - I think I've lost it. - It'll take at least two hours! Call me. - Had I known, I'd have the convocation. - You must bring it! I'm sorry, next time. - What's the name? - Maghetti Stefano, shop keeper. - Can you come a second? - Yes, dear. Look for the record in the meanwhile. I'll be right back. - Is he coming? - Yes, in a second. - My dear Cesira! - Mr Maghetti. Pleased to meet you. - I don't know how to thank you. - You'll do so later. Let's see what... Let's go somewhere quieter. Let's go to the café. Are you waiting for me? It's for your father, right? It's a delicate situation, we need trust on both sides. - Yes, but trust with money... - Your money's safe. - But it's still money! - Think of how much you're saving. - Half now and half when you sign. - Let's make it all when I sign. You're not signing an agreement with me, but with a colleague. - I'll settle it all. Do you understand? - Not much. Here's half. These are my colleague's. My half's when the agreement's signed. - There's 10,000 liras missing. - How can you say? - It's got the bank band. - Alright, I'll trust you. You were introduced by the lady after all. Sir, the coffees and I also had two pastries. He's put 5? I'm putting half. - Here I am! - What's this? You asked for a record... When the wife calls, you'd better go. - Are you Maghetti Stefano? - No, I'm his employee. - There's been a nasty inspection. - Yes? - Do you have a mandate? - For what? - To negotiate! - No. - It's the mandate or who's concerned. - I'll bring the person concerned. - Bring the person concerned. - Alright. - He'll handle everything. - Alright. - You've had a nasty inspection. - I know. Sign, declare everything, up to the last cent. - What? Everything? - Yes, or we can't deduct the expenses. - But how will you deduct them? - It all turns into expenses. - Who says so? - We do. - Alright. - Because as we officials say, "The declaration of the declaring must be equal" "to the total of the declaration of the declared" "and the total of the expenses must be lower" "than the declaration of what's declared on the declaration". What do you say to that? - Nothing. - Go in then. - May we? - Come in. Thank you. So? - I'm here. - So I see, but what do you want? - I've come for the agreement. - The agreement? But who are you? - Maghetti Stefano. - The convocation? Here it is. - Do you agree? - Sure. I'll tell the truth, then you... - Certainly, you must tell the truth. - What shall we do then? I'm sorry, I forgot my coat. Goodbye. - How's it going? - He says I must say everything. Certainly, then he'll handle it. He's like a child. Goodbye. He's a nice boy. We must help each other. The office has ascertained you earned 20 million in one year. You declared 3. The rest would be expenses: travel expenses, representation and charity expenses. So, travel expenses: 4 million. Lucky you! I'd love to travel too. Sir, I've never left Rome. Who would want to leave this city? - What about the 2 million for flights? - I've never been on a plane. I like landing on a laid table! Then we have 5 million for representation expenses. What's that? Are you really asking? Sir, you know all the things we must invent for the taxes! One million for secretarial expenses. Those are real. You've no idea of what we must invent for the staff! One girl's cold and you must buy her a fur coat, another one has a brother, father or grandfather unemployed. 2 million for charity. For whose benefit? For everyone's benefit. A bribe here, one there... You must keep corrupting! Take your 100,000 liras, we must note it as "charity". - What 100,000? - That I gave your colleague. - What colleague? - The one who came for the coat. - He's your employee. - I don't know him. Neither do I. - Sir... - So, you've never left Rome, so we take out the journeys. The State won't pay your representation expenses. The State won't pay your fur coats either. You are liable for 20 million. - Cencio, what's up, are you worried? - No, I'm thinking. This time I can't boast that I've done a good deed. I've made a man who didn't want to pay his taxes pay them. - Isn't that a good deed? - Certainly. No, it's a crime. - They'll all hate me. - Why? We're all Maghettis in Italy, no-one wants to pay taxes. Just think of that poor sod! - Cesira, a watch like that! - I didn't know you'd be cross. - The money was finished. - Finished? How did you spend it! Listen to him! Every so often I must give him 5,000 liras! This poor son of mine kills himself at work and never has money. It's my fault, Cencio gave me all the money. - He says I've a right to it. - Yes. He's mad. My mother wanted a radio, my younger brother... what's his name? - You should know. - It'll come back to me later. He kept complaining, he wanted a bicycle. Yes, Filippo. If you'd told me, I would've found one. The baker's errand boy always leaves his outside the shop! I used to be an expert. When the bicycle races arrived, I'd dress up as a mechanic. The first one to arrive, saw me, and gave me his bike. I would've given him one with a race handlebar. Damn it, you sold that watch for just 35,000 liras! - Who's this dealer? - He's called Accurzio. - Who gave you the address? - Tiberio. But he got out of jail yesterday! He doesn't know what's going on! "Pistacchio", "The Sheriff", "The Nail", all decent felons. they would've given you at least 100,000 liras! And for 35,000 you gave it to... What's his name? - Accurzio. - Accurzio... He's starting to jump! God knows what's on his mind! I'll deal with Accurzio. I could even raise to the rank of colonel. If you're a colonel, I'm Queen Elizabeth. Make do with your rank of marshal, or they'll find out immediately. - Why? - I could wear it. Come on! Try the salute. What's this? The salute's with the right hand! Don't put too much, a marshal must be simple. - Well done, Morbillo! - Gently, or I'll break your arm. Is it him? - Yes. - You've fenced a watch with night, day, sun, moon, calendar and chime. I never fenced anything. Is it him or not? - Yes. - I don't know her. Open the safe. Open the safe, come on! There it is. - What's this chime? - I've got a watch with a chime. Really? Get it out. It has the chime, the sun, the moon, night, day and calendar. - So what? - Who gave it to you? The girl has confessed, she stole it yesterday. You can recognize it, only three people in the world have one. I can get the owner over to recognize it if you want. - I didn't know it was stolen. - No? You paid 35,000 liras for a watch worth half a million! Officer, take the girl to Le Mantellate jail. Didn't you know? - What's this? Stolen property? - What are you saying? It's not the first time you've been arrested for fencing. I'll check the register. You're Accurzio Gaetano, son of the late Angelo? - Yes. - Close the shutter. - What do you want to do? - The inventory. - Sergeant, write down. - The inventory? Then we'll go to the tower. I'll dictate. Watch with chime. Then, one, two, three, four, five, six... - Seven gold bracelets. - It's unbelievable. - I'm an honest shop keeper. - Quiet or I'll break your ribs. Look at all this stuff! Seven diamond, emerald, ruby chokers. Seven. I snatch and check. One, two, three, four rings. Brilliant, topaz, ruby and emerald. Write, four rings. - Six strings of cultured pearls. - No, real ones. Better! I'm a marshal and don't know how much this stuff is worth. One, two, three, four, five, six... What's this? Cheap imitation jewellery. Write. This has a double bottom! Accurzio, you can't trick me! Brilliants, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, topazes! How many? 12. More rings, earrings... What's that? A cameo. - Take the case to the car. - Where are we going? We're taking him to Regina Coeli and the stolen stuff to the prosecutor. REMAND PRISON - Shall we go through gate 2 or 3? - Which one was it last time? - Number 2. - Then we'll take number 2. But transiting prisoners go through number 3. Everything's changed now that director Bassetto's left. If they find out, they'll seize my uniform and I'm in trouble! Shut up. I've been told everything's changed at the acceptance office. - Salute. - Hi! You've practiced the salute for two years and you say "hi"! Let's go. - Hello, marshal. - Prisoner arrival. Hello, marshal. Order of imprisonment. To the registration office. Last door on the right. Mind the step, everyone misses it. What's the matter? I've brought one thug here! I've been coming for a year! - Must I sign the record? - Yes. Hello? Yes, director, I'll be right there. - Excuse me, marshal. - Go ahead, sergeant. - It slipped out. - Sure the printing is the same? Mancioli's no good at making money, but he's excellent at printing. We shouldn't have sent Morbillo, he's dangerous when he's alone. Instead of bringing the goldsmith here, we could've left him in the street. No, we would've had them all at our heals within half an hour. 20 years ago my dad brought a goldsmith here. We'll do fine too. You've spent years in jail to emulate your father. It's unfair, to condemn a son who wants to follow his dad's example! Sergeant... Isn't the sergeant here? No, he's left. - Did you see that? - It was Gnaccheretta. He didn't recognize us. Cencio! Lombo! You've been arrested dressed up as police officers! We've not been arrested, we've brought a prisoner! If you go on shouting, they'll arrest us. Injustice has started again since you've left. The Third Wing controls everything. I'll tell you. Listen. You'll tell me another time, or "Big Head" will arrest us. All the better, so you stay and we'll show the lads of the Third Wing... - I must go. - We must go. - Who cares! - What are you saying? Cencio must stay! - Gnaccheretta! Look who's here! - At last, it took you two hours! - Morbillo's here too! - Stop kissing, we must go. - Cencio, you can't go. - Be a good boy, let go. Come, Big Head's back. Good, so you stay here. I'll go and tell him. Where are you going? What's up? What's up? Cencio... Calm down. At your command, sir. - Here's the sergeant. - Excuse me. Give me the paper. Here. - Alright? - Yes. - Goodbye. - Marshal... Sergeant... - Who are you? - 103. - What are you doing in there? - I'm cleaning the stove. - How did you get in? - Through the pipe. - How did you manage that? - I was forced in. Luckily I heard you, I was going to light the stove. Are you leaving me here? A roman proverb says: "At Regina Coeli there's a step," "whoever hasn't gone up it once isn't a Roman". It's really true. When I saw that step, I was moved! I understand my father, he felt like crying. He was old, but each year he had to go up that step. He wasn't even from Rome, but Norcia. - And my grandad... - Let's hide this stuff now. My father hid it... But they found it. We must take everything apart. - Let's melt the gold, and the stones... - Where shall we put them? Where shall we put them? We put the stones in... No? - Mum... - Yes? - Don't use this toothpaste. - Why not? - I've hidden some stuff inside it. - What? Diamonds, emeralds, rubies... I took apart the jeweller’s rings and put them here. Be careful, they're hard stones, you could break a tooth. You work even now we have a fortune in toothpaste? Your father came back home with some fortunes too... But I still went on knitting. They're long-sleeved jumpers. You'll need this, you'll be in there for a while this time. - Who told you they'll get me? - They always do! It prickles! Do you think I'm a fakir? - Mum, don't tell Cesira. - About what? These. She thinks the money I gave her comes from the sale of the chime watch. - Why mustn't I tell her? - There she is. Cesira doesn't understand these things. We must prepare her, tell her little by little. I'll tell her later. I'll give her a gift from time to time. The Durbans for the ring, the Gibbs for the brooch... I'll put them here. Don't tell her. - Hello. Cencio? - He's putting the toothpastes away. Mum! Hi, Cesira. Come in, I'll be right there. I can't wait to see you in a neckline. Your friends will be so jealous. - Where are you going? - To a shop. It's Cencio's idea. - He has a new one every day. - He says I should dress better. As we're decent people now, I can afford it. He says we've become decent people, but I don't understand. - Don't you? There's all that stuff... - Mum! If she says she doesn't understand, let her be. You don't understand either. I gave you a new hat and you don't wear it. - Quiet... - Don't make a show of me at the shop. - Maria Lele is such a fanatic! - Who is she? I don't know her either, but she bought material where I worked. All my employers went to her shop. They said: "If you have dinner with me, I'll buy you a dress from Maria Lele". Is it called a shop now? Let's go. - Lucky you who don't know the world. - Goodbye. Bye, Cesira. - Do you really like this dress? - Yes. Do you? You look like an officer. If you turned up suddenly, I'd be scared! - Try another one. Is it possible? - Certainly. - Gaia! - Gaia... - Are you Maria Lele? - Yes, why? I thought I'd already seen you. This dress is called "The Fox Hunt". - The fox hunt? - Yes. What a fox! These clothes aren't good. We'd like something more... I wouldn't know what to show you... You don't like anything! This one's called "Déjeuner sur l'herbe", that is "Luncheon on the Grass". What are you wearing? I'm embarrassed. We want a dress, not an umbrella. What material is it? - It's the finest wool! - No, it's "morling" wool. - What's that? - Wool from sheep dead of disease. They're looking at us as if we were bumpkins. How embarrassing! They've put an awning over you! - I like this one. - So do I. What is it called? "The Kreutzer Sonata." - How much is it? - 50,000. This is a "sonata" for Cencio! Do you like it? Let's take it, but I'll never come back here! Good! I didn't want to let you in in the first place! Deadbeat, chicken thief! Hey! Aren't you Zaira, the ragwoman's daughter? - Who are you? - Pompeo's son. Pompeo's son? So you're Cencio! You should've said! - What about your dad? - He's dead. And your mother? She sews for me now. - Is she still at the Quarticciolo? - Yes. Go to see her. - But I live at the Parioli. - I knew you'd made a killing! She's my childhood friend, the "ragwoman". - Tell me, what wool is this? - Ladies, go to the other room. - What wool is this? - It's "morling" wool! - May you...! - May you...! Cencio, it's madness to spend all this money. Money's made to be spent. You've always dreamed of going to Venice in a sleeping car. Yes, but now I'm here, you know what? I'll get off. Are you mad? I've booked the sleeping car. - But I have the upper bed. - Good, you won't hear the wheels. - What if I banged my head? - Come on! Could you really bang it? - Is it dangerous to sleep on the top? - No. Your Grace, 11 and 12. Cesira, you're with a "Grace". - Oh please! - Yes! - That fatty's a "Grace", right? - What do you want? - They've been here for two hours! - You must answer, it's your duty. Cencio, stop it. Are you starting a row now? - They'll send me away. - Are you joking? We've paid the ticket! Sleep well. Tagadam, tagadam, tagadam... - What if I fall out while I sleep? - You say "pardon" and climb back up. Say "pardon", it's French. These are international trains. - Are they international trains? - Enough! I'll split his head like a watermelon. - It's leaving! Let's hope for the best. - Don't be scared. Remember we've paid the ticket, you're a true lady. Ring the bell if you wish and ask for anything you want. Mind not to ring the alarm bell. Look out for any blanket or hanger we could take. Watch the one with the hat, he's a spy. - Did you tell mum to be at the window? - Yes, they're all waiting for you. They want to see you go by. - How much for the empty one? - Nothing. Hands down! When's Cesira passing? I've already said two rosaries! Say a couple of Requiem Aeternam for that poor sod of your father! - You're so touchy! - Alighiera's right to be proud. What nonsense! It's just a bed on two wheels! My son sleeps on the vegetable cart every morning to go to the wholesale markets and doesn't boast about it! Let's hope the light turns red so it slows down. - Cesira! - Cesira! There's my daughter! Cesira! She looks like a real lady! My daughter, a sleeping car! Cesira, I'm here! Cesira, look at me! - You look so good up there! - If it stops, the landing will be soft! If you find a double bed, I'll join you! When you turn, put your hand out! Cesira, you could've worn your nightdress! She was born to be a lady! Cesira, is there a toilet? - Are you Cesira? - Me? No. It's closed, sir, can't you see the sign? Do you want to lose your job, girl? Call Maria Lele, say Cencio's here. - Who? - Cencio. - Wait here, madam has a "défilé". - A what? - "Autumn Rose". - Lovely! - Have you seen the stalk? - Look at the petals. - This is a flower to grow. - Go on to the next one then. - Mrs Maria Lele, how much? - 150,000. - All of it? - Only the dress. - I could get a discount. - Are you taking it? The dress goes to my wife, I'll take the model. - Our intentions are serious. - What a shame, I only want fun. - "Dinner Invitation". - Booked. Sold to this sir. No, I booked the dinner invitation with the young lady. Mr Cencio's here for you. - Excuse me. - Please. - Are you having dinner with me? - I'm committed to the gentleman. Thank you. - What about after dinner? - I'm free. What do you mean? What kind of a joke is this? Is there a guy who wants to transfer the money abroad? Yes, of course. Then instead of transferring the money abroad, we'll transfer it to our place. - Do you want to see me in jail? When you want to transfer money, you can't report it. This way he'd go to prison too. But he could come here and what should I say then? You tell him a client of yours can help him transfer the money because her brother is a high priest. Lombo, tighten it up a bit more. You're good at making officer uniforms, but you're not an expert with priest clothes. This cassock has a story. Remember, mum? 20 years ago, my father wore it and hid in the confessional and got the confession of a friend who'd stolen his wallet. - How did it end? - His friend confessed everything, so he leapt out of the confessional and punched him in the head! The people waiting to confess said: "Look at the penances this priest gives! Let's leave!" - At last! - It wasn't easy. Nice! Bravo. But it's too small. I couldn't take his measurements while he preached! - Widen it a little. - Leave it to me. Remember, Maria Lele said she doesn't know the high priest, and that he's the brother of one of her clients. We'll do as we did for the taxes. You wait downstairs, I'll go to the first floor, I'll look out of the window, when he arrives, I come down, you come up and we meet. So I say: "I'm sorry, the cardinal's sent for me," "can we close the business here?" - I see, in the stairs. - Let's go to the café. - No, a priest in a café! To the pizza restaurant. Where did your father take them when he dressed up as a priest? The last time he took them to the tavern, but he got drunk, started swearing and they all went to jail. The rector said to make the request. Father, how can I help you? - I'm waiting for Father Amedeo. - Who is he? Is he Italian? - Yes, from Mondragone. - I don't know him. - They come from all over the world. - I'll wait. - Do you want to talk to me? - No, I'll wait for Father Amedeo. I need to talk to you, but it'll take just two minutes. He must be important, maybe a Monsignor. If the socks are red, he's a Monsignor. But they're checkered! They've closed the window! He can't make the signal. - Are you sure your friend will come? - Certainly. Cencio can't stay there too long, they could discover him. I don't understand this delay. Maybe something's happened. Wait here. Psss! - Any news, lawyer? - You can imagine, you read the books. When they get to this point, I close them and stop reading. The end is obvious. You'd better close and go bankrupt. And send the little money you've got left abroad. I've already found someone to help me, a high priest. Are you still here? Do you know what time it is? The priest's cousin has been waiting half an hour. I'm coming. She's the one who knows the high priest's relation. - Monsignor Maggi? - He hasn't arrived yet. My God! God knows who he's taken me for... I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I was reading... One doesn't want to be disturbed when reading. He's mistaken me for someone else. - I don't understand him. - Speak to him in Latin. - Ah, right, Latin! - Latin. Sure, we can speak in Latin. Thank you. What do I say now? So, in Latin... - Patter. - Patter? - Patter. - Patter? "Patter nost qui es in caelis..." Bearded sod! - What a doll! - Look at the "leggy"! - You're a knockout! - Go away! - Who do you think you are? - Fanatic! Psss, Cesira... So? I can't, there's the guy with the beard. - You're gorgeous! - Are you alone? Come with us! We've got the vehicle and the money, come with us. Psss! Young men! Are you talking to us? Tell us. What? - Move along! - Move along? - So, are you coming? - We'll take you around the world. Look at them! Holy... Psss! Young men... - Not again! - Father, are you talking to us? - Go away! - But why? You'd better. Go on. - If it annoys you, go away yourself. - Beautiful! - Hey! You must leave! - Why? - If I tell you to leave, you leave! - But why? Go away! Damn... Well... I... I give up. At last! Your brother the reverend is waiting, let's go. - Is it him? - Yes. There, the reverend's sister. So? Let's go. I'm sorry, but the bishop's expecting me. We can talk here. - Father... - Stop it, Cencio! - Yes, stop it. - What's the matter? - He had to take the money abroad? - You're pathetic! I didn't know a thing! You could've told me you knew him! Wait! Pathetic us? Pathetic him! If I'd known it was him, I wouldn't have dressed as a priest. We've wasted our time for that wretch! Where are you going? - Where are you going? - To Via Tiburtina. - To Via Tiburtina? - Yes. Have you got anything to say? - No. - Then go! With all the people around, we had to find him! - Him or another is the same. - No it isn't! Didn't Maria Lele have another client? And what does he want to export?! - But this is not the end of it! - It is for me. - I'm tired of this life! - You say that, but then... I'm serious. I've never been so embarrassed. Cencio, have you looked at yourself? Look at yourself. Look at yourself! - What am I to look at? - Look at yourself! - What are you looking at? - She said "look". - Look ahead! - Who on earth made him a priest?! CLEARANCE SALE - How can I help you? - I didn't know it was you. Wouldn't you have done it if you'd known? I know it doesn't matter anymore. What you think of me... It's all clear now. I know how you live. It was useless to come. - Don't worry, I won't report you. - You can, I deserve it. I'm not here for this. Do you remember when you came to my house and told me I shouldn't be ashamed of being poor? When you went away yesterday and gave me that look, I saw what I should be ashamed of. I'm only sorry I was wrong. Sometimes you think you know someone, but they're different. I could tell myself, "I was wrong" and that would be the end of it. But I can't bring myself to give up with you. I'd offered to open a shop for you. You thought I was an honest girl. I liked the idea I could help you and I wanted to see you again. But not like yesterday. - I've always liked you. - Hello, Mr Raimondi. Hello. Excuse me. I've studied the book, the situation is serious, but not desperate. Do you have any relative or friend who could help you? - Maybe some friends. - Good. But I don't like asking for their help at the moment. - Try. Forget your pride. - Hello. - Here's the printer. - I've the drafts of the other banners. So? EVERYTHING BELOW COST FOR CLOSURE Do you like the font? Look the Q has a French cedilla. - Are you closing? - Yes. If you don't like it, I can change it. I can use the "Fantasy" font. - Have you read it? - Certainly. I printed it manually! The font is unimportant, the meaning doesn't change. You'd make a good impression with the "Fantasy" font. - Excuse me, how much is this material? - One moment. I'll see to it, Mr Raimondi. Let's see the price. 5,700. It's excellent quality, it lasts forever. It would make a wonderful suit. You won't find it in any other shop in Rome at this price. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - These colours are the fashion. - Alright, I'll take it. - How many meters? - 2.80. Alright. One, two... and 80. Mr Raimondi, the till. 16,500. - What else do I have to tell you? - A speech should be longer. I can tell you one more thing, actually, I should've spoken to you ages ago. - It's the last time we meet. - Why? - Are you leaving? - Almost. - We won't meet again for a while. - Are you ill? - Have you caught the "Asian". - No, I'm suffering here. - Is the heart on the right now? - No, it's still on the left. The wallet is on the right. You eat the tail with your hands! I could still be saved if you helped me. - Is the tail finished? - Romolo, a clean napkin! - "Every man for himself, God for all". - These are hard times. The taxes are eating me alive. It's been a nightmare this week. Why? They've closed the spinning mill in Gallarate. - They've closed it? - Yes. You see? Cheers. I shouldn't have talked. We must keep our troubles to ourselves. Bankruptcy is good luck today. You leave everything and instead of the money, creditors get 2 ounces of stamped paper. If you're smart, you start another firm in another place and you're fine. When one of us goes bankrupt the blow's massive, 20 or 30 million. If you need help, we're here. 100, 200, we can make a million in three. - What? - No? Romolo, talcum powder! Bring over the talcum powder! - No? - No. If only I could go bankrupt, but dad's old and with old fashioned views. He says a shop owner who goes bankrupt is an impotent husband. - Who do we give the last mouthful? - To the handsomest, as a consolation. Eat it, all will go well! - Here's the talcum powder. - Do you want some talcum powder? He asked you for millions and you give him talcum powder? Yes, for the stains. Who wants talcum powder for the stains? You just need a song and with two gentle notes I can feel you in my arms. I love you, but you don't see it. You see, Raimondi? "I love you, but you don't see it". I feel I'm dying already. I must talk to you... I just need a sigh and whenever I sleep I dream only of you! So Cencio convinced me to help him, but we had no idea it was you who had to export the currency. Luckily it was me, or God knows how it would've ended. - Are you glad we tried cheating you? - Yes. I would've done anything to get out of that neighbourhood. Mr Raimondi, I only dreamed of living in a real house, marry a decent man, someone different from the people I know. I've two sisters who have married in the neighbourhood. Maids don't live the lives they live. Cleaning the kids day after day and going round with swollen eyes because if the husbands drink too much, they take it out on the wives. I did it to get out of that life. Be careful next time you meet a girl like me. Cesira, it's not all your fault. We make the salesgirls work for 26,000 liras a month. It's unfair to be standing 8 hours for that amount of money! And when the girl's pretty, some employers... for the same 26,000 liras a month... I behaved badly too, I disrespected you. - Can you forgive me, Miss Cesira? - You're asking me... If I hadn't bothered you, you'd still be a salesgirl now. - Mr Raimondi, don't say that. - Why? You're the best man I know and I've wronged you so much. I wish I hadn't been a thief, Mr Raimondi. No. No. No. No. No. Wait. It's him. - Sure? - Yes. Take a good look, you must've seen him at Regina Coeli. He's been often. I see so many, only when they go in or out. I don't remember them all, but it really looks like him. You must be sure. Go to see him, I'll get you the address. Alright. - Hello, marshal. - Who are you? Marshal, last week you handed over a prisoner to me. I remember, you were at the acceptance! I thought I'd seen your big head. I wasn't sure either, you're out of uniform today. - I'm off duty, good day. - Do you live here? Yes. I've come to see a relation at the Tiburtino and... what a chance! - It's been nice meeting you. - Yes, it was. - I'll walk with you. - I've arrived. - Do you live here? - Yes, here. - Please tell me... - Sergeant, I'm busy. - Am I disturbing you? - No, but... I didn't find my relations and didn't know what to do, but luckily I've met you. - Goodbye. These are nice houses, is your rent high? No, you know how much we're paid. - I see. - I'm glad of that! I'll say goodbye, I live here. Madam... Granny, you got up? You must stay in bed! You're 104 and want to act as a young girl? - Is anyone else in? - Who is it? Sit down, feel at home, is there anything you'd like? - Are you staying for lunch? - No, thank you. - We have a guest! - I wouldn't want... Grandma, stay with the gentleman, I'll go and tell the others. - Hello. - Who are you? - An acquaintance of the marshal. - Of who? He's invited me for lunch. There's no marshal here, what do you want? - Hello. - Hello. Who is it? - I can't believe it. - I swear I'd gone to see the shop, but it was always closed. And since I didn't know, I'd even sent you some clients. Sometimes I told clients I didn't have a certain material, but they could find it in a shop on Via Panisperna. With all the problems you had you still thought about my shop? Yes. What a shame it all went differently. - If I'd listened to you... - It's all the same, nothing has changed. That's not true, many things have changed. I feel good with you, but it's unfair after all I have done. Miss Cesira, do you want to know something? I stole when I was 17. One night I went to steal tyres. I didn't want to, the older boys of the block took me along, many were career criminals, like your friend Cencio. The police chased us and even shot at us. I remember that as I ran I swore to myself... that if I saved myself, I'd never go stealing again and that's what I did. You kept your promise, I went on stealing. Not exactly... When I published ads saying, "Raimondi sells off everything at half the price" I did it to attract people to my shop. I sold the first 100 cuts at a low price, but then I sold another 1000 for double of what they'd cost me. So clients spread the word that I gave my goods away. - How would you call this? - You're exaggerating. Exaggerating? Think of an employee who earns 50,000 liras a month and buys his son a coat for 8,000 liras when I paid 4,000 liras for it. Am I exaggerating? I did the same as you, but I didn't take any risk. Now you know everything about me, I've something to tell you. If you steal one more lira, I'll kill you. I'm serious, I will! And I promise that from now on I'll earn less. - May I speak my heart out? - Yes. Let me tell you why I don't want to steal anymore. I don't want you to be the wife of a thief. - The wife? - Yes, I want to marry you. I don't think I could find another girl like you. One like me? Yes, one who sees she can stop being wrong when she's been wrong. I wanted to transfer abroad the little money I've got left, but I won't. I'll pay my debts and restart, clean. Would you marry me? I'll marry you! Get the documents in the morning. If you see that priest with a thief's face again, I'll kill you! First I marry you and then I kill you, got it? Why are you crying? I'll marry you, but do you love me? Yes, very much! What a shame I realized so late. It's the ideal to get out of this neighbourhood. And I love him. We'll start from scratch, with little. It's better than living a life in perpetual agitation. You've done the right thing. Run away from this suburb. - Have you told Cencio? - No. Then do so quickly, or he'll know in 1970. - What are you on about? - Clemente's here again. Luckily I've finished knitting all these jumpers. My husband always said Regina Coeli's windy in winter. - What has Clemente told you? - He never says anything. He's like family to me, he doesn't even like arresting. Wait, I'll get him a glass of wine. He's 60 now and will retire soon. He's like family to me. He always arrested my husband and Cencio too, he does his duty. Cesira, even if you get married, visit Cencio from time to time. - What has he done? - He emptied the jeweller's shop. Clemente, what do you want? I must take you to the police station, they want to question you. They want to know if you know about the theft at the jeweller's. I don't know anything. Must I wash my face for this? The new warder's there, he wants everyone to be clean. I'm clean now. Let's go. Have you washed behind your ears? You must make a good impression. - They're clean, let's not waste time. - Brush your teeth then. - My teeth too? - Yes, in case you must smile... - Shall I laugh now? - Brush your teeth. You need toothpaste to brush your teeth. - Who says I need toothpaste? - I do. They all use toothpaste in this neighbourhood. Lombo, Morbillo, The Nail. - What are they? - Their toothpastes, yours are missing. Well done, Clemente. How did you find out? I'd noticed all your white smiles for a while... So I wondered why all this toothpaste got wasted. Let me go and check. - And here we are. - Yes, they'd never brushed them before! Precisely. - Nice. Is it Durbans? - Yes. Then it's sapphire. Is everything here? Yes, you didn't give me the time to brush my teeth as I wanted! Sergeant, I'll be ready in two minutes. Mum, the blue suit! The blue suit! You'd think he's going dancing when he's arrested! - Hi. - Would you like a glass of wine? If you serve me wine each time I arrest him, you'll get me drunk. - Cencio, I'll wait for you outside. - I'll be right there. - Why did you do it? - Because I'm a thief and half-mad. Then I'm a thief too. They'll never believe I didn't know. - I was seen with you at the jeweller's. - You'll explain. - You don't know a thing! - What about the jeweller? He'll get 10 years for everything he fenced. I'll deal with it once inside. - I'm scared. - Of what? You haven't done anything. If they question you and tell you I've confessed, open the window and look at the sky. If you see two moons, it means they've told the truth. If you see one, it means your Cencio hasn't betrayed you. - What happens then? - I'll get a couple of years. My dad got 10 years because he'd dressed as a captain. I was a marshal, I'll get a discount. I've lots of friends at Regina Coeli, they'll be glad to see me. What's this? Are you crying? Look at my mum, she's unmoved! Mum, you must feel faint in court, so the judges are touched. Don't you remember what the prosecutor said last time? He who makes his mother cry is a delinquent. Do you want to laugh then? I'll get your jumpers ready, but don't forget them in there. I'll make a list, so I hope he'll bring everything back home. So, two jumpers, three long johns... Bye, mum! Cesira, I almost forgot. Best wishes! Did you know I was getting married? As long as you're happy! Visit me. Bye! Let's go. - The girl's innocent. - That's for us to decide. - Say everything in order. - An informer told me everything. - An informer? - We're organized. - Go ahead and stop joking. - Alright. The informer told me a girl had stolen a watch and taken it to a goldsmith. The one I sent to jail. He also said the goldsmith had given the girl 35,000 liras. So I went mad and dressed up as a marshal. Go ahead. I went to the girl and did justice. I told her I'd arrest her, she fell for it. Then I went to the jeweller and he fell for it too. But when we got out of Regina Coeli, I released the girl. She was young, pretty... It was an act of clemency. Was I wrong? - I know you would've arrested her. - You're a thief and we're policemen. You can treat thieves like you as you wish. Alright, you may say I'm a thief, but a thief with a heart! Go ahead. You told the girl to get out of the car. Yes. At Ponte Sisto. She started crying. She said: "Tis the first time!" - What? - "Tis the first time!" - Tis? - It means "it is". It was the first time she'd stolen. - Where is she now? - I don't know, I don't know her. She said "'tis" because she comes from Bologna. She said she was a maid in Florence and now was in Rome, because her master... You see? So she quit service and stole the watch for food. - Where do you think she's now? - I might be able to tell you. - She was going to Bologna, then France. - Get out an alert. At your command, sir. Why did you want him at Regina Coeli? - To give him a lesson. - Do you know how much it'll cost you? For once a thief enjoyed taking a robbed man to jail. Walk on! Guys, your Cencio's back! Cencio, thank God you're back! They broke the stove to get me out. Hi, Gnaccheretta! Cencio, it's Amilcare. What does my wife say about me? I should get 30 years to tell you everything! Cencio, it's Gorilla. What has my mum sent me? A kiss. - Come and give it to me. - Hairy wretch! Braciola, your brother-in-law sends his love. But my sister's 10! She was ten 15 years ago. Time never goes by for him! - We're the Bertucci brothers. - What do they say about us? They've put the copper cables back and removed body guards from buses! Watch the Bertuccis, they'll leave us without any light. - Remo, weren't you out 6 months ago? - I got out, that's why I'm here! Now I'm nice and settled, I got life imprisonment! Let's hope you get it too, you're my best friend! - Let me touch wood! - You've got lots of friends here. Yes and they all love me. My dad, my grandpa, my grandpa's grandpa, they all came here. When I die, they'll have a gravestone saying: "The Cencio family lived here since the 17th century". - Ragana, am I in the usual cell? - You're here. - You're with me. - Who are you? It's me. Come up, dear, come. Look who's here! I'd forgotten! Big Head! THE END
