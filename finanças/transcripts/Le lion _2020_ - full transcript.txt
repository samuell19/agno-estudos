A MISSION OF CRAZY Sorry. Hello, Anna. Happy anniversary, honey. You know? I have thought about everything that we have not been able to do. Swim together in the turquoise waters of Polynesia, visit Tanzania. Kissing on top of Kilimanjaro ... Behind you, right at 6:00. I think they detected us. Just those two? No. What is your plan? As usual? No no no. I told you no! - You're good? -Yes. - And you? -Yes. Shall we have another? Vale. Two Manhattan. Manhattan? Yes. The check, please. And now what do we do to get out? The output is a matter of trust. Without parachute. From a seven-story tower in Dubai. You are right. A piece of jump, We fell straight into the Sheick Abdelmalek El Flatar Olympic Pool . Interesting! And who are you? I just told you, I'm Dr. Tardi. I stand in for Dr. Faquire. You took out Faquire, right? No, Dr. Faquire is on leave. Permission? Yeah right. Well boss! I need to get out of here. I have to find Anna, she 's in danger. You will have to tell me something else. Start by telling me what it's called. Léo Milan, codename: The Lion. You know well that Léo Milan does not exist. That is not his real name. Of course not, it's a cover. Are you silly or what? If I tell you my real name, I'll be signing my death warrant. And yours too. THE LION FANFARRÓN Good Morning. What are you doing here? Can't you see I'm in session? I have to give him 30 mg of phenobarbital. Again? I just follow orders. - Leave it to me, I'll take care of it. - However you want. Thank you. Don't prick me. Don't prick me, please. I have to be lucid to save Anna, she needs me. It's okay. Thank you. But now you must tell me specific things. Very well. I am an agent specialized in localization and hostage recovery. I work for Constellation. - Constellation? -Yes. Constellation. The spy agency that Zodiaco runs. It's top secret, that's why you don't know it. I see. And how is it to be explained then that we have found him naked, in the midst of a dementia crisis, in the Rambouillet forest? Rambouillet, Mr. Milan. That is not Dubai. Hear one thing. I fell into the pool with the woman of my life. After that I don't remember anything else. It's okay? Has no harm been done? Are you kidding me, sweetie? With the training I received, I have become used to enduring pain. I see. Tell me about that training. I've crawled through the fire I have climbed Mont-Blanc blindly. I was more than 20 min in clinical death. I have been Vladimir Putin's double officer . From Vladimir Putin? Interesting. Don't interrupt me, I'm not done yet. I speak Russian, Serbian, Arabic and Chinese. I can pilot any engine. I am a specialist in quantum mechanics. Awesome! Is there something you can't do? The Mayo. I see. Stop saying "I see" because you don't see anything! And put down that notebook! We're not in school, okay? You are right. I have to digest all this information. See you after lunch. Whatever you want, I'm not going to move from here. One last thing, trunk. - Dr. Late! -Yes. If you find out I'm going to be transferred, let me know, okay? Why would they transfer him? To eliminate me. Yeah, sure. I came from seeing 308. What a story, what a madness. Daniel Craig or "You Scare Me"? Don't let the cases get to you. You have to disconnect. I can connect with my patients and even give them a little understanding, right? Daniel Craig is no longer our problem. They will transfer you tomorrow. Are you transferred? - And where? - To the Military Hospital. - And why haven't they told me? - Top things. - What do you mean "top things"? - From high up. Too high for you. I know it looks weird, but do you really think he's a spy? That's the question, I don't know much. It may have been pure chance. It seems to me that it is already very safe. It's my bike, I care about it, what do you want? I remind you that on Saturday we are going to have dinner with my parents. It slipped my mind. But if it is to hear them say It's a shame that we don't get married and don't have children ... I know they are a bit heavy. No, deep down they are nice. You know them, they say it with good intention. And about the patient, do I tell him that they are going to transfer him or not? "If we don't risk, we don't make mistakes, but we achieved nothing. " - That's not Freud's, is it? - No. No. ¿Jung? Neither. Homer Simpson. How silly. - Until tonight. - Bye. Mr. Milan, I promised to be frank with you, they are going to transfer you. - It does not matter! - Morning. - That doesn't matter now! - Oh yeah? There's a van following your girl. How? Those kinds of vans are fake. One of two, she is either kidnapped or killed. Very well. Have you heard what I just told you? Fuck! Are you deaf or what? Your girlfriend is in danger. ¡Suéleme! What do you mean by that? The van! Let go of me! Hasn't the phenobarbital been pricked? Yes, it may not be enough. Yes. Let your girl know! - Doctor, what do we do? - 60 mg. But that's a lot. No! You bastards! No! Come on, kid. Time to go to sleep. One day I will send you to sleep and you will find out. Spooky! ¿Louise? It's me! Yes I'm going! Hey, I advised my patient that he was going to be transferred. And he started to tell me that you were being followed when you left the hospital, that they were going to kidnap you and that you are in danger of death, well , a lot of crazy things. But don't be scared, honey. I remind you that the guy thinks he's James Bond. I am your sweetheart for me it is the most beautiful. Even if it was a puppy That would be fine. I love being your sweetheart and if i feel so good it's because when I hold your hand I feel very happy. Romain, I have to tell you one thing. I have ordered Chinese food. I have ordered vegetarian rolls. See if they bring the hot sauce. ¿Louise? What is this? "Everything is fine, my love. I love you, stay out of this." What is this? ¿Louise? ¿Louise? Can not be. ¿Louise? Answers! Tell me first name, last name and date of birth. Louise Roc. As in "Roca". Born on March 22, 1984. 15th district of Paris. There is no one by that name. It is impossible. You must have misspelled it. Roc, R, O, C. Let's see, have you seen the aggressor? No, he was wearing a monkey mask. A male chimpanzee mask. I watch a lot of documentaries at night, when I'm on duty. On call? In the mental hospital. I know it seems crazy but I saw myself in them recently, with the Lion. He also left me a ... a note. He must have been under a lot of pressure, because ... she would never call me "my love", I am rather her sweetheart. - I see. - You don't see anything! El León is a patient of mine in the psychiatric hospital. He had tipped me off about the kidnapping. - I'm digressing but ... - How are you, Moris? What are you on I will summarize for you, the girlfriend here, the sweetheart, has been abducted by a male chimpanzee. He has left you a note calling you "my love." Yes, but I am "his sweetheart." The Lion warned him, but he did not believe him. That's the problem. It looks very ugly, doesn't it? Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you. So what are you planning to do? As things look ugly, we will put the best men to work. We will comb roads, airports, hospitals ... Thanks, I thought you weren't taking me seriously. Say it? No, this is Kelly's answering machine, you can leave me a message. Bye! Hi Kelly. I am Romain. Can you call me as soon as possible? Thank you. Mr. Milan. He was right! Louise has been kidnapped! Leather interior ... Solar roof... Mr. Milan. Mr. Milan, wake up! Anna, is it you, darling? You're the best. I knew you weren't dead, that you were going to survive. Okay, I understand. Anna, why have you tied me like this? No! No! No! What have you done to me? What were you doing there? It's not what you think, I've injected him with amphetamines to wake him up. Sr. Milan. Sr. Milan. Mr. Milan, concentrate, please. You carry it clear. With what you have prodded me behind there, I am like a motorcycle. Listen, it's very serious. Louise has been kidnapped. I've been to the police but they don't believe me, I don't know what to do. Take it easy! Take it easy! Take it easy! Take it easy! Take it easy! - Take it easy! - I'm calm. Okay, we're both calm. Tell me what happened. We were chatting and having a glass of ... What did I open? A glass of Chablis. Fuck, is the Chablis important? - No. - Well, speed up, man. I was telling Louise what you told me when there was a knock on the door. I went to open thinking it was Deliveroo, I had ordered Chinese food. Then I saw a man in a monkey mask that hit me and when i woke up, Louise had disappeared. He left me a note. We are in shit. - What do you mean in the shit? - It's a decoy. - It's the yellow ones. - That? Yes, the yellow ones, the Chinese. The Peking gang, man. - Where he works? - In a record store. - Fuck. - What happens? Fuck. Fuck. A record store is the most common cover in the spy world. Louise? A spy? That's crazy. It is not clear. When they get what they want from her They will bury it alive in cement or dissolve it in acid. The Chinese are not joking. Beside him, the Saudis are little angels. What I am going to do? Without me? Pray. Could you find it in less than 24 hours? With Taurus, we released a Czech engineer in Guatemala in eight hours. And that we lost time on the road because Taurus had his eye on a Guatemalan woman. The guy lived up to his name. Are we leaving or what? Come on, don't make that goofy face, get me out of here. I'm 99.3% programmed for this type of situation. And why not 100%? Because that would be a lie. Come on, let's go. Let it be clear to you: I help you rescue your girl but in return I never set foot here again. And you let me go back to Anna. - Done deal? - Voucher. Done deal. Now what happens? - I don't go out on a mission with a geek. - A nerd? I don't go on a mission if you're going to waste my time. I'm going to teach you to defend yourself. Don't worry, I have notions of judo. Wait to see. Here I only see a professional and it is not you. - Come on, attack me. - This is ridiculous. Come on, attack. Hit me, man. - Come on, attack. - Nerd. Crab movement. You've seen? You are not ready. Come on, attack. Come on, no fear. Attack me Where is the linnet? Where is? There is. The linnet. Wow, not bad! Let's see... Now I'm going to show you ... an attack. The attack of the lion. The Lion Attack? What is that? - The Lion attack? - Yes, the Lion attack. Look at my fingers. Do you see them? Attention! Attention! You are crazy! The Lion returns to his old ways. The thing is that roars. Be quiet. We have to be discreet. But what are you doing? I have the card! You have to mislead the enemy, surprise him. - Very good, done! - Discretion is for pringados. You have to do it with sparkle, with style. Let's go! Here! Voucher. You have to separate into two groups. You have to separate into two groups. See you in 3.0. Where? 3.0. It's true, you have no training, you are a pipiolo. "3.0" is a code to establish a meeting point. "Three" is three kilometers, "point" is point. "Zero" means the west. It is understood? Three km west of where we are. If I say "2.5", it is two km south of where we are. Five, by the "S" south. Tell me that you understand. Yes, more or less. But... Three kilometers is a bit far. - Well then 0.0. - And where is that? It's here. Stay by me. I told you you were going to find out. Mr. Milan, let's talk quietly. Shut up. Hey, boss. Come here! Tardi? Have you made this mess? Come on! The Lion Attack! I can't, he's my superior. Lion attack, come on. If not, we cancel everything. Sorry, Paul. Look at my fingers. What do you do? You've gone mad? The Lion is the only one who can free Louise From the clutches of the Beijing Chinese. The claws of Beijing? Paul, it's very complicated, they come for him. Who? They will not transfer you. Listen, Tardi! Think about it a bit! I've been hard on you, I apologize but frankly ... Romain, come back to you. Listen to me! He's a psychopath! - Yes, you're right. -Yes. Yes. Forgive me. Mr. Milan, can you go back to ... - You killed him! - With a head butt, yeah, man. He is risen! You're right. You don't help me. And now how do we get out? The output is a matter of trust. Make way! Your turn! Come on, jump! Come on, jump. Let's go! Come on! Let's go! There is not much height! Let's go! Come! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! You're good? What milk you have given yourself! Do you have fun? I have broken two fingers. Let me see. That's nothing. Let's see! You are a psycho! Come on, come on! - Where is your car? - I have no car. It's a joke? I don't have a license, I go by bike. And an electric scooter? I have already tried that, it is very dangerous. We can take Marc's, he always leaves the keys on. No, not a Clio! - Why? - Renault is the enemy. Is Renault the enemy? You are delirious! Not the Fiat, it's the boss's! What a spy, he ca n't even start a car. - What were you saying? - Nothing nothing. ¡No! The card! Come on, come on! I can't find it, I don't have it. I must have fallen when I threw myself. But what are you doing? What are you doing now? You could have warned, right? Putting on the belt. - Where do you live with your churri? - First of all, her name is Louise. I don't understand what use that is if she's been kidnapped. When you investigate, you start with the place of the abduction. I understand, that makes sense. Go straight, the first on the right. I've thought better of it ... I can not believe it. Where does your Louise work? Are we not going home anymore? I see her very clever for that. I don't think he kept any information at home. Let's see if I understand, in case of kidnapping, you start at the place of the kidnapping only if they are fools. Ya vas espabilando. If it was you, I'd go to your house. Ah, thank you very much. Tell me where. Turn and the first to the right. What happens now? I thought I saw Anna in that car. I understand your lack of affection, But don't you say time is short with Louise? - Louise? -Yes. - Who is Louise? - Louise! My fiancee, Louise. It was a joke, silly. What a face you have! And what are you doing now? You are going to kill us! Relax, I control. I see your control. What are you doing? I'm not going with this pint of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. - The secret number? - Nothing about that. Your number, come on. 3236. But be careful, you have to check the option ... "Direct debit". YOU'RE DEAD LATE GIVE ME THE CAR I can not believe it! They are going to kill me! I'm an idiot! Do they cut their hair in Prada? It is not for everybody. A little gift. What is it? A handmade card holder with ostrich leather. It's classier than your plastic pot, right? Ostrich leather. You could thank me at least. But it's my money! And that? It's a gift. No no no! Have you spent 2,174 euros? But what is this! Are you crazy! Sorry, but I don't dress in Lidl clothes. Are you saying it for me? What do you think? First, I buy food at Lidl. And 2,174 euros is twice the minimum wage. Also, I don't have them. Well, you just spent them. Where are you going? This is not the address. The Lion never works on an empty stomach. Never. Well, you have it clear. ¿No comes? I'm not hungry. It will be the debt on my shoulders that takes away my appetite. Don't be a whiner. - Do you have pictures of your girl? - Yes because? I've only seen her once from afar. I'll have to see what it is like if you want me to find it. It is true. It's her? Yes, she is. We were in Touquet. Do not invent. Yes, it was in Touquet. I'm not talking about Touquet. I'm talking about her, it's impossible. Well yes, it's her. And the little one is your son? He is not my nephew. Don't you have children? It's complicated. Is it difficult for you to hit the target? Wow, I think I've struck a chord. But what are you doing? I'm memorizing it. Okay, right? For now. It is done. I have engraved in my memory your blonde with blue eyes. But she is a brunette with green eyes. I'm kidding! Let's go? Time is short. Waiter, the signature book and the bill for the man. ¿350 euros? It was Bordeaux, I told you. You haven't even tried it! If you wear Prada you can't eat at McDonalds. Surprise! I'm so sorry I ruined your Amish life, but I need you. Fuck you, Swanney! You can't talk to your ex like that. How about life with your psychiatrist? After being with a mental patient, I am with the one who cures them. I see you haven't lost your sense of humor. Now seriously, What does a girl like you do with a dummy like him? I want it. That's what I wanted to hear. Here's your sweetheart, see? I don't know what he's playing at but if you don't do exactly what I tell you, I charge it. It is understood? You can go down now. Aki? You won't be serious. How cute it is! Take care of her. My little Solo! You have not changed anything! Let's go! Can't park like everyone else? Have I crashed? It will be the address, it needs revision. The one who needs revision is you. Watch the van, I'm going to give myself a roll. - That? - An acknowledgment. Do you think it could be the same one that was following Louise? I have no idea. But it gives me a bad feeling. Don't lose sight of her! Listen, I'm not leaving you alone. You are my patient. Shut your mouth and do what I tell you! If not, I cancel everything. You don't have to talk to me like that either. Romain, if you're so nice, can you keep an eye on that van over there while I'm going to gather information about your girlfriend? That is much better. Thank you! Good morning, what do you want? Looks like the van was from the florist. ¿Kelly? Mr. Lion? But what is this? Okay, right? Can not be. Romain, who is this nut? But hey! I'll explain it to you, it 's a bit complicated. Complicated? But have you seen the one that has bundled? Louise has been kidnapped. That's why I left you a message. Seriously? Do you think we're kidding? Who is this? He's a secret agent specializing in hostage recovery. A secret agent? But hey! He's sick in the head! - Did you get him out of the madhouse? - But what are you saying! Something is wrong. I worked here two years ago, if there was something, I would have noticed. Precisely. If there is nothing, there is something. What it said, like a goat. No! No! No! I need to concentrate. Tell him to stop doing that. Mr. Milan, don't do that. But where does it go? Mr. Milan. I heard, I've thought it through. We better get back to the hospital. You have already taken a good walk. What is the favorite singer of your churri? I. Okay, very good, your second favorite singer. - Sing in English ... - Bob Dylan. Yes, just what I was going to say. Or Freddie Mercury too, that will do. Heel, heel. We are on the right track, Mouloud. ¿Mouloud? I don't think that's Louise. You can stop calling him Louise now. Julia. But what...? Camilla... - I can not believe it! - Sofia. He likes names with "A". This is authentic. Your girl's name is Jessica Rocher. I can not believe it! I need to sit down for a moment. Can I have a glass of water, Kelly? - I'm a little dizzy. - Sure, you haven't eaten anything. He has not eaten anything. And this visit ends in the Private Rooms of the Governor of the Bank of France, which was completely reformed at the beginning of the Fifth Republic. Can you visit the gold reserves? Public entry is prohibited, you can imagine why. This way, gentlemen. Thank you very much. How are you? Good, good. - The cards, please. -Yes. Thank you. I have done my part, now it's your turn. Would you give him his ...? ¡No! No. You are now an accessory to murder. Password? Password. - No, I ask you the password. - "Password", in lowercase. - "Password" is your password? - If that is. Okay, Jessica Rocher, aka Solo. Alone, what an occurrence. He took his first blow at 17 years old, he hacked into the computers of the General Directorate of Foreign Security. The DGSE, of course, of course. And on September 11, did you see if it was her too? Just ... known worldwide for having invented the "Ghost", a program to obtain computer codes without being detected. I'm flipping. Sure, that's why he called the cat Casper. Like the ghost Casper. Yes, yes, will you let me finish? In 2014 he collaborates with "Los 12 monos", an anarchist organization, there it is. He worked alongside his partner and boss, an Englishman named Swanney. - Couple? - Yes, like a mom and dad. Okay, thanks, I know what a couple is. There is nothing about her as of 2015. ¿2015? It's the year we met. On January 26, 2015. At the supermarket. We sweat it. Not to me! It is clear that Swanney has kidnapped her for her Ghost. I don't think you know Louise. If you don't want your Ghost to be used, no one will. Unless they find a way to persuade her. Why ... do you think it could be me ...? So are you really a secret agent? I feel sorry for the poor man! It is not very pleasant to discover that you are a cover. But it's not like that, she really loves him. - Oh yeah? -Yes. I understand it, because it is very sexy. Oh yeah? And you too. Well, we're leaving. - Come on, we're going to Beijing. - To Beijing? - I do not have a passport. - What a joke, silly. Let's go to Constellation. They have an antenna near here. They have an updated database of terrorists. How silly, we can't. We have to go back to the hospital. Nothing happens, let's go to Constellation. - Insurance? - Yes Yes. You like my style? But what is this? ALARM SCAN COMPLETED Audible alarms? Desactivadas. Thermal alarms? Desactivadas. And the security cameras? - Canceled. - Perfect. From now on, we have ... four hours before the next shift. Six years of Medicine, the fourth of my class, two years of studies on Lacan, 600 sold copies of my work, and it turns out he was living with a computer hacker without having a clue. Women are unfathomable. This is why they are so effective at this. Why? You can't imagine how many state secrets have been revealed in bed. And your girl, with those eyes that she has, the moment I teach them ... I imagine her in the morning, when I wake up, in bed, with that piece of eyes on the duvet ... With that you do get up. Shut up now! Fuck. Okay, don't be mad. I get mad if I want to! And stop touching my nose with that roll of your eyes! You have to find Louise! Solo, it's called Solo. Or Jessica. You will have to get used to it. Now it's your turn. Remember that your boyfriend's life is at stake. Do you know the worst about yourself? You repeat yourself a lot. I like to make things clear. CODE RECOVERY IN PROGRESS What do you think? All the gold reserves of France. 2435 tons of gold. Are you kidding me? Constellation has all kinds of covers, today it is a hairdresser, tomorrow a grocery store , a butcher, a toy store ... - Everything you can imagine. - Already. Well, it looks like a simple hairdresser to me . That's the idea. Let's see, do I look like a spy to you? - No. - Exactly. First rule: Don't trust appearances. So that's a spy, right? Second rule: In a closed mouth, no flies enter. Relax a little, huh? Sir, it's closed. Yes! What happens? I tell him it's closed. I will eat. - Don't be silly, I'm from the house. - Sorry? - Doesn't the Lion sound familiar to you? - No. If you want to make an appointment, nothing until Tuesday ... Okay! For! Maybe he's just a hairdresser. A hairdresser? - First rule? - "Never trust appearances." - Exactly. - It hurts me. We need information. We are looking for a Jessica or Louise. 1.70, brunette. A solid aunt, with two big ... with very big eyes. That's it, exactly with big eyes. It's her. I am a hairdresser, I do not dedicate myself to dating. You have two seconds to get in touch with Zodiaco. Zodiac? What Zodiac? I am not a Zodiac. It seems to me that he knows nothing. No. He is pretending to be a hairdresser. Where is Scorpion? No, I am Taurus, like my mother. You are not Taurus, you are Scorpio. Now it is OK! Vale yes, Sr. Milan. Leave it already! Leave it to the poor man, he knows nothing. He will not speak. It sure is a simple hairdresser. It is clear. You're right. Come on, we're off. No. Forgive all this mess. I'm very sorry for all the inconvenience. Constellation! How could I have believed such a thing? We will never find Louise. Jessica or Solo. Shut up now! You are not a spy. And I am an asshole. - He's still there? - Who? - The one with the van. - Leave it already! If you want you can go home, but I must continue with the mission until the end. - Okay, got it. - Let go. Great evils, great remedies. I'm going to give you a relaxant, it 's for your good. - Yes, huh? -Yes. And are you going to do it by yourself? With the attack of the Lion. Take a good look at my fingers. Look at my fingers! That is not the attack of the Lion, it is that of the lick. I'm warning you, I'm not in the mood. Let's see... "Wedding at the Justin's house at 3pm. A bouquet of roses for the Robins, orchids for the Madar ... " You see it? It's from the florist. No, it was joke. Watch this. - We come out handsome, huh? - The milk! Wow, "extraction in progress." But do we know where they are? Quiet. I am going to download an application, I send an SMS with a hidden link, and if they respond, we can locate them. If they respond. Yes, they will answer. "Shall I charge the psychiatrist?" - Shall I charge the psychiatrist? - Yes. There you have it. DO I CHARGE THE PSYCHIATRIST? No. Don't worry, they're going to say no. You see it? "Not yet". You have had lucky. There is. Fuck, they're in Paris. - At the Bank of France. - The Bank of France? Is there extraction? - I'm going. - Let's go? Good morning gentlemen. We are on a government mission. They can leave in peace. Yes, you can go quietly. - We are secret agents. - Okay, you guys are crazy. Hands on your head. And get on your knees. We have told you that we are on a mission! Is it that your blood does not reach your brain or what? Take a good look at my fingers, attention. Look at my little fingers, take a good look. You knock people down so they talk, I knock them down so they don't talk. There is no time left! I'm very slow with you. See you in 1.3. That? No! But that it does? My bike, clown! Loose lips sink ships! ¡No! Watch out! Take that bastard! Let's go! Watch out! Bravo! Right at 1.3. If it is that when you want ... Maybe too fair. It has hurt. It has hurt. - Come on, hurry up! - Fuck! Vale. I warn you. You're going to get like a motorcycle. Come on, let's go! TRACK AREA PROHIBITED ACCESS The lion? But hey! I can not believe it! I thought you were dead. The king of the jungle always gets ahead. This is my colleague Romain, psycho. - Psychiatrist. - Yes, it is the same. Is not the same! The psychiatrist is a doctor and the psychopath is a bit like you. No way, he's a druggie. Ah, well. Do you know the Lion well? It will be about 10 years. When I worked there, he was the king of figures. It was deadly. Hurry. We must go to Paris. Yes Yes. To save my churri. He is going to rob the Bank of France with some Pekingese terrorists. Says her name is Louise, but in reality her name is Jessica, although in the world they know her by the nickname Solo. Well, it's complicated. I don't think it's possible today, because ... It's Fashion Week, I'm waiting for clients. Come on, in memory of the old days, when you descended the Himalayas blindfolded and the monkeys behind. What does this crazy person say? Bring it on! Hold this, hold it Well done! He's a bore, he doesn't know anything. He doesn't fucking know anything! That's it, that's it! Okay, Romain. Give me that. Give it to me, give it to me, I tell you. Stop. It already. Come on easy. In my life I have been calmer! Come on, let's go. Hey hey. Don't touch anything on the helicopter. Is it true? Quiet, huh? Let's see, this is not ... This is not, this is not ... It is done! - Ready? -Yes. Wait. This is not, this is not ... No. Shit, I don't think it's that complicated. Didn't you say you knew how to drive anything with a motor, What did you know how to make anything but mayonnaise? I told you a lot of nonsense at the hospital . That? Memo. We're. We have come out of this, the most complicated thing is taking off. Stop screaming! It moves a lot, I'm going to throw up. I am used to Army helicopters , not these things. For the Lion it is the Tiger. Or the super Puma. We arrived in three minutes. Ask for an Uber. An Uber? Wait, let me focus, the hardest thing is landing. But was n't the takeoff the hardest thing ? I didn't remember the landing. No no no! We are going to die! What were you saying? ¡Yes! Everything is going to be fixed. Do you think we will find it? God willing. God willing. That is all? Look, even if we don't make it, we've done everything we can. The important thing is to participate, right? Are you talking seriously? Sometimes you remind me of Aquarius, the most depressing sign of the Zodiac. - Thanks, but I'm a Libra. - Even worse. I'm going to tell you something, whether we find it or not, is alive or dead, you should not regret anything. You have done everything you can to save her. Well, in any case, I'd rather find her alive. When we find her, she will be very proud of you. Trust me, you're going to get the most out of those eyes. God willing. Come on, give Papa Leon a hug. Needless. Come here, man. Come on, let's go! Go Go go. ATRACO IN THE BANK OF FRANCE SEND SECURITY Is there? Maybe yes. We will? What happens? From now on, how things can get ugly, they better not know that you are their boyfriend. You have to give yourself a name. Come. Leoncito? That's right, impatient Leoncito. It hits you a lot. Let's see, do the little lion. That's! Perfect! - Leoncito? -Yes. I do not like it very much. - Come on, we're going, Simba. - Simba. It's worth it! Goodnight. Secret services. We have been told that there have been shots. We haven't heard anything. It must have been a joke. Do you want to check it out? Yes, it will be for the best. Are they from the Foreign Security Directorate ? No, we are freelance. Listen, I don't know how you got here. But your journey ends here. They haven't been warned. Leoncito and I are here for you to try our specialty: "Good night, little ones." What are these clowns laughing at? It seems to me that they have not taken you very seriously. Now we see. Kevlar. 10mm thick. Mawashi-geri kick. 300 kg of thrust. The Lion Attack! It will be stupid! Come on, if your hamstring hasn't been touched , it's just a scratch. Bassai Dai. Iron knight. Crab movement. But come help me, stop being silly. I try to understand why I have failed the movement. Aries was the one who taught me all these movements. We were in Peshawar ... Stop stories, I'm going to bleed out. Come on, if you just bleed a little bit. Let's go! That's it, it's over! Come on upstairs. Come now. - Don't squeeze like that! - But it's a tourniquet. Fuck! The tourniquet is made over the wound. We have to go, come on. You have to take up your weapons. No, no, leave them. Leave them. But we go unarmed, how can we do it without weapons? My hands are lethal. They are in category 4, deadly weapons. We don't need weapons. Come on, leave them. Let's go! There it is, an elevator. They must have caught him. Obviously, but it has a code. The governor has programmed your date of birth on everyone. Sure, of course. How had he not thought of that? The governor's date of birth is ... July 18, 1965. ¡Oh, no! ¡No! Of course not, silly! I have taken your card. You are a pipiolo! Come in, come in. Of course, since you haven't had a knife stuck in your leg! Saluda. Voucher. We are almost ready. How is everything up there? ¿Mark? Come in, Mark, over. Yeah, yeah. One... One... one... One, two... probando... You do not know how to speak English? I told you that I spoke Arabic, Russian, Serbian and Chinese, but not English. He speaks Chinese, let me see it. Yeah sure, that's Chinese, right? Mandarin, to be exact. Mark? Mark? Mark? I want to talk to Swanney The head of the monkeys, please. Please es "s'il vous plait". Who speaks? The Lion. - The Lion? - yes, my friend. The lion. In the flesh. Who is this clown? Show me the lobby camera, let me see the mask. Shit! The elevator. NO SIGNAL Very good, Mr. The Lion. What do you want? For now. Don't tell him anything, we're going to look like rookies. So... You have seven minutes and thirty seconds to surrender. If not, I'll be there. And that will be kaputt. That's German. If not it will be game over. It is understood? Very well. Here I wait for you, king of the jungle. Bravo. They didn't know we were here, now they know. We were going to take them by surprise, but now we can't. Very well. Again you have not understood anything. I just freaked out. Now he knows that the Lion is going to attack with all his claws. But he does not know where or when. Yes. Well, I have listened to him dying of laughter. You are very wrong. I'm sure down there right now ... they are scared shitless. They are going to poop in their pants. Also, I have a plan. If things get ugly, you will be the back up. No kidding I'm going up there. They are waiting for only one person. That is the surprise effect. Come on up. I have a leg injury, I don't know if you remember. - Do you want to save your girl or not? - Yes! You are back up. - It's okay. - Come on. Hate, Strength. My leg! My leg! Stop complaining, look how heavy you are. A back up without weapons, often support. If there is a problem, you play the retard. Trust me, playing the Mongolian has saved my life more than once. They are no longer called "mongolos". It is said "people with Down syndrome". Huy, sorry, doctor. Come on, hide. Come on close. Quick, the slit. Are you sure you can? Do not worry. I already did it in Indochina, in the mission "Passage to Freedom". - In Indochina? That was in the 60s. - So what? "And that?" If you were not born. So, what do you know? - You're not 70 years old. - What do you know? While you wait, watch the artist. Rat neutralized. All right, bring it up. Fuck your ass, king of the jungle. Indochina, of course. And now what do I do? Swanney! What is he doing here? I swear to you I don't understand. I have not done anything. Simon, in corridor C there is another rat, go see. It is understood. Do not do it. I'll do what you want, but don't do it. Too late. Swanney, by favor. Eh, you? Who? - I? - What do you think, asshole? Dad? Dad? And this moron? I love you Papa! Stay away. You've seen? Works. It has been close. - Come on, Leoncito, to work. -Yes. Come on, come on. I shit on ...! Take your weapons. Come on come on come on! Hurry! Above! To give it all! You stay with me. Come on, we're off. Close the doors. That you close the fucking door. Look, what newbies. Let's go! Very well. Thank you. Let's go! Shit! Now let's see how we get this fucking door open. Look at the artist! Stop saying that. Do you know what the chances are of finding a 16-digit code? Do you know? No, but in the lottery, which is six figures, it is one in 19 million. - I don't see that we can ... - Okay. If you have another solution, I am all ears. But now, quietly, I have to concentrate. ¡No! Okay. INVALID CODE It's just a 16-digit code , come on, come on. SCHEDULED OPENING It is clear. Can not be! How did you do it? Sometimes I do things that I don't even understand. Let's go! The thing is that roars! That? You had forgotten about the roar. ¡Bravo, Simba! Surrender, you are surrounded. We are two, we are not armed. But I warn you: my hands are in category 4, deadly weapon. And I will not hesitate to make use of them! Shit! They are already gone. Where have they gone? Leoncito, mira. A respect. Bravo for the logistics. A respect. Vale. It's your turn, Leoncito! Let go If we lose them, it is the end. I would like to see you. I'm scared, because of my leg. How did you tie yourself? Are you hung up? You're not hung anymore! I'm fed up! Very fed up! I ran for three days through the jungle with a broken leg, stop complaining. Yes man! Running with a broken leg. What was missing, rats! Let go of the moorings, let go Come quickly! - Notre-Dame or the Eiffel Tower? - It is clear that they have gone east. Bingo! There is. Where, where is it? Where? I do not see her. Where is? Trust me, it's her. Here, take the wheel. Do you manage? Yes I can do it. I got my license from Touquet. Do you have a boat license but don't have a license? Yes, whats up? No, nothing. Fuck! Be careful. Sorry, there is swell. - Swell in the Seine. - Yes, swell on the Seine. You screwed my arm. I jumped rope one day with both broken arms, So stop complaining, huh? You are very heavy! What are you doing there? Simba, You have become a man! Speak clearly. We must part. I find your girl and you take care of the boat. Wouldn't you rather we go together? We will hunt them down with the pincer. I already used that maneuver in Yemen. We were about 10 ... Okay, don't tell me stories. It's okay. Thanks, little Loin. Come find your girl! Not worth it! We are here. Do not worry my love. Everything will be fine. "My love". How cute. The truth, Romain, That a guy like you is here is quite an achievement. I congratulate you. But you... The king of the jungle always survives. You put me on my nerves. So it's over. Game over. Funny, a guy in Afghanistan told me the exact same thing. It was on a mission with Virgo. He told me Game over. And what happened? What do you think if I'm here, asshole? He patted it. Very well. I'm going to make a proposal, think about it. Wait wait. You stay with your girl, I'll take the gold. What do you think? - Agree. - Are you crazy or what? It is a good proposition. Are you going to let him walk away with 2000 tons of gold? Drop it! Drop it! - Leoncito, don't be crazy. - He's right, don't do something crazy. No no no! Sr. Milan. I did it! I am the Lion. Everything will be fine, Mr. Milan. Yes. Sr. Milan. Sr. Milan. And good? I hope he gets out of this, they 're trying to stabilize him. I can't believe you did all this for me. You would have done the same. Do not even dream about it. By the way what is your name? Why... with so much name, it is not clear to me. Jessica. Do you have anything else to tell me? It's a good moment. I'm pregnant. Y... How many names are we going to give it? A dozen? The lion? Is he really a spy? Not quite. THREE YEARS BEFORE LÉONARD LEGRAND, CHOSEN THE BEST SELLER OF THE YEAR THE OCCASIONS OF THE LION Anna. I was waiting for you. Happy Anniversary. Thank you. I've thought of everything we haven't been able to do yet and what are we going to do. Swim together in the turquoise waters of Polynesia. Visit Tanzania. Y... Y... Kissing at the top of Kilimanjaro. I like the plan. You see it, you bastard? I told you I would return. You're going to find out, host! Anna, Anna, Anna! Fuck off me! Let go! No, no. Anna. Anna. Calm calm. Quiet. Help! ¡No! Help me! ¡No! ¡No! KRAV MAGA FULL METHOD THE CONSTELLATION NETWORK , MYTH OR REALITY? And to Léonard Legrand, what will happen to him? They are going to take him to the mental hospital. His days will surely end there. But they can't do that to him. He saved my fiancée and solved the biggest case of the century. You know it's dangerous. Absolutely. He has only invented another life to hide his trauma. It was his way of getting over the pain. So sorry. Let me at least tell you. MILITARY HOSPITAL OF THE ARMED FORCES - Good Morning. - Good Morning. - What does? - I obey orders. Leoncito, how are you? I'm fine. That? What's wrong? Does something hurt? No. I'm fine. I'm fine, I just know who you are. You are... You are Léo Milan, codename: The Lion. You are a constellation agent. And where is Anna? Maybe you should go find her. And how do I get out of here? The output is a matter of trust. A negotiation? Lacks a bit of spark, right? If you're right. With negotiation poetry is lost. How about the Lion attack? The Lion Attack. Do you know about the attack of the Lion? What? What a sweetie. I'm going to ask you to take a good look ... my fingers. Of course, Leoncito, you are full of resources. At this rate, I'm going to ask to be recruited into Constellation. Look through the window. I rented it with a fake passport from Jessica. You are not obliged to return it. The keys are in. We will? I do not go. But you are crazy. We're a team. Jessica is pregnant, well, Louise. What a bitch! I'm kidding, silly. It's great! We will meet later. Yes, sure. Come on, I go out first. Wait. I'm going to miss you, Little Lion.
