(SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Gauff? Yeah? We're ready. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) Grace, she was quite a horse. The best. I'll never forget her, that's all. Never. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) What can I add to that? Well said, Gauff. Why don't we say a little prayer? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (MOVES INTO LIVELY ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hey, kid. You gonna shop, or watch movies all day? It's not like I ever buy anything. Who are you shopping for, you or your horse? My horse, I wish. Oh, I gotcha, you're still dreaming the horse dream. Okay, we're good. If you can't dream, what you got? Take your time.

Can I ask you a question? Shoot. Did you dream about horses when you were my age? Well, yeah, unfortunately, I got busted up in a rodeo fall, so I had to come up with a new dream. You're standing in it. Most all girls go through it, lasts a year or so, then fades, usually replaced by boys. It won't for me. Ah, sounds like me, so what kind of horse you got your eye on? What's it matter, I wouldn't even ask. My mom hates horses. I see, well, the way I see it, Jess, it's your dream, so who knows what can happen if you try. I know what will happen, she'll say no. Yeah, maybe, but can you try? I can try. There you go. Thanks. (PHONE VIBRATES) Look, I don't know what you're selling, but... Randy, this is Dr. Eyer, I'm calling about your mammogram. What is it, what's wrong? I'd like to get you back in tomorrow for another diagnostic if we could. Okay, so what are you saying, I have breast cancer? We just want to be cautious. Okay. Let me, you know, I'll talk to my husband. That's fine, just call us back. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) What's going on? Wow, John. It's just like Mom. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) Hey, wait a second, I'm sure you're fine. Brandy, listen to me, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, okay? Mom! Dad? JOHN: Kitchen. Mom, Dad, I know what I want for my birthday. Let's hear it. Okay, so I've really thought about this, and I promise I'll be, like, totally responsible. Just spit it out, Jesse. I want a horse. That's, that's a thought, right? Let your dad and I talk about it, okay, honey? (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) Well, they say the acorn doesn't fall far from the tree. No, forget it, and I'd appreciate it if you'd stop talking about him. I guess I didn't realize I was talking about him. Did I miss something here? Look, John, I need to be thinking about me right now, not about the drunk who fathered me. (SLOW MUSIC) RILEY: Gauff? Yeah? The vet's here, she said she needs to speak with you. All right, in a minute. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (GAUFF SIGHS) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Ah, just the man I wanted to see. Look, Marianne, I know what you're gonna say. What, Belvedere, oh, he'll be fine, but keep him on stall rest this week, he still has heat in his fetlock. Can we bute him? So he can injure himself permanently? No, sir, I will not. Great, first Grace, now Belvedere. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Need something else? Yes, Gauff. I did, and I do want to talk to you. So? Talk. Gauff, you need a project. What are you talking about? It just seems to me, the way you've been moping. Moping? Yes, moping. (GAUFF SCOFFS) Gauff, Grace was a great horse. The best. But she's gone, Gauff, and no amount of pining is going to bring her back. Oh, hey, Riley. So here's what we're gonna do, young man. I'm not a young man, Marianne, don't call me that. You're young enough. (WHIMSICAL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) You call this man, Gauff, he has a horse that needs a home yesterday, and I told him you're just the man to help him out. Geez, Marianne, I don't need no rescue, I need a school horse. Gauff, remember when Grace was injured? You brought her back, gave her a good life. And think of all the good she did for Riley. You call him, Gauff, I told him that you're just the man... Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard you the first time. Besides, it'll be a good summer project to bring you out of your funk. I'll, I'll give him a call. Did Gauff just buckle? I believe he buckled. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) It's perfect. Look, it's 10 days, that's plenty of time to do the diagnostics, and figure out where we stand. I don't know, I just don't feel comfortable leaving Jesse right now. Then tell her. John, come on. We don't even know how serious this is yet. And why scare Jesse for no good reason? So we send her to camp, come on, it's perfect. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) BRANDY: Where's it at? Westfield, isn't that near where your dad was? I don't know, I mean, it's been a long, long time, John. You know, it's amazing. What's that, Jesse? Did you know that wild mustang were actually brought here by the Spanish? I believe I knew that. Have you guys decided about my birthday present? Actually, we're still kind of kicking it around, Jesse. Do you think you'll decide soon, 'cause... Jesse, birthdays are supposed to be a surprise, so even if we had decided, we couldn't tell you, right? All right. Boy, that girl has a one track mind. Hey, I tell you what, Westfield's about three hours away. I've got a client that I've been meaning to drop in on up that way, so why don't I swing up there, check it out, meet the leaders, get her enrolled, all right? Okay. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) JOHN: There must be something you can do. I am so sorry, Mr. Fuller, but it's just too short a notice, we are completely booked, and that's a fact. But as I explained, Mr... Brother, Brother Jimmy, call me Brother Jimmy. Brother Jimmy, as I explained, her mother has this medical situation, and I'm sure, under the circumstances... I do wish we could, but we have to be very strict about our enrollment, insurance, and such other things. Could she do the July session? Um, no, because her mother... Right, right, doctor. Well, all things according to the lord's timing, but I will lift up your family in these troubling times, brother, I most surely will. I do wish you traveling mercies, Brother Josh. John. John, right, right. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (BIRD CHIRPS) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Eight miles. He can't be that bad, can he be that bad? No. (WINDOW KNOCKS) Everything all right, Brother Josh? J, yeah, everything's fine. All righty, then. Say, Brother Jimmy? Are you familiar with a horse facility about eight, 10 miles up 37? Cedar Creek, sure am, take the camp kids up there sometimes. Do you happen to know anything about the trainer there? His name's Gauff. Gauff, interesting man, had the good fortune to share the gospel with him once upon a time, can't say it went all that well. Brother Jimmy, can I ask your advice? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (JESSE SIGHS) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Mom put the kibosh on your horse dream? Worse. Oh, I can't imagine anything worse, unless they're shipping you off to boarding school. They might as well be, I have to go to camp for two whole weeks. Oh, how many parents you got, Jesse? What? How many? Well, duh, two. What are you, 14? Almost 15. Well, when I was 14, I only had a mom, and she couldn't afford, ah, this is starting to sound like a rubber ducky story. What's that? Ever watch a movie where the hero is a jerk? I guess so. Okay, so you realize your hero's a jerk, right? So who's gonna root for a jerk? There is a point to this, right? Well, yeah, the point is, is you got to have a scene where the hero talks about losing his rubber ducky when he's, like, four. Or 14. Or 14, exactly, so you feel sorry for him, and root for the jerk hero. That's stupid. Yeah, and it never works, either, so the point is, is maybe going to camp could be fun. That was the point? The point is, keep dreaming, you got time, and you just never know how your fortunes might turn. I suppose. There you go, now, you'd better head back before it starts getting dark. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) So you feel your wife, Barbara, might... Brandy. Brandy, right, right. She might disapprove of you reaching out to Brother Gauff? Well, as you know, the lord works in mysterious ways. She's gonna kill me, Brother Jimmy. No, I am not so sure, Brother John. This could be a step toward reconciliation, reconciliation and healing, a step she might be unlikely to take for herself. I guess you do have a point. And perhaps a delightful opportunity for young Jamie, as well. Jesse. Jesse, right, right. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Yeah, I mean, what could go wrong? A lot, a lot could go wrong. (HORSE WHINNIES) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (HORSE WHINNIES) Ain't, ain't much to look at. Oh, fuddy poo. You'll work a miracle with him, I know you will. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hey, Gauff. Hey. Everything okay with the new horse? You wouldn't believe it. Really? Well, yeah, that horse is bomb proof, I think I got me a new school horse after all. That's great, name ideas? GAUFF: Mm-hmm. I like Cadenza. GAUFF: Mm-hmm. Which one do you like? All of 'em. Gregorio, Ronaldo, Antonio, Cadenza, Emmanuel. Okay, so that's his, his papered name, what's his nickname gonna be? Oh, that's easy. (WHIMSICAL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Grace. RILEY: Hmm. You know something, Riley? I think things are finally going my way. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Gauff. Just Gauff, that's me, what can I do for you? Okay, I got to run. Okay, Riley. Well? It's really hot out there today. It's July, you're in a barn, now what can I do for you? Sir, my name is John Fuller. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) My wife's name is Brandy. I'm your son-in-law. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hey, Riley, you got to help me. The August show's coming up, I've got a mess of show bills to get out, Aliyah used to do it all, but eh, she's gone off to school, and I don't know where to start. I'm sure I could help you get it organized. You're hired, Riley, you are a lifesaver. Hey, Bill? BILL: Yeah? What do you know about Gauff's family? Look, it'd just be for a couple weeks while Brandy gets this treatment, and it'd be so good for Jesse, she's obsessed with horses. Son. Dad. Oh, I knew this day would come. What? I said, I knew this day would come. I heard rumors about Gauff having a wife, years ago. Well, there's a gentleman here who I overheard, well, he says he's Gauff's son-in-law. Why didn't Brandy just talk to me? You didn't tell her. Look, Gauff, I'm in kind of a pickle here. She hates me. No, she doesn't hate you. I mean, maybe a little. Can't say I blame her. Well, whatever I can do, I'm here to help. Really? She's my girl. You know, I have to say, you're nothing like, I mean, I'll make all the arrangements, and I'll let you know. Dad? Don't push it. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Can you make out what they're saying? BILL: Mm-mm. You know what I just realized? What's that? That guy looks exactly like Dimitri Stone. I don't see it. Where'd they go? Oh, hey, Gauff. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (DOOR KNOCKS) Hey, Jesse, it's time to pack for camp. Do I have to go? Oh, come on, you're gonna have fun. Can I take my phone? No, sorry, no electronics allowed. How we doing? Somebody's not too thrilled about camp. I got to get my toothbrush. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hey, tell you what, let me go talk to her, okay? BRANDY: Oh, would you, please? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) What do you mean, I'm not going? Well, you are going, just not to camp. Then where exactly am I going? It's, um, it's like this. This is the best birthday present ever. There's one little detail I probably should mention. What? The horse trainer, he's kind of Mom's father. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) Wait, he's kind of Mom's father, or he is Mom's father? So we're talking about the same father that Mom never talks about, and changes the topic when you mention him? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Yeah, so, anyway, I spent a little time with him, and he's older now. Well, obviously. I know, right, and Mom kind of doesn't know about this. She thinks you're going to camp. But why? Her father? Oh, I get it, she's gonna kill you, isn't she? Yeah, maybe, but look at it this way. You get to do the horse thing, and if you apply yourself, Mom's got to be on board, right? So why don't they just, like, work it out? I don't know, honey, it's complicated. Hey, it's our secret, okay? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hey, Mom. Wow. So what's your secret, there, miracle man? Nothing a Frappuccino couldn't take care of. It's almost as if you promised her a horse. I know, right? Yeah. (LAUGHS) (HORSE WHINNIES) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Gauff. Yeah? Hey, Gauff, listen, about this granddaughter of yours. I know, I should have told you about Brandy, and all. No, I get it, Gauff, you had a bad marriage, alienated your kid, she cut you out of her life, and now you're stuck for two weeks with a granddaughter you never knew you had. No need to sugarcoat it. Yeah, happens every day. Yeah, right. I got to show coming up, I got to fix those stupid bleachers, I've got a school horse I got to break in, and now I got to play Grandpa. Riley got those show bills organized, so that's something. Is that what you wanted to tell me? Oh, no, your granddaughter's here. JOHN: There he is. Grandpa! I've been so looking forward to meeting you. Jesse? That's your Grandpa, there. Oh. Nice to meet you. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I got to few things to catch up on, I'll let y'all do the same. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) So your dad tells me you want a horse for your birthday? Yeah. Well, you know, you can't just hop on a horse and go. People get hurt that way, you see. You need training, and so you can be safe. You understand what I'm saying? Is this Jesse? I'm Riley. Riley helps us out around here. You ready to ride some horses? Girl, we're gonna have the best time ever. Hey, Jesse, I think you're in pretty good hands. Are you sure you don't want to stay a little longer? I wish I could, but Brandy and I need to get ready for our trip. Trip? Well, sure, Mom and I haven't gotten away in awhile, and we figured while you're having fun here, we'd go have some fun, too. Okay, love you. I love you, too. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hey, you're not gonna be homesick now, are you? I think Jesse's gonna be a bit too busy to be homesick. You guys have fun, all right? Well, come on. Don't be like Riley here, wear flip flops in the barn. Animals are big, you know, they'll step on your foot, hurt you, you got to be careful. You got anything to eat? Oh, my God, I've had, like, nothing. Yeah. We try not to use language like that here. English? No, not English, the words. "Oh, my God." What, what's wrong? No. The words. What words? Follow me, Jesse. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (UPBEAT HONKY TONK MUSIC) Hey, Benji, this is Jesse. She's gonna be with us for a couple weeks. Cool. (UPBEAT HONKY TONK MUSIC) What's up with the clipboard? GAUFF: Oh, just finding out a few things for Jesse. Oh, well, maybe I can help. Quite a list. You're gonna read comic books with a 14-year-old girl? No. Dog gone it, Riley, I ain't got no experience with this Grandpa business. Look, kids nowadays, you understand what I'm saying? Gauff, Grace. Yeah, I know, God's grace. No. I meant the horse. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (HORSE WHINNIES) Hey, Jesse. (HORSE WHINNIES) I want you to meet Grace. Jesse, this is Grace. (JESSE LAUGHS) Jesse, take the line, we'll take him into the arena. I want you to lead him, okay? (HORSE WHINNIES) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) The other side. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I don't want him out with the rest of the herd, let's water him in the stall, and then put him in the crossties so you can learn to brush him out. Thanks, Gauff-pa. Huh? Thanks. Yeah, well, let's go. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (HORSE WHINNIES) And the next step's the girth. Girth, got it. Hey, Jess. Becky! How's my dreamer doing? How did you know I was here? I've got my ways. Pay attention, Jesse, you got to cinch it up tight, but not too tight. It looks like this one's a huffer. A what? Well, didn't you see that? See what? Your horse took a deep breath because he knew you were gonna tighten him up, sometimes they do it twice when you go snug it up before you mount. Yeah, well, I was about to explain that to her. Pretty boy. Who'd you say you are? Looks your fortunes took a turn for the better, eh, Jesse? Yep, this is Grace. Nice, but it's a boy. (LAUGHS) Listen, lady... Hey, I can't stay, Jesse, I got three more hours back home, but I wanted to stop by and give you a little advice. Okay. You see this man? Gauff, he's my grandpa. You listen to what he tells you, anybody who knows horses knows who Gauff is, and trust me, he knows horses, well, I'll leave you to it. You come back anytime. Just so much is changing, that's all. No, trust me, Jesse's in very good hands. Yeah. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) You know what's funny? What? Well, I can't help thinking what it'd be like if Jesse spent the summer on a horse farm, maybe with old grandad. (BRANDY LAUGHS) I can't imagine anything worse. (LAUGHS) Here, let me show you, kind of go in circles, see? It gets the dirt out, then you take this brush, and you go sort of with the grain, you might say, hmm? Got it. Give it a shot. So did my mom like horses when she was a kid? Um. I, I don't really remember. You were there, weren't you? Not so much, Jesse, I was gone a lot. (HORSE WHINNIES) This the young lady I heard so much about? Oh, Jesse, this here is Marianne, she's our vet. Hi. How's Belvedere? Still lame, Jesse, you and Grace really look like a team. He's coming along. So, are you going to be here for the schooling show that's coming up? I haven't even ridden yet. Oh, Jesse, come on, you are Gauff's flesh and blood, I'll bet you're a natural. Jesse's only here for two weeks, Marianne. Oh, fiddles, she could show him in hand. We'll see. Well, all righty then, think I'll go some place where I'm wanted. (GAUFF SIGHS) Let me show you. Gauff-pa? It's just Gauff. I like it here. Well, that's, uh, that's good. Here, we got to job to do here. I'm gonna learn to ride, like you. All right, Jesse, tack him up, let's go. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Keep those heels down. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) That's better. Sit straight, now, sit tall in the saddle. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) You're riding now. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Well, just keep doing what you're doing, 'cause it's working. MAN: (IN BLUE HELMET) Thank you, Doc. We don't necessarily think it's breast cancer. There is something called a granular cell tumor, and the suckers can get big. They usually show up in the head and neck region, but about 6% of the time, they can mimic breast cancer, that's the bad news. That sounds like good news. Well, you don't want to count your chickens quite yet. I'd still like to get in there, do a biopsy, take a look around a little bit, just to make sure. Okay, so that means I would have to go under, right? I've got it scheduled tomorrow, first thing. I kind of want to see Jesse first. Wait a sec, we talked about this. I know, but, I mean, this is kind of a big deal. 7:00 a.m. is all they've got available. See, and you can't be traveling, you need to rest up, right? I'd certainly prefer it. Fine. Yeah, bring it on whenever you're ready. Hey, Gauff! That was Melvin, we got that hay coming in 30. Minutes? I still got to clean the tack room. And the southwest hall, put the kids on it, it won't hurt them a bit. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Yeah. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (HORSE WHINNIES) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) "Gauff, this is the last time." BRANDY: (VOICEOVER) That you'll hear from me. You don't know what it was like when I waited for you, believing you'd be home soon because you promised you would. Well, I'm never gonna wait for you again, it was bad enough that you missed most of my childhood because you were at rodeos. Well, I never want to see another horse again. Mom would have been better off if she had just left you and raised me alone, I don't ever want to same you or talk to you again. My life is better without you being... Hey, Jesse. (PIZZICATO STRING MUSIC) What's going on here, I thought I told you to get this place cleaned up. I will. Nevermind, I'll do it myself, geez, go on. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Got room for two? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Free country. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) What's in your craw this time? Jesse. What did she do? Well, she ain't done nothing, I, she's just being a kid. And I suppose you were being Gauff? Yeah, well, it's old news, Riley told me all about it. You know what I think? I'm trying too hard. Oh, you're good. Oh, come on, Gauff, you've blown a gasket plenty of times, what's really bugging you? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Brandy's sick. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) That's a wrinkle I hadn't considered. Is she okay? Which is the real reason... The reason that Jesse's here. Oh, my. Oops. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hey, Jesse. Hey. Boy, you and Grace look like a match made in heaven. JESSE: Thanks. Looks like my marshmallow came back from the other place. Other place? Not heaven. And I suppose my fine figure doesn't need it anyway, but I still may try to scare up one more. I'll leave it to you two to enjoy the fire for a bit. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) Um. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) I, uh. I may have been a little harsh today. We're good. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) You like her, huh? What are you talking about? You know. Marianne? I'm not her type. Well, she likes you. You don't know nothing. You never know until you try. Yep. It's what I always say, when it comes to relationships, you just never know until you try. You just have to reach out and try. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Yes, siree, that's what I always say. All right, enough. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Oh, am I interrupting? Uh, she's just playing matchmaker. Oh, really? Who's the lucky gal? My mom. Ah, well, okey-dokey then. Isn't it getting about your bedtime? Oh, yeah, (IMITATES YAWNING) I'm so tired. Night, Jesse. Good night. She's lucky to have you. If she really knew me, she wouldn't have anything to do with me. Oh, come on. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) I know plenty about your checkered past, and, well, I know plenty. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Well, I told you not to count your chickens. It's cancer? We caught it really early. So what's the plan? I say we use every tool available. Whatever it takes. Plan on a followup radiation treatment. What else? What, is that it? It's a good start. Studies have shown that hidden hurts, pain, if they're not dealt with... No, just, we have a happy life, good marriage, we have a great kid, I mean, right? John? John has shared with me some things from the past that... Oh, oh, my, are you serious? John! Can we please get over this obsession with my father? Listen to me, Brandy, when you have pain that is not addressed, it can compromise your immune system. It's like your body is fighting against itself, especially in women. It's probably something that you want to address. Brandy. Brandy. Look. You know what, Dr. Eyer is my doctor, you had no right to go and spill my life story behind my back. Well, it wasn't exactly your life story. Look, you're right, I should have talked to you first. So what else haven't you told me, John? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hey, Jesse. You're supposed to do the stalls first. All done. Already? Check it out. All right. Well, what about the... I already brushed Grace. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) All right, how about the... I cleaned your saddle for you, too. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) All right, then. You want a lesson? We'll take him outside. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) How'd it feel? It felt good. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Is it too late to enter the show? I don't know, Jesse, it is, it's complicated. Dad told me if I worked really hard, Mom would be on board. You don't want to get your hopes up, Jesse. Well, there's no way I can do the show in August if you guys don't work things out. She doesn't want to have anything to do with me. She's probably just hurt. You might want to listen, Gauff. I told you, Jesse, it's complicated. Well, of course it's complicated, lots of things are complicated, women are complicated, aren't they? Maybe if you tried to understand women. Fat chance. What if she was sick, what if she was dying? Dog gone it, Jesse, I wouldn't have any way of knowing that, now would I? Wait, wait, what are you talking about? Look, I'm sorry, the camp was full. Okay, so the camp was full. You said that already. Well, Jesse wants to ride horses, and it was, it was right there, you know? Eight miles, so I kind of reached out to Gauff. You kind of? Jesse is with him, riding horses, right now. I don't believe this. Honey, I wouldn't have done it if I hadn't gone and talked to him, you know? And it's a really nice facility, really good people. Good people? I mean, other people than him. It was not your place. Look, I didn't mean to. I mean, at the time, it seemed like. Well, you didn't want to tell Jesse about all this. Don't you dare put this thing on me. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) You're right. You know, he's my father, and you did not have my permission to do that. Listen, you told Dr. Eyer you were willing to do anything, whatever it takes, you said. I know what I said, John, I was there. All I'm saying is, you need to do this for you, you know? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I'll go. Really? Yeah, I'll go and get my daughter out of there. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Not such a tough guy now, huh? She was about Jesse's age when I left. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Stupid rodeos, they're like a drug. Yeah. Well, that wasn't the Gauff I know. If you were still the same guy who walked out lo those many years ago, these things wouldn't bother you. Yeah. But the fact remains that you did lie to Jesse. What was I supposed to do? Really? That might have worked for the old Gauff, but the man I know aims a little higher. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) So what you gonna do, fella? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Are you serious, we've been on the road 10 minutes. Yeah, and it's gonna be three hours, I'm about to explode, hey, better safe than sorry, right? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Oh, hey. Feel better? Yeah, yeah, really good. Good, so can we get going? Well, sure. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hey. You, uh, you done good, kid. What's the point? (DOOR SLAMS) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Jesse? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Where's the stupid brush? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Jesse, what's wrong? Everything. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Can you be a little more specific? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Well, it serves you right. Jesse, this is not the end of the world, okay? There's a reason for everything, we're just not sure what it is yet. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I've been there. I was in a car accident that wrecked my whole life, but it brought me here. I wouldn't be here for you right now. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) That's what I'm talking about. Jesse? (HORSE WHINNIES) I'll finish brushing him out. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Let's have us a little talk. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Look, I, uh, I ain't exactly been square with you and all. I know why you asked me about your mom being sick, don't, don't know how you found out about her being sick and all, but I'm sorry. I should have told you. Wait, what? What? What are you talking about? Oh, now, dog gone it, Jesse, your dad didn't want you to worry. What about my mom? What's wrong with her? She, she got a little scare is all. They, they don't even know if it's cancer or nothing. A cancer scare? And nobody told me? Look, Jesse. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Jesse! (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hey, there, fella, let Riley handle this. Yeah, oughta be me. I don't think so. Sometimes you got to trust your team. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) She's gonna go out with Grace for awhile. What is it, Riley? She's pretty hurt. Well, we did lie to her. I think what you mean to say is you lied to her. She's scared. She feels like if Gauff and her mom could just get passed their past. I wouldn't even know what to say to her. Well. What? You don't really have a lot of time to figure that out. What do you mean? You might want to check your phone. She's on her way here. Right now. (HORSE WHINNIES) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) JESSE: At least I can count on you, Grace. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) It says if any man lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it will be given. It says "him," so I guess they must be talking about you. I suppose you want to pray. I was kind of thinking. You do it. Father, you are good. You seem to have a way of bringing us to you kicking and screaming. Give Gauff the words, Lord, for Jesse, for Brandy, we know You could use anyone, Lord, even Gauff, You've brought his many failures to light today. All right, that's enough. Your turn. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Lord. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) Well, all righty, then, I think Jesus can read your mind. I suggest you have a little talk with your granddaughter. (HORSE WHINNIES) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Sorry I lied. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) It's all right. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (HORSE WHINNIES) Well, sorry. I guess that's all I wanted to say. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) See, that wasn't so hard. Proves you can apologize. Which may come in handy. I'm pretty sure Brandy's here. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (HORSE WHINNIES) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Mom? Jesse? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (HORSE WHINNIES) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I thought you said they were here. Jesse, get your things, I am so sorry about this. Dad didn't even tell me. Wait, are you okay? Of course I'm okay. Grandpa told me you were sick. Grandpa? Honey, we didn't want you to worry. You could have told me the truth. Look, I'm gonna be fine, okay? I'm sorry we didn't tell you, come on, baby, it's time to get you home. But what if I don't want to? What? Jesse. I like it here, Mom. I mean, if you're okay. You are okay, right? Your mom's gonna be fine, Jesse. Look, we'll talk more on the way home, okay? Now, come on, babe, we've got to get you home. But Mom, you haven't even seen me ride. Jesse, listen to me... No, I like riding, and I like Gauff, too. And Riley, and Marianne, and Grace. Look, your father should not have brought you here. Gauff is... Gauff is a person, Mom. Careful, Jesse. No, Dad, Mom won't even try, it's not fair. Jesse. You treat your mom with respect, I mean it. Don't you dare tell her what to do. Oh, my goodness, are these Jesse's parents? Mom, Dad, this is Riley and Marianne. Nice to meet you, oh, she's been just a dear to have with us. Yeah, it's been a blast, right, Jesse? Well, we didn't mean to interrupt. Jesse, what if you show your parents what you've been learning, hmm? Well, listen, why don't you show me, and let's let Mom and Gauff catch up. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Um, look, let's go somewhere we can talk. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I was, I was hoping maybe we could, maybe, patch things up. Patch things up, really? You heard Jesse, she, she likes riding and stuff. I waited for you. Day after day, and night after night, I waited, like a fool, do you know that? And you know what I learned? I learned who you really were. And I learned what you cared about. Brandy, I'm sorry. Sorry? Don't you even dare pretend that sorry means anything now. Like, like we could just pick up where we left off, like you didn't just leave me, like I was nothing, like I was nothing, like I didn't mean a thing. Brandy... "See you soon," you said, "See you soon, Brandy," til I was, like, 10 years old. Here you come, there you go, and then you disappeared, for good. I don't want to hear how you wanted to be there, and all your stupid, lame excuses. I wasn't good at... I was 17 when I lost my mom, and all the time that she was sick, and dying, you know, where were you? I, I didn't know what to do. Poor you, I'm so sorry you were so uncomfortable. I was a child, how was I supposed to cope? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) You didn't even come to her funeral, Gauff. (HORSE WHINNIES) Who does that? I did. Just give me one good reason why I should listen to anything that you had to say. Hi, Mom! (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Brandy, there ain't no excuse. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) My priorities were... Were screwed up. I had to prove something, I guess. So how'd that work for you? (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) You needed a dad. I did not need a dad, I needed you. Oh, Brandy, I was, I was drinking, I was running around, I thought about you all the time, but I was... Selfish? Brandy. I don't deserve nothing. But you do. Maybe that means letting you take Jesse home, and, I don't know, that's that. But wait, wait. That's not what I want, Brandy. Really? Really, then what is it that you want, then? I want you. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) I want my little girl. (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) Then why haven't you done something about it? I mean, it's not like you haven't had plenty of time. I guess I was, well, I, I was ashamed. I figured you were better off without me in your life. You truly are an idiot. I'm your daughter, of course I wanted you, I wanted you to come home. I wanted you to be there for my first heartbreak. I wanted you to walk me down the aisle when I got married, I wanted you to be there when Jesse was born, I mean. I don't know how. I just don't know why I should. (HORSE WHINNIES) (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) What are you doing? Get up, come on. Brandy, I'm begging you. You don't have to do that. Yeah, I do, I'm a lousy father, Brandy. I know that, but I want to change, can you try? (SLOW PIANO MUSIC) I can try. Well, I've got to hand it to you, Brandy, I've been trying to get him down on one knee for years. It suits him. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Don't push it. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Hey, Gauff, what time does Jesse need to be out there today? Uh, I gonna keep the beginners in the indoor arena. Ah, gotcha, that arena's a little smaller. No, the indoor arena has walls. (UPBEAT MUSIC) You about ready? I don't have my riding clothes. Well, where are they? I must have forgotten them. Yeah, don't worry about it, it's just a schooling show. But I'll be disqualified. I got a feeling the judge is gonna let it fly. But what if they don't? They will. But how can you be sure? 'Cause I'm the judge. Oh. Well, don't get too happy, you still got to ride. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Be sure to keep your heels down, honey, all right, and remember... Hey. (BACKGROUND NOISE DROWNS OUT SPEAKER) (UPBEAT MUSIC) You ready? I hope so. There's a lot of people riding. All at the same time? You're new at this, aren't you? (UPBEAT MUSIC) How do you feel? I feel like the things I put my feet in might be a little bit long. They're called stir-ups. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Come on, Jesse, get him moving, get him turned around. She is crushing it. That's better. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Line up against the wall with your numbers facing the judge. Trot, please, get him moving. (BACKGROUND NOISE DROWNS OUT SPEAKER) (UPBEAT MUSIC) Posting trot, give him a good kick, Jesse, there you go, demonstrate a left lead canter. (UPBEAT MUSIC) So how's she doing? (UPBEAT MUSIC) You know, honey, I was thinking. About what? About our house. What about it? Well, it's so big, what if we thought about getting something a little smaller? Maybe a little closer? (UPBEAT MUSIC) All walk, all walk. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Riders, line up in the center of the ring with your numbers facing the judge. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Sixth place goes to rider number 129. Number 380, please. Fifth place, fourth place ribbon, third place ribbon, rider number 380, scratch that, that's rider number 364. Second place ribbon, first place ribbon to rider number 140. Thank you, riders, you may exit the arena. (UPBEAT MUSIC) You done good, kid. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Hey. Yeah? Um, you can push it now. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (HORSE WHINNIES) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hope those aren't trick candles. Becky! Couldn't miss your big day, now could I? So have at it. (GROUP APPLAUDS) Hey, Jesse, I want you to see something. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Look here. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Really? He's all yours, honey. JESSE: Thank you, thank you, thank you! Now you're gonna have to come here every day and take care of him. I guess it pays to dream big. Now, it seems to me there was something else. (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Hold it. Down on your knees, fella. (WHIMSICAL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Marianne. Yes! I didn't even ask you yet. Oh, fiddly poo, I knew where you were going with it. Ah. (LAUGHS) (SLOW ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (UPBEAT HONKY TONK MUSIC) Yeah, and it never works, either, so the point is, is maybe going to camp might be fun. I think I had a line in there. BECKY: Yeah, you do. Oh, hey, Riley. Oh. Ah! And. (IMITATES VOMITING) Well, think of all the good she did for Riley. Ah, that is not where we're at in the script, that is not at all where at the script. I didn't do great. I know, I know, I jumped. The best... I jumped, the best. Yes. Yes, okay, um. I am so sorry, Mr. Fuller, but we, we, it's just. GAUFF: Anything to eat? Oh, my God, I'm, like, totally, oh. I said that again, sorry. You're funny. (GAUFF MUMBLES) RILEY: Follow me, Kennedy, or. DIRECTOR: That's all right, it doesn't matter, you got it. Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry. Sorry, I, I, like, Oops. DIRECTOR: And that wasn't on fire. I know, dang it, I stuck it right in the... DIRECTOR: No, it's okay. No, no, no. Oh, too soon.

Excuse me, I started to, I stepped on a hose. (UPBEAT HONKY TONK MUSIC) Well, I start in the first line? Yeah, my line was ready, that was my line. Okay, we're still rolling. I thought you were...
