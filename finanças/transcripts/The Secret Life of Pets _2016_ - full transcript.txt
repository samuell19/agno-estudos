I've lived in this city all my life. I'm Max. And I'm the luckiest dog in New York, because of her. That's Katie. Katie and I... Well, we have a perfect relationship. We met a few years ago. And... Boy, let me tell you, we got along right away. You know, it was one of those relationships where... Where you just know. And get this. She was looking for a roommate, and so was I! So, I just moved in that same day! Was perfect! We've been togather ever since. Katie would do anything for me. And I'm her lawyer protector. Our love is... Our love is, how do I put this? Our love is stronger than words, Or shoes. It's me and Katie. Kaite and me. Us against the world. I wouldn't go so far as to call us soulmates, Even though, any sane person who saw us would. There's just one little problem. - Pretty much, everyday! - Come on, Max! She leaves! I'll see you tonight. Sometime I try stuff to get her to stay! Okay, sit. Spin. Speak. Okay, that's a good boy. But, it never works! Where is she going? What could she possibly be doing? I miss her so much! Wow, oh my... oh, she's back! Forgot my phone! What took so long? Why did you...? Oh, come on! Uhh! I miss her so much! Bye, Gidget! Be a good doggy. - Hey, Max! - Hey, Gidget! Any plans today? Yes. Big, big stuff today, Gidget. I got big plans.

Do you ever wonder where they go during the day? Do you know what? I just, I don't really care. Maybe that's what it's like for you, but, Katie and I have a different relationship. You know, you're a cat, so, maybe that's why. 'Cause nobody could ever love a cat the way they love a dog, I'm just saying. Maybe that's why. Whatever you need to tell yourself. - Hey, Morning, Max! - Hey, guys. What's up, Sweet Pea? Hey, Mel. Where've you been, man? Oh! Get this. Last sunday, my owner feeds me a small white pill, right? I start to feel little groggy. The next thing I know I wake up, I'm in the sky! Wait a minute, the sky? Yeah, there was suitcases everywhere. - I'm locked up in a crate! - Come on! There's suitcases in the sky? So, I pass out from fear. And when I wake up, I'm in Florida! Um, this did not happend. I will never eat a pill like that again, unless it's covered in peanut butter. Because, I mean come on, right? It's peanut butter. - Hey, guys. - Oh, hey, Norman. You still looking for your apartment? Yeah, going on three weeks, now. Is this the second or the third floor? I don't know any numbers but, you don't live here. Oh, damn it. Well, see you guys later. You know what? You can do it. Can't do it. Buddy, there you are. Did you find it? You know I did.

It's gonna be alright, Duke. It's okay. Oh, see? He likes you. Yeah. That's it, Duke. Take a look around. I know, buddy. This is a lot to take in, but... he didn't have a home.

Little guy! This place is so great. Uh-huh. By the way that is... That is one gorgeous bed. Yeah, that's okay. Maybe we could share. You know, one night you get the bed, the next night I do. - That kind of thing. - Yo, this bed is mine. You? You get an old blanket. That suits you. You're an old blanket kind of a dog. Oh, wow. You are a stubborn. Hey, I got it. I'm stubborn, too. - But, we gotta learn to get along. - Wait, what are you...? How about we can both fit in this bed, if we really trying on squeeze in there. No, wait. Perfect. This is comfy, right? No, it is not. I'm comfy. Duke is just ruining our lives. He's ruin... It's an emergency that you get rid of this dog. He stool my...

Before I answer that... I'd like to know how much you heard. So, that's how it's gonna be, huh? Oh man! You're making me angry. And when I get angry, I do this... And I don't want to do that. I need this place. And if it's gonna come down to you or me? It's gonna be me! Ahh! Morning, Max! Max! Max! What are you doing? Hi, it's me. Hi! Chloe! Chloe, Chloe! I got a bad situation. Katie brought home a new dog from the pound! She said, he's my brother. I don't want a brother. And I don't, I don't even have a bed, now. I'm sleeping on the floor, like a dog. Why would Katie do this to me? Because, she's a dog person, Max. And dog people do wierd, inexplicable things, like... they get dogs instead of cats. Okay, please don't start now, Chloe. That is not helping. Max, come on! I'm your friend, okay? And as your friend, I gotta be honest with you, I don't care about you or your problems. But, if you don't do something about this guy. And soon, your perfect little life with your dump human... is gonna be over. - Forever. - Forever? Foreve, yeah. That's what I just... Why is this mouse on my paw still? Ahh. Look, if you really want to get your turf back, you're gonna have to star acting like the alpha dog. Right, alpha dog. I can do that. - Okay! Okay! - Please, don't go. This time, really don't go. Okay, I'm running late. I gotta go. Wait, wait! No! Stay, stay for the trick. Spin. I'm doing spin. You guys be good. I'll see you later. - Wait. No, no. Wait, look. - Okay, Max. Oh! Listen, Duke. I'm not sure if you're aware, but, one of those food bowls technically, it's reserved for... I know, maybe you didn't read the names, but... That's my bowl. Um. I know, that's... Hey! I mean, I was just thinking... I don't know, maybe we could institute some ground rules. I just thought that if... Or... Or not. I, I don't, I don't need a bowl. Here again? - Rodent! - Whoa, whoa. No, no! Aah! Oh! Dah! Oh, Duke! Duke, Katie is not... Katie is gonna be upset when she sees that. Katie is... gonna flip out when she sees how you trashed her whole place. Oh, it's just, it's just one vase. Is it, Duke? Is it? Oh! That's a shame. - What are you doing? - Whoa! What am I doing? Nothing. I'm, I'm a cute little doggie. Katie knows I wouldn't do anything like this! No, no! Whoa! Uhh! This could only be the work of a dangerous stray... who hasn't lay down a foundation of trust. You're the new dog. And... Hey, Duke! Why'd you going do this for? Argh! I'm gonna... Whoa! What, bite me? Rip my face off? Perfect. Wait till Katie finds out, "Oh! Katie, thank Godness you're here." "I tried to stop him. But, he's crazy!" Uh! Huh! Now, sit! Okay! Okay! Okay! Lay down. Argh! Good boy. - Hi, Max! - Hey, Gidget! Who's your new roommate? Is it a girl dog, or a boy dog? Not that I care. It doesn't matter to me. Oh, that's nobody, Gidget. He's just visiting. Yeah, he, he's gonna be gone, soon. - Hey! What's up? - Oh, Hi! Your hat is best hat I ever seen. Hey! Uhh, excuse me, genius. You forgot my leash. Ohh! Never mind. Hey, fellas. Who's it... Woah! Hey, fellas. Who's it... Uhwah! Hey! Fellas! Huweeh! - Oh! Say, Duke? - Yes? Be a good lad and bring me a stick, won't you? It would please me to chew on a stick just now. You heard me. Fetch. Argh! Na, na, na. Not that one. That one doesn't please me. Find a really good one, Duke. Yeah, that's it. Argh. Hey, Max! Boy! Oh, wow! There are a ton of sticks over here, Max! You should come over and look at them. Yeah, I want to make sure I grab the right one. Well, that's very... That's very thoughtful. Look at all these sticks! Ha! Whoa! Help! Help! Hey, did you hear that? Butterfly! - Butterfly! Butterfly! - Oh, butterfly! Let's get it! Wha... What's... Ahh! Whoa! Ahhh! Oh! Aww! Ahh! Oh! Ahh! Ahh!

I would not fetch that. I'm old school. Ahh! Humph! Thanks a lot, Duke. I don't like to use this phrase, because it is offensive to our kind, but you're a bad dog. Katie is not gonna like this. I, I can't go to the pound! What? What's wrong with you? Well, Katie just... She just got me out of the pound. And if I go back... Back it's the end of the life for me. La pasión de la pasión. Ha!

We're just like you, guys. We hate humans. - Oh, yeah! That's right. - Hate them. Oh, man. Don't get me started on people. Am I right, Duke? Yeah, That's why we burned our collars, man! - We burned 'em to the ground. - It killed our owners. Yeah... Wait a minute. That's too far, maybe? No, they dig it. - Yes, we whacked 'em. - Yeah, that's right. Bang! Bang! With our own paws. I had a dime for every owner I kill. - Oh, yeah. - I had a dime... 'Cause I just killed the one. Whoo-ooh! Oh, you're cold-blooded. Oh man, you remind me my boy, Ricky. He died, tho. R.I.P, Ricky. You know what truth is? The struggle could use some more muscle. Alright, look. I'll tell you what. We bust the both of you outta here, but understand this, from now on you work for me. - That's fine. - Sounds like a fun challenge. Aah! Oh! Alright, guys. Let's do this. Aaah! - To the sewers! - The sewers? What are you waiting for? I'm not playin'. I said, to the sewers! Long live the revolution, suckers! I can do it. Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max!

The chain! Oh, you tried to eat me! I'm sorry! You should be sorry! You deserve to be locked up! You're a bad, bad bird! I can't help it! I was born with killer instincts! That is just no excuse! You're right, even for a predator I'm selfish. I'm selfish predator. It's no wonder I have no friends. Nobody. I... I... This is hopeless. I... Oh, don't. There is no need to cry. I'm sorry that I yalled at you before. Please take off the chain. This time I'll help you, I promise. Tiberius, this is gonna sound completely horrible, but um... I don't fully trust you. Oh! No, no, but... I guess everyone deserves a second chance, And you are just a lonely old bird, And you do have weird manners, because you live in a weird shed on a roof. So, I'll tell you what, if you find Max... I'll be your best friend! Best friend? You and me? Whoo-ooh! Awww! Whoo-ooh! Yaah! Yes! That sounds nice. Let's do this. Okay. So, what does this Max look like? Brown and white, he's a short hair, roguishly handsome, he's got a sparkle in his eye. He sounds dreamy. Ohh! You have no idea. I mean, what! Whatever! Shut up. Pfff! If my owner comes, put on the hood and pretend to be me. Okay, thank you! Ugh! The smell is disgusting... ly good! This is also great. We love it here. Huh! What's the password? Password? Look, look at me. I am your leader. The leader does not decide the password. The leader makes up the password, idiots! Everybody, I'm making up a new password, right now. The new password, is don't ask the leader for the password! Follow me. Welcome to The Underbelly, brothers. Home of the flushed pets. Brothers and sisters, as you see, I've return from the surface with two new recruits. These guys are owner killers. Yay! Hey! Hey! Settle it down! Guys! I want you to tell 'em how you did it. Go ahead, tell 'em the whole story about how you took out your owner. Don't leave out nothing. We love gory detail here. - Oh yeah! - Tell us! - Right. - So, tell 'em, Max. Okay, okay. So... - I was like... - Well, we were like... - Take that, stupid owner. - Yeah. So, that's... That who you're dealing with. Hey, that's story bored me to death. Boring! Give us detail. Okay. Max?

You can't hurt someone with a spoon. You scoop with a spoon. How many people wanna know how to kill somebody with a spoon? - I do! - Oh yeah! Okay. Well, we use a spoon... Hit the button on this machine... - Right, right. - On the counter. - And it's go those... - The... You know... - Those blades. - It's got blades! Was it a blender? Whaoh! You blending somebody?

You know who's like this? Ricky! Rest in peace. Ricky was the only soldier I had... that was ready to kill humans on sight. Everybody else need a pet talk. Not these two brothers. Whoa-hoo! Yay! See, all of us have suffered at the hands of man. I mean, take me for instance. I was a magician's rabbit for kids parties. But then, bunny tricks went out of style. So, what did my owner do? My owner went and left magic behind, And made me disappear... From his life! Uh-huh. I lived in a tattoo parlor. The trainees used to practice on me. Until they ran outta space! I mean, yes. Human say they love us, But then, they turn around and throw us out like garbage. Ain't that right, Seamonkeys? Hey! It's not our fault we don't look like the ad. Yeah. Alright, you guys are joining The Brotherhood. It's initiation time. - What? - I'm sorry, what time? Summon the Viper! Is this Viper poisonous? Because I should warning you I'm very allergic to poison! Ouch! Ah! Alright, show her. Huh! Max's collar! Where is he? Wha... Wha... What happened to him? Oi, I ain't say nothing. You're gonna tell us where Max is, and you're gonna tell us now! Is this supposed to scare me? I'm a cat. - I'll end on my feet. - Does it always happen? 'Cause your head looks like it's taken a lot of landings. Do you want me to catch you? 'Cause I'll catch you this way, and let you look like a waffle. Okay, he's too stupid to talk and too ugly to eat. Aahhh! I'm done playing nice! Where is Max?! - Oh! - Tell me! What? Aw! I ju... I can't... Aww! Let me finish... Aww! Help me! Don't look at him, look at me! Nobody can help you! Where is Max?! Okay! Okay! He's in the sewers. He got taken. Please, have mercy! Adorable buffy dog. Huh! Snake bite! Snake bite! Snake bite!

Hey, here's the thing, tho. - I mean, It's... - Tiny dog. Can I call you, tiny dog? It fits you. Let's admit that. Mate, look. Between you and the fat dog? I like you the best. Oh, thank you. Tiny dog is gonna fo first. Everybody, T.D is going first. No, no, no! Tiny dog does not wannago first, take the fat dog. Aww! Aahh! - No, no, no! Stop! - Snake bite! Snake bite! Snake bite! Snake bite! Snake bite! Snake bite! No, no, no, no! What are you doing, initiating a couple of domestics? Domestics? Yeah, we just dumped those two in the alley, Slashed two of their collars. No, no, no. That.. That's not true. You said, you burned your collars. Well, burned, lost, had 'em stolen by a cat. It's all just word. Really? Isn't it? You don't deserve to be marked by a Viper. - Oh, wow! - We'll just show ourselves out. You deserve to be eaten by the Viper. Het those leash lovers! Aahhh! Hold on! Go get 'em, Duke! Whoa! Uhh. Fellas, that was an accident. You squished the sacred Viper? He's a flapjack! Oh, Viper. Viper, you in a better place. You and Ricky. You ain't never did nothing to nobody. Well, you bit a lot of people, Viper. So technically, you might actually deserve this. This might be something that was long overdue. But... It shouldn't came like this. Not on my watch. Get 'em! Whoah! Come on! Aw! Wait on, Duke! We're sorry. Can this be over, now? We've got a problem! We have so many problems. Which one do you mean it, this moment? Stop running, dummies! Stop it, right there! - Hold your breathe! - Hold my breathe? This is my least favorite party this holding so far. Friends. I'm afraid that I have some terrible news. The squirrels are gonna take over the world! I knew it! I always said, squirrels are little shifty, little guys. No! We're not doing this squirrel thing, right now. That's not... No! Max is missing! He's out there, somewhere. Lost, scared, so, so handsome. We've got to find him and bring him home! But, the outside world is loud and scary... Whoa! Is that a hawk? This is my friend, Tiberius. He's going to help us. He's not going to eat us. We've already been over it. Come on, Gidget. We go out there without a leash? We'll get caught by a net. Or something worse. Yeah, like a hawk! We're wasting time! Max needs us! Come on, girl. Max doesn't even know you're alive. Well, I don't care. I love him, I love him with all my heart. And, I'm gonna go look for Max no matter who's with me. So... Who's with me? Alright. Fine, fine. Oh, come on, guys. I can't believe you. When I got my claws caught in the curtains, Who pulled me down? Max, did! Buddy, Mile! When you were fixed, Who told you to sit the comfortable way? - Max, did. - Max, did! Max, did! He did it! And, when that random cat tried to eat Sweet Pea, Who saved him? It wasn't a random cat, it was you! The identity of the random cat is not the point, We're talking about who saved him? Max, did! We gotta sive him. We gotta go save Max! Yeah! Let's go save Max! Uhh... Which one is Max, again? - Hmmm. - Tiberius! No! Bad, bad bird! Nice little guy. Nice little guy. I like this, bird. Crazy bird. Aahhh! Ohh! Come on, we gotta get to shore. I only do the doggie paddle. And I don't know it well. Swim, tiny dog. Swim! Aww! Duke! Help! Max, grab the ring! I ca... I can't! Keep it up, Max! You're doing... Well, you're not... You're not doing great. But, you're not drowning, and that's something. Ah! Aww! You're almost there! Whoah! Huh! Ahh! Uh! - Thanks, Duke. - No problem. Finally, we're going home. Uh... Isn't home that way? Uhh! Seriously? They're going to Brooklyn. They say, everyone's going to Brooklyn these days. It's makin' a real comeback. I'm not talking about hipster real estate trends. I'm talking about vengeance, Tattoo! Death is coming to Brooklyn. And it's got buck teeth, and a cottontail! Let's go. Weee! - Hey, how are you? - Hi, how are you? Enchanté. Chuck! Chuck! Chuck! Chuck! Chuck! Chuck! Chuck! Yay!! What is this creepy joint? This is Pops place. His owner is never home so, it's kind of a hotspot. Pops knows everyone in this city. If he agrees to help us. Max is as good as found. - Cool! - Oh, fabulous. - Tell me you got that. - Oh, have yes I did. - What's up, Peanut? - Hey, Buddy. - You see Pops around here? - Yeah, he's over there. Hey, Pops. - Mushroom and sweet potatos. - Pops! Owee! Guys! Who's that? What? Oh! Hey, Buddy. How you've been, old timer? Paralysed. Great. Listen mr. Pops. Our friend Max was taken. Last we heard, he was lost in the sewers. Buddy said that maybe you could help us? No, I do know a guy in the sewers, but... I... I don't go out anymore. Uh. What a waste of time. Who said that? Oh! I said it. By the way, I meant no offence. I just... Have you seen yourself? Welldy, well, well, well. Looky what we apparently have here! Me see would like to have a look see. Myron, brows! Oh, no. Oh, yes. Me like what me see. Well, what me can see, it's only an an attractive blur. Little lady, this is my city. I'll find your friend. Alright, party is over. Myron, vacuum! So, where are you from, my fuzzy angel? Dude, I'm a cat. Well, nobody is perfect. I'm so hungry. Oh man, would you look at that sandwich! Alright, time to work the gift. No, no, no! Argh! Okay. This... This... This will be fine. We're fine. We can find our way home. We're descended from the mighty wolf. We've raw primal instincts... that are mere moments away from kicking in... And leading us home. I can not wait! Here it comes... - Anything? - No. Wait! Aw! I... Argh! No! I don't know, Duke. Maybe the legend of dogs coming from wolves is just wrong. I mean like, maybe one puppy asks his mom, "Where did we come from?" and the mom said, "Woof"! And the kid was like, "Oh, wolves"! And she's like, "Yeah, fine". - Sausage! - Huh? Do you smell that? - Oh, man. It is! - Sausage! Well then, what are we waiting for? We're coming for you, baby! Lower the ramp, dummy! Who are they? This is Puffball, Squashface, Wiener Dog, Yellow Bird, Eagle Eye, Guinea Pig Joe! And of course my girlfriend, Ronda! Ah! 100% percent wrong. Good enough. Come on, let's go! Move it or lose it. Every bird instinct I have says, "Don't follow a dog on wheels". Um... Mr. Pops. Sir... Shouldn't we be heading to the sewers? Now, if we take the human road, getting there is gonna take days. You may have lot of time, but for me, every breath is a cliffhanger! So, we gotta take the secret route. Okay! The secret route was death. - Well, that's that, I guess. - Come on! Get down here. Sweet Pea. Keep moving. Oh, no! Stop it! Look away! Come on, I don't have all day. Come on, slowpokes. What is that smell? It's poo-poo with a dash of caca. Scent is getting stronger. Aww! Oh, man! Duke, let's eat! Oh, yes! Oh, smells so good! Oh, yeah! - Sausages! - Sausages! Come on, boys! Holy Schnitzel! "We go together,." "Like rama lamma lamma ka dinga da dinga dong."

It's all laid out, right here! Boss. I can't tell thogh what it is. Well, you have to really look at it to understand it. Like, that's you guys right here. And... See, that's Brooklyn. That's where we go get 'em dogs. Bam! Bam! That ball of fluff's got a screw loose. Let's get at 'em. But, you get it. You see what I'm sayin'. Bottom line is, I'm coming right to you, Tiny Dog. And that big fat brown dog, he gonna get it, too. Tiny Dog? There're lots of tiny dogs in the city! I mean, you're a tiny dog, okay? So, let's just go. He also said, big fat brown dog. Like Max's new roommate. Not necessarily. Whoo! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! You are gonna get it! Ahh! That's kinda hard to hard to dispute. Hey! You stay away from... Wait, what? You know, Tiny Dog? He's my friend! And some might say my boyfriend! Uhh... Nobody says that. I can't beleive you know, Tiny Dog. Oh man, that's cool! It's such a small world. That's the funny thing about it. - Get 'em! - Scatter! Not good. See you guys, later. Oh my God! Everybody, run! Derick, you idiot! Did they all get away? Hewo! That was a close one. Oh, nuts! Yes! We got one. Oh, good for you, guys! - Yay! - Ya-hey! Oh yes, Tiny Dog! We got your friend! Advantage me! Uh-oh! Just ignore what just happend, okay? Yes! You know what? I mean, this maybe the sausage talking... But, you're okay. Right back at you, man! You know, when I met you I was all like... "Oh! I don't know if I like him". But, now that I know you, I'm like... "I like him". You know, I saw this place. From the outside. Many times! And I know what treasures are weighted within these walls. I would've broke down that door a long time ago, I tell you. What are you talking about? My old owner and I used to live arond here. Duke! Man, wait! Did you used to have an owner? Well, It was... It was a long time ago. I don't wanna talk about it. Yes, you do. Come on. I don't know. But, you know what? He was so cool. Yeah? Yeah. He was the best. Man, we had fun! We play fetch! We go for walks. We take naps. We're both big nappers. I got out one night, chasing a butterfly or a car. By the time, I'd caught up with it and ate it! Probably a butterfly, then. I realized I was so far away from my home. I couldn't find it. Few days later, I was picked up by animal control. I had a great thing going, but... I had it go and mess it up. Duke, we gotta go to your house! Na! You know, your owner is gonna relieved! Really? Yeah, but... But, he never came for me. Maybe he... Maybe he didn't like me. Hey, of course he liked you. He was your owner! I mean, he's probably worried sick. I don't know. Well, I do know and we're going. Your owner is gonna freak. I'm freaking out just thinking about it! Okay. Let's do it. Here they are. Alright, doggie, come on. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Where you think you're going? Come back here, you dogs! Aahhh! That rabbit. He has crazy eyes. There ain't no curing was wrong with that thing! Gidget, here's an idea, Maybe there's a dog in the neighborhood that looks like Max. Start hanging out with him, after a while you'll think it's him, you'll be done. We're not just giving up! We're dedicated, we're loyal, We're easly the greatest pet ever, We're dogs! - Cat. - Hawk. Well, Congratulations, today you're dogs whether you like it or not. Sweet! Now, let's find Max before that rabbit does. Right! We're dogs! Yep! They were here. Excellent. We're closing in. This is a groundbreaking evil behavior, people. Groundbreaking. Light pop just now from my brain. The bunny has an idea. Okay. So, how do I look? You look great. How do I smell? Like a dog, Duke. Relax, man. There it is! Well, go on up. Go scratch that door. Remember that sausage factory? That was fun, huh? Are you stalling? No, why do you think that? Let's have a walk talk about why you think I'm stalling. Duke, you have nothing to be nervous about.
