Did you do that? Ha. No, I do better work... We'll start again. Did you do that? - Yeah. - Can't hear you. - Yeah, I did it. - Spoony... explain it, make it pretty, or clean it up. Well, ma... maybe I can explain it. Go ahead. It's a social... protest. That's very '60s, Spoony. Look, don't you jokers ever learn? You don't believe in free speech? No. We want clean lockers. Okay, far out. I'll clean it off. No good, Spoony. Excuse me. Can you direct me to... Can't you see he's busy? Well, I am sorry. I thought you were between rounds. - You're new here. - Yeah. You've got a lot of learning to do. Oh, great. You offering to help? Sure, if you want. Fine, I'm looking for the... Trouble. If you don't cut the shit. Now get lost. Will you help me out? Hey, man, don't ask me. Mind your own business? Spoony, get some soap. Yeah, all right, I'll get some soap. Excuse me. Can you tell me where the student lounge is? Hey, do you know where the... You know where the stu... You know where the student lounge... Lost? Yes. This place is a maze. You'll get used to it. - I hope so. I'm new here. - I know. - Morning, Theresa. - Hi. Theresa. That's a very nice name. And a very nice smile. What are you looking for? Right now I'd settle for the student lounge. That's easy. It's just down the hall. Okay. Thanks. I'll see you again? It's a small school. - David. - Hey, Mark. I was beginning to think you wouldn't make it. Well, I had a little trouble finding the place. That's the last trouble you'll ever have here. From now on, we take care of you. - We? - Let me introduce you to my buddies. This is Bruce, Paul, and Craig. We've met. Welcome. Mark's told us a lot about you. Well, you haven't changed a bit. No. Well, it's been a long time, though. You two must have a lot of catching up to do. Yeah, for sure. Come on, I'll show you around. We'll talk some. You won't believe it, man. This place is a fuckin' country club. You're gonna think of that place we used to go to as nothing but a bad dream. Gotta be able to change your whole style here. Well, why would I wanna do that? Because it's time you just laid back and enjoyed things. And this is the place. I'll see to that. My guardian angel? Look, David, I owe you. And now I can do something about it. You're riding pretty high here. Is that it? - You haven't seen the best yet. - No? - You will after school. - What's that? - A girl. - A girl? - Serious thing? - I think so. - Hey, man, that's great. - Yeah, it is, but don't worry. She'll fix you up with something really nice. Hey, now, I'll take care of myself. As a matter of fact, there's this girl I just saw... Look, you gotta drop that loner shit. This is a new place. Enjoy it. - Hey, same old car? - Yep. Yep, and it still runs great. Hey, what about you? Well, if it's not too cold, I can still turn it over. No, come on, I mean running. You still into it? Yeah. Yeah, every day. - Hey, man, tell me who that... - Hey, wait a minute. Here she comes. This is my girl. Theresa, I want you to meet an old friend of mine, David. - We've met. - Man, you get around. He was lost. Yeah, Theresa was nice enough to help me out. Talk about coincidence. - Guess it's a small school. - That's what I told him. What's happening? Oh, nothing yet. I thought we'd all do something with David. Sure. Hey, look, I'm... I'm gonna go. I'll talk to you later. These your wheels? Yeah. I like it. It's funky. Yeah, but you parked on the wrong side of the lot. How's that? Park over here, you won't get your car scratched. We park over here. Choice spot. Yeah, if you like, we'll kick one of these turkeys out and make room for you. Don't bother. The walk won't hurt. Hey, David'll run it. Hell, he's... he's a sprinter. That's something? Craig's a diver. Oh, yeah? Where do you work out? Right here. His old man built the school an Olympic pool. That's pretty convenient. Well, let's do something. - Sure, what? - Surfing? No, I'm tired of that. - Ever do any hang gliding? - No. It's a rush. It's flirtation with death. Nothing like it. Anyone feel up to it? Listen, by the time we get our gliders and shit, it's gonna be too late anyway. I guess so. Shit. There he goes again. Who's that? Some creep named Rodney. That guy can be a real pain in the ass. - Sure is a hell of a car. - It's disgusting. Makes me sick even to park in the same parking lot. - Come on, let's do something. - Sure. Think of something. Why don't we just all drive around, show David the place? Okay. Paul, we'll take your van. Hey, let's get that garbage can. Hey, Rodney. Where's the fire? Come on, fellas. Leave me alone. When's the last time this thing was inspected? Looks to me like an awfully hazardous vehicle. I wouldn't drive this car in a million years. We'd better check it out. First we better check the brakes. Right. Check brakes, no good. Can someone lend me a seatbelt? - How about reverse? - Good idea. Go, baby! Reverse works, but there seems to be a little problem with the steering. Hey, what do you think, Craig? - I think it needs an overhaul. - Maybe a lube job. Trip to the graveyard. Hey, come on, man. Let's go. - You're worried about something. - I guess. - Is it about your friend David? - Why do you say that? I don't know. It's just a feeling. Am I right? Yeah, you're right. I hope he fits in. Why wouldn't he? What's he like? When I first met him, he helped me out in a jam without even knowing me. He's like that. There aren't that many people left like that. Maybe. Hey, come on. You wanna go down to our spot on the beach? It's kinda cold out. - Would you rather go home? - If you don't mind. Whatever you want. That new guy, he's kinda cute. Who is he? A friend of... of Mark's. And Bruce's. I don't know. He's probably got a few days left. I better move fast. Yeah, before Bruce turns him into a scared rabbit. You know, it's possible to ignore Bruce. I did. A little help from Mark? They get to everyone sooner or later. Not you, lard ass. Keep going. Oscar! See, Oscar, I knew you could do it. Yeah! Hey, Oscar! Oscar! Hey, David, wait up. David? Why'd you run out? I felt like a shower. Hey, you really missed something, man. You know that fat kid, Oscar? Climbed two feet higher than he ever has before. Guess all he needed was a little friendly persuasion. - A little friendly persuasion? - Hey, Oscar. Congratulations. Doesn't it feel good to get into shape? Don't forget, without physical exercise, you get high blood pressure. Fat builds around the heart. You don't wanna die at 40, do ya, Oscar? David... look, I know what you're thinking, but you've gotta understand... You've changed, man. Yeah, sure I have. And you should too. Hey, you like fighting people every day like we used to? You never complained when they were hitting on you. Yeah, but they're not hitting on me here. And they're not hitting on you, either. David, please don't push it. Hey. I thought it'd be nice if the three of us did something this afternoon. Like what? I don't know. Take a drive? Go to the beach? Anything. I don't think so, man. I think I'll just, head on home. Hey, don't be stupid. It's a beautiful day. Well, I'm not sure I'm in the mood either. In the mood for what? Hey, what's the matter with her? Mark, something's come up. We've got to talk. Sure. What? Not here. The van. Wait here. I'll be right back. Hi. Hello again. Looks like Bruce still doesn't care for you. Is that bad? It could mean good things about you. Or bad things in store for you. You don't like those guys? The little league Gestapo? Who does? Why do people take it? Ask them. I will. Maybe you'll start something. Maybe. But I wouldn't wanna do anything that hurts Mark. He really cares about you. He's a friend. We've been together for a long time. Yeah, that's great. We really get along. I can see that. I think your pal David means trouble. What do you mean? He's a great guy. I know he's your friend. That's right. He's my friend. But he seems to be looking for a fight. And we'll give it to him. He's just aloof. That's his nature. It's also his nature to butt in where he shouldn't from the day he arrived. He just doesn't understand how this place works yet. I'll talk to him. It'll all work out. I hope so. Okay! Everybody out! Hey, that doesn't mean us. Hey, Spoony, out! Hey, man, they don't own that pool, you know. Oh, man. You again. Why do you keep hassling me? Me hassle you? Well, what about those guys? Look, I try and keep a low profile, okay? What the hell's the matter with all of you? You like this place the way they run it? No way. Sometimes I even try and express it. Like writing on walls? You saw what I got for that. Look, man, to sin around here is a real bummer. Hey, Rodney. Rodney, don't you want a lift? I, I changed my mind. Decided a walk'd do me good. Yeah, well, that's fine, pal, but you're headed in the wrong direction. School's out that way. Come on, hop in. You hitchhike to school every day? Lately. You have trouble getting rides? Sometimes. Yeah, but, shit, I don't mind the walk. More peaceful than my car was. How's that? All that backfiring, pistons rattling, radiator overheating. Made me a nervous wreck. I hated that old jalopy. You sound like we did you a favor. Not really. I'll never be able to afford another one. Sure, you can pick one up for a couple hundred bucks. Yeah. But where do I get a couple hundred bucks? Well, maybe we can fix up that old jalopy of yours? Get it running again. I'd be glad to take a crack at it. Hey, that's solid. Yeah, we can haul it over to my house. I've got a garage there. Or we can work on it at your place. Nah, my pa, he doesn't like strangers coming around. Says it upsets the chickens. Morning, Rodney. Morning, Mary and Jane. - Morning. - Hi, Theresa. What is this, "be kind to losers" day? I hate those two. Couple of bulldykes. All they need is a good fuck. - Damn straight. - I wouldn't mind. They're not bad lookin'. Hey, Arthur. Arthur! Jerk's hearing aid must be off. Yes, gentlemen. May I be of some assistance? Yeah, I'm returning a book. Certainly. I'm afraid it's overdue. That would be 20 cents. You've got to be kidding. Please understand, I didn't devise the school's archaic policy toward overdue material, and I gain no personal financial reward from collecting the requisite funds, but... Of course, I'm only a minor functionary. A volunteer assistant. If you'd rather discuss it with the librarian, she'll be here tomorrow. And I'm confident, Arthur, that you'll have the place spic and span by the time she gets here. Yeah, I was surprised to see your friends coming out of the library. Well, they're not morons. They do read a book occasionally. Yeah, looks like they're voracious readers. Hey, what are you doing? I'm gonna give the poor guy a hand and help clean up your friends' mess. What the fuck are you trying to do? I had you all set up here. No hassles, no fights. Easy. And you're blowing it. For me too. - You already blew it, man. - Yeah? How. By starting to think that you're more than that poor guy. David, I'm telling you for your own good, those guys, they're already getting edgy about the way you've been acting. You're playing with fire. You tell them the same thing. What happened? Looks like a.6 on the Richter scale. Yes, I'm afraid I provoked the wrath of the gods. What are you gonna do about it? Seems to me, gazing about, that I've done quite enough for one day. Don't you people ever fight back? That's a very dangerous and ill-conceived notion, my friend. The walls have ears. Now, if you'll excuse me. Well, I was gonna give you a hand. No need. It's best if we each lose our own battles. You know you're breaking a long school tradition. I sure hope so. Got any plans? Yeah, let's take care of these two. What do you mean? You know, what Bruce was talking about. I pass. What's the matter, you scared? They won't do nothin'. Look, I'm just not interested, all right? Don't you guys know? He saves it all for Theresa. Yeah, that's right. Why should I waste my time on them? Hey, man, it's not a question of scoring. We can all do better. We should just do it to teach them something. Well, it's your show, professor. I got my own homework to do. What the hell, Bruce. We don't need him. Might be a new kick. Well, don't just stand there talking about it. Do it. - What do you feel like doing? - Nothing. Hey, what's the matter with you? Why? Nothing's the matter with me. You've been acting really strange lately. Did I do anything? No, you've been your same old self. Come on. This isn't a good place to talk. Stop it! - Why are you clutching me? Let me go. - Get in the car. We've got some things to talk about. I don't wanna drive. Well, so we'll sit in the car. Jesus. Look, I just wanna go home. Go ahead. Now, what am I supposed to do? You've got other friends, Mark. Yeah, but right now I'd rather be with you. Look, I'm just gonna go home. Go ahead. Or maybe you'd rather be with your girlfriends, Mary and Jane. Now what's that supposed to mean? Just that they're not such snobs. Right now they're partying with Bruce and those guys. So that's your idea of a good fuck, Bruce? You get the hell out of here! No. I'm waiting for Mary and Jane. How long will this take? Bruce, get rid of her. Oh, what's wrong, Craig? You can't get it up for an audience? He was having trouble before you came in. Let go of me. Let go of me right now. If it wasn't for Mark... All right, let's go. - What about these two? - Forget 'em! You think Theresa went to get someone? She wouldn't dare. - Who is it? - Hey, open up. It's Mark. Hey, can I give you a lift home or something? No, thanks. We'll manage. Come on. Why are you following me? I was worried about you. What do you want? An applause for your Sir Lancelot act? Hey, come on. You know, for a while there, I couldn't tell the difference between you and Bruce or Craig and Jane. Look, I'm sorry. That's the only way I know. That's the way I am. I meant well. I know. Come on. Let's go for a ride. Go to the beach and take a walk. Cool off some. As far as I'm concerned, this is it. Just keep your hands on the wheel. He's right. If it ever gets out that he took us... It won't. We'll find him before that. He won't have a damn thing to brag about. Just forget about what I said before. I don't have any right to criticize you. No. No, if I'm wrong, you tell me. No, at least you did something. I've chosen to hide behind Mark. You could have done the same thing too, but you didn't. Maybe I can learn something from you. - Don't. - Why? Well, if I just jump in without thinking and start swinging, I can really blow it. I don't know. The anger just builds up inside and takes over. What you need is some kind of a release for all your anger. I have a release. I run. That David's Jeep? Yeah. - He's had it. - You're not being smart. - What? - I'm disappointed in you, man. David's left must have rattled your brain. All right, he started a fight, okay? That's reason enough to waste him, except he beat you. All of you. And if you were thinking straight, man, you'd realize he's a good guy to have with us, not against us. Bullshit. You're just trying to protect your stinkin' pal. He's got a point. Okay, Mark. Talk to him. He's got one more chance to straighten out. If not, he's finished. David! David! David! Well? I talked to him. I couldn't get anywhere, all right? - Okay, let's get him. - No! Not now. I wanna be left out of it. He was my friend. What the hell is that? Looks like our friend David's making one of them modern sculptures. Wait a minute. I recognize it. One of our masterpieces. That's right, "Reflections of Rodney." David boy's restoring it. - Artist. - Artist. He's not the artist. He's just trying to steal our concept. Why else would he be hiding? I don't know. And to think we came all the way over here just to have him beat us up again. Come on, David. Don't disappoint us. I'm afraid I have to. I've got work to do. I said get out of there. Go to hell. You're not talking to one of your stooges. Fuck it. I'll get you out. He wouldn't see me. I told you, I tried five times. Why won't he see anyone? Who knows? Shame. Anger. It was an accident. David told them no one else was even there. Yeah, that's what he told them. But you don't believe it? Sure. I believe it. He's a good friend of yours, Mark. The best. There was a moment before the accident. We were on the beach. Talking and feeling close. We went skinny dipping. I wanted to make love, and I think he did too, but he wouldn't... because of you. There's Theresa, and she's with Mark. That's okay. Let's ask her anyway. Hey, Theresa, were you able to see David? - How is he? - They said he was doing well. You mean you didn't see him? They said he'd be out in about a week. Will he be coming back to school? I suppose so. Is it a permanent injury? Must be. It was my car. Cast-iron Ford's really heavy. Oh, yeah, heavy. Bruce and the guys are coming. Hi, Bruce. Hi, Craig. Hi, Paul. How did you find out he's coming back today? Mark told me. It's all for the good. One look, and they'll stop seeing this David as a phantom hero and just see him as a cripple. - I wonder if he's learned his lesson. - You bet he has. He was even too scared to tell 'em we were there. Maybe he'd be willing to join us. That's why he kept his mouth shut. Who wants him? The guy's swashbuckling days are over. - Hello, David. - Hello, Theresa. - How are you feeling? - All right. And you? I'm okay. Hey, David, it's great to have you back, man. We've been waiting for you all morning. Well, it takes me a little longer to get around than it used to. David. Glad to see you're okay. I want to thank you for not... implicating us. Ratting on people isn't my style. Right. One friend dead, another one crippled. I don't know who's worse off, David or Bruce. David's alive. So what? We're all gonna die. Shit! Those goddamn idiots. What the hell happened to the lights? Oh, well. Who the fuck needs them? It's terrible. Just terrible. And I hate to be the one to show you, but I knew you'd want to see it for yourselves. Have any of you vultures been able to tear yourselves away long enough to report this? I sent Oscar for the principal. I just happened to be walking through, and when I saw what was in there, I damn near jumped out of my skin. Is that right? Why, if I hadn't happened to come along, he could be laying there for hours, for days. Rather improbable. Lights don't work. I guess he didn't see the pool was empty. Well, Craig, like they say, everything that goes around, comes around. To think that just yesterday he was so full of life. Hey, would you... Forget it, man! Just get out of here. One accident? Groovy, it's an accident. But two? It's something else. What? Murder? No, part of a cosmic pattern. So what the hell is going on? I mean, first Bruce, then Craig. Listen, I'm scared, all right? I mean, the two of us, we're gonna have to work even harder to keep everybody in line? Just finding that body, first the principal wants to talk to me. Nice guy, by the way. And then the police. - The pigs? - Yeah. Well, I guess this accident's a big thing. But I didn't tell 'em anything. Commendable. But I wasn't aware you knew anything. Anyhow, as I was saying, you know, three, it's a really mystical number. The Devil's pitchfork. I agree there'll be more accidents, but I feel the cause will be a bit less metaphysical. That's not metaphysics, dummy. Well, anyhow, we're still gonna have another calamity. Yeah, and I hope it gets another one of those assholes. - Me too. - Yeah. There's definitely a message in all these accidents. - What's that? - The higher you feel, the deeper you fall. Okay, scatter. I said break it up! It's no good, Paul. Come on, man. Let it lay. Nice going, David. Yeah. This is my pal. Yeah, that's real boss, man. You got 'em running. Hey, we should have done this a long time ago. Yeah, we really showed 'em, didn't we? Right. Yeah, Harvey, you really showed 'em. I think so. Okay, so why did you drag me away? It was him. He did it. He must have. Everything started happening the minute he came around here. Come on. Calm down. What are you gonna do? Sit around here and die? Let these creeps walk all over us? They are all out to get us. Look, maybe it's time we kept a low profile, okay? Getting hysterical isn't gonna do anything. Why don't we go to the beach after school? Try and get our minds off it. - I've been waiting for you. - Why? I want to talk to you, and I figured the only way was to lay an ambush. I haven't got time right now, really. What's wrong? Have I done something? - No. - Well, you make me feel terrible. I'm sorry. Damn it, what is wrong with you? I thought you lost your leg, not your tongue. Just forget about me. What was that all about? He still won't talk to me. He's doing things his own way. Well, why doesn't it include us? I'm afraid it will. - What do you mean? - Nothing. Come on. It's a beautiful day. Let's not waste it. How about the beach? You're right, I'm feeling a lot better. Hey, you feeling better? Starting to unwind? No, I keep thinking about sharks. Look, why don't you just relax and enjoy the sun? Why don't you go to hell? Hey, I'm the last friend you got left. Well, who needs you? I mean, let's face it. You've turned into a real pussy lately. Pretty soon you'll be hanging around with Arthur and Rodney, trying to get me. But I'm telling you, man, I am not gonna be as easy as Bruce and Craig. I'll be waiting for you. Mark, where's Paul? All over the place. He just completely flipped out. You mean you let him go off by himself? Well, what do you expect me to do? I mean, he didn't want me with him. So what? What kind of a friend are you? Look, if he's in trouble, you should be with him. Go after him. And you're sure you'll be all right here by yourself? I'm sure. Just go. All right, I'll see you in a minute. Paul! Mark! Help! Help! David! David. Yeah. I knew it. I thought I knew with Bruce and the others. I was sure. I knew it was you. And you didn't do anything? Damn it, I couldn't. I owed you, man. And then I repaid you with that? I can't fight you. Shove your pity, man. It's not gonna save you. I know that. But please, man, do it. Do it now. Just get it over with. Go to hell. I'm not a mercy killer. I'll choose when and how. I only hope you're man enough to struggle. What took you so long? There's been an accident. Paul. He's dead? Yeah. - How? - What do you think? The same. He must have been putting away his surfboard. The van started to roll. He was trapped inside. Hi. How's it going? - Hi. - Hello. Hello. Dig it, it's gonna take some time. I mean, all that conditioning's gotta take a while to wear off. But, as far as I can tell, things are changing already. People are talking. That's a start. Yeah, maybe soon they'll start talking about real things. Questioning their values a little. Goddamn math problem won't come out. What's the trouble? I don't know what they're talking about. Here, let me look at it. I'm supposed to know everything. Oh, that one. - Come on, Oscar! - Go, Oscar! - All right, Oscar! - Yeah, you're getting there. One of these days, that man's gonna be physically fit. What slop. You think that's funny? Didn't take long for the natives to become restless. David, we saved a seat for ya. Thanks, anyway, but I prefer the corner. I'm ashamed of this whole school. What a senseless, mindless display. Oh, fuck off, Arthur. Jesus Christ. This is a goddamn good thing that's happening. It's a form of liberation. - Hey, by wasting food? - Yeah, fuckin' A. All you spoiled rich brats are the same. Hey! You're lucky I like you, Rodney. David? David? I have to talk to you. What is it? It's late. David, I've never understood why you wouldn't have anything to do with me since your accident. And I haven't pushed it. But right now I need your help. It's about Mark. Well, I can't do anything. I can't talk to him. I don't want you to talk to him. I just don't want you to kill him. - What did he tell you? - Nothing. But I'm not so stupid. He's already dead, David. There's no point in killing him. You'd just be killing me. Theresa... nothing's gonna happen to you. Or to Mark. Can I tell him that? Yeah, you can tell him that. Arthur. Arthur. What now? I... I thought I'd take out these books, and... and I want to know what you think of 'em. Fine. Interesting. Very poor choice. Shallow. Very shallow. Arthur. Oh, David. Glad you could spare a minute. - I've been thinking. - Really? Listen. Suddenly this school is rife with opportunity. Which the two of us can take advantage of. For instance? It's obvious. These students crave an alternative to Bruce's brute force. We can supply it. What can we supply? Leadership. Direction. Why, with my brains and your influence, we can turn this into a place where mind and spirit are more important than brawn. You don't believe it's possible. Of course not. That's your whole problem. You think of yourself as a helpless cripple, always keeping to yourself, never taking command. The same was true for me, but I've learned something you haven't. I've learned that a physical disability needn't be debilitating. A weakness of the body can be compensated for by the mind. And a person can become even more powerful. Come on, Oscar. Let me pass by. Hey, David. David. We've been wanting to rap with you. Can you dig what was really happening at the cafeteria, man? Maybe. You tell me. Well, it's just a beginning, but those kids are really crying for change. They're ready to tear this whole place down. They need leadership. People to show 'em the way. And you have a lot of influence. We could all join up. They'd have to listen and accept it. There'll be some holdouts like Arthur. But we'd be strong enough to handle 'em. They couldn't stop us. We'd kill 'em. Hey, Rodney. Where'd you get the fancy wheels? Nice? Come on, buddy, I'll take you for a spin. Maybe later? What about this car? Oh, I bought it on time. Bruce's parents. Got a real good deal, too. They said it kinda depressed them having it around. Reminded them of Bruce. Great little machine? And I take good care of it, too. Try and park as far away from those other buggies as I can so it won't get dented or scratched. You know, it's a disgrace just having to park in the same lot with these other buggies. So you've become one of the privileged people. Sure. But there's a difference. I deserve it. I had to work for it. Didn't come on no silver platter. - I guess that's true. - You bet. Say, pal, I've been meaning to talk to you. You too. Nothing. Yeah, well, I figure if we two got together, we can waste all those rich snobs and eggheads. What do you have in mind? Little turning of the tables. Knock 'em down a peg or two. - I don't know, Rodney. - Sure, you don't. 'Cause you're not really ordinary folk. I mean, you weren't born to it. But you got your chance. Just watch the way I operate. This is as good a place to start as any. The asshole. Used to be a real big shot? See how you like driving a jalopy. - Hi, David. - Hello, Harvey. New car? - Yeah, what of it? - Degenerate Detroit gas guzzler. Now, who asked you? Goddamn hippy freak. - Oh, I think it's a neat car. - Buzz off. What snobs those guys are. They've no reason to be. They've all demonstrated their intelligence is every bit as low as yours. Watch it! Hey, you guys are through pushing us around, okay? Get out of here. Hey, dig it. The dethroned king. No doubt on his way to Elba. Taken any joyrides lately, Your Majesty? Still trailed by his faithful concubine. - Ignore it. - Ignore this. It's time you all dug it. We're talking heavy changes. Those that aren't with us are swept away. Your janitorial threats don't frighten me. You see, I have something none of you has. The unbeatable power of knowledge. Sure. Arthur can always bore us to death. You'll regret that. All right, you elitist, computerized stooge. It's time for a showdown. I still say all he needs is a good fuck. Look at him. He's not even wearing his hearing aid. I already told you he's past listening. Well, he'll listen to this or suffer the consequences. Why is it that people with the least to say are always the most insistent and strident on saying it? What is it now? More empty, bombastic threats? These are hardly empty, Arthur. Arthur? Hey, Arthur. He's dead. Let's just get out of here. Don't look at us. I didn't have nothing to do with it. Look, I think it's time we cut out. - Where to? - Anywhere, man. Things around here are getting real, real ugly. Sure, listen, let's just take off and go have some fun and come back when all this shit blows over. I guess that's best. Okay. Let's go. Yeah, let's go. I don't understand. Why Oscar? Who cares? He was an asshole. Well, I wasn't crazy about the guy myself, but... David, what do you think is going on? I think obviously somebody in this school is insane. A psychopathic killer? - Yeah, I guess so. - Sure. I knew one day you rich bastards would get so bored you'd start bumping each other off. Hey, Rodney, I don't think it's fair to... Hey, get out of my sight before I clobber you. Yeah, but, Rodney... Hey, Spoony. Jane, come here. Come here. Hey, friend, spare a minute? What are you doing here? Didn't know I even knew where you lived? You know, I know much more than people think. Congratulations. You learn a lot, always keeping in the background, letting other people shoot their mouths off. - Oh, no. - Oh, yes. And you sure have been busy, David? And I must say, you've improved the atmosphere at school much more than I ever would have thought possible. I'm glad you approve. Oh, I do. I do. But, you've made one oversight. One son of a bitch you haven't been able to get rid of. - Who, you? - No. Mark, of course. He's got something coming to him. And there's no reason in the world why you shouldn't have that sexy, little plaything of his. You'd like that? Well, here's my idea. Now, what would happen if we both just happened to have seen Mark plant one or two bombs? I mean, we'd have to tell the authorities, once we realized what we'd seen. We let the law take care of him. You inherit Theresa, and I inherit the school. I mean, now they blame Spoony, Mary, and Jane, but, we both know the evidence is pretty circumstantial. Well, you think about it and, let me know, but... sooner the better. How do you know David did anything? The police are satisfied it was those three. Who conveniently blew themselves up in the process. - You believe that? - No. Well, look, it's gotta stop. I mean, I can't just do nothing, go on being a silent accomplice. You can't blame yourself, Mark. Nine people are dead because I didn't act. I did act. I spoke to him. I didn't even think about the others. Not even about David. And that makes me guiltier than you. Well, it's gotta stop. What'll we do? Not the police. No, I can't do that. I... I still can't turn him in. Then what? Talk to him. I'll just talk to him. I'm gonna go with you, Mark. No. Theresa, I've gotta do this alone. Okay. I'll see you later. Believe me, Mark, I really wanna go with you. Look, it's between him and me. So... you've finally become man enough. Yeah, I hope so. But I feel a little late. No, not actually. I'm not quite through here yet. You can still be a hero. You really think that's what I want? No, I guess you just want to absolve your guilt. Equally self-indulgent. Go to hell. I, guess you're about to send me there? Man, you forced me. Why? Those three guys, even me, okay. But why the others? What did they do to you? That's not the point. See, it's what I did for them. When I came to that school, they weren't people. They were scared mice. They didn't have a chance. So I got rid of the guys keeping 'em down. But when they were on their own, they were as bad as the ones I'd killed. I couldn't bring them back, so, to be fair, I had to get rid of the others. Who the fuck do you think you are? Just a mad man. Mark? You blew it, friend. No. He'd kill you. - No, he won't. Let go of me. - Now Mark knows best. You'll have to excuse me for a minute. I've got... things to do at school. What's he gonna do? Blow up the school. Why? I guess because Harvey's no better than Spoony. Were you really gonna kill him? I had my chance. I didn't shoot. We might just get blown up with the rest. No, not if we make it there in time. He won't do it. Why? Because he's in love with you. Get the hell out of here now. No. We're staying. Well, I'm leaving then. Look, you've got three minutes. I've warned you. That's all I can do. Theresa, understand that in three minutes, everyone here will be dead. I know, and so will I. Look, it's been a long time since we talked, and let's not waste the time in silence. Well? Let's dance. It's just a fire. Just a little fire. Let's all go in now. Nothing to it. Come on. Let's keep on dancing. Everybody inside. Why don't they ban the sale of firecrackers in this country altogether? Wait a minute. What's wrong? Police. We say he discovered that Spoony, Mary, and Jane had left one more bomb, and he came to remove it. Subtitled by Post Haste Digital
