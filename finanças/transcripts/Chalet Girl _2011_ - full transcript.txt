(скowd сheeкs) - Whoa. - What a wild kickflip wallplant! lt takes me back to my boarding days. Funny. cos l feel like the only boarding you did was with charlie and Henry and the horrid biscuit game. Oh, OK, yeah, fair point. The competition has been amazing. The girls have been great. But the one everyone is talking about, Kim Matthews, is still missing. We've actually got some footage of her as an early skateboarding prodigy. Kim started competing when she was seven. She won the National Mixed Under-1 6s when she was just 1 1 years old. l mean, attractive girl even then. - Really? Because l said 1 1 . - Yeah, objectively. (woman) Two years ago, aged 1 7, she won the London Trials. (man) Mum and Dad supported her with parental pride and simplistic homemade signs. Then nothing. We haven't seen her since. (woman) There was an accident, Rick. The car crash, when she lost her mum. We're thinking of you, Kim. Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, we hope you're riding high and living the dream. (man on PA) And today's speсial: two for one on onion rings. Onion rings, two for one. Please don't push. - (Dad) l thought it was junk mail. - (Kim) Big red letters. "Not junk mail." lt says "Urgent Demand" on it. - They always say that. lt's hardly... - lt's nearly a grand. Dad, you can't just ignore it. But, hey, we're big hitters, right? We'll just sell the Bentley. Oh, no, someone's stolen the Bentley. Plan B? They're bluffing. l'll think of something. How are you getting on? No. Nothing yet. - l'll talk to Les. Sort something out. - What would l do without you? Fester. Hmm! My rota is... full. Maybe if you're extra nice to me? Hmm? Oh, Les, don't be a cock all your life. (Les on PA) That's your extra niсe? How did my summer job become the rest-of-my life job? A friend of my cousin's just got into this well-good scam. catering agencies. Serving champagne and tiny food to toffs. e1 2.50 an hour. Hmm. Toffs and champagne or Les and... Urgh. l can get the number if you want. You gotta be posh, though. Posh? Trace, l can do posh. - Hi, l'm Arabella. - l'm Henrietta. - lsabella. - Petronella. Kim. White wine? Yes. Red wine? Yes. Dessert wine? No. sound Is it true wnat tney say about posh girls? (сrasn) (Kim) Shit. You're a lovely girl, but l'm just not sure. Let me try. You're just not sure l'm the right kind of girl for your clients. lt's hard to say why exactly, but it's probably to do with the fact that l'm not called Arabella or lsabella or anything-bella. l don't have hundred-quid highlights, perfect nails or, l'm just guessing here, expensively trimmed pubes. So even though l'm the only person with actual experience of actual work in the actual real world, and you know l'd try really, really hard, l'm just not the right kind of girl. - ls that about the size of it? - About there, yes. (Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" ringtone) This is Bella. She did what? Oh, for God's sake, the silly cow. Yes, it's the day after tomorrow. Everyone's booked out. Wait there, er,... Kim. - (Dad) lt sounds great. - l said no. - What was the job? - cooking and cleaning. Same as l do at work. Same as l do here. - Was the pay rubbish? - No, it's better. Double, plus tips. But... But still... But still what? lt's in a ski chalet. ln Austria. For four months. - Right. Well, l'm sure l could... - You couldn't. l'd come home and find a skeleton on the couch holding the remote. That's a bit harsh. - Totally the right decision. - You think so? Yeah. What's a luxury chalet with hot, rich clients in a beautiful ski resort got on this place? lt's a no-brainer. - Oi, l found this toenail in my... - Don't even try. See? Would you get that kind of quality entertainment in Austria? l don't think so. Hi, it's Kim Matthews from yesterday. l was wondering if you're still... (Bella) Still desperately seeking a сhalet girl? Yes, i am. - You are? - Could you do it? You have to be there tomorrow. It's ten nours on tne overnignt train. (Kim) Right. i'm making freezer food to last until April. You know how the microwave works? (Dad) It's a magnetron tnat сonverts eieсtriсity... - (Kim) No, no, no. Like on, off? - (Dad) Yean, yean. What am i doing? i'm paсking you off to some mountainous wasteland, while i'm stuсk here looking for a job. (Kim) It'ii nappen, as iong as you keep trying. - (Dad) But you're oniy 1 9. - (Kim) Exaсtiy! I'm 1 9. It's Austria. Hardiy a wasteiand. (Dad) Austria. Famous for "The Sound of Music", breaded food and the invention of psyсhoanalysis. You join tne dots. (Kim) You're suсh a freak. No wonder nobody wiii nire you. - And you won't forget to have a bath? - (Dad) Every montn. (Kim) I give up. And what exactly am l supposed to do with this? - What is it? - You can't live on beans on toast. We won two world wars and one World cup on beans on toast, so don't knock 'em. l've set it up online, so you'll get a delivery every week. Lexi, this is my health-freak dad, Bill. Bill, this is Lexi. l'm trusting you to keep him alive till l get back, OK? - (сar norn beeps) - Shit. My pay goes into the mortgage account. l'll send any tips back. Any envelopes... Big red letters. l know. Now hurry up, you'll miss your train. - Maybe this isn't a great idea. - Go, now. - l love you, Kimberley. - l love you, William. Bye, Dad. - See you later. Auf wiedersenen. - (door snuts) (yodeiiing) Oh, my God, l'm never doing that again! l can't remember the whole night. Honestly. Oh, my God, did you see that guy staring at my tits the whole night? lt was so awkward. He was such a perv. And he had a hairy chest and everything. can you imagine? (iaugns) Yean. can l call you back, babes? - Seriously? - Yep. OK, let's go. Put your bags in the back and get in. Shit. (Kim) Oh, my God, they're huge. Yeah, they're mountains. Huge is part of the concept. You don't even ski, do you? What are you doing here? - lt's a job. l need to earn money. - Earn? What, as in, like, "save"? (toots norn) - Oh. - Thought l recognised that arse. - Alright, ugly. You coming out? - Yeah. Just dumping the new girl off. - The new girl! Let me see. - Kim, Jules. Jules, Kim. - Hi. - Hi. - l'll see you later, babes. - See you later, babes. (Kim) lt's a bit poky, isn't it? So is this guy head of some evil criminal empire? - He's a banker. - That's a yes, then. - You don't get it, do you? - Get what? This is the best job in the Alps. They use the place to entertain clients plus a few family weekends. Apart from that, they're hardly ever here. l had 30 girls texting me after Milly broke her leg, begging me for the job. But the agency said it had to be someone they'd seen. You know what's really funny is, l wasn't going to take it at first. OK, maybe not really funny but... Do what l tell you and if you're not up to it, l will tell them. Listen, a week ago l was mopping up puke in a burger bar. No, you listen, little Miss Essex no-coat, non-skiing freak show. l'm not actually from... The Madsens fly in at five. They expect pefdection from the start. Now, if you screw up or, more importantly, if you make me look bad, then clearing up puke will be a fond memory of the good old days. Got it? Oh! Got it. So l'll just make myself at home, then. sound Farmer in my own farm sound in, out and far sound From tne nign сeiiings (yodeiiing on TV) - Look out! - Hey! (man snouts / сniidren iaugn) (tuts) lt's a total nightmare. lt's not like you've got to spend the next four months sharing a room with her. - Oh, no, wait, you have. - l'm serious, babes. lt's like she's never seen snow before. lt's like she's from Africa. A chalet girl who can't ski. That's classic. - Tell me about it. Later, babes. - Later, babes. The three golden rules of chalet-girling. One, no friends up in the chalet. Two, party all you like, as long as breakfast is on the table at eight. - You oversleep, you pack your bags. - Friends, breakfast, check. Three, no sleeping with the clients. Unless they're fit. Or minted. Or hitting on you. - Basically, there's only two rules. - Basically, yeah. We're just going to get the essentials for now. Right, so shall l go and get the veg? Six tins of caviar, please. Beluga. caviar, right. Of course. l'm more front-of-house type, you're more back office. Because l know how to talk to them. Yeah, l don't speak much posh. Dropped it after GcSEs. - Do you want to prep the veg? - l live to prep veg. Right, carrots, we've got a big game coming up. l want to see each and every one of you giving 1 1 0 per cent. Are you done? Yeah. l thought you said they landed at five. l did. But the pilot called. They ran into some headwind. Oh, right... The who called? - (girl God, he's here already. - (Kim) Wno?

Anyway, he's taken. - Turned you down, did he? - No. So, what's the deal? How do l, you know, talk to them? You don't talk to them.

Dress up. l... did. Don't worry. She made me change too. Drainpipe jeans and winkle-pickers aren't very this season apparently. (cnioe) You were never a style guru. (Jonny) l was. Lippy. Liner.

See if you can figure out the whole champagne-bottle thing by then. - Yep, l will practise daily. - Knock yourself out. Trying to shake your hand, punch you in the stomach. Not cool. So, l'll put the photos on Facebook. Well,... poke me. Right. OK, girls. This is for all your hard work. Thank you so much. And, Kim, you know you get a lift pass too, don't you? Just charge it to the chalet. Unless you'd prefer the cash. - Lift pass would be great. - OK. - Alright, let's go. - lt's a private plane. lt can wait. - lt will. l won't. - Desperate to get back to work. OK, maybe l'll quit, and next time we can hitchhike here. A father-son adventure. l like the sound of that. Bye. - "Poke me"? - Piss off.

(Kim) Hey, watch and learn, my friend! Betty, wait up! lt's too soon! (сar norn biares) (yeiis) Whoa! (сnopping) l think that's enough carrots. Why give up now after you've worked so hard? - Because l don't feel like it, OK? - lt's just a sprain. This time. Then next time l break my neck. Then what? People die doing this stuff. - l thought you needed the money. - l do. Maybe if l hadn't spent it renting ski kit and replacing stupid speakers, which we haven't paid for yet... Jesus, Kim, we're meant to be having fun. Hello, this is Kim Matthews's phone. Leave a message after the tone. Bye! cheer up, babe. lt might never happen. lt has. lt continues to. Do you know what you need to do? Drink bleach? Good idea. Two capfuls. Bucket. Hot water. You know what they say, don't you? Tidy kitchen, tidy mind. l just feel like l'm losing her. People change. change is good. Where's her mum, then? Sutton Row cemetery. change isn't always good. Two capfuls? Yo-ho, snow-ho! (iaugns) - How's your arm? - lt's alright. lt's getting there. The doctor said it'll be fine in a few days. Oh. Wow, she can talk to me now, right? Now that captain America isn't calling her 50 times a day. l need my training buddy. They started building the course for the pro. - You wanna take a sneaky peeky? - No, l can't. We've got corporate guests. Big weekend. One hour? You've got to do this. Betty, you on a board, it's where you're meant to be. You've got so much talent it's unfair on the rest of us, so why... Betty... Sorry, Mikki. l can't. Bye. - Thank you, Kate. - Dad, her name's Kim. Where's that one from last year, Dickie? Really big tits, big arse? Henry Goodwin? He went bust, didn't you hear? - You prick! The chalet girl. - Milly broke her leg. - What, skiing? - Après-skiing. You're too lean for my taste. We'll have to fatten you up, love. Yeah, a bit more cushion for the pushin'. - They tip well. - They'd better. We need Malcolm to come in first. 40 mill, 50 maybe. The others will follow. - You worry too much. - You don't worry enough. - (Maicoim) Dickie, shift your arse! - Right. Let's get going. Georgie, you're coming with us to dish up lunch? Erm, actually l've come down with something. lt's like a little tickle. lt's like... (cougns) Oh. Well, you'd better come, then, erm... - Oh, Dad, for God's sake, it's Kim. - Kim. No, l should be... Ow. Fine. l'll get changed and get my lift pass. You don't need a lift pass. How can you not need a lift pass? Ah. You ever been in one of these things? Yeah, we got one at home. This one's pretty small. - Do we pay extra for irony? - No, the irony's free. - lt's the sarcasm you're paying for. - (iaugns) lronically. Oh, wow. - How long have you been on that thing? - About eight weeks. Jesus. Dickie... You can fly back on the bird if you're not sure. - She's fine. Trust me. - l don't want her holding us up. The global financial meltdown just happened to other people, right? l warned you about sub-primes. Greed is only good when it comes to lunch. Speaking of which, what is this? Special Austrian food. Strudel, nudel and... knodel. l wouldn't mind a "canoodle" with this one in fact. Right, nearest the pin, lads. lt's 50s in and it's... l'm going to go 32c. lt's hard to tell. The jumper might be bulking her up. Put me down for a 30B. Miles off. l'm thinking 30D, the Holy Grail of bra sizes. controversial. Go on, Kimmy, put us out of our misery. No, Kim, don't answer that. l'm sorry. l was under the impression that we were enjoying ourselves. Unlike most women you know, Malcolm, Kim keeps her clothes on for a living. Oh. lt's alright. You know what they say. The bigger the chat, the smaller the chap. (Diсkie iaugns) (Dickie) New game. Waistlines. Malcolm? (Maicoim) Fantastic weekend, Dickie. Flattery will get you nowhere but some fresh powder and a couple of tasty chalet tarts will get you 40 mill. - Dad, wait. - Forgotten your hair-care products? Actually, l was thinking about staying a couple more days if it's OK. Hey, do your thing. Back for the weekend, obviously? Yeah, of course. l'll see you guys soon. There's, like, 400 euros here. Should think so too. Bloody perverts. Jonny didn't ask us to pay him back for... Thanks for reminding me. (сiears tnroat) - (Georgie laughs) - Oh, and you. Yes. OK, so that you can earn yours back, l want to hire you. 50 euros an hour. Not like that. - Need a hand? The meter's running. - No. That's three euros right there. Well, it's your money. Actually, it's mine now. Again. Show me what's so great about boarding. Let's get gnarled. - Gnarly. - Whatever. Sick, phat, ill. You sound like a doctor. - Holy shit, l'm a natural. - Shut up, snoogles. (Jonny) Move back into position. - (Jonny) Watch this one. - (Kim) Now concentrate. - (Jonny) OK. - ldiot. l think you mean, "concentrate, please, valued paying customer." - (Jonny) Oops. - Ow! - OK, that was an accident. - l'm not going to be your bit of fun. - (Kim) Go on, then. - Yes, yes, yes. (Kim) come on, loser. l'll show you how it's done. Yes! (Kim) So you have a pretty rough life, huh? - (Jonny) Hideous, isn't it? - l don't know how you stand it. lt's not all it's cracked up to be. l've heard that having loads of money can be a real let-down. You think l could do anything l want to? Truth is, my dad's been saving a place for me on the board since l was two and my mother won't be happy until l've married chloe and have nine children with perfect teeth. They've got it all planned out for me and l'm, like, "This is it? This is my life?" No, nice try, but not quite. Oh, angst. The rich kid's alternative to real problems. Sarcasm. The chalet girl's alternative to real humour. l know l'm lucky... "But l'm stuck in this caged existence of vintage champagne and luxury ski chalets when l just want to be a pop star." Rock star. - Why don't you just do it, then? - lt's just not that simple. - What? - lt's nothing. No, what? Go on. lt's just a bit silly. My mum always used to say, "You've got brains in your head, feet in your shoes." "You can steer yourself in any direction you choose." clever girl, your mum. Yeah. We should get going. (Jonny) Yeah. (Georgie) l hope you know what you're doing. - Excuse me? - l'm just saying. The season ends, he goes back to his world, you go back to yours. What are you left with? (scoffs) My world? Where exactly is that? Pluto? - No, that's not what l meant. - Don't judge me by your standards. You'd rather be with a rich idiot like Nigel instead of Mikki who you are clearly in love with. - l'm going for a beer. - There's something you need to know. l think l'm done on the friendly advice for now, thanks. lt'd be better if you just stay out of it, OK? Do you want to talk about it? A barman's cheaper than a shrink. A beer's cheaper than a barman. - l'm pretty cheap. - Beer doesn't talk back either. (Jonny) Hey. Are you OK? - She told you where l was, then? - l'm staying out of it. Look, about us... Night, Jonny. What l really came to say was l booked the helicopter again. l need someone to serve me lunch. You are so annoying. sound i feei sweet sound Do you feel sweet? sound It's amazing sound i have no skin, and i feel everything sound It's amazing sound i've wanted this for so long sound Now the deed has been done sound We shall rise with the sun sound Spend our time as one sound Now tnere is no sin in anytning sound it's life-changing sound This feeling sound It's amazing sound From now on sound We are one sound It's amazing sound it's in the stars, in the sun sound It's everywnere, in everyone sound And it wiii be every day sound From now on sound We are one sound It's amazing (Jonny) lt's like pass the parcel. 34B. Knew it. What? Nothing. (Kim) Would it freak you out if l said that was the best day of my life? OK, maybe not the best, but certainly top... five. What is with you people walking in on me naked? l think the idea was you stayed below stairs, young lady. And you, don't you have an engagement party to go to? For a second there l thought she meant... Oh. - l did try to tell you. - (Kim) lt's not hard. "Did you hear Jonny proposed to chloe?" "No. Thanks for letting me know, chum." l didn't want to see you get hurt. Yeah, you just did a spiffing job all round, didn't you? She's a chalet girl. My God, it is such a cliche. l wouldn't have minded so much if you were discreet but Bernhardt said you were all over each other, on the beginner slope! Bernhardt could learn a few things about being discreet himself. Honey, do you realise what you're risking here? You have to stop this right now, or l will. This isn't Jane Austen, Mum. Look, when you and Dad met... Enough, Jonathan. l just think you can do better. Well, l don't think Dad could have done better. Look, your father and l, we got lucky. But believe me, this girl is only after one thing. Yeah. And it was great. - ls there a reason you're still here? - Look, Kim, can we just... There's a noise. l can't quite... Oh, that's right, it's a lying bastard. Yeah. OK. Erm, well, look, l owe you... three hours. (iaugns) Shit. Kim! Kim, wait! Kim! Kim! About 8:30 tomorrow. l'll cook you a nice tea to celebrate. - What about the competition? - l was never going to win. lt's fine. l can come back and sort you out. l've lasted three months. l'm sure l can manage another week. Dad, l looked online at your latest order. 24 tins of beans? Are you giving up the chance of a lifetime because l'm eating too many baked beans? Someone's got to take care of you. Oh, no, you don't. Don't you dare do that, Kimmy. Don't you put this on me. This is your decision. Anyway, sinсe wnen did my Kimmy ever say tnere was no way she was gonna win something? l'll tell you something else, Kimberley. What, William? lt's what she would have wanted. Haiio. Was bekommst du? Erm, what do you want? lt's a beautiful spring morning here in St Anton, perfect conditions for the open qualifiers! come on! come on! (commentator) ..ranks with a kicker. Mixing things up and finishing off with a super styley 540 that should see him through to the weekend's final. And there it is, a 73! That sends Hampton through. Next up, from Finland, Mikki Niemenan! - That's you, champ. - ls Georgie out there? Well, don't think about her. Think about the run. Only the run. Be the board. (start-gate monitor) Go! (commentator) Here he goes, the Finnish freak now going down, hammers those rails! Niemenan showing some impressive skills. Switch 50-50, backside 1 80. Sweet! coming up to the booter where he fell last year. Hits it, going for broke! Whoa! And broke it is! He's up, but he's going to have a monster headache in the morning. - You sure you want this? - Just do it. And in the ladies' qualifiers now... Don't worry, it's legal. - Better than sex too. - ..Tara Dakides! A solid 50-50 on the goalpost. Boom! She spread some butter on the box! And a frontside seven lean! A master class from the master! The Greek goddess! Whatever, man! She is awesome! The Queen of Scream is back! - Ow! - Now, last up, strapped in, trying to follow an amazing run, newcomer Kim Matthews. Let's see wnat sne nas got! Drei, zwei, eins. Go! A front 1 80 to switch tail, a 1 80 out! Textbook awesomeness! A silky tail press. Nice one, Matthews! Throwing an indy grab coming off the box! And here she goes now, coming up to the big booter! (сar norn biares) What's happened there? She's stopped short and takes the lame line down. Kim might have done just enough on the top section to get into the main event. Oh, no. 59, just outside qualification. Kim will be back on finals day, but she'll have to wait and see if she gets a ride. l came 21 st. Yay! That's great. How many qualify? The top 20. So, suddenly, not so yay. l am first reserve though. - i get a chance if someone pulls out. - You gave it your best shot though. (door opens) - Dad, l've got to go. - OK, bye. Bye. - (Mikki iaugns) - Finland! Morphine rules! lt's just ligaments, thank God. Oh, piss off! Again. (snoring) - (Wiiiy) Hi. - (gasps) So you are the Yeti. Must be the hair. Want to talk about it? No. lt's just something that... Er... We were... We were driving home, and, erm... l'd just won the London Trials and... all of us in the car, me and my mum and dad, were singing at the top of our voices and we were all laughing cos none of us can sing for shit. And, erm... Er... My dad had to swerve, and... And he skidded off the road. And my... My mum was on the side that got hit, and... And she died. My mum died. l just really miss her. Sorry. l'm so sorry. l always get like this when l'm around Yetis. Let's ride. (Wiiiy) l always tell the mountains my problems. They're good listeners. Two minutes. l'm going to go and tell the caterers. (man) Jonathan! Deidre and l would like to say... Lord and Lady Marberry, can l get you another drink? Well, why not? Good to see you. lf you've got to do it, do it now. He had it the entire time we were there and l had no idea. Such a surprise. - Excuse me. can l have a word? - Yeah. Thanks. What's up? What? - What is it? - Erm... l have an idea that l wanted to run by you. How-How would you feel if we didn't get married? How would that sit with you? - Good idea. - Really? You're OK with this? Of course l'm not OK with it. - Look, l understand it's bad timing. - Do you really? Ending a five-year relationship in the middle of our engagement party? Yes, l think that constitutes bad timing! (room falls silent) - l'm sorry, l'm... - An asshole is what you are! Exactly right. l am. You're in love with her, aren't you? Exactly right. l am. Someday l will probably thank you for this, for not going through with it just to please your mother. But today... (aii gasp) Today, it's not quite how l'm feeling. Here, l got you some ice for the swelling. They're gonna blow up. come on, let's go. - And for your next trick... - You're not upset? She's lovely, but l trust you. - Your mother, on the other hand... - (wine giass tings) Ladies and gentlemen, l give you the happy couple. ln the unlikely event of an emergency landing, the cabin crew will direct you to the nearest available exit. lt was like love at first sight. They were kids, if you can believe that. (signs) OK, baby. Let's get you drunk. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Yeah, laters, babe. Yeah. Oh, my God! You guys are never going to believe what happened to Jonny and chloe. Apparently there was this major showdown at their engagement party. Hattie says chloe dumped Jonny in front of everyone and Jonny stormed out. But Pips also tweeted that it was Jonny who broke up with chloe and chloe just passed out, right there. Either way, it was just super-dramatic, right? What? l couldn't care less. Welcome to Channel 419, broadcasting iive from St Anton, Austria. Let's go to our giri on tne sсene, Jasmine Kendal.
