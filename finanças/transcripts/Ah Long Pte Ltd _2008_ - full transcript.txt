Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, turn. Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Turn, two, three, four, turn, turn. My name is JoJo and I like to dance. I am a professional dance instructor. It's hot, I need water and towel. - Thank you! - Welcome. Mr. Fang, can you style a special image for me? I want to scare my husband. Your face is not scary enough? Don't you have a designer? That wasn't a real designer. I've heard people like you are best at image styling. Teacher, my request is simpler, it will be good if I look like Jolin Tsai. I don't do simple jobs. You don't know how to talk. You should join the transvestites pageant. If you join, all of them can step aside. Do us proud! You wish! Let me tell you three, I'm very much a normal man. I'm very masculine, okay? If you three lie down now, I can make all of you pregnant! We're not afraid! Come on! Dancing makes me feel alive. I am a happy-go-lucky person, so "lucky" till I married a loan shark without knowing it. So unlucky! Shao He Gang is a big Triad group. They do all sorts of money-making businesses. They earn big bucks by being loan sharks. This tomboy is Sister Hua, No. 2 leader. And also my wife. They are Soldier Head and Emperor. They have followed Sister Hua for many years. This is the head of Shao He Gang, Chen Jun. For years, he has offended many other gangs. Are you Chen Jun? What's up? Shao He Gang! Thank you. Take a seat. All of you are too polite. You don't need to come if you're busy. It's just a minor injury, you don't need to bring me so many gifts. There's deep grievances with Qing Long Gang. Boss, we must regain our dignity! Regain dignity! Yes, we must regain dignity! This finger nearly broke. Boss, I will regain this dignity for you. Good! Take a seat. Today, since all of you are here, I have something to announce. I... have decided to retire. Retire? Why? Boss, why are you leaving us? Without you, what should we do? Boss, the gang can't go on without you, boss! Boss, you cannot leave! Look at them, they can't go on without you! All right, stop crying! Boss don't go! Chen Jun is a sly old fox. Some say he acts childish. He likes doing things that makes people nervous. He likes to see everyone nervous. He secretly feels satisfied. He's an old man with only this joy. Is that pathetic or funny? You still got to respect him. He retires at his peak. Not many leaders in this world who built their empires with bare hands, can retire so easily. Very impressive! The gang's event is like a National Day celebration, except there's no helicopter flying across. Now, the bad are copying the good. And the good are doing what the bad would do. So, what is good and what is bad? It's better for the common people to pretend that they don't know. SHAO HE GANG Now my wife is the gang chief, there's more pressure. Chen Jun says my wife will make decisions on all the gang matters. He will retire completely. After hearing his words, should I be happy or sad? Yeah! Hua... For my wife, the worst is not the gang matters. It's her mother's naggings to get married. The older her mother gets, the more worried she is. Actually, it's not just my wife. Many decent women can't find a partner. Let alone a gang leader like my wife. Fourth aunt's daughter is getting married, and, your old neighbor, the big mouth aunt's youngest daughter has given birth to a pair of twins. All our relatives and friends kept asking, why aren't you married? Are you listening? Stop watching TV! When are you getting married? Look at me, how will I get married? How? I remember when you were born, I gave you two breasts. Where are they? They're useless to me, so I put them away! Why do you put them away? Students in the morning class, please don't give up. If you didn't do well this time, just work harder. You can do it! This is the idioms dictionary I used last year. It's yours now. I have confidence in you, good luck! After the rain, the sun shines. "Regardless of the rain, dark clouds cannot cover the sun." Before I, JoJo Fang, ever existed, her mother tries to sell her off. Not missing any man out. Frankly, he has stage 3 cancer. Hope you'll marry him to make his last days happy. Here's his insurance. He has bought a lot of policies. Speak. Who are they? Tell him, Petaling Street is our territory. Tell him to get stuffed! Who are they? CID? So what? Tell them to go to hell! Hold on! What did you just say? CID? Then we go to hell. Did you see that? Even the dying runs away! Look at your outfit. Can you learn from Man U? Learn from Man U? Show half of our breasts! Hey, Miss! What Miss? I'm a Mister! Can you read or write? Of course I can, unlike you! Come over and help me. - What for? - Come! Come! What do you want? Is it correct? IF NO MONEY TO PAY BACK, WILL CUT YOUR HEAD ANDHORN! - Wrong. - Really? This word is wrong, the correct word is "owe." Really? This word means "head." It should be "hand." Really? This is funny, the word "horn" is wrong, too. Horns are for devils. Humans have legs. Got it? Devils have legs, too! Legs are below. I'm talking about horns on top! If you don't believe it, why do you ask me? Why are you writing these? IF YOU OWE MONEY BUT DO NOT PAY BACK, WILL CUT YOUR HEAD & HORN! You are those blood-suckers! Ah-Longs! Hey! Ah-Long is used by illiterates! Not only did they not pay up, they called the police too. Miss, don't go there. Loan sharks are there! I was beaten up, it really hurts. Don't go over! I'm calling the police, someone may die! Why are you calling the police? Someone may die, we have to call the police! We're filming. - You know Candid Camera? - Yes. The camera is in front. Go. Stop hitting! Are you okay? Your acting is very real! You're so pretty, must be the lead! His blood looks fake, I can tell it's tomato sauce. And his bruises, neither black nor green, the make-up sucks! I can do better. I'm a make-up artist. Sometimes I do image styling, or choreography. I am an emcee too. Take this! Price is negotiable. I am very flexible. Thank you! You're so pretty! Sorry, my car broke down. Can your men help push the car? Thank you! Push please? Great, it's okay now. I'll go now. Call me! You're pretty! Hubby, you can't leave us behind! Don't leave us! Boss, he owed us money and called the police. You didn't pay and called the police? I didn't call the police... They all say that! He's putting on an act! Beat him up! Hold it! Please, I beg you, let us off! My father borrowed money for my studies! Get lost! Please, I beg you, let us off! We'll pay you back! I beg you, please let us off! I beg you, please let me off! If you're dead, we might let you off. Well, I'll die! No! Mother! Mother! Wake up! Mother! Loan sharks are bashing people! Loan sharks are bashing people! KILL! DIE HIGHLIGHT: TO COLLECT DEBTS AH LONG BURNED THE HOUSE THE INNOCENTS ARE HURT The police will not let these loan sharks off. I advise fellow citizens, don't borrow from loan sharks. It is a serious offence. And it does not benefit you. All the loan sharks out there, don't act deaf! And disregard our words. Harming the debtors and their family is a cowardly act. A cowardly act. Old woman, you are here too? You come here to pray too? Where have you been? I thought you were gone! Don't worry, if I'm "gone," I'll grab you along! Touch wood! If I go now, it will be okay. I can go anytime. See, my grandson is so big now. He's such a good boy! What about yours? Huh? Mother, let's pray. May the Gods bless my daughter to marry a good husband. I am willing to live 10 years less. So your daughter is not married yet. No wonder you don't have grandchildren. The Gods up there are good. After you have prayed, men will queue from Kuala Lumpur to Penang, waiting to marry her. By then, she will find it hard to choose who to marry! - Really? - Of course! Does it really work? Of course! Let's not waste time! Daughter, let's go! Let's go up and pray, and you'll be married off. Then I'll have grandchildren. After seeing the girl's parents being forced to death, and with the police's close watch on Shao He Gang, my wife is worried about the gang's future. She copies the government structure. She invites experts to provide ideas to help Shao He Gang start a new business model. The banks sued many people to go bankrupt. The media never reports that. But when loan sharks splashed paint, or hang a pig's head, they become breaking news. We must learn to be smart. I suggest a reformation. We vote for new leaders! Rubbish! Old members are unhappy about the reformation. This is a common situation across the board, they are the same. It's lucky that the majority of the gang members supported this. As the saying goes "Old gives way to the new." My wife begins the first round of reforms following the expert's advice. First, we re-create loan shark's image. I know you wrote "Young and Dangerous." Now, I want a song for loan sharks. We are busy, can you wait? Wait? Okay! Actually, we have a song! Sing it now! Mr. Loan Shark is here to visit Daddy Daddy is not in I ask him to take a seat And serve him tea Do you think we are kids? One more! There's one more! Be serious! A-la-la-long Long-long-long-long-long! A-la-la-long Long-long-long-long-long! I am Ah Long! I want a touching song for loan sharks, if not, I will burn down your houses! Okay! I feel helpless and walk into darkness When I want to speak, everyone leaves No one cares about my pain I am going to cry Suddenly someone gives me hope Even though media spoils its image They don't care And still lend a helping hand They are our poor men's banks A-la-la-long... A-la-la-long... We lend money, but police still catch us We help the poor But the world detests us Ah Long! Ah Long! This will change the perceptions of loan sharks. Sister Hua, thanks to you, our image has become positive. Not having enough money is not what we want. Only Shao He Gang is able to help you. We have launched a special loan package. Those who sign up today, will enjoy a low interest rate of only 10%. To change their image, Shao He Gang, gives a special package. Everyone is crazy about it! So, my wife is not that bad after all. I am worried that this launch in KL will invite more troubles. No choice, Sister Hua. We have checked the Feng Shui. Do you know why KL prospers the loan sharks? Why? Kuala Lumpur gathers all energy for loan sharks! Prosperity. Yeah! I would like to thank all gang leaders for attending today's meeting. Besides exchanging blacklisted debtors, we will talk about Shao He Gang's loan package. The interest rate is so low, might as well charge no interest! You have broken our rules! Don't take us for fools. We know you are trying to get rid of all of us! You want a monopoly, it's not that easy! Hong Qing Long, what are you talking about? Qing Long Gang ambushed us again and again, I didn't retaliate. I am not scared of you. I am telling you, violence begets violence. I value my members' safety above all else. You don't care about your members' safety. I do! Crazy! Gangsters without violence, what is left then? Back to the topic, bitch! We, the loan sharks, always help people. But for many years, we are like rats. Everybody hates us. Why? We have helped many financially in need. This is a contribution to the society. Why are we not being appreciated? Should we fight for justice from Zhang Tian Ci? He only listens to those who claimed as victims. But these "victims" owe us money and refuse to pay! Some ran away and disappeared completely! We are the real victims. Well said! See, she cries! She controls her tears with ease, watch! My wife cries to let everyone know that loan sharks must change their operating rhythm. Or they will be eliminated by police. My wife meant well. But Hong Qing Long thinks she is talking nonsense! Not only did Long not listen, it made him more angry. Bitch. You won! Watch your way! Although my wife is busy with the gang issues, she is busier going for match making sessions arranged by her mum. Fat woman! Old woman! I have arranged for another man. Really? Daughter, did you hear that? One more man! Come, let's take a look. No, Mother, I am not going! My dear daughter! Never mind, you take me there first. How is it, Sister Hua? You don't want Andy Lau? How about someone like Louis Koo? Or do you want someone like Aaron Kwok? How about Edison Chan? Too young? Qing Long Gang never stops their revenge. See, they strike again. Watch out! Hello? I can't hear you, speak louder! Go out! Can't hear you! Yes, what is it? No. Hey! Hey! How can you gang up to bully a girl? Shame on you! Hands up, don't move! I will shoot you, and I mean it! Run, Miss! Don't move, if not I will shoot! Run! Hua! Teacher! Stop! Who gave you permission to play here? Got black and white? If you want to play here, apply in writing! Give me a copy of your identity cards! If you want to play here, give me your birth certificates, you must follow the law! You think you all are gangsters? Why is everybody holding a knife? Go play outside, you rabid dogs! Why are you testing my patience! Police! Police! Thank you very much for your support! Now you can go for your shopping. Go! Oh, my daughter! Are you injured? No. Mother, let's go. Is this a filming again? Where is the camera? Stupid, I am fooled again! Are you shy? Your mother have seen it, right? I was still a boy, some parts have not grown big. When you look for hookers, aren't you shy too? I always switch off the lights. Li Hua. When I was attacked the last time, I asked you to burn down their busiest video shops, and chop those bastards up. You didn't listen to me. Now, we are attacked by them. Do you know what the outsiders are saying? They say Shao He Gang has no more power. Qing Long Gang has replaced us. Shao He Gang is led by a woman, and the gang is in a mess! It disgraces me! What are you waiting for? Send the gang to chop them up! Now! Hang on! Boss, we can fight it out with them anytime. But both parties will suffer great injuries! So I have a smart way to attack them, without sacrificing our members. I see your wings are grown. You can fly! Don't be stubborn! You think your way is better than mine? Boss, let me try, please? No! Do it my way, now! As Shao He Gang's leader, my wife has her own ways. Chen Jun wants her to fight it out, she insists on her own ways, no violence. She informs the police secretly to raid Qing Long Gang's drug-trafficking places. It drives Long mad! How did the police know? Fine! Our members say, you are going to act friendly now. Even has advertisements to promote it! You even heed those "experts" advice to do a reformation! You better not do anything stupid. A lot of things remained unchanged for a reason. Good to be smart, but don't be a smartass! If you fail, I am still the one to clean up your ass. Qing Long Gang! I had one finger injured, all of you came to visit. Now I'm no longer the leader, no one is here! Damn it! Someone is still smarter. He gains respect as a Minister Mentor after retirement. I should have learnt from him. Now, no one respects me! Damn it! Where's is Li Hua? Is she here? Boss. These people didn't protect you. I brought them here for punishment. Kneel down! Wait! Boss, Qing Long Gang is after me. I didn't protect you, it's my fault. You've suffered, please forgive me. Listen carefully! I want Shao He Gang back like before. Shao He Gang is strong! Not weak! Please don't spoil its image! Send our men to burn down their stalls! Attack their debtors! Actually, my wife feels helpless. Boss pressures her despite his retirement. At home, her mother pressures her. So she pressures Soldier Head and Emperor. Ask that sissy dance instructor to marry me! Yes! Marry me! Marry me! Is it funny? Soldier Head and Emperor then pressure me. It's outdated! You are still filming Candid Camera? Don't think I can't see the camera. There is one behind the tree. There is one outside. And over there! Three in total. You think I do not know? No one watches this program anymore! I look good today, so you want to film me. I won't let you film! There's smoke! It's not a horror film! Hey! How many times must I tell you? You wanna eat shit? Shit can't be shown on TV. I refuse to let you film! I will speak Hokkien, Cantonese. I will speak Teochew, Hakka. You cannot catch me! Don't hit my face, it hurts! The TV station is rich. Can afford a real knife! Be careful! My plastic surgery cost thousands! Stop playing! It's not that I don't want to marry her. I am worried. You know what is it? WEDDING FUNERAL Touch wood! Don't spit on my face! I am actually not superstitious. But I have a cursed life. I may cause her death, her mother's death. Maybe even yours, too! Then I will have to be a nun, I mean, a monk. Amithabah. Don't hit my face, it's painful! Well, I have never been married. Haven't you heard? Boy fears a wrong job, woman fears a wrong husband. It's man, not boy! It's the same! One week! Give me one week's time! You missed! I'm too slow! I won't marry her for sure! I rather marry a pig, a dog, a cat. But her! Sissy, listen up! If Sister Hua had not chosen you, you won't have a chance to get married! Use your brains! What did you just call me? Sissy. Sissy? Ask you mother to lie down, I will prove you wrong! This has nothing to do with my mother! It's a small matter, don't start a fight here! Exactly! Agree to it, sissy! Sissy again? Ask you mother to lie down, I will prove you wrong! Damn you sissy! Not so hard, my face hurts! Handsome, will you marry me? Let's start the cake-cutting ceremony! Let's cut the cake! A parang? My daughter is finally married! Kiss the bride! No! Ladies and gentlemen, since most of the members are here today, I'd like to clarify an issue. I may have retired, but the reformations made me worried. Based on my experience, this will threaten Shao He Gang's existence. I want to know if everybody thinks Shao He Gang needs the reforms! Boss! Come on, Boss! Give some respect to Hua. You can't say that! Look, there are so many outsiders around! That's what I want them to know and decide! You stupid woman! When I was in power, you kissed my ass. When I announced my retirement, you cried as though you were at my funeral! Now, I am not in power, you kiss her ass. I treated you well in the past, now you switched sides! You are terrible! How can you insult me this way! I only spoke the truth! Besides, today is Sister Hua's big day, why are you here to scold us? I didn't carry favor with you or carry your... Because you have no... Boss, what you have said, hurts me, you know that? This is my problem! I have trusted the wrong person! I trust the wrong person all the time. All of them are wrong! All of you have let this tomboy lead around! What's the matter? I am not finished, what are you trying to do? Take a rest! This tomboy is bossing around again! She refuses to let me talk! Afraid that I may expose her secret! We have freedom of speech! You have no rights to stop me! This is my freedom of speech! Freedom of speech! JoJo Fang... It's your night, don't disgrace yourself! I am telling you... You have to make her feel really good. Dear, let's get intimate. What do you want? What do you think I want to do? What else can we do? What? Don't act cute, it's not funny, how mushy! I'm tired. You're tired? Let's have a bubble bath together! I have rose essential oil, lavender... You feel refreshed after a bath, we can... I know she is faking it! Women always mean the opposite. Nuptial night, how can we miss it! What are you doing? So you like to play peek-a-boo. I am good at this! Come on! I must kiss you tonight! So you like violence, I am surprised! Violence, I am much better! To hell with you! I wish I can see what's going on inside! I wonder what they are doing, so good! I am so disturbed, I need my husband now! Tell me earlier if you didn't want to do it. I didn't force you. I just want to do lion dance, but you hurt me. I am giving you one more chance. Don't beg me later. So, do you want it? Still no? Just like all newlyweds, they enjoyed their nuptial night, but I don't. I thought I can be a real man tonight. Yet, I am still a small boy! I hate you for this! I will have phobia! In no time, I will suffer from erectile dysfunction! How is it? Can't eat? Can't sleep? What do you want? What I want is not important. The worst is that, you don't know what you want! You are good for nothing! Hey, let's do this. Come and be my consultant. I guarantee you I will help you get rid of the tomboy! Shut up! Want me to betray Shao He Gang? Are you nuts? Mother, breakfast's ready! Thank you! How was last night? Five times! Went to the toilet five times! The buffet was contaminated. I had diarrhea five times. No! The sixth time! You are here, take a seat. I need the toilet too, let me go first! Good morning, Sister Hua. Sorry for this early meeting. We are really desperate. What's this name list for? These are the debtors who called the police! If we don't do something, they will cause more troubles in the future. No violence, just give them some warnings. Stay low during this period. It won't do us good if we blow matters up. Got it. Hey, Fighter. Listen up. No violence. Just give some warnings! Roger that! Have some milk. It's good. Hello? I will be right there! I have something on, I got to go! Attack! Stop it! Mr. Fang! Hands off! - Mr. Fang? - Yes, it's me. They can pay you back if they owe you, but you don't have to beat them! You ask him! He didn't pay up but called the police! Sorry, the tables have turned! No! I didn't call the police! I didn't know how the police found out! Still denying! So many of you against him, shame on you! Damn it, sissy! How dare you insult us! You want to play hero right? Pay for them! Go and be a gigolo! And help them pay their debts! She has a good body. Her mother is even hotter! They can be hookers to pay their debts! Don't call me sissy! If your mother strips and lies down, maybe you will end up calling me Dad! Wack him! He has nothing to do with this! Don't beat him! Don't hit my face! It hurts! We will pay you back! Stop calling me sissy! I have a wife! Sissy has a wife? A sissy has a wife? All right! Call your wife now! Ask her to bring money, or I'll castrate you. Hello. Dear? Do you have ten thousand dollars? What's it for? Hey! Are you the sissy's wife? Which gang are you from? Bitch! Checking up on me? Don't be scared off by me! We are the poor men's hero, Shao He Gang! How much? Ten thousand bucks, bitch! Bring the money to Jalan Imbi now! Or hear your husband's orgasmic screams! He will be your eunuch, not your husband! Stay where you are. I am coming. Are you really a loan shark leader? Can you make it? The aura is so strong, can't you feel it? Can a woman be a gang leader? Can't a woman be a gang leader! - Painful? - Of course! How did I marry a loan shark leader? I am so unlucky! You are very lucky to have married Sister Hua! Her suitors queue from here to Thailand! That's right! Nonetheless, I have bad impressions on loan sharks. You have done it, what else do you want? What have I done? I didn't even do anything to her! I want a divorce! I can't be living with a beast! Who are you calling beasts? All of you! When you can't solve the problem, you bully the debtors' family. Harm their dad, mom, uncle, brother, sister! And the neighbors! Splash paint, post hell notes, hang pig's head! These are actions of a beast! You better apologize! Okay, I'm sorry! You're worse than a beast! I hated the loan sharks because they killed my dad when I was young! I had no paternal love, this made me sexually imbalanced. I saw how you treated Xiao Kang's family, it's really maddening! Just think about it, if someone harms your family, how would you feel? That's why the gang is reforming! Stop talking about reformations! If the loan sharks had changed, why are there still loan sharks around? One thing will never change. I want to divorce you! Last night was your nuptial night, now you want a divorce? What nuptial night? I didn't even touch her! All along, the gangsters are used to using violence to solve problems. If we suddenly ask them to change, they can't do it! So, we made the first move. You think the first move is great? Why not make the second? The second move is yours. You are the creative brain here. Don't throw the ball to me! Sorry, I will never help the loan sharks! A nuptial night is a hundred penny. It's hundred blessings! All you know is hookers! You're married to me, you belong to the gang. Make this clear, I didn't marry into your family. There is no difference. The police have your record anyway. So this is not just my problem, it is our problem. You're so evil! I'm so unlucky! Hence, I became a loan shark. I am innocent! How unlucky! Shao He Gang is the top gang in Singapore and Malaysia. THE ART OF BIG CHARACTER POSTERS We must be a role model. Look here. These are your graffiti. The handwriting is terrible. It's different here. These words are neat and nice and the content is pleasant. Look! "I understand your pain. Don't give up. Get in touch with me, let me help you." Finish off with two hearts, so sweet! When the debtors see these graffiti, they will contact you automatically. He will feel bad if he doesn't pay. I UNDERSTAND YOUR PAIN. DON'T GIVE UP. CONTACT ME. KISS See? Splashing paint is our job. But it is actually a form of art. Jackson Pollock is the master of this art. Unfortunately, such art are abused by Singaporeans and Malaysians. It's embarrassing! One thing for sure, we must preserve the art of splashing paint! As a responsible loan shark, when you splash paint, be quick, be sharp, be nice! Do not splash the paint onto your neighbor's house. Or you will end up with one more enemy! So do it well. In case we are caught, we can insist we are artists. Because artists get preferential treatment. Dear all, we are gathered here today, not to punish you, but to help you. You have no money to pay back. It will not benefit anyone if we force you to die. In the end, everyone will die! Shao He Gang has a new package. Let me tell you more! I have a song for you! Check it out! No money to pay, you need not escape We have a special package for you No matter how much you owe us This package will touch you If you have money to pay, it's perfect Can't afford to pay, we find you a job Got work, got money to pay So many jobs, no way you can't find one If you owe too much and can't pay up We want your kids, your wife, your parents Ask them to work We don't mind they pay us All matters can be discussed There's nothing we can't talk All matters can be discussed Violence is not our first choice We just need to play our part Violence is no longer effective We just need to play our part Borrowing money from us is fun, fun, fun! We have to change the way we collect debts. We want debtors to know we're very friendly. We have to let everyone know we are very entertaining. Ladies and Gentlemen, show time! AH LONG IS NOT A GOD, HE'S JUST A HUMAN Attention everyone We want to tell you something He doesn't look like a bad guy Actually he is a rascal He knocked on our door for help He said he needed some money He swore and he promised he would pay After taking the money He changed his number We said it would turn very ugly If he didn't pay He guaranteed he wouldn't give us trouble We told him, being loan shark is not easy He is a son-of-a-bitch He took the money and we can't find him We can't find him Pay us back We have family to feed I am kind to help you We are not charity organization Pay us back! It's our hard earned money Lie back and think carefully If you don't pay You won't have a happy ending Pay us back, it's very easy Pay us back It's very easy Pay us back Can this work? If you don't try, you don't know. Goal! Mother. I want to ask you. Are you going to have a baby? Are you not going to have babies? I won't give up! I won't give up easily! You must at least have one child! Do you want me to beg you? See? Your mother has complained. She made it clear. See how pitiful she cries? You're her daughter. You must respect her. For her sake, I went for a medical checkup. The doctor says I have very strong sperms. They charge like commandos! Frankly, it's a simple procedure. Shut your eyes and lie down. It will be done very soon. You think you are having buffet? You don't have a menu for me, I have to eat fast food! Get up! We're already married, nothing has happened. Your mother asked me, am I a sissy? What do you want me to say? Your brothers laugh at me, I'm starting to doubt myself now! I love to have a child one day, and show my love. What do you want? Goal! All right! You really want it? Come on then! Come on! Do it! You have a tiger tattoo? Come on now! Why are you shouting? I am not in the mood now! I am not a gigolo! I am not desperate! Fail again? Stay off. Pimple? My pimples are popping out! After rain, it always shines. Regardless of the rain, dark clouds cannot cover the sun. Can you knock first? There's no door, how to knock? You could have growled. Growl? I am not a beast. I am looking for my pimple cream. See! After rain, it always shines. Regardless of the rain, dark clouds cannot cover the sun. Before God entrusts you with a mission, your endurance will be tested, both spiritually and physically. Friends laugh at me, teachers dislike me. Everyone says I am a tomboy. I hate school! I hate them! Are you Ultraman from afternoon class? Are you Sweety from morning class? Can't be such a coincidence. Can this be real? Why didn't you reply me back then? I got into a fight, Old Maid changed my seat. I was so worried. I thought I had wrote something wrong! I was sad too! I didn't know how to find you. I was upset for a few months. Poor thing. You told me once, before God kills you... Entrusts you! - Kills you! - Entrusts you! - Kills you! - Entrusts you! Entrusts you! Your endurance will be tested. Your words had motivated me. Didn't know I was that great! This is a primary school kiss. Though my wife is against violence, she is in fact very violent. See! Do you want a bubble bath? Tired? I drank too much on your wedding day, got tipsy and created a mess. It's all right, not a big deal. Li Hua, it has been hard on you. From now on, I will not interfere with your plans to reform. I've led a busy life. I am not used to a carefree life. I understand. Frankly, with your new business model, our profits have increased 40%. This is a big blow to Qing Long Gang. It is actually like bringing our men to chop them up. I know, boss. Daddy look! I caught a fish! It's huge! Girl, you are good! You caught such a big fish easily! But this fish is innocent. Free it, don't hurt it. Okay? Sure! Qing Long Gang is pretty cunning. They've kidnapped our mothers. Mother! Who is behind this? How can Qing Long Gang harm the old! Scumbags! They've kidnapped my mother! Where did you get these? Someone on a bike threw them in. Qing Long Gang is up to no good. They kidnapped my mother, and his! Look how he tortured my mother! See this? I want revenge. Revenge! Brothers, calm down! From what I know of Hong Qing Long, he won't resort to these acts. It could be his sidekicks fooling around and he's not aware. I suggest we should ask Hong Qing Long out to settle this. If he can't settle this, we will bash him up! See if he'll still dare to kidnap our mothers! Li Hua, what do you say? What? You said we kidnapped your mothers? Damn! If you want to pick up a fight, don't give me lame excuses! Isn't Shao He Gang going around promoting non-violence and world peace? You don't practice what you preach! Don't try to fool me. If you kidnapped their mothers, let them go. Those who did this, you should punish them. Standard gang practice, settle with five tables. Listen up! We are interested in everything illegal. But not your mothers! If this fight continues, neither parties will benefit. The police stand to gain. What do you suggest? I have a good idea. It may be funny, but worth trying. Soccer match. Kick a ball? Kick your ass! Filming? Are you joking? I have no time for jokes. Okay. Li Hua, this way to settle our grievances, is better than a fight, killing our brothers! Don't you want this? A friendly soccer match without weapons? This fits your directions! We are bookies, we set illegal rules to collect illegal bets. We blame others if we lose. Hey, don't you know how to kick a ball? Let's gather all the gangs and have a soccer match. No weapons, no fighters. I'm telling you, whoever loses this match, will give up all territories! It's pretty boring to use a football. What do you want then? You never honor your words! Scared? Sister Hua, we are not afraid! We are not afraid! But I am. The durian is not Musang King, right? We are not afraid! Yeah! Charge! Lucky! Qing Long Gang never honor their words. We agreed not to bring weapons, yet they brought durians and sugar canes, claiming to throw a party. Durians and sugarcanes can kill! We were fooled. But we are lucky, the police came to save us. But we are unlucky too, the police are also here to arrest us. My wife and I are both injured. We can only hide in the jungle. It's ironic, we just got out from a durian fight, now we are hiding under durian trees. Who knows if the durian falls, we will still die. At this hour, what choice do we have? Besides the police, there are three assassins after us too. Oh, no! Emperor, Soldier Head and Boss, I wonder if they were killed. Who sent these assassins? But these three assassins are from a group. Its name is similar to SHE. They are called KNS, which means shit. Such clumsy assassins, how can they kill us? See! You suck at this. You aren't any better! At least I shot the tree. Can we stop running? My feet hurt! Shut up! It stinks! Run, they are coming! No, my feet hurt! I am not running! There's no way I am going in there. It's too filthy! I don't want! They are catching up! Are you afraid to die? Of course! - Afraid of death or stench? - Death! The jungle is huge, do we need to hide in a pond full of shit? Hurry up! It stinks! Sometimes we have to speak with mercy. Why? I always insult others they are like shit. Now I am really shit. Shut up! Let's go! My bag! Anything? Taking a piss, I didn't finish just now. Hello! I'm busy! Killing someone! One for two thousand. Leg or hand? Left leg right hand? It's up to you! Are you nuts? Pay by CPF? You need a doctor! Didn't you see a doctor? To hell with you! Hey! Wait for me! We don't have to feel sorry for ourselves. That fatty is dying soon. How do you know? He has diabetes, and it's pretty serious. I have never tasted anything so sweet. Let's go. Shao He Gang tries to avoid violence, but it's for their ears only. A cliché saying goes, "One has no choice given a situation." It's true. My wife came up with another line. I think it is very profound! Blood... is evil. Once it starts flowing, it won't stop. The police are efficient this time. They managed to discover us. We are doomed. Both sides want us dead. This is an unforgettable life experience. Shortcut! Thank god Malaysia is big. It's not easy to hunt us down. Sister Hua! What's that sound? Soldier Head, Emperor! Are you okay? We were so worried! We were so worried about you! I thought you were dead. You're still alive? Very lucky! Get up here! So stupid! That's a route there. How can you climb up this huge rock? How are you? I didn't owe you money, why are you here? Brother in trouble, can you help? Of course! Is there food? Yes, please wait. Cook something good! It's yummy! Who's calling at this hour? My aunt! Hello! Yes? Really? Aunt says someone kidnapped Mother! Qing Long Gang! This golden hair has a huge house! You go look for a car, I will go in. I hope our mothers are in there! No, hope your mothers are not in there! Where should they be? Then hope everyone's in there. We will rescue all of them. Go look for a car. Are you all right? Don't think you are smart. That's it, I'm coming now! Get in! What are you waiting for? They drive a Porsche! Okay. I have three reasons. One, this car fits my style. Two, this car is not locked. Three, I want to imitate Mr. Bean! Is there another option? Yes, take a bus! Are your mothers in there? Shut up and follow them! We will have an answer. Keep watch on these two. Don't let them in. If they stop me when I come out, you take action. Sister Hua, they have guns! Be alert. Got a lot of free time, huh? What a scene! This calls for a celebration! Come! All right! Cheers! Did you capture that tomboy? Not yet. But she's injured, can't go far. I pity her. She's after all a woman. One saying goes, man fears a wrong job, woman fears a wrong husband. She has got both wrong! She has a sissy husband, and is a gang leader! She is doomed. Bottoms up! That tomboy is really naive. She thinks a soccer match can resolve all our grievances? It's not that easy! And she really didn't bring any weapons! Very obedient! She must have studied in Singapore! Why? Singaporeans are very obedient! My hat's off to you. We agreed no weapons, yet you brought weapons! Watch your words! Those are not weapons, they are fruits! Durians are fruits, sugar canes are fruits too! Didn't you learn? Which school were you from? Petaling Street International University! Cheers! Yes? Has the game ended? Half bets tonight. Rooney is not on field! Twenty thousand? Talk to my men then! That's it! Those two outside are killed. Those inside will suffer an ugly death! Oh no, my wife! I have to save her! You are good in dancing, not fighting. You better stay here! What are you doing? Can't you tell? I want you to die! Why! If you are dead, the territories in Singapore and Malaysia will be mine! I want to thank you for tricking that tomboy. I thought we were in this together? Why are you doing this? Do you think I sacrificed so many lives to share the benefits with you? You think I'm dumb? You're more stupid than Hua! Go to hell! This sword was a gift from Japan's Yakuza group two years ago. I had never used it. Since you have helped me, I will make an exception for you! Stop! Li Hua, you're still young, you'll get bullied. I did all this for you. Do you know that? Do you know me after all these years? Damn! You really don't know me well. Look at you, how can I hand Shao He Gang to you? You scum! You sacrificed our brothers to be the leader again. You're worse than a beast! Shut up! If you back off, I may miss the shot. No matter how fast you are, you can't be faster than my bullet! Goodbye! Dear! Don't be afraid, I have a gun! Take it out! Dear! Back off! I said back off! I am warning you, I have a gun, just can't fire! Who doesn't have a gun? Mine is a real gun! Mine is a real gun too! My gun is loaded! You are scared now? Fire! Shoot! Bring it on, I am not afraid! Don't move if you have guts! Thought you were brave? Take cover! Damn it! Dear, I really have a gun! Where is it? Here! - Careful! - Where? Take the metal one, not the flesh one! Where? The metal one! He's escaped! It's hot! Still burning! Kiddo, which gang are you from? Why did you kidnap us? Who the hell are you? When you're together as a gang, you call the shots. When you are alone, you are just like us. Helpless. What do you want? All of us here, our family were tortured by loan sharks. Consider what you've done for money, you're worse than a beast. Jail and whipping will only make you more heroic. Kiddo, how dare you hurt my family. You better release us now. I can still turn a blind eye and forgive you. Release us now! Damn it! Do you remember me? You've harmed too many people, I don't think you can remember. Even you can't remember me? Stupid kid! One more word from you and I will make sure I break your limbs. Make you crippled! Damn! What do you want? What do you want exactly? Silence! Today, you watch what I do and say! Any retaliation, I will burn your mothers! Like the way you burn down our houses! Hey! No! Stupid kid! That's my mother! I'm warning you! Don't hurt my mother! Don't harm my mother! Damn you! Are you still a human? How can you bully a helpless girl? She is innocent! You want revenge? Come to me! Damn you! Your members always terrorize those innocent and helpless. Do you know that? These victims are not your loved ones, you don't feel a thing. I pleaded with you before, and you ignored my pleas. You continued to beat my father, and forced my mother to death! I remember you now. Do you know how it feels to witness your parents dying in front of you? Do you know how I felt? Don't worry, you will feel that soon! Kiddo! You've gotten the wrong person. But I am magnanimous, I won't take it to heart. Hey! I didn't use any bad words. I am already very polite, why still splash paint on me? I am not a wall! Why me only when there are four of us? You know why? Because you earn the most dirty money! You splashed countless buckets of paint, I only splashed you three. You think I don't know you, Chen Jun! Here, you have asked your brothers to harm countless families. You are the mastermind! Mother! Hey, don't hurt my mother! My brothers hurt your family, it's my fault! Leave the innocents alone! I'm the leader, I'm responsible! That's right! She is the real leader! The mastermind of the gang! Kiddo, target her and her mother! Don't do this! I am kind to tell you! I'm a good man! I don't kill! I do good! Hey! Don't do this! I am kind enough to tell you. What are you doing? I'm really a good man! I just asked my daughter to free a fish. I'm a good man! Hear me out! Kiddo, I'm not lying! Kiddo, don't be rash, I'm innocent! Hey! How can you treat me this way? One. Please don't do this! No! Two. Wait! If you kill my father now, he won't live to see me suffer. Kill me first! Don't do that! Please don't do that! I beg you! She is innocent! She is really innocent! No! Daddy let you down! My precious! Three! Shocked? How did you feel? Is your daughter still alive? Do you know why I didn't harm your mother and daughter? They are innocent! Look at your past evil doings, what goes around, comes around! These photos prove your crimes. The judge should decide your fate! Blood is strange. You made someone bleed, they will make you bleed too. Blood is evil. If it starts bleeding, it won't stop. Look at the Americans and terrorists, they want to kill each other. Makes the world chaotic! We're talking about loan sharks, why did I divert the subject? My wife is arrested. I am a lonely man, it's tough! Oh God! Ten years of loneliness? CHEN JUN - DEATH SENTENCE LI HUA - TEN YEARS SENTENCE EMPEROR - EIGHT YEARS SENTENCE SOLDIER HEAD - EIGHT YEARS SENTENCE By then, my engines will be spoilt. TEN YEARS LATER Who are you? Your husband! My husband is not like this. My wife is not like this! You've put on weight. Before God entrusts you with a mission... Your endurance will be tested. I lied! I hadn't changed! Flowers for you, I bought them from the market. Let's go! The jail is not great! You're so cheeky! Did you suffer a lot in jail? Not too bad! You came alone? Dear, since you were arrested, I have stopped dancing. The gang decided to do legal businesses. But they will only listen to you. They want to wait for you to come back. Wait for me? Sister Hua!
