JERUSALEM, I CENTURY The council has long heard talk about your girls. Yes, we know how to impress people... Even the honorable Caiaphas told me about you. My lord Gabrias. BARABBAS Barabbas! Barabbas! Do you hear me? What is it? They’ve forgotten us! They haven’t brought us food since early morning. I’m going to starve. I’m amazed we’re still alive. It’s Passover now, you know. Barabbas, you remember the Passover tradition? The people choose a prisoner to set free. By the God of my fathers, I didn’t murder that Pharisee. I didn't kill him! Just a little gold, that’s what I wanted. A whole day without food! If no one comes I’m going to starve! You’re keeping quiet, Barabbas? I’m dying here! Barabbas? Barabbas? Why aren’t you saying anything, Barabbas? Why did you kill that Pharisee, Gabrias? Everything he said was true. Your Judith is... Gestas! Say her name again and I’ll tear your arms off! I'll kill you, Gestas! I'll kill you! I'll kill you, Gestas! FRIDAY Crucify him! Crucify him! Crucify him! What wrong has he committed? Crucify him! It would be good to execute him. This traitor’s no friend of Caesar... You have brought this man to me. What accusation do you bring against him? He’s a blasphemer! What do you think? Doesn’t he deserve to die? You’re in a generous mood, Pilate. Your lord Caesar won’t reproach you for being too strict! But if blasphemy isn't a crime, what about treason? Witnesses swear that he opposed paying tribute to Caesar. You’re not answering me. Or do you not hear what people accuse you of? What’s the matter, Pilate? Go and give your sentence. This man said he is king of the Jews. You know well there is no king but Caesar. Are you the king of the Jews? Are you speaking for yourself about this, or did others tell you this concerning me? Your people and your high priests brought you to me. My kingdom is not of this world... Are you... a king then? You say it! Where is Iscariot? You said Judas Iscariot led the guard to the Nazarene’s hiding place. That young man fled the city in fear. We don’t know to where. Strange... I find no fault in him at all, I will release him. No fault?! Have you gone mad, Pilate? The crowd will tear you apart for such rashness! Plus, they are asking you to set Barabbas free. I’ve ordered him brought here, he awaits his release. He’s waiting in vain! I swear by all gods of Rome that he will be crucified. Didn’t he kill one of your Pharisees, Gabrias, a learned and distinguished man? Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him. Your loving wife, Justitia. I have questioned this man, but I find no fault in him worthy of death! No, we don’t want him. Barrabas! But you have a custom that I should release someone to you. Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews? Not this man, but Barabbas! Barabbas! Where is Barabbas? Bring him here. Did you murder the Pharisee Gabrias? Yes! And I’d kill again if there’s another such liar in this city! You hear what he’s saying? Do you want to free such a man? Does he really deserve forgiveness? My good Pilate, you don’t know the whole truth. Gabrias was distinguished but had an evil tongue. He slandered the girl Barabbas loved. These are trifles you shouldn’t bother with, Caiaphas. Whatever reason he had, the crime remains. Who do you want me to release, the killer Barabbas, or Jesus called the Christ? Barabbas, Barabbas! We have our law, he should die for calling himself the Son of God! Truly, Pilate, your indecision will cause a riot. Bring me some water. Barabbas, Barabbas! I am innocent of this just man's blood, you see! Barabbas! Free Barabbas! Rejoice, Barabbas! Won’t you place these chains on the Nazarene? Who knows when he’ll be executed. He could suddenly escape! Come now, did he resist the guard? He does not challenge his sentence. He meekly accepted the sentence you demanded. What are you waiting here for? Go away! Your people’s law has released you to go kill and plunder freely. You heard the prefect, get out of here! This man is not guilty! I’m telling you all, this man is not guilty! Forgive my interruption, but I wanted to pay my respects, to salute the people’s chosen one. This is Melchior! Keep on his good side! They say he has power over demons! Great Barabbas! Don’t deny me your friendship. I don’t know this man and I don’t care for his greeting. I love honesty and you, Barabbas, are honest! Indeed, I am Melchior, as your friend said, but I have no power over demons. This is how I imagined you: dressed outwardly like a king, inside lowliest poverty! Come with me, wash yourself of the prison dirt! I live here, in this inn. Upstairs you can dress lavishly, to worthily meet the one you love. Freed just now... I won’t be a slave again! I won’t insist on my invitation. Do as you like. Don’t follow me, follow your own wish! It’s a crime to execute an innocent man! It’s no crime if the people want it. It’s always a pleasure for sinners to kill one without sin. Let Simon carry the cross! Carry it, Simon! Let him carry the Nazarene’s cross! He bragged he’s as strong as four men! Yes! Let him carry the cross. That’s a job fit for a man of Cyrene. Show your strength! Look, there she is! The silken cloak of a flower whose scent drives you crazy. Let me go! I swear on my soul, I’ll kill you! Don’t swear by your soul, friend. Strange as it may be, you have one! Control yourself and don’t shrug off my friendship, it will be very useful to you. This the first pain you might have felt now, today... A few steps more and we’ll see everything... Gestas! Gestas! You? You, Barabbas? Are you walking free? Justice! I demand justice! Grab Barabbas and crucify him! Get a cross... Die a brave death if you’ve a drop of courage in your veins! And calm down about Barabbas! He’s been lawfully freed and pardoned! Pardoned... Pardoned... Pardoned... Judith... Judith! Don’t you recognize me? It’s me, Barabbas! You’re Barabbas? No, it’s impossible! This morning I saw him before Pilate, half-naked, yet he looked more noble than you! Why are you mocking me? It’s me, Barabbas! Was it not because of you I was in prison? How dare you say that! I’ll have you whipped for such impertinence! You forget your sins too easily. Is this how you greet me, Judith? This time I forgive you! Just please let go of my hand. Look how you’ve hurt me! Gabrias would have kissed this hand! Gabrias!? What does it have to do with him? What does it have to do with Gabrias? What does it have to do with Gabrias? Sinner! Here’s the sinner that mad prophet associated with. The harlot Magdalene. She ought to be driven from here with stones. Yes, she should be driven from everywhere you go, lovely Judith. But it’s impossible: the woman with her is the Nazarene’s mother. The law must go hand in hand with charity. She might look on his trials with tears, me with laughter. He sowed discord in my family. He turned my brother’s heart from me, made him a slave to his teachings. I deeply sympathize with your grief for Judas. But be comforted with the thought that all will be well, quench your thirst for revenge. Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do! Simon! Simon of Cyrene, where are you? Lend us a hand with something. People of Jerusalem! Bend your knees and pray! Don't be afraid. You are the chosen people of the Lord! We have angered him harboring this lying prophet from Galilee. Judith! Judith! Judith! - Is that you, Caiaphas? - No, it’s me, Barabbas! Barabbas, you have always been brave, save me! - Get me out of this darkness. - I can’t, Judith. The whole world is wrapped in darkness, I can’t see the city. What? Coward! In the city you can start a fire, fight this darkness. If you loved me, you’d take me out of here. But you don’t love me! You don’t want to get out of this accursed place that the Nazarene’s sorcery brought darkness on! Wait. I’ll go. I’ve already sinned for you once, a second time hardly matters! But I beg you, don’t mention the Nazarene again. Who are you to tell me what to do? You who stole a pearl just because I liked it! You killed Gabrias only because he loved me! Tell me the truth, did you love Gabrias? I don’t love anyone! All men love me! You’re talking about only one man! Do you want to be the only one? Let’s go. Barabbas, get me out of here. I’ll give you love to last a long time. Don’t tempt me. Go alone! It makes me sick that I ever loved you! You don’t want my love, you won’t be my servant?! Just die then! Who’s crying? Who’s crying? Answer me! I may be a sinner, but my heart is ready to weep with yours! Quiet. Calm down and pray. Don’t be afraid! Get on your knees with us, the darkness will pass, day is near! It is finished! Now no man should fear death! Let’s leave dead Christ to the tears of the women who loved him. We men have played our part, we killed him! Well now, did you find your Judith in the dark? Yes, found her... and lost her! Never has a loss been so good. You can’t control your passion. You’re a symbol of your tribe, like the Nazarene symbolized a new faith! I don’t understand you. You always speak in parables! It’s a custom of the East. I’ll explain this parable another time. Now let’s hurry. Night is falling. There is more to be done to amaze the world. What do you want from me? You must be Peter... Better I were anyone else than me! What do you know of the man from Nazareth? Don’t cry for the Nazarene, his suffering is over. He’s dead! You don’t know the whole story! What’s done is done, Peter. I know your repentance’s as great as your sin. But you're still less a sinner than your pal Judas. Don’t mention Judas. He could at least die, but I’m a coward! I’m still alive! Die? What are you saying? Judas isn't dead! If you don’t believe me, come see! You’ll find him near Gethsemane, the place he betrayed his teacher. He hangs from a bare branch. He killed himself last night. Judith! Her brother’s dead. How will she bear that? Who will tell her? Who? I will. Let her be cursed! She drove her brother to suicide. She made him betray his teacher! How do you know that Judith is to blame? It was cleverly arranged to look like something good. Do you want the truth? Come with me, I’ll tell you everything. Judith was betrayal herself, but not Judas. There was no evil in him, I swear! Vanity, that’s what killed him. I’ve no doubt the Nazarene is divine, but we need proof from him that he’s God! It has been proven many times now, through many wonders. Not in Jerusalem, not before the priests and rulers. They don’t believe in your prophet from Galilee. If he truly has such power, you can give him an opportunity to rule the world. Make him prove his glory! If he is God, then we’ll worship him. You’ll show him your love and devotion! Our teacher is the Lord of heaven and earth. No one can harm him or take his glory away. What could I advise? What could I know? It seemed so natural and fair. I curse woman. Sin and death came only through her! Let her be cursed! Your curses are futile, Peter. Curse woman, when a woman bore your teacher on this earth? When the Nazarene’s mother has made woman a temple of the Almighty? Yet you cannot blame the betrayal solely on Judith Iscariot. She was only a tool for the true betrayer. Are you talking about Caiaphas? Yes, Caiaphas is the main culprit. But let it be no surprise. God was crucified by an arrogant man of God. How could that be? Judas did visit Caiaphas, but only after his decision was made. You don’t know the details, Peter. Have you never heard of love between a man and a woman? That passion existed between Caiaphas and Judith. Don’t object, Barabbas, for it is true. For her help, she got gold and jewels from him. Women like her prize those more than virtue. Tell me about your dream. You really want to know? It won’t bother you? No, rather it would calm me. Since I got your message, your deed has troubled me. It’s not like you! I thought I could warn you. If dreams... truly augur truth... you face unheard-of horror. Don’t worry about me, Justitia. Believe me, no fate looms but death, no one can escape it. Tell me what you saw. The Nazarene. The Nazarene. I dreamed of him, wrapped in glory! I sent the note to warn you. Of what? Yes, he was righteous. But don’t you realize, the righteous always suffer? That’s not all. The rest concerns your fate, Pilate. My fate? Whatever it is, I think I am strong enough to bear it. I know. I know you are strong, otherwise you wouldn’t be a Roman! But... to die like Iscariot... Iscariot? The gods... might reproach you... for your cowardice, Pilate. What are you saying, Justitia? You dare call me a coward? If you saw... the Nazarene possessed... supernatural glory... if you saw God in a man... you had to... proclaim the truth before all the people. They wouldn’t believe me. They’d think me crazy, condemn me as a madman... Caesar would dismiss me... from my office. Any loss would come easily, but your conscience would be clean. Who could have suspected such a plan? If you knew and were in Jerusalem, stranger, why didn’t you warn us? What use could my words be? You didn’t believe your teacher, but you’d believe me? It all happened quickly. The law came down on us like a storm. We weren’t brave or strong enough to resist. We all scattered. Only I followed my teacher to Caiaphas’s house! And I... denied him! When Caiaphas’s men called me his disciple, I said I didn’t know that man. It was true, I thought I knew God and not a man. You’re a sophist, Peter. You try in vain to justify your actions! If you really knew God, you’d never deny Him. In actual faith, you thought him an earthly king. With time he might rule Jerusalem! That was your dream! You killed the Christ. - What more do you want from Pilate? - My lady... You’re a Jew, so you also took part in this murder? Noble Justitia, in God’s name, don’t count me among the criminals of my people. To save that innocent man, I’d gladly give my own life. I was his disciple, though I kept it hidden. So you... recognize him as God? If God ever lived on earth, then it is him! So, he’s still alive. Could God die? My lady, as far as mortal eyes and reason judge, life has left him. If your words are true, councilor, what could you possibly want? Just my simple duty to the departed. Outside the city is a dug tomb. It was meant as my grave, but if I could lay the Lord there, I’d happily take a worse plot. I’ve come to get Pilate’s agreement. I will remain forever obliged to Rome’s mercy. Sadly... I cannot give permission. But I’ll see if Pilate might talk to you. I sought Judas all last night in vain. Finally, I walked towards Gethsemane. Let’s go, quicker! He has been alone for a long time. We’ll bring him home. Judith must be waiting. Will she be happy when she sees him now? Come... Closer... Are you Joseph of Arimathea? I am, my lord. What do you want from me? Esteemed prefect, I came to ask... for the Christ’s body. The Christ’s body. Did you hear that, Justitia! The Christ’s body! Yes, I ask the Christ’s body. I wish to bury him on my plot with tears and prayers, like they bury dead heroes. You want to bury... the Christ? Yes. On your plot? Is your plot... grand? My lord... Don't deny this just man... I beg you... Forgive me, councilor. You are a councilor, you must have pity for the wayward, wisdom for the weak. You wish to bury the Nazarene? Yes. Let it be so! Take what you think his mortal body. I’ll let you give him an honest burial. Go! Your request is granted! Make way, let me through! You’re a traitor, Pilate! You conspire with traitors! Who do you call a traitor? A subject of Rome? You may be chief priest, but you’ll answer to Caesar for insulting his prefect. You’ll also answer to Caesar if you participate in this trick. The Galilean charlatan said he’ll rise on the third day. That councilor asks for his body to hide it on the second night. Then he’ll say that he is risen! You must stop it! I know you fear even the body of the man you killed. But the Arimathean got my permission. If you suspect him of something, place your seal on the tomb and a guard. Let them guard the tomb until 3 days pass. That will be fair for everyone. Enough. But if you were wise, Pilate, you wouldn’t give the councilor that criminal’s body. Examine the tomb to see if there’s a secret entrance. I won’t stop you. I wish you health, Pilate. Thank you, priest. I wish you more courage. - My lady, my lady! - What is it? My lady, I dare not say. But please, come with me. Your father calls you... Judas! He came back? Father! Judas! Judas! Why did you bring him home wrapped up? Is he unconscious? Judas! Wake up! Why are you scaring me? Look, they killed him! The Nazarene’s disciples killed him! Caiaphas! Where is Caiaphas? We must tell him to catch the murderers! Loosen the rope. He can’t breathe! Look, his blood is flowing. Life has returned at my touch! Look! Life is still moving in him... Father! This is your doing, Nazarene! Your sorcery worked. You’ve won, you have been avenged! I thank you for the sad service you did for me. Don’t be upset if I now ask you to leave me. My grief is greater than my strength. My soul grieves, I am tired. Still thinking of your lost Judith’s beauty? I admit, I’ve never seen a more beautiful woman. Why do you talk about her beauty? - Better think of Judas. - The whole world will think of him. History will blame him for a sin he didn’t do alone. But in people’s books, not God’s. You don’t think his sin will be forgiven? Not by the world that pushed him to it. But God’s love is boundless. Judas’s trembling soul can find refuge in it. Judas, finally you can breathe... Please, get up, talk to me. It’s me, your little sister you love so. What have I done to you? I only gave you good advice. Caiaphas... could do much for you, if you just showed a little repentance. Judas, talk to me! Why be so upset the traitor was executed? Will this be a reason for us to quarrel? Judas! Judas! Judas! You’ve fallen asleep again, without saying a word! You don’t want to look at me! I won’t bother you. I’ll wake you when morning comes. I’ll come back to gaze on you, my dear, gloomy brother. Good night. I’ll just bring good news from Caiaphas. SATURDAY What are you doing here, miserable Jew. Go away, don’t bother the Romans. Sir, I don’t ask alms. I wish only permission to place my hand on this tomb. Once, just once, sir? My girl is very sick... Girl? What girl? How does touching a stone help? Get out of here! Sir, she’s only 3 years old. She’s sick. I believe if I place my hand on that stone, her sickness will pass. Please, sir... Come on, old fool. Just keep in sight. I’ll let you touch the tomb, but let it be a short prayer. Lord! If you only will it, you can save my girl. Just say the word and she will be healed. My sincere thanks, sir. May God reward your kindness. You think this grave works miracles? Sir, I know nothing of God’s mysteries, but I believe my girl is saved. May God be with you, soldier. May he guide your spear and keep you! May God be with you, soldier. My girl is saved... I must get some air. The heat inside is unbearable. I’ll ask where the Nazarene is buried and go there. Why? You don’t believe in him, so why go? I don’t know. Something draws me. If I don’t believe in him as God, it’s only because what I’ve heard of him troubles me. Even what you said. My soul rejects what my mind cannot understand. If you reject what you don’t understand, you must reject the whole universe. Can you grasp how light enters dry seed to make it grow? Or how as a drop of water or dust it turns simple things into diamonds, worthy of a queen? You don’t understand simple natural phenomena. Nature’s only the outer reflection of the mind of God... Go your own way in seeking truth, but if you cannot reach it, don’t blame the real truth, blame your lowly mind that cannot comprehend it. Is this... the belief of Egypt? No, it is not belief, it is knowledge. Knowledge attained through belief. I don’t know who you are, but your words are bold. You have been more than generous to me. Tell me, can I do something for you in the city? Yes, deliver a message. Barabbas, if you go to the Nazarene’s tomb, don’t argue with the guards, so they cannot accuse you of trying to steal the body. The Nazarene did vow he’d raise on the third day, tomorrow. He will rise! Rise? Come alive from the tomb? That’s impossible! If death is perishing, it’s impossible. But if death is life? Are you standing good guard, centurion? No one has doubted my vigilance. You haven’t heard any sounds? From the tomb? No, I haven’t heard the voice of the deceased. How was the night? No one disturbed you? Sir, one might count you among those who think he’ll rise again. I have heard much about your fine service. Live up to those rumors, and your name will be praised to Caesar. Farewell! Mary! Please, listen to me. You know who I am. I should have died yesterday instead of your son. I swear, I’d happily die, but... I realized it too late! They say your son blasphemed, he called God his Father. But rumors claim he really was the son of God Almighty! You alone know the secret of his birth. Mary! Please, have mercy on the world and tell the truth. Tell me, who was your son’s father? Mary! Why don’t you answer? I will believe whatever you say. Tomorrow! Don’t judge me, Mary! I’m only seeking the truth! This is the custom. I must say, Caiaphas, I see no reason to erase him from history. You’re a slave to your narrow views! The rumors are getting louder and louder. The entire Sanhedrin will be accused of a cruel murder and that criminal will be turned into a miserably martyr! Want a man to have glory forever? Just let rumors about him fly. You’ve lost the calm you had earlier, Caiaphas. Impudent servant! If you keep Jesus of Nazareth’s name in the chronicles, I’ll tear your parchment to pieces, and you will be dismissed. Don’t be angry, Caiaphas, I won’t disobey your order. We’ll consign... the “King of the Jews”... to oblivion, then. That’s better. What the pen doesn’t write, the eye cannot read. Caiaphas! Caiaphas! I cannot forgive the old man who prayed for his granddaughter. I met him in the city, he shook with joy. He swore the fever had left the child. Yes, the superstition of the lowly is boundless. By all gods of Rome, this night is fit for sound sleep. Judith! What are you doing here? Where were you? Why have you come here alone? Caiaphas? You’re the first priest, but your love for me turned you into a slave. Let us leave here. They might see us. Let everyone see! I don’t care! Judas is still mad at me. He thinks I caused the Nazarene’s death, but you did. You alone! You must tell him that! - Galbus, Maximus! - What? - Why did you leave your post? - I left Fadias there. I wanted you to hear it... Some kind of bird is singing. There, it’s starting again. You can’t hear a bird without running to talk about it? Go back to your post! And you too, Maximus. Did you forget today we must be extra vigilant? I’ve decided to hide there tonight. If a miracle happens, I’ll be witness to it. Watch out. When the teacher comes, let him not catch you sleeping! I saw the lightning turn into a glorious crown. But darkness suddenly shrouded everything. I lost sight of Judas. Barabbas found him then and brought him home. - Barabbas? - Barabbas is a murderer. You should be a friend to him. Didn’t you kill the Nazarene? This cross has miraculous power. Come, let’s wake Judas. He has been sleeping a long time. Will you confide in Judas? Comfort him? The crime that tortures him, was our work! Calm down, I’ll say what I can. I don’t believe you. Swear by this sign. How dare you mock me! You won’t be tricking me any more! Galbus, Galbus! Look, the dawn! It is blinding! Galbus, bow down! The gods are coming down to earth! SUNDAY He is risen! Christ is risen! What? What happened?! He is risen, risen! the stone is rolled from the tomb. He’s risen! Have you gone mad! Where are you running to? To there! We should gather all the disciplines. Go, watch the place the Lord laid. No one will stop you! He is risen! Christ is risen! Where did he go? Tell me, where? He is risen. Tell me, what are you doing here? If the Romans saw me, they’d swear I came to steal the body... Your friends ran off shouting that he’s risen! Contribute your charming voice, then the whole world will take it as the divine truth! What’s the matter, Barabbas? Why do you make yourself sad at such a happy time? You must be blind to miss the cunning plot laid by a woman’s love! You go your way, Maria! I don’t believe he’s risen! Go, Mary! Hurry to bring the news to those who should hear it. Though no one, even the repentant Peter will believe you. You’re well awake, friend Barabbas... Greetings, Romans! What happened to your centurion? We do not answer the questions of strangers. Be respectful, young soldier, and obey Caesar’s seal. Forgive me, sir. In these parts every Roman must be careful. Yes, and well awake, like you last night. Of course, nothing of note happened? Sir, I could say much about last night. But I think I should tell all to Judea’s overlords. Rome did not kill the Nazarene. The prefect publicly disavowed blame for his death. Where are you off to now? To Pilate, then Caiaphas. I’ll tell them all I know. If you’re Caesar’s friend, sir, please don’t judge us! I’ll swear to a judge, the whole Sanhedrin, that no one Jew or Roman can oppose divine forces! Don’t worry, soldier! You won’t lose your rank or Caesar’s favor. Show this mute centurion to Caiaphas, tell him everything. Don’t be surprised if it’s soon replaced by a lie. Farewell! If you need a worker, take me. But if you don’t need my effort, I’m unable to repay you. Friend Barabbas, you owe me nothing. I owe you. I’ve gained much for studying your character. What could you do for me? Carry water or plow earth, all sorts of slavish tasks? - I could do it! - Stop! I won’t ruin your future. Take my advice, go to Rome. I’ll fill your purse with gold, become an usurer there. Loan Caesar funds for his whims, mistresses, wars. Lend freely, at high interest. Get rich and live honestly, no one will ask if you were a thief or a murderer. Open, open up. It’s me, Mary. Come with me, I found Judith Iscariot! She is in Gethsemane, sick and mad. Maybe you’ll convince her to leave there. I couldn’t do it. Hurry, Barabbas. When grief falls upon you, forget the past. No need to be so stubborn, Caiaphas. You don’t want to describe your assailant? The weapon found nearby will help find him. What weapon? Bring it here, I want to see it. Leave me alone. Everyone except my wife. Rachel, come here. Have you seen this before? Yes. It’s Judith Iscariot’s dagger, a gift from the late Gabrias. Yes, you’re right! Last evening she came to me. She wounded me. Take this and throw it into the well. I feel I can rely on you. Poor Judith! You feel sorry for her? With all my heart. Then know that I loved her. You hear? I loved her! I was unfaithful to you for her! I hear you, Caiaphas, and I know. And you’ve nothing to say? You don’t care? I’ve nothing to say, for I feel nothing. Who’d suffer at the loss of love as pathetic as yours? How dare you speak so disrespectfully to me? I dare, Caiaphas, because you wronged me. I’m grateful to Judith, she tried to save the world from you! It’s just a pity she didn’t succeed! Wait here. I’ll go alone and talk to her. Judas! Finally you’ve come! I’ve searched the whole city for you. I even killed Caiaphas for you! He was a traitor. I realized too late and couldn’t save the Nazarene. You aren’t angry at your little sister? Will you love her just as before? You’re not Judas! How dare you come here? Leave me alone. I must gather flowers for my grave... - Judith... - for I am dead. Judas will come at sunset and take me with him. Stay if you want, just send this stranger away. Let’s go to those trees, sit and sing something! Judas’s still mad at me, and this bothers me. And here's what comforts me. Caiaphas broke the same one, and I killed him for it. Stay with me until Judas comes. I’ll stay with her. Follow us, then run to her father and bring him here. Let's go! Caiaphas! Caiaphas! Pilate sent you his people. The guard has been removed, the tomb’s open... Cowards! Thieves! They dare not say the man from Nazareth is risen! If his body is gone, then they stole it! Where are those cursed Romans? Sir, I sense I came at a bad time, but I must obey orders. Pilate sent me to say the guard’s vigilance was in vain. Heavenly powers interfered, a miracle occurred: the Nazarene is risen! Cowardly Roman, how dare you bother me with such fables! Plus, it wasn’t you in charge. It was Galbus, head of all you scoundrels. Let him speak! Priest, sir, you have got too fired up. You’ve forgotten Judea is a Roman province, you pay Caesar tribute. As for Galbus, I wish your or my order could make him speak! If you are mute, then speak with gestures. If you can speak, then speak. Who stopped your watch, who took away your Roman courage? Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of the Living God! Shut him up! Kill him! I’ll answer for it before Caesar! May you all be cursed! Everyone get out of here! I'll speak with you through Pilate. Don’t doubt that justice will prevail. Whoever broke the tomb’s seal will be punished most severely! Follow the angels, then, and you’ll find the path to salvation! - Get out! - Follow me! What do you want? Can’t you see Caiaphas’s in no mood for more of your nonsense! I want to tell him something. Maybe this will be evidence for him. This soldier wants to tell you something, Caiaphas. Leave me alone. Sir, this morning when we left the tomb, we met a man. He asked how our night went. He had a ring with Caesar’s seal. Barabbas was with him. Barabbas? Barabbas, sir! That criminal! Thank you, you did well to tell me. Come back later and you’ll get some gold. All of your comrades who met Barabbas will get gold. On the condition that you tell the city everything. That’s Barabbas, who was freed in our teacher’s stead. He has repented of his sins. Greetings, friend! Do you know, the crucified one has risen from the dead? Do you really believe he is risen? Of course! We’ll going to Bethany, then Galilee, as our teacher bid us. He promised to meet us along the way. Maybe you’ll come with us? You too can meet the risen Lord. From your words, you still haven’t seen him. You heard it from Magdalene and believed her story of a miracle. We were there, we saw the grave... Why? You doubted his resurrection? Are you sure you’d recognize him if you met on the road? Would we recognize him? I swear we’d recognize him out of a million. Careful Peter, don’t swear. You have already denied him thrice. Thank you for offering friendship, but I cannot join you. I’d sooner follow Judas than walk your path. Break bread with the runaway disciples of the sinless Nazarene? You said yourselves, you doubted. If you believe him God, then why did you all abandon him? Forgive me for being frank. I wish you a good journey. If you meet your Lord... may your eyes have love... to recognize him. Where? Where? Where is the King? I must see him, I must beg him to forgive Judas. Good sir, don’t be angry. I have sinned greatly and shown no mercy. But for my brother’s sake, I must find the King! Maybe he will forgive me! If you’re asking about the man you helped the priests to crucify, then it’s in vain. He will appear on earth no more to people like you! How do you know that, Peter? You have no mercy. Our teacher was merciful. Your teacher has strange disciples. They forgive only their own sins. Quiet, quiet, can’t you see the change that came over her? Look! How could you not find him. Here is the King! NAZARETH, 7 DAYS LATER Are you Joseph the carpenter? Jacob’s son, of the house of David, and... father of the so-called King of the Jews? Yes, I am Joseph. I am Barabbas. I should have been crucified instead of your son, for... I was a thief and murderer, but he was innocent. If you only knew all my torment! I... I talked to his mother, your wife. I begged her for the secret of his birth, but... but she remained silent. You are his father. You have known him since his very birth! Joseph... Please answer me! What could I tell you, except this divine man was not my son. Not your son? Is Mary not your wife? Do you have no children? None that call her mother. I have children, but from my first wife who died. Mary I knew only as a chosen one. I was to guard her purity. I don’t understand what you mean. Didn’t you marry her? Wasn’t Jesus born of Mary?! She was yours, after all. She has never been mine, not in glance or touch. Angels were friends to her, they sang and set a star on night the child was born. I was only her faithful servant. I don’t get it. You knew Mary would give birth. If he isn’t your son, then whose is he? You hear me? Whose son is he?! Whose?! Whose son is he? In the name of God Almighty who made us! I only saw a dream... Look, look there! There he is! Ask him what no mortal can explain to you! Aren’t you Barabbas? Hey, you there! Come here! Here’s the man we want! What happened? Don’t you know the people’s will set me free? What new crime am I being accused of? Attempted murder of first priest Caiaphas. And helping the Nazarene’s disciples steal his body. For all that you’ll probably be executed. Is it Caiaphas who accused me? Caiaphas denounced you to Pilate and demands your death. Friend, whatever my fate, I am ready for it. In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, I would go happily to death. That’s already enough to have you executed! Back again, Barabbas? You’ve been free only days, but you’re so vile you did wrong again?! Please, don’t act so towards me, you’ve no reason to be angry. This time I am not guilty. But I was unjustly freed. Now I am ready to atone for my former crime. For those words I won’t disturb the last hours of your life. You won’t suffer from hunger and thirst. I can’t do anything more for you. Where am I? Where have I come to? To a shelter from the storm. Rest now and rejoice! Lord! I am not worthy! I should have died on the cross, not You. Whoever believes in Me shall never die. Enter into eternal life. I’ll answer for him and defend him myself in court. You sound determined. You do carry Caesar’s seal and Caiaphas did allow you to meet Barabbas, but that won’t stop the wheels of the law. Perhaps not, but are Jerusalem’s lawmen so incorruptible? Barabbas! Barabbas! Barabbas! Barabbas! We won’t be arguing about Barabbas’s fate any more. Whatever crimes he did, they are forgiven him. A power higher than ours freed him. Bear him away with care. He’s dead. Are you... sad, Simon? Hard to leave the land God visited? Don’t weep. God is always with you. Now Golgotha belongs not just to Judea but the world. Yes, you are right in that, as in many other things. There... lies Barabbas, who I told you of. Despite the crowd’s roar to free him, he had not a friend in Jerusalem. I buried him myself. Man of Cyrene, you were granted strength to carry the cross. Thus you gained both faith and knowledge. But much time will pass... until people learn... this lesson. Why must a long time pass? Did you quickly recognize Christ? Or you possess secrets different than other men? If I admitted that, it would be false boasting. But I’ll tell you one thing. In my youth I was a king. When Christ was born in Bethlehem, I had a vision. An angel said to me, “Arise, Melchior. Be the first king to give up his kingdom. Go to Bethlehem in Judea. There you’ll find God as a newborn, heir of the world. He will unite all peoples and join mankind with heaven through his eternal Name.” SCREENWRITER AND DIRECTOR EVGENY YEMELIN BASED ON THE NOVEL BARRABAS BY MARIE CORELLI, TRANSLATED BY KROPOTKINA IN 1900 PRODUCERS ANTON KIRILLOV EVGENY YEMELIN D.O.P.
