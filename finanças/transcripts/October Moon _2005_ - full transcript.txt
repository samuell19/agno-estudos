(zapping) (somber music) (water running) - [Speaker] My mother always said you should appreciate what God gives you. Because he can take it back at any moment, you have lost it forever. I never listened. (door creaking) - [Jake] Corin your mom just called and left a message on the answering machine. Something about dinner at your grandmothers. - Wow, you're actually cleaning up after your own mess. - Yeah well I got tired of waiting for you to do it for me. (smacking) Ah, shit! So why haven't you called her back? - I told her after five years it's time she realized you're not going away. - [Jake] Aw. (kissing) Really doesn't bother me. I mean, she'll accept it when she's ready. My parents finally came around and now they call to talk to you more than they do me. - [Corin] Well I am cuter. - [Jake] Shut up Mary. - [Corin] I'm just happy that I'm the one who's got ya. - [Jake] Forever. (lightening crashing) - Love me Jake. Jake. (screaming) (door opening) Jake? You okay? - Oh god, it's embarrassing. - Screaming like an LA queen? - You always know how to make me feel better. (lightening cracking) (eerie music) (birds chirping) - [Jake] Any reason why you didn't come to bed last night? - I didn't think you wanted me there. - You know, fights work best when the other person comes at you with what they're thinking. - I just wish you'd spend some of the time with me that you're always spending with your friends. I mean, we're supposed to be in a relationship here, and actually doing things together. - So why don't you just come out to the club with us or something? - I don't always wanna hang out with us, I wanna hang out with you. - That's fine, but I'd rather be out than reliving my childhood through Blair and Tootie and Mrs. Garrett every night. - Alright, first of all, don't diss my girls. Especially Jo, we grew up together. Second, I'm too old to be out clubbing every night. (laughing) - Please Corin, you're only as old as you feel. - You're 23, I'm 30. That's haggard in gay years. - So what are you gonna be when you're 40? - Dead. - Alright then, I'll be sure to throw you a little funeral then. - You still gonna be around? - Why are you always so afraid that I won't be? - You just seem preoccupied with everything but me. (soft music) See now that, that makes me happy. Also make me happy to see you out looking for a job today. - I will. Nobody's hiring right now. - Well do the dishes at least. - I will, promise. - Alright. - After I go out to lunch with Maggie, but I will, I promise. - I was thinking about eating in tonight, should be back by seven. - Is it safe to come in? - You come in here Nanc. - Well you think that's bad. The Anderson account wants their new artwork by Wednesday. But I've got some good news too. - You finally found yourself attracted to a man who isnt't gay? - Oh please, I haven't had a date in eight months. Why ruin a good drought now? Besides I'm still shopping for a lipstick that doesn't smear so easily. - Yeah me too, not that I need it. - Are you about to qualify for regaining your virginity too? - Ah, a strapping young buck like myself, nothing in six months, it's not normal. - Well I have something that'll put a smile back on your face. - Vin Diesel in a sling? No, no, wait a minute, Cher's doing her third and final concert. - Nope, the big boys upstairs finally gave me permission to hire you an assistant. - Are you serious? There is a goddess. When do I get him? - Him? Isn't that kind of uh leaping to conclusions? I was thinking a busty blonde with killer legs, you know give your eyes something new to feast on. Maybe convert those tastes of yours. - Honey, the only fish I eat comes from the sea. I need some man candy around here. - Um hello, I just got in a sexual harassment suit, what should I do with it? - [Corin] You can file it under F, for forget it. - I'll see what I can do. I've got three guys coming in this afternoon. - Nanc, I'm gonna be at the studio all afternoon. - Oh calm down. You shouldn't be doing the hiring anyway. You know it doesn't look good preventing sexual harassment and all. Besides I want somebody that's gonna do some actual work around here, not just pose for you. - Hey Nanc, just a little bit cute? - Mh, how much do you worship me? - [Corin] Lots. - One half cup butter, three fourths cup sugar, three fourths cup all purpose flour, three tablespoons cocoa, an eight a teaspoon salt. (screaming) Dammit Elliot! - What? - Oh I hate it when you do that. You know I don't like being scared. Alright, what are you up to? - We can finally set a date. - What? - I got the job. (screaming and laughing) - Oh Elliot, the wedding. - Well give me a few days to get a couple pay checks together, but go ahead and send out those save the date cards. - Oh I don't know who to call first. I have to call my brother. Did you tell your mom yet? - Well no, I figured we could do that together. - Oh, she's gonna be so excited. - Yeah well it'll finally get her off my back, but we'll have to put up with those when am I gonna see the grandchildren lectures. (shrieking) - This is so wonderful. Oh, can we stop by the cemetery? I wanna tell my parents. - Sure. - Oh can we go to the store? I wanna pick up those new bridal magazines. The new ones are supposed to come in either today or tomorrow. - Okay. (Giggling) (soft music) (birds chirping) - So your mom wants to have that engagement party next weekend, so we better get started. Elliot. Earth to Elliot, come back to Marti, Marti calling. (snapping) - Oh, I'm sorry. - Are you sure you're okay? - Well, I think some gay guy was staring at me back at the store. - So? - Well I guess it just kinda freaked me out. - Well I don't think their bite's poisonous, so I don't think you have to worry. - You're right. He was just looking anyway. - (chuckling) Yeah, he was checking out the merchandise. (laughing) I didn't think they did that kind of stuff in the daylight. (sighing) - I'm so sorry. I completely fucking forgot. - [Corin] It's okay. - No, no, I'm really sorry. - It's alright, forgotten. It happens. You know if you're cheating on me I'm not gonna continue with a relationship. Do you want to see other people? Have sex with other pp? - Alright. As stupid as this sounds, I do think about having sex with other people. But I don't want to think about you having sex with other people. Do you want to have sex with other people? - We know plenty of people that are in open relationships. And they're perfectly happy with it. It's not for us. But if, it's something you're thinking about, I'll be willing to try it. - So if we do all this and we find someone else? - Then I guess we found the answer. - But you just said. (soft music) Why do you love me? - Because when you're not around and I think about you you know I still smile. Oh, this bites. - [Nancy] What's wrong sexy? - See for yourself. From the Anderson shit. - Oh. - Mh, deadline approaching - Yeah. - rapidly as well. - Well, I got some good news, it'll get that constipated look off your face. Are you into meeting your new assistant in an hour? - I love you. (giggling) Thank you. A boy? - Uhuh. - Cute? - Um, so so. - Family? - Possibly, but he's engaged to some girl. - Ugh, another classic case. - Oh Mr. Horny pants, you shouldn't be fraternizing with the staff anyway. - You know I still have those Xeroxes of your bare ass from the Christmas party? - Mh, yeah there's that. Anyway, his name's Elliot. I'm guessing he's a mama's boy. - Aren't we all. - He's eager to get to work, and he says he wants to learn more about the advertising business. So train him right, and he'll climb and scratch his way, and suck his way to the top, just like you did Ms. Berkeley. (hissing) - Watch that top step on your way out, okay? - Just be nice to him, alright. He's a tad nerdy, but I think he'll give you what you need. Speaking of, how did dinner go? - Late, again. (sighing) We had a good talk though, nothing really resolved but. - You know there's plenty of other hotties out there that would love to get down your pants. - Hmph, what the maintenance guy, 300 pounds, 60 years old, sweater on his back? - You know if they're rich and on their death bed I'll be their Anna Nicole. - Hm. - Hey sad face. - I'm just not interested in meeting anybody else, Nancy. I want him. - So what's the problem? - I'm John Denver, Enrico Caruso, Nora Jones, he's Britney Spears, Pink, No Doubt. - What about Madonna? - Oh, we're both Madonna. What good fag isn't? - Do you think maybe you're hanging on to a 23 year old just to maintain your own youth? - No, I was 25 when I met him. I certainly didn't have age issues then. - It'll all work out honey, something will happen, it'll snap him out of it, and he'll realize how lucky he is to have you. (serene music) - I don't know how to get this thing right. - Elliot calm down. I'll get to it in a moment. You think a boy your age would be able to do it all by himself by now. Are you sure that you're qualified to handle this job? - Thanks for the vote of confidence. - It's just that it's a big responsibility, Elliot. It's not some simple retail job. You have got to take this very seriously. You have a wedding to pay for. - Oh my god mom, I know. I think you want me to get married more than I do. - Now that is not true. I just want to make sure you don't lose Marti. It's a good thing you put that ring on her finger when you did. 'Cause I'm not gonna be around forever. And I know Marti will be good for you. I was already married 12 years at your age, and taking care of you. (sighing) Come here. There we go. - I wish that dad could come to the wedding. - You know I don't want that man anywhere near us. The only good thing he gave me was you. Before he ran off with that there. Now, you go downstairs before you're late for work. (knocking) - [Nancy] Corin do you have a minute? - Yeah, come on in. This is Elliot. - [Corin] Elliot how are you, nice to meet ya. Corin Buckman. - [Elliot] Hi. - [Nancy] Should I leave you two alone together or you want me to finish showing him the office? - You know I got to finish these contracts. Why don't you show him around the office and he can come back then, I'll show you what I need you to do for me, alright. - Elliot. - Oh, sorry, I'm just gonna follow her. - [Corin] So I hear you're engaged? - Yeah it's just to my girlfriend Marti. - Marti? - Everybody asks, she's named after her father. - Oh, nice family? - Actually they died in a boating accident a few years ago. Their bodies were never recovered. It's been a really hard time for her. They have memorial stones at the cemetery, but it's just not the same. All she has left is a younger brother. - God that's horrible. - I'm so sorry. Were you dating her at the time? - Yeah, we'd been together ever since high school. I never got along with a girl as well as I did with Marti. I never even looked at another girl. She's more than a girlfriend to me, she's more like my best friend. Oh what? - Nothing, nothing, Corin feels the same way about his other half. - So you have a girlfriend? - Actually Elliot I have a boyfriend, five and a half years. - Oh. I think that's cool. - They're having relationship issues right now though. - Which we're working out. - So uh, how did you, you know, know? - I guess when I was six or seven playing with Barbies and all the other boys were playing with superheroes. - [Nancy] You never played superheroes? - Well, Wonder Woman. Even started as Diana Prince and do the spin. - (laughing) You are such a fag. - I know. - So, how did your mother deal with all this? - She was hysterical, didn't really sink in 'til I smacked her wig off. (laughing) Uh, seriously she had a very hard time dealing with it. She blamed herself, not enough masculine influences in my life. - So where's your father? - I don't know, I haven't seen him since '86. - Wow, me either. Actually mines been longer, he's been gone since I was four. - My mother comes by every now and again, she's okay with Jake. - Who's Jake? - A pain in my ass. Ah, he's my boyfriend. You should come by with Marti some night, have dinner with us. - [Elliot] Yeah, I'd like that. - Ahem. So, inviting the little office boy home for dinner already? You home wrecking slut. - Whatever you saw how uptight he was, just thought it might relax him a little. - So is he one of you? - Oh, hell yeah. She screamed Mary the minute she walked in. - Why do you always refer to gay men as women? - Aren't we? - Yeah, I guess. You know what, I knew he was queer. The way he's been drooling over you all morning. - He was not. - Come on Corin, you like projects. Help the little fella outta the closet. - No way. - Why? - A, I'm too old to be dealing with drama like that. B, he's in a relationship. - Early day? - Mh, I have to make my bitch some dinner. - Mh, do you think he'll actually show up for it? - [Corin] He better. (soft music) - How's the coffee mom? - Just fine dear. - So the dresses at Myron's Bridal go on sale Saturday only. - So, when shall I pick you up? - Well they're open at nine. - I'll be outside at 8:45. So, how was your first day? - A little scary, but I'll pick up on everything alright. My boss seems a little rushed with paperwork. But uh, he's very friendly. His name's Corin. - Corrine? - [Elliot] No, Corin. - That's an odd name for a man. - Well, I guess he's kinda gay. - Well, then I guess his name fits him. Why do parents do that? They should know better than to name their kids something like that. They're just asking for it. - Well he's very friendly, he's a very nice person, he was telling jokes all day at work. - [Marti] I've met lots of gays, they're really funny. And they dress really good, too. - [Elliot] Well Corin says that-- - I don't think it's right to mingle with that type. God made men and women for a reason. And all they do is destroy other people's lives. Well they base everything they do on lies, and a disrespect for God. - I don't really think they're that bad. I mean we know they're gonna go to hell eventually, but they're not really hurting anybody while they're here. - Well I guess you don't want to go to Corin's for dinner then. He invited us over this week, and I told him all about you, he seems really excited to meet you. - Sure. I guess we could. (suspenseful music) (TV playing faintly) - Guess I'm a little late. Went out with Benji tonight, and we got a bite to eat, so sorry I'm a little late. - So you stayed for dessert? - What's that supposed to mean? - What if you want to read into it Jake? - What are accusing me of? - Quit giving me reasons to think bad shit about you. Pick up a fucking telephone once in a while. Think about somebody other than yourself. Spoiled little. - Will you just stop putting such a stranglehold on me, please? - The only thing holding you here is my bank account. So the faster that we can get these guys docking the sooner it'll come. And that's what is so very important about these deposit records getting out on time. - Oh, no problem. Hey there's this really great pub that Marti and I go to called McCullubs. - Oh, I used to go there in college. - Really? Well you and your boyfriend should go out with us tomorrow night. - Oh, I don't know Elliot, I'm not really into the bar scene. - No, no, it's really cool. I mean everybody there is really great. And if there's any problems, I promise we'll leave right away. - Oh, alright, one condition though. Take you out to Club 94 this weekend. - What's Club 94? - It's where all the gay boys hangout. - Oh, I've never been to a gay bar before. They don't come out and have sex right there, do they? - No, it's not a bath house. Just a regular bar. - Well I think Marti might be a little uncomfortable. - Oh no, no, no there'll be girls there too. - Really, but why? - Oh you know, fruit flys, street boys like lesbians, don't ya? - Yeah, I guess we're supposed to. (chuckling) (laughing) - You're okay Elliot. - What's a bath house? - I wonder what their house is gonna look like? - I don't know, I've never been to a gay person's house before. - I bet you there gonna have flowers, and bright pink pillows, and Madonna posters. There's not gonna be condoms all over the floor, is there? - Oh, I don't know. I hope not. - Well I'm glad they're using them rather than being unsafe. - Can we change the subject? - What is wrong with you? - Nothing, it's just this is my boss we're talking about. I'd rather not discuss if he leaves his used condoms laying around the floor. - I wonder if they're gonna have a dungeon. - Come on in, have a seat. You were expecting disco balls, weren't ya? - Hey, have you seen my white belt? - Yeah I think it's in the bathroom. Jake, this is Elliot, his fiance Marti. - Oh, hi. - [Marti] You've got a gorgeous home. - Oh thanks hun, Corin keeps it up. I'll be ready in a second. (pop music) - The eventer breed are hell. - I need a drink. - So when she leans over I see her boobs. (laughing) - Hey, sex on the beach. Could you make that a bourbon, neat? How's it hanging fellas? - Oh, look at his ass. - Is there something you want to drink? - Garmin, diet. - [Woman In Hat] Are you old enough to be in here? - Wanna see my ID? - Oh no, but there's something else I definitely want to check out. You're a really good dresser. - Thanks, it's an inherited trait. - [Man In Gray] What about that? - Man, that's an old pussy. Probably all shriveled up like your mom's. Hey what do you think buddy? Would you eat pussy as old as your mom's? - You know, you can't have pussy until you had the pussy that had you. - Oh girl, he's a cutie too. - I heard that. - God I ought to put some Madonna on the music. - [Both Women] Oh! (rock music) - [Patrons] Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! (cheering) - You are so lucky to have gay guys. Where did you get them? - It's been tough, I've known I was different since I was seven. - You poor thing, must have been so hard on you. Haven't you ever been curious about what it would be like to make love to a woman? - Well yeah, I've wondered about it. I just don't know if I can pull it off. - One night with me and I bet I can change your life. (laughing and chatter) (cheering) - Alright, deal's a deal. (dance music) - This is so insane, I can't believe it. - I can't believe how many gorgeous men are in this room, and I don't stand a chance with any of 'em. - I know, doesn't it suck? What a waste. - Excuse me. Hi, I'm Maggie. - I'm Tom. - Did that do anything for you? - No. - Thanks honey. Oh, hot guy over there. (moaning) - I'd like to suck the children right out of that one. - Need another drink? - Where's the restroom? - It's down the backside of the bar. - Do you think one of you could come with me? - Oh don't worry honey, they may be lesbians, but they only bite if you ask them to. Come on, I'll fend off the fish. - [Chantal] Hi. - [Elliot] Oh, hi. - You don't recognize me, do you? Well we met the other day. Well actually we didn't meet, we just saw each other at the bookstore. - Oh my gosh. - Well that's what most guys say when it finally clicks. Anyway, I'm Chantal. - Chantal? - Well, Sean by day, Chantal by night. And you are? - [Elliot] Uh, I'm Elliot. - Sweet delicious little Elliot. So, are you hear by yourself? - No, I'm here with my girlfriend. - Oh honey, no, no, no. Not that little beard? - Beard? - Yeah, the girl you were with at the bookstore the other day? The one you're here with tonight? Darling, you're gay. - No, (stammering) I'm not. - Oh just give me five minutes in the woods to prove it. - Well if it isn't the not so much a lady who's a tramp. - Fuck off bitch. Didn't you go down in 1912? - You know I haven't gone down half as many times as you have. (gasping) Oh by the way the vet called, they put your fairy dragmother down. Come on El. - Girl, you've got more on your hands than you know what to deal with. - No, no, I can't dance. - Come on. ♫ You came into my life ♫ One look in your eyes ♫ Took me by surprise ♫ It's youuu ♫ And nobody else ♫ Your love has made me There you go. ♫ So blind I can't see ♫ I am his champion ♫ In heaven above ♫ So catch me I'm falling baby ♫ Hold on to my love ♫ Catch me I'm falling ♫ Catch me now I'm falling ♫ Catch me I'm falling ♫ Catch me (dramatic music) - Elliot I've got your clean underwear. (clicking rapidly) I hope you're not looking at one of those websites with naked girls. - I wasn't. I was just checking my email. When one of those junk folders opened and it had all these ads that just keep popping up, and I couldn't get it to stop. It was really pissing me off. - Elliot, come on, no swearing in this house. And no more popups. (camera clicking) - [Elliot] Surprise. - Jesus Elliot. - I'm sorry. - It's just way too early for that. - I just needed to use up a couple of these last pictures. Hey Corin I was wondering if you and I could go to lunch later on today. There's a couple things I wanted to talk to you about. You know. - Sure. - Okay. I just don't know if I'm ready to get married right now. I mean, I love Marti, but I've just realized I have all these unanswered questions in my life. And I don't think it's really fair to drag her into that right now. - Well it's good you're taking Marti's feelings into consideration. Don't do something just for your mother, to make her happy. - Well I don't want to get married just because my mother wants me to. I just wish I knew where my father was right now. Then I could talk to him about all of this. - Would he understand better? - Well I'd like to think he's a little more understanding about these sort of things than my mother would be. - You haven't seen him in a while. - No. I think he sent me a birthday card once. My mother tore it up and threw it away. When I tell her I'm putting this wedding on hold, I mean she's gonna go insane. - Tell you what, why don't you stop by? Watch a movie with me and Jake, hang out with the guys. - The guys? You know what I mean. - So why does she make her daughter call her mommy dearest? - Hello, she is psycho. Well probably just a bit poor actually. Hi, popcorn, popcorn. - Elliot, can I get you anything? - [Elliot] No. - [Jake] So you and Corin been getting along pretty well, huh? - Oh yeah. He's terrific to work for. So you guys have been together for five years? - [Jake] Yeah, crazy. It's like 25 in gay years. - So how did you know that he was the one? - [Jake] Well, I don't know if he's the one. I mean, I love him, but things tend to fizzle every now and then if you know what I mean. - Oh. So, how do you make things better? - Well, don't tell him I told you this. - No, I swear. - Whenever trying to get him to talk to me after a fight, or you know I'm ever trying to get him to, well you know, I tickle him. - You tickle him? - Yeah, yeah, he like gets totally aroused by it, and he can't control his erection. - Yes? (stammering) Bitch. (laughing) Bitch. (laughing) You bitches. You know what that does to me. (laughing) (soft music) (birds chirping) (sighing) Okay, so just fill in each of these, answer in most cases is going to be no. But if you're ever unsure about anything don't be afraid to ask about it. Um, package each one with a label. Which Johnny should already have printed for you. And make sure you get them into the post office by four o'clock, so they can go in today's mail. Questions? - Corin I, can I see you in my office for a minute? - [Corin] Yeah, sure. (eerie music) - I feel really odd about asking you this, but I'm doing it because I love you. Is there something going on between you and Elliot? - Oh God, no. - I know my morals aren't the highest, but people around here are saying differently. - [Corin] Well I don't give a flying fuck what anybody in this office says about it. - [Nancy] I know Corin, you don't have to explain. - I think I do have to explain. You know I love Jake, I'd never do anything to hurt him. - I do know that Corin, but I have to admit you and Elliot have been spending a lot of time together. And he's becoming increasingly affectionate towards you. - Look, people can talk all they want in this office. I'm trying to help Elliot out, I know how he feels, I've been there. - Corin. - Everybody in this office can just piss off. (phone ringing) - Hello. - Hey it's me. - Hey, what time you coming over? - Oh god Marti, I'm sorry, I completely forgot I already made plans with Corin. - Elliot we talked about this last week. - I know, my god I'm sorry. I already said I'd pick him up in 20 minutes, you should have called and reminded me. - I'm not your mother Elliot. I used to think that I was your girlfriend, but I haven't seen you in four nights. And so I'm starting to wonder about that too. (phone clicking) (sighing) (knocking) - [Corin] Hey come on in, sorry I'm running a little bit late. Sorry I had to drop off the artwork over at the printer. Got in to a much lengthier discussion than I planned to. Those guys are real idiots sometimes. - Where's Jake? - [Corin] He's upstairs with Maggie, she's gonna meet us down at the theater after dinner. It's too bad Marti couldn't come with. - Oh yeah, she had to stay home, she had a lot of work to get done tonight. - [Corin] Oh, it's good she's dedicated to reaching her goals. (eerie music) - [Mrs. Hamilton] Oh Marti, oh I'm sorry dear, Elliot's not home. - Oh, I know Ms. Hamilton. He's out to dinner with Corin. I just came to get a few of those bridal magazines I left the other night. - Um, Corin? Isn't he that gay gentleman? - Oh, yeah. We went out for drinks a couple of nights ago. And now they're like best friends. (gasping) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Probably my hoe Maggie. Hello? - Did you catch the remote over there? - [Jake] Hey what's up? - No, mh mh. (snickering) - Don't even think about it. (snickering) Oh shit. (laughing) Alright, alright. - [Elliot] I think I'm gonna go to the washroom. - Who called? (dramatic music) So now Jake thinks that Elliot is in love with me, even though he's still in the closet. - I hate to break it to you honey, but I think he's got a crush on you too. - So what am I supposed to do, tell him to stop? Fire him? I can't do that. - Do you have feelings for him? - No, you know I love Jake. Elliot's not even my type. - Oh that's right, he's already out of high school. - You're not even remotely amusing. - Sorry. - You know I'm just tryna be there for him. I never had anybody when I was growing up, trying to come out. - Yeah but to damage your own relationship, is it worth it? - You know Jake was only 17 when I met him. - [Nancy] Uh, hello, illegal. - Well, we waited 'til 12:01 on his 18th birthday. I think after the first three years we spent together we finally got out and saw what else was there. - Hm, you know you were there for Jake for his coming out process, maybe he came to think of you more as a parent than as a boyfriend. Now that his wings are strong he wants to go out and see the world. Maybe if you guys put things on hold for a while, until you figure out what you each want. - I know what I want, it's Jake who's undecided. - And if you bring up the idea of a separation it might freak him out, and get his butt in gear. (soft music) - I'm losing him. - Then fight for him. - I can't compete with a bunch of skinny 20 year olds. - You act like you're decades older than you are. Forget what those bitter fags have to say, you are gorgeous, and you're one of the most wonderful people I've ever met. He loves you, Corin. He'll come around to what's important. - Am I still gonna be around then? - [Maggie] Alright, spit it out. - [Jake] What? - Your issues? - What are you talking about Maggie? - You and Corin are becoming distant, and it's mostly because you're pushing him away. You're even wondering if maybe you shouldn't just let Elliot have Corin, since he obviously wants him. And you can't seem to make a decision for yourself. There, now are we doing playing that guess what's wrong with me game? - Damn, you're good. - I know, that's why I'm your fruit fly. (sighing) - [Jake] So what's your analysis? - My analysis? Is that you're a major dumb ass. You better figure out whether or not you love him, and start appreciating what you've got with him. Because it could all be gone in a second. You know, I had my suspicions, but now I definitely know. Gay men are just as bad as women. - So he was telling me all these crazy stories about the stuff they used to do in college like skinny dipping, and drinking until he puked, and oh. - Ow. Do you have anything else to talk about? - What's wrong with you? - I don't know Elliot. Maybe just once in a while I'd like to have a conversation that didn't involve something that Corin said, or something Corin did. - And what would you rather talk about? - I don't know Elliot, how 'bout the wedding? - Fine, if you don't want me to talk about the only male friend I probably ever. So, I guess you don't wanna go to their party on Saturday. - (sighing) Are there gonna be any straight people there? - A few, I think. (buzzing) (classical music playing) (chatting) I think I'm gonna go see if Corin needs some help. (snickering) - [Corin] Will you give me a hand with this? (glasses clinking) - [Both] Cheers. - So Marti, how long have you known Elliot? - [Elliot] How'd you know I had to dig deep? - [Corin] I mean you had no idea. (coughing) (sighing) (TV playing) - Marti why are you, what's going on? - Well. What do you think? - It's um, it's different. Are you okay? Where's my mom? - She isn't home from work yet, which means that we have time to. - Oh Marti, I don't know what to say. - [Marti] You don't have to say anything, just do something. - Oh god Marti, I just can't. Not right now. - Why not Elliot? - I've got a lot on my mind right now. Corin has a big workload that I have to sort through. - Oh, fuck Corin and his big load! What is wrong with you? Is there something wrong with me? You haven't touched me for weeks. All you want to do is this with Corin, and that with Corin. I'm the one that you're marrying Elliot, not him. - Well I just want to keep him happy Marti, he is my boss. - Yes Elliot, he's your boss, not your lover. You are becoming completely obsessed with him. - Fuck you Marti. You're just pissed off because I'm spending a few minutes of my fucking time with somebody other than you. - Oh excuse me for not only being your fiance, but the only friend you've had since grade school. - [Elliot] I don't need to listen to any of this. - Elliot! (somber music) - [Mrs. Hamilton] Well they base everything they do on lies, and a disrespect for God. - [Corin] What is this? You cooked? - Baby steps. (kissing) - So what brought this on? - Nothing. I just have a lot of apologies for the last few months of insanity. And I've been really confused about what I want out of life, and what I want to happen with us. I know it's been tearing you up inside, but I just want you to know that it means the world to me that you stuck around for all this time. - Thanks. I don't know what to say. - I just I, - What, it's okay. - I'm so confused right now. And, - Look, why don't we, let's get out of here. Let's you and me go away for the weekend. (somber music) - I hope it's not a problem, and if it is I can come back some other time. - No, no, it's fine. Just tell me what's wrong with Marti. - It's not Marti, it's me. She's all gung-ho about this wedding and I'm not. - Shit. - What? (sighing) - Nothing, just missing some laundry. Jake's problem wearing it. So when did you feel that you weren't? - Um, I don't think things are right with us right now. I mean, I don't think I love Marti the way that a man should love his wife. - [Corin] Are you in love with somebody else? - I don't really know what's going on with me right now, but I'm starting to think that all I have with Marti is a really deep friendship. I mean, how am I supposed to tell her that? My mother's going to completely freak out. - Hey, what did I tell you before? You gotta take care of yourself before you can take care of anybody else. And if you really are this unsure of it, somebody could really wind up being hurt in the end. (phone ringing) Sorry, it was my bitch. - Oh, where's she? - She's picking up some supplies at the store. - Supplies? - Yeah, we're going out to our trailer this weekend. - Could I come with you guys? - Oh gee Elliot. - Please Corin, I promise, I'll just sleep in the trailer, and I'll spend the rest of the weekend by myself. You won't even know I'm there. Where's Corin? - He's at his alone place. - His what? - It's this place he goes out in the woods, it's just north of the lake, he goes out there to be one with nature. It's the Jon Dembrow thing in him. He goes out there for hours by himself. - Oh. Well, I think I'm gonna take a walk. What time should I be back for dinner? - I don't know, seven. (crickets chirping) - Hey. - [Elliot] Hi. Mind if I join you? - Yeah, come on up. - [Elliot] It's quiet. - Beautiful. Nothing you can see or hear that's man made. All the problems I have, at work or at home, doesn't matter up here. - I shouldn't be here. - No, no, stay it's alright. - But this is your private place, I shouldn't have come. I shouldn't have intruded. - No, it's nice to have someone who can appreciate it. Jake just doesn't understand it. - [Elliot] What are you thinking about? - Jake, the problems we've been having, how to make it work in the long run. - I'm gay Corin. - I know. - You do, why didn't you say anything? - You had to figure it out yourself. I was just in the sidelines, waiting to be there for ya, when you finally figured it out. (sighing) - You don't know how much of a weight has been, it's been just lifted off of my shoulders right now. - Yeah, actually I do Elliot. Anyone who's ever come out of the closet knows what it's like. You finally tell that first person. I'm glad you trusted me enough to let me be that person. Feels like you can breath again, doesn't it? - Yeah. Getting kinda cloudy tonight. I was hoping for an October moon. - October moon, what's that? - Oh, it's a moon you only see a few times a year, mostly in October. It's this burnt orange color, and it's so big and full, it hangs so low to the ground that it seems like you could almost reach out and touch it. It's beautiful. Perfect. Untouchable. It makes me happy just to look at it, and I'm happy even though I know that it'll never be mine. Just being around it, well it's wonderful. So would you ever consider dating anyone else? - No. I love Jake. I knew I loved him from the moment I saw him. 17 year old busboy. He might be a pain in my ass, but I really do believe we'll still be together when I die. (upbeat music) - [Jake] Hey will you go wake up Corin and tell him dinner's almost ready? - Sure. (suspenseful music) Corin. Um, dinner's ready. (sighing) - That was the most uncomfortable covers in my life. - I don't ever wanna see that fucking bitch in this house again. You know, why'd you even bring him in the first place? - I told you he guilted me into it. I didn't invite him, he invited himself. - Then grow a set of fucking balls Corin. It's supposed to be our weekend, just the two of us, instead we've got some closet case in tow. - Look if you would have spoken up in the first place and said something, none of this would have ever happened. Instead, you were just a whiny little cunt the whole time. (scoffing) - Screw you. You knew damn well I didn't want him there. And you can't deny that he doesn't want your cock in his mouth, because he pretty much proved that tonight. - Alright, fine. But I see him everyday at work, what am I supposed to do? What would make you happy? - If I ever see you with him again I'm gone and I'm not coming back. - Well they were supposed to be docking on Tuesday, and I. Yeah, I know, I know. (dramatic music) Okay, alright. Great doing business with you too. Alright, bye bye. Hi Elliot. - I tried calling you a couple times yesterday to talk about what happened. You never returned my calls. - I was doing some repair work with Jake. - Oh. Where do you want to go for lunch? - Uh, I actually have to have lunch with Nancy. Get this doc business straightened up. - Oh. - [Nancy] I don't know what to say, it's like a gay version of Glenn Close. - Oh stop it, it's not that dramatic. - Look don't get mad at me for suggesting this, but is it possible you let his crush on you grow because it made you feel good? - No, not at all. - I'm serious Corin. You know Jake's pushing you away, in comes the little straight boy, he falls for you, suddenly you've got sexual power of somebody. That's quite the ego boost. - That's quite the load of crap. You can burn all your Dr. Phil books. - Do I need to move him to another department? - In where, maintenance? There's no other place for him. And besides people would talk. - Like they're not already. (knocking) - Hey guys. I saw you outside through the window, and didn't look like you were doing too much business talk anymore. Mind if I intrude? (suspenseful music) - What the fuck? - What? - [Automated Voice] You have 23 new messages. (phone beeping) - No way. - [Elliot] Hi um, Corin, this is Elliot. I was just giving you a call to see you at work. (phone beeping) Hey Corin it's Elliot, uh I guess you're kind of busy. (phone beeping) Again Corin it's El, just giving you a call. Alright, talk to you later. (phone beeping) It's Elliot, hey um, anytime you'd like to call back would be really convenient. (phone ringing) (thrilling music) - What are you doing Elliot? There are 23 messages on my answering machine. - What, I didn't think I called that many times. - Well you did. What's going through your head? - I just needed to talk to you. - About what? Do you understand nothing is going to happen between us? I am with Jake, I am staying with Jake, nothing is going to change that. - I'm sorry Corin. I didn't mean to make you mad. - Look, I know you didn't, but it's clear we can't be around each other. Maybe you should start looking for another job. - I'm sorry Corin. It won't happen again. - Well you're goddamn right it won't. (crinkling) So are we ever gonna be back to normal? - [Jake] I don't know. (eerie music) (camera clicking) - I came in early this morning to proof the new out of the pan menus, I left them on your desk. If everything's okay I can take 'em to the printers for you during my lunch break. I was gonna. - I'll have Johnny drop 'em off. (eerie music) (breathing hard) - Hey Corin? - [Johnny] He left about 20 minutes ago. - Oh crap Johnny, don't do that. - Sorry. - Why didn't he tell me he was leaving? - You were in a meeting and he said he would call you later tonight. - Did he give you the print for the textile ad? - No I think Elliot was proofing it just before he left, it's probably on the desk. - Okay thanks. - See ya. (suspenseful music) (thudding) Guess I have a habit of that today. - Jesus Johnny, I get to experience that twice. - Yeah, unlike the men I meet in bars. Just forgot my gay planner, tootles. (suspenseful music) - Oh shit. - I can explain. - You don't have to say anything. Unfortunately I'm not the only one who knows about this. It has been a topic of water cooler gossip for the past several weeks. You're giving yourself, Corin, and this company a very negative image. - But Nancy I, - On top of that your personal appearance has declined. I do not consider this appropriate office attire. - Well if it's about my shirt, it's right out at my desk, I could. - I'm giving you a chance to leave on your own terms, an amicable separation, it'll look better on your resume. And if a future employer calls I would be more than happy to give you a good reference. But this has to happen peacefully and before Corin arrives. - [Corin] Good morning Jim. - Good morning Corin. - [Corin] Oh look, you blew up a picture of yourself. - Whatever. - Hey. - Hey gorgeous. - We need to talk. (suspenseful music) - Why the hell isn't he at work? (phone ringing) I saw you! Damn it. (eerie music) - Marti. - What is this Elliot? - I, I. - Answer me damn it. - Give those to me. What are you doing here? - Why Elliot, why are you doing this to me? - [Elliot] It's not my fault, Corin did this to me. - What? - None of this ever happened until I met him. I think about him all the time. All I do is think about him all day. I can't stop. I'm going insane, I can't control the way I think about him all the time. - [Marti] Elliot did you have sex with him? - No, I didn't. - Then how do you know? - Because I love him. - Don't! (thrilling music) - Get out of my house. - Mom. - Out! - But mom. - No son of mine is going to be like that. (sobbing) - I can't help it. - How could you do this to me? What's the family going to think? Your grandparents? Don't you dare mention this to your grandparents. - But mom. (slapping) - You are either going to marry Marti and forget this entire thing, or you are no longer my son. - Corin did this to me, I swear. I can't control what I'm feeling. - [Mrs. Hamilton] You are just like your father. Get out of my house. (lightening cracking) (knocking) - Elliot, you know you can't be here. - My mother threw me out, I don't have anywhere else to go. - Look I just, I can't trust you. - They found out. - [Corin] Who did? - My mom and Marti, they found my pictures of you. I only took them because, because I love you. I don't have anyone else right now. - [Jake] Hey Corin where are you? - Look, you've betrayed all my trust in you and if Jake sees you standing here he's gonna flip out. You've gotta go. - No Corin, don't. Please wait. - I'm sorry, goodbye. - Please, wait. (lightening cracking) (sniffling) You can't leave me Corin. (breathing hard) You can't leave me. - You don't keep making these sequels unless there's an audience. - What's wrong with you? - What do you mean? - You just changed your clothes, dear cakes. - You need to do some laundry one of these days. - Never. (knocking) - [Corin] I got it. (slapping) - That's what you get for destroying our lives. - Marti. - You couldn't leave him alone, could you Corin? Why did you have to destroy him Corin? He was mine. He was mine! (sighing) - [Jake] You didn't destroy anybody's lives. Elliot brought this on himself by not being honest. - It's still gonna affect other people, it doesn't matter how old he is. - Yeah but you know, come to terms with who you are before you have a wedding planned, or kids in the works. The guy's 30 for Christ sakes. - I should have let him in Jake, he doesn't have anywhere to go. I'm the only person that he trusts. - And he shouldn't have gone all psycho obsessive over you then. Damn it, do you want to go look for him, or what? - Yeah I do, but, I don't know where to start. Where would he go? (sobbing) (lightening cracking) (dramatic music) (people chatting) (raining) (knocking) (knocking) (laughing) Oh come on kids. (thrilling music) (thudding) Jake? Are you back? (screaming) (laughing) - Sorry, I forgot my wallet. - (laughing) Nice. - I only got eight bucks, can I borrow some money? - Didn't I give you 20 this morning? - I went to breakfast with Maggie. - While I was looking for Elliot. Make sure you're back in time for Dohan Jones' party tonight. - I hope you don't think I'm gonna be wearing a costume tonight, 'cause uh hell no. - Oh I wouldn't dream of it. (hangers shuffling) (screaming) (car beeping) (thrilling music) (thudding) (muffled groaning) (footsteps) - Corin! Corin! (thrilling music) Corin! (birds shrieking) Corin! Fucking bitch. It could have been so easy. All I wanted to do was get you to be alone with me, just the two of us. But I never wanted to hurt you. I just wanted to take you to a place where we could talk. But I just can't trust you now, can I? I know this is gonna hurt. I didn't think I was gonna have to resort to such an extreme measure. But I am going to get you to listen to me. And know that I can treat you better than Jake or anyone else. You owe that to me. (groaning) I know it hurts Corin, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just had to make sure that you couldn't get away again. - You can't be serious. You're not actually gonna wear that to that party, are you? - Hey. This thing is gonna get me laid tonight, don't you think? - Um, I don't think there's gonna be any other breeders at this party. (sighing) Come on. - [Maggie] Just put on something, like one of Corin's outfits. (thrilling music) - [Jake] Corin! Corin! (gasping) - So this is a roommate? - No, he's my boyfriend. - Oh, I see. So did the two of you have some sort of disagreement earlier today, a little tiff? - Tiff? The fuck are you talking about? - [Maggie] Jake, calm down. - No, no, no, what are you implying? - I'm saying we've dealt with couples like you before, trying to get revenge on each other by creating some sort of dramatic situation. - The only thing dramatic about this situation is that I'm gonna go down to your office and I'm gonna file a sexual discrimination suit. How's that? - Right. My apologies if you misinterpreted what I was saying. - Can't fucking believe this bullshit. I know he has him, I know. (dramatic music) - Elliot please. - Shhh. (breathing hard) I've always wanted to do that, since the day I met you. I love you. - What are you doing here? - I want my boyfriend back. - I already told the cops I don't know where Elliot is. Besides, what difference does it make, he didn't kidnap Corin. - How do you know? You kicked him out of your life last night, right? - Get out of here, or I'm gonna call the cops. - What are you gonna tell 'em? A faggot tried to break into your apartment? - Yeah, that's right. A faggot. - Look, I'm sorry that Elliot lied to you. But that's not my fault, and it's not Corin's. In all honesty I don't give a shit what Elliot does with his life, or with you. All I care about is getting my boyfriend back. Now I know, I know, that you have some kind of suspicion . You know, Corin hasn't been anything but nice to you. He has so much respect for you. He wanted to warn you about Elliot, before Elliot could even figure it out about himself. Can you just, he didn't want to see you get hurt. That's a real fucking shame that you won't consider doing the same thing for him. If my boyfriend winds up dead, I'm blaming you. (car starting) (screaming) You knew where they were the whole fucking time! Didn't you? (screaming) (thrilling music) - Jake. - Corin. - Oh Jake. (slicing) (screaming) - What are you doing here? This, this, this is my house! Nobody told you to come here! - I came for my boyfriend! - He's with me now. (laughing) Do you even realize that he's the most wonderful human being that God put on the face of this earth? - [Jake] Yes, yes! - Liar! You are too consumed with yourself. If you only knew what I had to go through to get him here alone. And I know that if people would just leave us alone, I know that if you would talk me. But what I did, what I did, what I did. What I did, what I did, I did. I did, I did out of love. Because I love you. And you, you're just gonna have to stay out of our way! - You're fucking insane! (sobbing) - Oh, am I? Go on. Tell him, tell him you can love me. Tell him. - I want you to listen very carefully to me Elliot. I love Jake. He's the only person that I'll love for the rest of my life. (thrilling music) - [Jake] No! No! (yelling) - It's okay. It's okay, it's alright. It's okay. - No! No! (sobbing) No, no! (sobbing) Please, please, please. (dramatic music) (groaning) (footsteps running) - [Marti] I need to know that you're. - [Elliot] Corin made me feel this way I swear. I don't know how to control what I'm feeling. - You are just like your father. (screaming) (coughing) - Please tell me, please tell me. - Oh God, oh God. Oh Corin, what did I do? Oh God, what did I do? I'm so sorry, so sorry. (yelling) (groaning) - You fucking took him away from me, the only person I loved. And now he's never gonna come back. (gagging) (screaming) (yelling) (groaning) (screaming) - You killed him! Why, why did you kill him?! - That fucker took my life away. I love Corin. I never got to tell him that before he died. (groaning) (soft music) Yeah yeah, I'd like to report a double murder. - The gay lovers were discovered in an abandoned farm house, where coincidentally a family had been found slaughtered 17 years earlier. - Says her son was the victim, having been seduced by Corin Buckman. - The gay killings were the result of a homosexual affair. - The trap for the gay slashing begins today, as Marti White stands before a jury to decide. - Were the result of. - The gay couple. - Gay men who killed for love. ♫ Watch the rain sets ♫ Stating everything ♫ Finds my face and it ♫ Bombs away - [Elliot] Getting kinda cloudy tonight.
