I have to change it because I have to paint... On the beast's stage, we removed the blood, amputated arms and legs. The corpses on the bottom are more decomposed than the ones on the top, kind of all piled up, providing some variety to the main colour. Great. You can detach some of the corpses' heads and launch them at the beast as a weapon. Fantastic. We did all the internal organs. And the corpses' mechanism is designed to move and burst when the beast steps on them. And before heading to Hokkaido, which is up north, we stayed a night at a ryokan, in the mountains. A hotel with thermal baths. -Yes. It was amazing. It was full of parents and children, all bathing butt naked. But it was all quite natural, you know? Well... I've never in my life seen my dad naked. Help! Help! Get me out of here! Somebody get me out of here! Please! Help! Help! Help! I can't get out! Help! I can't open! Please, help! Hello? -Are you OK? Are you alone? Yes, I'm alone! Please, help! Can't you open the door? I can't! Try again. I've tried many times! Please, help! OK, relax! I'll try to open it. Listen, relax. You have to move away from the door. I'll try to knock it down. Stay back. OK? Stay back. Understood? Answer. -Yes or no? -Yes. -I'll knock it down, OK? Stay back. Come. Are you OK? Stay there. -You stayed at home? -Yes. Do you often stay home alone? -One more. -No. Were you playing here? What were you playing? -The piano. -The piano? OK. You seem fine. Nonetheless, if you feel any chest or breathing discomfort, go straight to the hospital, OK? -Thanks. All done. We're leaving. See you later, champ. -See you. I´ll be right back. Fortunately, the neighbor was home and he came in and... Wait here for a moment, please. When we arrived, we simply attended to the boy, we opened, well the windows were already open. When you entered there was not much smoke? Wasn't the atmosphere very condensed? The normal, nothing out of the ordinary. What's your name? Cristian. I'm Julián. You play the piano incredibly well. Thanks. Do you want to be a pianist? No? What do you want to be? A gardener. A gardener? Yes. Why is that? I really like plants. Do you have plants here? No, they're at my grandma's house. You cared for them there? Yes. How did you take care of them? I watered them, took bugs off, and played them the piano. You played your plants the piano? Of course, plants can feel music. And they can feel whether you're happy or sad. How so? They have a sensor in their petals that makes them hear everything. What did you want to be when you were a kid? Me? I wanted to be many things. But there was a time I wanted to be a tiger. A tiger? Yes. You can't be a tiger. -You can't be a tiger? -No. I thought I could be one when I was a kid. Do you know tigers are afraid of faces? -Faces? -Yes. And hunters place a mask back here so that they don't get attacked from behind while they're hunting. Where did you hear that? I saw it in a documentary. -You like documentaries? -Yes. Yeah? Cristian, my child. What happened? Curtains got burned and I couldn't get out. Thank you so much. Thank you. The important thing is that Cristian is OK. My mother left this abandoned for around 15 years. I told her to rent it, but she was really scared and stubborn. And so these things happen, right? Houses deteriorate due to lack of use. It's in a bad state. But I never thought this would happen. Oh, well. You know where to find us if you need anything. Sure, likewise. Excuse me. Can you turn the music down? -Good evening. -I inhaled smoke before... Are you OK? Your EKG is fine, nothing unusual shows up in the tests. It seems that anxiety caused you to faint. A panic attack, basically. Has this happened before? No. It's unpleasant, but it's completely harmless. Fainting isn't very common, but it's not uncommon either. It's the way the brain defends itself when it undergoes a stress or intense-fear episode. Are you going through a stressful time? Work, family issues? No. I'll put you on anti-anxiety medication. It will help you sleep and control your anxiety. Take one a day for a month. And if you have more anxiety than usual, take two, not more. And if you feel it is appropriate, find someone to talk to. Perhaps a psychologist, or a friend or a partner. Talking is important. Stick it in. Sorry, it's just that... Relax. I can't. Lie down. Sorry, do you mind if we stop for a second? Sure, don't worry. Are you OK? Yes. I'm sorry. Don't say sorry, it's not a big deal. It's fine. Right... So, what is it? Do you want to sleep over? What's the time? Well, I have to work in three hours, and I have to stop at my place first, so... Of course. OK. OK. I like the first option the most. With its skull exposed. That will set the base and we'll move on from there. -Yes. -I'd make it more lion-shaped, more majestic, you know? With a longer tail, reptile-like, with spikes on the end of its tail. OK. We have to think about the beast's personality because it's a final stage boss, and it has to leave an impression. I'll start working on this and send you this ASAP, OK? -OK. -All good? -All good. -Let's move on to the villagers. Ok, cool. For the NPCs of the village, we have created a base of twenty models. This is the child model. By playing with the face, clothes and skin color, we could create several different characters. This is the girls. That we would do exactly the same. And this would be the adult male. And the woman's... Why are you such a bore, love? -Listen to me. -Nobody's there. Let's go to the next bar and get a free drink. -Happy birthday! -Happy birthday! I don't play games. I can't watch people play. I mean, I'm like a narco. I sell a product, but don't consume it. It's true, I'm an artist. I feed off of what I see, of you guys... My goal is for gamers not to be 15-year-old kids. It's easy to draw kids in. -Right. Drawing in someone who is 60, a mother... -Sandra, I'm leaving. -No, no, no. -Yes. -Are you really leaving? Happy birthday. I got to go. -Are you OK? -I'm tired. I've been working nights for several days in a row and... OK. Diana, I can't believe it, you're here! I worked it all out. All good. Thanks. -I got you something. -There was no need. -It's your birthday. -All right then. -Open it. -Thanks. -One of my favourite films. -Thanks, I've not seen it. -No? -No. It's on at the Filmoteca tomorrow. Want to watch it on a big screen? -I'm not sure if I'll be OK tomorrow. -Right. So, how are you? -Great, but Julián's leaving. Sorry, Julián this is Diana, Diana this is Julián. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Tell him not to leave. Don't leave. -You know the game, right? -No. Yeah, damn it, you were a rhombus and you had to cut out an image that was hiding a naked girl. -You don't know that one? -No. It can't be that you make video games and you don't know that game. I swear I don't know what game you're on about. It wasn't a video game, it was an arcade game. Right. We spent hours trying to see the girl naked. But when you were eight, you could find naked girls on the internet, right? It's not the same. The excitement of gradually discovering it is quite different. Right. Sandra told me you're a creature modeller. Yes. What's that? It means I model creatures on a PC. Creatures? Monsters, beasts, weird creatures. All those horrible things you can imagine. You don't model people? Naked girls, for example. I find people... I find modelling people the hardest thing in the world. Because no one knows what a monster, an alien or a demon looks like, but we see people constantly, so it's hard to hide mistakes. You have to be very talented to model people and I don't think I'm that talented. What do you do? I'm studying Art History, distance learning. I'm reading many books I had on my list, many films, TV series, but above all, I live. Fancy dancing? No, I'd rather watch you all. It's more interesting. OK. -Thanks for coming, mate. -Don't worry about it. -Love you. -Me too. Ciao. Thanks, guys! Ciao. -Bye. -Ciao. -Hello. -Hey. What are you up to? I thought I saw a friend inside. -Was he inside? -No, I don't think so. I'm meeting a friend. Fancy having a drink with us? Yeah, sure. Social networks are social, at least, but video games... Well, you can play online, with others. To kill them or to be killed... Not all video games are violent. Are yours? The ones I make are in fact quite violent, but not all video games are like that. Right. I don't quite understand it. Don't get me started on video games inciting violence. That's another topic. I mean, the very act of playing. What's so fun about slaughtering someone in a game? Raping, killing, I don't know. What's the point? I don't know. Nonetheless, games that may have violent parts or scenes aren't just about slaughtering or killing, there's always a story behind it. Right. I almost prefer gratuitous violence over those who try to justify it with a story. They seem more upfront. If you think about it, it's like watching a horror film. I'm not a big fan of horror films, you know that. But I understand that in a horror film, the relationship with violence is different, even if you enjoy it. Why? Because of the perspective. It's not the same to witness violence as being its perpetrator. -What's your issue with video games? -Why are you in favour? You have infinite lives in a video game. I believe that's what Buddhists consider hell. Living the same life over and over again. You can do whatever you want in a game. In life too. Right now, here, you can do whatever you want. You can eat, talk, walk, dance... What stops you? I guess you're right. Honestly, I don't know. -Julián! -Hello! -How are you? -Fine. Are you leaving? Yes, I had a meeting with Alana, and we're done. Great, tell me about it later. Diana came to see me. -Hi. -What's up? -She said you bumped into each other. -Yes. -Are you going to town? -Yes, that way. -Perhaps you can give him a ride. -Sure. Sorry about the other day. Huh? Elias's lecture. He can be quite a rash person when he wants to. Oh, don't worry about it. Are you two a couple? I don't know. I think I liked it better when those things were well established. People were either a couple or not. They dated, got engaged, and got married. I don't know, perhaps I'm old-fashioned. Are you dating? No. I've never actually had a girlfriend. Really? I mean, girlfriend in the sense of a stable relationship, loyalty, living together. I've not had that. Why didn't you say hi the other day at the Filmoteca's lobby? Oh, uh... -Do you mind if I answer? -Go ahead. Adela, I'm driving. What's up? Diana, your father fell when I was putting him to bed. Is he OK? Yes, he seems fine. But I can't move him by myself. OK, don't worry. I'm on my way. See you soon. Damn it, I'm sorry. I have to drop you off here. I'm taking the motorway. -Want me to come? -No. Thanks, we'll manage. I'm used to it. Well, thank you very much. I hope it's not serious. Thanks. -Bye. Ciao. -Ciao. Hey, do you fancy going to the Prado Museum tomorrow? Sure. That was my first time in the Black Paintings room. You've never been to the Prado Museum? Once, with my dad, when I was little. I remember we toured it together until we reached the Black Paintings room. He entered without me and I waited outside. It took five minutes, but it felt like forever. Then he came out and we continued the visit. And you never came back, not even for your degree? No. Did you find it scary? -More like sadness. -Why? My dad had a stroke two years ago. He was stable for the first few months, but he got worse quickly. I live with him now. Somebody gives me a hand from time to time, but I take care of him most of the time. You seem to be really close. Really close. Do you get along with your parents? Well, uh... Sorry. You don't have to tell me about your family. -I´m too inquisitive -No. My mum died when I was little. -I'm sorry. -It's all right. I barely remember her. And my dad... I don't really talk to my dad. I told my dad's carer to stay with him tonight. Fancy grabbing a drink? Sure. I like your monsters. They have a lot of inner life, yeah? Yeah? What does that mean? Well, I don't know, they have a melancholic look, as if they're worried about something. I don't know. Whenever I watch alien films, I think about that. About their day-to-day life, their worries. If women are affected by the moon's cycle, imagine what it would be like living on a planet with five moons. So, you think about those things while watching Avatar? I haven't seen Avatar, but those things catch my eye. -Excuse me, have a light? -Yes. Thanks. What shall we do? I don't know. Shall we go dancing? -I'm going to the WC... -Huh? I'm going to the WC. Want to wait for me downstairs? OK. -Is it a piece of glass? -No. -It looks like wood. -Not bad, huh? My foot is all black. That happens when you dance barefoot. It's comfier, yeah? Well, that's that. -I had a great time. -Likewise. And you're a really good dancer. You say that surprised. No, it's a statement. It's the second time we've danced. Don't lie. You didn't dance at all the first time. You just watched me. It'd be nice to see each other again, if you're up for it. I'm up for it. -Yeah? -Yeah. We could go out for dinner or catch a film. -OK. -Great. Rest up. -Yeah, you too. -Ciao. -Ciao. This way, please. Did you get here by car? You can certainly get to the centre of Madrid in 25 minutes. And check this feature. It makes the living room more spacious. This bedroom connects to the terrace. You get natural light pretty much all day. Yes. When could I move in? This month. -Excuse me. One second. -Please. Hi. Hi, how are you? Fine. I'm looking at a flat. Oh, let's talk later then. Needed anything? No. Just wanted to talk. Shall we go out for lunch? I'd love to, but I have to stay home. Well, I can come over. I can grab some food. Japanese? -Do you really want to come over? -Of course. Why else would I ask? Send me the address and I'll be there in 30 minutes. OK. Hi. Hi, it's Julián. It's open. Hi? Hi. Wait in the living room, please. I'll finish feeding my dad. OK. And why so far from where you live now? Firstly, it's closer to work, I'd been thinking for a while that... it feels good to go to the office more often and see Sandra and the rest of my colleagues. That's important, yes. And secondly? Secondly, I've been living in the same house for many years, in the same neighbourhood, and I wanted to feel as though I lived in a different city, without leaving Madrid. -I haven't seen a lot of Madrid. -No? The theme park, for example. -I hate the theme park. -How come? When I was a kid, I got lost on a ride. Well, I didn't get lost, I sneaked into the other side of a ride. It was a space ride that I really liked, and... I guess I thought I'd love to stay there forever. My dad always waited outside the rides. He never joined me. And one of those times when I was alone, I got off the little car... I thought I had got off a moving car. And your dad got angry? My dad never got angry. What I remember most is my feeling of disappointment when finding out it wasn't real. Seeing the other side full of wires and papier mâché... I found that really sad. It was like suddenly growing up. I think I suddenly grew up when I found out that Videodrome wasn't actually the film I had seen. What film did you see then? A porn film. I don't believe you. My dad kept it in the Videodrome case because he didn't know I secretly watched horror films. And my mum's not a Cronenberg fan. The thing is, while I watched it, I thought I was watching a sci-fi film. I was shocked when I finally found out it was all real, that we could actually do that with our bodies. Sci-fi. -Hello. -Hello. Excuse me, are you moving out? Yes. It was all kind of rushed. Careful. It was all rushed. I'd been thinking for a while that I needed more room to work and I found a cheap place. -So, you're leaving the flat today? -Yes, today. What a shame. Why? Nothing serious. Cristian mentioned that he wanted to perform for you. Oh, really? He's like that. He's a sensitive kid. He was really excited. I can come over another day. -Yeah? -Of course. -Could you do that? It would be amazing. -Yes. Are you leaving right now? He's about to get back from swimming. Perhaps you want to say goodbye? I'd love to, but we're in a hurry because I have a parking permit until 5 p.m., you know? Yes. I won't take up any more of your time. Let's talk soon and we'll set it up. -Great, sure. -Well then. -Ciao. -I hope the move goes well. -Thanks. -Thank you so much for everything. -You're welcome. I'll be forever grateful. It's OK. Have you ever visited Barcelona? Yes, a couple of times. Just attending conventions, not leaving the hotel. And wouldn't you want to go back to see the city? I don't know. I don't like travelling. I love it. How's it going with your dad? What? Taking care of him all alone. I'm not alone. Well, right, but... you end up spending a lot of your time taking care of him. Sorry, I didn't... I was just curious about how you dealt with it. My dad came to Madrid when he separated from my mum. Five years ago. I stayed in Barcelona and started my degree. But... I didn't really like my life over there. It's where I had lived forever, but I suddenly felt... completely out of place, as if something was missing. My dad had his stroke and I came to Madrid to take care of him. At first, it was provisional, but one day I found myself standing in the middle of nowhere with the person I loved the most... and everything was OK. Everything's OK. It's perfect, Julián. It's absolutely terrifying. Thank you. -Hello. -Hello. Is this a bad time? No, I was having dinner. -May I come in? -Yes, of course. Is everything OK? Yes, I had a row with Elias and I didn't know where else to go. Sure, don't worry, I wasn't really doing anything. Have you had dinner? Yes, I had dinner. So, what happened? Well... He called me to meet up, all friendly. We were having a beer, and that thing was brought up. He wanted to clear things up, as I said I wouldn't go out, but I ended up going out. And when I met him I told him I was with you. And he got jealous But he of course won't admit it. But you know what bothers me? Instead of getting angry or accusing me of lying, he asks me, "Are you OK?" It wasn't a sincere "Are you OK?" It was a shitty one. One meaning: "You're not OK, but I'm OK, therefore I know you're not OK." OK. Shit, shit. I got it, I got it. Almost. -No! -Shit! Fuck. Well, I'll leave you alone now. No, you're far from home. You can sleep over. -I don't want to bother. -You're not. OK. I can sleep here. On the sofa? No. I'll sleep on the sofa, you'll sleep in my room. Thanks. You can sleep with me. Up to you, if you want company. Oh, no. I'm fine. It's so that you don't sleep on the sofa. No, the sofa's fine. Hey, do you have a T-shirt? Yeah, sure. Here. Thanks. Rest well. Good night. Good night. Come. Be gentle, please. Hold on. Sorry. Adela, what's wrong? Yes. What's wrong? My dad just died. I'm sorry. I should have been there. You couldn't have known. Sandra, what's up? How are you? Yes, I know. That's why I'm calling. She must be really busy. I don't want to bother. Know where's the funeral home? OK, thanks. I'm so sorry. I'm the one who's sorry. Don't leave, please. I don't want to go home. Let's go to my place. No, I don't want to be in Madrid. I don't want to stay with either my mum or her husband. I don't feel like being with them. I don't feel like seeing my mum secretly sorting out my dad's stuff. I can't. You don't have to be in Madrid if you don't want to. You can go anywhere you want. I want to go to my father's village. Excuse me, we're changing destination. We're heading to Atocha station. I am so sorry to hear about your father. My mother lives here now, but my boyfriend and I come here for a month in summer. We kept the original plants. It's basically all the same. Sorry. Are you all right? I can't breathe. What's wrong? You're scaring me. I think it's an anxiety attack. Have you ever had one before? Yes. Are you on anti-anxiety medication? -Yes. -OK. Do you have it here? No, it's in Madrid. Julián. Julián. Close your eyes. -No. Yes. Trust me. You'll be fine. -I can't... Trust me, OK? Breathe. Breathe. OK. I'm really scared. Scared of? Of dying. Dying isn't that easy. Stay with me, please. -Hello? -Julián? Speaking. It's Raúl Blasco, head of HR at KoboGames. I'm calling you because we'd like to meet first thing tomorrow morning. Is everything OK? Yes. The new projects are moving forward and we'd like to specify your role in them. We'd like to discuss this in advance. OK. I usually talk about this directly with Óscar or Sandra. The company has decided to do it this way now. For your sake, to have it all agreed. Sure. Shall we schedule the meeting for 10 a.m.? OK, great. Great. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. -Hi. -Good morning. -How are you? -Fine. I have a meeting with Raúl from HR. Yes, they're waiting for you in the small room. OK. Sandra. -Hello, Julián. -Hello. How are you? Fine, and you? Quite busy, fortunately. Do you want some coffee, water? No, I'm good. Thanks. Before telling you why we wanted to see you, I wanted to personally tell you that I think you're one of the company's most talented professionals ever. Thanks. Raúl mentioned you wanted to specify my role in the 2020 projects. Right. That's why we're here. I want you to know that we, the production company, are going to deal with this issue with the utmost discretion. What issue? Our socials team suggested posting a making-of a while ago on the company's social networks. We've been reviewing everyone's work material, and when we got to your computer, we found a personal project. As you know, the PC you work on belongs to the company. All your work is monitored and stored on the company's server. My external drives too? We didn't access your external drives. We have access to everything you do on the modelling software. We record and store it. It's in your contract, Julián. KoboGames can't allow our name and software to be used to create non-company work. The company's security will walk you home and take the PC. Hey, I've been calling all morning, I haven't heard from you. I was thinking about going to town to buy comics, Junji Ito's new piece is out, and I thought I could grab some Japanese and stop by your place. Call me when you get a chance and we'll talk. Kisses. Did you like eel? Last time we had Japanese you mentioned you didn't like something, and I'm not sure if that was eel. It's so I don't get that. Call me to confirm, OK? All right. Kisses. Hello. Hi. May I come in? I got food. I'm studying right now. Have you eaten? Well, I had a snack. Well, you still have to eat, right? I got two sushi trays. They didn't have sea urchin, it's out of season, I always forget. I didn't get eel either. I wasn't sure if you liked it or not. I've been calling all morning, and I got worried because you didn't answer. I've been calling all morning, you know? Yes. I was studying and didn't have my phone. -Have a lot of studying to do? -Yes. Well, let's eat quickly and I'll leave. I don't want to take up your time. OK. What are you on now? Huh? What are you studying now? Well, I was reading about Alfonso Ponce de León. Oh. Who's that? He was a painter from the early 20th century. He made a self-portrait of himself going through his car's windscreen, and... he died the same year he painted it. What's wrong? I saw your drawing of the boy. I've never hurt anyone. The drawing's not real. But I am. I can't be with you. I think you should leave. Please. Please, don't leave me. Please. I'm sorry. You make me sick. Leave. Yes? Cristian? Who is it? It's Julián. Hi. You still remember me, right? Yes. Is your mum home? She's working. When is she back? At 5 p.m. Oh, that's right. I was in the neighbourhood and thought I'd come up and say hi. I didn't get to say goodbye. But she won't be back for a while... Your mum told me you've become a better piano player, is that so? Yes. Want me to come up and listen to you rehearse while we wait for her? The thing is... if you don't want to, that's fine. I want to. I'm not allowed to let people in when she's not here. Of course. But she mentioned you wanted to perform for me. Or was that a secret? And I just spilt the beans? Or perhaps your mum lied? It's true. So if she said that, she won't mind me coming up. I'll explain it to her when she gets back from work. What do you say? OK. Hi, Cristian. Hi. -Hi. -Is it me or are you taller? -One centimetre taller. -Has anyone moved into my old place? -Not yet, I think. I don't have nice neighbours like you at my new place. It kind of sucks. I enjoyed listening to you rehearse. Remember the day of the fire? I was really frightened that day. I don't like telling anyone because... I feel ashamed of that, but I can tell you that, right? You're my friend. Do you have many friends? True friends, just two. Make it three with me. Know the most important thing about having friends? -What? -Trust. Having secrets with your friends. We can have secrets, rights? Besties' secrets. Our secrets. I was just thinking... I've been out all day, I'm starving. Fancy a hot chocolate? -OK. -Yeah? Can you show me where it is? -Yes. Let's make some. Here's the milk. Here are the cups, and here's the cocoa powder. Let's do this, I'll make it and... you focus yourself. I've heard great pianists need to focus before a concert. -OK. -Yeah? All ready! Damn. I'll have to leave before your mum gets back. I had something to do, I'd forgotten. Damn... But, if you want, I can listen to you play, and then I'll leave. How about that? Yeah? So, I think it's best we don't tell your mum anything... because she'll get mad if I can't tell her myself. That'll be our secret, OK? Our besties' secret. Promise this stays between us? -Yes. -Yeah? OK, show me what you've learnt. Shall I take you to bed? Hello Julián. My name is Carolina Onte, and I'm the chief of surgery at San Gabriel Hospital, which is where you are right now. You may feel a bit confused. That's because of the painkillers. Two weeks ago, you jumped out of a window and suffered several injuries. The most serious of all to the spine, which has caused an irreversible spinal-cord injury. If you can't feel your limbs, that's the reason. Over these weeks, we've performed several operations on the spine and the brain, and more are needed. That's why you're placed upside down. Someone's been by your side all these days. Come in, please. I'll leave you alone. Hi. I spoke to Sandra on Zoom. She sends her best regards. She recommended a horror film. It's about a man who goes on a trip and when he gets back home, he discovers a door that wasn't there before. And he asks his family, and everyone remembers it except him. I told her to stop spoiling because I want us to see it tonight. Your hair's long. I'll cut it tomorrow.
