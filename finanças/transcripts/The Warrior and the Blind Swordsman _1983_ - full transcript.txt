Fire! What kind of weapon are they using? - Help! - Help! Help! So, you won't tell me where Jaka Sembung is? Would you really prefer to die? Take aim! Jaka Sembung! - Long live Jaka Sembung! - Long live Jaka Sembung! Long live Jaka Sembung! - Long live Jaka Sembung! - Long live Jaka Sembung! - Long live Jaka Sembung! - Long live Jaka Sembung! Open the gate. Come! Come here! Come and put him inside. - Who did this? - Jaka Sembung. He's dead. Damn it. This is because of that mad goat, Jaka Sembung. If you let him do things the way he likes, then you will suffer the same fate as Capt. Van Schram and Capt. Nicole. - That means you will suffer next. - What? - I mean, Captain... - How dare you? Go away! Captain, what should we do? We'll hold a tournament. We need native martial arts experts to destroy Jaka Sembung. The winner... will be rewarded with 100 ringgit. My friend Death Claws, I will have to kill you. And then you will receive a special assignment. You will have to catch Jaka Sembung, dead or alive. You'll be rewarded with 500 ringgit for that. Are you ready? Let's start. - Watch out. - Watch out. Watch out. That will hurt. Step back. Step aside. You! Let's brawl! Do you want to be beaten by my deadly claws? Step back! Wait for your turn! Come on! Come forward, all of you! Watch out. Accept your defeat, my friend. Stand back. Fight him. Come on, fight! - Keep it up! - Come on, fight! Come on! Fight him! Here. - Watch out. Step aside. - Watch out. Give me my 100 ringgit. It's the blind warrior. He wants to fight! I'm sorry. Way to go, blind warrior! My name is Soca. Soca Indrasukma, the blind warrior from the evil mountain. "The blind warrior from the evil mountain"? We've heard that name before. I may be blind, but I can see things through my pores. You won't break your promise, right? No. Soca, you said that you sympathize with Jaka Sembung. I'm doing this for the reward. Come with us. You're going too far, Soca. - This is my business. - Let's go. - Who are you looking for, ma'am? - No one. Get lost. What do you want, sir? I want the head of Jaka Sembung. 500 ringgit awaits you. - That's tough. - What? What about 1,000 ringgit? - What's the matter? Are you doubting us? - No. - No. - Okay, then you should go now. - Lieutenant. - Yes, Captain. Prepare the troops. Have them protect him. - That's not necessary. - Hey, you... - Let me go by myself. - It's mandatory here. It's for your safety. - Let's go. - All right. All right, then. Check this place. Let's check. Let's check. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I just thought the corpses of your fellow soldiers got dumped in the river. - Come here! - Pick them up! - Come here. - Soca! - Be careful. - Carry them. Soca! Do you hear the goats? They're at the banana plantation. Wait. Wait a second. Wait. No! Hold it right here. Jaka! Show yourself! Come out! I want your head! Come out! Soca! If you want my head, I'm here! But I might end up chopping off your head instead. Charge! No, don't waste ammunition. It's quite expensive. Kill him! Kill that blind warrior! Kill him! Back off! Back off! Back off! Turn right. - He's here, Captain. - Okay. Do you still have doubts? Look closely. Well done. Thank you. Belly, mount this jerk's head on the front gate. Yes, Captain. Captain. Where's my 1,000 ringgit? Of course. Lieutenant. And then... Don't worry. I, Capt. De Mandes, am not a liar. It's all real money. Thank you, Captain. I've already finished my job, so I'll be leaving now. But... If you need me, just hold another tournament. I will definitely come. What's the matter, Captain? Nothing. You know what 1,000 ringgit means to us. That amount of money could support the entire army in this fort for a whole year. We could also use it to buy a cargo of ammunition. I understand what you're implying, Captain. Well, what are you waiting for? You already know what to do. Fire! Come! Let's finish him! I know you got hit, but I don't want to take any risks. Surrender yourself. I could bring another battalion to catch you and kill you. What's important is you hand over the money. Hurry! You're such a liar. You're very cunning. I can be a liar too. Let's be cunning in our dealings with one another. Soca! What is that smell? Relax, Soca. This medicine will heal your wounds. I've been waiting for this moment, Soca. If you're not in good condition, I can't get my hands on your body. Magi. What are you doing? I love you. That's why I've been following you around. No! Don't do that, Magi! You are indeed blind. It's not just your eyes that can't see. It's your heart too. Can't you feel how much I love you? No! Magi, I've already told you before. My heart belongs to someone else. My love is buried with my lover who's already gone. - I'm so sorry, Magi. - So you're refusing my love? All right. But you have to give me the money to make it up to me. All right, I'll give you half of it since you helped me. I want all of it. What for? Jaka Sembung isn't the only one who needs money for his dojo. I need money for my dojo too. - Hand over the money to me. - No, Magi. Damn you! Give me the money. Hurry! Soca, you're so ungrateful. What a jerk! I will make you paralyzed for the rest of your life. - It's poison. - My goodness. It's Goddess Magi. This chest is from the military unit. There are a lot of dead soldiers up there. What is going on? Who is he? If I'm not mistaken, he's Soca Indrasukma. He's the blind warrior from the evil mountain. Praise God. There's a total of 1,000 ringgit. I'm sure this is the reward for my head. - That's correct, Jaka. - Right. But I don't understand. Why did he have the money? And what's his relationship with Goddess Magi? This is a big puzzle. Grandpa, he's awake. Where am I? You're safe here. Don't worry. Relax. I'm Jaka Sembung's teacher. And I'm Kinong, Jaka Sembung's little sister. That's Jaka. Your wounds have healed, so you'll be as good as new. Thank you. Oh, right. Where's the chest? - Did you keep it safe? - Yes, I did. Don't worry. Praise God. I hope the money will be useful for your efforts, Jaka Sembung. This will be very meaningful. Thank you for your sacrifice. What did you say? Repeat that. A goat's head? Yes. If you don't believe me, see it for yourself. Go ahead. That's clearly Jaka Sembung's head. I think you're mistaken. You're the one who's mistaken. Take a good look at it. - Soldier. - Yes, Captain. Please tell me what you're guarding. It's Jaka Sembung's head, Captain. Take a good look again. - It's a goat's head. - What? Captain, it's a goat. So, you gave them a goat's head and got that money in return? Yes, with the help of Goddess Magi's magic. It's just like the story of Prophet Ibrahim. This means the blind warrior tricked me. You and he are even, sir. He may have tricked you, but you also betrayed him. Enough! This has nothing to do with you. This is between me and that man. I'm so sorry. Let me ask you this. Can you help us? That depends, sir. What will you offer me if I defeat Jaka Sembung and the blind warrior? Show me what you've got first, then we can start negotiating. - What's going on, sir? - I don't know. Looks like you're a talented magician. Lady? Where are you, lady? You can choose which eye will be shot by this bullet. Raise your hands! Raise them higher! Don't do it, lady. Lady. What if your head was inside that hat? Lady? That's enough. You've already convinced me. What do you say? Let me ask you again. What will you offer me if I defeat Jaka Sembung and the blind warrior? Besides money and an assurance of safety for your dojo, I will give you a territory that you can manage. Agreed? - Agreed. - Agreed. Good. I'm relieved to know that you understand our deal with the military unit. If we don't cooperate with them, where else will we get blood? Goddess Magi, please let me go home. Please help me. Why do you want to go home? You will feel more comfortable here. You're the only man here. You're the man we've chosen. You're not just my lover. You're also the lover of all my siblings. At least you can get a massage from all of them. Isn't this an honor for you? - An honor? - Yes. You threw me here and there as your stud. Is that truly an honor? Do you think I'm an animal? Even so, you're the man we've chosen for now. Make use of this opportunity while you can. When Jaka Sembung and Soca Indrasukma become our prisoners, you will lose us forever. Get out! How dare you peek at your mistress? Get out! Hurry! Madam Magi! Madam Magi! Madam Magi. What's going on? What happened to you? Madam Magi, we've been humiliated by Jaka Sembung and the blind warrior. Look at us. Silence! Madam Magi. - Please assign us to them. - That's right. We must avenge them for this humiliation. - That's true, Madam Magi. - All right. If I heard it correctly, you also mentioned the blind warrior. Yes, madam. That arrogant blind warrior was there too? - Yes. - Is he now working with Jaka Sembung? Yes, madam. He was the one who harmed us. All right, then. Satria! If that's the case, I will go there. Madam Magi, what should we do with this stud? Just take that handsome fool to satisfy all of you. Do whatever you want with him. After that, you can throw him away. Hey, why did you blow on the flame? - Who blew on it? It got bigger by itself. - See that? Enough! Stop fighting. You always accuse me. Here's some water. Pour it onto the flame. Why did it get smaller by itself? Why did you push me? Who pushed you? You fell on your own. You! Enough. Stop fighting. - It's magic. - The chest is outside. That's magic. What's going on? It's dangerous. - Wait! - Attack! Wait! Soca. We don't see anyone. Who is doing this? I can only hear footsteps... and someone breathing. I also smell a wonderful aroma. If you can't see who's doing this, then he or she must be using the disappearing technique. Goddess Magi. You're right. Come on! Wait. Don't attack. Attack her! - Let's go! - Come on! - Come on. - Surround her. Attack her! Come on. Jaka, she's already powerless. Let her go. Poor her. Master. Don't you see that I'm suffering, Master? I need your help, Master. Magi. You've been restored to perfect health. Thank you, Master. Now, tell me what you want me to do. Please get Kinong for me. What for? To catch a fish, we need bait. Isn't that right, Master? Two fresh fish. Mr. Soca. Come here, little girl. Come, little girl. Come here, sweetheart. - Did you call me, ma'am? - Yes. Stay here for a moment, kid. - What's the matter? - Kinong. - How do you know my name? - Why wouldn't I? You're quite popular here, Kinong. - Right? - Right. - I'm famous, ma'am? - Yes. Who wouldn't recognize Jaka Sembung's little sister? - Right? - Right. - Jaka Sembung is famous, right? - Right. Kinong. - Let's go to my house. - Where is that? - My house is over there. - Over there. - We have sweet fruit. Do you want some? - Yes. - Okay, let's go. - Let's go. Let's take Mr. Soca with us. - That's him. - We'll invite him later. - Mr. Soca. - He'll join us later. - Mr. Soca. - Kinong! Kinong! Kinong, stay away from these people. Hurry up! We're nice people. - I'm so sorry. Here's Kinong. - Kinong. We don't mean any harm. Mr. Soca. Magi, catch her! Let me go! Leave, Magi. Hurry! - Mr. Soca. - Kinong. You chose to despise me instead of loving me. - Magi! - Sir! Kinong. Kinong! Kinong! - Kinong! - Master, wait. Hurry. Kinong! Kinong! Kinong! Kinong. Kinong. Kinong! Kinong! Soca! Soca, what's the matter? Kinong has been kidnapped. - Who did it? - Goddess Magi and an old man. - An old man? - Yes. He's definitely her master. He's very powerful. All right, I will try to chase them. - Jaka, let's go together. - No! Let me go by myself. Everyone, go home. Tell Master that we need to strategize and plan our attack. Let go of me! Let me go! Magi. - I've already fulfilled your wish. - Thank you, Master. - I will go now. - Go ahead, Master. Madam Magi. What should we do with this child? - Take her to the Death Well. - Let's go. Move! Keep walking! Take her there. Hurry up. Quick. Let go of me! - Let go of me! - Quick. Keep walking. - Red, Purple, prepare the ropes. - All right. Be quiet! - Tie that kid up, quickly! - Goddess Magi. Did you take advantage of this kid too? She's a girl, dummy! You're disgusting, you crazy woman. You're disgusting. Why haven't you killed him yet? Didn't I tell you to throw him into the Death Well once your needs have been satisfied? Kill him. You evil women are really unstoppable. Kill him! Now it's her turn. Tie her up. - Let's go. - No, don't. Don't! Jaka. Jaka. Jaka. Jaka. Jaka! Watch out! Jaka! If you take another step, those arrows will pierce your sister's stomach. Welcome, handsome warrior. You don't want Kinong to die in vain, right? You're so cunning. This is the only way I could bring you here. Goddess Magi, what do you want? We want to have you as our mighty stud. - What do you mean? - We need you to satisfy us. You're disgusting. If you refuse, Kinong will die. We'll throw her into this well, and the snakes will feast on her. You lunatic! If you attack us again, your sister will die. I will cut this rope. Fine. I won't attack you. But please release her. She has nothing to do with this. She will stay there until you've met our demands. No, I won't serve you. What? I'll give you some time to think. White! Purple! Don't oppose us if you want Kinong to be safe. If she moves, shoot her with arrows. You don't have to wait for my command. Yes, Madam Magi. Jaka. What is the situation? We need to split up. I will release Kinong from the Death Well while you release Jaka. Where is Jaka? He's pinned to the mountain wall on your left side. Below. Wait a second, Master. Jaka! Soca! I have located his position. Soca, wait! - Jair. - Yes, Master. Assign your people to secure the perimeter and assign archers to stay next to me. Put that bamboo in front of me. Sila, Juju. Bring that bamboo to the front with three other guys. I need the rest of you to spread out. The three of you, get back. Sila, get out of there. Juju. Aim your arrow at that hoist. Once the bamboo is where Kinong is, you need to release your arrows accurately. Jair, when Kinong is on the bamboo, signal everyone to attack. - Charge! - Let's go! Attack! Kinong! - Ipung! Take Kinong to safety. - All right. Hurry. Wait! Don't just go there right away. We need a strategy. - White. - Yes, madam? - Call Master. We need his help. - Yes, madam. Green, Red, Purple. Hold them off as long as you can. I will contact the military unit. All right, madam. Be careful. They're shape-shifters. Someone's need is someone else's bread. In this case, their need is our bread. What were you saying earlier? I asked them to prepare the cannon. Napoleon said lightning is the only thing that can match the power of cannons. Enough of that. Let's go now. Troops, march! White. Long live Jaka Sembung! - Sorry, Master. - Jaka. Drive your sword into the ground, then chop off his tail. Get back! Soca, get back! Get back! Get down! Get back! Stay away from the corpse. Get back! Hurry up! Master! Wait a second! Please wait. - My master is there. Don't shoot. - Be quiet! Attack them! Get back! - Take cover. - Retreat! Watch out! Move in! Get ready to attack! Look. - Attack them! - Charge! - Let's go! - Attack! Damn it, you infidels! Forgive me! This is terrible. Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Curse you, Dutchman! You're such a liar! - You're a liar, you cunning fox! - Soldiers! Forward! - Fire! - You're so cunning! You jerks! - Master. - Master. - Master! - Master, hang in there! Reload the cannon. - We need to stop the cannon. - That's right, Jaka. - Right now. - No, don't! It's dangerous, Soca. It's not, Master. Let's go. Soca! - Master! - No, don't! Soca, watch out! Soca! Aim the cannon toward them. That was only a small bullet. It wasn't even a cannonball. What do you want to do? Do you want to dodge this? If so, your master and that girl will die. They will be blown to pieces. Even though you guys are great at martial arts, you are no match for this cannonball. Farewell, foolish warriors. Captain. Magi. Magi, there's still kindness in your heart. Yes. At least I did something meaningful for our nation. But it's a shame that I am meaningless to you. - Magi. - Enough! I know what you're going to say. You'll say that your heart... already belongs to someone else. The only person you can love is your lover who has passed away, right? Liar. You're a conman. You're a heartless man. You're a coward! - Get down! - Magi! Magi. Magi... THE END
