I play center mid for New York City Football Club, and I'm 17-years-old. This is the a park by my house, just a couple of blocks down that I would come to play with my friends all the time. Whenever I was bored, I would just come out here, play with 10 guys, pickup games. This is the field we would play on. We would just put maybe two bags right here to make the goals, then we would play with 10 people, five versus five, maybe six versus six, in this small little space. [GIRL] Can I take a picture with you? [JUSTIN] Yeah. Thank you. Justin's a great story. He was here from our original team back in 2014, and you know, he's a kid from Brooklyn. It's exciting, he's our first academy player that we signed from the city, and I think he's earned it. So I started playing soccer when I was about five, six-years old at Chelsea Piers. I was doing gymnastics, and then I broke my arm there, so my dad took me over to soccer and that's when I started. As soon as I started playing soccer, I think I just fell in love with the game. (GROUP CHEERS) As soon as he joined us he was this kid who had tremendous passion for learning, for absorbing, for competing. He wore the New York City badge and continues to with great pride, and we just see him from really 11, 12-years-old in the area, and now to what he is today. He's almost a young man playing out here with the first team players, is really a tribute to him and our academy together for the combined work and his dedication. After the first training center, one of the coaches told me, "If you keep playing like that, we'll see you a lot more of you." After a couple of months, I was invited to actually join. That's a neat milestone. Justin's our first New York City, five-borough boy that signed for the first team. He knows here he's in a family that's gonna take care of him and push him, and develop him, but he's at a great place with great teammates that are gonna help mentor him and develop his game. (PLAYERS LAUGHING) When I walk onto the field, it's a little more than I expected, especially the first time. You nervous? Yeah. Why? 'Cause I never done this. Enjoy it, my friend. As the game grows, less and less players will fall through the cracks. The opportunity that a lot of the academies are opening for players of all different backgrounds, they're offering these players a place, an opportunity, a scholarship if you will, as close to a professional level as you can get for a 14, 15-year-old. [ANNOUNCER] Number 80, Justin Haak. (CROWD CHEERS) The fans, they're so great in Yankee Stadium, and it's a surreal experience. I think the cities in the United States have a lot of good players. It's just finding the players, like for example, this club and NYCFC is doing a really good job, and only this is now the fourth year of the academy, and we've already had three home-grown signings, so I think we're taking steps in the right direction. To a little kid that's looking to be a professional, I would say it's important to always believe in yourself. If you do that, nobody can stop you, and it's important to work every day. You can't take days off and think, oh, I'm just gonna relax today 'cause tomorrow I can train. You always have to work every day. (UPTEMPO SYNTH MUSIC) Collectively at five, pass and move, pass and move. Give me a airplane, you are the tail. [NARRATOR] Lincoln Phillips for over five decades, he's been playing, coaching, and keeping a close eye on soccer in America. The game is played in a hectic, stressful situation, the players all around you, and it causes a lot of stress. And we should train within the same environment. [NARRATOR] During much of the 20th century, attempts to popularize soccer in America were often an exercise in futility. Leagues started, failed, and then new leagues would take their place, destined for the same outcome. Even while soccer remained a passion amongst immigrant and working class communities, it could not break through into the American sports mainstream. Immigrants, already seeing the game, it started catching on, you know you had the son of the immigrant, he started to play. In 1968, a recreational league got together and it was formed into the North American Soccer League. The game was played in quarters and you had a vibrant league. The soccer was excellent because you had these guys playing the soccer and so on, but it was not vogue. It was not in the schools. And from '68 it went like this and then it fizzled out because people started losing money. They decided to bring in some big name people. And they brought in Pele. [NARRATOR] In 1975, Edson Arantes do Nascimento came to America, better known as Pele, this international superstar, and three-time World Cup winner, was brought in to deliver a much needed shot in the arm to the game, stateside. Pele single-handedly, single-handedly because the year before Pele came, we had about maybe 3000 came to see the Yanks play. When Pele came the following year, they went to Europe, 69,000 people showed up because Pele was there. Pele was a good pioneer but unfortunately in building the game, Pele was never taken to the inner cities. [NARRATOR] When Pele retired for the second time, just three years after signing with the New York Cosmos, professional soccer in the US faded once more into the background of American sports. A brief revival during the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles helped put soccer in the headlines, but it was short lived, dying again later that year, along with the North American Soccer League. Then, on the Fourth of July, 1988, FIFA made the controversial decision to give the 1994 World Cup to the United States. The US had beaten out Brazil and Morocco for the right to host the tournament, and FIFA was widely criticized. One journalist even compared the decision to holding a major skiing competition in an African country. But FIFA, wanted to help reinvigorate soccer in America. The 1994 World Cup took place in a nation that was just coming out of the Cold War. Spurred by patriotism and pageantry, Americans took notice of the tournament, and their team rewarded them, delivering several iconic moments including a two-one victory against tournament favorite, Colombia, resulting in flag-draped festivities after the game. And we got knocked out by Brazil and I was there at that game in California, you should have seen the people in that stadium. Ah, and it was a good game. And everybody said, hey, I think we can do well. [NARRATOR] Two years later, Major League Soccer was formed with 10 charter teams making up America's newest professional sports league, and the sport finally moved from kid's leagues played on patchy fields, to stadiums full of supporters of the beautiful game. ♪ It's such a good vibration ♪ ♪ It's such a sweet sensation ♪ ♪ It's such a hot temptation ♪ ♪ It's such a ♪ Well a young player today growing up is completely different, you know seeing that pathway, seeing that there's a thriving, professional league in our country gives any young boy or girl that dream of playing soccer, and on top of that, facilities are improving, coaching's improving, the overall knowledge of the game of the young players completely improving from years past. And there is a lot of good young talent in MLS and in the United States and I think we all believe strongly that's there's gonna be even more in the future. [NARRATOR] Soccer in America has continued to expand in popularity as a spectator and participant sport. But even while the game is growing, there remains a divide. American soccer has been largely a suburban pursuit, without real roots in the inner cities. How can soccer's growth in America continue? What is happening today, in soccer, in the cities and in America, what is happening today is because of what took place long ago. It didn't occur in a vacuum. People say, "Why isn't the game catching on in the inner cities?" Okay, when you had a chance to get a guy like Pele, everything was done in the suburbs, everything. The access is the same as when you look at the education system in the inner city, and that dictates everything, whether it is education, whether it is opportunities to play, it affects everything, and we just have to be conscious and depend on organizations who see the need to have some equality. [NARRATOR] Perhaps the biggest challenge for the development of American soccer is equality, an equal chance for kids, urban, rural, or suburban to have the opportunity to play. But for years, the barrier has been overcoming a system that predominates in youth soccer, pay-to-play. For American kids, the opportunity to be seen, to be scouted, and to have a future in soccer, comes with a large price tag. Many of the best leagues and teams cost thousands of dollars per year, pricing out families without the means to pay for their kids to play. Right now, the pay-for-play model is hurting the development of soccer because you just have kids who can't afford it. In no other part of the world do you play soccer like this, where you have to pay so much money, in order to be involved in playing in the organized sport. Other parts of the world, you just get a soccer ball, you go outside and play with it, you find an open space. Here, really to compete you have to pay. You have to spend about $1500 a year, that families are spending annually on soccer. It can go up to $5500. How can people afford that? Particularly, underserved communities? [NARRATOR] How much talent has been left behind without the means to grow, showcase, and make use of their skills. It's fast becoming a transaction sport, transaction versus passion. Parents are saying, oh, I'm gonna pay a little extra because we have to want this kid's college scholarship. The kid is five-years-old, and they're paying for their college scholarship. The pay-to-play system is super baked into development academies, like those are usually much higher price points to get players not just in to that system but on the radar of people who are involved in that world, even though there are supposed to be scouting mechanisms. The pay-for-play model's entrenched here because it's making money for people. I mean, it's a lot of people in sports, youth sports, and it's not just soccer, but soccer has taken it to a high degree. There's a lot of money to be made and it ends up leaving kids behind. How do you, not necessarily dismantle pay-to-play, but do you provide alternative avenues to get players into the world, if not necessarily into the most elite elements of the system. ♪ Wind me up now ♪ ♪ And now wind me up now ♪ ♪ I love it you wind me up ♪ ♪ And now wind me, wind me up now ♪ [NARRATOR] Inroads are being made. Pay-to-play has been vilified, but there exists a middle ground. One in which a viable youth soccer business coexists with opportunities for kids without the economic means to join expensive leagues. [COACH] I need everybody down on the end line, please. So, I played with the Women's National Team. So I wanna encourage all of you to keep playing this game. I love soccer, I've played it since I was six-years-old. It was always the favorite part of my day to run around and kick a soccer ball. Soccer is the most democratic sport in the world, except for the United States of America. We have to get past that model and the way to do that is to give access to kids in the city, and to take out the elite status of soccer from such a young age. If we just give access and opportunity for kids to play from when they're six, seven-years-old. [COACH] Two minutes on this game. Nice shot. I play soccer because I want to learn my skills, so whenever I grow up I can be a professional soccer player. I started playing this in school since I was third grade. I said I wanna try and then if I like it, I'm gonna join next year again. My brother, he played this program as well, and when I was in second grade I started playing soccer, and I thought I just wanted to try it and see how it goes. [NARRATOR] This changing landscape is being led by leagues, teams, dedicated individuals, and organizations, like America Scores. This nationwide non-profit network was started in 1994, in the afterglow of that monumental World Cup, in Washington DC, where it now thrives. DC Scores currently provides free soccer for over 3000 kids throughout the nation's capital, and America Scores now serves over 13000 low-income youths in a dozen North American cities. DC Scores is an inner-city soccer program. Disadvantaged children, almost 100%, that really have no access otherwise to organized sports. So, our mission is to help kids living in poverty get and stay on track, and we do that through a really unique combination of activities that's centered around soccer leagues. Soccer's a sport for everyone, regardless of your experience, your knowledge of the game, it really only takes a ball and barely even a a playing surface. You guy here, looking at me. Where are you going for your shot? Where are you guys going. Sure? Be ready, the next person has to be ready. It's about providing that door-opening opportunity. Making sure that kids know that that's an option for them and that's what we do. There are different opportunities for kids to find a little bit of themselves, figure out why that game matters to them, and be a part of that in their own right. Look at this Harper, look at this Harper, hey Harper. That's it, we call that an assist. We call that an assist around here. For the vast majority of kids, they're not gonna have that opportunity to play pro soccer, right. What we are able to provide is that life-transforming experience, and then the ones who have that talent find soccer. For most of the kids we work with, they don't have access to soccer teams, apart from us. They would never play soccer without a Scores program. So we use soccer as that life-transforming tool. Well, I hope and pray to God that the pay-to-play system goes away. I think in all other countries that soccer is very popular and more importantly, international successful, the majority of those systems and those programs are set up in the opposite way. They go into these neighborhoods and find the best talent, instead of who has the most money. But it's gonna be a tough one. It's not gonna be easy. [NARRATOR] But playing soccer is only part of the equation at Scores. The organization uses a unique combination of soccer, poetry, and service learning to create neighborhood teams, that provide whole child, mind, body growth for its participants. The goal, to give them the confidence and skills to succeed on the playing field, in the classroom, and in life. I am, I am not who you think I am. I am somebody you should get to know. I am sweet, strong, independent, sit back and watch me grow. Yes, I get upset, angry, and mad, but, I'm also capable of making people feel glad. The purpose behind is not to teach them soccer. The purpose is to use soccer as a leverage to teach teamwork but also to encourage literacy. If you don't do well in school you can't be on the team. Nowadays, everything comes with a price. You make one wrong move and you're scarred for the rest of your life. When you're above mediocrity you're bombarded with strife. It's not like sitting down and reading a 1000 page book. They're able to express their feelings through poetry. They're able to get in front of an audience and it helps with their egos and their sense of self. America Scores is a fantastic organization. They marry soccer and poetry together to help kids express themselves, and I think it's an amazing concept and I really enjoyed my time time being an ambassador for them. The reason Scores is so important is because it's not even so much that these kids are gonna go on and you know play at a high level. It's the opportunity and the choice that's given. It's a positive choice. It's a choice that empowers them, and I think every kid that goes through the Scores program comes out more enriched, and more passionate, and feeling like they matter in what they have to say, and what they think and feel matters, and that's the most important thing. Would you believe me if I told you that I fell in love at 10? But not with some charming little boy, but from the words that flow within my young soul, was in the pages of a book with the writing so messy you just wanted to look. [NARRATOR] Brianna Scurry has a long list of illustrious achievements, member of two Gold Medal-winning US Women National Soccer Teams, a world champion with the US Women's Team in 1999, National Soccer Hall of Fame, and former ambassador for America Scores. These are the girls. So this, as you can see, this is the first ever Women's Soccer Olympic Gold Medal. This is 1996 in Atlanta. And then this is 2004 Olympic Games. These games were in Athens, Greece. This is my latest addition, my National Soccer Hall of Fame medal. I was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2017. I take great pride in being a pioneer. There's a saying about how pioneers have the arrows in their backs, but somebody has to blaze the trail, and I think for me one of the biggest gifts of my life is being someone who was on an amazing team of firsts, first ever Women's Olympic Gold Medial, and it's for me to be the first African-American female goalkeeper in the Hall of Fame as well. Somebody has to go first and be that inspiration for all the young kids that look like me, who are coming up behind me to say to them, you know what, she did it, you can do it, and for me, that's what it really means, and that's one of the best parts of my legacy, is I think that I've been well represented as an inspiration over the course of my career and I'm very proud of that, and it's really a great gift for me. [NARRATOR] For Brianna Scurry, being a role model means being an advocate for change and that includes helping provide alternatives to the pay-to-play model that she feels is holding back American soccer success. It has become a sport where if you have money then you can get far. Looking back on my career, I know my parents didn't have a lot of money at all, but I knew because we moved to the suburbs that was where I was even able to get exposure to even play soccer. If we had stayed in the city where we lived when I was up until five-years-old, I probably wouldn't be sitting here right now talking to you, because I don't think soccer would even been on the menu. (GIRLS CHANT) [NARRATOR] Organizations like Scores give kids a safe space to learn, play, and grow, and they are making soccer accessible, teaching life skills and soccer skills, creating a connection between players and coaches, and a connection between city kids and the beautiful game, a lifelong bond benefiting the sport, the cities, and the participants. You're talking about teamwork. You're talking about helping individuals rise from whatever. You're talking about being a family. I think it was three or four years ago, it was right around the poetry slam, and I had a quadruple bypass. While I was in the hospital there was a poetry slam that evening and the children, they committed that performance to their coach. That did more for me more than any hospital or any doctor could have done because they actually won the poetry slam committing their performance to a man that they just felt they could love. (LIVELY UPTEMPO MUSIC) [NARRATOR] Despite the prevalence of pay-to-play soccer programming, organizations like DC Scores and anotherWashington-based team, the Cosmic Wolves, are making a difference in young, inner-city soccer player's lives regardless of their economic means. Come on Sergio, come on Sergio, come on Sergio. Go, go. [NARRATOR] The Cosmic Wolves are a haven for those escaping the grip of local gangs, those who have troubled home lives, or kids who simply need a second chance and a place where they feel safe. More than just providing a safe space, these organizations inevitable discover diamonds in the rough, talented kids who just need an opportunity to play. (SPEAKS SPANISH) (ENGAGING DRAMATIC MUSIC) (UPTEMPO TECHNO MUSIC) After you start doing it for a while, everybody gets it, we're gonna take one down, go. So the Cosmic Wolves started back in 2013 as a team called DC Cosmos. The idea was a bunch of young guys, we just had graduated high school to keep in touch together and playing soccer, and keep away from gangs around that time, 'cause there was a lot of them. And then I thought that you know, playing soccer used to keep our minds busy, so that's how the idea of soccer started. Soccer means life. Most of us, as Hispanic culture the first the thing that we do is start with soccer. So we learn soccer in school. We learn soccer out of school. So, soccer's a part of our life, that's it. And our team is a way for them to come and feel as a family. And I wake up, because by doing soccer and help these young people, we can keep our community safe. I was a member of the gang, so I looking for a lot of opportunity to get out from the gangs, but nobody wants to give me that opportunity because they don't believe me that I'm trying to be a different person, except for one guy, Rubio Gomez. [NARRATOR] For Sergio, opportunity came knocking because the Cosmic Wolves made it possible for him to be seen, and not just by any team, but the prestigious Marcet Football Academy in Spain, which gave him the chance to train with them for two weeks in the summer of 2019. I think that he can really have an outstanding future in soccer if he stays committed, away from what we try to keep him away, concentrate in school, having good grades, and I keep telling him, the path to soccer has to be to go to college. If you want to be known and seen through soccer you have to go study and play in college, and that's when they'll see you. Most other countries, when you look at the way that kids grow up playing soccer it's this sort of unorganized play activity, as opposed to, okay I have practice Tuesdays and Thursdays, from six to seven at night. That sort of thing is just kids with a ball out on a field, or on the beach, or on the streets. (RAPPING IN FRENCH) [NARRATOR] Perhaps the best model for America to look at for an example of on the pitch success, is stemming from incubating talented athletes from inner cities can be found in France, winner of the 2018 World Cup. In need of a reboot of talent for a team that after winning in 1998 and finishing as runners up in 2006, had fallen on hard times, Les Bleus focused on finding gifted youth players from non-traditional backgrounds. Pablo Picasso is my city. It's my neighborhood, it's my home. My background in football started when I was working for the first time, and I was playing for the club of my neighborhood, the club of my city, Nanterre at five, and when I have 16 I play for PSG. I need to stop it because I have two injury, and one in my knee, one in my foot, and after that I stopped football. Football is important here because it's the only thing that kids have to do, you just need a ball, you just need your friends, it's the most important because everybody play football every day. You can play everywhere, in the street, in the park, in the pitch, in front of your tower for different neighborhoods, you don't need coaching, you just need a ball and your friends, and you will spend lot of time play football. Le Monde Est a Nous is my organization in my neighborhood. It means in English, The World is Ours. Yeah, this is the pitch of my first tournament in 2018, with Nike, I keep the line for the kids for make like a pitch. The kids play football everyday here. I want to put the spirit, I want to put the mentality in the kid of my neighborhood. You can have what you want if you want to have it and the world is ours, the world is yours. If you come from this neighborhood, you can have much more because you have nothing. If you want something you have to fight with the world. You can see this window, this is the window of Moise Adilehou, he plays Africa Cup of Nation. He plays on the National Team of Benin. You can see also around 10 kids come from in Pablo Picasso and are on professional clubs in France. And for me Pablo Picasso creates the kind of football. [NARRATOR] One such success story came the northern suburbs of Paris, Riyad Mahrez, a child of Algerian immigrants, Mahrez now stars for both Manchester City and the Algerian National Team. When you come from a neighborhood, poor neighborhood in Paris, or in the world, it's the same. The dream is your way. You don't need the best pitches. You don't need the best coaches. You just need to create some advantage. You just need to give a chance to kids. There's no one answer of okay, well in Europe they do XYZ, in Brazil they're doing all these other things. But I think that there are multiple pathways to discovery for players in other countries that we don't have. I think that scouting is very different. Here, you kind of have to hope or there's scholarships, things like that, it's a much more regimented system. Whereas there I think it's a little bit more locally-driven. US Soccer's big goal is to let's win international games. Let's find the best, elite athletes. If you grow the pool wider, theoretically that's gonna help you. It's just that's never really been their motto, but there are some signs that possibly they could be improving that. [RUBIO] Someone's always behind you, don't mess it up. Every country's got different ways of training and we're doing a good job here. I mean in Europe they've invested in soccer for many, many years and we are in many ways catching up. They certainly have set standards in terms of coaching licenses. What you realize now is that the coaching in MLS is getting much better at academy and professional level, much more sophisticated, you have American coaches working with foreign coaches, and ideas are being shared, and coaches in the US have done a really good job, and we need to continue to learn as well. [NARRATOR] While lack of access to the game may have inhibited soccer development in America, homegrown stars are emerging. American, Christian Pulisic is an international star, and the development of players like Justin Haak, Sergio Zabala and others is proof there are diamonds in the rough waiting to be discovered, and MLS teams, alongside organizations like America Scores are helping enable that discovery. Now, we didn't quality for the World Cup, couple of our teams and so, so what. Italy, some of these teams, at certain times didn't qualify, but does not say the soccer is not developing. Qualifying for the World Cup is not the only criteria for the development of soccer. Come on Pablo, yes Mikey. Now we go back around. Open it up, yes. I think the biggest barrier that we found is lack of organized play in the city itself. There are a ton of kids in this area that aren't playing anywhere, aren't on organized teams, aren't on high schools, but they love the game, they're talented, and they just need an opportunity. So we've tried to partner with some different organizations to really reach out into the different parts of the city, and that's the challenging part of my job, it is to go find those kids, to give them an opportunity, and it is to try really find the next player that can do it for DC and then maybe our national team. Yeah, I think to develop the culture of soccer in this country, we have to do what programs like DC Scores are doing and get into the elementary schools, influence them at a very young age. Give them soccer. Give them another outlet that they have maybe after school where they can come out, they can play, and these kids are gonna remember that for the rest of their lives. Not only that, we're gonna then find a couple needles in the haystack that have that passion and they wanna continue. As we're growing as academies, more and more resources are being put into it. MLS itself has really taken off in terms of viewership, fans, and just becoming a really stable, strong league in the international game. Because it truly takes more than a couple people to make a difference in this area, and there are just so many kids out there that can do it, and we hope to keep pushing and finding the next guys. We have a system where we're giving kids the opportunity to grow from the academy and join the first team at a very young age, and they're like wow, this stuff's possible, and it's given them a dream, it's given them something that they can thrive to be. I think we're doing it the right way and I think, us as Americans we have to embrace that, not try to be the Europeans in the way that they're doing things, each country's different. Every culture is different and I think that we're doing it in a way where one day we will see a difference, we will win a World Cup, and then people are gonna start to say, maybe we should do it the American way. And whether that kid becomes a professional, and a national team player, and plays in a World Cup, or whether it's just an opportunity for the kid to get a full scholarship to college, or to go play in college and get an academic degree, that's still a betterment of the person's life, and that's something we preach from our players all the way through out staff to our club. It's so much easier to do it together than it is it is individually. ♪ Hey, yeah we're just getting started ♪ ♪ Take your fears and let them go ♪ ♪ For the lovers and the brokenhearted ♪ ♪ Take a deep breath ♪ ♪ Make the world a little colorful ♪ It communities like East Harlem, and in the communities where we are working, we see a lot of immigrants, and for them they've come from communities or countries where soccer is a passion and it's their national sport. So for them to come to a new country, not knowing the language, the soccer and the program is a great way to accelerate their assimilation into the country and the community, as well as, learn the language, and soccer is the language they all share, and so we've seen the kids really quickly adapt. Peru, how many players do we have? Listen guys, listen. [BOY] We have six players. You have five? Colombia, you have five as well. [NARRATOR] In New York City, America Scores offers free soccer to thousands of kids, and MLS side NYCFC works tirelessly within all five boroughs of New York, not just to find the next Justin Haak, but to give back to the community, and youth soccer is a tool for youth success and assimilation. One of the programs created by NYCFC to do so is Saturday Night Lights. A big focus for us is trying to identify local, young leaders who can step up, give them the tools, the training, to be the next leaders in their community. What's the setup for the tournament today then? In addition to receiving quality soccer coaching, we also try and provide youth development opportunities, and making sure that they're on pathways to staying on track to graduation. Well, Saturday Night Lights is a collaboration between the District Attorney's Office and New YorkCity FC. It's a program that is delivered through us here in the community and we serve kids in the East Harlem neighborhood, on Friday and Saturday nights, where there's the highest incident of crime in the neighborhood. Paul saw something in me, I guess that I haven't found in myself in a while, and it was that sort of light that I brought to everyone and everyone around me. [GROUP] Teamwork. The only sport really popular in the Bronx is basketball, and growing up as a kid I would always play with my younger brother and then one day I came across this program, it's called Saturday Night Lights, and it changed my life completely. It opened the doors to soccer. I think at my age most people would be like, why are you playing soccer? It's all about basketball. Its' all about softball, that kind of stuff. But now I'm starting to see more girls join more leagues, girls getting the opportunity to just be in a competitive team. One of the things that we like to do with the players is develop their character and things like respect, honesty, more of those character traits. We just try to see what they're lacking and work with them to recognize what they need to improve on. So what's really beautiful about this program, that we have a real mix, and it doesn't matter if you're just starting out to play soccer. It's boys and girls. Our youth who are very competitive play in a travel program. The environment is about safety, and inclusion, respect, and everybody's learning from each other. So it's an excellent player development environment, at the same time being open and inclusive for everybody. There are major barriers, but soccer is thriving here in the inner cities. These kids are play across all of America, it exists. The system of leagues, and tournaments, and travel, those are the barriers, the talent is here. The passion is here, it's always been here. We just got to be creative and resourceful, and think about different ways how we can keep kids off the streets and into positive environments where they can connect with positive role models. That's why we launched the New York City Soccer Initiative, a commitment to build 50 community soccer pitches over five years in the neighborhoods that need them most. [NARRATOR] An area equally as challenging as East Harlem is the South Bronx, home of Yankee Stadium, and youth soccer team, South Bronx United. Formed in 2009 by teacher, Andrew So, SBU gives inner city kids an opportunity to play, to get off the streets, and to develop life and soccer skills, with one of the world's most iconic stadiums, and NYCFC's home field, just feet away from the SBU practice pitch, Andrew So, dreamt big. South Bronx United is a non-profit that's done amazing work for years. They come at it from an incredible heart in terms of trying to help kids in the Bronx have better lives and be off the streets, and youth soccer is that vehicle. We started South Bronx United in 2009 with just a single boy's soccer team for kids ages 12 to 14, and by the fall we had three teams, and by the spring, we realized with so many youth and families asking for a program, that we also started a recreational program and from the beginning served 300 kids that first year. So we've grown significantly since then. And the main thing is that we're not just a soccer program. We're a community based organization that uses soccer and uses the passion that that youth have for the sport, but really to focus on goals around making their lives better. We have 100% graduation rate for our seniors in our SBU Academy program graduating high school, and 94% go on to college. [NARRATOR] Sometimes the results achieved by SBU even eclipse Andrew So's wildest dreams. My name is Prince Amponsah. I play left centerback. My game is mostly to help on more and more of the attacking side, but I'm learning how to be a better defender everyday. I would say my favorite centerback is probably Jerome Boateng, probably because he's also half-Ghanaian. (ENGAGING DRAMATIC MUSIC) I grew up in Accra. My parents are from Kumasi. Just one day we woke up and I guess my parents were like we're going to America, and we got here, and that's pretty much it. I remember I came out here with a friend and we were just playing, and a coach saw me, and he just told me to come on a Saturday to sign up for the recreation program. I remember him on this field when he was seven-years-old and you could tell from that moment that he was special. He was dribbling through everyone that were three, four, five years older than him. There's a handball court around where I live and usually I would go there and just ping the ball against the wall, and that's pretty much how I just learned to have fun by myself. It's usually always open because nobody really comes out here to play handball anyway. I'm usually the only out here with a soccer ball and everybody else is on the basketball court. So it's pretty hard finding somebody who wants to play soccer. Unless you've ever done it, it's hard to imagine and understand the challenges facing moving from a totally different country, a difficult culture, here, not just the United States, but specifically the Bronx, it's a tremendous adjustment, and it's not until they find that first friend, or group that they can really identify that they're really able to feel like they've adjusted. It's like a second language. They make not speak English, but they speak soccer. Truthfully, I always felt I had an edge on people in terms of the game. I would say I wasn't the most talented but I could play, and when I got here I was a bit better than kids here in the beginning, but it all evens out by now, yeah. It's amazing what they do. We've had a relation with them out here at NYCFC from day one, and Prince is one of many great stories, and we just love to see how he's been developing. He's such a great kid and he is someone that we believe also has a future in the game, with his attitude, and his ability as well. But a lot of that and that foundation was at South Bronx who has been doing a great job for many years. It was about four years that I played for South Bronx United and I remember City was beginning a program here, and they had like a U14 team that they started with, and I remember just being invited to training sessions, and just training with the first guys that would play for that team, I was a bit young at that time. So, I remember training with them for about a couple months or so, and then the next year I heard they were making another team, and that's when I got the call to come join the club. It was the happiest day, probably of my life. I felt that I could actually take soccer somewhere. Prince came with a really strong mind and a strong heart, to help him make it through that, and really persevere, and help him adjust to new environments too, 'cause going into the NYCFC Academy with other young people that are very different from him and from different backgrounds required some adjustment for him and he was able to really handle that. Well in five years I see myself playing professional, initially would love to play for the badge, for City, just because it be just amazing to live so close and to play for such a great club, and then the sky's the limit I guess. It's really hard to live in a community where there is a possibility so many things could go wrong, and how that influences all the kids, and all the young boys that are growing, but I like to think of it as a personal choice. Like, if you find something that you truly enjoy and focus on it, I feel like it can alienate you from all the bad things that are happening around your community. Soccer, as it continues to grow, the next big frontier to cross in this country is in urban areas. We are as urban as you get and we're excited about that opportunity and challenge at the same time to help grow the sport, and young players and families moving here from all over the world at the same time, we need investments, long-term commitment in urban areas, in underserved communities, because that is just the responsibility, especially of us as a sporting organization to connect to the community, and if we can find talent, great, but that's not the sole purpose of giving back to the community. (ENGAGING DRAMATIC MUSIC) (UPTEMPO BEATBOXING) [NARRATOR] In Philadelphia, Mark McKenzie and Auston Trusty have taken their city game to the pros, starring for their hometown club, the Philadelphia Union, and also featuring on the US Men's National Team. I know I can depend on him, because he has like, his engine goes, he kinda picks me up, especially days like this when you need that extra push, I can depend on him as well. That's lovely, I appreciate that, bro. Hey come on, don't leave me hanging. [ANNOUNCER] Miller's in the clear, no offside flag. Juan goes down, clean tackle (CROWD CHEERS) The first time I started playing was, I can't remember, it was probably like, three, three or four when I like kicking the ball around. Yeah, it was a bunch of different sports at the time though. So, I was just kinda kicking everything, bats and everything, throwing everything. Oh yeah, I was probably three at the time. I played here. And yeah, it's memories, dude, a lot of games here, a lot of practicing, a lot of touches here. I played everything. I played soccer, I played baseball, I played basketball, and I really big on basketball, for a long time I was real big on baseball too, it was just kind of balancing the seasons, and it got to a point where baseball and soccer, "Oh snap, like which one I gotta do?" [NARRATOR] Both Auston and Mark were identified early as potential pros, and offered spots in the Philadelphia Union Academy. Inner city kids, who would have once shun soccer, are now succeeding at its highest levels. I know, 10 or 15 years ago, they wouldn't be playing soccer right now. Only because the other, more mature sports are set up to handle that, whether it's basketball or football, they've got the programs in place they have the history, they realize where the talent is, and a lot of the talent is inner city. It was definitely a moment where I understood that it was gonna take a lot of sacrifice, especially as a young kid, but I knew that in order for me to achieve my dreams of being a professional, I had to sacrifice; I think going into the academy was when my whole mindset, I wouldn't say shifted, but it definitely went to kickstart constantly progressing, constantly developing, figuring out ways in which I could grow my game. [TRUSTY] I don't think there's a straight pathway and I would say just to keep grinding no matter what. (ENGAGING MUSIC) Well the good thing about being involved with the Philadelphia Union is that the club believes in local talent, and it believes in homegrowns. That when you get these guys, all our guys live in and around the Philadelphia area, most of them live in the city itself, they can see for themselves what the needs are. They can see the love for soccer that the people of Philadelphia have, and so it's really not a problem getting these guys involved, in fact, many of them are on the front foot. They come knocking on our door. They want to be involved in this project from the off. We play off each other, when one guy's lacking, Coach Hermann's like, yo, let's go guys. On the field and the field. [MARK] Exactly. [TRUSTY] It's a brotherhood, it's not the same, it's also the other home growns too, all the young guys, we've all been there and they care about each other. [MARK] The amount together definitely helps as well. [TRUSTY] Yeah. I think everybody has their own path, everybody had different trials to get where we are now, and we're still facing stuff as it is, but I think that's kinda what makes the journey so fun. Philadelphia's got a great history of soccer in the US and many great soccer players have come from Philadelphia. But the reality is, it has been the facilities, the soccer facilities in Philadelphia have been under-invested in for a number of years, and so whilst there are many diverse, rich communities in Philadelphia that love the game of soccer, there are very few places for them to play and practice, in any sort of a quality field. [NARRATOR] A perfect example of the Union's commitment to growing soccer is found in the work at nearby Chester High School. Chester is an impoverished part of the US. It has economic difficulties. And all the difficulties that go alone with economic difficulties The High School at Chester has not had a soccer team for over 30 years; we have a high school in the backyard of an MLS club, who has not fielded a soccer team for over 30 years and we decided that was wrong and that we needed to do something about that, because Chester's full of good athletes, and they were missing out on the opportunity to play soccer. One thing leads into another and we're finding that people want to get involved and help, and most notably, the people of Chester as well. This is not something that we're doing in a vacuum. The Philadelphia Union, they're doing a whole lot. At first they started out with Chester, building a mini pitch in Chester, right outside of school, but also they've actually partnered with the city of Philadelphia to build about 15 mini-pitches, and also two full-sized fields. So I think it's slowly by slowly they're incorporating soccer in the city and growing it, and they realize that potential in the city is, it's big time you know, so it's just kind of growing the game of soccer and growing the team brand. [NARRATOR] Players like Mark and Auston now know what it's like to have fulfilled the dream of playing in professional sports, and they're using their success to give back. Helping kids, helping communities, and just maybe, helping to develop the next wave of homegrown talent. I'm ambassador for a foundation in Wilmington, Delaware, it's called Future Soccer Stars; it's based on inner city kids who don't have access, being that now it's kind of, in a way an expensive sport to play. So, just giving these kids an opportunity to come out, kick the ball, laugh and joke, and get to know 'em a little bit. [MARK] I mean I suppose we're leveraging the power of soccer to bring those communities together, to connect them with each other, with their new city. This is not just about growing the game. It's about personal development and personal growth. Breaking down barriers is important. You know, there's a lot of people in this world, and there were people fighting for me and in order for me to get into this position. If I can be that inspiration for somebody, you know open that door for somebody else, to say, I contributed to that, yeah I've broke down that barrier for the next generation, I will gladly take part. One of the easiest answers for actually catching up, it's not even building more pitches, it's finding more alternate spaces to actually have them playing soccer that might not even be intended for soccer. (BEATBOXING) [NARRATOR] One of the biggest challenges in overcoming pay-to-play and breaking down barriers is accessibility, simply getting kids on the pitch. One city has found a novel solution. Soccer in the Streets is a local, Atlanta, non-profit organization that helps to provide soccer programs for those kids that do not have access to some of the soccer programs that are typically out here in the city. An organization like Soccer in the Streets, where their sole goal is to get kids off of the streets, while doing something productive for them, that's beautiful. One of the biggest barriers by far to kids adopting the sport in urban neighborhoods, is the transportation issue, they can't get to games, they can't get to practices. So we believe by working through transit hubs, like railway stations and using them as a vehicle to get the kids between practice and games, we solve that issue, so why not build a soccer field on a train station rooftop? All of a sudden, you're now making a train station more than just a place to get on a train. It's now a place to play sport and connect with other communities. Soccer in the Streets is like the transit above us, all about connection. One of the histories of transportation and transit is how it has cut through neighborhoods, and we're really looking for to Station Soccer re-knitting, and bringing back together some of the parts of the community that may have been cut through. Let's take, what was a patch of dirt behind a chain link fence and make it a place for kids and the whole community to come together. It's something that makes me very proud, as President of Atlanta United, that we can be doing exactly what our mission statement was for Atlanta United Foundation, which was to try and break down the barrier of entry, so that any youngster in the city can have access to playing soccer. We built the original project at Five Points, which was the central hub space, that was very successful, that that was not in a residential community like the West End. This was an unused space since 1978. Nothing's happened here. We had over 150 kids show up and register for West End United Station Soccer. We're now energized and we want to grow this into other communities that need access. These kids become a product of their environment. So we're trying to build the best environments that they can be proud of. We're giving them connectivity and access that they never had. They'll make friends with folks from new neighborhoods, new communities, so it's just gonna expand their minds and help them become better adults. The crazy idea's never crazy when everyone starts to believe in it. It's the sort of a once in a lifetime opportunity to get this right and make a mark on Atlanta, and hopefully on the country, and possibly on the world.

Rural communities often face the same challenges: lack of access, lack of funds, and lack of opportunity, all of which can lead to the lack of a future for the sport. In Central California, the Chevron Soccer Academy along with Open Goal Project, is helping kids learn about success on the pitch and in the classroom. Open Goal Project started in Washington DC, okay, you guy know where DC is? (GROUP ANSWERS AFFIRMATIVELY) (SPEAKS SPANISH) But we're here and we're excited, and we're passionate about doing what we do. We are focused on making soccer as accessible as possible, and giving high-level soccer opportunities to as many people as possible. We're very fortunate in this country, that we have plenty of fields, and lots of girls and boys who wanna play soccer. What we have right now is a problem of how do we get all of those kids on to the soccer field, and the model of pay-to-play in America excludes a lot young people from participating, and that's now how it should be, and that's why the Chevron Soccer Academy, like we're seeing behind me, is really important, because it allows kids who may not have access to everyday programming, or come out even have a clinic for once in their life to see, how soccer can make them feel. So, like I said yesterday, you knock someone down, you help them up, no matter happens if your win or lose, you're gonna shake hands after your game, right, and then make sure we're respecting the game, respect the coaches, respect your opponents, respect yourselves, okay. On a soccer pitch, it's 11 v 11. Its not 1 v 11, it's not 1 v one, you guys are a team, you have to work together, to get to the end line, to get to the finish line, and that's how great teams win trophies, and medals, and everything else. In our community soccer is used as a venue to escape, understand that the kids that you have now here, you probably have a good 5% that the parents make enough money to survive, and so when they come to play soccer they see it as like, well, it's a relief. It's a venue for them to escape sometimes rude neighborhood, necessities, that otherwise would get 'em into trouble. This plane vs this plane. I'm very narrow here and I'm very big here. So you wanna be as big as you can in the soccer field when you're protecting the ball. In our area, our parents, they work, they leave home maybe at 4:30 in the morning, five in the morning, and they don't get home until like six, seven, some times eight o'clock. So they don't have another other, role models, and so when they come together and they have to work together, and they develop together, then they develop as human beings. You know, life is about problem-solving and so if we can combat learning how to do problem-solving from two angles, stem and soccer, we got a winning combination. What I love about soccer and the Chevron Soccer Academy is that we're not just teaching soccer. We're helping these young people recognize that the lessons that they're learning on the field actually make them brighter stars and shine off the field, because again, we talk about the things that they need in their life. We're kind of sneaking around, and giving life lessons, they don't know it until they look back and go, oh my gosh, I learned so much being on the soccer field. Open Goal's mission and the work that they do totally aligns with our objective of providing access to kids that wanna play soccer, and continue to play it at a high level. So they just seemed like the perfect partner and a really good synergy. [NARRATOR] Success breed success. Open Goal Project was born in Washington, DC, working alongside DC Scores. The non-profit organizations is now making soccer accessible to highly-skilled older kids to help bridge the gap between recreational soccer and elite soccer opportunities. Open Goal's project mission is to really use soccer as a vehicle for growth, and greater life experiences, whether it's on the field or off the field. The boys and girls we work with can really go a lot farther on the field and in life if we're empowering them with the resources that they need to succeed. We essentially found that in Washington DC that the pay-to-play model was excluding a lot of kids, and that a lot of those players are very talented and can affect the overall American soccer landscape in a positive way. So, just to give these kids a platform to reach the next level in soccer and in their lives. We started initially by just fundraising in 2015 for three kids, and now at our sessions we have dozens of kids. Inside of your foot, back to the other side, inside of your foot, very simple. Precious is, a young lady we met, I'd say maybe three years ago. We had heard about her. From the first ball I saw her control, she like controlled it with the outside of her foot. You could just tell immediately that she had something different. My whole family basically plays soccer. Like my mom, she used to pay for a club team in Nigeria. I pay soccer 'cause I've been playing it since I was young. It's always been my passion to further my soccer career and play at the highest level. I knew I had a chance when I led my school team to the championship. So then that's when I was just thinking to myself, like, I'm really good at this sport. Then Amir came out, saw me, and he just helped me. So Izzy would be running this way. I'm this way. Maybe, would she just loop? Somebody should be running into that space. If you're coming this way, she's gonna have to follow you. We helped her get into travel soccer. She now plays for one of the best teams in the area. She's gotten recruited by several Division I schools. I mean, she's still a sophomore in high school. She's at the top of her class, academically. I could go on and on. Like a few local schools, that you'd consider, so do you have your top choices, which are good schools. I would also be happy to see your games a little bit closer. Georgetown, UNC, and UVA, I like UVA. And then you wanna make a next tier, like three schools that you would also go to. I don't think I would actually be playing soccer, at a high level, or probably playing soccer at all, I feel like 'cause I stopped playing soccer for my school at 7th Grade, that was right before Amir hooked me up with, like club teams. I feel I would just be in school just being a regular student, trying to find something else. (INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC) I take my academics really seriously now compared to when I did in middle school years when I just thought school was just something I was forced to go to. But now that I know that in order to be a student-athlete, you need to be a student in order to like, go where you wanna go. So if I beat the defender there, right, and I'm into this space but that second forward is running into that space, do I just go out wide? I know my mom is really proud of me of all the goals that I've accomplished, especially at such a young age. She's not really expressive about it. I'm that type of person as well. I don't really express things. But I know deep down she's really proud of me and how I was able to handle schoolwork and also be flexible with my soccer life. So, I know she's proud. Show you my basketball skills? Have you got some? Yeah, I used to play basketball for Cap City. [AMIR] I've never even seen you shoot a basketball. [PRECIOUS] I'm good at it. [NARRATOR] With programs in place that offer inner city and rural youth the opportunity to play, regardless of finances, to showcase their soccer skills, what needs to happen next? America has taken big steps in leveling the playing field and making soccer for all more than just an expression. Whether it's clubs like NYCFC, the Philadelphia Union, or DC United, or organizations like America Scores, Soccer in the Streets, or South Bronx United, access is being expanded and opportunities are being created. That's really the million dollar question in American soccer is, well first of all do we even need to move beyond the concept of, is soccer a niche sport in America? Hopefully over the next 20, 25 years, maybe it'll take less time than that, We can get into some inner-city and rural communities, give kids access and opportunities at high-level soccer, and then I think that will really change the landscape, and change what our national team looks like, and how we compete against the rest of the world. [NARRATOR] The American women have dominated international play for years, and inevitably the men will eventually, win a World Cup. Everyone is aware of it now, the men not qualifying for the past World Cup was truly a wake up call, and I think people attribute the lack of successes to the fact that we aren't able to get all of these talented kids in the city playing the game of soccer. You're eliminating 60% of the best athletes in this country purely because they don't have the funds to play soccer. There's always going to be talent that goes to other sports, there's always gonna be talent that falls through the cracks, I think it's such a big country, Europe has so many countries where each individual federation can look at just the talent within this small area. You can drive from across the country in two hours. Whereas the US, it's huge, I think there's over 20 million registered players here, a lot of those countries don't even have close to 20 million people. [NARRATOR] But more importantly, soccer, the beautiful game, the world's biggest sport, the most democratic sport is being made available to more American kids, regardless of location, gender, or finances. So I think there's efforts being made by clubs, by grassroots organizations, by non-for-profits, to plant the seed and educate kids. For us, we have that opportunity and potential advantage to get into the city and find the neighborhoods that kids love playing soccer, and help cultivate that a little bit more. I think, expose them earlier to it. Kind of not forcing 'em to play, but having that exposure to the game, it helps a lot. [TRUSTY] I think it's also changing the perception of soccer, it's all changing. I don't think there's another sport that promotes so much emotion on and off the field. It just has so much passion that you can see it in the crowd, you can see it in the players, you can see it, you just feel it. It's a working-class sport. It's a white-collar sport. It's every country, every culture, every ethnicity, it promotes I suppose an emotional passion that's just unparalleled when it comes to other sports. [NARRATOR] When kids find a team, a passion, confidence, coaching, and leadership everyone benefits, no matter when or if success on the field follows. I think the messages keep going. These things take time. Now you have a lot of these folks who have soccer essentially as their religion, who are now moving to the United States, and soccer is something they brought with them, and now is the time to foster that amazing talent, to try to find those diamonds in the rough in places where the American game hasn't been there before. What's also changing I think for soccer in America is we know get the Premier League. We now get to watch all of the best soccer in the world, younger Americans too are saying, that's cool, I'm interested in that, I wanna play that. We're still trying to, like, little kid trying to run up and catch up to its older siblings, and so eventually we're gonna catch 'em, but we're still chasing right now. Soccer and soccer training is not a short time, it's just get down to the game, no pretty drills, no pretty equipment and so on, it's soccer. Let us play soccer (ENGAGING DRAMATIC MUSIC) In 10 years from now, I don't know where I will be, but wherever I go I know that I will have soccer with me, the sport, that shatters barrier and embraces diversity, the sport, that is very much like my city, DC, we live in time with backgrounds, beliefs, politics, can be divisive, where news can confuse and make communities feel indecisive, but DC, like soccer is a space where we're all united to get excited, where collaboration is demanded and by the city it passes, and moves, to make space with the ball, city that will stand tall, to protest the bad call. City of three a days, hustle, early morning to late practices, the city of movers, and shakers, debaters, floppers, and actresses, the city of teamwork makes the dreamwork from traffic to footwork The city of network and net worth from Anacasia to Petworth, a city of cultures, merged together with one goal, to win. A city where a loss feels like a cheap shop to the shin. A city that is the nation's capital, but is international. The city of the level-headed, radical, irrational, from corner kicks to slide tackles, where movements are magical. [ANNOUNCER] Putting one up for Acosta. Goal! [ANNOUNCER] DC United's first ever goal. A city of history, mistakes, growth, and pain, a city of misery, blasts, joy, of gain. A city of mystery and layers, a city of culture and players, a city that is a glaring reflection of me, a city that's a glaring reflection of we. 10 years ago I did not know where I would be, but right now, I'm a city that embraces diversity, 'cause we live in times with backgrounds, beliefs, and politics can be divisive, but DC, like soccer, is this space that we all can feel, united.
