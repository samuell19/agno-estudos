[instrumental music] [birds chirping] [inhales] [music continues] [heart beating] [indistinct chatter] [siren wailing] I knew something like this was gonna happen. Please, stop. She's gonna be okay. Is it there? I knew something like this was gonna happen. Loretta, you can't smoke at a hospital! There are sick people everywhere, and newborns! [Peg sighs] -She awake yet? -Not yet, honey. (Peg) Where's Sharon? Oh, she's getting candy. -Oh, Mom. -Hey! -Brother from another mother. -Hey, man. She ain't awake yet. It's gotta be okay. -Where's Sharon? -I'm right here. -Hey, Sis. -Oh, my God! Hey, where are my Milk Duds? I forgot. Did you get Bea a balloon? I think it has a hole in it. It's okay maybe we can exchange it later. What? What is wrong with you guys? Bea is in a coma. And you guys are talking about balloons and candies. I eat when I get nervous. We never should've let her come back here. Honey, breathe. Honey, breathe. Yeah, breathe. You're not helping. -She's not helping? -You know what, Loretta? Have you ever helped? All you do is criticize. (Bea) I've always felt trapped in this family. But this is whole other level. Usually, when I need to get away, I go for a run. I'd give anything to be able to do that right now. Everyone, remain calm. Alright. Thank you. Now remember, just because Bea can't hear us doesn't mean she can't feel us. Ben's right. We should all say a prayer. Well, that won't work, you're Jewish. Jewish people pray too, Loretta. Well, not like Catholics. And Bea is a Catholic. -No, I'm not. -By blood. Loretta, would you like to say the prayer? -Yes, I would. Thank you. -What's the point? (Bea) If there is a God, he's the one who put me here. Heavenly Father, we humbly beseech you to look down on our Bea and rain a holy vengeance on the goddamn motherfucker who put her in here. God doesn't have to worry about that. 'Cause when I catch who it was I'mma beat the crap out of him. I mean, I got a second degree black belt. -No, he doesn't. -We don't really know. That someone did this to her yet. Okay, this could've been an accident. (Bea) But I don't have any memory of that night. Was it night? Loretta, I swear to God... I told you, that won't work. (Bea) Maybe I can remember what happened if I just think real hard. [upbeat music] (Bea) Okay, new plan. Maybe I should try retracing my steps. But where do you start when the thing you lost is your last memory. [instrumental music] (Bea) Oh! Guess we're starting way back. My parents couldn't wait to have a baby. I said my parents! Hello! Now, that's obviously not them. My parents! Mis padres. The ones who gave me life. Growing up, I was told my parents were special. When I got old enough, I realized that's the word adults use when someone has a disability. My dad was born without a disability but he got hit by a drunk driver when he was 12. After that, his body kept growing but his mind just kind of stayed the same. Part of my mom's brain never fully developed. The doctors said she'd never be able to live on her own. Who's that? Oh, the neighbors recommended him. He looks thirsty. Can I bring him some lemonade? Oh, sure, sweetie. That's nice. Don't let her go out there. -Why not? -Look at her. The part of her brain that makes her horny is still working. Earl! She just wants to give him something to drink. The guy is in a tank top for crying out loud. [lawnmower whirrs] You wanna go on a date? -Sure. -I'm Sharon. I'm Derek. [giggles] Ah, where are you going? To ask my mom if I can go on a date. [inhales deeply] I can't sleep. -Yeah, me neither. -She should be home by now. I can't believe you let her go out with him. Everyone says he is a very nice young man. And she needs to be around people her own age. She's not twenty-one on the inside, Peg. Well, neither is Derek. How do you know? Doris McAllister told me he had a really bad head injury when he was a boy. Doris McAllister also told you that she saw Elvis at a Piggly Wiggly. Well, Sharon deserves this. She deserves to be happy. I know. Don't worry. They just went out for pizza. What's the worst that could happen? [instrumental music] [giggling] I love you, Mrs. Johnson. I love you, Mr. Johnson [Sharon laughing] He gave her my mother's ring. Oh! That's nice. So, um... How-how long was your drive up from Vegas? -Ah, too long. -It was, it was long. Oh, I could imagine. Well, you know, I think it's pretty clear what we need to do. I agree. -We need to get them a divorce. -Sharon needs to be sterilized. Excuse me. I said, "Sharon needs to be sterilized." We can't let 'em procreate. Why on earth would we do that when we can just get them a divorce? Absolutely not. Divorce is a sin. My son's not gonna go to hell because of your trollop of a daughter. -Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! -Excuse me? -I said, my son's-- -Yes, I heard you. I heard you. Look, everyone. Just calm-calm down. Yeah, calm down. Did you hear what she said? I-I did and...she has a point. Ah, it's just I don't think they can take care of a child. Earl, we're not getting Sharon spayed. She's not a goddamn poodle. What choice do we have? Oh, you can get your son neutered. -Mom! That's awful. -Well, that's my point. Your father's the one who wants to get your sister sterilized! Ah, I just said we should consider it. Well, sure, if you want to get sued. Oh, shut up, Hal. No, I'm-I'm just saying. My cousin's a lawyer. Two years ago he worked with a woman who sued her parents for this very thing. They took the poor folks for all they had. Well, then, that's-that's definitely out of the question. -We can't afford that. -Oh, my God, dad! If that's all you care about, why don't you move to North Korea and let the government do it for you? 'Cause I'm not a goddamn communist! Okay, sweetie, sweetie. Maybe we're all, you know, getting worked up over nothing. You know, maybe Derek and Sharon aren't even interested in sex. [screams] (Bea) Grandma Peg wasn't great at predicting things. -What should we name her? -Bambi. (Bea) Now you know what Bea is short for. Yeah, that's a sweet name. -Hi there, Bambi. -Hi, Bambi. (Bea) My mother named me after her favorite cartoon character and my father had no idea he was increasing my chances of becoming a stripper ten-fold. That's kind of like a metaphor for my whole childhood. But hey, at least we were happy. ♪ If I weren't in the spider web of mine ♪ Oh, here I think grandma wants to hold you. [chuckles] You're such a good baby. Who's a cute baby? [indistinct chatter] I did it! -Good morning, Peg. -Hi, dad. Grandpa is back. ♪ Don't wanna hurt my dear love of my life ♪♪ (Peg) Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! -Okay. -Okay, okay, okay, okay. -Why are you guys so loud? -Sorry, sorry. Sorry. We can't do this all life. You see, I knew something like this was gonna happen. Oh, please. It could happen to anybody. But you remember that time I almost sat on Joy. I'd have squashed her if you hadn't been there. I'm done saving babies from getting squashed! -I'm not raising another kid! -No, you're right. You're not. Derek and Sharon are. -Oh, stop it. -Stop what? Pretending. This is all pretend. And they're playing house. They are not playing house. Oh, Honey, I'm home! Where have you been? -Hi, honey. -Oh, out looking for a job. I mean, we need to get our own place. What? Is that my brief case? What? It's snake skin. Derek, Derek, no one needs to move out. Oh, yes. We do. I mean... [chuckles] A man needs to provide a home for his family. Right, Earl? -Is this your idea? -No. Look, um, tell you what, Derek, if this is what you really want, you know, when the time comes, we'll help you find an apartment nearby you know when Bea is little older. No, it cannot work. There ain't any jobs around here. And, uh, I mean, I want to be closer to mom. So, we're going to Vegas. -No! No one is going anywhere. -Relax. You're not taking Sharon to Vegas. Because you do not know what's best for her. -Yes, I do. -I can get a job at Hooters. -Good idea. -No, you can't. You can't. You cannot take care of Bea by yourself. Yes, I can. Bambi is my baby. She is not yours. I know that, sweetheart. I know, I know. Careful. You know what, we don't need your help anymore or-or anyone else's. I can take care of my own family. [Bea cries] I'm sorry, sweetheart. Why didn't you say something? I told you, I'm not raising another kid. We've been raising Sharon for 21 years. How can you be so selfish? Oh, get off your high horse. You knew, it was gonna end up like this. What? You're the one that said Sharon can date. You're the one who said she can have babies. -I'm the one who tried to stop. -I wanted her to have a-- You wanted her out! I don't have a lot... Oh, my God! How can you say that to me? -Well, listen. -How can you say that to me? Don't make me the bad guy. Because I know you feel relieved too. [sobbing] [piano music] Hello? Are you Loretta Johnson? Oh, Lord, no. Okay, Peg Addleman? McDonald, I went back to my maiden name. -Noted. -And you are? I'm Mary. Bea's social worker. (Bea) What is she doing here? -Oh! -Yes. Why-why does Bea have a social worker? It's routine when minors come in with injuries. I do my report and provide it to the proper authorities. What do they think happened? Well, they think it's likely an accident. What do you think? No, I just want to make sure there's nothing else to it. I actually met Bea before. Seven years ago, after the car accident. (Bea) Ugh, they made such a big deal out of that. That-that was just a big misunderstanding. [chuckles] It's okay. I'm actually more interested in what happened yesterday. Please, have a seat. Um, it's okay that we do it here? I-I don't wanna leave Bea. Everybody else went home to rest and change and... But you stayed. Well, somebody had to. And-and I-I wanted to. My-my ex-husband was supposed to show up and he could've stayed but you know... Surprise, surprise! Ex-husband. I-I don't know how much help I'll be. I was in California yesterday that's where I live. That's okay. Um... Actually, I-I'd like to get a bigger picture of Bea's life. For example... has she been getting along with her parents lately? Oh, Derek and Sharon had nothing to do with this. I'm not saying that, that they do. Just, um... I know, Bea's childhood was somewhat non-traditional. (Bea) Oh, my God, You live in a van with your parents one time and they never let it go. [engine revs] (Bea) I mean, it was a nice van. Dad said the only time he took money from grandpa was to buy it. ♪ Here I go again ♪ ♪ On my own ♪ ♪ Goin' down the only road I've ever known ♪ (Bea) We moved into this really neat community where my parents could just be themselves. Look at this place. -Wow! Yeah. -Huh? (Bea) I think it was the first time my mom had real friends. So, there was always someone to watch me while my parents went to look for jobs. [instrumental music] (Bea) When no one wanted to hire my dad... he made his own opportunity. Say what you want about my parents but when they actually commit to doing something, they do it. ♪ Here I go again ♪ ♪ On my own ♪ ♪ Goin' down the only road I've ever known ♪ ♪ Like a drifter I was born to walk alone ♪ (Bea) Dad said living in that van was the happiest we ever were. But he wanted us to have a real home. And eventually, we moved into one. Huh? [all laughing] (Bea) Dad told me we were happy in the van, but I remember being really happy in the house. ♪ Like a drifter I was born to walk alone ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know what it means ♪♪ [sighs] [exhales] [siren wailing] [exhales] (Bea) I liked that my parents trusted me to take care of myself. Until they started trusting me to do everything. I don't see why this is so hard. I mean, okay. Look, next time when you press the gas-- -What are you doing? -You said, "Press the gas." -I wasn't done! -Don't yell at me! -I'm not yelling! -Yes, you are. I don't wanna do this anymore. You said it would be fun and it's not fun! You gotta learn to drive. I'm ten. What if there's an emergency and I can't drive? What kind of emergency? I don't know. What if my leg fell off? Or I drank too many beers? Why can't mom drive? [sighs] Because your mama can't get a license, that's why. Is that because she's retarded? Who told you that? Esther did. She told everyone at school. Your mama is not retarded. Are you retarded? No! Ain't nobody retarded! [Derek sighs] [sniffles] Look, if you... if you learn to drive... I'll get you anything you want. Anything? [instrumental music] Godzilla, sit. Good boy. Good boy. Okay, now let's tr... -Let's try "Stay." -Bambi! My name is Bea! -Bea! -What? I'm busy. (Derek) Your mom needs help getting dressed for work! Come on! Okay. Thanks. Let's go get mommy ready for work. Where're you going? The track. Bob's picking me up. But it's Saturday. Well, I'm not working. I'm racing. What about my soccer game? Well, I'll come next weekend. (Derek) Bye, Bea. Mom, what are you doing? Have you brushed your teeth? Yeah. Then why aren't you dressed? I'm getting a snack first. No, you're gonna be late and you can't get fired again because dad's truck isn't enough. Godzilla, leave it. [instrumental music] Okay, let's go get dressed. Come on, Mom. I'll walk you to the bus on the way to my game. Godzilla? Godzilla! Mom, did you go outside? Yeah. I wanted to see if it was sunny out. Why didn't you just look out a window? Godzilla! Godzilla! This is definitely an emergency. [Bea panting] [engine revving] [tires screech] [crash] So, you have no idea how this happened? Nope. You weren't driving? Lady, I'm ten. Did your dad tell you to lie? (Bea) He definitely did. No. Can I see my dog now? You can get Godzilla back when we're done. I don't want him back. Really? After you crashed a car trying to find him? I told you. That wasn't me. [sighs] I wanna say goodbye. I can't take care of him and my mom. (Joy) It's natural for a big sister to feel protective of her little sister. And for an aunt to feel protective of her niece. I think I just feel that a little more intensely. Um... So, when Bea was born we wondered if it wouldn't be better for everyone if we took her in. (Ben) Right, right, but then we got pregnant with the twins and, you know, as you can imagine, our hands full. And Sharon was so good with Bea when she was a baby. -She was, surely was. -But... After the... car incident, we revisited the idea and Bea came to stay with us for the summer. [instrumental music] Slice this up for you, buddy. Hey, good work on the avocado toast by the way. -Thanks. -It's good, right? Fruit's fresh today, I love this farmer's market. Alright, here you go. So good. I, I know it's further but I'm gonna go to this one the next time. (Ben) Oh, those blueberries are fantastic. (Joy) These are organic and they're like a, they're beautiful. (Ben) So, like super concentrated super-- What's wrong with you guys? -Bea, why would you ask that? -All the medicine. Oh! Honey, those are vitamins. Would you like some? We don't want you to get sick and there's been some really yucky stuff going around. I'm good. -Mom? -Mm-hmm. Do I have tennis practice today? No. You have tutoring and then therapy. [grunts] Ow! Ow! I cut myself! Oh, alright. Is it bad? Let me see. That's why we do it for you, buddy. -Have to see the damage. -Mama's on it. -How is it? -Oh, it's a good one. -Yeah, is that a real one now? -You're gonna be okay, look. -Your boo-boo buddy. -That felt better? You'll be just fine. What's for dessert? (Ben) We don't do dessert for breakfast. Well, that fucking blows. [slurps] [burps] [giggles] Okay, um, you know what, Bea, I think we gotta talk about some ground rules. Okay? So, we don't use foul language. We cover our mouth when we belch. And in this house, kiddo, we wear pants at the table. I'm letting my boys breathe. Okay. Why don't you guys go out? You guys are done, right? Let's go out and play. (Riley) Yes, yes, yes, yes! Thank you, mom! And be careful on the steps, please. Those steps are too steep. [laughs] She's like a feral dog. -Ben! -What? Y-you know what I found her doing the other day? She was using Oreos to train the boys to fetch the remote for her. [laughs] You guys wanna go swimming? We're not allowed to swim alone. -Yeah. -You're not alone. You're with me. Come on! I know you want to. Please just try to connect with her? I have. I really have. I even gave her my lucky hat. Aww. You've had that hat since college. That's so sweet. It's incredibly sweet. Yeah, you know what she did? She threw it in her bag and then flipped me off when I told her that she couldn't borrow the car (Xander) Bea, are you okay? Bea! Mom, dad, it's Bea. Come quick! -She can't swim. -Bea, I'm coming. -She can't swim. -Hold on! Hey! -Oh, my God. Are you okay? -I got you. I got you. -Are you okay? Oh, my God! -You okay? You okay? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Bea, Bea, that was incredibly dangerous. You understand me? You could've drowned. -Ben? Ben? -What were you thinking? -Huh? -Ben? Uncle Ben, I... -What? -Honey, it's okay. What? [instrumental music] Okay. (Bea) After I almost drowned my uncle did a total 180. It like, broke his brain that I had never been taught how to swim. Or been to Disneyland or had a piece of broccoli. He always convinced that he and my aunt could save me from my sad childhood like they had saved me from that pool. I got ya. [inhales] Okay. I'm gonna call her. [exhales] Bea coming to live with us is the right thing. -Absolutely. Absolutely. -Yeah. It's all about how you present it. I'm sure your sister's gonna understand. Yeah. [inhales] [dial tone ringing] (Bea) Turns out, my mom didn't. She called 9-1-1 and told them someone was trying to steal me. I over heard my aunt tell the cops she just wanted me to have a normal life. For my aunt and uncle, that meant private school. Plank's constant is equal to 6.63 times 10 to the negative 34 joule seconds. (Bea) At first, my dad refused the tuition money. but Grandma Loretta made him accept. She figured if I got knocked up in high school like she did, at least it would be by a rich kid. Bea, I'm still waiting on those college applications. I know, I know, never leave that till tomorrow what you can do today. I'm on it, Mr. V. (Bea) While my family was busy worrying about my future I was just trying to balance work, school and caring for my parents. There I was. You know, I was like in the middle of the road. You know, like, half dead. And, uh, I was, I was looking up at the sun. But, uh, it-it-it wasn't the sun. No. It was the light. -It's true. He saw the light. -Yeah. Yeah. Then when I woke up part of the car was, uh, was on top of me and I just, felt it. I just, you know, I'm muscle. That thing and I-I just threw it off. 'Cause, you know, even since I was a kid I was built like a, you know, brick crap house. [laughing] I don't know what this has to do with my question. Well, you asked me... why I am not scared or-or sad about Bea. That's because... you know, that day... Jesus told me he had my back. And-and my Bea, she's a part of me, so... you know, he's got her back, too. Amen. (Bea) That's me. A real child of God. Good evening and God bless. I'm selling tickets for my school's fund raiser. The winner gets two tickets to see Celine Dion and whoever sells the most raffle tickets gets to go on our senior trip to Disneyland for free. So, it's a win-win really. [sighs] Hi, I'm selling raffle tickets are you interested? -I'm interested in some band. -They're for Celine Dion. And they are five dollars for one raffle ticket. -Maybe we can go together? -No. -No? Hey! I was gonna sell-- -What? There are like a million pedophiles. Thanks. Sorry. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. [sniffles] [knock on door] Are you Bea's doctor? No. I'm from child and family services. I'm trying to figure out what happened to Bea. Do you mind if we talk for a second? So, Bea didn't tell you where she was going? Nope. Feeling nervous. Nope. Guilty? No. Why would I feel guilty? Oh, I heard you tell Bea that you thought it was all your fault. No, I didn't. Okay. I must've misheard. One more question. Does Bea drink? A little bit too much sometimes? I'm not here to get her in trouble but... she had quite a bit of alcohol in her system when she was admitted and-- No, no, no, that's impossible. Bea doesn't drink. Her dad was hit by a drunk driver so she was like, totally against it. So, what do you all do for fun? I don't know. Hang out. Any place in particular? I told you to wear something warmer. Well, this outfit get helps me get all the rich pedos. Can we please just go home? What? No. I have... I barely sold any tickets. So, what? Why do you care so much? Well, I heard Esther Lawrence tell everyone at lunch that no one could sell more tickets than her and I want everyone to know what a lying bitch she is. -And then I want her to die. -Bea! Okay, I don't want her to die. I just want her to get chlamydia. What? It's totally curable. She's probably already had it before. Are you ever gonna get over it? Nia, she called you Kim Jong-un in front of the whole football team. Yeah, thank you. I remember. I was there. Ugh, I'm gonna be late... for work. Ah, pool duty calls. Shall we?

(Ethan) I, ah, I noticed you fell asleep. -You were watching me sleep? -No. I just, ah, I thought, if you wanted, you could borrow my notes from today. (Bea) Oh. Thanks. You might as well be a lesbian. What's that supposed to mean? You just blew off Ethan Rivers. Who is Ethan Rivers? He moved here last week. Everyone's talking about it. His parents own like all the porta potties in Nevada. Oh, well, excuse me for not dropping my panties right here in the cafeteria. They say he had cancer as a kid. Testicular. Heard he only has one ball. Really? One ball? With a smile like that, who needs two? Huh. You think he'll be at Esther's party? You want to go to Esther's party? -So? -I don't think we're invited. Well, you don't need an invitation if you bring alcohol. How are we going to get alcohol? We're gonna get caught. Well, if we do, it's because you're drawing attention to yourself. I'm sorry! I sweat when I'm about to get arrested! We're not gonna get arrested. My mom is way over 21. It's fine. -Hi. -Hi. [instrumental music] -Hi. -Hey. -You wanna see my ID? -No, I'm okay. (Sharon) Okay. -I like candy. -It's good. If this works, we will literally be the most popular people at this party. That will be $29.70. Thank you. Oh, that's enough. -Thank you. -Thank you. (Nia) Your mom is awesome. I mean, your house must be so fun. You get to eat whatever you want, watch whatever you want, go to bed whenever you want. [chuckling] -Thank you. -You're welcome. (Nia) Your mom rocks. [instrumental music] (Bea) Okay! Be cool. What are you guys doing here? I just want you to know, I totally forgot all about the time you called me Kim Jong-il. It was Kim Jong-un. And this is kind of an intimate gathering, so I'm gonna have to ask you guys to leave. Huh, it's fine. We'll leave. But we're taking our beer with us. Yeah. And our hard seltzer. Ugh. Whatever. [inhaling deeply] (Andy) Tanaka's in the house! She pulled up with the drink. Babe, I told you she was cool. Here, let's get this on ice. [indistinct chatter] Ooh. This is my nightmare. Hey, hey, what's your name? Uh, not interested. Wow, that's a very beautiful name. Mine's Ty-- Esther's older brother who creeps around her high school parties because he can't get laid in college. -Yeah. Oh, wow. -Okay. I get laid plenty. -Well... good for you. Okay. -Yeah. -I'm gonna go. -Okay. Yeah. And, just let me know when you get bored with all that high school bullshit. [all cheering] What's going on? Apparently, Ethan told Andy that he has a super strong stream and can literally pee over the top of his Land Rover. So Andy bet him a hundred bucks he couldn't. He's so funny. [Nia chuckles] [all cheering] Whoo! Let's fucking go, dude! -Pay up! -Okay, uh... -Seen enough of that. -Okay. Hey, Bea. Over here. Hey. What's up? So, I have this problem I thought you could help me with. See, I sold a ton of raffle tickets for the fund raiser. Like, there's no way anyone can catch up. And what's the problem? Well, I'm just so blessed that I didn't need the free trip to Disney. So, I thought I could give it to someone less fortunate...like you. [chuckling] -Excuse me. -I made her cry. [laughing] [sighs] [door opens] Oh. You scared me. Something wrong? Um, I think my cancer might have come back. I just started bleeding everywhere and, um... I don't really know what's happening-- Hey, hey, hey. We gotta... We gotta get you to a hospital. Yeah. I'll-I'll drive you. Come on, okay. Come here. What are you doing? I want you to know what it feels like to be a girl. There you go. Come on. Let's go. You know, it's-it's just totally, it's not a big deal. What's not? Only having one-one ball. It is when everyone else has two. Uh... Normally, people have two, yes. Uh, that is true, normally. Um. But-but, who wants to be normal, anyway, right? That's, that's boring. You think it would be boring if I had two testicles? N-no, no, no, um... Uh, my.. Well, yeah. I mean I-I-I don't know. Maybe kind of. It's just my point, my point is that, it is not a big deal. To me. I don't-I don't care. That's-that's all. This is not a big... Don't even worry about it. It's not a big deal. Pretty much. -Really it's not... -Can we not talk? Mr. Rivers? I will give you two some privacy. No, um, please don't. -Wonderful. May I continue? -Ah, yes. Double wonderful. All your tests came back normal. I suggest you follow up with your oncologist, but I have no reason to believe your cancer is back. What about all the blood? Looks like a case of prostatitis. -Is that bad? -It's not ideal.

A guy bet him that he couldn't pee over his car. So he did. (Ethan) How do I stop the bleeding? I suggest you start peeing in toilets, like the rest of us. -I'm an absolute idiot. -No, no. You know I gotta say, you don't seem the "bro" type. But why would you get in a literal pissing contest with Andy Reynolds? Making friends when you're new. I guess I'd rather be the guy who could pee over a car instead of the guy with one ball. Yeah, I get it. You can't tell anybody about all this. -You know that, right? -I won't. I promise. Pinky swear? Pinky swear. [instrumental music] [gasps] Jesus! No. Just Loretta. - Are you the boyfriend? - Uh...yeah. You're hiding something. -No, I'm not. -Please! Loretta knows when a man's lying to her. Ooh, except my second husband. But he was a sociopath, diagnosed and everything. A real Ted Bundy type, but more handsome. Know what I mean? Bea and I broke up. Wait a minute. Are your parents rich? Um... Y-yeah, yeah. In that case, take my advice. Say you're sorry. Whatever you did. Oh... okay. Thank you, Loretta. Ms. Johnson. Can I talk to you? Am I gonna be interrogated now? Oh, no. No, it's not an interrogation. Uh, I'd been there before. It wouldn't be my first. I was framed once, when I was singing at the Nugget. Oh. You sang at the Golden Nugget? The Nevada Nugget in Reno. If it weren't for that Burt Bacharach telling everyone I was passing bad checks... [scoffs] I'd be famous by now.

And I figured you'd be hungry. Oh, well, apology accepted. And I will see you at school tomorrow. I didn't mean to make you feel bad earlier. I don't feel bad. I just, you know, feel different. My life is different than yours. Is that why you never want me to come over? (Bea) Yes. No. No. It's okay. Everyone's embarrassed by their parents. -Hi! -Hi! -Hey. -Come on in, man. I'm Ethan. -I'm Sharon. -Good to meet you guys. -Everyone, say hi. -Sorry, there's a lot of pizzas. The man brought pizza, Bea. And he's very good-looking. -You believe in Jesus, Ethan? -Oh, yeah. This is why I didn't want you to come over. What? What's the matter with talking about Jesus? -Ethan's Jewish, dad. -It's-it's cool. I mean, Jews can talk about Jesus. You know, he was a Jew. So... [chuckles] Jesus was a Jew? Oh. [laughing] Well, I-I guess it's good thing, you know? Grandma Peg ain't going to hell. [laughing] Or me. Would be a shame if you did, son. Hmm. Thank you. (Bea) You're good. There was a little piece. Thanks. I guess they're done. I guess they're done. -I'll help you clean up. -Okay. (Derek) Yeah! -Sorry about all that. -Don't be.

Hey, Ethan, come on. Get over here, man. I wanna-I wanna play one of my originals. -Oh, boy. Mm-hmm. -An original? (Bea) And for the first time since I was ten, I'm not embarrassed about my life.

The Henderson Community Pool is closing in five minutes. You work here? No, Esther, I'm picking up your trash because I don't work here. I really think you should reconsider the free trip to Disney. (Bea) I wasn't really embarrassed about anything anymore. You're right. Because I'm poor. So poor that sometimes I help pay rent for the tiny house I live in with my disabled parents. But you knew that because you told everyone in fifth grade that they were retarded. You may have more money than me, but I have an IQ of one-forty, and the boyfriend you wish you had. And I know that because Gina said that you told everyone you'd let him finger you in front of the whole football team if he asked. She also let it slip that you and Andy haven't had sex since the party. So... -Hi. -How you doin'? -Mmm. shall we? -Sure. -Bye, ladies. -Bye, Esther. -That's obviously not true. -Really? (Bea) Life was good. I made enough money to go to Disney and buy a dress for prom. I was kicking ass at school. Track had never been better. And Ethan and I were getting close. Wait, wait. I'm not losing my virginity in the back of a car like every other woman in my family. -Got it? -Got it. (Bea) Really close. Screw it. [knocking on door] [door opens] Good morning, Bea. I wanted to chat with you about something. I swear that was not me in the parking lot last night. I've-I've never even been in a Land Rover before. What are you talking about? You know what? -I don't wanna know. -Good. I wanted to talk about your feelings toward college. Who said I had any feelings about it? Actions speak louder than words, Bea. What are you doing? (Bea) Looking for the motivational poster you're reading from. Bea, I'm serious. You have really good grades, good SAT scores, and I have to hound you just to get you to finish your application. And now I see, you've only applied to local community colleges. Why limit yourself? Look, I know things at home look a bit different for you than most kids here. Well, then you should know then why my parents can't afford most schools. I-I don't mean to overstep, but perhaps whoever's helping you with tuition now, maybe could help you with college? Ugh. The last thing I need is more charity from my aunt and uncle. I mean, they already keep a photo of me on their mantle next to the starving kid in Africa they sponsor. Really? Um, maybe financial aid is another option. Y-you know, with your grades and extra-curriculars, you have a shot at getting a really good package. Yeah, it's not just about the money. Look, I gotta, I gotta go. I'm gonna be late. Ah, wait-wait-wait. Okay, okay. Wait, just sit, alright? Alright, why don't we just take a step back from reality for a second? If you could go to a school, anywhere in the world, where would you go? [chuckles softly] Honestly, I don't know. I've never really seriously thought about it. (Vasquez) Okay. Um, what's your favorite subject? Mm, I... Science. I like astronomy a lot. That's a great start. I have... Where is it? Here are some great schools with excellent science programs. Tips and tricks. I'd be more than happy to write a letter of recommendation for you. Hmm. These are all really good schools. You think I could actually get in? Shoot for the stars, you'll hit the roof. That's kind of a messed up saying. (Vasquez) Bea, a little more energy and effort and I think you could get into any place. You're an exceptional student. Thanks, Mr. V. I'll think about it. Alright. Hey, exciting stuff. Yeah, well, well. Whatever. I guess. [door opens] [instrumental music] Do you ever wonder what you're gonna do with the rest of your life? [Bea chuckles] No, I've always had too much to worry about right now to worry about the future. Why? I was just thinking... I don't really have like a...goal in life. I mean, i-it was beating cancer, but I already did that. And I thought you wanted to take over for your dad? You think my dream was porta potties? [chuckles] Well, I... You know, I think you can do anything you want. Why? 'Cause my parents are rich and they'll support me no matter what? No. Because you're amazing.

That's hideous. -And two hundred bucks! -Well, how much do you have? Have you heard of a debit card? Carrying cash like that is dangerous. Well, I'm not eighteen yet. My parents would have to co-sign for an account. -So? -Well, so... One summer, I made three hundred bucks selling lemonade and asked my mom to put it into an account for me, she spent it on slots instead. Hmmm. Hmm. -What about this one? -Too slutty. Okay. -This one? -Sluttier. Well, what is wrong with sluttier? Let's slut it up. I like it. (boy #1) Guys, here she comes. Hi. Uh, is there any way you could buy us a six pack? You can keep the change. [bell rings] [sighs] I'm sorry. Are you bored? I didn't say anything. Why are you mad? I'm not mad, but it's like, I haven't seen you in like a month and you said that you didn't want to go to prom, and now you are, and I didn't get a date 'cause you said that we weren't gonna go and now I'm just like...stuck. Uh, I'm sorry. I wasn't planning on it, it just... It just happened. What... what do you want me to do? -Don't go. -Are you serious? Haven't you heard of hos before bros? No. Because that's not a thing. -You're being ridiculous. -Fine, then. I'll leave. -Wait, you can't leave. -Don't tell me what to do. You're always telling me what to do! (Bea) What is that supposed to mean? Why don't you figure it out while you walk home? -Fine, I will! -Fine. And you know what? For the record, I don't think I'm the reason you don't have a date to prom. Wait! I didn't mean it. Come back! Okay... What are you looking at? Oh. (Bea) I didn't think I could feel any worse in that moment. But everything happens for a reason. [dog whimpering] Godzilla? Godzilla! My baby! Hi. Hi. What're you, what're doing here? Hey! Honey, I missed you. (Bea) But at least I could make this right. You're coming with me. My baby! Ah! You're coming with me. (female #1) You did the right thing. I think we're... I think we're good now. Go back to work. [indistinct police radio chatter] Where is my wife? Where is my Sharon? I need you to calm down, sir. Look, she was selling alcohol to minors, and it wasn't the first time. -No, you can't arrest her! -She was selling alcohol. She admitted to it. We're gonna take her in. Look, you don't understand. Look, you-you... Unless you wanna get back there with her. Hey, put you're hand behind your back! Look, she's not gonna be good back there. -You gotta... Okay. Okay! -Calm down. Hey. Look, she can't be there alone, alright. -She won't be. You're goin'... -I gotta go with her. Calm down. Okay, we're home. [chuckles softly] I'm sorry they didn't take care of you. Ugh. You smell like hot trash. Hey, you guys. Look who I found. [phone whirring] Hello? Oh. Okay. What?! What?! How much is bail? [siren wailing] [Derek groaning] (Derek) You know, I mean, jail ain't that bad. The food was decent, right? An-and-and you don't gotta work. [Derek scoffs] Mom, can you turn the TV off? (female #2) I don't normally do this. I really like you... We all need to have a serious talk. You found him! Oh, my good boy! He's back! What a good boy! [both laughing] [indistinct chatter] You are the best little boy. -Don't you dare run away again. -Yeah. He didn't, mom. I gave him away. Well, why would you do that? I, uh... I wanted him to have a real family. I mean, we are a real family. Right. Right. -And you're real parents? -Yeah, we are. Well, real dads don't miss their kid's track meets to race toy cars. And real moms don't steal their kid's money and blow it on slots. And real parents don't need their kids to bail them out of jail! You owe me five $500. That money was for me! I-I don't have five hundred bucks, Bea. Well, then, when do you get paid? Dad? The race track's been kinda slow lately, you know. Wai-wait. Did... did they let you go? When? I don't know. Like, a few months ago. Why didn't you tell me? Because I got a new job already. -Wh-where? -At Lyft. I mean, as soon as I fix my truck. Okay, okay... Between mom's paycheck, and disability we should, we should fine until you get a real job. Your mama ain't getting disability. (Bea) What? Why? Because I cancelled it. Oh! Do you know how long it took me to get mom signed up for that? Why would you do that? Because your mother is not disabled. Oh, that's right. I'm sorry, I forgot. She's special! Yes, she is. We all are. My God! Dad, that isn't a compliment! Do you not know what that word means? Special is just the word people use in this family because they can't admit that you and mom are both retarded! -Ahh! -Oh! (Bea) Grandma Loretta was right. They never should've let you have kids. We'd all be better off if I wasn't alive. [pensive music] [door slams] (Bea) I'm not proud of what I said. But isn't it true? Do I even wanna wake up? What is that? Is that "the" light? Am I dead? Because I was just posing a question. I-I do. I-I want to wake up. Wait, where'd it go? Am I going to hell? Jesus! That's bright. Well, her pupils are reacting. (Bea) Ah! Thank you. I'm alive. I-is that a good thing? Would you all mind taking a step back? -Yeah, give the man some space. -Sorry. As I was saying, her pupils are constricting, which is good. But I'd liked to see quicker reactivity. Sorry, what does that mean? It's common in traumatic brain injuries. She has a traumatic brain injury? Oh, God! She's gonna end up just like her father. -Hey! -Ma... Ma, it's okay. (Bea) Oh, God! I'm gonna end up like my father. Will she? I don't know your medical history, but if she does have a TBI, they range in severity. Some people make a full recovery. And some don't? It depends on the severity. -I'll check back soon. -Thank you, doctor. (Bea) My whole life, I've been torn between wanting to get away from my parents and wanting to care for them. Now, I can't do either. In our follow-up meeting you said you wanted to apply to UCLA. But you never finished your application. -Why? -Because I'm not going. [sighs] What does the poster behind you say? (Bea) "Hang in there, dood!" No, dood. The one that says, "Don't be afraid to fail. Be afraid not to try." I'm not afraid. And I have tried. But I can't... -You can. -No, I mean, I can't leave. Ah... Nevada? I-I don't understand, why? No, my parents, they... they will literally die without me. Look... I... I know your parents are going through some challenges, but from what I understand-- Okay, you-you don't understand anything. [somber music] [door opens] Hey. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Why? 'Cause you're crying. [sighs] Wanna ditch? -My parents aren't home. -Okay. [Bea sighs] [both sighs] Holy shit. Oh, my God, I can't breathe. [both chuckle] -Gonna miss you, weirdo. -Hmm. Hey... I'm still gonna come visit you every weekend. Well, you won't have to. Wait, are you breaking up with me? -Was this break up sex? -No. No. You won't have to visit because I'm not going. You-you didn't get in? I didn't apply. I... I don't understand. Yeah, you wouldn't. I could try. I mean... I know you don't like talking about feelings and shit, but... I wanna understand. While I was off being happy, everything here went to shit. My parents are helpless without me. Really? Did you change your own diapers? No. Your parents took care of baby Bea for a long time without any help from you. So, maybe, because... you do everything for them you've convinced yourself that they're helpless. So... maybe, going to school is actually what's best for everyone. I can't. I have to take care of them. And I could take care of you, too... if you ever need me to. -Well, what do you mean? -I don't know. Like, if you got sick again or something. Um... I'm not gonna get sick again. No, no, I don't... I don't think that you will. I'm just saying that if you did, I would... you know, be here. What kind of fucked up fantasy is that, Bea? Wait. Why are you getting mad? Because it sounds like you want my cancer to come back. I... I didn't say that. I didn't say that. You know, I wake up every morning scared. So scared that sometimes I can't even get out of bed. Because my first thought is, what if I get sick again? So, you're here just secretly hoping I do... Because what? Then people will have another reason to feel bad for you? Because poor Bea. She's the only one with problems. I'm not the only one with problems. You act like it. Do you think I like people pitying me? I think you like that you're smarter than your parents. That way you get to be in charge. And, I think you're scared to go to school because then you won't have anyone to push around. Fuck you! You know, you can use your parents as an excuse not to leave, but you're not going to use me as one. Wha... Where are you going? I fought really hard to have a future. So, it's really messed up when I see someone throwing theirs away. And, I just can't be part of that. What is that supposed to... Are you breaking up with me?

I just don't think she'd want me seeing her like that. [knocks on door] How'd you get in my house? I climbed the rain gutter and snuck in through the window. -Really? -No. -Your mom let me in. -What're you doing here? You weren't answering my calls. It's because I'm not talking to you. Well, you're talking to me now. I'm kinda busy right now, so... Right. Right, um... sorry. [sighs] I came to apologize. -I was being an asshole. -Yes. You were. A stupid asshole. I'm sorry that was so mean. Oh, my God, I was being the asshole. Me. So let me apologize. I'm sorry, Nia. You're my best friend and I shouldn't push you around. Especially when I'm telling you not to let other people push you around. I ju... I... I was so worried we'd never talk again. I almost got an ulcer, and I had to see a specialist. Oh, my God. So... tell me everything. How many times did you and Ethan do it this week? Like... Twenty! What prom dress did you end up picking? Oh, um... Yeah, I'm not going. Was it because I said you look slutty? Because, I meant good slutty? No. I... I think Ethan and I broke up. What?! Why? It's kind of a long story, and I was... hoping I could maybe just talk about it over pancakes if you wanna... I don't know, just like go to IHOP and hang. I'm going to prom. -You are. -Andy and Esther broke up. And then he asked me, but... Screw it. Hos before bros. What? No... I mean, I-I-I know I said I'd stopped telling you what to do, but... You're going to that stupid prom. What if Andy asked me as a joke? What if Esther's in on it and they poured pigs blood all over me and everyone dies in horrific fire? Well, then you better look good burning down that gym. Let's get you ready. Is it, like, too much? Grandma Loretta always says... "Dog is man's best friend. Red lipstick is woman's." -Bea, I'm serious. -Nia, you look beautiful. I feel bad leaving you. Don't. Don't. I've got... tons of, tons of stuff t-to do. I just have to do. (Bea) I wasn't just sad. I was mad... at Ethan, my parents. But, mostly at myself. I let myself buy into the fantasy. And now it was gone.

Where's Ben? Uh... [sighs] He had a pretty good anxiety attack this morning. I think, just the stress of everything. I gave him some of my Xanax, and he passed out in the car. [chuckles softly] I... I... I always felt bad that I was the one born without the disability. Sharon's life hasn't been very easy now. But that hasn't stopped her from enjoying it more than anyone I know. Hmm. -Yeah. -And, Bea... [sighs] Thank goodness. [knock on door] That's a lot of flowers. You can come in. I wasn't sure if you'd want me to. [indistinct chatter] Where's your rest of the family? I sent them home. Grandma Peg hadn't showered in, like, three days. Oh! It's not a record or anything? [chuckles] Sit. I feel like... this is all my fault. Well, you're gonna have to take that up with Nia. Because she feels like it's all her fault. And Uncle Ben and Aunt Joy blame themselves. And Grandma Peg and Grandma Loretta blame each other. So... Okay. Guess I'm off the hook. (Bea) Yeah. How are you feeling? Okay. The doctor said that there's no serious brain injury and I should make a full recovery. (Ethan) I'm so glad you're okay. I put a lot of my shit on you. And that's not okay. Well, you weren't wrong. Yeah, but I got pissed at you for... giving up on your dream when I still don't know what I wanna do. But... I do know... I don't wanna break up. Me either. [knocks on door] (Mary) Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I just, uh, I finished my report. And I wanted to say goodbye and good luck with everything. (Bea) Thank you. Bye. -Hey, Mary. -Yeah? Were we the weirdest family you've ever dealt with? [guitar music] No. Not by a long shot.
