"Do right and fear no one. The Life of Gerda Siepenbrink" by Jutta Brückner was first broadcast on 20 November 1975 on ZDF and screened at the International Forum of Young Cinema in 1978 as part of the Berlinale. In 2016 ARRI Media digitised the film in 2K resolution on behalf of the Deutsche Kinemathek. Only parts of the 16mm camera original negative have been preserved. The missing scenes were taken from the ZDF's master copy. This was funded by the Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media. You want me to tell you my life story? Why would that interest you? When I look back on it all today, I feel like I missed out on all the important things in life. You only realise how to live when it's too late. DO RIGHT AND FEAR NO ONE THE LIFE OF GERDA SIEPENBRINK Georg is always telling me that I spend too much time thinking about the past, and I should appreciate what we have now. And we've achieved a lot. But I often feel down and don't even know why. Why I'm so scared, when we have such a lovely house and no financial worries. But maybe the fear is my mother's nightmare. Because my mother was always scared, as long as I can remember. Since the moment my father fell off a ladder and was taken to hospital. It hit my mother really hard. She went straight to the hospital and sat by his bed for two days. And my brother and the twins were with her too. But I had to stay at home. I was still very young. My father was then laid out in the parlour and all of our relatives came to the funeral. They were all rich farmers. They paid a pittance for all the land that was part of my father's inheritance. They told my mother, "You shouldn't have the land if you can't cultivate it". That's what they thought. My mother used the money she got from the land to buy a first class burial vault for the entire family. It's hard to imagine it today, but she had this idea that she'd bury all of her children and then she would join them. She was so desperate. She didn't know how to go on living alone. She wanted to spare us all the misery. Her family was her sanctuary and she wanted to care for us, protect us and make sure nothing could harm us. The lengths you go to for your children! There she was, left with four children and a pension of 106 marks. The accident and orphan's pension, and then inflation on top of that. That was in... 1922. The lawyers say, "We are sorry for this woman, but the factory relief fund is a voluntary payment. And there is no way to force the factory to pay more than the approved rate. Pastor, we believe this family should be granted poor relief." The pastor and the Presbyterians say, "Women who have served in respectable houses lack much of the crude character and customs so common among the lower classes. This woman is an example of such a case, and we can only ease her suffering. We ask you to reconsider your position as the factory's representative." The director says, "Any act of charity would encourage my workers to neglect the safety precautions just as Mr Siepenbrink did." His wife says, "One of the children gets a free meal once a week and can take some food home for her siblings." "A CLEAN CONSCIENCE... The landlord asks her to leave the flat because she can't afford the rent. But he organises a cheap attic flat in his brother's house with the water supply in the cellar. The baker employs her eldest son to sweep the shop and deliver the bread in return for enough bread to feed all his siblings. The local grocer offers to pay her to clean his shop. To his surprise, she declines, because she doesn't want her children to have a cleaner for a mother. Her neighbour gives her fruit and vegetables from her garden. In return, the girls look after the neighbour's three small children. The other neighbour asks them to embroider her daughter's trousseau in return for her daughter's old clothes. RESPECTABLE MEMBERS OF THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS DO NOT ACCEPT WELFARE No, living off welfare would have been unthinkable for my mother. Back then, people had a very different attitude to welfare. My brother didn't have a confirmation suit and the pastor said he'd get one from the welfare office. But that was out of the question for my mother. She managed to buy him a suit in the end, but I've no idea how. If you got welfare, you were practically a social outcast. She said, "If you've fallen that low, you've given up on yourself." That's why she placed such value on decorum and cleanliness. Us girls only had one good dress, which was washed once a week. On that day, we had to stay at home in patched-up clothes. And we weren't allowed to tell anyone. RESPECTABLE MEMBERS OF THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS HAVE WELL-BRED CHILDREN She took so much pride in her children and their upbringing. She'd been a maid at the home of a rich factory owner. She'd learned about good manners there. This was how she wanted to bring up her children. She wanted to have well-behaved children who didn't get dirty, who were nice and quiet, and polite and very reserved. And helpful and obliging. So she kept us at home a lot. Sometimes I envied the children who played outside, but I had my two dolls and my mother played with me because my sisters were too old. And I wasn't used to the rough tone so many children had, especially those with brothers. Our family was so quiet. Everyone was polite. My mother didn't want us to play with rude children: she didn't associate with people who were in any way unwholesome. Our mother was a fine woman. No, I didn't have any friends. We didn't have birthday parties because there wasn't enough money. I've always been a loner. I have no problem with being on my own. I don't need people around me. People used to be so meticulous. I don't know what other children were allowed to do. We weren't allowed anything. "Pupil Gerda Siepenbrink is clean, tidy, punctual, reliable, but still very childish and playful. She needs to be guided with a sympathetic yet strong hand. "Our homeland is wonderful: the mountains are high, the rivers are clear, the forests are vast, the valleys are deep." Gerda is a diligent girl, with an average but adequate intelligence who fits in everywhere with great ease. "Our teacher has walked with us through our wonderful homeland. We are very grateful." All of Gerda's female traits are well developed. She is adaptable, eager to learn and her diligence and ambition make up for her shortcomings." "Our mother cooks at the stove. Our father is a hard-working man. On Sundays we all go out for a stroll." ... IS A GOOD PILLOW" "Save your pennies for a rainy day." "He who needs not a penny will never have many." "A tree must be bent while it is young". "First work, then play." "Work and virtue are the greatest riches of all." "God's help is never far from those most in need." "No pain, no gain." "Honesty is the best policy." "A tidy house, a tidy mind." "There is no greater wealth than having good health." "An adventure is often a venture too far." "Do right and fear no one." We retreated from the world. We were ashamed of being poor. We saw it as a punishment. So we stayed silent because the others just wanted to snoop on us. We didn't want anyone to know how poor we were because we wanted to be respected. My mother always said, "Keep to yourself, be good and clean if you wish to earn respect and esteem." Yes, I did envy other children because they had a father. They had a lot more freedom than we did. We always had to make sure we pleased everybody. It felt like we were vulnerable. And at home my mother ran a tight ship. Because she didn't want anyone to say, "You can see they don't have a father." The problem wasn't being poor. Other people were too. Sewing appliqués onto cushions in the evening or delivering newspapers in the morning didn't bother me. What bothered me was the feeling we were excluded. You can't imagine what it was like for a woman to lose her husband. All of a sudden, she was an outsider. We were always at the local homeland society's procession. But now, no one invited us. O highly esteemed Germany, the sacred land of the faithful... Hold firm! Hold firm! So we meant the world to our mother and she meant the world to us. On Sundays, we all went for a walk, but we avoided the crowds. And we never stopped off anywhere. How I'd have loved a lemonade! It came in those lovely bottles, which were red or green and only cost 10 pfennigs. But our mother didn't want to spend that. She liked to save her money. Always saving for a rainy day. Even if it was so little. Things got better with my apprenticeship in 1931. I was trained at a large tailor's and handicrafts workshop. It was very hard because there was so much unemployment. I remember the workshop foreman saying, "Well, isn't she small!" My mother replied, "Wait till you see what an eager little thing she is!" And then he said, "Give me a little busy bee over a big lazybones any day". The manageress said, "Contact with elegant and educated customers has a favourable influence. The often ungainly apprentice girls quickly acquire good poise and manners, cultivate their speech and appearance. Their profession broadens their knowledge and furthers their education. This enables them to climb the social ladder. I am thoroughly satisfied with Gerda. She is friendly and accommodating, helpful and courteous and always pleasant to our distinguished clientele. And she has the prudence and ambition necessary to advance in her career." To get to work I had to travel to another town and change trains once. The train left at 7:12 in the morning. I'll never forget that. And I arrived just before 8. Then I'd go and sit on a bench in the third class waiting room. The waiter left me in peace. There were lots of girls from other towns, who were too early to go to their shops or offices. I'd get out my needlework immediately. I couldn't sit idle for a second. We had our lunchbreak from 1 to 3. Since I couldn't go home, I'd go back to the waiting room and sit on the bench. Then I'd get out my lunch pail. Afterwards, I'd get out my needlework again. Then I'd watch the people travelling on the trains. I'd watch the rich masters getting off the trains with their luggage. People still said "masters" back then. I'd watch them heading off to the lakes or mountains. Sometimes anger would well up inside me. I thought, "Why do I have to spend my life in train stations and toil away to earn my living?" In my second year, I started crocheting patterns for the collections for the sales reps to show off at fairs in Berlin or Leipzig. That was money on the side to buy myself a little something. Meat salad or some sausage. But I mostly used the money to buy presents for my mother. Every Saturday, I'd give her a bunch of big, juicy grapes. I used my first bonus to buy her two porcelain figurines: a shepherd and shepherdess. Then I bought her a silver coffee pot with a milk jug and a sugar bowl. On her wedding anniversary, she got a fox stole and a veiled hat. Once I even gave her a shawl, opera glasses and a little handbag. She never used them, but was always looking at them. I still have those things today. At first she told me to save the money, but then she began to like it. And once a week we got pastries. Pralines and Florentine biscuits. She loved them and she'd ration herself: just a small piece each day. She'd always offer me one, but I'd always say no. They were just for my mother. And for Christmas 1932, I gave her a porcelain peacock and a collection of porcelain angels. A lot of people were having a hard time, but we didn't really notice much. My brother was unemployed, but us girls earned a good wage. We were so eager and always went the extra mile, so no one would think of letting us go. We started to buy things: a rug, a nice standard lamp and a nice living room cabinet. We kitted ourselves out with new clothes. We were good at sewing. We got the fabric cheaper because my seamstress sister sold the fabric collections of big mail-order houses to her customers. A lot of people had a hard life and lived off welfare. There was a family in our house who had been so haughty when our father died. And the husband and his three sons were now out of work. And my mother said, "You see? The mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceedingly fine." FREUT EUCH DES LEBENS (ENJOY LIFE) Well, we weren't really political people. But I do remember what they said, "The Führer promises work and bread." So my unemployed brother joined the SA because he thought he'd get work more easily. But after he'd been in the SA for half a year, he realised what it was all about and he left pretty quickly. But apart from that, we had nothing to do with politics. A lot of our neighbours were in the SA and Nazis. My mother was always very careful. If we knew someone was a Nazi, we pretended to be Nazis too, to make sure nothing unpleasant happened to us. We didn't pay any attention to what went on outside. Our main concern was earning our money to have a decent life. When I wasn't working, I was always with my mother. Going out to the theatre, the cinema, bars, going dancing... we did none of that. Not because we had no money, but because a respectable girl stayed by her mother's side for as long as she possibly could. And my mother managed that. She had such a strong willpower. We didn't lack anything. In winter, we always did our needlework. We were always busy. My sisters also read now and then. "Ben Hur" and "Quo Vadis". Reading wasn't my thing. And on Sundays, we went for a stroll with our mother. I never went out with colleagues, so I didn't really have a youth at all. Since we didn't know what it was like, we didn't miss anything. Today I sometimes wonder, "How would things have turned out if we'd been able to live differently?" THE DREAM ONE WOULDN'T DARE TO DREAM I dance with you up to heaven above To the seventh heaven of love... THE DREAM ONE IS ALLOWED TO DREAM The wishes or dreams I had from time to time... I repressed them. I knew I couldn't fulfil them. Because in our family, everything was done together. Being nicely dressed was really important to all of us. It gave you more confidence. My mother said, "You never get a second chance to make a first impression." Every free moment we had, all we did was sew, turning old things into new or using leftover fabric. We never threw away anything. Back then I fulfilled a dream and sewed myself a blue velvet dress, with pearls and embroidery, and very snug-fitting. What a lovely dress that was! I loved that dress so much. I'd have saved it from any fire. I lost it in the war. I was wearing that dress when I met Georg. If you're well-dressed, people see you in a completely different light. Society looks at you differently. BRÜDER, ZUR SONNE, ZUR FREIHEIT (BROTHERS, TO THE SUN, TO FREEDOM) I had my sights set on marrying an office worker. I hadn't given any thought to marriage. My profession made me very happy. But if I ever did marry, it had to be an office worker. A labourer was out of the question. Back then I believed that the man had to be intellectually superior, far superior to the woman. She should be able to look up to him and he should take the intellectual lead. And another reason, of course, was that labourers get their hands dirty. And I saw them as tough and crude and loud and make sleazy innuendos. I couldn't stand men like that. They only needed to tap me on the shoulder and I'd stiffen up. I'd be so cold and dismissive that no one would dare to touch me. I had a real dread and fear of men. I felt they wanted something from me, but I didn't know what. I was scared that they'd behave improperly towards me. And I never thought about marriage. I also did my best to avoid Georg and maybe he only had a chance with me because he was an office worker and spoke French. And he was an accountant and I thought that was a distinguished profession. And I was so proud to be able to go home to my mother and say, "I've met someone who earns a lot of money and you don't need to worry about me. And if I'm doing well, so are you." It took me some time to notice that Georg was so involved in politics. He told me he'd gone underground for a while because he'd handed out pamphlets. And his parents did so much to help the Jews. They took them to the Dutch border. Whenever Georg told me about his friends from the Red Front and the SPD and so on, I'd forget it straight away. I was afraid of anything to do with politics. And I didn't understand any of it either. But I knew I couldn't tell my mother or she'd have said, "You shouldn't marry a man like that." I chose not to see certain things back then. One morning, our shop windows had been shattered to pieces and on my way there I kept stepping over glass and smashed up furniture. Two SA men in front of the shop screamed at us, "You should be ashamed to work for a Jew. Be off with you now!" So we left straight away, of course. We hadn't seen Mr Maier Levi for a while. Rumour had it that he'd gone to England. But we actually didn't give it much thought. We were just happy to have the day off. For the first time on a workday, I went for a walk in Wuppertal. We went to the zoo and then to a tea dance. But I had a bad conscience. Because I knew I couldn't tell my mother. ... that's all I need to feel just fine the weekend and the sunshine. The lark flutters up in the sky and chirps a tune as we walk by, the birds, they sing a song divine, the weekend and the sunshine. No car and no road in sight, we're all alone to our delight. Deep in the woods, you and your guy, the good Lord God turns a blind eye and helps us all to feel just fine, the weekend and the sunshine... We toil so hard for six long days! "But on the seventh day, you shall rest", said the Lord God. But on this day too, we have plenty of work to do. The weekend and the sunshine out in the woods, you are all mine that's all I need to feel just fine, the weekend and the sunshine. The lark flutters up in the sky and chirps a tune as we walk by, the birds, they sing a song divine, the weekend and the sunshine. No car and no road in sight, we're all alone to our delight. Deep in the woods, you and your guy, the good Lord God turns a blind eye and helps us all to feel just fine, the weekend and the sunshine... Now, when would that have been? It was probably before the war broke out, in 1939. Georg took me with him to the Rhine. All of his friends were out of work. They'd get their stamp and go there. They'd set up camp there and spent all day by the river. But I didn't like it. It was such a slovenly lifestyle. They were all really nice people, but... I didn't like that laidback lifestyle. Joseph Schneider tells a joke to see if he can embarrass Gerda Siepenbrink. One day, the pastor's cook says to the pastor. "Pastor, I'd like to get married." The pastor then says, "Why do you want to get married all of a sudden?" "Aren't you happy here? Don't you get everything you need?" "Yes, but I don't get it enough!", she said. I went along with everything and laughed along too, even if I hadn't understood what they meant. But afterwards I said to Georg, "You know... I won't come along next time". A short while later, he picked me up from the train station and he said to me, "There will be a war after all. You know what: let's get married right away, so at least when I'm called up, you'll get a pension." I didn't say yes or no, but was deeply happy. NOW LIFE WOULD BEGIN We got married very quickly and a year later, we moved into a lovely new building. We had a bedroom suite made of elm wood. And a kitchen-diner made of walnut. Beautiful! The flat was my pride and joy. And then a year later, Ursula was born. And Georg and I were over the moon because we both so wanted a girl. GERDA HAS DREAMS FOR HER DAUGHTER And then we were a really happy family. I always wanted just one child. Because I wanted to give my child everything I possibly could. I didn't want her to say later on in life, "I lacked this or that." And above all, I wanted her to have a good profession. I dreamed of her becoming a lecturer one day. She'd have a good income and be independent. She wouldn't need to get married then. When she was one, she could already speak. And we decided she should have piano lessons. And Georg was just itching to go out and buy a piano. He hadn't been called up to serve yet. Then all of a sudden, his uncle died. He'd been an excellent piano player. And we bought his piano and put it in our bedroom. In 1943, Georg was called up after all. He had stomach ulcers, so he was allocated to "homeland duties" and went to Austria, instead of being sent to the front. I could follow him there with Ursula. Georg was head of food supply, so we were well looked after and Ursula didn't suffer during the war. In 1944, he was transferred to Yugoslavia. And we had to go home. As I had a small child, I wasn't conscripted to serve in the war. A lot of women were conscripted. They worked in munitions factories and... and the news service or the "news front", or whatever they called it. Who knows. I didn't pay attention. It didn't concern me. Women help win the war. The anti-tank obstacles will allow the women to work in peace. The men have freed the land from every hostile threat. Joining forces for the final victory! Father's on leave and takes the children to the hospital where their mother works as a nurse. Cheerful music gives you health, energy and the strength to fight, especially when Sister Ruth spends time with her patients. GIVE ME TEN YEARS AND YOU WILL NOT RECOGNISE GERMANY NOW LIFE SHOULD BEGIN In May 1945, Georg was released from captivity. We moved straight back into our flat, which was in an extremely bad state. The doors and the windows were gone. Thank God we could organise a van to bring back some of our furniture, porcelain and linen we'd stored away. A cousin who was a carpenter mended everything for us. My father-in-law got us some wallpaper to barter with. You were lucky if you could do that. The others were badly off. And then things got really bad: we were hungry and freezing. We lived near the port where the freight trains passed by. They deported coal from Germany and often stopped there for the night. And once or twice we went there in the morning and stole some briquettes and coal. Everyone did it. But you can't imagine how scared to death I was. Because the police patrolled the area on horseback. I said to Georg, "I can't do it anymore." Georg couldn't do it either. He wasn't doing well. He had problems with his stomach due to our poor diet. And I was worried about Ursula too. You can't make up for what you lack in those first few years. And we got so little with our food stamps. Your only option was to go to a farm to barter. But I couldn't do that. I'm no good at bargaining. And all I had was my trousseau. But it wasn't worth swapping that for a few eggs and some butter. And then I came up with the idea of opening a workshop in our flat. A lot of men had come back from France with this lovely, soft wool. The soldiers didn't leave a thing in that country. And now the women wanted to use the wool. The business really took off. Sometimes I had up to 20 women knitting garments for me. But I was in charge of it all. And because I'm so terribly precise, it wasn't long before I was overworked. I had bad gallbladder pains and had to shut up shop. We'd planted a garden in the rubble of the house next door and were growing vegetables and potatoes. We had a good harvest. And I had the money from the shop. At least now we could buy expensive items on the black market. Food items like meat, butter, oil, flour. But you had to pay good money for it. The day after the currency reform, the shops were packed with goods. We'd got through the worst. "Now things will start looking up", I thought. "After all, Georg has a good profession and earns enough to give us a good life." NOW LIFE HAD TO BEGIN When the red sun settles down over Capri... Well, things didn't turn out the way I'd imagined. And for a long time, I could only dream of all these things. We weren't well-off at all in the 1950s. You felt there was so much to catch up on. How I longed for a new living room suite. And new beds because the old ones had really suffered in the war. And I'd love to have gone on holiday. Georg was an accountant at a newspaper and didn't earn much money. I often felt very lonely back then. I didn't have anyone to talk to about it. I'd turned 40 by then. And life was still just passing me by. I'd had such a miserable childhood, and then the war. And now the reconstruction. And I still couldn't be a part of it. He was rarely at home. He worked till the paper went to press and often went out with his colleagues. I know it was partly my own fault because I never wanted to join them. I wasn't keen on his colleagues. But I'd wait up for him until the early hours. I'd look down onto the street, thinking maybe he'd come home soon. When it was really bad, I'd get Ursula out of bed and we'd lie there waiting in the dark. What a wise child she was! I didn't have to explain anything to her. She just understood. Georg didn't understand anything. He had his profession, and men always take refuge in that. Georg wasn't the family man I thought he would be. I wished he was more of a homebody. GERDA WANTS TO WORK AS WELL, SO THAT SHE CAN FINALLY START LIVING. Red roses, red lips, red wine... That's why I started working as a shop assistant. But it was a lot of work: a job and looking after the house. I'm very tidy and I didn't want to neglect my household. We bought this and that with the money I earned. And then we got ourselves a second hand car. We drove out of town every Sunday. Ursula had started secondary school and we had to think about financing her studies at university. Georg was happy to have the extra income, but still didn't help around the house. Sunday was the only day when I could get away from it all. And every Sunday we went somewhere new. We'd go and drink coffee and sometimes have a cold platter in the evening. I was quietly planning something... But I couldn't talk to Georg about it, so I kept it to myself. I so longed to have a house. Georg didn't want a house at all. But I badgered him until he agreed to it. And then we joined a building society. We didn't have any equity at all and the houses that I had my eye on were all too expensive. We looked for a long time and only much later we found a terraced housing development, but the building company had gone broke. The houses were in a terrible state and hadn't been completed. It was a long way out of town. But then with a lot of hard work, we managed to do up the house just as we wanted it. Now I had to go to work by train. I got up at 5:30 a.m. to be in the shop by 8:30 a.m. I had to change trains once. A neighbour who worked nearby offered me a lift. But I don't like depending on people. And you never know how to show your gratitude. I didn't get home until 8:30 p.m. and then I had to do all the housework. A house is a lot of work. Sometimes I'd be sitting on the platform waiting for my connection and I'd think about how I'd spent a large part of my life sitting in train stations, in trains and waiting rooms. And then I'd think, "It's your own fault you're miserable." The worst would be over in seven years and then I'd stop working. That's why I kept telling myself: "Just grit your teeth and stick it out." BECAUSE IN 7 YEARS - LIFE WOULD FINALLY BEGIN! TO GEORG. THANK YOU FOR WONDERFUL MOMENTS, ELISABETH I found the photo and inscription in his coat pocket and totally panicked. I just couldn't understand it: you devote your entire life to someone and that's the thanks you get. I ran off. I must have run off. Because suddenly I was sitting in a bar. Then I came to my senses. That's all I have to say about it. It's in the past. That was the final push I needed. I felt so humiliated. But then again, I'd felt inferior my whole life long. I lacked the knowledge others had. KNOWLEDGE SETS YOU FREE. AND IT SPRINGS FROM MANY SOURCES. That was why I applied for the job at the library. And of course I wanted to get revenge on Georg, show him what I was worth. Of course I was incredibly scared at first, thinking I'd fail. Dealing with books and journals I'd never read. All my job involved was putting the used books back in the storeroom. But I was so worried I'd do something wrong, I put aside everything I didn't understand until lunchtime. When the others went to the canteen, I'd have a quick lunch at my desk. And then I'd carry on. It was easier to find things when no one was watching. I hate having things explained to me. The first year was very hard. All the foreign words and scientific terms. But I soon knew my way around the library better than the librarian herself. I nearly always stayed late. I never felt like rushing home. I hadn't forgiven Georg yet. I'm a difficult person. WORK LEADS TO RECOGNITION... Gerda is promoted and helps her boss compile the bibliography for his post-doc. "Sauerland, Hans. The soul of the industrial worker. A cry in the wilderness." Her boss says she can do it during her working hours. But she secretly works on Saturdays. To her joy, she is mentioned in the foreword. ... RECOGNITION LEADS TO POWER ... Gerda is promoted once again. You said to put the books aside. But that was fourteen days ago and now you turn up and have the nerve to demand the books right away. Someone else needed the books. The library isn't just there for you. Now look here! Who works here: you or me? I have the power to decide what should be done. You won't tell me what to do! You have to abide by the regulations. My employer has given me the responsibility and I will thoroughly fulfil my duties. You should learn to know your place. Are you trying to teach me how to run this place? I can decide that all on my own, and I will too. I'm not going to squabble with someone like you. ... POWER LEADS TO KNOWLEDGE ... Gerda discusses Marxism with her boss, Professor Wernicke. They kept us dumb. We didn't know that there were different classes of people. My mother always said, "You are what you own." But it's obvious! Those at the top didn't want us to learn all about the means of production. As the saying goes: "Knowledge leads to power." I've experienced first-hand what it's like to be alienated from one's work. You toil away, but it's meaningless. Professor Wernicke asks, "In economic or psychological terms?" Well... I wonder why people need such huge bungalows and cars. It just makes others envious and envy and gossip are the source of all misery. If the state ordered us... It wouldn't be possible for us. We only have a small house and my husband needs his office. But if our house was bigger and the state came and told us, "Someone else is going to live with you." I'd say, "Of course." It would need converting so that we wouldn't bother each other. And we'd have to make a stair cleaning plan. You have a right to what you've earned. You want to be rewarded for it. But that should be all. If all those claiming to be "masters" got their hands dirty, they'd soon lose their pride and might realise a thing or two. Before leaving, the professor says, "You aren't a Maoist, are you?" ... KNOWLEDGE... No, I won't let anyone order me around anymore. That's why I joined in the protests against the emergency laws. My God I was scared! If I hadn't been there with a colleague I'm sure I would have run off. But I was embarrassed and carried on walking with her. But I wasn't mixed up in the worst of it. We ran into the courtyard of a house when the brawling started. Two young policemen suddenly came in, looking for protesters. They barely dared enter the courtyard. When they saw us old women, they turned to leave right away. But when I saw their truncheons... I didn't recognise myself anymore. I started yelling, "Do men always have to lash out right away? If you were my sons, I'd give you both a good hiding!" My colleague still talks about it today. I used to be scared of the police. Today, I hate the police. They're only interested in punishing and lashing out. Typical men! Men are a strange species. There aren't many men you can have a calm discussion with. They always raise their voices and think they're in the right. If someone gets loud, I go all silent. I'm no good at defending myself. I just clam up. I'm probably just scared. That's why I've never been able to get my way. I've always refused to flutter my eyelids and wiggle my bottom, like other women. I always wanted to be morally upstanding. Morals meant so much to me. When Georg was angry once, he told me I was callous and intolerant. It might even be true. But you can't completely change your ways at 60. And he benefits from it. I can't stop waiting on him and caring for him, even though I work myself. You can't change anymore. You just become unhappy with the way it is. I used to think: in a happy marriage you do everything together. Now I can see you just keep yourself to yourself. GERDA FEELS LIKE SHE'S STILL CHASING HER DREAMS. BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE UP. You have to keep on learning. That's why I read so much, but I don't read novels. I'm not interested in fiction. Or in cinema and theatre. But I like political TV programmes. I like quiz shows. You can really relate to them. I'm only interested in day-to-day politics. You have to keep a sharp eye on them or they'll cheat us. Once a week, I buy all the papers at the central station. Georg doesn't get that. Today, I'm much more political than him. Back then, we only had bans and laws. And now I want to know the reason for this. I don't want the old anymore, but I don't know how to start the new, so I keep repeating the old. One should be more courageous. But if you've been as scared as I have, you can't be courageous. You just get angry. You bottle up the forces inside you, and suddenly they burst out of you, like an explosion. Georg's always accusing me of that. But you need courage if you're going to be brave. You want to be liked too. If you feel abandoned, you can't be brave anymore. Well... If I could live my life over again... I'd do everything differently. I probably wouldn't get married. I'd find myself a little flat. And I have a good profession that makes me happy. And I'd discuss everything with Georg right from the start: who's responsible for what. What we want to buy, if we'll go on holiday. Ah, well... Well, you say these things sometimes. Over the course of life, you lose more than you get... Next year we want to convert the attic into a spare room. Then we'll buy a new bedroom suite. I dream of getting a queen-size bed. BABELFISCH TRANSLATIONS Rebekah Smith
