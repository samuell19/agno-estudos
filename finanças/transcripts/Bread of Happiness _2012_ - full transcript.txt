My first love was Mani. When I was small, I used to go to a nearby library and sit in a chair reading "The Moon and Mani." Young Mani puts the moon in the basket of his bicycle and rides across the sky from east to west. One day, the thin waning moon says "Mani, make the sun go away." "He's too bright and blinds my eyes." "But we'd be in trouble without the sun." "Why?" "Because without the sun, you'll disappear." "Then people will get lost when they walk at night." "What matters is that it shines on you" "and that you shine on others." I liked Mani so much and had looked for my own Mani. But my life became cluttered with things I didn't like. I grew up and started working, and my life got tough. My father, my only family, passed away and it got tougher. My heart was alone and shrank. And I gave up on finding my Mani. When my life in Tokyo became too tough all over Mizushima suggested me to move out and live with him in Tsukiura. BREAD OF HAPPINESS Your mail. Good morning. Good morning. Rie... You look beautiful today, too. Thank you. Hi there. Mr. Abe... This letter's for you. Thanks. Good morning. Hi, Mizushima. Freshly baked pain de champagne. Here you are. Thank you. At Cafe Mani by the lake, you can enjoy Rie's coffee, Mizushima's freshly baked bread, and vegetables of the season. And for visitors from out of town warm beds are ready on the second floor. I have to go. Um... You really are so beautiful. Take care of yourself. Have a good day. See you. Hey! Hey! Wait for me! A little over a year ago when this couple came to Tsukiura to stay, I thought I would watch them for some reason. Mizushima... Yeah? Don't you think a mirror would be nice? For that spot, right? I was thinking so too. - Shall we go? - Yeah. Okay. No good. It's ready. A mirror to hang, right? I made one for you. How did you know? I have good hearing, if nothing else. I think it'll be perfect. Thank you. "Do what you like when you like" Many works by Yoko, who has good ears, are displayed in the cafe. It's perfect. Yes... Nice. Nice. When something good happens, they save a coin in a jar. This way, they build their cafe little by little. Thanks for the coffee and bread. Have a good day. I'm off. Very nice. You've grown so big. Cafe Mani. Do you have a room for 2 nights from tonight? For how many people? One... Sure, we have a room. Can I have your name? "Tsukiura" Hello. Hello. Kaori Saito. I called you earlier. Welcome. This way. Come down for coffee when you're settled in. Thanks. Enjoy your stay. "Romantic Vacation in Okinawa" Hello. We're on the beach. I'm tanning so fast. Our hotel? Moon Beach. Where else? It's great. Thanks. I'll bring back a souvenir. Okay, bye. This feels nice. Mizushima! Tokio! Here. Your bread is always so good. It's been a while. Do you have the day off? I wanted to ride my bike to relieve some stress. A girlfriend? Please! I don't have one! Are you okay? Yes I am. Rie... It's Mr. Hirokawa. Rie! Okay. I brought the logs. I'll be right out! Will you take this to the lady? Me? Um... Rie sent me with a towel. Don't just stare. Give it to me. The towel. Here. Tomato bread. It goes well with wine. Tokio, stay over tonight. Thanks. I can't believe he backed out on me. Our vacation in Okinawa... Sure, I was the one who made the booking. But he said he'd go. He said definitely. Tomorrow's my birthday. I told all the girls at my section. He's popular with women. He's so good at his job, too. I guess some people are just better than others. If I'm here, he's up there. If he's a bread... What would he be? Exquisite French pastry? It's okay though. I'll get over him. Goodbye! Maybe I should stay here for good. Life here has its problems too. Hey... That guy... Who is that guy sitting there? His name is Tokio. Hello. Are you a local? He lives 3 hours away by motorbike. Yeah. Have you always lived there? Always. So your life is quiet and peaceful. Peaceful? Yeah, peaceful. Not like in Tokyo. Do you know how tough it is working in Tokyo? Everyone's so strained. They have to force themselves to smile. But you're there because you like it, right? Not really. I was born and raised there. You wouldn't understand. You should consider yourself lucky. Tokio... Tokio... That jerk... Okinawa is not a place to go alone! This is Hokkaido, the exact opposite! Asshole! Asshole! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning... Here you go. I force myself to smile sometimes too. Plain bread is nice too. Why do I have to go? As a porter. Mr. & Mrs. Hirokawa... Hello. Kaori, our guest. Hello. Hello. If you're staying at the Mizushimas', I'll take good care of you. Thanks. But some things, you'll have to take care of by yourself. Wow! An eggplant? Yes. This too? Tastes good. Try it. Delicious. Kaori might like this better. No... I was just looking. Today's your birthday, right? Yep. This... It's for you. Tokio, right? Yeah. You have time, right? Come with me. What are we doing? I'm supposed to be in Okinawa. I need a tan. You won't find anything. They sell them everywhere. Nothing. No Okinawa products. I told you, didn't I? But they're everywhere. Only in Tokyo. Tokyo has everything. I need to find Okinawa souvenirs. I work in a department store so when I take a weekend off... I have to bring back something to my co-workers. - Uh-oh... - What? We're out of gas. What are you doing? What happened? Up here. What happened? We're fine. Are you guys looking for Okinawa souvenirs? Things from Okinawa... I have good hearing, if nothing else. Anything will do, if it's from Okinawa. How many do you need? You found them? Really? Thank you. What is this? A "koropokkuru." They are fairies that used to live around here. Fairies? They give people what they harvest. They come to our houses at night and leave the crops on the windowsill quietly. Sweet, right? So that doll is supposed to bring you a small happiness. Then why not? A koropokkuru. I want a big happiness. You're so greedy. Happy birthday. Thank you. What's this? It's a Gugelhopf. It's a special bread baked for celebrations. I don't make it often so this turned out funny looking. Thank you so much. Shall we make a toast? Cheers. This lasagna is great. It is, isn't it? Are there zucchini inside? Glad you liked it. The Hirokawas' vegetables are delicious. They are. Thanks. Um... Thank you for doing this. Let's eat the Gugelhopf. Here. Here. Thanks. It's good. It was such a great meal. I'm so full. I bet you thought I was pathetic. I did But... Only the grownups can admit that they are pathetic. So when I saw you you made me laugh. Laugh? You're doing your best to be happy. You have to struggle if you want to be happy. You have to struggle and embarrass yourself... Nothing's wrong with that. I operate a railroad switch every day. You know, to change the direction of the trains. I do it so easily for the trains but it's much harder to change the direction of my own life. The railroads seem to go on forever but I can't leave Hokkaido. I'm not struggling. I can't. You know what? You're struggling right now. Just come to Tokyo. Let's go together. I can't. I don't have a job. You think so? I think so. Really? Really. But the moon looks beautiful to me tonight. Good morning. Good morning. Simple bread is nice too. Yes. The rye breads are nice today. They look good. I'll take them. There are too many. I'm going to share them with my co-workers. A souvenir from Tsukiura. All right. So... Where's Tokio? He left early this morning. He went home. Oh, I see. I'm going now. Thank you for everything. Rie... It was the best birthday I've ever had. There will be better ones in the future. Thank you. Come visit us again. We'll be always here. Okay. See you then. Will you give a message to Tokio? "Thanks for hanging out with me." We'll tell him. Take care. It's beautiful. Although I hate to admit it. Tokio! I'll take you. Really? Hop on. I'll take you to Tokyo. What did you say? I'll take you to Tokyo. Are you serious? I'd really like that, Tokio. You can count on me. 1,000 km to Tokyo... There comes a time for everyone when you realize you're not alone. I bet it was the sunflower. I wonder if Tokio can make it all the way to Tokyo. Sure he can. I did too. We came far, didn't we? Rie... You don't have to force yourself to smile here. There's only one thing I want. What is... that? It's a secret. Autumn has come. Please use these to make chestnut bread. Yes, ma'am. Gently sunny, nicely warm, with a soft breeze... The Mizushimas love to take a walk on a day like this. Hot! A new piece for autumn. Yoko! Do you want some chestnut bread? Autumn is the season of harvest. What? I'll warm some milk. This is Miku. Welcome. Hi there. Here you go. I missed the bus. Coffee, please. Good morning. Mr. Abe, a letter for you. Thank you. Good morning. What? More babies? Twins this time. With a body like this, I didn't realize I was pregnant. 8 croissants, please. Good morning, Mr. Abe. Hi there. What are their names? Suke and Kaku. Like the duo in that samurai drama. You're so silly. Suke! Kaku! I wonder what's in that grip. Should we ask him? No. Hey... Here you go. The bus is here. I'll take the coffee. Bye. We should go too. Suke and Kaku... Let's go. You look really... Come on. Get back to work. Let's go. See you. Miku, I'll drive you to school. I'm delivering some bread. Okay. Here's your bread. Ah, hey. Chestnut bread today. They look delicious. Whole chestnuts? Wow. I think you'll like them. Okay, see you. Bye. Bye. One, two, three. "For dinner" I'm home. I heard you were late to school. I want Mom's pumpkin soup. Excuse me... Do you have pumpkin soup? Oh... Forget it. - Coffee, please. - Sure. You and your wife's place? Yes. Nice. Yes. You're not from here? I'm from Sapporo and Rie is from Tokyo. She followed you this far? She is very young. You are right. Here you are. Thanks. Smells good. You're lucky, being able to drink such good coffee every day. I am, yes. Did you quit your job to open this place? Yes. Big decision. Yes. I wanted to have a life that I wanted. In a place I love with someone I love. Go walking together, eat what we like, bake bread... We want people to feel the seasons as we do, through our bread. The view from here changes every day. It's not just beautiful. This is possible because you're not alone. There are things you can if you are with someone. At times, Rie gets sad for no apparent reason. It makes me and Mizushima sad too. Hello. Come in. Pumpkin soup for you. Miku, it's ready. Here you go. It looks so good. Smells nice. Let's eat. I hope it's good. Yum! Good. I admit you are really good at this soup. I don't want it. I'll never eat it. I'm sorry. I'm going. Miku! Good night. Good night. Please take this to Miku. Could you deliver this, too? To Miku "We are cooking for you." "Please come whenever you're hungry." "Cafe Mani" Welcome, Miku. Hi there. Welcome. Dad. Miku. Good to see you. Come in. Let's eat. Yes, let's. For you. Pumpkin soup... Miku! I'll go check. She'll be all right. It's good. It is. But it's not the same. It's different from Mom's pumpkin soup. Yes, different. Mom... She's not coming back, is she? She's not coming back, right? No, she's not. I'm sorry. I should've told you. Sorry about that. Dad... I wanted to cry with you. For you to share. Thanks. You're always welcome here. Come again, okay? I will. Thank you, really. Dad... There comes a time when you realize you're not alone. For your performance tonight. Apple bread with honey. This is nice. Thank you. Freshly baked. I prefer hot and spicy food. Sure you do. I think I'll have some wine tonight. The harsh winter has arrived in Tsukiura. We can't go outside any more. These guests came in one freezing cold night. "Usu Station" Hello. Cafe Mani. May we stop by for a while? So Mr. Sakamoto, you've been here in Tsukiura before. Yes, when we were young. Did you two come together? Honeymoon? It turned out that way. What do you mean? We were reunited here. She had left me and I was traveling around this area. Then she came after me. On the way home at Usu Station I asked her again to marry me. Oh, I see... "Yuzuki" So we named our daughter with the characters used in "Usu" and "Tsukiura." Her name is Yuzuki. That's a nice name. Maybe I'm talking too much. We're almost there. Are you okay? Winters here are cold. Here. Thank you. Another one. Oh, yes... Hot water. Thank you. Enough? Thank you. I'll make you something hot to eat. Bread... Cheese bread... I'm sorry, she doesn't like bread. You know us old people. I'll cook some rice then. I'll go to the Hirokawas. I'm really sorry about this. I'll pay you for the trouble. It's no problem at all, just give us a little time. Rie, watch them closely. Something's odd. Look after them. Drive carefully. We can't see the moon. No. "Hinode Bath House" "Silver Wedding Anniversary" "Medicine for Aya Sakamoto" Mr. Hirokawa! Good evening. In this weather! Thank you. We always have a lot of rice. It's heavy. Wanna take her too? No, it's fine. Thank you very much. She's a lively one. Tasty too. Very tasty. Shall we go see the moon now? Yuzuki is waiting for us too. Where are you going? Wait. It's too cold outside. Please come back. Mr. Sakamoto! What happened? We want to go see the moon. Wait. You can see it from here. Look. A great view of the moon from this window. It's snowing again. How long have you been married? Almost 50 years. We ran a bath house together. We lost everything in the earthquake. We lost Yuzuki too. But we wanted to provide a hot bath for everyone. So we rebuilt our bath house. It's been a long time since the earthquake. Yes. After the earthquake she looked at the tub that was left then laughed and said, "This is a real open-air bath." You have a good wife. Now it's just the two of us. Enough. We lived enough. That's what we think. Don't you agree? Now I can't do things that I used to be able to. I can't do anything for her. When you're young you can change. You can look forward to becoming a different you. But... Now, everything has become difficult for us. Can't help it. It's ready. Shall we eat? Let's eat. Darling... Potato. Yes, it's a potato. That's bread. You can't eat, right? She cooked us rice. You like it? Yes. This bread with beans... It's so good. I want to eat this bread again tomorrow. Darling, I'm sorry. It's okay... Here. Good. It's good. Please eat bread again tomorrow. Cheese bread is different but good too. Warm enough? Yes, thanks. Good. Bread is nice. Yes, it is. There's this word, "compagnon." I like it a lot. "Compagnon"... What do you think it means? I don't know. A clue. Originally it means "those who share bread." What do you think? Mr. Sakamoto... Why don't you stay here for a while? In a few days, you can see the full moon from here. This is so good. You've got mail. From the earth. I didn't lay these. Will lift your spirits. Here's my braid. You're good. I can't do this. It's okay. I'll bake it anyway. Shape is not important. Cheers. Did you know that the more you make toasts, the happier you will be? That's what they say somewhere in Europe. Make a toast when happy. Cheers. Make a toast when not happy too. If you can end the day by raising a glass with someone that's a happy life. Thanks. There's the moon and there's Mani. There's Mani and there's the moon. I saw the white snow of Tsukiura making a warm blanket around Rie's heart. It's beautiful. Yes, it is. The moon is always here. It'll be in Tsukiura tomorrow too. Yes. Now I have something to take with me from here. Darling... Yes? Thank you. We're going home. Mizushima, I now know the meaning of "compagnon." Those who share bread... It means "family," right? You're close. It means "fellowship." But I think that's the origin of "family." "Usu Station" Please watch over me forever. I will. I'll watch over you too. Thank you, Mizushima. For coming here for me. I asked you to come. Let's go home. "From Fumio Sakamoto" Rie... Mizushima... Thank you for everything in the winter. Aya passed away this spring. When we visited Mani, Aya had little time left for her. I was inclined to kill ourselves in Tsukiura, if we could. But it was an arrogant thought. Watching her enjoying the bread although she hadn't liked it before made me realize for the first time that people keep changing until the very end. Aya lived life fully and died peacefully. I was able to see her through all that. I reopened our bath house I think about Cafe Mani Mizushima's delicious bread and the soup Rie made. What I saw there were you living your lives doing what you believe in. You live a down-to-earth life true to your nature. With "compagnons," all of you together. I think that is real happiness. Mizushima... I found him. What? I found him. I found my Mani. That day, it seems like Mizushima finally seized the one thing he wanted. For Tokio and Kaori. I hope they'll like them. I'm sure they will. I think so too. Today is the 2nd anniversary of their place. Which one's for Miku and her dad? The one on top. It'll be a surprise. Good morning. Good morning. "Bread of Happiness"... Mr. Abe gave a nice name. We're done. For delivery. Oh. There you go. We're having a guest for next year. That's an early booking. From where? From... Here. I still don't know what happiness is. Yes! But I've decided. I'm going to be born at the Mizushimas'.
