Biologically-speaking, it's of primary importance that Man should want to mate. - STUDENTS: [hooting, chattering] - Well, now, we've already come in contact with the age-old saying that Man is polygamous by nature and Woman is monogamous and we know how far from the truth that is. - Come on, Miss Davis. Use words we know. - All right, I'll use some examples. May I have a volunteer to go to the blackboard? Joyce, would you come to the front of the room, please?

No one's always telling you what to do and what not to do. - Sometimes you can miss even that. - Well, I doubt it. I live at home with my parents just at a house not far from here.

If you don't belong, you'll find life at school pretty rough. You won't be invited to any parties and you'll have very few friends. And you'll never have any dates with boys. We'll see to that. You'll find that the Hellcats will be, sort of, a home away from home. Unless, of course, you don't need us. - I guess I do need a club like this. - Who doesn't? - But get this straight. There are certain types of girls we don't want. We don't like eggheads. After you pass your final initiation, there are certain things you've gotta do to keep your membership. And if you have to pass your subjects, to keep from getting in Dutch at home, that's okay. But make sure you don't do it with any more than a "D". We don't like show-offs and we don't like teachers' pets. There's only one teacher I'll let any Hellcat be nice to and that's Miss Davis.

Dating's out, but stealing jewelry's okay. - I didn't steal. - No? What do you call it? - Mike, please don't be angry. - Why shouldn't I be? So it's all right for you to hang around with thieves, but not to go out with me. - I didn't really steal that stuff, Mike, I... I just let Connie think that I did. - Oh, sure. - Those earrings cost $1.98 and, well, I slipped them in my purse when the man wasn't looking and then I left $2.00 on the counter. Now that isn't really stealing. I know how you feel about that gang, Mike, and you're probably right, but... but I have to belong. - Why? - Well... It's a long story, Mike, and you wouldn't understand. - Look, I've been watching that club operate for over a year now. It's not for you, Joyce. I mean it. - But, Mike, I can't just quit now. - Yes, you can. It's easy. Just say, "I quit" and walk out. - But, for someone like you, it's easy. - What do you mean someone like me? - I don't know, but... well, you just seem so secure and-- - Secure? Well, what's secure about me? Look, I like in a furnished room and hope, from day to day, the coffee shop stays open. You have a home and parents. - I didn't mean that kind of security, Mike. And, besides, for all the attention I get at home, I may just as well be renting a furnished room there, myself. - Oh, I've heard that complaint before. - It's the truth, Mike. That's why I joined. I guess that's why most of the other girls joined. Connie calls it a "home away from home." I said it kind of kiddingly one day, but I think that's what everyone really wants it to be. You know, if we had the right kind of home, we wouldn't have to go out and look for another one. If our parents showed some real interest in us, instead of just-- I'm sorry, Mike. Let's not even talk about it. It's so nice and peaceful here. - Can you see why I want you to keep out of trouble? - No. Why? - Because I don't want my girl messing around with those creeps. - Oh, am I your girl? - What do you think? - CONNIE: Hey, Joyce? - Yes? - Come here. I've got an idea. See those kids standing up against the tree? - Yeah. - I've decided on your final initiation. The boy's name is Rip and the girl's name is Terry. She's Rip's girl. Now I want you to go up and ask Rip to be your date at a dance next Saturday night. - Now? - Uh-huh, right now. - But, Connie, I don't even know him. - Well, introduce yourself. - Excuse me? - Well, hello? - Hello. - What do you want? - I came over here to talk to him, not you. - What can I do for you, kid? - I'm a member of the Hellcats and I'd like to invite you to a party Saturday night as my date. - He's busy Saturday night, baby. - You got a date, kid. What's your name? - Hey, wait a minute! - Shut up. What's your name? - Joyce Martin. - Where do I pick you up? - Well, you know Connie, don't you? - Yeah. - Well, check with her. I've gotta go now.

Now I'm just people! - Oh, no, no, I didn't mean exactly you. - Then who did you mean? - All right. All right, then, I did mean you. - Good, I get your message. While you're being honest, who are you really going to the party with? - Mike, you're beginning to sound exactly like my father, and I've had just about all I can take of you for one day.

Besides, I want her with us. - Oh, Roger, for Heaven's sake! When are you gonna let her grow up? - I don't want to discuss it any further. She's coming with us or we don't go. - My, you look pretty. - Thank you, mother. - Joyce, you've got on too much lipstick. - No more than usual, dad. - Well, it's too much for a girl your age. I don't understand why you kids always try to act grown up. By the way, where are you going? - To a party. - Why haven't you said something about it before this? - Mainly because I hardly ever see you. And when I do, you don't have any time to talk. - She told me, dear. - Are you going with a boy? - No. With a man. - Now, see what I mean? - Don't look at me. You've created the problem.

[sobbing] - Honey, take it easy. Come on. - [sniffles] - You shouldn't have let her go. - Why not? - Because she's never been allowed out this late and you know it. I didn't slave so hard to bring her up right that she can go running off to wild parties. I won't stand for it. - Who says it's a wild party? - I know these kids. - Roger, try to control yourself.

Oh, you know that I wouldn't deliberately make you and mother worry. I don't know anything any more, except you're absolutely and completely out of control! - Out of control? What do you mean? Coming home late one night isn't out of control. - She's right, Roger. - From now on, young lady, you're on a strict schedule. Homework after dinner. In bed at 10:00. And on weekends, you have to be in at 12:00. We have to know where you're going and with whom! - No. - No? And what does that mean? - It means that children have rights as well as responsibilities! - Well, how do you like that? She's telling us about rights and responsibilities. Whatever happened to the respect that children used to show their parents? - Well, maybe they have to receive it in order to show it. - Oh, you, too? - I'm sorry, dear. But I do think you're being a little unfair. - Well, what do you expect me to do-- welcome her with open arms and thank her for keeping us up all night? - She's an individual and we tend to forget that. And it must hurt her to think that we don't trust her. - Since when have you become so psychological? - What's the difference? It's certainly about time we both tried to understand her. - You're right. I don't know why I fly off the handle like that. I don't mean to. - Come along, dear. Go to bed. We'll straighten it all out tomorrow. - It's been a day and a half since Connie disappeared. The cops are bound to show up any time now, so keep quiet about Saturday night. We haven't seen her since Friday afternoon, got it? - But we'll get in worse trouble lying about it. - You do what I tell you! Connie and I organized the Hellcats. And now I'm taking over. You wanna know what I think? I think what happened to Connie wasn't an accident. She was pushed. I'm going to find out who did it. And when I do... Okay, break it up. - What do you think about that? - She scares me. - Me, too. Do you wanna know something? I don't think she's got all her marbles.

She hasn't been seen since. She was dressed up when she left home, so she may have gone to a party. I'd like you to tell me who her friends are so if there was a party, they may know about it. - Well, Connie belongs to a club called "The Hellcats." - Hellcats, huh? - Mm. - Do you know who the other members are? - Yes, most of them are in my class. - Well, I'd like you to send them in so I can talk to them. - Certainly. - One at a time, please.

When she didn't come to the school today, I thought she was sick. - Do you know anything about a party Saturday night? - A party? - Yes, a party. - No, sir. - You girls belong to some sort of club, don't you? - Yes, sir, it's a... a sort of a social thing. - But this party that Connie went to Saturday night, wasn't that one of your club socials? - No, sir, or we all would have been invited. - Yes, of course. All right, that'll be all, thank you. Have Miss Davis send in another girl, please. - MEG: He'd like to see another girl. - Then you haven't known Connie very long. - No, sir. We just moved here. - Do you know if she has a boyfriend? - No, sir. - Do you know anything about a party Saturday night? - What party? - Her mother thinks she may have gone to one. - Oh. - Well, do you? - Oh, no, sir. - All right, Joyce, that'll be all. Oh, by the way, Joyce, uh... do you know if Connie has a particularly close girlfriend, someone she's a little more familiar with than the others? - Well, she and Dolly seem to be together a lot. - Would you have Miss Davis send Dolly in next, please? - Yes, sir. - And thank you for your help. - He said he'd like to speak to Dolly next. - MISS DAVIS: All right, Dolly. - What was he asking? - No discussion, please. The period's almost over and we couldn't get all of our work finished, so I'll cancel homework for tomorrow. Please re-read the chapters meant for today. - Well, come in. I'm Lieutenant Manners, Police Department. Sit down. Go ahead, sit down. One of your classmates has disappeared. I'd like to ask you a few questions. - Why me? - She's a friend of yours-- Connie Harris. I understand she's your best friend. - That's right. - Well, you don't seem surprised at her disappearance. - Well, who said she disappeared? - She hasn't been home since Saturday night. What do you know about a party Saturday night? - Nothing. - Are you sure? - Connie and I are friends. If she was going to a party, she would have told me. We go everywhere together. - When did you see her last? - Friday afternoon. - You didn't make any plans for the weekend? - No. Well, she said her mother was buggin' her about staying around the house or something. - Does Connie have any enemies? - No, we all liked Connie. She was a regular guy. - What do you mean "was"? - What? - You used the past tense. Why did you say "was"? - I didn't know that I did. Look here, quit choppin' at me! I don't know anything and I didn't do anything! Leave me alone! - Okay, Dolly, you can go for now. You've been a big help. Send Miss Davis in, please. Joyce Martin seems like a nice kid. Tells the same story as the others. Dolly Crane--nervous, upset, used the past tense in referring to Connie. They all tell the same story. I can't make up my mind whether it's the truth or a well-organized lie. Tell me, Miss Davis, how do you stack up with these kids? - They trust me. - How do you rate it? - Well, I guess it's because I try to be fair to them. - Do you feel that if anything was bothering one of these girls, she'd come to you with it? - I don't know. It's happened before. - Well, I have a feeling it may happen again. Would you let me know if you hear of anything that may be important? - Look, I can't believe that any of these girls has anything to do with Connie's disappearance. Basically, they're all nice kids, so-- Oh, of course, I'll help any way I can. - Fine. Here's my card. And thank you very much. - [door closes] - Oh, it was a swell evening, Mike. - Did you like the play? - Oh, yes. Oh, and your friends are so nice. - I'm glad you liked them because I want you to see more of them. - Okay. - I, uh, hear there was some excitement at school this week. You didn't tell me the police were around. - Oh, I forgot. - Did they question you? - About what? - About Connie? - Why should they question me? - Didn't you go to that party with her last Saturday? - No, I didn't. - Oh, you told me that you-- - I was supposed to meet her there. But she didn't show. - Oh. - MALE RADIO ANNOUNCER: We interrupt this program to bring you an important news bulletin. Police report the body of Constance Harris, missing high school student, has been found. Mr. and Mrs. Edward Lewis, returning home from a vacation, found the girl at the foot of their basement stairs. Police say that she had been dead for about a week, and the death probably resulted from a fall. They have not been able to determine what she was doing in the house, which has been locked for the past month. - [clicks off radio] I know how you feel about Connie, but...but, still... - Whatever happened, she asked for it. - How can you say that, Mike? It was an accident. - It was no accident she was inside that locked house. Those wild kids usually get just what they deserve. Oh, I didn't mean you, honey. - Yeah, I know, Mike. I'm...I'm awful tired. I'm going in. - Oh, I'm...I'm sorry I sounded off about those kids at school, but that's the way I feel. - Yeah, I know, Mike. It's just the news of Connie. It upset me. - I understand, kid. - Mike, I'm going to quit the Hellcats. - Good. And I'm glad you're not involved in this mess. I'll see you tomorrow. [starts car engine] - Cream and sugar? - Just cream, please. - Well, Joyce, what is it? - What do you mean? - [laughs] Look, I like social visits from my students. I've been encouraging it right along. But you must admit that this is an odd hour to come calling. - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was so late. I felt like talking to somebody and I just found myself here. - Well, I'm glad you did. Do your parents know where you are? - No. - Well, we'd better call them so they won't worry. What's your number? - CITRUS-1214. - [dialing telephone] Hello, Mrs. Martin? Well, this is Trudy Davis. I'm one of Joyce's teachers. Oh, no, no, nothing's wrong. She's here visiting me and she wanted me to call so you wouldn't worry. Oh, yes, that's a good idea. I'd like to meet you, too. Oh, look, how about lunch on Saturday? Oh, well, perhaps the next week? Oh, well, thank you. I feel that's part of my job. Oh, no, no, I'll send her home in a taxi. Goodbye, Mrs. Martin. - Bet she has a bridge game on Saturday. - Well, she didn't go into details. Joyce... did you listen to the radio tonight? - Huh? - Connie was found. - Oh? Where? - Her body was found. In a locked house up in the hills. Do you happen to know how she got there? - I'd better be going. It's awful late. - What's the matter, Joyce? Why are you running away? - Oh, I'm not running away. It's awful late and-- - Did your coming here have anything to do with Connie? - Oh, no, no. - Then why don't you tell me why you came? It is about Connie, isn't it? Was there a party that night? - Oh, Miss Davis, please don't ask me any questions. - I only wanna help you, Joyce. - Oh, Miss Davis... Thank you for the coffee. I've gotta go. - Well, now, Joyce, wait a minute. Let me call a taxi. - Hi. - Oh, you're early. So are you. What are you doing at my desk? - Just leaving a note. Here. - Oh? [reading] "Emergency meeting tonight. 8:30." "Don't discuss it."? What's it about? - About what was found last night. - Oh? - I tried to call you. You weren't home. - I had a date. - With who? The cops?! - Why don't you quit being so smart, Dolly. - Oh, no, I've gotta keep on being smart--real smart. - Dolly? I wanna quit the Hellcats. - Oh? We'll talk about it tonight. - I don't wanna talk about it. Can't I just quit right now? - No, there are certain things that have to be settled, first. You be there. - Still insist on going? - This is the last time, Mike. I told Dolly I'm quitting and now I have to do it at a meeting. - Everything nice and formal. - Mike, don't be mad. - Okay, as long as you don't drag it out. - No more than ten minutes, I promise. - Where is this place anyway? - Just a few more blocks. I'll tell you when to turn. - [knock at door] - Well, come in. - Hi, Miss Davis. - Hello, Miss Davis. - Come on in, girls. I'm getting very popular all of a sudden. Sit down. - Oh, no, thanks. We don't have much time. - Miss Davis, we think Joyce is in trouble. - What kind of trouble? Where is she? - Well, I found a note in Joyce's history book. Dolly told her to come to a meeting of the Hellcats tonight at 8:30. Only she didn't tell any of the rest of us. - And that means that Joyce and Dolly are there alone. - Alone? Where? - We meet at a deserted movie house on the other side of town. - Why do you think Joyce is in trouble? Come on, girls, you've told me this much. You might as well tell me the rest of it. All this has something to do with Connie, hasn't it? - Yes. You see, we all went to a party that night. Joyce, too. - But it was an accident. Connie fell. Later Dolly told us that she thought that someone pushed her and that she'd take care of whoever did it. We think she's blaming Joyce. - Dolly's been acting sort of funny lately. - Why didn't you tell this to the police? - Oh, we were scared. Dolly said they wouldn't believe us. She made us swear to keep quiet. - I'm afraid that was a mistake. [dialing telephone] Extension 429, please. - [telephone buzzes] - Lieutenant Manners. - Lieutenant, this is Trudy Davis. On the Connie Harris case, you asked me to call. I'm afraid there may be trouble. There's a deserted movie house at...? - Fourth and Jordan. - Yes, I know the place. - Well, do you remember the girl Dolly? She's gotten Joyce Martin down there on some kind of a pretext. - You're right, it does sound like trouble. You'd better meet me down at the theater. - Thanks. - Oh, when you get to the next corner, turn right. - Okay. - I'll be out soon. Don't worry. - Ten minutes and I'm coming in to get you. - ♪ ♪ - [door creaks] - ♪ - Come on in. You're just in time. - Hey. Hey, where is everyone? - This meeting is just for the two of us. [laughing] [laughing] [laughing] - Dolly, please, what is all this? What are you doing? - I'll tell you. I thought it was very funny that day when you went in to see the cop and came back and said he wanted to speak to me. How did he know my name? He didn't ask for any of the other girls by name, did he? - I only told him that you were her best friend. That's the truth, isn't it? - Sure, but what about the other night when you had a date, and the police found Connie's body the same night? - Dolly, please, I didn't have anything to do with the police. Why should I? - Because you pushed Connie and want everyone to think I did, that's why. - You're crazy. - Don't say that! Don't ever say that. - [gasps] - [laughing] - [police siren wailing] - [pounding on door] - ♪ - I didn't push her. Honest, I didn't. - I know you didn't. But you know who did. So I gotta shut you up. - No, no, I don't know. - Don't play innocent with me. I pushed Connie and you know it. We had great plans, Connie and me. But she made me her flunky. When you came around, I saw that she liked you better than me. - No, no, that's not true. - Oh, yes, it is. But I fixed her. And now I'm going to fix you. [switchblade clicks] - JOYCE: [screams] - DOLLY: [screams] - [loud thud] - Joyce, are you okay? - [weak voice] Yes. Yes, I'm okay. - You'd better wait outside. - Oh, Mike. - It's all right, honey. It's all over now. - Oh, Mike, it was horrible. She said that I knew that she killed Connie. And she was gonna kill me! - Come on, the police are downstairs. You can tell them. We're coming down, Lieutenant. - Dolly told me that she killed Connie and then she-- - Yes, well, you'd better go home and get some rest now. You'll have to come down to headquarters tomorrow and make a statement. - She won't be in any trouble, will she? - I don't think so. But she could have saved all this, if she'd told us about that party. - [sobbing] - I'd better get her home. [starts car engine] - Hello, this is Miss Davis. Remember? Yes, that's right. I want you to listen closely. Joyce is on her way home and I want you to know what happened tonight. - Yes, I understand, Miss Davis. Just a moment, please. Roger? Pick up the extension in the den. All right, Miss Davis, please go on. The police? Yes? Oh, no. You're sure Joyce is all right? She wasn't hurt? Oh... What a terrible thing. Yes, of course. We understand. If only we'd known what was troubling her all this time. - The boy bringing her home is Mike Landers. He's a nice boy and they like each other. I think he can help her a lot. Yes, yes, I'm sure you will. And, Mrs. Martin, we will get together soon. - Yes, we must. Any time you say. - Oh, fine. Yes. Yes, goodnight. Goodnight, Mrs. Martin. - ♪ ♪ ♪
