Doctor... will you believe me? Tell me, I will A time is following me Time? Interesting! Go ahead I am tortured, scared, it talks to me... and even calls me out to play doctor Calls you out to play? Then? I get paralyzed at that time! But I can see and hear everything around, at that very exact time! Cool... cool... It is called 'Sleep paralysis' It has no connections with th time you're mentioning I don’t know how to explain this better, doctor Ok, keep that aside. Let me ask you this Do you have any personal connect with that 'time' ? Doctor, he was born at 3:33 Is it? That's the reason I don't get it Really? Normally, we are all connected to some numbers Every person has an attachment with some number For example, I like the number 5... because that's my birth date In a clutter of numbers, that always stands out Its the same with you. See, whenever you see the time.. Especially... yes, 3:33 that gets your attention as it is your birth time That is all What's the remedy doctor? Its simple. He just needs to get it out of his head Should not dwell in it, understand? Ok? I will prescribe you some medicine for a week. It'll help you sleep well In the next session, we shall review you further Don't worry Kathir, you will be alright, lets go. You'll be fine What is this ? Nothing. Lets go Will you tell me or not? My dad wants me married to his friend's son I tried explaining but they won't understand So, I called up that guy and told him about us And this happened I can't handle my parents for long. Please do something, Kathir Please When I say, all the evil spirits target young boys and girls... nobody believes it A doctor gives a medical term & prescription, you follow Spit! Uncle, why is grandma... Nivya, go sleep with your mom Good night, uncle Good night, honey Kathir, have you taken your pills?

You leave Kathir..! I don't know if you understand what I am telling you... you will be in trouble, if you are with me Come on, Kathir... Get lost ! (Phone rings) Hello sir! You are a renowned paranormal investigator in India You've solved a lot of international cases as well Can I ask you a personal question? Yeah. Sure What got you interested in learning about 'spirits' I love my dad a lot Unfortunately he died in an accident I was around 15 or 16 years old At that age... Especially at that age... I could not digest it I was longing for his love Later, my friends... they told me about some people... who could connect me to my dads spirit So, that got me searching for such people I didn't find anyone who did it professionally So then... I studied a lot of case details and did a lot of research As a result, I'm here today Your dad is the reason you got into this profession ? May be How do you identify negative vibes in a house? Do you smoke? No Good A lighter is good enough to figure that How is it possible with a lighter? Go to the middle of an enclosed room Light up the lighter If the flame is still, its clear If the flame is wavy, even slightly... then there's a negative vibe for sure! Sounds really interesting You have done lot of researches on spirits... which was most challenging case for you ? There's one Can you elaborate? 3:33 3:33 ? What is that ? Would you believe, a time can actually torture you to death? Come on, sir. How is that possible? His name is Oven In 1935 he died under mysterious circumstances in USA 16 years ago, I dug deep into this case to write an article It was quite strange because... he checked into a hotel and.. insisted on staying in room #333 on the 3rd floor They gave him the room He didn't step out for two days On the third day, the management got suspicious... and broke into the room They found him dead He was tortured and butchered into pieces Nobody entered that room in those three days he stayed... neither did he step out. He was alone I connected with his spirit to find out the murderer I found out that he died because ot the time 3:33 Thousands have died because of this time I have gathered lot of information about this time How can time possibly kill someone? It is difficult to believe but that's the truth It's a.. half-evil number that number is killing all those born at that time Recently, a bride had jumped to death at her wedding It happened at that time Why is the number killing those born at that? Because only they can destroy that number Sir, I don’t get it Actually, what is this 3:33 ? If you figure out 3... you'll understand about 33 automatically In the 9th century... our ancestors considered numbers as God The numbers were actually shapes I'll show you This is the numeric chart of that century Look at number 3 it resembles hindu symbol 'OM' and people prayed to this number as a form of God To make this number as powerful as the God... sages and saints made long penances and prayers and made the number very powerful 3 has a lot of relevance in our lives In our past,present and future... 3 has an inevitable relevance in every persons life Look at this Jesus was crucified at 3:33 PM, on 3rd April, in 33rd century and its on records The most revered number 786 in Islam, numerically totals to 3 Hindu god shiva, is 3 eyed Every ritual is based on number 3, in temples Our earth is the 3rd planet So this number 3 was used for all auspicious events When there is 'good', there has to be 'evil' Some Egyptian witches, learnt about this number... and tried their best to take over it... but in vain To avenge, they wanted to create a much more powerful number So they created 33 and infused it with all their negative energy... and created havoc with that power However, this negative energy was created artificially So it cannot last long That number lost its power gradually The witches, saw their loss of power... and in order to ensure that negative energy doesn't wear out... they wanted to merge their number 33... with number 3, to regain the lost power One day, the witches with their black magic power... made evil sacrifices to gain positive number on their side And 333 witches gave their lives in human sacrifice All those 333 evil spirits, created enough power to get... the positive number 3 into their evil number 33 I'm scared of that time now Is it an exaggeration? No, its the truth Even today, black magic is done at 3:33 So, people born at 3:33 cannot be saved? They can be They can save themselves How? By entering at that time themselves... The key to escape lies within that time That time... precisely one minute which is 60 seconds Within that 60 seconds they have to find the key and escape from it Then they'd have escaped from that time It is not as easy as it sounds That time will go to any extent to divert their focus Despite that, they must hold their focus on the key What if they don’t figure out that key within 60 seconds ? If they are unable to get the key.... If they are unable to get the key.... If they are unable to get the key.... Why haven't you turned on the lights ? Did you eat?? Nivya, keep the bag upstairs and change Ok ,mom That was too much travelling. My hip hurts I'm exhausted Kathir, Priest has advised a consultation We must go there tomorrow Keep yourself free. Ok? Ok Why are you so dull? Are you unwell? Nothing of that sort Let me know if something is troubling you Mom! Stop pestering him You keep quiet What is it? Mom, you go and sleep -Mom, let's go and sleep -He looks weak Just come, mom (Dog howling sound ) Kathir, come quick! Mom, what happened? Kathir, we are locked in here with someone! Mom! We are scared! Nivya is scared! 0pen the door, mom! Whats going on? -Open the door. -Uncle, I am scared Nivya, don't be scared. I will open this door somehow (Commotion) "I Love you...... my hubby I love you......" "I Love you...... my sweet heart I love you......" Kathir... What are you doing there? Come upstairs Brindha? Hey Kathir, why is your phone turned off? Your mother and sister met with an accident What? They are upstairs They met with accident on their way back from temple Trust me! Hurry up, they are all in serious condition Kid is in a critical stage, hurry up Uncle... Mom's is calling you, come upstairs Kathir, don't believe her. I think she's a ghost They are all in a critical stage... Nivya's struggling there Come on, Kathir! Come! Hey Sarath, don't! Stop it! Sarath! Sarath! Get up! Buddy... Is he dead? (Giggling) One minute, that is 60 seconds Within that 60 seconds they have to find the key and escape from it Then they'd have escaped from that time It is not as easy as it sounds That time will go to any extent to divert their focus Despite that, they must hold their focus on the key Kathir, why is the power outage so regular here? Go to the EB office tomorrow and fix this issue Where did you go at this hour? What happened, dear? Hands off me! What are you doing? Don't you know her? Listen, stay away ! What happened to you? Stay away ! i'm warning you ! Don't say such things Do you even realise what you are doing ? I'm warning you again and again! Won't you listen? Oh no! Oh no! Devi... Devi! Devi! Oh no!
