A Wakamatsu Productions Film Shinjuku March, 1969 Hi, Spook. Know anyone who'd pass as a high schooler, Megumi? An actress? That's not necessary if she's pretty. When for? We shoot in 10 days. A Pink porn? Yes. The director? You know Masao Adachi? Wakamatsu will be shooting his film too. But we need a girl. Listen. Do Pink movies ever have women assistant directors? Wakamatsu Productions. An independent film production house founded by Wakamatsu in 1965. Their films were sexy, violent and socially relevant. The compulsion for life, sex and death enthralled younger audiences. Crush the Security Treaty! Free Okinawa! Victory ours! Hi Hey. I don't know. What? What's your theme? You know the WW2 guerillas left on islands? They're no guerillas. They kill and steal from farmers. They're just trouble. But you have high schoolers! The high schoolers rebel after the failed siege at Tokyo University. The teenagers don't know failure yet. And they also end up failing. Hey. You an actress or mistress? She wants to be an AD. You can but even men don't last. Is it the job or do you want to work for Wakamatsu? That's Adachi, Okishima and Komizu. Call me Gaira. She's Megumi. - Megumi. - It's Megumi Yoshizumi. Hey, guys. Hello. You sloths hang around doing nothing all day! It's a meeting! I bet you just play Hanafuda cards and jack off. Found a girl? I don't want porn actresses. She'll find you a girl. That's Megumi Yoshizumi. She wants to be an AD. Another one of your hippie friends from Shinjuku? A female assistant, director... Seen any Wakamatsu films? Which one? The Embryo Hunts In Secret. Oh, really? We shot that in one long session. We went crazy. Mr. Wakamatsu was swinging a prop ax. It records our insanity. A movie can... Uh, yes? I was impressed by how daring it was. Nozomi, listen. Do you drink? It's Megumi. Yes! Good. No one here is on a salary. You get paid per assignment. So we can't drink from his stash. If you last 3 years I'll let you direct a movie. I'll do my best. You better save it! See you tomorrow. We, the student council, have concluded from our talks that we aren't satisfied with the school and the PTA. We reached the same decision as you... Bang! And cut! OK, good! You can deliver lines, Megumi! April, 1969 Shooting Female Student Guerrilla You can deliver the lines, Megumi! Get a reverse angle. Megumi, get the slate. Where's the gun? Reverse angle! Moving the camera! - You had the gun. - Sorry. - Gaira! - Coming. We need a gun to shoot a movie. Get it? "Diploma" OK, guys? We don't need it! - We don't! - Burn it! Yes! OK... Kinuyo. Here! Akiko. Here! Seiichi. Here! Goro. Here! They're alight! And cut. Cut! OK? That's how the scene goes. Can you get a close up of each one? I'll get Tokiko first. It'll take forever! Good morning. Forget Mount Fuji! Give it to me! The high schoolers unite against the system and Mt. Fuji symbolizes the Royal Family... Forget themes. Ideas won't be exposed on film! - You never learn! - But... Ito. Let's do this in one long take! OK. Reload it, Gaira! Reloading! Come on! From the top! Positions! Quickly! They have the diplomas! Sorry, I'll get them. Come on! What did you do? Focus! Focus on the set! Sorry! - Spook! - There's a spare. Hey, you. You're out of frame. Sir... We want your face. See the camera? Sir... - Do it right. - Sir! What? What's the shot number? Who cares? Give me the slate. Go away Out of my sight! Go on! Go on! - Roll! - It's not reloaded. It's getting dark! Shoot! OK, guys? We don't need it. Burn it! - It's tough, huh? - Yes In my experience big studios exploit assistant directors. Who's your enemy? That's why I'm here. Koji Wakamatsu is tough but in a different way. It's alight! Good! And cut! - Well? - I got it. OK, good! That's how you shoot a movie. One day, you'll learn. Yamatoya! We have a script to rewrite. Thank you, sir. How's your autism? Relax. Anyway about the film, we have lots of props but we only need a cross. Megumi. - Yes! - Everyone! I need a vocal check. Is that good? We're all set and ready. All set, Director. OK. Are you ready, Spook? Yes. Take 1. We're recording. Why did the star grow a tail? A shooting star Why doesn't the star lose its tail? A shooting star The tail reveals that he's a dog That he is a beast The End April, 1969: Answer print screening of Gewalt! Gewalt: shojo geba-geba Did Oshima come up with that title? Yeah. Gewalt means violence. Oshima doubled it for Waka. Right. What did you think, Yamatoya? Yeah, it was awesome. Incredible. Do you mean it? Of course. Is the wise man flattering a fool? Waka has a knack. You mean I don't, Matsuda? Your movies have too many ideas but Waka's don't. You two are just different. But basically you lack talent! You've never made a movie, Okishima! You need my help! You punk Save it 'til we get to the bar. What are you guys saying? I know, you're bad-mouthing me. Nozomi. Yes. It's Megumi. Megumi, lei's go. If he took us for a drink he'd have to pay so... Keep him company. Go. Come on, Megumi! OK, see you. "Maeda Bar" We eat, shit and sleep... What's the point of life? Doesn't anything enrage you? What do you want to smash? That's what I want. The world is corrupt and the film industry is full of shit. So I make movies. I thought you wanted to kill cops? Right! Those pigs are the lowest. Once you have power, you lose respect for others. They even took a look up my anus. What..? It was in jail. You don't know? Waka was a thug in Shinjuku working for the Yasuda clan. You were a yakuza? Yeah. I left home at 17 and made my mom cry a lot. Hello, guys. Hey, it's Fujio Akatsuka! I'm beat. Every day I have deadlines. I can't take it! You should get drunk. Drink up 'til you puke, Megumi. Lucky Waka's with a young girl tonight. She's my new AD. Hello. What were you talking about? About how Waka used to be a yakuza. He did time. He had a fight and... You're under arrest! The guards mistreated him in jail so he decided to make movies where cops get killed. He went straight and became an assistant director. You're free to do anything in manga and movies. You can kill cops. You can have the sun set in the east. Mr. Akatsuka is right. Megumi. Don't you want to kill someone or change something? If you want to be a director, you need passion! Come on, Waka. It's piss time. Akatsuka, don't! What's wrong, Waka? Show the AD how we have no restraints in this world by urinating from a Golden bar onto the world. Stop it! Coming. Don't, Waka. Join us! - Come on. - Don't do it. Stop them! On the world! And pee! Akatsuka! Waka, you loser! It's endless! Aim at the baldy. What the...? Look, huge mushrooms! No offence, Kuma! Free Okinawa! Victory is ours! Crush the Security Treaty! Free Okinawa! Victory is ours! The farmers are opposed to the US military bases. With pride we unite to fight with them! Yes! With pride we'll fight to crush the Treaty We'll continue our fight to help free Okinawa! Saying TV is inferior to movies is a stale argument. By changing one line in a serial TV drama, I can have an impact that is incomparable! My film, Death by Hanging is seen by those who oppose capital punishment and racism. So it only reconfirms their beliefs. But artists should challenge those with opposing views. Viewers prefer to identify with Ken Takakura with a sword. Our movies have artistic merit but no drawing power. It's like we are preaching to the converted. We can have an impact on TV viewers. In your Ultraman episode, Sasaki, an astronaut became a monster. Jamira. He'd sacrificed himself to science, and became a creature and returns to get revenge on humans. Raisins! And Ultraman kills him. In a kid's show! As Guevara said, "Create 2nd and 3rd Vietnam." Movies or TV! Not every filmmaker thinks so. Yamatoya and Okishima. You can write for TV. Not me? You're unique. I love watching TV. Afternoon talk shows! And Ginza at night. Shut up If I had to choose it'd be movies. I want to make movies that hold up audiences at knifepoint. Today's movies are no good. I'll crush everything, even the dying movie industry. Right, Mr. Oshima? At knifepoint! Crush everything. That's Koji Wakamatsu. Drinks on me, everyone. On my TV money. Let us toast! Wakamatsu Productions vs. Sozosha! Cheers! I don't know what I want. Me neither. - I have no movies to make. - Me neither. - No interest in politics. - Me neither. Don't patronize me! You can draw, write lyrics and compose I just deal with what's in front of me. If there's anything I'm good at it is... that I'm not a deep thinker. That's my charm. Chao. Spook! "Sex, violence and revolution" I'm Koji Wakamatsu. I fight with my movies. Do you think protests are fun? Why not throw bombs? Or kill cops! Yes! Give it your all or nothing will change. Want some tips on how to be a good AD? Tip 1, procurement. Do you have Mingus? Pithecanthropus Erectus? New records inspire Koji Wakamatsu. Tip 2. find actresses. They can be students, hippies or amateurs as long as they're good. Mr. Wakamatsu hates pros and their hammy acting. Good morning. Sit there. It's so adolescent. What? It's the POV of an introverted victim. It's neatly packaged but unappealing. Open up, Fukuma. Write what only you can write... - It's about a high school serial killer? - Yes. You have to inject rage into the script! Challenge the PTA! OK. And you'll be the protagonist, right? Me? An actress is here. OK. And you are.. My name is Kenji Takama. My classmate. We make movies. We have two Kenjis. Ladies and gents, we're the Double Kenjis. - Same birthday, too. - You get mixed up? Do you act? No, I... You want to direct actors? No, I'm a cameraman... Didn't you direct a film? How was it? No good. I don't think I have what it takes. I'll tell Ito about you. Thank you. I'm hungry. Let's eat a hotpot. Gaira, get us some drinks! Hey! I asked you a question. I know you loved it. Didn't you? What's funny - It just is! What? Because it was boring. Is that all you can do? Don't mock me... Cut! What is it? No film. What the hell? It was a good performance! You think this is a game, college kid? Focus! Focus on the set! I'm sorry. Go away. Out of my sight! Gaira, replace him. OK. Reload it! - Reloading! - It's getting dark. From the top. - Gaira, have this. - Thank you. - Spook. - Thanks. Mr. Wakamatsu. I won't eat. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Eat this. You don't work but you'll eat? You better eat. Megumi! Get the fake blood. Right away. You'll get used to it. "Female Student Guerrilla" "Female Student Guerrilla" So much for Spook's masterpiece. It's great. Wihat did they say is wrong with it? This is Wakamatsu. No municipalities approve of the poster. We can't put them up. We have hundreds of them! Could you give us the funds to do another poster...? No? OK, thank you, sir. Cheap bastard! "Not a penny more." Asshole! I think they disapproved of it because it's good. They thought it was too provocative. Poster regulations... Riot police for the Folk Guerrillas. How oppressive it's getting! Posters have the power to reach people everywhere. Even if they don't go to see the movie. We can have a wild posting. Let's redo it, Spook. Sure. With whose money? Of course they won't get those brainy movies of yours. What will you do with them? When we're so broke... It's your fault! What about the shark extract? No one wants it. I was conned. How about the samurai sword scheme? It's not easy to find people to sell and buy them. Write movies that sell. That's a good idea. That asshole on the phone said our movies are too difficult. Cinema owners don't like them. They do well at Scorpion Cinema and Shinjuku Bunka Cinema. We'll use pseudonyms. Make it really erotic. With no ideologies! Action! Get close to her face. Out of the way. It hurts, remember! You're a virgin... It hurts. Oh, it hurts! Oh. it hurts! Ouch, it hurts! Ouch! "The Conditions of the First Night" Camera by Hideo Ito Lighting by Hajime Isogai Assistants Gaira, Megumi Yoshizumi, Kenji Takama Directed by Tora Osugi What a wimp. You can't make love to me. Shut up! It's so commercial. - It's a sellout! - Be quiet. It's not Wakamatsu. Why's Koji Wakamatsu making a fuckfest commercial film? Relax, sit down. Who's Tora Osugi? We need to talk. Come outside. - This is a screening - You guys aren't serious! I'm serious! Mr. Wakamatsu! Director! The film has none of your usual statements! Just sex! It's just sex but it's still a movie. It's not a Wakamatsu movie! Don't preach to Mr. Wakamatsu! As if he doesn't know! Thanks for caring but we have to make money so we can make statements. It won't work. Can you keep your integrity That's how everyone sells out! We make it work. That's how indie productions survive. Adachi, let's make something we want to make. You had an idea to shoot an entire film on a roof. Yes... Okishima and Gaira, get ready. I'll let you direct soon. How could you write a script like that? It's a sellout! You yelled at the assistant who said that to Waka. It upsets me when he says it. Waka totally owns you now. Don't change the subject. Self financing the movies you want to make is a lot harder than we think. But he shouldn't cross the line. Sometimes Waka loans money from the yakuza so a lot is at stake. People say Waka's films are just porn or unpatriotic... But he never compromises. He's only 33. There are no studio directors that age. I know. I can understand that. But. Can Adachi the screenwriter live with that? I saw him throw your hard work in the trash. It's worse when he tells me directly it's no good and tosses it. But the day after, he'll like it. That's Waka. I see. I know... You like him, don't you? - We're not homos. - You are. But just mentally. You've had too much to drink. I'm not going home. I am. Check please! Are you tough? I'm weak. I'm the nitroglycerin of love. I have to go out. Goodbye. Did you love me ? Mom... I have to go out. Alright! That's OK! August, 1969 Shooting Go, Go, Second Time Virgin Alright! That's OK! August, 1969 Shooting Go, Go, Second Time Virgin It's a masterpiece! August, 1969 Shooting Go, Go, Second Time Virgin It's a wrap on the rooftop. A snapshot, guys. Next up, a couple on the road. - I'll stop cars. - Me too. Whoa! What happened to your sarcasm? Why can't you always be serious? Give me a break! Takama, a group photo! OK. You'll be arrested with that blood! How about your shifty eyes! It's nothing. Waka has a record. Shut up Ready? Say "Cheese!" April, 1970 It's been months... You quitting Go, Go, Second Time Virgin is... a masterpiece. Yes. It's a once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece. But the Pink flick cinemas are empty... Scorpion Cinema has featured Wakamatsu films for months. Both guys and young women watch them. But. Horny old guys avoid those movies. Maybe that's inevitable... A really groovy movie... should reach recluses, the apolitical and the antisocial... If it's a groovy movie it even moves sex maniacs. want to see something that takes the world by storm and makes my eyes shine. But I can't make that happen. I'll have to find another way to do what I want. I was with Mr. Wakamatsu for only a year and half. But it drained all my energy. So I need to go and fili up my tank again. What will we do without you? There's you. I can't replace you. Just be yourself. I don't know yet... what kind of movie to make. If I can go on... You know what? We have so much time for ourselves it's almost cruel. "We have tomorrow like Joe." Is that the Red Army? Don't drink too much. Chao. Spook! Are we ready?. We're rolling. Let's go. Roll it! And.. Action! Cut! Good. It's handheld for the mom's sex. Hand-held? Like this, OK? OK. Don't be cocky! Sorry! - You don't know shit! - I'm sorry! Gaira, get ready! You're useless assholes! - Roll it! - We're rolling! Ready, action! Run! Like your life depends on it! Koji Wakamatsu will kill me! Cut! Move on. OK, that was good, guys. May, 1970 Shooting Kama Sutra: Book of Love The next shot is of... - The crab. Karkataka. - Crab? She holds her thighs up... - Kar... - Karkataka. I'm too stiff for this. It's like yoga. Both are Indian. - Didn't we do it...? - Not yet. How many positions are there? 64. So many! - How many now? - 48. We'd be done if it was Japanese... Megumi. You do the next few. Gaira will help you. - But... - OK, sir! Gome on, Megumi. I'll try harder for you, Megumi. OK, I'll take it. Ouch... OK. Let me go to the toilet. I've got something to tell them. They contradict their own visions. Hey, don't! Good evening. Adachi, how come you're publishing Film Critique again? Kinema Junpo, Film Art and Movie Critics are no good. Will you publish it with Mamoru Sasaki's TV earnings? You completed A.K.A. Serial Killer. Release it! It's too good for the masses. "Too good for the masses"? It's just scenery. You won't release it because you know no one will see it. He likes to make unprofitable movies. And Mr. Wakamatsu! You only like money-making movies. Keep talking, you asshole... What? Are you a man or a woman? A woman. Piss off, bitch! You bastards! Go outside! Calm down! I can take you... or we'll sit and drink. Your choice. We'll drink. Sit with us. Sit down. Thank you. Sorry I called you a dog. I'm just worried! Give them drinks. And he needs some ice. Megumi. You're the First AD now. And you're not? Are you moving up to director? Maybe I'm moving down. Because being an AD won't help me be a good director. Don't you like it here? I love it here too much. Spook quit and now you... Don't be like that. I'll see you again. They'll call me for help. I'll drink tonight while the drinks are on Wakamatsu. You by yourself? Hey! Ask me first. Sorry. Where's everyone? Spook and Gaira quit. Really. You're the First AD? I wasn't told but I guess so. Right. OK. Sorry. Take it easy. - There. - Here? Not there... Sleeping atone Just like a motherless child I have a strange dream... Why did you choose me? You! You hit me when you're mad but you can't rape me. I'm serious. That's why I'm here. Serious about what? You have to explain! I don't understand you. What is death anyway? I'm serious. Alright! Cut. Yoshizawa, you're good. Someone was in shot... Never mind. No one will notice. How was I? Oh, wonderful as usual, Rie! Setting up for a close up. Mieda, come here. Take note of the lenses and the fields of vision. Stand here. Keep the shot clear. OK. Run! OK! Let's roll. We'll rolling! You sloth! Sorry! Quickly! The actors are ready and you're in the way! I'm sorry. Roll it! Rolling! Ready and... Action! Megumi made us work our asses off! She made a killer schedule! That's how you finish it in 4 days. You're the Boss lady now. Hey! Can Takama take the photo, Boss? Please. Waka's saying that you're good! One of a kind! Are we ready? Thank you. Your name please. "Haruhiko Arai, Editor for Film Art magazine" Watch out. All the guys want to beat you up. Why? You know why. You don't review films, you criticize them. I met you at the Seijun Suzuki court case. Right. You lost the Running in Madness Dying in Love argument. You glorify defeat, don't you? You find hope in hopelessness. That's fantasy. Isn't that reality? How else would we find a reason to go on? Quit panning other people's movies and make one. It's more fun. Come to our office. Did you hear the news? What? You're so damn slow! Yukio Mishima broke into the military HQ and died by harakiri! I thought he was just fooling around. Death by harakiri is amazing. But once dead, you're good for nothing. To protect Japan. How do you do that? By protecting the history, culture and tradition centered on the Emperor. Listen up! Don't mindlessly do that. Do it for the world to see. That's a hell of a way to sharpen pencils. Who'd sharpen pencils for the world to see? You're lucky. Why? They never asked me to help on a script. You want to write? And direct a film. You want to direct? I want to be a film director! Not an auteur! You're right... I wanna be a director but I don't have any ideas. Me neither. Really? I thought directors were intelligent. But Mr. Wakamatsu doesn't even read books. Watching him makes me think maybe I could direct. But can I last 3 years? Right... March, 1971 March, 1971 Keep going. Keep going. I have the heavier end. Are you OK? Don't damage it! Is it too heavy, Arai? I can manage! - Upstairs. - Oh, shit. - Watch out. - Don't let go! It's heavy... Hold on. You're so useless, Arai. You do it! Shut up and do it. Sometimes, just like a motherless child... Megumi and Shinohara met through you? Yes. Now they'll live together, like lovers. Megumi might steal your girlfriend! That'd be interesting. Listen Arai. No sex allowed here. Why are you here, Takama? You like Megumi? I'm here because no one else can drive! Oh, sure. I know Megumi can't be feminine on a Wakamatsu set but she could...you know? What? I mean... Femininity has no place in my work. That old guy's rude! Get out of my way! You nag me when you're drunk... Maybe she loves you! Yes, I do. I need to pee. He dumped you. He escaped! - What an idiot. - Arai, shut up. Sleeping alone just like a motherless child I have a strange dream I'm dreaming a dream in a dream Go, Saito! You've had too much to drink. Sorry. "The hell with an autopsy." "No one can understand what's inside me." So said the girl who committed suicide at Meiji University. It would make a good movie. You want to understand what she was thinking? Help me write it. I quit being a woman, you know. I like your tough attitude but it's OK to open up sometimes. Here. Any ideas? A 17-year-old woman who killed herself in 1949 wrote this. Nobuko Nagasawa... She survived a war and killed herself. Maybe she did it because she survived. "Why do I describe my act. Departure?" "It wasn't out of egotism or posturing." "All my life I've advanced at a steady pace" "but it was a miserable step backwards." We can have young people's suicide notes on the screen. The protagonist is a junior high student. She believes in free love and gets pregnant. She'll have the baby for everyone to raise. That's good. But maybe men can't understand her. I'd ask who the father is. The men start to fight over her. What will happen next, Arai? Don't make me do all the thinking. Marry me. Don't suffer tike an adult and abort the baby... Marry me. Leave me alone. But I can't. Don't you remember that sex defeated us? My body felt nothing and my soul wasn 't rescued. Cut! April, 1971 Shooting Gushing Prayer It's not right! April, 1971 Shooting Gushing Prayer You don't look pregnant. You don't look pregnant. OK... - Camera test! - No, roll it. Are you sure? We're rolling! Let's do it! OK, guys. Ready... Action! We keep showing formulaic movies. You should make a movie that shocks the world. Mr. Kuzui. How about a movie about Jiro Soka, bombing Tokyo? Bang-bang! Jiro Soka? The serial bomber. Do young people know him? Since ATG is producing Waka's movie, it should be radical. Yeah...that's right. Come here, Wako. Meet Mr. Wakamatsu. I've seen many of your movies over and over again. My name is Wako. Let me be your apprentice! Visit me at my office. May I? Sure. Thank you, sir! Good for you. Later then. Mr. Wakamatsu, I have to go. I'll think about the Jiro Soka story. I appreciate it. Was it too radical? It'll be OK. Koji Wakamatsu is shooting a movie! Finally Art Theatre wants Koji Wakamatsu... By the way, do you know the movies they show at love inns? They show edited Pink flicks to fit their time slots. A 1-hour movie is too long? Right. I said we could make 30-minute flicks. They'll finance that! Any ideas? Some 30-minute simple stories for love inns. 30 minutes... That's long enough for a fable. Beginning with Long, long ago told with a modern twist. Peach Boy has a big dick and uses sex to make allies. He fights the authorities with a dog, monkey and pheasant. We can make a series! This will sell. Adachi, write it by tomorrow. I have the ATG movie. Let the young guys do it. Megumi and Arai. You can do it. Write a good one, Megumi. You can direct it. OK. Eat up the beans! OK. Ouch... Up I get. "And the woman disappears in Shinjuku." "The End" A turtle? It must be the Taro Urashima fable. Yeah... Weil? It's based on her encounter with us weirdos and how she couldn't be a hippie again. Oh, well. Remember, this is for love inns. Get the sex right. I'll shoot Arai's White Hare. It's you against me, Ms. Yoshizumi! You're playing Taro Urashima. You're about to get married but you don't want to. And you meet an older man and have the best sex ever. So he is your Deep Sea Princess. This is the Deep Sea Palace. You got that? OK? Ready I'm lost. Good. This will work. We'll cover the wide shot in this setup. Can you do a handheld shot to get the man's POV? I'll be where he is with the camera? Right. OK. - You sure? - Yes You're the Deep Sea Princess, OK? - Are you in character? - Yes OK, we're rolling! Ready and action! You turned my life upside down. I'll smash it for you. I'd love that! God, it's so good! Hey, Megumi. That was good. Right, Arai? Uh...yeah. The shaky POV shot was like a French movie. Right, Adachi? Yeah. Arai. You're lucky I shot your boring script. I made a masterpiece out of it! Add 30 more minutes and make it into a feature. You and Arai write it. Megumi. Yes? How long were you with us? 2 years or so. That explains it. Come on, Arai. I'll treat you to something. May, 1971 ...and he'd shoot a gun! Waka! Adachi! I'm glad you're here. Mr. Oshima. Are you by yourself? You're off to Palestine after Cannes? That's right. We made 8 million yen on Kama Sutra and I asked Adachi how we should use it. He said we'd made so many movies already so we could go back underground. When I asked what he meant he said, Palestine. Right? Everyone in Japan is protesting against the Vietnam War. No one knows about Palestine. So we'll film the Palestinians fighting the Israelis. No one in Japan has done it. for good money. You know why no one's done it? Because it's risky? Jews control movie industries around the world. You'd better watch out if you want your movies shown overseas. Godard shot a pro-Palestinian movie called Jusqu'a la victoire. But something happened during editing. Possibly even Godard's project was sabotaged. Adachi. I won't stop you but be careful about involving Waka. Well, he just wants footage to sell to Japanese TV stations. I shouldn't worry then... You gave me a good idea of what to expect, Mr. Oshima. Thank you for your concern. Remember, I want you to produce a film for me, with global appeal. Are you looking for something? My Hanafuda cards! I saw them... You're taking them? - Of course! - I found them. Hanafuda cards? - To Cannes and Palestine. - What! To get footage for TV. Right then! Arise ye prisoners of starvation! Stop that song! - He hates it. - Does he? Sure! Look at Guevara and Castro! Famous revolutionaries are born affluent. Starving children are sacrificed in revolutions. Same with wars. So it has to be Arise ye who aren't starving. Right? Yeah. See you. - Take care of business. - Waka. Got your passport? Yes. - Take care of things! - OK. Have a nice trip! If you can't betray yourself before others betray you You can't kill a man or commit a crime This makes no sense... Why did you have to kill me? Koji Wakamatsu, the director and Masao Adachi, the screenwriter. Are you influenced by any filmmakers, Monsieur Wakamatsu? No one influences me. I make Koji Wakamatsu movies. - How's it going? - No luck. Only Spook can crack it. I can't... What's up? Hi! Spook's here! Oh, memories! What's going on? -I can't unlock it. - Let me. All the way in...and click! - The Shinjuku thief! - I retired. Where's Megumi? She's late. I'm back. - Hey! - It's been ages! Just bread? Caviar. This is the loot! Thieves! It's a big catch! Mama, I have to go out. To Mama, a tour bus pulls over But it's empty as an old bird's nest No, see you again! He betrayed me He promised to smuggle in stuff Panther ausf. D Jean, Miller and Norman Mailer They had their day With an erection The red of the neon It ceases to be a progressive color It's not hot anymore By the knife... They don't have to come back. I know you don't think so. Now we can make the movies we want to make. It's hard when you love them! There he goes. That's how Arai is with women. Watch out! Whoa, what's going on? Arai, you're terminally ill. It's worse than political defeat. I'll give you some medicine. Here, Arai. It's medicine time. Take it now. Mama. I have to go out He's back. Mama, I have to go out For now, let's go to city at night Naked lunch, blood lunch No more impotence and drugs I'll get cleaned up Shigenobu, pose for a photo. OK. I'll show you how to urinate. And me. Me too! Megumi, don't! Megumi, get down. Let go! Prepare the cannons! Ready! Release! Let me join you! People on Meiji-dori Avenue! Behold Wakamatsu Productions' urine! Watch me urinate! Shoot! It's away There's water! One, two... Oh, this feels like heaven! - The guys would have liked this. - It's for girls only. How's it going with Arai? We paired up when our partners fell in love. That makes him feel second best. I don't agree. I tell him I love him but... I'm always the last choice. I know you like Adachi. I like him, too. He doesn't think I'm a woman. You're a woman, for sure... Cut it out, Shinohara! Hey! They train all the time. We were already training from 6 am with the Palestinian commandos. Digging bunkers and crawling along ropes. When it came to handling guns, they said I'd be a good commando. They said I was the best. Filmmakers are good at taking aim. I'd aim at a tree and Bang! It's a hit They told me I had what it takes. After about 2 weeks they told us that we'd only have one more day. We were given carte blanche to film that day. That was what we'd hoped for. Adachi and I were filming all over the place. Then suddenly they told us to leave the mountain. By t'hen we'd become very close to them. They came to hug us goodbye. They gave us lots of kisses and pats. We felt bad about leaving them behind. We managed to get back to Beirut. And the momirng after... Shigenobu came to our hotel. She told us that the guys on the mountain were wiped out by the Jordan offensive. I checked the paper. There was a photo of the commandos being hung in a public execution. I felt so bad for them that I bawled. They were truly kind people. They cared about us. They knew they'd get attacked so they told us to leave. Adachi and I had a talk. We died there with those guys. We'd have to carry out our Palestinian friends' mission. So we won't sell it to TV. You'll make it into a movie? Yes. We won't show it in cinemas. We'll organize a screening tour across Japan. We'll buy a bus and travel around on it. The movie and its distribution will be revolutionary. That's how a movie about a revolution should be. We might as well paint the bus red. And paint the title on the side. Yeah! We've decided on the title. What is it? The Red Army- PFLP: Declaration Of World War. Isn't it good? It's cool. I'll take student activists who've left school and want action. Arai, you're the tour leader. I joined you because I'm done with activism... I don't care who's the leader but send back the profits! - What's new! - Of course! We spent a fortune! We need to make another movie before the ATG movie. Take care of that, Megumi. Sure. You're not eating at all! Eat up. There's so much left! Don't leave any, Arai and Saito. How was Cannes anyway? It's like Atami beach resort. It's good so far. Here. This is where we superimpose Gunpoint in reverse. Why? Because commandos don't target citizens. Right. Do you think the audience will get it? Yes. They'll be politically minded. You're right. Oh, Megumi is here. - You want something? - No OK, fast forward. You only think of things like reversing Gunpoint. It's a good idea, isn't it? It's a step away from being nonsense. Come on! Wako! Yes? We're out of paint. OK. - Back to work. - OK. - Here. - Thanks. - Hi, guys. - Wanna help? Yeah. Hi, Megumi. Shinohara. Yes? Have you had an abortion? You mean, a baby? Yes. When I broke up with my ex I found out I was pregnant. Arai carne with me. Right... Like a teen movie. - Working hard? - Hello! Megumi, why are you here? Who's making the movie? OK. You're so bad! You're wasting money Arai, don't smoke now! You don't understand what work means. Did Waka and Adachi change after they returned from Palestine? Yes... Well... Movies or activism? It's a tough choice. Will you write for us? I'm working on a TV cartoon called Lupin The Third. I'm too busy. OK... The Security Treaty protests failed but this movie tour is the beginning of new comradery and solidarity. That's so true. Who else would think of a red bus? Vietnam and Palestine share a problem. Also Okinawa and Sanrizuka. Don't let our internalized defeatism hold us back. Right on, Toyama! That's a beautiful ring, Toyama. - Mom gave it to me. - Good mormning. Who made this rice ball? I did. Your name? I'm Toyama. Toyama, you've never made a rice ball? Learn how to make rice balls then talk about revolution. Will you go on the red bus? I guess not. I thought so. If you went, who'd make movies? Waka told me that, too. Wakamatsu Productions is suddenly an activist group. not a film company. The Taro Urashima fable... What? Now I understand how Taro felt left out. You'll have your chance. Watch out. Good. I might quit movies. We're done. You remind me of my dad. Huh? You asked me why I slept with you. I couldn't answer then, so... Sex is no big dea!. We'll have sex and I'll get pregnant. If we raise the baby properly that'll be our victory against sex. Aborting the baby would be our defeat. You were defeated by everything including sex. What are you doing here? I've loved watching movies since I was little. I'm from Hokkaido, but went to schools in Tokyo. Junior high in Yotsuya. Got expelled from high school. My mother married twice and divorced twice. I don't see my father. When I was at kindergarten I lived with Grandma and Mom visited sometimes. Mom lives how she wants and says that I should too. It was good being left on my own. I see. Isn't it hard being a female assistant director on Pink sex films? To a certain degree. My appetite for food and sex has dulled. I intentionally became numb, I guess... Watching a movie and making one is 180 degrees different. It's a different dimension. A single cut can convey what a thousand words can't. That's why movies are awesome. Movies are awesome... But. one day I'll confront the Director... ...Koji Wakamatsu at knifepoint. I don't think I can avoid it. It's all about who'll survive me or him. We'd do it without violence. It's really crazy, filmmaking... It's difficult because you are your worst enemy... "Your worst enemy?" Wakamatsu Productions. It's me. You know who it is? I'm on my way to Hokkaido to take train photos. Right. OK. Gotta go. I'm being interviewed. Oh.. Bye. "The Red Army- PFLP: Declaration Of World War" I can see myself changing. There's no closure and I don't mind. I have unsolved issues I should've left behind. Including... my own fucking womanhood. Hey, Megumi. Arai and the guys are drinking after finishing the rough cut. Adachi and Makiko will be there. Coming? No. OK. See you later then. Sleeping alone Just like a motherless child I have a strange dream I'm dreaming a dream in a dream Sometimes Just l ike a motherless child I'm embraced in my dream In the dream I'm embraced by a breast of light Hello, it's me. I know. It's been ages. I'm fine. How about you? I just wanted to hear your voice. Mom... Right. Thanks. I love you, Mom. I'm embraced in my dream In the dream I'm embraced by a breast of light I go alone, like a motherless child Like a stray bird, flying to the end of the world Sorrow is a sign that you're alive Out of my way Let me pass! You can't. Megumi! She's like my own daughter! Waka! Megumi! Let me pass or I'll beat you to death! Move! Megumi! Megumi! It's been a while. Takama... Where's everyone? Is Megumi here? Takama. You don't know? What? Megumi... She's dead. Sleeping pills and whiskey. Harada went to her place because we wanted to shoot there. And he peeped inside and saw her sleeping, snoring loudly. He didn't want to wake her so he left and returned later and found... Megumi was... already... They found out she was pregnant from... an autopsy. 6 months pregnant... September 30, 1971 We're leaving now! Go get them! Off we go! You'll do fine. Take care of the Tohoku region. Good boys. See you, sir. Get them! So long. What? Come on, our expenses. Make sure you sand half the sales. What about the screenplay? It's on your desk. Arise ye comrades, the workers The day of freedom shall break The day to break the chain of oppression With our flag hoisted high He's singing? No way! 'Tis the final conflict Let each stand in his place The International Union Shall be the human race Arise ye prisoners of starvation The day of victory is near Arise ye comrades, the... The day of freedom shall break "The Angel is Frugal by Masao Adachi" "The Angel is Frugal by Masao Adachi" You clown... "The Angel is Frugal by Masao Adachi" This is Wakamatsu. Is Mr. Kuzui in? Hello, sir. It's me, Wakamatsu. About the ATG movie. I decided not to do Jiro Soka. Right. I'll still have the bombs. Bang-bang. Adachi wrote another weird script so... I'll rewrite it. It's about internal conflict. We'll blow up the police box on 3rd Street. We'll get Yoshizawa to play October. The terrorist protagonist. Yes. Oh, right. Right. I'll blow up the world with this movie! Dedicated to our mentor Koji Wakamatsu and those who lived in his time.
