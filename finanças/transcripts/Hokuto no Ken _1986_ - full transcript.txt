The Big Dipper and the Southern Cross, known as Hokuto and Nanto. They represent dual ity, North and South, male and female, Iight and shadow. Each is also a symboI for a martial art: Hokuto Shinken, Holy Fist of the North Star, and Nanto Seiken, Sacred Fist of the South Star. If these styles were to clash, the world will fall to ruin. But from this chaos, a true savior will emerge... Legend of łhe Cenłury's End Savior Seikimatsu Kyuseishu Densetsu FIST oF THE NORTH STAR HOKUTO NO KEN Production Leader: Tomonori lmada Original story by: Buronson, Tetsuo Hara (Serialized by Shueisha in "Shounen Jump Weekly") Storyboard : Ken Ariga, Yoshio Takami Production Editor: Shoji Kishimoto Screenplay: Susumu Takaku Music: Katsu hisa Hattori (Soundtrack: Pony Canyon Records) Theme Song : "Heart of Madness" Lyrics, composition, arrangement: Tsuyoshi Ujiki Performed by: Kodomo Band (Pony Canyon Records) Lead Editor: Masaaki Hanai Sound : Taneyoshi Koseki Cinematography: Tamio Hosoda Art Director: Shiko Tanaka Art Assistant: Kazuo Ebisawa Animation Director: Masami Suda Directed by: Toyoo Ashida ln the year 199X, the world was engulfed in flames. Those who had evaded death began to fight over food and water. This used to be an ocean. But now, no trace of life remains. I want to see it. I want to see green life retu rn to the Earth, and fish retu rn to the ocean. Yuria... Shin! Shin?? Strength itself is now salvation . What a glorious era it has become... The strongest can take whatever they desire. Shin! Stop it! Back off! Kenshiro, l know you've become the new master of Hokuto Shinken. But you're sti I I no match for my Nanto Lone Eagle style! Shin! The opposing stars can't fight! Have you forgotten the law? I've forgotten those childish myths ! Nanto prison Butchering Fist... Kenshiro... Kenshiro... Kenshiro! What mockery! Brother, how cou Id that be the successor of Hokuto Shinken? K-Kenshiro! Kenshiro, you'll never be able to defeat me. There are two fatal differences between the two of us. They are... desire, and vengeance! Ken ! Shin! The two of you were like Brothers ever since you were children ! And both of your masters taught you that the North and South must never fight. Yuria, the blood of Nanto Seiken flows through your veins, as well. Don't you understand, Yuria? l've Ioved you from afar for so long... The three of us were trained in Hokuto Shinken, even though on Iy one of us can be chosen as heir. Kenshiro's not fit to inherit the style! And yet you said nothing when he was named successor? I haven't forgotten... The fate of a fai Ied Hokuto Shinken student is always the same. Their fists are broken forever, or even their memories erased ! Will you be silent then, Raoh?! Kenshiro, desire and vengeance have brought me victory. You have nothing. Ken ! Kenshiro, with your naive personal ity, you could never survive in this era. I'm the only man who can make Yuria happy. I refuse! Yuria, tel I me you Iove me. I Iove Kenshiro. If you kill him, l will die alongside him ! So, you won't say it? I wonder how many it will take to kill him? Kenshiro! You're the only one who can save him now, with j ust one little phrase... l want you to do it on your own. Shin, If you're gonna kill me, j ust get on with it! Yuria... pleas...n'...e. Liv... fo... sake! Very well, l will . Die! I always resented you anyway.. . so die! Stop! Don't say it, Yuria ! I Iove you ... What? l cou Idn't hear you. Do you think my heart will be moved by that wan ing performance, Yuria? If you really Iove me, then say it with feel ing! I Iove you ! I will stay by your side until the day I perish ! So please, don't kill Ken ! Did you hear that, Kenshiro? A woman who said she'd die for you has just said she'II be at my side for life! Nothing is more terrifying than a woman's fickle heart. This man is already a corpse, Yuria. He can't survive in this brutal new world. But fear not, I won't deliver the final blow. Ken ! Kenshiro.. . Ken ! Yuria, we're leaving. Yuria... Yuria ! Ken ! Ken ! Ken ! What do we do now, Brother? Kenshiro is doomed. You will be the new Hokuto master. l'll grant the title of successor to you . What? You mean it, Raoh?! Wait! Are you sure, Raoh? Yuria... Yuria... Ken, l will make the flowers bloom all over the Earth once again. Isn't it funny, Kenshiro? From this day onward, I'll be the successor of Hokuto Shinken ! No little Brother should outclass his elder! Fall straight to Hell ! Raoh? Father, if you believe you can destroy my fists... Then show me what you can do! Even my own father can't destroy me. You've prepared for this, Raoh. Those not chosen as successor to Hokuto Shinken will never again wield that power! You made a grave m istake choosing Hokuto Shinken's successor, Father. Kenshiro is dead. What?! Hokuto Shinken is no more! No one in this world can destroy my fists. Raoh, what are you trying to prove? Hokuto Sh in ken must not be misused. I take orders from no man. Wha...desire... ar......avens! To hold Heaven itself in my fist. The tradition of a Hokuto Shinken master is meaningless now! Perhaps, Raoh. But as the man who made your fists what they are, I cannot allow this! What? Answer me, Heaven ! I will rule you as l see fit. I will fight any angel or demon who stands in my way. I will be the Supreme Ruler of the New Century! The oceans dried up. Yet time continued to flow on the cracked su rface of the Earth. It once again became an era ruled by violence. I knew it! These guys were transporting food. Hey, not so rough ! Break it more and it'I I never move. Anyway, it mig ht be worth raiding that village those kids came from. We should h urry back and tell Lord Zeed about this. Shit, you worth Iess piece of j u nk! Hey! That's my car! Whoa, you still alive, you little brat? Damn it, get your filthy mitts off my car! Take all the food you want, just Ieave my wheels alone! What a lively little prick! Oh, what's this? Seeds? Hell, as if we cou Id ever grow rice again... Hey! That h urt you brat! Come on, Iet's send a message to their village by ki l Iing them both ! Hey, hey, hey! Time to die, small fry! You little... Take this! Asshole! Son of bitch... Get that punk! Ho-holy crap! Hey, M ister, why did you save us back there? Because that girl called me. That's ridiculous! I mean, it doesn't make any sense... Lin can't talk, you know? Her whole fam i Iy was killed right in front of her during the war. The shock took away her ability to speak. I guess I'm not much better off, hu h? Bu...wonder... wh............l......ared? Bring as much food and water as you can carry to Lord Zeed. If you refuse, I'I I rip this girl's head off! EIder, we refuse. We wou Id rather fight! Oh really? Let's j ust see how that goes... Who was that! ? Who fed me that rock! Bastard ! Who do you th ink you are? Filthy coward ! Now you've really pissed us off! You. Let her go. Who, this little brat? I'll crush her to a pulp! Your little fist is nothing compared to my power! I'll tear you apart! You're already dead. What? Hokuto Shinken ! Hokuto Shinken is a fearsome martial art style born in Ch ina long ago. The Holy Fist of the North Star style drives energy into the opponent's flesh, causing them to rupture. By attacking the interior and exterior of the body sim u Itaneously... lt has been recognized as the u Itimate assassins style. I'm Ken . Kenshiro. I heard you r name is Lin. You were the one who called me? Lin, you're hurt. Don't worry. Stay still. What did you do? I returned her abil ity to speak. You mean she can talk now? Give me a break... There are flower seeds in this bag. I know the world is bleak now, but l believe you have the power to grow them. He's leaving? Yeah. Never saw a guy that strong before... Lin, did you just-?! Ken .. . Ken ! You're a man?! Who the hel l are you ! Who, me? I'm Rei. Rei of the Nanto Suichoken style. If I take on the form of a woman, scum Iike you crawl right to me. But there's only one thing that you feeble creeps are good for... You're always carrying some food for me. Gimme a break! Bastard ! Hey, you forgot these. My arms ! My arms! You bastard ! So, bastard... Do you know the man with seven scars?! Oh, that's rich ! He could n't answer! Okay, bring out the next one. PIease don't! I don't know anything ! Good, you Iook pretty smart. You'II probably know... Go ahead, tell me this man's name. I can't, I have no idea who he is ! What's that? You don't recognize him from the seven scars on his chest? This is the master of Hokuto Shinken, Lord Kenshiro! So say it. L-Lord Kenshiro... Oh, good answer! Lord Kenshiro is correct, sir. And as a reward, you get to saw this g uy's head off! Come on, pick it up. Do it now! I can't do it! PIease stop! What's that? You can't do it? Tell it to Lord Kenshiro! So the man with seven scars who defeated Zeed is just a tyrant! Are there no saviors in this world? What the hell was that? Gramps, say that one more- Who're you?! I see. The man with seven scars was Kenshiro of Hokuto Shinken. Whoa, hold it! You son of a bitch... You've got spi rit! As a reward, I'I I let you handle the saw. I'm sure you can do it. Does sawing your head off feel good? Of course! It's a great way to relax. So give it a try. What? That's strange... Well? Are you relaxed yet? I didn't mean me! You prick! Hey you , BIade Boy. Tell me the whereabouts of this man with seven scars. You bastard, I'll kill you ! Who? L..........! Don't you all want to know the real name of that man? Shut UP! Stupid piece of- Hokuto Shinken ! I'Il tell you . His name is... Jagi ! And I used to call him "Brother". Airi . Pol ish them well. Yes, my Lord. Lick them clean. Are my shoes too dirty? No, my Lord ! You're my slave. Don't you respect me? Why me? l mean, why a man with seven scars? Don't misunderstand me, l still don't trust you. Rei, please tel I me why. l must defeat my older Brother Jagi. Fine. If he defeats you, you'd never know anyway. This cape was supposed to be worn on my sister Airi's wedding. But in these dark times, pretty young women are prized commodities. In my absence, he invaded my village, killed everyone in sight... Murdered my parents, and took Airi away. It was a man with seven scars. I refuse to watch my younger Brother become master over me. Tell Father that you refuse to be his heir! Brother! Why do you rely on guns? Why don't you fight with your fists! I don't care if it's with martial arts or toys, l will win by whatever means are necessary! Give it a rest! You dare defy me, little Brother? I'll kill you ! Damn you ... You have no right to be successor. Get out of my sight! That wretch... Kenshiro is still alive? Lord Jagi, I've called Heart. Lord Jagi? Hey! I... l didn't s-see anything... Why are you scared? Do you really hate my face that much? You're Iaugh ing aren't you... You find my face amusing ! No! No, I wouldn't... l'm not as forgiving as my little Brother... So, you think your Brother is here with Airi? I do. So the slags are on their way... Airi, come here. I have an amusing task for you. Yes, my Lord. So, you're I il' Kenshiro? I'm Heart. I have orders from Lord Jagi to destroy you. Pigs belong in their pen. So l'm a pig, am I? How clever. Go ahead, put me where l belong. My flesh is as soft as rubber. Your fighting style won't work on me if you can't penetrate my blubber. My body is bui It to destroy fighters just l ike you ! What's the matter? Are you finished? What's wrong? Need me to handle this? No need. Hokuto Sh in ken is invincible! Is that so? Prepare to die anyway! Idiot! My flesh ! My precious flesh ! You're already a wal king corpse. Die! Goodness, that was nothing to worry- Jagi ! You made it, Kenshiro... lt was you ! That's right. He's your man with seven scars... the man who killed your parents and kidnapped Airi. L'd heard there was a Nanto Suichoken master who lived there. So that was you? Come! Master, what do you desire? I will do whatever you want. Airi... I understand. l will follow my new Master. PIease take good care of me. l'll do whatever you ask. Airi, your eyes ! She saw my face and was disgusted, so l took away her sight. You'll pay for this! What's wrong, man of Nanto? I see, you Iove you r sister that much? If you want to save her, kill him. Rei, don't play into his hand. What's wrong? Don't you treasu re your sister? Calm down, Rei ! He's not a man to keep his promises. But my sister... That's right! Siblings should take care of each other. Your sister still remained loyal to you ! Indeed, a little Brother ought to have respect for his big Brother. That's right! I remember, I remember everything ! You always treated me Iike a fool ! Jagi, how cou Id l respect you? First you rely on guns, and then on hostages... And now now a Waterfowl style master! Are you unable to defeat me yourself? Is that any way to speak to your elder?! You will show me respect! Lord Jagi? Very well. I'll end this once and for all, man-to-man. You two, kill that Nanto bastard ! Go ahead, pick your grave site. You don't deserve to live! My hatred for you has kept me alive all these years. And was that why you soiled my name with those vil Iainous deeds? Those who defied me were all killed. None of those vermin could understand I iving with pain I ike this! Every time these wou nds bring me pain, my hatred for you increases. Jagi, why did you toss me off a cliff instead of delivering the final blow? Our Brother Raoh told me to do it. Raoh did? He thought that was an appropriate demise for you, but no matter... I'll Iet you taste the horrors of Hell once more. I'm no longer the Jagi you knew. Come on. Hokuto Arhat Attack! Let's see you dodge the impossible speed of my fists! Impossible... That just can't be! Use your gun . Be my guest. If you really th ink it'd kill me. Fool ! It doesn't matter how, as long as you win in the end ! I hit your vital point, Kyosetsu. If you don't Iet it go, you'II pu II the trigger. You've changed too, I see. You're faster now, and more skilled... but you're still too cocky, Kenshiro! I filled this with gas as my trump card ! This bui Iding is ti Ited your way. I'Il burn you right back to Hell ! You still don't see that you are the one who will die here! I'm really going to enjoy watching you roast alive! But l might as well give you a little going away present... I was the one who convinced Shin, Nanto Seiken master, to take Yuria from you ! What? I hated you. When you became successor you even had Yuria within your grasp! I could see that Shin Ioved Yuria, and used that to turn him against you... Shin, why are you giving up? You know how naive Kenshiro is. He can't protect Yuria in these troubled times. Any man could steal her away... Can you accept that, Shin? It's true. You're the man who can make Yuria happy. Yuria is, after all, of Nanto blood. What are you waiting for? Take her... Take her. Take her from him ! You did that to Shin?! Exactly. You became my casualty! You really thought a little Brother could outwit his own elder Brother? How does it feel? Does it hurt? Tell me! Shin was like a Brother to me, ever since we were children... Yet you convinced him to take Yuria from me! And who might I be? Say my name! The master of Hokuto Sh in ken, Lord Jagi ! Wh-what the?! What power! How cou Id you have... Eat this! Have you already forgotten the true power of Hokuto Shinken? I don't want to die! Save me! Where is Yuria? She's Iiving with Shin, in the city of Southern Cross. PIease, help me! It's too Iate. Your body will disappear from this world in ten seconds. Yuria's heart belongs to Shin now. Finding her won't help! Does it hurt, Kenshiro? Raoh entrusted the Hokuto arts to me! lt's mine now, so what's that make you? Say my name, Kenshiro! Admit it! l am the Hokuto Sh in ken master, Lord Ja- Yuria, Sh in .. . and now, Raoh? Airi ! It's me, your Brother Rei. Of course, my new Master. I will do your bidding. I'I I do anything, so please take good care of me. Airi... Airi .. . Airi ! Kenshiro, will she ever return to normal? I've removed the darkness and madness that consumed her. In time, she'II go back to her former self. Southern Cross... Yuria. Hey. What's up? It's you ! Ken, Iook... Yuria's flower. Lin... you did this? YUP. This is... my wedding veil ! That's right, Airi. You were sUPposed to wear that. Brother, is it really you? Yes, it's me! Come on, open your eyes and Iook at me! No! Don't Iook at me. I've been soiled. I'm not the Airi you love anymore... Airi... It's no good, Kenshiro. Airi is afraid to open her eyes. I'm better off this way. I don't want to see anymore! I don't blame you . It's probably better not to Iook at this ugly world these days. Exactly. l j ust don't want to face anyth ing. Don't say th ings Iike that! l'll make this a pretty place to live in ! Lin... lf we work together, we can grow flowers, and trees, and tomatoes, cucumbers, apples, and wheat too! We can make all sorts of things come to I ife again ! Look. Is that... a flower? lt's a flower bud ! I never thought there wou Id be flowers again... There is, but you'II never see it if you don't open your eyes! There really is a flower! How did you grow it? Can we really make flowers grow again? I'm glad to be alive... I'm so glad... That girl, and this man... Could they change this dark age? Yuria, you're as beautifu I as ever. Again? Yuria, you don't I i ke the jewels I give you? You don't I ike this life? What I want is a man with the kindness of the ocean. Who shines Iike the fields. Who's warm as the sh ining sun. Who smel Is I ike the Earth itself. Who smel Is I ike the Earth? You mean Kenshiro? He's dead now. Yuria, you now have the most Iuxurious life on the planet. What more cou Id you want? I want the Earth to be covered in green once more. Green what? What are you saying, Yuria? In this age, the Earth can't support life. Look arou nd you, the Earthis dead. The whole world is just an endless barren wasteland. Not even weeds can grow. But turn your eyes to the city of Southern Cross! I built this city in your name. This city is a sanctuary from the dying world. You will bear my children, and we'll live peacefully in this city. We were only able to cover these ruined grou nds in greenery. I n this age, what power is there but violence? I was the only man who cou Id make you happy. Yuria, if you had stayed with Kenshiro, another man would've killed him and taken you. PIease open your heart to me Yuria ! Kenshiro is as dead as the world itself. Yuria... wha...beautif...name. She is of Nanto blood, just Iike you . Ryuuken, my father, arranged for us to be married once l was chosen as successor. So your father planned to unite Hokuto with Nanto, to signify an era of peace. Kenshiro, you're a mysterious man. You remind me of the way my father used to smell. Maybe you'll be the one to end the violence of this world. I couldn't care less. AI I l want is to take back Yuria, and restore order to Hokuto Shinken. I think you'll do so much more than that Kenshiro. Ken-Oh is here! The Fist King has arrived ! Ken-Oh is the Supreme Ruler of the New Century! Ken-Oh's army Iays waste to all, leaving only corpses in its' wake! Listen up, Ken-Oh ! This is my territory. The Fang CIan and I j ust want to live in our own wretched Iand. What do you have to gain here? If you attack us, you will receive nothing. There's stil I time to turn back. But if you refuse.. . We'll slaughter every one of you ! Advance! Stu bborn ass... Counter attack! You're insane! Don't you know fear? H uashan Steel Armor FIex! So, how do you I ike my metal-hard body? Strike me any way you can ! I toId you those wou Idn't work against me. I'll kill every one of you myself. Bring it on ! Call it, Ken-Oh. You're just wasting your men now. Why not just fight me yourself? Go on, hit me! Insolent bastard ! How dare you speak to the Fist King I ike that! L'I I start at the horse and work my way up! You pu nk, don't get weird on me! You got a death wish? I don't know how you struck me... But I told you, nothing can break my body! What are you gon na do with just one hand? Fine, give me your best shot! M...d... mad... steel... ...l......a......n'...rk! Men like him are worthless in this age. Eliminate the rest. Yuria, I must go out into battle. Someone calling himself the Fist King is on the warpath. He's approaching Southern Cross. I pray for your victory. Is that all you have to say? I am a sacred warrior going into battle for you ... Bad news, sir. They've passed the G-Point. What? Just what does Ken-oh expect to accomplish in this era? There's more, sir! The self-proclaimed master of Hokuto Shinken, Jagi, has been beaten. The one who defeated him was the man with seven scars, Kenshiro. Kenshiro! Kenshiro, you survived! I'll hurry to your side. Up until now, I've been a living corpse... But starting today, I will live! I will live for you, Kenshiro! Where is Yuria? Bring her to me! Got it, the barrier is breached. Did you see Yuria? With all due respect, sir, now is not the time! Ken-Oh and h is troops are outside! "Now is not the time," you say? PIease forgive me, sir! Miserable cur! Yuria is the very reason this city exists. Yuria is everything to me! Sunlight! Ken-Oh 's army is here. And yet, Yuria, I on1y ever fought for you... Making you mine was my one reason to 1ive. Without you, I can 't... Are you Ken-Oh? Your woman is in my care now. What's that? You came all this way just to tell me that? I'm pleased. l have a new reason to live! I will kill you and retrieve Yuria. Very good. l expected no Iess from you. Strike me, Shin. What...? That must be Southern Cross... Yuria ! Shin... Kenshiro. I'm surprised you made it all this way. Congratulations. I've climbed from the very depths of Hell to defeat you ! What caused this change in you? Vengeance... You taught me the true meaning of the word. Vengeance! Then show me j ust how strong this "vengeance" of yours is. Where's Yuria? If you really care, find her yourself. Die, Kenshiro! You... you'r...thin...ke th...ns......remember. Shin, l can read all your moves. Kenshiro.. . You've become very strong... Shin, those scars are from... Hokuto Shinken? You're too Iate Kenshiro. Yuria will never forgive me. I tried to g ive her everything that she cou Id ever want... But she always had you in her heart. She could never forget you... Shin, where is Yuria? Yuria was supposed to wear this for me at our wedding... But she's no longer here. What do you mean? Yuria fell into Raoh's hands. What?! The Fist King, Supreme Ruler of the New Century... That's what your Brother Raoh has become! He's Raoh? He Ieft these Hokuto fist marks in my body as a message to you. ...ssag...... me? Kenshiro, Raoh has taken Yuria to Cassandra, the City of Crying Demons. Cassandra... The City of Crying Demons. I truly Ioved Yuria. I wish that I cou Id have died by your hand... By the hand of a man who Ioves the same woman l Iove. Shin! Go, Kenshiro... Go to Cassandra... Here Iies a man who Ioved the same woman that I Iove... Ken-Oh ! Ken-Oh ! Very good, j ust Iike that! Let's hear those voices! Hey sh ithead, your tempo's off. AII right scumbags, let's hear it Ioud and clear! Ken-Oh ! Ken-Oh ! Ken-Oh ! Supreme Ruler of the New Century... Ken-Oh and h is army. Wow! I'm gon na have a Iook! Me, too! Hey, be careful ! You'II get crushed. What's wrong, BIack King? That was scary. Nyah ! Miss Yuria ! That's just got to be Miss Yuria ! My strength has allowed me to take anything l want. I've destroyed everyone that has opposed me. Neither Hokuto nor Nanto can stop me! I will yet claim the Heavens in the name of Ken-Oh ! And yet, someth ing is about to happen... Something happening before its' own time. Say what? That woman was Miss Yuria? I could tell. It has be Miss Yuria ! Maybe, but isn't Yuria supposed to be at Southern Cross right now... lt j ust doesn't add up! But l'm sure of it. That was Miss Yuria. Sh...st... well......st b...r.........aso... another. Bat, if Lin says it's her, then l believe it's Yuria. Huh.. . l wonder where that coach went? Okay! I guess I'll just have to go Iook! Look for her? But Bat... Cassandra Castle isn't far. Yuria is probably in there. Bat... l've only survived this long by being a thief, so Ieave it to me! 'Kay? I guess l should Iook for an underground entrance... The irrigation route is at the Southern entrance, so it's about 3.5 degrees that way... So if you take the floor plan into consideration... Lin, you didn't have to come! This is j ust to see if Yuria's even here. I know, but l want to meet Miss Yuria. I want to show her this flower and cheer her up. You piece of... It's no use. It's rusted shut! Bat! All right, can we make it through? Miss Yuria ! A flower! This flower... lt's your flower, Miss Yuria. I grew it from a seed Ken had. Ken ! Kenshiro! Kenshiro... Miss Yuria, be brave. That's right, Ken will come rescue you ! Tell Kenshiro to stay away! But why? Something terrible will happen ... We're fated to never unite in this world. I decided to accept that fate when I was imprisoned here. Give me a break, rescu ing you is all that's kept Ken going ! Runaway. Hurry! Miss Yuria, don't worry. Kenshiro! Where did that flower come from? These are dark times. Flowers have no place here. This age doesn't want flowers to bloom ! This is an execution ! The traitor is about to be executed! Behold this flower! I never thought l'd live to see a flower again ! The Earth must still be alive! When the Fist King saw this flower, he was greatly disturbed. Someone amongst you caused this flower to grow. Whoever is responsible, step forward now! Otherwise, we wil l kill this woman ! Miss Yuria's in trouble! Lin ! Rei ! I'll rescue Yuria. I am Rei, of Nanto Suichouken ! And l have a message for the "Fist King" : The master of Hokuto Shinken, Kenshiro caused that flower to bloom ! Kenshiro, you say? That flower has sprouted thanks to the love in Kenshiro, Yuria, and Lin's hearts! "Love"? This dark era has no need for "love". Uyghur! Rei, you say? I'll give you a taste of Uyghur's Whip! I came to defeat Ken-Oh. I can't waste my time playing with a pawn like you. What was that?! What's the hold up? Your moves are so slow l almost fell asleep. Damn you ! l'I I slash you to pieces! Doesn't Iook Iike I can tie those together. Taishan Twin Streak Whi p! Ken-Oh, it's you r turn now. Hey, we're not... Well done, Rei of Nanto Suichouken. I'm impressed. Rei ! Stop fighting ! You can't fight him ! Lin... don't worry. The only way I can return what l owe to you and Ken is by fighting him. The next era is waiting for you. So you seem to understand what you're getting yourself into. Regardless, my era shall continue. Do you not agree, Rei? This era is rush ing towards its' end. You must die here, Ken-Oh. So be it. It seems we're destined to fight. Attack me any way you I ike. Get off your horse Ken-Oh ! Do you think you r measly power can throw me to the grou nd? No man in this world can draw my blood ! You'II eat those words in death ! It has been such a Long, Long Time Kanawanu yume o Long Long Time Since I locked these dreams in my heart Haato ni shimai konde I'm leaving on a journey On My Way Ima tabidatsu On My Way To never ending freedom... Kagirinakijiyuu e... I'Il never be able to turn back now Mou ni do to wa modore wa shinai Even if there 's no way to run from my sorrow... Kanashimino deguchi ga mitsukara nakute mo... Ah! Ah! Standing in the Heart of Darkness Ah! Ah! Give Me My Life, Give Me My Energy Ah! Ah! Fighting in the Heart of Madness Ah! Ah! Ease My pain, Ease My Loneliness Ken ! Hurry, come quick! Die for the sake of history, Rei ! Rei ! Ken ! Yuria ! So you've come, Kenshiro? Raoh, you bastard ! Rei ! Raoh ! The name "Raoh" is something l left behind long ago. Now I am Supreme Ruler of the New Century. A man of Iegend, Ken-Oh the Fist King ! Kenshiro, if you want to save Yuria, then defeat me! Wait, Kenshiro. Rei . Ken, if you fight him now, you'll die. Your styles are one and the same. If your fists clash now you may defeat him, but you'd die with him ! I have no regrets. I know l've fullfilled my destiny. But you must live on.
