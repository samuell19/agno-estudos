Hello? Oh, Satsuki? Why are you calling so late at night? What's so scary, huh? What a weird thing to say It'll be fine You have me, don't you? Go ahead and laugh You're just like my little sister Listening to your story reminded me of her Your little sis? Y'know, close by to our place There was this small lake Satsuki... Her name was Satsuki That Satsuki... She tried to steal that lake Steal a lake? Go ahead and laugh Because I was still in middle school... She would still have been in elementary I don't know why, but She kept trying take the lake using these buckets As if doing something like that... would ever make the waters recede She'd do weird things from time to time Hey... Can you remember the first music you heard when you were born? Can you? It was a lullaby Y'know, the sort of mom who would baptise a human with music She must have been... A diva, yeah? A mother's humming is the first music we encounter, huh A song to put her baby to sleep "Sleep, sleep, so gently" "Oh, so gently!" What if the song you hear the instant you die is a lullaby sung by someone else? That'd be sad No, it would be beautiful Either way No, it matters Hey I get tired of people, y'know That's fine That's right Satsuki's such a good girl Who's that again? My little sister Oh yeah? These days... She paints Who paints? Satsuki... Satsuki paints You can really see angels just by looking at this? You can I can't see anything It takes a while You've seen one? Maybe I should show you one An even more realistic one, maybe? I can hear your heart beat through your back Does that mean the sounds are in resonance? Don't think too much about it My little sister... she has a natural high You sure talk about your sis a lot It's 'cause looking at you... reminds me of her You calling me a woman? She was only close to me Although she's my cute little sister sometime's she so irritating She says when she listens to my heart, she can see whatever I'm thinking about "You were the one in the wrong!" She has such incredible passion You could've just had her watch TV She never watched TV, ever since she was little Kids are supposed to like TV, but she hates it Isn't that weird? No idea what you're talkin' about It's no good I don't want you to meet her It's February, right? That's not important This What're you doing? You're on the right I'm on the left How about spending the day handcuffed to each other? Hey!! Strong wind today, huh? What happened to the new one? It's a work in progress And its title? "The Pink Quagmire" You were thinking about old times, right? When me and you were still little kids Bingo Being walked off to the teacher You're sure something This really calms me down Hey, Satsuki Find someone besides me Find some else willing to lend you their chest I'm fine as long as I have you That's not it But, y'know If someone becomes my lover, it's not like they can cheat or anything Because you'd know right away? Yeah Want to talk about men? You have feelings for that guy? I hate him What does he do? He's a murderer Tell me about it Yes This is Yukimura Kindly leave a message Hey, Sis? It's Satsuki What's going on? It's strange that you've not been at home for three days Did you not get my messages? Sorry for calling back late I'm a bit worried now Please get back to me soon This has been Satsuki What do you intend to do? About what? This ain't some game Got no idea what you're talkin' about The woman, obviously! Why'd you have to go and blow it all up? I... Want to end this here Our relationship as father and son Nice to meet you. I'm Takatsuka I'm Kiyomi Yukimura's younger sister You can still make it To the crematorium I can get you there if we hurry I'm fine That sort of thing doesn't matter Not really grieving, are you We all react differently, yeah? You're doing your best Thank you This is what I'm into Strange, right? Much obliged Still haven't told your parents you came to Tokyo? Why was my sister killed? I would like to know the reason We're still in the investigative stage Do you have any suspects? If you do, please tell me I would like to meet them You should stop playing at detective So you're mocking me? When did you last see your sister? Last weekend Along with you parents? We live together So if you came to Tokyo today... you still haven't seen your sister's room You mean where she was murdered? Come on in How about some tea? Ah, I'll do it At my own discretion, since this someone else's house It's been left just as it was Ko sure is lucky It's for his cute, only son He'd do anything for him The boss was happy last time, yeah? About that woman dying? But I wonder how he intends to take care of it What is it now? Aren't you the stubborn one Didn't I say I'd told you all I knew? This is Kiyomi's younger sister What are you planning? She said she wanted to meet Kihara Don't fuck with me! The owner of this club and all the others we visited is Tatsumi Kihara, 45 years old His son is Ko Kihara Twenty four years old I said son, but the family register has it more like siblings Seems pretty complicated That guy, Ko Kihara... He's an orphan An orphan? Your face is always set to angry, huh Means you're an adult Did the orphan kill my older sister? There was a similar incident before The bathroom mirror was cracked and marked bloody Although we don't know if it was the same person or a copycat In the case of the last incident? The woman went missing And her body still hasn't been found Ko Kihara's mom is an interesting case She was a preacher in a religious group Tatsumi Kihara and his pops were amongst the group's adherents Now Ko, you see... When he was three... that overzealous preacher and a religious believer commited joint suicide 'Course I still have no idea how Kihara ended up looking after Ko What sort of religion? They say it's a religion that focused on angels Angels, yeah Angels! It's enough to make you laugh Here we are Looks like they're out Satisfied yet? I'll take you back The hotel your parents are staying at works, right? Do you know some other hotel? A cheap one? Why do you want to stay somewhere else? You could stay at my apartment Although it's not like I don't know a place Just tell me a place I can stay Underaged girl like you? No place will have you Welcome It's the younger sister Kiyomi's little sister? She came Here, of all places Why are you being so accommodating to Ko? I'm just an old man, see Don't take the hit for him anymore You surprised me Ko Kihara? I'm- The stars are out Sure are pretty I'm Kiyomi's- You're Kiyomi's what? Her friend She was an important person to me Was to me, too Kiyomi was... What is it? Kiyomi, y'know... I killed her I'm goin' in Wanna swap old memories? I'm begging you Don't abandon me Kiyomi? Who was that? So you came in here You came to take care of Kiyomi? Sorry What for? For killing the person you were coming to help You're not turning yourself in? Why do you ask? You're a killer, right? If the police were any good they'd be able to come after me themselves Do you not think about how much your victims' families suffer? I do, but y'know... So why did you kill her then? Talking with you just pisses me off Then I apologize for my sins That's all? I'll make it up to you by dying You a bit wrong in the head? Don't really care either way Whether I'm free or they kill me How old are you? Pretty sure I'm older than you Did you love Kiyomi? Yeah I loved her Then why do it? Stop using the standard logic It'll make things more difficult You're a spoiled child Kiyomi said the same thing Did you... really kill her? I sure did Excuse me I take issue with your actions Don't give me that shit There's no problem if I pay, yeah? I'm out of cash! Well this sucks How much is it? Shall we dance? Why do you leave the TV on? It's deadly serious Kiyomi taught me about it For example, if, like, if you can't fall asleep alone in your room You watch the TV like this, with nothing on Helps you get to sleep An even more realistic one, maybe? What is it? Did you really kill Koyomi? Was Koyomi... a good person? What're you talkin' about Of course she was What're you doing? You a thief? Don't go stealing stuff at a killer's house What're you looking for? A leather jacket A leather jacket with feathed wings attached on the back You hear about it from her?

Sure Ko, I'm gonna go grab the luggage I left I'll be right back! That's alright, yeah? We finally got some evidence Wanna hop in? Is this a threat?

The freebie's in the car Go ahead Got something planned? You get that all from my heart? Just had the feeling I'm full of jealousy! In the end, everyone... ...just acts on their own motives of profit and loss? I... ...always felt inferior to my younger sister Back then, I always wanted to get one up on her But, you know... Satsuki... Only in her presence... I didn't want to show her my negative side Ko... You can kill me Wasn't it always your childhood dream? Kill me I'll let you see it An angel appearing before you Ko... Just like people like my sister... I'm also... Falling for... What've you got there? Ko? Ko... You fooled me again, huh?

You took my older sister from me I can't forgive you Can't forgive my sister, either Or myself, for that matter Letting things go this far Doing things like this But I can't apologise to anyone What do you mean you can't forgive yourself? I'm going to get revenge against my sister, too How, though? I already know how I'm falling for you I don't understand it myself either At first...

To love in perpetuity; do you so vow? I do Ko Kihara... Ko Kihara, the murderer! Do you vow to love me? You're going to keep loving me forever, right?
