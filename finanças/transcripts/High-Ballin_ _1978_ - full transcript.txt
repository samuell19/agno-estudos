Cue, I don't know. Your guess is good as mine, son. But I'll tell you one thing, Duke is getting a little bit concerned. I don't know who's gonna be next, could be you, could be me. Yeah. Told them there's a grounded beaver on the side. By the time they got to him, he'd been ripped off and he was out colder than a January sailcat. Well, we can't panic. That's the one thing we can't do. We gotta stick together now, it's just that simple. Ain't nothing that simple anymore, Duke. Rane! Son! Where in the hell have you been keeping yourself? Oh, here and there, and getting my share. Yeah, your share and everyone else's. Oh, I keep the rust off. Hey, come on, let me buy you a cup a coffee. Okay. You know how long it's been since I laid eyes on you? Been a long time, huh? So long, it's... How about you, Decal? Yeah. Yeah, how about you? Hey, what's eating him? Same thing that's eating the rest of us. Says he's through as an independent. Says he's gonna sign up with King Caroll. We got a hijacking ring. They're picking us off one at a time, like flies. Sounds like you got some trouble. Son, you don't know the half of it. Yeah? Hey, you hike that any higher you're gonna have to braid it, gal. Harvey. Hiya, Dickens. Harvey. Hey, Duke, how you doing? Hello, Harvey. Hi. This bunch is slicker than a weasel's butt. Yeah, if smokey can't figure it out, what're we supposed to do? You can't trust nothing you hear on CB no more, that's for sure. Well, now, Bushes, the law's doing all it can do. Yeah, well, it ain't enough. Well, they put out a reward. My ass. Smokeys and reward. How many times do I have to tell you guys? The only ones the cops are gonna help are the trucking companies. There's no way they're gonna protect us independents. The day you junk runners get help from smokey is the day you get a retread cherry. Howdy, Pickup. What do you need, honey? Hmm. Well, what I need I can't get here. So, I'll have a can of soda and a piece of jerky. Right. Hey, Duke. What? Do you ever think about using some ordinance? A what? Pieces. Firearms, you know? Guns, jerks! No guns. No way for the gun. Forget the gun. Suit yourself. But just remember, when the independents were getting hijacked up north last year, the cops didn't give a sweet damn, and the trouble ended when the truckers took matters into their own hands. You know, for a peace loving socialist, you sure talk about your gun a lot, Harvey. Here, I'll get that one. Pickup, why don't you and me take the afternoon off, eh? Hmm? And do what? Now, you just leave all that to me. Hmm. I've already been to the zoo. Know something? What? You could work every day of your life, save up all your money, and on your last day, you wouldn't have enough to pay for my overtime. Hmm. Turkey. Maybe you ought to try sending her flowers by wire. Could help. That strikes you funny, does it? Yeah, kind of. Uh, Duke, who's your friend? He's one of them faggot bikers. You know what they call you? If you can't get a woman, get a clean, old man. Uh, do you mind if I ask you a personal question about them boots of yours? Reason I say personal is I never saw nobody but fags wear boots like that. They're serviceable. What do you call them boots anyway? I call the left one, May, and the right one, Alice. Well, now, you tell me, can you run in them boots? Like the wind, if I have to. Well, you have to. Unless you want me to shove those boots right up your ass. Of course, maybe you'd like that. Come on, Reggie, don't make any trouble in here. Harvey, will you cool this hot head off? He's a grown boy, Ma. Don't worry, Ma. I'll take him outside. God, I wish you wouldn't. Well, then run. Move it! You're not gonna cut me any slack at all, are you? How do you want it, sucker? Irons. Irons'll be just fine. Come on. This ought to be good, I wanna see it. Well, if we're gonna do it, might as well do the hell out of it. Come on, Reggie, let's go. You need two, do you? Two definitely works better. Sucker. Sucker. Hey! Why don't you just call it a day, tiger? Well, it looks like I owe you one. Uh, you all done? Yeah. Well, why don't we go to the house? Yeah. Be careful now. Okay, Duke. Learn to shoot that thing. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Get in, you monkey. Wake up, woman. She loves the horn. Well, we're home, son. Come on. Hey, Vonetta, look who I brought home! Hi, honey. Hi! Rane! Rane! Rane! How you doing? How you feeling, boy? Oh, better! Good to see you. Good to see you. Okay, come on in. Tanker! You learned how to ride a motorcycle yet, Tanker? Wheelies! But I'm not jumping like you yet. I bet your dentist would love to hear that. We love it here, Rane. Well, I can see why. It's beautiful here, Von. Rane, I bet you go everywhere. You've probably seen the whole world. Well, big pieces of it anyhow. Nothing nicer than you got here, Tank. Mmm. I've had it. I can't eat another bite. Mmm. Why don't we go work off some of Vonetta's, uh, lousy pie. Duke, you're not gonna really give up trucking, are you? Hey, what is this? What's with all the hard questions? I mean, you know, yeah, I think I will. Rane, I really think I will. Now that I'm older and tireder, ain't the same anymore. Ah, but shoot. That really ain't it. All this hijacking stuff. You know, it'll smooth. Oh, I know. I ain't worried about that, Rane. It's just I've pushed this rig too many years. I guess I'm tired, son. I've just had the lick. It ain't fun anymore. Well, then it's sure as hell time to quit. Hmm. How you fixed? Money? Aw, well, we're getting by, paying the bills. You know, doing all right. Besides, I'll make a couple more runs in this thing, and I'll sell it. Pay everything off. And I'll be square with the world. Well, it sounds like you've got it all clocked, Bubba. Yeah, think I have. Well, what about you, Rane? Hell, I don't know, Duke. I'm... I'm still looking. Hmm. Well, you know what you're looking for? Be a sight easier if I did. Hey, look, what you doing the next couple of weeks? Ah, nothing. I can't shake. Great! Son, I'll tell you what we'll do. You gonna take one more ride with the old Duke. Oh, no, wait a second. Nah, now wait a minute. I'll tell you what we'll do. We go out and we raise hell like we used to. You don't understand. Burn up some highway now. You don't understand. I come in here on two wheels and I'm gonna go out on two. No more of that 18 stuff for me. No more of this 18 stuff for you, huh? Absodamnlutely. Well, now, you better think about that 'cause the best I can remember, me and you used to have a good time. Now, that ain't it, now. Well, think about it, huh? One more time. Duke! Duke, get over here now! What the... Breaker 1-9, this is the Iron Duke, XFL-0929. What is it, hon? Damn, I lost them. Who? I was doing dishes and I heard someone using your handle on the box, calling in an emergency. Using my handle? Uh-huh. You sure? Uh, yeah. Well, who was it? What'd he say? Well, I didn't hear. When I tried to raise them, they died. Breaker 1-9. Breaker 1-9. This is the One Iron Duke, uh, any 18-wheelers out there ringing my phone, bring it back. Breaker 1-9. Breaker 1-9. Any of you 18-wheelers in range, bring it back to the One Iron Duke. Whoever it was is down or gone, huh? I don't know. Could be long gone. Babe, I'm gonna go. Okay. Bye. Hey, I'm coming, too. No, no, no. Now, you stay here with mama. But you promised! You said I could come next time. You promised. I know, Tanker, I know. But now listen. Some of my friends may be in trouble, hmm? And if they are, that ain't no place for a little boy. So you stay here and you watch after mama tonight. And we'll go tomorrow, all right? You promise? Yes, I promise. Watch out for mama. Bye, hon. Put out on nine, see if anybody answers it. This is the Iron Duke, XFO-0929. Put them down the incline. Come on. Okay. Pick it up. Let's go. Uh, break nine. Break nine. This is the Iron Duke, mobile, southbound on 181. Request information on any downed 18-wheelers with a Bullard 20. Come back. Roger, Iron Duke. We just had a 10-34 from Pictures, westbound out of Acker Falls, mile 289. Condition unknown. 289. That's a roger. Uh, that's a Roger. We're flying it and trying it on the side. Advise when you 10-23. We're here to help. Break 1-9. Break 1-9. How about you, Pictures? You've got the One Iron Duke. We're trying to get up there and copy me. Bring it back. Gravy Boat. For all you north-bounders, get this. We got raw weather coming in wall-to-wall and three top tall. Get back. Uh, forty rogers on that, Gravy. We got a bit of that weather coming our way, too. Thank you for the weather facts. Come back. I'm gone, Elton John. Iron Duke, clear on 1-9. There's the Marietta turnoff. It's a half-mile to the cut. Well, we're close. Hang in there, Pictures. Hang in. Charlie-Four at 289 and cruising. Uh, no sign of them. Charlie-Four, this is Six. We got the sight spotted, but it's vacant. Damn, they've hit him. They've already hit him. Ah, hell of a night to be looking for somebody in the snow. Well, why don't you go over there and I'll start down here at the bottom. Okay. Damn, it's cold! See anything over there? I think this is a waste a time. Gotta be down here. See anything over there, Luke? Evening, Jimmy. Hi, Duke. Rough night, huh? Well, did you fellas see anything? Uh-uh. Must've cleared out and gone. What about Pictures? Is he okay? Hard to say. We haven't found him. Hey, Jim! Come on. They found him. Over here. Is he dead? Nope. But he's hurt bad. Jimmy. Yeah? Let's get him out of the snow. Get a stretcher, please. Right. God, look at him, Rane. Come on, Duke. Let's go. Pictures' probably dead. God, why didn't we get to there sooner? Duke, we got there as soon as we could. Well... Duke. See, Duke, I gotta tell you something. Whoever did this knew you were out of action tonight. They knew your handle and they used it. Don't you see? They know you truckers here inside out. Look, I'm drunk. I'm drunk. Had enough of it, right? It's time to put it to bed. Yeah, we'll get them son of bitches. Right? Duke, I'm gonna stick with you, huh? Mmm-hmm. I'm sticking with you. I'm gonna help you. And now I'm gonna take you home, huh? No. Yeah. I'm gonna drive you. No, no, no. Yeah. We clear out of this place. No. Oh, oh. Here. Here you go. Come on. I'll just sleep in the truck. I'm... I'm okay. Yeah. Yeah. I wanna sleep in the truck. You're perfect. You're just fine. I'll be out there in a second. I'll tuck you in, huh? Yeah. You again, eh? Uh, beg your pardon, miss? Come on. You remember me. Well, um... I don't guess so. But, uh... I sure remember you. Right. Oh. The hotshot with the iron. Very nice. Very nice. Phew. You stuck around for that one, huh? Yeah. I stuck around. I wanted to make sure that creep didn't follow me. No. No, he... He went home. Or somewhere. Sure as hell lost interest in you in a big hurry. What're you doing here? Getting drunk. A friend of ours got hit. I know. Hijacked. I know. I relayed his 20 to the bears. You did? Mmm. Well, what are you, a trucker? Well, I ain't no go-go dancer. Hmm. Hey, look. Your buddy's gonna be okay. I checked it out with the medics. Oh, uh, that was very nice of you. Uh... I mean, I'm glad to hear that. Uh... Look, I don't wanna be rude, but what do you say we blow this pop stand, and go dancing, have a couple of beers? Well, I was just thinking that maybe... Nobody thinks for me but me, my friend. If I want you, you'll know about it. Yeah, well, uh, how will I know about it? When you want me? If I want you. Catch me on the radidio, baby. Later. Dukey? Huh? Need some help? No. Your head hurt you? Yes. Got a hangover, honey? Why'd you let me get so drunk last night? Well, honey, it's like you always say, it's your mouth, you can all close it if you want to. Aw... You're looking bad in your clothes now there, kid. Well, I'm feeling bad in my clothes. Let me help you along here. Duke. Cue, what the hell are you doing? Shoveling snow. I can see you're shoveling snow, but what're you shoveling snow for? Sold my rig. Working for Caroll now. Hijacking, Duke. I'm scared. Hey, Bud, how about loading my truck for me? Uh, Bud? Oh. You talking to me? Yeah, I think I'm talking to you. Well, now, Duke, just wait a minute. I think you're forgetting something here. I got a few priorities of my own, and one is to drink a cup a coffee. Bud, if you keep jacking me around and jacking me around, I'm gonna mash your head. You better watch your mouth. Hey. Hey, now. Well, I'm... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Now, you boys here got a little ring-a-ding going, or what? No, I'm just trying to get your monkey here out of his tree to load my truck. He come in here giving orders. Well, can I, uh, get you boys a cup a coffee? Eh? Uh, no. Thank you very much. Uh, I've had mine. Where are you boys bound for? Uh, Green Bay. Green Bay. Hey, a hell of a town. My, you gotta be careful. Look out for them hookers and hijackers. You gotta keep your eyes peeled. We've got eyes. Yeah, you need it. Boy, that's a sin what's going on. Mad dog loonies out there. By the way, did you get the permit I need? Oh, by golly, no, I didn't have time. I mean, them deals take two, three days to clear. Oh, so it'll take an extra 100 and a half, too, don't it? Look, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You boys get jumped and I'll pay the fine. Now, how's that? Oh, that's real handsome. Of course, you independents, if you had some real good sense, you'd be working for old King Caroll. You've got a standing offer here. Good bucks. Security. Anytime you wanna sign. Well, thank you. Appreciate that, Mr. Caroll. But I've been on my own so long, I... I just like it better that way. Oh, you're bucking the trend, Duke. Yeah. Well, I'm just ornery. There you go. You just check out and you're on your way. And good luck, hmm? Thank you. See you. All right. You boys come back now when you're ready for another one. Hey, King Caroll needs your business, you hear? Whoa. Whoa. What is that extra $50? What is that? Oh, that. That's for a hurry up on the load. You take that extra 50 and you stick it up where the sun don't shine. And if I wasn't in such a hurry, I'd stick around and assist you. Hmm! Well, a $150 to load it. $50 for the dispatcher. Ain't no wonder Caroll's ready to get my tickets. Really? Well, you paying for the ranch, Bubba? Well, yeah, at least we're doing that. Well, then I'm happy. Do it to it. We're gone. Be good, you hear? See you, Ma. Hey, there, Tanker. Come on, mister. Hey, Rane. Come on up here. How you doing? Gee. Don't get the mud all over everything, Tanker. Hey, Rane.

You know, I've been thinking... I'm thinking that maybe... Maybe we ought to back off a little bit. What are you talking? Well, I might quit, that's what I'm talking about. I don't believe you. Listen, son, it ain't like it used to be no more, you know? I got obligations now and I got a wife. I got a kid. I can't go up and down a road being shot at. So, I'll go to work for Caroll. Big deal. So what? Just means I won't get the farm paid off as quick. But I will get a payday every week. Hmm. Is that what it is? Rane! We could've been killed out there, son. Well, it ain't like you, Duke, to go sweating your ass off for somebody else. Never was, you know? Okay. So I ain't so proud no more. Well, I believe that. Son, what am I supposed to do? Huh? I'm busted. I'm broke. Well, I could always sell my fair, white body. Y'all will be rich. Will you please give us a break? You got a better idea? Yeah. What? Roll a high one.

How about those boys up at the lumber camp? Lac Larouge. They're always thirsty. And we make a good run and get 10,000. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. A year. Barring the smokeys. Oh, come on. Barring accidents. Early winter. And if you kids think Slater is Santa Claus, then you got another think coming. We gotta have $6,000 to get a load. Now, where we gonna get $6,000. Huh? Well, I'll flog my bike for a grand. Would you do that? Sure. And that leaves us short of five big ones. Or we could always paper your powder blue pickup. Oh, oh, hold it. Hold it. Are you two serious? Yeah. Yeah. All right, then I'll tell you what we'll do. There's a mortgage on the house. I'll just sign it over. And Duke will pay the $6,000. How's that? Geez, Duke. That's a triple threat without insurance. You sure you wanna run it? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I wanna run it. 'Cause you gonna help me, right? Right. So, let's go and see Slater. All right. Pick up some booze. You got it. Well? Well, you just sit tight. Oh, no. I'm coming in. Not a chance. Well, look here, I'm part of this deal. No, you're not, and no, you can't.

I happen to be a truck-driving man. So... What did she say? Man. Man? Man. Man? Oh, give me a break. You know, you guys, you know what really bugs me? Is that I've saved your asses twice now and I don't want thanks, I don't want nothing from you. But I wish you had the guts just to admit it and let me help you. 'Cause I wouldn't be here, you know? Except that I like you Hmm. She said that to you. I'm a married man, she didn't say that to me. Now wait, uh, do you think you'd be all up in the morning? Duke... 7:00, okay? She... Goodnight. Now what'd you have to do that for? Nice guy like that. You know, you're slow. You're really slow. Why didn't you just ask me to dance? Oh, right. Let's dance. All right! ♪ And he thinks of the good things ♪ In our world ♪ Our world's not made of ♪ Big clouds and rainbows ♪ And roses don't grow all around ♪ But when he holds me ♪ Hello ♪ All the honey flows ♪ And I'm glad ♪ That he's back in our world ♪ Later on in his day ♪ He takes time to call me ♪ Just to find out ♪ If things are going right ♪ And through his busy day ♪ I know he can't wait ♪ To walk through... ♪ Hey, do you want to dance? No. Wait a minute. Hey, man. Hey! Come on, man. Come on, there. Rane, behind you! Hi. Thank you, very much. Come on. Well, you were all right back there, you know? Why is it every time I meet you, somebody tries to start a fight with me? Uh, keep low my friend, they'll never take us alive. Hurry up! We can't let them get too far ahead of us. I wanna see where he's going. Speaking about keeping low. Mmm? Pull over the first chance you get. What? Right here? Yeah. Okay, look. There's a motel right there. Right down the street. I want you to go up there, get a cabin, and get in and stay there till I come. Okay? Well, um... Why don't you just come with me now? Will you just do it? Please? Now. I'll make it all up to you. All right! Oh, God! Oh! Oh! God, you're paranoid. Well, we're even on that one. ♪ You, you are the best thing in my life ♪ You, you and me together ♪ I want to feel you there beside me ♪ Take my hand and carry on Mmm. ♪ You, you and me together ♪ Hold me. Go slow. Oh, yeah! Mmm. No party tonight, huh? I've had all the partying I need. They give you quite a run, did they? Think that's funny, Caroll? Oh, come on, Harvey. That ain't my end of things. I'm just a businessman. We're partners, King. When I got a problem, you got a problem, and right now you got a problem. No, that hijacked car's all taken care of. It's being cut up into little pieces. Nobody ever gonna see that thing again. It's not the Fury I'm worried about. It's that cowboy. Ah, he's got nothing. Never even seen your face nor the others. He's not like the rest of them, King. That's one you ain't gonna see running with his tail between his legs. Now, it only takes one guy to start fighting back to make the others stick it out. There's only way to deal with a dude like that. Now you listen to me. I want them independents out of business. I want them busted. But there's some kinds of hardball that I won't play. There's only one way to play hardball, King. Only one way I know, anyhow, and that's down and dirty, winner takes all. Break 1-9. Hey, uh, how's the stuff coming through? Okay. I'm gonna give it to you on this one then I'm gonna switch sets. One, two, three, four. Three, two, one. That ends up here. Charlie. What's the matter, Daddy? Tanker, what you doing out of that bed, boy? Well, I heard you walking, I couldn't sleep. Hmm? I wanna ask you if I could go with you? Oh, Tanker, Tanker, Tanker. Listen. You're old man ain't too proud of what he gotta do. If I were to take you with me somewhere and having you or the old man die... No, son, you can't go. But I'm big enough. I can help you. Yeah, you probably are. You probably are. And I'll tell you what I'm big enough to do. I'm big enough to whip your little butt if you don't get back up into bed soon, okay? I got a call from that little weasel, Slater, this afternoon. Told me that a friend of yours got a hot sauce run lined up for tomorrow. Duke? Running booze? Yeah, that's right. Now, does that tell you anything? 'Cause it tells me that he's hurting. You hurt him today. No need for any killing. We just gotta squeeze him a little. He's gonna fold and go under. When he does, the rest will just fall into line. That still leaves the cowboy. Ah, that cowboy will drift on. Now, why do I doubt that? What is it with you? You got something personal going against this dude? He owes me one. Besides, like you say, King, business is business. And I seem to recall that half of it's still mine. But I still call the shots, and don't you forget it. I don't King. That's one thing I never forget. Rane. No. I am experiencing a sudden loss in cabin pressure. Go back to sleep. I'm wide awake. I want a cigarette. I find it quite a revitalizing experience, you know? Rane, there's something I've gotta tell you. Hmm. You love me. Now turn out the light and come back to bed. Um... You know those men you were worried about following us? Mmm-hmm? Well, there are two men right outside here, right now. What? And they got machine guns, babe. Oh, terrific. This is us getting hit. Where's your magnum? In the truck, of course. Oh, sensational. Window. Get the door. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Who are these guys anyway? Come on. You turkey vultures! Oh, I'm gonna get you. Jesus! Those guys have got no right. They have got no right. They should be arrested. They're just jealous, honey. Huh! It figures. King Caroll. Where's your heater? Hmm? Your gun, woman! Ah, terrific. And you might need these. You know what we're gonna do? What? No, I'm going inside and you stay here and stay sharp. If anything heavy comes down, you hit the horn, then hit the bricks. And get the cops. Okay? Mmm-hmm. Rane, if you get hurt I'm gonna kill you. Terrific. What? Who? Well, well, don't give me any maybes, is he inside or isn't he? But I don't give a hot start what Buck said. Is Harvey there? Well, yeah, tell him to take over till I get there. I'm coming right down. ♪ I know where I'm going ♪ And know who's going with me ♪ ♪ I have shoes of silver ♪ And shoes of dark green leather♪ ♪ And shoes of bright green leather ♪ Ribbons to tie my... ♪ Hmm. God damn it. Let's go over here and see what's going on over here. Vehicle's not supposed to be here. ♪ I know where I'm going ♪ And I know who's going with me ♪ You're looking for trouble, honey? No, I was just, uh... Get up. Watch it. Let me go. Get her legs. Come on now. All right, come on, move it. Close those damn doors. Two guys go around there, one guy there. It's probably that cowboy. Keep your eyes open. You guys come with me. Someone's taken out the damn power. It came from in there. It's that bloody cowboy, he's gonna ram us. Get your ass out of here. Watch the gate. I'm going over here. Okay, spread out. You two, over there. Leave me... Shut up! Hell, can't two of you handle one little girl? Mother... Jesus, get her hogtied, will you? Well, where is he? Well, he got away. Now, listen, make sure she doesn't get away. She's our only insurance. And where you going? They gotta make that run or Duke goes under, right? Just what do you intend to do about that? I'm gonna take their heads off, King. What do you think I'm gonna do about it? Lose your own head, more like, boy. Let me handle this. You've handled us into this, King. Now why don't you just sit on your fat ass and keep an eye on our bargaining power. You're walking right into it, boy. You. Ah, you're gonna be so sorry. Oh, shut up! Looks like your buddy didn't show, huh? Mmm-mmm. Looks like my buddy didn't show. You got the mortgage? Yup. Got the mortgage. Fair weather friends. Well, look at it this way, you don't have to split the take. See you, Slater. Slater! Slater! Where's Duke? What? Where's Boykin? Tell me! Christ, he took off. He's 20 miles out by now! Look, Slater, if you had anything to do with this, I'm gonna come back here, I'm gonna kick your ass, man. I'm taking that truck. Hey! You. I'm clean! I'm clean! What in the... Harvey? Where's your friend, Duke? I said, where's your friend? He's not here. Why don't you turn around and face me, Duke? I said, turn around. Oh. This is the Ranemaker for the One Iron Duke. Give me a shout back, Duke. Come on, man. Iron Duke, this is the Ranemaker. You give me a shout back there, buddy. Iron Duke, this is the undercover lovers. You've gotta give me a song. Come on, sing it back to me. Uh, this the Ranemaker. The Ranemaker. On the shout for the Iron Duke. Come on, Duke. Come on back. Duke. Duke! Duke. Duke, you stay with me. Duke. I gotcha now, huh? It's Rane, Duke. I got you. You stay with me, huh? Break 1-9. Break 1-9. This is the Iron Duke for an emergency relay. I need a doctor and an ambulance at Duke Boykin's farm. I've got a man who's dying. Vonetta, Duke's been hurt. What happened? How bad? Real bad. He's been shot. Oh, my God! Oh, wait for me, have to get my baby. Tanker, climb off that rig, I gotta move it. Who shot my dad? Harvey! One of King Caroll's men. I'm on my way to nail his ass. A break 1-9 for the King Caroll base station. You copy, Caroll? Yeah, go ahead, breaker. You got Caroll base. You just ain't kidding, Caroll. I got you all the way around. Identify yourself, breaker. You know who this is. Your crazy just shot my best friend, Caroll. I'm coming in after you. Mom, they'll kill him if he goes alone. You're coming with me to the hospital. Tanker! I'm going to get help for Rane. Let's talk about a trade. You got nothing I want, except maybe your life. You wanna talk about that? Ma, Pa's been shot. Rane's going to King Caroll's to get the hijackers who did it. You've gotta help me, please! Okay. Skid, Bushes. Come on. We gotta go. Let's go. Rane, you got Spud Ranger on the box. We're with you. That's Ma's story. We're on our way, too. Big Red down and rolling. This is the Bruiser-cruiser, Rane. You got support on the way. Uh, breaker 1-9. Sundown on the shout. Rane, what's your 20? Come back. Yeah, 4 Sundown. My 20's three miles outside a Caroll's. I'm going in. I'm going hunting. What's the story, Rane? I hear they got Duke down. Uh, yeah, that's a roger, breaker. And it was Harvey gunned him down. But Caroll's behind it. where is she, King? Now, listen, you. There's 40 truckers on the way here! Now you harm that girl and they're gonna lynch us. You just cool it! So what's your plan, King? We supposed to go out there with our hands in the air? Just give ourselves up? Is that it? That's the only thing we can do. I'm the... You. Sit there! This is Sledgehammer on the shelf, we’re joining the revolution. Fifth Wheel going by here. Go to it, Sledge, and God bless you. They've had you all set up from the get-go. We busted them and Duke had to pay for it. We're with you, Rane. Hold on. The troops is on the way. Yeah. That's a big 4-10 all the way around. So what were you gonna do, King, hmm? You were gonna trade me for her, were you? What were you gonna do? Con yourself out of getting busted? All right. You! This is the Black Devil. We're right behind you in the black 18-wheeler cab to go. Where is she? She's in there. You... Son of a... Harvey, you... Stay cool, you bitch, or you're gonna be in trouble. Get your hands off the wheel! What about the one you owe me, Ranemaker? That's between us. Let her go, Harvey. Suppose I do? Then what? Well, then it's just you or me. Double or nothing. You call it. Okay, hero. What's it gonna be? Well, look at it this way. One of us ends up owing nothing. Well, by the time you heal up, I'll be ready to do a little truck show. Well, I will, too, son. Hey, you really gotta go? Well, then go on! Go! Get on down the road! Y'all take care! Oh, we'll be good. I don't know about old lawless here, but... Hey, I'll see you, Von. Bye. Take care. Well, Tank. There's the key. You take real good care of it, huh? But I don't want you try to start it till you can pick it up by yourself. Hey, Rane. Come back sometime when you can, okay?
