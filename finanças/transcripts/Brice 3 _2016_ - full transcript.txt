Back then, I was... the greatest surfer ever. Lord of the board. On a first-name basis. with the world's biggest waves. Jaws. Belharra. Nazare. Mavericks. Those waves are legends now. But I saw them all bow down before me and die at my feet. I'd lost all hope of ever finding a worthy adversary. until Fate confronted me with a new and unexpected challenge. Mountains. Hey, what's waxing? Lord of the Board. No one had ever sped past me. Who are you? Brice... Brice de Nice. It was me. I was going so fast... I sped past myself. Is that for real? It's physically impossible. Wrong. It happens every 50 years, like comets. One more story! Story time is over. School's out. Come on, please, Brice! I told you all my stories. A true story, for once. A true story? So let me tell you about... the great adventure of my life. Hey, Bodhi. Brice-ket. Breeze de Nice surfer scent. Cotton swags Tee-shurts Sweet pants ...and you bust, and you bust... Every morning I bust air, like a prayer to self-prepare. What's waxing, Edwige? Just waxing along. FIST OF NICE "ME" GAME BRICEY BEAR Yellow Jello? No thanks. I moved things around. The Mona Lisa wasn't there. Mono Liso. - I put Dad there. - In a cage? Because he's in jail. And here, a mirror of me. French World Championship Bust-off What are you looking at? I loved that bust-off because I really humiliated him. Good times... I'll throw Yellows again. - Your parties? - Totally. Brice, don't you think maybe it's time to move on? Years have gone by. You've aged a bit. At some point we all have to... Don't sit. I invited you, but not for long. Yeah, that's better. If I were you, I'd find myself an odd job. What's that? What's wrong? Water in your ears? No, but I hear nothing but crap. My bust-chi class. Stretch out your arm. Point from north-west to south-east. Avoiding Taiwan. - Chinese version? - No, Nice cheese. And you bust and you bust... Double bust! The sneaky baby bust. Finally, finger bust. Take one of me and Piss Hair man. Only yellow coins. He says no to bills! It was worth coming to see this dummy. I heard it, but with a tiger. Thanks a lot. Great, I don't have this one. Thank you... Goodbye! Bodhi... The other propeller here. This way it'll fly. Vaya con dios. He won't be back. Night, Fabrice. Say, "Papa". I love you, my sonfish. While the sky pulled its starry cloak over the Bay of Angels. no one could have imagined that this night, so seemingly peaceful, would be the last one I spend in my home. Hay, Brisse. Itz me, yur bessst frend. Marius! Majer trubble, Hellp! Come as kwik as u can. Take the furst plain. Shit... I haven't eaten. Busta-burger. Majer trubble. Hellp, Brisse. Hellp! I think it's better. "I can't come "bicause I don't "feal like it." My best friend is me. You don't leave home for a second best friend. His problem is his. The monster. Brice Bertrand Agostini? "Bertrand" is too embarrassing. As we said in our letters, the regional council, in accordance with article C133 for the preservation of the seacoast has decided to rid the beach of debris that pollute it. Understand? What? We're cleaning up. What for? The new administration is cleaning the city. Building facades, parks, monuments. Yes, I saw statues in Nice. Massena, Queen Victoria, de Gaulle... Shut up. Can I get a statue of me as well, in Nice? Statues are for people of historical importance. Yeah, that's why. Listen, I don't know how to tell you... You're being evicted. I have to cut you off. It'll be complicated because I live here. It's my home. I say this with Fabrice as my witness, I'm famice. Famous in Nice. Well, starting today you're dismissed. Excuse me. Dismissed from Nice! Exactly. You must swim with your own wings now. The salt stings your eyes but you'll get used to it. Go, Fabrice... go. Mama... Take care of your grandsonfish. Things aren't waxing too well. Bodhi? Hi, Brice. See how they busted my home? I saw, but... nothing better could happen to you. No, I could have kept it. You act like the king of glide and bust. - “Glust”. - You must take my advice. It is time to sacrifice this artifice. I don't understand. You don't? Not all of it. So think. What does "think" mean? Bodhi, what does "think" mean? "Come kwik. "Take the furst plain." First plane, please. First plane for where? I don't know. The first plane tomorrow is for Bordeaux at 6:55. Okay, I'll take it. Wait! Wait! Wait! Goddamn! Are you okay? And are you okay? Enjoying your flight? Loser. Natasha? Yes? Can I drive the plane? Excuse me? You're excused. Can I drive? - No, sir. - Why not? That's the pilot's job. Okay, I see. I get it... He doesn't share his toys. Don't pull my hair! TUUUUUUUUBE! Impossible! At that height it's -50 degrees. Yes, but I had a pullover. PUUUUUUUULLOVER! - Load of crap! - What? They're not car windows! Yes, but... there was a secret button. - Yes, I know it. - See? She said she knows the secret button. - Everything would be sucked out. - Depressurization. Okay, I didn't surf on the wing. But I did surf. There they are. The line's here! But the taxis are there. - Where are you going? - Marius'. Sure, get in. You've got some nerve! Thanks. I'll be back. Pay up. You okay? Really? Here. - What the hell? - Hey. Hello. I'm here for Marius. Marius? He's dead. He's dead? Yeah. Yes. But where will I sleep? Did you know him well? My best friend. He sent me a bottle yesterday. Marius died 15 years ago. No, I met him 10 years ago. Not the same Marius. Ah yes. 10 years, 15 years. Think. Second time I've heard that. "Think". I don't know if you've ever had to think, kids, but be careful. You mustn't do it too often. It can be totally dangerous. Think. Please. There's nothing. Good news. No, there's nothing. in your head. What's that little spot? Your brain. I mean, the active part, which is about... 7% of it. Not bad. The rest is. How can I put it? It's like... Rice pudding, sort of. That's right. I'd never seen 7% before. To give you an idea, a boar is four. And ticks are six. Is someone coming for you? No, I came for someone. - Who? - Marius de Frejus, my friend. A child? No, why? The mistakes. - There are mistakes? - Everywhere. Or it's in code. The answer was there! Right under my eyes. Marius had coded his message so only I could decipher it. Be fair, don't stare. I'm rare. Igor d'Hossegor. Ignoble, infamous, cruel Igor. My sworn enemy had Marius in his grip. To see my friend alive, I had to get going without a second to spare! - Where to? - Hossegor. Me too. Get in. - Come on. - I can find better. Really? TUUUUUUBE! Okay... so long. Behind that dune you'll find the surfer beach. Thanks a lot. Making fun of me? Just of your voice. Know where Igor is? You're clueless. Fat ass! Know where Igor is? - Prick! - No, Igor. Yo, beachies, what's waxing? How's the swell? Gnarly? Not from here? No, I'm from Nice. You mean from the 90s? I know that wave! I already took it. How can I put it? Girls... Try not to stare. When I'm gone, you'll miss me. You'll be lonesome. It'll be hard. Don't get hooked. Never question yourself? Don't think that. Being a hunk is hard. I wish it on no one. Real ordeal. Mind if I take your pic? Mind if I don't take yours? Poster of me. Do God. Apollo. Got any sunny cream for here? And for here? You're not that great either! This is a real shark tooth made of resin. Who's he? He's hitting on you? Relax, Greg. You can see he's a jackass. I'm here. I can hear you. Oh yeah? Lower your eyes. Listen up, pompom boy. This isn't your spot. It's Gregor d'Hossegor's. Know him? Got Google? Shit your pants before I do it for you. Play with your pail and your wiener before I kill you. I get it. Pure evil. With your retarded spaniel face. Save some for your mom. Know where Igor is? You want Igor? Lay off, Unibrow. I want the boss. You should never do this. Did you see my face? I'd use it for Halloween. How dare you? How dare you speak like that? Leash him. Cool, a leashing! What's a leashing? Violence is okay! We're on vacay! Faster! This is boring. I'll show you. Beat it. Never come back. Igor? Where is Marius? No violence. It hurts. Where's Marius? Never heard of him. Be fair, don't stare. I'm working. Or they'll hit me and make me eat sand. then pull apart my toes. They'll tell my mommy, then no dessert. You've become a weakling. You've become a... Weakling! Igor d'Hossegor had become a... Weakling! That's not true. How pathetic! A weakling! He'd become the beach slave! I'm the new maintenance manager of Gregor d'Hossegor's beach. in charge of material for boarding... 1-800-WEAKLING which I polish. You got leashed. Yeah. Slave! is my board ready? Right away, Shark. You didn't kidnap Marius. Nice and pretty. Clean as a whistle. Idiot. I don't get it. Why is your name... here? There's also "yoyo", "donut"... I said beat it, Piss Top. - Gregor, I adore each pore! - Beat it. What's this? "Hey, Brisse..." "It's here. "Hawaii." You didn't turn it around? I didn't think to. Be careful with cards. There can be two sides. Later. Too late. You're not leaving. You shouldn't have done that. Really? What will you do? It's time for... a duel! Dento-spiral, dento-fusion, dento-tooth! Gregor... raptor! Yellow force! Bus... Panta-chute! Electric zipper! Nip-pull... Nipple pull. Busted. Violence not okay on vacay. Don't attack, have a snack. You got it all wrong! I busted you, Brice de Nice. - Marius? - Help! It's serious! I can't lose here. I have to save my friend! Be nice, Brice. Gregor no more! Finish him. Vaya con dios. I'll butt your raptor head. You're just a thug. Little brat with your dumb hat! Can I say something? You can't become a robot. Yes, if you're angry. It's impossible! You're talking nonsense. So transform yourself. But I'm not angry now. Yeah, right! Whatever! Okay then! Here's what really happened. Dento-fusion, dento-spiral, dento-tooth! You calm now? Yes. You fixed it? Yeah. Hawaii is my lifelong dream. Because deep down, I know I'm... Fat? A lizard. Is it real? No, it's just a tattoo. Yeah, I know... I meant your bellybutton. This lizard... is a Hawaiian gecko. This is no coincidence. You have to take me. Take me. I won't travel with my enemy. I'm not your enemy anymore. If you take me to Hawaii, maybe even... I could be your friend. It won't be perfect at first. because you'd be my first friend. You'd just have to teach me. Because in fact... I was never nice to people because... I don't know how else to be. A scared, barking dog. So scared not to be loved, I never loved. When I see how you help Marius, I realize I've wasted the best years of my life. If only you knew, Brice... I have so much friendship to give. All right. You're taking me? I'm taking you. If you eat that jellyfish. Or else not. But that has nothing to do with it. - So no. - How come? If you eat the jellyfish. I'll take you, be your friend, if you eat it, or else not. You have to eat everything. Everything? If you don't eat it... Why? Who decided this? Are you discussing? - Not me. - I didn't. - No, then. - I asked a question. Any good? It stings... I was evil. That's how it was then. We didn't think twice. We didn't know back then. It wasn't an issue. That's the way things worked. Believe it or not. he ate the jellyfish and a fistful of sand. Or you can't come. He was weak, a weakling. Nice but weak. Gregor... raptor! Now. But how? Let's go. Come! Those morons took the jet-ski! Where can they go? Hawaii? Hawaii or bust! The fiery, sharp rays of the sun burnt our skin. already gnawed at by salt crystals. We were dammed to die a slow death, when suddenly! What do we got? Tuna, swordfish, tires, 2 surfers, banjo, TV. And a scorpion fish. - Hi, what's waxing? - Why are you here? Got dismiced. Bottle led to a plane, but Marius died. Igor ate a jellyfish, we left for Hawaii... By jet-ski. Okay. - And you? - We fish. - For? - Endangered species. - How cool. - Very. Lucrative too! What are you doing? - Why? - It hurts. It's just a fish. He's endangering it. No, he's killing it. - It'll die. - It's free to choose. Lucrative too! - Stop it! - Stop what? Let the shark go free He didn't harm you or me Poor thing wants only... A little liberty Let the shark go free Poor little fishy His home's the deep blue sea You catch lots of crap Then throw it in the water And it's the animals you slaughter If you changed your tack Junkmen you would be And happiness would rule the sea! Happiness rule the sea! Let them all swim free Let's start recycling stuff Recycling is enough Having fun and living rough! Let them swim free It's where they want to be No more debris in the sea! So long! Bye-bye! Bye-bye, friends! They really are nice guys. Arriving on that mysterious island, I was stepping into a world that I never could have imagined. Marius! Nice place, isn't it? I don't find it scary at all. Not at all. We saw you. Yeah, we saw you. Wait, wait! Wait, Brice. If we don't make it, I have something to tell you. I lied. You were right. My bellybutton... isn't a real one. A bellybutton sticker. You have no bellybutton? I do. Under my nipple sticker. A uni-nipple. Body part stickers don't exist. Can you shut up? This four-eyed bitch is a damned pain! She keeps butting in. Pain in the ass! What do you know? I have a tooth sticker. You'll see later on, when you have no teeth. So? Can I continue? Can I continue? Go on. Ride it... - Marius! - Brice! Stop! It's annoying. Not my thing. You got my bottle. "Trice"... I also did a tattoo of my name. I didn't screw up. I did it right-side up. If ever I forget who I am... I read: "Mariusse". It's not as good. Your head's hairy. Never oppose what grows. So you kept them. And I don't hide them anymore. Thanks to them. I saw the world. In-toe-viewer in Equator. Toe-nnis in Tunis. Pia-toe in Rio. Then I came to twiddle my toes in Hawaii. I'm so happy to pee you! He's our savior! Our savior. - Our savior - I'm your savior! That's a sacred tree. Saved them from what? I busted it. Brice... Moana. Moana is the chief of the... Bearded thongs. He's the chief of the Moa... Moas... of the tribe. So you're not in danger. In danger? Yeah, you said "Help". No, I'm not in-dangered. You're in-dangered! It's why I sent the bottle. Follow me. You'll see. Go on, go on! Bust before entering Members only! Braïce, is that you? Yeah. Why are you here? I didn't recognize you. Sorry, I didn't expect you. Shut up. Come on... - Who are you? - Marius Quail like the bird. Smells like the end. I know... Chin-ups because it's gonna be a shock. What's waxing, Braïce? - All good. - Welcome home. Aloha. Abracada-Braïce! Totally. A statue of me... Oh my Bodh. Bustage. You look great, man. HIGHLIGHTAGE Braïce-ket! A village... of me. They stole everything from you. LOAFAGE Braïce! I can't believe you're here. She dated me on the mouth. Look! SHOWOFFAGE Lots of swell. - Your pals prefer the forest? - They have no choice. Evicted from their village. Evictage. Their entire village was destroyed to build this water spark. Good idea. It's much better. They'll do it to the whole island. Big yellow theme park. The tribe is going bust. Yes, robust. SCOPAGE - How's the swell? - Gnarly. Braïce! Can I ask you a question? You just did. Braïce busted me! Braïce... check! Check... check out! Can you see this is a stroke-screen? The bar where it is that they drink used to be the school. They thought of everything! Braïce-cream! Look! This is amazing! Huge! Caram-Brice, Bubble-Brice, Brice Cheese! Busted Bars, awesome! - It costs for free? - For you, yes. This... What the hell? Don't you see they steeled from you too. Anyone home? You don't get it? I get it. You're jealous. You want a you park, not a me park. You're jealous! - I am not. - You are You're jealous. Wear shoes or bury your feet. I don't know him! I forgot what an ass you are. Have fun with yourself. That way, yeah... Beat it. This is paradise. Braïce paradise! COMING SOON!!! At least when you're that ugly, no lookalikes! Let's make a date so I can cancel! Can we take a selfie? Sure, but alone. Sign our guestbook. Want a glass? I'd love one. You can bust off. "Bravo for the Me Theem Parc. I congratoolate myself." Come on! Go on, Braïce. I'm here. It's not him. It's not him! What? It's not him. I'm here. What's waxing? It's me. Give me a Y. Give me an E. Give me an L. Give me another L. Give me an O... Hey you! Dance! Dance! Dance! Busted! That's not busting. Busted! Sorry to bother you but this is total nonsense. First of all, busting isn't this. It's this. NW to SE, without touching Corsica. Who are you to stop my yellow? Brice. Brice de Nice. Surfer, winner, ascendant, snowboarder. Lord of the board, king of bust. The only thing you're busting is the atmosphere. Can't hear. You don't exist. The one Brice is from Nice: me. The one Braïce is from... Hawaiïce! It happens here. Sign up on Braïceparadise.bust Remember me? Not at all. You never let me into your Yellows. You. yes... you, yes. You... no. Yeah. Okay, I get it. You're fans. Are you together? Just you. Sorry, darling. I prefer. The dog, yes. Just the dog. My Kiki... Fuck! - Fuck what? - That face. What about it? It's ugly as shit! Beat it. Why won't you let me in? You never let me in! Why don't you ever let me in? I'll let you in... to your house. Busted! I'll get revenge. I'll get revenge! Revenge! As sure as my name is Colin! Colin de Cogolin. Colin de Cogolin! I recognize him! He's a weakling. That yellow copied me! Time to cut and paste you. Busted! No! Not busted... I'm the one who busts. Worship me. I'm the real Brice! Prove you're me. You can't. So shut up. Double Bust! I said it's me! I recognize myself. This is me! Don't be silly. No one knows you. I do. I know who's the real one. Igor. Who are you? Igor d'Hossegor. Be fair, don't stare, I'm rare. Truth I do declare. The real Braïce is... him. Point to him. Him! But... What do you mean? It's me. No. What's this voice now? It's true I didn't before. Before, I'd say... I'm the new maintenance manager for Gregor d'Hossegor... But now I speak like this. You became a traitor. A disciple. A disciple of Braïce, our savior. He showed me the way. He is the sun. The high priest of Yellow Light! You've all gone crazy! Not at all. It's just the party and I'm a party-animal. I'd noticed. Yeah, I know. What a dumb blonde! I like you. Get rid of that. You said you were my friend! I didn't digest that jellyfish. At least I have a real bellybutton! Understand now? Nice meet? See yourself face to face? - I'm nothing like him! - Slightly exactly the same. Totally not true! Lower up your voice. Calm down. No need to calm down, I'm not upset! Why are you shouting? I'm not shouting! That's not shouting. This is! But this isn't shouting! You can't really tell by this, but yes... He's the one saving us. The king of bust. Hard to believe. Yeah but because he's... in a state of shock. As sure as my name's Marius, I'll have him thumbing along. How embarrassing! That Braïce is a Brice-robber. When they see who's the real Brice, they'll do a you-turn. Brice Paradise... shut down! All the Mao... the Mooa... the tribe will be saved. They don't believe I'm the real Brice. We'll show them. Go to Brice Paradise. Do a Bust-Off. Against the other one... There, I busted you... Then, humiliate him. Let's train. I'm all busted out. I have no more busts in me. You can't do this to me. Without you, we can't save them. BUST-OFF Bust-off! Braïciañitos... Braïciañitas... Welcome to our Bust-Off! Mister Gong! Hello, Carl. Let's see if you speak French. Dumb beanpole. Classy. My busts fly higher. They're "cloud-busts". So blow away. Busted! Braïce de Hawaiice... A beauty, how ugly. An idiot, how dumb. I rarely bust babes. I count dummies out. - You can count? - Up to 1,000. Pretty and smart. Mother Nature scares you... The milk may be organic but the carton is plastic. Bastard! Busted! You'll go from Big Daddy Joke to Big Daddy Broke. I can out-bust you. Faster than hi-speed net, I'll make you sweat. What was that? You broke the speed of trite. Busted! Go on. You have to go back. It's you. Not him. You're the king of bust. Come back! I'm a little scared. I'm pathetic. You're not pathetic. I understand. It's the tiny voices. Tiny Brices with tiny wings. - They go in by the holes. - What holes? What holes... Naivety! How many orifists in the face? Seven. Eyes, nose, mouth, ears. What do the tiny voices do? The tiny Brices? Like little Brice-flies. They go in, into the hole. It's there... Got it! "You're pathetic, you're pathetic..." Gotta get them out. The other goes in. "You can't, you can't..." You swallowed it. The tiny voice goes in. It gnaws away inside... Try as Marius did to help me find my bustiness, in my head it was like... ride pudding. It's hopeless. Life is going to be difficold. You must leave. No big deal. For the gutter. No big deal. Eat raw rats. No big deal. No big deal. It sort of sucks. Someone stole your Brice curlers? Not pretty, not funny. Vencelas, it says so here. You weren't told. Names ending in "as" bust my ass. - Since when? - Now. Mouth too full. - Listen to me... - Mouth too empty. Busted. BUSTAGE ZONE Beware falling losers I'll ask once, twice, 3 times! Me! I know you. Look at his feet! What loser feet! What a freak! Enough, Brice. Don't be stupid. I've been thinking. Thinking... If that's what you want, vaya con dios. Fabrice? Papa! My sonfish, You crossed the ocean for me? Don't leave, Papa. Friendship is one of the most beautiful things in life. The animals and fish have run away. Because of the noise you make all night long. Wrong. We make daytime noise too. While you laugh, there are women and kids who cry, full of sadness. I'm stumped! I'm stumped with sadness! At my place, the deformed get discharged. This isn't your place. You chased away a whole village into the forest! The Abori jeans. And believe me, you're responsible! You're all responsible! Sorry, I'm very moved. First time I see an animal speak. I'm telling you now, stop... Relax, no one's listening. Busted! Brice! You're still here? I thought maybe you'd invite me up? I'll ask you down instead. Come and lose, if you dare. I need your thumbs up. Go on, Braïce! Brice! The famous Brice de Nice. Not too scared? Of the void? Of me. Same thing. Nice start. You'll hate the end. You won't ever see it. Done warming up? Serve first. Or get the crying over with now. I saw Brice Paradise. You succeeded at my life. but failed at your own. Failed? Brice Paradise, Yellow king size parties I know. boobs and booze, costs a ton, guess who won. And I did it all alone. Normal, no friends. Useless. You're missing out on the most beautiful thing in life. You missed out on your joke. Boring! You're out of gas? I'm not out of gas... Yes, he is. We'll be dancing on our feet. For your defeat. never lose: bad news. They let you win, has-been. I let them lose. Totally meaningless, like you. You'll understand at hospital. I won't be getting hurt. No one gets hurt here. Just very hurt. I don't feel anything yet. I'm bored even. Go on! Because you're lacking in vocabulary. Go to school? Yeah, I busted ass. I know who you are! A Bodhi wannabe, the dumb waiter from that lousy flick, "Point Break". Isn't that it? Not Bodhi. Loser! Want something? I have talent to spare. I don't need a hand. Take an arm instead. Wait! Time out! You can't fight it. I'm you but better. Your version 2.0, your evolution. Bigger, stronger, better... a mega-you! You're right. What? I said you're right. Throwing in the towel? There is no towel. Fight! Even you said it. I'm selfish. My brain is too small to think of anyone else. And I'm pretentious. I'm no God, just godawful. This is too cool. The worst is, I'm a liar. Brice. The only wave I rode was last summer's heat wave. So we all agree you're a piece of shit! Yes. And since you're a mega-me, you're a mega-shit. Mega-selfish, mega-pretentious, mega-godawful, mega-liar and mega no reason to be on that board. Ouch. Pretty damn good. He killed you. No, watch out... I didn't mean it that way. You did. Dream on, Brice! I'm keeping my throne! And losing face. I'll bust you. Go bust a move. I'm stronger! You smell stronger. - You bastard! - Bad move! - I'll win. - A stretcher. Braïce, you're like the last "i" in Hawaii. Double and useless. Collector bust. Busted! Bye, Colin. First time I bust myself! Ridiculous! How pathetic! A hair sticker! I'll get revenge as sure as my name is Colin! And so, everything went back to normal. Marius was right. No one wanted to wear the colors of Braïce the usurper anymore. The party-people left the island. Braïce Paradise ended up shutting down. We never again saw Colin de Cogolin. The tribe resumed its former life. They found joy and happiness once again. I did that on purpose. On purpose. Like this if you're Goofy. Otherwise like this. It depends. To keep me always among them, me, Brice, their savior, the tribe cut down for me the sacred tree of their ancestors and sculpted it into an invaluable gift. Take the heart of our sacred tree. No thanks. It's not that pretty. Hey, idiot. Come here. He wants it but... Before you go I want you to know... I won't miss you. Same here. I'll always be your best enemy. I'll never forget all you didn't do. I'm glad to know I can never count on you. I'll never be there when you need me. I wish you the worst of luck. Don't take care. You neither. Why not stay with us? Now you have nothing. I've learned my lesson. It's all over. Surfing in Nice. Yellows... I'm changing my life. Damn, you're... I'll do mountains bust-offs. I hear they have hard waves. It'll be cool. You really are one of a kind. Stop it, I don't like that. Bye! You got a long way! Plenty of time to kill! Wait! I'm coming along! Wait! Come on! Good riddance! Hold on. Climb on. I don't want to get on that. Boats are dangerous. You can fall into the water. Oh yeah... Can you push me? The end. So what have we learned from this story, kids? The importance of friends? Yes, what else? It's bad to be selfish? True. Laugh at yourself, not at others? Yes. To protect nature. What else? Mourn what we'd like to be to become who we are? Very good point. What else? That Gregor is mean? Igor is weak. He's a weakling. Fish can feel pain. Good point. But what you must really keep in mind... is that this whole story isn't even true. I told you a total crock of shit. Busted! Weakling! BRICE 3 ...because I busted the 2. Subtitles: Andrew Litvack Subtitling: HIVENTY
