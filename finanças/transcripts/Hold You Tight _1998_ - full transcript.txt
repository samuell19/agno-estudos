Time for one more group photo! That's good! Today is the last day in HK. Let us take one more photo. Ready? 1, 2, 3, Give Mummy one last kiss before you go. Don't let Mr. Gao know that I saw JoJo. Yes, madam. Now go. Where is my handbag? What? I need my handbag. I don't have your handbag. What? You don't have my handbag? You were carrying in the taxi! I know, but JoJo was crying You left my handbag in the taxi? With my passport, telephone and everything! I'm sorry, madam. Sorry? You are sorry... That's a weird apartment, no door on the bathroom. It'll be hard to sell. Different strokes... maybe someone will love it. Right, some of those on Alex's list. Let's pass it on to Alex. Good plan. Is your car fixed? Ready the day after tomorrow. Why? I promised my girlfriend a barbecue on Sunday. So I need to borrow your car. You don't use it on days off anyway. Naughty, always wanting my car. What's wrong with that? If I was wanting you, you'd be in trouble! Wouldn't worry me! I've to be in Vancouver this time. And... How many times must I tell you? Spare me. I got it the first time. You have to be with your sister in Vancouver. I know, I got it. What I don't get is where I fit in. But my mother... Not again! Bobo? I'm on my way, I'll pick you up from work. Talk to you later. Women are a hassle. Going back to the office? What? Going back? Don't know. What does that mean? Yes or no? OK, I'll get off here. See you. Don't be late tomorrow. OK, but don't forget about the car. I'm counting on you. Thank you. Sit here. Why on earth did you come? You think the streets are paved with gold? Think we eat shark's fin every meal? Think I have nothing else to do? You need constant attention. You can't even go to the doctor alone. You're off your head! I don't care if you can hear me or not. You old zombie! Past your time! At your age, you should die. Crazy old zombie! Think I have time on my hands? My turn today, don't fight me for the bill. Going for lunch? Want company? Maybe next time. I'm changing jobs next month. You need a nice new apartment, you'll go to my colleague here. I'll introduce you. This is Mr. Tong. I've seen you before. Nice to meet you. If I can help at all, feel free to call me. Your wife and I were old friends. The staff have all chipped in for the memorial service. You need a hand with all that stuff? That crazy girl, accumulating all this. Here's your food! Come on. Over here. Good, now it's your turn. Thank you for using HK Telecom's Voice-Mail Service. You have no new messages. Ah Hark, when did you last speak to Eric? Eric Wang. Just wondered if you'd heard from him. I got a fax from Kar-To today. He says Eric's boyfriend in London died. Just last week. Apparently the lawyer told him he has to move out within seven days. Eric's state of health? Kar-To didn't say. Whatever happens, he won't turn to his family. He's too strong-headed. Try and talk to him. See if he needs help. Money is no problem. Just tell me how much he needs. Right, give him a call first. OK, bye. Although you are my first lover, you are also my last. You are my one and only... Mahjong? No thanks. Screw you! I hate throwing money away. I find it physically painful! Even just a few hundred dollars! I don't mind losing, but it's such a waste of time. And for you, sir? Milk tea and a pineapple bun, please. You're crazy, I have to work! Thanks. We didn't meet properly last time, I'm Tong. Fung Wai, call me Wai. If you want to buy or sell an apartment, I'm your man. You're in the same building as my wife. Really? Winnie's a lucky girl. Not Winnie. Sorry... The pineapple buns are famous here. My wife died last month. She was flying to Taipei for a meeting. She never got there. My sympathies. Smart, call for you. It's you! Time really flies. Was it that long ago? Has your Brazilian oil well dried up? No, no change. Having a baby hurts like hell. Never again. A drink? If I get drunk, he'll give me hell again. It makes the most of the space. This is South? Yes. I'll get you some water. Thanks. Thanks. It's nicely finished. Can I take a look in the bedroom? Good view. It's a nice apartment. When did you move in? Around half a year ago. You're a computer pro! It's a living. Really? You install computers? I need someone to fix one for me. The human brain is getting left behind. Artificial Intelligence is getting smarter. I mainly write software for people. All the same. It's good to be freelance, no boss to answer to. It's very well planned. If you decide to sell you should clear 50% profit. You bought it while it was going up? Ah Moon... My wife queued two whole nights to get it. You were too busy yourself? No, we took turns in the queue. She took over from me when she finished work. For two nights in a row. I never queued so long for anything in my life. All good experience, I suppose. Life's over before you know it. Smoke? Yes, life rushed by. This is the most cheerful one we've seen. If you like it. But that gorgeous one in the catalogue isn't here. Which one? We look at so many catalogues. It's really not bad. Try it! But it's $3000 more... what do you think? That one's OK too. Won't it show the dirt? Ask them if they have other colours. Actually the $3000 is no problem. David can help us get the dining table at a discount. So we can save around $2000 on that. It all evens out. Settle for it, then. All up to you! Shall we buy a TV cabinet or get one made? It may be a problem if I don't come. My position isn't that secure! They're such bastards! Tell Winnie not to be scared. Just say the computer files are all password-protected. No, don't mention that. Let's keep that detail in reserve. Whatever they say, I'll take responsibility. Got it? If anything goes wrong, call me right away. I'll rush over. Don't listen to Paul, he's not your boss. Of course! I don't care what the almanac says! Can't you just throw that junk out? Finished on the phone? If we don't leave now we'll be late. The traffic may be very bad. OK, that's the lot. I'll be back for the stuff we're keeping. Please handle those boxes with care. Hang on... What's in there? These are! Haven't you seen an LP before? When did you collect all those? How come I never saw them before? No different from all your perfume samples. It is different! Sure it is, you didn't have to pay for them. I saved for all my LPs since I was a kid. Fung Wai, what did you just say? Say that again! I said, don't touch my LPs! Hello Auntie, is the 'feng-shui' master there yet? Ah Wai and I are on our way over now. The bed should have been delivered by now. Fine, please take care of it for me. In a blink, fate arrives and the sky becomes clouded again. Please, please tell me I'm wrong. I can sense it coming. In a blink, fate arrives... Don't mark the wallpaper! I know. Move it to the master bedroom. Dressing table against that wall. Then help fix the mirror, will you? Okay. Ah Wai, Auntie's leaving. I'll see her off. Ask her to stay for supper. Ah Wai! Ah Wai! What is it? Are you still playing with that thing? The modern isn't working, maybe it's the phone line. Can you check the water heater? The water's lukewarm. It's OK. Really, is the VCR properly wired up? Bingo! Can you take down the garbage now? You do it, I've just showered. You've missed the garbage collection today. This heat is murderous. Where've you been? You've been gone all afternoon. I went jogging. You're so untidy. What? I said, if we don't go now we'll miss the start of the dinner. Can't hear you! I said, I'm not going to mother you! What? I want to tell you I hate these dinners. I hate schmoozing these guys. All I want is to take a hot shower. And for you to hold me tight in the bathtub. And hear you say again that you love me. And tell me that I don't have to fear those bastards. Don't spoil my make-up! Don't be too long, I'll wait in the car. The giant portrait of Deng Xiaoping hangs in the centre. The urn containing his ashes is covered with the national flag. Ah Yin, freshen this up for me. Our nation's highest leaders are in attendance, including Jiang Zemin... Yes, it is. What exactly are you looking for? A Japanese schoolgirl with a black guy? You saw an ad for it? No we don't. No, we don't have that either. I think you have the wrong store, we don't carry Category III titles. Don't mention it. Just off work? Look around. Anything special? Need any advice? No thanks, just looking. Just moved in? How can you tell? It's pricey here, and we're miles out of town. You just married and moved here to escape from your parents, right? How to fill those long evenings after work? Curl up with a good laser disc, right? It beats having to chat with your 'better half. Sorry, just kidding. When's the baby due? In a month or so. Had a scan? Boy or girl? My husband won't let the doctor tell me. He thinks a surprise is more exciting. He's a so-and-so. I'm sure he just wants you to be happy. I know that. It bugs me. Everybody in the family knows except me. Which would you prefer? It doesn't matter...either way, it's my baby. I like... Why not have one yourself! Couldn't support it! You're kidding, how do you think I'll cope? Yes. OK. Next time I'll give you a year's free membership. OK, bye. Thanks. Jie! Please put back the chairs after hosing down the floor. I'll be upstairs if you need me. You can call me in the office. You know, nobody cares where those plants go. Hi, you're new here, aren't you? Hi, I'm Chris. This is Ronald, this is Jimmy. Hi! Jimmy says he wants to meet you. He says you look like his ex-lover. Heard that line before? It's OK. I thought you might be dumb. Now you know I'm not. Sorry! Didn't mean it. Never mind, we're all friends. Crazy guy! Ah Wai, is that my phone? The phone! Hello? Hang on. Thanks. You're joking, what time is it? I've been paging you all afternoon. What am I supposed to do about it now? I was bored to death, so I've come swimming with my husband. Seafood on Lamma Island? How do we get there? You'll pick us up in Tuen Mun? Really? OK, let's do it! See you later. Let's go. Quick. How should I know? It was OK just now. It just cut out suddenly Really, everything went dark. The lights are still on next door. Can you send someone over? What's your name? How come you're so rude? Membership card, please. You said you'd never looked at HK by night. So now you have. Thanks for bringing me here. Otherwise no-one in Taiwan would believe I'd been here so long without coming up The Peak. I'd have no 'face'. You come to Hong Kong when you were young? I'm still young! See, that's the Tsing-Ma Bridge. You know what it's for? Is this a test? Cigarette? My mother died many years ago. My dad took me from Tainan to Taipei. Somehow or other I ended up here. I heard my dad now lives in Shenzhen. I've no idea how many wives he has. No other relatives in Hong Kong? No-one can keep track of me, I don't even have a phone. Ah Wai has no family here either. They all emigrated. Ah Wai is your husband? When he comes to the pool, he's like a robot. Never blinks or tilts his head. If the sky crashed down, he'd miss it. Must be a funny guy to live with. Don't be so mean (sui). You call me handsome (sui). Sure, I'm very handsome (sui). Yes, very handsome. Take one last look, we should go. You seem subtly different today. What's this eloquence? Are you quoting someone? Crazy! Right, I'm crazy about you. Don't joke about it. Every night when I think of you with Ah Wai I really do go crazy. Are we behaving like characters in a weepie? I never watch weepies. Almost forgot... This is for you. What is it? Cologne? It's for a man! Don't laugh at me. It's my favourite scent and I want to know how it smells on the one I like best. This seems the only way to find out. Don't behave like this. I hope you'll remember me by this scent. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. I want to come back with you. Impossible. It's so late, it's not convenient. Then is it convenient here? What are you doing? Don't speak. You know what? Each orgasm is like the end of the world. Like we're dying together. So you'll co-ordinate the tea party? Is Chan Ching back yet? Haven't heard from her since she married that foreigner. Ask her to join us. Divorced? When? They seemed very happy when I saw them in San Francisco. Her husband left her? She's always behaved like that. Turns every little thing into a major grievance. Stupid! Still up! I'm downloading the Beta version of some new software. You go to bed first. You didn't eat earlier? Did you? Wasn't hungry, I was so busy. The paper I have to present in Taiwan tomorrow. They're still working on the graphics. Those noodles smell great. I'll make some for you. Great! Thanks. My pleasure. Here you are. That's great. You'll get indigestion if you read while you eat. You always eat at the computer. What is it? I've known you so long, but I've never seen you wolf down food like that. You've known me so long? Since we started dating, isn't that long enough? Just what I wanted! Another bowl, Ma'am? No thanks, I'll get fat. Can you check out that course for me on the Internet? What course? Self-awareness. Not your thing! Huh? I know, a circle of people holding hands in the dark belting out 'My Way'. Include me out! I shouldn't have asked. It's a bit late to say that. Sadist! Too late for regrets! How's your ear? Is it any better? What did the doctor say? No change. What does that mean? Incurable. I always forget, which ear is it? The left one. This one? No, the other left ear. It might lose hearing altogether? Actually, I'm deaf in that ear already. I'll just have to get by with one. Maybe I won't notice the difference. Why didn't your family get it treated when you were a kid? There were too many of us kids to worry about. Never mind anyway, I'm not a hi-fi nut. If you went stone deaf, you could ignore all my complaints. I never said that! What are you doing? Taking a look! I've never seen a deaf ear. Wake up or you'll miss your flight. What time is it? I'm starving! Shall I make breakfast? I'd like...you! Calm down! Get up, I'll make up breakfast. You're so obliging. I'll bring you back some Taiwanese hotpot. Crazy! You only think about food in the mornings! Wake up! Come on, get up! After checking in, I'll call you from the hotel Business Centre. You can send me the graphics then. Right. I know how to deal with Jean-Paul. Get it done as soon as you can. You left my handbag in the taxi? With my passport, telephone and everything. He looks like his mum! You think so? Just like his lovely mum! I think he's more like his dad. Isn't the 'geung cho' here yet? Call 4th Aunt and ask! It should be here, I'll check. His dad must be so happy. Sir, what's in there? My wife's ashes. Hi, this is Moon. It's you! Can't take your call right now. Leave your message after the Beep, Bye! Try the sausage, it's famous here. I'm not hungry. You didn't have lunch? You must eat something! Thanks. All the funeral ceremonies are over? I know a guy at that cemetery, he can get you a good plot. Thank you. But her family... Feel free to ask for my help any time. No ulterior motive, I like to help people when I can. Not many people like you these days. Right, it's not trendy. Everything has to be 'cool' nowadays. No matter what, you must be 'cool'. Date a boy... Date a girl...but stay cool. We're just old-fashioned! What's the time? After nine. You have an appointment? I have to turn in a programme tomorrow. Damn! I've been out all day, my cat will be starving! Shall we go? Thanks, Wing. If you don't want to sell the place, then don't! Money can't buy back everything! Shall I drop you off? No need, thanks. Sorry... I ran into a friend in the sauna. I just got here myself. Hunky, a Chivas. Don't you get tired of drinking beer? It leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. I'm used to it. Try something else. Keep an open mind! Things are better that way. Take it from me...No, never mind me. Thanks. You look good! Been swimming? Actually all exercise is good for you. Better than hiding away at home. Left alone, you'd stay home and live on instant noodles. Let's meet again when you feel better. I'll cook you something good. You're regular here? I usually stop by for a couple of drinks after work. Single people like me have nothing to do at home. But play with the cat... or cook. Keep myself company. I'd be lost without bars to go to. Can't remember last time I was in a bar. When can you start? Right away. Can't remember last time I was in a bar. I met Ah Moon soon after I graduated. She didn't like people going to bars. She said bars are for losers. I was afraid she'd think me a loser. You did computer science? Computers are good. Obedient. Don't give you a hard time. They understand you, you understand them. I can write in 'C' language. But I never really get other people's meanings. Knowing things is good. But so is not knowing. I knew one guy, he always said he couldn't get what I was saying. I finally twigged that he just wasn't interested. So I stopped talking. Jie. Another round please. Coming up. Jie? Jie! You look familiar. Have we met before? Maybe. Jie is smart. He used to be a lifeguard. A lifeguard? Right. Saved any lives? Whisky on the rocks. Chivas straight. Thanks. Nice wedding ring. No nibbles tonight? Can I see it? It's sad that I can't introduce my wife to you. She isn't here? Why not? Bring us some nibbles. Your wife is dead? Kids are strange these days. My wife died. Ah Wai... It's over now. Ah Wai... I'll help him up to his place. Can you manage alone? Sure. Got any cigs? Thanks. I always think that I don't want to know. You won't see me again. I'm going back to Taipei today. Too expensive! Give her a discount! You won't find this cheaper anywhere in Taipei. These Hong Kong people are cunning. Yes, we should fly to Hong Kong and buy clothes there. This one is gorgeous. Too loud! Yes, too loud. I'd prefer something plain. OK, I'll throw in some stockings too. You'd look good in black stockings. Make it two pairs! Only if you pay cash, no credit card. Keep looking around. Shall I get this or not? It's not bad, buy it. OK! Madam... How about pink stockings? Pink's in right now. Yes, two pairs. Pink. Sorry, sold out. OK, I'll settle for black. We sell that scent too. They're having a 1997 promotion. Just a moment, I'll get one for you. No need. Let's go. Don't forget your bag. Thanks, how much altogether? NT$7,100. Call it NT$7,000. OK, NT$7,000 it is. Here you are...NT$7,000. Thank you. Many thanks, do come again. When will you have new stock? In two weeks. Fine, we'll come by then. Thanks! Thanks! Bye. Bye. Sorry, excuse me. I'm shattered! That scent... Never mind, I'm just looking. It would be good on you. It's rather strong, not for everyone. You use it? Lately I don't like light scents. Ma'am... Do you have that T-shirt in other colours? Yes, several. I'll come again. What colour do you want? What have you got? A big choice... Did you find that scent? Where are you? I'm just wondering if you like Japanese food. Depends who I'm eating it with. I was thinking of inviting you. But I'm broke. I'd love some uni paste. Mrs. Gao, what would you like to drink? Sake would be fine. Okay. How are you? Mrs. Gao. Call me Rosa... I'm divorcing Mr. Gao. And what shall I call you? Dou Jie. You can call me Jie. Jie. So what do you want, Jie? I don't know. I don't know anything. Let's start with some uni paste. Speak to my lawyer about the apartment. I won't fight over it. All I want is my own share. What? Your own share? Then why have you left JoJo with me? I have a better idea. Let's get the lawyer to work out your share of JoJo too. Fine! Which part of JoJo do you want? The head? Listen to me. You have JoJo now only because your mother was so considerate. I'm not exchanging my daughter for anything! That's rot! My mother was just asking when JoJo last saw you. There's no need to get angry. The shop must be going downhill with your temper. Should I come back to Taipei to lend a hand? Lend a hand? Who says I'm doing badly? I don't need any favours from you. I don't need this crap. OK, forget I said it. Your temper is really... Our daughter's birthday is next month. Ask Jean to organise a party for her. Or your mother... I don't need you to remind me of that! Try this beef. It's delicious. You look cheerful today. I made some money as a movie extra. So I'll treat you. So you walked straight into a job. Away from home, everyone needs friends to count on. Away? I thought this was your home! I have no home. Have some more wine. Did you make many friends in Hong Kong? Sure, what kind of friend are you looking for? I'll be happy to introduce you. Me? I like... affluent ones. A Bentley-driving cigar smoker. Got any of those? Imperial-style meatball! Thanks. Did anyone tell you how much older you look when you're angry? Like an old grump! Come on, away from home you need friends to count on. What's upsetting you? Who says anything is? OK, that's good. Come on, cheers! Very good-looking boys here. You like them? What are you implying? Why shouldn't you like men? I have women friends I like very much! I thought you liked that Ah Wai? No. You got me wrong. I don't think so. What? Hi, Rosa. Long time no see! Hi, Tony! What are you doing here? Poaching on our territory? How could I? Oh, excuse me, I see you've brought your own young man. How are you? This is Tony, this is Jie. Hi! Tony, you want to join us? Another time. There's this really cute guy. Terribly good-looking. Over there by the bar, white sports shirt. Not bad, huh? Not bad! I've been working on him all night but he keeps telling me that he's straight! I don't like men! So what the hell is he doing in Funky? Shall I chat him up for you? Maybe not. If I let you loose him, Rosa I may as well give up now. I'd better make sure he hasn't run away. OK. Good luck! You've gone very quiet. Where were we? I forget. Let's dance. You should spit out the other stuff you're bottling up inside, too. And don't tell me there isn't anything! You don't have to worry about me. You're hopeless! You don't let anyone near you! I'll be OK, don't worry. Fine! "I'll OK, don't worry". Then I'll go home and have a nice sleep. Rosa! Don't leave me on my own. I'm scared. Why? What do you want? Do you know? Jie, stop upsetting other people! I want to talk to him. I really want to talk to him! To who? To Ah Wai! Then do it! Tell him! I don't know what to tell him. Tell him what's in your heart. Come on. Call him right away. Right now! Hi, this is Moon. It's you! Can't take your call right now. Leave me your message after the beep. Bye! Don't look at that, come over here! My piece de resistance: Chilled crab. You're in luck. I found a great crab in the market. How about a drink? I have some Chardonnay in the fridge. Whatever, I know nothing about wine. You like watching movies? You mean that poster? My friend gave it to me. Actually, I'm not that keen on movies. The one who said he couldn't get your meanings? Of course not, someone else. When did I mention that guy to you? I forget. This is a huge crab! To follow: abalone and rice in lotus leaf. Will that be enough? You want to stuff me like a pig, ready for the kill? You got it! Let's initiate the pig project! I mustn't drink too much. Don't want to wake reeking of scent again wondering what the hell happened. No problem. Those who dine chez moi get driven home! Lets eat. Hello, who is it? Oh, it's my pig project! Can't sleep from overeating? Where are you? On my way home...what's up? There was a message on the answering machine. It was Jie. He said many things. Next time, don't listen. Come downstairs, I'll be back to pick you up. This beach... that's China over there. Many illegal immigrants have landed here. I wouldn't trade places with them. Living life in endless fear of being found out. If Jie hadn't told me I'd have thought it was you that night. I'm allergic to scents. What else did he say? Jie's message blew me away. Suddenly so many things became clear. While I was waiting for you in the lobby, I wondered... Why did I call you? Because you're nearby and easy-going? Because I knew you'd come back for me? Obviously because I was nearby and easy-going. You didn't call because I'm so handsome! If you call someone and he doesn't reply for three days what kind of friend is he? Actually I really don't know why you're so kind to me? Don't imagine things. You're not getting special treatment. I'm kind to everyone. Do you like me? I haven't 'liked' anyone for a long time. I've decided never to do so again. Don't let it worry you. I wasn't worried. Just want to tell you sooner or later you'll meet someone. You'll treat him well. He'll treat you well too. Then you'll forget all these bad times. You'll put all this far behind you. The key thing is to give yourself the chance. And you? Me? You know where to find me if you want to. That's not what I meant. I give myself those chances every day. You just haven't noticed. Staring at that poster at home? Fung Wai what are you saying? Say that again! 16th September, 1984. Remember what you were doing that day? Is this a test? 16th September, 1984. Going back to school after summer vacation, that's all. I can't remember either. Why ask? It's strange. Things may come your way or get lost without rhyme or reason. As if you woke up in the morning and found you'd been burgled in the night and lost many things only to have the thief return the stuff he didn't want. Sadness is in the air. I am doomed... For ever not to touch beautiful things. History is repeating itself. In this bustling city... Loves comes with undercurrent. What does it mean to go on loving you? Shall I make it if I told you tight? Please, please tell me I'm wrong. I can sense it coming. The sky maybe deep without any fracture. A shade gathers on the face. The house maybe dark with only shadows. I can still read your mind.
