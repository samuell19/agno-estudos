Captain Friedrich. Please accept my condolences. I'll come with you. I'm in charge of the investigation about your husband. I knew your husband. We had some... Explain to me why I was alone at his burial. Well... He didn't have any friends? It's not quite right. You know how it is when someone succeeds too well in business. What do you mean by "succeeding too well"? He never wrote to you? No, we have been separated for three years. He sent a check every three months without a word. You were engaged in a divorce procedure? Who do you think may have been angry enough to kill him? It's hard to say. He had made many enemies. His temper wasn't exactly... Yes, I know. Who warned you? His solicitor sent me a telegram. I took the first train. My husband was probably having an affair with a woman. It's possible. But I don't see who. Has he been killed for money? I don't know. I don't think so. I'll stay here a few days to fix everything. I'm at your disposal. But I'm certain that you know more about this than I do. I must confess that I don't know much for the time being. People here are not very talkative. Buy you can be confident that we will do our best. If you need anything... "In exchange of 150.000 schillings you could learn the name of your husband's murderer. Are you interested?" The A or B lunch, madam? I don't care. Let's say A. So, what has she ordered? She doesn't care. She's not angry? I can't believe it. Anyway, be kind and take care of her. You never can tell. Keep quiet. You talk too much. The more we age, the more stupid we become. Excuse me, madam. Let me introduce myself. My name is Franz Silbert. I'm a foreman at the Voellmer sawmill. That's the reason for your absence at the burial? A little, yes. Stopping the machines and giving a day off to the employees are not the habits of the owner. At least, you're frank about it. You didn't like him very much? It's true. Like all his employees, by the way. It wasn't in our contract. He gave us money, we gave him results. That's all. He came often at the factory? Every day. Sit down. Come here, Clara. Did my husband have relations with people from here? The same relations lumberjacks usually have with trees. You see what I mean? Yes, I see. Quick. Look at the widow, she doesn't waste her time. And my vegetables? I can't eat my meat without vegetables. I mean, walk in my shoes. Where were you again? If you weren't my daughter, I would have fired you a long time ago. Impossible. I'd be gone before. You know how you will end? A whore? I know, you already told me. That's no way to talk to your mother. You see the result of her studies. And to say that you wanted her to continue. I'm going to bed. I'm the lady from room 25. My room is just in front of yours. How convenient, isn't it? I'm sorry, perhaps I'm disturbing you in your work? I couldn't sleep and I saw some light in your room. So I came in. How can I help you? I don't know yet. Does it feel good? It's cold. No, wait... Behind these windows, there's certainly the man who killed Voellmer. The problem for us is that there are too many windows. The sawmill was doing so well that he was able to speculate on lands. And then he launched into real estate. Expropriations, seizures, evictions... He caused a lot of misery but he didn't care. He even bought the hotel where you're staying. I didn't know that he was so wealthy. You're the only heiress. But we were almost divorced. Not according to the law. You will probably find a will in favour of someone else. Mr Voellmer knew very well the law. If it had been his wish, he would have told me. We haven't found anything. You inherit from everything in the most legitimate way. Is it possible that I may compensate all those he has dispossessed? I have all the files. I can prepare a draft. I count on you, sir. I will need your instructions for specific cases. Among others, the technical director of the sawmills, You'll have to replace him. He must leave at the end of the month. Mr Voellmer had fired him. The fiesta is over. The boss is no more but work is as tough as ever. - Old habits die hard. No news about the widow? - Is she selling? - We don't know yet. Back to work, men. I'm back. I hope I'm not disturbing you during work. Don't worry. I would like to visit. Why? - Everything's mine now. In that case, follow me please. The sawmill is just behind that wood. All these trees belong to you. Tell me... You didn't mention that you had been fired. It's the contrary. I asked Mr Voellmer to find me a replacement. You want to know the reason? I'm not interested. You don't seem interested in many things. On the contrary. There are the offices. The warehouses where we store the wood. All the forest over there belonged to Mr. Voellmer. To the top of the mountain. What kind of letter is that? One of those letters that kind people forget to sign before sending them. You told the police? I'd rather find that person by myself. What's your opinion? I have none. It's not my business. Don't you think it could come from an employee? You could inquire. I will try. Keep it then. See you tonight. But in your place... No, nothing. You've come from the sawmill? Is Franz Silbert up there? Yes, I just left him. I wanted to tell you... If you learn something please tell me. Alright. You too. Here's your key, madam. You are certainly accustomed to more comfortable hotels. But you can be sure that we'll do our best to make your stay very pleasant. Despite the tragic circumstances. You're here at home. I know. "If you're interested by our offer, stay in your room tonight. We'll communicate you how you must proceed. Any indiscretion on your part could have unfortunate consequences." You had a quarrel with Mr. Voellmer. Why? I never hurt anyone in my life. You must believe me. But I'm jolly glad of what happened to him. Voellmer expelled me from my house. I have two children. Yes, I said I would kill him. One says so much when drinking. I'm stuck in a single room for two years with my parents and my wife because of him. Do you think he's worthy of having a statue made of him? My husband was mad at him but he was always very nice with me. We had to get married but he made my fianc√© lose his job so we are still engaged. I know the murderer. But why would I tell you? You're paid to find out. Do your job. I'm coming for the blanket, madam. I'm storing your coat? If you want. You're not coming down to dinner, madam? You want me to bring you a tray or a tea? I'm sorry but I didn't see you at dinner. It's about the letter. I checked but it doesn't fit any typewriter of the sawmill. After you left the Captain came in and searched everywhere. Don't be frightened. It's probably a bad joke but it won't go any further. Wait until you see what I have just received. "If you're interested by our offer, stay in your room tonight. We'll tell you how to proceed." You haven't seen anyone yet? - No, you're the first. It might be me after all. Who knows? I'm disturbing you? Not at all. Come in. I had something to check with the hotel owner. Someone told me that you were in your room. So I came up to say goodnight and see if you needed anything. No, it's very kind of you. - Yes, even policemen can be courteous. Something new? Sort of. Well, nothing very important yet. But I am hopeful. I won't bother you any longer. Why did he come? Just to say good night? Certainly not. - Do you think he noticed something? It's possible. What's he going to think after seeing us together in my room? You know how the police think... Anyway, I don't care at all. It's obvious. I admit I'm a little nervous. I feel that I'm being watched but I don't know for what reason. Money. Not only, there's something else behind this. Maybe I should have told him about the rest. Yes, perhaps. It's you, little slut, who sent us the copper? "It's you, little slut, who sent us the copper?" You don't have to stay alone with her. Poor girl, I wonder what's going on in your head. You're mad. Why did you lock her up in her room? Someone's trying to blackmail her. They want three million. Poor man. Do you think I'm that stupid? Believe what you want, I don't care. You see, you're lying. I find her extremely beautiful and she's rich in millions. It must be very exciting for a man. You must be joking. Franz, I'm going to kill you. But you'd still love me? - Yes, I would. The sad truth is that you love me and you're jealous. Damn you. - Come on. You disgust me. You can sleep with her, I don't care. I think it's funny. "Bring 150.000 shillings in small bills at the little cabin tonight between 8 and 9 o'clock. It is unnecessary to emphasise the need for you to act discreetly." I need some information. - Of course, it's my job. If I show you an envelope with a few written words... Is it enough to identify the typewriter? - Certainly. "Mrs. Voellmer". Pleased to meet you. My condolences, madam. Thank you. Do you recognise the typewriter? I think so... The O's, the A's... It's one of mine. I can't be fooled. Here it is. The best of its kind. I strongly recommend it. Strike force, solid bodywork, speed is around 3600 per hour. 3600 words, of course. Did you sell many of them? To those who appreciate quality. Mr Voellmer, the solicitor, the city hall... Where do I have to get it delivered? Mrs. Voellmer. How are you Mrs Voellmer? I'm fine, Captain. By the way, there was a special reason to your visit in my room yesterday evening? Nothing special. I just wanted to warn you. Against whom? Against no one in particular but against everyone in general. I don't know if you have noticed but some people always think they can outwit the police. Believe me, madam. Your best interest is to trust us and to hide nothing from us. I assure you that I'm hiding nothing. Be careful. There's a murderer on the loose in this city. As long as we didn't get our hands on him, he's still very dangerous. I can't see why he would try to hurt me. It would be absurd. We can't be so sure until we learn why your husband was killed. There's so many reasons to kill. They are not always logical. This is what makes our job interesting. Ease my task. Do not expose yourself unnecessarily. I don't understand. On the contrary, I'm certain you understand very well. I'll go. Have a nice walk. Mr Silbert's office please? Over there. Behind you. Please carry on. Don't worry about me. Why are you looking at me like that? Are you afraid of me? How can I help you? I've received another letter. They ask for three million and I have an appointment tonight at the cabin. You intend to go? I'm unable to make my mind. I'm scared to death. And yet... I just met the captain. You told him about the letters? No, it's him who warned me about the danger I'm in. What danger? The murderer still on the loose. You think it's him who writes these letters? Or have them written. Everything's possible. If I don't go at the meeting... If I refuse to hand out the money... Who knows what might happen to me? Why not talking to the police? The police couldn't prevent the murder of my husband. You shouldn't underestimate Friedrich. He's a fine man. He alone can help you. I don't even know what's happening. Please help me. This is what I propose... That's it. 150.000 shillings. A tidy sum. You see, there's so much misery amongst these expropriated people that I have decided... - You're facing a tough task. The thing about charity is that you must always continue. That's my intention. - It is your absolute right. As this is an estate that is not yet resolved I'll ask you to sign me that receipt. You have the money? Come. Make believe that you're alone. I'll hide near the cabin. Call me at the slightest danger. I heard you screaming. What happened? I heard someone running away but I couldn't see him. And you? Did you recognise someone? Where were you? It's funny. I have the feeling that you don't trust me. Let's go back. There comes the man of my life. What's wrong with you? You're angry? I have forbidden you to come into my room when I'm not here. But you're here now. I've been thinking about it. It's possible that someone tries to blackmail her. I don't give a damn about what you think or don't think. On the other hand, I think you're capable of anything. I think you're the blackmailer. I love you. You're a genius. Indeed, I'm pretty pleased. - Now get out. As long as you're only after her money, I have nothing against it. On the contrary, I think it's a great idea. Only money matters? - I told you to get out. - Franz, you're a bastard. A tired bastard, yes... You're right after all. I don't want to have sex tonight. Thinking about all the money we're going to make with the widow is enough for tonight. I'll dream about it all night long. What's wrong? What happened again? I'm certain that the letters are typed in this house. I hear the sound of a typewriter for two nights. I don't know. I'm not hearing anything. Not now, earlier. - Earlier, I was sleeping. Maybe it's the professor still at work in the room next door. It can't be. Not at this hour. You're too nervous and you have nightmares. You should take sleeping pills. You mustn't excite yourself like this. It's you who... - Yes, madam. I was asked to deliver it to you immediately. I woke you up. If I have summoned you, madam, it's because I'm starting to understand this case. I think we're at the end of the road. I must warn you. The slightest wrong move on your part could be very inconvenient for us. You didn't try anything on your side? Well, I mean, I didn't do anything that could... At least, I hope so. - Perfect. Then we are reassured. I'm certain I'll have good news for you very soon. Within a week the murderer of your husband will be in jail. I almost forgot... From the initials, this must be yours. Yes, indeed. It has been discovered in the cabin where your husband has been killed. It's yours. Without you...- We don't have many clients but we're committed to them. You know that van? Of course, it's one of yours. I mean from your sawmill. Mr Silbert is at the wheel. Usually he takes the Jeep. Well. I'm sorry. It's that awful typewriter. I heard it again. And you think the sound came from my room? No, the sound came from the corridor, so I just wanted to tell you. Lies. You came in because you're persuaded that I write the letters and blackmail you. I'm certain that you have set your suspicions on me since the start. No, I swear. - If you seek a proof, don't mind me. You can search everywhere. I'll even help you. Are you satisfied now? I know, it's hard for you to understand me but I think I'm going mad. The sound is getting louder and wakes me every night, it frightens me to death. I'm trying to get my head around it but I cant. The problem is that you're the only one who can hear that noise. It it wakes you why it doesn't wake everyone in this hotel? It's pretty strange, don't you think? I don't know... - There's no machine. It's only in your head. Trust me, you should calm down. - I'll calm down when I learn the truth. I'll have to defend myself since I can't count on anyone, not even you. Why do you say that? A second ago you said I was mad. Calm down, it's useless to panic. It's only your nerves unravelling. That's why you find everyone suspicious. You can be certain that I'm not your enemy, on the contrary. I'll do my best to help you if you trust me. I'm disturbing you? I can come back later, you know... You have courage. Business is good? But I think you're going too fast, be careful. Careful about what? - Perhaps it's you who killed Voellmer. Of course it's me. It doesn't matter. It will stay our secret. As the rest. The rest? You know, the bank notes missing in Voellmer's cash register. I even saw the receipt you wrote to Voellmer. Your confession written in black and white. It was smart. Who told you? Voellmer, of course. He had no secrets for me, you know. I slept with him. You're so stupid sometimes. I love you. Good night, my friend. I'd like to have a word with you. It's all a rather delicate. It's about Franz. I'm listening. Franz is only interested in your money. I wanted to warn you because I find you friendly enough. Fine. Is that all? I came to tell you to stop deluding yourself. You already have enough trouble as it is. I don't know how to thank you. Yesterday you saved my life. Tonight you give me a great insight. A good deed every day, like a good girl-guide. You don't think that I told you that out of jealousy? Not at all. You would have no reason. You're so young, so lovely, so delicate... I'm really sorry if I have hurt you, madam. I'm so clumsy. Not at all. Don't sound so sorry, even if it fits you very well. You did me a great favour. Anyway, Franz told me he's already taken your three million. I must leave now. Life's beautiful. It's nice, it's Sunday, but I'm bored. You have breakfasts to serve, idiot. I admire you both. You must be healthy to maintain such a scheme. How are you this morning? I'm fine, thanks. - You could get some sleep? I have to talk to you. I'm listening. Not here. Later, near the woods. Mr. Silbert, I made up my mind. I decided to keep you. You will continue to assume the leadership of the sawmill. Tank you but I'm not interested anymore. If it is a question of salary I am willing to discuss the matter. No, I'm sorry. I have other projects. What sort? I have decided to set up my own business. It costs money. - Yes, I know. Notice that, if necessary, I would not refuse to help you. For what reason? Franz, don't you think this little game has gone on long enough? What little game? Don't try too hard. I know it's you who wrote the letters. It's Clara who told you that? Yes, it's her. I thought so. If you're so convinced why don't you go and tell the police? That's really what you want? Frankly, I was waiting more from you. Frankly, me too. I was hoping... What? It's useless. I know what I have to do now. This is ridiculous. You can't leave like that. You're right. My bill, please. - You leave us already? I must go home. I want to leave tonight. But the next train to Strasbourg only leaves tomorrow morning. At what time? 7.55 am. I'll bring your breakfast at 6. I hope you'll keep good memories of our town. Certainly. - I hope that we'll see you again soon. Who knows? I was waiting for you, Mrs Voellmer. One moment, please. That's it. So, it was you. Yes, it was me. Me alone. I saw you shooting at Voellmer. He told me about your meeting in the cabin. He wanted me to come with him. Why? The poor fellow was probably wary of you. It's you after all who fixed the appointment. But why did he choose the cabin as the meeting place? He was afraid that people learn that he was married. No one knew except me. And the solicitor, of course. He insisted that I attend the meeting but I refused. It bothered me. If you had shown everything would have happened otherwise. But that's just fine this way, madam. I was your age when I married Voellmer. I was rich and naive. I signed everything he wanted. When there was nothing left I couldn't say anything. It was legal apparently. Then he vanished. I finally found him years later. I wrote to him and he agreed to meet me. He was afraid of the scandal. You know the rest, you heard everything. I didn't want to kill him. I just wanted to take back what belongs to me. He answered with insults and brutality. You don't have to defend yourself, madam. In your place, I would have done the same. You have restored the situation, everything belongs to you now. You're going to call the police, aren't you? To have my name in the papers with the Captain's greetings? I'd rather have an agreement with you. How much? I won't be too demanding. I only want 25% of what you will inherit. 25%? - That's enough. I don't have very high needs. I hope Franz won't be too curious. He won't cause you any trouble. You won't see him anymore. What did you do with him? After what you told me about him, I was forced to get rid of him. I don't believe you. You're wrong. If this is true, my price will be higher. I want half. Me, I know what I want. You don't. We're the same. So, if we're the same... What would you do in my place? I don't know, madam. We had already checked your schedule in France. You had no alibi. I only needed a proof. You just gave it to me. I'm sorry, madam. Now if you want to follow me. You too.
