Yesterday. I met Mr Liang on the docks at Keelung. There was a meeting today at the Dong Huei Fang Restaurant. It was packed. You mean Mr Liang who fled to Japan after the Reform Movement failed? Mr Liang spoke for one hour and wrote out four poems. We found them deeply moving. One of the poems read: "Our homeland is torn asunder. "Our brotherly bond is ever tighter." A TIME FOR FREEDOM How long will you stay this time? Five days. Then I will go to Taichung with Mr Liang and we will come back. Last year. Your son had a fever. Has he recovered? He is well now. But it took two whole months. THE NEXT DAY We sincerely wish to resolve the issue of redeeming Ah Mei's contract. 300 liang is a large sum. Is it possible to negotiate some more? Ah Mei is pregnant by the heir to the Su family. He is ready to take her as his concubine. What have they decided? The Su family offers 200 liang. But Madame asks for 300. So they couldn't agree. I will make up the difference for them. In your articles. You always criticise the keeping of concubines. Aren't you acting against your own principles? I do disapprove of this practice. But in view of Ah Mei's situation. I feel compelled to help her. Your generosity is overwhelming. Your stay is too short for us to show our full gratitude. Travel safely. Ah Mei will thank you in person when you return. SIX DAYS LATER I can see that Mr Su is honourable. His father is also very understanding. You are lucky. You will be married tomorrow. Your life will change. You will have to rise early to serve your in-laws. Always defer to the first wife. Be humble and never behave wilfully. ONE MONTH LATER During my travels with Mr Liang. I met very important people. It has been very formative. Mr Liang says China will not be ready to help us free ourselves from Japan for another three decades. Here are the 100 liang for Ah Mei. Many thanks. Ah Mei is truly fortunate to have found such a good family. Madame is seeking a new girl to replace her. Meanwhile. She asked me to stay a little longer. She had always promised to let me become a concubine as soon as Ah Mei would be able to replace me. THE NEXT DAY How old are you? I am ten. She has a good bone structure. But she is a little skinny. You are pregnant. Don't overtire yourself. Today Ah Mei returns to express her gratitude to you. Sir. Without your kind intervention. This could not have happened. So you leave tomorrow. When will you come back? I will assist Mr Liang with his plan for a newspaper. I may return here at any time. I have something to ask you. Last time you said that. In view of Ah Mei's situation. You felt compelled to help her. Now that Madame is asking me to stay here longer... I would like to know whether you have any plans for me. THREE MONTHS LATER THE WUCHANG UPRISING I reached Tokyo yesterday. I have already seen Mr Liang. We leave for Shanghai tomorrow. I saw the hall where they signed the treaty handing Taiwan over to Japan. Thinking of Mr Liang's poem. I couldn't help shedding a tear. "Although this place has torn my heart. "It is wrenching to leave it. "Seventeen years have passed "and the sorrowful waves still break on its shores. " Taipei. 2005 Are you okay? A TIME FOR YOUTH It's over now. Let's go. Mum, did you just call? I see. Are you feeling better? Is it ready? It's even gone cold. Thanks. You got an e-mail. Born premature. Showed up too early. I pay a high price for that. Broken bones.

Why didn't you call me back? You never pick up. You could have called back. I was sleeping. Why didn't you call to say so? I told you I was bushed. You text me and then you don't answer my call? I wanted to tell you I'd had a fit. So you can text me but not speak to me? I went to sleep right away. Still... You knew I was looking for you. Couldn't you hear your phone? No, go ahead. Couldn't you? I'd left it in vibration mode. Don't be angry. Don't be angry. If you were me, what would you think? I'll wait for you, okay?

I'll kill myself like your ex-girlfriend. The picture which you took before The smile of grey eyes May rest. Such cruel sound It's still vivid like a bird Screenplay: Chu Tien-Wen Cinematography: Mark Lee Ping-Bin Production Designer: Hwarng Wern-Ying Editor: Liao Ching-Sun Sound Designer: Tu Duu-Chih Processed by C.M.C. For the past one or two years, I have started to get more involved in politics. I'm against the manner in which history is explained by politicians. Especially how the ruling party interpret history. They're totally biased. They interpret history for their own gain. I've read about Taiwan's modern history before. I've made films of Taiwan's modern history. I was planning a way to show that the best moments of an era aren't what the politicians have told us. The stories of some characters and some scenes might not be very substantial. They just show the essence of an era. The composition and the way the film was shot are based on that thought. The reason... My story is in the first part, 1966. Then it's Huang Wen-Ying's story, 1911, followed by Peng Wen-Chung's. The two of them were directing for the first time. Peng Wen-Chun's story was meant to be in the '80s, initially. In the beginning, how we got the idea was each of us would recall the best moments of our childhood. We'd suggest these. The two of them were very busy as well. At around December last year, we had a meeting and decided that the film wasn't happening. After that, in around mid-December, the general election I was involved in was over. I had more free time and wanted to shoot this film. I reconsidered the plot and decided to change the '80s to 2005. The change was also to accommodate the actress, Shu Qi. I feel that it wasn't easy for her after Millennium Mambo. I made that decision after I discussed it with her. Nine points. The total is 60. The first story is based on personal experience. It's the period when I did my national service. The second story is set in 1911, which was my decision. 1911 and 1966 are two very important years in Taiwan's modern history. 1966 is the year of the Cultural Revolution in China, Taiwan was isolated. The third story is set in 2005. I decided on this contemporary story because... The three stories are related to Taiwan's political background. But I didn't want to show any politics in my stories. In 2004, after the presidential election, the Democratic Progressive Party came to power. The process split Taiwan in two. Hence... my thoughts about the film revolved around this issue. But I expressed it through human emotions. For the second story, the love story represents a dream of freedom. The man is always thinking about going back to China to rejoin the revolution. He'll never be committed to the courtesan. It does resemble some of my previous films but the style and composition of this part wasn't premeditated. In The Boys From Fengkuei, part of the story happened in Qi Jing. The first story also happens in the same place. I lived there for half a year, my memory of that place is very vivid, its screen time is doubled. The first story was shot in six days. It was very rushed. When you're faced with such constraints, you work quickly. You always think of the most effective way to tell the story. The second part is similar to Flowers Of Shanghai. Both stories are set in the same period. My way of shooting period film has matured. The task was relatively easy. We also filmed on location. We didn't need to build a set. The second part was shot quite quickly, in just 12 days. The third part, set in 2005, was shot in 34 days. 34 shooting days. The contemporary segment was the most difficult to shoot, it was too close to home. We had too many choices, be it locations or other things. We became indecisive and slow. The first cut of the third part was about 90 minutes. Later we trimmed it to 40 minutes. 1966 was before I went to the army, and I played a lot of snooker. At that time, Taiwan was full of snooker halls. They didn't need a licence to open one. The attendants there didn't have much to do so there were a lot of these "snooker girls" hanging around. The snooker girls were there to record the scores. They were always moving around. I wrote a love letter to one. She behaved exactly like the character in the film. She... She was very cold. When I went back later, she had gone. So I went on to another one. She told me she was sensitive. That's why I wrote to her. I wrote to her when I was in the army. When I went to look for her during a holiday, she had gone. I searched everywhere for her. When I found her, it was already very late. I had to rush back to the camp. Later... When I left the army and was enrolled at the university, I wrote to her again. She wrote back to me. When I wrote another letter again, her fianc? replied to me. She was about to get married. That was the end of that. It's too late. There aren't any more trains. What time do you need to be there? Nine o'clock. The first story, at that time, Taiwan was going through the Cold War. The Cold War started in the '50s. Taiwan had strong ties with America at that time. We got to hear a lot of American songs in the snooker halls. We didn't know what was going on outside, nothing about China. China was going through the Cultural Revolution. We knew nothing. We were blissfully ignorant. The first story was shot in Kaohsiung. It's on a small island off Kaohsiung, reachable by boat. The place is called Qi Hou, I lived there for about half a year while preparing for university. I was supposed to study for the entrance exam but I didn't, I played a lot. I fought a lot too. Of course, I didn't get in. That's a very memorable period, going to and fro on a boat. The rest of the locations are... When I was filming Three Times, I had four films in a compilation set - The Boys From Fengkuei, Dust In The Wind, A Time To Live A Time To Die, and A Summer At Grandpa's. A friend wrote the introduction for the DVD set. He went through those times too. He said those were the best times. Three Times encapsulates those periods. These periods are Taiwan's best periods. Taiwan's best periods. One interesting thing in the film is the idea of distance. If you wanted to go to the North, it wasn't easy. Now the flight takes an hour. Three hours on the motorway. The distance we felt has disappeared. That period will never come back. The best times, Three Times, will never happen again. The middle story is about a courtesan. She was sold to the brothel when she was very young. She's bought by the brothel owner and from the age of about ten years old she's trained to entertain. She's trained in every area possible. When she reaches a certain age, she's supposed to get married. She can arrange for someone to buy her out. She couldn't because of her younger sister. Her younger sister was meant to take over so she could get married. But her younger sister got pregnant and married first. The person she likes, Chen Chang, is more into revolutions. He's the intellectual type in Taiwan at that time. We were under Japanese rule at that time. He's always thinking about revolution. This relationship was doomed from the start. What he wanted was a kind of freedom, since Taiwan was ruled by Japan. THERE WAS A PRIVATE BANQUET TONIGHT THE RESTAURANT WAS FULL OF PEOPLE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MR LIANG WHO ESCAPED TO JAPAN? I chose to film this part as a silent film because I didn't have enough time for the actors to learn the language of that era. That's a kind of old Han language. They didn't have time to practise, so we resorted to silent film. I'm quite familiar with the style of silent film. You need to have exaggerated expressions, minimal dialogues and express yourself using body language. I didn't follow all that, I shot the film the way I like. They have dialogues as well. Their dialogues were based on what I'd wanted them to say. HOW OLD ARE YOU? TEN. The music... During editing, I tried... I tried a lot of different types of music. None of them were suitable. It's strange because it hasn't got sound... I tried ambient sounds, but that didn't work. Later I went to see a pianist friend. After she saw the film, she began to improvise a tune. The tune evoked a kind of feeling like the music was having a dialogue with the film. She was talking to the film following her own mood. I think that's more appropriate. When I put it together with the film, it worked. Dadaocheng is close to the Danshui River. It's one of five trading ports opened by the Anglo-French coalition after they defeated the Qing army. Keelung port is one of them. If you come in from Keelung... Danshui port is also there. You pass Danshui to reach Dadaocheng. Dadaocheng at that time was mostly occupied by tea merchants. Most of them were foreigners. We had people from all over the world. It was a prosperous port. The place we found was around there. The place is more than 80 years old. The way I feel is one's emotions are always affected by the period one lives in. Every period has a mood. The mood affects how people feel. A Chinese writer, Eileen Chang, once said, "We live under people's gazes since birth." The Chinese believe that you have to mould yourself to be a human. Every generation lives within a certain historical context, one is shaped by the context one lives in. The generation now is... The opposite now happens. First you have bodily contact and emotions and feelings come later. In 1911, the same time as Flowers Of Shanghai, there was no place for men and women to socialise. Love and feelings were kept indoors. The third story is about a girl from the internet. A young director from my company wanted to film it as a feature film. I found the background of the character very interesting. She's a young woman. She's 20 years old. She studied photography in New York. She likes photography. She uses the Lomo camera to take photographs. She even does the styling. Then she puts it on the net. She writes blogs as well. She writes about herself differently at different times. Her character is very interesting. She was a premature baby. She has a heart condition, her right eye is partially blind, she's epileptic and on constant medication. I feel that... with all this on her... She's bisexual, for a start. She has a girlfriend and a boyfriend. She's also a very intelligent girl. She composes music as well. That's the background story of the character. We later made minor adjustments to suit Shu Qi. Actually Taipei... Taipei is a complicated city. Every district is different. We found a bridge for the film which crosses the Danshui River in a somewhat shady suburb. There are a lot of pickpockets there. The next location was Wu Fen Pu, which is also on the outskirts of Taipei. It's easier for me to express - I prefer to show this part of the real Taipei. It's more chaotic here. I like chaos. The three stories show how the Chinese live their way of life. I feel that the Chinese have not been able to be themselves. It's very different from the Western culture. I feel that we haven't been able to do that. And here is the team from Three Times! The seventh film of Hou Hsiao-Hsien to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival. After Daughter Of The Nile, In The Hands Of A Puppetmaster, which won the Prix du Jury in 1993, Good Men Good Women, Goodbye South Goodbye, Flowers Of Shanghai, and Millennium Mambo which introduced us to Shu Qi. Shu Qi, the lead actress in Three Times. After working together with Shu Qi in Millennium Mambo... Shu Qi first saw Millennium Mambo in Cannes. It was a shock to her. They told me that she was crying in her hotel room afterwards. She hadn't seen herself on screen like that before. She'd only been involved in films that have many short takes. It affected her a lot. She started to put more thought into acting, more thought into her performances. We kept in touch after that. I was also curious to see how she'd perform next. I wanted her right from the start. Next we have an actor well known to festival-goers, Chang Chen. We've seen him in Wong Kar Wai's Happy Together and 2046, shown in last year's competition. Chang Chen, the whole idea started from Shu Qi. A love story must have a man in it. It's not easy to find one because... There are a lot of young actors in the Chinese film industry, both in Taiwan and Hong Kong. In terms of performance, do they have the confidence and ability to act opposite Shu Qi? I couldn't think of many. So I decided on Chang Chen. He was also free at that time. He's got the experience of working with many different directors, like Edward Yang and Wong Kar Wai. At that time he had just finished a film about a chess player with Tian Zhuang Zhuang. I felt that he was the right person for the role. Hou Hsiao-Hsien, one of the masters of Taiwanese cinema. Working with actors, the most important thing is to study their earlier performances. My judgment depends on how well I know them through that study. You'll know their form after lengthy observations and conversations. That's how I always decide on my actors. I don't rehearse the scenes over and over again. I don't have a firm idea of what I want from actors. I just give them suggestions. My scenes are normally very long. They have to improvise their own dialogue. The script isn't strict. I forgot to talk about the message of Three Times. I feel that every era has its own distinctive sense. These eras will never come again. Time keeps moving forward. One's environment and one's thoughts keep changing as well. They'll never come again. It's not that they're good times, it's because we're recalling that we call them good times. The 1966 story is about my growing up, the innocence and purity that come with it. It was a very simple time. That's how society was to me. Simple and uncomplicated. When I was filming the contemporary segment, I felt that everything was so complicated, we had too much information. These people didn't know where they stood. They didn't know where to stand as well. They wasted too much time making choices. That's just my personal view. Whether it's now, 1911 or 1966, it's just my personal view of the three periods. If you ask some youngsters now how they feel, they'll tell you that they feel good. They feel that they're the best generation. That's their feeling. That's my view. But for me, it's the period around 1966 that will remain the best in my memory.
