That, that is what I like to see. Passion! You guys, you guys fought for every square inch of the ice tonight. You let them know they were in our house! How about Justin here taking the lead as always. And Matty, Matty absolutely bleeding for it in the corners. And how about these two young guns over here, Tyson and Schultzy banking in those hard minutes at the end of the second. Let's give it over. I think we all know who this hardware goes to tonight. Let's give it over. Way to go. King for our knights! That's how the fucking warriors do it! Yeah! Harper, you know what Yeezy says, watch the throne baby. I'm coming for that crown bud. You get hit in the head too many times tonight Schultzy? Or are you still spinning from when that guy turned you inside out out there. You don't know what you're talking about bro. That there is an education bud. Playing with the big boys now. Yeah big boys, that's for sure eh? Your fucking fat ass can hardly get up and down the ice. You little bitch. Easy boys, give it a rest, Dylan have a seat. Alright as you all know I take a lot of pride in wearing the C. It means a lot more to me than just a letter on my jersey, just like coach always says, everyone has a role, and every role has it's responsibility. So I want you rookies to get up there for a minute. Look we've all been rookies before, we all know what it's like. New town, new teammates, we've all been there. You boys have shown us a lot so far. We're proud of you, and so as is tradition a proper Warriors welcome means we gotta scalp em! Come on! Mother fucker! Ahh! Won't stop now boy! Oh crying for your mother huh? Hey Wendy. Looks like this little devil has been keeping you occupied. He's good, tons of fun huh? Thank you for keeping an eye on him. Let me give you a hand with that. Thank you, that's very sweet of you. - Is Cody home? - Huh? Is Cody here? Uh no, I think he went over to Tracy's after practice. Left you all alone huh? I guess. Hey Bill. Hey, hey. Can I give you a hand with that? Sure, thank you. Just get it down to the crawl space there. Hey. Hold on, hold on, okay. The theme of the game this week is focus. If I'm gonna play on the fourth line I need to be so concentrated, so in tune with what's going on. Party. Is your head still tingling from that fucking yeti hit? No man, I'm fine. You know that ringing sound when everything is totally quiet? What do you mean? When like if you're all alone somewhere, and everything's completely silent, like nothing. Not like this cause the heater's going but if it's actually quiet like nothing. Yeah no I think I know what you mean it's just that, it's like your ears or something right? Yeah. Like that type of ringing is just you hear nothing, or something like that. Pretty much. I used to hate that when I was a kid though. Oh yeah? Yeah I just, I don't know it just really bothered me. - Huh. - Still makes me feel weird. Oh yeah? Yeah. I get really sick to my stomach and sweaty. It would feel like, I don't know like what a black hole would feel like, or something, can't really explain it. Huh. I get all freaked out and scared, so my parents would have to put on this music so I would like relax and eventually fall asleep. Oh yeah, what type of music would they play for you? Didn't matter. Anything, just like any sound, any noise just to drown out that ringing. Yeah I don't know I never, never really had any problems sleeping when I was a kid, I was always super afraid of heights actually. But yeah, never scared of the dark or anything like that. I didn't say I was cared of the dark. I don't know, I don't know. Its just that sound of like, the way I feel when I hear that sound, like nothing. I'm not trying to freak you out right now man. - You're good. - Alrighty. Night buddy. That a boy that a boy. 30 more! Oh man, you killed that man, nice work man. Thank you. What's up baby boy? Woo! Where's the knock back? Hey nobody can left your ugly ass bro. Hey you know what kid you talk too much, fucking blah blah blah. Such a fucking charity case huh? What you say? Hey you little whipping boy. Don't take it out on me. You shut your mouth or I'm gonna sick the boy on you. Listen just cause we got you from make a wish doesn't mean I'm gonna be all nice to you you fat fuck. At least I'm not from fucking Maple Ridge you little honky tonk bitch. You gotta fucking problem, where you going hey! Look at you fucking hiding. Which way you going? Why don't you take out what's in front of you? That's right. Oh hey watch it. Fuck yeah! Busted eh boys? You boys are lucky this guy's a lawyer and not a cop. Relax boys I'm on your side. These are the young princes. Oh, they make a lot bigger now a days don't they? No kidding. Wendy said she wanted to get a Rottweiler for the house or something, I said why don't you just get a couple of hockey players. They already come house trained. More or less eh boys. Don't worry I won't tell nobody. K, goodnight fellas. - Night Bill. - Night night. Bricks and mortar. These things. They're important right? They are important because we are building something here. We're building something that is great. Because at the end of the day, these things need to be built. They don't just appear, there's no magic potion, there's no shortcuts, but they have to be built. Because you're only going to get out what you put in. I mean this is why we work hard right? This is why we burn and bleed. To achieve greatness, it's like we have to take this rough hewn piece of steel and we gotta pound it, until we get Excalibur. You know that story right? The story of King Arthur and the sword. Well, here's a little history lesson for you. Because history my friends is so important. Because when you look at the history books from school or google or wherever the hell you get your history from nowadays, what's the thing that you see and remember the most? Heroes. Hm? Because last time I checked, there isn't any room in the history books for losers now is there? No sir. No. Championships, banners, trophies, all of that, that was determined by people who were writing their own history. This is the place where it happens. Not amongst the glamor or the spotlights or how many likes on your phones, no, no, no none of that. Because it's here in this place where we build our own legacy. This is where it all comes from. That's it move him move him. That's the way, work for it work for it! Who wants it more, that's it good. Move him out there. Easy easy, that's it, it's okay it's okay. Good amount of aggression there, that's exactly what we need when we're in the corners. Not get in a fight, whoever wants it most gets it. Beautiful, go. That's what I want to see from you man, show me that, show me lots of that. Next two. The nose? No let me see it. Very cute. Fucking right I'm cute boys. Man you're such a dumbass. Dude I look like I could beat the shit out of everyone. Oh yeah? That's coming from the big boy that believes in ghosts. Oh yeah, ghost whisperer over here. Alright fuck you guys cause that shit's real. So laugh all you want. What are you talking about? The hotel in Cranbrook, he thought he saw. Alright, fuck you guys. Next time I'm going to befriend the ghost and I'm gonna have him haunt every last one of you. Then we'll see who's laughing. - I got like candles out, - Yep me and my ghost friend. Grams and Gramps, back from the dead. They got walkers and dentures and shit. Howling after us biting us or something. Just use your movie method, you know when you close your eyes, plug your ears, and just know that everything's gonna be okay. It's gonna be alright. I thought that was your method with the ladies. It's true, it's true. Yo Cody buddy, hey Cody. Yeah, what's up? Do you know how to do this? Uh maybe let's see. It's damn near impossible. Fuck man I don't know. See. How do you do yours? Oh I just I got one of those clip on ones. This is ridiculous. Struggling? Hey. Do you want it any longer? I think that works. Good. Thank you. My pleasure. You guys will have to shine your own shoes though. Come on! Guys you're going on the open ice, that's not how you do it! Come on Kellan! Same. Brutal. Unbelievable. Come on! Let's go, bring it up the boards, up the boards, I'm not gonna say it again! Screaming my god damn head off here. That's it, let's go, let's go, let's go! Is everyone on fucking vacation! What the fuck is wrong with you guys huh! Can somebody please tell me what the fuck is going on out there, huh? One of you guys come on. Cause I have no fucking idea what's going on! Can one of you enlighten me please? You are fucking embarrassing yourselves tonight. You're embarrassing me, and you're embarrassing every single fucking fan that's out there, watching you. For some fucking reason you guys have decided to stay out of the corner and off the fucking boards. And on top of that they're taking liberties with our top guys and what the fuck you guys doing? Nothing! They are in our house for fucks sake. Our fucking house for fucks sake! Protect the fucking house! Will somebody wake the fuck up? Let's go warriors! Let's go warriors. Break it up, break it up boys! Let go. We're done. You're done. How am I done? You're done, hitting from behind. They're jumping on me. Let's go, you're done, you want another game? To the dressing room let's go. Wait what about this guy? To the dressing room. Hey! Dressing room or you get another game, go. What the fuck was that about? Don't worry about it. These guys are fucking all over me, I didn't know what the fuck was happening. I didn't know what was going on. - I know, it's okay. - I'm going back. - Calm down. - Move Coach get off me! Calm down, take it easy, stop it! You're not going back out there it's a bit of a cirus right now. What the fuck man, these guys are jumping all over me! Take a breath, calm down. - What happened? - Shh. What happened out there to this kid? I'm looking around he's not getting up off the ice, - what happened? - They're loading him up. Is he okay? We don't know yet, he's going to the hospital. They'll check him out. Just take it easy. Let's go get changed. Let's get you changed up, come on. Oh shit. Get you a lift home. Hey Coach, it's Tyson calling. I just wanted to get you on the phone and check in, see what's going on. I guess I'm gonna see you guys this afternoon anyways, but I never got a chance to talk to anyone since last night. Yeah, so I just wanted to check in. Just give me a shout back when you can, please thank you. Hey Tyson, come in here man. I was just wandering around downstairs there. Didn't see anybody, but I was trying to figure out what's going on. Haven't really had a chance here to talk to anybody since last night. I know, we know, well things have been pretty chaotic around here as you can imagine. Everybody's got their mind on you. It's been wacky the last 16 hours, let me tell you. But, we have a number of issues we have to weed through, with the league, and the media right. Yeah I know for sure. I'm just wondering what I can do, what I should do. Honestly probably the best thing you could do is just take it easy. Go lay low, alright. You don't need to be talking to anybody about this. Don't need to concern yourself with any of this. We got people to take care of that, right? Yep. How is he? He's in the hospital. That's all we know. Hey listen man, around here we're worried about you alright. Worried about making sure you're good to go. So just try to take it easy. You alright? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah it's just a little overwhelming. Well uh, things are getting pretty chaotic. Gotta get back to business here. Back to work, but uh. Thanks for seeing me, and taking the time. I appreciate it. Oh yeah, like I said man, just take it easy, alright? And you'll be alright. The game came to a disturbing end after a violent hit by Prince's defenseman Tyson Burr left Cheif's player Kyle Ridlowe critically injured. I don't know exactly what his condition is right now, we have not heard specifically. All I can say right now is that all of our hearts and prayers are with Kyle. This morning doctors said that Ridlowe was in stable condition but the extent of his injuries are severe. The hit left him with a broken vertebrae as well as hemorrhaging in his brain. In a moment the young man's life changed forever. It's disgusting, disgusting. How is that a hockey play? They're down in the third, down by five. Five nothing. Nobody can tell me that that's a hockey play. You scared me. Sorry about that. I don't know what to do. I feel like, I don't know. Just feel like I'm messed up or something you know? Like sick. Well there's Tylenol and all that in the kitchen. Do you need something, you can help yourself. Have any need to be inconvenienced at all. Appreciate that. Hey Tyson. Hey coach. Well it's good to see you. Yeah likewise, I gotta run but I'm sure we'll talk soon. Hey Bill take care. See you soon. Tyson, why don't you come have a seat. How you doing Tyson? Good, thanks. Tyson, this is Elliot Carr, he's an attorney. He does some specific work for the organization from time to time. Pleased to meet you Tyson. Nice to meet you. Elliot's just here to go over a few things. Some technical detail stuff. So the league is reviewing this whole incident. And we've been speaking back and forth with them, and well we've been waiting to hear back about any disciplinary action. We've been looking into our options and we've decided to make some organizational decisions based on the current situation. At this point, we're suspending you indefinitely. I know that's not what you wanted to hear, but you need to see this as an act of good faith. This is a chance for the team to show the league that we're willing to take responsibility for what happened here. - Okay. - Okay good. Now this is all just part of the process. We just have to make sure that everybody comes out alright here okay? Now to make this easier, Elliot has drafted up a statement for you for the team to release on your behalf. Um, I can read it for you now, if you like Tyson. Please, yeah please. We just want to get it out there. Be able to put it out there right away. Of course. First and foremost, I wish to extend my heartfelt thoughts and sympathies to Kyle Ridlowe and his family, his friends, and his teammates. My prayers are with each and every one of them in this difficult time. I'm profoundly sorry for both the physical and emotional hurt I have caused and I cannot forgive myself for inflicting these wounds, but I can try my very best to take full responsibility for my actions. I also wish to issue an apology to my teammates, my team, our fans and the entire city of Prince George. What happened on Friday night was not at all reflective of the values or culture of the Prince George Warriors. And I am very sorry that my individual actions have cast such a dark shadow over the organization and this city. I'm prepared to be fully accountable for what I have done and hope that through this process am able to repair some of the damage I have cost. Now this is a chance for you to get out in front of this thing okay? We can put this out there for you, and all you need to do is step back okay? You don't need to talk to anyone, or do anything alright? Alright. I didn't mean for that to happen. Hey, we're not here to judge the way you play the game, okay? We're just here to help. I know. Thank you guys. Guess I just feel bad you know? I know you do. And this, this says you do, okay? Yeah. How long is indefinite? We'll have to wait and see. Okay. Nice talking with you Tyson, take care. Thank you. We'll see you again soon. You bet Coach. Hey Bill. Hey. Listen, I've spoken with Wendy over the last couple of days here, after discussing things we feel at this point it would be appropriate for you to find another place to stay. I don't really have anywhere to go. Look, we're not trying to complicate things here but, this is our home. I got priorities to our son. And with that in mind, I don't feel comfortable having you around here. Yeah, I understand that. I uh, I'll figure something out, I will. I'm not telling you to pack your bags right this minute and get out on the street tonight but, by tomorrow you need to have your situation sorted. That's fair. Like I say, my responsibility is to my family. I don't want people coming around knocking on my door and I don't want to explain what the commotion is to my son, you know? He's just a kid, he's young, he's impressionable. Yeah I know. He needs positive role models around here and not, this other stuff you know. Yep. So I'm a fair person you know but, my family always comes first, always. Always you know. Yeah, I know. I respect that. Hey brother. Hey brother. Alright, so that's you. Perfect man, thank again. That's alright. So you just gonna chill for a bit, or what cause we gotta head to the rink pretty quick here. Yeah I'll probably step out or something. Well if you want to shower you know where it is right? Yeah I know, just back there. - Cool. - Cool man. Yeah I'm gonna get going, talk to you later. - See you later buddy. - Yeah see you. Take it easy okay? Yeah man, have a good one. Dude for real, she's the best. Tron fucking broke. Oh my god, Tronda's fucking broke. Danger cat. Is a danger cat. Get any refills for you guys? Good thanks. And the second one when they go to the screamer. Yeah that's the one! As a kid I was up there, I remember, fucking knees shaking, scared out of my mind. After my grandma when, it went straight all the way up the sign. Granny. It was so bad that I puked, shit and puked. I know man I'm such a pussy. There's your change. Thank you sweetie, oh it's right this time. I'd wash your hands first. What's that buddy? I wasn't talking to you disgraceful piece of shit. Hey fuck you! Whoa, whoa! Fuck you! Hey hey hey! Get off my property! Fuck you sack of shit. Fuck you! Burr, woo! You know next time I'll let you knock him out alright. That's right baby, damn that was a good one. Fuck yeah! Hey man. What's up man? Not much. Where's Derek? He's already gone. Is that right. Yeah, coach wants to see us both earlier today so. You gotta bounce. Yeah man. See you later. Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. So what's your plan? He's gonna work. Yeah, I'm gonna go see Hank tomorrow, see if he's got any shifts for me over at the slaughter house. Good. I'll also get you working on the old property. Haven't any time to get to that. Gotta rip down that fence. Get all the wrecks off the acreage and finally tackle that house, finally. Yeah for sure. I'll stay busy. It's probably just going to be for a little while anyway. Well it's nice you're home. Hey Coach it's Tyson calling, I was just hoping to have a chat with you when you get a moment. I've been taking some time to straighten myself out here and yeah I'm really looking forward to getting back and contributing and just being a part of the team, helping you guys out. Yeah, just looking forward to getting back out there. So if you could give me a shout back when you get a chance that would be really great, alright thank you. Gotta clear everything out of here. May as well start in the living room. Look at this, garbage. And the bathroom I guess, stinks. It's crap. Keep anything of value, metal, copper, toss it in the truck. Whatever. Whatever you can salvage. Thought of tackling this eyesore just gives me a headache. Anyway I'll talk to the guy and see what day the can actually take her down. Alright. Just, do the best you can. Yep. Alright. At one point she had two kids and I guess she was jealous of me sleeping. I didn't get much sleep, I had to work the next day for Popolson, and I was driving from Prince George to Smithers on a coastal run. Popolson's a good company. I got a buddy work for them. It's not too bad. I'd say good good. Yeah? I told Jack, he decided to retire. Oh okay. Harold was in order but Jack took off. Right? So anyway I was driving form Houston to Smithers thinking I wasn't that tired, ended up doing a little bit of the blinks, going down the road. Whoa whoa, you gotta come out and play hockey tonight man. Don't forget they guys gotta see you. I know, Phil was saying something about it. Yeah, I might do that. Yeah, new age hockey. Skates with a walker. I'll have my head up. You'll like it, they're a good bunch of guys man, you'll like it. No I mean I went to one game, it was a gift. I don't know, I'd rather watch it on TV. I went to a Buffalo Sabers game growing up, versus Toronto and then I like being at home. Hey, somebody come here! I want to talk to somebody! Hey! I'm waiting here, come here! Hey! Hey! Somebody hey! I know you can hear me! I know you can hear me! Come here and talk to me! This is my house. This is our home. We built this place, and you need to show some god damn respect for that. You just don't seem to get it do you? You have all these people out there bending over backwards trying to help you. And you just keep shoveling shit back in their faces. Do you have any idea what we've been though because of you? Any idea at all? The embarrassment, the fucking humiliation! Do you? That's a question! You need to learn to take some responsibility for you actions. You're not a god damn child. Get your shit together. Please dial 374. You've reached Coach Weller, please leave a message, thank you. Is the window for style points here or what? No it was just an accident. I say you just chop the roof altogether man and rock a little convertible action you know? Oh I'm on a budget. Tyson. Tyson, Eric. Nice to meet you. What happened to your hand there bud? It's like um. You know man don't even worry about it. Shit happens you know. Yeah shit happens. So you from around here? Yep, I was away for awhile but now I'm back for a little bit. Well you picked the proper spot for a vacation huh? Yeah. See you back in there. Alright. Ah, fuck! Ah! Oh fuck. What's up man? Hey. So you get that window fixed? Not yet, nope. Gonna take her in sometime soon. Yeah I could have a look at it if you like? Do you do that kind of stuff? I dabble, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Yeah. How'd you end up here? I was working a rig about 150 clicks north of here, I was just sick and tired of the rat race. Had big plans you know. Shacked up with the old lady, I wanted to take that extra step and get a house going and maybe get a couple little young ones running around. Nine months in she went and started a whole new life without me so. Shit man. Kind of shook up. Sucks. What are you gonna do? At least I got out of there, it was such a dark place, you need to stay focused, stay positive you know? Take the good with the bad you know? Yep. Should probably get back to work huh? Yeah you should get back in there. Hey! Yeah it totally seems doable man. I mean I've never done anything like this before, but doesn't seem impossible. That'd be wicked man. How much would you charge for that? I don't know like a hundred bones maybe, you wouldn't have to cover much after parts and stuff so. Definitely. I could place an order on Monday. Yeah. I would probably take a couple of weeks. Rolling with the Saran wrap until then so. Cool man, well you wanna come in for a beer? Yeah, I could have one. So you found the bathroom alright in my mansion? You should see the fucking place I'm working on. What you got a little rental job on the go? Yeah, it's basically like this scrap job on one of our properties. Just trying to pull whatever we can out of there you know. Collect from the floors, walls. Most of it's rusted to shit. Woods all finished but there's a few things. And after that we're just gonna knock it down for pasture. Total salvage mission eh? Mm hmm. Nice, has it been in your family for years? Yeah, it's my Godparents. But no one's lived there after my Grandpa died. It's been empty for ages. You grew up there as a tyke? I spend a lot of time there when I was younger. But it's like early memories you know? Never really met my Grandma. My Grandpa died when I was really young. And him and my Dad had this weird kind of thing. It was kind of old school military guy right. So they had their problems I guess. So after he died we didn't really hang out there too much. It's like a place that's always been left alone. Out of sight our of mind kind of thing. Mm hmm. So how'd you grandpa pass? Throat cancer. Throat cancer eh? Yep, rough shit. Yeah. I can totally relate. I was in the hospital and I had this young guy beside me that had a trach, and his breathing would be fine and then about a half an hour into it you could hear a you know it was the flem buildup so they would come in with a tube and stick it in his trach suck out all this flem. Yeah. And meanwhile I'm just like, shut the fuck up! I'm trying to sleep, go die somewhere else you know. Just being totally delirious of the fact. And two days in, the next night, following night, wake up in the morning and I'm usually woken up by this suction of this tube and whatever and I look over and the bed was gone. I ask the nurse and I yell nurse, what happened to the little kipper her. And the nurse it like yeah, didn't make it, you know and whatever, throat cancer got him. And I was just like, what? I'm being me being six years old, I'm like holy fuck man, that's heavy. Dying, he just died right there man What you end up in there for? I actually like, I was in a coma for two months. No way. Yeah dude, I survived the coma, and yeah it was pretty heavy. My mom organized this parade in Fort Mac when I was living up there and the theme was cowboys versus indians. Well of course me being an indian I came prepared with my bustles you know, my pow wow regalia, my gear you know, totally jiving. And then all of a sudden, it stops. And we're like what's the hold up and we look over there. Here like someone was, there was some holdup. So I just kick back, waving at the same people doing whatever, and then it violently shook and I went flying eight feet off this platform. Right onto my head, like smacked my dome and everything. The driver behind us in the, passed like the following, 18 wheeler didn't even see me and it straight just ran my leg over, crushed it in seven place. Oh fuck. I was unconscious you know. God damn. Gretzky came and saw me in the hospital, you know, Gretzky straight up showed up. The great one. I'm all tubed up like totally, like sheets across they way, full of tubes and everything. There's Gretzky puts down a home jersey and an away jersey and that's the photo I have. Smiling for the camera while he's autographing these jerseys and I'm fucking, I got a little teddy bear stuffed under my arm, I'm fucking out of it you know? I'm gonna go grab another beer alright. I'm fucked up man. I'm just fucked up man. You alright there buddy? Yeah, I just fucked up. You'll be alright man. Just fucked up you know. I was just drinking too much, fucked up you know. You'll be fine bro. Yep. No worries. Everything's gonna be fine man. Yep. Do you need a ride on Thursday? No that's alright I can drive. Do you want a ride? No thank you. Okay. How's everything looking up at the house? I didn't have a chance to get up there today but the house is looking good. Things be, they'll take it down on Wednesday. K. That sounds good. Thank you for that, work. Appreciate it. Yep, no problem. If you need something else just let me know. There's always something. Yep. Yeah we're all set back here. Come in. There she is. Lovely to see you. Are you here to collect Alex? If I can pry him away. Good how are you. Let me take this little guy. Let me get your jacket for you. How you doing? Pretty good. Where you putting these? Oh, I'll grab that. Here can you take him for a sec. Sure. Well come on in, have something to eat. Lots to drink in there too, help yourself. Careful man. Now I understand there has already been a private settlement reached between the parties representing Mr. and Ms. Ridlowe, and the Prince George Warriors? Yes, that is correct sir. Alright, so that leaves us with the matter of Mr. Burr, and the liability of his part regarding his actions with relation to the adverse impact that those have had on the respective parties represented here today. I would like to remind all parties that this is simply a preliminary hearing, however you are welcome to submit statements at this time should you choose to. Mr. Howard, I understand that you would like to do so. Yes, your Honor. We feel that it is imperative in this situation to recognize the responsibility of the individual. And that the individual's actions, taken on their own, were done so without the direction, endorsement, or support of the Prince George Warriors. We feel that this is specifically vital in context of the character of the individual. In this case we have a young man who, since the incident on which we are focused, has been held in police custody. What this would seem to indicate is a pattern of violence.
