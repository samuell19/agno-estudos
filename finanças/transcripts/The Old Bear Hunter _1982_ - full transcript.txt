Move it! And shout louder! Starring Kô Nishimura Oh mountain gods, send us a lot of big bears. We are begging you, oh mountain gods. Oh mighty mountain gods, we thank you for this game. Let it multiply innumerously. Be careful. The way you flay an animal will determine the size of the hide you get. Look, it's Heizo! He's coming back empty-handed again. Yeah... It's been a while since he last hunted an animal. He must be still hoping to hunt that killer bear. Welcome, Heizo! Are you coming back from the mountains? Accept a piece of bear meat as our gift. I don't need it. Directed by Toshio Gotô I'm home. Dad, we were worried. It's been a week. Well, I'm sorry. Dad, what's wrong with grandpa? He gets like this in autumn. Roams the mountains looking for his bear. Add the salt. When will it stop? He drove your mother and grandmother to a grave like this. It's not true! He did. Whenever it's time to harvest, he runs off. And we have to do all the work. But people live off hunting, too. Hunting alone isn't enough to survive. It seems to be enough elsewhere. Elsewhere, but not here. Now stop arguing. Shiro! Give me a paw! And stop hopping, it's bad for you. You're going to have puppies soon. Yeah, like that. But dogs aren't allowed in school. So don't even think about it. I said no. Father, I have to go now. Don't drink too much, you're not young anymore. I'll be transferring money into your account, as usual. Take care. Look well after the children. You're the only one they have here. - Did you remember to take the bear bile? - Yes, I did. - Yuriko, I'm off! - Bye! I heard last night... a huge bear appeared out of nowhere and broke chestnut trees in the park. Really? They saw him this morning, too. Where was our famous Heizo? He could have killed him with one shot. Where are you heading, by the way? - To work, in the city. - I see. Dad, promise me it's the last time. I wish it was that simple. Dad! Dad! Bring me a present from the city! I will. Now, go to school! Dad! - Should I stop? - Keep going. The train leaves at 8.15. I can't be late. - Just for a minute? - I said, keep going. Taro, if you're sleepy, go to bed. Taro, wake up. Shiro has whelped. Really? They're so cute! Out of my way! From Heizo Sekiguchi Real bear bile. It's terribly bitter. Our teacher has had stomachache since yesterday. Nothing seems to help. He's been taking the wrong medicine, that's all. Shut up, idiot. Bear bile will help him. It's good for anything. Like what? I don't know. But my granddad says it's good for anything, and he knows what he's talking about. - Even for headache? - Anything at all. And bear brain even helps with stupidity. Ground bones cure asthma. Cartilage gives strength. The teacher's coming! Teacher, here's some medicine from grandpa. Thank you. Take as much as you want. I'll just cut off a small piece. - You have to take it before meals. - I don't feel like having a meal now. Class, we'll have Natural History instead of Language today. Let's go to the canteen! This, kids, is dried bear bile. Our ancestors valued this medicine very highly. Bear bile looks like any other bile. Fraudsters have taken advantage of it by selling fake medicine. Quiet! Sorry, teacher. Does anyone know how to distinguish bear bile from, say, wild boar bile? Anyone else? Nobody? Go ahead, Taro. Bear bile starts spinning in boiling water. Exactly. Well, let's see if this one starts spinning. Wow! - Here you go. - Teacher, why does it happen? If I knew, I'd be a Nobel Prize laureate. Yuriko, their eyes opened! They are so cute! Don't be afraid. Look, there's a little one. It's twice as small as the others. You're so sweet. Hey, get out of the way, bullies. Let your little brother have some. Well, kid, all the milk is yours now. Good boy. The train to Osaka is arriving at platform 4. The train to Tokyo is arriving at platform 7. Here you go. Not a single mark. Excellent job, as usual. Looks like I'll have to pay a lot, Heizo. And it comes to... 180 thousand yen. Is it okay with you? - It is. - We have a deal then. Bear and marten pelts are the most popular this year. - How much is marten? - About 20 or 30 thousand. I'll get you some marten as well. Bears are more expensive, though. Why doesn't a hunter like you hunt bears anymore? Maybe it's not my business, but... bear skins have been small recently. It's like there are no big animals left. - Taro, let's go. - See you next time. Sake, finally! - Look at you, you're a real beauty. - Thank you. Time flies so fast. Not so long ago, you carried him around in your arms. - Let me pour you some. - Thank you. And now he's such a big boy. You're going to grow old, too, one day. But not until I hunt my bear. - I'll ask him. - Don't be stupid. Are you that famous bear hunter? Behave yourself! People are celebrating. Quiet, woman! I have a right to ask. I'll tell you straight. You're wrong in the head, Heizo. 2m 40cm, you say? Bears of that size don't even exist. You say, one like that attacked you? Do you take us for fools? I'm from the Forestry Commission, we're responsible for every hunter. If there's a beast like that, we have to declare the forest a no-go area. Enough, you're drunk. Eat up before it goes cold. Everyone's laughing at you behind your back! Grandpa! Heizo! Heizo! A bear killed my cow, about half an hour ago! Everyone says, you're the one to go to. You're the only one who can handle it. Where did he go? Judging by the tracks, he went to the mountains. Hello, Heizo! This is no ordinary bear. It's huge. Look at the way he broke the cow's neck. It's him. - The one that attacked you? - No doubt. It's the only one in the area capable of killing a cow. Heizo! It's about to start snowing. We have to go home before the road gets blocked. It's dangerous to go to the mountains now. Dear villagers! Although, the bear is out of the valley by now... we ask you to stay at home, for safety reasons. Do not go out alone. Tomorrow, children will be taken to and from school in groups. - We're packed like sardines. - Yeah, there are too many of us. When bears are not hibernating, they eat whatever they can find. Usually, they eat cows, but they like something softer for dessert. Don't touch me! Taro, have you asked you grandfather to kill that bear as soon as possible? What if he can't? He's been killing nothing but hares lately. Besides, he's old. Shut up! No one except him can handle this bear. Dad, how are you doing in the city? Grandpa, sister and me are okay. Thank you for the tape recorder. It's the one I've been dreaming about. Thank you again. Everyone sends you greetings. Chibi, you pissed in the bed! Damn it. I'll have to change it. Otherwise, you won't be allowed to sleep here anymore. - Good morning. - Morning. I'll be away for 3 or 4 days. Are you going to hunt that bear? Yes. Do you have enough bullets? I'll have three shots. What if you need more? I'm only interested in one particular bear. Grandpa, wouldn't it be more prudent to take the new rifle? The new rifle isn't suitable for that bear. Why not? Because it shoots 200 meters. With the sight, even 500 meters. Plus, it's multi-charge. It's like a machine gun. It would be a disgrace for me. But yours is a single-shot rifle. You'll have to reload it. That's right. But that bear is a gift from mountain gods. If you set out to hunt him, you put your life at stake. - Three shots are enough. - What if they can't kill him? Then he'll kill me. What is it, Shiro? Go look. It's close. Come on, we're not here to play! Here you go! We can start. There are so many of them! Great catch! We got lucky. Quick, before they hide. Look! This fish is huge! It's going to be a heavy load. Takashi, let's go to the mountains and sell it to a restaurant. - They'll give us a few thousand. - No way! Hold on! Wait for us! We're coming, too! - What is it? - Go without me. - Taro, wait! - It's off, anyway. Great. We missed the bus because of that idiot. Grandpa, the man from the neighboring village is here! I know. I'm waiting for him. - Which puppies are you going to give him? - The ones he likes. - Even two of them? - Of course. The male dog owner can have a half. Shiro, quiet! Come here, everyone. These are good puppies. I'll take this one. - Sell the rest of them. - Are you sure? Chibi, where are you going? Oh, this is one is no good at all. Yes, it's way too small. It doesn't matter. The others will sell like hot cakes. Well, you're the only one left now. Don't worry, I'll take care of you. Grandpa, when Chibi grows up, you can go hunting with him. I doubt it. He's too small and weak. It's good if I can train him to hunt a hare or a pheasant. Even a bigger dog, seeing a bear, runs away with its tail between its legs. What if you spend a lot of time training it? One of a hundred... ... is born to hunt a bear. - Look, it's Taro's father! - Taro, your dad is there! Where? Yes, it's him! What is it? When you're punished, you stand still and keep quiet. Suzi, read it aloud. - Teacher, can I speak? - What is it? My dad's back! I see now. Well, what are you waiting for? Go to him. Thank you! Dad! Dad! You've got so big! - Grandpa! - Quiet! It's serious. She's got twisted stomach. I'm afraid surgery won't help. She's quite old now. It'll be torturing her for nothing. It'd be different if this was a cow or a horse, but I don't have much experience with dogs. How long will she last without surgery? - I doubt it'll live till tomorrow. - Is that so? Well, thank you. Thank you, doctor. Goodbye. Taro, take Chibi for a walk. She needs to rest. Taro, better come here and help me. Dad, is Shiro really going to die? Looks like it. But she'll have left behind good puppies. - I'll give my fish to Shiro! - Me, too! Shiro! You've saved my life so many times. But I can't save yours. Thank you for everything. Grandpa, this is for Shiro. Leave her alone. She doesn't need anything from us anymore. What do you mean? Such dogs have dignity. They don't want people to see them die. She'll go to the mountains to die. We have to let her do it. Hello. I'm happy to see famous Heizo in action. - Would you like to practice, too? - Not today. How could you kill so many bears with this old piece of junk? - How are you? - I'm fine. - Maybe, you should get some rest? - No. I just want to get it over with. He missed so many shots. He's not like himself today. He used to be famous for his marksmanship. Old age. We're all going to grow old someday. One more? And for you, Heizo? Help yourselves. Woman, bring something better for Heizo. Go bring our home-made sake. Here you go. Here you go. Listen, Heizo... ... isn't it time for you to retire? You're not the same as you used to be. You hardly managed to score enough. Don't worry. A bear is bigger and closer. Hunting isn't the only thing in the world. - You can find something else to do. - I can't. I have to get even first. Are you talking about that bear again? Exactly. Forget about it. Maybe he's long gone by now. No, he's here. Chibi, come here! Grandpa, come get something to eat! Dad, don't overstrain yourself. You have to eat and take breaks. Grandpa doesn't take heat very well. No, he's just old. He's not as strong as he used to be. It's Kakuchi's rifle. Did you recognize it by the sound? It was a blank shot. He's training his dog. Sit! Down! Down! Fetch! Taro, do you really think Chibi can be trained to hunt a bear? Let's try, at least. Come on, shoot. Come on. Shoot! Chibi, fetch! Hey, where are you going? It's just a toy! Taro, I'm tired of this. I climb up and down like a fool without any result. Have patience. He did grab it last time. Yes, he grabbed it and then he dragged it to the bushes. He's a stupid dog. If a person behaves like that, people say he's retarded. Why did you look at me while saying that? You're retarded yourself when it comes to arithmetics. Yes, but not that retarded. What do you think training is for? To get better. Alright. Get ready. Shoot! Chibi, fetch! Yes! He did it! Chibi, bring it over here! Good boy! See? He can do it. I've always believed in you. We have to carry on. Chibi, over here! Taro! - Throw it! - Okay! Chibi, fetch! Now come back to me! Sit! Heel! Sit! Sit! Down! Wait! Here! Good boy. Once again. Sit! Heel! Wait! Sit! Down! Wait! Here you go. Good boy. Chibi! Yuriko! Where's Chibi? Grandpa took him to the forest. This is a bear. Sniff. Now attack! This is a bear's paw. Remember it. Take that! Attack! Take that! Take that! Grandpa! Stop it! Attack! - Grandpa, don't! - Go away! Attack! Come on, Chibi! Attack! Grandpa, won't it hurt him? It's so bitter. He'll have to eat it. It's a test. Bear fat heals wounds and frostbite. Yes, but it hurts so much. Chibi, eat it. Understood? I said, eat it. Of course, no one would eat it of one's own will. Come here. Eat it. You'll have to, whether you want it or not. There's no other way. Wow, it's sends shivers down my spine. He's got the blood of a bear hunter. Now I can see that. 21st Annual Hunting Club Dog Contest Hello. Taro, read what it says here for me. Let me fill it in. Here's my form. - Are you Heizo's grandson? - I am. - And who's taking part in the contest? - Me. That's out of the question. If something happens, we'll be responsible. It's not a children's game, you know. Now get out of here. What did you say? Oh, Heizo himself! Glad to see you! Welcome to the contest. Taro, don't be afraid. Look confident. Composure is vital for success. Yes, I know. What are you doing? What do you care? Girls don't get to know. Is it a big secret? Get lost. We're preparing the dog for the contest. Yeah, right. Number 10, Kakuchi Nichimura. It's enough. You get a point. Number 11, Taro Sekiguchi. Chibi, attack! Taro, come on! Chibi, attack! It's enough. You don't get a point. - What a disgrace. - I said he was a lousy dog. It was a disgrace, wasn't it? But we'll keep training him, right? Of course, we will. I believe in him. He'll manage. He'll become a real bear hunter? Heizo! This goddamn bear is back! This time, he killed a girl! Heizo! I beg you, revenge my daughter! Please! My dear girl... She's grieving. No wonder. - Did anyone see him? - No, no one. But, no doubt, it's the same killer bear. I want to gather people and hunt him down. We haven't found anything. It's time to go. Yes, go home. He's full, he's not going to attack now. I'll go tell everyone. Kokichi, give me one hunter. I'll go check the area. Heizo, let's not go any further. KILLER BEAR VILLAGE PANIC-STRICKEN FIVE SERIOUSLY INJURED FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO TRACK DOWN BEAR BEAR KILLS TWO COWS VILLAGERS AFRAID TO GO OUT Dear wife! May your love be with me to protect me. I'm going on what may be my last hunt. I'm wearing the clothes you once made for me. Well, what is it? Go. Grandpa! Grandpa, take me with you! Please! I want to see you hunt him. Go back home! Do you hear me? No way! I can't take you with me this time. Why not? Because the mountains are dangerous right now. Now turn back. No! Grandpa, you know yourself that you have poor eyesight. I'm worried about you. I can't take you with me. It will make the mountain gods angry. How long are you going to stay there? Until you turn into a piece of ice? It's going to take 3 or 4 days. I know. I warned Yuriko and the teacher. Hold on! We'll take shelter over there. Hold tight. Our lives depend on it. It's so quiet here. Yes. Not a single noise. The bear must be far away now. He's not going to run around in this kind of weather. He's somewhere close. This is the last cookie. And for you, Chibi. We have only soy beans left now. I have some candy. Grandpa... Taro, what is it? Don't fall asleep. Taro, what's wrong? Wake up! There's not enough air. Now breathe. Taro, wake up! Do you hear me? I'm sleepy... You can't sleep now. There's enough air now. Breathe. I reached the soil. Here, it's edible. Try it. Grandpa... We're not going to die here, right? We can't. Who's going to kill the bear then? Grandma used to sing this song. Yes. Taro, look! Grandpa! Grandpa! A blizzard is coming again. - Do you hear it? - I don't hear anything. We have to go down. We mustn't be caught in a blizzard here. Quiet! Chibi! Quiet! Grandpa, I'm scared! Don't be. Just don't move. Grandpa! There he is. The wind is changing. We have to be walking upwind. He's too far away. He's not letting us near him. He wants to lure us to the mountains. Stay here. And don't move. Grandpa! You've been waiting for me, too. Grandpa! Taro! Come, help me cover him with snow. Aren't we going to take the hide to the village? No. He belongs to the mountains. Gods sent him here. And we're sending him back to them. THE END
