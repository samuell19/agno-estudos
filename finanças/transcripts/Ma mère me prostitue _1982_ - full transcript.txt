My Mother Prostitutes Me Gigi, phone call for you. - Yes, honey, it's me. - Where are you, Mom? I'm at "The Jokey". It's a nightclub. I'm with Marc. - Yes, I get it. - See you later. Bye, Mom. See you. Get ready. Where were you? Come on, we're leaving. I said, we're leaving! What's wrong with you, Marc? I don't like being taken for a fool. Got it? - What's wrong with you, Marc? - Shut up! - Shit, we're out of gas. - Great... We're out of gas at two o'clock in the morning in the middle of the countryside. What a night... First you got into a jealous rage. And now you're running out of gas in the middle of the countryside. Shit, shit, shit, shit! Please, sirs, do you have gas? - We can help you. Right, Charlie? - Yes. You have a beautiful wife, old man. Calm down, boy. She's one hell of a babe. I like you, honey. It's true, I like you a lot. Come here! What are you doing? You're crazy! Don't move, fat ass! Don't worry, your babe is in good hands. Stop it, you bastards! Lie down! Calm down! Come on, defend yourself. I'll wear you down. Swallow it, come on! Enjoy this sexual education lesson. Come on, swallow it! Don't try anything. Come on, suck it. Hey, she likes it! Bastards! Suck it, come on. Look fatty, she's asking for more. You don't know how to fuck this girl properly. Women love the unexpected. You bastards, you'll pay for this! Bastards! Look, fatty, she likes it. You slut. My turn now. Come here. Let go of me. I'm gonna fuck her ass. Yeah. So, old man, you see how it's done? Your cum! Now move, you slut! We've seen enough of you. Here. Marc! Marc! Are you angry with me? Marc! Marc, wait! Marc! Do you know what he did? He emptied the closets. He took the checkbooks and my jewelry. Even the mink coat he bought me in Las Vegas. Do you understand? I called the bank. He removed me from the account. I'm penniless. I have to pay Gigi's school fees. What will happen to me, Marie? I don't know how to do anything. Oh, you know, there are many ways to make a living for an attractive woman like you. And Gigi is such an adorable nymphet... Paris doesn't lack wealthy persons interested in youth... Oh, Marie! I can't believe you thought about something like that. As far as I am concerned, I can't do anything for you. Marc is a business acquaintance of my husband. Besides, the person I was waiting for has arrived. I get it. You refuse to help me. Of course, If you'd give me Gigi for one night, things could be different. I'll tell you one thing, Marie. Even in hard times, there are things well-educated women would never do. Goodbye. The true morality is a question of money. Isn't that right, Greg? Well, yes. It's all right, Mom, we'll get by. Like you did before you met Marc. It was fifteen years ago. I got used to my new lifestyle since then. Don't worry, I saw that they were looking for dancers here. - Look, it's written here. - You're sure? Come on, come with me. Please, have a seat. Please understand, sir. We've just suffered a tragedy that left us penniless and... I understand, ma'am. Stand up, let me have a look at you. Stand up, please. Stand up, ma'am! Turn around. Sir, I think you're mistaken. I came for my daughter. - Gigi, come here. - Yes, Mom. - My daughter can dance. - And I'm very good at it, sir. - Is your kid at least eighteen? - Yes, she is. I'm old enough to vote. You want to see my identity card? No, it's okay. We'll see that later. Get undressed. - Hold on a second. - What's wrong, Mom? What's wrong? Your girl must take off her clothes so I can see her naked. Stop it, Gigi! You can't undress in front of this man. Why not, Mom? He just wants to see how I look. Nothing unusual about that. Ah, I understand. You're looking for naked dancers. It's a peep show, not a convent. Our clients want to see beautiful girls exposing themselves completely naked with their thighs wide spread. Gigi, let's leave right now! No, Mom. First ask him how much it pays? Good question, little girl. She's not stupid. Well, for your daughter, ma'am... A beauty like you could make a lot of money. See, Mom. Especially if she agrees to go to a private booth. Our clients are generous towards cuties like you. Come on, dance! Get undressed, let me see. No need to take off your skates. What? So you don't want me to dance? Oh, it's alright. And the money? Two or three thousand per day if she works hard. Well, it's well paid. But, sir, it's not a job for a girl from a good family. Ah, don't worry, ma'am, we have very strict rules. Our clients are allowed to look but it's absolutely forbidden to touch our dancers. I have my reputation to uphold. This is not a brothel! - When can she start? - Well, the sooner the better. I could start right away. That way you'll be able to pay Mr. Bison, the piano teacher. Why not? I'll walk you out, ma'am. Wait for me here, little girl. Great! Don't worry, ma'am, she'll be out before 10 pm. - Alright, I'm counting on you. - You can. Come here, little girl. Get over here. - Get on your knees here. - Yes. You know, the rules are for the clients, not for the manager. Of course, it's normal. Well... You know what it is? Of course. Well, move your mouth closer and take it. This little girl is very good. Is she new? Is she available for a private session? It depends on how much you're willing to pay. You bad girl, you have a stomach ache, huh? The doctor will treat you. Look in the mirror how I'm treating you. Look, naughty girl. You're tickling me, Doctor. I'm gonna put it in your ass, you little insolent. Oh, it feels funny. Look at yourself. You feel the water flowing, huh? Oh, it feels... Oh, it feels warm. Get dressed now. Oh, why? It's already over? Look, it's great, isn't it? Here it is, Mom. For my first working day, it's not so bad. That's good, darling. But don't tell anyone about your job. Do you understand? But why, Mom? It's a normal job. The hottest show in Paris. Come on! - For the Russian. - Thank you. - I have new clients. - Ah, how much? 2500 for me. That'll do. When? Tomorrow night at your home. - Your advance. - Thank you. Hey! - And my commission for the English? - After they pay me, alright? Okay. Come discover the most beautiful girls in Paris. Hey, sir! Look at those babes. They have great bodies, huh? Come on, it's open to anyone. It's just behind there. Wait, I'm going with you. I want you to take off your dress and bend over so I can spank you. Oh, it's shocking, sir! Little misses always present themselves butt-naked to receive the caning. In that case... Turn around. Spread your legs wider, miss. Alright, sir. You're going to count the hits up to ten. In English, of course. It's the best way to learn. Okay, sir. Shocking! Is this a proper way to treat a little french girl? I'll teach you to whip little girls! Sit down, miss. Lie down! Look, sweetie. Look those little things. Leave Nestor alone, dirty girl! Look at my boss! Oh yes! Show her your cum. Nice girls like pigs. Oh yes, my cum. When should I come back for my next lesson? It won't be necessary, lady. Sir give only one lesson per person. Mom has invited Russian friends to entertain me. She's nice. Lovely mamoshka. We must see a comrade. Duty first. Then we'll come back to see mamushka. Keep this precious semen. Here is a little present for minushka. Bottle of sperm. Good for hair, for everything. Natural product guarantee. Catherine the Great used to wash her hair every day with sperm shampoo. Mom doesn't know I have a boyfriend. A boy I met at the peep show. Patrick. He's so cute. And he is very successful with the girls of the peep show. Hello, Gigi. - Alright? - Okay. Oh, Mom! A movie director noticed me. Oh, that's nice. Mr. Marcadet is an important person in the movie industry. - It's great, isn't it? - Yes, of course. - He's going to screen test me. - I'm glad for you. But I want to know more about him first, darling. Well, Gigi, I'm waiting. - Who is that boy? - What boy? - The one from earlier. - Ah! Patrick. You know, darling, nowadays, virginity is rare. - It can be worth a lot of money. - I imagine so, Mom. Patrick will wait, but not too long. You promise? I promise. I'll negociate you as soon as possible. Don't tell anyone and let me handle this. As usual, Mom. Are you interested? Now tell me, is it a deal? And you will be present? So what are you talking about? Listen... Blondie! The door! The door! Ah, here comes the adorable Gigi. The daughter of my friend, Val?rie. Do you remember, Greg? This woman, full of principles. Of irreproachable morality. Yeah. Come here, honey. This little girl is so cute, don't you think, Greg? She is magnificent. Well, I'm giving her to you, Greg, as a present. Well, Greg... I'm giving you Gigi for your birthday. An exceptional present. Very nice. Let's see this virgin more closely. Blondie! Truly exceptional. Indeed, she seems to be a virgin. It will be better when you will deflower her, Greg, my love. Yes, that's it. Come on. I hope we made a lot of money. Quite a lot, but you know, I have expenses. And now I have to dress you like a real woman. Ah, great! With silk panties and lots of sexy lingerie? Yes, darling, anything you want. Now that you've become a woman... I love you, Mom. I'm gonna try on the whole store! You can put your clothes back on. Not this one. - It's one of mine. - Precisely. Well, I spent a little fortune. You're so good to me, Mom. Now I'm going to become a big movie star. Yes. Lift her butt and spread her thighs so we can see. Come on! Spread it wider so we can start shouting. Zoom in on that. Come on! An actress must know how to do everything. Sucking, masturbating and everything else. Come on, my little Gigi! Like that, Mr. Marcadet? Yes, very good. Very, very good. Come on, Coco. Now zoom in on her ass. There. There, that's it. There, very good, kids. The best and sluttiest girl will hit the jackpot. Ah, these kids are great. There. Don't hurry too much. Yes. There. Very good. That's perfect. Bravo, my darlings. "Action, action", as John Ford would say. May the best girl win. The best cocksucker and naughtiest girl will be chosen for the movie. Don't forget it. There, that's it. Do it right. Very good. Come on. That's good, Gigi. - Gigi? - Yes? Come on, sweetie. You're the best. Come on, show them what you can do! Very good. There, just like that. There, yes. Perfect. Now speed up the rythm! There. Yes, Gigi, you're the best. You're really the sluttiest girl. Come on! That's it, yes. Come on, that's very good. Come on, come on, come on! You ruined everything. All you care about is money. What about my career? You don't care about it because you get nothing from it. Gigi, please, listen to me. No. You're jealous, that's what you are. I was going to have an important role. You sabotaged everything on purpose. Gigi. Gigi! What's wrong, Gigi? Mom put an end to my relationship with Mr. Marcadet. Don't worry, Mr. Marcadet is a very good friend of mine, you know. Thank you, Mr. Casoar. Listen to me, lovebirds. I have a proposition for you. And I won't say anything to your mother. You could keep all the money for yourself. You could spend some good time with a nice wad of cash in your pocket. So? 2000 for each of you. What do you say? Is that okay with you? So, kids, is that okay with you? You're my sugar daddy, Mr. Casoar. Gentlemen... The "Peep Show of Pigalle" is pleased to offer his guests a special performance. A one-of-a-kind show. She can't get enough of it. Come on! Come on! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! I love you. I'm so wasted. So what do we do now? You're home late, Gigi. But, Mom... I made 2500 bucks today. Look at this. Casoar organised a party. We had a lot of fun. That no excuse for being late and make so much noise. Come on! Tell your friend to leave. You have an appointment around noon. Mom, he stays here. He will even sleep here. After all, I'm the one who's making money. In that case, I'm going to bed. Don't make noise. I'll wake you up in six hours. I mean, I'll wake you both up. Goodnight, Mom. What is it? Oh, look at her! - Suck them, Gigi. - No, no. I'll give you 1000 francs for each one you suck. No, no. You will make 3000 Francs. So go for it. Come on. There. Oh, yeah. That's incredible. Oh my, this chick is hungry for cocks. Take care of him now. Life is hard. It's party time! It's been a long time since I've done that. That's nice. You're gonna love it. Ah, that feels so good! It's not over. Everyone gets a turn, come on! What a little whore! Come on, shoot your load! That's nice. That's superb. Now that's some sperm. Ah, sweet chick. Come on. Come on! Stop! Stop it! Come on, that's enough! Now calm down. What about me? Give him the booze. Shit! I'm satisfied, Gigi. Here. Here you are. With a bonus. But just for you. Not for your mother. Do you understand me? Thank you. Gigi, let me give you some advice. Be careful. Your mother exploits your generous nature, Gigi. Maybe. I am absolutely convinced of it. Ah, here we are. Oh, look, it's Gigi. - Come here, Gigi. - Come over here. Look how beautiful she is. We keep her? Oh yes, we keep her. Look at her. What do you think? We keep her. Come here. How's work going? Fine. Don't look so glum. You're so beautiful. By the way, we put your mother in the room next door. You'll see, she can't move anymore. I have 3000 bucks, Mom. Yeah, sure. Rest well, Mom. That feels good. How much did you make today? A lot of money. I hope you will keep it for yourself this time. - Okay? - Okay. You're beautiful, Gigi. I want you. Me too, Patrick. I'm going to make love to you, honey. Make love to me gently, softly. Patrick! Take it, Gigi. Come on! You're making me so hard. Keep stroking it. Come on, you're driving me crazy. Hey you! You're kidding me, right? Come on, get out of here. Come on, go back to work! On the street, quick! - What were you doing here? - Stop. You'd better move your ass and be a good whore if you don't want to get hurt. Come on! Come on! You'd better make a lot of money!
