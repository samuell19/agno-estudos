Hey do you remember that attorney's name? The one we met last time. Hello, hello. Good dope huh? I guess so. What did you say? We met some attorney over there. Remember his wife worked for some judge? I don't know. Well I saw him in the street the other day. His wife's name was Jane or Janet or... Yeah I don't want to walk in there and do one of my hey man routines. Everybody will be stunned when we get there anyway. Speaking of which I laid out a few lines in the bedroom. Great that's just what I need. Cut. Okay that was good everybody. Dom what about that turn? Got it she looked great. Good. Well I still don't know what to do when he comes in? No no you're fine, you're stoned you're confused. Besides everything's happening too fast for you to even be scared. Alright what's next? I think we're through. Barney, Rita you're finished. Oh great. Tomorrow we start early. Oh man. - I mean it. - I need that light. - That's right. - I gotta get some sleep. 6am, early. Do you want the jogging suit or the shorts? Probably the jogging suit. Yeah so you're ass doesn't hang out. See you two tomorrow. Hey, listen. So is that a wrap? That's a wrap. Hey you know what? That went pretty well. It's a long schedule. They're not bad together. On camera. They married or what? Now. I could drive a truck through your god damn lines. Okay you two, I'll see you later. Get some continuity distracting, I just saw you go crazy. Yeah, well why don't you stop smoking real joints in the god damn place. I don't know it's in the bathroom. Did Lacey want these any place in particular? Oh yeah over on the kitchen counter. He's got somebody who picks it up and takes it to the bus station. This is sync take three. Okay standby. I got speed. Speed. Slate it Celeste. Action. Keith comes up in about a week. Anyway we don't have much of a chance. They have the judge in their hip pocket. Yeah he's Sloan's golfing buddy. Something's wrong Mona? Something's wrong Mona? Hey the steelers are playing the browns on Sunday. We aught to get tickets if we can. Something's wrong Mona. Thoughts tending to ambition, these do plot unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails may rend a passage in the flinty ribs of this hard world my ragged prison walls. And for they cannot die in their own pride. Thus play I in one person many people and none of them contented. Sometimes am I king, then treasons make me wish myself a beggar. But whate'er I be, nor I nor any man that but man is with nothing is content, till he be eased with being nothing. Play that one back for Lacey bickel. How's the tuxedo? Out of date. I left my top hot in the car. Yeah right. How you doing? How am I doing right. How you doing? Fine. We played a good day today. Not bad. Excuse me Maria. Maria that's her name huh? Hey, you doing? Good. Good. Maria, Maria a double bourbon for the lady and a double... Scotch please. Alright wait double scotch for the lady. And double bourbon for me, easy on the ice. Why aren't you acting in this film instead of doing the lights? Rita's better for the role. I like doing the lights alright. I never worked with a woman gaffer before. Beats working at a massage parlor. Oh yeah yeah, sure does. Did you do that? No. It beats, I mean it beats it. I mean look at that guy over there right. Gene Kelly should of had one of those things right? J I'm singing in the bar just uh-oh, uh-oh, you and your big mouth. My father, knows. Hey where's your cape drac? - We were just talking about. - You got a light? I had one. How you doing? My card. Have umbrella will travel right. Would you keep that away from me? That's, that's. Anyway. Great, that's terrific. Okay great, look guy. Hey bud hang on. J everybody got the groove no look pal I mean what the fuck right? J can you feel it j don't you feel it j don't you feel it Celeste, come on. J I feel the groove j I feel the groove j I feel the groove Hey, thinks for defending my honor. What? I said thanks. Alright looks real enough. Now if we put this under her skirt are we really gonna make the audience believe that is her leg? Sure on the cut after she's knocked down yeah. Alright but what about the blood? What about it? Well is there enough? Why? That's the way it would read with a razor cut down there. Listen how important is reality when we're trying to... Are we making a cartoon? It would be nice just to see one little spurt at the moment of slashing. Nobody is gonna believe a spurt of blood. They'll believe anything we show them. But blood doesn't spurt when you cut somebody there. It's spurts when you cut by an artery. Hey Celeste, I don't need an anatomy lesson. Besides nobody has ever gone broke underestimating the intelligence of an audience. Well for sure but they'll be plenty of blood because he's gonna be slashing at her repeatedly right? I know that but I want the first one to grab them. You're so subtle. You want the blood to spurt up into the camera lens? Yeah, why not? Alright we start here right? He slashes at her repeatedly huh? She drags herself up the stairs. Blood flows, it's starts slow at first but then it builds up to a frenzied pitch. Look at that plenty of blood huh? Maybe a little dramatic buildup. You know all about that right? God knows the script could use some. What a bitch. She's pretty good with that razor huh? You aught to put her in the movie. Yeah. I'll see you at four. Hey. I'm going to town for a burger, you want one? Hey Lacey, how's the movie going? Nicky, alright. The chase. He cannot he escape. He has nowhere to go. Here it is buddy. I have him in my sites. Gin.

You're really frightened but you turn and are drawn to that gun in the closet. Alright okay now, once you've picked up the gun you turn and aim towards whatever's coming up the stairs at you.

You know Lacey I been on a lot of shoots but this is the craziest location. Sleeping on the sets with people. My gaffer's an actress, it's been interesting. Hey we're a peoples film company man. You ain't seen nothing yet buddy. The movie will do alright, possession's the thing right now. Characters are good, a little shallow but. Oh really? About the only thing you don't have is a good chase to the climax. Buh, buh, buh. Well thanks that's a nice vote of confidence. But I think it's gonna be your special effects that's gonna bring them in. That's bullshit, unless something's really happening people don't care how they die. No you're wrong man, that's all they remember. Yeah remember when they chopped that guys head off and the omen? Yeah but it was the way it happened, the situation. Why it was the guys head falling off? Or when they blew that guy up in the fury. Oh no the greatest was night of the living dead with those cats eating one another. Oh man I was 14 when I saw that film, it scared me for a year. Sure but the films that work for me have to have something more going for them. Yeah I know what you mean. But I'm not sure it matters to most people. Hey dom you want to do a line of cocaine? Cocaine? Yeah haven't you ever seen any before? Yeah I've seen it I just never did any. What do you do? Hold the bill up to your nose and snort, hard. Hard? I blew it all around. Okay now stick your thumb up in your nose to block the air off. Makes your nose cold. Now do that line with the other nostril. I won't od or anything will 1? Come on man, it won't hurt you. Okay? Okay now, take your fingertips and dip them in the glass. Take some water on them and snort up your nostril. Seriously. It's funny to have your nose cold. Don't make me laugh man. Hey man you're okay. Thanks lobo. You must be okay to get Celeste in the sack. That chick's crazy. She's very talented. Oh yeah tell us about it Janet. I think my head just lit up. No really can she can sing, I mean really sing. And she's the best god damn gaffer I ever worked with. Yep she can act too. She's gonna be very good in this film. She's not in this film. Right, must be better coke than I thought. So tell me some more about this theory of yours. Yeah come on, come on. It's not a theory, I mean it's just an opinion. Well in that case I have a film I want you to see. That film oh, man the lifeboats, women and children first. I wouldn't let any son of mine see a film like this. So in the words of ichabod crane I'll just take my head and go. This film was sent to me by this movie will blow your mind. What's it about? You'll find out. Can we do some more lines before we see it? Hey I don't want to talk all night, I might bore lobo. Oh come on, we have nowhere to go. Sit around for awhile, you can do your Doris day impersonations. Thanks. This film was made for a rather specific audience. Yeah I'll say. Will I like it? Lobo you'll love it. Yeah you got it. Another nose beam. Okay let's see a movie. Dom would you get those lights please? Alright, hey I've seen this one before. Yeah they all look the same lobo. No no no, this isn't what I thought it was. This is too much. Hey is this for real man? Jesus Christ. I heard of them films. Is it real man? Where the hell did you get that thing? Friend of mine sent it to me. But you can never find out who made it. I don't know what to say about a film like that. Was that girl killed? It's trash, killing somebody on film? It's sick, for what? Well now wait a minute. You make your living creating and photographing special effects. Couldn't those of been special effects? Maybe it's not real. No, no that was real. It look real to me, play it again. No, not for me thanks. Tell me dom do you think people would pay to see something like that? Sure, sure people pay to see anything. You did, your friend did. Yeah but I'm a filmmaker, what about the general public? What's the difference, you paid. Okay now what if I told you that I made that film? Oh Lacey don't bust my nuts. I'm serious. - You made that film? - As a student you're even sicker than I thought. I made that film as a student and that girl was never hurt, she was never touched. I don't believe you, that girl was killed. Are you're really sure? Did you really do that movie? You should of hired that guy to do the special effects on this film if he could do that. Well he died in a motorcycle accident last year. Oh come on man quit fucking around. Is it for real or what? Shit lace let's see it again. Looking for inspiration? How are we? This is in Russian. But I'll show it to you some time. You want a drink? Sure. So what are you doing down here all alone watching home movies? I'm looking for inspiration. How about you? Well I think this whole experience has been really fantastic, very exiting. But I'm really glad it's almost finished. There's just something a little weird you know in-grown about this whole situation. Just what you need right, a neurotic actress. It's just I get so damned freaked looking in that mirror. I'm actually a little tired and slightly frazzled. And Barney certainly doesn't help. You should be filming this right. Sometimes I think he's really gonna come at me with that razor. Excuse for a minute. Hey, you don't have to stay up and babysit. No that's okay I'll be right back. Get the camera my husband is driving me slightly crazy. I think this movie's really coming true. This is fantastic, like I said right a great experience. I think my mascara's all over my face. Would you like to have sex? That would feel really good but, Do you mean with you, or just in general? Well I'm looking for inspiration. And I'm looking for a good night's sleep. I mean thanks for the offer. But then what am I thanking you for? You know what I mean? I really need to get a good night's sleep. You don't care right? I mean what kind of inspiration would I be? See you tomorrow? J you know you are a scumbag j I'm just through with you j that's why they say your such a bag j you got a long ways j hair falling out of your head j yeah your thumbs are bleeding freely j got the pair little blues baby jj but not for me ha J yeah a woman's as good as another j when it comes to loving a man j one thing I know is so baby j you gotta do it the best you can Jesus Barney. J every time I see you how do you shut that thing off anyway? J got the pair little blues baby jj but not I couldn't find a razor anywhere. But I see you found her. She's a very beautiful girl. Yeah well... She really could dance too. Should have sent her up to pay me a visit. Yeah maybe. Maybe next time huh? Yeah sorry you missed her the last time. We need the razor. Oh yeah sure, it's right here. I didn't think to look through your drawers. It's alright handsome, you can look through my drawers anytime. You coming? If you insist. Say listen if you're into that sort of... No no, not for me thanks. Are you sure next time we get one of those up here? Well we'll see you know. Listen you wouldn't believe where I found her, Pittsburgh. My buddy usually picks them. Perfect chance to show his chest and arms and legs. Sure beats a hooker I'll tell you. Now he's slashing at you as he follows you up these stairs but you stumble and fall, that means you're gonna have to crawl at the top. Here it is boss. Okay now he's laughing at you like a lunatic, he's cursing at you but somehow you manage to get up to that closet. Well you wanted the shot from behind. Well yeah you could do that. Hand held on the stairs is gonna be tricky. I know that. Okay now you've got the flashlight, use it. It's gonna enable you to get up to the top. And once you get there you turn and give him a little push. He stumbles but you also drop the flashlight. So you come to the closet, slide the door open, reach inside for the gun which is kept there in case of emergency. Awe that's a nice neat little package lace. Yeah I learned it in film school. She could drop the flashlight we could finesse it to get the shaft of lights on the stairs. Yeah not bad I like that. Now am I screaming anything intelligible? Only 'til I cut your throat and slice your mouth off. Yeah you'd be saying something like Arthur why, you're killing me, you bastard. Shouldn't be hard. Okay dom let's take it from downstairs so we can see if this handheld thing will work. Right. Bastard huh Lacey? It's Barney. Quiet Barney. Oh well you can call me Barney fife, or you can call me Barney, or you can call me barnabo, or you can call me barnaster, or you can call me barnacle, or you can call me burney, or you can call me barnardo, but you don't have to call me bastard! Barney get out of here with that thing. Hey take that over to lover boy. Hey let's go away together. After the shoot we'll go up to Maine for a few days. You and me? You're name please? Why? What?

I'm sorry you just took me by surprise that's all. Hey me too. Me too I didn't expect to meet the greatest... Surprise! Anyone ever hear of nose jobs? Do them quick and cheap. Hey bitch. That was pretty gross Barney. Be careful man. This is one sweet hog here. How come you nose is always so far up in the air bitch? Maybe we can fix it a little for you huh? Just get out of here asshole. We know different don't we? Well if there's ever anything I can do for our nose handsome don't hesitate to give me a call. Happy trails. Is he a faggot or what? I don't know. I mean he's changing all the times it's crazy. I thought he was gonna slit your throat. I wouldn't be at all surprised. Hey Celeste, you think I need a nose job? Dom, dom wake up. We gotta change something. Get dressed and come outside and meet me. What time is it? Don't wake Celeste. Just get dressed and come outside. Fuck me. Hey you know what it's mighty early to be up so.

I've decided that I want to run the credits over a series of shots of this wild country right. We got a possession thing here, some demon all around us, maybe some smoldering hatred that's been wickedly fanned. This demon is everywhere even in this wild and beautiful country. Pretty scary if you think about it that way huh? Sounds great, we have to do it now right? Yeah because I want the light to be just right. Now I been up there in the morning, I know what it's like.
