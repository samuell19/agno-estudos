Breaking news from California, at the Metropolitan Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles. A now familiar scene, an officer accused of the shooting of an unarmed African-American male in the Southwest Division last August has been found not guilty. The officer involved fatally shot a 19-year-old victim... Hey, Pops. ...after a chase over a suspected drug deal. The officer claimed he thought the victim was reaching for a gun in his car... Can I get a coffee? - It's not working, man. - ...which turned out to be his wallet. What? Prosecutors accused the officers of entering into a conspiracy... Then let me get a medium Coke. ...with other officers to plant misleading evidence at the scene, including a weapon. All across the city and the nation, including Swinton, spontaneous protests have erupted to decry the verdict, as well as to protest police violence. At the courthouse, activists gathered outside and marched through downtown. Various peaceful protests escalated, as objects were thrown at City Hall, as well as several police vehicles. At least 14 people were arrested. Three officers have been treated for wounds, including one... You're not welcome here today, Kevin. Not today, man. Was she amazing? Oh, that's my baby. That's my princess. Was it the blue dress? I know. I know. I know. I wish I could be there, too. There's a lot going on, all right? You know. I'm doing this for us. It'll all be over soon enough. I won't miss anything else. Okay, I love you, too, baby. Hey, baby. I gotta go. All right? Bye. Dispatch, this is 18-Lincoln-4. Over. 18-Lincoln-4, go ahead. Central, show me with a car pull-over at East 11th and South Dakota. I have a green Chevy van with left tail light out. - No tags. - 10-4, 18-Lincoln-4. Ma'am, can you roll your window down, please? Ma'am, roll your window down now. Ma'am, place your hands on the steering wheel. Right now! Step out of the van! Exit the vehicle! Get out of your vehicle now! Turn around! Turn around! Get your hands on the vehicle. Put your hands in the air now. Put your hands on the vehicle now! Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Turn around now! Don't make me hurt you, please. Are you on... Get on the ground. What is wrong... Some of this may sound redundant. I appreciate your patience as we hammer through these questions again, Renee. Please bear with me as the standard review questions are cursory. I just wanna dig in one more time to what we've been talking about over the week. Okay? Have you had any trouble sleeping? No. Any trouble relating to people? No. Have you had violent impulses? As we talked about, it was a complicated situation. Renee, you struck a civilian. People can say whatever they want about what happened. The administration and the public saw your body cam footage, Renee. They saw how you handled that. Look, I gotta be on point. I have to walk up to strangers. Some of them are hostile. Can you handle that stress? Have you moved on from your son's death? I need to work. I really need to work. Okay. I'm going to recommend you return to active duty on nights again, okay? Yes. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. You can start the next shift. Watch commander will pair you. We had an alley dump last night. Female, Latina, 20s. No ID, no suspects at this time. So be on the lookout. Check with your CIs. See if you can get anything. Also, with the acquittal of our brother officers yesterday, Mr. and Mrs. Public are gonna be all out of sorts, so be gracious. Courteous. Don't start shit. - Good to see you. - Stay poised. Also, let's welcome back Officer Lomito. She is officially back in the badge. And according to my notes, she's buying everybody a beer after watch. Okay, that's it. Let's go do work. Stay safe. Sarge, you put me with a rookie. Really? I get it. Help me out. Hey, come here. Welcome back, lady. Thanks, Sarge. Don't slap anyone today. All right. Here you go. Here you go. It might be crazy out there tonight. Yes. I didn't know that you scuba dived. I don't, but I will. Just been itching to get back on the job. Yeah. - How's everything? Okay. - It's good. What up? What up? - Danny Holledge? - Yeah. Officer Lomito? Yeah. We're partnering together. Danny, this is Penda, Ganning, Birke and Roberts. Oh, yeah. We know this fuck-face. Ganning was his first CO. Tried his best to break him. Holledge, you got yourself a good babysitter. - You got yourself squared? - Yep. All right, y'all be safe. - You be safe, Renee. - Thanks, guys. Hey, Danny. Public's got no love for us right now. Your head down, your eyes open. Stay close to Renee. All right. Got it. Head down, eyes open. But not too close. - Can I go? - Yeah. If you're looking to make a little extra cash, Danny, I could use somebody to mow my lawn on Sunday. Fuck you. Fuck you, guys. You're welcome. - Pink is your color. - Can't be too careful. I mean, she punched somebody in the face. Watch that right hook. You know, those guys back there, they're just, you know, fucking around. They do really respect me. They don't actually... You know, I'm not a baby, I've been doing this for a good minute. Hmm... Should we put on some music, or are we just gonna sit here in total silence? - Hey, looks like a kid. - Yeah. What's up, little guy? Hey. Hi there. It's okay, sweetie. What you doing out here? Just wanna make sure you're okay. Calm down. It's okay. Hey. Take it easy. We're good, we're good. Hey. Get away from him. Come on, come inside. Sorry, ma'am. Just trying to make sure he's okay. Mind your own damn business. Come on, baby. You got yourself a little boy in the middle of the... Hey, back up, back up. - Back up, back up. Back up now. - What's happening here? Everything's all right. Everything's all right. Calm down. Just trying to make sure the kid's all right. He was in the street. Go back to your homes, okay? - Hey. - Just relax. Everything's good. Come on. - The police, man - Useless, man. Go back to your homes. Everything is okay. Have a good night. That was good, how you handled that, though. Thanks. - Dispatch to 18-Adam-7, come in. Over. - Go for 18-Adam-7. 18-Adam-7, code two, East 11th and South Dakota, 18-Lincoln-4. Failure to respond. We're code six. That's Ganning. Yeah. Dispatch, 18-Adam-7 en route to location. 18-Adam-7, proceed with caution. 18-Adam-7, responding. ETA, three minutes. He's probably just fucking around. No, it's not like him. What the hell happened to the street lights? Dispatch, this is 18-Adam-7. Spotted 18-Lincoln-4 on East 11th and South Dakota. The cruiser is down. 10-4, 18-Adam-7. Rolling backup. 18-Adam-9... Shit. Danny. Oh, shit. Fucking teeth? Not working. Fucking thing is shot. Grab the big light, check the north side. Send me more units. Still trying to locate 18-Lincoln-4. Over. Copy, 18-Adam-7. Hey. Hey. Hey. - Holledge. - Hands on the steering wheel. Put your hands on the steering wheel. Get out of the vehicle now. Ma'am, get out of your vehicle now. Green van, no plates. Oh, my God. Kevin. Danny. You got something? There's gotta be a way in here. What the hell? Shit. So what do we got? Green Chevy van. No plates. Ganning pulled the vehicle over. Pulls his weapon on a female, black, 30s. Whoa, whoa, the driver? I'm not sure. The footage cut out. The footage doesn't exist, Renee. IT said that the card got fried when Ganning's car got hit. I saw that footage, sir. So who hit his car? The green van? Ganning's body cam got fried, too. It's blank. Kesper, so these two were the primary unit that took the call? We saw a black female, 30s. So one woman did all this? Is that why you screwed around with the dash cam? You know protocol. It's evidence, Officer. By touching it, you're interfering with the crime scene. Sarge... Okay, okay. I'll meet you back there. If you wanna help Ganning, write up what you saw while it's still fresh in your mind. This is fucking bullshit. Come on, man. Let's go. Let's get a drink. Thank you, hon. Bourbon, rocks. Thanks, man. What you drinking? Club soda. Shit. Ganning was my first partner. I can't fucking believe that he's dead. It's crazy. I mean, who the fuck would do something like that to him? It's bullshit. And it doesn't make any sense. No, it doesn't make any sense. Doesn't give you any faith in humanity. And that fucking detective telling us that we can go home? Yeah, I know. How could I tell her what I saw? The whole department's just waiting for me to fuck up again. Why? 'Cause I hit a guy. Yeah, I saw that video, too. Shit. - Everybody's seen that video. - Yeah. That guy, he just wouldn't shut up. He just kept talking and talking. Just being disrespectful, you know? What was he saying? He said some shit like, "You black bitch." And I blacked out. Lost it. Body cam footage was all they needed to take me off the street for eight months. I mean, listen, I'm not unstable. I was going through a lot. I lost my son. Shit. He drowned in our neighbor's pool. I'm sorry about that. - Hey, my queen. - Hey. You're home early. What happened? What? Ganning. He was killed. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. - Are you okay? - No. I feel almost out of touch with reality. I can't even explain what I saw. Something terrible happened, and I have to find out why. Wait. It's your first day back. Can't they put someone else on it? This man was like my brother. You're too close to Ganning, or Christopher. It's all just too much. I can't have another person close to me die, without trying to do something. I felt so helpless with Christopher. I still feel helpless. - I've got to do something. - Hey. Don't worry. You're not alone. Mom! Mom! Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! Place your hands on the wheel. Step out of the van! Will you roll your window down? Ma'am, get out of the vehicle now! Dispatch, this is 18-Adam-7. Need a DMV check on a Taneesha Branz. Age, 34. Copy that. That woman on Ganning's dash cam, I might know who she is. This was on her scrubs. - What is it? - It's Swinton Hospital. I remember it when I had my son there. Checked the staff website. She hasn't worked there in six months. 18-Adam-7, Taneesha Branz, 1733 North Dorgenois. No wants. No warrants. Copy that. Lomito. No, leave it off for now. It's my business. For Taneesha Branz. This was sent like a month ago. Taneesha Branz? There's gotta be another way in. Let's try the side. You see anything? Just a bunch of clothes. Lomito? It's open. Come on. Oh, shit. There's nothing. Look for any evidence linking her to Ganning's murder. Okay. This must be her son. What the hell? You hear that? We need to get out of here, Renee. Someone's in here. Fuck! All right, Lomito, I'm out of here. Fuck this. Holledge, is that you running around upstairs? I'm outside. There's nobody in there. I don't see anybody in there. Police officer. Who's there? See anyone? No, I didn't see anybody. I just had like 1000 fucking cockroaches fly at me. I'm feeling like... - What? - Crazy. I don't know how I feel about this. You know, you checking out your own leads. I don't know really if I can do this. It's like... I think it's kind of freaking me out. You gotta trust me. Okay? Okay, I trust you. Okay? Let's go. Fucking roaches, man. I'd rather get shot at. Yeah, I want my fucking money. I want my fucking money. I'm telling you, I want my money. You stupid ass. How you gonna steal a stick-shift when you can't drive? You wanna ride people. You can't do that, dude. Thinking for everybody. I'm not playing with him. Oh, man. He stupid, bro. And he's running around here, with jewelry all on his neck. Crazy, bro. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Mr. Never-have. - I got you. What's up, brother? You got a charger? My phone dead. Don't have any. You didn't even ask me what kind of phone I got. Hey, buddy. Come on, man. It's a neighborhood store. Come on. I don't have a charger, sir. - USB. - I don't have any. How you doing? Go look in the back, man. No. Hey, put that back. - Man, what you gonna do? - Put the beer back. Hey. Hey, woman. Buddy, come on, man. Come on. Why you hiding? - Don't do this. - Charger. - I don't have a charger. - Look in the back. You ain't gonna tell me? You scared of me? Huh? - Yo. Leave her alone. - Shut the fuck up. - Leave her alone! - I said, shut the fuck up! Get the fuck out, man. Get the fuck out of my store. - Shut up. - We're not going nowhere, bro. - You are. Let's see. - We're not going no-motherfucking-where. I'm gonna report your motherfucking ass. Hey. I'm right here. Say it. Say you're scared. Come on now. What does having... Hey. Green van. No plates. Reported at Ganning's pull-over, right? Goddamn right. Hey, Dispatch, this is 18-Indie-5 checking 1154. Green van, no plates, in the 1300 block of Ripley. Possible vehicle involved in Ganning's homicide. Requesting backup. Over. 10-4, 18-Indie-5. Backup responding. Proceed with extreme caution. 18-Adam-7, code two. 1300 block of Ripley. 18-Adam-5, sighting of a green van. No plates. Requesting backup. Hey. Who owns the van? They're stealing things, man. We're not stealing nothing. This man lying, bro. He's stealing. - You driving the van out front? - No, sir. We ain't drive no van. Down on your knees. Hands above your head. Fuck this. Drop the phone and get down on your knees. Dude, I just told you, we're not driving that shit. Do you have any weapons on you? This is fucked up. Keep filming, bro. I don't got nothing on me. - I don't got shit on me, sir. - Shut up! Let us out! Hey, Birke! Birke! Can you hear me? Let me and my boy out of here. - Birke, say something. - What the fuck, bro? Fuck that, man. I ain't going back. Birke! Birke! Let us out. Let her go, or I'll light your ass up! Think I'm playing? Birke, talk to me. Birke. Dispatch, this is 18-Adam-7 arriving for backup, 1300 block of Ripley. Did 18-Indie-5 report back? Over. 18-Indie-5 went code six a few minutes ago. Roger that. Scanning the area. Over. - Clear. - Clear. Officer down. Officer down. Shit. She's dead. Dispatch, it's 18-Adam-7. We got an officer down. Send an EMT now. 18-Adam-7, dispatching ambulance... Shit. Shit. Second officer down. Dispatch, this is 18-Adam-7. Correction. We've got two officers down, okay? Send an ambulance immediately! Copy, 18-Adam-7. Clear. There you are. ...on me, sir. Fuck! So, apparently, the security cameras in this place are completely cosmetic, because there's nothing on the cards. They're blank. I'd put out an APB on a black woman, mid 30s. Someone you saw on the scene? I'm thinking it's the same woman from Ganning's dash cam. Did you see a woman here? Um... No. Okay, listen. This is what we've got so far. We ran the VIN number on the van. It's the property of the pastor of a church on Gaskell. We questioned him after Ganning's murder, and he said that his van completely disappeared. We figure that the perps that were in there got it, Ganning tried to bust them, and they killed him. It appears that Roberts and Birke found these guys. Did they say how they were killed? Uh, no. We're still working on it. We'll take it from here. Renee. They're gonna try to pin Ganning's murder on these two. That's good, right? Yeah, but they weren't the ones driving the van when he pulled it over. Taneesha Branz was. What are you talking about? Come on. What are you doing? Did you take that? Is that evidence? What are they gonna say when you... What the fuck are they gonna say when they find that you're stealing evidence? - You're the only one that knows. - No, I'm not doing this. - Relax. - No, Renee. All right? You're on your own trip. - Fuck you. - No, fuck you. I think you're a mother who lost her kid, and you've become obsessed with some woman who lost hers. And now you're saying a bunch of crazy shit. All this stuff with this lady. They found their guys. You need to fucking let it go. What the fuck do you mean, "let it go"? Okay? Just leave it alone. Oh, hey, Renee. How are you doing? I've been better. I hear that. What can I do for you? You processed a couple of bodies that came in. Couple of special ones. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. Are you wanting to see them? I can't do it. It's not protocol. I'll get in trouble. You can give me those brown eyes all you want, but I'm telling you, I just can't do it. - Weren't you the one that found them? - Yeah. If I get in trouble, I'm coming after you. Quite a mess. Well, here he is. You can see how he's mangled. You can see right around there, just teeth coming through a cheek there, I think. I don't know. But his associate over here, that's a different story altogether. Get a load of this shit. I get scalps coming in in all kinds of conditions, but I've never had anything come in looking like this. Did they put in what the official cause was? There's no official cause. They're gonna fly a medical examiner in from Chicago to look at these two guys, because everybody's pretty fucked up about what happened. Mind if I get a moment alone? Uh... Renee, this is my job, and I love it for what it is. Look, I understand. I'm gonna give you five minutes. But please don't fuck anything up. Don't take anything. And cut the lights off when you leave. Cool. Hurry up. You think it's a game? You think I won't kill her, huh? Let us out. Let me and my boy out of here. You think it's a game? You think I won't kill her, huh? Let us out. Let me and my boy out of here. Let me and my boy out of here. You think it's a game? You think I won't kill her, huh? Let us out. You think I won't kill her, huh? Let us out. Babe? You coming up to bed? Yeah. I'll be up in a minute. All right. What the... No, you're the coolest mom ever. I just really want you to be safe, you know? You're always out there, and, you know, you have a gun, and people might hurt you. I don't want them to hurt you. Mom, I just wanna protect you, no matter what. I just wanna protect you, but I can't. Nor can Dad. No one can. No one can. In this job, what matters is what we do and how we do it. We're never gonna get the respect we deserve, because nobody outside this room knows how hard this job is. Respect doesn't come from out there. It comes from in here. This week, we lost two more of our own. Officer Gabe Roberts and Maria Birke. I know some of you may despair, but let me remind you that when we're attacked, we stand tall. We stand together. And we are strong. Just a reminder that this weekend we have the wake for Gabe and Maria, so I know I'll see you all there. Okay, that's it. Let's go. Be safe. I'm sorry. I know you've been going through a lot. I got a lot of respect for you. Mm-hmm. I'm glad you're back. These times, we need all of us together. You know, we're like a family. Whenever you need an ear, I'm here. Okay? - Excuse me. - Sure. Hey, Penda. Hey, Renee. - It's sad, huh? - Yeah. Everything all right? Remember the killing of a kid named DeMarco Branz? Taneesha Branz was his mother's name. That was a kid in an empty lot. Looked like a drive-by gang thing. We found him bled out. - Pretty obvious what happened. - Right. Thank you. - Danny. - Renee. Renee. You have the best name, Renee. Did you know that your name, Renee, is Kermit the Frog in Spanish? So, they don't even have a Kermit. They just have a Renee the Frog. Ganning has a good name, too. Ganning, Roberts, Birke. Danny. - Hey, hey, hey. - I wasn't ready for this. I wasn't ready for any of this shit. I thought that I was ready, but I wasn't. There's a lot going on right now. Just... What's going on with you? What happened to the club soda? - No more alcohol. - Okay. Okay? Let me and my boy out of here. You think it's a game? You think I won't kill her, huh? Let us out. Let me and my boy out of here. You think it's a game? You think I won't kill her, huh? Let us out. Let me and my boy out of here. You think it's a game? You think I won't kill her, huh? Let us out. You okay, baby? Look, I'm sorry, Gary. I don't wanna stress you out with everything that's happening to me. Let's just take care of us right now. Go someplace peaceful, a vacation or something. You know? Share the weight with me, please. I feel like there's a different reality that only I can see. There's only one reality. We share it. For all we know it, could be stress. It's not stress. Yeah, after what we went through, nobody expects us to be rational through this. And I wanna help. You can't help. I gotta figure this out on my own. People are talking about you. They think you're losing it. And I'm scared for you. Everybody keeps saying, you know, "She's chasing her own leads. She's playing detective." Look, all these things that keep happening, they mean something. I'm just trying to do the right thing. So am I. All right? Lomito, I'm just trying to get through training, and keep my head down, and not fuck anything up. And I'm trying to help you save your job because I care about you. - Okay? - Okay. Danny. Yeah. Look, I need you. In or out? Pierce, I need info. I need an address from a detective's report that was filed from Ganning's case. A church Hayes mentioned. Can you help me out? The lou asked me to do a follow-up. Just a couple of questions. Okay. Ask me 'cause I know everything. Thomas Cozzalio Jackson. Over on East Adams. Officer, how can I help you? You told our detectives that a green van disappeared off your property. It wasn't stolen, was it? You lent it to Taneesha Branz. If you impede an investigation, that's obstruction of justice. Come to the back, and we can speak properly. We've got about 20 kids in the program. This is the activity room. And this is the room where Taneesha used to take her son, DeMarco. DeMarco was one of the smartest kids we'd ever worked with. Intense. Devoted to his mom, who was maybe a little too protective of him. They were close. Look at this. DeMarco couldn't hear. But he was a resourceful child who found ways to communicate. Fourteen years old, but there wasn't a day he wasn't out in this city somewhere, doing volunteer work or community service. That's the kind of boy that he was. Then he gets killed by senseless violence. What do you think that kind of loss does to a mother? Where's Taneesha? She needs to get off the street before somebody else dies. And you'll help her? I'll do what I can. Taneesha? This is Kesper. Leave a message. Sarge, I need your help. This is Renee. Hit me back. Hey, Renee. Hi. Holledge. Listen to me. I need to see you right now. - Why? - Not over the phone. I tracked down Taneesha. Penda may be involved in some bad shit. Holledge. Okay. Okay. Give me an hour. All right. Thanks, Danny. Danny! Danny. Oh, no, no, no. Fuck. It's the police! It's the police! Suspect spotted. Let's go. It's the police! Yeah, that's him. He fits the description. Hey, stop! Stop where you are! Right now! - Stop! - Hey! Hey, turn around! Suspect is resisting. - Get on your knees now! - On your knees! On your knees! - Fuck! - Wait. Everybody, wait. Just stop. He's down. - Penda, what's the move? - Hold it, hold it. - What's the play? - All right, Roberts, get in there. - What? - Get in there. Move. - Clear. Clear. - I got you, I got you. - Cover. - Ganning, stay back. Danny, follow me. Come on, Danny. Danny, you were there. - We saw him. We told him to stop. - Yeah. Fuck. He's a kid. Hey, we told him to stop. He didn't even turn around. What's in there? What the fuck? Shit. He's deaf. - What? - The kid's deaf. That's why he didn't respond to us. He can't fucking hear. Oh, fuck me. Who saw this? Hey, did anyone see this? Ganning, come here. Okay. All right, you with me? Take a look at him. Oh, shit, his teeth. - Oh, shit. - Wait up, here you go. Hey, we really need to get him a bus. We need to get him a bus. He's not gonna make it. Danny? Lookit, man. - Yeah? - The optics on this look real bad. - Yeah. - You understand me? - Uh-huh. - It gets out we shot a kid, and the public, and the administration, and everybody's gonna ream our ass, okay? So, I'd appreciate it... We'd appreciate it if you cooperate and let's just keep this between us. The kid's bleeding out. Look at me. Can I trust you? Danny? - You want a future, right? - Yeah. - Can I trust you? - Yeah. - Yeah, you can trust me. - Good. We don't want any more gunfire. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Easy. Damn, Danny. Mom, you have such a dangerous job. You could have picked so many other ones, but you picked to be a police. Why can't you be a doctor, or a fireman or something? Daddy can't even help you. I wish I could help, though. No one can. This is Kesper. Leave a message. Sarge, Danny Holledge is dead. He was holding evidence. I'm headed to the old plant on 53rd and 3rd. I need to show you what I have. Taneesha? Taneesha, I know what happened to your son. - Sarge, come upstairs. - Renee. - Hey. - Hey. What's the evidence that you have? Body cam footage of the night of the murder. Kind of shit that starts riots. It's really... We need to stay unified about what happened. Let's talk inside. Sarge, you saw that footage, too? I don't need to see it. I just need to get rid of it. Letting the public see the record would do nothing but weaken our department. Holledge kept a copy of that video? Where the hell is it? Danny's dead. He died because of you. You know, I always thought you were a cop first. I am a cop first, bitch. Give me that video, Renee. Or the next one goes in your head instead of your vest. What is it? You killed my son. Who the fuck are you? - DeMarco. - What? You remember him? 'Cause he remembers you. Enough of this shit. What the fuck is that? Did you see that? - Behind you. - What? Kesper. Kesper! - Help me. - What the fuck? Come on. Please, help. You need to leave. It's DeMarco. Can't control him. You need to leave. No. You need to leave. No, no, no. Listen, this ends here. Let me handle this the right way. Stay here. Okay. Okay. Look, Renee. I just wanna get out of here. Fuck. Drop it, Penda. Or the next one's in your head. Don't worry. He knows you're with me now. In the end to a stunning trial that riveted the public and amounted to revelations of deep-seated corruption in the Swinton Police Department, a jury handed down their verdict of guilty to Sergeant Kesper for the crime of conspiracy in the murder of DeMarco Branz. The trial began after a video recorded on the body cam of the late Officer Daniel Holledge came to light, revealing involvement of fellow officers Kevin Ganning, Gabe Roberts and Dario Penda. In brief comments after the trial, Officer Renee Lomito said she was just doing her duty.
