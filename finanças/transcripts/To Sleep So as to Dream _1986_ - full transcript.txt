Please help us. I will send someone to you. You are the only one we can trust. Who was that? Well, I wonder who... THE ETERNAL MYSTERY - FINALE - The Black Mask is about to reveal the mystery. Who are you and what do you want? Madame Sakura, that is, Madame Cherry-Blossom of the Moon-Island Family... Greetings! Your lovely daughter, Kikyo, that is Bellflower, who has not been home since yesterday, is in good hands... ours. You're the one who called? We have a great favor to ask of you. If you wish Kikyo to safely return, we want you to hand over one million yen to us. One million yen! But let's not be so boorish. Let us first ask you a little riddle. Until tomorrow, Bellflower will be at the place I will now describe to you. Please have one million yen delivered to the following location. Listen carefully... "The Star Wheel in the Flower where the General Tower is seen.” Do you understand? Oh, what will become of our beautiful Bellflower? From M. Pathé & Co. Do you know this "M. Pathé & Co."? So what should I do? You want the riddle solved? And Bellflower found? You're joking! What's the pay? One million yen! Kobayashi, that's the ransom. The rest when we've solved the case. Where the General Tower is seen. In the Flower. Star Wheel. Kobayashi! Eggs! General Tower! Want me to go get more eggs”? But can he solve the riddle? GENERAL JINTAN DIGESTIVE DROPS Something for your trouble. General? Jintan? General? Jintan? The General Tower! The Jintan Tower! It's in Asakusal Let's go! You really think this is it? GENERAL JINTAN TOWER There's nobody here. What's that over there? Something's turning. It's the Flower House. The amusement park? Flower House. Flower? Where the General Tower IS seen. In the Flower? Bellflower can't be here. FLOWER HOUSE If this is the Flower, then what is the Star Wheel? Have you found her? Don't you hear her? Stars! The Stars Wheel! Oh, well done! Well done! Did you enjoy solving our little riddle? But Bellflower is not here. She's here with us, having a good time, singing away just like this. However... our M. Pathé & Co. Has, since yesterday, grown increasingly ambitious, and now wishes to ask you for a higher ransom. Please be good enough to add on top of your one million yen... another million yen, and kindly have it brought to us. Our gyroscope will tell you where we are. The time limit expires tomorrow. Our gyroscope spins the future. The place you seek... where could it be? Not going to get any sleep? You want us to continue...? Is Bellflower really safe? At least till tonight. What will we do? Let's ask the gyroscope. THE TOP SHOP Oh, a spinning top. You find these at fairs. There's a fair at Moon-Island Shrine. THE TOP SHOP M. Pathé & Co.! What are they up to? M. PATHE & CO. PROFESSOR JAROWSKI FROM THE BRITISH EMPIRE So this is what "asking the gyroscope" means, is it? What's wrong? It's too obvious. Could it be a trap? You follow those two. I'll follow the box. We'll meet back here. How do you like our Pathé gyroscopes, sonny? Uotsukal! Are you from Pathé? We have duly received the two million yen. Just as we told you, the gyroscope showed you where to go. Sorry for the rough treatment, but it was the easiest way to bring you here. Forgive us. Hand over Bellflower as you promised! We regret we cannot. You mean Bellflower is...? Don't worry. She's in good health. That song proves nothing! Don't move! You're not going any place! We're taking Bellflower to the next location. If you want her back, Mr. Uotsuka, then your eagerness and another one million yen will be required. Go to the next place, which is... No next place! It finishes here. Please hurry! Solve the riddle and save me! I've been here for 50 years of cherry blossoms. Soon, I will fall asleep. Please find me quickly. Save me from this endless story. THE ELECTRIC HOUSE Found her? M. Pathé & Co? And the two million yen? They took both the money and Bellflower. Both? "The Electric House"? What's that? Bellflower wrote this. So you met Bellflower? The Electric House. Yet another mystery word? I've had enough of this! It's time to give him this. You want me to continue...? They're not after the money. Use this if they're not really after the money. Do you happen to know this place? The Electric House? I heard there used to be a theater called that in Asakusa years ago... That must be it. Asakusa, yes? I assure you, Bellflower and the money will be saved, if this whole thing isn't just a dream. The old lady at the comb shop seems to know everything. Everything? It used to be where they showed movies in the old days. Bantsuma, Chiezo, Arakan... All the old-time matinee idols. Where was it? Back there. For the one you love. How can we look for some place that's no longer here? There has to be a clue around here somewhere. THE ELECTRIC HOUSE THE ELECTRIC HOUSE, ASAKUSA One adult, 20 sen. Two adults, 40 sen. What is this place? What did we pay for? I don't know! Don't think about it. FEATS OF AGILITY ACROBATS MOVIE - THE ETERNAL MYSTERY And now, the movie! I wish to welcome you all here today. Akagaki, your benshi, wishes to thank you. Thank you. That's the Pathé voice! You are about to see our very first actress, Miss Cherry-Blossom, in The Eternal Mystery. Miss Cherry-Blossom! I will explicate the story according to its parts. Please enjoy it to the very end. THE ETERNAL MYSTERY - FINALE - The Black Mask foresaw the Riddle of the Top. He has now cornered the villains. He is doing so in order to rescue the Princess Bellflower. To the right and left appear the White Masks and their Magical Swords. The Black Mask fights bravely on. Ah! Danger! It's Mr. Uotsukal "Stop fighting. "If you want her back, "then pay us one million ryo more. "Farewell!” "Stop there!” The Black Mask has let the villains get away, but it was only so he could follow and find the Princess and the money. This was his ingenious scheme to release both the Princess and the fortune. "Ah, Bellflower, Bellflower, where are you?" "One more step and you are dead men!” Lightning flashes, thunder rolls, and then the roar of battle! Sensing her beloved nearby, Bellflower tries to tell him where she is, and sings her song with all her heart. "I have tracked you down! You cannot escape!” "Do not attempt to resist." "Release the Princess!" "Release her at once!" "The mystery has been solved..." Stop the projection! Stop filming! CENTRAL CINEMA CONTROL, ARTICLE 12 ACTRESSES ARE DEEMED DELETERIOUS TO PUBLIC MORALS. IT IS FORBIDDEN TO PRODUCE OR SHOW SUCH FILMS. Mr. Uotsuka, Mr. Uotsuka... This is just a pub. Moon. Bellflower. Cherry-Blossom... Where are we going? To Cherry-Blossom's house. Eh? But we still haven't found Bellflower? Bellflower is there. Arrange the flowers, important guests are coming. This is going to be a most pleasant evening. I don't need it, I feel quite calm. Bellflower... No, Cherry-Blossom, you can stop the charade now. That's not your line! Don't you understand? Your line is: "You cannot escape!" Say it! Action! That's it, you're doing fine! "Do not attempt to resist!" "Release the Princess!" Say it. Cherry-Blossom, what do you want? Clouds of blossoms swirl, harbingers of a joyful spring. Spring, spring arrives from the south. Oh, the tragic destiny of the captive Bellflower. The Black Mask runs to rescue her. His sword flashes in the dark. The Eastern Mountains sleep in peace. Clashing swords break midnight's silence. "Release her at once!" "The mystery has been solved." Now comes the climax of our story! Final scene. Action! Good! Are you alright, Princess Bellflower? How long have I waited for the end of this story? Finally, my first film, fifty years later, is about to be finished. Bellflower will be rescued at the end, will she not? Thank you, everyone. Mr. Uotsuka, did the Black Mask love his Bellflower? Thank you. Now I am fulfilled... I feel so well, as though I were dreaming. I shall sleep now. Cherry-Blossom! Bellflower!
