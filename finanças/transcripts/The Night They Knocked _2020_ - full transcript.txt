Bill, can you get that? [Radio DJ And good morning, I am Shane Reagan with WPTA Lehigh High Valley News. Our top story this morning, a couple vanishes mysteriously, leaving behind a litany of clues, including a blood-soaked home in complete disarray. The horrifying scene in the quiet town of Hazelton has police baffled. Hazelton police are investigating what they believe is a home invasion. Early on Thursday morning, police responded to a welfare check on a home on the 1200 block of Stockton Mount Road. Upon arriving at the scene, police discovered the home ransacked and blood-soaked. Damn, people are crazy, man. [Radio DJ It is believed by authorities, at this time, that they are missing. Anybody got music? You don't have your phone? I'm waiting on a call. You can use mine, here. So who else is gonna be there? Dom and Alyssa are already at the house, and Dom brought his brother Derrick. Oh, I didn't know he had a brother. He cool? Couldn't tell you, never met him. You guys make him sound so mysterious. You said you were waiting on a call? Yeah. I mean, yeah. That was shady as shit. Aw, baby, no, everything is good. I'm just waiting on a call from Coach, that's all. Okay. Season starts in three weeks. You nervous? Hell no, you're looking at an All-American wide receiver right here, baby. ♪ We can't control our heads alone ♪ ♪ I've got this crisis in my soul ♪ Where the hell are these guys? They said they'd be here a half an hour ago. My phone's upstairs. You gonna call them? I'll give them a little bit. It's fucking Tariq. He'd be late for the fucking draft. So, you excited to graduate? Yeah, I guess. You guess? You're graduating college, that's fucking exciting, Dom. Really? I just get done saying you're gonna graduate, and you pass me this? So disappointing. Come here. Oh, could this be them? Okay, 25 minutes. All right, that means we got time. Yo. What's up, you need something? No, I'm good, getting some water. Starting early, are we? Yeah. You might wanna light a candle or something, man. I can smell that shit from the garage. Yeah, we don't have any. How's the quad coming along? Good. It's up and running if you wanna take it for a spin. No, I'm drinking, so. I know, dummy. I'd be driving. Anyway, I don't know if Alyssa looks like the quad type. Derrick, my friends are coming over soon. Yeah, yeah, I get it. I'll make sure to clean up or stay outside. Best not to make your friends think your brother's a grease monkey, right? - This place is beautiful. - Yes, it is. Dom's parents own it, but one day it'll be his. - Oh, hey. - Hello. Oh. Hello, ladies. - Hey, how's it going? - Hey. How you doing, - how was the drive? - Good to see you. - Good to see you. - Not too bad. - It was long, yeah. - It was long? We took bets on whether or not you'd be here when you said. Oh, fuck you both! Seriously? Do you wanna see the kitchen? - Yes, please. - That sounds good. Let's check it out. Ah, look at these guys, come on in! - What's up, beautiful? - What's up? - How are you? - Come on, let's do the tour. Nah, fuck the tour. Where's the weed at? It's in here. Wow! Call the master bedroom! All right, here we are. We got Tariq, Jess, you guys are right here. Oh, shit! Yeah. It's nice. I mean, it's just a room, so relax. You guys, over here. God, this house is huge. Jake, Carmen, we got you guys bunk beds because we don't like you that much. We have Christmas trees. I call top bunk! Hey, Dom, have you seen my charger? Yeah. We're in the forest. - Get off! - No, it's mine. - No, I called the top bunk. - It's mine. Towels, wash cloths. What the fuck is in here? What's up, you've been quiet all day. Oh, I'm just tired. My finals are killing me, and this fucking phone battery is awful, too. You wanna take a nap or something? I will. I'm just gonna go to the bathroom. Are you napping or smoking, or what are you gonna do? After my call, baby. Think it'll be hard? No. I think it'll be scary, not hard. Isn't that the same thing? No, I don't think so. Well, I mean, I always thought that people are scared to do things because doing things are hard. You know? Especially something like this. All right, look. In a couple of days, we're gonna be far away from here. We're not gonna know anybody, we're not gonna have jobs. Yeah, it'll be scary, but it won't be hard 'cause I got you. I'm okay with that. Well, that's the cheesiest thing you've ever said. Shut up. Take it. What are we gonna tell them? Fuck 'em. There was more weed in that. There was more weed in there. You sure? I mean, how can you be sure? They could've had a look and see what they needed to be seen. No, no, no. No, Coach, listen to me. I need this. If I don't get scouted, I'm fucked. Please, Coach, just make the call and help me out. Please. Motherfucker. Yeah? I'm gonna be cooking dinner in a little bit. You wanna help? Sure, yeah. - Okay, sounds good. - Yep. Hello and good evening, this is Shane Reagan with WPTA Lehigh High Valley News. Breaking news out of Hazelton. There have been multiple reports of mass attacks on residents across the Lehigh High Valley and Pocono Mountains. Local police are responding to several homes across the region that are said to be the subject of homicide investigations. While police are not confirming or denying these reports, they are stressing that residents remain vigilant and seek shelter, if necessary, until further notice. In sports last night, the Butchers defeated the Devils, coming out hungry in the first period, scoring two goals in the first 10 minutes of regulation. The Devils had their best defense out there, with goalie Jason. Fuck. Where's Derrick? Did he steal that, too? All right, relax. I noticed how he was in there, Dom. Well, he's had a rough time. Look, you don't have to be his friend. You just have to be his brother. What the fuck is that supposed to mean It means that it's okay to love someone and not necessarily like them. It's how most families are nowadays. Where were you? I went for a walk. What are you, my fucking PO? I'll be at the house getting dinner ready. Your girl seems nice. Stop that. Stop what? She does, she's about as nice as a fucking at-home vasectomy. It's not like that. Don't make me into a fuck, Dom. I know when somebody doesn't like me. Shaping up to be a great weekend, isn't it? Yeah, listen, it was either this or you spend the weekend with Mom and her shitty mainline friends, so take your pick. I'm not mad at you. You got a funny way of showing it. Yeah. Well, I'm not. What is it then? Why are you moody? Is it me? Is it Alyssa? Is it my friends? What is your problem? You really wanna get into this now? Yeah, I don't want you being like this all weekend. Sometimes, I just feel like you never appreciated it. Three years, Dom. Three years I sat in a jail cell, and I had one day a week to have visitors. Had Mom, had Dad. I know that fucking killed him, Mr. Fucking Mainline, slumming in the slammer to see his son. But at least he came, he still did visit me. But not my brother, no. He was too busy being Mr. Fucking Scholar. Yeah, I didn't wanna see you like that. Fuck you. You were my brother. You were my partner, and I needed you, and you weren't fucking there! I told you, I was sorry about that. I knew you were sorry, man. I wasn't asking you to be sorry. I was just asking you to fucking be there. Three years, Dom. I get out two weeks ago, and now is the first I'm seeing of you. Imagine that. I had finals, Derrick. I'm almost done with school. I have a lot on my fucking plate. Yeah, I can tell. Hey. We'll talk later, all right? Yeah. Where's Jess? She was supposed to be helping. Well, you got us. I'm worried about her. Usually, she is the life of the party. Truth be told, I don't think I've seen her in one place this long without a drink, so. Yeah. Yo, Columbus, you wanna help me out for a sec? Yeah, what do you want me to do? Take these plates and set the table. Okay. She sure keeps a tight leash on that one, huh? Sure. Hey. Guys, sorry, what can I do for you? Just sit down and relax. It looks like Jake and Carmen have got this one. Oh, yeah, you want a drink? - No, no. - What, no, come on, it's the weekend. No, you know, my stomach has kind of been bothering me. Okay, ginger ale then? Sure. Have you ever gotten lost up here? - No, not yet. - This is so good. I'm gonna go for a hike tomorrow and I want all of you lunatics to figure, yeah, you have to find me. Do you know your way around here? What? Is there a good trail to take? Guys, we're almost done. I wanna propose a toast. Dom, Alyssa, thank you guys for doing this. To college finally being over. Cheers, cheers, cheers. Guys, we're almost done. It's been four years. Do you remember when we first met, the first week of college. The girl, what was her name? I can't remember. It doesn't matter, I don't know her name. Okay, so this girl, Sequin Girl, we'll call her, comes into our dorm room. It's like the first week of school, like seven o'clock, like not even party time yet, you know? She comes in and she's like wobbling around. She smells like a homeless person or something, I don't know. But she comes in and we're like, "Hello." And then she just pauses and she's like, and then decides at that moment that she's gonna vomit all over my bed. - Pukes all over my bed. - Come on, babe, babe. - It's funny, it's funny. - We're eating right now. She pukes all over my bed. I mean, she was an absolute mess, so. What, yeah, she was a mess. - It was disgusting. - First week of school. - First week of school. - Welcome to college. What, welcome to college, right? I know. She's disgusting, and that girl, she's gonna be a doctor. Are you kidding? Six months, she's gonna be a doctor. I'd be dead a fucking year before I got treated by any of the motherfuckers I went to school with. Yeah, absolutely. I'm not talking to any of them ever again. I mean, I'll talk to you guys. This wine is like primo, by the way. It's really good. So, you were in prison? Stop. Yeah. What were you in for? Tariq, man, maybe it's... No, no, no, he's good, he's a grown-ass man. Let him talk. No, it's all good, man. I tried to steal a car. Oh, shit! A GTA? How'd you get caught? Friend and I were caught by the owner. Well, at least you took it for a joyride, right? Nope. Caught. Dead to rights. What? And your friend? He got away. Damn, you thought you had a ride-or-die friend, huh? But you seem like a badass motherfucker to me. On that note, I got some more shit to do in the garage. Thank you again for dinner. Delicious. What? You're a fucking asshole, you know that? Well, that was awkward. So are we getting fucked up or what? Yo. What the fuck is this? Our guests are here and, fortunately, still alive. Is your face on yet? I took two. What? I took two. One positive and one negative. I'm really nervous because I don't wanna lose Tariq. Oh, honey, look, you're not gonna lose Tariq, okay? I'm sure he'll be happy, I mean, really. No, no, no, don't tell me that, Coach, please. It doesn't matter, that's the one I need, that's the fucking one I needed, Coach! Well, if you wasn't so worried about yourself and everybody else, we would got somewhere, you motherfucker! Oh, shit, really? Whose is it? This guy I met at my internship. We were out a couple months ago, and one thing led to another. Jesus Christ. Is he, you know? Jesus, really, black, is he black? Shit. I mean it could be Tariq's. Yeah, and I mean that's if you're pregnant, too. I mean, come on. I had a friend in high school, she had to take four tests and go to the gyno. Okay, thanks, guys. I just gotta go to the bathroom. Yeah, you keep your head up, babe. So, what happened? - To who? - To your friend. Yeah, she had triplets. The girls seem to be having a good time. Yeah, man, Carmen's having a good time for sure. Yeah, I think Alyssa's having fun, too. It seems like they're getting along well. Yeah. They make good pasta together. - Yeah. - They should go pro. I don't know if there's a pro for that, but yeah. Dude, there's a pro for everything. That's debatable. You'll slip up one of these days. You think so? Y'all looking to burn? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yes, us. Fucking assholes! That one. Dude, shut the fuck up. All right, which one of you banged on the door? What do you mean, babe? Who banged on the door? It scared the shit out of me! None of us banged on the door. We were out. Was it Derrick? Come on, Jesus Christ, what the fuck? Can I talk to you outside for a minute? Here we fucking go. Damn. Poor bastard. I can't do this no more. I can do it. What the fuck was that? Okay, I'll day I've been hearing you talk about him with that fucking tone in your voice. Oh, a tone? Yeah, a tone, a bitchy tone. So, you know what, you want people to like your brother, well, maybe he should've thought about that before going to prison, before stealing that car, or before stealing any of the cars, for that matter. Look, I know you love your brother, I do, but you need to understand that I'm a little worried when he's around, I'm worried about my purse, my phone, my keys. I mean, you can't blame me for that. Yeah, do you worry about that stuff with me? No, because you're not a... I'm not a criminal, ex-con. Look, that friend that he was with, it was me. - What? - Yeah. I stole that fucking car, and he took the blame for it. So before you go pass judgment on something that you don't know a fucking thing about, okay, maybe look around. You might actually see something that surprises you. Why? 'Cause I lost my fucking grant money, I failed two classes, and I was put on probation, okay, that's why. You told me you were on the Dean's List. Yeah, well, I fucking lied. Dom, your parents aren't broke. I mean, you could've gone to your dad and asked for some kind of help, I mean... Yeah, I didn't, okay? Last thing I wanna be known for is living off my parents like every other fucking mainline douche bag, everything handed to them on a fucking platter. You having a future that's secure, that's a bad thing? Yeah, okay? Maybe it is. Look, I just gotta go. I have to be alone right now. Fuck. I told you she didn't like me. There is no way we're letting that ruin our night. Well, I haven't seen Jess all night, so I'm gonna head upstairs and do the boyfriend thing. Hey, babe, I can't find my phone anywhere. I think I left it in the jeep. Are you sure? I don't see it here. All right. I'll get it. Thank you! Okay. Okay. I didn't think you'd tell her. I got tired of hearing her shit on you like that, constantly. I felt like a hypocrite. And it pissed me off. Don't let it. I deserve it. I'm sorry for running that night. Don't be. Don't be. You only ran 'cause you had the chance to, and nobody would have expected anything else. We were both caught, dude. Yeah, but only one of us hit a cop. Look, I had three years to think about what I did. And, at the end of the day, I wouldn't change a fucking thing. I love you, man. Hey, fuck boy. What the fuck was that? Baby girl. Come on, baby. Jess. What's wrong with you? Nothing. I just think I had a little too much to drink, that's all. Jesus, it's not even midnight yet. Hey, where's my phone? Mine should be. It's not here, babe. What the fuck are you doing? Seriously? What are you doing? Was anybody up here? No, it's just been me. Was Derrick up here? Tariq, come on, stop. Nah, yo, the only person I don't know who happens to be an ex-con, and my phone is missing? Am I stupid? Yeah. Tariq. Tariq. Thanks for dinner, Alysssa, thanks for cooking, Alyssa. You fucking took my phone! Yo, Tariq, what the fuck? He took my fucking phone! Took your phone? - I didn't take your phone. - Calm down. Bullshit, where the fuck is my phone at? Tariq, stop. Yo, calm down, he was with me. Your brother's a convict. - What? - Relax. You're a convict, what's up then? The fucking balls on you. Well, do something, pussy. You motherfucker. Get the fuck outta here. The fuck was that? Oh, that's probably Jake. Jake? Yeah, he went outside to grab my phone. Jake, no, no, no. Somebody help me. Baby, no, baby, no, no, no. You ever touch me again, I swear I'll fuck you up. No. Somebody, please. Oh, God! Derrick! Oh, Jesus Christ! Dom, fucking help me, man. What the fuck, man? Tariq, go get Alyssa! Tariq, go get Alyssa! Yo, Alyssa. Jess, watch the back door! We have to bolt the back door! There's another one back here! Alyssa. Fuck! Shit! Alyssa. Jesus fucking Christ. Shove. Knock, knock. Knock, knock. I said fucking knock, knock! Hey, fuck you, man, we're calling the cops. What are you gonna call them with? With this? You're gonna call them with this? How about this one? No? Oops. This one, definitely, right? Or this one, aw. All right, now we can break the glass. But where the fuck is the fun in that? No, you kids are gonna have to figure it out. Are we gonna come in and get you or are you gonna play the game? Take a look around. Ain't nobody coming for you. Jess, Jess, you get the door? Where's Alyssa? What? She's upstairs, I saw her go up there. - I didn't see her. - Alyssa! - Dom, Dom, Dom, Dom. - She's gotta be fucking upstairs! Man, there's two of them and four of us! Stop it. Who are they? This isn't happening, I'm here. Please, man, fuck, please. Fucking stop that shit, Dom, stop it. - She's gotta be up there. - Stop it! Stop, stop, stop, stop. What is happening? I'm here, I'm here. Does anybody have a fucking phone? They have your phones. Look, we don't got time for this shit, man! They have your phones. What? They have your fucking phones! How? I don't fucking know! Well, do you have a landline or something? No. There's no way, there's no way. - Fuck, man. - There's no way what? There's no way they got all your phones from out there. What the fuck are you talking about? I'm talking about searching the fucking house! Oh, shit. Oh, God. Come into the corner. Calm down, sweetie, just calm down. Shut the fuck uP! You can't tell me to shut the fuck up. We gotta search upstairs. Fuck that shit, for what? How do you think they ended up with all your fucking phones? I was just upstairs, cellblock, ain't nobody up there. We gotta find Alyssa. Dom, I know, and we will, but right now, we've gotta be smart. First things first, we gotta find Dad's shotgun. Y'all got a shotgun, you're not fucking using it? Dad came up last week and took it 'cause he knew you were gonna be here. Fuck. He knew it wouldn't have been a good idea if there was an ex-con and a gun in the house. If I die because you wanna steal a fucking car. Hey, shut the fuck up, T. Hey. Okay. Okay. Is everybody good? As good as I'm ever gonna get. Yes. Jess, listen to me, you listening? I should have said nothing was gonna happen. Get out of here. Try to keep it cool, man. No, man, I should have never said anything to her. If I didn't say anything, she wouldn't have gone upstairs. She'd be here, scared out of her fucking mind. You don't know where she is. You don't know what she did. She could've got pissed at something I said or uttered, so she's taken off, I don't know, taken off. No, man. Her phone. Her phone was in that pile, right next to mine. Look, let's just focus on getting outta here, okay? The quad. The quad, I can get to the quad and jump on it, I can get help. I can go, I'm faster. That's just fucking fantastic, man. Is Jess as fast as you? Better yet, can you see in the dark? You can't see your hand in front of your fucking face out there. Listen, I'm trying to help out. You don't have to be a fucking asshole. Oh, shit. Jess, I need you to calm down, okay? All right, fuck faces, back to work. Derrick, what are we gonna do? I don't know, I don't know. We should go check it out. Bro, come on, let's just get outta here. [Derrick[ All right, fine... No, we're staying right fucking here. What if it was Jess, man? What the fuck would you do? Jess, Jess, I'm sorry, just clam down, okay? What if she's out there, what if they have her? You didn't see them just kill somebody? Shut the fuck up. Get up. Come on, man, you serious? Fuck. What was that? Did you hear that, what was that? Get behind me. Lights! - Dom! - No! - No, you can't! - No, I'm sorry, it's a trap! They think they're gonna help you. Come on, guys, stop! What the fuck are you doing? That's my best friend out there. We need to help her! I'm sorry, we can't. We can't, brother, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, brother, we can't. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry, brother. It's okay, brother. Calm down, brother, it's okay. One, two, three, eyes on me. Aren't you gonna let us in? Who's gonna be the hero? How about you, blondie? Fuck you! Is that your final answer? Well, is it? Then let's begin. Look at her. She looks good, doesn't she? Let the young blood have one last ride. Alyssa, no! No, no, that's my friend, no! I know, I know. No, we have to do something! We have to do something! We have to, no! As much as I love watching you crazy kids argue like there's no tomorrow, and, trust me, for you, there isn't, I still need an answer, though. No! Good. I wanted to make sure that we could all see one another, especially for this. - Oh, baby, I'm so sorry. - Oh, baby, I'm so sorry. Shut the fuck up. Say ah. No! There we go. No, no! Oh, God! It's okay, bro, it's okay. Look at her trying to breathe. It's okay, brother. Oh, fuck! It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay. Oh, God! Don't look, Dom, I'm sorry, man. Let me make this perfectly clear. This was your doing. Alls you had to do was open the door so we could have some fun. You kids better hold on tight, 'cause it's gonna be a long night, and we're just getting started. Get her legs. Get the stakes. Why are they doing this to us? They don't need a reason. Come on, enough of that shit, man. It's true, they don't. Whether we open that door or not, she was still gonna die. We could've tried, Derrick. Dom, we don't know how many were out there, man. If they wanted in, they could've broken a door or a window or something, man. They just wanna fuck with us. Look, it doesn't matter to them how they get in or when, they just wanna fuck with us until we break. You want a reason, that's the best I got. We still gotta check upstairs. How far is the garage? The garage is right there, man, but what are you gonna do, bust out that door? I can do it. I can like draw their attention, I'm fast, - I can get there fast. - I know you're fast.
