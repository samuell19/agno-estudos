Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It is my pleasure on behalf to the crew to welcome you aboard this flight. If there is anything we can do to make your flight more comfortable, please do not hesitate to ask. To prepare for take-off, you must now close your tray tables... - Excuse me, ma'am. You need to take a seat. I need to get past. I'm sorry. Ooh! - Sorry. - Ma'am. - Get away from the door. Take your hands off it. I'm sorry. I need to get off. No. Take your hands off the door. Take your hands off the door, please. Ooh! - Is everything OK? - Are you all right? - Can you please just settle down? Settle down. - No, no. - It's all right. Just keep breathing. It's all right. Do you want me to call ahead? I-I can't breathe. I'm having a heart attack. - It's all right. - I can't breathe. Let me off! Let me off! - You're not having a heart attack. Yes, I am! Please. Let me off! Shh. - There's one tomorrow for 2223. - What?! OK, I can't- Um... Is there some kind of compensation scheme? - No. We only cover for critical medical situations. - This was a critical medical situation. - No, you chose to get off the plane, so... - OK. Ah, I didn't- I didn't choose to get off the plane; I had to get off the plane because of an emergency. Because of my health. I think, actually... it could have been the salmon wrap that was... prepared for me in the food court here by a- an airport employee. I felt sick. - Happens more often than you think. - They should stop serving the salmon wrap, then. No, panic attacks. I didn't have a panic attack. - The first-aid officer said that you- - No. I didn't have a panic attack, OK? It was the salmon wrap... that was... OK. What's the... just the cheapest flight that you have? - There's one day after tomorrow for 1900. My name is Millie Davies, and I want to be a world-class architect. I think I've always known that it's something that I want to do with my life. I've definitely always had a fascination with the way that our environment, uh, impacts the way that we interact with one another. It's pretty exciting. I'm actually gonna be interning at Rowden & Cunnane, which is one of New York's, like, top architecture firms. They're actually one of the top firms in the world. So, I suppose, from the experience, I'm hoping to develop my skills and represent New Zealand at a global level. This is an epic opportunity to move on and advance and grow, step into the next chapter of my life. As a part of my internship, I'm going to be, uh, documenting my experience on Instagram. So, uh, stay tuned and watch this space. My Instagram handle- - Millie Poo. - Hey, B. How's it going? - Hey! How are you? - Yo. - What's happening? Where are you? - Uh... I'm just- I'm just in lay- in layover right now. Yeah. - Oh my God. That is so exciting. It's- It's pretty- It's pretty ultra. - Yeah! - Um... Hey, I was actually... - What's up? - ...wanting to call. - Mm-hm. - You- You know how I told you that I was all good and to just take your time paying me back for my car? I was wondering whether may- Yeah, could I- could I please actually get that money off you kind of soonish? - Oh. Um... I mean... no. Not right now. Is that OK? - Are you serious? - I'm so sorry, but... I'm still broke, babe. I actually am. - I'm so sorry. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. OK. - But, hey. Hey, I have some really good news. I have a job interview with Roger Walker tomorrow. - Yay! Oh my gosh. Cool. Oh, I know! I know. - I didn't think it was gonna happen, so... Yeah. Hope I get it. - Yeah, that's awesome. I'm really happy for you. Hey, I've got to go. Uh, they're- they're boarding my flight right now, but, uh, lots of love. Oh, OK. Good luck with your interview. And I'll talk to you later, K? - Oh. Yeah. - OK. Sweet. Awesome. - Hey, hey, hey. - Yo. - Hey, I'm... I'm so happy for you, OK? You really deserve this, all right? Right. You're gonna be amazing. Thank you. - All right? - OK. - OK. Talk soon. All right. Have a safe flight, babe. - Bye. - Bye. - So, there's nothing- there's literally nothing you can do? I really, really need to get a bigger overdraft. OK. What about my credit card? Oh, yeah. No, not that card. On my other credit card. - Going for a loan? - Yes, please. OK. Big one? Small one? Uh, just a small one, thanks. - Small one. So, 10 grand? - Ah, two grand. - Two grand? - Yeah. Uh, assets? Items of value? - Yeah, hang on. Let me check. - No, no. Items of value like a... car. - Yeah... I used to, but I don't any more. - So you don't have a car? - No. - OK. Uh, I tell you what - if that changes, give me a call. Steve, Money in a Hurry. - OK. Thank you. Hello. Hi, everyone. Hello. Uh... Obviously, uh, we know, um, why we're all here - um, cos, uh- cos Millie's leaving. And, um... Yeah. Just have a clap for Millie. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. - Yeah, Um, I'm gonna- I'm gonna miss you a lot. Yeah, I'll miss you too. - Um... And not sure what we'll do without you, but- but she'll be right, right? Anyway, um... Yeah. Miss you, obviously, but, um... I mean, if you're gonna leave, you're probably gonna need this, right? OK. OK. I'm gonna- - You need to give that back about now. - Nah, nah. I think you need to come get it yourself. Oh! Oh, shit! OK. OK. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. - Oh, shit. - ♪ Yeah, I really struggle when my good friends leave. ♪ ♪ Millie, I will miss you so. ♪ ♪ I wish you didn't have to go. ♪ ♪ Millie, I will miss you so. ♪ ♪ I wish you didn't have to go. ♪ Go, Carolyn! - See, I told you I'd write you a little song. Oi! Don't film them. - Bye! - Bye. - See ya! See ya. - Love you. - Hello. - Hi, Mum. - What's wrong? - Can I not just call you up? - Well, you can. So you made it? - Yes. I made it. - You were on the news tonight. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Did they give you a makeover? You didn't look like you. - I did look like me because it was me, and that's what I look like. Actually, I'm calling you because... I left my laptop... in the airport in Hong Kong, and I really need it for my internship. - Oh no! - Yeah. I know. - Oh, love, I'm not working until my leg gets better. I'm on a shoestring diet till then. - Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. - But... No. I'll give you what I can. - No way, Mum. Don't be crazy. It's fine. Don't worry about it. - Oi! - Millie, I'll find a- - Hi. - We're closed for the year. - I'm actually an ex-student. I just graduated and have come to check on my project. - You Carolyn? - Yeah. - Very similar, these two, aren't they? - I don't see that. - Really? - Yeah. - I mean, it's pretty clear that this... Millie - I mean, her work is very clearly derivative of yours. - Sure it's not the other way around? - Yeah. I mean, yours just has a certain je ne sais quoi. - It's probably, you know, the zeitgeist. - Don't think so. I do think you need to leave, though. Uh, fuck. - He doesn't even know what he's doing! Like... I mean, what the hell?! Like, I just wish they'd cast me in a lead role and give me a chance to, like, prove myself, you know? Like... - Totally, totally. - They just keep giving the best roles to the same three people and, I'm like- - And it's just, like, systemic bullshit and all of that shit. - Yeah, oi. Straight up. I'm just like... Yeah. Like, they just put you in a- in, like, a box of what they think you are, you know? And, um, that's not your job, like... - Yeah. - I'll do that. Like, that's my job. I will define me. - You choose your own plot. - Yeah. Like, that's what I've been, like, doing, um... - Do you need to get that? - Uh... We said no contact for six months. - Well, what about long distance? - Nah, nah, nah, nah. I don't believe in that. Nah. - Nah, nah. - You know, like, she was like, 'What if I stay?' And I said, 'I'm not gonna let you ruin your life for me.' - Oh, fuck. That's really mature. Yeah. - Oi, like, straight up, though. Like, you just have to, like, think about your, um- your partner, and like, not be a... You all good? Who was that? What about you? Yeah. What about you, Carolyn? Uh... When I was 16, my dad took me to New York. - Oh. - Mm-hm! - Right? So... - Yeah. - We went to the Guggenheim. - Mm. - And I just remember thinking that none of the art inside the building was as cool as the building itself. - Mm. - You know? The flow of it all. This... - Yeah. Yeah. - ...spiral climbing into the sky, reaching for, like, the highest ideals of human imagination. - That's awesome. - It's not just a building, really. It's... an experience. - Yeah, definitely. - You should be there. - Yeah, you should be. - Nah. Millie worked really hard. She says it's like an osmosis thing. It's honestly not that uncommon, especially- - Come on! No. Like, last year she randomly got the same shoes as me. - Yeah, I remember that. - And I was like, 'Um... Like, what are the chances?' And she was, like, 'Twinsies!' - Yeah, I'm used to that from her. It's harmless, but, like, this is next level. - Uh-huh. - No. I mean... They'll sniff her out as soon as she gets there, right? So... - Millie! Hey. - Scott, hi. - I thought... I thought you were in New York. - I am. Um... Yeah, tomorrow, first thing. That's why I'm about to boost. I've got to go and hit the bed. Yeah. - Oh, you've just come from the drinks? - Yeah. Wait, why? Are you-? Are you going? - Yeah. Uh, Carolyn invited me, so... - Whoa. That's really, um... brave of you. - What? Why? - Just cos there's, like, a lot of your students who are up there right now, uh, pashing, gyrating. It's a very, um... It's an orgy up there, currently. I mean, if I was in your position, I'd probably be kind of... - Rea- It's... OK . Really? It's that level? Yeah. It's- It's heated. Yeah. - OK - It's heated. - Then this is embarrassing. - Don't be embarrassed about it. These things happen. - No, no, no. I mean, I just... - Yeah, I would stay away. - I dunno. I don't want to be that... that guy. - Um... do you need a lift? - So this is your- the New York bag? - That's the- That's the New York bag. - Wow. That's it? - Yeah. That's my stuff. I moved out of my flat tonight. - OK. Um, where are you staying? - I'll probably just crash here in the car. - In the car? - Yeah. - Your car. What? - Yeah. - That is so bleak. Millie, you can't do that. It's not. It's not that bleak. No, no. I can't accept that. You, um... You can crash on the mezzanine. - Scott, it's fine. - Seriously. Don't worry about it. It's no worries. And I owe ya for saving my arse tonight. Kim's not there - my wife. We're having a little bit of a, um... Yeah. I mean, just so you know, it's not... not, um... Yeah. Just so you don't get there and go, 'Oh, 'where's his wife?' - Yeah. Cool. - Yeah. So it's not... So it is not weird. Mm. Yeah. A weird fascination of mine - horses. Obsessed when I was a kid and, yeah, that lead to architecture. Obviously not directly. Um... Do you want a joint? - Oh, no, thanks. I'm good. I went horse trekking once as a kid, and, uh, I was really scared and the horse could, like, tell. - Oh, they know. - Yeah. They know. And it bucked me off, so now I have a bit of a phobia of... horses now, actually. So... - Oh. - Yeah. - Yeah. OK. Yeah. Sorry about all the hooves. So, you're- you're from Wellington? - Yeah. - Did you-? Sure you don't want some? - OK. Yeah, sure. - So you grew up here? No, I didn't. So where did you, uh, grow up? - Uh, I grew up in different places - all around. - Right. OK. - Mm. - But, like, uh... where were you born? Oh. - Thanks. I was born in the Philippines. - Oh. You're from the Philippines? - I'm not from there; my parents just worked there for a while. - Wow. What do they do? - They were missionaries, but I'm not religious or anything like that. - Wow. That's fascinating. - Not really. - So, why architecture? What was the initial spark for you? Not horses? - No, not horses. - Oh. Not wearing my teacher's hat. - Uh... I think it was when I was 16. So, my mum... took me to the Guggenheim. And I just remember thinking, 'None of the art in here 'is as cool as the building itself,' you know? Like, this spiral staircase ascending... to the heights of human imagination. It's not a building. It's- It's a whole experience. - Mm. - Mm. - I see you. - What? - I see you. - I-I see you. - No. I see you. - Oh, OK. I think I might know what's happened here. - Just getting a bit of déjà vu over here. - Do you think maybe you've heard Carolyn say something similar? Wow. Cos we were there, together, at the same time. We were both at the Guggenheim together. And I was like, 'We should both study architecture.' And she was like, 'Yeah, I was thinking that too. 'You're just the one who voiced it.' - Right. Yeah. - Mm. - That makes sense. You guys are... really similar, eh? - Your work, right? I mean, it happens - osmosis. - I say that all the time. Osmosis. - Mm. You have to figure out your own point of view. Like, what makes your work unique, do you think? Like, what makes you, you? Oh. Um... I'm gonna take that... Yep. Oh, that was- Yeah. I was just trying to... Oh. Here we... Hello. Yep. Hey. - I just forgot the, um... - Yeah. Ah, yeah. So- Oh, OK. So, that's Millie, and this is my wife, Kim. - Hi, Kim. - Hi. - It's- Yeah. It's not like, uh, last time. Did you-? How is everything? Good? Great. - Yeah. Millie. Yeah. I was about to, um... - All right. Thank you so much, Scott. I'm gonna boost. Yeah. Thank you. You have such a beautiful home. - Yeah... - Thank you. - Hey! - Hey! Where my party people at? Where my party people at? - Hey! Have a drink, Mills. Have a drink. - It's good to see that life is still going on without me. You got there fast. - Yeah. Yeah. It was a really strong tail wind. They said it was unusually fast. - How's it all going? - Honestly, it's been so amazing. Yeah. My boss came and picked me up from the airport. We went straight to this rooftop party. - Wow! - I tried cocaine. - Wow. So cool! - Yeah, it was really cool. And it's like I've just been embraced by this amazing New York family. You've changed. - Whatever! - Yeah, but he's right, though, cos you broke our rule. - Actually, I'm calling Carolyn. It's not my fault you happen to be there. So... - Oh yeah. I was joking anyway. - What time is it over there? - I don't even know. Early. Late. What do you guys think of my exposed brick wall apartment? - You've got the Massimo Vignelli up. - Yeah. Why? - You put up a New York poster in New York. - Yeah. I mean... I was just paying homage. I can take it down. Um... Anyway, I'd better go. I'm pretty jet lagged. - Oh. What? - Miss you guys. - Wait, what? - Bye. - Hey. - Oi, Mills. - Steve! Hi. I'm Millie. I came in yesterday. Yeah. I, uh, bought an asset. - And... don't worry about that one unless you're leaving the country. So, I just need you to sign, uh, there. Great. That's us. I'll give you that one. - Cool. - So it's gonna take, uh, 24 hours to process. - Thank you so much. Oh, shit. - Um, hey everyone. Uh, this is just some of, um, Henry's top tips for everyone that's going through a breakup right now. Um... Number one - just surround yourself with- with good people, you know? Like, just, um... Just no haters and no fakers. And, uh, number two - just- just go to the gym, you know? And- And drink some protein and... and- and- Cos if you look good, then- then you feel good. And number three - just get high. Just get high. And number four - uh... just remember that- that the love was real. And, like, don't forget that it's- that it'll always be there. Like- Like, the stars that- that I'm seeing at the moment. And... just... Even if the light fades away, like, the- the stars are always gonna be there. And... I wanna sing a song, but I don't know the lyrics. Oh, fuck. Shit. Hi, there. - $27. - All right. I'm game. I'm game. Here we go. No contact for six months. - You broke first. - Yeah, but that was only because I was... just trying to avoid... - Shut up. Hi, Calvin. - He misses you. - Hey. - Oh! Here, boy. Is that your bedroom? - Yeah. Yeah. - Well, can you give me a tour or what? - Finished. - OK. Um... Oh, that reminds me. Is your... You live at 247, Apartment 3N, First Street in Williamsburg, right? - Yeah. Why? - What, Henry? I'm coming to New York. Um... - What? - I'm coming to New York! - What? - When are you coming to-? - I'm coming tomorrow at 11am. I legit leave here at 11am. I saw it on GrabASeat, and I just- I thought to myself, 'It's meant to be.' Have to! So... I'm coming to New York! Where will you stay? Fuck! - Um, what do you mean where am I gonna stay? I'm gonna stay with you. - What about school? - Nah, fuck school. Some things are more important right now. - Um... - Right? - I just thought that you said we shouldn't ruin our lives for each other, you know? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, well, I did say that, but then I thought about it the next day, and I was just like, nah. Nah, that's stupid. So... - Well, isn't it... romantic? - Yeah. Yeah. It's so romantic. - We could be, like, a power couple of New York - like Jay-Z and Beyoncé, right? - They live there, right? - Uh... I'm not sure, but cool. This is good for us. OK? This is a good thing. I know it's a good thing. I can feel it. It's meant to be, otherwise that GrabASeat wouldn't have came up. - Yeah. - OK. Cool. All right. I'm gonna pack this stuff up, and, um, I'll see you soon OK? - Cool. Yeah. Bye. - Say 'bye', Calvin. Bye. OK. I'll see you soon. - Hi. Asad. Airbnb. - Hi. What happened? Did you change your mind? Is it... something to do with Henry? - No, Mum. - Millie, what happened? - I had to get off the plane. - Why? - Because I felt like I couldn't breathe. My heart was closing down. Everything was just, like... coming towards me. - You had a panic attack. - No, I didn't. I don't get those, Mum. - Millie. - It's fine. - How is it fine? - Because I'm sussing it. - How are you sussing it? How are you sussing it? - I've got money coming, OK? Where from? - Where...? - Don't worry about it. - Yeah, but I am worried. - Well, don't worry about it. - Have you-? Shh. Have you told the architects you're gonna be late? - Yes. - Have you told Carolyn? - Yep. - Henry? - Yes. Millie, this is so silly. - I know that it's stupid. - Shh. - You don't have to tell me how stupid it is. I am well aware of that, so don't go on about it. - You've been here for two days? Why didn't you come to me? - I don't know! - Why?! - I don't know. OK? Maybe- Maybe it's because whenever I do come here, you always make me get up, and you always make me perform, and you always make me do- - Oh, I- - Yes, you do. You always make me do freaking Tinikling for everybody - You love Tinikling. - I do not! I do not love Tinikling. - I don't believe that. - I've never loved it! Well, you're very good at it. Because I had to get good at it because it hurts so much when the bamboo whacks your ankles. But you've never actually just asked me what I wanted and what I've wanted to do, Mum! Oh. - I wanted to be normal, you know? I just- - What's normal? - What's normal is not going around after school doing a freaking culturally appropriated dance... - It is not cultural appropriation. - ...to raise money for your cult. Yes, it is! - It is not a cult! You know, we moved here because of you. We didn't have anything waiting for us back here. - So are you saying that it was actually my fault that I was getting bullied all the time... - Oh, come on! - ...because I didn't belong? - You were expelled. I'm not gonna lie for you. If I see your friends or those architects, I won't lie. - Saint Marlene Uh, hi. This is Millie Davies. Um, I'm just calling to check on the status of my loan. Uh, how- how far away is it? OK, cool. And, uh, is that gonna happen pretty soon? Because you guys did say 24 hours, and your name's Money in a Hurry, so... That would be amazing. OK, cool. Thanks. Bye. - Yo. - Chur! - Oh, yo. Uh... I've got a package here for apartment 17, and I need you to come down and sign for it, so buzz me up, please, bro. - Oh. OK. Ah, hold on. Just- Just coming down now. - I'm getting my arse royally spanked here. - No, you're not. - Where the fuck are they all hiding? Yeah. Ah, there we go. Hi, baby. Hi. I miss you so much. Yeah. - That was weird, man. I'll just get the cage. Yeah. Thanks heaps for doing this as well, eh. You know, I've just got so much to do before I bounce, eh? - No worries. Uh, you know where her mum is, right? - Yep. She knows I'm coming? - Nah. I don't have her number, but, um... Well, he was hers to begin with, so... Ah... Calvin. Calvin. - Calvin. - Here, boy. - Calvin. - Calvin. Calvin. Here, boy. Oh, shit. Hello? Hi. Hi, yes. Yes, it's me. OK. Um... Thanks so much for the opportunity. No. No, that's- that's totally fine. Thanks. Bye. Mum, I didn't get the Roger Walker job. I just blanked. I get so nervous. I had all these things I wanted to say, and I get to the interview, and I... I suck. My life is shit, and I'm lugging around my best friend's bunny. No, no, no. It's- It's fine. It's fine. I should go, I think. I've got a... Um... I'll be fine. OK. Gotta go. Bye. - Hey, baby. I am so sorry to do this right now, but I cannot let Carolyn go to Mum's, OK? This is bigger than you. - Can I borrow your lighter? OK, yeah. What? - Millie. It's Asad from your mum's Airbnb. - Oh, hey, Asad. What's up? - Um... - Oh my God. - No. No, don't. I'm fine. I just- I was up a ladder cleaning windows, and I leaned forward too much. - You're not even supposed to be working, Mum. - Well, an old client called me, and I thought I'd get you some money. It's only a little bit broken. - I'm so sorry. Hello. - Why is Calvin here? - Millie Davies? Millie Davies? - Yeah. - Steve from Money In a Hurry. Look, we're about to process your loan... - Great. - ... and we did a quick background check, and we found an article on Google that says you're leaving the country. If that's true, it's really something that you should have disclosed. Obviously we can't proceed with loan. But if this is all just a misunderstanding, it'd be great to clear... Fuck. Fuck. - What's happened? - Nothing. - Millie. - Nothing. - Millie. Tell me. - You do have the right to cancel this loan within five working days in writing. Now, all I need is your signature right there on the line. There you go. Here is your cash. - Thank you. Much appreciated. - Have a wonderful afternoon. - I can't. - Just... take the money, please. Your dad had anxiety; took medication for it. Used to get panic attacks. - I don't get those. - He insisted that that was his body's way of telling him that something was off. Used to get so conflicted about not bringing you up in New Zealand. He knew what we were doing was important, and... and every now and then it would, you know... it would hit him - was it worth the sacrifice? So many more people worse off than you. He worried about it was doing to your sense of yourself. You and I, of this land. Anyway, we did come home because of you. - Yeah, because I was getting bullied. - Just let me finish. I think... I think he was right. I think we left it too long. By the time we got back, it'd already mucked you up. - Sorry I'm such a disappointment, Mum. - Well, we can't all be appointments. - Take care, Mum. OK? - Tell Carolyn. - I will. - And Henry. - I will. ♪ It's our party; we can do what we want. ♪ ♪ It's our party; we can say what we want. ♪ ♪ It's our party; we can love who we want; ♪ ♪ we can kiss who we want; we can see who we want. ♪ ♪ Red.

Um... - I'm so sorry. - Calvin is with my mum, Carolyn. - Mill. Oi, wait! Where are you going? Wait, Mill! - Millie? - Yeah. - You have one new message. - Hi, Millie. It's, um, Stu here from Richdale Urbanisation Scholarship. Uh... Look, I got a call from R&C saying that you hadn't turned up for your internship yet, uh, which is kind of strange because from your Instagram posts and everything, um.... well, it seems like you're having a great time in New York. So, uh, it'd be great if you just gave us a call, um, just to let us know where you're at. Talk soon. - Hey. - Mm! It's you. - I just got dumped by my future. Who came up with that? This is horrible. Get a van. - Just go and live the dream. - Gonna brew some booch in the- in the hills, in the country. - What is booch? - Kombucha. - Kombucha? - Yeah. - I don't like kombucha. - I fucking hate kombucha. Sorry that I touched your crotch. - Don't apologise. - That was weird, man. - It wasn't. It was a bit weird, but it's fine. Don't worry about it. - Is it my fault, though? - No. It's not your fault, OK? We've tried things like open relationship, blah blah blah. It's just... You know, it's hard when you've got kids. Right? - Yeah. - Also it has happened before. So... I don't know. You know? I don't know. Can I rip your bra off? - Yeah. - I have an idea. - Great. - It's, uh... It's maybe kind of nuts. - I love nuts. All right. I mean, I love nuts. - Can you, um... put something on for me? OK. So, it's, um... Could be, like, fun? Like... OK. - Oh, and, um, don't forget to take your contacts out. Um... All right. Um... How was your day? Oh, you know, same old... same old? Yeah. Do you want-? Oh, did you want something to drink? - Yes. Do you have whisky? I would love a whisky. - Uh, yeah... I was thinking more like tea. Tea or something. - Coffee? - Mm. - Or- Or tea. - Yeah. What kind? Chamomile. - Chamomile. - Great. OK. I... will be back in a tick. OK? - Yeah. - I love you. - So, do you want sugar? Or we have, um... honey. Oh my God. - Millie, I'm so- - I'm sorry about last night. Yeah, so sorry. I'm so sorry. Well, we're sorry. - Sorry. What happened? - I had a panic attack on the plane. - Why didn't you tell us? - How much was your ticket? - How much was your flight? I want to pay you back. - Don't worry about it. - You quit school for me. - Well... If I'm being completely honest, um... school wasn't really working out anyway. And... it's New York. But, uh, I probably would have- would have quit for you. Maybe. Probably. - I'm gonna tell the scholarship people that I copied your ideas. - You don't have to do that. This is a boarding announcement for all passengers on Flight NZ3179 to Los Angeles. Your fight is now boarding. - Hey, it's kind of crack up how you're going now, eh? Yeah. Yeah. Look, I don't know why I do half the shit I do. I'll catch you up. - You still kind of smell like piss. - You know the dance. - Yeah, but I haven't done it for so long. - You know it. - Go on. - I sort of know it. Oh my gosh. Oh. Oh.
