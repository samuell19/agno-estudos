Today is the third happiest day of my life. The first... was the day Valentina was born. The second, the day she started working at the firm. That's where she met Agust?n, one of my best lawyers, and even more important, a good man. Today they got married in the same church that I got married in. Well, Isabel and I. I'm sure that Agust?n will give her the life I always wanted her to have. And finally, the fourth most important day of my life will be the day they give me my first grandchild. I hope it's very soon. Thank you very much. He has no fucking clue. If I ate a crossword, I'd shit a better speech. No, it was great. Arturo! Arturo's my man, I'm his biggest fan. Jesus, that's enough. -No, it was great. -Thanks. Really. Really. You sure got lucky with Valentina's boyfriend. Yeah. I hope my Marta finds a kid who makes her laugh some day. Well, and me too. If he's funny, we're both in the bag. Okay, you've rehearsed. Let's go. Hold on there, Bruce Willis. You're next. I heard Sarai has a boyfriend. No, she doesn't. Sure she does! Arturo! He says Sarai doesn't have a boyfriend. No? No. You would know, you're her dad. Of course I would know. She doesn't. Arturo, hurry up! Everyone's in the church! Here, let's take a selfie. The priest won't let anyone take photos in the church. Arturo, smile back there! -No photos. -There. Don't take my photo, you schmuck! Isabel, please. Don't stick me with these two baboons. But they're your family. They're not my family! They're my brothers-in-law. How are you, sweetie? Fine, a little nervous. Just relax. Today's a day to be relaxed. -Okay. -I'm going to see my sister. Too much cleavage! Sarai, tell me! Is it a girl? If it is, I don't care. Mom, you'll meet him soon enough. Then it's a boy. Here comes your dad. Hey. Have you got a boyfriend? No, no. I don't, Dad, don't worry. Agent Scully. They're waiting for you in the church to play cello. Yes, yes. Agent Mulder, this is Dani. Dani, -Agent Mulder. -Hello. I'm Chus, the little girl's father. Nice to meet you. Anyway, I'm off. Okay. Sweetie, are you okay? Yeah. I'm just excited. Look, I know I'm not the most expressive father in the world, but... I love you, Valentina! Who is that? Valentina! Look. I love you. I love you more than anything in the world and... If I don't try, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Please, don't get married. But... I'm sorry, Dad. Tell Mom I'm sorry! IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD You killed my father! Twelve hundred hits in one week. Half of them were me! I'll show you one we made at a skating camp... I think we've seen enough videos, Chus. Honey, please, ten seconds. I swear. If we're going to give your daughter a scholarship, we want to be sure that she'll make the most of it. Our conservatory requires a lot of discipline. Discipline is Marta's best friend. What my husband means is Marta is very responsible. She gets straight A's, always helps at home... All on her own... Dagger, no! Sugar makes him aggressive. This is Emma Muller, from the Reina Sofia Conservatory. Hi. How are you? Sup. We're going in my room to study, okay? Bye! Later. She likes to help kids in her class who are having trouble with a subject. She's a gem. You should have got her a purse. She likes stuffed animals. Hands off. She's fucking 20 years old. Nineteen! So what? You guys are clueless, you don't have kids. I'm trying to soften her up so she'll talk to me. I think she has a boyfriend, but she won't tell me. If she won't tell you, the kid must be a bum. Yeah, totally. Okay, drop it. -A delinquent. -A drug addict. -A dealer. -Or a Barcelona fan. Leave me alone. -A purse snatcher. -A pickpocket. Get away from me, damn it! -A skinhead! -Or a gypsy! What? -That's enough! -What are you doing? Life doesn't stop because a wedding goes wrong. It doesn't! Life goes on. And I'm with Alex now. And if you really care about me, you have to accept it. I'm in love with him. She's in love with him. "She's in love with him." -I'm sorry, Mom. -It's okay, darling. We'll meet him tomorrow. I'm not going. Yes, you are! And no more junk food! Tomorrow you're fasting! Lettuce! Boiled fish! Roast chicken! And take a shower! You smell like... Tell him how he smells. I smell him from here! Like a man! Well? How did you two meet? -It's a long story. -At a trial. You're a lawyer too? Sure, a supreme court judge. I was the defendant. -You can spare the details. -Please. -We want to know. -Yeah, sweetie. Please. What were you accused of? Burning a photo of the King. They want to know. He didn't do it, he was just at a protest. Protesting the monarchy. Against the monarchy. Well, those things happen. You might not know this, but the king avoided a military coup. And saved us from the dictatorship. Sure, the Transition to democracy. The '78 regime. -What year were you born? -'85. What do you know if you weren't alive? No, it's okay. I didn't live in Egypt either, and I know slavery is wrong. But your kind are probably all for it, judging by the last labour reform. Which saved Spain from the economic crisis. Your kind left Venezuela without toilet paper. -Look, Arturo... -Alex. Come on, let's eat. How's your steak, Alex? I'm not a big meat eater, but... Very tasty, yeah. Not everyone can afford it... Excuse me? No, I said, not everyone can afford it. -You know who can't afford it? -Who? Venezuelans. -Is it hot in here? -Yeah. Suddenly... Yeah, yeah. Much better. What's that A? A for Alex, sweetie. His name is Alejandro. No, Isabel. That A... Dad. If we don't do something, in two days your daughter will be playing the flute outside a shopping mall. -Take this, darling. -What is it? Something light to help you sleep. Good night. I'm going to take a bath. What did you give me last night? It took me 3 hours to get out of bed. Don't exaggerate. Relaxal, I take one every day. What? That's a tranquilizer, you need a prescription. Don't be ridiculous. My friend Camino takes them, she gave me a few. It's like a sleeping pill. You're a junkie! Isabel said Valentina's boyfriend is a bit of a hippie. A hippie wannabe. Don't you dare call him that in front of her. A total wannabe. At least the kid has ideals. Marta's is a NEET. That's much worse. No, it's worse not knowing. Sarai's could be a mix: a NEET wannabe. -You still don't know anything? -Just that he's a photographer. You know what we should do? We should sabotage it. Scare them away. Make their lives miserable until they dump them. -Honey... -What...? I'm just kidding! We would never do that! That was a good one! Amazing. Look, here's that tutorial on the Internet I mentioned. Look, they make a volcano with the charcoal and stick some newspaper underneath... You're burning my brain with that fucking cell phone! I'll stick it up your ass! I'm not kidding! Take it easy, I just wanted to show you... Hey, champ. Why the long face? You look tense. -Here, turn around. -What are you doing? -Look at that knot. -Shut up and listen. I have a proposal to make. -You mean kill them? -No, no. Scare them. Sabotage. Get rid of them. You're saying my daughter has a boyfriend? Yeah. Yes, she does. Your whole family knows except you. Damn it! Why won't anyone fucking tell me? I don't get it. Lower your voices, they'll hear you. What do you say? You guys help me with the hippie wannabe and I help you with the NEET and the photographer. -Mine's the photographer? -Yeah. But that's good. We don't know. He could be a Latin King. A Latin King photographer? Or a Latin King architect! Get the fuck out of here! Then why hasn't she told you anything? Don't listen to him, I'm sure he's a good kid. Don't touch me! No, he's not a good kid. And yours is even worse, Chus. If you don't do something, in 3 months Marta will be failing school and puffing on a... On what? Joints? Don't even joke about that stuff. What are you doing? Who's handling the barbecue? The meat is burning. It's for their own good. Do what you want, I'm going to talk to my daughter. And yours is going out with a delinquent. I can't stop her, she'd never talk to me again. If we do what I say, they don't need to find out. That way you could still be friends. You're a psychopath. We raised them right, we have to trust them. They'll be fine. Insulting a teacher is a serious offense. I'm sorry, but I can't believe Marta would do that. She called her Chewbacca in front of everyone. And she's the singing teacher. Given her good grades, if she apologizes in front of everyone, we'll forget this incident. But if it happens again, she'll be expelled. Expelled? Look, I don't want to point any fingers, but this is all Dani's fault, the boy she's seeing. What are you talking about? Dani didn't do anything. -Dad... -What? Say something! Me? What your mother means... is that... at your age... when you like someone a lot, sometimes you're not able to see what they're really like. And what's Dani like? Definitely not the teacher's pet. -I went too far. -Yes, you did. As usual. Anything you say hits them hard. Hi, princess. You look gorgeous. You guys see how pretty she is? Hi, Dad. Hold on, don't move. Please! Ernesto? Yes? Ernesto Gabatelli? -Yes. -You don't remember me? Poli, from school. This guy when he was 12 years old came to our school with his Argentinian accent and all the girls were crazy about him. "Bollocks!" -The first one to get laid. -Hipolito. Poli, Poli. -How are you? -Good, good. -What do you do? -I'm a photographer. -Great. Married? Any kids? -No. No, you know I was always allergic to commitment. Tell me about it. Me too. I got the ball and chain. You must have a lady around somewhere. Well, yeah. I'm seeing a girl. She's a bit younger. Is she hot or what? She's a bonbon. Surprise. Poli! You pervert! She's my daughter! -Poli, stop! -Get off me! Don't touch me! I didn't do anything! Your old man is a wanker! Hang in there, my boy. Be strong. Thanks, Arturo. -Dad? -Yes. Valentina, don't forget to take the Gravina contracts. I can't talk right now. Murderers! Police! Murderers! Valentina, where are you? Everything's fine. I'll call you later. Valentina, what's going on? What a disgrace! A disgrace! Dad, I'm sorry, okay? But listen to me. At the firm we defend people with a lot of money. I want to defend people with no money, normal people. I have money and I'm normal. You sound like an anarchist. Dad, please. If you want to defend normal people, there are plenty of normal clients right here. Drug addicts, prostitutes, pickpockets... Hey, I'm a delivery man. I'm here to report a crime. I stole someone's wallet. Great. Calm down, okay? Sorry about that. It's that hippie wannabe's fault, he brainwashed you. That's enough. No, he didn't... -All set? -Yeah, all set. -Okay. -Shall we? You're lucky he didn't call the police! He's the paedophile! A paedophile who likes adult women! He could be her father! Almost her grandfather! If Ernesto had a kid at age 12, and then 12 years later... -Wait, I got mixed up. -Sweetheart, really. I don't like it either, but all we can do is reason with her. How, if she won't talk to me? Because you broke her boyfriend's nose! I should have broken his legs! Then you complain that she won't tell you things. Hipolito! What did the therapist say? -Poli! -Hipolito! What did the therapist say? That we had to count to ten. Then count! -Fifteen! -No, ten! Excuse me, 15! If that schmuck had a kid at age 12, and 15 years later that kid had a daughter... Grandfather! Shut up! I can hear you. -I didn't say anything. -I can hear you think. Arturo, promise me you won't get involved. -I don't understand you. -"Otay!" Please, with words. I promise, my love. -Happy? -Yes. -I'm going to the bathroom. -Okay. I might need a pill when I get back. You've spoiled her, since she was little. Like all fathers. No, no, your thing isn't normal. I'm sick of it. You never say anything to her. I always end up being the bad one. -It's your turn this time. -I don't want her to hate me. For the 15th time, Jesus. Marta isn't your friend, she's your daughter. And that kid is a bad influence. She's already lost the scholarship. If she gets kicked out of school, it'll be your fault. Do whatever you have to, but you have to forbid him from seeing her. Dad. Yeah? I'm sorry about before. Yeah, yeah... Agent Mulder? Agent Scully. -Movie and dinner on Thursday? -Yeah. -Perfect. Good night. -Good night. CHUS HAS ADDED YOU TO THE SUPER BROTHERS-IN-LAW GROUP ARE WE STILL ON? OF COURSE! I'M IN I'M IN BUT OLGA CAN'T KNOW OR ALICIA TALK AT THE BARBECUE ON SUNDAY ROCK N' RULE!!! ROCK N' RODENT IT'S THE CORRECTOR ROCK N' RULE!!! ROCK N' ROLL, DAMN IT ARTURO HAS LEFT THE GROUP POLI HAS LEFT THE GROUP We start with the hippie. No way, the paedophile or I'm out. What? This is my house, it was my idea. Because you have a pool. Then buy a pool and we'll go to yours. You fix everything with money. Better than punching people. Okay, okay, guys. Come on, let's find... another way. Something more... Rock, paper, scissors? -What are you, 6 years old? -Rock, paper, scissors. Okay. Rock, paper, scissors. You lost. This game is fucking bullshit. In real life I'd stick the scissors up your ass and crack your head open with the rock. We'll start with yours. What's the plan? I don't know, but look. He's anti-system, but he uses social networks. Very inconsistent. Look. I'd kick his ass. No crimes, please. Go through his trash, like on CSI. -Crime. -Really? If he had a lover... -Piece of cake! -No way. You don't even know what I'm going to say. We're not hiring a prostitute, Hipolito. -I wasn't going to say that. -What, then? I won't say it now. Something's coming to me. You see? We erase the background -and retouch it. -Awesome. -There are tutorials on Internet... -We don't care. Print it and we'll send it to Valentina without a sender. We'll send it to all three and we're done. They're cousins, they talk to each other. We can't do the same thing to all three. You're right. Only one option left. We're not hiring a prostitute. Damn! You caught my fin... Can't you knock first? What are you doing in here? Come outside and get some air, enough playing with the computer. Jesus. Have you taken care of what we talked about? I'm on it, I'm on it. The next one has to be the NEET. Look, there he is. I told you. -What? -Smoking joints at 3 P.M. We'll call the police and that's that. They don't arrest you for one joint. -They don't? -No. What do you know about life in the hood? I have a law firm. -"A law firm." They're dealers. -They can't be dealers. They can't be dealers! -What did he give him? -They're dealers. Holy shit! I should tell his parents. His parents? His parents and their friends! -Then what should I do? -Kick his ass and that's that. Calm down! Let me think. That kid is a NEET. A NEET only cares about one thing. It's ringing. -This will never work... -Stop! Improvise. -For your daughter. -Yes? Hello? Who is it? I can't hear you, damn it. Daniel Crespo. -Castro. -Castro. Who is this? Look, I'm Mar...fddf's uncle. I can't hear you! Hello? I can't hear you. My nephew is in your class. Listen because I'm only going to say this once. My nephew... Damn it! My nephew is in love with your girlfriend. So I want you to dump her right now. Who are you? Are you fucking with me? My partners and I have decided that if you dump your girlfriend we'll give you 1,000 bucks. 500. You said 1,000. You're looking to get your ass kicked. 500 and we won't crack your head open. 1,000 or forget it. The jerk hung up. Stay calm, they can smell fear. Thanks a lot, I feel a lot calmer now. Are you Daniel? Peppa Pig couldn't make it? Who? Peppa Pig? Get smart with me and I'll smack you silly. -Calm down. -Fuck that! Please, let me do the talking. You have to break up with her today. Okay. What's your nephew's name? Antonio Fernandez Gil. What of it? He's not in my class. What? There's an Antonio Fernandez Ribas. That's what I said, shit for brains! Fernandez Ribas! His parents separated, you're clueless. His father's surname gets cancelled out... What do you mean? -Dagger, be quiet. -Never mind. Go on. -Beat it. -Hit the road! If you see her again, I'll stick that dog up your ass! Jerk! Fool! Well? How did it go? Nobody messes with the super brothers-in-law. Yes! Give me five. Give me five. Cut the crap, it's mine's turn. I've been investigating. And it turns out he's... an artistic photographer. Argentinian and an artistic photographer. What more do you want? He must be boning all his models. What a brute. Already a horndog at school and it gets worse with age. All we have to do is follow him and catch him with a lover. Then I'll show up and smash his head in! Slow down. -He's going to realize. -Who cares? -Speed up and run him over. -Chus. Poli. Poli my ass. Look how he says hi to all the girls, the bastard. He hasn't done anything wrong. He winks at one, then another and another... Give me a break, Chus. Don't be so clueless. I think we're being very racist here. Just because he's Argentinian doesn't mean he has tons of lovers. Maybe. Come on! And he's going to talk to them in broad daylight? I'll stick that bicycle -up his ass! -Calm down, calm down. She could be a friend, his sister, a client... Okay. -Do whatever you want. -I'll kill him. Crime. No... -We have to leave. -No, we have to warn him. No, we can't help him anymore. Why are you shaking? For God's sake, drive! Start the car, Chus! For God's sake! There. -Forget the belt, let's go! -I'm putting it on! Good afternoon. Hipolito, what's up? Son of a bitch! You're cheating on her! You're cheating on her! Dad, what the fuck are you doing? Why didn't you double park? It was a good spot! Parking is impossible downtown. Bastards! Sarai, don't go like this. Let's talk. -You know what your dad is like. -What's he like? Well? She dyes her hair blue and nobody tells me. Then shit happens! Come with me for a second. I can't talk in my own house? Shut up! I've been putting up with you losing control for two years. That's okay. Because I love you. And that's why we go to therapy together. I'm not finished. Either you make an effort to get along with her boyfriend, or I'm the one who'll stop counting to ten. And we don't want that now, do we? Dad. What's the crime for sending filth like this? Is that...? This is Alex. No. It's a Photoshop that looks like it was made by a 3-year-old. Identity fraud, harassment, invasion of privacy, slander... I don't know, Dad. What's your opinion as a lawyer? Valentina... No. Look, I know I really hurt you. But this is a very low blow, Agust?n. -What? -What? You know how humiliating it was for me to find this in my box? If you interfere in my life again like this, I'll sue you. Dad, you're a witness. Arturo, I promise I didn't... I would never do something like that. I hope not. Marta! Is something wrong, sweetheart? I noticed you've been a little down lately... and I prepared a dose of energy for you. Dani. I'm really sorry. Sit down. Dani told me that... Is something wrong? No, no... Why? I'm fine, I'm fine. His grandfather died. His grandfather died? They were very close, the boy's in a lot of pain. That's why he's been cross lately. -I think he's depressed. -Sure, that must be it. -But he's a nice kid. -Yeah, he is. Look what he bought Marta. I told him to return it. You know what this must have cost? -At least 1,000 euros. -At least. I feel so sorry for him. At least Marta's helping him a lot. You haven't talked to her yet, -have you? -Huh? No, no... I haven't had time. And it's better this way. You're a great father. Hi. Pastries. We started off on the wrong foot. I know I have a strong character, but I love Valentina and it's important that we get along. Please. Okay. Now that we're friends, the good news. Alex and I... are getting married. All of a sudden? Isn't it too soon? Remember what happened with Agust?n. I don't mean you, it's not your fault. Actually it is. We want to spend the rest of our lives together. I've never been so sure of anything. I thought you were against everything. -That includes marriage. -Okay, look. I do think it's a ridiculous and unnecessary convention, but... So you think I'm ridiculous and unnecessary. -No. -And my wife. And 90% of the world population. Anarchist. -Dad... -Listen, if I get married, it's because I love Valentina more than anything in the world. Have you picked a church? Or a date? I can talk to Father Gabriel. Yeah, call Gabi at least. We want a small wedding. A civil ceremony, just family and friends. Easy. No church wedding? Perfect. -No church wedding. -Arturo... I don't get it, explain it to me. If you're going to do it, do it right. I'm trying, really, but... What's wrong with a church wedding? If the kid doesn't believe in God, fine... Even better. If he's an atheist, what does he care? You won't burn for setting foot in a church. Even if you want to burn it down. That's enough... It's decided. What matters is they're getting married. So when they have kids... Great, that's settled. What was that look? -What look? -That look. Are you pregnant? Look... I'm having a grandson? We're going to be grandparents! Arturo Palacios Junior! I can imagine him scampering... -Arturo! -What, what, what? We're not having a baby. In fact, we're not going to have children... ever. Excuse me? We thought about it a lot and decided that... with the economic crisis, wars, lack of resources, bringing kids into the world is condemning them to poverty. Sure, we're surrounded by poverty in this house, right? That's why I worked my ass off my whole life, to let my grandchild rot like a rat. Arturo! Don't Arturo me! I've heard enough! My daughter can marry a hippie wannabe, but nobody insults my grandchildren! -You don't have any! -Because of him! Let's all just please calm down, okay? Arturo, you never know with these things. Yes, you do, Isabel. You do! I'm going to take a bath. -He showered this morning. -Let him. Of course you know. This guy's capable of getting a vasectomy. He's her boyfriend and he has to come. Come on, the barbecue has always been just for family. If you want Sarai to come home, you have to show her your support. That's just how it is. -Look at her bun. -Good lord. Promise you'll apologize, to her and Ernesto. Okay, I will. Come on, let's go. -Never worked in their lives. -They're mods, you don't get it. Wait. Thanks, I don't want any. They're both for me. I'll go and find them. -Fix your collar. -Leave it. If this is art, my balls are carnations. No... Good evening, welcome. Thank you all for coming. This exhibition is the result of months of analysing nudity and female sexuality. Like Livingstone in Africa, I have explored every single inch of the body you see in these photographs to the point that it no longer holds any secrets for me. Meet my muse: Sarai. I swear that we were working most of the time. I'm pleased to announce that we're doing a tour of South America. And also this: I want to ask you, my love, in front of all these people, to join me on this adventure. Of course, my love. Count to ten. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. It's impossible. It can't be. It was in her locker. No, it's not Marta's. No, it isn't. Someone put it there. You tell him, sweetie. -It's mine, Dad. -No... No, no, no. No way. You're protecting someone. She's protecting someone. Call the police. Have them run prints and ballistic tests to see who put joints in the lockers. They're using our daughter as a mule! Please, let's all calm down. Nobody's using anyone as a mule, nobody's dealing anything, and nobody's going to call the police. I warned you the last time. I'm sorry, but she'll be expelled for one week. One second. Marta... Marta! Look me in the eye... Look me in the eye! And tell me the truth. Okay, okay. It's Dani's. -No, wait... -It's Dani's! Don't touch me! -I had to do it. -What? If he gets caught, he'll get expelled forever. -He's a dealer, don't you see? -No. He's a dealer, dragging you down... You're going to end up in a Turkish prison knife-fighting for a piece of bread. -I wish! I wish! -What? I'd have more freedom than at home! Marta, sweetie... You wouldn't last one hour in a Turkish prison! We have to forbid her from seeing him. -Chus, relax. -I can't. Inhale and breathe, please. -I'm breathing. -Your hands. Your hands. -Sooner or later... -Yeah? ...she was bound to upset us. She's a teenager, darling. This is serious. We're talking about drugs. Okay. It starts here and ends up here and here. No, I'm serious. Don't laugh. -Please! -They stick it in here. Don't exaggerate. Who didn't smoke an occasional joint at her age? Me. Never in my life. I see that you have. Great. I just found out I married -Pablo Escobar. -Jesus. Marta sacrificed herself to give him a chance. To help him. Poor Dani is going through a hard time because -of his grandfather. -His grandfather again. His grandfather didn't die. That's the oldest excuse in the world. Now he can do whatever he wants. He's brainwashed you both. You're paranoid. I can't even talk to you. A toast to the future bride and groom. They even invited the cradle-robber. The whole time turning the meat over and over again. He burnt it to a crisp, damn it! It was great meat. That schmuck is taking my daughter to South America for 3 months with all the perverts. At least you don't have to watch him ruin her life. -We have to see it up close. -That's true. I have to put up with this thing. -Here... -No, don't give him cake. Sugar makes him aggressive. Get down, that's enough. We have to do something. These rats have moved in like a plague. They need to be exterminated. But little traps won't do the trick. You have to use poison. No more mister nice guy. It's time to get serious. It's for their own good. It's for their own good. -It's for their own good. -There it is. Super brothers-in-law! Calm down, damn it! We're losing our minds. If we're in this together, we're in this together. I feel like I'm cheating on Alicia. Look, Hipolito. We're not cheating on anyone, we're not going to do anything. Besides, this was your idea. Fuck it, I'm leaving. You guys handle it. You guys are like little kids. -Jazmin? -Yes. Come in. This is Jazmin. -Nice to meet you, Miss. -Likewise. You didn't say there were two of you. No, no... I love it, I love it. But it's a little more expensive. No, it's something else, it's not what it... looks like. We want you to seduce someone else. Then should I undress? Yeah, yeah... No, no, no. Yeah, just to... No? No. No. No. No, no. Rather than seduce... You have to meet a gentleman tomorrow and be affectionate with him. We'll be in a car taking photos from a distance. Here's the address. It's our niece's boyfriend. We want them to break up. He's her uncle, I'm his brother-in-law. I'm leaving. No, please. Anything you want. 500 euros. 500? Come on, 500 euros? Who is this? Poli. -The girl's father. -Another brother-in-law. I thought it would be cheaper, but hey... 500 bucks sounds fine to me. Yeah, Arturo's paying. What am I, a bank? I put up the 1,000 for the NEET. Look, listen to me, really. First of all, I'm totally against prostitution, okay? But this whole business we're making is because I really love my daughter, you understand? Yes. Okay. 1,000 euros. Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? You can't go like that. -Why not? -Take off your jacket. -Why? -Take it off, come on. Okay, there. Here, give it to me. Wait, wait. Much better. Okay. Hipolito, you look good. Here we go. Hi. Alex? Alex? Hello. We give away food on Tuesdays. What did you say? My bathroom is bigger than your house. Take it easy. We're looking for Alex. Is he here? Colour him! Alejandro. Stay here and keep playing. Alex. Alex. What are you doing here? Very pretty building. The graffiti, the sofas... You're renting? Look, I'm here because we didn't get to talk much at the barbecue. You didn't say a word to me. Yeah, well... Anyway, I'd like to bury the hatchet. And celebrate your engagement with a drink. Just you me and my brothers-in-law. The men of the house. Come on. -Get fired up. -Have a drink. It's just... I don't know. The wedding's tomorrow. It's a civil ceremony, there isn't even a banquet. Come on, a "Cuba libre." "Free Cuba." You must like that. Okay, just one. I promise. Just one. -Here we go. -Good evening. Bachelor party, he's getting married. Yeah, another martyr in the making. Yeah. We're dropping him off and we're leaving, okay? -Thanks. -Thank you. Come on, get in. Slowly, that's it. Come on, over there. Back there, it's okay. Kid got drunk at his bachelor party. -Over there. -Right here. I feel awful. Take this, it'll help. Arturo. You're an awesome father-in-law. Valentina is right. She's right. Give me that fucking pill. Open your mouth. Open your mouth, that's it. Swallow it, swallow it. Damn it, gross! Sleep it off. -Let's go. -Take his cell phone. Never mess with the super brothers-in-law. ...destination Bucharest. Only the NEET left, he's a piece of cake. We buy drugs, put them in his locker -and he'll get expelled. -Where do we buy? I'll call a friend who definitely knows. He's a councilman. Yeah, my dad told me you were coming. What do you feel like? Cocaine. What? -Give us a second. -Yeah. We want him to get expelled, not go to jail for two years. -You're right. -We'll buy marijuana. -Cocaine's more illegal. -Almost a crime. Let's get cocaine. -A lot of it. -No... Cocaine. We want cocaine. Half a kilo of cocaine. You've never bought drugs, -have you? -Yeah. Nobody has half a kilo of cocaine in their house. Half a kilo would cost 30,000 euros. 30,000 bucks? That's what I make in a year. How expensive. What about orange juice? Three euros for a tiny glass. Now that's a business, not cocaine. Right? Let me. Give us ten grams. No, trust me. Ten grams. -That's nothing. -It's enough. Are we sure it's not adulterated? It doesn't matter? We're not going to touch it. -It matters to me. -Who cares? I care. I don't trust this guy. -Period. -Hipolito... What's up? -Is this crap good or what? -Of course. Of course. I want to try it. Okay. Sissy stuff. What's he doing? -Well? Do you feel anything? -What...? What should it taste like? Ten grams. This isn't enough, we need more. -There's plenty. -Yeah? If Marta got expelled for a joint, imagine what the NEET will get for this. You keep it, it gives me the creeps. "I an't eel my ongue." My tongue is "asweep." I'm so nervous! Did you want something, sweetie? Yes. -Mom, give us a second. -Let her talk to her father. You look gorgeous. -You look handsome too. -Thanks, nieces. Dad. Thank you. Thank you for accepting Alex. I love you. Okay. Today will be unforgettable, you'll see. Sure it will, darling. I love you both so much! Let's go, we have to hurry. No! Vale... Valentina, please. Wait a second, calm down. I don't understand. I don't get it. It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay. There must be an explanation. What time did you leave him? I don't know, early. He wanted to stay and we lost track of him. Jesus, tell me you guys had nothing to do with this. What? No way! -Hipolito. -Poli. -Hipolito. -Don't be paranoid. Don't insult us. Sweetheart... It was karma. For standing up Agust?n. And now the same thing is happening to me. It wasn't your fault. Yes, it is. I'm too fussy and I'm a bad person. You're not a bad person. What's my daughter doing with the bouquet? If there's no wedding, the bouquet doesn't count, right? Play it off, she's watching. Look over there. Wow, yeah. Dad... They were shooting up something. Everything is under control. I'm okay. What are we doing here? Come on, let's go. No! We have to leave the drugs in his locker. -No. -He's right, it's his turn. Didn't you see Valentina's face yesterday? How do you think Marta will feel when her boyfriend gets sent to a reformatory? She'll thank me someday. It's for her own good! -That's right. -Poli, listen to me. Do you want to see Sarai crying because Ernesto cheated on her? He shouldn't have. He didn't, you're the one cheating on her! With this bullshit! What? No, no, no. Don't listen to him. Since he's solved his problem... Now he's honourable. Really. I've never felt less honourable in my whole life. -You can't smoke in here. -I'll smoke wherever I want! Fine. I screwed up, but you're still in time. -Chus. -What? Just be assertive with the NEET. Talk to Marta without fear. And you. Poli, Sarai's an adult. She can do whatever she wants. -Cancel the hooker. -Good. No, no, no. No. No. We can't listen to this guy. He's a manipulator. -He's a manipulator. -And you're a coward. And a pain in the ass. Nobody likes you. And your videos are fucking crap. Give me the drugs. Here you go. No, I won't give it to you. -Give it to me. -No. No. -Give it to me. -No. That's enough! -There! -Good. Smoking in the bathroom, huh? I smell smoke! Very nice, very nice! You're in big trouble! Come on out! I'll tell your parents! Let's go. Afternoon. What time's the PTA meeting? Chus, count to ten, man. -Say something. -I don't want to. He's acting like a child. He called me a manipulator. I try to be your friend, you always blow me off. I'm Bozo the brother-in-law. -Jesus, please. -Forget it, I don't need you. Count to ten, it works! Leave me alone, damn it. You. -What? -Who do you think you are? What are you saying? This is my house. Get that fucking mutt off the sofa and get out. I never want to see you with my daughter again. Otherwise you're in for a good reprimand. -Are you going to hit me? -Yes. Go ahead. This is all your fault! If you'd left when I gave you the chance, none of this would have happened. What chance? I gave you 1,000 euros to leave, damn it! -Damn, you're Pocoyo? -Poco what? You're crazy! That's right. So take this mutt... Dad! What are you doing? You threaten him, blackmail him and hit him? I don't recognize you. Yes? Hi! Look, my motorcycle just broke down. Can you come down -and help me? -What? Abort! Abort... Hipolito? Ernesto. I'll take care of this. What a disgrace. The motorcycle trick to put advertising in mailboxes. Cancel the plan. Keep the money. -Thanks! Bye, handsome. -Bye. What a disgrace. I should call the police for bothering you at this hour. Sorry about that, Ernesto. How about a cup of coffee and a chat? So I missed the... Cut the crap and tell me you'll be good to my daughter. Yes, of course I will. What about in five years? And in ten years and when she's 36? You'll be... 61. 61, right? You'll take care of her when you're 61? Yes, of course I will. It's all wonderful now, the filthy photos... But when you're 61, the war starts. Listen. Arthritis, rheumatism, your prostate, priapism or the opposite, when you can't get it up... And lots of other stuff. So you'll take care of her when you're 61? She can take care of herself... Swear on your life you'll never leave her side. -If she wants... -What? If she wants. No. Swear that you will never leave her for the rest of your life. Poli, it's hard to say... Forever! I promise. Welcome to the family. Yes? I'm Jesus, Marta's father. Who is it? I have something very important to tell you. Ali! Alicia! What? Why are you whispering? -Is she home? -Yes. Listen. You wanted to be proud of me, right? -Of course. -Give me a kiss and I'll tell you. What is it? I fixed everything with Ernesto forever. I don't care! I never want to see you again! Fuck you! What happened? -Ernesto dumped me! -What? Don't play dumb, it's your fault! What did you do? We had coffee and I gave him the family hug. Now he dumped me. -You went to his house? -Yeah. He said he's too old for me, something about his prostate and he's going to South America alone. Dad, please, stay out of my life! I'm sick of you treating me like a child! I'm a woman, don't you get it? How could you? You never understand anything. Sweetheart... My baby... Look, Ali, I'll fix this. This guy is a fucking idiot! I give him the family hug and what does he do? I'm going back over there to look him in the eye man to man and see what happens. You're not going to talk to anyone else. -But... -What did I say? To stay out of her life, damn it! Is that...? It was in his backpack. I won't call the police, but... You have to promise me that Dani will stay away from my daughter. I don't understand. I really don't. I told you we needed to take him to a psychologist. He was climbing out of the hole... Hole? Was he in a hole? His grandfather died recently and he was very depressed. They were very close. Yeah... My wife told me about his grandfather. Dani was a sweet boy. He got good grades, he helped at home... He was affectionate. Then he started skipping school... and smoking joints and now... this shit. We thought your daughter was helping him, but no. Hi! Don't bite. Dad? Dani. What does this mean? What does this mean? What is it? That's not mine, I swear! Don't play dumb with me! It's flour! It's flour! It's flour! Flour! Why would he have flour in his backpack? It's my... flour. But... why? Because he wants me to dump Marta. He's fucking nuts! Dani, take it easy. You're defending him? -It's not that... -You know what? I can't take it anymore. Get out. Both of you! I'll come back... and we'll clear up this misunderstanding. Joaquin, please! Hey, thanks for letting us come here. Yeah, thanks. That's what family is for. Don't worry, guys. Everything will work out. What were you thinking? Come on, let's go. Hold on. I need your help with Isabel and Valentina. How? Just keep quiet. Nothing more. Hello! Tell me you didn't! -Tell me you didn't! -Okay, okay. You got me drunk, drugged me and put me on a bus. This is unbelievable! Only someone like you could do something so disgusting. I was going to tell you everything. Then it's true? You both knew! Alex, I'm sorry. -Forgive me, I was unfair... -Okay, stop. This is too much. Don't touch me. Alex! -Sweetie... -No, listen to me. I hate you. Isabel... Isabel! Call an ambulance! Hi. Your husband had a minor heart attack. -What? -Good lord. We should keep him under observation for at least 48 hours. His cholesterol looks like someone who only eats bacon. Yeah, he eats badly. Luckily it was only a scare. You can go home and rest now. -Thank you, doctor. -You're welcome. -Have a good day. -Thank you. Hipolito. Come on, let's go. Let's get out of here. Leaving already? No, you two are staying. Fuck this. -What are you doing? -I'm getting my daughter back. And you two should do the same! Marta, sweetie. I wanted to buy you a shake and... And say I'm sorry. I understand, I wouldn't want a father like me either. If I'd had a father like me, and he did things like this, I'd have run away. Darling, come with me. Look at me. -What's going on? -It's urgent! -Is Mom okay? -I'll tell you on the way. Dani! Excuse me. I need some help. Can you tell me where Alex is? Please. -Please, listen to me! -It's that wacko. Her father. I already dumped her! Leave me alone! Listen. Marta ran away from home and we don't know where she is. Hold on, stop. Say something, you're scaring me. Mom's fine. Here. You're going with him on the trip. That's our savings. Dad, please... Go on, call him. They will not pass! They will not pass! More poetry and less police! More poetry and less police! We're almost there, there he is. There he is, Dad. Faster! Drive! We need to go, drive! Ernesto, stop, please! Stop! Drive faster, he's crazy! I can't speed! My life is in danger, you wanker! Stop! Stop, you dickhead! I come in peace! Stop! My love! Damn it... Roast the pigs! Roast the pigs! Roast the pigs! Alejandro! Arturo, what are you doing here? Arturo, what are you doing here? -Open the door! -I'm calling the police! Open the door! I come in peace! I didn't know how to say this so I wrote it down. Look, you see? Marta! Darling... Are you okay? Have you eaten? Things might not work out between you and my daughter. In ten years you might not be able to keep up with her and you have to leave her. Or she might leave you because you can't get it up. We need to talk. I'm sorry for my behaviour. -Arturo, this isn't the time. -No, no, no! Leave me alone! Look, Alex. Let's work out our differences like civilized people. Don't you ever talk to me like that again. What you did is very irresponsible. You scared your mother to death. You're a woman now, right? Go on, talk to him. I'll be in the car. That said... I'm sorry. I hope someday you can forgive me, because... this was all my fault. What are you doing? Touch him again and I'll... Listen. I did something you're going to like. -Why do you come to this park? -Dad... -Do you use condoms? -Dad, please... Alex. I'm sorry. Okay. I think we're even. What happened? My baby... Dad? I got beat up by the riot police. What? They came after me and he stepped in front. Really? Look, I... What? I wanted to say I'm sorry... I'll get you out of here. Well, Arturo. Now that you've been in my shoes, I guess we can be friends. Excuse me? -The beating was for you. -Very nice. Very nice, and you deserved it. But... The monarchy is an essential part of this country's history. If you deny that, you're ignorant. Careful with your back. The monarchy is just an excuse to waste money. Why do we say "to live like a king"? Fine, we'll do like your beloved Venezuela. What's Venezuela got to do with it? It has everything to do with it! Everything! This is impossible, I can't even talk to you. Go ahead, we'll all end up wearing loincloths. Valentina, please, hurry up! Today is the happiest day of my life. I've done a lot of thinking and I've arrived at the conclusion that we have absolutely nothing in common, Alex. Except one thing. What matters most. Valentina. -I love you, sweetheart. -Me too. IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD Come on, everybody! Let's take a selfie! One, two, three!
