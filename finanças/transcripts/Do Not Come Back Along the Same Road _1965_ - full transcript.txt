- Everyone out! - Music! Come on, play the music! Get him! Get him! Starring - Be careful. - Police, police! After him! Go around. Tomcat, watch out! After him! Don't let him get away! There he is! Boys, get over here! After him! in DON'T COME BACK BY THE SAME WAY Also starring Screenplay Direction Tomcat. Tomcat! It's dangerous here. They're already working downstairs. Is he dead? Dead? I don't know. What about Lenka? She left you. Left? She's not right for me. They're a different sort of people, as are we. I know. Listen to me, Tomcat. Maybe you'll make it. Go home. - Home. - Yes, home. Don't just give yourself up. Ibro, I'm afraid. I must go. They won't take me later. Comrades, listen to me. Let's make something clear. Those that are able will be skilled workers in no time. We already have people from your region working for us. The pay is good. The best possible. You, for instance, are strong. You could pull the tail off a horse. - What do you say? - We must work, no matter where. - How old are you? - I'll be 18. - In good health? - Come on, hurry. Step closer. Pops! Pops! Pops! Pops, they're here. Hurry. First, he asks about your age. I wonder whether he'll take me. - Age? - 25. - What about your health? - I caught a little cold the other day. Really? Have you worked in construction before? Here, everybody is a bit of a builder. There it is. Here you are. Next. Closer. Come closer. Any more takers? Next. - Let's go. - You too, old man? Got any experience? I've been migrating for work for 10 short years. That's different. I also fought in the war. From 1942 until the end. - How old are you, comrade? - Well, about 50. - You got an identity card? - Yes. Just a second. Here. This is a Socialist Alliance membership card. I need the identity card. Okay. Identity card... Here it is. So you really are 50 years old. Many try to trick us. - They hide their age like women. - Yes, indeed. Nothing came yesterday. No letter or money. I haven't got a letter for a month, either. How could Ahmet write to you? He's illiterate. He'd need a scribe. The preacher wrote my letter. It's in the package. He'll write to you when I get there. He doesn't even send money, my Alija. That's rich. You're tidying him up for other girls. Will Ibro take you with him to see the world? I only wanted to help. Anger makes you even prettier. You couldn't help yourself, could you? - Ibro, don't. Nothing happened. - But it did. Ajša, go home. Ibro! What is it? What? - Ibro, let him be. - Enough of that. I said stop. Ibro, leave him alone. No point. Come here. - What is it? - Return the application. - Why? - We don't want the likes of you. - What do you mean? - You live in the Middle Ages. - In Slovenia, you take women by force. - Stop it. I need that job, people. What did I do to you? This is my girl. How can we marry if you don't take me? Will you support me? Better think before you raise your hand against someone. Let's go. Ibro, I'm afraid. Mother is right. She knows. Grandpa didn't return either. Come on. Grandpa went to America. What will you think up next? I do feel that Mother is right. And my Pops... That was before the war. It's different. It's true... that some money would be welcome to buy another field. There's no other way. I must go. Before a man travels a bit and completes military service, he's no good. I can't help being afraid. You're too impulsive. Just now, you attacked the driver. - People are talking. - Never mind that. The summer's short. I'll return when it's over. - Then we'll get married. - Ibro, don't. First you cry that I won't return, now you're unwilling. Promise me something. Before you act rashly, think of me. Of course I promise. You'll be the only thing on my mind. Ibro, don't. Ibro! Watch out! Well, people, wonders never cease. You rose to new heights. - Splendid, splendid! - How are you doing, cousin? - You're new, aren't you? - Yes. - Who are you looking for? - Ahmet. He won't come for a while. - He had a big night out. - He wrote to me. Like hell. That was me. - So you're that Alija of his? - Yes. - I know everything, as you see. - That's splendid. You be quiet. - There's trouble again. - Are we cattle or slaves? Let's unionize. What can we do? The prices keep going up. - The firm can't cover the remainder. - The old shacks are good enough. - New ones weren't our idea. - Is this the deal we made? Enough of that. There's Mister. Mister, come here. Look how they're treating us. Will we work just for new shacks? - What's all this? - Kiril, if you pay five grand, you'll live in a condo. In color. I'm not spending a single penny. This way. - Here we are. - Hello. - Still no Ahmet? - Better wait for Mister. - Who's that Mister, anyway? - You'll soon see. - Silence. - Don't be so loud, people. Silence. The lad is hard at work. When is Ahmet coming? Ahmet. Ahmet. - No. Give me a few minutes more. - It's past eleven. When will you go home? The thirst is killing me. For Pete's sake, there must be a sip left somewhere. You didn't leave me a single drop. I'll be going, then. - Poor man. - Why? He comes to visit, talks about his hometown, gets wasted and then sometimes... - Alija moved in with those three. - You don't say? Those three? - We're very tired, bro. - Who asked you? Wake them up, immediately. They need a lesson. You better not touch that one. On your feet. I want to see you. Come on. Let them sleep. What Mister says, goes, even about snoring. Is that clear? What's with you? - Did you have one too many? - Well... You're drunk, Ahmet. Well, I drank and then I pissed. We brought a parcel for you. What are you saying? A parcel? There's also a letter from Bahrija. - Listen to me, my Alija. - Yes, yes. Stupid Ahmet got his first pay. He thought to himself: All that money. I can... I can buy whatever I want. - And you keep Bahrija waiting. - I sent her some. Why send her money? I won't go back. I found someone else. Just so you know. Mister's words are right. What's waiting for you at home? Just a hoe. You'll die toting it, he says. There's no life for us there. A man should see the world. He should do well for himself. Take care. Come on, come on. Lift it up. Lift it! Come on! Be careful. Stand back. They're fresh from the village. It shows they're inexperienced. We should make this Tomcat the foreman, instead of Mister. People! The shacks are being torn down! - We should make them all foremen. - That's rich. What about resources? Stop! Hold it! - What's up? - The shacks are being torn down. - Stop. - What is it? - They're tearing down our shacks. -What? - Are you drunk? - Not at all. Are we going to continue? Get a move on. Stop! - Stop! - Hold it! Stop, man! - Help me. - Take it all back. Back! - Move the things back. - Are you crazy? We're just carrying out an order. - What is he saying? - Listen, Kiril. - What's going on? - You see. - New shacks were not our idea. - Krste, what is he saying? - That he's not to blame. - Of course. The baker is to blame, his croissants are crooked. - What does the foreman say? - Five heads more or less, I don't care. Not everybody has your luck at cards. You know what the health inspector said. Kiril, you spoke to him. Did it help? We're not building new shacks for fun. Empty them. What are you waiting for? Put your things on the lorry. Come on, Mister. Attach the cable and start with the last one. - Tomcat is here! - Tomcat is here. Tomcat... Tomcat, take it easy. My advice is: don't get involved. - How could I not? I live here, too. - Ready? Ready. - Hurry up! - Everyone out! Quickly! - Careful. - Drive on. - Tomcat, stand back. - Drive if you dare. What are you waiting for, people? Everybody back to the shacks. - To the shacks! - Let's go. Kiril, take the things back. I should have left you in Bosnia. There's still time. So? Stop working. People, Ahmet is not giving up our shacks. - Who wants to go to the game tomorrow? - Me! Go, Reds! Go, Reds! Bravo! Look at her. Who are you cheering for, anyway? - Come on. - Let her be. She's gone crazy. Bravo! Splendid! You won. - Come on. - Play or get lost. You're so annoying. - Want to continue? - If you can keep up. You're full of air, mate. All in. - Let go. - He's crazy. - Look, Mister is cheating at cards. - Nonsense. - You're not getting the money. - Watch the bank. - Hands off him. - Watch the money closely. - Police! - Let go of him. Mister. Because he insulted me. I, Ibrahim Fahrić, nicknamed Tomcat, since I have always been as agile as a cat... working in construction as a migrant, since I wish to get married, but there is nothing at home for me or for my bride, do declare that I beat up migrant worker Mister, whose first and last name I don't know, because he insulted me. Insulted. Insulted. You still insist it was nothing serious? - As I said, he insulted me. - How? There are many kinds of insults. Did he curse your family or what? Who? Your mother? I'll write that down, then you'll sign it. - Are you alright? - Yes. I should have warned you about Mister. - He always uses the same trick. - And the money? - Who took it? - That's no secret. Thank you. Did he say anything? You've been dancing with him all evening. I'll have a Cockta. - The other night, I saw Red with Olga. - I don't care. Excuse me, is this seat taken? I see we're a bit uppish tonight. - You're supposed to be crazy about him. - Shall we drink? Waiter! I like dancing so we danced. Don't say that Red isn't a good dancer. - Better than this one. - Shall we? Better watch your step, girl. I'm a factory worker. I work in assembly. Do you work in a factory, too? Come on, boys. Let's go. - Still not a peep? - We talked the whole time. You fell for him, I'm telling you. I should have turned tail about the shacks. I know that I'm difficult, bro. Sometimes, I even scare myself. But a man should not take crap in order to keep a job. Help! What's up with her? Women are crazy. Help! He keeps staring at you. Who is he? - Why don't we step outside? - Outside? Yes. Is that so strange? Not bad. - A migrant will make her forget Red. - A migrant? - Are you crazy? - What else? I can smell them a mile away. Are you sure? You don't know who I am or what I do. Not even my name. You're from down south. A Serb or a Croat. Does it matter? - But why did you want to... - To step outside? Because. Because I like you. Get it? I must tell you something. I didn't know how to start. But I must tell you. - I work in construction. - Just admit you're a migrant. - What do you mean? - Let him be. Explain. When did you take off your peasant sandals, bro? Hands off. Why are you interfering? Don't you see there's nothing between us? You're cross to no avail, Pops. Some overtime would be nice. I could buy a bike. A bike? If I hadn't caught him sneaking around, your cousin would earn it himself. - Girls are different here, no? - She asked you to come? She only said her family was building a house. The old man mustn't know I'm here because of her. - Silence. - It's probably migrants. Don't hire them. We have three paychecks at our disposal, but I can't do my job with calluses. Wait. Don't be shy. Come. Well, if the girl loves you... Are you looking for work? - We're just passing. - We don't need all four. Well, let's see. The foundation needs digging. We'll pay by the hour. Better by the piece. It's all the same to me. Well, we can hire two. You and you. - How come? We're a group. - All four can work, - but we can only pay two. - Come on. Let's go. Let the kid be. I can earn enough for all. They'll only hire two. So we're not your people anymore? Let's go. - I would like to stay awhile. - Forget it. Good dog. Take that pick. Start digging there. - Will we waste money? - If I work here, I have problems reaching my quota at the plant. What do you prefer? Want some, kid? Missed me! One, two, three, safe! - A fish! - Fish! Do you want to try? Hold it like this. Yes, like this. - I'll tell mom you keep coming here! - Squealer. - Why did you slap him? - Who asked you? Let him be. - Drop the knife. Give it here. - He asked for it. Let him be, Milorad. You hear? Give me the knife. My Ahmet, this is all we know. How to drink and moan. - Let the others save money. - Let them. They're building houses and buying radios. TV sets. The Turk is quite likeable. What was his name again? Despite the rumors, they aren't all alike. I almost hit someone when I took an empty seat on the bus. The guy next to me stood up straight away, but not to get off. No, he found me too smelly. I'm thirsty. Lenka! The bottle is over there. - Your mum doesn't like me much. - You shouldn't have come. Lenka! - Patience. When we're all alone... - Lenka! Get back this minute. - Go home, at once. - Why? - Fortunately, I'm here. Are you blind? - Stop it. Admit you've met him before. - You would prefer Red for me. - Shut it. - Don't... - What? - Wait. - We should let them go. What were you thinking, falling in love with such a bloke? - There are plenty other boys. - So I'm not human? Marija. Don't speak. They were suspicious from the start. What, what? What are you doing? You heard her. - Now you can work by yourselves. - Tomcat. Abdul. Run quickly if you want to catch up to your friend. Marija, wait. We'll discuss it at home. Want to help me, Scriptures? Don't bother me. I'm studying for an exam. Why is this all tangled up? How can you ride this banger? You fix it daily, but it keeps on creaking. How was the work? - They drove us out. - Only you. I left of my own free will. Lend me ten thousand. I want to buy a rain jacket. Yesterday I saw the girl from the game again. - That's her, isn't she? - Yes. Give me five more. Come on. She is truly splendid. - Don't annoy me. - Abdul. - Don't be angry with me. - Who's angry? - Where are you going? - To buy a rain jacket. Even if you buy ten of them, they still won't like you. The only thing they understand is force. The only way is to do like Krste. Take a course and work hard. Pops won't understand, but I must move forward. When Abdul pays me back, I will buy a new bicycle. No matter what Pops says. So, my wish is to settle down again. But they're driving me crazy, all of them. They would bleed me dry if they could. It's good that I have a girl waiting for me at home. If not for her, who knows what would happen? The boss is right. Tomcat only cares about money. If I take him on, maybe he'll stop messing about. Who knows? He's a true tomcat. Money order - Come on, come on. - Slowly. What's wrong with you? Abdul is young. The lad has fallen in love. He's taken a wrong turn. Have you seen the stuff he bought? The watch and that rain thing. Rain... Rain jacket. - And a mirror. - You think too much, bro. We should go someplace. You won't be sorry. Leave me be. What's good for you is not necessarily good for me. You'll come around sooner or later. Not a chance. How will my good mother cross the river? The river... Are there no bridges? There are. But look what I'm carrying. - Money, money. Listen, Ahmet. - What is it? I have a wee problem. I collect payslips. On Monday, you took out three hundred. Wait. One, two, three. On Saturday, two hundred and a half. One, two... Two and a half. Two and a half. Last Monday... It's a wonder you don't sleep with the money. If only I could sleep. Why can't you? Sleep peacefully. Last Monday you took 175 dinars for soap. In total... I will pay you back. I'm telling you. Sure you will. - Don't worry. - I'm not worried. Oh dear mother, this is the Vardar river. It's all muddy and bloody. Well done, Krste. Well done. - I passed the exam, Kiril. - No more reading those scriptures. No more. Finished. I'll stop fixing it up. Right, Scriptures? Stop with that name. - Did you pass? - I did. Thanks. You're the man. Tonight, the drinks are on me. We'll meet at the pub. Silly. It all seems like a dream to me. Sometimes, I wonder myself. Would I be here if I didn't care about you? They say bad things about migrants. It's not easy for a girl. Tag, you're it! Just look at him. Really. Who is it? Come in. - I don't want to disturb you... - Ahmet? That Ahmet is truly nuts. Oh, well. He wasn't like that before. Some people like to keep me waiting. I wonder what you are like. I don't know what devil possessed him. I will talk to him. If it's me you want, you came in vain. - Stop it. - Wait. There's something I want to discuss with you, Ahmet. Go ahead. Shame on you. Shame. Krste invited us, but you... - My Alija... - Okay, Ahmet, okay. Do what you will. There'll come a time when you'll remember my words. I hope it won't be too late. You should also know this. We have no cause to complain about them. What were you thinking, sending this geezer to me? Silence! It will end badly for Abdul. Life is life, Alija. - Abdul is young. - He's besotted. When he becomes a skilled worker, he'll be rid of the pick. Is there a proper girl for Abdul here, Krste? Tine! - Isn't this right up your alley? - Yes. Let's be short. You can see why. I spoke to the boss. There is no shortage of students. You promised to help him. It's difficult. What about military service? You are yet to complete it. - You promised. - Don't. You heard him. He can take an evening course. I did what I could. Have you considered his lack of skills? That's true. Sometimes everything seems so simple. Lenka. I should go, but I must tell you something. People who want money should not be choosy. You could get some overtime at our house. I didn't ask you. - You called me. - I don't have time. We'll see later. Come. You do understand, don't you? My brother is right. But you must find a path. That's what I want. To find my own path. Tine. Abdul. Abdul! Stop! Stop there! What's happening, Kiril? It already happened. The brass came. I ran away. Who came? Tomcat, did your mother not teach you to listen? People from the firm. About new shacks. Where are the others? I'm sorry for Krste in the pub. - Come with me. - Don't come closer. I'll wait for you. Go into the shack. You can't stay here. There's no getting in. All the doors are locked. Oh, dear mother. Didn't I tell you? I'll talk to the chairman. Sit down. Tomcat, I understand you completely, but you cannot keep living like that. - It's not possible. - I came to take money home, not to spend it on accommodation. Yes, but the pay is not bad, is it? - You have to admit that. - Hello. We can't just give you new shacks for free. The way you were living is not healthy or fit for a man. If we all lived in shacks, it would be alright... - but this smacks of thievery. - Come, come. We happened to have some free lorries. You were told you'd need to move into new shacks sooner or later. Have some understanding. If you have no understanding for progress, in time, we won't be able to help you. Let's be honest. Nobody likes a mess. You want money, we want your labor. Let's stick to the contract. All those calculations and numbers are pointless. See? Even he understands where the rub is. Surely not where you think. All they care about is saving money. They could have several grand more and we wouldn't have to deal with shacks in high season when we are exposed to the competition. The competition. We must take a comprehensive approach to the migrant issue. I'm an expert. My analysis is strictly technical. You want to keep both sides happy, but it can't be done. I was to make our firm competitive, so I offered you a choice. Migrants, piecework, no bachelor apartments and bedsits, or the machines. If we consider the cost of conveyor belts... Some things can't be expressed in numbers. It's not all about the numbers. I use them to solve economic problems, but I can't stand a mess. Everything except the economy is metaphysics. I read all sorts of magazines. All sorts. Talk to them? Listen to me. - Nothing can come of it. - Stop it. Why sit, then? This affects us all. Let's take a stand! - Abdul. - There's Tomcat. What are you staring at? I have nothing to tell you. I saw the chairman to no avail. - I told you. - Kiril was right. How are you, man? Kiril had a good point. But the chairman is right, too. All of us are right. Still, there's something fishy. What kind of music is this? We're here to dance! Come on, boys! Come on. Music! Play the music! Enough of that. Come on, come on. Faster! Quiet! Enough of this moaning! I think Red is looking for trouble. - Me too. - With a candle. You're even chasing him? A true trollop! You'll pay for this! Tell that to your gipsy! Abdul, don't! Get him, Abdul! Play the music! We don't want to listen to these Byzantines! Who are you calling Byzantines, asshole? Put the knife away! - You won't settle this with a knife. - Who are you? - A worker, same as you. - I'm not a worker. - I'm nothing, a migrant. - A savage! - Music, music! - Have you gone crazy? Break it up! People! - Watch your face. - Play the music! Abdul! Abdul! Don't be afraid. Tomcat, watch out! So? Is he alive? There's nothing in the papers, they are against us. What am I to do? Whatever will be, will be, dead or alive. - I want to tell the truth. - Don't be crazy. There's still time. Go home to your people. I want to know who is in the right. Do you understand? If I keep hiding, I'm a criminal who needs to be found. And now I should pay five grand for a bed? I swear to you, I'm not paying. I'd rather sleep rough. Five grand? No way, no way. - Nothing to be done, Kiril. - I know. Money is the Devil's work. Money. If we shat money, life would be good. You've got it made. You'll get a degree, become an engineer. Then you'll be a true boss. A company car, a bride next to you. What about me? Mother, have mercy! Why are migrants regarded as a necessary evil? - Their low income... - Read this. The perpetrators of such criminal offenses are typically migrant seasonal workers, originating from other Yugoslav republics. The causes of such criminal offenses are usually alcohol, petty feuds, or qua... quarrels after gambling. - Where is he? - You shouldn't have come. - Now they might think he's here. - He must go home, Alija. Home? Here, everything is damned. Nobody returns. How could Tomcat return home after everything? Don't waste your time. I'll take you to the railway station. Tomcat has good taste. He watches every dinar. Alija, he's a good man. Just listen to us. Listen. Take me to him straight away. - Splendid. - Shut up. Have you thought this through, Abdul? I want to see him. I must. Tomcat paid the highest price of us all. Come on, Abdul. People. We are all in deep shit. Go on, tell her. What will become of us if we don't help each other? We'll go when it gets dark. Ibro. A woe on our land and our homes. Be silent. When two people are in love, possessions don't matter. Quiet. - You must go home, Ajša. - First, I'll help you. I'll talk to them. You'll see, I will go to them. First, I'll ask where you are. When they say they don't know, I will... Know what you'll do? Go home as soon as possible. They'll believe you left. My crazy girl. I'm awake anyway. There's work tomorrow. You can't sleep either, Ahmet? I feel guilty for not being in the pub that evening. I keep thinking... that Kiril is right. - What are you doing here? - What about you? Watch yourself. Take this, idiot. - Yes, that's right. - I should have known. Tomcat, Ajša! Police! - Police! Ibro, run! - Maybe we'll make it. - Ibro, run. - Abdul, help me. Ibro, snap out of it. Whatever will be, will be. We must accept our fate. It was self-defense. You were only defending yourself. You hear? Abdul, tell him. I didn't mean to kill him. I didn't know what I was doing. - My fear got the better of me. - Tomcat. I must tell them that. Fear. No. No! Ibro! - I will tell them. - Stop, Ajša. He is giving himself up voluntarily. Do you understand? There he is. He is giving himself up. What will you do to him? What? You don't know. You see? You don't know. Razplet, translations4media
