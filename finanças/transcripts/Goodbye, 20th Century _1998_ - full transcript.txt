And I thought that she loves me... that she loves me passionately ... like a real woman! And it seemed so natural to take my clothes off in front of someone who was looking at me so passionately. so I did... A few days later, the children started dying... The priest said that there were tears on the fresco... He said the saint'd taken her revenge, because of something! So I admitted it! I confessed... I felt sorry... for those poor kids... And they shot me! My ownpeople! And if you were to die... Is there anyone who would cry for you? There is... All right then Let me tell ya now, about th' man who plays on a gun... he's the keeper of the Glass City! Underneath the city. there's a wall where the fate of all mankind is written.

Like your mother's name - Ikonija! Citizens! The Great Empreror Alexander Wildenbrat was right when he build separate ghettos for children and their mothers which they weren't allowed to leave! They send the pregnant women there too, so they wouldn't disturb the peaceful citizens by their awfull appearance. He knew that the children, in fact, were cruel old man! Loving chldren, citizens, is like loving shit! The Great Empreror Alexandar Wildenbrat would throw up whenever he saw a child! The smell of a child. that's one of the most disgusting smells, citizens! Damyan.. Marco, Strezzo... Gorazd... Altana, Theodora, Ikonija... Kostadin, Kliment... Oh, holy mother... You know, I've got to do... So it is written to me... In the name of the Father and Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen! Let her go... That's his sister! Macedonia. The Balkans. 100 years before. Macedonia at the beginning of the 20th century. We're watching a film shot between the two Balkan Wars. Let's see what the film tape is trying to tell us after many years. This young man is called Dimitri. The armed man are his brothers. The fat gentleman is his father. The girl wearing the white dress is his sister. Dimitri has fallen in love with his sister and decided to marry her. We've just seed him buying her from their father. The priest is now blessing the young couple. The Orthodox religion doesn't bless incestuous marriages, but T it seems that this time love is stronger than tradition!

Dimitri's brothers have lost their patience! He is taking off his wedding clothes. What are they going to do? They have shot him! They have simply shot him. We just witnessed the first sin and first punishment caught on the camera in this century! The young pries mourns the dead His family pay their final respects.

Did you watch what they said on television? No. What was it they said? They said that the 21th century would uncover the false mask of morality. People would be set free of their inhibitions and walk around the streets completely naked!!! - What, everyone? Male and female! Even my mamma would walk around naked? Even your mamma. even my mamma... Even santa Claus! What about in winter? Oh, really, people, I've been talkin'about summer all along!

I can't believe it... I just can't believe it... not to have the least bit of respect for a dead man? So, where did you learn to behave like that? Let's shit on his head now! I know you didn't like my brother. I know you hardly desired to see him dead. but now at least show some respect for his death! Death has meaning only if some one cries for the dead man! That's it, folks! A time that nobody cries for isn't time at all! And I've had enough of you! One more word out of you and I'll smash your face in! The 21th century... That's cool! Hallelujahh!

I can't think anything to wish for! Anyway - if we don't see each other again... Happy New Year! I told you it's up to me! I've gotta go now. You'll stay here to make a ship! Built it of wood, with three floors! Inside and outside cover it with pitch! On the top make a hole, for light to come in... And learn to swim, brother! The future is as screwed up as the past! Well. that's all! Good-bye, 20th century!
