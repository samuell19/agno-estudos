Stories...stories...stories... Not in hundreds or thousands.... But in millions. Anyone who walks this earth is a story. I have a story too. I wanted to be a writer. But I’d never imagined that my life itself would become a story. ♫Why am I this way? ♫ ♫I had many plans for us. ♫ ♫Is this how I am to spend my life? ♫ ♫ I am with you♫ ♫And yet, I am not completely there. ♫ ♫By and by♫ ♫I am drifting apart from you. ♫ ♫ I am with you♫ ♫And yet, I am not completely there. ♫ Gautham, I am leaving. ♫By and by♫ ♫I am drifting apart from you. ♫ Are you done with your work? What do you expect, Gautham? It’s 9 o’ clock in the night. Give me two minutes. I will shower and come back Gautham. Let’s eat. Two minutes. ♫I am drifting apart from you. ♫ ♫ Every moment I feel sad. ♫ I will shower and come back. ♫There is no more a guarantee♫ ♫of ‘us’ ever happening. ♫ ♫Every time that we were together, ♫ ♫I made myself into your plaything. ♫ ♫You are lost in your own world. ♫ ♫Show me some care ♫ ♫By and by♫ ♫I am drifting apart from you. ♫ Didn’t you go to work? What happened? Do you have a fever? No coffee today? Yamini... Are you among those days? Gautham? Gautham? I need to talk to you. What? -I need to talk to you. Tell me, Yamini. Do you notice any change in me? Did you change your hairstyle? No. New dress? New shoes? I’ve put on weight, Gautham. I am getting fat. You’ve stopped noticing me, right? I am sick and tired of those contraceptive pills! They're bloating me. Gautham, do you remember what happened one year ago? Hey. Hi. I submitted my papers today. What? Tell me. I mean... I quit my job. With so many responsibilities... how... Yamini, you know me. Ever since I was in college, I wanted to be a writer. And you told me to take up the job. I took it up for you. If I don’t do this for myself now, I will never be able to pursue this ever in my life. But, why writing Gautham? With such growth in technology, who would be interested in reading books? You said technology, right? If a rocket has to go to space... Look at that laptop... For that keypad or laptop to work... or for us to watch a movie and enjoy ourselves, someone must put pen to paper, Yamini. Without Pen and Paper, the world is as good as dead. You doubt if people really do read books, isn’t it? They will certainly read. If you write something interesting and exciting. Anyone will read it. And I will write it. Give me an year. Will you support me? Please? That day, I was really proud of you Gautham. I was proud to be in love with a man like you. I was so proud falling in love with you. So proud sharing my life and bed with you. But what do you do on a normal day, Gautham? You wake up really late. And if there is tea or coffee around, you have it. Or else you let it be. If the food is ready, you have it Or else you starve yourself. You watch Cartoon Network like a small kid. You read books. You wait for me to come home. Have your dinner and pull me onto this bed man! This has been going on since a year and a half. If by chance you wake up early, You accompany me to a stationary shop. You buy yourself pens, papers, colour pencils and all. And you put it in this cupboard, man. This fu**ing shit looks like a stationary shop in itself. Did you ever feel like opening the bundle, fixing that paper onto a writing pad and just writing? You’ve insulted me and my unconditional love for you, Gautham. You've taken me for granted, right? If you don’t care of things they fall into disrepair, Gautham. I am a human. Apart from having a life, I have a heart too. And you took it for a ride. You completely shattered it. You’ve completely killed me and my soul. I can’t take this pain anymore, Gautham. Love is a compromise, Gautham. It is a sacrifice. There is divinity in love. But you don’t understand any of these. I am tired, Gautham. I am tired. My mind, my heart... It's just bleeding. Let’s break up, Gautham. You know Gautham.... This is not easy. How many times did I sit on this chair and wonder how to break this to you! Let’s break up, Gautham. Take care of yourself. Write well. Yamini... What do you want me to make for dinner? Do you want some Chinese? I said fu**ing breakup! Breakup means breakup! You don’t understand? Eat whatever you want. What do you mean by fu**ing breakup? Yamini! What do you mean by fu**ing breakup? Stop shouting. Everyone is watching us. Let them watch! Didn’t they watch us when we were hugging and kissing each other in love? What do you mean by fu**ing breakup? Breakup means breakup! Period. What happened to you all of a sudden? Remember you kept telling me. Gautham, I love your eyes. You have lovely lips. I love your nose. Soft skin... I love how you smell... What happened now? Did my eyes, nose and skin change? None of those things changed But you are not the same Gautham I knew. What nonsense?! What do you mean? What is the difference? The Gautham I knew loved me. What about this Gautham now? What did this Gautham do to you? This Gautham just spreads my legs. Buddy, I read your Facebook post. It’s quite long. It must be a short story. Who did you write it for? Excuse me... One second. Brother, could you help me with an address? Brother? Who is the brother here? Whose brother am I? I am Gautham. Hi, Gautham. -Hi. Can you help with the address of this auditorium? This is close to my place. What happened to the GPS? It cheated me. I’ve been moving about in circles. Do you know the directions? Aren’t you the one who danced in ‘Dhee’ dance program? What? No! Crazy... Can I hop in? Why? Well, if the GPS kept cheating you, that means the address is a bit tricky. I will show you. Okay. Nice car. Your dress is good too. Thank you. I was born and brought up in Hyderabad but, thus far no girl pierced my heart. What does piercing your heart mean? This is the address. Straight. It’s on the right. Gautham? Park the car. Me? Yeah, park it. I have a performance. Hey, listen. Make it quick. You don't want to miss it. Hey, Yamini. Make it quick. Come fast. Yamini! Hey! Who are you? Are you her brother? No. No. I am not. Even she asked me the same question. But I made it clear to her. I am not ‘Brother’. I am Gautham. Friend? No, bro. I don’t really know if we can call it that yet. Boyfriend? Boyfriend? How dare you make friends with girls from our college?! You bloody... It looks like the program started. She very sweetly asked me not to miss it, bro. I will go. Hey! Where do you think you are going? What exactly happened? Tell me. He gave up his job, Dad. He wanted to become a writer. He said he needed help. I helped him. He doesn’t write anything, Dad. Even if I am ok with all this... he lives in a completely different world. And I am not a part of that world, Dad. You kept accusing me that I didn’t write. I wrote! You kept pushing me to write, write and write. Do you think it’s easy to write? Not just one or two. I wrote ten books. When I read what I write, I feel disgusted. Writing doesn’t mean turning a white paper to black. It’s like sharing a soul. The soul is missing in these. You abandoned me because I didn’t write? I will write. I will fu**ing write... ...for you! Hey. You? Why did you hit them yesterday? Didn’t they tell you? No, they didn’t. Then it’s not important. Alright. Where is room no. 5? I don’t know. Hey, classical dancer... What? Where are the flowers? What do you mean? You would look great with flowers in this chiken dress. Do you think I am here to take an exam or accept a marriage proposal? Flowers it seems! What? Won’t you write? I am done. I was watching you because I didn’t want to waste time What’s your name? Silence! Sorry. It just slipped out of my mouth. What is your name? Yamini. Yamini... Were you born beautiful... Or you grew up to be beautiful? [11 miners dead in coal mine mishap] [11 miners dead in coal mine mishap] Look... Look how she is crying She must be of our age. Her husband died in a coal mining accident. And she is not able to let him go. She is begging him to come back to her. I am still alive, right? How could you leave me and go? This isn’t love, Yamini. Is she educated like you are? No. But she knows the value of a person. Look at how it feels when your loved ones leave you. I met you because I was born and raised here in Hyderabad. You came into my life. You became a part of my story. If I was born in Yellandu, do you think I would have met you? No! I would have met some girl like her, and gotten married to her. I would have someone who would be willing to die for me. I wish I wasn’t born in Hyderabad. I wish I never met you. If I was born in Yellandu... You... Idiot. Why did you sleep here of all places? Tea. You are here in Yellandu as well? You will leave him too. You said you wanted to leave me, right? Leave me then. Leave my writing alone as well. Suvarna. Tea. Here is your Tea. It’s been seven years since we got married. We have a five-year-old son as well. What are you so scared of? Do I hit you , scold you or eat you up? You burned my hand early in the morning. What’s up, man? Where are you headed so early in the morning? There is a car with a beacon light in front of the house. I became a civil servant. I am going to the administrative office to work. I’ve got 503 marks in my tenth grade. No officer's son in the collieries has this kind of a score. Thanks to your drinking habit you lost your arm. Because you wanted a miner’s son to become a miner, You smeared coal all over my face. And now you nonchalantly ask me where I am off to?! Where would a laborers’ son go? Of course, to labour. Didn’t you think it would be wise to wait a bit after a 20-year old took up a job? You got me married to that dimwit! Before I could even make sense of what happened, I had a 5-year-old son! And then, this constant nagging everyday! Where am I off to, you ask?! Where am I off to?! Shamelessly, you ask! Next time if you ask me, I will break your other arm. You are going to break my arm? Break it then! Break my hand then! Hey, shut it and sit down. Sit down and read your papers. Greetings... Greetings. How come you guys gathered In front of my house? You don’t need to be reminded, brother. Today is the counting day. Everyone is of the opinion that you are going to win. I got everyone along for our victory lap. Is it? But I’ll just go and drop my son off at school. Go on. Alright! Let’s go fellows. -Kiddo, get on the bike. Carefully. -Brother? The counting is going on. Come soon. -Alright, fine. I’ll come around. Hey, take off your hand. Srinu... all the best. Yadhi, come here. Brother? Call that cable guy and get the cable disconnected. Why, brother? Isn’t the cable working? The cable is doing too damn fine a job of teaching English to the ladies of the house. Call him and get it disconnected. Alright, brother. The results for the elections of the Union of Black Diamonds Coal Mine are going to be announced in some time. We request the candidates to cooperate with the officials. These sunglasses are so cool, Yadhi. That’s true, brother. Srinu, you cocky brat! The counting isn’t done yet. and you are already here at the Union office! Right here at the doorstep too. And with sunglasses too. Did you dream of winning? Listen here, Mr. Patnaik. I want to tell you something. You have been the union leader for the past 10 years. That has always been unanimous. And no one here dares to contest against you. And after ten years, If a novice like me comes along, rebels and files his nomination papers in the elections, it means you’ve lost. The counting is just a formality. In the seventh incline, Srinu has a 23-vote majority. Stop it! Don’t go celebrating your success yet. Bro, Is the entire election over with just a seven incline? With just a 23-vote majority, you seem to be so getting giddy over this victory? There is a lot long battle ahead. There is the 10 incline, 11 incline and the 23 incline. What else? -NGO, open cast. NGO, open cast and many more, bro. In the Black Diamond coal mines elections, a young mine leader Srinu, has won the election with a resounding majority. Srinu brother! Srinu brother! Srinu brother! Suvarna? Is your mom around? Why would my mom be here? She must be in the village. What about your father then? My father is with my mother in the village. Then who is going to scrub my back? I am coming. Coming. Manager sir. How many times do I have to ask you not to flash your light like that? Am I a buffalo or a goat? You must be taking me for granted just because I give your respect. I wasn’t sure if you could hear me amidst all this noise. If I can’t hear you, Climb the machine and call me loudly. If I reprimand, I am accused of being the crazy one. Set that aside. I have some work with you. Come down. Tell me... what's it? Smitha Ma’am joined as our Junior Welfare officer. You guys would be seeing a lot of each other at work. So, I thought it is best to introduce you to each other. Madam is from Mumbai, Srinu. Smitha Madam, this is Srinu. Hi, Srinu. Srinu? Sir... Srinu? Sir... Srinu? Smitha Madam. Smitha Madam. Madam, I am Srinu. I am the union leader here. Hi Srinu. I am Smitha. My hands are smeared with coal dust. What do you expect while working in a coal mine, Gold dust? It’s ok, Srinu. Shake hands. Nice to meet you. Brother, did you notice? When you were the Union leader, there was an old hag who was the Welfare officer. As soon as he became the union leader, some young lady comes down and he gets to squeeze her hand. This handshake of theirs! Did you ever shake hands in this manner, ever? Saidulu? -Yes, brother. You have no brains at all. If they are appointed, they will stick around until their retirement. If we are lucky and if there is a by election next year, won’t we win? Are you saying that you would offer your hand and squeeze hers? Is that what I said?! Go about business! Idiot! Why are you touching me? Turn that way and sleep! You... woman! Why are you throwing yourself at me? I am already suffocating because of the heat. One kick and you'll fall through the window. Why are you so angry today? So, what ? When you come to me... I will show you. Why would I come to you? -For that. I won’t come or go. Idiot! I will gouge you! Shut up and sleep. -Yeah, right! Go. What do expect while working in a coal mine? Gold dust? Everything is clear, sir. It’s clear. The blasts have begun, sir. It would take at least another hour for it to be loaded. -Mr. Srinu. Mr. Srinu. Call him... call srinu. Madam is here. Madam is here. What is it? -Madam is here. Hi. Greetings, Madam. Good morning. -What brings you here? Nothing in particular, Srinu. The Manager here said that you are the person to help me take a look at all the mines. So, I came here. Ok. Yadhi! -Yeah, Bro... I got some really important work. Madam wants me to show her the mines. I am going. Alright, fine. I will take care of it. Go on ahead. Hey! -I will take care of it, brother. I will... you go. -Come. No. No, Srinu. Sit here. ♫Hey sir, you are on a roll. ♫ ♫Impressed by your energy♫. ♫The girl has opened the door to love. ♫ ♫She is a mine of colours♫ ♫amidst a coal mine. ♫ ♫She shines brilliantly. ♫ ♫I have caught her. ♫ ♫I’ve got her. ♫ ♫She is young seductive star. ♫ ♫Wonder what you did to get this lucky, ♫ ♫Your dreams will not ever sleep again. ♫ ♫For a hillbilly like you, ♫ ♫you have found a classy jackpot. ♫ ♫Bless you, pray to Yadagiri to offer thanks. ♫ ♫ Go on, go on... oh king, ♫ ♫Have....

Even you didn’t ask me to stop drinking. And yet, this pup who is still wet behind his ears dares to give me an ultimatum? Srinu! Get down. What is this nuisance so early in the day? You asked grandpa Rattaya to quit drinking? He will drink. He will continue to drink to his fullest and come to work. What can you do? What can you do? After you became the union leader, You’ve grown horns. Mr. Patnaik. You guys discussed something beforehand. You came here and grabbed my collar. Since you're here now, why don’t you turn around and take a look? Do you want each of them to give you a beating? Won't a warning suffice? What do you say guys? Hey, calm down, brother. You take the joke too far. There is still dirt on your collar. Didn’t you have a proper bath? Couldn’t you have someone clean you with soapnuts? Didn’t sister help? Do you know how a leader should look? He should look sharp. Old man! If you drink and come here again, I will smash you. That is my warning to each one of you. If anyone drinks and comes... there is no way you are getting down into the pit and touching the coal. Do you understand? Go on. Go. Go about your business. I shall take your leave, Srinu. Hey you! Come along. Brother Patnaik. Who is going to greet me? Greetings, Srinu. Brother Srinu, I shall take your leave Pedda Babu, come here. I wish to speak something with you. You guys go on ahead. Go about your business. What is it? -You have two sons, right? So what? -What is the youngest one’s name? Karthik. -I see him hanging about the house. Isn’t he studying Bi.P.C? So, what if he is? He is capable of getting a medical seat. You know, in my 10th grade, I scored 503 marks. My father kept drinking, lost his arm and turned me into a labourer. Are you going to turn your children into labourers too? Why would you ruin their lives? Go. Go and get sober and then come back to work. Here. If you insist that you need to drink and are thirsting for it... I am going to get you on track for Voluntary Retirement. I am going to make a fixed deposit on their names. You do whatever you want. At least, they will move progress in life. Go on. Go and drink. It seems like we were born to you guys so that you could ruin it for us. Hi, Srinu. What brings you here Madam? Hi. -I am eating, madam. Okay, sit. Since I don’t have friends around here... I just thought I'll have my lunch with you. Are you having Dosa? Yes, madam. -I love Dosa. Brother, when you were the union leader, that old hag... I mean that ex-welfare officer. Did she ever come to you and have her lunch with you? She used to sit in the same room and have her meals. And this woman here, comes with such enthusiasm. She came and sat down with him as well. She is getting all chummy with Srinu. Isn’t it bothering you? You?! Are you back to that nonsense? I can see it. Stop making a ruckus. Shut up and eat. Narsingh. -Brother... Get madam a Dosa. Alright, brother. -No, I don’t need it. This will be enough for me. I will eat this. And you eat this... My lunch box. Just try it. Yadhi... Madam gave me her lunch box. I swear on my mother, madam. - What? I eat this thick bread only when I am sick, madam. If not, I don’t. This isn’t thick bread, Srinu. This is Vada Pav. People in Mumbai have this as a meal. How does one eat this? One minute. It’s very simple. Open the Pav like this, Put the Vada in it like this, And that’s it. Ready to eat. Go for it.. Take a bite. She got a bun, opened it and put something inside. As if he doesn’t have hands, she even fed him. Saidulu, I am going to kill you today. Shut up and eat. How is it? -Superb, madam. Try it with this sauce. It’s going to be better. How is it? It’s even better with this paste, madam. Paste? You are eating like a caveman! The sauce is all over your mouth, man. What?! She even licked off his saliva. damn! I am going to die, brother. How are you eating so nonchalantly, brother? You piece of shit! I am unable to take this. I couldn’t take a single bite. You... idiot. Mr. Srinu. Your son isn’t doing well in his studies. He is not performing well. He needs to concentrate. It would be better if you pay attention. What is it? Why aren’t you studying? He studies well, Madam. I've been quite busy these days with some Union work. I will take care of this, madam. Come fast. Listen, a child is a mix of two sets of genes. You don’t have education in your blood. You are not educated. And he doesn’t study well either. Not only are you shaming me at home, you are doing that to me in public now? You... Escort him to his class and go home. What’s going on? Why isn’t he still here? He must be taking... Mr. Patnaik. Looks like you have some work. Saidulu, how are you? -I am doing well, brother. Madam called me. You seemed to have lucked out. Who is it? Madam, I am Srinu. Yes, Srinu. Come in. -She is asking me to come in. I will be back. You stay here. Good evening, madam. Hi, good evening. Come in. Srinu, please close the door. Madam asked me to close the door. Really? Isn't it customary to keep the doors open while meeting a lady in her office? When that old hag was in the office, you would always keep the door open. What the! She is from Mumbai. And Srinu is a hot-blooded man. They have gone inside and closed the doors. I wonder what’s happening. I don’t understand this story at all. Saidulu. Come here once. I need to tell you something. You piece of crap! -Brother! Are you on his side or mine? If I hear another word from you, I will hit you with this bucket. Why should I care brother?! -Get lost. Why should I care brother? You saw what I saw. Why? Don’t you see it? -Sit down. Move aside. Srinu, all the 120 files and cheques are ready. Are these the files you asked for? Is anything missing? Take a look. Thank you, madam. You were pretty quick. I wonder what’s going on inside. Everything is fine, madam. But I can’t find Pedda Babu’s name. Who is Pedda Babu? I mean Rattaya. Rattaya’s name is there. It’s a big amount. It shouldn’t be missing. It must be there. I put it here myself. Kumarsamy... Manohar... Naresh, Where is it? Here it is! Oh, it is? It’s right here. My eyes! I didn’t see it, madam. It's all fine, madam. -No problem, Srinu. That’s fine. So, do you want the cheques now? As usual, credit them madam. I will inform everyone. Keep the doors open, Srinu. The heat is suffocating. When he went in, he closed the doors. And when he came out, he left them open. Pedda Babu! Come here. I’ve been looking for you. -What is it? Your insurance money is here. One lakh, ninety thousand. What do you want to do then? You tell me? Aren’t you the one always advising people? Buy a bike for Karthik. He goes to tuitions. Are you paying attention to what I'm saying? I was watching the plane. -A plane? I was thinking of buying that for Karthik. Yes. If Karthik does get himself a medical seat, I am going to buy him a plane. Everyday he would get on the plane in Yellandu and get off at Warangal. He would commute to the college in it. Don’t you think I know what to do with my money?! You already made me quit alcohol because of him. If Karthik doesn’t get that medical seat, I will deal with you then. I will get you on that wretched plane. Get lost. What the hell is he talking, brother? Let him be. Greetings, madam. -Madam, greetings. Srinu, is there a good shopping mall nearby? Mall? Yes, it’s very close by. I will ride first. You follow me. No. No. Hop into my vehicle. I will drop you back. Alright, madam. Let’s do that. Uncle... Tea. What happened daughter? What are you waiting for? Nothing. Your son didn’t come home yet and he didn’t bring my son home yet. It’s been an hour since he finished school. I wonder where he went. Srinu is not a small-time worker anymore. He is a union leader now. He must have a lot of things to do. I wonder what got him busy. Father-in-law, if that’s the case, I will go and pick him up from school. You stay right here. -Alright, fine. Go on. Don’t go anywhere. -Go on, daughter. Go on. Srinu? This colour will look very good on you. Go change and come. Me? Why do I need clothes? Srinu, my wardrobe is already full. The real reason why we came here is to buy you some clothes. Look... I can’t judge how you look when you are dressed in your uniform. But when you dress formally, you will look superb. You will surely rock it. Trust me. You'll look great. Go on and try it. Madam, please no... -Go. Oh, Srinu... Wait. When you come back... tuck your shirt in and come. Oh, my goodness! These clothes fit me just right. Wow! It’s good. Really good. But... Something is missing. Oh yeah. Come... Belt. One minute. Madam, Madam. No... I will wear it myself. How does it look now, madam? What is this, madam? It feels weird. It feels cool and smells great too. It’s perfume, Srinu. If it’s in the bottle, it has a particular kind of smell. If you spray it into the air, it has a different kind of smell. And if you spray it on me, it has a different smell. On you... Wow! Irresistible. You found yourself a beauty now, Srinu? Is that why you keep telling me not to touch you? Come home today, I will break your leg. Hello. I am back. So, what do you want me to do? Welcome you? Do you want me to sing your praises? That’s not what I meant. I simply said I am back. You were back yesterday, today and will be back tomorrow as well. Why do you need to inform me? Gosh! Why is she this angry? Listen. Won’t you get up? I came back. I washed myself and... changed my clothes. I am hungry. So, what should I do? What should you do? Won’t you serve me food? It’s right there. Serve yourself. I wonder why she is behaving like this. What have you cooked today?! I made lentil soup. Pour it and eat. Hey... Are you cured of your fear? Do you want me to come into the bedroom and take out my belt? You are getting angry over petty things. I am not angry. Just eat. I have a headache. I go out and work the whole day. But I can't get a proper meal at night. Keep the lights turned off. I have a headache. First, take a look at what’s in the cover. How does it matter what’s in the cover? I will take a look at it in the morning. Until you take a look at what’s in the cover, I will not turn the lights off. You won't live me in peace! Nothing much. Ever since I became a Union leader, I’ve been meeting a lot of higher ups. I was getting sick of this uniform. So, I bought a few pairs of clothes. And for the past two years, I didn’t buy you a single saree, right? I bought a few sarees as well. This green sari will look wonderful on you. Take a look. Stop being angry and look this way. You said your head was aching, right? Did you take a tablet? Put that saree aside and sleep. Come. Goddamn! Can’t you women control yourselves? Do you have to try on new clothes so quickly? There is Sankrati, Ugadi, Dusshera, Deepavali (festivals) and many more such occasions. Well... I thought this green sari would look good on me. That’s why I wore it. If you say... -No. No. Let it be. It looks quite good. I am letting it go today. Remember that those other sarees are for festivals and other occasions. That is all well. Today is Sunday, right? What do you want me to cook? Chicken fry or chicken stew? Go and ask your father-in-law. Just make whatever he suggests. Father-in-law? Should I make chicken fry or chicken stew? Make chicken stew. The pieces of chicken will slip into the mouth easily. Listen... Father-in-law wants chicken stew. Then why don’t you get to work? Okay. Greetings, Madam. Good morning. Good morning, Srinu. I wanted to have chicken biryani. Where can I find good chicken biryani around here? Biryani? They don’t make good Biryani in the town. I know of a restaurant at the outskirts. They make it really tasty. Do one thing, madam. Come to the park at 1 o’clock. I will get it for you. We shall eat together in the park. Hey, what are you doing? Our kid is watching us. Are you teasing me? He is off playing somewhere. We might get caught by father-in-law. Let me go. He is outside. If you stay quiet, he won’t realise. Come here. -Don’t make a mess. You are just unable to control yourself today. Anyways, what are you doing today? Father-in-law said he wanted chicken stew, right? That is why I am washing these pieces of chicken. Well, I feel like eating your Kadai Biryani. Goodness! Thank God you told me before I began making the stew. Go shower and come. I will make you delicious Kadai Biryani. Hey! You are looking divine in this green sari. Go shower and come. Hello. Yes, hello. What? You want me to come for a meeting? Why would you organize a meeting on a Sunday? Don’t you consider the fact that we have wife and children at home? What? All the members have gathered? Alright, fine. I’m coming. I just have to wear my clothes. Suvarna. I am leaving. I got a call. Apparently, all the members of the union have assembled. They said it was an urgent meeting. Wait... wait... You asked me to make Kadai Biryani and you are leaving without tasting it. Have a bite and go. Should I have a quick bite? -Yes. I am getting late.I will eat it in the night. -Wait. Wait. I will pack it for you. At least, you can try and eat there. Careful. Alright. Srinu. One minute. Just a minute. What is it? You have a large appetite. I wasn’t sure if just one lunchbox would be enough for you I packed another one for you. Srinu, I made this out of so much love. Don’t share it with anyone. Only you eat it. Alright, fine. Only I'll eat it. What? What happened Srinu? I never wore such clothes all my life, madam. Srinu, you’ve got the looks of a movie star. Wait. One minute. Look here. Look here. Look. -No, madam I don’t want to. Srinu, why are you feeling shy? -I feel weird, madam. Please stop it, madam. That lady is smoking hot. She seems to have lit up of Yellandu. Why are you guys gawking? Run away. Don’t you have women in your house? I am going to give you a whack, you idiot! The world is gone to sh*t, madam. You said you wanted to have Biryani. Shall I take the box out? Survana! I slipped. I fell down. What happened, father-in-law? -Suvarna, I fell down. I fell down. I fell down. One minute. One minute. [Groaning] Is it good? Pick the call, Srinu. You never know what kind of emergency it is. Hello. Who is it? Your father slipped from the stool while getting up and fell down. It looks like his arm slipped from the socket. The man is in great pain. We have to take him to the hospital. Where are you? Is that so? That old man fell?! Listen, do this. Take him to the Collieries Hospital. Tell them that Union leader Srinu sent you. They would be quick on their feet. Did you understand? I am in an important meeting. As soon as I finish here, I’ll come to see the old man. You... You be careful. Go safely. Safely. What happened, Srinu? Apparently, some old man fell down. I told them to take him to the hospital and inform the staff that I sent them. The number of responsibilities on me have increased, madam. Dear...Suvarna? -It’s quite close. Just a few more minutes. Suvarna. I am unable to breathe. It’s close. It’s close. Don’t worry. How is the Biryani madam? It’s very good, Srinu. It’s really very tasty. Ask Srinu to come. Yes. yes. He will certainly come. He said that he was in a meeting. It’s close. It’s close. Mom, I can smell biryani. Didn’t you wash your hands properly after you ate? Mom, there is dad. Here, take a piece of chicken. So, the smell of Biryani is from there? Not here? I told you that your father’s arm was broken. Is this the important meeting you were in, Srinu? You are checking your phone now? I told you that we need to go to the hospital. And he is in absolute misery. Look, the signal turned green. Go on. Drive. Yeah, alright. ♫The stars in the sky♫ Srinu... ♫are like the dots in the Rangoli made at dusk. ♫ It’s three right now.

Don’t waste my time. Come to the point. What do you want? No. What I meant was... We have a library nearby. Apparently, they teach us stitching. Seamstress. If you agree, I will learn. Do you need to ask me such a trivial thing? How much do we need to pay there? Rs. 2,000 Keep some of it with you and with the rest, pay the fee. Go on. Okay? Okay. Hey, get on Kiddo. Srinu... From now on, I will drop and pick him up from school. Since you are a Union leader. You must be busy and must have a lot of meetings. It will be sort of a workout for me. Alright, fine. -Okay. ♫Is it possible to change the past? ♫ ♫Is it possible to change the story? ♫ ♫Is it possible to leave it all as a dream? ♫ Good morning, madam. Breakfast? No, madam.

How come we don’t see Srinu around? Well... he is a Union leader now, right? He is a bit busy, sister-in-law. Is that so? I didn’t hear the sound of his bike recently. Yeah. He will be back, sister-in-law. -Alright, then. You have taken your life onto the streets. Why did you ruin my life too, Srinu?! Brother, Srinu! Brother, Srinu! What is it? -Congratulations, brother. I am very happy today. What’s the reason? Srinu, Congrats. Srinu, Congrats. So, this is all your doing, Mr. Patnaik? And here you are, having way too much fun?! You are really the man. When are you giving us a party? What for? From now on, you will always be the Union leader. I am telling you. Congratulations. What is with this congratulations?! -Srinu? Srinu? There she is, your madam. She will break the news to you. Go on. See you. Congratulations, brother Srinu. -Just keep walking. Move along now. Come on. Congratulations, Srinu. This is such good news. I am so proud of you. Madam, you too? They are just pulling my leg. What do you mean? Why didn’t you ever tell me that you have such a beautiful and smart wife? And you were flirting with me! Naughty. [Suvarna tops open university examination] Srinu, what’s wrong? Srinu? Are you okay? Srinu? Suvarna?! What is this? What is all this? Srinu. Shall I tell you something? Even before we were married, I completed my 12th grade. I even enrolled in an Open University. You know what my mother said? Your husband will flatter you on the bed. If he asks you about your education, don’t blurt out details about you clearing 12th grade and enrolling in an Open University. It’s because he studied only till the 10th grade. His ego is going to be hurt. And if his ego is hurt, you will have ruined your own marital life. That is the reason why... Whenever you asked me, I kept telling you that I failed my 6th grade or 7th grade. How would I know that... you like educated women. That is the reason why I studied. I studied really well. But... I never thought my education would land me in the newspapers. Do you like this Srinu? This is what you like, don’t you? You like women who dress this way. Isn’t it, Srinu? Tell me I will wear even shorter clothes than this, Srinu. If you like it... ...I would wear even shorter clothes than this. No.... If you want me to be naked, I would do that too, Srinu. What are you doing? What is all this? Stop it. Stop...no. I beg you, Srinu. Don’t abandon me and my child. Both of us have no one else other than you, Srinu. I will do whatever you want me to. I will dance to your tunes. Don’t abandon us, please. Will anyone leave Smitha and go back to Suvarna? No one does that. If anyone says that they will, he is a bloody liar. But Srinu compromised and went back to his family. Because compromise is something I do. We are what we write and what I write is in my fu**ing blood. Remember all the things she said to me? She said that love is a compromise. That love is a sacrifice. And there is divinity in love. I want to show her what I wrote. Gautham, what the hell is this man?! What have you done to the house? You are married as well, right? Don’t you spouses ever fight? Yeah, we do but we don’t break our things. This... What is this on your hand? Why did you come? What do you want with me? I am going out. You asked me to arrange for an advance of one lakh from a publisher, right? Here. Not one... But two lakhs. This is double the encouragement. My father treats you like his own son. He’s agreed to publish your book. I trust you, man. You can write really well. Please don’t let me down in front of my father. It’s ok, buddy. I started writing. My laptop is on the dining table. Start reading. I will go meet Yamini and be back. Hi Gautham. -Hi. Is Yamini there? -Yeah, she is there. Hi Yamini. Hey Pradeep. How are you? -I am fine. Yamini, I must tell you something. Srinu is a labourer in Yellandu. Means... He got a good education... a big fancy job and... wanted to marry a beautiful girl. But, because of his father, he became a labourer. And they got himself married to a dimwit. Gautham, who is that Srinu? Who is Smitha? Who is Suvarna? What are you talking? Oh, I forgot to tell you. I started writing. I want to celebrate with you. Could you take the rest of the day off? Did you eat? You usually have a headache if you don’t eat. Come. Let’s go out and eat. Let’s go to Nanking. Yamini, don’t leave the house so suddenly. Where were you last night? At your father’s? -Yamini ma’am. Do you have five minutes to spare? Ma’am is going out for lunch. Deal with it later. Okay, sir. Hi, sir. -Hi. Greetings, sir. Hello, madam. I told you not to let any Tom, Dick and Harry in without my permission. Didn’t I? If anyone enters without my permission, you are out of your job. Who was that Tom, Dick and Harry she was referring to? Not you, sir. Yamini! Who were you referring to when you said any Tom, Dick and Harry? Open. Open. Open the door. Open it. Open the door. I will lose my job. Please go, Sir. She treats me as a nobody. And just kept running her mouth mercilessly. But she will never know in her entire life, how she came about this job. What is this, sir? It’s recession right now. Layoffs are happening. Sir... I see Yamini’s name here. I know that you both are a couple. But then, family is family. Business is business. I have an idea, sir. I’ve been contemplating on quitting the job for a while now. But I am not able to. I think it’s time we talk about it. Well, if you want, we can retain Yamini. No, sir. That is not what I meant. I worked for the sake of financial security. But, writing’s been always my passion. Yamini passed out from a very good college. She is a very intelligent girl. If you give her an opportunity, she would definitely take my position within a year. I can understand. But, I wanted to send you to Paris with a better package and a better future. I am sorry, sir. I’ve made up my mind. I can’t take up your Paris offer. But, I do have a request. Please retain Yamini. Okay. Yamini, I want to... I just can’t believe it. You are stalking me now... Yamini... What do you mean by a nobody? And stalking? What nonsense are you spilling? Speak to me for five minutes. Yamini, can’t you speak to me for five minutes? What is this? I wanted to spend my entire life with you. And you completely ruined it. Now you ask me for five minutes. I don’t have fu**ing five minutes for you. Yamini! Yamini! Yamini! Yamini! stop Yamini! Yamini! Fu**ing wait for me! Yamini! Mr. Gautham... Mr. Gautham... Yamini isn’t here. Didn’t she just return from the office? Where did she go? She and her father went out. They will come back, right? Maybe in an hour or two, maybe today or tomorrow. I will wait until they come back. I need to speak to Yamini and her father. Here... I didn’t eat anything since morning. Is there anything to eat? Are there eggs? Yes. Make me an omelette. -Alright, sir. Hey! Giri...Vamsi! There is a really hot chick in the first year batch. Come on, let’s go. We've been studying together since childhood Coincidentally, we got enrolled in the same college. Excuse me... -And all of us like the same girl. Do you have a lighter? Lighter? Sabya... Buddy, things pertaining to girls usually end up in fights. Brother. -That’s true. That’s how friendships are ruined. There’s just one thing I want to say. If the girl likes anyone amongst us, she is his girlfriend. And for the rest of us, she becomes the sister-in-law. -Okay... Ok. It’s a really funny class. Who is going to approach her first? Let’s toss a coin. Yes. Let’s toss. Yes. Let’s toss a coin. Who the hell are you? -Sorry, boys. Actually, I studied management in my degree as well. I am so looking forward to it. Hey, classical dancer. Hey Gautham. Hi. -How are you? We are late to class. -Come, let’s go. Yamini, stop. Give me a hug, please. Ah! So sweet. No. no. I don’t want this side hug. I want a warm tight hug. Why did you need a hug so early in the morning? Is anyone watching us from behind? Yes, they are. They are observing us. Why? Give me one kiss One small peck. No! Are you mad? Yamini, just a small kiss. Just a peck on the cheek. Gautham... Yamini, please for me. -Everybody is watching. No! Yamini...please. -No. I won’t. No. -Yamini, I’m begging you. Alright. Turn your face. I am pursuing my M.B.A too. I cleared my CAT exam. Don’t act smart with me. If you want a kiss, turn your face. What's going on Dude...? Boys, keep the change. What’s all this? You asked of a hug and a kiss. and telling them to keep the change. What’s happening here? Yamini, I am very ambitious. I want to reach great heights. For that, I need to focus on my studies, right? This entire batch is trying to court you. And now, it will be so time-consuming to compete with them every day, If things don't workout, I might get deeply hurt... and that might affect my studies. That’s why... I asked you for a kiss to make it clear. They should also know... that we are in love. What? What makes you think I am in love with you? I know. You have to ask yourself. Shall we go to the class? He is cute, no? Damn it! Hey, Gautham! Wait for me. Product knowledge and Time management. -Excuse me, sir. Nobody walks in late to my class, Gautham. Sir, there was lots of traffic. It’s the same for whole Hyderabad too. Please get out now. I still see you here. -I’m leaving, sir. Good. What are you doing? Come with me. -What are you doing Gautham? What? We will be on time tomorrow, sir. You said that there was a very big reason for this Dosa treat. What is it? I didn’t have my breakfast. Oh really? Breakfast, huh? Stupid. You know what? What? You are born beautiful. And I grew up to be... And you grew up to be Hot...Sexy... That’s it, huh? Hey... -Stop it! You... silly. Why didn’t you come to the class? What are you doing here? Me? What are you writing? I want to excel in the field of sales. But I am a little scared of numbers. There must be a lot of people like me, right? So, for people like me, I am replacing numbers with words and in a way that’s easy to comprehend. I am trying to write a book called ‘Simple Economics’. Oh, you are a writer now? No, nothing like that. Okay, did you eat? Uh, no. Okay, let’s go eat. Come on. Let’s go. Sir... Why is Yamini behaving in such a manner? Put it there. What are these? They must be looking for matrimonial alliances for Yamini. You arrogant prick! Look what you did to my car. Sorry. -Sorry? Will everything be resolved if you just apologise? Get out of your vehicle. Get down and see. Come and see what it is. Just a minute. -Get down. Get out and see. You mad fellow! I asked you to get out. How dare you leave?! Have you lost it? You hit the my vehicle again. Get down. If you see someone is disturbed, just accept the apology and move on. See... what's now happened. I won’t leave you. Are you out of your mind? 0143. I will not leave you alone. When you are in love, Don’t take stupid emotional decisions. Look... in the end, they don’t even pick up your calls. That day, If only I had listened to my boss, I would have been in Paris earning in Euros and living the life I wanted.

Man. -What’s happening tonight? Nothing, man. You tell me what you want to do. Let’s drag. Okay. Anyone up for dragging? Yeah. I’m in. So, let’s drag. -Let’s go. Hello, Gautham. Hello, doctor. How are you today? I am good. How is your hand? There’s pain. But I’m fine. I have good news. You can go back home today. Doctor? -Yes. There was a girl with me. Where is she? Hey, Gautham. Don’t worry. She is fine. What happened to her eyes doctor? Because of the big impact, She lost her vision. But doctor... She was wearing her helmet. It saved her life. Not her eyes. We've asked for a donation from all European Union banks and Red Cross. She is now on top of the list. Now we need to wait. You asked me for one unforgettable memory... And I... I gave you a lifetime’s worth of darkness. I am sorry, Iza. I can no longer see you with such guilt in my heart. Attention dear passengers of Flight Air Lilly... Iza... Iza... It’s a night halt for us. What are your plans for the evening? How about dinner tonight? It’s been 6 months since I regained my vision. I would like to walk along the beautiful streets of this town. Let’s meet in Paris? No problem. Excuse me, madam. Gautham. Coffee, Iza? What happened to your eyes? Peter... One cappuccino please. They live on in a face beautiful than mine. They look at this world from up there. Gautham. They are travelling the globe. But Gautham... How could you decide this by yourself? And why did you not tell me? I wanted to tell you. But you were unconscious then. I didn’t know when you would wake up. Actually, I didn’t know if you would ever wake up. Gautham, stop it. Iza.... I don’t need my eyes to run a radio station. You know one of the most beautiful things about music? Even the blind can enjoy it. But I guess Air Lilly won’t accept blind pilots. Iza don’t cry. I am not crying. One of the most beautiful memories that I’ve seen with my eyes... It also happened to be my last. You telling me that you loved me. remains a permanent memory. So, this sympathy,empathy, pity... I don’t like these things. I don’t want these things. When those eyes have the same love for me as before... Come and find me here. Okay? Bye, Iza. Yamini... Why did you think I didn’t know the value of Sacrifice? I want to see the same love in your eyes again. Please come back. Why are you crying? I am the one who is sad. Why the hell are you crying? I read the Yellandu Episode. Since then, I am unable to control my tears. My father read it too. Richa read it as well. They all got too emotional. I am really proud of you, man. Here, dad asked me to give this to you. -Why do I need this now? Apparently, you writers internalize all the pain from the world outside and put it into your words. Drink, laugh, cry. Just write. Just go for it. Just write. This is your moment, man. Go for it. Buddy, take this. What is this? -This is my latest one. Read it. I have a small director’s meet. I will go home and read it. Gautham, Just call Yamini and tell her everything. She will come back to you. Trust me. Mr. Gautham. Where is Gautham? Didn’t he come? No. Yamini! Gautham, what are you doing here? Those placement companies are calling for you. Come on Yamini... my book got published. My first copy is for you. Hey, congratulations. Look who’s written the foreword. Professor Srivastava. IIM, Bangalore. This is amazing. Yamini... Everyone has a hidden talent. I feel mine is writing. I don’t want to be stuck in our jobs and stop writing. That is the reason why I am not attending those placements. Can I tell you something? This book... It’s about words and numbers, right? Yes. 24 seems to be God’s favourite number. That is the reason why he gave us 24 hours in a day. So, in those 24 hours, work for 8 hours. Sleep for 8 hours And write for 8 hours. Please don’t get offended by my suggestions. If you had parents and told me that you would write the whole day, I wouldn’t have stopped you. But... an empty stomach will not let you write well, Gautham. If not for you... For me? Please attend the interview. Alright. Do you know why I’m attending the interview? Because I told you to? No Because you told me like my mother would. Father. Hi, Yamini. This is my friend, Gautham. Hi, Gautham. Hi, Hi sir. I am so proud of you. Thanks dad We have a big company of our own and have so many properties. But, you opted to be a management trainee. That is true professionalism. Dad, Gautham got a good job as well. Congrats. What job? -Assistant Vice president, Sales. Which company? -Global Turner Technologies. Actually, I worked in sales for two years. So? Tell me, Yamini. Where do you like to celebrate with your friends? Five star? Seven star? Destination Party? No, dad. I don’t need all that. I just brought Gautham with me to introduce him to you. Yes. You did. We already shook hands. No, dad... like... Introduce... Introduce? Introduce... Introduce! Do you know what I studied? No, sir. But... I am an ITI guy. Do you know what ITI is? The kids of your generation might not know this. It’s a Trade job. And my Trade was electrical. If someone’s bulb needed fixing or the fan needed repairing, or motor needed rewinding, I was the guy. My passion for technology made me what I am today. You are all very well educated. You made it so big. You are an MBA graduate. If someone like me could do so much, how much should people like you do? You should search for a girl, manage the girl, get married to her and take care of their wealth. Right? Dad, how can you talk this way? You are not insulting Gautham. You are insulting me. You are hurting me. No. No. I am not hurting. I am just talking. Did I insult you? I was speaking plainly. What’s your opinion on our future? Future? Whose future? Mine and Gautham’s. Both of us. I don’t see any future. It’s not happening. Gautham... I am so sorry, Gautham. I didn’t expect him to talk that way. It’s ok. What should we do now? Two paths. One... Go and get married. But... If we do that... the media is going to write badly about my father. I don’t want him to lose face because of me. I don’t want that as well. Another way... Live-in relationship. Won’t the media have a field day with that? Yes. They would but it would be on page 3 And it would be about my dating life and not so damaging to my father’s reputation. Let’s live together, Gautham. Until dad agrees to get us married. What if he doesn’t? Let’s just continue to be this way then. If you are okay with this. Then, so am I. ♫ Isn’t our story about love? ♫ ♫ Can’t you recall our story? ♫ ♫ My every breath is fuelling my sorrow burning them. ♫ ♫ Won’t you please come darling and douse these flames? ♫ ♫ I can’t seem to keep my eye lids closed. ♫ ♫ These hot tears are waiting for you. ♫ ♫ With all these bruises in my heart♫ ♫ This silent sorrow is killing me. ♫ ♫ Where are you, Yamini? ♫ ♫ Yamini? ♫ ♫ Waiting for you Yamini. ♫ ♫ Where are you, Yamini? ♫ ♫ Yamini? ♫ ♫ Waiting for you Yamini. ♫ ♫ I am the beating heart. ♫ ♫ I am the sunrise, the day. ♫ ♫ Even before I could wake up and see, ♫ ♫ You are the dream that slipped from my fingers. ♫ ♫ All these days I’ve been away from you♫ ♫ Like the book abandoned left on the side. ♫ ♫ With out you by my side, ♫ ♫ Which path do I take? ♫ ♫ Where are you, Yamini? ♫ ♫ Yamini? ♫ ♫ Waiting for you Yamini. ♫ ♫ Where are you, Yamini? ♫ ♫ Yamini? ♫ ♫ Waiting for you Yamini. ♫ Gautham?

I am getting married in three days. I am giving you the auspicious first card that’s offered to God. And I don’t want you to think that I cheated on you. Because I didn’t. That’s the reason why I got it here myself. I am so sorry, Gautham. You are not getting married to someone else. This is not correct. Go and ask your dad to cancel this wedding. You are not getting married. We tried Gautham. But it didn’t work out. Not all relationships work out. We’ve been in love for four years. We’ve been in this house for a year and a half. How can you get married in three days? Are you mad? What is your problem now? That I’m not writing? I am telling you that I am writing. This is exactly what’s been happening for a year and a half, Gautham. I can’t take it anymore. No, you are not getting married. This wedding is not happening, Yamini. I am getting married. Yamini, please. You are not getting married. Yamini, please cancel this wedding. Yamini please. I’ll take care of you. -Gautham, No! I’ve started writing. Gautham, you have to understand it’s not working and we have to move on. Then GO! GO! Why did you come back here? You left me, didn’t you? Why did you come here to tell me that you are getting married? You want me to be happy for you? Do you want my blessings for your wedding? Go and marry whoever you like. No.... No... Yamini... I did not just spread your legs, Yamini. I loved you. I loved you, Yamini. Yamini... I am sorry Yamini. I spoke nonsense in my anger. Gautham... I’ll join you. Yamini... You want to talk to her, right? Let’s behave like grownups. Please, let’s go inside and talk. Come. When you guys were living together, I never interfered. Yamini told me that she was done with you. That is when I fixed her wedding. And you have no bloody right to barge in like this. What is it now? You wish to speak to her, right? Go. Talk. Yamini... I shouldn’t have behaved that way with you. This morning, I spoke nonsense in my anger. But I didn’t mean it Yamini. How can you marry a stranger? Alright, we fought. But for all the good days, give me two hours. I want to talk to you. There will be fights after marriage as well. Will you go and get a divorce then? Yamini, please. Talk to me. I’ve started writing. If you want, I’ll leave that as well. I’ll do a 9 to 5 job. I will be with you. I will come with you to the office. Yamini, we will sort this out. Please, let’s go home. I’m sorry, Gautham. What do you mean sorry, Yamini? Please leave me. Yamini, come home. We will sort it out. No. No. -Yamini...Yamini... We will sort it out. Enough. You are done. Uncle, you said something to me. Do you remember... You told me that you are not that well educated and yet you made an empire for yourself. You know why? Because you bloody loved money. Not everybody loves money. I loved you daughter. I only... I only loved Yamini. Is that so? People should always get what they love. Call your love. If she comes to you, take her with you. I won’t stop you guys. Yamini! Yamini! Yamini! How unfortunate! Did I damage your car? Let me fix that for you. If the scar in my heart... needs to forget the pain that it’s going through, physically, at the very least, I must bleed this much. Now, I literally feel the pain. So, what now? Should we fight? Come. Brother... Stop it. Leave him... Leave me. Hey, leave him... let him go. Leave him... Leave him. Leave him. Leave him. Leave him. Leave him. Brother... -Leave him. Brother... -Leave him alone. Hit me. Are they your friends? At least you have them. I don’t have anyone. Do you think this is pain? I neither have a father nor a mother. And the girl that I love... is no longer with me. No. Even if I die now, I have no one to cry for me. How can you do this to me, Yamini? I love you, Yamini. I love you. Come back to me, Yamini. You are listening to Mirchi 98.3. [Listening Radio] It's hot... And I am your host Bhargavi. The author of the book ‘World Famous Lover’ is going to be released from prison today. The unfinished story of Gautham and Yamini... that was published, sold five million copies... and created a sensation. Gautham is going to discuss the ending of his story amidst his fans and well-wishers. See you all in the evening. Until then, listen to this beautiful song. Stay tuned. 98.3 Mirchi. It's hot Gautham. Let’s go. Come. Please, please hold on. Please hold on. What are you doing? Wave at them and smile. Excuse me. Please hold on. Thank you. Thank you so much. Please move. Please. Get in... fast. We will send a press release. Hold on. Please move. Get in. Welcome home, Gautham. Your books and laptop are there. And your reviews... What are you doing there? Come in. Can we go to your house? That is your house. You can come and go whenever you please But that’s not the point. I will tell you, come. We have a press meet now. And later, you have a signing event with your fans. You will have to tell them the conclusion of your book ‘World Famous Lover’. There are a lot of things like that. I will take care of them. I’ll tell you. Hello. Yamini... Are you among those days? You stop noticing me, right? If you don’t care of things they fall into disrepair, Gautham. I am a human. Apart from having a life, I have a heart too. I can’t take this pain anymore, Gautham. Let's break up Gautham. Gautham I am getting married. Gautham I am getting married. Gautham. What are you thinking? After I read that book, I understood something. Our elders always say... "Everything that happens is for our greater good." Perhaps, this is the greater good. If those things did not happen to you, you wouldn’t have written this book. Maybe you wouldn’t have been this successful. Buddy, you don’t understand how lucky you are. Even after you hit that person with a stone, he survived. You got out of the prison in two years. Tell me of any book in the world that has sold 5 million copies without a conclusion? Listen to me Gautham. Please. Give that book a climax and begin a new chapter in your life. The world is waiting for its world-famous lover. Come on. Let’s go. Thank you. Thank you so much. I think, it’s the first time in India... that an author and his work got such recognition. Thank you so much. I read somewhere that... a life without meaning and a book without ending are both useless. But that’s not true in this case. Sorry, Gautham. We published this book without your permission, through CC publishers. I think it’s because of our friendship... Or because of the motivation I felt after reading this book, Is what made me publish this book. Without any further delay, I invite my brother The 'world famous lover' himself... Gautham! With so much enthusiasm... you’ve been eagerly waiting to listen to end of the story... We love you, Gautham! What happened to Yamini and Gautham? After Gautham came out of the jail, Yamini awaited Gautham with all her heart and tears in her eyes. Even after two years, she didn’t get married. This can be written as the climax of a story you read in book. But this is not a book. This is my life. The story of Yamini and Gautham that you guys read in the book ‘World Famous Lover’, is our story. And In real life, no one waits. We have to live with our mistakes. In life, there is no backspace button like in computers. You cannot delete the things you don’t like and rewrite them. Yamini is my only family. I spent most time with her compared to my parents When I wanted to be a writer, she supported me. Can you support me for a year? She was with me when I was struggling to write. She was with me when I was writing this book. But now, as I stand before you. she is not with me. She is with her own family somewhere. I miss her. When I think about it, I don’t know about the book. But in life, I am a failure. I failed to understand the one person who was with me every step of my way. I thought I made a huge sacrifice when I let go of my job. I felt that she didn’t understand me even though I compromised a lot. When I wrote Srinu and Suvarna’s story... remember Srinu left Smitha behind and returned to his wife. I thought Srinu compromised a lot. I thought that the compromise in that story came from the writer in me. Srinu wasn’t the one who was compromising. It was Suvarna. I was not the one who compromised. It was Yamini. In the Paris story, when Gautham sacrificed his eyes for Iza, I thought that, the sacrifice came from me. The sacrifice that Gautham made in Paris did not come from me. It came from Yamini. Yamini left her home and family. She left them behind because of her love for me. I stopped loving her the way I used to, when we first met. She looked after me like a mother would. And then one day, it became too late. All the stories that I’ve written, the characters in them, All the compromise, sacrifice and the divinity in love, that the characters show, came from the life that I spent with Yamini. The title ‘World Famous Lover’ for this book, isn’t for me. It’s Yamini’s. My 'world famous lover' is... Yamini. The only desire I have is that... wherever she is, she stays happy. Thank you Hi, Gautham. You were right. I loved money. No regrets. In my blind ambition to earn money, I didn’t take care of my wife’s health. She died. And I deserve that pain. But, the pain that you guys give me, Is not what I deserve. I didn’t come here to tell you that I’ve changed or that I understand your choices. I came here to ask you to distance me from this pain. As soon as she found out that you were in Jail, she called off her wedding. She was sure she wouldn’t be happy with you in jail. And so, she confined herself at home for two whole years. She spent those two years in desolation. Even though she didn’t commit the crime, she subjected herself to punishment along with you. My daughter did not even have the courage to meet you. What did you say? You want her to be happy wherever she is? How could you wish for something like that? She can never be happy. Leave me alone. Just leave me alone. Sorry Yamini. I want to erase all the pain that I’ve given you and rewrite it with love. Do you know the way home? Gautham Let’s go home.
