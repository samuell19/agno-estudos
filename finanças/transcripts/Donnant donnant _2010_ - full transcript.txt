FAIR IS FAIR Constant Billot, visiting room! 20 minutes. - We have 20 minutes. - You have lots of time, of course! Not me. So much to do! - You?re lucky. - Sure! Sometimes I think I?d like to swap places. Anyway... Did you finish the crosswords I sent? They?re not my thing. Why not return them, then? I did all mine. Anyway... - How?s business? - Hell. Luckily, I have G?rard. G?rard? Yes, G?rard. - Haven?t I mentioned him? - No. Really? Maybe not. G?rard is... - He?s... ? - Well... Your replacement, until... Until what? You think I?ll go back when I get out? I?ve been here five years. Screw double - glazing! You?re never happy. It?s such a drag! You?ve become such a grouch! Never positive! Is that any fun for me? Time goes slowly as it is... What about for me? If you did the crosswords it would go faster! It?s not like I shot the bank manager! You know it was an accident. The gun just went off. Caroline! Don?t you believe me anymore? I believe... I want a divorce. I?ve met someone. G?rard, right? He?s the arsehole you?re screwing! - Don?t be vulgar. - It?s disgusting! Like killing a father of four! Damn it! It was an accident, I told you. The gun just went off! Well, G?rard was an accident too. It just went off! And I don?t think your guy had as much fun. Goodbye, Constant! She?d never have waited anyway. Okay, Lucien. Leave me alone. Six years! Six more years rotting in here! Three. If all goes well. And in all that time, I can?t even... pick any apples. Just that. Pick apples. Pick cherries. - You had an orchard? - No! No, I had a PVC company. That doesn?t mean l didn?t eat fruit! My mum loved mushrooms. Especially parasol mushrooms. I swear we found enough to feed a brass band. And this idiot hunter... His bullet came that close to my poor mother. He nearly killed her. I ran after him in the forest. I grabbed him. I picked up his gun. He thought I was going to shoot. He ran off, I ran after him, and... I stumbled. It was an accident. The gun just went off. They said I shot him in the back like a coward. When they brought me here, Mum died of grief. So who?s the murderer? Me or the guy who shot rabbits and killed Mum? Men are the judges, not rabbits. Or mothers! If mothers judged, no son would be in jail. Constant! Watch your ciggie! Look! Fireworks! Like a firing range in colour! Constant? Guard! Guard! Yes, just as I thought. He?s had a stroke. - He killed his mother with mushrooms! - Horrible! Those magic mushrooms are bad news. Magic? Not his mother, a banker. - He poisoned a banker? - No, he shot him. Poisoned by a bullet? Nonsense! Doctor, he?s coming round! Mr Billot? Mr Billot, can you hear me? Squeeze my hand for yes. He can hear me... Mr Billot, you had a stroke. A cerebrovascular accident. Can you speak? Very good. Can you touch your nose? Almost! What?s two plus two? Wave when I say the right answer. 2 + 2 = 1? 2 + 2 = 3? 2 + 2 = 2? 2 + 2 = 5. What are you doing? 2 + 2 = 7? Almost! Do a Doppler test. ?Without a word... ?the man sat down... ?in the armchair.? Stop. Perfect. What are these, Mr Billot? Cubicles. Cubicles? Almost. Tentacles? Read on, Mr Billot. ?He put his spectacles on...? Spectacles! Good! After a stroke, people can often read words that the brain can?t recall. To progress, you must read, Mr Billot. Read anything. Anything. Read, read, read. ?Noddy takes the red car.? Good. ?He?s very constant.? No, Constant is you. He?s con... - He?s con... - Yes... Constipated. The doctor said you have to read. Anything... A manual, Noddy, or Great Expectorations. I?ll take this up. Need me? No, it?s all fine. I can?t stay here. Not another night behind bars! See this? Good as a gun. Lie down. Quick! In five minutes, we?re free! Guard! Quick! He?s dying! Get up! Move and I?ll slice your carotid! Stay there or I?ll slice his carotid! Move it! ?Noddy stops at the red light.? Groove and I?ll slice your marmalade! Your marmotid! It?s a vegetable! A vegetable! Witlof... Leek... lettuce... Carrot... id. Carrot-id! Carotid! Carotid! Slice your carotid! Your night-time sedative, Mr Billot! Groove and I?ll slice your leek! Your tomato! Your tomatid! Don?t groove! He?s where? Don?t groove! Botch it! Groove and I?ll slice your... Are you going to rape me? I?m a really bad lay, I swear! Please don?t kill me! I know what you did to the banker... It was an askident! The gun just witlof! Understand? Witlof! Oh my God, my God! Don?t be-be scared. Here, it?s all I have. I swear, this is it. Go on, take the lot! Oh, my God! What is it you want, then? This is a rape, isn?t it? No, no. I need clo... clothes. That won?t work on you. We?re not the same size. You ran away from the hospital? Scared of surgery? You might be right. That?s how my poor L?on went. Heard of the Norman Conquest? That was him. One hour at the hospital and my Normandy man was conquered! He was from Bayeux. You know, the tapestry? Not that! That?s my poor L?on?s wedding suit. What can I get you? Coffee? - A foreigner? - Yes. A spectacular hospital escape last night by Constant Billot who was having stroke treatment. He was serving eleven years for the murder of Maurice Eisenstein. Police say he can?t have gone far as he has no money and is wearing pyjamas. Is... is anybobby there? Good morning. Melchior needs a walk. And hello to you! Sleep well? I dreamed I was dying. Bliss! Silvia, no. It?s lovely out. Don?t you want the shutters open? Why? You just have to close them later. That TV?s blaring! It?s just talk, talk about life. Life outside. There are people who live outside. Go and join them. No one?s stopping you. Paris awaits! Go, go! How? Do you know the cost of living in Paris? He?d gone to pick mushrooms with his mother when he shot banker Eisenstein in cold blood. He is still on the loose and must be considered dangerous. Earlier he used a young nurse as a human shield to escape. Our reporter is at the scene. We were rehabilitating him because his stroke affected his speech. I'll never forget his face, his cold eyes and that nose... the nose of a killer! Come on. Melchior, come here! Melchior, no! You?ve reached the police. Please hold. Your number has been identified. You?ve reached the police. Please hold. Don?t move! - I said, don?t move! - Don?t zoot! Shoes off. Now! In the bag. Hurry up! I done nothing wrong. That?s not what the TV says! - Now, trousers off. - Trousers? Do it now! Come on! That?s enough. Like that, you won?t go far. - What you want? - A favour. Once you?ve done it, I?ll let you go. If you refuse... I?ll call the cops. It?s not toaded. Ole, ole, I?m mistening. Good. I... I?m coming into an inheritance. Doof for you. Don?t make fun of me! You know what I?m saying. - No. - I?m saying... the person I?m inheriting from is still alive. Understand now? No... You have to get rid of this person for me. What? Me, krill? That?s right. Kill. I couldn?t. - But you?re used to it. - Me, used to it? Nether! I?d nether loo dat! The bag, quick! Very well... You?d rather I call the cops. Welcome to the Weather Line. Your local weather... Hello, police? Ole, I?ll loo it. It?s my mother. My adoptive mother. You?d be doing her a favour. She?s been so depressed since Paolo died. - Paolo? - Her husband. Every Sunday morning at eight she goes to his grave. She goes via the woods. There?s never anyone there. Get rid of her this Sunday morning and on Sunday afternoon... you?re free to go. Who?s on the boat? It?s... a friend of mine. - Why is he in his underwear? - Oh, yes... Amazing, isn?t it! - They do that over there. - Where? Yes, he?s... Finnish! You know what it?s like. The lakes, the fjords and all... They?re always hot! You know, they roll their babies in the snow at birth! No one goes on my boat! I'll talk to him. No! He doesn?t speak a word of French, only Finn. Finnish! In Finland, they speak Finnish. Jeanne, please, just for a few days. What does he want with my boat? - He?s an artist. - A painter? That?s right, a painter! He?s working on an exhibition. The theme is... the canal. He can?t stay there. There?s no water, nothing. He?s an artist! - Yes, he?ll get paint everywhere! - No! Paolo wouldn?t do that. That?s right. Oh, of course. Paolo, like... Like my poor Paolo. - Not a very Finnish name. - Paolo? Not a Finnish name? With all the immigrants there? Will he stay long? If all goes well, he?ll be leaving on Sunday. Tell Silvia you need to practice your scales more. I asked to learn judo, not piano. Should have learnt enunciation! - What is it? Don?t want to play? - No. Fine. You?ve got 30 minutes to go. At least hit the keys a bit. My mother?s here. Jeanne! - There?s a man on your boat. - I know. And he is... ? A friend of Silvia?s. - Someone she... ? - I don?t know. - You must have spoken to him! - He speaks Finnish. Lucas, not so loud. Well, you ought to know he only wears underpants. - He was rolled in the snow. - In the snow? When he was born. He was found in the snow when he was this big. Shocking. To abandon a baby in the snow! - That?s the Chinese. - He?s Chinese? He speaks no French, only Chinese. There he is! He has no pants on! His eyes aren?t slanted. Not bad looking. A bit of a gut. He must have been a sumo wrestler. Reading for you... Spectacular Escape from Hospital Now then... you?re called Paolo and you?re a Finnish painter. You don?t speak French. Your latest work. Perfect. It?s her! She walks, she breathes, but she?s dead. Everyone?s dead here. I won?t end up like them. I deserve better. You?d krill an immocent woman for that? Kill an innocent woman? I?m the innocent woman! She killed me! In the orphanage there was a piano. Everyone listened when I played! I was happy in Bucharest. She and Paolo came and took me away. I was 13! I played here for years! Every weekend I got the old folk dancing! If they?d given me a teacher, if they?d pushed me, if they?d loved me, I?d be giving concerts all over the world by now. I played for free for 15 years. Don?t you think she owes me? Yes, she owes me that money! When I get the inheritance I?ll move to Paris. I?ll go to the best music school. One day... I?ll be a concert pianist! So what do I krill her with? My bare hands? I can?t! I can?t. This? I can?t... She?ll... she?ll scream. I can?t! That?s only in pilms. But not... My bicycle pump?s been stolen. You never cycle. Your cooking?s burning! I know! A brand new pump! It?s that foreigner. Now we have to lock the doors. To think I met your mother on that boat! - That Chink... - He?s a Finn. Same thing! He looks like Vincent, doesn?t he? I?m talking to you. Why won?t you talk, Charlie? I miss him too, you know. He can?t be eating properly. He must have lost weight. Who makes him potato gratin now? ?My dear sister... ?Supplies aren?t getting through. ?For the first time, ?I ate rat.? ?For the first time, I ate rat.? ?It tastes like cat, ?but stringier.? They?re Paolo?s. He collected old postcards. I?ll sleep... here. No need. Me not leave. Me not trust you. ?Darling Mum... ?The weather?s fine at last here in Verdun ?and the mud in the trenches ?is starting to dry out. ?But it?s still chaos. ?Thanks, General Foch!? Reading all of them? I?m practicing my miction. ?The mud in the trenches is starting to dry out. ?But it?s still chaos. ?Thanks, General Foch!? ?Our Corporal, ?Paul Parpin, ?had both feet amputated.? ?Corporal Paul...? Parpin! ?... both feet amputated. ?Corporal Paul ?Parpin... ?both feet amputated.? But he doesn?t even have a bike! First the pump, then the bike! - In the end, your wife! - That would make him a real pervert! He?s not going to mess us around. First, find the pump. We need proof. That?s right, we need proof. Slow down. There are holes. - Hello. - Hello. Okay... You see pump? Pump! It won?t be the same word where he?s from! He?s just playing dumb. Keep him busy. I?ll look for it. Right, keep him busy. Lovely! The snowflakes... Me think that beautiful. Bootiful. Bootiful! Boot-i-full! Victor, you can?t say everything with shoes! So, my pump... Here! Got it! Arsehole! - It?s not your pump? - Yes. Well, almost. Okay, arsehole! Where?s the other one? Why take your pump if he already has one? Do like your parrot. Shut up! Calm down. Will you be calm when he?s raped your daughter? The poor thing?s terrified. I?m so sorry. I?m ashamed for the whole canal! Hasn?t he suffered enough? Left in the snow as a baby... Okay, Yeti! Where you put pump? Found it, next to your drill. We have to go now. What?ll it be? Not the rope. Can?t do a ping with the rope. - It?s too short. - What? Do you want to lasso her? It?s to strangle her! Okay, not the rope. It?s not a butter knife! Okay, not the knife. That leaves the sledgehammer. To be honest, that?s what I?d use. Not like that! With both hands... Like this... See? It?s not hard. She?ll come this way. The cemetery?s over there. You have to... before she gets there. But she wight not come. She?ll come. She always does. Constant... Listen up. If I see her coming back, I?ll go to the cops. You won?t have time to get far. Okay... Here?s some money. Goodbye, Constant. You?re free. Good luck... with everything. You went out? I thought you were asleep. I wanted... The bakery was closed. I?m off. Will you look after Melchior? - You?re not taking him? - Not this time. You could get dressed, Jeanne. Just this once. No need where I?m going... The cemetery, right? Indeed, I?m going to the cemetery. Take care of yourself. To a waltz?s tune my heart caught fire, though I was by the water. On a Sunday with your hands on my hips I looked in your half-closed eyes. I saw a whole world where I?d feel good, full of happy children. And as we shared that simple dance my head turned to you forever... Madram... Madram... Paolo! Yesh... There you go. Silvia, some cheese? Your mother likes it. - I?m worried. - Some Roquefort? She hasn?t come home. Or some Fourme? My Fourme is lovely. Horace, I?m worried! What could happen to her? Mauricette! Mauricette! Give her some Roquefort. Coming! I?m worried. Okay? It suits you! You?re the same size as my poor Paolo. Me go. Heaven sent you! They weren?t ready for me up there. You don?t understand French? Swear you won?t understand what I?m going to say. Swear! I?ll say it, then. In my whole life, my heart has fluttered twice. The first time was when I saw Paolo?s smile. It was love at first sight. The second time was when I saw you, Paolo. Me Paolo. Paolo was called Paolo, like you, Paolo. I loved you at first sight, too. I made you a nice toddy. I?ve washed your things. Then, me dry... Then, me iron... Then, me give back to you. If he hadn?t been there... Oh, my goodness! My sweet Jeanne! - Why did you do it? - It?s over now. That?s good. He understands nothing? Because it?s funny, in my mind he had more muscles. He?s an artist! Demis Roussos is an artist, too. Seen his shoulders? He?s a real man. When I?m loving you, I no longer know who I am. A beggar or a saviour... Me go. When I?m loving you... Going to paint? Paint? Jeanne? Oh, Melchior... Oh, there you are! Oh, my dear... Your poor mother, it?s terrible... I thought so. I had a premonition. I knew it, how awful! Oh, Eric! My God! What?ll become of me? Why are you here? She was more than a mother to me! She was like... like... - A father! - No, Silvia... I bought her cheese... Roquefort! She used to take out the mould. There wasn?t much left but the little there was, she ate it with such pleasure! She takes the mould out of Roquefort? - The blue bits? - Green. But it?s the best bit! Yes, it is. I?ll never eat Roquefort again! Ever! - You will, and your mother too, tonight. - What? But she must stop taking the mould out. She?s... ? She?s in her room... recovering her strength! Bye, Paolo. - He has to go. - Really? - Paint dries fast. - No! He?s in no hurry. I?m sorry, I?m so selfish. I won?t do it again, I swear. She thought you were gone forever. She was in tears! - Really? - Oh, yes. If he hadn?t been there... A few seconds more and... - You have him to thank. - Thanks! You can do better than that, Silvia. He saved my life! Thanks! You?ll pay for this. Back to jail for you. - Happy now? - No! If you hadn?t been there... Thanks! That?s enough. He doesn?t understand anyway. - Are you going out? - Yes. I need to see someone. Coming to the police station? Fine. What do you want? You want to nurther Jeanne or get the cash? What?s your dream? Wasn?t it to be consett piapist? You make no sense when you?re mad. Don?t have to murker Jeanne. I have a flan. A super flan. A flan? A plan! Yes, a super plan. Buying time to save your skin! Mooge! - What the... - Mooge! What the hell are you doing? Stop the car! You?re mad! Let me out! Stop! Yes, I?m trying to save my skin! It?s mormal, isn?t it? You don?t want my flan? Ole! You masked for it. PIN? 2436. Now I?ll spangle you. No one will find you here. Is that what you want? Fink farefully, Vilsia! Is that what you want I do? It?s so easy. You?re so teeny-tiny. Teeny-tiny neck, teeny-tiny smoulders, teeny-tiny arms... Look! Do you feel what a teeny-tiny scrap of a thing you are? I can feel your heart. Like a litter rabbit caught in a car?s headlice. I could... Then, free. I want to help you. You owed that money. Yes, you deserve better. Yes, when you play, it?s like a waterfall. A litter waterfall flowing impside. It drowns you... drowns you in warmth and you feel all cold and dry when it stops. You talk almost normally when you?re calm. And he jumped in, fully dressed. It?s not like you?d run off to get your swimsuit! Poor Jeanne. Who?d have thought? She?s always so... so... - So... - Well, so... So aquatic? So depressed. Yes, but suicidal? How could we tell? Six years in her nightie might have been a sign! And the shutters always closed. The swimming champ! Jeanne, go back to bed. You shouldn?t be up. Eric, I need you to dye my roots. Jeanne, it?s not your roots... No, you don?t have roots. - No. - No. No roots? My hair has no roots? You all have hair with roots, but not me. How does it stay on? With glue? Very well, I?ll go to a real hairdresser. Okay, okay! Come on. I?ll fix it all up for you. Easy. A few highlights... a few centimetres off the length. Okay, so to set up on my own, let?s say thirty thousand will do. You?ll get the shirty grand. I can pervade her. Persuade her? You? That?s your plan? It sucks! She?s always said no. But now she?ll help me out just to please you? - Shove at first light. - Love at first sight! Who for? Me. Jeanne?s fallen for you? Jeanne and you... She?s in love with you? You can?t underpant. Your heart only beats when you?re scared. A layered cut is nice, isn?t it? Charlie, you could answer me. Oh, ever since Vincent left he hasn?t said a word. How will you persuade her? You don?t speak French. I just need fun hour alone mith her. - You?re sure of yourself. - No, of her. Mum! Mum, Paolo?s here. He?s asked after you. Can he come in? Maybe two hours, okay? I?ll see what?s going on. Meet me on the boat. Or a bob? Bowl cut? - Eric! - Up here! Well? A bowl cut? A nice one! Paolo and I were looking for you. - You scared us. - He was worried? Very. - What?s... ? - My roots. - You? - I have them like anyone else. Paolo saved your life. And I think it would be good if you... Time to rinse! Just a minute. I wanted to buy him a gift but I don?t know his tastes. So I thought maybe... invite him to dinner... at my place... tonight. Yes. Good idea. Time to rinse! You?re invited to dinner! Eight o?clock. She made it clear that I?m not invited. Something wrong? You were right, she?s completely crazy about you! - I told you. - Unbelievable! - What did you do? - Nil. Xerox. But the first time you saw her, what exactly happened? Jeanne... Drowning, yes. I took her out water. She was lying like that. And? So I did this... Nothing. - You felt her pulse? - No, I... To see if someone?s dead, you feel their... Carotid! - That's it. - No. - You pinched her nose! Why? - For... Oh, mouth-to-mouth! Then what? Then I... And Jeanne... nothing. And then? And then I started again. That... Is that enough to... ? Yes. Melchior, basket! Good evening. I made some fish. Raw! Like in your country. But there?s no reindeer. We don?t have that here. On the other hand... Vodka... we have! I know that where you come from, you often eat on the floor. That?s why... We don?t. We, chairs! It?s like a picnic. Pick... Anyway... I do underpant French. I can speak it a bit, too. I learned in Finland. I lied, cebause... I didn?t want people to sleek to me. I wanted to be alone to soncentrate on my painting. It will be our secret. And Silvia? No! She doesn?t snow either. Oh, no, we Finns don?t kriss straight astray. We... forghei! What?s that? Forghei is... Respect. We do nothing. No kisses, nothing. And the more loo yike sumwun, the longer it lasts. You?re kidding. Nothing? Yez. - For how long? - Oh, months! Wow! So this forghei can last a long time? Oh, yes. You like me? How nice to be liked! For you, my love, I?ll always keep inside me that tune you would whistle... No, no, it?s not over yet. Oh you, my love, I?ll always want you right by my side to waltz with... Bedtime now. Hands off! Forghei! Oh, that?s... It?s... This old thing? I just wear it around the house. You and me... It?s infossible with Silvia here. She has to go away. Paolo, you?re making plans already! She has to go away to Paris. - To perfecto the piapio. - Paris? She can?t afford an apartment there. She can't. - You can. - Me? I have no money. She?ll just have to manage. Oh, no, no! That?s not my Jeanne storking like that. My dorable Jeanne. I know that in there, a fart beats. A fart this big. 30,000 euros... to help her start a lew nife. That?s quite a start! Once she?s in Paris I could come and set up my studio in her bedroom. And I?d pose for you. Yesh. And I?ll taint you. And we?ll have fog lyres every day. Is all that true? Say it. Is it really true? It is. Because you?re a man and you are kind You make our life beautiful. You are as happy as an Italian When he knows he?s getting love and wine. It?s like the first time... The radio! It?s blaring. Look at the time. It?s nearly noon! How did it go? What? Your dinner. He ate it all up. - Did he leave late? - Early. Very early! And you? I went clubbing. It was great. - You?re dressed up. Got a date? - Yes. - Who with? - With me. I?d lost touch with myself. You?re right, Paris awaits you! I?m sure you?ll be a great pianist. Now then... Here?s the train timetable. There?s one tonight at 8.38, but it?s not direct. Tomorrow morning at 6.40. Direct, but early. Fran?oise will find you a place. I said no more than 1000 euros. That?s plenty. You can get an upright piano. Save the grand piano for when you?re famous. Well? You?re kicking me out? Typical! You say you don?t have the money to go to Paris. I give it to you and now I?m kicking you out? I thought you?d thank me. Sorry. Thank you... Thank you very much. I love you madly... Didn?t get much sleep? Congratulations. Mission accomplished. You?ll be able to go. 30,000! That?s... funderwool. She even gave me the train times. Paris... So there?s a brain tonight, but not direct. Motorrow norming at 6.40. It?s early, but... it?s direct. You too? You want to get rid of me? You?re in it together? Now look, Vilsia. Isn?t Paris what you wanted? - And the money? - Yes. It is. And what about you? You?re free now. You can go. Isn?t that what you wanted? Yes... There you are. We have what we wanted. Funderwool. At last... Yes! I can do what I want at last. I?ll meet wonderful people who aren?t wanted by all the police in France and who pronounce words normally! Vorry if I had a cereal-vacuous askident! Vorry! Vorry if I can't have a popper conversation. Well, you managed to keep one going till 7 a.m. What did you talk about? Vorry. I did what I had to for you. Bye, Melchior. Goobeye. Goobeye, Vilsia. Silvia! You can manage Melchior! But my name? You make more effort to say my dog?s name than mine! And what?s my name? Is it Paolo! Is that my name? What is it? They lock up the schizos but don?t watch them. Those psychiatric hospitals are like sieves! I?d put them all on an island surrounded by sharks. - They?d lose their legs! - For fure. A legless schizophrenic would be less trouble. But no, they treat them! He?s already killed 2 guys with a screwdriver. Yes, really! When they?ve treated him, will he work in a hardware store? Crazy! If it was up to me... There are coughs everywhere. - Are you frying? - What? No. In that case... You were frying. No. You are. - You?re frying. - I?m crying, not frying. Chips fry! But why? I do what I like with my eyes, okay? What?s all this about the cops? You don?t really want to go, do you! You came back for her, right? Yes. You don?t know her! She?s a monster. She only thinks of herself. I only think of her, too. I don?t believe it. You fell in love... just like that? You bring someone back to life, you give her mouth-to-mouth... She brought life back to me. I can?t breathe without her. I need... her mouth on mine. Silvia... We have to go, Constant. The two of us. Police everywhere. Wait a day or two. You?re here? I came to get Melchior. You?re leaving us for Paris? We?re not good enough? What?s that? We?re going to fix up the boat. It?s a big job. Paolo?s here. He?ll give us a hand. Tomorrow night we can have a dance! It?s good. It?s only a start, but it?ll be good. Want some? Some wine? Sheherazade... You were my sweet lifeguard and now I feel like Sheherazade... I?m going to bed. I?m done. Sleep well. My nights are so romantic and my life is... And my life is... Like a bottle... Like a bottle in the sea... We?re an hour from the German border. Let?s go there until things calm down. No, Silvia. You?d be messing up your life. I?ll go alone. You?re going to Paris. No! - I?m coming with you. - Listen, Silvia... I killed someone. It was an askident. You have your whole life ahead of you. I don?t want to kill that. That wouldn?t be an askident. My life ahead of me? What life? Music? Pieces and pieces of music! Like my life, a life in pieces. For once I have something that?s whole... You?d deny me that? To think you wanted to turn me in! I never called the cops. It was the Weather Line. And they said it would be fine. My life I wanted to drop, I chose to jump in and go plop. My life I wanted to drop, I chose to jump in and go... This is Radio Menyville. It?s 4 p.m. Here?s a news flash. Police are still looking for Constant Billot who killed banker Maurice Eisenstein and escaped from a Lyon hospital. We?ve just learned that the banker?s widow has offered a 200,000 euro reward for the capture of the man who is still on the run. Here?s G?raldine Eisenstein. My children and I want justice. I?m prepared to give a reward of 200,000 euros to anyone who helps arrest this man. We have to leave. Tomorrow. Don?t move... Right. Open the window. Open your eyes! I look so beautiful! Thanks, Eric. I?ll get dressed. Bye, Charlie. He still won?t say anything? - Hang on... - See you later. All this hair! Hello, Eric. Hello, Eric. Charlie?s a pretty boy. Vincent! Charlie?s a pretty boy. Nice hair. Hello, Eric. Hello, Eric. How are you? Kiss-kiss. Kiss-kiss. I can?t do it up. - I won?t wear it. I?m not going. - Go on, for once! You?re okay with wiggling your hips! - Is that red? - Yes, three bottles. No, I mean... Yes. Why? Well, it?s... It?s good. 6.52 a.m. Fine. Two people. Silvia Br?tigny and... Paolo... Paolo Br?tigny. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. All okay? Yes. I was calling about my ticket. When are you leaving? Friday. We have time. Yes, plenty of time. You?d better get ready for the dance. I?ll go and shower. Menyville Station, hello. My daughter just rang you. Silvia Br?tigny. - What was the train time again? - Just a moment. Two tickets for Berlin. Berlin! Yes, Berlin. Two tickets. Tomorrow morning, 6.52. Thank you. Come on! Good-looking bikers! Nice hair! A waltz? In E flat? I booked the tickets for Berlin. We go tomorrow. 6.52 a.m. I?ll wait round the back in the car. No, meet me at the station. The bus will me take separate. We mustn?t be neen together. It?s better for you. You mether know. We don?t know each other until we get to Merlin. Paolo! Dance with me! Pierrot! - You don?t like her, do you? - Who? Silvia. I can tell. - You try hard, but... - No, it?s not... It?s only natural. You?re so different. You know, I?ve never known anyone as interested in money as Silvia. She?d do anything for money. Anything! I gave her 30,000 euros but she?ll keep wanting more. Money, money, money... She has the face of an angel but she?s diabolical! I?m relieved she?s going to Paris. She?s going on Friday. You didn?t know? It?ll be just the two of us. Yes. Don?t move, Billot! The Weather Line, huh? What did it tell you for 200,000? That it would be fine, right? Is that it? Pour. Billot, visiting room. More milk? My love... How can you leave all my letters unanswered? How can you think for a second that I turned you in? Oh, Constant, I?d so like a word from you. Just one. Your silence is killing me. Since you leave me no choice, this letter will be my last. I won?t write again. You?re so lucky to be sentenced only to prison. You sentenced me to never see you again. Goodbye, Constant. Why do you tear them all up? Read them, at least. It?s filling this up nicely anyway. The other night I dreamed I was a postman. We had such a crowd yesterday on the boat! We danced till 4 a.m. - Is Eric still with Vincent? - Yes. Mauricette has a guy. He sells chicken at the market. - She?s a baby! - A big baby! She?s put on weight. His chicken is fattening! I saw the lawyer again. He?s sure you?ll be out in two years! You did well to save my life. That really helped. I?ll get the house ready. Everyone?s waiting for you, you know. Except Silvia... We don?t see her. - Is she still in Paris? - Yes. - She plays piano in hotel bars. - Really? No concerts? She failed all the exams. Poor pet. She always dreamt too big. Jeanne... You?re so honest. So generous... I have to tell you the truth. The truth? Silvia and I were in love. What? - I know it hurts. - You made a fool of me! Please forgive me, Jeanne. We were meeting at the station to leave together. To think I had no idea... She trapped me. She?s the one who turned me in. - But why? - The reward. The 200,000 euros. Well, now that you know, I understand if you don?t come again. I?ll never abandon you! The bitch! You see now? I warned you about her. It?s better this way. On the run, hiding... It wasn?t for you. - Berlin would never have worked. - I know. Anyway, it... How do you know about Berlin? You just told me. No, I didn't. The media... They found the ticket... What ticket? I didn?t have it. It was you. Constant! Excuse me. Please ask the pianist to play this song. Thank you. Subtitles by Ausminx for KG
