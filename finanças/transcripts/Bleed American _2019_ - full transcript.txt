Yeah, I remember we got you home gave you six o'clock feeding, got to your bed at dawn. Then we must have gone to your room a dozen times the next hour to see how you were. Of course, we were quiet, we wanted to see if you were dead. And if you cried, we wanted to see what's wrong with you. I remember lying awake that night, thinking to myself, Now, "What have we got into here?" We were two perfectly happy people. Freeze the air. Now we're trapped, trapped by 20 inches of... Get in the house, I'm going to Jimmy's, I'll be back in a few, all right? Don't come back until you have a job. Clean the hose, all right? Well, I cleaned the house yesterday! Larson?

I remember the day you were born, and I was so happy, because I knew that everything would be all right now that I had a little boy. That makes me so happy. I just... Not like it used to, 'cause you're grown up now, and you're gonna find a girl, and, you know... - Mom come on, come on. - You're gonna leave me. No. I'm not gonna leave you, mom. Do you love me?

Any thoughts on this? Your mother is very sick, kids. I can't hide that from you. Maybe it's best you come live with me for a while. You cut your hair? Playing any new sports or anything?

No, I can walk or something. I won't go in. I can stay in the car. We can talk. So he just left? Yeah. Told him I could take care of you and Lex myself. I'm sure that he'll be around and all that, but he doesn't need to be up in our business and shit. What? You smoking? Nobody cares what I do, man. - Maybe God does. - No, he definitely doesn't. As long as you're all for that, like, forgiveness and bullshit, you'll be fine. - You sound like Gramps. - He brought it up. So what's going on with this Casey Hannon girl. You fucking talking to her? No, just once. Stay away from her, LJ, she isn't good. We're just texting, that's it. That's not what Mark says. What does Mark know? He's hardly ever around. Because Casey's friends with Jodie, and Jodie's dating Mark, so. Just stay away from them. - Guys! - Shut the hell up, Seth! Hey man, have you ever just, like, thought about, like, quitting everything? Like, leaving? Just... Just basically, I mean, ending, like... Forget it. Usually when I feel that way, I just smoke or drink or fuck or something. Speaking of, Have you talked to LJ lately? About what? He's 100% hitting on Casey Hannon. He just said that they're texting and everything. I don't know. Chick's kind of a slut, dude. And LJ's fucking 16. So? Maybe he's ready to become a man. Shut the fuck up. Don't shoot the messenger. They all say she's got the herp. All right, let's stop talking about this, man. I mean, I don't wanna hear that. Hey, only if you say you're going to Sean's. I don't like going to Sean's, man. Why?

It's okay, come on up. Come on. Hey, you won't find Mark here. Him and Jodie are MIA. You could have told me that downstairs. I wouldn't have had to come up. It's okay, It's all good. I gotta go do something real quick. You good hanging out here? This is, um, your brother's place? Yeah, I don't know. He never listens to me. I know you are not putting on makeup just 'cause he's here, girl. Wait, who's here? - Larson. - No! Is he that boy you had tried to fuck in a van? We tried fucking once and he was limp dick. I'm not going back. Wait, what happened? Our girl couldn't get him off. - That's not entirely true. - That's fucked. You know what? It's whatever. He has a thing for Jodie, anyways. What makes you say that? Isn't it obvious? He's always hanging out with Mark, and Mark is a lame ass. Oh, yeah. You ever try getting a guy off and he just fucking lays there? Yeah. Like, show some enjoyment, asshole. I'm putting in the work, give me something back. No, wait. I think it's weird when they lay there making all their noises and moaning and shit. That's probably because he's faking for you. No! guys don't do that shit. Yes they do. I was in the back of a rental car with Paul and- - I don't wanna hear this, no! It was my first time, and I didn't know what I was doing. I'll admit that shit. Wait, what do you mean? I was, like, playing Pac-Man. You were not that bad. It was my first time, okay? Anyways, so he's just, like, straight-up staring at the clock the whole time, and finally he let's out this groan and pushes me away. - Nasty. - What'd you do with the mess? It was dark, I couldn't see shit. I still can't believe you getting engaged, bro. And why do I gotta keep explaining this to retards? Bro you know how much pussy you're gonna miss out on? Nah, you gotta twisted. See, while you're trying to run around, get your dicks wet, I'm gonna have an unlimited supply of pussy. - From one person. - Yeah. Same bitch. Yo, yo, what are you doing up in my house, man? I'm friends with Maddie. Oh, you're friends with my sister, okay. So you're here to my sister, that's what it is? No. Why are you smiling, man? No, we're we're just friends. Okay, how about I come over to your house and your sister? My sister's 13. Okay, you got a bedroom? - You got your own bedroom? - No. 10 by 10, 10 by 12, about 120 square feet? - No. - No, no? I don't have a bedroom. Okay. It's okay. You don't have a bedroom. So you don't be accounting for the bassinet in your house? You know what that is? It goes next to the bed so the baby can sleep. So you don't know what that is? You're gonna play stupid on everything, okay. So, I'm gonna tell you right now, you get that bitch pregnant, I promise you she ain't gonna bring a baby up in this house. We're just friends, I promise. It's nothing, like, nothing's going on or anything. We're just... - Fuck, man. - Spit it out. Sometimes I like teasing him. Like, getting him really close but not finishing him. - Little bitch. - That's pretty cold. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I'm an asshole, right? - Oh, yeah. Maybe I should do that to Dino. He won't ever come back if you do. Well, I'm only trying to fuck Dino to make Larson jealous. I knew it, you wanna get back with him. Okay, Okay, he's cute, but like I said, he has a thing for Jodie. Yeah, and she's taken. Hmm, hardly. She probably doesn't even know that he's into her. I highly doubt that. Bet on it, then. You said Sean's gonna have a party here soon. Invite Dino, see how Larson reacts. Fine. But first, you gotta make him jealous with Dino. Yeah, you ave do it tonight. - Tonight? - Mm-hm. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Maddie, hey, what do you guys got going on tonight? Probably just, you know, hanging out. Okay, well, I need you to stick around because I'm ordering pizza, you gotta open the door.

I dated a 13 year old once, pretty mature. You ever see a girl more than once? - What do you mean? - Like, sleeping together. Man, you get a girl to do that, you're golden. Hey, that's what I said. Hey, Lex. Hey. Hey, where did Larson hide that liquor bottle? - Why? - To drink it? - Well, you're a lady. - Call me mature. - You want some? - No. I'm sorry for your loss.
