YOU THINK THIS IS JUST A COINCIDENTAL NOSEDIVE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT GAMETEKK MASS-RELEASED AN EXACT REPLICA OF OUR GAME 16 HOURS AGO? IT'S POSSIBLE, RIGHT? IT'S WITHIN THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY. THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. GO TO APP WORLD. THEY REVIEWED IT. THEY NEVER REVIEWED "LARRY." NOPE. "THIS NEW APP FROM GAMETEKK IS A PREMIERE EXAMPLE "OF A TRULY DELICATE DESIGN AND ANIMATION THAT DEMONSTRATES--" THIS WALRUS LOOKS DEAD INSIDE. GO TO THE BOTTOM.

IF WE DON'T SUE, IT'S BASICALLY LIKE SAYING WE VALUE OUR TIME AT LESS THAN NOTHING. NO, NO, NO. IT'S LIKE PAYING GAMETEKK FOR THE TIME THEY SPENT STEALING OUR IDEA. LAST YEAR, 36 INDEPENDENT APP DEVELOPERS SUED BIG COMPANIES. NONE OF THEM SAW A SINGLE PENNY ON SETTLEMENT. 25 WENT BANKRUPT. YOU READ TOO MANY BLOGS. CNN IS NOT A BLOG.

SHUT UP. SO I WAS EATING MY PRETZEL, AND I LOOKED OVER, AND I SAW THIS GUY ALSO EATING ONE, AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IF I WAS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON, I WOULD GO UP TO HIM AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT HOW AMAZING THE PRETZELS ARE HERE. AND THEN YOU BECAME A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON? WELL, NO, I SAW IT WAS YOU. OH, RIGHT. COME HERE. I, UH--I HEARD ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT MEETING. YEAH.

SO YOU THINK YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR IT. NO! I MEAN, I USE THE INTERNET, AND I HAD A FACEBOOK AND A SECOND FACEBOOK ACCOUNT FOR MY BOLDER ALTER EGO AND A TWITTER ACCOUNT UNDER MY MOM'S NAME, BUT I DON'T KNOW. I JUST REALIZED IT WAS SUCKING MY LIFE AWAY. I MEAN, I FOUND MYSELF 50 PHOTOS DEEP IN SOME STRANGER'S PROFILE, AND I WAS LIKE, "WHAT AM I DOING?" [LAUGHS] PLUS I HAVE, LIKE, 3 ACTUAL FRIENDS, SO I DON'T REALLY NEED A WHOLE VIRTUAL BOOK TO KEEP TRACK OF THEIR LIVES. WHO IS THE BOLDER ALTER EGO? OK, HER NAME IS SOPHIA PISATSKI. MM-HMM. SHE'S A MEXICAN JEW... WOW. AND AN ORPHAN WITH A SMALL CRIMINAL PAST. NEEDY AND UNSTABLE. I MEAN, SHE SOUNDS LIKE MY TYPE. HA! OH, YOU HAVE A TYPE? OH, I DO NOW, AND JUST TO BE FAIR, I IMAGINE SOPHIA TO BE MUCH MORE VOLUPTUOUS THAN YOU. [LAUGHS] OBVIOUSLY. AND WITH AN ACCENT, AND ODDLY I PICTURE HER WEARING GLASSES. WHAT? HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? WELL, YOU KNOW, IF MY FATHER WERE A HANDSOME POLE WHO UNWITTINGLY KNOCKED UP A PROSTITUTE IN CANCUN, I FEEL-- WHOA, WHOA. NO, NO. SOPHIA'S MOTHER IS FROM ACAPULCO, THANK YOU. OH, YES, OF COURSE. OK? AND HALF OF HER FATHER'S FACE WAS DISFIGURED IN THE WAR. BUT, I MEAN, HE USED TO BE JUST HANDSOME, RIGHT, JUST HANDSOME. I GUESS. WHAT WAR? WHAT? WHAT WAR? YOU KNOW... A WAR, THE KIND THAT THEY HAVE. RIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW, HISTORICALLY, THERE HAVEN'T BEEN THAT MANY CONFLICTS THAT INVOLVED POLAND, SO... OK, LOOK, SHE'S NOT A REAL PERSON, SO I DIDN'T FEEL OBLIGATED TO GIVE HER A CREDIBLE BACKSTORY. NO, WELL, MAYBE HE WAS A RELATIVELY YOUNG WORLD WAR II VETERAN, LIKE DIAPER YOUNG, AND HE JUST HAD A VERY HIGH SPERM COUNT. THERE YOU GO. HA HA. IS IT WRONG THAT I WANT ANOTHER PRETZEL RIGHT NOW? NO, I WOULD THINK SIGNIFICANTLY LESS OF YOU IF YOU DIDN'T. OH. UM, WOW, I--I GOTTA GET GOING. OH, UH, WELL, THEN I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU AROUND. YEAH. UH, HEY, UM... YES? YEAH. OK. OK. OK. WHAT? UH, ALL RIGHT. [LAUGHS] ALL RIGHT. OK. [LAUGHS] SOPHIA PISATSKI WOULD ASK YOU FOR YOUR NUMBER SO WE COULD HANG OUT AGAIN, 'CAUSE IT WAS FUN. WELL, I'M GONNA GIVE SOPHIA MUCH MORE THAN MY NUMBER. I REGRET THAT. THAT WAS WEIRD. HONESTLY, I JUST WANT TO FACEBOOK STALK YOU, BUT YOU LIVE IN THE 19th CENTURY, SO I CAN'T DO THAT. I ALREADY HAVE A WILL IN HERE. DO YOU GO BY ANYTHING ELSE? NO, I DO NOT. WILLY? WILLIAM? NO. NOPE. WILLIAM IV? NO. NOT-- YES. NO, THAT'S CLOSE, BUT NEVER. BIG DOUB? NO? BIG DOUB? I LIKE THAT. NO, HOW OFTEN DO YOU TALK TO THIS WILL IN HERE? NEVER. NEVER?

BIDNESS. WHAT? NO, I DON'T-- JUST BUSINESS. JUST BUSINESS! HA. OK, WE TRIED FOR A SETTLEMENT. NOW WE FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT, DEFEND OUR DIGNITY. I'M NOT MUCH OF A DIGNITY GUY, ACTUALLY. MONEY'S GOOD, THOUGH. MONEY, I LIKE. LOOK, MAN, WE ARE GONNA WIN THIS THING, AND THEN GAMETEKK IS GONNA BE PAYING US NOT TO WORK FOR THEM, PAYING US. OR WE BECOME DESTITUTE AND LOSE WHAT LITTLE RESPECT OUR PARENTS MIGHT HAVE MUSTERED FOR OUR SO-CALLED CAREERS. NO, LISTEN, I GOTTA GO, OK? ME AND SOPHIE ARE GONNA CATCH A HIGH-SCHOOL BASEBALL GAME. WHAT? YOU'RE STILL HANGING OUT WITH HER? YEAH, MAN. JUST 'CAUSE SHE'S GOT A BOYFRIEND DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS. IT'S--IT'S THE MODERN ERA, MAN. MEN AND WOMEN CAN DO THESE THINGS. [KNOCK ON DOOR] HI. HI. UM, IS SOPHIE HERE? YEAH. UM, YOU MUST BE WILL. COME IN. UH, YOU ARE... I'M VANESSA. I LIVE HERE, TOO. OK. YEP. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN, LIKE, A BUTLER FOR A SECOND. OH.

I MEAN, I KNOW WHEN I'M CRYING, I DON'T WANT TO SEE OR TALK TO ANYBODY. OK, BUT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE ALONE, LIKE, WHEN I'M ALONE, LIKE, CRYING, LIKE, SOMETIMES ALL I WANT IS A HUG. DO YOU WANT A HUG? YES. WHAT--NO. NO. NO, NO, NO. I'M FINE. I'M FINE. I DON'T NEED A HUG. THESE ARMS ARE MADE FOR HUGGING. THANK YOU. THEY WERE.

BUT JUST TELL HER THAT BOYS SUCK AND SHE'S PRETTY OR SOMETHING. IF I GO OVER AND TELL A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL THAT SHE'S PRETTY, I AM GONNA SPEND THE NIGHT, SEVERAL NIGHTS IN PRISON GETTING RAPED BY SOME LARGE MAN NAMED D-TONE. SO TAKE IT EASY. OK. HI. WHO ARE YOU? UH, LOOK, WE WERE STARING AT YOU... CRYING. LOOK, WE-- I'D OFFER YOU A TISSUE, BUT I HAD A REALLY BIG CRY TODAY MYSELF WATCHING "TOY STORY 3," SO I'M ALL OUT. SORRY. THAT MOVIE IS SO SAD. SHH.

[BOTH IMITATE GUITARS] YEP, ALL RIGHT. SEE YA. SO I HAD A STRANGE DAY AT WORK TODAY. DID YOU GET FIRED? WHY WOULD I HAVE GOTTEN FIRED? I--I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, IT'S STUPID. YOU OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T GET FIRED. NEVER MIND. YEAH, SO, UM, JACKSON ASKED ME TO COME INTO THE OFFICE, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, AND I'M THINKING, YOU KNOW, MORE DOCUMENT REVIEW OR STAY LATE OR WHATEVER. UH, BUT THEN I WALK IN, AND ALL THE PARTNERS ARE IN THERE. KEITH... I MADE PARTNER. WHAT? YEAH. OH, MY GOD. THAT'S AMAZING. WHEN THEY TOLD ME, I WAS JUST LIKE, "DUDE, DO NOT CRY RIGHT NOW."

HEARD ONE OF THE PARTNERS SAY THAT ONCE. EXCUSE ME. YES, SIR? UM, WHICH WOULD YOU RECOMMEND OUT OF THE FILET AND THE RIB EYE? MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS THE RIB EYE... [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] Danny: AND THAT'S WHY I DON'T FUCK WITH GIRLS WITH BOYFRIENDS. I SEE A TIDAL WAVE OF WISDOM FAR OFF IN THE DISTANCE. OK, FIRST OF ALL, PLEASE DON'T DISMISS WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY JUST BECAUSE I HAVE AN ACTIVE SEX LIFE WITH A VARIED ASSORTMENT OF STRANGE WOMEN. AFFORD ME THAT SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. I CAN DO THAT. AND SECOND OF ALL, PLEASE REMOVE THOSE DIRTY-ASS SHOES AND SOCKS FROM MY COUCH. THIS AIN'T YOUR HOME. HAVE SOME RESPECT, BOY. OK. CHRIST. HERE COMES SOME WISDOM. GIRLS WITH BOYFRIENDS... ARE THE WORST. THAT SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL LOT OF SETUP FOR A VERY SIMPLE DECLARATION. OK, THAT WAS JUST MY THESIS STATEMENT. NOW HEAR MY SUPPORTING ARGUMENT. GOD, YOU SPENT WAY TOO MUCH TIME AT PRIVATE SCHOOLS. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I DID, ALL RIGHT? GIRLS WITH BOYFRIENDS ARE LIKE A... FUCKING SCURVY, OK, NEW TO OUR GENERATION IN MANY WAYS. I MEAN, WHEN YOU AND I WERE COMING UP, THERE WAS A TIME WHERE A WOMAN WOULD MEET A MAN, SHE WOULD MARRY THAT MAN, AND THEN SHE WOULD DIVORCE THAT MAN. GREAT AMERICAN TRADITION. EXACTLY, BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, SOMEBODY GAVE THESE BITCHES IDEAS AND THOUGHTS AND MEMORIES, AND THEY'RE JUST CRIPPLED BY THE FEAR OF REPEATING AN UNHAPPY PAST. JESUS, THAT'S BLEAK. YEAH, THAT'S WHY I DON'T SUBSCRIBE. I DON'T SUBSCRIBE TO THAT SHIT, MAN. I CAN'T. SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME, IF I HAVE THIS RIGHT, IS THAT SOPHIE IS DELIBERATELY TOYING WITH ME TO FULFILL SOME SORT OF PERCEIVED EVOLUTIONARY NEED. IS THAT RIGHT? ENH! WRONG. THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING. WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU'RE FUCKING YOURSELF IF YOU'RE GETTING TO KNOW A WOMAN WHO YOU AIN'T FUCKING. WHY DO I KEEP GOING TO YOU FOR ADVICE? ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO GET OFF YOUR CHEST? YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN PICK UP YOUR CHECK ON FRIDAY THEN. JESUS CHRIST. HOLY SHIT, DUDE. DID YOU JUST FIRE SOMEONE? [SIGHS] YEAH. I AM ODDLY EXCITED RIGHT NOW. CAN WE--CAN WE JUST GET BACK TO THE GAMETEKK SITUATION? YES. SORRY. SO, LOOK, THEY SENT OVER AN ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT LAST NIGHT. IT'S NOT GREAT. BASICALLY THEY SAID THAT THEY'LL SEE US IN COURT. BUT THAT'S NOT-- I MEAN, WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT. WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE UP. I MEAN, MONEY DOESN'T MATTER. MONEY DOES MATTER. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING-- THEY'VE SUCKED THE SOUL OUT OF LARRY AND STUCK HIM IN THE BODY OF JABBA THE HUTT WITH TUSKS. MONEY DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT IF THEY DIDN'T, MAN? WHAT IF-- LOOK, CAN WE JUST-- CAN WE JUST-- I DON'T KNOW-- STALL THEM FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS WHILE WE FIGURE THIS OUT? YEAH. SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM. OK. THANKS. ALL RIGHT, WE REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE IT. DO THEY EVER CRY WHEN YOU FIRE THEM? Will: WHY ARE WE EVEN GOING TO THIS THING? I KNOW THAT KEITH HAS BEEN MADE ALMIGHTY PARTNER, BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE OUR CASE ANY LESS FUCKED. OK, BUT HE IS STILL OUR FRIEND, AND THIS IS HIS PARTY. YOU KNOW THIS GAMETEKK STUFF ISN'T HIS FAULT, RIGHT? WHATEVER. DUDE, SERIOUSLY, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? NOTHING. NOTHING IS MY PROBLEM. MM-HMM. WOULD SOPHIE HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT MAYBE? THE OTHER NIGHT, I SAW THEM KISSING. AND IT JUST MADE ME FEEL SO SICK. AND I CAN'T GET OVER IT. ALL RIGHT, WELL, I--I'VE ACTUALLY HAD THIS CONVERSATION PRETTY REGULARLY IN MY HEAD FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS, SO I AM PREPARED. FIRST QUESTION. IS THIS SERIOUS? YES. SECOND QUESTION. HAVE YOU HAD SEX WITH HER YET? OF COURSE NOT! OK. ALL RIGHT. NO! GOD, I WOULDN'T DO THAT, MAN. THIRD QUESTION. ARE YOU WILLING TO GIVE HER AN ULTIMATUM? NO. NO. WELL, DUDE, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OPTIONS THEN, SO YOU GOTTA MOVE ON. WELL, I COULD WAIT FOR THEM TO BREAK UP, YOU KNOW. MARRIAGE IS MORE LIKELY AT THIS POINT THAN A BREAKUP. YEAH. DUDE, YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT PLAYING SECOND FIDDLE. THAT IS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF, OK? SECOND FIDDLERS ARE BITCHES. ALL FIDDLERS ARE BITCHES. GRANDFATHER WAS KILLED BY A FIDDLER. MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, MAN. I MEAN, SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. YES. WHAT AM I DOING? WE ARE LITERALLY ON OUR WAY TO A PARTY SHE IS THROWING FOR HER RICH, HANDSOME BOYFRIEND. AND, LOOK, I KNOW-- I KNOW IT'S BEEN AFFECTING MY WORK, MAN, OK? AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. I'M BACK ON TEAM LARRY, ALL RIGHT? I'M DONE BEING THE BOYFRIEND TO MY LAWYER'S GIRLFRIEND. GOD, WHEN YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD, IT SOUNDS SO FUCKED UP. HEH. TO TEAM LARRY? TO TEAM LARRY. [MUSIC PLAYING] IT'S A CUTE SIGN. KEITH HATES IT. I NEVER SAID I HATED IT. IT'S A SHITTY SIGN. IT'S TERRIBLE. I MEAN, IF YOU LOOK AT IT TWICE, I MEAN, I SEE IT NOW. I TOTALLY GET IT. THANKS. HEY, UH, WHERE'S WILL? HE HAD A LONG WEEK, SO HE WENT STRAIGHT FOR THE ALCOHOL TABLE. YEAH.

YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY SIT ON IT. I'M PRETTY SURE THAT SOMEBODY GAVE BIRTH ON THAT BEAUTIFUL CLOUD. YOU CAN SEE THE STAINS. OK, THAT'S NOT TRUE. WE FOUND THAT COUCH IN RESEDA. OK. IT'S RESEDA. I DON'T... HEY... HMM? DO YOU WANNA GO OUT SOMETIME? WOW. THAT WINE WENT TO YOUR HEAD PRETTY QUICKLY. HEH. YEAH. I'D LOVE TO. GREAT. THAT'S GREAT. [LAUGHS] BOTTOMS UP. ALL RIGHT. UH-HUH. [LAUGHS] MM. HELLO. OH! SORRY. SORRY. IT'S FINE. IT'S NOT LIKE RED WINE STAINS OR ANYTHING. THAT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM IF YOU'D BOUGHT A DECENT CHARDONNAY FOR YOUR BOYFRIEND'S PARTY. [LAUGHS] WHAT? IT'S TRUE. HE ASKED ME OUT. MM-HMM. SO... SO... [GROANING] [ROARING] HEY. HEY. I'M HERE TO... OH. YOU LOOK DAPPER. UH, YOU LOOK LIKE THE LADY VERSION OF DAPPER. THANK YOU. UH, HERE.

I DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW THAT WAS A REAL SPORT. YEAH, NO. NOR DID I. HAVE YOU GIVEN UP YET? NO. STOP ASKING ME THAT. IT'S JUST... OVER THE COURSE OF MY DEPRESSION, I HAVE HAD TIME TO THINK, AND I REALIZED SOMETHING, MAN. I REALIZED THAT THERE COMES A TIME IN EVERY MAN'S LIFE WHERE HE MUST ADMIT DEFEAT, GIVE UP ON HIS DREAMS, AND WAVE THE WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER, AND SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? LIFE, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT. "MAYBE I SHOULD GIVE UP. MAYBE I SHOULD QUIT." FOR US, THAT TIME IS NOW, MY FRIEND. FOR US, THAT TIME IS SOMEWHERE AROUND LAST TUESDAY. [CELLPHONE CHIMES] [CELLPHONE CHIMES] SO IN SEATTLE, A JUDGE RECENTLY RULED IN FAVOR OF A COUPLE DEVELOPERS WHO CLAIMED THAT THEIR I.P. WAS INFRINGED UPON BY A CORPORATION. THOSE GUYS WERE ABLE TO CONVINCE THE JUDGE BASED ON A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF BOTH GAMES. A PRECEDENT HAS BEEN SET. BUT IT DOESN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING, AND I'M STILL, YOU KNOW, NOT SURE IT'LL BE WORTH IT FOR YOU GUYS TO PROCEED. IT'LL BE WORTH IT.

WHAT ARE THE ODDS THIS IS ACTUALLY GONNA LAND ON SOMEBODY? NO, I MEAN FOR THE COUCH. IT'S OLD. IT CAN'T SURVIVE A 2-STORY PLUNGE. YOU REALIZE THAT WE'RE TAKING THIS TO THE GARBAGE, RIGHT? NO, WE'RE TAKING IT TO THE CURB SO SOMEBODY CAN GIVE IT A GOOD HOME. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANNA DO THIS? I'M NOT SURE THE "IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING, SET IT FREE" MANTRA APPLIES TO COUCHES. WELL, KEITH HAS BEEN DYING TO BUY ME A NEW COUCH, AND HE SAID HE'S GONNA HAVE THE DELIVERY PEOPLE DISPOSE OF IT WHEN THEY BRING THE NEW ONE, BUT IT JUST SOUNDS SO COLD, YOU KNOW. DEFINITELY. I MEAN, YOU GOTTA GIVE YOUR GARBAGE COUCH THE PROPER SEND-OFF. [BOTH GRUNT] ARE YOU SURE YOU GOT THIS? YEP, I'M GOOD. OK, THIS IS REALLY HEAVY. YEAH, WELL, IT'S A COUCH, SO COUCHES ARE HEAVY...

I MEAN, THAT'S-- YOU KNOW, THAT'S... ARE YOU OK? YEAH. IT'S JUST... I'VE HAD THIS COUCH FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. YOU KNOW, I FOUND IT ON THE STREET, AND I TOOK IT IN, AND I CLEANED IT, AND I TOOK CARE OF IT, AND JUST THE THOUGHT OF IT ENDING UP AT SOME DUMP, GETTING PICKED APART BY SEAGULLS OR PIGEONS-- I MEAN, I KNOW THAT THIS SOUNDS COMPLETELY CRAZY, BUT-- NO. I MEAN, IT'S-- IT'S SO NORMAL. IT'S MY COUCH. WE'VE JUST... WE'VE BEEN THROUGH EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW? YEAH. HEY, IT'S OK. IT'S OK. [CRYING] [SIREN PASSING] IT'S--COME ON. SHH. Will: HEY, SOPHIE. YEAH?

WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER. THERE IS NO DELIVERY GUY. WHAT, SO THEY'RE NOT BRINGING OVER A COUCH? NO, THEY ARE. THEY, UM, ARE JUST TAKING IT TO MY NEW PLACE... WITH THE REST OF MY FURNITURE. SO, YOUR--YOUR LEASE IS UP SOON, SO I FIGURED... I WANT YOU TO MOVE IN WITH ME. I'M GONNA-- I'M GONNA GO. YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA, MAN. WHY IS IT A GOOD IDEA? WHY IS THAT? IS IT 'CAUSE YOU WERE TOO BUSY TO HELP YOUR GIRLFRIEND MOVE AND I DID? IS THAT... YEAH, I DON'T NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF MY GIRLFRIEND. LOOK, HE WASN'T DOING ANYTHING. AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY I'M SO BUSY? NO. IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR FUCKING RETARDED RABBIT CASE. I WAS OUT LATE LAST NIGHT GETTING ERIC DRUNK ON YOUR BEHALF. WELL, YOU KNOW, DON'T DO ME ANY FAVORS. I BEEN DOING YOU ONE HUGE-ASS FAVOR FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS. MAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN RETURN? YOU'RE TRYING TO MOVE IN ON MY GIRLFRIEND? WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT ALL. NO, MAN, I WAS HERE TO HELP HER MOVE A COUCH, OK? THAT'S IT. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A DICK ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT? YEAH, I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY CLEARLY THE DICK IN THIS SITUATION. NOBODY IS A DICK. CAN WE PLEASE JUST CALM DOWN? PLEASE? YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST GONNA HEAD OUT OF HERE. I THINK I'VE GOT A RETARDED RABBIT AT HOME THAT I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF. YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE A GREAT NIGHT. [GRUNTING] [SNAKE HISSES] [DOOR OPENS] ANOTHER SATURDAY-MORNING IRONING SESSION? HOW'D IT GO WITH SOPHIE? YOU'RE BURNING YOUR SHIRT. I GOT A TEXT FROM KEITH. WE CAN GET ANOTHER LAWYER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DESIGN LARRY A HAT. NOT WITH LARRY. WITH KEITH'S GIRLFRIEND. SHE JUST NEEDED HELP WITH SOMETHING, OK, SO I--I HELPED HER. WHY? WHY DID YOU HELP HER INSTEAD OF HAVING SEX WITH HER HOT ROOMMATE? OR EVEN HAVING SEX WITH ANYONE, REALLY. EVEN IF YOU HAD SEX WITH HER ON A RATTY TRASH COUCH, WHICH I WOULD FEEL A LITTLE BIT BETTER, BECAUSE AT LEAST THEN I WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WERE DOING THIS, BUT YOU DIDN'T, DID YOU? THAT COUCH IS DISGUSTING. I'M SORRY. WHAT WAS THAT? EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND. I JUST GOTTA PULL THIS KNIFE OUT OF MY BACK. YOU KNOW, IF--IF ANYONE SHOULD FEEL BETRAYED, IT'S KEITH. AH, WELL, KEITH'S ENTIRE CAREER DIDN'T REALLY DEPEND ON THIS LAWSUIT, THOUGH, DID IT? I HOPE THAT, AT THE VERY LEAST, AT THE VERY LEAST, IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT DETRIMENTAL TO HIM. YEAH? YEAH, OK, THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S FANTASTIC. WHAT ABOUT US? HMM? WHAT-- WHAT ABOUT ME? KEITH HAD A FUCKING AMAZING MEETING LAST NIGHT WITH ERIC. I MEAN, IT WAS LITERALLY OUR ONLY CHANCE IN THIS POINTLESS LAWSUIT, AND YOU WOULD KNOW THAT IF YOU ACTUALLY PICKED UP HIS CALLS ONCE IN A WHILE, BUT WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? OH, RIGHT. "RING-RING. HEY, KEITH. "WHAT'S GOING ON? NO, I'M--I'M JUST WASHING YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S FEET RIGHT NOW." YOU KNOW WHAT? FUCK YOU, MAN! FUCK YOU, OK? FOR MONTHS, YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING DECISIONS FOR BOTH OF US. AND I WAS WITH YOU BECAUSE WE'RE A TEAM, BUT NOW YOU JUST-- NOW YOU JUST CHANGE YOUR MIND WITHOUT EVEN CONSIDERING HOW IT AFFECTS ME. YOU KNOW, MAYBE I WANTED TO TAKE THAT JOB AT GAMETEKK, BUT YOU NEVER EVEN ASKED. OK. OK, MAN, IS THIS OVER? IS THIS-- YOU KNOW WHY "PROUD LARRY" IS SUCH A SHITTY GAME, HUH? IT'S BECAUSE LARRY IS A STUBBORN FUCKING ASSHOLE! IF WALLY THE WALRUS WALKS INTO A LAND MINE, HE ADMITS THAT HE'S WRONG. "OH, FUCK. SHIT, I'M EXPLODING. QUICK, I GOTTA USE MY HEALTH POINTS TO HEAL MYSELF." BUT YOU KNOW WHAT LARRY DOES IN THAT SITUATION? LARRY JUST KEEPS LIMPING ALONG LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT UNTIL THE GIANT LADYBUG EATS HIM. NOBODY LIKES A RABBIT WITHOUT HUMILITY, WILL. THAT RABBIT JUST GETS EATEN. ALL RIGHT, WE CAN GET ANOTHER LAWYER. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE LAWYER, YOU FUCKING IDIOT. I THOUGHT WHEN HE ASKED HER TO MOVE IN WITH HIM, YOU'D FINALLY GET IT. HAVE FUN DYING ALONE. [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CLOSES] THERE'S NOT ANY LAWYERS AT THE PARTY, ARE THERE? HEY. HEY. HEY, BANNON, YOU MADE IT. YEAH, I'M AS SURPRISED AS YOU ARE. I GOT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING FROM MY PRIVATE CELLAR. OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. OH, BANNON, THIS IS SOPHIE. SOPHIE, THIS IS BANNON. HEY. I'M THE CRANKY OLD ASSHOLE AT THE OFFICE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD. I MAY HAVE HEARD A THING OR TWO. [LAUGHS] [PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES] THINK THEY PLAYED THIS SONG AT SHAKESPEARE'S FUNERAL. YEAH, USUALLY, YOU KNOW. WE'RE CLASSIC-ROCK TYPES, BUT WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP THINGS STUFFY FOR YOU OLD FOLKS. KEITH IS ACTUALLY AN AIR GUITAR GOD. HE CAN PLAY THE SOLO TO "PARADISE CITY" WITH HIS EYES CLOSED. AIR GUITAR? IS THAT RIGHT, KEITH? NO, SHE'S KIDDING. SHE'S KIDDING. HEY, CAN YOU BELIEVE YOUR MAN HERE? PARTNER FOR WHAT, LIKE A MONTH, AND ALREADY THE HEAD HONCHO'S SENDING HIM TO HONG KONG FOR THE SUMMER. HONG KONG? HEY, UH, BANNY, FOLLOW ME. I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO THE LIQUOR CABINET. OH, WE'VE MET. HEY. HEY. GOOD TO SEE YOU OUT OF THE OFFICE FOR ONCE. FOLKS. [PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES] YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WENT WELL. DON'T YOU THINK THAT WENT WELL? YEAH, IT DID. YOU KNOW, I LIKE THOSE GUYS. AND I FEEL LIKE THAT'S RARE AT A FIRM LIKE MINE. YOU KNOW, HONG KONG'S NOT OFFICIAL YET. AND I CAN TURN IT DOWN. YOU JUST MADE PARTNER. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME? THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. YEAH. THINK ABOUT IT. [PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES] [SIGHS] [PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES] UH, ERIC? AH, WILL, GRAB A SEAT. HEY, SO IT'S--IT'S NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU. IF YOU'RE HERE TO BEG FOR MERCY, YOU SHOULD START NOW. I'M NOT... LOOK, I'M NOT HERE TO BEG. WELL, THEN WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR? UM... I CAME BY TO... LET YOU KNOW THAT, UM... I'M GONNA DROP THE SUIT. WHEW. [LAUGHS] WHAT A LOAD OFF. MAN, I MEAN, WE ARE-- I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO, UH, SLAUGHTERING YOU GUYS IN COURT, BUT THIS IS MUCH NICER. I LIKE-- YEAH, I APPRECIATE THAT. OK, WELL, ALSO, UM, I WANTED TO COME BY IN PERSON TO, UH, TALK TO YOU ABOUT MY BUSINESS PARTNER HARPER. YEAH, YOU GUYS MADE AN OFFER TO HIM EARLIER, AND I REALLY THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT HIS WORK, SOME OF HIS OTHER WORK AND RECONSIDER. I THINK HE'D BE A REALLY-- A GREAT FIT FOR YOU GUYS. IT WAS FUCKED UP WHAT YOU DID TO KEITH. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? EXCUSE ME? YOU TWO WERE FRIENDS, WEREN'T YOU? UM... LOOK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT ANY OF THAT HAS TO DO W-WITH US OR WITH THIS RIGHT NOW. YOU DON'T JUST FIRE SOMEONE FROM A JOB BECAUSE YOU HAVE A BONER FOR THEIR GIRL. I--I MEAN... UM... OK, I UNDERSTAND THAT, AND, YES, YOU'RE RIGHT. AND, UH, YOU KNOW... WE'VE ALL GOT GROWING TO DO, OBVIOUSLY, UM, BUT, LOOK, THE REASON I CAME BY WAS FOR MY BUSINESS PARTNER HARPER, AND IF YOU COULD JUST-- IF YOU GUYS COULD JUST, YOU KNOW, TAKE A-- TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING, WHAT HE'S BEEN WORKING ON, I THINK, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA BE REALLY IMPRESSED. PLEASE. HEY, KEITH. UH, ONE SEC. I'M JUST GONNA HEAD TO WORK. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO WORK. OH. UM, WELL, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA START PACKING FOR HONG KONG TODAY. WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY HOME? BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO TO MY JOB. [LAUGHS] COME ON. IT'S NOT EVEN A REAL JOB. NO. RIGHT, IT'S A FAKE JOB. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. YOU'RE QUITTING IN 2 WEEKS, SO WHY NOT JUST BLOW IT OFF? KEITH, I CAN'T JUST BLOW IT OFF. LIKE, I LIKE MY JOB. I MEAN, I HATE WHEN YOU ASSUME THAT THE THINGS THAT I DO JUST DON'T MATTER AT ALL. LOOK, I'M SURE THERE'LL BE ANOTHER TRENDY COFFEE SHOP IN HONG KONG, OK? OK, THAT'S NOT THE POINT. I MEAN, OK, WHAT IF I WANTED TO FINISH MY MASTER'S? THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE IT 2 YEARS AGO WHEN YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GRADUATE. HEH. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. LOOK, I'M JUST-- I'M STRESSED OUT, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? OH, MY GOD, NOTHING. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. I'M JUST... YOU KNOW, I HAVE THINGS HERE, FRIENDS, A JOB. WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT? NOTHING. NOTHING. CAN WE JUST-- CAN WE JUST STOP FIGHTING? YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA BE LATE FOR WORK. GLADLY. LOOK, JUST CALL ME ON YOUR WAY HOME. ALL RIGHT? WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT HONG KONG? WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST ASK ME? I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS WITH YOU RIGHT NOW. ALL RIGHT, THEN MAYBE WE JUST SHOULDN'T DO THIS. WHO IS IT? HI. HOW DID YOU FIND WHERE I LIVE? UM, I WORK FOR THE INTERNET, SO IT-- IT WASN'T HARD. STALKER. YEAH. IT'S FINE, SHANNON. Shannon: AHEM. HI. HI. I TOOK THE JOB. OH, YEAH? OH, THAT'S GREAT, MAN. OH, I'M-- THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S REALLY GREAT. THAT BLUBBERY FUCK SURE MAKES FOR AN EXCITING GAME, HUH? HE'S NO LARRY. [CELLPHONE CHIMES] [CELLPHONE CHIMES] UH... RIGHT. YEAH. I SHOULD, UH... GO AHEAD. IT'S FINE. UM...
