Well. And they wondered in their youth to baptism. Somehow, you know, put mirrors in a special way looked at them through the candles, made a thought on narrowed. Grandma saw once stairs so high with carpet and her legs go down in varnish plugs. It was fashionable then. AND the man himself is not visible, but the face is about to appear, and here she says: "I got scared, dropped the candles and ran out of the room. " I say, "Grandma, well, you stupid, ran out. I would have seen a betrothed. " She says how narrowed she’s to the devil, it became scary, to the point of horror. Already leaving? Will you wake up or call you? And they will wake me up. Who will wake you up? One reliable friend. What kind of reliable friend is this? Do you know how angry I am? Well, what else can be a comrade, well, of course, an alarm clock. Well, here you go. Well, go away, well ... Go. Do you hear? Go on. Go. Go! Go away Go away, go away, go away! All-all, drive carefully. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Ale. Albinka, ay, are you alone? Yes. Then come up to us. we have such people. Valyunchik, I'm already sleeping. You wake up and come. Wait. Olga! Are you fooling around there, huh? Sasha, listen, I have no mood to have fun. We will organize the mood and in general, the composition is announced, failures are not accepted. Wait a minute. Hello my good so do you rise Valyushka, I’m already all washed up and ... It suits you very much, everyone is terribly hungry to see you. Well, who is it, everyone? Extremely wonderful people, you don’t know them. Lariska is already coming down. Here is a terrific option for her, by the way, just got divorced, do you understand? Got it, got it. We wait. Do you have vanillin? For cream it is necessary, Valyushka bakes a cake. I don’t know, I’ll look now. Personally, I'm for a minute I have a very hard day tomorrow. In the morning you have to go to the bank. Listen, earring is something mine stuck up completely, sneezing something, coughing. It can be seen that they have drafts in the garden there. Yeah. What kind of people are there? They say they are exceptionally wonderful. Yes? And I'm not combed. Can? AND! I'm coming! Hey. Hey. What kind of holiday? Brought? We are from the game ours lost, but the game was cool. Here we are! Come on, to the kitchen quickly, for the pie. Well, alright ... Come on, come on, come on, run. So it is. To our left, which is very beautiful, girl Olya. Hello. To our right, who is also very beautiful, is the girl Larisa. Pavlovna. Guest from the capital. Studied together. Herbert's name. Herbert, by the way, traveled the whole world. And in what city are you now You work in Switzerland, Herbert, I forgot. I AM? Oh, thanks for the coffee. Well, to be precise, at the moment in no way. Well, that's okay. Today here, tomorrow in Geneva. Your work is like that. So, Gerber Martynovich we have a diplomat. So? Well, and you, Sasha. What? What, why aren't you a diplomat, I ask You studied at the same institute. A little bit. Because Sasha went to big sport. You see, girls In the field of higher education big surprises. The three of us really studied together, in the canteen in the electrotechnical cracked sausages, I hope you remember Hera. But Hera is now a Muscovite, a resident of the capital, represents domestic equipment abroad. Sashka with electronic speed rushing for the puck across the field, Well, I'm counting on electronic technology public opinion about their activities. Well said? Well, Venia, Benjamin! Scientific person. We are sitting well. It’s great when people talk, guys. Awful sometimes refute, affirm. You know, we argue so rarely, and that’s a pity. Sorry. Valya, I urge you to argue. Come on, let's argue. Valya. I agree. Unless it bothers you, that I am Larisa. Larisa? And this is wonderful! It's fine! It’s only a pity that we are going so We speak on general topics and disagree. We disagree, but this is a pity. Because there’s something to talk about, well, Yurka, okay, he’s there according to his travels abroad, so from our customs alas, weaned. But to us life is not without crying in a vest. And especially to women. Do you feel sorry for women, right? Probably especially single. Well? And we have become smarter for a long time, women. We realized that it’s easier to live, when there is nobody to whine and cry as you say, in a vest. And there’s nobody to hope for except for yourself. Well, you know how it is, Larisa, the women understood. What? Simple human happiness? Home, family? Well, so, I am the family. Me and my baby. Well, thank God, I live the third year alone. And I do not regret it. I just now realized what real happiness is. And I won’t exchange it for any carriages. Yes. And climb into the loop of marriage again. Don’t argue with Lariska, her men are where she is. She gives them a salary at her motor depot. I don’t care like that we are so sitting we argue. But for some reason Olya is silent. Beautiful, sad Olya. She also chopped off her and now a beautiful, free woman. Mistress herself right ol? Please put it on the table. I do not know. I don’t know if it’s better when the mistress herself, it’s good, and when freedom. Probably, after all, you need someone to cry. Are you stunned or something? Venya, disgusting. Because family probably, as a homeland, it should be, and that's it here, otherwise it makes no sense at all. Gold words. need a drink. A drink, they say, is not supposed to. Sasha! I’ll sit on the bench. You have the same regime. There's nothing! (Scream) Nothing, comrades, it happens. This happens. We rehearse this future happy family life. One minute. I have to go too. True, it's time. Goodbye. I'm listening to. How did you get there? Sorry, young man, you obviously got the wrong number. I report I'm going to sleep, I set an alarm. Good night. Hey chipmunk beast! Get up! Antoshka, dear, get up, honey, get up. Come on, get on. Go Go go! Get on quick! If faster, then back to front. Nothing, when you are late, you can back and forth. Oh, Earring, hello. Where's mom? Yes, here I am, hear here? In the elevator mom. To not leave. Come quickly. Vasya will bring us along the road to the motor depot. Come on, come on, quick, come out. My ex called they have puffy coats, they brought Finnish, do you need? Yes, and what color? Dark? Inflated. Oh, well, what, quarreled again? Well, what are you back, I apologized. Like he's some kind of crazy. From a fool. Well, what a fool you are, Valyusha, by golly. And also a teacher, as we trust our children to you. Fulling mill, don't you need a puffed finnish coat? What color? Yes inflated. Come on, Sasha will bring me from Czechoslovakia. Come on, go down. Watch out. God bless you, Vasechka. I won’t be lost. In kindergarten first, or what? As always, my darling, as always. Vasya, let's go. On your blow. (sing) (sing) Good morning. Valya, get married. You at least remember my name, before making me an offer. My name is Olga. Let's step aside? In you one minute. I understand that everything looks ridiculous. Not at all with this I wanted to start. You see, Olya, I have never been married, so I survived until 36 years old falling in love all his life he dreamed of a family. And yesterday you said so unexpectedly and so not for today. Do you remember? What is bad to be alone? No, this is ... Anyone is feeling bad. Well family is like homeland just got to be and that’s it, the rest is not important. I wonder if it’s not even important whether I love let's say you? Yes. But we don’t choose our homeland in advance, we are just born first then we learn to love and appreciate her, and as they say, a duty to fulfill. And in the beginning we just get it. You still don’t love anyone. So what am I worse than others? Also, I understand you better than rest. It even seems to me that I have known you for a long time. And that was at your place, even lived. So would you like to settle with me? Well, unless, of course, you agree. I don’t have my own apartment. I'm with my mother I live. I’m writing a candidate. That's how you are, let's live? Together? But not this morning? And you probably have to go to work. I already said three times as much released. Everything will work out for you. I wish you happiness. Olya! But if my words do not seem to you complete nonsense, and if you ever become very bad, you remember how I told you, "Olya, let's live together. " And you call me and say yes, just "да". Good luck. Hello, Kirill Ivanovich. Everything, I guess, dating, parting. Promises, huh? Washing, cooking, Kirill Ivanovich, reading fiction.
