(wind whistling) (upbeat funky music) * That's a promise * Bet you won't put your trust in me * Bet you won't let me go further than you can see * Bet you think I planned something and won't say * If you think I'm thinking of a slicker way * That's a promise * I'm gonna get ya * That's a promise * I'm gonna blow your mind * That's a promise * I'm gonna get ya * That's a promise * I'm gonna blow your mind * How many times have I shook your hand * And how many times have you walked away * Saying I'm your man * Count the times you've made me cry * If you think I'm gonna keep crying until the day I die * That's a promise * I'm gonna get ya * That's a promise * I'm gonna blow your mind * That's a promise * I'm gonna get ya * That's a promise * I'm gonna blow your mind (Charley laughing) - I didn't think you could keep up with me, Speed. - I'm serious, my man, I've done a lot of running the streets in my time. - It's all right. Listen, I'll see you at the dojo, okay? - Solid, bye bye. - There you go. * That's a promise * I'm gonna blow your mind (door creaking) (Charley sighs) - [Narrator] In large US cities, millions of people live a life of poverty in old rundown apartment dwellings. (Charley sighs) The poor tenants trapped in these buildings must put up with constant harassment by greedy landlords, who wanna throw them out for higher rents. These rich slum lords go to ruthless extremes to evict poor tenants, and nothing seems to stop them. When you can't afford to move, even a rat-infested tenement can be called home. - [Charley] Dammit, they turned the gas off again. - [Narrator] But when landlords turn off your heat, water, gas, and electricity to force you to move out, there's only one thing to do, fight. This is the story of such a struggle. (door creaking) - Turned the water off too, Jesus. (Charley sighs) - Hi, Charley. - Hey, Pops. - I see you've been out joggin' again, huh? - Yeah. - How's everything? - Everything's okay except that they shut the gas off on us and turned the water off again. - What? - Yeah. - Why those dirty bastards. I'll be back in a minute, I'll see if I can get it turned on again. Lousy sons of a bitches, they do this to me again... Hold it you bastards ,. (men groaning) Charley . (fists thudding) Electricity, hot water and gas. (fists thudding) (men groaning) And that's for the lights. (feet thudding) (men groaning) (dogs barking) I got him Charley ,. (Charley grunting) Hey Charley, not bad. Maybe that karate ain't so bad after all, huh? (elbow thudding) (Charley grunting) (fists thudding) (man groaning) - Who sent you? - I swear to God, I don't know. Somebody gave me $50 to pull the wires out. I don't know nothin'. - Oh, let 'em go, Charley, they're just punks, they don't know anything. (dogs barking) Get outta here punk, and don't come back. (door slamming) I guess we showed them Charley, huh? And those money-grubbing landlords, we ain't movin' and nobody's movin', over my dead body. - I understand, Pop. - Hey you know, you're pretty good at that karate. - I know, not bad yourself, you know. (Louis chuckling) (muffled talking) I've been practicing, you know? (karate students grunting) - Speedy, let's work out a little bit we don't have that much time. - Yeah okay, that's cool. (speaking foreign language) (feet thudding) (both grunting) (Charley grunting) (body thudding) (Charley grunting) - What you doin' on the floor, bro, is that what they're teachin' you in the streets? (Speedy grunting) - Now who's on the floor, my man? - Ah, Speedy, I'm not tryin' to say that you're no good. I'm only sayin' you'd be a lot better if you worked out more often. - Get plenty of work in the street, my man. And if we don't hurry and get out of here, your old man's gonna kick both our asses, yours and mine. (light dramatic music) (car engine rumbling) (car doors slamming) (dogs barking) (tense music) (rats squeaking) - Hey, what you guys doin' down there? Hey, they're putting rats in the building, help. Help. Building- (man chuckling) - Hey, hey, old man. - Help, help. - Give me that hat, old man. - Hey, old man. - Help. - What's the matter, you don't like those rats old man? - So I'm tellin' her, I love you too, baby, but I got some business downtown- - Is that right? - And I got my ass the hell out of there, Jack. - What the hell is this, man? Check this out. - Hey hey hey help help. - You understand me? - Now, my man, hey, hey, what's happening, what's happening? What's wrong with you? - Yeah, what are you doin'? - Hey, hey. - Let's go. (foot thudding) (Charley grunting) - Yeah, kick his ass kick his ass. (foot thudding) (Charley grunting) - Oh shit . (fists thudding) (feet thudding) (tires screeching) - Get your hat off the ground- - Hey man, stop it. Hey man, they're pouring rats in our building. Them landlords must want us out bad. (tenants yelling over each other) - [Man] We're movin' outta here, Barbara. - But I've got to talk to the landlord. - I said we're moving. - He's coming, here he comes. Here come an old man. - What the hell is it now? - [Man] First these guys put rats in the building. (tenants yelling over each other) - Hold it hold it hold it. - They're beatin' up on this old man and they're putting rats in the building. - What are we gonna do? I thought we were gonna be safe now? - Hey Louis, you told us the court was behind us. - Charley? - Uncle John caught these two guys putting some rats in the hallways. - Okay, let 'em go. - No, let's get 'em. - Take him inside. - Let him go? (tenants yelling over each other) - I said let them go. Now, I'm gonna tell you all once more, they don't know who they're working for. This whole block is owned by the Iguana Realty Company. It's what you call a dummy corporation. Nobody knows the real owners. But we're organized now, and we'll beat these bastards if we stick together and hang on. Now, nobody, and I mean nobody moves, right? - [Tenants] Right. - Let's go. - We let 'em go this time, but we gonna get 'em, we gonna get 'em cold. - Yeah. - Yeah. (light jazz music) - Well, you see how it is, gentlemen. We must empty these buildings immediately or the deal will fall through and we stand to lose millions of dollars, as you well know. Now, since we've exhausted all legal means of evicting these people, we're going to have to resort to shall I say, extra-legal procedures. - Ain't that what I told you? I told you all this shit with lawyers was wasting our time. - Young man, this country was built under the rule of law. - Yeah, and I thought you was gonna fix this deal with the law, what happened to that, Judge? - Unfortunately, Judge Bacon seems to be what is laughingly referred to as an honest judge. I could do nothing. - So, where does that leave us, Alden? - We have no help from the law. Does anyone have any plans for an alternative course of action? - What happened with the rats? - I beg your pardon? - My little plan with the rats I got you, how did it work? - What's all this crap about rats? - It was just a little idea of Mr. Jackson's that didn't quite work out. - Christ, rats, turn off the electricity, turn off the water, what is this, the amateur hour? When are we gonna begin to do business, for Christ sakes? - Sure, let's shoot them all and go to jail. Would that suit you, Mr. Albano? - Look, don't be a wise ass with me. - All right, all right, now calm down. Look, all I mean to say is we gotta be careful. Because if we're not careful we'll have the law working against us instead of for us, all right? - That's the trouble with this country today, the laws are all twisted to protect that sort. Everything for those welfare people. - Cut the bullshit, Engstrom, Camel had you in his pocket for 20 years. - Gentlemen, gentlemen. (cane thudding) Gentlemen. This is getting us nowhere. - Nowhere is right. Look Alden, you promised us you could handle this deal. - And I will handle it, I've already begun to. And I would have succeeded already but there's this troublemaker stirring up the tenants. An ex-fighter, named Roman. - Good god, Alden, do you mean to tell me that a multi-million dollar deal is being held up by some little punch-drunk boxer? - This one's no ordinary troublemaker. - So don't give him an ordinary payoff, give him an extraordinary payoff, but let's get it done for God sakes. - Waste of time. - Everything in its time, Mr. Albano. I've sent a man to contact Roman. As soon as I speak with him about our generous offer, we'll all be in the clear and several million dollars richer. I'll contact each of you later on this evening with the results. Oh, and one more thing, gentlemen. In the event that Mr. Roman refuses our generous offer, he will of course be, in one way or the other, eliminated. (tense music) (cat meowing) They're all in line. Soon we'll be in a position to control this entire deal. It's working out exactly as you said, it's brilliant. (horns honking) (sirens wailing) (explosion booming) (sirens wailing) (horns honking) - Dammit, here we go again. (gasoline splashing) (lighter clicking) (foot stomping) (fist thudding) (Charley grunting) (foot thudding) (Charley grunting) (man grunting) (Charley grunting) (fist thudding) (Charley grunting) (fist thudding) (man screaming) (man yelling) (Charley grunting) (fist thudding) (foot thudding) (fists thudding) (Charley groaning) (foot thudding) (Charley grunting) (man panting) Who sent you? - I don't know, I don't know. - Dammit, don't lie to me. - I don't know. - Who sent you? - They just gave me $10. (man panting) I don't know when. (dog barking) Let me go, let me go, let me go. - Who sent you? - I don't know. Please, please. - Was he in a vehicle? - I don't know (gasping). (man groaning) (dog barking) - Go. (pole clinking) (karate students grunting) Okay, here you are. (speaking foreign language) (karate students grunting) (speaking foreign language) Just jump. (pole clinking) (karate students grunting) Mr. Leacock, this is the advanced class. Please leave dojo until your class begin. (Speedy scoffs) (door creaking) (door slamming) - Hey, what's happening, Speedy? How you been? (hands slapping) What's happening? - Shibata just threw me out the dojo. - Ah, special class for his sons again? - Special class, my ass. - Well you know they are good, you know that. - What are we, boy scouts? - You can't blame a guy for preferring his own sons, Speedy, you know that. - Why not, he's suppose to be a karate man. - Hey, I understand Speedy, but he's always been good to me, you know, sort of like a second father. Besides, ever since I was a little child him and my old man were just like that. (door creaking) (door slamming) Come on, let's go get our workout. I told the old man we'd meet him later on anyway, come on. (door creaking) (door slamming) - [Louis] No . - I beg your pardon? - I think you heard, I said no. - Perhaps you should take some time to think about it. 10,000, that's a lot of money. - Let me tell you somethin', pal, I don't have to think about it. You're all the same, you rich bastards. You think you wave a handful of money and everybody's gonna jump. Well those buildings ain't just made of bricks, you know. People live in those buildings, people. And as crummy as those dumps are, they're people's homes, and don't forget it, mister. They're not leaving and I'm not leaving. So you can take this here polite bribe and you can shove it up your polite ass. (door thudding) (rotary phone clicking) - Hello, it's perfect, he refused it outright. I'll inform the others to hear their opinions, although I have no doubt as to what their decisions will be. (phone thudding) - Well my friend, I talked to the bastard who is the head of the landlord syndicate. - And? - And what? He offered me money and I told him to shove it, the bastard, but at least I know who he is now. And if he wants to do anything about it, he'll have me to deal with, and this. - Ah, my friend. Has it come to that? All for the few building, that's not worth living in? Is that worth your life? - My life? No. It's not the buildings, goddamn the buildings. You know it's funny, I always hated the buildings. It's the goddamn landlords driving in their big fancy cars, living in mansions with their fat-assed wives. All our money goes to rent, we're barely makin' it. They get it all. Shibata, what are we gonna do? There's no place else to go from here but down. The next place is the gutter. It just ain't right, you know. - It's simple, Louis. - It just ain't right that they should push us around like we was garbage. Anyway, I ain't dead yet. And if anything should happen, you know, I want you to give this here to Charley. The bastard's name is here, and the whole story. You know how hot-headed the kid is, why he'll run out and he'll get himself killed. Just give him a little while to cool off. By then, he'll know what to do with this name. - You have my word, my friend. But have you thought of the police? - What police, they own the police. Anyway, who's committed a crime? But my, my son Charley... - You have my word, your son's alive, he stays while you no death, my friend. Still hope you're wrong. - Yeah, I suppose we can hope for that, Shibata. My friend, my good friend, Shibata. (rotary phone clicking) (phone ringing) - Yeah, hello. Yeah, Albano residence. - Hello, Jake, Alden here. May I speak with Mr. Albano? (cat meowing) - Hey boss, it's brains on the phone. I mean Mr. Alden. - Hello, Alden? Right. Right. What do I think? What do you think I think? You want me to put out the contract? You got somebody? You better not mess this up. Just kill the bastard and forget it. - It's just like you said, (cat meowing) they'll all line up, like sheep. (pins clanking) - Then the next one was my biggest fight. And your mother, God rest her soul, she was the best fight critic I ever saw or ever heard of. She says to me, ''Louis, you're not ready. ''Sugar Ray is gonna kick your ass.'' Well, she didn't say kick your ass, but that's what she meant. Sure enough, he did. (Speedy laughing) Sugar Ray, he was the best. And I'll tell you something, it's no shame to have your ass kicked by Sugar Ray, right? - That's right, you better believe it. (car engine rumbling) (phone ringing) - Hello. Yeah, oh hello Alden, what can I do for you? Yeah, he won't? 10,000, shh. Well, we sure as hell can't wait any longer, get rid of him. What, how? I don't give a damn how. Ask Albano, he used to be a hit man. Yeah, yeah, right. Okay, so long. For Christ sake baby, I'm driving. Later, later, huh. (woman whispering) Oh, that's different. (light music) (Louis sighs) - No, no, that's enough about my fights. I must've told you about them 50 times anyway. - Oh, come on Pops, tell us more about the Foreman fight. (Louis chuckling) - Come on, Uncle Louis, once more. - No, no, no, it's late and I'm not gettin' any younger and I gotta get my rest, you know? Hey. * What love can bring - You're good boys, both of you. My son, and my other son, I love you both. - Goodnight Pop. What's this, huh? - Uh, it's nothing Charley. - Huh? - [Charley] What is it? - It's just a little precaution. What with the way things are going on the block, I just don't want you to worry about it. - But wait a minute, what do you mean, the way things are going on the block? We've never had anything like this before. - Look, I don't want you to worry about it. It's just an old man's ideas, that's all. Now, just forget it, and have yourselves a good time, and I'll see you tomorrow. * I'd stay away (bar patrons talking over each other) * But how it's gone so fast * I just couldn't last (traffic humming) (car brakes squeaking) (car horn honking) (phone ringing) - Hello? Judge Engstrom's residence. - [Alden] E. Bautly Alden here, for Judge Engstrom. - One moment, please. Judge, Mr. Alden waiting for you on the phone. (classical music) - Alden, yes. (chair creaking) He wouldn't? What the hell is going on nowadays? It's that goddamn welfare, it spoils them. Oh, I don't care what you do. Yes, I want you to do something, but I don't want to hear about it. What do you mean, why? You just can't come out and tell a judge of the state supreme court that you're having somebody murdered. Yes, dammit, I agree. Well, what are you waiting for? Goodnight. - Junior, I just want the stuff, I won't ask you for anything more. (light jazz music) (phone ringing) Please. Junior don't do me like this. - This is Jackson. Shit, put him away. (Jackson laughing) Yeah, let me know. So long. (bag crinkling) (hand slapping) (bag crinkling) Now, don't let that door hit you in the ass. - Junior, you won't tell anybody will you? You swear you won't tell anybody? Because if my old man finds out he'll kill me. He'll kill me. * Keep the pounding tough * Keep the pounding tough * Keep the pounding tough * Keep the pounding tough - [Jackson] I told you, baby, you can leave any time, bitch. (swanky jazz music) * Keep the pounding tough * Keep the pounding tough * Keep the pounding tough * Keep the pounding tough - Hey, my man, why you look so down all of the sudden? - I'm just a little worried, Speedy. I've never seen my father packing a rod before. And I just don't like it, you know? I'm going home, goodnight. - Wait for me. Want me to hang out, blood? - No, it's okay, Speed, I'm just a little jumpy man. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - Solid. - Okay. (muffled talking) (sirens wailing) Oh my god. - Charley, Charley what is it my man, what's happenin'? Oh, damn. (car horn honking) (rotary phone clicking) (phone ringing) - [Shibata] Hello, this is Shibata. - Master Shibata, this is Speedy. Master Shibata, Mr. Roman is dead. - [Shibata] Dead, my friend's dead? - Yeah, I said dead, Charley and I just found him. - [Shibata] How did it happen? - I don't know, I don't- - [Shibata] Where's Charlie, how is he? - He looks bad, he flew out past me like, like he didn't even know me. - [Shibata] Stay with him. Don't leave him, I'll call the police. Go now, hurry. - Right, okay, bye. (somber music) - [Charley] Oh god, how could he be dead? Pop. If I'd gone with you, this never would have happened. I'll get him, whoever did this, I'll get him. I swear it, he's going to pay for this, I promise. Why would anyone want to kill him? And how, he was carrying a gun. How could anyone get so close without him putting up a fight? I'll revenge your death Pop, if it's the last thing I do. (somber music continues) - I was waiting at your house, come inside. - Who are they? I'll kill 'em, I swear to god, I'll kill each and every one of them. - [Shibata] This the letter you want. - Give it to me. - [Shibata] It's from your father. - I said give it to me. - [Shibata] I'm so sorry, I cannot. - Dammit I want those names. (fist pounding) - That's not who your father is. He entrust me to hold you for awhile. If you still want it, I shall give it to you. - I want those names. - [Shibata] What will you do with them if you have them? You are not a man enough yet. - Then I shall die. Let them kill me too. - [Shibata] That was not your father's wish either. - But he was your friend, help me. What am I gonna do? - If you want to find the men who kill your father, you must learn more than you know now. - What do you mean learn, there's nothing to learn. - Charley, when you were born, your father saved my life. Now, I cannot pay him back, but I can save his son. He asked me to do this. He was my family, will you listen to me? - Yes, Master Shibata, I'm sorry. - I will send you to a great master. He will teach you anything you want to know. He was my teacher too. - Then I'll go now. - [Shibata] But your father's funeral. - I will honor my father best by avenging his death, not by weeping at his funeral. - You are your father's son, my boy. - Look my man, where you goin'? - Look Speedy, I'm going away and I'll be gone awhile, you understand? - But where are you going? What are you gonna do? Why don't you just lay here and we'll work on it together. - I'll have plenty to do, Speedy. - [Speedy] Charley, Charley, I wanna help you, my man. - Listen, nobody can help me, Speedy. This is something that I've got to do alone, you understand? It's my job. (drawer thudding) Don't worry, Pop, I'll be back. I'll be back and I'll get even for what they did to you. (plane roaring) (upbeat funky music) (trash clanking) - Hey Joey, what's with this? - Look at all this shit, some sucker dumped it here last night. - Some sucker who? - Some sucker who do you think who? First they turn off the heat, then they turn off the gas, then they turn off the lights, then they turn us on to some rats, and now they're turning garbage trucks over on us. So dig it, everybody's gettin' a bit turned off, you know. - Yeah, I hear you. Maybe I better keep my eyes open around here a couple of days, huh? (gentle flute music) (fist knocking) - [Charley] Master Shibata sent me, he says you can teach me everything I need to know. (gentle flute music) (crickets chirping) (paper rustling) - Very well, very well, get up. Come inside with me. Do you know the Kata Sanchin? Please. (Charley sighs) (Charley deeply exhaling) Do this. (Master Ying deeply exhaling) (Master Ying grunting) (Master Ying deeply exhaling) - What is this? I came here to learn how to kill, and you treat me like a beginner. - Mr. Kim, will you come in for a moment? Mr. Kim is presently my only other student. He has been with me only three months. You wish to kill men, do you not? He's only a beginner, attack him. - Are you kidding? I didn't come here to play games with kids. I'll hurt him. - Perhaps. Attack him, Mr. Roman, and we shall see. (Charley grunting) (elbow thudding) (Charley grunting) (fist thudding) (Charley grunting) (Charley groaning) (body thudding) - Damn. - Thank you, Mr. Kim. And now, Mr. Roman, will you kindly do it my way? (Charley grunting) - [Charley] I'll tell you, Pop, it's not easy starting all over from the beginning, but I'll do it, I'll do anything, anything to get them. - Whoa. - I can't wait till I start working on some advanced training. I must get back and revenge my father's death. (drums pounding) I promise you, father, they'll all pay for it. I promise you that. - Stand up. (Charley deeply breathing) (Charley panting) (upbeat funky music) (birds chirping) (hand slapping) (body thudding) Bow, yes, but watch also. - [Charley] Don't worry, Pop, I'll be back. I'll be back and get even for what they did to you. (Sup grunting) (Charley grunting) (Sup groaning) (body thudding) - Come, it's time for dinner. (drums pounding) (car horn honking) (upbeat funky music) (crickets chirping) (pole thudding) - The panther sleep with one eye open. (upbeat funky music) (car door slamming) - Hey, my man. - [Man] Get him. - [Charley] The time will come, and when it does I'll kill them with my bare hands. (fists thudding) (Charley grunting) (birds chirping) (Charley yelling) (throwing star thudding) (birds chirping) (car horn honking) - Gentlemen, our problems are over. The last tenants have left and demolition is due to start within a few weeks. Soon we shall be rich men, or richer perhaps. (Alden laughing) Well, and you, I suppose you'll be going into politics now. - I believe I will run for Congress. Money and my record, how can I lose? It's time for stricter law and order in this country and some decent respect for the traditions this country was founded on. - Starting your campaign speeches a little early aren't you? (men laughing) - What about you, Flashy? - Man, I'm gonna get me a Silver Cloud Rolls-Royce a block long, custom made with bullet proof windows, just like the president. I'm gonna fill that Rolls with a variety of foxy broads. And every motherfucker in Harlem is gonna be breakin' his neck when I cruise by. - You people just don't think like big businessmen. Hm, investments, smart investments, now that's the way to make your money grow. - Investments my ass. I'll have enough money to get away now. All my life I ain't seen nothin' but Brooklyn. I wanna go to China and France and Turkey, and Italy and Mama Mia and Napoli. - What about you, Mursky? - Nothing fancy, I'm just gonna get the hell out of this crummy city and live like a human being. I think I'll buy a hotel in Miami. - Possibly a good investment. - Well, anyway, I'm gonna sit in the sun in my penthouse and have only the best people over. - And a colored maid and butler serving drinks, right? - Right. - Well, good luck to you all, but when you come back to town, look me up. By that time I will have accumulated enough real estate interests to satisfy all your needs for housing. - Good afternoon, Mr. Alden. - How are you, Mike? - This is it, huh? - So, this is what we're talking about, eh? - That's the one. - Mm hm. - Up there, that whole thing going down there. - Yeah, I told you. - We're gonna go down right to the corner. - And us? All these buildings are ours, right? - How about that, huh? - Right. - Corner and all the way down. - That's not bad, Alden, you did a- - Well done, Alden. - Well I told you, I told you. - Very good, I think we're gonna do all right here. - Man, any time you're in Florida, you come down and see me, and bring some of that money along, you hear? - [Jackson] I won't be one of the colored help. - Hey because that whole block sold out. Man, that's a great, huh? - Great job, man. (men talking over each other) - [Mike] Mr. Alden, there's that guy that's been following us around. (upbeat funky music) - Enjoy it while you can, suckers. - Hey you two, run up there and bring that little bastard down here to me. - Who's that guy up there? - [Alden] Not you Mike, they'll take care of it. (upbeat funky music) (hatch clanking) - Where is he? (upbeat funky music continues) - You lookin' for me? - There he is. (man grunting) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (fists thudding) (feet thudding) (man groaning) (metal clanking) (man groaning) (fist thudding) (man groaning) (foot thudding) (Speedy grunting) (Speedy grunting) (foot thudding) (speaking foreign language) (man grunting) (fist thudding) (man groaning) (man grunting) (arm crunching) (man groaning) (Speedy grunting) (man groaning) (Speedy grunting) (fly buzzing) - Flies annoys me. (fly buzzing) (bowl clanking) - [Charley] The time is almost here, Pop, I'm ready. (cup clinking) (Charley grunting) (pole thudding) (body thudding) - Rise, my son. The time for your mission has come. (gentle flute music) - [Charley] Oh God, whoever you are, please help me. Give me the strength I need for my mission ahead. I've got to get to Master Shibata's and get that letter. Pop, I'm going home, I'll keep my promise. (gentle flute music) - Hey Charley. - So long, Sup. - Listen, I'm gonna be comin' to New York, where can I find you? - Probably at Master Shibata's dojo but I'll be pretty busy. - I know, Master Ying has told me. Anyway, good luck. - Thank you, I'll see you again, my friend. - Oh no, not again. (upbeat funky music) - Master Ying sends his regards. - [Shibata] How is the old man? - He does not change much. - No, that's true, but he's well? - Yes, yes he is well. - And you my boy, are you well? - I am ready. - [Shibata] Ready? You have not changed then. - It is time, I have come for the letter. - [Shibata] Very well. - Thank you. (door thudding) (birds chirping) - [Louis] ''My son, Charley, when you read this letter I will be dead. The circumstances of my death, Shibata will have told you. E. Bautly Alden is my murderer, even if he did not do it with his own hands. He and his kind will continue to trample on poor people like us until someone puts an end to them. You must stop him before it's too late. Promise me, Charley, that you will help the poor people that are unable to help themselves. Your fight will be a long and lonely one, but always remember who your enemies are. They have no heart, no human feelings, and will stop at nothing. Please stop those murderers, Charley. Stop them cold, it's my last wish, I love you.'' - Charley, damn, good to see you. - How you doin', Speedy? - When'd you get back? - I just got back today. - Well look, let's, I'll buy you dinner, come on. - No, no, I'd better not. - Come on bro, I ain't seen you since- - Since my father was murdered? Yes, I know, but I have some very important business to take care of. - I'll help. - No, you can't help. This I've got to do alone. It would be better if you were seen without me for awhile. - Alden, Albano, Mursky, Engstrom, Jackson, that's who killed your father. - But how do you know, my father only knew Alden. - I've been followin' them for six months. I know where they go, when they go there, what they do when they get there, I know them inside out. I want to help. - No, they killed my father, this is my business. - Let me help, Charley. Besides, I've got my own reasons for helping. And you know what your father meant to me. - Okay, you can help, but this is my fight. - Okay, okay, come on, let's go. - [Charley] E. Bautly Alden, brains of the deal. Albano, punk mafioso. Mursky, you rich pig. Judge Engstrom, some kinda judge. No Mercy Jackson, you filthy scum. Albano is first. (birds chirping) (bow string rattling) (arrow thudding) - Hey boss. Here's your scotch and soda. (leaves crunching) - Look at that Jake, not bad eh? Three bullseyes outta five. Go ahead Jake, let me see if you can get three outta five. - No, no, boss, I couldn't do it. - Try it Jake. Hey, use your own bow. Where's your bow? - I don't know boss, somewhere in the shed. - Well go find it. (leaves crunching) - Too open here boss, you oughtn't to be out here alone. - Jake, put that gun away. I told you, them days are over. I'm sick of you following me around with that cannon. Everywhere I go. You think I got 25 bodyguards all over the grounds here so I can worry when I'm relaxin' in my yard? Jake, go find your bow. (birds singing) (fist thudding) (Charley grunting) (body thudding) (Speedy grunting) (hand thudding) (dogs barking) (fist thudding) (Charley grunting) (fence rattling) (shed door creaking) - Ah where the hell are ya? Where the hell are ya? I don't like leaving the boss alone like that. Come on, son of a bitch, where are you? (birds chirping) - [Albano] Who the hell are you? (Charley grunting) (fist thudding) (glass clinking) - It's right here. Aha, arrows. Where is that bow? - Do you know this man? - [Albano] No, no, no. - His name is Louie Roman, he was my father. You and your boys had him killed but you don't even know him, do you? (muffled talking) You're gonna pay for this fatso, and you'll know who did it. - There you are you little bastard. Comin', boss. (birds chirping) Hey boss I found it. Now where did he go? I better look for him. Nah, I better not. ''Jake, don't follow me around,'' that's what he said. I better practice on my own. (arrow clacking) Watch. (arrow whooshing) (Albano groaning) I'll show 'em how it's done. (Jake chuckling) (arrow whooshing) (Albano groaning) Not bad, not bad at all. (arrow whooshing) (arrow thudding) God. Jesus Christi . God, I told you so. (rotary phone clicking) Hello, Alden. - Yes, Jake. When? Who was it, Jake? (cat meowing) You don't know, is that what you're telling me, Jake? You mean somebody took that small army down there and dismantled it, pulled it apart, is that what you're telling me? Get over here right away. (cat meowing) It seems that somebody executed Mr. Albano. What do you make of that? (Alden laughing) (rotary phone clicking) (phone ringing) - What the hell do you mean Albano's dead? Nobody has any idea? Come on, Alden, people don't just get killed for no reason. Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, maybe it was the mob. But what do you plan to do now? Sit tight, you're goddamn right I'll sit tight. - [Charley] It's Mursky's turn. He might be expecting us. (hands slapping) (chairs creaking) (both laughing) - I'd love to see those guys show up here. - Come on Millie, the car's waiting downstairs. Oh, Christ, I got another one of my headaches. Where is that bitch? Come on Millie, let's go, let's go. Come on, let's go for Christ sake. Let's go for Christ sake. (dramatic music) (Speedy grunting) - It's not me it's not me. (Millie gasps) (door thudding) (foot thudding) (man screaming) (dramatic funky music) (trash can crashing) Come on. (Charley grunting) Get us outta here fast. (tires screeching) (dramatic funky music) - [Charley] You, Mursky, rich pig. Let's see where your money gets you now. (tires screeching) (dramatic funky music) (tires screeching) (gate clanking) (tires screeching) (Charley yelling) (tires screeching) - Go back, get that son of a bitch. I want him dead, now. (tires screeching) (Charley grunting) (window shattering) (Charley yelling) (tires screeching) - [Charley] I promise you, father, they'll all pay for it. I promise you that. - This is obviously no coincidence. - Coincidence? Man, somebody's after our asses. What are we gonna do about it? - What do you propose we do about it, Mr. Jackson? - Listen, Albano and Mursky are dead. All we hear is two kids did it. We don't know who they are. But what we gotta do now, is get 'em to come to us. - Excellent, Mr. Jackson, brilliant, a trap. Of course a trap requires bait. Are you volunteering for that role? If not you, then who? Mr. Alden, me perhaps you were thinking? No, Mr. Jackson, I think not. I don't know, nor do I much care what you gentlemen plan to do. As for myself, I intend to use my own security. It's functioned quiet nicely for me in the past. Good afternoon, gentlemen. - Shit, his security has functioned quite nicely. Okay, fuck him. If he goes there's more for us. And I plan to stick around and get mine. (rotary phone clicking) - It's Alden, they're gone. It's working perfectly. - [Charley] And now the judge. What do you know about him? - He's got lots of private guards, that's cool. But he's got two New York City cops guarding his room. We wanna get in to working with cops? - No, no, cops we don't need. I have a better idea, an old Japanese assassin's trick. (frog croaking) (Engstrom snoring) (suspenseful music) (fist knocking) (fist thudding) - Hey, what was that? - Stick over here, this is our detail. - Yeah. - Don't worry about that. Let them guys take care of it. - Give me 10 minutes. - Gotcha. (suspenseful music) (Engstrom snoring) (suspenseful music) * Small and dark and young and lovely - Hey, hey what was that? - Forget it, stick right here. - Yeah well, they can take care of it. There's a couple of guys down there. (suspenseful music) * Yo, yo, hey, yo mama Okay, I'm done. (suspenseful music) (Engstrom snoring) (suspenseful music) (muffled talking) - After all, the judge is a pretty good guy, we'll take care of him while he's laying there. We were told to stay here, so we'll stay here. That's all, I think they can handle it. - Better than poundin' the beat in the park. - You don't get these kind of jobs all the time, so let's take advantage of it. I hope nothin' really happened down there, I don't think so. Well, we were told to stay here by the sergeant, so here we stay. (suspenseful music) (Engstrom snoring) This is a pretty soft beat. - [Police Officer] Not bad. (light dramatic music) (tense music) (muffled talking) - [Police Officer] Be here than pounding beat in the park. - [Police Officer] Well we were told to stay here, so here we'll stay. After all, the judge is a pretty good guy, we'll take care of him while he's... (Engstrom snoring) (Engstrom gasping) Hey, what was that? (Engstrom groaning) (foot thudding) (Charley grunting) (fist thudding) (man groaning) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (Charley grunting) (fist thudding) (Speedy grunting) (speaking foreign language) (knee thudding) (elbow thudding) (Charley grunting) (body groaning) (Charley grunting) (foot thudding) (foot thudding) (Speedy grunting) (speaking foreign language) - [Charley] What about Jackson? - Charley, I want this prick. - I can dig where you're comin' from, Speedy, but he killed my father. - No, you can't dig where I'm comin' from, you don't know. Remember I told you I had my own reasons for helping you? Well, this is the sucker that killed my brother. - Your brother? What brother, I didn't even know you had a brother. - I don't anymore, this mother killed him. This chump is the ace dude for drugs in Harlem, understand? Five years ago, my little brother OD'd. 12 years old, he was 12 years old. He nodded out on a rooftop with this pig's junk in his veins, and never woke up. This nigga killed him just like he put a gun to his head and blew out his brains. He ripped my brother then, and he's rippin' my people off right now. And this motherfucker calls himself a black man? I want his ass. (hands slapping) - You got him. (dramatic funky music) - What did you want, man? - Special delivery for Mr. Jackson. Are you Jackson? - No. - Sorry, I got to give it to Emanuel Jackson. - I'm his mother, you dig? - [Speedy] Yeah, well that's cool, you got it, mother. (paper crinkling) - ''Jackson, you're dead, special delivery.'' You see a stamp on this letter, you dumb son of a bitch? Get him, get me that mailman. You two get him. (dramatic funky music) - Go. There he is. (dramatic funky music) Hey man, turn around. Hey man, this ain't the dude. Well look at shorty here. (man laughing) (Charley grunting) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (Charley grunting) (foot thudding) (boots thudding) (rats squealing) - [Jackson] Hey brother, what can I do for you? - Die, brother, that's what you can do for me. (wrist cracking) (woman screaming) (Jackson groaning) (arm cracking) (Jackson screaming) (Charley grunting) (fist thudding) (man groaning) (Charley grunting) (foot thudding) (body thudding) (rats squealing) (woman screaming) - [Speedy] Just sit down. Here's a present from the skinny little kids on the block. (Jackson screaming) (woman screaming) (rats squeaking) (Jackson screaming) (woman screaming) (Jackson groaning) (woman screaming) (Charley grunting) (foot thudding) (dramatic funky music) (Charley grunting) (fist thudding) (man gasping) (dramatic funky music) (woman screaming) - Damn. - Albano, Mursky, Engstrom. (cat meowing) And today, Jackson. Next, they'll be coming for me. You know, I think they'll be surprised as to what we have arranged for them. - And now for the big boy, he should be tougher. One left, Speedy. - Solid, when? - Let's take the night off, we'll do it tomorrow. - That's cool. (glasses clinking) (traffic humming) - It's okay, Mike, everything's all set. - Just like you said, Mr. Alden. - Who's on the intercom down here? - Laslow, it's okay, he's a good boy. - What about the elevators? - I checked it twice. - Well then, let's check it again. - [Sup] Charley. - Sup, what are you doing here? - I flew in. I told you I was comin' to New York. - Who the hell is grasshopper? - I don't know what he is, but he's not exactly a grasshopper. Speedy Leacock, Sup Kim. Now go home, you understand? - Hey, Charley, where you guys goin'? - We're going somewhere dangerous, Sup. - Good, I'm comin'. - And you ain't comin'. Charley, we ain't got time to jerk with Kato here. - Exactly what I said so, take me along, otherwise, you know I'm gonna come with you. - Okay, okay. You don't know this kid, Speedy. But look, here's what we're into. - Laslow, tell 'em we're comin' up. - Mike and Mr. Alden are on their way up. - Okay, boss, it's like you say, the building's vacant from 10 on up. If you push any floor up to 10, the elevator works as usual. (elevator whirring) (car horn honking) But if you push any button above 10... It still stops at 10. - Oh excellent, excellent. What if they come up the stairs? Or what if they get off at a lower floor and then come up the stairs? - Come on, I'll show you. Don't worry, it's a foolproof trap. (gun clicking) No one's gettin' in here unless they've got a tank. - Now, Sup, you stay with Speedy, you understand? Okay. (tense music) I promise you, father, they'll all pay for it. I promise you that. (tense music) (pipes hissing) - They're here, they're comin' up the elevator. - Right. They're here, they're comin' up the elevator. (tense music) (Alden sighs) (tense music) (machines whirring) (gunshots banging) - Well, okay boys, how about a drink? (tense music) - What the hell? - Listen, we don't have time to figure it out now. (tense music) - Michael. - Thank you. - Allen. - What is this? - Let's go. (tense music) - Hold it. Be cool, we got to wait. - Ah, I'd like to propose a toast. (glasses clinking) Here's to our enemies. - Bottoms up. - Long may they fall. (men sighing) (dramatic music) (Speedy grunting) (door crashing) - Son of a bitch. (gunshots banging) (Speedy grunting) (Allen groaning) (Sup grunting) (foot thudding) (Speedy grunting) (Mike grunting) (Sup grunting) (feet thudding) (Mike grunting) (foot thudding) (Mike groaning) (back cracking) (Mike groaning) (foot thudding) (Mike screaming) - All right everybody hold it. I don't know how you got by my men downstairs, but this is the end of the line. You people didn't really think that I was gonna be as easy as Jackson and Engstrom and the rest of 'em, did ya? (suspenseful music) - Alden. (Charley grunting) (Alden groaning) (dramatic funky music) (door slamming) I'll take care of him. Clean up this mess and meet me upstairs. - You get those two, I'll get them. All right, Sup? (man screaming) (body thudding) (Sup gasping) (man grunting) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (Sup hollering) (Mike grunting) (foot thudding) (Mike groaning) (man panting) (Sup hollering) (foot thudding) (Mike grunting) (Speedy groaning) (Mike grunting) (Speedy hollering) (man screaming) (Mike grunting) (man yelling) (Mike grunting) (man yelling) (nunchucks whooshing) (Sup panting) (Sup hollering) (Mike growling) - Who. (dramatic funky music) (Mike grunting) (foot thudding) (Mike groaning) (man grunting) (Sup hollering) (nunchucks thudding) (man groaning) (man yelling) (nunchucks thudding) (man groaning) (man yelling) (man groaning) (Sup hollering) (foot thudding) (Mike groaning) (Speedy grunting) (Mike groaning) (nunchucks rattling) - [Speedy] Come on, Sup. (door creaking) (door thudding) (door creaking) (door slamming) (Alden groaning) (Alden coughing) - Oh my God. (Alden groaning) Oh no. (suspenseful music) (cat meowing) - Come. (door slamming) (car horn honking) - Master Shibata, you got the machine guns? - Yes, me. - Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't know. I never understood, until now. - But you understand now, Charley, don't you? - Yes, I couldn't understand my father having been killed by a single blow, without even going for his gun. How could anyone have gotten that close? Now I know, but why? - I want you to understand before you die. I'm a member of Yakuza, you know the name? The most powerful organization in Japan. In Japan, we take what we want. Here, we must be more careful. It was necessary that I kill your father. - But he was your friend. - I have no friend, he was in my way, so I kill him. It was easy. And I used you to kill them for me. And now, it's your turn. (man grunting) (foot thudding) (Speedy grunting) (fists thudding) (fist thudding) (Sup groaning) (man grunting) (Speedy grunting) (foot thudding) (Sup groaning) (man grunting) (Sup hollering) (hand slapping) (man yelling) (man grunting) (Speedy hollering) (fists thudding) (body thudding) (Speedy hollering) (man grunting) (Sup grunting) (man grunting) (foot thudding) (Sup panting) (fist thudding) (man groaning) (man grunting) (feet thudding) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (man grunting) (fists thudding) (Sup groaning) (Sup hollering) (foot thudding) (man hollering) (Speedy panting) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (man grunting) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (man grunting) (Sup gasping) (fist thudding) (Sup groaning) (fist thudding) (Sup grunting) (fist thudding) (man groaning) (both hollering) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (wind whistling) (Speedy grunting) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (Speedy grunting) (man groaning) (man grunting) (feet thudding) (Sup hollering) (Sup panting) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (Sup hollering) (hand thudding) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (man grunting) (elbow thudding) (Sup grunting) (man groaning) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (foot thudding) (man groaning) (body thudding) (man groaning) (Sup sighs) - Hold it, hold it, this one is mine.

(door clanking) (wind whooshing) (bugs chirping) I've stopped them, father, I've stopped them. God have mercy on my soul. I've kept my promise. (wind whooshing) (upbeat funky music) * That's a promise * Bet you won't put your trust in me * Bet you won't let me go further than you can see * Bet you think I planned something and won't say it * If you think I'm thinking of a slicker way * That's a promise * I'm gonna get ya * That's a promise * I'm gonna blow your mind * That's a promise * I'm gonna get ya * That's a promise * I'm gonna blow your mind * How many times have I shook your hand * How many times have you walked away saying I'm your man * Count the times you've made me cry * If you think I'm gonna keep cryin' * Until the day I die * That's a promise * I'm gonna get ya * That's a promise * I'm gonna blow your mind * That's a promise * I'm gonna get ya * That's a promise * I'm gonna blow your mind (upbeat funky music) * I'm gonna blow your mind * That's a promise * That's a promise * I'm gonna blow your mind * That's a promise (groovy music)
