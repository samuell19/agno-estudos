Rip-Fixes-Sync by VaVooM Hi. Puppy Party Playdates? Yes, that's us. Hi. I'm Hailey, and my business partner, Dana, is just wrangling the puppies. The kids are so looking forward to this. Now, these are living, breathing puppies, right? Yep. I just want to make sure I didn't get everyone's hopes up and they're not some kind of robot toy or something. No. They are living, breathing puppies... ...who are ready to party. Okay, well, the kids will be arriving in about half an hour, so let me show you where to get set up. Okay, perfect. Here you go, you little rascal. Hailey... This might be the best birthday party Jenny's ever had. Well, that's what we like to hear. Last year, a parent gave me a bad Yelp review because their kid didn't like the party princess we hired. You got a Yelp review for a birthday party? Yeah. Let me tell you, parents can be ruthless these days. Well, I think you did an amazing job. Thank you. The shelter will contact you to set up a one-on-one visit. Feel free to contact them anytime. And take one of these. It's for the dog park. We could really use your signature. Bye, Georgie! See you soon! So how are we doing? Looks like we got some interest for Georgie. Yeah? Way to go, Georgie! You beat out all these puppies and you're eight years old? And four potential puppy adoptions. How about you? On our way to a positive Yelp review. Hi. Are you interested in adopting one of our rescue dogs? Hey, everyone! Who wants cake and ice cream? I think he likes you. I like him, too. What's his name? He doesn't have a name yet, but I've been calling him Rusty. Because of the color of his fur? No, but that's a good guess. Because I found him and his brother under a rusty old truck. Where does he live now? Well, he lives at the animal shelter, just till he can find his forever home, like all the dogs here. I don't think you like puppies at all, do you? What? I love puppies! I love all dogs! What's your name? Emmy. Well, nice to meet you, Emmy. I'm Hailey. I really want to get a dog, but my dad says we can't right now. I'm sorry. It's okay. He promises someday we will... but "someday" is always just another day, isn't it? How old are you, Emmy? Eight. Eight... Well, listen. Don't give up on your someday. I find, if you try hard enough, it's just around the corner. I hope so. You want to go inside and get some ice cream before all the puppies do? - Yeah. - Okay. That's for you. Thanks. It was a really fun birthday party. Thank you. Hey, you're not stealing a puppy in that bag, are you? No! Well, listen. You tell your dad that there are a lot of dogs in shelters that need a home, and they all think you would be a really great best friend. - Is that right? - Daddy! - You have fun? - Yeah, it was great! Though I'm afraid she's smitten, and I heard he's a real dog. Is that so? Well, if I were you, I would still check her goody bag because this little gal can be a sneaky one. I'm Ryan, Emmy's father. Gathered that. Hailey, Puppy Party host. Gathered that. Well, nice to meet you... briefly. You too... briefly. Thanks, Ann. My pleasure. Thanks for coming, Emmy. - Bye. - Bye. - These are for you. - Bye. Bye, Emmy. Bye! "Puppy Party host". So... I was talking to some of the mothers, and, apparently, your little friend's dad is single. And? And if you're not interested, I will gladly volunteer to explain to him all the benefits of a rescue dog. Come on, I saw the way you were looking at him! I was not looking at him, and you know what? If you were looking closely enough, you would see the way that he was looking at me in his nicely tailored suit. Who doesn't like a girl with frosting on her cheek? A guy in a nicely tailored suit. Anyway... we got almost 30 signatures for the dog park campaign today. Getting pretty close. If we get to a thousand, the Mayor will have to listen. Right? It's worth a shot. Come on, guys. How'd it go? Puppy mayhem as usual. And I bet they loved every minute of it. Didn't you? They did, and they are all ready for a good night's rest. You can go home once they're in their rooms. I'll lock up. Okay. Bye, Hailey. Let's go, let's go. We got four adoptions. Nice. These puppy parties are a great way to find families for the rescues. Yup! The parties are just a front. How long until Mia's puppies are ready? I'm actually gonna go meet with a veterinarian today, so I'll let you know tomorrow. Hey, you know, maybe you should call Birthday Mom from today and find out where Mr. Single Dad works, get him to sign the petition. Every signature helps, so... Bye. It does! Well, the stitches are healing well. No more unexpected litters from you, sweetheart. No one's claimed her yet? No. I put up signs. I bring photos of her to all my parties, but no one's come forward. And she's so sweet. She has to be a house dog... No collar, no microchip, no way to find the owner. Well, sometimes, when an owner finds out they're pregnant, they drop them off somewhere. Happens more often than you'd like to think. Well, she's lucky she wandered into my yard. I guess we both are. I've really grown to fall in love with her. Love them all, I bet. Yes! Well, with their last rounds of shots complete, you'll be able to find them homes. Thank you so much, Patricia. No problem. I will see you at the shelter. Okay, sounds perfect. Bye. Thanks. Okay! Who's ready for lunch, huh? What would you do if you hadn't found me? You'd be raising these rugrats all on your own, huh? Okay. Oh, goodness. - Hi, Fred. - Look. I can't get into my driveway when you park your van like that. It's... it's legally parked. There's not supposed to be any commercial vehicles parked on this street. Okay, well, I can go get my keys. Never mind! Just park it in your own driveway from now on, okay? Have a nice day! Fred. I'll get you those returns to you just as soon as we have them finished, Dave. As always, thanks for your business. And don't forget to look over the humanitarian grant we have announced. Lots of applications are coming in. Sure thing. Hey. Good morning, Mr. Hennessy. Hello, Hailey. How are you? Just fine, thank you. Your dad said you did a lot of work on my returns this year, and you're responsible for getting it done so quickly. Yeah, I sure am. Your father showed me your dog park petition earlier and I signed it right away. Thank you so much. I need all the support I can get. Thank you. - See you. - Bye. Dad, I'm sorry I'm late. I had to walk Mia and the rest of the puppies. How are they doing? They're doing well. Mia's healing up nicely after being spayed, and the puppies are almost ready for their new home. That's great. By the way, I just saw this this morning. Yet another developer trying to get their hands on the Bryant Street land. Nobody wants another shopping mall. Money talks. Puppy Party Playdates. This is Hailey. This is Ryan Hill. We met at the puppy party the other day. Emmy's dad? Yes. Yes, I remember. Hey, listen. All the puppies are accounted for, so if Emmy ended up taking one home, I had nothing to do with it. She wasn't hiding anything in her goody bag when we got home. I'd still check under her bed if I were you. I will. Listen, I know this is last minute, but Emmy hasn't stopped talking about those puppies. Her birthday's this Saturday, and she was just going to have some friends over, but now I'm wondering if I could surprise her with a puppy party instead. On Saturday? Sure. Let me just check my calendar. One sec. Yeah, we can do Saturday. Really? That'd be great! I've got your email here from the website. I could send you my information. Okay, great. Well, then, I look forward to seeing you... seeing... The party... I... I look forward to seeing you and Emmy both at the party on Saturday. Me too. I'll see you then. Bye. Another booking? Yeah, Saturday. What's that look? Do I have a look? More like a... a smile. What kind of smile? I'm not quite sure... but it's a very particular smile. Well, listen, Dad. I know that Mr. Jameson wants his taxes done by tomorrow, so do you happen to have that folder? Yeah. Mr. Mayor. How's the analysis coming, Ryan? - Almost done. - Good, good, because I'm getting a lot of pressure from Halston. Developers are always pushy. They don't understand the checks and balances we have to go through to make a project like this happen. Right, right. It is important that this does go through, though. We have a lot riding on this, Ryan. You don't see any unexpected hurdles, do you? No. Well, what about this petition that's going around? What petition? Grassroots. Local dog owners, I guess. They want the land turned into a dog park. I wasn't aware of a petition. Either way, we can't let it gain any traction. I want this signed, sealed, and delivered before they make any more waves. - I'm on it. - Good man. - Hi. - Hi. Nice to see you again. Yeah, nice to see you, too. - Hailey! - Hi! Hey, is it really your birthday, or are you just wanting to see the puppies? It's my birthday! They're so cute. Yeah? Do you want to help me find a place to set them up? Sure! Okay. Come on, puppies. Come on. Hi. Hi. I didn't introduce myself at the last party. - I'm Dana. - Hi. Best friend, business partner, well, part-time partner of this little non-profit we have here. I work at the shelter where we get the dogs. It's kind of a win-win. That must keep you really busy. It does, but I still have a lot of time 'cause I'm not really dating anyone, so... "Free time". Hey... "best friend, business partner", a little help? Coming. Okay. Daddy, do you see how much they like me? I see, sweetheart. I see. It means he's single. You should ask him out. What? No. No way. I can't do that. - Why not? - Because he's a client. - And...? - And it would be inappropriate. Why? Because it just would be, and because we're here on official business. Well, he was looking right through me at you. He was not. Yes, he was! Just go talk to him, before he crashes and burns those burgers. Hey, can I help you? "Puppy Party" plates. Yeah, well, you ordered the "deluxe" package. Now, if you ordered the super-deluxe package, we even clean up after the puppies when the party's over. Sounds expensive. But well worth it. Trust me. Sold. Emmy seems to be enjoying herself. She is! I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. This might mean she'll really, really want a puppy now. Yeah, well, you can always call us. "Puppy Party Playdates"... it's the next best thing, without the mess. As long as you order the super-deluxe package. - Right. - Hey, you! So sorry I'm late. No, just in time. Hey, Emmy! - Hi! - What's with all the puppies? This is Hailey. Puppy Party Playdates. Hailey, Kelly. We work together. Pleasure. Nice to meet you. So sorry to interrupt, but I do need to speak with Ryan, so you don't mind if I steal him for a sec? Yeah, yeah, sure. Of course. Plain... the works. Yeah, sure. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - See you later. Bye. Hey, thank you so much for letting me host your birthday party, Emmy. Those puppies would've been so bored all day if we weren't here. In fact, they asked me all morning, "When are we gonna go to Emmy's house?" That was the best birthday party I think I've ever had. Can I have another puppy party next week? You know, I-I think it's gonna be hard to convince your dad of that, but I did get you a very special present for the birthday girl. He's so cute! I'm never going to let him out of my sight. Thank you! You're welcome. Can I help put the puppies back in the van? Sure, if that's all right? Yeah, definitely. Dana's out in the driveway, loading them up. She has been asking me at least once a week for a dog. I think now I can expect that conversation every day. Yeah, well, if you ever decide to adopt, I can help you with that. I mean, I can... you know, help you with... find, like, a dog-sitter. I know what you mean. Ry, what do you want me to do with this leftover veggie tray? Toss? Save? What do you think? If it's edible, I always save it. Save it. Okay. Hailey, it was lovely to meet you. I hope to see you again. Nice to meet you, too. I should go. Of course. Thanks again. - Sure. Bye. - Bye. I know that look. What look? Like you lost your puppy. Well, all the puppies are accounted for, so... Didn't see her coming, did you? Who? Please! You know what, it doesn't even matter, because it's not like I'm ever gonna see him again. The party's over. What? This is the-the present that I gave Emmy. She said she loved it. She won't let out of her sight. Well, you've got to drop it off to them. I'll take Mia and the puppies back to your house. All right. Are you sure? Cable, ice cream, and puppies? Yeah, I'm sure. Okay. Maybe you should change first. That's a good idea. Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry to stop by like this. "Boojelly". What's Boojelly? Emmy's stuffed dog you gave her. She thought she lost him forever. Yeah, then I guess this is Boojelly. I found it in the van when I was unpacking. How on Earth did he end up in there? I guess she just left it in there when she was saying goodbye to the puppies. Thank you. It was nice of you to bring him back. Sure. It's nothing. Okay, well, say hi to Emmy for me. - I will. - Okay. Okay. Hey... Do you want to come in? We're making cookies. Well, trying to, anyway. I'm sure Emmy would want to say hello. I wouldn't want to interrupt. You won't be. Come on. You can return Boojelly yourself. Okay. Emmy! There's someone here to see you. Hi! You brought it! I mean, you found it. I sure did. Thank you. I won't ever leave him in your van again. How did you know he was in the puppy van? Excuse me! Oh, no. Dad, not again. Got milk? I don't think there's anything that can help wash these down. We were baking for my office party. Well, if it's not too late, I happen to be a really good baker. I could, you know, help you start another batch. Thanks, but I think we're gonna go with plan "B". What's plan "B"? - The Factory. - Factory? It's our favorite bakery. Cookies that melt in your mouth, right? Want to go for a walk? Can I get two cookies? One. Can Hailey come? Do you want to come? Or would you rather... try one of these guys instead? That's a tough call. I think I'll go with plan "B", Emmy, I think she's pretty smart. Are you married? No. Emmy... why don't you go get your jacket? Sorry about that. She can sometimes be a bit precocious. No, precocious is a good thing. Means she'll probably get what she wants out of life. The only rule is... you can't eat it all in one bite. Okay. Told you. No, I mean, seriously. I mean, this is the best cookie I've ever had. Can I have another, Daddy? You already ate it? We had an agreement, remember? Okay. Can I go and check out the toy store, then? As long as I can see you. You two take your time. See you in a little bit. What? Nothing. No, come on. Tell me. She's just watched too many old-school Full House episodes. I don't get it. The dad on that show, his daughters are always trying to set him up. Let's just say she likes you. That's because I'm a dog lady or, even worse, a puppy lady. Maybe. It's just been hard for her to understand that's not my focus. You know, between my job and raising her, lots to juggle. Essentially, I'm not sure what a social life is anymore. I know exactly what you mean. I feel like I'm in the same boat. I mean, we have the puppy parties, then I work with my dad during the week, and then I have the new puppies at home. I feel like I never have a moment to myself. Yeah. Anyway, you've made an impression, hence the Boojelly ploy. Wasn't left by accident. Take it as a compliment. She's very particular. Okay, I will. You have... No, on the other side. Awesome. Chocolate, frosting, ice cream, dog hair... I can't leave my house without something on me somewhere. You host puppy parties, you're bound to end up with at least one or the other. Yeah. That reminds me. I meant to bring a petition to your house yesterday. I'm hoping to build a dog park at the Bryant Street land. The... The petition? Yeah. Wait. Have you heard about it? I have, in fact. I was thinking that if I could get a thousand signatures, then maybe I can convince city hall to build a dog park instead of another strip mall. Do you think that'll be enough? Well, I don't know. I mean, I hope. I've been working really hard. I've called city hall, trying to get a meeting with anyone over there, especially that lug-headed city planner. "Lug-headed"? He's just afraid that if he doesn't give the Mayor and his cronies what they want, then he'll lose his job. Cronies, huh? Yeah. Well, anyway, maybe you could bring it to your office, get some people to sign the petition. We're really, really, really close. What are you guys talking about? Dogs and puppies? We are, actually. Wait! For your office party? My office party? Yeah! A puppy party would be so much fun. A puppy party... at my office party. Yeah! Like I did. Yeah, we do office parties all the time. What's the occasion? Our new offices. Everyone will love it. I don't know about that. Besides, it's in a few days. Well, we do last-minute very well, and besides, it's for a really good cause that needs more awareness. Awareness. Well, that's true. The puppies are just bait. Our real goal is to find homes for all of our rescue dogs. All right... All right! Okay. These cookies are amazing. They are. I see you parked it there again. I'm so sorry, Fred. I... My business partner, she drove the van home, and I forgot to tell her to not park it on the street. I saw her bringing a gaggle of puppies into the house... again. Well, I'm fostering a stray who had puppies. Well, just get the van off the street, and don't let those puppies onto my lawn. Will do. Oh, dear. You're... you're home. Yeah. Hey, thanks for watching the puppies. Anytime. Why are you so late? Emmy and Ryan invited me downtown to get some cookies. Do tell. Nothing to tell. I knew it! Knew what? He's into you. You're reading into this. He invited you to dessert. Emmy asked me for dessert. Small details. Okay, you know what? Good night. A handsome widower with a fantastic daughter? He's a catch. Let's just hope he's employed. Well, fortunately for us, he is. We're doing a puppy party at his office party this Saturday. Okay, then. Sorry about the ice cream. - I was hungry. - Okay. OK, stop. This is it. Are you sure? Because... ...This is City Hall? - Hi. - Hi. So you work at City Hall? Yep. I'm the lug-headed city planner. That is not fair. Fair is exactly what I want to be. You deserve a chance to speak with the Mayor and explain to everyone why you feel the dogs in our community are in need of a big open park. Which you're against? Not so much against, but I am in favor of the retail development. Okay, so why have me come here? Because this is your city hall as much as it is mine... and fair is fair. All right. Well, I have to warn you, puppies are very persuasive. Advantage Hailey. Okay, so where should I set up? Come on, I'll show you around. Sorry! Gotcha. There you are. I just want to be sure. They are all potty-trained, right? Yeah, I think so, for the most part. Which part? I think he likes you. You want to hold him? No, I'm not really a dog person. I mean, he will grow into a dog eventually. Yes, but he doesn't know that yet, so... I suppose. He is kind of cute, isn't he? Yes, he is. Although sometimes cats are a better choice. I mean, it's hard to become a dog person if you're not yet, you know? There are dog people, there are cat people. The two rarely mix. Bad, bad mix. Well, I think I could be persuaded with that face. Excuse me. She's a cat person. Hailey, have you met Mayor Betz? No, but I've been hoping to. Well, I appreciate that. So what do you think of our new City Hall? It's very impressive, and the puppies love it, too. They're really cute, aren't they? It's hard to say no to puppies, right? Especially when it comes to a big open dog park. Dog park? Yeah. Hailey's the one who started the petition to turn the Bryant Street land into a dog park. Of course. But we have a dog park already, don't we? You know, there is one, but it's really small, and what we could really use is just a big open space so the dogs to roam around freely, and the Bryant Street land is the perfect spot for it. Right. Well, thank you for voicing your opinion on that, but tonight we are all here to celebrate our new city hall, so if you'll excuse me? He can be a bit headstrong. It's nothing I can't handle. I just need to do some more digging. Digging? Is that what you do in your spare time? I'm an accountant, so I just mean I... Digging into numbers, that's kind of what I do best. Accountant? Impressive. So says my dad. Dog on the loose. I'll... I'll be right back. Just... okay. Oh, no, you don't! Stop it! One of the puppies found my golf clubs? Close! Golf shoes. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to snoop. This is a... a really nice photo. Emmy's mom? Yeah. She was really beautiful. She was. I... heard a couple of the moms at Emmy's birthday party talking about how she'd passed on. That's how I knew. Five years ago, cancer. Emmy was just three. Still remembers her. That must have been very hard. Was. Sometimes still is... But Emmy and I are a tight little team, and you only know what you know, right? So Emmy knew life with her amazing, beautiful mom... and now she knows life with just me. Well, that's a really great way to look at life. It's the only way to look at life. Life's... what's right in front of you. It's the now, the present, even if it is complicated. Which life always is. Okay... And I wanted to thank you... for introducing me to the mayor, even though I'm still hoping for... for a more official meeting. Of course. I thought an introduction would help. Even though you're against the dog park? Even though I'm in favor of the retail project, yes. Hi there. Thank you so much, Ryan. Everyone is having a really great time. It sure looks like it, but thank Emmy and Hailey. They're the ones that talked me into it. No! My new rug! I'm so mortified. Come on! Everyone thought it was funny. Not the Mayor, especially if he was showing off his very expensive rug. Mayor Betz shows off everything he has to everyone. I wouldn't be surprised if Ryan never speaks to me again, and now they're never gonna consider the dog park. It'll be fine. At least now you know who you need to lobby. Yeah, okay. I got to go! Talk about juggling a lot! Look at you! I actually consider myself a master. Here, let me take something. Hi... Hi. You actually just caught me finishing lunch with some colleagues, who are still talking about the party. Not the Mayor, I hope. No, but he did appreciate the gift card for the rug cleaning. Well... the least I could do. We all had a pretty good laugh about it. Even the mayor, eventually. No one's ever gonna take the petition seriously now, though, are they? I can't say for certain. I wish I could. I don't understand why this city needs another strip mall. Just like you, there's a need for this retail space. One of the tenants is going to be "Tot Drop", which is affordable daycare a lot of the people in this area could use. There's also going be a music store, which has agreed to offer free music lessons to kids who buy instruments. Advantage Ryan. Have you researched any other vacant lots where you could build a dog park? There is this one place, but we just... we don't have the funding. The Bryant Street land was allocated by the city, so it was funded by the city. Which would require tax revenue to pay for it. Are you aware that the EPA requires that every municipality dedicate a certain amount of protected wetlands per square acreage? Yes, I am. A dog park would qualify. You've done your research. I have. Check the water table. I will. Okay. So how's Emmy? Perusing your website any chance she gets. Still plotting then, huh? Always. In fact... You want to bring her over to see the dogs sometime? She's been begging me. She would go binoculars if she knew I got to see them today without her. Well, I'll give you my address, then. So I'll see you... This weekend? Perfect. Perfect. You got to... Yeah. Okay, I'll see you this weekend. Bye, puppies. - Here. - Yep, I can get that. All right. See you later. Yeah. Bye. Okay. Hey, out of the dirt! Let's go. You're honestly gonna lobby me about this dog park after what happened to my rug? It came out, didn't it? That's not the point! It's the principle. Besides... I told you, we've got a lot riding on this Bryant Street. You know, along comes Puppy Party lady, and suddenly you change your mind. I haven't changed my mind. In the end, it's up to you and the city council. I'm just saying... she has a point. A dog park would be good for you, too, you know. How? Mark, you're the Mayor. You're an elected official. Do I need to elaborate? Big business and tax revenue are fine, and again, I do think the Bryant Street project is a good idea, but you need to reach out to the rest of your constituents a little more. Like Hailey, right? Like Hailey and a lot of other people. Hey, you're going to bat for this dog park for a reason. I like dogs. You like her. You like her, right? It's a slam dunk, buddy. Time to get back into the dating game... but no promises on the dog park, okay? Bryant Street has to stay on track. Take that. Okay, you guys. Give your mama a break. Hey! Stay. - Hi! - Hi. Are you here to see the puppies? My dad's just on a call in the car. Okay. Well, the puppies are right in there. Also, I heard him talking on the phone about you. Really? Well, what did he say? Not sure, but he was talking about you. You know, you're pretty funny. Who's that? That's me, and that was my mom. Where's your mom now? She's not around anymore. She passed a few years ago. Mine too. Want to go see some puppies? Oh, my gosh. Hashtag "cute"! Did my eight-year old just use "hashtag" in a sentence? She definitely did. Do they have names yet? No, I decided not to name them, but you see how they have different-colored collars? That's how I tell them apart. See, this guy right here, his name is Mr. Orange. He looks like an otter when he lays on his back. That's so funny. I thought the very same thing. Hey, what do you think of the name "Otter"? I like it a lot. "Otter" it is. He is really special. How come? Well, he won't eat his dog food, he refuses to, so I've had to feed him with a bottle. He's so big. That's 'cause he's still getting his nutrients, but it's time this little guy gets off the bottle. Can I try? Yeah, sure. Why not? Ho, ho, ho. Here you go. Come on, Otter. Try it. Hey, it looks like someone has a new best friend. I see what's going on already. I think I just got cornered. Yeah, you definitely did. So should I put him on hold for you? I don't think we're ready yet. It wouldn't be fair to any of us, including Otter there. Well, you know, when Mia wandered into my backyard, pregnant, I thought there was no way I could handle that responsibility, but turns out she rescued me more than the other way around. Especially after my mom passed. It's something to think about. And he should eat his kibble right up, but make sure you feed it from your hand, not the bowl. He isn't ready for that yet. Aye-aye, Captain. I'll see you soon, Otter. Be a good boy. Thanks, Hailey. Thank you, Emmy. This made her day... Her week! Well, month, really. I don't think I've seen her this happy in a long time. Dogs do that to people. Man and girl's best friend. I know, and while I might not be ready to commit... to a puppy, maybe there's a compromise. A compromise? Maybe Emmy can come around once in a while and help out with the dogs, or even work at your next puppy party. I've been looking to give her some responsibility, and I think this might be it. I think that would be awesome. I'd have to come with her, of course. So I'd have to see you again? You'd have to see me again. I think I can handle that. I'll call you. I'll answer. Okay. Bye. Bye. You're so cute. You come up with anything? No, not yet. No tax breaks that will mean anything to the city, and Ryan seems like he wants to help, but it's just I have to come up with something more concrete that he can work with. Well, even if you do, do you think he'll still be able to bend the Mayor's ear? I don't know. Keep digging, honey. I'm sure you'll find something. Okay, so... I'm so glad you guys could help me today. I really want to show you this cool place. So this is it. What do you think? It's amazing. Yeah, it's my own little private sanctuary for all of the rescue dogs. It's 10 acres, so the dogs love to run outside without a leash, and they love being in here. Sometimes, I set up obstacle courses and things like that. It's just amazing. How are you able to use it? My dad, one of his clients, he knows the company who owns it, and they're not using it, so they don't mind. Okay, so I'm gonna ask the obvious question... wouldn't this make a much better dog park than the Bryant Street land? Yes, it will make the most amazing dog park, and I think about that all the time. I mean, if I had this land, I would make it way more than a dog park. I'd make it a sanctuary. I mean, can you imagine all of those dogs that are just sitting in cages in the shelter? If I made this whole thing into a sanctuary where they could live, and then they'd have 10 acres to just roam around in? And? It's just... The company, they're owned by a bigger corporation, and so their intention is, at some point, to sell it to the highest bidder. I take it you've already made your plea with them. Yes, I have, about a million times. Short of buying it for a million dollars, the answer is a resounding no. So... that's kind of why I was hoping that the Bryant Street land would be made into a dog park. Because that land's owned by the city, and we can do whatever we want with it. That's what I was thinking, yeah. Look, Daddy! - The puppies remember me. - I can see that. You know, resistance is futile. It's starting to seem that way. Hey, do you think that you could bring them in the living room to their momma? You think you can handle it? Yes. Come on. Let's go. Thank you. Oh, my goodness... How soon do you think they'll be adopted? Pretty soon, especially after the next party. I mean, people already can put them on hold if they want. Yeah... I bet they do. I just don't want to let Emmy down. Yeah. Listen, the only thing worse than an animal not getting adopted is if someone brings them home when they're not really willing to commit. It's just... the animals normally get brought back to the shelter. I don't think there's any chance of an animal in our house being neglected. Yeah, definitely not. It's just, you know, I wouldn't want Emmy to get too attached to Otter if the answer's still gonna be no for a while. It'll just make things harder on her. Things can change. Really? Maybe things already have. I just, I wouldn't want her to get her hopes up. It's a great thing you're doing, with the Puppy Party Playdates, raising awareness and money for shelter dogs. It's pretty spectacular. Thanks. Well, you know, when you spend as much time as I do with dogs, you know what you learn? Is that they would just have such an amazing time if they had a big, wide-open space that they could roam around in, like a dog park. I don't really give up easily, you know. I can't imagine you would. And I'm not really an idealist, okay? I understand the practicality of what I'm asking for. Then you also know that I have to support what I think's best for the city. They're not greedy developers. They're not "cronies". There would be real benefits for a lot of people. Yeah, I understand your perspective... But would you mind if I just sent you the park renderings and proposal? Absolutely, but to be honest, I'm not sure it's going to do any good. Okay, well, I have to follow my heart on this one. As the saying goes, "follow your heart, because you never know where it might lead you". I... Hey there, Kel. What's up? Are you still going to the retirement party tonight? Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there. Would you mind giving me a ride? My car's acting so funny. Yeah, sure. I'll call when I'm on my way. You are the best. Bye. That was Kelly. Yeah. I... I saw that. One of our administrators is retiring. Lost track of time, and I have a babysitter coming. If it's helpful to you, I could watch Emmy. Thanks, but I hate to cancel on the sitter. Yeah, sure, of course. Emmy. We have to go, sweetie. Okay. Bye, Hailey. Bye. Bye, Otter! Bye... Bye. - Hi. - Hey, there. That was so much fun last night. - Thank you for bringing me. - You're welcome. Listen, I know you're busy, but I need some help with the Bryant Street development. How so? I just want to make sure we've covered our bases. I think I might've stumbled upon something... something Hailey said to me. Hailey, the puppy lady? Yes, that Hailey. Would you be able to look into our legal obligation for total citywide wetland requirements? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thank you. I'll be! So what are we doing out here? Walk with me. Hey, this is the land owned by the Farley Corporation, right? Didn't this come up on a possible development proposal? Yep. I see where you're going with this. You're thinking shopping... condos, beautiful little strip mall... right? Not quite. Mini-storage? Mayor... Must be serious. You called me "Mayor". Sanctuary. Sanctuary? For whom? They tend to walk on all fours and bark. Here, the dog park? Not just a dog park. A lot of rescue dogs never find a new home, and they never leave the shelter. This would guarantee them a place to live until they find a new home. You're selling me on this, why? As you know, we have a federally-mandated wetland requirement. Right. I took a look at the water tables. This land qualifies. It should've been designated a long time ago, but it wasn't. Because it's private land. The Farley Corporation has always had an intention to sell it. Listen, Ryan, there's other land that we can designate as wetland. Mark, come on. This takes the pressure off Bryant Street. The city gets what it wants there, Hailey gets what she wants here. Okay, are there any legal ramifications? City council approval, your signature... I've already spoken to a representative at Farley Corporation. They weren't aware. I see you've done your homework. I want to do it right, one step at a time. Here is Mr. Hennessy's corporate, ready for him to look over and sign. That was quick. - He'll be very impressed. - Yeah. Especially when he sees how much money we're gonna save him. Hi. Did I get you at a good time or a bad time? A good time. Can you get away for a few minutes? I want to show you something. Yeah, sure. Where? Someplace that just might make you smile. I could have put this in an email, but I wanted to show you in person. Okay. What does this city need more... new retail space offering music lessons, daycare, convenient medical, or... a community park where people can let their dogs run free, and maybe even a sanctuary for rescue? Come on. - Is that a trick question? - The trick... is how does our city council decide between a non-revenue project or a highly-lucrative development? Well... we could give them all puppies. Not bad, but I think I found something. Both! What? I don't understand. You're the one who said it. Our municipality is required by law to maintain a certain amount of designated wetland within the city limits. The people who own this land, they plan on selling to a developer, right? Houses, retail? Yeah, exactly. Except... this land was designated as wetland a decade ago. It can't be developed. They just don't know it yet. Yeah, okay, so what does that mean, then? I mean, how can you turn it into a dog sanctuary? It means the land's worth a lot less than they thought. They'll want to dump it. Do you think the city would actually approve an animal sanctuary? I don't see why not. I... I don't know what to say. You'll have to come up with the funds to buy the land and turn it into a sanctuary, so now we have that hurdle... But you're telling me that it's possible? Yeah. Thank you! Are you... Are you gonna get that? Yeah. It's just... It's actually an alarm. I have to go check on the puppies. Hey, do you want to come with me? I could get you a dozen cookies from The Factory? How can a guy say no to that? Well, hopefully, he doesn't. You never said anything about grooming them. You didn't ask for details. Classic bait-and-switch. You know what? I will not tell Emmy that you were moonlighting without her again. There would be no forgiveness. So how did your retirement party go? Retirement party? It was fine. It was at McGary's, in town. Did Kelly get her car fixed? I'm not sure, but I'm guessing so. I just assumed you would know. You know, you two are close friends. Old friends that have become close friends. Who have dated? Dated? No! I mean, we've gone out for dinner a few times, but not like that. She was a close friend of Liz's, and after she died, Kelly really helped me out, emotionally... and with Emmy. It's really remarkable that you do this. What, brush puppies? Rescue them. I don't really have a choice. Yes, you do, but you follow your heart, don't you? Well, you never know where it can lead. I'll be right back. All right. I'm in trouble. Hailey Goode? So this "Puppy Party Playdates", it's your business? You're running it out of your home? No, it's nothing like that. It's just I'm fostering a stray who wandered into my yard while she was pregnant, and then she had the puppies, so now I'm fostering both. Right. Well, there's been a complaint from one of your neighbors, who brought it to the attention of the city administrators. A complaint? Business vehicle parked on the street, a number of dogs being brought in and out of the house. Do you have a license? She doesn't need a license to foster animals. Well, no, but there is a city ordinance that stipulates a maximum of three dogs per household, and if it's part of her business, then she's in violation of the law. I'm sorry. Oh, come on, you're kidding. Is there anyone I can talk to? City Hall? There are no exceptions. The business isn't run out of my house. We do the parties at other people's homes and parks. Yet you're breeding dogs out of the home for this business? No, no. I'm not breeding dogs. Mia is a rescue. She was pregnant when I found her. Did you obtain a dog license for her? No. I meant to. I really did. I just... I forgot. You're aware there's a city ordinance, maximum three dogs? Yes. Puppies are exempt. Up to a certain age. Janice, she's not doing anything illegal. Perhaps not intentionally, but the business and residential address are one and the same, and now dogs in that home are being used for that business. Business vehicles are being parked on the street. Look, it's only until I can get the puppies adopted. There have already been several complaints from your neighbors. "Neighbors" plural or neighbor singular? Listen, Fred complains when someone flushes the toilet. That may be, but at this point, it's a matter of the law, and the law is quite clear. I'm sorry. What's your dog's name? Excuse me? The photo. Abby. She died a few months ago. I'm so sorry. But my point is, you're a dog person. Right? I can tell. Very much so. Well, what would you do if Abby... Ms. Goode, my love for animals has no bearing on whether or not you can run a business out of your home or foster too many pets. It may be very well-intended, but at this point, you're in violation of several city codes. Puppy Party Playdates must cease and desist immediately. Thanks, Janice. Janice is one of those people who'll reject a permit if an "i" isn't dotted correctly. Well, is there anyone else we can talk to? There might be. - Who? - Kelly. She's the city attorney and reports to the mayor. She knows Janice well. If anyone can find a crack in her armor, it's Kelly. Okay, well, let's call her to set up a meeting. Okay. So she's agreed on a compromise. Puppy Party Playdates will retain its license, but the dogs must be removed from the house. She then wants proof that the puppies have been adopted or sent to the shelter, certified by new owners. Can't we fight this? Of course, but do you really want to? She can permanently revoke your business license. Not that it will stick, but it'll be a hassle trying to get that back. There's just no way we're gonna get the dogs adopted that quickly. What about the shelter? I already called so many, and just like every other shelter in the state, they're full, and besides, Ryan, I don't want them in a shelter anyway. They need to feel loved, not alone. Well... bring them to my house. You're not allowed to operate a business from your house, either, Ryan. I'm not operating a business from my house. The ordinance still applies... too many dogs. It'll get Janice off her back long enough until the next party, gives the puppies a place to live until they find their own homes, and keeps Hailey's Puppy Party Playdates in operation, which helps find those homes. We just have to make sure the puppies get adopted quickly. Are you sure about this? Not entirely, but I know a certain little girl who'll be very happy about it. Okay, no peeking. Okay, sweetie. You can open them now. Did we adopt them all? No. We're just watching them for a little while until the next party. I hope there's never another puppy party ever. How can I say no now? Hey, it's good practice. When is the next party? That would be next weekend. It's my friend's engagement party. She should only be attached to all of them by then. Sure you won't get in trouble with City Hall for this? I don't think so. Nobody needs to know. Just glad I could help out. Me too. Come here. Would you like to stay for dinner? Sure. There's a great noodle shop down the street. I'll go pick it up. Okay. I'll stay here and watch Emmy and the rest of the gang. Be back in a few. Okay. Are you so excited? Do you think my dad will ever let me keep Otter? I think he's close. I think your dad just wants to make sure that you'll hold up your end of the bargain. What's a bargain? A bargain is... an agreement. Like the other day, when your dad said you could only have one cookie. That's a bargain. He just wants to make sure he's not the only one who's taking care of Otter. Can anyone adopt Otter? Well, someone could... but I find it usually works the other way around. What do you mean? Well, think about Mia, right? She's a sweet, amazing dog, and I have no idea where she came from, but she didn't have a home, and at first, I thought something was wrong with her, but do you know why Mia was alone for so long? Because... she hadn't chosen anyone. You know, dogs are very smart, and they're picky, and she turned down all the other offers because she wanted to be with me. Do you think there's a way to convince my dad that I'll live up to my end of the bargain? I have an idea. Do you have paper and markers? Okay. What are you two up to? Emmy and I have been working on something together, so please have a seat. Okay. My name is Emmy, and I'm here to present to you the five criteria someone should have before a rescue dog picks them to be their new best friend. First... Kindness. I'm very kind to everyone, especially to puppies, and especially to Otter. Even when he grows up, I'll always be nice to him. Next... smarts. I'm really good at school, which means I'll be able to learn all about how to care for a new puppy, and I'm going train him to sit, to stay, and to not chew my daddy's shoes. Fun... We are going to have so much fun together. I'm going to take him on walks every day and throw him a ball anytime he wants. Finally, love... I'm going to love him more than anything in the world, except my dad, and that's why I want to get a puppy and why I'll live up to my end of the bargain. Thank you. I knew I shouldn't have left you two alone. I found it very persuasive. I bet you did. So did I. I'll tell you what. Having these puppies here with us for a few days will be a good test. It's a lot of work, lots of responsibility... If you can show me you can handle it, I'll be inclined to say yes. Thank you, Daddy. Did you really like it, Daddy? It was great. You know... us not getting a dog isn't because I think you wouldn't take great care of him. I know you would. This might sound silly, but it's just been me and you for a while, and maybe there's a part of me that just doesn't want to share you with anyone else. But maybe it's time our family gets bigger. I think it is, and I think Otter would make a great addition. He will. Maybe Hailey, too. What makes you say that? Because! She's smart and nice. She makes you smile, Daddy. I love you, sweetie. I love you, too. And she's out. Puppies are, too. Really? Yeah. I mean, at this age, that's kind of all they do, really. That was a sweet thing you did with Emmy... the presentation. I hope I didn't put you on the spot. Sometimes, I need a little push to make me realize that I might be missing out on a moment. Well, moments can pass you by if you don't recognize them. That's true. Wait. Where'd Otter go? I have a pretty good idea. Okay. It's okay, Otter. I'm right here. Come on. You can sleep with me tonight. It's getting late, so I should probably go. Hey, maybe Emmy can help me at my next party. Yeah. I'd have to chaperone her, of course. Yeah, of course. I'll, I'll send you the info. - Great. - Great. Thanks for this today. No, thank you. Bye. Goodnight. Who knew setting up an engagement party would be so much work? Every bride who ever got married? Well, I wouldn't know, but maybe this afternoon, some of these dogs will find their forever home, and I'll find my future husband. Okay, maybe you will. Speaking of future husbands, how is our smoke-show dad? Would you stop calling him that? He is a catch, Hailey. I mean, the man is going out of his way for you. With the puppies. I know. But he insisted. Well, I think it's noble. I mean, these dogs have nowhere to go. The shelters are full. They'd be homeless. I know. He's so perfect. A perfect match for you, that is. Okay. I like him, Dana. I like him a lot... so much, it scares me sometimes. Look, I know you've had your heart broken before, but you can't keep living in the past. Yeah, I know, but I just, I don't really know if he's ready for a relationship, you know? He's been through a lot with the loss, and now he's a single dad, and his life is really full. You just spent an entire day with a man and his daughter. From what you tell me, it sounds like his life wouldn't be full without you in it. Okay, we have three hours until the party. You, my friend, need to get home. Our Puppy Party Playdates shirts are officially banned from this afternoon's festivities. You're getting your hair up, dress on, best paw forward. - Let's go! - Okay. You are so cute. You're adorable. And all available, as well as the many adult dogs we have in the back. I was just gonna take a tour in the back room. Thanks so much. No problem. Don't you look dapper. Thank you. Where's Hailey? I haven't seen her yet. She's around here somewhere. There she is. What? You... you look great. Thanks. So I'm gonna go check to see how Emmy's doing with the puppies. Yeah. So how's it going? Any takers? Going to be like fish in a barrel. I hope so. Hey, Dad. What are you doing here? Well, I am friends with the cute couple, aren't I? I also happen to be friends with the bride's grandfather. There he is. Fred? Hi! I... I didn't realize you were Katie's granddad. Well, now you do. Well... I'm gonna go get myself a lemonade. What was that all about? He's the one who called the city on my business. Fred? That old grump. I'll have to have a talk with him. Thanks. You must be Ryan? I am. Nice to meet you, Mr. Goode. - Call me Wade. - All right. Ryan, what's the difference between an accountant and a lawyer? Dad... I don't know. An accountant knows he's boring. I'll go talk to Fred. Okay. Thanks, Dad. Ryan, see you again, I hope. Yeah. He really likes you. How do you know? He only tells really bad jokes to people he likes. Then he must really like me. I think you're his favorite. Come on, this way. Hi. What's your name? - Roxanne. - Hello, Roxanne. I'm Mr. Blue, and I've been looking all over for you. All of the adoptions are done through this animal shelter with Dana, and they'll contact you. You'll fill out all the forms, they'll do an interview, and if they think that you're a suitable forever home, then you get to take the dog home with you. Great. Can I go see him in the back? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Hi. The puppies are going fast. We need to initiate "Operation Otter" before someone snatches him up. "Operation Otter"? My dad has basically said yes to Otter already, but I just need to push him over the top. So... "Mickey Mouse". What's that? A person we need to make up that's looking for a new puppy. That's a really good idea, but maybe we should go with a name that's a little less suspicious. "Amber Dunlap", then. She's my best friend in school. Yep, that's much less suspicious. Here you go. All right. "Operation Amber Dunlap", aka "Mickey Mouse", is underway. You ready? Your dad's over there. Let's call him over. Daddy! What's up? Look. Someone wants to adopt Otter. Come on. Yeah, well, you know I can't protect him. Unless I agree right here and now to adopt him. Is that correct? I'm afraid so. Daddy... I'm thinking. All right. - Is that a yes? - Yes. Thank you, Daddy! So what's the next step? You just have to fill out the adoption forms, because, you know, otherwise, this Amber Dunlap's gonna beat you to it. Done and done. Can I go tell Otter? Of course. Thank you. Yeah, well, you know, I knew all the dogs were gonna go really fast. Amber Dunlap, huh? She was really serious. Maybe I should talk to her, just to let her know the situation. You know, I think she left. - Right. - She was just... She was coming after Otter, though, any minute. Yeah? She's a "YouTuber". You know, don't pay attention to that. No? She likes you. I'm sure she's that way with everyone. I haven't seen her that way with anyone. How long's she been in the shelter? Over a year. She was treated poorly by negligent owners and called in by a concerned neighbor. Anyhow, we nursed her back to health, and now she's desperately looking for a home. You think maybe I could take her for a walk tomorrow? Absolutely. Here you go. Thanks. Have a good night. Hey. Where are Emmy and Dana? Dana offered to take Emmy home. She could hardly keep her eyes open. She also suggested I stay and help you clean up. Oh, she did, did she? They both did, actually. Need some help? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Quite the night. I think even your "friendly" neighbor found a soft spot in his heart. Yeah! I know, right? Who would've thought? So... good with dogs, but the real question is... Can you dance? Right now? You're too shy? Because you don't strike me as a shy type. Emmy's waiting. I guess... You should go. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Everything okay? Yeah. It's just... It's... It's nothing. Ryan? Yeah, I just... I don't know what it is. It's like one minute, you know, I feel like there's something there, and then the next minute, he's hesitant and distant. Which is natural, especially in his situation. Right. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Be patient with him. Whatcha working on? A new proposal to fund the dog sanctuary. If I can't figure out a way to buy this land, then I'm back to square one. It'll take more than just a fundraiser, won't it? Yeah, a lot more. Did the rest of the puppies get adopted? Almost. Dana's interviewing potential new owners now, so I should probably go help her. I'll be back this afternoon to finish the Lily returns, okay? I'm all covered here. Do what you need to do. Thanks, Dad. - Good morning, Hailey. - Good morning, Mr. Hennessy. Hey there, Dave. Everything all right with the returns? Of course. I actually wanted to pop by and chat with you about the grant I mentioned last time I was in. Yeah, right. Have a seat. Did you decide on a recipient for it yet? No, we haven't found the right fit yet. How did it work out for her with the signatures? Did they get the Bryant Street land? No, but something else actually opened up that's even better than Bryant Street... an animal sanctuary. All that's needed now is the funds to purchase the land. Is that so? Hey. Ry? Looks like you were deep in thought with something. I was just thinking. Does she know? Who? Hailey. What do you mean? I mean that you have feelings for her. I don't think that's going anywhere. You once told me that you never wanted to get serious with someone because of Emmy, that she was your everything. And she is my everything. Yeah... but that doesn't mean that she has to be your only everything, Ryan. - Go make her smile. - What's this? Just a little email that I received today. The animal sanctuary she's proposing? Looks like it got funded. Ha! So it's official? It's funded? All of it, and approved by the city. Hailey is gonna cry! This has been her dream for so long. We thought it'd be fun to surprise her and tell her here. Well, what did you have in mind? What else? A puppy party. Awesome. Wait, maybe you can tell her that you found a new client, with a last-minute request. All right. And Dana, you'll have to convince her to bring the puppies here, even though it's short notice. Good idea. And the barn here has really been a sanctuary to Hailey, in many ways. I think we should have her meet us there. Well, she's at the shelter, so I'll go there and wait for Wade's call. Got it. Great. Awesome! Congratulations. Happy home forever, little guy. Good luck with her. Thanks so much. Bye. Puppy Party Playdates, this is... Hi, Dad. A client? Well, how did you... Yeah, sure. Let me ask. Hey, Brad, do we happen to have a few puppies that we can use for a last-minute party? We do, we have two little ones left from Mia, plus I think we have about five more. Okay. Yeah, we can make that work. Today? At the barn? Yeah. Yeah, sure, that's fine. Dana and I will meet you over there. Okay. Sure. Bye. Hey, that is so weird. My dad just got a booking for us from a client, and they want us to meet them at the barn, of all places. We could do that, right? Yeah, I just... I didn't know anyone knew about that place. The Puppy Party Playdates shirts are in the wash, so we should just wear this. Wait, is that... A stain? That's a stain. Yeah, we should probably change, then. Better get going. I don't see a stain. Ryan? Emmy, Dad... What's going on? Miss Hailey Goode, may I present to you... ...Your new rescue sanctuary. Recipient of the Hennessy Grant. What? It's all completely funded. Congratulations, honey. I... I don't understand. I... Is this supposed to be some sort of joke? Please tell me this isn't a joke. It's not. The city's approved it. I can't believe it. There's something else. What? Something I want to tell you. Something I should have told you already. I'm all ears. So here it goes. If I were a singer, I would've put it in a song. If I were a writer, it'd be a poem... but I'm a city planner, and I present things to people in order to sway their opinion in my favor. So... You told me that we don't choose a rescue animal, they choose us... but in order for them to choose us, there's five things we need to possess. You're the kindest person I know. You would do anything for anyone without ever considering what's in it for yourself. You didn't start Puppy Party Playdates to make money. You did it to better the world... and people's lives... dogs' lives... and you have. Smarts... You have a successful part-time business that would be more than most people could handle full-time, and... you know the difference between melt-in-your-mouth cookies and ones that... don't. Fun. You have a sweet laugh and a beautiful smile. You find humor in almost everything, especially when it's needed most. It's infectious... and adorable. Honesty is hard to come by, and trust is hard, especially when you've experienced loss... especially when you have a daughter who means everything... but sometimes... you have to trust your heart more than anything. Follow your heart and you never know where it might lead you... And it's led me to this moment, this now, saying these words to someone who isn't complicated, just... perfect... And lastly, the person has to be loving, and I don't think there's anyone else in the whole world with more love to give than you... And it's because of that, I wouldn't want to be rescued by anyone else. Me neither. It might be too much, too soon, but... I'm gonna go out on a limb here, live in the now, the present, and say... I think I've fallen in love with you, Hailey Goode. Well... that's good, because I think I've fallen in love with you, Ryan Hill. You should probably kiss me again, just to be sure.
