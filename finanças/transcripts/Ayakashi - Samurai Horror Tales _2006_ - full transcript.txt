I get it now. The "Truth" of the Goblin Cat was you all along! I understand. You are the "Truth" behind the Goblin Cat. Tell me the story. What difference would that make? What do you mean? The beast can't be held back anymore. Soon I will be killed by it. I don't care whether or not you are killed. The fact is that I have to cut the beast down. To do this I must know your story! Tell me! You are the creator of the beast. You have an obligation to talk! Obligation? I was merely looking to entertain myself. Being thoughtless for my age, I was just going to scare her. The Final Act Yo, yo, at midnight evil spirits stalk As if they're from another world Come to rhyme rhymes Can you hear them? The sounds resonating from the darkness Scared senseless, but you pretend not to be interested Your curiosity grows day by day So let's go check them out, here we, here we go ya'll The mysterious and dangerous evil spirits Hell is probably full with evil spirits Those that can't get in march in a line Waiting on stand-by in this world There aren't any spaces left for them No wonder, no matter what the season is, it's always hot Purposely heating you up with hot verses That make you sweat You might as well let us hear you all sing! HA! It's just like a scene of a fire The excitement in the air heats up this island country DANGER! The tension keeps building COME ON! (This Japan is about to explode!) HA! It's just like a scene of a fire The excitement in the air heats up this island country DANGER! The tension keeps building COME ON! (This Japan is about to explode!) If the girl... If Tamaki... - Please don't take her! - Have mercy! If she had screamed... She hardly put up a fight. It was as though... She leaned in toward me. Even if I had sent her home, it would not have gone well for her. So I dressed her in lavish kimonos and fed her the finest foods. It was the least I could do. I had believed that our days would go on forever. I took her in the prime of her life. I can only imagine her regret and remorse. So you're suggesting that the girl's grudge possessed the cat and became the Goblin Cat? - Incredible... - Elder master... It's likely that her spirit couldn't bear to see a bride leaving this household. And of course a woman's grudge is incorrigible indeed. You say it like it doesn't concern you! You bastard! Bastard? I only did what I was told! I did nothing wrong! Nothing wrong at all! Everybody was using me for their own convenience! You figured I'd do anything I was told! You abused your authority! That's so cruel! Cruel! Cruel! Cruel! Cruel! Cruel! Cruel! Master Odajima! Yes! What is it?! What's missing?! Elder master! - Is it the "Truth?" - Ms. Sato! Ms. Sato! - Ms. Sato! - You're making a fool of me! - Ms. Sato! - They're all making a fool of me... - Let's go! - Making a fool of me...! Master Sasaoka, open the door! Please open the door! Master Yoshikuni! Master Yoshikuni! Yoshikuni! Yoshikuni! Yoshikuni! Yoshikuni! You're always mocking me with those eyes! You're going to hell, that's for sure! Yoshikuni! Kayo! I'm coming...! - You...! - Elder master...! You are going to protect me. The "Reasoning" of humans and the "Reasoning" of demonic spirits are entirely different. I beg you! I beg you! Please! I beg you! I beg you! Please! Please! Do something! If Odajima is asking for my help, I have no choice. With the "Truth" and "Reasoning"... This sword... shall be released! What?! Is this... Something you are showing me? This is how it should be! You should all die! There, there... There, there... Kitty, kitty... Good boy... Good boy. No! Help me! This is the past. Please show us the story to the end. I come here after a long absence and I see that they have made themselves a den. If you're not going to eat, I won't bring you any more. Keeping you alive isn't free. Kitty? Oh, right. Well, well. So you suddenly decided to eat. You certainly are disgusting. Eat some more. Kitty... Kitty... There, there... Eat all you want. There, there... Good boy. Good boy. Don't make any noise. Father's been wondering what to do with you lately. Poor girl. - Kitty, kitty. Good boy. - Kitty, kitty. Good boy. - You may be... - You stay there... -...dead soon... Yoshikuni! Father! When did you do this? A lowly, country girl seducing my son! It sickens me! It's inexcusable! Inexcusable! Inexcusable! Inexcusable! Inexcusable! What are you trying to do?! You lowly beast! Run - Hold it! - Run to the outside world. Kitty, kitty run... My sweet, sweet kitty, kitty. You must live on your own. Good-bye. Allow me, Sasaoka, to take care of the rest. Goblin Cat... Your "Truth" and "Reasoning" I have taken to heart. With your "Truth" and your "Reasoning" I release the sword! Release! I understand what you're capable of as I've seen you in action. It will not work against me. You are not destined to belong in this dimension. I will exorcise you! Forgive me! Vanish! The colors of flowers that are embedded in the sky My love that changes shape Eventually even when I have to let go of all I will only think of you On a random spring eve We exchanged our first kiss Wrapped in a dreamlike state I will only think of you Entrusting all that I am to you I will finally lay to rest I don't think he'd want to be laid to rest in this house. Better to lay him next to Tamaki. I hope he can be happy with Tamaki this time. This house has come to an end. All that I've protected for years, everything... I wasn't deceiving you I've told you the truth. You're right, this is your "Truth." You've been protecting it. You should take a good look. What will you do now? Where are you headed? That's not something you should be asking me. That's something you should be asking yourself, Master Odajima. I... I think I'll go back to my parent's home. I can't stay here any longer. As for me... No. I'm not trying to suggest anything. No one has the right to restrain or order another around. Hey! Medicine peddler! What happened to the wedding today? Over here... Over here... Kitty... Kitty... This way. This way... This way... I noticed that nobody's left for a while now. Perhaps. The End
