"You're naked but they keep stripping you. Strip me from my identity and my fate." "After renaming you, they left you among strangers and those to who you could never explain who you were." Identity / Milan Kundera Who? Anybody out there? Can you hear me? Where am I? Can you hear me? Be quiet, won't you? I have enough of a headache. Who's that? Do you know why I'm here? Who locked me up? Just shut the hell up. Complaining won't help. They can come back at any time. Who's "they"? The doctor and the nurses. I'm sick? I don't remember anything. Listen, your name is Anne. Anne? How do you know my name? You can't even see me. Have we met before? I know you're Anne. What's going on? Shut up! What's happening to me? What's going on? Nurse, did you see that? My face… Tell me who I am! Your name is Anne. You're sick and you're hallucinating. You need medical treatment. It's impossible. How could a person's face suddenly change? Relax. Have a good rest. The doctor will see you soon. No one knows if you're the real Anne. But I know that nurse is a liar. Because she also told me my name is Anne. Is… my name really Anne? This place doesn't look like a hospital. Do you know how long they'll keep us here? Until we all die. What do you mean? There's a demon called Vetigo. What? It will come out at night to hunt us down. A monster with the head of a deer. You mean, like the one in the video game? But that thing lives in the woods, doesn't it? Well… We're probably in the woods right now. Let's see… Anne, right? Shall we talk? Why am I here? You're here because you don't remember who you are. But that's okay. You're not the only one. We have several patients with the same condition. Our records show that your name is Anne. Is it? It doesn't sound like my name at all. Of course, you shouldn't always believe what people tell you. What your name is isn't as important as who you are. That's why I'm here to help you. But you have to cooperate. So we can dig inside your subconscious. What are you doing? Hypnotizing me? To know who you are, you have to find out for yourself. Try to remember where you came from. Empty your mind, Anne. Focus on the first image that flashes into your head. How am I supposed to feel when my face has changed? I don't even know which one is really mine. The question is, has your face actually changed? Stop biting your nails. Nails are delicate, you're going to ruin them. They'll get chipped off more and more. Let me go! The demon is coming to kill me! What do you want? We have to run. It's dangerous here. No. You're the girl I talked to earlier? Your voice sounds different. What? Are you crazy? I'm not going anywhere. Come on. It's coming this way. It's going to kill you! Who's coming? The deer demon! I'm not going. How do I know you're telling the truth? You're sick… just like me. You don't understand. You can't hide in there forever. Are you really going to watch it kill me? Just relax. It's horrifying, Doc. I don't want to be here anymore. But, Anne, you said when you came out of the room, there was no body, no blood. But I saw it with my own eyes. And that deer demon was trying to get into this room. It's the same as when you see your face constantly change. Mental insecurity plays tricks with your imagination and it makes you terrified and vulnerable. How long do I have to stay here? Soon you'll be out. You can't hide forever. When you find out who you are, you'll be let out. Empty your mind, Anne. And think of what you fear the most. And… Cut! Let's get out of here. We don't have much time. Who are you? Vetigo, the deer demon. It's coming. If you want to live, run now. Hey, trust me. Help me! Help! Help! Help! It's in the bathroom! I swear, it was in there. It tried to follow me out. What are you talking about? Vetigo, the deer demon. You mean it's real, this demon? I dreamed I already ran away from it. But it took me back. Forget your dream, we have to get out of here. Do you know how? Hold on… I'm Anne. You two are also Anne, right? What's going on? I'm confused. How many of us are here? Should we go check the other rooms? ASYLUM PATIENT RECORD Everyone's called "Anne." There must be a reason why they brought us here. Where are the rest of us? Who are you? You saw my face change, right? So it's not all in my head. They've been lying to us. My face changed before too. What are you guys talking about? It's coming. Let me go! Guys? Hey, wait for me! Guys? Where are you? Where's the other Anne? Who cares? Let's go check on her. This isn't the time to play the heroine. Help me! Help! Help! Help! This isn't the time to play the heroine. Help! Help! If I had ten faces like Ravana Ten faces I'd turn around and smile at you Ten tongues Ten mouths I'll leave you with Raving that I love you, love you Is the only voice If I had 20 eyes like Ravana Why do you have to kill… I was dreaming… Anybody out there? Where am I? Can you hear me? Be quiet, won't you? Complaining won't help. They can come back any time. Who's "they"? The doctor and the nurses. I'm sick? I don't remember anything. Listen, your name is Anne. Anne? How do you know my name? You can't even see me. Have we met before? I know you're Anne. All of us are Anne. Shut up! What's happening to me? Nurse, did you see that? My face… Shit. I was that girl next door? Let me go! The demon is coming to get me! Doctor, it's me. We met yesterday. I know I have a different face now. You and the nurses say my face hasn't changed. But it has! Calm down, we're on the same team. Don't you want to know who you are? Just tell me who I am. Look, that's you. First, you have to accept that the face you're seeing is you, whether you like it or not. But what we need to know is who you really are. That's why I have to hypnotize you. Because the subconscious never lies. Stop, please. Stop! What do you want? We have to run. It's dangerous here. No, I'm not going. You're the girl I talked to earlier? Your voice sounds different. This afternoon, you saw a cockroach coming out from behind the picture and you killed it, right? Then the psychiatrist came in and hypnotized you. Were you spying on me? I was you before. Huh? By midnight, all the staff will be gone. The last one to leave will be the nurse. Tonight I'll be dead. Tomorrow you will. If we do things differently, the consequences will also be different. It's the first night, so there's no Anne here. How do you know all of this? Have you been through this before? Yes, but I'll break the cycle. Or you'll have to repeat everything tomorrow. Three years ago? ASYLUM PATIENT RECORD That's mine. I'll unlock it for you. My fingerprint can unlock it. It's my phone. Who's this? Shit. Your face has changed. See, they lie to us. What for? I don't know. I've seen this guy before. You know him? No, I saw him during the hypnosis. You saw him too? Damn it, that doctor's messed up our minds. It's coming. Let's move. So this demon is real… If I go with you, you won't leave me behind? This time I won't. We need a weapon. If we do things differently, the consequences will also be different. Listen, go wait in there. I'll lure him here. Don't leave me. You're not a demon. You slept like a baby. What's wrong? I had the strangest dream. A nightmare. Maybe I've been playing video games too much. Don't worry. I'm here. Yeah, my hero. The sea doesn't look the same as when I came with my parents. You remember what it was like then? No, but I think it must have been better. I always wanted to come back here. After my parents divorced, my mom refused to come with me. Want to leave now? Let's stay a while longer. I feel at peace when I'm with you. Why is that? Because I can be my true self. Really? You're not always yourself? Will your mother yell at you? I don't give a shit. Easy. Don't say that. …while yesterday another group called Bad Students are planning some activities for Teacher's Day this year. The group will collect rattan canes, scissors and rulers, which teachers often use as tools of punishment, and gather them into a pile in front of the Ministry of Education as a demonstration of how students are being treated in the Thai education system. Can't you put that thing down for a minute? Next week we're going on vacation. You should have asked me if I wanted to go first. Let's go. Your doctor's appointment. That was some dream, wasn't it? You got to play so many characters. No. Dreaming about getting killed is no fun. But you keep coming back, just like in a game. A game with no rules. And you can never win. The girls you played in your dream, do you know where they're from? Are any of them from the real world? It's a shame. I don't know how to do hypnosis. It's not unusual, in fact. Nobody likes who they are. You're young. Your true self is still in flux, so you want to be someone else. First, you have to accept that the face you're seeing is you, -whether you like… -"Whether you like it or not." -That's gross. -Don't post it. I'll use my fake account to post it. No, not even on your fake shit. Only eight followers, bitch. You guys have fake accounts? Sure, who in the world doesn't? Don't play dumb, Anne. I bet you have tons of them. Bots, fakes and all. See this? -What? -A group for socialites. Posh. I'd rather do a role-play in a psycho patients' group. -Not for me. -You should try it. I look pale. Yeah, like a corpse. Shit, my period. Got a pad? No. Damn. Anne, don't forget to turn in the paper. Okay. What paper? She told me, not you. My name's Anne. Huh? My name's Anne too. Remember? Wait, you're both called Anne? Damn right. What's yours? How come she's forgotten my name? Shit. Not now. Anne, what's going on? Anne. Anne. Help me! It's in the bathroom! I swear, it was in there! It tried to follow me out. -What are you talking about? -Vetigo, the deer demon. So it's real, this demon? Never mind. Let's get out of here. You're coming? You two are also Anne, right? What's going on? I'm confused. How many of us here? Should we go check the other rooms? It's just us, trust me. Let's go to the nurses' room and look at the files. No need. I've got it. I was you before. What the hell… The same actions lead to the same consequences. Go straight to the ground floor. Wait up. Your face. This is completely insane! We need to calm down. Don't play dumb, Anne. I bet you have tons of fake accounts… I'm Anne. You both are Anne too, right? Your name's Anne. My name's Anne. We're all Anne. It's coming this way. Help me! Help me! This isn't the time to play the heroine. If we do things differently, the consequences will also be different. This isn't the time to play the heroine. -If we do things differently… -This isn't the time to play the heroine. So this room is real? All of us here are Anne? What are we exactly? We're Anne and we're not Anne. None of this is real. We're just avatars. What are you talking about? The Anne who was just killed was a profile photo of one of Anne's fake accounts. That means we're… No different from each other. Then who's the real Anne? Huh? Everyone wants to be the real Anne. Those who aren't chosen are of no use. Only the real Anne will get out of here. You're not a demon. You're just another Anne. We'll try again later. Hi, my little girl, I didn't forget. I have a patient in critical condition. I thought we would be together forever. I didn't want to go home. I wish I had a nice boyfriend. Is there anywhere I can be my true self? You're the first Anne who picked it up and read it. I've read it before. Have you? Do you remember where you read it? You read it or you wrote it? Is there anywhere I can be my true self? Let's use it in our session. Feel it. And let it take you back to where it came from. What's on your mind? The worst part of suicide is that when you fail you still have to live the life you didn't want. Students were arrested for protesting sexual harassment in schools. I don't even know what happiness is. I'm sick of life. It's torture. How many times do I have to kill myself in my head for it to be enough? Interesting. This time your face didn't change. Then why did you lie to me? Because you were not ready. Ready? Ready for what? If we do things differently, the consequences will also be different. Let go! Anthony? Only two of us left. Did you have to kill them all? There's no other way out of this? There can be only one Anne, the real Anne. And the real Anne is… you? That, you'll have to choose. Anne is not a demon, not like me. Kill me. I don't want to be Anne. No! You think now that there's only one Anne left that it's all over? So… all of this is your doing? No, it's Anne's. Anne created me based on her real-life psychiatrist. All of us were created from the images of people she likes, hates or wants to become. We are imprisoned in Anne's mind, condemned to wander her subconscious like lost spirits. We're her disposable souls. But why… Why did she create so many of us? The world is too frightening for a girl to be her true self all the time. I want to disappear from this world. Anne, the famous cosplayer, intentionally jumped from a building ending her life due to Internet bullying and harassment. We live without end in this half-dead body. Stop hiding behind our backs. Maybe… the only way out is by getting rid of us all.
