What does it say? "In the underground where the rose grows, the next word on the road lives." Rose...? We need to look for some... roses. Rose. Here, maybe. - Here. Hold it. - Okay. It seems to be stuck. Wait! Wait wait! Do not pull. These are rubber arrows. Fake! - Are you okay? - Yes. If anyone likes a trap, we should be close. "There, angry growls." Cool! "Garden until the door bears. Turn the cross and you are there." Cross? There are as many crosses as possible. - Do you see any garden? - No. - Look! Jump garden, of course! - Yes. But you don't see any... arrows, do you? That one, then. - You or me? - Do you drive. Okay. - It goes like a dance! - Good. Continue. Maja! Hello? Maja? Hi, answer, then! - Well, answer, then! - It is okay. Okay... Here! Take the rope! - Wow! - What?! Lasse? I think it's best that you come down here. - Huh? Do I have to? - Yes, you can! I'll help you! Okay. Continue. Good, Lasse. - Are you okay? Oh yeah. Now we continue. Cross! "Turn the cross and you're there." - What is that? - No clue. What a strange coffin. Are you in? Wait! "To open the coffin roof, only this small thing is required." "Find the key to its lock, otherwise the treasure will perish forever." - Signed by Alexander von Broms. - Alexander von Broms? - Hello Hello. - Already sold out. - I want to see Ricki Bee! - Of course you should, honey. - Daddy fixes it. - Yes, that's what Daddy does. - Oh, wait... - Dino, you're so cute. The coffin was hidden for over 250 years until Lasse and Maja found it. - What's in it? - Nobody knows. We can't open it. Alexander von Broms was not just a composer. He was a clever inventor too. He has also built our organ up here. Hello Hello. - Excuse me. - My little angels! Ticket sales are going great and I have a news: - Von Brom's duo should play here. - Relatives of Alexander von Broms? Yes. They were so happy about the coffin that they booked a concert for free. - How fun! Classical music! - Great fun... Fantastic! Gladest was Roland. He is completely in his favor to play with their idols. - The coffin has changed everything. - Yes. Now we can afford to renovate the church. Thanks to you, my little angels, are all problems of the world. We have a small problem here. Do you see the ceiling? It is fully penetrated. The jaw can collapse at any time. We have to change everything. It will cost a little extra. The wood, the guys' salary and my salary. Then we land on... something like this. - I need the money today. - I don't have that much money today. But the exhibition goes well, so in a month maybe... One month? Pay tomorrow otherwise we put the work down. It will be fine. Lasse and I can tell you how we found the coffin. - We can have guided display in the crypt. - My angels, do you want it? You're right. It will be alright. - Then we'll see where it can be. - I do not know. - Is that von Brom's duo? - Julia von Broms, I suppose? Yes, I am Julia von Broms. Roland Svensson. I'll accompany you is on Alexander von Brom's organ. Yes, we look forward to it. This is my son Richard. - Welcome. It is a great honor for us. - Yes I understand that. - So where do we have the coffin? - Over here. Well hey, what are you doing?! - Hello Julia. - Werner? - Werner? Do you know each other? - Werner von Broms, Julia's little brother. Pleasantly. Nice. How do you get up this one? I can't find a lock. - No, we don't really know. - You can't paw on this coffin. Old man, you get it if your name is von Broms and I do. I'll get the coffin because it belongs to me. You?! I'm the oldest, thus it belongs to me. - You shouldn't bring your coffin? - Yes. Alexander von Broms was our ancestor. Therefore, the coffin belongs to us. The exhibition, then? If we don't in money, we can not renovate... And? Since when did this become my problem? Now it must be final talk. Coffin comes with me. - With you? Half is mine! - A third is mine. A third? Where did you get air from? You may well share with your mother. Maybe it should remain until you have decided. No good idea. I know. We let the coffin stay here until we have decided. After the concert I take it with me. No, I mean we take it with us. How crazy it was... - Mom, the coffin is just as much mine? - When did you get the room clean? He has as much right to it as you do! The double chin dresses you. Not that. Browse. I looked forward to von Brom's duo. Now I wish they never came. Now we should not rush. They can change. - But if they don't change? - Roland, have confidence. Werner Julia? Julia, can I exchange a few words? So... Yes... Yes. Like this... We have nothing to talk about, You and I. Goodbye, Werner. I'm not going to leave Valleby until I get what I want. Do you hear that? No. Anyone who still had a ticket. - Check out who's there! - How much do you pay? No no. Are you kidding? I'll have at least the double. Good. Decidedly. We say that. Thanks. Hi. Richard! Come here! What are you doing? Ricki Bee has a concert tonight. And I managed to get a ticket. Will never be questioned. A real hope Brake does not listen to such noise. - No, but I still thought... - You also need to practice. You came twice in Rome. It was extremely embarrassing for me. - Sorry, Mom. I promise to practice. - Silent. - But Mom... - Silent. I don't want to hear from you anymore. Certain lady, that Julia. - Poor Richard. Priest God, first you give us a golden one chance to save the church with this one. Then you send the relatives to take it away from us. Can't you make them change? It is for a good purpose. You could give me a sign if you intend to prevent them. No, sorry. It was presumptuous of me to ask. Weird sound God? Was that you? God? Ho-ho? Yes. It was a sign. God? Hello? Well. God? God? Hello? You can open it? I understand now. Thank you. God, thank you so much! "During the concert, Ricki Bee slips and damages the hand." "Despite the pain, he gives everything on stage." - Strange. The door is locked. - The priest never conducts himself? No. Especially not today when the exhibition is so important. Wait. "The masked singer sang all his famous songs "- - "to the cheers of the audience." Typically we were not there! We have to settle for that von Brom's duo tonight. Check! Mysterious... Hello? - Hello? - Hello? - Hello! - Hello, are you, God? - No, it's Lasse. - And Maja. My little meadows! - Thanks. - What are you doing here? I had unclean thoughts, so God locked me in. - I don't think it was God. - Coffin ...! It's gone! - What was that? - Did you hear? U Roland! - Are you okay? - How is it? You're bleeding! - No problem. I struggled with the ropes all night and scrubbed the skin. - Dear friend! - Coffin! Is the coffin gone? - Yes, it's terrible! - Did you see anyone? No, but I heard something. Suddenly I felt a hard blow - to the head and when I waking up I was bound. - You? Maja? - This is becoming a police case. - The police officer in the middle of the bump. - It's Maja. Are you busy? - Yes. - Come to church now. Okay. I'm coming. The coffin really attracts people. Even the thieves found here. - How is it going? - Not good. The thief wore gloves. Look here. Blood. The thief cuts himself on the glass. Good, Maja. Then we have something to go on. Now we go in. It's over. We can never afford the renovation. Do not give up. God had been a difficult one Fool, but a common thief we shall manage. - Do you think so? - Think? I know. - Do you find anything? - No. With these two, nothing is impossible. Should we talk to the von Broms family? - How is she, Julia von Broms? - How? - A furious handsome woman. - Yes. Furious is the word. What are you saying? What did you say? Is the coffin stolen?! - Stolen?! - Werner, let me take care of this. - How could you let that happen? - So, so. Now we take it easy. I am neither small nor calm! I'm robbed! I'm offended! - And what are you going to do about it? - I'll obviously do everything I can. All you can? Yes, it feels much better... I have been in New York, London, Paris... - Tiruvanantapuram. - Yes. And now says a little, small police uncle in purple, little Valleby- - that I should take the little calm because he will do everything he can! Not good enough! It's not New York, but in Valleby we always catch the thief. Right? - Yes. Of course. - Absolutely. - How do you really work? - They are competent. - Yeah! - Yeah. Yes. What are you waiting for? Out and catch the thief! So. - What ...? - Wait! Wait. I have to ask you to answer a question. I put it to all the suspects. - Huh? Suspects? We? Do you suspect us? Is the constable saying that I am would have stolen my own coffin? - I didn't say that. - Yes. - I did not! - Yes. - No. - He wonders what you did last night. - Right. Just. Thanks. - Julia? Yes? I do not understand what it has to do with the thing- - but I had dinner at the hotel and leave me early. Sleep is A and O. - Yeah. Yes... - You there? - Richard. - Yes. Eh .. eh. I practiced my violin all night until midnight and then I slept. Yes, I can attest to that. I heard him through the wall. - And you... Hello? - Yes... I also slept all night. Sleep, it's A... Yes... - At the hotel, right? - Where else? - Can anyone certify that... - Now insinuations are enough. We don't want to steal anymore of is precious time. You can go now. It went well. But we have to find the chest pretty soon. - What do you think? - Yes. Then you spin on this, then I spin on my way. Alexander von Brom's coffin is stolen. And the day before diving his relatives up. And all three want it. - Julia. - Miss. - Richard. - Miss. - Also Werner von Broms. - Miss. - Our main MIS Sprinkled. - They start to fight. - About how to divide the coffin. - Why not take the whole yourself? - Everyone said they slept in their rooms. - Some of them should be the thief. The question is just who. Richard had bandage on the hand. Could it be anything? Hit! Come now. - Hi, Ronny! - Shit. - Nice music. - Wonderful. Von Brom's duo. - I have all their records. - Is that Richard? Certainly. Young Mr von Brom is practicing. - Did he practice yesterday too? - Yes, indeed. All night. It is good that he practices because he makes mistakes in the same place again and again. - Same bug every time? - Then he learns for the concert. Did Julia or Richard go out last night? - Nops. Not what I saw. - Have you been here all night? - I was just out in the kitchen. - When then? - About half past nine. - But Werner, then? - Which Werner? - Werner von Broms. Julia's little brother. No, I haven't seen him. But I can double check. Werner, Werner, Werner... Nops. There is no one with that name here at the hotel. Okay. Thanks. Look. Look. Maybe you can be tempted with a small disc that... No. Werner said he lives in the hotel. Why is he lying? Where does he live? There is only one hotel throughout Valleby. What do we know about him? Take a look, that's me. "Werner's Ear Mice." You can buy it... "Werner von Broms. 42 years. Butter Singer "- - "with hits like 'Karin, my darling, "Lukas, my dog" and "Alone again"." Check! Werner was once upon a time second part of von Brom's duo! Yeah, I've been thinking... - What happened? - Werner dumped Julia. He invested in solo careers. I get it that Julia doesn't want to talk to him. He's infecting! I haven't heard of anyone Werner von Broms inside. Have you? - No. His career probably never took off. - Up like a sun, down like a pancake. - No career, no money. - Could it be a reason to steal the coffin? - Robbery! Help! - It sounded like Werner. My ring! My ring! After him! Duck! After him! I'm taking a shortcut! - Where do you think you're going? - I'm chasing a... In Norwegian No, you are not chasing anything. You have arrived very late. You should take the "dishes". It would be good if you Swedes strained you a little. "Dish" means the counter. You are welcome! Go for it! - Here. - What? - And this one. - What are you doing? Thanks so much. It has been educational. Come back, you little spin... please! - Where did he go? - No clue. Where! - Yeah? - Sorry. - There! - Stay! The ring! Oh. Gosh... Dino! 0 -Is that true? - Ah, Sara. Cara billion Cara mia! Thanks. Sorry. We dropped it. - Is that it? - Yes it is. Wait! There is something in it. "All or nothing." Let's see. You do not use say "all or nothing"? - Lasse and Maja, look! I got a pacifier. - Ah. We too. Werner's ring disappeared, but we got hold of it. - But the thief got away. - But it's here, so... - Gosh! - No! The ring! After him! - No... Puncture. - Where did he go? It says something. Maja? - "ANS." - Not a chance of cycling. Ans. Dance? Tail? Chance? Chimpanzee? It can stand just about anything. Well, come and see. I think I've found something. - Doesn't it look like an orange? - Is the ring thief working with fruit? - Weird. - Orange dance, orange dance... There is nothing on orange. What is there the more for orange fruits? Check. Orange, lemon, blood orange, kumquat, memory oil -tangerine, pomerans, grapefruit... - What did you say? Saw it again. - Pumpkin mouse. - No, before. - Pomerans. Seville orange? That's right. We need to talk to Werner. He has some to explain. - Yes, I like you so much. - Hello? Hello...? Did you catch the thief? I would have run myself, but me have so much pain in my wisdom... arm, tooth... The knee has ligaments... Oh! So it was not possible. - What do you have behind your back? - Nothing. - There! - I have nothing. - You have something! - I have nothing. Hush! No, it was probably nothing. Well, thanks for today, then. But hey... Nobody home. "There's no one at home," I said! - But... - Do you live in the car? - Obviously I don't live in the car. - Are you sure about that? - I don't live in the car... I live. - But why? - Because I didn't sell so many records. - Thanks. - It costs 50 SEK, flax. - So why did you steal the coffin? - I haven't stolen the coffin. - What are you hiding, then? - I... Yes... My violin. - But what are you looking for? - What am I looking for? - From Brom's duo. - Huh? I'm an idiot who abandoned my sister and took all her money. Did you take all her money? Money... I left her in Prague and let her lift home with a long-distance poster. That's almost how you should ask her for u... ask her for... That was not nice. Of course you were cute! Pour onion on salmon, do it! Sore on the calf and salt in the wound. Don't you see I'm sorry? I do not feel good. I've had a shit job. I feel that maybe I should ride... Take Julia in the ear - and ask her... if... u... If... about... and say f... I feel bit by bit. For now, Julia wants to have everything I own, including the ring. - I believe him. - Why did the thief want your ring? Alexander von Broms, my ancestor, made three rings. One for each of their children. The rings have wandered through history- - until today. Richard and Julia each have their own. The rings must be connected according to the legend. - "All or nothing"... - Yes! As it stood in his ring! Did you get the thief? Do you have my ring? No. The only track we have after the thief, this is it. Do you recognize it? - No. - We think there is something about pomerans. Seville orange? As in Gösta Pomerans! Over there! - Yes! - Thanks! - Excuse me! - Don't play here. - Where is Gösta Pomerans? - He's busy. - We need to talk to him. - We have to. Where is he? Where. After all, he wanted more money. That's why we have to talk to him. Not then, but now. - But it's very high up. - Yes. No. Are you kidding? Never that I go up there! Never, never, never... - Don't look. - Get down right away! What a view! - Whoa... What was that? - Eh... - Well? - Yes. Eh... Let's go last bit. I count to three. Then we take a big step. One two Three! Good, Lasse! Maja? Come on, let's go out and get some. - Oh! No! Maja! - Oops. Come on! Good. Continue. Up. Okay. Don't look. We're just going out and going for a bit. - Are you sure we're going the right way? - Yes absolutely. - What the hell... - Here comes a lamp post. So. - What are you doing here?! - Hello! - Take a big step. - How did you get here?! - Lift. Did the priest send you? Health that we pack up if we don't get paid. "-Pennan. - Is this your pen? Did you come here to ask it? No. This one is mine. - Are there more people like that? - We have distributed 150 pieces. How so? The pen was found at a robbery. It hangs together with von Brom's stolen coffin. - What did you do last night? - I'll tell you. Do you see the boat? There I celebrated my 50th birthday. - Oops. - Lasse? Did you watch? He is not fond of heights. Okay. One lost chest and one lost ring. What is the connection? Von Broms! All three have their own ring. Werner talked about a legend. That the rings must belong together. "All or nothing" it was in Werner's ring. "To open the coffin roof, only this small thing is required." "Call thing"! What if the rings are the keys? Check this out. Three excavations. - And three rings! - Three are needed to open the coffin. Werner said Julia wants her back their money. She might have taken his ring! And the coffin! Half past nine, Ronny went into the kitchen. Julia may have thrown out and taken the coffin. Priest I have no money to pay bills with. It does not add up. We must close or boom again or demolish the church. - Have you seen Julia and Richard? - Yes. They went to the hotel. - Children? Do you carry good news? - We haven't found the coffin. - But we know how to open it. - Oh really? Julia, Richard and Werner's family rings. It had been a sensation, but we don't even have a coffin to open. Ouch ouch ouch. Ouch. - Yes, Roland? - I'm a little hungry. You need help with something or can i go for lunch? - Of course, Roland. Go and eat. - Hello. Oh, Roland. How is he going to do this? He is the fourteenth generation caretaker of the church. There has always been a Svensson here. He loves the church... We will find the coffin and display it. Until we get money so you can renovate the church. Blessed children. - We check if Julia is at the hotel. - Look over there! - Yes... - Please, watch out! Do you have the money? I take a big risk. Nobody gets to notice anything, okay? Yes. Pleasantly. Yes. Very nice. Yes. We say... Yes. Everything good for you and your family. - Well. Lasse. - Hi, Dino. - How are you? - Has something happened? If something happened? The love. Amore, Lasse. Amore. - You mean Sara? - Shit! Do not yell. Look at her. What a princess pastry she is. A perfectly foamed cappuccino. A wonderful almond biscuit. Sara Bernard. My Sara Bernard. When I found the ring on the ground I understood what to do. How nice! It is several hundred years old. And unique. Just like Sara. - What's that strange brand? - The symbol of eternity. I'll get down on my knees. And I'll sing a song. - Sing? - Yes. A separate song. A peculiar song? Good luck, Dino. - Good luck, Dino. - Thanks. Sings Sara, do you want to be my wife? - Is Julia von Broms in? - Yes. She came a while ago. - Which room? - 248. So how? - We need to talk to her. Now. - She doesn't want to be disturbed. - It is V... - She was very determined on that point. - It's very important. - You have to wait. We have to come in a way to take us past Ronny. - Hello! Nice to see you again! - You're good. You should wash. - It was an important meeting... - Oh! I happened to lose them. Sorry. What are you doing? Prao, help me! This is a practical work orientation. Hello? It was the last time. It is completely impossible to get help here. 248, yes. Room service. Room service! Then I come in here! Hello? Hello, it's room service! You never get any tips in this country! No bad lift. Hello? Is anyone here? Hello? Flower bid. - Weird. - Ricki Bee. Maja! There is someone under the bed. Robbery! Assault! The bad lie! He took my ring! - Your ring? When? - Just now! And the huge one the bouquet of flowers attacked me! Bobby? It's best you come to the hotel now. Julia has been assaulted. It is good. What is this gangster hole?! First the coffin, then my ring! - In Valleby you always take the thief! - We do too. Just one ring left. We have to stop the thief before he gets the last one. - What then? - Someone has stolen Werner's ring too. It means... Richard! think if the liar attacks my son too! - We check with him. - Hello, will you just leave me here? Wrapped in a disgusting old ma... The police chief is coming soon. Richard! Open! - He might not hear. He's practicing. Jimmy. - Open. - Richard! This is what Richard does when he "practices". - On repeat. Same bug over and over again. - That's where his alibi disappeared. Richard. I'm on my way. I'll take a taxi Yes, I have everything I need. Just. Cash, please. Good. See you then. Hi. - No, the taxi! - If he goes, we will never find him. Put it in his bag. - You only have one chance. Exhale... - Quiet, so I can concentrate. Yes! - Here he is. - What is he doing here? Selling the coffin, of course. The question is just why. Hello Darling! Yes. He's here in the house now! Incredible. Incredible! Yes. That we could get him here! No, it wasn't cheap. No. - She will be so happy. - Mom, come on! - Yes honey? - Mom! I have to stop. Kiss. I'll call later. - Have you taken out money? - Yes. I give them to him. It is so exciting. It's not wise! What is this? Where is the coffin? And the rings? - This looks like... - Ricki Bee? Is that Ricki Bees bag? A toilet is flushed - What should we do? - Silent. - Richard? - My bag. Have you taken my bag? - Your bag? It's Ricki Bees. - Yes. - Oh? - It means... That I am Ricki Bee. Promise that the three of us will stay. - Why? - What do you think? - Everyone loves Ricki Bee. - Not all. Julia? Mom just likes Richard von Broms. "A real von Broms does not work with pop music. ”She hates Ricki Bee. - Don't be so sure. - I'm hiding my face with this one. Hold. It would crush the mother's heart if I left von Brom's duo. Just like Werner did. - Did you slip on the concert yesterday? - Yes. - But can you play the violin then? - No. I haven't said anything to my mom. von The brake duo never sets a concert. She will find out sooner or later. - Isn't he coming? - We paid. He is coming. I gotta go. The fans are waiting. What are you waiting for? Should you just stand there? Move! It's my party! Sings Together we go everywhere You and I solve everything on our way, we drive hard Trust us when it's chaos Mom, Mom, he's hugging me! - How good you were! - Yes indeed! Fun. Now I have to change to the von Broms duo concert. - Where is my bag? - I do not know. - Sour bacon. My... - I think I know where it is. - There are more than us who have been here. - The thief has all the rings and the coffin! - The GPS. - My ring. It was in the bag! - Mom will be completely crazy. - Now we have you! - We got him. - What about me? Where is he going? - He stops. - He turns. - There! - No. Wrong way! He's coming there. There you are! Hi. I've taken care about Julia. She was quite furious. Still beautiful, in some way. But I calmed her down. She was worried... - What's that? - It's ours. - No... - What happens? Have I missed anything? Yes. Come on. Beautiful violin music Fantastic! Just what I needed hear a day like this. "Absolutely incredible, Richard. Finally you have become one with the music. - Thanks, Julia. - Werner? - Julia. - It was unexpected. Do you still have the old violin? I thought you had sold it. Sell ​​it? Never. How did that sound, then? Still world class? Nah. I've been acting a bit... so there, but may I join in and play again? - Oh really? Why are you in Valleby? - Yes. No no. Yes. No. You abandoned me, Werner! You left me alone with a truck driver! It was dumb. I ask for one second chance. Should we say we're driving? What you did was unforgivable! And you've never apologized! No, but I do now. Now I stand in front of my sister and ask for it. - About what? - About it. I ask for it. - I hear nothing. - What you wanted me to ask for. - Well, ask for it, then! - That I'm really... And say f... - And ask for... - I hear nothing. What are you saying? - What you wanted me to ask for. - What are you saying? I hear nothing. I said I ask for ur... What you did was unforgivable, Werner. It is not a place to pray about a hundred? Short-term loans? Nah. Or 50 bucks? If you have any sandwich... Nah. Forget it. I'm not hungry. Maja Here we go again. What do we have? No coffin. No rings. Just three suspects who are not so suspicious. Yes. Werner didn't take the coffin. He just wants to play with von Brom's duo. Richard wasn't. He had a concert like Ricki Bee. "What? Ricki Bee? Is he Ricki Bee? Julia, then? What did she do last night? I think I know. Ricki Bee concert. Was she at the concert? Then have all three alibi. Back to box one. But... who is the thief? The priest? The priest! - Yeah? - We need to practice. With the organist. - Roland? - Yes. Now. Now? Well. Isn't he here? I don't know where he can be. Be sure to find him, then. We need to practice before the audience arrives. - Sure, I'll find him. - Roland? How hard can it be? Please someone... So, my darling. Now we are here. One more time. What are you doing? Why are you doing things like that? You should sound better when practicing so much. You sound like... Ugh! - I can not. - What can't you do? - Play. - What did you say? I slipped and pricked my thumb. It hurts when I play. But dear children! Why didn't you say something? I have tried! But you never listen! You just get angry so fast you do something that is a little wrong. But is... Am I ...? Am I really that awful? Maybe a bit. Yes. - No... Ugh and fuck what a terrible thing I am. - Terrible, actually. I'm really sorry, but we have to set. Von Brom's duo never sets a show. We'll solve this. No, I'll solve this. - You are welcome. - Yeah... I don't have my wallet... - I offer it. - And this I offer. - For the beautiful music. - You are nice people. - If I could do something for you... - It's not necessary. - Not? How nice... - Yes! - There's a thing you can do for me. - Then I want to have paid. - If you... - Werner. Julia? Hi. What have we missed? - The glass. - Huh? - The glass? - We found glass outside the church window. If someone broke in, the glass should is on the inside. Not on the outside. - The thief was already inside the church? - Exactly. Who were there? The priest cannot be. She was locked in a scrub. - The blood on the glass. The thief cut himself. - Roland was bleeding on his hand. - Roland was bound. - Not quite. He had almost picked up the ropes when we found him. - He pretended to be bound. - So we would suspect someone else. - Did he tie himself? - Yes. Like this: When he locked the priest in, he hid he coffin. Then he tied himself up. What? No, why would Roland... He loves the church. He knows everything about the church and should know the legend of the rings. Now he has all three rings and can open the coffin. Wait there. Roland! Come out! We know you're there! Move! Ah, ah, ah. - Look! Weird. Everyone looks like Roland! - Where did he go? - I do not know. - There he is! - Roland! Stay! - How do we do? - Shall we split up? Take it that way, so I take this. - He's running up there! - Roland, stop! - It's dangerous. - Lasse, hurry! - I dare not look. Well, carefully! No! Maja! Maja! Maja! - Lasse! - Well! Lasse! Help! - I'm coming! - Lasse! Lasse! Lasse, hurry up! - Lasse! Lasse, hurry up. - I'm coming! I'm coming. Here, take my hand! Take it, Maja! Yes. I'll help you. Trust me. I'll help you. You know? You checked! No... Roland - Go, Roland! - Just take me. Everything is still meaningless. The rings did nothing. The coffin is as locked as ever. Why did you do it? You heard them, didn't you? Greedy, selfish people. They would just take the coffin and pull. Let the church decay. So you took the coffin to save the church? It's my home. And has been my family's home for 250 years. I didn't want anything myself. I intended to donate the contents of the coffin anonymously. But now it doesn't matter. Take it. After all, it cannot be opened. It should work in some way. - It seems to be stuck. - I told you! - Yeah. - Whoa ...? Yes. Then we do in the old honest way. No, Maja! - Whoa ...? - Wow! - One more lock. - What's that? - It looks like a lying eight. - "Otherwise the treasure will perish forever." - Or the symbol of eternity. - Dinos ring! - Here. Hold it. We are coming back. - It looks like... What is it, Dino? Tell me now. What happens? Sings Sara, my Sara, from day one have I loved our eyes, every smile you made In an uncertain world I only know this: Of everyone on earth then you are the right one So that's why I wonder on your knees for you now: Sara Bernard, do you want to be my wife? Yes! Dino... Si, si! Thanks, Dino and Sara. And sorry. - Is that it? - Yes. - We have to borrow it. We have the coffin! - Huh? - And the rings! - You must come! My ring! My music! My Sara. I don't need a ring to prove that my heart belongs to you. - Roland, we got it! - Yes. - Check it out. - My ring? Where did you find it? - Your ring? - Yes. That's my old relative. It has been in the Svensson family owned since the church was built. According to rumors, a gift from Alexander von Broms. How did it end up with Muhammad Karat? I sold it too a month ago to him- - and donated the money anonymously for the renovation of the organ. Was it you, Roland? Yes, I'm sorry for everything I set out to do. - But I wanted to save the church. - Dear Roland! We are the ones to thank! We were just thinking about ourselves, but you thought of saving our ancestor's work. Roland Svensson, thank you. - Say thank you. No, now I did it again. - Thanks, Roland. - Yes. Thanks, Roland. - Yes. Thanks, Roland. Thanks, tick, thank you. You hear, shouldn't we open it now? Good day. My name is Alexander von Broms. A tape-recorder? 250 years before the tape recorder was invented. Congratulations to that you find! my coffin. You have holes / it together, as families and friends- - von Broms and the Svensson family. '94 / la or nothing." Now you've got something in front of you. What is it? If you are worthy of my gift, do you know what to do with it. Good luck and goodbye. It's music. - Was it written about 250 years ago? Swinging. - Ear lice. - A new von Broms song? - It must be very worthy. No. I'm sorry. Unfortunately, it is not worth anything. Not enough to save the church. Then it's all over now? - Hello? - The concert. We have to let the audience in. Give us five minutes, just. - Are you sure? Can you really play? - Not me. But Werner. - Wow. - Yeah, it's a little wow on it. We should change our name to von Brom's trio? No, that is not necessary. I think run on this thing instead. Richard, you have no idea how proud I am is over you. I love Ricki Bee. Me too. Drive hard, Ricki Bee. "Are you worthy of my gift, you will knowing what to do with it." I have an idea. Come on. Warm welcome here, this our last evening in Valleby church. Let us with a big applause health von Brom's duo warmly welcomed. Thanks. Thank you. We have a surprise. We will present a new paragraph- - composed by the great Alexander von Broms. Maestro. You are welcome. Finger. Singing I work all night, I work all day to pay the bills I have to pay Ain't it sad? And still it never seems to be a single penny left for me That's too bad In my dreams I have a plan: If I got me a wealthy man I wouldn't have to work at all I'd fool around and have a ball I think I'm taking it! Keep Playing! What is it that I have missed, then?
