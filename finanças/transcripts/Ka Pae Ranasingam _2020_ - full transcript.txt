Granny, how's the water supply? The supply is really scarce. Go and get it sooner. Dear, you were fast asleep. I didn't want to disturb, so I came earlier. Leave the cart behind. I'll get home once they're filled. I'm yet to do Maayi's laundry. She'll be heading to college tomorrow, right. I'll buy detergent on my way home. You fill it up and leave them behind... I'll bring back the cart. Why do you have to take all the responsibility? Moreover, you've been spoiling her too much. She's old enough. Instead of doing her own laundry, she's being playful. Mother-in-law, I asked her not to do the laundry. Get off her back. She can't keep up these antics when she gets married. Or do you have plans of going there with your husband and share her chores? Just wait and watch mother-in-law. Not just in our house... but even at her in-law's she'll be treated like a Queen. -Selvi, sister! -Yeah. Once mother-in-law is done with filling it up, give me a call. I'll pick up the cart. You're very lucky, dear. Your daughter-in-law is an angel. But my daughter-in-law is a witch. There's no water to even wipe our asses. But she doesn't fail to dive into make-up. What's it called, Tak-tak or Tok-Tok? She's hooked on to it, dancing her ass off. Disgusting, she's a curse to the family. Shut up, already! Not enough, there are problems at home, we have to endure it here too. We're not here to listen to your problems. Fill up your pots and leave sooner, instead of yapping about your problems. Ariyanachi! Ariyanachi! Why are you sleeping out here? Please get inside and sleep. It was raining. I lost track of time and dozed off. Damn, I even forgot to do the laundry. In Ramanathapuram... -it never rains though, -Come on, dear. it just drizzles all the time. No one ever out here has got drenched in the rain. But surely they're drenched in the sweat of hard-work and loss. Father-in-law, please have lunch. I'll have lunch later. The electricity company has fired 5 men from our village. They used them to build the company. Now that works is done. They fired them. Really? All the neighboring villages have come together and formed a council. I'll go and attend the meeting and see what comes of it. Thank god, my husband's working abroad. If only he was here... I doubt he would've suffered 'cause of the company, but I'm sure the company would've been doomed 'cause of him. -Father-in-law! -Yeah. In regards to ear-piercing ceremony, ask my father to speak to the seer. Sure, I'll inform him. Your father will be there too. I'll discuss with him. If my son calls... ask him to inform the folks about the maternal uncle's rituals. Sure, I'll make sure to remind him. I've already spoken to them. But it'll be great if he does too. -Okay. -Sure, I'll ask him to speak to them. Okay, dear. Hey, Azhagi. Don't put up your price. At least say bye. Sister-in-law is right outside. -Go! -I don't care. I said leave. Go! She's like a sister to me too. I'll handle her. -Go! -Stop being a drama queen. Fine, I'm leaving now. I'll come again tomorrow. Wow, did brother send goodies? Maayi, dear. All your stuff is in the small bag. Sister-in-law, getting all dolled up... for the video call with my brother is it? Sweetie, shall we see what gifts has dad sent for us? Sister-in-law, I can't find what I had asked for? -What did you ask for? -I had asked for a cellphone. Brother had promised to buy me a cellphone. Maayi, there's no cellphone. Keeping our current situation in mind, cellphone is an unnecessary expense. Isn't this TV an necessary expense? Or this saree was a fruitful purchase? Maayi, elders in this house know what's best for everyone. Your job is to just get good grades. I've always scored well without anyone's help. I'm well aware of my responsibilities. She has no other job, but to lecture me all the time. Mind your words! Don't show your arrogance to her. She's been like a sister to you. But you're being mean to her. I don't want anyone to show empathy. I have the right to ask for gifts from my brother. Who is she to come between us? I'll whack you with the broom. If you don't mind your words... I'll rip your mouth apart. Women in general always influence their husbands... not to be of support to their families. But this angel, is slogging herself for this family. You're demeaning her. Let your brother come down. I'll ask him to straighten you up. Mother-in-law, please stop fighting with her. Does this mean, I don't matter to this family? Does she make the rules in this house? If I don't matter to you people, it's better that you kill me. -Or I'll commit suicide. -Please do! Die, damn it! You're of no use. Mother-in-law, please calm down. She's being silly and you're not helping in making it better. Maayi, come on, let's go shopping for baby's earrings for the ceremony. Let's go, dear. I'm not going anywhere. Anyways, no one likes me though. Don't be silly, dear. You're everyone's favorite in this family. Come on. Dear, Maayi Azhagi is not to be seen anywhere. She must be around. Check again. -Please check. -I've checked everywhere. She's missing. You continue looking for her. I'll join you soon. Where are you heading? Everyone has arrived. Maayi Azhagi, it's getting late for the ceremony. She's turning a deaf ear to me. Hey, where are you headed? I'm going to get my mother. -Bring Maayi along on your way back. -Sure, I will. Look... -I'm going to shove it in -His mouth... Hey, he doesn't have teeth, but he's here to eat meat. The ceremony is about to start... you're the aunt but you don't seem to care. I came here to be alone. Get lost. -As if it makes any difference. -I totally understand. I came to offer my company, 'cause you're alone. I'm not in a mood to entertain your company. Please leave. Fine, I'm leaving. Looks like she only learnt the word "go". The gifts look fancier than you expected. Give it a rest folks! -My dear, Ariyanachi. -Yes, father. Auspicious time is running out. Let's finish the ear-piercing ritual. Are we at the right place? -Look, his name is on the banner. -You're right. Let's ask her. Girl! I'm here to meet Ranasingam's family. I'm his sister. Tell me what's it regarding? That's it, dear. We're almost done piercing. Don't cry my sweetheart, please don't cry. Mother! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! Maayi! -Kasi, what happened to her? -Maayi! Didn't I ask you to bring her with you? -Go and get her. -Maayi! Maayi! Maayi, what happened? -What happened, Maayi? -What happened, dear? What happened? Come on, please tell us. Come on, please tell us what happened? -Maayi, what happened? -What happened, dear? Did someone say anything to you? What happened, Maayi? Ariyanachi, I think she's possessed. Why are you throwing away deity’s offering? Come on, tell me. It's about brother... What about your brother? Come on, speak up, damn it. Brother... Brother is no more, mother. -Are you serious? -What are you saying? Are you serious? Our family's lucky charm is no more. -Oh, no! -What is she even saying? I don't understand what she's saying. Please explain. Sir, please inform them. Folks, please brace yourself. And listen to what I have to say. It's about Ranasingam's job in Dubai... he protested against the Government of Dubai. There was a clash between the Police and the protestors. Including Ranasingam, 14 others were killed in that riot. Oh, my god! My dear, Ranasingam! Their Government will be sending a fax to us. Constable, please give them the letter. Councilor, this is the FIR copy sent by them. The other details of the case will be sent to our Police station shortly. Once we receive it, I'll bring them to you myself. Contact Ranasingam's travel agent and prepare to claim his dead body. Has everything come to an end? I'm not sure about it. Neither the folks around me are aware of it. I wish whatever I heard shouldn't be true. Ranasingam, never takes false pride in things. Neither being less fortunate has stopped him. Only when we sacrifice what we love the most... people tend to like us. But my husband Ranasingam was loved by the people. A Politician always takes the credit after the issue is resolved. My buddy will get it resolved. And I'll take credit. Just shut up! I got here first. Everyone remain calm. -Everyone, please stay calm. -Hold on folks! Please stay calm. I said, stay calm! He's not a leader! But people always pay heed to his word. That's how I met my husband Ranasingam for the first time. There's no water in the entire district of Ramanathapuram. The water pipe laid by the government runs through your village. If you break the pipe midway... how do our people or 8 villages beyond it will get water? If we don't come to terms with sharing the water... then how do we expect the same from other? As you know a lot, why don't you contest in elections and become MLA... then build individual pipelines for each village. -Which grade did you pass out? -I passed out 5th grade. No wonder politics piques your interest. It's not possible for us to reign in power in order to take care of our problems. Instead we'll question the people in power. Your regard sounds good though. There's no one here to stand up against the government. The ones present are indulged in violence and useless activities. The rest of the bunch is glued to cellphone with social media and tik-tok. Folks who couldn't find a job have gone to abroad. Stop finding faults in others. Why don't we get together and question the government? If we hesitate to question our rights... then when the time comes for the real deal, most of us would be dead longing for water supply. If that has to happen, all the villages has to come together. People who don't turn up for the protest shouldn't be given water. -Sounds great. Shall we do it? -We shall! Now let's drop the fight and share the water supply. First let her take her share. She has to go to the school. -Okay, Ranasingam. -Maayi, let's go. My husband, in order to gain people's trust... can talk for hours, also can step down in silence. He was a sweetheart of the people. And similarly, he became my sweetheart too. They're here. Buddy, over there. Dad, are they really accurate about finding these streams? Yes, dear. Back in the day, we didn't have Engineers or machines. Even the scholars were not accurate. But he has always been very accurate about finding the source of water. Oh! Welcome, Mr.Dubai return. -Vanakkam! -For this, he came down from Dubai? No, it's his uncle who's from Dubai. Welcome, son. Oh, so he's a dummy Dubai return. You're right, I'm a dummy Dubai return. But the shades are originally from Dubai. Did you see that? It's to protect us from the dessert heat. Sorry for the delay. I was not able to find the copper wire. Don't worry about it. As there are no rains... folks from the surrounding villages have moved out looking for job. But I've decided to stay right here as far as I am alive. Sir, tears remain the same for everyone. We have to decide, if it's for happiness or sorrow. Just like your generous heart this land will become fertile. Glad to hear that. Dear Lord, hope we find the source sooner. Guide us well. Dear lord! -Shall we begin? -Sure, go ahead. -Let's go. -Sure. Water please coming. Please! Where are you? Buddy is the water coming? -Is it this way? -Yes, go ahead. Let's go. Dear Lord, please bless us with water. That's the wind direction, it's just going to be air. -Phew! -Fine, we'll head this way. Sure, let's go. -Give me the chain. -Sure, hold on. -The one on your neck. -Sorry buddy. -Here you go. -Remove the stupid shades. -I'm used to it. -Since when? Ten minutes, since you gave them to me. Without shades eyes are going to burn out. The heat is unbearable. It doesn't look like a agricultural land. -More of a desert-- -This side is not lucky. Our luck is strong, we're going to find a river. Have faith! We're going to find it. What's it buddy? Let's go. Are you looking for the water source or inching the land? Come on, tell me. Where are you taking me? Why are you moving zig-zag like a snake? Check if that girl is looking over here? You're right she's looking over here. That's why we couldn't find the source. Listen girl, please turn around. What is it? Do we have to stick to this place or we can check elsewhere too? You're only to look at our place. That's why we have hired you people. She's speaking as if she offered us a government job. Tell her we'll find the water. We're going to find the water. Brother, we've been waiting. Buddy, don't get distracted. Buddy! -Buddy. -Why is he dancing? He must've found the water source. -Oh! -This place! Thank goodness, lord has blessed us with water. -Pray to the god. -Thank you lord! Why is he drawing a huge circle? -Sir! -Tell me. If we dig for 150ft. we'll find water. The water bed is good and suitable for farming. I'm very happy and I appreciate the work. If only we don't the water source... then you'll have to deliver water to our farms. Understood? He's an expert in finding the water source in this entire district. If you don't trust us, then let a cow enter the field. It'll graze around and finally land into this circle. It's 'cause the water flow is right beneath it. Oh! So, even the cows are aware of the source? Sarcasm! Then why do we require a Dubai return for this job? -It's nothing but-- -Listen... it's not a hobby to play around. I didn't lie, you'll definitely find the water source. If you find the source, then you'll have to bring water to our house. That's awesome buddy. -If you do it daily-- -What is Ariyanachi saying? Oh, Ariyanachi is it? -It's about the water-- -What? Nothing much dad, I told him this is a very good job... then why is he working abroad in Dubai rather stay back and continue doing this. -This is how you respect a guest? -She didn't mean to disrespect. There's enough opportunity out here. There's no need to move to abroad. She definitely made a point. Am I right, Ariyanachi? You speak wisely, my son. I've seen him speak well at the gatherings. We need people like you. Once I'm done constructing the well, we'll meet in person. Oh, no! Don't take me wrong. Dad made the deal. It's better you pay him. I'll surely meet him person. But you take this money. Dad must've done it as a favor too. It's better you discuss with him and sort it. I'll take a leave. Thank you. -Okay, son. -Ariyanachi, bye. Buddy, at least should've taken 100 bucks. We could've had tea. What if your dad asks for the money? This job is free for Ariyanachi! Let's wait and watch, if we can find the water source. Ranasingam, why don't you explain to us? Greetings to one and all. I just returned after discussing with the folks of Punavaasal. If that's done, there's nothing new to discuss. Just 'cause their village falls first on the pipeline... they're very rude to the other villages. If we stop the transport to their village, they'll be on track. I'm not supporting either of the party. I'm a neutral negotiator. Let me put it in simple terms. Instead of saving scarce rain water... along with the overflowing water from Cauvery, according to the land degradation and river restoration scheme we'll appeal to set scheme in motion. Also, we've protested many times in regard to this. Moreover, our lands are sucked dry and turned into desert... we have to destroy the mesquites plants infecting our lands. As it's a common problem. We'll have to stand united and protest. That's the purpose of this meeting. -Understood? -Are you serious? Our only hope for survival are those mesquites plants. If not for it, we won't be able to afford our daily meals. If we destroy them, then everyone has to beg at the bus stand for food. Fifty years ago there were no mesquites plants. It's an international breed and it's poisonous. It doesn't matter if it's poisonous or not... we care less about it, Ranasingam. That's our staple now. Find a better way to tackle this issue than destroying those plants. You're just concerned about the current survival. But the soil should remain fertile for our future generations too. Even if there's water supply, no one's ready to take up agriculture. Even graduates like me are struggling to find a job. The electricity company is offering us jobs. Why should we protest? There are more than 2.5 lac graduates unemployed in this district. -Do you folks agree? -Agreed! How many jobs do you think the electricity company can offer? May be 3000 or maximum 5000 jobs. Or let's just take it, 10,000 jobs. What next? Later, when our people demand a hike, they'll fire us. They'll employ their own people, leave us in despair. He's absolutely right. It's our people who are suffering for an ounce of water. Do you think my generation hasn't seen fertile lands? We were a little lethargic and let the ground level water run dry. -Ranasingam. -Yes, sir. As you've come in person to invite us... Mezhathoval folks will join you in the protest. -Do you folks agree? -Yes, we'll join the protest. Definitely! Hey-- Hey, dummy Dubai! Hey! Mr.Stream, please stop. I said, stop. Damn it! Hey, you saw a lady standing alone... but you don't have the courtesy to check what's wrong? -Tell me -You were standing alone. I thought you were waiting for someone, so I kept minding my business. How would I know you were dying to meet me? Don't flatter yourself. As if you're an irresistible Casanova. And all the Queens in the world are in line to meet you. Weren't you restless and impatient to meet this Casanova? Who told you that I was restless and impatient? You conned my dad with the water source and took his money. I'm here take back that money. Give me my money back. Did you just say I conned your father? Yes. I'm not a fool like my father to believe in your antics. Look mister, it'll be better if you actually prove your theory. If you fail to do so, then return the money. Fair enough! To check the existence of stream, I'll need some equipments. I'll first get them and then inform your father about it. After which you continue to wait for me standing alone out here. I knew you'll give me lame excuses. Aren't these the pieces of equipment you need to check the stream? Hold them. Here you go. Here is the pot... coconut, and then your main equipment. Finally, water. Now go and find that water stream for me. There's no water in this area. It's possible only if it rains. Fraud-- You're a fraud. Give me back my money. I never took the money. You dad must've taken money from my father. Return that money. What is it? -You want to see the water, right? -Yes! I'll show it to you. Hold this bottle. My lord, please let this fool be my future wife. Hey, hey, hey... hold on. What are you holding? Show me that. Come on, show it to me. Not this, open your fist. I said, open it. Come on, open your fist. Thought as much. Hey, be careful with coconut. Hold your horses. Let me tie my veshti. Hey, how come the coconut didn't stop but you did? What the hell are you doing? Didn't you see coconut going up? That infers that water is up in the sky. Fraudster, you're caught red-handed now. My father was naive to believe a fraud like you... and sold all my jewels saved up for my wedding and now digging a well. I'm going to take care of him later. I'm going to-- Hold on! Give me that. -Fraud! -Listen, girl... if your father finds the water stream inside the well he's digging at the moment. I'll return the jewels and a wedding chain. Will you marry me? Why not? I'll marry you. I'll complaint to the Police and get you handcuffed. He's getting too cheeky. Conman! My dear, Ariyanachi. It's going to rain now. You can file a complaint once the rain stops. Now come and stand beside me. Did you say, rain? Hey, you never change, do you? It's scorching hot and you're expecting it to rain. If I come stand beside, are you going to push the rain with your hands? Get lost! How do you expect me to push the rain, if it won't fall on me? You're kidding me, right? You're saying that on your side it won't rain... but it will rain 10ft. opposite to your side. Hey, if even it drizzles a drop... I'll get married to you. If at all it doesn't rain... then you should stop finding streams for people. Agreed? -I swear I won't find streams if I lose. -Let's see.

I'm looking at your hand. Thought as much. Hey, can you see my face now? Look at my face and talk. How are you able to find the water stream ruining under the earth?

Seer, it was him who found the water stream under our land. His name is, Ranasingam. Vanakkam! I'm well aware of everything. Take good care of our daughter. It's an order from the god. It'll be wrong not to follow the order. If it's god's will we can't say no to it. Make it happen. Sir, why did you summon me? Nothing much, you found us the water stream, right... we found water after digging a well. We wanted to respect your services with the first pot of water from that well. -Congratulations! -Don't mention it. Go ahead. Dear Ariyanachi, please give that water to Ranasingam. Go ahead, dear. -Praise to the Lord! -Be careful, dear. Thanks a ton for making it happen. Listen, pour that water into the temple's well. Dear, you accompany him. Dad, I don't want to go. It's God's will. Please go ahead. You should never disobey god's will. Please let's go. If not, god will punish you. It would've been great if we were wearing garlands as a couple. Why didn't your dad think of it? Stop dreaming. So, when shall we get married? You can get married at your will. Why are you asking for my permission? Obviously, I'm asking my to-be bride. Ariyanachi, please stop. You left me behind. I thought you have beauty queens waiting in line for you. Is no one ready to get married to you? They're just a crush nothing serious. But we need someone to settle down seriously in life. Even the old hags have refused to marry you. But you expect me to keep smiling and get married to you. I'm not the one for you. There'll be a day when you'll come running to me to get married. -Challenge? -Challenge accepted! Listen, instead of day dreaming... pour that water into the well and get home safe. Okay? You're concern for husband before marriage is flattering. Don't worry Ariyanachi. I'll get home safe. I really don't care what happens to you. Ariyanachi Ranasingam! Hey, Ka.Pae. Ranasingam! We'll protest until we get the water supply. Buddy, the Police is here, shall I deal with it or you'll take care of it? Ranasingam, we need to talk. We'll protest until we get the water supply. Everyone calm down and listen to your councilor. -Tell me. -Ranasingam! It's better you end the protest. If not we'll have to step in. Sir, our folks are protesting for the sake of our village's problem. I don't see a problem. It's a law & order problem. Public gathering is not allowed. Law does state for the public to stay united. But you're saying otherwise. I really don't understand. Please understand. Sir, why don't you understand. You're asking to end the protest for water supply. If only the Collector comes down to meet, the entire protest will come to an end. Why don't you explain the same to him? For god sake end the protest. We'll protest until we get the water supply. Ranasingam, we'll have to take action. -We'll protest until we-- -Please end the protest. We'll protest until we get the water supply. What the hell is happening? Your village folks don't seem to listen to us. They're protesting blocking the town road. Aren't you the VO of that village? Why don't you handle it? As if they're not aware of it. If not for just signing their certificates... no one will care to respect me. So, respect is all that matters to you? Obviously, respect plays a vital role. Aren't you the Inspector of that village? What were doing when such a huge crowd was gathering for a protest? Sir, we never knew about the protest. Do you really think it's possible to gather a huge overnight? We'll protest until we get the water supply. We'll protest until we get the water supply. I don't believe that she's here for the protest. Watch, she'll come and sit next to me. We'll protest until we get the water supply. We'll protest until we get the water supply. We'll protest until we get the water supply. We'll protest until we get the water supply. We'll protest! We'll protest until we get the water supply. I'm a little busy with personal protest. Please ignore whatever you see. We'll protest until we get the water supply. Now I get it why you were saving this space. Carry on. We'll protest! We'll protest until we get the water supply. We'll protest until we get the water supply. We'll protest until we get the water supply. We'll protest until we get the water supply. Don't be sarcastic and arrogant to them... then you'll end up in prison. In spite of so many people around you care for me is flattering. Even If I get arrested, won't you bail me out? Vanakkam, Sir. I tried reasoning they don't seem to understand. They're very stubborn! We'll protest until we get the water supply. Vanakkam, sir. Tell me. I was told you wanted to meet me in person. It's 'cause we believe the petitions we file in your office doesn't reach you. That's the reason we staged a protest to lure you out. We apologize for the inconvenience. -What's your name? -Ka. Ranasingam. Ranasingam, I don't mind coming down to meet in person. Of course, it's my duty. To understand your needs and woes and convey it to the government. But instead of considering me as one of your own... you see me as a government official. That's the issue at hand. Of course, problem is everywhere around the world. Let us come to the point. What should I do to end the current protest? We want water supply. Ranasingam, making it rain and agricultural harvesting... is controlled by mother nature. How's it going to help by filing a petition to the government? Pardon me, collector, sir. If you clean the lakes and the rivers... and impose land degradation and water restoration schemes, which will help the plants and trees grow in large numbers. We believe if that happens, we're bound to get rain. What's your qualification? I'm qualified enough to take care of my village and our folks. Good. One last time trust my word and end this protest. In two months, I'll try my best to fulfill your demands. I'll do everything what you would, if you're in my shoes. Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. -Shall we end the protest? -Sure, we'll end it. The Collector has agreed to fulfill or demands in two months. So, temporarily our protest has been victorious. If by chance, the demands are not fulfilled in two months... shall we gather once again to protest? We shall! We shall! -We will gather, sir. -Thank you, you can end it now. -Keep moving. -Don't you fear? Huh? I asked, don't you fear? When we know our rights, fear loses its purpose. When the authorities learn that public is aware, then they'll fear us. Then we can take them by surprise. What? -Hey, Ariyanachi! -My dad's calling... Looks like your dad doesn't have manners. Why don't you ask him yourself? About manners or your hand in marriage? -That's up to you. -Keep moving folks. Dear, please come over here. Was the protest for water or the girl? -I don't hear you? -Both are good. It's a victory. How did you know that my favorite color is red? You're wardrobe is mostly filled with red color. It was obvious. Fair enough! What else do you know about me? -Your bathing soap is, Hamam. -Damn you! How do you know that? I noticed when you went to buy the soap. What else? You like to wear glass bangles. Pond's talcum powder is your favorite. You're very fond of food. You like sweets a lot. What else... You have five baby goats. Then... you love cricket! What else? Obviously you like me! Did I ever tell you? I just assumed as everything happened so fast. Okay, tell me how did you impress my father? It is like... whenever you fall in love with a girl her father never agrees to it. So, I pursued you both at the same time. He was easy to impress. But you were acting pricey. You're truly a magician. I should be careful while raising a family with you. You don't have to be cautious. You can trust me. What will I get in return for trusting you? We can make babies until you're tired of it. Hey, brother... what the hell are you doing? I thought you wanted to just speak to her in private. Yeah, but... I was tell her a secret. Why would you do that in private? Sister-in-law, come on, let's go. You're my sweetheart. Son-in-law hope your conversation went well. If you give me ten more minutes, I'll be done. -Come on, let's go. -Don't you dare! Hope the maternal uncles of both to-be bride and groom agreed to it? -We do. -We do! Sangili what about you? I agree. It's an auspicious Vilambi year... on 5th of January in the district of Ramanathapuram Mudugalathur Taluk residing in the Keezhathoval village Kayamabu Udayammai's son, Ka. Ranasingam is... From the district and taluk of Mearpadi... residing in Mezhathoval village. Thirukannan Selvarani's daughter, Ti. Ariyanachi Between the 9:20-11:00 am is the auspicious time fixed for the wedding as per Kumbha-Lagna. She has become a chatter box. It's a sin if you don't drink on auspicious occasions. That's why I'm buying drinks. -The bride has arrived. -She is here. My daughter-in-law is very beautiful. Son, don't bend down to wear the garland. If you do then you'll be enslaved to your wife. As if it's different if you wear it standing straight. That's awesome, son-in-law. You guys never learn from the experienced. I have no clue about whom to meet or what to do. I've lost my dearest son-in-law who was like a son to me. To bring back Ranasingam's body... we need to get a certificate from VO and Thasildar confirming his residence, also we need to attach ID and address proof along with it, and file a petition with the Collector. After collector verifies the documents... he'll forward it to, Commissionate of Rehabilitation and Welfare of Non-Resident Tamils in Chennai. They will forward it to... Ministry of Indian Overseas affairs in Delhi. They'll examine the documents and forward it to the company in Dubai. After that... if there are no legal complaints lodged on Ranasingam, we can-- we can manage to bring back his body in a month's time. It will take one month? I'm not even blessed to perform the last rites to my son. Please somehow bring back my son. Please bring back my son to me. Bhai, please do the needful. There's nothing which I can do in this matter. You'll have to execute the entire process. If you want to bring back Ranasingam's body... there'll be a sponsor traveling along with the deceased. We'll have to bear the cost of his flight ticket. If we calculate the expenses involved... it will cost you around 3 Lac rupees. Three lacs? That's right. It's not an easy process to bring back a dead body from abroad. This is the regular procedure followed. If you're finding it hard to arrange for money... I have another option. You shouldn't take it in the wrong sense. That'll cost you 50,000 rupees. If we inform our men working out there... they'll collect the body from the government out there. After which there's just one thing left to do. We should hire a lawyer and get an affidavit... you should sign a NOC (No Objection Certificate) on 20 rupees stamp paper. We can send the certificate and the money to them. Our men out there will perform the last rites. They'll either bury the body or cremate it. Who are you? Who the hell are you to decide? I don't care about the money... I want to bring back my husband's body. My guardian angel should return. Do you understand? My guardian angel should return. -Ariyanachi! -Dad... ...dad, please don't give up on my husband. Dad, please don't give up. Dad, please do something. Whatever it takes, I'll bring back my son-in-law. No matter what it takes I want to see him again. Please do something, father-in-law. Dad, please do something. Hey, I heard, Ranasingam's body won't arrive today. They say it'll take a month for it to arrive. It was the same case with Papanoor's Murugesan. Bloody sinners, sent over his body after six month. The living room will be here. They're about to finish it. The kitchen will be over there. Dad is out here, please speak to him. Here you go, speak to him. -Father-in-law. -How are you? Did you eat? My husband has done some good deed or the other for the people... to remain as a memory to them. Only a selfless person can... can make everyone happy. It's the right thing to give back her son. It's impossible! She has no rights over this child. What will you do? Partner, it's better you remain a good relative. Don't indulge in family matters, it's better you leave. Hey, don't you get it? Get lost! -Let's go, son. -Hey, take your hands off him. Deepan, come over here. Hey! Let go of me, mother. Let me go. How dare you beat us up? How dare you beat up our men in our own village? Bloody! Let go! Let go! Stop it. Stop it, damn it. Let go of him. Hey! Hey! Partner, don't humiliate us in front of my people. Hey, it's hurting. Hey, step aside. Hey, how dare you beat up my son and humiliate him? I won't spare you, damn it! Sir, they're lying through their teeth. Not even a year is up since my husband's demise... but they've been torturing me to give up the insurance money. They even claimed that he was not my husband. Also they took away my son from me. I asked Ranasingam to help him in this matter. Sir, she's lying. She's been longing for a male companion. If we question her, she's threatening us with a henchman. -Who are you? -Deceased is my brother. She didn't care for the people in the house. And indulged in the shameless act. Atrocious! Hey, stop it! Stop quarreling! My daughter is telling the truth. She betrayed my deceased son. How can some one betray the dead? Anyways, that's your problem. Only the wife has the right to claim the Insurance money. It's up to her to share the money. How's that fair to us? We took loans on interest to send our brother abroad. She enjoys strangers company. They'll lead a merry life. But we should suffer with loan repayments. Hey, keep you concern limited to money. Don't you dare talk about sister. What the hell will you do? I will hack you down to death! I will hack you down to death. Hey, calm down people. Don't forget that you're fighting in front of a Police officer. Their brother went abroad for his studies and her marriage. He never worried about his wife or son. Do you think he knew about the money before his death? If they'd knew about it. They would've killed him earlier. Listen, at the end of the day, it's their family affair. You're a third person don't interfere. Sir... ask them hand over the money which belongs to my sister and her son, and let them take the rest and do whatever they want. Talking ill about my sister and taking away her son... if they do such things, I will not stay silent. Hey, what the hell will you do? Hey, don't you understand? Go. Everyone get out from here. Everyone get out! -Mom, let's' go. -If you think you can getaway... I won't spare you. I don't mind dragging this matter to the court. I'll make sure to bring you on the streets like a beggar. I'm challenging you. Let's see... She's still screaming, send her outside. I've encountered worse. Hey, sign the papers and return to your village. If you try and indulge in something else... I'll skin you alive. Get lost! Listen, your family won't agree to Police station's oral verdict. They'll definitely create problems to take the money away from you. It's better to take this matter to the court. Understood? Ranasingam, if you start solving all the issues... then what are we here for? Go! If you continue this arrogance... one day I'll find a way to break it. Get lost! Ranasingam, please go. -Constable? -Yes, sir. Has he finished passport verification? He's not interested in going abroad... he's adamant on doing agriculture. He has never applied for a passport. Brother how much is, 33 multiplied 28? How much? It's 924. It's 927. 924 is the correct answer. Buddy, I'm returning from MLA's office. I heard they're going to impose 144 rule in our village. -144? -Yes. Why the hell are they imposing it? Obviously, 'cause they're going to announce there will be no sharing of water. What will people do if they hear about it? They'll be outraged. So, this 144 is a preemptive strike on us. Who are they to decide what's good or bad for our village? The person who passes this bill... should bring his wife and live out here. Then he'll realize the pain of our women who push water-carts for miles. It's unfair to impose curfew for demanding water. Let them impose curfew, we'll show them what we're capable of. She's right about the matter. They can't enter our village asking for votes after doing such a thing. If they do we'll kick the away. You're right. How long do we stay oppressed? We'll challenge the Police's gun. This haste and rage is the reason for the oppression. Government introduces schemes for the bosses... and we'll protest against it. Then we drag the case to the court. We await hoping that the court will serve justice. They keep dragging the case at the court. We'll eventually grow old. The schemes which we rejected... landed on our children without our knowledge. Am I right or not? You think you can even touch them? You'll still end up voting for them, 'cause he's from your caste. Am I right? Then? In the name caste and religion they'll write us off. Like how they're keen on defeating our purpose. We should be well aware of our needs. -Tell me. -I knew this would happen. What happened? You're cheerful all the time. Why are you sulking now? -They've ruined it. Now, what about the wedding? Doesn't matter, you just come home. You're already my wife. We don't need someone to officiate. See, even you don't have any hope. That was not my intention. Give the phone to your father. Don't cry. -Father-in-law. -Tell me, son-in-law. Do exactly as I say. Ladies, stop right there. Why are you out so late in the night? Do you think we're lurking around? We need water. May be you can fetch it for us. We'll return home. Always ready with excuses! -Go! -We know that. Did the collector really asked you to meet him? Yes. I had invited him for my wedding... he felt bad for not have attended the wedding. He wanted to meet us in person. That's why I and my wife are here. Sir has arrived. Honey, is collector really your friend? When the Police can be our friends, why not collector too? Don't you think collector looks like Rajinikanth? Good morning, sir. Ranasingam? Yes, sir. -Got married? -We got married last night. -Why during the night? -'Cause you imposed 144! Curfew was in full swing. So, wedding during the day was impossible. So we had to get married in hiding. It's a different case, if I were a Govt. employee... I can choose to defer my promises. -Hello, mister! -For me, my word is important Hold on! 144 was imposed for a different reason. It was not meant to stall your wedding. According to me, promises should not be broken. Doesn't matter if it was said in private... or it was said during a public meeting. Ranasingam, there's no room for excuses in this matter. And everyone in the country... are not as honest as you when it comes to protest. But the reality is different. By the way, the time given by the people is not over yet. You will have your demands fulfilled. I respect the notion of fighting for your people. -Congratulations on the marriage. -Thank you. All the best for your new beginning. -I'll take care of this problem. -Thank you, sir. What's your name? Ariyanachi! Shake hands. -Ariyanachi Ranasingam. -Delighted! What are you thinking about Ariyanachi? Looking at your concern in regards to people of this village... I thought you took equal care of your own family too, and have been jobless. I don't understand. Hey, before indulging social service... you should make sure your friends, family and relatives are safe and sound. If they're not happy... Look here... then make sure to tend to their needs as priority. You shouldn't let them starve at the cost of people's welfare. Who's been starving at this house? Didn't you eat? Are you hungry? Where's mom, dad and sister? Mom and sister are staying at aunt's place. Dad's sleeping on the porch. You and I are settled here for an important matter... So, we're the reason behind it. Hey, before marriage I used to sleep on the porch. You can afford to sleep wherever you feel like. It doesn't look good, if a young girl has to sleep elsewhere. What is your problem? Build a house which can accommodate our entire family. Okay. We'll start the construction tomorrow. Okay? Hey, stop kidding. I'm very serious about it. I'm serious about it too. Because... I feel really proud of my wife, who cares about the family on the wedding night. Now, what I am about to say... you might think I'm desperate for the wedding night. Okay? No one in my family has ever thought about it... nor have questioned me about responsibilities. This is the first time someone has questioned me. Now sit back and watch things will set in motion. Things which are supposed to happen... should happen right away, if not it'll be considered as a sin. -What do you mean? -Wedding night! Isn't that supposed to happen right now? I think you didn't understand. I understood it well. But you don't seem to get my point. Hold on a minute. There's camera everywhere. So, we gotta be careful. You still haven't understood my point. People will talk. They'll accuse me of chasing away the family. Really? -Who said it? Who dared to speak? -Calm down. Who the hell was it? Come forward. Let me find out who's talking behind my back. When I don't let the problems of the people slide... I won't sit idle, 'cause it's my family matter. That too it's a huge issue. This has never happened in my family during the wedding night. I can't let this slide. Let's find out who's the culprit. Don't worry, sit down. We'll discuss the matter in detail. What happened Ariyanachi? Sit down. Let's discuss. Ariyanachi come on let's discuss. -Hey let it go. -Please, let's talk. I said, let it go. Let it go, damn it. Ariyanachi! Is that all? Why are you standing up? It's 'cause I'm all riled up. Doesn't matter anymore. Listen, if I come to know that you guys were being a nuisance... I'll skin you guys alive. Finish all the rites and disperse. Okay, sir. Let's go. If Ellaisamy was present this wouldn't be the case. He would've never let it happen. [Death Folk song] Doesn't matter if the person is good or bad... their last breath should be at their native. No matter how much we earn, we can't take it to our grave. Doesn't matter if the person is good or bad... their last breath should be at their native. No matter how much we earn, we can't take it to our grave. Dad, open your mouth. -Son, what is this? -You've fed me all these years. I feel like it, 'cause I'll be away. Just this once. Come on, mom. Maayi, open your mouth. You're such a cutie. Open your mouth. I thought as much. Hey, if you wanted to feed your wife, so be it. Don't use us as an excuse. -Dad, look what he's doing. -He's going away, dear. So, he's expressing his love by feeding us. You really believe him? Mother-in-law, open your mouth. -Hey, stop this nonsense. -Why? He's being silly and you're encouraging him. -Give me that. -Hold on, my mom made it. Take it. Here you go, mother-in-law. -Send me a package to Dubai. -Sure, I will send it across. Wipe your hands. Before I head to Dubai... as your elder brother I'm giving you an advice. What is it? If you're bored during your classes... bunk college and watch a movie at the theater. That's a worst advice coming from a brother. Sister-in-law, look what he's saying. -Are you crazy? -She's going to do that anyways. So, there's nothing wrong in it. Dad, he's troubling me again. Please take care of my sister. We took good care of ourselves even before your wife arrived. Don't over do it. He's irritating me, dad. Let it go. After all he's your brother. Look, keep up this annoying face. I don't want you to start crying once I leave. Look, you started already. Why should I cry? -I can see the tears rolling. -I'm not crying. -I won't cry 'cause you're leaving. -Cry baby. Sister-in-law, I'm going to beat him. I swear, I'm going to beat him up. Calm down, dear. -Kinsmen... please come over here. -Dad, he's making me cry. Let's go. Nachi dear, go ahead... go ahead and speak with son-in-law. Go ahead, son-in-law. Honey, why are you crying? It'll take two years for me... to see my child. How can I just leave saying goodbye. So, what else my dear, wife? Listen, don't forget to have your meals on time. Okay. People say it's really hot out there... please regularly take oil bath. You're worried as if I was living in a cold region. Our village has been rated for being the hottest region. That's why electricity companies are here to extract power. Thought as much. If Ranasingam doesn't counters the responses... the entire district of Ramanathapuram will be depraved of him. Didn't you say that you loved the way I speak? I did say. Instead being beside during my pregnancy... you're abandoning a pregnant women. What should I say, when your kid asks "Where's my dad?" Do you not want me to go abroad now? As if, that's going to stop you from going. Sir, where's the 6th booth? Over there. Madam, where should we submit the petition for death certificate? It's over there. -What is it? -We have to file a petition. Please, sit down. Who's Ariyanachi? That's me. I can't find any important documents. Sir, we've attached all the documents. There are no documents which confirms she's deceased's wife. Sir, it has photocopies of Aadhar card and ration card. Ration card won't even hold validity beyond the state. Validity of Aadhar card is unknown to the court... neither we're aware of it. Even on passport it doesn't prove that she's deceased's wife. Her name was not added under the spouse section. If the documents provided by you people leaves the country... all of it will be invalid and discarded. Sir, we didn't even take a photograph on the day of the wedding. As there were protests, a curfew was imposed. Even the wedding took place during the night. People abroad won't agree with your stories. In our country we have something called, marriage certificate. That's the only valid document. If you have that, please get it. If not please leave. Sir, the deceased is my brother. I'm his sister, you can take my word. She's my sister-in-law. Fine, then why don't you claim the body? Bring me the proof which confirms you're deceased's sister. I'll issue the certificate. Sir, we have no clue in how to proceed with this matter. Please help us. Listen, I'm here to do my duty. I'm not person who fancies social work. They get married illegally and then trouble us with problems. Sir... what exactly do you need? Don't get angry. If I agree to your claim and relieve the dead body... what if another lady comes forward? And is she claims to be the deceased's wife... I'll be in trouble. I can't be investigating who's deceased's wife. I'm not an undertaker. It's annoying and has become a routine every month... claiming for dead bodies. Is this collector's office or a mortuary? Okay, sir. I'll return with necessary documents. Come on, let's go. -Vanakkam, sir. -Welcome. Ariyanachi's husband... I've already issued a certificate that he's related to you. What else do you want? Sir, the collector's office demanded for a marriage certificate. I need a certificate to send Dubai confirming I'm Ranasingam's wife. Who advised you to approach VO's office for this matter? Bring me the person who advised you. It's become a habit of them pushing their work on to us. Officials out there has no clue about their jobs. Listen, I have no authority on this matter. Even if I issue a certificate it will be invalid. Marriage has to be registered at the Registrar office. Or at least you should get an affidavit notarized. Only those documents are valid. Please go and check back with Collector office. Tell me, madam. How can I help? I'm here to get the marriage certificate for my sister-in-law. Do you have all the required documents? Sir, four years ago the wedding happened in a hurry. So, we don't have any proof. Oh, love marriage is it? Did you guys elope and get married? Not an issue. Do you have the wedding invitation? No. Do you have a receipt of the wedding hall? No. Is there a photograph from that night? Or you don't have that either? How do you expect me to issue a marriage certificate without any proof? It's better you bring your husband over here tomorrow morning. I'll make it look that you got married over here and will register it online. You'll get your certificate in 15 days. -Get me two fritters. -Okay, sir. Please make sure to bring 3000 rupees, when you're here tomorrow. I'll sort it out. Sir, brother was working abroad... and he died over there. What? In order to bring back my brother's body... we had visited collector's office. But they've asked to submit the marriage certificate. So, your brother is deceased? No proof of marriage neither the person is alive. How can I issue a certificate? As per the law, this is illegal. Sir... the wedding took place and I have a child from that marriage. Sir, for god sake please issue a certificate. Please, sir. I understand. Legally issued marriage certificates for the people who are alive... itself has attracted lot of issues. How can I issue an illegal certificate? It won't work out. Please, leave. Sir, we don't mind spending more money... but we need the marriage certificate. Are you trying to bribe me? -Shall I call the police? -Sir, that was not my intention. I was being courteous because of your situation. But you're bribing me. Get out! Phew! Listen, there are lawyers who are experts in these matters... they can help you with your problem. Go and meet them. Uncle, Ranasingam's body has been dispatched from Dubai. Hello, I'm Vinoth from Ramanathapuram... when was the body dispatched? Do you have any idea when it will arrive? -Vinoth, is this news confirmed? -Yes. I know people out there. Let me check with them. Do you remember, Chandran? Ranasingam's colleague. He gave me the information. Vinoth, who spoke from Dubai? It was Chandran who informed me. But, now he's not picking up the phone. Now, who do we contact? Once they're closer to the village, we'll inform everyone. -No idea, dad. -Last time it was a chaos. This girl's fate is cursed. They've been torturing her soul by delaying the process. I wonder when this torture is going to end. Gopal... call me if you need anything. I'll be at home. Uncle, if I hear from Dubai, will inform you right away. Give me that file. I've already discussed with Sub-Registrar office. If you had paid me a day before, we would've got the marriage certificate. It took sometime to arrange the money. Not an issue. Don't worry about it. I'll sort it out in a week. Let me know if you face any issues in bringing back you husband's body... I'll make the arrangements. We can discuss about the fees later. Collector's office said marriage certificate will speed up the process. Collector's office will always give you a hard time. People who go abroad to work from Ramanathapuram... in the last decade 22,000 workers have died. Sir? How many bodies do you think they've claimed till date? Sir, you're scaring me now. Don't think I'm trying to scare you. I'm telling you the truth. But I don't think there's any issue. As far as there are no issues, I'm okay. If there's anything else, let me know. I'll help you with it. Sir, get this sorted as soon as possible. It'll be done. Don't worry. Sir, this is not Ranasingam. This is not my friend, Ranasingam. That's not him. This is Mani from Dubai. Tell me, Mani. Ariyanachi, they won't dispatch Ranasingam's body. What are you saying? Indian and Dubai officers took us to the hospital. They should someone else's corpse... forced us to identify as Ranasingam's body. -Accident? -That's right. But the company said he died in a riot. Riots! It's a lie. There were no riots. A huge accident occurred at the oil plant. In that accident 15 of Bangladeshis, Pakistanis and Sri Lankans died. Don't believe in lies told to you by the company or the Govt. They won't even look for your husband's body. Don't let them getaway with it. Don't tell anyone that I gave you this information. They'll fire me from the job. Hello! Hello! I've informed her everything. Don't let them getaway with it. Don't believe anything the company tells you. Hello, hello, hello! What happened, dear? What happened? What happened? Brother... He died in a factory accident... but they lied to us saying, he died during riots. Buddy, you protested to bring change... but now it's just reduced to a wall without a voice. Who informed that your brother died in an accident at the Oil company? He's my brother's friend who worked with him at the plant. Did he witness the accident? Yes, sir. That's what he said. Is it possible to talk to him over the phone? If we confirm with him... I'll check with our embassy in Dubai and initiate an investigation. Sir, he did mention one thing when he spoke to us. Not to bring up his name, 'cause he'll lose his job. -For god sake, don't drag him-- -Listen... in order for me to take an action, I need a solid proof. How do I get a proof... Anything could've happened. I'm not here to seek justice. I'm here for my husband. Sir, please for god sake, help us in this matter. We're here to help the public. Please be patient. Sir, we're being pushed around for past 5 months. They say, just like how you ignored the fishermen issue... you'd do the same with my brother's matter too. Who's been spreading this nonsense? I agree, there might've been rare instances of that sort. The hardship of fishermen... or their issues with the boats, people are oblivious in how they overcome these issues. How'd they know about government's involvement in it? Don't confuse yourself. Soon I'll come bearing good news. Hello? -Hello? -Who's at the door? I'm here to meet Agent Ameer bhai. No one lives here by that name. -Hey, woman... -Stop right there. -Who are you? -Why are you here? -I'm looking for Ameer bhai... -Don't make excuses. Were you trying to break in and steal? No, I'm not. My husband recently passed away. So, you're using your husband's death as an excuse... to beg on the streets with our child. If you have to beg, then go to public places. Beg-- I'm not here to beg Shut up. If you don't leave, I'll arrest you. This is a residential area. People like you shouldn't be here. Get lost! Already there are too many complaints registered under your name. Let's go! I'll meet you later tonight. Okay, brother. Why are you sitting over here? Are you waiting for someone? I came looking for you, brother. I called you, but you never returned my calls. When I went to your office, they said you never came to work. That's why I'm here looking for you. Mayapaandi, informed me. I was caught up with work, that's why I couldn't return calls. Brother, my husband's colleague say it was an accident. Whereas, the Govt. offices are stating another reason. What exactly is the truth? It is said, "A giving devil is better than a non-giving God." I have to speak to the officials of that company. That's why I came looking for you. For god sake, please tell me the truth. I just finished my prayers. If I lie, Allah won't spare me. Please come, don't stand with a kid under this scorching sun. Please come. God willing. Your husband didn't die in a protest. He indeed died in an accident. But no one seemed to tell the truth. I entrusted you before sending him abroad. Where else do you expect me to seek the truth? I have to answer to bosses above me. It's easy to crack the way of politicians. But it's hard to crack the businessmen. They'll make sure you don't. They may be in Dubai, but they surely pull my strings over here. That's the power of corporate. I'm just an employee. Don't expect more from me. If I have to continue doing my job... I can't seek truth. I'll advise the same to you. Let's try to bring back Ranasingam's body. The almighty will take care of the rest. But one thing... only you have the strength to bring him back. Honey, don't you have any sense? I've told you a million times, that I can't be without you. You left your family behind... did you ever think or cared about your wife? What do you want? She's been cooped up since morning. She's been starving since morning. I want to serve her food. Let me give it to her. She's fast asleep. You please leave from here. Let me just check on her. I said, please leave. I'll take care of her. You please leave. -Listen, Ariyanachi... -Honey, don't talk to me. So, shall I leave? Come on, tell me. Shall I leave? Honey... don't leave. Please hear me out. Don't leave me. Stay right here. Hurry up, it seems he's heading for a meeting. Okay Brother. Usually you don't turn up, but how come you're here today? Seems like you're aspiring to become MLA. I heard you paid a visit to the minister. Brother, you've misunderstood. You're a political wizard. How can I contest against you. You'll be the permanent MLA of this constituency. People are trying to pit us against each other. Don't try to sass me with your antics. There's nothing permanent. And he's talking about permanent MLA. Get to the point. Brother, I spoke about it last week. She's my sister, Ariyanachi. She's my nephew Ranasingam's wife. -Oh, the Dubai matter. -Yes. Ranasingam is family... he always stands up for the people. If not for Ranasingam, he couldn't have become councilor. He's boasting as if he was rightfully elected by the people. -Don't you agree? -You're absolutely right. You don't worry. I'll be going to Madras in couple of days... I'll speak to the minister. If possible, I'll meet the Chief Minister too. Sounds great. Thanks a lot, brother. Come on, let's leave. -Sure, bye. -Thank you. -Hey, Councilor! -Tell me, brother. -Ariyanachi, please wait outside. -Okay, brother. Go! Tomorrow, we're protesting at Mudilathoor for water... bring her along. Brother, she's still mourning her husband's death. She's been struggling to bring back her husband's dead body from Dubai. Attending a protest will be difficult. I know what I am doing. If people see her with the kid at the protest... the news will go viral on social media. That's how we can solve this matter. Don't you think I care about my people? Just do as I said. Okay, brother. Ariyanachi Ranasingam. Hey, Ka.Pae.Ranasingam. I'm feel lost with you, dear. I'm not strong as before. Agreed that you're alone and scared... courage was your forte. The word fear meant nothing to you. You expect me to believe, that you're scared? I'm well aware of my wife's traits... she's an embodiment of powerful goddesses. Her name is Ariyanachi. My love for Ariyanachi is unconditional. I'm the lucky one who get to spend my life with her. If you don't believe me... then take a look at yourself in the mirror. Today, you shouldn't leave midway during our conversation. Sister-in-law. You must think I've gone crazy, talking to myself. No, I didn't mean to. You don't have to pretend. I knew, you were at my door last night. And you lied about me to mother-in-law. I know everything. People may think I've gone crazy. But, speaking to my dead husband... gives me peace. Mayi, bring me your brother's shirt. That's not happening. Don't underestimate the power of a MLA. I've spent 400 rupees per vote. You guys favor Chief Minister and Central Minister. But you turn a deaf ear to me. I'm the Chief minister of this village. I'll make sure you can't generate electricity from this village. -Sir, hear me out... -Hang up, damn it. My beloved patrons of the village. I welcome you all to this protest. This protest will go down the history. That's awesome! When your came down with the Electricity company proposition... you promised to provide jobs for the village folks. Initially you pretended to employ them... now you've fired them and have employed North Indians. I'm not going to sit idle bear this atrocity. I won't let this matter slide. Hail, Chief! This goes to the Central Government too. Agree that you're incapable of providing water. I'll provide water to my people from Ganga river at my expense. You're incapable of providing water. This woman has been widowed recently... are you capable of resolving her issues? Come on, tell me. It's injustice. Who should I hold responsible for her loss? Central Government has deceived the Tamizh people. The food I've arranged for the women folk is ready. They'll return after their meal. Ariyanachi. Listen, Ariyanachi. Why are you leaving? Brother, he's using me as a prop for his greed. Do you expect me to pose for the pictures? He's capable of convincing the minister-- I've seen Ranasingam protest and I have been a part of it too. Half the crowd followed once you left. Brother, this crowd is not meant for me. They came in to support Ranasingam. I came, just 'cause you asked me to. I never expected him to resolve my issue. Dear. Ariyanachi, what happened? Oh, god! Honey! -Honey... -What's it, dear? My sweetheart. Remember what your brother mentioned earlier? What? First, hear me out. I can't focus, when a pretty woman is beside me. Tell me. It's been two months since we got married. Two months? Isn't three months the right time? Nothing happened between us before the marriage. -How's it possible-- -Ranasingam, shut up. All you do is talk... can't you hear me out? You're totally oblivious to what's happening in the family. Has anyone spoke to you? Thought as much. Your parents are proud, 'cause you stand up for the people. You've impressed your family just as the people of this village. Hey, speak up, damn it. When I speak you shut me off, and when I don't you want me to speak. What do you want from me? Why are you beating around the bush? Get to the point. Look, you hold a diploma in Chemical Engineering. That too you passed out with distinction. You can put that to use... and apply for a job at the Electricity company. If that doesn't work for you... like your brother suggested, try seeking a job abroad. What is it now? I'm thinking hard. -We'll discuss later. -Let go of me. In this scorching heat... ninety eight men are waiting in the line. He's not going to listen to me. Buddy, unlike you I'm not cut out for hard work. It won't suit me. Why? It's 'cause standing in long queues... is the job of common people. Politicians like me should contest in elections and win. Later, people will queue up to meet me. What kind of logic is this? Hardworking class like you won't understand. Shall I take a leave. Folks, vote for me and make me a councilor, soon. Please stand in a straight line. Hey, what is it? What happened? You stay right there. Don't move. Ranasingam, what are you doing? Move aside. Come on, move. Hey, move! Hey, move aside! -What the hell are you doing? -Please move aside. Damn it, can't you hear me? What are you doing? Sir, there's water stream running under. Are you an astrologer? We're a family of stream finders. Then go and mind that business. Sir, this is an exclusion land. How did you get it registered? Hey, mind your business. Where's your superior officer? Hey, can't you hear me? Get lost from here. Sir, sir, sir... -Hey, get lost. -Get lost! -Sir... Sir... -Hey, who are you man? -I'm here for a job. -Do you work here? I'm here to apply for a job. I was standing in the line. I realized that the stream is running strong under this land. -Oh, really? -The force is strong. -There are many villages around. -Hey... stop staring and throw him out. -Sir. -Get lost! -Sir! -Get lost! Sir, please hear me out. It's a matter of many villages... please hear me out. It's not fair, sir. Please hear me out. -Sir! Sir! -Kick him out of here. Hey! It was a huge issue. But no one came forward to inquire what happened to you. It's really hard to make him understand. Please calm down. Do I sound bitter to you? Tell you what, it's sweet, keep talking. -It will help me heal, keep talking. -Ranasingam! Stop arguing with her. First thing in the morning, we'll make sure everyone knows about it. What do you suggest? Our people were vulnerable... that company used it to their advantage and bought the lands. We're not alone to suffer without the water... everyone are sailing in the same boat. Uncle, if we sit ducks, we're the bigger fools. Their kids will face the wrath one day too. No one gives a damn, but you. Why shouldn't I give a damn? Our roots are right over here. Dad, we've been living here for generations, right? This place is our haven. They assumed these lands are parched and sold it for pennies. But now there's water. Not just a midge. That electricity company is using one lac liters/day of water just to wash plates. How do you expect me sit idle? Weren't you worried about our family's future? Do you think your children's future lies in America? They'll shoot you at sight, 'cause of your skin tone. You have no idea. Son, I totally agree with you... it's really scary to venture into agriculture at the moment. I'm getting older by the day. I just have one daughter. If I get her married, I'm done with responsibilities. Beyond this, I have no use for agriculture. Hunger is the deadliest disease in the world. Politics take full advantage of it. No one desires to work abroad. Everyone wishes to stay next to their family and live a peaceful life. It's not wrong to protest or fight for the people. But that'll starve my family. This power plant did bring some peace in our lives. And there's a little hope. Indulging in protests and going against the government... I'll lose the only job I have at the moment. Protest? Who is it against? What is the purpose? It's people's rule. And people are at peace under our governance. -Aren't you aware of it? -I'm well aware. What Ranasingam has to say is... that two acres land was an unauthorized land. It is indeed. Government can't create job opportunities using it. I'm sure you're aware how many are unemployed in our village. This scheme is introduced for them. Think hard. Do you think, either you or me can employ 2000 people? That's highly impossible. Sir, your logic doesn't make any sense. Employing 2000 people... and leaving 50,000 farmers stranded without resources is not viable. Look, I get your point. I'm the MLA of this village. I'm well aware. This is not just my decision. There are many ministers and MP's above me who makes this decision. They're surrounded with well-educated Civil service officers. I believe we're not wiser than them. Sir, doesn't matter who it is, only water can quench the thirst. If not, they'll die of hiccups. Until the hunger exists as a disease in this world... agriculture will be the highest form of business. That's why, sir-- Awesome! It sounds great. -It sounds great. -Yes, he's good with words. I'll discuss about this. Protesting won't fetch us water right away. Nor it will solve our problems. -Stop with your nonsense. -Shut up, sister. -Mind your own business. -Get lost! She's incorrigible. Ranasingam, you've been helping the people to save this land... but that has got you nowhere. But the middle men in the process made tons of money. You were left high and dry, my dear. You're married now. Take good care of her and lead a happy life. He's over there. Ranasingam, we've been looking for you everywhere. -Why are you sitting alone over here? -What happened, honey? Nothing! You beat up ten men of their company. They'll retaliate with hundred men to hurt you. If not, they'll take legal action and the police will arrest you. Listen, earlier, when you used to stage a protest... the FIR used to be filed under huge group of people, including your name. But this time, only your name is filed in FIR. The company you're up against has power and money. Sadly, the people who used to support are not with you anymore. So, tell me, what is the purpose of your protest? Ranasingam, I have more experience. I'm advising you as a brother. No matter what, only our family will be there for us. Look at your poor wife. She was sick worried looking for you. Dear, please make him understand and take him home. -I'll take a leave. -Go safe! -Honey, let's go home. -You carry on. I'll come later. You carry on. I'll come later. What are you going to do, alone out here? Why are you so angry with your family? I'm angry on myself. Whenever I've asked people to join a protest... they always followed me. Not sure what happened this time. May be they didn't understand the purpose. I should've explained it better. Look here, honey. Since morning you met a lot of people. But no one came forward. I'm sure they won't even remember you paid a visit. Even the ocean might recede at times. But the problem with this village will never end. They keep piling up. You slogged, protested and brought canal and ponds to this village. For ages to come, your name will go down in history. I believe that's a pride to preserve. Just like uncle stated... doesn't matter if it's one or two years, go to abroad and make money. Just for a few years. Then you can do things at your will. I always want you beside me. Okay, dear? The coverage accident plan agreed by us... it comes around two hundred crores. You're aware. How can you fix this? Even if you agree on a lesser amount, we're not going to accept it. First thing, we've failed the safety accountability. It's going to cost us ten times the insurance amount. It's not a big deal. If all the agents get abroad... it will totally destroy our reputation. They won't arrange cheap labor anymore. Especially India. Bangaladesh, Srilanka, Africa, Afghanistan It will become more difficult to get cheap labor. Hold on. Hold on. If you people keep discussing about your issues. What do I say to External Affairs and my Government? I've been asked by the Dubai Govt. to discuss with you... and arrive at a decision. You should decide and help us. Otherwise, it will be a big problem. Because it involves two countries international laws... I directly forward it to you. And that's too late. We have to present someone at the court. The case has been filed by the company... and it states that the accident happened outside the company's campus. There are five lakh Indians in the Middle-East. If you force our hand, then we'll have to pressure the Dubai Govt. Then five lakh people will have to return to their countries. If our people leave your country, who will work you, then? You think you'll hire Americans? Do you think, they'll work you. It's not a big deal to make a settlement, reputation or to pay a penalty. -But-- -Wait! If your American company is shut down... Russia, China, and Israel are ready to take over the oil wells. It's enough they know about the accident. They'll take over. Many people from my country have lost their lives here. We're not digging out all the graves. Job opportunities are less in our country. You're providing job opportunity. That's why this adjustment. We can solve all the problems. We need sometime. Time? Time for what? It'll be helpful, if you agree for the final cremation to happen here. Oh! Okay. Is that all? You could've mentioned this earlier. Only one women is creating problem at the moment. It's easy to shut her down. Contact your Indian agent and ask him to speak to her. Make an offer. That won't amount to even 25% of your insurance payout. Listen... why don't you sit down, if you're not able to take it. Your husband... is going abroad for the sake of the family, right? That person is not my husband. For the sake of Insurance money from my husband's demise... my mother-in-law forced and got me married to his brother. Sister-in-law, Bhai wants to speak to you. I've been trying to reach you for two days, but couldn't get hold of you. I heard that you wore down that Dubai company. If not, they would've dragged it long enough with legalities. Thank goodness. Now even the Dubai Govt. is scared of you. Usually insurance coverage happens instantly for employees in Dubai. If an employees dies on duty, insurance money will be paid right away. We never let them getaway with it. Most of the companies tend to cheat. But my company doesn't, 'cause it's an American company. They'll be prompt with payout. Your husband has put your name as the nominee on the insurance. Only your name is mentioned on all the legal documents. From the Ten Million insurance payout... they're ready to issue five million right away. If we complete the paper formalities... we can send the courier today. You'll get your money in next fifteen days. Do you want me to take that money and get re-married? -I didn't mean to-- -Bhai, get that payment sorted for me. Come on, let's go. Come on, get up. -Can't you hear mom calling you? -Don't be stubborn, drag her down. Bloody woman, get up, let's go. -Hey, for the sake of money... -What the hell is she doing? Just for the sake of money. How dare you lay your hands on a pregnant woman? -Get lost! -Don't do it. Let him go. Hey, what do you think of yourself? [Woman] Who the hell is she? Listen, doesn't matter if you're getting re-married... or you plan live your life as a widow. It's your choice. Do it only if it feels right to you. If you face any problem, Ranasingam's house is always open for you. You come over anytime, I'll take care of you for life. Understood? Be brave! Bhai! Inform the company that called you. I don't want their money, I only want my husband Ranasingam. Understood? I did warn you about them. What does the government gain by deceiving the people? I totally believed whatever lies they fed me all this while. You're very naive. If you believe that government always speaks the truth... then why there are thousands of pending cases against them in the court? Look, government doesn't have the time to worry about the common man. Fine, it's not too late. To win, if we have to go supreme court, we'll do it. -Take this. -Sir... the court is my last hope. Don't spare any expenses, even if we had to go to the international court... -we'll win the case. -Okay, sir. Tomorrow, I'll file the case at the court. In another 10-15 days, all these officers-- Sir, why would it take so long? Ten to fifteen days is not that long. There are people who have spent all their lives fighting at the court. Don't worry. We'll wrap up your case, sooner. Not to worry. You can go now. Swaminathan, when were you planning to get me those documents? We have to answer to the court. Sir, I'm working on it. The Embassy is asking for more time. How long do they need? They're dragging this out. At least, if you had made that women understand the problem... we could've prevented the hassle of going to the court. Call the Dubai Embassy, I'll speak to them. Just for the sake of one women? Whether it's an individual or a village... our duty is to resolve their issues. Our salaries come out of their tax money. Get them online. Sir! -Please, come. -What's the issue? A person has captured our land. It's been a year, since I filed a petition. No action has been taken. -What action was taken, Radhakrishnan? -Sir... the VAO is following up on this issue. You guys are great at making excuses. Sir, we'll get this resolved. Check on this matter, right away. -You carry on, I'll handle it. -Thank you, sir. Good evening, sir. Tell me. -This is Ramnad's Collector from Tamilnadu. -Is it about the dead body? -Yes, sir. -Please, go ahead. -Hey, come over here. -It's about Ranasingam's case. It's been eight months. Now a case is filed in the court. We've mailed all the documents to you. -We've sent a fax too. -We received it. Let me know, if the family is asking for more money. I'll discuss with the company and get them a payout. No, no, no. She's not demanding money. Okay. I'll talk to the local authorities and get back to you. Please get this sorted sooner. -I'll try to speed up the process. -Thank you. You're sick. Why are you toiling yourself? My granddaughter, Chenkudi... asked me for a candy, It's embarrassing that I couldn't even afford a candy. The women of the house are working hard day and night. It's not fair that I sit ducks and do nothing about it. Please hold on. Have some patience. Even though they're our relatives... you can't let them starve. That doesn't mean we can feed them all the time. Indirectly, aunt made a point about our family. They kept us fed all this while. Maayi, come on, go and light the stove. -Light the firewood. -Sister-in-law... Whoever invented this ritual... died without realizing the hardship behind it. It's not imperative for us to follow. Sister-in-law, I don't think, it's a good omen... Do you really know, who imposed all these restrictions? I swear on god, I have no clue about it. And I'm damn sure, even the god is not aware of these rituals. Go. Start preparing lunch. Woman... you filed a case and have been lurking around. Do you expect us to seek you out? If you want your husband, go to Dubai. Instead making our lives a living hell. You went to the court right? You'll come there again, right? We'll see. You're wearing a wedding chain. So, I tattooed by hand with your name. When I shake hands with people, they ask me about it. I tell them it's my wife. Give me that. Sir, can you add my granddaughter's name too? -What's here name? -Sengudi. -Age? -She's 2 years old. Get me her birth certificate and Aadhar card. What's your annual income? I asked. What's your annual income? Sir, we're daily wage workers. You can mention what ever you feel is right. Are you kidding me? Does no one go to a job in this house? Your lies are not convincing enough. In fact, my brother... used to work in Dubai. Oh, he used to work abroad. You people are hiding that fact and reaping poor people's benefits. Rightfully, you should hold the white card. But you're holding a green card and exploiting its benefits. What will you do, if I cancel the card? Sir, we didn't mean to-- Shut up. You're aware on how to add the child's name to the card. But you can't mention that your brother works abroad. The next house belongs to you, right? You can afford to build a new house. Aren't you ashamed to cheat the government-- Hey, shut the hell up! You're going overboard. Which awful government are you talking about? You seriously think that my family depends on the free groceries offered by the Govt.? Or do you think we live off your charity? How dare you accuse us of fraud? As if the government cares if the people get their rightful share. You people steal our share and sell them for money. If you think I'm at your mercy... I'd rather die, than living off it. You're going to strike our names off this list? -They're Govt. documents. -I care a damn, take it away. You can write at your will. Mention that we're not Indian Citizens. We're already in a dire state. How dare you threaten a Govt. officer? I'll make sure that you and your family are behind the bars. Another word, I'll kill you and surrender myself. I'll show you the power of government. -You're going to regret. -Get lost! -Morons! -Dear, don't mess with them. -Mother-in-law, you please go inside. -Sister, what's wrong with you? Look at her, she's got too many pots to fill water. How is she going to manage and take them all. She'll turn into Hanuman and fly these pots to her house. -You wouldn't know. -Is that so? Yeah, right! Ariyanachi, is there any update about Ranasingam? Sister, let me go first... I have pending chores at home. We too have a lot of chores to tend to. We all know what you're rushing for. I'm married with two kids, I can feel you, sister. Everyone out here are facing the same issue. I know all about your chores, woman. -She's a new bride. -Is that so? It's not like, she's the only one married here. I don't wanna mess with you guys. I'll wait for my turn. I had asked all the Govt. officers involved to appear today. Yes, your honor! -What about defense? -Yes, your honor. Greetings! What is the reason for this inordinate delay, collector? Even if he's a criminal... it's not right to hold off the final rites. It's not our intention to stop people from exercising their rights. As the investigation is in the initial stage... the Dubai government has asked for more time. That doesn't mean we're sitting ducks. We're putting pressure on them. For how long? It's been ten months. What action has been taken? Your honor, all details pertaining to the case is in this file. I'm not able to agree to what you're saying. Only after a case was filed to recover her husband's body... you have mentioned about six pending cases on Ranasingam. Why there was no action taken? They staged a protest demanding water supply. After the protest ended, neither the VO nor Thasildar registered a complaint. That's why we didn't proceed further, hence the case is pending. Are you responsible for Ranasingam working abroad? Sir, it's usual for people to protest. We can't state someone as a criminal, just 'cause they led the protest. Not every protestor is anti-social. Moreover, as a Collector, I didn't want a citizen to stop from going abroad to work. You were ignorant of the fact and let him go abroad... And he staged a protest out there as well. He got killed in the riots. Now his wife has filed a case to recover his body. If someone of his stature goes abroad... isn't it vital to keep an eye on that person. If he ends up committing a crime, who'll take the responsibility? They'll blame our country. Fine, ignore that. Now what do we tell her? My lord, the body can't be dispatched until the case is closed... Dubai Ministry of External Affairs has mentioned it in their letter. We've already submitted that letter. She claims her husband didn't die in a protest... but he died in an industrial accident. The Oil company is trying to cover up the accident. Did the Indian Embassy investigate on this matter? Has there been any reports filed pertaining to it? Is the spokesperson of that oil company present here? No, your honor. It's an international company. So... International companies are not above the Indian law and order. They're legally bound to appear in the court. The reason why we didn't summon them... is because no accident occurred on the date she claims, Dubai Police, Indian Commissionaire, Labor welfare department, has verified the same. If they've verified. Where's the report? Please produce them in the court. Ma'am, once the case is closed and the body has been dispatched to India -we'll have all the required documents-- -Your Honor! Your Honor! It's hard to believe that he died 'cause of riots during a protest. Do they have evidence to support? Do they have a video proof? Why is it taking ten months to identify the body? Mr.Mayilehri, do you think he wouldn't have protested out there? In any case, for two countries to conspire his death... the accused is not such an important person. My point is not about which country is to benefit. But the Oil company is surely benefiting from this. If we wish to know the truth, you can check the company's website, has full details on their company's insurance policy. Okay, forget about that. There's an FIR filed on Ranasingam interfering into a woman's family matter. What do you call that? Social service? That's a fabricated case, your honor. The people related to that case are here. If you allow me, I'll investigate them-- There's no need to investigate them. They have nothing to do with this case. Do you have evidence apart from this to prove they're a fraud? If you give us a weeks' time, I can provide you the evidence. Mr.Myilehri, don't project an accused criminal as a hero. Sir, I believed in the system. I don't care if the court does right by me. But please don't call my husband a criminal based on their lies. You can live according to the system. Is it possible to die according to the system? Silence! -Police please take you hands off her. -Silence. Please proceed. Sir... It's been ten months since I reported my husband's death. Everyone kept making excuses... and kept stalling without any resolution. I was not looking for any kind of compensation. Please just bring my husband back. I'm not asking for anything else. Judgment reserved! Based on the case filed by Ms.Ariyanachi... the court has reserved judgment based on the investigation. Also keeping in mind the arguments from the Government and the Police. After taking a closer look at everything. Mr.Ranasingam, failed to be a regular Indian citizen... didn't respect the law and order, and indulged in anti-social activities. Now we have a clear picture about it. A person of this stature, after visiting abroad... according to the evidence provided by the government on his behaviour we can concur with them. Moreover, based on the petitioner's claim... about the conspiracy spun by the oil company has not been proved by the defense. The case about bringing Ranasingam's body back to India... taking district collector's evidence into account As two countries are involved in this matter... in order to proceed further the court requests the petitioner to contact the appropriate representatives. Due to unavoidable reasons, the petitioner's claim is rejected... and the court has dismissed the case. Sir, you're not going to resolve my problem. Until you do so, every forest will burn to ashes. No one witnessed Kannagi burning down Madurai. The entire world is going to witness Ariyanachi burning down Ramanathapuram. Your point? The world might be amused by it. But if you encounter even a small problem... either me or the government should come forward. You weren't a help at all. Instead you insulted my dead husband in the court. Don't think the Collector has the power to solve all the problems. My authority is limited to India. If it was within our country, I would've interfered in the matter. But it's pertaining to another country. There are specific structures to handle these matters. We can only go through them. Does it take ten months to achieve that? Yes, I agree. It was delayed. But we progressed. Now that you've explained yourself to me, are you going to inform the press too? Why should I be worried about them? Before I'm done explaining, they'll be handed another breaking news. I'm just worried about your situation. Are you worried or scared? I'm not scared. Call the Police and arrest me. Why should I arrest you? It's enough I rat you out to the villagers. This babul forest is of no use to me neither to the nation. It's the same for the people too. You did this out of spite, but you did a favor to this nation. So, I'm not going to tell anyone about this matter. [News] Babul trees at Thalanoor were burned to ashes. Ariyanachi. Ariyanachi! The Collector helped me get my share of Insurance money from my in-laws. Ranasingam would've done the same, if he was alive. I believe he came in the form of the Collector and helped me out. I didn't want to be around them, so I rented a house in town. I'm working at a petrol bunk near my house. When you're in town, please visit us. Okay, sister. [News] Breaking News! Popular Indian actress Sirdevi passed away in Dubai. She died at the age of fifty four. She made her debut in Tamil cinema as a child artist. Not only in South India, she carved a niche space in Bollywood too. Indian Prime Minister extended his condolences as a loss to Indian Cinema. Mom, why are you sulking now? Dad! I'm going to Chennai. You keep checking on my in-laws. You can't go all by yourself. Please take your father along. I can't always be dependent on others. At one juncture, everyone has to lookout for themselves. I'm going. Mother-in-law, I've reached. Stop crying! I'll handle it. You don't have to worry. -I'll talk to you later. -Okay, dear. Oh, no! Stay right here. Oh, no! How can you leave your kid unattended on the road? I saw that the water was going to waste. That doesn't mean you can leave your child on the road. I know the value of water, 'cause our lands parched. Your social service would've cost the life of your child. For god sake, please forgive me. Damn with your apology. Brother, she's apologizing right? Hello, who the hell are you? Do you even know what happened out here? Damn you, she apologized for her mistake. You don't have to hit me for that. Get lost, damn it. Get lost. Go! Thank you very much. You haven't changed a bit, Nachi. I'm Guna Sekar. Your schoolmate. Sekar. You look totally different now. I'm happy that, this city just changed my appearance. How come you're here? Are you here alone? Where's your husband? Are you here to meet someone? Nachi, I work nearby. My wife runs a flower shop. We'll meet her and then I'll take you to my place. Nachi, how's your dad doing? Nachi, I asked, how's your dad? He's doing well. -Meena! -Yeah. This is Ariyanachi. She's my relative. -She's come from Ramanathapuram. -Oh, is it? This is my wife, Meena. Please buy some flowers. Everything is fresh. How much do you need? I didn't bring her to buy flowers. -Then? -She's my schoolmate. Since she arrived, she looks kind of upset. Not sure what happened. You take her home. We'll discuss later. If I go home, who's going to sell these flowers. You please leave. I'll take care of the business. -Come on, let's leave. -What happened, Nachi? Sekar, I have an important work to tend to. The office will open at 10 am, I'll finish my work and leave. Oh, is it. Then go home and freshen up. I'll take you wherever you have to go. Don't cry, dear. Listen, Nachi... do you have our school group picture? When you're leaving home, I'll give it to you. -What is it? -I'm here to meet External Affairs officer. You'll find a queue on the left. Wait over there. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. That's about it. Look over there. Laughing, is it? -What's your name? -Balaraman. -Where are you from? -Tambram. Head to the last cabin for Immigrant department. Okay. Tell me. What is it? Sir, I'm coming from Ramanathapuram. My husband died in an accident while he was on job abroad. Which country? Dubai. Arab Emirates? Let me check the details. Please wait. The information to your District Collector was sent by our office. Now, why are you here? Why did you go to the court? One of my husband's colleague informed... that he died in an accident on job, abroad. But that company and their Government are denying it. I filed a case hoping they'll agree to the truth. But they lied through their teeth in the court. I have no clue or an idea to whom to ask for help. Sir, if you could call abroad and help me get this sorted. I need a weeks' time to check on the complaint filed. Come back later. Nachi, what exactly happened? I was not lucky enough to spend my life with my husband. Shall I ask the councilor from my area for a favor? Shekar, even the MLA from our district couldn't do anything. Excuse me, madam. Did your husband die while in abroad? At the Marina beach opposite to MGR's tomb... there's a place called Ezhilaga. There you'll find WNRT office. At that office they help people bring their dead relatives from abroad. Sir. Sir. Sir, I came down from Ramanathapuram. -Tell me. -Sir, we'd gone to ME's office. But we were asked to visit this office. -Is it the matter of death in abroad? -Yes, sir. We don't deal with those cases. They're responsible for it. I wonder why they would send you over here. It's better you contact them. Sir, we just came from there. They're known for making excuses. Fine, you guys do one thing. Look for a Punjabi wearing a turban... you go and meet them. Sir, we just met him at the other office. There are more than 10-15 Punjabi's out there. I was talking about Rajendran Singh, IAS. Go and meet him. Let's leave. Are you serious? How did it happen? Did you inquire in which country it happened? She never said anything. I knew, only when she was mentioning this to the officer. I didn't wanna bother her. I was feeling awkward. You were with her, right? What did those crooks say? What else do you think? The usual excuses. They kept pushing us around. They made us hop from desk to desk, only to be given excuses. There was this guy who replied playing games on his phone. Pah! Can't believe that people have forgotten to empathize. There are many departments in the government... they're are not available to help people like us, They're only fit to trouble hapless people like us. Wait. Open your bag Hey, what's that noise? -Hey, what is this? -Sir, it's a Talisman. -Are you sure it's just Talisman? -Yes, I'm sure. Fine, keep it moving. We're here to solve our issues. Not to harm anyone. It's been six months, I haven't got senior citizen pension yet. Please get this sorted sooner. -I'll be grateful. -Okay, ma'am. Please leave. Where's your petition? Sir, I wish to meet the Chief Minister in person and give him my petition. Then why did you hog the queue? Sir, my husband died in an accident in Dubai-- I don't care where your husband died. Please write it down as a petition and submit it. Please stop bothering me in the morning. Get lost. -Ma'am please leave. -Sir, please hear me out. Sir, her husband, died in Dubai while on the job. Hello, didn't you hear what he said? You've submitted the petition, right? Move from here. Sir, I've submitted enough petitions. I've submitted petitions at every possible department. Meeting Chief Minister in person, will resolve my issue. Please leave from here. Sir, sir, sir... please hear me out and help me on this matter. -Please, sir. -I said, leave from here. Sekar, any petition given out here will be thrown in garbage. I won't move until I meet the Chief Minister. I want to bring back my husband's body. Let go. Let go of me. Please, sir. Do something about it. -I'll take her away. -Get out from here. Please, sir, do something about it. Sekar, you saw how they're ill treating us. Sekar, I want to bring my husband back. I don't how to bring him back. Sekar, I have to meet the Chief Minister. Sekar, you can see how unjust these people are. Sekar, do something. They're pushing me away. Sekar, please do something. Sekar, we have to do something and bring my husband back. -Sekar, make the meeting happen. -I'll try. First, let's go from here. Sekar, please do something. Nachi, Nachi, Nachi... My husband-- My husband! -My husband... -Nachi, go from here. Sir, please take her away from here. Please, let her go. I'll take care of her. -Go! -I'll handle her. Somehow, I have to bring back my husband. I have to bring him back. Somehow, I have to bring back my husband. Nachi, something to drink for the child? Hey, get back! -Sorry. -Why is it hard for you to understand? It's not a convoy of a local minister... it's the Central Minister. If I screw up, I'll be presented with memos all my life. I'm really sorry. Please understand and step back. [Praised Sloganeering] Hey, woman... where are you going? Stop right there. You shouldn't be here. Please listen, don't go out there. Stop right there. Hey! I won't leave without meeting the minister. Let go of me. Let her go. Don't rough her up. Come on, step back. Leave her. I said, let go of her. What happened? What seems to be the problem? What is so trivial that you had to jump in front of my car? Where are you from? And which group you belong to? Does this have something to do with any protest? Please write down your woes and file a petition. I'll do what ever I could to sort the issue. What is your demand? I want my husband back. I didn't get you. I don't understand. Since four years her husband has been working in Dubai. Unfortunately ten months ago, he died in an accident on the job. We tried everything to bring his body back. Ariyanachi has filed petitions in every possible office. When we tried meeting the Chief Minister in person... we tried our best. But we couldn't... that's why she had to take this step. I'm so sorry. One second. Officers, send everybody back. Everyone fall back. Send everybody back. Ask everyone to fall back. Go back. I want to speak to them in private. -Go back! -Everyone move. -Come on, leave. -Don't crowd over here. Ask them to move to the other side. I respect your emotions. But, I'm a Defense Minister. Deputy Defense Minister. Your grievance falls under different ministry. So, you want me to find who's that and jump in front of their car instead of yours? Nachi, don't be so rude. Sir, it's fine. Poor thing, she has gone through a lot. Even if I come forward to help, the concerned department... will obey only if the minister of their department approves it. Anyways I'll try to solve your problem. In whichever way I could. Okay? -Officer! -Madam. No action should be taken against her. No inquires. No follow ups. -Did you understand? -Madam, but she... Please! She's gone through hell and has come down to bring back her husband. I don't have the right solution to her problem. But I believe in conscience. Don't enforce your power on the common people. Go! Okay, madam. -Joseph! -Yes, madam. Phone! -Give her your number and note down hers. -Okay, ma'am. Come closer. What is your husband's name? Ma'am, it's Ranasingam. Okay. Ranasingam. I'm going to address this issue by tagging the concern minister in the tweet. Definitely, it's going to be viral. Swami, switch on the projector. [News] A woman from Ramanathapuram district... Sir, these people never change. When she created a ruckus, we should've got her arrested. Or at least we should've got her convicted in the court. Nowadays, us collectors and ministers have become a joke to them. Swami, I never asked for your opinion. The Collectors, Officers and Ministers are humans too. They're not gods. In your purview... you expect us to go personally and bring back her husband's body. Swami, can you stop with ridiculous comments. Sorry, sir. Unofficially we could've pointed her in the right direction. That's not our duty. Defense Minister's tweet on the girl... it's not her duty as well. Sir, what shall we do now? [News] A woman from Ramanathapuram... tried committing suicide by jumping in front of Central Minister's car Here's the conversation that happened between them. Today, when the Central Defense Minster came to Chennai... a woman jumped in front of the security vehicle that created a chaos. We learn that, she was looking to bring back her dead husband from Dubai. The Central Minister took a picture with her shared it on twitter. That picture has gone viral on the social media. [NEWS] Recently deceased Sridevi's body... arrived at Mumbai after 72 hours from Dubai. We'll check more details pertaining to it from our reporter, Padmapriya. Tell us, Padmapriya. Any idea where have they planned to keep the body for tonight? VIP's, Politicians of major parties and film celebrities, who all are going to attend the funeral? What arrangements are made for safety? Can you please enlighten us with more information on this matter? Nachi, why are you getting drenched in the rain? Did you watch the news? What do we do now? I'm going to meet that Minister in person. Are you talking about the Foreign Minister? Are you going to Delhi? What makes you think he'll be in Delhi? They keep traveling the world. It's not advisable to go there alone with a child. Please listen to what I have to say. We'll ask your father to come down. We'll take a decision after discussing it with him. Please be patient. It's been ten months, since I saw my husband Ranasingam's face. I understand your concern. But decisions taken in haste will have consequences. Please understand. Moreover, you traveling alone to Delhi... The consequences will remain the same regardless of the company. People who are at the pinnacle of authority... should realize our undiluted pain and hardship, Sekar. Sir, I'm here to file a petition. Sir, I'm here just to meet the Prime Minister and hand over my petition. Just one minute. Ariyanachi? What are you doing over here? I'm here to meet the Foreign Minister. He's not available at the moment. He's visiting his home-state at the moment. Did Defense Minister's tweet helped you in anyway? Do you know anyone from the Parliament? What about Delhi? Actually, International Tourist Day is being held at Qutub Minar, tomorrow. Central Minister is definitely attending that event. I'll try my best and make sure that you meet the Central Minister. It's fine, please don't bother yourself with it. I'll handle it myself. Ariyanachi, I have no qualms in helping you. Do you see this Ministry building? The huge gates erected in front of it... are only to intimidate the people. Honesty can't get through these gates. Trust me, you can't meet any member of the Parliament. If you want to meet the minister and get your work done... there's another option to it. Come on, let's go. Sorry, Ariyanachi. Due to Delhi Pollution issue... Minister’s plan to visit International Tourist day has been canceled. Despite voicing out the truth, it gets lost in the crowd. If you think truth was lost, I wouldn't have noticed you. Just like you mentioned... someone will have the tendency to notice the truth. And they'll come forward and support us. Your voice will be heard.
