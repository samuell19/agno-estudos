Found the tunnel. -[DRUMS PLAYING] -[MAN SHOUTING ORDERS] MAN: Forward march! Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Left flank march. One, two, three, four. One, two... Detail halt! Right face! Forward march! Forward march! One, two, three, four! Detail halt! [MAN CONTINUES SHOUTING ORDERS] Company halt! [DRUMS CONTINUE] [DRUMS CONTINUE] [DRUMS STOP] Corporal Timothy Dwight Lovingwood, 3rd Corps, 23rd Battalion, Virginia Cavalry. Major. The prisoner will rise to hear the charge. Is there some reason why the prisoner refuses to stand? Yes, colonel, there is. You might be commander of this here fort. You was down south, you wouldn't be fit to tote guts to a coon dog. [WHOOPING] Now you know, bluebelly. -Get up, son. -It's Army regulations. Lieutenant Shaffer, replace the detail with orderlies. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Do as I say, lieutenant. Those orderlies, major... most of 'em haven't even held a rifle until now. They're as like to hit each other as they are Lovingwood. Like as not. Detail, surrender arms. I said surrender arms! Now! Major, what do you think you are doing? -Get that man back in detail. -No, sir. -What? -Please, sir. They feeds these men. They don't wanna shoot 'em. They'll shoot, or by God, I'll shoot them. -Colonel. -I know. It's gonna play hell with the rebs. Gonna play hell with everybody. Major Wolcott, I've lost two sons and three grandsons in this war. Now, I don't need ridicule from that rednecked rebel. No, not as much as you need to change those orders. Lieutenant Shaffer has my orders. [SIGHS] Corporal Timothy Dwight Lovingwood, 3rd Corps, 23rd Battalion, Virginia Cavalry. Under the command of Captain Dorrit Bentley. For attempting to escape and killing a guard, you are sentenced to death by firing squad. Sentence to be carried out immediately. COLONEL: Major Wolcott, you will give the order to fire. Fire! Fire! Damn it, fire! WALCOTT: I'll take it, lieutenant. Ten-hut! -Steady. Aim. -Fire! [CHUCKLES] I'm still alive! I'm still alive! Colonel, the regulars. Let them do it. Let them do their job. Let's go. Ready. Aim! Fire! I'm still alive. I'm still alive! [ALL SCREAMING] [HOLLERING] [GUNSHOT] [SILENCE] I was watching. Orderly! -Orderly! -Yes, sir! You see that Miss Emily gets on that wagon. And send that reb mail along too. Yes, sir. You're not sending me away? You have missionary friends at Fort Marcy, you'll be better off with them. Why? I've come most the way across this country to see you. You couldn't have picked a worse time or place. I didn't pick it. The war did. Is it too much to want to share a few days with you? There are a lot of things I wanted to share with you, Emily. But this was not one of them. Couldn't you have done something to stop it? He was a child. Child or man, he was a soldier. And this is war. I don't like you seeing it. We missionaries have not avoided the battlefields between here and Boston. I've seen the war, Tom. I hate what I've seen. I know. I like to see things grow. I don't like to see things die. All those things we promised each other, four years ago, before the war... have you forgotten them? Mm... I remember a very... a very beautiful girl. We were gonna get married. I was gonna be a... ...a farm... We should have gotten married then. Taken our chances on the war. This fighting isn't gonna go on much longer. You go on to Fort Marcy. -I'll join you there. -I'll wait. I came here to tell you that I love you. You picked one hell of a time to come courtin'. We're gonna break out tonight. Those of us that can. Timothy told us what we needed to know. The tunnel does come up in the cookhouse. Yeah, but how do we know where it comes out? They killed him before he could tell us that part of it. The river. In case of Apache attack, these bluebellies can't afford to be cut off from their water supply. [CLATTERING] Aren't you feeling well? Well, answer the lady. -No, ma'am. -No, ma'am. Well, why didn't you come on down to the hospital? Hospital? You see, ma'am, a boy goes to hospital, that's just like saying goodbye. Our regimental doctor isn't the very best. I see. Perhaps I could help. I've done some nursing. Well? Well, I got a touch of the Colorado quickstep, ma'am. -That's, uh... -She knows what it is, soldier. -You got quickstep too, ma'am? -Well... [CHUCKLES] All right, suppose you boys get that box in there so the lady can get on, huh? Yes, sir. [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [SHOUTS TO HORSES] Captain, I want you boys to give me your word you won't try sawing out of here again. I'll give you my word what happened this morning won't happen again. -MAN: You go to hell, bluebelly. -[ALL LAUGH] I've been there, sergeant. Well, how'd you like to go back, major? [LAUGHTER] MAN 2: Were you in Atlanta, major? You finished? All right, there's something you might like to hear. Here's a message just brought in by courier. "Lee retreated from Richmond. Pickett's line has been broken. Grant's closing along the Appomattox River." And you thought we'd be happy to hear that? No, it's just that you'll all be going home soon. None of you are gonna get there any quicker by trying to escape. Especially since you have to go by way of Mexico. Well, now who says we want to get home? Your men. And how'd you know that? Their letters. Oh, that's right. You do read their letters, major. I can see you're fretting over their feelings, all... leaky-eyed, loving 'em like a brother. Major, they don't have one damn bit of love for you. Whether you own up or not... you hate them. I hate no man. Well, there's a little time yet. Captain, what do you want? Why, for you to feel the way I do, that's all. The war's nearly over. Major, this war will never be over. It sure seems like that sometimes, don't it, hm? Sure does. Seems to me, that man's got a heart in him, captain. Well, he can afford one. He's winning. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Now. [GRUNTS] Now, you're gonna be our guard. You'll have to call out. [MOANING] Sir, I do not think I'm gonna live till morning. You'll have to, son. You'll have to tell those Yankees that all's well. Captain? Captain. He might've been small, but he sure could kick. Captain, the cookhouse is clear. Good. First you'll silence tower number two. Yes, sir. Sound off for the guard. Then take care of tower number one. Yes, sir, captain. Tower one, all's well. Quiet. Tower two, all's well. Prison yard, all's well! Why don't you just sing Dixie, you damn fool. You're supposed to sound like a Yankee. I can't sound like a Yankee! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANS] [EXHALES] The cookhouse! Look at this... They should be at the river by now. We'll keep these bluebellies plenty busy up here, then we'll meet 'em. Hey, bugler! We'll sound reveille for ya. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSES WHINNY] [YELLING] [SHOUTS] -What's going on out there? -I don't know. -You wanna go find out? -No. -Do you? -No! [BLAST IN DISTANCE] Only the big ones. Dorrit, aren't you forgetting something? -Hmm? What? The other six men. Yes. [BLASTING CONTINUES] Run for your lives! They just hit the ammunition shed! [HORSES WHINNY] No, major, I can't spare the cavalry. Already, we spotted Apache scouts out there trying to find out how badly we're hurt. WALCOTT: May I remind you, sir, that Captain Bentley's men are the Virginia 23rd. -Yes, you may. -They're no buttermilk cavalry. -Colonel? -Yes? -It's the pig's feet. -What about the pig's feet? I'd say smoked a little more than you like them, sir. WALCOTT: How important is it to catch them? -We're at war, major. -Not much longer. You read the dispatch. Chances are we'd turn them loose by the time we caught them. Wouldn't leave this place any weaker than it is. Major, do you realize how it would look in the official report? If I couldn't show that I had at least... Major, don't you care about what the rebs did to us? Don't your men care? Right now, my men don't care if the Union goes to hell. You see, they feel they've won the war. And they're right, they have. Now, they wanna take their lives home with them. There's no military reason why they can't. Well, then I'll give them a military reason. -Court martial. -Colonel. Colonel. -What? -It's the pigeons, sir. -What about the pigeons? -They're mighty crisp, sir. What in hell isn't burnt around here? You have your orders, major. You don't like them, do you? But you will carry them out, won't you? WALCOTT: Yes, sir. If you were a rebel, you probably wouldn't. And that's one of the reasons why we're winning the war. Yes, sir. [SHOUTING] [LAUGHING] We'd better... we'd better count heads, captain. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... ...nine. Biltner had a wife he only spent one week with. One week? I make the river five, maybe six miles an hour. Well, them Yankees gonna catch us for sure now, captain. We ain't never gonna get to Mexico on them logs. Well, my word. Sure is hot! Yeah, it is at that. I see you worried all to hell, Lonnie. I never worry, Daniel. Not unless it's over his stinkin' looks. Worrying's worse in the sun. -Lonnie, let me tell ya... -All right. All right. When that Yank detail left the fort yesterday afternoon with Miss Emily, they had to swing 20 miles around the Big Hatchett before they could pick up the river trail. No matter what, we're ahead of them. Yeah, but how are we gonna stop them, captain? They're on horseback and they're armed. We're not gonna stop them. Biltner is. You boys know what happens to stragglers? Indians get 'em. When they do, they pull their innards out and make 'em walk around a tree. Now, if that doesn't scare you, maybe this will. Man's intestines ais 30 feet long and that's more walking than you two have ever done put together. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] I'm worried about that detail to Fort Marcy. You think the rebs might come across it? There's a chance. Been trying to put her outta my mind since the rebs lit out, but I can't anymore. All right, step up the pace, sergeant. [ADVENTUROUS MUSIC PLAYING] [GUNSHOT] -[HORSE WHINNIES] -Back! Back across the river! [HOOFBEATS] -That's enough, Luther. -[LAUGHING] Yeah, short and sweet. Yeah, you done real good, Luther. Yeah. [LAUGHS] Strip the wagon. Kettlinger, help Dan with the supplies. Only what we need, Luther. It's war, ma'am. Pru, come over here. Look after the lady. We may just need her. Captain. Thank you, Lonnie. Don't worry, miss. We're southerners. We treat our women with respect. Our women and our horses. So they say. Pru, I thought I asked you to look after the lady. She's not going far, Dorrit. Sergeant Elmore still has a pulse. Will you carry him? Then kill him! [HORSE WHINNIES] Put her on behind me. Sergeant, take care of that horse. All eight of them dead, sir. Well, that accounts for the escort. Yeah. Major! Major Wolcott! Sergeant, start digging. Hey! The rebels get the girl too, sergeant? Who asked you to speak? Somebody asked you to speak? You're lower than mud on a swayback sow's belly. Don't you forget it. Excuse me, sir. It's one of theirs. The grave held one of the rebs. It's not the girl. They took her along with them. They won't hurt her, sir. Now, what makes you so sure of that? There's no point to it. She can't hurt them. Boy, didn't anybody tell you a man can get ornery just for the hell of it? Now, go help with the burial detail. Yes, sir. Lookit there, this boy was just losing his breakfast. I'm about to lose mine too. What for? If he don't make you sick, nothing will. Where you think you're going, corporal? To hell, sergeant. Here. Get back here. Blue Lake, if I happen to get killed, bring me back here and bury me, will you? All right, now that is Diablo Run. Looks a lot different when you get in it. I don't fancy getting lost. Up there with our boys, sir? I'll bet Bentley's couldn't do it. No, I bet they can and I bet they will. It's quicker. That's where we're headed from here. Without checking tracks downstream, sir? -That's right. -Major, what if you're wrong? I hope I am. Then we'll get there ahead of Bentley, cut him off from Mexico. They haven't got much sand left in their craw. They're tired... four years tired. Damn. Damn! Kettlinger. -Yes, sir? -Sergeant, go see what's ahead. Mo. Bagnef. Set a line. Well, only dust is what we raised. I think you'd better ride up and give those glasses to Kett. Yes, sir. All right. Who's the lady gonna double up with now? You're too slippery, Lonnie. She couldn't hang on. [LAUGHS] Yeah, that's right, Lonnie. Well, others have managed, right, Luther? Yeah, that's right. Except all of them was big and fat sows! Lonnie, you gonna let Luther sass you that way? What would you suggest, Luther? She'd ride with you? You'd make a buzzard sick. [ALL LAUGH] Besides, you don't care about women. All you care about is killing. Well, then, maybe, maybe, Lonnie. Damn it all, it is fun, ain't it? [CACKLES] Sure is fun. [BOTH LAUGHING] Oh, Lonnie! I believe we'll just let them work it off this way. [LONNIE AND LUTHER CONTINUE TO LAUGH] [LAUGHING] [PANTING] Kill me or let me go. If you don't, I'm gonna kill you the next time we're alone. [MAN SHOUTING] It's the Feds, captain. The bluebellies, they're coming. They're on the mountain? They're coming, yes, sir. Mounted infantry. Wolcott didn't even bother to send cavalry. That's an insult to us? As much an insult as a glove in the face. This is a war, Dorrit. Not a duel. But how could they be as near as they are? Less they cut across directly. He cut across directly. You mean he knew what we done before we done it? Before you even thought it. [SCREAMS] Captain, there's a little village down forest side the mountain, kind of a slab town, like the town of Memphis. Meaning ladies? Well, they're wearing dresses, don't know I'd call them ladies. Boys, we're about to give Major Wolcott a time. Mo, you're the sharpshooter. Take the Whitworth and stay behind with Kettlinger. What for, captain? You're gonna lay for those bluebellies. Captain, I thought the whole plan of getting away was to get home. It is, but we're at war, sergeant. All I want Mo to do is snipe a few of them and hold them up. Let's just say a little reception for the major. Rest of ya, mount up. Mo? Whatever you do, don't aim for that Yankee major, understand? Uh, no. Just don't shoot him, you understand that, don't you? She's coming with me. Leave it be, Dorrit. Dorrit, it's not worth it. I know it. But somehow, someplace, we got to win before we lose. Don't be afraid. You bring her along. Don't you say one more word to him. Not one. [GUITAR PLAYING] -[MUSIC STOPS] -Hello! [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] Hey, the war's over. Hey, captain! Hey, captain? Appomattox. -Dan! Lonnie! -Don't say anything! -But, captain... -I said don't say anything! Bluebelly. Lonnie check for horses in back. Dan, forage around. Horses can wait, Dorrit. I don't know as I can. You can wait! Why don't we keep this between us for now, huh? Play! Go on, play! Well, go on! Well? -I don't know, captain. What good would it do? -Keep the war going. Lee may have surrendered, that doesn't mean we have to. Wait, are you telling me, captain, or are you asking me? If the war's over, you just shot your last bluebelly. Well, then... what are we gonna do, captain? Win our war. That major and those Yanks are still after us. It's out last chance, Luther, our last chance to win anything for a long, long time. Yeah. If them Yanks found out, they wouldn't fight us, would they? They'd just gonna leave us be, huh? Maybe... and maybe not. -But who's gonna tell them? -Not me, captain. Not me. LUTHER: [CHUCKLING] Not me. -What was he doing here? -Oh, I didn't ask, Pru. -Deserter, maybe. -He was no deserter. Looks more like a dispatch rider to me, Dorrit. [Pru] Did he have any dispatch on him? Oh, no. Whatever he was, get him outta here. I don't want the lady to have to look at that mess. [LAUGHING] Yes, sir, captain. BENTLEY: Pru, lock her up in one of the back rooms. -Back rooms? -Yes, Pru. In one of the ladies' rooms. They do have rooms. Take her back there and watch her. Take her! Lessen you rather me have Luther do it. [WOMAN SPEAKS SPANISH] -How does he plan to do it? -Ma'am? Use me to kill Major Wolcott? At Fort Hawkes, it was Major Wolcott who offered Bentley every kindness he could. Yes, ma'am. He was killing Captain Bentley with kindness. If it had been up to me, I'd have just killed him. Your captain seems to prefer that to defeat. Captain Bentley's not the way you see him, ma'am. Dorrit's use to offering kindness, not accepting it. But he's a gentle, generous person. Gentle? Gentle? -How long have you known him? -Since long before the war. He's not the way you see him, lieutenant. How long we got to hold 'em? Till sunset. Not long. It do seem foolish. I mean, we... We could just skedaddle and not pay them no mind. Captain says we're better off to hold 'em off here. Stand a better chance to get away. All I can see is we're settin' when we could be going. Bagnef! Bagnef! You're supposed to be watching these horses, boy. You're supposed to be watching these mounts, boy. How do you think we're gonna get out of here, walk? Bagnef? What are you looking at? Nothing you can see from here. If I rode straight across them mountains, instead of south... I'd see my home before I see the sun tomorrow. I wanna get home, sergeant. Oh, Bagnef, we all wanna get home, boy. But we just keep fighting. Till there's nobody left to fight. [DISTANT GUNSHOTS] Go home, son. Go home. It matters more to you than it does to the rest of us, anyways. I'll take care of it with the captain. Thank you. Now, git! Git! Ha! [WHISTLES SHARPLY] [MUSIC AND CHATTER] [WOMAN SPEAKING SPANISH] [SCREAMS] [SHOUTING] Which one's it gonna be, Lonnie? What? I said, which one's it gonna be? Ophelia. I'm afraid all Cora Linn's liable to have left is burnt cotton and Confederate money. Well, I hope y'all are poorer than a skinned rat. You and your Yankee wives. Wife, Luther. I have only one Yankee wife. Lonnie, you ain't nothing but a pig. And a traitor. That's right, Lonnie, a traitor. You know what you're saying, Luther? I'm asking, because I wonder if it's right to call out a man who's got nothing but pork fat between his ears. [CHUCKLING] You calling me out, Lonnie? That's right, Luther. Well, then, come on, pretty boy! Captain! -Pretty boy! -What are you two doing? We's fighting out there! Didn't you hear that shooting? Captain, Kett and Mo just draw enemy fire. That's fine. -Captain... -I heard you, sergeant! Wait and have it out here. Leave me alone, will ya? Come on, Lonnie! You want this? You got it! Luther, hat the hell's the matter with you? -Lonnie! Bluebellies! -What are you talking about? The bluebellies are close enough to stick it in our backs and break it off, boy. They're firing at Kett and Little Mo right now! [DISTANT GUNSHOTS] We almost home, boy. This war's most over with. Who said that? -[PANTING] -Not me, captain. I said it, captain. This war will never be over. Whether we like it or not, we'll fight this war for the next 100 years. Till all Yankees or no Yankees live in the south. [DISTANT GUNSHOTS] -Let me go. -There's no horse for you. The Union soldier you just killed. Let me have his horse. [LOCK CLICKS] [CLATTERING] What about this, cap'n? What are we waiting for? Are we gonna get out of here? Why, of course. Loonie, ake the men and ride to the first cover south of here. I'll wait for Kett and Little Mo. Now, Lonnie! You too, Pru. -I'll be along. -But why? Because I'm in command here and there's a war on! You require other reasons, Pru? I said you require further satisfaction, lieutenant? Captain. [GUNSHOTS IN DISTANCE] Aren't you gonna kill me? That's what you said, wasn't it? Next time we're alone? [GUNSHOTS CONTINUE] Any one of those could be going through your major. Know something? You were right. Yankee wasn't a deserter, he was a dispatch rider. War's over. [GROANS] Ah! [GROANS] [SCREAMS] [SNIFFLES] [PANTING] No! [GROANS] [MOANING] [SOBS] [GUN CLICKING] [GRUNTING] You see, Miss Emily, you're like all of us were. You think nothing like this can ever happen to you. Well, it can! It's happened to a whole country, my country. And there was nothing I could do to prevent that, no matter what. No matter how I fought! No matter what. And now there's nothing you can do. And you're lucky! [SNIFFLES] Because your humiliation will be over soon. But here between us... you and your major are going to know I won. He'll live long enough to know I won. There's only two of them. Blue Lake, see if you can round up those horses. Billy Cat, up to the top and cover him. Say, boys! It's me, Billy Cat. The Yankee from Missouri. What's he saying? What's he saying? [GUNSHOT] Mr. Kettlinger? Oh! Mr. Kettlinger. Get away, boy. One of us got to go tell the captain. Now watch me hit his belt buckle. -Mr. Kettlinger? -Get away, boy! Pick him up! [SOBS] They killed Kettlinger. And they're coming! [HORSES WHINNY] I don't think I can take much more of this. You've been saying that for four years now. Well, so have you. I know, but I'm finally beginning to mean it. -What's the trouble? -Major, we can't take anymore. -We can't go down that hill. -No, sir, we can't. You what? I reckon we can. Huh? [HORSE WHINNIES] [HORSES WHINNY] [WOMEN SPEAKING SPANISH] -[SPEAKS SPANISH] -What does she want? Sir, they're women, more or less. I don't think they know. All right, post your sentries and water your mounts. And don't get too comfortable. -Yes, sir. -Blue Lake? Come on. You. Come on. [SPEAKS SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SOBBING] [SOBS HYSTERICALLY] WALCOTT: Bentley? -[SOBS] -[MEN CLAMORING] -[SPANISH MUSIC] -[SHOUTING] -MAN: Hey! -[CLAMORING CONTINUES] Major, they found a dead Yankee out back. Lucas Day, dispatch rider from Ft. McCloud. -What? -Dead dispatch rider out back. It's empty. You know anything about the man who was carrying this? Yes. Captain Bentley killed him. Did you see the captain take a dispatch from here? No. I didn't see any dispatch. [SIGHS] Well... why couldn't it be good news so we could stop chasing them rebs? Sergeant, get the men ready to mount up. -Now, sir? -Now! Yes, sir. All right. Troopers, move! Come on, double time. Let's move it! Out! -How much did you say? -[SPEAKS SPANISH] How much? [CHATTERING] Hey, no, no! I can't see without my glasses. Here, give me back... I wish you would keep quiet... [GIGGLES] [CHATTER AND LAUGHTER] Damn you, men, move! WALCOTT: I said move! Did you hear the major? He said move! Now, come on! Let's get out of here! Hey! Get going! -Any sign of them? -No, we lost them. It's what I thought we were supposed to be about, Dorrit. Losing 'em. Speaking of losing stuff, you've lost all kinds of equipment. Canteen. Tore up your scarf and lost half of it. Be careful what you lose, Dorrit. Those folks won't believe you're a captain anymore. You get the rest of the men. Now, Pru. [HORSES APPROACHING] All right, water your mounts and fill your canteens. Blue Lake. [EXHALES] Hey, if you was a bird and you could fly, where'd you fly to? -I'd fly me straight home. -Me too. Wouldn't you be a-scared to fly? Would you? Me too. Guess we ain't never gonna get home. Major? I don't think they can take this much longer. I mean... [SIGHS] ...leastwise, we won't have to worry about it much longer. We passed Las Cruces a good five mile and a furlong back. They'll catch the Mexican border before sundown. Whether or not we catch them rebs. Major! Major, they're up ahead of us, sure enough. This is Captain Bentley's scarf. They couldn't leave a clearer trail for us if they tried. [SIGHS] Not if they tried. If Captain Bentley crosses the border, will you let him go? My orders are to close with Bentley before he reaches Mexico. My duties end at the border. I had hoped you were more ambitious than that. Emily, those men are fighting for a country. For the entire Union. They are laying down their lives for a cause they already won. Well, I can't help that. I can see men die for their country if that's my duty. But I can't see men die for your honor. Or mine. Now, we'll catch him if we can. But there'll be no crossing that border. One man would. One man would kill Bentley if he had to go to hell to do it. Bentley? Bentley would kill Bentley. MAN: All right, mount up! Mount up! [SHOUTS] Paddy. Blue Lake. Check the flanks. Yes, sir. No, take that flank! -Blue Lake! Blue Lake! -Paddy! Paddy! Let's go, cap'n. There ain't enough of them to stomp us now, captain. Yes, Dorrit, let's go home. If that's where you're fixing to take us. All right, let's move on out. I said let's move out. Yes, as soon as I get me another bluebelly. You wouldn't grudge me that, captain, seeing as all that's passed between us, now would ya? -[GUNSHOT] -[HORSE WHINNIES] Major! Major! Well, what are you all looking at? Major, they kept shooting Paddy. They just kept shooting him. No reason for it. They're just... ornery. You will catch them, major? [SIGHS] Mount up! [WHOOPING, SHOUTING] -We done crossed the border. -[ALL WHOOPING] Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold it now. With the captain's permission, I think we all oughta recollect where we just come from, and thank the good Lord for our deliverance. And for how well we all done and, uh... getting delivered. Captain. Sergeant. Let's all promise to bow our heads in silent prayer. [HORSES APPROACHING] The Yankees. He come across the border. He ain't within his rights. Anybody for riding on out there and telling the major that, hmm? Well, speak up! All right, then. Hide the horses, you all come with me. -Let's go down below. -Why don't we-- No, we have plenty of time for that! Let's move! All right, now remember, pick yourself a man. Just don't shoot that major. Understand? Dan, up behind the dome. Pru, up there. Mo, up front. [GUNSHOTS] [BOTH LAUGHING] There's plenty of cover. Move on out. MAN: Billy Cat, Owelson, Zollicoffer, follow me. [GUNSHOTS] MAN: Major! We've crossed the border. Major, we've crossed. We crossed the border. -What border? -We've come over. We're in Mexico. There is no border. Not anymore. Not anywhere. Major, you don't have... Damn Yankee! [CACKLING] Get down! Mo, keep firing. I said keep firing! Hey, major, what are they doing up there? They getting ready to charge us, those rebel dogs? DORRIT: I said keep firing! Don't you hear me? I don't wanna kill no more, cap. Fire! I should be home now. Is that what you want? All's we wanted was to get home. [GIGGLING] I got ya, Johnny Reb! Go on, get outta here! Ah, come on, Mo. I was only funnin' ya, now. Come on, cut that out! I'm not gonna put my life between them Yanks... and your property no more. -I'm going home. -Mo, get back! Hey, little ole boy, here I am. What are ya looking at? -I didn't mean nothing! -I don't care what you meant. You killed him! Now, get down there! Get! Run, major! Get down! [GROANS] Who's there?! You killed more of us than the Yankees have. I'm putting a stop to it now. I'm calling you out. [LAUGHS] You mean right here in church? That's right, Luther, right here in church. -What about them bluebellies? -They can wait! You got me to... Ah! [LUTHER LAUGHING] [GRUNTING] [SOBS] It hurts. -Luther! -[LUTHER CRYING] The war is over. It's over, it's all over. I just killed you, Lonnie! It's over. It's over. Where's the captain? It's over! [LUTHER SCREAMING] -It's over, it's over! -[GUNSHOT] [PANTS] -Where is it? -Where's what?! The Yankee dispatch. The war's over, isn't it? Try and tell that to the Yankees! I will. Lieutenant! I'm still in command here. What do you have left to command? You betrayed us, Dorrit. For four years we've been fighting a lost cause. Well, that's something. Now you're having us fight for no cause at all. -Lieutenant! -[GUN COCKS] Go ahead. You killed most everyone else. Me, I'm gonna try and save a couple of Yankees. -[PRU GRUNTS] -[BOTH GASP] We got us a reb! -Wanna kill him? -No. You? No. Why don't you just go home and take care of things? We got all kinds of extra horses down there. But if you is winning, you take care of us, you hear? If I ever can, I will. -He's going home. -You wanna go home? Do you? Bentley? [GUNSHOT] No! Tom! The war's over, major. Has been for some time. I showed them the dispatch. It's right here. You just can't believe it, can you? War's over... major. [MUSIC PLAYING]
