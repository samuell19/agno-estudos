[musical flourish] [water sounds] -[whooshing sounds] -[dramatic music] [upbeat music] - [Announcer] From all around the world, actors flock to Hollywood, where those who seek and find their fortune, including this British starlet. - [Actress] Well, it's true what they say, all of your dreams do come true in America. - [Announcer] Thank you. And best of luck with the nomination tonight. - [Actress] Thanks, Tony. - Mercy, move out of the way! - One day I'm going to be an actress in America. - You're such a loser. - Shut up. - [Sandra] A pathetic, sad little loser. I've seen the numbers on the phone bill. Why do you think I have to drink? I know about her! - Stop it! - [Al] I am leaving! - Daddy, no! - [Sandra] Get out! - Daddy, don't go! Daddy, no! The day that dad left, I decided that I would stop at nothing to give my unborn children the best start in life by choosing a father who wasn't a waste man, a liar, an addict, a gambler, abusive, or a cheat. It turns out that for the first 30 years of my life, they were the only men that I met. - When are you gonna grow up? - Fine, fuck off. You're always complaining and nagging about something. Wait, where are you going? - I've had enough. - Come on, Mercy. Oi, this is my car. Mercy. Mercy! Mercy! (upbeat music) - This is it, the first day of the rest of my life. A new chapter. Fuck my 20s. 30, and here I am with my shit together and I can do what I want, when I want, with whoever I want. (door thudding) (Mercy whistles) - Oh, hi sis. - You know, we're gonna have to make some changes around here. I'm just kidding, it's your house, your rules. Anyway, it's nice to see an old married couple still fiery with passion. - I'm gonna... Sorry to hear about Joni, even though he was the biggest twat I've ever met. - Thank you. - So I thought you weren't coming for another week. - Well, I managed to get Joni's mates to take him down the pub and I got my stuff and here I am. So I got you a moving in gift. - You know we're trying to get pregnant again. - But you're not pregnant yet. - Yeah, but I also have work in the morning. - Yes, so do I. (glasses clink) - So how long do we have the pleasure of your company? - Well, I just have to work out the financials, land a big Hollywood job, and then I'm out of your hair. - Now, you do know Mom has a spare room. - Yeah. - [Kendra] Mercy. - Kendra. Well, let's see you go and stay at her house after she shagged your boyfriend. - She didn't shag your boyfriend. - Well, she tried to. It's the same thing. - He was drunk. - Oh, well that's okay then. Anyway, she's always drunk. - Don't say that. You know we're getting her treatment. One of the best doctors in London, Dr. L'Oscar. - L'Oscar. - Well, she's invited you out for Sunday lunch again. You really should come. - You drinking that? - One more stroke could be game over for her. Whatever, night. - Love you. (Mercy singing) - This isn't forever, is it? - Nah, don't worry. She'll have a new boyfriend by the end of the month. - Babe, she is so loud. - I know. - And she can't even sing. - I know! - But maybe she can't hear us. (Kendra giggles) ♪ No, no, no ♪ (soft music) ♪ No, no, no ♪ (soft music) - [Joni] Mercy, please pick up your phone, please. Please look, I know I'm an idiot. I know what I've done wrong, I understand all of that. But please, you don't need to punish me like this. Please just come home. You know I love you. You know I care about you. I've been an idiot. Listen, I will fix everything, I promise. Just call me back. (soft music) - I messed up. I shouldn't have left. What choice did you leave me? I know you killed him, with your bare hands. He was my favorite plant. - Thanks Mercy, that was... Yeah. - Oh, would she really cry over a plant? (casting directors whispering) - That was great, that was really great. This time, if we could try it with an Indian accent. - Oh, you want this in an Indian accent? - Yeah, yeah. It says here on your profile that you can do an Indian accent, so. - Yeah, no, sorry. I usually get some notice. - Whenever you're ready. - I messed up. I shouldn't have left. But what choice did you leave me? He was my, he was, he was... He was my favorite plant. (casting directors whispering) - Where are you from? - London. - No, where are you from? - Oh, so my dad is Mauritian and my mom is English. - Yeah. No, see, we wanted someone that was genuinely Indian. - Okay. Well, if you ever need a half Mauritian, half English actress, then yeah. - Yeah. Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. (bag thuds) I'm sorry. (casting directors whispering) Hey, are you auditioning? - Yeah. - Just say you're Indian and practice the accent. - Really, ugh. They never said. - They never do. Break a leg. - Thank you. - Like not actually though. (upbeat music) - That's why I'm thinking about that digital marketing. (overlapping chatter) - Here you are. Is everything alright with your meal? - Don't I know you from somewhere? Strip club, porno? (flirty customer chuckles) - Sadly not. - Yeah, you were in that film. What's it called, right? Yeah, what was it called? - I'm just a waitress. - That's the one, you played the girl in the pet shop who got her ear axed off. I told you! She wasn't bad, but that film was so shit. (flirty customer chuckles) - Thanks guys. - Oh, Jesus man, look, look. - More fans of yours? - Sadly not. Hey Abdul, can I get a pay raise? (Abdul laughs) - Can I lower your pay? - No, no, seriously. All right, but when Hollywood comes knocking... - Oh, Hollywood. Hello, Hollywood. Hollywood? There's no Hollywood here. Hollywood doesn't just come knocking on anyone's door. You know if you want it, you better get on a plane and go. So why haven't you done that? - Because I'm a poor actor and I live in London. And I work here and people don't even pay service charge. You know, it's like you're trying to get rid of me. - Hell yeah. Years I've had to put out with your canceled shifts, your bad excuses, your boyfriend hanging around like... Do me a favor and just leave before I have to sack you. - Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean boyfriend hanging around? - I think he's drunk, like is he homeless or what? Come on. - Yeah Abdul, see you tomorrow. - Hey Mercy, you not done for 30 minutes! Mercy! Last orders. - Oh mate, is she gone? - Yeah. - But you know, she's an actress. - Gah! (soft music) - He turned up at my work. - That's some fucked up shit, like serious stalker vibes. - Men are like boomerangs. You throw 'em away and they always come back. It's kind of romantic, I guess. - Really, you think serial killers are romantic? - Amber relax, he hasn't killed anyone. - That we know of. Oh, you're not gonna take him back, are you? - Of course not. I'm just gonna concentrate on my career and drown my sorrows in food. - Ladies. - Yes, please. Come on. Another for the fridge. - Right, shots are on me. - Oh no, I've got a big deadline tomorrow. - Yeah, I've gotta be up early for a shoot. - We just wanted to make sure that you were okay and that you weren't going to do something stupid. - Life is too precious. - No, I meant like jumping into another relationship. It's okay to be on your own. - Of course. I mean, it would have to take someone very special, someone romantic and ambitious and funny and tall, dark and handsome. Oh, but I have learned, I've learned that guy does not exist. - Preach. - No, you don't get saying this because you've started seeing Jaxon again. What is it, like 18 months without commitment? - At least I can get a date. - Well, that was a low blow. - I mean, you are having a go at me about Jaxon, but you don't go out with anyone. - Look, I'm busy and important at work. - All I mean, Amber, is look, you are so attractive. You're just wasting it. You could be going out there on dates, having fun, meeting men. - I don't want to meet any weirdos online. - They're not weirdos. - I think they are. - Look around you. Everyone nowadays is on a dating app. She's on a dating app. He's on a dating app. They're probably on a dating app date! - Thank you. - Enjoy. - I don't want to sleep with any of these people. They look a bit weird to me, in this all dressed so intensely. Just no. - How else are you gonna meet someone? - The right person will come along. - We don't live in that world anymore. The right person is on a dating app. - Look, I just want you to find somebody who will treat you right and respect you. Who texts you back, that's not Jaxon. - Oh my God. - What? - I think my first rebound just walked in the door. - That's Jaxon's friend. I'm gonna text him, I wonder if he's coming to. - Ow! - What happened to you concentrating on your career? - Oh, I'm just... I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna... Excuse me, excuse me. (soft music) Yes, nice and subtle. Hi. - Well, I'm gonna go. Are you coming? - No, I'm gonna wait to see if Jaxon gets back to me. - Give up. - So what, you just work and that's it? - That's it. And you, what's it like being an actress? - Well, it could be better. - I'm always intrigued by people that take a career in the creative industry. You must have such resilience and bravery. But she look like the sort of person that succeeds at everything that she does. - Nope, and I am particularly bad at sports. - Well, I've actually got a friend who owns a boxing gym. They've just started doing classes, so maybe you can come through some time. Not that you need it. We can go together? - I am so horny. I avoided having sex with Joni for months, but I can really go for it right now. Don't look at his crotch. Something about his beard, I could just, oh. - I'm sorry, am I boring you? - Oh, I... - Your little friend still hasn't texted me back. And I know you think I'm too good for him, but I checked his birth chart online and he is my top match. Plus that psychic lady told me I was gonna meet a guy whose name began with J. Anyway, this is all happening though 'cause Mercury is in retrograde obviously. Anyway, I'm going home. - No, you are not driving. - I'm fine. - You're almost definitely not, I'll drop both of you. - No. - Yes. - I don't want to be dropped off. - Your bag. (Kristina gagging) Try and avoid my shoes. - Sorry. - Why are you drinking so much, Kristina? - Because of your stupid friend. - Yeah, he is pretty stupid. Don't phone him. - I'm not going to. I'm too good for him anyway. - Listen, come join us in the car when you're done. - You all right? (Kristina groans) - Well, Kristina is having the time of her life. - Oh, sorry about my alcoholic friend. - She's not an alcoholic, trust me. - Well, I hate the sound of sick. I was trying to put some music on, but I just couldn't do it. Oh my God, what is this? - I'm so sorry. It's not my car. - No, I like it. Oh. - Actually it's pretty cool. - Yeah. - I think it's pretty cool. - Okay. Well I tried to- - Oh my God, I think I just saw yesterday's breakfast. - Thanks for dropping me off. - It's a pleasure. (soft music) - Okay, good night. (soft music) - Hey, Mercy. I don't think I got your number. - I think I left it upstairs in my room. - I think I might like to take you out for dinner first. - That would be nice. - Good night. Have a good night. (upbeat music) - Late for very important meeting with bougie director friend. She's very successful and important in the British independent film industry. Tessa, how are the kids? - You're late. I hate it when people are late. You know, if you weren't female, BAME and in your 30s, I wouldn't still be here. - Of course not. - Well, I've only got five minutes now before I meet my big hotshot investor. - Oh, hotshot investor. Are there any... - Are there any roles for you? Mercy, you can't just ask that as a first question. You need to be asking questions like, what's the film about? Or, what's the higher concept? Not are there any roles for you. - Are there? - Tessa, darling! - Hi, Angelina. - Hey, can I get a selfie? - Okay, hun. - That's your hotshot investor? - I've got mouths to feed now. - Darling, it's been so long. I booked a table at Annabelles. I am just craving a yellowtail tiradito. Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there. Angelina, and you are? - Mercy. - Nice to meet you. - We know each other. We were in "Misguided" together. - Oh my goodness, Mercy! Well, you are not 20 anymore. - Congratulations on your- - Yes, yes, thank you! I'm humbled you like it. Four BAFTAS and talks of Emmys! Writing that show was life altercating. So how's your career? - Well, I've had lots of auditions and I'm represented by Envy Management. - Oh, not them. I was with them years ago, still pushing those corporate jobs. - Actually, we're working on something together. - You are? - Yes, Mercy is cooking up something pretty special. And she's also a talented writer. - Invite me to the table read and I'll bring my friends from the National down. Get 'em off my back for a while, you know? Anyway, it was lovely to see you, Mercy. Oh, I almost forgot! I have a premier tomorrow at 5:00 PM, bring your friends. Say you'll be there! - I'm not sure if I can- - Oh, she can have my invitation. Daniel's got origami lessons and Nathan wants to build a snowman. Don't. - Good luck with the script. Tessa darling, are you coming? - Yes, you go get the table and I'll just settle this. - Ciao darling, ciao, mwah! - Ciao. - Ciao. She's not that bad. - Tessa, I don't know how to write. - Well, learn. Opportunities, don't come knocking unless you've built a door. See all the shit I have to do to be a success? Write your truth and I want 20% of it. Oh, and remember my showcase on Friday. I have got some big casting director that wants to meet you. - Tessa, you are the best. - Oh, I know. - [Mercy] Great, I've not done creative writing since X amount of years in school. Yet, acting career seemingly depends on it. Kristina and Amber escorting me to schmooze at Tangerina's fancy film screening. In worse news, two months post breakup and have actually gained 15 pounds. Oh, I'm already a century older than majority of singles. Time to write my truth. My truth. What is my truth? - Come here. Come here. Come on, we're gonna miss the film. Where's Amber? Why do you look so good? - Well, we're here for the networking, not for the film. Anyway, how many likes do you think it would take to be the most eligible Bachelorette in London? - Honey, did you just join a dating app? You're gonna have sex! - Well. - Are you going on a date tonight? - No, but look how many likes I got. - 9,000. And look at all of them. All awful. Out of 9,000, maybe five are gonna be alright. Oh, look at this shit. - Yeah, well, I wasn't actually gonna go on a date. I'm just gonna enjoy being popular and read my messages. Oh, there she is. - Hi. - Hey. - It's Mercy Pierre plus two. - Hey bitches. - About time. - Sorry, I have a Mercy Pierre, but no guests. - What? - Oh no, Angelina said that I could have two guests. - We're at capacity, sorry. - Oh, well. - Damn it. - No, no, no, she said... Oh, she's coming in. (fans hollering) Hi Angelina. - She ignored you. - No, she didn't, she's just busy. Do you mind if I? Hey, Angelina. Angelina, hi. Sorry, my friends aren't on the guest list. - Uh huh. - Angelina, sorry, my friends are there. I just need you to get us in. Is it okay, you said that I could bring two guests. Such a bouncy flow. Where'd you get it done? My two friends there, they were meant to be on the guest list. - Sorry darling, the guest list is full. - Oh, but they're just two cute ladies there so we can get them in, can't we? Bring someone, so that'd be good. - Get rid of them. (fans hollering) - Excuse me, do you mind? (fans hollering) What are you doing? Remove them! (fans hollering) Faster! (fans hollering) (upbeat music) - Oh, this is so much better. - I prefer the premiere. - Oh, hurry up and get famous so we can have our own premieres. Whose phone keeps going off, it's annoying. 9,000 likes. How's the 9,000 dates? What happened to that Michael dude? You two were looking pretty cozy the other night. - Please don't date Jaxon's friend. Imagine if you two get married and we're still not even a couple. - He didn't message me anyway. - Oh, that's a shame, he was cool. I might check out that boxing gym he was harping on about. Only one match. Who's this? Mr. USA, huh? - I was looking for ages and he's the only one that seemed okay. - Blake, 29, recently moved from New York to the big smoke. Architect, works in the city, likes good food, great friends and discovering new things. - Mercy will show you plenty of new things. - And give killer back massages. - So he sounds like a player, right? - Wait, he messaged! - Wait, no, give me that! Give it back! - What did he say? - You're gonna have to keep it down. - Hey, you live in East too? We definitely have to meet for a drink! When are you free? - No! - Hold her. - No, give it back! (overlapping chatter) - Ladies, we're getting complaints. - From who? - You're gonna have to leave. You're just too rowdy. - Sorry sir, but our sad, lonely friend here needs a rebound shag after she left her awful scrub boyfriend. We're trying to set up a date for her tonight before she becomes a virgin again. - It's 6:00 now. Tell him 7:00 PM at the Crooked Well. It's the perfect first date spot. It's where I met my man, and look. - Aw. - Romantic. - It's a great spot. - Sent. - Yes! - I'm going home with my phone and I'm gonna figure out how to write a damn script. And if you must know, it's about a girl who's muntinized by her friends in a burrito bar. - Don't be like that, we're just trying to help. - It's not helpful. I've been on these date before and it's just a bunch of boring, standard guys with nothing interesting to say. Good night ladies. (phone dings) - He messaged. - See you then, I'll be wearing a yellow corsage. Oh, he's sweet. - Oh. - Right, let's get her ready for action. - Yes! (upbeat music) - This is fine. Smile, be chatty, be flirty and leave. Smile, be chatty, be flirty and leave. What was his name again? Oh, a message from Blake. Blake, yeah. Okay, cool. Just be cool when he gets here. Oh- I'm so sorry. - Let's try it again, shall we? - That would be great. - Sorry I'm late, I had to get you this. - Oh my God. I can't believe you actually got me this. - Well, I wanted to get you a yellow corsage, but they didn't have it at the station. Let's have a drink. - Okay, so he's calling your awkward. Okay, all is not lost. Let's have a good look here. So dress sense is American. Ears are cute, goes to the gym. Eyes are dark, mysterious. Oh, I'm sinking. I'm falling, who am I? The gym? - You want gin? - Prosecco is fine. - You look very pretty today. - Oh, thanks, so do you. - Well, I tried my best. I'm really honored to be sitting with a real actress. - Oh, well, it's not the easiest of careers, but it's worth it. - I'm very impressed by you. And I really like movies, so maybe that could be our next date. Thank you. - Thank you. - Cheers, to us. (Mercy giggles) Thank you. Yeah, well I've only been here for three weeks. I'm kind of still living out an Airbnb, until work sorts out my apartment. - So are you gonna be here long? Don't come across too keen! - My contract's six months, but I can definitely extend it if I wanted to. So we'll see. - So have you been single for long? Oh God. - It's a bit complicated. I've only ever had one girlfriend. We were together for nine years. Grew up in Arkansas, then moved to New York and then my mom passed. Yeah. - I'm so sorry. - I didn't handle it too well. This was two years ago. - What happened? - Cancer, again, complicated. But let's just say I'm here to start fresh. - I know the feeling. - You want kids? - Eventually. You? - Definitely. - I want to live in LA first. - Mm, I have friends that live in LA. They've been asking me to come work for them for years. (Mercy squeals internally) - Oh my God. You can't kiss me with cheese in your mouth. Wait, what just happened? Someone tell me what just happened. - Sorry guys, the bar is closing. - Oh my God, it's 11 already. - Already? - Can I get the bill please? - The gentleman settled it earlier. - Let's go. - So do you know London well? - Embarrassingly, no. - Well, I happen to be famous for my tours. - Is that right? - Do you know who that is? - I do not. - It's William Shakespeare. He wrote some plays. Yeah, they're all right. - Oh, I've heard. - And this is a church. - Is that right? - And you see that stone there? - That one? - No, that one. - Oh yeah, right. - That's where they beheaded Anne Boylyn. - Really? - Mm-hmm. And don't think those traditions have changed, oh no. Old Lizzy still beheads people sometimes. - Is that right? - Many Americans who are tall and semi-good looking. - Oh, only semi-good looking? - Mm-hmm, don't worry. I won't let her touch you. Here is London Bridge. - You didn't know that. - I actually did this time. - There's a sign right here. - No, I really knew this one. - Are you cold? You're shivering. - Uh-huh. And this is the river. - I see that. Now what? - I owe you a drink. (upbeat music) - What is this place? - Its where Harry met Meghan, of course. Oh God. Fuck off. - What was that? - Nothing. (upbeat music) I'll be back in a minute. Don't mess this up. I have to go. - Really, why? - You have work in the morning. - I'll be fine, I just want to be with you. - Pushy. I really have to go. - There's something you're not telling me. - Yes, I've fallen in love with you on our first date. I'm tired. - You want me to come back to your place, is that it? Okay, come back to my place. - It was nice to meet you. - Is your cab here? When can I see you again? - Next week. (upbeat music) Yeah, so I'll be with you in a minute. - Mercy, what time do you call this? - Not now, Abdul. I just want to get through my shift and go back to bed. - Mercy, Mercy! - What? - The gentleman wants his bill. - Yes. - What's the matter with you? - I'm a broken woman. - Sorry? - Last night I met the man of my dreams. He's literally everything I ever wanted in a person. I had butterflies, butterflies! You know, the last time I had butterflies, I hadn't even started my period yet. - [Abdul] Well, that's great. - No, it's not. I mean, it's the best thing and the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I have this weird energy I can't shake. I feel sick. I haven't eaten since yesterday and I'm not even hungry. And then I sent a message to all of my friends and family saying that the American that I met for six sweet, sweet hours I'm gonna marry! - Now the whole restaurant knows. Guess what? Nobody cares. - Don't you understand the importance of this? I've been awake since 5:00 AM and I've checked my phone every five minutes. - You've been awake since 5:00 AM and you're still late! - It's taken over my life. Help me, help me. - Help me. - Well, what do I do? Do I wait for him to call? I mean, he asked me to go back to his last night and I said no, but I wanted to Abdul, I really wanted to. - Isn't this a conversation for your girlfriends at home? - What if I never see him again? What if he doesn't call? My entire future happiness with the man of my dreams depends on this one text message. - Why don't you just ask him out? - Really? - Yeah. If you want him, go get him. - Don't ask him out. - Forget this guy, he just fancies you. - Whatever. - Are you sure? I don't want to mess this up. - Yeah, definitely. What's the worst that can happen? - It's on me. Okay, no exactly playing it cool, but he said yes. Must be as keen as I am. Oh, still lost my appetite. All I've managed to eat in 24 hours was an overpriced flump and six prawn crackers. Wait, is that Michael? Oh, I forgot how sexy he was. I'm not usually into beards. But you know what, not that it matters, taking my number and not texting me back. The cheek! His loss. (upbeat music) Hello? - You look very pretty. Turn around. So what's the screening about? - Oh, it's just an industry thing for my director friend. - Wait, what's this? - What's what? - This. - Buckingham Palace. - Get out, the Buckingham Palace? - Yeah. - You know, my mom always wanted to go. I just haven't been been around to it yet. - Oh, well we don't have to go to the screening. - No, don't be silly. We can't let your friend down. - I wonder if the queen's in. (Tessa breathes deeply) - Well, don't you look stunning. - Oh, thanks for coming Agatha. It's good to see you. - It looks like a full house. Is that everybody? - No, we're just gonna wait a few more minutes. That actress friend I told you about, she must have got caught up from work or something. - It's fine, I look forward to meeting her. - My dad's gonna love these photos. - You have a close family? - You don't? - Well, my dad walked out on us when I was eight and I never saw him again. - I'm sorry. And your mom? - I've not spoke to her in years. - But she's your mom. - Yeah well, moms are supposed to make you feel better, not worse. - You know, all I know is that one day, that last call you're gonna get, it's gonna be the last call. You don't want to miss it. - Oh, it's amazing, well done. - Thank you. - Congratulations, amazing show. - I loved it. - Thank you so much, it was lovely. - Congratulations! I loved it, that was fantastic. I'm so proud of you. And what happened to that superstar actress you mentioned? - Traffic. - Huh. ♪ 'Cause we run deep ♪ (upbeat music) ♪ I'll be there in a heartbeat ♪ ♪ Intentionally hurt you ♪ ♪ Like one, two, three, you can always count on me ♪ ♪ Listen to me, so fun ♪ ♪ Intentionally hurt you ♪ ♪ I'm never, never gonna ♪ (indistinct singing) - You really did just get here. - You sleep well? - Yeah, you? - Yeah. Sorry, my body clock hasn't fully adjusted yet. - I'm gonna go. - Sorry if I seem a bit preoccupied, just thinking about my apartment. - [Mercy] You get in today though, don't you? - Actually, I'm going home tonight. - What, like back to New York? - Arkansas, annual golf trip with my dad. - All right. So are you going for long? - A week. But I was thinking of taking a trip to Greece. Have you been? - Yeah. - Maybe you can give me one of your famous tours. Bye. - Bye. - [Amber] Hurry up! - I can't go to a class without breakfast. - You know you're not meant to eat less than an hour before working out. - Watch me. - That's the most attractive I've ever seen you. (door buzzes) Who's that? - Guess. Good morning, Miss Pierre. - You mean Mrs United States. - She saw the American last night and she didn't tell us. - He asked you out? - Well... - It wasn't a booty call, was it? - No, of course not. - So you haven't slept with him yet? - Oh, she had sex with the American! Is this not the best day of your life? - Oh, intoxicates me. We're literally high in each other's presence. No seriously, it's like heaven on earth. And does he call me thanking me for an amazing night? No. - Well, if he hasn't texted by midnight, it was a booty call. All right, walk and talk. - Where are you going? - We are going to knock some sense into you. - Shall I message him? - Definitely not. - Come on. (upbeat music) - Use the jab to get him away! (upbeat music) (door creaks) - They sold it a little differently online. - He's online, he's actually online. - This is great. - Get your head in the game. - Hello, Cinderella. My name's George, I'm the coach here. Listen and get your gloves on. - Amber, give me my phone back! - You have to play it cool. - Amber, give it back! - You're gonna have to fight me for it. - I'm actually pretty good at this. - Oh, I feel funny. - Take the anxiety out on potato head. - I beg your pardon? - She's a twat, you're gorgeous. - Oh, I'll let you off. - It's been what, three hours since you left? Give him a chance to play it cool and if he doesn't call you... - I feel sick. - You're pregnant. - I'm not pregnant, Kristina. I've just not eaten. - See, told you, breakfast. - Oh, I've had no appetite for like 60 hours. - That is weird. - Ladies, keep your guards up! - It's too late for that! - I'm not entirely comfortable with a secret trip away. - It wasn't a secret trip away. He just didn't mention it until after we had sex. And then in the same breath, he asked me to go to Greece with him. - How romantic. - It just doesn't make sense. I mean, first of all, he's all on you. Then you do the dirty. And then all of a sudden, he's going away. - It's not like that, is it? - Have you ever considered that he might have an American lady in New York? (Mercy groans) - Are you okay? - Ah, is it bad? - (indistinct) down, went down. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (George groans) (ear ringing) - Well, her heart rate and breathing are normal, so she should come around shortly. - Hot lips. - I think she's gonna be just okay. The bleeding stopped, so just give her plenty of water. And by the sound of it, some food. - Michael, I think George might need looking at. - Sure. - Come on, we've got to go. - Why? - You want to stick around and see what an angry boxing instructor looks like? - What happened? Come on. (upbeat music) - [Michael] Mercy, wait! - I'll bring the car around. - I'm not sure I'll come back here again. - Kristina! - What, are you like Superman or something? - Far from it. You think I have hot lips? - Well, I'm clearly concussed, and so are you. I mean, I did think you were gonna call me, but you, know I didn't have your number, so. - I know it's a poor excuse, but I've been very busy at work. Do you like the opera? - Nope. - Fine, I know you don't like classical music either, but maybe I can change your mind. I've got a friend who is a creative director. How about I get us some tickets for next week? - You know what, don't dangle the opera in front of me. I know an empty offer when I hear one. - Jesus, tough crowd. How about tonight? - I can do tonight. - Great, I'll pick you up at six. (upbeat music) ♪ A thousand times we've tried ♪ ♪ A thousand times we've died ♪ ♪ What's for me is for me ♪ ♪ What's for you is for you ♪ ♪ I'd take fruit tonight, them too ♪ ♪ You grow fruits and I cut them loose ♪ - [Mercy] 10 Hours since I left his hotel. My throat is thick with dread, At 30 years old, can I still be tricked into bed? Sucked in with those compliments and those gorgeous brown eyes. No sign of any girls. - Oh my God, who are you stalking now? Is that that guy from that gross kissing photo you sent the other day? - Oh my God, shut up. (Mercy gasps) Oh, it's him now. Hello? - Hey star, it's Michael. I know I said about tonight, but I've just received an emergency call. I'm not gonna be able to make it. - Okay, well, do you wanna do another day instead? - I'm sorry, I can't talk now. I will have to make it up to you. (soft music) - Don't you think that you should get a break from men? - No one wants to date me anyway. - How's work? But if you spent more time on acting rather than dating, then... - Oh my God, you are fortunate enough to have married your high school sweetheart, so please fuck off. - Anyway, what's this about you blocking mom? You know, she's invited you around for dinner again. - Oh, that's nice. - So are you coming? - No. - Mercy, she's not well. - Yeah, in the head. - Potentially, yeah. What if something really happens this time, huh? If it does, then you are really gonna regret not- - You know what, if something does happen, I don't see how it's my fault. I don't make her drink. I don't make her act the way she does. You know, it's like, why does she even bother having kids in the first place? Some people just shouldn't be parents. - How dare you? How can you say that not everyone should be parents? What, you think she doesn't deserve it? What, you don't think that everyone deserves at least a chance? At least a chance! I can't do this anymore. I can't go through this again. Work is insane and Zach is just... - Hey, hey, hey, what's happened? - It's happened again. - Oh my God, I'm so sorry. - What if... What if we don't... - You will. Okay? It might take time, but it'll happen. And don't worry about mom. I'll go see her, okay? - You promise? - I promise. Okay. (soft music) Hello, Mom? - [Sandra] Hello. - Mom, where are you? I'm outside, it's Mercy. - [Sandra] Sorry, I can't hear you. - Mom, it's me. I'm outside the house, where are you? - [Sandra] Only joking. This is the voicemail of Sandra, please- - Cheers. - This looks fun. - Mercy! This is my friend Ed. He gets his hair done at the salon. - Hello, Ed. - Nice to meet you. - What are you drinking, Ed? - It's non-alcoholic. - I was talking to Ed. - I think I should leave. - Oh no, don't go. I thought you were staying over. Call me. Bye Ed. Well, this is an unexpected surprise, darling. - Kendra had a miscarriage. - Oh no. Oh, my poor girl. She's been under a lot of stress lately. - Yeah. And she'd be under a lot less stress if she wasn't paying for an expensive addiction specialist. How is that going, by the way? - If you are insinuating that I'm to blame, you are greatly mistaken. These things happen! I'm not saying it's okay, but she has a very difficult job. You won't understand with the acting stuff. Their relationship is suffering with you in the house. She'd never let on, but she carries a big burden looking after you. But that's our Kendra. - I am not the burden! And I pay my way. And the reason she's so together... She had a childhood, didn't she? - I know, and I'm sorry about that! Please, can't we try again? - I've got plans tonight. I came to see if you're okay and you're not. - It's just a stupid one off! I'm sober, I swear! Mercy, wait! We have to face our problems, not walk away from them! - [Mercy] After a predictably terrible reunion with mom, I decided to get back to the real tragedy of my life. A good defense, after all, is the best offense. For 10,000 matches and counting, it would be rude not to work my way down the list, starting with the wild card. - Bloody game! Oh, I hate this game. I can't even get past this level. - Why are you playing it then? - Twatziller Do you want a go? Maybe you'll be luckier than me. - Trust me, I'm not. Tess, hi, I'm so, so sorry about yesterday. - [Tess] Whatever, it's fine. I'm helping out a casting director friend and managed to get you an audition for the lead. - Oh my God, Tess, thank you so much. - [Tess] I sent you the time, location, and sides. Don't let me down. - I won't, I promise. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. - For fucks sake, hey, don't be unsocial. - You know what, I'm gonna go. - Pussy. - What did you just call me? - Capital P, pussy. - Right, what the hell do you do? - Well you press start, yeah, obviously. And then you go. - Okay. Like that? - Yeah, just like that, yeah. - Okay, and you just go over that thing. And just like that. Woo! Boom, done it. - Woo, isn't that great? First time, ah. Can we play another game? - [Mercy] Say no, say no, say no. Go and prep the audition. - Okay. Now it is your turn. - I think I have it this time. - I very much doubt that. - No, I really think I do. - Oh, would you look at that? You've won again. - Yeah, won again. Yay! Do you have any more games? So what do your parents do? - I dunno. Actually, I don't even know. You have got a sexy nose. - Ow! - Oh, sorry, sorry. Baby gonna get bruises. (phone buzzing) Who is Blake? - Oh my God, give me my phone. - Your husband? Am I your bit on the side, Grandma? (Mekel groans) - Oh my God, I'm sorry. Where's your bathroom? - That one! (phone buzzing) - Hello? - [Blake] Hey stranger. - Hi. - [Blake] I just wanted to say I had a great time last night. - Why, what happened last night? - [Blake] Don't tease me like that. - So you must be on the way to the airport by now then. - [Blake] Actually, I decided to push it back. I'm still out my apartment and my dad didn't mind, so. - Really? - [Blake] I was wondering what you were up to this evening. - Oh, I'm just chilling with some friends. - [Mekel] I've got another game, grandma! - [Blake] You wanna come out? If you don't mind leaving your friends, that is. - You ready for our final game? Third time lucky. - Uh, it's late. - Wait, wait, wait. Should I call you? - Probably not, unless you want to go to a casino. I think you're my lucky charm. - Yeah, I'm a lucky charm. Yeah. (Mekel groans) - Well, look who it is. - We meet again. - Let's go in. (upbeat music) (group chattering softly) - Hey, would you like another drink? - Get off me, creep. - So are you all moved in yet? - Not yet, it keeps getting delayed. It's such a drag. - So why did you wanna come here? It's a bit random. - Because I wanna see you dance. - What? What do you mean you wanna see me dance? - I wanna see you dance. What's so confusing about that? - So you were just sitting in your Airbnb and you thought you'd just call me because you wanna see me dance? - Well, not just to see you dance. (upbeat music) Come on. - Should we get a drink or something? I mean, if architecture doesn't work out, you'd make you a really good stripper. - Thanks, I think. (upbeat music) Oh, you're not too bad yourself. (upbeat music) - Oi! - Oh my god, Joni! What the fuck? - It's only been a week and you're already messing around with someone else! What's wrong with you, slut! - You know this guy? - Yeah, he's my ex. - We're not done here! - Let's get out of here. - Do you wanna wait until he is gone? - No. - Call it a night, fella. - Go home. - Just a sec. Joni- - Just fuck off. - When are you gonna sort yourself out? - I'm the one going out of my mind in our flat. And you're shagging around. - Go home, Joni. - I tried. Mercy. I tried. I know you think I didn't, but I tried. We could have gone all the way. I need... (Joni snorts) - Get home safe, Joni. That was weird. - Yeah, thanks for introducing me to my first bar fight. - That's not a normal thing. This is amazing. - You're amazing. Come with me, back to Arkansas. - What? - I know it's crazy, but I really want you to meet my dad. - I... - You don't have to worry about anything. We'll figure it out tomorrow. I just don't want to leave you. Is that crazy? (upbeat music) - You look happy. Did you actually get an acting job? - Fuck! - Mercy! (Mercy groans) - I'm so sorry. Tessa. - Hello, Mercy. - I didn't realize that- - This is Agatha, Agatha Garrett. - Fuck. - I was hoping to be introduced to you at the screening last week, but Tessa said that you had a sudden emergency last minute. - Well, thank you so much for seeing me now. - And so you've read the sides. - Ah, yeah. I don't think... - Hmm? But you have some idea about what the scene is about? - I, I, I, no. - So you've not read the scene? - Well, I sent them to her last night, so there's no reason why she wouldn't. - Do you mind if I see a copy of the script, is that okay? - Here. - I can't believe she's pulled this. - Okay. Okay, so you are my wife. I provide for you and still you disobey me. - It won't happen again, my love. The washing machine broke and then I run out of fairy soap. You know, the kids just won't go to bed and... - Well, you know what to do. - Yes, my dear husband, I love giving you what you want. - On your knees. - My king, let me pleasure you, and then I'll bake your favorite cake. - Great. Can we please see it with an Arabic accent. - Tessa, what is this? - Excuse me? - I mean, like, do you have another scene? You know, where she tells her husband to wash his own bloody dishes? (Agatha laughs) - I'm afraid that doesn't happen in this script. - So she doesn't stick up for herself once? - Oh my God. - I think you need to leave. Now, please. - Okay, well, thank you. I'm going. I mean, she really should tell him to fuck off. - I told you I'm understaffed and I'm underpaid! (overlapping arguing) - You! Seriously, you just run out on a shift? You knew I was short of staff. - I- - No, I don't want to hear it! Listen, go find yourself a job that you actually want to do. - You know what, I quit. (distant chattering) - Listen, I'll call you. Take care. - Yeah, you too. Get home safe. No. - Tessa, I'm sorry. - No! - Tessa, please. - What is wrong with you? If you don't like the scene, then politely decline the role. Don't waltz in and insult me in my workplace. No wonder you don't work. You need to take a good look at yourself. You cannot commit to anything but your own needs. You're selfish, immature, and lazy. - Wow. Wow, is that really what you think of me? I work in a fucking restaurant. Well, I did, but I lost that job coming to your audition, which, well, I wouldn't have got anyway because I don't get anything. I spend hours and hours learning auditions, running around, and I just never get anything! I just have endless failed relationships and nothing, nothing goes right in my life. So, excuse me if I fuck up. - Mercy, we're all going through stuff. It's not all about you. You just insulted Agatha fucking Garrett. I told her you were coming last week. I told her you were ready today and you've let me down twice. You keep saying sorry, but when are you gonna learn? - Whatever. - Where are you going? - [Mercy] Whatever! - [Blake] Hi, you've reached Blake's phone. Please leave a message after the beep. - Hi Blake, where are you? I'm in Greenwich. I'm ready to leave tonight, wherever you want to go. (soft music) Hi. - Hello madam, how may I help you? - Hi, tou know the American guy that I'm seeing? Tall, good looking. Do you mind if I just go up and see him? - Sure, that's no problem. But he left this morning. Moved his stuff to his apartment just before his flight. A nice guy, best you try him there. - Okay, thank you. You don't know where that is, do you? - No, sorry. - Okay, thank you. - [Kendra] Mercy, it's mom. - Kendra. - [Kendra] She's in the hospital. - Kendra, what's happened? (emotional music) - Mercy. - Where is she? Where is she? - It's okay. - No it's not! (overlapping chatter) - Hiya love. - So what was it, it was a TikTok dance? - Oh, thanks. - So I'm trying to understand. What is it you're trying to do? So you come down here. - Yeah. - I don't even know how you got into this position, oh gosh. And then you just started winding your booty like that. Like this one. - No, I was moving my ass a lot more than that. - More than this? - Exactly that. - Oh yeah, I'm feeling it now. You know, I'm gonna get Kendra to do this later. I'm feeling it now. - A TikTok dance. - A TikTok dance and a bottle of vodka. While I've got you here Mercy... Zack. Zack! - Sorry if I gave you a fright. I know you think I'm a rubbish mom. And I'm the first to say I'm not perfect, I'm far from it. But I have got two things right in my life. - Getting drunk and saying sorry for getting drunk. - You and your sister. I know you've hated me since your dad left and blame me for it, but I've never told you all the things he did, and I never will. I don't blame you for not understanding. You are not weak like me. You walk out on everyone who treats you badly, and I am so proud of that. And the way you go for what you want and have never given up on your career. - I've never hated you. I'm not strong. - Come here. - I've messed up everything. Everything. - There's nothing you can't come back from. And I will always be here. (soft music) - All right, are you too sure you're not gonna kill each other? - She survived a social media head injury. I'm pretty sure she's immortal. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - Dr L'Oscar. - Good evening. - Hi. Thank you for coming out so late. - Is Sandra through there? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's through here. Mercy, move. - So you never told me you were my mom's therapist. - I'm a doctor, actually. And you never asked. Are you okay? Thank you. I'm sorry that you had a scare this evening. Relapse is part of the recovery process. And apart from that, I think she's actually doing really well. I don't think there's a chance that she's gonna have a stroke. How are you? - Me? - People underestimate how addiction affects families. Even generations, especially those closest to them. - How do you know? - After I finished medical school, my sister Sarah, she overdosed. And I always wished I could do more. I left my practice and I started a recovery clinic. And the rest is history. - They should be really proud of you. So how does it feel? - How does what feel? - Just to have everything. - I don't have everything. (gentle music) I thought this would make it a little bit more ethical. - [Mercy] After the non-stroke, me and mum worked out a lot of issues. She needed someone to look out for her, so I moved back in. I started dating Michael, which was fun. - Oh. - But he worked a lot, which gave me plenty of time to work on my writing. (upbeat music) It wasn't always easy, but it was worth it. I never heard from Blake again. He could have been anywhere in the world. I had no idea. (upbeat music) Never showed up. (Mercy speaking softly) (upbeat music) - I just wanted to tell you in person. - What? - So the screening room that I use for my showcase, they've started hosting live performances too. I spoke to them about it and they wanna put your show on! - Oh my fuck! - Boys, auntie Mercy has got a present for you. - Shit, I'm sorry, fudge. - That's a pound each, please. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I am so proud of you. I knew you could do it. I've got some mock up posters being couriered over to you today. I think the next few years are gonna be extremely busy for us, so be ready for it. - Thank you. - [Michael] Can I have the ball? - You struck gold with this one. - Hey. - Hey. - Nice to see you again, Tessa. - And you, it's a shame you can't make tonight. - Yeah, it's a bit of a tough night for some of my clients, so it's best I be on call. - Anyway, I'll catch you later. Mwah. Happy New Year, Michael. - Happy New Year to you too. Tessa. Cute kids. - Yeah, they're sweet. - I think that we would make some pretty cute kids, don't you think? - Yeah, well you gotta put a ring on it first. - Well, you don't believe in that nonsense, do you? Didn't your parents put you off? - What, so my parents got divorced I can't get married? - No, that'd be ridiculous. I'm just thinking, what if we wanted to have kids now? - Yeah, but we don't. - What if we did? - You're cute. - You're cuter. - Well, well, well. - She's gonna be okay. - [Kendra] Yeah, she is. - Look who's here. - Oh my God, you look beautiful. - Thank you, I feel like a whale, but we're both just about ready. - Where's Michael? - Couldn't get the night from work, sadly. - Sandra, are you coming too? - Of course, on the lemonade mind. - You're not the only one. - Oh, on that note, better drink up if we're gonna meet this fancy penthouse before midnight. - Where is Mercy, anyway? Mercy? - One sec, I can't find my... ♪ I don't wanna be alone ♪ ♪ I don't wanna sleep alone ♪ (soft music) - Damn, look at you. - There she is. - Okay, okay, let's go. Taxis are triple on New Year's Eve. (group chattering) (upbeat music) (group chattering) (upbeat music) - Guys, it's nearly midnight. Babe, get over here. - I love you. - You made it. - Oh, you look beautiful. Congratulations on the play, Mercy. - Oh, thank you. - Isn't my boyfriend the cutest? Mm, boyfriend. - Shh, not so loud. People might hear. I'm joking baby. - Oh, you guys. If you hurt her... - I'm sorry that Michael didn't make it. - Hey, you came! - I'm Kristina. - I didn't need a dating app. - So I think we should have a toast, mom. - Yes, it's still lemonade like 10 minutes ago. - So let's have a toast to new beginnings. - [Group] New beginnings. - Oh, there's someone looking for you. - What do you mean there's someone looking for me? - Go on. - Why are you acting weird? - Mercy. - What are you doing here? I thought you had work. - I've managed to get out of work. It's cold. - It's freezing. - Okay, let's make this quick. Okay. - Ooh, what are we doing, pilates? - No, I'm trying to propose to you, so if you could stand up, that'll make things a lot easier. - What? - Okay, fine. We'll do it down here. Mercy. Will you marry me? - Are you sure? - I think so, yes. Are you sure? - Yes. Yes! - Yes, yes. Yes. - Oh my God. Oh my God! (Mercy giggles) You're an idiot. - You're an idiot. (soft music) - Well, I hope it wasn't expensive. - Don't lose it. I was hoping... - What? - We could start. - Start... - Trying. (phone buzzing) Aw, ignore it. - What if it's Kendra and the baby. Hello? - Happy New Year. (Mercy gasps) What... - What, is it the baby? - Oh, it's my alarm. Ah, one sec. I'm just gonna use the bathroom. Blake. - Hey stranger. - This is... - [Blake] I know, this probably sounds crazy, but will you meet me? - What? - [Blake] Please? - Where? - [Blake] I'll share my location. - Okay, I'll meet you there. (soft music) - Hey. This is weird. - Yeah, just a bit. - I owe you an apology. I shouldn't have left things the way I did. - Did I do something wrong? - What, no, you're amazing. You were just the first person went on date with and it was all just a bit- - Overwhelming. - Yeah, but I could've handled it better. - Why did you call me here? - I was thinking about you, so I called. - Well I have a boyfriend now, a fiance. - Wow. Are you happy? - Yeah. I wish you'd called. (phone dings) - Fucks sake. - Blake, why don't you straight talk me for once? - Sorry, it's just... - Blake, why did you stop talking to me? - When my mom died, I fucked up. I ended up losing my mom and her, so I moved to London and met you. And when I was with you, I forgot about everything. But when I wasn't with you, all I could think about was was her. - Her. Are you talking about your ex? - Yeah. - And I'm guessing you got back with her. - Yeah. - And I'm guessing it didn't work out. - No. - When? - Tonight. Do you want to go somewhere? - No. You know that this is the fourth time we ever met. - Do you really want to marry me? - I think I need to be on my own right now. - Thank you for being honest. It's yours, you can keep it. (audience applauding) - [Mercy] It turns out Tessa was right, writing a play was a pretty good idea. And I learned a few things on the way, like ghosting of all forms is awful. Whether you're the giver or the receiver, it's not very nice either way. And maybe we should take a little more time to listen, forgive and tell the truth rather than hiding from it. And yeah, maybe I am down to fair relationship number 15, but I found peace in the most important one. Yeah Mercy, you. Not gonna lie, you smashed it. - Hey, I always knew you'd be a star. Don't forget me when you're famous, all right? Staff discount at Leonies for life. I'm out. - No, you're so sweet. - There she is, writer of the moment. I loved, loved, loved your script! This is going to be huge. You should come to LA with me. We can collaborate. - Thank you, but I think I'm gonna stay in London on my own. - You are very funny. - I mean it. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Okay. Can I get a selfie with you? - Yes, of course. (camera clicks) Hi. - Oh shit, sorry. - So do you wanna come for a drink with us? - I'm taking my nephew swimming tomorrow morning, so maybe not. I took some time off. I decided to spend some time with my family. - I'm glad. - Well done. See you. - Well, I guess that just leaves us then. - And me. - Well, obviously. So, what do you do when you have everything, Miss Pierre? - Dinner? - You're always hungry. - Aw. - Well, apart from that one time. - Oh God, don't get started on that again. - Do you remember? - No, I don't remember what you're talking about. - Yes you do. - I have no idea.
