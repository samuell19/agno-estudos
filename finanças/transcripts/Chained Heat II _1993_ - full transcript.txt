On Friday, September 10th at the Superior Court in Central Prague Karen Lotsky was sentenced to eight years at Razik Penitentiary for the possession of an unspecified quantity of narcotics. Despite pleas of innocence from both her attorney and Lotsky herself.. She was dragged mercilessly from the court. Though there were numerous indications that the prosecution had fabricated evidence nothing was ever done about it. Similar charges had been laid by the state against eleven young women in only seven months. More than one of them showing up on a slab at the morgue. All of those charged were deposited at the steps of the infamous Razik prison. A decaying remnant of the communist regime. The fall of communism did not mean the end of Razik. In fact, it was a new beginning for the powers that be at the institution. The new warden, Magda Kassar brought with her an understanding of how to maintain and, in fact prosper in the new political climate. Razik was no longer just a prison. It, too, was a business, now. Razik prison became the model of free enterprise in the new East. But the price of this newly-gained freedom was costing innocent women their lives. It is in this setting that another unsuspecting young woman is about to become Magda Kassar's next victim. Alex? Hey! Moment, please. Alex! Excuse me. 'Your bag, please. Let me have your bag.' What're you doing? Hey. - What's this? - That's not mine. Alex! What is going on here? You are under arrest for the possession of controlled substance in the sovereign state of Czechoslovakia. - Suzanne? - 'Come with us.' No. Alex! Alex! Alex! What are you doing to her? - Suzanne. - 'Alex!' Let me go! 'To the accused, Alexandra Morrison.' On the first count of smuggling a controlled substance within the sovereign state of Czechoslovakia this court finds you guilty. 'On the second count' 'of possessing a controlled substance' 'this court finds you guilty.' On the third count of unlawful flight this court finds you... guilty. 'It is, therefore, the decision of this court' 'that you be sentenced to ten years and hard labor.' 'Such sentence to be carried out' 'at the Razik Correctional Facility' 'with no possibility of parole.' Next. What do we have today? Your little pretty American has arrived. At last. Beautiful. Stand up straight when Warden Kassar addresses you. Softly, Rosa. Such soft skin. So smooth. Are you frightened? You don't have to be. We're all friends here. - 'Aren't we, Rosa?' - Good friends. And we like pretty things like... you. I don't. 'Leave her alone.' - I was only... - Quiet! Yes, Warden Kassar. Alexandra Morrison? American? Yes, Warden Kassar. Drug charge. - A junkie? - No, I'm innocent. I hate junkies! Especially... the innocent ones. So pretty. So young. But take care of yourself. You could catch your death. That should be enough... for now. The warden hate junkies. I am not so particular. I hate everybody. Gently, Rosa. Such a pretty, young thing. Much better than I had hoped for. I didn't set her up so you could have a playmate. Jealous? No, she's here to do anything I wish and you should know your place, my sweet. We all have our roles to play. I keep my side of the deal. Continue to do so. It's the only reason why you're still alive. One word to Interpol, my dear.. 'Go.' 'Ooh-la-la.' Pardon, I-I don't understand what you're saying. I don't know what you mean. It's mine. 'It's empty.' 'It's mine.' Look, please, I don't want a fight. - Fight? - No! No, I said I don't want to fight. No. - Fight! - 'No!' 'Yeah, shake it, honey. Yeah. ' 'Okay.' She could eat me for breakfast. I'm Tina. Carla's Okay. Let's get your stuff unpacked and change. Then we'll sneak down and see Bobo. What's a Bobo? You'll see. Miss Morrison, your sister's parole hearing isn't due up for another 17 months. Mr. Goff... my sister is not a drug dealer. You have to know that. Suzanne... you reentering this country illegally is the problem. Well, I can't leave without her. You're asking me to abandon my sister. Nobody is asking you to abandon your sister. We are doing all we can to help her. Mr. Goff, with all due respect.. Ten years at Razik isn't good for anybody's health. I understand how you feel but maybe, within a few months, we can make... A few months? A day is too long. She has done nothing wrong. This is a nightmare. What happened to your sister is an outrage but what we're up against here is an incredible bureaucracy. Let me help you. But you must know that I am doing all I can to help Alexandra. You have had all the time in the world for due process, Mr. Goff. I'm beginning to lose faith in the system. Then why did you come to me? Because I need a proper visa. I need you to help me out on the case. Your present immigration status.. Czech government will never allow you a visa, I'm sorry. Please, Mr. Goff. I need your help. Alright. Where can I get in touch with you? I don't know where I'll be. - But I will be in touch. - Alright. Good luck, Miss Morrison. Entrez-vous. You didn't bring any red, perchance? Just like you asked. Tina, where does Bobo find flowers in a place like this? Who knows? He's weird. And who... is our little friend? Alexandra, an American. Too pretty, by far. Rosa meat, I'm afraid. Stop it, Bobo. You are scaring her. No, he's not. She's a he? A screw-up. He should have gone to a man's prison 'but they sent him here by mistake.' By the time it got straightened out he was kind of like a pet.. And he does work for Kassar. She's blocked his transfer ever since. He makes clothes for the warden? Isn't that kinda strange? I'll tell you about it later, okay? What was that? Shift change in the laundry. I have to go. It's my job. If you are late, you are in deep shit. But don't worry. Bobo'll take care of ya'. Now... we need to dress you up in something a little more sprucey. I'm not so sure this is a good idea. I'll be okay. Before you work for the warden.. You will work a few days for me. And strip! Have a taste. Listen. Come back tomorrow, same time, same place and maybe I'll show you one of my hidden little secrets. You better run along now. Okay? - Thanks, Bobo. - Bye-bye. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Alright. - I don't understand. What? - Are you lost? No. No, I have a flat right around the corner. Let's go get her, man. Snooping? I'm lost. I have to get back for roll call. Sticking your nose in.. Where it doesn't belong. Maybe.. It gets cut off. You fuck with my plans.. I fuck with your face, yes? Why are you doing this? You think you are so special, bitch? You are nothing.. But an expensive piece of meat. Remember that. Meat, Miss Pretty-face. I could make you... ugly very quickly. Next time, there will be no witnesses. And there will be next time. Understand? Soon. - Who are you? - Hey, let me handle her? Shut up, Nico. Why did you come back to Prague? Is this about my papers? Hey, she talks too much, man. I really want to screw her! - How much do you know? - I don't know anything! 'I think she's telling the truth, Anton.' She doesn't know anything. Let her go. Those are not our orders. The orders were to scare her off, not kill her. 'Why take chances?' You haven't got the guts. Is that it? Hey, I have an idea, let's kill her first.. And then screw her? - Good idea! - 'Bad idea.' - Come with me. - No! - Come on! - Please! I know about your sister. She's in great danger. Trust me. I'll explain later. Now we must go. Now! Then give me the gun. Come in. I need a drink. Whose place is this? Don't worry. It's safe enough for now. Oh, my God. I've never killed anyone before. I'm sorry. Sorry? You saved my life. They killed my sister. Yeah. They did kill my sister.. And they'll do the same to yours. What are you talking about? Look at this. A tape. But it was my sister who turned up on this video.. And she wasn't the first. There were others, all from Razik prison.. Run by a warden named Kassar. When she disappeared, I tried finding her. That's how I got involved with the other guys. But it was too late. She turned up on a slab.. At the morgue. 'Raped..' '...and tortured.' That was her. Karen. And it's not over. There are too many similarities. I was even at your sister's trial. But why? Why Alex? I don't know. I have no idea. All I know.. Is that no one should suffer like she did. Suzanne.. I'll need your help. Come on. A shower will make you feel better. That feels good. 'Die, you bitch!' 'I need you dead!' What is going on? They did it. Junkies. Christ! They were buying from this one.. And then they shanked her. 'We didn't do anything.' We didn't do anything! Forget it, Alex. This is the box. Nobody listen to you here. She lied to the warden, that bitch. Rosa's good at that. We have to do something. We have to keep warm until we get out. Sit down. Keep close. Keep close. It's the only way. This is crazy. No. It's Razik prison. Miss Morrison, this is highly irregular. Please. Kassar is running a whorehouse.. Making porno movies and god knows what else. Inmates like my sister are winding up dead. Innocent women.. Are being set up. We have to do something. You have some evidence of this? This. The girl in it.. Was a Razik inmate. She's dead. I see. You have something to corroborate this? I'll get more. - But.. - I'll be back. 'Miss-Miss Morrison! Miss..' Miss Morrison! I will give you a nice shot.. But you'd better do as I say. This is very bad. She was supposed to be delivered tonight. She said she was going to kill herself. 'Then she run.' To prevent her from suicide.. You kill her? It was an accident. I was angry. 'I realize that, but your temper has left us with a problem.' We deliver the American instead. You're jealous. You think I want the girl for myself. 'I think she could be a problem.' 'I think we should get rid of her.' This is the perfect opportunity. You think.. You think.. And you think. You shouldn't have stabbed the other one. I told you, I got carried away. This is very bad! Relax. Junkies. Junkies always cause problems. 'Of course.' 'Please.' much better. Just do as I say.. And everything will be fine. I have a present for you. Yes. You have to make a decision first. Yes, I want it. You have to make a decision. 'Yes, whatever you want.' 'We need to send him someone.' 'We have to keep him happy.' 'We have to keep him under control.' Yes, I want it. We wouldn't want this to blow up in our faces, would we? No! So, we send him the American. Yes, Rosa. Yes. You can have your present first. But when are you finished.. You give the order. - Yes? - Yes, anything you say. That's the game, isn't it? Yes. Anything I say. - Yes, anything you say. - Play the game, bitch! You want the American, don't you?! No. Don't lie to me. You want the American. - Yes. - But she's junkie. - You hate junkies. - Yes. So, we send her to him. Take the bitch in. Fucking junkies. 'Hurt the bitch!' Tina, what's going on? Don't worry. That's Kassar screaming. She likes to be beaten by Rosa. That girl in the shower.. The one that Rosa killed. What about her? She was wearing an evening gown.. Like the ones Bobo has in his cell. Going to the mansion. I don't-I don't understand. I didn't want to scare you too much. It's your first day, after all. - Please, I have to know. - I told you. Razik is a paying proposition. The mansion is one of the ways it pays. It's a brothel. - 'What?' - Porn movies too. 'Nothing but the best for the mansion girls.' - Did you? - 'Go there?' Yes. I had no choice. Oh, Jesus. It was awful. Every kind of creep you could imagine.. Men, women. I thought.. 'Oh, God.' 'It was so fucking sick.' But I wouldn't do the movies.. Not even to get my sentence reduced. I... wouldn't do that. I'd rather die... than go back there. 'It's okay.' It's okay, nobody's blaming you. So pretty. - Reminds me of.. - Reminds you of what? Nothing. Better times. A friend. Forget it. 'Here.' What did you do that for? Friendship. 'There's been a slight change of plans, thanks to Rosa.' 'So, where are the bitches?' 'Don't worry, I have two new beauties.' They'll be there in the morning. - 'Is Rosa a big problem?' - I'll handle her. 'She was useful.' Yes, she served us well. But she's not as indispensable as she thinks she is. 'Great. What are we gonna do? Find someone else?' There are so many people here at Razik that has friends outside. 'Then, we'll find someone else in Razik.' Right, and they're the ones that can provide us with unlimited amount of women... like Rosa did. 'That's good.' Well, hopefully, we'll have less trouble. We'll see. - 'Well, don't fuck up.' - Of course. Well, you just keep our mutual friend happy. 'We need the girls there now.' I told you, in the morning. 'They are on their way now.' 'And, remember, I want the American girl kept alive.' Alright, then. Goodbye. 'Rosa darling, your days at Razik are numbered.' See that? A pair of shoes. Fight, fight! 'Get in there!' By the pricking of my thumb something wicked this way comes. Back off, back off! Come on! So? She's not there. - We're too late. - Too late for what? Look... if your sister is alive, it'll be hard finding her now. We have to get back to the truck or we'll never get out. 'Come on.' Yeah, but we've come this far. Come on! Accessories should always match your outfit. Quick, follow me. I'm looking for my sister, Alexandra Morrison. - The American. - 'Yes.' Gone to the box, but now the box is empty. We know that. Where is she? My father's house has many mansions. - Where is she? - Forget it. He's crazy. Crazy? You're the one who broke into the prison, not me. Nice shoes. However, I think, I much prefer them in suede. Can you give her a message? If I see her... and if you're lucky.. And if she's lucky. And if I trust you. Just tell her we know what's going on but we need evidence. We need evidence about what Kassar's doing.. And we're gonna' get her outta here. Hey, we have to go, now. Those guys are suspicious enough. Come. 'Wait.' Listen to me. Coming soon, Henry VI Act 3, Part 5, Scene 6, line 67. Remember, 6-3-5-6-67. Sure, whatever you say. Look, we have to go. Say it. No. 6-3-5-6-67. 6-3-5-6-67, okay? Perfect. Now, get thee gone. Okay, come. - Damn it! - We'll try again. Drive! Hey, stay low! What the hell is going on here? Escape. Lukof. The American's friend. What are you talking about? I went to the box. She was gone. I checked the compound, nothing. I talked to the guards. - You're an idiot. - What? She didn't escape. I sent them off together, damn it. Both of them? They are both tagged? It certainly depends on his appetite. If not now... soon. - Turn off the alarm. - Well, somebody escaped. What are you trying to say? In the garbage truck. The gate guard saw her. Shit! Alright, roll call. But now! 'And so, for the disturbances caused earlier today' 'each one of you shall be punished for the actions' 'of one of you.' 'You must learn that if you break the rules' 'you will suffer.' Suzanne... don't you understand? Don't you understand what's going on here? It's over. 'You're going to make it more difficult for her.' 'They know you're back.' That's not the point. 'Face it!' I'm staying. With or without your help. 'So, fuck Razik and you and your corruption.' - Okay. - 'And everything else.' You want me just to leave her here? Is that what you want? Let her rot in that place? Forget it. Look, you know, you don't have to help. 'You can just..' 'go on. Really, it's fine.' I'm sorry, Suzanne. I'm sorry, alright? We'll go together, okay? - Okay. - Fine. I wonder.. What are we gonna do? - I think I'll go talk to Goff. - To Goff? He can turn you in to the Czech police. He'd be stupid not to. - Well, that's all we have left. - That's all you have left. So, that's it? We're finished? My sister winds up on a slab like yours? Well, forget it. Hey, wait a minute. 'If there is another way, we'll find it.' I promise. 'Ladies and gentlemen, no more bets.' 'Mesdames et Messieurs, Le parier son fini.' 'Number five. Numero cinq.' 'Numero cinque.' 'Mr. Perez, you are lucky winner of number five.' 'Ladies and gentlemen, no more bets.' 'Number eleven.' 'Numero undici. Numero onze.' 'It goes to Mr. Beaudier.' 'Ladies and gentlemen, no more bets.' 'Mesdames et Messieurs, Le parier son fini.' 'Numero vingt-trois.' 'Fabulous!' 'Numero ventitre.' 'Number 23.' - 'Congratulations, Warden.' - Thank you. 'You will be happy with your win.' Bye. Ciao. So, I understand you want her. Si. 'Bellissima signorina.' - Then she's yours. - Grazie. She is not for you. Go away. Let's go. Dance for me, bitch. Take off your dress. 'No.' - Yes. - Take off your dress. Leave. - No. - Yes. You do it my way. You are nothing.. But an expensive piece of meat. - Shut up. - You shut up. Kiss me, bitch, kiss me. Meat with pretty face. Maybe... it gets cut off. Yes. That's it, my American girl. You are... cute. Oh, Jesus, no. Not you. That's nice. Big boy. Here. Yes... oh, yes. Nothing but the best for the mansion girls. I'd rather die than go back there. Sh-h. It's okay. What did you do that for? Friendship. Mr. Goff? From the embassy? You were at my trial. Alexandra Morrison. Oh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God. Yes, Alex, it's me. But why so happy? Get up. Magda... get up. Get up! Your little butterfly almost escaped. She found out about her friend, also. And we've got more problems. Where... did this come from? Your little slut sister. 'There's more.' I don't understand, Goff. 'You're screwing up, Magda.' We're gonna have to lay off for a while till things cool down. Now, who gave you permission to be here? I don't need your permission. Sweet little Rosa, you presume too much. You're just a prisoner. 'You lied to me.' You said what? You lied. You kept the American for yourself, didn't you? I don't believe that's any business of yours. But it is. It's our business. We are partners, remember? You were a convenience. You led me to the girls. That's why I chose you. But a partnership? You were never such a thing. It is because of the American. No. It's because of you. You and your friends are lazy and careless! What do you mean? - You know Stefan Lotsky? - Yes. He was my latest recruit. Well, isn't that a shame? 'Fryde and Merlad were found murdered' 'in Suzanne Morrison's apartment.' 'And Stefan Lotsky was seen with this Morrison girl.' 'You fucked up badly, and he's not one of ours.' I don't know. It's a disaster, and you're the cause, damn it! You're trying to cheat me... aren't you? Because of the girl. Well, just remember I could bury you a thousand times over. You and your secret friend! And you need me for other things! No, I don't need you. I have a player... reluctant for the moment but I have a player. And I will teach her the rules. You're a lying bitch! I didn't lie. I told you I wanted her. Don't you ever talk to me that way. I could have thrown you to the wolves any time I wanted! A dozen police forces out there would give a year's budget, damn it to have you in their hands! That kind of threat works both ways, Magda. 'Bobo, he helped the American.' 'That's your fuckup, Magda.' 'I will kill him for you.' 'Better start looking for a new dressmaker.' Why couldn't that jerk Bozo just tell us where to go? - It's Bobo, not Bozo. - Whatever. I don't think we should think about that right now. What were those numbers that he told us? 6-3-5-6-67. - I got it. - 'What?' Henry VI, Part 3, Act 5... - Yeah? - Scene... 6. Line... 67. Let's see. "From this place... the foul waters flow." Great. So what? A sewer outlet? Shit. That's it... a sewer outlet. You're right! And there's one just by Razik. I don't think that Bobo was so crazy after all. 'You're not too good at riddles, are you?' By the time you find this note, I'll have fled from Razik. Bobo. Where is your friend Bobo? 'Anyway, I've learned that Alex is being brought back to Razik.' 'She's in grave danger. You must save her.' 'I've done all I can to help you in this short time I have.' You'll find a present one mile east of the main entrance. 'Goff, are you there?' 'Goff?' Yes? Are you bringing the merchandise? 'Have you packed yours, my little psycho?' 'I'm about to eliminate my biggest mistake at Razik.' 'And once you bring Alexandra Morrison back here' 'her sister is sure to follow.' 'And when they're gone, there's nothing more to worry about.' 'You're not having second thoughts, are you?' No, no. I was just getting ready to leave now. - 'With our pretty package?' - Yes... with my package. - 'Soon?' - At about midnight. 'What a surprise they'll both have.' Two birds with one stone. - 'Then, our vacation begins.' - What about Rosa? It's being taken care of right now. You will have to do better than that, Magda. Yes? 'Warden, Rosa killed your snitch.' - What did you say? - 'She is dead.' Son of a bitch! Find her! 'That bitch is probably going to take care of Bobo, too.' 'I want her back! Dead or alive.' Hey, hey, hey. Hey! You should be so lucky, you bastard! Who's there? Hello? Where did you get it, Alexandra? Oh, Jesus. I know who you are. You're the judge. You're the son of a bitch who sentenced me to this hell hole. We have reviewed your case, Alexandra Morrison. For your crimes against the state.. I now sentence you to death. Screw you, asshole. To a slow.. Painful.. And unremitting death. What do you mean you let Rosa get away for Christ's sake? It just happened, okay? Have you brought the Morrison girl? Yes. Well, good! Now, that's something. That traitorous bitch will get what she deserves. That's nothing! You're letting this whole thing fall apart.. While you sit around like a junkie! - Look, if we get the girl... - 'Forget the girl!' Listen.. It's Rosa you have to worry about. Rosa won't say anything. Wherever she's gone, it'll be worth her life. Magda, you're a psycho. 'We've got murder on our hands.' 'And our homicidal friend downstairs' with his little bag of tricks.. He's not going to take the fall alone, Magda. The only reason he keeps quiet.. Is because I keep promising him girls. We get caught.. They'll put us away for a1000years in a place a lot worse than Razik Prison. Well, what the fuck do you want to do about it? Well.. We could let the judge have his fun. And then, you and I.. We could take care of him. Finish it. Clean up the loose ends. My little psycho. Suzanne. I'm afraid Bobo is not going to show up. No. He'll show up. No, he won't. He was supposed to be here hours ago. And now our place to get in is just swarming with guards. What do you think? I don't know. Well, I'm not giving up. 'Hey... we're not going to.' Without Bobo how are we gonna get into Razik? I mean, they're gonna be expecting us. That's correct, but.. Where's the last place they would expect us? Not the front gates. With what? You'll see. Fight? - Fight. - Yeah. He said she's gone! Shit! Come on! - Sister? - Sister, yes! I'm going to get Goff! Sound the general alarm. Get everybody out. Do a roll call. I'll go to your quarters, I'll get the stuff. You go get the girl. Hey. Be careful. 'Burning the evidence, Goff?' You wouldn't really shoot a man in the back now, would you? Stop! Now, we can work this out, you know? Magda and I have really done very well. And we can make sure that you and your sister.. Can get out of the country. Don't you fucking dare! Now, you wouldn't really use that thing, would you? Why don't you try me? Alright. Bang, bang. - Suzanne, are you okay? - Yeah. 'Over there!' Hello, pretty face. Fucking bitch. Move. Too bad.. Because now you will be my passport out of here instead. The briefcase. Now! Or I'll kill her. You can't get out of here. Let her go. Give me the fucking briefcase! I'm so glad you're okay. In the spring of 1993, the gates of Razik Penitentiary were finally closed for all time. 38 years of corruption mercifully crumbling to the ground. The Superior Court of the Czech Republic found Stanley Goff guilty.. Of kidnapping, extortion, and drug smuggling. The United States government, declining all his requests for extradition. 'For the crimes of murder, torture' rape and kidnapping.. This court finds you.. Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Alexandra and Suzanne Morrison left Prague.. Vowing never to return.
