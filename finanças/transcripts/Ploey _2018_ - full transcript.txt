Subtitles by explosiveskull ♪ Ah, ah ♪ Ah, ah ♪ Ah, ah Look, Mummy, we're finally there! Oh, Daddy, back at last. We safely survived another journey. I'll relax when everyone's safely in the reed bed. Dash two report line of sight. Visual of drop zone, 12 o'clock, all clear. No no, it must be spring, 'cause here they come. Noisy migrating birds ready to hatch more screaming chicks. Why can't they leave us alone? 'Cause they're stupid! Every spring, flying thousands of miles back here. Just to annoy us! Hmm, on the plus side, the migrants do keep us off the menu. Yeah, old Shadow's looking pretty hungry after another tough winter. Let the feast begin. Fetch the decoy. Prepare for touchdown in T minus one minute. Affirmative. Almost home, folks! And we still have the protection of the Sterna! But Shadow is surely waiting! Everyone be ready for my signal! Shadow, old pal! I'd love to help man, but I've got an ache in this knee and a wobble in that wing, look man. Please don't make me do it, they'll just... Skua, you're the greatest decoy I've ever had. Uh, the greatest? Absolutely, now, come along. But the Sterna! All those pointy beaks. I can't take it! They go straight for my tushy. Every time! Every time. Here's the plan. You get the Sterna to follow you. You turn west, and fly like the wind, as usual. But, but, but the pointy beaks and, and, and my tushy, man. But Skua, my dear, your tushy isn't safe down here either. Spring is in the air, Skua. SAM, SAM, 10 o'‘clock 10 o'clock. - Wow! - Take him down! Take him down! Not the tushy! Why is it always the tushy? There won't be any love songs this spring. The Sterna! They've fallen for a decoy! Stay calm, everyone! Remember our practice! On my command. Now, spread out, now! Not going to share, is he? He never does. Incoming, incoming, take cover! Run, hide, hide. I'm hit, I'm hit! We need to take this up with Parliament. Here here, oh, I hate spring so much! We made it. Not everyone. Don't blame yourself. It could have been far worse. And you know it. Ah, exactly as we left it. We have some serious spring cleaning to do. But first, how about dinner and a dance? Have I ever said no? It's a perfect summer morning and the air traffic is running smooth, and no predators reported. In the meantime, whether you're out fetching grubs for the chicks, or at home, feathering your nest, we've got the tune for you. Oh! Oh, come here my dear Ploey! Welcome to the world champ. Mama, Papa. Son today we learn to forage. One day they're an egg. The next they're off digging up their own worms. It's all so fast. Look Papa, look at that. I'm a Sterna, attack, attack! I'm a swan. A Snipe coming. Watch out for the snipe! You're going to fly like a plover. And when we go south across the great ocean, you'll fly right by my side. But why do we have to leave home? Everything's perfect here! Ploey, this is our summer home. But winter would crush us with snow and cold and it'll all be over for the plover. I can't wait to practice flying! You won't have to practice. You're a plover! Flying will happen all by itself, when the time's right. But, survival? For that you'll have to practice. I'm going to be the leader like you Papa, and the fastest plover ever seen! In that case, we'd better get on with your foraging lesson. Alright everybody let's go ahead and get ready for our warm up. Keep those lungs open, breathe in constantly, make sure you never hold your breath. Don't hold it. Just try not to move your lungs as you breath. Keep it constant. - One, two, three and... - Ah, it's the cat. - To the roof. - Oh, here we go again. Yeah, he is not gonna make it. No, he's not. Do you think he is gonna make it? - Well he might. - Yeah, maybe. Get that filthy thing out of this house! Yeah, can we have it, Mum. We could keep it in our parrot cage. No. How did I do on time? - Oh pretty good. - That was fast. - Yeah, you were fast, yeah. - Oh, pretty fast. - I think fastest yet. - Yeah I think. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. A pond, stir the water with your beak and wait for the bugs to move. I'm Ploveria, who are you? I'm Ploey. What a sweet name. Uh, how can you breathe in the water? I'm here, silly! I knew that, hi. Hi. I think Ploey just got stung. And not by that bee. Whoa, whoosh. I'm going to be the fastest plover ever. Oh, yeah, well I'm going to be leader. Never! Then catch me if you can! I'd better go. It's my time on the night watch. You be careful, dear. Psst. Who's there? A friend. Friend, you're Shadow's decoy! What are you doing here? I'm here to warn you all of you! I'm warning you. I'll call the Sterna. Tell them you've been after their eggs again. I've gone vegan, you know, mushrooms, seeds, That kind of thing. Unless you've got an egg going spare? No, no no, of course you don't dude, I knew that. Let's hear this warning. Shadow's planning an attack, man. - When? - Very soon. So you've turned against Shadow, huh? I've had enough. I'm going in hiding in Paradise Valley. You know, the only place where I'll be safe. Valley of the cowards. Sure, but I'd rather be a living coward than a dead hero, man. - Papa? - Ploey! What are you doing here? I woke up and you weren't there. Your son, how cute. - Hi, kid. - You better go. And Skua, thank you. Hm? All right, let's get back before your mother wakes up. - Papa. - Hm? What's a coward? Well, there are two kinds of birds, son. Those who fly south in autumn, like us. And those who don't have the guts for that. They survive winter in a hidden valley somewhere in the mountains. They are cowards. But Plovers are brave, right, Dad? Yes, we certainly are. Whoosh whoa. - Catch me if you can. - Okay, whee. - Whoa, who. - Whee. Hurry, you two! You mustn't be late for flying-school. When Shadow appears, I'll make him chase me down here. On my signal, you raise the net and wrap it tightly around him. And then we'll be rid of him for good. Off you go, good luck today. Hey Ploveria, hi whoever you are? I'm Ploey! He's my flying mate. - Good one. - Hm. Oh, oh, you're serious? Yes, I'm serious. This guy? Listen up, I'll keep this simple! You learn to fly or it's bye bye. Your wings know how! Your tail knows how! But you must let it happen. Let's begin. First group, mount The Rock of Flight! Let's move, let's move, let's move! It's fun, Ploey, it's great! Next Group, let's move! Come on Ploey. It's Shadow! Warn the others. Safeguard the chicks! And ready the net. Fear, now that's a song I like. Ploey. I'm flying, I'm really fly... No! Help! Help! Hm. Let go of my son, you monster! Papa! Ploey! Papa! No. Papa. He won't eat, won't talk. You must eat, Ploey, get your strength back, so we can fly south. You want to be the leader, remember? Just like your father. I don't think so. Come on, Ploey. Let's make your father proud. Catch me if you can. I don't feel like playing. How about flying? I don't think flying is a good idea. It will only put us in danger. But for us to survive we have to fly. I can't do it. You did it before Ploey. You can do it again. Ploey jump, fly! Fly, fly! No, Ploey! Ploey. No no, not my Ploey! To the roof! To the roof. Wow, that dumb cat really never learns. Oh no, No he doesn't. He doesn't learn. No he is very dumb. No, not again! - Oh. - Get him out! Oh, it's just a little chick! - Out! - Mum, can we keep him? - No. - Please, please, please, please. Absolutely not! End of discussion. Please. Oh, give it here. The weather forecast is not looking good. Fall has arrived, heavy winds ahead. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to fly south. Aren't you excited to fly south? Palm trees and pina colada. Why so gloomy? Mind your own business. It's time to face facts, he's gone. How dare you! I would have carried him on my back. - Sorry, I just, well... - Just leave me alone. Ploveria, Ploveria, I'm here! Don't leave me! Mum, Mum look it's me! Get away from me. Yes. I'm right here, don't go. Mama, Ploveria. Mama, Ploveria, don't leave me here! Mama I'm here, I am alive! Ploveria wait for me, wait! I will see you again Ploveria, I promise you. Hm. What now papa. No papa! Is that the cat hunter? - It is, well done. - Oh, dig in. Yeah, You look like you need it. You definitely need it. So when are you leaving? Leaving? You're a plover right? - He's a plover. - He is a plover. Yes, he is and plovers aren't tough enough to stick out the winter here. - No, no way! - Uh, uh. Well, this plover decided to hang on. For a change. And hey, it looks like the winter ain't so tough with all this food lying around. You see, this is the last of the easy pickings. Yeah, shop closes up for the winter. - It does, doesn't it. - It does, yeah. Yeah, from here on, it's like a trash bin here. - An apple core there. - Definitely. Surprising amount of nutrition in horse manure though. Oh I love horse manure. Yeah it tastes horrible, but it is like nutritious. Yeah it is like bad but good. There's this place, called Paradise Valley. You know where it is? Yeah, but it's a really long flight. - It's very long. - Isn't it long? - Well, it is not medium long. - It's a pretty long. - Very long. - Yeah. - It's way up the... - I'm going to walk. Walk, Walk to Paradise valley? - Oh, you can't walk. - No you can't walk. - No. - No. So, how do I get there? First you aim north for this mountain. Yeah it's a mountian and well from the top of the mountain you will see a hill. Yeah and you go straight on, then you turn north. It's north. Yeah, until you see big, big, big... Big, well, yeah it's pretty big. Yeah it's a glacier. Yeah it is a glacier and the you turn west, going on. Until you see this big, big. - Big. - Well it's big. - It's very big. - Pretty big. - It's enormous. - Yeah, it's a peak. - Huge. - Yeah, yeah. - It's a big peak. - Mm-hm. And behind it, that's where you will find Paradise... - Valley. - You can't miss it, no. And we never knew that plovers name. No we didn't. Didn't we? We did. - Yeah. - What was his name? His name was Ploey, yeah. And we never knew that plover's name was Ploey. - No we didn't. - No. Didn't we? Hm. Hm? Huh? Skua! Hey Skua? Skua? Well. Get off me! - Huh? - You wrecked my trap! Uh, I'm sorry. I wrecked your what? My falcon-trap! I wait all morning. He comes swooping and then along comes you. Let me go! Let me go! What are you anyway? A plover chick of all things. Why haven't you flown south? I got left behind. Hm, I wonder why. Well, on the plus side, kid. Huh? You've learned life's greatest lesson, nobody cares. You've got to make it entirely on your own. I was making it on my own just fine thank you! Oh, really? And where are you heading? Up here on the mountain. To Paradise Valley. That bunch of losers. You'll fit right in. Ah, you can't fly! That's why you were left behind, right? I can too fly. When I want to. Then good luck and have a nice life. Even though, there's no such thing as either. Huh? You tricksy flea-infested excuse for a bird! How dare you invade my privacy! I didn't know you were there! You're practically invisible! I thought you were a warm patch of snow! Ooh, a warm patch of snow, huh? That's called water. You plovies really don't know anything about winter, do you. But we plovers do know about manners. And I shall say good day. Before you go, you see this? It's called camouflage, yeah. You might want to get some. Shadow will see your messy feathers from miles away. Shadow will see him from miles away, hm. Hm, hm. Hey, listen, kid if you'll do me a small favor, I'll guide you safely to Paradise Valley. How's that sound? What kind of small favor? I'll tell you when we are on top of the mountain. Come on, let's get going before a blizzard sets in. Thank you, Mr. Ptarmigan. The name is Giron. Giron, sir. No, no, no, no, no, no, just Giron. That'll do. I'm Ploey. Ploey the plover, how original. No, it's a very common name. You don't say. Huh? Wow. The fox, we'd better stay clear of him. Be extra careful where you leave your droppings, all right? I'm always careful. My Papa taught me to always... Sh. ♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪ Ah, ah, ah Wow. Ah, you like these? They're from a bang-bang. A human did it to me. With his bang bang stick. - But I got away. - Whoa. Left him hungry! And made a right fool out of him too. Look! Wow. What a pretty sea shell! It's my back up, the only friend I've got in this miserable world. Huh? Your only friend is a sea shell? You wouldn't understand. Here's what I wanted to show you! The clap trap! And once Shadow is in the clap trap, I use the bangy things! All I need is a decoy. Hm, a what? You know, something that Shadow wants badly. - Oh. - Or someone? No, no, no! I won't be your decoy, whoa! It's simple! No! Soon as he's in the trap, you just run away. No! But we made a deal. That I would be eaten by Shadow? I don't think so. Yes we did! No, we didn't! Fine! If you want to trudge on alone to your Loser Valley, you do that. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. - Fine. Huh? Hey Giron! I'm freezing! I'm just gonna run around. Giron! Sleep tight grumpy. And once Shadow is in the clap trap. Ka-bang! - Help! - Huh? - Help me! - Huh? Hello I'm over here, help me. Hola, amigo. I appear to have got myself in something of a pickle. Don't suppose you could pass me that branch? Of course, sir. I'm pretty sure the ice is safe. Whoa, whoa. You're doing great, buddy. Here you go. Thank you so much, amigo. Mucho gracias! I won't forget you. Me familia is in your debt. I must hurry now, gracias, adios, adios! Bye. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Oh no! He called for help. I couldn't refuse! Who called for help? Mousey. Rescuing a mouse? Ridiculous! And where was that mouse when you went in the water, huh? He took to his heels, didn't he? Surprise, surprise! He said he's in my debt. That means... It means you're a sucker! I told you before, nobody cares. You're on your own out here. Never forget it. Okay, I understand. You ruined my trap, you break your promise to help me and now you're trying to make me feel sorry for you! Oh boy. And remember winter rule number one! Keep your feathers dry. There, try to keep warm. Thank you, Giron. Yeah, yeah, don't mention it. We'd better find a shelter for the night. And something to eat, oh. They're good for you. Oh, my little boys hated them too, at first. But, oh, never mind. Your boys? Where are they? I left the nest to gather bitter buds. I spotted Shadow approaching. I took to the air and I attacked him, but he knocked me out cold. By the time I got back to the nest, it was all over. You see, I was supposed to be the decoy and save my family, well. Somehow it didn't turn out that way. But one day, one day, I will get my revenge! Shadow got my papa too. You asked where they are, my darling Dove and my little boys. They are right up there. They're beautiful. Because of them I never fly alone. Everyone you've loved, who are gone, they're up there, watching you. Is my papa there? Oh, yes he is. He is any one of them, all of them, watching over you, Ploey. There is one I want to see, and she's alive, I hope. She? Ploveria, I must survive, Giron. I must see her again. That's the spirit. And tomorrow we'll be in Paradise Valley.

Me familia wants to thank you for saving my life. Hello Ploey. Mousy, the fox! A fox, you say? Who's ready to have some fun, hey guys? Fun? Hello, welcome. Now I am going to show you the trick of preparing a ptarmigan. It's a vary gamey bird, so you mustn't overdo the seasoning and yet the seasoning is very key. What I going to be using is a little bit of arctic kelp and little bit of arctic thyme. And what we're going to do is roughly crush that up and we're going to massage it into the bird like so. Now mm, smell those smells. Now, ideally what I'd like to do is burry it in the arctic tundra for a couple of hours just so the meat begins the rotting phase as a... Talk about spicing things up a notch! I've prepared a simple meal. But certainly sufficient for two. Hey, foxy, whoa, hey, huh? Giron, it's me, let's go, come on. You gotta help me, help you. It's over. Stop this nonsense! Move your tremendous ptarmigan behind, you flea infested excuse for a bird! A ptarmigan feast for the main course, and a juicy mouse for dessert. oh, look out! Don't worry, we'll keep him busy. Best of luck to you and your friend. I won't forget you, bye, bye. Ah, I need a rest. Here you lost this. You were right! It works like magic. As soon as I blew it, the mice appeared. Saved by mice, how humiliating. You keep it, you keep it, you continue without me. No, I'm not leaving without you. I'll find some buds, and you'll feel better. All right, all right then, I'll just sleep a little. Now, be careful, I'll just. Giron! Giron! I'll find you after the blizzard, Giron. Until then. And any news of Paradise Valley? None. What, how useless are you? But I have been searching for years. Get out there and hunt, this second! I'm too hungry and cold. And tired and sad and lonely. If you had only caught enough plovers last autumn, we'd be fine! Spring will come, darling. And with it, the flock of fat and juicy plovers. And then there will be no more love songs. - We're not alone! - We're not alone! You, I remember you. The skinny little plover who got away, once. A tiny little taste of spring to ease my hunger until your family and friends arrive from the south and end in my mouth. If you eat me you'll eat a happy plover, but your misery will go on forever. How dare you! You monster. Let him go. Just do it! I, I can't. Go on, do it! Oh, Giron. You're hurt. I guess I can blame myself for that, sticking my neck out. Ah, there's my Dove and my boys. They'll show you the way to Paradise Valley. Giron? Giron? Good bye, my friend. What, where? Oh, I'll just have to rest a little. Darling, what's a matter. I'm sad, I can't help it. I know Ploey broke your heart but now he's gone. No I'm alive, I'm here. I wanted to give you time to mourn. I've been holding back my feelings. But my heart, my heart is bursting with love for you. She's mine, leave her alone. Oh Sloey, you're so strong. - No. - You've been my rock. I love you, I love you. I'm still alive and she's mine. So there it is, Paradise Valley.

First I heard Giron's conch. And I thought aha. Aha But all I found was this plover. And I thought aha. Uh huh? - And then I thought. - Uh huh? Aha! And aha, we have to do something man. He looks quite dead. Let's give him a hot bath. I can't take this. Perhaps a mushroom would do the trick? - Away with your poison. - Mm-hmm. I learned resuscitation in the Resistance. One, two, three, one, two, three. Well, best get him buried. ♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪ Oh, oh, oh Ploey. Mousey? Welcome to Paradise Valley. - Welcome. - Welcome. - to Paradise Valley. - No way! We weren't gonna bury you for real you know, man. We were making a King's Chair, man! Let's get the pot on the fire. I can't take it. I am too happy. What happened to Giron.

What do you mean spring? Tomorrow morning the sun will rise right above this here mountaintop and signal the arrival of spring! But then they're all coming back! Shadow's gonna attack my family, my friends. He does that every spring, little Ploey. Nobody can stop him. But, Ploveria! They must take care of themselves, man. You should be happy that you're alive, that you have arrived here, where you'll be perfectly safe in the best company ever! Huh? C'mon, it's party time. Ah, I don't really feel like it. You're missing a bird, aren't you? She thinks I am dead, and she's chosen someone else. If my wings weren't useless I'd lure him away from her. Shadow would catch you in no time. What would you have gained then? I would have saved her life. Now that's true love talking. True love is the only thing that can make you fly, or so I've heard. Choice is yours, Ploey. Stay here and be safe or put that love to work. Hm. Hey, where's our friend? Look, What he do? He's gone mad! What did you say to him, dude! It's not what I said. It's what he heard that matters. Look at that! Who's coming with me to save Ploveria and beat Shadow, once and for all. Deer, Swan, Mousey? Look at the bright side my friend. You're safe here. And this is a perfect place for cowards like us, right? Rather a living coward then a dead hero. My point exactly, man. Fine. First we use the clap trap, then the bangy thing. Come back here you flee infested... Giron. Ploey, you're flying. I'll be your decoy. Yeah, that's the spirit! We should fly side by side Ploveria. Get back in line Sloey. - It's more... - That's an order. Romantic. At last the love birds. Oh no, no no no no. Sloey stay in line. Spread out, spread out. It's my Ploey! It's my Ploey!

Whoa, ow, ow, ow, ow. Bring him here. He needs help. Catch me if you can! Wahoo, well done little one, all right. Woo,. So you survived winter? Uh huh. How was it? Cold, and the south? Warm. My Ploey! I'm so proud of you and I know your father would be bursting with pride too. Where are you going? Back to where I belong. Can I come along? No. Now go and get your girl before it's too late. I guess you found someone else, since you thought I was dead, I mean. I completely understand. Anyway, I just wanted to say hi, I'm glad that you came back and I wish you all the best. Ploey, don't make me fly alone. So you finally learnt to fly, yeah. Mm-hmm. Then catch me if you can. That's my boy.
