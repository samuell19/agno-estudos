Hurry up. Take it. Hold my hand. Jump! Let's go. OPERATION ARSENAL SCREENPLAY STARRING DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY WEEKLY CHRONICLE OF THE GENERAL-GOUVERNEMENT The Eastern Front. As it was planned by the High Command of the Army the offensive of the Soviet forces was finally stopped. Down the sandy roads the tracked army vehicles are approaching. Leon Degrelle, the commander of the Walloon Brigade along with the SS General Steiner, joined at the first front line. The warplanes are starting with the plan od destruction of land aims. Marching soldiers and the Soviet positions are attacked and destroyed. At one point of the front line, a German armored brigade stopped the enemy attack. German grenadiers were resting after the fight. An oath ceremony at the Wawel Castle. General governor Dr. Frank accepted the oath of the troops leaving for the front. Over there! Stop! Only here you'll get to look glamorous again. Get here a perm for the whole occupation term. Only here you'll get to look glamorous again. Buy here dolls for your wives and daughters. Almost for free, choose, what you want. Good morning to you. So, have you gathered enough money? 2000. The deal was 3000. You're dreaming. 3000 in these times? Not a dreamer, not a poet, I can only drop 100. 2200. There's no another one like that. This one or no another. -2300. - Spring is coming, 2800. Fall will pass, spring will come, we'll be goners by that time. You're the poet here. - Please, don't ruin my life. - He's in love. - 2400. -lwon't hear of it. 2600 is my last word. -You can see, we don't have more. - It's not me, who started the war. - How much is this jacket for? -3000. - I'll give you 2500. - It's sold. - Hold on! -Just a moment. - What's that, gentlemen? -We need 200. I'll be back in a moment. Ladies and gentlemen, here's the opportunity you get! Watches, gold, dollars. Buying, selling. Selling, buying. Watches, gold, dollars... What would you like, sir? A watch? A Pelican pen. A Pelican pen. - How much? - Five hundred. - Have you got lighters? - I'm trading in other stuff now. - What a big-head. - Pens are not selling now. - And it's not safe to write. -Try it. - Poor. - I wrote with it the best school-leaving exam in the Batory high school. In this case, I'll give you 150. Maybe you'll buy a scarf, too? It's almost new. 200 altogether, all right? All right. Only here you'll get glamorous again! Where's the old time roughneck? A prince! Stop! Stop, you Jewish pig! Hold it. - Leave him alone! - Alek! You acted like a snotty-nosed brat without imagination. - Could you look at this? - I see it every day. But we must be tough, otherwise they'll finish all of us off. I understand Alek's behavior. I do, too. But I won't allow for such spontaneity in my troop. And to prove that, you climbed the roof of Zacheta building. The operation was planned and I risked only my own life. Oh, Rudy. You'll choose a punishment for yourself. Stop! - Bye. - Bye. Hey, Rudy! My jacket! I almost forgot, Prince. Have you seen that blow? Yes, I have. And now split from here, you damned athlete. I count to three. One, two... three! Baska! Bye! Finally, you thought about me. A new jacket? It's great. Who are you dressing for, so elegantly? There is one girl. - Come, mum's cooked great lunch. -No, I can't. Why? One day I'll explain it to you, but can't. It's my punishment. What are you talking about? - So why did you come here? -To give you ride back home. And to tell you, that I'm still thinking about you. Thinking about me is not enough. TO NICHOLAUS COPERNICUS HIS COMPATRIOTS What a location. - It's very well guarded. - It's even safer with them. - What's your nickname? - Copernicus. It was you. - Take one. - Scouts don't smoke. Soldiers smoke, sometimes even drink. What kind of soldiers are we? Rather cartoonists. You don't know, how to draw it. Leave me alone. So there was this German guy, and he put a key at his back. - And he put his hands up. - Sure. - And he drew his gun out of his holster. -Who, Ziutek? You're kidding. All right, let's go back to our locomotives. Let's take seats. Rudy, come to the blackboard. The best place for the attack is this turn. The train must slow down here. We'll put three explosives here. At even distances. It's impossible, that all of them would fail. And the additional security? Additionally, we'll have atime fuse, attached to the sleeper, or the kilometer pole. STEN submachine gun, the construction of which you're about to see, is designated for the fight at small distances. It's the equipment of the intelligence and storm troops. That's an offensive grenade. "Phillipine" type. When you arm it and pull out the safety-pin, it explodes at the moment, when it hits the object. The explosion force is great, the striking power is small. Danusia, are you here? - Czesiek! - Heniek! My God! Where have you been? - Far away. - Danusia left you here alone? - She went to get some food for supper. - Sit down. Would you like some tea? I'll put the kettle on. She's nice, your wife. You made a good match. You know... I don't complain. At least, so far. But why are you standing? We'll light this damned stove. Don't stand like that. Tell me, what's up with you. - With us? - Yes. - Forests. - Forests. Are you hunting for a big game? Why not? You think I'm painting pigs on the walls? Have you ever seen something like this? Only in the movies. And you carry it around? Should I have left it under my pillow? We keep our guns in the storage. You must be waiting for the uprising. Have you seen something like this? Do you know, how to blow up trains? To make up for all we loose today... Thirty one... one has to live to be 140 years old. Thirty two. Longevity. That's what I'm up for now. Thirty three. Thirty four. - And I know, what it consists in. - Interesting. Forty five. One just has to want it. Get it? Amazingly simple. Did you come up with it yourself? Thirty eight. Yes, I did. You always wanted to have more than you can. Perhaps not 140, but I won't live shorter than to be 90. Old geezer. You're wasting so much energy. You could grate potatoes for me. I told you to stay away, when I have visitors. - Rudy is fighting with me. -Foryou I'm Janek and not Rudy. Stop it, kids. Duska, get down to work. Oh, Janek. How can you live here to be 140? Leave Duska alone. Why don't you stay here for the night? We'll find a place for you. - I can't. They're waiting for me. - Again we won't see each other long. - Maybe never. - Don't say that. I'm very glad that Heniek has such a nice wife. - But what do you see in him? - It's curfew in 20 minutes. - Go, or you'll be caught. - Tougher guys tried to bust me. - Don't be such a daredevil. - Bye. This Czesiek is boasting too much. Now each of you is playing a cowboy. - Don't you want to listen to the news? - Is the electricity back on? I'll turn on the radio. - Here's the news from the Italian front. -What a mess is here. American bombers bombed the enemy territory inflicting serious losses on the enemy army and its equipment. South of the Lake Ladoga, the Soviet Army attacked the enemy forces in result of which it took few hundreds of prisoners. Local fights at the Southern parts of the front, especially at the Upper Don River were successful. All the signs show, that the last German offensive is a desperate attempt to regain the territories they lost in the battle of Stalingrad. Amen. All right. It's time to go to bed. - I'll go to the countryside tomorrow. - Will you bring bloodwurst? I'll try. - Don't quarrel. God night, boys. - Good night. It looks like something has started. Rudy? - Do you know, what I'm scared of most? -What? I wouldn't like to die there. They'll be hanged. Like haunted animals. I want to die in fight, armed. Like a human being, with dignity. So I have to learn to shoot well. What difference does it make how you die? You'd like to give some meaning to your death. A new Messiah of the Polish underground movement. - You're vain. - I just want my death to make sense. You think that your extraordinary death will move someone. It'll set an example for future generations. Another Prince Poniatowski. Who will care, how we died? It's a mass and anonymous death all around here. And you'd like to be singled out, wouldn't you? Who are you, actually? A monument, a temple, God's appointed? And why not just a brick? A regular brick in this new Pantheon? "If there's a need they go to death, one by one, like stones cast by God to the entrenchment. Exactly like this. Zoska, come on. Don't be angry. I'm just talking to myself. Zoska! - Remember Zeus? - Sure. It's sweet and great honor to die for... ..your homeland. -Those were great times. - Yes. Goodnight. Goodnight. It may be Czesiek. Must have missed his train. -Who's that? -The janitor. Hands up! Check the wardrobe. We're sorry. It won't take long. It's a very practical stool. I'm ready. Let the boys sleep a little longer. Wake Duska up, she has to leave before 1 pm No, Gapa, you stay here. Take care of yourself. Yes? He's still asleep. All right, I'll call him. It's for you. Yes? Hi. Heniek got ill badly last night. - Is there a doctor? - We called for him. Come here as soon as you can. So a day has started. - What's happened? - Nothing good for sure. Why isn't he singing? It doesn't sing, when strangers are around. - Good morning. - Good morning. Come in, please. Last night Heniek and his wife were arrested by the Gestapo. The arms storage must be emptied right away. He won't say anything. I don't know. But I know, we shouldn't be reckless. He's one of us. I trust him as much as you do. But I know the Gestapo, too. It must have been some coincidence. Does he know your addresses? Clear the locations right away. Even if he knew it I wouldn't leave my house. It's the matter of trust and belief. Without it, everything would be pointless. What's this? - Notes from a trip. - No kidding. Get up. We know, that you blow up trains. Don't you see, we're working? - I've brought Sturmscharfiihrer's order. - Come in here. Here you are. Here's the bill. It's an expensive chocolate. The price also includes delivery. Germany will not forget it. Thank you. - Do you remember me, sad face? - Yes, Mr. Oberscharfuihrer. Don't forget the chocolate. It doesn't always depend on me. We need sweets here. Good bye. Who's your commander? - Kotwicki. - Where does he live? I don't know. You'll tell us everything, baby. -We won't let you out alive. - Schultz. Who "Rudy" is? Kurtz! Your stubborness is good for nothing. We'll decipher this address. Rudy, Rudy... Redhead. -Add a STEN to it. - It won't fit, don't you see? It's a patent. We need to keep order. - I'm late. - Get down to work. Finally. So here is one piece for everyone and get to work. You shoot only at my order. All right. Getin. - Good afternoon. - Hello. - Are selling brooms? - That's right. You won't get much by that. You forgot something, boys. - Let me take it. - Here. Have you seen that SS-man? He seemed like willing to bust us. But he hold his horses on time. The clock of independence. Turn it off. We can't stand in attention. These apples wouldn't suit him well. Right, Rudy? Is that all? -There're only apples left. - So give me your pieces. You feel like shooting, don't you? Perhaps we'll need to shoot soon. You'll have a chance to shoot, don't worry. Alek. I'm next in line for your jacket. All right? You could wrap in it like in blanket. Let me try it on. - I'll see. - Next time, Okay? What's this face about? Are you plotting something against me again? Oh, Baska. All those secrets all the time. Always hiding something, disappearing. Alek, I don't want it this way. I understand. You don't want the Germans, round-up, executions. Don't make a fool out of me. I know everything about you. And I want to do it along with you. But it's nothing to do for the girls. Writing on the walls and tearing down the flags. Baska. There'll be time for everything. Again, the same. Alek, please, do understand. I want to be with you. To get bored with you. -To quarrel with you. - This happens more and more often. I'm scared. Why, Basia? Znaniecki. I thought it's a cook book. "The Civilization of the Future". "Civilization of the wise and the good". I see, that you've read it. Imagine, that we've read some things. Most obviously it was something, you shouldn't have read. Perhaps you're right. We haven't read this one important book. I wonder, what it was. If only I knew it. Words, words, words, words... which can't protect you from anything and can't change anything. But... we have nothing else, just them. We also have guns. Guns and hatred. But they have more guns and more hatred. It's not like that, dad. Our hatred is clear. We can't let them tread on us. Only then we can preserve our humanity. Don't you understand... that most of all I want to save you. I want you to survive. Would you like to save a coward? I want to live but not against all odds. We must save something more in this flood, not only our heads. Who is to save this something if all of you die? There are many of us. What about Heniek? I'm waiting for the news from Pawiak. Isn't there any way to get him out of there? No, there isn't. Helplessness is the worst thing. Janek! Janeczek! Just a moment! The Redhead is not really a redhead. "Rudy" you're not really a redhead. What are you talking about? You'll understand everything soon, Rudy. Documents. Name. Jan. - Family name. - Bytnar. Rudy's been arrested. And my father, too. The neighbors warned me. Duska, baby. Hanka, take care of her. All right. Come with me. We've been hit. Straight in the heart. Rudy is ill. Inform the whole family. Cielak. Alarm for all the attack groups. Meeting at Slon's. - What's happened? -ldon't know. Rudy's been arrested. Meeting at Slon's. When did it happen? Good morning. Rudy's been arrested. But there's a chance to take him over. You need to get in touch with the top. I'll try. Here you are. It's wonderful. He'll be taken to Szucha Ave. any moment. Just tell me, why in this particular case... So many valuable, irreplaceable people got in their hands. And? No one ever tried to rescue them. - But we'll rescue Rudy. - Let's say, the operation will succeed. But... are you able to foresee, what repressions it will bring? Is your friend's life worth so much? I don't know how much his life is worth. Or the life of anyone of us. But we won't leave Rudy in this situation. -You don't know, what he means to us. - 1 know perfectly well. No, you don't. This operation has its sense and a chance for success. This operation has its sense and a chance for success. Firstly, only in this way we can stop the chain of arrests. Secondly, we'll rescue not only him but the whole transport. And the repressions? Was there at least one day without round-ups, executions and arrests? A successful operation against the Gestapo in the middle of the city would raise people's spirits. We should risk it. Rudy's been tortured for 14 hours now. And we're losing time for discussions. -We must decide. -l can't do it, without the Manager. When is he coming back? He may come back even today. I announced the alarm. The boys are waiting. Should I cancel the alarm, because of somebody's absence? - Who'll be the commander? - Orsza. - That's what we've decided. - It'll be better this way. All right. I'll do everything to get in touch with him. It's 1 p.m. I should have the decision before 4 pm Anyway, we're carrying on with the preparations. Yes. We've got just few guns. Ammunition is also scarce. We're no great shooters. But we'll rescue Rudy. A little bug came out to the sun. It's the spring, Rudy. Now you'll be a good boy, won't you? Kurtz? You're still saying these things were not in your cellar? Did I put them in there? So you're not the commander of Grey Ranks and the leader of sabotage activity? You were the one, who gave orders to Heniek. I don't know any Heniek. Kurtz! Do you know him? And you? Rudy, plead guilty or they'll kill you. See? He recognized you and you don't know him? Don't beat him, he'll admit to everything. See? He gave you away. He said, that you're the boss. What will you say to that? That's not true. I'm a regular private soldier. What were your duties? Small sabotage actions. Tearing down the flags and painting the symbols. Yes, indeed. And who was your commander? - Kotwicki. - And his address? I don't know. He always came to me. You're stubborn. Kurtz! Take care of him! - Good afternoon. - Please, comein. Oh, it's not so bad. 250,20. In this country at least the chocolate is good. Good bye. Good bye. The crossing of Bilanska, Dluga and Nalewki, next to Arsenal. That's the best place for the operation. That's the best place for the operation. Me and Orsza have checked the whole route. From Szucha Ave. to the Ghetto. Here, on this curve, the car has to slow down. That's all for the location. Now, the time. The Germans are torturing in the office hours, from 8 a.m. till 4 p.m. Then the prisoners are transported to the Pawiak prison. Only in exceptional situations a prisoner is left for the night. We'll be informed if Rudy is transported in this convoy. The troops are gathering at 3:45 p.m. The operation starts at 4:30 p.m.. At 5:00 p.m. it should be over. Check your time. What time is it on your great Omega? 1:50 p.m. Good afternoon. Sit down. - What's the news? - I've got no answer. Please, continue. Now, the plan. The most important task is to stop the truck. The group "Attack" commanded by me will take care of that. - Anoda. -Yes? You command the "Bottles" section. One plus two. Armed with the bottles with gasoline and the pistols. At my signal, you'll cast the bottles at the cab. If the truck doesn't stop, you shoot at the Germans at the back. That's clear. - Maciek? -Yes? You command the section "STEN 1" You have two people and one machine gun at your disposal. Three people and one machine gun. If one dies, another one takes over. You know, we have only 2 STENSs. And now, listen. You're the next barrier. If the truck attacked with the bottles won't stop, you shoot at the cab at the angle of 90 grades. That's important. This way, you won't shoot one of the prisoners. - Understood? - Yes, sir. Slon! You command STEN 2 section. Also one plus two. You're the third barrier on the way of the convoy. If it's not stopped earlier, you attack it straight from the front. I hope, the prisoners after the first shots, will fall on the ground. If the truck manages somehow to pass these barriers, the last one will be the grenade section. - Commanded by Alek. - It won't get so far. - There are no miracles. - 1 said "justin case". Then you'll throw the grenades at the cab. Besides, you're the security from the ghetto side. That's all for the attack. Orsza, please, continue. I'm standing here. Signalization section: Kuba and Kadlubek. When you notice a truck, you'll give us a signal taking off your cap. Yes. And your place is here. But you need to see Kadlubek. He'll be by the bank. When you make sure, it's the right truck, you also take off your cap. - And this will be a signal for me. - Yes, I understand. When I whistle, Zoska starts the action. And just in case, I'll remind you the type and number of the truck. Renault, POL 72076. During the operation, you'll secure the rear from the Teatralny Square. And Giewont is responsible for the whole of security. When I whistle 3 times, the operation is over. The retreat is down Dluga St., towards The Old Town. Evacuation of Rudy, by a hackney cab organized by Gruby. A hackney cab? Jeremi was to buy some old junk. He didn't manage to. That's all. Thank you. Don't worry. You did more than you could. I wouldn't say so. Who's this? Tell me, who?! - My friend, Entrenchment. - What's his address? In September 1939 he left with his parents for Romania. Shit-head! And who recruited you to this underground movement? A friend from school. Jacek Tabecki. Well, finally. Where does he live? The urn with his ashes was buried at the Powazki cemetery. The plot 182. Kurtz! That's enough for today. It's almost four. See you tomorrow, Rudy. Try to remember the friends, who're alive. - Schultz. - Oh, yes. Thank you. And we still don't have the permission. Everything all right? I'm really sorry. - What are you doing? - It's a very important matter. What a jerk! Mr. Cyprian? I've just sent the merchandise. It'll be there soon. - Excuse me, what time is it? - 4:30. He's in the convoy. Thank you. And Mietek's not here. He didn't have enough time. So? Unfortunately, I didn't get in touch with him. - What do you decide? - 1 have no right to decide. The Manager should be back tomorrow. Cancel the operation. Wait. Tell the boys that Rudy is not in the convoy. Janek. -Janeczek. - Room 228. I recognize the hand of Schultz. Janeczek. This one. Hurry up. I'll come here later to check. Do you hear me? They've cleared the location. You can give the addresses. Do you have any poison here? Give them the addresses. Maybe they'll stop beating. You don't understand me. I want to take poison. - Until there's a chance... -There's no chance. They'll torture me to death. - Why don't you want to help me? - Do you want to smoke? Do you? Scouts don't smoke. The Manager comes tomorrow. And tomorrow we'll get the information from Pawiak. - If everything goes well... - Everything tomorrow. They don't put off anything. He's being tortured second day already. Zoska, you know it well. Yes, I do. See you tomorrow. It's the piston, ignition... and the compressor. - And most of all the battery. - Stop that already. You're an expert and I'm too. It's not new, but it's been checked. It has real papers. And that's worth more than the stupid ignition. So? Just as I said. - Well... - Mr. Kazimierz... we don't have more. Golden? Golden. - It's an Omega. - Omega. This junk is not that bad. I'll work on it. It'll work like a clockwork. Maybe it'll work out tomorrow. -Jeremi? -Yes? I'll get off here. See you! Excuse me, what time is it? I have no watch. But it's late. Go home. It's so wonderful here. A real Transatlantic. - Have you ever been to the seaside? - No. So, imagine. Imagine that... we're sailing away for a faraway trip. - Seagulls... -The wind... And the curfew. There's no curfew. Basia, we have to go. - But it's raining. - It almost stopped. -You want me to get wet? - But we have to go. Is it going to be like this for ever? - 1 know, it's something very important. - Basia... Don't you see, I feel so good with you? That I would like to be with you as long as I can? I've never told you that, but you must be feeling it. I love you. Deeply and truly. Just like everything I do and fight for. And I want you to remember that. Always. Hi. Listen, I took a ride with Jeremi. He's a great driver. - Jeremi? - Swear to God. Let me be the driver. "A Mercedes automobile crushed against the wall". I can prove my skills on the spiral ramp in Karowa St. - Come on. - Stop it. We're better because instead of a hackney cab we have a junk car. But we need to fight to free Rudy. - And we don't have many guns. - We've got a lot of arms. How's that? We just have to win it over from the Germans. We'll be disarming them and start tonight. Slon, Alek and me will be the first ones to go. Hands up! Shoot! Let's run! Alek! Hey, mister! Where to? Gentlemen. What are you doing? Quiet. It's a curfew soon. - It must have been someone important. - 1 guess so. - See you tomorrow, guys. - Bye. How are you feeling, Alek? No. I'll never like this job. I hope that you put him back in good shape. - Take him. - He must stay here. - Take him. - He must stay here. Your patient will come back here soon. Take him away. That's impossible. - Before the war it was a bugle call. - Whatever I have... Butter for the bread. Anyway, it's Friday today. - Did you put sugar? - Yes, Don't worry. Everybody's waiting. We'll be there in half an hour. If only they give us a sign. Vodka bottles. And gasoline. And what fearsome arms they make. It's the most eminent invention of the present war. And thanks to this invention... the scales will turn in our favor. Do you know, how it burns? Nothing will put this fire down. You try the water... and it goes... and burns even more. Anoda... What? Could you stop talking? Why? Just like this. Let's be silent for a while. How about that? As you want. Halo? Thank you. Rudy is at Szucha Avenue. All the sections ready at 4:00 p.m. How about the Manager? Florian has an appointment with him. What if he doesn't give us permission? We made a big mistake, Janek. We're having a hard time with you here, thinking we caught a big fish and it's just nothing. Zero. You're worse than those guys from the communist party. Just give us few addresses and we'll send you to the Sanatorium, where you'll quietly wait for the German victory. We had a strict secrecy. Anybody could be caught everyday. I didn't want to know any addresses. Oh, Rudy. Or you'll make us work after hours. Mr. Sturmscharfiihrer doesn't like it at all. You're wasting your time. Kurtz! - Here's Slon. - Finally. Hi, guys. - And? - We're packing. Katoda, give me a jacket. Stop fooling around! Don't you worry. Bolec! Remember, to throw a grenade and not the safety pin at the enemy. What's a safety pin? He should be here already. Maybe the train was late. It's hale and hearty. We'll rent it out for weddings and funerals. It's 4:15. And Orsza's not here. That's right. Are we waiting? Yes, we are. Go away, you've had enough. - May I use the phone? - Go ahead. Go away, Gienek. Cabbage stew, vodka and beer. What are these people? I'd like to speak to Mr. Cyprian. Not yet? What? The number? Hold on. What's the number here, boss? 82432. 82432. I'm waiting. A friend will call me here. It's very urgent. You understand: buying, selling. What have you got? 500 kg of flour. Luxury merchandise. Coarse-ground flour. Give me a break. What would you like? Lemonade. How about this beer, boss? My wife now is asking for more. Come on. Come in, please. You cannot see anything here. Me neither. It's the war. That's all for today, Schultz. It's almost 4:30. You'll continue with him tomorrow. Please, come in. I just need a little chocolate. Two or three tables. Mr. Sturmscharfiihrer is giving you one more night. We'll start working quite seriously since the morning. Either you'll say everything like at confession... or we'll trample you into the floor and carry out like garbage. Kurtz! Take him away! - Back to prison. - Take him. Yes, that's all. Could I make a phone-call from here? - You're welcome. -Thank you. Mr. Cyprian? I'm just taking the merchandise and going to you in 5 minutes. Yes. Thank you very much. Good bye. Justa moment. I'm waiting for an important phone-call. -What do I care? - Every minute is worth for me... - For me, too. Get real. - Please. - Just leave me alone. - Sir, please. Don't call now. All right. I can wait. Hello? Mr. Cyprian? Yes? Good. That's a deal. They'll be leaving any moment. We have only 15 minutes. We have no time to waste. What's the decision? Do it. What's up? Cancelled again? We'll go for it. Bolec. We'll go for it. Watch out for him. What's Kuba doing? He'll miss the convoy. Drop your gun! Slon! - Easy. - Damned lock. Ready. Follow me! Get off, you're free. Poles! - Where can we run? -To the Old Town. Zoska! What am I to do? Run to the Old Town. - Is it the uprising? - No! Scram now! Hurry! To the Old Town! - Over there! -I can't! I have to go back to Pawiak! - My daughter is tortured there! - Run away! Now! Run away! Jeremi! Rudy! Zoska! I didn't think you'd do it. Bolec! Bolec! Come on! Leave me here. - 1 have one more grenade. - Easy. Stop! Stop the car! Stop! Get off! Go to the gate! Anoda! Hurry! Stop! Anoda! - Armed? - Yes. Stop! Faster! Thank you. Do you know, what's happened? No, we don't know anything. Put this piece away. Two tickets, please. Soldiers don't pay. Sturmscharftihrer, we found her nearby. I think, she's crazy. I... They freed me by force. 1 didn't know anything about it. I didn't want it. I must go back to Pawiak. Of course, please, get in. Such a mess will never happen again. x. N4 x. N5 x. N6 Be calm. Everything will be all right. - But we rescued Rudy? - Yes. Lie down. Don't move. We need to operate on him right away. - They're waiting in the hospital. -Can't we doit here? - It's out of question. - Give me blanket. Buzdygan, you were very brave. You have to hold on a little longer. - I'll help you. - Stay with Rudy, okay? Carefully. What about Rudy? I'm a surgeon. We need to hold a case conference. Is there... any hope? There is hope... until he lives. Are you asleep? No, I'm not. All this seems like a dream to me. I feel so good here. So blissful. I was dreaming about it over there. To see all of you. To see you. You won't disappear, Zoska? Don't talk so much. - But I must. I want to. - Will you drink something? I'm afraid I won't have time to say everything. Long-lived people have time for everything. Sleep now. How's Alek? He was great. He was so much scared of shooting, remember? - 1 want him to take my place. -Stopit. Sleep. - Is it a severe wound? - It's a stomach wound. You think, he'll survive? He'll have an operation soon. Alek. Baska. Basia. Why didn't you say anything? I wanted to tell you. After it's over. The operating room is ready. Give my jacket to Rudy or to Zoska. Let all of them wear it. Why? SILENCE, OPERATION The place is secure, you can rest here. - I feel good with you. - What do they know about us? The one, who was interrogating me, Schultz... he was talking about the Grey Ranks as if he knew everything. About small and major sabotage. Blowing up the trains. Heniek told him? They have his notes. I saw him only once. He was beaten cruelly. You're interrogating me. It's ridiculous. - I'm not afraid of any interrogations. - We're not interrogating you. -l didn't inform on Rudy. -So who did it? I don't know. As I don't know, who framed me. - But you knew his address. -Idid. So what? I knew hundreds of others. His address was encrypted in my notes. Perhaps they deciphered it. I don't know. - 1 didn't betray. - Nobody blames you. It's just our duty. You would do the same if you were us. We need to know everything that the Gestapo knows about us. They know a lot. About the Grey Ranks, the Home Army. This Gestapo guy, Schultz, said they'll finish us within few weeks. He was boasting. I don't know. They knew everything about me. Even about the hiding place in the stool. You must disappear. You'll go to Lublin. What about Danka? My wife. She's been sent to Auschwitz. We need to take him away from here. I have a plan already. I'll take him away even tomorrow. You think tomorrow will be too early? There was nothing to operate on. Everything was torn apart. Everything. You were right, Zoska. It's important, how one dies. Thanks to you, I'm dying like a human being. You're starting it again. I was never so close to you as I was there. I knew... that if I last through this... it will be... not only my victory... but ours. It's really important, how one dies. Rudy, please, don't say so. One needs to want. I do. I love all of you so much. And I don't want to die. Everything hurts. - Zoska, save me! - Sister Tamara! Rudy, what's with you? Stop. He's saying something. lam... just a regular private soldier. Straight to the surgery, please. We have a place in a hospital. Tomorrow we'll call an ambulance. Doctor... These are all the tests results. We don't need them. You've brought here a dead body.
