THE LINE Given that you carried out a violent attack on Mrs Christina Celestini, who is your mother, and whose home you had lately been sharing. I have decided, on account of the seriousness of the facts and the real risk of recidivism, to impose exceptional provisions on you. These provisions will take the form of a restraining order under article 28 of the civil code. Firstly, as of today for a period of three months any contact whatsoever with your mother is strictly forbidden. Secondly, this order requires you, subject to the imposition of sanctions, not to go within 100 metres of your mother's home. Also for a period of three months. Have you anything to add? - How will I do my work? - What work? Little jobs for the neighbours. Some are within 100 metres. Declared work? - No. - Right, I didn't hear that. I warn you, if you do not respect this restraining order, you will go straight to prison. Understood? You'll be summoned in a few months. Your mother has filed a complaint. In any case this has to be pursued. 100 metres means 100 metres. Not 50 or 85. Is that clear? Hello. Are you Mrs Christina Celestini's partner? Yes, I am. Your stepdaughter has come for some things. - Now? Judicial order. I can't wait. Marion, put your shoes on, we're going outside. - What's going on? - It's your sister. Hurry up! I have to get dressed. It doesn't matter, there's no time, come on! Come on, Marion! It's meant to be just a few things. - Either the stool or the amp. Not both. - You can have this back. I've removed all the house keys. Try to keep your cool. Why do the cops always call me? I'm not family. I don't want to know. I won't ask, you don't ask me anything. Don't worry, I won't stay long. Good. The cops told me several weeks. What's with the broken stool? I'm going to repair it. Best you sleep in here, there's a sofa bed now. You left this. You have no new messages. Hello, this is Louise Celestini's voicemail. Please leave a message. Goodbye. This is Louise Celestini's voicemail. Please leave a message. Louise, I'm here. Canal side. I'd like to see you all before you go to church. Hey, Youri! Can you go tell Marion I'm here? Got that? Marion! Your sister's waiting by the canal. Her face is all smashed in. Like she's been beaten up. I'm not going to sing. - We're not going to church cos of you. - Why? Mum is still in hospital. They're keeping her in for observation. Why? Is it serious? I don't know. Ask Louise. Why did you do it? Mum was mocking you about this dress! Did you want me to let her? And then Serge... And it doesn't make you look fat. That was unkind of her. - What are you all going to do? - I don't know. - Is Louise there? - She got here this morning. Can you ask her to come. - What, here? - Yes. What do you want? I wanted to know how Mum is doing. Didn't you get my messages? I'm bound to be worried, aren't I? Bound to be? It's thanks to you she's in hospital. - Why, is it serious? - It's her head. That's all we know for now. Should have thought about that beforehand. What made you hit her? - Seems you hit her like crazy. - She first went for Marion, then she... You always have an excuse. You do nothing but hit people! Hit. That's all you can do. When will you stop hitting out all the time? Listen, we should be in church now, enjoying the little one sing. But instead, she's now crying in the corner. And that bloody Serge is waiting for the insurers. And you're loitering here in that state. You can be proud. You scare the children. Grandmother is in a state of shock. The family is leaving. And I'm having to deal with the caterer who wants paying for his fancy sandwiches, plus half his crockery is smashed to pieces! What do we do with you? We're keeping you at 100 metres now. And next fight, what do we do? Put you in a little cage on an island? Can you face the other way, please. I'm worried I'll faint. They're all looking at us. It's embarrassing. And here comes the stepfather. That's all we needed. Marion, go back inside. And take off that dress. Don't say anything. - You shouldn't be here. - She's allowed. She's 100m away. - Anyway she's just leaving. - I don't care. She laid a hand on her mother. Don't come back! - Don't you touch me. - I won't, but leave. Stop making a spectacle of yourself. We want to get through the day in peace. Serge, she has a right to be here! - Stop it! - Marion, get back inside! - You've torn her dress! - What an arsehole! Get out of here! You're all insane! I don't believe it! Margaret, open up. Open the door, please. Why bother stitching you back together? It hasn't even had time to heal over. Look at yourself. Look at yourself. Look at yourself. Like what you see? When you end up looking like shit, what then? Come back like this again and you don't come in. What are you doing here? - What? - What are you doing here? Working, you know. You OK, Marion? But it's too near us. You can't. So what am I supposed to do? I don't know, but you're not allowed. - I'm going to miss my bus. - Wait there. - When is Mum back from hospital? - This evening! Have you seen your sister's face? How can anyone be so ugly? Go away, we don't want you here! Are you managing OK with the cages? Yeah, yeah. It sticks to everything, this muck. We'll make a good coffee. We've earned it! You really took a battering. I hope you let them have it too. Stop the car! What is she doing here? Stop honking the horn! - Mum, are you OK? - Move! I just want to talk to her. Can someone open a window? - Mum, do you want to talk to her? - No. Don't open it! Close the window! She's trying to say something! Stop! Stop it, we'll fall into the canal! You're going to hurt her! - Mum! - She is crazy! Answer me! She's mad. Take that. You'll hurt her! Off the car! Open it! Mum, open it! What are you doing? - Fists. - I'm tired. I set conditions. You have to respect them. - I haven't fought. - Your arms. - You know these old marks. - Fine. - Look... - It's OK. You haven't even looked. Go on, look. A little bit louder. Wait, I'll... I'll take off the dressing. Oh, goodness! It's like a ringing in my ear. Like a note. Like a B. A very high B flat. Go on, play a single note. Louder. No. Play several notes in succession, very loudly. I can't hear anything. If I cover my good ear, I hear nothing at all. She has made me deaf. Do you realise? - Maybe it will come back, Mum. - No! It won't come back. They said so at the hospital. Your sister has destroyed something in my ear. I was a soloist. My career was starting to blossom. She came on the scene and I took up teaching. Now she's even robbing me of music. Wait, that... That hurts, Marion. Come here, Marion. Sit next to your dear mother who is half deaf. Pass me a cushion. - Poor Mum. - What? I said, "poor Mum". Yes, exactly, poor Mum who's had no luck with her daughters. Margaret had everything. She's a musician, she inherited that from me. And what did she do with it? Nothing! I don't mind with Louise. She's no artist. She has no musical fibre. She's made for a normal life. She'll be a good mother and... that will be enough for her. It's not the same with you. I had you late in life. You weren't on the cards. The doctor said that, given my age, you are one of life's little miracles. We didn't celebrate your St Cecilia's day, but we'll celebrate your Communion. You'll be able to sing at that. My life's little miracle. Are you back again? I can't stay long. - How is Mum? - She's OK. Has she recovered? - Has she recovered? - Yes. She just has to rest now. Hang on, I'll help you. Show me. You've cut yourself. Did Serge drink all this? Serge has left. What? Did Mum throw him out? No, she says he left because of you. What's wrong with you? Are you working on your singing? You must. Mum says it tires her at the moment. You must practise daily, not to lose your touch. If you don't sing, you'll lose your lovely voice. I'm going back in now. I can give you your lessons, if you like. Hang on, Marion. Here. Can you take this back? What shall I say to Mum? Nothing. She'll see it tomorrow. She'll be pleased. You think so? What are you doing, Marion? Not at school? It's 100 metres from here to the house. You're within the zone. Step out. You're joking! Get out of the zone. I'm sorry. Go on, move! Get out of it! But it's ridiculous. I'm working right there. Hey, careful! What's at the other end? - Did you fix it to the house? - No, it's Mum. What? Mum's at the other end? Stop it! You'll pull her over. Mum's at the other... Stop it! Now get out! Swear you'll never cross this line. Swear! Hand on heart and before God. Before God? Are you mad? Please. - That's stupid. I'm going to get my... - No. No! You're not allowed to! No, you're not allowed. You're not allowed. Hey, look who's here! Got any work for me, Eddie? I've calmed down. Yes, it shows. Maybe calm down a bit more yet... Yeah, yeah. So you check everything. Check the lifts are working, the state of the bins, and that the fire extinguishers are there. Make sure the doors are shut and there are no ventilation issues. And pick up anything that shouldn't be here, OK? Don't worry, you'll memorise the route. Those are the recycling bins. Put them out when they're full. Let me introduce you to Oscar. Oscar, this is Margaret. So, this is where you'll spend most of the day. Or night. Decide between yourselves. You have 4 screens and 6 cameras for each floor. That way you can survey everything. - Hey. - Hey. - Where are we going? - Somewhere here. You OK with that? Not too heavy? We can go here. Where? Near the mound. What here?! Yeah. It's not too far for you. It's more practical. Where did you get to with Mum? This Is The Way for Saint Cecilia, but I'd rather do number 15. - What's 15 again? - Day Of Joy, page 38. You know Day of Joy by heart. That's not it, it's Divine Light. Oh, sorry. I'll start again. Three, four... Day of joy, day of victory He reaches out His hand to me Draws me from deep waters He takes hold of me and delivers me - Do you believe what you're singing? - What? "He reaches out His hand to me Draws me from deep waters" "Takes hold of me and delivers me" Do you really believe that? Yes, I do. I think it's beautiful. It helps me. Can you adjust the spotlights please? And sharpen the focus a bit more. For the concert, it's just her, not both of you? Yes, just her, guitar and vocals. - Not touring together anymore? - No. Pity. It was good. Such is life. That's good. He's offering you a concert. A weekend after Christmas. Does that suit? The night... The night that... And my body that... I fear... I have no fear of... Of losing myself or of losing... At night in my dead-ends that seem... Why don't you want to do this gig together? - We decided to no longer work together. - Why? - You know very well why. - I don't. Tell me. Come on, I'm working. You've got someone else? Is that it? She can come here, I don't mind. I'm talking about a gig, nothing else. Enough! I have to work. Go away, thanks. You want to know why? That's why! Did you go to school in those clothes? You must be freezing. You stink. - When did you last wash? - Yeah, all right. Mum isn't looking after you. She's not there. How so? Since when? I think it's three days. Three days! Why didn't you say? I didn't want you to get angry. - Anyway, you can't do anything. - Where is she? - On holiday. - Who with? I don't know. She just said it was for a rest. Why didn't you tell me? Because you always get angry! It's worse if I'm not told! Where are you going? - I don't want to sing today. - Wait! Don't follow me, stay where you are. Marion! When's she back? Has she got another new man? - Why didn't you call Louise? - She'd have got angry too. I didn't want to bother her. And she can't drive now with her belly. - Did she at least leave you some money? - No, she forgot, but I can manage. What an arsehole! You see, I shouldn't have told you! Is there a problem? Is smoking forbidden? No! Over there. Was she with him? When she left you all on your own. Yeah, I think so. It's too short. Pass me the amp, please. You know very well, don't you? Is he at home now? What's his name? Anyway she wasted no time! Think he'll stay? I don't know. What's his name? Hervé. His name's Hervé. She says she feels safe with him. Safe, what from? Who from? I'm cold. Shall we sing? Let's pick up Gloria in Excelsis Deo. Page 12. I don't know this one very well. Three, four... Angels we have heard on high Sweetly singing o'er the plains And the mountains in reply Echoing their joyous strains Hey. What are you doing with the piano? Why did you move it? What am I supposed to do? Want me to look at it all the time? Do you? I supported you all with this piano. Has anyone told Margaret she's rendered me half deaf? Yes, she knows. She knows. - I didn't hear you. - She knows. What did she say? Still talking about her? Hervé's right. I'll drop the subject. Oh sweet Lord, my only friend... You who can read our hearts and souls tell me whether Mum will one day find true love. Love which lasts for ever and does good. May this love reign over our family. Forgive my lies, I wasn't able to tell the truth. If my sister finds out how much she hurt my mother the devil will take hold of her again. I beg You make us reunite in peace. I place my trust in You. If this is too great a request, Lord, forgive me. If You consider it just, may the angels come to my aid. Every day I shall sing praises to Your name and devote myself to You. May Your will be done. Amen. Well now! Shall we take the biggest one? Look, Mum. Angel Gabriel. Oh yes. - Which one is it, do you think? - That one there. Give me a hand. It'll be beautiful! He's the bringer of good news. Oh yes. You can tell it's him by his big wings. Yes. But we're not going to buy up the shop. I'm so happy to be celebrating Christmas as a family this year. Margaret won't be there. Do you realise, with any luck Louise's little ones will be there. It'll be my first Christmas as a young grandmother! - Don't shout, Mum. - I'm not shouting! Hang on, hang on! I'd like to surprise Hervé. He's always wearing the same T-shirts. These are nice. What do you think? What size do you think he takes? I don't know him well enough. M or I. Are you mad? He's not M! He's at least I. Which colour do you like best? This one or that? - This one. - You think? You don't miss a thing! Caught in the act. I'm sorry. Just waiting for my wife and daughter. There's the little one now. - Mum asked what size you are. - M or I. - What do you reckon? - I don't know. Take a look. Ok, I've seen. You were a long time. My mother's waiting for me at home. Know how to open up a camp bed? Seen where the covers are? Yeah. There's a bit left. Do you want it? - It's home-made. - Thanks. Thanks to you. The nights depress me in the end. Just one thing. We don't normally talk to customers, OK? We just survey them. Unless they're family. Ok? Right, good night. Go ahead. Marion? Come and give me a kiss? - Good night. - Good night. Marion! Will you give Hervé a kiss? Stop it, you're making her uncomfortable. Good night. Good night. - Marion, your sister! - Why's she there already? She doesn't dare cross the line! I bet she's been beaten up again! Marion, you'll have to repaint it, it's all fading! Hello, Marion. What's going on? - What? - What's going on outside? I'm getting rid of the piano. Hervé found a buyer. There'll be no more music in this house. Never again. Mum, we need to complete these papers. What's the percentage? What percentage? The percentage of the disability allowance. I want nothing from these people. I sacrificed everything for you. Now it's your turn to help me. I'm pregnant, Mum! I'm not working! Marion is twelve years old! And you want nothing to do with Margaret! Excuse me. We're going to move the piano. - Oh, yes, sorry. - Sorry. Mum? You've lost half your hearing. You can't give piano lessons anymore. You just need to fill these out, please. Then you'll get a small allowance. All right? Mum? - Mum! - Don't shout, it hurts! I'm not completely deaf. I don't want people to say I'm disabled. As if I were in a wheelchair. That's true, Louise. Mum isn't disabled. Right, I give up. I've got a doctor's appointment. I'm off. Do that! Go and give birth! We'll do these forms later on. The stool, please. - Sorry? - The stool. Can you wait a moment? But that's Margaret! Sorry? Margaret is out there. - What? - Margaret is out there! I don't know. Maybe. Why is she there? What's she doing? Mum really was a great pianist. Maybe she'll have more time to look after you now. - Is she often there? - Who? Margaret. Quite often. - Meaning? - Almost every day. - Every day at the side of the road? - Yes. I'm worried she'll see the piano go past. She doesn't know about Mum's hearing. - Didn't you tell her? - No. - Has no one told her? - No. You're crazy! Why not? I didn't dare. I was afraid she'd explode again. This family is impossible! - Shall I let her come over? - Yes, let her. - Hi. - Hi. I didn't know you were still around. I'm giving Marion singing lessons. Oh, yes, she said. That's kind of you. Otherwise, all OK? Yes, I'm fine. Have you seen Mum? Apparently she's getting better. Oh, yes, she's fine. Want to touch? Marion, are you coming? Can you feel? Louise, are you OK? I think it's started. We have to go now! Hey, sisters, wish me luck! Next time I see you, you'll be aunties, twice over! What's wrong? Well, you're always everywhere. Wherever we go, you're there. You're here almost more than before. It's as if you were surveying us. - Did you tell Hervé who you were? - No. What are you doing? You go there and I'll go here. I can hear myself better this side. The mountains reflect the sound better. Day of joy Day of victory He reaches out His hand to me Draws me from deep waters Takes hold of me and delivers me The Eternal Father is my support In the face of all my enemies He rises up in radiant glory And walks before me Are you OK, Marion? Are you OK? Night draws in, fear drives me My thoughts persist, my body drags itself along Full of fear and I sense others play a part The shadows fade, madness reminds me I fear my mind that blanks And my heart that beats That's beautiful. I haven't got all the lyrics yet. Mum said you were talented and you wasted it. The past weighs heavy But it's in my body, my skin The past is heavy Like a dead weight The past is there Taking a measure of me Judging and eating away at me And I don't know why you forgive me still The past weighs heavy But it's in my body, my skin The past weighs heavy, laying claim To eulogies of the dead The past is wretched But I thread it through with pearls and music The past is vain And there's little I regret And there's little I regret Happy Christmas. Oh my baby. Can you give me her, please? Can you hold my blouse, please? There we are. Is that too loud? No. Two times a grandmother. It's a strange Christmas present. Wait, I'll serve you. Marion, stop that. There we go! I'll just use your phone a second. You there? Wait. Yes, I see you. Look. See how pretty it is. See the reindeer down there? Hervé set it all up. What are you up to? Hervé says their crying is too loud for Mum. As if they wanted to piss off their grandmother. Bring the babies over. Listen, that's your nieces crying. - Do you hear them? - Yes. Want to speak to Margaret? She's up there. See the light? What's she doing? Has she nothing better to do? Can I have my phone? The caterer should be here by now. - We can go and talk to her if you like. - What, up there? No, by the line. Don't you want to show her them? Go out in the cold with my babies! Are you mad? Right, I have to go, Margaret. See you later. Yeah, see you later. To love. To love. That's it. To love. To love everywhere on Earth. To love. To our little ones. To Lucie and Clara! Right... It's my first Christmas without a piano. What was most precious has been taken from me. But... love came to fill this void. I... Go on, get the present. I'd like to thank Hervé for the support... and the love he has given me since he arrived. Hervé is a miracle. I don't think I could have picked myself up without him. Thank you, Hervé. I thank you with all my heart and my body. Doing the presents this early? No, that's just a taster for Hervé. Go ahead. It was Marion who chose it. Well, thank you, Marion. - You don't mind, do you? - No. - Do you like it? - Yes. - Try it on. - Here? Yes, why not? Are you embarrassed? Oh, he's modest! - They left the price on! - You can do that later. Of course it wasn't done on purpose. No, I said "You can do that later". I said to the shop assistant, "Leave the price on..." Thanks. It's great. - Thank you, Marion. Good choice. - Yes. Maybe it's a bit big, but... Big enough for two. Do you want to try? Then I'm coming too. We won't all fit. But don't rip my present. Stop it, Mum. Oh, it feels good. Will you stop it, Mum! Stop it! Do you want to hit your mother too? That's the caterer. One moment of fun! Happy Christmas, Margaret! Thank you. Here. - That's for you. - Thank you. And that's for Louise and the little ones. And that's for Mum. Give that to her, will you? Yes. Put it under the tree. Hey, sisters! Aren't you frozen? - Hi. - Hi. Look, Margaret has got us presents. Oh, thank you. I don't have one for you. I didn't expect you. It doesn't matter. This is Clara. This is Margaret, the sister you don't know yet. The other one is inside. She's more fragile. But she's the same anyway. I can tell them apart. Want to hold her? Here. Does Mum know I'm here? She does now. We should be eating. She looked everywhere for you. Is she planning to come or not? No, I don't think so. Couldn't she make a truce for Christmas? We'll tell her. But I can't promise. Can you take her back? Everything's cold now. Even without being here, she's managed to spoil Christmas for us. Mum, you should go and see her. Louise, if your baby cries it's difficult for me to hear you. Look what she gave me. Ok. She got you something too. I'm not interested. Have a look at it at least. - Open it and go and see her afterwards. - Right. I don't like the colour. Give it back to her. Just pop out and give her a wave. - Did you hear what she just said? - Yes, I did. You can't leave her waiting outside like a dog. I'll go, but with Hervé. With Hervé, where's that? I think she'd rather see just Mum. She's right. It's not a good idea to go with her. What's she like? Is she calm, agitated? She's normal. Normal doesn't mean a thing when it comes to your sister. Mum? Mum? Wait, Mum. What are you doing? Mum, why won't you talk to her? Fuck it, Mum! Talk to her! Don't do that, Margaret. Mum, I just want to talk! I won't hurt you! - Mum, can you hear me? - Stop! - You can't. - I just want to talk to her. - Come on! - I just want to talk to her! - She can't hear you! - Why won't she answer? - I said, she can't hear you! - Mum! Since your fight she can't hear properly! What? When you hit her, you made her half deaf! I didn't know. Come on. Come on, Margaret. - Come on. - Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me? Why did you have to come? Go away! Why didn't anyone tell me? Go now! Go away. Why didn't anyone tell me? Why didn't anyone...? Mum? Forgive me. Forgive me. I don't fight anymore. I won't hurt you, Mum. Look, I don't fight anymore. Look. Look, I don't fight anymore. Look... I don't fight anymore. I just want to talk to you. I just want to talk to her. Look, I don't fight anymore. - I just want to talk to her! - Go away. Move it! You're not staying here! Calm down! Stop! Go back your side of the line! Let go of me! Go on, catch! Hey what are you doing? Guys, I found a pair of panties! Don't you touch this! Stop it, I said! 'Scuse me! Where do we put Margaret's things? Just there, on the mound. That looks like blood. No, that's not blood. Kids, don't you touch anything! Hey, look at all this stuff! Lord, have mercy on me, blood was shed on the day of Your son's birth. And I, who sing Your praises, did nothing to prevent it. I feel as stained as when Judas betrayed Jesus. Lord, I beseech you, help me to love my mother and sister together without ever betraying anyone. Is she talking to God? She looks like Virgin Mary! She's been like that for at least two hours. Maybe she really is talking to God. Lord, bring love and peace to us. - There's too much hate in my family. - Marion! Stop this. Everyone's looking at you. It's absurd. Where is she, Lord? Your infinite grace alone will help us. I trust in You. You are love. Margaret will come back. Marion, please get up. Come on. Come on! Come on. - I'm praying for us all, Mum. - What? I'm praying for us all. We don't need your prayers. Come on. There's blood on the line, Mum. What? Where is there blood? On the line. Blood shed on Christmas night. It's a very grave sin, you know. Don't keep reciting The Bible. Come on. Look. - But that's not blood. - It is blood, Mum. Listen, it's a cat or dog. Stop it! No, it's Margaret. No! Marion, are you mad? Do you want to get rabies? Come on! Damn, what did they do? So she was under an order, a... A restraining order. A restraining order. She came as near as she could every day to see us. Yes, 100 metres. We haven't heard from her for several days. Her work hasn't either. We wanted to know if you knew where she is. What does she want? She wants a breast, but I can't now. Sorry? Give her your finger. Yes. Yes, all right. I see. What did they say? - Is it Lucie? - I don't know. No, it's Clara. What did they say? What did the police say? They said a restraining order is to restrain people from contact. - They're not entirely wrong. - Yes, all right. When is her restraining order up? I don't know. When's it over? In exactly 14 days. - I counted from the start. - How long? - 14 days. - So we just have to wait 14 days. What if something's happened to her? We'd have been informed if she was in hospital. She might be in the canal. The canal? What nonsense! I taught all three of you to swim. What are you doing? Getting rid of the line. Today's the last day. Oh, it's today. What if she doesn't come back? Well, she hasn't come to get her stuff. Can you manage with that brush? Yeah, yeah. Careful you don't make a mess. More brushes under the sink, if you need. No, it's fine. Do we know when she might arrive? I don't know. I think in the afternoon. She's a pain playing with our nerves. How far have you got? Up to the bridge. Still a bit of road and field to do. Louise wants us to call her if we have any news. - What? - A bit of field. I'll just make a coffee then I'll help you. You here too? Well, yeah. I've come to wait for her too. As you never called me back. Is that where you did your lessons together? Yes. It's weird. Hard to know if 100 metres is far or not. The view from here is lovely, isn't it? With the mountains. Is that you? Yes. I was pregnant, I remember. With me? No, with Margaret. I was 20. You were beautiful, Mum. Well, yes, I haven't always been old and disabled. Louise, have you got a music system in your car? Go on. It's an eternity since I listened to myself. You have to be made of strong stuff. Go on. Turn up the sound. I can't hear it very well. You see, Louise, they're enjoying listening to their grandmother. Maybe one of them will be a musician. Or both of them. Who knows? There were two famous pianists, twins. What were they called again? - Twin, Twin something...? - Muse. That's it! TwinMuse. The TwinMuse. Hair like this. They played four-handed. What's wrong with her? Is she asleep? Marion? She's hardly eaten anything for days. Why didn't you say? What could I do? She refuses to eat. She thinks it will bring back your sister. Open your mouth. I've put it up to six. Good night. She only wants to talk to God now. Margaret! Margaret! Margaret! Come on! They're all waiting for you. Come on for God's sake. Come on... Come on, come on. What is it? Want to fight? Night draws in, fear drives me My thoughts persist, my body drags itself along Full of fear and I sense others play a part The shadows fade, madness reminds me I fear my mind that blanks And my heart that beats so openly As if stripped before you I'm afraid to understand That the moon was beautiful In a flash I'm one of those Who flee and stay silent, Favouring the day before I fear my defeats and my recurrent cycles I fear I will shatter And you won't hold onto me Fear of this helplessness That courses in my veins But I have no fear of losing my way Of losing track At night in my dead ends That seem so strange I have no fear of falling asleep Gently hoping No fear of succumbing in a thundershower And having your regrets as my sole legacy No fear of veering off-course Of my je-ne-sais-quois No fear of seeking the sun in your shade Of looking at the sky as we challenge the world No fear of believing still And that is worth something That is worth something Good evening. Mum? She's here. Coming down? - Go on. - I'll tell her you're here. Hello. How are you? I'm OK. Have you seen? It's different without the piano. It left a big gap, so... We changed it round a bit. I'll leave you to get ready. I'm off to work. Anyway, I can't find my summons. I can help you find it. What does it look like? Anyway, what difference would it make? It's too late. The damage is done. It's a court hearing, Mum, with the judge. - Don't shout, Louise. - You have to attend. I'm not shouting. You will also be heard by the judge, Mum. But we can sort it out between us. We're a family. No, we can't sort it out! It's too late, you said so yourself! Margaret will be judged. I'll take the little ones out. Best to spare them. Spare them from what, Mum? Ok, I'm not saying another word. Bye. - Marion, shall I drop you at school? - Coming. Wait grandma, I'll help you. Good luck! Let us know. Have you seen? They're building there. No more view. What do you think of it? I'm afraid of appearing disabled. Right, I think I'll make a tea. Oh, you know, the babies are constantly ill. Ever since your sister stopped breast-feeding. It's not going too well, it seems. She couldn't with her work. Expressing her milk, it's difficult. And one of them is allergic to cow's milk. They didn't know at first. I think it's Lucie. Or maybe the other one. I still get them confused. No, it's Lucie. It's Lucie who's allergic. Well, anyway... But, you see, you three are all healthy and I never breast-fed you. No, I did try to breast-feed you for a few days. But you didn't want my breast. I had milk but you didn't want it. Anyway, from the time you were in my womb you did what you wanted. You punched much more than the others for instance. Oh, by the way, Louise and I were thinking: What if we held Marion's Communion and the babies' christening on the same day? What do you think? It would cut down on costs. Do you think you can come? Well, we'll see.
