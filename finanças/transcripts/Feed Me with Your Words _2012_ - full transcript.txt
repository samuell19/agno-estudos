FEED ME WITH YOUR WORDS -This time I'm going alone. I'm not a child any more. I took care of everything. You have your job to do, and I have my research. I'm looking for something new, something no one has ever done. And I'm going to find it. This time I'm going alone. I'm not a child any more. I took care of everything. You have your job to do, and I have my research. I'm looking for something new, something no one has ever done. And I'm going to find it. I'm going to find it. I. SEARCHING THE PAST -I am looking for tickets to New York. Bjarne Mastebroek exhibits at MOMA. He is the one who did the Self Sustainable hotel in the Swiss Alps. Good day. No, a person was watching me. I will call you when I come to the office, ok? Ok, bye. -Hi. -Hi. -Hey Matej, when I finish I'll come for the blueprints? -They are waiting for you. -Thank you. FATHER -Having a crappy day? You're only into blues when you're in a bad mood. -Don't you have Muddy's Breaking It Up? -It's not there anymore? -No. -I probably have one or two in the back. I'll take a look. FATHER -Tell me. Where? When? What about mom? You can't just leave her alone. Which Ana? Just how exactly do you imagine Ana will take care of mom? Where should I leave the child? What should I do with Veronika? Can you stop, please? Just stop. You can't boss people around like this. -Matej? Hey, Matej. -What are you doing? -I can't sleep. -Ana? Ana? -Hey. -Hey. -Hello, daddy. -Hi, honey. -Would you please take these things to the kitchen? -Yes. -Did you call me? -My father called. -Did something happen to your mom? -No, mother is fine. My father needs help. -He hasn't called you in 10 years and now he needs help? -My brother travelled to Italy and now there is no word from him. This isn't like him. I have to go. -Yes, of course, just go. -It isn't that simple. Someone has to stay with mother. -I can't. I'm really busy right now. My deadline is up this week. I haven't seen her in 10 years. She's demented and I don't know how to deal with it. Sorry, I really can't. -If my father can look after her... -What am I supposed to do with Veronika? -Take her along. She'll be happy to meet her grandparents. -I'm not sure. -Ana, it's for two days. I have to go for two days, please. -Mommy, can we go? I really want to meet grandma. -Hello, mom. It's me, Matej. -Oh, that's right. Matej. -You've got gray hair. -Yes, I do a few. -Good day. -Good day. -I am Veronika. -I am Irina. -Hello, Janez. -Hello. -Hello, Irina. -Good day. -I am Veronika. -Hello. -Are there any animals here? -Animals? No. -Don't you have any kittens? -No, no kittens. Are we going? -Where are we going? -To the police station. -Italian police... I was a policeman myself, remember... -I kept quiet till now, but now it's your turn to listen! We are in a foreign city, where you don't understand a word! Robert is missing and we need help! Is that clear? -Ok then, if that's what you think. -We've been waiting here for half an hour and nothing is happening. -Just wait. -I know the Italian police. They are completely inefficient. -Please, calm down. Have some trust. Why are you in such a hurry? Is there something I don't know? -I need to know why your brother came here. -What is he saying? -Why Robert came here. -Follow me. -He was working on some research and he thought he could find some relevant information here. -You speak Italian well. -I studied in Italy. -Good. -What kind of research did your brother do? -In his spare time, my brother dealt with graphology. -Graphology, that's something connected to writing, isn't it? -It is a science studying handwriting. You can understand what kind of person is who wrote it. -And your brother? -He wanted to do the opposite. -Try to be more specific. So? -My brother believes he can discover the handwriting of Jesus. -What did you tell him? -Wait. -We checked the address of the hotel where your brother stayed. The hotel Posta. Your brother was quite unassuming, and they couldn't say when was the last time they had seen him. -What are you going to do now? -We will search the room tomorrow. -What did he say? Domani (tomorrow)? No tomorrow, no tomorrow. -Wait, please. Sorry. Why waiting until tomorrow? -Your brother is an adult... Just because someone doesn't call every day it doesn't mean he's in trouble. Why does he have to call anyway? -My mother suffers from dementia. Robert is almost the only person she is able to recognize. -What nonsense is he speaking now? I knew they were incompetent! -Sorry. Here is my number and we will hear tomorrow. Thanks. -We are going to rent two separate rooms. -Are you worried I might see you naked? -Maybe I don't want to see you naked. -Room 121. -Thanks. -Ask him which room Robert is staying in. -The police will arrive tomorrow. Let them investigate. I won't. -Ask him if I tell you so. -I won't. -Don't make such a fuss. -Ask him yourself! -What's happening? -Robert's room. -Shall we go there? -Let's wait for the coppers to go away. Come inside. -We still haven't found Robert. You two? What? What's wrong? That's ok. I'll be home soon. Yes, I hope so. I miss you. I'll call you later, I'm at the cashier. Give a kiss to the kid. Bye! -Can I take you to a restaurant? Some pasta, a pizza... Something warm. We've eaten this ten times today. -Stop being an annoying little brat. You've always been like that. -No, I haven't. You wouldn't let me. -Let's go inside if you already opened it. -Hey, how did you open that door? -Don't touch anything. -Look, I found a bill from a tavern where he ate. We have to find this place. -Good evening. -Good evening. -I am looking for my brother. He disappeared a few days ago. We think he was here. Do you remember him? -I do. He was looking for a bum. -What is he saying? - A bum? Any idea where he went? -I don't know, but he acted strange, not in a normal way. -What did he say? That he is not normal? -That he acted strange. -Who is not normal? -Hey! Get out! Get out! -Sorry. Sorry. -Here. Come on. Can you tell me what happened to you? -This guy can't say that my son isn't normal. -Look, he said something about a bum and we should find him. Come, let's go back to the hotel. -How are you doing? Is everything ok? Please, take your pills. Me and Matej are in Italy... in Italy. You'd really like the music here. We'll be home soon. Bye bye. -Why did you let Robert travel? -I just did. -How much is Robert still into this research? I don't think it's normal that someone spends over ten years examining Jesus's handwriting. -You don't know what normal means. You haven't lived with us in 20 years. Your mother's illness has nothing to do with Robert. He is dedicated to his research and this is it. -Five hours ago we found your brother's car in the city suburbs. We do not know what business he had there. In the car we found a receipt of a library. But there is nothing similar of interest in that part of town. And another thing. Someone broke into your brother's room. Hey, you are not allowed to touch the car. -Let's go. We can't get any useful information here. -Thanks. -Hey Ana. What happened? What's wrong with her? That's because she didn't take all of her pills. Wait a moment. Why don't you let them help us? -They can't help. I will do it alone! -Here I am. Yes, what? The kid behaves in a strange way because she never lived in the countryside. Mom is not influencing her, what's wrong with you? Calm down and have something to drink. Robert's room? What's wrong with it? Look honey, everything will be ok. We didn't find Robert yet. As soon as we find him, I will come home. I have to go now. Everything will be ok. Bye. -Robert! Robert! Robert! -Are you sure that was actually Robert? I run here for nothing. -Can you now tell me what is happening to my brother? -He's a grown up man. -I can't understand why he has to call you every five minutes. You didn't even let him have his own life. When I tried to take him to Ljubljana, you were against it and that's when we stopped talking. -Yes, yes. Turn here. There are some bums there. -Wait here. -Good day, I need some help. Have you seen this person? -I have a pretty bad memory. -My memory is even worse. -Can you give us some help? -Yes. Yes, please. Hello? Hello? Yes, we are coming. -This is not Robert. This isn't my son! -Stop, please. -Leave me alone. -Can you stop, please? You have to calm down, we must decide what to do. Stop behaving like this. -You can't tell me what to do! I am your father! -Fathers are supposed to be caring and nothing like you! -What am I like? -You're just like your father! -What? -You keep sticking your own shit in our faces. -You have no idea what my father was like. -But I know exactly what you are like. -Tomorrow, we are going to the train station. If he was looking for a bum, I'm sure he checked that place. -Good day... Could you help me, please? -Yes. -Have you seen this man? Do you know him? -Yes. He caused all kinds of trouble here. -Do you know where he went? -He left by train going to Austria. The conductor kicked him off by the lake just before the border. -Thanks. Let's go. He took a train headed to Austria. -Turn there. There is something there. -These are his clothes? -Yes. -Robert! Robert! II. LOSING THE PRESENT -We're all out of yogurt. Let's take four or so. -Can we take these with fruits? -No, these are too sweet. Take the plain ones instead, 1.3. -But these are tastier. -But those are healthier. Did you check the expiry date? -Yes. -Very good. -Hey. -Hey. -Hi, dad. -Hi, kid. -Could you please take these things to the kitchen? -Yes. -Did you call me? -My father called. -Did something happen to your mom? -No, mother is fine. My father needs help. -He hasn't called you in ten years and now he needs help. -My brother travelled to Italy and now there is no word from him. This isn't like him. I have to go. -Where did you put that warm t-shirt you got for your birthday? -In the suitcase. -Are you happy to go? -Yes. -But your granny is a little bit special. But everything will be ok. We will be nice to her, and she'll be nice to us. Ok? -Mom, let's sing our song. -Ok. Hey, hey, city girls, where are you going? Nice flowers, proud creatures. Beautiful city girls. Youthfulness passes too quickly. Don't you know that? -Can you give me a minute? -Yes. -Wow, this house is huge. So this is my granny. She is just how I imagined her to be. And this is granddad. He looks just like dad. Why are we waiting here? I'll go there. -Wait. -This is it. It's nice, isn't it? -Where is the toilette? -Downstairs, on the right. -And wash your hands. -Does your mother know who I am? That I'm your wife? -Now, she didn't even know who I am. Everything will be ok. Everything will be ok. -Look, here are the pills. It is important she takes them just like it says here! Please, don't leave her alone. She doesn't go anywhere, but you never know. -You never know what? Matej! -Let's go to the store and buy some food. -Is grandma coming with us? -Grandma is resting. Let's go by ourselves. -Mom, can we take this, too? -There are too many artificial sweeteners inside. Put it back. -Excuse me, do you sell soy milk? -I'm sorry, madam, only cow's. -Please give me some whole grain bread then. -We only have white bread. Are you the daughter-in-law of Irina and Janez? -They are my grandma and grandpa. -Is this your first time here? -Yes -So, how are you and grandma getting along? -Well. -Please give me that whole grain bread. -White. -White, yes. -Good day. -Good day. -Look. -Nice. -Veronika? Veronika? Veronika? -She went upstairs. -Thanks. I prepared the pills for you on the table. -Thanks. -Why didn't you wait downstairs? -I was looking for a room where I can sleep. -You're sleeping with me. -I like this one. I'd like to sleep here. -This isn't your room. -Whose room is it? -Robert's. -Who is Robert? -Your uncle, daddy's brother. -Where is he? -He went to Italy. -That means I can sleep here. -You will sleep with me. We'll have a great time. Come on, let's go. -Mommy, do you like grandma? -Of course. I don't know her very well, but of course I like her. Time to sleep now. -You said we have to sleep. -Yes. -Irina? -And then he said, that he will come back... -Breakfast is ready. -Let granny finish the story. -Come on, Veronika. -Just a little bit. -Breakfast is on the table. -I'm not hungry! -Listen to me, please! Let's go! -Hey honey, when you're done just get undressed so we can take a shower. -I won't have a shower. -Of course you will. You are dirty. -No, I won't. -What's wrong with you, Veronika? At home you never act like this. -I'm not taking a shower! -Get undressed, let's go in the shower. -No! No! No! -Hey. How are you? Really? No, ok. Veronika is a bit weird. She's acting strange. No, Irina, she wants to be with her all the time. Yes, of course it is. You will find him. I miss you, too. Yes, bye. -Come, let's go to the store and get some bread. -I'm not going. -We could use a walk. -I'm drawing. -You're staying here alone? -Yes. -Ok, I will go alone. -Ok. -Hey. What happened to your hair? -Grandma showered me. -Irina, I don't wat to be... Irina. Irina. -I answer the phone around here. This is my house. -Irina, I'm sorry. It was Janez, but he suddenly hung up. The phone just kept on ringing. I'm not going to do it again. Good night. -Who are you? What are you doing in my house? -I am Ana, Ana, Matej's wife. Your son's wife. -Matej isn't married. -Of course he is, for twelve years and Veronika is our daughter. -Veronika isn't your daughter, she is my friend. She is... -It's all ok. Ana is just on a short visit here. -Your mother must be affecting her. I'm not calming down! Veronika is acting in a strange way. Both are strange. Did you see Robert's room? Were you inside? Stop saying this, I will take the suitcases, Veronika and return to Ljubljana. I will leave Irina. I miss you. Yes. Ok. I will. -Not so strongly. Not so strongly. -Let her go! Let her go! -What happened? -Nothing. Look, what a beautiful day. Let's go to the river. -Yes. -Would you like a glass of water, too? -Thanks. -You can't sleep either? You want to take a walk outside? The night is beautiful. -Veronika? Veronika? Veronika! Veronika! Please work. Please work. -Where is Veronika? -On the sofa. She is sleeping. I was worried about you. -Now you know who I am? -Mom! -Let's go upstairs. -You can't do this. You can't just vanish like that. -But I was with granny. -But you have to tell me. -Mom, I would like to sleep some more. -Yes, go. -Mom, you were unconscious. How was it? -Great. -Me and Grandma looked after you. -There is some tea for you, Katja. -Ana. -Granny thinks you're also her childhood friend. Shell we sing you a song? Beautiful Annie leading the dance, beautiful Annie leading the dance, beautiful Annie leading the dance, beautiful Annie leading the dance... III. FINDING THE FUTURE -This time I'm going alone. I'm not a child any more. I took care of everything. You have your job to do and I have my research. I'm looking for something new, something no one has ever done. This time I'm going alone. I'm not a child any more. I took care of everything. You have your job to do and I have my research. I'm looking for something new, something no one has ever done. And I'm going to find it. I'm going to find it. -Robert. -You really think going alone is a good idea? -Where are you going, Robert? -To Italy for a couple of days. I'll be back very soon. -What do you expect to find there? This research of yours is just a massive waste of time. You think people will start treating you differently then? And this gibberish of yours, what is it called? -Calligraphy. -No one cares about it. What if something happens to you there? -Like what? -I don't know, lots of things. And you can barely speak Italian. -Of course I can. I took lessons, I have them on tape. -I don't know, I really don't know. -It's my decision. I am going to Italy. You won't change my mind. -Italy. They have such wonderful music there. -Yes, mum. I'm always here, helping you with mom. Nothing can go wrong. I planned all. -Yes, yes. -Everything will be ok. You have the hotel address. I'll call you every day. -Where is the police station? -Where is the police station? -The police station is in the centre. -...in the centre. -Room 131. -Thank you. -Hello. Can I talk to mom? Hi, mom. Robert here. I am in Italy. -Are you thirsty? Wait here. -A beer. -Yes. -For you. -Tomorrow shall be the end of good and evil, everything you once were, no one shall know. Do not try to run, the end is near. -Good evening. -Good evening. -I was here yesterday. A kloshar was here with me. Do you know him? Does he come here often? -A clochard? A bum? -Yes, a bum. - I don't remember any bum. -Around sixty. Long bushy beard. -All the bums look like that. -How could you not have seen him? I was with him. -There are no bums here! -Hello. I know, sorry. I haven't been in the hotel yet, that's why I didn't call. I know that I had to. Look, something incredible happened today. Yes. I know. Hello? How can you be empty again! -I am looking for one of you. -Wich one? -The one who speaks about the end of the world. -Give me a euro. I will tell you everything. -Do you know who wrote this? -Do you remember me? Do you remember? I bought you a beer. You wrote something on a piece of paper. -I didn't write you anything. -Your calligraphy is the one I've been looking for. Why do you write like that? Who are you? Tell me, who are you? I must know. It's important. Tell me who you are. -Tell me who you are. -Buy me something to drink. Alcohol. -Thanks. -Thanks. -Give me a smoke! Give me a smoke! Damn you people! When the end comes, God will hand out his punishment to each of you! Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place. -Come, come. Leo, come. -Leo. -I will distract the saleswoman, while you run out of the store. -I have money. We can buy this. -I will do it alone. -No, wait. -I understand. I'll do it. -Do you know the end of the world is nigh? Just a little while and the great flood will cleanse this entire filthy world. Putting an end to all this debauchery and perversion. God shall no longer forgive. -Get up. You aren't allowed to sleep here. Get up. You can't stay here. -Where is he? -What are you saying? -Where did he go? -I don't understand you. -Where did he go? -Who? Come on, let's go. -He has abandoned me! -Who? -Jezus (Jesus). -Jezus? You're still drunk! -Where are you? -Come on, let's go. Come on! -Wait! I'm not going anywhere! Let go of me! -Good day. Ticket please. Thanks. Good day. Tickets. Have a nice trip. Ticket, please. -When the train stops, we are going to jump off. -The ticket, please. Hey, where are you going? Please show me the ticket. What were you doing inside? -Wait for me! -Where are you going? -Let go of me! -Where did you go? Why did you leave me? Was I not worthy of you? I did everything! Everything!
