I'm now a highly educated CFO and I would like to be treated with more respect. Congratulations.-Thank you. We'll increase my salary like we agreed,yes? I'll pay myself 10 percent more. If you could sign here. Öie, we can’t afford a raise. Are you joking? We had a deal. I do the excel spreadsheets myself. I know that we have money. I don't care about the spreadsheets, we're losing clients. Every time those Orientals lower their prices' some Svensson leaves. Exactly and that's what I wanted to talk about. These are the competition's products. And this is ours. We should think about our design a little. I made a sketch. I know I'm not much of an artist. A designer would make a better one, but... What do you think? We don't have the resources to make new products. Don't have the resources. SPEAKERS -€ 40000 Government doesn't help manufacturing in anyway. We're doing all we can, Öie. The raise,Aadu, we had a deal. We can’t afford that. Although...there is a way. You’re a nice girl, Öie. A nice girl... But you could be so much nicer. Much, much nicer... We invested 300000 Euros 8 months ago. And now you're saying it's all gone. It's not all gone.We hired 12 engineers, we localised the app in 22 languages. Mhm and how many users? Users is not a metric we are focusing on. At this early stage, we need to build a scalable platform. And how many users? - 68 sign ups. 68? - Eeh,yes. And out of those, how many are paying users? That's why we need more money. To hire sales and marketing functions. I think 500 000 would be enough. What the hell is this shit? Who bought beer with the company credit card? We had a summer event. I had to motivate the employees somehow. You have 62 users and zero revenue. - 68... How about motivating the investors for a change? Focusing on monetization at seed stage is the dumbest thing we could do. What is this for? To motivate the dog? It's not a dog. It's our Chief Happiness Officer. Chief what? Chief Happiness Officer. Aren't you? Have you ever run a business? Yeah, I'm the founder of four startups... Have you ever run a business? Do you even understand what that word means? Yes I do. - Damn it, shut up. My head is going to explode and we'll all be covered in blood. You need to notify the employees. The phone comes with us, it's company property. The dog comes with us as well. - What do you mean? Fed on company money, company property. Tönu, you're the best programmer that I know. But please don't start any more companies. For Tönu startups are like Doom. His favourite computer game. In Doom you fight, you die and you start over from the beginning. You fight, you die and you start over. You fight, you die and you start over. I became his co-player in this game. Öie, for heaven's sake, where are you off to like this alone again? You could talk to Aadu. You could get a raise. Mommy, I'm not going back there. I'm only going forward. Where are you even going to live? At a classmate's place. At Üllar's place. Mommy, put away your... I don't eat pumpkin. What are you even going to do? - Work. Please don't worry, please. I will manage. US TECHNOLOGY GIANT BOUGHT ROCKET WISE FOP A BILLION DOLLARS It's definitely a court case. You can't leave it like this. I can take this on myself. Üllar, no. He's there, I'm here and that's it. Understood. Our accountant is taking child leave. Would you be interested? - In a job? Of course. Super. I'll see what I can do. Maybe I can get you in for an interview. Listen... What do you think about this? Nothing comes out of those hackathons. Honestly, if someone tells me that they're working on an app, it's as good as me saying I do gangsta rap. In a word, they're making complete crap. Better go to the zoo. How can something that doesn't really exist be worth a billion dollars? Are you ready? I said, are you fucking ready? You all rock! Welcome to Pocket 48! I had already lost my job. What else was there to lose? Decentralized Ethereum blockchain, which means that we can guarantee 100 percent uptime. And no third party interference. I'm looking for developers to join the team. Okay, well done. Who's next? Soon, we will colonize Mars. It's a fact. But there's a huge problem. How the fuck are we going to have sex in low gravity? Every thrust propels your partner in the opposite direction. And no fornication means no colonization. So if you want to save the future of the human race, join our team! Who's next? -We build marketplace. Everyone can buy only best quality of marijuana. If you like marketplace, if you like marijuana, together we build future of marijuana! Is that even legal? - We don't sell marijuana, we just build marketplace. Everyone here is either a mad genius or just mad. I wasn't either of those. But Tönu, he was probably both. He was running late. You are approved. Wearing a newt-shirt, nervous and slurping a blueberry smoothie. He had to leave a good impression. And that's how we met. Rock on!! Look at where you're going! Watch where you're running! Let me guess, you're from the countryside and not used to city traffic? Let me guess, you're from your mother's apartment and not used to daylight? Oh look, you've got something on your face. Were you doing a mud mask? I'm a bitch? Co pedal that thing back to the countryside... Co pedal that thing back to the countryside... Going back was a mistake. Approved, if you can stay the fuckout of jail. Well, well, well. Seems like we're done here. Come on guys, I have a killer idea. STARTUP IN STEALTH MODE Killer or suicidal like your last one? - Come on, guys! Doesn't anyone want to be part of my unicorn? This guy will go bankrupt again. And that's how it happened. Wait, wait, listen! All the teams are already full, but mine has still has space. Come, let's build something cool together. What? I'm using the deep learning AI algorithms and augmented reality. Actually I haven't completely figured it out yet. You haven't figured it out yet? Yeah, we're in stealth mode. Don't worry about it, but it's going to be a rocket. Tönu, the best programmer in the world. Öie, and I'm not interested. You wouldn't be here if you weren't interested. Do you know why we have so many fatal bicycle accidents in Estonia? Because Estonians don't wear helmets. Why don't they wear helmets? Because the helmets are ugly. Hold this. What if we built Estonia's first pretty bicycle helmet? I like it, you're approved. Screw it, let's do it! What? Öie and Tönu, great job! You showed everybody that it's possible to build something real in 48 hours. Next up the team that solved sex on Mars. Hey listen, wait. Where are you going? - It was fun. What do you mean, tomorrow we'll pitch it to Kuusela. Pitch it? What's that... Ah, no. You can pitch it, I've got a job interview tomorrow. Don't you get it? - Get what? I'm on the blacklist. I mean, it's easy in Silicon Valley. If you fail, it's nothing, you just try again. If you screw something up in Estonia' that's it. Nobody trusts you anymore. Of course no one trusts you, if you keep going bankrupt all the time. Listen, that's what startups are all about. You try, you fail, you pick yourself up again and keep going. I've seen so many startups in my life. Believe me, this here... This is the most promising thing that has ever came out of a hackathon. Honestly. A mad genius or just mad. Please. Tönu seemed to be just mad. But for some inexplicable reason, his madness excited me. Oh, alright, let's pitch it! Mmm, bikedrive. Bikedrive? That's brilliant, it's like... I was only joking. That's the one, Bikedrive. Listen, order the logo. What's the valuation of our company? What valuation? What is our company worth? Design was 5 Euros. The 3D-print was 32. 48 hours of work. I'd say about 200 Euros. Greetings, Riivo Kuusela, angel investor. I'm listening. The company name is Bikedrive. Bikedrive. That sounds pretty cool. What's your valuation? To hundred... - 500000 Euros. It's pretty cool, I need to go, to get my girlfriend's dead parrot to the taxidermist with an ice-cream truck. To Paris, see you. Where did you get 500000 Euros? Wait, I don't get it. Design was 5 Euros, 3D-print was 32. Work hours, okay, I can include bus tickets' I can add... water, two times 0,5 liters. I don't get where you got 500000 from' because I can't get more than 200. Intellectual property. - I don't get it. I really don't get it. It's intellectual property. What's intellectual property? Me. Okay, I could include the cost of the papers... In Tönu's world, making a startup is like levels in Doom. The first level - idea. I haven't completely figured it out yet. You don't have to worry about it, but it's going to be a rocket. Second - prototype. Third - investors. 500000 Euros. Fourth - big investors, big money. And the fifth level - exit. That means selling your company to a bigger company. For a lot of money. Or in Tönu's case, losing everything. - Company property. What do you mean? Fed with company money, company property. We had reached level three. Tönu's goal was to find us an investor at any cost. Did you know that wearing a helmet makes cycling more dangerous? Yeah, it's true. UK scientists have determined that drivers give cyclists with helmets far less space. The helmet makes cyclists feel immortal. What’s this thing? - An app. Kuusela said that we need some kind of technological quirk. And you made an app? -Yes, wait. Look at this! Tönu! It works. It works. Let's make a pivot. A pivot. SCREWED Tönu was definitely mad. We agreed that I'll pitch my helmet and he'll pitch his app. We'll go with the idea that investors are willing to back. Like all cars have parking sensors, in the future all bicycles will be self-braking. Tönu and I want to produce the prettiest bicycle helmets in Estonia. And we need a loan for that. A few tickets are still left. Are you in? Look Tönu, startups are like a train leaving the station. Me, the investor, will jog along with it. And when I can no longer keep up, I'll jump aboard. But if the train is too slow, the investor will find a new' faster train. Okay, in this case we need your business plan. A cash flow forecast for 5 years and your budget. How much money are you putting in yourself? Our valuation is two million. What? -Two million. Are you joking? Are you here to con yourselves or did you come to con me? In two years time, all bikes will be self braking. We're raising 100k on a two mil valuation. Okay, I'm going to run the algorithm. We've built an AI to make the investment decisions. Computer says no. What do you think then? What do you think then? I just made a big investment. Seems exciting, but I don't have any free money. But I can help you with legal affairs. Reducing my normal rate considerably. 200 Euros, per hour. What do you think? Send me an email. So we're raising 100000 on a 2 million valuation. [speaking Finnish] [speaking Finnish] We typically are interested in start-ups which have a potential at least 1 billion dollars. Unicorns. And this here, we have... [speaking Finnish] [speaking Finnish] 800 million max. - So, this is too small for us. I don't understand, it's so cold. Did they leave? I don't know, I'd rather go begging than back to that guy. Don't you know anyone? I do. I'm not going there under any circumstance. Oh, what a cute dog. Very good that you're here. Tönu, tell me, what commands does he react to? I've noticed that he sometimes reacts to "sit" and "lie down". But "fetch" or 'run" does nothing. Does it know how to do anything at all? Or is he a startup dog too? As an educated man, you can see that this app will disrupt your business completely. If you're not on board right now, you can close your place down in a few years. Every journey must end at some point. We tried and we failed. Time to move on. Who is Palo Alto? - What do you mean? Literally. -What? Palo Alto. Oh, this? It's not a who. It's a place. Where? -Where? In Palo Alto. Okay, it was fun. Wait. I need to use the restroom, can I...? No, no, no. Come on, we'll eat soon. Sit down. Can I help you with anything? - No, no' no. You're a guest, please sit down. Öie told me that you're good with computers. Yes. Tell me, what's an algo-rhythm? An algorithm? -Yes. It's like a sequence of commands. It's like a recipe, like for a pork roast. The algorithm for a pork roast would be: Find a pig. Kill the pig. Bring the pig home. Heat up the oven. Put the pig in the oven. Take it out. It's obvious that you're an educated man. No one has been able to explain that to me yet. How is your company doing? A lot of clients? We are pre-revenue. - Pre-what? We don't have a turnover. Something like that also exists, yeah? Well well. How do you make a profit then? Monetization isn't our priority right now. We don't have a company. We had a stupid idea and no investor gave us money. I'm going to a job interview at Üllar's place tomorrow. Why do you want to go to the city? You could go work with Maie in the booth. She struggles there 24 hours a day. All of the annual reporting. She could really use an accountant. Mommy, I'm not going to work in Mate's booth. How much money do you need to keep making the helmets? 50k would give us about 3 months of runway. 50k? I don't have 50k, but I've got 2500 Euros. Oh, super. - No. Dad, no. My money, my decision. This is very good. We're not taking the money. I don't get why you're so mad. You should be happy, someone believes in you. Your family believes in you. No one believes in me. Do you know how long he's been saving up for it? It's for his anniversary. We're not taking my family’s last savings. They're not savings, he's investing. He's investing and when we're going to be a unicorn, he'll get it back. It's his opportunity, not ours. Do you want to go to Mate's booth or what? Where would I even live? At Üllar's place? - No! I've got a pretty cool condo in Mustamae. We can set up our office there, we can sleep there as well. On one condition. You sell your car. If my family invests it's last savings, you must invest something too. Yes, yes.Thank you. Daddy, you'll get it all back, I promise. Promise. More, you'll get much much more. This is a convertible note. With a valuation cap of 500 000 you now own 0.5 percent of our company. Congratulations. I don't understand much about your business but I know that you will manage. Cool condo? Did you bring me my medicine from the pharmacy? Yes, I did, it's in the fridge. You'll rub it on me later then, right? Yes, yes I will grandmother. Dear... what a surprise,Tönu. I never thought my eyes would see the day. Dear. Listen... - Welcome to the family! Thank you Tönu, thank you, dear. Yes, yes, dear, let's go now. Okay. Where do you sleep? Here. And where do I sleep? I'll clean up and make some space. The plan was simple. Tönu will write his self-braking bicycle code and me, an accountant from a small town factory' will start selling. That was a bad idea. Luckily Tönu had a classmate, who was a sales guru. Hey Tönu! Oh, what a cool condo. Cool beard. Norris. And you are? - Öie. Hipster beard, helps me sell. Moved into your grandma's place with a girl' eh? ...and you know what happened then? He bought all of it! The whole bag! All of it! At 3 AM in a petrol station. No! -Yes, it was a pony. - Pony? Pony. Don't you know what a pony is? You know what, pony's aren't cool anymore. You know what's cool? - Well? Unicorns. You're funny. Hey, Jeff. How are you doing on this wonderful day? My name is Norris, I'm the one who has been talking to all the CEOs around here. Excuse me? - I guess you haven't heard about me. Didn't Steve, Mark or... Beezo mention I would call you? How can I help you? - I guess you really haven't heard about me. Strange that they didn't talk about me. Tell you what... Can you please tell me the name of the person you wish to speak with. Jeff. It's Jeff, your CEO. If you want to get in touch with our company, you need to fill out the contact form on our website. Ah, okay, have a wonderful day' mam.Thank you. It's in the can! Now you'll go to their website, fill out the form and ka-ching, pump out the money. Everybody buys. Kevin, how you doing? My name is Norris. I'm the one who has been talking to all the CEOs around here. What is that guy doing? - Sales. Didn't you hear, this guy is the best salesman in the world. It's a little different than selling books but... Selling books? - I mean those comics. Wait... He sells comic books to companies? To housewives. - Comic books to housewives? Yes and not just comic books. He's also sold pension funds and cable TV. And vacuum cleaners and I think those cups or bowls as well. Plastic ones that go into one another. So you basically have one bowl and you take it out of the cupboard... Those ones they sell. And the ladies get together, start mixing things. Tupperware. Alright Rich, I'll have my secretary call your secretary. What about me? I ordered a shirt for you. Hey Anna, thanks for calling back. How are you this fine morning? Wonderful, you're the best. By the way, I love your hair, yes' yes. Hello James. - Nice to meet you. Sorry you had to wait. -What a lovely office you currently have. Bathroom? don't you have some other place? - Yes, I'm... Yippee ki-yay. Öie, 50 of them. 50! Hello? 50 of them, didn't even ask,just bought them. James? He didn't even ask, he just bought them. James? - Ka-ching, jackpot, we're in business. Hey, I'd like take a leak. We needed money to make the helmets. And now that we had a potential client' we were more likely to attract investor interest. Until Tönu screwed everything up again. What are you messing around with now, what is this? It makes the bike brake on it's own. What's next? Self-driving bikes? Pivot! Let's make a pivot. I'll add one more thing. A few of hours of coding and it'll drive itself. Helmets. Then, self-braking bikes. And then, self-driving bikes! Look, investor money is like rocket fuel. If we put it in your old car, it will blow up. And your powerpoint, it's like Nigerian letter to investors. 25k. - What? 25k. With a 500k valuation, it'll give you a few months of runway. And then, whale shark hunting! Was he joking? No? Fix up your powerpoint. If a whale shark sees a soup like this, he'll just swim away. Wait, I don't understand, is he in or not? Of course he's in. Kuusela is the kind of guy, Who is already thinking about the next round. What's the next round? -VC round. What's a VC? -Venture capitalist. Investor, big investor, over a million. Where? -What do you mean, where? Anywhere. From Palo Alto. Wait, this is wrong. Oh my god, could you sound more like your mother? What? Öie, why are you in the city? What is this, women don't do business. Why don't you have children yet, Öie? Why aren't you married yet? Biological clock is ticking, tick, tick, tick. What logos are these? - Client logos. Did you put some random logos here or...? Logos of potential clients. And who are they? -Team. Not our team, but a team. Like a potential team. An example of a team. Fake it til you make it. Very good, let's go swimming. Investors are like sheep. They're herd animals. I would like to invest 300000 euros in your company. After Kuusela's investment, every angel investor wanted to give us money. Tönu says "no". Our sights were already elsewhere. Venture capitalists or VC's are the rock stars of Silicon Valley. The biggest of them is... Where's that limousine now? Tom Marcusson. When the strangest coincidence happened. Oh, Aadu. Aadu, it's you! Great timing. Can you drop us off in town? And then came the Russian crap and the Swedish margins shrunk. The government should help the industry back on it's feet. Industry. It's jobs, it's taxes. But instead, they support those damn apps. I can't pay the lease on my car anymore. How are you doing, Öie? - Good. I grew up on the crime side, Oakland East Bay side. Staying alive with no job. Then I started rolling with this one and that one. And then I got to Sand Hill Road. I'm not a racist, but I hate negro music. Was that too loud? My ex-boyfriend' he's got this app that allows you to play different music at each car seat Works great in his generation 2 Tesla Roadster' custom designed by Elon Musk. But it's going to take a while with these legacy vehicles. So guys, hit me with a quick elevator pitch. We are building a self-driving bicycle. A self-driving bicycle. Ballsy! - So we have a... That's a terrible idea. The idea of a bicycle is that you ride it. What's the point of a self-driving bicycle? It's the age old question whether something is crazy genius or just plain crazy. Stupid. I don't have anything against the queers, but I have to let you off here. But there is thatching. If everybody thinks that something is amazing. The big boys, they're going to eat you for breakfast' but if they think what you're doing is terrible, you might actually be onto something. Is the Uber guy going to stay with us all day? No? Okay. Listen, thanks pal. It was a very smooth ride for a basic car. Kuusela, make sure to give him five stars. It's not the Uber driver, Aadu is the captain of Estonia's manufacturing industry. Manufacturing, oh my gosh, as in like making physical things? He's an Uber driver, he just doesn't know it yet. Next up, our keynote speaker, the biggest superstar of Silicon Valley. Tom Marcusson, give a big applause! Tom Marcusson, give a big applause! Thank you, thank you. Today, tomorrow and for the rest of humanity' economic growth will not be driven by what's in the ground. What matters is what's in here. And you know this better than anyone. Your country was like any first time founder, you were broke, living in a dump and the guy next door was a fucking lunatic. But did you let that stop you? No. Estonia has shown the world that great companies can come from absolutely anywhere. Marcusson hasn't had a major deal since Facebook. That's why he keeps coming to Europe. The Russians are getting all the best deals. But every single technological breakthrough in human history was driven by someone who had no clue about what they were doing. Why? It takes someone who is naive enough to think that it can be done' when the whole world tells you "it can not". Someone who is willing to work insane hours for a crazy dream. A lot of these people will fail, success is extremely rare. Almost impossible. It's like finding a unicorn, a mythical creature. That almost doesn't exist. We need to pitch him again. He just said that it's the world's worst idea. But when success does happen, because it does. It is absolutely magical. And the world will never be the same again. Yes, Estonia.What's up people? What's happening? My latest with the greatest. You ready for this? A lot of VC's be like first time founders. They wouldn't see a good deal if it was right under their noses. But I'm so real totem, it's scary. My unique skills, no you can't compare me. I'm greater than all the VC's. When I breathe, give me room please. And you be happy as fuck to get a VC deal, because valuation grows like grass with mass appeal. Okay, okay, let me try. I'm not a startup-man, I'm a startup' man! Jay-Z, baby. So Tom, you're ready for a true Estonian start-up experience? Ballsy, bring it on! The whale shark won’t leave here until he invests. You want us to? - Wait, no, what... Start pitching. -The sauna isn't really my thing. Do you know where the Valley guys make the biggest deals? In a Starbucks? In a Starbucks? In the Nevada desert, at Burning Man. This here is Estonian Burning Man. Yeah! What? I'm not going to get naked. Tom! - I'm not gonna come in there. Where's the Valley guy now? He's waiting for Aadu's Uber to take him. Oh, there we go. Welcome. Do you know that there are 20 times more bicycles in the world than cars. In developing countries most people ride their bikes to work. What is this, a medieval Estonian torture technique? Unbearable heat combined with a bad start-up pitch? Did he just check out my memory stick? What if you could answer emails... - Or read a book. While driving your bike to work? Wouldn't it be super cool, Tom? And in 5 year's time... - All bicycles will be self-driving. Especially in China. Wouldn't it make sense to jump on the ship right now? - Right, Tom. Tom didn't jump on board, but Kuusela had a new plan. The whale shark has overheated, let's cool him down and pitch again. Tom! Then I understood that pitching to an investor doesn't work. The more desperately you try to get their money, the less likely they are to give it to you. And then I figured out what does work. Do you remember Juri?? - Do you like marijuana? Together we build future of marijuana. Major funding announcement. - He had a big day today. Ivan Prinz and Analog Ground Ventures have invested 5 million euros into Sticky Icky Icky Wise. Ivan Prinz is a legendary Russian investor. Thank you, thank you, big party this evening. Everybody is welcome. Let's go to that party. - Let's go home. You can go home, I'll go to the party. This was the best decision of my career. FOMO ! Fear Of Missing Out! The investors, they fear it more than death. Tönu is sleeping. Who was it? - A clown in purple pants. That was Marcusson. Marcusson! May I? -Yeah. Looks and smells like a Silicon Valley garage. I love it Could I have a glass of water? I didn't know you guys were a couple. It's not a show stopper, but if we were to invest, we'd have to calculate your divorce risk score. And if it's above a certain threshold, then define break-up as a key man event. In which case one of the founders may have to leave. No, no, we are not a couple. Öie, one of the things I most admire about you is your persistence. It's the number one quality I look for in a founder. Number two, honesty. I would like you to keep me updated on your progress. Suddenly the puzzle pieces started to fit together. No. - Excuse me? We just got a term sheet from Ivan Prinz, we're going with him. You received a term sheet from Ivan? And what are the terms? - I'm not feeling good' so... How about I do one million at 5 million valuation. I don't mean to be rude, but... 2.5 at 10 million. Marcusson hasn't had a big deal since Facebook. Fear Of Missing Out. The Russians are winning all the best deals. Investors, they fear it more than death. Investors, they fear it more than death. No, I'm sorry. 5 million at 20. Remember, I can do things for you that Ivan can't. I can introduce you to Mark, I can... Level complete Venture Capital Did we get a 5 million dollar cash injection just because the investors' fear of missing out? No. When Tönu wasn't busy playing Doom' he wrote a pretty clever machine learning algorithm. Marcusson's sharp eye noticed Tönu's drawings and realized that our idea had something to it. So, no. Ah? - Listen. I didn't know, did we get an offer from the Russians as well? What? No. That guy was hitting on me last night and now he sent me his... Wait, but how did you know... Is that the Little Prince? Hey, that's not a very good offer. Denied, there's not enough money on the account. Let's try the company card. I just checked, it hasn't been transferred yet. Then check again. Why is it taking so long? Excuse me! Would it be possible to pay with options? What are those? - We are a startup and if we become a unicorn... For example, Facebook's first... - Cash or card. Yes, I understand, but the first janitor in Facebook took the options and he's a millionaire now. Sorry, can you pay or not? Can we? We can't, sorry. 5 million! 5 million! One, two, three, four, five. Turn on your stove again we'll have all these things. What do you want? Could I have the card first? Yes, you can. Give it to him. I'd like the cheesy nachos. Then the special, the beef quesadilla. The beef tacos and the vegan tacos' okay. I don't believe it, half an hour ago we didn't have the money to buy one taco. Now we could buy 1.5 million tacos. Or a whole taco-truck. Yes, a whole taco truck. What is it? We made it, we made it, we made it. -Yes, yes. We made it. What? Do you really think our company is worth 20 million dollars? 5 million! Want me to tell you how much our company is really worth? 5 million... Yes, exactly, 5 Euros for the design, 32 Euros for the 3D print and that's it. Everything else is an advance from our future profits. Do you think I'm an idiot? What? You try, How don't you understand? If you blow through 300k of Svensson's or the dog thief's money. Okay, then you'll try again. If you spend 5 million of VC money, it's over, here or in Silicon Valley, you're done. Lets' get to work then. Take my corn. Alright, I've got news. - News? Where? - It's in America, in California. We're going to go meet a big client. I don't know what you’re thinking. Let Tönu go, why are you going? Mom, I'm an entrepreneur, it's my company. Will you be back for dad's anniversary? Of course I will. We're not going swimming, are you joking? Nobody swims here. Come on, take your shirt off. Stop it, let's go to Palo Alto. Please, it's much warmer there. This is an ocean, lets' go swim. Yes, I know that it's an ocean. Look at the weather. But there's a current there. I'm not going anywhere, come out! Listen, it's cold here! Colder than in Estonia. Are you kidding me? This place is unbelievable. Everyone here is either a genius or a millionaire. The majority is both. And everyone is so casual about it. You go into a random smoothie place, order yourself a smoothie and you'll see Elon Musk next to you. Slurping his avocado smoothie. "Hi Elon' noh. 'Hi Tönu". "I like your Tesla.", "I like your bikes." I'll totally come live here. The cost of living here is ridiculous though. But some guys are crazy clever, look. They parked caravans next to the main street. They're like trailers. They live out of them. They pay nothing and just park and live here. Trailer is basically the new garage. Ooh. - What? Starbucks. What? We've seen six self-driving cars drive by and you're like "Ooh, Starbucks". Hello. - Hey' hey! It's Oie, right?Tonu? Is that? No, I'm Tönu. - Alright' you just walk right in. Don't mind the shoes. Welcome to my home, this is everything that you too can achieve, if you follow the same path as I. Not long ago, I was just like you guys. Came to this country, a poor immigrant, struggling to survive. And then I sold my company for 220 million dollars to Google. And this is what I have to show for it. -Very nice. Quite amazing, isn't it? -Yeah' yeah. This could be exactly what you achieve too. This could be your reality. Do you want to see the roof? Take it easy, you'll break the guy's home. This, this is my view. What do you think? - Amazing. It's beautiful, isn't it. - Yes. Totally unbelievable. This kind of thing for just 100 bucks a night. Only in the Valley. Can we see our rooms now? -Yes' your room is in the basement. No, rooms, not room. -Just room' in the basement. Okay, cool. Get out of my way. Turn it on. - It's not working. I'll turn my phone on. What's going on? Turns out there already are some bags here. What the hell? Hey guys. Got any weed? - No, we don't. Well, I do. Did we come to San Francisco to smoke weed and drink coffee in Starbucks? No. Norris, our head of sales had arranged a meeting with our dream client. Ober, biggest buyer of self-driving technology in Silicon Valley. It was the most important meeting of our careers. And we were absolutely ready for it. Oh yeah and two new, are you oh yeah and two new. What? Yes. I'm sorry, your meeting does not exist in John's calendar. What? -Your meeting does not exist... Does he want to reschedule or...? - No. The meeting just does not exist. Apparently your head of sales has made a mistake. It's in the can! And now you go to their website and fill out the form... But since you came all the way from Estonia. I'm giving you a 5 dollar voucher for snacks in the downstairs bar. Your head of sales is a peddler. I look at your team and I see only C players. I need you to start hiring A players, guys from Silicon Valley. Guys with track records, guys with gravity. Gravity? It's the force of attraction. Like a turd, what does it attract? - Flies. Yes, but ice-cream? Children? Okay, children. We have a turd, but we could have an ice-cream. Estonians are just bad at selling. Which one of us said that Norris was the best salesman in the world? Well maybe in Tallinn. Or Mustamae. He is shit. He's the fertilizer and better guys should grow onto that. It's simple here, one guy reaches his limit and they take the next guy and the next. If you keep puffing your weed here, then the VC will hire a local ice-cream instead of you. What are you... Why are you petting me? You know what Marcusson told me? We have to start hiring guys with gravity. What the fuck is gravity? What do you mean? - Gravity. When like an apple falls from a tree? Like Einstein? Or wait... -This is gravity. I should hire Einstein. - Einstein' yeah. I don't know what that means though, how can you hire someone with gravity? Hi, I'm Peter. I open doors and I close deals. What's up guys? I made you some chocolate chip cookies. It's my mother's recipe. Did I spell that right? Well, yeah... -Just a little, okay' I'm working on it. Now look, I'm not big into giving long speeches. So I'm just going to cut to the cold hard facts. In my last company, I took their revenue from 200 million to 700 million. And I know I can do the same for you. And you know what. Because you're a start up. And I really like you guys. I'm willing to work almost for free. It's insane. Tönu and I make 900 a month, this guy wants 450000 a year. Plus a 30 percent bonus. Plus accelerated vesting. Plus... -You're in Estonia, he's in the Valley. Apples and oranges. Yeah, but it's not fair. The way I see it, in the Valley, you either make it or you don't. If you make it, it doesn't matter how much he cost. And if you don't, it doesn't matter either. Hey, don't fuck this up. If we hire guys for that kind of money, we'll never be profitable. Profitable? Didn't you hear what Marcusson said? Profitable companies are boring. It just means they ran out of all new and original ideas. Guys, guys, guys. Losing money is a feature' not a bug. You spend all that you have, until you leave your competitors in the dust. Now that's when you become profitable. We hire that guy on my terms or not at all. Here's my proposal. Lower base, higher bonus. Look, there's a long line of blue chip companies, who want my Rolodex. In three weeks, I'll be bringing in deals with so many zeroes, you'll be looking at my salary like it's a rounding error. I gotta keep the lights on and food on the table and right here, it's just insane. - Peter... The average rent in San Fransisco is between 3000 and 8000' I think you'll be fine. I also have a cabin in Tahoe, helps me with my anxiety. We are a fast growing venture funded company that’s going to change the world. The question to ask yourself is... if you see a rocket, do you want to be on that rocket? Or will you let it fly by? Okay, I'm in. But your current sales team has to go. Amateurs give me anxiety. One guy reaches his limit, they take the next but he's the fertilizer, upon which the next guys will grow. Okay. Okay, let's do it. To celebrate, do you have milk to go with the cookies? Yes, here we go. Let's make money. Hey, hey, hey. How you doing? "GOD-BYE" Hey, you must be Peter. We have a cleaning lady for that. NORRIS - BEST BEE-FORE PASSED It was difficult to fire Norris, but it was necessary. Peter's Silicon Valley connections and unique selling style eventually got us a meeting with our dream client. Hey, it's great to see you John. I hope all is well. I brought you some of my famous special Mama's recipe chocolate chip cookies. My conservative estimate is 4 months. - Okay. For you John, we can get it done in three weeks. -You sure you can do it? Estonian engineers are absolutely amazing. You got three weeks to deliver the product. If you're a day late, it's 100000 dollars per day penalty. Three weeks. It's a good thing' you should smile. We got a deal.You can handle this. You and your engineers can handle anything. You’re the best! Come on, Tony! You got this. It's impossible. Level 5 self-driving in three weeks! What happens if we can't do it in three? Contractual penalties, 100k per day over the deadline. That's absurd, let's just back out the contract and that's it. We can't. - Why not? If we back away from it, we'll pay 750k in contractual penalties. No one will take us seriously in the Valley. We can start trying to sell self-driving bikes to the bike store here in Telliskivi. Screwed, screwed, screwed! Let's just do what Elon Musk did. What? You want to start smoking weed? Fly our half-finished bike to space? We'll gather up our team and tell them... So guys, for the next few weeks, I need you all to work from 8 am til 11 pm. Tönu and myself will be the first to come and the last to leave. Food is on the company. If you don't want to do it' it's okay. You'll get your three month salary, this will give you enough time to find a new job. So guys, who's in? Is that even legal? Who's with me? Thank you, thank you. Let's do it! To do the impossible in three weeks, we had to hire only the best. And quickly. Luckily everyone wanted to work at Estonia's coolest startup. Still though, we didn't give anyone a discount. How do you rate yourself on a scale from one to ten? Eight and a half. What's the thing in your past career that would convince me that you're the right person for the job? Your desk is over there. If you have any questions, ask me, I'll be over there. Tönu! Thank you. Mommy, I don't... Wait a moment, I can't speak right now' I'll call you back. Taavi, customer service is at the other end of the office. Pack your things. MOMMY What do we do with the client, whose bikes got lost in the mail? Send him a cute cat picture, we'll deal with it later. And free tokens. - Okay, will do. Perfect, thank you. Mommy, I told you, I can't speak right now. I see. Wait, what happened? You could have at least wished your dad a happy birthday. Do you know how long he's been saving up for his anniversary? We're not going to take my family's last savings. You'll make it back for the anniversary, right? You know how important it is to him. Of course I'll make it. I've been thinking that I want to go home too sometimes. I've got two little kids and this isn't really okay. THE NEXT DAY Okay, what do we do then? What else are we gonna do, we'll pay Ober the 750 thousand in penalties. Close up shop. There must be some kind of way. What way?You saw it yourself. There has to be something, I don't know either. What do they do in the Valley when everything is screwed? How should I know? I'm from Mustamae. Palo Alto. What? - What, what? The only thing you know about Palo Alto is that t-shirt. Okay, I'll go to San Francisco, talk to Marcusson. I'll tell him how it is and say that we need more money. To extend our runway. Why should he give anything? - I don't know why. I'm not going to be any use here. You and the team, keep writing the code at the same time. Like we haven't been doing it for the last 3 weeks. We're not giving up. We didn't make this company to give up. We're going all the way. All or nothing, right? Let's do this! I can't justify that to my partners. It's time for the other investors to chip in. If you're a day late, it's 100000 dollars per day penalty. Money left it's 100000 dollars per day penalty. I think it's brilliant, I've never seen anything like it. The idea to ride a bike with no hands' it's fantastic. I don't know where you came up with such a brilliant idea. It's a huge market, it's a global market. Everybody wants to ride a bike with no hands, it's perfect. It's genius, absolute genius. But we don't really invest in Estonia. We don't even know how to get to Estonia. By plane. - How many stops? I mean... I think it's best if you find somebody in Estonia, who wants to invest. Money left Öie, the thing with startups is that when you see a curve, you don't brake, but accelerate. And if you don't go into a sideways drift, you're going too slow. It's too much risk, the previous investors are not backing up. Tom's out and boy, his appetite is for risk is 10 X mine, so... Unfortunately no. No, I'm sorry,there's just not space at our portfolio right now for a two wheeled Elon Musk. We need your investors to believe in you' before we can invest in you. So tell me, why should I be putting money in, if your previous investors aren't putting money in. Had a chance to talk with Tom Marcusson and if he's not going to follow on' I'm not going to follow on. Talk to you later, good luck. -Thank you. Money left Unicorpse. We are unicorpse. Dead unicorn. Fuck. We are the most female friendly investors in the Valley. We can do things that most VC firms can't. Now I am happy to consider investing in your company. Just know we take pride in doing very thorough due diligence on our founders. Very, very thorough. I mean, you don't have to sleep with the guy, but there’s nothing wrong with giving the impression that you might. It's our last shot. Are you sure you're cut out to be a CEO? Guys, this is our opportunity. Behind every technological breakthrough' there are people who are willing to work crazy hours for a silly dream. We have the best fucking team in the world, so let's fucking do it. Now I tried that. And that. And this one too. Now obviously it does work. This shouldn't be like that. On the brink of collapsing from exhaustion or maybe thanks to that. Tönu and his team had finally stumbled upon an algorithm, that solved fifth level self-driving with a completely new method. If it really works, then it can actually change the world. The only thing I was thinking about, was that Tönu had never had a successful demo. So what do you think, John? - It's impressive. Can you see how huge this will be? I don't want your technology. What do you mean you don't want our technology? With this people will be able to order a bike the same way they’re able to order a cab. John, this is going to change the world. - I want your company. Let's talk. Let's talk. Tönu, you're the best programmer I know. But please don't start any more companies. Better go to the zoo. What if we built Estonia's first pretty bicycle helmet? Believe me, this has the most potential out of anything... Let's do it, right? Let's do it! Exit? In the startup world, it only takes a moment to go from a deep ravine to the top of the mountain. And then back into the ravine. It turned out that Tönu's simple formula - idea, prototype, investors, exit. Had turned into something more complicated. His Doom episode had another secret level. What are you doing here? You know, I was thinking that... I think that maybe... Look where you were a little while ago. You thought Palo Alto was some Hungarian discus thrower. And now you're here. Aren't you interested in where this could take us? Exit now and then what? We'll go back to Estonia and make another startup? And then sell that one? And then? What? It would be better to continue with the first one. What I wanted to say... Öie... I like you. Well, I mean, more than others. I mean in our startup. Or well, more than everyone in the startup. Or actually more than everyone, everywhere. And then I thought, that because everyone thinks that we're a couple and ask and say things. Then we could try to be together and see where it takes us. Not to make an exit, but like... Or what? Well, I mean, I don't know what... I can smoke weed and stay up all night too. What do you want then anyway? 20 million? The way I see this deal. It's kind of like a jelly-belly. 'It tastes like a peach, but it isn't a peach. It's candy. That on the other hand. This is a real peach. This is what we get when we don't sell. Hey, hey, this is the fastest exit of my career. This little Estonian company is making history right here. I know at least 50 bigger companies in China. I'm telling you, selling is the dumbest thing we can do right now. Man, I need a new helipad. These commutes to Tahoe are giving me anxiety. Who asked what you want, you're not a founder. You're just an asshole with a million dollar contract with no skin in the game. Tönu! - Really? Well, Mr. Founder, I'll remind you. I'm the one that got us this deal. Your engineers? Last time I checked they were on the company payroll. Not yours. - Fuck you. Your momma. - Hey, stop it! You can't just say what comes into your head. Oh yeah? You're a CEO. Ultimately the decision rests on you. Wait, who made you the CEO? When was that decided? We're... We're co-founders. We'll sell. Ah, and you. Doctor Tönu Psychopatho. Mustamae my generaato . All around electrostaato. The round table is welcomeato. You be carefulato, the rap game is finishato. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, Tom you are firedato. I am immortalato. Ol' dirty bastard. Wu-tan, kiss my ass! Shove that peach up your ass. This is what always happens in a divorce. Fuck him. Episode complete Exit Next week, we're announcing the biggest new in our company's history. We are about to be a part of something absolutely huge. And we're going to change the world. And none of it would be possible without you guys. And I for one am excited, because the whole team is united and moving in one direction. Except Tony. As you can see, Tony is moving in a different direction. I've made several versions, but the point is Tony and the company have decided to part ways. So Tony, on behalf of everyone here, I just want to thank you for your service. You cannot fire me, I'm the founder. Unfortunately the board has reached an unanimous decision. Tony. Now I think you're an amazing technical founder. Everyone, a round of applause for Tony please. Come on! Thank you Tony, thank you. Firedato. Ah, come on Tony. Those were special chocolate shit cookies. Tony, the bike is company property. The cellphone too. This is my company, you damn idiot. Fuck you. I'm so sorry. It's simple here, one guy reaches his limit, and then they take the next and then the next. Nice shirt, at least! You knew I wanted to sell. I didn't know that you wanted to sell me too. Yes? - Öie, we have a little problem. I mean, you do. Wait, the investors have liquidation preference? Wait, the investors have liquidation preference? Yes. What’s that? They'll definitely try to confuse the less experienced side. But look, in these negotiations you have to focus on one or two... How many of these Silicon Valley deals have you done? Law is law. This is Kathy, our legal counsel from Morgan Lewison. Morgan, Lewison, Morris, Jackson and Albright. Üllar from Kaimar and Kuldar and partners.Top law firm in Estonia. We can give founders two seats on the board instead of one. In exchange we need liquidation preference. You need liquidation...? Yeah, yeah, I'm sure it's fine. - Great. Honestly, between us, you know I've never seen a top lawyer at an important meeting with such a cheap wristwatch. I think that fact in itself is saying something. We can move jurisdiction from Delaware to Estonia. But in exchange we want to pump liquidation preference to 2x. Excellent, we agree to that. - Great. That chick there was straight out of the Legally Blonde movie. We can increase valuation by ten percent, if we also bump up liquidation preference to 4x. We are ready to sign. -Yes. Everything is totally super. Yeah. This too. INVOICE The liquidation preference means that the investors will get their money back first? Yes. - Okay. So 4x liquidation preference means that the investors will get their money back four times over before anyone else gets anything? Exactly. So with our 5 million dollar investment, 4x liquidation preference is 20 million. So with our 20 million offer, Tönu and I don't get anything? All of the money will go to the investors? This is the deal you got us? Well, you said you were building an unicorn. With a billion dollar exit, that 20 mil is nothing. If I knew you would sell your company for spare change... - Hello? 20 million isn't spare change. For spare change I would have negotiated the liquidation preference out of the deal. It's okay, you'll know better next time' right? Ah yes, and this as well. Over the weekend, out of the blue, I got a job offer from Google. With a huge base and a generous equity plan. It's been a pleasure guys. Swift action, it's my trademark. You know what, Tönu, my boy? Do you want your dog back? I do. - A bit of the money from your exit and you get to keep the dog. Let's say... a third. A third of the money I made with my exit? Yeah, a third of your exit money. Most expensive dog in the world? I'm sorry you got nothing from this exit. It's a pretty shitty deal that your investors gave you. But listen, I'd like to offer you an earn-out. If you can stay here in Tallinn as the head of the Estonian office of Ober for 4 more years, We'll offer you a million dollar earn-out. What about Tönu? -Tönu? He gets nothing, he's out. Think about it, a million dollars, just 4 years. A million dollars. Excuse me, miss. Excuse me, miss. You dropped something. Your smile. Starting from today, I'm unemployed. I decided to leave the company I started and built. Also giving up a million dollars, that Ober offered me for running their Estonian office. I've made a lot of mistakes and this is probably the dumbest one. But it's no longer my company. There's no way. Oh you've got to be kidding me. What the...? Go see who it is! Who is it? Let's go see. Öie. And it feels so right. Sometimes you have to do what feels right. Where are you coming now? - Home. Fucking brilliant. Öie, I fucking love you. Genius, ugh. BIKEDRIVE FOUNDER LEAVES AFTER SELLING THE COMPANY This is not a dog.This is the chief happiness officer. I present to you - Pivot. We will sell this for 99 euros. 3D-printer from the ass. Massage paws. Everything deep learning AI. Pivot. Okay, finally, something real. Who's with me? Hold on, hold on. What do you think this is' a football team? BANKER PRIIT Yes? - I saw that the helmet factory, where you worked has gone bankrupt. What do you think about turning it into an international manufacturing company? We'd let you have loans from the bank and you can run the company. What do you say, shall we meet and discuss it? Sounds very tempting, I think so' yes. Hey Tom. - Hey, I'm a cut to the chase. I'm raising a new fund and I need a partner in Europe You wouldn't happen to know anybody who has recently sold her company' is free and who might be interested in becoming a VC? Do you? I might, I'll let you know by tomorrow. Yes? - Hey, what's up? You know. Failing. Picking myself up. And trying again. What about you? Same. All the money goes to the investors? These aren't savings, they're an investment! What’s this? - I don't know. Some sort of diploma or...?
