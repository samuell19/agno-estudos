My father planted that tree on the day I was born, eighty-eight years ago. It's beautiful. When I was a boy, people would say my mother had a green thumb. Our garden was quite the show place. Look at it now. I hired a fellow once to clean it up. This was a couple of years ago. Nice young man. Ethan something, I think. What happened to him? I don't know. He worked for a few weeks and then stopped coming. Never saw him again. Listen to me! - I sound like some silly old man. - No! And today is our anniversary. - What? - Yes. Four months ago today, the agency sent you to my door, my new caretaker, companion, and friend. And friend. Come on. It's time to take your medication. They're gonna schedule the last round of interviews in a couple weeks. Couple of weeks? It's a big company. Gotta jump through a lot of hoops. But... that kind of job, you know, they have their own way of doing things. - I can't really push them. - No, I know, I'm just... I'm a little stressed right now. You got another call from the student loan people today. God, they never quit. Well, you stopped taking classes so we have to start paying off the loans. Otherwise, they'll turn it over to a collection agency. - I know, yeah, I'm gonna call tomorrow. - Great. And maybe you can call the credit card people while you're at it too. And the rep with our health insurance. Okay, Katie, I get it. I'll figure something out, all right? Don't worry. I'm gonna get started on the dishes. - Katie. - Don't tell me not to worry. I'm sorry. We're in serious trouble, Adam. - We need to get some money coming in soon. - I'll find something. You've been saying that for months. It doesn't do us any good for me to take some minimum wage job. That's why I quit school, so that I can find something that pays enough. We can start chipping away at our debt. I just need a little bit more time. We don't have any more time, Adam. - Here, let me help you. - No, it's fine. I've got it. I've got it, Adam. Adam! I'll clean it up. Why don't you ever listen to me? Why did you go in there? I begged you, Adam. He could have killed you. I could have lost you. Can you imagine how that would have felt? Never... holding you again, never hearing your voice. Nothing's right anymore. Babe, it's been four months. No. No, I'm sorry. It's... No. Where are you going? Out. Who's there? Leonard. Oh, it's you. Katie. - What are you doing out here? - I thought you were asleep. I just... came here to think. What are you doing with that? I thought I heard someone in the house again. - Again? - I hear them walking and when I come down, they're always gone. There's no one in the house. Here. Are you all right? Why didn't you tell me you had troubles with money? Oh, it's... not your problem. - How much do you need? - Leonard, no. We're friends, aren't we? We are. Well, then let me help you. - I've got a little money set aside. - I could never do that. A young couple starting out. The world is complicated enough. You shouldn't have to worry about money. It comes with the territory. But to be in love, maybe have a family one day, grow old together. These are wonderful things. Things I wanted when I was a young man. And it would be nice to think, that in some small way, I made a difference to someone. Maybe to you and your young man. He needs a job. I'll tell Leonard you're here. It'll be fine. Just talk to him. Okay. Lorazepam, point five milligrams. Yes. I can pick it up after five probably... Local tycoons who built it... Thank you. Bye. ...so they could get their family away from the smell of the stock yards. But their children grew up and... - Hi, how are you doing? - Hi. So sorry to bother you. My name is Mickey Hayden. Real estate agent. Believe me, I know how this is gonna sound, okay, but I have this new client, just got transferred to the city for work. He's got a big family, couple of dogs, the whole nine yards. It's adorable. Anyway, he's looking for just the right home. And yesterday, he was driving through the neighborhood here, took one look at this amazing house... Oh, this house isn't for sale. Are you the owner? No, but, trust me, you'd be wasting your time. He's lived here his entire life. He's not going anywhere. My client is seriously motivated. Yeah, I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. But good luck. Oh, wait. Look... could you do me a favor, Ms... Katie. Katie. If by some crazy chance he happens to change his mind, could you have him call me? That's not gonna happen, but sure. I appreciate that, thank you. Yeah. You have a great day. You too. - They want to make an offer? - Sounds like it. They don't even care what the yard looks like? I'm sure it'll look better after you start work on it tomorrow. Place must be worth a fortune. Mm-hmm. Must be nice. Leonard? There you are. I've got your breakfast. - Thank you, Katie. - Of course. My parents used to play this. It's lovely. Sit with me a moment. Sure. Did you lock the back door? - Yep. - Good. So, when do I get the grand tour and see how the other half lives? The time will come. What about that Buick? Looks like it's been parked there for a while. - Does Leonard even drive it anymore? - No, not since I've known him. I don't think he's driven it in years. I was reading online about this medical school with a really great program in pediatric surgery. I could send you the link. I love you. I love you too. - Mr. Calvern. - Hello Katie, how are you today? I'm fine, thank you. We weren't expecting you. Oh, is... Is this a good time? Sure, yeah. Come in. Leonard, Mr. Calvern is here from the agency. Good morning, Mr. Wellsley. Mr. Calvern, how nice to see you again. Come to check up on us? No. Not at all. I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd drop in, say hello. I thought we might have a chat. Yeah. I'll get lunch started. Just call me if you need anything. - Thank you, Katie. - Yeah. - Come back here. - Oh, great. This is my favorite room. - What's for lunch? - Adam! - You're all jumpy in the big scary house? - You can't be in here. There's a guy from the agency, and he's doing a drop-in. Oh. Well, you're doing a great job. Yeah, and he sees my husband working here. That won't look a little funny? Oh, you mean like maybe we're just... messing around? I don't know... Stop it. - Come on. - Okay. But I'm hungry. - So, how is everything? - Love you. Well... that's a question that people ask all the time to people of my age. Well, Mr. Wellsley seems in good spirits. You two have gotten very close. Yeah, he's an interesting man. I like talking to him. You hired a gardener? Part-time, yeah. It was Leonard's idea. Okay. Well, I'll see you soon, Katie. Yeah. I can't say I especially care for our Mr. Calvern. - Why not? - He keeps asking all these questions, like he's trying to trip me up to make you look bad. He's just making sure I'm taking good care of you. That's all. Well, don't you worry. I told him I couldn't get along without you. Speaking of which... Thank you. Adam? Look. Look. Whoa. Did you get a raise? Oh, no. What? I said something to Leonard... about us. What do you mean? I told him we're broke. Christ, Katie. - It's a little personal, don't you think? - I was upset. You were being a jerk, and I needed to talk to somebody. - When was I being a jerk? - That's not the point. Leonard wanted to help, so he offered to give us money. And you said yes? No, I asked him to give you a job instead. Well, maybe this check is for both of us. Like he added an extra zero. It's too much. What are you doing? I'm calling him. We can't keep this. He has to write us another check. By the time we drive back to the house and he writes another check, the bank will be closed. If we don't pay these bills by today, Katie, they'll be kicking in our door. He's not answering. All right, look, why don't we... deposit the check... - We cannot take this money. - It's just for tonight. Pay the bills. Talk to Leonard in the morning. You can write him a check for the difference. It's one night, Katie. What's Leonard's deal, anyway? What's he doing in that big house all by himself? His parents passed away like... thirty years ago. He's an only child. Never married. No other family? No. It must be tough... just being all alone like that. Yeah. He's such a good guy. Yeah. - Love you. - I love you too. Leonard? Leonard? Leonard? I'm sorry. What was he doing up here in the attic? He liked to come up here sometimes. Listen to old records. What would he need to keep locked up here? Adam. We shouldn't. I'm just gonna look. Katie. Come look. Who's she? I don't know. All these letters. Didn't you say that Leonard never married? We shouldn't do this. All right. Let's go. We need to call 911. Holy! What? That's a lot of money. You said he lived alone here for how many years? People get a little eccentric. Start by putting some aside, little by little, and before you know it... He doesn't have any family. It'll end up in a police locker somewhere. Government'll take it. Why should we let it get caught up in the system like that? When it could actually do some real good. I mean, you said yourself how much he cared about you. He wanted to help. He did. Well, there you have it. A way for him to help you. Help us. We would have to be careful. Yeah. We will. Adam. - Yeah. - Promise me. I promise. So how long did you work for Mr. Wellsley? About four and a half months. And you lived here too? Leonard stayed here alone at night. That's how he wanted it. He could still get around okay. When was the last time you saw him? Yesterday afternoon. We left a little early to go to the bank around... Around 4:30. And you worked here too, Mr. Kettner? Just a couple weeks. I was doing some yard work for Leonard. We're married. I kind of got that. Yeah. So how was Mr. Wellsley doing? Was he having any health issues recently? No. He's been fine. I mean... he's 88, so he took a lot of medication but... but he wouldn't have complained about it anyway. He wasn't like that. Well, I'm gonna need to get some contact information, next of kin. He doesn't have any family. No? No. I'm sorry for your loss. If you have any questions... just give me a call. Leonard once told me he wanted to be cremated. He wanted his ashes spread in the garden. Let me get back to you. Okay. Thank you. Where are you going? I have to talk to Mr. Calvern to get my name back on the list. What list? At the agency. For another position. Why? Because that's what I should do, now that I don't have a job. If you don't hear back about that job soon, maybe you should start looking again too. All right. I will. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Katie, I am so sorry. The two of you were so close. I can't imagine what a shock it was. If there's anything I can do... I would like to get another assignment as soon as possible. - Oh, okay. Well, let's talk in my office. - Okay. UNKNOWN Hello? Speaking. Oh! Hi, yeah. I agree. I thought the interview went very... I see. Yeah, no, I completely understand. Thank you for calling. Yeah, you too. Katie, I assumed you knew. I can't put you back to work, not until the police finish their investigation. Investigation? Well, yes, when a client expires under the supervision of an employee, we cooperate with the authorities to be absolutely certain that there was... you know, how would it look to a potential client that there was even any hint of... Wait, you think I had something to do with what happened to Leonard? God, no. No, of course not. No. This is... I'm sorry, Katie. This is company policy. There's nothing I can do until the police officially close their investigation. So, how long is this gonna take? Yeah, I... I wish I knew. Hello? Hey. What were you thinking? You can't just come in here like this, like we still belong here. Excuse me. I'm bleeding right now. What do you want from me? We said we'd be careful, Adam! I asked you and you promised me. - You promised. - All right. Okay! Look, I... I'm sorry. But if I wasn't here, I think that money would be gone. How could anyone know about the money? - It's Leonard's. He kept it hidden. - Why else would they be here, Katie? You didn't see who it was? No, they came up behind me. They couldn't have known you were here. They wouldn't have busted in like that. I heard the glass break. That's why I came down. The back door was already open. And you didn't think maybe that was a bad sign, that you should get out? No, I didn't have time to think. The next thing I know, I was waking up to the sound of my phone ringing. How could you do this, Adam? This never should have happened. You never should have been here. - That's not the point! - Then what's the point? - Almost a hundred grand! That's the point. - You're always trying to justify your... You counted it? I counted to 92,000, and there was more. Then she calls me to say how sorry she is that the hiring committee decided to go another way. Whatever the hell that means. I don't even know... They're all just such assholes. I'm just sick of being poor. Who was it, Adam? Who got in here? Maybe somebody who did some work on the house? - Sometime before you started. - Leonard talked about hiring a gardener, but that was a couple of years ago. Well, whoever it was, I don't think it was a coincidence. They must have known that Leonard had passed away. And figured the house would be empty. Yeah. But maybe you're right. Maybe they didn't know about the money. They probably just wanted to get in and get out. Just grab whatever they can get away with. What if they come back? All right, right this way. There you go. Just ring when you're ready. Thank you. Babe. Dinner's on me. All right. ♪ Temptation got me ♪ ♪ I cannot resist that feeling ♪ ♪ You make me want it ♪ ♪ Feels like all I ever needed ♪ ♪ Temptation got me ♪ ♪ I cannot resist that feeling ♪ ♪ You make me want it ♪ ♪ Feels like all I ever needed ♪ - Morning. - Morning. I was just making you coffee. Ms. Franklin, this is Detective Chesler. We spoke at Mr. Wellsley's house. Would you give me a call when you get this message? You have the number. Thanks. Sorry to keep you waiting. Thanks for coming in. Detective. Is there a problem? Why don't we talk back here? Did Mr. Wellsley ever mention a will? No. And no family? He was all alone. Well, something like this, the rich old man, living alone, no heirs. We just have to cross all of our t's. I'm sorry, Detective. I don't... What is this about? Well, you said that Mr. Wellsley asked to be cremated. So I'm assuming that you want to honor his request. Yes. Yes, we do. Without a family and no will, the question becomes who bears the cost of the arrangements. We'll take care of Leonard. Okay. I've got the paperwork right here. What's that? His favorite tea. Thanks. For Leonard. Leonard. We should put the money back. It doesn't feel right. Let's just be here. For Leonard. We should say something. "And he shall be like a tree, planted by the rivers of water. That bringeth forth his fruit in his season and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper." I'm sorry. Who are you? Apologies, Ms. Franklin. My name is Julia Byron-Kim. I'm Mr. Wellsley's attorney. Ms. Byron-Kim, Leonard never said anything about an attorney. Please, call me Julia. And I'm not surprised. What do you mean? The first I heard from Mr. Wellsley was only a few weeks ago. He called me out of the blue, wanting me to write up his will, and asked me to come to the house. - I never saw you here. - He was very specific about that. I was to only come in the evenings. Why? He left everything to you. - Oh, my God! - Congratulations. Oh, my God! I don't even know what to say. This is... Say thank you, Leonard! Wow. Okay, so what happens now? First, I suggest you read over the will very carefully. Better yet, I would have your lawyer take a look. Actually, we don't have a lawyer. Well, Mr. Wellsley did pay my retainer in advance, asked that I help you through this transition. What transition? We can't just move in right away? Of course you can, with the understanding that the will is going through probate, which takes about three months. And if there are any surprises, you should have someone to look after your interests. Now, I understand if you want to find your own lawyer. You said Leonard called you out of the blue. You didn't know him? I never met him before. Why did he call you? He found me on the Internet. He said that he liked my name. Byron was his favorite poet. Ms. Byron-Kim. Sorry, Julia... I'm kind of new at this. I'm not really sure how to go about it officially, but I could really use your help. There are some big changes coming your way. I hope you're ready. Me too. And how about Adam? What about him? Well, he does understand that legally, where it comes to this house, you make all the decisions. We've always decided things together. Which is how it should be. These things, you just never know how it can change someone. We'll be okay. Good. - Leave it to me then. - Great. - Congratulations. - Thanks. We should take a vacation for a month. Just first class all the way. You'll get your MBA before you know it. Find a great job. - That piece of junk that we drive. - We can pay off everything. Credit cards, loans, just wipe the slate clean. You know, we should go right now. Both of us. Just go pick brand new cars. - Come on, Adam. I'm serious. - Yeah, me too. - We can't do that. - Why not? We have the money. We can't just walk in there with all that cash. It'll look weird. - People are gonna ask questions. - Yeah. No. You're right. I did some research online and been looking into that. Into what? See there's ways we can make it work, right? We just spread the money around. Different banks, different kinds of accounts. What are you talking about? If we do this right, it's like nobody will ever know. We can get away with so much in taxes. Adam. We still have to be careful. We have been careful, okay? Don't you think it's time for us to treat ourselves? You earned it. God knows I have. I mean maybe you're right, but we have to settle in first, take things slow, you know. Just... Just a little while longer. Okay? Yeah. Okay. We'll take it slow. I'll call the movers. See how soon we can get them over here. What? We don't need any of this stuff. What? It's our stuff. We've had it since we got married. Yeah well, here, we'll keep the pictures and some of those books, and we don't need the rest of this junk. What are we supposed to do with all of it? Just leave it for the next poor losers that have to live in this dump, right? Jeez, Adam. Hello? Yeah, that was five months ago and I already gave the police my statement. Who was it who called you, sir? I didn't get the name. He just said talk to someone at the front desk. I got nothing. Mr.Kettner, everything okay? He says somebody told him to come down, make a statement. What's this regarding? Like five months ago somebody robbed the Smile Diner, killed somebody. You were at the diner that night? Yes. Lucky you didn't get hurt. I kinda stopped the guy. You did? Yeah, in that situation, I reacted. My wife was working that night so... Ms. Franklin was there too? Yeah, but what I don't understand is you already have the guy locked up. Why do they need another statement? They don't. What are you talking about? That guy from the diner, Ray Gaskin. - Yeah. - He's dead. Somebody stabbed him in his cell a couple weeks ago. So who called me? Kind of wondering that myself. Excuse me? Hello, Katie. Do you remember me? Yeah, what are you doing back here? I know, a pain in the ass, right? But my client, he's driving me nuts. He just... He absolutely loves the place. I think he wants to make an offer. I told you already. It's not for sale. Maybe, if I could speak with the owner myself, at least I can say I tried. Look, I'm really busy and you can't just show up here like this, so... I want you to go now. Please. You know, Katie? This ain't my first rodeo. You know, one of the first lessons in real estate... if you want to find new listings, check the obituaries. Yes, I know all about the late Mr. Wellsley. Sad. The house isn't for sale. You know, I've had my eye on this house for a couple years. The old man... kicks the bucket... and you think you can just move in? I'm gonna smile? Wish you well? I own the house now. What the hell are you saying? Leonard left it to me. I have his will, I can prove it. Yeah, well for five grand I can make a new will that says it belongs to my dear Aunt Myrtle. I have a lawyer. Of course you do. If you have any more questions, I suggest you talk to her but, in the meantime, get the hell off my property before I call the police. All right. Well, I guess I'll see you around, Katie. He's just messing with you. It's not how it sounded. He practically accused me of forging the will. Babe, trust me. The thing this guy cares about is what he's losing on commission. Maybe I should talk to Julia. The lawyer? Why? In case Hayden tries to make trouble? What could he do? I don't know but it's like she said, we don't want any surprises right now. Katie. This guy is just pissed off. Forget about him. Come on. It's our first night in our new house. We should celebrate. Yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you have in mind? I can think of something. - Let me take a shower first. - What? I've been cleaning the house all day. I'll be right out. What is this? My old one stopped working, so... Looks expensive. Well, it's a knock off. Just bought it from some guy downtown. Very convincing. You want company? I'll be right out. Detective! - Looks like I came at a bad time. - No, you're fine. Come in. You folks going somewhere? Yeah, we're moving, actually, into Leonard's house. Leonard? As in Mr. Wellsley? I know. I'm still getting used to the idea myself. Leonard left it to me in his will. Now then, that is a very nice house. Yes, it is. - Congratulations. - Thank you. So, a thing like that, what do they call it? A windfall. Doesn't happen every day. Nope. Funny you forgot to mention it. What? The will, and all, when we spoke. I asked you about his family, about a will. Oh no, I didn't know about it until after the service. His lawyer came by. That must've been quite a shock. Yeah, it was. I'd have loved to see the look on your face. You know, I mean you worked there for... what did you say? Four months? Why are you here, Detective? I was hoping to speak with your husband. He's not here. Well, maybe you can help me. See, I was wondering when you worked nights at that place, the Smile Diner, did he pick you up all the time? I mean, he picked you up before. Yeah. Right, but was it a set thing? Was it every night, was it certain nights? No, not exactly. So how did he happen to be there that night? I... I called him to pick me up and he came early to study. Well, you ought to play the lottery, Katie. You're a very lucky woman. Does this have anything to do with the fact that the police called Adam about making another statement? He didn't tell you? Police never called Adam. No, I was here. They called him down at the station. No, I checked it out after he left. There's no record of any calls to his number. That doesn't make any sense. Why would... Why would anyone... send him down there for no reason? Well, maybe they had a reason. Maybe it's just not the one you think. Take care now. Thanks, Julia. I'll talk to you later, bye. Katie. What did she want? I called her, actually. What did you tell her? Nothing. That's not how it looked. Looked like you guys were best friends all of a sudden. Well, maybe if you'd been here, maybe if you'd answered your phone... We agreed. We decided you were not going to talk to her. No, you decided. Like you've been deciding a lot of things lately. What are you even talking about? Why didn't you tell me that it wasn't the police who called you? It was somebody else who made sure you went down there, right? Who told you that? Detective Chesler dropped by. And she was asking a lot of questions, about you, about what happened the night of the diner. What is that about, Adam? How should I know? Who called? - Who sent you to the police station? - I don't know! My bad, I was gonna tell you about it. It's a whole lot of other stuff has been happening right now. What other stuff? I think I'm being followed. What? I kind of had the feeling before. Today, I just went driving around, just around. I kept seeing the same car. Did you go to the bank? - Come on, we said we would not do that. - No, Adam. No bullshit. Just tell me. Did you go to the bank today? Did you take money out? I noticed him. So I figured, you know, it wouldn't be a good idea. Just in case. In case he was after the money. - We don't know that. - Why else is he watching you? Look, maybe I'm just paranoid. Okay? Maybe there's nobody who's following me. I don't know. You got sent down to the police station, Adam. That way, I'm here alone. That way, Hayden shows up, tries to intimidate me, scare us out of the house. What is that? Why is he here? Because he probably knows. I warned you. Chesler. Hey, Tom. You did? Great. Great, okay. Hold on. All right, so probably just from the last four, five months. We're looking for any checks drawn on an account from a Leonard Wellsley. Yeah, made out to her name. Yeah. It's Kate... Franklin. Listen, can you see what you got on the husband too? It's a different last name. It's an Adam Kettner with a "K." Great, get back to me as soon as you can. Thanks. What are you looking for? Leonard didn't just stash that money. It had to come from somewhere. There has to be a reason. Does that even matter now? Julia said... if they find out we've been hiding something illegal, we could lose everything. All right. So what do you suggest? We just give it all back? I don't know. Yeah, maybe. - To whom, Katie? - I don't know! But this never felt right. I'm not going back to the way things were before. Adam. We may not have a choice. We always have a choice. I had absolutely no idea that Mr. Wellsley left Katie the house. That seems a little... excessive. Doesn't it, though? Yeah. What can you tell me about her husband? I've never met the man. So you had nothing to do with hiring him? As a gardener at the house. No. It's strictly against our policy for family members to work together. Our patients are elderly, infirm. We can't risk that kind of potential distraction. So, do you know of Ms. Franklin ever breaking the rules before? Never, no. No, she absolutely understood the importance of her job, especially... with Mr. Wellsley. Why especially him? Well, you wouldn't have known it to look at him, but his health was very delicate. You know, Katie told me, she kept a notebook, like, a daily log, just to keep track of his medication. Do you happen to have a record of his medications? You'd have to speak with his doctor about that. Right. How about Ms. Franklin's contract, how much she was being paid? Yeah, sure, we can get that to you. - Yeah. - Excellent. Thank you. And let me... just ask you. Did she... Did she ever mention a raise? Good lord. She deposited that check just before Wellsley died. Was she really taking money from that poor old man all along? It's a good question. Adam? Adam! Shit! Ethan? These were never cashed. You okay? I think I know who that is. What? Leonard said something about hiring a gardener. I think I told you about this. A guy named Ethan. This was a couple years ago. So he's been up there for a while. There were checks made out to Ethan Doyle. They were never cashed. Leonard said, one day, he just stopped showing up. Never heard from him again. Somebody shot him. You looked? He must have bled to death up there. He was murdered. Yeah. I think so. But... Leonard couldn't have known he was there. Right? I mean, he would have helped him. And why would Doyle hide out in the shed? Why not... come into the house? Maybe these have something to do with it. Take a guess. Wow. - Do you think they're real? - Why else would he hide them? Shit! Here! Just... - Oh, God! - Oh, my God. Give them here. Come on. - I'm sorry. - Dammit. - Don't answer. - I saw your car. But I can't. My car is parked outside. They know I'm here. - Okay, I'm just gonna... - I got it. Open the door! Do you hear me? Katie! Katie, open the door please! I'm sorry. This really isn't a good time. Well, yeah. I'm sure you're very busy settling into your new home. You should be ashamed of yourself. How could you take advantage of that poor man? - What? - Look, I knew something was up. I could feel it. But you know what? You had him so frightened he couldn't even tell me. It's not... No! I'm not letting you tarnish my company's good name. - Mr. Calvern... - I'll find proof! I'm gonna call the police! - I'm gonna have you arrested! - This really isn't a good time. This isn't over, Katie! I'll be back! I'm gonna find out what's been going on in this house, one way or another! I'm not letting this go! You hear me? I'm not gonna lose my business over this! Why isn't this full? Katie? Hey, Katie! Hey. - Didn't you hear me? - Hi, sorry. I was making tea. You want some? No. I got you a present. A new phone? Yeah. Got one for each of us. New numbers too. I figured the way things were going, we could both use a little privacy. We can't keep them. - Katie... - Adam, no. There is a dead man out there. He was murdered. He stole those diamonds. And who knows what else he may have done, who he may have hurt. These things don't just go away like they never happened. - The police must be looking for him. - Don't you get this? Doyle stole the diamonds, got himself shot, and then he died out there all by himself. It's like... It's like he fell down a well. Two years later, nobody knows what happened to him or the diamonds. We can do whatever we want. - What are you doing? - I'm calling Detective Chesler. - We need to tell her... - No! Wait! Wait, just... Okay, hang on. Just listen to me for just a second. Okay, ask yourself. What the heck was Doyle doing here in the first place? Why take some crappy gardening job if he's planning to steal a fortune in diamonds? I don't know. Some old guy's house digging up weeds is the last place that anybody's gonna come looking for him. I mean, think about it. Why else wouldn't he cash the checks? He didn't want to leave a paper trail. That way he sets up the big score. Nobody knows about this place and he can just hide here for as long as he needs to. Although, I'm sure that getting shot and dying out there - was probably not a part of the plan. - That doesn't change anything. We can't keep those diamonds. All right, so what about the money? What are we gonna do about that? What do you mean? If we do this, then the police put us under a microscope, so how is that going to look? We took the money from here and then we hid it in the bank. What are they gonna think? We'll explain it to them. Tell them it was Leonard's money, that it was his safety net. All right, and then what? 'Cause you heard what the lawyer said. Even if they believe us, even if we don't end up in jail, we could still lose this place. We don't need this house, Adam! We don't need any of this. Okay? As long as we have each other, we're going to be all right. All right? I'm done with all right. That's not enough anymore. I told you. I'm not going back to the way things were before. And what about that man out there? What are we supposed to do about that? Pretend it never happened? I'll take care of it. How? How are you gonna do that? This house belongs to us now. Okay, this is our future. I'm not gonna let anybody take that away from us. Look, everything is gonna be okay. I'll take care of this for you. What are you doing? Someone's in the house. Where did you get that? Adam. - Don't. - Don't move. We need to call 911. Freeze, asshole! Oh, my God. Calvern. Where's the girl? How are you holding up, Katie? Detective Chesler. Hell of a thing. It was an accident. Yeah, that's what they're saying. Either way, law says it's self-defense, so... It still makes you wonder. What was going through his head? Why would he do something like that? Just let himself into the house? I don't know. Something had to set him off. I know none of this is you, Katie. What? Everything was fine around here until Adam started work. So you can tell me whatever is going on. I know that none of it is you. I don't know what you're talking about. I know about your money problems. I know what that does to people. I know about the big check that you deposited from Mr. Wellsley. You don't understand. Okay, don't say anything, Katie. Just... Just listen for a second. Because... could be that... it was a loan, maybe it was a gift, who's to say? But I want you to put yourself in my shoes. The big picture. How all of a sudden, everything just drops in your lap. - I told you... - I mean, here I am, the coroner tells me that the old guy died in his sleep. You tell me what his last wish was. And I figure, sure, why not? But it is not until after he's cremated that you find a will. I didn't find it, I didn't even know about it. And I don't even have a body. I can't even prove that he didn't die a natural death. I mean I gotta tell you, it's starting to keep me up at night. I would never hurt Leonard. I am not talking about you. What? Has Adam ever mentioned anyone by the name of Gaskin, a Ray Gaskin? I know that name. 'Cause he tried to rob the diner that night, and he also worked as a janitor at the university while Adam was taking classes. - No, that's not... No. - Okay. It's a big school. Maybe they never met. But sooner or later... Adam is going to screw up. It's only a matter of time. Don't let him take you down with him. You come to me. Baby. They wanna talk to you. Hell of a thing. - Katie! - Hey. I heard what happened. Are you all right? I've been trying to call you. My number's been changed. I need to talk to you. - Yeah. Come upstairs. - Okay. And this Detective Chesler, do you believe her? Is it possible that Adam had anything to do with what happened at the diner that night? I don't know what to believe. Did Adam have any problems with Mr. Wellsley? - Any issues? - No. No, nothing. If the police suspect that Adam had anything to do with his death, they'll try to find a motive. They're gonna try to claim that he hurried things along. He hated being poor. Okay, listen to me. If Chesler thinks she can make a case, she's not gonna waste any time. She's gonna try to get a warrant and search the house right away. Can she do that? You need to be asking yourself, will she find anything? You need to promise me. Promise me that you'll help Adam too. It's gone. What? The money. Adam must have taken it. That's what you found? Cash? Yeah... Almost $100,000... in the attic. We thought it was stolen at first but... And then what changed your mind? The diamonds. So you found diamonds in the house? In the living space above the garage. Does Adam have these diamonds? Yeah. You need to stop him. What? Why? He knows you suspect something. That's why he took the money. He disappears and throws you to the cops. No, Adam would never do that. Are you sure? You need to find him, bring him to the house and then call me. - You're not coming with me? - I need to hold off Detective Chesler. I don't want her serving the search warrant till we know Adam's in the house. - Detective Chesler. - Detective Johnson. What have we got? Garbage truck was making its rounds this morning, called it in. - How long's he been in there? - ME's still en route. You beat him here. Damn. Why did you call me? There was a backpack next to the vic. Inside we found an old laundry receipt. It's pretty faded, but... the address matches the name from one of your cases. What's the name? Leonard Wellsley. Come on, Adam, pick up. - Where've you been? - Adam! I'm up half the night talking to the cops. I wake up in the morning, you're already gone. There's no note. You haven't answered your phone all day. - Where've you been, Katie? - The bank. That's one of the things I need to talk to you about. - Why did you take the money? - Cause we're in a lot of trouble. Checked up on that real estate agent, Hayden. I mean, what's this guy's deal? Why's he so interested in selling this particular house? Guess what? There's no record of a Mickey Hayden getting a real estate license. - What? - Yeah. He just got released from prison. Did a couple years for robbing a jewelry store. Jewelry? One of those spots downtown. Doesn't even use a gun. He just sweet talks his way through the security door, then he blindsides the armed guard, does some old school, like, smash-and-grab. Sixty seconds, comes out with three million dollars in loose diamonds that were never recovered. - That's why he was here. - Hang on, it gets better. Cops think that he had an accomplice that they never found. You wanna take a wild guess? This other guy gets shot during the burglary, then he gets away. Doyle got away with the diamonds. And... there's only one other person who could've known about it. The one who shot him. Hayden. This bastard didn't bother to use a fake name. What did he think? We weren't smart enough to figure it out? We have to call the police. No, the only thing that we need to do is get the hell out of Dodge. We got plenty of travel money, so... сan you go pack some stuff up real fast? I'm gonna go get cleaned up. You were never gonna leave me. What? No, why would I ever leave you? Get changed. Hi, Julia. It's Katie. Yeah, he's here, but... listen, it wasn't him. Where are they? I don't know. Call him out here. Adam? Adam? Adam! Right here, baby. Let her go. Look, I just want the diamonds. I said let her go. I've been waiting a long time for this. So how about you just tell me where they are? Some place you're never gonna find them. Are you gonna shoot me, kid? That's right. 'Cause if I just give you the diamonds, you'll shoot both of us. Here's the thing though. Even if you hit me from there... my gun's gonna go off, and it's gonna blow a hole in her the size of your head. And we don't want that now, do we? So, let's just talk about this. Adam! Son of a bitch. Adam! No! Adam! Baby... Adam! Baby! Please. Adam. ...in the garden. Stay with me, baby. Katie. Oh, my God. Here, Katie. I'm sorry. Here, sit. Hey. Katie, listen. We need to look for the diamonds before the police get here. Do you understand? It's the only way we can explain what happened without implicating you. - Adam never would have hurt Leonard. - Katie, the diamonds. How could I have ever thought that? It was Hayden. Hayden... killed him with an overdose. He read the logbook, the one I kept for Leonard's medication. I found the empty pill bottle. How do you know it was Hayden? Leonard used to tell me all the time that he could hear someone in the house, but I never... I... It was Hayden. Looking for the diamonds. - He couldn't find them. - But you did? I don't understand. Why did Hayden shoot Doyle? Why didn't... Why didn't he end up with the diamonds? Because he wasn't half as smart as he wanted you to think. I mean how smart do you have to be to decide to rip off your partner, shoot him while the cops are rolling up, and he still gets away with three million dollars in diamonds? Meanwhile, you get busted and spend two years in prison. I never told you how much the diamonds are worth. Oops. - What are you doing? - Look, okay, I paid my dues. Okay, I spent ten years as a public defender. How do you think I got Hayden's case? I knew he was an idiot. But I believed his story. And we had an agreement, an understanding, and, of course, he messes everything up. I plea bargained his charges down to two years. I traced Doyle back to when he worked for Leonard. But the only thing that I couldn't figure out was where he was. Turns out Doyle was dead. You helped kill Leonard? No, I had nothing to do with that, okay? That was all Hayden. He got impatient. He wanted to hurry things along, but I did have to do some fast maneuvering to cover up for him. The will. It isn't real, is it? It's real enough. With no one to contest it, what's the difference? Look, I'm sure Leonard would've given you the house if he was alive, but that is beside the point. Right now, I need you to tell me where the diamonds are. I don't know. Katie. Adam hid them. I really don't know where they are. But I wouldn't tell you if I did. You know, that's what I really liked about you. It was never about the money. But I'm sure they'll turn up. These things always do. - Katie? - Detective! I'm Julia Byron-Kim. I'm Ms. Franklin's attorney. Well, Ms. Byron-Kim, I'm gonna need you to step out so I can see both your hands. If you just give me a minute to explain on behalf of my client. Show me your hands. Right now! All right. - Detective, if you would just listen... - Look out! Stay back. Are you okay? Are you okay? You're okay, sweetie. You're okay. Come on. Come on. Let's get you out of here, come on. This is Detective Chesler. I'm requesting a back-up and an ambulance at 127 Queens. FOUR MONTHS LATER Katie. - Hey. - Detective. Sorry, I tried knocking. Sorry, I was... a million miles away. A young cedar. This is a nice spot. - Lots of sun. - Yeah, I think so. - It's good to see you. - And it's good to see you. You look beautiful. Thank you. Yeah, we're... We're doing well. Well I just came by to let you know that the case is officially closed. Mickey Hayden and Julia Byron-Kim are the only suspects on record. So your baby won't grow up to someday find out her father had a criminal history. Thank you, Detective. We've been through that place a half a dozen times, top to bottom. Still can't figure it out. He didn't tell me. I really don't know where Adam hid the diamonds. I'm sorry, though. I wish I did. Take care of yourself, Katie.
