Thank you for listening "twilight online" tonight. This is Edmond poon. I have recently received lots of phone calls and emails from the audiences, responding about a very scary haunted school in Hong Kong it's called "tak yuk college". Why is "tak yuk college" entitled as a haunted school? I believe that is related to its historical background. Because we all know that this "tak yuk college" was occupied by the imperial Japanese army during world war ii. Lots of people came for the supernatural experience. They mentioned that seeing many imperial Japanese army ghosts are wandering. People who studied in this school said they encountered a lot of unexplainable things. There should've been nobody around. But they always feel like someone is watching them with evil thoughts. They couldn't sleep well in the dorm because they would have sleep paralysis. Besides the imperial Japanese army ghosts are wandering around there is another rumor. Which is about a white dressed ghost appearing in the school. But why is there white dressed ghost? That is an unknown. Okay, let's take a break. Let's pick up the call from the audience. The hotline is 98844989. You can feel it, you cannot put into words. It cannot be spoken, you need to perceive it by yourself. You can feel it, you cannot put into words. It cannot be spoken, you need to perceive it by yourself. What's the matter with you? Wake up. Wake up. Are you okay? You alright? What's wrong? What's happened? Are you okay? - Leave now. - Um. Hopefully we can see some good stuff this time. Hey why is shing li still not coming? He told me that he met a girl online and she is just nearby. What do you guys think? This perve is a complete waste of time. Why do you seem to be in a rush to get inside? There are a lot of strange rumors. Once the sky gets dark, a marching noise emerges from the playground. And some say there is a woman in a white dress, singing songs and fluttering around. If I knew, I wouldn't have come. It's just rumors. There are so many students come to school everyday, how could that happen? You look at her. Look at her. She seems so happy. There must have something inside. Look! You have scared her like this! I can see them. If I see they get close to you, I will shout and pull you away. Don't scare her! Relax, I have studied here and I have never seen anything. Excuse me, excuse me. I got something to do. Hey, you are finally here. I thought your online girlfriend doesn't let you come. Damn it, don't you mention it. Do you know that those photo editor apps really gets people screwed! I saw her in person, this! Bigger than her ass. You are a pervert. Let's go, don't waste our time. All mens are perverts. There is not a shame to be a pervert when you are next to a hot girl. Ain't I hot? Fung, is it locked? I don't know. Hey, hey, don't come near. You can feel it. Hey! Get out! You are so stinky! Get away from me! Stop getting closer. I am going to be violent. You cannot put into words. Get away! It cannot be spoken. Hey, what's wrong with you? You need to perceive it by yourself. You can feel it. The door is opened. Do not come any closer, get out, I am going to punch you! Come inside quickly, come in! I am going to punch you! Go away! You can feel it. You cannot put into words. It cannot be spoken. You need to perceive it by yourself. Psycho, that stinky beggar. He is so dirty and he even put his head near me. Don't you know that your hair stink? I would have beaten him up if you didn't pull me away. He wouldn't be a beggar if he is normal, would he? Anyway, your school is huge. Isn't it? So so. So so? We have already walked for 30 minutes. Don't be so nervous, they have no bad intention. They? Where are they? Over the stone bench. Don't look! They don't like being stared. They've died here a long time ago. But none of them have bad intention, don't be afraid. There were some glorious moments of the school back then. It was one of the most famous schools. Like the old saying, a split second of glory doesn't mean eternity. Now the school is shut down anyway. That's why I'd like to come back and take a look. Perhaps, there is no more chance in the future. Let's go meet the principal. We can stay at the dorm because of his permission. The accommodation policy has been canceled 7 years ago. I am not afraid of filthy. I am just afraid of that thing. That scary thing. Hey, what do you mean by scary thing? Come on, let's go meet the principal. Wow. Very "old school". Let's go, I take you guys up there. The air-conditioner is still dripping? Fung. Uncle. Long time no see. It has been a long time. It's summer holiday, and I came back to memorialize. - Principal. - Um. These two keys are for the dorm, here you go. There is written room number on each key. You take them to canteen and get some food. And I'll wait for you in the study room. Let me briefly introduce our school history to all of you. Okay, principal. - Thanks uncle. - Thanks principal. Fung. Call me principal in the school, not uncle. Yes, I got it. Let's go. Sister kuen. Fung. Finally. Can't wait to meet you here again. How come you become so skinny? Are you not used to foreign food? Nevermind, let me make you some nice food. They are all your friends? Yes. Come, take a seat. - How are you, sister kuen. - Come and sit. Sit down, sit down. Hello, sister kuen. You all are young. Come and take a seat. Yes, sister kuen. Ah? I brought you this drug. I thought I have told you not to waste money to buy me drug. This is home-made drug I didn't buy it, please just accept it. Thank you. You guys take a seat first. I'll cook some delicious food for you guys. Okay. Fung, actually you bought this drug from the phramacy. Shh, it is a white lie. Hey, what did you see again? Um. Anyway, they are all nice. I thought I would see some ghosts here. - You could eat anything - You like, but should be careful for what you are offensing. That would upset those friends around. You got what I mean, right? Fung. Your classmates? Yes. We are from the history club and we are all gifted students. Fung told us that this school is full of history. As we are gifted students we should come to memorialize the school. Good, good. Don't pretend. You are just good at fooling around. Gifted student. Didn't I tell you? Mind your words. Which will upset those friends around. Right. You guys had better not walking around at night. No matter what you see, no matter what you hear just leave it alone. Just stay in your room and sleep early would be okay. Sister kuen, why can't we? Is the school dangerous at night? What happended before? No matter what happened either human beings or ghosts be respectful to each other should be the way. You guys take a rest and have some food. Fung, is here a haunted place? No I used to wandered around at night and I have seen nothing. This is just to scare those lower grade students. Um. But she just looks so weird. Yes. There must be some untold secrets. What secret could that be? Right, there is a small supermarket around the school. Do you guys need to buy anything? Sure, at least some beers right? Wow. How can we stay here? You stay. Wow. Are we here in a disaster zone mistakenly? So dirty. How can we sleep even? So dirty around. You just filled the room with dust. The principal is so nice to us. Fung, are we going to stay in this room tonight? Our rooms are upstairs. What's wrong? Very painful. Why's that? The dust flew into my eyes. The dust got into her eyes. Let me take you to the washroom. - Let's go to the washroom. - Let's go, go. No need to go to washroom. Just give a spit would be okay. Go away, ah, go away. Trust me. Go away. Here is the washroom. Get off from me. Let me help you to blow, just a blow. Just one blow, let me blow you. Do you feel better? How is it? Still a little bit pricking. Do you need me to blow? Thank you. Splash me? Hey. Ain't I scared? Come on. Come and help, fung. What's the matter? I saw a ghost. Really? Behind shing li. I see nothing. Perhaps the online rumors are true? It's over there. There is truly a ghost. You! Must have listened too much stories from her, and therefore got influence. It's truly over there. Ghost, ghost, please come out again. I really want to meet you. Please come out again. I really want to meet you. Ghost! It's behind you. There are so many of them. You psycho, don't splash. I really want to meet you. Have something to say, speak to me. Show up. Ghost, ghost. I beg you to show up and shut the bitch. She is a real trouble, ghost. I did see a ghost. It was behind shing li. You think too much. Let's put down our stuff first. Um? See you later. Hurry up, my bag is so heavy. Okay. It is even that scary in daytime. Hey, wait for me. Hey, did you peek at girls taking shower here? I am not as sick as you are. Don't pretend, young guys always do that. Who is she? I don't know. Hi Are you here for archaeology, student? I am shing li. Nice to meet you. Hi, I am the teacher taking internship. My surname is fong, you can call me miss fong. My surname is fong, you can call me miss fong. Wow, awesome. You look very young as a teacher. I am just a student teacher, not a licensed one. But, is this school going to be shut down? Why are you still here? I miss this place. I want to stay here until the last minute. And I can take care of graduated students who come back for memorial. How long have you been teaching in this school? I feel you are lookalike one of my classmate. Such a cliche, to meet a girl with this trick. Look very alike. You guys settle down first. Miss, we have just been here and not familiar with the place. Could you take us to walk around? The principal asked us to go to the study room. Let me go check the girls, see if they need any help. We meet downstairs after ten minutes. And I will take you guys to the study room. Actually I don't need to settle. Let's go together. Let's go. She is mine. It's scary here and only the three of us stay here. I am scared. Relax, I have seen everywhere. It is "all clear". And the boys are just upstairs. If anything happens, just yell, "fung, I am so scared!" Don't you say that, I am truly frightened. Hey, you go to hell. Fuck you. It is smelly. You deserve it. None of my business. Who allow you to scare me this is? I'm the intern teacher, you may call me miss fong. Are you all ready? The principal is waiting for us in the study room. I am going to make you pay off, you bastard. You deserve it. Let's go. Thanks to miss fong, I won't blame you. Hi, I am lai. A hiccup is an involuntary contraction of the diaphragm. Now you take a deep breath. Hold it, don't exhale, until you cannot. Let's do it again. Heard from fung, you all are very interested in the school history. So you guys must have done some research from online. Yes, tak yuk college is very famous in past. A lot of politicians, celebrities and movie stars were graduated from tak yuk. Why such a famous school got shut down? Is it possible that the ghost rumors from Internet are true? Miss fong, don't you teach english? I remember a few years ago I watched a Japanese drama, named "terms of a bitch". The story was about a teacher fell in love with a student, and they decided to runaway. The teacher, nanako matsushima, undoubtedly played very well and the main actor, hideaki takizawa also has the shyness of that kind of student. There was a scene I remembered well. They are in the library, doing that thing. Hey, can you be quiet? Thank you. I'll tell you the most fabulous scene later. But principal, I still think that the main reason is the ghost rumor. We heard during the invasion of China by the imperial Japanese army, people who died here, they became ghosts and victimized. Maybe the one who wrote that would not have an answer either. But there are truly numerous marks of war left. The documents recorded the brutal experiments ran by the imperial Japanese army in the past. As to enjoy the dying process slowly, the imperial Japanese army built this bleeding chamber. They make a small cut on the side of the foot of the war prisoners for bleeding out. The war prisoners watched themselves drying out of blood slowly and died desperately painful. The imperial Japanese army even held killing competitions here. The one who had the highest record killed 108 war prisoners per minute. All of its details recorded in the school's museum. Wow, the photos are disgusting. Why are you so frightened? The Japanese just grabbed men to torture, they made women to be comfort women only. Forced to be comfort women was a horrible thing. They were violated and humiliated by the sick imperial Japanese army everyday. Their bodies and minds were deeply tortured. And even infected with venereal disease. The infected comfort women were treated as research objects, they were tortured to death slowly, as well as further abused mentally. The dignity as human being was completely written off. They were descended as sexual slavery. If the comfort woman was pregnant, she would be forced to have an abortion, forcibly to have caesarian operation. Youngster, please pay respect to comfort women. I am sorry, principal. Principal, why is this Japanese sword specially displayed here? This is not an imitation. It was excavated while building this new campus. It's getting late and I should get going. Fung, remember to lock the door. Yes, principal. That comfort woman was pretty. Hey, can you please show some respect to women? I admire her beauty doesn't mean that I don't respect her. Just the same as I admire miss fong's beauty too. She is really hot. What? Did you guys see that? What? There is a kid. Isn't it? I see nothing, don't scare me. You saw that too? Yes that kid is skinny. Yes, he is playing with a ball. You guys stop teasing her. Yes, we all see that. Yes. I really didn't see anything. So horrible! Let's go, let's go. Little ming, it's dinner time. Little ming, it's dinner time. I am getting old. Getting useless, slow and hinder the work. No, sister kuen, you misunderstood. This is not what I mean. This is not what you mean? This school is going to be shut down. Why do you have to get rid of me? Don't persuade me anymore. I will persist until the last moment. Principal. You know the school means to me. I have a lot of memories in here. I just can't let go. I know that you are worried about my safety being alone here. If I stay on my own in an empty home, I might get dementia instead. Okay. But you have to promise me and let me do those heavy work. Why would you need to do heavy work? I have an assistant. Fung. But you have to do it slowly, no rush. I'm get going then. Thank you principal. Thank you principal. Maybe leaving is a good thing. Maybe something has to be let go. Pui fong still haven't return, how could I leave? Why are you running through my stuff? I am your mother and it is my right to run through your stuff. You are violating my privacy. Privacy? Why didn't you talk about privacy while I was changing your diaper? Mom, I have grown up! You are so grown up to sign on behalf of me? You take a look at your school transcript. It's unbelivable bad. Open examination is around the corner, do you want to continue your studies? Forge my signature. Why do you behave so badly? I am that bad, so what? Stand right there. I need to talk to you, you stand there. Pui fong, what if I open a snack shop outside the school, good? It's nice. I don't think the food was that good. I was talking about the lady owner. Sex maniac. I am nice too. You shut up. Her figure is in size "d". Could you handle that big size? You can feel it. You cannot put into words. What? It cannot be spoken. - Fung. - You dirty beggar. Just leave him alone. What happened? Miss fong, there is a beggar and I am scared. Fung, come in quickly. Hurry, hurry that beggar has some mental issue, just ignore him. Go back. Go. Why did you prevent me from holding miss fong? It's rarely that she took the move. Who is in a rush? No. I am still in shower. What's the matter with you? Did you see something? No. Don't you dare to scare me. You get back inside. What? The water what water? Nothing, it's nothing. Then let's leave. Are you alright? Go. Let's go. Who is it? Who is it? Hey. Are those three bitches teasing me? Sister kuen. Let me take care of it. Um. Then you go back to the dorm. It's dark, be careful. Go, go. Okay come, come. Come back. Take it, which could bless your safety. Go. Um, okay. Go, go. Just go. Dear all, please in peace, kids are ignorant about the world. Please don't blame him. If you need to blame someone, blame me. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I won again! It is not fun, you won whole night. It's still early. Let's find something to do. It's late, what could we do? It's hard to come to this gruesome school, we absolutely have to play some exciting games. What? Museum adventure. Great, hey. Let's get going. Could we play something else? Sure. Let's play... just leave you alone in the dorm? Aiya, I am here and what are you afraid of? If I see them, I definitely will tell you. What are you guys doing? Why do you guys still not going to bed? Sleep? You can sleep longer if you die earlier, go away. Ghost run is there really ghost? It must be shing li. He suddenly screamed ghost and everybody ran away. It is fine. It is scary here, why don't we find them and we all leave together? Sure. Give them a chance. Succeeded or not is totally up to them. Hiu yu is timid and this place is gruesome, she must stick with fung closely. Ah, this place is horrifying. Look at me. Don't be afraid. I am here. Fung. Hiu yu. Wait. Where is lai? Right. Did lai this fool run so slow and get caught by someone? I go find lai and you waited for me here. Let's go together. Let's go together. Shing li. Mei kei. Where are you guys? Fung. Fung. Fung. Fung. Aren't you a man? You left first. What? Ain't I man enough to go finding lai? But we can still go together. Anyway, didn't you see something? I saw a lot of "children". What do they look? Like ghosts. Which means... Secondary school students. Students? Yes. This is a school. You liar. Do you really think that I will believe without thinking. I bet that was you I really saw it. Your ass is too big and hit the chairs and tables. Hey. Of course not. Fung. Hey, fung. Hey, where did you guys go? How's it? You kissed? No, where have you guys been to? Hey, fung. Fung. Fung. Fung. Fung. Fung. Fung. Fung. Fung. Fung, are you okay? Why are you guys so noisy in the mid-night? What's happening? But why the lamp fell down? I don't know, I feel weird too. I am glad that you are fine. Fung, I won't be afraid if you hold me. Is your stomach okay? Yes. Um, why I was there for? How can you ask? What? You, did you know that you blow up my whole plan? We agreed to turn right after getting out of the door. You turned left. Exactly. Turn right? There are certain school facilities without maintenance for years, you guys don't wander around, it is not good if accident were happened. Shing li, luckily we got you this time. Yes, miss fong, as I did that great, do I get any rewards? Fung, is hiu yu your girlfriend? Um, yes. They have been together for a long time. But I don't have a girlfriend, how about you miss fong? It's getting late, let me walk you guys back to the dorm. Let's go. I really don't have a girlfriend, miss fong. I personally think that students should focus on their study. Actually I am deeply interested in this school history, doesn't miss fong come up and we have a long talk tonight? If we talk too late, then we sleep. It is getting windy tonight, get yourself warm. Um. Don't catch a cold. Miss fong, you do really care about me. Pervert, get going. Leave. Let's go to bed. Are you really not coming? Miss fong? Wow! What are you doing? I can't sleep. Can I sleep with you? I am so scared. What's the matter? What's the matter? Girl. Just go to bed. Um... Um... my rheumatism. Sister kuen. Didn't you say someone will prepare the setting for you in the morning? Yes. But I just want to come earlier and open by myself. Where did you put the drug, sister kuen? I put in there. Okay. Ah, weather changes. You, please don't make yourself too tired, you need to take care of yourself, okay? Where is the Jade that I gave you? Here. Um. Miss fong what a coincidence, are you waiting for me? The principal asked me to come and see if I can help with anything. And also to introduce the bibliography region to you all, let's go. Miss fong you are so good to me. Can we take a look? Sure. Book of weird news? This is our school tradition. Both teachers and students could leave messages freely in the book. The more messages people leave, the more information that can received, and the closer to the truth. School hunk competition. So shabby. The things that written on the book, were they true? Undoubtedly fake! Even if it was true, how could they be okay after writing these down. Thus that ghost is not scary enough. The school is always chilly. There is a voice singing sadly in the playground every night. It is spine-chilling and heartbreaking. You always feel like someone is staring at your back when you walk alone. Perhaps Cheng pui fong did get caught by them. There is a report about the mysterious missing of Cheng pui fong. Sister kuen. Cheng pui fong is sister kuen's daughter? Um. Sister kuen keeps rejecting to retire because she is waiting for her daughter return. Um? Fung. Is that boy you? You take a look at your school transcript. It is poor! Open examination is around the corner, do you want to continue your studies? Forge my signature. Why do you behave so badly? I am that bad, so what? So what? Stand right there. I need to talk to you, you stand there. This is a mysterious missing case that happened seven years ago. It caused a small sensation back then. And the school canceled the dormitory policy because of this. The missing person, who is a female student. Cheng pui fong. Miss fong you have been here for that long have you seen that white dressed ghost? Yes. She is behind you. There are truly a lot of ghost rumors. In the past, the imperial Japanese army slaughtered a lot of pregnant women and war prisoners. They were devoid of humanity. They used this Japanese sword and played stabbing fetus game. It is said that the ghosts of pregnant women couldn't rest in peace and they needed to find their babies as to dissolve the grievance. In 1941, the principal at that time and some staff were moved to a prison camp, the school was expropriated as the base of the imperial Japanese army and also their training center. They forced Chinese to learn Japanese. Tried to use language to enslave Chinese. Fung. I specially found these books for you guys, take them. Thank you principal. Um. Hey, hey, hey. Why sister kuen praying so late at night? Shing li, later you go to steal the chicken for our late snack. Are you crazy? Capture food from the ghosts, you are really insane. Psycho. I am hungry. Pui fong take a look of this clothes. It is new style with your favourite color. Even it is a little bit pricey. It's okay. As long as you like it. Tell me if you like it. Tell me either if you don't. I'll buy from other shops. I won't leave. I am staying here. I need to figure out what happened, where have you been buried. Pui fong I just saw you argued with sister kuen. If you have any difficulties in studying, I can help you. What do you want to say? I like you. Sister kuen is so pitiful. She has to live by herself at this age. It is harsh. Do you think if Cheng pui fong is dead? You still have to ask? It has been seven years! Definitely dead. I bet she is still alive. She must have left with a boy. It's a waste that sister kuen spending her lifetime saving to buy hell money for her. How can you say things like this? Are you really not afraid of ghosts? I'm not afraid. The ghosts that I have seen are very gentle. Don't say that. Really? Aren't you say that you are not afraid? Liar. Shing li. You are so man. Of course. Let me put off your fires and help you to see ghosts more easily. Let's go, bye-bye. Ghost, ghost, his fire of Yang is off. Go get him quickly. Ghost, ghost, go get him quickly. Bye-bye. Ghost, ghost, his fire of Yang is off. You find him quickly. Ghost, ghost, his fire of Yang is off. You find him quickly. If you are not scared to hell tonight, I will not go to jerk off for a week. Little ming. Why are you still up so late? Why are you still up so late? Your mother will get worried. Bitch. Put off my fire of Yang. Moron. Wow. What the fuck! There is a ghost. There is a ghost in the washroom. It is not the first time that you see a ghost. Ah, don't wake me up. Hey, hey hey hey Coming, coming, coming. Who's that early? Is shing li with you? No. He didn't sleep in the dorm last night. I called him but he didn't answer too. Slinking out? He wouldn't miss the call even slinking out. I am afraid that he might got in danger. Right you put off his fire of Yang last night. Come on? You all believe in that too? He must be hiding somewhere to scare us? Let me see, how about this, you two try to find him in the dorm, hiu yu and I go to search the museum. Let's meet up downstairs later. Let's go. Um. Let's get changed. Shing li. Shing li is shing li in there? Open the door. Shing li. Shing li please come out, stop playing. Is shing li in there? I can't see clearly. I may not see very clearly. What? Why aren't they here yet? They must be very busy today. Assignment is important, but eating is also important too. I'd better get prepared, or it will be chaos if a group of them come altogether. Mother. Why do you become so bad? I am that bad, so what? Thank you for your clothes. Pui fong. You look at the clothes. It is new style. Very pretty. Shing li. Shing li. Shing li. Stop playing, come out! Shing li. - Hey, it is not funny at all. - Shing li. Come out! Come out! Come out! Shing li. Shing li. He is not here, let's go? Or, let's find fung and hiu yu first. Okay. Hey. It sounds like shing li's voice. Does it? Shing li. Hey. Shing li, stop hiding, I hear you. Shing li. Hey, did you really hear? Hey. Shh. I am here. Shing li. Shing li. What? Shing li. Shing li. Shing li. Shing li. Shing li is here. Shing li. Shing li. Shing li didn't get hurt seriously. Just a tiny wound on his finger. His head is not hit as well. Why was he faint in there? And dressed like this. It's fine, it's fine. Shing li. You are awake. Shing li. Are you alright? Are you do you remember how did you get in there? Shing li, do you recognize us? Do you know who we are? I think we'd better let him rest first. You guys also go to rest earlier. Perhaps we leave, quick. - Let's go. - Then, we leave first. You take a good rest. Shing li. I just saw you in the museum, do you remember? And you laughed to me, do you remember? Oh my god, shing li is so pathetic. He looks dull. Did he really run into ghosts? If there are ghosts, it is good for him to get scared. He always say bad things, otherwise, how could he learn to behave? Instead of worrying about him, we'd better to worry about ourselves. What's the matter? What's the matter with us? Don't you dare to scare me. I saw ghosts here yesterday. I am still terrifying. Moreover, and seeing shing li like that, I really want to leave. Don't you always see ghosts? Maybe we leave. So what should we do now? The stairs is over there, let me count to three, then we all run. One two. Run Um, I need to go out. Please don't wander around. Hiu yu hasn't return yet. Would she be fine? It's late, what's the matter? Can you help me? How can I help? Ho sze fung. Don't you dare to like me even if you are a top student. It is exactly because there are people like you to make me look like a loser. Do you know why we have been classmates for three years but we haven't talked for more than 10 sentenses each time? I feel disgusting to hear your voice. Besides studying, what else can you do? How dare you say you like me? Do you believe that I scream "you molest me"? Your future will be ruined. If you like me, you should do things that make me happy. Seeing you being ruined will make me happy. Kill me, kill me. No courage? Kill me. Just kill me. Is it hiu yu? Hey. Is it you? Who is it? Hiu yu, is it you? Hiu yu? Stop playing. Hiu yu? Is that you? Help! Help! Fung, hiu yu, where are you guys? Help! Little ming, come here for dinner. Come, eat them all. Little ming, little ming. Eat slowly, no rush. Little ming, little ming. What did you just call him? Little ming my dog. What? Did you see him? Little ming dinner time. Keep it. It will keep you safe, go. Okay. You cannot put into words. It cannot be spoken. You need to perceive it by yourself. You can feel it. You cannot put into words. It cannot be spoken. You need to perceive it by yourself. You need to perceive it by yourself. You can feel it. You cannot put into words. It cannot be spoken. You need to perceive it by yourself. You can feel it. You cannot put into words. I feel sick when I hear your voice. What else do you know except studying? Ho sze fung, it is exactly because of you that make me look bad. What a man sows, what shall he reap. It is all controlled by you. To be trapped in this place for many years. I'm lonely. I want to get out of here. Can you help me? I am sorry. I am so sorry. I made a mistake. I was wrong. I am sorry. I am sorry. Hey is the school rumor true? I have seen a lot of ghosts here. Hiu yu hasn't still come back. Let's go to find hiu yu. Hurry up. What's happened? Where is hiu yu? Go. Let's go. Sister kuen. Sister kuen. Sister kuen. Wow. Why are you guys that late? Sister kuen. Have you seen hiu yu and miss fong? Miss fong? Who is miss fong? The intern teacher. What? The school is going to be shut down, how come we would hire an intern teacher? I watched a Japanese drama, named "terms of a bitch". Fung. What's the matter with you guys? Let's go. Hey, what is going on? What happened? Uncle. Let's go. I am sorry. Cheng pui fong. I shouldn't have covered up. Hiu yu. Hiu yu. Hiu yu. Where is he? Get back to the dorm. I am making up everyday. You thought that giving her a job, adding her salary, is a compensation? I am fung's uncle. I couldn't stand for ruining his future. It sounds so sweet. You selfish man. You just did it for yourself. You don't want to ruin your future. Then I deserve to have no future? Hiu yu. This way. I am sorry. Cheng pui fong. It is my fault, I am sorry. It is my fault - hiu yu. I am sorry. I am sorry, Cheng pui fong. It is my fault. Fung. It has been seven years. It is time to expiate your sin. Hiu yu. Hiu yu. Cheng pui fong. It is my fault, I was wrong. Uncle. What is it? Pui fong. To expiate sin, not just merely to apologize and compensate. And also need to get a proper punishment. Fung. Why did you do this to me? When the sword got into my body. It was painful. Pui fong. Don't you like me? Why do you make me so painful? If I didn't die, my mother would not be that harsh. Don't you want to expiate sin? Let me help you. Don't, fung. Open examination wil be soon, do you want to keep studying? Forge my signature. Why do you become so bad? I am that bad, so what? What? Pui fong. I just saw you argued with sister kuen. In fact... In fact... what? If you have any difficulties in studying, I can help you. What do you want to say? I want to help you. Why do you want to help me? I like you. Ho sze fung. Don't you dare to like me even if you are a top student. It is exactly because there are people like you to make me look like a loser. Do you know why during these three years we haven't talked much? It is because I don't want to talk to you. I feel disgusting to hear your voice. What else do you know except studying? How dare you say you like me? You don't need to say these things even if you don't like me. I like saying and doing this. Don't you like me? Then you should do things that make me happy. Seeing your life ruined completely is my happiest thing. Do you believe that I scream "you molest me"? Your future will be ruined completely. Good. Come on. You have already touched my hand. Come on. Aren't you very good? Then touch me. Come on, come on. Come on. Ho sze fung. What? Stone-dead has no fellow? Bleeding. I am bleeding. You are game over. Your life is over. School manager chan. It is late, what's the matter? Ka kit, I bet you are still in the school. The graduation ceremony tomorrow is also your official inauguration. It's a big day, go home earlier and take rest. Thank you school manager chan. I am going home now. Fung. Sister kuen. The police has confirmed it's Cheng pui fong's body. My condolences. Sister kuen. We leave now, you take care of yourself. Hmm. You all take care too. Good-bye.
