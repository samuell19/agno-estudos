[ Music ] [ Noise ] [ Music ] [ Noise ] >> Impossible. [ Noise ] [ Music ] [Inaudible Remark] [ Music ] [ Silence ] [Knocking at the Door] >> Alfonso. Come in. >> I heard you had an urgent call. Is everything all right? >> A very, very dear friend of mine from overseas was murdered. >> Oh, my dear friend. What happened? >> They-- I don't have-- I don't have the details but it was-- it was violent. >> How horrible. >> Was he being robbed? >> I don't know. He had knowledge of many things. >> I know there's nothing I can say that would make anything better, but perhaps I can help some. >> How? >> I just received a message from a colleague of mine at University of Chicago. They have satellite images that seemed to indicate an undiscovered Native American site in the Four Corners area. But their budget cuts. They can't afford to send out a dig team so they've offered the lead to us. I know this is a favorite topic of yours, I thought you might be interested in hitting the dig. Now William, if now is not a good time for you to go, I understand completely-- >> No, no, no. I-- I think it would be good. I-- I'd-- I would like something to help clear my mind of this. I want to do it. >> Good. I thought you might. I've already emailed you the details. You put together your dig team and I'll have a support crew meet you at the site. >> Alfonso. >> Yes? >> Thank you! >> Anytime, William. And William, if you ever need to talk, you can always trust me. 20 years at this university, you have never let me down. >> How could I? I'd never want to incur the wrath of the famous old battle ax. [ Silence ] [ Music ] [Background Music] Alfred, what were you into? What are you trying to tell me? >> That was no mistake, and Alfred, there-- their Templar are nice. >> But this doesn't make sense to me. It can't be a coincidence. >> What is it then? >> Well, the number-- the number nine, it keeps cropping up. >> Well, there was originally nine knights that started the order, right, right, right? And they served nine years before the Council of Choice provided them with the order and they were founded in 1119. >> Okay, but what does it mean? >> I'm not sure. But something is calling us. >> Like I can't-- I can't rest. Alfred, there's something about these men. Something disturbs me. Nine. Nine. [Phone Ringing] >> Archeology department, Renee speaking. Of course, what's going on? >> Dean Castillo just gave us a dig in Four Corners. I want you to pull together a team, some diggers, equipment, everything you can get, have them there in two days. >> Equipment might be an issue because Marion has got her postdoc next week in Montana. >> Marion, perfect. She needs to come with us. >> William, it's her postdoc. >> Just tell her. It's important, she'll come. >> Okay. I'm going to talk to Nathan Sullivan, I saw him today and he'll handle the sonogram. >> No! He's good but I don't want an academic. I want Melvin on this. Can you get him? >> I don't know where he is. >> Is he still sending pictures of himself proposing to you on the phone? >> I just got one two days ago. >> Perfect, track him down. I got to go. >> Where are you? Are you still in the Belize? [ Inaudible Remark ] I need in you in Four Corners right now. [Inaudible Remark] >> Not for me, for Professor Sinclair, he needs you in two days. [Inaudible Remark] >> I spoke with Allison Carter of the Bozeman University Archeology Department, and she said that she can put six freshmen interns for the duration of the dig. >> That's fantastic. >> This is Dean Thompson. How are you? >> Hello, Ms. Renee. We're just finalizing the details of Marion's postgraduate research. She's going to be supervising the international dig site up in the Canadian border. >> Marion, Professor Sinclair is gathering a team for a dig in Four Corners. >> I would love to be involved. When? >> Two days. >> Two days? >> Impossible. And I know that Professor Sinclair would agree with me that this supervisory opportunity for Marion is just too important for her career. >> Who is on the team? >> Myself and Melvin. >> Dr. Lamasi [phonetic], I know that Professor Sinclair has been like a father to you but he knows how difficult it's been to get funding for your research. >> I'm sorry but I have to do this. >> Okay. I'll do what I can. Say hi to William for me. >> Dr. Thompson. >> Dean Castillo. I was just going to send you an email. Dr. Lamasi has to postpone our postdoc research. >> Would she be joining she be joining Sinclair's dig in Southern Utah? >> Actually yeah. I'm worried about losing the funding-- >> No, no. I'll take care of it. >> Great. >> All right thank you, Russell. >> Yeah. >> Say hello to your wife. >> I'll do it. [ Noise ] [ Music ] >> [Background Music] All right, we have some daylight. [ Music ] [Noise] >> This is remarkable. >> Tales of treasure? Knowledge? Wisdom even. Now what would you give to that kind of wealth. >> Well, the legends are pretty farfetched and gold is gold but discovery of this kind of knowledge? Now that would be the real treasure. [ Music ] >> That is what makes you noble, friend. [Noise] [ Music ] >> Are you okay? >> Yeah. >> No, really. Are you okay? [ Silence ] >> I'll be fine. >> Okay. [ Noise ] >> What's up with the ax today? It's usually about deep in dirt by now. >> You're right. I've never seen him like this before. I think something is bothering him. [ Noise ] >> Stop staring. >> Nope. I don't want to. >> How is it going over here? >> Good. How about yourself? You need water, or massage, or you want a husband? >> You're funny, Melvin. >> Yeah, funny me. >> Hey, look at that. >> Shall we say something? >> What do you think, Marion? Cute? >> Worth a try. How's your pronunciation? >> I've been told it sounds like an archeology rant being strangled. >> 'Cause you are an archeologist, duh. >> The scary thing is that he finished his undergrad. >> Renee? >> I'll try. I wish you good luck. >> [Background Music] Professor Sinclair. [ Music ] >> We do have permission to be here, right? >> The Professor takes care of all that. As far as I know, this was old state own property. >> Maybe he thinks this is tribal lands. >> Let's just hope he doesn't get nasty. [ Music ] >> You guys, I think I've got something. You know what? I definitely have something. >> What is it? >> Rectangular, defined corners, six feet long, four feet wide, four feet deep? >> Professor Sinclair! >> Professor! [ Music ] >> What do you have? [ Music ] Get the shovels. [ Music ] >> Sir, we have lock up location. Yes sir. [ Music ] [ Noise ] >> All right we've got something. [ Silence ] [ Music ] This can't be. This is impossible. >> What is it? >> It almost looks European. >> This is impossible. >> Professor? >> Open it. >> What? >> Who knows what the air might do to whatever is inside. >> We should scan it before we even touch it. >> I said open it. [noise] Come on. Come on! [ Music & Noise ] >> Wow. Okay. [ Music ] >> What does that mean, Professor? >> It means we're going to need help. >> Robert Sinclair. >> What's up man? >> How have you been, man? >> Good. >> It's been a long time. >> Thanks for meeting with me. >> You can get a hold of me anytime, you know that. >> Thanks. >> Serious? Well, I should charge you double for getting me up this early. [ Music ] >> [Background Music] Come on. I ain't baby sitting you. Move it! That's all you got, seriously? Come on. >> What the hell is this, Robert? >> Bullshit, come on. It could be nothing. >> Come on. This ain't no sweet. >> Move it. What do you pay me for? I ain't baby sitting you. Move! Come on. Move! Come on. Focus man, focus. [ Music ] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, do it! [ Music & Noise ] We got a long way to go, man. >> Is it time? >> Yup. [noise] So, what you got going on today? >> I got to meet with the museum at noon. They got these new Arms and Armor Renaissance exhibit. I don't know what the hell they're doing. Then I got to go meet with these computer game software nerds that are developing some sort of fighting game that means bullshit. >> That was the fine cannon that would fire, huh? >> You have no idea. >> You kidding me? You don't mean ninja wannabes I have to deal with everyday? It's ridiculous. [ Noise ] >> Mr. Sinclair, we're so stoked to have you on the dungeon doomed team. >> [Background Music] Look. Robert, it's just fine, okay? And I'm only a temporary consultant so, unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to join the office softball team, all right? [Laughter] >> No, no, no. >> There's no softball. >> I think, like I told you, we're going to this way sweet game where you like to take warriors from like centuries and different like countries and they come together and they fight it out. >> So, we'd heard you're like the today master of historical fighting and swords and we just knew we had to have you on board. >> Oh, well, I forgot. The best part is like you're the warriors there are like weapons and there are like armor like it's totally interchangeable so you could like have maybe a knight over the round table with like Kevlar armor with a Viking horned helmets swinging a Katana. >> In between that guy and the pirate with the Robin Hood bow and like samurai armor and Conan the Barbarian sword, who do you think will win? Who would win? >> You guys done? Look, I don't want to offend you, guys, I like you bu that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. >> Well, we knew it was a little-- >> Fantasy. >> No, a little? That's it. You can't mix different time periods and different cultures, it never works, it never has worked, okay? Each specific weapon has specific time period associated with it, and you can sit there and mix them up and assume that it's going to be a good video game. >> So-- so wait. What if we take warriors from the same time period like a ninja fighting a musketeer? >> No. >> All three musketeers or just one? >> We are talking about a ninja here so it'd have to be all three musketeers, [inaudible]. [ Music ] >> [Background Music] Hello? >> Hey, it's me. Don't-- don't hang up. I really need your help. >> What the hell do you want? >> I can't talk about it over the phone. I'm at a dig site near Four Corners. >> I could care less where you're at. Listen, I got to go. >> It's a matter of life and death. Please. >> [Sighs] Okay. >> Right. How quickly can you get here? >> Tomorrow. >> I'll wait for you in the morning. And one more thing, be careful. [ Music ] Cover that dig site up for the night. Marion, bring the sword. [ Music ] >> Professor, [inaudible] this? >> No, you better hold on to it, way too obvious. >> All right. Are you sure? >> Yeah. Whatever cost you make, protect that sword. >> I think the battle ax [inaudible]. >> He is acting very strange. >> That's true. >> All right, good morning. [ Noise ] [ Music & Noise ] >> [Background Music] Need any help? >> No. Thank you though. [ Music ] [ Noise ] >> [Background Music] Just give me the sword. >> What the hell is going on in here? >> It doesn't concern you, boy. I wouldn't consider that if I were you. [ Music ] >> Talking Espanol? >> Si. Si. >> [Foreign Language] Robert. >> Ola, Robert. [ Foreign Language ] >> Look, we got to call the police right now. >> No, no, no, no, I'm-- I'm okay. I'm okay now. No-- it's not a big deal. >> You sure? >> Yeah. Thank you. >> Okay. Make sure you double lock the door, okay? >> I'll keep that in mind. Thank you Robert, thank you. [ Foreign Language ] [ Music ] [ Silence ] [ Music ] [ Music & Noise ] >> [Background Music] Your son. Be glorious. Whatever dad. [ Music & Noise ] >> Robert, you made it. >> You want to tell me what the hell I'm doing out here? >> You're out here because I need your help. >> Why don't you tell me what you really want, dad? Are you still [inaudible] family? [ Noise ] >> Who's that? >> Who does he think he is? >> Hey everyone. I want you to meet Robert. He's going to be helping us out. >> So, you two, you two know each other? >> I helped her out with teeth problem that we have last night. >> What is he talking about? >> It's nothing, Professor. >> Tell me exactly what happened. >> Last night, this guy chased me to my room and he tried to steal the sword. >> The sword? >> And Robert here saw it happening, well. >> I took care of him. >> Why didn't you tell me this? >> Professor, I just didn't what to worry you about it. >> He was trying to steal the sword. Did either of you notice anything that looked like a three-teared purple cross? >> Purple cross? What have you got in yourself into, dad? >> We've made an amazing discovery. [ Music & Noise ] >> [Background Music] This is a joke, right? You guys planted this? >> You know, we've been doing this long enough to know when something has been planted. >> Plus the soil would have been disturbed on the radar. This is genuine. [ Music ] >> European features, Caucasian. >> You say you have the sword? >> Yes, we do. [ Music ] >> Well, it's quite sturdy. You don't have to be so gentle with it. >> She still has an edge. >> Well? >> It can't be what you think. It's too pristine. >> But what does your analysis tell you? >> Oakeshott, type 18A. Most pristine I've ever seen. >> And the date? >> It doesn't matter. It can't be what you wanted to be. >> Robert, the date? >> It's impossible. >> Please, what is it? >> Look, based of the-- the clothing and the armor and this, late 1200s, early 13 but it's clearly impossible. >> How can you be sure? >> Well, I should have told you earlier but Robert is a very accomplished spathologist and hoplologist. >> Who and what? >> Spathology and hoplology, it's fairly new terms for a very exact type of science. >> Renee, any ideas? >> Spathology, the Greek, spathe for sword. >> Excellent, excellent. Although more specifically the study and classification of swords. And haplology? >> Not sure. >> Marion? >> What, you now are going to bother asking me? >> Should I? >> The Greek hoplites? >> Excellent. >> So, what does that mean? >> That means I know about swords and how to use them. >> But that sword doesn't explain what a European knight is doing in the middle of the Southwest American desert in the 14th century. >> Well, I believe that this is no ordinary European knight. >> I need to come up with some crackpot theory. >> You solved a lot of [inaudible]. >> Come on. >> What else could it be? That grave holds the remains of a man who was once a member of a very elite and prestigious organization. It was known as the Order of the Poor Knights of the Temple of Solomon. >> It's impossible. >> Later, they were known simply as the Knights Templar. [ Music & Noise ] >> There's simply no concrete evidence to support it. >> Robert, the evidence is right over there and part of it is actually concrete. >> This entire site is inconsistent with historical record. I mean, who the hell led you guys here anyway? >> We got a tip that this was a potential Native American dig site. >> Have you found any other artifacts? >> Yes, but they seemed to be Anasazi which was odd. >> Why? >> Well, the Anasazi lands were more in the Mesa Verde area. >> See, more inconsistencies, thus, lending less credibility to this site. >> All right. Well, what if you consider-- >> There is no what if, dad. This isn't one of your wacky conspiracy theories, all right? I'm sorry. >> Robert, you're simply not seeing the entire picture here. >> Even if that skeleton is real, one bazaar tomb in the middle of the desert doesn't confirm any evidence of a transatlantic pre-Columbian migration. >> All right, one find, yes. But there are others. >> Where? What-- they haven't been debunked? >> The Westford Knight. >> Those scratchings are hardly considered evidence. >> And what about the Camerons [phonetic] at Oak Island? >> You mean sink holes? >> Okay. So the area is malleable. And it's prone to cave-ins. There's been a lot of debate and discussion about subterranean caverns and passageways. >> What was their purpose? >> Some people believed that the Knights Templar had bowl loads of treasure when they left Europe and they needed somewhere to stash it. >> But nothing is there. >> Correct. >> Not anymore. >> What's the treasure even supposed to be? >> If you're not familiar with the Knights Templar, you wouldn't know. >> Well, the Knights Templar began shortly after the first crusades in 1099. Some of the European warriors had decided to stay behind and to join religious orders centering on the Church of the Holly Sepulchre which was a traditional burial site of Jesus Christ. But as religious pilgrims began to make their way to visit the Holy City, a lot of them fell under attack by the bandits and Muslims opposing the crusader occupation. And this continued to happen. So these warriors decided to take action. They sought to form an order to protect these pilgrims from harm. By 1129, they've been officially approved by the Pope and with that blessing came the financial backing of all Christian Europe. For the next 180 years, the Templars grew in size and they grew in popularity and they grew in wealth. And for reasons that we still don't understand, by the early 14th century, the Pope had the decided that the Templars weren't needed anymore. And rather than simply disband the order, he sent out orders to a secret group of assassins we now know as the Plaga [phonetic] to hunt down and to imprison and to kill all the Knights Templar. It was a massacre. With almost no warning, the entire Templar order was wiped out. But it was rumored that some of the knights survived. Many believed that the Pope was after the Templar's wealth. However, when the Pope's man arrived at the various Templar holdings, they were empty. A lot of what happened after that has been lost to history and has been distorted by myths and by legends. Some believe that the Templar remnants continue to operate in one of the few safe havens in Europe, maybe Scotland. And others believe that some of the Templars boarded ships that were field with all of their treasures and that they sailed off into the west, never to be heard from again. >> But nothing was ever found. >> Until today. >> Well, one knight's body is hardly a treasure. >> Robert, you know more about medieval weaponry than probably anybody on the earth. Now, just for a moment, forget about the circumstances of this particular find and tell me, what does that sword tell you? >> I'd have to know the makers more about. >> Hmm, look at that. But when you turn the sword fast like that, you can see the sun sitting in the valley. >> Let me see that. [ Music ] Robert, how many times have you seen a sword with different markings on each side of the blade? >> Never. >> I think we have ourselves a map. >> Come on, dad, even if it is a map, I mean it's a sun in a valley, there's tens of thousands of valleys all over the planet. >> Too bad they didn't hammer in GPS coordinates. [ Music ] >> Alfred, what were you in to? What are you trying to tell me? [ Music ] >> Professor, what did I say? There's not going to be GPS coordinates on a 700-year-old sword. >> [Laughs] Melvin, what are those numbers look like to you? >> Latitude, longitude, oh okay. >> Exactly. Why don't you go and punch those numbers into your computer and see where they're going to take us. >> Yes sir. >> Where did you get those coordinates? >> From a very, very good friend. [ Music ] >> Alfred. >> I'm Alfred. >> Hello Mr. Alfred. What can I help you with? >> Actually I was hoping that you could help me locate your father, William. >> I don't know exactly where he is. >> Why is that? >> It's complicated. >> All right. Well, thank you for your time, Robert Sinclair. [ Music ] You know you're father is a good man, you should know that. [ Music ] >> Who are you? >> I'm the original homeland security, bitch. [ Music & Noise ] >> Good work. I got it, son. [ Music ] >> Are we expecting company? >> If you want to live, hop in the trunk and come with me. >> Are you threatening us? >> No, dumb ass. I'm saving you. >> Who are they and what did they want? >> Unless you want to find out, I suggest you get in the truck. Look there's a bunch of them and one of me, how do you like your odds? >> I think we should go with him. Get the gear. >> Who's that? >> That's my son, Jaisac. He's going to slow those guys down. >> Renee, we've got hostile. Grab the gear and the others. Get them back to town. If they follow you, call the police. Wait for my call. >> Hey, the sword, you're going to want to bring that. >> Who are you? >> I can tell you and that nice sword later. Get in the back. [ Music & Noise ] [ Noise ] >> You want to tell us what that was all about? >> Robert. That's hardly the way to speak to someone who just saved our lives. You should apologize. >> What the hell do you know about apologies? >> My name is Joe. >> Yeah, Indian Joe. Keep it Joe to yourself or I'll stub you in the neck. >> Mr. Joe, we saw you watching us earlier. Are we on your land? >> No, I live in a shitty canoe downtown. I was asked to keep an eye on you. >> You are Anasazi, aren't you? >> Well, if you want to be racist about it. >> Excuse me? >> Anasazi is a name the Navajos gave us. It means ancient enemies. We never call ourselves Anasazi. >> Well, what would you call yourself back then? >> The people. >> Creative. What do you call yourself now? >> Anasazi. >> By the way. Why is there an Anasazi site over here so far from Mesa Verde? >> We had to move. >> Why? Do you need better hunting grounds? >> No, the Navajos kept kicking our asses. So before we were completely wiped out, we moved west. >> How does an Anasazi dig site end up in new territory with a European coffin in it? >> I'll tell you but you won't like it. >> What makes you say that? >> Because you have that arrogant, I'm right and everybody else is wrong. And I'm angry because somebody pissed in my corn flakes, what about you? >> Why did they want your skills for? There are no good dwellings around here? >> [Background Music] Our legend starts as our people settled down for winter in that valley. [ Music ] The village was facing certain annihilation-- [ Music ] -- when something remarkable happened. The strange warriors asked us if we were the builders for the cities and cliffs. We said, we were, they offered their protection in exchange for the use of our skills. >> This is ridiculous. This is like something he would make up. >> You have to be a bit more respectful towards your father. You're going to need him before all this is over. >> I haven't needed him for 15 years. >> Maybe not, dumb ass. But he's right about the find. >> You mean to tell me that Knights Templar sailed over the Atlantic in the 13th century, crossed nearly the entire North American continent just to end up in some hellhole of a desert and make an alliance with a nearly extinct tribe simply because they admired their architecture? >> Hey, the truth doesn't require your belief. >> Where is the proof? >> I know enough about you. I know that you can spot a fake. >> I have to do some more testing. >> That's a lot of crap. >> It appears to be authentic. >> Your father was right. The markings on the sword are a map. >> How did you know we thought it was a map? >> Because I'm smart. Now, I believe you will give us a map coordinates. >> How did you know that? >> You don't need coordinates, you need me. [ Music ] >> Whoa, whoa, what are you doing with that? That's dangerous. >> What? Don't you think a little girl like me can handle a sword this big? >> Well, it depends. >> For what? >> Lots of things. Strength, agility, technique, the ability to perform various postures and positions at a very rapid pace. >> How did you get involve with swords? >> My dad. >> Well, I assume that's predictable. >> I suppose. >> You're so passionate about history. These things only natural, he will want instill some of that in you. How old were you when you stopped talking to him? >> I was 15. >> I didn't know him then. I have some difficulties in my life and only he was there for me. I don't know what happened between you two but the William Sinclair that I know has been nothing but kind, understanding, and honest. I've been with him on over a dozen weeks. I don't know what we're dealing with but I know he desperately needs you, we all do. [ Music ] Whatever. >> My parents got divorced when I was 11. They said it was-- they reconciled with differences. They just told us that they needed to live in different places for a while. They sent me out to a bunch of camps. >> Camp, are you a scout? >> No, no, not scout camp. I'm talking real life policy camps. Camps where they taught me Muay Thai, martial arts, and Greek or Roman wrestling. >> That seems strength for a kid. >> I was good. I was really good. >> Your father must have been so proud. [ Music ] >> What's up with you love birds, what are you guys doing, huh? [ Music ] [ Silence ] [Noise] >> You going to want to go about 300 yards up that way. >> What are we looking for? >> You'll know when you see it. >> You're not coming with? >> No, I've got to go pull it down a little bit at Walmart. I hate that shit job. >> Is there anything else we need to know? >> [Background Music] You know Marela [phonetic], you still remember. >> How do you know my real name? No one calls me that. >> You're grandmother did. [ Music ] >> I won't stay here too long if I were you, guys. >> What was that all about? >> My name is Marela, no one ever called me that except my grandmother. She died when I was six. I hardly remember her at all. She used to have this long, beautiful black hair. She used to tell me stories about Indians. I think that's how I became so interested in them. >> Are you okay? >> Yes, I am. >> Okay, let's go. [ Music ] >> This is about 300 yards. [ Music ] >> Alfred. >> Marion, look at this. Have you ever seen a symbol like this before? >> Oh, it-- it appears to be a sword at the Hilton but then the blade terminates in a key. >> A key. The sword is the key? The sword is the key. The sword is the key. And? [Laughter] >> And I have absolutely no idea but the sword is the key, this is remarkable. There has to be more on this. The sword is the key. The sword is the key. Let the light of the blade be your guide. Say it to the Lord. [ Music ] >> There's got to be something right here. Right here. [ Music ] Right. [ Music ] >> What now? >> Step back. [ Music ] Look at that! >> Wow. >> Renee, it's me, we found something. Bring the man in the gear. I'll have Marion send you the coordinates. >> What are you guys waiting for? Come on! Let's go! >> Robert, stay by the sword until we're up there. >> Okay. [ Music ] >> How did it go? >> Everything is fine. [ Music & Noise ] >> What did you find? >> It looks like one of those glasses we saw at the knight's tomb. >> Now what? Is there somewhere to stick the sword? >> It doesn't look like it. >> It's just a rock. >> Hey, dad, you're going to hurt yourself. [noise] What the hell! Oh shit! [ Music & Noise ] >> Kneel. [ Music & Noise ] In Hoc Signo Vinces. [ Music ] Rise, Sir William. [ Music ] >> There's something you should know about me. [Background Music] I'm a member of the Templar Order. >> I thought you said they were all killed or imprisoned? >> I also said that some of them escaped the Great Purge. Some of the men went into hiding. >> How did you come to be involved? >> I was working in Europe with a colleague Alfred De Molay. We were researching, studying Templar lore and eventually he told me that the Templar still existed. He was one of them. He asked me to join. >> De Molay? As in Jacques De Molay? >> Direct descendant. >> Who is Jacques De Molay. >> He was the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar. >> That last known Grand Master. >> And this Alfred De Molay, he's the one who gave you the coordinates to the site? >> He must have discovered it in his research and deciphered the location. >> I don't get it. If he knew the coordinates, how come he didn't tell you everything else? >> Because he was murdered the night that he sent them to me. >> I should've known that this was going to turn you another one of your lies. >> I didn't know! >> You didn't know? You didn't know? Just like you didn't know about the letters that mom was sending me for seven years before she committed suicide?! >> I'm sorry! I was wrong! I was wrong! And I was wrong to keep her from you! >> I think you owe them an apology. >> I may have dragged you into something very, very dangerous. I believed that Alfred De Molay may have been murdered by a member of the Plaga. >> The soldiers sent by the Pope to kill the Templars? >> Any answers we're going to find, we're going to find inside this cave. >> Look, I'm done with this shit. If you care about your lives, I would stay as far away from him as possible. I'm out of here. >> You two head back to the trucks and get the gear. We're going in. [ Music ] >> He abandoned me. He shipped me off to be raised by schools and then he cut me off for my mom. >> He needs you. If you think he's so wrong for leaving you, did you think by you doing the same thing to him is going to make all things better? >> So your friend that was killed sent you a personal message with coordinates in it? So, all they have to do is they got to send message to find out who you are? >> Exactly. >> Is that what you [inaudible] talking at the hotel? >> Houston, we have a problem. [ Music ] >> [Background Music] Everybody into the cave. Now! [ Music ] [Inaudible Remark] >> Get us some pegs and run. [ Music & Noise ] >> About a handful of these are sent to the light. Aw. [ Music ] [Inaudible Remark] >> Adoration. >> [Inaudible] is perfectly shaped for that form. >> So we take them all and put it into [inaudible]. >> And if we choose the wrong one? >> Who knows? [Inaudible Remark] >> What do you think, Professor? >> I don't know. [Foreign Language] >> What? I don't know, there's something written in Latin over here. >> Where? >> Right on this pot of gold. [ Music ] >> "Whosoever is merciful to the poor lendeth to the Lord: the Lord shall repay." >> The beggar. >> Exactly. >> Shit! >> We don't have much time. >> Yeah. I got this. [ Music & Noise ] >> Hurry up. [ Music & Noise ] >> Somebody has to put the ball back on the pillar. >> I'll do it! >> No! >> I said I'll do it. >> No! >> Renee! Renee! No! [ Music & Noise ] [ Noise ] >> Renee? >> No. [ Noise ] [ Music ] >> [Background Music] Dad, you got to keep moving. [ Music ] >> There's no way out of here. >> There's got to be something. [Inaudible Remark] >> Curiosity, generosity. >> Two of the six tests of the Templars. [ Music ] >> Hey dad! What do you think of this? >> Looks like someone was pulled into the wall. >> Professor, come look at this. >> Maybe there's some trick here like the last escape. >> Melvin! >> Look at the markings on this floor. Clearly, someone was here before us. They probably saw everything that we've seen and then crossed this panel. >> I know I'm not touching anything. [ Music ] >> We have to make a choice. >> And which one? >> That's kind of gay. What? It's two dudes on the same horse. You can't tell me that's not a real fruity. >> That's it. >> What? They're gay? >> Two Knights on the same horse. It's a Templar symbol. >> Why is that? >> In the early days they were very poor so it's a reference to that, and to their central purpose of helping others in need. [ Music ] >> Dad, don't. >> I want to do this. This is our only way out of here. Besides, if I'm wrong, you're their only hope of survival. Son, don't forget to say your prayers. [Noise] >> Professor Sinclair, you're the man! Let's go! [ Music ] >> Melvin! [ Music ] >> What now? [Inaudible Remark] I'm not as familiar with this one. Maybe strength to fight? >> [Inaudible], it's the last test of the Templars. >> So we're being tested? What's the trick? How do we get out of this one? >> There's no trick. There's no mystery to solve, there's no riddles to figure out. [ Music & Noise ] >> You come any closer and I'll cut you down. >> You have no right to wield that sword, boy. >> I know that voice. Alfonso! Alfonso! [ Music & Noise ] >> Dean Castillo. >> Why? >> My ancestors stay true to the mother church while yours betrayed and perverted her ways, Templar. >> How long have you known? [ Music ] You killed Alfred. >> He was a heretic. >> Alfred was a Knight Templar, so am I. [ Music ] [ Foreign Language ] [ Music ] >> Your mother church is a whore. [ Music & Noise ] Sinclair! [ Music & Noise ] You disappoint me. >> Heretic. [ Music & Noise ] >> He's gone. >> My God, have mercy on his soul. [ Music & Noise ] >> Ah, you guys! >> Let's go! Come on! [ Noise ] [ Music ] >> [Background Music] Yes! [Inaudible Remark] [ Music ] >> Welcome Professor. >> Thank you. >> Please follow me. >> I had wished that our first meeting would've been more peaceful brother William. But I am glad you are still alive. >> These are my favorites. >> Yes, I know. Alfred was my brother. My name is Phillipe De Molay. I oversee the operations of the Order here. This facility is the hidden center of the Templar Order for many centuries now, even my own brother knew not my part here. >> Phillipe, I'm afraid my involvement with the Order may have contributed to his death. >> Nonsense brother William. It is not unusual for a Templar to pass on what he has learned to one he has deemed worthy of such information. >> What the hell are you doing here? >> Mr. Joe. >> Yeah, big surprise, huh? What? You thought this is the pale-skin-only club? >> No, I just thought you had that crappy job at Walmart. >> Nah, I was just jerking your chain. >> It's the Anasazi. They built this for the Templars, didn't they? >> That's the only [inaudible] we could build casinos, huh? >> Now Joe, be nice to our guests. >> My grandmother was Native American, was she an assassin too? >> You got it. We had to make sure the alliance continued. Your grandmother was a Templar. She wanted you to take her place. >> Robert, you, of course, can see how you were chosen through your father. All of your weapons training was in preparation for you to take his place within the Order. >> Unless you're going to keep being all moody. >> Joe, that's not very nice. >> Yeah, so what? I'm getting out in this moment. It's stinky. >> So, what is the reason for this place? I don't understand. >> Did you know what the purpose of the original Templars was? >> To protect pilgrims en route to holy land? >> After our efforts and the holy land failed, the Order developed a radical plan, a Templar nation. We needed a nation free from the oppression of rule, the ability to change laws without repercussions. It was not long before the Order put a young man by the name of Christopher Columbus on the past of his ideals. >> Columbus was a Templar? >> Do you recognize the banner he had sailed over? >> It bears the Templar cross. >> So, all the stories we hear were arranged to hide the truth that your were setting up your own country? >> [Laughs] Yes. >> But it's America now and you guys are still down here. Why did Templar nation fail? >> My dear boy, who says that we failed? >> Brother, Senator Aldemar [phonetic] is reporting to you. >> Very good. If you please excuse me, I have matters to attend to. I've arranged for transportation for you all back to the village. >> Well, wait, aren't you going to swear to us the secrecy? >> What if we tell other people about this? >> [Laughs] Who would believe you? >> Did she just say Senator Aldemar? [ Music ] >> And so, now he's just going back and forth to Washington, DC. >> So how is it possible, I mean half a dozen men running the whole nation? >> They don't-- they don't actually have to control everything, just give it a little push now and then when things need correcting. >> I think you guys are going to want to see this. >> [Background Music] With a move that shocked the political world, the beloved Senator Aldemar has declared his intention to run for president. Instantly, he has become the favorite as millions backed his banner of political and moral reforms. [Foreign Language] [ Music ] [ Noise ]
