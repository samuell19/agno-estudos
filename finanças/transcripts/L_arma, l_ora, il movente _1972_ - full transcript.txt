"The Weapon, the Hour the Motive" If you do that again, I'll cut your head off. He's destroyed them all. I'm gonna kill him. One of these days I'll kill him. You made me miss my appointment, Satisfied? I've told you so many times, mind your own business. - See? They followed us here. - Let them have the space. Hi. About time. What's wrong'? Are you upset? - Did you bring the Gialli? - No. I didn't have time. Come on, get ready. Roll up your sleeve, I'm in a hurry. I really like mysteries. Who those birds out there? They're for science lessons. - Is air in a syringe dangerous? - Of course, it can kill you. The last doctor hurt me. I'm glad he's gone. Will you stay with me for a while? I can't, I told you. I've got things to do. You're always with George. You never spend time with me. Bye. This lobster is great. Li's from Civitavecchia. Sure, the work situation is bad. - Especially for skilled trades - No, thanks. It's too spicy. - Of course: it's Julia's sauce. - But it's your recipe! - What star sign are you? - Scorpio, I believe... - We're drowning in astrology! - It's become an obsession... - Is that right, Don Giorgio'? - Yes, it's true. Forbidden things are always fascinating. - A good reason to be a priest! - Pisani, you're joking. - This work issue is serious. - Quality's better than quantity! - Don Giorgio, are you alright? - I'm just a bit tired. You've had too little work. Teaching has reinvigorated me. The school takes so much time. I am, after all, its pastor. - You were enjoying your studies. - 10 years ago it was double. Since then, it's dropped 50% The Pope is most upset. - Does he weep over it? - Very funny, interrupting me! I read about it yesterday. It's a real disaster. - I see you know a lot. - I know more than you think. - I'm sorry, bull really must go. - Wait, let's toast Aristide. Know what French farmers say? "Priests, Lords and Rivers..." are awkward partners. - We're getting along just fine. - Right, excuse me, I must go. We can't stay up late, Aristide's going to Florence at seven. We must go to the ministry to see the inspector. 15:15? 15:15 is fine. Goodbye again, Engineer. Bye. I think he's a great priest, and so handsome. - He's like an angel. - You're right, he's a saint. Oh! God! What's got in to you? Why did you stop? - Orchidea. I'll never go back. - Are you fed up with me? No, Orchidea, I'm a priest, do you understand? A priest. - You remember this now? - You don't understand me! I've betrayed everyone. The church, myself. Even God. You evil hypocrite! Then God didn't see us before? - Orchidea! - The beach? Together forever? Remember? God understands. He forgives so it's good for you? God doesn't understand. Can't be jealous of God, can I? Tell the truth, I make you sick? You'll pay for this. I may die, but you'll pay. What do you want to know'? Love or business? - Well he deals with business. - Don't let him interfere. - In matters of the heart - Are you saying this? Here's a young man in uniform. A soldier, or a priest? This one here is you. You're both in the same line. I see contrast, great contrast An obstacle. This is your husband, he's far. The cards say he doesn't know. - Does this person love me'? - Yes, The obstacle's is death - Afterwards there's satisfaction - What does that mean? You may separate, It's better. Has he really left you? - What should I care? - Don't suffer over him. You're suffering. I can see. - Well? - Your husband? Forget him, he's back tomorrow Have you told me everything? - Did you really tell her? - Yes. Just as I said. Enough, Orchidea! I did it only because... You will never understand me. You were saving yourself. You didn’t' leave her for me? - Come on, tell me. - No! It's not true... - Not even you have the right! - Very well. Tell me later. Julia, I can't do this! I can't take it anymore. Don't torment yourself. . Don't provoke me. I may leave. - And then? - I'm not like her, you'd pay. Come on, get undressed. Walking around at night? - Welcome, Engineer. - Hi, Pisano. - Pleasant journey? - Yes, thanks. - Let me take it. - No, leave it alone. - Can I give you a lift? - Thanks. Orchidea? Orchidea? - I thought you were sleeping. - I took a pill for my headache. Your usual headache that never goes away, right? - Goodnight, Aristide. - I had a tough day in Florence. - I don't know what to do. - I know exactly what to do. Please, not tonight. Let's lake him next door. We must call the Police, Unfortunately. Where's the body? In the sacristy. Commissioner. You mean you moved it? Or have I misunderstood? - Did he live here? - No, he just taught music. He had a room in town. What was he doing here? Praying. He often came as he was busy during the day. I'm Father DeRossis, I was sent by the vicarage. If I can help? - Where did you find the body? - over here. Anselmo found it. - Who is this Anselmo? - A caretaker. Shall I call him? - How did you find it? - On the stool, his back to us… I want to know the position! Father, lie down over here. - Was he playing then? - Yes I think so. You think? Have you got any idea? Let's try and reconstruct this scene. Let's get to work. Was he lying like that? Are you certain? - I think so. - Wasn't it more to the right? Yes! - To the left? Where was it? - Ah! Like that. That looks perfect to me. - Where is the Sacristy'? - Next door. You stay there, and don't move. He was struck with a sharp instrument in the shoulder... He died instantly, this explains him falling on his back The impact was from top to bottom, he was still seated. - What time did he die? - Between eleven and one. We'll know after the autopsy. There's one thing I don't get? Look here, around the wounds, there are fragments of wax. - Wax... Wax from a candle? - Look at the skin, whip marks. - The assassin whipped him first? - No, these marks are older. - Ms. Durantini has arrived. - Go to the church, keep at it. - Look for what? - The murder weapon perhaps? - A knife! One covered in wax? - Hey, I'm looking! - Ms. Durantini? - Yes. Orchidea? An unusual name. Please sit down. I'm Commissioner Voight. You know this place well? Yes, my husband and I live next door. We help out. - I've been here for a year. - How well did you know him? We often worked together. I can't believe he's dead. In what way? Well... like that; murdered! Right. They told me you met him yesterday afternoon. I left the ministry at 16:30. I was ill so I came by taxi. I understand. So when did you see him for the last time? Never again. May I? Come on, speak up, there's no secrets round here. I haven't found the knife... but it's there! They told me there was an old knife in the church. It should be covered in wax. Anselmo used it for candles. It's vanished. But I found this. - What is it'? - A marble, under a bench. It's a beauty. I used to play with these as a kid. - Please excuse me a moment. - As you wish, Commissioner. Where's the knife? - I keep it here, to cut candles. - Where is it, then? - How do I know? - Is it your knife or not'? Yes. It's mine, yes. You didn't hear a thing then? -No, I slept till morning. You sleep like a log, Morriconi, take him next door. Ferruccio, come here. - Stay still. - No... No! - Where has he been hiding? - No! I'm scared. Ferruccio, calm down. God, has nobody thought about him? Suddenly finding himself all alone here. Poor boy. - Who is he? - The nuns have adopted him. Poor boy. This was his room. Poor Don. Giorgio. What a mess! Sorry, Sister. Come on Morriconi, to work. - Did Don. Giorgio have enemies? - Doctor! Someone’s been here. Yes, I know. I've seen it. Note it down... Well then? - Enemies? No, I don't think so. - Right, everyone liked him. - Even you? - Yes, yes. Of course... - Like a brother. - Of course, of course. Why did he whip himself? Your penitence ritual? - I don't know if I'll answer that. - I'll take out the shame... you have to. Well, then? No, I don't think so. Blessed are those who can. A man who castigates himself doesn't have a clear mind. You're wrong. We all sin, so we must suffer for this. He was a Saint. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to pray for him. Go. Go on. Sister, while you're there, say a prayer for the assassin. - I'd bring them all in. - Morriconi... - Going out? - Yes, Ferruccio isn't well. Feruccio cries, you go running. Damn! Your name's there. - So? Your name's there too? - If I were you I'd stay away. Why? I've done nothing wrong. - No. I don't want the injection. - Don't be stubborn. Come on, roll up your sleeve. No, it must stay as it was. We need to keep the structure What are you doing here? He's being naughty, he doesn't want to have his injection. Don't hide and don't tell lies. Now, for penitence, recital. Orchidea Durantini... Her husband, an engineer He's level headed, religious. She worked in a college near the convent with him. She was asleep. He was on the 01:00 train from Firenze There, that's Pisani, he went to get him from the station. - That's all, Prosecutor. - It doesn't seem like much? - The investigation's just begun. - Keep me informed. Excuse me, Doctor, can you rewind it? Isn't that Barsetti? Right, Barsetti. 15 for homicide. He got out in the amnesty... Precisely! - An ex-con and you kept quiet? - Tell them everything... He is a good man. Since Don. Giorgio scolded him he's okay. A heavy-drinking ex-con? And you say he's a good man? - You asked for me? - Some questions, okay? - No, of course not. - Sister, take her place in class. You have an essay to write. Take out your pens and books. Have you got my pen? “Memories of Don. Giorgio” - Why didn't you tell me before? - I didn't think it important. Even Don. Giorgio could never believe he'd hurt him. I was scared! He was shouting his pitchfork held up. - Both of you or just him? - He ran up to us in his car. It was Don. Giorgio's side. - He didn't like him'! - He was always polite to me. Good... Good, Good, Good! - You think he was responsible? - No, I can't say that yet. Madam. Everything on the floor. Yes, yes, Sister. Be careful or you'll slip. Here he is... Sorry! I didn't see a thing! Let go, I haven't done anything! Yes, I changed my name but... Keep walking, or else! Enough. Let go of me! Son's of bitc... Come on. What have I done? I don't want to go back inside. Ferruccio, come here. I made them write an essay. Where is he? He could've spared them this sight. I don't know, he was here a moment ago. We need to have a talk You and I. It's all as it as it was. Death's terrible, but he sees you. He wouldn't want you to be like this. Give me a smile. - I'll slay close now he's gone. - Of course, my dear. I have something of yours? Do you want to see it? - It's yours isn't it? - No. - Don't lie? You'll confess. - Good morning. - How's the little boy? - I thought you left with him No hurry. I'll see to him later. So, feeling better today? - Don. Giorgio's death upset him. - A homicide without sense... then someone arrests a crazy old guy and they start talking. I liked him as a friend. He made my work easier. - Why do you do this? - Talking to a policeman is hard You need to be precise, They seem to know everything... - I'm off duty now, though. - Then it's even more dangerous. If someone is in danger here, then it's me! - Really? Please, don't go yet. - No, I really have to go... My husband's waiting for dinner He supports my schoolwork but Can I see you when I want? I just have to call you in for an interrogation. - Isn't that an abuse of power? - it is! - You seem transformed. - I like to be comfortable. As long as I'm not causing a scandal. - You've broken so many laws. - The most serious, seeing you. - But I'm not married. - I am! Anyone here? Good morning, Madam. Can we get something to eat? - Of course, come this way. - Thanks. “Traveler repose and dream among my leaves” Only one table? Must be ours. No doubt. It's very strange here, quite fascinating. Like you. - Thank you, Commissioner - My name's Franco. - Why are you so quiet? - it's like the first time. - The same emotion. - I also see something new - I have a son in Tahiti. - In Tahiti? No... In Daiti. This must stop. Who said you could do that? Get ready. If I don't want it you shouldn't do it, you should be nicer. I do it for your own good. Well then? Come on. No! I don't want to. I don't want to! No! - Leave it, I'll do it. - Careful, you can cut yourself. What an impression you made! Afraid of injections. Why do you upset Orchidea so? What's is it? Don't like her? I like her, but if she gives me injections I don't! - Affection has a price. Hear it? - Yes, I heard... He should be left alone here. Come on, it's late and you still need to get dressed. - The marble, did you take it? - Yes, I want to give it him. - Do you like it? - Go on take it, don't be shy. - This lobster is delicious. - it's from Civitavecchia. - Try my sauce. - With pleasure. Looks great, I like spicy food. - It's Julia's specialty. - But it's from your recipe. - In this heat. - Yes, it's true and it's Autumn. - He has a strong stomach - You like it, I see... In my work I've a weak stomach. They reform for the Sisters. Especially in the summer. - Julia's cards don't ever tally. - Such an adventurous life. Yes, a long series of successes. And there's also a lover. - A great love. - That's enough, thank you. Engineer, are you tempted? I'd like to know your secrets My life isn't so interesting. I don't care for the future... - and I don't have secrets. - Want me to read your cards? I would be most inclined. What's this? - “Leviticus 18:20’ Biblical. - Certainly. - Why is it here? It's mysterious. - It was in Don Giorgio's room. Do you know what it means? - You know the Bible by heart - But what does it mean? Well... Mother'? “Don't fornicate with your friends wife. This is the word of the Lord. - Is this Don Giorgio's writing? - I... wouldn't know. Thanks. Ferruccio's asleep, I must go to the convent. Coming with me? - All done, he's asleep. - Well, Goodbye. - What are you thinking about? - That note. It's strange. - It's like it was written for us. - Seemed like it, but it wasn't. Better like that. I love you Franco. - What's wrong? - Nothing. You knew him well. Do you think he could've had a lover? - Who? - Don Giorgio. - Yes, he could have. - And you? - Would you've slept with him? - Me? He's not my type. My only lover is Ferruccio. He can be very jealous. - What are you doing? - I'm taking it down. - Are they changing it? - They're closing down. - Since when? - They died in an accident. - Who comes here? - Nobody, just some couples. - What was the manager’s name? - Me? I'm not from around here. You a SPY? - Don't be cheeky, is it open? - it's open! Want some help? - No, stay where you are. - I'm finished here anyway. Morriconi... Get the fuck out of here! What're you doing? Wait, I can’t run. My side is hurting. - Can I see this letter? - Here it is. “Go to Val Sia Rosa Restaurant, Don. Giorgio went there.” As I said. It was hard to find this place! - You could've just asked me? - You weren't around! Answer me this; how did you know about the restaurant? Maybe it was me who sent that anonymous letter? Where do we go now? - I'm going to the convent. - You stay away from me! - Thanks, I've finished. - Have you discovered anything? Yes, such as, who put the note in Don. Giorgio's diary. - Who? - You. There's another note that mentions a strange restaurant. I wrote it. With the biblical verse, I tried to save his soul I will cry forever, Such an innocent life. Don Giorgio tried to destroy it but I found them. It leaves no doubt. That's why I hid it. Read it! It’s full of insults and attacks of particular times. That's how I knew about the restaurant. There's more at stake now. Even the angels say so. “A scandal may be necessary.” In the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost Accept our penitence in Don Giorgio's name. You're useless at this. - Do you still want to play? - No point, you're better. - Doctor, they've finished. - Can't you see I'm busy? Call me when he arrives. - That woman's dead isn't she? - Don't think about it. - Listen, let's make a deal. - With what? I'll give you all these, right? And you give me that one. No, I like this one. - I'll see Orchidea, she has lots. - Right? They don't sell these - No? Where can I get one? - Did you lose it in the church'? - I'm going, I've got homework. - It's 10:30. - Let me see... - Why don't you put it back? - it's automatic, I can't. He used to change it for me. He died the day it went back. Daylight saving? What an idiot! Morriconi. Morriconi! What'll I tell the Prosecutor? He wants the report on Pisani. Killed between 24:00 -1:00 Instead of 23:00 -1:00 Who the hell cares? Daylight saving hours or not... - Whoever had an alibi still has. - it boils down to a 'dead hour' A “dead hour”. - What “dead hour”? - Of course, at midnight... I've never fully understood it. Everything stops for an hour. - Trains stop. Like it don't exist. - Get me their statements. The motive is there, but the alibi? Maybe not anymore. Yes? One moment. It's Durantini. - Why are you here so late? - And you? What are you doing? Praying for Don. Giorgio's suffering, listening to music. I understand. Good. Good. Pray some more, continue. Commissioner Voight? I've called three times. Can you tell me when? I understand. Thank you. When Don. Giorgio was killed, you were travelling? - That's right. - Right, on a train. Unless… The train wasn't moving? You didn't tell us this before. - Yes, sorry. It stopped an hour. - Where? - I couldn't say. The mountains? - I'll tell you where... - 20 min. walk from the church - What does that mean? You had time to get off and kill poor Don Giorgio. - And return to the train. - What was my motive? That's what I want to know. Why would you slab him? Don Giorgio was a friend. He would visit us at home. He and my wife were close. - Have an alibi for Giulia Pisani? - What is this Commissioner? Do you really think I? Whoever killed him also killed Giulia Pisani, logic. She was killed for an envelope that should've contained... 100,000 L. Blackmail money. Only, it didn't contain any cash The assassin waited. The murderer was in such a hurry they forgot it. Engineer, you're a suspect. You'll get a letter tomorrow. Thanks, you can go. You're mistaken. What are you staring at'? You never seen me before? No, I just don't understand. It's been like this for a bit. Remember; The weapon, the hour and the motive. Here, it's the ignorant mule, and the Godless soul. - Well, found something? - Nothing interesting. Engineer Durantini often came here to play cards, right? Maybe, I wasn't at home much. Poor Giulia... She always said people liked her. She couldn't see her future Who could have killed her'? - Hello? - Orchidea? Orchidea. - Ah! It's you. - Listen to me. - Where are you calling from? - I'm at the office, going crazy! - What's happened? - I've spent all day in custody… They think I killed them, understand? Come quickly! Hello? Hello? This is the sun, the demon... These cards belonged to Giulia. - But there's one card missing. - Which one? “Justice” is missing. Hello? Yes, it's me. What? I'm on my way. Get a car sent for you. You're authority there. Sell that bike! Yeah... Goodbye, mother. He's locked himself in and he's not responding. - Morriconi. - Cartillo. Good. - Call the medical officer. - Yes Sir. Alert the Magistrate and get forensics here. Morriconi, one moment... - try this in the door. - Yes, straight away. Does it work? - It works. He locked himself in. - it's your fault, he was upset. - I spoke to him soon after. - No, don't blame us for this. Now leave, go next door to the other room. He jealously guarded his office so he had a special lock made. Any more of these? Maybe the secretary? Or you, Pisani? - No, absolutely not, just his. - This one doesn't open, Doctor. - Well? - Suicide. It seems evident. - Shall I break it? - Calm down, Morriconi. Don't let your enthusiasm carry you away, Morriconi. It's open. Here we are! The missing card: “Justice”! What does it mean? I'll explain later. And here is the knife. This was used to kill Don. Giorgio and Giulia Pisani. You know, for a while, I thought you were the murderer Why didn't you tell me of your relationship with Don. Giorgio? Did you think I wouldn't understand? You really think I'm... Please, don't punish me. I need your loving. The discovery of a knife in Durantini's draw proves it. We have proof that Giulia Pisani was blackmailing him. What do you think it was that pushed Mr. Durantini, to do this? Jealousy. An absurd jealousy that blurred his reality. In his mind he formed an idea that his wife had betrayed him. - The first victim Don. Giorgio. - Therein lies the absurdity. Between her and her colleague it was a normal friendship. Like collaborators. Testimonies show this. It was his jealousy. - It made him lose reality. - You mean he went mad? - There's no other explanation. - Thanks, Commissioner Voight. We conclude this pan of our transmission. Hello? - Did you see it? - I just turned off the TV. - Are you coming over? - You got something to say? - About what? - Was I good? - Yes, of course! - I even told a lie. You can tell me the truth. How could you say I slept with him? - I did it for you. - Thanks, It's better this way. - For me it's a closed chapter. - I wish it was like that for me. You're starting again! You said we wouldn't talk about it. - If you love me, forget him. - You know I love you. Essay Title: “Memories of Don. Giorgio” - Come to take me out? - Yes, if you want. But first, I want to talk.
