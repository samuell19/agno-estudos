Friendships in New York are like encounters on a bus. You might hit it off right away, but only if you're lucky, you also get off at the same stop. New York, the famous melting pot. Here are some of the young and beautiful that found their way to the city. Posting their saturated Brooklyn lives on Instagram, attracting even more from all over the world. All looking for love, happiness and success. Just like the two women we're about to meet, Maria and Lena. I just don't know. This whole new development, every single guy I hang out with, they just want to have kids like immediately. Well, take it as a compliment. I mean they see this big pile of amazing genes bundled up in this cute little package of yours and they wanna snatch it away. Haha, but it's actually very frustrating because I don't even think it's about me, you know? It's about them. I mean look at James, he adores you, and not the idea of you being with him, know what I mean? Well, adore us as much as you like. I don't know, maybe he's just too old. Oh, yeah, we don't do old. They're wrinkly and smelly and they go like Yeah, tell me about it. Should we get going? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think we should. - Yeah, let's get... - Oh my God, the guy's already sitting in front of your door. Well, maybe. No, no, it's on me. Come on. No, no, no, my treat. That's a really cute bracelet, it really suits you. Yes, you like it? - Yeah. - Wanna try it on? Thank you. - It's very nice. - You can keep it. - No, come on. - Yes, my treat. This is very expensive. I have like five of them, it's yours. Thank you. Did you ever see this picture on Facebook that looks like a roschach but also like an old lady? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that like thing that if you squint your eyes, you might see an old lady or a princess or something? Or, yeah, or a chichi. A chichi, that's your word for it? Chichi or hooha. - Well, I don't know... - Come on, check it out. - I wanna show you. - Okay, I'm gonna pull it up. There, there, you see? - Oh my God! - Totally. Oh my God, you're so right! It's totally a chichi, well that's good to know. Why? Well, next time a guy goes down on you and he squints his eyes, he might discover a princess? Yeah, speaking of which, I gotta go. Alright, bye, have fun. - Bye. - Bye. Lena and Maria were best friends, that kind of close friendship in your early 30's when all your real best friends have become childhood memories. They met at a charity event where Maria was part of the catering group. Realizing that they were both European was a great conversation starter. Unfortunately, it also got Maria fired. Hey. You're home early. Yeah. Did you guys have fun? Yeah. Looks like you had fun, huh? What? Oh, yeah, they just left. They? I just, I just saw her. I just saw her. What? I just saw that woman leave our house. No, remember, I told you about this. I was having a friend over for a drink? You know, it's just a colleague from work. We talked about this, remember? Hey, it's fine, hey, come here. Oh my God, you even smell like her. Oh shit, oh shit! - Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. - What are you doing? I'm looking! Looking for what? I don't know! Lena, you're being ridiculous! So, is this like a one time thing or has this been going on for a while? What? Listen, you are really stressed out, Lena, okay? Don't put this on me. No, listen, I'm not trying to put it on you. All I'm trying to say is that we're both working through a lot of problems right now and just... That's not an excuse! Listen, let's just, can we please sit down and talk? Please? - Please, can we just... - Don't fucking touch me! Okay, fine. I'm leaving. Fine. Go. Go. Lena! Fuck. - Strawberry? - Nm-nm. Come on. - Just one. - No, no. Just a strawberry. Can't you see I'm smoking? Yes, I can see that. Didn't you say you wanted to quit anyway? Well, I've changed my mind. Again, and again, and again, always changing your mind. That's what I'm talking about. You can't commit to anything. Man, what's your problem? We're having great sex, we're having fun, I don't want anything of you, you should be happy. Yes, but I'm not happy. Why? Look, - you're 30 years old... - I'm 29. Okay, almost 30. Do you know what that means, hm? You're on your best years, don't waste them around. You should have a baby. - A baby? - Yeah. No. Don't you want to have a baby with me? No, I don't want a baby, no babies. Wow, women of your generation. What is wrong with my generation? The problem is you can't commit to anything. Okay, in a perfect world, what's an ideal woman for you? - You're asking? - Mm-hm. Okay. I would like a woman that bakes a strawberry pie in the morning, gives me a blowjob in the night. You're disgusting, - that's absolutely disgusting. - Come on, I was kidding. - Come on, I was joking! - No, you're disgusting, - that's not even funny. - I was joking about - the strawberry pie. - No, you know what? Just leave, okay? - What's wrong? - Just leave, go away. - No, I want you out. - Come on, come on. No, no, leave, leave, I want you to leave. - Are you serious? - Go, leave, yes, I'm serious, leave. - Go! - Okay, I'm going. As much as Maria had enough of men explaining her life, Lena had enough of her marriage. She wasn't sure what she had seen or if she had seen anything at all. Her decision to leave made her sad, but not sad enough. This is Kings Highway. And her confusion lead her to Maria's place. Do you think this has been going on for a long time? I mean, I don't know. I had a strange feeling lately, we had some problems, but... I don't know. I am so sorry. I mean, James, who would have thought? He was always so concerned about you. But then again, I've only met him a couple of times anyway. What an ass. Wanna sleep over tonight? No, thank you, I don't think I can sleep right now. Do you want some wine? I could use a glass of wine. I had a pretty fucked up date myself, actually. Oh my God, you, I totally forgot, your guy was here. - I'm sorry, I can, I can... - Why are you sorry? No, no, no, stop it. Relax, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna have a party. That's it, we're gonna have a party, my roommates are not here, so, we could have some booze and something to smoke, - we could have fun. - I don't know. That's what we're gonna do, and it's gonna be great. I'll take care of it. This was Maria's typical way of handling a crisis. And Lena, Lena didn't mind at all. Morning. Good morning. Fuck. Shoes. Let's go. So, what are you gonna do now? I don't know, I mean, right now I feel really hungover so I don't really wanna wrap my head around it. Are you getting a divorce? Wow, um... I don't even know what happens to my visa then, so. Oh shit, yeah, that's true, you can't get a divorce. At least you can keep the house. No, he can stay at the apartment, - I don't care about it. - What, are you crazy? First of all, it's an awesome apartment, and second of all, darling, you know I love you but you can't stay in my shit hole forever, you gotta get the apartment. You know, I know it sounds strange, but, the apartment, all of it, never made me happy. That's bullshit, we can redecorate. He's the one who cheated on you, he has to give you the apartment. You gotta conquer that castle! What? Conquer the castle. Maria, I don't think that's an expression. Doesn't matter, this asshole has to go. I'm gonna conquer that castle, watch me. Oh my God, Maria, you're crazy. Where were you? I was worried all night. I don't think you care. Lena, of course I care. You shitbag! What is she doing here? We conquered the castle! What? Well, I think it's better if you leave for a while. For a while? Better forever, you fucking cheater. Lena, can we talk about this in private? I don't think I can talk to you right now. See? Just pack your shit and go. I already packed my bags, you can shut up. Listen, maybe we both need just some time to figure this out. I also need a break. Okay. Okay. So, I'm gonna leave if that's what you want. Okay. See you in a week. Wow, that was easy. What now? What are you doing? I'm gonna burn his fucking clothes! Fuck, fuck. Come on, come on, come on, come on. - Yes, there we go. - That's not gonna work. Yeah, it's gonna work, you see? There you go, there you go, oh, oh! Fuck, fuck! Fuck, oh my God. Just leave them here. Okay. The pathetic attempt of burning her husband's clothes didn't satisfy Lena's need of destruction. James' decision to leave even caused a brief flickering or doubt. As the cold water ran over her body, doubt became fear. Lena? Yeah? Can I wear this dress? Sure, just give me two minutes, I'll be there. Okay. Maria suggested a night out and Lena gladly tagged along. Maria had always considered the attention of men to be reassuring. As long as she had her youth, and her presence and her beauty, she would always get by. Lena was more reserved in that matter, but tried to follow her lead. What are you doing? You're still wearing your wedding ring? Yeah. I thought you wanted to have fun tonight. I'm having fun, I'm dancing! Take it off. I, I don't wanna lose it, come on. I thought you didn't care about money. I don't. Come on, I'll fix it. One, this would work. - Alright, another round? - Sure. Maria and Lena felt closer than ever before. Hours went by, lost. But all that seemed to matter now were the possibilities of the moment. "Follow your heart, and you may shine." What the fuck does it even mean? I have no idea, what does yours say? "The path to everything is love." Oh, God! Well, yeah, right. By the way, I had this really weird dream last night. I dreamt like either I was wearing a wig, or, I had just black hair, I don't know. Well, I think... I was you, if that makes any sense. That's a very interesting dream. Yeah. Oh, shit, I gotta go. - I'm late for work. - No! - Yeah. - No, don't leave me. Don't, no, quit your job and stay with me here, please. Shut up. Guys, where's my steak frites? Enjoy. Maria, a word, please? Of course. Listen, when you're on the floor, you need to smile. We sell food here, good makes people happy, right? - Yeah, okay. - Do you like working here? Yeah, I do, I do. From what I understand, you need this job. No other fine dining establishment is gonna hire you, so please, adjust your attitude. - Okay. - So, let me see it. Alright. While Maria was dealing with an irrational boss and the stress of making a living, Lena sat at home wondering about mortality. She had always been fascinated about life's vulnerability. A fascination that could quickly turn into obsession. Especially when there's not much else to do. Bones. Skin, and bones. Blood. White blood cells. Inflammation. Hives, pox? Chicken pox. Meningitis. Castleman disease. Crest disease, lyme disease. Poems syndrome. Liver failure. Kidney failure. Congenital heart block. Lina? Lina? Lina! Um, it's actually Leh-na. The doctor's ready for you now. The doctor will be right with you. Lena had seen Dr. Hollis for a while now. He was kind and patient, and didn't seem to mind that she visited him often. Especially after last year's incident of bleeding out a cluster of cells that had formed a fetus inside of her. Hi, Lena. - Hi, Doctor Hollis. - What's going on? Um, I just feel all drained of energy. I have these headaches, like right here and sometimes up here. I just don't feel that good. How long has that been happening? Um, maybe two months? Yeah. Okay, let's take a look at you. That looks good. Look to your left, let's see. Well, you look good to me, I mean, we can have the nurse draw some blood, see if there's any deficiencies, but other than that, you look fine. Okay, yeah, yeah, let's do that. Okay. Their new living situation has soon enough provided a consoling pattern which tightened their friendship. Waking up together in the morning and going out together at night. Today, it was Maria whose emotions were in turmoil. Not only was her boss a pain in the ass, but her ex-lover had also tried to call her several times. My boss, he's so sleazy, he's so annoying, he gets on my nerves all the time. Ugh, I wish I could do something about it, but, he's gonna have me deported. I'm sorry. Yeah. Maybe I should marry an American just like you did. Well, we saw how that goes. Come on, I bet he's calling you all the time. This city's just so beautiful. Is it though? I remember when I was a kid and I came here for the first time on vacation. I just thought the city is so sterile, it doesn't even smell. Are you crazy? New York stinks, everywhere. Must have been a winter holiday. Christmas shopping. You spoiled bitch. Ow! Come with me, I have an idea, come. - Where are you going? - Just come. Are you ready? - Yes. - One, - Two, three. - Two three! One more! Enjoy, ladies. Thank you. Cheers! - Another round? - Sure. Two more. - Fuck. - What? The guy you're hooking up with, he's right over there. - Where? - There. Just ignore him. He's right there, he just saw you. I wanna know more about you. Did you ever have a proper job? Are you serious right now? Yeah, like a proper job, not advertising... - Are we really doing this? - Mm-hm. Oh, um... Actually, um, yeah, I once worked on an assembly line. One summer, when I was 16, my dad wanted my sister and me to experience "the real world," which is hilarious 'cause he's spending all his life in conference rooms. Actually, he wanted us to be lawyers like him, but yeah, so. I wanna know more about the assembly line. Of course. It was not that bad, I mean, the actual labor. The worst part was that they were listening to the same radio station all day long and there were only so many pop songs they played, you know? That, and they talked about soap operas a lot. Poor you. You were once in a soap opera, weren't you? Yes, yes, I was. What was that name again? - And that means? - Heart On Fire. - Oh my God. - Yeah. Oh, fuck they're coming over. Good evening, ladies. Hi. Hello. Would it be cool if we joined you? Sure, hi, my name is Lena. - Rick. - Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Palo. - Hi, Lena. - I'm Maria. - Maria. - Maria, nice to meet you. What are you guys drinking? We had shots. Yeah, you care for another one? - Sure. - Yeah. What are you drinking? - Vodka? - Sure, alright. Could we have four more please? Lena woke up alone. Neither James nor Maria were there. The apartment was awfully quiet and she felt rather small and unimportant. When she closed on eye, and then the other, per perspective would shift. At least one thing offered her some comfort. Lena thought of her childhood and how things were a little better then. Lina? Lina? Lina! It's still Leh-na. Okay. - Hi, Lena. - Hi, Dr. Hollis. Your blood work is not in yet, is there anything else I can do for you? Um... Uh, yeah, okay, um... Maria had a stressful morning. Her ex-lover, Palo, had left her several angry and condescending messages the night before. And even though she liked his passion, she disliked the ownership he took over her. Can I get you anything else? - Maria, what's up? - Hi. How are you? That's a cute outfit today, I love it. - Thank you. - Is this 100% cotton, because myself, I'm a cotton man, I love 100% cotton, that's all I wear, - you know? - Okay, I'm really busy, Bill, - bye. - Alright, see ya. Hello, may I take your order? Surprise. What are you doing here? - Quit your job. - I can't. Yes, you gotta quit your job. Shut up, I told you, I can't. What do you want? Well then, I'll have the lobster salad, please. - Are you serious? - Chop, chop. I'm gonna spit in your salad. Both feeling rather unhappy by themselves and only happy together, Maria and Lena decided to make Lena's dream come true. They decided to become the other person. At least for one night. "Content is happiness. Happiness is content." Okay. That's interesting. "What's meant to be will always find a way." Hm. And it's interesting I get that today. Why? I have an audition tomorrow. Oh my God, that's great! Yeah, yeah, I know. What is it for? It's for a space film. - Cool! - Yeah. Congratulations. Thank you, I mean, I didn't get it yet, but, you know, it'll work out. Cool, I'm happy for you. But you promised, you promised you would stay with me forever, fuck. Maria had the feeling that this was finally the opportunity she had been waiting for. There was a better version of herself out there, and she was close to becoming it, if she could only find a way to calm her nerves. But you promised. You promised you would never leave me. You promised you would stay with me forever in the outer realm space... Fuck! Space station. Space station, space station. Space station. No, no, no, outer realm space station. But you promised, you promised you would never leave me. You promised you would stay with me forever in the outer realm space station, this is, who the fuck wrote this? But you promised, you promised you would never leave me. Fuck. Lena! I've got nothing to wear! I mean, look, this could work, no? Wow. It's futuristic and feminine. What was the role description again? A space steward determined, by sensual. Well, this is totally determined but sensual. I know, but, you know, it's too expensive, I can't. Oh, no, I want you to wear it. Come on, you can even keep it if you want. Thank you. And do you need any accessories, any jewelry? Yeah, but that's, you know, too much Not at all, just have a look, I got plenty. Okay, thank you! Wow, this is, this is perfect! And there's like this necklace, maybe? Oh, sure. Yep! While Lena was happy to have helped Maria, she had her own business to tend to. Lina? Hm... Your blood work came back, it looks great. It's normal, everything is wonderful. You're healthy, just keep trying. Maybe I'm not the right doctor for you. Oh, really? You know what? Forget about this, fuck this. That evening, both Lena and Maria seemed awfully tense. Want more wine? Who are you texting with? Don't worry, it's not your husband. - Ouch. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, it's just this audition, I'm so stressed about it and the lines are so bad. If you want, I can't rehearse with you. No, no, actually, I'd rather go to bed, I'm sorry. Good night. Hm, "Fall in love with your life." Gotta go, gotta go to my audition. Okay, good luck, break a leg, huh? See ya later. Maria, we're ready for you. Okay, let's start with the slate, what's your name? My name is Maria Kalitsi. Hi, Maria, how tall are you? I'm five foot six. Okay, I'd like to see your profile, can you turn to the left, please? Lovely, and to the right? Okay, fantastic, let's jump right in, are you ready? I'm ready. And action. But, you promised me. You promised you would stay forever with me in the outer realm space station. But that was before everything happened. I don't think I love you anymore. Okay, thank you. Maria, there's one more thing. You know this love scene, the one where you're supposed to be giving the BJ? Yeah? The director would like to know if you could show him what you would do. So, here's a prop. What do you mean? Uh, just, you know, if you could like show us with the bottle what you would do. Are you serious? Just hold it up towards your mouth. While Maria was auditioning, Lena had time to think. Lena felt that they were both drifting apart and that she wanted to have an honest conversation with Maria. Lena also wanted to come clean, and tell Maria what really happened with James. Hey. Hey! - How did it go? - Shit. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure! What happened? Maria! Hi. Oh, fuck. Um, Maria, um, that's my sister. I am so sorry! In English: Are you two lesbian? You and my sister, are you lovers? Julia! I'm sorry. Okay, you know what, guys? I better leave you two alone. Maria, you don't have to go, I'm sorry, Maria? Mhm. I am so sorry. While Lena was still contemplating her complicated relationship with her sister, Maria felt like burning down a house or destroying an expensive Chinese vase. Anything would do that could lighten the anger and disappointment she felt growing inside her. So, she first turned to alcohol, and then to sex, two things that had worked out for her in the past. Another round? It's on the house. Sounds tempting, but um... I think I shouldn't. Yeah, I know that feeling. I do serve more than drinks though, you know. Maria stopped at a playground, trying to remember how easy it was when she was a child. But she couldn't. My ball. What, you're not gonna apologize? You just hit me. Where are you manners? You know what? Here's your ball, bye now. Bitch. When they woke up the next morning, they were both still so absorbed in their own troubles that they could not even face each other. Maria, what's up? - Hi. - How you doing? - Good. - You look so great today. I love your hair, are you doing something different with it? - You look fantastic. - Mm-hm, I'm really busy, - I'm so sorry, Bill. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, well, you know, alright, see ya. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You know, you look so familiar to me. Yeah? Yeah, do I know you from somewhere? Um, no, no I don't think so. Are you Greek? Yes, yes, I'm Greek, yeah. Okay, um... You're on that TV show! Yeah, right? Yeah, I used to watch it every summer in Greece with my grandparents, my grandparents are from Kefalonia. Yeah, what are you doing here? Um, I'm working here. Yeah, why are you waiting tables? I moved to New York. - Maria? - Yes? For the last time, you need to be friendly. I am friendly. No, you're a pretty girl. This city is filled with pretty girls. Girls who would love the opportunity to work at my restaurant. Girls who would personally thank me for the opportunity. Personally thank me for the opportunity. Okay, that's it. Come on, Maria, you don't need to... - I quit. - You don't have to do this. Fuck you. Maria, come back, Maria! Hey. Hi. Can I buy you a drink? Sure. No, please, please. - What? - Stop. Did I do something wrong? No, I'm sorry. Please, I can't. What? I'm sorry, I just can't, I can't. Can I at least jerk off on you? Lena! Lena, I quit my job! Lena, Lena! I quit my job! - What? - I quit my... Hi. Oh, are we having a party now? Uh, sorry, I didn't know you had company. Well, actually, he was just about to leave. - Oh. - Oh. - Okay. - Okay. Know what? I think we should go to the Hamptons. - Now? - Yes, now. I know this guy, he has a house. Let's go. Hm. Come on, we need to get out of the city. Okay. That's disgusting, you're disgusting. - Here. - No, no, no! No, show me. Oh, I can't, it'd be like, - no, no, no, I don't... - Are you cold? That's a man horse. No? Come on. I'll do a turtle. - Wait. - Okay, I'm waiting. Maria! Okay, this is it. Maria, what are you doing? - Come on, get up. - What if someone's home? There's no one home, he has like five houses, that's why he used to bring me here all the time. - Are you kidding me? - Come on, it's gonna be fine. - Trust me. - Oh my God. What's going on? Come on. Fuck, the keys, he always leaves the keys. Okay. Maria! Maria! Fuck, fuck. Shit, shit, shit. What? What? Fuck. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, ugh! What? Tada! Did you just break in? Uh, not exactly. Are you bleeding? Eh, not really, come on, come in. Shit. No, I mean, I totally get it, my sister and I, we're just very different, you know? I mean, she likes to please my father and loves her conservative way of life, and... I totally respect that. No, you don't. No, I don't, I'm an asshole. You know what? I actually think she has a crush on James. Perfect timing. I mean, now that her sister is a lesbian. Yeah. Good for her. No, I mean it, maybe we should consider. I mean, I'm having a great time with you, and you're having fun with me, right? Always. See? So... should we, should we, should we do this? Yeah, yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. - Let's do it. - Oh, okay. Let's do it. You're very pretty. You're very pretty also. Thank you. - No. - No, I'm sorry. I'm, yeah, I'm definitely into guys. Being out in the Hamptons seemed to make everything so much easier. Lena swam in the cold water for hours, clearing her head, while Maria was lying in the hot sun thinking of nothing. Oh, it's cold. It's nice, no? Ugh, teenagers. I know. - I hate them. - I get it. They always feel so, invincible. "Remisuri" What? It's an old Bavarian word, meaning the exuberance of children and the absence of parents. That's one word? Yeah, it's pretty good, isn't it? Okay, remi... "Remisuri" "Suri" like the daughter of Tom Cruise. Well, in that case, I'm pretty "remisuri" myself. I think our whole generation is. Yeah, you know, when I was born, my mother named me Maria after Maria Callas. No shit. Yeah, she actually did that. She used to say I was the prettiest girl in the neighborhood. Once my mom told me my beauty's a currency, and that I could actually pay with my beauty. Wow. Yeah, she's amazing. When I was 14, there was this boy that fancied me, and he followed me home. My mom was at work, so, when we got in, he said I was the prettiest girl he had ever seen. He was so nice, so I gave him a blowjob. In the kitchen. My mom was pretty as well, but she got knocked up. She was so proud of me when I got that shitty soap opera. But I wanted to be a real actress, I want to be a real actress, that's why I came to New York. But now, karma fires back. Now, I have to give blowjobs in audition rooms. God, I prefer the one in my kitchen. You know, I was pregnant last year. I lost it. Lena, I'm sorry. I don't even know if I want to put children into this world anyway. I'm so sorry. Oh man, you know what your problem is? What is my problem? Tell me. You have to say that you are an actress before you can be an actress. But, that's not true. No, I mean, you have to say, "Hi, my name is Maria, I'm an actress." But, that's not true, I... I've never been paid for anything I've done, and I haven't worked in such a long time. Oh come on, money's so overrated. That's easy for you to say. But, I'm gonna tell you a little secret. You actually need money to survive in this world, like pay your rent... Really? And go shopping. Shocker, I kind of knew that. That's progress. No, I mean I'm serious, you can't have money define who you are. I mean, listen to me, you can't have money define who you are. 'Cause money... Money makes you lazy. The whole fucking world can crumble around you and you still don't make a move because of all your comfortable money. It's like... It's like comfortable glue. Hm. I used to sniff glue in kindergarten. Well, that explains a lot. Yeah, it probably does. I'm hungry. These are really good. - Mm-hm, more wine? - Yes, please. - Another oyster? - Yeah, thank you. Hey, did you see the captain over there? Yeah, nice hat. Do you think he's peacocking? Well, actually, I think he might be old school. He might come over here and pay for our lunch. Okay. Hi there, Captain, how are you? Oh, well, hello. Hi, you wanna join us? I'd love to, may I buy you lunch? Oh, that would be lovely, thank you. And maybe after lunch, we could have a drink. On my boat. - Oh, you have a boat! - Oh, you have a boat! - Sure. - Yeah, that would be great. Alright. Bubbly. Thank you. Thank you. - Top it off a little bit? - Sure. Why not? Thanks. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Should I put on some music? You know, why don't we just get naked? Alright, - yeah. - Yeah. Wow. Wow. Nice. Close your eyes. Mm. Keep your eyes closed, count from 10 to one and imagine your wildest dreams coming true. Mm. 10, nine... Seven... Sex... Uh, I mean six. Five, four... Hey, hey! My hat! Where are you going? Hey! My hat! Lena, Please, come home now. I know you don't wanna talk to me but just... Please, come home After the episode with the captain, Lena developed an inkling that their forlornness was coming to and end. She realized that nothing had changed and that she didn't want change after all. Meanwhile, Maria was absorbing nature and nature seemed to absorb her. Life had always felt like an abundance of opportunity, too overwhelming to make a choice. Now, nothing seemed to matter anymore. The wide space made Lena feel small and insignificant. She longed for the city where everything had a system and she knew her place. Maria, however, felt at ease with herself. She felt like a part of something bigger. And for the first time in a long while, she was happy and hopeful. Don't look. Don't look. No, I'm not looking. Don't look, no cheating. Don't look. Okay, here we go, here we go, - just one more step. - Alright, here? There you go, and tada! You made fire! - I made fire! - Wow! But that's not why we're here. - Why? - We are here to do a little burning ritual so you can free yourself. Okay, you ready? One, two, three. Yay! Okay, so free yourself, come on. Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, you have to free yourself, free yourself, come on! Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it! Do it, do it, burn it, burn it! Yay! Okay, there's more, okay. No, stop, stop! - One, two... - Stop! What? What the fuck is wrong with you? What's wrong with you? He never cheated on me. What? He never cheated on me, okay? I made it up. He never has, he never will be, it's just not who he is. Why would you do that? I don't know. You don't know. I know why. Because you're so fucking ungrateful. You just like to play around with people's feelings. You're so wise and you know everything, you have everything. I fucking quit my job because of you! Oh, don't put this on me, you hated your job! What a dreamer you are. Always dream big and then you get cold feet. What a rebel. You can never commit to anything. Always on your fucking phone, always withdrawn. You're so afraid. No, actually worse... You're a coward. I'm a coward? You're worse, you know why? Because you destroy everything, you just like to destroy everything because you're bored. You have everything, you have the perfect life, the perfect husband, the perfect marriage! You don't even know what you're talking about, okay? You're just jealous. You wanna know how I feel? You wanna know how I really feel? Fucking lost. Lost in this apartment, in my marriage, in this world where people are killing each other for religion, whatever. And all of my shit? I can't do anything with it. Can I be a mother? No. Can I make a difference? No. And it doesn't even matter because people will still kill each other and starve, and drown in oceans. And you know what? No one, no one expects anything of me anyway. So, it's all about you again. You are such an asshole. You really are a fucking spoiled bitch. - Fuck you. - Maria, Maria! Maria was upset and confused. She couldn't believe how naive she had been. At the same time, she felt a strange sense of relief. Lena had the feeling that this week actually had helped them after all. That they had found something together. A possibility of honesty, a chance to accept. She was wondering if Maria would agree and forgive her after all. Maybe, if she explained herself one more time.
