Don't pull off a stand or I will blow your head off. Be calm. Are you Kit? Who are you? Why were the cops in the cocktail party? How do I know? Damn you. Are you undercover? If I were, why didn't escape? I wouldn't have stayed here. If not you, who else? You idiot. What benefits will I get if the organization is ruined? You have contact with the police, right? If not, why didn't you get hurt in that raid? You can't frame me by all means. Why didn't you suspect Alan? If he is innocent, why isn't he around? Because he is undercover. So, the police is protecting him. He always love bullying others. I am not framing him. He doesn't trust the people from HK. He wants to control all. These are what I know. Trust me or not. Up to you. Brother Lung. I am Ah Fung, about your order. I have fixed. According my detailed investigation. Alan is the undercover. He allied with the cops! He wanted to take over our territory and our goods. Luckily, I stopped the goods. And get that bastard, otherwise, that would be shit. Don't worry. I will take care of here. If the goods are on board, I will call you again. Right... Kit, from now on, follow me to make big money I will show you the territory, got me? We take care of here and there. Go in. Uncle Fung. Brother Kit. Sit over there. Please sit. - How is it? - Nice. Brother Fung, the girls are not bad. Right here. Buddies, he is Uncle Fung from Hong Kong. Uncle Fung. Work hard. Forget the case of Alan, HK will go taking care of here. In this station, no one will harm us. Is the Thai food OK? Nice, but a little bit hot. I am afraid the hot weather and the hot food will make me sick. How about a bath? Then it's alright. You mean Thai bath? I haven't tried before. Really? Come here. How are you? Serve my boss with all your best. I am going in. After you. Come... Have you followed Uncle Fung for a long time? About 3 years? Uncle Fung is nice to you. Are you dealing every kind of business in HK? Various business. Not big at all. You mean this isn't big business? From HK to Thailand, wonderful! If I have a brother as yours in HK to take care of me, I don't have to worry. Alan is dead. Now, you are in-charge of Thailand, that's good. Most important of all, I wish I am taken care by HK's boss. Kidding. No kidding. It's useless to stay in Thailand. But HK is different. It's international. Not exactly, Hong Kong side does rely on Thailand side. That's right. How about the other business of your boss? Tell me. Why do you ask so much? Nothing. I just want to know more. Just do your work. Don't be nosy. It's funny. Wonderful. Great. The goods will be finished 2 days later. It's arranged to ship to Holland. Wonderful. Most important of all, take care of our goods. I will, if you know how to give me benefits. Back to Hong Kong, say something nice in front of the boss please. There are still many young girls. Just order, I will show you. Little brother, you are smart. Listen, learn more from Brother Kit. Yes. Get in What a mysterious place. This is the usual practice of a rascal. Kit, I know you won't let me down. Cut the crap. A man called Uncle Fung has come from HK. Here is his information. Check him. This lustful wolf is easy to handle. You'd be careful when dealing with this old fox. Don't panic. He comes for the first time, he can't do anything. We have to catch his head. It's useless to catch this wolf. What do you want? He is sent by his boss. If I can go to Hong Kong, I can check it out easily. How can we help you? Ask the cops to launch a raid, just pretend that it is done by his enemies. So as to push him back to Hong Kong. OK. We will have greater chance in Hong Kong. Then you will have a fast promotion. Beating crime is my duty. I don't care about any promotion. Kidding? Is it easily to be promoted in HK? No. He is bluffing only. Cut the crap. Ask your man to be smart. I won't be undercover twice. Go. Get in. Kidding? Who did it? I will investigate it. If I get it, I will kill them. Damn! How dare they ruin my territory? I have to get them by all means. After Alan's case, we are in deep ship again! Uncle Fung, don't get angry. I'll send more buddies to watch over. If they come again, Iwill kill them one by one. Uncle Fung, take it easy. I have ordered a great girl for you. Let's go. Uncle Fung. Ask everyone to stand by. We will rush in few minutes later. Don't you think Kit will be alright? It is OK. He is always careful. If this deal is smooth, I will report Brother Lung. You will be rewarded. Bravo! Set out. Hurry up... Go. Don't move. Shit. What a big trouble. I shouldn't have come to Thailand. Uncle Fung. You almost scared me to death. What's wrong with this? Cut the crap. Let's go. Watch over me. Go. Nothing there. - Go that way. - Yes. Damn it. Who are they? They are so cocky. Are they any undercovers? Otherwise, how can they know our workshop? I will kill that bastars if I check it out. It's useless to check. Our territory is ruined. Many of our buddies died. Even we know who did it, we can't compete with others. Why not hide up first? So, let's go back to HK first. Kit, you go with us too. Hong Kong Lighter? Stop bothering me. Brother, we can't get him. Will he show up? Don't worry. He will show up. Come on. We have amved. Keep the gun. Big brother, long time no see. - How are you? - I just want to chat with you. What? Aren't you welcome me? I have no time. Tak, move. Don't be that cocky. You have Chinese police to protect you. Come two days later. Be smart when you see the boss. Mind your tongue. Brother Lung, we are back. He is Kit. - Brother Lung. - You are Kit. What's wrong with you? It's all a mess. Brother Lung, it's my fault. After Alan that betrayer, the you ruined the territory. Brother Lung, I will find out who did it, and I will kill that bastard. Now you went into fugitive. We lost our territory and our goods. Do you know the loss? I have to be responsible too. Are you qualified? Brother Lung, he is so green. But, he works hard. He saved me in Thailand, right? Brother Lung, just take care of him. OK, let him do some minor job. Be the driver. Say "thank you". Thank you, Brother Lung. Brother Lung, it's almost time. Ask Judy to come down. I will wait for her in the car. Yes. Ching? It's not reasonable, they are alike! Why is she here? She is the woman of Boss. What are you looking? I will introduce a great girl for you tonight. Kit, Hong Kong & Thailand can't be compared. See, the girls are so pretty. You are bad. How can you compare me wit the Thai girls? She doesn't like it. Uncle Fung. Uncle Wah.

You can't earn all the money alone. I hope to co-operate with you. Co-operate with you? Isn't it necessary? Kidding. Do you want to take it alone? Brother Lung, it's better to co-operate, right? I don't think it's necessary. Don't you want the things go smooth? Do you have the power to bother my business? Don't say so. We just have a discussion only. Brother, think about my suggestion. I am not interested. I have no time to talk to you. Fung, let's go. He is so cocky. What do you think? I'll teach him a lesson. Go. Brother Lung, I think you have to think it seriously.
