He called the poor fellow to his bungalow and.. Whipped him. He has taken birth to shower atrocities. Unless we don't raise a voice against him, this is bound to happen. No one can harm him. It's only now that you've got to know Dwarka. I know him from the time.. I was a commander of this tribe. He used to shower atrocities even at that time. Even today my back shivers with the memory of his whip. I'll distribute sweets when Dwarka dies. Shut up! Aren't you ashamed.. Of saying such things about someone? I don't know why Jhansi is always in favor of Dwarka. Jhansi, I swear by your life. After becoming a commander, if I don't straighten Dwarka.. Then, my name is not Banno Singh. My name is not Banno. Crap. Is Banno a name? You talk beyond your capacity. He'll become a commander. No. Your Jhumroo will become a commander. Yes, Jhumroo will be the commander.

Thank you, Mr. Jhumroo. "My heart dances." "My heart dances." "Slim waist, flirtatious eyes. You're awesome." "My heart dances." "Slim waist, flirtatious eyes. You're awesome." "My heart dances." "Swing and dance in glee." "The world tells me to stop a bit." "Swing and dance in glee." "The world tells me to stop a bit." "I won't listen." - "This is mere talk. - Go." - "I can see. - What?" "Green world." "Swing and dance in glee." "Wow! Madame." "Wow! Madame." "My lover sings and dances in joy." "My heart dances." "Slim waist, flirtatious eyes. You're awesome." "My heart dances." "I don't know what you fear." "I feel like laughing." "I don't know what you fear." "I feel like laughing." "My love, my affection." "Is in trouble." "I say, my love." "You're laughing." "Run, catch him, my love will fall down." "My heart dances." "Slim waist. Father had said, son." "My heart dances." "I don't understand anything. I am still young, my love." "Tell me what love is. Swear by me." "I don't understand anything. I am still young, my love." "Tell me what love is. Swear by me." "We'll roam everywhere like crazy." "I'll not listen to anyone. You don't listen to anyone." "You and I will keep talking, my love." "My heart dances." "Slim waist, flirtatious eyes. You're awesome." Ramesh. You're back? Where's Anjana? She must be on her way, sir. Sir. It was so much fun today, sir. What happened? Sir. Without playing the flute.. I became the dancing Krishna. I entered a flock of girls in no time. I spoke to them about love. While I was doing this, miss Anjana left. Where did she go? That Jhumroo? She went with him. Father was right. Son, don't love anyone because someome has told you. Keep quiet. Quiet. You don't have brains. How did she go? Why did she go? What are you doing? Father had said. Count till 10 if an elder person is angry. I was counting. Idiot! Donkey! I don't know which tribal my daughter has gone with. You're standing here staring at my face. Aren't you ashamed? Idiot. Mr. Ramesh. I didn't expect this from you. Sir. Miss. Anjana is back. I can see that. I have eyes. You're so strange. You left me in the forest all alone. And you came in the car. How did you come? - I came walking, father. - Hey! Father had said. Walking makes you healthy. Keep quiet, father's son. Anjana. You should be careful.. - That the settlement people. - Jhumroo? Father, if it wasn't for Jhumroo.. I would've lost my way. It's okay. - But you. - Father, I do remember? One. No interfering in your work. Two. No meeting settlement people. Three. Don't go out alone. Got it. I remember the first rule. I remember the 2nd rule. Third? Don't go out alone. Ramesh. Listen. If Anjana goes to the settlement down there.. You'll have it from me. Yes, yes, sir. Strange. I am in trouble if I listen to the father. I land in a difficulty if I listen to the daughter. Father. Father. You had said, son. One should never interfere in a daughter's affairs. Sorry. You're in heaven, father. Wrong number. Listen. Everyone pay attention. I've called all of you.. For some urgent work. I am growing old. So, I thought.. We should choose a commander while I am still alive. So that I can train him.. Teach him.. And make him capable of handling this seat. Commander is right. We have to choose a person.. Who's intelligent. Brave. And loved by everyone. Yes, baba's right. Baba's right. I would suggest.. Hariya to be made the commander. Yes! Right. In the entire tribe.. If anyone deserves to be the commander.. It's my Jhumroo. Jhumroo and commander? Aunt. It's not easy to be a commander. Chasing city girls is a different thing.. Than being a commander. Banno! Hey! I'll pull out your tongue if you say bad things about Jhumroo. - Chamki! - Go away. Talking loudly and showing anger is different than becoming a commander. No body is more brave and courageous than Jhumroo in the entire tribe. Still I'll be the commander. Everyone knows me very well. Still they're building castles in the wind. Aunt? Where's your Jhumroo? Today he didn't even come here because of me. He'll come if he hasn't come yet. I have made Jhumroo capable.. Of being your commander. And shoulder the responsibility of the entire tribe. That is my joy.. And my life. Fine. Everyone has the right to contest elections. The decision will be transparent. As per our tribe's rule. Whoever wins the elections will be the chosen. You're trying to defame my Jhumroo. My Jhumroo will never go against me. Jhumroo will be the commander. He'll marry a girl from this tribe. Jealous people like you will fall flat on your face. Understand? Aunt, you're dreaming. Didn't you hear? Jhumroo will marry a girl from this tribe. But after becoming the commander.. I am going to hold your hand. You'll hold my hand? Wash your face in a fistful of water. You! I am not going to leave this hand all my life. Really? Swear by me. You won't leave my hand in your entire life. You? Go away. Today you left my hand. You'll fall at my feet tomorrow. Your city girl is not going to come here today. How do you know? I won't tell you. There's a feast at her place. There's a celebration. Fine, don't tell. Stop. You'll be cheated if you go there. Mr. Irani, how was your hunt? How can I go hunting? Mr. Dwarka, you are a hunter. Mr. Shapoor sometimes you end up speaking the truth while casual chatting. Huh? Excuse me. Come, Anjana. He's our retired deputy collector, Mr. Mathur. His wife. - Greetings. - Greetings. Come. Let me introduce you to STO. He our STO. Mr. Daleep Singh. His wife. - Greetings. - Greetings. Thank you. He is Mr. Shapoor. - His wife, Shirin. And Daughter. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Greetings. Come home some day, miss Anjana. Sure. Please come, sir. Never mind, forgot. Sir. Coming. - How do you like this place? - It's lovely. I'll just come. Welcome. Miss. Miss! Yes. You shouldn't have come here. I had to come here because you didn't come even after making me a promise. I couldn't come because of this party. Let's go out. Why did you have to come here? Why wouldn't I come? I was urgent. What's so urgent? You forgot so soon? Our festival. - Commander's election. - I remember all of that. I'll come. - Look, just leave from here. - I won't go. Greetings, Madame. Sir. Greetings. What are you doing over here? I got the news of walking.. And the celebration came. I came because I got the news about the celebration. Useless. It's grand. Such a celebration in this region.. Has never happened in the past. I'm just.. I am just... I came uninvited. No issues. But, sir. How are you feeling now? What? How are you feeling? Better. You had to be. Do you remember? In 12 months.. The oil prepared by mixing 13 herbs. I know. But, sir. You didn't come to climb or descend the mountain again. The road is tired of waiting for you. What nonsense? The mountain is tired of waiting for you. You would've come, climbed and then fallen down again. I would've given you a massage. I am not very fond of mountain climbing. I went just like that the other day. Come, Anju. Baby, one more thing. Sir. I've taught your daughter to climb and descend a mountain. But I didn't get baby yet. What? I didn't get my reward. You'll get it. Bhairo, get sweets. I'll eat. Sweetmeat. Baby, eat. I am sorry. Come here. Dear friends. I've given you the trouble to come here. There's a reason behind it. I want to share a good news with you all. As you're aware. First let me introduce her. She's my daughter, Anjana. After completing her M.A.. She has come here for the first time. He is my secretary, Mr. Ramesh. He's a very interesting person. On this happy occasion, in your presence.. I announce their engagement. Father! Congratulations, miss. Anjana. - Father had said. - Congratulations, Anjana. Congratulations, Anjana. Congratulations, miss. Anjana. Be it late.. But you did a favor by clearing my misunderstanding. What are you saying? Jhumroo, don't misunderstand me. Jhumroo? So you are Jhumroo. You kept in the dark all this while. Father! Kalu. Father! Father. Take him away. Whip him. - Kalu! - Anju! Dwarka, what happened? What's the matter? Who was he? Nothing important. He's from the settlement. They come asking for alms. Don't bother. Come, let's have food. Let's go. Please sit. Let's go. How she shines, really. That's it. Ah! Come. The person you're looking for is right here. Where is he? At your feet. See. My injured heart. Take care of it. Jhumroo? Where were you all this time? Hey? Hey? How did you get hurt? When an insect crawling on the ground tries to touch the moon in the sky, this is bound to happen. - What say, Hariya? - Yes, brother. Whoever walks with his head held high will falter. He'll falter in such a way, he'll come back to his senses. Have you never faltered? You've broken your hands and legs so many times. Even my heart is broken. Whose hands and legs are going to break.. Will come out in the elections tomorrow. What will you know tomorrow? Tomorrow Jhumroo will become the commander. That coward will become a commander when I am still here? Look there. He's running away. Look Bannu. I don't want to be the commander. How will you become a commander? Go, my child. Go, sleep in your mother's lap. Shut up! Dare you take my mother's name. What will happen? Huh? You! Jhumroo. Thrash him up. Jhumroo, make a sauce out of him. Tear it. Tear it. Leave it! Leave! ♪ Stop it! What's going on? Banno. If you're so powerful, show it in the tomorrow's elections. Here's your knife. Get out of here. Aunt. Don't forget to send your dear son to the election tomorrow. Go. Mother, I don't want to become the commander. Jhumroo? Don't ever say it again. You have to become the commander. Not for yourself, my son. For me. For my honor. Can't you do just this for your mother? Say, yes. Say yes, my son. Jhumroo? If this makes you happy.. I'll try to become the commander. Don't try. You'll definitely become one, my son. You surely will. Brothers. The king gets fame. Public works hard. The commander of this tribe has ordered.. All of you to gather at the settlement's crossroads. The elections for selecting the commander is about to begin. Yes! Wow! Jhumroo! Hey! Jhumroo! Very good, Jhumroo! Hey! Wow! Listen! The last fight between Jhumroo and Banno is about to begin. Is there a brave heart.. Who will stand in front of Jhumroo's aim? Jhumroo! Hey! Very good, Chamki. Very good. Long live, commander Jhumroo. I don't agree. Is it? This is a game of gypsies. Come in front if you're a man. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me who your commander is. Jhumroo's the commander. Long live. Long live commander Jhumroo! Long live commander Jhumroo! Long live commander Jhumroo! Long live commander Jhumroo! Long live commander Jhumroo! Long live commander Jhumroo! Brothers. With his bravery and courage Jhumroo has proved.. That Jhumroo deserves to be the commander. I announce.. That after me.. Jhumroo will be the commander of this tribe. Long live commander Jhumroo! Long live commander Jhumroo! Mother! Jhumroo! My son. Jhumroo. Jhumroo. You saved my honor today. You've fulfilled all my dreams today. Now in this tribe.. I can hold my head high with pride. Long live commander Jhumroo! Long live commander Jhumroo! As per our tribe's tradition.. The song and dance ceremony of choosing one's husband will begin. At the end of the song.. Whichever girl garlands Jhumroo first.. Will marry him. Wow! She's so happy. You'll become mere spectators. I will get married. To Jhumroo. - "Come here. - No." "Go." - "World of love. - Where are you coming?" - "World of love. - Where are you coming?" - "To persuade my bride. - Go away, you madman." - "To persuade my bride. - Go away, you madman." "I won't leave your doorstep, girl." "I'll die if I can't live, girl." "I want to achieve something before leaving, girl." - "Come here. - No." - "Go. - Never." - "Come here. - No." - "Go. - Never." "Come here." - "Stop your heart. - Heart doesn't listen." - "Stop your heart. - Heart doesn't listen." - "It's a lie, my dear. - Swear by love." - "It's a lie, my dear. - Swear by love." "People have always lost their senses in love." "They lift an amber mistaking it for a flower." "He who plays with fire will burn." - "Come here. - No." - "Go. - Never." - "Come here. - No." - "Go. - Never." "Come here." This is the biggest failure of my life.. I had to come with you, Chamki. At last, you won. Your wish is fulfilled. But remember. You will never get my love. Even if I become the commander of the tribe's honor is at stake. The person I loved once.. I will never forget her. Who? I don't have any right to say her name. You have the right. Anju? You? Yes, Jhumroo. Because of that day's misunderstanding.. Don't misunderstand me. I had to bend in front of my father's adamancy. Do you remember? I had promised you. When you'll become the tribe's commander.. I'll definitely come. I've come. But? Your marriage was announced that day. That was wrong. Anyone can be forced. The tribe stopped you.. And father stopped me. But the storm of love.. Cannot be stopped by anyone. Anju. You still don't believe? "My love, my innocent heart is lost somewhere." "My love, my innocent heart is lost somewhere." "My love, my steps are not on track. Something is wrong with me." "My love, my innocent heart is lost somewhere." "The weather is pleasant. My eyes are silent." "I forgot everything." "You say something." - "The weather is pleasant. - Pleasant." - "My eyes are silent. - Silent." "I forgot everything." "You say something." "You left." "Came back." "You're shy." "It's like a fable." "My love, my innocent heart is lost somewhere." "My love, my steps are not on track. Something is wrong with me." "My love, my innocent heart is lost somewhere." "Why are you anxious? Why has your kohl become dull?" "Why do clouds fly on the moon's face?" - "Why are you anxious? - Anxious." - "Why has your kohl become dull? - Dull." "On moon's face." "Why do clouds fly?" "Magician.." "Your eyes." "After getting lost in love.." "My heart is going crazy." "My love, my innocent heart is lost somewhere." "My love, my steps are not on track. Something is wrong with me." "My love, my innocent heart is lost somewhere." "In love.." "After I found my love." "I am not in my senses." "What's wrong with you?" - "In love.. - Yes." - "..After I found my love. - What happened?" - "I am not in my senses. - Alright." "What's wrong with you?" "When I met you.." "I was pleased." "My heart was pleased." "I've become crazy." "My love, my innocent heart is lost somewhere." "My love, my steps are not on track. Something is wrong with me." "My love, my innocent heart is lost somewhere." Where's Anjana? Here she is. But we won't let her go. She tried to destroy us. She made fun of our tradition. She'll be punished for it. Stop your nonsense. Sir, why are you staring at us? We're not at fault. Your daughter is. Whatever she's done.. She should be punished for it. Shut up. Stay in your limits. I can crush you if I want. I can ruin you. Sir, a person is responsible for his honor. You too are a human being. Not God. Amar! Kalu. Father! Get into the car. You can't take Anjana. As per the tribe's tradition, Ajana will get married to me. If you take even a step towards me.. I'll shoot you. Drop the gun. Hand over Anjana to me. If that's the case.. Then shoot me first. Jhumroo! Sir, take your daughter. Lock her in your house. No. Leave me! Jhumroo! Wake up! Saw your son's act? Keep quiet. Anjana. Anjana. Mother, you don't understand. I just won't let Dwarkanath continue with his atrocities. Keep quiet. Answer me. Is Anjana his daughter? Yes, she's his daughter. You love her? More than my life. What about her? She too. Once. Take me to her, son. Really, mother? Come with me. Stupid. Do one thing. Bring her here. - Alright. - Listen. No one should come to know of this. Jhumroo. Jhumroo. Why have you come here? Father is still angry about yesterday's incident. I shouldn't meet you. I shouldn't come to you. He has imprisoned me here. You go away. They'll kill you. - Jhumroo. - No, Anju. I don't care about anyone. I've come to fetch you. I'll take you with me. Thief! Thief! Come with me. Looks like your father's car. - Now what? - Don't be afraid. Come with me. I fear.. Dad won't get us together. They will kill you. No body can separate me from you. - Not even your father? - How's that possible? I'll elope with you. Your father will become a mere spectator. Really Jhumroo? You love me so much? Yes, Anju. More than my life. Really? Jhumroo. Jhumroo. Jhumroo. Come to me. Jhumroo. - What is it? - Tell us where our Madame baby is. Who Madame baby? Who Madame baby? Whom were you talking to? I was talking to myself. Talking to myself? You're telling lies? Look around if I am lying. I'll see. I'll definitely see. Nandu. Go there. I'll check here. He's trying to act smart with us. - Anjana! - Not Anjana, Chamki. That witch meets you here secretly? I'll correct her right away. Batwoman. Don't you sleep at night? Go home. Go home? I'll go to sir right away and expose you in front of the village court. Chamki! - Chamki! - Sir. "Forget it. Go." "Forget it. Go." "Go." "Go." "Forget it." "I am not less either." "I'll slap you." "I am not less either." "I'll slap you." "You're dancing." "I'll make you forget all your sorrows." "You're dancing." "I'll make you forget all your sorrows." "Sa..re..ga..ma..ma..re..ga." "Ma..ma..ma..ma..re..ga." "Ma..ma..ma..ma..re..ga." "Pa..pa..ni..pani." "Pa..pa..ni..pani." "Pa..pa..ni..ni." "Forget it." "I'll expose you." "You're going to die." "I'll break your skull." "You're going to die." "Die." "Let me eat." Who's there? Who's there? Where had you been? You know it. Why did you go? You don't have any choice in this house. No matter what, I won't let your foolishness.." "Harm my honor." Because of your adamancy.. I won't let my dignity be humiliated. Love may not have any importance in your eyes. But this false honor.. I can refuse respect, wealth and everything in this world for love. Shut up! Your decision will not work in this house.. Only mine will. Don't touch. You slapped me today. Just because you're a father? Had.. My mother been here. Anjana, my child. Uncle Bihari? You? You're here? So many years have passed since I visited this place. I wouldn't have come today. But I had to come for you. Since the day you came here.. Not even once did Dwarka treat you.. Like a father treats his child. Today. - Father. - Slapped you. That cruel man can do anything in the pride of fake honor. Your mother became a victim of his cruelty.. And she'll shedding tears even today. Mother? My mother's alive? Uncle Bihari? Where's my mother? I beg of you. I fall at your feet. Where's my mother? Tell me quickly. Where's my mother? I came here to tell you that. This storm will not calm down if I don't tell you. Your mother.. Was a poor labourer. But she was very innocent and beautiful. Dwarka saw her.. They fell in love with each other. They went ahead. You were born. But in spite of repeated requests.. The proud man refused to get married. Poor girl was heartbroken. But your smile wiped her tears. She went to the settlement with you. Dwarka was not sorry that your mother left him. But even a monster loves his child. In a fit of rage, he landed at the settlement on one night. He forcefully separated you from your mother. Then he sent you to town. Do I have the same blood? Yes, my child. The tribe took.. Their revenge on me. They abducted my son. My wife died of this shock. Dwarka fraudulently transferred all my property to his name. Dwarka didn't just give me.. Hatred and deceit.. But also two square meals.. And alcohol to forget my grief. I still get it. But? Where's my mother? I can't survive without her. Tell me. You don't know or? Poor gypsy woman, Kamli. One day. What? No. If you want to know about your mother's whereabouts.. Go to the tribe's settlement. Ask Kamli. She'll tell you about your mother's whereabouts. What did you tell Anjana about her mother? Dwarka, do you remember? A genuine alcoholic never lies. He can't tolerate cruelty towards anyone. You ruined her mother's life. Now you want to destroy your daughter's dreams for your adamancy? I don't argue. I just want to know what you told Anjana. Something she should've known. Not because.. I want to avenge my destruction from you. I value humanity more than wealth. I can crush your humanity and throw it away. Who all are you going to sacrifice in the name of false pride and selfishness? In spite of being a friend you fraudulently ruined me. You didn't give the love of your life, a wife's status. Today you're hell bent on ruining your own child? Mind your tongue. Don't forget that you're surviving on food throw by me. You took away this food from me. Bihari. Dwarka. Bihari, remember. If Anjana comes to know her mother's name or address.. I'll kill you. You've used this all your life. I don't care about my life. What more can happen? The arrow has already left the bow. What do you mean? You can't stop the mother and daughter from uniting. See. There goes your daughter. Unfortunate Kamli from the settlement will tell her who her mother is. This cannot happen as long as I am alive. Anybody there? Kamli owns this hotel, right? Are you Kamli? I came to know that you know a lot about Anjana's mother. Is it true? Answer me. I've come to warn you. Anjana should not know the truth. Understand? I find coming to such a place disrespectful. I had to come for my daughter's good. It's your good fortune.. That I stepped into your hut. Sir, you're right. Stop this pretence of touching my feet. I know that to keep your mouths shut.. I'll have to pay a price. Here. You still have habit of buying everything.. With money? Kamli? Kamla? - You? - Your daughter's unfortunate mother. You recognised her. I didn't know.. That you're here. Because.. I am helpless. I am weak. I am a victim of your cruelty. You cheated me for your ulterior motives. You ruined me for your false pride. You took away my daughter from me. The stone heart of this father.. Has hit a mother's affectionate delicate heart in such a way.. The wound.. Will never heal. Never. Never. Kamla, look. There's no use talking about it. Not you. It's the question of my daughter's life. I understand my responsibility. I am her mother. I am her father. I gave her the love of both mother and father. I brought her up. I educated her. Respect, honor, status, wealth, property. After spending all her life in educated culture.. When all if a sudden Anjana comes to know.. That you are her mother.. She is related to you by blood. A settlement of illiterate, rural and tribal people.. Is her house. What will she go through? This is the difference between the land and sky. How will she take it? Her life, her dreams and her desires.. Will be ruined. Your honor.. And false pride will also be ruined. You value it more than a mother's affection.. And a daughter's love. To hug my daughter.. My arms are dying since last 20 years. Today.. You'll have to pay the.. Price of it. Tell me. What price do you quote? Sorrow for sorrow. Tears for tears. Whatever I suffered all my life.. You too will have to suffer the same. Remember. A chance to avenge cruelty.. Every person gets it once in his life. I don't want to argue. You know that I own this region. If I wish, I can destroy this settlement. But I had to come to you for Anjana's betterment. If you claim to be her mother.. And you really have a mother's affection towards her. Anjana should not know this secret, Kamla. Sir, something strange happened. What happened? Sir, I went to Bihari's room with food for him, everything in the room was in a mess. Then? Bihari's not there, sir. This letter was lying on the table. Very good. Take this letter and keep it back from where found it. Nobody should get to know of this. Right, sir. You're my mother? Mother! Open the door. Open the door. Tell me who my mother is. Tell me, mother. Tell me. Are you my mother? I don't know. Go away. Your mother's not here. How can a gypsy woman be your mother? Your family on the one side.. And we on the other. Go away. Go away. I came to you with a lot of hopes. Don't disappoint me, mother. Get down fast. Let me go. Move aside. What have I done? Why am I being humiliated? I am being humiliated. Because of you. May be that's why you've built a wall of.. Your false pride between your wife and daughter. Anju, you're making false allegations against me. Believe me. I am not your enemy. Your mother.. Is no more. How can you meet her? I didn't find her today but some day I definitely will. Uncle Bihari never lies to me. If you trust Bihari more than me.. Then it'll be proved right away.. That whatever he told you.. Was in a state of drunkenness. Come with me. Uncle Bihari? Uncle Bihari? I am fed up of this atmosphere. I am tired of life. I am going. No one should bother about where I am going. I may live or die.. No one should bother about me. I am responsible for my life and death. Uncle Bihari? He committed suicide. - Sorry? - He called you home, didn't you? He feared the truth, hence committed suicide. Impossible. Why did he have to commit suicide? Why did he do this? What for? Because he lied to you. Now you know the truth. Mother? Anju came here last night? Yes. I heard that Dwarkanath came here with his men and took her away forcefully. - Yes. - You didn't try to stop him? Son, what right do I have on a stranger's daughter? Mother, what are you saying? It's you who said that you want to meet her. - Now that she came here. - That was a mistake. I realised my mistake. Mother? What's wrong with you? I am sure you're hiding something from me. We've got nothing to do with them. They are rich. We're poor. Rich and poor can never come together. Wealth, property, respect and status. What is it they don't have? We're illiterate, rural, tribal. This difference between the land and sky.. Anjana will never be able to tolerate it. Her life.. Her desires.. Will be ruined. But I won't let my life.. And my desires be ruined. Jhumroo! Jhumroo, where are you going? Jhumroo. - You can't go inside. - Stop. - You? - Yes. Why have you come here? You know what I am here for. Why this anger? You want to meet Anjana, don't you? Yes. Before you meet Anjana.. I need to talk to you. Me? Yes. Jhumroo, I am thinking of getting Anjana married. Marriage? To whom? She loves you. I love her too. So you love each other. We can give our lives for each other. I have no objections for this marriage. We should also ask Anjana about this. You wait here. I'll send her. Anjana. Jhumroo is here. Father! I want the marriage decision.. To happen today. Decision of marriage? Yes. You'll have to reject this proposal. Reject? I cannot do this. Never. - Even if that costs me my life. - Right now, Jhumroo's life is at stake. You know that I do what I intend to do. Anjana, remember one thing. Jhumroo's life depends on your decision. No. This can't happen. This can't happen. Jhumroo. Anjana! Anju. Jhumroo, I can't live without you. Take me out of here. Anju, there's no need to go away like this. I'll take you home after a grand wedding in full grandeur. - After the marriage. - Jhumroo, you. You don't know. What should I know? Everything is fine. Your father has agreed. He promised me that he'll get us married. But. But. But, what? Anju, what happened? Why did you become silent? Nothing. The world doesn't work on wishes. There's a big difference between you and me. I am rich. You're poor. What are you talking all of a sudden? How has love got to do with wealth and poverty? By forgetting the reality.. I will not become blind in fake love. Do you still doubt my love? Have you changed your mind? Answer me, Anju. Don't you love me? Don't you want to get married to me? The question of marriage doesn't arise between unequals. So like rich people, you also pretended to be in love with me. You made fun of my love. You cheated me. Those promises were false. Those meetings, those promises. Why did you do this? Why did you call me here? To give you the good news. I am getting married. I didn't know that there's fraud and deceit .. Hiding behind your beauty and innocence. Now you leave. Do come for the wedding. Don't bother about the gift. Congratulations. I was wrong, I believed you. I shouldn't known it earlier. Poor and rich are different not only by wealth and stature.. But also hearts. Jhumroo, I wish you knew. I wish I could tell you. "I don't have a companion." "I don't have any support." "I don't belong to anyone." "No one belongs to me." "I don't have a companion." "I don't have any support." "It's a lonely evening." "How will I find my destination?" "It's a lonely evening." "How will I find my destination?" "He who used to show me my way." "That star isn't there." "I don't have a companion." "I don't have any support." "Scenery, don't laugh." "We won't meet again." "I don't have any support." "Where do I go?" "I am walking aimlessly." "He who would call me again." "That signal is not there." "I don't have a companion." "I don't have any support." "I don't belong to anyone." "No one belongs to me." Miss. Anjana. Anjana. How beautiful? You look so pretty. Anjana. I know what you're going through. Don't worry. Father had said. Never become a barrier between true love. If possible.. Bring down that barrier and unite two lovers. But because of father's fear.. I built this barrier. This misunderstanding will never go away from Jhumroo's mind. I'll clear this misunderstanding. No use. I insulted him. I rejected his love. He will never believe this truth. I deserve his hatred. Jhumroo. Jhumroo. Manager? What's left to be destroyed? What do you want to burn? Chamki? I don't understand what you're saying. Can you tell me where Jhumroo is? I have to meet him. It's urgent. She didn't spare anything. Why has that city girl sent you? Chamki. Jhumroo is not sitting here to suffer your atrocities. He went to climb the mountain. Aunt was crying. She kept telling him. Whoever goes there never comes back. Your city girl is the cause of this. I am telling you. If anything happens to my Jhumroo.. I am not going to keep quiet. My name is not Chamki. Chamki, why are you talking like a lunatic? Try to understand. Neither Jhumroo nor Anjana are at fault. We are at fault. We're coming in between both of them. I love Anjana. You love Jhumroo. And they love each other. Chamki, it's our duty.. To unite them and leave their path. You leave. I will not give up. I am a woman. If a woman can ruin someone's life.. She can also make it. Father had said. Son. A real lover.. Doesn't take revenge, but gives sacrifice. Chamki. We don't have much time. Jhumroo's life is in danger. If anything happens to him.. You will be responsible. No. That can't happen. I can give my life for Jhumroo. Chamki. I expected this from you. Come with me. Jhumroo! Jhumroo! Jhumroo! Jhumroo! Jhumroo! Jhumroo! Jhumroo. Jhumroo, you have to come back. I won't go. Why have you come here? To clear your misunderstanding. Anjana really loves you. The manger told me everything. She did everything to save your life. It's a lie. Jhumroo, I am telling the truth. You'll come to know everything. Come for now. If not for me, come for Anjana's sake. Jhumroo! Jhumroo! Let's go. Let's go. No person from the settlement should come up. As you wish, sir. Huh? So? Aren't you ashamed? Go. Son of a bear. Don't you have a mother and sister in your house? You're ogling at my daughters. No, mother. Sir has ordered not to let strangers inside. Son, I am not a stranger. We've come from Kathmandu, on the occasion of the daughter's wedding.. To sing, dance and give our blessings. Alright, mother. Didn't recognise me? The big boss from Kathmandu. What's his name? I forgot. Rana sir? Yes, Rana sir. He sent me to sing and dance in your daughter's wedding. You'll dance? Son. It's not my time. When I used to dance in my youth.. - The audience used to become spell bound. - Alright. Listen. Make arrangements for their dance. But, son. Let me first bless your daughter. - Where's your daughter? - She. Get aside. Where's my daughter? Here she is. Today my daughter will go to her husband's house. May God.. Make you live.. 100 years. May your husband live till 50. What nonsense, old man? So you are that useless fellow? You'll marry my daughter? Naughty boy. Give me a hug. You? Glory to the mother. Father had said. Son. If you want to take an old woman's blessings.. - Fall at her feet. - Go ahead. God bless, my son. God bless, my daughter. God bless, my son. Child, I'll go check on my kids. I'll see if they are ready or not. Mother. "Gauri, listen to me." "Someone has sneeked into your locality." "Timbak tu." "Kathmandu." "I am a magnet." "How can I be safe?" "Timbak tu." "Kathmandu." "I am a magnet." "How can I be safe?" "Just." "How can walls stop a bumblebee?" "Thorns can use their swords." "How can walls stop a bumblebee?" "How can walls stop a bumblebee?" "I am a magnet." "How can I be safe?" "Just." "The fire fly is here to meet you." "Fire fly." "My flame, you haven't recognised me." "Haven't recognised." "The fire fly is here to meet you." "My flame, you haven't recognised me." "I am the crazy fellow. Don't blink." "Take the veil off your eyes." "Just." "Timbak tu." "Kathmandu." "I am a magnet." "Magnet." "How can I be safe?" "Just." "You have to come with me." "Come with me." "The moon needs to meet the clouds." "Meet." "You have to come with me." "The moon needs to meet the clouds." "If anyone tries to stop you, leave your hair." "Sneek out." "Switch off the lights, go." "Timbak tu." "Kathmandu." "I am a magnet." "How can I be safe?" "Timbak tu." "Kathmandu." "I am a magnet." "How can I be safe?" "Just." I am saved. Uh! I am afraid, they'll definitely come here. This marriage. They won't let it happen so easily, brother. They can't harm us. The entire tribe is ready to fight them. Priest, you perform the wedding. I'll stay on guard. You guard the bridge with the men. I'll manage here. You manage there. Right. Let's go. - Hurry up. - Both of you take oath of God.. That you'll be with each other all your lives. Child, garland him. Here you go, my child. Chant. - No, my child. - Mother, let me go. - Jhumroo. This marriage will take place. Garland him. Who dared to enter the lion's den? - Hurry up. - Chant. Who dares to challenge me? Me. A woman. A mother. Unaccepted, and nervous. I am standing in front of you to save my husband. You know, at time.. Mother can become powerful to save his son. I'll also free you. If Anjana doesn't come here before I finish counting 5.. I'll burn this settlement and turn it to ashes. These are not wedding rituals.. But your funeral rituals. Commander, no use fighting. I'll understand everything. Hey! It's not good to be adamant. You had done something similar in the past in your pride of wealth. You promised marriage to Kamli and cheated her. You abducted her innocent child. I was the commander of this tribe at that time. I abducted a kid from your house to take a revenge. I put it in her lonely lap. The child's smile wiped her tears. It was not Anjana. He was Jhumroo. Your he is Bihari's son. Which you have ruined. Stop! Father! - What happened? - He shot the commander. Commander. Stop. The rituals are not over yet. We can perform the rituals later. Dwarka, how many bullets do you have? You? You're still alive? Yes. This old commander must've saved me to see this day. How would I have got back my lost wealth? How would I come to know that Jhumroo is my son? Last wish of my life. My biggest wish. I found my son. Father. My son. My son. My son. Dwarka. Today, for his happiness.. Let alone your gun, I can even face a mortar launcher. Kalu. Why are you wasting your bullets? Why do you want to take innocent lives? You have a problem with me. If your gun is thirsty for blood.. Shoot me. Son. Let's see.. Whether you run out of bullets.. Or my courage. Shoot. Shoot. Make me a widow. So that the world will say.. A proud father widowed his daughter for his false pride. You've been misled by these people. - Get aside, my child. - Child? Child, who? Whose child? The father - daughter relation ended the day.. I came to know that you cheated my mother. Enough! Fire! Kill each of them. Put this settlement on fire. Shoot. No! No! No! Move! Move! Dare anyone raise his hand against him. Master. Master. Dare. Dare you try to raise your hand against my master while I am alive. Go away. Go away. I always.. Gave you sufferings.. Sorrow.. And tears. Now. Now. But, today. I'll adorn your forehead. Father! Get aside. - Father! - Take him. Come. You people look very happy? You're under my control today. Do you know who I am? The bride's father. - If I want, I can. - No, brother Bihari. I thank God.. That we've come together because of the kids. - Aren't you happy? - Why not? Shake hands. But where are the kids? The kids? Tey must be here, "I am Jhumroo. I roam around like ankle bells. I sing the song of love." "I have eyes on the destination. "I don't care about the world. I bury the past under dust." Father had said. Son. All's well.. - That ends well. - "I have eyes on the destination." - All is well at in hell. - " I don't care about the world." Uncle. Where are you going all alone? Take me along.
