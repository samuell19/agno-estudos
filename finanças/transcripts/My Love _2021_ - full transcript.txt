What do I think of when I'm in a competition? Victory? Honor? Or glory? None of that. All I think of is the swimming pool before me. I'll jump in with all my might, embrace the water, and feel the strength it brings to me. Once you're out of the pool, it doesn't matter whether you're the champion of the race, because you have successfully surpassed yourself. And above all else... you've earned the admiration of the girl you love. Coach, you're boasting! Silence! Stay still! Coach Zhou! Please! Let us down! We apologize! Now you know my story, have you learned any moral from it? I tell you, give it all you got,win the swimming competition, so you'll seize your NCEE exam bonus! Do you hear me? Yes, coach! Then get the heck down and back to your training! Move it! Swim cap! "You Yongci" it strangely reminded me of "swimming pool" when I first heard her name. I didn't realize I'd find her name written all over my youth. In 2006, I was seventeen. My high school life used to differ from other high-schoolers, for I was the star player of my school swimming team! You trying to play hooky again? If you two keep messing around, you'll be expelled! Sorry about that, I was boasting a little. I wasn't a star player of any sort. Me and Zhang Fang here... Yep, the one in red swimsuit. We were the slackers that got all the scolds. But it was fine with me, my marks at school were already beyond redemption anyway. Naturally, for someone 17-year-old like me, there was nothing more blood-boiling than... a brawl! Stay where you are! That was the first time I met her. It was also my first time witnessing such beauty. Despite the hard beating I got... I kind of managed to get her attention. I had the worst bruises of all time after that brawl. But inside, I felt so much joy. I thought, maybe it was the feel of a budding romance. Well well well, Zhou Xiaoqi, you are a real piece of work! How many fights have you picked since you transferred to our school? I tell you, I must talk to your mother face to face! Now where's her number? Are you the new transfer student? Come in. And you! Stand straight! Think what you've done! Now hand me your profiles. You Yongci... Why transferring on graduation year? Good marks on every subject... Keep it up. Don't burden yourself over graduation. If you run into any problem, come to me for help. Miss Chen! The dean wants to see you. Wait for me here. Hey, swimming pool I'm Zhou Xiaoqi, and I just transferred here last year. Your name resembles a "swimming pool", and I just happen to be on the swimming team! What a nice coincidence! You know, I can help you with anything on transferring! My doors are open for you at all times! I do see an "open door" right there. I don't suppose anyone would like to leave such a first impression to his dream girl. From then on, You Yongci had been the apple of all the boys' eyes. Their ways of drawing her attention all seemed very childish to me. But of course, I was one of them too. Faster! What the? Jerk. They were just being jerks, never mind them. You Yongci! Hello to you! The name's Sha Yu. I'm captain of the swimming team. This is the trophy I won last year from the Junior High School Swimming League. It's my gift to you! And you'll get a new one every year! Don't humiliate yourself, "Shark". I don't have time for you right now, now shoo, you hear me? The same to you! Let's have dinner together! Swimming captain, is it? If you ever dare pester me again... I swear you'll kiss your swimming pool goodbye. You free now? Follow me. Where are we going? You think? To "The Woods", of course! Huh? The woods? "The woods" is a metaphor for a certain place for two lovebirds, where they can flutter and tweet... and hum like bees. You Yongci was asking me to the woods! Oh my God! That was too much for an innocent boy like me! Hey! Move it, we have classes later! Uh. We've just known each other, isn't it too soon to go to the woods? You can quit. Wait! I mean... shouldn't we... take it slow? How about we go to a cinema, and watch a movie in peace? What do you think "The Woods" is? Um... You are so simple-minded! When I was 3rd year in grade school, I had admirers! I had 5 girlfriends! I'm a swimming champion, and people like me will take others' metaphors... literally! You won't understand. I don't. But I can take it slow. Good, good. You're getting it. If you feel confused, just come and ask me. Thanks. I'm awesome! You hear me? Awww, what a bummer! Houston Rockets lost 89–94! 7 losses in a row! Yao shouldn't have committed that foul. I tell you, Houston Rockets sucks without Tracy McGrady! You didn't go to the woods today? Mr. Awesome? You had fun in the woods? She meant skewers! Don't fool me, spill it! It's none of your business all right? How can you say so? I'm going to show her that I'm awesome! Lame shark! How dare you look at me! Someone from Class 3 Grade 3 is picking a fight! You really enjoy skewers. And you really enjoy fights. I think you can go and tell Shark that we're dating now. He'd quit pestering you. Can't you pretend? Or those punks won't stop. Pot calling the kettle black. What makes you different? Of course we're different! I'm forced to fight them! When I just transferred here, they'd bully me every day! So I drank lots of milk and practiced fighting daily, and when I became stronger, I fought back. I dislike people who fight all the time. You Yongci! What if I promise I'd never pick a fight again? Zhou Xiaoqi... You're eating with her here? Yeah. We're dating now. Would you let us eat in peace? We're dating? You Yongci belongs to Shark! Zhou Xiaoqi! Be ready to welcome some "surprises" for your last year here! You Yongci belongs to Shark! You Yongci belongs to Shark! You Yongci belongs to Shark! No more fights. Keep your word. Sure thing! Here! My breakfast of love. Looks good, eh? You know we're pretending, right? I know. So I made two. We can share one if we're really dating. Come on! Try it! I'm sure you'll love it! You okay? Lucky I was here to protect you, or you'd get splashed. Look here, all of you. If you think you're more awesome than me, raise your hand. Ok From now on, You're the most awesome, you're second, I'm third. What is the meaning of this? Are you an animal? Do you settle all problems by violence? Or by what? By a swimming race? Sure! If I win, you must never pester You Yongci again! And what if you lose? I'll be at your disposal. If you lose, You Yongci must wear a banner behind her back, which says "I love Shark"! This is just between us, why count her in? No problem. Next Friday, at the routine test match, I'll see your game. Brush up on your swimming! Sure. You Yongci! I'm coming! Fifteen years? That's a long time. I wonder, if 15 years passed... What would we be doing then? If you don't want to starve after 15 years, you should shut your mouth and get on with your studies. "Shut your mouth and get on with your studies." Page 57. 57... Do you take it for granted that as long as you win in swimming, you can go to university? I never thought it that way. But studying is so boring! I'm just like you, I don't like staying in the campus either. I'm not like that, all right? I just don’t like the atmosphere in our class, that's all. Anyway... I see you're studying hard now, what's your plan for the future? I like to draw. I want to be a fashion designer. That's a big goal. Yeah, and it's like swimming too. if you swim without a goal, then aren't you as good as having been tossed into the sea? I have a goal, all right? I must win over Shark to honor you, that's my goal. You two over there! Who let you out of the campus? Hey! Stop! Stop it! What are you doing?! Are you crazy? Cover your face and she won't know who you are! Well, fancy that! You are a movie enthusiast. Nah... My parents bought them for me. How about you pick one to watch? Your clothes need time to dry anyway. You want Cola? I'll get one for you. "Mysterious Universe" Hey, let's watch this one! Don't! That's very boring! Really really boring! Why? It's boring! Trust me! Isn't the universe fascinating? So your parents bought these for you too? They're not mine! They belong to Zhang Fang, and I'm only hiding for him! So this is where your enthusiasm lies. No it's not! That's for the naïve boys! They're meant for fellows who never had a relationship! I don't need it! So, when do you boys start watching porn movies like these? Well... That... Maybe... around 11pm, I think. You meant age... Why did I say 11pm? Why didn't I say 11 years old? Zhou Xiaoqi! Faster! Or you can't get home by 11pm! Come on! Drop that topic! Faster! Right on! Thrusters, thrusters, go! Okay, let me off! Where is your home? Just over there. You hurry back now. You Yongci! What if I lose to Shark in the competition? You won't! You're so confident with me? It's 11pm! Go! Go! Go Xiaoqi! Go! Zhou Xiaoqi! Go! Come on! Come on! Overtake him! Overtake him! You're 3rd place! Nice work! I'm only the 3rd? Surprised, huh? I'm surprised too! You've got talents, all you need is diligence! Boss, you are awesome! As always. Is it hot in here? Convinced yet? Who's the boss? Convinced yet? Who's the boss? Zhou Xiaoqi! Nice performance! You were so excellent! I knew you wouldn't disappoint me! Fan it! Fan it! Faster! Stop it! Remember to write a line here: "To Zhou Xiaoqi's 1st record-breaking". Come off it, you. Don't flatter yourself. I'll tell you what. Last time I told you I had had 5 girlfriends. I was bluffing. I had none. Hey, don't laugh! I knew that already! Was it that obvious? Finished! Show me. Your art is amazing! It'll be yours after I finish coloring. If only we can stay this way forever. Sure! We'll stay this way forever. Hey Hey, watch this! Are you sure that's right? And watch this! Amazing! What? From now on... I can walk you home after school,right? I thought, this embrace had confirmed our relationship. I believed we had only just begun. But it was only my wishful thinking. Gosh! What happened? Everything was smashed! What happened? That drunkard father has followed them here. Poor mother and daughter, they moved here to escape from him... You'll never escape from me... As long as I live! Go. Are you all right? I said, go! I had never expected that You Yongci had a terrible father. What had she been through? What could I do to give her better shelter? Hello? It's me. Are you all right? How's it ? You must have been shocked. That was the aftermath of my father getting drunk. That's why I transferred many times with my mom, to stay away from him. But we didn't expect... that he should find us so soon. Where are you? I'll go find you! Zhou Xiaoqi... It's been a pleasure meeting you. Thank you. Farewell. Hello? Hello? That's how puppy loves go. They start out of nowhere, and end before you can realize. It seems that in the summer that You Yongci left me, a part of my youth had gone with her as well. Admin! Computer No.7 has crashed! Reboot. Admin, over here! Just reboot! Admin! Computer No.18 has crashed! Reboot, dammit! Admin! I told you to reboot! Reboot my ass! Here you go. Thanks. Alright. Aren't you retrying the NCEE exam? What, are you giving up your 3rd try? I'd vomit if I recited more of those historical facts! So I came to chat with you, and get some fresh air outside. I thought you were preparing for STEM. Why are you switching to liberal arts? Silly. I'll tell you why: STEM schools don't have any girls! As for liberal arts schools... girls everywhere! Oh my gosh, that's an iPhone! Your father's spa center must be making some fortune! I wonder if he secretly offered escort service...? Nonsense! Look here. In this university, wherever you look, there are beauties! Look! You Yongci? Huh? You Yongci! Hold it, buddy! Modern trick: pinch to zoom! Is it her? It is her! You Yongci! It's her! It's her! Love ya! Dad! Mom! I'll retry! I want to go to university! Parade, P-A-R-A-D-E. Congratulation Father How the heck did you get a negative angle? I say your chance of going to university is negative! Go back and be a lousy admin! Who's gonna be a lousy admin? What's your problem with negatives? I solved it! I solved it! It's 30! Is it correct? "Degrees", it's "30 Degrees"! On your marks! In the summer of 2009, I walked out of the NCEE exam room once again, and towards the university that I had never dared to dream of. I knew if it wasn't for her sake, couldn't have made it so far. Beauties! I'm coming for you! I'm coming, You Yongci! Here, it's our dormitory's first meal together, it'll be my treat. So instead of having some local dishes, we're having skewers? Zhou Xiaoqi chose here. He was like mad looking for a girl, who happened to enjoy the skewers here. So he expects to see her here? Exactly. Have you found that girl? What's her name? We can probably help. You Yongci. Did you say "Swimming Pool"? You are quite a typical athlete! It's You-Yong-Ci. You have an accent too? I... Forget it, let's drink. All together now! I'll go bottoms up. Did we buy too much beer? Not at all! It's too funny! Li Meng left a comment on Li Le's timeline. I didn't expect. Zhou Xiaoqi? What are you doing here? Li Meng left a comment on Li Le's timeline. When did they get to know each other? Fancy that! Huh, they... Huh. And the comment was "Wish you happy and check my timeline too". You Yongci! Zhou Xiaoqi? What are you doing here? Does your major... require a very high level of English reading? It's not English, it's Italian. I wanted to apply for a university in Milan after I graduate. How about you? You hated studying. How did you end up here? If The Woods can become a franchise, I can go to university too. It was a piece of cake for me and my friend Zhang Fang. To make it better, you're here too! Coming through. Excuse me. It's okay. I think it's destiny. Members of the Girls' Department, assemble for meeting! Oh, sure. I'm kind of busy today. But I can treat you sometime! No problem! It's a deal then. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Please fill in the form. Zhou Xiaoqi? What are you doing? To sign up, of course! Hey, wait for me! Will this do? Signing up for the Girls' Department? Yeah, I just did. So I can accompany you more, right? You must be hungry. Let's eat together! Zhou Xiaoqi... I'm already dating somebody. Prepare for combat! One! I've asked my sources. Her boyfriend is Chen Hao'er, chief of the student union and captain of the soccer team. He's a varsity hot shot! Two! If you ask me, I'd say there are plenty of girls to choose from, don't let her be your only game! Three! I think you should think in reverse: if she's dating nobody, then every guy could be your rival. Four! But now she has a steady date, so this guy will be your only rival. Five! Makes sense. That really makes sense! Zhou Xiaoqi! Yes sir! Fall out! Hey, hey, You Yongci! You Yongci! How did I do? Not bad. I practiced quite a bit! Now entering the players. Home Team Huaxing University vs. Away Team Zhongnan University. Captain of Away Team is No.5, Wang Enyu. -Your clothing design is amazing. Thanks. Captain of Home Team is No.10, Chen Hao'er. Look! It's your boyfriend! He's so handsome! Chen Hao'er! Chen Hao'er! Hua Xing! Come on! Don't lose him! Follow up! Quick! To the position! Quick! Over there! Defense! Break through! Don't lose him! Nice shot! How was it? Did you get hurt? No. Have some water. You performance was excellent! Are you tired? I can manage. Whoa, Zhou Xiaoqi! You look extra sexy in this outfit! How about you be my girlfriend? Shut up. Don't lose your temper. Big bro here will treat you good! Stay in the shade and don't get a sunstroke. After the match, let's go out and get some snacks. Don't look at that. Don't look. Don't look. Just don't look. Does Zhou Xiaoqi have a girlfriend? I don't think so. Why? I don't want to miss my chance! Why the long face? I was only asking in a friend's stead. It's fine if you don't like her! Well, thank you so much for being nice! But no thanks! I can do it on my own. I came here and joined the Girls' Department, because I want girls! And I'm telling you... I'm tellng you! Girls' Department is only my first step! I'll run for the Student Union's chief next year! What's so great about being the chief anyway? How do you run for the chief's position? By getting 3 F's? Or a dismissal warning from the swimming team? Stop fooling around. You sacrificed so much to get in here, can't you pay attention to your studies and training? "Are you care me"? Your grammar sucks. Help! -Give back the money! Stop! Give back the money! I hate man who beats up a woman! -Help! Help! She's a swindler! I don't know him! What do you think you're doing? It's okay. What faculty are you from? Shall I call the police? Uh, there's no need. I'm Zhou Xiaoqi, secretary in the Girls' Department. If you need help, come and find me. Thank you. You're both very kind. What are you doing? Lock the door! Quick, quick. You'll know when you watch it! It starts! I brushed up on my Japanese to find it for you! Little Xiaoqi! Go for it! I mean, you, have been too obsessed with that girl recently. For the sake of brotherhood, we must help you. we all chipped in to get you this special gift. You thought it's love between you and Yongci, but... the most common mistake in every man's youth is to mistake passion for love. That's right! Let it all out and you'll be fine! Just as we were picking it up, You Yongci happened to pass by, so we asked her to sign on it! Here, it's her signature! Now your treasure's been doubled! Let's watch! Zhou Xiaoqi! Open up! Police! Is it illegal to buy porn movies? Police! Open up! Yes sir. Zhou Xiaoqi, you must go with us. What's happening? What the... Why is You Yongci involved too? I really had nothing to do with it! I know it. Because she signed on it! Look what you've done! So you can't wait until 11pm now? You have to watch it at 11am? I didn't buy that thing! Right. We have the accomplices of that swindler woman. Please let her go, Mr. Police. She's not involved in this. Please! That's left for us to decide. And I don't need your opinions here, you hear? I'm just a juvenile with my needs... I can be forgiven for this, can't I? Forgiven? You could go to jail! Go to jail? How... How can that be? How can it not be? Spill it. What's you two's relationship... with that woman? Relationship? From online. If you have to ask... More like a... service provider and buyer relationship, I think. Buyer?? What did you say?? You bought escort service on the internet?? You pervert! How dare you! Who taught you this?! That escalated quickly! We're on a big case! What other foul things are you hiding from me?! It's outrageous to fight in the police station! That swindler woman has been arrested. You two stay here and don't make a fuss, when we're done investigating, you may leave. Hey. Does it hurt? It sure does! How about you give me a massage? How did you start dating with Chen Hao'er? This is it. In you go. Thanks. Hello? "Hello" yourself! How dare you not answer my phone! Dad, I'm having an exam. Stop bothering me! On my entrance exam, I was so nervous that I knocked my art tools over. Clear your mind. Focus on your exam. You can do it! I felt there was something special about him. See you in school by September! He could calm my mind with merely a few words. I thought... he was the one who could give me the most sense of security. Zhao Xiaoqi... I've been moving countless times since I was small. I've never had many close friends. I hope... I can have you as a close friend for life. I had thought that as long as I went all out to go to university, and rushed to her side at all costs, I could stay with her forever. But I had never thought of what she really needed. Zhou Xiaoqi, what happened to you? You're improving fast! Keep it up! Maybe I can refer you to the provincial team. Sure. Thank you, coach! At the age of 21, I didn't know what else I could do. Except for following what You Yongci had told me, to work hard and be a better swimmer. I felt that even though a goal had revealed itself before me, I still felt empty inside. I didn't know if there were love paradoxes for every person in love. For instance, I was thinking of her the whole time, but didn't dare to disturb her, unless I had a good reason. Hello? You're not partying? It's your birthday today, right? You're not out for fun? No, I'm not. So it's just you then? I have a cold and don't feel so well. I'm in my dormitory. How do you feel right now? Is it bad? It's just a fever. It'll go away with a good sleep, I think. So... No birthday parties? I had planned to watch fireworks in the downtown with Chen Hao'er. But I'm sick. So change of plans. Sure, okay. Have a good rest then. Thank you. For remembering my birthday. Okay, bye. Bye. Jiang Baoyun! I love you! Jiang Baoyun! Can I... ask you to study with me tomorrow? Shi Qian! You've been cold to me! But I can't help loving you! I love you too! Bai Lin! All the world knows that I love you! All the world, except you! Tan Jing! Let's get married when we graduate! Zhao Zixi! I can't live without you! Would you give me a second chance? Maybe you never knew Since the day you said "I love you" Here in my sky Stars started to glow You Yongci! Happy birthday! I secretly hoped that many years later, she'd still remember the glamorous fireworks and sea of glowing lights, so this happy moment would be with her forever. Even if there'd be someone missing in it... which would be me. What do you do when you're free? I travel. Me too! What a coincidence! Where do you usually go? It depends. I've traveled at home and abroad. Where are you going this summer? I don't have a set destination yet. Come to Sanya then! My family owns a hotel there by the sea. After playing this friendly match, we'll go together. Are you sure...? Get the ball! Defense! Defense! And Chen Hao'er isn't playing at his best either! Yeah. What's gotten into him? I feel Chen Hao'er is throwing the game. Thanks to his teammate, we have a goal. Totally. Have some water. Do your best. Yeah, you should! I heard if we win the game, you lovebirds will take a trip to Sanya! I hope so. Chen Hao'er. Come. I'm off. Follow me. What? What are you doing? Are you sure you want to travel with him? He was mingling with another girl! He promised to take her to Sanya too, you know? He was fooling you around! He won't win this game! Zhou Xiaoqi! This is not funny! I have only one question: would you rather believe me, or him? I'm not talking to you. Why can't I play?! We are a men's team! So what? I'm a man! But you work for the Girls' Department! What's wrong about that?! It's okay, we're on the same campus. Let him play. Ball! Ball! Pass over here! That was clearly a foul! Hey! Referee! How could you miss that?! Run! Fill the opening! Defense! Chang Fan! Pass! Zhou Xiaoqi! Some say puppy love will make you reckless. But as a young adult, the only thing I could give her was my reckless courage. On that day, I learned that the competition for love is another thing: I could give it all to win in a match for her sake, but I could not win her heart the same way. So this was my only way to settle it there and then. Keep it down! No fighting! No fighting! Don't pick a fight! I had promised her not to fight anymore. But I broke my promise. I knew for sure that my punch had smashed her affection for me to pieces. From then onward, we never spoke again. For the second time, she disappeared from my life. There were many things happened in the past few years. China's swimming team triumphed from the London Olympics, Germany demolished Brazil in the World Cup semifinal by a crazy 7–1 score, countless Chimaek restaurants came along out of nowhere, consecutive shopping sprees on Nov 11th and Dec 12th, as if they wanted to milk every last cent from your wallet. I upgraded to iPhone 5S, the newest model then, I downloaded Wechat and got in touch with many old friends, despite I never had any news about You Yongci. Heck. And I was on the Provincial team. No kidding, this time I really was a star on the team! Zhang Fang opened up a bar using his father's funding, and from time to time we'd get together at his bar. Chen Chen entered a law firm, Chang Fan became one of the first Wechat shopowners, and I just had a girlfriend named He Xiaohui, who was a very good girl. Excuse me, I have a phone call to make. Okay, okay. Ah, I got that. She's a good girl, and from a rich family too! Listen, you gotta marry her, don't be shy about it. Hey, lawyer, suppose her family has bought her a new home before the marriage, can Xiaoqi get a share if they divorce? Come to me for help! I can secure his half share of the property, and cut him a great deal! Do you have to be so mean? We've just begun! Don't make cruel jokes like that! Yeah, right. Money will his least concerns anyway. He's on the provincial team now, someday, he'll be the national champion, then beautiful girls will rush to him, and commercial deals will fly in nonstop! Hey Xiaoqi, with your ability, you can probably work in the Sports Bureau after you retire, right? I don't care when I'll end up. But before I retire... I want to be a champion. Hey buddy! We have a new gym open! 25-meter swimming pool with central ventilation! We have pro coaches here too! Check it out! 25-meter lane is too short. Turning make me dizzy. He can be the coach of your coach, you know? See you tomorrow then. See you tomorrow. Bye. Try it. Try this. How was that? It's good. Try mine. This is my favorite dessert shop. We can come here every day then. Mm-hmm. What's your plan for later? Go to the movies? I'll pay the bills. Wait for me here. Mm-hmm. When did you become a model? Since last year. Wang Yuke opened a shop online, so I helped as a model. Then I gained some popularity, so I went on doing it. You need to advertise yourself, get your account verified and get some followers. What's your Wechat? I'll add you to contacts. Sure. You're still using your old nickname! I wasn't fond of changing it, you know. Hey look at you, you are using you old profile avatar! Dinner together tonight? You're in a relationship? Yeah. We've been together for half a year. How about you? I didn't dare to. You knew I was terrible at finding out a playboy. I heard you had gone to study in Italy after graduation. When did you return? My father suddenly fell severely sick, so, change of plans. Had to look after him. He's my dad anyway. How's your father now? Well, he'll manage. What's wrong? I have a shooting tomorrow. The crew told me they could pick me up in their car, but now they can't. I'm free these days. How about... I drive you there with Zhang Fang's car? Nah. Don't bother. Let's see it this way: you pay for the fuel, and I accompany you for a ride. No, really. It's really fine with me! It's a deal! Here. Help! House chores are hijacking me! No fear, for I'm here! Who are you? I... am your Leader! Fashionable design & fun to use! We bring vogue to your home appliance! Leader! Cut! Cut! Cut! Can't you use a happier tone when you say "Leader"? Leader. Leader. Leader. Leader. Hurry up and tie her up! It's getting late! I'm sorry. I was too tired. It's okay. I'm off then. See you in two days. Uh, wait a minute! Here. I asked... my friend to collect these. There are some job listings for fashion brands. Both full-time and internship. Take a look at it. I hope it'll help. Actually... I think you're doing well. But, still, I find a designer's job fits you better. Because I find it really cool when you're drawing. Hello, Director? I'm almost there. I'm replaced? Wait, what? Why didn't you inform me of it? Hello? Hello? Hello? I'm sorry... Let's turn back. Why are we here? Just get off and you'll know. Well. Let's head back. It's locked. Come. No. What if we get caught? Then so be it. We've been in police station anyway! Scenic? Enjoy it. "Who am I?" "I'm your Leader!" "Cut! Cut! Cut! You can't act like that!" "Say it with a little happier tone!" Some director! What a douchebag! Director! Aren't you a douchebag? Then just blacklist him! I've never expected that after all these years, I could climb over a wall with you. Well, it was you who taught me this. You remember that? Of course I do. I remember every bit of it. Besides, when I swam every day, they'd shout "Swimming Pool" around me. So I couldn't forget! I remember too, you know? When I see someone picking a fight, I'd think, what would you be doing then? And of course, at 11pm... Gah! How... What the... You haven't forgotten that? Don't say it! Don't say it! At 11pm,-No,no I'd think... -Oh please! Zhou Xiaoqi must be busy doing stuff! You asked for it! Don't you run! Hey, hold it! Hey, hold it! You're so done when I catch you! Come off it.-Where are you going? Ever since our first meet to this very moment, we had always ended up in an awkward timing. As if life itself had been pranking on us. Will our crossed paths... part ways again? The qualification trial is next week! If you want to go to the national championship, it's your only chance, so give it all you got! You Yongci The competition on Saturday. I've reserved a ticket for you It's a very important... match for my life. And I hope you'll come to watch. Where are our seats? Here. Here they are! Got it, here we are. See how late you are? The rain was heavy! Roads were flooded! We're lucky to be here. I could have picked you up! Why didn’t you say so earlier? This will the biggest typhoon landfall that the city saw in 5 years. According to forecast... We have an emergency broadcast: Heavy flooding under the flyover on E Stadium Rd. Around 20 vehicles are trapped, passengers of which are mostly coming for the swimming championship tonight. Some trapped drivers have informed the police that the water's seeping into their vehicles, and doors are squeezed shut by excessive water pressure. The situation is critical. The rescue team is en route to the location, and we'll update as the rescue situation develops. Please exercise extra caution if you're going out. Contestants for the Men's 800m freestyle, please check in at the Registration Hall. Hello? Are you here? Zhou Xiaoqi will defeat every opponent! Hello? Yeah, I‘ll be here after passing the flyover. But the engine's stalled in the heavy rain! Don't worry about me, go on... Water is seeping in! Get off now! Water is in? Hey driver, why can't I open the door? On your marks! Hey driver, why can't I open the door? If you want to go to... ...the national championship... ...it's your only chace. Some trapped drivers have informed the police of water leaking into their cars. and doors are squeezed shut by excessive water pressure. ...the situation is critical. But before I retire, I want to be a champion. Zhou Xiaoqi! He's nuts! Where is he going? Why are you here? Your number was unavailable and I feared the worst! My phone dropped in the water! The taxi stalled, and I didn't want to miss your match so I ran here! I know I was being reckless, but I really feared the worst could happen! I'm out of that relationship. You Yongci... Since our first meet up till now, our paths have parted too many times. And I don't want to lose you again. I'll ask you one more time: Are you willing to be my girlfriend? Trust me. I'll always be there beside you. I'll never break your heart. Let's go to the venue. See if you'll have another chance. Zhou Xiaoqi! Zhou Xiaoqi! Zhou... Zhou Xiaoqi! Zhou Xiaoqi! How are you going to swim now? No big deal, I'll retire. It's no time to laugh! Don't you want to be a champion? It does not matter... But your wellness does. Turning, turning. In September 2015, You Yongci passed an interview of a fashion design company. And we finally moved to live together. I told you the table was too big! But you insisted on buying it! You're a designer now! With all those drawing work, you'll surely use a big table! Watch the back, watch the back! Don't get it scratched or my heart will ache! You're not going to ache over it! Here, here. Attention, on three. One, two, three! You Yongci was constantly busy working late into the night. And I liked it to just stay by her side, and share all my happiness with her. I'll drink this one! Yuck! Too sour! Reading? What are you reading? And I worked as a swimming coach at a gym. See you, coach. See you next training. It was a temporary job during my rehabilitation. Zhou Xiaoqi! What are you doing here? I'm here to take you home. Grandpa! I'd like a haircut. Okay, you're next. Okay. You like those? I'll order them for our wedding. As long as I marry you, dresses are not of my concerns! Oh, right! What is it? What's this? I planned to give it to you when we get home. But the atmosphere here is so right, so, here it is. Put it on my finger. I wanted to buy this pair of rings for a long time. So I bought them right after receiving my bonus today! How did you know what ring will fit my finger? Because I hold your hand every day. I'll wear it every day! When we get married, I'll get you a big diamond ring! Here. At the age of 26, I was having the best time of my life. I was so happy as to forget all worries in life. Or rather... I intentionally neglected them. Upwards. More upwards. With force. Yeah. Now swing your arm. Slowly. Right, push my hand, with force. More force! Good! Very nice, more force. How was it, doctor? I've spent a year with rehabilitation now, can I go on swimming? From what I see now, you've recovered fairly well. It shouldn't affect you too much for your daily activities. However, if you mean to carry on your athlete career, I'm afraid you can't. Your rotator cuff's injured, your tendon's ruptured, along with severe scarring. It's next to impossible if you want them to recover to what they used to be. Well Is there any alternative treatment? For his status now, an operation will not help much either. Greetings. Can I interest you in our gym? Greetings. No thanks. No, no, no. Join us today. Hi. Can I interest you in our gym? I'm a pro athlete. I can guarantee you, it's really a nice gym. Don't fool me. Why would a pro athlete do such a job? You paid the rent to our landlord? Mm-hmm. How could he do this? We had a deal I'd pay him by next week's payday! How could he request the rent from you? Come on! It doesn't matter who's paying. But he's breaking our deal! Why didn't you tell me before you pay him? Well... Alright! I'll let you pay next month, and you can pay six months in a row. Are you happy now? Please? Fine. You said we're going to dinner. Why bring me here? Season's changing, you need some new clothes for yourself. There's no need. I can buy clothes online. Well, since you're here, just give it a try. Well, this one. Thanks, but it's too expensive. Come on! It's not that much. Try it on, please? Come on. Come on. Fine. Try it. Do you like it? It's my first design that's on mass production! I do! I do like it. I'll buy it at once. Hello. -I've paid for it already! It's my present to you. You... You keep giving me presents. Aren't you going to spoil me? Yes, I intend to. Let me get changed first. There's another thing I'd like to discuss with you. Hmm. The company offers to send me to Milan for a two-year study. Oh. Really? That's good. That's very good. I don't mean I've taken their offer. I want to hear your thoughts first. Take it. Of course you should take it. If I were you, a I'd be sitting in Italynd eating pizzas already! Let's go. A woman just purchased my swimming course today. Let's celebrate. To our... flourishing careers! It was a premium wedding dress, and it costed us another 5 grand! I told him we could do without it, but he insisted! Hey Zhou Xiaoqi, why don't you two get wed soon? Tell the photographer I referred you, you'll have a discount! We haven't planned that yet. Chang Fan! Don't rush them! Xiaoqi is in a transition period, and he lacked money. So of course his wedding could wait. My bad. I think it's the contrary. You can earn red envelopes from wedding, right? That's it! It's time to know investment and reward. Xiaoqi, buddy, I think you two should wed soon, before worries find you. I don't have anything to worry about! Look at you! Dating a rich man's daughter who studied overseas, and got yourself an awkward foreign name, what was it? "Cheney"? You are the one who should marry soon, or worries will find you! Xiaoqi, what's the matter with you? Well, I think we'll congratulate to Chang Fan and his newly wed wife! Among the four of us, he's certainly doing very great! Don't flatter me. He bought a home with his money alone! Outstanding! Zhou Xiaoqi? Yeah, right. He'd give anything to earn money! Have you seen any decent man selling facials? Have you? "Look at me! My face is so moist!" Stop that! What's wrong with you?! Chang Fan... Yeah, everything is wrong with me! Or why would I come here?! Pretending to be a rich snob and make a fool of myself? Stop drinking! He's drunk. I'll take him for a walk. i'm not drunk. Come on! Come! You alright? As fine as ever! I shouldn't have gone to that meetup. Look at me, I don't even have a decent job! I'm not going... to a meetup that I'm unfitted for! It'll disturb them, and it'll disturb myself. I'm sorry. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have injured, and ended up like this. No. I am good-for-nothing. Zhou Xiaoqi... Mm-hmm? Shall we get married? Get married? How can I get married like this? I can't even give you a proper wedding! Very funny. Let's go. I have more CVs to send. Is your mother coming? She's not. She won't forgive my father. I was drunk. Sorry for my stupid talks. Nah, I couldn't care less! I'll be off then. Take care of Yongci. Thanks for coming today. Bye. I'll stay with him a little longer. Sure. Now now. Tell me. What's on your mind? Nothing. Spill it! You've been wearing that long face for a while. I failed at the interview again. They said I was unfit. It's kind of funny... When I prepared my CV on graduation, I wanted to write "be a swimming champion" as my personal ideal. If I do that now, they'd look at me like an idiot. Who could have known... that I'd miss that chance when it was one step away. What would I be doing now if I had never met Yongci? You'd never have gone to university and ended up being a computer admin for life. Screw you. I mean after graduation. If I never met her after graduating... could my body have stayed unscathed? Could I... have ended up in a better situation? It's too late to regret now. But I fear... I fear if someday, when I'm faced with a desperate situation, I'll regret what I'd chosen, and regret having met her. So that's it? You regret now? I'll go to the shop. I didn't mean that. But I fear I'd think that way. So this is the true reason why you can't be honest with me. I'm sorry. So that's it. In the face of hardships, you'll regret having met me. Just like my father, who blamed every hardship on my mother and me, all his life! He always thought we were obstacles to his goal! I didn't mean it. It was my fault. Please don't take it personally. I've never had any sense of security since I was small... until I met you again, you told me face to face, that you'd never break my heart. And I believed you. That's why I faced those toughest times with you, I've never doubted you! I've always believed you were my right partner for life. But then I heard you say you regret, with my own ears! I've been so wrong. Please forgive me. It was my fault. I'll listen to you, I'll prepare for the teacher's certification exam, and go to interview for a sports coach. Trust me. Everything's going to turn all right. I've decided to go to Milan. I'm leaving next week. That's great! That's really great! Just go. I'm totally with you. I'll wait here for you, I won't touch another girl. That's my self-punishment. I'll learn Italian in the meantime, so I can visit you when school's off in summer and winter! Why did you... I apologize. It was my fault! I'd do anything for you as long as you forgive me! Zhou Xiaoqi... Even though I can forgive you, the word "regret" from you keeps reminding me that I don't know how to face you anymore. If we just move on like this, our lives will probably revolve around "regrets" forever. Neither of us is as strong as we thought we'd be. But I just want to be with you for life! Me too. Sadly, neither of us can now. It was my fault! Please forgive me, will you? Please forgive me! Please forgive me... Good luck with your interview. For the sake of your ideal life... and for once, not for the sake of me. Will you stop it? Are you crazy?! Get lost! You want to fight?! Dear Zhou Xiaoqi: Despite the long time together, neither of us had the courage to touch your old scar, the one that deprived you of your dream. It's a physical scar on you, and a mental scar in my heart. I'd do anything, as long as I can make it up to you, but I couldn't do anything helpful. So... the one that should regret is me, not you. I regret not having stayed with you in high school, regret not having seen how nice you were in university, regret having wasted so much time... that we could have spent together. Whenever I see your scar, I can't help thinking of these regrets. It's a shame that life cannot rewind. So, to spare our love from the erosion of discontent, I believe it's better that we let go here and now. Last but not least, I want to tell you, Zhou Xiaoqi, the only thing I've never regretted is having been together with you. I didn’t know which was more painful. to never have something, or to have it but only to lose it. When I was 28, I lost You Yongci. And my life seemed to have reverted to its starting point overnight. The next year after You Yongci had left me, I obtained my teacher's certification. Isn't it ironic? A boy who used to play hooky and pick up fights, is now a teacher himself! I finally got to know what a headache I had been for my class teacher. Meanwhile, I experienced a sense of fullness and honor like never before. Oh, you bad boys! I'm not going! Why should I attend it? I'm telling you, you'd better keep an eye on me! Don't let me go, even if means to saw off my legs! Of course. You're not going. None of us are going. And you can't escape anyway! Look around you! I hand-picked this place for you, it's surrounded by the sea! And I've spoke to the village head as well, he'll lock all the boats in the dock, so none of us are leaving! We have three packs of beer here for all of us! Done yet? Done! The buffalo wings and oysters are all ready. Come on! Try Chef Chen's cuisine! I'll have a buffalo wing! Put it on my finger. I'll wear it every day! When we get married, I'll get you a big diamond ring! Get up! Get up! Get up! What's wrong? Up! Up! What's wrong? Get up! I'm going to her wedding! That's my final chance! You want to kidnap the bride? You said you'd saw off your legs than to go to her wedding! Get dressed! There's no time! What have you been drinking? My glasses! Move! -Where are my glasses? Hell knows where your glasses are! Over your side! Hurry up! Boat! Any boat around here? Any ferry? Anyone? Any ferry around? Let's hurry! Now, Xiaoqi, keep it cool. We're going all out for you today. Now when you get in there, go directly to the bride, snatch her and leave! We'll watch your back. Even if the groom charges at us with a machete, we won't flee, and we'll fend him off for you! My bros. I'm counting on you. Leave it to us! Greetings! Greetings to you! You look familiar... No, you must have mistaken. We have a rehearsal checklist to check before the real thing. A rehearsal? Yeah, yeah, yeah. What rehearsal? Pleae excuse us. Zhou Xiaoqi? It's you, isn't it? No wonder why they all suddenly left. I'm a master thief! I can always manage to steal a few minutes from the bride. You look wonderful in the wedding dress. Thank you for coming. I used to be a fool, worring over the future, while wasting the present. But today... I don't want any more regrets. Your looks are different now. You're more mature. I even had a feeling of jamais vu when I saw you... As if... having loved you were an ancient story from my past life. But then you called me, by my name... Then in a fleeting moment, I was back to when I was seventeen. It felt like... I had just finished swim training, and we had only been apart for one class period. It's been a long time... Fifteen years from then on. Yeah. In my heart, there's always something that I never dared to tell you. Until now. You Yongci... having met you is the best thing that had ever happened in my life. It was you who made a man out of a childish boy, which was me. My youth was mostly wasted on brawls. But there was one brawl that I would remember for life, because that brawl... was my first time meeting you. Ever since then, all I could think of was that I wanted to be with you. Brawls? Playing hooky? They didn't matter anymore. All that mattered was you. To be with you, I had burnt myself out on studies so that I could go to the university you attended and be together with you. I also did tons of... stupid, reckless things. But I was lucky. Because we had loved each other so much. If I could have grown up earlier, I'd probably have never lost you, right? I'd never... forgive myself... for having said I had regretted. How could I have regretted? All the happiness that had filled my youth were thanks to you. I've seen all your faces before — happy ones, and sad ones. And today, I'm here to see... your face before me, because it's a face... that will never ever belong to me. For all the partings we had, I had never properly said goodbye to you. But now, it's time. Farewell, the girl who had been there for me through 15 years. Thank you, for having walked into my life. From this day onward, please promise me, you'll smile, and live happily ever after. Zhou Xiaoqi... One may meet many people through life, but there won't be another one like the first love. We had loved each other wholeheartedly. Despite how we ended, it was still a memorable journey, don't you think? Thank you. Thank you for these 15 years. You Yongci! Happy birthday! Fifteen years? That's a long time. If 15 years passed... What would we be doing then? From now on... We'll walk into our new lives, and try to live happily ever after. In 2021, the love story between me and You Yongci finally came to a close. On that day, I used my eyes to take many pictures of her, everything is about her walking the path into her happiness.
