[birds chirping] [male narrator] Every year Spring brought its special magic to Waltons' mountain. As the dogwood and redbud came into blossom the very earth seemed to vibrate and burst into life. In the spring of 1947 no one felt this more deeply than Mary Ellen. Our mother was still recuperating in an Arizona Sanatorium. And as Mary Ellen's wedding day approached her joy was only dimmed by our mother's absence. For it was in such times of celebration that we most keenly missed her. [Olivia] 'Western Union.' 'Yes, I'd like to send a telegram.' 'Yes.' To Mary Ellen Willet. Waltons mountain, Virginia. "My darling Mary Ellen "how I wish I could be with you tomorrow "to see you and Jonesy walk down the isle together. "But the miles that separate us cannot keep my love and prayers from you." [Mary Ellen] '"I wish I could send you some magic formula' '"that would keep your marriage happy forever.' '"But I can't.' '"Besides, marriage is made up of mountains and valleys' '"and we need the valleys to better appreciate the peaks'' May you have your share of both. Love, mom." That's really nice. I can't wait for you to meet momma. If she doesn't get better soon we'll just have to go see her. You mean that? Sure, Arizona's not so far away. I love you. [bell ringing] [pipe organ music] - Congratulations. - Thank you, thank you. - Welcome to the family. - Thank you. Alright, let's all go home and celebrate. See you over at the house. Folks, listen up here. I'd like to propose a toast. A long and happy life together 'to Mr. and Mrs. Arlington Westcott Jones III.' 'In other words to Mary Ellen and Jonesy.' [all] Cheers! Thank you, John. And I would like to drink to my beautiful wife. And also to Mr. Harry Philpot.. ...of Harry's Used Cars in Deadeye Gulch, Nevada. [crowd laughing] Because without the lemon of a car he sold me I never would have had an accident and never would have met Mary Ellen had her nurse me back to health and on to matrimony! [crowd cheering] You know compared to Mary Ellen I'm practically an old married woman by now. Don't you think we should start planning our second honeymoon? Wait till we finish this merry time on the contract sure? Maybe. - Want some more punch? - No, thanks. - How about you? - No, thanks. - No? - Mm-hmm. Would you like to sit down? - Ha ha ha. - Ha ha ha. Ben, it's two months before this baby's born. Please don't start mollycoddling me yet. - See you in a while. - Okay. See if we can help along with some of that recipe, huh. - Oh, good idea. - Ha ha ha. Won't have too much of this for the next month. - With all that work we've got. - Yeah. Think we can drive the first load by Wednesday? Think so. Wednesday would be great. Cindy's mother's coming by for a visit that afternoon. You don't seem too thrilled. It's hard to be thrilled about a woman who gave up Cindy for adoption. I'm sure she had her reasons, Ben. Oh, I'm sure. How did she finally find Cindy after all these years? She didn't. Cindy went looking for her. Found her living in a Washington Suburb married to a wealthy man. First, the woman denied being her mother. - Hurt Cindy a lot. - Well, they finally made up. Oh, yeah. And who knows. I may even learn to like her. Being Cindy's mother she can't be all that bad. Let's go. [people chattering] I'm really looking forward to my graduation. Mine wasn't that exciting. Corabeth and I didn't come. Some little emergency at the store. Do you have any of the Baldwin's recopied? This juice is bland. Aimee, I'd like you to meet the Reverend and Mrs. Marshall. - This is my daughter, Aimee. - Hi, Aimee. Nice to meet you. If you'll excuse me. I promised Mary Ellen I'll keep an eye on John-Curtis. Aimee just graduated from the Warwick Preparatory school and she's their outstanding art pupil. Congratulations. I'd love to see some of your work. We could use some nice paintings around the church. I don't do religious art. [Ike] 'She's the best drawer I ever saw.' She can do people, trees, fruit. It all works. Does your talent come from your father's or your mother's branch of the family tree. Neither. Ike and Corabeth adopted me. It was the smartest move we made. Bet it was. Anybody wanna help putting this sign on the Jeep? - I will. - Okay. It's been ages since I've seen you. How do you manage to stay so incredibly young? Oh, I don't know. You've sure changed. Remember a few years ago I had a crush on you? How could I forget something like that? Wasn't I the silliest thing? Oh, I didn't think so. James Robert, if I didn't know better. I'd say we're flirting. - Me? - Uh-huh. Ha ha. Help me with this. Such a shame. That your mother and John-Boy could not attend the nuptials. Well, John-Boy couldn't leave his job in New York. Where are you and Arlington planning on spending your honeymoon? Jonesy said he's found us a great camp site. Oh, well. I hope it's somewhere near 5th Avenue and 59th Street. As a matter of fact it's somewhere along the James river. Don't worry. We love camping. It'll be a perfect honeymoon. This is Jones. Time to get changed. Ready in a minute, Mr. Jones. - Excuse me, Corabeth. - Bye, Corabeth. Jonesy, I thought you two would be long gone by now. Well, as soon as I get my wife, I guess we'll be off. Wife. Ha ha. What a great word. That is a good word, isn't it? So will you be going back to Olivia soon? Yeah, as soon as I fill that Maritown Contract. You must miss her very much. Yeah, I do. Well, I think both of you have an awful lot of courage. We get it from each other. That's one of the best parts of being married. I want some more cake. John-Curtis, do you wanna get as fat as Santa Claus? - Yeah. - Ha ha. Don't worry, John-Curtis. There'll be plenty of leftovers. John-Curtis, there's your momma. Johnny, come here. - I'll see you soon. - Come to grandpa. Now you and your grandpa behave yourselves. We'll try. Don't forget your bouquet. - Okay, Elizabeth. - Bye, Jonesy. Bye, mom. Bye-bye. [crowd cheering] - Bye, Jonesy. Bye, mom. - Bye-bye. - Goodbye. - Bye, daddy. Be happy, honey. You take care of her now, Jonesy. - We're outta here. - Bye, careful now. [pleasant music] [fire crackling] What is this here? We have something for you. Hmm. Oh. It's lovely. Is there something in it? It is up to you to find something to put in it. Maybe you'd like a lock of my hair. I think I'd rather have a picture of you on one side and John-Curtis on the other. I guess that'll work until we start having more children. After I finish medical school. I think we should first have a little girl. Johnny would like that. I know, I always wanted a baby sister. Or a baby brother. Or an older sister or an older brother. Don't worry, John-Curtis will not be an only child. I can just see our little girl. See, she'll have.. ...your nose...your chin, your brow, my eyes-- What's wrong with my eyes? Nothing but, she's gotta have some of my looks. And otherwise, what would the neighbors think? How about your nose? - Ha ha ha. - My nose? You honestly want our darling little girl to have this? - No. Ha ha ha. - Okay, okay. Of course, if we have little boy first then...we've got to think of something to name him other than Arlington Westcott Jones IV. Good. Good? You don't like my name? I love your name. Arlington. My darling Arlington. My ardent Arlington. - My darling, ardent-- - Stop, stop, stop. Arlington my darling-- [orchestra music] [birds chirping] [orchestra music] I think you like Drew. He's a dream buff. Mm, personally I find college freshman terribly immature. He's almost a soft one. Mm, I like men who are more worldly and sophisticated. Do you meet them at school? Dana, my art professor is worldly. He's also a great artist. I inspire him, and he, me. So, you see I'm beyond young men like Drew. Although I'm sure he's very sweet. He's also pretty terrific. I wish I was at his school so I'd have more time to spend with him and you too. You can't have all that much work left. There are final exams and I also have a final essay. Haven't even started writing it. They still give those dreary assignments? I've to describe what sorta person I wanna be when I grow up. Oh, that'll be easy. I'll be a great artist. And devote my life to art...and love. - That'll be exciting. - Ha ha ha. [orchestra music] Hi. Missed you so much. Aimee, this is Drew. Aimee Godsey. - Aimee, Drew Caller. - Hi, nice to meet you. Hi. Coffee, bread and what else? Uh, worms.. ...for the fish. Hey, wait a minute. This is ridiculous. This is our honeymoon. You-you can't go off grocery shopping. The first time in our married life that we've been apart. It's too early for a separation. I'm coming with you. No, you stay here and try and catch us some supper. - Hurry back - First, let me go. - No. - Yes. - Love you. - Love you. [engine revving] Bye. [dramatic music] [screams] [glass shatters] [female #3] 'Doctor Harper. Doctor Kell Harper.' 'Emergency..' [soft music] - Jonesy, how is she? - She's in shock. The doctors are in there. They may let us know something soon. What happened? Well, she went off in the jeep and somehow God knows she crashed. By the time I got to the hospital she was unconscious. Dr. Coleman. Mary Ellen suffered a bad puncture wound. We've stopped the external bleeding but she's still losing blood inside. She may-she may have ruptured her spleen. I'm gonna need your permission to operate. How complicated is the operation? Well, it might take a few hours. We wanna make sure we've got all the bleeding stopped. - How are her vital signs? - 'Steady.' Mary Ellen's strong and she's a fighter. I believe she'll come through this with flying colors. Thank you, doctor. Uh, what does this mean? Taking out her spleen. Well, she can live a normal life without it, but uh.. ...she may be more prone to infections. Has anybody talked to Johnny? No, nobody said anything. No use saying anything no more. Yeah. Hi, honey. Hi. Did you have fun drawing? Uh-huh. There's so much to draw in the mountain. - Wanna see what I've done? - Oh, yeah. Oh, these look really good. Hey, look at you. - What's this for? - That offensive lipstick. That lipstick is a little too much. You two are so provincial. Everyone wears dresses like this at school. - Everyone wears makeup. - Not my daughter. 'You were sent to a finishing school' 'to learn to be a lady.' And a lady does not...paint her face and bare her shoulders. If we were to put these pictures in the front window, I bet somebody would buy them. You mean it? Mr. Godsey, you cannot peddle your daughter's masterpieces amidst the cayle and cucumbers. But those are only sketches of local scenes. Aimee, one day your paintings will hang in museums. 'As of now, your talent is still very easily influenced.' 'And it must not be channeled into crass commercial areas.' Now, in the fall you will be sent to a very fine woman's college in New England. In New England. Well, we cannot allow Aimee's talent to languish because of a lack of a good local school. My art professor Dana thinks you can learn about art anywhere. You call...your teacher by his first name? Dana is more than a teacher. I'm his favorite student. His protege. If I have any talent at all, it's because he's inspired me. And how did he do that, pray tell. We'd spend long hours in front of the fire, talking about art. I think it is high time that you were sent to a different school. I'd rather stay on Waltons Mountain and paint here. Aimee, this summer you will sketch the local scene. Then you will be sent to college. Now, I must see about the dinner. You know, you're the first artist in the Godsey family. And I think that's pretty special. I'm not really an artist. At least not yet. Well, could I see that picture you're working on now? Oh, I don't let anybody see my rough sketches. It upsets my artistic flow. Well, I...guess I'd better go help your mother with dinner. Don't you think they could send a nurse out and give us a report or something? - Hello. - How is she? - Doing fine. - Did you stop the bleeding? Uh, that's why the surgery took so long. We, uh...we found some minor bleeding apart from the spleen and had to stop that too. - You did take out the spleen. - 'Yes.' She'll have to stay in the hospital about two weeks and then spend the next four weeks taking it easy. Can we see her now? Just long enough to say hello then let her rest. Why don't you have a moment with her alone? - I'll be there in a minute. - Thank you, John. [soft orchestra music] - Hey. - Jonesy. You better believe it. I'm sorry. No. No, don't apologize. Doctor says you're gonna be just fine. What happened? You've been in surgery. They removed your spleen. I can't imagine you or I will miss it very much. The deer. A what? The deer on the road. Did I hit it? Oh. So, that's what happened. [exhales] Oh, what an awful honeymoon. No. No, you're alright and we're together. I'll settle for that. [knock on the door] - Hi, honey. - Daddy. I'm so glad you're here. I wouldn't be anywhere else. [Drew] 'Hey, Elizabeth. Wait up.' Drew, I wasn't expecting to see you. I figured you still walked from school the same way. Nothing ever changes. How about you let me carry your books? Oh, sure. Here. Something I don't wanna change. Well, when you start calling I'll carry them every day? Looking forward to that. You know, you're a pretty good letter writer but I'd still-- - Yoo-hoo, Elizabeth, Drew. - Hello, Aimee. How you doing? Hi, Aimee. I'm on my way over to Maude Gormley's. Her Irish Setter just had a litter of pups and I'm dying to see 'em. Wanna come along? Yeah, maybe I'll even take one. It'd be pretty nice having a pup at college. - You wanna go, Elizabeth? - I can't. I have to get ahead on my essay. But you two go on. Elizabeth, I promised I'll take your books home for you. Don't worry about it. You just go ahead. If you insist. I'll take good care of Drew for you, Elizabeth. Deliver him home, all in one piece. Well, thank you. We'll both get there a lot faster if I drive. - How are we gonna do that? - Just hang on. I'll show you. - I'll see you later, Elizabeth. - What! - Bye-bye. - Be careful! [laughing] Hi, sweetheart. Well, mother, what do you think? It's lovely, but won't it be cramped when the baby comes? I'm hoping to add a room by then, Mrs. Norris. Oh, hello, Ben. I can see you're way ahead of me. But you mustn't go on calling me Mrs. Norris. How about Bernadine? - Bernadine. - Good. Cindy, you and I must go shopping soon. You like that? Of course, I just don't wanna take up too much of your time. Oh, no. Since my husband got promoted, he travels a great deal. I'd love to spend the time with you. Well, then, we'll just have to have you come visit more often. [Bernadine] 'And we can go baby shopping.' We already have everything we need for the baby. Yes, mother. Come and see. - Isn't it cute? - Oh. It's been in the family for generations. - My mom added the lace. - Oh! It's lovely! But don't you think it'd be nice if your children had some new things from Cindy's side of the family as well? If you like. Cindy, you and I will go to Charlottesville and have ourselves a shopping spree. Charlie, come on, pal. We're gonna be late. - How's Mary Ellen doing? - She's coming along just fine. Won't be too long before I bring her home. That's good. You two off to visit her? No, I'll go later today. They're very strict on visiting hours. They won't let Johnnie see her and they've rationed my visits. Then why you all dressed up? We do look unusually dashing and debonair today, don't we? We are going to have our photograph taken. C-H-E-E-S-E. [both] Cheese! What do you think? We've been practicing that all morning. It's gorgeous. Why are you gonna have a photo taken, if Mary can't be in it? It wouldn't be a surprise for Mother's Day, would it? That is a super present idea. Come on, pal. You wanna come with us to Rockfish? Ah, wish I could, but I gotta work my school essay. Oh, yes. I remember those. I always got a B+. This is going to be an A paper. Oh, you better get back to work. Come on, John. Can I have a piggy-back ride? Please. Alright, you know I'm a soft touch, don't you? Come on, partner. Let's go. - Bye, Elizabeth. - Bye. Good morning, Mary Ellen. - How do you feel? - Restless. And I'm not thrilled with my scarf. Hmm, what's wrong with it? For one thing, it's longer than I expected. Did you go exploring after you took out my spleen? Mary Ellen, now that you are stronger I think you should know that we had to patch you up in more than one place. But I'm okay now. Well, not entirely. You see. During the surgery, we found bleeding in the pelvic region. We discovered a tear in your uterus. How can that be? The uterus is so protected. Not against car accidents and puncture wounds. You were very lucky the bladder or left kidney wasn't damaged. - What did you do? - We sewed up the tear. But as a medical student you must recognize the consequences. 'And if you become pregnant, there is considerable risk' 'that as the baby grew, the seam would not expand' 'with the rest of the wound and it could rupture.' Then I don't know if the baby or you could be saved. 'It was real bad luck.' I am sorry. Isn't there a slight possibility that I could have a full-term pregnancy. That the stitches would hold? I can't imagine you or your husband would wanna take that risk. Does Jonesy know? No. I thought you'd want to find your own way to break the news. [sniffles] He so wanted a large family. Lots of...brothers and sisters for John-Curtis. Mary Ellen, is there anything I can do for you? [piano music] John-Curtis, come on, stop it. Let me brush your hair. Don't you wanna look handsome for your mamma? Yes, you do. [car honking] That's them. So John-Curtis misses his mama. ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For she's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ That nobody can deny ♪ [applause] I wasn't expecting a welcoming committee. Well, you got one. Daddy, Ben and Paul would've been here but they are at the lumbering camp. Welcome home! How do you feel? Sit down, sit down, make yourself at home. I baked some of mama's apple sauce cake now that your finally here, we can cut it. Oh, just a tiny piece for me. I think after a couple of weeks of hospital food you'd be ready for some home cookin'. Hospital food's the one thing that I'm not looking forward to, at this next baby. As long as you have a healthy baby I don't see what there is to complain about. John-Curtis, why don't you and I spend some time together? - Okay? - Okay. I think that Mary Ellen's a little bit tired from the drive. 'It'll do her good to spend some time alone with...John-Curtis.' And I think I will have her piece of apple sauce cake. [indistinct chattering] - There is one. - I'm starving. I think we just bought out Hearson's Baby Department. Why is it all baby clothes are pink, blue or yellow when what we're looking for is something in peach or green. Everything is beautiful, mother. I can't wait to show Ben. Now, there's one more shop right around the corner that we must look at. Can we stop for a few minutes, I'm gettin' little tired? Aw, of course. How about a cup of tea? That sounds great. Little place right here, I think. Ben seems as excited about this baby as you are. Ben's a terrific father. I wonder that he doesn't worry about paying the bills. Supporting a family is no easy task. I know. Ben's worked very hard at the mill. This is the first time in a long time we don't have to worry about money. Didn't you say Ben wanted to go to college? Well, right after the war, he thought about getting an engineering degree, but his father needed him. And you know, it's just as well I don't think we could've made it even with the GI Bill. I'd like to help. I could pay the bills while Ben went to school. Thank you, mother. But I don't think Ben's even thought about going back to school. He's so involved in the mill. It would be a wonderful opportunity for him why, he could make something of himself. Get you and the children a home of your own outside Washington or Charlottesville. We have a good life, mother. And I don't think Ben would even consider taking your money. Cindy, you've depended so much on his parents the last few years. Why not depend on yours? I don't know. [groans] What is it, dear? But-but you're not due for weeks. Mother, I think you better get me to the hospital [intense music] Have some soup. Ah, maybe later. - Hi, Elizabeth. - Hi, Gini. - Soup? - No, I don't want soup yet. Where'd you find that typewriter? - It's one of John-Boy's. - Why are you playing with it? I'm not playing with it. I'm writing. - Well, it's time to stop. - I gotta finish the essay. Elizabeth, we got a date to go fishing today. - I have to take care of Gini. - 'She can come with us.' 'Drew, I don't wanna break my train of thought.' We can go fishing anytime. I can't believe I'm being stood up for a stupid essay. Writing about what I wanna do with my life is not stupid. Yeah, what about, want to be my girlfriend. Drew. Drew. [water gushing] [birds chirping] You spoil me too much. I'm not an invalid. That's why I think you should take the rest of the day off. We can go up the mountain. Take a picnic supper. Watch the sunset. And...make a wish on the first star. I'm too far behind in my class work already. I-I happened to have one more brilliant idea. I'll take the phonograph up to our bedroom and we can rendezvous there after supper for a little... cheek to cheek dancing. Just you and me alone, together. With the music and the moonlight. [giggling] You really are trying to distract me. Pathology is hard enough as it is. I just wanna sweep you off your feet for a little while. Can it wait? Alright. - Elizabeth? - No. Oh, Aimee. I should've known it wasn't Elizabeth. It's not her perfume. Oh, it's called Lamoure Duprente. Do you like it? Well, sure, but it's a little faint. It would be vulgar to put on too much perfume in the middle of the afternoon. So, I only put a little here, behind my ears. - Wanna smell it? - Oh, yeah, that's nice. You know, I bought Elizabeth some rose water one time. But she only wears it on special occasions. Now, I think Elizabeth's wrong. A woman should wear perfume everyday. Well, she never knows whom she might bump into. And then it could become a special occasion. Yeah, I know what you mean. You know sometimes, I'll be in gym class, right and I'm.. ...I get through and I won't have time to shower. Well, there, I'll be smelling like a dirty old sweat sock and sure enough I run into some girl I know. Don't go on, please. Am I embarrassing you talkin' about sweat socks? I'm sorry. We can find other areas for conversation. - Where's Elizabeth? - She's home, doin' her essay. How dreary. Yeah, for me too, we're supposed to have a date today. I was just doing some drawings, mostly landscapes. Wanna see? Well, yeah. I'd sure like to practice sketching the male physique. If you haven't made any new plans well...maybe I can draw you. No, Aimee, I'm sorry, but I'm no model. Oh, but you are! You are so like Michelangelo's David. Broad shoulders and a firm torso virile stance. 'It would be such good training for me.' Well, what I go to do? Try standing over there, under the tree. Relax your arms. I may need several sessions to capture the real you. 'Now, stand still.' Good. [chuckles] [sawing] [phone rings] Ben, get that. Okay, daddy. Hello. Hey, Paul. I can't hear you. Yeah, this is Ben. When? Tell Cindy I'm on my way. Thank you. Bye-bye. - What happened? - Cindy's gone into labor. - It's a little early. - It's much too early. - Where is she? - Charlottesville Hospital. - I've gotta go. I'm worried. - I'll go with you. Come on. Okay, daddy. Tell everyone what's happened, okay? - Yeah, I will. Good luck. - Bye-bye. - Cindy! - Ben, I'm glad you made it. You sure it's not false labor? The baby and I are way past that. - I love you. - Oh, I love you too. [doctor] We have to go now. My mother's in the waiting room. Keep her company, will you? I will. I hate waiting. - Hopin' for a boy or girl? - A girl. We've already got Gini. Yeah, but she needs a little sister. I always wanted one. How about twins? One of each. I don't think there are any twins in the Walton family. I think there have been some in my family so it's possible Mary Ellen and I could have one. - Where is Mary Ellen? - Studying. What else? Here, play these. I'm gonna try to pry her away from her books for a while. How can you calmly study when you're just about to become an aunt again? Haven't you heard, "Patience is a virtue?" [chuckles] Well, I can't wait to have a baby around here. What's that? Aah! You're curious, ah? I saw this in a Charlottesville store and it screamed out to me "Buy me for Mary Ellen." So I did and.. ...well, I was gonna give it to you for Mother's Day. 'But, what the heck?' Well, open it. It's beautiful. - You wanna try it on? - Now? It's so sheer. I'll bet you'll be able to see my scar through it. Mary Ellen, do-do you honestly believe that your scar bothers me? I-I'm relieved that it will mean an end to any desires you may have for a career as a belly dancer. [both laughing] Come here, beautiful. [chuckles] What's so funny? No, I was.. Nothing. I was just thinking of something I was telling others. It is entirely possible that we could someday have twins. [dramatic music] Getting it wrinkled. We can't afford this kind of luxury. Especially, after the hospital bills. - You'll have to take it back. - I will not! Look, I-I will doctor animals from here to South Carolina. I will work overtime but I'm not gonna take that back, damn it! Please don't swear. Mary.. Mary Ellen...Mary Ellen. Honey. We had one wonderful night on our honeymoon. And we went through the hell of the accident and now you've been home recuperating for more than a month. There is no reason that we cannot make love. Unless, you don't want to. Jonesy, it's just too soon. I think we should wait a few more-- Well, then your medical opinion differs from the doctors. What.. Why do you keep pulling away from me? - What have I done? - You're rushing me. Well, I guess the honeymoon is really over. [sighs] Don't be hurt. I love you. That's reassuring. I'm gonna say goodnight to John-Curtis. [door closes] You sure have spent a lot of time here lately. But do either of you have a cigarette? - No. I'm sorry. - I don't smoke. Just as well, I have been through nearly a whole pack since breakfast. It's a terrible habit. Daddy, were any of us premature babies? Yeah, John-Boy. I was away at the war when he was born. I missed all the excitement. Like I did with Gini. She was early but not like this. Oh, dear! I think I better go find some cigarettes. Do either of you want anything? No. Thank you. I get along with your mother-in-law, son. I'm not crazy about her. We get along fine. Phew! Daddy, how could you stand all this waiting for so many children? Grandpa used to sit with me and tell me a bunch of stories to pass the time. He hoped it would take my mind off Liv. It never did. I sure wish grandpa could have seen Gini. At least would've known about her. I think he knows. Mr. Walton? - Yes? - Yes? Congratulations! You have a little boy. Boy! You hear that, daddy? - How's Cindy? - She's eager to see you. I'll be back to get you in a few minutes. A daughter and now a son. That's a good feeling. It sure is, son. It sure is. - Congratulations! A son! - Thank you. Ha ha ha. Meredith Town Construction. No. You sure? I'm positive. Was it important? Oh, sure is. They should have sent the first payment by now. Sounds like that job is running you ragged. Phew! It sure is. Here are the things Mary Ellen ordered. Well, thank you, Corabeth. How is the latest addition to the family? To tell you the truth, I've been so busy I haven't seen him since the night he was born. But that night, he was real small and healthy. - Pick him a name yet? - Named him after Ben. And Cindy's adoptive father. Charles Benjamin Walton. Charles Benjamin. That has a melodic yet stately ring. Yeah. Me and Ben are already calling him Charlie. Charlie? Charlie. [door closes] Charlie. [Ben] Charlie is so tiny. Shouldn't he be growing a little faster? Charles Benjamin is like any other premature baby. Dr. Roper says it just takes longer for him to grow. [Ben] He's so cute. Hello! Hello! Oh, mother, they're beautiful. I thought you'd like them. Oh, Ben, may I? Of course. Oh! [Ben chuckles] Oh, hello, Charlie. It's your nanna. [all laugh] Have you been a good boy? Oh, he's been very well behaved. It's his mother who's starting to feel a little cranky. What's wrong? I just want to go home and see Gini. I'll take you home in a day or two. But Dr. Roper said that Charlie has to stay on another week. - Something wrong? - No. No. He's so tiny, they want to watch him for a little longer. Well, then, we'll just drive out here every day. [Cindy] 'But you have so much work to do.' [Ben] 'Daddy and Paul can cover for me at the mill.' I can always work at night and just get up early. May I make a suggestion? 'I already have a room at the Jefferson Hotel.' I'd love to have Cindy stay with me. And it's within walking distance of the hospital. That would be perfect. Then I could see Charlie whenever I wanted and you could drive over when you had the time. It seems like a lovely solution. Ben? Is it alright? Well, I can't think of any better ideas. [Ben] 'Thanks, Bernadine.' Watch this. [screams] You did that on purpose. Didn't you? Didn't you? - Didn't you? Didn't you? - No, no, no, no, no. Let's build another one. Okay. I think we need some more small blocks. Why don't you go up to your room and see if you can find any? - Hi, honey. - 'Hi, daddy.' Stopped over at Ike's and got the groceries. Well, thank you. What a mess. It's your grandson's fault. We were building a tower and he sabotaged it. Do you wanna help us build another? I haven't got time. I got to get over to Charlottesville and pick up some tools. I'm gonna see Cindy and the baby. Do you wanna go? I think I better stay with John-Curtis. Erin's lookin' after Gini. She could look after John-Curtis as well. No, thanks. 'Honey, that baby was born a week ago.' Everyone in the family has been to see him but you. Ben and Cindy might begin to wonder. They'll get over it. Come on. Now, you don't wanna hurt their feelings. Just don't ask me to go and coo over their baby. I don't think I can manage it yet. Mary Ellen, that didn't sound like you. What's going on? I'm envious. Oh, come on now, Mary Ellen. Tell me. What's-what's wrong? I don't think Jonesy and I will ever have children. Whatever gave you that idea? The accident. There was more damage than they thought at first. If I would become pregnant I could be risking my life and the baby's. Is the doctor sure of this? I'm sure. Honey, can't they do something? Isn't there an operation? No. Oh, Mary Ellen. Honey, honey, honey. Honey, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You know a while back your momma wanted to have another baby. She had to face the same thing. I wish momma were here now. So do I. [sobbing] Jonesy and I always planned to have a large family. He seems to be taking it pretty well. He doesn't know. I haven't had the courage to tell him. Mary Ellen, do you think that's fair to him? Is it fair to him that he's married to a woman that can't give him the children he wants? Oh, daddy, I'm so frightened. I'm afraid I'm gonna lose him. Knowing that he'll stay and pity me. Honey, you just got to talk it over with him. If only I could talk to momma. I need to see her so much. Hm. Then, maybe you should go see her then. But before you go, you got to promise. You're gonna tell your husband about this. [sighing] I promise. When are Ike and Corabeth getting back? They just left. Elizabeth, are you a scaredy-cat? I just think if they saw you like this, they'd be surprised. It's how I looked all the time at school. How could you get away with it? It's called having allure. You take what nature's given you and enhance it a bit. I think it's more than a bit. Especially, for Waltons Mountain. Well, one never knows who could drop by. Who would you like to drop by? Hm, Dana, my art professor. Here, you sit down and I'll see what I can enhance. First. - Mascara. - Be careful. Trust me. Maybe, you shouldn't do my eyes. You wanna have bedroom eyes or not? Well, maybe not bedroom eyes. Of course. If you think you can't handle your own sexual allure. I can handle it. Hello? Aimee? Elizabeth? Am I supposed to be expecting you? I saw your dad. He said you finished your essay. I thought you'd like to celebrate with ice cream soda. Oh, that's nice. Why don't you come along, Aimee? - I have to watch the store. - Oh, that's too bad. I know. I can have Jim-Bob keep an eye on the place. He's awfully busy. Oh, he won't mind. Come on, let's go. Jim-Bob! 'Be a darling a
