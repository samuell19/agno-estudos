(car horns blaring) (sirens wailing) (helicopter engine buzzing) (suspenseful music) (wind whistling) (wheels creaking) (grunting) (chisels clanging) (grunting) - [Loudspeaker] Prisoner Savage, report to the warden. (grunting) - Move it! (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) - You are on Titan Maximum Security Prison Colony, Sigma Sector, Delta Quadrant. Colony population 1,226. (wheels creaking) (grunting) (rocks thudding) Main colony industry, magnesium mining. (loud rumbling) (yelling) (metal groaning) (loud thudding) Colony managed by Interstellar Correctional Services Corporation. - Nicola Alexandra Savage a.k.a. Nikki Savage a.k.a. Alexandra Nichols a.k.a. Nikki Knight. (grunting) Rogue United Stellar Marshalls Service. Arrested 2nd of the 2nd '66 while on undercover assignment. (grunting) Crime, murder of a law enforcement officer, unlawful flight, escaping confinement, theft of government services. (sighing) Sentence, death. Commuted to life at hard labor. Since incarceration, subject has been involved in six violent encounters, one of which resulted in the death of another prisoner. Subject is presumed to be the cause of the other prisoner's death but no witnesses came forward. Subject is to be presumed extremely dangerous. I like that. (laughing) - Hey, Nikki! - Where they taking you, Nikki? - Take me with you! - Leave her alone! - You show them, Nikki! - Show them! - Where you going? - [Prisoner] Kick the fat one, Nikki! - Leave her alone! - Where are you taking her? - Go, Nikki! - Get them, Nikki, come on! - Where are you going? - Good luck, Nikki! - So, who the hell are you? (gate clanging) - My name is Max. I'm your fairy godmother. - Where's your wand? - Right here. (keys tapping) (computer beeping) It can do almost anything. - Can it get me out of here? - If you play your cards right. - I don't have any cards left, pal. - The name is Max. - Yeah, I still don't have any cards left. - You can always bluff. - Why don't you stop being so obscure and get to the point. I've got a sentence to serve and I don't like playing games. - You're right, Nikki, you don't have any cards. What's more, you murdered a cop. - A dirty cop and it was a set up from the start. Or does that little magic wand of yours tell you that side of the story? - I know a lot of things, Nikki. Probably more than you know. You were the best undercover agent the Service ever had. You've got guts and brains and intuition and you don't know when to quit. You've been here almost two years and you're still alive. For Titan, that's saying something. - What are you selling, Max? - Who says I'm selling anything? - You wouldn't be in this godforsaken place if you didn't want something from me. What? - We need your help. - (laughs) And who's we? - You don't need to know. - What do I get out of the deal exactly? - You pull this off, we shave five years off your sentence. - (laughs) Five years. Make it 10 and get me out of the mines. No more hard labor. - Eight. - Deal. - Take a seat. - (giggles) In this thing? - [Max] Best seat in the house. - So what is this, some kind of virtual reality gear? - [Max] Better. - I must be crazy. - [Max] That is one of the reasons you were chosen for this mission. - What mission? - This one. (keys tapping) (computer beeping) (suspenseful music) (low rumbling) United Space Services Corporation Research Vessel Unitransco. Crew, 136. Scientific staff, 87. (boots thudding) - This way. - Cover me. - Right. - [Max] Security staff, nine. Unitransco mission, research and long-term study of temporal transference of raw materials interdimensionally. (beeping) (breathing apparatus hissing) (door hissing) Keep watching. 86 days ago, a team of scientists including Dr. Janice Dane conducted an experimental mission to an unknown quadrant in the Ganex System. - Time travel? - Go fast enough, time and distance become the same thing. (electrical whooshing) (cosmic thudding) Keep watching. Initially, the mission progressed successfully. But there were a number of problems. (scientists chattering) (static buzzing) - [Scientist] Initializing. - [Max] Eventually, most of the problems were solved. (static buzzing) (distant yelling) But, by that time, the mission team had completely disappeared. In the end, only one member of the team was recovered. (whooshing) Dr. Dane. Since the reappearance of Dr. Dane, there has been no communication with the Unitransco or with anyone aboard her. (metal clanging) (soldiers yelling) (loud thudding) Long-range sensors indicate there is still human life aboard the Unitransco. (static buzzing) (pained yelling) (monstrous hissing) Sensors also indicate the presence of another, unidentified, life form. (monstrous squealing) (guns firing) - [Soldier] Get up, shoot, come on! (guns firing) - [Nikki] Unidentified life form? - We think something came back with Dr. Dane. (guns firing) - [Nikki] Something? (monstrous squealing) (monstrous grunting) - We're not sure what it is. All we know for sure is that Dr. Dane and the Unitransco have not checked in with company headquarters for the last three weeks. The company is worried. The Unitransco and the work they're doing on her is worth billions. - So what am I supposed to do about it? - You used to be a Marshall, you brought in the bad guys, we want you to do it again. There's a supply drone on its way to the Unitransco now. Everything you'll need is on board. They're expecting a new security officer named Smith. That's you. - What happens if I get into trouble? Do I have any back-up? What's that? - Your back-up. (clicking) (grunting) That was a nanochip I just injected. In a few seconds from now, it'll find a nice spot in your cerebral cortex and set up shop. It receives, transmits, records and calls for help. - Gee, what I always wanted. So, when do I get to leave? - Well, what about now? - I'll have to consult my appointment book. Right now is fine. Anything's better than being in those mines. Exactly how am I supposed to get on the supply drone? - Well, that's the easy part. (beeping) (thudding) (whirring) (heroic music) Good luck. You'll need it. (loud clanging) (adventurous music) - [Computer] Docking sequence initiated. Three minutes to insertion. - Back in the saddle again. - [Max] Nikki, you're okay? - Max? Where the hell are you? - [Max] Inside your head. The nanochip, remember? - Oh yeah. - [Max] Just one last thing before you dock, the company isn't taking any chances on releasing some kind of alien life form into the general population. You've got 48 hours to find out just what the hell is going on. - And if I don't? - [Max] The company launches a missile attack and you get blown away along with everyone else on board Unitransco. (loud rumbling) (whooshing) (loud rumbling) (hissing) (thudding) - [Computer] Docking completed. (suspenseful music) (beeping) (door hissing) Welcome to United Space Services Research Vessel Unitransco. Marshall Smith, Dr. Dane is waiting for you in laboratory seven. Please follow the left hand corridor until you reach the elevator. Take the elevator to deck 19. - Anything I should know about myself? - [Max] Ask the chip. - (laughs) How the hell am I supposed to do that? - [Max] Think the question. If the answer's in the databank, you'll get an answer. (whirring) - Okay. Who is Marshall Smith? - [Nanochip] Searching databanks. (nanochip beeping) Last assignment, prisoner transport services. Marshall Smith is a non-monogamous tantric. - Hold it, what's a non-monogamous tantric? - [Nanochip] Searching databanks. (nanochip beeping) (monstrous breathing) N.M.T. was a small religious order established on Terra Nine 30 years ago. Practitioners of N.M.T. believe that all relationships, male or female, should be sexualized. - Great, I'm a space slut. (monstrous hissing) Now he tells me. (beeping) (mysterious music) - I didn't hurt you too much, did I? - Just a little bit. (soft footsteps tapping) - He'll make it better. (moaning) (keys tapping) (beeping) (door hissing) (moaning) (beeping) You're the new Marshall. - Yes, ma'am, Janet Louise Smith, I've-- (moaning) I've been assigned to your installation. - This doesn't bother you, does it? The file does say that you're a tantric, is that right? - So they say. And no, ma'am, it doesn't bother me. I've just been admiring their technique. - A Marshall with a sense of humor. You are a refreshing change. (moaning) - So, what happened to the other Marshall? - An unfortunate accident. - [Nanochip] John Hamilton, 37-years-old, cause of death listed as accidental. - What type of accident? - He took a breath where he shouldn't have. - [Nanochip] According to the log, he suffered total instantaneous decompression in a malfunctioning airlock. - Lovely. - They are, aren't they? (moaning) (tense music) Yes! - [Nikki] Ma'am? - You're still here. - Ma'am, I was wondering something. - Yes? - I thought this was a scientific research ship. - There's more than one kind of science, Marshall, and there's more than one kind of research. - Yes, I guess that's true. - This key will give you unrestricted access to the ship except for deck one, which is off limits to everyone but me. - Okay. - You'll excuse me, but I have a lot of work to do. Your quarters are on deck four. The computer will show you the way. (moaning) (moaning) (whooshing) (whooshing) (beeping) (door hissing) - I thought these were my quarters. - You're Marshall Smith. - That's right. Who are you? - I'm Joe, Joe Pike. Dr. Dane's associate. I was just tidying up, trying to make you feel at home. - Thanks. - Well, I guess I'll be going, let you get settled in. - Sure. - I'll see you later. (beeping) (door hissing) - Sure. (Nikki sighing) I wonder what type of research goes on here. - [Nanochip] Searching databanks. Verbal or visual representation? (mysterious music) - Both. - [Nanochip] For the last several years, the Unitransco has been doing temporal experiments, testing the feasibility of large-volume material transfer across extremely large distances. (computer beeping) (breathing apparatus hissing) (computer beeping) (machinery revving) - [Nikki] How long has Dr. Dane been conducting research into human sexual behavior? (moaning) - [Nanochip] Searching databanks. There is no record of any such research being conducted aboard the Unitransco. - Interesting. (low rumbling) (suspenseful music) (metal clanging) Where's computer station 26? - [Nanochip] Would you like a verbal or visual representation? We have both options available. - Plain directions would be good. - [Nanochip] As you like. Left hand corridor, three levels down. (monstrous wet hissing) (thudding) (monstrous wet hissing) (thudding) (monstrous wet hissing) (thudding) - [Guard] This is a restricted area. - Hi, I'm the new Marshall. - This is a restricted area. - Marshall as in boss. Your boss. Look, your devotion is noted, but right now I need you to get out of my way, okay? - [Guard] This is a restricted area. - Well, then I guess you're gonna have to arrest me. (grunting) (mysterious music) (heavy breathing) (Dane sighing) (lock buzzing) (beeping) (door hissing) Video file, Ganex Expedition. - [Computer] Those files have been deleted. - Who deleted them? - [Computer] Dr. Janice Dane. (moaning) - Personnel file, psychological profile of Dr. Janice Dane. (laughing) - [Computer] Those files have been deleted. - Is there any file that horny doctor hasn't deleted? (moaning) - [Computer] 4,222,372 files aboard Unitransco have not been deleted. Please define horny. - Smart ass. Status update, (computer beeps) United Space Service Research Vessel Unitransco. (computer beeping) (moaning) - [Computer] Steady pre-determined course, rotating axially once every 23.4 hours. - Suspend update. Crew status. - [Computer] Crew is in suspended animation in the long-distance pods on deck 27. - [Nikki] How many? - [Computer] 136. - That's almost the entire crew! Who the hell is flying this bucket of bolts? (computer beeping) - [Computer] I have no data on a bucket of bolts which is presently flying. - Okay, who is running the ship if half of the crew is asleep? - [Computer] United Space Services Research Vessel Unitransco is presently on automatic pilot. (beeping) (door hissing) (communicator chirping) - [Guard] Dr. Dane, we found Westwell on level C with a busted head. We think Marshall Smith did it. - I don't care if the idiot's skull is fractured, I want him to find the woman now. I thought I told you to keep an eye on her. Can't you even do a simple job like that? - Well, I can't watch her every single moment of the day. - Well, then I guess I'm just gonna have to do it myself. Oh yeah. (moans) More. (Dane sighing) - Someone has got to know what's going on here. (dramatic music) (whooshing) (sighing) - [Dane Voiceover] There's more than one kind of science, Marshall, and there's more than one kind of research. There's more than one kind of science, Marshall, and there's more than one kind of research. - Locate Katarina White. - [Computer] Katarina White is presently in the ship's infirmary. (mysterious music) (heart rate monitor beeping) - All she did was scratch him. (soft moaning) - [Guard] Hey! - I know, I know, restricted area. (suspenseful music) (footsteps tapping) - Stop. You may leave. - Looks like he had too much of a good thing. - A hidden coronary ailment, bad luck. - Oh, really? What about her? More bad luck? - You might say that. You were in the computer room, why? - Oh, just looking around. - The computer terminals are off-limits except to authorized personnel. - Restricted area, yeah, I know. - The infirmary is a restricted area as well. Unless, of course, your health has taken a sudden turn for the worse. - I feel fine. - You must be tired, though. Looks like you could use some rest. Lack of sleep can be dangerous. What have you got there? - Sorry. - Just a scratch. - Tell that to him. - I want you to find out everything you can about her, no matter what you have to do. - We can't afford to lose another Marshall, Doctor. The company is gonna start to wonder. - Then be discreet. - Anything you say, Doctor. (suspenseful music) - [Nikki] Is anybody there? - [Max] What's up? - [Nikki] I want some answers or I want out. - [Max] We've been picking up a completely alien bacterial presence on board Unitransco. - [Nikki] A bug? - [Max] We don't know. But you're in for the duration, I'm afraid. The good doctor is probably victim zero, the first one to contract the bug. You have to find out if her behavior is irrational or if there's something else going on. - [Nikki] Something else? (heart rate monitor beeping) - [Max] The word invasion springs to mind. (doorbell chiming) - Come in! (beeping) (door hissing) I thought it would be you. - Really? Why is that? - Well, you're Dr. Dane's eyes and ears. I suppose she sent you down here to get some information from me. - No, I came on my own. - What's that, suddenly overwhelmed with affection? - Well, I do find you attractive. And you're a tantric. And I thought you might have got the message, too. We're being watched. - Yeah, I got the message. Joe, exactly whose side are you on? - You've got to help me get off this ship. How about some music? (gentle romantic music) That's better. - Joe, you have until my very last button until I kick your teeth in. What the hell's going on here? - I'm supposed to seduce you and get everything you know and, if I don't, she's gonna kill me. (sighing) (heavy breathing) - He will be next. I hope you like him. (moaning) (moaning) There's enough guards on this ship to service her. After all, she is a tantric. (moaning) I like a happy crew. (moans) (heavy breathing) One big happy family. (low rumbling) (mysterious music) (heart rate monitor beeping) - Why aren't you sick? You've been exposed long enough. - You know about the sickness? - Where does the bug come from? - We don't really know, there was a temporal shift when Dr. Dane came back through the chamber. It could have been then, we're not sure. - Max was right. (heart rate monitor beeping) I have to find out more. I need to go back to the infirmary. - She's watching your every move. - Then let's show her some good ones. (heart rate monitor beeping) (suspenseful music) (sighing) (moaning) (heart rate monitor beeping) (suspenseful music) (wet gurgling) (heart rate monitor beeping) (wet gurgling) (heart rate monitor beeping) (wet gurgling) (heart rate monitor beeping) (heart rate monitor rapidly beeping) (gasping) (gasping) (wet gurgling) (bones snapping) (gasping) (yelling) (bones snapping) (alarm beeping) - [Nikki] What the hell? (alarm blaring) - [Computer] Warning. - Security breach. (gasping) (pained yelling) (squelching) (screaming) (monstrous screeching) - [Computer] Warning. (monstrous screeching) - [Computer] Warning, biohazard containment-- (monstrous screeching) (heart rate monitor droning) Warning, warning, warning. (doors thudding) Containment procedures in effect. - Come on! - [Computer] All safety doors will be sealed immediately. All personnel, evacuate from level C. (lock beeping) - I can't get it open, you try! (lock beeping) - She must have changed the security codes. Here comes trouble. - [Dane] What's going on here? - It's not the Marshall's fault, she's just trying to do her job. - Well, why don't you go and do yours? Now, both of you, leave. - Please, let's go. - Not until I find out what's going on behind that door. - What's going on behind that door is none of your concern. - It's okay, I can handle this one on my own. - You think you can handle me, Marshall? - Absolutely. - I have spent half a lifetime on this research, Marshall Smith. The company gave me complete control and authority over this facility. Authority which I am now exercising. - Well, the company thinks you may have gone mad. - (laughs) Whether I'm crazy or not is irrelevant. You are way out of depth, Marshall, not to mention your jurisdiction. - Everything on this ship is my jurisdiction, Dr. Dane. (guns clicking) (tense music) Is that clear? - Crystal clear. - Now tell your goons to put away their weapons! Now! - Do as she says. - Now, two steps back! Now, open the damn door. - Marshall, you may be a fool but you are not a killer. I will not open that door and you will not pull that trigger. - No? Try me. - All right. (laughs) See? I knew you weren't the killing kind. Put the gun away. - That's far enough. - I can get closer if you want. Now, shoot me, if you dare. Marshall, if you go through that door, you're going to ruin an experiment that is vital to my research. I can't let that happen. - You can't stop me. (gun firing) (grunting) - Lock her up. - Come on. - I think I'll hang on to this for a while. (beeping) (door hissing) (Nikki grunting) (grunting) (beeping) (door hissing) (lock beeping) (Nikki grunting) (thudding) (Nikki grunting) (scraping) (beeping) (door hissing) - Joe Pike is headed to Marshall Smith's quarters. (dramatic music) - [Dane] You'll just have to wait. (low rumbling) (beeping) (door hissing) (beeping) (door hissing) - If this is some kind of peace offering from the doctor, I'm not buying. (tray clanging) - Actually, it was a peace offering from me. - You always run from fights? - Usually, I'm not very good at confrontation. - (scoffs) No kidding. What are you doing? - I'm releasing your computer. The doctor wants you to resume your duties immediately. You can scan all security stations from this terminal. (mysterious music) - I see. - She also wants you in her quarters right away. - Oh, does she? Why? - To give you back your weapon. - Okay, but before I go, show me how this works. - [Joe] Well, you've got to enter the main parameters like this. - Oh, I get it. This the right way? (mysterious music) - No, it's not that easy. - What about this? - No, it's impossible. - There's got to be a way. (keys tapping) Now we're getting somewhere. Works for me. Well, I guess I should be going. Any idea where the good doctor is? - I think she's entertaining. (door hissing) (laughing) - Sorry, hope I'm not interrupting. - No. Actually, I was hoping that you would come. I'm sorry about yesterday. Although, I would prefer that you not aim it in my direction. - You trust me with this? - I've read your file, you're eminently trustworthy and it's good to know who your enemies are, as well as your potential friends. Friendship does have its benefits, especially for a tantric like you. It's my understanding that tantrics value friendship very highly, especially close ones. - Depends on who the friendship's with. - I can offer you all sorts of friendships. Any kind you want. Join me and I can give you a life that the company could never provide you. - That's okay. I think I'll pass. I like to make friends on my own. On my own terms. That way I don't wind up getting stabbed in the back. - Stabbing is the least of your worries, Marshall. And being alone can have serious drawbacks. - I can take of myself. - I'm sure you can. But there are lots of dark corners and shadowy places on a ship like this. Places one shouldn't go by themselves without the protection a friend can provide. - [Nikki] That sounds like a threat, Doctor. - No, just a warning. Do we understand each other? - I think so. You want me to mind my own business and stay out of yours, right? - Exactly right. (laughs) (door hissing) (low rumbling) (dramatic music) (monstrous hissing) (suspenseful music) (monstrous hissing) (monstrous hissing) (thudding) (keys tapping) (beeping) (door hissing) (keys tapping) - She's just who she says she is, a Marshall. - And a tantric. (laughs) Both of you performed quite well. - [Joe] Well, I like to throw myself into my work. - [Dane] Does she know anything? - Not yet, but she's suspicious. - Perhaps another session with you will calm her nerves. What about it, Joe? (beeping) - [Nikki] Now what? - [Max] Pay attention to the monitor. That's the alien's signature. The bug. (scraping) - [Nikki] What's it doing? - [Max] It's getting transferred from Dr. Dane to those two women she was with. - She's transferring the bug on purpose? - [Max] She's the queen bee and the other two are the workers. (moaning) Mucus membrane transfer, probably the most effective. (beeping) - Yuck! - [Max] We need to know more. Incubation periods, for one. How they eat, what they eat. - I've got a line on Dane's personal log. - [Max] Good, reel it in. You've only got about 16 hours left. (keys tapping) - Keep your eye on the Marshall. (door hissing) (Dane laughing) (door hissing) (door hissing) - She'll kill me if she finds out about this. - She'll kill both of us. What are we looking at here? - Her log entry from the day she got back. She was in the infirmary. We thought she was unconscious. All her life signs had gone crazy, pulse, respiration, everything. (heart rate monitor beeping) - [Nikki] Who's the guy in the white coat? - [Joe] Dr. Benson. - I've never met him. - You won't, not unless you visit the freezer units. - He's dead? - [Joe] As a doornail. - But she only scratched him. - Well, it was enough to do the job. It took less than 24 hours. - So that's what Dr. Dane was doing in her quarters with those girls. - Yeah. Check this out. - Freeze that. - [Joe] There's the first one. - And there's the second one. - It could have been the third victim of the evening. - [Nikki] So why aren't you infected? - Well, one of the ones Dr. Dane infected tried to pass the virus on to me but I wouldn't let her scratch me. - So what happens, exactly, when you get sick? - I'm not sure, let's find out. Oh, here we go. (heart rate monitor beeping) This is from last night. - [Nikki] That's Katarina! What the hell's happening to her? (yelling) - She's in labor. (yelling) (cracking) (screaming) (monstrous screeching) - Freeze that. What is that thing? - Her son. - Max was right. We can't let them get off this ship. - Who's Max? - (laughs) He's the only friend we've got. (suspenseful music) (monstrous hissing) (door hissing) - Why here? - Well, this is the only safe way I could broadcast this. (beeping) - Well, what now? - I call up Max. Max? - [Max] Right here. - I'm sending you the contents of Dr. Dane's personal log. High speed transmission begins now. - All right, so when do we talk to this Max character? - I just did. - [Joe] What does this Max guy say? - We have to get a tissue sample from Katarina's body. Max says it's the only key. - Key to what? - Getting out of here alive. (suspenseful music) (monstrous hissing) Are you sure this is where they took her body? (monstrous hissing) - There. Oh, dear God! - Her chest has been torn from the inside out. - I could have stopped this! - No. Dr. Dane is responsible for this, not you. It just sucked the life out of her and left. It's loose on the ship and it looks hungry. - What are you saying, it's looking for food? - Looks like it's harvesting DNA. - Why? - That's what we're here to find out. (monstrous hissing) And when I'm finished, I have to deal with Dane. (clanging) She's the primary carrier. Get rid of her, this all ends right here. (monstrous hissing) Stay away from Dane (gentle music) and stay alive. - You coward. (suspenseful music) (monstrous hissing) (monstrous hissing) (creaking) (monstrous hissing) (heavy breathing) - Come on. (lock buzzing) (lock buzzing) (thudding) (grunting) Come on, come on! (lock buzzing) (monstrous screeching) (thudding) (gun firing) (gasping) (thudding) (loud thudding) (monstrous screeching) (gasping) (clanging) (heavy breathing) (gasping) (monstrous hissing) (footsteps thudding) (tense music) (wet squelching) (thudding) (monstrous hissing) (metal groaning) (gun firing) (metal groaning) (monstrous screeching) (monstrous hissing) (monstrous screeching) (gun firing) (monstrous screeching) (gun firing) (monstrous screeching) (monstrous screeching) (monstrous screeching) (monstrous screeching) - Gonna have to find her! Do a sweep of lower levels. (beeping) Try the triple transfer unit. (heavy breathing) (metal groaning) (thudding) (distant monstrous screeching) - Oh, Max. Where are you when I need you? (distant monstrous screeching) (metal groaning) (monstrous hissing) - God, where is she? (monstrous hissing) (metal groaning) He's on you, Nikki, he's on you, run! (monstrous screeching) (monstrous hissing) (gun clicking) - You want a sample? Sample this. (gun firing) (loud banging) (squelching) (grunting) (tense music) (metal groaning) (metal groaning) (footsteps tapping) What are you doing? - Just trying to make you feel more comfortable. You were unconscious. - [Nikki] Well, I'm wide awake now. - [Max] Don't let her touch you. She's trying to give you the bug. - Our friends from the other side are much stronger than we are, much more powerful, and they have so much to offer us. - [Max] If there's any kind of molecular transfer of DNA, you'll die. - When they come here and take over, they will need people like you and me to convince the others that resistance is futile. I assure you, we will be rewarded. - [Max] Get out of there, now. - I'm open to suggestions. - [Max] Try flattery. - I'm willing to be convinced. - A wise move. - But I'm not gonna be convinced tied up like this. - Let me take care of that for you. - That's okay, I can take care of that myself. - Perhaps another time? This evening? - Yeah. Sounds good to me. (door hissing) (metal groaning) (machinery whirring) (monstrous hissing) (tense music) (door hissing) (door hissing) Still don't see why I have to do this. You've gotten all the information that you need. Why don't I just kill Dr. Dane, you come get me, and then you can blow up this rivet collection. - [Max] We have to stop them cold for good with this mutated bug. - You think it will work? - [Max] We've got to send her back. If she can infect her own kind, we have a chance. (metal groaning) (tense music) (thudding) (monstrous hissing) (gun firing) (monstrous screeching) (gun firing) (monstrous screeching) (loud thudding) (cables snapping) (dramatic music) (monstrous screeching) (metal grinding) (electricity crackling) (monstrous screeching) (monstrous screeching) - Come with me, you son of a bitch! (monstrous screeching) (loud banging) (rumbling) (loud banging) - [Max] I thought you should know, the company isn't taking any chances on releasing some kind of alien life form into the general population. You've got to find out just what the hell is going on. - [Nikki] That's my plan. And if I don't? - [Max] The company launches a missile attack and you get blown away along with everyone else on board the Unitransco. - [Nikki] Not 'til I give Dr. Dane her medicine.
