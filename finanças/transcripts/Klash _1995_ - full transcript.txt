- They've just come back. - Thanks, Sarge. Tell me what you think of these. - I pulled every string I had left to get the job and so I needed to get back into gear. A simple job on a quiet island. When I walked off the plane and the warm breeze smacked me in the face, I thought to myself, Stoney, you are one bad motherfucker. You free? And who could complain about coming to Jamaica? I've always wanted to come here since I shot Bob Marley in Madison Square. But I never went anyplace without being paid. My editor had arranged for me to stay on his friend's yacht in lieu of a hotel bill of course. But the man's cool, I'd rather keep the cash. Can you tell me where the Sun Catcher is? - Way over there. - Way over there? Thanks a lot. What? I knew in my heart I wasn't gonna be living in any Donald Trump luxury but this was bullshit. Shit. - Yes, man. I suppose you are Mr. Stone. - Stoney. - Oh, Mr. Stoney. Welcome. - Who are you? - I'm Walker. Walker. the boatman. So you're the journalist. - Woo. Made it.

Stars too in love, every night too in love. - Where is it? - Suppa out of Youban, just on the corners of Verona. - All right, man. Hey Walker, the fish is good. I caught a cab over to the dance Walker talked about. I didn't get out, I had the driver cruise around for awhile checking out the night. I love the night. Hey hey wait, pull over, pull over. - Yo. - What are you doing, man? - Taking some pictures. Hey wait wait wait, don't touch the camera man. Wait, don't touch the camera man.

Every man she came across, she fucked up. She was something else. - I was right, it will be receipts plus a fat payroll but the real money is the extra we're washing. - Yo. - Respect, man. - We're making one stop. Get up, you're dead. She got nothin' and you would take that away? No respect. Get him and hurry. I have more important things to do. You'll now clean our people place by cleaning the yard every week. - Hey Walker, what you tearing up? - A piece of the boat, man. - Sounds more like you demolishing the boat. - Tell I something, what you know about boat, huh? - I had decided to ignore Blossom. She knew I couldn't do that. Yo, gimme a draw of that. - Thought you gave up smoking, man. - Yo, I just picked it up again. Just taking the edge off. - You gonna say jet, my friend. You take care, you hear? - I'll see you later. - You don't say jet. - This is Mutta Baruka on Ire FM, The Cutting Edge once again. Yeah, I'm originally a six string and I know things go on out there, I know things happening so I want the people out there to feel free, you know? We're not limited to one concerning what I say, so anything you wanna say, you know?

Look like something big. - Lose yourself, Spooky. - Me no like it. It don't feel good. - You worry too much. - I just come from prison. You're supposed to worry about the things that would put me back in. - What make you worry? - Look at it this way. Why us? Why us, man?

Oh, check me before you start taking picture. - Don't worry, I know about that stuff. What is this place? - It's a beauty shop. - Wow. - I adore your work. - Only my work? - So you just bounce around the world takin' picture? - When I can bullshit somebody into paying me enough. - We must do what we must do. - Yeah, you know that's right. But I love it though. - Staring that people through that little hole. - I never heard it put that way. I guess you're right. I look through this lens to see what I can find. Lookin' for that shot. Do you know him? - It's a small island. You were telling me about that shot. - Yeah, yeah that shot. You know, the one where everything comes together. Lights, subject, the shadows, the background, everything. All I have to do is snap the shutter and capture magic. - You're too romantic, Stoney. I like that though. - We drove back to Kingston past the burning cane. I was ready. She had me and I had no idea what was next. It's a nice place. - It is a nice bird cage. - I'd been trying to catch this chick for what seemed like half my life. She always switched up on me. Pulling me in, pushing me away. Nah, not this time. - Drink up, Mr. Stoney. - So rude boy, how was it? - She stood there and looked at me just like I was nothing. She played me, I was pissed. Who was double-crossing who, I don't know. Blossom was all up in this shit. - Boom, clot. - Don't you worry yourself, man. You'll be rich soon. - Rich or dead? - We in. We're supposed to create a diversion and shoot up the show, eh? But we gotta get the guns in secured and tight. - The guns are already inside, man. We walk in clean. See that main entrance over there? Downstairs there is where I get my gun. We have this under control, man. We gonna do this thing out tonight. - Yesi. Yesi. - Ladies, we'll be working with lots of money today and there's no room for mistakes. Is that clear? - Yes. - Yes sir. - We've got their guns, man, we don't need this. - This is for you. I'll feel better if you have a little bit more insurance. - It fine, it be okay man. - I'm all ready to run, mister boss. Bye, Mr. Brown. - Bye, Mr. Brown. - Bye and just remember to be on time tomorrow morning. - Oh, I see ya. Spooky. - Don't move. What you got in there, Spooky? - I hope you don't got nothing illegal in there, Spook. - A man can't walk on the road in this country, eh? - You can walk or limp, what do you have in here? - It's my costume for the Klash. You like it, Sarge? - That's nice Spooky, this is, woo, this is nice but what you got for us? - Well, I really don't know much. - We know that already, idiot. - All right, listen Spooky. Spooky, just tell us what you do know. - Well, I think something about to happen at the Klash. - The Klash. - Woo. You know, I might stay here awhile. - You look like you're slippin', man. - Ha ha, I'm slippin' like a motherfucker. - Rude girl mash up your head bad? - Yeah, yeah. She mashed me up bad, man. My one weakness you know, beautiful women. - You see a woman like that is dangerous, ambitious and wicked. - Yeah. Deceptive and deadly and dangerous and selfish and, yeah. - Hey. Something like that looking something, if it's not your life, sugar and cars, then you're gonna spend the rest of your days in prison. Let's go take a swim, man, and clear your head. You can think about it. - I'll pass. Oh man. Woo, this shit is good, this shit is the best. Hmm. Brah, I think I better butt this out before I start seeing God. I should stick to liquor. - I thought you was dry, you make a big thing about being on the wagon. - Shit happens. - So you havin' fun? - Yeah you know, I'm taking advantage of the situation. - Me will take some rum. - What do you want here, Blossom? - Can I get a drink? What you think me come here for? - Only women answer questions with other questions. - Sorry about what happened yesterday, man. Lee think he own me. - Okay rude girl, you're sorry. Now what do you want? - Help me. - Help you, help you do what? It seems to me like you got all the help you could use right about now. - Help me get away, help me get away from Lee. - You're not making any sense, woman. It seems to me like you got it pretty good right now. What's to leave? - You think I like that situation? You think I enjoy being under his control? - You don't look like you're suffering. - I just don't wear my suffering upon my sleeve like some people I know. Me do something about it. - What are you trying to say? - I'm trying to say that I need you, now. - Okay. Keep talking, what's the deal? - Worked up a master deal for Lee, man. Enough money in bag, you know? - Well Lee should be pretty happy. - Him happy, me not so happy. - I noticed Lee doesn't like to share. - Him sure didn't want to share. - This sounds like it could be dangerous. - Oh wake up Stoney, life is dangerous. All you have to do is make sure we have a safe connection to get off this rasclot island. - Well what's in it for me? - Me will split the with you, 50-50. - How much? - A million dolla. US dolla. - You're getting my attention. - Everybody have a dream, Stoney like that great shot you wanna take one day. This one is for me, I want my life back. Me know a guy get me my papers and set me up right for 20 grand and the rest of the money are for me. - You gotta be kidding me, lady. You fuckin' come in here and you try to hustle me with this bullshit scheme. - It's a master plan, it can't fail, Lee trust me. - Lee trusts you? Look what you're doing to him. - Look what him done to me. - The motherfucker branded her. Bastard. - Wicked Stoney, they're so wicked. - Watch this. - Returning to the Grand Caymans with a big bag of money was starting to sound great. Blossom could convince me of anything right about now. - Then? - Then came Klash. - Yeah. Respect. For me and John Rock, some more music inside of Klash. - All right sounds great. But not by myself, get up here and we'll see. - We are the ones now, come here. - Oh my god, look at this, check it out. - Hey. I think we're gonna bring on stage the latest fashions in dancehall. You think you ready for that? Yes. Go ahead. - I could feel it. Something was about to jump off in a big motherfucking way and I knew I was gonna be right in the line of fire. What else is new? - And it's like a lot of Jamaican stuff and I used to get tapes from different sets and I used to, like you know what I'm saying, I used to come and get like the tapes. - Hi, ladies. - Hi. - Fix it well. - Don't worry, it'll be clean. - It's up to you. - I'm a bad man. - No man, this is ridiculous. It's been three days now. I need to get this air conditioner working now. No no no no, you're not hearing me. Not tomorrow, now. - Where the hell have you been, man? This place is like a furnace. Is this the way your company normally conduct their business? - I'll see what I can do, boss. - Christ, you'd believe we're getting it for free. - Yeah, Shandi. - Yo, National Stadium.

And make me look good. - Mr. Brown! - Yo. - The aftermath of the robbery was ugly. Nearly all of Ragga's men had been killed or wounded during the heist. The show went on without missing a beat. - You're late. Where's the money? Why didn't you call me as planned? - I have some questions for you. My men dead. Why? - Something must have gone wrong. - I know something went wrong. You man, you went wrong. You set me up. - Ragga, use your common sense, you have the money. So why you come here, to kill me because your men couldn't do the job? Is there any more money? - Of course there's more. He hid it in order to show how clever he is. - What you playing at? That's all. - He lying. - Do you know where the money's hidden? Well stop the game playing, it's all over now. So, if I did set you up, what the fuck you gonna do about it now? - Bumbaclot. - Ragga trying to pull something and he's a dead man. - Well if him not dead after all that shooting, I don't know. - Don't worry, he's a walking dead man. You know what to do. I'll meet you in an hour. - You want me to take that? - I'll handle the luggage myself. - Boss, I know it's your woman but I don't trust her. - You were right about everything, Ultimate. Nothing but blanks in the guns. Lee double-crossed me, him dead. Remember that alley down by Hope Road? Meet me there and Ultimate, bring the stash and I'll kill him. - Say your word Spooky man. Many people get hurt today and you could've prevent it. - Yo, I'm outta here Spooky. - Moxy, no leave. - Let Moxy go man, Moxy need some call. Just tell what we need to know or else I'm gonna turn him loose on ya. - You know I have no time for this, man. What Lee have to do with this Raas? Me know him have something to do with it. - Give it up, Spooky. - Lee's not the one. Pussy control him. Just like you. - Hey. - It's Blossom, she da one. - What the hell am I doing here?

Look, we don't have a lot of time. This has gotta be enough for the two of us. - It won't be. - So it is all about the money. - No man, it's not just the money, it more than that. - More than that? How much more, what do you want? That's a hell of a lot of money there. We got it fuckin' made, let's not push it. - I must push man, we earned that money. Okay? I lay on my back and sweat for that money, grind and pulled and fucked for that money. Me deserve it, all of it, all the money and for we. - Look, I don't care about the money. I don't want the money. - You think Lee gonna let us get away? - Fuck me. - I know the man. There no way him rest until we dead. So there no way me rest until him dead. - I don't wanna kill anybody. - Don't you worry yourself, me will take care of it. - Yeah goodnight, this is Mutta Baruka again on Cutting Edge on Ire FM. Enough things happened today. - I wanted to call in to say that what you had to tell me is right. Pure Klash going on, all over gunshots. Everybody in one uproar, fighting. - We're close baby, real close, everything criss. - What would you have done if I hadn't come along? - But you did come along. - You get the piece? - With real bullets this time.

Look, look I'm gonna need to get off the island tonight and I want to use the boat. Can we do that? - Just do what you have to do, man. The boatman will be right here. There's a saying you know, craving always choke puppy. Want all, lose all. - You gotta do what you gotta do, right? Tonight, you arrange it. Thanks. Look, I'll be back in two hours max. You just wait for me right here, all right? - The boatman will always be here waiting. - I'll be back. One for the archives. - Yeah man. We must remember this night, remember it well. Almost. - Well, She had me, I was caught up in the mix on a dark road to who knows where. - This Ragga, he must be fuckin' mad. - Him actually hid the money in the cane field. - Keep your eyes out for that son of a bitch Ragga. - Okay, you wait here Stoney, me soon come back. - I don't like this shit. - Where's the money? - There in the box.

Let her go. - This isn't like taking pictures. - Blast off! - Boss, shit. - Shit. Oh shit, what's he doing? Ah shit. - We did it baby, we did it good. - Yeah. - I told you we could do it. - Let's get the hell outta here. - How bad is it? - I'll live, you almost got me killed. - Me love you. You almost did for me but them can't kill us. We're invincible terrors! - Where you going? - Get the rest of the money. - Blossom, what- - Me at least try. - We don't need any more money. - Stoney, I soon come back. Gimme a kiss. Stoney, for the archives. - No! No! - You played me, old sport. So, here I am. - So that's it? - Well I don't know what more I can say. - How you get yourself mixed up in this kinda mess? Well, you're gonna need a good lawyer. You'll probably get off. But in the meantime Mr. Stoney, you know they're gonna make things very uncomfortable for you. - What else is new? I can handle it. - They've just come back. - Thanks, Sarge. Tell me what you think of these. - The picture. - Ja, Rastafari lives. The last eye and the first. The father of the fatherless and the judger of criminals of this God-desolate habitation. It is said unto thy son to see if I have forgotten thee. Ask and I'll give thee the inheritance and thus the father deserts from thy position. So be wise to your fair rulers and judges of this earth and be justified, lest he purges we as being just rot as kindled but a little. A father of the fatherless and a judge of criminals, that is God, the last eye, Rastafari. Ever living, ever feared for, ever sure. Ja. Rastafari. Living God.
