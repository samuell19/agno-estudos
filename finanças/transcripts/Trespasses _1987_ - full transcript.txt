- Things were lookin' rough that winter. We were having to feed more than we could afford, and still we were losing cattle. But, my boy was coming home from school to pitch in with me. And between us, we were gonna hold things together until they took a turn for the better. I started feeling hopeful about it all. Matter of fact, I found myself saying it out loud. Things could be worse. And sure enough. - Hey Johnny! Say fellow, what're you doin' back home? - Couldn't stand bein' away from those cows, I guess. - Sh-yeah. Wouldn't they put anything in that head for you back at school? - I don't think so. - All right man. Say hello to Mr. Ramsey for me, will ya? - I'll do it. Come in and see my dad? - I think maybe I should wait for a better time. - Thanks, baby. I'm sorry. I better go. - You will be back, won't you? - We'll get all this taken care of, and I will be back. I promise. - I love you. - Dad? Dad. - Come on in here, boy. Look behind that chest and see if that bottle of whiskey's still back there. - You never will make much of a drinker, will ya dad? - There hasn't been a lot to celebrate around here for a long time, fella. - How bad is it? - Not so bad we can't work our way out of it. - Well, work didn't seem to stop the cattle from gettin' sick and dyin' last year. - Well, I'm more worried about your Uncle Herschel than I am us, got too much pride to come in with me. He's tryin' to solve his problems with a whiskey bottle. God knows, you sure can't afford to hire anybody to help you work these days with the price of cattle. - Don't you have an agreement with Mr. Klein over at the bank? - Yeah, I do, and August is good for the money too. Boy, he sure has been sick a lot lately. You know, sometimes I think the only thing that keeps him hangin' on. He's afraid this town won't survive without him. - Yeah, who's managing the bank now? - Richard. - Richard? Sharon Rae's husband? - Yeah. - What're they doin' here? I thought she hated this place. - Yeah, she does like the city better, but last time August got real bad, they both came down. - Well, Cathy sends her love Dad, says she'll be down here when semester's out. - When we get this behind us, I want you to get your degree. - Why, so I can be a yuppie? - Yuppie, what the hell's a yuppie? ♪ Too many times ♪ So she fills the world ♪ Where love would hardly shine ♪ ♪ Searchin' for the key to her pride ♪ ♪ She found the love that her mind had long denied ♪ - Excuse me. - Excuse us. - 3.99. ♪ The day when we met ♪ Our hearts set out on the road ♪ ♪ She traveled before - 69 cents. ♪ Where only love knows ♪ If you're searchin' for love, love's what you'll find ♪ - Is there a gas station open in town? - No, can't say as there is.

Go on, you wanna go to Klein's with me in the morning? - Why you goin' over there? - I'd kinda like to hear Richard's ideas on how he thinks a bank oughta operate. - Why don't you just meet him at the bank? - I've got too much work to do. - Uh-huh, Sharon Rae's bein' over at the house wouldn't have nothin' to do with it, huh? - No. - Is that all you're gonna say? - Well I was gonna say that while you were being so nosy that you've ended up standin' in a pile of fresh cow shit. - Remember kid, don't get mad. Get even. - This is where I belong. - That's why I'm so glad you're here. - This is the one, come on. - You sure this isn't too early for Richard? - He'll have to get used to it if he's gonna deal with ranchers. - It's cold in here. - I'll put on the coffee, and get some wood if you'll build a fire. - I don't wanna build a fire, turn up the heat. - I'd like a fire. - The wood'll be wet. - Daddy always keeps it under the shed. - Okay, I'll build a fire, okay? - Don't forget to call your mother today. And we need to let Robin know what time we're coming in tomorrow. And we should have brought her with us, she'd like it here. - She'd hate it here, it's cold, and it's boring in Texas. - Why don't you start the packing? We might not have enough time when we bring daddy home from the hospital. - She is pretty in the morning, isn't she? - You shouldn't stick your nose into other people's business. - Richard! Richard! - Sharon. - Richard, Richard! - You see this, you see this? - Don't kill her kid, she'll be no good. You don't want my want my friend to kill ya, do you, honey? Put it away, kid. - You remember this, huh? - Oh yeah, kid, go ahead, kid. That's it, kid, that's it. - Oh god. - Boy, I hope Sharon Rae's got some coffee ready. - Morning. - Frank! - Let's get outta here, kid! - 10:30 and time now for the mid-morning market report. - Maudie, don't change that. - Yeah Maudie, man with a future's got to get a future's report. Don't you know nothin'. - Sit down and behave, Arnold. - Over 600 pounds were 50 cents to a dollar lower. - Six months later, things were back as normal as they could be. I was handling it, more or less. - More for you, Herschel? - Won't hurt. - Sharon Rae's daddy was on his feet again, back runnin' the bank. - Best go home and clean up, Herschel. You gotta look like a banker to get a loan. - Oh, well he looks like a million dollars. He's all green and wrinkled. - What do you want, Arnold? - Oh give me some eggs and some dead steer. Long as it ain't one of Franklin's steers. I want it dead, not sick and dead. - How's it goin', Arnold? - It ain't, Franklin. - August was fighting to hold his health and the bank together at the same time. Looked like he was losin' ground on both fronts. - Morning. - Hello, sir. - Morning. Morning John Joe. - Morning, August. - August, don't you dare! Now don't you start givin' me trouble too. - Wanna take a ride? - August and I'd been able to deal with everything from droughts to floods. But when it came to someone harming our kids, we didn't seem to be able to talk about it. I guess we looked at it differently. He just wanted it to go away, and I just wanted one more shot at 'em. - How's your girl? She ever comin' home from school? - She's just fixin' too. What'd you have on your mind? - Richard got Sharon Rae a home computer, got it hooked up to the department store. She can shop, never even leave the house. - Things not goin' right for Richard and Sharon Rae? - Oh, they're goin' splendid. Sharon Rae takes to the city, she always has. Richard's a good man, knows his business. Hell, he's been warning me for years, he says, "Worst thing a banker can do to a man "is lend him money he can't pay back." He called me a gut lender. Richard looks at the numbers, credit analysis, does it with a computer. They teach that now. I just know how to do it the way I've always done it. The way I always analyze credit is look into a man's eyes when he talks to me. Hell, that's the way I built that bank, givin' people credit when nobody else would. But, times are different now. I guess my time has passed. - What happened? - I flat let this town down. I tried to get Richard to come down and take it over. He won't do it as long as I'm around. Would you? - What'd that bank examiner say? - Oh hell, I'm all outta compliance. It's close down the bank or turn it over to some Dallas bank for a write-off. They're gonna make me do it, Franklin. And I can't do it. - What? - Stop loaning, call some in, foreclose. You don't look too bad, Franklin, but Herschel does. Franklin, be a friend to Richard. He doesn't understand take some, leave some. Talk to him. - Let's walk some more. Come on August, I need to get you back to town. - Aw, just leave me here, Franklin. - I can't do that. - Breaker nine. - This is Lambert Three, go ahead, breaker. - This is Franklin Ramsey. Call the hospital, tell 'em I'm bringin' August Klein in. Looks like he's goin' into a diabetic coma. - 10-4. - I said no, Franklin, I said no. - Dr. Kerr, come to emergency. Dr. Kerr, come to emergency. - Take him in, tell Dr. Kerr to crack his chest, I'll be in directly. I'm afraid it's too late, Franklin. Nurse Johnson, please come to emergency. - Shit. - Mama, what is that place? - That's where people get baptized. - Oh. ♪ Abide with me ♪ Fast falls the eventide ♪ The darkness deepens - Mama, I gotta go to the bathroom. - Honey, you'll have to wait. ♪ When other helpers fail and comforts flee ♪ - Mommy, who's that man? ♪ Oh, abide with me ♪ Amen - May we bow in prayer please. Our dear heavenly father, we thank you for your servant, August Klein. Watch over him now, and give him his rest. And watch over Sharon Rae and her family. We ask these things in the name of the one who taught us to pray, saying, our father who are in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, they will be done, on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever, amen. - Well you're so welcome. - I'm awfully sorry. I wanted you to have this hat. I hope this is not the wrong time. I hope it's not too hard on you livin' out here. If there's anything I can do, please call me. - Honey, you might wanna pack your stuff tomorrow so you'll have somethin' to play with, but we have to put these up, they're just to look at. - Why, I'm not hurting them. - Well, your grandma took care of these dolls all her life, she wouldn't like to see 'em out on the floor. Honey, hop in and get the Windex, under the sink. - Is that a problem? - Your tuition's never a problem. I'll just sell your calf. - I know it takes more than a calf. - Texas Department of Agriculture in Austin, Texas now playing in the grain market. Today we're slightly higher. - What if ranching doesn't work for you anymore, Daddy? - I haven't lost it yet. - Yeah, but what would you do? - I don't guess there is anything else I really wanna do. 365 and 3/4, up 2 1/4, December wheat, 361, up three. - It's cost me from time to time. But I just can't help myself, I guess. 231, up 5 3/4. December corn, 332 and 3/4, up 5 1/2. September soybeans closed at 766, up 18 1/2. October beans 782, that's up just a quarter. And December beans at 789 and 3/4, up 20 and 1/4. - Sharon Rae, I'm sorry about this, but people kept quiet on account of August. And now he's gone, and you're back. Things aren't gonna be easy for you around here. People are gonna talk and that's just a bur in my saddle, knowing this thing isn't solved. - Don't you think this is a bad time, Sam? - Franklin, aren't you the one who's been on my ass for six months? All right, well I put out an APB for the tri-state area, and I moved it nationwide and we still don't have anything. Hell, to be honest with you, they could be in Mexico or Canada by now. But I want you two to know I'm not givin' up on it. So anything you might remember, could help. - I've told you a dozen times over. - Sharon Rae? - I can't think of anything. - Well maybe your husband might remember something. - No, I told you, he wasn't there. - But he was in the store the night before. - Yes. - So he might be able to tell me something. - Might be able to. - All right, let's take this from the top. You and Richard pull up, and you notice these two hassling Johnny's girlfriend, what else? - What do you say, want in? - No, not at the present. - Morning, everybody. - Mr. Kimbrough. - Morning. - I hear your coffee's the best in town. - Well, that's 'cause it's the only coffee in town. To go? - I guess it was his first day at the bank that Richard got reacquainted with the Gibson boy. - Aren't you Gibby-- - This is John Joe Gibson, Mr. Kimbrough. - That's right. I noticed your charts, they look good. Do you keep a commodities portfolio? - Well, my degree's in finance. - Dr. Laswell needs you back. - You work with Dr. Laswell over at the sale barn? - Yeah, for the present. - Most people didn't think Gibson amounted to much. But we all thought he was harmless. - Uh, there's your man, I think. - Yeah, thanks, keep it. - Thanks. - Right back through here, yeah. Right around here. Office in the back, did you have a good trip down? - It was a great trip. - Yeah, Franklin Ramsey, is my feed ready to pick up yet? Okay. You been to the bank yet? Examiner's in there. She looks every bit as good as she did 20 years ago. - She can't be that old. Count back, old timer. - Yeah, all right, I'll be there directly. - She sure is hangin' on to it. - Now, you wouldn't wanna be plowin' in another man's field, would ya? - Boys, have a little respect. - I don't know what August was thinkin' about. Non-productive for seven years. It's got to be foreclosure. - See Arnold, you oughta be happy. She wears the same little pretties your wife does. - Boys. What'd you have? - I don't know, here's too much. - Don't you dare give me that much. - Too late, it's done now. - I'll get you for that. - Ma'am, Miss Kimbrough! - Arnold, I'll tell your wife on you! - You follow through, that loan deposit register should be back in line in about six months or so, you can start lending again. - That's about the timetable I was looking at. - Mr. Kimbrough, I went out on a limb to keep this bank open, because I thought a man with your credentials would apply the program, hope I'm gratified. - Well, if you face up to the facts. - You got a tough road ahead, Richard. - That's the only kind that interest me anymore. - We all wondered how Richard would fare with the examiner. August seemed to think Richard knew how to handle things. He was modern. - Good luck, Herschel Ramsey. - I appreciate it. - My pleasure. I mean, I'm glad I saw 'em. - Did you buy these for me? We haven't christened this house yet, you know? - I don't feel well. - You know where it is when you do. - Are we ever gonna have another baby? Why haven't I been baptized? - Do you wanna be baptized? - I'd like to go with you, hun, but I've got a board meeting tomorrow, and there's a stock deal I need to jump on. - It's all right, are you worried? - No, I got it under control. I know what they want but they don't know what I want. That's how they can get you, when they know you want something. Here's the traveler's checks and the cash. You sure that's all you need? - I think so. - You sure? I mean we can tie everything else up in that stock deal tomorrow. Reservations? - I didn't make any. - What? - I just wanted to look to see if they're any new places to stay, does that bother you? - Babe, take it easy. - I'll probably stay at the Hilton. - I'll call a reservation. - Don't. - You don't have to stay there but you'll have it. Have a good trip. - It's all right, Joe. - Can I come in? - Maybe you better not. Sharon Rae. It's just that maybe you better not. - Again. ♪ When you're happy and you know it, clap your ♪ Clap, clap. - Yes, has Mrs. Richard Kimbrough checked in yet? Are you sure? She didn't. - Bacon and biscuits? - You don't have to do that, hun. - I know. Daddy. - I'm sorry, honey. - What're you doin'? - Figuring. - Figuring what? - How much money it's gonna take me to operate. You know Herschel's trying to go this thing alone, he's always had that problem. I'm just trying to figure a way to give him a hand through it all. He's not gonna like that much. But maybe he won't needle up about it. - Maudie said there's bad talk about the bank. Herschel wasn't a surprise, but after the way they did the Henards, nobody knows what to expect. - If they feel like loanin' me that money, they will. And if they don't, they won't. A man has to be taken at his word. - Let's go there for the weekend sometime. I found this great place to stay. Oh, the furniture's gonna come sometime tomorrow. - Where did you get it, so Kim can get one just like it. Daddy, you should knock. - Honey, he doesn't need to knock, it's his own room. - Yeah, but-- - Well you need to go to your own room if you're gonna change. - See what Kim taught me? - When'd you see Kim? - She came over. Come and see on the tile. ♪ Because he was her man Good. ♪ He was her man ♪ But he does her wrong - Hello. - Hello? Are you there? - Yeah. - I have a terrible time on the phone. When can I see you again? - Mama, my tap came off, can you fix it? - Sh. - Mama. - Sharon Rae, I just can't live like this. It's not my way. - Don't, not like this. - Ma'am I have to. - I need for you to tell me in person. - I don't think we better. - I'll try. - Who was that, Mama? - It was about the drapes, honey. - Here's that check Mr. Ramsey wanted to talk to you about. - Did you write this check knowing you didn't have the funds in your account to cover it? - Yes, I did. - Why? - 'Cause my word is good. - Well, can you cover it? - I've got some savings bonds at home I can bring in. - All right, we'll honor it. - I'm goin' to sale early next month, and I can make my payment. I need to get this loan started just as soon as possible. - Mr. Ramsey, we just don't have the money to loan. - But it takes money to make money. - Until we get the bank back on its feet, the money's just not there. - Without you, we're out of business. Without us, you're out of business. - That's absolutely my point, Mr. Ramsey. We'll have to hang together through this period, find some alternatives. - Can you go with the same amount as last year? - I wish I could. - Well, I guess I'll bring those bonds in. I'd just come home from Austin, been tryin' to scare up money, without much luck. - I have to trust what I feel. Please don't send me away. - It's not that I want to. It's that lies poison a man. - It isn't a lie. For the first time in my life, it wasn't a lie. - I guess I don't know what to do, Johnny. The last time I lied to myself about that woman, it cost me you, I don't know what it's cost me this time. - Lazarus State Bank. No, he's not. - Thank you. - Well hello Sheriff, what can I do for you? - Mr. Kimbrough, the Dallas police have two men in custody that fit the description of your wife's assailants. And they'd like Sharon Rae to identify the suspects as soon as possible. - Thank you, I'll take care of it right away. Right away. How's the cattle market? - Not good. Sale barn looks like a whore house on Easter Sunday. - John Joe. - I need to understand the cattle operation. I could use a guy like you to show me around, explain how it all goes. - Sure, anytime. - Looks good. Let me get it. Maybe one of these days we can get somethin' goin' for ya. Thanks John Jay, I'll drop by the sale barn. - Some you have to quarantine. Some they pack for dog food, if they don't lose it all. Some lose it all. Here, take a look. - Gibson. - Excuse me. - Get in touch with that Roshenberger bunch yet? He's waiting to hear from you. - I was going to, but I had to show Mr. Kimbrough, Mr. Kimbrough's our new banker. - Mm. - You should meet him. - Yeah, I'd like to. Mr. Kimbrough. - Dr. Laswell. - How are you? - Fine, how are you today? - Good to meet you. - Nice to meet you, sir. - Hope you enjoy it here. - Thank you. - You Joseph Anderson? - Yes, I am, come in. - What do you want? - Thought we might do some business. What kind of business? - We're not lookin' to get busted again. - An associate of mine recommended you. He said you were just released from a police lineup. - No positive ID. - What's that got to do with anything? - Let's just say you're good at not getting caught. - You're a cop, right? He's a cop, right Burt? - Could be, kid. - No, I'm not a cop. - Come on, I know you're a cop, your face pisses me off. - I assure you, I'm not a cop. - And we're suppose to take your word for that? Who are you? - A business man. Look, you boys could do me a favor, and I'm willing to pay for it. Half now, half when the job's done. - What's the job? - Keep 'em. I've got a gut feeling about you. I've decided that in your case, I need to operate more like August did. I'm gonna give you the full amount. - Thank you for betting on me. - I'm not. Go ahead, give her a try. - All right. - We get this bank back on its feet, get you some operating capital. - Back on its feet? - Go ahead, fire her up. Play the right card at the right time. - Daddy, do you wanna talk? - What am I suppose to do with this? - What the fuck am I, a doctor? Come on! Ah, shit! - Come on, this one fuckin' bit me, I say we take what we got and split. - Just shut up and get goin', come on! - What's wrong? - I'll be back in a minute, stay here. - There's somebody comin'. Go around the other side, hurry up. - Daddy, watch out! - No! - I've never been touched there before. - Ah-oh. - What? - Robin, get your clothes on. Kevin, you'd better go home. Hurry up. You sit right here until your father comes home. - Hi honey, I'm home. Hey, honeybee. - We have to talk. I found Robin with Kevin. I just think we need to do something. - Well, like what? - She doesn't have any structure. - What does that mean? - You just let her get by with anything. - So it's my fault. Whore! Oh Sherry. - Don't touch me. - Forgive me, I forgive you. - He knows. - Are you all right? - He's my husband. I'm sorry. - In obedience to our lord, Jesus Christ, and on public profession of your faith in him, I baptize you, Robin Kimbrough, in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Buried with him in baptism, rising to walk in the newness of life. - Heh, get outta there. There was a lot to be done now. Hauling cattle to the vet to get the test done quicker. Keepin' 'em in separate bunches till we could get the results back. Get up there, yah! But some how things just didn't add. I decided to have another look around. Well, the weatherman says it'll be sunny and hot today, with the high in the upper 90s. - Here you go. - Here, you play. Presently under clear skies it's 96 degrees. - I'll have it day after tomorrow. - Hey now. - I'll have it, okay. ♪ Be my slave ♪ Think of the memories I saved ♪ - Did you get those samples yet? - Yeah, just fixin' to run 'em. - All right, where's your bathroom? - Through here, take a left. ♪ For a little while ♪ Don't be sorry for me ♪ Reckon I got as well as I gave ♪ ♪ Just because she's - Mr. Kimbrough, please. ♪ Don't make her got to be my slave ♪ ♪ Think of the memories I'll save ♪ - Mr. Kimbrough?

You know, if you would've called Franklin, I'd have told you I don't have the time to talk. - Don't have time or won't take time? - Now don't you start with me. - Sam, are you tellin' me you don't have time to give me 10 minutes? - Franklin, I'd give you 10 hours if I thought it was worth it. The God's honest truth is I think you're beatin' a dead horse. Morning, Billy. - Well, good morning, Sheriff. - You know, if you'll just get shed of this thing Franklin, we can close the damn book once and for all. - I don't want the book shut. I want somebody to get to the bottom of this. And if you're not gonna do it, I am. - Dammit Franklin, those two boys broke into Gibby's office and stole that positive tube meaning to put your ranch under, it's plain and simple. - Why? - Hell, I don't know. Who knows how long a pair like that can hold a grudge. - That's the biggest bunch of bullshit I ever heard. - I got work to do. - Hey Sheriff, have you heard from my lawyer yet? - I'm sorry Miss, your time's up. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - All right, lock 'em up. Franklin! - All right everybody, back in your cages. - No more! - It's gettin' too hot for me over there. - Want somethin' cold? - No, coffee's okay. - If you're lookin' at the weather forecast, looks pretty much the same. Looking hot today, with the high in the upper 90s. - What's goin' on? - He lets one more nickel, they're gonna lower the whole shebang. - South at 15 miles per hour. 96 degrees outside, here's Miss Kimmie Carlisle. - Is this about Franklin? If anybody's good for it, Franklin is. You think I can get this out of his hide? - Listen, I'm still workin' on those samples. - What's goin' on, Gibson? - Just had to make a phone call. - There's some bad business stirring around here young man, and I expect you to tell me what it is. - I'll get 'em, just went to get a cup of coffee. I don't know, I'm not sure! - What you do know, you will tell the sheriff. Do I make myself clear? - Phone for you. - Who is it? - John Joe Gibson, I think. - Yeah. - I've done my part, now I want the money. - Listen, this is not the right time. - I don't know how you do things up in New York, but around here, we do what we said we would. - John Joe, the money's just not there. - Oh, there's money there. And you will get it for me. I know what you did. - What I did? - I saw you take it, and I'm prepared to tell 'em just that. - You think that's a problem for me? - Would you like to try it? - I can't raise it that fast. - Just depends on how bad you want to. - But why now, it's gonna be over before we ever get there. - Where is Kimbrough? - Daddy, don't drive so fast. - Shut up, Robin. - Hello. - I know I don't have the right to ask, but Richard and Robin haven't come home yet, and I'm worried, would you help me go find them? - Well, I was coming in anyway. - Thank you. Please find him. - You were there, you've known all this time. What's stopping you now? - As we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever, amen. - Daddy, what're you doing in here? - I was thinkin' about putting hay in here for the winter. I guess I was thinkin' about last winter. Must've been in here a hundred times and never thought about it. I guess I wouldn't let myself. This place is a part of Johnny, which makes it a bigger part of me. I wouldn't let myself see that for the longest time. - I don't understand it Daddy, any of it. - You're not suppose to, honey. You just pick up the pieces, and you live. You don't run from it, and you don't tell yourself it never happened, you just go on. - I love you, Daddy. - I love you too, Cathy. I came to tell you that there's somebody outside that wants to talk to you. - Okay. ♪ Amazing grace, how sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ I once was lost ♪ But now I am found ♪ I was blind but now I see ♪ It was grace that taught my heart to fear ♪ ♪ And grace, my fears relieved ♪ How precious did that grace appear ♪ ♪ The hour I first believed ♪ Amazing grace, how sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ I once was lost ♪ But now I am found ♪ I was blind, but now I see ♪ Amazing grace, how sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ I once was lost ♪ But now I am found ♪ I was blind but now I see
