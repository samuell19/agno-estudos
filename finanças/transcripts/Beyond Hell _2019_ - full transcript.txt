Come on come on somebody's got an answer. Yes Brook. Sex. Very elegantly put Brook. However she was in fact correct.

When I was in South America I went with a group of people to see a shaman. He introduced us to an ayahuasca based drug. A new form of changa that allowed us to go on a wild spiritual journey. It opens your mind to a whole new level of consciousness. Come on man. You know I can't mess with this shit. That's the best part man. It's all natural and the main ingredient is a chemical already produced in the brain. Think of it as tapping into your third eye. Oh, I'm in. Come on baby it'll be fun. Okay fine, fine. Alright, let's do this, okay. Okay, but if this comes back to bite me in the ass I'm gonna kill you. So how bout it bro? You say it's okay? Yeah I'm in. I don't think so guys. Oh, come on.

I was in this horrible place and there was this creature It held me down and it wouldn't let me go. You're hallucinating, alright. It didn't happen. It was so real where did all this blood Where did all this blood come from? Maryssa. Why are you covered in blood? I, I dunno I, I don't think it's mine. Oh. What the hell happened? Brook, what happened to his face? I don't know. No no, no, it wasn't me it wasn't me. What do we have here? It's a hell of a mess. Sounds like drugs are involved. What kind of bath salt shit is this? Good morning everyone. I uh, I know we're all aware of the, um, the tragedy that happened to one of your classmates I've been asked to remind you that there are counselors available at the school if you need anyone to talk to I will also be available to talk or anything right so uh, two ten please. Books to two ten. Get started. It's time to take your pills. Mouth open. Okay. This is fucked. Please don't. Who invited the psycho chick anyways man? Hey! This isn't the time or the place. Really then when's the right time or place to discuss this? There's enough blame to go around. I worked my ass off to get here okay. I'm no math wiz, I'm no English scholar. I play football, that's all I know. We'll find a way. You don't understand my parents can't afford to take me to school kay, they're relying on me for this Whatever I'm gonna go talk to coach, see if I can salvage my scholarship. I can't stay here. I can take you home. No. I just wanna be alone right now. I guess that just leaves us then. I gotta go. You wouldn't let a girl walk home feeling all alone and vulnerable would you? Are you serious? After everything that's happened do you ever Do you think about anyone but yourself? Maryssa? Calm down, calm down. It's okay, it's okay. What's going on? Are you okay? Coach! Is anyone in here? Come on. I've always commended humanity's drive to compete However, even Achilles had a weakness. What are you? What are you? I am what hell fears. Orderly restrain her. Ma'am please calm down. Get her up on the bed. Tyson, I'm so sorry. Please help me to understand something I have two dead students that were killed in ways I've never seen before a suspect, near catatonic in an asylum, that couldn't have committed the second murder. What the hell is going on? I saw Maryssa earlier that day. You, saw Miss Clarke earlier that day? Yes. I find that very hard to believe considering she's been under constant supervision since she arrived at the asylum. Now what's really going on here? Hey! You know the routine, don't leave town. Let's go talk to Maryssa. Woah. Sorry. It's not you. My mind was somewhere else. Are you sure it's a good idea to go see her? I need answers. I saw Maryssa around the time Tyson died, yet according to the detective she's been locked away. Did you actually see her? What's that supposed to mean? I'm just saying you seem to have it out for her. Prince charming to the rescue. Does that make you feel better taking shots at people? How little do you think of me? Since when do you care what anyone thinks? I'm sorry. I just don't understand what you have against Maryssa. Heather is my only real friend. Her and Maryssa grew up together, so whenever I'm around... I just feel like the third wheel. She has the perfect life. No ones perfect. She's good enough for you. Who are you? What's the matter don't you recognize yourself? Who are you? So demanding! I descend from a darkness long forgotten. I caused the fall of the angels, the creation of demons, I am Belial. Please, don't hurt me. Why won't you leave me alone. You are my deliverer. I've been imprisoned in the bowels of hell for an eternity. Until you came along. Now I'll show this world true evil. If I'm the one that freed you then leave my friends alone. Your friends think you're a killer. I will continue to kill your friends and consume their souls. No, no, no. That's enough! There are people here to see you if you can refrain from another outburst, I will allow it. Nod, if you have an understanding. We uh, we have some bad news about Tyson. He was found torn apart at the school. How do you know that? I had a visitor today. A creature called Belial. When we did the drug, we opened a gateway between his world and ours. Now he's gonna kill us off. One by one. There's no creature. We've all been through something traumatic, its just your mind trying to cope. Speak for yourself. Something came after me, and it looked like you. Somehow, the creature and I are linked. I watched through the creatures eyes each time he's come after one of you. I watched Seth and Tyson die. And there was nothing I could do about it. Do you hear yourselves? You sound- Crazy? I, I don't... What are we gonna do? Find out whatever you can about, Belial we need to learn more about what we're dealing with. I will, try to find a way out of here. Hang in there. You don't understand my friends are in danger. They're going to die. I agree. What did you say? You and your friends opened a gateway to Belial's realm. And now you are his link to this world. How do you know that? If he collects enough souls he'll be freed into this world and bring his followers with him. I'm sorry, we, we didn't know. Your stupidity will bring hell on earth. What can I do to stop him? The only way to stop Belial, is to sever the link. So in other words I have to die. Not necessarily. There is a ritual you can do, but time is running out. Once Belial has enough souls he'll be able to come to this world at will. Here's a list of ingredients and instructions. You'll also have to distract Belial. Once the ritual begins, he will know. Are you an angel? There are many realms and gods, you primitive hairless ape. Look, I'm sorry I didn't believe you back there, but, God, demons, other dimensions. You didn't take the drug, you didn't see what I did. I'm trying. Feels like judging. Look, we've all lost a lot and you're right, I don't know what you're going through. I'm here I'm not going anywhere. I won't let anything happen to you. Hey. I think you found something. Come on, take a look It says here that Belial was the angel that convinced Lucifer to rise against God. He then later turned on Lucifer in hell because he did not believe Lucifer was worthy enough to follow. He's the angel of darkness and those that followed him were known as the angels of destruction. Okay so he's the worst of the worst. It is prophesied that he will come to this world and be known as the anti-christ. Jake. Brook! Brook! Hey, hey, hey. Brook! Wake up. It's okay. Maryssa. Great timing. I'm sorry did I interrupt something? How did you get out? Someone helped me. Brook are you okay? I'll survive. Wait, what do you mean somebody helped you? Listen I can explain everything on the way. I have a plan to defeat Belial but I will need your help. We need the items on this list. I have some of this stuff here. Yeah, the rest we can pick up. What do you need this stuff for? A ritual. Belial's bound to me. The person who helped me escape told me how to sever the link. And you believed him? If you have a better solution, I'd like to hear it. I'm gonna need to change. You can change in my room. Wait, what was his name again? He didn't say. Right. Well, this is awkward. I owe you an apology. I was a jerk before, not believing you and Maryssa. Yeah, you were. I'm sorry. I'm over it. It's just that.. Just stop talking. Uh, we got everything we could here. Good, we'll get the rest on the way. You look, different. I've been through hell. Here are the supplies. Perfect. Okay, explain this plan to me again. Okay, we go back to Seth's house. You guys will do the ritual and I'll distract Belial. And how do you plan on doing that? I will retake the drug. Are you nuts? Do you have a better idea? Okay listen, let's just get Heather and then we can discuss it later. What's to discuss? I'm just saying. We're not going back to that house. I didn't say that we should. Okay, don't you guys get it? The longer we wait the more change that, that... What's wrong? We need to get to Heather, Now! Hurry! Hello. Heather! Tyson? Come to me. I missed you so much. Join me. Be with me. I don't know how. What, no kiss? He calls for you while he suffers all alone. I'll unite you, for all of eternity. No! Take your life child, and be with him. No. I can't. That's it. There's only one way you'll ever see him again. That's it. One thrust is all it takes and the pain starts to melt away. I can't. As you speak he screams your name. I can't do it. There there, you look like you could use a hug. Pain is merely a form of pleasure, which you will learn to embrace. Heather! It's okay, it's okay. No, no no no. Heather. Please, no. Heather. No, please, no. We're too late. Please, no. Please. Let's continue on. okay, let's keep going. If Seth has any more of that drug, it'll be in here. You can always count on Seth to have what you need. Is it there? Got 'em. Okay, let's get set up. Okay remember once I take the drug, time is of the essence. If Belial figures out what were- We know what we need to do. Adrenaline, in case we need it. Are you sure? We need it for the ritual. So gross. Good luck. Give 'em hell. I'll distract him as long as I can. Be careful. Here goes nothing. Let's get started. Aperta portae inferi ut transiret. Oh my God. Well don't stop, we have to keep going. Police, don't move. It's a, it's not what it looks like. Not what it looks like, you devil worshiping Bonnie and Clyde little fucks. Look, we can explain. Enough! I knew there was something wrong with you, back away from the girl. You don't understand. You have the right to remain silent- She needs our help. one more word- if you don't stop we're all gonna die. One more word and I will shoot you! So, you gonna shoot me or make me part of your sick sacrifice. I don't wanna kill you, but I will if I have to. Finish the ritual. So gross. Hello? Is somebody there? Heather? How is this possible? I escaped. Where is Seth and Tyson? Tyson, your boyfriend. I found a way out. Wait Heather, Heather, Heather! Slow down. Heather! Heather. How did we get here? Don't worry, you're safe. You have nothing left to fear. Is this some kind of dream? Relax. Stop. What are you doing? Stop it. Please. Where are you going? Just let go. We have so many wonders to show you. Belial! Where are you? Welcome back child. To what do I owe the pleasure? I've come to free the souls of my friends. Is that so. Yes! What do you have to offer in return? You can take me instead. You would give up yourself so willingly? Yes. You are the anchor. As long as you live, you will bring me souls. Besides, that's not why you're really here is it? What do you mean? You thought you could distract me while your friends performed While your friends performed their ritual. I have I have existed for an eternity. Did you really think you could fool me? Their souls belong to me now. However, if you're so determined to see your friends Then so be it. No. A taste of what's to come. No, no stop it. They have you to thank for their fate. My friends will finish the ritual and you will rot here. Did you really think the ritual would help you? What do you mean? The ritual will break the veil between two worlds and we will bring endless suffering. No, no. You really shouldn't talk to strangers little girl. Don't Stop. There's only one way you can help her now. Per dominum nostrum jesum christum mundi per dominum nostrum Jesum christum mundi sacrificii copulari. You're both gonna burn in hell. I couldn't agree more. Finish it. Veni inquit diaboli et manifestabo, Veni inquit diaboli et manifestabo! You've doomed us all! Foolish boy, you have damned your world. Maryssa! Jake No. Get the hell off me! My fallen brethren, we have been imprisoned for far too long. It is time we rise! And bring suffering to the race he chose over us. Rise! Rise my brothers. Rise! Brook! Embrace the horror child. All of this was made possible by you. The only way to stop him is to sever the link. Stop her! No! This is not possible! I will not be defeated. No! No! No, no. Maryssa. Maryssa! No, your not gonna die. Come back to us. Wake up! Move! Maryssa. I'm glad you're okay. I thought we'd lost you. Hey, where do you think you're going? Glad you're okay. Is somebody gonna help me up here or- Let's get out of here. Are you sure, I mean I could leave you guys here if you need some alone time. I think I likes her better when she was dead. Come on. Six more bodies washed up on shore today. This comes after a cargo ship was found abandoned just off the coast earlier this week. In what has become an all too familiar scene emergency crews are now cleaning up after the most recent attack on domestic soil. It is the third attack in as many weeks and no one has yet taken responsibility. A local community is devastated after their church became the most recent victim of increasing religious hate crimes around the globe. Fifteen are dead and one remains in hospital for observation. Heat continues to grow on government leaders for action as many are turning to the church for answers. The vatican has yet to comment. Quetzalcoatl. Subtle. I was feeling a little homesick. Why do you hide your true form? Humans are easier to manipulate when they're not cowering in terror. Perhaps. You let the ritual fail. I am free that is all that matters. You promised us an army. Try and hold yourself together. You will have your army. This is just the beginning.
