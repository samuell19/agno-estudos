Well... You guys home? Sweetie! There you are. Hey, daddy... Hey. Hey. Oh. Hey Mols'. You ready for your close-up? We're taking the family photo in front of the tree this year. Yeah, but we always decorate the tree together. I...I brought some ornaments from the old house. Oh wow. Hello darling. Hi mom! Hey. You know the service has been doing such a fantastic job on the exterior these past few seasons that I thought I'd have them do the tree this year. Yeah. It's just we always have so much fun decorating the tree together. Where is the angel? Somehow it got lost during the move. Oh, sorry Dad. I know that angel has been in your family ever since you were little. Yeah, it's a shame, I mean it... It's always my favourite ornament on the tree. I just loved sharing it with you girls. [soft laugh] Ah, it's okay. Time to make new memories. Exactly. I didn't realize you were so sentimental. Um. Michelle, tell your sister the big news. [under her breath] What? She's engaged. Your little sister is getting married! What! Harris finally popped the question? Mom. It's not official yet. But I did find a little bag from the jeweller and I think it could be any day now. Oh my gosh! I'm gonna be the maid of honour, right? [girls laugh together] Molly, baby. Is there anyone special you would like me to add to our list? Because I'm finalizing the guest list. Um... Nope. Just gonna be me. But I'm really excited to see everyone. That'll be nice. You know if you come back to work... You'd have steady hours again. And you'd be able to spend more time in your social life. How else are you going to find a Harris of your own? We haven't met somebody you've dated since Evan. Yeah, I'm just, I'm not really interested in finding another Evan. I'm interested in starting my own business. Alright. You get this out of your system, this app thing. And then... then you'll come back to Hoffman Accounting. Where you belong. You know how hard she's been working on creating Mingle All the Way. Yes, I do and it's a perfectly fine hobby to work on in your own time. You know, actually, mom... I've always wanted to start my own company. And Mingle All the Way, it's already up and running in the App Store. We have quite a few... users, that's... Mhmm. We'll talk about this again when daddy and I get back from Aspen. [sighs] Okay. Uh, so... let's, um, let's take this family photo. I kinda have to get back to my office and... Work on my hobby. Uncle Jeff! Greetings, family. Your decorations have arrived. Thanks, but you know we bought plenty of ornaments already. Oh, Frank, old buddy, you can't buy sentimental value. Some of these go back to when Erika and I were growing up. Still haven't found mom's angel. Sorry, sis. I looked everywhere. What angel? When your mom and I were kids, we used to go to the store every year to pick out a decoration with your grandmother. Sounds fun! Oh! Maybe we can go to the store to find one when we're done here. Sorry, kiddo. I have to go to the office this afternoon. This new ad campaign we're designing needs some serious fixing. That's what you always say. You're not even in the design department anymore, Jeff. Seriously, it's the weekend. You promised you'd help me with my Christmas stockings. I'm giving them to my whole class. I will, I promise. But first... Why don't we get this house properly decorated! Yes! Let's do it! Riley, for you and.. (whispers) What's in there? Thank you. Okay, come on. Let's get this tree put together. Do you think the notes cover everything? Maybe we should go over the presen- We checked them a zillion times. It's gonna be great! Let's just run the pitch one more time. Helen Lange isn't going to invest in my app unless the presentation is flawless. Let's take a deep breath. There is no time for breathing. Or eating. Don't you dare tell me that you've been sleeping. Mrs. Lange is already interested. That's why she's invited us to this breakfast meeting at her private club. But you might actually scare her off if you show up looking like a deranged zombie. Okay. Fine. I promise that I will go to bed at a reasonable hour if you show me the updated logo. Agreed. And maybe you could do something fun one of these days? You remember "fun" right? There will be plenty of time for fun once we get Mingle All the Way on the map. Ta-da! [knock at door] Molly? Are you in here? Lisa! Hi! Yeah, come on in! Hi! Hi! Oh, and welcome, you are now officially in the Mingle All the Way headquarters. Well, temporary headquarters. We'll have a proper office soon enough. This is awesome. Lisa, meet Tyler, my business partner and incredible graphic designer. Tyler meet Lisa, my most successful friend. What are you doing here? I just wanted to wish you good luck. Oh, that's so sweet. It's great to finally meet you, actually. I've heard so much about Molly's genius college roommate. Oh. [laughs nervously] Hardly! Molly is the real genius. I've made my match for the season and I'm ready to mingle thanks to her incredible system, I no longer have to answer why I'm not seeing anyone... again. Or go to my work functions alone. Exactly. I invented my App for people just like you. It's gonna be huge. I am so proud of you for following your dreams. Thanks. You are coming to my Christmas office party, right? I think I'm over Christmas. It's just become such a corporate ordeal. How can you be over Christmas? You have to come! The only way I was able to get Swift Technologies off the ground is because I took networking so seriously. You might meet potential investors. Fine. You know, you two make a very convincing team. I just hope that your idea of a holiday party is much more personality than my mother's. You'll enjoy it, I promise. Oh, and hey Molly. If you have any worries with your Christmas parties, you can always join Mingle All the Way. Uh, that won't be necessary. Somebody has to stay here and handle the business. Um, I'm right here. Mhmm. Yo, Jeff! Hey are you still working on that Brady mock up? Is that code for "thanks Jeff for fixing my disastrous "efforts on this ad campaign" 'cause I'm happy to help. Hmm. You're needed in the boardroom. Mr. Grayson is making an announcement. That, uh, looks surprisingly sharp... ...Ish. She's a successful CEO, career driven, and a leader in her field. Yet whenever she is invited to a corporate event, the only thing people ask her is who she's dating and why she isn't married yet. See, Lisa doesn't want you to set her up on a blind date. She wants your business card. My niece has a similar complaint. She's a lawyer. Well yes, your algorithm is rather impressive. That's actually why I invited you here today. I'm interested in working with emerging innovators in tech. Molly is even being interviewed on the local news this week as an entrepreneur to watch. We believe that our app is ready for the next level. With an infusion of capital we could hire a full staff and market on a larger scale. Tell me, why is Mingle All the Way different than all the other dating apps out there? Because our matches aren't created for romance. Excuse me? Unlike traditional dating apps, Mingle All the Way isn't for people looking for a relationship. Our users are perfectly happy remaining single, they simply need someone to go to an event with them. Imagine showing up at your industry party or parties with an ambitious and intelligent person on your arm. Not only do you make a great impression, but you have someone to navigate the crowd with. Once a match is made, our pair agrees to a set of events where they will be each other's platonic plus one. We find it to be an extremely efficient networking arrangement. I know a ton of friends that would love to try something like that. Before I invest in anything I would really like to see it in action. So, tell me, Molly. Do you use Mingle All the Way? As a matter of fact, she just joined. Molly has so many parties to attend this season we agreed it was the perfect time for her to experience Mingle All the Way for herself. Why don't I demonstrate why mingling is the next major social innovation? Alright. Why don't you spend the next few weeks as a Mingle All the Way user, and then bring your match to our Christmas gala? If I'm aptly impressed, who knows? There might be an investor in your stocking. Sounds great. Wonderful. Hello, everyone. I am delighted to share some very exciting news. Grayson Advertising will be opening its first Los Angeles office right after the holidays. [applause] Now, the person I appoint to run this new office will be someone who fits with our corporate philosophy. And here at Grayson, we value stability and commitment in our executives. That's very reasonable, sir. I'll be making my decision before the new year. [applause] Thank you. Would you and Melissa still be able to join us for dinner tonight? Absolutely. We can't wait. I can just send you a postcard from L.A. Slow down, Brent, we're both in the running for this. Plus, I look good in a tan. ♪ ♪ Welcome to Treasures. Candy cane? Oh, no thank you. Is that an original Reynolds department store angel? Sure is. Someone just brought her in this morning. Oh. my goodness. That's amazing! It looks exactly like one I had as a little girl. Thanks. ...the spacing probably needs to be 30 percent bigger or it's not going to look right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay, I'll just adjust it when I get back to the office. Oh, um, ex- excuse me. I was just about to buy this angel and... Oh. I just saw it a moment ago but I had to take a call. Oh, is there a problem? No, I hope not. It's just I saw this angel first and I was going to bring it up and I was going to buy- That's not how shopping works. I was going to start a tradition with my niece- I was supposed to surprise my dad and it would mean a lot- And this is going to kick off her collection. I'm more than happy to help you find something for your dad. Should we flip a coin? [cellphone ringing] No, it's... I really need to take this call. Hey Tyler, what's up? Wait, I really will help you shop! [phone rings] Hey Michelle, what's up? It's official! Harris and I are engaged! [laughs] Mom is already obsessing over the plans. As my maid of honour, I need you to be 100 percent on board. We can talk about it at the pre-Christmas dinner. Your wish is my command. Uh, Mols, are you sure you don't want me to talk to Harris about, you know, fixing you up with his cousin Mark? Yeah, uh, yeah I really don't. Um, but thanks. I know you haven't had the best of luck dating, but, you know if you just change your- You know what actually, Michelle, I, I uh, I'm getting ready for my news interview. So I gotta go. Um, I'll talk to you soon. Okay! Fine. Good luck. And... Congrats. [TV anchor] As the holiday season approaches, are you dreading the question, "Why are you still single?" If so, there's a new app developed right here by one of Cedar Falls' own that could be the solution for you. Using Mingle All the Way, you make a match and agree to accompany each other to your seasonal events. Purely platonic, no pressure and- I guess there is an app for everything these days. Okay, listen. Well, I am on my way back to the office right now, so I will see you soon and you are amazing Tyler. Okay. Oh! Oh! Oh that's... that's really great. That really adds some unique detail. Here. -You! -You! Here you go, listen I'm really sorry. Um... I could buy you some new Christmas stockings if you want. These aren't for sale. I made these all myself. Oh, really? Well, um, I could help you clean them? It's fine, really. I have a creative process. I didn't realize Christmas stockings were so artistic. It's okay, look, just try not to mess up anyone else's aesthetic vision today. Okay? I gotta go. Yeah, well you try not to steal anyone else's Christmas gift idea today. Wow. Hi! So I'm thinking we hang this up until we move into a real office. And we'll change the seasonal motif of the artwork throughout the year. Easter eggs for spring, beach umbrellas for summer, autumn leaves for fall... You're the best. You think we're ever going to be able to afford this? Definitely. We are going to get this investment. I know it. Yeah. I wish I had your confidence. What's your secret? Just... Look inside yourself. You'll find it was there all along. [laughs] Okay. So, Molly Hoffman, are you ready to start your Mingle All the Way profile? Oh, I still can't believe you burst out with that suggestion. Why? Number one, it's a great way to show Mrs. Lange how the app actually works. Number two, I think it'll actually do you some good. Well, I guess if I do have to go to all those tedious Christmas parties then I can kill two birds with one stone. That's the spirit. Sort of. And, as a bonus, you get to give your social life some much-needed attention. Is my mother brainwashing you? She does have a point. You know what, it is old-fashioned comments like hers that motivated me to start Mingle All the Way in the first place. [sighs] My mother wants me to spend all of my energy finding a boyfriend but I have no intention of being diverted by a relationship. [Christmas jingle] ♪ So pretty. Hey. Hey! You made it! Hey Riley! I think these are what you've been waiting for. Perfect, thanks Uncle Jeff! You're welcome, kiddo! That's for you. So, I think I need to find a date. That's a great idea. It's about time you got back out there. Don't get too excited, it's nothing romantic. But Mr. Grayson keeps inviting my colleagues out to these couples dinners and I need to be included. There's no other way you can get his attention? Not really. All the top execs are family types and I need to fit in. Well... It wouldn't be a tragedy for you to go out once in a blue moon. There's more to life than work. Focusing on the business side of the company is how I'll move up. Please, just help me with this promotion. You must know some single women I could take to my office Christmas party. None that want to play pretend with you. Okay, my friend... Enough stalling. Enough analytics. It's profile time. You're right. Talking about myself is my least favourite hobby but I can't put it off any longer. But I can see that you kind of want to, so, how about this: You go outside, get some fresh air, find something to do that doesn't involve sitting in front of a computer and I'll set it up for you instead. I think I know your hobbies well enough to get it sounding like you. You are a prince. Oh! But hey. Don't put anything cheesy on my profile, okay? No long walks at the beach or anything like that. Got it. Business plans and spreadsheets it is. And I'll add some personal stuff to give it some flavour. Nothing too personal, but you know, you want a match that you can have a good conversation with, right? Yeah and go ahead and add puppies on the list. You know, any guy that likes puppies must be tolerable company. Deal. Now get out of here! So, what's your game plan? You ever heard of Mingle All the Way? You're joining online dating? Not quite. It's a unique thing for networking but I think it's my best option if I want to impress Mr. Grayson. And besides, I don't hear you throwing out any ideas. Oh, well, no, I am setting you up right now before you change your mind. I will arrange everything. Just make me sound appealing. Uh, girls like puppies. Girls are into that, right? [laughs] Okay, I'll text you with my upcoming schedule. Thank you so much, sis. Trust me. And I will let you know as soon as I've got your first date set up! Okay. Thanks. Bye! [sighs] Once he dips his toes back in the dating world he is gonna remember how great it is to have a real relationship. [Jazzy version of "Jingle Bells"] ♪ [Jazzy version of "Jingle Bells"] ♪ Yes! ♪ Morning, partner! Morning! So, have you heard any news from Mrs. Lange? Yup, I told her you're good to go. I will monitor your progress and send her updates as your events unfold. Starting tonight, by the way. Oh, so you found a match then? How does he sound? You think we'll get along? Oh, definitely. You're match score was 94 percent. Your schedules align perfectly and according to the personality component, you have loads of compatible interests. Well, that's a relief. At least we'll have something to talk about. What can I say, your algorithm is perfect. So, Jeff will meet you at 7:00pm at the coffee stand near Lisa's party. I figured since we encourage our matches to meet up one on one to make sure they're comfortable, you should do the same. Yeah, definitely. That's perfect. I'll show all the ins and outs of how Mingle All the Way works. It will be great, I promise. Oh, also, your profile does say that you work for a tech start up, but I thought it best to leave out the whole "you developed the app" thing. So, I left that part vague. Smart! This guy might get a little concerned if he thinks I have access to his information. Exactly. Oh! Molly. Uh, one more thing. Yeah. Wear something... festive. Okay. Excuse me, are you Jeff? Three times in one week? At least no collisions this time. Ugh, and they say good things come in threes. Oh no. Are we... are you... Molly? Guilty as charged. Listen, my friend arranged this for me, okay? I didn't rzeou were my match. I would never- Trust me, neither would I! I knew I should've let my sister set up my profile. Here. Looks like I got that for you. Extra whipped cream. Nice touch. So this is probably a mistake, let's just forget about this. We could both rematch with other people. I mean, I could find someone a little more gentlemanly. And I can find someone a little less clumsy. On second thought, they say third time's a charm. Are you saying you actually want me to be your guest? Mm-hmm. Yes please. Listen, it'll at least be entertaining. And I'll still go with you to your office party tomorrow. And you'll promise not to trip all over me? And I can have your dessert? Uh, I'll try my best and sure. Deal. [inaudible conversation] You came! Wow, Lisa, this is so elaborate. Oh, let me introduce you to Jeff. Jeff this is Lisa. Lisa, Jeff. Pleasure to meet you, Jeff. Pleasure's all mine. Molly, wow. You look fantastic. If I had known what colour you were going to wear I would have matched it to my tie. How sweet. Looks like you have a real gentleman on your hands. Hmm. Oh, yeah, chivalry is alive and well. And what kind of work are you in, Jeff? Advertising. I'm in business development at Grayson but I started as a designer. Amazing. I want to introduce you to Kevin. Yes, yes please. Kev. We have Molly to thank for pairing us up this season. I love what you've created, Molly. I can't take all the credit for it. I just make the suggestion and it's up to you to see who suits you best. That's true. So how do you guys know each other? Oh, we met the traditional way. Girl meets boy, boy ruthlessly steals girl's amazing Christmas gift idea. Girl mercilessly ruins boy's Christmas stockings. The standard stuff. One of my biggest clients just arrived. I have to say hi. But you guys circulate, enjoy yourselves. Nice to meet you both. Likewise. So, am I behaving acceptably for you? Yeah. So far so good. But the night is young. Hmm. Oh! Actually, ladies first. Oh, no I wouldn't dream of it. Taking the last item is your signature move, right? Hmmm... So, have you done anything like this before? Mingle All the Way, I mean. Oh, no. But, I hear it's great. I don't know, I think it's a little weird, honestly. But, desperate times, as they say. I'm sorry, are you calling me desperate? Because as I recall, you also needed a plus one. I'm sorry, I was referring to myself. I need someone impressive to introduce to my boss so he'll invite me to his personal events. So you're sayin' I'm impressive? Oh yeah. Ooh. Now we're talking. If you will remember our deal. Oh, um, yeah. Uh, is it possible to get one of these cakes with the whip cream on the side? Of course, you're one of those. One of what? The type who can't just enjoy something without making it complicated. Okay, cool. Mm-hmm. I stand corrected. So I gather your start up's also in tech? You here, what, scoping out the competition? Oh no, Lisa's my best friend. And our companies are really different. I mean, mine's an app for efficient scheduling. Well, she throws one heck of a Christmas party. Yeah, if you're into that sort of thing. Who isn't into Christmas? I don't know. I'm kind of over it. I feel like it's a whole lot of obligations and fanfare for nothing. It's just not enjoyable anymore. Now I get it. Get what? You're a Grinch. I knew there was something off about you. Lack of holiday spirit. What? No, that's not it at all, I'm just really busy so I'd rather focus, you know, all of my energy on work instead of waste time with phony emotions. Waste time... enjoying the most magical time of the year? You're messing with me. Wrong. I live for this season. [laughs] Maybe someday you'll get to try my famous eggnog. The secret ingredient is cheer. [laughs] Okay...yeah, stop. Mind if I take a pic of you two? Oh, uh, no- Nonsense, yes- That's embarrassing. Oh-ho-ho! No, I don't wear props. Yes! I don't wear props! [snaps photos] Oh, come on. Say Christmas! Christmas! So? How is Jeff? Awful. He is totally smug, he is way too into Christmas, and, to top it all off, he's the guy I told you about who stole my dad's Christmas gift. What? Yep. Seriously? Mhmm. Man, uh, he seemed like a perfect match. His profile was ideal... It's fine. I don't have to like the guy. I just need someone who will go on a few work events with me over the holidays. Fair enough. Well, I'll leave the negative report of Jeff out of what I send Mrs. Lange and hope for the best, I guess? Our photos are already uploaded to Lisa's company website so you can forward those to her as well. Nice. Further proof of the two of you together. Let's check this out. Wow. You wore props. He wore props. Nope, you can just go ahead and turn that around because I am not in the mood at staring at his annoyingly handsome face all morning. Well, hopefully your mood changes because you're going to be staring at that annoyingly handsome face all night. Yeah, yeah. Hey, Brady team wants to see the budget for their campaign. Here. And tell them they can contact me directly if they have any feedback about the new design. No, it's not necessary. Mr. Grayson made me point person on all the creative decisions so I'll just take it from here. He did? How? Oh, hey. Did Mr. Grayson invite you to the carolling night? Oh. No, that's right. It's a... it's a couples only thing. Never mind. [phone rings with a holiday tune] Hey sis. So how was the date? It was not a date. And it was not great, if you must know. Ugh. You're being picky, as usual. She is the most uptight person I have ever had to spend an evening with. She is basically a fun exterminator, who already can't stand me, by the way. So did you call it off? Nah. She's the type who tucks her shirt in. Mr. Grayson's gonna love that. [Instrumental Christmas tune] ♪ [Instrumental Christmas tune] ♪ Right on time. Just as I predicted. You're not actually expecting me to skate, are you? As I recall, you accused me of being clumsy. Well, I assumed you'd be resistant to the general concept of fun so I took the liberty of renting these. Just a few laps on the ice for show, and a stop in the restaurant to introduce you to my boss. So are there any activities you don't enjoy or is everything fun and games to you? Well, I don't love... folding my laundry, but who does? I find it very therapeutic. Why am I not surprised? ♪ Oh Jeffrey, there you are. Brent was just telling me all about his honeymoon. I'm actually working on a pitch for a travel company. You know, I thought I could use my own vacation as inspiration. I... I'd love to work on it with you. Well, actually I need you to crunch the financials. But Brent, why don't you and Melissa stop by this weekend for lunch and we can take a look at some of your ideas? Jeffrey, you have not introduced me to your guest. So sorry, where are my manners? Mr. Grayson, Brent, may I introduce you to Miss Molly Hoffman. My girlfriend. It's a pleasure to meet you. Pleasure's all mine. Jeffrey hasn't mentioned that he's been seeing anyone. Well, I tend to keep my personal life... personal. That's all. Molly. Mhmm. Just curious, has Jeff told you about his interest in moving to L.A? Oh, yes, of course he has. Jeff and I tell each other everything. And I fully support his dreams. Thank you. Well, choosing the right person to head up the L.A. office is certainly going to be a tough decision. Oh, well whenever I'm faced with a difficult choice I just make a rigorous list of pros and cons and then I cross reference it with objective statistical data. I find it very helpful. Okay darling, no need to get all nerdy on us. Quite prudent, young lady. Jeffrey, don't go hiding her away anymore. Say, would you two like to join me and my family for carolling next week? Um, uh... We wouldn't miss it. Well, that's terrific. Now, if you'll excuse me. So how... how did you two kids meet anyway? Oh, well, Jeff and I met at a negotiation seminar. Jeff bested me, he has a finely-crafted technique. You are being far too kind. We both know you let me win. Oh, no. You know I, I, I would love it if you could just maybe just show me a tip or two. I'd be delighted. Just as soon as I tweak your latest design. Okay, it doesn't need tweaking. It's fine. You killed it. That was amazing. What were you doing? What? What do you mean? I mean, you had no business calling me your girlfriend. I mean, come on Jeff. You know how the app works, it's for networking. Not fake relationships. I got a little impulsive. But it worked and it was amazing and my sister is going to owe me a drink when I see her tomorrow. Tell your sister that you will be carolling alone. [sighs] Ty, I think I completely messed up. Do you think it would be too late to start over with a new match? Be honest. Hmm. It's not ideal. I mean, Mrs. Lange's already seen both your profiles and how the match was generated. So yeah, it's not going to look good to tell her your first match was a misfire. Especially since you created the app. Right. [phone ringing] Perfect timing. Hi mom! How are you? Good. I was just calling to see if you're still on for family dinner. Well, that'll be nice. Is there anything I can bring? Maybe a dessert? No, Michelle is making her apple pies so, just bring yourself. I don't suppose there's any reason to set an extra place at the table, right? For a guest. Because I. I..as s wpeaking with Vivian, our old neighbour, and she said that her son Phillip was back in town. So I was thinkin- Well, tell Phillip he'll have to find another date because I have a new boyfriend. Up, up, okay. A little higher, higher. There, yeah. Hi. Excuse me. Listen, I know you're having a private event but I'm just looking for Jeff? Oh, uh, he's right there. Thanks. Look, I made a mistake and if you would just let me- Look, I have a proposal for you. You need help with your boss and now I need help with my mother. So, what if we just keep our events as planned plus dinner with my family and then I will say whatever it is you want me to say to your boss. Would you like to be my fake boyfriend for Christmas? I thought you'd never ask. Actually do have a potential client dinner coming up tonight. Oh, well I would just be delighted to join you, darling. Hmm... Wow, this place hasn't changed a bit. Sorry, I have to see this. I... I used to live nearby when I was a kid and when my parents would work late my sister and I would do our homework here after high school. So you've always been a nerd? Huh. Wow, that must have been back when Frank senior was running things. Do you think, maybe, if we knew each other back then we'd get along? During high school? Not a chance. I was cool. Oh, please. You were president of the AV club all four years. [laughs] Oh, you can never tease me again. Hey there, I am Molly and you are clearly my new best friend. What do I owe you for that bit of information? Yeah, that one's on the house. I'm Erika. I'm Jeff's sister. Oh, sorry to hear that. [laughs] Uncle Jeff, we're ready to start decorating the ornaments. Why don't you say hi to Molly here. Hi there! Oh, my gosh I... I love your outfit. Do you work for Santa? That's just my dad. The real Santa's in the North Pole. Don't tell. She's really cute. Uh, well, I should go. Jeff just text me where to meet you later, okay? No! Stay. You can help me with my ornaments. We make them every year. Well actually, I think Molly is allergic to Christmas. That is a terrible thing to say. I would love to help you, but you know you're going to have to help me because I don't know what I'm doing. Okay. I'm going to find my favourite paintbrush. You can use that one. Okay. Oh, so sweet. She is. I better go help her. You're gonna be alright? Oh, yeah definitely. Me and my new gal pal, we're gonna swap some juicy stories about you. Yup. [sighs] Hey, I, um, I know that you guys didn't exactly hit it off at first, but I can assure you, my brother is a really good guy. Yeah, he'll make a decent wing man. I'm glad he's out socializing. And it's good that you guys matched, even if it is only for business purposes. That is all it is, right? Yep. Yeah, I mean business is up and running so I don't have time for a relationship. Well, I guess you both had good reasons for joining Mingle All the Way. Mm. Huh. Come on! Everything's ready! Oh, good. This'll be fun. Wow, I, uh, I wish I'd knew we were gonna be crafting today. I... I have zero aptitude for this stuff. Aptitude? This isn't the SAT. It's called merriment. Oh! [laughs] I'm sorry. It's forgivable. This doesn't look like a networking arrangement to me. I wouldn't get your hopes up. Don't! So, I've been trying to land this account for ages. Hmm-Mm. I haven't brought in any significant new clients in a few months so this would be a really big win for me. Okay, well, let me know if there is anything in particular you want me to say. I have so many ideas for a new Diamonds are Forever campaign. Heather, you should know that Jeff has a very thorough creative process. I like the sound of that. You could even call it his aesthetic vision. Jeff, why don't you send me a cost proposal of what you have in mind and we'll take it from there. You'll have it before the holidays. Wonderful.

Are you asking me to dance? Maybe. ♪ After you. ♪ ♪ ♪ [door slams] Morning Ty! I brought us a peppermint latte. Thanks! That's very merry of you. This looks cheerful. Did you do all this? No, Lisa offered to help in exchange for my graphic design know-how. Apparently, I was recently described as incredible. Lisa was here? When? Yesterday, while you were getting things squared away with Jeff. Are things squared away with Jeff? Don't lie to me. Are you guys still a match 'cause I need to update the report for Mrs. Lange. All straightened out. We even went to a party together last night. But don't worry, I made it Mingle All the Way official so you can send the details to Mrs. Lange. I think this plan is actually going to work, Ty. Good. That's a relief. Uh, one more thing. Dress more festive? Okay, two more things. I think you should write about your experience with Jeff for the website. What like a founder's testimonial? Yeah, it'll be the piece de resistance for Mrs. Lange. Lisa's also teaching me French. Hmm. Well, thanks so much for making time for you dad, sweetheart. Yeah. Of course! I would never miss our annual pre-Christmas hot chocolate date. Wish we kept up with more of our old traditions. Mom's been even more... intense than usual this year. She only wants the best for you. Here, I made some notes on the uh, Mingle All the Way figures that you sent me. [laughs] You've done a terrific job, sweetheart. I can tell how passionate you are about this. Thanks daddy. I really appreciate that. Well, I should get going. Meeting this boyfriend of yours? I'll see ya in a couple days. I love you, daddy. I love you too. Wow. I didn't expect to see a restaurant moon lighting as a gift-wrapping centre. Technically, this is a Grayson event. We like to support local organizations whenever we can. It's part of an ongoing charitable program. I offered up the restaurant this year as a gift-wrapping venue. Um, I think you meant to say that I offered up the restaurant this year. It's nice to see you, Molly. Good to see you too, Erika. So sis, where should we set up? Molly is a Christmas novice so maybe we should stick to the cards? Oh no, no. I might not be artistic, but I am amazing at gift wrapping. Alrighty. Mhmm. Perfect. Two seats, right there! Excuse me. After you. Perfect. Okay. The kids are going to be so excited when they get all of these gifts. Sure. Our company actually donated toys this year. They're gonna be dropped off at the children's hospital on Christmas Eve. Oh, that's nice. Um, for once, my dear brother here is being far too modest. This is his event. He organizes all of Grayson's charitable events. This was your idea? Oh. So are you working on any commercials lately or are you responsible for creating the concepts or what? Unfortunately, I don't really get to spend a lot of time I am kind of just a corporate suit now. Oh. Do you miss it? Yeah. But my ex, Ashley, she's the one who encouraged me to make the switch. She always thought there was more growth potential on the business side. The more I thought about it, the more I kind of figured she was right. So then, uh, your colleague, Brent, he does all the designing? Yeah. Except he doesn't have a creative bone in his body. He pawns off all his work on everyone else and takes all the credit. Mr. Grayson doesn't notice it? Nah. He sees Brent's persona as a viable team player. But, if everything goes well, Mr. Grayson will be hearing about me and my girlfriend representing the company tonight. Oh yeah. I got your back, babe. Thank you. I guess I could use a fresh start in L.A. Oh, before I forget. Mhmm. I made you a little something. It's just a little gesture to apologize for making you feel uncomfortable at the rink. You drew this? Yeah. Thank you. You know you really didn't need to walk me home. Well, it may not have been a real date but I am still a real gentleman. Thank you. Sometime. [laughs] So what does a woman like you need Mingle All the Way for anyway? I mean you're not so bad to be around. [laughs] Thanks. I guess I just use it for the same reason as most Mingle All the Way users. You know, I want someone to join me for the holiday party circuit but I don't want to have to worry about romance. A real partner in networking crime. Mhmm. [whistles] That is a handsome fern. Where did you get your Christmas tree? I don't have a Christmas tree. You don't have a... [grunts] Is grinchiness part of your heritage, 'cause I need to know what I'm fake-dating into here. No. When I was little we did the whole traditional Christmas thing. And I absolutely loved it. But then I got to high school and my mom decided that winter break would be the perfect time to take a ski vacation instead of celebrating at home, so... I don't know. Every year has just gotten a little less special. What's it like now? My parents still go to Aspen every year for Christmas. Ever since their company started doing really well my mom just became hyper focused on impressing her clients. That, and wondering about my dating prospects. You'll see. I'm sorry. Christmas isn't fun, or merry or really a true holiday for me anymore. Couldn't take the heat. So you got outta Santa's kitchen. [laughs] Come on, come on, let's go. Come on. Okay, sounds good. Bye. Well, Mrs. Lange sounds happy. She's loving all the pictures from your events so keep em coming. And I told her I'd send her some more screen shots of what it looks like on the app too. Oh, good. You know I almost slipped up yesterday about being Mingle All the Way's founder. I will be relieved when this is all over. I bet you will. [text alert] That looks good. [laughs] What's funny? Just confirming tonight. [text alert] Okay. I'll see you after lunch. Oh, and I started my founder's testimonial, will you take a look at that? Will do. Jeff recommended this place. He works around the corner, so, hope you like it. Good. Things are still going well with Jeff? He's so cute. Yeah, hey Lisa listen, we're not actually dating. We're just using Mingle All the Way. I'm sorry, I should have told you sooner. Oh, that's too bad. I thought you were giving dating a real shot. This, from Mingle All the Way's biggest fan? Yes, I am. I am only using the app for now. Thank you. Kevin and I have gotten along just fine using Mingle All the Way but I think I'm finally ready to start looking for that special someone. That's great, Lisa. Well, any guy would be lucky to be with you. I could say the same thing about you. Picture your ideal guy. Alright. Um. He would have a quality education, analytical skills, great at time management... Do you want him to have a fast typing speed too? Ooh, that would be good. I'm kidding! Are you looking for an office manager or a boyfriend? [laughs] Accomplishments are important to me too but, what about personality? Okay, fine. What's on your list? Hmmmm. I'm looking for someone who can make me laugh. Mhmm. But also, I can have a serious conversation with. Hmm. Most of all, I want someone who can see the real me. Yeah but, aren't you concerned that you'll lose yourself to the relationship? That's what happened with me and Evan. That's why it had to end. I don't think that happens when you find the right person. Molly. You are a catch. And you deserve to be happy. [phone ringing] Hey Michelle. What's up? I just finished shopping for mom and dad. I had to buy all my gifts online this year. Enough with the small talk. Are you going to tell me about your boyfriend? It's not really a big deal. Not a big deal? I want the details! You know what, uh, I will have to tell you later 'cause I am going to an event that Stephanie Rowlands is hosting. Oh! That's amazing. You've been following her career forever. But, okay, just give me something... You'll get to meet him tomorrow. Bye! [sighs] Hey! You're looking rather joyful today. Thanks. Hi Molly. Uncle Jeff had to baby sit me today. Is it okay I'm here? Yes, it is more than okay. I'm so excited to see you! He told me you were coming. We're going to have a lot of fun. Have you ladies met Molly Hoffman? No, hi, I'm new to the group. Uh, Ms. Rowlands it is an honour. Hi. Your book inspired me to start my company. Molly is going places. Big places. I suggest you take her card. Do you want an apron? I actually don't think that you want me anywhere near icing, if that's okay. That is certainly not okay. You are our teammate. And our team plans to win. Oh. Let's go get us ingredients. Get some good ones! I'm Molly. Hi. This is great, you know. Hi! Oh, hi, hi! Hi Tyler, I didn't know you were coming. Neither did I. Kevin is sick so I asked Tyler to join me as my baking partner. And you know how much I love competitive baking. You love competitive anything. Wow, your uncle is very talented. What can I say? My family watches a lot of baking shows. Clearly. [laughs] I just never quite mastered the art of gingerbread house making. No, but you look cute trying. Hey, you know what, if we don't win, you are a huge hit with this crowd. Thanks a lot for talking me up. Stephanie Rowlands and I are actually going to have lunch together. First of all, we're definitely going to win. [laughs] Second of all, my pleasure. It's what I'm here for. [laughs] Oh wow. Don't quit your day job, Lis. [laughs] I think they need some help. I think they need a lot of help. Yeah. Oh, I didn't know we were allowed to heckle. "A" for effort though. Thank you sir. Don't listen to him. So, that's your business partner? Well, you never told me anything about your app. Oh, it's um, it's, it's called "Book It". And well, the details would just bore you. I just need to get a lot of investors so I don't have to close up shop and go back to work for my parents. Would that be so bad? It's just my whole life my parents have really wanted me to follow a certain path and I've always wanted to be my own boss, you know. Not have things handed to me. Make your own mark. I respect that. Thanks. Yeah, so, I figure, you know, if I can't make it with Min- with, with my app, then at least I know I tried, right? Okay everyone, it's time to announce our winner! Okay, okay. In first place goes to team Riley. [applause] Yay! Yes! Hey! You ready to meet my mom? It'll be fine. Moms love me. So what should I expect? Roast beef for dinner with a side of criticism. Oh, my gosh. I have to get this for my mom. I can never compete with Michelle's perfect gifts. Here. Could you help me find Riley's perfect gift instead? Thank you for letting me come along. Yeah. Despite my past shopping behaviours. Yeah. Well, we have come a long way. And you know what I would be happy to help you find a gift for her because she has been talking to me about this doll that she wants and I know exactly where to find it. Thank you! Merry Christmas. Come on. ♪ Relax. I'll be right by your side and I promise to make this night fun. [nervous laugh] [knocks on door] Okay. Molly, what are you doing outside, you'll catch a chill. Come, come. Yeah. You must be the boyfriend. Such a pleasure to finally meet you, Mrs. Hoffman. Thank you. I brought you my famous eggnog. Okay, thanks. Everyone, this is Jeffrey. Molly's new beau. Hi. Thanks for including me tonight. Wow. This room could be in a catalogue. Oh, yeah. Isn't it fabulous. It's beautiful. I think they used a new synthetic on the pine needles. Hmm. Maybe. Excuse me. Oh, thanks. Ho, ho! Who is this? Should I be jealous? That's Evan, Molly's college boyfriend. Nice to meet you, Jeff. Hi. Jeffrey why don't you sit down and tell us about yourself? y hasn't shared anything. Oh, uh, well Jeff works at Grayson Advertising. Oh. I played golf with Lloyd Grayson. He is an excellent golfer. Wow, I'd love to join you sometime. Oh. Jeff works at a company that provides a 401K. I have a 401K. So what's on the agenda? Should we play a game? Well, typically we do our gift exchange prior to sitting down for dinner. Oh great. Molly should go first. This is for you, sir. Thank you. You left that one in the car. Open the present. Oh, I can't believe it. How did you find a replacement? This is so wonderful! Look... Look at that! Well, I'm so glad that you love it, daddy. Um, Jeff actually helped me with that one. Oh, let me see. Look Harris. Yeah, it's the one that broke. But what about Riley and starting your new tradition? I just figured we'd go to the store and pick out something new together. I wanted you to have the angel. Okay. Who's next? Um, Harris. This one is for you. Here you go. Okay. It's a fitness monitor so you can sync it to an app on your phone. Oh, thank you. Yeah. Kids and these apps, my gosh. I mean, in our day the only apps we were talking about was bruschetta and cheese puffs. [everyone laughs] Well, I'll never understand this. I... I... I just don't. I don't understand all this. No, how could you understand it mom, you've never asked me about it. Molly, seriously. It's time to just let go of this project and come back to Hoffman. Veronica not now. We're supposed to be celebrating. She needs to hear this. It's just too risky to go out on her own like this. Yeah well, I'd rather take a shot than risk being an accountant. And what is wrong with being an accountant? Nothing. Look mom, it's perfect for you, okay? And, it's just, I don't have a passion for it. And, mom I'm sorry if that messes up your big life plan, but it's my life that you're planning. Molly your Mother just wants you to be mindful about the future. No, she wants to control my future. Okay. Why don't we open more gifts? I'm so sorry, I need to get some air. I'm, I'm sorry. Oh, dad, so about this... Jeffrey. I apologize for the dramatics. She'll calm down. Mrs. Hoffman, don't you see what an incredible woman she is? Of course I do. She is just not acting with any sense. All she wants is to create her own success. Make you proud. Young man I don't think I need an education on my own daughter. Forgive me, I disagree. She is thoughtful, dedicated, intelligent. She's even funny. When you give her the chance. And maybe you don't appreciate her. But I do. Well congratulations, you've officially survived a Hoffman family dinner. [laughs] But I still haven't fulfilled my promise of giving you a fun evening. Shall we, m'lady? What? Oh, I insist. After you. Thank you. It's like your drawing. Ah. Alright. So tell me about this Evan character. Why did you guys breakup? Is he even clutzier than you are? [laughs] We both know that's not possible. No, he was a nice guy. I just, I think, the future he envisioned only included his dreams. He never really supported mine. And then? And then we graduated and parted ways. I guess as far as breakups go, it was pretty painless. Maybe your heart just wasn't in it. Yeah. Probably right. That, and I promised myself that I would never lose sight of my ambition because I got distracted by a boyfriend. So that's why you use Mingle All the Way. You keep guys at arms-length. Yeah, sure, okay. Well, it takes two to mingle. What's your story? How much you bet me to take the reins right now? What? We could be half way to Canada with me at the helm. You are a menace to society. Those Angelenos aren't going to know what hit 'em. Well, this menace is going to be on your arm at all the extra events we've added to the schedule. Hmm.

Molly and I look forward to it. She is a real keeper, Jeffrey. And I have to say, I've noticed a real change in you lately. I can't remember the last time I've seen you so engaged. [text alert] Lisa! Hey! Hi Tyler. Is Molly around? No, she's uh, out running some errands. What's up? I had a meeting nearby and thought she might be free for last minute lunch. Right. Well, I'd, I'd, I'd be happy to join you instead... If you like. That sounds awesome. Great. ♪ [knocking] Jeff Scanlon, reporting for elf duty. Oh. Surprised you didn't arrive here on Santa's sleigh. Don't be absurd. Santa is in the North Pole, finalizing his naughty and nice list. Oh, what are the chances I made that list? I regret to inform you, I've seen that list, you are on probation on the naughty side. What! But these might earn you some points towards an upgrade. I also made you a Christmas movie curriculum, so... Wow, a whole curriculum. I'm nervous. Come in. This place is very Molly-esque. Disciplined. With a hint of subtle whimsy, just dying to get out. I thought we can start with dinner and then get to the tree. You're the boss. What's on the menu? Well, I have prepared my signature dish, take-out pizza, a la Molly. Oh no. Not on my watch. Kitchen... this way? Mhmm. Um. I'm not exactly gifted in the culinary arts. Yeah. I think I gathered that. Uh, I can work with this. This is good. Oh you... you bake and you cook? Well, not so much anymore. Not quite as much fun cooking for one. Oh. Yeah, that's... I feel that way every time I get take out, you know. I always have leftovers. So what happened with you and Ashley anyway. Oh, well we were together two years. I started looking at rings. I thought that's where we were headed. And then? One day she told me she didn't see marriage in our cards. At first I wasn't ambitious enough and then when I followed her advice and pursued the corporate track she said I didn't have enough time for her which is pretty ironic, huh? Yeah. Sorry. The breakup was a shock. I'm over it now but sometimes I do miss having that person around who always had my back. Yeah, I don't... I don't think I've ever had that. My compliments to the Jeff. [chuckles] Now it's time to make like a tree. And leave? And leave. I think you mean decorate the tree, right? Yeah, right. [laughs] Okay. [chuckles] Wow. You bought me all these ornaments? No, I did not buy these. These are from my personal stash. I have been collecting these for years. Along with snow globes. I get a new one in every city I visit. You are one of a kind, sir. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. It's lame for a grown man to love snow globes. Thinking it, yes, but I wasn't going to say it out loud. There is nothing wrong with lame hobbies because I, for one, belong to a knitting club. [laughs] It's true. My mom gave me my first snow globe when I was a kid. Keeping the tradition helps me remember her. I guess that's part of the reason I love tseason so much. My family always made it feel so special. That's really sweet. What about Erika and Riley, aren't they going to miss you when you move to L.A? I'm sure they will. Let's circle back to this whole knitting club- [crash] My knight in shining tinsel. That was a... was a close one. Yeah. Close one. [knocking] Hello? Mom? Is this a good time to talk? Yeah, hey. What are you doing here? Came to see my daughter's office. Oh. It's very charming. Are you making fun of me? No! I'm not. I'm sorry. Your, your Jeffrey gave me a good dressing down about my attitude and... Well, I hope he didn't offend you. He's just, he's very encouraging about my project. Well, I'm glad. It's high time I came to see what Mingle All the Way was all about. [laughs] Wow. You just said "Mingle All the Way" without gagging. Well, Michelle showed me how it works and it's very professional, it really is. Well, we're still hoping for a bigger launch, but, we try. Molly, I have no doubt that you are going to be a success at whatever you choose to do. And I'm proud of you. You have a funny way of showing it. I wanted to push you because I didn't think you were thinking things through, striking out on your own like that. But obviously I was wrong. But you're never hard on Michelle. Michelle is a very different person. She needs constant validation but you've always been so confident. I just knew you could take more pressure. [sighs] Well, to be honest mom, I just act confidently around you because I'm trying to impress you. Did it ever occur to you that I wanted you to come back to work with me because I just like having you around? Listen, daddy and I had a talk and we've decided this is our last year in Aspen. We'd like to start having Christmas as a family again. With all the old traditions. Yeah, I... I would like that a lot. And I know you two have your Father-Daughter time together, and I was thinking maybe you and I could maybe start our own one-on-one... Thing? Activity... thing? Yeah, that would be fantastic, mom.

Your face never lit up when you talked about Ashley the way it does when you talk about Molly. Are you sure that Ashley broke your heart? I mean isn't it possible she just wounded your pride?

No. Let's go. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? I was just, uh, was looking for... water, or... Mhmm. I know Ashley Brock and she doesn't hold a candle to you.

We barely know anything about her. Uh, she's a tech entrepreneur. Her scheduling app is currently being uh, capitalized by Lange Enterprises. Scheduling? That's an interesting way to describe Mingle All the Way. Mingle what? Oh, it's a tool that very busy guys like Jeff use to rustle up a girlfriend. Brent what are you driving at? It's very fascinating sir, in fact I was just reading Molly's, uh, founder's testimonial on the Mingle All the Way website- What? Brent. Uh, here we go. "This Christmas, it's networking success one, "dating anxiety zero" Please don't. "I am Molly Hoffman, "creator of Mingle All the Way and a proud member. "My match Jeff and I have compatible schedules "and interests and a mutual gain in accompanying each other "to our seasonal events." Can I see that? Yeah. "We aren't looking for romance and that's totally okay. "Helping each other navigate the holiday season was "the entire point of our successful mingling experience." This was posted today? So, this was all for show, Jeffrey? This is, uh, extremely disappointing. Yes sir, it certainly is. I should go. So, you were just using me? We were both using each other. That's what we agreed to. Maybe. But I thought we developed a real connection. Jeff, we've been lying to Mr. Grayson all along. Yeah. But I never lied to you. Good luck with your presentation, Molly. [phone ringing] Hello, darling. Merry Christmas. Daddy and I are having a wonderful- Mom. I messed everything up. What do you mean? Is it about the app? 'Cause if Helen Lange isn't coming through with that investment, honey, we can talk about- No. It's not that. It's Jeff. Listen mom, I've been lying to you about our relationship and you don't deserve that. Merry Christmas, kiddo. Wow! Look at that doll! Thanks Uncle Jeff. I love her! Molly helped me choose everything. Well, Riley you're going to have to make sure that you call Molly to thank her. That won't be necessary. You're in a mood. Aren't you going to some big gala with her later? Not anymore.

Mr. Grayson, I am so sorry. Well, that stunt that Brent performed was despicable. A true Grayson teammate doesn't spite his colleagues in that manner. Believe you me, Brent and I had some words. Everything he said was true. I haven't been honest with you, sir and it's time I stopped pretending. Jeffrey, I know a man in love when I see it. And I'm not so sure you were pretending at all. Look, you don't need a girlfriend to prove to me you know how to commit. I just needed to be certain that you were dedicated to an executive role. And if you're willing to work this hard just for the position, well then, you've got me convinced. The L.A. office is yours. If you want it. ♪ Okay, if she turns around I'm going to have to say something, so, what should I say? Talk about the food. What about the food? The hors d'oeuvres are delicious. That's great. I'll use that. That's great. Where is she? Hey, uh, where have you been? We've been waiting. Cut her some slack. Don't worry about being late you're right on time. Jeff isn't coming. I ruined everything. What... what happened? He read my testimonial and found out the truth. He hates me now. Molly, I'm sorry. I... I wasn't thinking. No, it wasn't your fault. I just, I don't know what I'm going to say to Mrs. Lange. I... She is going to think I'm a failure. You know, forget about her for a second. Yeah. How are you? What, no, it doesn't matter I just, I can't face her yet, I, I... what am I supposed to say? I can't face her until I know what to do. Okay, come on. Listen to me, you are Molly Hoffman- Creator of Mingle All the Way. You've got this. Wish me luck. Excuse me for a moment. Molly! I have been trying to have a word with you all night long. So where is your match that I've heard so very much about? Well, the truth is Mrs. Lange, the truth is- The truth is, I was running late. Jeff Scanlon. It is a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Lange. Likewise. I know you're considering an investment in Mingle All the Way, but I think you should stop considering it. Oh? I can't think of a better idea. I know I don't regret signing up for it. So you feel that your match with Ms. Hoffman was a success, in spite of your reluctance to have a relationship? Meeting Molly was the most successful thing to happen to me all year. It taught me about the kind of woman I should be with. Do I detect something between the two of you? Something more than a functional arrangement? No. We used Mingle All the Way exactly as it was intended. There was never- Yes, Mrs. Lange. There is. I'm sorry for misleading you, but I've developed real feelings for Jeff. Ma'am. Sorry, there is someone you really need to meet. Oh, I'll be right there Connor. Thank you. I'm sorry. Will you excuse me a moment? I'm sorry I kept you waiting. It was worth the wait. So what happened with Mr. Grayson? Was he angry? Yes, he was. But, at Brent. He offered me the promotion. Wow! That's... that's great! Congratulations- I didn't take it. I don't need L.A. to be happy. Everything I need to be happy is right here. I don't want to be that far away from Riley. Or from you. So, what are you going to do instead? I told Mr. Grayson that I want to get back to designing and he is going to let me oversee the department. I am staying right here in Cedar Falls. [laughs] That is fantastic! So? Hey. Sorry to interrupt. What did she say? Oh, I...I haven't heard yet. Molly, I've put some thought into it and I think that the concept for your app is... Sensational! And it's even better when you get something more out of the experience than you expected. It is? That's great! So I am very proud to say welcome to the Lange Enterprises Family. Thank you so much! Way to go Molly! Well, shall we go celebrate with a toast. We shall. Merry Christmas, Molly. Merry Christmas, Jeff. And just to be honest, I have completely fallen for you. That is good to hear, Molly Hoffman. Because as it stands, I feel the same way. ♪ Spill all your emotions on the table. ♪ ♪ and let me see your heart upon your sleeve. ♪ So how about we go on a proper first date? Thought you'd never ask. What are you doing for New Years? Well, let me check my schedule. [laughs] Stop. ♪ So all you want for Christmas ♪ ♪ Ohhh, ohh, ♪ ♪ Is me.
