Did you sleep well, buddy? I was dreaming about reindeers. I thought I'd take someone from Helsinki to have company, but you fell asleep when you got in the car. Hey, we'll be in Gdańsk soon. Gdańsk? Gdańsk. Gdańsk. Gdańsk. What got you up so early? It's Sunday! Santa's coming! Really? So, are you going to the Motława? I have to stand at the front, so that Santa sees me and takes my letter. Will you come with us, please? I'm afraid I have to go to work. On a Sunday!? Well, you see, Lena, daddy did a few Sundays on Mondays, so now it's my Monday on a Sunday. Got it? Too bad. - Morning, Dad. - How are you, Krysia? - I'm on my way out. - I'm just calling to ask... if you could come as Santa today to see Borys... No, out of the question. You know I don't do favors. You shouldn't expect me to. Grandson or not. I won't lower myself to that. Even for family. You'd just have to take his letter, pat him on the head and give him some fudge, that's all. We'll be standing at the front. You're his grandpa. Great-grandpa sitting on a sled, Grandpa just shitting in his bed I might be grandpa for you, but not for millions of others. For them, I'm King Lear, Macbeth... But today you're Santa, right? The Bishop of Mira, if anything. Don't bother me now. This might be the last year that Borys believes in Santa. He's having a hard time now. You should have thought about that before you left your husband. And now that the child's emotionally damaged, you're calling grandpa for help. Borys needs a specialist, not Santa Claus. - Monster. - What? Stupid old man... Son, what are you doing? Nice reindeers don't use make-up. Hurry up. Yes, yes. Mr August Szwarc has just arrived. The extras will be here soon. Ok, tell Jurek to relax. We're starting in 15 minutes. - Ok! In 10! - I'm here. It's an honor to work with you. This role's already gone down in history. There are no naughty children here? Don't make me take my rod out, unless you want a ho, ho, ho! Beating children isn't allowed now - sorry. I forgot to introduce myself, Magdalena Rudzińska, I'll see to it that you have perfect conditions for work. Where's my guard? Where are the reindeers, angels, fanfare? They'll be here soon. Can I just ask for a hot black coffee? In this mug. No milk. Daniel? Are you the new intern? Yes, I was just about to call you. We have a small delay, but we're on the way. Where are the goddam angels? They're here, yes. Got to go. Angels, reindeers, this way! Gentlemen, please get in, or I'll be fired before I start. Please just leave that star. Off we go. And you, sir? After you. Mom, I can't talk now. I'll call you later. Please step into the patrol car. Reindeer, snowflakes, good. Mom, Apsik has peed in my slippers again. Geez, we have to change the sand in his tray. Maybe I'll go with you? And what about work? It is Sunday, after all. And if they fire you, you'll have only Sundays. Have we got any mineral water? No, drink from the tap. We're not buying plastic bottles any more. We're saving money and being eco-friendly. What day is it today? Sunday. Ah, Sunday. Sunday... scrambled eggs on tomato. Right, I forgot! Quickly, please. Over there, reindeers... Come on, keep going. Let's go. Shake a leg, snowflakes... it's Daniel, right? You're half an hour late! "Daniel" - you said it beautifully. - How old are you? - How old would you like me to be? I'd like you to do your job on time. Hello, production manager, hello! Magda, are you there?! Hello! Stupid girl. Mr. August, what can I do for you? Where's my coffee? Get a cup of coffee for Szwarc. In his special mug. And take it to the ship. That's not everything! What kind of costume is this? Don't you know my size? Hello? Hello? They dressed me up like a bat. Shit! What am I doing here? A poor, helpless and despised old man... I love you so much. - Hail. - Hail. - Hail! - Hail! You couldn't make it any later? Get to work. That's what I'm doing. Hurry! I'm going to miss Santa because of you. Hello children! Until Santa Claus arrives, to stop us from freezing, let's all jump... - Are you happy? - Yes, very. Krysia! Krysia! Come here, we saved you a place. Hi. Hi. Look at those goons. - Probably here for Grunwald. - Are we having a great time? Hooray! That's right! Wave those flags... Get ready, we're going live now. Jola, I'll count you in: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. And you're live. And here we are live. The whole country is watching, so let's give our visitors from the home of the reindeer a big warm welcome! Faster, we don't have time! We're setting sail soon! Faster! Where are the other snowflakes?! Where are the reindeers?! This is a major event! Please... Mr. Szwarc? Santa? Santa? Hello, Mr. Szwarc...? Fuck! Mr. August, the make-up artist will come soon. Please get some rest now. What do you mean he's dead? Are you kidding me? There are millions of children here. Ania, don't panic, I'll think of something! The ship will sail, even if it kills me... Where are you taking those baubles?! Excuse me. I have a question. What do you mean, dead? Is this a joke? We have a live broadcast all over Poland. Do you get the situation, or should I do you a drawing? Blame Szwarc - he died, not me. That's the problem, my dear. So, what will we do? - Just knock it on the head. - But Magda said... Magda?! All I want to hear is you've got a Santa. Dead or alive! Get it done! Don't talk to me now - I'm working. Right. So? Remember I arranged it, so I'm creative and resourceful. Will you take the Santa job or not? I don't know... So, what's it to be? But no sucking up to kids or patting their heads... Ok, let's do it. Let's go. Jurek, we've got a Santa Claus. Full ahead! And me! LOVE IS ALL A warm welcome to our guests of honor: footballing superstar and national treasure... Here he is, Zbyszek Grunwald! Hip Hip! Hooray! Once again, we invite everyone here today... Zbyszek, Zbyszek! Ladies and gentlemen, let us remind you that this year Santa has come to Gdańsk at the invitation of Zbyszek Grunwald, who also funded the latest MRI laboratory... Eat something. Are you hungry? You want a sandwich? No, thanks. Or a tangerine? No, thank you, really. Our Zbyszek has conquered the hearts of women all around the world. It won't be an indiscretion if I say that he's just broken up with supermodel Rita Gonzalo, creating something of a scandal by leaving her for Melanie Rottschafer, the Vogue photographer. But ladies of Gdańsk, I have some good news for you, because Zbyszek is now back on the market. I've just been told that he's coming now... Maybe you could smile a little? The children like it. Hello, Santa! Ahoy! Ahoy! So, will you all help me welcome Santa?! Yes! Your phone's ringing. Hello? Yes, this is Krystyna Szwarc-Ponińska. He's coming! Santa Claus is arriving! Lena! Lena, wait for me! We'll catch you up. Who? Let's show him how long we've been waiting for him. - Please don't push on the barriers. - Lena! What is it? Grandpa's dead. - We're going to your father. - But mom, Santa! You'll see him on TV. Come on. Lena! He's here! He's finally arrived! Every child's best friend - Santa Claus! Let's all wave to him! Hooray for Santa! What is it? Wave, mister, wave. Hey, Jurek... - Jurek, do you see that? - Yes, what is it? Should we show it? It can't go out! It has to go out! Camera one. - Zoom in. - Geez! Got it. Prepare camera two for the reaction... And when he grabs her... On two. Great. I need Santa now. There's Santa. That's great. I apologize for the short break. I was lost for words. You won't have seen it, but we just witnessed a real miracle. Now what? My daughter... Sure, your grandma, wife, mother - who hasn't it been yet? If you go, don't come back! You're fired! That's good. Good morning. It's Christmas. Good morning. Good morning. - But Miss Roma, you didn't have to. - I did. What would we do without you? - Ah, so not long now. - Yes. - Any nerves? - A few. Excuse me. Yes? Yes, that's my fiance. Where? What power plant? Hi Dominik. Dominik, are you there? - Hi dad. - Hi son. - What took you so long? - You've got keys... I don't live here anymore... But you could use your keys. I'd rather not come unannounced. What's wrong now? Nothing. And what's that, lipstick? Did Mom put it on? No, I did. - Could you take Borys for a few days? - But we agreed next weekend. - I know, but... - No. - No? - No, I'm very busy. What's keeping you so busy? Listen, if you have a date, just say so. It doesn't bother me anymore. I don't have a date. I'm going to therapy. That doesn't bother me either. I've got an empty fridge, a bust radiator, and a presentation tomorrow. And cut the questions. You left me, remember... My father's dead. Really? And who's that? - That's not him. - No? He's very similar... Everyone looks alike in a wig, mustache and beard... His heart gave out this morning. That's terrible... You know what, just don't cry for him. You hated him. It was mutual. Right... it all falls on me, as usual. I have to arrange the funeral, choose a coffin, food for the wake, flowers. And I need to sort out all his damn things... - Alright. - And call the whole family... And all his actor friends. alright. I'll take care of our son. Ah! Thanks. Mr. Jan, maybe you'd like to dry out a bit more? It's not over yet? There's a walk along Długi Targ. You need to get changed. Congratulations, great dive. You have to give fudge to the children. I said no sucking up to the children! But you don't have to suck up to them. It'll be fine. - Why did he throw them away? - Is that in the script? Santa! Santa! What's going on over there? There was some clown there. Camera two. Radek, find the clown... Zoom in on the clown. The clown. There's the clown. Now all cameras on Zbyszek. - Three, four, five... - On Zbyszek? - Hail. - Hail! What happened? - Nothing. - Sure, I can see that. You'll look great at the wedding. These are my... I'm Voymir, I mean Stefan. - And this is my sister. - Sylwia. Rzepicha. Sigurd. Mateusz on my ID. Piotrek - God's Wrath to his friends... Now I'm scared. - And this is my... - Romus... I mean Roma. Krzysiek's fiance... Are you sure you feel ok? - Yes. - Come on. Romus, I'm ok. Come on. Come on, sit down. Leave it now, please. Ok, what happened? Mstivoy, I mean Krzysiek, got a bit carried away... Mstivoy? A-ha. And? He headbutted the baron and almost stabbed the elf to death. My Krzysiek? But that's impossible. He's yours, so take care of him. Because he's in a really bad way now. Maybe you can't see it, but we've known Krzysiek for ages. He's not himself. - Hail. - Hail! Krzysiek, bye. Krzysiek? Yes? What's going on? So they told you? - That you attacked some baron. - Sometimes you have to. It's everything at once. Maybe it's too much for you? What's too much? Your mother died recently, we're getting married soon. Let's put it off, really. Everything's ok, Romus. It's ok. No, no, no, stop. Don't do this to me... No, no, no... Stop! Stop! Where are you going, you jackass! Sorry, it's where they told me to go. Wanda. How do you know my... Ah, the tag... Silly me, I forgot. Where's the horse guy? The driver. Mr. Coachman! - May I? - I can manage. Sorry, sorry... Oh bugger... Sorry... - Maybe like this... - Ok. Will someone unwrap this gift tonight? Huh? Ah! No. No? Unfortunately, I'll have to do it myself. But I'll gladly help... I know. I hope you're qualified. For cutting ribbons and things... We have to go. Yes, in a minute. Right... I'll be off. So long. My little one, thank God... - Thank God! - What are you doing here? I saw what happened, I was on the crane, but I saw it on TV. Why didn't you call? I thought Smardzewski wouldn't let you go... Are you crazy!? My daughter. She almost drowned. You see, I told you Smardzewski was a good guy. Today at noon Zbigniew Grunwald, our biggest football star, was the main sponsor at the celebrations... Romus... Zbyszek showed up on Długi Targ and literally stole Santa's show. It's your sister, I think. Or rather, Santa lost with a walk-over - as he fled from the festival. Zbyszek then stepped in... This is a nightmare. - Can you see it's me? - Of course. I'm snorting, aren't I? You're laughing, from the heart. What a crappy day. Did you get his number? Yeah, right. And let him think I want to sleep with him? And that would be terrible. Can we change the subject? I just don't get you any more. Roma, I don't understand myself. When was the last time you slept with someone? Listen, I'm not you. You're open, you make friends easily, and in general you're cool. You'll always find a man... Fortunately, I don't have to. You know what... if you meet someone who you fancy and he looks at you that way... Just say, "Hi, I'm Roma... ...Wanda. I like you." Is she snorting? Yes, especially as a box with a bow on top. So you like him? Piss off. And I'll never call you again! No, I won't meet the sponsors today. No, not today. Is Wanda Orzechowska, the sales woman from Artus mall, - going to be his next trophy? - Hold on. Coming. Gentlemen, I wanted to call you, but the parade didn't give me a chance. Alright. Hi. It's great you're here. Man, the moment he goes out, all those girls will be jumping on him. - How long are you staying here? - A few days. Who wants beer? Ok, talk. Did you set it all up yourself? Huh? Right, he killed Szwarc and pushed the child into the water. And now he's funding hospitals. Ok, so? Are we hitting the town? Yes, time to go crazy! Here. And hey, why did you split from that Brazilian, that Melania? - Who's the girl with the bow? - To the girl from the mall: - even desperation has its limits. - She's nobody. Look out, girl. - Watch out for the predator! - How old are you, man? Excuse me, Santa Claus! You've finally arrived. I recognized you immediately. What is it, Santa? Hungry? Shish kebab, hamburger, fries, salad. Everything's still warm. Will you join me? This way. He saves the child and then flees. He doesn't even look at Grunwald. That's sensational and... puzzling. In addition, this tearful little girl. Let's milk this cow until it's empty. Hi, Magda, great to see you. - Sit with us. - No, no. Thanks. Come on. Sorry. Actually, it was all thanks to Magda. Don't exaggerate. But there's still the little problem that he has disappeared. And that's bad. We must have him for tomorrow. Magda, you have to find that guy, dig him up for us. I'll try, boss. A huge loss for Polish theater. An acting giant. Sleep well, my saint. I'm not a saint. I won't tell anyone. I'm famous. - Yes, you're a famous dope! Eat. - Antek, don't play with your mug. You'll spill it again. - Here you are. - What's this? What do you mean? Sandwiches for work. Ah, yes. Thank you. I saw you on TV yesterday. Good advertising for us. - Piss off. - Right. It's always just "piss off" with you. Be a little more cultured, Wanda. You're not just representing yourself. And control your vocabulary a little, my ears are burning. Piss off. Not to mention you're wearing brown again. - Piss... - I'm begging you, don't finish it, you're not suited to working with people or in a team. Your attitude is simply distasteful, in general. Piss off! And fix your face. Wanda, it's not Halloween. Jesus! Oh, the eternal virgin Mary. Excuse me. Excuse me. Oh my... - That's him. - Geez, it's Grunwald. They don't make men like that anymore. Zbyszek... Mr. Zbyszek, welcome. Mr. Zbyszek, please step inside. And you - wait. - Why?! Why?! - It's not 9 a.m. yet. We'll open soon. Please wait. I'm so sorry. I didn't recognize, but my exhausted mind's playing tricks on me, you see. The cannibals will soon smash the door down. But please come back after we close, and you can buy everything in peace, with dignity, without those crazed groupies. You're more than welcome. I'm looking for Wanda. Wanda Orzechowska. Of course. Miss Wanda is in the toilet, we'll tell her right away. Get lost. I'm looking for him, but he's not looking for me. Yes, since dawn. Yes, yes. Great advice, I'll look around. I said I'd find him, and I will. Stop following me all the time. I won't let a saint wander alone. You have to know your way around. "Piss off"? That's a direct quote. Uh-huh. Wanda? I know you're here. I'm coming in. - Wanda? - Think, think, think... Wanda...? Wanda? Occupied! I'm sorry to bother you at work and... here... Look, I have an important meeting with sponsors but I have to tell you something... Wanda... I know it sounds ridiculous, the whole situation is idiotic, but yesterday when I saw you... Could you come out here? Please, for a moment. It would be easier for me. Go to your precious sponsors. I'm not coming out of anywhere, don't count on anything. Goodbye. Pardon? You think you can just fuck me and go, right? Oh no, I respect myself. Poor people have their dignity too, you know? Why? You think that's how I wanted to play it? You always play it like that. You really think that if you sponsor Santa this year, then all the girls will be yours?! A good body and a pretty face is not all! What would you know?! Well. Well done, idiot. So, Mr. Zbyszek? Success? Like hell. Thank you. Oh, I almost forgot. Because, you know, we have a casting for Santa today. I'm sorry, but we have to open up. You know, I have a friend called Zbyszek. After Zbyszek Boniek. And your calves are like... I'm sorry, but I'd love to get my claws into them. Just between you and me, do you shave them? And I saw recently your charity sack race in Brazil, at the orphanage. - I do what I can. - It was a wonderful sight. I watch it sometimes in slow-motion to unwind. Excuse me! There's a shoe sale, 70 % off, on the first floor, ladies. Please go to the first floor. For the Santa casting? Zbyszek, my golden boy. Run, run. We both have millions of things to do. You're all here for the casting, right? You come with me, and the others - thank you. Follow me, sir. I last saw your father in "King Lear". A great role. But he most liked to play Santa Claus. He hated children, but then he had his biggest audience. He liked the applause and himself most, I think. Sorry. Should I be crying? No, no. Everyone's entitled to mourn in their own way. And are your parents still alive? No. I mean, I only know about my mother, because I buried her myself. My father left us when I was three years old. In fact, I don't even know what it means to have a father. Right. Let's move on to the nicer part: selection of the coffin. Lena's coming! Was it cold? Some chocolate for you, miss. To celebrate Santa saving my life! Thank you, sweetie. You were very brave. - And the rolls for your art class. - Oh, so many! Thank you. They'll come in handy for the crib. Oh, Miss Sandra, a very important thing. Krystyna Szwarc needs some time off. You know, her father's died. Someone has to make her paper chain and gingerbread. If Ms Krystyna needs a favor, she can come in person. Right, right... But considering that Krysia - how to put this - hates you, it'd be better if we settled it. After all, it was you who screwed her husband. So I've prepared a new schedule. I'll get somebody to do the chain. And if Krysia comes back, we'll decorate the classroom and stuff. And if not, then the Christmas tree alone will do. You're not human... you know that? The bell. The bell. This is the Extravagant Oak casket. If not, I recommend the Kashubian Classic. Please, go ahead... - Hello? - Dominik? Yes, Krysia, it's me. I just wanted to say that I took Borys to school. Hallelujah! - And? - Well, I wanted to ask how you feel? Great. I'm just choosing the coffin for my father. - Oh, so I won't bother you now... - Bye. Bye. Good morning, Mr. Smardzewski. Good morning, how's work? How are things? It's me, Ewa Szajnocha. Oh, I don't believe it, you don't recognize me. Tadek's wife. I came for some sand for the cat, the rascal peed into the slippers again. Tadek promised to bring it himself, but I'll probably wait forever... The sand is here. Help yourself. Thank you very much. Take these too. Oh, it's us. What happened? Mrs. Ola... Ewa... Tadeusz doesn't work here anymore. What do you mean? He crossed the line, as we say in the yard. I understand, of course. The sponsors again. They want to know if you'll come. - Can I ask you something? - Just a moment, ok? What's going on? Do you think I'm... What? Never mind. Sir, we're coming straight to your office. No, we're not. Change of plan. - But... - change of plan. Jesus loves me. Good morning, remember me? I'm Magda, we met on the show. - You have my things. - Yes, of course. - Where did you sleep? - My place, where else? We had kebabs, burgers, fries. But we can arrange you a hotel. Oh, that would be great. My place has a terrible draft. I'm not talking to you. You can't help it. You're the new Santa. "New"? There's only one Santa. I'm not Santa Claus, Eddie! Vladek! My name is Vladek! Ok, I don't want to disturb you, I'm sure you have other plans. Good luck and goodbye. But it's a pity, because they pay really well. What do you mean, pay? Well, did you think that old Szwarc did it for free? He must have made twenty grand a day. Room 205. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's a great honor to host Santa Claus. Yes? Santa, did you really come here from Finland? Yes, but Santa Claus was from Turkey. You're such a fibber, sir. So long. So? Do I get the job? Nobody will do it better. Well, at last someone with initiative! Nice creaking boots. Cowhide, I can smell it from here. Now that's Santa! I can see at once that you must have a large sack. Give it back! Give me back the beard! Give back the beard! What an embarrassment. It really is. That deadbeat will traumatize the kids He was a bad choice. Sir, I'm very motivated - and not afraid of challenges. - Ok, let's have a voice test. Why don't you say this: Choo-choo-choo, present-shmesent, and so on. Ho, ho, hoo! Pardon? You know, the little bullshit you'll have to say to the kids. Uh-huh. Janek, Wanda, ho, ho, ho... Ok, I can see it. But... I need to see that you like kids, that you'll do everything for them. Put a child on your lap now. What child? Well, me. We're all children, right? That's it, we've got it! It didn't hurt, did it? Thanks very much. - And? Did I get the job? - Yes. Thanks very much. I'm sorry, sir. Sir... You're fired. And don't ask me any questions. - Hi, sweetie. - Hi. Tired? We're doing the August Szwarc funeral. Wow, congratulations. I always knew you'd go far. Look, there's a problem... My mother was upset. Upset? So I gave in and she'll sing "Hakuna Matata" from "Lion King", after all. Yes? And don't be surprised, Uncle Mietek will play the piano for her. Who's Uncle Mietek? You know him. He spilled borscht on you on Christmas Eve. But my mother has to sing before dad's speech. - It's pointless... - My dad's speech? Krzysiek, he really wants to. My sister will never get married. My dad may not get the chance again. But enough of the bad things. And just so you know, I've ordered carnations. Because there was a good offer. In that case, to the carnations. He lives with a group of elves in Lapland. A friend to all children, it's his custom to deliver gifts, he's famous for miracles and helping the poor and needy... Yes? Yes. Miracles and helping the poor and needy... The Bishop of Mira in present-day Turkey... You don't have to know everything about him. I think I should. But you know - it's never been proven... - What? - That Santa had a beard. Please give our wonderful guest a big hand. How was your trip through the northern snows? Fine, thank you. Tell us, Santa, how old are you now? Well, now he'd be... I'd have to count. But you know what, the date isn't certain. In general, little is known about him. Of course, you mean you, because you're him! No, I'm not him... What do you mean, not him? if I were him... We're sinking. Get the clip. Beata, we'll play the clip. Children, let's watch a clip of a rescue worthy of a saint. Santa! Santa Claus! Wonderful, Santa, we have a question... Be quiet! I can't hear what the lady is saying! Sorry, what did you say? - Easy. Let's talk about it all again... - How am I doing? No, you're doing great... just great... Save us, Beata. Are you feeling ok? - Please don't whisper, we're live... - She's good. Camera one... I'm only here as a stand-in. Santa had a really hard day yesterday. So hard that he died... Huh? He died, you see. From a heart attack. Yesterday morning. Don't worry, kids! Santa loves Christmas. And above all, Santa loves you. Say something nice, we can all see that you look like Santa. That's what they pay me for. What, money? And what did you think? - That the actor who keeled over... - Yes, honey... I mean 'hi'. Is Borys watching TV? - He got so much cash... - Yes, he is. Turn it off right now! Why? it's still early. - Because I say so! - That's right, dear children, there is no Santa Claus. It's all fake, a big scam. - He's just a paper cut-out saint. - But dad... Dad, no! Your mother said so. Come on, we'll play scrabble. In that case, let's all sing a carol now! - All together now. - Not me. Boss, we couldn't do much. What now? We have a hit. That guy is worth every cent. At the weekend, we'll also have the Santa Special Show. We'll wipe the floor with the competition. Good job. You have to offer him cash, a hotel, food, drink, lewd lady elves, whatever he wants! We need him! Of course. - Hello. - Hi. Come to dinner with us? I still have something to do. I'm sorry, may I? Come in. This is your fee. Thank you. So? They didn't really like it? - What? You were great! - But this isn't for me. I'm a forest technician, not a clown. I'm going home tomorrow. Then I'll take you to your hotel. That's great, thank you. "Today in Bethlehem there's merry news That the pure Maiden, Has borne a son Christ is born He'll save us The angels are playing music The kings are bidding welcome The shepherds are singing The cattle are kneeling Wonders, wonders do they announce." He died... But hey, don't worry. It'll be fine, girls. - Hello. - They were watching TV yesterday? Borys too? Yes. Until he said that Santa was fake and a "paper cut-out saint". Television lies! He's afraid that if Santa's fake, he won't get any presents. Give your dad a kiss. Go on, be brave. Borys' dad? Yes? A kiss for me too, please? Sandra, give me a break. As I recall, we were good together. And as I recall, I was married. Hey, Jan! Mr. Jan! You don't even know what you did yesterday. You're a star, people love you. You broke viewing records, you're better than Zbyszek Grunwald. That's good, isn't it? It doesn't matter now. You can make a lot of money and be a lumberjack for fun. I understand but no, thank you. So, what now? I want to visit someone before I leave. I'll give you a lift. - Call me Jan. - Magda. Good morning, Santa. We want the funeral before Christmas, only for the closest family. My husband was... an officer. He didn't like a fuss. I see. Dad wanted a simple casket and a birch cross. 'Not to suffocate under granite'... I understand. We will meet the wishes of the deceased. Shall we say eleven o'clock tomorrow for the funeral? Yes. Fine. But I won't be attending. It just so happens that tomorrow... I'm getting married. But I'll make sure it's all done with dignity and due care. Thank you. Cry, Mom, you can cry. Cry. We'll manage... Dad didn't like tears. I'm sorry. Ho, ho, ho, it's me, Mr Bear... Well? Isn't it too glittery? Has Krzysiek seen it? Kind of. You're arranging everything yourself, Romus? He hasn't been himself lately. I'm really trying to understand him, but I don't think I'm good at it. Romus, he spends his days among the dead, that's why. But he's everything to me, get it? Ho, ho, ho! - It's great that you have each other. - Wanda, get a grip on yourself. You're bound to meet someone. Relax, go out with friends, have some fun. You can't wait all your life for Prince Charming. Give him a chance to find you. Look sis, you're too pretty and young to be living alone. Without love or sex. - Yes? - I'm off for lunch. Congratulations! Thank you. And who's that? Santa, are you blind? He has great calves. Don't start... Yes? What are you doing? What do you mean? I'm at the shipyard... Sitting on the crane... working... - Why? - No, just... I was just calling. Ok, bye. Bye. Yes? Good morning. I'm looking for Tosia. Antonina Chmielewska. Mrs Chmielewska... is dead, unfortunately. We bought this apartment from her son... Was she someone close to you? I'm very sorry. He's resisting, but I know how to talk to him. Then I'll bring him to you. Yes, sure, already in costume. Yes... I'm leaving. Ok! I said "ok"! Bye. Sorry, what did you say? I said I'm going back to Finland. Has something happened? You wanted to fix things, but it was too late? In love, something always breaks, sooner or later. It's the happy times in between that matter. I just found out that my wife is dead. You were late for her, but you arrived on time for us. You're honest, direct and you don't pretend at all. Stay as Santa a little bit longer. For me. Please. And then you can go back to your forest. - Watch out! - Watch out yourself, idiot! Ho, ho, ho! Hi. Can I walk you home? I prefer to go by bus. I really like buses. - Don't you want a stroll with Santa? - No. But why? Because I'm angry, I live alone and don't have sex. My perfect woman. Every day I think it can't get worse and every day life surprises me. But at least you're pretty. Unlike you. But apart from that, I have only pluses. Like what? I'm good in bed. Z... Benek. Zbenek...? Zwanda. So? I warn you, I'm waiting for the one. Just like me. Just like everyone. But for now, we just have to get by. So, shall we go? Ho. Tadeusz! Three beers and a szarlotka! Two beers, and a vodka and apple juice. Just do something about this! Have you served that woman in red yet? What woman in red? She's been waiting ages for a rum and coke. Shit! The bigger the crowd, the calmer the bartender has to be. Yeah, right. Or just hand in your notice. You're good at that. Tadeusz? Hi! It's me. I'm... I went out with the boys for a beer. Ok, how late will you be? Well, once we get started... you know how the guys are... Oh, a-ha... Ok. Where's my cuba libre, cutie!? Have fun, bye. Wait, don't get in the shot. It's good you're here. Dammit, I love you! I'm here just for the money. See how honest he is. Amazing. - Wait. - The one and only... Santa Claus! Now. A special place for our special guest. - Please have a seat. - Camera three, wait for Dorota. Ho, ho, ho, ho. I'm Jan. Pardon? I'm Jan. Amanda, do you know our Ja... Santa Claus? I do. I think the whole of Poland knows him now, along with his controversial statements. It's hard to disagree with some of them. But have we really lost the real symbolic dimension of Christmas? Is that what you mean? Yes. Yes. The Christmas tables are overloaded with food, but nobody will invite a homeless person to join them. Never. Wait, you're referring to the beautiful Polish custom of keeping an empty place for a passing wanderer. Exactly, they're always empty. Empty. Because nobody will let the wanderer in. They'd rather call the police. Then it's back to the table and "Hush, baby Jesus" The joyful, family atmosphere. Scouring the floor, waxing the car, suffocating a live carp in a plastic bag... and drinking ourselves senseless. And all for the baby Jesus! Strong words. Is that how you see us Poles? Not only Poles. I don't like people in general. And most of all - myself. I hope there's an optimistic conclusion. Now, he'll have his say... Life is beautiful... No... ...But worth shit. - Yes! - Damn, he did it! That's all. See what's going on! Camera two... What a line! What a guy! Geez! - Please join us on Christmas Eve. - Hello? For the Santa Special Show. We hit 10 million viewers. He's better than the Pope. Keep going. Here. Ewa, are you sleeping? I'd love for you to be happy. - Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Zbyszek. Tired? It was a tough night, but I've given away all the presents. Wait a minute! Where are you... Wanda? Where did... - You be quiet! I'm speaking! - What? Tell me you just ran out to buy some warm bread. Don't touch me! - I didn't want... - What didn't you want!? You didn't want to screw me? - I did. - Exactly! But to say goodbye, to show you don't care, you didn't have the guts for that! - Huh, Santa Claus? - Look... The thing is... I think I got scared... Of me? Thanks. You have this effect on me. Whatever you do, your every move, every gesture. I've never felt this way before. I want to run away from you, but also never leave your side. Do you understand any of it? At that Santa Claus thing, did you know it then? Yes. Then why didn't you say anything? I don't know. I liked the fact you went to so much trouble. And I wanted to know how far you'd go. Oh, pretty far. That's good. So, shall we go to my room? Yes... No, I can't. It's my sister's wedding today. So when will I see you? - Sure you want to? - Yes. So tomorrow, I mean today, 8 p.m. And the wedding party? I'll get out of it somehow. Hi. Hi. Where are they all from?! Some mafia? I invited them all so no-one took offence. Hello. Hello. But there's over a hundred. Quiet! Hello. - How come they're here? - I knew you wouldn't invite them, and I wanted to make you happy. - But... - Because I love you, stupid. If Krzysztof hadn't started drowning, and Roma - as she told me - not given him mouth to mouth, we wouldn't all be here today. From today, Krzysztof and Roma will sail through life together. Saint Nicholas, patron saint of sailors, will watch over them. Krzysztof and Roma won't sink. Because they know that love is everything. A warm welcome to you all. Let's begin the wedding ceremony. Thank you. Are you ready to make a declaration of your intent - to get married...? - I can't. What? Krzysiek? Krzysiek? What's the matter? Roma? What's going on? "Or I shall live your epitaph to make, Or you survive when I in earth am rotten, From hence your memory death cannot take, Although in me each part will be forgotten." Thank you for coming. Krysia will be happy to see a familiar face. Do you think it was good I came? "The earth can yield me but a common grave," "When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie. Your monument shall be my gentle verse, Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read..." You took a day off today. Some important family matters, right? "When all the breathers of this world are dead; You still shall live, such virtue hath my pen, Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men." My father... August Szwarc was a father, grandfather, friend, artist... He played many roles in his life. Unfortunately, fate wouldn't let him leave in the spotlight, but alone in his dressing room, without his usual retinue. Father liked fudge very much... He always gave them away as Santa, and that's why I'd like to add some... But... But... this is not my father. Where is he? Probably in the other room, I don't know... I mean, I got water on the files and everything got smudged. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Wojnar... A most regrettable oversight... Gentlemen, please open it. Santa Claus. August Szwarc? Go and look in the other room. This way, please... Please... We'll take care of everything, please rest. I'm Daniel Wojnar. My mother asked me to go with you to the other room. Please make your way to Room 2. - We'll continue the ceremony there. - Sir... - Yes? - Could you serve the champagne now, my fellow artists don't know what to do with themselves. Actors! Spontaneous... Don't we love them for that? Please open it. He's so... peaceful. - Krysia... - You're here? I thought you'd need someone close. - Thanks. - And... and I'll look after our son for as long as needed. I mean, until you get back to... - Alright. - And... And if you feel lonely, you can always come to my place... I mean to ours, because it's still our home... No, it's not. It's not our home anymore. I have my home and you have yours. We live separately, completely separately, because we're not together anymore, we're separated. At least he's having a merry funeral, as most military ones are boring. This is Daniel Wojnar, Colonel Wojnar's son. I'll go and glue the paper chain. Excuse me. And I was dreading this day. But all in all, everything worked out fine, somehow. Oh, sorry. Tough day? I mixed up some corpses. It happens. I just laid flowers on my wife's grave. Today was my wedding. I ran away. Why? Don't you love her? I've never loved anyone so much. What's her name? Romus. That's nice. I don't mind gays. Look... if you love each other, what more do you need? And if I get left on my own? Dumped for someone else? Or if they die? Well, of course, sooner or later they'll leave or die. Everyone leaves or dies eventually. It's the moments of happiness in between that matter, before the lying and quarreling starts. You have to enjoy happiness, while it lasts. And you're too soft. Pull yourself together. And it's Christmas Eve as well. I don't want to talk to all those aunts... Screw that. We'll just tell our parents we're not coming, ok? But I've already got all the presents. Or a partridge, a pigeon... Hi, Krzysztof, it's Wanda here. Is Romus there? She's asleep. Can you just let her know... - that I'm staying at Stefan's? - "Stefan" who? The one with that sister, Sylwia bloody Rzepicha! - Hello? How could you?! - Romus, please. I don't have the strength. And I do? Look, I'm sorry. Really. I feel... really bad, stupid, sorry, I don't know... Give me some time. Two days. So I can think about everything, - get my head straight. - When are you coming home? When the time is right. What kind of line is that? Are you drunk? No, I just can't say it any other way. Understand, please. Have you slept with her?! Have you plowed her? - What?! - Plowed her. I know you understand! Wait till I get her! Just you wait... He turned our lives into a boot camp. He destroyed us. But now I can't help... but miss him. Don't be ashamed. Cry. Cry. Go ahead, cry it all out, it's what you need. Daniel? I want to make love to you. Now. Oh... Hold on. Zbyszek, it's Rafał's birthday. You have to come out. We're going to celebrate... I mean, we've already started. Are you coming with us? I'm busy tonight, guys. A transfer? Private stuff. A woman? You could say that. What time? If she loves you, she'll wait. And if you go with us, you won't regret it. You're passing up a drink with your buddies?! Are you dissing us? I don't have much time. - Come on. - That's more like it. I'll be late. I can't be late. Leave it out. Guys, I have to go now. - To Grunwald! - Greg, I really have to go. - Eat and then go. - Won't you drink with me? But I really have to go now. Zbyszek Grunwald, he's one of us... Guys! Zbyszek... What about your date? I'm going... Hi. Hi. Did I wake you up? No, I was getting up anyway. Daniel? Yes? How old are you? 18. Why? You have to go now. Why? Guess how old I am? - 45. - What?! Just kidding. You're crazy! What time is it? No idea. My son has his school nativity. I have to be there. So go. Go. Don't look at me like that! - Like what? - Like that. Like that? Like that. Couldn't Krysia come? I called her. She's bed-ridden. Oh, poor thing. And now this. Aren't you working today? Took a few hours off. Got to have time for the kids. We're all jealous of you guys. Why? Oh, come on! So many years together, and you're like newlyweds. Thank you once again. You were great. Merry Christmas. Goodbye. Where's your coat? Take care of your Ewa... Life can fall apart in no time. Mine went like that. - So... Merry Christmas. - You too. - Hello, how can I help you? - Can I see that necklace, please? How much is it? 586 zlotys, it comes with the box. - Beautiful. - Yes, timeless. Is there anything cheaper? Yes, of course. We have necklaces up to 100 zlotys. Ah, also timeless? Yes, of course. Can I see them, please? You can buy a set, and then it's... Really? Look at you, poor thing... I have to stay in bed. Good for you. Dominik told me. - Is that for me? - Chicken soup. Here. You have to eat. Even if it's the last thing on your mind. Ok. Hello. I'm Daniel. I'm Ewa Szajnocha. Aged 22... I mean... 35... I'll be going. The noodles... Thanks, Ewa. Wanda! Wanda? Wanda, wait! Oh... hi. Hi, how was it? How was the wedding? What? Ah, called off. - Oh! - Yeah. About last night... I was going to drop by... I wasn't sure. Did we arrange to meet? Yes, we did. But I didn't come, I'm sorry. Oh, that's good, 'cause I wasn't there. You weren't? It's better this way. It wouldn't work out for us anyway. Uh-huh. For sure. I'm looking for a prince on a white horse, that's not you. We're not right for each other. How can you know that? What? If people are right for each other? How can I know? If you can imagine a future together, you want to have kids together, you adore her even when she's breastfeeding and you'll always love her, and when you're eighty you'll still be able to laugh together... I believe that can happen. And when you kiss her, you feel like you're alone in the universe. Simple as that. That's my vision at least. And yours? Unfortunately, I'm just stupid. Right... Well. I'll be off then. Maybe we'll meet again someday, if not - then so long. And who are the flowers for? For... the victims... I mean, I was just walking to the monument... I wanted to pay my respects. Ah. Bye, then. Are they awake yet? No, still asleep. Happy name day, Ewa. Maybe put it under the Christmas tree? No, no, you'll like it. I love you. It's timeless. But we agreed not to give presents for our name days. Just something small under the tree. Alright, alright. - Don't you like it? - It's not that. I was just wondering where you got the money from since you got sacked from work. What? When? Last Sunday. Ok, Ewa... I was going to tell you... But you didn't! - Ewa! - Give me the receipt! - Why do you treat me like this? - The receipt for the necklace, now! - I don't have it. - Do I have to search you?! I stole it. What do you mean... you stole it? Just that, I stole the necklace. You'll return it. Now. Do you have anything else to say? No. Are you sure? Friday. Oatmeal. Please note that due to adverse weather conditions, all flights around Europe are delayed today. Mom! Mom! Hi Borys! Hello. - Is your father in? - No. Would you like something to drink? Water, please. I just popped round, to see what you're up to. So... water? Please. What are you watching? Nothing. Dad got drunk. I think you're exaggerating a little. He's going to therapy to get my mom back. I wouldn't worry about all that. Mom stopped eating, because she thinks that dad thinks she's old and fat. - Water. - Thank you. So what are we watching? - Maybe this? - Oh, definitely not! I know how you feel. Maybe you could come to me... I mean you could both come to me to make dumplings? On Christmas Eve. A lonely Christmas Eve is hell. We both know it well. Calm down! What's this supposed to be?! Turn it off. - I want to watch it! - Don't be childish! You're being childish. Turn it off. That's it. Go to your room! Now! Sorry about... it's ok, he's still young... Do you want me to go? I must be crazy. - You know it's Christmas Eve? - I know. If you don't like it, you can just run away. Come here. The ghost has come back. You finally remembered you have a home. Mother, this is Krysia. I think we've met before. We sit down to eat at six. Father would want it to be like always. What is it? Come on, I'll show you my room. Oh, shit. Just a moment, sorry. Ah, it's you. Good evening. Please leave it. There's no need. Aren't you the guy from the jewelry stand in Artus? Yes, that's me. Did she like the necklace? Unfortunately not. But don't worry, I'll give it back. I'll bring some more. Ok. I'm ashamed. Face to face with your mother. And when I go out, if I dare to go out, what will I say to her? Thank you, Daniel's mother, I had a great time. Ok, what do you want? I want to go back home. What for? Because it's Christmas Eve. And I want to spend it with my child. I miss him. - But I love you. - Yes, you love me. Very moving. Moving, but I really do love you. How many times do we fall in love? Several times. Once. Look, believe me, more than once. Maybe the first time is more intense, but... but later you know better what you want. Don't cry. I'm not crying. You are. Ok, I'm crying. I'm sorry. It's your father's. Wait here. Mom, where are we going? To look for dad. Mom, why are you pulling me? Let's go. And the gifts? You have to give more, and take more. Why are you crying, hmm? You're too pretty to be crying... Just bite the bullet and tidy yourself up a bit. Clear? Today's star is Santa Claus... - Give him a big hand. - That's right. The Santa Special Show, what a sell-out. Santa Special Show. I give you, straight from sunny Brazil, the Liza Paloma dance troupe, take it away! Hang on a moment. First the smoke, and then you go on. You know, Jan, I wanted to say it was really nice meeting you. Find something that will make you truly happy. But I like my job, despite all the stress. I'm not talking about work. I know. And now please welcome... And close-up. Five... - The one and only... - Ok. - You can do it. - Santa Claus! - Good luck. - Are you all ready? Let's start the countdown. Kids, come to me. - Let's all count down... - Zoom in. - Go. - Six, five... 4, 3, 2, 1... Again? Where is he? - Where is he? - Maybe something's happened? Tight on the host. Zoom in, please. - Improvise, Marek. - Jan! - Where's Jan... - Marek, go to the kids. - Don't show the armchair, Radek! - What should I show? Show the choir. Ok, there's a song. Let them sing. Now for a surprise. The "God's Children" school choir. Here we go! Today in Bethlehem there's merry news..." Welcome. Yes, darling. Love you too. I'll be back tomorrow. I can't talk now, bye. Sorry, that was my fiance. We'll be taking off soon. Stop! I knew you'd come back. We'll go to the North Pole, live together in an igloo, I'll feed the reindeer. Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself. Listen to me carefully, Vladek... Yes, Santa? I'll say it again. One last time. I'm not Santa Claus. I'm really not... Oh my, it's you. You're... Santa. No! I'm not! - But you're... - No, I'm not! - Dearest Santa... - it's not... - The one and only Santa... - it's not me! - A saint, but one who lies. - You saved my daughter. I'm so happy I can say thank you. That girl, it was your daughter? Yes. Our lovely Lena. And Antek. Gentlemen, it's Christmas Eve. My wife's name day... I'd like to invite you... Where's Borys? I bought a Christmas tree. Ewa, Ewa, come and see who I brought back. I'll get some beer. Go inside. Ewa... See what a gift I've brought. Ewa... Why are you sitting in the dark? Mom told us to sit quietly and watch TV. Where is she? In the closet. Make yourselves comfortable. Is that you? Ewa? Are you in there? Come out. Guess who's sitting in the living room? Ewa... I don't care who's where. I'm in the closet. I can see that. But why? Because I like it here. Honey, I'm begging you, please. What's this all about? Stop it! - Stop what? - Stop lying. I saw you! Do you love her? Geez... What the...? What did you see? - There's no-one but you. - There is. - So it's over, is it? - What's over? It's over between us! What? it'll never be over. Come here. Look at me. Sweetheart. It will never be over. I know I mess up sometimes, but I'd never do anything to hurt you. I love you. You're my little Ewa. I'm so tired sometimes. Come here. Easy, easy. You know, I can clean up sometimes, cook, and pick up the children. And do the shopping, if you write the list. And repair that puncture... I know I got lost lately, but... Don't say any more. - Hello, Lena? - Santa is with us. Are you sure it's him? Who else?! it's the real one! He's sitting in our living room and eating gingerbread. Call Zosia and Hela, I'll keep him talking. On my way, bye. I only want to know one thing. What? - Is that him? - Sure. On Christmas tables in Cameroon, they have roast monkey and beer. That's right, and in Latvia the festive tables feature piglet heads with bacon and groats. Americans eat turkey, while Belgians have wild boar... Can you see it? Holidays at work. Someone has to. And how are you? Well, it's nothing special. Aren't you cold? I am. Children around the city are disappearing. The police have had over thirty calls. They've spotted Santa Claus! - Good evening. May we? - Come in, please. He's in the room. Wipe your shoes! Put the flowers in the bathtub... Never, under any circumstances put the end of the saw on the tree trunk - it can bounce off spilling your guts on trees, like tinsel on a Christmas tree. Sometimes when I was felling trees, I saw things it's best not to know. - Tell us! Tell us... - I'll tell you one thing. In a forest, you have to be careful. Once my friend Kimi had his arms frozen to the saw, they were stiff from frost. And Mattie got caught by the wood chipper - it just clamped him, crunched him and that's the last we saw of him. Only his rubber boots were left. Did you catch that terrible Chipper? I did, and I gave him a real trashing. No, the chipper is a machine for crushing wood. - I'm never going to a forest again. - Me neither. Don't say that. It'd be a huge mistake, like from here to the north pole. Just be careful not to tread on a chopped-up woodcutter. I'd like to see it one day. Me too. When you grow a little, - and if I don't keel over... - Pan to the child. ...I'll invite you for the summer. Hooray! And zoom, Tomek. You can't deny that you're Santa now. It's not me, it's the kids. Anyway, what do I care? Will you be back next year? Not a chance. I hope that in a year I will again have my normal job in Finland. Won't you regret it? I never regret anything. Really? Well, maybe one thing. I wish I hadn't abandoned my own child. I have a son. I don't even know where he lives. He was three when I left. His mother didn't want to see me after that. And she was right. Santa Claus has a wife and child. Santa could have had a wife and child, if he hadn't been such an idiot. Will you tell us about your wife? She died. I was too late. - That's it. - Have you tried to find your son? No. Why not? What's his name? You haven't forgotten? You don't want to say? Krzysiek. Krzysztof. Chmielewski. He took his mother's surname. Krzysztof Chmielewski. This year, our hostess's name day party is anything but ordinary. - Here she is. - Good evening, my name's Ewa Szajnocha. Greetings to all Ewas! Merry Christmas! Thank you for your hospitality. Ah! And parents, you're welcome to pick up your kids. Na Piaskach Street in Gdańsk. There's tea and twelve dishes for all. Brave woman! This Christmas is unique. The children have found their real Santa Claus. Magda Rudzińska - reporting live for the "Santa Special Show". She did it. Hold on. Borys... I'm pregnant... What's this supposed to be? A knight on a white horse. Just like you wanted. Magda? I wondered what my father looked like my whole childhood. And what did you come up with? That he was like Mel Gibson in Braveheart... Oh, come on! Watch out! Are you ready for it? Yes. I love you. Will you marry me? I will. I'm Krzysztof.
