[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [THUNDER OF HOOVES] [PANTING] Naydia, what is it? They're... They're coming. NAKOMAY: No matter what happens you must stay close to me, do you understand? Look at me and tell me you understand! NAYDIA: Yes, I understand. It's time. We must leave now or it will be too late. Brother. I will protect you. [THUNDER OF HOOVES] [PANTING] [GUNSHOT] [GUN CLICK] [SIGHS] [GUN CLICK] [EMOTIONAL MUSIC] [DOOR SQUEAK] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [HEAVY BREATHING] Father. Benjamin. Come quickly! [INHALES SHARPLY] ETHEL: O gosh. - ETHEL: Father. Father. - BENJAMIN: Put pressure on it. THOMAS: She is losing a lot of blood and quickly! THOMAS: It's okay dear, you will be okay. ETHEL: It's going to be ok. THOMAS: She's gone. [WEEPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [NATURE SOUNDS] [DISTANT FOOTSTEPS] How is she? Faring well. She's exhausted, but that's to be expected. Have you her name, or anything? Not yet. I'll insist she stay with us when she wakes, don't you agree? I can't bear the thought of turning her away. I think it best. Lord knows what she went through before she arrived here. Get as much rest as you can. I'll be right here if you need anything at all. It's going to be alright. What is your name? Nakomay Lee. That's beautiful. I'm Ethel. My father is Thomas and my brother is Benjamin. We were all quite concerned for you. Where is Naydia? Where is she? It's okay. I'm sorry Nakomay. I'm so very sorry. [WEEPING] I'm so sorry Nakomay. [EMOTIONAL MUSIC] [FOOTSTEPS] Your hands are so cold. Sit while I get you some tea. [DISTANT FOOTSTEPS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Mr. Thomas. I can't bother you all to stay here much longer. You have all done so much for me already, I... ...what will others think if they know you are allowing me shelter? The opinion of others is of no concern to me, or any of us for that matter. You're welcome in this house for as long as you'd like to stay. Is there anyone you would like me to notify... ...that you are safe? There is no one. I'm truly sorry to hear that. You know... ...I don't think you found us by chance. I think you were meant to find us. [TRAIN WHISTLE] [TRAIN WHISTLE] Things around these parts haven't gotten a lot better. Of what do you speak? There has been a group of men running amuck... ...causing all sorts of havoc here on the frontier. Some of the worst have been burning down entire towns... ...and kidnapping the women. It's not good, son. You don't think that- -Nakomay? I've thought about her. The heartache she has endured. Sounds far too similar to what these men are doing. If that is the case, it would explain so much. It does indeed. I'm just thankful she found us when she did. As am I. [TRAIN WHISTLE] [CRASHING WAVES] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Nakomay! I couldn't help but notice you from a distance. Are you alright? My mother... ...she was quite beautiful. Her own mother died in childbirth... ...leaving her solely to be raised by her father. He became a drunk and could be wildly abusive. One day when she realized she could take it no longer... ...she fled from home. She was quite young to be out on her own. She soon encountered a young man. My father. He was a white man. Noble character. Highly educated. They fell in love and soon married. My siblings and I were raised to learn English. Reading and writing. Three years ago... ...our home and land were burned in the night. Everything we had was taken. Mother and father did all they could to protect us from the terror. It was the last time we ever saw them. From that moment on... ...my sister, brother, and I were left to fend for ourselves. We had nowhere to go... ...because we were not accepted by many white people... ...nor people from our tribe. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Never be sorry for bearing your heart. It takes great courage. Thank you for trusting enough to confide in me. You're so brave. [EMOTIONAL MUSIC] BENJAMIN: I didn't expect to see you this time of night. Would you care to join me? I... ...I suppose. NAKOMAY: Pardon me. What do you think you're doing? I'm sorry. I was going to say a blessing. Dear Lord... ...thank you for this bounty before us. May we use it for the nourishment of our bodies and our bodies to thy service. Amen. I didn't see you much around today. I just... ...I thought a little time of solitude would be best. I understand. I hope this meal isn't too harshly imposing on your plans. No. Not at all. Thank you. So tell me. What is it that you love? I'm sorry? I... ...just trying to get to know you better... ...that's all. You like to write I see. Poems mostly. I do love poetry. I would like to read a bit of your work sometime. Oh, I... ...I don't know. It's just... ...I've never let anyone read my writing before... ...that's all. Maybe one day you'll change your mind. Thank you again for the meal. It was lovely. Thank you for joining me. It was a pleasure to have your company. [HORSE NEIGHS] [DOOR KNOCKING] Benjamin, my dear, what a pleasant surprise it is to see you. How do you do, Mrs. Harvey? Do come in. Frank will be delighted to have your company. How is he? Mr. Harvey How are you doing sir? Uh, Benjamin. So nice to have a... ...friendly face stop in. You know. You have really been on my mind lately. Me sir? You know, our boy... ...William. He was to... ...follow in my footsteps. With William being gone... ...I've had a lot of thought... ...who is going to continue on. Ben, I really want you... ...to be the one to take over the church. And I know... ...that is a big thing to ask of you. Could you go home... ...and pray about it, will ya? I will sir. Thank you. Take care of yourself. Thank you Benjamin, God be with you. [CRASHING WAVES] So much bad has happened. I seem not to understand it. Why her? Naydia was so young. Why didn't they take me instead? How did it happen? We had been on the run for sometime. I thought we were safe. My brother thought the same. Somehow they found us. They took our furs, our belongings. Everything. I did everything I could. I tried. Of course you did. It wasn't your fault. I just don't understand. I can't let you do this to yourself any longer. You have to realize it wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault. Help me, please. I'll be right here, every step of the way. We'll get through this together. I promise. [GUN SHOT] NAKOMAY: Good try Ethel. [BENJAMIN LAUGHING] BENJAMIN: Let me give it a try. [GUN SHOT] Father are you alright? Our brigade... ...marched out of Williamsburg, October 2nd. 1864. Many a strong man quivered... ...overcome with numb emotion, for we knew what lie ahead. As we proceeded into battle... ...that dreary day. I never imagined my life would be spared. The battlefield, sweeping green pastures... ...rolling hillside was advantageous for cannon operations. A job for which we were tasked. The pride of the human spirit weighed heavy... ...like sulfurous smoke, clouding the skies, long before a cannon was ever fired. In the end days when the heavens are rolled up like a scroll, I doubt if it will present a more awe inspiring spectacle than that of the historic field that fatal morn. When I was at my lowest... ...thinking all hope was forever in the past. That's when I heard- -Heard what? The voice of what I dare say was an angel. [HEAVY BREATHING] [CANNON FIRE IN DISTANCE] He leadeth me. O blessed thought. O words with heavenly comfort fraught. Whate'er I do. Where'er I be. Still 'tis God's hand... ...that leadeth me. His faithful follower... ...I would be. For by His hand... ...He leadeth me. [SOBS] Oh father. It was as though God was reminding me that I was not alone. [DELICATE MUSIC] BENJAMIN VO: Elegant. Like the breeze flowing gently on an early spring morning. Captivating. Like the rolling waves that crash upon a dry... ...welcoming shore. Distant. Like a far off island full of vast unexplored mystery. Beautiful. Intriguing. Alluring. You. [EMOTIONAL MUSIC] I too know the severe heartache of losing someone you love. You hear that time will soften the pain, but... ...I scoff at that. When my father was away at war our home was overtaken. We all stood there... ...helplessly watching the needless destruction of our belongings. My mother was holding me in her arm... ...and James in the other. Benjamin was standing by her side. There was a noise of some sort and James... ...somehow managed to break free from my mother's grip. There were soldiers all around. A soldier. Unsympathetically just shot my mother and walked away. Leaving three small children alone. Scared and motherless. Oh Ethel. I had no idea. I'm so very sorry. Though... ...she was only with you for a short time... ...her legacy continues to live on through her children. That is quite apparent. Every since that tragedy... ...Benjamin and I rarely left one another's side. James on the other hand, he has never been the same. I truly believe he still blames himself for the accident. But he was so young. He didn't do that intentionally. I do pray that one day he will realize that too. How did you come to live out west? My father came home from the war following mother's passing and... ...we only spent one night in our desolate destroyed home. The following day we packed up and came out here. I think the pain of being there was too great for father to bear. I can't say I wouldn't have done the same. After arriving here my father planted this tree in her memory. I think it was his way of keeping her near him always. [INTENSE MUSIC] Are you alright? How many you think you've put in the ground since we started all this? Well. I stopped keeping count a long time ago. Why didn't you let me kill those dirty savages when I had the chance... ...down at that hill? Are you, are you gettin' soft on me? You, uh, you think I'm gettin' soft? [GUN CLICK] You're just not the same, boss. We had been tracking those three filthy savages for some time now. Watching their every move. Noting their every pattern. Then we do what we always do. We take the strength from 'em. And there is nothing like seeing the pain in their faces when you take their lifeblood. When I saw them two cowered down... ...I knew takin' the young one, would hurt the most. That's 'cause sufferin'... ...can do a lot more hurt to a person than death. I want her back! Men will pay a high price for her. Yeah. We'll get her back. ETHEL: You seem rather quiet, is everything alright? Yes, I'm fine. I've just been thinking about our conversation earlier. Oh? It's just... ...despite your loss and heartache of losing someone so very dear... ...how are you able to continue on in such a way? There are days where I feel as though hope hangs around like a dear old friend. Those days are few and far between. More often than not I feel as though I can't grasp the hope and peace that I have seen you all attain. It's as if it comes naturally. Our hope has never been grounded within ourselves my dear. It hasn't? Well then how? Hope and peace of the nature of which you speak do not come from within. They in their truest forms are not enough to sustain you amid the struggles of life. But when found in the Lord. They become your guiding light. And despite the devastations that we may face. His unwavering love will... ...walk alongside us the rest of our days. You have to reach a point where you can just lose the grip of it all. A point where... ...letting go feels more freeing than holding tightly. Where can I find this? All you need to do is reach out and boldly ask for it. That's it? That's it. [HOWLING WIND] [CRASHING WAVES] God. I've heard your voice in the silence. I've felt you in the wind. Never did I know it was you... ...someone in whom I never believed. You beckon me with your calm stillness. God. Hear my cries. Stay near me. I need you. Now. And forevermore. [HOPEFUL MUSIC] [THUNDERING WAVES] [DELICATE MUSIC] [DOOR KNOCK] BENJAMIN VO: Dearest Nakomay, I hope this letter comes to you as no disturbance. My silence I shall keep no more as thoughts of you continually cross my mind. The moments in which we have spent together... ...I have taken not a single one for granted. I hope our days together go without number. It is with deepest sincerity... ...that I ask your accompaniment in the morning. If you so desire... ...meet me near the river after sunrise. Benjamin. [MORNING BIRDS CHIRPING] I see you received my letter. Indeed I did. It was quite the unexpected surprise to say the least. Well, are you ready? Where are we going? You'll see. [HOPEFUL MUSIC] [LAUGHING] [CONTINUED HOPEFUL MUSIC] [SOFT CRASHING WAVES] It's times like this that make me feel as though I don't have a care in the world. Today... ...you don't. It's an honor to have this time with you today. You're a remarkable woman, Nakomay. Promise me this won't be our last adventure together. It's far from our last. [HOPEFUL MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Nakomay! Nakomay! It's ok, It's just James. I promise, everything is fine. [SIGHS] I'm sorry. Hey, no need to be sorry. It's James, as in your brother? Yes, how did you know? Ethel told me. Does he come around often? No, not usually. Well, I'll leave you be. No warm welcome I see. It's been a while. It's good to see you, James. Pardon me for asking, but have you been drinking? Some. Sorry I'm not able to be an outstanding gentleman like yourself. James, I'm not... Every family has their mess up. And you've not dealt with life the way I have. Alright. ETHEL: James! What a wonderful surprise. It's so good seeing you around here, son. Ethel is just finishing preparing a meal we would love to have you join us. Is everything alright? JAMES: I'm fair enough. Just been busy that's all. Let me help you. Help me? And what is it that you think I need help with? I already told you that I'm fine. It's not you James. You're not yourself. It pains me deeply to see you like this. Ethel. Just stop. Please, just tell me what you need from me! Stop. He just needs some time dear. What are you doing out here? I just need some alone time. Our brother has been away for months and you now feel it's time to be alone. It seems as though you're hiding. Hiding? Hiding from what? You can't do this every time James shows up. Benjamin. He needs us, you and me! We can't let him do this to himself any longer. I know he needs us. I do. I want to see him change, I really do. But how do you bring change to someone... ...who doesn't show a single desire for it. You love him. That's how. No matter what I've done you've always been there for me. And although I've strayed from time to time. You've always been a friend and comfort when I needed you the most. Be that for him. You're right. He will listen to you. Have you seen the way that he looks up to you? It's never been of... ...jealousy or anger. It's always been of admiration. And now it's seemingly hidden amid the turmoil in his mind, but it's still there. He just needs his brother now more than ever. You have a way of getting to him when no one else can. You just have to be patient with him. I truly believe he'll come around. Ok. [EMOTIONAL MUSIC] BENJAMIN: James! There's someone I would like you to meet. This is Nakomay. Nakomay, this is my brother James. NAKOMAY: How do you do? NAKOMAY: I'll let you be. If you both would please excuse me. It was nice to meet you. BENJAMIN: Is that the best you can do? Who is she? What is she doing here? A woman like that has no business being in a place like this. She lives here. She what? Have I been away for such a time that I have missed so much? It's beginning to seem that way. Don't tell me you take an interest in that woman. It's apparent in the way you look at her. But she's far different than the both of us. Don't you act like you don't see that. I don't see her any different than I see you... ...or anyone else for that matter. Listen to yourself. Do you truly believe you can have a future with a woman like that? - I believe that... - Oh, Benjamin. Think about what you're doing. What are people going to think about you? Besides... ...father told me about your plans to become a minister. How you do something of that sort when you run around with the likes of her, huh? Have you no notion of what it takes to hold a position like that? I know exactly what it takes. I firmly believe, brother... ...you've lost sight of it all. Pardon my foolishness. I think at times I just... ...allow my prejudice to get the best of me... ...for that, I guess I do owe you an apology. You ever think about... ...what it might be like if mother was still here? Of course I do. - I think about it quite often. - As do I. You don't... I don't what? You don't still blame yourself, do you? Ah, Ben. That's easy for you to say, you did nothing wrong. If I had not been such a reckless fool. You and I wouldn't be having this conversation and you know that to be true. You were merely just a child. Yeah, one who caused his mother her life. Benjamin... ...I'm trapped. I find it difficult to see above this cloud of disparity that just looms over me. This war inside my mind that I fight from sunrise to sunset... ...it's a bitter battle and if I dwell there for too long I... ...I feel as though I'm losing it... ...truly. The pain you've dealt with is echoed throughout our family. Although we fathom... ...life with mother here. We've never once cast the blame on you. Why don't you stay here with us a while? Would you consider it? I would. If it be permissible with father and Ethel. I can speak for all of us in agreement. We need you here. [HOPEFUL MUSIC] [SOFT CRASHING WAVES] [LAUGHING] I can see it. BENJAMIN: What is it that you see? Love. For the first time... ...I see love. It's breathtaking. Marry me. NAKOMAY: Yes. Yes, I will. [HOPEFUL MUSIC] [SOFT HOPEFUL MUSIC] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Isn't funny how life has a way of becoming - something you never dreamt. - Certainly. I wouldn't for a moment change my present for what lie in my imagination. Is that so? Had my mother been here... ...oh, I have spent many nights wishing that. I would be quite the different woman then the one I am now. It brought me far closer to my father and brothers... ...and our love developed in a unique way... ...that I'll treasure forever. The way this family loves is unlike any I've seen before. You've changed me my dear. For the better. For your presence I am thankful. Knowing that you will be forever a part of this family brings me all the more joy. I have something I want to show you. Follow me. What is this? It's my mother's wedding dress. It's breathtaking. What a sweet tangible memory to possess. I've been saving this for my wedding day. But now that you and Benjamin are to be wed it would be my greatest honor to see you wear it. Me? No, I couldn't do that. Look. You will be the most beautiful bride in all the world. I can't put into words what this means to me. I don't know how to thank you. You wearing this dress is thanks enough. Oh how I will forever remember this precious moment. The whole concept of marriage is something quite new to me. Would you do me a great honor? It would mean everything for you to stand by me on my wedding day. Most certainly my dear. Thank you. [GIGGLING] When we were children, James, Benjamin, and I would spend a great deal of time out in this field. See those trees over there? We would see who could best get to the top first. James had quite a competitive spirit about him. Oh to be young and carefree again. [HOWLING WIND] Did you hear something? I did. I don't see anything though. NAKOMAY: We've been gone for quite a while. Maybe we should start to head back. [DISTANT HORSE NEIGHS] No. Come on, hurry. No! Please! Take me not her! Please! [HORSE NEIGHS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [INAUDIBLE] [GUN SHOT] [CRYING] Ethel! You can't leave me. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [CRYING] NO! Ethel! [SCREAMING] [DELICATE MUSIC] My sweet Ethel. [FAINT WHISPERS] [CRASHING WOOD] What's wrong? No. No. You're okay. You're going to be okay. Look at me! [CRYING] [SAD MUSIC] [INAUDIBLE] [HORSE SNORTS] [HORSE NEIGHS] Well, what do we have here? EDWARD: It's our unintentional find tonight boys. She's a lovely one I'll say. WALTER: Wait a minute. I think I remember this one. You! [GRUNTING] [EMOTIONAL MUSIC] Father! Help! Help. [DOOR SLAM] Nakomay! Where is she? I don't know. James! Where is Nakomay! They took her. You tell me what you need from me. We have to find her! No matter what it takes! We have to find her! [HOPEFUL MUSIC] [GUNS CLANK] [SIGHS] What is it that you want from me? The war is over! You've taken our land. You've taken our loved ones. You stood by... ...and allowed my siblings to be mercilessly killed. And for what? What more could you possibly want? EDWARD: What did you just say to me? Around these parts, miss, I always get what I want. And who do you think you are to talk to me in such a manner? I'll tell you who I am. I am a child of God. I will not fall into despair. No matter what is taken from me. My spirit cannot be broken. For even in this bondage I have freedom. My freedom, it lies within. And it cannot be taken from me. Despite any attempts that you make. [HEROIC MUSIC] [GUN SHOT] - [GUNSHOT] - [GUNSHOT] JAMES: Ah! [GRUNTING] No! [GUNSHOT] James! Look at me! James! NAKOMAY: No! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [SMACK] [SMACK] [GUN CLICK] [SIGHS] [GUN CLICK] [EXHALES SHARPLY] [SMACK] [HOPEFUL MUSIC] You came for me. There's nothing in this world that will keep me from you. I'll always fight for you. James! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [HOPEFUL MUSIC] [CRACKLING] [CRASHING WAVES] [SAD MUSIC] [CRYING] Near the cross... ...I watch and wait. Hoping, trusting, ever. Till I reach... ...that golden strand, just beyond the river. In the cross. In the cross. Be my glory ever. Till my ransomed soul shall find. Rest beyond the river. Till my ransomed soul shall find. Rest beyond the river. At times... ...when we're staring into the face of fear. Feeling as though we can't even catch another breath. This is when we needn't lose our hope. For it is hope that is our greatest weapon. With it, the darkest hours... ...can be split wide open. Despite... ...grave heartache. Hope found in Christ. This is the sole thing that you have... ...in which you can hold. As many of you may know... ...my health... ...has been in a steady decline. But with joyful heart. Our beloved, Benjamin Nelson. Will graciously... ...be taking my place as your new minister. And for that, we are abundantly grateful. [DISTANT TALKING] [DOOR SHUTTING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [HOWLING WIND] [SQUEAKING DOOR] Do you think God could ever forgive a wretch like me? I've just... ...done so much. [DELICATE MUSIC] I do believe He will. Completely. I've done so many detestable things. The record of wrongs I've caused is... ...too numerous to count. I've just never understood, why, God... ...if there is a God... ...would ever allow someone to take a shape like mine. Many people think that it's God that has walked away from us when all along it's we who have walked away from Him. We've been sought after with an extravagant... ...long pursuing love. This love requires nothing from us but... ...in one in which everything is given. It's one in which we ought mirror. One we freely give to our fellow man. But despite the devastation that I've caused you and your family, how can you in good conscience treat me with such kindness? My actions, they're unforgivable. Nursing a bitter wound will do nothing but destroy from within. I have forgiven you. To be truthful, we all have. [HOPEFUL MUSIC] [CRASHING WAVES] [HOPEFUL MUSIC] NAKOMAY VO: Life can deal you a hand which you never expected to receive. Our struggles are only momentary. At times, they feel as though they stretch into a span of eternity. It felt as though the one thing for which I deeply longed was too distant to reach. As it turns out... ...I found that one thing I fought so long... ...so hard for, was fighting twice as hard for me. Love. Love runs wildly, eradicating darkness with each passing step. Hope is at its side. Continually casting out fear. It is patient. Oh so very patient. It's a kind friend. One which you feel has always belonged. It dances amid the most violent storms. No record of wrong does it keep. When you choose to release the grasp of fear and defeat... ...it in turn sets your soul afire. When your steepest mountains refuse to move, believe that a stream will lead you out. Trust that your tears are not wept in vain, but help aid in your healing. Trust in your past. For it shapes how you walk in your tomorrows. Lean continually into the one who holds the earth delicately in the palm of His hand. Without fail. He will always be the greatest source of strength and comfort. In time of lack and plenty. Lastly... Forget not to trust in love. For it is by this that all things are made whole. Made beautiful.
