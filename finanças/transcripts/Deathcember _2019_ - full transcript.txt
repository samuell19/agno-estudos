Yes! ADVENT CALENDARS 0,99 € Your sister's calendar wasn't enough for you? I guess you'll never be satisfied. Eat me! Calendarum Maleficarum! Calendarum Maleficarum! Calendarum Maleficarum. Calendarum Maleficarum... Where... where am I? Hello?? Help needy children! Help... help needy children? Thank you so much, have a happy holiday. Hey, um... help a child in need this year? Have a great Christmas. - You know, your money could... - Not today, thank you. - Thank you, Merry Christmas. - Happy Holidays. Merry Christmas. - Oh, finally. - Hey! Uh... okay. How can I help you? I need to make a return. Is there something wrong with it? Is the product faulty, defective or unsatisfactory in some way? No, but in the time since I bought it something newer and better came out that my son wants more. And, well, Blaine deserves the best. Well, if Blaine deserves it... It's Christmas after all. Do you have the receipt? - Of course. - Okay. It's here somewhere. Ma'am... You know... I can't seem to find it. But it's still in the box, so you can take it back. I'm afraid not, I need the receipt. Come on. It's Christmas. It's store policy. I shop here all the time. I am a good customer. Well, a lot of people shop here all the time. But I'm afraid rules are rules, ma'am. You need the receipt. That's absurd. There are other people waiting, ma'am. If you find the receipt later, you can always... You know, I'm sorry. I don't have time to come back later. This is crazy. You know? You should just take it. No! You know, you would ruin a little boy's Christmas by not helping me. I don't know how I'd do that. He's got a perfectly good toy right here. But it's not what he wants. Which is not what I want. And the customer is always right! Sure. If they have the receipt. Now, ma'am, if you don't have what's required to make the return... Next. Fuck you. Happy Holidays, ma'am. Thank you so much for shopping at Keller's. Yeah. I didn't think so either. - No, really... - And my aunt called... Hey! - Did you just hit me with that? - Really? You hit a woman. He hit a woman! Well, haven't you heard? Gender is over! Ow! Bitch! You entitled suburban piece of shit! Retail reject! Yeah, I don't think so... You ruined Christmas! You're welcome. Now can you make the return? I'll see what I can do. Dear Comrade.

PLEASE, BE PUNCTUAL. You are half an hour early. - Marc? - Hm? Are you okay? Yes. Okay. Come, we have to go inside. Mum and Dad are expecting us. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, darling. - Marc. - Daniel. Glad to see you again. Let's have a toast! To our first Christmas together. Together with Marc! Cheers. And that's why, Marc, the first present is for you. You know what you have to do? Yes. This knife belonged to my Dad. And he got it from my grandfather. And now... It's your turn. You can do it, honey! Do it, Marc. To the young couple, Esther and Marc! And Marc... Welcome to the family. Hm? Hm. Hm. Hm? Huh? Huh! Huh? Hm? ♪ Hm-hm ♪ Hm? Hm? Greetings from Krampus Huh? Hm? Hm? Hm? Hm? Huh? Please! Please! We're family! Please! Hello, Mother! I'm home. Mother. It's the holidays. Must we discuss this now? I refuse to let you gamble away the family fortune. Well, I think you'd be surprised how easily I can make it back. Oh, there they are. The charity cases have arrived. Hello, Mother. I'm sorry we're late. Oh, an apology! Well, you must be the adopted member of the family. Don't you need to give yourself 40 lashes as penance now? Serge, stop it. That's enough now. Good evening all! Merry, merry and whatnot... Oh, yes. Baby brother, have another drink. Let's get you a cappuccino, Hilton. I'm fine, mother. I really, really, I'm fine, I'm fine... Is he drunk again? Yes. Everything will be fine. Well, all we're waiting on is your sister. Well, Flavia's probably shacked up with her flavor of the month. Little whore can't be bothered. Just cut her out of the will already. Hilton! Shut your goddamn mouth. This might be the last Christmas we spend together. Hopefully. Well, that won't do, will it? Mm-mm. Don't worry, Mother. I won't touch any of your precious private reserve. No use wasting this on the children, am I right? Oh! Mother?! Please, stop! Stop! I was adopted into a family of sinners. A whore. A drunk. And a degenerate gambler. And you raised them. Yours was the worst sin of all. But I've righted your wrongs for you. So... the inheritance is rightfully mine. Your real children would've just squandered it. Whoa... - Are you okay? - Thank God you're here. She's... she's been lying to us this entire time. Did you find it? What's up? What are you doing? I don't want to go. Let's go. I want to do something. Do what? I'm going to kill that son of a bitch! Listen to me carefully. We're going home. Now. He should be in jail. Maybe it's not him. Yes it is. Please, let's go. Don't worry. I understand you, really. You didn't love him. What are you talking about? I'm talking about Dad. You didn't love him like I did. How many people are there in the world? Ah, about six billion. Why are you asking? How does Santa deliver all those presents in just one night? Well, that's why he's got his elves. Santa's little helpers. Talking of little helpers... were you two in my bedroom today? No. Well, then it must've been a burglar. Because somebody has been in my wardrobe. You know what happens to children that tell lies on Christmas Eve, don't you, Leo? No. They get a visit from Krampus. Who's Krampus? Krampus is a horned demon that punishes children that misbehave. He puts naughty children in his sack, and then carts them off to Hell, where they suffer eternal damnation. Bill, you're scaring her. Well, she doesn't have to be scared if she hasn't been naughty. Isn't that right, Emma? Aren't you in bed yet? Santa won't come unless you're asleep. I'm going now. - Night, night. - Night, Mum. Emma? Come on, bedtime. What do you think? Where did you get that stuff? Joke shop. I think Krampus might be paying you a visit. Happy Christmas, Leo! That's pretty. Your dad chose that all by himself. Okay, here's one for Leo. It's massive. What is it? Happy Christmas, Leo. Yeah, Happy Christmas, Leo. So pretty. Mimi, do you want it like this? Or like this? Ta-da! Shall we try something else this time? That doll is not yours but mine! Give it to me! Hey! Excuse me! Mister! I hate your hair. What the hell did the doll ever do to you? Ah, for fuck's sake. Fucking bitch... da fuck off me! Gah, fuck... Crazy bitch! Daddy! Daddy! For fuck's sake. Daddy, please help me! I promise I'll be good. I don't wanna die. Ha-young cut me with the knife. Daddy! Ha-na killed my doll. We should probably get rid of this knife. Wow, a present! Open it up and see! Ta-da! It's a doll. Ha-young! This sweet little doll will always listen to you, and never scream. Wow, she looks just like my dead sister. I promised I would give you twins. Don't harass her, just play with her for the rest of your life. Wow, so pretty... From now on, you'll be my doll. I prefer you as a doll. You talked too much when you were alive. I promised your father I'd say goodbye to you today. It should've been me. You can have him back. Who are you? Your prayers have been answered, Eva. Are you an angel? What would you do... to have things the way they were? Anything. Your boy is there. Dig. I can't. I'm the miracle you asked for! Dig! Dig! Dig! Dig! You came back to me. And so it begins. LOST COTTAGE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE Valentina, what are you doing? It's not even Christmas yet, and you're undoing the tree? I hate Christmas, understood? All these lights, everyone loving each other. Enough! Look, Valentina, I've got presents for Dad and the kids. Where are they? They're in there, go! Just leave me alone. Dad? Dad? Dad, where are you? Dad? Dad! Dad, wake up! Dad, I have a present for you, wake up. Dad... Dad, wake up. The kids. The kids! Kids? Kids? Have you given them the presents? Yes. Yes, I have. Dad? Dad? - Granddad, is she gone? - Yes. Let's go get her, quick! My sister even hangs herself to get attention. - But Mum, she's dead. - She's dead! He has to hit back or they won't stop. He needs to stand up for himself. He needs somebody to talk to. - Says the babysitter. - Says your sister. Who knows him best, because, surprise, I actually show up. Who the fuck keeps eating my chips? He draws his mom. All the time. He's afraid that he's going to forget her. Well, maybe he should forget her. Hey, Jack. Your Daddy and Aunt Gina need to talk for a little bit in private. Why don't you go write a letter to Santa? I already did. That's okay, you can write another one. Just make sure that you leave out some milk and cookies, to make his trip back worthwhile. Fruity shit like this is why he gets made fun of at school. Nice. You pick that one up from Dad? Get the fuck out of my house. Careful, Bob. Last time you said that to a woman, she actually did. Hey, Applejack. I'll see you soon, okay? I wanna go home with you. I'm working on it. Dear Santa, Please help Gallops. He's hurt. Love, Jack. Gallops! Where the hell did you get a glue gun? The attic? What's a goo-gun? All right, wise guy. Who did this? Santa. No! Go to your room. Now! Ugh. Are you fucking kidding me? Dad? Is it dinner? I'm hungry. Dear Santa, I wish my door would stay open. Love, Jack. Jack! I don't have to worry, I don't have to care. My coat is very furry, I'm a grizzly, grizzly bear. Hello? Hey, buddy. You turn off my TV? You know Daddy sleeps with it on. Thank you. I'm so sorry, Applejack. You can stay with me as long as you want. Forever? Forever. Thank you, Santa. - Hands off! - Come on, relax. Man, you're getting on my nerves. Hey! Easy, bro. I'm not your damn bro! Get lost, Schmock. I recognized him. I'll never forget that face. Okay, listen. You're gonna mark him. I can't do this. His smell makes me sick. You don't have to smell him. In the crowd at the entrance, you put a mark on his back. A "P" for "Pig"! Hey. You wait outside the door until we text you. Let us pass, our friend has been drinking too much! RAPE Get off me, you... No! THE PIG IS READY Girls, watch out, he's waking up! Hold him down! Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Do it, Caren. That's not him. That's the wrong one! You've got the wrong one! There are no wrong ones. What was that? A bear? It ain't no bear. It's too big. Buffalo? Buffalo? With claws? Bit off half my mare's ass! Swallowed my pack and every goddamn thing in it. That's sheer cliff for a solid mile. If it falls off, it'll kill it. I mean, it damn near killed us. What if it does get down here? It's gonna come at us from that-a-way. Go on, hit the trail. You and me have been at this a long time. I couldn't possibly do that. It ain't worth it for you to stick around here. You've done everything for me... No, I mean, I... I couldn't possibly do that. I broke my foot when I tumbled off the cliff. - Why ain't you hollerin'? - What? Why ain't you hollerin'? What good is hollerin' gonna do? Well, you don't have to be such a son of a bitch about it. - What? - Nothin'. No. You got somethin' to say, why don't you say it? - Nothin'. - Nothin'. That's probably what it amounted to. I hate to piss on Christmas, but I do believe we're gonna die tonight. I don't want to. Well, life is just one "I don't want to" after another. Maybe... dying will just be the last one. Is it gone? Yes, it's been real quiet. Hopefully it just ran off. I mean, it's got a belly full of horse meat. Coyote we can handle. May see Christmas after all? Got you something. Hey now, what's this? Eh, I saw you eye-balling it up there in El Paso. I didn't get you nothin'. It's all right. Eleven years a good riding partner, that's somethin'. Merry Christmas. Hey now... Let's hear it sing. Something Christmas-y? 'Tis that time of year. I can't play with you lookin' at me. What? It found a way down. We can stab it. We can shoot it. And we can burn it. So, I think that you never see... something like this before in your life. Hm. Okay, let's go there. I'm just gonna watch you do it. I have two! Is there anything I should know about this "saint" of ours? Huh, well... he's like a protector, you know? Protecting whom? The poor. And travelers. Okay. It's like a tradition, you know. And also people want to eat and drink a lot, so... - So, cheers to that! - Yeah. Babe, is everything okay? It's just my brother. You know, our brother. I mean... You mean my cousin, your brother. Yeah, your cousin, my brother. He's somewhere, driving drunk. What is he doing again? He got this shitty job, going around in his Yugo, entertaining people for the holiday. Ah, he's some kind of Santa, right? Yeah, right. I knew... I knew I was gonna suck at this. I just knew it. And this ice is kind of... unfriendly. Well, sorry I'm bitching too much. It's nice to be here with you, and finally meet this side of the family. And you should visit us soon. Poor thing. You're freezing. I don't have... nothing... under... Fuck! After these messages, Rush Limbaugh will be here, talking about the war on Christmas. Don't let Christmas drive you crazy! Just go crazy for our prices! Christmas... Barney's Barn, where we have gifts galore! We're the one with the giant Rudolph on the roo... Greedy fucking bullshit. Fucking Christmas crap. Is there somebody else here? Hello? Uh... I can hardly contain my excitement. Fuck! Silent night Holy night All is calm All is bright Round yon Virgin - Mother and Child... - Uh, thank you. Holy infant... I'm not really doing Christmas this year. - Silent Night, holy night... - Get the fuck off me! All is calm, all is bright Holy infant, so tender and mild... What are you doing? Ah! Get off me! - Sleep in heavenly peace - Why are you doing this? Silent night Holy night All is calm All is bright Round yon Virgin Mother and Child Holy infant So tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace I thought about you this year, I kept everything low cal. You should really talk to your brother about his new business. Maybe he's looking for an assistant. What is this, is it... - Polyester? - Polyester. Oh my word, Madeline! You made it. Merry Christmas, Dad. Johnnyboy, in the business, you gotta be a shark, man! Fearless. The thing is in front of you, that you want? You get it! Okay. If it's still alive, you kill it. That's it, that's all, man. You gotta do it yourself. You know, so, let's say, you think, you think I would give a shit... ...he was driving drunk and he went to prison. Really? Yeah. For Christmas! No Miami, no nothing. Poor soul. Look at those little buns, I could eat them up! Hey-hey! Uncle. Kids, sit down. Oh, cheerio, Rose! Isn't she pretty. To the beauty of youth! Rose! Come say hello to your uncle. Hm? Rose! No, sweetheart, Kevin is expecting an important call from China. Bring this to the living room, your cousins must be hungry. Okay, I had the idea where I... Cut it off. That's full of gluten! Lesson one, son. You want something, you take it. So, Rose... still single? Yes. Police are on the scene of a double homicide in Montreal North this evening. Tragedy strikes when one family member turns up to Christmas Dinner, armed with a hunting rifle. Ohhh again! Take another one... Oh, bravo! Leave this here, we'll take care of it. We were starting to think your mother put us on a diet. Really. Whoa, Rose is drunk. Oh Rosie, you're so skinny. Gotta put some meat on those bones. Rose. Merry Christmas! - Noah! - Come on, we're gonna be late. I told you, give me a second. Yeah, thirty minutes ago. - Sorry. - It's whatever. You are such a little shit. Well, you left me alone. You said you'd be fine. Well, you said you wouldn't, so... There you are. Kugel's getting cold. You're an ass. And I'm a little shit, so... Can't win 'em all! Do you even know what "Kugel" is? Yeah, it's the bread thing, right? Don't worry, you'll find out. - You're such a bad Jew. - Only by blood. We haven't been Jewish since mom died, so I was like, what? Three years old? It's all Christmas now for Carol. Come on, we still need jelly donuts and extra candleholders. Well, pedal faster. We've never been late before. Yeah, so they can't be that mad. What's the deal with that anyway? Home before sundown? It's just a stupid tradition. It wasn't always. There were these lost stories. Old stories, like bible-old. They told of this darkness that came every 13 years, and it took children away who weren't home before sundown. No one knew where it came from or what it was, but... those it took were never seen from again. Only the pieces of them that were left behind. Over the years people forgot what they were hiding from. It became tradition. But it was more than that. It was survival. And this year is the 13th year of the cycle. That can't be true. But that's the point, you wouldn't know. No one would. Hey wait, did you hear that? Hear what? Where? Don't freak him out. Always too spooky. If you could've just kept your tongue to yourself we wouldn't be late. Oh my God, what crawled up you? You'll still be Jewish next year. Hey, wait. Did you guys see that? Still not funny. No, I'm being serious. - Shit! - Oh my God! Noah, come on! We're not gonna make it! Noah, just keep going. We're almost there, all right? I know a short cut, okay? Just go! Are we even now? Honey, that was just fantastic. You know... I'd be happy if that was the last meal I'd ever ate. But sadly, all good things must come to an end. Couldn't... Couldn't it wait until after she opens her presents? Ah... What did we agree? I didn't agree to anything. Not like this! What... was the agreement? Six o'clock. Eighteen hundred hours. I don't like doing this any more than you two, but, it's the way it has to be now. 180 seconds, then it's all over. We all go. I'll even go first. Darling, it's supposed to be fun. What makes a moon rock taste better than an Earth rock? It's a little meteor! You're up, sweetie. Oh, get on with it! Did you hear? They opened a new restaurant on the moon. I hear the food's good, but it lacks a little atmosphere. And what do you think you're going to do with that? There's no way out of this. Don't you get it? They see everything. Mother... Ooh! Crackers, is it? Oh, give us a go, love. Good evening and Merry Christmas. It is 1,440 days since a cataclysmic solar incident severed the Lunar Falls terraforming station from its orbit with Earth's moon. Tonight marks the fourth yearly round of the randomized population control protocols. Lunar Falls would like to thank our lower-tier employees for their compliance. Thanks to you, thousands of workers continue to have access to the provisions necessary to keep our facility in tip top shape! Thanks for your co-operation! Controlling the population! If you don't like the situation we'll show you the door! Charades? Well, tonight's the night, folks, Christmas Eve. The jolly man has made his list and checked it twice, and I'm wishing for the same thing I do every year, a white Christmas. But that's never gonna happen, because we're KHOT, the smooth sound of the desert. Santa? Is that really you? Dumb kid, I don't need you. Hey! Bronson, what the hell are you doing? Mom! Help! Tell me where he is! Fuck, who was at the fucking... Where is he? Where's who? Let go of my fucking kid! You fucking motherfucker! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Oh no! Yo! You about fucking done in there or what? Four more kilos to go. How the fuck are we supposed to get all this shit to Ohio in, like, five hours? Don't worry, man, we got it all figured out. Operation Dolph is in full effect! Okay, you got me! I'm not one of them! I... I just make the stuff, man! I'm the chemist! Where is he? Who are you? Okay, okay! He's in the shed out back. We didn't hurt him, I swear. No... Shit. I'm here. It's okay. You're safe. But there's no time to celebrate... we've got a lot of work to do tonight! - Oh! Krieger. - Hello. - Where to? - To Trapp. - Ah. - On my own! Trapp, you dumb pig. You'll send this out to the Japs before five today! Ah, you're right on cue. Thank you. What? You didn't receive the report? I-I-I apologize! Yes, yes, immediately, Mr. Kanagawa. Yes, immediately, yes. Bye-bye! Bye-bye! What's this dweeb's number again? Ah, 6-13. Bloody hell! He really gets nothing done at all, this dipshit!! Trapp, that idiot from the sixth floor, has screwed up the Japan job. Trapp? But I thought he was on sick leave? He's not getting extra vacation for a burnout! I told him to show up and get the crap done. I have to get the report. Nah, one of the chicks will do it. What an asshole. Hello? Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt. I just wanted to get something. Mr. Trapp? I'm here to get the report. Mr. Trapp? What a joke. What kind of a circus is this? You'll send this out to the Japs before five today! You'll send this out to the Japs before five today! That idiot from the 6th floor.. This dipshit... Trapp, you dumb pig. Will you come back as a trainee? Oh, you're serious? Yes, of course. Once I take over, a lot will change around here. Mister Kanagawa! We need to restructure. Yeah. I will take over Mr. Krieger's position for now. We need some adjustment time here. But, I'll make sure to send over the report to you today. Was kind of an emergency step for us, but everything is fine. Now, Ryder, my boy... there's a few rules that every hunter should know. Rule one: mind the muzzle. Rule number two: treat every gun as if it were loaded. Rule number three: beware of your target and what's behind it. And rule number four, the most important rule: you only aim to shoot, and you only shoot to kill. Understood? Y-Y-Yes, sir. Ryder, today's the day. I can feel it in my guts. They'll be back in a few hours for supper. Oh, he is old enough. Stubborn like his father. It seems all he wants to do is sing and play songs. He has such a hard time making friends. They never let him play any games. But why shouldn't he still believe in Santa? I have got to get the stove on, but first, the firewood. - Okay, bye now. - ...Board of Health has not yet lifted the water boil advisory for the county. After the tragic traffic collision just last month, industrial waste was feared to have contaminated local streams and river system. Health inspectors urged continued caution even though the Mayor issued a statement insisting that with the water freeze, there is no cause for concern until after the holiday season. And... Shhh. There. The nose, it's... it's so gross! Something... ate this. It's breathing. I think it's still alive. It should be me. Today is my day. Ryder... I'm proud of you. As you can see, life is very fragile. You see, son, in the circle of life and death... No. No! What... No, Ryder, run! Run! Run! Run! Help, Mom, you gotta help! Baby, Ryder, what's wrong? It's Tabby. We thought it was dead, but now, I think Dad is. No, you're not making any sense. Where is your father? We need to get your father help. No, we... we gotta go. We... we gotta tell everybody. This is not a game. No, honey, we need to find your father. Mom, watch out! Mom! Mom! Run! Run!
