The truck fuss didn't let me hear. I asked what was going on out there to astonish you so! - I'm enjoying the nature. - So! I didn't know enjoying the nature would upset you. Especially now that we've gone through the factory smoke! What's on your mind? Why don't you answer? Don't you like the small hills and the towering trees at queue in our honor? You know what? You're not really healthy. - I think you've a chip on your shoulder. - Have a chip on my shoulder?! Yep, wanna prove it? There's such a beautiful plain against your eyes, yet you don't see it! Such a beautiful plain, towering trees, nice-looking nature! You see now luminous and beautiful is that light orange color above there? - Do you know what that is? - Yep, I saw it. You're right. I should enjoy this nature too. - Bravo, it's never too late to mend! - Yes, that's really beautiful. You mean that orange mass? That's so picturesque! It's even tangible and palatable! You mean the one that's reddish? Yep! That's a wildflower! - No, that's a sheep being hanged! - Damn you! Don't insult, please! Why damn me? It's just a piece of sheep meat which is part of the nature, isn't it so? It's got a nice color too. I'm serious! - Crazy! - I think it's beautiful. A piece of red sheep meat with shaking white tail fats! I found it! I always chew a gum while driving. It both quenches and calms down. Here you are! One for each! - Thanks! - Welcome! - I was so thirsty. - And here's yours! It was a good suggestion! Here you are! I think we've come well so far. We'll get extra time before boarding. Our junk car is so cool! Isn't it so? - Our driver is cool as well. - Is he cool?! - I mean, he's a skilled driver. - Yep, he drives so fine! Yeah! What's up? You seem uneasy. No, it's nothing. I sometimes get stomachache. It's a result of working too much and smoking. My better half always nags me about visiting a doctor, but I don't have time. She's right! - You should see a doctor ASAP! - Here's the first turn. We'll get to Road 40 in ten minutes. Then we'll move to the airport directly! Perfect! Everything has been OK so far. What's that scar beneath your ear? I'd never seen it before. This? It's for a long time ago. It's the scar of Aleppo boil. It's from my childhood. I was 15-16 when infected with it. It was full of pus and for removing it, they pierced my ear so deeply. - This is the scar of it. - You should do electrotherapy. - It'd be removed easier with it. - Yep, I should do electrotherapy. Why don't you do it then? Are you afraid of it? No, I'm not in the mood for it. Many people have told me to do so. I'll do that after getting back from the Capital. Damn it! That's all we need! We're doomed if stuck here. I don't think the plane waits for us! Be right back! Go to the bushes. That'd be safer! Such beautiful flowers! They smell nice too. Chewing gum is stuck to the decayed tooth that annoys me so much. - You must fill it! - It's above there at right. Put this flower on your suit because of having toothache and helping me! Thank you! Here's a chic guy with flower on his suit! As if he wanna attend a wedding party! OK then! The way is unblocked! Sir! A cup of coffee milk, please! Sir! You stepped on my foot! Me?! Yes, it was my right foot. Exactly where it's got a... Excuse me! You know, I'm nearsighted. My eyesight number is 3. I'm so sorry! - It's OK! - Excuse me! - May I stub out my cigarette here? - Yes please! Sir! Yes? You stepped on my foot! Me?! Yes, it was my right foot. Exactly where it's got a corn! Seriously? I thought it was the left foot! Security Organization! Special Agent! I don't get it! Put down the money for the coffee milk and leave! Remember that you had two cups of coffee milk! Objection! Why is it so?! Get up! And at last, the suspects of the toilet-paper case were arrested. And all four of them confessed their wrongdoings clearly at once. Another success for the organization! Full stop! It's not a significant issue anyway. I told the boss about it immediately. Another anti-government organization was nipped in the bud once more. The Organization of... Security! - Yes? - Do you hear me? I'm completing the report of the toilet-paper case. I'll take it right now. That's not the case. It's over! I need you for what has happened recently. Candoo Restaurant Issue! Our agents arrested two persons at Candoo Restaurant 4 hours ago. Make your way to the Capital at 7 sharp next morning! Come from the usual way by car and plane! You and Coach should take one of them to the headquarters. Pull over, rascal! Our Coach is really a skilled driver. I'm also calling him "Coach"! I've heard you calling him so since morning. Why wouldn't you say that? All call him Coach in the organization. Since he always says, "When I was a coach..." - Coach for what? - I used to train cocks. - Seriously?! - Yep, fighting cocks! I used to do it for 8 years. Getting the cocks into fight all the day! My cocks always used to win in the matches. I had a team that none was match for it. But all of them got ill and died abruptly out of bad luck! First the light ones and then the heavy cocks! All of my champs died out of diarrhea. It was then that I was forced to be an agent of the Security Organization. What could I do? Diarrhea-infected fighting-cocks! - I'm so sorry! - No problem! It was the fault of Coach's driving! No, the problem is that I'm ticklish when I hear about the cocks. When I was a child, my bro always used to tickle me with a cock feather. He used to do it so much that I'd wet myself! I'm ticklish even now by hearing about cocks. It's a secret of nature. But we caught you well! I wasn't a cockfighting trainer. I was a catch wrestling coach! That's strange! - You said the plane would fly at 11:10? - Yes. - And the next plane? - Next morning at 6:20. Haven't you ever gone to the Capital by plane? No, I've always gone by train. Of course, not many times! By train?! What a disaster! It exhausts you so much by moving on and on! Yep, it's much easier. - I'll go this way next time. - Yeah, do that! - So, there's no flight in the afternoon. - No, there're just 2 flights a day. One is at early morning and the other is at about noon. Hope the flight wouldn't be delayed. I'd like to get to the Capital tonight and put an end to this story! We'd go to the headquarters and they'd free me by getting I've done no wrongs. Rest assured, we'll get on time! I trust in this junk car! So do us in our driver! Don't waste all of your praises. I'll drive in a little while. You'd see who the better one is! OK. Just be aware that I judge fully impartial! All right! What's that?! It's not a good time for such inconveniences! Let me take a look! - What's wrong with it? - Hold on, you nag so much! Wish we'd not praised you! It'd not be over tonight if it's broken. OK. Seems nothing is wrong with it. Everything is all right, but it makes a noise. We'll move on anyway! It seems that was close! Otherwise, it'd be so annoying. We'd be so distressed if we'd not get to the headquarters tonight. This issue has disturbed my life! Remember that it's a very important issue! Do the utmost attention! Sorry, seems it's not a good time. I'll get back later. No, you'd not get back again. I mean, no need to leave! So, there'd be no need to get back! You, I and Coach gotta talk about the case of Candoo Restaurant. The one about which I told you few minutes ago. Anyway, I've taken with me the report on the toilet-paper case. - If you wish to... - OK, put it on the desk! This case is over for the Organization. Be seated if you wish so! Be seated, so that I'd tell you about the case of Candoo Restaurant. It started today! I received this pocket about 11 which has been posted yesterday. It included this note too. Tomorrow, on 16th which is today, between 13:15-3:30 a key member... ...of an anti-government organization will go to Candoo Restaurant. This person and his organization are still unknown to Security Organization. Attached is the photo of the mentioned person. Even though it's an old photo, wish that it'd suffice. And wish it'd come in use if you'd like to know about him and the one... ...he's gonna meet at the restaurant. The rest is none of my concern. Here is the photo! You can take a look! We probed the photo, but didn't get anything. You might see hundreds of people alike him every day. But he's got several characteristics. The mustache, the glasses and... - Have a look! - Yes? What is it? Wanna say another accused one has committed suicide? We had enough as the fourth accused man of toilet-paper case escaped! No, it's not about committing suicide. An accused of Candoo Café objected and asked to be investigated here. He wanna be faced with the other one. Reassure him that he'd be faced with the other soon. But, in the headquarters! OK Sir! So! Where were we on? What could we do with this letter? We couldn't forget about it. So, our agents went to Candoo Restaurant on time and waited there. We gave each of them a photo of the suspect. The guy at the photo showed up at 13:20 sharp. Of course, he didn't resemble the photo completely. He was older and had dressed his hair in another style. But it was himself. No doubt, it was him! He sat at a table by the window. He ordered a glass of juice. Later, he took a cursory glance at the newspaper. He went to men's room then. Of course, we couldn't follow him in the men's room. Since the men's room at Candoo Restaurant has space for just one. Yes, such errors happen anyway. We can't do anything about it. He got out of men's room in two minutes, at 13:29 sharp. Making his way out among the tables, he stepped on a man's foot who... ...was sitting at the 3rd table at right. Of course, he went on without noticing. But the man condemned him for stepping on his foot. The man in the photo asked "Me?!" The other answered, "Yes!" "You stepped on my right foot. Exactly where it's got a corn!" He said sarcastically, "Seriously? I thought it was the left foot!" and left. Two agents followed him, so they'd seize anybody whom he might contact. But he contacted no one and was seized in front of Setareh Cinema. And about the other who's got a corn at his foot and would be the abettor! Of course, they might've encountered unexpectedly. He was also seized by another agent. What do you think it is? - Two small ovals. - And you? I also think they're two ovals. Yes, two ovals! Yes, they really can be two ovals. They can have no special notion. They've been drawn by the one with the corn at his foot in that restaurant. It can be supposed that he's drawn them just to pass his time. For example he could've drawn two circles, squares or any other shape. What anybody would do in leisure time. But it can be supposed vice versa too. I mean, these two ovals have a notion of which we're not aware for now. Let's go to the drawer! He did nothing special when he was seized. He just said, "I don't get it!" and "Objection!" It wasn't clear if his calmness was out of guilt or innocence. He did nothing special on the way to Security Organization. He just checked his watch while passing by Tamadon School. Our agent asked him if he had an appointment. He refused and said he'd checked his watch for no reason. He was taken to the Organization and led to the 3rd room. To avoid another story as that of the accused of toilet-paper case... ...they removed all his clothes and searched him carefully at first. There was nothing unusual in his pockets. Is his house been searched? Yes, very quickly! But nothing was found. He lives with his daughter who's a schoolgirl. His wife has died and he's not remarried. He's so calm and has never dealt with the Police or Security Organization. No acquaintance of him thinks he might do anything against the regime. I investigated and asked him to tell me the story two hours after he was taken. He told me all exactly as it had happened. We expected a lie in his words to get evidence against him. But he said everything in detail! What are these? Why did you draw them? - What do they mean? - Nothing, they're just two ovals. Two small ovals! Please don't say you suspect them! I draw them to pass the time. I could've drawn two circles instead. Or two squares, or any other shapes! It's not that easy! Even so simple, they can be the plan of an assassination or a sabotage. That's really funny! Sorry, but it seriously is funny. But... But how is it possible? I've nothing to do with politics. That's not right! No, it's not! It's not enough to say, "I've nothing to do with politics!" One would either agree with the regime or not! If he wouldn't agree, it means that he disagrees! It's not right to say, "I've nothing to do with politics"! Did you tell him that he should be taken to the headquarters tomorrow? Yes, you two will take him. The best way to get there is going by car and the plane. - Leave early morning at 7, but... - The microfilms are ready, Sir! - I bet it's gonna rain! - Rain?! - Yep, rain is predicted! - It's ridiculous, how you got it? With such sun that's burning us? There's not even a cloud in the sky! The weather is humid. That's not really natural now, is it? Yes, I think that Coach is right. Such heat and humidity isn't so natural. I think it's gonna rain. - Chewing gum? - No, thanks! The previous one troubled my tooth. The tooth that is... I know, the one above and next to last at the right. I heard it when you told my friend. But he accepts whatever you offer him. You know, we're friends for long time. We've lived together for some years. We finally became colleagues! Such nice years they were! You must know that there's a special philosophy for those who... ...accept to service at Security Organization. According to this philosophy, people are not divided into... ...binary oppositions of good and bad or decent and indecent! According to this philosophy, they don't categorize people according to... ...the unreal and null differences inherited to us from the past. The investigation agent of Security Organization accepts just 1 difference. People are either supporters or objectors to the regime! This simple notion is so precious both to Security Organization and you all! The secret of survival, key to success and inner peace for the regime is... ...provided by this easy categorization. The less you think, the more you'd be successful and devoted to the regime. Your first enemy is thinking! Don't ever give in to it! I'll repeat and emphasize once more! This is the only notable difference for an agent of Special Organization! Being a supporter of regime or not! People are either supporters or objectors to the regime! You must always bear this key point in mind. Do you agree to listen to music? The music is gonna be played from now to 10:30. Yes! Wow! I love such music with fast tempo. - But I don't really like such music. - Bravo to express your idea bravely! I do agree with you. What kinda music do you like? Traditional old music. Bravo! The music of the past is better! When do you think we'd get to the Capital? The plane will take off at 11:10. The flight would last an hour. We'll have another hour way by car too. We should get about 13:15. That's perfect! We'll get soon enough that I could end the issue with headquarters tonight. Then I'll invite you and Coach to a nice restaurant! Capital is excellent at night! I'd like all 3 of us have fun tonight. So, you're sure the headquarters will set you free so soon. Yes! As I've not committed any crime in my opinion or theirs to deserve a penance. It's impossible for the other whom I don't know and must face to prove his lies. I'll shut his mouth! This issue will be over tonight. As soon as we get to the headquarters! My wife has asked me to buy her some underclothes from the Capital. I saw its advertisement in paper. It must be in my pocket if not lost. - Woe betide me if I'd forget! - Rest assured, I'll remind you! Thank you! What's going on? - What's wrong with this junk? - What's up again?! Damn! Let me see what's with it! It made me bored. Damn luck! Being delayed on and on! Hurry up! The plane would leave! You can totally forget about the plane now! What do you mean? Don't get mad, it's a piece of cake! The carburetor has failed. Damn it! - Are you sure it's the carburetor? - Yep! The first noise was of it too, but it wasn't clear then. Now it's clear that there's no carburetor anymore! Watch our passenger! I'll take a look too! Yes, its float is broken! That's really interesting! What should we do now? - What's your idea? Just sitting there? - What do you expect me to say? I guess I must be the most disturbed one, isn't it so? Stop! - Do you need any help? - The carburetor has failed. - It might've been flooded. - Let's go, it's late! - OK, hold on! - He became a mechanic again! - You wanna mess with their car? - Coming! - I'm leaving! - Push it, it might start! - Get in! - Coming! - A car is coming! - The airport! Nobody would pick three men with mustache! - We're so unlucky! - A car! The airport, Sir! Stop! No! It's your fault, they're scared to pick us because of your shape! A truck! - The airport! - You step back! - The airport! - Stop! Excuse me, Sir! You go on the airport direction? - Yep! - Please take us there too! It's an emergency. It'd be appreciated. - Two of you get in! - But we're three, our car broke there. - Just two of you! - I'll answer if you were seized. - Come on, you're too serious! - OK, get going! - I got exhausted! - The trouble-free trip! - That's just my luck! - Don't worry, it could be worse. For example, crushing into a truck or falling into the gorge! Let's all 3 of us get in! It's both friendly and secure. Who's gonna give this good news to Boss? You do that! I'm not in the mood for it! All right! - Yes please? - Hi, it's Coach. - I wanna speak to Boss. - Hold the line! OK! What's up? Who's speaking? - Hi, it's Coach! - What's wrong? Haven't you got to the Capital yet? Has he escaped? No, he's here. Rest assured! I'm 2 kilometers from the airport. We lost the flight. The car carburetor failed. - He'll give a roar now! - Damn it! What would I say to the headquarters? They'll be waiting for you tonight. - I should call them. - It's not our fault, but just our luck! - Reprove the transportation unit! - Where are you exactly now? As I said, 217th KM and 2 kilometers from the airport in a phone booth. - What would you do now? - We'll find a garage and fix the car. We'll board at 6:20 next morning. Unless you command something else. No, do that! What should we do with our passenger till tomorrow? What's idea about committing him to Security Organization office here? No, don't even think about it! Neither Security Organization office there nor the Police! None of them should get involved. Got it? Yes, but we can't move him with us from one garage to another! - We should keep him somewhere. - Find somewhere there! Damn it! There should be hotels there. Find a 3-bed room! Not at ground floor that'd let him escape from the window. OK, I hope we can find one. You must find one! There are many hotels there. Pick the most secure room! Call me then! Who should stay with the passenger and who should go for the garage? That's not important. I won't interfere in that. OK, bye! He got very angry. Of course he would! You thought he'd reward you? - So, who'd go for the garage? - You mean, who'd do the hard job! - Obviously, nobody wants that! - So, let's roll the dice! - OK! - Come on then! - Pairs or not? - Not! - You lost! Four pairs! - Damn it! So, you'll go for the garage and other stuffs and I'll stay with our friend! I should first go for hotel. A 3-bed room with a separate toilet which would be at upper floors! I'd not walked so much in years! Wish Coach could take the room sooner, or it'd be ultimate bad luck! It depends! I don't think it's got to do with luck. We want a room with special features as Boss said, is that right? Hey, boy! Your money! Coach puts off doing a thing! Two more hotels are left. He might be able to find a room. I could do with a cold drink! It's just the ticket after such a long walk and hot weather. Damn it! The car broke down exactly when we were arriving. I'm not feeling well. Do you wanna go to that café? I think I'd get a cold coke. No, Coach would have to look for us everywhere if he gets back. He's coming at last! I finally found one! It's got only two beds, but he said he'd add another. It's large and has the bathroom and toilet. It's at 7th floor. Let's go then! I'm so thirsty and need a drink. May I? Yes please! We got here at last! We were lucky, as the man said it was vacated half an hour ago. I'll come to pick you at 2 sharp! - Get going, honey! - Do we surely go to the movies today? Yes honey. Get going! - Bye daddy, see you at 2 o'clock! - Goodbye! - Are you upset? - No, it's nothing. You'd better ask about our ideas. We might like to drink something else. Have it! It's better than anything else! Here you are! - I don't like it! - You... Call Boss! It's hard to call from here, as you'd have to dial the call center. It's not needed that the hotel staffs know we're Security Organization agents. OK, I'll call him. I'll call you too from the garage. Bad luck! If I'd just guessed the dice rightly, I'd rest at ease now! You dodged it, lucky man! Excuse me, I gotta go quickly. - It's getting late! Bye! - You spilled all of it! What are we waiting for? We're waiting for Coach's call. It's 20 minutes that he's gone. He must've not been able to find a garage yet. Yes, and we have to wait. I got tired of idleness and waiting. It gets on my nerves! What's your idea? What about playing a game to kill the time? Playing cards or chess! Or even something else! - Not cards, but I agree with chess! - Well! With pleasure! You think we'd find chess here? Probably! We'll get it somewhere else if they don't. Checkmate! Bravo! You play very well. No. I was just lucky! Where are you? Did you find the garage? Which garage? Who's speaking?! Hello? Who are you, Sir? - What do you want, ma'am? - What do you want?! - Which number did you ask for? - Isn't it room No. 707? - No! - What's its number then? It wasn't him. It's not important. He must be looking around. He'll finally call. No need to get worried. I didn't think you'd play so well. I've not played for a long time. I've totally forgotten it. I'll lose on and on if it goes on so. What are you doing? Seems you're figuring out a plan. No, I'm just playing! - Yes? - I'm at the garage. We're gonna tow the car. I'll call you as I get back. OK, we're playing chess. I've been unlucky so far. - What is the fuss for? - It's obvious! I'm in a garage, not a hospital! Play your game! OK, call me again! OK, I moved mine! You're worrying me! This game seems so dangerous to me. No, it seems hard to win this time! My state is getting worse on and on. Don't exaggerate! Why so desperate? You're just a little bit poor with pawns. Anyway, you should know that nothing is predictable in chess and love! You'd either win or lose in the last moment. In love, YES! But I don't think so about chess. I think I'd better play with all forces. I might find an escape route. Bravo! That's a brave decision! And now, a counter-attack! Attention! The enemy is trying desperately. First for saving himself and second, for changing the situation to his benefit! I'll receive him warmly! Here you are! I'm curious to see your reaction. Don't rush! I have my own method. I'd just reassure you that my move would surprise you! I'm really happy about the trust you have in yourself! Looking forward to see the result! - Cigarettes? - Yes! Even though I think you don't smoke nice cigarettes. Here you are! - Thanks! - Welcome! So, I think it'd be possible to move this pawn forward. What do you think? - You won it! - I won a game at last! Come in! We'd either draw or it'd end in 4-2! I think I'd put you into checkmate for the 4th time if I keep calm. How come? You seem surprisingly calm to me. No, I'm not calm at all. I wanna win this game obstinately. That's why I rush in moving! Any problem? No, I think you don't play so fast. You're an expert! You can teach many ones. It must be Coach. Hello? What did you do with the carburetor? - It's not going on well. - What do you mean? It's got into trouble. It will take time to fix it. Other cars are waiting too. It's not just the carburetor that's broken. The valves and the brake should also be regulated. - It's got a lot to be fixed. - That's so ridiculous! There's no other choice. I should be here all the night. They're so busy and work even at nights. I'll come to hotel by car then go directly to the airport. Fixing won't be over before 5 a.m. It's ridiculous! We're having a run of bad luck. Do something about it! I couldn't get else's time. It's not my fault. - What would we do now? - What would you do? I should stay here, as they'd not finish it till tomorrow if I don't watch them. - Think about what to do! - OK, don't forget to call Boss! It's a nice weather. Coach is playing dumb with us! All the night for fixing the car! Whose turn is it? Yours! I wanna play while standing. Would you get upset? - No, why would I? - I can't sit anymore. I'm so angry that I cannot stick to the chair any longer! Damn it! I understand you. Rest assured! I should use the toilet now. Get up! You should stand in front of the door. Since I don't like you to get me into trouble! Get up! Don't keep quiet! Speak! Say something that I could hear. - What would you like me to say? - Don't you have anything on mind? Go ahead! For example, sing a carol! Sing a carol? Which carol? I don't know, one of those they teach at school. I'd sing it wrongly. I don't know well enough. No problem. You're not gonna perform at concert. Murmur the melody of it! Go ahead! All right! Hey, it's enough! I was inspired by a perfect idea. - Has the toilet been inspiring to you? - Yep! - I always make the best decisions here. - What's that decision? A tour in the city! What's your idea? I think it's perfect! I was waiting to hear that it seemed suspicious to you! Suspicious?! Why? Just so! It's an interesting decision and that's why it seems strange. But it's a piece of cake! I just offered a suggestion. It's OK if you'd agree. If not, we'll sit and play chess again. - I agree! - With chess? - No, with touring in the city! - Let's go then! But I should tell you something first. I can't live on here in this prison. I'm really distressed now that Coach gave us the bad news. That's why I suggested touring. But you must know I'm responsible for you as long as we're together. So, I should make sure that you don't intend to deceive me. Otherwise, the idea of friendly tour would be over! - No, I'm not gonna deceive you at all. - That's fine! Yet let me say that I've won the first prize at shooting 4 times so far. So, beware that you can't go far if you aim to! No, I don't aim at anything! All right! We won't talk about it anymore. I think we talked too much. I'd take back my word if you don't like touring in the city. Since I can't handcuff you and carry you from a place to another. Why are you insisting so much? - I'd tell you if I didn't like it. - OK. The tour duration is an hour. It should be limited. I think that an hour would suffice. - Yes, it would. - OK then, let's go! The first thing to do is going to the barber's directly! Barbering our hair would make us refreshed! What's your idea about a special trim? You didn't say whether or not you wanted a special trim! All right! Your insistence leaves no other choice! Excellent! Be careful anyway! You know, I've got thin skin. As thin as cigarette paper! It bleeds with any slight issue and I really hate it! Rest assured! I'm so skilled. Special trim is only in my power! Seriously? Give it a go then! Oh, it's so hot! Yes, it's very hot. No, it's more than "Very!" It's excessively hot! Then wipe "Very" and write "Excessively" instead! I think you'd better remove your jacket. You'd sweat too much with it. Remove your jacket! You'd sweat too much with it. You'd get too upset if you sweat. And if you're upset, there'd be no use for the special trim! Your friend is better to get along with. Look at him! He's removed his coat and is sitting there so relaxed! Sir! Your jacket is so restrictive. Don't you wanna take it off? Get closer! I wanna tell you a secret. Of course, you shouldn't tell anybody about it. It's said that I've got a small pistol in my pocket. That's why I don't wanna remove my jacket. Got it or would you like me to show you? No! Not at all! No need to remove your jacket. It's fine the very same way! You know, special trim is so much better with a jacket on. His face was so funny! He stopped chattering when he got I had a pistol. Yes, he was talking too much. But it wasn't a bad barber shop on the whole. He's made the Aleppo boil scar under your ear bleed. Seriously? I'd forgotten I had that scar. He was such a chatterbox that totally distracted us. I think you wouldn't come to know if he'd cut your head too! The good thing about me is that my blood clots so fast. Ok, let's cut to the chase! The tour in the city! - We've got exactly one hour. - Not fully! We should subtract 20 minutes of being at the barber's of that. - Is that right? - No! I don't like to trick. Our tour begins from now on. - It's 14:05 now. - All right. - So, we've got time to 15:05. - Ok, let's begin our tour in the city! - No! - Why not? It's so easy to say we'd begin the tour. But it's not that easy. Do you have a special suggestion? Where do you want us to go? I don't know any special place. What would I say? I've just passed by here few times several years ago. - So, we'll go ahead just by chance! - OK. It's the best solution to it. We'll go to the streets direction. We'll keep going behind people, as if we're in the sea. We'll entrust ourselves to the water flow! Bravo! I really liked this suggestion! Did you like it? We'll go ahead then! I don't either know this city well. Let's see what would come about! I was at Pishraft Bar since 11 till Coach got there. He told me how he drank his orange juice and left there quickly. - Hello! - Hi. - How are you? - Not too bad. - Can I take your order? - I'll have a drink. - What would you like? - A cold drink, no difference. - All right. - Thanks! Speak! I got tired of waiting. I had carrot juice on and on. I wanted to stop drinking it, since I'd got stomachache. But I didn't wanna leave my post under any circumstances. I understand you, dude! You obviously can't use the toilet on and on when you're on the post. Go ahead! Don't rush! Let me have a drink and then talk. In detail! I can do and eat all I wish now that I'd be free till tomorrow 5 a.m. Not carrot or orange juice! Yes, you can have all you wish, but not me! It's just the beginning of my job! You know, I got here so much sooner than the time I should. As I said, it's for 1.5 hours that I'm waiting at Pishraft Café. I drove the entire road so swiftly. Our speed was 110 km/h. It was easy to make it 130-140 km/h, but Boss had taken all into account. We mustn't have gone faster than 110. We had to be at 214 KM on time. Did you get that I overtook your car about Road 40? Of course I did! Damn your driving! I was close to put you to death! You were lucky I let you pass on time! So, we should wait for the rest of it. You'll make 2 calls as planned. Then they'll start touring in the city. It's here that I come to the scene. You'll play the game too, but in silence! You know that, don't you? Yep, but my pistol wouldn't keep silent if needed. Everything will go on well now. They should play chess, or if the guy wouldn't know playing it... ...they should talk about the weather. Investigator is waiting for my call and it's the time to call him now. The sensitive moment is when Investigator suggests touring in city. We should hope he'd not reject! What if he'd suspect or wouldn't be in the mood for touring? Don't worry, Investigator is so smart! He knows what to do very well. You should've seen him since morning. He's been perfect! He proceeds little by little, in a way that the guy wouldn't even suspect! Suspecting the trap he's fallen into! I gotta go calling. - Yes? - I'm at the garage. We're gonna tow the car. I'll call you as I get back. What is the fuss for? It's obvious! I'm in a garage, not a hospital! Play your game! Everything is all right. They're playing chess. - What a plot! - Boss is so intelligent and perfect! Sorry for being late! The microfilms are to blame for it! - So, where did we get to? - The plane! As you said, you'd told the suspect of Candoo Café that... ...you'd transfer him to the headquarters tomorrow. You also added that we gotta take him to the Capital by car and plane. Yep, that's what I told the suspect. But it's a little bit different for you! You'll make your way to the Capital next morning at 7, but shouldn't get there. It's a piece of cake! You won't get to the Capital. You won't board the plane at all, since your car will break down. At 214 KM of Chehel Road, the carburetor of your car will fail. Exactly according to the plot! You're gonna get the plot in detail. Feel free to ask questions if you find any ambiguities. But first, I must add something to what I was saying before being interrupted. The first suspect who was the man in the photo is also arrested. But there's a small difference about it. He wasn't alive, yet dead! While our agents were seizing the first, two other agents followed the second. As it wasn't clear if the one he stepped on was the one he wanted to contact. They really might've faced by accident and he'd aimed to contact someone else. So, we shouldn't have arrested him there and we didn't! Bad luck! My bad luck! Another bad luck was that we found no evidence in his pockets. Neither in his pockets nor in his heels! Not an ID or a driving license. Nothing! - So, we even don't know who he is? - No! I think there's no need to remind that I've not told him about the guy's death. On the contrary, I pretended that he'd been arrested. I even told him he'd provided us with interesting reasons and evidence. He listened to me calmly and asked which reasons and evidence I meant. As you'd be done with investigation, I'll ask for you at my room to be faced. I was negotiating thoroughly with the headquarters on the phone at the time. I wanted to make him speak in our usual way, but more masterly! You know what I mean! But the headquarters disagreed and ordered to do a new plot on suspect. - A new plot?! - Yes! The headquarters is the planner of this plot. I really don't know who the original creator of it is. It might be the result of the work of a leading group of experts. Or a computer might've planned it. I don't know! I just know we gotta perform this plot which is a masterpiece so carefully! A perfect and flawless plot! This plot is being emerged from a physical property. Like suddenly putting a bottle that'd been in hot water in the cold water! Our suspect was drinking coffee in Candoo Café at ease... ...when he was suddenly arrested. We don't know if he's guilty or not. Then he found himself at Security Organization at once. It's exactly as taking him from hot weather to the cold all of a sudden. It's like putting a hot thing in ice! A question is vexing him now: "What'd occur to him at Security Organization?" Plot of moving him to the headquarters is kinda temperature reducer to him. But the friendship made on the way increases his temperature again. It gives him some hope, as if nothing has happened. He'll get spirited again! But he'd get into the cold by arriving to the headquarters and being received! The entire hope of the plot success is in such change of state! Hot! Cold! The bottle would break at last! It would fall into pieces! The plot is gonna perform this test on the suspect. So, as he gets to the headquarters in 2 days, or maybe even sooner... ...a crack would be developed in him. Much info would come out of that crack in 1st investigation or even without it. The info that we couldn't get from him in any other ways! - I just got it, that's perfect! - That's really wonderful! Happy to hear that! No need to explain that it'd be a great success for all of us if the plot works. You know what I mean! Security Organization is very well at appreciating those who're useful for it. - We'll do our best! - Yes! I must stress that the plot success depends on being performed well. Nothing noticeable must be in it. Everything should be so plain! The plot is not as a storm or tornado to ruin everything. It should rather be as a spring gentle rain that penetrates the earth placidly. It should rather be as a spring gentle rain that penetrates the earth placidly. You're responsible for the most important part of the plot! You should pretend as a simple agent. Pay attention! He shouldn't realize that you're an investigator. He should think of you as a simple agent like Coach. You should create an atmosphere in which the suspect feels full accord. You should become exactly the person who you pretend you are. Get help from your creativity. Do upon you perception! Another agent would watch you too. We'll be the winner in any way! As even if he'd escape, it proves he's guilty. Of course, he'd not make it! So, he'd have to open his beautiful mouth for us! This is a perfect plot! So, it's time for a cold drink! We've got 3 minutes to the end of our touring. You agree? Yes, absolutely! Sandwich makes you thirsty. - But it's on me this time! - OK, I'll have an iced coffee. Sir! A juice and an iced coffee! - Please be quick! - All right! Daddy, where are you going? I gotta go see a friend. I'll come to pick you at 2 sharp! - Do we surely go to the movies tonight? - Yes honey. Get going! - OK daddy. Bye! - Goodbye sweetie! Entering Candoo Restaurant, you must pick a table at the end and beside WC. You must stretch your leg in a way that one would step on it without noticing. You should order a coffee milk and start drawing on your cigarette paper. You can draw whatever you wish. The guy should show up between 13:15 and 13:30. If he'd not get till 13:30, either something might've happened... ...or he might've found the place insecure. Therefore, you may leave. If he'd come, he'd step on your foot and you should object. - Sir! - Yes? - You stepped on my foot! - Me?! Yes, it was my right foot. Exactly where it's got a corn! - Seriously? - Yes! I thought it was the left foot! Then you should wait till the guy exits café. You should get to him in 2 minutes at the first red traffic light. But you shouldn't show any acquaintance. He'd tell you the place of next meeting quietly while crossing the street. The main meeting we've been looking forward to since long time ago. - Any questions? - Objection! - Get up! - Why?! You have an appointment? No, I just wanted to see what the time was. - Please take me to your chief! - Sure! Waiting! Your abettor has said nice things. What do you have to say? Abettor?! Which abettor? - What do you mean? - You know what I mean very well! The one who signaled you at Candoo Restaurant. Which signal?! I don't get what you say! Please... Remove your right shoe and sock, please! Take them off! Yes, that's right! That's right. You've got a corn on right foot. Please make me face with your other accused person. So, everything would be proved to you. I don't know him! You'll be faced with him. Next morning, at the headquarters! His words were so interesting that the headquarters will pursue this directly. So, you'll go to the Capital tomorrow. Why Security Organization? Has he confessed? No, that's not possible! They've been too kind. What's the matter? Do they wanna strike abruptly? The guy might've got evidence. Or he might have not! How is it possible? Security Organization! Their best gift is death. So! The tour time is over! I'm saying it to you, as I respect what we agreed on. I don't like you to think that I'd take advantage of the situation. Don't think about it! Nobody would reprimand you. It's just me who's responsible for this touring, you've got no responsibility. I didn't notice when it got 15:10. - Can I have the bill, Sir? - Please bring me the bill, Sir! May I? No! It's on me this time! With your permission, of course! Excuse me! It's OK, as you're insisting. All right, we can go. I'm ready! Go ahead! I wanna suggest you something! What's your idea about extending our tour for one more hour? - I've no objection. - OK, it's extended for another hour. - All right! - So, where do we go? I'm at your command. We'd walk if you agree. Otherwise, we'd get back to hotel. Whatever you wish! OK, we'll go on walking. I've another suggestion too. What's that? Today, I've become a suggestion machine that suggests on and on! - What's your suggestion? - Don't address me so formally! Address me more friendly! I don't like that formal way at all. - OK, I accept your suggestion. - That's it! - Let me help you, mother! - God bless you, son! - Any problem with it? - No problem! Let me help you, mother! I'll take these for you. Thank you so much, son! You're nice young guys. I was wearing out. I've got old. I used to carry twice such weight in the past. But I've got no more power for it. That's it anyway! - What's this, mother? - It's wool, son. I spin it to yarn. I knit some stuffs and sell them. - You do it by yourself, mother? - No son, my daughter helps me. I've got weak eyesight. You good guys are not from here, are you? No mother, my friend and I have come on an excursion. You did very well! You should travel a lot as long as you're young, especially with friends. A good friend is better than everything! It's obvious that you're good friends. God bless you! Cherish each other! - The lifetime passes too soon! - Thanks! So, we're leaving. - Would you excuse us, mother? - Goodbye! - Bye! - Take care! God bless you! These neighborhoods are so different with the downtown. They're poor neighborhoods with tight alleys and old houses. No need to explain it to me! I was born in such neighborhood and was raised in such a place too. I really like to return to a neighborhood like them and recall my childhood. - Yep, childhood was a distinct world! - Yeah, I had many friends then. We were a flock for which nobody could be a match! We were such handfuls! All the alleys were our kingdom! We always used to ring the bells and run away! Once one of them ran after us and caught me and another boy. He imprisoned us at his basement and called for our mothers. We couldn't escape there despite all our efforts. Yet my mother came and rescued us. And what a rescue it was! I was hit so badly that I got injuries for a whole week! I understand you. I'd also been hit by my mother and I know how it felt! But I wasn't much the same as you. I used to keep to myself. I always liked to be a pilot, but my mother wanted me to be a doctor. And I finally became none! I didn't used to play in the alley. - I used to study most of the time. - I guessed that! How did you guess it? You don't know me yet! Just like this! - Why didn't you become a pilot? - I don't know, I just didn't! It might wonder you, but I still can't believe it. Why? I'm 41, married and have 13 years of work experience. - I didn't get when all these happened! - The lifetime passes too soon. Yep, too much! You start with a handful of hopes, but fail at the very first one! My father wished I'd buy him a house. He always used to say he liked to die at his own house. - Did you finally get him a house? - No, he died at the house he'd rented. We were so immersed in talking that might've gone right under the train! We were lucky that it wasn't moving so fast. Oh, a football! - What's your idea about kicking it? - Not bad! - Pass it to me stealthily! - Have it! - Pass it! - Step away! Pass it to me! Goal! - Excellent, Sir! - That was perfect! It was my 3rd or 4th for kicking football. I kicked by chance, but it worked! That's him! I say for his nose! He's the halfback of Ra'ad team. No, you know nothing! He's the left-back of Toufan team. - I know him! - What are they saying?! - I know him too! - I want an autograph! - What?! - Please don't reject me! All right, but... Have you got a pen? I don't usually give people an autograph! - This time I do just for your sake! - Hurray! It was perfect, Sir! I could do with swimming if it was another circumstance. - Yes, but it's not so now! - It's already nice! Watching the sea, the waves and the sea foam! And these children! It's a scene of life, even if we wouldn't like it. So warm, simple and sincere! Forget about it! I've decided to go to the water so. - What's your idea? - Perfect! Let's go! People must be laughing at us! - Something got into my foot! - Huh? Something got into my foot! I guess it is a thorn. Yeah, it's a thorn. - Do you want me to remove it? - No! It's so little! Let's go! Ouch! - You see? I shot exactly at the target! - Bravo, that was perfect! - Here is your prize! - You won! Give it a try! It was a piece of cake as you saw. - No! - It's a piece of cake! No, I'm not really good at shooting. Let's go! What would you do with your prize? You'd take it for your little daughter? No, I won't take it for my little daughter as I've got none! We don't have a kid yet. We've decided so for now. What's your idea about giving it to your daughter? - You've got a daughter. - Yep! What's she doing now? She's not worried, is she? - I don't know. - She'd go to a friend's or relatives'. No, she won't go anywhere. You can call your fiancée for sending your daughter to her. So, you'd not be worried about your daughter. No, I don't have a fiancée. - There's no need to call anybody! - OK! - It's so beautiful, isn't it? - Yes, very much! That's so interesting! It's nice! OK, let's go! Here you are, little girl! It's yours! Thank you! - What do you think of having juice? - I agree. I'm so thirsty. Two glasses of juice, please! Thanks! That was so enjoyable, but honestly a little bit scary! - Were you seriously scared? - Yep, I'm afraid of heights. That's funny! Thank you! - Let it be on me! - No! - Please! - Don't mention it! Here you are! Thanks! I'd not done so in years! We mingled with children! - Yep! - It was so enjoyable to me. Ready? - Hey, what are you doing? - Hold on! I wanna give you this photo, in memory of our tour in the city. What's your idea? - One for each, please! - OK. - You took two, right? - Yes! - Here you are! - Thanks! Look at me! I look like a retarded guy! - How cute she is! - Who? She? Yep! I didn't get what she was laughing at! I can't place it in my wallet. I'm afraid it'd be folded. - How dark it is here, guys! - Don't be scared! - Where's here? - It's the Wonderland! Didn't you see the signboard? - It's so airless here. - Yeah. It's an interesting trick! Pay attention! Dear visitors! Please go to exit door at once! The machines have got out of hand due to a technical problem. They might be life-threatening. Seems it's a critical condition. Give me your hand for not losing each other! Please keep calm! Move to exit door calmly and orderly! Don't jostle, please! It's the last warning! Dear visitors! Please don't stop and go to exit door immediately! Oh, my God! Visiting the Wonderland ended badly. But I like you to know that the tour was so enjoyable to me! Thank you so much for it! Attention! You've got into the exit door! Visiting the Wonderland is over. Please excuse us for this joke! I got too exhausted! - It was a nice tour, wasn't it? - Yeah, it was so wonderful. Why are you gazing at that picture? Does it get something interesting? No, I'm thinking about those who are on the ship. The time has stopped for them. They'd neither go down, nor would they go up. - Whose work is that picture? - It's got a signature. But I can't read it. Our touring in the city was really fantastic. Tell me who suggested it! You own me a "Bravo" or not? Yep! It's strange! I don't get what's with this shoelace. It unties on and on! - Yesterday at Candoo Restaurant... - I'm still waiting for your "Bravo!" Your suggestion about the tour in the city was really perfect. We got refreshed. We got a tour. We went to the sea. We played football. At the Amusement Park... We put ourselves in danger together in the Wonderland. It was very nice! Bravo! Seriously bravo to you! I wanna do a crossword puzzle now. Let me know if you need help! OK! I'll let you know if I'd stuck with it. What is it?! Nothing! It was a mosquito. I wanted to hunt it by spit! But I couldn't. Mosquito's being makes no difference as I think we've got no time to sleep. - Coach would get back soon. - Yep, it's almost morning. Damn! You lost all the opportunities. Incompetent! You just had to make your mind in a moment, but postponed it on and on! You were sure you'd escape on the way when you were told that... ...you were gonna be transferred to the Capital. But you didn't seize such opportunities! What if it's just a trick? They might have no evidence. The guy might've escaped. He might not been arrested at all. Then, your escape would be the best evidence. Investigator might not be alone. But the contrary is also possible. You had so many golden opportunities. At the train station! At the barber's! At the time of touring! At the park! You lost all those golden opportunities as they seemed too easy. You must make your mind! I don't know why I thought I'd not locked the door. How's the crossword puzzle going on? Something is getting on my nerve at 4th column. The flower that grows in the sky! I can't figure it out. You try your best! I'll let you know if I find it. Everything has gone well so far. The plot has been performed point by point. What a nice plot! It was worth the trouble. Of course, it was easier to investigate him in a way that would be beaten up! But performing this plot is more agreeable. I should've become another person. Such ridiculous actions! I did such actions that I'd never done before! But he didn't make a move! Does it mean he's innocent? It's happened before that we arrest an innocent person, but nothing is clear. He might've thought that it wouldn't be possible to run. Or he might've seen the other agent. I really love to know how the plot has affected him. About the impact of things we did. The tour and the friendly talks! I did my best. The Organization must get it! It wasn't an easy job. This plot took our characters from both of us. For me it was consciously and for him unconsciously. He'd surely think so if he's been playing roles. He might've seriously trusted me. Would he be too stupid?! Sometimes, I like him. No, I feel something else. But, pay attention! The rival shouldn't be underestimated. The worst a Security Organization agent would do is underestimating the rival. I must be so watchful while losing myself in the plot. That's what a perfect plot is! It's like stabbing him in heart with a dagger while talking to him so friendly. In a way that he'd not even get how he was stabbed! Did you find the flower that grows in the sky? No, I was gonna pack it in! But I wanna think about it again. Yep, it must be interesting. But it's just over my head! I used to blow my own trumpet in doing crossword puzzles! But we'll surely find and recall it in a moment we don't even think about it! Yep, but I've recalled something else which doesn't let me go on thinking. - Something else?! - Yeah! Remember the thorn I got in my foot at the beach when we were running? Yep! Why didn't we think of it sooner?! It wasn't on my mind while touring, but I've got pain since we returned to hotel. - It might be poisonous. - That's not important, I can stand it. No, I'll fix it now! You shouldn't bear the pain. I think I have a pin. Let me check! Yep, I've pinned 2 at back of my jacket collar, but we need something else too. Yes please? Excuse me, we need a little bit oil and some absorbent cotton. - Anything wrong? - No! - We stepped on thorns at the sea. - I'll send them to you right now. Thanks! Ready? Ouch! Yes? I've taken the absorbent cotton for you. Thank you! - Seems you're gonna do an operation! - Rest assured, it's a piece of cake! Remove your right shoe and sock! This is exactly what Boss told me last night. For now... Forget about Boss! You hold this pin! You'll see how interesting it is. We'll remove the thorns one by one. Turn the light, so that the light wouldn't bother my eyes. So! We gotta get dressed gradually. Coach will show up soon. It's not possible to stand a closed window all the time. Yep, I also wanted to say so for awhile, but I was uncertain about it. Why?! You should've said that. You'd get mad in such weather! I'd not thought about opening the window. - It's gently raining. - Seriously?! Coach was right then! This rain is announcing his arrival. He's arrived before. What's the time? My watch has stopped working. It's 4:50. So, Coach must show up now. Yep! We'll get together again! Like the beginning of our trip! What do you think about singing a carol? Yeah, I got it! I'll stand at the door and murmur something. No need to murmur anything. Just talk to me! I think we've said everything. What else can we talk about? Open the door! Open the door! Do you hear me? Open the door! Don't think about running! Perish the thought about running! Did you hear me? It's too late! Get back here! I told you to get back! It's too late to run away! Get back! Do we surely go to the movies tonight? Get back here! Your number is up! Don't act as the tightrope walkers! Now, I know you're guilty and aren't the naïve person you pretended to be. Get back here! You proved you were guilty! Get back here! Don't look at me like that! Do you hear the bell toll? We don't need to make a fuss in the hotel. Come here by yourself! Coach will arrive now. You know that you've got no way to escape. Don't make me shoot at you! Since you'd be done if I shoot at any part of your body! Dahila! Dahila! It's the word we were searching for! The 4th column! The flower that grows in the sky! Remember? We found it at last! Yep, we did it! I couldn't betray him! I couldn't! If he'd not confessed with his escape at the last moment! If I didn't know whether he was guilty or not! Then I might not get this crack and crumble inside me! But now, I know that he's guilty. He proved it with his escape and I'm responsible for his confession. The role I played was fruitful. That was why I couldn't betray him. Since it was my humanity that made him confess. It was my humanity! I pretended to be a human and having a heart with my friendly behaviors. I couldn't betray him! I put my entire strength in performing this thorough and flawless plot! I was a friend to him. I couldn't betray him! I already am a friend to him! All the scenes of our tour are still calling to my mind. I removed the thorns of his foot and rubbed oil on it. I did the 4th column of our crossword puzzle. Dahlia! Dahlia! The flower that grows in the sky! How could I betray him? How?! Run! The plot was performed perfectly! It had no flaws except that it turned against me all of a sudden. This is the scorpion suicide! Run! Coach will be here now. I beg you to run! Run! Hurry up! Run or I'd shoot at you! I'm ordering you! Open the door! He's knocking at the door! Run! Run! Damn you! Run! Coach is knocking at the door! Run! Damn you! Open the door! Run! He's knocking at the door! Run! There's no plot without a flaw while there's no crime without evidence! There surely would be a trace! We'd anticipated all the details, so that the plot would be flawless. But there was a flaw in our calculation. Something was wrong with it. I don't know what it was. Coach was just staring at me. Was that really me? The Special Investigator and the regime trustee?! The one who served the regime with such prejudice?! Was that me who was telling the accused man to run? Coach couldn't get what was with me. He didn't know the regime was no longer as before in my heart and conscience. He didn't know my heart was occupied by the man who was on the cornice. He didn't know that he and I were friends. A tour in the city and a tour in life had linked me and him together. It was what we'd not anticipated. There was a flaw in the plot. There is a flaw in the regime! We were making a mistake. A mortal mistake that'd torn us into pieces as a dynamite! People believe in other things. People are friends to one another! People love each other. This is the flaw! It's around and inside us! I can't betray him! I know very well what is waiting for me, but I won't betray him! Run! No!
