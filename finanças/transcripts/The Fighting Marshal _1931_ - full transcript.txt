Hello, boys.How are you? Well, there's Benton's pardon. It will sure be a big surprise to him. It sure will. I'm glad to see the boy get a break. I always liked Tim. He's been a model prisoner and has never given us a bit of trouble. Oh, Matthew?Yes, sir. Will you bring Benton here? Benton doesn't know he's pardoned, does he? No. A man named Stevens was shot. He thought he was going to die and he confessed that he and another fellow named Ainsley had given false testimony at Benton's trial three years ago, and caused him to be sent up for life. The dirty rat. They ought to be strung up, sending a man up for life. Yes, but Ainsley and Stevens got away from the authorities and disappeared. However, I guess Benton will be very glad to know he's a free man again. He sure will.I should say so. Guard! Tim Benton and Red Larkin have escaped. Warn the guard! Yes, sir. Red Larkin made the break with him. Sound the alarm and get after them. [ALARM BLARING] [ALARM CONTINUES BLARING] [BELL CLANGING] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] Warden, the boys made a clean getaway last night and we haven't been able to find a trace of them anywhere. Too bad Benton had to do that, but I know it's Red Larkin's fault. He's a bad one. A desperate killer of the worst kind. He was serving a life sentence himself. I'm sorry he got out. He'll be a bad influence on Benton. Too bad.Yes, it is. Patterson, I want you and Conroy to use every possible means to locate them. Try and find Benton before Larkin gets him into trouble that will bring him back in here again. All right, Warden. We'll do our best. John, take a letter to the governor. [TYPEWRITER CLACKING] My dear Governor,[TYPEWRITER CLACKING] Tim Benton, number 4862, and Red Larkin, number 674, made their escape last night. WARDEN: One of these men is a desperate character.[TYPEWRITER DINGS] The other one... Tim Benton,[TYPEWRITER CLACKING] as you know, was a pardoned man. However, I'm positive he is not responsible for the break. Hoping we will have something to report shortly, I am yours, respectfully, Harry Decker, Warden. [PANTING] Reckon that old prison's a long way behind us now. Yeah, but I can't hand this country much. There's one thing, we've gotta get rid of these rags. They're a dead giveaway. And I'm speaking up for the first clothes we see and I don't care how I get them. Now lay off that six-shooter. That's going to get us into trouble. We got trouble enough on our hands. Aw, shut up and lay off of me! All I'm worrying about is something to eat. Well, unless my eyes deceive me, Mr. Larkin, there's a ranch house in the distance. Well, if it isn't the first time your eyes have been right in two weeks. Let's mosey. Well, looks as though the folks are away. We might as well make ourselves at home. All I'm worrying about is something to eat. I'm so hungry I could eat up the knobs off the door. Well, there's the kitchen. Use your own judgment. Boy, ain't this great. Somebody was sure kind to leave us all this grub. Look, eggs, bacon, coffee, Red, there's everything here. We're gonna have a regular banquet. Mmm, boy. What's the matter?I thought I heard something. You heard that? I've got kind of an uneasy feeling, as though there was somebody around here. Aw, you give me a pain in the neck. Gee, you give a guy the jumps. Just the same, I'm gonna have another look around. I'd feel better. Come on. Stick 'em up! Just another one of your dumb hunches. There's nobody in this house. I told you I had first call on any clothes we found. Well, don't get excited. I'll toss you for 'em. Toss nothing. They're mine. What gives you first call on them?This. That's the difference between you and me. You're a big-generous hearted cuss, aren't you? All right, keep 'em. But remember that six-shooter is gonna get you in trouble one of these days. Yeah? Well, buddy that's my funeral. And if you wisecrack with me very much it'll be yours. Hey, why don't we eat? All right, that's not a bad idea. I don't know why we don't. Come on. ♪ Oh, de cook she's name was Rosie ♪ And she come from Montreal ♪ She's been chambermaid on lumber-barge ♪ Way down here last fall ♪ Oh, she rain all day the night we come ♪ We got all ringing wet ♪ If it hadn't for the sun came out ♪ She would be raining yet [HUMMING] [HUMMING][PAN SIZZLING] Mmm-hmm! [CONTINUES HUMMING] [SNIFFING] Mmm! Hey. Didn't I tell you I want those eggs straight up? I'm sorry, Mr. Larkin, they were straight up. They took one look at you and turned right over. However, if there's something else you would like, you can fix it yourself, you red-headed mug. Fix it? You're always wanting me to fix something. Didn't I fix it so you got outta jail? Yeah, you did. And a couple of other fellows by the name of Ainsley and Stevens fixed it so I got in. But now that I'm out, I'm gonna clear myself of that murder charge. Hey, are you still trying to stuff it down my throat that you were framed? Why don't you give me the lowdown? Come clean. I'll tell you. Three years ago, my dad and a fellow by the name of John Sebastian had a big cow outfit up North. Sebastian killed my dad. That's the same story you've been telling me for the last two weeks. Well, nevertheless it's true. Then he hired a couple of fellows by the name of Ainsley and Stevens to swear that I killed my own father. Of course, the circumstances were such that I couldn't prove anything different, I went to the penitentiary for life. Yeah, go on. Sebastian took over all his property. Later on he sold the ranch, he took the whole thing over through a lot of forged deeds he had. He got rid of the ranch and other properties... But he kept the mine that he and dad had outside Silver City.[EXHALING] Silver City? That mine made him rich. I see his name in the papers every once in a while now. What he's doing, where he is, he's a big social lion. He's back east taking it easy somewhere now. Hey, buddy. If you're on the level, you had a rough deal. I spent three years in that penitentiary and I've got quite a score to settle with John Sebastian and his two henchmen. How you gonna do it? I'm gonna find Ainsley and Stevens and make them clear me. Of course it's gonna take money. But that's where Sebastian's mine comes in. He's going to finance the game. RED: Just how? There's a payroll goes to that mine every month of $20,000 and I'm going to lift it. [LAUGHING] You're gonna make the old man pay for his own hanging. He stole that mine from my father. It rightfully belongs to me, doesn't it? Hey. And if you stick up the payroll you'll be stealing from yourself? TIM: Certainly. Boy, ain't that great! [LAUGHING] DINSMORE: Don't move! Drop that gun. Put your hands up. Face the wall. Sorry to have interrupted your meal boys. Pull up a chair. Sit down. It's all right. Dinsmore's the name, gents. Marshall. Headed for Silver City, just been appointed. [SIGHING] Prisons... Walls... Box cars... Days without food, clothes, freedom... And a Marshall drops out of the sky. Boy, ain't that great. So I always give you the jumps, eh? You know they killed the last marshall in Silver City. I was on my way to take the job, saw you two fellows heading in here, so I laid for you. Sorry to spoil your plan for a holdup, but I guess it's back to the jug for you boys. Ain't that great. Well, now don't take it too serious. Here, smoke up, then we'll be on our way.Oh! Oh, big-hearted Red.Oh. [LAUGHING] Thanks.You're welcome. Hey, Marshall. You know, I had you figured for a dirty old polecat. You ain't such a bad fellow after all. How far is it to Silver City? Well, I have an idea it's about 50 miles. Never been there?Nope. Stranger on this part of the country. I'm from upstate. Oh, I... I see. You got a match? Sure. Good work, Red. Now, wait. You've knocked him cold. Oh, let me finish him.Oh, now just a minute. You're always trying to use that six-shooter. It's gonna get you in trouble one of these days. Yeah? Well, it'll be me getting in trouble, not you. Oh, use your noodle, will you? Now, look at here, that fellow must have a horse around here somewhere. I'll put on his clothes, get myself cleaned up, get on that horse, ride into Silver City and get a line on things. Say, that's not a bad idea. Well, now you're getting some sense. You stand guard over him till I get back here. Now come on, let's get his clothes off.Okay. Hey, boys, pipe the dude with the deep wide hat. Must be our new marshall. He's three days overdue now. MAN: If he knows what's good for him he'd be two years overdue. Hey, Pop, here comes your new marshall. Well, dog dinged if I don't believe it is! Welcome to Silver City, Marshall. We've been expecting you. Glad to have you with us. Come on over and meet the boys. Boys, step up and shake hands with your new marshall, Bob Dinsmore. Marshall, I'm mighty glad to know you. They killed the last six marshalls we had here.[GASPS] Well, you boys kind of take me by surprise. I didn't expect such a hearty welcome. Anyway, I'm glad to know you all. Yes, and I'm mighty glad to know you, Bob Dinsmore. Thank you. Well, boys, it's happened. The new marshall's just arrived. Let's give him a rousing welcome to Silver city. Ready, boys? One, two, three.[GUNSHOTS] [ALL LAUGHING] [GUNSHOTS] [ALL LAUGHING] That hat cost $25. I want just $5 apiece from you boys. Now dig. That's only four. I said five. That's better. Now, gentlemen, I think we understand each other. I'd like to meet him. Well, we sure need a man here like you, Marshall. Well, just in time. Hello, Ed. Meet Bob Dinsmore, our new marshall. This is Ed Myers, your chief deputy. Oh, howdy do? Glad to know you, Marshall. And a doggone good deputy he is, too. What's going on, Alice? Why the new marshall just gave wild Bill and his gang a shooting lesson. Daddy, don't you think you ought to meet him? I should say so. I've got some business with him. Well, looks like we're having a sort of a family reunion. Hello, Clint.How are you? Meet Bob Dinsmore, our new marshall. Mr. Wheeler, superintendent of the Sebastian mine. How do you do, sir?It's a pleasure indeed. He's splendid, isn't he? Oh, you think so? I certainly do. I want you to meet a particular person if you don't mind. Surely. Seems to me you're taking an awful lot of interest in a stranger. Alice, may I present our new marshall, Mr. Dinsmore. My daughter. How do you do?How do you do? I hope you'll like us here. Oh, I'm sure I will. Won't you have dinner with us tonight? Well, it's very kind of you but I'd better spend the rest of the evening getting acquainted with my new duties. All right. But you must have lunch with us tomorrow. Well, thanks, I'd be glad to. So you see my name is Bob Dinsmore. I'm the new marshall of Silver City. RED: Gee, ain't that great? But that doesn't answer my question. What are you doing here? Now listen, if you promise not to get sore I'll tell you. You see, uh, it was like this. When you leaves me with Dinsmore the first, he was doing a Rip Van Winkle, you know... Sleeping peacefully. So... I continues with my eating when suddenly I feels a gun on my back. I says to myself, says I, "Ain't this great?" But being a quick thinker, I suddenly whirls around and knocks the six-shooter out of his hand. But he jumps upon me and we go into a terrific struggle. And then... We both struggle for the gun. We get to it about the same time. The gun goes off and Dinsmore drops. You don't have to tell me any more. You killed Dinsmore, didn't you? But it was an accident, I swear it upon my honor. Red. That gun's gonna get you into trouble. Yeah? Well, if it gets me into trouble, it'll get me out, see? Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were busy. Oh, that's all right. You didn't interrupt us. As a matter of fact he was just going. Well, I'll be seeing you around, Marshall. I forgot to tell you yesterday how to get to our home so I thought that... That I'd stop by and go with you. [CHUCKLING] Well, that's very kind of you. Well, as a matter of fact I was just about to start out to try and find your house.Oh, were you? You know, that's the best pie I ever tasted in my life. Aunt Emily baked it. She's a wonderful cook. Oh, she certainly is. You know, Marshall, with you here I feel much safer about that payroll. Well, you know you can count on me to do everything I can to protect it. Alice, why don't you and the marshall take a walk? Oh, I'd love to. Would you, Bob? Oh, would I? Thanks, Aunt Emily. You get some awfully good ideas.[LAUGHING] He's a nice boy. I like him, you know. He sure is. Higher. Oh! Oh, you're going to be over the tree tops in a minute. There you go. [GIGGLING] Now watch yourself. Here you go. Swing high and swing low. Swing! [GIGGLING] Wouldn't you be in an awful fix if that rope broke now? Oh, you'd catch me, wouldn't you? I'd try. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] JOE: Hey, Marshall.Yeah. Miss Alice left this note for you. Well, thanks, Joe.That's all right, sir. Say, I wanna see you. What about? We're not here chasing petticoats, savvy? What do you mean? You know what I mean. That Wheeler dame. Aren't you butting into something that doesn't concern you? Take a tip from me, buddy. They're all alike. They'll get you into trouble. A dame sent me over the road once. Girls are not all alike, Red. Oh, they're all the same. Hey, I've been trying for a week to get a chance to talk with you. How about that payroll? Payroll? Oh, yeah, the payroll. Yeah, the payroll. How about it? Now here's a little btip for you. We gotta be moving in a hurry. What's the big rush? Well, your old pals Ainsley and Stevens are in town. In this town?Yep. [ALL CLAMORING] Hey, Marshall, you're needed over here right away. What's going on over here? Ainsley! I ought to kill you. Where's Stevens? Just like you, Stevens. [ALL CLAMORING] Ainsley. You're going to tell the truth this time, if I have to kill you. And I'm collecting from you, too. You sent me to hell for three years and now you're gonna pay for it. [MEN CHEERING] Good work, Marshall. Here's your gun. Thanks. Now give me that pocketbook. Hurry. Here.Thank you, Marshall. Now will you appear against these men if I throw them in jail? You bet I will.That's great. Now, get going. Hurry up. Come on, you. Marshall? Yes?Here's your hat. Thanks, honey. Here's your hats, you mugs. Now get out of here. I'll take care of them. Come on, move out. Hurry up. Come on, boys and girls. Everybody up to the bar. The drinks are on me. [ALL SHOUTING EXCITEDLY] What's the idea? And what you think you're gonna do with us? I'm gonna put you right where I've been for three years. Behind the bars. You can't do that to us.Oh, can't I? Well, I'm doing it. Now get going. Smart fellow, ain't you? Figuring we're gonna square things up for you. Well, how you gonna make us do it? You're gonna clear me or you're going up for ten years for stealing that miner's pocketbook. Yeah, and what'll happen to you? One word from us and you'll go back to that penitentiary for life. You'll never get the chance. But you can't open your mouth. They're looking for us, too.Shh! On my way home, Marshall. Thought I'd drop in to see if you wanted anything. Why, yes. I had word that that Kirby gang's been making trouble over on the other side of the divide again. We should go over there and kind of get them straightened out. That's a mighty big job, Marshall. Take a few weeks to do that. Yeah, that's what I figured. Better take a pack-horse with you. All right, Marshall. So long. Good luck. Hey.Hmm? I see you got Ainsley and Stevens. Yeah. I caught myself a couple of hornets. What are you figuring on doing with 'em? I'm gonna keep 'em in jail until they decide to go before a court and testify to clear me. Hey, suppose he tells that deputy you're an escaped convict? How you gonna handle him? I got rid of that deputy for a couple of weeks. And I'm gonna settle with those birds inside. Gee, won't that be great. [HUMMING] Gee, that's pretty. But sing the words for me, won't you? All right. ♪ When your lips meet mine ♪ In a kiss divine ♪ I awake ♪ And find I'm dreaming ♪ Like a sweet refrain ♪ You'll return again ♪ But it's not the same ♪ I'm dreaming ♪ You can never be ♪ In reality ♪ And when you're with me ♪ I'm dreaming. ♪ Though you must be real ♪ Something makes me feel ♪ I'll awake ♪ And find ♪ I'm dreaming I shouldn't have done that. It was all right. No, it wasn't. You... You don't understand. Bob. Bob, don't you care for me? More than anything in the world. But I haven't the right to. Is it another girl?[SCOFFS] It's more serious than that. And something I can't tell you about so... So please don't ask me. Oh, but, Bob, this thing you speak of can't be so serious that it'd make any difference in our love? It's so serious that I'm saying goodbye. Goodbye?Yes. I'm going away. Oh, but you can't. I won't let you go. Please. Hey, you. You told me to meet you in half an hour. You're an hour late. What's the matter? I just came to tell you, Red, that it's all off. What?The payroll job. So, you're throwing me over for a dame, eh? Don't be a fool. With all that dough you could pay off Ainsley and Stevens and square yourself with the law. I thought so, once. But when you get outside those gray walls things look a little different to you, Red. That's the wrong way to go about it. Oh, yeah? That leaves me out, eh? Yes. I think we better call it quits. Oh, you double-crossing rat.Go easy, Red. I could kill you like I'd kill a snake. I wouldn't try that, Red. All right. You win this hand. But don't forget, buddy, there'll be another deal. JOE: Aren't you going to wait for the Marshall? MAN: We're late now, Joe. We can't wait any longer. We'll have to go without him. MAN: You'll have a hard time explaining yourself... AINSLEY: Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't do it that way, Red. Now, listen. Will you quit yapping? I told you I'd get you outta jail if you'd help with the payroll. I know. But why steal Sebastian's money when we can make him give it to us? Let us go get it.Wait a minute now. Wait. That Tim Benton's liable to cause us trouble. Hey, I killed that Marshall and Benton is wearing his clothes. He'll have a hard time explaining himself out of that one. He sure will. But don't worry about Benton. We'll get Wheeler on the way to the mines. Come on let's go. What's the matter? What happened? Oh, I don't know. Somebody sneaked up and hit me from behind. All I can remember. Here sit on the chair and get yourself together. I'll get you a drink of water. Take that. It'll make you feel better.All right. Feeling better now, Arty?Lot better, thanks. That payroll of the mine is coming through today. I've got a funny hunch that those fellows are going to try to lift it. Now you saddle up my horse as quick as you can. I'm gonna meet Clint Wheeler, protect that payroll and we'll get Ainsley and Stevens at the same time. Now, hurry.All right. MYERS: Where you heading for? I'm going to meet Clint Wheeler and come through with that payroll. No, you ain't. You're staying right here, Tim Benton. I guess you kinda made a mistake, haven't you? Bob Dinsmore is my name. No. Tim Benton. A circular came through the mail from Montana Penitentiary. It said look out for you and Red Larkin. I see. I wired the warden, he's sending two men down. Ought to be here pretty soon. Clint Wheeler's coming through with that payroll to that mine today, and I've got a hunch it's gonna be lifted. Now, I'm going to meet Clint Wheeler and come through and protect that payroll. Don't worry. Wheeler will wait until I get there. I guess I better lock you up. You know where it is. Come on, move. You're right. I am Tim Benton. But convict or no convict, I'm gonna save that payroll. There they come, boys. Let 'em pass, we'll get 'em from the back. That looks like a hold up. Get out of here. Hiya, hiya! [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [STAMMERING] Never mind. Hurry up and open that door. What happened? You stay here, pop. [GUNSHOTS] Come on, let's go. [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] Get rid of the old man. We got to get out of this open country. Hustle up. We'll head for Lone Wolf Canyon. Let's get going. Come on. AINSLEY: We'll be riding right with you.All right. Looks like they got you, all right. Better take him back to town. Old man Wheeler's been hit pretty hard, Al. Better take him into town and have Doc Nolan look him over. MAN: All right, Sheriff. Come on, boys. They'll be after us fast. We better hide the chest and come after it later. Right, we'll hide it in that hollow tree over there. That's all right, boys, that'll do. Now, listen, fellows. We'll mount fast and scatter in different directions and we'll come back here after sundown. We? You must have a mouse in your pocket. You ain't coming back. Well, we gotta come back to split the dough, ain't we? Yeah, but just two ways. [GUNSHOT] It's our dough now. Let's get moving. Oh, no, you don't. Keep your hands up, you fellows. Now I've got you right where I want you. Now you fellows perjured yourselves and sent me to the penitentiary. And now I've got you for murder. You can't take us in.Oh, can't I? No. We'll tell 'em your right name. I'm going to take you back and you're gonna make a confession clearing me of my father's murder or I'm gonna fill you full of lead right here.That would be murder. Well, I just as soon go back to the penitentiary for two murders as for one I didn't commit. Now what are you gonna do? Are you going to clear me? Or am I going to give it to you? Well, we'll go back. All right, but pick up Red and get him on that buckboard. All right. Now pick up that strong box and put it aboard that buckboard. Now climb up on that seat and drive for town. And remember I'm right behind you. Guess we lost the trail, boys. Better turn back. Well, Bob, I see you got all three of them. I sure did, Pop. You and Art give me a hand, pack Red inside. And you fellows, get ahold of the strong box and bring it in here. Now you fellows stand over against the wall. Arty, keep an eye on them. Good work, Marshall. Bob, I'm so glad you're safe. Well, how's your father? Well, the doctor said he'll be all right. Oh, that's fine.Hello, Benton. Hello, Bill. You're not going to take me in this time, though. Those fellows over there are gonna clear me. They've already cleared you once. We've come down here for Red Larkin and try to stop you from getting into another mess. Gee. And he's been telling me the truth all the time. I ought to arrest you, Benton, for impersonating an officer. Well, we won't hold that against him. Didn't he bring in those crooks with the payroll? Besides, he's the best Marshall we ever had. And I hope he stays here for our new Marshall. Where's the real Dinsmore? Why, I killed that man. Was that the serious trouble that was going to come between us? That was it. Come over here, I'll tell you all about it. Boys. You ain't gonna take me back this time. Ain't that great?
