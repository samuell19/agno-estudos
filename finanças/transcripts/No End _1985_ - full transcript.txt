NO END This call is monitored. The time is 7:12am. I died... ...four days ago. I got the car out, as usual. I waited in it for Ulla and Jacek. The engine was running. The radio forecast was rain. I felt a stab of fear. "My heart," I thought. But the pain never came. All I felt was fear. I took a deep breath. And that was that. I wondered if the melons on the balcony would ever sprout. Ulla walked out of the house with Jacek. She came towards the car but I slipped away. She couldn't open the car door. But I could see her somewhat from up above. That seemed strange. After all, I was still sitting at the steering wheel. I felt good. Everything was so peaceful... ...and quiet. Although Ulla seemed to be screaming. I didn't feel dizzy as after my first cigarette. I couldn't feel the weight of the keys in my pocket. It struck me I could come back to myself if I wanted to and drive Jacek to school. But I felt better as I was, much better. I watched the coffin being closed. It was then that Jacek understood, because he began to cry. His hands were frozen. But he was ashamed to put them in his pockets. I went back home. It was still empty. Darek's file was lying on the desk. I wished I could be with him in court. I only saw Ulla and Jacek after they got back. They fell asleep together on his bed. He snuggled up to her for a long time. She woke up in the night and moved to her own bed. Ulla? Tomek here. - I'm in Warsaw, just landed. - Where? At the airport. I'm hoping to catch your lawyer husband. - He's gone. - At 7:30? Have you two split up? ls that the alarm? How's that for timing? Antek is dead. The funeral was yesterday. Call me back later. - Don't talk about it at school. - I won't. I'll come straight home. You'll be here, won't you? I want to be with you. Mummy? The phone is ringing. - Hello? - ls that Mrs Zyro? Yes. I have to see you, about my husband. Hello? I said I need to see you. - Who are you? - I'm Darek's wife. Your husband was his lawyer. You must know that It's a political case. I need to see you. Call the office. I'm not a lawyer. I'm sending them all the files. That's exactly It How about biology? Do we have to draw... We have a crossed line. Hello? You must have Darek's file. Hello? - Mummy, bye. - Bye, Jacek. Are you waiting for me? I called this morning. Wake up, Sylvia. - We drank some of your milk. - It's all right, come in. How can I help you? - As I said, I need that file. - What file? The file. My husband's case. I can't give it to you. Why won't you help me? It belongs to the new lawyer. Those are the rules. Don't you know? Files sometimes disappear and nobody knows how. You couldn't care less. Sylvia, let's go. Wait. You said it was a political case? That's right. I'm not allowed to do this, but if the file is here I'll let you see it. Is she thirsty? Bored? No, she likes listening to grown-ups' talk. - There's nothing in it. - What are you looking for? I wish I knew. There's nothing here. - What did he do? - A strike. He organised a strike. Who will take the case now? Maybe someone like your husband? I can't think of anyone like him. Wait... There's this old lawyer Antek trained under. - Old? - Yes. He was at the funeral. His name is Labrador. Perhaps... Here's the lawyers' directory. He must be in it. You'll find that out in section 4. I'd rather know who the judge is. Goodbye, and thank you. Sorry to keep you. How can I help you? Mrs Zyro told me you freed lots of people. That you could help me. Those were different cases. My last political case was in 1952. He got the death penalty. I've never done it again since. Now I only do petty crime. The wife won't be testifying. - Why not? - She left the country. Tell our client to remain silent. Take a taxi. I'll pay you back. Smuggling cases, that's my speciality. No more politics. Not anymore. Have you heard of this case? It's delicate and difficult, like all of them. You're forcing an old man to make a hard choice. Not me, the present times. I'm quite aware of that. But what can you do about it? Have you got the time? It's a quarter past one. Damn it, my watch! It's stopped working. Do you know how I got it? It was a present from Antek, when he finished his apprenticeship. Let me sleep on this. Call me tomorrow. Good morning, Counsel. - Have you heard? - Heard what? They've done it. After 70 years, they're showing me the door. Has it gone through? It will, I'm sure of it. We're finished. What can one do? Guess what? They're taking away our robes. Come January and we're out! So I've heard. But this charade... how about that for my grand finale? - A kind of swan song. - Excuse me? People sometimes change their minds. You don't have to call. I'll take the case. Are you free tomorrow at four? Who are you calling, Mummy? No one. I wanted 10 call someone, but I forgot who. - Looking for something? - No. I'm going through these things, tidying them up. A man called earlier. He had a funny name. Gibraltar... Labrador. That's it. He asked about some file. I know. I'll turn your light off when I go to bed. - Jacek? Good night. - Good night, Mummy. Antek. He was in the car, waiting. I'd been on the phone. Maybe if I hadn't been late... - The heart is the heart. - But it can't be a coincidence. - What could you have done? - I could have been there with him. Don't think about it. What can I think about? You're still young. You've got a nice kid. You're a good translator. Ulla... things weren't great between you, right? In a way they weren't. But then again, they were. Does that make sense? But he's gone. Tomek, your friendship with him goes back ten years. Even further. Yes, but I was talking about when we met. Did you know about certain photographs of me? Naked? He told me. - Did you see them? - Of course not. - How did he find out? - A "friend" sent them. I found them yesterday. He cut out my face. He knew how much I earned as a guide. I could have explained. Why didn't he say anything? Why did he cut out my face? Have there been similar cases? Yes, quite a few lately. - What's that? - A note. That's what his wife must have been looking for. "Dear Mr Zyro, I'm very glad you're defending me. "You're young and you understand. The first in a month. "You're right about having to return to society, "but I also want to keep my dignity. I will do as you say. "No politics. But I'll admit to being a strike leader. "They trusted me though I hadn't been in Solidarity. "I wanted to settle grievances, not to wreck the machinery. “I'm worried about my family. "Tell Joanna not to take Sylvia to her father's. "My cell mates and I send you our best regards. Darek. “I'm glad you don't want me to act insane." Who will take this case? Shit! I've been away too long. Otherwise I'd do it myself. But I can't. - I suggested Labrador. - He'll never take it. He already has. - What's this mark? - Which one? The question mark. Was that you? By Labrador's name. Did you poke around in Daddy's things? - No. When? - Yesterday. You scribbled on his papers with a red felt-tip pen. - No. - You're lying. You're lying. You know I'm not lying. I'm going to Praga. Want you come with me? No. Give me the keys. I'll stay at home. Could you wait a minute? It's OK, it's Antek's wife. Blackbeard. - What did they take? - Guess! - Banned books. - Yes. Many? Yes. I was actually reading Brandys. - How about the notebook? - They took it. Any tapes? They took everything: the typewriter, the letters... They were all from Maciek. His notes? Just an English notebook. - Didn't you ask for an affidavit? - No. I got scared. Show me your letter. Slide over. "I hereby request the return "of the property confiscated in the search..." "Search"? Use "visit". They hate the word "search". And "request"? What are you requesting? Right? - But that's polite. - Does it have to be polite? Give me some paper. I'll do it. - What's happened? - My car broke down. Remember this? I showed it to you. The list of lawyers. - It wasn't torn then. - What else? - That mark wasn't there. - Of course it wasn't. - Did your son do it? - No. I know he didn't do it. Then who? Antek... Antek did. He doesn't want Labrador on the case. So what now? No, we're being foolish. I must go. Taxis aren't easy to find. I'll come with you. I'll drive you, sir. I have a car. Don't be so formal. Can you drop me off at the institute? I'll get ready. What institute? For cancer research. For his radiotherapy. Were you hoping to find something in the file? I didn't know you. I was afraid. There was a message. It said you shouldn't take Sylvia to your father's. I don't get it. I do. What shall I tell Darek? I'm due back soon. Say what you know. But remember, tell him everything is fine at home. We have no problems. OK. Blackbeard! Take this. Thanks. - Drop by sometime. - I will. “I'm worried about my family. "Tell Joanna not to take Sylvia..." You'll ruin your eyesight. Zyro got along very well with our client, didn't he? You can go home. Shall I make you some tea? At this time of the day, tea... Sorry. Speaking. Today? What time? Shit! I'll be there. Run along. Don't forget to close the door. - Do you know what you want? - Yes, I do. You want better conditions. You want more justice? Yes. But where? - In Poland. - Which one? Which Poland? You don't want to talk to me? Am I being too blunt with you? No. Well then, which Poland? - Ours. There is no other. - Exactly. Socialist Poland? Can you see yourself not being a socialist? - Not really. - There you are, then. The only Poland you want to make better is a Socialist Poland. And that's what you should say. Never mind what you really think. You will go on trial. Have you ever been in a courtroom? Judges are what they are. They respect their job. They may be tired, but they're well aware history is like a wheel. Let's give them a chance. - Do you know what that means? - Yes. Deny everything. Son, there's always some leeway between selling out and compromising. - There's nothing. - There is. Just look for it. There's little evidence against you. They're only interested in the leaders. If you confirm it, you'll be saying the strike was your idea. - It was everyone's idea. - Sure, but it won't look that way. Even if you all wanted the strike. They all wanted it, but I was the one who had the list. A sheet! A sheet. Without evidence, no committee, no leaders. - Is that how it happened? - Yes. Not quite, but near enough. I told you, there's always some leeway. Now, have you ever been to a demonstration? Yes. Once. Why only once? I'll tell you why. The opposition were wearing the same uniform you wore in the army. You wanted to take part, but couldn't. Psychiatrists call that... Mr Zyro was against pleading insanity. Ah, Antek... He was a wonderful man. But I'm 40 years older, and I can't do it his way. I may be old and not as talented as he was. When he was my pupil, he was already better than I. He was, you might say... an artist. He operated in a different manner and succeeded, despite everything. I simply take the scalpel and make a cut. You got along well with him, didn't you? Very well. Evidence was beneath him. So were politics. He'd appeal to people's consciences, even their emotions. But I can't take that risk. I've only one duty. To get you out of here. Is there anything you need? We're thinking of a hunger strike. What for? Try to think about who will benefit by that. Do you have a better idea? No. In that field, I have no good ideas. Forgive me, but it's warmer in the kitchen. I had a cake but I ate it. No coffee either. Tea? No, thank you. What's this? Those are the notes Antek made. Can you decipher them? Just a few words. "The law demands... "The law demands too much of people today. "It kills what is... "It kills what is most precious in human relationships." The next bit is underlined. "If the law is against loyalty and trust, then it is immoral. "No government should be... "...should be interested in ruling over a divided nation." Is it a question or an exclamation mark? I never could read his writing. He wouldn't want me to take this case. He wanted to see that boy out. Yes. Do you miss him? Very much. I miss him very much. MERRY CHRISTMAS What is he saying? "“It's coming. It's going to erupt..." - Want some? - No, thanks. We're listening. I took the package yesterday. - What a horrible place. - Poor grandmother. She didn't want me to go inside, then she cried. Did they give that girl her things back? Justyna! - Did you get your things back? - Not yet. She took in one of ours. Hence the search. But they missed him. Antek also took someone in once, who was out after curfew. He hid him from me. Antek was afraid afterwards. - Of what? - I don't know. Someone's asking for you. He won't come in. Do you know each other? - Marta Duraj. - Urszula Zyro. Are you related to the lawyer? - Antoni? - Antek. I'm his wife. I met him years ago. How is he? He died... ...a month ago. - Cigarette? - Thanks. Did you know him? Fifteen years ago, during the summer. He was still a student. He stayed at my place one night. A girl and I were sharing a cabin by the beach. We were already asleep. While he was swimming, his tent was stolen. He was still dripping. He sat on the bed, soaking wet. And then there he was, very thin, with his bow legs. He didn't have bow legs. - He did at the time. - Then what? He wanted to be a judge. He was into Camus. The judge-penitent... I read it later. Was he a judge? No, a lawyer. It was his childhood dream. Any more memories of him? - I don't think so. - Nothing at all? He left soon after, to do his apprenticeship. I never saw him again. Were you married long? Eleven years. Quite a long time. Was it a heart attack? Yes. How did you know? He mentioned his heart at the time. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. They started a hunger strike. Labrador said Antek was his own man. Was he? We'd all like to be. But Antek really was. No one told him what to do. He wrote that it was becoming unbearable. But his letters were censored. What's that? A picture. I just found it. Do you remember this? I sure do. The summer of '67. How skinny he was! Who are the girls? I can't remember... He fancied this one. - Brunette? Named Marta? - No, blonde and thin. Rather like you. We always fell in love with the same girls. Including you. In fact, I still am. Ulla, I'd like you to know... What are you looking at? His hands are like Antek's. Look. You're not listening to me. I said that... Don't say it. - Please. - Forget I said it, then. Holy shit! That's my car! Hurry to the car pound. Do you have any money? Yes. Will you wait for me? No, I'll get a bus. Go on. My husband died 36 days ago. One day he was there, then... he was gone. I thought I loved him a little, not a lot. Family, work... I had everything. But I didn't realise . Those days when I hated him, did they really exist? It's only now I realise how happy I was. I can't accept it. I can't. I keep seeing him. I can't forget him. I thought your hands were just like his. You wouldn't understand anything. It's my problem. Sit down a moment. Goodbye. I brought a pair of trainers. For Sylvia. They were at home. Who was that? My father. My dad. - Where's your daughter? - With a neighbour. I can't take it anymore. I have Darek on one side and my father on the other. He brings me newspapers, with articles exposing them. Who they are, Darek, Jan... I can't take this anymore. I'm fed up with this shit! I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Ulla. Of what? You know... Some leave the country. Others die. But Darek... ...will end up in prison. - And I'll be on my own. - Who has died? Blackbeard. Two days ago. I translated Orwell. He wanted to read it. You don't care about any of this, do you? You see all these tragedies, but only yours matters. Yes. You're right. Yesterday I did something bad. Very bad. I was unfaithful to Antek. But he's not here anymore. I don't know why I did that to him, when I can still feel his touch. Listen, I have this address, at Jelonki. What is it? It's this young fellow. He helped Marta. You met her here. She was suffering, and it did her good. - Do you want to try? - Try what? To forget. That's bad news. I want him to get out, not to starve. You'd better tell him to start eating. He must set a good example by eating his soup at dinner. I'll arrange a visit. I agree to go, but I won't say anything. Why not? He'd kill me. Do you want him out? I won't tell him anything. I'm his wife, can't you see? I understand. Does he think he'll gain anyone's sympathy? Certainly not the sympathy of those that matter. They won't move a finger to help. We know that. His stubbornness will only make matters worse. Very well. I'll speak to him myself. And you can go on playing the silent wife. Someone told me to show you this. Who did? They formed a new union at the factory. - Do you know these people? - One of them. A friend of Darek's. They grew up together. Can you spare me a moment? A client of mine's been hit with a tax claim. He bought a car abroad. Who used the word "bought"? Was it your client? He received a cash donation. That's tax-free. Excuse me. I'm only an apprentice, but I know how you feel. If I can help you in any way... In terms of money, are you OK? I forgot that's why I came. I've brought your money. Don't even think about that. I only wanted to know if you were getting by. If you aren't, we can help you. No, thank you. Things are better now than before. Could you leave me the newspaper? Of course. Goodbye. Good morning, Judge. We'll soon be meeting professionally. - That's right. How do you know that? - Someone told me. But before that, I'll have something to tell you. One little thing. Always at your service. If you're interested, I'm hearing a fascinating case. Here's what you'll do. Go to the factory and ask that fellow if the new union would be prepared to show they care about workers, even strikers, by standing bail for Darek. - Do you have a name? - Of course. Damn it! Where's that newspaper? It was here a minute ago. It can't have vanished. - Go buy another one. - Newspapers now cost five zlotys. - Even the Party paper? - All of them. Lie down, lie down. I haven't tried anything yet. But it can work. - Is this man alive? - Yes. - But he can't be with you? - Right. - And he never will? - Never. Good. Now, I'm going to put you to sleep and try to erase him from your memory. Please, lie down. Flat on your back, relaxed... ...eyes open. Now look at me, and let your whole body go limp. Legs, arms, stomach, face... Every muscle relaxed. Now lower your eyelids, gently close your eyes. You feel light, your muscles are relaxed, your eyelids refuse to open. Now raise your arm. It's light... It takes no effort. You're asleep. Now lower your am. Gently. You can't feel your arms, your legs, or any part of your body. Your mind is blank. You're no longer thinking of him. Alive or dead, he's gone, no longer there. You won't want to be with him, see him or talk to him. You don't want to be with him. When you wake, you will have forgotten his voice, his face. You won't want to think about him. Now ['ll wake you up. You're beginning to feel your body. To feel heavy. You're waking. When I count to zero, you'll wake. Five... four... three... ...tlwo... one... zero. You've woken. We may have to repeat this. Please, come again. Do you feel all right? A glass of water? Please. Did it help? Yes. Mummy! What happened, Jacek? Were you dreaming? Did you have a nightmare? Come on, tell me. - Don't you want to tell me? - I do. Well? You and Daddy. That's nice. I never told you this. - What? - I woke up one night. The light was on in your bedroom. Daddy was on top of you. You were both naked. That's what I dreamt now. What were you doing? Making love. We loved each other. You were born because Daddy used to hold me tight. Now you love me. You're cuddling me. Mr Labrador. - Are you alone? - am. - And that coffee? - It's for you. I thought you might be trying to reach me. What would you say if I brought you a guarantee, like bail for Darek, issued by the honourable new union? Would you release him? - If the legal union agrees. - They will. What about him? He'll be the hardest part, right? I'll talk to him, if you give me some hope? I won't be the only one hearing the case. Do you think you can bring them back together? Not at all. Just a good old lawyer's trick. - Know my answer? - Yes. Screw it. Exactly. I'll be seeing you. Go get yourself another coffee. The judge drank yours. You know I joined you to wait things out? I know. I'm neither deaf nor blind. Criminal cases, divorces... that was fine. But the way you're handling this... Listen, if you're not happy, you don't have to stay. You'll get the good references you want. Your wife sent you this newspaper. The Party one? She sent this? Read it. That's how things stand. Do you know any of these people? Yes. A childhood friend. - He joined the strike. - Precisely. I'm going to pay him a visit. What for? To have him vouch for your good behaviour. I will not behave. Take what they're willing to give you. Seize your opportunity. He's your friend, isn't he? He was. Fine, but if he vouches for you, you'll be out of here. And it'll save you the special court. You won't get sent to prison, or you'll get a suspended sentence. Now you'd better be discreet if you want to stay in the game. I've never had to beg a defendant to agree to be released. Don't start now. - Not eating? - No. Do you think that will change anything? I do. Damn it! I can't watch you Kill yourself. I can't allow... Then don't. Shout it from the rooftops. I won't allow it! Go ahead, die! Jump out of the window. I can't. The bars. Precisely. You've all chosen to live. - Who has? - You have... all of you. The working class. Despite martial law, you all wanted to live. Didn't you attack the tanks? Shouldn't we have done that? That's not what I said. But you have to be logical. Someone who's chosen to live... ...must be able to endure a lot. "Point 5: to be aware of the consequences..." Antek's dead. He's no longer around to make Darek leave prison with dignity. And Darek refuses my approach. There's a third possibility. Let's be honest and let him decide. It was a mistake to take this case. No, it wasn't. I had to take . That boy deserves it. I told him he had to survive... ...without wasting his energy. His kind of integrity is important, it can prove useful to others. People need an example they can follow. - After all, who are we? - Defence lawyers. Yeah, you can say that again. Murderers, thieves... they all want to get out. But we have an innocent man who doesn't. I have 45 years' experience, but I can't understand this case. Who are we defending? And against whom? Against what? - You and I have the same first name. - I think about that all the time. At least we have to let him know his family is doing very well. That they have enough money to live... ...and that he shouldn't worry. Who will tell him that? What do you mean? You will, Kid. All right. But I'll also tell him what I think about all this. Do you like that? It's cool. Do you know it? Yes. Look what I found. - What's that? - A canister. It's tear gas. Where did you get that? Where did you go? Constitution Square. Stay away from places like that. Promise? Smell it. It still stinks. You're all I've got left. Promise me. Please! Mr Labrador is willing, but tired. You dislike the way he wants to defend you. And that's all right. These are hard times, and it's important to cry out. Never mind the bars. People will hear you. Plead guilty. Say, "Yes, I organised the strike. "I want to fight. “I'm sorry it took me so long to realise that." The strike was a pretext for something bigger. The men supported you because they wanted to fight too, but didn't dare. You showed them the way, and you don't regret it. It will look just like an ordinary trial. We'll invite observers, who won't be allowed in the courtroom. Everyone will think it's an important case. The rumour will spread all over Warsaw like wildfire. Here's what counsel will say. "I shall not appeal to your sympathy for the defendant. "He's a modest man, but he's not the only one. "The defendant is a courageous man. "And courage is contagious. "He is dangerous because he speaks the truth. "And that is something that no bars can hold. "That is the reason why this court's work is futile. "The defendant knows that futility and impotence breed rage." - What you speak of is hatred. - Yes, it's wearing you down. Mr Zyro spoke of clarity... ...as necessary to see things better. What is important is to find the right track. Each person has to find it. Alone. Even if everybody else... All alone. That's poetry. Labrador says there's no evidence against me. That I'd have to give them a fake smile and get out of here as fast as possible. That's mere pragmatism. It's a compromise, actually. I'm proposing another way out. Tell them your aim was to subvert the system. No, it wasn't that. - I don't think so. - What then? Whether you realise it or not, you were trying to subvert the system. At least you'll go to jail for something. You're facing a minimum sentence of three years. And maximum? You got it. You have to go straight to the point. Otherwise, we'll continue to queue for a bar of soap. Still not eating? No. Hold on a few more days. The worse you look the better. What's the matter? Say it, damn it! You lose your temper too often. I'm sorry. The hunger strike has ended. - When? - Yesterday. You won, Labrador. Yes. I have. We are the defence. Here's the guarantee. We must use it wisely. That's right. What day is it today? The 3rd. Take that to the judge. Tell him I'll be there in an hour. Move it, damn it! I came to say goodbye. Why? I'm leaving. It's not easy telling you, or anyone for that matter. - Where are you going? - Home, via Canada. Isn't that too easy? It is. But why should I choose the hardest way? There's nothing for me here. The world of the memories and the photos no longer exists. Smiling faces, a helping hand... Things used to be simple. Now that's all gone. - Was that part of Antek's world? - Yes. Yes... People have shut themselves off. You can't tell the good from the bad. Some people disgust me... ...others reject me. I tried to make it on my own, but I felt too lonely. Then I thought... I'm leaving. Antek's still here. Forget him. - I saw him. - In your dreams. No, I saw him. I could have asked him... - Where are you going now? - Into town. Can you drop me off somewhere? Come in. We've started. I don't want to eat, I don't like fatty food. I want to be thin and well-proportioned. Eating doesn't give you pleasure. Your bodies cannot feel hunger. You're asleep. Asleep, asleep... - Well? Has he gone? - He's gone. - Do you want to lose weight? - No! I want to repeat the treatment. But he's gone. I want to anyway. You lied to me. He's dead, isn't he? Yes. You see... ...I don't communicate with the beyond. Daddy used to bring me here to see Grandfather's grave. May I go? - Just for a moment? - Go ahead. I love you. Can you hear me? I love you. I love you. Mummy, I've something to say you won't like. What is it? - I prefer Daddy's mum o yours. - I suspected that. You hardly ever brought me here. Well, now you're here. Look, there's your grandmother. Grandma! He's very fond of you. He told me in the car. He's a good boy now. Very good. Off you go. And don't worry about him. Are you going far? No. Mummy. - You didn't say goodbye. - I'll just say, "See you." You'll be away a long time, we should say goodbye. Goodbye, Mummy. Goodbye, Jacek. In the name of the Polish People's Republic, the Warsaw Metropolitan Court, on 6th November 1982 after hearing the evidence against Dariusz Stach, finds the defendant guilty of the charges against him, and by virtue of Article 46 of the martial law decree, and Article 12 of the Special Regulations Law. Waiving summary procedure, this court sentences the defendant to 18 months' imprisonment. The execution of the sentence is suspended for two years. Therefore, the court suspends the imprisonment of Dariusz Stach. You are free to go. Congratulations, sir. Thank you. Mr Labrador? Yes? You shouldn't. We're going home We're going home. Here I am on the other side. My last day, my last case. Can I read you something I found”? Of course. "And I don't even know how it came about “that into mangy dog from wolf I changed. "Perhaps it was the wind that stung my face. "Or looking at the sky, my jaundiced eye squinted. "Or it was the reflection of fear, not fire, “that danced in my spine. "Or perhaps it was the collar "no one ever placed on me, as no one ever came for me, "leaving me to scurry like a servile dog. "Lord, You who cherish even the slithering creatures "and know how to instil pride in a worm's pale blood, "help me open this throat of mine, which in silence begs. "Assure me I am free even though I cry." Hi.
