You just finished basic. I'd like for you to have more non-combat experience first, but, uh, a military-wide shortage of chaplains says otherwise. Infantry battalion, he said. Surge unit.

Now, here at Forward Operating Base Falcon, we are 8.1 miles south of the Green Zone, but a nine iron away from a freeway we are not allowed to control, and neighborhoods full of people we're both here to protect and those who will try and kill us. It's your job to know the difference. Head on a swivel. Watch your six. (sighs): At ease. Major North, Chaplain Darren Turner. Good to meet you, Chaplain. Welcome to camp. Nice to meet you, too, Chaplain. Sit, sit. Master of Divinity, huh? How's that working out with your kids? Sir? Your kids, Chaplain. 'Cause North here, he's got grand accreditation, too, but he'll be the first to tell you that, uh, in the real world, much less this one, theory and master's dissertation just goes right out the window, kind of like at home with three kids. Well... they're ten months to eight years, so... so far they're on board. Well, it's always a bonus having a chaplain who's a family man. Divorces filed in the last three months. And, hey, mine didn't last either, so I'm not judging. But I do know that soldiers losing families and having nothing to go home to is not the stabilizing force we need around here. Which goes for you and yours, too. Oh, uh, understood, sir, but... Heather and I are called to this. I mean, she even volunteered for the family support team. It's what it's about for us. Well, all right, then. (Jacobsen clears throat) - Welcome to Falcon, Chaplain. - Thank you, sir. TONYA: So... the Casualty Response Team is a part of Family Readiness Group, and, um... (exhales) I... I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm listening to myself, and... they can call it the Family Readiness Group, but... this is our third time out, and nobody's ever really ready for this job. I imagine it's a hard job, but I really do feel called to it. Um... Maybe I shouldn't ask you this, but... Every time Michael comes home... he's more... angry. Distant. Do you think you can ask Darren to look out for Michael? I don't know, maybe talk to him? - Of course. - NORTH: Gun range is down that road. Hospital's on the right. Chow's on the left, and the chaplain's tent's right down there. - Can I speak with you, Chaplain? - Certainly. Darren, why don't you go to the range and meet your assistant, Sergeant Peterson? I'll take your gear for you. Cease fire! - Excuse me, Captain. - Huh? Know where I can find a Sergeant Peterson up here? You found her, sir. SHONDA: No offense taken, but if there's a guy here who can keep you alive and run your office like I can, I'll eat my helmet. CAPTAIN: Ready! Aim! Fire! If you get any better, you're gonna embarrass the snipers around here, Sergeant. Six years Atlanta PD. Here by way of National Guard. Here by the way of Fort Stewart and six years of college campus ministry... so it was pretty much the same thing. - (jets whistling overhead) - (both chuckle) ♪♪ ♪♪ SAM (over phone): Don't forget, Daddy, send us - goofy-face photos, okay? - Aye, aye, Cap. - Mommy wants her turn now. - Thank you. - Phone hog!

Chaplain Turner, mind sending them out? It's been an honor meeting such amazing men and women, committed to our country and defending the defenseless here in Iraq. I hope it goes without saying that my tent is open 24/7. I'd like to meet you all. (Darren clears throat) Lord... be with these men and women as they go out today. Please protect them. So... did I sound okay out there today? Sorry, I used to be on staff at a church, and... now that I'm here I don't want to sound like I'm at a pulpit. Otherwise, you know, nobody'll come by. Just leave that box of snacks on your desk. Word'll travel. They'll come. Oh, I saw a glimpse of your delivery today. Ma told me to bring it. Apparently went through my nightstand to make sure. Ah, one of those moms that loves their daughters... - I hate those. - Ah, more like one that thinks getting me back on track is her job, not mine. (bullets striking Humvee) You on that, Gonzalez? Take that as a yes. SHONDA: I have a son. Wow, look at that handsome guy. You, uh, talk to him yet, since...? He's three, so not much of a talker. So, does he take after you or his father? Huh! You mean the guy that saw the double lines on the pregnancy test, left and never looked back? That guy? No, he does not get that title. And no, he wasn't my husband, so save the lecture. My mama got that covered. Well, he's a gift from God. That's all that matters now. It was long but fine. I mean, long. Your prayer. Sounded like you cared. (insects chirping) Hey, Chaplain, you almost finished? (sighs) So, talked to my family the other day. Yeah? Sounds like yours and mine have been hanging out. Great. Well, it sounds like Tonya would love to hear from you. What's your deal, man? - What do you mean? - I mean, messing with other people's lives just part of your job description or something? I mean, kind of. Okay, well, my marriage... is none of your business. You don't know anything about me or my family. I know your family loves you. (Michael sighs) And I know they'd love to hear it back. You know what? I'm-I'm-I'm gonna tell you how it works. 'Cause you never been to Iraq before, so you don't know what it's like to come home. You... ain't never gonna be the same. And neither is your little picture-perfect marriage that you probably think you have. Stay out of my business. Tell you what.

Hey, it's, uh... It's me. - Michael? - Yeah. No, it was... It was a different number. It's a...

Amanda, I don't know about you, but this is by far the hardest thing I've ever done. It is okay to feel overwhelmed. You're not the only one who feels this way, I promise. You-you know, um, my number is on the Readiness Group contact sheet if you ever want to talk or hang or, you know, whatever. (crying): I'm pregnant. I don't know how I'm supposed to tell him. Oh.

The troops were part of the deployment that left Fort Stewart in April as part of the troop surge. - (knocking) - (gasps) (sighs) - I am... so sorry. - Oh, God. It's okay. I wasn't thinking. I should have called. No, it's okay. It's okay. I'm just so relieved that you are not a chaplain in uniform right now. Oh. Okay. So we're up?

You ready to do this? (inhales) Oh, Lord, we have to do this well. We've got this. You okay, Chaplain? - Yes, sir. - Good. 'Cause there are some folks around here that could probably use a visit right about now. (doorbell rings) JACOBSEN: Turner? Sorry, sir. Standing here now, I'm... not quite sure what I should say. Well, I'm-I'm no expert in your line of work, but... how about you just leave that Master's of Divinity back in your tent, and... just go give a few boys your heart? As it stands now, it'd probably go a long way. (door closes) Third platoon, Alpha? You found it, Chaplain. Come on in. Well, I'm sorry to interrupt you guys. This is my first memorial here, so I could use your help if you don't mind telling me about your friends. Civvies were all around us as we came off the last bridge. Two blasts, one right after another behind us, and we ran back, you know, pulled, pulled Mitchell out of the fire, but he was already gone. And Cosgrove was already inside, getting the two girls out. The flames just took him. GONZALEZ: Mitchell was engaged. Cosgrove's wife is pregnant. I've been with them both since basic. And when my fiancée decided that military life wasn't for her, those two guys didn't leave my side till we shipped out. Probably kept me from losing it. What'd you do with the girl, Chaplain? Medics finally took her. So, uh... What, do you have a Bible verse to explain why a girl's life was taken before it even began? (sighs) No. No, I do not. Okay. (sniffles) But I have daughters, too. And the thought of losing them is beyond what I can imagine. Yeah, I have a daughter, too. So what? You're peddling a God that'll take mine tomorrow, maybe yours the next day. - Look, you're angry. - (scoffs) I get it. I mean, we all rage at death, right? I think there's a reason for that. I think... it's because we were made for life. And I believe in a God who came to rescue us from death and bring us into life. Who gave us all life to begin with. For a specific time and a specific purpose. Until He chooses to bring us home with Him. (crying, sniffling) You want to know what that little girl said when we first picked her up? She told me through the translator. She just wanted to live to do two things... fly in an airplane and climb a mountain... ...to be closer to God. Little innocent girl didn't do anything to deserve to die. She wanted to be closer to God. And she believed in a God that didn't do anything to save her life. You got a Bible verse for that? I wish I did. Yeah. I hear you. I do. (sighs) Sorry about your friends. And I'm sorry about your fiancée. Thanks, Chap. Okay. (clears throat) (sighs) Uh... hi, babe. Man, I hope there's never a reason for you to watch this video. (explosion in distance) But if you are, I suppose there's no use in covering that up.

Home safe in heaven. All right, see, that's the part that got me. All right, so let's say I buy in and something happens to me, and I'm safe in heaven. Where does that leave my wife and kids? I mean, if there's no guarantee of safety here, what happens to them? Do my kids go off the rails without a father? Does Amanda lose it, let some drunk loser move in, start hurting them, making their lives a living hell while I'm all cozy and warm in heaven? Tell me my kids won't ever go through what I did. (sighs) When my dad left, I knew he wasn't coming back. I mean, he said he stopped loving my mom, but it felt clear as day that he stopped loving me, too. Okay, is that it? That's not helping. I didn't have a dad... but I had... I still have another Father. One who has never left me. One who has never abandoned me. One who won't abandon you orAmanda orAlexis or that new little one you got coming. No matter what comes next. All right. Don't get any ideas. I just like free stuff. HEATHER: Mm, the kids made me a cake for our anniversary, at least, so that was nice. Kids remembered, and I didn't. Don't worry, I saved a piece to put in your next care package. Um, this is a wild idea, but would you be up to coordinating some Christmas stockings for the soldiers? You could fill them with gifts and snacks like you've been sending me. Yeah. Yeah, sure. How-how many do you need? Uh, give or take, a thousand. O-kay. So, reinforcements then? (chuckles) Yeah. Um... I guess I could get some other wives involved. I could actually, like, turn it into a community thing. Get some churches and schools in on it. That's a great idea. Man, can you believe school starts in a week? No, I can't. How are they?

Far more than me, you men and women know what it is to offer up your lives for the good of others. And one of the many challenges here and at home is that unless you've done it, actually lived it, it's hard to appreciate what it takes to make that sacrifice. Well, you know who else actually lived it? Who willingly sacrificed His life so that others could live? Jesus. He came, He laid it down, and He rose again for me and for you so that you and I can live. And if that act doesn't give you hope and confidence in a God that loves you and is willing to do anything for you, I don't know what will. And that's what this day, Easter, is all about. Hope. For all of us. Now, if I've learned anything about you guys, it's that you know how to go all in. And there is no better day than Easter to go all in for Jesus.

Uh, so I work at the Digger O'Dell Nursery, and I'm in charge of the trees and plants and flowers. Like... chrysanthemums. Until a few months ago, I was a chaplain for the U.S. Army. A, uh, true soldier feels so deeply that good people deserve to be safe and free, that he is willing to risk losing the most valuable of things just to go and help them. And every soldier who serves in a war comes back with a medal. It's just that sometimes you can't see it, 'cause it's on the inside. I don't feel like a hero, 'cause to me... the true heroes are the soldiers' families who also have medals on the inside pinned to their hearts. Like I know my family does. (applause) (crickets chirping) Heather, please... know that I love you, and I have since the first day we met. (laughing): When I ruined those flowers you were taking pictures of. Chrysanthemums, right? Who the heck names flowers, anyway? I miss you more than you can imagine. And love you just the same. (sighs) Oh, God. I am hurting. (sniffles) But so is the man that I love. Please forgive me for judging what I don't understand and for leaning on him when I should be leaning on You.

I wanted to do something special for you. So I enjoyed some light reading and viewing materials the other night. Babe, I thought I knew, but I had no idea. What you lived through. What you had to carry. What you're still carrying right now. I'm so sorry. You have nothing to be sorry for. And I get it now. You know, you did want to talk to me. (Darren sighs) It was that moment before we got married, you know? You were standing in the rain as I changed your tire. What about it? One of my favorite memories. (laughing): What? I had just broken up with you for a second time. Yeah. But you called me. So I knew it wasn't over. I missed you. (birds singing) Military's missing a good man. Chaplain Rodgers, sir. - It's good to see you, Darren. - You, too. I hear things have really turned around for you guys. Yeah, and I plan to keep it that way. Home is the best place to be. Hmm. I got a call from a good friend at Fort Campbell. Their Special Forces team needs a chaplain. Now, Special Forces deployments are limited and brief. You'd even get the promotion to Captain that Jacobsen wanted for you. I'm honored, sir. I truly am. But I'm sorry. Like I said... military's missing a good man. Hey, guys. I think I hear some action brewing at Fort Bumblefoot. Meet you there in 2.5 seconds! - Wow. - Last one there's a rotten egg! (Darren sighs) You know, I think we should probably bring the fort with us when we move. When you take the job. What are you talking about? I heard it through the grapevine, so I called Chaplain Rodgers myself. Who are you, and what have you done with my wife? Look, we know what to expect now. We know how to prepare. Look, you and I both know this is what we're called to... Captain. (Darren chuckles softly) It's who we're called to. Right? Hmm? RODGERS: To all who shall see these presents, greeting. This is to certify that the president of the United States of America, authorized by executive order, has awarded the Bronze Star medal to Captain Darren A. Turner, United States Army. (applause) (cheering) You may be seated. Thank you very much. This is, uh... deeply humbling. It is with great honor that I have served my country. But I only stand before you today because Jesus is my rock. And because I have a family who loves and believes in me, and friends that never gave up on me. And it's also why I can and will continue to serve as I've been asked, to the very best of my ability. My family and I... we made a promise to each other to protect ourselves from anything that might try to divide us. And we've found that the best way to do that is to put on the Armor of God. So today I encourage you to wear, by faith, the belt of God's truth. The breastplate of His righteousness. Sandals of His peace. The shield of faith in His power against all enemies. The helmet of salvation, found in Him. And the sword of His powerful and gracious spirit. Before I left for Iraq, I thought I knew what it meant to put on that armor. Here's what I learned. No one is promised tomorrow. So I'm choosing to put my faith in the one who holds all my tomorrows. As for me and my family... it's the only way to live. (whooping) (laughter) - Hey, buddy. You must be Colby. - Hi. - Shonda, hi. - Hi. Yes. - So nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you. Pleasure. What's this? Bars look good on you, sir. Yeah. Look taller, right? Yeah, a little bit. Little bit. I had my eye on you, Captain. It's why I'm here, why... we're here.
