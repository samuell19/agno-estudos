Shut up! THE BEAST MUST DIE Michel! I'm going to kill a man I don't know who or where he is, or what he's like But I shall find him and kill him Been ill? Yes, in a way Nothing serious, I hope No, not in the way you mean, anyway I know that clinic; they'd do wonders for a corpse My brother-in-law... my sister's, really, but I live with them... ...he's a nurse there; a red-headed fellow, Andre Duplessis, remember him? That Dr. Duverger is a top-notcher; and the food's great, too It's pricey, of course; but, still, you've been lucky The bastards! I was thinking about the sign A kid got run over three weeks ago So the sign goes up afterwards? You know civil servants It was drizzling a little, just the usual Have you hurt your foot? You've had the curtains cleaned; good Where's my boat? A mast came off; I sent it for repair You were quite right You've stuck that on again; good Listen carefully, Madame Levenées I've something very important to ask you Never speak of it again; don't even refer to it Promise? And if for any reason you should have to mention him some time... ...then talk of him in the present, as though... I know it's silly, but I prefer it that way Now, to change the subject: have you followed my instructions? - Is his room empty? - The furniture's gone to my niece And the toys? No, I couldn't... It may take six months, a year, two years, but I'll find him I shall win his confidence, then I'll bide my time Finally, smiling, I shall look him straight in the eyes... ...and for interminable hours I'll make him await death I've work to do; if anyone telephones, I'm not to be disturbed I said I had work to do; don't bother me! Yes, but it's the police Just a moment The investigation is proceeding With no results, naturally We've made appeals for people to come forward The front of the car must have been damaged by the collision Our inquiries at garages and petrol stations... ...about repairs to wings, radiators or bumpers have yielded nothing As one might expect It's like searching for a needle in a haystack A haystack? If I wanted to hide a needle... ...l'd put it in a box of needles The best way to disguise damage is to create more damage To avoid the consequences of an accident, I'd stage another I'd drive into a wall or a tree, obliterating the first collision What you should be looking for... ...is an accident in that area the same day We have; the idea isn't exactly new All right, but just let me think aloud for a minute First possibility: the car wasn't damaged, which isn't likely Or maybe he put it in a private garage and it's still there Or, more plausible this, he carried out the repairs himself Admitting this hypothesis, does it tell us anything about the murderer? If he did the repairs, he must know something about it... ...or at least have the tools to beat out a dented wing He would have to do the repairs by night... ...and the hammering would have wakened the neighbours But a wing can be taken off and replaced I'm coming to that; if he replaced a wing or a light... ...he's an experienced mechanic and must work in a garage Or else he himself is the owner of a garage... ...who can get replacements from his own stock without anybody knowing Rather wild reasoning... My son was crossing the street from left to right He was thrown to the left So the left wing must be damaged Find a left front wing I need a little job done on my car, so I... - Where's the car? - At home Couldn't you bring it along so I can see what needs doing? I can do it myself if you can let me have a new front wing I see; what kind of car is it? A 404 I've no wings for them; no wings at all, in fact How about old stock, or even something slightly damaged? I don't keep such stuff; it all goes to the breaker's yard What the hell would I do with it? I've no wings at all I'm sorry, I'd have liked to oblige I think I've found what I want Mind my tools Can't you find something better? It's all bashed up Less than mine; I'll fix that Didn't you say a left wing? That's a right wing The result is rather disappointing Five exhausting weeks for nothing... or almost nothing False trails, vain hopes that leave me bruised and despairing I quite realize that the terrain is limitless That I am one man on earth seeking another My only weapon is patience; I can wait I have all my life, and all his Unless chance takes a hand; chance is weird, and it does exist In fact, chance is all there is Like everything else, my pen on this paper is a coincidence I bet you got stuck in the mud You're not the first that happened to Every time it rains, someone gets stuck there Sometimes several cars I think the engine's flooded; would you know? The last time it happened it wasn't just anybody She was a film star, a really fine-looking woman She was in a sports car... a Mustang, so my son says A fine-looking woman The man with her was going on about the front of his car It was the third of January, as I remember Yes, that's right. A nice little piece, she was Not stuck-up, either. A bit upset; she was crying Don't carry on like that, I said, there's no real harm done What was her name? That I don't remember, but I did see her on television I saw her on television in a programme called... I've forgotten that, too But my son's interested in these stars... much too interested Why do you want to know? Well, you know... when someone famous has had the same experience... When are you going home? Why don't we go now? You could do with a drink Afterwards, I'll get my contraption and pull you out Where's Jean-Frangois? Tell him to come Careful, it's not very clean Come in and make yourself at home 3rd January; that would be some coincidence It never occurred to me that it might be a woman But I'd have no qualms at all about that I can see her I can see her deliberately driving full-tilt into the quagmire... ...TO WASH MY SON'S BLOOD AWAY What are you up to? Get out! Tell this gentleman her name Héléne Lanson You've never heard of Héléne Lanson? I don't go to films much and I never watch television You must have seen her; I'll show you a photograph Get us a drink, mother There aren't all that many pretty women on television What was the programme called? Les Cathares You're right, she is beautiful The man was an ugly customer, though But what a car! What was the man's name? I've no idea; he was an ill-tempered brute, though He kept bawling her out for crying I don't know how to put it, but there was a callous look about him Yes, that's it: a callous look Her husband? That's what I think, too! How would you know? She doesn't like the girl and never even saw her What do you see in that bit of skirt? I told you She's just right for the character in my new script So you're going in for movies now? Following the herd! Why not? I can still go on with my writing if I want to What time is she coming? I'm not sure she will come She usually ends up at the St. Hilaire Yes... poor Héléne She could be rather good if they'd let her No one's ever given her a chance? No such luck for her; she's a jinx A jinx; you know what that is Come and dance with me You're late Nice, eh? You look lovely, Héléne I'm not just saying that Anyway, there's a chap here whose eye you've caught I don't believe you Well, sit down He looks rooted to the spot This is Marc, a very talented writer It wasn't difficult She wasn't playing hard to get; but she's not such a fool as I thought She even has a sharp sort of wit So far, she hasn't made one stupid remark It's the best restaurant in Paris, hence in France Don't you find the cuisine amazing? Sometimes she seems to be wondering what I am really up to I've made absolutely no advances; it amuses me to keep her guessing If she knew... She only knows me under my pen-name of Marc Andrieux How could she connect me with the Charles Thénier whose son was killed? I'm biding my time She hasn't been to my place before I'm not sure how I shall act But my resolution will not weaken If she is guilty, she will die I'd rather... How about a drink? Terrible weather, isn't it? We don't get spring any more; no summer, autumn or winter - nothing If I were God... What are you after? What do you mean? You take me out to dinner, to films, to night clubs; why? Because I enjoy it; don't you? What about this script you mentioned? I'm working on it, thinking, making notes Can I see the notes? Well, really, isn't that stupid? It must be my secretary who... who must have put them... Let's be frank; what do you want with me? You aren't a child; it shouldn't be hard to understand Well, pretend I'm a child and tell me All right, if you want me to go through the usual routine I'll tell you... ...that you're beautiful, that you have great charm... ...that I like you And? Since the day you entered my life... ...l haven't been able to sleep or eat... ...hardly even drink The singing of birds is a dreary refrain... ...and the flowers have lost their scent Will that do'? I thought that kind of man was extinct You think no such thing Are you married, or virtuous? Neither Then don't you want to kiss me? What a strange character Tea or coffee? With toast, jam and fried eggs? Yes, I'm hungry It smells good That's nothing Some day I'll do you saddle of hare with sauce poivrade... ...or morel croustades, then you'll really see No teaspoons? They're pretty hideous; I thought you were rich No; anyway, I'm a bachelor living in a furnished apartment Why? Because I travel a lot So I've nothing... Anyway, things bore me Me, too; except living in the country, I'd love that Where are you from? I was born in Brittany And have you... have you still family there? My sister and grandmother How about friends? Not many; my brother-in-law Isn't he family? What's the difference? Where does he live? At Quimper; he runs a garage I'm sorry, I've always been all thumbs What were we saying? Oh, yes, he runs a garage It's the biggest in the area; he's filthy rich What's his name? Perhaps I know him... I'm often in Brittany Paul Decourt I'd be surprised if you knew him No, I don't know him He's a funny chap, you said He's not funny; actually, he's rather repulsive Why are you so interested, anyway? I'm interested in everything that concerns you Well, that's nice The only nice thing since this morning, in fact Do you see him often? - Who? - Your brother-in-law? Not often now; not at all, in fact Since my illness It was nervous depression; everyone laughs, but it isn't funny I agree; I'm not laughing Did you have worries? Yes, but I don't want to talk about them. Got any cigarettes? Yes, they're in the thing in my room You have a Teddy? Give it to me! It's a souvenir that means a lot to me A souvenir of whom? My nephew who died. Give it to me Why can't I touch your nephew's bear? I'm just a tart to you, I know. It's a horrible thing, anyway! You're trying to kill me I'm sorry Me, too I acted like a fool In pursuing a goal like mine emotions must be cast aside The bear my son loved so much... ...is only plush and stuffing, after all I feel oddly tender to that thoughtless little creature Her depression after the crime proves she is more victim than culprit Which does not mean I have changed my plans; far from it In fact... ...l have got what I wanted; emotional duplicity pays dividends I persuaded her We're going to Quimper I pleaded nervous exhaustion and my love for Brittany I used her own argument: was I unworthy to meet the family? She didn’t jib; she was delighted I feel a little ashamed; she thinks my feelings are deeper... I thought he ran a garage He doesn't sleep among the pumps The garage is in town. Hurry, we're late Would your sister think it more proper if I stayed in a hotel? Don't worry, she knows me I'm glad to hear it I mean that after Paris, little sister is not expected to be a nun My sister doesn't care, anyway They have fifteen bedrooms, if you insist on your own I'll show you your rooms You'll have your usual room and Marc the one next door This is yours; I hope you like it We have friends for dinner; Paul will be home soon I'll just put on a shirt and tie, then join you I've never seen anything so ghastly Come and meet my son, Philippe Stop that now; your father will be home soon My mother-in-law, Madame Decourt Jacques Ferrand, Paul's partner This is his wife, Anna Quimper's a charming town, isn't it? Rather quiet Especially in winter Summer's livelier It's best in spring, though; the fields are covered in flowers That's how it goes with spring The autumn is pleasant here, too The last time I was here in autumn... ...the colours were all reds and yellows and... Bronzes You live in Paris, normally? It's busier than here Rather too busy for my taste, actually My husband and I were there three weeks ago; the traffic's impossible Especially in the rush hours Two hours to cross Paris. It's ridiculous Not to mention the noise I read a report saying it reached some terrible decibel level And the pollution of the atmosphere; it's a real national problem An international one, even How will it all end? I see that lots of young people are very worried about it You had a fine summer Don't speak of it! All the tourists going to Spain... disastrous for the hotel business The weather isn't the only culprit; the sun shines here, too No, the authorities must take a good deal of the blame On investments, for instance. I don't know what your line is... I write a little Of course; remind me of your name I read your last novel... what was it called? I liked the end, when the blind old servant runs into the burning house You must be mistaken; I write children's stories How wonderful Another glass? It's fifteen years old I wanted to ask you what you think of the nouveau roman Some people find it boring... ...but I think it's an interesting attempt to renew old forms... ...to reconcile time and space, if you see what I mean Yes, I'd say so, yes I mean, Nathalie Sarraute, Butor, Robbe-Grillet... ...even Gegauff, like it or not, are pretty extreme Yes, indeed, very extreme Here's Paul Think you're a lady of leisure now? Just because we had a bit of fun? You'd better think again, girl And wipe that grin off... ...or it won't be my hand on your rump, it'll be my boot You're here already? Sorry I'm late; I had meetings What gloomy faces This is simply disgusting It's drowning in gravy; why didn't you boil it down? I did; four hours Give it five or six hours, then When the meat is cooked, you keep it hot... ...and do the liquor in a casserole Haven't I told you a dozen times? Are you a gourmet? On occasion, yes So you understand, right? They say I grouse, but I don't like waste Know what my butcher's bills are? A hundred a month! Cookery's the one art that doesn't lie You can be taken in by music or painting, but grub's good or bad My dear wife, though... ...prefers sitting in her room writing her little doodads I'll treat the gentleman to one O moon of hope, valley of tears My heart shrouded in black Please, Paul, stop Elixir of eternal youth, great design of spring for all thing Dancing in my heart on the purple... ...in my heart on the purple asphodels While in the dark depths of Erebus, ultimate revolt... ...shakes the foundations of my ego Madame shuts herself away in her room to shake her foundations! What's your professional opinion? For that I think you must be forgiven for neglecting your stove You're very kind, but Paul's just teasing I'm fond of you, anyway, sweetie I've nothing against poetry; in fact, I'm pro culture Idiot boy! Look what you've made me do! An abominable creature; a caricature of the wholly bad man... ...such as one never imagines meeting in reality I was afraid I might like him Now my joy in killing him will be doubled Are you still anxious to see over my garage? Yes, I'd love to What are you writing, a book? I wouldn't have minded being a writer; it's easy money I see you don't want me to read it lt's just notes; I don't like showing it to people, because... Why, is it smutty? Not at all, it's just that... It's about a man who's looking for another man - A detective? - In a way I thought you wrote stuff for children Yes, I do; it's about a child You must be afraid someone's going to pinch it No, I'm sorry... it's just that... I could lend you the key of my safe Important things should be hidden... like my deeds If you like... ...l'll dig a hole in the garden What a brew It's for the squits; I hope you never need it Big enough? To what do we owe the pleasure, Monsieur Andrieux? He wants to see the garage, I can't think why Maybe he wants a setting for his next story A mucky place like this? You're kidding I know him; very ingratiating, sticking his nose into everything LET THE MEN DO THEIR JOBS, DELAYS WILL INCREASE YOUR BILL How women do carry on She wanted to be a painter, so I got her a tutor A week later she'd forgotten that, took up mysticism instead Saturday horoscope stuff... Zen, Hinduism, Buddhism... ...Bramah, Rama, Siva and I don't know what Now it's poetry she's on I wouldn't care, except that the kid's becoming the same Maybe she's just trying to escape What from? I give her everything No, it's the family; her sister's just the same That Héléne, she gave us a hell of a time; me especially The little bitch. I could tell you a thing or two But I didn't come to share secrets What do you want with that junk'? Nothing Do you know a sculptor called César? His passion is scrap metal; everything has a soul, he says Does he really? Aren't you a bit touched, too? Some soul! Why do car salesmen always kick the tires? Why do film-makers do this? They're tricks of the trade If you want a car, this is a snip - Thanks, I have one - Not like this I'm not giving you a salesman's line This one belonged to me; a great car I have to get rid of it Why do you have to? Do I ask if your granny rides a bike? What are you up to? Don't hurry, we've got all day I've been looking everywhere for you, to sign my report How about History? Unfortunately, I swotted the wrong thing Well, we won't quarrel about trifles After all, we're brothers-in-law; you're almost family now Almost, but not quite The bastard! The filthy swine! I wish he'd die - He's your father, old chap - I don't care Why don't you kill him? Why don't you kill him? That's crazy talk; do you realize what you're saying? I knew what you'd think If you don't do it, I will - What will you do? - I'll do it I've one twice as large What a family tableau, like a Victorian novel How wonderful, a spider-crab! Take them off, I said - I'm cold - I'll warm you - What about Jeanne? - She doesn't care - And Anna's husband? - He doesn't care, either I love you Why are you looking at me like that? You, too, slept with him? Who? You know who I mean It's the most horrible memory of my life Forgive me? I've nothing to forgive Have you other secrets? Isn't that enough? Are you sure you haven't? Have mercy, Marc I've confessed enough for one day You see, Jeanne, commonly called a shellfish... ...this is really a highly ferocious marine gastropod The tide's coming in, fisher-folk; time to go They say it's hard making money in the provinces, but it isn't I can put you onto something I'm no businessman Don't be stupid Nothing to it; invest ten thousand and you earn two That's twenty per cent. An old woman owns some land near here Just right for a golf course. She won't sell, but she can be ruined I could get it for nothing She left some bonds with me, but there's no proof, no receipt even I'm quite serious. Want to go and have a look? It's not far Get a move on, you lazy lot! I can't hold on I'm going to be killed! Help! You can't just leave me here; help me! Stop getting in my hair! Let's go I'm fed up with your fishing parties Put the light on Why did you help him? Who? You should have let him fall Stop it He doesn't deserve to live I know I don't like him, either Lovers often hesitate, not from timidity... ...but to prolong the anticipation Filled with hatred, I linger over what awaits me Killing him will be no more than throwing away the peel... ...of a fruit one has relished He cannot swim; his son told me so I spend hours walking with Philippe I must coax Decourt out in a boat I shall hire a boat, a small one I shall wait for a south-westerly, the prevailing wind We shall have the wind behind us to the headland After that we shall be tacking into the wind My moment will have come I shall wait for a squall and put the helm hard up... ...which will bring us to inevitably, the boat... ...will capsize They don't hire boats, they make them to order But the boss is a mate of mine; he'll oblige I don't mind buying one For one trip? You're not tight with your money He's never here This one isn't bad at all Don't expect me to go with you in that nutshell, will you? - Are you afraid? - No, but I value my life You take ten times the risk every day just crossing the street You like that one, do you? - Saying tu now, are we? - Sure, why not? I hate formalities; I'm pretty direct, but I say what I mean And, frankly, spending money on that is daft No, it's not What do you think? I couldn't care less Most people prefer the Odyssey But the Iliad is the most sublime thing ever written When you get round to Kafka, you'll see the resemblance Homer is much finer, of course There's a city talked about but which is never reached Hundreds and hundreds of heroes fight and die... ...for this unreal, unattainable thing The theme is very simple, but treated with incomparable poetic detail When a bad poet describes death... ...he automatically employs cliches; eyes turning up... ...sweat beading the forehead, the terrible, inhuman grin But not Homer; each death he describes is distinctive and true There is a moment when a young Trojan is pursued by Diomedes He receives the javelin in his neck... ...and the point protrudes from his mouth like a metal tongue And he falls to the ground, biting the cold steel It's a marvelous image You're very kind I was quite lost with these Greeks and Trojans It's a bit embarrassing to say, but I like you a lot I'm embarrassed, too, but glad It's a pity that... - That what? - That you're not my father ls it wrong to judge parents? You know, actually it's rather difficult not to It's best to think of other things, though Ignore them, you mean? In a sense, yes I'd rather have had a father I could think about That's hard, too: not to think I think of him and I hate myself I know how babies are made; half of me comes from him Anyway, your blood is your own Your eyes are your own It's you that sees, thinks, acts; it's you that... All right, go on Tomorrow's Sunday; take me out in your boat I've invited your father He hates boats; he's afraid He was upset that time on the cliff He didn't like everyone thinking he was afraid, did he? Why have you invited him? Because he introduced me to the man I got the boat from His friend made me a special price So it's... it's the least I can do I'll be back in fifteen minutes Hurry, the tide's rising; and bring an oilskin I'll be equipped like a sea-wolf Be careful, Marc; Paul's really no sailor - I'm not a baby - No, but you've a horror of water Except in pastis The forecast isn't good No, but it's just a bit of wind and a little rain Otherwise it's calm and fine Be careful, darling; don't go out too far No, it's not necessary Not necessary? Isn't it a bit choppy? On the contrary, it's a perfect sea - Where are we going? - Round the headland and back But there are rocks and terrible currents there Don't be frightened Stop saying that. I'm not afraid I just don't like mucking about - Want to take the helm? - I don't know how You simply steer like this... ...and control the sail with this rope Scared? - Knock it off, I'm no kid - Come and try, then No point in coming out, otherwise Nothing to it, is there? I must say, it isn't difficult Yes, it's easy I don't see why they go on about it Like I told you What now? Let it go Take over this bloody thing, because... Duck! Let it go! Take over! I've had enough! - Joke over, let's go back - No, the fun's just starting Go back, I said Are you crazy? No tricks, or we'll both die Tricks? Just do as I say; you should have hidden your diary better Do you take me for a fool? You write kids' stuff and think you're so superior All that fuss of yours, so of course I went and read your lousy diary Stop, or you'll make me tip her over There's no point Because my lawyer has your diary If something happens to me, your little black book goes to the police That's why I kept you waiting, laughing up my sleeve You take me for a fool? Why didn't you take it to the police right away? Because you knew... ...you'd spend years in jail? Don't worry, I shan't denounce you On the contrary What I want is your lousy skin, and I'll have it It's as good as done, and you can't lift a finger I'll just take it easy; you're as good as dead Shut your trap! You rotten, lousy bastard! Shut your mouth, do you hear? You stinking, rotten swine! I forbid you to set foot in my house... ...or you'll go out the window! I'll just get my suitcase Your whore can pack it Are you cold? Shall I put up the hood? Don't bother We'll be stopping soon, anyway, for a bite to eat You feel like eating? More than ever What's on your mind? Nothing I don't want to think I'm wondering how you can eat I'm trying not the think, to empty myself, too So far it hasn't affected my appetite; rather the opposite May I serve the duck? The little boy... the one you knocked down on the road... He was my son It took me a long time to find you My real name isn't Marc Andrieux, it's Charles Thénier Of course, in getting you to Brittany... ...my one idea was to meet Paul and kill him ls that why you got to know me? In the beginning, yes You can't imagine what I went through You won't believe me, but... ...l didn't dare say anything I'm a coward I hate myself Someone else said that Let's go back You kill him... and I'll help you The death is reported of a popular personality in Quimper The body of Monsieur Paul Decourt was discovered in his bathroom Death by poisoning had occurred several hours earlier... ...whether an accident or suicide has not yet been established Monsieur Decourt was a well-known businessman... ...whose actress sister-in-law, Héléne Lanson... ...we have often admired on our screens Shortly before the tragedy, she was a guest in the deceased's house... ...accompanied by the noted children's writer Marc Andrieux It is believed they are driving to Paris They are requested to communicate with the police at Quimper Here are the first pictures An inhuman grin... it was terrible to see He did it; he killed him! Please sit down, Madame - I'm Inspector Constant - I'm Charles Thénier You hear that, Inspector? He was using a false name All in good time, Madame, please What happened, exactly? The maid found the body about seven o'clock; soon after you left He had dragged himself to the bathroom... ...and collapsed on the wash-basin, breaking it as he fell How very sad Please sit down We have the results of the autopsy Can I have a drink? You knew he was taking medicine for an intestinal disorder? Yes, soon after I came here... ...he made a point of telling me about it We found some in his stomach, along with poison He'd taken nothing else What sort of poison? It's a substance used for getting rid of pests... ...commonly called rat poison; it's an agonizing death The nerve centers are paralyzed The body is seized by convulsions, as in epilepsy Breathing becomes labored; Decourt must have suffered terribly How very shocking, Inspector Unfortunately for poisoners, rat poison tastes vile Putting it in soup or tea won't do But an evil-tasting medicine would serve It is possible that someone might have done just that Don't listen to the swine, Inspector Unfortunately, the bottle has disappeared; no fingerprints, no clues Any suggestions, Monsieur Thénier? None. Why should I have any? Suppose we talk about your diary We have it and I've read it I hope you appreciated my style Among other things I appreciate your motives We're not monsters But I do represent the law And this diary... ...is damaging evidence against you ls it? How? You say in so many words your sole purpose is to kill him Imagining a crime is no crime You're obviously delighted by his death Being delighted by a crime is no crime, either I admit my sole thought was of killing him I admit that what you've told me fills me with joy My only regret is... ...that he suffered so little My sufferings have lasted since January You're frank, at least But this adds to the circumstantial evidence Maybe, but I didn't kill him Everyone wanted him dead; everyone hated him They did. Except for his mother, perhaps, because she's like him If I were you, I'd take me off your list of suspects After all, I knew he had my diary I knew that if anything happened to him, you'd get the diary I'd hardly be fool enough to kill him, would I? It's true, and I've already thought about that I must question these people, especially Mademoiselle Lanson We'll continue this conversation at the police station Take him to my office I'll join you at the hotel A kind of cow, in two letters lo Having questioned everyone, I've reached certain conclusions It's true, only an idiot would commit a crime... ...in such circumstances And you're very far from an idiot A man in your situation cannot have killed Paul Decourt Unless he's being very clever and playing the idiot Go on Suppose... ...you decided to arouse Decourt's suspicions on purpose You excite his curiosity, let him find the diary... ...get him to take precautions that will seal his doom He'll think his hold over you will prevent you from killing him But he's wrong The opposite happens Yes, but it's only supposition Let me go on If one thinks of your diary as a confession addressed to yourself... ...then you're right It puts you above suspicion But, reversing the proposition... ...suppose it's the motor element in your crime What do you think? Nothing; go on I think your diary was written in order to be found It was found So Paul Decourt could then die Yes, but wouldn't it have been easier... ...if I'd used my pseudonym for everything You know we'd have connected you But you knew you'd be cutting the ground from under our feet... ...by acting openly, didn't you? I'm afraid I must place you under arrest Now tell me... ...where's the bottle? A boy is asking for you. He says he's Philippe Decourt and it's urgent Don't be afraid, Philippe What is it? Something to tell me? The poison's in this I hid it in the cellar, under some rags I killed daddy Do you realize what you're saying? Marc did nothing Daddy was horrible and wicked I got rat poison from the garage and put it in his medicine Daddy put the bottle back in the medicine cupboard Afterwards I took the bottle and I hid it... ...because I was afraid of fingerprints Will you swear to this? Look at me You swear it's true? You know you've ruined your life? Do you? Don't talk about it now Tomorrow I'll tell you everything tomorrow I want to sleep now Héléne darling, forgive me Yesterday Philippe confessed to murdering his father I said nothing; I walked away a free man What a lovely revenge, worthy of a Greek tragedy A man kills a child, his own child kills him Poor Philippe, his hatred almost equaled mine Perhaps this mutual feeling... ...was what drew him to me During our lessons I could have told him how to kill his father I'm sure he'd have jibbed at nothing Perhaps he'd even have loved me more Tell the Inspector that I'm to blame and I alone That Philippe confessed to save me You see, I hated that dreadful man so much... ...that I didn't want to sacrifice my life The Inspector was absolutely right My diary served to make it seem I'd failed But really I'd succeeded Forgive me I can't let Philippe pay for me I thought I'd become as chill as steel... ...but the heart is slow to die Don't let Philippe suffer You must believe me; but for all this, I'd have loved you Now I'm going out to sea... ...far away, never to return I'm going to disappear, Héléne, vanish without trace I was a coward yesterday I was afraid of prison I did not have the courage to reject Philippe's sacrifice So let me choose my punishment One of Brahms' Serious Songs paraphrases Ecclesiastes The beast must die, the man dieth also... ...yea, both must die Farewell.
