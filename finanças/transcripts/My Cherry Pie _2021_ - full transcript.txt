I didn't notice a tow truck here. - Parked out the back. - See? What did I tell you? - Told him what? - Hmm? - Nothing. - No, no, no... What did you tell him? Nothing, just you know, you folks are on the level and all that. He's, he's being stupid. Yeah, we're on the level. I get it, we're not narcs if that's what you're thinking. Not at all. Eddie boy, mate, can I just say this soup's fucking delicious. Freddy! Outside you can say whatever you want! All the heffing and jeffing your heart desires. But not at the dinner table! Please! Sorry about that, love. It's okay. Forgiveness is part of the plan. - Plan? - God's plan. Here we go. You know the big guy upstairs? He has a plan for all of us. I truly believe that. Eighteen years ago, our house burned to the ground. We lost everything. Everyone. We were a big family before the fire. Cherry and I, we're all we've got now. There's her brothers, they have a very nasty temper. They don't have the social skills like us. Bit funny in the head, if you know what I mean. They stay in their room mostly. What? Keep the ones you love close. You never know when you might lose them. You have a word with ways, Eddie. Beautiful shit, man. Beautiful, beautiful. Thank you, Freddy. I appreciate that. - How's your dinner Green? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Beautiful Eddie. Bloody delicious, if I'm being honest. Would you boys like it if Cherry put on a show? - A show? - Yeah. You're our guests... And every guest that comes here and graces us with their presence deserves dinner and a show. What's the show? - Cherry here is a dancer. - What, like a stripper? - I'd pay to see that. - Keep it in your pants, boys. Cherry does ballet, and she's very good. She'll dance for you. Won't you, Cherry? I think we should go to bed. Don't be so rude, Jack. If the girl wants to dance, well fucking let her dance. Yeah, let her dance. Okay, great, yep, okay, perfect. Let's watch the dancing then, shall we? Some bloody ballet. It isn't much, but it'll ah, it'll do for one night. Yeah, ah, I really appreciate it. Thanks again. My pleasure and ah, if you boys need the toilet, right, it's just down the end of the corridor. Okay? If you need anything else, don't be afraid to ask. Yeah, yeah, cheers boss. - Thanks. - Yeah. Rightio... Okay, alright, well, you boys have a good night then, okay? Yeah? Sleep well. - Phwoah, I'm off my fucking nut. - Oh, same. This is some strong shit. Am I the only one that thinks this is a bit fucking weird? - It's just the 'cid man, enjoy the ride. - No, not the acid. This place, these people. There's something off here. That whole dance shit, wasn't that a bit fucking bizarre? I thought that was hot. Woah! Oh man, I had half a mongrel. Farmer chick, that little farmer chick, oh mate! - She's got the eyes for me. - You reckon? Oh, oh, oh, oh, full blown fuck me eyes. We should just go. We hitch a ride to the mechanics, and then we figure it out from there. Mate, you're dreaming. I'm not going nowhere. Oi, reckon I should go talk to her? - Definitely not! - Fucking oath. Is anyone listening to me at all? Oh Jack, mate, you need to stop harshing everyones vibe. - Green.. - Yeah? Go and fuck that little farmer girl. Now that, that mate, is God's plan. You know what? Fine, fine, whatever. Do whatever the fuck you want. Oh mate, do not say that. She's going to get it, huh?! - Wish me luck boys, huh? - Yeah, good luck, brother. Oi, give her one for me, aye? Just one? Just one? What about two, three, four? Five, six, seven? Eight? Nine, ten, eleven! Maybe eleven, just eleven. - Have you got any more durries? - Oh, fuck you! Cherry... Cherry! Oh, my Cherry Pie! Coo-ee! Cherry Pie, where are you baby? - Hey there, Cherry Pie. - Oh, you startled me! - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's okay. Do you need a drink or something? No, no, no, no. I came here especially to talk to you. Oh, okay. - I've seen the way you've been looking at me. - Did you? You betcha. You know what? You've got real beautiful eyes. - Thank you. You ain't too bad yourself. - Oh, you reckon? Should see me nude... Not to brag or nothing but... Like a horse. That's all I'm saying. So, what do you reckon Cherry Pie? You want to go for a ride? - Meet me in my room... - Where? Just down the hall, last door on the left. - Upstairs? - No, downstairs, just through there. Okay, babe. - But don't keep me waiting too long. - I won't. Mummy's boy. Well, mummy's boy... Your mummy, she's about to get nailed. I'll let you watch if you're keen. Ah, holy shit... Chick's a freak! Oh, Lordy. Cherry? What is with the freaky get up? Oh, kinky. Care to join? Did you do all this artwork? You're crazy. I wanted to ask you a question... Have you ever had a boy in this room before? Damn! So I, will be the first. Oh! You can touch me if you want. It's okay... Take it slow. Can I touch you? Come on, baby. Ooh! I like that. The fuck?! You fucking bitch! Man, what is taking him so long? I don't know man, give him all the time he needs. He's just trying to get his fucking dick wet. - I should probably go check on him, right? - Do you want to see his cock or something? Prison was fucked, man. Yeah, of course it was. You don't go there for doing something good. I know that. I mean, you can't begin to understand until you've been there. Yeah, I get it, I've been through some pretty fucked up shit in my life. Mate, you've only ever been visited by horror. I've walked with demons. At night... Oh, it was the screaming... Can't get those screams out of my head, man. It was looking pretty grim for a while there. I was even thinking about doing myself in. - Really? - Yeah. But then I realised... I've got someone watching over me. An angel or something, you know? I didn't think I was going to make it but... Things were pretty grim there for a while but... I got through it. Couldn't have done it on my own. So let me get this straight... You think you survived prison due to some devine spirit? I don't know, man. Something out there but, I can feel it watching me. You really are tripping the fuck out. I'm spilling my fucking heart out here and you're just taking the piss. - Give it a rest. - Give it a rest? Mate, you can go and get yourself fucked. I'm not in the mood for your bullshit, alright? You put me through enough today. Me? Fucking I've put you through shit? I'll fucking take a ciggy as an apology thank you. Jog on, mate. I'm not apologising for shit. You really are a miserable cunt. Freddy, you keep pushing buttons motherfucker, and soon enough one of them is going to be red. - Is that right? - Yeah, yeah, it's fucking right. You talk about how much you hated prison yet, you're doing everything to put yourself fucking back there. Yeah, fucking, me yeah? I come out, fucking, released. And then I've got you cunts... And no one even offers me a fucking ciggy. What are you talking about ciggies for? Bingo... Oh, you have such beautiful eyes, Cherry. Oh, thank you. You're such a gentleman. Oh, look at your rosy cheeks. We stomped out a cunt... And then you stabbed three other cunts. Yeah, Jimmy was a dickhead driver from back in the day that owed you money. I get it. - But Risto, fucking Risto! - Mate, we wouldn't have had to fucking do shit... If you cunts had've come today with some fucking scratch in your pocket. Not fucking penniless! What have you fucking done for three and a half years? Pulling each other's cocks?! Oh yeah... Oh, that's real nice. You made me stand by while you stabbed that cunt to death... And now we're in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere, in some weirdo joint! What the fuck?! Ow, fuck. So who's fucking fault is that? Get a fucking car and maintain your fucking car. - You're the fucking driver, aren't you? - Shut up! Did you hear that? You're just fucking tripping. I know I am, but I still know a blood-curdling scream when I hear one. I didn't hear shit. - Tell me you heard that. - Probably just the cows. Yeah, yeah probably just a cow, screaming for help. That makes sense, doesn't it? Oh, fucking, Eddy's probably chock-a-block in one right now. You know those country boys, they love fucking animals. I should probably go see what's going on, right? Fucking go then, mate. Maybe you and the country boy can tag team minnie moo. - Why were you watching me? - I'm sorry... Do you like to watch? I'm sorry Cherry, I didn't see anything, I promise! - Watch this... - Cherry pl- Oh, fuck this! I'm going to go see what the fuck is going on. Well, fucking go then. Fucking turn off the light when you leave, will you? Whatever, cunt! Well, switch the fucking light off! Hello? Green? Green! Where the fuck are you? Green! Fuck... Walter, you know this is such a shame. I really liked you... Fuck! Fuck you! - Are you looking for your friend? - Please, please, we can talk it through. - What do you want? You want drugs? - I can tell you where he is... - You want cash? - Come on, come on. Fuck you, bitch! Where are you? I can hear you... Fuck! Come any closer and I'll put this through your fucking head. Let me in! - Let me in! - Fuck you! - Let me in! - See, bitch? Let me in! You fucked with the wrong motherfucker this time! I fucking knew it... I knew all of you country folk were fucking mental! Jesus wept... Choke on it! Choke on it, you cunts! It's going to be okay... Well done! Well done! Good job! You made me real proud. Yeah, you did so good. You guys... Yeah, you two! Tomorrow I'm going to make you a special dessert. Twosies... Twosies. Goodnight sweethearts. Goodnight. What the fuck?

Hold on, hold on, hold on. I don't need that right now. Baby, I'm flying, trust me. Oh, you need to trust us Frederick. Yeah, you can trust us. Just relax. Oh, Jesus Christ... Fuck, that shit's got some kick to it. Doctor, the patient's ready for you. Doctor? Is someone else joining us? - Freddy... - Who the fuck's this?! You need to stay calm Freddy. Stay calm, it's just a simple procedure. Freddy, you've got quite a reputation. You're a real wild one. I just want to drill inside and see what we find. Drill inside and see what we find! Drill inside and see what we find! - Drill inside and see what we find! - Drill inside and see what we find! Jack! Green! I need your help! - Are you okay? - Oh, hey... I need some water. Not feeling good. Alright, I'll go get some. - Yeah. - One second. Oh yeah, cheers. You want another? Oh, no. I'm fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah, no, I'll be alright. - Can I get you anything else? - Uhh... This might sound a bit strange, but... Would you mind sitting with me? Sit with you? Yeah, I'm just... I don't know, a little bit... - Just feeling real vulnerable at the moment. - Shh... It's okay... Aye? I'll stay with you. - Alright? Just have a little chat then, aye? - Yeah. - Just, tell me a story? - What, something fiction? Well, tell me about your family. Okay. Like I told you at dinner, there isn't much of my family left. Cherry is all I've got. She has her problems, you know. But don't get me wrong, I love my little Cherry Pie, always have. When sis got pregnant,right, she was over the moon. She did everything right. She cut out the smokes, the wine. Real responsible. She gave birth to twin boys. Something went wrong. It's hard to explain, they just came out a bit funny. So when sis got up the duff a second time, she was determined. At the ultrasound it revealed that she was having twins again. Twin girls this time. When she gave birth three months later... But once again, something went wrong. And Cherry, she came out first. And she was perfect, a beautiful little baby girl. But then a minute later, the other one comes out. Its face is blue. The umbilical cord is wrapped around its neck. They did all they could, they couldn't save it. She was gone. As a family we decided, we would never tell Cherry about her sister. She'd never know that. She was a miracle all on her own. Cherry was 12 years old when the fire hit. I remember walking away from her mum's funeral. And I took her by the hand, looked down at that little girl, and I said that everything will be alright. She looks up at me, this beautiful little baby girl... And she says, "Is mummy gone forever?" What do you say to that? What do you say to a kid? How do you tell her her mum is gone forever? Before I can say anything, she says "Is everyone gone like my sister?" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. So I asked her, I said, "your sister?"... "How do you know about her?" She tells me she remembers being in the womb. She was playing with her sister, and she put the cord around her neck. She couldn't have known about that. Us Crow's take secrets to the grave. No one told her. So I asked her. I said "why did you do it?" She looked me dead in the eyes... She said... "Uncle Eddie, because I was born to kill." - Are you serious? - As serious as a heart attack. Oh my God! Freddy, do you believe in fate? - What do you mean? - Fate. You know, destiny... Ah... Not really mate. See, I do. It's all meant to be. Everything that happens to us... It's all part of the big plan. I truly believe that. It was fate, that killed my family in the fire. It was fate, that brought you here. Your car, was always going to break down. It's destiny, you're here. Don't you think? - I dont know. - Something to think about. Yeah... I need to take a shit. Oh, fuck that! I had such a fun night with you. Such a shame we can't do it again. Now you're going to have a nice sleep, okay? - Hello. - Oh, fuck off. Don't you want to play with me? You did last night, you cunt. Oh please, help me. Please... Fuck that, mate, you're on your own, cunt. Please... Just fucking kill me. We can play hide and seek! Come out, come out, wherever you are! Come on, boy, come on. I know you're here. Where are you?! You... It's like I said Freddy, it's all part of the plan. Cherry! I found him. You'll fucking pay for this, you son of a bitch. I somehow doubt that. Good job! You people are fucking insane! That's what they all say. We've had that our whole life! - Haven't we sweetheart? - Yes, daddy. Daddy? You said you were her fucking uncle. Uncle, dad and uncle-dad... It's all the same around these parts. Hey, I have a couple of bits of advice for you, Frederick. Number one, don't fuck your sister. Number two, don't fuck your sister twice! You fucking inbred scum! Hey, that's enough out of you. Now, Cherry... You do your thing, okay? Fuck you, you fucking bitch! You've got about 5 seconds to regret that. Oh yeah? Eat my fucking balls! Eat this! Oh, that was a bit of fun, aye? The others are all dead too. My Cherry Pie. Woah, looks like he might have a bit of meat on him too. I bet he'll taste real sweet. Oh, sweety. - Hello there. - Hello. How can I help you? Uhh, we saw your advertisement for a fruit picking job... We were wondering if room is still available for board? Umm, yes, we would like the job very much. - Very, very much. - Please... Umm... You, my friends, are in luck. Come inside. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. So the room available is upstairs- What was that? Umm, what was a that? That was the twins, don't mind them. They're just a bit funny in the head, that's all. How long have you been in Australia? - Umm, 6 days. - Oh, really? - Uh, a no, ye-yes. - You're going to love it here. - Oh... - Huh? - It's Tuesday. - Hmm? - It's bingo night. - Oh, bingo!
