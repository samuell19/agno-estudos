(typing) - [Journalist Voiceover] September 30th. Byline: Tom Corman. When I was in journalism school, I was taught to be prepared for anything out of the ordinary. And when I took the position on this small town newspaper, all I expected was the ordinary. Outside of a few wildlife arrests and local drunken rowdiness, nothing much ever happened here to write about. That was before strange things started occurring in this sleepy little town. And now, nothing will ever be the same again. (man clears throat) - [Woman] Yes, Mr. Griffith? - [Mr. Griffith] Can we put our backs into it, Ms. Griffith? - [Ms. Griffith] We're doing our best! You must be patient! - [Mr. Griffith] Patience is a virtue, Ms. Griffith, but it won't keep the sun from rising. We've much to do before we rest, and we've all got to get it all done before daybreak. - [Ms. Griffith] May I venture an opinion, Mr. Griffith? - [Mr. Griffith] You may, Ms. Griffith, but I council you to conserve your breath for more fruitful endeavors. - [Ms. Griffith] Well my opinion, Mr. Griffith, is this. We're on a fool's mission. They ain't no gators in this swamp. They ain't been for months. I know this is so, for no one, including those of us who look for 'em ain't seen one since September. - [Mr. Griffith] Your reasoning, Ms. Griffith, is both childish and unscientific. Now, when one no longer sees gators where once there were many, it means one of two things. One, the gators have all moved, which is highly unlikely, for such a migration would have been noticed. The other is that they all died and their carcasses sank to the bottom. You know, when a gator dies, it just doesn't up and blow away like an old dandelion. It leaves its skin behind. Now, this place we're going to was teeming with gators less than a year ago. Therefore, reasonable to assume that that's where we'll find the mother load. - [Ms. Griffith] Well I don't see what would make so many gators die all at once. - Pollution, my dear. Disease, starvation, old age, any number of causes. Okay. Kindly stop the boat here Ms. Griffith. Time for me to go to work. May I have the gun, please, Ms. Griffith? For what we're about to receive, may the good Lord make us truly grateful. (revolver firing) (chuckles) Observe. Ms. Griffith, could you please? - [Ms. Griffith] Are you sure it's dead? - [Mr. Griffith] The cold light of science, my pet, assures me there can be no other way. - [Ms. Griffith] Kinda strange, Mr. Griffith. - [Mr. Griffith] Say again, Ms. Griffith. (splashing) Ms. Griffith? Ms. Griffith? Ms. Griffith! (eerie music) - So anyway, I said to her, I said, "I'm not boring you am I?" And she said, "No, not at all." I'm telling this ridiculous story-- - Okay, everybody up against the wall. All right, we know it's no use, warden. We surrender. - What are we surrendering for this time? - For killing a damn good story, that's what. - Oh really? And what story was that? - The one about the 18-pound bass that I caught at Black Hammock. - Huh? - I'm sorry. He brought the pictures in, but I filed them and forgot about them. - Where are they filed then? - "I" for implausible. - Here they are. - Never seen a bass like that before. Are you sure that's what it is? - Am I a game warden or not? Of course I'm sure! - [Journalist] Yeah, but look closely. No, you see these lines here and here? That's the early development stage. Now, a bass loses those lines when it reaches the adult stage. But this bass is a whopper! - Well, you're right there. But you know, this may be the biggest baby bass ever caught. - But what would make a baby bass grow like that so fast? - [Journalist] Well I don't know, but I think Miller here is under arrest. Isn't there a law about keeping baby fish? - Sure there is, but not when the baby fish is this size, doc. - Hey, maybe that's the monster everybody's been talking about. (laughing) - That thing? - Or it's mom. - Listen, I'm going over to Kowalski's. You want to go with me? - Why would I? - Well, we're gonna play poker tonight. - I think I'll pass. - Okay, I'll tell Tom you said hello. - Tom? I thought he was working tonight. - Yeah, he is. He's working with Kowalski on that bridge thing. - Good luck to him. - 'Fraid so. - Have a good game. - Okay, you bet. - Good night. - So, anyway, I'd said to her, I'm telling this long, ridiculous story about the collar, you know? And so I look over, five minutes later ... - I'll take three. - Then you don't think, sheriff, that the McGovern Bridge should be rebuilt at all, do you? - What I think, son ... Whoa, man! Three bullets! - Damn! That put my out. - What I think, son, is none of your concern. - Or my papers. - That's right, or your papers. - But sheriff, the people have a right to know. - Let me tell you something, son. Would you shuffle those? Let me tell you the truth. I haven't given very much thought to the bridge lately. - You mean you haven't given much thought to anything. - And when I do, I'll let you know, okay? Now, you want to get even? - Yeah. - Damn right! - Then shuffle the cards, shuffle the cards. - Sheriff! - Whoa! Wait! Wait, Cambell! It's only old Griffith! Old Griff. Come to turn yourself in, huh? - Oh god, sheriff. Oh my god! - Sheriff, he seems a little upset. - Yeah, upset. Probably bad conscience. - What's wrong, Mr. Griffith? - Mrs. Griffith. My Margaret. Oh, it's terrible! - What's the matter? What's the matter there, Griff? One of them gators chomp on your old woman, huh? - It wasn't no gator. Something got her out there, but it wasn't no gator. - Ain't been no gators in them swamps in ages, sheriff! - Course there's gator, probably asleep hibernating. You know, if there's a gator out there, old Griff will sure find him now. - What was it, Mr. Griffith? - I never seen nothing like it before in my life. It's a rotten monster! - You dreamin' again there, Griff? - Well maybe so. But ever since that big house boat sank in the swamp, well, nothing's been the same around here since. (sighs) And now my Margaret. - Where it was this? - Way out there where all in gators used to be. - Well look, I'll take you out to Doc Ellerbe's house. He'll fix you up with a sedative. And after a good night's sleep, maybe you can give me some directions or a map. - No, believe me, you don't want to go out there! - Don't worry. It'll be broad daylight. I've got to check into this. Now let's go. (grumbles) - Want a rematch? (dog barking) - Go on out. Beau? Come on, baby! Beau! Beau? Beau? (clattering) Beau? Hell. (startling music) (soft music) (shouts) - You gave me quite a fright! - [Tom] Well I'm sorry! - You oughtn't be creeping up on people like that. - Hey, I didn't mean to scare ya. - Hey, do you think you could possibly help me get out of this mess? - Walk on out where it's firmer. - I'm afraid I can't. My shoes are stuck. - Well you'll just have to leave them. - In this muck? I just bought them! - I suppose we could get a helicopter to fly in and carry you out. - Very funny. (splashing) Whew! (girl chuckling) What's so funny? - [Girl] You. You look funny in those socks. (grumbles) - [Tom] Hey, wait a minute! Just who are you anyway? - My name's Shawn Michaels, and my pappy is Emmett Michaels. - Old Emmett Michaels? - That's right, and he'll shoot you like a hound if you so much as lay a hand on me. - Please, I'm Tom Corman. I'm with the local newspaper. - So what? - Well I'd like to talk to your father and ask him a few questions if that's okay with you. - I don't mind, but pappy might shoot you. - Why? I haven't touched you. - I know that. But if there's one thing my pappy don't hold too much store in, it's that newspaper of yours. - Is it because we expose poachers and other abusers of wildlife? - Nope. It's 'cause my pappy can't read. - Can you read, Shawn? - I can read what's on your mind. And if I had a gun, I'd shoot you too. - Well look, I'd like to talk to him and see if he knows anything about the houseboat or some of the other strange things that have been happening here. - Okay, there's the house. Hey pappy, I'm home! - Who's that with you? - I'm Tom Corman, sir. I'm with the local newspaper. - He wants to ask you some questions. - [Emmet] Do you always walk around in a swamp in your stocking feet? - I'd like to ask you a few questions, Mr. Michaels. - I guess you want to know about the big one. - [Tom] Well, I ... - Everybody's always wantin' to know about the big one. You know what I tell them? - [Tom] No, sir. - I tell 'em Eddie Rickenbacker was a son of a bitch and y'all can mind your own damn business. - Actually, I'm looking for Margaret Griffith. - [Emmet] That's what they all say. - It is? - Damn right it is! I didn't know then, and I don't know now! - [Tom] Sir, she just disappeared last night. - If there's a live gator in that swamp out there he's in her, the way she used to whomp on him. - Then they are poachers. - Well, if you call never catching nothin' poaching, I guess they are. - So, what happened to all the alligators? That swamp used to be ass deep in gators. - If you'll stay for supper, I might just be a mind to tell you. - Of course he'll stay for supper. I got something special planned. - [Emmet] Well? - Um ... I ... Sure. I'd be delighted. - I've lived down in this swamp all my life. About 80 years. And I've seen some things that'll just curl your hair. - And what do you think happened to the alligators? - That goes back to the big one. I chased Eddie Rickenbacker out of the swamp, and we had a big dog fight right near here. Eddie crashed his plane, chock full of vials of secret germ warfare material. - But they didn't even have germ warfare until World War II. - I know that! That's 'cause I shot Eddie down in the big one. This germ stuff mutated the possums until they grew real huge. The Indians call 'em possotec. - Passotec? - Loosely translated, it means a giant possum, I reckon. Hell, what do you think I am, an Indian expert? - But Mr. Michaels, there haven't been an Indians in these parts in hundreds of years. - I know that. Hadn't been any gators either. The possums eat 'em up, best that I can tell. - That's totally absurd. - That's what I used to say. - Well, what do you say now? - I say it's silly. I don't like big words. - This conversation is getting us nowhere. And by the way, Shawn, this dinner is really good. What is it? - Possum. - Hate 'em. Hate 'em. - What? Uh, I'd like to go for a walk now. - Wait'll I get my pipe. - Don't bother, pappy. I'll go with him. (upbeat bluegrass music) - Are you ready to go? - Hell no, I ain't ready to go! - You've already lost five games. - I know that! But I gotta win my money back! Besides, Joe and I are going for that big gator later on. - But it's getting dark! - Well, ain't no better time to hunt gators than when it's dark. - Your luck, your gun'll end up backfiring into your ugly face. - Listen, woman, I don't need you to tell me when I can go hunt gators and when I can't! - But I am not about to walk home in the dark by myself! - Well I'll be out in that swamp, have that gator in my boat, and that money in my pocket before you can get your little butt moved off that stool. - But it's dark! - Well you can just wait for me right here. - And you can just kick my ass! - Go on, see if I care. (unsettling electronic music) (breathing heavily) (screaming) (screaming) (snarling) - You know, I really wish I could find out what happened to old Margaret Griffith. - But daddy already told you. - Well you don't believe in that giant possum stuff do you? - Don't you? - Of course not! Besides, if one possum grew big they'd all grow big. - Maybe so, but I try not and think on it too much myself. - What do you think about Shawn? - I don't know. Growing up, getting out of the swamp, eating hamburgers, stuff like that. - That's really nice, but do you know what I'm thinking of? - I already know what you're thinking of. - Oh really? Oh yeah. - Listen! - Oh, it's probably just some gator. - Or a possotec. - Knock that off! It's probably just some big gator. But let's check it out anyway. (soft music) - Tom, I'm scared. - Listen, if it's possotec, I'll eat my hat. - Well I don't see anything. - Hold on, I'll roust him up. (unsettling music) (screaming) (door closing) - Get a man up in the middle of the night to come look. I want to tell you somethin', Corman! This better be important now! - it is, sheriff. We found Mrs. Griffin. - Yeah? - [Shawn] That's right, sheriff. Out in the swamp. (sniffling) - Out in the swamp, hey? - Eh. That ain't Mrs. Griffith. - It's not? - Of course it's not. This here's a redhead. Mrs. Griffith is a blonde. - Hey Bernie, that looks like blood to me. - Yeah, it could be. Maybe this is Grip's old wife. - Should I ... (club bangs) round him up for questioning? - Yeah, I guess you better. - Sheriff, have you got any idea what made those marks on her body? - What do you think I look like now? What do you think I don't like, Corman? Of course I don't know! But could be murder one. - Well I guess we've got a big day ahead of us then tomorrow. - What do you mean we've got a big day tomorrow? - Well we're going to investigate the swamp, aren't we? (chuckles) - I don't see why. - Well I'll tell you what, sheriff. I'm gonna investigate the swamp. (upbeat bluegrass music) ♪ Now I recall now things were ♪ ♪ A couple years ago ♪ - Feeling any better Griff? You know, we found your old lady. Well that young newspaper reporter and Emmet Michael's daughter, they found her. Found her down at the old stomping grounds. - Was she ... - Oh, she's deader than Mother's Day at an orphanage, Griff. - I don't understand. Who could've done such a horrible thing? - [Campbell] I was kinda hopin' you could tell us. - You don't think that-- - I don't think so, but chief wants me to bring you in anyway. I'll tell you one thing, though, Griff. Her face looked like a plate of corned beef and cabbage. Hey, Griff, if you want to get a bite to eat, I hear they're running a good something special. (heaving) Hey, you take your time now, Griff. I ain't in no hurry. (heaving) ♪ Please don't cry ♪ ♪ We can go back today ♪ - Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy? Come here, I got something for you. (smacks) - What'd you do that for, woman? - Jimmy, you get over to that wood pile and cut that wood right this minute! - Well I'm goin'. - Next time it's gonna be your head. - I'm goin'. (eerie music) (chopping wood) - Jimmy, are you chopping that wood? (eerie music) (upbeat bluegrass music) (whistling) - What do you want? - How 'bout you and I ... have a little date tonight? - Drop dead, creep. - [Campbell] Well you sure do have a way with words Amy Lou. - I did graduate from high school, didn't I? - [Campbell] You know, folks say you and I would make a nice pair. - Pair of what? - [Campbell] Paraplegic. (chuckles) - Shut up, Campbell. You gonna buy anything or not? - Here you go, honey. Drinks are on me. - What? - Drinks are on me. - Well thank you honey. (chuckling) - What are you guys laughing about? (chuckling) As you were. - I really don't know what we're doing out here. I don't even know what we're looking for. The more I'm out here, the more I'm convinced there's just nothing to see. - Let's not look then. - Let me glance around some more, okay? - Oh! - You know, there's nothing moving anywhere around here. - Yeah, you're right. It's awfully quiet out here. (splashing) - What was that? - Probably just a fish jumping. - Yeah. (scraping) - What was that? - Maybe the gators are back. - Tom! - Damn. I'm gonna check this out. - Careful. Remember what happened to you last time you did that. - Shit. God! - Tom! - Let's get the hell outta here. Get that anchor up. - Come on! What was that? - I don't know. Shit. - [Shawn] Did you see that? - [Tom] I sure did! - [Shawn] Was it what I think it was? - [Tom] I don't know, but the chances are pretty good. Ah, damn, there's that schmuck Kowalski up there. What's up, sheriff? - I just thought you folks would like to know ... Griffith case is solved. - It is? - Well we sure do appreciate you coming out here on our behalf, sheriff. What do you think happened? - Well, old Doc Ellerbe got to looking at poor Mrs. Griffith there, and he thought the wounds were made by some kind of ... some kind of animal. - [Tom] Did he know what kind? - No, you know Doc Ellerbe. (chuckles) Couldn't make head nor tail. It seems obvious to us. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. A renegade gator. - A renegator. (chuckles) - Will you shut up, Campbell? Just be quiet! - Look, sheriff, it couldn't possibly be an alligator. - Well what the hell do you think it is, boy? Possotec? - Sheriff, it couldn't possibly be an alligator. The idea of this alligator thing is totally ridiculous. - Ah. You and the doc both. I must be right. - Look, Kowalski, we saw them. - Saw what? - The things that killed Mrs. Griffith. - Uh-huh. What things? - Well, they were people, things. I don't know, we only saw 'em for a second. - Uh-huh. - That's right. They tried to overturn the boat! - [Kowalski] Did you see ... Did you see those monsters, Shawn? - Sure did! I think. - Now, you mean to tell me that Margaret Griffith was killed by those monsters that only you saw? - [Tom] They also killed off all the alligators in the swamp. - Oh, come on now. - [Tom] And the Indians. - And the Indians. Let's go, Campbell. Oh, by the way. I just put a bounty on that there gator, in case you all was interested in some honest money. - [Tom] Sheriff, are you nuts? You'll have a swamp full of hicks out here shooting at each other if you do that. - Shooting at each-- Let me tell you something, boy! Better shooting out in the swamp than in town there! What do you want me to do, go out there and ... go out there and get bit by all them mosquitoes? - But sheriff, you can go up there and to that like you-- - Do that like I do what? Good hunting. Goodbye! - [Shawn] Kowalski, you jerk! - Come on, Shawn, forget it. Let's get this boat beached before the tide comes in. - Look, Tom. This was on the propellor. - Don't drop it! It might've come off one of those things we run over! - Hey, you know, you're right. I wonder if there's some place we could take this stuff and find out what it is. Do we have a biologist in town anywhere? - I guess the closest thing we'd have to a biologist would be Miller Haze, the gaming warden. - Hey, you're right! Let's take this over to him and he can maybe tell us what it is, all right? (men laughing) - Look, look, look. Hey, Miller, what you up to? - Oh, not much, Paisely. Just gonna do a little fishing. - Oh yeah? You got a license, warden? (laughing) - What are you guys up to anyway? - Oh, we're goin' off to hook that big gator. - Oh? Think you're gonna catch him? - Sure shootin'. (laughing) - You know I don't recall issuing Krelboin a license. - Oh he ain't gonna do no shootin', warden. - No? - No, he's just gonna look. (laughing) - Well, Paisley, you make sure that's all he does. And you guys be careful, you hear? - All right, Miller. Come on Krelboin, let's go get that big feller. (laughing) (thundering) - Hey Miller. Sounds like it's starting to rain out there. - Gordie, that's just a sun shower. Should be over soon. - Yeah, probably. What can I do for you? - How about some bait? Just a box will do. - Okay. Goin' fishing? - Might as well. There's not much else to do these days. - Not going on the big hunt? - Oh god! - Pretty sad, ain't it? - You know, Doc Ellerbe is sure gonna have his hands full these next few days. - Seems to me like a game warden ought to protest a situation like that. - It's about all I can do, is protest. That's just the kind of lip service that's the extent of my office. - Gordie, Kowalski never listens to me, never enforces any of my restrictions. About the only thing I can do these days is fish and peer through my microscope. I guess I feel retired. - What about Margaret Griffith? Do you think she really was killed by a gator? - Well, I didn't examine the body, but I'd be really surprised if there's been a gator. For one thing, there hasn't been a gator in these parts in months. But you know, that's beside the point. Ellerbe had some mighty weird things to say about that corpse. - Like what? Gordie, can you keep something under your hat? - [Gordie] It's a pretty big hat. - Well, I don't know what to make of this and neither does Ellerbe, but after he examined that body, he told me it was completely drained of-- - Miller! Thank goodness you're here! - We thought you must be here. We saw your tackle loaded up outside. - Something I can do for you? - Take a look at what Shawn has there. - What is it? - We were hoping you'd be able to tell us. - We think it has something to do with what killed Mrs. Griffith. - Well we can take it across to my place and have a look. - That's what we're hoping you say. Let's go. - Gordie, we might be able to clear up this thing. You two come on, and we'll just let's get into it. - Okay. See you later Gordon. - [Gordie] Oh, Miller. - Oh, thank you, Gordie. (laughing) - [Paisley] That old Miller, hey, is he something, ain't he? - That boy cracks me up. I don't recall issuing Krelboin a hunting license. - Shit, that boy's a regular riot. Everybody knows you can't hunt alligators even with a license. - Hell, that never stopped nobody. - Yeah, well we're gonna get us this one and collect that big reward for ourselves. - Hey, just you be careful, now. Don't you go fuck it up. - Me fuck it up? You dumb hot head. I suppose you're gonna blame me for lousing up that bounty on that escaped convict, the one who come down from Masis County last year. - Hell, who you calling a hot head? If you'd a been awake, you'd a shot that boy and we wouldn't a had to be out here right now. - Shit, how was I suppose to know he was dressed as a nun? - Hell, you dumb turd, anybody knows there ain't no nuns around this part of the country. 'Sides, he was wearing prison boots. They were sticking right out from underneath that dress of his. - Yeah, well there's gonna be a boot sticking out of something else if you don't stop ribbing me and start looking for that renegade gator. - Hell, that Sheriff Kowalski, he don't know one gator from another. We'll just shoot the first one that comes along. - Yeah, well I hope one comes along real soon, 'cause I got a hankering for a cold six pack. - Shit, one old gator and we'll be ass deep in beer. Slow that boat down, son. I think I see one. - Where is he? (startling music) (splashing) - Shore up. Krelboin? (eerie music) (groaning) (disturbing music) - Well, it fits. - Fits what? - Well Doc Ellerbe told me that Mrs. Griffin's body was completely drained of blood. - But a body with wounds like that could easily be drained of blood. - Yeah, that's what I thought. But the doc said that the way the veins were collapsed, it looked as if the blood was, well, sucked out. - But these things looked like people! - You know, I might be crazy for saying it, but I think we oughta pay a visit to Mae Hawkins. - You mean that girl with the crazy story? - That's the one. Remember, she tried to tell everyone that some strange thing was crossin' the sky and hit that boat, but nobody believed it. - I don't make the connection. - I don't either. But you know, they never did find those dead people, just the wreckage. - See you over there. You comin', Shawn? - I'm comin', but I don't like the mess you're gettin' me into. - Well, let's just hope we're wrong. - Sheriff, I'm here at the highway and the 17 bridge. And I believe I've found the boat that belongs to Paisley and Crawford. It appears that there's also blood on the seats. You better get ahold of your Deputy Campbell and send him out here to investigate this situation. I'm 10-8 on another call, so I can't be of any assistance here. (mysterious music) - Deputy ID number one, unit two, where's your 10-20? Come in, unit two! Give me your 10-40 or your 10-20. Dog gone it, Campbell, where are you? - Sorry, Sheriff, I'm down here by the ... Checking out the swamp. I get a, uh ... A suspicious character under surveillance. - You can forget that surveillance, Campbell! I know you. Now, you get yourself back here, you hear? We gotta get out to Highway 17. There's something funny going on out there. - 10-4.

What brings all of you out here today? - I was just gonna ask you that. - Well as a matter of fact, I come out here every day. Mae's just had a dreadful experience. She's still under a terrible strain. - You don't think it could have anything to do with what happened in the swamp, do you Doc? - It's not for me to determine, Mr. Corman. - Then what, in your opinion, did cause it? - Well, whatever it was, it sure generated a lot of heat. As to its origin-- - I know, I know, no comment. Can we talk to her and see her, Doc? - I don't see why not. Let's find out. (knocking) Mae? It's Doc Ellerbe. - Come on in, Doc. Who's that with you? - The game warden, Miller Haze, and his friends. They want to talk to you. - Miss Hawkins, I want to know what you saw that night in the swamp. - Why should you? Everybody laughs and thinks I'm crazy. - Just what did you see, Miss Hawkins? - Hmm. Was cruising around with Bobby Phillips. You know, just driving around. Then he stopped the car.

Y'all just don't shoot each other. - Let's go, Carl. These women around here are crazy anyway. - That's why there ain't many of 'em around. - [Man] I reckon. (eerie music) (screaming) (screaming) (gun firing) - Pappy! - Emmett! Get in the truck, come on! (gun firing) Get outta here. Did you see those things? - [Miller] Damn, this is a lot bigger than I'd expected. - [Shawn] They were awful looking. - [Emmet] I'm mighty lucky you folks come along. I shot them bastards twice before they got that girl, but it didn't do no good. - [Tom] Girl? Do you know who it was? - [Emmet] Not really. I was kinda surprised seeing those things, whatever they were. - [Shawn] They were the bulls, pappy! - [Emmet] No fooling? - [Miller] Yeah. The thing we gotta do now is find out how to kill 'em. - [Tom] But they're dead already, Miller. - [Shawn] Let's go get the sheriff. - [Miller] Oh, you've got to be kidding. - [Emmet] You're right, Haze. That boy Kowalski is about as lazy a sheriff as we've ever seen. - [Miller] The point is we've got to decide on a plan of action. - [Shawn] We can go on over to our place and work on it there. - [Miller] Hey, good idea. As I recall it's not too far from here. - [Tom] About a mile, I guess. You know, this is still crazy as hell. I mean, nobody would ever believe such a story. - [Emmet] I tried to tell everyone about lettin' them Yankees flood in here like it was the Fourth of July. - [Shawn] Yeah, and they're suckin' our people's blood too. - [Miller] That's not the half of it. It just might prove to be even worse than we anticipated. - [Tom] What do you mean Miller? - [Miller] Well, providing it was a meteorite that revived the dead people, it could have the same mutating effect on other forms of life. - [Tom] Hell, maybe we just better make a beeline for Georgia and forget all about fighting this thing out. - [Emmet] I don't think we've got much choice. Look up there. - [Miller] Hey. That looks like Doc's car. It is Doc's car! Hey, look on the side there. Doc? (unsettling music) (gun firing) - Tom, Tom! Tom! Tom! - Tom! Miller! (screaming) (gun firing) (shouting) - [Tom] Up ahead there's a house! - Hey, boys, look here! It's Doc Ellerbe! - [Miller] Alive? - Yeah, but he's hurt mighty bad. Y'all stay here. Hey Doc, come on with me. Oh my God! (screaming) - Pappy! Pappy! - Forget it, Shawn! - Pappy! Pappy! (suspenseful music) (pounding) - Hey, open up for God's sake! - Let's barricade this door. - Get this bed. I'll check all the windows and rooms. - All right, I'll stay by this one. - Tom! Tom! Tom! Oh! No! (crying) (yelling) - Shawn! - Oh my God! Help me, please! - Look, we're safe for right now, but I wonder for how long. - We should have made that beeline for Georgia. - These windows aren't gonna hold them off for very much longer! - [Tom] They're just ... They're just waiting. Just standing around. - What are we gonna do? - Maybe we can make it to the car. - No! - Look. I can hold them off with this while y'all go out through the back. - No, Miller, it's too dangerous. - We don't have any choice! Will you get the hell outta here! - Okay, okay, you be careful though. - Don't worry about me. Just get the hell out! Take this. (eerie music) (booming) (screaming) - You ready? This way, this way. (shouts) Keep going, come on. (shouting) (shouts) - Boat! (shouts) (disturbing music) (yelling) (mysterious music) - [Kowalski] What are y'all doing out there? Digging for frogs? - [Campbell] Maybe they's looking for killer toads. - [Kowalski] Oh, come on, will you, Campbell. You haven't seen the game warden, have you? - He's dead. - [Kowalski] Corman! What are y'all dreaming up? - Looks like a dead end here sheriff. - Yeah. These newspaper people are fools. Dreamers and fools. (chuckles) Come on, Campbell.
