My fellow Christians, it is my pleasure to announce to you the future union of Jean Freiha and our very own Noha Elias. Anyone who wishes to stand against this marriage, please speak now or forever hold your peace. I believe in God, the Father Almighty. Maker of Heaven and Earth... Oh! I love to see you, lovely decent ladies! That family is lucky to have you. I'm so happy for you! Although I'm a little upset. Couldn't you have told me earlier? You know I'd be thrilled to see you as a bride. Aunty Olga, you know I love you but l couldn't... Of course, dear. I'm not mad. I just felt a little pinch, I can't help it My congratulations. You deserve the best. Besides, I don't need an invitation. If I want to attend your wedding, I'll do it, without asking anyone's permission. I wish! That would be lovely. She usually attends the earlier mass. I felt really bad in front of her. -I really like Olga. -Not as much as she likes you. She couldn't take her teary eyes off of you, poor thing. It seems she doesn't accept that you and her nephew Joseph are over. It's been three years! We don't want to have worry about him too! I called him, the day before yesterday. Excuse me? Joseph, I called him and I'm going to meet him this afternoon. And? I don't know. I will kill you. That's his car. He's back. -He left the windows open. -He must have fallen asleep. Asleep? He must've been in a rush to clean up for you. Don't be so ridiculous. I'm going to see my baby... Wadad, stop it! Don't look up. His mom's on the balcony. What's she doing? She's looking in the closet. With a cigarette in her mouth, right? How ugly! If only God could throw rocks... She took out the charcoal. Some poor birds are going to be barbecued today! She spent five years stalling. I turn thirty and it hits her that I'm older than her son. She knew that. He always threatened to kill himself if he lost you. I'd like to see him do it. If he were man enough, he'd have done it. I'm not going to see him. Don't be silly! Forget this. Go see him and be happy! Seriously, Wadad? "Go be happy"? As if... What? You called him. You miss him and want to see him. Right? -Wrong. -Fine, don't go then. You know we're going to visit your sister this afternoon? No, I don't. I'm busy this afternoon. Besides, no one told me. What? Didn't I tell you what happened yesterday? Yeah, you did. And then you said she was ok. If she says she's ok, it doesn't mean it's true. For God's sake! I'm not a mind reader! We didn't plan to visit her. We need to plan to visit your sister who's had a miscarriage? Four miscarriages in two years! Her uterus is like a sieve now! They might take it out! -Is that my problem? -Yes! I spend all day at home alone, while my daughter is lying in bed, shattered. If only she weren't a million miles away And you stand there trying to be Don Juan! When you clearly can't pull it off. Honey, it looks like the perfect fit to me. No, it needs to be tightened from here. This bra gives her more cleavage Then you have to loosen the sides a little. Yeah, so what? We can loosen the back. We haven't sewn the zipper, I can add more fabric to the back. If we're going to show this dress, It can't look altered. Turn around, slowly. No one's seen this dress. No one has to know it was originally tailored for you. Except Laurice, God rest her soul. The amount of time she worked on it and she wouldn't take a dime. It doesn't take a genius to know it's out of style. Says who? A dress like this never goes out of style. Besides, you can't find this fabric anywhere these days. I spent a fortune on it, back in the day. I found it at “Taksheh”, in the old souk, never wore it. Poor old souk... I put it on once. The first time I tried it on. That same day Melhem and I called it off and that was it. It was all everyone could talk about. Your son scared him off. Oh please! Stop it! She wasn't yet his wife, he had no right. It was between her and her brother. I don't wish him well. But he's doing well! Happily married with kids. He named his eldest Layla. Jolly! He became all stubborn, "We either elope or you never see my face again!" That's no way of proposing. I've got my pride, too. Thank you, Laurice, but this dress seems like a deal breaker! Oh God! Darling, don't be so ridiculous Ridiculous? Did I go to Fatmeh or did you? She told you, "Layla's going to end up an old spinster. Just like your neighbor who cursed you for being in love with your husband." Wasn't that Laurice? Yes, it was. Sister, take it off. Don't do me any favors. My dress is cursed? Fine, I'll live with it. But the day Joseph's mother kicked you out, in front of her son who didn't budge you weren't wearing my dress. I lost my man because I didn't want to dishonor my parents, unlike you who embarrassed us all. Here's your dress. You call yourself my sister? To hell with you. My own family can't back me up! And who's backing me up? Or is it ok when it's about me? I was talking out of love for you. Shame on you, Layla. Shame! It's Noha. Your baby sister! Noha, where are you going, honey? Noha, answer me! Noha, where are you going? It's noon! It's too hot! Answer me, Noha. I'll never forget that night. Melhem was over and we were all having a good time. When my brother Assaf rushes through the door to shower and take Siham out dancing at St. Georges. He finds his clothes not ironed and yells at me. Obviously, it bothered Melhem! My younger brother humiliating me in front of him? He couldn't take it and left. Noha, you're so mean! Poor guy wondering if you're gonna show up and you're just watching. He's just across the street. Get moving or he'll leave. -I'm going to tell him. -Don't! I don't want him to know that you or anyone know. I'll just tell him something came up. It's not fair. Be quiet, he's looking our way. Busted! Oh please! He's leaving. Oh great, he's coming. Wadad, what do we do? Calm down, he doesn't know you're here. Go hide in the stairwell. As soon as I let him in, you climb down and go wait by his car. Now? After he's gone? Come in. What do I do with you, idiot? I really wanted to see him. So go back and wait. He's bound to come back. Are you kidding? He must think I stood him up. Stop blabbering. Just go! -Too big? -No, they suit you. Are you going to stay mad at me the whole way? I'm not mad, really I just thought you were standing me up, that's all. I told you I had a fight with them at home and I couldn't leave. I believe you. It's fine I thought of going to Wadad's, to ask her. Then I figured it wouldn't be nice to go unannounced. Good you didn't. I didn't tell anyone Me neither. Not even Asmar. I wanted to tell him today, but I didn't. Did you go hunting together? Yes. Didn't I tell you? No, you said you were going hunting. You didn't say with whom. I thought I did. -And how was hunting? -Very good. We got there early, there was no one else around. Asmar is a good guy. -You see him a lot? -Not as much as before. He's been busy lately. He's getting married. Really? I thought that was it, after Elham. It's all talk! He met this girl, a Damour refugee. A friend of his cousin. He seems smitten. Good, maybe he'll rub off on you a little. I can't promise you. But I'll do my best. Today, after mass, your aunt came up to me. She's upset I didn't invite her to my wedding. Why didn't you? Seriously? She barely contained her tears today. You know she hasn't spoken to my mom since? It's too bad. I'm not worth it. Where are you getting married? Harissa. Nice. -Are you happy? -About what? The wedding, the groom... Yes, I'm happy. Don't you worry. -Why did you ask to see me? -I might call it off. I'm ready. Take your time. Actually, the day you called, I'd had a dream about you. Thanks. And what was I doing? Nothing. We were in the car, just like this. But you were driving. -And what happened? -I don't know. When I woke up, I remembered it vividly, but now, nothing. It must've been something ugly. Or something silly. That too. Come on, Noha, stop crying. I'm not crying. I'm not crying so you can comfort me, Joseph. It's my fault. I shouldn't have called you and we shouldn't have met. I needed to see you because I was scared. I wanted to tell you that I'm scared of getting married and I still love you I thought I'd be stronger. What are you going to say about me now? What am I going to say? You're seriously asking? Yeah. Dragging you here, two weeks before my wedding. What's the point? It makes no difference to you, right? How's this going to affect you? Tell me. I'd rather not. Right. Why do I bother? It's always been easier for you to stay silent. What do you want me to say? Nothing. You watched your mom kick me out of your house and did nothing. Don't look at me like that. This time you have no reason to lay a hand on me. This is pointless. I don't want to get married. I don't want to be anyone's wife. Freeze! Hands up! You alone? Yes, I am. Where do you live? On Sidd el Boshriyeh. Whose side are you on? No one's. What do you do? I'm a carpenter. And what brought you here? Just getting some air. I've had a rough day. I come here a lot, I didn't know it was forbidden now. Well, now you do! Next time you'd better cry in your own neighborhood. Yes, sir. Are you mocking me? You fucking asshole! -On your knees. -Man, I said, "Yes, sir!" On your knees! Get up! Get back in your car and drive before us. Drive where? You'll see. We're right behind you. If you look back, I'll shoot you. Well done, my dear! Well done! Where have you been? We looked all over for you. We thought you were with Wadad but that tramp said she hadn't seen you. Stop screaming, mother. I'm not ten. I know what I'm doing. A ten-year-old knows better than you. Did you forget about tonight? We didn't tell your brother. Your sister went ahead before us to distract him. Distract him from what? He lives a minute away, we're not even late. But we are! You still need to change. Is your plan to arrive with the guests? Aunt Noha. Aunt Noha, can you come for a bit? Coming. Where are you, sweetie? In mom and dad's room. Mony? Aren't you the cutest! Gorgeous! Turn around... Beautiful. Let's take them off so we don't ruin them. No, please wait. We want to practice carrying the train. What train? You put this white sheet on your shoulders and we walk behind you carrying the rest of it. Honey, now's not a good time. Please, for me. Aunty, say yes, say yes. Next time you come over, we'll try with the real train. I'm not feeling well, today. I have a headache. Ok, Mony, let's be nice. Aunt Noha seems sad. Aunty, this sting will go away in no time. It will be gone before the wedding. It's not the sting. Aunt Noha is sad because Uncle Jean is old. If she marries him, she'll have to live in his house and sleep next to him. Don't talk like that. Uncle Jean's is your dad's age. -Is your father old? -No, daddy's not old. But daddy's handsome. Uncle John isn't. Why does he laugh like that? He scares me when he laughs. This is how he laughs, what's it to us? And what's it to him to take you away? He'll sit you in his supermarket, and we'll never see you again. What's going to happen to Mony and me at school, without you? Don't worry, sweetie. The teachers there are my friends. And they know you and love you. You were going to be my teacher next year, in 5th grade. Not anymore. I wish you wouldn't get married, Aunty. Will you come already! They're here. I heard them. What are you doing? Take them off now, you hear? Aunt Noha said it's okay. Aunt Noha didn't work hard on them. Let me do it. The organza is a tricky fabric. It was Camelia's idea. Stop pointing fingers! You're both ladies now. Let's dress you up and brush your hair, so you can go say hello. Bonsoir. Please don't get up. How are you feeling? Better, thank you. How are you, Raymond? So, till when? Your wedding day, I promise. I'll shoot you if you shave it off. -Bonsoir, Colette. -Bonsoir, how are you, Noha? There's no way he's going to be best man looking like this! I was joking. What's that on your face? Nothing. A sting. What sting? Show me. A sting can do that? Tell me about it! This year, they're very different. -There are so many mosquitos. -It's a big one. It'll take time to heal. -Does it hurt? -A little. Feel better. Non, merci. I made them myself. The tangerines are from my in-law’s garden. No, really, I'm not into these things. -Me neither, merci. -Really? You're all turning me down? Have one if you like. You're lucky here. You should see my sister's neighborhood on Jisr-el-Basha. Mountains of dirt came out of that camp! -Colette will tell you. -Tell her what? How everyone fled the bad smells in your neighborhood. Not everyone, Aunty. Some people have kids and stayed. What did you do today? I stayed in. Me too. I closed the shop early and slept all afternoon. Come to me, I won't turn you down. I know. You get the biggest portion. Noha's always had sensitive skin. The smallest thing gives her a rash. Be it dust, bad smells. One time, her cheek got covered in spots. We went crazy. Remember, honey? She was just hitting puberty. No doctor could help. In the end, Doctor Riashi told me to change her pillow. And that was it. It turned out she was allergic to wool. Good! I don't like pillows anyway. Just the pillows? Yeah, right! Noha, his mattress always looks like a war survivor. God help you, my dear. What's going to happen to you? What's going to happen? Worse comes to worst, I come home and sleep in my bed. Don't you live in your own little bubble? Jean still falls off the bed. He'll be tamed as a husband, I'm sure. Of course! From now on, I'll only answer to the Mrs. "At ease, Soldier! On your feet, Soldier!" Oh, pardon us! Alexandra, didn't you notice the lady is smoking? Sorry. I thought she didn't smoke. I offered cigarettes earlier. -She didn't take any. -Don't worry, please. You don't have the kind I smoke. Mines are special. You're right, hand-rolled cigarettes are the best. George used to smoke them. -George, my brother. -God rest his soul. What a loss. Such a gentleman. When did he pass? His funeral was exactly nine months ago. What a funeral! As big as a wedding! We were so proud of him being a med student in France. We couldn't pay for his schooling. The government of France offered him a full scholarship. God knows what brought him back. He said, “If you're going down, I'm going with you." Two days later, they kidnapped him, the sons of bitches! They returned his body in pieces and we had to bargain for it! Good evening, everyone. My apologies. -I was busy with the kids. -You look gorgeous. I bet all men have their eyes on you. How do you keep them away? -All but your son. -I send them my sister. How are you, Raymond? When is that due? -A couple of days. -You should ask his fiancée. -Hello. Colette. -I figured. Pleasure to meet you. I've heard a lot about you, but seeing you is different. You're stunning! I've heard a lot about you too. Especially from Jean Oh, you don't want to listen to Jean. He's a natural born liar. Don't talk to me, I'm mad at you -Mad at me? What did I do? -Not now. Oh, I insist. Come say hello, darlings. Camelia, Mony, come here. -Hello. -Hi, sweetheart. -Hello. -Good evening. Look how pretty your dresses are! Great job, Layla. -Hello. -Good evening. What's your name, princess? -My name is Camelia. -And you? -Mony. -What a beautiful name! Good evening, Uncle Jean. Good evening, Camelia. How are you? Good. Come here. Come closer to your uncle! Where are you going? Come say hi. Come closer, Mony. Mony? Who do you think I bought these for? Ok, whoever gives me a “thank you” kiss, gets these. Go to your uncle Jean, kiss him and say thank you for the presents. Go! It's ok, they can take them later. Listen to your father. Take the presents, kiss him and say thank you. This is for Mony. And this one's for you. -What do you say? -Thank you. And my kiss? Why are you crying? Don't be rude. Take your presents and go to your room. Go on! Come on, buddy. It's my fault. I made them cry. You didn't do anything. They're just being cute. They cry at everything I say. Wow, your daughters are lovely, Assaf. Let's cut them some slack. The situation is bad as it is. Poor things... They've suffered a lot of shock in the past two years. It's a wonder they're still obedient. School's in one day and out for ten. They're not even learning at school. It's bad enough taking shelter in the hallway. God help us get through this. What God? If we don't stand our own, no one can save us. "Keep your doors open." We kept them open, they butchered so many of us. Such cruel people. They were willing to kick us all out. Like a spring. Once you let go, it bounces back and pokes you in the eye. And we're not even done. Two months of terror. Every night, we'd say "this is it". Fifty-two days! Till the very last day, our men were on full alert. Our men went in thinking they were 1,200 in the camp. But upon their arrival, 45 of ours died. Mines. The camp was surrounded with land mines. The shooters on Meer Hill would appear, shoot and disappear in the hill. Our tank driver got hit. He climbed on his friends' bodies. As they were withdrawing, the enemies surrounded them in Mansourieh and Hazmieh, they came out from their trenches. The second attack, our guys were prepared. They wiped out Baalbakiyeh Street with their Molotov. They had can houses but there were shelters underground. You could hear them screaming. They had it coming, those snakes! The red cross was in the camp and they didn't stop shooting. They kept attacking, supposedly to rescue their men. To hell with them! But our men were just as bad, even worse. They had every right. They were enraged! Come on! Dragging the naked bodies in the streets, in front of women and children! That's horrible! Shooting everywhere. And the stray bullets that killed so many on their balconies. It's unreasonable! With all due respect, words are easy. Their nerves were a wreck, all day. Countless sleepless nights! Kill or be killed! You think they dreamed of getting out alive? At least they should let it out. That's war for you, since the beginning of time. A warrior who came back without his enemy's head on a spear was killed by his own, because he shamed them. Unlike now, where he’s a ‘hero’ but the housewives are appalled. And the one who wraps his enemy in a jute sack while he's still alive, and kills him in the woods, what’s that? That has nothing to do with war. You're right. An atrocity like that has to do with the person who committed it. What atrocity? Where did you hear about that anyway? Oh, we'll be hearing many more of these, Son. God save us from each other. God is giving. The good ones will be spared. My grandfather used to say, "The world will never fall." And I say it's time for mloukhiyeh. The smell is such a tease! Of course, after you. Dinner is served. These mloukhiyeh are this year's goods. Hope you like them. Please, after you. Please. Please. Welcome. Please be seated. Welcome. We're honored to have you. Wow, Alexandra, it looks delicious. Of course we're going to like it! Aunt Noha is throwing up. She's dying. Alexa, check on her. Excuse me. Can you believe how rude? She went to bed. She threw up a lot? Doesn't matter. Bad timing. I'll handle it, go ahead. No way. You go back in so they don't get worried. I'll finish up and follow. It's amazing how you woke up right on time! When the guests are gone and the work's done. Let's hope it doesn't happen on the big day. It'd be rude to go without you. With or without me, no one's going anywhere. Don't worry. Excuse me? Come again. My wedding. Forget it. Canceled. I don't want to get married anymore. Not to Jean, or anyone. -I want to be a spinster like you. -You're wrong. No one's like anyone. Be grateful you found a decent man who'll have you. Well, he's into you. You can have him, and be grateful together. Shut up! Just shut up! Wadad told me who you were with all day. She was also worried. You were out too long. I don't care what she told you. Yeah, but I care. May I know who you were with all day? Why don't you ask your sister? She seems to know it all. Where do you think you're going? You're hurting me. Assaf! Let go! You’re hurting me! Mother! You're giving me attitude? What's gotten into you? Do you know who you're dealing with? What's the matter, honey? Tell me. Assaf, that's your sister, Assaf! Assaf, that's your sister, Assaf! Who? Who do you think you are? You're not my dad. You're not my dad! What gives you the right? What right do you have? Your hands are murderous ! Shut up, Noha. I will not! Don't patronize us. Do that to your daughters. You have no right! None! Don't touch me, I don't need you... Suck it up a little. If we don't put ice on it, it's going to swell up. You'll barely recover in time for the wedding. I told you! There will be no wedding! You think you can just say that? You slut. It's always “return to sender.” What are people going to say about us? To hell with you and the people. You're going to force me? Over my dead body! I wonder what that son of a bitch told you. Don't even think he'll marry you. He's a liar and a coward. Stop it, both of you. -What are you on about? -Shut up! I wish it were my funeral instead! You're such an idiot. A sadist and an idiot! So that's it. We're not done with Joseph Maroun. You spent the day with Joseph Maroun. You're still seeing him. You're still dating him. Get out of my house and don't let me see your face again. You're not my sister anymore, and I don't know you. Assaf... Whoever thinks I'm wrong can go after her. She forgot her purse. Her keys are in there. Wait up. I'm coming with you. No, stay. Get some rest. Stay with your brother. Tomorrow's a new day. Mother? Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! How hard! I wonder why! I wonder who's cursed us! From that day on, we never saw a good day. That was it. They say God helps the dead. I say the dead are in peace. God helps the ones who stay behind! Still the same? Yes, but her health is back and she's more in peace, you'll see. She zones out less. Sometimes we have normal conversations. When was she transferred? About a month ago. I insisted on her transferal. She's in a much better place now. The other floor was not for her case. Thank you so much, Sister Nawal. We're always troubling you. No trouble at all. It’s my job. Besides, Noha's dear to me. She's attached to you. Such a beauty, she's an angel! Well I'd like the angel to return my sister, please. God only knows. Last time, I told her I'd come back in a week. It's been much longer. Who knew we'd be at war again? God help us from all the chemicals they threw at us. All hell broke loose. You had to be there. Oh, we saw everything from up here. So many patients were abandoned by their families. My God! How heartless! You, when you couldn't come, you sent someone over. Who? I didn't send anyone. A young man. He said you had sent him. His name was... He told me his name is Maroun. Joseph came to visit her? Yes, Joseph Maroun. He spent two minutes with her and left. He broke. Did she recognize him? Not likely. Poor thing cried his eyes out. Serves him well. Why is he still following her? It's his fault she's here. It's no one's fault. It's God's will. Our Lord Almighty! My baby sister, my darling. Noha, as agreed, you're going to stay with your sister who's come to visit. She misses you, and I’m here for you. Merci, Sister Nawal. If you need anything at all, call me. Of course. Don't worry. I'll be fine. Sister Nawal is wonderful. She really loves you. She says you're doing better. Is that how you feel? You look great. This setting alone is a treat. You're mad at me, I know. You have every right. But I've planned to spend the whole day with you. I made a deal with the driver. My darling, how unfortunate! We went through our share of doctors and drugs as well as gossips and embarrassment. Assaf went nuts, banged his head against the wall! "It's all my fault!" Thank God, He sent him a baby boy to ease his pain. He came ten months after Mother died. Noha hasn't seen him. She doesn't know him. Noha no longer knows anyone. The last time I saw her, it was as if I were talking to myself. I spent the afternoon with her. I planned to go back the following week. But the war broke out again, even harder! And our house was the first bombed. Assaf lost it. Took his wife and kids, and fled to Cyprus. I went with them. Only with the clothes on my back. Our whole house burned down. Nothing was left of it. A few valuable items, I handed them to Sister Nawal. There was a lace suit among them I inherited from my late mother. What's ironic is that...
