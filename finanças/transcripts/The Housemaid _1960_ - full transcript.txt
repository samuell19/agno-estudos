Korean Literature Films Co., Ltd Look at this. A man in Gimcheon committed adultery with his maid. Men are hopeless, taking interest in a maid. I disagree. Look at us. We're almost totally dependent on our maid. She cooks and washes for us and is the first person to greet me. When I come home from work. She is fully at our service. Such thoughts should not be said or practiced in our sacred household.

Everyone! We all look absolutely worn out. What are we living for anyway? Our music club is the sole answer. Join our sports club and you'll get free noodles. The teacher of our music club is handsome. It gives us a thrill just to look at him. Noodles can't beat that! Give me the letter. What if he refuses? Music teachers are romantic. They are like a powder keg. This will set him off. We can't quit now. You must all be very tired. But singing is relaxing. We'll sing a Bohemian song today. Is anybody interested in piano lessons? I'll give you good instructions. I bought myself a piano and I need to make some money. Welcome you all. - The moment of truth! - My heart has just stopped! "Far beyond the autumn sky..." I need to go to the man's room. He must really be in a hurry. Are you aware of what this might do to her? Would you overlook such indecent behavior? - Messenger! - Yes. - Get Kwak Sunyoung. - Yes. Miss Kwak, the dormitory supervisor wants you. - Something's wrong. - Don't worry. Did you write this? A company rule calls for a three-day suspension. What? So long. I'm quitting, because of the music teacher! Are you leaving for good? I'm so ashamed. Love is nothing to be ashamed about. Wrong. The dormitory supervisor says I'm a disgrace. - Loving a married man... - She's crazy! - Crazy? - Yes. You've been so kind. - Do come back after a few days. - Yes Excuse me. Someone's at the door... - See who it is. - Don't want to. You want me to tear this? Don't say that. Encourage them. Don't kill their spirit. Dad, you have a guest. Honey! What brings you here? I want to take piano lessons. She gave me this. Come in. She wants to take piano lessons. How do you do. Excuse us. Our home is a mess. My second job keeps me from doing my housework. It's okay. I understand. We built a nice two-story house in the back. - You must have worked very hard. - If only he would realize that. Where's Changsoon? Aesoon, go find him. Have you ever played before? - No - I see. I don't know if I can teach you then. I told you to teach at the new house. I'll come back in a few days. Then I'll show you where the new house is. Okay. - Why did you turn on the light? - I'm not giving you any. - Pig! - Come on up if you want it. - Nah, nah! - Poor thing. She needs to exercise to get stronger. - Gimme. - Oops! - Moron! Cripple! - Pig! - Cripple! - You What did you say? I told you not to use that word. Raise your arms. This will be the living room. The floor will be lined with linoleum. It'll be lovely. Where do you live? In the dormitory, with Kwak Sunyoung. With Kwak? - Mom, my arm hurts. - You're being punished. Do as your father says. Something wrong? A student sent me a love letter. - You must be her first love. - Nonsense. The factory prohibits such things. - Look at that rat. - Where? You should date someone. You're too realistic. Aesoon! Aesoon! Changsoon lied about a rat. Raise your arms! Here's a letter from Kwak. Can you tell me what the letter says? I'm worried. She says she'll be back in a few days. Here. I didn't need to worry after all. I'm getting weaker. I didn't want to tell Mr. Kim that you were ill. He's not the kind of man to say kind words. We were foolish after all. A rosy dream can't bloom in late autumn when frosts form. Mr. Kim! I'm here for my lessons. Let me see your hands. Factory work has roughened them. Would I be able to play? Take special care of you hands daily. Use this for a week. You'll be surprised how well your fingers will move. First, like this. Press with your fingers. - Gimme! - Nah, nah! What's all the fuss? You're making me dizzy. Gotcha. - What? - Mom, mom! - What's the matter? - Mom I think I got too relaxed. A rat jumped at me. Get some rest. The house is too big. I need a housemaid. Can you get up, darling? - Darling? - My stomach. - Miss Cho! Call the doctor. - Okay. Darling. I feel dizzy. You've been working too hard... with the sewing machine for 10 years. Don't be silly. I'm happy. Just frightened by the rat. Miss Cho. Could you find us a housemaid? I'm tired of the housework. I'll try. I'm counting on you. Okay. What did he say? - Want me to find him a housemaid. - He asked the wrong person. Do, re Come out. - My smoking bothers you? - Girls shouldn't smoke. My coworkers taught me how. - It's a bad habit to follow. You'll go into a tailspin. - Tailspin? Goodness. That's the way of the world. How would you like to work for Mr. Kim as a maid? I don't know about working for a teacher. - But as long as you're paid... - How much? 5,000 hwan a month, including 1,000 hwan from me. I'll start packing. Me too. Me too. - You're better than mom. - You're the best, dad. Say, what're you kids? A jury? Hand me a plate. Be careful of this bottle. It's rat poison. Could you die from it? - Does this kill people? - Yes, it's poison. Take this to mom. - No rat poison in this, right? - Shut up! Gimme that. Yellow rice. Oh it's curry rice. Dad's great. I'm excited. Do you like it? "Two men eat, one man die. I don't know, you don't know." I don't get it. She means it's delicious. Come on, my boy! Ouch. A stone. Sorry. Ouch. - Sorry. - Ouch. Sorry. - I was lying. - Why you! - You're dropping... - Goodness gracious. We have a guest. Come on in. What's this smell? I'm doing the cooking today. - Isn't this curry rice? - Yes. Let me judge your cooking. Who's this? - Your housemaid. - I see. - How are you? - Welcome. - Mr. Kim made this, right? - Yes It was good except for the stones in it. - I saw a rat tasting it before us. - Bull shit. - Don't listen to her, dad. - I'm telling the truth. - I'll eat for you then. - No, you can't. I've brought you a maid. Not too bright, but a hard worker. Uh? Use the poison in the cupboard. - Goodbye, rat. - Put it down. Hey you, come out. - Ah! - What's wrong? Nightmare. Rats were dying from poison. But they had human faces. Hmm. Been having nightmares since I've been feeling better. Do you remember? That day you first came to my room? Your eyes made me want to give you anything. Yeah. Since then we've moved from a rented house to another. I can now relate to homeowners after becoming one myself. I don't want to give in anymore. So greedy. We deserve all this now. What's your next wish? Another son, and to send the children to college. That's a long way off. In the meantime, I should get enough sleep. - Honey. - Yes. Listen to me. Ugh, it's a rat! No, it's a squirrel. We'll keep it as a pet. I'll get some rice. Dad! - For me? - No, for Aesoon. - I hate rats! - Take a good look. This squirrel is a wild animal. It is humans who put them in cages. People thought caged life would immobilize them. But they exercise to keep their legs strong. You want me to exercise too, right? Thank you for the squirrel. - What are you looking at? - Give me some water. Don't drink that. - Why? - There's rat poison in it. Here. She's here. Miss Cho. Oh They are cookies. - Don't fight. - I'll give this to mom. I'm giving this to dad. Dad, Miss Cho's here. Getting along well with the family? I'm learning how to sew. Mrs. Kim will be a good teacher. You must be having fun, since your teacher holds - your hand to teach you. - What? Come in. I've been expecting you. - Mr. Kim! - Yes? - Are you busy? - No. - She has a bad habit. - What? - She smokes. - Really? Changsoon! Is this dad's? - Whose is it? - Mr. Kim asked me to get it for him. - She'll give it to him. - No, I will. - Dad, a pack of cigarettes. - Where did you get it? From the maid. She smokes, doesn't she? - Give it to her. - No. This is yours, right? Yes. Here. Here, have one. Go on. You don't seem like that kind of girl. My coworkers taught me at the factory. Why? So they could order me around by offering me a cigarette. I hope you learn something better here. I want to take piano lessons too. You must never touch the piano! Understand? Get some rest. You should offer tea to our guest. - She's a nice girl. - Yes. She's a hardworking student unlike most others. And she never comes empty-handed. She has bribed the kids. That's bad. I'll get you a cup of coffee. - Ouch, ouch! - What's the matter? Cramps, please massage my legs. Let's get rid of the sewing machine. It's not the sewing machine's fault. - It'll get us a television. - We don't need one. We can just go to the movies. When did you ever take me to the movies? That's why I want our home to have everything. I have an idea. Let's go visit your mother for a few days. She won't snub us now. In the morning, we'll demand eggs for breakfast. I'm all for it. Go to your room. I feel better now. Your arms must ache. Nothing compares with what women go through. Now you know. Do my shoulders now. Shh! I'll tell you a story. We went to my mother-in-law's orchard yesterday. She wanted us to eat all the pears on one of the trees. Why didn't you take us? We did our best, but I had to leave my family as hostages. Poor man. The dormitory supervisor wants you and Miss Cho. Kwak has passed away. She called your name from time to time. I couldn't afford sending my girl to school. I had to send her to the factory. Why did you dismiss a poor girl? What did she ever do to you? What did she ever do to you? Mr. Kim... Mr. Kim! Let's play the piano. Mr. Kim! It was I who loved you. I pushed Kwak. - I made her write that letter. - You? I can't keep it to myself any longer. I would die happily for a little bit of your love. That's enough. You'd better leave. I can't accept your love. Even if I should die? Why should I take the blame for a crazy girl killing herself? I see. Kwak died silently. But don't expect me to die without a fight. My dead body may be silent, but not my will. My suicide note will say that you raped me one rainy night. I'll plead for your punishment. That will be a proof for the world to know. If that isn't enough, I'll rip my skirt too. Stop! Kyunghee! I'll say it was self-defense. Look down. I could easily kill you now. I could easily kill you now. I can't let your crush on me destroy my family. Kyunghee, come back for your lessons. We'll need the money for the baby. What are you doing here? I was freezing outside in the rain. You. Give me a cigarette. I want to get lucky. Let go! Even you are up to something. Getting stingy with cigarettes now? You think you'll get away tearing Cho's clothes? You two were having quite a time together. I'll tell your wife. You... Now you're here, promise me, Give me piano lessons and hold me like you held Cho. You're out of your mind! I don't want to be second to Cho. Let go! Away With The Murderer! Kwak's death shouldn't be in vain. If writing a letter to the music teacher calls for a suspension. We're better off taking lessons from a record player. Right! Let's hear what Cho has to say. I cried the hardest at the funeral. It was as if I, myself, had died. But you must hear what Mr. Kim said at her grave. What did he say? He said that Kwak may have written the letter out of a whim. But it could have meant trouble for his family. Thanks Cho. I have nothing to say. Let us sing Kwak's favorite song. "Beyond the autumn sky..." "A star shining..." Hands off the piano. - Darling! - You're crazy! - What's wrong with calling you darling? - Don't you ever call me that again! - Don't be so cruel. - Stop it. I'm your mistress now. I deserve to be treated better than a maid. Cut it out. That's enough. Don't be mad. We'll act as if nothing has happened when your wife comes. I'm yours now. I can't get married to anyone else. Don't leave me. I won't even take any wages. I'll stop smoking. Just don't throw me out. Welcome home. Dad. Did you cook for Mr. Kim? Yes, but he couldn't swallow. - A sore throat? - He didn't have an appetite. He must have missed me. The girl who got suspended for writing me a letter is dead. I went to her funeral as a representative of the mill. At that time, my basis of innocence was swept away like a small boat in a terrible storm. She's going to break my piano. - It must be Aesoon. - No, it's not her. Are you insane? You'll cut the strings. Where I used to work before, I saw the landlady take poison after hearing her husband confess an affair. I can't bear the thought of you and your wife sleeping together tonight. - Yoo - Yes? If a married man has an affair... Well, sometimes he can get a lighter sentence than for a traffic violation. Once his wife forgives him, he's acquitted. But just like you don't tell your children that you're a murderer or a robber, there should be some secrets between husband and wife. How can you tell me such a thing as a senior? You're drunk. You're corrupt. Secrets between husband and wife? Damn it! How can it be possible? - Where to? - Just go anywhere. Drive fast! Fly up in the air, or smash into something. Fly up in the air, or smash into something. The meter-man was here yesterday. - How long is it overdue? - When were you over at your mother's? About three months ago. They're going to cut off the lights if you don't pay up today. He came here at least ten times. It is less than a price of shoes. Stomach trouble? If you had a husband, he would be happy thinking that you were pregnant. Bring this to him. Put it down and get out. Don't bother me while I'm busy. I've got something to tell you. Will you please get out of here? I had a nausea and your wife told me that I'd made my husband happy if I had been a married girl. Get me a place where I can bear a child. In seven months, there'll be two lives to keep on living. Dad, the TV is here No TV for you How dare! - Where does it go? - In there We're the richest family in the neighborhood. And we'll be the happiest when you get rid of your sickness. Mom, you'll see me walk Run, squirrel! Run! - Run! - Bastard! - You startled me. - I'm sorry. This is my last month. Soon, you'll become a father of three children. The man next door brought a child from his mistress, and asked his name to be listed in the family register. - What happened? - The wife threw them out. Darling, darling! Are you crazy? In the middle of the night? You child inside me keeps me waking up. What will you do? Are you going to have two babies in the same house? I have a pain in the back. Massage it for me. I have to confess. That's it for today. He's acting strange. Darling. Would you always be there for me? Yes! My body and soul are yours. - Even if I robbed someone? - Yes! - Even Murder? - Yes! Even if I impregnated a girl? You don't mean that. I was in shock after Kwak's death. You got a girl pregnant? - Please, dear. - Don't come near! How could you come to my bed with a filthy body? I feel so dirty. Darling. You promised to be there for me. I'd rather have you dead. Look at me. I'm over the hill. I happily gave myself to this family, because I trusted you. How could you smash my small happiness? You think I'm always after material things. But, they mean nothing if I lose you. It's not all my fault. Why did you want a new house? This would never have happened if we had stayed in our old house. All you want is money. We never had time for ourselves. So this is my fault? Even if I were to forgive you, the factory won't. She isn't from the factory Then who is she? This is so humiliating... So, it's her? When did this happen? Just before you came back from your parents' house. I think there's a way out. I'll beg the girl on my knees. I've heard that you're pregnant. I'll leave if that's what you want. I'll go back to the dorm. They'll take pity on me, once they know whom the father is. Because they will think it's unfair. Listen to me. As women, we should have a heart to heart talk. If you had a husband, he could have done everything for you. But, you're not married. That's why I feel sorry for you. I'll help you in any way I can. You're like a little sister to me. I'll do as you say. I don't want to cause any trouble for you. Then, do as I say. She was easy to deal with. What happened? Everything will be taken care of soon. Thanks. We can't let our precious lives be destroyed now. Take her upstairs. I'll get the doctor. Darling! Don't just stand there. Don't go. Your child is dead. I did as your wife told me. I'll die too. I'll die! You can't leave! What happened? She had an abortion. Your baby is dead. Water. Give me water! Water! Help me. Help. They only care about saving their own skins. Oh, mother! Give me water! Water! Water! Darling! Darling! Darling! Help me, please! Help me! - Help! - Darling! Get the doctor! - Help me! - Darling! Doctor! - Help me! - Darling! Doctor! Darling! Darling! How are you feeling? It's been 10 days now. I'm still bleeding. Blood! Blood! Eat! I won't cook for a concubine even if today is the last day of my life. That was mean. I take that back. I have just gone into labor. I must be having my baby today. - Mother? - She had a boy. It's a boy. - Thank you very much. - Here you are. You're the father, right? - I can tell. - I look like him? No. He looks like you. Go upstairs. It's a boy, right? You're not asking how I am. Sorry, I'm just overjoyed. Things are turning out well. Thanks to you. We still need to take care of one thing. That girl has to go. This is mom breastfeeding the baby. Your breast is bigger than the baby! - You're lying. - Dummy! Why don't you get sick somewhere else. She has no home. Is she a beggar? Anybody who works is no beggar. Then what is she? Dad says we shouldn't talk to a mad woman. Hey you! Go get me some water. I'm thirsty. Do you want to starve me? Really? No food for her? I was afraid to go near her. Let me get you something. People shouldn't starve. Don't bother. I'll get it myself. I'm dying anyway. I'm still bleeding. I'm being punished for murdering my child. But you'll be punished too. You love your child, don't you? Babies are born trusting their parents. I would have loved my baby too. No use now. You don't care that my baby's dead. - You're crazy! - No, just a fool. Why did you kill my baby? Your husband got me pregnant. And you forced me to have an abortion. Isn't it okay if you treat my body like a toy? But, my baby should have been treated the same as your own baby. Let go! Put it down there. I'll take the cup. Don't drink that. This water is poisoned. Rat poison? You're going to die. - Go tell your father. - Changsoon! Father! Changsoon! The maid gave him poisoned water. It was plain tap water. Why did you lie then? I learned how from your mother and father. You killed Changsoon. You killed my son. - All the kids are equal. - You killed him. My baby is yours, too. My baby's dead. Yours should die, too. You're such an awful woman. I'm going to drag you to the police. Even if I ruin my life, I would make you condemned to death. Come on! Let's go. Come on! Let's go. To the police! Darling. The dead child will not come back. It's better to save those who are still living. If the factory learns about this, you'll lose your job. Then, we can't afford to make a living. A touching scenery. But I feel like telling this story in public. I'll do whatever you want. If you want money, I'll give it to you. If you want clothes, I'll give them to you. I want the father of my child. Do as you wish! Darling. At night, come to my room to sleep. Don't stare at me. Wasn't Changsoon enough? Are you going to kill me this time? This is the last time. I've decided to put an end to myself. I left a note for Kyunghee. - Where is it? - In my room. What would I do? You don't even let me die. Do you miss your dead son? I can bear another one for you. Let me go. The funeral is not even over yet. Why are you staying up so late? I'll get this leg fixed and revenge for Changsoon. - Do you want some water? - I won't drink anything you give me. I'm too scared to sleep alone. - What do you want from me? - You promised to sleep with me. How can I sleep by the side of a murderer? I can't lie in bed alone upstairs. I'd rather tell the police and sleep in jail. Darling. Go up to her room. Bring my breakfast upstairs. I'll take in sewing again when I get my strength back. I'll make a move with my children after getting money. Where are you going, dad? Your dad's going to sleep with me from tonight. Dad! Please do not drink any water. Mom! My squirrel has died. She must have poisoned it. Tell you dad I'll bring him his meal. - Shout at him from here. - Okay. Dad, breakfast is ready! Is there something for me too? Don't worry. I brought soup for both of you. There is sugar in my soup. Only in my soup. Want to exchange? No - Mine has poison in it. - What are you talking about? You're trying to poison me. You are an attempted murderer. You know what will happen if I tell the police. Darling. What's going on? I poured out the poison and put sugar in the poison bottle. I knew she'd try to kill me. This is the rat poison. Is this true? Forgive me. I've lost my home, my happiness, my whole life. I only wanted to save my family from this living hell. Darling. Stop whimpering. I have no family to save. Get out! Get out! Mom! - Eat. - I'm not eating anything you serve. You haven't had anything for two days. I'd rather die than eat poisoned food. Eat this to show your mother that it's alright. She has to eat too. Eat. Eat. What brings you here? I suddenly felt like playing the piano again. It has become a source of pain. You've changed. I brought your cigarettes. No more piano for you. You didn't come for your lessons. - You screwed everything. - Are you crazy? Put down that knife! Throw her out. Tell her this house is mine. - Mr. Kim! - Don't call his name. I might stab you. Miss Cho! You'd better go. It's not safe here. Mr. Kim! Give me the knife. I told you not to call him. Darling! Tell her you're mine. Darling! - Let go! - Darling! Kyunghee! Darling! Come up. Come up. You shouldn't be there. It's all over now. The police will be here tomorrow. Two of your children died here. Their ghosts will haunt us. But don't worry. Only your wife and I will be hanged for it. My wife is innocent. Who told me to get rid of my baby? And who tried to kill me? Keep her out of this. Too late. You've ruined me, so I'll ruin you. What? I'll gladly die if that's what you want. But you'll have to die with me. That'll make the living happy. If you refuse, I'll kill your wife and kill myself. Die with me. Make me the happiest woman. - Aren't you scared? - With you, no. - You won't get angry if I call you darling? - Let's drink together. You first. I feel sorry for you. Don't worry. I'll be with you for eternity. I'll ask god to perform our wedding ceremony. The flowers will never wither, while the paths will glitter with jewels. And nobody will ever take you away from me. You don't like me smoking? I've done everything you told me to. Now I want to die at my wife's side. No. I gave up my life for this last moment of happiness. But you said your happiness will be in heaven. It's all over once you die. Happiness is only for the living. You can take my body, but not my soul. No, don't go. If I lose you now, - I'll never find you again in heaven. - Let's go! No. Darling! Darling! Darling! Darling! Darling! Darling! I'm dying. There is no choice but do so. I've always loved you, except for that one moment of betrayal. It ruined everything. Darling! What will you do after I'm gone? Take good care of the children, though I have no right to say. Oh, if only I hadn't wanted the new house. I don't see how a man of good character could lose his head over a maid. That's man's weakness. A high mountain challenges him to climb it. A deep lake prompts him to throw a rock into it. A beautiful girl stirs his most primitive desires. Indeed! Men are beasts. Is the room ready? Never mind. I'll do it. Having a young girl around the house was like offering a piece of raw meat to a tiger. How correctly you put it. Ladies and gentlemen, As men get older, they spend more time thinking about young women. That's how they get drawn into women, which could lead to their destruction. This is true for all men.
