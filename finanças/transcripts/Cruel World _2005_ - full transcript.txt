There's this whole reality TV craze thing sweeping across the nation. l know there's money to be made. l wanna be on a reality show because it's not real! lt's all make-believe. All these TV shows are bullshit. All l need is a little money, if you know what l mean. Not quite a million, but 500,000 would give me some justice. The reason l wanna be on the show is because l wanna be a a star. l would jump at the opportunity to participate in a contest with a few... overall mediocre college kids... especially for a million dollars. What would l do for a million dollars? l think l'd do just about anything for a million dollars.

Because if it is, you can just tell the network that l'm not cool with it. [playing piano] Yeah. Actually, after they finish filming this next show, we're gonna completely renovate the place, and, uh, we're gonna remove all the cameras...and stuff. l don't even watch reality shows anymore.

They're trying to freak us out. This is bullshit. l don't know if l want to keep going. Come on, let's just stay in it for two days and see how it goes. lt's a million dollars, Ruby. You know what? l just need a minute to think, all right? [sighs] l'll come in in a little bit. - You sure? - Yeah. Okay, fine. [all talking] [Philip] When was the last time any of you saw Ruby? Yeah, l left her by the pool. Well, she said she wanted to think for a minute. l'll go get her. This is crazy. Ruby? Rube? Okay. So no sign of her, but l found her necklace in the pool. [Philip] Gina? Ruby quit. What? Gina, Ruby has been sent home. And, uh, l have some bad news for you, too. lt looks like you're being sent home, too. You're sending me home? Looks like all your friends decided to vote you off. Why? You were the last one to see Ruby. lf she was trippin' out, you should have been supportiνe. Are you serious? You're gonna blame me for that? Okay, Gina, did Ruby at any time indicate that she was distressed or upset? No, she just said she wanted to sit by the pool for a minute. Well, then did you ask her if she needed or wanted some company? No, l did not ask her if she wanted or needed company. Since when does not asking someone if they want company wrong? So you're saying that you didn't ask her. So basically you abandoned her in her time of need? Jack, stop with this lawyer shit, okay? You know what? Enough! l'm sorry, okay? Gina, we're all really sorry. l can't believe you guys. l mean, doesn't any one of you find it really strange that Ruby left her necklace in the pool? Wouldn't she at least look for it before she left? [Philip] We can't stop the show for Ruby's necklace. We will make sure she gets her necklace. Fine. Oh. You know what? Voting me out... is actually a really good strategic move. Because everybody here knows that l'm the frontrunner, and that is a conspiracy. lt's not a conspiracy. He made us vote for someone, and we νoted for you. [speaking Spanish] [Philip] Enough with this, Gina! You're being sent home! [Gina speaking Spanish] You guys, l will see you in the morning.

Oh, Mr. Hee-Haw over there likes his meat cooked. l like it worked. What is this shit? lt's probably cow's stomach lining. Hey, Colin, when you get angry, do you beat your meat? That was cheesy. - Ha ha ha! - Stupid! [drops fork] You okay? [coughs] Did she throw up? Are you okay? [coughs] [Philip] You win some, you lose some, Mikko. Pack your bags. Bye, Mary-Kate.

Did l miss something? - Yeah, you are missing something. - What? All right. Listen up. Remember that part in Average Joe where they brought out all these hunks? l mean, that really pissed me off. You know what l'm saying? Yeah, l--l totally agree with you. They did need something for the third act, right? l mean, to kind of spice it up. Am l right, Techno? Come on. Yeah, yeah. That makes sense. You're so right! You know, they bring out these fucking goddamn hunks, totally humiliate the fuck out of these poor, pathetic, fat, ugly pieces of shit! That really pisses me off! Yeah, yeah. lt really pissed me off, too! Techno, come on now. What's wrong with you? You're too agreeable. [laughs] l think it's time for you to go. Bye. What do we have here, Grady?

What is your problem? What do you want? l swear, if l find you, l'll crack your skull! Um, Mr. Producer, sir? You know, l--l was just wondering, like, you know, what's your angle here? Because if there really is a dead body somewhere over there, then, you know, l don't think that you can air that on teleνision... can you? Don't be so, like, naive, Jack. This is gonna be the biggest reality show of all time. Especially with the new twist. Please, no more twists, please. - Jack, no! - Shut up, Colin! That's it! This is oνer for you!
