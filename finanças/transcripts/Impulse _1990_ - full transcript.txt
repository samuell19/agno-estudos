Hi. Hi, yourself. Be easier to talk if you got in. I don't get into cars. Maybe we could just go back to my hotel room. So, what are we talking about here? Say... 50 bucks. What for? I just want to fuck you, nothing weird. Pull around and park. I got a room. You got a room? Ah, not until you pay for it. I want to take a little bite. No. Not now. No, damn it! I said no! I need some help! Police! All right! All right, freeze! Up against the car! Give it up! She propositioned me! ¿A donde estan? Aha. That's it. Let's go. Put that away. No clip, man. The cash. Dele el polvo, julio. Make any test you want. Pay them. No clip, man. Maricones. ¿Verdad? Verdad. Kennedy airport for los angeles is now boarding rows 12 to 18 at gate 37a. Passengers holding tickets in those rows, please proceed to gate... the going's easy today, with traffic on the 101 extremely light heading into downtown los angeles. You can expect temperatures in the high 70s at the civic center, 10 degrees warmer in the san fernando valley. Hi, lottie. How's tricks? What are you doing in my house? Ask yourself this-- how do i keep lieutenant morgan happy when he finds out i'm moonlighting on the hooker detail? Get your fucking feet off my coffee table! Your costume's affecting your manners. Give me that. Just a little kid at heart, huh? Get out. Now. Don't be so cold. If you play your cards right, you might get a shot at the title. Jesus christ. I say something funny? Oh! Why don't you just go home, morgan? You know, connie's dying to go undercover. You might enjoy working behind her computer desk for a while. Come on, what's for breakfast? Eggs. Why don't you have a shower first, though? While i call your wife and ask her how you like them cooked. Hello? I picked up your mail. You got a bank notice-- you're overdrawn $242.76. American express wants you to cut up your credit cards. You open the rest. It got too depressing. This would be a hell of a time to find yourself unemployed. So why did you break up with him? When someone else is paying the rent, it's always due. In the last two years, every time we talk, you've just kissed off another guy. No, not just guys-- cops. Three cops--vice, homicide, and bunco. Check your files. Why do you think that is? And take off your sunglasses. Do you resent being made to come here? Nah. I like watching you. I've never known anyone so anal retentive before. Don't bullshit with me, lottie. Look, according to internal affairs, i'm here for you to evaluate one thing-- whether or not my having shot a perp will affect my judgment and performance on the job. If you're trying to make a normal person out of me, someone who thinks it's wrong to lie and deceive... the department will lose its best female undercover cop. You're not off your job. That doesn't worry me. You do. The incident with morgan-- why aren't you reporting it? Come on, doc, flip on your brights. He'll only say i encouraged it. Did you? Morgan? Not likely. Lately... sometimes... working vice... strangers... the way they look at you... you feel all that... power over them. Make them pay. It excites me. I just... i wonder what it would be like... just to do it. Lose... lose control. Fantasies can be normal, lottie. Yeah, well, in my fantasy, the guy's not handsome. He's old and ugly and... wants me to do all these degrading things. The worse it gets, the more excited i get. What sort of things? Well, first he, uh... aw, shit, doc. Sorry. We're out of time. Very funny. Next week. Same station. Morning, natalie. Is he in? Good morning, katz. He's in. Oy, gevalt. Guess who was in new york last night. New york? My uncle elias, my aunt rose, and their dog jack. Your surprise witness, tony peron. He disappeared on us. What do you mean, he disappeared? He's not under arrest, you know, just protective custody. He was doing a dope deal. That's the good news. Where is he now? That's the bad news. There's a chance he's dead. The feds found an exploded van and four i.d.s. one was peron's. The coroner figures there's only enough spare parts for three bodies. What are you saying? Did they identify peron's body? No. Maybe he wants us to think he's dead. Who is it? Stan. Hello, vic. Forget the hellos and the bullshit. I saw it on tv. Peron's dead, and i'm splitting. You're not going anywhere. We had a deal. Peron's not dead. What the fuck is going on here? He's in new york doing a dope deal while i'm hiding out in some jerk-off witness protection program? You're here rather than sitting in san quentin, remember? I'm not walking into that courtroom as the sole witness. You won't have to. There's three weeks before trial. How much did he score? Street says 900,000. You can kiss your trial goodbye. You know how many air miles 900 grand can put between him and you? Oh, yeah, smart mouth? Where's he going to go? You picture peron on some gilligan's island like vesco? No way. He's a homeboy. He'll be back. Listen, jerk-off, just so we understand. You go to trial and you lose, you lose a promotion. Me? I lose my god damn life! Hey, hey, hey, relax. Come on, sit down. Get the word on the street, and i mean fast. Have peron report to me now, because you're both going into court against luna, and if he doesn't show, i'm going to leak to the press that he's scheduled to testify for me. Then he can deal with luna alone. Do that. Wait a minute. What happens to me if it doesn't work? I'll take care of you. Is that like "trust me"? That's exactly what it is. Think it'll work? I've been on this case for 2 years. I can't give up now. I'll try anything. We can't go against luna with only one witness. I need an apb on tony peron as soon as possible. Done. You know this guy? Frank munoff. Dealer. The d.a.'s office wants him? We don't want him. I'm after hector luna. Luna... the big guy himself, huh? We'll finally be able to indict him, but i need a second witness. Luna's daughter maria lives with munoff. If we pull munoff in, we could pressure maria into testifying. Can you bring him in? I got nothing to hold him on. We could try to set him up. Munoff's a hound for pussy. I got just the girl. A woman? This guy's dangerous. So's lottie. Trust me. I want to meet her first. Sure. She's working tonight. Are we ok with this thing? Give me a love tap if you read me. Gotcha. Same go words as usual-- "what sign are you?" He's in apartment 15. I thought you said apartment number 3. What's the difference? I got a thing about numbers. I don't want to go someplace that's not my lucky number. Yeah? Well, how does 15 feel? Yeah, 15 sounds good. You got that? She's in apartment 15. Roger. Looking for edge. Hey, edge. Hey, edge. Shh. How you doing, man? Everything cool? Come on, man. I told you-- she wants three spoons. How do i know she's not a cop? Fuck you, man. How do i know you're not a cop? What is it with this guy? You said he was cool. Why's he asking me this? 'Cause let's just say you are a cop, but you say you're not. Case won't hold up in court. No shit. Wow. I didn't know that. That's good to know, man. Thanks for telling me. So, um... where's the stuff? Give me three. Where's your outfit? My old man kept it to make sure i don't come home empty-handed. Yeah? Why don't you use mine? Hey, thanks, man. So, uh... what sign are you, anyway? You're a scorpio, right? Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! I don't let anybody fix me. I'm good at fixing. Police! Freeze! Don't move! Get down! Hands behind your head! All right! All right! You! Bring that shit out! Hands behind your head! All right, move! All right. All right. Stand up! Shit. Get your fucking hand-- oh, shit! Didn't want to blow your cover. Forefinger. Lottie's getting pretty pissed. Maybe we ought to cut her loose. Fuck her if she can't take a joke. Get your hand down. Did you talk to her? Yeah. She's still tied up with paperwork. Relax, counselor. She'll be finished soon. You're pushing it with me. Let's not get cranky, lottie. We've got company. This is frank munoff. I know. I busted him two years ago. That's the end of that. It's no problem. I've busted others. They've never made me. I don't like taking risks. Do you drive on the freeway? Do you want the guy or not? Stan, three weeks. Who's my passport to munoff? An informant. Name of gates. Cocaine cowboy. You'll be his date. Gates has a direct line to munoff. He can set up a buy next week. What do you say, counselor? Stan, come on. Ok, it's a go. Can i buy you a cup of coffee? Why? You don't have to drink it. There's a few things we need to discuss. Ok. Must be difficult, working for a man like morgan. I think i can handle him. You do, huh? I don't think it, i know it. It's just part of the job. Friction's normal. Is it normal procedure for a male officer to frisk a female? Like tonight? Morgan just likes to harass people. It's just who he is. I don't take it personally. Well, you should. Why? Because it's not right. Jesus christ. Want to know my first impression of you? Yeah. That you are an unhappy, tight-assed reactionary, who'll spend the rest of his life spitting into the wind. Well... i'm happy. Ok, then, a happy tight-assed reactionary who'll spend his life spitting into the wind. Hmm. But do you like me? So, uh, thanks for the coffee. Thanks for drinking it. Nice car you got, lottie. So's yours. Listen, maybe i ought to follow you home. Just to see that you get home safely. It's pretty late. I can take care of myself. I don't doubt that. Good night. How'd you like to have dinner this week? I can't, um... i'm working, um... i've got some plans. Which? Are you working, or do you have plans? What difference does it make? Then i'll know whether to ask again. Ask again. So far, bubkes on peron. I'm going to take off. Looking at a house. I'll see you in the morning. Come on, stanley. Relax a little bit. Cheer up. Why don't you give arlene a call? Arlene? Yeah. She's a nice girl. And she's, uh... fun to be with. But... no, uh, curb appeal. Curb app-- i spend the evening explaining real estate, and that's what you remember? I'm not interested in the market. I got a reality alert for you, my friend. People depreciate. Every year, you get a little more selective and a lot less desirable. Thank you, charley. Good night. Arlene. Nice girl. Good night, charley. Good night. Natalie. Yes? Check with lapd. See what they'll release on a narco officer, lottie mason. Ok. Curb appeal. Can i buy you a drink? A drink? Maybe, uh, something else. What do you got on your mind? I'm not your ordinary kind of guy. We'll have a real good time, believe me. And i pay good. Sorry. I like girls. Fucking dyke. Vice. You're under arrest for solicitation. Come on. Nice and quiet. No one will know. Looking for a party? Maybe. What are you doing here? Oh, i thought i'd just drop by, proposition you. I thought you'd find that funny. Why would i? Well... lottie, it was just a joke. It was a bad joke. I'm sorry. Inside every guy there's a pervert waiting to get out. Is that what marriage did to you? I pulled your file. The whole relationship was just.... so predictable. I hate that. Being predictable. I don't want to buy groceries on certain days of the week or... make my christmas list out in october. So is this the part where you tell me about you? Not much to tell. Let's see, i'm from buffalo, and, uh... my father was a plumber. You have four brothers and two sisters, and you worked your way through law school. I read your file, too. Touche. So what else did it say in my file? It's a little messy in here. The maid hasn't been here for a while. Four months, as a matter of fact. But, uh, i still pay her. What's this? That's, uh... junior olympics. Thanks. You like to read, huh? Yeah. Do you play? Play? Baseball. Yeah. Yeah. Me, too. When i was a kid. First base in the ponytail league. You're kidding? I play first base. Yeah? Yeah. Collect the cards, too. I didn't know there were so many in a pack. 16. No gum? Here, you want some gum? I hate gum. I just get it for the cards. So you want a porsche? No, i can't stand porsches. Oh, really? That was a gift. I'm going to take that off. It's just on there with a little glue. Is that you? Yeah. On the right. Oh, you climb mountains. That's how i got up there. Mount everest, huh? No, it's not mount everest. It's, uh, mount hood. Is that snow? Yeah, lottie, that white stuff there, that's, uh, snow. I've never seen it snow. You've never seen it snow? You're kidding. No. No time. No money. People get stuck. Where are the photos of the women in your life? You read my file. It's all work. Oh, sure. Well, there have been a few. But nobody special. And how do you feel about him? He seems like a nice guy. They all seem nice for a while. Maybe you don't want them to be nice guys. Maybe you're afraid of nice guys. A lot of maybes. Someone you have to open up to, make a commitment to, trust. I trust me. That's it. He's a guy like any other. I wanted to get laid. Big deal! Why are you getting defensive? I'm not being defensive. I'm keyed up, that's all. I'm doing a major bust tonight. What are you doing tonight? Wash out your pantyhose? Arrange your canned goods in alphabetical order? I'm getting pressure from internal affairs to approve you or take you off the job. Come on. Don't do that to me. Here's the cash for the buy, all marked and recorded. Gates, once again, who is she? Carla st. James. Hey, man, what a phony fucking name. Not like that armani knockoff you're wearing. What's luna's daughter's name? Maria. But i'm not supposed to know that yet. Lottie... be careful, huh? Always. Haven't you noticed? Frank, this is carla st. James. Aha. But that's not your real name. It is until i get to know you better. Frank. Maria. Ok, baby. Will do. Excuse me. Static. Move away from the tv, you dumb broad. Why don't you get off her case? I don't like the way things feel. Give me a love tap if you read me. Give me a love tap if you read me. What are you doing out here all by yourself? Trying to decide whether to abandon our venture. I don't like doing business with so many people around. I wouldn't worry about it. Just a couple of close friends, that's all. Your friends... not mine. Have we ever met before? Not in this lifetime. I like that. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Business first, eh? Ok. Let's do it. Ok. Yeah. Don't you think she's been up there long enough? If i don't hear something soon, i'm calling it off. It's a little late. You had to have this guy, right? This is my job. Let me do it. Oh, shit. My car keys. I forgot to leave them with the doorman. They'll get pissed and tow my car. Shut up and take care of it. Sometimes that guy makes me nervous. I know we've met before. Yeah? Yeah. There's gates. What? There's gates. In the lobby. I just saw him. What's he doing there? I'm going in. The whole thing could blow. One wrong move, she's dead. Gates says you have a heavyweight sponsor. That's right. Hello. What the hell are you doing? That's interesting. Just what the hell makes you think that? Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's good to know. Oh, don't worry. I'll take care of you. I knew you were a fucking cop! That's right. A scared cop. We're going in. Police! I'll door-knock the place. Everybody stay alert. Come on, come on, come on. How much do you make a week? $500 or $600? I've got $70,000 in that safe. Hey, frank. We can make a deal. The stairs. Get her! Hurry. Frank? Hey, frank. Police! Police! Lottie? Police! Stay back. Oh, shit! There she goes. Did you see a woman in a purple dress? English! Where is she? Call the cops! Call the cops! Get out of here! Take anything you want. Are you ok? Lottie. Give me a couple more shots. Sorry munoff ate the big bonita, but we got the luna broad by the ass. I found three keys of white-out in the safe, plus 60 grand in cash. He told me 70. I'm surprised he didn't say 100, the way these freaks exaggerate. What kind of firepower were you using tonight? You splattered that guy all over the place. Let's see it. I'm surprised at you, lottie. This is an out-of-policy weapon. I'm alive, aren't i? I'll have to keep this. Go ahead. Lottie. Lottie! Give me some breathing room. Damn! Hey! Hey, can you change my tire? Take a while. The spare's in the trunk, not in the front of my dress. Keys are in it. Shit. Hello. Hello? Hello? * I know it's hard sometimes * * and things seem larger than they are * * but if you need to tell someone... * what'll it be, miss? Tequila shooter, please. Bartender, i'll take care of it. Gentleman's paying. Hi. Meeting someone? Nope. Flat tire. My car's being fixed across the road. You look like you've been to a party. I was, but it was a bust. Nah, i never liked parties. Watching a bunch of phonies stand around telling me who they think they are. So what do you do? Whatever i feel like doing. That isn't exactly what i meant. I'm a businessman. Aerospace industry. What about you? What do you feel like doing? Right now? Right this minute? I feel like getting on a plane and going someplace... i've never been before. Like where? For instance? Paris. Well, let's go. No, i mean it. Come on, come on, let's go. I can't. I'm a working girl. I mean-- suppose... i gave you the plane fare... and you go someplace else you've never been? My house. I'd enjoy the ride a lot more if i was traveling first class. We'll negotiate the round trip afterwards. I never did get your name. Carla. Why don't we go upstairs so i can fix us a drink? Ok. I think i'd like to go freshen up for a minute. Yeah. To the left of the stairwell. What am i doing? I'm getting out. Operator 322. I'd like to report a murder. 1722 beverly estate drive. We have you registered on the screen and will dispatch immediately. Are you alone in the house? May i have your attention, please? All passengers departing flight 123 to chicago will now be boarding at gate 14. Flight 35 now boarding at gate 37a. Passengers, please proceed to gate 37a. Found two sets of i.d.-- one says jimmy denton, the other says tony peron. I vote peron. He died by two contact gunshots to the head. Definitely small caliber. Probably .22. There's almost no rigor, so time of death must be about 12:30 a.m. an anonymous woman caller reported it. If a broad did it, she sure knew how to use a gun. Did you find the money? What money? A drug killing in new york. Peron made off with a million bucks. Place is clean. No money, no drugs. Nothing. Why wasn't that in the file you gave me? It had nothing to do with anything... until now. I feel like a god damn mushroom, kept in the dark and fed bullshit. You came to us for help. We bend over backwards. You hold out on pertinent information. I'm fucking sick of it! This investigation is under my jurisdiction, not yours. You'll know what i decide you should know, no more and no less. You know what i'm sick of? I'm sick of your god damn mouth. Come here, charley. So we got no money, and we got no drugs. We got nothing, charley. Not a thing. Shit! I guess that's it, huh? Munoff's dead, now peron. We pack our attaches and go home. What about this woman who reported it? She made a call. That's all we know. Yeah, but what's the connection, charley? I mean, uh, is she working for luna? If she's luna's friend, why would she call? I don't know. Not good for prints. Just a few smudges. Looks like things have been wiped. Got a couple of long red hairs, about 29 centimeters. Found them in the bathroom. Maybe synthetic. No root structure. I'll have it definite after i check it out. Yeah. Find the owner of the house and what the connection with peron is. Don't let the media know about the caller. Police have identified the victim in that beverly hills murder last night as anthony peron, a west coast crime figure. Police say they have no suspects, but we're hoping for more details later on in the day. Stan, we had a deal. I kept my end, didn't i? I did everything you told me. I cooperated right down the line, but luna found peron first. Face it, it's over. It is not over. What do you mean? We have an eyewitness. Witness? Where is he? Not he, she. I'm trying to find her now. When i do, i'll use it. An anonymous caller, right? But it's a woman, which is half of los angeles, maybe a little more. Don't bullshit me, stan. You're trying to buy time. You got no witnesses. Believe me, i'll find her. When i go into that courtroom next week, you'll be with me. 1722 beverly estate drive. I'd like to report a murder. 1722 beverly... lottie. I thought i'd come see if you wanted to have lunch. I'm really sorry i didn't call yesterday. I was... don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Paperwork took longer than i thought, and then i fell asleep. Come in. Have a seat. I've been a little crazy myself. You heard about peron? Yeah. On the news this morning. Whose voice is that? Oh, that's an anonymous, uh, caller who reported it. Any leads? No, uh, not yet. Lottie, i'd love to have lunch with you, but i'm up to here-- don't worry. I thought i'd see if you were free. Can i see you tonight? Um, i'll call you this afternoon. Promise? Yeah, i promise. I'll see you later. Ok. Peron leased the house a week ago from beverly realty-- 10,000 a month. Told you at least 10. The leasing agent met peron at the scaramouche. I talked to the bartender. He identified peron. Says he'd been there lately. He was there last night. Left about midnight with a girl-- auburn hair, 5'6", fancy dresser. Has she been there before? He never saw her before. He thought peron called her carrie or karen. Also, she said she was getting her car fixed at a gas station nearby. You checked it out? Dead end. All he remembers is that she had a great set of tits. Breasts. This guy doesn't remember what kind of car he repaired? First he says chevy, then camaro, then switches to cougar. He did think it was blue. Get a composite artist over here right away. Get those two witnesses in here. We don't have all year. Talk to anybody the bartender remembers from last night. And morgan, i assume you have someone posted outside the bar, just in case she returns? I do know my job, counselor. Assistant d.a. thinks he's god. Goes to court, runs off at the mouth, and gets paid. Thinks i'll jump whenever he opens his fat mouth! We put our asses on the line every day, and nobody gives two shits. What else is new? I've had it up to here. Yeah. That's pretty close. Thank you. Thanks for coming in. Anything else i can do? If she comes in again-- count on me. Thanks. Makes sure this goes out statewide to all police departments as soon as possible. And send it to the media with a hotline number. I got a composite to get on the wire. Yeah. Right now. And send me gloria from press relations, ok? I know it's late to cancel this evening, but i'm still not feeling that great. I'd like to see you, but i wouldn't be very good company. Forgive me. Call me tomorrow, ok? Sleep tight. Lieutenant, next friday, 10 a.m., judge riordon's chambers. Gates wants to plea bargain. Prosecutor wants us there-- you, me, and carla. Carla? Carla st. James. Tell lottie, will you? Carla. Yeah. I'll tell her. They want to see you in the gates-munoff hearing. Fine. Luke says you want to go after this burrows kid. Yeah. I haven't had time to do any research yet. I'm not going in there fat, dumb, and stupid. I've seen you do some pretty stupid things before, lottie. I don't have time for this nickel and dime shit. I'm on this task force with your friend, trying to find peron's killer and a lot of missing dollars. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Why would i? It's not my case. Never mind. I just got a good lead. That's why you get the big bucks, morgan. Anything wrong? You can talk to me. I'll keep that in mind. Pull the plug on this burrows bust. Get somebody else if you want him. Hi. Hi. I lied. You lied. Why? I didn't want us to become a habit. What are you putting on there? It's curry. Ah, of course. Very good. It's a habit of mine. Not all habits are bad, lottie. Can i have a beer? Mm-hmm. In the fridge. This place is a mess. Reminds me of home, living with my two brothers. Now i'm a mess. Taste this. Ok. Pretty good, huh? Uh... no. There. You see? It would never work. We're too different. Oh, lottie... what do you want out of life? What? On mondays, i always want a fat bank account. Tuesdays, i'm worrying whether i should invest it or spend it on a car... jewelry, furs... i always spend it. By wednesday, i'm feeling pretty guilty. I think i should be doing something useful, like be a schoolteacher or nurse. Oh, what do i want? I guess... i want something to last. What would you say if i... if i said i thought i was falling in love with you? What would you say? What would you say, lottie? You wouldn't say anything, would you? You're strange. You're a strange woman, lottie. Maybe that's why i can't stop thinking about you. Ohh... oh, shit. Good morning. Have some coffee. I will. Uh... i got to go. Stan, don't go. There's something i need to talk about. I got a meeting. It's important. I need-- i got to go, lottie! What is it, lottie? It's nothing we can't talk about later on. This peron case-- it's driving me crazy. I'm sorry. No luck, huh? Well, we have a lead... on a woman. Reliable? We just have her first name. Oh. What is it? Well, we've, uh, decided not to tell anybody. Didn't realize i was just anybody. Lottie, you're not just anybody. I'm a cop. A good cop knows where she stands on the chessboard. Don't worry about it. Better go, or you're going to be late. I'll see you later. Yep. Beverly estate drive. I'd like to report a murder. 1722 beverly estate drive. I'd like to report a murder. 1722 beverly estate drive. I'd like to report a murder. Carla. That was her name, man. How could i forget? This girl was a fox. Yeah. Did they come in together? She came in here to work the place. It didn't take her long. What do you mean "work" it? She slid in, ordered tequila. Next thing i know, this guy's pulling out these bills. You saw him offer her money? He pulls out this big wad of hundreds. Lays it right there on the bar. Then she left with him? Yeah. She left with him. Stan, are you all right? Just great. Come in the house. Who are you? What? Which one of these characters that you play is you? You're drunk. What is this? You tell me... carla. I don't know what you mean. Why not tell me another lie before i take you downtown... and have you booked for murder? How long have you and peron been buddies? How long have you known him? Known him? Yeah. I didn't know him. I only met him that night. I didn't even recog-- tell me what happened that night. Huh? What happened? It was after the munoff bust. I was really hyped. On the way home, i got a flat tire. While it was being fixed, i went across the street to the bar. Who was there? Peron? He bought me a drink. I thought-- didn't he buy something else? Did he put money on the bar and buy something else? Didn't he buy you? You took the money because all you were worried about was a fat bankroll, right? Then you went with him. And you fucked him. You fucked him for money! I... didn't you fuck him? I don't know why i went with him. I know i didn't fuck him! You didn't? What stopped you? Maybe you looked at him and saw my face? No! Is that what you want to hear? I stopped because i don't know what i was doing there in the first place! You got to believe me. I... i... i went up to his house... and i told him to fix us a drink. I was really scared, and i needed to figure out a way to get out of there without a hassle. So when i was in the bathroom, i heard two gunshots. So i hid. Morgan--he took my gun. Remember? I may be a lot of things, but i'm not a murderer. I'm a cop. I know how things work! I didn't have to report it! Then why did you report it, lottie? I--i wanted to do the right thing. Right? Aah! Aah! You know what you did? You watched me sweat my balls off looking for that son of a bitch! Trying to figure out this fucking puzzle! Looking for the mystery lady. You wanted to put things right? You fucking did! I have something to show you. I wanted to tell you! I tried to tell you! I wanted to trust you, stan. You wanted to trust me, lottie? Please let me finish. Don't go now. If you go now, it'll never be the same. Oh! So that's it. You've told me everything? Yeah. I used to think i was such a good judge of character. I really messed up. We both messed up. Is it possible someone followed you to peron's house that night? No. I was too keyed up that night. I would have noticed. Who knows you as carla? Morgan. He hates me, but why would he-- you know him better than i do. Maybe that's how he gets his kicks. Maybe he thinks we have the money. I don't know. I do know a killer's out there somewhere. Once your face is on the news, he'll know there's an eyewitness. However you look at it, you're in one hell of a jam. So, uh... what happens now? You going to turn me in? It's dangerous, and i don't like it. Harold, we, uh... we have no choice. We're at a dead end. The officer's volunteering to pose as this witness? Yes. We'll stage an appearance here tomorrow, get a lot of advance press. I'll get it on the news tonight. And you think the killer will follow her? It's our only shot. All right. There's been a new development in the murder of anthony peron. The mayor's office released a composite drawing of an anonymous woman last seen with him and thought to have telephoned police from the crime scene. Police ask that anyone having seen this woman call news tip at 555-3244. 555-3244. So you're saying she saw the killer? Yes. She can make a positive identification. We expect an arrest very soon. Tough assignment, being a sitting duck, huh, lottie? How did lover boy talk you into this one? Sorry. I forgot what a dedicated cop you are. Try not to shoot to kill this time, ok? What do you mean? I'll tell you what i mean. If the killer dies, we'll never know what happened. That would be a shame, what with a million bucks lost out there. Oh, counselor... i'll leave her in your capable hands. Couldn't you have kept him out of this? I want to keep an eye on him. There's plenty of security. Don't worry. I never rely on anybody but myself. Everything else aside, that's why i knew you weren't the killer. He used a .22, not a bazooka. I'll be close by. Stan? I know this sounds really crazy, but, um... right now i'm more scared about us than anything. W-10 here. All "w" units and all units on the perimeter, stay awake. 6w-22, ok here. W-21, no action so far. Where you going? Take a leak. * Her eyes shone like the diamonds * w-21 to all units. We have a slow-moving vehicle. This might be our boy. Police! Police! Freeze! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! I didn't do nothing! Get your hands off. I'm clean! You guys scared the shit out of me! Some guy offered me 50 bucks to deliver flowers. I figured what the hell. Behind you! Lottie! Vic. No one will ever get luna. I had to shoot peron to get off the hook. Take good care, lottie. I will. I can't believe you're leaving. It won't be the same without you. I'd like to say i'm going to miss the place, but i'm not. You're retiring? You might say that. You must've inherited some money. Last i heard, you were overdrawn. Who died? Blow it out your ear, asshole. Hi. Thanks for coming. I resigned today. I'm a full-fledged civilian. I thought you like living on the edge too much to quit. People change. What are you going to do? I thought i'd get out of town for a while and think about things. Sorry about your case. I heard you had to drop it. It's no big deal. I'll get him. Eventually. I guess i just don't know when to quit. Can you ever forgive me for what i did? Yeah. But you can't forget it. You can't, can you? It's so simple when you're a kid. When you've done something wrong, you say... "i'm sorry." "I take that back." I'd give anything if i could take it back. Lottie? Send me a post card. Yeah, sure. All passengers arriving from detroit on flight 202 have now arrived at gate 15 on concourse "c." Aah! Let go of me! Don't make a scene. I'm a cop and you're not! Get the fuck in here! Such a clever little bitch, aren't you? Police! Get out of here! You thought you'd get away with it. You're under arrest. Give me the briefcase. No! Want me to fucking take it? Take it! What? Where's the money? I don't know. I don't know, my ass! Where's the fucking money? I swear to god, i don't know! Where is it? I'll rip your eyes out, bitch! Give me the god damn money, harris! Bitch! K.o. the broad. She'll fuck you over for that money. There is no money. There never was. I always said you belonged in the toilet. Hey... you all right? Yeah. Just bumped my head a little bit. You have a little blood on your lip. I do? Jeez! Look at you. Not bad for a guy who graduated law school. Yeah. Hey... wait a minute. What is going on here? You set me up back there. I could've been killed. What do you mean there's no money? Where are you going? I'm going to have a drink. What's this for? It's my car keys. It's parked on the upper level in 4e. The money's in the back. What's the catch? There is no catch, lottie. The money's yours free and clear. That's what you wanted, isn't it? Turn it in. I need a drink. I hate being predictable. You know, lottie, not all habits are bad. * Everybody * needs somebody * everybody * you keep your distance * are you afraid * afraid your heart's gonna break * * aren't you tired * of carryin' the load * nothin' is sacred * and nothin' is fair * livin' in a world gettin' harder to bear * * you start denyin' * what you already know * standin' in the shadows alone * * everybody needs someone * to lean on * everybody needs someone * have someone to love * and every time that he holds you * * he makes you realize * that there in the dark * there's nothin' to hide * open your heart * let love in your life * ohh * ohh ohh * oh * ooh * mmm-mmm * sometimes we need * what we deny * but i can see the truth in your eyes * * mmm, everybody * needs somebody * everybody * everybody needs someone * to lean on * everybody needs someone * needs someone to love * everybody needs someone * to lean on * everybody needs * they need * need somebody * need someone to love * to love * ohh * everybody * ooh * needs somebody * to love * everybody needs someone to love * * someone to love
