CODES Written by Starring: Music: Directed by: Excuse me, sir, whom are you looking for? First floor. On the left. Please wait a moment. - Is she very busy? - You may go in, sir. - You should know it's authentic. - Where have you unearthed this wonder? I went to great lengths to acquire it. Just for you, of course. Because I know you're a true art connoisseur. - And the price isn't high. - I know. You always say the same thing. And then he comes up with this junk. Please put it in the hallway. This way, please. - Thank you, madam. Good bye. - Good bye, sir. You look well. - How was your trip? - Excellent. Thank you. I left the luggage at the station. Sit down. Take off your shoes. I'll bring you slippers. What are you doing over there? I'm making you some toast. - Do you like toast? - I think so. What's so funny? For the first time in 25 years, someone simply told me: 'sit down and take off your shoes'. And what have you been doing lately? - What do you mean, 'lately'? - Well, in general. I've been liquidating my assets. I know, because you wrote me about it. But... over the years? I quit my job as an instructor. I reached the age limit. I've got some savings. In a private college near London, they have a position opening in administration. There's a possibility of joining a silent partnership. But this is only next year, in autumn. So, I thought, I'm going to have a year-long vacation. And you remembered you have a relative in Paris. And have you had any news from... ...back there? I have. Zofia wrote twice. Maciek wrote once. And you, of course, haven't written back? I'm not good at writing letters. I've been waiting until I'm in the mood. And have you waited long? Zofia wrote that Jedrek was seen in Italy. She asked me to find him, and once I have, not to reproach him anything. I was supposed to make sure it was really Jedrek. Because it could be someone only pretending to be him. Right. Zofia has always been strange. It was because of her eccentricities that I had been thinking of divorce. It would have happened, if not for the war. She never writes to me, even though she lives in my Cracow apartment, with my furniture, which she is selling, although I can't blame her. In her next letter, she was asking for some sleep medication. I was even touched, and wanted... I wanted to, but then I was in Beirut... and such medication was unavailable. And then you forgot. I did. Then I forgot. Only now can we be certain that Jedrek is dead. Mom! Dad! 'We could have some hope while the war lasted. Now, there is no doubt'. 'Mother still has hopes, but I know he is dead'. That's what Maciek wrote to me. He wrote that perhaps one day he may be able to tell me everything. He wrote to me, too. There's a post scriptum addressed to you. 'Please tell him that mother is very ill. She lives in the past, as if death had never occurred, or as if she herself were no longer alive. I'm alone with her, and there is no way for me to leave her. I also regret my own life. Father should know about it, although I can't imagine he could help'. You should go there. The sun will rise and bring a day more terrible than darkness. And silence will be more terrible than storms in the sea, because you shall fear one another. And the snow will turn into a sea, and its waves will be green. And your house will be a sinking ship. Faster! Faster! I'd like to pay. Just a moment. You've requested your bill? Yes. Dinner, coffee, and brandy. Thank you. - Are you getting off in Cracow? - Yes. - We're arriving in 14 min. - Thank you. Express train from Paris... will stop at platform 1, track 2. Please keep away from the edge of the platform. This is Cracow. We welcome you and wish you a pleasant stay. Are you still waiting? Please proceed to the exit. I booked you a room in a hotel. Maciek! We still live in this large shared room. And how are you? How's your mother? She's ill. Let's go. - And what happened later on? - You mean... - ... when? - Well... ... when you knew I wouldn't come back till the war was over. Nothing. I was attending high school. - Schools were open? - Yes, but no one studied. In October, the professors were deported, and schools were closed shortly afterwards. We weren't allowed to wear school uniforms... We would cut off silver buttons, remove shoulder and trouser stripes... What did you live on? We sold things: first ours, then Aunt's... Winter was harsh. I stood in lines outside coal depots or round train cars at the rail station... My hands got frostbitten. - What about mother? - Mother...? Mother baked cakes. All deserted women baked cakes. For the caf√©s. It was strangely cheerful. You thought it would be over soon? Yes... But that's not why it was cheerful. It was cheerful because everyone lived a life beneath their worth. - What? - One's ambition was not to have any ambition. - No... I don't understand. You see, it soon turned out that you can get rich on idleness and peddling. And in the second year of Occupation, money inspired respect... ... on the condition that it was earned illicitly. Ideal goods were those that didn't exist. I read about all this... So what, that you read... You still don't understand what it means to accept a false life as the only true life. To this day, I live a life beneath my actual worth... You've had enough time to forget about it. That's what you think... Besides, don't argue with me when I'm telling you facts. Tell me only what can be of any use to me. Right... Jedrek was taken towards the end of November by the SS Sicherheitspolizei. I wasn't in Cracow at the time, I came back only in March. We looked for him, we made a radio announcement, we wrote to the Red Cross. Mother held out while there was still hope that Jedrek might come back. Then she had a breakdown, and has lived since in her own world to which no one has access. She takes lots of drugs, then needs to be taken to the hospital; they refuse to keep her, ask that she be taken home... Then I'm left alone with her. To calm her down, I tell her that I've had some news of Jedrek. So she does calm down, and waits. What can be done to make her better? Nothing... At her age, when the patient considers her illness as something like a refuge, nothing can be done. She's very kind. You'll be surprised how little she's aged. Tell me, did Zofia... did your mother really love Marian? Marian was with her... Since when? After his regiment had been defeated, Marian was captured, then escaped, then made his way to Cracow. It was almost curfew when he rang the doorbell; mother let him in... Do you really want me to tell you everything about Marian? Not now. Tell me... what was Jedrek doing in the organization? Nothing. We kept him out of all this. So why was he captured? Tell me what did Jedrek have to do with any of this? He was afraid. Mother told me he couldn't sleep at night. Only listened out for the footsteps of German soldiers. Both of them couldn't sleep: Jedrek and mother. But he wasn't a child anymore... He was afraid in September, when he was little, but later... We all lived in the same room: Jedrek, mother, and I, even the servant's room was occupied. Marian stayed in it until he... left. Two rooms were occupied by Germans from the Arbeitsamt. Don't think they moved in by force. Their names on the door simply protected us against the police. Our apartment was a contact point. We had briefings; on camp beds there slept liaison officers who came to pick up guns and instructions... We all slept on something. - So did Jedrek. - Did he know about it? - He did. - So he was part of the organization! - He wasn't. - That's impossible! Weren't you afraid that Jedrek would be the one to get caught? Anyone could have been caught. You probably want to ask if we were aware of the risk? Right?! Yes and no! Just ask a soldier returning from the front - he'd say the same thing! War is possible only because no one can be certain of the danger! I saw the war with my own eyes, so you don't need to tell me. You just don't know what it's like when you fight it at home! In a rented room, with access to the kitchen, and in presence of women and children. What it's like when war stands in the way of love. You took part in wars with the army. But you've no idea what it's like when war is part of everyday life. I don't understand everything you say. Be quiet and listen. Jedrek was not part of the organization, - because he didn't want to be! - He was scared. Then he demanded to get involved, but you refused because you considered him a coward. So? He demanded that we stop all activity. How could a child demand that a military organization cease to exist? - He threatened. - With what? He must have suffered a nervous breakdown, and should have been sent away somewhere... To the countryside... And mother? When he started his hysterics, she said we shouldn't take the risk. Did you dissolve your contact point? Yes. In the spring of 1944. How do you know that Jedrek was killed? Because we never heard from him... or seen him again. But he was seen in Italy. Mother saw him there... through her bedroom window... Afterwards... they told him to get dressed... I wanted to help him but... the soldier who was guarding him... wouldn't let me. And then he leaned over me... and whispered: 'It's nothing...' Or maybe it was: 'There's no need...' Or maybe yet something completely different... Jedrek wasn't guilty. They took him quietly, without pushing or shouting... Quietly... And afterwards no one ever came: either from the police or from the organization... Jedrek was innocent. We should have helped him... But I'm always tired... I was left alone. I didn't go see anyone... I was scared. I was even afraid that I might harm someone... I waited for a sign, for some news. I thought the whole time -- what did the man who was guarding me say? -- he told me I mustn't be afraid. That I shouldn't be afraid But you said that he said: 'Nothing'. Ah, yes... Nothing. What was he like? He was...little. What did he like to do? Play war. You used to tell him about the other war, as if it were the most beautiful time in your life. And then they prepared him for the new war which was supposed to become his real life. He was scared. Since you left, he was anxious... about you, about Maciek, about me... He wanted us to be together. He always wanted all of us to be together. Throughout the war, he kept asking when we would go back home. And where were you then? First in the forest, then at the Gorcza estate near Slomniki. And Marian wasn't there? - No. - He was already dead? He had been dead for a few days. He was shot in the street as he was trying to escape from a patrol. Mother told you that? No. I tell you what I know. He was scared when he saw people running, when there was a crowd in front of bulletin boards with announcements of executions. He was afraid of sirens. When they signaled curfew at night, he would call me to the window to watch. He would lock himself in a dark room, and roar like a siren. He took care to maintain the deep tone, towards the end, when a siren unwinds. All boys like to play war. When the air raids started, he wouldn't eat or sleep. Frequent arrests... He was afraid of door bells, footsteps in the stairwell... He would disappear for hours and come back distracted, and escape again... into his drawings. Sometimes he would tell us what he saw: he was amazed by the fact that man can endure in a strange ritual position, overcoming fatigue; he wondered at the way man deforms his body by means of his uniforms, chasubles, ephods... He would spend days on end among religious fanatics, staring at the altar with this weird smile of his that never left his face. When he watched, devoted to his gawking... he did everything differently, not like other boys -- for fun or out of curiosity -- but as if he did it to torment himself, to destroy himself. He went to church because he preferred observing what was happening at the altar. He became an altar boy. He stood guard with his candle or his censer... Except that he would give up... Distracted... Horrible, incontrollable, obsessive but nothing more than day dreaming... which could not be helped... Look You see... What is this? Samples of fabrics. He attended business college. What for? Why didn't he take clandestine classes? He didn't want to. He couldn't study literature history... You see how he kept his notebooks... Gross? Yes. You don't remember? He was in Maciek's class in junior high. His parents went abroad on vacation before the war, just like us. And never came back. Zygmunt Gross, that's his notebook. He befriended Jedrek during the war and... He got his degree in medicine. He has a practice here in Cracow. He's my doctor. - Dr. Gross. - Come in. You came to see me? Dr Gross? Yes, it's me. I'm an old friend of your father's. Yes, of course, I remember. I remember. It's a pleasure. Please, come in. I came from abroad. I'd like to talk to you. You were friends with my son... - May I...? - Please, go ahead. Thank you. Your Polish is excellent. Not even an accent. Thank you, doctor. Some spent less time abroad and have an accent. - Will you have a drink? - Yes, please. Unfortunately, Russian. Yes, I used to be friends with Jedrek. There was a significant age difference between us. Here you go. - Jedrek was strange. - How do you mean? He was very... how to put it.... distant... If I'm not mistaken, the English call it Yes, boys do go through phases like this. Except that in Jedrek's case this lasted much longer and had some meaning... Religious, perhaps... When someone hit him... When he was attacked... he wouldn't defend himself. Once he crossed a school bully who beat him to a pulp. He trusted me... or he chose me as a spectator in the theatre in which he was the actor. Boys tend to tell stories about their successes and victories. He--quite the contrary. He would boast of his humiliations: that he wouldn't return a blow, like I said, or that he let stronger boys beat him to a pulp. You're taking care of my wife, doctor? Yes, Zofia's my patient. I need some explanations. What can I tell you... Her illness is psychological: a sense of guilt... A sense of guilt which is both the symptom and the cause of her illness. Guilt about the dead child? This would have been a classic case. Here, however, there's something else. This case is all the more peculiar that that which usually produces illness, has, in some sense, become reality. I don't quite follow. Events unfolded following the logic of pathological associations, that is to say, reality had become mad. There's no reason to hide anything from you: you're at an age when such matters are no longer taken personally. You mean to talk about the man with whom my wife had a relationship during the war? I know that you are very well informed. But I'm not sure whether you are aware of the connection between this man and Jedrek. Between his cause and everything that happened afterwards. Please, continue. - Marian... - You knew him? Yes. We worked together in the organization. If those days mean anything to me, it's only thanks to Marian. You knew him, as well. I'd known him certainly longer than you. But at a different time, hence as a different person. He was Zofia's cousin, and was in love with her since they were children. He was a good-natured fool, a cadet. He made Zofia laugh with his buffoonery, and he didn't bother me. War allowed him to become the man you knew. And to win Zofia over. Zofia sheltered Marian when he escaped from the POW camp. I know this, and I don't blame either him or Zofia. As you said, I'm at an age when... And so on. - There is only one thing I wish to know. - Which is? How did my son die? And why did he die? He was arrested. And no one ever saw him again. Listen... Zofia described the circumstances of Jedrek's arrest as best as she remembered them. She undoubtedly told you that the man who was guarding her leaned over her and said something like 'Nothing' or 'Nichts'. Then she said that the house wasn't guarded, etc. I was telling you about Marian. This man knew everything about us. Everything: he knew our addresses, pseudonyms, real names; he contacted the headquarters; he knew the plan of operations, but it wasn't just that. Thanks to him, what we were doing, became worthwhile, acquired some charm... Perhaps we needed heroes and created him ourselves, in the image of our desires... I don't know... This proves only one thing: He was indispensable. Why are you telling me about Marian? To convince you that he had to survive. Does this mean that Jedrek was taken as a hostage to get Marian? Yes. Does this mean that Zofia could have saved Jedrek, if she gave away Marian's hiding place? Yes. It seems to me as if all this took place in another world. I'm sorry I came to see you. But you seem to know my wife better than I do now. Because she changed in ways I cannot understand. Zofia is ill, and needs help. Thank you. You lied to me, doctor. - I don't understand. - There was no need for a hostage. Marian had died two days earlier. Before Jedrek was arrested. I found someone who told me about this. Mr. Czeslaw? Are you the owner? The manager... the working people are the owner... Please take it to Mr. Antoni. He'll write you a receipt. What can I do for you? I'd like to talk to you. If that's necessary, go ahead. How did you find me? My son works here. Occasionally. Have a seat. You also worked together during the Occupation. From time to time. Sir... You're familiar with the matter I came here to investigate. Please spare me your questions. I was an officer in the underground army. I trained officers and reserve officers. After Marian died, I took command of the regiment. Within 3 months, the regiment ceased to exist. The Occupation came to an end. The war had taken my best years, and that's why I'm running a used bookstore instead, for instance, doing academic research... There you go. That's all. My war is over. And you want to continue yours because you're suffering from some sort guilt complex, for not having participated... I played my role in this war... I didn't mean to offend you. I'm trying to unravel this knot in which my wife and my two sons are entangled. The one who is no longer here and the one who is lost here, and can't find his place... I want to do everything that can still be done. Do you also believe that this boy is still alive? There is no reason to believe that. But I could not leave my wife's plea to search for him unanswered. Her entire hope lies in the words she didn't hear clearly. Words whose meaning she grasped only later, during those months when she lived in isolation. A whisper which might have been a creation of her weary mind; maybe one of the torments that brought about her nervous breakdown... Please accept the reality. That's why I came here. But that is why I must know everything. What is there that you don't know? I don't know why Jedrek was taken. And why were six million defenseless people murdered? Do you know that? I'm old. You know how far me and my wife have grown apart. I have no common language with Maciek; the war separated us for ever. I'm searching. I'm searching for this child killed 20 years ago because I feel he is the closest thing I have... How can I help you? Please tell me the whole truth. I told you everything I know about this. I'm sorry I took up so much of your time. - Good bye. - Good bye. Who was that bookstore manager? If you found him, and talked to him, you must know everything. He was your commanding officer? He was Marian's deputy. And the doctor, who was he? Are you double-checking the information? He was a platoon commander. How many platoons were there? You want to know all the commanders? You were one? For a time. Until you joined the guerillas, right? - Yes. - Did you join them at your own request? - Yes. - Why? - That's what I wanted! - Tell me... Why did Marian leave Zofia? - He left. They left. - Who? Marian and Jadwiga. The one who ran first-aid training? Not only. So tell me... What else can I tell you? You know everything! Do you remember anyone from the district? Anyone from the headquarters? Anyone with whom Marian was in touch? I remember only one person. His pseudonym was 'Raven'. That's all I know. Have you tried to find him? How? You said you remembered him... You see these two men? This is what meetings with the commanding officers were like: such briefings on the run. If someone should ask you, say, a few years from now, if you know this man, will you be able to recall him? The one walking towards us? No, that was Marian. 'Raven' was the other one. I saw him in town only once... and from such distance. Then I met him in Gorcza. But that was at night. I'm going to give you a piece of good advice: don't look for anyone to blame. If they're guilty--it's according to the law that didn't exist back then. What law? According to the law of preserving every life at any cost. That was our war! Now I don't understand. Listen... Once I wrote you that I would explain everything... Then do. - I saw him. - Jedrek? - Yes. It was in Gorcza. - When? Shortly after he'd been captured. I didn't know he'd been captured. And I knew nothing of Marian's death. They came in a horse cart. From the station. I was waiting for them because - they had told me the day before they were coming. - Who? They didn't say who. I was to show them the way to the forest. Give them the password. Besides the driver, there were two other men. And Jedrek who was asleep. I saw his head. He was covered with a blanket. So this means they rescued him. You're unable to understand what I'm telling you. Can't you... understand...? This doesn't mean they rescued him! This means... It was they who captured him. You understand, you wretch? It was our men. Our men... Darkness will be my companion and my country. And my eyes like servant girls who have ceased working because the lamp ran out of oil. My sight, like doves flying in the night, that crash against rocks. Rings of fire will form in my brain and stand before my eyes like faithful servants carrying lanterns before the Lord. And they will stretch their arms in darkness to raise one of the fiery stains... And they erected three crosses, made of the tallest tree in the land. And three martyrs stepped forward, one from each group. Guided not by fate, but by their own free will. They weren't the leaders, but among the least important. And these madmen were hung upon the crosses. And their hands were nailed to the beams. The one on the right cried: 'Equality!'. The one on the left cried: 'Blood!'. The one in the middle repeated: 'Faith'. - Is this where you waited for them? - Yes. I stayed with this rail man when I had to leave the estate. Why won't you say hello? I don't remember him and he doesn't want to remember. Tell me... what time did they arrive? It must have been evening... I'm not sure. Round 5. It was raining. That's why I didn't hear them right away. - Is this the way to Gorcza? - Yes. - And whose estate was it? - I hardly knew them. It's a historical place. Langiewicz was supposed to have stayed here. They were captured toward the end of the 1863 uprising just a few miles from here. Gorcza used to be on the Austrian border. Where did they get the horse cart? From the estate. Do you remember the driver? He won't tell you anything. Does this man still work here? We'll ask at the state farm. His name is Madeja. He walked as if he was sick, like this. Did they talk to each other? Yeah, they talked, normal. It's cold or the cart is jerky. - And the boy? - No. Just laid on top of the sacks when they left the station. Must have been asleep. What did they say to him? What? Get up, and that's that. - Do you still have the cart? - Where else would it go? Is that all you know? What else should I know? If it was dark, how could you have recognized Jedrek? It was him. He was covered? Yes, but his head was sticking out, facing me. Was he asleep? He didn't open his eyes even when I shone a light on him. Why didn't you speak to him? It was a moment. I needed a moment to understand it was him, and even then... Even then I wasn't sure. Later on, when I found out everything, I understood that that it was Jedrek. You lived here, on the estate? Yes, first in the annex, then in the cottage. - There were two brothers. - Yes, each had half the house. One had the farm, and the other worked at the rail station. How far did you go with him? - You're asking about the boy? - Yes, which way did you go? Well, the high road goes to the forester's lodge. And the valley will take you to the other village, on the other side of the forest. When we got to the crossroads we stopped. And which way did they go? I don't know. They told me to go back. - You know this cabin? - I know the old forester but I can't remember his name. Tell me, this forester, is he still there? Pieczara? No, no way. He retired. He lives in Slomniki with his daughter. Right... Good bye. All sorts would come to my cabin. Now I remember. This gentleman used to come, too. As for the boy, this is what must have happened: They brought him sick, with typhoid fever, and asked me to keep him over for some time. So we put him up, up there, in the attic. In Novemeber in the attic? It wasn't November. - Summer, it was! - No, no... - November. - Ladka! When did they bring that Cossack? In autumn. You see, it was autumn. Autumn, autumn! I say it was summer. A Cossack? Are you sure about this? - I don't know. - She don't know, don't know. Like if she didn't go see him all the time. No, sir. This story has nothing to do with my son. It was your son? My son was shot then. Or taken into hiding. My son, too, was killed. By the viaduct in Slomniki. He wouldn't let himself be blindfolded. Listen, please. My son was killed by our men. Or perhaps he was hidden somewhere, perhaps he's still alive. I came from abroad, from England, please put this in a safe place. Put the money away somewhere, so your daughter doesn't see, or my elder son. My son was still a boy. He must have blurted out something, by mistake, you understand. Or maybe he went mad out of fear. Or those who killed him were mad. They were taking him in a horse cart to the forest where you worked. You knew them. Lieutenant 'Raven'. Do you remember lieutenant 'Raven'? Raven. Please answer me. Do you remember 'Raven'? Please listen. There was one such... He needed to be holed up because he threatened to tell the Germans. They put him in the Cistercian monastery. Do you know where the monastery is? Thank you very much. You must understand that everyone is gone, and you won't find anyone. Who could have given the order? - Someone higher up. - Where? - At the HQ. Where are they now? These judges? I would like to see them today, old and gray as I am. With their grandchildren, or trying to find out where their children died. Maybe they're riding in the same train car... Maybe we're giving them our seat on the tram, passing them in the street. Don't expect that some old man comes up to you and says: 'It was me who sentenced your son'. And don't think there will be another middle-aged man who will say: 'Yes, it was me who killed him'. I want to find the man who saved his life. Please tell me, is it possible that he would hate you, me, mother so much, everyone whom he knew before these people came for him, that, if he's alive, he keeps quiet? There you go, 15 zlotys a kg. Thank you kindly. Tell me. I've thought for a long time that you want too much from us! Our train to Cracow leaves in 10 minutes. Let's go. I'll take the next one. Explain it as you will, but I'm not coming with you. What else are you looking for? You've run out of questions! You won't understand us. Leave. I beg you. Go back, to your home. You'll come back in a few years, when you've calmed down. My God... Why did I tell you all this? You could have known nothing. Unfortunately, I know very little about these things. I've been at the monastery only for a short time. We have one brother, but... it's hard to think he would be your son. How old would the boy be if he had survived? 37. He was taken in during the war. I don't remember that, I wasn't born yet. Maybe you would like to see our Roman galleries? The first chronicle of our country was written here. No, I must go back. Thank you. Maybe you will come and visit us sometime? I don't think so. Have hope, because hope shall be passed on to future generations, and give them life. But if it dies in you, future generations will be made up of dead men. I will tell you a secret: some souls travel to the sun, and others travel away from the sun, towards dark stars. But you can't understand. I tell you: do not worry about tomorrow, but the day that will be the tomorrow of your death. Yes... I'd like to talk to you. Excuse me, who am I speaking to? My name won't tell you anything. I know why you came here. I'm listening. I suggest we meet. At the caf√© at the Cloth Hall, in half an hour. I found out you were here only by chance. A relative of your wife's. But it doesn't matter who saw you in the street. - You are related to my wife? - No. I knew Marian. I want to tell you everything I know about Jedrek's death. I lived with Marian during the last year of the war, just when this happened. Please tell me... Did Jedrek betray Marian? Are you ordering? - Single coffee for me. - Two coffees. Marian left Zofia in the spring of 1944. He did it for me. In any case, I don't feel guilty because I loved him. - You and Zofia knew each other? - Of course. I would come over nearly every day, bring newspapers, spend the evenings there, sometimes I stayed the night. Zofia considered me Maciek's fianc√©e. And you and Maciek? Maciek was in love with me. When Marian left Zofia's house, Maciek went to Gorcza. Yes. And did Zofia know why Marian left? That I don't know. Probably Maciek, who first realized what was going on between you and Marian... I told him myself. Either Maciek or Jedrek must have told Zofia, and then Marian left the house. And then Jedrek, in order to revenge mother, denounced him. How did he do it? Did he just go to the police? If that was the case, they would have arrested him, too, and Zofia, and you, and your entire organization. Or whatever you were called. No, no, if you only intend to enumerate the sequence of revenge, escape, and betrayal, please spare me. I want to know only one thing. Was Jedrek really murdered? I don't even want to know who did it because it will turn out it was some 'Raven', or 'Vulture', or 'Hawk'... in any case someone without a name, who adopted a heroic name during the war, and today again goes by Stefan or Zygmunt, and is a clerk, or a doctor, maybe a woman... You asked a moment ago what would have happened if he went to the police. I said that he couldn't have gone. Because you're all alive. Marian is dead. Jedrek followed him, stepping on his heels. He waited outside his house. Finally, Marian once caught him, wanted to beat him up, pulled him into a doorway. Jedrek started screaming, fighting, soon there was a crowd... And Marian had to run. There happened to be a military patrol. They shot at him. He was hit. - He died in the street. - How do you know all this? I was there. That's all. I have nothing else to tell you. - One more thing... - Go ahead. No, that's all. That's all. - Your coffee. - Excuse me? They left this morning. But gave me the keys. If you like, I'll get them for you. - They left? - You didn't know? - They left in an ambulance. - What ambulance? - Well, emergency. - What happened? Well, she takes all these pills, sleeps for days, and then as usual, depression, panic attacks. Mr. Maciek went to fetch an ambulance at night, and then to the hospital. There's nothing to worry about. She'll get through it, calm down, it will be all right. Could I have those keys, then? Certainly. - This one. - Thank you. Why didn't he call me? Nothing had happened for over a year. He should have called me. Do you know when Maciek might be back? Probably late. Once he has taken Ms Zofia to the hospital, unfortunately, he likes to get stoned. Otherwise, he's holding up quite well. Excuse me? When you leave, please shut the door. I'm connecting you. Here you go. Thank you. What time's the flight to Warsaw? The shuttle leaves at 2:30pm. I have very little time. Yes. Two hours. And your connecting flight to Berlin is later today. Here are your tickets. - And your passport. - Thank you. - There was a phone for you. Excuse me! Hotel 'Polska'. Who's speaking? Please don't hang up. The connection was broken again. I couldn't help it. Where did the call come from? I don't know... as if from outside Cracow. Someone was asking for you, but the connection was poor. Thank you. I will be in my room. Please speak up, the connection is very bad. - Who's speaking? - I must ask you... Who's speaking? Can you help me? I need help. - I must ask you. - I'm coming. - I need help. - I'm coming right away. I'd like to go, go home. - We'll take care of it. Don't worry. - I'm here to help you. - Thank you. I'd like very much... No, no, you won't stay at the hospital. I'll see to it. Good bye. Thank you for calling me. The End. Subtitles by aileverteRe-sync by Virgil
