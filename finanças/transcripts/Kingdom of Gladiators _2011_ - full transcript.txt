It was my greatest victory the dream of every commander I have deluded myself into thinking I could reunite all the kingdoms under a single flag but further battles would be needed there was more blood to shed for the first time I felt lost it was too late to turn back and too early to declare that foolis war over forever my crown could no longer have stood the weight of more lost lives so it was that in the depths of desperation I raised my eyes to heaven praying that someone infinitely greater than me could help me the gods stayed silent but that very day someone else decided to listen to my pleas what evil thing is this? Who are you?! When someone answers your prayers call it evil I'm here to give you more power to trample over all the principles on which your voice rests. How valuable this tendency is for us king Wolfkhan. What do you want from me? Why are we here? How do you know my name? It's very simple I want to thank you and propose a pact that will put an end to your foolish remorse thank me? What for? For the blood you have spilt over all these years the blood of brave warriors but also blood of the innocent. Guilty of only being on the wrong side of the conflict. You have been an unwitting messenger of death who has made us again as powerful as we once were. Do you want to end the war early and reign as the sole one over the whole continent we are ready to give you what you want. But on one condition each of you heirs must be sacrificed to our dark lord. How can you even think I could accept so foul of an offer? Don't lie to yourself. You already have. Ahahahahahaha! "Over the years. The memory of that day faded. Almost into nothing, years of great victories followed. The destructive fury of our swords was truly awesome. Nothing seemed capable of stopping us. One warm spring the birth of luna, my daughter the overwhelming joy that invaded my heart however was chilled, by a terrible discovery. On luna's chest, there was a mark, like a scar. The demon, had kept it's promise and now I had to keep mine. Please, can you help me? I'm trying to find the king. I have an important message for him. Sword!, where's my sword? The gladiators already warming up in the arena and the king has no sword!? Out, everyone, out of here. Marion, where are you, you witch. Your majesty you really must see her. She looks exactly like your dead queen. I couldn't believe my very eyes. Could it be lorna your lost daughter? Look, I have kept her in a cell apart so no one else may see her you must see her your majesty. I knew you peasants from the lands to the east could handle a hoe but not a sword. If you insist I'll show you where we yocals from the east stick our hoes. Leave him alone kayne you'll have a chance to show this puppet a lesson at the tournament better listen to your little girlfriend yocal besides, it would be more fun watching you eat the mud in front of an arena full of people. So, on his deathbed, the man who I believed to be my father for all those years, told me a story. He said when I was a little baby, he saved me from drowning in the kooney river. He said Miles before he saw some type of mysterious hooded figure throw me in. This is the only thing I have from my past. This little stone. Since then I have traveled around the world looking for this stone. I knew if I found it I'd also find my real parents. I just wanted to ask them why they did this to me. May I burn in hell if ever we were guilty of such infamy. The truth is, someone kidnapped you a few days after you were born. Everything we did to find you came to nothing. I thought I had lost you forever. But fate has decided that we meet again welcome home luna. Keymock will now shine even more brightly than ever before what you need now is rest. Your arrival comes the day before a great tournament that I've announced to celebrate 10 years of peace in our kingdom. It's the perfect way of blessing the festivities. Tomorrow, we shall speak for now, rest. Guard, take her to the royal apartments. Make sure that no one enters without my consents. I advise your majesty to treat this situation with the utmost caution. What do you mean? I don't know but, for now I prefer to remain silent. But there is something about this situation that I do not like. Good!, good! Keep quiet, now don't put a dampener on things for no good reason. Now more than ever, is a time for our kingdom to celebrate. As you wish, your majesty. It's amazing how closely you resemble each other. The same light in your eyes the same rays of sunshine in your hair. Looking at you makes having her back with me, my daughter. You both look so happy in this picture. Yes we were. Your birth brought great joy to our hearts. You should have seen us, we were like newly weds. She would have only be born just a few days. Yet already she had begun to plan every moment of your future. How, how did my mother die? Part of her died the day when you were kidnapped. And then there was that night, but you have plenty of time to learn the history of your family my daughter. Today is the Eve of a very festival here in keymock. And your return would make it an even more memorable event. I want everything to be perfect. In the meantime, I have a surprise for you. A surprise? Yes, I had our best tailors make a special costume so that everyone can see the beauty of king Wolfkhan's daughter! People of keymock! For centuries history has taught us that no army is invincible with the coming of our kingdom history has been forced to re-write it's pages the crowns of the most powerful rulers, have had to bow down before our implacable force thanks to our great warriors, keymock now stands unopposed for splendor and glory. By any other kingdom. That is why, it is our duty now to celebrate their courage but there is another reason to be happy, truth, that the past gives back more thank just thoughts of war and blood. The past can even give us hope of a better future. This, is luna! My daughter, found again! And now, let the tournament begin! Your majesty marigon, bringer of doom, you're missing a great show I asked to talk to you majesty on a matter of the utmost urgency. Go on speak, what have you got to say that's so important. I prefer to talk to your highness in private. Make your words carefully remember you are in presence of the princess of keymock from her there shall be no secrets. I would not dream of offending our princess. So happily amongst us yet again it is simply a matter concerning our lands it would only bore the princess and distract her from the show. So be it, out of my way. These issues had better be really important. Ahhhhh! So say what it is you have to say to me. She is not your daughter. What is this nonsense you are spouting. Luna is not the person she says she is. How dare you! I'll tear our that serpent tongue of yours. She does not bare the scar on her body she was born with you see. It can not be. What do these inscriptions mean? They speak of an ancient prophecy. That ruled before the kingdom of keymock. But why does just looking at it terrify you so much? Yes, I know that I tried to convince myself that it would be the nightmare. I made a pact with it keymock will prevail all kingdoms. And soon. And in exchange the demon asked for the lives of your children. So that's why luna was snatched away all those years ago. Now I finally understand what happened even after then. Yes, it was the price I had to pay. But how did you? Tell me what the prophecy says. The prophecy says that if human sacrifices take place. That the noble blood spilt will awake farmwort a huge titan who will take his armies and conquer the earth. Chaos will begin. Only the children of the pact can kill the monster. But it must happen before the human sacrifice begins. It's time someone knew the truth. I always knew that sooner or later it would come to this. But I never thought it would happen in this way. When is this ritual to take place. I do not know my king the book says nothing about when this will happen. It has already begun. Har! The winner is har! If luna had had to lose you must act now but this time you must trust me. Beware witch, I have already made to many mistakes in my life. The day is coming to a close. And with it the first part of the keymock tournament. Let the evenings feasting begin. At least I fight for a good reason. Tomorrow I show you how you use this. I like you brother. But tonight the tavern waits for us. Aneheel what? Listen to an old story. Two lovers lila and machnan asked a priest in neeheel to marry them in secret. But neheel fell in love with lila. And corrupted machnan to convince lila to kill herself to prove her love. Lila kills herself but machnan runs mad with pain. And neeheel feeds on it becoming a demon and so they call neeheel those demons who live on the suffering of man. And how do you fight them? Only a demon can fight another demon. Lila chose the way of hell to come back to defeat neeheel. But it's just another children's story. Nothing else. Are you still thinking about that story for children. Things can change the whole world changes and I'm beginning to fear that every night could be our last. Things end only when we want them to. The king what you looking for has never been written you know that don't you. I never understood how you thought you'd find the answers to all of your problems in ancient history who are you? Who am I? It's a great question you should know aren't you supposed to know everything maybe.. Hmmm maybe the more important question is what do I know about you maybe I know that your prepared to tell the king everything about me. Maybe hmmm.. I know after my poor mother passed away, you tried to make decisions that were supposedly in the best interests of the kingdom or maybe I know about your most deep and darkest secret every single servant that passes through here has to get specially approved by you. I know, I know exactly what you want. I know exactly what you fantasize about could you imagine a night of pure pleasure with the king's daughter no less. I mean I know you've been with almost every servant here but... Let me ask you something when was the last time you saw a body like this what do you want from me? Are you going to kill me? No, but I'm afraid he is. Kayne follow me destiny often takes roads that are unknown to us only one single person in the world can follow through a nation that for too long awaits a solution that person, is you kayne. And your arrival here in keymock is a sign that none of us can ignore just as no one must know your departure welcome to the second day of the keymock tournament to consecrate the greatness of our king the first warriors will be val from the alterious and teela from romer clean all this up let not a trace remain and not a word to anyone the tournament must go on as though nothing has happened after all no one is going to miss her. Except me old friend, I will. The next fighters are the great istithias from cornio and the great hadran from harcol. Gunnar kayne, what are you doing here? You answer that question that's my business shouldn't you be back at the tournament with your little friend? I've got a sword to find you don't know what your getting yourself into no! You don't know what you've done, don't you understand?

I told you hero, should have stayed down still playing you two? Finally beyond the fall beyond the light beyond time beyond space the truth that which you are, but you do not know twins, 2 twins have cost the queen her life take them away, in opposite directions brothers, that's what you are, blood units you, a pact separates you only the hands of the sons of the pact can hold that which must not be seen the sword with guide your journey the sword of the pact with seal that which must not be seen in the darkness of oblivion hey hey, its over, I am here with you now its over, what ever it was you too were like that moments ago, what happened it was a nightmare it was like something I already knew do you want to tell me what's going on? Father luna, excuse me, I just wanted to make sure that your room here is well worthy of a princess oh yes it wonderful, just like a dream I just want to be prepared for the rest of the tournament I cant wait to see how it turns out yes of course so, you're the children of king Wolfkhan, but how? He kept it hidden from us for a reason but what do I know? All I know is was a lie but how did you get here? The night that we were, ahh, sleeping, I had a visit from Morgan the witch of my, our, father, she told me of a sword and how it would remind me of a past that would belong to me and how I was connected to it she also gave me a crystal viewer, for which I could overcome the swords power and she showed me how I could claim it the king, the king himself told me about this sword it's the only weapon I can use to win the tournament and whoever won the tournament, also takes his kingdom he sent you here separately a better chance the sword would be captured but what does that sword do? Find a father conquer a kingdom prevent a monster from conquering the world well what are we waiting for? Once you have found the sword you must search for the two waterfalls follow the sun at sunset and the darkest part of your sole the doors to hell will close only the sole asks to go beyond the entrance sacrificing his eternity to the black world of the demons teela what are you doing?
