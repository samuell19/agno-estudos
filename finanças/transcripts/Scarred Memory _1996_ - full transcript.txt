- Good morning. - Good morning. To room 3. Go to register. How did she get hurt? Her mum hit her. She wanted to escaped and fell down from the stairs. How high did she fall from? 12 or 13 feet. Her mum is mentally ill. She always vents her anger on her. Alright... When did you fall? Have you vomited? No. What is your name? Dr. Yip. What's the matter? A patient was injured in a construction site. He's over there. |s his pulse fast? Systolic pressure 100, diastolic pressure 60. Set a drip for him. Give him some oxygen. How much? 40. D5 or normal saline? Normal saline, QS I want a male doctor. I don't want to be touched by a female doctor. Never touched by a woman? Do you believe it? It's the first time someone discriminates against me like this. Female patients always complain that... we touch their breasts. A female patient? One without sugar, one without milk. Thanks. You've got dark circles under your eyes. ReaHy? The patients are more troublesome, so I have to work late. You're destined to be a nurse, not a doctor. The case mentioned last time is true. Really? The case about the test-tube twin babies. Is it so serious? One black, one white. The hospital is being sued. They're too stupid. It's not that bad. At least she's got one baby of her own race. Right. But her husband is yellow. Here comes the person who can give you baby without using test tubes. Go to hell! What are you talking about? One black, one white. One black, one white? Can I listen? I think it's not very suitable for you. Sorry. I put some milk in it. You don't take it with milk, do you? She has changed. Women change all the time. I think it tastes good with milk. Try it. To be honest, I admire your courage. If that thing happened to me, I would have gone crazy. Ivy, are you alright? Flora, do I look like that kind of person? Don't cheat yourself. I'm a doctor. I won't cheat myself. But you're a woman. Even if a child is hurt, it takes a period of time for him to recover. |t' more that two months now. I have forgotten everything. Moreover, it's just an interaction of two organs. From the medical aspect, it's as simple as handshake and kiss. Good. You got it at last. You still have... a very supportive boyfriend, Tom. That's right. What if he leaves you? Well, I've got you. Flora Help! Help! Dr. Yip, you'd better be honest. If you abet that scoundrel, he will continue to harm other people. When we found you, your clothes were untidy. It seems to be not just robbery. Why don't you... Why don't you tell them that tonight we... Officer. Both my girlfriend and I are doctors. Our personal affairs... She doesn't want... to let the colleagues in the hospital know. If you don't want to talk about it, no one is going to ask you anymore. We're adults. We'll forget it very soon. It's not your fault. |'ll love you even more. Let's get married. What would you like for breakfast? Anything will do. Shall we make some... Dr. Yip. Dr. Yip, shall we set a drip for him? What shall we do? The patient is going to be in shock. Dr. Chan, the patient is in danger. Please go to see him. What about the blood pressure? The pulse and the blood pressure are too low. Can't measure. Defibrillate him. Clear! Return to normal. Give him sodium bicarbonate. Okay. Give him cross match. How much? Five packets. The blood pressure drops to 70/40. Give him one more packet of plasma. Quick. Set the central venous pressure. Okay. Blood pressure 80/60. |t's stable. Push him to the Intensive Care Room. From my point of view, under any circumstances, the patient's safety is the most important. But... We're just human beings. But a doctor should know how to control himself. Like Dr. Yip, she ignored the safety of the patient. She should be held responsible for it morally. She should control her feelings. Shit! Have you assumed any moral responsibility then? Before sleeping with that woman, have you controlled your feelings? Dr. Yip. I hope you'll think about your status... when you speak. Had you thought about your status... when you slept with Flora? Dr. Yip. Dr. Yip, are you alright? Let's start the hearing. Dr. Lee, Dr. Yip. How was the patient at that moment? Any mishandling? According to the patient's record on the ambulance, even if there was no delay, he might also get into a vegetative state. I want to transfer to |.C.U. Dr. Yip speaking. Ivy? Don't hang up. Ivy, I don't want to bother you. Dr. Given is an authority on neurology in America. He has come to Hong Kong. Shall we go to see... No. I am partially responsible for it, right? One without sugar, one without milk. We both got drunk that day. I couldn't control myself. I'm sorry. Tom really cares for you. He just... can't get used to you being a different person at night. He has been suffering. He is in a bad mood now, so... Are we still friends, |vy? I have changed my taste. Who are you? Hey! What are you doing here? Do you remember your name? No response. Right, Dr. Lee. Give him a neurological examination tomorrow. Okay. Mum...mum. Dr. Yip, a call for you. Go and question him. Yes, sir. Dr. Yip? |t's Dr. Chan. We've come to... a preliminary conclusion for the case. Please come to my office. Lee Yuen-lung, who did it? Speak! Don't pretend! Is it the one who hurt you last time? Speak! Shut up! Will you shut up! What are you doing? He knows who is the murderer. He's just pretending to be ignorant. |tell you. He is my patient. This is hospital. I think he's not fit for questioning. Okay? Push him away. His doctor is male. How can he be your patient? Dr. Lee. I want to talk to you. Why did you change doctors for the patient? We don't want you to take care of this patient... because you're too emotional. What have you done? I think you need a rest. |'m clear about my condition. I don't need any rest. The higher authorities are still investigating your case. You might be fired. Don't you know? Yes, I know. Take good care of the patient. |vy I know it's my fault. Give me one more chance. No way. Iiust want you to give me a chance to compensate for it. Maybe you need help. No matter it's work or money problem, |'ll offer you help at once. Don't you remember we have been in love for two years? It's my fault. But don't you understand? It has nothing to do with drinking. We shouldn't be ashamed to lose face. I do need a woman... who belongs to be entirely. A real woman? I thought I could make it at first. But I'm just like any other man. I can't accept it. I can't accept such a woman. I don't want to be the man who rapes you. I don't! Every time I hold you, I have this kind of feeling. I'm no longer a doctor. I want to be another person. Nobody will know me. Nobody. Let me kiss you. Stop! Hey! Stop! I want to play too. Cat, quick! You make me itch! I'm bored. You skill of chasing girls is terrible. Matt, your skill is terrible. I've already given you the chance. Don't complain. Don't you know this |vy is very difficult to chase? What are you doing? Investigation, I want to find out the identity of my tenant. I've known you for a few months. You don't have... You don't need sex? What time is it? The sun is setting. What time is it? Who looks better? Roy or Matt? You know better than me. No, the one who does it with me round the clock is Roy. Matt wants to chase you, not me. Don't you know? He is making love to you... when he looks at you. Can it be done with eyes only? If so, I don't have to keep fit anymore. Cat. I think you like women. Don't you need any man? Be careful not to become sexually indifferent. Nothing can't be done then. You'd better have a check-up. Doctor Yamamoto, why do you climb onto the bed? Read it out more clearly. If we don't know what it's about, how are we going to enjoy it? Your kiss make me excited. Don't stop. I'll never leave you again. More feeling, okay? I'll stay by your side to give you comprehensive treatment. Your narration is shit. I'm like this. Sorry. You're not going to wait for your mother? Fatty, give me a glass of beer. Hi, |vy. You scared me. You lost your high heel again? Someone is following me. So many people follow you? Nobody is there. Will there be so many people willing to follow you? Me is different. We got a streetful. All those people outside. See? There's really a man staring at you. Let me go and check it out. Why are you standing here? I'm looking for that girl in a red dress. She doesn't know you. Mr. Policeman, he's been standing here staring at us for a long time. There must be something wrong. Don't stand here. Go home. I can't go home. Are you lame? You can't go home? Mr. Policeman, he's fooling you. You're pretending. I really don't know how to go home. You're lying. You're a grown up. You don't know how to go home? No one will believe it. Show me your ID card. I bet he hasn't got any. Your |d card! Don't you understand? Don't play the fool. Take it out. Yours. |know him. I must return this shoe to you. Why? |'m lame. I don't want other people to walk like me. Thanks for bringing me back. Six o'clock! What you are doing? My mother is waiting for me. Mother, I'm coming. Where have you been? You promised to wait for me here at 6 every day. You're always messing around. Give it to me. If it happens again, I don't want you anymore. Although he's much better now, I think I still owe him so much. Go to hell! Go to hell, idiot! More accurate. Stop it! Let's go... Why do you let them fool you? So dirty! Don't pick it up. Kitty, food. Sit down. Let me help you. Don't think that I'm so stupid. Why did you draw a circle? This is my world. I can draw it as large as I want. It's better than my mother. She always takes me to watch that film. My mother takes advantage of that fellow in the cinema all the time. She says there is free air-conditioning. But I like this place better. Mother, I'll take these things back first. Alright, you go first. Mother is back. I have to go back upstairs. Let's chat again at the back stairs tomorrow afternoon, okay? Brother, let me help you. Go away! You look stupid enough. No need to act like a clown. Wash it yourself. Have you left this place? Have you stepped outside the circle? Mother. Where is the rice? You gave it to the cat again? You prodigal! What a mess! Mother, my friend. You can't take care of yourself. How can you take care of your friend? Why don't you have your meal? I wouldn't cook for you next time. Why did you bring her home? Go to take a bath. Mother, she's a good person. What are you doing? Can you stop dancing? Auntie, your son needs physiotherapy. You're the one who has problem. Crazy! You want to dance like them? If you listen to me... I will listen to you. If you listen to me, you'll be able to be like them. You mean I can dance? I can find my way home? Yes. I can have a new life? I can have sex life? What did you say? A 30-year-old should have his sex life. That's what the doctor said in the film. You're a good person. I trust you. Will you be able to cure me? Maybe. Maybe? You must cure me. | support you. You support me? How? 1, 2, 3, raise your leg. Try harder. Try harder. Hold on. Ah...| can't. Hold on. It'll be alright. I must be more diligent. Do more exercises. Then I'll be able to recover soon... and become a normal person again. That's right theoretically. But I've forgotten everything. It takes time. Are you a doctor? No. Only a doctor can cure his patient. Can you be a pseudoductor temporarily? No. You're a doctor. I'm not a doctor. You are. No, I'm not. Stop making such a noise! You make me lose money. I'm not playing. Settle up. Don't get angry. Even if you lost money, you shouldn't scold your son. Kids learn from bad examples easily nowadays. Your fate is going to be like Wing Hing Kee's sooner or later. Either killed in a fire or annoyed to death by his son. Is your son as smart as him? Wing Hing Kee's son, Lung, used to be the boss in Wanchai. Look at him, He's become such a stupid fellow. They're talking about me. I was like that before. You have forgotten? Don't talk about the past. I'll try to learn more new things... and be good. They will like me. That's why you let those kids throw tomatoes at you. It made them feel happy. Auntie, Lung is very positive. He is recovering quickly. I don't know. Last time his brain was injured. |t affected his memory... and organizational ability. - |f... - I don't care. Go home after you have eaten. Auntie. Since you brought him here, you should take him back. Lung brought me here. He knows who to find his way. Can't you see that he can control his hands and legs now? I don't see anything. My eyesight is bad and I can' hear very well. Who do you think you are? I didn't stop you taking him everywhere. Don't bother me! The meal's ready. Give him some stimulation. Help him remember things in the past. He'll recover sooner. What's the use of it? I'm already very happy now that he can walk himself. If he can take care of himself in the future, I'll have to thank God. Don't bother me. Iiust want to live happily. Brother, look how beautiful is it! How old are you? Still playing with this kind of thing. Go away! Amitabha... There was a fire here? I don't expect you to eat here. No matter how bad the weather is, mother'll come here to pray. Help me... She must have prayed to the ancestors to bless you. Mother won't bless me. Everybody knows she hates me. My brother hates me too. Take your time. Be careful. If you did something wrong, you couldn't turn back. Don't worry. They'll accept you sooner or later. It's not big deal. Whenever I see them scolding me fiercely... and that my mother's forehead is wrinkled, I think they're pitiable. That's right. It's too stupid. Same as you, you're always down. Me? I can't imagine. Turn around. I can't turn. |'m useless. You're a loser. My legs can't turn. It has nothing to do with your legs. If you give up now, nobody will respect you. You're dancing very well. Good. Thank you very much. Amitabha... Why do you keep walking up and down the whole night? I have to sleep! Are you crazy? Making so much noise the whole night. Go to wash your face. Mother. What is it? I want to see the pseudodoctor. Do you know how to get there? I have a map. You don't know how to come back. You didn't tell me which floor you live on. How did you come here? I have walked for four hours. Stay there. Wait a moment. I'll come down in a minute. First floor, second floor. First floor, second floor. I know how to get there. Are you feeling happy? Will people with low intelligent like you... have any response? Are you excited? Do you want to touch it? Come, I'll let you touch it. What are you doing? He is purer that distilled water. You're cr az y! He's coming. He's coming. Speak it out. The dirty cat has fallen into the water. Go to save the dirty cat quickly. The dirty cat is right over there. Quick, quick... Dirty cat, I'm coming to save you. Where is it? The dirty cat is here. You have been cheated. How stupid you are! Go it hell, idiot! Go to hell, idiot! The boat is too far away. We can't hit him. Aim at it accurately. Use more strength. Go to hell, idiot! What are you doing? Let's go. Lung, don't move. I'm coming to save you. Help! You don't know how to save him. Go away! I'm a doctor. Put him down. She's a doctor. God bless you, my son. Amitabha... We were only joking. We cheated you. He could swim in the past. He even put my head into the water and made him drink it. He spits the water out. He wakes. He's safe. Don't bother Lung. Let him go! Don't harm him. Lung, be careful. The doctor saved your life. Take a rest. You'll be fine. Don't curse your brother anymore. He's half dead now. Don't fool him. My daughter, I know you did not go willingly. Your brother is bad. He shouldn't set fire to the factory to obtain insurance to repay debts. He annoyed your father to death. But he didn't intend to kill you. He didn't know that you were in the factory. He has suffered a lot. Run!... Run, sister! Run! Run! Fire! Sister didn't go away. She went to get the mooncake. Don't burn my sister! Don't burn my sister! Don't! I want to see my sister. Drown him! Drown him! Go to hell! You deserve it! It's better to die. Then you don't have to suffer. Right, drown him! Why did you save me? I owe you. No. Nobody ever owes me anything. I'm a scoundrel. |'m hopeless. I can't turn back. Don't behave like this. You still have chance. I can't remember how bad I was in the past. Fortunately, I've got you to support me and help me. Only you treat me like a human being. You're a human being. You'll hurt yourself easily. Let me help you. You haven't recovered yet. How can you help us? I want to help you open the shop. - Can you? - No problem. Drink some water. Take a rest. It's very heavy. Don't do it if you can't. Don't move it all at once. Carry me... I've got something for you. Do you want some? I have a present for you too. Do you like it? Here comes the food. Happy birthday, Lung's mother. Thanks... Lung, it's time for meal. It's the first time mother asks me to eat. Mother, wish you longevity. Good boy. Wish you good health. Go out, Cat. Open the door. It won't take long. I'm sorry. Come over, Matt. | help Matt chase her. He ditched me. Who cares about him? You open it at last. Lover letter? A letter from the hospital. Why do you cry? You used to take things easy. If I can cry for a man, I'll be much happier. ReaHy? We are not the same. My parents died when I was very young. It makes me feel safe... to sleep with a man every night. I don't know... whether I want to screw him or just want to smell his odour. Would you stop playing this kind of game? Every kind of game gives you different delight. Otherwise, you won't be with me now. The game you're playing is much more difficult. You have already recovered. I don't have much to do in Macau. Is there no other excuse for you to stay behind? I have to go sooner or later. It's too late. She has gone. Do you feel dizzy? Did you vomit? Yes. Are you allergic to any medicine? No. Don't worry. Go there to register first. Come over here. Does it hurt? Remove the plaster. Don't worry. - Hi! - Hi! - How are you? - I'm fine. You look pretty good. Of course. I've taken such a long rest. You are getting marry soon Yes. Remember to invite me to your wedding feast. Okay. I'm happy that you're getting on so well. Pseudodocter. I have something to talk to you. Speak it out. I ought to hate you. But I can't when I see you. To tell the truth, you shouldn't go away like this. You're too callous. How do you come here? Swimming? By plane. I'm not very articulate. I was upset when you left. I've tried very hard to control myself but I fail. You have difficulty in breathing? A heart failure? Pupll... I know you're a real doctor. Yes. I think I have fallen in love with you. The scenery is beautiful here. Which is better? Macau or Hong Kong? I'm a straight person. Don't tell me so many things... which I can't understand. What's it? I miss you very much. So I come to Hong Kong to find you. You're here now. I want you to be with me. I'll give you everything, housing, food, clothing. Be my girlfriend. But we haven't started yet. I thought you have the same feeling as I do. I found the most satisfactory job at last. Here. This is my goal. The first step. Good. You can provide housing, food and clothing for me then. I saw you. Hit that one. Missed... Why did you photograph me? Do you know why he photography me? No, maybe you're handsome. People say I look like Andy Lau. Got it! Lung. Why are you eating so fast? Kids, we're closing. Go!... You close so early? Let us play for a while longer. Go home to sleep. Please, let us play. Alright, alright. Go... Thank you. Lung, the machine inside... seems to have broke down. Sit down first. Let's go. They're closing. Go...let's go home. Ma'am. You close so early? Is there anybody inside called Lee Yuen-lung? The one who comes from Macau. You're looking for Lung? He's in the storeroom. You can't come in. Who are you looking for? Don't you recognize me? Did we know each other? I don't remember. You don't remember? You don't remember anything? But I think I'll remember sooner or later. If it's something happy, I will remember it. Give me some time. Lung, there is a... Run! Put it down! The inspector is coming. Please wait a moment. I want to talk to your patient, Dr. Yip. What's the matter? I'm busy. Brother Shing, have a cup of tea first. We have brought your big brother here to see you. I'll wait for you outside. No need to pretend. You'll see. The victim is called Lee Tsang-kwok. Do you know him? Why did he want to kill you? I don't know. You must have seen him. Where? Is he that murderer in the hospital? I don't know. He knew you. That's why he went to the fairground to find you, right? I don't know him. What is your relationship with him? Steal that batch of goods from big brother. We'll split it fifty-fifty between us. Do you have a any secret? I suspect that you collaborate to kill Kwok. That's not true. Now nobody will ever know what happened between you two. Don't. You killed him because you wanted to take revenge. I don't know him. I need the money desperately. He killed your henchmen, so you wanted to take revenge. Right, Inspector Wong. Dr. Yip, you may go now. But between you leave, go and have a look at your friend. Where is he? In the third room in front. We're not going to charge him now. But if he can't give his big brother any reasonable explanation, his big brother won't let him go. You'd better persuade him to cooperate with us. Send someone to open the way. Drive him to the hospital quickly. Lung, you'll be alright. You must hold on. You have promised... You have promised to take care of me. Don't you remember? Don't worry. You're with me. I won't let them harm you. I've wasted the congee you bought. It's good to resume memory. You said you could manage it. I think it's difficult to settle the dispute between big brother and me. Let me help you. Leave it alone. Let me help you. Don't be so naughty. Want me to pick your ear? It's itching. I'll get you some water. Help!... Brother, happy birthday! I'm Ivy. I'm not home. Please leave your message after the beep. What's happened, Ivy? You seem to disappear all of a sudden. Have I done something wrong? I want to see you. Why did you hide away from me? Brother Shing asked us to come. Go to see him quickly and explain to him about that batch of goods. Don't make things difficult for us. Why him? Why? Yours. I don't remember. I don't want to know anything. I don't want to think about it or mention it anymore. Nothing happened at all. It's Lung again. I want to tell you. Big Brother is looking for you everywhere. I'm going back to Macau now. Mother wants me to start a new life. She has mortgaged the factory to the bank. I'll use the money to repay Brother Shing. You used to be most supportive. Where are you now? Meet me at the lighthouse where we used to go often. Ivy, you must come. I think you won't come. I want to tell you. I really love you. There's something important which I haven't told you. I didn't speak it out because I don't want you to worry. Maybe you don't care about it. I don't know what Brother Shing will do... to me. Perhaps I won't be able to see you again. But I'll try my best to overcome my fear of the past. I have promised you that even if I'm not here... Ivy I've tried. Brother Shing. Lung, you want to turn against me? Big Brother, I just want to be an ordinary man. Give me a chance. When you stole that batch of goods from me, had you thought about giving me a chance? Kwok did it. You have guts! To lay the blame on a dead person. Take my life. I don't expect that I can go home alive. What a nerve! I have followed you for so long and helped you so much. I'll give you this sum of money and then we're even. How dare you shout at me like this! Lung. Since there are few people here, I'll tell you. I didn't have an easy time either. I lost my right-hand men suddenly. I could hardly do anything when Blind Fai humiliated me. Lung. Everything is over now. Come back to help me. You still owe me gratitude. You're the first person I thought of... when we were in danger just then. Now I know... you're the only person whom I care for. Are you hiding something from me? There's something which you never need to know. Don't behave like this. Be good. Get on the train. No! I want to buy the doll. My hands are full. I'll buy you one next time. No. I want to buy it now. The doors will close soon. Hurry up! Thank you, Mr. I'll wait for you at the next station. Don't cry. Be good. My little girl, don't cry. Say thanks to uncle. Be good. You're like a cry-baby. Look! All the people are looking at you. What ashame! Baby. I'll buy you one later. Don't cry... Don't cry. People are looking at you. Big brother, happy birthday! You said that you'd wait for me at the next station, didn't you? Today... What's the excuse this time? There was a traffic jam underground. What an excuse! Wait a moment. Mother, eat. You should come back to dinner more often. Have you fixed the radio yet? It'll be ready in two days. Get it fixed quickly so that mother can listen to it. I come to settle the debt. I want you to do something for me. Punish Blind Fai for me. Lung. Why? If only nobody knew the truth. I'll be fine. I can release myself. But your eyes tell me that you can't. I thought I could look upon it as nothing had happened at all. But it is too selfish, I can't. Why? Why don't you give yourself some more time? Why don't you give us a chance? I don't have the courage. I can manage to survive all kinds of difficulties. But I can never forget that... I have harmed my beloved before. I can't. I'm s o rry I Iv Y Lung, I can't live without you. Me too. That's why I did this. Lung...
