March 28th, 1994 Evening of the election results Silvio Berlusconi… has won his battle. I'd say he won it with great courage.. Despite everything and everybody. Why? Because he won despite the majority of the press and radio and TV media. Despite all those who advised him, as friends, not to take such a step. I won't be revealing a secret when I say that today he called me while on his way to Rome, to reap the rewards of this much deserved victory. A conversation, I'd say, between friends. He already sounded like a politician, already creating a certain distance between my former director and me, the head of one of his news programs. I, who for five years, could work here in total freedom. What do you think? What can I say? I'll take a deep breath. - It's happened, it's happened. - Unfortunately... Despite the promises of the leaders of the left-wing party, the PDS, their presence on the scene has been very sparse. A complete and utter absence! The results are so embarrassing that the leaders refuse all comment. We've asked them to come down, but they couldn't. Come on, get ready! If you win, you prepare a speech, a nice suit and face. You go down and speak. If you lose - and we always lose - you make a solid and dignified statement. It's 11:30 and no one's there yet! On the evening of March 28, 1994, when the right won for the first time in my life, I smoked a joint. Marijuana. What can I do? I was saying that my son, at school, when they asked what his father did, answered, My dad is a TV repair man. And now, I'll have to explain to him that his dad won't have time to fix TV sets… because he'll have to fix Italy. We've followed your elections from France. The Prime Minister owns three TV stations? - Yes. - This couldn't happen in France. There's a law. Don't you have antitrust laws? Yes. Yes and no... not really. I'd like to understand. How do Italians live with this? Don't you realise? It's comical, picturesque. A democracy with a fascist party governing. But, a transformation's under way in that party. They've merely changed their name. They're the same! You should make a documentary on Italy. On politics. Full of humour but also with a civic sense. You've lost your memory. Your country must take stock again. Yes, our country must take stock, as the French journalist points out to me. After the Right's election win, there's a lot of talk about the Resistance - the motivation of the partisans and that of the Fascists. The dead on both sides. The motivation of both. As a sort of reaction, on April 25th, the anniversary of the liberation from the Nazis, there's a big demonstration in Milan. I decide to film it. But it rains all day. And I film nothing but umbrellas. Umbrellas, umbrellas... For it's the symbol of imprisonment "JOY OF MEMORY" Will we fly the black flag? No! Will we fly the red flag? Yes! Will we fly the red flag? Yes! For it's the symbol of liberation Will we the red flag? Yes! 00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,296 For it's the symbol of liberation Will we the red flag? Yes! A year and a half later A year and a half has gone by since the March 94 elections. The right-wing government has fallen. I'm working again on the musical I've been thinking about for a while. A period movie set in the 1950s. I'm working on an old project, a film about a pastry chef. - I never mentioned it. - You did, nine years ago. I even tried costumes. I still have them, if they're any use. I'm not sure yet. It's strange, this film... I start working on it, then move away from it. - I think it's a really good subject. - Really? I feel good about the film, bodies, dancing... I even took lessons. The teacher was very pleased. Remember? You came once. I turned down a film to do it, remember? - Well, anyway... - It was never made, fine. It happens. Without obligation on your part, I'll call the dance teacher. - It's a bit early. - No obligation. It's for me. To loosen myself up. Nine years doing nothing. Nothing new. Silvia's translating. I'm preparing a film for who knows when. Any other news? No, everything's fine. Silvia's fine. I can tell you know. You're beating around the bush. Thank you. We know it'll change our lives. For the better, right. I'm ready, Silvia's ready. We're ready, yes, we're all ready. Here she is now. Bye. Fine, everything's fine. I'm at the end of the third month. A little nausea, but no big deal... But Nanni's having dizzy spells. What did he say? To stay calm. Not to tire myself. To stay calm. Not to tire myself. - Calm... Total rest! - Not that! Stay at home. Maybe put the TV in the bedroom. I don't like that idea... He's due in mid-April? He's due on the 13th, yes. Emma Thompson was born around that date. Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino... Let's hope he's not an actor. What do you mean, Let's hope? - We'll forbid him to be an actor. - We'll forbid him to be an actor. The first day on the set Take the coat away. Spread out a little bit. The camera's here. You two, a little further away. And you come here. - The car, Andrea, more this way! - Back a little? - By one metre. - Back one metre... The musical at last! It's the first day on the set. - With The jacket? - Should we try without? Yes, it's better. No, no good. - Do we start The musical track? - Yes. Nicola, go on! We're on a break, everybody's going to eat. I haven't done a single shot yet. Yesterday, I had worked them all out one by one, Angelo. Listen I don't know if... - if I can shoot this. - Why do you say that? Shooting a musical... I'm not up to it... We have to postpone again. Tell them, please. I don't have the guts. Andrea, we're going home. Marcello, we've finished. - Should We load up? - Yes. Roberto, let's load up. Excuse me... Look, I'm sorry, but Nanni isn't up to it. - Is he ill? - He's not up to shooting. - Today? - No, the film's cancelled. - Cancelled? - Yes. - For good? - Yes. You know what this job's like... Exactly! So let me do it! These things happen. How? It's never happened to me! What can I do? This is a serious problem, you know. I turned down a seven-month theatre stint. Salvatores had written a cameo part just for me... - It's too late now. - So, talk to Andrea... Why did it happen? What did he tell you? Nothing. He's not up to it... - Doesn't he like the way I dance? - It's not that. He seemed happy enough at rehearsals. It's not that... - Let me talk to him. - Nanni! - Not now. - See Andrea and Angelo instead. - What for? Spring 1996 Election Day approaches A little time has passed. In a few weeks… there'll be another general election. Either the Right will win and stay in office for God knows how long... or the Left will win for the first time. I've stopped thinking about the musical. No, I'd like to make a documentary on these elections. And, in general, a documentary on Italy. We must make this documentary on Italy. It's our duty. We must do it. We want to do it. People abroad want to understand what's happening here. We'll start by stocking up on newspapers and more newspapers. We'll buy them all. And we'll record the news on Berlusconi's channels... And the usual shows, like Harem... - It's not on any more. - What's on then? - "Pasha". - We'll record Pasha then. Not the real crap, OK? You know my taste... Shows that try to be... But instead are... And we need to film the election campaign... We have to make this documentary. - What's wrong? - We were just... You're not committed to this project! Your lack of trust is palpable. Andrea, it's our duty! I have to make this documentary. Do you want to shoot election dinners, public debates or do you want to follow candidates in markets? No markets or electoral dinners. We'll stick to filming rallies. Almost close-up. Fixed camera. Hi, How are you? My Garden, Gardenia Dogs: A Pedigree Magazine, Be, Fly, Run, My Condominium, Sport and Shoes, Lisa Biondi's Specialities, Pasta Monthly, Villas and Houses, Old Houses, Sirius, "Astra" Progressive Photography, L'Espresso. Can I order covers of L'Espresso from the last ten years? It's for research. Bowline, Biking, Corriere della sera. La Stampa, Dinghy, Mountains, Wood and Stone La Repubblica, Wheels and Deals, Archeo, Beautiful Italy, Airone. A chapter of my documentary on Italy is devoted to journalism. I start cutting, clipping, pasting and glueing... And I realise the papers are all the same. Above all, they always hire the same journalists. The same one can write about politics in a daily, cinema in a left-wing weekly, and literature in a right-wing weekly. The same one can write in "Corriere della Sera" "Woman's Weekly" and the "State Railway Monthly". And, of course, cartoons and political satire everywhere. Because satire has no master so any master will do. You end up with one enormous newspaper. I'm ready, I'm almost ready Do you want the cot here? In the corner, the changing table will be here. OK. And the stencil with the little animals? About here. - How's it going? - Fine. - Do you want me to help? Best if you don't. - Best if you don't. Don't move. There. What is it they say about the stomach? If it's round, it's a girl... A pointy one is a boy. - and yours is? - Pointy. - Are you sure? - Yes. Just a sec... It looks as if it's getting rounder at the back... No, it has to be round all over. Mine's all at the front. At the front... Mario, Sergio, Alberto, Fabrizio, Mauro, Roberto, we've said no. - Matteo ? - That's nice. It sounds good too. Matteo Moretti… - Matteo, Tommaso. A bit trendy... - Maybe. Too popular... No. - Fabio ? - It's simple. Fabia would be prettier if it was a girl... Maybe they got it wrong. Sometimes they say it's a boy and it's a girl! - It's the other way round. - They say it's a girl but it's a boy. Amos ? Federico. Imposing. Yes, serious, maybe too imposing. An adult's name. He'll grow up one day. Anyway, not Federico. - Giovanni, like me? - No, we can't. We don't want to, you mean! It's not allowed by law. - Not allowed? - Of course. Unless it was a girl, Giovanna... Hi, Mum. Yes. No, we've eaten. We finished the qualifying round. Simone ? Should I ask Mum? No, we'll decide. Simone's nice. We've done the qualifiers, we're onto the quarter finals. Yes, we went last evening. How was "Heat"? You know, it's a cop who meets a crook. The crook has just killed 300 people. Then he meets the cop chasing him and they realise... that deep down they're similar, they both love their work. You know - good and evil, two sides of the same coin. Mum asks how the actors were? De Niro, Al Pacino... how were they? Al Pacino gets more and more handsome. - That's beside the point... - It's not! We're talking about characters, structure... Silvia says Al Pacino gets more and more handsome. Shorter and shorter too. Yes. I'll speak to you this evening. Bye, Mum. All right, we've got eight names left - Luigi and Andrea, Franco and Pietro, Luca and Gabriele, Marco and Simone. ...the colour is very soft. - Nice. Cotton. This one is white cotton, too, with bunnies. We've got things, too. This is a hat. And this is really cute. It's so soft. - Shall we show them our things, Mum? - Wait. Gigetta made this sweater. Amusing. This is the blanket my mother made. She made it herself. And... not the plain shoes, I asked you for... Here they are. White with blue trim and blue with white trim. And the plain shoes. White with blue stripes. For tennis and basketball, Grey and white ones too. - and this one as well. - Nice. I like the colour. Leaving Las Vegas Babe, Dead Man Walking... A bit sad. It's still too soon. The theme's important, you know... Stone's Nixon... We've already seen Underground. The Usual Suspects too... - We've seen it. - "City hall" ? - Yes, yes... No, I don't like that cinema. Pietro has to get used to good screenings, proper focus, good sound. Strange days. Have you ever wired up? Ever done a teletrip? No, never. A virgin brain! That's a good start. - You really want to wire up? - Yes, I want to. See that Filipino babe over there? See the guy she's dancing with? Would you like to be in his shoes for 20 minutes? The right 20 minutes? With me, you can... And you'll keep your wedding ring clean too. It's my fault! I took my son to see that memorable garbage! These films influence children. They influence their personality. Who knows what kind of personality they'll have. The children born in 1996. Aries. Their motto - "Always win the day." I'm ready. I'm almost ready. Not quite ready. If you could wait a month and a half... - a month and a half? - Yes, a month and a half. Six or seven weeks. I'll be ready by end of April. Your tummy was higher this morning. Has it dropped? - Maybe. - What do you mean, maybe? - What do you mean, is he in position? - Yes. Pietro ! Pietro, it's daddy here. I need another month and a half. I have to shoot the documentary that I mentioned. I want to shoot the Right's and the Left's campaign. The Centre Left's... The Centre-Centre Left's. They insult us but we mustn't react. Definitely not! We must reassure the people. We must reassure them. I don't want to see this. It's torture. This campaign is sheer torture. I hope it ends soon. D'Alema, do something! … The problem in this country ... is that magistrates...… persecute political opponents. And in a democratic country... one shouldn't allow… D'Alema, say something! React! ...politically committed people to judge their enemies. Say something! D'Alema, reply! Don't be pulled up on justice by Berlusconi! D'Alema, say something left-wing! Not even left-wing, just something civilised! Dis quelque chose. React! We mustn't react. Keep a cool head. We must reassure. Reassuring people will lead to a whipping. I want to argue with someone! I'll find another motorist and get myself beaten up. I need to argue! Luchetti's shooting an ad tonight! He's shooting an ad... You can see it's cold. Warm it up! It has to steam! - OK, I'll heat it up. - Steam. I don't see why we should shoot ads. It's not so strange. Many top directors shoot ads once in a while. - Sure. - Lynch, Polanski, Ridley Scott, Kiarostami... Not Kiarostami! - Fellini and Woody Allen, then. - True, I can't deny that. You can see it's cigarette smoke. It has to be really hot. If you tried to focus, you'd make more films... I've made more films than you! That's true. Basil or parsley on the tomatoes? - Basil. - Let's put some on then. I feel you're wasting your time. - Wasting my time? - I am too... - When did you last shoot? - I'm doing a documentary. - No, a film. - A real film Nanni, how long has it been? A very long time. - You came here to argue! - No, I'll keep out of the way, I'll let you work. Alessandro, how about a light inside the pasta? Yes, to glorify the sauce. - We could make a hole in The table... - With a circular saw. In the first stage of labour you have contractions. Labour... I don't have to be there. Of course you do. It's a little painful but... A little painful... How was the Yehoshua book? - Good. - All his books are. The first stage? The contractions become more frequent. It's painful but... How long is it? Because my head, you know... 358 pages ! I only read short stories nowadays. Short stories, very short. The phone. It's so light, look at this! Yes, Linda. Silvia wants to talk to you. Have a bit of a chat. Hello. Hi, Linda. I was telling Nanni about the birth. Can I call you back? OK, sorry. It's so light, look... - The important thing... - Know who designed them? Giugiaro, a designer. He designed them. Very light. And the Uno too. - Concentrate. - The Uno, the car... - And rigatoni! But it didn't work because the sauce kept slipping off. In the second stage, that is very painful... you mustn't panic. I know I'll panic. - Not you, the woman! - and can men panic? The man stands there and says, That's good, nearly there. Look what my mum... Look what she gave me. Socks with blue diamonds... Red, green... - There isn't any. - No green? - I'll change them. We've finished talking. - No, not yet. The last stage. - After the very painful second stage... - very painful. You go to the delivery room... In the delivery room, little one! Remember that daddy needs a lot of sleep. Long, uninterrupted sleep. You get behind me and the obstetrician is in front of us. And you have to support me. And who supports me? And then... Madonna wants to give birth at home like in the olden days. She has a delivery room in her mansion. Interesting. It's interesting in Milan too, where there's Salvati against Berlusconi against Bossi. Did Di Pietro say who he'd vote for? No, but his spokesman is running with the Left... But his brother-in-law is with the Right, the CCD. The Christian Democrat emblem was designed by the same guy who designed the phone I have at home and also a kind of pasta... De Mita is with the Centre Left, so they have another pillar of the old regime. - You should interview him. - I'm embarrassed to. - What's next? - In Naples, Alessandra Mussolini. Have the basketball play-off rules changed this year? Come on, Nanni, concentrate. Nanni, concentrate! Today... It's mad, I just can't... All right, come on. - What films are coming out this week? - I don't know. Casino ?… - I don't know. - Savelli's in Legnano. It stinks of garlic here! What is it? Fried Brussels sprouts? What's wrong with this town? They put garlic in everything. Why all this garlic? I'm going up to ask... Duty. A duty to make this documentary. I don't want to but I must. But I don't want to. It would be so nice to finally shoot that 50s musical. The Left is all for Stalin. But there's a Trotskyite confectioner, isolated and maligned... who, only in his shop, ... among his cakes... is happy. He forgets everything and dances. In this documentary, I want to say what I think. Without, however, provoking right-wing viewers. That's not my aim. Without convincing them. I'm not trying to convince anyone. I won't pander to the Left either. But how can I say what I think in a documentary? And what do I think exactly? These are the final days of the electoral campaign. We're going around to film rallies. Our Sunday's victory must also allow the creation of guarantees and rights to freedom so that each of us may live in security in a free country without social hatred and class jealousies. On Sunday... once again... the Italian people will be fighting ... against the old parties. The Italy that works... against the Italy that talks! Yes. All right, I'll think about it. I'll ring you later. Yes. This afternoon, in two hours at the Eliseo Theatre? Listen... No, I'm coming. I promise. This time is different. Sure, I have to make a short speech. Short, please! Who'll be there? Directors, writers, actors... The usual thing. OK, I'll be there. These elections... All right, see you in a couple of hours. Why did I say yes? Why did I say yes? Why? What kind of speech can I make? Someone said that this time … we must vote for something. For an alliance, a programme, individuals. But I'd also like to vote against something. Against the Italian Right, against those who… No… Tous les discours préparés All the letters written and never sent. All the letters never sent. 1988. Letter written and never sent to the Italian Communist Party. Against the Italian Socialists. "You can't send that." " In the regions, we have to ally ourselves with them.". Spring 1993. A letter written … when I heard the Communists… had been mildly involved in a bribery scandal. Dear leaders of the PDS, Leave the party to the young ... who unlike yourselves haven't known Stalinism sectarianism and your old-style politics. At the start of the 70s, a letter to leftist movements. It went like this. The old Left, unfortunately, had the USSR as a model. The new Left, unfortunately, has Mao's China as a model. But why? Why is it so? These aren't the models ... that should inspire our country. No. All these letters never sent. One day, I'll completely lose my mind. And I'll end up in London, in that corner of Hyde Park where any nutter can say what he likes of a Sunday. I'll give my speeches at last and I'll send all the letters that I never sent. For us left-wing Italians... the model must be Emilia Romagna! The region that has … the world's best day-care centres! The best social services, the best hospitals. Pass it around! Make the content known of the letter. Circulate! A letter from 1991: Dear RAI 3... It should have been the left-wing channel. I'm not in great shape today The elections are a few days away and I'm working on my documentary. We're outside the home of Corrado Stajano. A journalist and writer who, for two years now,… has been a parliamentary senator with the Left. He has been asked to run again, but he refused. He is leaving Rome and is in the middle of packing. Now I must focus and prepare the right questions. You've been a senator for two years but you've decided not to run again? Why? Have these two years as a senator been a waste of time? Not at all, on the contrary, They were very full years. But how can we talk about this in the midst of brown tape and boxes? All right but... Come on, give us a hand. I'd like to say that... - Take these books. - Where Should I put them? - Over here. - But is This move symbolic? You're leaving the city where you planned on a political career. The city where you thought you'd count but you didn't. Oh, come on! Perhaps there's no room for men like yourself, who aren't professional politicians. There will be no room unless politics change! - All right, but don't get upset. - Take these. I wanted to say that your experience shows... - Over here? - Yes. It shows that even inside the Left tactics still have the upper hand. The most noxious form of politics. Is that what you've learned from your time in Rome? How about your relationship with the city of Rome? What was your experience of this city? What a generic question! All right... Stop a second. I'm not in very good shape today. - Are you OK? Are you? - I'm OK. - It's still weak... - Not really. It'll get stronger and more frequent. - What about The stopwatch? - Stop it. Will they put him in the nursery? - If it's still there. - What? - The nursery. - Why? - The Milk League's against it. - What's that? A group of mothers and paediatricians … in favour of breast-feeding. Just like us. We're not against it. Who should I call when we get there? - my mother. - My mother, yours, my sister... - Yours. - Serena … - Giovanna, Linda and Claudio. What do I tell them? Don't worry, stay at home. - In two hours, it'll be over. - I should be so lucky. - I'll call you in five, six or seven hours. Yes. We're in a small room. There are two other women in labour. Silvia's in a lot of pain. Not far from the delivery room. You hear these screams... Well, I think we're almost there. Everyone has to know. Spread the news! Everyone has to know. Calm down. They stopped me from putting up a manifesto. Have an epidural! They gave her an epidural, it's wonderful. Anaesthetic for the lower body. That way, from now on, she won't feel any pain. Everyone should have it! It's me again. The head's not coming. Because... I don't know why. It's 10 centimetres in diameter. Her pelvis is narrow. I don't know. The head is not on the neck of the womb. They say she'll need a Caesarean. I'll ask to be there. I hope they refuse! Bye. They agreed. I'm going. - Good luck. - Thank you. The radio was on. I focused and thought, I want to remember the song they play when Pietro's born. It'll be his life's song. A total blank, I don't remember a thing! Maybe there wasn't a radio. Maybe I imagined it. The baby's well. Silvia's well. And, above all, so am I. I'm proud of myself, I didn't faint! Fifty three and a half centimetres, maybe more. 4.2 kg. He left Leonardo standing. That's his room-mate. He was born almost at the same time, … 2.6 kg It's Marco. I spoke to Agata... I've heard the news and wanted to greet… the Lion of Monteverde's son, the cub: 4.2 kg,… including claws! This is Kim… Hello! I wanted to hear... your news... What's happening. When they're coming home... What Nanni's doing... What Pietro's doing... How Silvia is doing... Call me at home. It's Dario. I hope he's been born. I don't know anything and... So… What's happening? This afternoon, two campaigns are ending. Pietro's got lots of hair. But he weighs less today. It's physiological! The Left is at Piazza Farnese and the Right at Piazza Navona. - Do we have two crews? - Yes. - So we can film both. - Exactly. - and tomorrow? - Tomorrow … - How's Silvia? - a little tired. We won't stay long. Let's… We can film both... Tomorrow, we can check the public opinion body, … the CIRM. Piepoli will be teaching young people how to question voters to get the exit polls. - Congratulations! He's beautiful. - Silvia looks Good too. - Yes, a little tired... What about you, how do you feel? I was talking to them. avec eux. I'll call you tonight. And on Sunday we'll do interviews at the PDS HQ. We'll interview… - Video or film? - Video. Hello, Jacopo. Hello, Matilde. - How are you? - Fine. - Have you got measles? - No. - Are you sure? - Sure I'm sure. - Do you have a cold? - Are they well? - Very well! I'm worried about the baby, maybe they shouldn't go in. Are you feeling OK? Come on. Don't tire her. Don't tire Silvia, OK? It's an awakening... In the North, I remove another 15,000. That's the Northern League average. And that makes 60,000. Therefore, in order to win, you need 30,000 votes plus one. I don't understand much of this. To be honest, I don't understand a word he says. I'm at the opinion poll office. An hour ago, I was at the hospital and Pietro was feeding. Now he's asleep. It's an awakening. The Italians wake up. It's a beautiful sunny day, they're optimistic. That has no effect on 95% of the voters but there are 5% who will go from Right to Left or Left to Right. They change their vote at the last minute... and vote differently from the night before because it's sunny! It's sunny on election day. But will they go from Right to Left... or from Left ... to Right because it's sunny? We are at the headquarters of the PDS, on via delle Botteghe Oscure. In a few hours, we should be doing interviews... for my documentary. I'm going to have some hot milk with a drop of coffee. When will you be back? Can you call Alessandro? I have some questions that... It's not working. Right, I'm going to the cafe to look over my questions. The leaders will be here soon. Everyone will soon be here. But you have fifteen minutes. Start getting things ready. - Where do we interview? - On the fourth floor. Fourth floor, perfect. I'll go and gather my thoughts for a minute. Hello? Sorry I didn't call earlier but I can't get away. The milk's coming today. I understand, The milk's coming today. - What's coming? - The milk's coming today. Pietro is guzzling away, what a sight! He has to eat a lot so that he'll sleep a lot. He has to eat a lot so that he'll sleep a lot. I understand, but when are you coming over? They're waiting for your interviews. I'm coming, let me film Silvia and Pietro a bit more. We're all awaiting the Senate results.. to be confirmed by the Assembly ones. But... in the meantime... I see the Assembly results appear on the screen. We have more than a three point lead... And that too, of course... - Congratulations. - Four point two kilos! Remember? We've already talked about it. There are two voices, two holds, two contacts... The maternal role and the paternal role. Oh, how sleepy we are... You have to learn Tibetan serenity. Do you remember what Bernardo Bertolucci said? If I don't win at the Cannes Festival, it doesn't matter. I'll be at peace anyway. That's the serenity the Tibetan monks taught me. At peace, My rabbit... Are you asleep? I can't see you, hold on. Are you asleep? - I can't hold out. - Nor can I. What did the paediatrician say? To let him cry until feeding time. OK... We can always change paediatricians! Let's sit down. Let's act normal. Let's talk … talk about school Pietro's already done Primary school. Secondary school, here in Monteverde. - No, the American School. - I don't like that... Just act normal. Why did you cry out in your sleep earlier? I dreamt he was falling from the changing table. - In slow motion? - Yes, slowly. And you were powerless, in a corner? I had the same dream. What was Titti saying? It's no use trying not to make mistakes. You'll make plenty anyway. - The important thing is to know it. - and work on that. Ready? Let's go! You have to reveal yourself! You must say, "Pietro, what's wrong? Everyone's sleeping here". Without getting angry. You may think he doesn't understand - But he does. - You have to reveal yourself! - All right. Your role is more emotional than nurturing. Really? You'll teach him social skills... Your role is less ambiguous because later Silvia tells him, Have some milk. Your message is clearer. Don't cry like that! I'll buy you a scooter the minute you turn fourteen. Please, Pietro. See how much Daddy and Mommy love each other? Look. A kiss! Harmony in the home, harmony in the family, how wonderful! On your back... On your back, yes. Pietro, what do you enjoy doing most? Swimming, yes! The crawl, you love that! Remember the two different holds, Pietro. Mum's firm hold and Dad's anxious hold. Follow me with your eyes. Here I am. Muscles! To avoid the frail shoulders of Italian tennis players who always lose because of the umpire, … the wind, bad luck... It's always somebody else's fault, never theirs. At first, Nanni found it hard. He didn't understand … why his son wanted to stay with his mother instead of his father. The admirable thing about him was the process by which he tried to become an adult. That ability to stand aside, while remaining present. After all, the child's need came first. So he was learning to be less self-oriented. He started to think of the child, taking up the challenge at last of a man who has to become adult. But why should he become an adult? There's no reason. I'm a lucky boy Because I've been given a dream. I'm lucky because there's nothing I need. And when evening falls and I return to you ... What's done is done. The luck of meeting you again ... You're as pretty as the sun! You drive me crazy! How did she manage to feed me? Nemorense Park, my childhood park. I think back to when I was little. I even consider writing a poem. But, above all, I think of breastfeeding. manage to teach at school… and breastfeed me at the same time? When I was born, there was no maternity leave. - So You started teaching again in October? - On October 1st. School started on October 1st. I was born on August 19th. I was barely six weeks old. At six weeks, Pietro was feeding seven times a day. Six or seven times. Let's say I had six feedings. No, you had five feedings. What do you mean, did I decide that? No, I decided it with the paediatrician. You were healthy... and I had to go back to work. You were away four and a half hours. What about me? Sometimes, you were crying. - What? - Well, you were hungry. - Is it funny? After four hours I was hungry! - Of course. That's terrible. Perhaps I'd been crying for half an hour... - Let's hope not. - But it may have happened. It may have happened... We, the People of Padania... ...PDN stickers for the cars. A thousand symbols for the nation thought up by Bossi. A nation, he claims, free of Southern teachers... but with his own police and judges within a year. In a few days, they'll be declaring independence for Padania. Three days on the Po, with a finale in Venice. I want to go and film that. ...the final arrangements. Bossi will go down the Po by car, boat and helicopter. The Voice of Mantua has the headline: The Day of the Ayatollah. La Stampa, Bossi Baptises Padania. Il Corriere della Sera, Bossi declares: Yes, it's an illicit act'. - I wanted to show you the map. - All right. We left from Borgoforte and should be around here. I don't really feel like it... - We should follow the river... ...shooting. In order to meet… the League's flotilla before Boretto. In Boretto, we can film them landing. Perhaps the flotilla... won't notice us. Because we'll be to the side, slightly hidden. No, it's impossible! We're heading right at them... - They will see us. - They will. - In Boretto... - We'll go against them. Towards them. There, we can leave with the League's flotilla, go as far as Borgoforte... - I need a cappuccino. - No. - A macchiato... Come on! - We can send someone with a flask. Not a flask... If I go into a cafe... - After, in Borgoforte... - I can sit down at a table... Padania no longer feels Italian. Today she follows her own path. Tomorrow this river will be a highway to freedom. Tomorrow, we'll be in Venice! Here we are. Today, I'm going to shoot important things. But I'm a little embarrassed. I'd like to be able to film ... without being seen. Today I'm in shape. I can feel it. And it's important to make this documentary. I like it. Yes… Even if the musical about the confectioner... That would really be something... Did you hear that? That's Bossi talking. Get some shots of him. Hand-held camera or on a tripod? Hand-held. But when are you coming? I don't like that. Fix it on a tripod. You're filming Bossi, let's say... Not in close-up, no. In a wider shot, to show his hands. All right? We, the people of Padania, solemnly declare that … Padania is a federal republic, an independent, sovereign state. - What do we do now? - Now, be daring! - What? - Be daring! Take the camera in your hand and let's be daring stylistically. Move through the demonstrators carrying the camera, OK? Bye, see you later. Over and out! Clippings, more clippings and covers All the clippings that I've kept… just because they made me angry. Maybe I should start a new file… with covers from L'Espresso. Covers that, they claim, can increase the sales by ... about 15%. I wonder if it's true. Who knows? Brindisi, spring 1997. We're here because off this coast, three days ago, it seems that 89 Albanians died trying to reach Italy. There was an accident. An Italian navy vessel rammed the Albanian ship ... that sank. We're waiting because, apparently, despite the accident, ... in a few days another ship will arrive from Albania. Do you think things would be the same or different for you, if Italy were ruled by the Right or by the Left? That question is... What idiotic, inappropriate questions! I can't do this. And the fact that in the last few days not a single left-wing leader has come to Puglia is symptomatic of their political absence. But, above all, of their human absence! They couldn't care less. I remember, in the 70s, in Rome, young Communists would spend their afternoons watching Happy Days on TV. I don't see any relation. That's their political, cultural and moral training. That's got nothing to do with it! All right, it hasn't... It hasn't... but it has. Will you stay in Italy? I don't think I'll ever go back to Albania because I'm 40 and so... If I have to earn something here... 400 or 500,000 lira a month... That's not enough to start again in Albania. When's your baby due? - It's in the mother's stomach. - When is it due? July or August, I think. Who did you come with? My brother and two children. What are you going to do? I don't know. Several months have passed since that trip to the South. I haven't shot anything since. I haven't even edited my documentary on Italy. All the material is there, unused, and I'm left with a lot of confusion. A biker. An athlete. A cat. A postman! A kind of hat... Wait, an object. I'm walking down the street... - Roller-skates. - The air is polluted. No, I wasn't miming. I'm just moving because I'm a nervous person. - Come on! - All right. - OK, two words... - Only a little time left! That's intimidation! I'm walking and, passing by... Skateboards! - Cars. - a car exhaust. - and then... - Time's up! - So what was it? - a catalytic converter. I wasn't able to finish the story... This is a metre. One hundred centimetres. - Today's your birthday. Many happy returns. - Thank you. You haven't made a film in a while. Important things have happened. Pietro was born... Yes, but you have to get on with it. How long do you want to live? - Seventy, seventy-five... - Eighty! Right, I'll take off twenty. Here's eighty. You've just turned forty-four so… we bring it all the way down... Here, look: This is what's left. Happy birthday anyway! What? Why eighty? What an idiot! It makes no sense... I wanted to say ninety-five! He caught me off guard. Eighty minus forty-four… Eighty minus forty-four… I have to film... what I like Not ugly things. Fashion designers exhibit their clothes in a museum in Florence... Why should I film that? A crazy woman displays... her plastic surgery operations in a museum… Who cares? The clippings I've collected over more than twenty years, just because they made me angry… I'm throwing them all away! I'll go looking for my childhood places. The park. The pool where I learned to swim... It doesn't do much for me. My primary school... nothing at all. It doesn't make me feel like crying or writing a bad poem. I pluck up some courage and finally put on the winter cape that I had never dared to wear! Action! Action! Action! Scene 1. vt
