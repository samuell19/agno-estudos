The Story of Little Frick and his Fiddle Once upon a time there was an old cottage high up in the mountains. There lived a poor crofter and his wife. They had one son. His name was Frick. Slight and frail he was, so they called him Little Frick. Well, Little Frick, here at home there's little to eat and drink, - - so you should seek employment. I've seen the Beadle. He's just sacked his farm hand. You can take his place, he said, if you're willing to work for food. - You won't get much in wages. - But at least you'll be fed every day. That's how Little Frick came to work on the Beadle's farm. The poor lad had to work hard for his supper - - from early morning till late at night. Our Beadle is a heartless man. He drives me on as hard he can. I pump the water up on his land. Filling pail by pail and pan by pan. This farm is run by my decree. And woe the one who crosses me. There's far too much for me to do. My bones, they ache, my muscles too. I'm chopping wood, and when I'm through - - it's time for me to start anew. If I catch him lazing time away. So help me, I'll make him pay! All winter long I work the saw. I work and work my fingers raw. I need to rest my aching paw. Until my hands and fingers thaw. I'll have no lazy shirking here. You pull your weight and do your share. After toiling for the Beadle for three long years, he told his master - - that he wanted to see the world. And didn't he deserve some payment? Oh well, I suppose it's fair that you should get paid. I will pay you one guinea for each year. That makes two... No, that makes an even three guineas for three years. That's a lot of money, but don't you think I deserve a little more? More? You're getting more than you deserve already! But what about money for clothes? The ones I wore when I came are all worn out, and I haven't got any new. You've gotten what we agreed. I'll have nothing more to do with you! You may go and pack some food for the road. But that's all you will get! He just had to make do with the Beadle's offer. He was a happy young lad all the same. And so he went off to see the world. I was with the Beadle for three long years. Angry, grumpy, merciless and cruel. Hungry and tired and often in tears. Hi there, ho there, such a greedy fool. Toiling and slaving from morning 'til late. Angry, grumpy, merciless and cruel. Three shiny guineas were all I did rate. Hi there, ho there, such a greedy fool. Ragged and dirty I was all the while. - Angry. - Grumpy. Merciless and cruel. But now I will dress in a gentleman's style. Hi there. Ho there. Such a greedy fool. Hello, hello, my boy. No, no, don't be afraid of me. I'm just asking for a guinea. I only have three, and I'm going to buy some clothes. It's worse for me than for you. I have no money, and I'm more ragged. - Well, you'd better have this, then. - Thank you very much, my boy. Your welcome, sir! I had three guineas, but now I have two. I'm going to town to buy new shoes. A hat and some trousers. A lamb or a cow, maybe even a horse. Faderee, faderah, faderoollan. Hello, hello, my boy! No, don't be afraid of me. I'm just asking for a guinea. I only have two guineas, and I'm going to buy some clothes. - If only I had met you earlier. - It's worse for me than for you. I have no money and a bigger body and less to wear. Oh well, you'd better have this, then. Oh, thank you! And bless you for your kindness. Your welcome. I'm down to my last coin. Perhaps it can still buy me some clothes. I can't afford either fiddle or gun. Not much to show for the work I have done. Hello, hello, my boy! You're so big and tall! Don't be afraid of me! I'm just a pauper, asking for a guinea. I only have one guinea left - - and I'm going to town to buy some clothes! If only I had met you earlier! But I have no money and a bigger body and less to wear, - - so it's worse for me than for you! Oh well, you'd better have this last one, then! Now they all got a guinea and I have none. Thank you very much! You see, you've given them all to me! I've just disguised myself each time, so you wouldn't recognize me! But because you have such a generous heart, - - and have given away all you had, I will grant you a wish for each guinea! That's really something! I've always wanted to see people happy! So I wish for a fiddle that makes all living creatures dance. Your wish is granted, but that was a feeble wish. Try something better for the second. Then I wish for a gun that will hit all I aim for, no matter how far away! It is granted but that was a feeble wish, also. Wish for something better for the last guinea. In that case then, I wish that no one will refuse me the first I ask for. Yes, that's more like it! That wasn't such a feeble wish. Tomorrow when you wake up, all your wishes will come true! Good night! And sleep tight! Good night to you! While Little Frick was fast asleep, something strange occurred. Suddenly the fiddle and the gun appeared. His wishes had been granted. You saw him surrender his every last cent. - On people in need. - All guineas were spent. Our Little Frick is such a good hearted boy. Been given three wishes we hope he'll enjoy. Not one single penny is left to my name. Fiddle and gun I have, just the same. The first I ask will be given to me. None can refuse, all will have to agree. Little Frick was a happy young lad. Now he had both a fiddle and a gun. He wandered into a beautifully kept farmyard. He wanted to see if no one could refuse him the first thing he asked for. - We'll have no tramps around here. - Oh no, It's just Little Frick. I just want to ask if you could give me some clothes? - I'm so awfully ragged. - Clothes? Should I give you new clothes? I've never heard anything like it! Your ragged, alright, but... Well, you'd better come in, and we'll see. Thank you kindly. I asked for some clothes and she could not refuse. So now I am wearing new socks and new shoes. A hat, a shirt and trousers, of course. I'm only lacking a proud stately horse. One day Little Frick came to a very large estate. He decided to try his luck. Good day, farmer. That's a mighty fine horse you have got there. Good day to you. Yes, I have twenty more horses, but this one is the best. Since you have so many, can you'll give me this? Give away my best stallion to one like you? I'm not that stupid. Stupid... uh... Did you say "horse"? Well, since you ask, you can have it! Little Frick was happy. For now he had a fiddle, a gun, - - clothes and a horse. People would give him everything he wanted. We'll gallop together all through the day. - Find me a bridle and bit on the way. - We'll travel around to each town. You should get a carriage with wheels that go 'round. I have a fiddle, a gun and a horse. Proper equipment you'll get me, of course. - Riding my carriage I am quite the man. - Is this a carriage? I don't think so. - Around like the gentry we'll ride. - If we meet a parson we'll hide. If only the Beadle could see me and you. Take care what you wish for in case it comes true. - Halt! - Whoa! Whoa, I said! - Hello, Master. - Good day. Am I your master? Yes, I served you for three years. You've come a long way! - How did you become such a man? - Wouldn't you like to know? Are you so frivolous that you have a fiddle also? Yes, I love to make people dance. But the best thing I've got is my gun. It will hit anything I aim for. How much do you bet I can hit that rooster on the rooftop way over? I'll bet my entire estate that you'll never do that. And the hundred silver coins in my bag. And I'll even put it back up, too! But if you miss, both your horse and your carriage shall be mine. Fair enough! You're on! Well, I don't believe it! Hand over the bag, Beadle. For 100 coins you did wager with me, that the rooster would be there to see. Hurry and put it back where it belongs. And dance as I fiddle my songs. The one who laughs last is the one who laughs best! - Grumpy Beadle, you need to dance. - Until you faint and fall in a trance. You shall become just as tattered as me. During my three years before I was free. Little Frick drove off. And the Beadle had to dance around in the shrubbery. For no one could stop dancing when Little Frick played his fiddle. He took a room at an inn. He started playing, - - and everyone was compelled to dance. He lived happily and well. He knew no sorrow - - because no one could refuse him the first thing he asked for. But the Beadle went to the sheriff to make a complaint about Little Frick. First he attacked me, and then he robbed me. And finally the rascal nearly killed me. He should hang for this! I suppose there's nothing else for it. If you think what I'm thinking, we'll go get him tonight when he's asleep. In the name of the law, you're under arrest! You are sentenced to hang at dawn. Things looked bleak for Little Frick. Following morning, he was taken to the gallows, where a crowd had gathered. Quiet! It is hereby decreed that Little Frick has assaulted, - - plundered, robbed, and by other means harmed our dear Beadle. Yes, even nearly causing his death, which would have been a great shame. That our Beadle shall have full restitution, - - we sentence Little Frick to death by hanging! I suppose it can't be helped. It's customary to be granted a final wish. I'd really like to play a song on my fiddle before you hang me! For goodness' sake, you mustn't let him play a note, or we're all done for! It would be a shame to refuse him his last request in this world. Last request? Oh well, let him have his request. But no shenanigans! Then tie me to that birch tree. Yes, do that and I'll play a tune you'll never forget! As quick as a wink, he began to fiddle, - - and everyone started dancing, whether they wanted to or not. The sorriest sight was the Beadle tied to the birch tree! The branches tickled him so, that he nearly died laughing. No one had time to think about hanging Little Frick. He wandered off with his gun and his fiddle. Wherever he went for the rest of his days, - - for no one could refuse him the first thing he asked for.
