- Damn it, Eric. - I got the slippery little bastard. - That was my first clean shot all week. - Relax, little brother. I got us dinner. - Your dinner, not mine. I'm not eating snake. - Come on. Hey, don't be such a little bitch, Donnie. Guess I'll just meet you back at the car, then. Good talk, good talk. - Yeah, their insides were torn right the fuck out. Guts everywhere. - How many of these they find? - 20, 50, maybe, I don't know. The claw marks on their hides were something they'd never seen. - Your friend is full of shit. - Fuck you! Weirdest part, some of these cows were wrapped in this sticky shit. Like a god damn cocoon. - Baru! - What the fuck did you just say to me, old man? - That's what they call it, a Baru. Flesh-eating demon. - Flesh eating demon. So tell me, old man, what's this Baru want? - Are you okay, man? - He said, "Doctor, doctor, my wife, she's dead!" Doctor said, "What the hell happened to her? She choked! - Oh, you are a very sick man. You know that, right? - Oh come on, that's fucking funny. Oh... Ah, guess who just floated in from planet weirdo. - Come on, man. Take it easy. He lost his brother. How would you feel? - Jag. - Make yourself at home. - So I was doing some digging. - Donnie, what the? - This thing, this Baru, as the old man called it, turns out this thing's been around for centuries. And not just here in Nevada. In fact, it was the government that brought it here in the first place. Conducting tests on aggravating them. And the fucking old man was right. This thing ain't some kind of animal, it's a fucking monster. I seen it with my own god damn eyes, Jag. It almost killed me. - Nut bag. - I'm not fucking crazy. Eric didn't just get lost out there. He got taken by this thing, this fucking creature. I got proof, look. - Here we go, boys. - Right... - Rare, and medium well. - Thank you. - Anything for you, hon? - No, our resident head case is leaving. - Got it, right here, look. Eric would have been right over here, after we separated, meaning that- - Donnie. You gotta stop with these god damn wild witch hunt conspiracies of yours, man. Eric is gone. There's nothing you can do about it. - I'm not crazy. - Eric was my friend, you know that. But he went down the wrong path. That's all this is. Once an addict, always an addict. And you gotta stop letting his shit bring you down, too. You've lost enough already. - This isn't him disappearing to get high, Jag. - Donnie! Just, just go, man. Just go. - Bye bye. - Just go. - Geeze. - Why do you always gotta do that? - Do what? - Like you don't know. Come on, man. - Eric, open up. Come on, I know you're in there. Open the god damn door. - Hey, Donnie. Eric's not here right now. You have to come back later. - Out. - Fuck you, Donnie. - Hey. What the fuck? Hey, where are you going, baby? Oh, come on... Go away. It's too fucking early. - Get up. Eric. - What? What? What the fuck is so god damn important that you have to be here? - Dad's dead. Come on, Eric. Where the fuck are you? - So a man turned to him and he said, Sir, do dead men bleed? No, of course not. Dead man do not bleed. But, let me run a little experiment. I have this needle. Show me your finger. Well, the man convinced he is indeed already dead, obliges, and holds out his finger. The doctor pricks it. And blood bursts out. But we were talking about phenomena that are beyond normal, right? Was the patient now convinced that he was indeed alive? - Of course not. The patient was mad to begin with. He probably came up with another delusional point that he was still a dead man walking. - Okay, that's one strong possibility, but remember, I said beyond normal. We have to open our minds past society's normal view of reality. I mean, why must this man be mad? Simply because he speaks in ways that- - Should we do it? - We deem weird? 1992 Oregon. This was a scene that nurses found minutes later. The scene of a lunatic turned killer, or was it something else at work? Most of the blood you see spattered was the doctor's, but not all of it. There was another DNA strand in the final report. But it was not the patient's blood, or any of the orderlies. There was no match. And scientists found something quite off about the sample that they tested. The results were inconclusive, and they chalked it up to a corrupted sample. Any theories? - Well, what happened to the patient? Didn't they even find him? - I remember reading about this case. The patient's body was never found, and his records just disappeared. - Of course, you already read about it. - I call bullshit. I'm sorry, Professor, but I'm sure this is purely PR related, to minimize the fallout of a mental patient murder. - Or his records really were destroyed, because they proved he was actually dead. - Okay. - Professor, what if somehow his body remained in tact after his death, but without a soul, mentally he went insane. I mean, sure, the doctor's disbelief probably pushed him over the edge, but maybe it wasn't his fault. - Right, so he was a fucking zombie. Nice theory, Morgan. - Fuck you, Rachel. - Alright hey hey hey hey. Alright, enough, come on. Really? Your assignment is do more digging, people. Pay attention especially to the DNA data. There's a lot more to this one. We will explore it further next week. - Come on, Professor. You don't need any of us to research the correlations. Just give it to Morgan. She'll do all the work. Some of us actually have lives. Yeah, get out, out. I've had enough of you for one day. - It's right here. It's high ground, and completely dry up there. Satellite images hide it, and there's a fence line, keeps everyone out. Now records indicate it's an old mining facility, but there are hordes of theorists online, swears it's government. This creature managed to escape after God knows how many years of being locked up. What's the first thing it would do? - Well, like any living creature, it would seek nourishment. - Exactly. Water. That's where I first found the blood trail. This creek just happened to be the closest significant water source to the facility. And the cave makes sense to cover from the hot temperatures. Look, everybody thinks Eric just fell back to drugs. That's not it. I mean, I get it, he had a problem. But he would've contacted me, shown up somewhere, anywhere. Search and rescue scanned miles and miles of surrounding area and never found his body. My attack and his disappearance can't be just a coincidence. - Donnie. - I'm not fucking crazy. I know how it sounds, but I know what I fucking saw there. - Donnie, relax. I believe you. You're definitely right about one thing. That facility, the government. They're known for obscure experiments. - How can you be sure? - Because I've been there. Listen, I just need you to be patient for right now, okay? There's a couple leads that I'm working on. Alright? - Okay. - I will call you when I know more. - Come on, let's do it. - I can't believe we're actually doing this. - Ooh, it's so creepy out here. - Oh shut up, Mary. Grow some balls, for fuck's sake. - Hey ladies, what do you say? Nobody's around. No stupid boys, girl's night. - I don't know if we should. - Oh my god, you're crazy. Woo! - Yes. - Well? - Come on. - There's something out there, though. I don't think this is such a good idea. Maybe we should just go. - Shut up, Mary. Now let's see those titties! - Titties, titties, titties! - Okay, fine. - Woo! - Ow! - Come on, show me them! Ow! Come on, let's see 'em. - Oh wow. - Shut up. You guys are such bi- - Check this out, bro. What the fuck is that? - Hello? - Donnie, it's Charles. I've got something for you, but you're gonna have to move fast. - Okay. - Hey. - What the fuck? - I'm one of Professor Ridley's students. - Uh yeah, what the hell are you doing here? - Okay, I know this is going to sound crazy, but I have to come with you. I overheard you and the Professor talking on the phone about the attack. - Look, I appreciate your tenacity, but I really need to go. - No, come on, look. I promise I'm not gonna slow you down. I can help you. I'm really good at this stuff. Please. I'm not gonna take no for an answer. - Fine. I think it's over here. - How'd the Professor find out about this? - I don't know. And he said the cops can show up anytime, so let's get moving. - You've been here? - Yeah, my dad was big outdoorsy type. He was always dragging me and Eric to these random spots. - That's fun. My parents are more of the shut-in type. Or, they were, I should say. - I think I might have preferred that. - Oh my god. Fuck! You know what, I think I'm gonna be sick. Oh fuck. - Jesus. You know, when I was attacked, there were two things that stood out to me more than anything. This bluish green shit, it was like goo. I think it was the creature's blood, or something. But equally weird was this sticky web substance. I found a deer corpse halfway wrapped up in it. But I don't think the creature was finished. It almost looked like it was making a- - A cocoon? - Yeah, exactly. - You're gonna want to come see this. - Fuck, that's it. Hey, don't touch that shit. We don't know what's in there. Plus, we're not even supposed to be here, remember? - Okay, geeze. Hey, there are two more sets of clothes over here. - So where's the third girl? - I think the bigger question is what the hell happened here? - Well, we got two girls stripped down, so they must have been in the water. Out headless friend here looks like she was killed before she got a chance to join them. - Right, so the two girls try to make a run for it that way, and then this girl got caught, and put in a freaking cocoon. - So I guess the third girl's that way? - Jesus. What, did she fucking get eaten? - Who the hell would eat one and wrap the other? - She must have had something that the other girls didn't. Look, I don't know. I still think we need to take a closer look at that cocoon shit. - Shit, we need to go. - Now? - Yeah, come on. Grab some of that blue shit, and let's get the fuck out of here. Fuck. - You know that guy? - Yeah, and he knows me, too. - Phenomenal. - What is it? - It's alive. Quite literally, too. The sample you took seems to have some kind of a DNA strand in it, but the strand is more like a parasite. Like it's searching for something. - Shit, I can't tell. - Alright, just look carefully. You have to look around the blood cells. Those are human mixed in from the victim, when the sample was gathered, it seems. - What? I see them. Jesus. They seem agitated. Are they supposed to be swirling in the blood like that? - It's trying to bond with the blood. Don't you know what this means? I know this. I know I've seen this before. - It means that the creature's natural instinct is to find a human host. - Like for breeding. - No, no not for breeding. For survival. It seems that it needs a human host to overcome something. I don't know what. - Like our atmosphere? - Yeah. Actually, exactly like our atmosphere. Which means this isn't some forsaken creature, you guys. This is from another fucking planet. - Oh, I'd say it's a little bit more of both. - Donnie, are you okay? - That's it. That's the fucking creature that attacked me. - That's the Barushakana Razalla. Legend tells of its appearance. It's said to rise from the depths of hell during a solar eclipse. - Jesus, Charles, this isn't a fucking werewolf hunt in a scary movie, fuck! - Jesus Christ, Donnie. Come on, don't you- You said so yourself. This creature is different. Like it's some kind of a monster. - Yeah, but I don't think digging through a book of fairy tales is the answer either. - Okay Donnie, stop. - Okay look, I get it. This is a lot to take in. And it's a lot easier to believe in these things when it's only in your mind. But when it not only becomes reality, but conflict, that's when it gets confusing. This, this is not just a book of made-up stories. This is a diary. It's a diary of occurrences over time. Of things that can't be explained. At least not to someone with a closed mind. - Okay. - Okay. Look, it's getting late. It's been a long night. I want you to get some rest. Morgan and I will run some more tests. We'll get some more specifics on exactly how and why this thing is trying to attach itself to humans. - I'm fine, I'm fine, I can help. - I want you to get some rest. You're only slowing us down. Morgan. - Yeah. - Spin these down. - Sure. - It's the Barushakana Razalla. Legend tells of its appearance. It's said to rise from the depths of hell during a solar eclipse. - Barushakana, Barushakana. - Baru! That's what they call it, a Baru! Flesh-eating demon. - Shit. - Jerry's Desert Quenchers, this is Jerry. - Yeah, I'm looking for a patron of yours, an old man. - Ha, you're gonna have to be a little more specific than that, kid. My crowd isn't exactly young and fresh. - Yeah. Look, I'm pretty sure he's a regular of yours. Crazy guy, tells lots of outlandish stories. Look, I know I'm being vague, but I was in there a few months ago. The guy was telling everybody about this fucking Baru thing. - You're that fella that passed out in here, aren't you? - Yeah, but I was just- - Sorry, kid. Can't help you. Crazy man looking for a crazy man. - Wait, wait, wait, hey. - Good luck with that. - Hello, hello? Fuck! What the fuck! Fuck! Have you been here all night? - Yep. Donnie, you're never gonna believe what we found. Look at this. What the hell happened to you? - Nothing, just show me what you found. - Okay... Okay, here. So we know the creature's blood was attempting to bond with the human DNA, right? Look at this. It's not just bonding. It's manipulating the host. Controlling it, not just killing it. - So the host blood is surviving the attack. - Yes and no. I mean, most of its properties remain, but for the most part, the human DNA is barely existent. It's there, just dormant. - So the process can be reversed? - What do you mean? - If the creature's taking a host, a human host, that process can be reversed, right? The creature be removed, and the human survive? - You don't think your brother- - I don't know what to think anymore. Where's the Professor? - He took off. In a real hurry, actually. - Why? - I don't know. We found this, he found something else in his book, and then just took off. You know, to be honest, it's starting to sound a little crazy. - What did he find? - He didn't say. He just told me to tell you to sit tight, and don't do anything until he gets back. Who is it? - The Detective that saw us leaving the hot springs? - Oh geeze, do not answer that. - Fuck. Yeah? - Hey. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I think I've found something. - Where are you? - I'm out by the old shack off 50. You remember it? - Yeah, of course. But what are you doing out there? - I'm beginning to think, shit. Well, that maybe you're not so crazy after all. Just get out here, will you? - Yeah, of course, right away. - Hey, where the hell are you going? Donnie! - It's the strangest thing I ever seen, Donnie. One girl was wrapped in some sticky web shit. A god damn cocoon. Pathologists are still trying to get her out of it so we can do the examination on her. But you already knew that, didn't you? Come on, now. I passed you not five miles from the crime scene. Jesus, Donnie, what are you getting yourself into? If I didn't know you, you'd be at the top of the suspect list. Fuck, man. How'd you know about the three girls before we did? Come on, Donnie, throw me a fucking bone here. - Hey. I went to you for help. Told you all about this. And your fucking sleazebag partner spit in my face. - I get it. I really do. But you gotta understand that it's a little hard to believe, right? And I'm here now, aren't I? - Yeah, you are. What are we doing out here, anyway? I canvased the entire area. You don't think the old shack wasn't the first place I looked? - Yeah, but you only know it as the hunting stop. Back in the day, Eric and I used to sneak out here on weekends. Bring a few girls, bring a few beers. You know. - Yeah. I remember you two together. - Fuck, that was forever ago. Long before Eric went over the deep end. - Cool, cool! - God damn it, Eric. Stat out of the- Ow... Shit. Oh, Donnie, help me out with this pack, would you? - Sure thing. - Let me sit down first. Hand me my pills out of there, would you? That brother of yours ain't scared of anything. - Yeah, but he's sure a dumbass. - You watch your fucking mouth. Can I get a cigarette too, please? Come here a sec. Donnie, you are the smart one. That means you gotta look after him. 'Cause he's family. You know, he's blood, and that's forever. So you gotta watch his back, no matter how much of a dumbass he is. No matter what. - No matter what. - That's a good boy. Now go get him out of there before he kills himself. - Eric! - If Eric wanted to use, I figured this is a close enough place to keep a stash. I know you'd have never let him do that, so. He always kept a decent size supply up here, just in case. It's that emergency shit right there. But he'd have never opened this unless he was completely desperate. - He did say he hadn't used for a couple weeks. - You know, for Eric, I'd say that's pretty desperate. - I was being an ass to him. I was just so fucking frustrated with him. We should've never separated in the first place. This doesn't change anything, though, Jag. Even if he did come out here to use, he would've showed up. That fucking creature had to have found him, too. That's the only explanation. You realize that, right? - I didn't want to. But, then I found something. Just right down there. - I'm gonna kill this fucking monster. And rip its fucking head off. - He was in there. Wasn't he? So where is he now? - Who the fuck is this? - Your kitchen is fucking disgusting. - Yeah, sorry. - Your Detective friend, again? - Yeah. - Now, are you sure you don't want to bring him in on this? It seems like he wants to help. - I know. It's just, I feel like I'm going completely insane. - Well, I think that happened months ago. It doesn't make any of this less real. - I wasn't gonna tell you about this, mostly because I didn't believe myself. But last night, after I left the lab, something happened. - I assumed so. You looked like shit this morning. - That creature, or some creature, attacked me. - Where? - I think it hitched a ride back with us from the hot springs. I was driving out, following a lead, fucker bursts out of the trunk, ran me off the damn road. - Oh my god. - It was different, though. It wasn't how I remembered it from before. - Different. So you think there's more than the one that first attacked you? You don't think that Eric... - I don't know. But its eyes, for just a second, I swear I saw Eric in there. Probably just false hope, though. - Oh my god. Oh my god, that's what the cocoons are for. They're converting humans into its kind. - Jesus, do you really think that's possible? - Yeah, the way those samples were bonding. The empty cocoon by your brother's supplies. I'd say it's more than possible. - Fuck. I shot him. What do we do now? - I don't know. God, I wish the Professor was here. He'd probably have some idea of what to do. I mean, I don't even know where to begin to look. It's not like they have some lair. - The girl. - What? - One of the girls at the hot springs. She was wrapped in a cocoon, too. Jag said the pathologist hasn't even been able to open it without damaging the remains. - Okay, okay. So if we can just take a look at the body, then we would at least be able to prove our theory. - So the morgue, then? - Yeah? - No, I'm not waiting any longer for 'em. The body will be fine. It's not like it's going anywhere. They even have me keeping it in the old basement. I know. - It's not time, it's not time. - I've never seen anything like it, either. - It's not time. - Let's go, let's go. - Bob told me the FBI- - Okay come on, come. - Would be here in the morning with a specialist to see for themselves. Yeah, I don't think they really believe us. Hell, I wouldn't believe us. - I bet that's her. Okay... Well, looks like we made it in time. - Oh my god! - Fuck! - She's fucking alive in there. Or something is. What the hell do we do? - I don't fucking know! - Hey! - Donnie! What is happening? - Freeze! Shit! - Fuck! - What the fuck? - You're fucked. - What the fuck? Jesus Christ. I fucking knew her. - What? - She's in the Professor's class with me. Or was. Oh my god. Her name's Rachel. - Jag called. He said he's got new info on the Professor. He wants to meet right now. - Okay. Yeah, let me put some clothes on first. - Do you trust him? - Who? - Professor Ridley. Well? - I guess. I mean, I'm sure he's got an explanation. What the fuck? Ow, ah... - Come on, hurry up. We gotta get out there. - Yeah, okay. - She attacked us. It was vicious. She wasn't like the creatures that attacked me from before, though. She looked more... Infected. Her body seemed to be disintegrating. After McElroy, or after she got him, she just, fell apart? - What the hell was he doing there, anyway? - He was keeping watch over the body, at least until the FBI showed up. - Yeah well, they did. And he didn't even seem that surprised by the sight of her. I don't think it's the first time he'd seen that. - Look, I don't think we need to start going down that path. At least, not just yet. And while you two were breaking and entering, and I was coming up with nothing, I did a little bit more checking. Now, you mentioned this Professor Ridley was helping you with this case. - Yeah, so what? - Well, you don't find it a little weird that he was interested in taking your case, Donnie? I mean, I know he teaches this stuff. But, honestly, would you believe anyone that came in spewing some monster bullshit? Even a guy like that. And those girls? Those girls were in his class, and he knew that they were dead, long before the police did. It's just way too many coincidences. And to top it off, he skips town for what, more than a week. It's a little interesting, don't you think? - Yeah, well, yeah. I'd be lying if I didn't say I wasn't getting a little worried, but, he didn't have any tie into this shit. I found him, not the other way around. - No, you didn't find him. - What are you talking about? Of course I did. - No, no Professor Ridley had me look you up weeks before you came in. - Well, I needed to do something, and apparently it's a good thing I did. Charles Ridley, also known as Frank Rankroft. Now, apparently Mr. Rankroft has quite a buried past. And I'm sure I'm just scratching the surface of it. There is no Charles Ridley. It's all a fake. It's a good fake, but it's all bullshit. - What happened to him, then? Why the new identity? - I could lose my job on this shit, but, you know that base you told me about? Yeah, well that shit is real. And they're doing all kinds of experiments, and some insanely classified shit. Rankroft worked there. He was a researcher there. And then there was some kind of incident. - Fuck, Jag. How the hell did you get this? - Don't even ask. - The guy has an experiment go horribly wrong, goes insane, his staff gets hurt, and then just disappears for the next 30 years? - And then what? Shows up as a community college professor? What's the point? - I don't know, but it's a miracle I got this much. - What do we do now? - I'm gonna keep digging. I'm gonna keep checking things out. And you two are not gonna do anything stupid. For god's sake, just keep this to yourself. Some people can be more dangerous than these damn creatures. You hear me? Hey. Hey man, you following me? Hey! Hey, hold it! Come on out! What the fuck! Eric! Eric, is that you? Come on man, this isn't you. Come on. Let me help you. I want to help you! Come on, Donnie is right outside, too. We can help you. Don't make me do this. Eric! - Help me. - Okay. Looks like he hasn't been back in a while. - So what was it you did for the Professor? - Nothing official, actually. Just helped him prep research papers and reports. - Well, he must have trusted you enough to give you a key to his office, at least. - I guess so. I mean, he did always seem like a mentor. You know, growing up, going form foster home to foster home, didn't really have anyone. I really enjoyed working with him. God, the way he looked at things, Donnie, honestly, it was fascinating. I wanted to understand him more. - Do you still? - That is a good question. I don't know. Hey. Pick a hand. Come on, pick a hand. Oh, nice job. - What the hell? - Oh my god, is that your brother? - He went back to school? - Yeah, you didn't know? - Look, even my brother, it was impossible to take him seriously. I mean, after my dad died, he said he was trying to get himself back together, get his life cleaned up. - Yeah, he took Professor Ridley's class last year. Why the hell was he watching him so closely? He wasn't just testing Eric. He was testing all of his students. Even me. - What the hell does that mean? Jag, where the hell are you? We've been trying to reach you all day. Call me, we've found something. - Still nothing? Alright, well I mean, what do we have? What do we know? - Well, we know the Professor was testing his students. We know there was something specifically about Eric that stood out to him. - Right. We know that the creature is trying to bond with humans. Take the girl from the hot springs, for example. She practically disintegrated right in front of us. Which means not everyone's compatible with this thing. Maybe that's what they're trying to test. - So if the Professor chose Eric, do you think he actually could have led this thing to him? - I mean, you heard what Jag said. How else would he have found out about the girls first? Now we have proof that he's following Eric. - Holy fuck. He's actually working with this thing, somehow. You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine! Jesus. Another? - Yeah, sure. This is stupid. You know that, right? - Oh come on, Donnie. It's legit, I swear. With Jag taking forever to get back to us, we have to do something. - Morgan? - Doctor! Thank you so much for seeing us. - Anything for you, girl. So you must be the infamous Donnie Roberts, then. It's okay. You can trust me. Morgan filled me in on everything. - How does all this work, then? - It's easy, just lay back right there. You already drank my special concoctions. - Wait, what? - It's fine. - So lay back. Listen to my voice. Donnie, do you know where you are? - I'm in the desert. - Good, good. And what do you see? - I see a cave. The cave where I was attacked. - Perfect. I want you to enter the cave. - It's dark. I see the deer in its cocoon. The blue goo. It's everywhere. Donnie, what is it? What's going on? - Something's here. - Stay calm. You're in my office still. Just tell me what you see. - Its skin's pale green. It's arms are sharp. Its eyes are- - Stay with me. Stay with me, Donnie. - Its eyes are black. It's just darkness. - And what's going on? - It hit me. I hit my head. I feel so dizzy. - No, you're not. Just focus. Look back at the creature. What do you see? - There's a bright light. I can't see anything. - Come on, Donnie, focus. - Somebody's here. - Who, who's there? - The light, it's just. There's a flare. The light was just a flare. - But who is there? - Eric. Eric, no! Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric! - It's okay. It's okay, just breathe. Just breathe for me. - The light. It wasn't from the creature, it was Eric. He found me. He saved me. He must have distracted the Baru. - Come get me, you son of a bitch! - It chased after him, but Eric knows that area better than anybody, even my dad. He must have hid out in the old shack. In his state of fear, he couldn't help but turn back to his vices. He must have tried to find a new hiding place. He didn't want to stay in one place for too long. So he, waterfall. That's where. That's where it found him. That's where it must have. - Donnie, it's okay. You don't have to. - We have to find him. We have to save him. - Alright, we're in. - Shit, you're good. - Yeah, I just hope we're not being traced. Otherwise, we're fucked. - Come on, he's gotta have something. Something he didn't tell us before. - Who the fuck is this guy? It's hard to even believe. - Look, there. Well, it's something. Morgan. Morgan, Morgan, are you alright? - I said I'm fine! - Morgan. Morgan, come on. Why don't you lie down? Did you get hurt? - I'm fine. It's just a scratch. No... - Miss Lockley. Miss Lockley. Miss Lockley. Please, I just need to talk to you. Just for a sec. - Look. Like I told you on the phone, I know nothing about Frank, or any of the work that he was doing. - That both of you were doing. I know you were at the facility with him. - I can't. - I just need to know what happened. What you were working on. And then I promise I'll never bother you again. - They will kill me. Just go away! - Please! I just need to find my brother! This fucking thing, it took him. - What thing? - It's like this creature, this alien. They call it the Barushakana. - I'm... I'm so sorry. I can't help you. If it took your brother, it's too late. Unless... - Unless what? - Unless your brother was a match. But, that would be impossible. I gotta go. - No, please. - Just, just make sure you stay the hell away from Frank Rankroft. He is dangerous. I really am truly sorry. - No, wait! No! Wait! - Mr. Roberts. - Fuck, Jesus, Charles. - How nice to see you again. - You almost gave me a heart attack. Where the hell have you been? - Oh, here and there. But you've been very busy. Did you have a nice little chat with Linda over there? - Charles, I- - Just want to understand. No, I know, I get it. And I promise you, I will explain everything to you very, very soon, but we don't have time right now, so I need for you to drive. - Oh, come on. You disappeared for weeks. You gotta give me something here. - I know where Eric is. Shall we go see him? This is it. Turn here. - Where the hell are we? - This, Donnie, this is why we're here. Why you're here. - Eric? What the fuck did you do? Answer me! - It came here centuries ago. We have no idea from where. Overseas, space, hell, itself. We don't know. I was working in a very special division of the government when it was first introduced to our lab. It stood taller, wider, and grizzlier than your brother here. He's less human. More... Beast. We ran tests on him. Studied him for years. Many of his internal organs have been damaged, making reproduction impossible, as was far as we knew. But, there were so many pieces of his genetic structure that we didn't understand. And we believed that he was seeking the host body in order to continue the existence of its species. I mean, it left a wake of mutilated bodies in its path before we trapped it. I mean, there were, oh there were cattle. There were humans, there were cats, there were dogs and birds, you name it. We theorized that the creature needed a very specific DNA match. In order for its new host to survive, this special metamorphosis process. We tried hundreds. Maybe even thousands of different genetic structures, but nothing took. - What the hell do you mean you tried? You're helping this thing, fucking feeding it? - You don't understand, Donnie. You don't under-fucking-stand! We had to, we had to know. We had never seen anything like this before. If this creature had the ability to convert species, to reproduce in this way, it would be beyond. It would be beyond remarkable. We had no idea how much longer the creature would be able to survive without finding its perfectly matched host. Unfortunately, there was an incident. And it escaped. When the government found out, boy, they came in, and they found everything. They found the tests that we had run, the humans that we had- I lost everything! The creature was out there, alone, and dying. I couldn't let that happen. My position at the college. Oh, that was a perfect cover for me to start my research again. I mean, I didn't have all my old data. I didn't have all of it, but I had some. I had enough, I had enough to run some trial and errors on matches that were at least close. But I tried for years. I tried for fucking years without success. And then, your brother enrolled. He was as close to a perfect match as I could have ever hoped to predict. He told me about you, and your father. I was the one that set up your little hunting trip. I suggested that. And so that you would save your relationship, with a little brotherly bonding. And now, months later, and he's survived. - You son of a bitch! - Uh uh uh... No, we're just getting started. See, unfortunately, Eric, is beginning to degrade. Not because he's not a match, no no no no no no no. That's because he's a god damn junkie. You fucked up your insides, you stupid son of a bitch! So, I thought to myself. If there were only someone who had the same DNA as Eric, minus the excessive drug use, of course. You Donnie, it's always been you. - How do you know it even works that way? We're brothers, not twins. - 'Cause I tested you! In the lab a couple weeks ago. Why do you think I was so fucking excited? I knew instantly you were perfect. Now, our big guy, the big boy, well, he's still gone AWOL. So, I'm gonna have to have your brother here do his dirty work for him. It really is for the best. You know? Bye, pal. Hey, you two. Have some fun. Have a good time. Have a few laughs. Hey, life is a cabaret, alright? I miss you already. - This isn't real. Eric, it's me. Donnie, your brother. Eric, no! No! - Morgan, it's Donnie. You in there? Morgan. What the fuck? Morgan? - Hello? Who's there? - Oh Morg. - Hands in the air now. Don't you fucking move. Officer 1247, requesting immediate backup at Recklin Automotive. I've got a homicide, two suspects. One male, one female. Hey, I said stay where you are. I'm warning you, I will shoot. - Morgan stop, please. - What the fuck? - Morgan! Run.
