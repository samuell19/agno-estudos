(ominous music) Mexico, 20th of August, 1940. Trotsky was murdered, an ice pick to the head. With his death came the end of a duel at the very heart of the communist movement. Stalin, at the head of the Kremlin had finally eliminated his long-standing rival. Stalin, Trotsky. They were worlds apart. One was the son of a Georgian cobbler, the other a Jewish intellectual. One a methodical, calculating man, the other a brilliant, enthusiastic mind. One a cynic, the other an idealist. It was the end of a duel that had lasted 20 years. A political duel, a power duel. A duel between two men who were radically different. But above all, a duel to the death. But there is one question that lingers. Why did Joseph Stalin want to have Leon Trotsky executed when he had already removed him from power and exiled him far away? (bold Russian music) (crowd screaming) (tense music) Petrograd, February 1917. Czar Nicholas II abdicated under pressure from the people. But for Lenin, the revolutionary, getting rid of the czar wasn't enough. He needed to establish a new order, communism. He methodically orchestrated his take over in October, 1917, and this would ensure the success of his revolution. He had two lieutenants by his side. They had been there for 30 years, and were both promising characters, but were diametrically opposed. Joseph Stalin, and Leon Trotsky. But the duel between Stalin and Trotsky had begun a good decade earlier. London, 1907, the congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party. Trotsky and Stalin met for the first time. Trotsky was on the stage, Stalin in the audience. Trotsky's brio both fascinated and exasperated his frustrated comrade Stalin. A slow poison began to seep into their relationship. (speaking foreign language) It was Stalin's first time out of the Caucuses. It was his first time in London, the metropolis of the west, and he couldn't believe his eyes. He was a party delegate at a congress of the Social Democratic Party that brought together all the stars he had heard talk of in the papers, and he was going to be able to speak to them. And it was clear that Stalin was in awe of Trotsky, something he'd struggled to hide all his life. He was in awe of the man. (speaking foreign language) Stalin had obviously noticed Trotsky. Trotsky was everything he despised, an orator, an extrovert, and a brilliant mind. He wasn't brilliant. Stalin was a very poor orator. When you listen to recording of him speaking it's amazing. When he became the leader of the USSR he'd say a phrase, pause, and everyone would applaud. (audience applauding) (speaking foreign language) He'd drink some water, he says a second sentence, he stops, and everyone applauds. It's absolutely extraordinary. He's like some kind of machine. (speaking foreign language) Physically Stalin had a great handicap. He was pockmarked, and he was small. And Trotsky was, of course, physically, very imposing. The two revolutionaries fought the czarist regime under pseudonyms. Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili called himself Stalin, the man of steel. He had it all figured out. And Lev Davidovich Bronshtein hid under the name of Leon Trotsky. They each dreamed of changing the world, but socially, they couldn't have been more different. (speaking foreign language) Trotsky had a supposedly happy childhood in a family that loved him, that cared for him, that supported him through his studies, and which envisaged a great future for him. Whereas Stalin was pretty much born in the gutter, and he was exposed to a great deal of violence in his own home. His father was a drunk who would beat him badly. (speaking foreign language) Stalin is very interesting in terms of the Russian Social Democrats, which became the Bolshevik party, because he's about the only Bolshevik, and the only Social Democrat, who was working class. All the other came from the families of intellectuals, civil servants. Stalin would never be quite like them. They would always feel that he hadn't had the same education, that he wasn't one of their own. Stalin and Trotsky each grew up in a Russia ruled over by the czar. For centuries, this autocratic regime had fostered inequality. The huge majority of the population was made up of peasants, and they lived in very poor social and economic conditions. The country dreamed of a different society. Stalin was 20 years old when he embarked upon his revolutionary career, Trotsky was 17. But their struggles took on radically different forms. Through his culture and training Trotsky had a more intellectual vision of revolution. He loved to debate. He developed theories on ways to take power. His analysis was influenced by the great European socialist and Marxist thinkers with whom he was in regular contact. (speaking foreign language) Trotsky was in exile, and in exile he lived in a socialist society, a high society. He traveled around the whole of Europe, and he rubbed shoulders with all the great revolutionaries, all the great European socialists. He lived a life that was, one might say, in high socialist society. It was during his exile in London that Trotsky met Lenin and became one of his collaborators. His travels and his lengthy discussions with foreign intellectuals drove Trotsky to think of revolution on a global scale. For him, taking power would not be limited to just one country. (upbeat Russian music) On the other hand, Stalin, the Georgian, was a provincial man. A willing man who was scorned by the socialist intelligentsia. His only priority was revolution in Russia. For Lenin, Comrade Stalin was the man to carry out the dirty work. His delinquent past was skillfully exploited to fill the party coffers. Stalin blanched at nothing. Extortion, sabotage, and robbery posed no problems. (speaking foreign language) He was the revolutionary king of the Caucuses. He played cat and mouse with the police and he pulled off masterstrokes, holdups, ran revolutionary rackets, and murdered people. And he played a very important role, because it was through these heists and this revolutionary racketeering that he raised the funds to ensure the survival of the Bolshevik faction in exile. Because when you're in exile and you have no income, what else do you do? That's why Lenin referred to him as the wonderful Georgian, the wonderful Georgian who brought him the cash. It was great. (ominous music) In 1913, Stalin and Trotsky met again, this time in Vienna. And this encounter confirmed Stalin's first impressions. He felt snubbed. Stalin had a complex, something gnawing at him that he never got over, his desire to eliminate Trotsky. (speaking foreign language) The hour of revolution was approaching. Although Stalin and Trotsky were now both working for Lenin, it was already clear that beyond the ideals they shared they were totally opposed to one another. (booming explosions) 1917 was a pivotal year in the history of the First World War. Russia was fighting alongside France, and the British had been weakened by a conflict that had already been going on for three years. (solemn music) The soldiers were revolting. 1917 was a year of mutiny in the trenches and the start of the Russian Revolution. In February there were increasing numbers of strikes and protests in Petrograd. The czar was forced to abdicate. A provisional government was established but the Bolsheviks overthrew it a few months later. In October, Lenin took his place at the head of the first communist regime in history. He appointed brilliant revolutionaries to support him. Trotsky, of course, along with Lev Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev, and Nikolai Bukharin. Stalin, the man of the people, stood out among these intellectuals. In the face of this new regime, the czar's partisans dreamed of their return to power. They ended up fighting the Bolsheviks in a civil war that lasted five years. During this struggle, Lenin realized that he needed Trotsky's eloquence and charisma. Stalin was relegated to the background. (speaking foreign language) Trotsky had some eminent qualities. He was a great orator, a great revolutionary, and a great leader of men. Physically he was scared of nothing. He moved around in his armored train to the front during the civil war. That wasn't a problem for him. As for Stalin, he was developing his own method. (speaking foreign language) Trotsky would turn up at Bolshevik or Soviet Party congresses and would stir up the crowd with his brilliant oratory. People would applaud, and he'd already have left. Stalin would go around shaking hands, paying attention to the lowly militants, being interested in what was happening to them, knowing their names even. All kinds of things that were totally foreign to Trotsky, so Stalin gained a reputation as a good guy. (speaking foreign language) You have to remember that as soon as the Bolsheviks moved from Saint Petersberg to Moscow in the spring of 1918, and moved into the Kremlin, Stalin had his own apartments in the Kremlin and worked out of the office next to Lenin's. It was really no coincidence that Lenin appointed him Secretary General. He was the party man, close by Lenin's side. (speaking foreign language) And Stalin, in that role, gradually started weaving his network of contacts that would give him free reign over the party officials and their appointment. (ominous music) Stalin understood what he could get out of the party. But for the time being, Trotsky was the hero of the Revolution and the Civil War. He traveled thousands of miles to rally the troops that would make up the Red Army. On his armored train Trotsky traveled back and forth across the country using the weapon he understood best, words. He gave hope to the Reds while demoralizing the counterrevolutionary Whites. For Trotsky, the train was as much a weapon of war as it was a weapon of propaganda. Each day he wrote a journal that he had printed on board and he distributed it as he went. Like a real war chief, he shared stories of the soldier's daily lives, encouraging them and rewarding them. But Trotsky also used force and repression to make men sign up for the Red Army, which went from one million soldiers in 1918, to five million two years later. He had no hesitations about having anyone who opposed him shot. Empowered by his success in Russia, Trotsky hoped to spread revolution across Europe. In 1920, he launched an offensive on the Polish army in Warsaw, which was allied to the White counterrevolutionaries. But just when victory was within his grasp, Stalin thwarted his plans. (speaking foreign language) As head of the Red Army, Trotsky ordered the troops to attack. Tukhachevsky, who was the commander in chief, was attacking from east to west directly on Warsaw. To the south, there was a column under Stalin's command that was supposed to come up from the south directly to Warsaw. But Stalin never listened to anyone else, as usual, and instead of heading for Warsaw to take the Poles in a pincer movement, he stopped in front of a different city and besieged it. He just didn't show up. Rather than obeying orders, Stalin wanted a personal victory by taking the Polish city of Lvov. His stubbornness led to a Soviet defeat. They were subsequently obliged to make important territorial concessions to Poland. Between Stalin and Trotsky, this episode felt like a declaration of war. (speaking foreign language) And there were some fierce disputes after that, which explained what happened next. Because obviously, Lenin demanded reports of what had happened, and Trotsky presented a report that was highly critical of Stalin. Tukhachevsky also presented a report that was highly critical of Stalin, and it goes without saying that Comrade Stalin would settle his scores 15 years later. (ominous music) Stalin pondered his revenge, but for the moment he just had to grin and bear it. Trotsky ensured the Bolsheviks were able to seize power across the country. The Red Army final defeated the partisan soldiers of the former czarist regime, the Whites. But this also reduced Russia to a devastated battleground. In 1921, after a terrible drought, famine ravished the country, and 1.5 million people starved to death. However, within the party, Trotsky was at the peak of his popularity. He emerged as the natural heir to Lenin, who was seriously ill, and who would soon need to be replaced. In his post as secretary general, Stalin knew that he wasn't a favorite for the job, but he had already planned how he was going to get back in the race. (speaking foreign language) Stalin, who was less brilliant than the others, was nonetheless a remarkable strategist. Not just a remarkable pragmatist, but also a remarkable strategist. He had a veritable strategy for the creation of the Lenin myth, in which he made sure he had his place. (somber music) Creating the Lenin myth was the Machiavellian idea hatched by Stalin to deflect any criticism, and win the battle against Trotsky. His plan had two phases. The first took place on the day of Lenin's funeral. Lenin had been incapacitated by a series of three strokes that had left him weakened, and the founder of Soviet Russia eventually died on the 21st of January, 1924. He was 53. A huge crowed gathered in Gorki, near Moscow, to pay homage to the revolutionary. His faithful companions were also in attendance, Kamenev, Zinoviev, and Bukharin. They carried the coffin, along with Stalin. These three Bolsheviks, old friends of Lenin's, may also have been thinking about succeeding him, but what they didn't know was that Stalin was counting on using them to take power for himself, and that he had already sealed their own deadly fates. Only one top party figure was missing, Trotsky. (speaking foreign language) Trotsky was fairly seriously ill at the time, and was being treated in a seaside resort in the Caucasus. We now know, and they knew at the time, that Stalin had lied to him, telling him not to come back, that there was no point, as Lenin would be buried immediately. However, the decision had already been taken to construct a mausoleum. So Trotsky did was Stalin said, thinking he wouldn't get back in time, as it would have taken several days by train. He took a decision not to return which had lasting consequences. (somber music) (speaking foreign language) Stalin had organized an absolutely extraordinary funeral. This was a new kind of event. They were no longer in an imperial system, now they were in a revolutionary system. Embalming Lenin, so he could be on display forever to the bedazzled public was an aberrant idea, and it came from Stalin. Lenin's widow tried to stop the embalming, and the funeral arrangements. She was against it all. And that was when Stalin said, "Be careful. "I can find another widow for Lenin immediately." That was a threat, and not an implicit one. That was what he actually said. (solemn music) Krupskaya, Lenin's widow, had to bow to all of Stalin's wishes. The second phase of his plan to seize power involved Lenin's testament. On the 23rd of May, 1924, four months after the funeral, the 13th Communist Party Congress was held and Stalin read out the document. A few months before he died, aware that he didn't have much time left, the father of the revolution dictated a few words to his secretary. Without specifically naming his successor, Lenin gave his opinion on the qualities and flaws of those Bolsheviks that might succeed him. (speaking foreign language) This is what he said, "Comrade Stalin, having become Secretary General," and remember, it was Lenin who appointed Stalin Secretary General in early 1922, a few months earlier. "Comrade Stalin, having become Secretary General, "has unlimited authority concentrated in his hands." That is a strong statement. He continues, "And I am not sure "whether he will be capable of using that authority "with sufficient caution." And what happened afterwards proves he was right. (speaking foreign language) The paradox is that in his testament Lenin flagged up the dangerous character that Stalin was. But at the time, Stalin was a lesser player in the minds of the three other Bolshevik leaders. Initially, the fight for succession wasn't between Stalin and Trotsky, it was between Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin, and at that time, Stalin was still in the background. (speaking foreign language) So that was between the 23rd and 31st of December. And on the 4th of January, a week later, Lenin was feeling better, and said the last thing he would say about this matter. It's pretty amazing what he said. "Stalin is too rude." About time too, that somebody noticed, in the middle of all these extremely rude Bolsheviks, "Stalin is too rude, and this defect, "although quite tolerable in our midst, "and in dealings among us communists, "becomes intolerable in a secretary general. "That is why I suggest that the comrades think about a way of removing Stalin from that post." In this testament, Lenin is much more lenient with Trotsky. Granted, he reproaches his excessive confidence, but he also commends his intellectual qualities. He presents him as the most capable man in the central committee. However, Trotsky would never profit from Lenin's appreciation. Against all expectations, it was Stalin who pushed his advantage. (speaking foreign language) Stalin was very cunning. He staged the revelation of Lenin's will and said, "Comrades, the last words of Comrade Lenin," et cetera. "Comrade Lenin said I should be removed from my post, "so therefore I propose to resign from my post." And of course, because it was he who organized the congress, all the congress cried out, "Comrade Stalin, no, stay with us." It was a nice little show. And so faced with that situation, Trotsky was stuck, and this is what he said, and what finished him off for good. "We can only be right with, and by the party." Clearly, the party is always right. Of course, if the party is run by Stalin, then it's Stalin who will always be right. (ominous music) (speaking foreign language) From the point on, he created a kind of legacy for Lenin. He created Leninist thinking. That was what they called it. Like the thinking of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and then Stalin too. (triumphant music) (crowd cheering) So, while Lenin himself was recommending the utmost caution with regard to Stalin, Stalin pulled off the amazing feat of emerging as his heir. Trotsky realized that he had underestimated Stalin, and there were more surprises in store for him. (solemn music) In 1926, Stalin and Trotsky met up at the burial of a former Bolshevik, Gorczynski, someone to whom they'd been close. Stalin was walking up ahead, Trotsky, farther behind. The man who had led the revolution a decade previously no doubt knew that his days high up in the party were now numbered. This was the last time that Stalin and Trotsky would appear together in public. Now that the Civil War had left millions dead, Stalin, like the majority of the Bolsheviks had abandoned the idea of a global revolution. However, this was still an obsession for Trotsky. He wanted to take up arms again. Stalin had understood that in the country, as within the Communist Party, it was not the right time to export the revolution. (speaking foreign language) Because the people in the system wanted a quiet life. They wanted to benefit from the advantages that Stalin, as Secretary of the Central Committee, had granted. These were material advantages, advantages in a country that was hungry. Remember, the USSR had always known shortages. So having a job where you have material advantages, a food parcel every month, or a salary that is doubled, then tripled, then quadrupled, et cetera, was very important. And what's Trotsky going to say to those people, that they have to help the revolution in Germany, in China, in Britain? No, leave us in peace. It's the same for any political machinery. They want to be left in peace. (speaking foreign language) Stalin had a very good understanding of the triggers of human psychology, and I think that with a certain number of people who were of a similar character to him he knew how to manipulate the triggers of ambition, the triggers of jealousy, envy, the triggers for violence. He knew how to bring out the psychological traits in these people that would drive them to action. To action for Stalin's own benefit. (ominous music) To reach the very top of the party Stalin had to use the members of the politburo and play them off against each other. First he managed to convince Zinoviev and Kamenev to team up with him to sideline Trotsky. Then his manipulation continued. He got Bukharin on side against Trotsky, Zinoviev, and Kamenev. He was a brilliant dissembler, and slowly but surely managed to rid himself of all the old Bolshevik revolutionaries in his way. At the same time, he used his position as Secretary General to appoint people he could manipulate. He even went as far as to organize an intake dedicated to Lenin of low-ranking soldiers into the party, which, until then, had been the reserve of the elite of 1917. (speaking foreign language) It was in fact a key position because it allowed Stalin, through a succession of brilliantly managed appointments, to gradually replace those who had led the Revolution, and the Civil War especially, by a certain number of accomplices who owed their careers to him. They owed their careers, not to their revolutionary achievements, but to the prince of Moscow, Stalin himself. Stalin created a court of the faithful. However much Trotsky denounced the bureaucratization of the party, however much he criticized Stalin for being a man of the system, it was too late. The czar's trap had remorselessly closed around the prophet. (speaking foreign language) Trotsky was his own worst enemy, a victim of his remarkable intelligence, of his brilliant mind, that had indisputably led him, like others, to underestimate Stalin. "He is mediocrity," Trotsky said. That's how he described Stalin. Never in history have we seen such a host of brilliant, cultivated, and extraordinary minds that shared the same aim, to destroy the old order, and establish a new one. And among them, there was mediocrity, and it was the mediocrity that won the day. (ominous music) In 1927, Stalin settled his score with Trotsky. He expelled him from the party. Trotsky was then sent by force to Alma-Ata in deepest Kazakhstan. Stalin wanted to rid himself of his rival, but he couldn't kill him, not yet. Barley 10 years after the Russian Revolution nobody in the party understood such a decision. Then Stalin exiled Trotsky, chasing him out of the Soviet Union. Trotsky didn't know then that he'd never return to his country again. Although it seemed that Stalin had won over the party, the confrontation between the two men was far from finished. The duel would continue long distance. In February, 1929, Trotsky arrived in Turkey on the island of Buyukada, off the coast of Istanbul. His wife, Natalia, was with him, as well as his son Leon Sedov. Trotsky thought that Stalin had exiled him to Turkey to isolate him even more, and to render him powerless. He knew nobody in the country and didn't speak the language. But Trotsky wasn't too downhearted. By July 1929, he had created the Bulletin of the Opposition in which he denounced Stalin's behavior and policies. (speaking foreign language) The paradox is that theyexiled Trotsky, or politically eliminated him, or so they believed. But from that point onwards, and through the 1930s, Trotsky would continue his activities and would be a reference point. The only one to oppose Stalin and the power of the Russian state in such a way. He was exiled, not just because he was an irritation, but also because he refused political compromises, or to be silenced. (somber music) Trotsky tried to form an opposition, but from outside the USSR he had much less chance of being heard than from within. Stalin, the little hoodlum from the Caucuses, to whom nobody paid any attention, became the uncontested master of the Soviet Union. He was given the nickname "The Little Father of the People," an expression that hitherto had been reserved for the czars. (triumphant music) He gradually established his strategy, his networks, and his men to hold the USSR in an iron grip. Stalin had rid himself of any opposition, and from then on his aim was to industrialize the country as quickly as possible so that it could defend itself if there were another war. In a few years, Stalin would completely change the face of the Soviet Union. He built the Moscow Underground, constructed new towns, dug canals, and erected dams. It was all part of the edification of socialism. The aura he constructed around the Soviet Union was greeted enthusiastically by most communist parties in Western Europe, in particular in Italy and France. (speaking French) (triumphant music) (speaking foreign language) No secretary of a communist party at that time, from the early 1930s, could be appointed without Moscow's agreement. So it was either Stalin who personally oversaw it, or a secretary, and they usually chose these secretaries very carefully. Someone about whom they had some compromising information they could use again them. (triumphant music) Stalin became a hero for communists the world over. Moscow was a synonym for the promised land. Empowered by his strength and his success, Stalin had joined the big league, and his portrait now hung besides those of Lenin, Marx, and Engels. (speaking foreign language) But in order to have absolute power, he had to get rid of anyone who in any way would cast a shadow over him. (ominous music) Once again, Comrade Stalin pulled off a Machiavellian coup. He took advantage of the assassination of Kirov, a key member of the politburo who was executed in shady circumstances, to launch the systematic elimination of every enemy, and to set in motion a reign of terror. (speaking foreign language) As soon as he had the information he immediately understood the political advantages he would be able to gain from this assassination. He headed off in his special train to Saint Petersberg, or Leningrad as it was called at the time. He tidied things up, got rid of the witnesses who might have contradicted his version, and said that Kirov was assassinated by traitors of the party, and that Zinoviev was responsible, and so was Kamenev, and above them it was Trotsky. That allowed him to order the assassination of party members, which until that point had been virtually unthinkable. And from then on, obviously, it took on huge proportions. (ominous music) As with Lenin's succession, Stalin proceeded in a very methodical manner. His strategy began with a huge propaganda campaign that went far beyond the borders of the Soviet Union. In 1933, Hitler came to power in Germany. For communists around the world, the Fuhrer became the number one enemy. Stalin didn't hesitate to draw comparisons between Trotsky and the Chancellor of the Third Reich. (speaking foreign language) The anti-Trotsky propaganda was extremely violent. For example, the French Communist Party published a brochure, an anti-Dorio brochure, with Dorio behind a Trotsky mask, or a Hitler mask, et cetera. You can imagine during the height of the popular front, if you associated Hitler with Trotskyites and said they were Hitler's allies, the people were petrified. You couldn't support Trotsky, that would be unthinkable. So Stalin set an extraordinary propaganda steamroller in motion. In Vietnam as well, and China, everywhere. During the years 1933 to 1936, if a communist came across a Trotskyite, they would attack them, and liquidate them, if necessary, physically. (ominous music) Stalin gradually managed to discredit the men who embodied the party's old guard, or who showed any kind of loyalty to Trotsky. The second phase of their elimination was carried out through three trials held in Moscow between August 1936, and March 1938. Stalin had constructed the cases against the defendants in minute detail. He ordered the agents of the NKVD, his political law enforcement agency, to extract confessions from the old Bolsheviks. During their public examinations, Zinoviev, Kamanev, and Bukharin, among others, had to endure the haranguing and insults of prosecutor Vyshinsky, a close ally of Stalin's. (speaking foreign language) (audience applauds) (speaking foreign language) We now know that these trials were totally rigged. Totally rigged. They were complete fiction. The accused learned their parts, the prosecutor learned his, and they gave a performance. It was very well done, because, as you know, when you're dealing with terror, you can get people to do exactly what you want. (speaking French) There are awful stories of them saying to the accused, "Did you place nails in the butter of the people?" And these intelligent men, these great intellectuals, would reply, "Yes, we placed nails "in the butter of the people." And did you put nails in the eggs of the people? And these brilliant men would reply, "Uh, no we couldn't because they had shells." The foreign press corps was at the trials and thought it was completely normal. (speaking foreign language) (tense music) (gunshots cracking) Trotsky was also condemned to death in absentia, and he knew that Stalin had no intention of leaving the punishment undelivered. These trials developed, not from communism, not from socialism, but from Stalinism, that is from the irresponsible despotism of the bureaucracy over the people. What is now my principal task? To reveal the truth, to show and to demonstrate that the true criminals hide under the cloak of the accusers. (solemn music) But Trotsky's protests counted for little in the face of the Stalinist machine crushing everything in its path. All Trotsky's books, all the works in which Trotsky appeared as a hero of the revolution were removed from libraries, until the image of the founder of the Red Army had been completely erased. (speaking foreign language) And there is that famous photo that has been retouched of one of Lenin's speeches on an open-air stage. And there's a little staircase up to the stage, and Trotsky is on the staircase. Then one day, he disappears. There's nobody on the staircase, and everything was like that. That was typical of Stalin's methods, the retouching of photographs. (ominous music) (speaking foreign language) Those photos weren't intended to trick the old Bolsheviks, to trick the heads of the party. They were there to send a message, and the message was don't talk about these people any more. Now, talking about so-and-so, and talking about Trotsky in particular is not only punishable, but can be dangerous for you. (solemn music) After Turkey, Trotsky was given asylum in France, and then in Norway. But gradually, he became undesirable right across Europe. No leader wanted to risk offending Stalin by welcoming Trotsky to their country. Only Mexico agreed to take him in. Trotsky arrived in Mexico City in January, 1937. He and his wife Natalia were put up by Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. These two Mexican painters and militant communists agreed to welcome them. Trotsky still hoped to unify the partisans behind him. He created a new organization, the Fourth International. He also set up a commission to pull apart the accusations of the Moscow trials. But even thousands of miles away from the Soviet Union, Trotsky could feel the noose tightening around his neck. In 1938, he learned of the death of his son, Leon Sedov. He had undergone surgery in Paris for a simple case of appendicitis, but Sedov died on the operating table. For Trotsky, how he died left no room for doubt. Stalin had assassinated his son, and now he was next on the list. (speaking foreign language) He retreated into his bedroom for several days with Natalia. He took a little tea, and then afterwards he emerged. He had aged a great deal during those days of mourning. Often, when the secretaries, the comrades and the guards talked to me, he would tell them, "Don't talk politics with my grandson." He wanted to keep me away from all that. His whole family had succumbed, perished as part of that struggle, so with me, he wanted his grandson to survive. And he succeeded. Nobody else in my family lived to be 88, as I am now. (tense music) But Trotsky could still be a threat to Stalin. At least that's what the head of the Kremlin feared. In 1939, Stalin, who just a few years previously had denounced the Hitler Trotskyites, signed a non-aggression pact with Hitler's Germany to general amazement. He wanted to give himself time to fight the Nazis, but he knew his strategy hadn't been understood by a good number of militant communists around the world. (speaking foreign language) Hostility towards the German-Soviet pact ran deep. Everyone toed the line to a certain extent, but if they could get out of this unlikely alliance with Hitler, they would all have been in agreement. Trotsky was a known quantity, he was credible, he had the revolutionary prestige. He'd never negotiated with Stalin since he'd been exiled. And just imagine if he'd clearly and determinedly taken up a position calling on all militant communists to bury their differences and reject the German-Soviet pact. (solemn music) Despite being politically defeated and condemned to exile, Trotsky was still a danger to Stalin. By 1939, his physical elimination had become a priority. On the 24th of May, 1940, around 20 men dressed as Mexican police entered Leon Trotsky's house. Armed with machine guns, they fired into the bedroom where he was sleeping with his wife Natalia. Esteban, Trotsky's grandson, woke with a start in the neighboring room. (speaking foreign language) My grandfather was half-asleep because he used to take sleeping pills. Natalia quickly dragged him out of bed and pushed him into a corner, the southern, south-eastern corner of the bedroom under the table, and that's what saved his life. (solemn music) Miraculously, Leon Trotsky and Natalia were spared. The investigation showed that Siqueiros, a member of the Mexican Communist Party and a fervent partisan of Stalin, had led the attack. He and his accomplices were arrested, but quickly released due to a lack of evidence. In the days following the attack security at the house was improved. Bulletproof doors were installed, along with an electric fence, and an alarm system. But Trotsky knew that the attack of the 24th of May was just a dress rehearsal. The next time it would succeed. That's when Ramon Mercader entered the scene. This young Spanish communist, an agent of the Soviet Secret Services who went by the names Jacques Mornard and Frank Jackson, had been plotting to assassinate Trotsky for months. First, he seduced a young militant by the name of Sylvia Ageloff. She introduced him into Trotsky's household. Ramon Mercader gradually became a familiar figure. (speaking foreign language) Sometimes he'd take us out for a drive through the Mexican countryside. Yes, he'd give us gifts too. (speaking foreign language) Trotsky was so isolated in his locked down Mexican house. He saw this young guy turn up, he seemed to be Belgian, or maybe Canadian. Nobody really knows anymore, and it doesn't really matter, but he was a great admirer of Leon Trotsky. I don't really know much about politics, but I'd love to learn, and I'd really like to try writing an article in support of you. And there you have it. (ominous music) On the 20th of August, 1940, Ramon Mercader said he wanted to show Trotsky an article he had written. Trotsky was sitting at his desk. When he leant over to read it, Mercader grabbed the ice pick he'd been hiding in his raincoat, and plunged it deep into Trotsky's skull. Then, Esteban, Trotsky's grandson, who was 13 at the time, was coming home from school. (speaking foreign language) Immediately I felt this anguish that something terrible had happened. So I hurried home, I went into the garden, and immediately bumped into one of the guards, and through the half-open door I could see my grandfather, lying there on the wooden floor, covered in blood with Natalia and the guards. And when Grandfather heard me coming, he said to the guards, "Get Esteban away from here. "My grandson mustn't see this." And at the same time he said to the guards when he heard the moans of his killer, "Don't kill him, he has to speak." (solemn music) Trotsky was immediately taken to hospital. He died from his wounds the following day. 300,000 people attended his funeral in Mexico. Before he died, he spoke the following words, "Tell our friends I'm certain of the victory "of the Fourth International." Ramon Mercader was sentenced 20 years in prison. When he returned to Moscow in the 1960s he was greeted as a hero of the Soviet Union. Trotsky went down in history as the thwarted heir, the man of a different communism. But his death also bears testimony to the power of Stalin, capable of murdering an enemy thousands of miles away from Moscow. Killing him politically wasn't enough. The czar had to slay the prophet. After Hitler broke the German-Soviet pact in 1941 Stalin fought an epic fight against Nazi Germany to stake his place as one of the great post-war victors, right up there with Churchill, and Roosevelt. Stalin had not only vanquished Trotsky, but he had carved out a definitive place for himself in history. (stately music)
