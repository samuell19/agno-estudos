Two Germans at the back. Fortunately, General AUGUSTIN will come to my rescue. Help me call for him. Augustin. What a great day... Two English pilots, A French hero My granddaughter spoke of you and your great courage. Really? You mentioned me to your family? How about her. She was great. I am not surprised.

You are so showy! Be careful... Be very careful. Fine. Wait for me... We'll be back! Look, they ran off! They are abandoning us! Darn, I never thought they could be like that What will become of us? Do not worry, we will keep walking. We will make it anyway, gentlemen! Wear your shoes Lean on my arm for support. See, that's what the English are capable of. I'm surprised. They were rather nice. You must have had an English nanny! Thief! Thief! These shoes are not made for long walks. That explains why. I accept your kind offer. What offer? To lend me your shoes. What size do you wear? Same as yours. All right Ah. That's better. Wait for me. Come on... I have to get used to them. Come on, get moving. The Germans! We're lucky you have quick reflexes. Thank you Don't mention it. How about the Englishmen? What? They will be caught You're right - they should had stayed with us Alright. Let's go. Wait. I return you your shoes. I'm afraid of making them bigger. Ah yes. You are damaging them... Are my shoes ok? A bit wide. Sorry about that. Are you coming? Come on, come on. Who did you steal this from? Me. Good morning, sirs Good morning, Sister. Let's hurry.

What? Really? Excellent! We searched the whole train. There was no other Englishman. Excellent. Search the entire neighbourhood. Yes Major. Send him to the nearest Kommandantur ... Meursault. Ok, Meursault. I'll be there tonight. Maybe we should turn around... Sorry chaps, too late to go back. What did he say? Throw pumpkins at them. Ouch Ouch. You confuse my head with a pumpkin! Stop pushing, you'll make me fall out! To the right! This is not England! Give me a pumpkin, quick! No more pumpkins, we're out of ammo. We reached Meursault. I know. I can see for myself! Now we have to find I'Hotel du Globe'. This you cannot see. Enough. Push me. No, the saddle. Don't forget to brake. You may fall otherwise. What's the matter? Why are you making so much noise? My chain came off. Give it to me. I'll fix it. You are really clumsy. To go faster, you ride my bad bike and I'll ride yours. Second time you've done this. First my shoes, now my bike. It's normal, no? Ah ok. I'm sorry. Actually, why is it normal? Because... Because I am a manual worker is it? Yes, that's rite, yes! But you know, It's not your fault. It won't last. I'm fed up of traveling with someone like you. You are dumping me. You found the perfect excuse. This is all your fault. There was no need to run errands for the Brits. We could have stayed with them at the nunnery! They could not fetch Peter themselves! I don't give a damn about Peter. And neither do you! You dragged me here for that girl from the Guignol Theatre! I forbid you from talking about the girl from the Guignol Theatre. I'm fed up. Manage on your own. Don't want to see you again. Same here. Quick! Thank you. Be quiet! Nobody. Do you have a match? I don't have anything. Look at the time! And drunk again! Forgive my husband, general. And mine, general. Go to the kitchen, there are dishes to be washed! Scoundrel, come here! Today is my birthday. Champagne for these men! Woman should not order man around. Man wears the trousers! Even if trousers are too big. How to get to 'Hotel du Globe'? Straight ahead, Major. There you are. Number 6. Sorry gentlemen, But you will have to sleep together. Unthinkable! In the same bed? This is wartime... Leave me alone. This belongs to war atrocities... Leave me alone I said! Why? Sorry, please move over. Augustin, help me. With pleasure, Juliette. We were afraid you would not make it. They are combing the region for you. It must be because of Peter's arrest. Peter arrested? That's awful. But us? What will we do? What will happen to us? At dawn tomorrow, I will get you smuggled you to Free France. You will meet your British friends there. What is that? Curfew. They cut electricity. Who is knocking? It's the front door. Stay put. Yes? We requisitioned a room, from Paris. One moment, gentlemen. Maybe they are coming for us? No it's for me, a requisition. Good night. Have a rest. You'll sleep well, the beds are good. I will wake you up at 5 am. Let's go, Juliette. Sorry for keeping you waiting. Would you please come in. Good night Juliette. I wanted to say... I'm happy to be here. Very kind of you Augustin but... Quick, get back in. Sorry gentlemen but the hotel is full. I could only get you one room with a big bed. Number 9 It's wartime, madam. There's a washbasin in the room. If you want to take a shower, it's at the end of the corridor on your right. Thanks You will sleep well. The beds are good. Do you mind? Sorry. Come to bed. I will never get used to it. Of course you will - don't be a prude. Little Stanislas will be real comfy. Please... Get the covers back. Sorry. You are not married rite? No. Neither am I. But it won't be long. Cos Juliette... War does have its benefits... I want to ask you... Do you find me attractive? It is late, let's go to sleep. Good night. Forgot to tell you: I snore. But it's ok. Just whistle and I stop. I'm not gonna whistle the whole night long! What's wrong? Are you upset? It's Interval time. I get hungry. My stomach goes like this... I have to eat. Are you crazy? You can eat tomorrow morning! The hotel is full of Germans! Am I not the owner's husband? Close the door behind me. Am I not Juliette's husband? Steuber! Yes Major? Go get me some food while I have a bath. Yes, sir! During the war, a house painter... a charming man... met a lovely blond girl. She passed him off for her husband to save his life. Today, war is over. Victory has arrived. So of course, we must kiss... Augustin... Yes, I know. It didn't work. But war is not over yet... Do you really think we must wait until Victory day? We must go to sleep, and for good this time. What is it? Sorry sir. Lieutenant Steuber Excuse me sir. Who are you? Who are you? I am the owner's husband. I am the Maitre d'H Are you the boss? Not boss, boss's husband. Is there anything left to eat? Nothing left to eat, nothing! How about this? I forgot about this. It's eatable, yes. Is that a German officer? German officer, really? Looks like a general. General, really? This one can be eaten. Would you like some? I cannot eat a German officer Cannibal? Good night, madam. Thank you for keeping some food for my officer. Naughty liar... Your food, Major. How nice of him... Thank you Stanislas. How are we today? Do I get a smile? Yes, he looks better. Continue the treatment for 48 hours But decrease the dosage slowly. Are you happy here? Stop looking so glum. Better be sick here than able-bodied elsewhere... Next! Ah, a new one. What's wrong with you my son? Oh, he does look ill. Sit up. Show me your tongue. Your tongue. White tongue, yellow eyes, red nose... Liver disease! Pain there, that's the liver. You enjoy all good things in life right? That's very bad. Sit up. Say 33...! Say it! I see... I admitted those 2 patients, doctor. This one and the one next door. Best remedy is a change in scenery... Straight away, doctor. You will still need to keep an eye on this liver... Juliette get up, go make coffee. I'm coming. Time to wake up! What is the matter? Sorry, wrong room. 5 am. Get up! It's 5am! What on earth is the matter? What is the matter? Sorry, wrong room. 5 o'clock - Are you crazy? The major is tired - He's resting. What are you doing here? Come on boy, come on! Mine fits, but yours... Your helmet Yours Your military police breastplate. Your gun. Be careful they are loaded. Juliette, open the door. They will be your guides. They know the way. Don't worry they do not bite. With my dogs and the uniforms, you are the patrol. What if we meet the real patrol? They will think you are another patrol. Do not release them. It happened before and the men got lost. Good-bye Juliette. Are you going back to Paris? Yes, back to Guignol. No more General Augustin. No But he promised to visit me. After the war. Actually I wanted to tell you... A wall. What do we do? I don't know. They seem confused. Hold onto the leashes. I'll get over the wall and get the dogs. But they will bite me. They can't. They are on the other side. Don't move. What are you doing? Come on, climb over the wall. Be careful! I'm here! Help me come down. I can't. I have the dogs! Come closer. Stop, stop. Why would you want them to stop? So that you can come down. It's quite alrlight this way. You don't actually believe I'm gonna carry you on my back? Don't waste time chit-chatting. Let's go. This is the third time. My shoes, my bicycle... Go towards the left, there... You think it's this way? Yes. Ok You are very heavy for your height. Wait for me! I am here. You saved my life again. I thank you. We have no dogs. We are lost. I'm exhausted. If we stay here, we will be captured. Great. No, come on... I want to stay here. Leave me alone! He's not gonna have a nervous breakdown! I want to go back to Paris, back to my paints. You'll see them again... My brushes.. Silk, Brand new. Let's go. I'll buy you a box of big square ones. You need round ones. You don't know anything. You'll come to the shop with me. And my paints? We'll buy 3 tubs in the same shop. Come on. If Juliette was here, she would know. But look, I'm here! This is not the same. You'll see her again, your Guignol girl... Don't make fun of her, or else... Sorry, are you feeling better? Maybe another one would help. You ok now? Tell me, you don't want one yourself, no? No, I'm ok, thanks. You'll get one anyway! First, we go to the Kommandantur I'm delivering the 2 barrels of wine behind you. And they renew my 'Ausweiss' It is a pass that lets me enter the free zone. What if they refuse? Never happened. They like our wine too much. They are right. We will then cross the border line. Hide, we are arriving. These days they arrest each other. They mustn't be doing too well. Please do sit inside. We will bring the Englishman. Come out! Quick! Good morning, sir I bring wine for your colonel Excellent, sister. 4 barrels? No, 2 only. This one and this one. Do you understand? Yes, sister. You ausweiss, sister. Come, sister. No, these two. There you go, sister. Thanks. Stop! Turn back! What is he saying? Turn around! March! Halt! Dismissed. They captured Mr Augustin and Mr Stanislas! What shall we do? Let's have a quick drink. Are these the 2 Frenchmen you are looking for? Yes. We have them. They are here. They can kill me. I will not talk. Same for me. They can kill you, I shall not talk! I knew you could be relied upon. We must get out of here. Impossible! I have an idea! Since you played Wagner, how do you say 'Come in' in German? Herein. Bring him back to his cell. What is wrong with him? What a nice surprise... This way please. The Brits are here. We must stall for time. Herr Conductor, this time I am the one conducting! And you will be doing the singing! 12 bullets for you, 12 bullets for you. What a waste for men like you! Who gave you the dogs? Who got you the uniforms? Who are your accomplices? Enough shaking! Mr Chief of police... I am not chief of police, I am major! I shall not waste time. I shall tell you everything. Excellent. You are becoming reasonable. I had an appointment on November 15th. Sorry. I had an appointment with Commandant Jean-Pierre, who actually is Sergeant Henri. His real name being Marechal! No, no, there's a small mistake, Major Harbach. It was not a Monday, It was a Sunday. It was not November, since it was January! And Henri was not named Marechal just yet at the time... But I was born in 1914. It was the First World War. For 4 years, 4 years Frightful 4 years... Who is Marechal! I don't know anymore! He interrupts all the time, coughing and spitting, coughing and spitting! Try to remember... It happened in Victory Square. Just opposite the bronze statue of Louis XIV Is there a Louis XIV satue there? Impossible. Why? Because at the time, the Germans had already removed the statues! You dare take me for a fool! I know we are missing 2 English pilots! How many? Two! That's not much... You know where they are, and I know they are not far! Long live, Napoleon I gave the wrong barrels by mistake. What? Wrong barrels! Barrel? What is barrel? Quick, there are two men downstairs. They will burn! Take my mask! Mr Lefort! Ah, Mr Bouvet! It's me. Stanislas. Come on, let's go.

Yes, it's you! Look! Look! They will strafe us No. Reconnaissance plane. Don't look at them. They are spying on us, Let's look nonchalant. Do you like cowboy movies? The door is closed. There's a padlock! Open the hangar doors! Gliders! I was sure they were still here! Sadly, no propellers... That's the problem... Fugitives took a turn at the Marble Cross. I did not understand. Please repeat. I repeat, turn at the Marble Cross. Over. Understood, thank you. Come on, push! I'm pushing, step on the clutch goddammit - Sorry Sister. It's no use. There's no gas! There's one litre. That's enough. That's it. Get out and push! Where is second gear? It's in the car. Where? Between first and third. Thanks... Push! Come on, sister. Push!
