Make the right offer, Gray. Before this turns into a bidding war. Okay Jack. How did you get her? Dean hasn't exhibited for years. What did you say? Trade secrets, Marie, trade secrets. Well perhaps you could work your magic on your father. I'd love to know what he's doing. Wouldn't we all? Ruth. I thought we agreed you weren't coming tonight. I hate to tell you what a great job you're doing here. Yeah I think we've done pretty well. You should enjoy it. Really enjoy it. Because it's over. Sorry, what? My family is selling the gallery, Jack. What did you think, Jack? You'll just carry on managing the gallery indefinitely? We are divorced. At least we will be when you sign the papers. This gallery is my home, Ruth. I've put everything into it. Everything except money. Okay. I'll buy the gallery. Did you win the lottery? I could maybe sell the old Italian house with my dad. The deserted barn no one's allowed to mention, let alone visit? Your dad's a selfish prick who's never even been to your gallery. He'll never sell that place and you know it. Stick to the lottery plan, Jack. I'll give you a month. Robert Foster here. You know what to do. Dad, me again. I'm on my way, I'll be 20 minutes. Please be ready to go. We're on a tight schedule to make the train to Cali. Hello? Where's your stuff? I travel light. You're not packed, are you? I thought it was tomorrow. You could at least have called or left a message. Hey Robbie. Have you seen my jacket? Oh. Hi. Yeah, Jessica, this is my son, actually, Jack. Jack, this is Jessica. Hi, Jessica. Fuck you. Jessica. Jessica. Jennifer? Jennifer, Jennifer, shit. Okay, tea. I'll make the tea. You go pack. Are you gonna read the whole way there? The Dover road is famously the most boring drive in the British Isles. Ask anyone. So you're not gonna talk to me then. What would you like to talk about? I don't know, the usual father-son stuff? What are your views on Hentai manga? Do you see it as art or pornography? I meant like how's work. Oh, I see, an off the peg conversation. Ah, how's work? Forget it, read your book. No, no, this is starting to get really good. Are you eating well? Did you see the game last night? What game? You know, the one with the ball. How's Ruth? She's great. Sends you her love. Terrific. Okay, what's bugging you? Spit it out. I'm worried the house won't be the way you remember it. Why not? You haven't been back since you were seven. I mean the walls, for example. The walls haven't been painted in decades. That's an easy fix. The grounds might need tending. Look, I'm not expecting Xanadu. We just cheer the place up a bit and get it sold. Why the rush? I don't hear from you for months, and then this sudden need to sell the Tuscan house by last Tuesday. The house that's been basically empty for 20 years? Look on the bright side. You'll be home on Saturday with a big check and you can blow your half picking up stray women in bars. Don't make assumptions about my current lifestyle based on Jessica. Jennifer. Jennifer, fuck. Jack. My point is we should take a moment. Look. Ruth and I decided to buy the gallery from her parents. So yeah, that's why I need the money, okay? Flying dinosaur, 11. Is it, I don't know, why don't you ever drive-a-saurus? It's never 11 letters. How about a game of I spy? I spy with my little eye something beginning with Q. Let me try. Oh my god. I'm gonna wake up in a minute. Things always look worse in the dark. What the fuck is that? I'll leave you to it. Huh!? Pass me the knifey bit. At least the view's quite good. That's what you're calling one of the most spectacular convergences of nature ever? The view? You haven't even looked at it. Two cypress trees frame the compositions subconsciously propelling the eye across the negative space toward the focal point of the perfectly central villa, all unified by these magnificent undulating Tuscany hills. Late afternoon, remember. The way the light hits those windows takes your breath away. No, that's the dust doing that. I mean how could you let it go like this? Oh an interruption, what a shame. Must be the estate agent. Damn, she's early. We'll mark the view as a 10 but the potholes down that drive are a serious drawback. I may have whiplash. One of you is Jack? I'm Jack. Kate Lewis. Jack. Sorry, I've said that. Robert. Hello. Now, let's see what we have here. Not perhaps the best first impression. Things can only get better. Front door? Ah... Well I don't even know what to say about this whole situation. Do you know Frank Swine? Should I? That is my homage to his style. You painted it? I see. There's a large hole in your roof. Yes, but it's got great bones. Don't you think Kate? Or you prefer Katie? Just Kate, plain Kate. A bonny Kate. And sometimes Kate the cursed, but Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom. From the Taming of the, The shrew? By Shakespeare. Do you think we can make a quick sale, Kate? Well that depends. On? On whether you hope to make a profit. Tuscany is a romantic idyll. It's why all my clients come here. If I were to bring them to this house in this state they will say to me, "Kate, you promised me a dream. "A dream orchestrated by Puccini "in which my worries would just float off "into the infinity pool. "But instead you have delivered me a building site "whose walls seem to have been painted by Mussolini." Having said all that, if you put your backs into it I don't see why you couldn't turn this around. In the plus column, your plumbing seems to work. People care about that. And I like, as you say, its bones. I wouldn't if I were you. It's about to rain. I wouldn't go on the bathroom for a while if I were you. There's a large weasel in the sink. That's not a euphemism. No, we'll get what we can for the house, isn't it? It'll be fuck all. But this is impossible on my own. Or we could keep it. Except the weasel. They're too friendly for my liking. Listen, we are going to sell this house one way or another. Get on board with that. Where are you going? I've got a gallery to buy. Jack, what do you want? Ruth. I just wanted you to know I'm in Italy and I persuaded my dad to sell the house. So? So it means I can buy the gallery. Sorry, you were actually being serious. It's on the market, it's already been in trust. You said I had a month. Do you need some help knocking the others over? Are you always this busy? Mondays I'm closed. So. Where did you learn to speak English? Bugs Bunny. Huh? Bugs Bunny. In Italian schools, kids are forced to watch cartoons for five hours a day just to learn English. Really? Mhmm. It's the laws. I had no idea. That's actually pretty cool. Of course not. I lived in England for a year. I worked in a restaurant there. And you, you're on holiday? Oh, no, no, I wish. I'm actually here to sell an old family house. I see, where? It's out of town towards Pienza. Oh my gosh. This is amazing. I know. Is your house near the deserted house? It's probably the same one. With the beautiful lake? Mhmm. I love that house. Really? You wanna buy it? Well, I can only pay you with risotto. How many bowls do you want for it? Three should do it. And I want a nice bottle of red. You obviously don't understand how good this risotto is. Okay, fine. Two bottles. They have to be big ones. I haven't even seen what it looks like inside. Well, that's the main selling point. Thank you for the really lovely food. You know you're lucky to have that house. So pretty. No. It needs a ton of work. This took me five years to fix. But now. Five years? I don't even have five weeks. Anyway. Jack. Natalia. Natalia. When I first saw this house, you can't imagine how stunning it was. I've been thinking. It deserves to have its history honored. Well, whatever we do, I need to do it quick. Right. Start tomorrow then? Properly? This place has not changed at all. Good, okay. I've divided the jobs up into the ones we can do and ones we need professionals for. Maybe Kate will know some workmen. What do you think? Dad? Did you ever see this film? No. I say we do the painting ourselves, downstairs first then we hit the bedrooms. Or maybe we just, are you listening at all? I'm multitasking. Uh huh. What did I say then? You said something fascinating about painting. Anyway, you're getting way ahead of yourself. We've got a far bigger problem on our hands. So? Just a minute. Okay, let me look then. It's still there. Okay, well what's the plan? Make it jump out the window. How are we supposed to do that? One, two, three, war. What? It's a classic technique, Jack. Tried and tested. One, two, three? War! Let me get this straight. You're saying we charge the weasel and hope it commits suicide? Out the window. The window isn't even open! You have a better idea? Wiseli. Ferret. Feratu, feratu. No, no, no It's like a rat but, It's big. Good teeth. The size of a baguette, like a rat baguette. Rough translation. Very doable. Again and I'm paraphrasing here. Not a problem. Great news, couldn't be better? You're a fast learner. Dad? Dad? Do you want to take a picture of the mural or something? Do I what? Well, we're gonna have to paint over it. I just wondered if you wanted a memento. You're planning on removing one of my paintings? It's just to give the buyers half a chance of being practical. Why? Are you expecting them to be as blind to the beauty of contemporary art as you? Look, obviously it's not without artistic merit. Not without artistic merit? Is that your professional opinion? What's that supposed to mean? Those who can, do, Jack. Those who can't run their wife's gallery. Wait a minute! If you're so bloody can-do, where are your paintings huh? You haven't done anything in forever. Not true. In the last five years, I've completed several paintings actually. I'm warning you, Jack. You touch that wall and I will not be responsible for the consequences. I will not lift another finger around here! What's going on in there? Wow. Don't dare patronize me. The ones you finished as good as this? They're terrible. I don't know if I'd incinerate them. No, no, I've had enough of this. We're in Italy. The least we can do is have a decent meal. Now this is more like it. Tonight, they screen a movie in the square, always very popular. But first, everyone comes for dinner. I'm Natalia. Shit. Robert, I'm honored. Sorry. My dad. Roberto. It looks like you're full. We'll find room. Okay. Excuse my family, they're celebrating. Oh, your family? Yes, it's my brother in law's birthday. That's my sister, Clara. Oh my god, this is amazing. Probably on a Tinder date. On a what? Tinder. You know what Tinder is. It's an app. You know what an app is. Yeah, I know what a bloody app is, Jack. Okay, well, Tinder's a sort of dating app. On a computer? No, it's an app, it's on your phone. On your phone? Yes, it's an app. Just stop saying it's some fucking app. Well it is. Ugh, I despair. What happened to dancing? The well timed drink? The miracle of a chance encounter? Well now, they've got this algorithm that replaces chance with probability so you're less likely to be disappointed. Oh, bullshit. Disappointment is an absolute certainty. Everyone lets everyone down at some point. How you come back from that, that's romance. Roberto. Okay. Oh, are you English? Marzio. Natalia. Maybe so. Maybe so. Excuse me. Natalia has told me about your. I am very old but I remember the family that owned that house. Their name was, Pazzini. That was my wife's family. You? You married the Pazzini girl? Wonderful. Amazing view. Amazing view. Did you like the film? I couldn't understand any of it. And half of me is from here. I heard about your mother, Jack. I'm sorry. Yeah. I must have been able to speak some Italian once. Can't remember anything. You repeat. Amazing view. Hey, you two! This man has a birthday to celebrate. Come on! Woo! Wow, this is such a rare Vespa! Guys, who did this?! Guilty. No guilty, you are. Luigi. How the hell did you get that thing going? Ooh. Very dramatic. And you have all the whiskey. Who's this? That's my daughter, Anna. She's eight. And a quarter. Don't forget the quarter. She looks just like you. Here. This is? Her father. The guy from the restaurant? He's my ex-husband. I fight and win the divorce, I fight to save my baby. She's the only thing that matters, but, I lose. Because he lied about me. So I only got her half the time and some holidays. God I'm so sorry, Natalia. We have very good holidays. Natalia! Luigi! This is really fun! Hey! This is good. Nah, it's okay. No, no, no, no. I mean, this is pretty. Thank you. It's beautiful! Like me, ah. It's pretty wonderful. Luigi! Luigi! Wait, wait. Excuse us. Stay down. Ah, no Roberto no, please, please. Don't move, I work fast. Have you painted many port... Shh. Can I see it? Okay. But remember, you'll hate it. People, they're no good at seeing themselves. Okay, I'm ready. Once you get the eyes, you're basically there. Roberto, where did you get this amazing bike? My wife found it, I think. Why do you always do that? What? If you ever referred to Mum which is practically never, why is it always my wife, your mother? Why do you never use her name? She's called Raffaella. Yeah, okay, Raffaella. And why is that bike all that's left of her in this whole house? I mean that's weird, isn't it? It's like she didn't exist! I think you've had too much to drink, Jack. If you cared about her at all, why would you let her house fall apart? Jack, we have guests. Of course, guests. Sorry I can't do the Foster charm to order. I'll leave that to you. Jack? Wait. You know, we didn't have one conversation about Mum after she died. Not one. He never even mentioned her death. He just, he told me about how I had to become a man now. Which is a fucking joke because what does he know about being a man? I really tried to be a man for him. I didn't cry at the funeral. I was so proud of that. I look at seven year olds now and half of them cry when they drop an ice cream. But I didn't cry. I don't think I know how to grieve. Wait. Natalia? No, it's fine. I just, it's fine. This is Ruth, leave me a message. Ruth, it's Jack. Listen, please don't sell the gallery to anyone else. I'm serious about buying it. Just don't do anything hasty. Please. There are some very powerful lay lines here. Can you feel them? Tuscany is very creative. Michelangelo, Rafael, Da Vinci. Mr. Foster here. They all feel it. Of course. Oh god. Don't touch the counter. It's still... White spirit. Stop, you're just making it worse. This black mark is a sign. You can see that, can't you, Kate? You know black is for fear, for darkness. Right across my vagina. Have you ever read Interiors magazine? Um... I thought not. If your creativity's reach is only as far as toping large splashes of misery over your surfaces, may I suggest you enlist some outside help to guide you towards something more commercially advantageous? You know, I looked you up. I Googled you. Robert Foster. You were so good and successful and then poof, you disappeared. Well, I'm very flattered you looked me up. Listen, I need to ask you something. You did such an amazing job with the interior of your restaurant. I was wondering if you could give us some hints about decorating our house. Are you serious? I know exactly what we should do. But I've been wanting to ask you something. Why are you selling it? Jack is. Jack owns the house? We own half each. But Jack's memories of the house are maybe not so good. That's why I sent him to boarding school. You sent him away from you? I just, I didn't want him surrounded by reminders of his mother, like me. And it's harder when you can't ask your best friend what to do. You know, he was actually happy here once. I made him this swing down by the lake. Just an old tire and a rope. God, he loved that thing. I have an idea. Why don't you drive us into town? It's a really fun car. I don't drive. I just don't. After what happened, because of the circumstances, I couldn't drive Jack. I couldn't drive and couldn't paint. Oy! Oy! We've got guests. I've called in the cavalry. New color scheme. It's gonna look amazing! Hi. She says your hair is all white. Anna likes painting. Elephants mainly. Anna! Anna! Anna Look at you both. This is terrible. Ana We have to thank you. You should be our first dinner guest when we finish painting. Tomorrow night. Tomorrow night? It's just a bit of paint, Jack. No one ever wants to cook for a cook. I know my way around a sun kissed tomato. Never doubt an artist when he wants to create. And then you can tell me the end of your mountain climbing story. I know my way around a sun kissed tomato? What? You can't even boil an egg. And what's this mountain climbing bullshit? Well I went on a very good walk near Chamonix. No, seriously. It took all afternoon. Right, you lazy ass. Come on, time waits for no man. Idle hands and all that, chop chop. Hi. Do you speak English? a little. Okay, great. So I need to cook a meal and it's for this pretty amazing girl and she's a really good cook so I need to make something great and I can't cook. I have a son too, I understand. Don't worry. Where have you been? She's gonna be here in 30 minutes. What are you gonna do about food? I can't give her cheese on toast. She's a bloody chef! Keep your hair on. The woman at the deli said this ragu's restaurant quality made specifically for her shop. Pff. Pssh. But what's your secret? How did you do the onions? The onions? Mhmm. That's a very good question. I always think, the secret with onions is to, I'm not good with those cheffy terms you hear on TV. Jack, what do you call it? Oh, the... It's on the tip of my tongue. Stirring. No. Reduction. Reduction. Yeah. Yes. That's the one we reduce. And you have to stir it a lot. You're dead without the stirring. There's a technique. Clockwise, anti-clockwise. Simmering and stirring and reduction. It's an old family recipe. Oh, it's your family recipe? Well... Maybe more like the recipe of the lady who runs the shop that I bought it from. Right. You've tasted this ragu before? I make it for her. Oh God. It's so peaceful here. This lake's the only thing I remember about this place. There used to be this old swing just over there. Over there? Your father told me about it, how he made it for you. Oh he didn't make it. I think it was just there. Well, until it broke. This swing? How the hell? I dare you. What? Ha, you're scared. I'm not scared. Do you want, you're daring me to swing on this? Whoah! Jack? Okay. Jack, are you okay? Oh you laughing at me, huh? Here, give me a hand up. No, no! I was in agony. My life had just been destroyed. I needed to do something with the pain. I just moved to Italy. My husband told me for years he didn't want children until it was too late for me. Then he got his secretary pregnant. So I upped the stakes and started again out here. Except, you never really can start again. No. You can't. Well, Mr. Foster. Robert, come on. Robert. I salute you. I suspect we're going to make a comfortable sale here. Bravo. Great bones. Yeah yeah yeah. This is ticking a lot of boxes for me. Talk me through the plumbing situation. It works. Pipes in these, too much can be a bitch. Southwest facing, huh? It is. And the pool gets the light all day long. Let's check out these acoustics. Yeah, let's do it. Do what? I love it, I love it. Shouldn't we at least look at the other places? Yeah see, that's why I love you. You keep me grounded. How many more places on the list? Um, three, I believe. Let's crack on then. What a dick. Still, it looks like you have a sale. Did you change your mind? No, I need to sell it. Why? Well. I should have told you. I'm getting a divorce. We've been separated for a while. She's taken everything. I know how that feels. I managed her parent's art gallery for her. That's how we met. And we were just too young to you know? I was really good at that job. And now they're selling the place so I'm gonna use the money to buy it back. It's just, I can't follow in Dad's footsteps. You know, he's so charming and easy and talented. I can't paint like him. But I can make real success out of the gallery. You want to impress him, of course. He never even came to the gallery. He thinks I'm a failure. Really? Did you ask him? My whole childhood's in this room. I wanted to tell you, but... But what? I was afraid of how you would take it. It's like you literally locked up all of my memories. Yes, I think that's exactly what I did. I... tried to find the fastest way for you to be out of pain. You never let me in. You never fucking let me in! You never talked to me! Why? Why do you never talk to me?! Why do you hide this from me? No! Jack. Get off me! Jack. Get your hands off me! No, no. No. I'm sorry. She had very elegant wrists. Do you remember? No. I don't remember anything. When the hospital called after the car crash, there was this Italian consultant on the line trying to explain what had happened. But he was speaking so fast I thought you were dead. And I thought I had lost you both. The despair of finding out that Raffaella was dead and the relief that you weren't, you'd think that those two emotions couldn't exist simultaneously. But they can. Do you think about her much? I think about her every day. You can't remember and I can't forget. Just stopped trying in the end. Is that weird? You loved watching Italian quiz shows together. Did we? It was the host's ridiculous hair. You both thought it was hilarious. You'd spend ages in the bath making it with shampoo. She loved it when you did that. I remember she was really angry with me before we got in the car. It's almost my only memory of her. She was shouting at me. I don't know why. Dad? Oh fuck, I'm so sorry. What? I was losing the light. What's the matter? I was supposed to be looking after you down by the lake. You were on your swing and I was painting. The next thing I know Raffie ran down from the house. Someone had called from town. You had walked all the way to your school and I hadn't even noticed you were gone. I was so wrapped up painting! And I should have driven to get you. But you were losing the light. I was supposed to be in that car! Oh God, I'm so sorry, Jack. You've lost your mother and it's my fault! Ruth left me. We're getting a divorce. Oh, thank God. What? I've been pretty sure for months, but, what a relief. Wait, you knew? What did I always tell you? Don't even think about marriage until you're at least 35. We guys don't have a clue who we are before that. Wait, how old were you and Mum before you guys got married? 29, but that was a different situation. Well, it's your lucky day. I'm going full asking. Let's close this quick though, that's my condition. Katie here says that... Kate. Come again? Her name is Kate, not Katie. Got you, so Kate says that works for you. Job done, everyone's happy. Darling, you know it's so musty in here. Let's make this wall a glass one, shall we? Yeah, yeah that's a great idea, babe. Obviously this piece of shit goes. Right. Looks like Mr. Angry painted it. You should know that what I'm about to say is not just because of how dismissive you have been of such a beautiful house or indeed my craft as a painter. Although, let's face it, that didn't help. There is nothing musty about this space. And it wouldn't be improved by either a glass wall or you living in it. Sale's off, time to go. What I'm trying to say is get the fuck out of my house. Robert, please. Sorry. Get the fuck out of my house, please. Very robust language. Extremely vigorous. Well. Fuck 'em. What just happened? Well you should have heard the prick. I will not sell this house to a couple of culture thugs, Jack. That's why we're here, to sell the house. And you're arguing the toss over a bloody wall you'll never see again. Listen, I just thought that... You thought what? That one conversation would change everything? That I'd suddenly forget the last 15 years? No. I can't do it, Jack. I just can't give this house up. Oh my God, you never had any intention of selling this place. Did you? What's this? I made a quick cash sale on my London house. It was worth a lot. Enough to buy you out of your share in Italy. Buy your gallery back. Why did you never come? Ruth told me you didn't want me to. She said I'd be pressure you didn't need. Where are you gonna live? Italy, I think. I'm going to host painting holidays, would you believe? Kate's idea, actually. Already got a bit of free advertising on my app. You only have 12 followers. Don't knock it. You know who else had 12 followers? Al Notti! That's great. And then if we can add some here as well. Yeah that's fine. Now, however. Sorry, just one moment. Ruth. I have something for you. Look, even if you did win the lottery, we're not selling anymore. No, I'm serious, I won't accept any offer. You'll accept this. I should have signed it a long time ago. Good luck with everything. Try for a touch more contrast there, Susan. Maybe the banana wants to be a little less green? I was aiming for a jungly malaise. Excellent artistic intention. Oh. I was inspired by your wall. But I thought you, It's grown on me. Excuse me for a moment. It turns out it was never about the money. But I want a father. Why didn't you call me? I came to see you. You were with your husband and you looked together. He's the father of my daughter. I have to keep the peace. Okay well, what do we do now? We start again. From the beginning. You go. Oh you mean now? Mhmm. Okay, I'm Jack. Hi, Natalia, nice to meet you. I'm a hundred percent single. This is great news. I have no job. This is terrible news, goodbye. Okay, your turn. Oh. Great mother. That girl is my heart. I know. I know. I painted her about a thousand different ways and barely scratched the surface. This one's not bad. I'd put it on the main wall. Which main wall? Kate's showing me a gallery space in town tomorrow. I'm thinking of this artist called Robert Foster for my first exhibition. You know him? Uh huh. That guy? Very rare to see any of his later work. Although I hear he's quite busy again. I heard that whisper.
