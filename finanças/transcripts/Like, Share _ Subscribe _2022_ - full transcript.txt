Hey, boy! Give me a newspaper. Ah, I gave you a rupee extra. Enjoy. CABINET EXPANSION METERS FOR MOTORS! HOME MINISTER LAUDS YOUNG YOUTUBER REQUESTS PUBLIC TO SUBSCRIBE TO GUVVA VIHARI CHANNEL OPPOSITION FIRES AT HOME MINISTER’S TWEET I have always despised cockroaches. Today I despise you ten times more. Don’t ever show your face to me. I hate you! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, boy! Hey, boy! Stop! Stop, man! Oh no! What is this? After all a girl slapped you and you want to die? Wrong. There is a lot of time for that. Come. Who is dying, sir? My slipper was swept away and I was going to get it. You expect too much! Your slipper was swept away? Hey, boy! Wait, wait. I want to talk to you. Wait. By the way, boss! What is the tiff between you and her? That’s a long story, sir. Why should I tell you anyway? I don’t even know you. I am Prasada Rao. Retired bank employee. I can't sit idle at home. So jogging to the beach every morning... and listening to flash backs from people like you is my hobby. Please tell me, boss. -Sure? -Sure. Please. You have to. Tell me, please. Fine. -This story began in 1990. -Ah. Look over there. Do you see the horizon? It’s all our fields up to that point. Besides these, you have lot more assets in your name. What does ‘assets’ mean, dad? Assets are... those the innocent cannot earn despite a life time of hard work but easily made by a shrewd man like me more than necessary. Oh! Sir! The Adivasis want us to stop the bauxite mining immediately. We thought of using force to continue work, but they are backed by PPF. PPF? What is that? Is it a new political party? It’s not a political party, sir. It’s a blood-thirsty party. People’s Protection Force. They fight for the rights of the poor. They are more dangerous than the naxals, sir. Who can be more dangerous than a politician these days, Subba Rao? PPF or JPF can do nothing to me. I don’t want to stall the mining. What happened? PPF members, sir. PPF? Come out! Don’t be afraid, i’ll come! Tell me what you want. I will take care of it. Please, let me go. Whatever you want will be done. We want your life. Government bans PPF, responsible for a minister’s murder in 1990. An unending battle has ensued between the police and the PPF. Not a day goes by without land mines and AK 47 firing. Many police personnel as well as the members of PPF Organisation have been killed in the cross fire. A thirty year old war is about to come to an end. The newly formed government is ready to hold discussions with the PPF. We will have to wait and see what the PPF might demand and how the government would respond during the three-day peace talks. Take this, sir! Please take and give it, sir. Every poor man must be allotted land. Thousands of acres of land accumulated by a few in the state through unlawful means, must be distributed among the poor farmers at the earliest. Allotment of land to the poor is one of our government’s welfare programs. It is not a big problem. That... will definitely implement it. Next. Job reservations for the Adivasis must be legalised. And? I just don’t understand why we are holding talks with those who killed so many police! Why can’t they simply arrest them? On top of that, I have to welcome them with a bouquet. Damn it! You know what to do after the meeting, right? -It’s my order! -Sure sir! We have already informed, let’s see what happens? Sir, have to approve all our demands in the meeting. Our leaders who attended the peace talks went missing from last night. We see this as a conspiracy of the government or a cowardly act of the police. DGP Narendra should inform us of the whereabouts of our leaders at once. Otherwise, just like this jeep, DGP’s family will burn tomorrow. As a gift, we send you these three for now. Please tell us where the missing PPF leaders are, sir. Many lives are lost in this twenty year long struggle. Enough now. Let us discuss in a congenial atmosphere. Look, Mr Raju! The government or I consented to peace talks only because you are the negotiator. Gopanna and you are wrong to hold us responsible for their missing. But of course. All of you share the same ideology. Put the phone down. Sir, sir... What did you do? What did you do with the PPF leaders? This is a stunt by the PPF leaders, sir. They had no interest in the peace meeting at all. They cast aspersions only to defame the government and the police department. He issued a public warning threatening to kill my family. You think of peace talks with him? Impossible! It is better to stop all these meetings and react strongly, sir. All I asked about was the tiff between you and her. Why do you tell me about police, PPF and peace talks? T-20 and OTT have destroyed patience, sir. -You don’t want to hear me out? -I will. Tell me. On opening in Hyderabad- Do you know why this is called ? Uh...since its picture is printed on cigarette packet. With your kind of knowledge, -you are better off washing glasses here. -Sir! If I see you in the frame again, I will beat you black and blue. -Go! -Oh, no! Jack Daniels! Coming! Why is he coming with such fervor? Sir! Sir... I have seen your profile in Facebook, excellent! Industry is the same. -Who am I? -Jack Daniels. Not my name. What is my profession? How can I not know, sir? Bahubali, Saho, Ram Leela, Sultan, Baji Rao Mastani... Bollywood cameraman who worked on such great films. Hey, you forgot Dangal. Oh, yeah, sorry. Dangal. -Sir! -Hmm? -You use the lens so great. You are great, sir. -Come to the point. When the cameraman is waiting, how can you come so late into the frame? Um...there were days when I ordered pack up and left because Salman Khan was late. Garland... This... Oh, my! He has noticed. Garland from corpse... Did you pick this up from a dead body? No, no. I bought it paying fifty rupees. Only for you. Why do you message me every day that you would like to meet? -What do you want from me? -Uh... one minute. Here. This is my YouTube channel, Mr Daniels. It’s called Guvva Vihari. Guvva Vihari? Actually I am a travel vlogger. Basically travel blogging is... visiting a beautiful place. Finding all the novel things there. Meeting all kinds of people. Facing an unforgettable experience. Shoot everything and upload it on our YouTube channel. And then? Like... Share... and Subscribe Do not underestimate my channel. I have thirty subscribers you know? I don’t get why those thirty people have subscribed to watch this nonsense. Actually... Hey, Mia Kalifa’s new video is released. It’s mind-blowing. What the heck? Really? -Where? On which site? -Give me the phone. Mia Khalifa... Uncle, uncle, uncle! My phone is switched off, can i borrow your phone? It’s urgent! I saw your daughter’s picture in paper. I heard she is a state ranker? Why do you still use these old songs? Play trendy songs to attract youth like me to the temple! Give me your phone, come on. So, basically you are not a travel blogger. You are a cheater! Poor thirty subscribers. Why only 30, Mr Daniels? It’s 31. When you were watching the cuts, I used your phone to subscribe. Oh, shit! Forget the bell in the frame, danger bells around you are louder. Mr Daniels! Daniels! Please, wait. Mr Daniels, please wait. Only you can help my channel reach next level. What do you mean? You expect me to snatch phones from others and press the bell? No, no! Not so much trouble. Just shoot my videos from behind the camera. Tell me the movies I shot. Bahubali, Sultan, Saho, Ram Leela and Baji Rao Mastani. You left out Dangal again. Uh... sorry, sorry. Dangal. But... when I have already worked for such huge films, how did you think I would work for your channel? Mr Daniels! You got to help me. If professionals like you don’t help, how would aspirants like me come up? Go on a three-day trip with me. I will give you an unforgettable experience. I promise. -It’s not that. -You have agreed. That’s it. Please, please. -I won’t let go. -Fine, fine. Okay. One condition. You should be able to afford my remuneration. Don’t carry a penny. I will hand over your remuneration along with your travel expenses with flowers. These flowers? What? Why are you taking him around like a tourist who came to see Charminar? Won’t you leave him today? Okay. But where is the trip to? America? No! To Araku. The DGP didn’t react till now. He must have definitely killed our leaders. He doesn’t know what a vicious blunder he made. What do we do with people who don’t know? We let them know. But to do that we need shrewdness along with guns. We must do something clever. That reminds me- Where is Brahmanna? Hey, Brahmanna! Brahmanna! Fire, fire! -Commander is calling you. Come. -Is it? Let’s go! Commander! It’s been three years since I joined the squad. I was assigned no task. You sent for me for the first time. Order me, Commander. Whatever the job, even if it costs me life, I will fulfill the job. I believe you were sleeping? No, Commander. Though it appears to be sleep, I was only contemplating with my eyes closed on a strategy to eliminate the DGP. If you were in contemplation, how did we hear you snore? Actually... Intelligence is as important for the movement as sacrifice. You are ready to sacrifice. But you are not at all clever. Why do you say that, Commander? How can you say I am not clever? Based on the members you recruited to the party. Brother, brother... -Give me the gun just once, brother! -No. I will just see and return That’s all, brother. He is more interested in the gun than the movement. You are the one who joined him. Hey, give me also some. Get lost. I don’t have enough myself. How can you ask from me? No amount is sufficient for you. He eats food that can feed the entire Party. It was you who recruited him. Hey! I touched. Now, it’s your turn to bend and I jump over. Damn! Look at them. You are a rhino without horns. Will I survive if you fall on me? He wants to jump! You didn’t touch me anyway. Squad should be my strength. Not my burden. Party has been tolerating you for three years. Please go back to your home now. Please, don’t say that, Gopanna. I swear by the gun which is the breath of our movement. You won’t have any problem because of me. -That gun doesn’t work. -Ah! It doesn’t work? I have been oiling it with Parachute coconut oil every day! Why Parachute? It won’t work even if you use Navaratna oil. Not just yours. No gun of those you recruited works. Leave your guns and please go back to the main stream of life. You will be paid your bus fare. I stole this from Gopanna’s squad. This is the only gun that works. -Do you know why I am giving it to you? -Why, brother? Your name is Gurumurthy. Your name itself carries a target. Oh, no! What is this? Why did you shoot like that? I checked if it’s working. It does! Our only objective now is... to prove our strength to Commander who dismissed us. He should request us back to the squad. We must plan something big in Araku. Super, brother. Say it again filling Araku with the resound of your statement! -Shout it out, brother. -Why? You are our Commander, brother. Whatever you do should be effective! -You think so? -Say it! Araku! We are coming! Uh, dad! Coffee. There’s ten rupees in the shirt pocket. Take it. Dad, it’s been ten years since I came of age. You still want to give me ten rupees? -I want a lakh. -A lakh? Whatever for? I told you I want to be a travel vlogger. I have to go to Araku. I have already fixed a great cameraman. When I make a video and upload it on YouTube, thousands will watch it and there will be lakhs of income. I will be the next big thing on YouTube, dad. Look. Give me a lakh for the expenses. It’s just an investment. I will return it to you. I am not a capitalist to invest. I am a communist. That’s the problem. You named me Viplav denoting revolution. Whenever I try to talk to girls, they are scared I may remove a knife from my bag. They don’t even let me go near. As for my job, as soon as they see my name in the certificates, they reject me because they think I might start a revolution in the Company. That’s why I say... Pack one lakh. I will pack my bags meanwhile. Why don’t you give him the lakh? He wants to be a beggar or something. Mom! It’s not beggar... it’s vlogger. Whatever. Are you giving him the lakh or not? I can’t give you so much all of a sudden. How much do you have? -Is this the compartment? -Not this one. Come on. This one? We have to go a little further, Mr Daniels. Ah? Still further? It’s okay. Let’s at least get into this. Mr Daniels! Not this one. Further down. Man! Are we walking to Araku or taking the train? By train. Come. I’ll explain. Hey! Man! Why did you bring me here, man? This, Mr Daniels, is our compartment! [indistinct voices] This? What is this, man? -Are we really going in this? -Yes, Mr Daniels. This is a famous book used by many travel vloggers. Chapter one in this book is on budget travelling. We must make sure our transport is cheap. We are going to follow the same chapter. This chapter seems to spell doom for me. Though we have the money, there is a kick in travelling this way. I see no kick other than your stinginess. Why didn’t you request the engine driver? He would have made us sit on his either side. Hey! If only I knew how co-operative you are! -I will ask him right now. -Hey! No. It’s very hot there. This is fine. Why are there so many legs? Uh, tell me, where do you want to sit? Upper berth, middle berth or lower berth? Um... there is not middle bearth. Where are all those options? There is not even a finger space to reach the frame. I cannot do all this. I want to go home. Mr Daniels! Not the rich location all the time. You should also capture slum dog atmosphere in your camera. That’s how you go to Hollywood from Bollywood. See how many are there? Subscribers must increase by 300 overnight. What does that mean? This will go on through the night? Of course. Though we are on a budget travel, I will get you a water bottle however costly. Hold this. Hold the bag. The train started moving. Why isn’t he coming? Brother! Excuse me. A little... Hey, man! The train is moving. Come on. Camera. Shoot with the camera. I will come running. Camera? Shit! Did you see that, friends? So, if you get off the train for a water or idly, vada in the last minute, there’s a chance of you missing the train. So, get everything in advance. If you liked today’s tip, Like, Share and Subscribe to my channel. This is your Vihari. Thank you! He is not as innocent as he looks. I wonder what is in store. Biryani, hot hot Biryani, sir! Biryani...Biryani... -Oh... Man, man! Feeling very hungry. Can you buy a biryani? Both of us can share? Mr Daniels! Chapter 2. Budget eating. -We shouldn’t eat whenever we’re hungry. -Then? We must find the cheapest place for food and eat there. So, ten stations up, there is a station called Tuni. You get Pesarattu and Upma only for 25 rupees there. Let’s have dinner there. After ten stations you don’t call it dinner. You call it breakfast. -Please listen, try and understand! -Not possible. No! Show me your ticket. -Buy something. I am really hungry. -I was getting late so... -If you have no ticket, pay the fine. -One second. Or you will go to jail. -Please don’t say that, please sir! -Where are you going, man? -I beg you! -Not possible, madam. -Spare me! -What is the problem, sir? We have enough problems of our own. Why do you bother, man? Wait, Mr Daniels. What is the problem? They boarded the train without a ticket. And they say they don’t have money to pay the fine. Hey boy! We are from Nellore. We go round places, give dance programs and feed ourselves. I couldn’t buy the ticket because I had no time. Now he wants me to pay five hundred rupees fine. Where will I get it from, boy? I don’t know about your dance but you are a good story teller. First, pay the fine. She says she has no money! Hmm... here. -Show me your ticket. -You are a nice boy. You are so kind! You got to help me back. Tell me, boy. What can I do for you? You must sing and dance for my channel. Here? Now? It’s difficult, boy. Next time for sure. Hmm, fine. What did I say now, boy? Why are you so miffed? Fine, I will do it. Next station is Anaparti. The train stops for twenty minutes there. We’ll shoot it there. “What did I say, boy?" "What can I do, boy?” “In my Himalagiri’s lotus let an orange flower bloom” “What did I say, boy? What can I do, boy?” “In my Himalagiri’s lotus let an orange flower bloom” “What did I say, girl? What can I do, girl?” “In my Himalagiri’s lotus let an orange flower bloom” Mr.Daniels, what’s that cloth for? Uh, once I start the shoot, when public comes in between... I become conscious. I get irritated. Mr.Daniels, please take off the cloth and shoot. Okay. Don’t repeat it. “My lips are full my heart is set on you” “Meet with me once and drive my gloom away” “Your lips are full your heart is set on me” “Let me meet with you once and drive your gloom away” “I am at the height of youth and it makes me feel hot” “Keeping my beauty in mind come to me at dusk, my boy” “Height of youth... height of youth” “You are at the height of youth and it makes you feel hot” Really? “Keeping your beauty in mind I shall come to you at dusk, girl” “There is a well outside the village” “It has a mirror fitted sheave” “If you come to the well you will profit well, boy” “There is a well outside the village It has a mirror fitted sheave” “If we go to the well will we profit well, girl?” “Hey, boy!” "A door with embellishments sharp and sturdy" “Come behind the door, feel my charm and go” “Wow, wow!” "A door with embellishments sharp and sturdy" “I’ll come behind the door, feel your charm and leave” -“What did I say, boy.... -Hey, hey, hey” “O o o o o....” Hi, friends! This is Guvva Vihari Channel! Finally, we are in Araku. Take a look here to see the AC compartment we got off from. It is very cold inside. This is the level of cheating. And... hills all around and me in the centre... Get down! Brother! Your voice sounds different! Idiot! You had asked me to shout so loud for a reverberating effect across the forest. I don’t know about the resound but I’ve lost my voice. Dirty pig! Come now! And friends, the air here is pure. The sky is blue. Dust... is just like dust. -Friends, my advice to all our Araku travellers... -Ice cream! What are you staring at me? Huh? Down. Bend your head down. Brahmanna! If you are Brahmanna, your kid brother may get scared. Why would I? Out there, the world is waiting for my videos. You know that? Which world? Just say yes, brother. I will aim and shoot him right now. Trivial issue. It’s not proper to kill him. What is it? What are you discussing? Are you going to kill me? Huh? If I see you again, I will kill you myself. Out. Out. Out with the money. This is for my phone. Get lost! Hey, what is happening? Acting smart? You are still doing what I told you not to? What do you see there? I see a freshly frying puri, brother. How do you see puri with a hot egg dosa right there? Yes! Wretched fellows! I didn’t ask you to see puri on the left and egg dosa on the right. But in the center where the CI is thrashing innocent public! I will break your teeth. If I arrest you, you will never get out. He is the one we must send up. But he is already up, brother. -Why should we raise him? -You’re right! I didn’t mean that. Send him up like this with a bomb. He is going to die next week. Why wait a week, brother? Say yes. I will aim and shoot him right now. Shooting is too kind, Gurumurthy. He deserves a bomb. Only then will Gopanna know our range. Superb, brother. Say the same thing loud to make the entire Araku hear. Are you trying to make me dumb? Let’s go. Today i’m at Jaisalmer, can you belive it? Ah! It’s not a long journey from Jaipur. You have to... What kind of liquor is this, man? Even the liver screams and tells me not to drink! Hello, man! Why is your body language abnormal? What are you looking at on the phone? Vasudha uploaded a new video, Mr Daniels. It’s terrific! Who is this Vasudha? You don’t know who Vasudha is? What are you talking? Vasudha is a famous Telugu Travel Blogger. She lives in Delhi. She looks like... Ah! Like a six foot chilly in churidar. Like everything else, he is very bad at similes too! She has around three million subscribers. Take a look. She makes lakhs of money. Uh, she is the inspiration for my channel. It is my responsibility to encourage a girl who inspired me so much. That’s why I post a comment for every video she uploads. I have posted it. As if he owns a BBC channel and his encouragement matters. See, Mr Daniels, by the end of this trip,Guvva Vihari Channel will become great, greater, greatest... Hey, stop it, man. Why discuss things that don’t happen? Tell me the location for tomorrow morning. Hello, friends! We are now at the Katiki waterfalls. This is 16 kilometers from Araku and five kilometers off Borra Caves. Friends! These waterfalls have a unique feature. That is... water flows from the top of the hill down here to the ground like this. -As if this is the only waterfall in the world. -you will find that water is pretty cold. Those who know swimming can happily swim here. Those who don’t, can sit here and encourage the others. You know what to do if you like this video, don’t you? -Like, Share and Subscribe...! -Hey! [vocables] The most vibrant, vocacious, parkingly, sparingly captivatingly cool! -Hi, Vasudha! -Hi! Do you know me? Do I know you? Vasudha! I am your huge fan! I don’t mind missing the World Cup Final but not your video. Your Rajasthan video, your Kashmir video, your Kolkata video- Your Kolkata video is next level. I can even tell you what you wore for each video. -Really? -Yes. Okay. Good. V...V...Vasudha! Hey! Who is she? Mr Daniels! I told you last night, right? Vasudha, a Delhi based travel blogger. It’s her. -Hi. Nice height, dear. -Hi! Uh, thanks. This is Daniels. Bahubali, Saho, Sultan, Ramleela, Bajirao Mastani... He is a cameraman for such big Bollywood films. He came to shoot my videos on my request. -You forgot Dangal again. -Uh, Dangal! Really? Wow! -Thank you. -Very nice. You said video shooting. What videos? Vasudha! I am a travel blogger too. -Huh? My channel is called Guvva Vihari. Oho! So, you are Guvva Vihari! See how famous I am? What comments did you post below my videos? -What did I post? -Huh? Don’t look so innocent. Wait. I’ll show you. I have all the screenshots. Hmm. Look. ‘Why do you give your channel like Vasudha Telugu Traveler... and shoot all videos in the North?’ ‘So, are there no nice places in the Telugu states?’ ‘Have they no value?’ ‘Are all Telugu people idiots?’ Did you post these comments or not? Well, I did... As if you are not enough, others started saying ‘Yes, Guvva Vihari is right.’ I was scared even to upload videos. Only to put a stop to this torture, I came here by fight though it cost me lots. Oh! I must finish this video as quickly as possible, post it and shut you up and your batch. -Bye. -Vasudha! Vasudha, actually... Vasudha! Is this what you meant by encouragement? You are a rogue, man. Wait, Mr Daniels. Vasudha! Vasudha! Sorry, Vasudha. I didn’t post those comments to hurt you. -Only to get your attention. -What attention? Like everyone else, if I posted ‘Love your videos, your videos are helpful... you look beautiful’... you wouldn’t have noticed me? At the most you will thank me and forget. Look at you now. How you reacted to Guvva Vihari! -That’s why. -So? You will incite regional differences? But why do you want my attention? What can I say to that? You must understand. You post senseless comments. And then you want me to understand you. I had sleepless nights because of you. I faced so many problems, because of you. If you cross my path again or follow me, I will kill you. Waste fellow! Vasudha called me a waste fellow, Mr Daniel! What do you call a waste fellow other than a waste fellow? Issac Newton or Einstein? Do you know the reason for your problem? It’s your manipulation. Lead a sincere life, man! Do you know how I became a great cameraman? Not because of my framing. But because of my honesty. There is honesty in the air I breathe, in the food I eat and in the... Hey, Diwakaram! What are you doing here? How are you? Hey, who are you? Who are you? Hey, it’s me, Seenu. Did you forget me? No, no, no! You are mistaking me for someone else. Wait, Mr Daniels. -Do you know him? -Why wouldn’t I? He is Diwakaram. We are very close friends. What are you saying? He is Mr Jack Daniels. A great cameraman who worked for Bollywood films. Bollywood or real wood? He is Juvva Diwakaram. He makes videos of new Hindi films released in Satyam theatre in Hyderabad. He is a piracy camera man. Sir, sir! My wife is approaching, she went to get popcorn Sir, sir! Second wife, sir. Stop! You bloody! Brother, brother, leave me, brother. Please, brother. There is no question or possibility of leaving you. The soil of Araku shall be bathed in your blood today. How could you cheat me? You shot Bahubali, Saho, Sultan, Ramleela, Bajirao Mastani? You forgot, Dangal, brother. -Say Dangal again... -Huh... You are dead. When people passed by, you covered the camera with a cloth. I had a doubt then, piracy scoundrel! I used to cover it in the theatre in case the audience will notice it, brother. I took you for a celebrated cameraman and the kind of budget I invested on you! Remove your hand. Off with it. Budget? You had no budget for a toothbrush and I had to use my finger instead! Don’t even mention budget. Hit me or kill me. But don’t talk of budget. Damn! I thought you will work wonders and expected a good name for my channel. I don’t know what to do now! Brother, don’t worry. I am a piracy cameraman but I don’t compromise on quality. Check my pirated films. You will find them better than the original. Let’s resume shooting, please. More than the shoot, it is important to deal with Vasudha smoothly. I must explain all my feelings to her. I wonder where she is. -Hey, Piracy! -Hmm? See how cute my Vasudha is! If I were that pup, how nice it would be! So cheap! Why a pup? ‘A pup, a matchstick, a soap bar don’t look down upon any,’ said Sri Sri. Once such a great man said that, how can we not follow it? If I were a corn cob in her hands, how nice it would be! Hey, guys! Today is Sunday and I came to the market. This is very famous in Araku. What now, brother? Do you want to become the dung or her slipper? I want to hit you with a slipper. -Shall I try? -No. Not at all interested. Brother! Somehow I find more lust than love in the way you look at her. Hey! To love someone in part for their waist or legs like Telugu film heroes do, I am not a pervert! -I am a lover who loves their soul. -Okay! ‘They have come here and set up honey, herbals and you can see so many things!’ Wow! Her neck! It’s extraordinary! -It makes me warm even in this cold. -Perverted fellow! Hi, Vasudha. Good morning. Why are you back? -To propose. -What? Not what you think. -I came to discuss a proposal. -What is it? -Let us make a collaborative video. -Mm hmm! It will definitely help your channel. My generous heart takes the lead and says- It tells me to merge my channel with yours. Take them. Take all my subscribers. No problem. Your happiness is all I want. How many subscribed to your channel? Uh... add 300 to the existing. Ah... 331. I am one of the victims, sister. With 331 subscribers why do you talk as if you are doing me a favour? I would rather close my channel. But I won’t do a collaborative video with you for my life! Bye! “When angels come down from the sky to build a palace of marble” “Every bud would get dipped in dreams” “Every leave would turn into a rose petal” “Why didn’t you cast me a glance filled with love?” “Or the dew drops would turn into wine” “Steps that don’t match meet like unforgettable memories” “They shine as unforgettable milestones I don’t know what happened!” “Stranger to poetry, my heart churns out tunes” “It makes dreams on this journey with you” “All these years, it never felt like this” “Do you know what they call this spell?” “Saying like, share, subscribe how long will you stay solo?” “Merge your love with mine and write a different story” “Let’s see a world beyond NASA” “I am waiting here for Love VISA” “Saying like, share, subscribe how long will you stay solo?” “Merge your love with mine and write a different story” “Let’s see a world beyond NASA” “I am waiting here for Love VISA” One room. The way he is spending- Probably he is really in love. I wonder where Vasudha’s room is. Hi, Vasudha! I am here. Opposite room. Hello, everybody! Welcome to Vasudha Varma’s channel... brought to you by Big C and here I am today! Big C? We don’t have any. Um... Lamborghini presents welcome to Guvva Vihari Channel! Why don’t you get lost somewhere? We like this place too. We’ll shoot here as well. Stupid! Location shift! How many shifts? “Every leaf would turn into rose petal” “Dew drops would turn into wine” “Ho...O...o” “Where are the stars they ask Shall I show them your smiles?” “Where do we find sugarcane they ask Is it not in your words?” “Probably for you the sky lowered a ladder If it is named, won’t it be Rainbow?” “In spite of so many petals a flower cannot fly” “My heart has no wings and yet it drifts with you in the clouds” “Saying like, share and subscribe how long will you stay solo?” “Merge your love with mine and write a different story” “Let’s see a world beyond NASA” “I am waiting here for Love VISA” “Every petal turns into a rose” “Dew drops turn into wine” Mr Raju, I listened to you till now. Now you listen to me. I know the police too well. That’s why I was against peace talks. But they paid no heed. What happened now? In two days, you will hear the news of DGP is death. No one can stop this. Stop! Stop right here. Hey, Bull! Get down. Bah! Brother! Watch out! your stepping on my feet. My chips packet! What will you find to eat in a medical shop! Brahmanna, always pushes me back. I will go to the front at least this time. What is it, Brahmanna? What brings you here? Gopanna wanted medicines. He normally sends someone else. Why did you come? The regular guy went to Vizag. He asked me to bring them. No. Not this one. -I want a bomb. -What’s your budget? Altogether, we have forty thousand. A bomb for forty thousand? Is this a joke? Fine I am your Party’s sympathizer. But it doesn’t work out for me. Do one thing. I will talk to Gopanna. You can go. It’s not that, brother. Our Party is in a sorry state already. Give us whatever you can for the 40,000. Please, brother. Fine. Wait. I asked him for a bomb and why does he walk towards me? Go, get the bomb. Hey, you are sitting on the bomb, porcupine! Here, Brahmanna. -What is this? -It’s a time bomb. Why is it so tiny? There is one that goes off when pressed. Don’t you have it? That kind costs you five lakhs. Okay. Give me. We will adjust with that. Take it. Careful. Hey, Piracy! Is the camera set? I did but some guy at the market is harassing Vasudha, holding her hand. What? New to the place? You look great like a turkey. Interested? Please, let go. -Who is he? -I have no idea. But she is trying hard to free her hand. Do you want me to help, brother? Not necessary. Born for a cause, I am coming. Just wait. Where is he? Come on, show me! My blood is boiling. Where is he? You don’t have to get so aggressive. Take a look there. Hey, why do you show me some other guy? I asked you to show me the animal that teased Vasudha. That’s the same animal. It passed out and is lying there. Hey! Didn’t I ask you to wait for me? Why did you beat him up? Hello, brother! I don’t have the guts. It was madam. She first requested him to leave her hand. He refused. That’s it. When I was making a pirated video of Boyapati fim, I saw such bounce backs. After that this is the first time I saw it live. Come. Vasudha! What is this? What is this savagery? A girl is supposed to be delicate like a fresh bloom flower. Not like a WWF player pouncing on boys and beating them. When Dushasana tried to disrobe Draupadi, she waited for Lord Krishna. She didn’t beat the Kauravas black and blue. I am here to deal with such people. I am here to help, right? What is this? I don’t need your help at all. I took three-month training in kick-boxing... and then decided to travel solo. I know how to protect myself. And girls should be like flowers or paper sweets. That’s not my mindset. Whoever irritates me, meets with the same fate. Bro, I will make a suggestion. Will you take it? What? Please leave the girl alone. Look at her calves. By god’s disgrace, if both of you get married, you will have to say in Apollo longer than at home. If I really get married to her, I don’t care Apollo or Care. But that’s not the problem now. I have made up mind to bash someone. Now who is he? Hey, distance. There is a bomb in the bag. -Gurumurthy! -Brother? Find out the CI’s program. Hi, jilebi! -For me too! -Hey! It’s the same guy again. Sorry, boss. Those idiots pushed me. I slipped and- I don’t know who you are, bro. But you came at the right moment for all my frustration. Again! In such a huge market, with so many people around, why do you fall on me? Not just falling. You broke my phone! PPF...PPF! What PPF? You show off as if you are a hero from KGF! What is that bag? -What is that bag? -Nothing. Open it. Remove it. -No, no. Lad, please. Please. Don’t. -My bag! -Lad, please! -My bag! Hey! Huh! Aha! What is it? I only threw a bag. Why do you over react as if I threw a bomb? If I see you again, I will kill you. Get the phone, will leave. Hey, come. Thank god! Nothing happened. It didn’t explode though it fell from so high. Does this bomb work, brother? It landed on flowers. Probably, that’s why. Hey, someone rushed for Jilebi pushing me. Bring him. Uh. Okay. Okay, I am on the way. See you. Bye. -Husband! -Huh? Your birthday is nearing. Call the kid and ask her to come home. No, no. Let’s not. As per the intelligence report, our family has threat from PPF. She is safer at Delhi. -Understand? Don’t call her. -Okay. Okay. See you. -Yes, ma’am. Where do you want to go? -Araku. Why are you going alone so late at night? I sat watching the sunset and lost track of time. Hey! Hey! Who are you? Where do you want to go? This bus goes to Araku. But it won’t go to Araku now. There is a forest straight ahead. It will go right there. Hey! Start the bus. You hit me in the morning. That’s why we came prepared. Brother, does this bus go to Araku? Not to Araku. This bus goes to S.Kota. I told you, idiot. Get down! -Same colour bus... -Okay. Carry on. I told you it doesn’t go to Araku. Why did you get in again? I know, brother. But going to Araku is not important for me. This bag’s owner is important. What is it now, brother? I have to thrash you and take the girl. Is that it? There’s a brief pre-visualization. Let me concentrate, uh? Got it. Got full clarity on what’s going to happen. Come one after one. Vasudha, keep watching. Don’t even blink. Watch. Hey, hairy fellow! You come. Hey, hey! Why are you getting thrashed, bro? What do you want me to do? They are not following my vision. You think they are paid construction workers to follow your vision? They are goons who want to thrash you. The girl’s waiting. Go and bash them. Go and hit them! Hey, hey, vision man! Vision man! -Oh my god! -Bash him hard. Listen to me! Move, man! Vision man! Oh my! Bash him. Hey, hey... Hey, hey, put me down, please. Don’t blink your eyes. He wanted you to watch, didn’t he? Like a macho man! Hey, hold him... Come in...come. Pull him in! Brother, are you running away? -Come in, come! -No, man! -I just came out for fresh air. That’s all. -Hey, come. I don’t trust you. You are running away. Hey! Brother, hit them at least one. Hey! Police! Hey, run! Let’s go! Hey, cowards! Where are you running? Come on. Come back if you are real men. Bloody cowards! How am i looking... Don’t shout so loud. They might come back for real. -You think so? -Yes! What happened? Who are those men running away? Rogues, sir. They tried to molest a girl. That boy also is badly thrashed. Grandpa! Don’t say I was thrashed. Say I saved her. Though he is old, he can see clearly. He narrated exactly what he saw, bro. Take out your ID proofs. Thank you, sir. You came at the right time. -Hey! -Huh? I am tired with all the fighting. Go, order me some soup. I will order soup if you want. But don’t call your antic ‘fight’. It’s very annoying. One punch and your face becomes pulp. Go and order the soup. Forget about soup, you could have been in ICU. You said he is a Bollywood cameraman? Why are you so rude to him? I came to know only the other day. That he shoots pirated videos of new films. -Piracy cameraman? -Hmm. This laugh is much better than how you cried at sunset. Oho! -So, you saw me cry. -Yes. You remembered your departed parents and cried, right? Which dork told you my parents are dead? Oh! So they are not dead! I saw you cry alone and I thought you were an orphan. -Mm? -No? Why are you always so a cinematic? Sunset was so beautiful I got a bit emotional. That’s all. Of course, my parents are alive. I simply love my dad. He’s my everthing. Do you love your dad? Ofcourse! -Except in one aspect. -Which is? For naming me Viplav. Do you know the kind of problems my name creates? Mm...but I like your name. Viplav...nice! When you say it, it sounds good to me too. But since you like it, I like it too. First take brother away. Let’s go. Let’s go. Come on, guys! Quick! Sir, sir! -Sir, are you alright, sir? -Hmm! Ambulance... DGP Narendra Varma has narrowly escaped an attack by the PPF. He is currently under treatment in a private hospital. Let us ask our reporter, Uday, about his condition. Uday, what is DGP Narendra Varma’s health condition right now? Vasudha, how are you, dear? Dad! How are you now? I saw it on news. Are you okay? Everything is okay, dear. A small injury on the hand. Nothing to worry. -I will start immediately, dad. -No, no, no. You are safer in Delhi. Uh... the situation here is very bad. I am in Delhi along with your mom in a couple of days. We’ll meet there. -Take care, dad. -Okay! Tell me, Vasudha. How is Araku? All good, man. Listen. Uh...can you book me a flight ticket from Vizag to Delhi immediately, please? The signal is weak here. What is so urgent? There was an attack on dad. I knew he won’t agree to my going to Araku. So I came here without telling him. He will feel bad if he comes to know. That’s why book the ticket as early as possible, please. -Yeah, sure. -Thank you. Through the hands of the President! Please give it to me, sir. That one... Ouch! What is this, brother? I was receiving the National Award for ‘Best Piracy Cameraman’. You shattered my dream. Why did you kick me? Look! Vasudha shot my fight with the goons last night and posted it on her channel. Thirteen thousand views and 560 comments! They say I am a natural fighter and some think I am Vausdha’s boyfriend. You posted the boyfriend comment, didn’t you? Shut up! Their affection and enthusiasm gives me an idea. Get your camera. We will make them go crazy. 30 seconds per minute means sixty seconds for two minutes. It’s correct. It’s time for the CI to come. Make it fast. Brother! I am hardly setting alarm. I am setting a bomb here. It takes some time. Patience. a+b whole square... It’s 2ab. C++ Brother, are you sure the CI will use this bridge? Our recce confirms this is the only way the CI would use to visit his mistress. The bomb explodes and he will become minced meat. A good riddance for Araku. Gopanna will pat on my shoulder and recruit me back to the squad. It’s done, brother. Fixed. -Hello! -Brother, he has started. -Brother, he has just started.... -Huh! Good, good. Brother, he went past the Botanical garden. -Brother! -Huh? He went past the Botanical Garden. -Super! -Ah. Brother, he lifted the gate. Let him, let him. -Why is the share auto here, brother? -It will leave. No, brother. It has stopped. Why did he stop here? Hey, why is this guy here? After I saw the reaction for my action through their comments, I understood one thing. I am something else. What is that? Psycho? Sadist? Miser? Action hero, idiot! Like Jackie Chan? Mike Tyson? Thriller Manju? What is your plan now? Let’s bring the action hero out, shoot an action sequence and post it on YouTube. Then the followers will multiply. What you do is, go far and wait with the camera in position. I shall come running in slow motion. The bridge will explode in my background, -next... -Stop right there. Don’t talk without logic. Why will the bomb explode? Have you planted one under the bridge? I will use graphics. Why do you care? You have the silliest doubts. Go there and hold the camera. Go. No money to buy snacks. He wants to use graphics! What are they up to? Can’t hear anything, brother. -Brother! CI has passed by Shiva temple. -Huh? -Ready? -Come. Cut it. One more. Hey! Chase those two away! -Hey! Make it fast! -Going, brother. We are going. Wait, brother. -Fat pigs! -Come on, come on! Hey, brother, field! Filed! Bah! One more. Okay, we will do one thing. Brother, I will pay you extra money. Park the auto at a distance and stop the others for five minutes. -Okay, brother! -Okay, yeah! Where are our guys? Look over there. Give me some onions, bro. Onions. Bloody idiots! They are obsessed with food. Let’s go. -Why are you blocking the way? -Sir, it broke down, sir. Just ten minutes, sir. -Make it fast. -Okay, sir. Hair is a bit clumsy. -We’ll do one more, uh? -Whatever. Hey, stop! There is a bomb! Hey, there is some problem in the market. Turn the car around. Let’s go. Hey, you... Hey...damn! Brother, you said you will use graphics. Why did it go off for real? I am equally baffled. Brother, something is happening here. We better leave. Come! -Excuse me, sir? -Come in. -Yes, Govind? -Sir, I need to talk to you. -Tell me. -Uh, sir, that’s a bit personal. -Please wait outside for five minutes. -Okay, sir! I will call you. -Okay, sir! Hmm, tell me. Sir, where is your daughter? She is in Delhi. Why? Actually, sir, an SI saw your daughter on a bus going to Araku yesterday. I wanted to check with you if you knew she is in Araku. -It must be false news. -No, sir. The SI checked her ID card to confirm his doubt and the name was Vasudha. And sir, one more thing. Take a look at this video she uploaded in her channel, sir. Confirmed, sir. She is in Araku. We have information that Gopanna is somewhere around Araku. -What are you saying? -Yes, sir. It’s confirmed. He is there. One second. Damn. She has no signal. Send our men to Araku, Where did they drop my daughter, identify and provide her security. Sure! Okay, sir! Over. It’s all over. Before I become a cameraman, I will have my funeral in Araku. Hey, what upsets you so much? What do you mean? I said let’s shoot in hills and valleys. But you were vehement to show the action hero in you and took me to the bridge. Someone planted the bomb for someone and it went off because of you. They will definitely come for us. They will kill us both if we are caught. We have to escape before that. Let’s go. Let’s go. They might have started. Let’s meet Vasudha once before we leave. Stay alive and you can go to Delhi and meet her. Let’s leave from here first. There is no one in the Reception. We don’t even have to pay. Hey! It’s Vasudha. -Where are you going? -Delhi. Really? You didn’t even mention it. It’s urgent. That’s why. Very good decision, sister. Drop us at the railway station on the way, please. Sir! Yes, sir. We are starting now. Brother, the girl is in a hotel at Araku. If you make it here fast, we can get her, brother. The DGP’s daughter is in Araku. Kill her and give him a taste of pain. Get going. How do I meet you again? -What happened? -Sorry, sir. Before our men could reach there, someone abducted her. Who kidnapped her? What happened next? Tell me, boss! Quick. Hello! It’s the sea breeze effect I guess. -I need a break. -Huh? I will tell you once I am back. Hey, boy! Come fast! I can’t the tension. Are we done with the break, please continue. What happened next? Before our men could get there, someone kidnapped her. Hey! Who else would take her? Hey, come. It’s our gun only. Come! What was that sound? I can’t see anything. Am I watching 3D movie here? I cannot see either. -Antony! Untie him. -Brother! Idiot! As soon as they see us, they will be shocked and will kneel before us. Brother! It’s you! I was worried we were kidnapped by some Dawood Ibrahim or Injamam-ul-Haq. You are a ‘no problem’. Let’s go, man. Antony! Untie me, dear. -Gurumurthy! -Brother! Don’t wag your tongue. They will shoot us. Injamam-ul-Haq is a cricketer. Not a terrorist. Who are you, bro? What do you want? That should be my question. -Who the hell are you? -I told you we were comrades. I passed your rudeness for ignorance. I took PPF’s name. You beat me black and blue. I spared you because you are a young lad. We spent all our money on a bomb to kill the CI but you had to ruin that. We have to expel you today. Brother, brother! Sorry, brother. This happened only because I didn’t know who you were, brother. Actually, I am a travel blogger, brother. We went there for a video shoot but I had absolutely no idea of the bomb, brother. Also, I am one of you, brother. My name is Viplav! Brother, brother... so am I. R. Narayanamurthy’s films, brother. ‘Erra Sainyam’, ‘Orey Ricshaw’... I worked as cameraman for those films, brother. -You mean piracy? -Yeah. Who is the girl? Brother, I have no idea of the bomb or the issue. I have nothing to do with these two. Please drop me in the town. I have to go to Delhi. Why she is denying? You mean, there is no relationship? -Why is she talking like that? -Then? You expect her to say she is your girlfriend or fiancée for all your antics? Damn! We wanted to kill the CI, join Gopanna in killing the DGP... ...but you have destroyed it all. You have foiled all my plans. I don’t know what you will do. All the money spent on the bomb, ...the entire forty- -Brother! One minute. -What? -One minute. Come aside. Brother, what are you doing? I am asking for the forty thousand we spent on the bomb. That is why Gopanna called you mindless, featureless, seedless and sent you home. Tell them the bomb cost you five lakhs. If possible, we will buy a better bomb and we will execute the plan perfectly. Brother, ask them for five hundred extra. Chips packets are over. We must buy them. I didn’t expect this development, Vasudha. I am sorry. Please, don’t talk to me. Idea sounds good. But... Poor guys. How can I ask for so much... Brother, if we consider good and bad, we will get stuck here. We won’t gain the confidence of Gopanna. Think about it. Hmm. In the meeting we just had, the resolution we passed is... The five lakhs we spent on the bomb should be covered by you. Five lakhs? Brother, you won’t get five lakhs from this guy anyway. -Just kill us, brother. -Wait, man! Brother, five lakhs is impossible from us. We will give you 3,500. Set us free. He says 3500... I told you this is a sheer waste of time. Shoot us down, brother. Please, brother. -Hey, Gurumurthy! -Okay, brother. Brother, brother, one minute. Please. Vasudha! I have 3500 with me. If you adjust the rest, we can go. I will somehow repay that money in one month... difficult... in five years. Okay. What else can we do? But I don’t have cash on me. I must draw it from ATM. Okay. Problem solved. Brother, we will pay you the money. But we have to draw it from the ATM. Fine then. It’s getting dark. Let’s go to the town tomorrow and draw it. -Hey, Gurumurthy! -Brother? -Keep watch so that they don’t run. -Okay, brother! Vasudha! Vasudha, are you crying? About the money? Money comes and goes. Nothing in life is permanent, Vasudha. Look at me. How happy I am in spite of losing 3500! Who is crying over money? I am DGP Narendra Varma’s daughter. My dad put me in Delhi because of threat from these people. Your comments irritated me and I decided to come here but didn’t even tell him. Now, if something happens to me my dad cannot bear it. Vasudha, please don’t cry, Vasudha. I feel bad. Don’t worry. Since I am responsible for this, I shall take you to your father safe. Look. No one here knows you are the DGP’s daughter. Let’s go to the town tomorrow. We draw the money, hand it over and go our own ways. Okay? Do you understand? Are you serious? I know you get fired for sleeping at work. But do they fire you from the movement? They do. My brother is the proof. How many times should I tell you I didn’t sleep that day? That’s a lie every sleeping person tells. What is that, brother? Are there wild animals around? Animals? Reptiles, aquatics, animals... We spared none. We made fries and gravies of them and finished them off. Don’t worry at all. Eat. By the way, what is your dad? My dad? -Uh... -He is a rickshaw puller, brother. Err...they are very poor. She is the only girl in the family who makes a little money. The five lakhs she is going to give you are not hers, brother. Her company’s. So sad! -Is it? -Hmm. Still, you must pay five lakhs for the sake of the poor and for our struggle. Not just we, you must sacrifice for the poor too. And what is your dad’s name? DGP Narendra, sir. -I heard your daughter was kidnapped? -Yes, sir. I will be reaching Araku station in another five minutes, sir. If the public comes to know of DGP’s daughter’s kidnap, we will lose our face. So, deal very carefully making sure media doesn’t get wind of it. Okay, sir. -Sir! -Any update? Sir, the cab driver is in our custody now. There were two others with the girl. When we showed Gopanna’s photo, the cab driver said he didn’t see him. -Who kidnapped her? -I don’t know anything, sir. At least describe him! He is of my height, sir. He has curly hair. He is wheatish. There were ten others with him, sir. All of them had guns, sir. Send for the sketch artist at once. -Get a sketch of the suspect drawn. -Sure, sir. Immediately. Begin the search operation in the forest tonight itself. Hey, come! Brother, I gave up sandal wood cutting from the time you told me. You gave it up and started kidnapping tourists from Araku for ransom, is it? Tell me where you’re holding the DGP’s daughter after kidnap. I have no one with us except these. We searched everywhere, brother. There was no one besides these two. It is definitely a powerful man who kidnapped DGP’s daughter. Who could it be? Good morning, brother. Where are you off to early morning? Uh, we got ready to draw the five lakhs and give you. Okay. I will brush and come. We will start soon. -Okay. -Brother! -Who is this? -Our informer. He is not even an inch tall. What sort of informer? Brother, 300 police men are approaching this way. They will be here in half an hour. Because we blew up the bridge? Police are becoming stupid by the day. Let’s go to the dense part of the forest. Denser than this? Brother you said we will draw cash in the town. We will go tomorrow. Pack everything. Brother, brother! Let’s do this, brother. Send the girl to the town. Release us only after you get the money. How can we send the girl alone? It is not safe. Let the police go back. Then all of us will go together. Let’s go. Tomorrow again? I somehow feel they will know us. I don’t think they are ready to take us to the town. It’s better we run. She is right, brother. Let’s run. You think running in the forest is as easy as roaming Amirpet using navigation? We wouldn’t know where each path leads to. Listen to me. Your father is anyway coming for you. He could come here any moment. So we better wait. Brother, I have an idea. When he hears this, Brahmanna himself will accompany us to the town. -What idea? -I won’t tell you. If I do, you will implement the idea and steal my credit. -Hold on. I’ll be right back. -Hey, wait. Piracy! Hey, pack fast. Police may come any moment. -Hey! Catch him. -Brother! What? Our clothes are dirty. They stink too. Take us to the town. We will shop in Kalanjai and also draw and pay you the money. Don’t tell me nonsense. Tell me what you need now. Fresh clothes for three of us. That’s all, is it? Hey, Piracy! Wait, darling. What a brilliant idea you gave! Our wardrobe has changed! You deserve a hug. Come. No. You won't give me a hug. You will punch me. I won't punch you. Only hug. No. I am not interested. "The lion that hunts Becomes a prey...in such strategy" "They are buried neck deep in the the field due to bad luck" "When you are surrounded by danger, Who wins it all?" "Look at the lamb strangely dancing before the lion" "Without removing the mask, don't be fooled" "The hunter is quite strong" Bah! Gurumurthy! Aim there. You won’t get signal here. Brother, I can’t anymore. I am done. Tell me the lunch menu. I ordered three Bawarchi biryanis on Swiggy. They will be here in 5 minutes. Ask them to bring more curd. He always gives less. Hey, how did you become so fat in spite of living in the forest? I got it. Proceed. Tell me, Mr Raju. Gopanna, DGP’s daughter is kidnapped. -Since you are angry with him did you...? -I am not involved. But let me say this to the DGP who’s listening. If I find the girl, I will definitely kill her myself. Hey! Where to? Shh! Where are you going? -I am running. -Huh? Even in my sleep I only see this guy holding a gun at point blank range. Take this path and there must be a hamlet five kilometers down. I overheard them a while ago. Once we reach there, we can go somewhere. Come along with me, sister. What about him? They will have a problem with him. He won’t have any. Also, if we wake him now, he will begin his discourse. Let’s go. Come, come, come. Ouch! Why did you stop? Five elephants...they just passed by. Elephants? -Huh. -Where? That way. They said there are no animals here. You are mistaken. Come on. Ouch! Sister! Mr Daniels, help! Sister, this is quicksand! What do we do now? Hand me the bag. I’ll pull you out. This is not useful! Hold on. I will do something. Brother! Brother! What is it? What happened? Sister and I were trying to run away. What do you mean run away? Where is Vasudha? Exactly, brother. When we were running she fell into quicksand. I am not able to pull her out. Shit. I can swim. Let’s go. How can he swim in a quicksand? Shit! Brother, wait. -Brother! Brother, brother! -Vasudha! Oh damn! Do you ever hear people completely? What’s happening? Why am I not able to move? What’s wrong with you? You jumped in as if it’s a swimming pool! Don’t you know what quicksand is? Vasudha fell into something and I had to pull her out. Only that was running on my mind. And I forgot what quicksand is. What is the process now? Are you here for your passport renewal? Look at you asking about process. In another five minutes, both of you will be sucked in. But you will be the first. Then, both of you will die running out of breath. Damn! Sorry. In spite of your warning, I tried to run. All this is because of your stupid idea. Was this your idea, darling? What’s happened has happened. What is our plan now? Look for a stick or a rope! One minute. I already expected both of us will die this way. How? Romeo, Juliet...Laila, Majnu, Devadas, Parvathi ...all such great lovers died young. So will we. How are we lovers now? What is this, Vasudha? Why don’t you agree at least now that you are in love with me? Look. Two minutes just before you die, close your eyes and your favourite person’s visuals will flash before you. I read it in a book. Try it and you will see me. Huh? What other job do you have now? Why don’t you try? Camera... Hmm... you are right. Didn’t I tell you? Your turn now. Let’s see whom you will see. Obviously you. But I will reconfirm it for your sake. Viplav! I need to buy a surf packet. Please give me twenty rupees. Why did I see my maid Padma? What a cheap taste I have! -Whom did you see? -Huh? Who else? It was you! You jumped into quicksand just to save me. Thank you, Viplav. I love you. Viplav... Viplav! Viplav! Hey! Bring the rope fast. -Where is he? -There! Hey! Pass the rope fast. Here, brother. Uh... pull her, brother. She seems pretty heavy. Pull! Pull! Ptui! Bloody! Crap! Hey, stop crying. Stop it! I heard you ran in spite of his warning? Try this again and you will be dead. -Gurumurthy! -Brother? -Keep watch. -Okay, brother! -Move. -Take care! In the process of rescuing you, I had to tell a lie... Too much of slime. Why don’t you wipe it? It stinks. -Brother, brother! -Hmm? -You said there were no animals around. -Hmm. But I saw a herd of elephants on the move. -Elephants? -Ah. We have been in the forest for so long. How did you see elephants we never did? They are hardly rat pups to roam invisible. Try your tricks on someone else. Move. While I was going down... -you said something, didn’t you? -No. I said nothing. You did. I heard you. So you heard. -Why do you ask me again? -Hey... Sorry. “O Lachuvamma!” “Like the sweetness of jujubes, Lachuvammo” “How melodious is your voice, Lachuvamma!” “Like the sweetness of jujubes, Lachuvammo” “How melodious is your voice, Lachuvamma!” “O... like moonlight falling on the ripples of a stream” “Like fresh water spilling from a cool spring” “Your laughter is silvery moonlight, Lachuvamma” “How beautiful you look, O Lachuvamma!” “When you call out from the scaffold the goats grazing surround you” “Listening to your mirth, the calves rush and nestle next to you” “Withered pigeon-pea crop, Lachuvamma!” “When you start singing flowers again, Lachuvamma” “Like the sweetness of jujubes, Lachuvammo” “How melodious is your voice, Lachuvamma!” “Like the sweetness of jujubes, Lachuvammo” “How melodious is your voice, Lachuvamma!” “How melodious is your voice, Lachuvamma!” Who could be this guy? Going by his face, he must be very cruel, sir. There is no file on him in our department. Put up his posters in all the surrounding villages. Sure, sir. Announce ten lakhs prize money for the informant. Fast. Provisions are exhausting. They eat like pigs, brother. What was that sound? -Huh? -I think it’s the police, brother. Police? Hide, hide! It must be your dad. -Gurumurthy! -Brother? Be ready. Gurumurthy, stop! Brother, I have perfect aim. Let me shoot this once. Please. Hey, he is my younger brother. You want to shoot him because you could aim? Brother! Brahmanna! It’s me. Your younger brother. Stay right here. Bloody! I have been roaming the entire forest for your sake. In how many places should I look for you? Don’t you have a landmark? Don’t you stay put in one place? Brother, I am famished. I am hungry. I am parched. Water, brother! Why is water so bland? Out of five, I rate it two. Why is the apple so bitter? Out of five, my rating is one. Who is this? Why does he rate everything? This is my brother, Giri. He wanted to be a film writer or director. The film industry didn’t encourage him much. So, out of vengeance, he became a reviewer. He rips apart every film released. -They wait for a chance to finish him off. -Yes, yes! And he comes to me to escape them. Which movie was it this time? Brother, there is one Dhanunjay Reddy who is a big factionist. He cast his son and made a half baked film. The movie’s title is ‘Shunyam’. So, the film ‘Shunyam’ is exactly like its title. There is nothing in this film. Dialogues... zero. Songs... zero. Emotions... zero. Fights... zero. To talk about performances... Oh, no. oh, no! Let’s not even mention it. Shunyam... square! So, friends! The rating I am going to give this film is 0.25. Which again is not for the film. But for the popcorn I had in the interval bang. You look fine in spite of the warning! Didn’t the factionist react? You only watched this first half and think everything is fine. Hey! What are all those bruises? That’s the second half. The factionist came hunting with his gang and weapons! I escaped them and came to you. -Good that you did. Oh! Sorry. -Ouch! Who is this girl? She is only five inches shorter than the Eifel Tower. My rating for your height is five out of five. -Okay? -Hmm? You somehow seem familiar. You are the daughter of a government officer, right? Officer? What officer? Her dad is a rickshaw puller. He is no puller or driller. Her father is a famous officer. He is... actually... I saw him somewhere. I know her father very well. He is... no, no, no. It’s on the tip of my tongue. Err...ah! Your dad is a medical officer, right? -No, no. -No? -Income tax officer, right? -No, no. -No again? -She says no, brother. Let it be now. Baby? Your dad is an excise officer? Baby, your dad is a municipal officer, right? Baby, customs officer? -No. -No? Let it be! No way. It will come to me by this evening. -Crazy guy... -Just watch. -Brother! -Hmm? Wall poster from Palamuru. Got you one. Brahmanna? How come he is wanted? He is so useless and why did they announce ten lakhs prize money? Didn’t he go back home yet? No, brother. He is still in the forest. He also used our name and bought a bomb recently. I also doubt he is behind the bridge blast. Has he gone mad? Why did he blow up the bridge? Find him. Hey, check if there is police movement in this place. Okay, brother. Hey, come on! Let’s go. Brother, why are we here? Is there an ATM somewhere? ATM? You won’t find even a cycle repair shop here. What are we doing here then? Every Saturday we perform street plays and sing songs to awaken public conscious. We are doing it here this Saturday. Brother, how are we concerned with this music and drama? Let’s draw the money. Take it and send us home. Uh... I mean... look at that girl, brother. Don’t you feel pity? How anxious her parents must be? There is heavy police combing. Wait for a couple of days. I will send you myself. You... What do we do now? He is talking about some singing and playacting. No matter what happens, we will leave today. I will tell you when and how. Ah? Why does he look like Brahmanna? Not like Brahmanna. He is Brahmanna. -Ten lakhs reward if we help capture him! -Ah! -Ten lakhs? -Ah. That’s huge money, isn’t it? -Hmm. -Gurumurthy? -Brother! -We must finish the play in half an hour and get back to the forest. -Yes! -Gather the public fast. -Okay, brother. All the best, brother. I sincerely wish your play will awaken the public, brother. Thank you. You carry on, brother. We will stand at a distance and enjoy the play. Let’s go, Vasudha. Brother, this gathering and the festivity reminds me of my stage acting as a kid. Missing those days. Do you have experience in drama? Experience? Once I am on stage, people used to run home in all directions. Give me one chance, brother. -I’ll perform excellently. -Is it! Actually, why don’t you three perform a play? We? Enact? Not our cup of tea, brother. Both our faces are expressionless. Take this guy, brother. What if you leave when I perform? No, no. Both of them are staying. You know my men. They are foodies. They have no idea of acting. You are playing the DGP. You are playing the PPF leader who is out to kill the DGP. You are playing the DGP’s daughter. Yes. Correct! -Brahmanna! -Stay as you are. What is it? You made the right allotment. I remember it now. She is undoubtedly DGP’s daughter. He diverted you saying some puller or driller and they are playing around. She is definitely the DGP’s daughter, brother. -Hey, tell me the truth. -No! Hey! You are DGP’s daughter, aren’t you? -Hey, hey! Giri! -Tell me! Don’t talk rubbish. I only allotted her the role of DGP’s daughter in our play. But she is not DGP’s daughter for sure. Forget your role and act. She is DGP’s daughter for real. The trio is putting up a show before you. Stupid fellow! She is just playing a role. That’s all. -Role? -Role it is! “Only we can do this” “Hey! This is a new battle that’s precious” “Be the clang of a sword and march on” “Awake and move ahead” “Hey! This is our moment. Come down” “Come and change the destiny” “Our blood shall be our ink” “Don’t be a fawn I say get up because a hunt begins” “Time to devour the tiger and be the flash that lets out a battle cry” “We own this country” “The present age is outdated” “Cry for its burial I say” “To be the ringing bell and alter history this is the right time” “Be your own army” “Yay, yay, yay” “If we remain ants, our story will become the dwelling of snakes” “Forsake your sleep Yay, yay, yay” “When we fight like army ants Even the biggest serpent cannot survive” “Victory shall be ours” Hello? PPF men are in the village of Pandrimavidikota, sir. Who are you? Hello, Govind, sir. “Hey, when war pounces on you sharpen your sword and hack it, yes” “Demons who lack morality and justice are too dangerous unless decimated” “No god will walk out of the epics No warrior will drop from the sky” “Be your own new warrior god and march on ripping the darkness apart” “The five fingers on your hand can they win each on their own?” “Once you close them into a fist, won’t they write a new history together?” “With so many demons preying on our souls” “Be the leader who guides the infant war” (sobbing) Vasudha! What’s wrong? -Dad... -Please, don’t cry, Vasudha. Get up, Vasudha. Please! Don’t disturb the artist. She is still immersed in her role. Even after ten years, whenever we talk of drama, we shall remember you, dear. You lived brilliantly in your role. Superb! -Superb! -Oh! My silly Brahmanna! She felt you really killed her dad and got emotional for real. This is no drama. Only drama she plays here is that she is not the DGP’s daughter. -Am I right? Isn’t it true? -What’s your problem? You call it a drama and then you say it’s not. Why can’t you simply accept things? Go and appreciate the girl. -Rate her performance. Go. -Hey, brother. Not the girl. I must appreciate you for surviving so long with your chicken brain. Fine. Do the hell you want. I have a film release this Friday. Let me go and give my review. Bye. See you. Get going. Bye, DGP’s daughter. You are, right? Am I right? See, she has agreed. She nodded her head. Did you see? -You won’t! -Fantastic! I wonder what he is going to do in the forest with all his hair. It’s all fate. Treat a character like a character. Why does he act so dogmatic? Let me tell you this. From today, I am your brother. I am always there when you have a problem. She got tired with all the acting. Take her to the pial. She will take some rest. Meanwhile I will make a short speech to the public. Why a short one? Give a long speech. We will wait. You don’t have to be anxious. We understand your problems. We shall fight on your behalf. Hey, what are you doing here? Hey! Brother, eight elephants, brother. They passed by like that. Where are the elephants? Move! It’s true, brother. No one trusts me! Sir, PPF group, sir. Move, move... Why are the police shooting at us? Probably because we are in PPF uniform. Dirty idiot, all because of you. Hey, sister! Sister! What are you doing here? Come. -It’s dangerous out there. Come on. -Viplav! -They are running into the forest, sir. -Let’s go. “Will you say yes or will you say no?” Hey! Run! Police! I have a stiff back. I can’t. I can’t run anymore. Hey, I am hungry. Give me something to eat. -Are they fresh? -Fresh of course. Huh! -Hey, police! Run! -Hey! Oh, my! Hey! Run fast! I’m done! I’m exhausted. I can’t take step forward. I need at least ten minutes of rest. I can’t! There is no scope for a break, brother. Look there. Hide, hide... Bloody hell! We must retaliate! Hey, Gurumurthy! Fire! Shoot! Hey, dirty rascal! What did I say? And whom did you shoot? I aimed at them. I don’t know how you were hit. -Did you move? -Damn! Bloody! Retreat! Retreat! What did I do? Why are the police after my life? I only blew up a tiny bridge. Honestly speaking, i t’s not even a bridge. It’s a small culvert. There is no way the police would know about our street play in the village. Unless someone informs them... -Who would have done that? -We did, brother. -You? -Hmm. Why would you do that? They put up your picture on the wall announcing ten lakhs reward. When I saw that, I had a doubt. How many five hundred notes in ten lakhs? Hmm... about hundred. What do you mean hundred? Senseless fellow. Minimum three hundreds of five hundred bills make ten lakhs. -Three hundred? -No way. What is your bet? To know the number of five hundred bills in ten lakhs, we should have the ten first. That’s why we called the police from the landline in a grocery shop. But what is the use, brother? We couldn’t find the answer. To check the number of five hundred bills in a million, -you decided to hand me over? -Hmm. Useless fellows! -Brother, Brahmanna! -What is it? I came to know where the DGP’s daughter is, brother. Really? Where is she? Araku...in Haritha Vanam cottage, in Room No. 503 brother. -In the Araku? -Yes. What fresh news you have brought just like your face! -Congrats! -Thank you, brother. You people start now. -Antony! Drop them safe in Araku. -Okay, brother! What about our money, brother? No need. Instead of killing the CI, kidnapping the DGP’s daughter, will give us more mileage with Gopanna. So, we are kidnapping DGP’s daughter. -And we will give her as gift to Gopanna. -Yes! Super idea, brother. Brother, thanks a lot. The plan is terrific. Follow it to the letter as it is. Bye, bye! Stop! Address me as ‘brother’ just once, dear. Brother? Tell dad I asked after him. Ask him not to pull rickshaws at this age but take rest. Summer is approaching. Tell him to drink butter milk. Okay, brother. Take care, dear. Each time we get ready to leave, someone makes an entry. Who is this guy now? Gopanna! Ah! Gopanna! Brahmanna! I underestimated your caliber and insulted you. I made a mistake asking you to go home. Please, forgive me. You saved the party’s honour by kidnapping the DGP’s daughter. DGP’s daughter... Not knowing DGP’s daughter is with you, we searched all over the forest for her. I was told she was found. Anyway, let bygones be bygones. For the mistake I made, I appoint you the commander of this area. -Commander? -Hmm. One minute... What is your dad? He is a rickshaw puller, brother. ‘She really is DGP’s daughter. The trio is putting up an act before you.’ Who? Vasudha. Not her name. What is her father? DGP... -He is not a rickshaw puller? -No. -Brother! -Don’t! -Don’t! Enough. -It’s not that, brother. This is enough for this life. You called me brother and cheated me. That’s enough. What’s with you, Brahmanna? Why didn’t you kill the girl as soon as you found her? Why did you wait so long? Kill her?! Go that way. You go this way. Brother! Take our men to the town immediately. -Some issue there again. -Sir! You have directly come to station! Why are you here, who sent you? I’m asking you, answer me! Sir, he is the one who kidnapped your daughter. Hey! Tell me where my daughter is. Tell me! Speak or I will kill you! Uncle! I am also a travel vlogger like Vasudha. I am a close friend of hers. -I came here to speak to you. -Yes, sir. These two were in the video your daughter had uploaded. Why didn’t you bring her then? Is she safe? Uncle, to explain everything, I need five minutes of your time. Please, listen to me once. Bother! I agree what her father did was unfair. But it is the DGP you want. -I will bring the DGP, brother. -Huh? Please, brother. Don’t harm her. Fine. Leave the girl here... and bring her father. If something happens to Vasudha, I cannot bear it. It’s my life that Gopanna wants. I am ready to die. Let’s go. Sir! Don’t get emotional. Let’s look for an alternative. Hey! My daughter is in a dangerous situation there and you want me to wait for ideas? -I am going. -Sir! Don’t follow me! It’s an order. Let’s go. -What happened then was... -Hmm. Exactly... Hey, did you return the phone? What is this? What happened to you? Did you heed my words when I told you? Now when I went to give the phone, they beat me like a dog before leaving me. Anyway, your life is over. The person you have done all this for, Vasudha, is leaving for Delhi. -Let’s go. -Wait, wait. Let’s go on my bike. Why do you want to take risk, sir? Go home. I told you I am retired and am free. I have no work. Let’s go. Tell me what happened next. I am really tensed. Sir, I am driving, sir. The guy behind you is free. Ask him. Hey! Tell him. This is because of you, uncle. You invited them for a peace meeting and killed all their leaders. Why are you so angry with them? Of course I am angry with them because they killed many police personnel. But I am not such a coward to call them on the pretext of peace talks and kill them. Probably, you think we live in the forest and so we’ll believe anything you say. How many of our brothers have you encountered? Definitely, you are the reason for our leaders not coming back. He came with us ready to die for his daughter. I don’t think he would lie swearing to his daughter. Brahmanna, I have a plan to save him and Vasudha, -if you agree. -Why would I agree? I can’t betray my party or Gopanna. You called Vasudha your sister. You said you will be the first one to respond when she has a problem. Were they all lies? I have an idea that can save sir and Vasudha without harming your people. What is it? Why did you bring us here? Brother, just now the DGP fell into the quicksand and died. What do you mean the DGP fell into the quagmire? What happened? Initially, the DGP agreed to come to you for the sake of his daughter, brother. But half way in, I think the thought of death scared him. He pushed us and tried to run away. In the process of running, he fell in here. We tried hard to pull him out but we could get only this from his hand. He couldn’t get out. That was what had happened, brother. The DGP died as you wished. Umm...please send Vasudha and we’ll leave. Is my dad no more? I don’t want to live without him. Hey! What is this? Doesn’t it work? Please, someone give me a gun that works. Please! Vasudha! Don’t get emotional and do something stupid. Your dad is alive. This is a plan to save you. Drama. Huh? Really? Then, let’s go. Gopanna, bye. What did you tell her? She instantly stopped crying and is ready to go? I consoled her, brother. Watch me console her again. From one expression to another, there should be a small transition in between. Maintain that. Kindly don’t get us all killed. Please. So, we will make a move, brother. I smell something fishy. You are playing some game. You tell me, Brahmanna. Promise on the gun which is the breath of our movement and tell me. Yes, brother. He told you the truth. The DGP really died falling into this mire. -Hey, why did you come here? -Sir, please. -I told you not to come here. -I came so that I can help you in some way. -Sir, please let me stay. -Shh... shh. Hello, brother. If you ask me, it’s the same answer. Just copy and paste. He was sucked in just before we came. There were bubbles too. Why would I ask you the way I asked them? He is behind the tree, brother. That gun works. Hey, DGP! Come out! Otherwise, you will become the reason for your daughter’s death. Come out! Gopanna! Don’t shoot! I am coming. Gopanna, don’t hurt my daughter. It’s me you want to kill, right? Shoot me. Let her go. Please, Gopanna. How much you love your daughter! You beg me like a kid. If you would same concern for the poor, If he had done good, you wouldn’t have killed our leaders. I have been waiting for the moment when I would kill you. I know you won’t believe anything I say right now. Please, let my daughter go. Brother, he is here. Please, leave her as you agreed. You go. You come. Dad! Don’t go. Please, dad. Nothing will happen to me. Don’t cry. I will come home. You leave this place first. Govind! Take her. None of you move. Hey, idiot! Didn’t I tell you there are elephants? See the size of the herd. This is your gun. Gopanna, I want them both to live. I will do anything for it. You go ahead. -What about you? -I told you I will come. You guys leave, first. -No, Viplav. Please. -Brahmanna! What is this? Yes, brother! Let them go. We are only focused on killing the DGP. We stopped thinking how we can help people. Whatever happened has happened. Send them away now. It’s not safe for us to stay here, dear. Listen to me. Let’s go. All units come in. Come in. Come in. Gopanna and his gang shot our DGP. -Come with the battalion immediately. -Okay, sir. Move! Sorry, sir. I had to shoot you to kill them all. Twenty years of vendetta, sir. I think I was eight years old. They shot my father dead right before my eyes. My dad wanted to earn wealth for me. He did some illegal mining for that. So, should he be killed? To make sure none of them stays alive, I worked hard and became an IPS. As soon as I joined the department, government proposed peace meetings. What if the peace meetings are successful? I knew what I aspired for wouldn’t happen. So their leaders who came for the peace meeting... Why are you bothered about what happens to the poor? Huh? To fight for the rights of the poor, who are you? Sir, unless I kill you now, government will not take them seriously. Please! They will hold peace meeting or some other meeting. -Sorry, sir. -Please, no. [ENGLISH SONG PLAYING] Fire! “Look at the fire...making the sky brighter” You must tell my people to stop shooting. Stop! Hold it! Stop! Stop! Hold it! Stop! Gurumurthy! Shoot! Yes! Thanks to a few such people, the poor get some justice in this country. Otherwise, no leader would think twice about devouring the public. Take them, brother. Get him! We’ll show him who we are and what principles are. How are you, father-in-law? Why does he call me that? I mean... dad... one second... Why is your friend falling on my feet? That’s his character, sir. Very cheap. He doesn’t have shame or inhibition. He does whatever he wants. Come, dad. -What is it, dear? -Nothing. -What does he want? -Nothing. You come. What happened, brother? How unfair! I fought for her. I saved her dad. Even then she refuses to marry me unless I get three million subscribers. Three million? It’s impossible. Forget her. -Is it them? Is she the girl inside? -Vasdha! Stop the car! -Stop, stop! -Stop the vehicle! Sorry, Vasudha. What I did was wrong. But you want to leave me for it and- How can you say that, boy? After doing so much good for them, how can you not call it wrong? Hello. Probably, you think he has no one. I am here for him. By the way, why did you hit my boy this morning for no reason? -Hello! Who are you? -Hey! Prasada Rao. Retired bank employee. She left him saying she won’t marry him unless he gets 3 million subscribers. He told me the whole story. -He didn’t tell you what followed? -What happened? Read it out! Home Minister appreciates young YouTuber! What? It was you? Congratulations! Why didn’t you tell me? Not so fast. -Do you know what actually happened? -What happened? There was a peace meeting again yesterday under the Home Minster. Is that a new phone? Whose is it? You are pressing lots of buttons! -Home Minister’s. -Home Minister... Oh! Home Minister’s? How did you get it, brother? I stole it during the peace meeting today. Dear, Mr Viplav! Your videos are great. -All the best for your future. -Hey! Thank god. Home Minister posted the tweet. Now I will have subscribers in a flow. My foot! If they come to know, they will kill you. That’s why, tell them you found it and return it as soon as possible. Me? As she said, I had to go personally ...and literally beg him. So this guy was not arrested. Oh! Are you supporting such a guy? Support... in the sense... -You come with us, first. -Sir, sir! Won’t you say anything? Sir, you are retired and idle at home. Go to the police station and have fun watching for two days. -It’s a good timepass. - Sir, sir! -Come on... Sir, i got it, i’ll never ask for flashback. Don’t look at me as if I were a cockroach, Vasudha. After the Home Minister’s tweet, subscribers increased multifold. Actually, I am greater than you who don’t have a YouTube account. What do you mean I don’t have account? Oh! You don’t know, do you? When we met last time, I deleted your account without your knowledge. -Vasudha, please! -Hey, stop! Vasudha! It’s my channel, please be careful! Hi, guys! I am Vasudha Varma and welcome to my channel. Do you know where I am today? In Pattaya! There is a beautiful sea behind me. And also beautiful, beautiful waves. So... Vasudha! Don’t mention waves so light. Say ‘heaving waves’. There should be some drama. Why do you do this? One minute, sister. First, learn to hold this properly. You can make corrections later. When will you learn? Stop talking to yourself, and hold it proper. Hmm, ready. Okay, you guys! We will be exploring lots of different places... and meeting lots of different people. I hope you are ready because I am. You know where I am in? Pattaya!
