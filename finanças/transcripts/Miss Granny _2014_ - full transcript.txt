If you compare a woman to a ball, then a woman in her teens is a basketball. To get the ball high up in the air, every man reaches for it as hard as he can. A woman in her 20's is a rugby ball. Several men attack the ball like dogs trying to take possession of it. This is the only time in life a man will risk his life for a ball. A woman in her 30's is a ping pong ball. The number of men going after the ball is significantly reduced, but the amount of attention paid to the ball is still decent. A middle-aged woman is a golf ball. There's only one man for one ball, and the man tries to send the ball as far away as he can. And beyond that... ...she's a dodge ball. [MISS GRANNY] (a.k.a. Suspicious Girl) "Ageism: Discrimination against seniors" Give me one stereotype of elderly people that pops into your head and the reason for it. The person with the best answer... will be exempted from the midterm paper. Wrinkles and liver spots. Old people have a lot of them. Tapgol Park. Old people hang out there often. Furnace. They need one for the winter. Turtle. They're so slow. Musty smell. My grandma really does stink. They're thick-skinned. They're shameless about anything. Wow, you guys are so cruel. You think you'll be forever young? I'm not getting old. I'm going to kill myself before I hit my 30's. Why live till your 70's and have a sloppy life? That was me... I was gonna die when I hit 30. But I had me a baby. Just a year after I got married. My husband got himself killed in a coal mine in Germany. How could I die when I had a newborn to take care of? I don't know why you eloped with that fop. I told you them dandies got a short life. But my baby Hyun-chul has done well. That's right! He's a university professor. Not just any university! He's a seniors' problem expert at a national university. Sure is! Prof. BAN talked to the district chief and helped us set up this seniors' cafe. What happened to the doctor-son's granny? That shrew been going around alone without her. You haven't heard? Her son sent her away to a nursing home. She's been sane? She done raising her grandkids, so she's no good to them no more. You see? A doctor-son ain't nothing! Only a decent man like my baby Hyun-chul... "My baby Hyun-chul", "my baby Hyun-chul"... I'm sick of hearing that name. Don't come calling my baby's name with that filthy mouth. In our BAN family, my baby Hyun-chul is the most successful man after UN Secretary-General BAN Ki-moon. Is that so? Then why does your great son let you go around in those raggedy shoes? Sweetie, take a look at this! I took a passport photo. Don't I look pretty? You want one? - You look pretty! - Right? Doggone it! That wrinkly thing woulda look best at her funeral! You going somewhere? You know my son lives in America. He said he's sending plane tickets for me to come over. Sweetie, I'll have American coffee. "American" coffee? This woman wants "American" coffee! She meant caffe americano... Stop it now. Please make her a cup of coffee. No thanks. I don't want a smelly old woman making my coffee! What's that smell? I smell a rotting skull! A rotting skull? You think powdering your wrinkly face a little makes you all pretty? I'm older than you. You ain't got no respect! - Ms. Mal-soon! - Help, sweetie! - Are you crazy? - Ms. Mal-soon... - ...please stop! - Let go of me! I'll get my name engraved on her dead skull today! Please stop! Today is your funeral, bitch! Oh yeah? I'll take you down with me! - It was Mrs. OH again, wasn't it? - No, it wasn't. Why are you so nice to her? I know you used to work as her servant, but you're not, anymore. - If I were you, I would've kicked... - Kicked what?! Don't you be talking back to your daddy like that! You're gonna die an old maid? Stop living off your daddy! You're here. Sure. Now that your nose got so big, you almost look handsome. I think you should apologize first! Why did you butt in? Where you going? "Ahyeondong Princess" is airing soon! What's wrong with her? I bet she was mean from birth! You don't know nothing about her. Ms. Mal-soon is the kindest woman I know! This is why I'm not getting married! I'm scared that I might end up with a mother-in-law like her! You mean little bitch... Is that why you been paying for them dating services? Seeing you home at this hour means your date left again after a quick coffee. You ain't getting young! If you don't want to raise someone else's kid, wake up! Where are you going now? Ms. Mal-soon, I'll take you home! What's this? Are they even friends? How can she not know that my dad is allergic to peaches? You shoulda stopped me after I kicked her butt. Why did you only butt in after I got my ass slapped? You went taking her side? It's a nice breeze! Hold on tight, I'm gonna speed up! Geez, even a toddler can go faster than this! Hit the gas! What do you think, Seung-woo? They're the new girl group from SYJ. Aren't they cute? What's the group called? Sugar Girls. Who's next? Six Packs. Unbelievable... Don't be so cynical! "You don't sing with pretty faces You sing with your soul". You're correct, but young people don't know much about anything. Why don't I lip-sync teen idols with the voices from the Senior Citizen Music Show? That's a great idea! Let's do it? How many times I gotta teach you how to make a proper fish stew? You put the radish on the bottom and over the fish, so the sweet radish water seeps into the fish. Where're you going this early? - I have an audition. - An audition? You promised me that your music is just a hobby. Your sister studies all night long and she's still unemployed! What do you want from me now? Study? She watched TV online all night long. BAN Ji-ha, prepare to die... Mom, I'll make money with my music way before she gets a job. I didn't put up with everything to make you a mediocre entertainer! Why you gotta put him down like that? You put up with everything? You sit home all day with the money your husband brings you! Good morning, Baby boy! You go get something good to eat. Thanks, Grandma! See you later. Bye. Mother, Ji-ha is a senior in college. He needs to get a job. And what's wrong with being a singer?! Nowadays, singers get medals for promoting culture. Let me worry about the kids' education... When I was young and alone, I raised my son proper with nothing. Don't you come talking about no education with me! Why don't you go see a doctor? Honey? Yeah? Nothing. Hurry. You're going to be late for work. Mr. Professor, please have a good day! Thank you, Mother. You look fine. Don't you got anything nice to say to your husband?!

At this rate, you'll spit blood on stage! - Ji-ha, stop. - Fuck... Fuck? This is why I can't quit smoking. You think you kick ass? You and your songs suck hard too. Especially your name, "BAN Ji-ha" (Half Underground). How can you expect to get rich, when the leader's name means 'half underground'? Mi-ye! SEO Mi-ye! My grandma is a better singer than you! Hey, Mi-ye's been paying for our practice room! Shit, Mi-ye! Mi-ye, I'll change my name! You can name me! Stop touching them. If you get them dirty, you'll have to buy them. How much is it again? It's $29. How many times do I have to say it? Don't you got no summer sale? This is no mall, lady! There's no such thing as the summer sale. I go look around again... You came around 3 times already. You won't find anything cheaper! Ae-ja! Where she go with the door open? Mom! Mom! Mom, open your eyes! [OPERATING ROOM] Lordy, what's going on? Honey, are you all right? What? You want water? Mother... What? Say it again. - Mother... - Mother? What about Mother? She wants to see me? What's wrong? I'm here. Mother... Yeah? She wants you outside. Don't worry. The surgery went well. Thanks again. If you don't want to be a widow, take good care of your wife. If she gets worse, she'll need open heart surgery. How do I take care of her? Send her to her parents for a few months to get some rest. She needs good food and rest. Her parents are gone. My father-in-law passed away last year. If she gets too stressed out again, it won't be good. Don't you care about Mom? Don't you know Grandma almost killed Mom? But you can't send Grandma to a place like that! What's wrong with a nursing home? The service quality of nursing homes is excellent these days. Old people actually prefer to live in nursing homes. Banana. If it's so great, why don't you go live there? Grandma? Hello, Mother! Where have you been? Your favorite show is about to come on... Mother? Mother? Where's Ji-ha? He says he's busy with practice. Mother... Please have more steak. You eat some more. I'm full already. You too, eat some more. As soon as Ae-ja gets better, I'll come and get you right away. Be good to your wife. Now that she won't have me to blame for anything. Oh no! This steak is gonna burn to a crisp! Excuse me! We need a new grill here! What's wrong? If you're sick, go home and rest. Isn't your daughter-in-law still very ill? Oh my God! Mal-soon, it is you! Who...? From Wangshimini Food Market... Don't you remember me? No, I don't... How could you not remember me? I live very well-off, all thanks to you. Did you come here to thank Ms. Mal-soon? Thank her? Yes. A huge amount of gratitude in fact! When you and your newborn son had nowhere to go, my mom took you in and gave you a job at her restaurant. Now, you remember? That's right! It's me, Oh-bok! The first daughter of the Shinheung Fish Soup Restaurant... ...that you put out of business! You got the wrong person... I don't think so! My mom saved you from dying and you stole her secret recipe and opened up a new restaurant in the same market! I gotta get going... You can't leave yet! When I heard about your whereabouts last night, I couldn't sleep at all! Stop it now. I gotta get home. You're not going anywhere! We've got a lot of catching up to do! I prayed day and night to see you again! Move! My mom collapsed from stress! She called out your name until the day she died! Please stop! Let go of me! This isn't fair! - No one knows what that woman put us through! - Miss Mal Soon, are you okay? Fine... Curse me all you want or spit at me, why don't you? My baby got so sick and couldn't even nurse... I raised him on my own with everything I got. My baby is a professor at a national university. Nobody raised her baby more proper than me! That's why my baby is so good to me. Do you understand?! "A good person's recommendation is right!" "My Baby BOY" Hi, baby... Grandma, I'm hungry. Why didn't you come to dinner? I didn't want to talk to Dad or Hana. Don't be like that. You be good to your daddy. And don't fight with your sister. Grandma, I want some fried chicken. Fried chicken is too greasy. I know a good chicken soup place. Chicken soup? OK, cool. Can I bring my friends with me? Of course, baby. Your friends are all my grandsons, too! Okay, Grandma... I'll see you at 8 PM in Hongdae Station. Okay. [Forever Young Portrait Studio] Make sure you make yourself look really beautiful or I won't take your photos. That photo outside, is that Audrey Hepburn? Yes. What's that movie with a princess and a man hitting it off? Are you talking about "Roman Holiday"? Right! "Roman Holiday". She's the prettiest actress I know. Yes. How old you think she is now? If she were alive today, she would be about 85. Audrey Hepburn is dead? Yes, for about 20 years now. Geez... I bet when you were young, you were as pretty as Audrey Hepburn. When I was young, I was quite famous among men in Boseong as the last daughter of rich Mr. OH. I sure could sing. One time, a theater director heard me sing and begged me to debut. He said I got the voice, the face and the body, or something like that. You still look beautiful. That's why I'm gonna take me a photo now before I go more ugly. Putting up a bad portrait at a funeral ain't no good. You should look presentable. I never powdered my face when I was young. But now, I pretty up for a funeral portrait. I'll make you look 50 years younger. That's sweet of you to say. Okay, on three. One, two, three! [Forever Young Portrait Studio] "To Hongdae Univ." Thanks for stopping! Look at her style! Lordy! I'm burning up! Are you going clubbing? To which club? What's the dress code tonight? Vintage? You talking to me? You're funny. That's cute. Huh? Did you call me cute, young man? Are you older than me? You look so young. I was born in 1990. Are you a child of the 80's? Mine starts with a 4... 4? You're in the fourth-year? I'm a senior too! We're both in the fourth-year! ♪ 4 plus 4 is cutie pie! ♪ ♪ 5 plus 5 is... ♪ ...is 10, you rude bastard! Why you wearing sunglasses in the middle of the night? I got them done in Gangnam... That ain't too good... Don't move! Good Lord! - Mister, give me anxiety medication! - Yes... Miss, are you all right? Do I look like a young girl to you, too? What? How old you think I am? Twenty? How about you? Pardon? Don't lie to me or I'm gonna rip that mouth of yours! Nineteen? Dear Lord! What's happening to me? Lordy! Lordy! ...your call will be transferred to voice-mail. Grandma? That's weird. The phone is turned off... [Chungun Chinese Restaurant] This is the right place... Lady, let me ask something... Yes? Wasn't this place a photo studio? Does it look like a photo studio? Then... You know Forever Young Portrait Studio around here? Darn sure it's around here. Miss, I opened this Chinese restaurant 10 years ago and there are no photo studios around here. That ain't no good! This is the right place! Young ones these days don't know how to thank others... Lordy... This is the place! Ms. Mal-soon never got home last night? She didn't come here? Tell me straight! Why is she gone? Did you call her? I've called her all night long but she's not answering. She was supposed to meet Ji-ha last night. Maybe she collapsed somewhere? You know they send old people on the streets to some shady countryside nursing homes these days! Mrs. OH didn't collapse. That's impossible! Even dogs would laugh at that! Then she's been kidnapped! Who would kidnap an old woman? She'll probably kill herself before she let anyone pay even a penny for ransom. That's why I'm worried! Prof. BAN... If you don't have enough for the ransom, you come to me. I'll sell this house to save Ms. Mal-soon! Sell the house? What about me? You want me to live with the dog in the dog house? How can you not care about your daughter at all? Shut your trap! You called the police? The police say I can't report a missing person until after a few days. What if something bad happens to her in those few days?! No! Stop eating so much! Her forehead's so fat, the egg won't even crack! That lazy bitch... That's why you ain't getting married. I'm too old for this... Lordy... What's happening? I ain't hurting no more... Girl... Youth is the greatest gift. She looks like a rubber ball! That's nothing... Look at her bend. She's like an octopus. If she's an octopus, I'm a penis fish! Move... It's amazing how much your stomach pops out! "99 Missed Calls" You wanted to kick me out. Why you calling me now? That's right. God taken pity on me. Instead of me dying old and alone... God gone given me another chance. "Ahyeondong Princess" Are they human or broccoli? Hello, cutie pie! Let me have a bite of that little wiener! Snap! Yummy! You need room and board? How did you hear about my house? From the flyer outside. I took that down a long time ago. I seen it a long time ago. You get breakfast and dinner. It's $500 a month. Good God! You think I'm a fool?! I know you got paid $400 before! I'll cook myself. I think $300 is more than enough for the room. It gets the best sunlight and the previous girl you had before left the dressing table. Have you been to my house before? Now I think about it, you look familiar... People come and go and talk... Dad. We got a new one. What's your name? It's... My name is... Aud... rey? Audrey? Ms. Mal-soon's favorite actress is Audrey Hepburn. Audrey? Doo-ri! OH Doo-ri. Doo-ri like CHA Doo-ri? Which OH clan do you belong? Ms. Mal-soon is the Haeju OH clan. I'm something like that... Okay, see you later. Wait! You got to pay up front... "Have fun without me" So this is how she wants to protest against me. I'm the one who wants to leave this house... Shouldn't we call the police? You want to ruin your dad's career?

I was 13 when my parents passed away. Ms. Mal-soon's family took me in. Servant work was hard. But her smiling face was the only thing that got me going. Then why don't you recognize me? What do you mean? You said you waited day and night for that smiling face. Now you recognize? What you doing? Don't you disgrace me no more and kill me already! Lordy, you don't even remember... You must have lied! Ms. Mal-soon? Remember me now? Sure is me, OH Mal-soon! Ms. Mal-soon... So those ain't dentures but your real teeth? Sure thing! The other day, I had short ribs chewed up to the bone! I'm envious... I'm going to the TV station next week. You going to watch the Senior Citizen Music Show? Let's go together. Do I look like I'd be going to the Seniors Music Show? Come closer. I'm a singer now. A real singer on TV? That's right! A real singer! You know I always wanted to be a singer. That day you sang... ♪ Rain is falling quietly ♪ Whenever you sing that, my world stops turning! You ain't the only one! That TV producer got knocked off them feet too. He says I sing with my heart! That I have a soul! Sure you're in Seoul! Is he stupid or something? Shut up and eat this! You know Hyun-chul is real worried. I need to ask for a favor... You met my mother? You really did? Where is she now? Calm down. One at a time. When did you see her? She came like the wind and left like the smoke... She said not to worry. She wrote you a letter. This is my mother's handwriting. She stamped her seal as well. She told me she wants to live different now. She never lived her way. She asked to re-activate her credit card. Said it's inconvenient. She says she'll come back when the time is right. And she wants to tie the knot as soon as she comes back. Tie the knot? As in get married? I told you... She wants to live the way her heart tells her. With who? Who else? With me, of course! That little shit! That's hard to believe. Mr. PARK... What's hard to believe? You think I'm no good for your mother? I was her servant when I was young but you can't look down on me now! She trusts me now more than her own son! My heart is her heart and her heart is mine! Ask her! I'm sure of it. She approached him purposely. No way... I knew you looked a little slow but I didn't know that you really are dumb. This is why you're still single. Your house. It's antique. Don't you know how much it's worth? That young bitch is good with old men. She's no fool. I have to change. I have to get young. 108, 109... 110! You impressed yet? You gone crazy again? You're too darn old for this! A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. Hop on. You done good. Ms. Mal-soon, what you singing today? You come listen and you'll know. I'll sing up a good one so you just wait up there. In this segment, we introduce a new singer once every month. They'll totally blow you away in this summer heat. Yes, even the name is very cool. It's not the basement or the ground. It's half underground. Let me introduce "BAN Ji-ha Band" (Half Underground)! ♪ Do not think about... ♪ ♪ ...things that have passed ♪ ♪ Don't yearn for him ♪ ♪ He has to go ♪ ♪ Flowers wither away ♪ ♪ Don't be overwhelmed with grief ♪ ♪ The time will come... ♪ ♪ It'll bloom again ♪ [Good luck in Germany - Coal Mining Work Abroad Program] ♪ Don't be sad ♪ [Death Notification] ♪ Well, where did you go? ♪ ♪ Where does a lost traveler go? ♪ ♪ Where did it go? ♪ ♪ The white butterfly that was looking for him ♪ ♪ Flowers wither away ♪ ♪ Don't be overwhelmed with grief ♪ ♪ The time will come... ♪ ♪ It'll bloom again ♪ ♪ Don't be sad ♪ ♪ Flowers wither away ♪ ♪ Don't be overwhelmed with grief ♪ ♪ The time will come... ♪ ♪ It'll bloom again ♪ ♪ Don't be sad! ♪ Okay, so she can sing a little. Mom, should I become a singer too? Mr. PARK! Did you have fun? Mr. PARK, if you're tired, please go to the sundeck and lie down. You don't look too well. You look awful terrible! There's them hot tubs. Go there! No thanks! I don't ride slides because they ain't no fun. Don't they got anything fun here? That will do! I used to go diving in the middle of a typhoon to go gather them shells! Wave is forever my friend! Why you come following me? I thought you be going to a swimming pool. Not some place like this. Ain't you showing too much skin? You impressed yet? Better turn them heads away! Don't you come looking over here! She could be your granny! Ms. Mal-soon, don't you worry! I'll protect you! Are you all right? Do you want to get out now? Yes. Ms. Mal-soon... Ms. Mal-soon... How do you feel right now? Feel what? After your TV appearance, you're the talk of the town. All the reporters are curious about you. They want interviews. I... can't. Why not? People would die for those. If my daddy finds out, he's gonna shave my head. Okay. We can talk about that later. Tell me about yourself. About what? I'm very curious about you but I don't know anything. Just takes time. Go little by little. Don't you think it's fate that we met again? Maybe... What's wrong with your foot? Did you get hurt? You're bleeding. Are you okay? Let me take a look... It ain't nothing! I'm gonna get me some ointment. Don't you worry about me. Wait... Don't you worry! You only get one chance! Dang! You get old when you bleed! There's a way to go back to your old self! You wanna go back? What the... Get out of here right now! What you doing? What did we do? It's the middle of the night! We? Dad, you should be ashamed of yourself! Do you know how old you are? She could be your granddaughter's age! What're you doing with her? Bitch... why don't you just get naked? Bitch? Who you calling bitch? Then should I call her stepmother? You got us all wrong! Dad, are you insane? You... Don't you have anything better to do than to seduce an old man? How could you speak like that! You keep your mouth shut! Lordy.. PARK, you hold back. - PARK? - You little shit... Did you just call him "PARK"? Mommy! Please take Daddy with you! He has lost his mind! Why do I have to live like this until now? Why do you have to die and make me take care of father? Where you going? I'll call ya. If you call him, I'll have you locked up! Stop it! You cry like your mom! Mommy! I never got married because of Mom's wishes. How could you do this to me? Mommy! Don't you put up a show! You always went on dates on your mom's memorial day! Where you going in the middle of the night? Don't go, Daddy! Let go! You're gonna rip my pants! That girl really is your mother! I know it ain't easy but you gotta believe me. So when you said that you met my mother, you were talking about that woman? Yes! That girl is my Ms. Mal-soon. Your mother! Sir... You got me now? It's early, so I'm sure there's a way. That's right. There are still a lot of ways. Blood! We need to draw blood! Yes, blood. I have a college friend who works at the university hospital. I'm going to call him and ask... Prof. KIM, it's me. I have a question. I know someone who's about 70 years old. I don't know whether it's depression or dementia but it comes and goes. He could have both? How much did you spend on her? Get out of here! If you've handed her the property deed, I'm going to sue! Hello? Hi, it's me, Seung-woo. Why didn't you answer my calls all day? Is everything okay? Actually, there is... Hello? Doo-ri, are you all right? Wow, this is amazing! Geez... You got a good house. You own this house, Producer Han? No, it's a rental. It sure looks expensive for young people to buy. Can I ask something? Sure. You got a good home and a good job. And you look... Look what? You look good. Why ain't you married yet? Who said that I'm not married? Then you are? No! But it feels good to see you get surprised. Your mom must have worried sick about you. You all grown up living like this. All moms worry about that. She passed away. When I was a baby. Doo-ri, do you have a boyfriend? It's been a while since my husband died. I have a son who is all grown up and gotten married. I lived with an old widow who likes me. Doggone it. I got me into a fight with his daughter. Okay, I lose! From now on, I'll never joke around you! So besides a widow with a kid, what type of guys do you like? A man who puts food on the table and is good in bed... Are you okay? I'm sorry... Towel! Towel! Who are you? Geez... Why you gotten drunk when you ain't no good at drinking? ♪ Sleep, sleep my baby ♪ ♪ You go on sleeping ♪ ♪ Rooster ♪ ♪ Please don't crow ♪ ♪ You'll wake up my baby ♪ ♪ Dog ♪ ♪ Please don't bark ♪ ♪ You'll wake up my baby ♪ ♪ Sleep, sleep my baby ♪ You feeling sick again? Don't take medicine with cold water. You'll get a tummy ache. ♪ We can't hide everything ♪ What do you think? The vocalist is great, but what's wrong with the song? Did they write their own song? Guys. We can't use your song this time. I'll connect you with a songwriter. Let's go with a new song. You understand how important the next stage is. If you go ahead with this song, it could be the end. What's wrong with the song? Tell me what you don't like about it. The song that you wrote was purely created to showcase Doo-ri's style and character. Your "Life of Half Underground" was the only song worth listening to. Isn't your band's name "BAN Ji-ha Band"? Are you sure it's not "OH Doo-ri Band"? - Where you going? - Don't follow me! What's wrong? The producer is only saying that to help us. You can write new songs later. I heard you slept with Producer Han. What? Did you? You little shit! Where you gone learning those filthy words? Fine, I did. I slept! He had them good air-condition! I sure did! He had good air-condition! I slept real good! I been too nice! Get up! Go on and eat up. Why are you doing this to me? It's them dog days today! What's wrong with eating chicken to fight them heat? Hurry and eat up! My arm's fixing to fall off! Geez, you don't eat too good these days. You have to take care of yourself. Are you really dating Producer Han? You really like me? I'm sorry... but you... ain't my type! You can't even confess your love like a real man! You ain't good at keeping business and personal stuff separate! You make people around you suffer! And also... one thing I don't like most about you is it's that you don't know what a good person you are. Aww... My Ji-ha. You look even more handsome when you smile. Hey, who are you really? Me? I am... the lead vocalist of "BAN Ji-ha Band"... OH Doo-ri! How you been? I seen you on TV but you never called. I got lots to think about. You like someone? How you know that? How many years I seen you. You like him too? It been so long that I wasn't sure what it was. But my heart's beating like crazy. You do like him. I'm jealous of him. Take this. It's the peach season. They're awful sweet. Thanks... Anyway, what happened to that shrew? Haven't seen her around. Thought she's gotta drink them "American" coffee every day. She had a stroke few days ago. What happened? We're at that age where tomorrow might never come. But you don't have to worry about that, though. That's a great song. You're home? Did you write that? Are you drunk? Keep up the good work. See you. Is this the girl who came over to our house? Yes... why? Nothing. ♪ Come to me, quietly ♪ ♪ Come over here ♪ Guys, I did it! What? For the next summer special concert, they want to play my song! Really? They've finally recognized the genius songwriter. You did real good! Good job! Good job, good job! Good job! Y'all done good! Producer Han, you got pretty hands. Really? People say men with pretty hands are lazy. Are you worried that I'll be too lazy and starve my future wife and kids? No. No, you work hard and you're a good man. Am I good? What? As a man. Well... The problem is... The age difference is a bit... I know. I'm pretty old. No, that ain't it! I was gonna say... It starts with 4. Not 4th year uni... You smell like my mom. What? I've never met my mom, but you smell like my mom. I like your new hairstyle! Thank you. I'll wait here and take you home later. No, that ain't necessary. I'm going to take a while. You must be tired too, so please go ahead. Doo-ri. That looks pretty. Go on. What's the patient's name? I don't know her last name. Her first name is Ok-ja. Ok-ja... She came in few nights ago. Here she is, JOO Ok-ja. We'll start in 10 minutes after the rehearsal. Where's your leader? He'll be here soon. Make sure there wouldn't be any problem. Please contact him and ask him where he is right now. What's keeping him late? He fixed his guitar and is coming from the shop. I'm almost there. Give me 10 minutes. I don't think 10 minutes will do. The traffic is really bad here. Because of the concert in Jamsil Stadium... Mister, I'm getting off here. Do you think this makes any sense? We're going on the same stage as those guys. They're the ones who inspired me to play the drums. They're starting! ♪ Out of breath ♪ ♪ Out of breath ♪ ♪ Run like hell ♪ ♪ Run like hell ♪ ♪ Feel the roar ♪ ♪ from here ♪ He's not answering. Hello? Ji-ha? Where is he? Seung-woo, they're up next. You need to make a decision. I don't think you can play tonight. Why don't you go to the hospital first? Yeah, let's go... I'll be there as soon as I'm done. Let's sing. Let's go sing. Ji-ha's song. Let's sing it loud enough for Ji-ha to hear. Then let's go tell Ji-ha... that his song was awful good. Ji-ha, can you hear it? People are waiting for our song. I'll do my best to sing the song you wrote.

She went to the hospital as soon as we were done. We're heading over there now. Blood type AB Rh Negative! Does anyone have the same blood type as the patient? We're short on blood for the surgery! How can you not have blood at a hospital? We had many emergency surgeries today. We're looking around at other hospitals but it's urgent! Anyone in the family? Grandma! Ji-ha and grandma have the same blood type! What do we do now? What do we do? I have... the same blood type. The same blood type with Ji-ha. Why did you come here? What you doing? My grandson. My Ji-ha. You'll go old again if you give blood. Why you want to be old again? What's good about wrinkly face and smelly body? - I gotta go... - I thought... I thought you enjoy being a singer! I thought that man makes you happy! Let's hurry and give blood. Excuse me... Let me ask you something. Do you know the phrase "Hang in there, Baby"? Do you? A long time ago, There was a young single mother who had to raise her newborn son alone. But that newborn was very ill and wasn't getting better. Everyday, the baby went between life and death. But his mother was so poor that she couldn't do anything for her baby. So she took him in her arms and said in tears, "Hang in there, Baby" "Hang in there, Baby" "Hang in there, Baby. Hang on for dear life" "Please hang on for dear life" Let's go... Wait a minute! I'll save my son no matter what. So please go. Please just go. When you go, please don't eat from the trashcan. Don't work at the fish market. For your child, don't sacrifice everything for your child. Don't marry a man with a short life. And please don't have a bad son like me. Please go. Please. Please go, Mother! No. Even if I'm born again, I'll live my life just the way I lived before. Even if it's hard, I won't change a thing. So that... I can be your mommy. And you... can be my baby again. Mother! Baby! The name is BAN Ji-ha. He's a college kid. I had a real good dream. It sure was a fun dream.

You go on first. [Forever Young Portrait Studio] Guess that old fart taught himself some new tricks... You impressed yet? PARK? Hop on. Did you find the studio? I liked that photographer. What you gonna do now? How you going home? I ain't going back to that house. I'm free. With these wheels and gas money, I can go anywhere in the world. Stop! Let's go give blood before you get into trouble! Are you worried now that I've become young? You afraid I might leave you for a younger woman? You crazy or something?
