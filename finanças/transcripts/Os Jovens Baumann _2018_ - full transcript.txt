Too cold. It's so good! -Guys, I need to pee. -Me too! Get away! Everybody backs off to pee. Echo! Ana Paula! Ana Paula! Come to the water! Jump! You're a pain in the neck! You better be ready. -Isa, stop showing them. -Nice hand. What about the game? "Those who save, always have". Fred's philosophy. -Yes, I think it's important. -This is the philosophy of saving. -I'll save my rummy. -I save. It's our friend's turn. Jota. I'm screwed. Somebody has got to buy the discard pile. Fred, you need to help me out. We can only talk in this rhythm. Play Fred, draw a card Keep going Frederico is taking too long Frederico takes too long I play with him every time And he always takes too long He takes two hours to play We're playing rummy! Isa... I won! Did you discard? No, I will do it now. If I knew he played like this... Film my hand! "Damn you!" Whoever doesn't stop playing will suffer the terrible curse! Fred almost got in a car accident. It was a near-death experience. Do you feel like a new person after that? This is what you witnessed. A near-death experience. -And it'd be recorded. -A death. -Your first reaction was... -My only reaction was to film. -Do you feel like a different person? -I revisited all my existence. How did it change you? Did you watch a movie of your life? I did, and it was filmed by Isa. The battery will die, or maybe we will die in this car. Come on, smile for the camera. Smile for the camera, guys. You are excluding me! I'm the driver. -So cute! -Now sad. -You are all so cute. I love you. -Now with fear. Now, bored. Now... With love. Love. Love is hard. Love is very hard. What does love look like? -Behold, a tree branch! -What are you doing? How big was the joint you smoked? I don't want to kill the tree. Be careful! These were the Baumanns. Cousins and heirs of the most important family of Santa Rita d'Oeste, in the South of Minas Gerais state. They were the owners of this farm, which once was the largest coffee producer in the region. As time went by, though, it had become just a summer house, with a small coffee plantation. None of them lived in Santa Rita d'Oeste. They were already children of the big cities. When they spent their vacations here, they isolated themselves in the farm, and were hardly seen by the inhabitants of the city. They had a ghostly presence. And it was like this until 1992. It was at that time that I first entered that house. I was seven, and I was with my father, who had been called to fix the plumbing. I was amazed by the scandalous kitchen tiles and the princess canopy in the girls' bedroom. I remember thinking they were the richest family in the world. But a few days later, everything changed. I woke up to the comments that something terrible had happened on that farm. But nobody knew exactly what. The young Baumanns had disappeared. After that day, the eight cousins were never seen again. Attention. These objects are evidence of one of the greatest crimes in history. The fingerprints found on these objects point to a man. Caucasian, about 5.7 ft, brown hair. His name is Tim?teo. Tito Baumann. Tim?teo, maps have been found in your room indicating an escape to S?o Paulo after the theft of the Baumann's inheritance. What's your involvement with it? None. Who else is involved? I want names. I suggest you look for Caio Baumann. The real responsible for the family's inheritance theft. I will ask again. And I expect an honest answer. What is your involvement with the theft of the Baumanns' inheritance? I didn't do it. We've come to a dead end. Over there, another young man, whose name came to our mind during the investigation. Jo?o Ot?vio. -Get out of my room. -Also known as Jotalh?o. -Jotalh?o, we need information... -Get out of my room! -Isa! -Cry baby. -The investigation must go on. -Isa! -Can I sit here, Caio? -Sure. The bonfire is so beautiful. It's so beautiful! It's important, guys. It starts like this. Here, in Minas, we believe that the word "disgrace" brings bad fruits. Tell us why. Because it attracts bad things. Bad things. So, actually, the story happened here. -Here, where? Minas? -Here, here. Grampa told me. He always tells this story. But I lived part of this story. The first inhabitants of this region, before the construction of this house, before the farm and the coffee plantation, I don't know what it was like. No, no. Not the principal. Two friends of mine from school decided to travel to Angra. And then... they like Jorge Ben a lot. -The beer is hot. -Okay. -Jorge Ben? -Jorge Ben. Okay. So... Your story reminded me a lot their story, actually. Here's what happened: They used to camp at the beach and sing: That's beautiful. These socks are too warming. They don't work out. -Are you feeling cold? -Yes. A little. But you can leave it here, for my feet. Stop filming, Isa. -Did you see the bonfire ashes? -Yes, I stepped on that little trunk. -The marks... -Fuck. Fuck. I wanted to go horseback riding today. Soon you will be better. -Where are you going? -Do you want some water? Jota, let me just rub this here. What's that lotion? -Arnica. -Arnica. It smells so good, check it out. It smells minty. Smell it, Tito. Isn't it great? In the year of 1992, the newspapers were bombarded by the disappearance of the young Baumanns. "Young heirs disappear." "Mystery in Santa Rita d'Oeste." "Search continues at the Baumann farm." While newspapers speculated on the reasons for the disappearance, the police analyzed crucial evidence of the case, a box with VHS tapes. The last records of the cousins at the farm. No theory about the disappearance of the young cousins was confirmed by the investigations. And after a while, the case was closed without solution. Over the year, the headlines about the Baumanns were replaced by more important news. "Ayrton Senna wins the Italian Grand Prix." "Prince Charles and Lady Di separate." "Brazil's President Fernando Collor is removed during the Impeachment process." By the end of 1992, the young Baumanns were a forgotten case. -Last night? -Yes. My body is all sore. Good morning. Already filming? Remember that time, that we went to the supermarket? We were very hungry, but we were out of money. And we were too ashamed to ask for our parents. Because we had spent everything on beer. And then we went to the supermarket, in France, but meat is very expensive there. We couldn't afford it for quite a while. But we wanted to eat some kind of meat. We went to the supermarket to buy processed meat, it looks like... What is it called? That chicken stuffed with cheese... I don't remember. Cordon" something. "Cordon"... -"Cordo"? -"Cordon". -"Cordo"? -"Cordon Bleu". Is it good? Yes, it is chicken breast stuffed with cheese. Then we hid it inside Isa's bag, and bought bubblegum! We just bought bubblegum! You hid in the bag the... Cordon Bleu. -How's everybody? -They're fine. Is your mom fine? -Is your father fine? -He's fine. We need to get together when we come back. Yes. There are so many insects! I hate this farm. The aliens. What do you mean? They are men from the future. -That's crazy. -But they were all killed, you see? That's why they come back once in a while. to get half a dozen koalas, pandas, anteaters. -Why did they leave the Earth? -They didn't. They go back in time, they are on Earth. -I got it. -Now everything is fine. No. -Stop moving. -I don't want to be filmed. I'll eat you. Show me what you're hiding! Down the throat. -Can you see it? -What? -There is a toucan over there. -A toucan? Where? -Over there. -Where? You just don't get it. You scared me! Come with us to a great adventure! We are here, between the water and the land. In the middle of the tropical forest! Facing unimaginable risks to any human being. Wait, aren?t these the bones of a whale? The bones of a whale that once lived here. How unusual it is. Let's go. Further on, once again we find something that surprises us. -Look. -It is some kind of fossilized egg. It indicates the existence of dragons on Earth. -Come and see. -We advise you not to touch it. Even in nature, they are at a temperature of approximately 450 *F. Which would surely burn the hand of any human being. Yes, if I touch it... It is already hot. -Be careful, my friend! -No, we better leave nature alone! It's always important to remember that men were made to live in harmony with nature. If we interfere, only God knows what may happen tomorrow. Let's go. Here! It was so mean! Peer him. Let's stop talking about it. Soon his ear will be burning. And he will come down running. No, he won't, because... Poor him. But he will yell at us from the house: "Stop talking about me! Stop, you snake!" Man, his foot is screwed. He simply cannot stand still, he just can't come here and... -Stay quiet for one second. -In peace. You will show it to him, I know. -Please! -Of course. Check the water level. There used to be four inhabited cities by the dam and they were evacuated to create the dam. Four or five cities were submerged in this process. It is scary, right? It is creepy. And to think that the farm is right here, and... The human bones... You think so? Do you think they destroyed everything? No, the water does the job. Sometimes when the water level lowers - there are pictures of it - you can see the cross of the churches. I didn't think about the Baumanns for a long time. I was very young when I left Santa Rita d'Oeste to study in S?o Paulo, where I lived for almost 20 years. But after several months without getting a job, I decided to go back to my parents' house. As soon as I arrived, they told me the old Baumanns had finally sold the farm. The family had long abandoned the place. But no one knew why they took so long to sell it. After a few weeks, my father was called to do some repairs at the Baumanns' old farm. And he asked me to come along. While talking with the new owner, I found out the Baumanns had left everything behind. Furniture, objects, even personal files. Including the VHS tapes. Not sure exactly why, I asked if I could keep the tapes. The new owner gave them to me immediately, happy to get rid of those cursed tapes. I don't see the young Baumanns anywhere. Their records are the only proof they had been here. Say hi to him. Hi, Chico. He's so whining. So whining. Let's run, people. Look. This is a dicotyledon, right? Monocotyledon. -No, there are two seeds. -I'm kidding. -It's a dicotyledon. -This is the coffee bean, look. It must be toasted. I see everything in purple, guys. I'm just... I'll put some more on your face. Wait a second. Jota, your face is red. Oops. There you go. Just like a magazine cover. Isa, you, should come to Belo Horizonte with us. Come on, Isa! Okay. I have only one month of vacation. We can do a sexy photo shoot with a ufology theme. Over the hills of Belo Horizonte. Wow. The camera got wet. Jota. A magic trick. Tito will have long hair. -Bend a little further. -He's finally handsome. He looks like Zacarias. Great! -Kinda rock star. -Kinda metal. -Bon Jovi! -Totally metal! Tito Bon Jovi! So handsome. -Now, bang your head. -He looks like Queen's guitarist. I love men with long hair. Me too! -Really? -Yes. Did you like my new shirt, Isa? Which one? Is it really yours? -Is it someone else's? -It's a secret. Aren't you gonna tell me? No? I think I've seen it before. Everything is broken! Everything is broken. It's awful. The sheets are torn, the pillows are moldy. I saw a rat in the kitchen the other day. -It's unacceptable. -Make a complaint, then. Make a complaint. Go on, ask for it. Ask for it, we'll send the tape. Well send it anywhere you want. -We can do it, if it's on Isa's tape... -How about a TV show? We should send it to a TV show. It's a complaint. A report of neglect. I think... Let me speak. It's a consequence of the land reform. It's time for the truth! The agricultural estates are disappearing. It's the land reform. These are the consequences of the land reform. Bia, shut up. -It's true! -Bia is great! There will be bums living here! There will be bums living here! Don't you want the land reform? There will be bums here. Besides the moldy pillows, the broken shower, there will be bums living in this property. There will be bums in this living-room. There will be bums drinking beer with us. Bia is talking non-sense for Christ's sake. As I watch these tapes, I start to remember the summer of 1992. The fact that the Baumanns and I have been in the same space. How everything seemed easy and fun to them, while to me, it was uncomfortable being in a place that seemed so fancy and grandiose. They have always been the Baumanns. The most important family of Santa Rita d'Oeste, family with a history. The history of coffee. Maybe the young Baumanns didn't want or didn't like that. But they would forever be the last generation of the family. So adorable. I remember one time, we went for a ride at the coffee plantation. We always ride slowly, you know? Passing through the plantation rows. But this time, I don't know, we were riding and suddenly he started to run very fast. I thought he wanted to show me something, you know? I didn't try to stop him. I just held tight as he sped by the plantation rows... Suddenly he stopped in a spot I had never been to in the farm. A large open field. You could see the road from there. We stopped, and when I saw it, I had the feeling we should leave this place. Leave the farm, you know? And run far away from here. But I guess I didn't have the courage. So I came back. Now every time I come here I get sad, because I see him confined to that fence and here we are, as we've always been. Say it again. -Now you don't to want to... -Now it's time for the grilling. You love Ana, huh? She is your friend. I am your friend. That one isn't, you see? She made fun of you. What? -What did she say? -She said it to your face. -What did she say? -Don't pretend you don't know. -Now she didn't say anything... -I don't know. -Talk more about Fred. -I said you look like a dike. Film her. That was so mean. Stop it, guys. -Stop it. -For real. Tap your cigarette ash, please. Did you get offended, really? Me? No, no. Come on, guys, this is so high school. Enough, Isa. What a terrible rain! Have you fed the dogs? Look at the sun. I couldn't be happier. Everything will be flooded. When the dogs get disoriented, they start chasing nothing, you know? It looks like they are chasing... ghost sheep. I always think about that. That they are chasing imaginary sheep. The young Baumanns will disappear at any moment. I still don't know what happened. Or how it happened. Perhaps these tapes are the last breath of an entire family that, without their heirs, doomed to disappear. I keep asking myself if they knew how their disappearance would affect the family. Did they know they were going to disappear? I also wonder if these tapes had any purpose, or if like so many others, they are just records of young people on vacation. And among those images, one last tape stands out, presenting me a possible epilogue. -So pretty! -Did you like my outfit? I loved it. So? Here. Here. One, two, three. -Do you want to dance, Caio? -Are you asking me to dance? Well, you will not ask me. Is it better? Better than the last time? -Is my partner going to like it? -You're more relaxed. -Are you still good? -You know I'm a great dancer. Everything is loose. It's every man for himself. Everything is messy, adrift. Everyone is immersed in their own things and nobody does anything. What was it? -What? -A noise. It was just an animal, Ana Paula. -An animal? -Yes. -Didn't you hear it? -Let's go. Caio. I heard it, it came from there. -Forget it. -It came from there. Caio? Fred, did you see it? No. Now. Hey, dog. Excuse me, my friend. Ready? Go! THE YOUNG BAUMANNS Hardsubs transcript by gooz
