CIVIL WAR LEE SURRENDERED POVERTY BY CIVIL WAR, AND FACING THE HARD WORK OF RECONSTRUCTION, THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS CUT OLD TIES AND TAKEN THE TRAIL OF IMMIGRANTS TO THE FREE LANDS OF THE FAR WEST FOR A NEW BEGINNING ... What is it, Lucy, don't you like it? I can't believe it's real. After all we've been through. What does that mean? New land, new hope. New Hope. You couldn't have chosen a better name for him. O New Hope Valley. PONY EXPRESS Branch Station Now, why hasn't he arrived yet? Just got lost, I suppose. Now now. Finally arrived. Alright by the way. He must have stopped to pick daisies. Good luck, boy. - You better stay tuned and run! - I will stay. Any sign of Pony Express, Stevie? Not yet, grandpa! It should arrive at any time. It's coming now, grandpa! Are you sure you're riding! Pony Express. There he comes! Make way for Pony Express! Hi, Tony? - Stevie Braddock? - I'm Major Braddock. - That was dispatched to you, sir. - Thanks. Attention everyone! To the citizens of this community, in celebration of the founding of the New Hope Valley 50 years ago, Stevie Braddock, I have the honor and declare a holiday in celebration of the jubilee anniversary , which is now official. Good news, Tony. I admit that I couldn't have come at a better time. Thank you, Major. - We almost caught you, didn't we? - Nice outfit, Stevie. Our! You really look like Indians in these clothes. Well, guys. It looks like our Poney Express boy has struck the dinner bell. I think we will have to entertain ourselves until the women have dinner ready. - I think we can wait. - But I hope it won't be long! Not eu! - Hi, Tony. - Hi, Betsy. Oh, I'm so sorry. - What are you doing here? - Catching snacks. - I thought I could help. - And can. - Getting out of my way. - Ah, Celia. Look, this is a woman's job. Go and keep your two friends company. - They're not here yet. - You better hurry. Don't worry, they'll show up before you set the table. - Hello. - What made you delay this time? After that race, I had to stop and let the horse rest. Well, come on then. My stomach is thinking that my mouth is closed for renovations. I follow you. That was close. - Hello. - Hello, sorry, Mr. Proctor. - It's all right. Hello son. - Hello. Mr. Gilbert, you would be happy to meet Smith and Johnson. - How is it going? And thank you. - You're welcome. Forget. Do you two also come for the celebration? That's right. Today is the big day, isn't it? I think you better put your horses to rest. - See you later. - Okay, see you later. Today is a great day to give you bad news. Well, we can't help it. Hey, guys. - Hi, Stevie, have you started yet? - The boys are dancing. Well, let's go. Well, not bad. I've seen better. Excuse me, gentlemen. It seems that the children understood the spirit of the thing. Let's see if we can do the same. I'm the type who likes to choose who will dance with me. My chosen one has to be smart. - And a little crazy too. - Oh, really? Your talkative. Hello, dear. Blondes aren't even my type. Pony boy! - Think like a man. - Where were you? - I was busy. - But I was looking for you. Everything is fine. Look. We would be here sooner, but he was busy in a bust. He did that? Oh, how wonderful! But you know, it was just me, me and Tucson. - He's just being modest. - Come on, tell me what happened? Look ... the ... horses ... See you, Pony Boy. I stood side by side and grabbed the side reins of the buggy and pulled the horses from death and stopped them! - And they stood still. - Wonderful. Listen, guys, the next dance will be Tag Dance. All right, guys. Dinner is ready. Let's move the table. Friends. 50 years ago ... a small group of pioneers came to this valley for the first time. But we are not here just to celebrate our Golden Jubilee. We are also here to honor the man who led the pioneers. A man with courage and leadership, inspired them during the long dangerous journey. I don't need to tell you who he is. You all know him, as the elder and the best citizen. Major Steven Braddock. Thank you for your beautiful speech, Bill. But I would like you to stop making people think that I am older than Methuselah. Seriously, guys. I am very grateful to be standing here today. All of this makes me realize what the New Hope Valley means. We got here and found a desert. We had to dig, scrape, and sweat to build our home. And none of us cared, because we all feel the same way. Deep down we all have the feeling that we have come home. He gave us life, he gave us the harvest ... and grass for our flock. We have built a family here. We have seen them grow and become men and women. In fact, God was so good to us that we don't have much to ask of Him. And finally, let's pray. God protect us and keep us safe. And if you agree ... we would like to continue with what we have in the past. What if our children and their children's children ... have the same peace ... and the ability to know, we will be more than satisfied. I recognize that this is everything anyone could ask for. - Amen. - Amen. I'd rather be shot than have to tell them that. I know. But I think they’d prefer to hear from you. Staff... I suppose, everyone knows our parliamentarian ... our honorable William Proctor. And this is Mr. Gilbert ... construction company Metropole. I have very bad news for you. These men bring news from Congress - the New Valley is doomed. - Condemned? What you mean? It seems that Metropole City needs more water and energy. So the State decided to build a dam in the Canyon of the Cut Throat and turn the valley into a reservoir. But they already have a reservoir, Cascata. - What is her problem? - It's not big enough. But they cannot do that. - We have houses here. - What will become of us? The state will buy the land and change it. - This is very nice from the State. - Can't we contest? What if we refuse to sell? I'm afraid you have no choice, friends. The State has the right to confiscate private property, when you need it for a public project. However, you will receive the full amount for your land. Do you think that money makes up for what we put in this valley? That's right. Why can't Metropole get water elsewhere? Why should we be evicted? Guys, we all feel the same way, but there is nothing we can do. Yes there is! You may not want to fight, but I will! - That's right, Major. - Well, we're going to fight. Let them try to kick us out! Yeah, let them try to start building the damn dam here. Wait a minute. - Listen to me. - Why are you here? I am responsible for the construction. The state authorized me to build the dam. And it will be built, like it or not. Take it easy. You don't know what kind of person you're dealing with, sir. But you will find out. FARMERS CHALLENGE METROPOLE WATER DISTRICT EMPLOYEES ENTRANCE PROHIBITED City man, do not enter METROPOLE SENDS OFFICERS! FLAMES DESTROY RESEARCH DATA NEW RESEARCH ordered NEW HOPE - METROPOLE DECISIONS EXPECTED TODAY. JUDGE MORSE DECIDES THE CASE OF NEW HOPE VALLEY VS. METROPOLE CITY Before delivering the decision on this case ... The court wants the state to have full understanding of the human values ​​involved. I cannot help but sympathize with the situation of the colonists. However, Metropole City has a rapidly growing population and must have ample reserve of water or face the danger of scarcity. Unfortunately the only viable location for the new reservoir is the New Hope Valley. Facing a decision based on the theory of the greater good, for the greatest number the Court confirms the State's right to confiscate these lands. Here's your state check, Jack. So they think they can force me to sell ?! That's what I did with mine. - What will we do, grandpa? - Let's keep fighting! None of those expensive lawyers are going to remove our home. - Any more orders, boss? - No. You are in charge, Harmon. If ranchers harden, you harden too. I hope you move to camp until nightfall. Hey, look! Come on! Grandmother! - Hey, grandpa, they're coming! - What? The carts are coming into the passage now. - Bring me the rifle, boy. - Grandpa, what are you going to do? There's only one way for those carts to go to Cut Stone, is crossing my land. - But they were granted passage. - But not for me! Can I go with you, grandpa? - No, you stay here with your sister. - Ah, grandpa, please! - They're on their way. - Stevie just told me. It looks like we have backup! Okay, guys, let's get to work! I don't know why I can't go with them. I can shoot as well as they can. Steve, we don't want a shooting. No, if it's the only way to stop them. - The Musketeers are back? - I do not know. Hopefully, Grandpa will be able to listen to them. - I'll get them. - No, you stay here, I will. - Hi, Jed. - Hello guys. Already back? - Did you have fun in the city? - No. We didn't go to have fun. Well, you got there on time, you're in luck, I just got it from the post office. It seems to me that everyone is receiving one of those registered letters today. That's right, it came from the state capital. It's a check for land. - They have quick service. - Too fast, for me. $ 3,200 is not bad for a small cattle ranch. But it is also not good. Stoney, the construction company's wagons are coming. Grandpa and other ranchers came to stop them. They may well declare war on Metropole City. I know! Perhaps you can make him hear the voice of reason, I cannot. Didn't the Major get a check for his ranch? - Certainly. I delivered. - He took it and tore it. He tore, right? It seems! - Hey, see this? - Yea. - What's the idea? - You have eyes, don't you? This is my property and I intend to protect it. Listen, grandpa. I won't waste my time arguing. I have orders to go with the carts. Go ahead and try it, if you want to lose your skin. Well, I'm going to give you exactly 5 minutes to clear this road. Otherwise, we will come and release it for you. You'll have to pick us up first. The major must have gone to war. Yes, and it will end up in a penitentiary too. What's with the ranchers trying to stop my carts, sheriff? We'll know more when we get there. Yes, but they were all communicated. I know, but people tend to lose their reason when they want to take their property away from them. The time is over! - Are you going to clear the road !? - No! Very well, Jim. Move the carts. Next time will be to get it right. Okay, Jim, it's your fault. You started this. Yeah, and we'll be done. Come on, Jackson, let's show these fools. It will burn everything. As soon as we burn everything, we will pass. Wait here, Celia. - They will burn everything! - An old Indian trick. - Exactly what I thought. - Let's go guys. We better get out of here. - Grandpa, are you hurt? - No, just furious. It looks like a 1st class fight. What you are? A judge or peace officer? I'm sorry guys, but I have to arrest you. The law provides for punishment for material damage to the state ... and I’ll make sure you get it. Here we have a piece of state property that is certainly damaged. Let's go guys. - You have no right to sue. - No! They attacked my carts and my group. Your group retaliated by burning oil, this is a very unpleasant image. An investigation can hurt you a lot. And cause delays. You want to finish this job on schedule, don't you? Of course, but how about that bunch of quarrelsome fools on my feet? I think I have a solution for that. Let's consider it from the ranchers' perspective. They must give up their homes, move away, possibly get away from family and friends. Yes I know. If they behave, they can stay until the dam is completed. This will give you plenty of time to move. You are forgetting that many of them never left this valley. They don't know where to go, where to look for a new home. We must help them. It is suddenly becoming benevolent. Don't worry, I'm looking our way. I came across a very promising real estate contract , with your cooperation ... I think I can persuade ranchers to invest. They won't even hear you. They can hear the Musketeers. Don't worry, boy. Judge Ross is going to release us soon. And then we're going to show them that the fight has just begun. The fight has just begun, and see where we are. We have the right on our side, we are inclined to win. Oh, that is not in the cards, Major. It's a handful of men against a big city. And even? Greece did that. They took the city of Troy with fewer people than us. - Do not say. How is it done? - With a wooden horse. With wooden horse? Yes, a big, huge wooden horse! Yes, that is too big a lie to believe, Major. If I had said it was a live horse , we could have believed it. Wait a minute, guys. Only the Musketeers. The others remain here. Why are we just leaving? I do not know. All I know is that Gilbert wants to speak to you at his office. You must have realized that you cannot stop progress. Burning a fuel tank is your idea of ​​progress, I suppose. No, it's not. In fact, as soon as I heard, I fired Harmon. However, this dam has to be built ... and we will have to call the National Guard. So let's be sensible and start planning for the future. It's fine by me. - Sure, is there a catch to that? - No, it doesn't. The greatest public-minded man in the state developed a plan and I think you must agree. If you endorse ... I will be confident that the other ranchers will follow. Well, there he is now. - Hello guys. - Hello. I want you to meet Mr. Dodge. Mr. Dodge, they are the Musketeers. - Nice to meet you. - How is it going. Mr. Dodge represents real estate development. Like the problem of new homes for your ranchers ... If the majority is willing to invest, they will be able to receive good land at low cost. But I will let Mr. Dodge tell you. I really want to show you. - What is it? Your samples? - You can call it that. This is just a desert land. Is this your idea of a good investment? One of the best, Mr. Jackson. You are looking at pictures of the Empire Valley before they are irrigated. This is the same territory these days. Agricultural farms and orchards. And a lot of grazing land for livestock. You saw what the water did for Empire Valley. You can do the same with this land they are offering us. And with the money we will receive from the state ... we can buy 2 acres for every acre we deliver. And we still have a lot of money left for our first year of spending. So, what do you say, guys? It seems like a fair proposal. I don't think we can get any better. What do you think, Major? Well ... I still don't understand how to get water there. This is very easy. Our company intends to build a pipe from here to there. But how will it pass over the mountains? By tunnel. The work will be completed when you are ready to move. In two years, gentlemen, the land will be worth three times more than it is paying. Maybe. If this agreement is true. We checked the Atlas. And it's cute there. We are not asking you to put money until the tubes are installed. DAM CONSTRUCTION BEGINS STARTS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE DUCTS FOR DEVIL'S ACRES Hey, guys! - Hi guys. - Did you gather the entire herd? - We're doing it now. - Do you need help? Little boy, you will not lead any flock. Ah, grandpa. The Major will need you here, Stevie. It is an important job to drive the caravan of wagons. - I think it is. - When do you think you're leaving? We will have conditions at the end of the week. Very well, Major. See you at Devil's Acres. Good luck. The cattle will need water soon. Devil's Acres is right up there, we'll have water there. There is a pipe ahead. Hey, look at this. It looks like ranchers wo n't have water when they get here. Nor did they begin to drill the tunnel. I believe that they never intended to do that. So what are all these tubes for? To deceive ourselves and buy useless land. They sure did. And we help them sell the ranches and goods. I recognize that we must be busy and see what we can do about it. Take the cattle back to the valley. We're going to the county. The Musketeers are going to see you. IT IS! Maybe I better not be here when they arrive. If I were you, I would take a long trip. You certainly put me in a difficult situation with that deal with those bad lands of yours. I do not understand. I had to promise to let them stay at the ranch. - But you won't do that, right? - Who do you think I am? I'll get a fat bonus if I finish the job on time ... and nothing will stop me! It seems that we were already being expected. Come on, go over there. Come on! Well! Here we are. Your grandmother and I came here together, Celia. We helped create this place. Now... Now I have to leave and leave it behind. This is unfair. She wants you to leave, grandpa. People will need a leader now more than ever. That's true. Come on, Alan. Guys, how smart we are! Tell Gilbert where we were going. At least we found one thing ... he and Proctor work together. This will do damned good to ranchers. They 're probably on their way to Devil's Acres at this hour and ... Gilbert prepared to flood the valley. Go get the horses. If the tubes don't go through the mountains, there will be no chance of having water at Devil's Acres. We will have nowhere to live if our homes are washed away. I told you that everything was a fraud. You're right, Major, but now we have to stop them from flooding the valley. - I'll go with you. - Me too. It looks like we're going to finish on schedule. I never failed in my job. Hey, look! Better get the boys together, we might be in trouble. They opened the floodgates. DAMNED GROUND SCAMERS PROCTOR AND DODGE CONDEMNED TO 10 YEARS OF PRISON. DEVIL'S ACRES CLAIMED Now it looks more like those photos that those rascals showed us. What is the name we should give? Oh, so beautiful and welcoming. - Let's call him New New Hope. - It looks like you're stuttering. It has a city by the name of Walla Walla. Yeah, and another Sing Sing.
