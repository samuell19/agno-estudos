Que pasa? - No pasa nada. I'm coming ! It's okay, we heard you. Mr. Montesiho. Master Lamsky? Don't you usually send me a registered letter? I sent you ten. You don't come looking for them. You have a point there. It's my desire to see you again. Come in. Sorry miss. Hello. Excuse me... You don't have a turn signal? - What? It's not "what", it's "pardon". What? - No I... Forget that. It looks like Brancusi, but it's rubbish. But the armchair, it's worth an arm, that. Don't you want a coffee, a tea, a soda? I am following you from the Porte Dauphine. You never use your turn signal, it's dangerous. Where are you following me from? Well, I was behind you. - Watch out for your ash. - What's your problem ? Dad, stop it. It's inconvenient. - In English, please. - Fuck off, Dad. Good! Stop ! Stop ! Stop that tow truck. We should have used the zebra. Go ahead, darling. Julie ! Have a good week, darling. Are you okay, sweetie? Did it go well ? - Awesome Be reasonable. I promise you we'll take care of it. Take your phone and call! Hello, it's me. - I hate it when you say that. - When I say what? - "It's me." It is me, I'm not going to say it's not me. What do you want? Why will Julie have a party? Because she has a birthday. Will you be there ? - Yes - I don't want my daughter to have a lousy sexual experience with a kid who doesn't even have a high school diploma. I swear that I jump, on the lives of my children! You do not have any. - One more reason! My mother has only me. - She died. - I know. - You are scaring me. - This car is my only memory of her. Jean-Christophe, I beg you. Oh fuck ! No ! Mr. Montesiho! Oh fuck... Oh fuck... Oh fuck ! Sainte-Croix School Come on, Saint-Etienne! THE BEST IS YET TO COME We are the best ! Our Father who art in heaven - Stay there. No no no ! - Come over here, you! Hey! - Good evening, Mrs. Hernandez. - Good evening. They still haven't repaired the code. - Yes, I called the trustee. Thank you. Pardon. - Boo! - What is with you!? - Wait, wait! - What happened ? - Moving. - Are you moving? I needed space. It was loaded. Show me. Whoa! Wait... It's not pretty. I'll take you to the hospital. Come. - No! I'm not going to the hospital. - You have to get sewn up and have an X-ray taken. - Do it yourself. I haven't done that since boarding school. And I don't have the material. It makes you impotent. What does make you impotent? - X-rays make you impotent. Of course not... 1000 testicular x-rays, that eventually makes you impotent, not a shoulder blade x-ray. Come. Come. I bet you know the manager. If everyone starts cheating... - You're not everyone. - Exactly. - Exactly, what? - We must set an example. - For whom? - It's a matter of principle! - A what ? - Come on! Good evening madam. - Carte Vitale, please. - My Vital Card ... I have a Gold, an Amex, a Black, a card for the pool... I'm joking. Give her my vital card. He's the one who has it. Can you give it? Madame has other things to do. - Sorry, I... Excuse me. - It's this one. Thank you. - Thank you. M. Dreyfus. - Yes. - Do you have a mutual? - But of course ! A mutual The Bretagne Atlantique mutual fund. Doesn't that make you want to see the sea? - So ? - Not even a cracked rib. 3 hours for nothing. - I'm going to bed. - It's not even 10am! You're right. Let's take one last mojito. Wait, you can't do this to me. What's the matter ? - A good joke like that, after 20 years, I was not ready. - Good night, big boy. - You're not gonna see me home? - Oh no ! - I still have a lot of pain. - Good night ! Like I said, there is a prevalence of Friedlander's bacillus during the dry season. And the reverse is true for Staphylococcus aureus. - Excuse me. - Yes ? - So there are more staphylococci during the rainy season? - I said it, didn't I? - Yes. - What ? - Yes. - So why this question? - It's nothing. Sorry. - Sorry ? - It's nothing. Sorry. - Miss, do I have the reputation of being a cool teacher? - Not too much. - Not too much, no. So I ask you again... Why this question ? Because during our presentation of epidemiology, - Professor Codaven told us that... - I don't have the same discourse as the reputable head of the service? I'll tell you something. If one day you have the chance to work with Professor Codaven, watch him well. Write down everything he says, whatever he does. So when the time comes, when you have a problem, you may wonder what he would have done and do the exact opposite. That's my advice. Received today at 13:34. -Hello, Doctor Dreyfus. It's Doctor Cerceau. You did an x-ray in the emergency room. I would like to talk to you about it. If you could come see me. Thank you. Hello doctor. - Arthur Dreyfus. - Thierry Cerceau. Sorry for the wait. You're welcome. Was there a problem with my vital card? - The vital card? - Yes. - No, no problem with the vital card. - Ah, fine ! - You... - Come on, I'll explain. I did my last year internship with your wife, in the Tubiana service at La Salpe. - Very good... - I asked you to come because I looked at the x-ray last night. Have you seen it? - No no. - We can ask Virginie to be present. - Virginie ? - Since she's not far away, she could... - No no ... - We're divorced with Virginie. - Ah? As you wear the wedding ring, I thought... Oh no, I can't... remove it. So can we get to the point? Yes of course. Uh... So, there you go. The radiology intern focused on your chest pain, hematoma, cracked ribs But he didn't pay attention to the rest. Well. It happens. - The rest ? - I'm not going to lie to you... It's not good. The X-ray is not good at all. Not good... Not good ? - Not good, no... not good. Ah, not good, not good... As you see it, we have ganglia, lung nodules there, there and there. - Hold on. But there are some ... There is some on the pleura. But they are everywhere! - There's also a pleural effusion there. Do you cough ? - No. - Do you have headaches? - No... no Vomiting? - Apparently not. Do you smoke ? - What ? - I'm asking if you smoke. Quit for 20 years ago, I think. In top form. - Okay. But are you sure you understood correctly? - Be gentle. - Yes. - How long ? - Given the dissemination, I'm afraid that chemotherapy and surgery are useless. But we will do everything to prevent the pain from setting in. - How much time is there left? We're doctors, not fortune tellers. If you are not in pain, we can hope for six months. I am sorry. -Hello. Cesar here. Leave a message after the beep. Beep! No, not that one. That one. Beep - It's Arthur. Can you call me back, please? Cesar, I need to talk to you about something. Cesar, I need to talk to you about something. You will be surprised. The tests are very bad. They are not good at all. I'm warning you, it's not very good news. It is even very bad news. The tests are very, very bad. I tell you they are very bad. The tests are very bad. Yes, Cesar, it is serious. Cancer is serious. Shit - Sorry, sorry, sorry! I ran into your concierge. She didn't want to let go of me anymore. She's right. Your front door, it makes no sense. What is the intercom good for, if it's open? - Yes I know. I spoke to the trustee about it. - If I were rich, I would piss all the time. - I need to talk to you. - Me too. A champagne or a white wine? Me, it's more champagne. - Me, it's more white wine. - Shit... bad news? - Yes. - Okay, we'll do mine first. It will soften yours. You won't believe me. You are not ready. I will become a dad. - Eh? - Yeah, for one! For the second, we'll see later. It's crazy, isn't it? Come on, come on! It hurts you. I knew it would cut you in half. You have to meet Lucia. Drink! What is this funeral face? And yours ? - Mine ? - Your news. What is it? - It's nothing at all. - What is it ? - Never mind. Not today, I don't want to. - Tell me. - No wait ! - Tell me. - I explain to you. Uh... Oh, how about we talk about it tomorrow? What... are you okay? - Good listen. Uh... You, you... Your... Your... Your... - Me me... what the fuck? - I can talk, can I? It's not easy either, you understand? It is even difficult. - I'm listening to you. - Yes, good ! Where was I? "Your... Your... Your... Your." - Before, I said something else. - "You." No, you said, "It's not easy." - Ah, there you go. It is not easy. Yes that's it. Voila. It's... I mean... You... You have always been the first amongst us. You've always done everything before me. Except the kids. It is true. And the exams and tests. Tests ? I have always failed them, so frankly... That's it. The tests were not good. - What are you talking about ? - Lung carcinomas. - What? - Lung carcinomas. - Isn't that cancer? - Yes. - No? - Yes. - But you're not going to die? - Eh ? - Cesar ? Cesar... I must talk to you. I do not believe it. You are so strong, look at you. Listen to me. I told you to quit smoking, damn it. That's not the problem, you know. It's not fair. - Cesar. - It should have been me. No one should be sick. It's bullshit. Well, damn! Of course not. Me, I took advantage, I screwed up. And you, you've never done anything. You don't drink, you don't take drugs, you don't fuck. You don't even take the plane. - I fuck a little... - You know what I mean. You go to bed early, you vote centrist, you've never cheated on the metro. Have you ever cheated? - No. - You see ? It's disgusting. And now I'm having a kid. Cesar, listen to me. You have to... Do Virginie and Julie know? - Uh... no. Only me? - Um... yes. I'm touched. It's nothing. No, it touches me. It can't be easy to say it loud. - Well no. But we're strong. And we're together. OK ? It will be fine. Madame Renou. Excuse me, Mr. Dreyfus first. It won't take long. Excuse me. I'm coming. What did I tell you last time? I need to talk to you. - Does this concern Julie? - Uh... no. So we call each other. I have work to do. - This is something very serious. - Ah yes ? What? Did Julie abuse Nutella? Do you have to take the plane? No!! Listen to me for two seconds, Virginie. There's no more Virginie! Go weep on Cesar's shoulder. - There's no way to... - Stop! And stop with the English, you're going to make Julie crazy. - I can't. - You can. Good-bye, Mr. Dreyfus. - It's not possible. - Yes it is. Madame Renou, over to you. Well, I have a question, but it's a bit complicated. I will do my best, my son. Could you please not call me "my son"? I get along very badly with my father, and that's... How do you want that I call you? By my first name, that will be good. Which is...? - Sorry... Cesar. Very well, Cesar. So rather than "my father", call me "Bernard". Ah, that won't be possible. That's my father's first name, exactly. Don't call me, then. It's no big deal. What is your question ? Well... I have a friend who is very ill. And I would like to pray for him. But he is a Catholic Jew. And I am a Jewish Jew. So I don't know which God to pray to. Mine or his? I wouldn't want to make a mistake. There is only one God, Cesar. If you pray to God with your heart, God will hear you. There's only one God, but we can't all agree which one. Is your friend a practitioner? Not really. I've never seen him in a church and he doesn't wear the kippah, even on Yom Kippur. Well, he's Ashkenazi Communist on the father's side, Southwestern Catholic on the mother's side. So not really Jewish, but Jewish nonetheless. Not really circumcised. - What about you? - Me ? Yes ! Me, all gone. - No. Are you a practitioner? - Me ? Right-wing Sephardic. Very easy. A Shabbat every now and then and everyone is happy. You just have to pray in a church and in a synagogue. God won't blame you. I don't want him to think I'm cheating. Like the guy who bets on reds and blacks in the casino. God won't blame you. He will see that you are doing the best for your friend. - Are you sure ? - Sure. Really ? Yes. OK. Cool. You're cool. - Yes... - It's true, honestly. It's cool. - It's cool, yes It's cool Yes, totally. - Okay. So... Good bye, sir. Ah ! Going to Lourdes - is it worth it, or is it too much? - Uh... It's too much. That's what I thought. Thank you. Hola. Que tal? - Oh ! "Cesare"! - What are you doing here ? It's "Cesare"! Mi amigo. Why did you let him drink like that? Sorry to have disturbed Lucia, I wanted to talk to you, you understand? - It's ok. - I can't take it anymore. - What's wrong? Cesar, you really have to listen to me. I'm listening to you. Really. I am sorry. I am really sorry. I don't know what got into me. It will be fine. No, it's not going to be fine at all. It's not going to be fine at all. Because... I'm alright. I'm alright. I'm fine. I have nothing, me. I'm fine. You're the one who's not fine at all. I am very fine. No, you're not! Yes, I'm fine. - You're going to die, Cesar. It is you who will die. - You will die. - It's not serious. But it is serious. You will die anyway. Okay. This is appalling. Cry some, it's going to be fine. Go on! Got a nice one, eh? You're not crying? Yes, I'm crying. Inside, but I'm crying. Come on. For me, now everything is fine. I was able to resume dancing regularly. I am in remission. - It's awesome. - Very well. Thanks, Odile. Okay, well... see you next week. See you on Friday ? - Yes goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hello. - Hello. The next group is at 4 p.m. It's not for me, it's for a friend. Tell him to come. It's a little complicated. Since yesterday he says he's sicker. - Ah ? - So, what do I do? - Arthur ? Arthur ? Codaven has arrived. The meeting will begin. I'm coming. So, where are we on this case? I took charge of the comparative study. For the synthesis, we must see with Professor Chabert. - Very well. - Unfortunately, this is very disappointing. You know what they say: "Researchers who seek, they find, "but researchers who find, "are looking for something else." Cesar ? You come home late. - What are you doing here? - My friend the concierge opened the door for me. I settle here. I don't leave you anymore. - Wait... - I want to come with you. To be present. Come on, I made you cannelloni. Gratines. Delicioso ! Wait a second. Lucia? She and the baby ? You can't leave them. She kicked me out me. How, from your place? I couldn't put her out on the street. But what are you going to do with the baby? She doesn't want to adopt Pablo anymore. I do not understand. Wasn't she pregnant? No why ? Do you think she was a bit fat? No, but since you told me that... You told me you were gonna be a dad. Yes, I thought so, too. But Madame has changed her mind. But why ? She finds me too childish. Not reliable, if you prefer. But who cares. The important thing is that I take care of you. - Cesar... Someone's in the living room. - What? There is a veiled woman on the sofa. Yes, it's Randa. - Who ? - Randa Ameziane. She had cancer. She's a Muslim, but the veil is actually because of cancer. She is healed. - She helps others talk about it. - About the veil? - No. Cancer. - But why ? - Why what ? Why is she sitting in the living room? It'll do you good to talk to her. - I do not want to. - I have prepared for you cannelloni and salad. Good night. - Hold on. Wait a second. Hold on ! What are you doing ? - I leave you now. - Huh? - She is great. Wait, wait. You're not gonna leave me with her. I do not know her. Arthur, you know what will happen if I stay. I'll make her laugh, fuck her and you'll be like a jerk. I don't want to fuck her. Why ? You do not know her. That's precisely why! You say that because she's sick. But you are too. Besides, she is healed. Text me if this takes longer. - Oh fuck... Good evening madam. - Good evening. Randa. - Arthur, nice to see you. You want to drink something? No thanks. - Take a seat. - Thank you. - It's nice of you to have come. - Oh it's... I tried to refuse, but your friend is very stubborn. Yes I know. Uh, that's ... In fact, it's ... It's a little complicated. It's even very complicated to explain. Uh ... It might sound crazy to you, but I'm not sick. - You're not sick? - No. Cesar thinks I am sick, but I am not. He's the one. - Ah? Is it Cesar who has cancer? Yes. I tried to tell him, but he didn't believe me. Why does Cesar think you're sick? Because I told him so. Why did you tell him you had cancer if you didn't? I told you it was complicated. Just when I was about to tell him, he told me he was going to have a child. So that took me completely by surprise. I have... I have... I... I... I... It took me too long, I got it a little tangled, I sought... the right words and I think I got it tangled. Then he collapsed. - He started to cry ? - No, he really collapsed. He fell to the ground. He felt unwell. There. Exactly there. Because of his cancer. No, because of mine. Wait... Are you sick too? No, but he believed that I am. It's simple ! I was devastated because of his son, not about my cancer, since it was his. And he, he collapsed because of my cancer because he thought that it was mine. - So... Cesar has cancer and is going to have a son. - That's it. Actually no. In reality, no! He's not going to have a son any more. Ultimately, it doesn't happen. - But cancer? - Yes, completely. - Okay. Okay. I understood, I think. - I am happy. I didn't think I was very clear. - No no. It is... It's simple. It's... It's hard to accept the disease. It's hard to realize it's real that it's happening to you and no one else. Give yourself a week. - One week ? - Yes. - For a week, I stay like... - Yes. that I have something that I don't have... So for a week I stay completely... - Yes. - And after that... - Arthur ? - I'm in Julie's room! This is where I install you. - So ? - Great, that girl! - Ah ! - It did me a lot of good to see her. I feel... How to say ? Super light. She left ? Yes. But she invited me to a group session. Great ! You'll go ? Perhaps. Perhaps. And you could come too. Yeah. If you want. I'm glad you're here. Me too. We're gonna do some great stuff. You look weird to me. Are you sure you haven't fucked her a bit? What - are you stupid! What would you want to do, like right now? Other than going to bed? - Yes. - I dunno. And you ? - Go eat a Bejing duck in Belleville. - OK, OK. - Yes ? - Let's go. - Tomorrow evening. Why tomorrow? Because I have an appointment tomorrow morning, very early. You don't have to give a fuck about your appointment. You're going to stop working. Cesar, I can't change everything overnight. I need time to organize myself. Very well. Organize yourself well. Good night. OK, let's go. Dreyfus! What is that ? Was this sent to everyone? Are you kidding me ? - I'm sorry, eh... It's... It's... I didn't write this email. Who did then? The Russians ? Well, excuse me... Have you seen me make such spelling mistakes? Never. Look here, for example. "You just suck ball." "Ball" is in the singular. Generally, you suck balls. So there should be an "s". There, "you are incompetant". "Incompetent" is not written like that sorry, there is an "e", not an "a". There, "you're face is..." OK, OK... I understand. You will now invite the team together and explain that you have been hacked and that you do not mean a word of this. Is it clear ? What's the matter ? I do not understand. Aren't you punishing me more? You can't let this just go. - But since it was not you... - It still came from my mailbox. We're not going to make a big deal out of it, Dreyfus. - Very well. - You understand. - Yes, but no. You still have it: "Codaven, you're just a ball sucker. "Pantsface. Shit raclette." Twice. - I read it. - "Motherf..." Yes, I read. Thank you. Well, I'm going to blame you then. OK. Yes, but it's not enough. Not enough? How should I punish you then? Well, at least a week's layoff. - One week ? But how am I going to do without you? - Ask my ex-wife. OK, it's a liberation. Good luck. Thank you so much. - Are you sick or what? Fuck ! - Sucker of balls, it needs an "s". OK ? - OK. Shall we do it, that Beijing duck? Asshole! It takes two "s" in the middle. - You've finished ? - Almost. Can I put what I want? - Obviously. Let's go. I will finally get to know the most shameful fantasies of Arthur Dreyfus. Are you kidding me ? - What ? "Discovery of the vaccine against bacillary dysentery." - Yes. "Winning the Nobel Prize, "walking on the moon with Julie." You, who are afraid to take the plane. You asked me to write down my dreams. But realistic ones. These are more than dreams. Arthur, we have 3 months. I'm not going to take you to the moon. What do you want to do before you die? Things that we can do together. - That's the maximum. What do I want to do? I dunno. Sleep under the stars ? Go to the grave of Albert Schweizer. Reread Proust in full, plus the other period also, "Jean Santeuil". What do I want? Buy a rope to hang me. But why ? I have simple tastes. They're not simple, they suck. Reread Proust... You'll have all the time in the hospital. You're strange. This inability to understand that reading... In your mind, it's wasting time. - But that has nothing to do with it. It's not a dream. It's not something that's amazing. - It's the biggest dream. - You do it all the time. - Go on. Make your list then. Go on. - For me, it's not the list of things you did last week. - OK. Let's see "Parachuting. Driving a Formula 1." I have never done it. "Swimming with a dolphin. "Patting a koala and an elephant. "Make love under a waterfall. "Making love with twins." - You know, sisters, not... Hm... maybe you could make love with koala twins under a waterfall. Like that, snap, you hit two birds with one stone. Come on! I'm sorry if before dying I prefer to kiss and not read Proust. This is a list of a 15-year old teenager. I may be benevolent, but these are dreams of a 15 year old. That's not very nice. Not very nice. Miss! You're right, we'll never agree. We're going to do fifty-fifty. - What? We each choose something and the other is obliged to do so. I'm not taking a plane. Here, it's not democracy. Otherwise, go to union. - I am a member of the union. - Shit ! Okay, it's up to you. Me, I chose to eat spring rolls. What do you want to do? Without thinking ! Return to Sainte-Croix. Super. Sainte-Croix, fuck! There is nothing more boring than that school. Can you stop saying "fuck"? Why do you want to go there? I'm parked on the other side. Biarritz is just 700 miles away. 780. - Give me ten bucks - What? - Give me ten bucks. - Haven't you gone bankrupt yet? - But no ! If you had gone bankrupt, would you tell me? Everyone has their own problems, I'm not going to complain. Give me ten bucks and we talk about something else. Come on. - What's this ? - Come. - Can you tell me what we're doing? - You chose where we are going, I choose how we go. What are you doing ? What does it look like ? - You're stealing a car? - But no. - But yes ! - It's mine. Why are you stealing your own car? I left it as security with my creditor. - Yes. So, it doesn't belong to you anymore. - Technically, no. But sentimentally... - For the police... - You're going to let me go, yes? This is the one I want. It's my turn. This is my wish. OK ? Fuck... - Leave it to me. I'm going to get there. You don't know how to unclog a sink. Try if you're so smart. Make me do this... Come on, there you go! - You should have become a surgeon. I am a researcher at the Institute Pasteur. What a waste ! Do you know how to pronounce "Saab" in Swedish? No. - Zob. - What? - It means you drive a Zob. Be careful, it was my mother's Zob. Oh yes, very Freudian, too. Are you nuts? It's okay. You will die. You do not care. We don't have to die tonight. Look, there's no one left. I wonder how we ever became friends. You were drawn to my extremely manly side. Frankly, this is crazy. It's crazy that we're friends. We are absolute opposites. - Yes, absolutely the other way around. You could say that. If we didn't know each other, I would see us as bad friends. If we didn't know each other, of course. Are you going to repeat everything I say? Well, it's not stupid what you say. You know what I mean. And I know what I mean. - Are you driving them crazy, your students? I'm sure you do. Having said that, I think I would have a hard time being my friend. - Why ? - I would get tired. - You tire me out enormously. You know, when Virginie left, she said a terrible thing to me. She said : "I love you so much, "but not enough to support you." The violence of that! "I love you very much, but not enough to support you." I can tell you that to receive this after 15 years of living together, it made me desperate. I was very hurt. I went to consult, see a doctor. Doctor Chayevski, a shrink, or a psychiatrist, I don't know. And he said to me: "To be loved, you must first get to know yourself." You would have been stupid not to go see him. And he took 60 euros for that? - 110. - No way ? I would say that after a month, I knew enough not to want to know more. Afterwards, I told him about my suicidal thoughts. What did he say? To pay for the sessions in advance. - No ? - I swear. - Stop it.. - I swear. - Stop it.. - But I swear, Cesar! He's a genius. Yes, he's a genius. - We arrive at Sainte-Croix. How long have I slept? All the time. Like a log. I can't believe you want to come back here. I do not believe it. And that's... The bedding shop, damn. I came just to see if the oak tree was still there. I don't know, see the dorm again. The football fields. The detention rooms. Mr. Rassamian's office. Oh yes, that one! - So what do we do ? - What do you mean? We celebrate. The party. La Fiesta. La nouba. La bamboche. The tour of the grand dukes. The fiesta! Five ! Yes! You won, you fool! - Did I? - Look. - I won ! I won ? Turtle... turtle... turtle! Not possible ! Eight, black! We lost everything. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - You're looking at me. - No I'm not! - Yes you are! - You are very handsome. - Oh good, you think? - Yeah. You look a lot older than me but with the suit, you look good. - You're too nice. You could have found us two different tuxedos. - They gave me a price, I wasn't going to negotiate. - We haven't... I don't know. Don't you think we look like idiots? - Yes. But well-dressed idiots. That makes all the difference. - I don't want... I don't want to go in there. - Come on! - No. There's no way I'm paying to fuck. They're not professionals, they're volunteers. Oh, it's free? You pay, and after, it's all-you-can-eat buffet. But it's creepy. It's very creepy. - Not at all. It's fun. Do you like tennis? In tournament, you play with people that you don't know, that you didn't choose. Singles, doubles, mixed doubles. Okay, okay, I get it. It's the same, but without a racket. Without a racket? I quit. - Oh ! Arthur, wait! They might have rackets. I wanted to save you time. You don't want to pay, you don't want a free buffet... I respect. But here, we will have to hunt. Do you still know how? Do not worry about me. Have you had a lot of girls since Virginie? Do you think I'm going to talk to you about this? The greatest pleasure of sex, is talking about it. We don't have the same taste and we don't have the same relationship with women. At least I have sex. I have the impression that you don't shoot many arrows anymore. Do not worry about me. I'm doing better than you think. - Ah yes? Lots of arrows? Quite a few arrows. Aren't you a bit rusty? Not at all. OK show me. What? Show me. Flirt with me. Are you serious ? - There is no joker, chicken. - Very well. After you, miss. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Alexandra, 24 years old. - Sorry. You are lovely, but you are a little young. - Myriam, 57 years old. - Straight to 57? Isn't there anything... - Well... M√©lanie, 37, divorced. I work in human resources. Because I have resources and I love people. - Arthur, 56 years old. I am a researcher. Because I like to seek, and I like to find. Do you have a big microscope? Some say the biggest in Europe. - Don't you say ! - You want to drink something ? - Are you hitting on me, Arthur? - No no... - Why are you saying no? Why are you apologizing? You were fine. I was starting to get excited. My little nipples became pointy. It was biting already. Bring up the fish. Let me fish my way, M√©lanie. Are you hitting on me? No I think not. - I think so. - Is it showing that much ? Let's play doctor. Okay. So let me whisper the prescription to you. Oh yes ! Are you stupid? - What ? - It's not okay ? But you said your nipples are sticking out. I'm going... Looks like it took a bite out of the hook, big bitch. Could you please be more discreet? Pardon ? Could you be more discreet? Do you have a problem with gay men? Not at all. But it is a family restaurant. So, uh... - And the couple behind, did you asked them to behave? - No, but that has nothing to do with it. - And why not? - That is to say... - That is to say what? Go ahead, quickly! - They are less... - What is less? - It's just more... - Speak louder, I can't hear. What is there? I can not hear. - It's okay, Cesar. - No, it's not okay. It's not okay at all. It's scandalous. It's disgusting. Come on, honey. Since we are not wanted here, we get out. Don't you dare to pay, or leave a tip. The master takes care of that. Bye, idiots! One two three. "In Between Days" (The Cure) - Tag ! - Tag ! It's okay ? It's okay ? I pulled too much on the peg tonight. Here is one who understood everything. - It's over there. - Yes, over there. Uh Listen to this. They say there is a guy in India, Dipankar Aman Kapoor, that works miracles with cancer. He saved Armstrong. - Armstrong, the astronaut? - No, the trumpeter. - The trumpeter? - Come on... The cyclist! He later won 5 Tours de France, maybe he will save you years. But he's great, this guy! Where are you taking me? On Pasteur's grave? At the microbe museum? Be patient. Arthur. - Hm? You have a good shit face there. Don't you want me to drive a little? - No, because it keeps me awake. Very reassuring. Where are we going? What... Stop. Listen, it's my turn, Cesar. Stop that car! Listen to me. I'm not going back there. I'm not going back! - You're crazy ? But anyway, Cesar! You are completely nuts! I'm not going back there. - It's been 20 years. 20 years, can you hear me? - 20, 30, 40... I don't give a fuck. Do you think he's changed? That he has become caring? That he's going to give me a hug? What do you think ? I don't know, but nobody knows. No one ! Not you, not me! He's your only family. There's no family! There's nobody, there's nothing left. He's still your father! You can not... - I can't what? - You can't stay in this situation. - Can't I stay in this situation? What the hell am I doing? Shall I start lecturing you? I'm talking about your wife who left 5 years ago and that you wait like a mutt? How long are you going to drag it along? - You want to play this? Is it the big moment of truth? Do you want to empty your bag? - Maybe. - Go ahead, old man. - You're pissing me off. - Already? Ah yes, is that all? You get out. As usual. - Pardon ? - I'm waiting like a dog, you run like a rabbit. - Ah? - Yes, you run from everything, when faced with responsibilities, your father, love, women! - You tell me that? - Yes. But what are we talking about? You're right, I should talk about girls. They're young, they don't know much. So, they admire you. OK. - You want me to tell you your problem? You're jealous. You are frustrated. Do you think you make me envious? You're pitiful. Look at you. You're all alone. And only me will be at your funeral. Yes, just me. And the failure of C√©sar Montesiho. Talk about a success. You don't want talk about the Nobel Prize? - You really are an asshole, Cesar. Dirty asshole who sends you shit. Do you want to die alone? Well, die alone. - Yes ? -It's the dirty asshole on the line. You sleep ? Not anymore. I am sorry. I didn't mean all the bullshit I said. You know that ? I know. I know. How am I going to do it without you? I'm not going to do it on my own. Me neither, Cesar. Me neither, you know. Have you spoken to Virginie? You told her ? - Not yet. You have to talk to her. Yes, Cesar. I need to talk to her. But we both have to talk. You hear me ? We both have to talk. Where are you ? You can come ? No, I'm fine. Don't worry. I just wanted to kiss you goodnight, but it's okay. You're sure ? - No, that's cool. Come on, good night, mate! Good night. But what is it ? Happy birthday. Hein ? Happy Birthday. I read on the internet that dogs help to heal. It brings peace and happiness. Look at this doggie! Admit he's cute Yes indeed. It is very kind of you. It's adorable, even. But how to tell you? I am not much of a dog person. His name is Napoleon. Look at his eyes. His eyes say it all. What are they telling you? They wonder why you don't open your packages. I bought you lots of gifts. With your credit card. - Yes ! I don't know how to serve anymore. I'm not sure I like it. - Relax. Bouh ! - Breathe. - Shit ! - It's okay ? Ah, my dear, how are you? Am I bothering you ? Not at all. It's your weekend. I know. I was talking about it with Cesar, precisely. What is that ? It's a dog. Have you been drinking or what? I've gone crazy with my cardiac arrhythmias. I'm happy to see you. It's okay ? Did you get all, is it OK? - Bye! Watch out. Have a good week, darling! - Shit... - It's okay ? Cool, you thought of the bread! - I'm coming. - Okay. Hi my dear. It smells like a goat here. Hi Mom. Was it ok with your father? Yes.. Yes. And what did you do? The usual. Does he have a new car? No, it's Cesar's. What happened to the Volvo? They took it to Biarritz. What was he doing in Biarritz? If you have any questions, ask him. The goat is going to take a shower. I stroked it! Arthur, I stroked it! Run ! Quick ! - He did it! - Oh fuck ! Dr Lazar here. I'd like to speak to Doctor Dreyfus. Yes, it is urgent. Yes ? Hello, Sylvie? Yes, I am fine ? Tell me, where is he, Arthur? I can't reach him. Hein ? What? Sucking balls and shit raclette? No? Hel... Hello. - Arthur? Arthur ! Arthur ! I call him, but he doesn't answer. Hello. Where is he ? He's towing his... - His car, yes. What is going on ? - Nothing's going on. - Nothing ? He was fired, you live with him, you hunt an elephant... - A baby elephant. - Don't mess with me! What is this? It's nothing, relax. Do you want a coffee, something? There isn't anything serious, I hope? It's not possible... But how is he? Does he suffer ? I dunno. He is admirable. He doesn't complain, he never says anything. Is that so ? He takes it with dignity. He is heroic. Really. No one can realize anything. He smiles all the time, he's ... He is incredible. He came to talk to me. He wanted to see me and I... I kicked him out. What a bitch! I'm sure he doesn't blame you. - You think so? - Of course ! You married an amazing guy. - He's no longer my husband, Cesar. - Yes... But you still love him. - He's my daughter's father. - He still loves you. As a mater of fact... I wanted to introduce him to girls Women. To... you know... - Yes, I get it. Because -you're good. You're beautiful, and everything... But these were... Top level. No, not top level. High level. Highest Crazy ! Do you know what he told me? I dunno. What? The only person I want to make love with is you. You? No, you. Not me. - Ah ! You, Virginia. The only one he wants to fuck is you. Crazy, right? Yes, it's crazy! You're the least tactful guy I know. I wish someone said that about me. Yes, but it's you. He's going to need you. You are the woman of his life. Yes, but it's over. I am with Bertrand now. Yeah, well... If you loved him that much, we wouldn't... No, stop. I don't know what I'm gonna do. You don't tell him I told you, eh? Because I promised. I don't understand, Virginie. You have to accept that I am surprised. Hello. Ah, hello. You're okay ? - Yes. And you ? I'll call you back. Say hello to the lady. We went to Biarritz. Not always easy, but... It did him good to see you. So much the better. - Hello. - Hello. - It is a pleasure. You are fine ? - Me too. Very well. I got to know your dog. - Adorable. - He is very cute. He looks a lot like you. - Okay, I'll leave you. - Anyway, I'm glad they managed to talk. I still have a thing or two to say, anyway. Well, three or four. I have to go. See you soon. See you soon. Have a good day. Who was it ? - It was Randa. - No, on the phone. Who was it ? It was Virginie. She wants to see me. Did she tell you why? Talking about Julie, I guess. You promise me you'll tell him the truth? If you promise me to go see your father. Oh, you're not going to do it again! Please be nice. I don't want us to argue, but it is important for me. You understand ? - I will think about it. There was something there, right? There was mojo in the air with her. - Are you changing the subject? - No it's you. I felt like I was too much. - No. - Yes, Napoleon and I, we felt too much. - Sorry. - Oh ! - Sorry, I am late. - No, I'm early. - I beg your pardon. It's okay ? - Yes. Yes... Yes... - Are you sure? Because... - Yes, everything is fine. I'm just tired, but it's okay. All the better. Did you want to talk to me about something? - Oh no, not at all ! And you ? - Me, no. Actually no. Actually... as you called me, I thought that... maybe you had something to tell me. - Ah yes ! Yes, excuse me... Yes... Yes. I actually wanted to talk to you. - Um - Um yes. I wanted... I wanted to apologize for the other day. - The other day ? - When I kicked you out of the cabinet. - Oh no ! I was the one who was rude. I arrived unexpectedly. You got work. - No ! I thought, maybe you were coming ... to talk to me about something important, and I did... well And I hope if it was important you could... I want you to know that I am always here. And... that you can count on me. - That's very sweet. You can tell me. I'm here, Arthur. I can tell something is wrong. I feel it. Talk to me. Arthur. Talk to me, I'm here. Arthur. I'm warning you, it's not very good news. Okay. This is even very bad news. Okay. You'll have to be strong. I'll be strong. You'll have to be very strong. I'll be very strong. Cesar is ill. Hein ? He's dying. C√©sar ? Yes. And not you ? Well no. You're not going to die? Well, no! You're sure ? Yes. Why did he tell me that? What, did you see him? He told me you were going to die. Why? Why did he tell me that? - It is complicated. - Stop saying that ! - Hold on. Virginia! Stop it.. - If you don't tell him, I will. - Ah yes ? What good will it bring him? Me, I will have a clear conscience. But him ? He's going to know it's over, that I lied to him. And it will kill him. He is dying ! He's never been so good. He is happy, he is in harmony. He feels useful. - He has the right to know. - But of what use will it be? What is is good for? We can't cure him. What awaits him? I don't know... Palliative care, a hospital room with no one visiting. I'm just trying to help. Stop wanting to decide everything for everyone! Don't you realize ? He's got you, and you're lying to him. Have you ever lied in your life? Hein ? It's not your life, Arthur. This is his life. *"Time" (Pink Floyd) - C√©sar ? C√©sar ? C√©sar ? I'm here, because I promised Arthur. I promised to come and tell you everything. - Cesar. - Listen to me. Then I get back in my car Well, it's not even my car anymore. Because I have nothing left. I am nothing. I have missed absolutely everything in my life. You were right, I'm a good-for-nothing. But you see, it's okay. Things are going well. Because I'm not like you. And that, you see, it is very important for me. You taught me that you can have everything and be worth nothing. That, basically, I owe you. You taught me that. How you taught me to lose. Cause when I lost the one person who loved me, the only one the one that was supposed to protect me, because I was what, shit, 10 years old. The one who was supposed to protect me, he did me... he me what? He forgot about me, actually. Arthur is ill. He will die. But her daughter, thinking of her father, she can be proud. She will be able to remember something. Arthur is annoying to her. He's on her neck all the time. He's driving her crazy. But he's a good father, because he's afraid for his daughter. He is afraid for her. You never gave a fuck. You always let me do everything because you didn't give a fuck. For a long time, I wished you evil. But it has passed me. You are more than a distant and bad memory. I too have learned to live without you. Here. I think I told you everything. I have some bad coffee. I'm going home, I'm cold. You have a new message. ... Good, it's me. I did it. I talked to him. You were right, as usual. Damn, what a relief. Thanks, buddy. I hope you did too. We'll talk. Did you talk to him? - I left him a message. - Okay. And Nicole? Nicole? She lives in the South. Towards Arles, I think. Ah, that's stupid! She was so nice. Stop it. ! Do you have anybody? No, but I'm fine. Leo is watching over me. I can't stay. I have to take care of Arthur. Do what you have to do. But I'll be back. Don't worry about me. I'm glad you came. I have to take him on a trip. Afterwards, I will come back. If I can help you For once. Well if you could give me some money - A little, how much? - A bit much. You haven't changed. But where are we going? Surprise. But... We're not gonna take a plane, are we? Well no. I'm warning you, I'm not taking a plane. Stop it. Trust me. Let's go! Sorry. Excuse me. - Excuse us. - Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me... Can we pass? My friend has cancer. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - Stop doing that ! - Doing what ? - That! Saying I have cancer. It's very disturbing. But you have cancer. That's not a reason, after all. It bothers me. Excuse me ma'am. Good evening, welcome. Could you upgrade us? Because my friend has an incurable disease. I'll see what I can do. I didn't say cancer. Are you kidding me ? Stop ! - OK. - I won't get on a plane. - Who told you about a plane? - Are you kidding me ? We just went through customs. Business class isn't really a plane. I'm going home. Arthur. Arthur ! Oh fuck... Do this for me. Where are we going ? Not very far. - Meaning? I have an appointment with the Indian who saved Armstrong. The Indian? - Yes. But there's a 12-hour flight. No...! 11 hours max Come on, come on. This is my last wish. I beg you. Then we do what you want. We will go to see monasteries, mosques. We will go to baroque concerts, we will reread Proust in Latin. I beg you. Let me give you one last chance. Let me give you one last chance. I beg you. The guide picks us up tomorrow morning at 8 am. Don't be late. People come from afar to see it. I really need to talk to you. Now. - Don't say you don't want to go. It's not that. I have to tell you something. But you must promise me that you will forgive me. OK. You swear to me? I swear, but ... if you swear to me that you too will forgive me for something else. - Is that so ? So OK. - No, not OK. Swear it. It's a big thing. Mine too. Mine is a very, very big thing. I swear to you that mine is bigger. - Listen. Mine is so big that I'm afraid you will get angry. Okay, okay. I will forgive you. - Swear? - I swear. - Say: "I swear to you." - I swear to you. Good... It is not easy. Uh... I had a thing with Virginie. What? When you were separated. But you told me so much about her that I ended up missing her too. We met in a bar. We drank a lot. She was sad, I was not very strong. We consoled each other. So. You slept together? Not really... Actually Well, a little. A little ? A little. But it only happened once. And you were separated. And we drank a lot. She was sad and I wasn't very strong. But it only happened once. Yes, you had been drinking a lot. Yes a lot. It was... Yes I understand. Okay well, I forgive you. - You forgive me ? - Yes, I forgive you! - Just like that? So easily ? No, it's not easy. But I put myself in your shoes. I can understand. Wait, wait... I tell you I jumped your wife. And you, you don't care? That's not the word. What did you want to tell me? Is it serious ? Yes. Someone is sick, is someone going to die? Yes. Anyone other than you? Yes. You're gonna have to be strong. I don't want to know! - Be nice. - I don't want to know. I've been carrying this secret for two years, hating myself. So, I beg you, let me enjoy it. - Cesar. - No, we'll talk about it tomorrow. Tomorrow, tomorrow. I forgave my father. My father forgave me. You forgave me. I have never felt so light. Let me enjoy it. We will talk about it tomorrow after Aman Kapoor. And for now, we're enjoying it. Have some chicken. - Cesar - Tut-tut! We'll talk about it tomorrow. We'll talk about it tomorrow. Where is the guide? - In front. Here he is! - It's here ? Thank you so much. Go ahead. Can I know what you're doing? - Chut! Well, isn't that Kapoor? - No. Kapoor, he's there. - Yes? - He is. Is he a real doctor? In a real hospital? I wasn't going to take you 7000 km to come see a guy who does yoga. Come on, go. I do not feel good. - It's going to be fine. - I'm going to die. - We are here for that. - I told you that I'm going... - Arthur! Arthur ! Help! I need somebody. Help! Are you feeling better? I am sorry. I'm so sorry. Sorry for what ? You're crazy. Wait, you'll see. Wait. M. Dreyfus. Mr. Montesiho. Nice to meet you. The situation is strange. Really very strange. I have never seen that in my 20 years of career. And yet believe me, we see weird things in this country. But... is it good or is it bad? Good and bad. Your cancer has mutated. What ? Your cancer... It has evolved. What ? It has changed. I have cancer? Yes. Fuck, you're not going to begin all over. But it's a different cancer. It's no longer a lung cancer But melanoma on the leg. It is very serious. You need emergency surgery. Skin cancer? Three more months and you would be dead. He's not going to die? With an operation, he will live. Oh thank you ! Oh, thank you! You're welcome! Thank you. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! It's OK. Sit down. - You are a magician! - Thank you. I knew it ! I knew you wouldn't die! C√©sar ! C√©sar ! Cesar, stop! Cesar, stop! Stop it. ! The operation went well. They were able to remove everything. And Cesar? He'll call back. Do not worry. Give him some time. Go on, get some rest. Rest. I needed this meeting to listen, understand And then, support me a little morally. So, Arthur I was confronted, through Randa I tried to open up and understand, like you. I do not understand how I could do that. You were afraid. You know I had a great life before. Hm I wanted a kid I had a job, a guy We had been together for ten years. And we were about to buy an apartment. And then there was November 4th. I felt a lump in my left breast. And I started chemo. I didn't even understand what was happening to me. I didn't understand anything. I didn't want to talk about it. Everyone said to me: "It will be fine, it will be fine." And that's not true. It hasn't been. He left and I found myself alone. I am sorry. What I'm trying to say is that you you, you stayed. You gave up everything to be with Cesar. So yeah, you lied, you did anything but but you were there. Thank you. Shall I drop you off? Well, I'm parked there. Good. So, good evening. See you soon. Good night. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Good evening, Bernard. It's Arthur. I imagine you haven't heard from Cesar. It would be nice to call me back when you can. Thank you so much. Good night. Move! Wait, there's the dog. "How does Brasse-Bouillon nickname his mother?" "Caboche, Folcoche or Potache?" Brasse-Bouillon? What is it - a movie ? - You lost. My turn? Uh... "What is La Fouine's favorite musical genre? "Rap, slam or zouk?" - It does not mean anything. - Well yess. The favourite musical genre. - Don't you know La Fouine? - No. - And Disiz La Peste? - Who is he? - So you don't know? - No. Rap. - Do you know what rap is? - Yes. Hello? Good evening, Bernard. It was nice to call me. I wanted to tell you... He's here. But he doesn't want to see you. Yes of course. I am sorry. I tried, but he doesn't want to hear anything. At the same time it's understandable. Yes I understand. How is he ? It's okay. He's a little tired But do not worry. I take good care of him. - Yes. Thank you so much. Thanks for your call. Good evening, Bernard. Good night. Thank you so much. Hello, Randa. Hello, Arthur. It's okay ? I just heard from Cesar. I know where he is. I am a little lost. He called you? He is fine ? - If it's for a sex scene, it might be quick. - That's good, I'm in a hurry. How do you feel ? Super. If you have come for him, you are wasting your time. The first time, in the hospital, you came to see me to help Arthur. You really insisted. He thought the same. You are really beautiful, actually. Actually ? Thank you. You're welcome. I know you don't want me to talk about him, but he's better. You saved his life. I believe if he lied to you, it was to protect himself because he was afraid. It was for you that he was afraid. When you love someone, sometimes you carry the pain on you. We carry the load. Even if it's stupid and unnecessary. He ruined everything. In his place, you would have told the truth? I dunno... When I learned that I was sick, it took me weeks to say it. And I lied. All the time, everyone. It has nothing to do with me. - Yes it does. I knew the second I was about to say the word loud I was going to sow sadness and desolation. And that's what happened. He has... He just wanted to save time. I think he lost a lot. But we don't agree. I thought I saved him. I can't forgive him. I will leave you now. You will be leaving soon, you know that. Those you love will never forget those moments. What you are going to do will be with them for the rest of their life. Thank you, Randa. Goodbye. Goodbye, Cesar. - Randa ! - Fuck, Cesar Cesar - Bouh ! Are you stupid or what! - It's okay ? - I'm alright. It's him... - Not too much. Make a little less noise. Thank you. You're really stupid. But are you really stupid or what? You should have seen your face. I wasn't going to leave without saying goodbye to you, anyway. Excuse me. Excuse me. I love you too. Asshole. Me too. "Cesar was born in Algeria on independence day. He was a daddy's boy who drove a moped, collected girlfriends and had had a mustache at age 11. He was bad at everything, but had no doubts. I was bad at nothing, but I doubted everything. He was everything I wasn't, and that pissed me off. And yet, what makes friendships unbreakable, it is a feeling that love lacks: certainty. However, on 12 May 1976, the day we met it's exactly what I felt. I still remember the first sentence you said to me: "I feel like we are going to be pissed off." Obviously, this prophecy was wrong. We could not be pissed off with Cesar. He's lived his whole life like he's going to die tomorrow. He died yesterday. He's always been so in the present, how crazy it seems to me to talk about him in the past tense. I'll have to get used to it. Cesar had a thousand lives, but none made him sad. He sailed on existence, without ever being damaged by it. We say that a friend is someone who really knows you, but loves you nonetheless. He was unbearable, but you couldn't help but love him. A few months ago, going to Biarritz, you sang Gilbert B√©caud, loudly. I hear your voice. So now what am I going to do? Towards what nothingness will my life slide? You left me the whole Earth. But the Earth without you is small. Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. - Thanks, Bernard. - Thank you for everything. See you tomorow honey. See you tomorrow. Thank you. - It was very beautiful, very moving. - Thank you. He asked me to give this to you. - Ah? - Yes, you must read it now. He asked me. Okay, I will. See you soon. See you soon. Hi buddy. I wish I had been there. I love it when people talk about me. We had a good time, anyway. What happened quickly So, I have one last thing to ask you. I know it's the tenth, but I promise, then I'll stop. I would like you to do us a favor. You have in front of you the woman of your next life. She is great. You look alike. So, here's what you're gonna do You're not going to invite her, or say, "See you soon. Thank you for everything." We're no longer in fifth. You will close this letter, you are going to run after her, you're going to take her hand and kiss her. Like that, you will also have a beautiful memory of this day. Come on, go for it, asshole. You should already be running. Randa ! Are you okay ? I just wanted to tell you Hello. Arthur Dreyfus. 56 years old. I am a researcher. Because I love to search and I love to find. Hello. Randa. Can I get you a drink? Are you hitting on me? Is it showing that much ?
