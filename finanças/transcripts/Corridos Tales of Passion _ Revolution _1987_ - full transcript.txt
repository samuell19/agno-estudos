Oh, with this, I say farewell with a floater, Nicole Avelina. Here is the tragic story. The story of televisión. Speaker 19: Oh, oh. Speaker 10: Oh, the proverbial smoking pistola, sex, machismo, tragedy, all typically Mexican obsession. And. The Mexican Revolution of 1910 was the first great social upheaval of the 20th century. Many aficionados consider it to be the period of the greatest flowering of the corridor with the struggle for land and bread. People suddenly had a voice and that voice started to sing corridos about their exploits, their politics, the true to life heroes such as the angle better known as Pancho Villa. But the real unsung story lies with the women, the grandmothers of many of us. We've all for being called followers to actual combatants. Three legendary songs about three legendary women tell the story. Now they lead to a lovely dinner. These songs, together with Dispatches of an American journalist traveling with Pancho Villa back in 1940, a man by the name of John Reed now combined to give us this portrait of a Mexican woman at war, nurturing life in the face of death as a soldier, then a. Speaker 28: Just let us go make one. A-list movie I just saw Sue Goodhead Glenda Mendleson gets involved in. Speaker 29: She was a railroad woman and she had her one, he was her life, she was his love. And when Pancho Villa left Chihuahua to attack Dorion in 1914 on that hot March morning, she was at the train station in the midst of that chaotic come which sweep through Mexico like a male.

Speaker 32: In the middle of a desert on a single track, like 10 enormous trains, 10 gigantic stacks of fire by night and day that struck terror into the Federalist, 50 miles away around the trains in the Chaparral camp, 9000 men in the driver's seat, each with his horse and strips of meat, 9000 men burning heat. Speaker 33: Not no, Valentino, just like you, I'll see, you know, facil medihoney not looking so many. They said good bye to somebody who. Sarkisyan, million plus, just less say. You get formal, thank you that and I mean is. Don. All of the sudden, you're not gonna find anything. Nobody's. Speaker 8: And everybody's watching. But he's doing it even the current enemy combatants either the way admit the Myanmar sleep is only one way you're going to get over this and they're going to tell him no. What if I get killed tomorrow? No time at all. But I don't say that. I didn't mean you know, I if it was important. She's my Rijeka. Speaker 34: Is that true with those guys?

Speaker 36: Step out of. Speaker 37: But it like it been a baptism of fire. The simulation across 10 miles of 100 guerrillas in one still got to twelve hundred of coming to. Our business has been to go in to pass most of my compadres. Those who fought to the last. Facing overwhelming odds from every side in the hopeless glory of the small town of. Speaker 38: I mean, go down south for. Speaker 39: The. Speaker 40: So really close. Oh, no. Well, they call Nicolay. They are young, Mr.. Speaker 28: Youngsville. Speaker 41: And so against the Crimson Sky, a beaten, exhausted soldiers came down the hill, she was trudging along with unconscious will in the dust behind the horse of Captain Felix Romero. The 30 miles, he never, never looked back, never spoke to us, but rode on without concern. I and it's just sometimes just hang back and be grateful for her to pack. Speaker 40: With a careless. Speaker 41: Is it is it found her after the battle? And they went to bury the dead, wandering aimlessly at like a and apparently out of a hat needing a woman, he ordered her to follow and she had unquestioningly out of that place of. Speaker 42: We. Peter, you and I are still alive. Are you hungry? Tamako been on the run and fetch me some fresh water and corn that I can feed my. What a better security policy. You are the gringo that ran so many miles with the Colorados after you shoot him. No, I don't remember seeing you like Adella. You get along too long. Speaker 43: This war is no game for one. Speaker 42: It's already see from. I found this a place to sleep, your. Over in the. Speaker 44: I know this place, I remember you from the train, my loved one was killed yesterday in battle and this man, well, he's my man now, but for the love of God and all the Saints, I cannot sleep with him. This. Let me state. Speaker 45: With you. It wasn't a trace of Cocodrie in her voice. It's hardly a matter of choice. With the level scarcely cold in the ground, the thought of any man revoted, I was referring to her. Speaker 43: What was all that mattered? Thing is a the. Speaker 42: Well, you know, you you to and I don't ever I'm going with this man, I'm going to stay with him tonight. Speaker 29: Remember, this is my woman. Yes, I know she's your woman, but she's very tired and not well. And I've offered her my bed for the night. Speaker 46: No. She is my woman and I Wonder Woman, your compadre, not your compadre, the trooper and a friend to the coroneted. But if you want to kill me, I might get a little while, I will kill you. But he's not armed. I shall appeal to the court on the way they see that colonial Army Colonel Curtis Coronel is dead. You can tell me. Indigo, Indigo. He wants to steal my woman, but first I'll kill them both. And you, what do you want? When you can't take care of your vehicles, don't come running to the Karani. Weatherbee. Speaker 47: Without the slightest embarrassment, he laid down beside me on the ground. Speaker 48: The hand reached for mine. Speaker 49: And she snuggled against my body for the comforting human warmth of it when I was noticing when it's not just. Calmly, sweetly, on sleep came to me. Speaker 50: We'll see how this man's survival. Yes, I guess not that guy at 5:00 a.m. in the morning when I awoke, she was gone. I looked out morning and come dazzlingly, oh, blue and gold and having a fling trim big white clouds and windy sky. The desert brazen and luminous. She was squatting over a fire near the train, heading tortillas. Speaker 47: She nodded as I came up and politely asked if I had slept well with the end of witnessing you, are you feeding him this said, you know, también? No, no, Orquesta. She and you take such a long time to cook a little breakfast. He charamba why is there no coffee? When are you going to treat me with a little respect out of Gardel's. No, no. Don't get mad and get ready. Go south in an hour. Speaker 51: Are you going? Am I going? We say, look, see this war as all that I have left now, so I will go with this man and if he gets killed, I'll go alone. Speaker 52: But everything has changed. I can never go back to the life I once knew. And neither can my country. Speaker 7: By the way, what is your name, please? Bet that you said John won three. At least one. Speaker 53: I never saw her again since she was on the troop train heading south. A year later, she entered Mexico City triumphantly as a soldier woman. The forces of Unkovic. Speaker 54: Just like Nick was, like those guys who get in there and get shot, and that seems. Speaker 6: No one. Speaker 55: After a million murders in the revolution of 1910, 10 percent of the population of Mexico immigrated north into the United States during the waves of humanity that have come to these shores seeking safety and opportunity of America. In spite of these tragic circumstances, new ballots were still being written about life north of the border, many with a sharp sense of humor and an eye for political satire, as evidenced in this classic corrido about an illegal immigrant who came to seek his fame and fortune in the Hollywood of the 1920s. The Ballad of a Dishwasher and Corrido. The Love of Plato's. Speaker 56: I used to dream in my youth of becoming a movie star with the hordes, I came up north to discover Hollywood. Speaker 57: This young man. And God, he would be the boy that stands better than that, still make those satisfies the love of. And the thing I like.

Speaker 2: The guerrilla tradition amigos is part of the tradition of the ballot throughout the world, as long as the common people of this earth continue to sing of the joys and sorrows, the tragedies and triumphs that will always be corridos and record again and again what it means to be alive, what it means to be human, what it means to be part of the wave of humanity in the. Let's go where no, when it's not just us and so amigos, it goes on, it shall remember you and. Speaker 3: There are some. Speaker 4: For every little boy, I lost, five year old Luskin's, but.
