Chapter 1: Birth (Beginning, Origin, Creation) Hey, Ittoop! You may come inside now. Go and see them, son. They are inside. - Let's get going. - Let's step out. Careful! Hold him. Careful! Who is this? Johnnymon! Aren't you daddy's Johnnymon? [Two alarms ringing together] Why do you need to set two alarms? One is good enough, right? And this man doesn't even wake up! Now, I have to turn off the two alarms myself! Ichoy! Look at him, sleeping like a log! Ichoy! Jesus! Ichoy! I'm not dead yet! Get up, man! It's Elsymol's engagement today. Don't you remember? âª Our eyes awaken to the same dawn âª âª Inseparable, even our shadow is one âª âª The same dawn âª âª The same dawn âª [ITTOOP] âª The same dawn âª Finish it, dear. How about brother Johnny? Your brother Johnny is not here. You eat it. âª The same dawn âª Eat it, dear. We'll give something else to Johnnymon. Have this, dear. Why aren't you applying it properly, Kochu? You've spilled it here. Oh! It's alright. Leave it. Just a little is enough, Ichoy! This is very little! Look! âª The same dawn âª It's okay. It's alright. What are you doing, Ichoy? Don't move, dear. Look! I've brought such a nice Saree for my daughter. Are you applying the eye-drops properly, Ichoy? Of course, I'm doing it properly! It's just that... They have arrived! The kids have arrived! I think Elsamma is here. Dad! Come quickly! - Give it to me. - No, I will bring it. - You bring the luggage. - Okay. Get the luggage. Why did you have to bring this today, Venucha? This will work today. Just wait and see! I really hope it works! Come. - Ichoy! - Elsymol! Come here! Come! Come here! Ichamma! - Are you two done with your baths? - Did you bathe? Yes, I did! They are marrying me off, Ichamma! - Did you have the rice dumplings? - Let's have it together. We're going to make some. Hey, check whether it has been cooked properly! Huh? I've been making these rice dumplings, ever since I was as small as this dumpling, right? Stay still, Ichoy! Let me cut it. Cool! Nice! Show me your nose. No, no! That's not necessary! My dear Ichoy, my fiancÃ©e... Do you know how handsome he is? He doesn't have even a single hair in his nose. Stop it, dear! - Ichamma. - Yes. This is my start-up idea. It's been only 3 years since I retired, right? I could unleash the creativity within me only now. This is... the 'Rice dumpling machine'! - Give me your finger. - What is it, dear? Now, if you press this with your finger, you can enjoy some freshly made rice dumplings! Stop it, kiddo! He keeps coming up with random stuff to waste my time! And what do you call this machine? 'Rice dumpling machine' a.k.a. 'KOMA'! âª Time, blossoming and withering endlessly âª Oh, it's ready? âª Together we live, in harmony âª Sugar... I hope you didn't cut down the sugar. That will reduce the taste. Oh, God! Rice dumplings again? You've been having it for 70 years! Aren't you sick of it yet? Get lost! The two of us are still as healthy as horses, because of the rice dumplings she makes for us. Understood? Wow! Look at this youngster, bursting with energy! In that case, along with Elsy's wedding, shall we find a bride for Ichappan as well? Well, if she is okay with it... Get lost! Shall we look for a groom for Ichamma as well, then? This man! Elsy, Susheel. I haven't received the 'Engagement Affidavit' yet. Attention! Up next is... 'Thought for the day'. The relationship between us... should be like a rubber band. I'll pull it from one side, and you'll pull it from the other side. And it will break in the centre! Who said that? What is it? Hey, it's me. You have Elsy's 'Engagement Affidavit' with you, right? Don't come here without it. Why don't you ask your Mom? How will I know about it? We have a priest in the family, but you're of no use to us. It's unfair that I have to do everything myself! I agree that I'm her brother. But I'm a Father too, right? Is it too much to ask for some respect? [Mom calling] Wow! Cool! Superb! Come on! Next step! I'm in the middle of a shoot, Mom! I'll call you later. - Where is Elsymol's affidavit? - Hang up! More energy! - Where is Elsymol's affidavit? - What is it, Mom? Where is Elsymol's affidavit? Bride of beauty! Dancing diva! Dona-Dincy Travels! Cut! Awesome, Chechi! Once we upload this tonight, you'll be flooded with bookings! - Great! - Rs. 5000, please. - Dona! - Dincy! What are you two doing? It's already late. Did you find the time to do this only now? They are huge celebrities, Ichaya! They are available only today. You are right, Chechi! We are huge celebrities! - Pay them! - I have to do it, huh? Are you happy now that we've lost Rs. 5000? Hey, where is Elsymol's affidavit? Father Gabriel has asked us not to go there without the affidavit! Don't say that we didn't warn you! - Did he say so? - Yes. We pampered them both so much that now they've become arrogant! There's no use saying that now. Where is the affidavit? Try to remember! Where did you keep it? - Try to remember. - Affidavit... Try to remember! Affidavit... We gave it to our Guinness, right? - Yes! - Guinness? We gave it to Guinness. That's correct. Guinnu! Hey Guinnu! - What? - Come down! Where is Elsymol's affidavit? - How will I know? - What? - He doesn't know! - Oh my God! Wait! - I know where it is. - Where is it? I know it. Shall I come there? - No, no! - I will come that way! Okay! Coming! Take it. - Bro! Can I get a green bedsheet? Nice! Smile! Beautiful! Fantastic! Lie down... Get up! - Chetta, keep clicking non-stop. - Of course! Here are the flowers! - I should look awesome, right? - Throw the flowers! Wow, marvellous! - I look great, right? - Of course! Hey, You are the same age as me, right? For how long have you been married to him? 3 years. 3 years! Hey, do you guys do it... daily? Yes. - Daily! - Whoa! Bring it on, bro! Don't pull it from there. It will get detached from here. Oh! Then you do it yourself, Chechi! [Susheel] Ichappa! Aren't you ready yet, Ichappa? What are you doing? Let me finish stitching this, boys! - What stitching? - I was talking about stitching... - Keep it there. - No, no! Before entering my house, everyone who has married into my family has received a towel from me. Do you know that? There's no point in saying that now. It should be the same for my Elsymol's groom as well. Got it? But then, you haven't given a towel to Elsy's dad Venuchayan yet! Why is that? That's because he abducted my dear daughter Elsamma from me! He doesn't deserve a towel. Oh, that's the reason! - Slowly! - Come, come! - Where are you taking me? - Put him here. That's enough. Enough! Put me down! Where did you keep the affidavit, Ichappa? - Affidavit? - Elsymol's Engagement Affidavit! Affidavit? You must have kept it somewhere! Oh! Are you even hearing anything, Ichappa? Stop it, Ichoy! The kids are here, right? I shouldn't have given it to that boy! âª Spring âª About to hit a century and you're still at it? Does that mean he should stop romancing? So romantic, right? Yes, yes! Stop it, kids! Should we just stand here and talk about romance? - Find the affidavit! - Hey! Hey! Don't open my suitcase! Come, Ichappa! Let's go and change! There are many valuable items in it. - Come, Ichappa. Let's get ready. - Don't take everything out! Slowly, slowly. - What are you doing? - Where did you keep it, Ichappa? Come! They will find it. Get me that shirt. Bring it quickly! Who gave you permission to open it? - Why are you opening it? - Where is the affidavit? Let me check, Ichappa. - Wear this, Ichappa! - Hey, search over there! Search for it, Guinnu! - You don't need a belt, right? - Belt? What for? Why is this boy looking up there? Hey, search for it! Get down, you useless fellow! Woah! Woah! Ichappa! We got it only a week back. Why are you searching for it in the attic? Hey Ichappa! If we lose something, we must look high and low! Let me search up here! Yeah, right! This looks interesting. Don't get stressed. Oh! You've hidden all the good bedspreads here? I must steal these somehow! This boy has made the room all dusty! Have you got any idea where it could be? Hey! I found the affidavit! - Oh, you found it? - Thank God! Didn't I tell you... that I had kept it somewhere here? - Is this for me? - Yes. My daughter should be the prettiest person at the function today. Has Clara arrived? We are ready, right? Shall we go, elder sister? Come. Oh, Mother of God! Hey, hey! Hey kiddo! Take that ladder with you! I will take it later, Ichappa! Come! Disobedient kid! What do I say to these kids? [To my beloved Kochuthresiamma] To my beloved... Kochuthresiamma. 'Where to start... How to start... I don't know any of that.' You must have seen some fools who say so! But I am not like that! Where has she gone? - It's 9 o'clock. - They're clicking photos non-stop. What are they doing? Is this a film shoot or what? Though it hasn't been long since we met each other, what we shared between us, was much beyond friendship. And the two of us know that, very well. I should've bought a green watch too. - Sorry, sorry! - Here comes the bride! We were clicking photos. We got some superb shots! - What is this? - I was at the photo shoot! Where is Ichoy? He will come now. Ichappan is lagging behind! Don't walk in slow-motion, Ichappa - The engagement will get cancelled! - Don't listen to him! Come, Ichoy! Slowly. Praise be to Lord Jesus! Where were you, Ichoy? All of us were waiting for you! Let's stand here. Let's pray. May peace be with us. Bless them with the strength to abide by the wedding vows they have made today, to love and cherish each other until death does them apart. O' Lord Almighty! Amen! From the moment I got to know you closely, I wished that... you should be mine! Only mine! Why do we need to play this hide and seek game now? We are already late! Come. The only thing I have to offer you and your four children is the love that I could give no one else over the past four decades. Let's embark on a new life together, one that is filled with love and affection. From your own, Kochouseph.. Your attire is great! You look superb! Just a second, brother-in-law. - Will you marry me? - Oh my God! Yes, yes! - Give it. - What? Give me the ring! - Here you go. - Thank you! - Well, put it then. - Susheel! - I love you! - Oh! This girl! We're married! Not yet, you're only engaged! It's not time to leave yet. - Hello! You started eating? - Ichamma! - Look! We're engaged! - Hi. -Is it good? -Ichoy, how come you don't seem very happy? Hey Elsy! I must say, your groom is very handsome! Look at me! I have been tolerating him for around 80 years! I'm kidding! I was kidding. Oh no! I want to go home. Who will drop me? Who will drop me home? Who is going to drop me home? - There's no one to drop me? - Elsamma, come. Come on. What happened, Father Gabriel? Ichamma! What's the matter, Father? I don't know! What happened to you, Ichoy? Oh! Don't tell me then! O' Jesus! I'll manage, dear. Come. Tomorrow morning, I need all of you to be here. By morning, I don't mean your morning! I mean, my morning! Hey, you! Give me the key. - I won't give it. - Hey! - Come here! - I won't! Didn't I tell you to come after dropping him at school? How can I leave him when Ichappan asked everyone to be here? But why did Ichappan ask everyone to come here early in the morning? The partitioning was completed a while ago, right? Yeah! Elsy, I heard that Ichappan was on fire with his punch lines yesterday. My morning... Your morning! - Are there two mornings here? - I don't know anything. Did you notice, Rosechi? Ever since the prayer started yesterday, Ichappan has been feeling down. Right! And that too, when all of us got together after a long time! Come, kids! Food is ready! - Yes, coming! - I don't want it. I will have Ichamma's rice dumplings. - Dad asked me to come. What's the matter? - Oh, no! Father! Where are you running off to? Move aside! Hey, Mathu! Since your business has collapsed, why not consider investing in my 'Koma'? Who will pay our debts then, Venucha? You and your Koma-dy! Think about it once again! You're already joking this early in the morning? Ichappan is here. This... This is a love letter written fifty years ago... to my wife Kochuthresia, by some Kochouseph. What? I asked all of you to come here, to show this to you. I heard that Ichappan found a love letter from a Kochouseph, addressed to you. Is it true? Ichappa, did you gather all of us here just to show us this letter? Read it aloud, Ichappa. Let all of us hear it. Yes, read it, Ichappa! Let's hear it. Now that it's gone this far, we can't let Ichamma off the hook! No wine for Ichamma for a week! Not just a week! No wine for Ichamma for one whole year! - That's correct! - Yes! You tell us, Ichappa. What should we do for you? We will do anything for you! Shall we find that guy and bring him in front of you? Tell us, Ichappa. Whatever you want, we will get it done! We promise you! - Tell us, Ichappa! - Will you get it done? Yes, Ichappa! We promise! - Yes! - Ichappa, it's a Priest's promise! Go ahead! Tell us! What more do you need? In that case, I need only one thing. Yes, yes! Say it! Say it, Ichappa! - Say it openly! - Come on! I want to divorce her! Chapter 2: Growth (Development, Evolution) It looks like the work is moving along quickly, Ichoy! All of this is the result of your hard work, son. Xavier, why aren't you growing any taller? Mom, big brother is here! Okay. Everyone is moving from Ceylon to Persia now. - Why? - The prospects are better over there. If I stay for a couple more years, Boss has promised to send me there. Is it? If that happens, let's renovate this house as well. Right? - How are you, Annamachi? - He is Johnnykutty, my son! He's coming from Ceylon. Oh, my dear! Hey! You look really weak! That's true. You're having porridge for breakfast? - Where is my share? - Oh! I don't need your share. Sigh! I missed this so much! Who's this for? Those are some clothes for the two of you. Hey! This is a gift from me. There's no need to quarrel over towels now! All of you will have your own towels. It even has your names. This is cool! Just press it over here. It's a famous brand. It won't get damaged. Did you see this, Kochu? We don't have to turn it. We just have to shake it like this. That's cool! [Johnnymon] [Mayathattakathu] - Hey! - Yes. What do you think this is? What do you think this is? Hey! I think Ichappan wrote this himself for Ichamma long back and forgot about it. I don't think so. Come here! If this news gets out, even the wedding might get cancelled. We need to find a solution for this. This won't stop here! Hey! In my opinion, we should all get together and make this divorce happen! If it happens, the Guinness World Record for the divorce of the most elderly couple will come to our house! - Yes, that's true! - Venucha! Hey, you! I will knock your block off! I won't consider that you are my son! My dear son, I have told you a hundred times... that you were named 'Guinness' after a liquor bottle! And not for you to bring home a Guinness record! You can say all that, Dad. Now that you've named me so, I won't rest until I bring at least one record! - No use talking to him! - You are satisfied, right? this entire family is in need of a spiritual retreat, and it's high time to arrange one. Yeah, right! In my opinion, we don't have to take this so seriously. Let's consider this as one of Ichappan's jokes and forget it. Yes. But what if it's true? If it's true and we pursue it, what will happen? We will lose face in front of everyone. We will be in a pickle with court cases! My daughter's wedding won't happen. And what if it's not true? We will lose face in front of everyone. We will be in a pickle with court cases! My daughter's wedding will still be cancelled. Do you want me to help you? What's the plan? We're calling a lawyer, right? - Yeah, right! - Hey, tell him. Ichappa! Just draw a cross and go to sleep. This madness will go away once you wake up in the morning! They are right. This is not going to happen, Ichappa! Go and lie down, Ichoy. So, no one is going to support me, is it? - No! - No! No one is going to support you for this, Ichappa. Fine! I don't need anyone's support! Happy? Ichappa! Move! Careful! I don't need anyone's support! This is the end of it. There won't be any further discussion regarding this, inside the house and outside too! Understood? Yes. You heard it, right? Move your body with Susheel! Your body, my moves! Move it! Move it! [Meanwhile, outside...] Hey, did you know? Mayathattakathu Kochuthresia had an extra marital affair long back, it seems! Hey, grandma had an affair! I'm not sure. So, don't tell anyone! Hey, grandma had an affair! I'm not sure. So don't tell anyone! Hey, grandma had an affair! Don't tell anyone! I will tell everyone! What all am I hearing? This is a disgrace to our Diocese! - Hello? Who is this? - What? - I am your Bishop! - What? At his age, why does your Ichappan want to get a divorce? Has he gone nuts? Go! Go! Go! Go! Faster! Faster! - Well... that... - What? - Who told you this? - Who's left to know about this? Even the dogs and cows in town are talking about it! If my findings are correct, there isn't any truth to this. Ammini, I think Ichappan is delusional! There's something sorrowful about Ichamma's cowfeed today. - Yes, yes. - Poor thing! Very true! You...! The whole town knows about it! And you still want to marry her? Both her and her grandma are sluts! Hereafter, our family has nothing to do with their family. Understood? I don't want to hear anything! Didn't you promise me when you sent me here for higher studies... that you'd get me married off once you retire, if I don't study well? How many exams did I fail? It's been three years since you retired, right? - Did you marry me off yet? - Bishop... I was trying to force everyone... - Force? - Not by force! I'm trying to gather everyone together for a spiritual retreat. What bloody good will that bring? - They will get reformed. - Will they? Yes, yes! 1:1. Now it's balanced. [Meanwhile, inside...] O Guinness Gods, please bless our Ichappan. Ichappa, what are you going to gain by getting a divorce at this age? Shall we talk this over and solve it? Ichamma, we need to know! Is there any truth in that letter? She had this affair when she was the mother of my four children! And you want me to talk this over and solve it? If it's true, we need to know it now! Shucks! Don't you have any shame... to ask this to your mother's face? Shameless! Aargh! It's getting ridiculous how often the power keeps going off. What if they don't get reformed? I will flee to Vatican! Dear, I'm going to Vatican anyway. You can come along with me. You can study in some parallel college and get settled over there. I won't consider that you are a Priest! Why don't any of you love me? I wanted to marry some rich guy, take care of his child, and live happily! You can't stand that, right? Hey, don't you want to live an independent life? What will you all gain if I become independent? Should I take care of you all? Mom! Dad worked hard for so long in Dubai and made all that money! Who is it for? This guy... This guy is in the church, right? Why does he need money? I don't need it. I swear! Ichamma, is that Kochouseph a real person? Stop wasting time and tell us the truth. Whatever it is, just tell us, Ichamma! [starts chanting prayer] Oh shucks! Oh, it's back? Her wedding got cancelled because of this, Ichappa! Well, she isn't old enough to get married yet. Hey, girl! You should go to some foreign country, study there and become really successful, okay? Ichappa! Do you know how hard it was for me to woo that guy? I even learned to make his favourite snack! I want to get married! What is it? Here you go! Oh no! Hey, Mathayi! What are you doing here? 'Light is sadness, - darkness is Jayaprabha!' - What? How is it? We learned it in school yesterday. Cool, right? It's not Jayapradha! It's Philomina! This is an actual power outage. It wasn't me. If there was a Guinness record for power outages, our town would win it. Shut up! Don't talk! [alarms ringing] I thought I'd talk to you once you've calmed down a bit. Before reading that letter in front of our children and grand children, you could have asked me once! Oh! I couldn't do it. Well, if I ask you now, will you tell me the truth? What should I say? You calm down first. Me not calming down is the issue now? Tell me the truth. Who is he? My dear Ichoy! After all, we've been living together in this house for so long. Yes. I'm asking you because we've been living together for so long! Who is this Kochouseph of yours? Tell me! See! You don't want to tell me the truth. I don't want to live with someone who doesn't want to tell me the truth. We have been living in this house for almost 80 years! If you look carefully enough, you may come across many things here that are unanswered or have been forgotten. It's on the other side, dear Mathayi. - Here? - Yes. Check there. Where can it go? Not there. Down there! - It's not here, Ichappa. - Check the lower rack. - Found it! - Found it? Bring it to me. Now, open it. Doctor... Hospital... Electrician... Which one should I read out? Lawyer! Advocate! The last time we came here was for the partitioning. Hey! This is the way! Come on! Why does a house need this many doorways? - He attends only decent cases. - So many doorways! Ring the door bell! Your Ichappan has called every lawyer in the bar council! He even started calling judges, mixing up numbers. Phew! Dear, tell them about different types of divorce cases and their possibilities. There are two types of divorce cases. One is 'Mutual' in which both parties agree to a divorce. It's a simple process. The court grants it without much hassle. The next one is 'Conditional' in which one party wants it and the other doesn't. That's quite tough. Ichamma is not interested in this divorce. This is Ichappan's madness. That's not what I'm thinking. After this, two children will stay with Mom for two weeks... and two children be with Dad. Even the twins might be separated, right? Hey Advocate! You keep mocking us always! Enough with it! This is our family matter. We will resolve it ourselves. Don't share this with anyone. That's all! As if they don't know it already. Even the dogs and cows in this town know about it! It was the fish seller who told me about it! Get up! Let's go! Such a waste of time! Come on! These jobless lawyers will cause trouble for us! I got a little too excited! - Such an indecent fellow, right? - Yes. My legal argument didn't work with them, right? Yes, but you proceed! Good that there are so many steps. They wouldn't have reached downstairs yet. Hey Murali! I mean... Venu! Not a single lawyer whom Ichappan called is willing to accept this case. Separating a couple who are both in their 90s could harm the lawyers' reputation. You don't have to worry at all! He can only fight the case if he manages to find a lawyer. Please drop me at the factory on the way. Okay, Chechi. Where have you brought me? Five minutes! Wait. Susheel! [Susheelam Day Care & Zumba] Long time, no see! We met three days back, right? Susheel... Guinness, this is my space. What? Guinnu! It serves as a kindergarten during the day, and as a Zumba class at other times. He is an entrepreneur! An entrepreneur! See! "Susheelam Day Care"! Where has he gone? - Hey Xavier! - What is it, Ichappa? Hey, apply this on my body. Apply this on my back! Ichappa... I... I called you because my hands can't reach my back! Ichappa... that... I'm asking you to do it! I will be right back, Ichappa. I will do it. Not necessary! Bloody hell! Who are you? If you need donations, there's nothing here! - I don't need donations. - Then? - Prayers! - Oh! Praise be to God Jesus! I was sent by the Priest from the Church. Thought I'll meet the Grandpa and Grandma here, and pray with them. It's been a while since they visited the Church, right? - Oh, are you a Brother? - Yes. Please have a seat. Well, It's okay. I will sit on that platform. As you wish. That must be Grandma, right? No, that is Grandma's daughter. Oh, the eldest one? - No, the eldest was a son. He was very smart, but he died in a shipwreck a long time ago. After that incident, she was the one who took care of the family. Who else do you think was behind the growth of our rubber band factory? She was not like this earlier. There was a time when she used to keep Ichappan in line as well. But now... That... shucks! She has "Asimer's disease"! She doesn't remember anything. We can't stop fate, right? What else to say? Hey, stop it! - Is this why you asked to see me? - What are you doing? We both are wearing green! We will rock! - Sheesh! Elsy! - What? Hey! Open the door! Have you locked it? Are they making out? Hey, leave me! What are you... This wasn't the reason I asked you to come. Then? My parents don't want us to get married! Doesn't your grandpa have anything else to do in his old age, other than this divorce? So, you don't want to marry me? Oh no! My buttons are broken! My dear Susheel, I will stitch it for you! Tell me! Don't you want to marry me? If I don't want to, will I take the risk of bringing you here? Phew! I thought you didn't want to marry me. Yeah, right! Praise be to Lord Jesus, Grandpa! Praise be to Him, now and always! He has come from the Church. I sense that there's a great sadness within you, Grandpa. Why don't you make a confession? Not to me. Just imagine that you are confessing to Jesus! Let's sit in that room. Okay. Or... let's sit in this room. Hey, open this room. Okay. - Come inside. - There's no hurry, Grandpa. Kochuthresia and I have been married for almost 80 years now. Well, what can I do? I never expected this. I love her more than anything else! What is all this? I'm making notes of the confession. Notes... notes. - Oh! - You may continue. How many boyfriends have you had? Well... that... There have been too many to count on my fingers. What? - Can't count? - What about you? Well... Well, I can count that on my fingers. You are handsome! Elsy! Elsy! Open this door, Elsy! Susheeletta! Elsy! Mom had called! They have left from the Church. They will reach in ten minutes. They will beat me to pulp today! That's it? A lawyer can easily get you a divorce. All the lawyers I know are dead. Have you heard of 'God's will', Grandpa? What? I am a lawyer, Grandpa! Where's the cord? Junior! Separating a couple who are both in their 90s could harm the lawyers' reputation. You don't have to worry at all! He can only fight the case if he manages to find a lawyer. Which foolish lawyer will take up this case? âª Contempt âª âª Mockery âª âª Severance âª âª Roar at me, let your voice take flight âª âª No more scorching heat, I've been my own might âª âª You are a mere charioteer, I am a warrior âª âª An eight-legged octopus, undefeated, unconquered âª Here. Yes, press it. Come! - Once again. Press harder. - Who is this? Come, come. - Who is it, Xavier? - He said he's from the Church. From the Church? - Who is it from the church? A Brother? - Who are you? - Who are you? - Where? Let me see him. There's no such person in my Church. We don't have black robes either. Tell me the truth! Who are you? Stop it! Stop it right there! This is the document that proves that I'm your father's lawyer. Come here! Give me that document! - I won't give it! - Venu, let go of that boy! If you manhandle me, I will file a case against you under section 503! Move aside! Hey kiddo, what's wrong with you? Are you crazy to support Ichappan's madness in this old age? Crazy? I am crazy? Your father has raised a serious issue, and you seem to be brushing it off. So, aren't you crazy? Have you ever thought whether there's any truth to what he's saying? Have you ever tried to see from his point of view? You should understand something. You're talking about something that happened 50 years ago! Yes, exactly! That's my point! What's your name? - Elsamma. - Yes! 50 years! The life your father lived for the past fifty years, was a lie! How will you react if you realize that... half of your life was a lie, as you approach your final days? Tell me! Come on, tell me! - Tell me, Father! - What? Answer me! You don't have an answer! No one has an answer! You don't seem to care even if this man dies... without finding the answer to the greatest question in his life! You are only concerned about your daughter's wedding, house warming, lent and your family name, right? Pathetic! Lent? So pathetic! I will take up your Dad's case! I will appear in court on behalf of your Dad! If you are planning to stop me, I'll see you in court! High five! Move aside! Where is my bag? Move! See! The lawyer came here searching for me! That's what! The truth is on my side! And God too! Wait and watch! - Elsamma! - What? We need to find out whether God is on our side, right? Breathe... and relax. A wedding! I can see it clearly. But... a wedding getting cancelled... I can see that too, very clearly! Hey, Angelo! Do you see anything? I don't see a damn thing! Our eyes are closed, right? Shut up! A Divorce. I can see that clearly. But... A divorce getting cancelled... I can see that too, very clearly! Oh! This is like the weather forecast we used to hear on the news - it could rain, or it might not. - Rosammachi! - Then what? Is there a solution for this? Solution! - No solution! - Oh! Great! Things are going to get even more complicated! There's a registered letter for Kochuthresiamma! It's the divorce notice, isn't it? Ichamma... All this while, I have obeyed whatever you've told me, and I've come along with you, wherever you called me. Now, if you're calling me to the court, I will come there as well. [reading an excerpt from 'The Ramayana'] Where have you reached? In order to prove Sita's purity, Lord Ram asked her to jump into the fire! We'll know the result tomorrow. Ever since I can remember, they've been deeply in love. Ichappan pampered me a lot while raising me. Did this happen because of my carelessness? Could I have done something? I don't understand anything, Venucha. You were just five or six years old then, right? What could you possibly do? Nothing. Well, since things have gone this far, shouldn't we find a lawyer for Ichamma? Yes, definitely. We'll have to find the best lawyer money can buy! Hey, don't try to come upstairs! I've locked the room! I won't allow any indecent case inside my chamber! Go away! You came to your family lawyer as a last resort, after being unable to find anyone else, right? My chamber will not accept any indecent case from such indecent people! - Go away! - Please, Sir! Forget him! Let's go! - Him and his decency! - Go away! Who does he think he is? - Juice... - It's not cold, right? Give it to him. Let his head cool down! Okay then. It was orange juice. Missed that as well! You sit here talking about decency. Ever since Jikku left, our cow Ammini hasn't been giving milk. I will milk the cow, Ramani! Oh! Is that why you've built a glass palace? It's a chamber, not a palace! - Don't get me talking! - Ramani! Have any of your junior lawyers won any case yet? No. So, you know everything! Well... Ramani... Well, tell me what to do. I will do it! Yes, your honor. Yes, your honor! Yes... I object... I object! I object, your honor! I object. I rest my case for your honor Case, your honor. I plead for my client. I plead... I plead for my client! Yes. Ichappa, we can go back, even now. If we go any further, it will be difficult to turn back! - Listen, Mr. John. - Sir. I only take on cases that I am confident I can win. - That's all, your honor! - Stop! That's all... That's all... your honor. Objection sustained. Excuse me! This man! - Jose. - Sir. On a daily average, how many litres of milk will a Jersey cow give? - Well... that... - Leave it. How about a Sindhi cow? Oh, how will you know that? Only a milker would know that, right? Oh! The milker was here? Sorry. Advocate Jikkumon! You will dare to appear against me in court, huh? Well, Mr. Junior Jose... In the case that we are going to win today, you will have the opportunity to learn a lot from my arguments. You should learn everything by-heart. Judicial system needs a change. I know this guy who's hanging his head in shame. Jikkumon! Hey, why are you here? My dear Ravi! Are you the new judge here? Yes, I got transferred here. Such a nice place, right? Very sunny and no shade around! - Where can I get good pork here? - What? Pork, pork! You haven't changed at all! All clear on the digestion front? It's going great! You came at the right time, bro! This is my first case. I must win it somehow! Don't talk to me like this. I became a lawyer by copying from your answer sheet, right? Won't I show the gratitude for that? You haven't forgotten anything! I won't forget! You don't even have to plead in court! You have won this case! You have won! Okay? - Will you plead? - I won't! You shouldn't! Yes! Yes! Yes, sir! Yes! âª Say Hi to the Highness Ravi âª âª The ruler of this court's decree âª âª His word, final and true, will be âª âª Your destiny, he'll rewrite with glee âª Do you really need a divorce at this age, Grandpa? Don't you want to reconsider this? Do you want to reconsider? Please inform him that I made this decision after thoughtful consideration. He made this decision after thoughtful consideration. Grandma, do you want to go through with the divorce? My client has no interest in pursuing this divorce, Your honor. My client is interested in pursuing this divorce, Your honor. On what grounds, do you need this divorce? Grounds... Adultery! Infidelity! I object, your honor! He is defaming my client! How can true events become defamation? - Sit down. - What? Your honor, this advocate is asking me to sit down! - Mr. Jikkumon! - Yeah, Bro! Are you even an advocate? Please get up! I'm not asking you to consider their age or health condition. Based on this single piece of paper, should you be trying to separate this couple who have lived together for almost 70 years, with five children and ten or twelve grand-children? Don't you have anything to say? Don't you have any arguments? Speak, Jikkumon! Come on! Cat got his tongue, I guess. You asked me not to plead... Answer me! Well Sir, it's not for me. It's this Grandpa who needs the divorce! Oh! Is that so? When you put forth such a strong allegation, you should at least have the bare minimum evidence for it, right? One evidence as the bare minimum? - One evidence! - Once more? Bare... Don't you know the meaning of 'bare minimum'? - 'At the very least'! - Yes, bare minimum! - Yes. - One evidence! Sir... that letter... That letter is a love letter written by Kochouseph to Kochuthresia. May I interject, your honor? No, you cannot! Your honor, this advocate is at it again... Your honor, in my knowledge, there are at least 37 Kochuthresias in this locality! Sorry, 36! One Kochuthresia died yesterday! - Is it? - Yes, in Olassa. Some Kochouseph wrote a letter to one of those Kochuthresias. How can that be my client, your honor? This is a baseless accusation, your honor. Please dismiss this case, your honor! - No! - No? Yes! - Kochouseph wrote to Kochuthresia... - Blah blah blah! The love letter which Kochouseph wrote to this Kochuthresia... If this is not that Kochuthresia, which Kochuthresia is that? Jikkumon, Jikkumon, Jikkumon! Who wrote this letter to whom and why? Is there any evidence for that? It's a letter, Sir! I'm not talking about circumstantial evidence. Do you have any solid evidence? Isn't that solid evidence...? Without solid evidence, the court cannot move ahead with this case! That's it! Next! - Solid... - It's over. Hey, you! Hey... Hey! What the hell was that? Lower your voice, Jikkumon! I am a judge! What all were you saying? 'Don't fight the case. You've already won!' And when you went inside... 'Speak up, Jikkumon!' 'Answer me, Jikkumon!' - Sir, is there a problem? - What a show-off! It's the rehearsal for Bar Association's drama. It will be over soon. Jikkumon, you know that my father is an Oracle at the temple, right? So what? When he is outside the temple, he is a drunkard, but once he enters, he transforms into God! When I sit on that chair, I am in that same situation! I don't know what it is! I feel possessed by righteousness! I don't like it. But what can I do about it? Possessed by righteousness? Jalaja! - Hey Jalaja! - Hey Ravi! I'm coming! - Why is he taking so much time? - Yes. Shucks! Let's go fast. It's late. - Let's hurry. I got a little late, dear! - Let's go. - We will get pork today. - Let's go. - Go forward! Go forward! - Hey Micheal-Angelo! - Yes. Don't worry at all! From where will that fool bring evidence for something that happened 60 years ago? With this, the case is closed! It's over! Your words are final, and there is no room for appeal. Get in, Micheal! - We should have a blast today! - Here you go! Anyway, it ended well! I told you earlier, didn't I? Hey, you know how happy everyone is? Are they boozing? Yes, a lot! - You are relieved now, right? - Yes. I believe that all the issues have been resolved now. Hey, which color do you prefer for our wedding theme, green or blue? No? How about Magenta or purple? - Just a minute. - No, no! Let's fix yellow! Hello? Elsy? Hello? Ichamma. This blanket is full of dust. It needs a wash. You can leave, dear. - Ichamma... - You may leave, dear. No one is ready to listen to me! [indistinct chatter] Grandpa, do you think that... I can win this case? No. Oh! Don't say that. What should I say then? Well, though I argued a lot saying... 'Kochuthresia is this', 'Kochuthresia is that...' etc., I don't think Grandma has... Grandpa, are you sure that... what you're claiming has happened? Are you on her side or mine? The court has only adjourned the case. The case hasn't been dismissed yet. Understood? You go and bring the evidence! This happened almost 60 years ago, right? It's not possible to produce evidence so quickly. If you can't do it, tell me! I will hire another lawyer! We both know that no other advocate will take up this case! Hey! Can you produce the evidence? Can you? Don't come back until you have found the evidence, understood? You're not allowed in this house, until you bring proper evidence. Understood? Elsy! The divorce got... Oh, sorry! Wrong person! Elsy, It's really hot, right? I never expected that the case would get adjourned. Sigh! We missed a great opportunity to create a Guinness record, right? Can you just shut up, Guinness? What happened to her? Hey! Hey, don't run! You might slip! Hey! Hey, stop! I was just joking. It's a joke for the spectators. But the two of them... are really sad! Elsy! Hey! Sister... The entire family just wants to avoid legal proceedings. Not a single person... Not a single person is interested to know what happened! Hey, I am interested! I swear on my Guinness Gods that I want to know what happened! Really? Yes. Then, come with me. We need to meet someone. Come. No, no! It's not possible! No way! These are all legal procedures! It can't be done this way. Don't enter my house! - Is this his house? - Oh, this guy! I checked that letter thoroughly. There is nothing in it. - Relax. - But just show it to us! No! That is evidence! Get up! Stop playing games and give us the letter! - Get lost! - Wait, wait. My dear lawyer, we went through so much trouble to find this place. Give it to us. Please! What did you call me? Lawyer... Come, sit. Here you go. Hey, Jikku! Jikku! I don't care if you are a lawyer! I will file a court case against you if you don't pay the rent! Tell me if you have any cows in your house. I will milk them for you! That's all I can do now. What's happening with your treasure hunt? It has his name and family name. - Shall we try with that? - Yes. I had already tried all that. Family name? Where is it? "There will always be a room kept vacant for you in 'Puthenveedu'." Didn't you see it? He has just mentioned that he has a new house [Puthenveedu], right? Silly girl! No wonder you are sitting here like a dairy cow! 'Puthenveedu'... That's his family name. Puthenveettil Kochouseph! Who should we ask about events that occurred 50 years ago? Well, we do have someone in our house... who only knows about events that occurred fifty years ago. Hey, go and inquire at the place mentioned in the letter. We'll be back soon. Go, do your job! Yeah, yeah! [Vintage Malayalam song playing on radio] Puthenveettil Kochouseph! I don't know such a person. Oh, yeah! But there's one person who would know that. My brother, Johnny. Johnny will tell you everything, precisely. - Shall we leave? - Yes. Okay. Whom will we ask next? We will have to ask her brother Johnny next! Get lost! Hey, wait! We had a music teacher. - That music teacher's name... - Yes? His name was Kochouseph! Hey...! - Come! - Yes! Hello. Yes. I'm making rounds of the village office. They are saying that they don't know anything. They are asking me to check at some church. We'll come there now. Start searching for music teachers! Kochouseph is a music teacher! Hold this. Go quickly! Music teacher! Hey! What's up? I checked all the churches in this area. This is the only one left. Okay. You park it over there. Yes... Kochouseph, our music teacher... from Puthenveedu! Yes. He used to sing in the choir here. He was the headmaster of a school. But he was better known as a music teacher. Okay. He stays nearby. I can introduce you to him, if you want me to. - Come up. - Okay. - Okay. - This way. What are you waiting for? Come! Hey! Come up! Come. [Puthenveettil Kochouseph] He was a great musician! I come and sit here during certain nights. For what? To hear him sing! If you buy a liquor bottle and place it on his grave, he will sing all night! Over there... Where was it? There's a Saramma over there. She is a great dancer. Sometimes, she wakes up and dances till sunrise! Hey kiddo! Aren't you coming here? Hey! Come! Shucks! He doesn't want to come! Should I stand over there? No? Elsy, I will be near the vehicle. Well, are you... leaving? We searched so much only to find a dead man. Hey, shall we go and check at that Puthenveedu house? Someone over there might remember something! - Should we do it? - Why? Something doesn't seem right! Should we really go there? You were acting so brave in the afternoon! - Come on man! - He's useless! - Are you coming? - Follow us! Yes. Chetta! Chetta! Where is Puthenveedu? Puthenveedu! How do we reach Puthenveedu? Puthenveedu! Are you going to the haunted house? Yes. What? Will anyone go there at this hour? Just go straight. Don't forget the way back! - Thank you! - Come. Let's go, check it out. - Should we go? - Hey, follow us! - Hey, I think this is the place. - Yes. - Yes. - There it is, Jikku. Yes, this is it. Puthenveettil... Puthenveettil! Novelty is only in the name! Hey! Aren't you coming? Come! Chetta, isn't anyone here? Is there anyone here? Who is it? Chetta, isn't this Kochouseph's house? Yes. He used to come to our house to give music classes... to our grandmothers. Oh! Students! Come! Come inside! - Hey, come. - Come, dear. - You too. - No, I will stand here. - Come! - It's alright. Well, how did you find this house? We had gone to the church. They told us. Well, Dad still goes to the church to sing. Did you see that? What? Where? Who? Chetta, who is this? He is my Grandpa. Kochouseph. He was a great singer. He had trained numerous pupils in music. Anyway, I will call the person you came to meet. Dad! Dad, you have guests today! Come here before they leave! He went inside to call this guy! Didn't I tell you that this place is not safe? There are some problems here! Let's go somewhere else today, dear sister! And come back tomorrow morning with some more people. - Can you be quiet for some time? - This doesn't feel right. Hey, this is not the guy we thought he was! This guy died in 1974. He was 92 years old then. The letter was written almost 60 years ago. 60 years ago, he was around 80-85 years old. Did our grandma fall in love with an 85-year-old man? But he is Kochouseph... and this is Puthenveedu! And he is a music teacher too! Something is wrong! What? What? What is it? What happened? Get down. - Get down! - No! Why do you want to see me? What is this noise over here? Why are you shivering? Keep that cross away and get down! No, no. Who is this, Chetta? Kochouseph, my Dad. You came to see him, right? Kochouseph, the music teacher. Then, who is this? That is my Grandpa! I told you earlier, right? - So. what is his name? - That's the irony. Both father and son have the same name! Kochouseph! And they had the same profession. Music teacher! That's all? Tell me why you have come here. Grandpa, my name is Elsy. I am from 'Mayathattakam' family. Around 60 years ago, did you write a love letter to my Grandma? Hey, I think we've got the wrong person. Come. Sorry, Grandpa! Sorry, Chetta! - Hey... but... - Don't stand there. Come! Kochuthresiamma! - Hey! - Yes! These should be delivered tomorrow. - Okay. - Look here! You should keep a tab of all this. Are you paying attention? Yes, Mom! Seven... Hey, hold this! - Hold it! - Ittooppichaya! Hey Gopi! There's a telegram for you, Ittooppichaya! A telegram? Oh, yes! It must be from Johnnymon! He left for Persia, two weeks back. Read it aloud. Hey, I don't know English. That's why! Read it. Ittooppichaya, Johnnymon... Johnnymon? Johnnymon didn't reach Persia. What? Huh? Is he still in Ceylon? The ship that Johnnymon boarded to go to Persia... That ship sank! Chapter 3: Blight (Fatigue, Paleness, Decay) Tell us the matter, Advocate! Come quickly! Follow me! Grandpa! Hold the vehicle! Hold it! Grandpa! - Move aside, Chetta! - We found the man! I found the evidence! We've found the man! - We've found the man! - Hey! - What business do you have here? - Get lost! - I will take care of Grandpa. Move aside! - Mind your words! - You get lost! - Huh? We found the man who wrote the love letter to Grandma! He is 40 kilometres away. He is still alive! Come, let's go to Grandma. He is still alive! Is he deaf or what? He is still alive! Don't go there now, Ichamma. - What is it? - Nothing. You sit here and eat, Grandma. Let's not go there now. - Me! This Jikkumon... I was certain that this grandma had done something questionable. - I found it! He is still alive! Kochouseph, the secret lover! Infidelity! First class infidelity! Get my walking stick! Hey! Give my car key to him. Give me the key! - Is that necessary, Ichappa? - Do as I say! - Give it to him! - Give it, give it. I will give it. It's in the shed. Hold this bag. It contains essential items. Don't lose it! Him and his bag! Move, move, move! - Jikku! - Jikku! Move, move, move! Get in, Ichappa! Let's go. Okay. Make it fifty, at least. - The neighbours got 75. - That's not possible, Chetta. Forty! Even 40 is too much, at this remote place! Come, Ichappa! Open the door. - Bloody door! - Where is he? There! Over there! Go and ask him, Grandpa! - What is the matter? - Wait. Move aside. Hey, Kochouseph! Hey, Kochouseph! Mr. Kochouseph! Kochouseph! Ichappa, he is the man! He is the culprit! Are you Kochouseph? What's the matter? What is it? You want to write a love letter, huh? Oh no! Don't beat him! Murder case! It will be a different case then! Tell me the matter! - Don't you know it? - Tell me! Don't you know it? I will make you say it! You don't know me! But you know my wife Kochuthresia, right? - Yes! - Hold them back! It was me who wrote the love letter to Kochuthresia! It was not for nothing! We were deeply in love! You...! You were in love? What was going on between the two of you? - Take it easy, Ichappa! - What was it? - Say it! - Let go of me! Hold them back! - Ichappa! Hey, Ittoop! Go home, Ittoop! Or else, you'll have to hear things that you shouldn't be hearing in public. Go back inside! This is what happens when a woman dares to venture out. That poor man's fate is such! Poor Ichappan! I wonder how he tolerated it. Having an affair is so cheap! This is exactly why I believe that we should never get married. So, it was not just sorrow in Ichamma's cow-feed. There's guilt too, right? Unbelievable! Yes. The people were right, Bishop! It was infidelity indeed, Bishop! What about my Vatican trip, Bishop? Where were all of you? Move my bed to this room. I am going to sleep there hereafter. What did you say? Oh! I forgot to wear it! I'll be right back, Mom. I am telling you guys! He is still alive, Ichamma! Ichappan went and met him. Ichamma, we need to talk. After Johnnymon's death, I made a mistake. Don't ask me anything more. No one has anything left to say now, right? Wow! We reached so quickly, Jalu. Jikkumon! Jikkumon! Jikku, you've arranged the evidence, right? If so, shall we move ahead with a contested divorce? Don't talk to me! Don't say that! Didn't I tell you that I will solve everything? This is my first case. I must win it somehow. After milking cows for so long, my hands smell like milk! Is it? - Wow! Milma! - Milma? Dude, I always enter the courtroom thinking about you. But I have no idea why... When I sit on that chair... Do this. Don't sit on that chair today. What? Don't sit on that chair today. Yes! You have won! Sharath! Sunil! All good? It was the lack of evidence... that made me think that this case wasn't strong enough, so far. But with the tireless efforts of Advocate Jikkumon, this case has taken a new turn! It's true that there is evidence, Sir. But we should consider their age too, Sir. Does being elderly mean Grandpa should lose his rights as a citizen of this country? - Never! - Be it 18 or 100, the law of this country is the same for everyone! Ravi, Ravi! What were you saying, Advocate Narayanan? Well, whether their age should also be considered... Yes! We should definitely consider that! Right? Okay then. Congrats! Jikkumon! Where are you going, Jikkumon? Jikkumon! Where were we? Let's send them for marriage counselling. Let them talk to each other and try to resolve their issues. Yes. Jikkumon! Sorry, Jikkumon! Sorry! Please forgive me! Sorry! Sorry! Okay? Jalaja! Married life is really tough. You'll need to be prepared to face problems constantly. But... real, successful partnerships are formed... when partners confront these issues without resorting to separation. Grandpa! Grandpa! It's me! There shouldn't be any kind of cooperation from your side... during the marriage counselling. Okay. We will win this case only then. - Okay? - Okay. Okay, good night! Grandpa, I am writing a book, 'How to boost the love between partners?'... and the first chapter will be about grandma and you. I will solve your problem, for sure! Hey, kiddo! How old are you? I turned 28, this April. How about your dad? My dad is 63 years old. My youngest daughter is older than your dad! Understood? - Get out! - What? Get out! - Well, Grandpa... - Get out, I say! - Get out! - Don't hit me, Grandpa! - Get out! - Grandpa... - Get out! - Well, Grandpa... - Grandpa? Whose Grandpa? - Please don't hit me! Here comes the counsellor. - He is brilliant! - And handsome too! So, counselling didn't work, huh? How will it work, Sir? There are troublemakers here who create problems even during counselling! My dear judge, the least we can do is to arrive at a decision in this case, at the earliest. Trying to change Grandpa's mind at this age is foolishness! That's true. Oh, Goddess! - There's no point in wasting time. - No point! What kind of a solution is that, Sir? Sir... What kind of a solution is that? Sir, you know that... couples are given 3 or 6 months of trial separation, in similar cases. We haven't even provided them with that in this case. This couple doesn't need that! They lived together for 80 years, right? They're not going to do anything more in a couple of months. You move aside, Sir! Is that for you to decide? - Yes, of course! - Wait, wait. Advocate Narayanan has a point. - What? - Yes. To take an immediate decision, it's not a foul in a football game, right? - Yes. - It's the life of a couple, right? That's not what we discussed. That's what we discussed! Let the case go through normal proceedings. 6 months trial separation! - Thank you, Sir! - I'm back! Let me go and tell them before this fool changes his mind! Though he's crazy, he is sensible. Oh God! Wherever he sits, it becomes a problem! - Listen, Micheal. - I am Angelo! Sorry! Listen, Dona. I am Dincy! It doesn't matter! Too many twins to keep track of. 6 months of trial separation. That means, Grandma and Grandpa will be made to live separately for 6 months... to see whether they'd have a change of heart. What all are you saying, advocate? That won't work. You will see! With this, you'll get an item that you've never gotten until now. Guinness record! No? Time! A time period of six months! The case won't move forward during this period. It will be stuck! You can get this girl married during that period. By then, people will forget all about it! If Grandpa gets to know that he might see another baby in the family, he might even withdraw this case! What do you think? Tell me, twins! What do you think? Tell me! What do you think? Huh? I can't wait for 6 months! She had this affair while she was living in this house! I want to leave this house at the earliest. Where is my chair? It's missing! You have changed a lot. The Ravi I knew was never like this. True! You do have some minor issues. - Yes, there is some minor issue. - Yes. But I will do something today. You just have to stand by me. I'll always stand by you. - But there's something wrong with me! - It's nothing. Just stand by me. That's all. - There is nothing else. - Really? Oh! Within the short span of my life so far, I've always attempted to do things rapidly and in an unconventional manner. It's not right to torture them like this using the Indian Penal System. Look at their faces. The court building has a lot of stairs, right? Are you saying that they should walk up and down these stairs every time? No, not at all! How can that be justified? How is it fair? What good can come of it? Hard-hitting! A trial separation of six months is not necessary. Sir! Considering special privilege, the court's decision is to have the final hearing within 2 weeks! Yes! Don't say that while standing, Sir! Sit down and say it, Sir! - Sit here and say it, Sir! - Don't sit, don't sit! - Sir! Everything will be solved if you sit down. Where is this guy's chair? - No, no! - Sir! Sir! Get lost! - Please! - Should I take this chair? Please sit on some chair and say it, Sir! Do you know what loneliness feels like, Ichoy? I know it. Come, dear. âª Tender shoots, do you wither away âª âª As summer's delay prolongs the day? âª In a way, it's good, dear. It will all be over soon, right? Go to sleep, Ichamma. âª Does each petal fall, despite the root retaining the water's haul âª Hey! They have been married for 80 years. Most people don't even live that long! If this has happened between them... Oh! You made this dirty again? - I will wash it. It's okay. - Susheel! Are you listening to me? Nothing of that sort will happen between us. We are awesome, right? Have we ever annoyed each other? No. But that's also a problem, right? There are many things I'd like to discuss with you before the wedding. But I don't even know what those are! Elsy... It's quite normal to be scared before the wedding. This fear will go away once we get married. Well, that's what married folks have told me! We will figure it out. Okay? Relax. Come. Don't worry. âª Is the sky turning dark, before the fall of night? âª âª Oh birds, won't you fill it with melodies, light? âª Hey. That letter was found when they searched for my Engagement Affidavit, right? When they tried to delay the court case for our wedding, it ended up getting advanced! I don't know. I feel like all this is happening because of me! I had a tough time convincing my mother, okay? This issue won't make much noise any more. You just relax. Hey Susheel, you know how important they are to me, right? My dear Elsy, they are important to me as well! But don't we have our own lives? Why do you look so dull, dear? Our wedding is coming up in less than two months. Why aren't you thinking about that? Hey, their divorce is happening in two weeks. Why don't you understand that? How can you be certain that they won't die in the next two weeks? Oh, shucks! Elsy, I didn't mean that... Hey Elsy! Hey, I'm sorry! I didn't mean that! Hey, please! I'm sorry! I lied to you on that day. You are my first love! I have not just two, but four parents. Honestly, I decided to get married... to experience what it is like to be in love. Susheel, I have to rethink. Hey, I'm sor... Elsy! Shucks! I was thinking about Ichappan and Ichamma, Aunty. What happened to them? - They are having a bitter fight, Aunty. - What? They are fighting again? They had stopped fighting after Lil' one left. I don't know what to say. They are saying that they want a divorce! Who, Aunty? Lil' one. Once she left, they never fought. Lil' one? - You mean... - Hey, what are you doing here? Go and check the load over there! Go! They are loading it right now. Go on! - Go on! - Okay. Hey, you can find so many other girls. But you got mesmerized by her beauty! Look here! Mercy. She is a nurse in America. - Hey! - Where is he going? [Johnnymon Rubbers] Aunty said something today. And it wasn't like one of her absent-minded ramblings. I feel, there's something more to it! Hey, whom does Aunty call "Lil' one"? Lil' one? What all are you saying? Do you know where our old photo albums are? If this is Elsammachi, who is this? Who is this? Who is this, Rosammachi? She is my Lil' one. Who is this, Rosammachi? You needn't know that! He is old enough to know that, Grandma! Yes. We were told about this person when we were his age, right? Tell me. Who is this? She is our elder sister. She left home long back. She is a writer based in America now. Clara Chechi? I am Elsy. Elsamma's daughter. Hey! She agreed to come. My dear daughter! My dear daughter! It's not from a plastic cover. It's our own cow's milk. I made this dumpling. Try this, Clara Chechi. Well, it doesn't look like a dumpling! Don't worry. It doesn't taste like one either! How is your writing going? - It's going well. - Where are you in America? In New York. - I don't want it. - I stay outside the city. What do you guys do? - Angelo and I run a boutique shop in town. - Oh! We have two buses. Oh, nice! It's good that you came, Clara Chechi. 'Chechi', it seems! Don't expect me to address someone who abandoned us 50 years ago as 'Chechi'. - What are you saying? - Let go of me, Mom! 'Chechi', it seems! You must have come here after learning about everything, right? The final hearing is happening tomorrow. [chanting prayers] Isn't anyone here? Isn't anyone here? - Ittoop, we've reached your house. - Don't fall. Kochuthresiamma! Hey, go and put the kids to sleep. Come out. Sister, he will either die lying drunk on the streets, or by getting attacked by loan sharks! Get lost! What the heck! What will happen? Get lost! Careful! Careful, Ittoop! Slowly! Get away from me! - Let's go. Ichamma was lying when she said that... she made a mistake when our brother Johnny died. It was eight years after Johnny's death, when this happened. Go, give this to your dad. Okay. Ichappa... Ichappa... I have earned the top rank in my exams. What? Why didn't you tell us? - Show it! My dear daughter! - This is the result of your efforts! - Smart girl! - It's all God's blessings, dear! My lil' one has become a big shot now! You should look after our family now! True! You and your rank! Oh no! As if she's going to study and take care of us! Nonsense! Ichappan had this bias against us girls, from the beginning. Hey! This is my gift for you. Our elder sister accidentally used Ichappan's towel to bathe, on the day she got her first period. The next day, Ichappan gave each of us towels with our names sewn on them, because of what happened. Hey Alamma, you hit the jackpot! There's one for you as well! If Ichappan hadn't burned my certificate that day, Ichamma might never have met Master. Who did this? Well, I dropped it into the fire by mistake, Master. Mom is lying, Sir. - It was Dad. - Hey! Your daughter has told me that her father is often found lying drunk on the streets. It's been 8 years since your son died, right? Hasn't his anger subsided yet? Come, dear. Let's go and ask him! Master! If you really want to help her, please issue a new certificate for her, and send her to study at a college far away from here. We don't need anything else. Come, dear. I have a friend in Calcutta. Jacob. When I checked, getting her an admission there won't be a problem. So, he has asked us to apply to the Calcutta University. Though it took two months, things started moving forward because of Master. But, in the meanwhile... Okay then. - Okay, Sir. - Okay. Thanks to God's grace, her admission has been approved. Even when I promised you that I will get it done, I didn't expect it to happen so easily. I never realized what was going on between them. But I was sure of one thing. - Do flowers fly from the vines? - No. So what flies from it? - Butterfly! - Yes! Butterfly! When you got late, I thought you must have slept off. Ever since brother Johnny's death, that was the first time I saw Ichamma smiling. - Okay then. - Okay. âª Like the petals that bloom softly âª So, what was in the vines? - Butterfly! - Butterfly! A few days before I left for Calcutta, was the last time I saw Master. Master came to see you. You sit. I will bring tea. I came here to give you something. Calcutta University. B.A., Literature. Don't forget us when you become a big shot. Okay? What I have to say remains the same. The decision is yours, Thresia. After that, Ichamma never spoke to Master. Instead, she took Ichappan for a spiritual retreat and made him quit alcohol. She revamped the factory along with my elder sister, and paid off Ichappan's debts. Have you come here after so long, to defend your mother? Should she have done what she did while she had a husband? But her husband was never there for her, Ichappa. Oh! I haven't come here to defend Ichamma. When you lost your son, you forgot that you had four daughters! I will never say that Ichamma should live... with someone who doesn't look after his children and family! Enough, dear! After returning from the retreat, Ichoy took very good care of her! Ichoy wrote so many letters to you, to apologize for his actions! Did you reply to any of them? Why do you want this divorce, Ichappa? Can't you just stop this? Ichamma, when you go to the court tomorrow, you should say that you don't want to pursue this divorce. Considering your age, the court won't allow anything... without the consent of both parties. Are you able to understand what we're saying, Ichamma? Aren't you going to bed, Ichamma? Ichamma! Dear, please write this for me. Please write down what I'm about to say. To the Honorable Judge... I know what you are going to do, Ichamma! The court will dismiss the case tomorrow. We don't need this. I won't allow this! I asked you to write it! I told you, I won't! Even after all this, you want to make Ichappan's wish happen? Go to bed, Ichamma. You have to wake up early tomorrow, right? I have made up my mind, dear. I've held onto this for almost 50 years. I am not fulfilling Ichoy's wish. Consider that I am taking a burden off my chest. If you love at least me a little bit, please write this for me, dear. Ichamma! I am unable to do it. That's why. Ichamma! To the Honorable Judge, I've heard that we learn more about life as we get older. I don't know how much of that is true. But I'm sure of one thing. We don't make decisions, one after another; but rather make them based on one another. It's possible that the decisions we make, thinking they are wrong, may actually turn out to be right. And decisions we make, thinking they are right... may turn out to be wrong. Without realizing this, we've built a cage of right and wrong decisions that we continue to live in. But... the worst mistake we can make is refusing to apologize even when we are aware of our mistake. I am convinced that I have made a mistake that is beyond forgiveness. And hiding it from my husband and family for so long, was an even bigger mistake. There is no forgiveness for this mistake in the court of God. I don't deserve forgiveness even in the court of mortals. Keeping aside laws and legal bindings, I humbly request the honorable court... to consider this as my husband's and my final wish, and grant us this divorce. Yours faithfully, Mayathattakathu Kochuthresiamma. Careful, Ichappa. Come. Chapter 4: Spring Keep it over there. - Claramma. - Yes. Is all this required? It's his birthday, right? How long do we stay gloomy? Hey, fix some balloons over there as well. âª New leaves sprout on the old trees around âª âª This house awakens to a new season, abound âª âª As smiling sunrays caress the window sills âª âª Let's wear a smile, as soft as silk âª âª Let our spirits entwine, in sweet unison âª I remember Ichamma taking Ichappan for the retreat. Once he came back, he started pampering her. By then, I had crossed the age for pampering! I wasn't angry because you left. It's because I couldn't come along with you! Didn't you feel like coming back even once? When I reached Calcutta, it felt like a new world had opened up before me. After that, I met John, and then I got a chance to go to America. It was my mistake. Sorry! âª As smiling sunrays âª I am sorry! âª Caress the window sills âª - Yaay! - Come, Mathayi! Your friends are here. Don't you want to cut the cake? Where is Ichappan? We will go and meet Ichappan later. Okay? Don't just stand there, Mathayi. Tell us your birthday wish! Jesus, please end the fight between Ichappan and Ichamma! Happy birthday to you! The dim wagon track went no further than the prairie, Susheel... Hey, after meeting Claramma, I feel like exploring the world! I feel like continuing my studies. We can do that together... I know! I can do all that even if I am with you. But... But before I do it with someone else, I want to do all this on my own! That doesn't mean... that I don't love you. I am head over heels in love with you. Hey! I was also lying that day! You've seen my Dad and Mom, right? It was because of their constant emotional blackmail... that I even agreed to post my photo on a matrimonial website! Well, all that changed when I saw you. Let's wait for some time. You go to America or Europe or wherever you want, and come back. In that case, what if I go to Canada and fall in love with a foreigner? Are you saying that I won't find any other girl? You won't find a girl like me! Maybe not, but... We will convince our families in due course. Okay. Shall we go, have some pork curry? Okay. âª O heart of mine, journey along with me âª âª Day has come, darkness has fled free âª After a long time, I saw smiles on everyone's faces. I'm happy! Go to sleep, Ichamma. - Okay. - Good night! âª Come, come âª âª Come, come âª [alarm ringing] - Ichappa! - Yes. We have to go to our family home. Didn't I tell you that I'm never going back there? What is it now? You do this. Apply this on my back. Do it. Apply it, dear. Apply it properly, dear. Do it properly. Let's go to our family home, Ichappa. What is it, dear? We must go to our family home. My dear! [indistinct chatter] Don't you remember our father's final days? Good that it didn't come to that! I was worried she might end up bedridden like that. In a way, it's good that the Lord called her soon! Shall we give this photo on the newspaper? Yes, this photo is fine. I will keep it ready. There's no one here, even to cry for her. They have all lost... an elderly person. But we have lost our daughter. Don't take it to your heart. [chanting funeral prayers] [Johnnymon Ittoop, Aalamma Ittoop] Well, shall we... Yes, let's go. The kids have school tomorrow, right? Let's go. Come. Let's leave. Ichappa, shall we go home? What? Okay. Shall I stay here tonight? Why not, Ichappa? Isn't this your house? I will prepare your room. I will come. Clara Chechi. Hey, come! Dear, if Ichoy is okay with it, please prepare our room itself! If you are okay with it, Ichamma has asked us to prepare her room itself! That's fine. Hey, let them have some privacy. Come! Let's go. The other day, if I had attended Mathayi's birthday, I could have seen our daughter, one last time. When we lost Johnnymon, I thought only about myself. Apologizing can be quite difficult for people who aren't used to it. Mother Mary! âª These fleeting moments, like windows to the past âª âª Offer glimpses of unforgettable memories that forever last âª âª Long have we awakened to the same dawn âª [alarm ringing] âª Long have we awakened to the same dawn âª Kochu! Hey, Kochu! You're sleeping like a log! Kochu! Kochu! Oh no! I am not dead yet, Ichoy! âª Long have we awakened to the same dawn âª âª Long have we awakened to the same dawn âª All the events are unfolding exactly as that astrologer foretold! A divorce happened... but it didn't really happen either. And now, a wedding got cancelled! In that case, there's only one thing that's left to happen. Dad! - Elsy! - Wow! Xavicha! Ichamma, go and give it to Ichappan! Please go and give it to him! Okay! Ichappan will like it! Thanks to the Goddess! Dad! âª O day, take varied paths to roam âª - KOMA! - Yeah! Congrats! âª Long have we awakened to the same dawn âª âª The same dawn âª âª The same dawn âª Look! Our Venuchan made these. Try it! - He will be very happy. - Keep it there. - You stand over there. - What? Stand there. What is it, Ichoy? Hold me. 80 years back, when I married you, no one asked for your consent. Your father asked you to do it, and you agreed. And then... And then... 6 months ago, even when I felt that I should end this marriage, I never asked for your consent. Yet, you agreed. But... I am asking you today. Hold me. - Hold me. - Ichoy! What are you doing? I'm not sure about how much time we have left. But for whatever little time we may have left, do you agree to be my wife? What all are you saying, man? Do you agree? Of course! Then turn your hand around. Show me your finger. âª These unknown days, a joyous refrain, Why give them a name in vain? âª âª Long have we awakened to the same dawn âª Help me get up. Help me up. Hold me! Oh Jesus! This man! My back is hurting! You are crazy to do all this nonsense! Youngsters these days are like this! We saw it during our Elsymol's engagement, right? They go down on their knees and ask for consent before getting married. Do you know that? We have to grow along with the times, right? Oh! You want to grow after you've crossed 90? Oh God! My back is hurting!
