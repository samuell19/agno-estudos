DISTRIBUTOR Mitchell Brothers Grafenberg Spot (1985) ptu73 SE Whisper When I think back in these past months, it seems I've come such a long way. I've learned so much about myself, and it's wonderful to last be free of guilt and suffering. I know it may seem silly I ever felt those things in the first place, especially since I've always considered myself a liberated woman. I'm 22 years old, a graduate of Vassar with a degree in comparative literature. I turned down a scholarship for postgraduate study in France and instead traveled around the world. The Bahamas, the Pacific, the Caribbean, sailing on people's boats mostly. I've always loved the water and being near it, and I've always made friends easily. You wouldn't think that I ever suffered from a sexual dysfunction. At least that's what I thought it was. When I first met Michael, I was afraid that things would go wrong again as they had in the past with other lovers. In fact, it almost turned out that way. I remember that day so well. >> Hot. Time for a swim? Yeah, let's go in the water. Let's fool around in the water. Harry Reems ··· Michael I knew when I first met Leslie, she was something special. And it blew my mind that she went for me the way she did. Yeah, chemistry I guess. But man, what a cute little fox and what a dynamite body. She's got the tightest little winky I've ever seen. Imagine a guy like me with a package like her. I know she's been around. Hey, we both have. But when we get it on, it's so unreal. >> Oh, baby. >> Boy, I love looking at her. She's got the kind of legs a sex maniac would turn out on a lathe. >> Think we can fool around in here? >> And what a winky. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> That's hot. Ginger Lynn ··· Leslie >> So good. >> Yeah. >> What are you doing? So sexy. Look at you. One second, man. What did you want to do? Ooh, baby. Look how pretty that is. Ooh. Oh, what a life. What a life. Ooh, I want to fuck you. >> You do. >> Yeah. You want to sit down? >> Mm-hm. >> Ooh, look at that little pussy. >> Nice and slow. >> Nice and slow. Oh, God, that's wet. That's wet. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Yeah, that's it. That's it, baby. Stick it in. Ooh, fuck. >> Oh, baby. >> No, no, Michael. >> Stop. No. Michael. >> One more, baby. One more. >> No. >> Michael, I'm sorry. >> I'm sorry, Leslie. I guess I'm just not ready for this. >> I'm sorry, Michael. I tried not to. It's just so when I get really excited, I... >> Well, a lot of people must do this every now and then. It's, uh, that's okay. I guess it, well, must happen with a lot of people every now and then. >> But I knew it wasn't okay. Michael began to withdraw into himself. Couldn't tell whether Michael was angry or maybe just hurt and confused. -We argued. -What is this? You're really going, huh? What is it? Grow up, Michael. Yeah. And finally, we decided not to see each other for a while. But it was awful to think that this was the end, not because of my problem. How many times had I heard guys say, "That's okay," when I knew it really wasn't? And because it had happened again, it looked like another relationship had gone down the tubes. Hi, my name is Leslie. So, a few days after Michael and I broke up, I finally found the courage to seek professional help. When a friend suggested seeing a doctor who specializes in sexual disorders, I decided to take the plunge. I admit at first I was a little nervous. But as soon as I met Dr. Elaine Reynolds, I felt more confident that I had done the right thing. She made me feel completely at ease as she took my personal history. So then what happens, Dr. Reynolds, is I become so completely aroused and wet that I can't control myself. And when I climax, it feels as though I'm urinating at the same time. There's not always a whole lot of it, and if a man's penis is inside of me, he usually can't tell at all. But if -- is it okay if I just use plain language to say this? Oh, please do, yes. Use whatever terminology you feel comfortable with. We have no language taboos here. Thanks. Well, if a man's eating my pussy, I end up peeing in his face. >> I see. Does this happen every time you have an orgasm? >> No, but it happens often enough. The most recent crisis is when Michael, that's the man that I've been seeing lately, said he didn't want to see me anymore. He always told me it was because of my problem. >> Oh, well, I can't understand. I do appreciate your candor. I know how difficult it is to talk about these subjects. Can you tell me a little more about your relationship with Michael? >> Well, we've been seeing each other for about two months now. He's a hunk of a guy, and he's also a really nice man. He's a commercial fisherman, and he does marine salvage work on the side. He has his own boat, and he takes really good care of himself. I know that he's had a lot of girlfriends before me, but he says that I'm special. He says he likes to hear me talk about existentialism in contemporary French literature and then suck his cock. Oh, is there anything you can do to help me, doctor? Please, call me Elaine. We're very informal here. And as to your question, yes, I think that we can help you. As a matter of fact, we have been doing studies here for some time that pertain directly to your case, and we have made some fascinating findings. So you're saying my problem isn't any rare sexual abnormality? No, not at all. Not at all. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even qualify as a sexual dysfunction. And if properly understood, there need be no problem with it at all. Now, I want you to talk with Dr. Randy Williams. He's a research associate here, and he's worked very closely with a number of people who have problems very similar to your own. I'll get it. Hello. Can you give me Dr. Williams, please? Thank you. Hello, Dr. Middleton. Hello, Randy. I have a new client here in my office. Are you free to come in and consult? >> Yes, I'd be happy too. >> Okay, good. Okay, thank you. Talk to you in a minute. Bye-bye. Fine, he's on his way. Now, while we're waiting for Dr. Williams, maybe I should give you a little background information. Okay? >> A significant percentage of women appear to experience some form of ejaculation during orgasm. >> As I listened to Dr. Williams go into more detail, I felt so much more comfortable. He explained that back in the '50s, some sex researchers had not only studied female ejaculation, but that a man named Ernest Graffenberg had found what seemed to be a pleasure point somewhere in the vagina that may be related to the expulsion of fluid. It was called the Graffenberg spot, or the G-spot. Then Dr. Reynolds mentioned that there was another woman client at the clinic that afternoon who was going to be shown how to actually find and experience the G-spot. She asked me if I'd be interested in participating in the procedure. I said sure. Good. Now, before we begin, I want to let you all know that anyone going through the G-spot palpation procedure here at the clinic is bound to be a little nervous at first. This is normal. Okay? We found that playing a little taped music really helps everyone to relax, so we'll be doing that. Now, if everyone's ready,procedure. here we are, then we'll have Randy demonstrate the Thor Southern ··· Randy Ginger Lynn The G-spot is located on the interior wall of the vagina. In many cases, it can be felt by digital palpation, as I am now preparing to demonstrate. It's about half the distance between the cervix and the proximal side of the pubrocoxigous muscle near the bladder neck. When deep digital pressure is applied upward, there is an initial urge to urinate, but this is quickly replaced by a strong pleasurable feeling. In some cases, the G-spot may swell and get harder with continued stimulation, as I am now doing. This stimulation may lead to some form of orgasmic explosion of fluid, which is not always expelled forcefully. Annette Haven ··· Dr. Elaine Reynolds Thank you, Randy. I think that that'll be fine, and I'll take over now. Okay, now, here we go. It's not too cold, I hope. Okay, now. How does that feel? I feel like I can feel it. Now, we'll maintain the rhythm, and then it should take a little while. Amber Lynn ··· Sandy How you doing? Doctor, I'm sorry, I just don't think, nothing's gonna happen for me here. Well, sometimes it takes a little time, nothing to worry about. Just relax, it's fun. Can I try that, dear? Certainly. Why don't you two just switch places, and I'll put on a new glove. I'm sorry. Oh, nothing to apologize for. Sometimes this takes a while. Just sit down here, and you'll be fine. Sit down and relax for a minute and watch. Shall I leave this on? Whatever your preference is, whatever you feel most comfortable doing, it's fine with me. Well, let's take it off. It looks like it's giving you more problems than it is anything else. Okay, here we go. That's good. Very good. Okay, now. This isn't cold. There. Okay. Oh, wow. Well, Leslie, I think that you would make Dr. Graefenberg proud. Thanks. Amazing. Elaine, sorry to interrupt, but there's a telephone call for you on line one. They said it was important. Oh, great. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm going to have to leave. I'll be back as soon as I can. Leslie, I've taken quite an interest in your case, and I have a suggestion to make. Now, as you may know, I do from time to time take a more active role in certain clinical activities. And, well, by this I mean that I personally assume the responsibilities of a sexual surrogate. Now, I know that you haven't been seeing Michael for a while, but I would like to ask your permission to at least interview him with the understanding that I may ask him to come here to the clinic for some counseling and perhaps have to assist him in a manner requiring surrogate therapy. Well, Elaine, as you probably know, I've been seeing a bit of your associate, Randy, and sure, I don't mind. I guess what I want to say is don't fall in love. No, no, I certainly won't do that, and I really do appreciate your trust. Thank you. I'm home, God damn it! God damn motherfucking piece of shit boat! Hey, Michael, Michael, what's going on? This fucking boat is driving me crazy, man! Hey, hey, hey, take a... That's a ransy little pilot! Take a break, take a break, all right? Here. Rick Savage ··· Rocky I'm sorry, Rocky. I'm just a little uptight today, you know? No big deal? Yeah, fuck no. Hey, hey, man, I figure it's a month before the season starts. We're gonna be ready, no shit, no problem. Look, Michael, I don't mean to pry, but it's that girl, ain't it? Yeah, probably so. I've been thinking about it a lot. Rocky, let me ask you something. Sure. Another thing I was telling you about,Leslie, spilling all over me when she came. Yeah. What do you think? You think I'm some kind of old-fashioned guy just because I freak out when I taste piss? Piss? How do you know what it is? You've been drinking piss? Come on, man, you know what I mean. You know, I'm just a regular dude about a lot of things. It just freaks me out, that's all. Ah, forget about it. Hey, look, do you want to take the rest of the day off? Go ahead. Uh, no, I can't. I gotta wait and stick around. Sheil's gonna come by and pick me up around 4. Oh, Sheil. Hey, I'm sorry I blew my top. Nah, nah. Uh, is anybody home? Ah, hi, what can I do for you? Well, are you Michael? Captain Michael himself. Well, I'm Elaine Reynolds. Dr. Elaine Reynolds? That's right, dear. I have something I'd like to talk to you about. A lot of work. -Come on, bring your own stuff down here. -Okay. There you go. Uh, hi. Uh, I got some work to do topside. You have tennis? Okay, Rocky. What's up, Doc? Well This`s Dr. Reynolds told me she was some kind of a sex researcher, and that my name had come up during an interview which she had with, of all people, Leslie. Well, I guess I should explain. Before I could get upset about it, she told me that Leslie had nothing to do with her coming here, only that patient confidentiality hadn't been broken, that Leslie had given approval for her to look me up. Then she started talking about women and orgasm, and how there really was some kind of fluid they expelled when really aroused. Apparently it was new research data that was just beginning to show up. And she said it may have a connection with an area in women's pussies that people were just now getting hip to. That's what I thought. That was the impression I had. Boy, I couldn't believe it. It was this doctor lady, and I could see that underneath that dress she was a stone fox, and here she was going on about the most intimate things. She suggested maybe I'd like to see her at the clinic. Well, when I said no to that, she gave me a ticket to a place called Club Edwina. Said it was an exclusive private sex club where she did a little moonlighting as a consultant. I could check things out for myself. I said I'd think about it. Thank you. Oh, there. Okay, now I can show you something of what I was talking about. Well, here. Put this on. What for? Well, it's not going to take long. Just trust me. You're a little funny. Yeah, gloves affect people that way sometimes. Okay. Okay.This is a very simple technique that I'm going to show you here, and there's really nothing to be intimidated about at all. Okay. Move it around. Now, what I want you to do is open your fingers now. Okay, now just insert them gently. There we go. Feel up on the vagina wall about two inches up. -You feel it? -Yeah. Okay, now I want you to palpitate that very firmly, like a motion, kind of like that. Firm. A firm motion. Regular. Yeah, like that. That's how you stimulate somebody's G-spot. Want me to stop? No, no, no, no, no. Don't stop. Then never stop once you start with a lady. Okay, that's good. That's very good. Now see, this will give me an orgasm in a while, in any short time here, yes. Vigorously. But a rhythmic motion, not vibratory. Use those fingers to palpitate. Up inside. -The whole hand, no. Just the fingers. -That's all I'm doing. Yes.There, there, there, there. Now you've got it. Oh, yes. I think you've got it. -It's kind of weird, I've got to admit. -Oh Oh, but it gives a rest. How good it feels. -Feel it? -Yeah. I feel it. I feel it getting bigger. Yeah, there is a flow of blood to the genitals while you're doing it. Oh, man. That's the same thing. So you see what I mean? Yeah, sure do, doc. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh... That was a professional demonstration that I think was needed. I don't think that doing anything more at this point would be professional. Geez, doc. Whatever you say. That's the way it is. Just that's the same thing as Leslie. I know, I know. It's amazing, isn't it? A lot of women have this? A percentage. A percentage. A significant enough percentage for it to be notable to sociologists absolutely, and sexologists. Huh. It's just like lubrication fluid. Maybe, uh, maybe I'm, uh, maybe I've just been a jerk about all this. No, no, no, no, no, not at all. I don't think that's true. I just don't think that you knew about it. Most people don't. There's nothing sure to get bad at all. Traci Lords ··· Traci Rick Savage ··· Rocky ptu73 SE Whisper My death loves you. Oh God. -Well, doc. -Thank you. Thank you. Nice and easy, baby. Oh God. Oh, Rocky, your wife is amazing. You any thing her? Coming... Oh...Very good Quickly fuck me Ah...I love you ptu73 SE Whisper Fuck... Yeer,rocky,god.... Oh...good.... Thor Southern ··· Randy Randy and I continued to see each other. He was a really sweet guy, Very caring and affectionate. And I knew that I needed that. Someone to take my mind off of Michael. He was no use denying it. I missed him. I missed his touch. I missed his cock. I asked Dr. Reynolds if she had seen him. She said that she had, but she hoped I understood that it wasn't ethical for her to say much more. I knew it wasn't right for me to ask her to intercede for me. And I admired her for that. I remember this one day when Randy took me to this workshop to see a guy about welding something. I've always gone for guys that do things with their hands. Like fishermen and carpenters working construction. Sometimes it was strange. I'd find myself spacing out. Sometimes thinking about making it with Michael. As I sat there waiting, I watched this real hunk of a guy wearing this leather thing and wearing a mask. The light from the welding and the sparks. Looking at him got me so hot and I felt it away into the most wonderful fantasy. Ginger Lynn ··· Leslie John Holmes I Guess I was curious more than anything. I've never heard of this place man. It sure was plush. What a setup. Dr. Reynolds said it was a private club exclusive. Where members could relax and if they wanted act out a few fantasy or just watch? It sure was plenty to look at. Oh, yeah Oh Oh, yeah such it Oh, yeah Nina Hartley Rita Erotica Oh, my pussy. Good yeah more... more... Oh, bad girl. Oh, yeah, Oh, fine. Hello. Is your name Michael? Yes it is. Someone looking for me? Well, in a way maybe. Actually, Dr. Reynolds told me I might see you here. My name is Sasha. Sasha. Sasha? That's a lovely name. Thank you. Elaine told me you've been doing some research on G-spot phobia. Have you suffered from that condition? Well, maybe. But I think I'm getting over it quickly. And do you know where to find and touch a woman's G-spot? Yeah. Beautiful big Messiah. Oh, I feel so good. Don't make me come here. Oh, that feels good. Oh, yes. Oh, don't do it. Oh, Sasha. Yeah. Oh, God. Really? Oh, Michael. Oh, Michael, your dick feels good. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Funny how things work out. Elaine invited me to a party on a friend's houseboat. It was just a small affair, she said. A few nice folks she said I'd like to meet. It wasn't a date exactly. Just show up, bring a bottle of wine. Something in her voice, a kind of insistent tone, I guess, urged me to be there. So, I said sure. Funny, I wasn't thinking so much of seeing Elaine again. I guess I wanted to pin her down and ask her about Leslie. Oh God, I miss that girl. Hi everybody. Oh, hey. Rocky, hi. How you been? Leslie, hello. -Good of you to come, -Thank you. Here, let me introduce you to one of the occupants of our floating pleasure palace. Leslie, this is Sandy. Oh Leslie, it's nice to see you again. Hi Sandy. I'm sure that you two have seen each other at the Institute. Come on in. What are you doing here? I don't think I like anything I can in a place like this. Hey everybody, sorry I'm late. Michael. Leslie. How old are you today? I missed you. He undoubtedly is. Would you like a drink? I'd love one. Did you know I was going to be here? No, did you know I was going to be here? No, I didn't. Here's to being here. To us. To us. Well, so how are you two doing? Hey doc, was this a set up or what? Oh, nothing of the kind Michael. I mean, what do you think we are, cupids? We just thought that two clients who had conquered their dreaded G-spot phobia might have something in common to share. Oh no. Let's go take a walk. Okay. Who would ever believe things could have turned out this way? And here I almost didn't show up to that party. Leslie and I could hardly stop talking. We had so much to say to each other. Dr. Reynolds and her associate Randy were of course guilty as charged with bringing us back together. And thank God for that. I understand what the problem is. Well, it's nice to know that there's still such a thing as happy endings. You know I've been a jerk. Whether you want to see me again or not, I just want to tell you I'm sorry. It was so unbelievable how it all turned out. And I knew now that any fears that Michael and I had ever had about juices of any kind were now a thing of the past. We had each explored something new about our own sexuality and with the help of some very special people, we've been brought back together. There's even a big bonus. A beautiful little thing called the Graffenberg Spot. In some cases the G-Spot may swell and get harder with continued stimulation as I am now doing. This is stimulus... [Laughter]
