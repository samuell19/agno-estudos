THE THIRD REICH, 15 MARCH, 1945 Put it in the middle. By what right did you start without me? Gauleiter Koch has ordered me to be here from beginning to end. To the very end? Halt! It's nothing serious, it's just a small piece. It's better if you leave now. I'll take it for Gauleiter Koch. Manfred... HANS KLOSS MORE THAN DEATH AT THE STAKE Stanislaw Mikulski Tomasz Kot Emil Karewicz Piotr Adamczyk Jerzy Bonczak, Janusz Chabior Piotr Garlicki, Piotr Glowacki A funeral ceremony in connection with the death of one... of Adolf Hitler's closest associates, Ssman Otto Skorzenny will be held at noon in Almundena cemetery in Madrid Skorzenny became famous for executing many spectacular actions with German commando... Many of his friends from the ll World War will probably come to the ceremony Heil Hitler, Oberfuhrer. - Heil... Mischke. What's up? Our comrades are asking if Oberfuhrer would say a few words at the funeral. Tell them that I'll be honored to. Did you know Otto Skorzenny well? We liberated Mussolini together. Nobody has expected you here, you're listed as one of the wanted nazis. Mischke, we're in fascist general Franco's Spain... Besides, I'm on the hundredth position, even Brunner was higher. I've heard he's dead. Really? Is that what you've heard? What was the cause of his death? - Jewish lead? Look who's here. Obersturmbannfuhrer... Otto Skorzenny, was called the most dangerous man in Europe. But only to Reich's enemies. For us, he will always be the bravest soldier in Europe. Obersturmbannfuhrer Skorzenny's direct superior, who personally gave orders to him, was our great leader, Adolf Hitler. - Heeeeeil! Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles... Fascists from the whole world have come to the funeral. In spite of predictions, generalissimo Franco, who is currently in hospital, has not been present at the ceremony And now for other news... Yes? Would mind if I took a minute of your time? Not at all. - Your face seems familiar. Lieutenant Hans Kloss. - I'm Oberfuhrer Gunter Werner, and this is Johann Mischke, he was a Hitler jugend during the war and defended Berlin. Mischke, please, you can go and lead the guests. Yes sir, Oberfuhrer. What are your plans for today lieutenant? I came to contact comrades from Abwehr... Graves have ears. We are going to have a glass of wine as a farewell to Otto, in my villa near Madrid. There we can calmly talk... about everything. Would be so kind and introduce yourself once more? Let me out at once! I don't know what you're after, but you won't find out anything this way. I served the SS till I got the rank of Oberfuhrer. Please treat me seriously.. First name and surname? - Hans Kloss. When and where was the last time you saw Erich Koch? I saw Gauleiter Koch only once in 1933, during a military parade in Munich, right next to the Fuhrer. Yet another lie. I know that the whole time during the war... you've been a Polish spy code name J23, who was impersonating Kloss. And, in 1945, you have been exposed as a Polish spy, by an SD officer, Hermann Brunner. Nonsense! You have to have evidence for this kind of accusations. Unfortunately for you, our mutual acquaintance came from Argentina to Skorzenny's funeral... and recognised you on the telly.. Hello Hans, dear friend. Still alive? Unlike you I couldn't attend the funeral. Since Mossad kidnapped Eichman, I can't feel safe even at hospitable general Franco's country But I put the uniform on as well, to honor Otto's memory When was the last time we saw each other? I think it was 1945, right? Oberfuhrer, I don't know this man. You're making me sad, Hans. Do you really not remember Hermann Brunner? I could remind you, but Oberfuhrer doesn't like my ways, you Polish snooper. I am a German officer and if my hands weren't tied... Bravo, Hans, you haven't changed a bit... Maybe they believed your little tale. But not me! I remember everything. Koenigsberg, 1945... Your soviet friends close the ring of the envelopment. March 12th. Remember now...? KOENIGSBERG, 12 MARCH, 1945 Sturmmbahnfuhrer Brunner! Sturmmbahnfuhrer Hermann Brunner with his troops. Take us to Koenigsberg. Obersturmbahnfuhrer Ringle. We are not going to Koenigsberg, but to Koenigsberg Ost train station... There's no use then. The track is broken. There is no escape from Koenigsberg. Do you understand? We're surrounded. So? - It's a special transport. So Sturmmbahnfuhrer must manage on his own. I'm an SS officer, just like you. Get inside then. Two men to the back of the lorry. Throw it out! Comrades, every day the Russian army forces, are moving faster through the German enemy line. According to the latest reports, our land, offensive has yet again crushed the enemy I said I won't come down to the shelter. Our brave men have just surrounded Koeningsberg. It's another success... I said don't interrupt... Kloss... Am I disturbing...Hans? What are you doing here during the raid? I thought you wouldn't refuse to shelter a defenseless woman... The shelter is in the basement. Go downstairs, take the second right from the entrance. And what if I'm too scared to be alone? And I only feel safe next to you... Anyway they're leaving. Come inside... A glass of Cognac perhaps? - Do you have French cognac? Ringle always does. Ringle evacuated yesterday My Georgian Cognac will have to suffice. Ringle has just returned. He couldn't get out of the city.. Not too provocative? - Perfect... for bombing. I like you Hans, but you're not taking me seriously How do you intend to evacuate? Fuhrer's order is clear! Koenigsberg was declared a stronghold, and we're going to defend it until final victory... ...or the last man standing. You know, Ringle doesn't want to be the last soldier. And you, Hans? - Ingrid, you're getting dangerously close, to being accused of treason. I just want to get out of this hell. No one can blame me for that... In a week or two, the Russians will be here. You know what is going to happen to German women... And I want to live Hans! I want to live, dammit. I'm not going to pay for this Nazi... Ingrid? - Come in Elsa, don't be afraid of me. See you in the castle. Elsie... Do you have to humiliate me like this? Do you know how this... is going to gossip about me? Everybody will think I'm your mistress! So... Ringle has returned to the castle. On his way he came across some SS soldiers under command of an SD officer. The boxes were taken back to the basement. The guards are keeping watch, like before. Ringle is the only one who has the access. - What's inside the boxes? I don't know. Maybe paintings from the castle? Please give me back my "papers" so I can go. To all Germans! The governmentâ€™s insane policy will lead this nation to it's end... Every true German should demand for the warfare to be stopped immediately, and to begin peace talks with the Soviets. Do you really think that the members of the party aren't true Germans? Who are they then? Some Tyrolese Swisses? I wasn't the one who wrote that. - Who then? Doctor Krause? No. My father has nothing to do with it! Father is an honest national socialist... I guess it's better to say.. I wrote it alone. Miss Elsa, do you know what is going to happen to you and your father if these leaflets get to Gestapo? - Perhaps... if you were a sneak... Let's say I won't consider these leaflets as treason, but an irresponsible child's play I could do that, but you don't give me any reasons to. I understand... You don't understand anything. Who packed the boxes? Ringle and my father. Father doesn't tell me, anything about top secret, business matters... Elsa, you're going to find out what is really in those boxes. Then, I'm going to destroy the leaflets and forget about them. And you don't want me to... No. I understand. You like Ingrid. I'll find out. Tomorrow. CITY KOENIGSBERG, STAFF DEFENCE, 1945 Hans! - Brunner. I thought you're smoking cigars on Alexanderplatz, in Berlin. Oh, haven't you heard about the Soviets? They've surrounded us. You must have heard. I've heard about the officer who stopped Ringle from leaving. I saved him the trip. So what are you doing here? Hans, old friend? Yesterday on March 12th, the Russians managed to close the blockade around Koenigsberg. There are two ways of evacuation. The first one - despite Soviets' considerable advantage by air, from the airport, which is still in our control, or by lorries to Pilau harbour. Unfortunately we're observing intensified guerrilla warfare on Koenigsberg - Pilau route. What do you think you're doing? You're only seventeen. What about evacuation via railway? We made such attempt yesterday Perhaps we should repeat it? Ladies and gentlemen, Sturmbannfuhrer Hermann Brunner who is present here at my invitation, has led a far advanced patrol along the railway track at night. I asked not to be disturbed! Gauleiter of East Prussia, Erich Koch! Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! General, Obersturmbannfuhrer... gentlemen. We are to do everything to make sure the transport marked "Koenigstein" doesn't end up in Russians' hands. The transport has got to safely get to Berlin today Mister Ringle will be held responsible directly before me. The Minister of the Office of the Reich, Martin Bormann has assigned Standartenfuhrer Lau to be his liaison officer. Standartenfuhrer Lau will have the last word in all questionable matters. If you need my personal help, please send captain Kloss, he's the only officer outside of SS that has some gumption... I have to defend the city.. "Koenigstein" transport... is as important as defending the city Understood? Fuhrer himself... I'm the one deputizing for Fuhrer here! Do you understand that Mr. Hauser? Yes sir, Mr. Gauleiter! I expect that in no more than 3 days, Standartenfuhrer Lau, will inform me that the transport is safe in Berlin. Get down to work! "Koenigstein" transport, is a priority task. Hauser is to defend the castle, as long as the transport is here. It's the transport that is most important, not the castle! Don't move! Hands up! - Rudy.. It's me. Janek. - How's the raid? The bomb was dropped a hundred meters away. That's good. Bombs rarely fall twice at the same spot. Are you taking the medication? - But it's going to end soon. The Russians will be here in a few days. Before they come, you have to contact Bartosz once again. Germans are preparing to evacuate a very valuable transport, code name "Koenigstein". Three trucks... and several SS troops in the guard. Transport is to be stopped, and the delivery to be taken over and secured. What's in it? - Twenty five big, heavy boxes. I'm trying to find out. For now, tell Bartosz to get the unit ready and to wait with the guys. There's a possibility that if they decide to evacuate by a plane, the airport will have to be hit. They're not going to make it then. After the last operations, Bartosz has less than hundred guys. In that case we'll have to contact the Soviets and ask them for help. But that's only as the last resort, when I'm sure which route Krause chooses to evacuate the boxes. You know all this from his daughter? Nazi father, and an antifascist daughter? I don't buy it. Be careful. I've been careful for the last four years already Rudy. I will come back in the afternoon. Don't shoot me. Watch out... What's the matter? Brunner has returned... He's not at all interested in the transport. Perhaps he's focused on himself. He doesn't care about anything else. Perhaps... or maybe he already knows the rest? What if she lied? - No one has ever lied to me in the entire war, Kurt. Let's go! - Maybe we should burn the body? It would stink, or someone might notice the smoke. No one will find her here. The fifty million dollars... How do we split it? We need to get it first! And, what's much harder, we need to drive it out through the front, to the Reich... But I'll take care of that. We're surrounded. Completely. This remark doesn't bring anything new to the situation. These are the facts, Standartenfuhrer. Kloss. You're from the intelligence. Use your head. There is a way out. Again, escaping by air is unacceptable. Dr Krause, we are going to board that plane too, and I'm willing to take the risk. The stake in this game is bigger than death, Obersturmbannfuhrer. I'm not talking about the plane. Here. Sir, you're pointing at the sea. - At the bay. And the bay is frozen. The ice may be thin. The Russians have supplied Leningrad by ice for three years. This could work. Bravo Kloss. So it can be done, can't it? I can personally be in charge of the transport. No. The transport will be led by a man from SD. What's his name? Brunner. Rudolf! Rudy! What are you doing here? A bomb has hit the ruins, and a lot of people were hiding here. We were helping in evacuating the wounded. Where were they taken? Navy's hospital, because the one at Wagnerstrasse has been destroyed. What's his condition, doctor? No hope for him, captain. But it's some Pole. Rudolf... I don't know anything. Rudy.. It's me, Janek. Janek... Get me out of here... Please... Where's the radio, Rudi? Destroyed... Bartosz is waiting for the attack orders, but I can't... I know. How do I let them know, Rudolf? Morphine. Get me morphine. Please, focus. How do I contact Bartosz's unit? On your own... What did you say? You're on your own... Make way! Move it! Lay her here for now... What's with her? Covered in the rubble. Ingrid. What happened? Brunner... Brunner? Brunner... wants to take over the transport... What's inside? Treasure... What are you talking about? What treasure? Prussia's and Third Reich's biggest treasure, The Amber Room... Talk to me Hans... Calm down. It's going to be OK. I've always liked you... I like you too, Ingrid. Halt! That's not him! What are you doing here, Miss? What do you... think you are doing, sir? Did Ringle take the transport away? No. Where is it then? Brunner took it. How? Under Ringle's nose? Not from under Ringle's nose but by his order. Did something happen? Don't you get it? Brunner wants to take over the transport. He wants to steal it! I'll tell my father... No. Wait... Your father didn't go with him? No. He may have pneumonia. For now, don't say anything to anyone. What do you want to do? Stop Brunner. Alone? Why don't you ask Ringle, Hauser, my father, or someone else from Hitler, to help you out? I don't know who's on my side. What about me? You Miss? You have to. If Brunner is a traitor and has five hitmen with him, then, well, not that I care, but they're going to kill you. As your father said, this time the stake is bigger than my death. Thank you. And? He's just taken off. As you can see, I can't die... ...and I know about everything... About what you talked about with Ingrid in your quarters. I know that Krause's daughter was in love with you, foolish girl... Come on, don't be so surprised. I worked in world's best intelligence... Oberfuhrer, I don't know Elsa Krause... nor him... Really.. because of... our long-term acquaintance, I wanted to do this softy But you're not making it easy Mischke! You're making a bloody mistake! Hans... You know well that nobody can take this. Maybe an hour, maybe two... but not three... When was the last time that you saw gauleiter Koch? My name is Hans Kloss. My department store in Hamburg is going bankrupt. The bank refuses to lend me some money I came here to get a loan. Are you sure Sturmbannfuhrer? He might not survive heavy interrogation. Son... I haven't even started heavy interrogation yet. It's a pity you weren't with us, on Szuch Street, you could learn a lot... Do it. I'll break him. He's not superman. Nobody is... Well, obviously nobody but us from SS. I have waited thirty years for this moment. I'm going to break him, no matter how tough he is. I had a colleague, Schtetcke. He has J23's dossier from wartime. If I remember well, there are his writing samples... He could send them over... But before they come, do you have a moment? You're not my only guest from South America... Close the door. Reichsminister, may I introduce to you Sturmbannfuhrer Hermann Brunner. Mr. Sturmbannfuhrer, Riechsminister Martin Bormann. Prosit! They made you an excellent face, Reichsminister. I must admit that two years ago, during underground works, when your, excuse me, skull was found, Reichsminister, many doubted if you're alive. In fact, what they've found was my driver's Erik's skull. To revive the Reich we need funds. The masterpiece created by Danish craftsmen, the Amber Room a piece of which you stole some time ago, is the priceless German cultural heritage. The Amber Room, which both we and you've been looking for, is worth to an art collector some three hundred and fifty million dollars. Brunner, the Fourth Reich needs that money I understand, that you're the chancellor of new Fourth Reich. Oberfuhrer Werner is your deputy what about me? In the pocket of your jacket, you have your famous brown notepad in which you have noted down false names of over three hundred hiding SS nazis. Next to those names, you readily note down all sums of money that those comrades transfer to your account on the Cayman islands. They are giving you around two hundred thousand dollars per year. Nice joke, you've heard gossip from someone and now... Enough! We're only interested in the Amber Room. Besides that piece of amber, have you got anything else? I have the key let's say "document", pointing to where it is hidden, or rather, its half... What half? Who has the other half? This question will be answered by Kloss. Kloss, Kloss! But you're only questioning him about Koch... Because Koch was the one who was in charge of the "Koenigstein" operation. And it was him who decided to secure the Amber Room for better times. And most of what Koch knows, Kloss must know as well. Take it easy Mischke. We'll try some of this. Scopolamine? Doesn't always work. This one is modified. It's from the war. We used to call it the "truth serum". On five hundred tries, not one person has lied. Even Canaris. Name? Hans Kloss. When was the last time that you've seen Erich Koch? In 1933 in Munich, when he was driving by in a parade with Fuhrer... When did you see Elsa Krause? I don't know Elsa Krause. How about me? You're Hermann Brunner. We met today Rubbish, not the truth serum! If you have doubts, we can try it on you. Unbelievably good agent... I'm not surprised he's been fooling you since 1941 , Brunner... Others. I realised it quickly.. There are no tough people, only those that were badly interrogated. He didn't give in to electric current, to scopolamine, isn't that enough? He didn't give in because... Wait a minute! Because? Because he's telling the truth! What do you mean? He's not a spy? No, that's the real Kloss. But that's good for us! Gentlemen, we must learn from the Soviets how to use the advantage. Let's send Kloss to Poland to get the information about where Koch has hidden the Amber Room. Now you just have to apologise to him... it was an honor to have you in my house. I hope that as a soldier, you understand that everything that has happened to you is that Polish spy's J23 fault. He's the one who was impersonating you. You're our hope boy! See you in Fourth Reich! Brunner, don't forget about the amber. Your contact's name is: Edmund Tokarz. Please remember about the cheque. No reason to sulk, there's a war, a cold one, and you have to help us. Do you trust him? I don't even trust myself. But neither of us can go to the prison in Poland. But he can. Prison. Good morning. I'd like to talk to Mr. Edmund Tokarz. Speaking. Do you sell spark plugs for NSU Prinz? Yes... I mean... yes, I'm the one that sells the spark plugs for NSU PRYNC. I'd like to buy four. Let's meet in an hour, in front of MDM. Ministry of Defense. Hallo, this is "Pianist". I have to talk to mayor Czubak. Talk to me. Agent J23. Real name Stanislaw Kolicki. Why did you take of fence? And why did you abandon the army? The army abandoned me and put me in prison in Rawicz with a death penalty That's the punishment for treason. You were accused of being a double agent and of collaborating with the Germans. I know, the sentence was overruled. Luckily before it was executed. Well, yes, luckily because otherwise we wouldn't be able to meet. I'm mayor Czubak, and that's captain Socha... We'd like you to work for us. The motherland is giving you the unique opportunity to rehabilitate. I'm not interested. Why is that, do you not like our socialist motherland? I like the motherland. I just don't like you. We don't fancy older men either. You've worked in the Services and so do we. So let's quit this paper-chase. We're looking for the property stolen by the Nazis. We called you out for this reason. The real Hans Kloss, the one you were impersonating during the war, had it with him. He's alive. We've arrested him this afternoon in the city center. It's a small piece from the Amber Room. Does it ring a bell? Elsie! Elsa. Get inside! What happened? The Russians raided the airport. It's in flames. So many were killed. The Russians will be here any moment now! Nothing will help you here. Get inside. Here... Warm up. Thank you... it's despicable, but thank you. You are still looking for my father's transport. That's why you're helping me. No. Not because of that. I heard that SS man, Lau and my father, talking with someone over the phone. They sent a jet-fighter to bomb something. They themselves were supposed, to get to Pilau. I see. Are you sure about Pilau? What do you mean? They sent two transports through the bay Lau and your father were with the real one are going to Pilau and Brunner, who was transporting bricks, was bombed by Ringle. I don't get it. Why would he bomb Brunner? So that he can say that the transport is lost, at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, and to make sure that no one will be looking for it until the end of the war. Meanwhile, the second one, the real one, safely got to Pilau. I bet right now Ringle and Lau are loading the boxes on a ship. And your father is gullible to help them. What's in Pilau? A secret naval base. Heil Hitler! You're late. Load the boxes! Yes, Sir! Can you hear that? It's the Russians. Not more than two or three kilometers away What do you intend to do? I have to stop them. The Russians? Ringle, Lau and... your father. You've seen my father? Did anything happen to him? No. If you manage to stop them, we'll all get into the Russians' hands. And this mysterious transport of yours as well. Trust me Elsa. Nothing is going to happen to you or your father. I promise. Can you promise? How? I will divert the guards' attention. Get to the harbor. Steal the explosives from the warehouse and blow up the helm of the sub chaser. Wait, wait. How will you divert the guards' attention? I don't know... No. it's too dangerous. Looks like you have... no other choice... Halt Freulein. This is military area. I saw Russian tanks. They'll be here soon. I heard that it's possible to evacuate from Pilau? It's true, but civilians evacuate from the civilian harbour. You will have to go this way around three or four kilometers along the shore. Let the lady inside the guardhouse, so she can warm up. But if you'd like to warm up, miss, we can really let you in. No, thank you. I have to go. What's your name miss? Brigitte... it must be the second one... because the first, if I remember well, is... Elsa... isn't it miss Krause? Is that you, Franke? The last one, Obersturmbahnfuhrer! Halt! Alarm! To action stations! Alarm! Kloss! Get the gun! He's going to kill us! Kloss! She'll die first! Leave her alone! What do you think you're doing, you criminal?! Doctor. Release my daughter. Lau! Release her... I swear to God, I'll tell them everything... They'll hang you... Dad, no... Kloss! Miss Krause will be next. What a day for this family?! Kloss! Marcus! Yes sir! Execute him. And hang the girl. No, no... You're held responsible directly before me for this. Do it... Pleasure... Call Koenigsberg. The defense commander, general Hauser, will explain you everything. Shut up! Do it! Fire! Hans, wake up! Wake up! Can you hear me? Please, Hans! Elsie, we have to... I'm sorry sorry.. Don't be... No? Then I'm not... You don't know how I'd love to kiss you... But it's a bit complicated right now... We have to run. We still have a chance. How far to the nearest airport? But not as big as to discuss geography now... Maybe one of them has the key to remove the handcuffs. Right. Russians. Hurry up, Elsie. Hurry! Ruki wierch, Fryc! Let her go! Hold it... Don't you have eyes! And you, why did they want to shoot you? I'm yours. Take me to your commander. Ours? German traitor! Morozow, shut your mouth when I'm questioning the captive, would you? I've got important information for your commander. What do we have here? It's a Fryc. Germans wanted to shoot him. He says he's ours and wants to speak with the commander. Take him to the intelligence. They'll find out if he's ours. This "ptica"... And her... Bring her over... No, no... Please, I beg you... Comrade! She's an important captive. Take us to the quarters. Hans, don't leave me. Hans! How's that, "comrade"? Is she one of ours, too? Because she sure looks like a German chic to me. Believe me! I must talk to the commander, the commissionaire or the chief of intelligence. Swolocz! I asked, is she German or not? She's German, but... Quiet then. German captives are to be immediately transferred to the camp. We won't get accused of retaliation on native civilians this way Comrade Stalin himself gave this order, fool! We need to get to the quarters! Fools! No, please, no... Hans, no... Please... Elsie! Hans! I'll release you... I promise... I'll free you today! I promise, Elsie! Do you know what happened to your Elsa? I've tried to release her, but I failed. Then I heard she starved to death in a Gulag. Wait... We've got a surprise for you. Hans... We've detained Kloss, pretending we're from the US embassy You've had a lot of luck that it was the USA services that stopped you. If you got into the hands of the Polish, it would be the end for you. As long as we're in the United States' embassy building, you're safe. You must deport me to Germany I want to go back to my normal life. If you decide to fully cooperate, the US government will take care of you. If not, we will leave you to your own fate at the hands of the services of the Eastern Block... No, please, I'll describe everything... Our latest methods of interrogation... Fear works better than beating someone up... Unbelievable, you're still identical... Right. This is the piece of Amber that Kloss got from Brunner. Hermann Brunner... it's a kind of a pass for Erich Koch who is currently in a death cell. We want you to get back into the game... and meet with Koch, impersonating Hans Kloss. Koch has the second piece of Amber. Your piece will prove that you were sent by Werner and Brunner. Well then, how about it, comrade mayor... Will you help us? I won't. Brunner and Werner are on the list of one hundred most wanted nazis in the world. They have been sentenced to death by default judgment, for crimes done to civilians. And you don't care? Through them we can get to Martin Bormann. Can I go now? I'll give you a pass... And about your Elsa, you're wrong. She didn't die in a gulag. Before being freed by the power of amnesty in 1954, she took part in anti-Soviet actions and was sentenced again. She was sentenced to twenty-five years of working in a camp near Jenisej, without the right of correspondence. She might be free in five years. Or maybe not. We have been watching all people involved in the "Koenigstein" transport for years now, along with our soviet comrades. These are Elsa Krause's acts and the current place of her arrest. I'll help you if you and your "comrades" manage to release her on parole, and get her permission to go to West Germany We can discuss it, but you know the rules. Only after you sign and agree to cooperate. What's my guarantee? I promise. As God is my witness. You have got to trust us, as we have to trust you. I don't trust you. But I have no other choice. Major... You're about to become Kloss again... Sergeant... What are the chances that she's still alive and we'll find her? None. We won't even look for her. What will you tell him when he asks about her? You'll worry about that when he takes us to the Amber Room. You'll get to Koch's cell with the help of our hack Edmund Tokarz. He's a double agent that has exposed Kloss to us. You'll then go to West Berlin, to meet with Brunner. Major Socha will cover you there. You'll pass to him all the information you can get about the Amber Room The doctor's here to visit you. You're not a doctor. Why are you wearing this disguise? It's the only way for us to talk without witnesses. How did you manage to visit me in this disguise? Our mutual acquaintances have friends even here. Hans Kloss. What do you want? I can see our people were stealing for us from the same box... it's the only souvenir I got from the war. You have a death sentence, but the Poles won't execute it. They hope that you'll finally confess where the Amber Room is. There is such a theory The Room belong to the Reich. The Reich doesn't exist anymore. The Third one doesn't. This is a picture taken a week ago. Do you know who is next to me? It's impossible. It was confirmed that he died in Berlin... Reichminister Bormann wants you to immediately and unconditionally return the Third Reich's property that you've been keeping. Ringle has hidden the Room. He didn't manage to tell me where, because he had been murdered... You're a traitor! Together with the officers from the SS, Ringle and Lau, you attacked the transport and simulated before Reichminister Bormann, that it had sunk. Maybe the Poles are hesitating with your execution, but we don't have any mercy for the traitors... Bormann is a psychopath. But what can he do to me, here? We will find someone in this prison who will kill you for a packet of cigarettes... But if you cooperate, you can calmly spend your old age here... Old age in a death cell... So you prefer to die? Ringle described the place of where the Room was hidden in the log book of the U-boat. Whoever murdered Ringle, is in its possession. Am I supposed to believe your word? Reichminister will want a definite proof. Ringle was to code the message about hiding the Room To read the code you need a "mother". That's another text... I know what that is. I have that "mother". Where? May the Bible inspire you. Especially those fragments that I have marked. Every word is important, even the numbers of the verses... That will have to do to get you to the Room. If not, then even the Book of Revelation won't help you. Hello Hans, my new friend. Don't sulk anymore, I have a glass of good Cognac in the car, waiting for you... Follow that black Mercedes. Well? Why didn't you give it to that hack? It's my man, Volksdeutche... Only I know about his dark past from the war. Because I should get more than twenty thousand marks. Isn't that enough? The Bible and Koch's leads won't help you if you don't have the log book from the U-boat, in which Ringle has coded the place where he's hidden the Amber Room. So what? You want the Bible? Then you already have the log book, because you were the one who murdered Ringle. Take the gun away while I still want to talk to you! Why shouldn't I take the Bible from you? Because only I can read it. I was just joking, Hans. I've been thinking... l have the log book, you have the Bible. Why do we even need Werner and Bormann? We're going to need them. Know what, Hans? You're really annoying. Just like that Pole that was impersonating you throughout the war... When I got Ringle, he was on his way back on the boat without the cargo. When he left Pilau, he managed to hide somewhere the boxes with the Amber Room. I'm going to the quarters at the harbour master's office. Turn left past the gate and you'll be given the keys at the guardroom. You wanted to murder the most faithful SS officer? Put'em up! Your gun... You thought I got eaten by fish? You swine... You rat... You wanted to grab the property of the Reich? Who gave you the Iron Cross? Adolf Hitler. Fuhrer has made a mistake...? Take it off! I followed the orders of Gauleiter Koch. What are the coordinates of the Amber Room? Maybe... Lau has got them? I don't know. Bravo Brunner... They are in the log book off the U-boat. Where's the log book? I don't know. In my briefcase. Coordinates are of no use, Brunner. They've been coded. And the "mother" to break the code is with Koch. I've burnt mine. You know that it's all coming to an end. And, have you got it? Send a telegram to Werner, that we will meet near Rostock. In East Germany? What are you scheming?! When Ringle was hiding the Amber Room in 1945, he didn't know that it's going to turn into GDR. How am I supposed to cross the Eastern Block border? There's only one way Stop the wars! Make love not war. Free love! Note down these coordinates: 54Âº 05' 20" North... 12Âº 08' 24" East. That's around Rostock. I won't manage to get there before them. You've got to ask Germans to help. But they'll cheat us out of it and we'll lose the Room! Call Stasi. I like this Eastern German uniform. But I look good in everything. Where's Reichsminister Bormann? We do have our comrades in the authorities, but we decided that Reichsminister's personal presence here is an unnecessary risk. Do you think otherwise? I think this is where the Amber Room is hidden. Faster! I'd get there on a bike a long time ago! Captain, we can't find him. We've turned right, but there is no exit... But I said left... I must have misunderstood... The officer from Poland is furious, he wants us to wait for his superior to come, he says that their agent is with the suspects. For now we are still waiting for those suspects... The officer from Poland isn't the one in charge of this action, I am! If an agent is there, then we must do something all the more! Focus on the road, because you've been lost for an hour! Yes sir, major... Please forgive me. According to the decoded message, Ringle arrived here from Pilau and hid the boxes somewhere on the Baltic shore. Are you kidding me, Hans?! There's nothing here! Stay here and look out... for everything. I told you, there's nothing here. There're three of them and they're unarmed. Let's go downstairs and look around. And after we return to the hotel, we'll decode the data again and this time. You'll explain to us in details how you did it. I've read the coordinationâ€™s correctly One moment... REV.. 21 .6 The Revelation of Saint John. Section 21 verse 6 "And he said to me... I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give the thirsty a sip of the source of water of life." Jewish superstitions. And what, according to you, does that mean? The source of water of life... Let's go, gentlemen. TNT can be unstable after thirty years. Brilliant work of art, I've been looking for it for thirty years, my miracle. Don't touch it, you might damage it. Find me something, so I can gently open it... Enough, mister J23. We can manage from here. Put your gun away idiot, or I'll lose my patience. You thought you'll win over me. You've never had a chance, because you've always underestimated me. And always thought highly of yourself, bastard. Lost your tongue? What's the meaning of this, Brunner? Take a look at this, sir. "You've won, Schtetke. I'm Polish. I'm glad I've managed to thwart your plans a bit. Hans Kloss... identical handwriting... You'll be hanged, Brunner. Justice will find you, if not here, then in Argentina. You'll end up like you should. Maybe I will... But it'll be over for you here and now. Rignt. Finish him, Brunner. Bye... Hans... or whatever your name is... I'm cooperating with the Polish counter-intelligence! Where is major Czubak and captain Socha? They'll be here soon, come out... You came at the last... He has no gun, finish him. Lau, you're alive? It's Standartenfuhrer Lau for you, you mongrel. Brunner... I've heard legends from our comrades about this notebook. In GDR alone you've been blackmailing around fifty of us! I come here on the orders of Martin Bormann. You old fool! Bormann has been dead for thirty years. I've slogged away for STASI for 25 years, looking for this place. When Americans caught Koch around Rostock in 1945, I knew that he was here to secure the Room. But it was you who brought me here. Now you're useless... Kloss! Don't wait for your comrades! They're not coming! Can you imagine what I felt when Socha called and said they got a new agent, who found the Amber Room?! My Amber Room! It's mine, Kloss! Want to steal it from me?! Then come! One thing I didn't understand was how you got away from the Russians! Until today you bolshevik snooper! I'm Polish! We've got to close the door. You steal up on them from this side, I'll go there. He's at 12 o'clock! Marcus, I got him! We'll meet in hell. It's better for you if we don't. Is the Room there?! It can explode anytime. Let's go! Faster! Hurry up! Did you see Brunner inside? No. Nobody's survived this! We've got all of them. Get me a crowbar. There's a great surprise awaiting us, comrades. Open it! Open them all! You won't destroy it! Koch, you vengeful son of a bitch... I wasn't in it for the Room. For what then? For Bormann and the others... You're breathing fresh air grandpa? Where's Brunner? Dead... Or he's escaped. What about Werner? We can't possibly call that a success, now can we? What about this? What does that mean? It means, J23 is active again. And where's the Amber Room? I guess it has to wait for better times. We have a surprise for you as well... Hans... Hans... You've found me... I promised... My God... So many years... You remembered, Hans. My name is not Hans. I don't understand... I'll explain at home... Because you're finally coming home Elsie. The war is over... As long as you're alive, Hans... The war isn't over for us... And in our war, the stake... ls your death... Erich Koch died in prison at Barczewo in 1986. He was 90 years old. Despite many attempts by the Polish authorities, Koch never revealed the whereabouts, of the biggest art treasure looted during the II World War - the Amber Room.
