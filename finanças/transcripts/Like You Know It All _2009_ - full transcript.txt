LIKE YOU KNOW IT ALL Jecheon, Summer, 2008 Sorry to make you wait. No, don't worry. I stopped for some bread. This way. - Bread? - Get in. Miss Gong? Director Ku! Hi, great to meet you. How do you do? Thanks. - Must be tired from the journey. - I'm fine. I stayed up last night, so I slept on the bus. I woke up and here I was. I can't normally sleep on buses but I slept like a baby. - I feel good. - Take this. What's all this? The schedule and festival booklet. - And the ID. - OK. - Who's driving? - Inseok's in the van. You're doing well. Keep up the good work. We will. Are you two dating? You're always together. Thanks for the ride. I'll buy you a drink. - Really? - That'd be great. It's a deal, then. We'll look forward to it. O.K. - See you later. - See you. Why make a promise you won't keep? Sorry? They think you meant it. They'll wait for you. You didn't mean it, did you? I'll keep my word. Yeah, right. Will you find the time? You'll be too busy judging. Well, it's up to you. Hi. Sorry, I can't come. I'm sorry. Why not? I just can't, that's all. You said you were coming. I've been waiting. You're always like this. Everything on a whim. That's unfair. The critics group is there. I won't be able to spend time with you. - They're all here? - Yeah. What for? The festival director gave them free rooms. It's an excuse to hang out. It'll be too risky, though. Forget it. You care too much about trivial things. They're important to me Everything's important. Yeah, whatever. Everything's important. Have a good time. Don't go into a sulk. Please don't whine at me. So tiresome. This is so annoying. This is getting too tough. It's tough for me too. She's too stubborn. I had some herb rice for breakfast. You speak English well. Where did you learn? You haven't been introduced. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I read your article in 'Cine 21'. Which one? Maybe a month ago. - Don't remember exactly. - Here he is. I did write one then. Anyway, it was excellent. Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you. Great to meet you. Hi, I'm Oh Jinsook. Great to meet you. So great. - That hurts! - I'm sorry. Are you O.K.? Going back to what I was saying. The doctor did something wrong. He cut off too much foreskin. The skin around the balls got pulled up. That must have hurt. - The doctor was jealous of me. - Jealous? Thanks for coming. I'll talk about the festival's aims. Bear them in mind as you judge the films. We'll then have lunch. It's the best place in town. I wasn't going to say it but as we're drinking, I'll say it. I'm a big fan. When I'm asked about my favorite actress, I always say it's you. It's so great to meet you. Not sure if I deserve the praise. I'll say something too. You are a great director. I admire you. You're a true artist. Really? Thank you. It's such an honor. Gently now. Oh, yes. How about making a film together? That'd be great. Must be nice to get such praise from her. Can I have a light? Thanks. Your films gave mean insight into human psychology. Really? Thank you. Wouldn't have understood some people without your films. Everyone's off to the screening? I have to call someone from the hotel. Really? Have to sort out something for my next film. Make sure you watch the film. Of course. - Coming to the party? - I'll be there. O.K. How will you go to the hotel? I'll get a taxi. - See you later. - Thanks. See you soon. See you later. I'll rest until the party. I'll be nice to everyone there. Gong is nice to me. Might be able to work with Oh. Got to find a story for her. What did Jo say? 'An understanding of human nature. ' That was it. Do you want to jump in? Sorry? Go ahead. No, I was looking at a frog. Where? It's gone now. How's the judging going? It feels bit awkward. Why did you agree to do it then? Many good films get buried unfairly. I want to do my bit to give them a chance. That sounds good. You're tall for a Korean. Really? Do you like it? It's good to be tall. Only short people say height doesn't matter. Excuse me. Here you are. Thanks. You're a judge here, right? How is it? Many good films get buried. I want to give them a chance. Like your films? They're different. They haven't been buried totally. That's right. She's a porn actress who was in a bogus art film recently. Who's this? My mother. She came with me. How do you do? Good to meet you. You're a great director. It's an honor. Give my girl a chance, please. She's counting on all you directors. You make all the decisions, right? It's a team effort. You look young. I'd love a long chat. You can enlighten me about life. Yes, someday. She is a nice girl. You think so? Director Ku! Director Kim's here. Hi. Director Ku, good to see you. What brings you here? Hello. Good to see you. You two close? We go way back. They're doing a retrospective of my films. It sounds so grand. A retrospective on him. He used to follow me around but he's big and famous. You're too young for that. Should do one right before I die. Were you always this short? What's it like to judge other people's films? You know how it is. Why so serious today? Huh? Is it because you're a judge? Very funny. Have you always called me 'Director Ku?' - Always. - Right. I'm Oh Jeonghee. It's an honor. I've seen your work. Really? Please forget it all. I beg you. The more you do it, the better you'll get. After seeing your films I said, 'This is a genius who's achieved greatness with just three films. ' That's over-the-top. What is? Welcome to the festival. I head the executive office. - Nice to meet you. - Great to meet you. He brings more integrity to the festival. We're so grateful. If you need anything, let us know. Thanks. The frog can't remember his tadpole days. You're a real drinker. I can out drink anyone, even men. That's amazing. I've not drunk so much in years. Really? You're a born drinker. I love drinking. I'll go in now. Go on without me. You can't do that. Can't leave us like this in your own room. You'd better watch your drinking. Just one more round. Sorry. I have to go to bed. We can keep going. It's empty. A toast? You're my college junior, right? Don't get cocky. Sorry? Why are you so rude? You're my junior! Cheeky cow! A toast, then. The two women are having a drinking contest. This is fun. I've had too much. I'm going. Are you O.K.? - Too dangerous here. - Stay. Don't get up. - Good night. - Night. Good night. Cheers. I've drunk a lot and talked too much. I don't normally talk about myself. But I'll say this. It's a pity Director Kim's not here. But I... Gong was holding onto the toilet, vomiting, and never opened the door to us. Why the fuss? I just want to sleep. - Go to your own room. - Let go! - You can't sleep here. - I want to. Wait, my bag. - I want to. - Get hers too. Stop it! Let's go. Stop it! Let go! I want to stay. My next film will draw two million. A film for two million. I swear. Can I have your autograph? - What's your name? - Choi Dorim. - Is it ok? - Thank you. - Are you from Seoul? - Yes, I am. - I see. - Yes. - You're far from home. - Yes. Hey! Hi! Bye. Thought I'd seen a ghost. What are you doing here? I live here. It's been two years. - I'm from here. - Really? What are you doing here? I moved down for good. Weird, huh? I see. Was she a fan? No, she collects autographs. You're still a playboy. Very funny. I know all about you. Nothing I don't know. What do you know? Everything. Want me to shout it out? Ku is a skirt chaser! Lock up your daughters! - Lock up tight! - Stop it. Hey, playboy! It's boiling. The weather's gone crazy. - Sure you have time? - Let's eat together at least. Long ago, I was having coffee when he came up and introduced himself. We drank that night and became friends. He wanted make films with me. He had real passion and was devoted to me. Two weeks later we set up a firm. But he had high ideals and a drinking problem. I moved out three months later. He had it tough for some time, made a film nobody knew about. I heard he was in hospital for kidney problems, and that he moved to the country. - Is it a big restaurant? - Quite big. I make enough. Don't need much anyway. Really? I wanted to sell it after my father died but it wasn't easy to find another job. Everything's sorted out. My wife does all the work. Sounds like a good wife. Not sure how to say this. She's my guiding light, my destiny. I see. Not sure how this sounds, I'd be dead now if it wasn't for her. You got married two years ago? I've known her since she was a kid. We met when I was in high school. Good to see you settled down. I have a new life. No need to go to church. I've found my soul mate. I didn't believe in love before. All my relationships ended badly. But you know what? There is such a thing as a soul mate. We are unhappy when we're not with our true soul mate. It's not about money or success, or having good parents. With your soul mate, everything falls into place. Right. I'd be dead now if it wasn't for her. I've got three films for tomorrow. But we might never meet again. Don't be so dramatic. We'll meet again. Last time was eight years ago. Why go all the way to your place? Want to go to a place with bar girls? I never said that. You're a skirt chaser. I didn't expect to see you then. I was so jealous, I almost went. But how could I? You're the only friend I respect. Is your place far? Very close. Call your wife. Feel bad going there drunk. She's an angel. She knows all about you. Really? He said it was near but it took forty minutes. Are you O.K.? Here we are. - Wow... - What? You're my first guest. I never invite anyone. Why not? I don't want people messing up my place. You're crazy. I never invite anyone. Really? He said the house is a hundred years old. Why am I here when I have a hotel room? Yushin! This is delicious. - Hope you enjoy it. - Thanks. - You have lovely eyes. - Huh? Cute, droopy eyes. I was expecting a depraved look. Really? I know what you're like, though. How? I can tell from your films. What am I like? You can't ask me that. He thinks people can't tell. Do you work? She was a ballet dancer but gave it up. Might start teaching kids. Ballet's not important. We have to ask what's important. What's really important? A mere stone exists for a reason but we'll never know. What could be meaningful when we don't even know who we are? Do you know who you are? I had spiritual healing sessions. They were expensive. I'm wary of superstitions but I trusted the healer. I was lying there and he asked me who I was. I didn't know what to say. But after a few days, suddenly, it happened. I heard a voice and saw it, with all my senses. The voice said, 'Oh, you poor thing. ' I'm getting all teary. It's alright. It said, 'live for yourself. ' 'You've never done that. ' So I started doing just that. That night, I ate everything I'd wanted to eat. When the healer asked, the others said they were trees or water. But I said I was 'light. ' I told you so. But that's what Jesus said. We are light, we are made of light. But no one knows what we are, how beautiful we are. Our Father! But now I know. - I cried so much then. - It's alright. You must understand what I've gone through, right? Of course. People say I've totally changed. I had this miserable look before. You did good. I'm sure he understands. She's an angel, isn't she? As long as she's good to you. Not sure if she's an angel though. You don't know her well yet. People often misunderstand her. Unlike others, she can never be untruthful. She's never untrue to herself! No human being could be like that. If I'm not a human being, what am I? This is supposed to be a happy occasion. Have some of this. It's cold here. No. I'll drink soju. Are they fighting because of me? What's wrong? He's dead. What do I do? Can't be true. Is he really? He's dead. He just stopped breathing. He was snoring and suddenly stopped breathing. Oh, no. He's dead. How can this happen? - He's dead, isn't he? - Yes. What do I do? How can I go on? Can't go on without him. The only one who truly loved me. What do I do? I know. Don't cry. You poor thing. Here. Thanks. Thanks to you he died. If you hadn't made him drink, he wouldn't have died. You killed him, bastard! I know. Don't scream. You killed him! I'll take responsibility. What do I do? I'll become a good man for you. You're not married, are you? No. I don't have money but I have a skill. I'll make films people like, and rake it in for you. Can we start a new life? We'll have a new life. Yushin. I love you. That's strange. She doesn't oversleep normally. You'll have to go without seeing her. - Sorry to leave so early. - Don't worry. Strange she's still asleep. Sorry about this. Maybe she's not well. Who knows? Look, I was thinking last night. You should have your own production firm. Don't know. You've built up a reputation. Be more aggressive. Make more films, get more people to see them. Yeah, right. I can help you run the company, raise the funds. Your films are cheap to make anyway. Not sure yet. To Ku. Should not meet you in person. I've stopped considering you as a human being. How drunk you were last night is irrelevant. I was going to inflict serious harm on you. This is to let you know how I despise you. This friendship is over. The least you can do is never come near our place. Bu. - How's it going? - Hi. The walkway here is lovely. Sounds nice. Getting ready for a new film? Yes. Would you really be interested? Just give a call any time. - Do you mean it? - Yes. Can I take a photo of you? O.K. How many photos of actresses on that? I don't have any. Sorry, I have to hurry somewhere. Where to? I need to sort out a misunderstanding. Good luck. I'm so excited about working together. Right. - Oh, my God! - Don't be frightened. Get Bu for me. He's here! What? I told you not to come! How dare you show your face! Why are you shouting? You have no idea. Stop it! There's no point! Let go! Fucking asshole! You're dead! How dare you! I could kill you now! Why are you doing this? You have no idea! Shut up, fucking asshole! I'll kill you! O.K. I'm going. It's alright now. He's gone. Let go. It's been a tough day for me. I know. Sorry. I'll be good to you, I promise. Don't leave me. You know I won't. I'd never leave you, baby. Luckily I won't need stitches. I'll go back to Seoul. Can't do anything here. I'll say I'll watch the films on DVDs. They'll prefer that to me just quitting. Gong said she'd come to the hotel. She gave me eight DVDs in bubble wrapping. I'll let them know what I think in two days. She tidied up all the loose ends. This is a nice walkway. Sorry to keep bothering you. Tell the other judges I'm sorry. Don't make promises you can't keep. You never bought drinks for the volunteers. You're always drinking yourself. Yes, sorry. Why are you like that? Pardon? That night, you got everyone to leave. Sorry? You led everyone out of the room. Oh, that night? The door wouldn't open after we came out. You have no idea how crazy that woman was. So you just left me there? Are you crazy? I don't understand... Was it normal to leave a defenseless woman there? Did you have a hard time? A hard time? I was raped. What? Defenseless and drunk and you'd left me there. That's why I was raped. Is it true? I feel so filthy! Know how I felt walking out of the room? It never happened to me before. It's all your fault, you shit! Fucking bastard! Oh, shut up. I couldn't put up a real fight. I was too drunk. He wouldn't have done it otherwise. You're so irresponsible. I wanted to kill you for what you did! He's an animal! Yes, he is. But I was too drunk. But you knew that, - right? - Yes, I did. I never want to see your face again. Never again! Do you mean that? You're all talk. Nothing but filth. Irresponsible, dirty shits. I want you all dead! Jeju Island Twelve days later Sorry, I stopped for some bread. - How have you been? - Get in. - Hello, professor. - You're early. How many are there? Not sure, sir. - This is Director Ku - Nice to meet you. My students are coming. They're dying to meet you. Hello. I'll carry these for you. You're doing a good job. I'll go in then. They're too nice. You have to be tough-minded to make films. Why's that? They're too bookish and nice. Wouldn't survive in the industry. Really? What happened to your face? I got into a fight. Up against three guys. I had no chance. What happened? One of them said, I was looking at his girl's legs. You were in the wrong then. I wasn't looking. The thugs just wanted a fight. You're still hot-blooded. No. I'm almost forty. You shouldn't get into fights. We got you a room at an expensive resort. It's normally 400 thousand won Yes, that's right. Wow, thank you. Mr. Goh is good friends with the resort owner. He gives us discounts when we have important guests. That's great. We got you two days, so you can have a good rest. Thank you. I was looking at the map. How many people live on Jeju Island? - Around 570 thousand? - That's right. Less than the population of a district in Seoul. Not many for a big island. What's Mount Halla like to climb? It's quite tough. Takes three hours to go up. Could take longer. That's possible. Six hours there and back. It takes a whole day. Thinking of going up? I might. I'll make preparations for the lecture. O.K. I wanted to pay you more but it was so complicated. Board meetings and so on. Endless red tape. They're very strong on being fair. Sorry, it's not much. Thank you. Pass those round. - One each, now - Thanks. Thanks. Make sure everyone gets one. Enjoy! There are big letters all the way through. This DVD was a sample for a film festival. Pay attention! I didn't have a DVD at home so I got this from the film company. Sorry. Hope you enjoy it. Mr. Yhang. A round of applause. - Here for the film? - Yes. Don't worry, it's only just started. Sorry. Hi. - Here for the film? - Yes. You're Director Ku. Don't worry, the film's just started. Right. Nice to meet you. Good of you to come so far. It didn't take long. The film's just started. That's O.K. I've seen it already. Twice. Really? Thanks. Can I have a cigarette? Of course. Thanks. What are you doing here? - Just having a cigarette. - Go inside this minute! O.K. Hope you don't mind seeing it again. O.K. What do you feel like eating? Anything. I don't mind. How about some boiled pork? It's a local delicacy. Boiled pork? I don't know. Tell me what you want then. Something ordinary. Something ordinary? - Sashimi, maybe. - Sashimi? Where should we go for that? Let's just have anything. You know Mr. Yang, the painter. He's coming. I have to let him know where we're going. Really? He's coming to see you. I'm surprised he remembers you. He never comes out usually. That's great. I've wanted to see him. Everyone wants to see him. Where'd be good for sashimi? How is he? He got married. You might know his wife. She's our college junior. I didn't know her at college though. Really? Is it his second marriage? He dragged things on and got a divorce two years ago. He married again last year. I see. Who is she? I have to think about that before I tell you. It's about his privacy. I can'tjust tell you. You understand, right? Yes. He wouldn't want me to divulge his private matters. I see. As long as he's happy. Why wouldn't he be? He has everything. Right. I haven't prepared a formal lecture. If you have any questions, as I answer them, I'll come up with things I want to say. I love films and I know a lot goes into making films. But why do you make films like this? Sorry? I don't understand why you make films like this. People don't understand your films anyway, so why keep making them? A sharp question. If you don't get it, then you don't. I just make them and the rest is up to you. My films are not dramas that you're used to. No clear messages, ambiguous at best. No beautiful images, either. I can only do one thing I jump into the process without preconceived ideas. I gather the pieces I discover and make them into one. You might not like the result. No one might. I believe all precious things in life are free. I want to be modest. What's so modest about that? Aren't you being irresponsible? Asking myself what I really know. Seeing everything a fresh without fixed ideas. Finding something new, appreciating each moment. Right now! You're not a film director, but a philosopher. What? Any more questions? I can't stand upstarts and rude people. If you want me to buy you a drink, I'll do that any time. Even after you graduate. But don't get cheeky with me, just because I drink with you. - Ok? - We won't. - Promise? - Yes, sir. Now, do you know who cries morning and night? Morning and night? Think hard. He works hard for his popularity. A crazy woman! That's so lame. Can I pour you one? Thanks. I enjoyed your film. Thanks. Can I ask you something? What is the most important thing in life for you? The most important thing? I don't mean things like your kids or your health. Freedom. We're unhappy needlessly, because we chase false ideals and other people's desires. It's the strength to focus on one's true desires. That's freedom. How about an arm wrestle? An arm wrestle? Go on, sir. Please, sir. One, two, three. Move over. I want to try. One, two, three. Move over. Excuse me. - The alcohol's got me energized. - One, two, three. Is that all you've got? How embarrassing! Have a go, sir. This way, sir. What did I say earlier? Don't be cheeky! Have a go, Mr. Yhang. This is fun. Shall I? Please be careful. - I'm not sure about this. - One, two, three. Is that it? - Giving it all you've got? - Yes, I am. Here we go then. You're strong. You're not bad yourself. It's tough even for younger men to last that long. Your shoulder might hurt tomorrow. It could go on for days. Let's drink. Cheers. No, go ahead. Can I have your autograph? - My autograph? - I enjoyed your film. Really? - What's your name? - Joo Euikyung. Ku! Sir! I thought you weren't coming. It's been a long time. Someone you're with? What? No, she isn't. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. Hello. How have you been? It's great to see you. Can I have a hug? Right, let's all go in. Come on. Come on in. Have you been drinking? Yes, I met someone on the way. It's not a grand place but I did my best for you. We went to a karaoke place with all the students. It's a rare privilege to spend time with Mr. Yang. He's the pride of Jeju and a living legend in Korean art. A toast to you, sir. Thanks. I appreciate it. I wasn't going to say it but as we're all drinking, I'll make a confession. You're the reason for my becoming a film director. Really? We met in the college office in my first year, I remember. You were a lecturer then. You said 'You'd be no good as a painter. How about a film director instead?' I thought about that all night. That was the beginning. It may have been a drunken word from you. But it changed my whole life. I feel lucky. - Thank you. - I remember. Really? I was just being honest. I really respect you, sir. Thank you. But it wasn't in the office. It was the campus field. I remember clearly. We were looking at the green field. I liked what I said. It was a good speech. No, we were in the office. You were drinking then. I have a very good memory. My memory's excellent. We were looking at the green field when I told you that. I remember clearly. Not true. It was in the office. Are you contradicting me? Think I can't remember? He said it was the field. Stop insisting. Mr. Yang wanted a quiet drinkin my room. If you're greedy to know everything, you'll discover nothing new. The wrong process will only mean a bad result. Conventionality is the worst crime in art. Art is all about creating something new for the senses. Jump into the water with a blank canvas. You're a genius. How do you feel when people call you that? I'm not a genius. Can I ask you something? Of course. What's the most important thing in life for you? You can enlighten me about life. Everything's important. Everything is useful. But the most important thing is the sincerity in trying to live by your own beliefs. No one else's but your own. You're so right. Everything's important. Can you lift up your bangs? Her bangs? Very pretty. You think so? Don't hide anything. It's absurd to pretend to be someone else. I'm talking too much. No, what you said is true. You're right. I agree. You're fascinating. I'm going to have a lie down. Right There's a room by the bathroom. Or you can go upstairs. Don't worry. I can get violent when I'm drunk. I need to be kept in a room. The room by the bathroom then. Good night, sir. Cheers! He's had a lot. I need the bathroom. What's the most important thing in life for you? Everything. You said 'freedom' earlier. Freedom's important too. Can I have a look around upstairs? No, it's too messy. I'm going to bed. Wake me up later. Good night. - Is she really in the bathroom? - Who knows? Let's have another. O.K. It's nice and cozy now. Good morning. - Where's Professor Goh? - He left earlier. What are you doing? We're getting a cab when she comes out. You should have gone with Professor Goh. Good morning. Let's get some soup for the hangover. - I'll be right down. - O.K. Good morning. Oh dear. - Where's Mr. Yang? - He went out. Really? Lock the door. Leave the key at the front desk. Bye. Minjung! Bye. - My wife will be here soon. - I heard you got married. She's your college junior. I see. It's nice here. Yes. I get headaches in Seoul. I get tired after a day. I couldn't live anywhere else. It's lovely here. It's a blessing to have this island in Korea. It's my second marriage. Not sure how this sounds, but I've waited for her all my life. - You don't mind me saying this? - You must be happy. I leave everything to her. She's much younger but I let her decide everything. I'm living a new life. Got very drunk last night because I was with you. You too, right? I don't remember anything. I don't remember either. You drank a lot. That's right. There she is. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Don't know each other? You were at the same university. I might have seen you somewhere. I've seen you. Let's go. I know her. - Nice day today. - Yes, it is. You haven't changed. In my second year at college, I decided to study abroad. I didn't know Gosun well and we'd not talked much but I asked her to marry me and go with me. Confused as I was, I must've had special feelings for her. She asked for a day to think. The next day, she politely declined. Studying abroad was a bad idea and I returned a year late I didn't look for her but always wondered about her. I've been grateful to her for considering it for a whole day. Nice place. Not that special. Why do you say that? He loves this place. Whatever. - Thanks for inviting me. - I usually don't invite anyone. You're a special case. What are these for? For cutting grass. I do it myself. Really? Come in. Can you move over? Yes. - So many rock pieces. - Yes. Picked some up and some were gifts. Ah. How have you been? Why did you come? I really didn't know. Really? I knew he married my college junior. But I didn't know it was you. He must not know. Of course not. It'd be inconvenient. In that case, I'm happy to see you. Have some of this. Thank you. We're hungry. Please make us something. You never make tea for guests. - I do sometimes. - When do you ever? Is he that special? Oh, no, I'm not. What would you like? I'll make something yummy. She's a wonderful cook. Stop it. Really? I am a decent cook. I clean and cook better than most. That's great. I'd like some bean sprout soup. Bean sprout soup? Yes. You sure? Yes. That's too easy. I can make something more fancy. It's great with hot pepper paste. Why is there a huge waterway? When it rains, there's a fast current. It's quite something. I'll go have a look. Don't. It's dangerous. Not at all. Go after lunch. I'm sorry. What are you doing? Come back. Yes, sir. Is this the way to the sea? Yes. How far is it? Not sure. Maybe 500 meters. I'll be back. You can go by car later. Sorry. I'll be back soon. Come back. Lunch is waiting. See you later. Isn't that hot? That's too much. Looks good. - It's bad for your stomach. - Right. What did you see by the sea? Everything I'd forgotten about. Really? I'll tell you after I finish. Eat first. This is really good. Could have made you something nicer. This is perfect. Hello. What's that? It's for you. It's yummy. - Let's see. - Here you are. - It's good. - Really? You know him, right? Film director Ku. Of course. You're famous. - Hello. - Hello? Jo is a sculptor. I see. He lives over there. We're giving him a ride. I see. - Who made this? - My older sister. She's a good cook. She takes after mother. Bring us some more. Sure, I'll do that. He said he'd take me to a taxi stand but we stopped on the way. How's the squid? Very fresh. I envy you both, living here. We have a quiet life here. Drink rice wine and eat good food. And I love watching TV nowadays. I see. How did you two meet? A few years ago, I went to a beach nearby. There she was, lost in thought. I kept going back and she was there everyday. I see. I was just looking at the sea. - Can I say something? - Go on. There were three men. For my first, I chose a handsome man everyone liked. I made sacrifices for him. I never did that for anyone after him. But, I realized he didn't love me. I lost my virginity to him. Then, I became practical. I wanted someone sweet and have an easy life. I found someone who everyone thought was sweet. But he turned out to be lazy. I considered suicide for the first time. I didn't want to fail again. But he wouldn't change. Then I met the third one. He was intelligent and nice. I married him and worked hard at the marriage. But, I was becoming superficial. I felt old, taking care of this guy. He was really nice. But I became materialistic like everyone else. It wasn't his fault. It was me. Then I met him. I'd never considered older guys before. Never. But with him, I feel whole again. He's someone I can respect. - Did you like that? - Thanks. I envy you. Seeing you run, I could tell you're energetic. You look healthy yourself, with a good complexion. Thanks. How about an arm wrestle? An arm wrestle? Sounds fun. - I want to try. - I don't want to. How's your sex life? Almost non-existent. Here's a set limit to how much sex you can have in life. I had too much when I was young. Why do you embarrass us? Why are you so rude? Sorry. That's O.K. It's not O.K. I hate feeling embarrassed. I'm sorry. Let's go. Thanks. Thanks for the meal. They left without cleaning up! Dirty pigs! Shit! Your phone was off. How could you sleep? Didn't you know what was happening? This is so shameful. Everything's fucked up. She's a psycho. How will he handle this? She'll tell everyone. You don't know what she's like. She's kissed every professor at the university. Mr. Yang's in trouble. If you're old, you should be more careful. Something happened? Not yet. It's only a matter of time. Then why the fuss? She wanted it herself. What could she say? Who are you shouting at? Think you're so big? Watch your mouth, you shit! Hypocrite! You wanted her yourself. Full of shit! Don't patronize me. You fuck! Where are you! I'm coming right now! That's it. I'm hanging up. You don't scare me. Shit. - Hello. - Hello. I really want to go into the water. Dear Ku. This is to you, who hasn't changed at all. There've been four men in my life. I met the first when I was 23. All the girls liked him and I loved him to death. I broke up with him when I realized he didn't love me. I didn't want to be swayed by a man's handsome profile. I decided to find someone sweet and have a happy life. I figured living alone was stupid. I chose two men. One was so lazy he made me crazy and the other was nice, but being with him was meaningless. We were married for two years and we had no kids. Now I have a life with Mr. Yang. I respect him. He may be old but there's an innocence about him. If you want to see me, call me on this number. I want to see if we can be more than friends. Watching you have the meal, I thought that's the least we could do for us. Let me know what you think. Gosun. You were quick. Yes, I was. Let's talk a bit first. We have plenty of time. Really? It's good to see you. You're cuter and more handsome. Thanks. I've seen your films. They're just like you. You put your own life story in them! Can't talk about anything else. I don't even know myself. You're so pretty! Unbelievable. You're the most beautiful woman in the world. Really? The most beautiful. I've wanted to see you for a long time. I've really missed you. I've always been sad about what happened. You're my soul mate. Soul mate? If I'd married you, I wouldn't be like this. Sorry. I didn't know anything then. Come here. You're sweet, cute and handsome. I love you so much. Am I a bitch now? You're not a bitch. The person you called is unavailable Leave a message after the beep. Sir, this is Jo. Something urgent has come up. Please call me as soon as you can. It's very urgent. Please call me. I'll be waiting. You're my soul mate. What do you mean, 'soul mate'? I wouldn't worry about this or that woman. We'd build a tower of love, brick by brick. I'd stop despising myself, a human one minute, and an animal the next. But I'm only doing this today. I can do what I want. And I'm married. Let's be thankful for now. I'm going to have a good life. I have no complaints. He's a good man. Have a good life. You might not know, but I don't think he's a good man. What do you mean? I just don't think he is. Don't get jealous. But you're my soul mate. We're unhappy when we can't find the right one. Not because of lack of money or success. Thank you so much. Why didn't I look for you before? We put things off as long as we can. Until death. Now I realize, only one person can save me. And that's you. Thank you. Tell me I'm the one for you. I don't care if it's a lie. I don't want to lie. Don't then. What do I do now? Be grateful for now. We're together like this. I want more. Don't be greedy. - What's this? - What are you doing? - What do you want? - Get up! Please stop! Be quiet, you shit! Please stop! There's nothing there. I have to see to find out. Why are you going through it? Shut up, you shit! You know what you did? You directors are all fucked up! Do you have a conscience? With his wife! Fuck! What a mess! Want a fight, you dirty shit? You married? No What was this for? To hack me to death? Put that down! How impudent! Why isn't he calling? Turn him over to the police? - Let's wait for Mr. Yang. - Right. You're finished now. I'm exposing you to all the journalists! What a mess! Dirty shits! Filthy fucks! Can I go out for a cigarette? We just let him go out? We know who he is. He can't go anywhere. We've got his bag. - Is he famous? - Famous my ass. Didn't he get prizes abroad? I saw him on TV. - Was he on TV? - He was. He's a fraud. A dirty ass like that couldn't make anything. You're right. Let's look in his bag. Nothing but books. Please, stay. Sit down! Hello, sir. What is it? I have something to tell you. That's what happened. What shall we do? Is it true? Just as I saw it. I have to take your word for it, since I wasn't there. Please believe me. What shall we do? Bring her back. She might do something silly. How about him? He's run off, the dirty asshole. Mind your language. He's a person like you. Yes. Go tell her not to worry. I will. But, sir... Why are you crying? Has something happened to you? Go find her. Tell her I don't blame her and not to worry. But this is filthy! So unfair! Can I use your phone? - Where do you want to call? - A cell phone. - Go ahead. - Thanks. You must be worried. It's O.K. I have nothing to fear. If he leaves me, that's it. I did wrong. Why did you sleep with me? This is so complicated. You're so self-obsessed. We didn't even begin. You ran off earlier, remember? Stop it. You don't respect Mr. Yang. You're just using him. I'm off. Really? I'm not using him. He's a much better person than you. And not because of his money. You can never take things as they are. Why did you want to see me? You're young, I was bored. You men do it all the time. Was that it? I see. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a nymphomaniac. Why did you marry him then? He's just a better person than you. And he's good in bed, as good as you. You two have a sex life, after all? Think I'd go without? Grow cobwebs down there? Don't live your life like that. You'll end up alone. You don't know me. Don't be so presumptuous. Right. Why don't you admit you don't know it all? It's hard to get someone's heart, right? Yes. Promise me you won't make a film about me. Why not? Never mind. I don't care. I'm going, bye. Good luck. Call me if you need any help. Bye.
