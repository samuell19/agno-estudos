Bride ran away! Seems, she doesn't like the groom. Groom ran away, too. Seems, he likes the bride. Seems, they don't like them both. Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Wait, wait. Do you all like her so much? She likes all of us! Eight brands with a single soda! Hey you go. What happened? I helped to escape 8 groom and a bride. Enough! Jacket, you thought to become minister, doing marriages? You became MLA, stitching jackets. I am cleverer than you, as I became MLA, by rigging. Hey, what will you answer, when minister asked about those 25 couples? Uh! Do you need the poster? Minister, you haven't considered me, though am servicing to the party about 25 years. You are supporting to him, who stitched your wife jackets. Are you against me? Look at his face, like a full moon. Brother, why are you shredding your own poster? No one should doubt on us. What are you doing, dear? You have not stopped your tailoring activity, even after you became MLA. The great Ramojirao will have his own pickles daily. We should not forget the past. Ok, did you remember what I said yesterday? Wait, I will recollect. Yesterday morning at 5 o'clock, cock has crowd. Enough, do you at least remember about marriages of 25 couples? How would I forget it? I will become famous after this event. Oh yes, phone rings as a good sign. Hello... Sir, 8 grooms and one bride are escaped from here. Oh dear. I feel like my heart is getting stitched on machine. What happened? 8 grooms and one bride are escaped, it seems. Why do you worry about it, you can take help from your follower Veerababu. Give it to me. Hey, call Veerababu. Hey, Veerababu is kidnapping youngsters, as grooms are shortage for marriages conducted by MLA. Don't go to town side. (WHO IS HE...? WHO CARRYING YOU.? WHOM IS HE BORN TO...?) Hey... Not just town side, shouldn't go to pond side too. Leave me. Leave me. Bars should be open by 6 a.m. Drinkers should be provided with pension. They should be freely delivered to home, after completely exhausted. Get in. Why...? Home delivery. Gov't responded so soon! Let's go. Sir, I am single, please give me something. I'll give you a wife. Get in. Oh...! Hey catch it... Catch it... Catch. Out. Hey, Leave me. Sir, I have a best offer for you, if you buy paste, brush is free. We have even better offer for you. What's that? If you get married, you will get a golden ring free. Is it? Come on... take him. Come on... move. Why you are behind me, leave me. Hey stop. Veerababu, what about this mug? Take it, can be used to wash his legs. Damn...! I took it to wash my seat, not for feet. This is called fate. Let's go. No one else know that we three are here, is it? No. Except we four, nobody knows. Catch them. Come on take him. Veerababu, we need one more. One more, is it? We should get him. (GIVE ME ONE GREAT KISS...) Sorry uncle, I thought it is Krishnaveni. It is just 30 minutes you got wedding cards, you already went on dreams. Thank god I am not bleeding. Uncle come back home after distributing cards at Gopalapeta. Suribabu. Veerababu, hug me. Happy Friendship dude. Same to you. Why you are so late? I got wedding cards in the morning, I just placed the first card at temple. So, I got late. Hey, you took my bananas. Sorry uncle. I thought it is mine, as it was besides me. Hey, you come, he is thinking that everything besides him is belongs to him. Hey what's this dude? I don't know what I am doing, in the happiness of my marriage. Hey, at any cost, my marriage should be done with blessings of our MLA, Jacket. Okay dude... He is there at wedding hall itself. You can meet him and get it done. Jacket Janakiram, long live. Jacket Janakiram, long live. Jacket Janakiram, long live. Greetings... You want to get married with your blessings. Is it? Hey speak out, dude. Yes Sir. It's my good luck to get married with your blessings. No, it's my good luck. Hey, take him inside and treat well. Sure. Wedding card... It's not a good sign, we will give it later. Let's get in. Please go. Reddy, Suri has come, give him tea. No one will doubt if I drink alcohol in a teacup. It's so strong. Is it stronger than this? Which brand is that? I think it is Red Label. Give it to me. Hey. Is it tea? What did you think about? I thought it is another Red Label. Sorry. Oh God, he made his shirt as t-shirt. Give him another shirt. Reddy, you kept it ready, is it ready made. No, it is Reddy made! I stitched it. Go, change it. Okay. Go... Idiot made it ugly. It is fitted, as if you stitched it for me. It will like that... when the time is in worst. He is telling that, everything will be fitted, if your time is good. Oh...! Veerababu.. What happened, why you are tensed? One among the 25 grooms is escaped. Escaped? Who is that? One who is brought for Pushpa! Oh God, MLA will get Heart Attack, if he come to know about it. That means he'll not come for my marriage. Stop it, dude. Veerababu, we left with only 10 minutes. I am doing adoration, otherwise I would have act as groom. Can anyone of you act, please? My wife will die, if she comes to know about it. My wife will kill me if she comes to know about it. Friend is not the one who is shares bikes back seat, one who pushes it when it is punctured. Is he really asking you to get married, is just asking you to act as groom. Are they really your friends? Cool dude. Why don' you act, instead of telling us. Hey, next month is my marriage. That's why, you will be practiced. Hey don't force him. Veerababu, I agree to act as a bride, but you failed to get a groom for me. I am trying, Pushpa. Listen, I will take bed and cot from MLA's marriage gifts. You can give gold ring to the groom who agreed to act. I don't mind. Dude, will they give a gold ring for those who are getting married here? Yes, they will give. But, I could not get the one who is willing to take it. If, I agree immediately I will lose my image. If not immediately, you lose ring. Do you know what a China's poet said about friendship? What he said? You can't understand as he said in Chinese language. Ok dude, for your sake I agree to act as a groom. Hey, you saved MLA's life. I want him to come for my marriage. You are my best friend. Same to you. You understand it right, I did it for relationship not for this ring. See Ms. Pushpa. You should get away from here as soon as you become Mrs. Pushpa. After that, we both are nothing to each other. Don't think as if you are Prabhas. Why do I marry you if I am Prabhas? Ok, Minister will come anytime, let's go. (JANAKIRAM, LONG LIVE.) (GOVARDHAN, LONG LIVE.) (JANAKIRAM, LONG LIVE.) (GOVARDHAN, LONG LIVE.) Greetings! Sir, bouquet. Please come sir. Hey, move away. Greetings! How are you all? Hey, move away. Move away. Greetings.. Come Mr Langa Bangaru Babu. How are you? Sir, my name is Lanka Bangaru Babu. Let it be. Hey, jacket. You both should work together as jacket and skirt for the party. Sure. Ok? Sure, sir. There will be always gap between jacket and skirt, they will not come together. Yes, I am on top and you are at bottom. Hey... Greetings... Greetings, minister. Hey Pushpa, how are you? Minister still remember me! How can I forget, Pushpa? God, she knows everybody. Greetings to everybody! I welcome honorable minister Govardhan for this event on behalf of Mr Jacket. So many people are trying to damage Mr jacket's image in the party and in public. Yes, you are right. We will not let them to do it until we are with him. Sorry brother, I slipped as I am on high dose. In this situation, I will slip my hand. Henceforth, instead of 25 pairs he will make it to 125 pairs. Is my smile ok? See how I do it. That's why... Brother, they are exactly 25 pairs here. Veerababu has overcome our plan, and saved Jacket's dignity. He sincerely grown up from the stage of stitching jackets to the MLA Janakiram. No doubt, he will become a Minister next to me. It's all your mercy. Till date used to tell that you are his son or brother in law. But now he is telling that Jacket is his political successor. May be he is a political successor, but I am for his wealth. (CHANTS...) (BLESSINGS...) Greetings, sir. Greetings. Greetings. Come on, Tie a knot... Hey... do it. Hello... please you help her. Hey not you, I should tie. I will tie it. You should not tie it to me. (BLESSINGS...) In a hurry I tied three knots. You idiot, drinker. Wait, I did not tie the Rakhi yet. (SONG HUMMING...) Hey, I will surprise my Krishnaveni showing this ring. Before that, cheers. Cheers. Hey dude, you forgot that you are on adoration and drinking alcohol. I was doing it to make 25 marriages, I did it, so I finished it. So, you involved me to escape on yourself. No dude. It's ok, I will leave you for this ring. That's why, you are trapped. If you ask me to marry anybody on the road, I will do it. But, that girl is great, she left a golden ring for me and took bed and cot with her. She is like a gold who doesn't care gold. Hey, somebody clicked gold's photo. Yes dude. When did you both acted for advertisement? This is not ad, it's my bad. What should I answer to my Krishnaveni. I want to kill who clicked this photo. Why dude, he captured it very nice. He took off my dignity. Take the call. Hello... Why did you marry a public figure like Pushpa, instead of a decent Krishnaveni. I tempted for the gold. By the way how did you know that her name is Pushpa. Not just me, entire state knows about her. She is a famous recording dancer. Recording dancer? (BACHELOR BOY BE WITH ME YOU WILL BECOME A BEST HUSBAND.) In addition to that, her mother, grandmother all is having group visa. They even go for the foreign tours. Because of you we lost our dignity in India and Overseas too. Stop it. It's just a dummy marriage. Don't discuss this topic with Krishnaveni's father. I got to know this from him. How did he know? It is a breaking news in TV. Breaking news? Are they using me too? Oh God! Hey, they would give 10 acres land as a dowry if I marry Krishnaveni. Now I lost both Krishnaveni and land too. Stop it dude. Tomorrow, will go to Krishnaveni's house, explain what happened. Why till tomorrow, let's go now itself. Everybody got to know about my marriage, is it? You are telling on yourself. Shut up and come. What happened Dasu. Car is not getting started. Come let's help him. It's my life matter there is it required now? Shut up and come. This side Veerababu. You be there. Do it properly. Hey, what are you doing? We are pushing the car. You... Are doing it as if you are trying for kids after you are operated for family planning. You do like this, if you are over drunk. Push it from the back side. Push it. What are you pushing at? I am pushing the car brother. I am so tired of pushing the car. You are not pushing the car you are pushing the air. Push it properly. Brother, you are Pushpa's husband, am I right? Hey... How could he recognise me that I am Pushpa's husband, even after drunk? Is that Minister post? It is more than that, you just push it. My fate! Brother. What? Don't hurt Pushpa at any time. If she gets hurt, will you commit suicide, I will kill you before that. Stop it. No brother. If you are prisoned killing me, Pushpa will become lonely. He is making her to his own. Hey, come on Push. I can't handle his torture ask him to leave or I will leave. Hey wait. Suribabu. You push it. Brother, what is that sound from the boot space? Nothing. The gas cylinders. Please push it. Silence. Why is he telling silence to the gas cylinder? Let's open it and see. Nothing is there. Who are you? Why are you playing in the car at midnight? Oh no... Oh no... She is beating Pushpa's husband, let's see her end. How dare you beat Pushpa's husband. Hey, what? What? You are a girl, otherwise. Otherwise! Oh no.. How can you break a boy's hand? I curse you that you will not get a baby boy. Hey.. Oh God, it's my mistake please leave me. Hey wait. Veerababu! She broke your hand. Hey, Suri... I cannot turn my neck and my hand is also not working. You are making us to push a car, where you are taking a girl to rape her. I can't do anything today, how could I do rape!? By the way, who is she? She is the daughter of Mangamma who started a hotel near to church. She is trying for a police job, it seems. Still trying? She is behaving like as if she is real police. We are playing cards in the night, as children will be there at daytime. Is it wrong? Not as much as playing in the daytime. Then why did she beat us? We are all together could catch her and place her in the boot space of the car. And planned to push it from the hill. In between we came and allowed to escape the devil, is it? Yes. Suribabu, check the phone call. Please check. Tell me dude. It's not me somebody Photoshop it. Please listen me. Who is that? It is Balu from Delhi. Oh..so what...? They posted my marriage photo on Facebook. Got 10000 likes in 10 minutes. It seems, he is very happy. Oh God, 10000 likes in just 10 minutes! Congratulations. My fate! Come out. Come... Move... Come out. Everybody, wait. Dude, you call them. 'Ammaaaa' Hey, seems beggars have come, give them left over food. What, are you guys roaming in autos for begging? What, are you guys roaming in autos for begging? You know, we are left and right for MLA. Hands! Your daughter broke our right and left hands. Why did you come to hotel? Go to the hospital. Doctor said, this case should be treated by the one who broke it. Oh girl... She looks different form yesterday! So much variation! Mom, who are they? What is happening? What are you looking at, don't you remember, last night while kidnapping you? How dare you to kidnap me. My hand will come out completely, we are not kidnapers, we saved you. Sorry, I thought you both are kidnapers, in the dark. Is it enough to say sorry, for what you have done for us. Hey, she apologies, leave it. Move aside. Its not your mistake, anyone in your place would do same way as you did. That's why, I will give your sorry back. I am sorry. What? Is it painful? Subbu, bring some oil. Come. Let's go, we shall to go a massage parlor. Come on... move. Girl, your cheeks are making me crave, as if they are tasty food. My heart expands as a Puri. When you rotating your belly as Chapati, made my breath boils like Upma. Your looks like Minapavada, made my heart beats heavy. Your curves like Uthappa, are made me to swing. Let's love each other life long, as Sambar Idli. Girl! Oh girl! Girl, your cheeks are making me crave, as if they are tasty food. My heart expands as a Puri. When you rotating your belly as Chapati, made my breath boils like Upma. If you are police like pepper in Pongal, I am politician like chilly in Bajji. You should arrest goons with Wada... I should grow like Modi, who became leader by selling Tea. Like coffee powder and milk mingles, we both should mingle. Like potato and Paratha, law and order should run. We should be like, mixed rice and curd. Girl! Oh girl! Girl, your cheeks are making me crave, as if they are tasty food. My heart expands as a Puri. Everybody... Just shake it baby... Oh come on baby... I will write wedding invitation on Pulka, which you make. I will make a marriage flexi with a paper Dosa, which you prepare. I will treat the lemon rice as blessing, which you prepared. I will tie them all Punuku, and put around your neck. Yellow in the egg is Thali, I will tie Maggi noodles like a yellow thread. Be with me, we will be like Pesarattu and Upma. Oh girl! Oh girl! Girl, your cheeks are making me crave, as if they are tasty food. My heart expands as a Puri. When you rotating your belly as Chapati, made my breath boils like Upma. Please, please Krishnaveni. Please listen to me, that's not the actual marriage, that's a drama marriage which I did for my friend. Don't you trust me? Alright, I will trust you. But, this society should trust you. After our marriage, what if she comes again and fight for you? She won't, she will be busy with all people. What if she comes. I can't handle her for life long. Get divorce papers, saying that you and Pushpa are separated. After that, we will marry each other. Otherwise, will you stay like this for entire life? No ways, I will marry my brother in-law Ramakrishna. Hey, Krishnaveni. I will come with divorce papers and I will give first wedding card to Ramakrishna. Like Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma, Veerababu and Vasanthi. How is the combination? What? Vasanthi! You both are not for each other. We both are made for each other I will become MLA, once Mr. Jacket becomes minister. Police and politician, is there any best combination than this? Mine and Pushpa's! I am supposed to roam to distribute wedding cards, but you made me to hold these divorce papers. And, you are planning for your own marriage. What are those divorce papers? I met Krishnaveni at temple and explained everything. She said, get divorce from Pushpa, otherwise we can't marry each other. Somehow, you speak with MLA and get these papers signed by Pushpa, please. Ok, I will speak with MLA. You come along with Pushpa. Thanks. What are you talking? I have seen her first and last time at marriage event itself. Or else, call her and ask where she is. I would I know her contact number? Don't you know your wife's contact number? My wife! Is she my wife? Hey, stop it. You made to marry her and now asking like this, idiots. I will kill you all. How do I get her number, now? 8790241948. How do you know her contact number? Am asking you, answer me. Hey wait, is that important now? First, call her. It has a meaning if a college going guy has her number, but he also got her number. Tell me! 879... 8.. 7.. 9... 0.. 2... 02... 41... 4.. 1... 94... 9.. 4... 8... The subscriber you have called is busy with other customer. Please wait on line. Busy with customers!

That's not Vasanthi, Chamomile. What items you have? Idli is ready. No, Dosa? It will take half an hour. I don't want. Chilli bajji? We prepare them in the evening. Then, we want them, we will wait till then. Till the evening? Meanwhile, get something to drink, at least. Hey what is that you have hot, tea or coffee? My sister is hot! Is it? I am feeling so chill ask her to come and hug me. Seems, they have not come to have anything. What happened, dear? I can't tolerate their torture. Wait dear, you want to become police. It will be difficult, if any case is filed against you. Give this money at Giri's shop. You go, I will take care of them. Hey, aunty is coming, somehow manage her. What is this, not fair what you are doing. One minute, aunty. He called at right time. Hello... I got an information about Pushpa. She did a program at Bellary, last night. Oh you! You are posted at Bellary? What is posting! There are posters of her everywhere. Police job, is it? By the way, is Bellary belongs to Karnataka government? Yes, do you think it is under Canada government. Don't worry, I will recommend you to transfer to Telangana state. If require, I will ask our MLA to speak with DGP. Hey what is the topic I am speaking and what you are answering for? Okay...? Shit, it's like one-way traffic to speak with him. Sorry aunty, you are saying something else. Nothing. I want to speak with you personally, please come inside. Sure. Come. My mother in law is calling me, I will go. Listen, it's a dream for my daughter to become police. You have good contacts with MLA, right. Take these 10 lacs and give her a job. Money is not required aunty, I can do it for Vasanti. No, just a recommendation is not enough. Money has to be transferred. She wanted to get a job on her merit. A year is passed, to realize that merit is not just enough. Please take it. Don't let her know about this. She doesn't like to give bribe. Sure, aunty. We should monitor for minimum 48 hours. After that? Should keep in ice box! Condition critical. It's great that he lived so long, for his lifestyle. Your Thali is so strong! Yes doctor, it is made of 12 grams. So thick! Sister, did brother in law speak anything? How dare he to speak in front of me? You fool, did he speak anything about 500 crores. No, but he asked to call Mr. Jacket Janakiram. Oh that guy...! Why? Maybe to stitch new jackets for me. Oh! You... when I am thinking about crores and you are thinking about jackets. Brother... something is happening between crores and jackets. Correct Abhijeet. Something wrong. Om cream ice cream! Om cream face cream! He is saying ice cream and face cream, is he really Baba? Shut up he is really powerful. He will show you missing people or missing things, by sketching on betel leaves. Oh...! Oh, leaves search as of Google search? Whose name has a power to make an older person active! Even a baby boy will play with ecstasy! The same form is coming by cat walking! God, all these are Pushpa's qualities. 36... 26... 36! Uncle, why is he telling measurements? Not measurements, they are sizes! That's what, why you are checking sizes instead of to finding the person? Sir, can I see it once? Just once. Baba, you are not an ordinary one you are glorious. I feel like I am saying Pushpa directly. She wore a green color saree. She must have worn a black color blouse too. How did you know without saying on leaf? See straight, you will be shocked. 2000 to show a person on leaf. 5000 if I bring the person directly to home. Give 5000 to baba and go. I could not find you anywhere in India, where were you? I went to Kashi to vanish my all sins. My image is damaged with this marriage. Rest of the life is with you. With me? When I ask you to act, why did you do it in real? Pushpa, where do I keep this bed? Inside my bedroom. Okay. Our bedroom? What is your scheme? Don't you understand, along with the ring this bed and cot are also for you. Father-in-law, please bless me. Stay happy, dear. Anyway, she will be happy. It's me who should roam around and do recording dance. Why are you supporting her? Please go inside. OK, your wish. Where are you going? My house. Your house? Are you blackmailing me? You are not my wife, just sign on the divorce papers and get out. You said I am not your wife, why should I sign? Brother in law, where should I keep the bed? Keep it in your back! Keep it in your back! I will give you money if you want, just sign on these papers. Why should I go? We are not married in secret, we married in public. If you want, ask our MLA to tell me. Oh, you are coming in this route? Wait, right now I'll bring our MLA here and make you sign on these papers. First you bring MLA here, we will see later. You stay here, I'll bring him in just 10 minutes. Don't go inside. Dear, please bring rice while coming, I need to cook. I will cook you! Good morning, brother. Veerababu, come in. Have breakfast. No, thank you sister in law. I just had. He is trying for a hotel owner's daughter. He might have had in full. Hey, is it true? Nothing like that sister-in-law, brother is just joking. Then why are you spending much time in hotel rather than in tailor shop or in Party office? Ask him. What are you waiting for? Ask them to come, we will speak. Minister sir is in serious condition, need to go to hospital. Keep my files in the car. Brother. Yes. Take this. What is this? Money, 10 lacs. 10 lacs, What for? My lover's mother has given this amount to post her SI job. I have taken money to stitch jackets. But, never to help people. I know you will not take. But you may need to give this to others. Moreover, it's a police job. Please brother, for my sake. Ok ok. Anyway, I am going to town, I will meet DGP Sadasivam, and I will speak about this. Greetings... Brother! Hey, Suri! Why are you tensed? Brother, please come with me. Where? Pushpa has come to my home, I should live with her it seems. Wife and husband should live together. She is not my wife. Other day, I pretended to be her husband, to save your dignity. He told you, didn't he? What is this? I will not do anything without telling you. Try to remember it. Early morning 5:00 a.m., cock has crowd. What is he telling about, when I am asking about marriage? Hey, you wait. I know how to remind him. Brother, we did not do 25 marriages that day. Why not, we have given all the gifts like ring, bed and cot to each couple. Nobody is escaped from there. Why not, you brought them back. Yes, I am the one among them. Minister has not come to the function. Why not, he came and greeted Pushpa who is standing beside him. Same Pushpa is asking me to live together. How is it possible, it's wrong! Now. You could understand it. I will get out of this problem, if you come and make her sign on these divorce papers. Let's go. Brother, wait. Minister's condition is serious it seems. He need to go on urgent. There is another important work too. Hey Suri, I will do your work after coming. Just give me 5 minutes, my house is on the way. You're getting late, please get in. Brother just 5 minutes, please. Let's go. Brother please. Leave him, let him go. Brother. Brother... don't forget about my work. I got to understand that, we should not trust the one who is behind the politician. Dude, I can understand your feelings, cool down. All of you come to the party office. Okay. Greetings... Where is minister? In gym! Is this time for kidding? You are kidding, do you think it is an IMAX theatre, club or pub? He is there in ICU. Okay. Hey brother. You should tell me whatever my brother in law tells you, inside. This is not comedy I am serious. Sure. Thank you. Hey.. Brother.. Brother in law's beard is grown up we will shave it after he becomes fine. Ok sir. Brother in law. See who has come. It's me Jacket. Mr. Jacket. Should I come there, tell me now brother in law. Tell me. Oh God, I am here nothing will happen to you. I am like dying, first you take out your legs from the oxygen pipe. Oh God, I am sorry. Idiot. Oh God, I am sorry. Go out. I am going out. Brother, do you remember what I told you. Yes. Thank you. I brought him up as I don't have children. Now he become threat to me. Hey.. Move. So far, I could earn money and respect, but I couldn't earn the dignity. Entire world knows about this, did you call me to say this? Not about that. Those 500 crores... Oh no... Who is that? It's me, I came to check the oxygen supply. Idiot, get out. Come out! You hide those 500 crores there? Transfer that amount to your account and use it for good being. Let me gain some dignity too. Sure sir. Don't discuss with that idiot. See you Sir. Why did he beat you being a brother in law? Brother, Yes. Why Mr. Langa is coming here? It seems, he is telling about money to all the public, instead of us. Greetings sir. Why did Minister call Mr. Jacket? He is calling every one of you to tell about 500 crores. Hey, stop kidding. Hey, Abhijeet. Yes, brother. First time in my life I told him the truth. But, why does he not believe it? Henceforth don't tell the truth for entire life I will not tell it for any of my life. Sir. Where is Mr. Jacket. I don't know. Where he hides himself? Mr. Jacket. Don't call that name I am getting irritated. We too, getting irritated. Hey Abhijeet, he looks like an elephant, how can he escape from this room? He cheated us. The word cheating is very famous in this state. He is also a cheat. Let's find him. Okay brother. Mr Langa, see you. Oh my god, he is escaping. Yes. Let's go. Start the vehicle. Look, I started rowdyism at the age of 10. I developed in politics by the age of 25. Not looking at my service but they gave me a party ticket looking at the murders I did. That Minister post should come only to me. I'll kill even if you come in my way and this is the final warning. Brother, Doctor is coming. Sorry, he is no more. Have you given a warning to dead body till now? I didn't expect he died. If you murdering with talks, is into the CC cameras, we will die. Come on, let's escape. Come on, move. There, he's going... We too are going, right bro? Take right... Take right... He's going. He's going. Come on, I'm going bro. Hey Abhijeet, I'll feed you a good Bawarchi Biryani. Where are you going this way? You said Bawarchi Biryani, right? You idiot, after the work is done and after we catch him and then is the Biryani. Turn back. I'm turning bro. Move on. Go... Go... Go on dude. Take a turn... Turn the way he turns. Hey, he's crossing the bridge on the river. Oh no... Oh no, vehicle turned upside down. Has he died by mistake? Oh God, no moment in the legs. You think, he's alive. Bro, it was you killing mercilessly by saying chasing. Is it to make an accident, when I said to go fast? If he dies, it's like we too are dead. Oh Goddess, you shall save us. Oh God, he should be alive (LIVE MY DEAR, YOU LIVE LIFELONG FOR HUNDRED YEARS...) Oh God, is he breathing from the nose? Hey, he's breathing. Hail Mysamma Goddess. Hey. My 500 crores are alive. Bring the vehicle and we shall take him to the hospital. Oh no Veerababu, what's all this? Please Control sister in law. Be with courage and nothing will happen to brother. Oh God...! See Veerababu, even those not taking money to vote are also crying means... It's definitely... Please control sister in law. Hey, why's he gone even without finishing his 5 year term? Stop it man, it's not the MLA sir who died. You continue madam. It's not brother. Take him on. How's brother Sir? MLA sir is into Coma getting a strong wound to his head. Oh God, it's my bad luck. A man not knowing even to put Allout for mosquitoes but just knows to stitch blouses is gone into Coma... Don't cry madam, we started the treatment and there's a chance that he'd come back to consciousness in 10 days. What if he doesn't come back? I'll not take back my word and say 10 days even then. You go and visit him. Go sister in law. MLA Sir, how long would it take for MLA Sir to come back into senses? Is there no any discount? This isn't any sari to give season discount but it's his blouse. Let even crores be spent but MLA Sir should be back to senses, go to the Assembly and say Speaker Sir... No problem even if 499 crores are spent. That is brother, not even a crore is left behind if he dies and... Come on, we shall go that way. Hey, I'd have settled the matter if he had come with me for five minutes. You said we shall look into after he comes. But the situation now is like we shall look at him when he's out from Coma. Hey, he'd come out fast and it's my guarantee. No idea when he's back from Coma and when he'd make Pushpa sign these divorce papers... Damn! As Jacket Jagannatham, MLA of Satynarayanapuram met with a dreaded road accident, he's admitted to KIMS hospital. Oh no, accident of MLA? It's like I lost 10 Lakhs. What's happened mom? Give these 10 Lakhs and get her a job Sir. Do you have any sense, idiot? Where were you when brother was driving the car? I'd been to drink water bro. How long would you drink water? I got late by the time I mix a quarter and drank. Wow, what a duty minded... Get out rascal. Veerababu... What, have you come to meet MLA Sir? No, we came to get BP checked. Do you have BP in such tender age? Won't we get a BP losing 10 Lakhs? That is... I said it getting a BP listening out accident. I don't like to get a job by bribing. We don't have a facility to get a bribe after getting jobs. Give our money back. What, do I look like any comedy villain? Your mom pleaded and put that money in my hands. I went and gave it to that MLA and MLA handed that to DGP Sadasivam. Maybe money changing banks would come into hands, but money changing hands would never come back I won't believe you I'm a loyal man and check by Googling if you wish to... I'll make that Sadasivam say if you still have doubts, come on. What dude, a new problem? Old one but started newly again. These aren't believing then I said to have give money to Sadasivam for a Police job. That's why taking these to make him say the truth. Why these to Sadasivam? He's coming here at 10 in the morning to meet MLA Sir. Heard right, come tomorrow. If he says not to have taken me, hit me on the spot with your slippers. Okay. Ok, we will come tomorrow morning. I'll bring a bag too while coming. Not a bag but get a large bag. Maybe he'd return with interest. Move dear. Thanks dude, you proved that real friend is the one saving in trouble. Thanks to you too. You proved real friend is that drowning down when in troubles. Ok, leave that topic now. Ok dude, how do you know that DGP Sadasivam is coming to meet MLA? DGP Sadasivam, who's that fellow? Hey, you just said right? Hey, I said about that snack vendor Sadasivam. It seems, he'd come tomorrow in the morning to feed MLA. That guy? I heard you and have said her that DGP Sadasivam is coming tomorrow morning, right? Leave it, you escaped today right? She said to hit me with slipper if he doesn't come tomorrow. Go in the night and steal her slippers. Then she'd buy new slippers and then hit. Let's do one thing, we'll go meet that DGP Sadasivam and ask him to come here tomorrow. Hey, you come to my house and offer me a bribe, rascal? Total magazine will enter your body if I press the trigger. Sorry Sir leave me. I made a mistake Sir. You're saved as I'm in uniform, get lost. Hello watchman, is DGP Sir inside? Go guys. Hey, why's he so much frightened? It's DGP right, he would have used him up well. Hey, we don't need to fear like him. We're the men of MLA Sir. We shall be strong and added he's taken money from us. Look dude, I'll dash in getting a narrow space. Come on. Sada... Sada... Dude Sada... House is quite big. He is taking 10 lakhs per post and it'd be at least so big. Hi Sada, how are you I'm Good I'm just average. There are so many shields. Did you rob all these and did you win? Hey, so many are for sale in the market for 500. Yes, just for fun dude. May I know who you are? Can we sit there and talk? I'm right and he's left for MLA Jacket. Hands. Oh...! You know that MLA met with an accident and is admitted in the hospital, right? He gave you 10 lakhs for the post of SI, right? We came to talk about that. By the way, get her posted right here. Why? Why do you question back? If you join her at Annavaram or Gannavarm, how does he meet? Use some common sense. Look dear, my guy already said her. All these Police jobs are done by the idle people and those with huge bellies like you. But she didn't care. Is it so? Ok, are you free? Why? Nothing, I promised my lover to bring you tomorrow. Why? What are questions like why, how? Are you born to a human or animal? Shut up and do what's said dear. You come tomorrow morning at 10:30 to hospital for seeing MLA. We'll send AC vehicle for pick up and drop. We'll also feed you chicken Biryani. With leg piece. Enjoy your self. Is there anything else? We wish to have a drink with you, if this deal is ok. Shall we go upstairs? Why, you can't get a kick drinking here? I think kick would be strong if upstairs. Added you brought the material and I should give the side dish, right? Wow, he knows how to respect. Order a prawn fry for me. And mutton fry for me. Sure. Dear, this is imported drink. Handle with care, ok? I'm getting doubts seeing upstairs, are these original? Oh... Original dude... We shall plan Singham 5 with you, ok? Move up... Yes. Hey, this guy's very greedy for money. Paying 5 more Lakhs, he looks to give away his DGP post to me. Yes, move on. Move. (HEY DEAR... LITTLE LORD KRISHNA... WHO HIT YOU...?) (HEY DEAR... LITTLE LORD KRISHNA... WHO HIT YOU...?) (MOM WAS HIT ME.) I withstood how much ever he hit dude, but he said a word at the end... Saying you're Pushpa's husband. Damn... I felt like dying for that... MLA hasn't met Sadasivam and didn't give the money. Then what about that 10 Lakhs? Hey, I'm feeling to have lost my prestige and are you feeling for that 10 Lakhs? All from a tailor to Police know about Pushpa. How did I miss dude? Shall we say Vasanthi about what really happened? She'd hit with her slipper. You gave the offer to hit with slipper, if you don't bring Sadasivam, right? It was you getting me trapped saying Sadasivam is coming to hospital, right? Hey, no use to fight in between us. Arrange that 10 Lakhs if you can or arrange Sadasivam at hospital. Who ordered for Brandy? Brandy is needed to get down hits from Police. How do you know that these are by the Police? I can just see and say which are the hits by Police and which are from wife. How? I wished to be a Police from childhood. Then what is this? I later came to know that just dreams are not enough to be a Police but also need education. Will you be the Police tomorrow in the morning? Do you have any objection if I become right today? Why'd you come in auto? This is high for what you gave. I even fixed the red light. Ok, say something and manage them. Okay. I use Government vehicle when I come on Government work and use private vehicle when on private work. Red light is common. Are you in a confusion as I said the answer without asking? I'm of the same type. Come on, follow me. Come inside after five minutes. Come in... He is our MLA. Personality suited perfectly. What's his daily payment? He's original Original? Look, once she comes in say with confidence that her job is confirmed in department. Your duty is just to give the dialogue and I'll excel it. Ok, do it great. Okay. What's the scanning saying? Hey, this is Xray. Oh... I too know. I felt so as it was seen in reverse. Hello, give it here. Is it not open? Hit here, hit here and then here again. Yes, take it. Look dear, your job is confirmed in Police department. In Police department? Yes. Thank you Sir, I'll go to my Doctor and come back resigning my job Ok, proceed. It's not with her that you need to say that dialogue. I too know that... I just did a rehearsal. Nurse too believed me, means my performance is a hit, right? They'd give you a Nandi. Give me a tip even if they don't give me a Nandi. Hey, they are coming... Good morning Sir. Hello, good morning Prashanthi. How are you? My name is Vasanthi Sir. Vasanthi... Prashanthi... Yes. I tested whether you were alert or not. Our department is so... By the way, your job in Police department is confirmed Thank you Sir. Not for you madam, but for your daughter. Yes Sir, my daughter dreamt to be into Police department from her childhood. They can't be by just dreaming but should study hard. If not, they'd become bearers in the bar. Excuse me... Yes. Why are so many here? Is this a bar or an ICU? Don't insult the bar. We know how many will be in a bar and how... Come here... Looks like you are in drink. Have you taken with beer in Mansion house? You think I don't know that. You may have taken drink but... Hey... You had it, ok. But looks like you gave even to him and is not getting up from the time we came. Ok, you please carry on, I will come again. No, don't come. Stay right there. You're so great Sir. How could you find it out like that? Experience! I served for 25 years and can't I find out this much? You served? I mean, he says to have served Police department from 25 years. You start now, you should go to the bar, right? Yes, for riding. Yes, didn't inform the owner too. What owner? That is... Owner means the Commissioner. Like we say bro for brother, he calls Commissioner as owner in shortcut. Sir, thank you so much Sir. Not to me but say thanks to Veerababu. He worked very hard for you If not what am I a Police Officer, my foot. Go on man. It's been a week since the blouse is given, when will you give? I'll give an hour sister, please wait. Hey Veerababu? What's the hurry? Is it Pushpa's matter? Whole village knows that Pushpa is a big matter. This is your matter My matter? It seems Police selections results are out today. Vasanthi and her morther are coming to the shop searching for you. Then, shall we close the shop? Oh, yeah. Veerababu, my blouse... Come after 2 months and I will stitch it. What till then? Stop wearing. You close it guys. We're caught, we're out. Knowing her name isn't there in results, our drama will be out. Mom, shop is closed. Have you too given blouses to this fellow? Come after two months. What's that? He has said the same to me and is sitting inside closing the shutter. Idiot.. You don't take any tension dude. We shall stay right here for a week closing the shutter. Our Jacket idiot will be out of Coma by then and then we shall give back their ten lakhs taking from him. You think we can't know where you are. What Sir, you did it all and are now hiding in here? Actually I don't anything madam. He did it all. You know madam? I know. Where are you going? You too have it. Give that here. Not that Vasanthi, I actually would go to MLA and... Thought she would bash us and why did she take out the sweet? I'm very happy Veerababu. Getting a Police job is tough and I got it in my own place. What, you got the job? It's all because of you... I won't forget your help in my life time. You can't forget even in next life knowing the real matter madam. DGP Sadasivam called us in the morning and said this good news instead of good morning. I didn't say you this as you would miss the thrill knowing it in advance. Really? Yeah. Absolutely, unfortunately... I'm joining in duty tomorrow and you should come for sure. Congrats Vasanthi Thank you. Look, it's like insulting me if you say thanks. Okay. All the best madam Thank you. Hey Suri, is this a dream or true? How did this miracle take place? Hey, didn't the public believe when KA Paul said he made Trump win? This too is the same. What if she comes to know the truth later? Hey, say her I love you by then, marry and have two children and they'll be there on safe side. Thanks for the good idea. Hey, I didn't give you idea for your thanks. Then? No idea when our Jacket fellow would come out. Vasanthi anyways has become an SI and thought to deal Pushpa's matter from this side. Hey, I won't delay anymore. I'll propose my love right tomorrow in a grand way. Hey, you're going to propose for the first time. Take my blessings. The guy winning in love would win in life and the guy losing in love would win over the world. Hey, Veerababu. Take off the autos... Two wheelers shouldn't be parked here. Maybe the buffalos would move but these wouldn't move madam. Stop, Is it enough.. Yes. What is this? You've kept the shop right on the road. You've come new here but we've been doing business here, from years madam. It was different till now and would be different from now. Vasanthi has come and you should vacate this place by tomorrow and leave I understood why you got anger madam. Here, take this. What is this? Bribe madam, this is normal for us. You bribe me? What's wrong madam? You got the job bribing 10 Lakhs. You should collect back with interest, right? Hey, what are you talking too much? Enough, take off your hands madam. You can get jobs by bribing and can't we do business? Madam, all are watching us. Move madam. Goddess of Justice is come to save the law! Go... You can get jobs by bribing and can't we do business? Take the vehicle directly to SP office. Ok Madam. SP sir is in meeting with DGP Sadasivam Sir, madam. Is even DGP Sadasivam right there? Very good. I'll throw my resignation letter right over his face. What, will you resign job? Who said I gave you the posting taking bribe? All are aware that DGP Sadasivam is loyal. You didn't get the job because of bribe or recommendation. It has come because of your merit. Someone cheated your mom and looted the money. Find out who he is and show the power of Police uniform. Oh, you! We were tensed thinking terrorists attacked on the station. What's this mess? I came to propose your madam. Hey... Sir. You guys are stay right here. I will scream loud once she says yes to me inside. Immediately you play the band to pierce the sound through the ears. We'll play such that your screams can't be heard out Sir. You'll see it. Even AR Rehman wouldn't say so confidently. Good. Thank you Sir... Wow, what a style. Not left right but it's right is right (I'M A LOVER ALSO, FIGHTER ALSO...) My dear friendly Police, today is valentines day for me. So, ask for whatever you need. Veerababu... Promotion for me I'll inform MLA and get you promoted as Home guard, Ok? Home guard? Yes. That isn't a promotion but the demotion. Some motion... Ok, is DSP fine. Brother Yes. Are offers only for the Police and none for us, the prisoners? What have you done bro? I broke one guy's head bro. Oh, that's all? It's cheap I'll do one thing I'll make them a murder case on you and they would transfer you to Tihar jail. Your level will go up. Ok? Yes, where is my darling? Madam went out on duty, wait here. You think, I came here as I was idle? Still, what's me waiting for her? She must wait for me in future after we get married. Hello. Hello Vaasu, I got to meet you urgently I too should meet you urgently, if you say your whereabouts, I'll come and meet you urgently. Where else would I be, in our station. It'd be comfortable, stay right there. I'll come right away. I won't leave till you come I won't let you leave at all, after I come. I am waiting. (HEY GOLDEN CHICK...) What man, driving with eyes closed? This is Police vehicle man. What if Police vehicle? Aren't the eggs broken when dashed? Boss, why mess? They will give money... Hey no money nothing, leave... Madam, hello madam... Pay 5000 at the rate of 5 each for 100 eggs 500 enough for 100 eggs, sir. We too know it's 500 and who'd give the tips? Will your driver give? Madam, have you become Police madam? Hey... Hello madam... Come on bring him. Hey, move in... Your madam and I'll go here for Honeymoon. We go here Into the Seas? Welcome Vasanthi, welcome. I've been waiting eagerly for you to come. I'm coming to you with 100 sticks. Good joke. Sense of humor is gone high in you after becoming a Police officer. Huh, who's he? Is he a terrorist? Congrats, did you catch such a big criminal just on the second day of your duty? Still, his body language says he isn't a criminal but a supplier. Like a guy supplying beers at bar, right? Exactly... Leave about this fellow. How much will DGP Sadasivam take for posting? That is... He takes 20 to 25 Lakhs for all. He took 10 for you as I requested in special. Yes! I brought him to station for saying thanks. Is it? Closed... Finished... You're trapped Veerababu. Who's this fellow looking just like our DGP Sir? Hey, don't overact Then, ok. When I was taking eggs to bar, madam caught me like a duck. You rascal... Call from a celebrity, I'll just be back. Stop, who is that celebrity? He's like Bigg Boss. He won't be seen but just heard. Then make us listen. What dude, have my blessings worked out? Did you say, I love you to Vasanthi? If she overacts, take her into a lockup without prisoners and then... give lip lock. Oh no..Hey... She'd then be just behind you like a Constable behind SI. You idiot... Hey... I spoke a deal with that Gudumba Govindam. He's saying to give one Lakh per month if he's given permission to prepare Gudumba. We three would get 33 each, if you settle the deal talking to your lover. Ask that idiot to come here first. Will you kill? I'd never say what I'll be doing? So, you'll say after killing? Why're you silent dude? Is anybody beside you? Say him to come. None is here. You come to the Police station and we shall directly talk. That is better. He's coming and I'll leave. Where'll you go? Idiot, why do you fall on me? Get up. Oh no... No... Hey, Sir is screaming and play the band now. Vasanthi, listen please. Listen to me I'm saying no, please stop... Oh no... No... Arrangements are great from our guy. Idiot has even a music taste. Hair is shabby and even the shirt is with folds. Did you finish first night already? Yeah... My guy would've already explained you the deal. Look, though we're going to do illegal business we should have a clarity between us. Do they give shake hand even like this? Why did she hit so dude? Is this why we made her a Police taking so much risk? Look, I'll call that DG Sadasivam right away and dismissed you. Cal him, come on call him. You say such a big man as rascal. You're gone now. You're out.. Cut it dude. Why's he cutting the call? I think he's in a meeting. He'll call back looking at the missed call. No problem call again I will I will call again and again. It is the last for you in this dress. If you have any selfies to take, do it right away (PHONE RINGING...) What, why is the ring coming from behind? Oh, is our DGP Sadasivam Sir right here? Make me dismiss. Come on, I said for fun and why do you take it so seriously? Bro, did she hit? I expected you'd get hit right that day when you overacted. Ok, I'll come and meet when my time is good. Oh no, she's killing me. What rascal, why're you screaming even before I hit? As I may not have the energy after getting hit. You... Oh no... Oh no... Enough of that hitting, stop it. I said stop it. Get my 10 Lakhs immediately. Madam, arrange even for my Ten thousand. Get out idiot Ok madam. Money isn't coming even from ATM and how'll you get money asking penniless like us? If you don't give my money in 24 hours, I'll take off your clothes and make you roam on streets in under garments I'm safe then why...? I won't wear under garments You... Oh No... Why do you hit right there when I said didn't wear under garment? Hello... What, did MLA gain consciousness? Is MLA regained consciousness? Is Jacket back to consciousness? Hey, it seems MLA is back to consciousness. Is it. It seems MLA is back to consciousness. Oh no... Stop it I say. Not in 24 but in 24 hours I'll get your money and throw on your face. Well said. You said great like the Telugu film hero. You are under dismissed Be ready packing your luggage I'm waiting I'm coming soon and nearby theaters. Hey, stop idiot. Hey, play the band now guys... Silly... silly..Silly fellows... funny... funny..funnyy fellows... Silly... silly..Silly fellows... (CHOTA BHEEM... CHOTA BHEEM...) (CHOTA BHEEM... CHOTA BHEEM...) Brother. Brother, are you good? Thank God. You know how happy am I seeing you so? I was thinking to enter Coma myself and talk to you, brother. That Pushpa came to my house and is asking to be a family. I couldn't bear that and... Oh no... See bro, you listening are unable to bear and how much should I feel bad? Hey, great... ( A SMALL TWIST IN THE STORY...) Why does he say so dude? Hey, say the real matter. Bro, you should come immediately and make Pushpa sign on these papers. Who is Pushpa? Who is Pushpa...!? You are the only man asking who is Pushpa, brother. Hey, I'm not knowing whether to laugh or to cry. You wait dude... Brother, you took 10 Lakh saying to get Police job for Vasnthi, right brother? Who is Vasanthi? Daughter of that hotel lady, brother. Who are you uncle? Uncle...? Why does he call me uncle, sister in law? What to say Veerababu? Crying from the morning, who is this aunty, uncle? Am I an auntie? Who are you, aunty? No, he's saying me aunty. Control sister in law. Hello, my dear boy, how are you? Doctor Sir, what's wrong with my husband? Before you listen to what I say... Don't say like make your heart strong, kidneys soft etc., Say what's wrong. His head had a strong wound in the accident and there was a small damage to his brain. And MLA sir is gone back to his 10 years of age. And MLA sir is gone back to his 10 years of age. From his recent reactions, I thought he's into Amnesia. This situation is very rare about one in a crore. He's lost 40 years and gone back to 10 years of age. Will it take 40 more years for him to come back to the present? That means... Should I be Pushpa's husband till then? Are you happy now? Come on, stay calm dude. Doctor Sir, how long will it take for my husband to get a cure from this madness? No, this isn't madness but just the memory loss. What if we take to Kerala? Are tours and honeymoon needed now? Not for that Doctor but to get Ayurvedic treatment. No, then my treatment? We've seen it right? Yes, take him and see. He'll then lose the balance of his mind and goes to his 3 or 4 years of age. If it goes so, shall I forget about my divorce matter and change his diapers? Not just that, you'll have to carry him daily. Enough, give it. Come with me, I'll write all tests available and you can get them done. Auntie, please carry me. Oh God. Sister in law... I'm crying as my life is ruined and are you licking the lollypop? Dear, you're coming from, inside right? Is MLA sir back to consciousness? What just conscious, he is jumping. Wow... Oh no. What's this man, you poured tomato sauce like a kid in your ears? Wow, I thought you'd say it blood. You identified greatly. Dear, how do I talk with brother? Grab his lollypop and then he'll answer correctly. Hey, take this point. Thank you (RINGA RINGA ROSES, POCKETFUL OF ROSES...) (RINGA RINGA ROSES, POCKETFUL OF ROSES...) What's he licking a lollypop like a mad fellow? Nothing bro, maybe his taste buds are down as he was in Coma from a longtime. I think Doctor said to lick and he is licking. Ok, ask about the matter first. Hey Jacket macho, where did that Minister hide money? (CUTE BABY PARROT...) Yes, it seems at our shop owner Chilakamma... What next...? Did your mom hit and have you been to the garden? Oh no, it seems her mom hit, and she went to garden. Ok, next... Did you bring the fruit and hide in the shelf? Bro, it seems she kept it in the shelf at the garden. Ok, next... Did you swallow it? Oh God, it seems she swallowed 500 crores. Oh no... Idiot, are you translating Andhra Pradesh Telugu to Telangana Telugu? He is singing rhymes. Yes. Cutie baby parrot... Snatch that... come on pull that lollypop. Are you overacting rascal? Say where did you hide it? Say, where did you hide that money? Oh no... Stop it now. Hey ghost, it seems Jacket is out from Coma right? He asked for you immediately after coming out of Coma, brother. Really? Yes. Why? No idea why bro, but he'd say in your ears if you ask him. Why'd you pour tomato sauce on your ears. Oh, you too felt so? Nothing, they said in YouTube that hairs in and out of ears are gone with tomato sauce. Why all those for you bro? MLA is waiting for you, go. Come on dude, come Coming. Bro, don't pull out that lollypop from his mouth by mistake. To hell with that idiot... He's said so means there's something in that lollypop. Correct brother. Abhijeet Brother. You think that Jacket fellow is really gone mad? Bro, it's like you are gone mad thinking that fellow is mad. Confirmed? What if not? That rascal is playing drama as mad looting 500 crores. Oh no.. Hey... Brother... It's very difficult to make him say the truth in this hospital. Let's kidnap him this night. (RAIN, RANI GO AWAY...) What Mr. Jacket, how are you? That Minister position is mine, if you hadn't come out of Coma. (NOT JUST THE SEAT BUT WON'T LET YOU CROSS EVEN THE ASSEMBLY GATE...) Wow great... Uncle said it great right? He's still not lost his fun. Hey, pull that lollypop first... Oh no... Hey, that Jacket guy is playing some dramas. Get him tonight by kidnapping. Ok brother. Cheers... Cheers. Hey, Vasanthi is saying to hit us on the roads with under garments on our bodies. That Jacket is biting the ears. I'm not knowing what to do. Listen to me and run away to some Pakistan or Bangladesh and can come back after MLA is better. Is she any Arundhati or Sivagami to fear? Oh no, Police. Oh no, I didn't wear an under wear. Is she now hit me...? Hey, it's an Ambulance. Why are you laughing, guys? Ambulance comes if someone gets a heart attack, but you get a heart attack if Ambulance comes. They say to give a side when Ambulance comes and thus we gave a side. It's all from the top but fears to her from in. Not a fear but love. Fear exists where there is love. Mine is a fear to lose my loved ones. Life is a big headache... Life is a big headache... Love isn't a matter to be settled having a quarter. Life is a big headache... Life is a big headache... Baby twists the life into circles putting a ring to finger. Love is headache and having lover is a headache... Life with no love and lover is a further headache... It's headache with the girl and more with the marriage... Bachelor life is a further bigger headache. It's a headache helping and headache being selfish too. Headache can't be avoided if you have a head. Don't ask for a life without that, God gets a headache. Headache comes on to you once you are onto this earth. Headache won't leave you till you're out from this earth. Life is a big headache... Life is a big headache... Babe has tightened life like Income Tax people attacked over the house. Life is a big headache... Life is a big headache... Have we become alone in life like ATMs with no cash after demonetization? RGV has a headache with women associations. Hero fans have a headache from critics like Kathi. Astrologers have a headache with people like Gogineni. Headache becoming weak with Veeramachaneni diet. Released films have a headache with ratings. Headache can't be avoided if you have a head. Don't ask for a life without that, God gets a headache. Headache comes on to you once you are onto this earth. Headache won't leave you till you're out from this earth. Life is a big headache... Life is a big headache... Life is a big drama like the fight of Tamil brothers after Amma expired. Life is a big headache... Life is a big headache... Brain is gone to dirt like Lalu jailed getting into the grass scam. Center has a headache from the special status. State gets a headache taking the package. Headache with girls when Rakhi festival comes. Headache from Bhajrangdal when lovers day is here. Consoling tour pacifying after troubling is a big headache for me. Headache can't be avoided if you have a head. Don't ask for a life without that, God gets a headache. Headache comes on to you once you are onto this earth. Headache won't leave you till you're out from this earth. Is this real...! I thought it was a dream. Saying to return money in an hour, are you into drink and dance coming here? Where are my 10 lakhs? On the way. On the way? You'll have it bad. If I don't receive my money by tomorrow morning... Won't you take if we give in the night? Even if I'd be there to take, you won't be alive to give. I'll encounter you. Oh no, really? Confirmed. Hey, it'd be great insult dying in encounter, after leading such a great life. I have an idea to escape from her. I know dude. You'll handover me and escape, right? No dude, we shall kidnap brother. Why kidnap? Enough that he is discharged, right? Doctors won't agree in the present condition. Then kidnap is correct. The name of operation which we are doing now is... You called for the kidnap, but again saying it as an operation. Idiot, the name of the kidnap is operation Jacket. Come on, follow me. Hey, doctors who come for rounds will get doubt, if this bed is empty. So, I will sleep here in his place. You guys take him from here. I will come later. You are super, brother. First, take him from here. Oh god, how is he so heavy? Brother, you sleep now. Hey, wear face mask. Hey, somebody is coming. Good morning, doctor. Good night, doctor. Come. Did you get the spray? Yes, I brought. Spray it. Idiot, I told you bring spray for unconsciousness. Hey, doctors who come for rounds will get doubt, if this bed is empty. You guys take him from here. I will sleep here in his place. I will come later. You are super, brother. Let's go. Hey, doctors coming. Good night, doctor. Mid night, doctor. Doctor, it may be higher dosage. His body requires it. He will sleep happily throughout the night, with this anaesthesia. Oh no.. Take rest my boy. Brother... Hey, he is in deep sleep. Help me, we shall take him from here. Hey, doctors coming, will put him in this room. Yes doctor, patient out of danger, it's a medical miracle. He is still sleeping, let's take him from here. Brother. Ok. Ok. Okay. I got to know today, I know it today, My beautiful dream has got the shape! That's like you... Oh...! Oh no... What I ask and what you did...? Show me his face before he dies. Sure. Hey, what's this. Why did you bring him? You drunk idiots! I will kill you all. Wait. I am going by car! By the way, what's your plan. I will tell you. Dear Janakiram, do you want lollipop or not? I want uncle. Did you kidnapped him to give lollipop? Wait. Then, what will you answer to Vasanthi. Vasanthi, it is the fact that I have taken 10 lacs from Veerababu. I couldn't give it to DGP, as I met with accident. I will give back your money, you don't mistake Veerababu. Veerababu loves you sincerely. With this, your problem will be solved. What about mine? Wait and see. Then, what will you answer to Pushpa. Pushpa, a small mistake is happened, when I did marriage event. For that reason, you should not trouble Suribabu. You immediately sign on divorce papers and leave his house. It is my order as MLA. How is it, uncle? Super, Jacket. I made him practice all these dialogues, throughout the night. Anyhow, Pushpa and Vasanthi are not aware about his mental condition. Yes. You solved our problems with just 2 lollipops. Alright, let's go to police station directly. Sure. I am tired of making him practice all dialogues, throughout the night. Take a nap. I will wake you up, once we reach police station. Uncle, there, cow and bull are loving each other. Hey, why did you drive to your house, instead to the police station. First, I should get rid of my problem. Hey, Pushpa, come out. Let's conclude it today. Hey, come out. Hey, come out. What's this? You might see lion on TV and movie, but you did not see directly, right. Watch now. What's this snoring? It's not snoring, it is a roar. You said, you will sign on divorce papers, if I bring MLA. See, here is MLA Mr. Jacket. Greetings, sir. Shut up and sign on these papers. Ok, give me those papers. Take it. That's the way you should behave. Did you see, her body language is changed. Hey, you wait. Brother, you please come. It seems, you said, you will not sign on divorce papers, until MLA brought here. Brother, being gentleman, give the judgment to separate them. She is agreed to sign, why is his performance required? You wait, how can we leave it as such. Brother, you tell her. Vasanthi. Vasanthi? It is the fact that I have taken 10 lacs from Veerababu. Not this, other one. I couldn't give it to DGP, as I met with accident. You spoiled it. I will give back your money, you don't mistake Veerababu. Veerababu loves you sincerely. Am I correct, uncle? You are telling Vasanthi's dialogue to Pushpa. Change the dialogue and tell her. I will tell only one dialogue for one lollipop. What? I will tell you a dialogue, if you give me a lollipop. Hey, get out. What is this, you can't do anything properly. It's my mistake to be with you. You are trying to cheat me with this mental. I will not sign. Wash those utensils and bring in. Seems, I should wash utensils. What did I do to you? Sweets! Sweets! Hey, sweets! Hey, sweets boy, wait. Sweets! Sweets! If you could stay calm for a minute, I would have taken sign on these papers. Sorry, dude. It's my mistake. Before going to Vasanthi, we shall practice it again. It is ok for you, if my life is spoiled. And, you want your life to be happy. Everything is happened, because of him. Hey, where is he? He is just a kid of 10 years. Yes, he is innocent, you are clever, in between I am cheated. Let's go search for him. (DISTINCT VOICES..)

They planned to attract MLA. I send him in the ambulance, safely. Now, everything is under my control. What is that in your control? Somebody fooled you, and kidnapped MLA in the duplicate ambulance.

Get down. What Vasanthi...? After all, for 10 lacs, will you encounter me, Vasanthi? No, somebody kidnapped MLA. What somebody kidnapped MLA...? I told you that, his mental condition is bad.

Devil, we both know each other for about 25years. He might have told me many things. Ask me clearly, what you want. That evening you went to hospital. You met my brother-in-law. What did my brother-in-law tell you in secret? That day early morning at 5 am, cock crowd. He started it again. Then, my wife! Daddy, I don't want what cock, dog and cat did. I want, what did my brother-in-law told you in secret. Listen, it's my hobby to remember anything in order. If you disturb in between, I can't. Hey, Abhijeet. Brother. What is this, he is telling it from starting? Let him say, is it any issue for us. He will be tired himself. You are dead! You did not catch him, you people caught by him. Ok daddy, you say it as you wish. That day early morning at 5am, cock has crowd. Then, my wife wakes me up after having bath and keeping flowers on her head. Jasmine flowers or what? Hey, stop it. You say.. That day early morning at 5am, cock has crowd. Oh my god, he initiated it again. Brother. Haa.. This is the only bad habit he has. If you disturb in between, when he is speaking in a flow. Now, you all know about his problem. So, hold on even if you are about to cough or sneeze. It's a matter of 500 crores. Can't you hold on for just half an hour. Thank you very much. Idiot shut up. You can start... That day early morning at 5am, cock has crowd. Then, my wife wakes me up after having bath and keeping flowers on her head. It was 8am by finishing my regular chores and bathing. (SNEEZES) Oh no.. Sorry bother. You people are killing me! He put the knife in my nose. Hey, do anyone in this world keep knife in the nose? It should be kept on the neck. Why did you put it in the nose? If you put this knife again in to the nose or any other hole, I will cut all your organs. Daddy, I apologise on behalf of everyone. Please start it again. That day early morning at 5am, cock has crowd. Then, my wife wakes me up after having bath and keeping flowers on her head. It was 8am by finishing my regular chores and bathing. Then, as I switched on the TV, 'beauty of dream world as has come in front of me to surprise'. After that... That is... After that... She has come from the heaven to the earth. My god! Brother, Suswagatham movie. Power star Pawan Kalyan's song. Damn...! Brother, please forgive me. My body shaken by listening to Power star's song. I beg you, please forgive me. Damn...! Hey, do you think I don't know songs. Khaidi No 150, Mr. Chiranjeevi's song, I can sing like, 'Darling let's do fight'. But I controlled on myself. One should have humanity. Why are you laughing? You can't make him to say it, even if you tried for entire life. How can I make him say it? Only one person can help you. Hey... Hey, it's a phone. Yes buddy, tell me. MLA is kidnapped. I know, I am searching for him. Buddy, I am also... Hey, don't disturb me. He disconnected the call. Try again. I shouldn't attend his call until I find MLA, I will switch off. This time, it is switched off. How to express love to her? Hey you. It is not my mistake. Driver applied a sudden break. Ask him. Don't apply the break even at speed breaker. Sure, madam. By the way, if sudden break is applied, you should have move forward. How did you come back and kiss her? Yes, it is a logic. Logic? Driver apply the sudden break again, we will check how is it happened. Again? Just shut up. It was 9am, by getting ready. My wife prepared Upma for me. At the same time, Veerababu came to my house. When I asked, are you in love with hotel owner's daughter? He tried to escape saying, nothing brother. When I forced him, he asked me to place a SI job for his lover and gave me 10lacs. I agreed and started from home. As soon as I come out, one person has come. Vehicle reached the station. The person is... It's me. Yes, It's me. Oh no... If you could give me just 5minutes on that day, Pushpa's matter would be settled. My god! What sin I did? Entire story would be finished in another minute, I would have saved. Do you have at least common sense? Give me your hand. Shut up. Turn this side. Turn this side. Shut up. Turn. If you open these two holes, I will close them completely. That day early morning at 5am, cock has crowd. Shit, it is punctured. Change it immediately. Am tensed that, MLA's life will be in risk, as we are getting late. Cool.. Cool.. Cool.. Mr. Langa Bangarubabu is the only enemy who wants to kill MLA. As MLA is not with, he is safe. You are telling everything as detective, but you couldn't tell who the kidnaper is. Wait. MLA met with accident when he went to meet the minister. Sir, at any cost MLA sir he should be fine and should go to the assembly. Yeah, I got him. Follow me. Where? I will tell you, first you remove the dress. What? Don't mistake me. I am asking you to come in civil dress. Oh ok. You get the vehicle ready and go to station. I will call you if needed. Ok. Ok madam. Hello... To help him, I took 10lacs and came out. Then, one person came. Ha, he is the one. See how he is sitting there. He came and requested me to settle the Pushpa's matter. Then Veerababu gave a correct suggestion as, 'minister is in serious condition, he must go to hospital immediately'. Idiot.. I came to hospital directly. By that time, it is 12.30pm. You were standing in front of me. You made fun of me. Do you remember? You told me to explain everything what is happened inside. You took inside, too. He was sleeping. He was given oxygen inhalation. Do you remember it or not? Do you know what you said, brother-in-law check who is it. Then, he slowly opened his eyes. Oh God...! He is born with the cylinder in stomach. Kill him. Please... Please... You could hold the cough and sneeze, why can't you hold this too. I could hold it form the start of the story, I couldn't hold it more. You should hold it, if you want 500 crores. Even a biggest story Ramayanam will be narrated in simple way. This is not that kind of a story. Please tell it in simple. He will not. That day early morning at 5am, cock cuckooed as Co Co in short cut. I said it right. Hey, what is this? Sorry. Sorry? It's crime if I do and it's a dream if you do, is it? I moved to front, as the sudden break is applied, but, why did you turn aside at the same time? That means, I know that I will apply a sudden break. What? Kiss should be wasted, right. Hey. Your brother-in-law slowly opened his eyes. We both were there in front of him. You were standing on the oxygen tube, by mistake. He couldn't catch the breath. He said, 'idiot, move away from the tube'. You moved away in a hurry. He told you to get out. While going out, you insisted to me to tell you everything, what happened there. Your brother-in-law asked me to come close to him. I went close and placed my ear near to his mouth. He said, I earned a lot of money but I couldn't earn the dignity. At the same time, you people opened doors. Pushpa, why did you disturb at the end? Is it fair kidnapping the groom? Why did you come here? Today is Sunday, new moon. Are you planning for occult activities? No, I am planning for the first night. First night? Shut all your mouths. First night. First night for you! No. For you, first night. For me? I mean, for both of us. Pushpa, how did you know that Suribabu is here? One of my fans is there in your group. God! Pushpa's fan is there in my group? Who is that? You... Pushpa's... Fan... Idiot, how can you cheat me? Brother, my luck, she came here herself. Please ask her to sign on divorce papers. So that, I will get rid of my problem. Hey devil, I need two minutes of time. No one can go out. Then, you go. No, I will turn aside, if you want. Then, We will turn back. We can also turn back. Pushpa, come here. What do you want, to sign on this file? Concealer or corporater? It's a small for post for this huge signature. Human illegal affairs minister, how is it? This looks fine. Come sign.. Fix it. Come sign.. Good, she learned to sign. Brother... Remove it. Speak out. How much ever precautions we take, one or the other way somebody is disturbing us. First tie him. What did brother-in-law tell you in secret? That day early morning at 5am, cock has crowd. Then, my wife wakes me up after having bath and keeping flowers on her head. It was 8am by finishing my regular chores and bathing. When I switched on the TV, beauty of dream world as has come in front of me to surprise. Fly... Fly... Fly... Death knell to you... I'll take your life easily... Fly... Fly... Fly... Death knell to you... I'll take your life easily... He asked me to place a SI job for his lover and gave me 10lacs. Sorry Mr. Rajamouli. I agreed and started from home. He said about 500crores money... Hey... Bruce Lee. Jackie Chan. Tiger shroff Tony Jaa. Vasanthi. Open the arm out! Your foot! If you would come a minute later, I would have given you a crore rupees. Hey, Devil, who is this? Pushpa? It's not Pushpa, open your eyes and check. Hey, Veerababu. Brother, you became normal. Are you alright now? He is alright, but these people became abnormal. Suri, are you here? You should have call me. You should have picked the call. Stop it. You all are under arrest, as you kidnapped MLA. You all are under arrest, as you kidnapped MLA. Wait. What do you want? I can make him answer that. Brother, the day when accident happened, I did not meet you at all. Veerababu, you came and met me while I was having breakfast. You gave me 10lacs to place a police job, for your lover. Do you understand? Sorry. Veerababu is nick name of honesty. He is right, he may cheat friends, but he will not cheat lover. God! Why did you come here? To solve your love problem or to solve my problem. You have given that 10lacs to Sadhasivam. I did not give him as he denied recommending, so I gave to contractor Gurunadham, to deal it other way. Your matter is clear. Brother, you did not meet minister at 12:30pm. I met him. I did not tell you about 500crores. Why not, he told me that, he kept that money at his old house which is located at Gandhinagar. Hey, Yes.. The lord has arrived. The earth has raised the umbrella, filled with stars of the sky. The lord has given. A promise sprouting wings of a new hope. The lord has arrived. The earth has raised the umbrella, filled with stars of the sky. The lord has given. A promise sprouting wings of a new hope. I am grateful to you. Come here. Brother. It is difficult, if they ask for percent from 500crores. So, kill them all. Brother, have you gone mad? Hey... Hey, how dare you calling a millionaire as mad? We are not yet sure, whether money is there in that place or not. We will kill them all, once we confirm. Super idea. Location shift. Sir, it is like haunting place. Yes, it belongs to the Devil from today. Come in. Hey, switch on that light. Hey Jacket, where is the money hidden by my brother in law? Cock that morning at 5 cuckooed... Oh no, I salute you Sir. Not all these... He dragged me into this Cock track 'and this brother in law shouldn't be let gone. What is this? Hey Abhijit Brother. Maybe my brother in law murdered somebody, put the dead body in this box and planned to trap us. This old man is troubling even after dying. To hell with him... Oh no... Brother What? Money bro, money Money? Rs.2000 notes... Will you be on that side or this side. 500 crores, for me... Hey Devil... Hey, your brother in law asked me to use this money for good deeds.
