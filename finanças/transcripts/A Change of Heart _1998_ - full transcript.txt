(BIRDS CHIRPING) (JIM GRUNTING) (ELAINE LAUGHS) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) JIM: Come on, Jess, pass it, pass it! (JIM LAUGHING) (ELAINE SCREAMING) Nice pass, Dad. Oh, your mother is cheating again. Bring it on, baby. (CHUCKLES) Oh, nice thing to say about your wife. (GROANS) Okay. You're right, Jess. Next time, take no prisoners. ELAINE: Oh, Sarah's ready. SARAH: I'm ready. I'm ready, come on, come on. Come on, I'll fix you a drink. See you guys later. Take it, Jess. Go! JESSE: Oh, yeah. Ooh... Go get it. No, get the ball. You get it. I'm not getting the ball. ELAINE: I wish we could've come up here later in the spring when the daffodils are blooming. JIM: We have daffodils in our backyard in the city. Oh, it's not the same. I think they're the most beautiful thing up here. (SIGHS) Oh, no, sweetheart. They're the second most beautiful thing up here. Nice recovery. Hmm. (SIGHS) Jim? Hmm? Stop thinking about work. Oh, I wasn't. I wasn't. I was wondering what this place is going to look like in 40 years. ELAINE: These mountains aren't going anywhere. You know, when you first showed me this place, I thought we'd never make the time to come up here, but you've made it very special for us. Thank you. You deserve something nice for that. Oh. Get in here. I'm freezing to death in this thing. (LAUGHING) Mmm. SARAH: Hey, give me the damn phone, all right? JESSE: I'm on the phone, okay? SARAH: Come on! Not tonight. (CHUCKLES) I always forget how thin these walls are. Oh, God, teenagers. (KIDS CONTINUE ARGUING) Best birth-control going. (CHUCKLES) Come on, guys, let's go! Oh, the new accountant starts tomorrow. Wow. That was quick. Well, Sally didn't give us much notice. Gail had to hire somebody over the phone. I hope he's not an ax murderer. Okay, guys. I was thinking, could I take some friends up to the cabin for the spring break? Sweetheart, your mom and I don't have any more time off till summer. Well, you guys don't have to come. (LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY) If anybody's going up to the cabin unchaperoned, it's going to be me and your dad. Why would you want to do that? (CHUCKLES) Figure that out. Oh, gross! (LAUGHS) Gross? Disgusting! Jess, as soon as we get unloaded, don't forget, you need to finish that paper. (SCOFFS) Whatever. Whatever, whatever! I love that word. It's a kid's way of saying "yes" when he really means "shut the hell up." SARAH: The tree fell! Oh, my God, look at this! Oh... (GASPS) Oh, God, Jim. Oh, my goodness. JESSE: Man, five feet the other way. Goodbye, house! Oh, no. I'll call somebody about it tomorrow. (HUMMING) Uh, Sarah's hogging our bathroom. I can come back. No, hey, come on. It's only a mirror. Please. (JIM CLEARS THROAT) Just checking out my technique, huh? Dad, I know how to shave. Okay. I'm having dinner over at Kelley's house on Friday night. How is Kelley? She's good, she's okay. I might be back kind of late. How late? Oh, late enough. I see. You guys taking precautions? Dad, I haven't even... Hey, hey, hey! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. (SIGHS) I wasn't prying. Don't be self-conscious about it, Jess. I mean, the first time's always a little ticklish. Dad, please. Hey, I'm just saying, my first time wasn't exactly a home run, okay? Oh, my God. The good news was that... (CLEARS THROAT) By the time I got into medical school, met your mom, I was ready. I can't believe I'm hearing this. (CHUCKLES) It's not exactly a family secret, you know. It's not like I slept around. Your mom was only my second. Well, there's a whole lot to be said for family secrets. Hmm. Is that why you didn't tell us about Boston University? What were you doing in my room? I wasn't. I wouldn't. Dean Anders called me. God! I mean, it's not every day your son gets accepted to your alma mater. Jess, Jesse, your mom and I are very proud of you. (DOOR SLAMS) (SIGHS) I told you to wait until he brought it up. Don't! (LAUGHS) After you, Mrs. Marshall. Thank you, Dr. Marshall. Here you go. This is yours. WOMAN: Hi, Elaine. Good morning, Dr. Marshall. Hi. Hi, Trish. Ah, good morning. These are for you and Sadler Health Services said these forms were not filled out correctly. Oh, and Jim, Dr. Wexler wanted to know why the Turner child was referred out to Portland Pediatrics. That was an administrative decision and Carl knows that. He can talk to me about it at the meeting this afternoon. Oh, gee, I love Mondays. Jim, Elaine. Hi, Gary. I thought I was going to see you last night. We didn't get back from the cabin till late, so... You want to have lunch later? Sure, yeah. LEWIS: Hey, welcome back from the wilds. Hi, Lewis. JIM: Morning. Look what I found in the parking lot. Oh! Hello, Joshua, how are you feeling? Oh, good. I missed you. Oh, you want candy, huh? (CHUCKLES) Candy is for after the exam. Candy after doctor. Exam in Room 3, please. Room 3, please. Okay? We're not seeing Dr. Marshall? Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Miller, maybe next week. Dr. Wexler is a bit curt, but he is a good doctor. I'll see you later, okay? Gail, you run the numbers. Can we really afford that increase in the research budget? Yeah. It'll be a bit of a stretch, but we can manage as long as Elaine lands those two grants. Oh, we'll know that in a couple of weeks. In the meantime, we've all got plenty to do. Jim gets to look for the deaf gene and the rest of us take up the slack. Oh, come on. Lewis, do you have a second? Seeing that old Josh Miller this morning, he is such a happy, normal kid. It reminded me of that Moroccan boy that Jim saw last week. He'd been misdiagnosed two times. One doctor thought that he was retarded. I just... Probably because he never had his hearing test. That's correct. Now we should be doing our own testing here. Now, Portland State has a two-year master's Audiology program at night. I thought about doing it before, and now that my kids are older, I'm thinking, why not? That's interesting. Jim has the lightest patient load in this institute, and now you're talking about taking time off for school. This has nothing to do with Jim. I don't recall saying anything about taking any time off... Elaine? Phone for you. Oh, Trish, please take a message. It's Jesse's school. Oh. Um... Yeah, excuse me. Oh... (GRUNTING) Jesse, we got to go to class. Are you coming? So boring. Hey, you want a game? Yeah, cool. Must've had a fight with his boyfriend. I don't want to have that fairy in my team. Well, you don't have to. Yo, what's up? I'm Jesse, man. Hey, I'm Trey. Well, looks like it's me and you, okay? Cool. Fall out. Get out! (GRUNTS) Hey, man, that was a foul! What, did I hit you? I didn't even notice. If you weren't a faggot, I'd punch your lights out. That's out of bounds, man. Yeah, well, this faggot would like you to try. I'm out. I'm sorry, man, you know. Yeah, that's okay. Jesse, we're going to be late for calculus. (HORN HONKING) Oh. Damn. Guys, I'll catch up with you, okay? Jesse, they said this wasn't the first time. Just because you've gotten into college doesn't mean you... Mom, I'm not messing up my grades. I'm on top of it. I don't need a lecture. What lecture? I said one sentence. Yeah, well, I heard all the other sentences waiting in the wings. Oh, you! (CHUCKLES) All right, you win that one. Just don't do it again. I promise. And he's cut his third period four times, and he's been late to class after lunch every day this month. Probably just senior-itis. ELAINE: Oh, I suppose so. It's hard to believe he's going to be at BU next year. Hmm. It's going to be awful quiet around here. You know, I've been thinking. Uh-oh! (CHUCKLES) Do you suppose that there'll be time for me to, uh... Well, I've been thinking about some night classes. You know, the Audiology program, the master's program over at Portland State? Yeah, that would be a good idea. I mean, at some point. But I just wonder about the timing. You know, with Jesse gone, it seems like a lot of change to lay on Sarah all at once. Oh, Jim, come on. I mean, you're home almost every night by 7:00. Yeah, well, I'm in my study half the night. I've got a stack of lab reports that are about to swallow my desk. I really ought to knock some of these out tonight. I know. That's what I should do. Gosh, dark gray or black? (SIGHS) Tough choice. (CLICKS TONGUE) (SIGHS) I don't want to spend another night listening to Li talk about their new boat. Oh, come on. It's her birthday. Humor her. (SIGHS) You go. I'm not going without you. Uh-uh. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) MAN: I don't even know the guy. Did you know... Well, anyway, we can't decide between using, um, maybe a mahogany, in my free time, and decorating the inside. Did I tell you I was doing this? A lot of time. We just can't decide on the colors. We're using maybe a mauve and a teal, or maybe... Come on. No. Come on. You're the last guy to beat me on my own table. You know, I'm really not up for it. You okay? Yeah, I'm just not feeling very energetic tonight. Hey, why don't you come out on the boat with us next Sunday? Get a little fresh air. I don't think I'm going to be free next weekend. Gary. (CHUCKLES) Everything's fine. Lewis thinks you'd make a great audiologist. He does? Nice. Mmm. (SCOFFS) I hate to admit that Carl Wexler might be right about something, but I don't have the time. Elaine, make time. This is for you. Well, in my case "you" as in "singular." Oh, here we go again. You know, you might ask yourself exactly when, "Honey, can you help out around the office?" turned into a 15-year career. Gail, I know what you're saying. I married a man with a cause and I've gotten way more out of it than I ever gave up. So sue me. (SIGHS) I need to go home. We haven't even cut the cake yet. Oh, I've got a terrible headache. (SIGHS) Gail, could you give her a ride home? Please give Loni my apologies. Okay, I guess. Bye. You know what I think? I think... I think you're too afraid to go back out into the world. Afraid it might be too much work. Sweetie, real life's easy. It's marriage that takes all the work. He's that salesman from Cropper & Company. ELAINE: He seems to be interested in Loni's daughter. She's only about two years older than Sarah. Men never think anyone's too young for them. You know what really gets me about getting older? Do I want to know this? It's not that men don't find you sexually attractive, it's that... They just don't find you. You become invisible. You just become sexually invisible. Huh! Well, there's something to look forward to. Hmm. Hi, Gail. Daniel! Oh, I love, uh, Gorgonzola. Oh, excuse me. Uh, Daniel, I'd like you to meet Elaine Marshall, Administrative Director of the institute. Hi. How do you do? Hi. I've started introducing myself to you many times, but you're always so busy. Oh, that's me. (CHUCKLES) Well, it's, um... Very nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you, too. (SIGHS) What? I was just admiring my Gorgonzola. Hmm. Hey. Hi. How was the party? Awesome. Don't get crumbs in your bed. Hey, somebody's got to feed the dust mites. Funny. That was funny. I'll see you as soon as I can. Oh, maybe tomorrow. Okay. Hi. Hi. How was the rest of the party? Oh, you know. (CHUCKLES) How's your headache? It's better, thank you. Who was that on the phone? A patient. Well, who was it? You're not on call tonight. (SIGHS) It was a referral, you know. Somebody gave him my home number. It's 11:00. You're too nice. Oh, no, honey, don't stop. That's great! Oh, bye, Mom. You look great. No, do it again. Come on. All right. When I was in college, I used to think of it as ballet. Ballet? Yeah. Cool, huh? Yeah! Yeah, for an old lady, it's pretty cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. (CHUCKLES) Maybe I can come over to your class, give a few pointers, huh? (CHUCKLES) Oh, my God. Wear matching leotards. Have you completely lost your mind? You can tell people I'm your big sister. Don't you know this much fear can stunt my growth? I've got to meet that boy, Spencer. Is that his name? I am not hearing this. I'm not hearing this. Spencer? I'm not... Mmm, I'm not hearing this! Eat your breakfast. How do you do, Spencer? Nice to meet you. Mmm-hmm. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Excuse me, could I call you right back? Okay, thank you. Where is he? Well, he's where he's been this time of day for the past six months. There can't be that many books in the damn library. Well, Carl, tell you what. If there's a problem with this afternoon's schedule, why don't you let me know, and I'll take a look in Jim's book and I'll see what we can work out. I am triple-booked now between 3:00 and 4:00 because he told Mrs. Miller she could come in this afternoon without an appointment, which would be fine with me if he was here to deal with it. Well, don't I always fix these things? (SIGHS) Is this an "organize this" thing? Trish, I'm going right past the lab on my way back, so why don't I pick up those reports? Okay. Oh. Please tell Jim I put a new appointment for this afternoon in his book. Sure. Thanks. Vista Inn. Coffee's here. (SIGHS) What... (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) I'm sorry. (SHAKILY) Don't. Don't. I didn't mean for you to find out this way. No, I can't... I can't. Go away. I was going to tell you about it. Please, I don't... I don't know who you are. Elaine, we need to talk. Please. Oh, God... (SOBBING) How long has this been going on? How many? What are you? I don't believe this. I was going to do this a different way. Different way? Different way? Yes. Which part did you want to do different? The part where I saw you? Oh, God. I'm such a fool! Please. Oh, God. I'm such a fool. You know that I would never intentionally hurt you. Elaine, please, listen to me. (CRYING) I'm not trying to justify this. I'm just trying to understand myself, everything. (STAMMERING) What about me? What about AIDS? I've been careful. Oh, God, this isn't happening. Elaine, please, please. Don't touch me, please, please! Get away from me! Don't you even look at me! Don't! Just go. (SOBBING) Go away. Elaine... Go! Get out! Get out. Go! (DOOR OPENS) Oh, I'm starving. Can we order in? We can go out. Mom, let's go out. I don't want to go out. (STAMMERS) I'm not feeling well. Oh, yes, ordering in. I'll get the menus. I'll get Dad. Is he in the study? No, um... He's working late tonight. Good. That means we can order pizza. Oh, pizza. I'm going to go lie down. You kids use the credit card. I've never seen her like that before. It was really frightening. Honestly, Jim, what did you expect? Honestly, I didn't think it through. Were you ever planning on telling her? Certainly not this way. But you don't write a room number on your calendar and act shocked when your wife finds us. No! No, you don't! (SIGHS) Oh, God. You know what the most confusing thing about this is? When I decided to admit to myself that I was gay, I just assumed that that would take the place of my relationship with Elaine, but it didn't. She's still right there where she's always been. My feelings for her haven't changed a bit. What about your feelings for me? How did it get so complicated? (SIGHS) Jim, what's done is done, you know. The pain has already been handed out. And now you have to decide where you want it all to land. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) (DOOR OPENS) Where's the paper? I don't know. I thought I'd make pancakes. No, it's okay. SARAH: I want pancakes. Could you help me get the buttermilk and the eggs, please? Uh, never mind if I have to help. Sarah, do you know where the paper is? No. Where you going? To talk to Dad. No, no. Just finish your cereal in the kitchen. You know I don't like you eating upstairs. Since when? (CHAINSAW WHIRRING) Oh, man, check that out. Dad's pulling a Paul Bunyan. (WHIRRING CONTINUES) You kids get ready for school. I need to speak to your father. What about the pancakes? Just do it. (SIGHS) You must hate me... I want to talk to you. You go first. Who is he? His name's Phil. He's the first man I've ever been with. Are you leaving me? You know, for years before I met you, I knew I had these feelings. All the way back to my first year in high school, but I didn't know what to do about them. And then I met you and it seemed for a very long time it'd been decided for me. I fell in love with you. I'm asking you. Elaine, I swear to you, it's the truth. I've always loved you. This other... It just never went away. Are you leaving me? Did you hear anything I just said? If you're leaving, I don't care about any of that. I don't believe that, Elaine. Doesn't matter what you believe. This just isn't going to happen. You tell me there's an explanation. You tell me it's over. You tell me something, Jim. Well, I thought you'd want me out of the house. I don't know what to do about the kids. Nothing. You are doing absolutely nothing about the kids. We have 20 years together. You are not walking out on them. We are not going down that road. (DOOR SLAMS) Want some tea? No, thanks. (DOOR CLOSES) There you are. Hi. What's the big crisis? What crisis? Your door has been shut for the past three hours. Elaine? Jim! Jim! Oh, don't do this, Elaine, please, it's just going to make us both crazy. I have to know. I just can't keep sitting in there wondering. It's going to make me crazy. Jim, I mean, who were you thinking of when you made love to me? What was I to you? Not now, please. Not here. I'm asking you not to go. I'm just going to the library. (SCOFFS) Elaine. I understand how terrible this is for you, but what am I supposed to do? I mean, I can't report in every time I walk out the door. Fine. Fine. Account for every minute of my day. How does that make it better for you? Does it change who I am? Just might make it possible for me to get through the day, that's all. I have to get through the day, too. Just... Don't throw it in my face, okay? Don't make me sit in there watch you leave. (SOBBING) Because I don't think I can take that. I won't sleep with him while we're working this out. What about our friends? I'll be discreet. (DOORBELL RINGS) SARAH: Mom, can you get that? I'll be down in a minute. What's up? You must be Spencer. Uh, yes, ma'am. Is Sarah ready? Come in. How long have you been driving? Uh, since I was a kid. I'd like your parents' phone number. Okay. I'd also like to know where you're going. Are you going alone? Actually, Spencer, if you could just leave us a thumbprint here on this glass, (SCOFFS) we'll run it through the FBI computer. Hi, I'm Sarah's dad. Well, actually, I thought I'd take her down to Mexico to get hitched. (CHUCKLES) Is there some reason you don't want me to know where you're going? Mom. What are you doing? We're going to go see a movie. Would you chill out? Be home by 10:00. The movie won't even be over by 10:00. By... 11:00. Drive safely, don't drink. Thanks, Dad. Go on, guys. Have fun. Bye. (SIGHS) What the hell was that about? She can't just go out and not tell me where she's going. Don't be dumping this on Sarah. We've always been able to trust her. Yeah, well, trust is a little less durable these days. You know, I did make dinner tonight. Thank you, but I've eaten. Well, you have to call me. What am I supposed to tell the kids when they ask where you are? Am I supposed to make something up? You have put me in an impossible situation with the kids. No, you have put us in it. I... I know the kids have to be told at some point. You just have to give me a little more time to work through this. Remember all that garbage I told you about how easy it was to decide to not to go back to graduate school? Oh, forget it. Is that what you guys were arguing about? We weren't arguing. Oh, yes, we were. Last few days, felt like a shrill bitch from hell and I don't like it. I think you really need some time to yourself. Whatever. I think I understand why Jesse likes that word so much. Stop being so cynical. 'Cause first of all, that's my department, and second, Jim always gives in to you. He's just a little distracted right now. Fix him a nice dinner. No, the way to a man's heart isn't through his stomach. You start below the belt and work your way up. Elaine... Problem is, you get to his heart, and it's closed. Jim's got you pissed off about something, right? I'd say you sound like a woman who just caught her husband having an affair. (SOBBING) Oh, my God. Oh, Gail! He did love you. (SIGHS) How do you know that? He still does. How can you say that? Because it's obvious. I've known you for almost 20 years. You're like my ideal of love, the two of you. Geez, Gail, no wonder you're divorced. (SNIFFLES) He can love you, really. And he does. And he can still be driven to do this other thing. Sleep with a man, Gail? Fall in love with a man? It's not just your average other thing. Would you rather the other thing where a 25-year-old aerobics instructor with inflated breasts... I mean, really, he hasn't exactly replaced you, has he? You must have given me way too much wine way too early in the day, because the idea that even makes any sense at all is vastly frightening. (SNIFFLES) Have you ever thought about it? You know... Two guys, you know... Say it, Elaine. If you can't get the words out of your mouth, you can't begin to deal with it. Jim... You know... Two men doing it. I can't picture it. I don't process visually. (CHUCKLES) Uh... (LAUGHS) I need some fortification. My relationship with Jim has always been from the neck up... (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh, God. I know that he's going through hell, too. There's a part of me that wishes I could fix it for him. Oh, sweetie. (DOOR CLOSES) I didn't call. Oh, sorry. Take this. No, no, please sit. I can... (SIGHS) The kids out? They're at the game. Right. I forgot. (GROANS) (DISHES CLATTERING) It's been a long time since the two of us have eaten in the dining room. I just heated up some leftovers. Thank you. Mmm. This is good. Mmm. Could you pass the pepper? Mmm. (SIGHS) (WATER RUNNING) (EXHALES) (BELL CHIMES) Hey. (EXHALES) Pretty bad, huh? Well, we've, uh... We've settled into this... This awful no man's land. It's like dying one cell at a time. Well, I've had some time on my hands and I've been looking around and I have gotten some good advice, I think. Does it have anything to do with a handgun? (SIGHS) Don't even joke about that. (CHUCKLES) I have made an interesting discovery, okay? This group is called GAMMA. Gay and Married Men's Association. They meet every Tuesday night at the Shelby Rec. Center. Look, I understand that you can't really do this with me, at least not yet. But you don't have to do this alone. MAN: Well, I'm camped out in the spare room with my two sons. My wife is sleeping in our daughter's room. She doesn't even want to look at our old bed. On Saturdays, a bunch of us guys get together and play touch football. Last week, we were choosing up sides and somebody says, "It's the usual. Two hands below the waist." And my son turns to me and says, "That ought to be fun for you, Dad." (ALL LAUGH) Look, jokes aren't bad. My wife isn't laughing. MAN: What about your wife, Jim? I thought, um... I thought I'd just listen this time. These meetings have no guidelines or restrictions. But we do have one rule, Jim. No hiding. Talk to us. My wife and I, we made love. I thought maybe... it was a big mistake. What's it been like since? I had a hard time even looking at Phil or myself in the mirror, for that matter. I have loved Elaine for half my life. She and kids mean everything to me. Everything. How are your kids taking it? You have told them? (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Sarah? Sarah? (GUITAR PLAYING) (KNOCKING) Jess, you got a minute? JESSE: Yeah. Sit down. (SIGHS) I'm not going to patronize you by suggesting that you haven't noticed that something's been going on lately between your mom and me. Are you guys getting a divorce? Why do you say that? You know, I'm, like, a minority at school, you know, kids with both parents at home. It's that bad? Pretty much. I can deal with it. Well, it's more complicated than that. I'm gay. (LAUGHS) Yeah, right. That's a good one, Dad. It's true, Jesse. You're my son, you deserve to know. (SIGHS) Look, if you're angry, if you're grossed out, I'll understand, but I have to know. Know what? How you feel. So you're gay, you know, no big deal. It's not against the law or anything. No, no, Jess, we have to talk about this. Yeah, we just did, okay? Jess, Jess, please. (SIGHS) Jesse? (DOOR OPENS) Jesse, it's a school night! (DOOR SLAMS) (EXHALES) What's wrong with Jesse? Oh, he'll be okay. You told him? (SIGHS) Isn't any of this my business? Didn't it occur to you to tell me something, to warn me? You would've talked me out of it. Of course I would have, you bastard. Did it make you feel better, huh? Are you okay? God, I hope so. When are you gonna think about someone other than yourself? "I have these feelings." God, it's pathetic! To hell with your feelings, Jim! Act like a man if you are one! I am a man, Elaine. I am a man! I am a man! It was a lie! Everything for the past 20 years has been a lie! No, everything for the last two weeks has been a lie, and I'm through with it! I am not lying anymore. This house, my future, the children, it's all a lie! Listen, listen. Listen to me! I am sick and tired of being made to feel like a criminal. (CRYING) I didn't choose to be what I am, but I am, I am gay, Elaine. I am gay! Stop it. Oh, God. (ELAINE SOBBING) JIM: Oh, my God. Sarah, no. Don't you come near... You stay away! (WAILING) Oh, baby! Oh, baby! Honey, I'm sorry! Oh, God. ELAINE: I'm so sorry! Jesse... It's okay. (ZIPS PANTS) It's really okay. I understand. It's really cold. Come here. Hold me. Get dressed. I'm taking you home. (ENGINE STARTS) (SNIFFLES) I'll die if anybody finds out. I know, honey. I understand, believe me. Why does he have to be gay now? Didn't just happened now. (SNIFFLES) I don't understand. It's very hard, baby. But we have to figure it out because he's still your dad. And... As hard as this is gonna be, you have to keep remembering that he loves you. How could he do this to us? (INAUDIBLE) Where have you been? Out. Oh, don't worry, Mom, I mean "out" as in "out of doors." Oh, Jesse. Jesse? Are you all right? (SCOFFS) Never better. Oh, Elaine, I am so sorry. I just can't imagine what you must be going through. Oh, please, Loni... Of course, I just had to tell you that we're there for you. If there is anything I can do... It's, uh, just so unbelievable. (DOOR OPENS) I think the news is out. I was expecting it, just not so soon. Jim slept on the Morgans' couch last night. Huh, I see. That must've made for interesting breakfast chitchat. Thought I'd find you in here. ELAINE: Hi, Carl. He left already. That's not acceptable. Well, I won't be taking care of those sort of things for Jim anymore. Why the hell not? Because I just found out Jim's gay and sleeping with another man. So it just doesn't seem like the right thing to do. Oh, thanks very much for that. Maybe I should just go straight to Franklin. You can go straight to somewhere, Carl, that'd be just fine. That was amazing. Uh... Do you really think it was a good idea? I don't know. Doesn't matter, Gail, because I'm leaving. I'm not coming back. Today? Not ever. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Elaine? Elaine! Elaine! (DOOR OPENS) Why aren't you at work? You're asking? Lewis gave me the day off. ELAINE: Why did Lewis give you the day off when you're already short-handed? Because he, like I, realized this is a temporary hiccup you're having. An understandable one, but temporary, nonetheless. And? And I am here to enforce the temporary aspect. Oh, God, why do I think that no amount of pleading is going to send you away? Because you're a very shrewd judge of character. Mmm. Listen, Elaine, I understand your need for a good, old-fashioned, rock-bottom sulk. So, I'm giving you 24 hours. But you're not going to make it a way of life. Not you. You're too smart, attractive and sexy. Oh, yeah, I turned my husband gay. Oh, come on, you know it doesn't work that way. I didn't know it worked this way. My gay friends were always gay. You know Keith and Robert? (SCOFFS) Their marriage is going to outlast mine. You know, if Jim had said that he was torn between the two of us, at least I could still feel sexy. You are. You turn heads. (SCOFFS) I know you don't think so now, but... Name one. Name one. Daniel Bryan. Oh, please, the Gorgonzola guy? (LAUGHS) You remembered his name. Oh, well, sure. He asked about you. Really? Yeah, my hand to God. (LAUGHS) I told him you were separated, he wanted to call. Gail! I'm not ready to start dating. It's not dating. It's dinner. You gotta eat. What would Jim think? I am not dignifying that. Let him worry about it. All right, all right. All right. It just occurred to me, he walked out straight into this whole huge support group. (CHUCKLES) Where's my support? You're looking at her. I know. I'm sorry. Thanks. Yeah, that's better. By the way, Lewis said he wants you to take the rest of the week, but he expects you bright and early Monday. (CHUCKLES) He's a dear man. You know, Gary Morgan has taken on almost as many patients as you have. He's never complained. He's never had Elaine Marshall tell him to go to hell, either. LEWIS: Elaine said that? It doesn't matter if she said exactly that. You can't deny their personal mess is affecting this institute. Carl, I know what you're driving at, and I find it offensive. Let's not put our heads in the sand, Lewis. No matter how liberal we may or may not be, the institute cannot afford to be associated in people's minds... With what, exactly? Let's not be naive. As chairman of the board, I have to take this very seriously. And if we decide to act, we will expect your full support. (SIGHS) Oh, no. (CLATTERING) (SIGHS) (EXHALES) Like she was... She could actually be his mother. (LAUGHING) They were just from different worlds, you know. Thank you. Thank you. So the way I looked at it, if I called too soon, you could just say no, and if I called too late... Well, and then Gail gave me your number, so... (LAUGHS) But you said yes, so... Well, dinner is dinner, right? And dinner is lovely. I had a very nice time. Yeah, me, too. Look, I'd call you right away, I mean, that's my instinct, but, uh... I mean, you gotta tell me. (KISSES) I'm sorry. (CLEARS THROAT) No, I'm sorry. Um... Should I... I'll call you. All right. Good night. Good night. You're late. Today a school holiday I don't know about? Yeah, whatever. Hey! Now, you've got to listen to me. Jesse, this is a really bad situation and I am going to make mistakes. Yeah, I noticed. I'm sorry. I am sorry for you kids, I'm sorry for your dad. I am sorry for all of us, but we've got to move on. This is going to be one great birthday. Well, 18 is an important birthday. I... I made reservations at Granger's. Give me a break, that's for kids. You are a kid. We've never missed a family birthday there yet, so let's not start now, okay? Please. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) What's with the books? I've applied to the Audiology program. It's a tough entrance exam. That's going to keep you pretty busy. Jim, I'm going to do this and I'm going to work here. I'm going to take care of my children and I'm going to take care of myself. What I'm not going to do is take care of you. What is it you're trying to say? that how you're gonna feel about what we do is just no longer a consideration for me. You just need to go off and make your life work and let me do the same. I called Granger's to make a reservation and they already had one. But it was for three, so I had it changed. I'm not going to miss my son's 18th birthday. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) Carl has spoken out at the crest. Frankly, I think Jim's job is in serious jeopardy. Why Jim? Why not me? Unvarnished? Yes, unvarnished. You're not gay. Oh! Of course, it's more than that. Ugh! I mean, Jim's a fine doctor. His research is promising, but the board... Everyone is aware that you are the backbone of the institute. That you created its structure. They don't consider you replaceable. And on that point, I have to agree. I don't believe I'm hearing this. But I know that losing Jim would be a body blow to the institute. Well, then what are you saying? I'm saying the board needs to hear this from you. I know it won't be easy for you, but they need to know that you two can overcome the personal problems. (SCOFFS) Personal problems? (CHUCKLES) That seems an inadequate phrase for my life right now. I know. Oh, God, Lewis. I've made some tough decisions lately, and I'm hanging onto them like they're a lifeboat. This is incredibly difficult for me to say, but this is Jim's problem. And I can't get involved in Jim's problems anymore. (MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Hey, pooch. Hi, Dad. (CLEARS THROAT) So... Ready for your exam? Yeah. Have you seen Jesse? No. Oh, Sarah, before I forget, I found this for you. It's, uh... It's an Indian fetish. It's for good luck. I don't like bears. Hey. Hey, sweetheart. Let's eat. Hey, birthday boy. How's life? Failing all my classes and my dad's a queer. (SIGHS) Jesse, God. Couldn't be better. JIM: No, let him say his piece. Can we just get this over with? So, Sarah, are you and Spencer married? Who? Spencer who? Wasn't that his name? Uh, baggy pants, funny hat, picked you up the other night? I wasn't ready to settle down. That's probably very smart. I'm sure you'll have other offers. (BANGS) Can we stop this? Stop what? This whole thing. This dinner. It's a crock. We don't have any tradition. It's dead, just like this family is. Accept it. Right, Mom? Don't blame this on your mother. Your problem is with me. You want to know what I think? Not here. Yes, I do. I think you're a jerk for going off and doing whatever disgusting things you do. Oh, please! JIM: What's the matter, Jesse? Are you feeling threatened because your father is a fairy? Afraid it might just rub off on you? Is that it? I can't hear this. STAFF: ♪ Happy birthday, Jesse Marshall ♪ Here's to you, you're true blue ♪ Eighteen is a special day, celebrated all the way ♪ Here's to you, here's to you ♪ Make a wish. (ALL CHEERING) Jesse? Jesse? Jesse? Hey, Jess? Jesse? Jesse. Is this your car, young man? Get out of my way, man. I'm Detective Oliveres. This is Detective Johnson. Is this your car? What's going on here? Are you related to this young man? He's my son. Is this his car? Of course. Jesse Marshall, you're under arrest for assault and intimidation. Wait a minute, this has got to be a mistake. Sir, sir! We're with the Bias Crime Division... What's going on? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Elaine, Elaine, please, calm down, listen, listen. ...on April 22nd, by a young man who drove off in this Volvo with these tags. What? OLIVERES: Now, we're pretty sure there's been no mistake. JIM: What do you mean, "bias crimes?" Your son assaulted a homosexual young man, that's why we're involved. ELAINE: No, that's impossible, that's completely impossible. Jesse? Sir, this is my card. This is the address of the precinct where he'll be processed. You can pick him up in a couple of hours. Anything you say can and will be used... Jesse... ...against you in a court of law. Honey, it's all right. It's gonna be all right, okay? I'm gonna get there as soon as I can, honey, okay? It's going to be okay. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning. Sarah, get in the car. Take Sarah home, I'll deal with Jesse. Give me that card. Just get away. You've done enough. (ENGINE STARTS) (DOOR BUZZES) Hey, you okay, huh? Yeah. It's okay. Um... I got the name of a lawyer from Lewis Franklin. Okay, this is all going to go away, don't you worry. (SIREN WAILING) In a few months, you're going to graduate, and before you know it, you'll be at college. Don't worry, we're gonna take care of this. You don't even have a clue, do you? You haven't even asked me anything. Asked you what, Jesse? What would you do if I told you I didn't want to go to Boston? That I actually had zero desire to be on the other side of the country, away from Kelley? That's not what I'm talking about. But, Jesse, I don't think this is the best time to change your plans. What plans? You don't even know what I want. You're talking about your plans. Don't I even have a say in this? You haven't even asked me anything. Jesse, you know what's been going on with your dad and me. Everybody in the world knows what's been going on with my mother and my father. What about me? Do you even know what's been going on for me and Kelley? You don't, because you never... You never asked. I'm sorry. It just never occurred to me that you'd wanna stay home. (SCOFFS) Yeah, what home? GAIL: Elaine? Elaine? Come on. You're not ready. The exam starts in an hour. You might wanna finish getting dressed. (SIGHS) Gail, I think this is a mistake. How much of your life did you give this man? What does that mean? It means, if you don't move on, whatever time you have left will be his, too. It's not just that. I haven't even been able to talk to Sarah since that birthday fiasco. And in a few days, I'm going to my son's arraignment. I don't think they've been getting what they need from me. These things will pass, Elaine. Jim is going to start a new life. In three or four years, both the kids are gonna be out of this house. What are you gonna do then? I don't know. I do. You're going to change your clothes. Yes, Mom. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Hey, guys, thanks for coming. It's good to see you. Can I get you anything to drink or... No. Something to eat? No, I'm fine. Sure? Yeah. Okay. Can I have a hug? All right, now. I know you should expect your father to know what he's doing, and I can't begin to understand what I've put you through. But I'm asking you to give me a shot at starting from scratch. And if there's any way I could've made some other choice, I would have, but it would've been a lie. And that's what's wrong with everything that's been going on lately. I have not been truthful with you. Now, I... I will not apologize for being gay. But I'm terribly sorry for ever having lied to you. Are you going to live with a man? I don't know, sweetheart. But I can never live at home again. I love you both very much. And that will never change. Great. Can we go now? No. No, no, please sit down. I want to get everything out on the table. We have all done some stupid things in the last couple of weeks, and if we don't own up to them, things are just going to get worse. What's wrong, sweetheart? I have to go to tai chi. I'm sorry. No... Please. Way to go, Dad. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Sit down. Sit down. That boy you beat up, wasn't him you wanted. Next time you want to hit me, you have the guts to hit me. (EXHALES) So? I have no idea how I did. I don't remember a thing. (CHUCKLING) I think you could use some distraction. Someplace loud. Come on, yeah! (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING) You are full of surprises. Part of my research. When I first thought I might be able to fix him, I started doing some reading. "Fix him"? And now I'd like to just be able to have him fixed. Do you know that 20% of gay men get married? I did not know that. Well, that's the least of it. There's something like a million or two million people with homosexual or bisexual partners. That sounds complicated. Do you want to dance? (STUTTERING) I... I'm with her. WOMAN: Such a big girl. GIRL: I was brave, Mom. WOMAN: Uh-huh. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) What is it? Jim. He's been given a leave of absence. Oh, Jesse. Oh, no, no, I don't think so. Mom, it's just an arraignment. Jesse, please, we're leaving in five minutes. Go put on your good sport coat. Would you stop telling me what to do? I was just suggesting. I think that if you wear the other coat... Stop trying to run my life like you did Dad's. LAWYER: Your Honor, because of Mr. Farber's sexual orientation, and because certain slurs were uttered before and during the attack, we believe Jesse Marshall was motivated to assault him out of hate and bigotry. Therefore the State of Oregon is accusing Jesse Andrew Marshall of assault and intimidation. Mr. Marshall, you've heard the charge against you. How do you plead? Your Honor, consul asks to dismiss due to insufficient evidence. There were no witnesses as to the nature of the altercation. Denied. Mr. Marshall, how do you plead? Not guilty, Your Honor. Very well. Let it be noted for the record, the defendant has entered a plea of not guilty in the matter of Oregon vs. Marshall. (INDISTINCT) Thank you. We'll be talking to you, okay? Thank you for the daffodils. No, you were right. It is the best time of year out there. Elaine, I understand that you feel protective towards Jesse, I mean, especially now. But have you considered the possibility that maybe he did beat up that boy? Have you asked him? Yes. I tried. Shuts me out completely. He doesn't want to talk about it. I suspect he can't talk about it. He doesn't want to make your life more difficult than it already is. He's got to be confused. Well, Jim, I may never completely understand this either. I'm trying. (SIGHS) I mean, we were good together. The four of us. We were a good family. Yes, we were. Oh, God, Jim, we haven't done a very good job with this. And I was so mad at your father that I guess I wasn't taking a very hard look at myself. Jesse, I think you were trying to tell me something the other night. I told you. I don't mean about college. You know, you get to a point in your life where you think there's nothing left to learn about yourself. It's just not true. I had no idea I had so much rage inside of me. Scared the hell out of me. Just can't be perfect in the face of something like this. But I also learned that you can't get over the bad things until you take responsibility for your part in them. Because if you don't, they just stay a part of your life forever. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey. Hi. Is this a bad time? No, no, please come in. Can I, uh, get you something to drink? I made some fresh coffee. Juice? No. No, thanks. Ah, not bad. Could use a woman's touch. Uh-huh. Do you want to sit down? No, I can't stay. Uh... Just want to thank you for being there the other day. Have you heard from the institute? Not yet. I'm not sure what to think. Oh, I have a favor. Jesse has requested a meeting with the Farber boy and his parents in the judge's chambers tomorrow. Really? Why? I don't know. And I was hoping you could be there. Yeah. I'll pick you both up. Oh, great, that would make it easier. Okay, what time? Well, it's at 10:30. I'll be there at 10:00? Great, thanks. (EXHALES) This is a nice building. Mmm. Elaine... I just want you to know that you don't have to worry. You're going to have the house, free and clear, and that money is not going to be a problem in the divorce. Guess you had to use that word. (CHUCKLES) Well, it's the word they use. That's sad, isn't it? (BOTH CHUCKLE) See you tomorrow. Well, I assume somebody has something to say. I have something to say, Your Honor. Shoot. I lied in court the other day. I accept full responsibility for what happened. I did beat up Trey Farber. JUDGE: Why'd you do it, son? It's just... I found out something about my dad and I couldn't handle it. I felt like I was going to lose it. (SOBS) And I did lose it. And I took it out on Trey. And I'm sorry for that. I really am sorry. (INDISTINCT) Your Honor? Um... Is it too late to drop the charges? (SNIFFLES) Oh, we can work with that. They're ready. Okay. I'll be right there. (INTERCOM BEEPS) Yeah, Trish? TRISHI have a Phil Summers for Jim on line two. What should I tell him? Um... I'll take it. Do you mind? (DOOR CLOSES) PHIL: I'm trying to reach Dr. Jim Marshall. Uh, yes, Phil. This is Elaine. Elaine Marshall. Oh. Um... Can I help you? Well, I haven't heard from Jim in a couple of days and he hasn't been in his office, so... Yeah, he's not real good at calling back. (CHUCKLES) Can I give him a message for you? No, that's okay. Thank you. Okay, bye. Elaine? Just talked to Jim's new friend. Wow! How was that? He sounded nice. (INDISTINCT) All right, Mrs. Marshall, we're listening. I won't keep you long. Um... You're all aware that this institute was created by Jim Marshall and Gary Morgan 17 years ago. It exists because the care our patients receive is unequaled in the Pacific Northwest and probably the country. None of you could ever suggest that Jim is not a good enough physician or researcher to remain here, so I can only assume that the reason you would decide to remove him is because you've discovered that he is a homosexual. Now, I don't even want to talk about the legal aspects of such a decision, because Jim would never take it down that road. But I would suggest to you that if his wife can find a way to exist with the fact of his sexuality, that the group in this room can damn well do the same. There has not been a single cancellation, not a single patient comment, and I would bet my life that there will not be one. The only discomfort you were addressing with your decision is your own. Well, you can do the same thing about it that I did, which is grow up and move on. I'm not asking for your understanding, I'm simply asking you for common sense, and common decency. Thank you, Mrs. Marshall. You and Dr. Marshall will be informed of our decision next week. Thank you. Thank you. How about a hematoma on your shin? I'm warning you, I'm wearing Docs. Right. Hey, Dad. Hey, guys, give me the ball. Ooh! Here he goes. Where's he going? Where's he going? He's up! Whoa! That's so unfair. You were so cheating. Come on, give it back. I was not cheating. Come on. That's cheating. Okay, last one, okay? Duel. SARAH: Oh, come on, you're so... Hi. Hi. How're they doing? They're doing pretty good. Oh, looks like your son's going to be going to Portland State. (CHUCKLES) Mmm. Sarah's been talking to him a lot about the divorce. He's really been there for her. He's been so sweet. JESSE: Shoot. SARAH: All right, fine. I thought I'd take them up to the cabin next weekend, if you don't have any plans. No, they'd love it. Have you noticed how wide a berth Carl's been giving me lately? Really? Mmm. Hmm. Listen, whatever you said to the board, I really appreciate it. I know. Is that what I think it is? There. Um... Could I... Okay. When'd you get this? Last month. (LAUGHS) This is fantastic. I'm very proud of you. Thank you. Have you told the kids? No. No. And I wanted to ask you about it first. Because if I do this, if... Mmm-hmm? ...I'll need a little extra help from you. You know, maybe them having dinner a couple more nights a week at your place. Okay. Maybe sometimes picking up Sarah after tai chi... I'm sure we can work that out. Yeah. Well, should we tell the kids? Yeah. Hey, guys. Listen up. Your mom's got some news. What is it, Mom? I'm going to grad school. Cool. Girls rule! Yeah, thanks. (LAUGHS) I knew I should've gone to BU. Now you'll walk to class with me. Go, Sarah! By the way, I think she's going to hit you up later for a trip to the mall. Get the ball, doofus, come on. Don't call your sister a doofus. Hey, Dad. Can I get some sneaks? Told you. You bet, pooch. SARAH: Yes. JIM: Ready to go? Hey, do you wanna go to a movie afterwards? I don't want to go to some girl movie, okay? Girl movie? (SIGHS) Good job, Mom. Thanks. You're dead meat. All right. Switch. Switch, switch. Here.
