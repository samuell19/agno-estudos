It never snows on Christmas anymore. Yeah. Let's go get Daddy. .Dad! .Dad! Daddy! Dad, let's go. Time to decorate the tree. Get the boxes from the attic. I'll be right there. Hurry up. Gramma's on the way. Christmas ornaments. Dad, we've got eggnog for you. Follow me downstairs. Look at this. Thank you. Version TX-130. I think this might be the one. - Okay, safety first. - Yeah. Cross your fingers. (whirring ) ( humming ) Yes! It worked this time! - ( laughs 1 - Yay, Daddy. This little chip generates enough electricity to power an entire house. Dad, that's awesome. But we've got to get the house decorated before Gramma gets here. Oh, yeah. Okay, you guys go downstairs, get started. I will be right there. Glasses back, please. I might invest in that. - Oh, really? That'd be fantastic. -( phone rings) - Yeah, you never know. - I think it's a good idea. - Eric. - Stu. - My man. - You're not gonna believe this. The TX-130 scores off the charts. I am holding the future of renewable energy in my hand. I knew you'd crack it. Did I ever lose faith? Your investment made it possible, Stu. Listen, you should really see it. I could meet you in town. I'm sure it's amazing, but we can't get into the patent office until after the holidays. Put it someplace safe and we'll catch up. Stu, did you hear what I just said? This thing changes everything. It's Christmas Eve, Eric. Santa's on the way. Merry Christmas. Girls: Ho ho ho. Okay, let's get this party started. Eric: Have a bit of a mess, don't we? I miss Mommy. I know, pumpkin. I miss her, too. But we'll do our best to try to have a good Christmas this year. Dad. - Give me a hand with this. - Okay. Here. What's this, Dad? Oh, wow. I haven't seen that in years. ( chuckles ) This is-- this is my elf from when I was a kid. He was my favorite. Your favorite toy was a doll? ( laughs) Yeah. Oh, hey, Dad. That lady Amy from the butcher shop called. Something about a ham. Yes, the ham. Oh, the ham. - Mm. -( horn honks) Both: Gramma's here! ( laughs) ( honking horn ) - Kasey: Merry Christmas, Gramma. - Oh, hon. Here's my two favorite grandkids. I'll carry these. No peeking, no shaking. Hi, Mom. Merry Christmas. Where are you off to in such a hurry? I've got to do some last minute stuff. You think you can handle these two? I think I can handle them. I handled you, didn't I? Nothing could be worse. Hey, listen, okay? Gramma's in charge, all right? I'll be right back and we'll finish trimming the tree. - Thanks. - Bye, son. Gramma: Would you take those inside now and I'll bring the car in the garage. Okay. Gramma, let me give you hand with this. Oh, thanks, hon. I appreciate it. - Here's your cane, Gramma. - Thank you, sweetheart. Oh, my gosh. Oh, what a lovely tree. Dad was busy, so we aren't finished decorating it. Oh, well. Let's get right back to it. You can go ahead and take those things out. This one's for me. Uh-huh, but you can't open it till morning. Can we open one tonight? I have one, just one, that we can open right now. Both: Goody, goody, goody! (growling ) Gramma's famous fruitcake. Wow, Gramma. Awesome. We should really save this for a special occasion. But it's Christmas. I mean, a really special occasion like my birthday. Next August? Exactly. Let's see. There we go. ( Marching band playing ) We're recording live from the downtown Christmas procession. Where good cheer is in great abundance. Wait, this just in. Wow, did you hear what I heard? The Air Force tracking station in Kenosha, Wisconsin, ls reporting a strange object in the sky. Yeah, this is incredible. Apparently, this object is coming down from the North Pole. Choir: .'

'Tis the season. I have your order right here. Um, how are you? - Great. Yeah. - How are things? Good. Yeah. - Your kids? - Oh, they're great. Yeah. Well, I'm-- you know, this time of year is always a little tough. Of course. That's understandable. Yeah. The decorations look amazing. You guys do an awesome job with the shop. - It's all her doing. - Oh. - Oh! - Ah, thanks. Thank you. Wow. - Merry Christmas, Amy. - Merry Christmas. - To you and yours. - Thanks. - Amy. - Is the ham okay? Oh, uh, yes. It's-- yeah. Look, I know it's Christmas Eve and you probably have plans with family or-- Actually, I don't. Oh, well, if you'd like, you could maybe stop by. We're just having Christmas dinner with the family. You know, the kids and my mother. And she can be kind of a handful, but maybe you-- - That'd be nice. - Oh. Well, we're having ham this year instead of turkey. I know. Right. Except... we're open late and I took the whole shift. Oh, well, no problem. - I mean, you could- - I really would like to. Well, you could stop by whenever. I mean, the door is open. You know, we'll be up. We'll be trimming the tree and making cookies and, you know, Christmas. It's so sweet of you to ask. Oh. - Merry Christmas. - Yeah, Merry Christmas. - Ahem. - Oh, Mr. Glavenstein. I'll have Mr. Pickerini's turkey ready in a minute. - Go. - But there's no one else here. Merry Christmas. Now get out of here before I change my mind. (squeals) Happy Hanukkah, Mr. Glavenstein. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hanukkah's over. Go. - Go. - Mwah! (alarm chirps) Man: Pardon me, Professor Harper. (ticking ) ( snoring ) Gramma. Gramma! Where's Dad? I'm sure he's busy getting presents for a certain good boy and little girl. Probably still at the butcher shop. - Huh? - He thinks the butcher's cute. Mr. Glavenstein? No, the lady butcher. Her name is Amy. Oh, really? He said he'd be back to finish decorating the tree. And bake cookies. But I already baked you cookies. Oh, it's 3:00. Time for bed. Are you serious? Dad always lets us-- Whoa. No smart talk from you, young man. You take your plate to the kitchen. Go brush your teeth. Or Santa Claus won't come. Lights out in five minutes. - March. - Ryan: This stinks. Why the glum face, sweetie? This is the worst Christmas ever. ( Chuckles ) I don't know about that. Why does Daddy hate Christmas? Oh, honey, he doesn't hate it. It's just that this time of year brings up a lot of memories. For me, too. Of course. Do you know this once belonged to your great grandfather? He handed it down and then your father had it. And now it's your turn. Oh, Kasey, I know you miss your mommy. We all do. It's like with Grandpa. She isn't ever coming back. I know. At some point in time, everybody, even your father, has to move on. But we won't ever forget your mother. You know, it was always believed that when times got really tough you could make a wish on this little fellow. And sometimes, a real elf would appear and help you out. Sounds unrealistic. Well, Christmas is about hope. About wishes coming true. You never can tell. I wish we could be a happy family again. And bring Dad home. That's all I want for Christmas. Gramma: Night-night, honey. - Kasey: Good night. - Sweet dreams. ( Rumbling ) Whoa. Whoa. Easy. All right, what have we got here? Harper family, correct? Yes, sir. But, Mr. Claus. Ah. -( Knocks) - Incoming. Huh? Oh, I'm on it. -( Reindeer bellows ) -( stomach gurgling) Can you believe, after all these years, I finally get sleigh duty and my job is chief pooper scooper? ( Fa rt$ ) ( bellows ) I don't know, I've been thinking. Is it all really worth it? We're got the best boss in the world. We build toys. Spread joy to children all over the world. What's not to like? Back in the day, all you had to do was give a kid a broken stick and pile of mud. Now you have to give 'em this gadget and that gizmo and everything expensive. It's out of control. It's not fun anymore. Look, you're an elf. You've always been an elf and that's what you'll always be. Santa's little helper. (sighs) I keep thinking there's something more out there for me. (sighs) ( Kasey crying ) Navigator: Little Green to Big Red. We're falling behind schedule. We need you back in the cockpit ASAP. Roger that. (crying continues) - Well? - Nothing. All right, so you don't have the chip on you. - Where is it? Come on! -( muffled speaking ) You'd better spill the beans, otherwise you will suffer the consequences, my friend. - Speak up! -( muffled speaking ) Maybe you should take the tape off of his mouth. Do not tell me how to conduct my business. - Take the tape off his mouth. - Oh, right away. - Ow! - Well? I, um, dropped it in the mail before I went shopping. ( laughs ) Come on. We're been trailing you since you left your house. You didn't drop it anywhere. You are going to tell us exactly where you stashed that chip. Right now! Hey, Santa, I was thinking. How about a little raise? Ho ho ho! - Whoa! - ( thuds) (grunts) ( snorts ) ( panting ) Santa! What about me? - What was that? - Shh. All right, men. This is gonna be a simple in and out operation. I've got a top-notch security system. It's like Fort Knox. You guys will never get past it. We'll see about that. Wait a minute. There is someone guarding his front door. - What? - What? Who is that? That's my private guard. Private guard? Look, it's just a little boy doing the tricks and treats. - What? - He's dressed like a munchkin. Yes, he's-- wait. - It's not Halloween night. - It's Christmas Eve. Shut up! Everybody just clam it! That's not a munchkin. That, my friends... is a troll. Troll? What is a troll doing guarding your house on Christmas Eve? That's my patrol troll. Patrol troll? All: Patrol troll. - This is a game changer. - What's the big deal? - I'm not afraid of a troll. - You should be. Germany. 1975. I was leading a Navy SEAL team on recon into East Germany. We came to a river near Munchenberg. Eight men crossed that bridge. Only one came back. Which one, Mickey? Oh. Really? Really? One troll, eight Navy SEAL-5? What were the other seven Navy SEAL-s doing- Stop it, will you? We've got to regroup here and rethink this whole thing. Get us out of here. We need a hideout. Mickey: Oh, there's an old barn to the left. In there. Get in there. - ( Tires squeal) - Mickey: Hey, we're off-road now. - Where are we going? - Who knows where we're going? You're driving, shouldn't you know? Mickey: No, no, the left, you idiot. ( Gasps ) Whew. "Dad." "Ryan." "Kasey." And... (chuckles) -( shouting ) -( glass shatters ) - Whoa! - No, Ryan. .( Ryan shouting ) - Stop! (screams) (groaning ) ( snorts ) ( panting ) Oh. Kids. Hi, my name is Kasey. Ryan: Oh, my gosh. Who let you out of the chocolate factory, dude? I am not an oompa loompa. Then you're friends with Frodo? ( Groans ) I'm not a hobbit. Ryan, he's an elf. Whoa, freaky. You two guys are little brats. - That's what Santa calls you. - He does not. Wait, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the North Pole making toys. All a big mix-up. You see this distress beacon? Santa's gonna swing back by and pick me up soon. So go to bed and when you wake up in the morning, you won't remember any of this even happened. Is there mistletoe in this house? Dad doesn't get it anymore. Not since Mom-- Don't worry, nobody's gonna be trying to kiss you. ( Scoffs ) I'm out of here. Push rewind, zip-zip. - I was never here. - But wait. (clangs) Got the varmint. - Gramma! - Gramma! Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold. All right, we're clear. Look, if it's money that you want, I can take you to an ATM right now. You think we're suckers? We know the chip is worth millions. Look, I have got kids in that house. So can we leave them out of this? Look, shut up. I don't want to hear another word from you. - Otherwise I'm gonna... -( clicking ) All right. Listen up. Here's the plan. Big Bucket, you are gonna take out all the LAN lines and cell towers all along this road. What? And then there was a convenience store that we passed - a couple of miles back. - Ah, a convenience store. Mickey, if I could just get a couple of items. No. No! There's just one item that you need to get. That is a can... off this. - Troll Off? - That's right. Big Bucket: You want regular or extra strength? Scented or unscented? They have extra strength? - Hurry up! - Stay away from my house! Or what? We're gonna get past that troll and we're gonna get that chip. Ah, Mickey, we do not have to wait for Big Bucket. What are you talking about? I will gain entry by creating a ruse and pretending that I am a blue collar electrician. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No one's gonna buy a Frenchy repair man around here. What you do not realize, mon petit grande fromage, is that I am the world's most recognized master of disguise. ( Bubbling ) (tinkling ) You the one that hit me? Do that thing again with the bubble. I'll get my video camera. We'll get a zillion hits. Kasey: No, Ryan, he's like Santa Claus. Nobody's allowed to see him. It's special just for us. - Right? - Yeah. I wished for him to come and help us. Whoa, what did you just say? I made a wish to this doll just like Gramma said. Isn't that remarkable? Let me see it. Yeah, I made him. He must be a very old elf. Thanks, Santa. So here's the deal. Child makes a wish upon the elf doll-- toys, cash in small bills, whatever- the elf is supposed to grant the wish before Santa comes back to pick him up by daybreak. What did you wish for? I wished for our family to be happy again. That's kind of vague. And for my daddy to come home. I can make that happen. He was supposed to be home over two hours ago. Where did he go? He went into town to see a lady and he's not back yet. Oh, a lady, huh? So if I get your dad back, then we're good? I guess. Done deal. -( Knocking ) - See? That's how I roll. Did Dad forget his key? Dads always come home. Oh, it's just you. Merry Christmas. Ryan James Harper, you open that door instantly. Oh, my word. I am so sorry. Who are you? - Ryan: The butcher lady. - Kasey: Amy. Oh, Eric's friend. Hello. Won't you come in? I'm sorry. The toy store was closed. I brought cold cuts. Thanks. It's not my dad. - It's the butcher. - What? Quick, hide upstairs. I hope I'm not intruding. Eric-- your dad invited me. Dad's not-. Uh, no. He's not dressed yet. I'm Gramma Harper. Ryan, take her coat, dear. - Please, come in. - Thank you. There. Oh, that darn cat. - Makes a mess of everything. - We don't have a cat. Shh. Stay here. Make noises like my dad. Hey, that's not part of the deal. Just do it. I'm in charge of you. (groans) He usually sings in the shower. I'm tone deaf. Sing! (groans) Do you like eggnog, dear? Oh, yes. Yes, I do. Ryan, show Amy a place to sit by the fire. Everything looks so Christmassy. Hi.

And we kidnapped- we kidnapped this scientist just to steal his invention just to sell it for money. I've been driving around cutting down phone lines and knocking down cell towers. We got this guy tied up in a barn. This scientist guy tied up in a barn. I could take you there right now. We could rescue this guy. Man, we could be heroes. ( laughs) Payback time. You got me. You're good. Is Jimmy Hoffa down in that barn, too? Yeah, he's down there, too. Man, you had me going. All right, big man, you deliver them flowers. - All right. - Have a merry Christmas. And a happy New Year to you, too. Pea brain. ( exhales ) ( knocking ) Can I help you? Oh, howdy, madame. My name is... Hank. Mr. Harper asked me to come look at the faulty wiring in his laboratory. Then I will mosey on down to the holler with my hound doggies and hunt the opossum and drink moonshine in my big muddy truck with the overgrown tires. ( spits ) Y'all. Tonight? I mean, where on earth is Eric? Oh, he-- he got tied up. But don't worry. He insisted that I take care of this tonight so that your house does not burn to the ground. Ruin y'alls Christmas. I warned him about that. I told him it was dangerous to do those experiments upstairs. Don't worry, madame, I will take care of everything. Oh, well... I'm sure you know where it is. Of course I do... know where it is. Ryan: Who was that, Gramma? It's the electrician. He's here to fix something up in your dad's lab. On Christmas Eve?

( shouting ) (thudding ) Where is the chip? - ( Shrieks ) - I don't know! (grunting ) - Jean-Pierre: Get off of me! - Hey! ( Gasps ) You're not an electrician. And who are you?

He looks like a reject from the Christmas parade. He's an elf. A real elf. Show her, dude. Do one of your magic things. .( Gasps) -( kids laugh) So you wished for an elf to come and help you? And he appeared? Because Santa ditched me. Santa. And the creepy man upstairs was? Wait, that guy was trying to steal my dad's invention. - What invention? - His TX-130 solar cell. It makes enough energy to power a whole house. So your dad never came home from town, did he? We didn't want you to leave 'cause Dad really likes you. Elf-Man: Hey. That's the same van that took the robber. What? There's someone in that barn. The Taylor place? That's been abandoned for years. I'm calling the police. There's no service. ( Busy signal beeping ) What's wrong, Amy? Nothing, sweetheart. Maybe the robber knows something about Dad. I bet he kidnapped him. Hey, we don't know that. I hate to say it, but the boy might be on to something. Yeah. You promised to get my daddy back. Daddy's never gonna come home. Hey, hey, hey. Your wish is my promise. I'll find your dad. I'm going to that barn right now. - Alone? -( Kasey crying ) It could be dangerous. Hey, danger is my middle name. Actually, it's Elmer, but let's not get into that. Don't worry. Just sit tight. I'm gonna scope out the sitch. ( Door closes ) Dear Santa, what I want for Christmas is a deserted beach and a tropical drink with an umbrella. But first I got to deal with some knuckleheads who made a little girl cry. Troll or leprechaun or whoever is guarding your house, is not gonna stand between us and our own pot of gold. Give it up, Mickey. You'll never get past that troll. Qh, yeah? Now, look, you could make this easy on yourself by just telling me where that billion-dollar chip is hidden. Daddy-O. Or we are going to tear that sweet little house of yours apart splinter by splinter, kids or no kids. If you touch one hair on my children's heads, you will regret it. ( Bottles breaking ) What was that? We have us a visitor. ( Rattling ) Here, little trolly. Come on out, you little green man. Come on. Let's just talk about this. What do you say, huh? - Come on out, troll. -( clanging ) There he is! Mickey: Open this up, you little creep. Open up! Go around. Get out of my way. You-- you're a-- - Don't say it. - You're an elf! Thank you. What are you doing here? I'm here to rescue you. ( laughs) Long story about a little girl who wished upon an old elf doll. - Kasey? - Yeah. Oh, I knew it. All those years I spent believing. And then-- then I grew up, I suppose. But you-- I mean, you really exist. If we don't get out of here, neither one of us is gonna exist. ( Gasps ) ( laughing ) oh! I tried. He's getting away. Hey! (wind blowing ) A little help here. Whoa! Whoa! Ah! (screaming ) Do you see him? ( Crashes ) We're not dealing with a troll. Or a leprechaun. This is-. This is something far more... evil. Jean-Pierre: Like what? Like what night is tonight? Tonight? Christmas Eve. Yes. And so who helps with the presents on the sleigh? - An el... - Elephant? Come on, no. Pointy ears, helps Santa. No, no, no, I think you're on the wrong track, Mickey. It's a Christmas elf. I'm gonna squash that pointy-eared pipsqueak like a bug! Oh, you say this now, but you'll be singing a different tune as soon as he puts his bony elbow in your eye. - Wait, wait. - He's right, you know. He's a Christmas elf with special powers. He's come to rescue my family. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, no. Oh, no. Don't you be playing your little mind games with me. We're going in and we're getting that chip. You'll never get past the elf. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. You think I haven't dealt with elves before? Bucket, with me. JP, watch him. . Ea$V- . Hell)- Heavens to Betsy. Did you find Eric? Yeah, bad guys have him tied up to a chair at that old barn. - Is he all right? - No. He's tied up by bad guys. You just left him there? Deal was find him. I found him. Wish granted. Now I'm going out on the roof to wait for my ride. You promised to bring my daddy back. I make toys. That's all I know. That's all I'll ever be good for. Go ahead, leave. We can take care of ourselves. - Yeah. - Yeah. We don't need quitters around here. I've done all I can do. I'm done. Ryan: We've got to rescue Dad somehow. Kasey: Elf-Man can help us. I know he can. Amy: What did you just call him? - Kasey: Elf-Man. - Ryan: Like Superman. Or Spiderman. He's like a superhero who has special powers but doesn't know how to use them yet. Amy: If only we could find a way to make Elf-Man believe in himself so he could realize his true potential. - A costume. - Gramma: What, Kasey? Let's make Elf-Man a costume. ♪ It came upon a midnight clear ♪ ♪ That glorious song of old ♪ ♪ From angels bending near the Earth ♪ ♪ To touch their harps of gold ♪ ♪ Peace on the Earth, goodwill to men ♪ ♪ From heaven's all-gracious king ♪ ♪ The world in solemn stillness lay ♪ ♪ To hear the angels sing... ♪ ( Beeping ) ♪ And ye. beneath life's crushing load... ♪ ( laughing ) What about this?

We thought if you just had a costume, maybe- Lady. Do I look like a superhero? Well, no superhero looks like a superhero until they discover their true powers. I've been making toys for years. Getting them out on Christmas wondering the whole time what it would be like down here in the world of kids. Now I know. You people are crazy. And you have a really bad attitude. Now you listen to me. You are Elf-Man. At least to Ryan and Kasey. Those two kids have lost the most important thing any two kids could ever lose. Their mommy. And their dad's been working really hard to hold things together. You have any idea how hard things have been for this family? If there's only one thing you learn about how it works down here, you get this straight. It's not all about you. Christmas is about giving. About bringing joy into other people's lives. And just maybe if you tried it once, you might find it can make you feel good about yourself, too. (thuds) They have their strengths. But Christmas elves also have their weaknesses. Superman has his kryptonite. Christmas elves have their... mistletoe. - Go get that. - Why me? 'Cause I said so. I'm the boss. Jean-Pierre's guarding the prisoner. - Exactly. - How you doing? - Good. -( grunts) You're supposed to be guarding the guy. - Oh! - You idiot. I told you. I told you to stay with him. Mickey. I think the scientist is missing. All right. All right. It's time to rip this up. He isn't moving. Did he freeze to death? I think he's just really bummed about being a chicken. Eric: Ryan! Kasey! Where are you? Dad? ( Panting ) - Both: Daddy! - Am I glad to see you guys. - Did Elf-Man save you? - Well, kind of. - How did he get here? - I wished for him to come help us. See, I knew it. I knew it. Where's Gramma? Gramma: Well, well, better late then never. - Oh! - You had me worried sick. Oh, well, you made it. Well, we were having eggnog. Eric. Have those bad men really gone away? Oh. Okay, everybody in the kitchen right away. (van approaching) Sunday's a comin'. Ryan, take your sister downstairs and lock the door. Ryan: Dad, I can help you. Quick, Kasey, we need ammo. Ma, if I don't get a chance to say this later, I want you to know that you are the most special mother in the whole world and I love you with all of my heart. Eric, that's wonderful. But we've got to get ready now to take those clowns down. Right. I'll watch the kids. Nobody gets past me. Some Christmas dinner, huh? I'm just glad you're okay, Eric. I'm glad you decided to visit. No problem. Thanks for protecting Ryan and Kasey. They're great kids. We've got to lock the doors. What the...? Amy, give me a hand with the couch. ( Groans ) Stop it! What are you doing? You're naughty. You will get nothing but a lump of coal for Christmas. Keep 'em coming. Stop it. (ticking loudly) - Okay, we locked all the windows. - Check. - We locked all the doors. - Check. (squeaking ) (wind blowing ) (wind blowing ) (bell tolling) ($Wing squeaks) (bells jingling) ($Wing squeaks) Why don't you go crawl back under the rock you came from? 'Cause you got no business here. Who says? Elf-Man! ( Scoffs ) Ha! ( laughs) (crackling ) Not mistletoe! -( Zapping ) - Mickey: Come on. Down. Mickey: Stay back! Elf-Man! You let the elf go! Make me. - Kasey: Stop, you're hurting him. - Gramma: You let the elf go! Mom, just take it easy. '( Groaning ) - Shut up! You are going to give me the TX-130 right now. You are a vile and disgusting human being. Ooh, and you are my type. You have no right to take my dad's invention. Oh, you are correct, but we're doing it anyway. 'Cause we are big and strong and you are little and weak. (groaning ) Okay, enough. All right, let him go. We'll give you what you came for. Kasey, give me the elf doll. Elf doll? What? - Oh! - Big Bucket: Oh, yeah, cha-ching. - Viola. - There it is. There it is. There it is. ( laughing ) We're out of here. Whoo! Ryan, don't! - Eric: No. - Amy: Ryan. Ryan. - No, drop it. - Let it go, son. Kiss. Kiss under the mistletoe. It'll reverse the negative energy. Kasey: It's working. Keep kissing. I am not a hobbit. I am not a leprechaun, nor troll, nor munchkin. I am none of these things. I am Elf-Man! - Go, Elf-Man! - Go! ( Sputtering ) ( music playing on radio) ( jets roar ) I don't care if you're from Mars. You will watch your speed in my neck of the woods. (siren blaring ) -( jets roar ) - Whoa! What the heck was that? - A shooting star? - Helicopter? No, it's Elf-Man. He's gonna be elf roadkill. (engine revs) (thuds) What? Ah! (tires squealing) (engine stalls) No! Elf, get out of my way. You got something that doesn't belong to you. Ah! (gulps) No! ( swallows ) No! Come on! ( Crashes ) Mickey: You did this. Don't let him get away again, you idiot. HO! Ha! (whistling ) I'm not leaving without that chip. You hear me, elf? He's up there. Bucket, watch that door. You... - Where are the kids? - Ryan? Kasey? - Where'd they go? - Go, go, go! (whistling ) Shh. (whistling continues) Hey, listen. Why don't you just step on out here and we can talk about this man to elf? Hey! - Gotcha! -( kids screaming) You stay away from those kids. (grunting ) ( shouts ) I'm sure that we can come to some sort of an arrangement. What do you say? Huh? (grunting ) Ah! Whoa! - You okay? - I'm good. The cavalry's coming. Just come on. ( Door slams ) Mickey: Oh, someone's up after their bedtime. Ryan: Go, Elf-Man. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ow. Hey! Little help here. - Ow! - Jean-Pierre: It's the naughty brats. Every look in the mirror, French fry? (groans) What are-- get them! They're just kids. - Gentlemen. - You idiot. May I show you the door? There you are. I'm gonna wipe that Christmas cheer right off your face. Ryan: Psst, Dad. Ah! Ryan: Psst, Elf-Man. ( laughs ) A fruit cake? Is that all you've got, elf? ( Rumbling ) oh! Whoa! Ah! (screaming ) (grunts) What the...? (straining ) ( roaring ) (screaming ) ( laughing ) (siren blaring ) This isn't over! I'll get you for this, Elf-Man. You're not going anywhere, you naughty, naughty boy Ma'am, I got this. Get her away from me! Looks like you boys got some explaining to do. - Now get up. - ( groaning ) What happened to Dad's chip? Excuse my manners, but... ( burps) Thank you. Is Santa coming back to get you? You're gonna leave us? - I'm afraid I have to. - No! Kasey. Look, this is tough for me, too. You and your brother are the best friends an elf could ever have. You had faith in me. You made me realize who I really am. I'm Elf-Man. You can live with us and fight crime. Kasey, my true home is the North Pole, making toys and bringing joy all over the world. Santa's counting on me. But if you ever need my help again, make a wish and I'll be here. I love you, Elf-Man. I love you, too. (crying ) I never got a single toy when I was a kid. Every Christmas, nothing. Me, neither. All I ever got was a tiny little Grand Prix racecar. But it was missing a tire. I didn't even get that. Dad, where are they going? They are going to jail. On Christmas? - Be good, bud. - I will. Don't let her go. She's a keeper. ( laughing ) Merry Christmas! Wow! I guess he really is a superhero. Amazing. Whoa. -( Eric laughs) - Gramma: It's amazing. You see that? Look at all that. Wow. Perfect. Yeah, let's get a little closer.
