The county magistrate has epilepsy Let's go and see Help... Some people force girls into prostitution Is there anyone? Of course. What are you screaming for? Do you know it's still Merryland here?

I didn't steal any money Actually she captured me to her place Lady Chun I didn't know she is from Merryland Please forgive me... This is a little token I can't accept it Thank you! Thanks! Let's go! I almost believed what you just said What? You said that as long as you were here no one will bully the civilians Did I say that? No Didn't you? Nope Silly girl! What is the law? The gold is the law Don't you get it? Didn't you see that the county magistrate... is here before? You didn't need to go out... and seek the help of some other officer Come, wear something pretty In fact, the world out there... isn't much better than here in Merryland Don't think too much! All the women will eventually get married... have children, get into cooking & cleaning Working for husbands rest of their lives It'll be forever Your happiness depends on him You can't stay here for the rest of your life Take me for instance I do hope that you can marry a good man And leave here sooner You've been poor before How do you used to live before? Sleeping on the streets, and always starving... isn't that a tough life? Be patient! Help me out for time being I'll call you Ai Nu Sir, you haven't been here for many days My dear county magistrate Is Ai Nu really that good? Yes She is fantastic I'll never lie to you Look!

Mr. Lee Lady Chun, you may leave Take care of yourself Do me a favor! Just a favor! Get out! No, no Don't be afraid Let me take off your clothes There is still a virgin's sense Come on What do you mean? I'll do it myself Yourself? Baby You got lots of tricks What the hell are you doing? I'm afraid Afraid? No wonder the county magistrate remarked... 'You're different than other girls' You know how to tease men Baby All right, it's enough I'm too old for this What the hell do you want? I beg of you! Would you please! I really can't What? You can't No way Where are you going? You can't run this time Dead? Everyone out Inform the county magistrate immediately Yes What are you looking at? Ai Nu, Ai Nu I'm Lady Chun... Drink some tea Come on, help me take off my clothes first I didn't mean to kill him Ai Nu, it's all right Don't cry! It'll be OK Look! No one is in here... except you and me Tell me why do our women... need to let the men play? Why they don't care about what we think? Silly girl! This is the way for us women Like me My dad passed away when I was three And mother contracted tuberculosis My uncle kicked us out After that, mother & I were bound by same fate We lived on streets and begged Once a while we would have food to eat After a few years mother died too I met the lady boss of Merryland She took me in I still recall the first time I was here I was very curious Had never seen such a beautiful place She saw that I was filthy She took my clothes off and gave me a shower Silly girl! You're very pretty Be a good girl You'll find a good husband Since that time... The lady boss liked me very much Dressed me up like others I've always been beautiful From that day on I served the lady boss And also earned money for her Normally, you'd take me for a very serious kind In fact, we have similar background You have the same story like mine But you've got to remember Never cry and ever ask for help You mean... Agreed, if it's a bright future you're looking for... one does need some luck Silly girl! You'll have to handle lots of men later Could it be said that you killed each of them? Let Lady Chun teach you step by step Trust me, men just love touching those parts! You'll get used to it soon Relax May I know your good name? How come I've never seen you earlier? My name is Lin Yun I was sent here early this month I heard that Mr. Lee died here yesterday I'm here to investigate You're from out of the town No wonder you're so early Yes Have you visited the county magistrate yet? Beg your pardon? I said, before coming here... did you go to see the county magistrate? The investigation is our duty I don't need to bother him Especially it's early morning Perhaps he'd be still asleep Who says so? How do you know that I haven't gotten up? My respects, sir Get out! Go away! Officer Fu Yes Who told you that Mr. Lee died here? Sir All of us are aware that he died at home Sir I went to inquire of Lee's family They told me that he didn't die at home He died here for sure And it was a homicide Did you see it with your own eyes? No So it's just your hearsay Officer Fu said that he died at home Why can't you believe it? Sir... No more Finally, my judgement is... Mr. Lee died at home If you have too much free time... you may go to his home Question his wife Investigate how she killed her husband! That's right, Officer Lin Do you want me to prepare a sedan chair... for you to go to Lee's home? Leave now I'm leaving Miss Did I see you somewhere? No, you must've got the wrong person Come in, Ai Nu I remembered that it was a cold night I put a blanket on her It's strange Uncanny resemblance, I'd say! There was a beautiful girl in the forest When were the wind bring her back? Say, if it ain't her... where did the girl of that windy night go? Ai Nu The county magistrate did you a big favor You have to repay him today You understand, don't you? Look! For rest of your life all that jewelry... would stand you in good stead Come... Ai Nu. Come quickly Come to see what you did get Do you like it? Look! Ai Nu This necklace is a gift from me Do you like it? And... This is a gold bracelet. Take a look! Your skin is so smooth Is it worth a lot? Yes, good for the rest of your life I can do it now. I'm coming Hurry up! Come on! It sounds great like you said It's very easy to make money Gradually you'll understand The money can really talk Is the county magistrate good enough? Forget it. He made me so uncomfortable Am I right? I did say he ain't as considerate as me No, Ms. Chun Are you sure? What's wrong? Never seen a naked woman? No, I heard you scream all of a sudden I thought something had happened Really? You must miss your Lady Chun That's the reason you are here No, I'm leaving Come on Don't go You can't get away Mr. Ju San Hurry! Lady Chun... It's Mr. Ju San How rare! What brought you here? It's not that rare! But it reminded us of the scar wound And also my brother's broken arm Suddenly we thought about you Do you really want to sleep with me? That won't be too difficult This skirt can be easily removed This table is like a big bed Come on, who is first? Big brother Lady Chun, you misunderstood! He isn't fond of women He likes tracking mountains Please hand me that guy from the other day You may leave Last time I should have killed you This time Merryland is in real trouble. Go Xiao Ye Don't be jumpy! Take a look! Why not? For the power and the money You need to kill more people Are you a human or beast? Lady Chun, Xiao Ye... I know... say it again slowly You clean it up quickly And then attend to the customers Do you always come here to nurse the wounds... after you killed someone? I saw the way you killed others You didn't pay any attention to yourself Ever since I was little I knew it took blood to kill Also I was ready to die everytime I killed someone I remembered the first time I saw you You said you only killed someone you disliked And die for a worthy cause I don't like anyone that Ms. Chun dislikes I'll gladly die for Ms. Chun So she is your real elder sister? No, you are wrong We are not related I remember the day I met Ms. Chun It was a very, very cold morning You stupid girl... dare to steal food! I'll beat you to death Eat! Mom Hurry up! Mom You! Why did you hit them? Hurry up, sister. Go This knife saved her I've been staying with Ms. Chun since From that day on We grew up here The owner passed away later Ms. Chun became the lady boss I don't use this knife anymore I changed to the sword For the last couple of years you've used this sword to kill those people that Ms. Chun disliked? In the beginning... only for the bad guys But Ms. Chun changed She would kill for money Do you know... why does Ms. Chun like you the most? Why? You look like her when she was young You're poor, pretty and very stubborn But not anymore Ms. Chun has changed, so did I You will too Why should I change? The circumstances are like this knife And we are like this sweet potatoes Gold and desire Bit by bit... slowly You won't be the same anymore either I'm getting sick of myself I myself don't know why do I need to kill! Sometimes even I get scared I'm afraid I'll die under someone else's sword Xiao Ye, Xiao Ye Why isn't it possible to live in the past... just one more time? If possible, I'd like to live in the good old days Did you have any beautiful memories? Ought to cherish them if you did Otherwise you would never get it back when you changed Please come in! I'll get Uncle Chang It's very quiet here! The owner must be a gentleman I met a beautiful lass days back in the forest Wonder when'd the wind bring her back again? Miss, are you looking for our master? Yes, Mr. Lin is... He has a business trip He won't be back today Can you leave a message? Please give him back the blanket Yes Tell him that I'm the girl in the forest Where have you been? Ai Nu The county magistrate waited for a long time Didn't you say... I don't need to entertain the guests anymore? Do you think that I like it? He is not some ordinary customer In Merryland there'd be many an occasion... when his help would be needed Come here! Let's put some more make up You only care what you want Isn't the rest important to you? What are you saying? For example whatever happened to Xiao Ye last night He risks his life... to kill those trouble mongers When it was over... you went back to your business You didn't care for his life You treat him like a dog Have you ever thought... he has been through so much with you He is so much like your family The only one you got And me You told me that no one will touch me again It only took one day to change your mind I was doing it for Merryland No, you don't care for others You're selfish Xiao Ye is right Year after year We'll never know the reason for our existence It's boring even I don't like it Or I don't want to see it But I have to face it everyday Is that so? I'm just waiting for it all to end well Waiting? And let the time of our youth... and wonderful moments just slip by! Youth? Wonderful moments? When I was young... I didn't ever have any happiness That's why I willingly stayed on in Merryland Listen to me! Ai Nu It's no longer important if you find a husband Be patient! It's not easy to find a good man So you want me to serve... the county magistrate today, right? I'm ready. Leave All right! Go! Did anyone die here? Mr. Lin No, I'm looking for Ms. Ai Nu Who is looking for Ai Nu? Me What's the matter? I knew her before She came to see me today Help! Ai Nu You... How come... Lin Yun Lin Yun Ai Nu Please listen to me Ai Nu Lin Yun Lin Yun, please listen to my explanation Lin Yun You listen to me Shut up! I just want to ask you now Why did you come to my house? Tell me! Because someone once asked me... If there is the best time of your life... You need to cherish it That's why you lie on the bed naked... holding on to the jewellery Forget it! We did meet once before... and I said that you didn't owe me anyway Lin Yun Before you leave... may I ask you a question? Go ahead Is it true that once if you make a mistake... you won't be able to turn back? I don't know I just know that if you commit a crime... you're forever a criminal Forever? I see What's wrong with you? Ai Nu What happened today... between you and the officer? Nothing I just believed what Xiao Ye said... last night If we could turn back our lives... we would cling on to our best moments He was wrong I found out just now It just ain't possible to turn one's life around Ai Nu is in love I'm telling you. Stop dreaming! First of all, Xiao Ye is a prodigal, a killer He is not your type Second, the poor government officer He doesn't deserve my Ai Nu If I can't find the true love... then I'd stay at Merryland the rest of my life? That's right There is no other place... that can accept the kind of women we are I'll be the second Lady Chun in the future? You should learn from me Treat all the customers nicely Maybe you'll find a husband It's not difficult to be Lady Chun though The question is: can the conscience be ignored? Except Merryland, Lady Chun's whole life... without friendship, no friends No affection without relatives Also without love Without love? How about you? Then it's just compassion and pathetic Besides being a pastime Ai Nu, what the hell are you doing? You said that I only have one choice So, right now I'm ready for my only choice The choice that you haven't tried before Where are you going? Ai Nu, Ai Nu Lady Chun wouldn't tell others what she does Maybe I'm going to find a man Ai Nu Man... oh heck! Help me get rid of officer Lin Yun right away Why? I wouldn't let Ai Nu fall in love... with 'a man without future' Ms. Chun I used to kill those people who hurt us Then I killed for money Now... When did you get so nagging? Hurry up! C'mon, get to it Where are you going? Didn't you tell me to kill? What's wrong with Xiao Ye today? Who are you? I don't have a name What is your relation with Ai Nu? You don't need to know Why do you want to kill me? I don't know either You are a professional killer No. Killing is like a gamble with one's life The thrill to kill As a gamble would you put your life at stake? I used to. However today it's for someone else What happened? It must be related to Merryland Xiao Ye Ms. Chun Where is the sword? I lost it Did you kill Lin Yun? I did it like before Risking my life, I stabbed in his chest God knows why my sword was cast down! What? You let go of your sword? Why? I don't know either Maybe I don't want to kill the innocent Or I'm too tired and don't feel like doing anything out of weariness No interest in anything, huh? You don't want to kill. You don't want me Xiao Ye, since when did you become like this? No, not only I changed But also you did too You became selfish, cruel and greedy I became lonely, heartless and disgraceful I've never felt it before Until Ai Nu was here She looks like you when you were young I discovered that both of us... are different than what we were before Ai Nu again Let me tell you In the future... don't you ever dare mention Ai Nu! I have what Ai Nu has, right? From now on you just listen to my order Tomorrow you go and do away with Lin Yun What a cruel woman! Ai Nu Why does she need to kill Lin Yun? Why can't she stand me being with you? Didn't you say before... I look like her when Lady Chun was young? What are you doing? I'm bent on doing what Lady Chun forbid Let's see what can she do! Hey, what're you up to? I heard you mention... I look like Lady Chun when she was young Tell me How was the first time with Lady Chun? Please tell me Come on, Xiao Ye. You lay down first Don't move, okay Ms Chun... Ms Chun... Xiao Ye, Xiao Ye Ms Chun... The roses smell so good Ai Nu, Ai Nu What are you doing? Why didn't you ask me... what I was doing with him? Xiao Ye doesn't like you now But he still remembers... the first time when you both were in a bathtub Although it was me in his arms... he still kept calling out your name! He said that the roses smell good Did you just say you got everything I had? But now whatever you don't have I'll get it Why do you choose Xiao Ye? Why do you need to kill Lin Yun? I don't want you to fall in love with a loser Can't the poor have love? Ai Nu, what should I do to convince you? I'm really protecting you The reason I want Lin Yun killed... it's all for your own benefit Hey, Lady Chun Have you ever gone down on your knees? Didn't you teach me... one should have a stone heart and never begging Never cry You'll kill... to achieve the purpose From the first day you saw me... you realised that I had your personality We have the same background Even our appearance is similar Hence unknowingly you've been taking care of me If you think that you're protecting me actually it's protecting your own self Because I was you when you were young Not the one you are now Did you get it? It's not me that you're concerned for You only care about yourself That's why I always rely on you But you forgot that I've changed I'm doing what you didn't do before Maybe one day I'll leave you Please don't leave... Ai Nu I'll give you everything How about love? What? Is there such a thing called love? You don't understand? Take your time to think about it It's very windy outside How's the noodle shop outside the city? Miss, you might be mistaken I don't have anything good to offer you Uncle, do you still remember me? Are you joking? To such a small place No one like you will come About half a year back... you remember that girl squatting beside earth-god? What? A girl? Oh, I remember It was just like today An officer riding a horse happened to pass by Yes, I'm that girl Have I changed a lot? Of course You look so much more elegant and beautiful It's better than before Really? Then, you... Why? You... What happened to you? I was thinking about what you just said All of my jewellery is here You can have it I want to prove to you In my whole life... you're the only person for whom I cherish some care It's strange! Suddenly I think love isn't important anymore I like the jewellery more Lady Chun What's the matter? Nothing. I just came over to see you It's very odd I've never seen you without any make-up Yes, it has been more than ten years It was always in my mind You were protecting me with this knife Since that day You stayed with my mother and I I remembered the day my mother died It was cold like today Mom, you can't die Auntie Mom Auntie! I'm dying Both of us need to take care of each other Like brother and sister Mom... Auntie... My dear, think of something for a better life Can't carry on being bitter for a lifetime Auntie Mom That was her last sentence I remembered what she had said I aspired for a good life For the past decade or so... we had been suffering in Merryland Finally I thought that our life is getting better Actually it wasn't so Today I realise that... we missed something else What did we miss? We miss the love Love Love is like a narrow path It's only big enough for one heart We have to give up the rest The weather today is like that day when mom died It's very cold and dark The smell of losing our loved ones in air Ms. Chun, what's wrong with you? Nothing, nothing Ms. Chun Quiet... please say no more Ms. Chun Xiao Ye Xiao Ye Xiao Ye, are you satisfied? I'm sleepy, Ms. Chun. I want to take a rest All right! Take a good rest! I'm leaving I needs to leave you alone Ms. Chun... Ms. Chun, I didn't know it's you I really don't know it's you I heard some sound at the back I'm used to it I know You would attack when you heard the sound Ms. Chun I want to ask you a question You... If you know that I want to kill you what will you do? I'll never do anything Xiao Ye, Xiao Ye When did you get here? I've been here for a long time You saw everything Finally I believe it I've never loved anyone except Xiao Ye You're very silly Xiao Ye loves you always It's very ironic! I thought if I killed Xiao Ye... it would be an appropriate climax Who knew it'd be the opposite! Now on I'll have to go with Xiao Ye to netherworld Could you kiss me again... before I die? Lady Chun Lady Chun Ai Nu Yesterday there was someone after my life I found out that Lady Chun wanted me dead Would you know their whereabouts? Both of you deserved it Didn't expect this time Ai Nu would get the credit Ai Nu, Ai Nu Where could she have gone!
