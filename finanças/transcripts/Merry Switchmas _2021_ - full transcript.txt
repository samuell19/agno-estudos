Hi, how are you? Good. Please sit. Thank you so much for meeting with me. Oh sure. I'm all ears. As you may know, I'm graduating next month with my PhD in engineering, and I'm looking to leave my current position. At your father's company? Right. I want to be a part of a younger company, like yours. Ambitious, I like that. Now, why should I consider having you head up my engineering department when I have the cream of the crop, just to consider for the opening. To date, I've created 17 apps, I'm fluent in a dozen programming languages, including Pearl, C++, C, and Assembly, just to name a few. I manage my own team, I design my own programs, I create the code, and I test the software for bugs. Yes, I see that. It is impressive. But I don't think you have all the- - I understand that you are looking to create a new sensory network for energy efficiency. So I've gone ahead and created an algorithm for your company to prevent against signal loss. Oh wow. Your work is impeccable. But how do I know that this move is not the only reason that you want to work for Baxter Enterprises? Well, there is your son. Of course. Denise look, you're a lovely young lady. And the fact that you want to leave your father's company, one of my closest competitors I must add, isn't lost on me either. Miss Baxter, if I may be so bold, yes, I want to leave and spread my own wings, and yes, I want to work closely with my boyfriend, your son. More than that though, I would love to work under the tutelage of a Black woman who continues to be at the forefront of creating a woman empowered workplace. That's quite an impassioned plea, Denise. But what would my old friend Howard think about you leaving his company and coming to work for me? Honestly, he'll go ape shit. Great. Then, you can start in two weeks. Thank you so much Mrs. Baxter. You're so welcome. Now, you must let your father know, sooner than later okay? Christmas is just two days away, so I wouldn't want to blindside him during the holidays, you know? Absolutely, you won't regret this. Okay. Have a good day. All right. All right, where's the fire? Des, I need your help. Is Justin here? No, he's out with the guys. You're at about a 10, I need you to bring it down to a 4. I need you to promise me you won't say anything to anyone. - OMG, are you pregnant? - No, I'm not pregnant! If you must know, Jordan and I use birth control, thank you very much. So if you don't have a baby on board, what's the big secret then? I got a new job Damn girl, a new job aint no secret. Thought you were about to tell me something juicy. I got a job at Baxter Enterprises and I start in two weeks. Holy shit, now that's juicy. Dad's gonna flip. His baby girl and most beloved daughter is leaving the nest for his competition. I guess I'm finally gonna be dad's favorite. I am not his favorite. Oh please, you're basically his clone. He's been grooming you your entire life. Meanwhile, all I ever hear is, "Why aren't you as smart as Denise?" "Why aren't you as ambitious as Denise?" "Why don't you make yourself look as pretty as Denise does?" Des, stop it, we're identical twins, we look exactly alike. I used to think that too. Mom and dad love us both equally, dad and I just get along better 'cause we have similar interests. Similar, try the same. Sometimes I don't know if I'm the twin or dad is. And that's why I need your help. Of course dear sister, anything for you. Great, I need you to switch places with me so you can break the news as me and tell dad I'm quitting and starting a new job. Except that. Why? Niecy, you've got to learn to stand up to dad for yourself. Besides, Justin will kill me if he finds out we switched. I'm already on rocky grounds over this whole like, marriage foolishness. Well you did tell the man if ever he wants to end your relationship, all he has to do is buy you a ring. That's right, marriage is a contract for business and I refuse to be contractually obligated to love anyone. If he needs a piece of paper to prove my love, maybe I'm not the one for him. Now you're just being silly. You have a man who actually wants to marry you. Meanwhile, I can't even get mine to think about popping the question. Besides, you know you love that man. Like Tina said, what's love got to do with it? Everything. And you know men can only take so much rejection before they realize they should just find someone who wants the same thing. Please, he is not going anywhere. He loves me. You know what? I can't with you right now. You make no sense. Well that makes two of us. I can't believe I'm the one trying to talk some sense into you for a change. See? The roles have already reversed. Please Des, please. You've always been able to stand up to dad without the fear of consequence, I've never been able to do that. Plus, I can't bear to see that look of disappointment on his face. A look I've grown used to, since I've seen it many, many times. You're mom's mini-me. Creative, quick-witted, social butterfly. Everything I admire about you both, everything that I'm not. So let's be honest, you've always been her favorite. I have not. We just have similar interests, that's all. So? What do you say? Ugh, when do you want this foolishness to happen? Tomorrow? At mom and dad's annual Christmas Eve party? You're trippin', no. Des, just think about it. Everyone's gonna be drinking and celebrating and having a good time. No one's gonna be paying that close attention to us. Plus, dad won't have a chance to make a scene just in case he decides to go- He goes ape shit. Hmm, you might have a point. But why should I do this for you? Because you love your sister. And you did just say you'd do anything for me, and because you know how hard it is for me to stand up for myself, especially to dad. Plus, you'd be doing me a total solid and I'd owe you forever. Yes, you will owe me forever. So, does that mean you're gonna do it? - On two conditions. - Okay fine, name it. Number one, after this, you grow a pair and you stand up to dad moving forward. Mhmm. And number two, this is it. No more switching ever again. We're way too old for this foolishness. Promise, I swear. This is just gonna be for one night and no one will ever know. Fine, deal. But if we get caught, Niecy I'm snitchin'. We won't get caught. Get caught doing what? - Baby, hey. - Hey. You guys are too busy in here plotting, so who's getting caught doing what? That's what you get for listening in on folk's conversations. Denise was just saying that if we plan it right, we won't get caught in the snow tomorrow. Snow? I didn't hear about no snow. It was just on the news. We don't want it to ruin our dresses for the party. How bout that? I know, you hate going to it every year. No, I just hate my mom buying me an outfit to wear every year. - I think that's cute. - I think that's cute. This year's party is gonna be a good time. Might even have some unexpected revelations. Unexpected revelations, huh, well in that case, I can't wait. If you excuse me ladies, I gotta hit the showers and turn in. Really? So early? Is everything okay baby? Uh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's been a long day and I had a ton of work to do and I gotta run some errands tomorrow and take my mom out to brunch, so goodnight. Okay, well rest well. Have a good night. Hey, yeah we have a problem. I just walked in on my girl and her sister talking, I think they may be on us, man. Yeah, look, hold on. I don't know man, but I'm terrified. You swear you haven't said anything to anybody? Look man, it's getting serious around here. You seen "Snapped"? That's child's play for my girl. One second. Look, things are getting real around here. Look, I gotta call you back, I gotta figure out this brunch thing. I'll call you back. Appreciate it. Yes. - So this is it? - These are it. Oh my gosh. It's been great. Thanks so much. - I'm so excited. - Shall we? You ready to order? Um, yeah, but those two? Oh yeah, they've been coming in here for the past few months, always smiling and whispering. Never really order anything besides coffee. Cute, right? That lowdown, dirty, cheating dog. Okay, that's beginning to be a very bad habit. Des, I need to tell you something. How about you tell me that you brought everything we need in order for us to pull off this switch. I saw Justin this morning when I went to the cafe to get coffee. Yeah, okay. He was meeting his mom, so what? Did he make you in that whole get up you have on? So how upset would you be if I told you he wasn't with his mom? He was with another woman. Not at all, it's probably just a friend. I have guy friends that I- He kissed her. He's a dead man. Whoa, whoa Des, you can't go anywhere. Niecy, if you don't get out of my way right now. I'm so sorry I had to be the one to tell you. He's gonna be the one that's sorry. I knew he was acting strange lately, but cheating? The worst part, the cashier said that they'd been meeting each other there for the last few months. Uh-uh, I don't even get down like that. I mean, why? You did tell the man you'd rather be dead than married. I never thought that this could happen. I love Justin, I really love Justin. I'm just not into the whole marriage foolishness. Ugh, this is all my fault. Des, I completely understand if you don't want to do this tonight. Yeah, maybe. No, no, let's do it. This might actually be the perfect way to find out exactly what the hell is going on. Des, no, we have a plan for you to tell dad about my new job, and that's it. Says you. Here's our new plan. I'm gonna have your big talk with dad, and you're gonna find out if Justin is really cheating on me, and who with. Otherwise, I'm out, got it? Got it. Nice of you to join us Jordan. Sorry, I got caught up. You're only seven minutes late. It's just brunch bro, chill. You remind me of your father, god rest his soul. However Jordan, you know how I feel about promptness. To be early is to be on time and to be one time is to be late. And to be late is unacceptable, yes mother, I know but it is the holidays y'all. Can y'all just chill for one day, please. You see mother, this is what I'm talking about. Here we go, water boy, always trying to kiss up to mom's favor, stop that please. I would slap you, but that's animal abuse. I'ma kick your ass if you keep messing with me. - Try it. - Please boys, enough. Now listen, I've arranged for two amazing realtors to meet with you both next week. She's gonna show you properties, now is the best time to buy. We discussed this already. Yeah, we're grown men, we do not need you to run our lives. Where's the chocolate milk? Why they don't have that on the menu? I'm not trying to run your lives, I'm only trying to help you. Mom, I told you, I want to wait 'til I'm engaged or married to buy a new place. Fine. Jordan, did you hear that I offered Denise a position with our company? I did, I think she's gonna do great. That girl wants to be all up on you all the time. But that's okay, I'm gonna keep my good eye on her. That's why you hired her? Keep your good eye on her? No, of course not. She's very talented. And besides, this will give me the opportunity to snag her from our fierce competition. You know, eventually you two will be running the family business. And I don't just want you prepared, I want the women on your arm's prepared as well. You're the only family I have, not since your dad. - We know. - We know. So anyway, let's just chill out and relax like Jordan said. Yes please. And order some food. He's gonna have the frosted French toast, and he'll have the eggs benedict. I can't have frosted anything, I am lactose, this woman should know that, she is my mother if you did not know. This is my brother here, he's special, he'll take a kids menu and a box of crayons. He will have a bowl of breath mints. What I mentioned, thank you dear. You can get him the kid's menu. I was holding my breath the whole time. Come on, stop playing. Excuse me, what I said. Okay, thank you. Yes ma'am. I'm lactose, I can't have frosted nothing. Coffee please? Black. You didn't even know I was lactose, I'm your son. Just so we're clear, if we're not successful with this, our boyfriends will break up with us. And our parents will disown us. We're gonna have to be careful and plan this thing down to the smallest detail. I'm with it, so let's get to work. Outfits. Check. Shoes? Check. Hair, makeup, and jewelry. Check, check, check. Operation Merry Switchmas is going down. Yeah. So, what do you think? Wow, we really did it. Yes, we did. Now, just a couple of reminders to bring it all home. Remember, I always scratch- Your nose when you're nervous. And remember, I always pat- Your leg when you get anxious. And, you always look around when you're not entirely being truthful. Both true. Here's the thing, mom and dad are gonna be the toughest to fool, but we know their routine at the party. So how do we pull this thing off? First, we have to make it past their usually greeting. My beautiful daughters! More like a TSA inspection. Mom will look us up and down making sure we're just perfect for the Christmas photo. This will be the hardest part. I think now we're ready for a family photo, right baby? Yes. Come on. All we have to do is stay cool and avoid eye contact. Once we make it past her, the rest of the evening will be piece of cake. You guys know the drill. Desiree on my left, Denise on my right, hubby at the end. After that, the house will get packed with glee, which will work in our favor. Here we go. Let's start with a little Vogue first, very Vogue, one, two, three, Vogue. We need to remember the quick routes in and out of each room like we did when we were kids. We can use the guests to help distract them from our true identities. We need to always have our eyes and ears on mom, dad, and our boyfriends. Let's act crazy, one, two, three, reindeer! Last one, a little smize. Shush, smize for me one, two, three smize. Wonderful! Speaking of boyfriends, we need to set some rules. No sappy looks, no touching, and definitely no making out. Absolutely no making out. We need to be as indistinguishable as possible to everyone, especially the guys. What? I said no touching. A hug is touching, he's seeing me, not you, remember? So stop it. - The party's this way. - Sure. That reminds me, we need a clear line of communication for the party. We can each wear an ear pod, so that way if we need to make a quick call, no one can tell we're actually on the phone. Perfect. Now in order for this to work, we need to isolate dad so you can break the news to him. That's nearly impossible. Mom is always by his side at the party. Except when mom excuses herself into the kitchen to hide- - Aunt Millie's special fruitcake. Perfect, that will give you at least five minutes to tell dad about the job. Can you make that work? It's as good as done. After you break the news to dad- - And after you find out if Justin is cheating. You will learn if Justin has truly been faithful. And you dear sister, will be the new lead engineer for Baxter Enterprises. And you will forever be my hero. All right, here we go. We got this. You girls look lovely, and I will see you at the tree. Wait a minute. Hmm. Girls. Do you have anything to say for yourselves. Mom. We need to tell you- - You're welcome, just a few minor adjustments and you ladies look picture perfect. Let's go. Honey, we're ready. Okay Desiree left, Denise right, I'll be there, okay good. Okay, Vogue first, and on three, one, two, three, Vogue. Next one, one, two, three, crazy. One, two, three, crazy. Last one, smizing, one, two, three, smize. I love you guys, see you in a bit. Okay, I've got the parentals, you take the guys when they arrive. They should've been here by now. What do I until then? CP time wasn't factored into the equation. Don't panic, that's you. Just roll with it, that's me. You're me now, so act like me. Fun and lively. Right. Fun and lively. And you, be nerdy and anxious. - Okay. - Okay. Mrs. Baxter, happy holidays, thanks for coming. Sure. Justin, hey! Not in front of everyone silly. So did your sister tell you her good news? She did, and I know she's very excited about it too, very excited. Oh good, I'm excited to be getting her. Just the thought of snagging her right from under your father, gives me goosebumps. Has she broken the news to him yet? Not yet, but I'm sure she will. Well, I hope she does it soon because I would hate to have too many holiday drinks and for it to accidentally slip out, you know, before she gets the chance to tell him. Oh great, Bailey's here. I don't know why you keep insisting on inviting that woman to our party every year. I just- I know she can be a bit much, but Bailey's an old friend. More importantly, she's the mother of both our daughter's boyfriends. True, but she is just so. - Coleen. - I know, you're right, you're right, right. And for the sake of our daughters, I will do my best as always to be gracious and pleasant. But I'm not making any promises. - You can do this. - I can do this. Bailey, good to see you, and both of you. Howie, Colleen. I brought some champaign to keep the party going. Ah, thank you, that's very kind of you... - Justin. - Of course, Justin. I'm sorry, you and your brother, it's as hard to tell apart as our twins. - Of course. - Could you do me a favor and put those over on the cocktail table? Sure, I guess I'll leave. Thank you. Justin is such a lovely adult, considering. So is Desiree, considering. All right, let's not start ladies. Start what Howie? How long have we been annoying each other now? As long as we've been married. Oh no, it's been way longer than that. I've known Howard before you even came along dear. The only dear that I see are the reindeer on my front lawn. Well if the retinol fits. - You know what- - Okay, okay, ladies, that's enough, please, no one wants to get on Santa's naughty list this year. Howard. Naughty list? Bailey... Did you ring the bell baby? Actually, I couldn't reach it. Could I impose on you to do it. You can impose on me to do a whole lot of things for your fine self. How about we get naughty together tonight and save Santa the trip? Hello! Come on in. It's cold out there, quickly, quickly. Aunt Mildred, honey I see that you've met our new neighbor, Mr. Terrell Nolan. I sure did. I think he's feeling me, and if he's single, I definitely want to feel all over him. Yes, he is single. But I think he may be here to meet someone else. Uh, who here hotter than me Colleen? Who? You know what? No one Aunt Mildred. That's right. Besides, I'm trying to jingle somebody bells tonight. Merry Christmas everyone! Mr. Nolan, we are so glad you came. Please forgive my Aunt Mildred. Please, call me Terrell, and she's harmless. Terrell, if only that were true. Well I am so glad to get the invite, and I'm still trying to learn all of the neighbors around here. Well you are in luck because most of these people are here tonight. Well great, I didn't know how many guests you were expecting, so I brought the whole box. Yes, I'm so sorry, thank you so much. Now, if you wouldn't mind putting that over there, that would be great. Okay. Thank you so much. Honey, I guess you don't see me standing here. My arm's gonna fall off carrying this. Let me take that from you Aunt Mildred. Yes, so good. So good of you to make it. And Aunt Mildred, it is always a blessing to have you here with us. Yes, it sure is. Yes dear. Well damn, you both make it sound like I should be dead by now. Be a sugar plum and put up my favorite fruitcake until it's time for dessert, and I added some extra rum to the dish. You shouldn't have. You really shouldn't have. Oh hub bub, my mama raised me right. I never go anywhere empty handed. How lucky for us, Howard? Yes, excuse me. Aunt Mildred please, allow me the honor of escorting you to your favorite chair. Of course Okay. Whatchu doing? Oh! Desiree. You scared the mistletoe out of me. I'm sorry mom, I came in here to get Aunt Millie the virgin? Oh god bless you. Oh honey, and if could put this awful fruitcake somewhere while you're at it. Okay. How's right here? Perfect. - All done. - Thank you baby. You know, you have always been my little helper. And partner in crime. You know what, I'm not gonna admit this under oath but I am so glad you and I are close. Even though your father and I do not have favorites. Of course not. I just feel that your sister and I just don't have a connection like we do. Really? I've always felt that she's been disappointed in me for being a simple old housewife. I don't think she feels that way at all, mom. Maybe it just seems like that because she has more in common with dad. Yeah, she's always been a career girl that I've never been. I think I embarrass her. Yeah. What? No way mom. How do you think she became so orderly and well functioning? She learned that from you, watching you run this household. I mean, when dad was first starting his business, not only did you have to raise twin girls, but you acted as his receptionist and his accountant. If anything, I think Denise is probably the one that's embarrassed. She probably feels like she could never be as good as you are, managing so many things, especially your cooking skills. But she's had everything I've had. And I just think you know, she just hasn't been in a position to utilize them yet. I don't know, you really think she's had them? Absolutely. Well, maybe not the cooking skills though. Your father and I, we have the best girls ever. And I just you know, in some ways, I just think that we each got our very own girl. Is that a terrible thing to say? No mom, it's not. Well, as you've gotten older however, I want to have the same relationship with your sister too. I think she would really love the same thing. Really? When you see Aunt Mildred, and if she says anything about not tasting enough rum, just tell her that she lost her taste buds years ago. She did? No, but she's not gonna remember that anyway. Thank you darlin'. Thanks mom. Can you marry me? Stop saying can. You can do this. Oh gosh, I'm so nervous. Hey, how you doing? Hey, what was that for? No kissing, or touching, or making out during the party. Where is this coming from? I just want our passion to build up so we can ravage each other later. What is? What? Um, I mean, I really want to smash tonight. Speaking of smashing, are you happy with the way our relationship is going? Well this is an odd transition, and a weird thing to ask. God damn it, come one. One in the random acts of flyness is this? No, I told you not to wear the suit that mom bought us. Me? You need to change. I look kinda fresh. The fact that you said fresh makes you look all the more ridiculous. Besides, mom said I look good in it, so. Mom said this suit was made just for me. You guys know you are identical, right? We don't. You're not even wearing it right. Look, you gotta pull this up, pull this down, wipe the makeup off your face. We'll be right back. We have a problem. Damn right we do. I don't plan on looking like you all night long. Oh? I gotta tell you something. What? I kissed Denise. What, come again? I don't think I heard you. That wasn't Desiree I was with, that was with Denise. Are you sure? Positive, I know my girl. Whenever I kiss my girl, she has that little smirk at the end, wasn't there. Why would they switch? I don't know. Do you think they saw you with Melanie right before brunch? I don't see how, I was super careful when I met with her. Okay, how was she? Melanie, she was the best. I was nervous at first but she made me feel real comfortable. I know my girl, she'll take care of you. So you're sure no one saw you two? All I did was give her a hug and a kiss on the cheek. There it is. Hug, kiss on the cheek. How much you want to bet that Desiree followed you and saw you somehow? So you think Desiree knows? Crazy Desiree? Hell yes she knows. She probably thinks you're cheating right now. - That would be awesome. - Yeah, huh? Well let's see. So here it is. - This is it? - Mhmm. Sheesh. Bro, y'all did y'all thing. Melanie was right, she is the number one custom jeweler in Chicago. Wow. Meeting up with Melanie was a risk but it totally worked out. So, what do you think the girls are up to? I have no idea. But I say we trip them up a little bit, you know? Change a couple things about these suits. So I'll be you and you'll be me? Well sort of. Bro, I don't know man. I wanted tonight to be special. And it will be, I promise. But I'm not suggesting we do the same, but we should have a little fun. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay I'm in. But anything goes wrong, I'm pulling the plug. Agreed. - All right. - Cool. Give me something. You know what, none of that corny shit man. Jordan. All right, let's do this. Take these glasses here, be super careful with them please. You acting like a lame. Hey, everything okay baby girl? Baby girl. Yes dad everything's fine. I just wanted to tell you- Actually, I'm glad we have a moment to ourselves 'cause there's something I need to tell you. Dad, I really need to tell you that I've been thinking about it a lot- - You know that I love you and your sister equally. Yes dad, I know. I'd be lying if I said you don't hold a special place in my heart. Go on. You have brought so much meaning to my life, and especially my work. Following in the footsteps of dear old dad. Well, you know I've always looked up to you daddy. Legacy. See that's why it's been so important to me that you're working with me in the company that I built. And I want to show you all the ins and outs in the hopes that one day, you'll take over the business for yourself. Now I know that you kids today, you're used to getting everything so quickly, but if you just be patient, stick with me a few more years until you grasp every aspect of the operation and I'll be able to rest easy when the time comes to hand it all over to you. What about Desiree? Oh come on, you know how your sister is. She wants nothing to do with me, she's never been interested in the family business. I don't think that's true at all. Maybe she just felt like there was never a place for her with you. Maybe. I don't know. I'm not creative. And I've never really felt like I could relate to her. You may be corporate, but you have creative departments, like marketing and media. We all have some balance of corporate and creative inside of us. So maybe you can think of her in terms like that. Yeah, you are absolutely right Denise, thank you. Now getting back to what I was saying. I appreciate that you have been working so hard with me while simultaneously working on your PhD. I want you to know that your efforts have not gone unnoticed. And that is why I'm going to promote you to Executive Director of Engineering. Really? Yes. Dad, that's great. Look, I'm sorry I was so excited I had to go first, but I didn't forget that you said you had something you wanted to share with me as well, so what was it? Um, you see, well, what happened was... I just,. I just wanted to say that it's been great working with you and getting to know you even better. Aw, thank you baby girl. Can't wait to tell your mother the good news. No, dad, wait! Young man, could you please be a dear and pour me a fresh glass of that eggnog? Mmm. Yes, time flies when you're having rum, mmm-mmm. There you are! Yay! Time to celebrate. Don't throw anything back just yet. I didn't tell dad. What do you mean? What happened? Dad happened. I'm sorry Niecy I tried. But he was so nice. He's always nice to me. Yeah but, he's never nice to me like that, and because he thought I was you, he was even nice when he spoke about me. By the way, he's giving you a promotion. What? Wait, what? This is not happening right now. It's already happening. He rushed out to go tell mom. None of this is going according to plan. First Justin, and now this? Justin? What happened with Justin? He kinda kissed me. Hold up, so the person cheating on me is you? No silly, he kissed you but obviously, I'm you. He came from behind me, spun me around and then just planted one on me. I mean, who does that type of thing? My man does that kind of thing. So what did you do? I sort of smacked him? What? OMG. He and Jordan are wearing the exact same suit so now they really look- Identical. - This is not good. - Not good at all. Justin said that he's not really happy with the way our, well, with the way your relationship is going. He said that? I'm losing my man? Damn Des, what are we gonna do? You gotta clear things up with Justin and I gotta go tell dad before Miss Baxter does. She wouldn't. She very much would. I'm starting to think this whole thing may be a big mistake after all. What am I gonna do? Don't look at me, I'm just as confused as you are. We better pray. Coleen, lovely party as always. Thank you Bailey, I'm so glad your family could join us. You know, I'm surprised you didn't have one of your black tie events to attend to tonight. I did, but I declined. I wouldn't dare miss one of Howard's events. Mine and Howard's event. Of course, Freudian slip. - You know what? How about I- - Ladies, how is everyone enjoying the party? Just splendid Howard. I was just telling your wife that I wouldn't dare miss a chance of all of us being under the same roof. Let me tell you, Bailey, don't start. I'm just saying my boys are dating your girls, so it's nice for us to share family moments together. We love your boys, and they're always welcome here. And you know how I feel about the girls, I love them too. Especially that Denise. Beautiful, intelligent, and ambitious. That girl's really going places. Yes she is. Absolutely, one day she will be CEO of Dodson Industries. And what's so funny about that? Well is that your dream or hers? Are you implying that we're forcing the family business on our daughter? Oh no, I would never imply that. But if I'm driving down your street and happen to pass your house. - You pompous- - Wait, wait, now Bailey, Coleen and I are very proud of our daughters, but we have always let them be free to make their own choices and decisions, apart from us and from each other. Now I don't think the same could be said about your sons. Grown sons that you insist on still dressing in matching Christmas outfits. I think it's lovely, and besides, they love it. Do they? Or do you love it? I have no idea what you are implying. I'm not implying anything, but if I happen to drive down your street, and pass by your house, I'll be sure to honk, beep, beep. Stealing from me again Howard, I see? Oh. Ladies. Gentlemen. Desiree you look amazing. Thanks. Denise, fantastic. As do you. Mhmm, this eggnog is the truth. Already seeing double. Why do I feel like I'm stuck in a "Sister Sister" episode? Jordan. Jordan? Yes baby. I'm sure glad you guys fixed your suits, now you look like your usual selves. Yeah, you know, I can't look like Black Hogwarts over there. I don't know what you're talking about, my man looks good okay? And he's wearing the hell out of that suit. Thank you my love. Of course baby. Don't you all look handsome together. Now this is the Christmas card photo op right here. Glad I picked those suits out this morning. Well, speaking of this morning, where did you go for brunch. - Ooh. - Ooh. Well we all went to our favorite little spot, Dorothy's Cafe. Oh, lovely. And around what time was that? Uh, mom. Desiree, you and your sister will go on plenty of brunch dates with us, you need not worry about that. Jordan, let's get the ladies some of that. Of course. I'm not worried about it. But he should be. Aunt Mildred, now you know you're not supposed to have any alcohol. Who said? I said. Colleen, I'm a grown woman and I can handle a little taste of champagne. Alright, one glass. But that is it. You promise me. Promise me. I promise. I'm watching you. I'm having a flashback of our other fiascos. The new plan is, there is no plan. I mean, I'm a grown woman, I should be able to look my father in the eye and say, "Dad, I am leaving Dodson Industries" to go to Baxter Enterprises." Yes, you should. Great, I'm gonna do just that. Fabulous. Three, two, one. I can't. I knew you couldn't. No I can't because I'm you and you're me. If I'm gonna do this than I have to do it as the real me. My girl, look at you growing a pair. I know, right? It kinda feels liberating. Before we switch back, are you absolutely sure? Because we can still pull this thing off. I am. Des, this whole thing has been way too stressful. Plus, I really think I can do it. Then let's switch back now. Okay, help me with this zipper. Oh sorry, I am not looking, I am not looking but peek-a-boo. Jordan, what are you doing? Is everything okay? Um, I just really need to talk to you. Could you just give us like, 20 minutes? We'll be right out. I'm sorry, but this really can't wait. Can you excuse us? What's so urgent? And why are you looking outside the door? I'm just making sure Desiree can't hear us. Oh really, and why is that? I know we're twins and we tell each other everything, but you gotta promise me you won't say anything to your sister. I absolutely promise I will not tell Desiree. Okay, I think Justin is cheating on your sister. Come again? I mean, why would you think that my love? Remember when my mom asked him about brunch? Yes? Well, he wasn't with us the entire time. Oh really? Where was he? He met some chick a few weeks ago, business deal. But he's with her every single time, like, every night. And you're just now telling me? I didn't think it was a big deal, I thought it was just business. But now I'm thinking it's something serious. I'm going to kill him. Hey look, I get it, I'm upset with him too, but no need for violence. That's easy for you to say, he's not cheating on you. Nor you, so you can't say anything. They'll sort themselves out. You're kidding, you think I'm just gonna stand by and let your brother betray my trust? Don't you mean your sister's trust? We're identical twins, our trust is one and the same. I hate to admit it but I kinda saw this coming. What are you talking about? Look at them, they don't have what we have. Yes, your sister loves him but she don't want a real commitment. It's best it goes this way. That's not true, this is not best for them. Desiree is committed to him. Yeah, all on her terms. My brother may act fine with it but he's a romantic. Fresh hairline, handsome, he wants kids, marriage, the whole shebang. Your sister thinks that's kinda whack. Not whack, just not for her. Like a silly fairytale maybe. Exactly, like a silly fairytale. My brother wants the happily ever after. You're right, maybe I should go tell her. No, I'll tell her. She should hear it from me. Glad to hear that business is going so well for you. Your company has come a long way since- - Since I left yours and my dearly departed husband started our own, yes it has. And I have you to thank for that. No thanks necessary. I wasn't actually thanking you. You were just the catalyst for my departure. Well, you said you needed to get out of the boat and go your own way. What else was I supposed to say? I'm still in love with you? Working with you every day was torture. Bailey, our college years were way behind us. I had moved on and married an amazing woman. You had moved on and married William. I know his death has been extremely difficult for you. More than you'd like to admit. But you still have two amazing sons by him to cherish. You've always been a perfect gentleman, which makes it even worse. But yes, we both have moved on. But I've never forgotten. Forgotten what? Howard, has your wife forgotten that I knew you first? How could I with the constant reminders? - Colleen honey- - No, I got it this time, Howard. You see, I've allowed my husband to manage this relationship because it is his responsibility to, but you continue to push. See, we both tolerate it because despite that, we see the good in you, and your sons, and all the things you've accomplished. But let me make one thing perfectly clear, you are the ex-girlfriend from college, I am his wife for the rest of his life. Are we clear? Crystal. Great. Have some more eggnog. I would, if you had better rum. Enjoy the party. - Oh hey. - Hey. - How are you? - Good. Well I think your sister is gonna do great at my mom's company. Yeah, she's really pumped about it but you know how anxious she can get about things. She plans on telling our dad tonight. Tonight? Wow, that's huge. I'll say a prayer for her strength. Boy, does she need it I think she might be having second thoughts about the whole thing. Second thoughts? She should, I mean, you know, I don't even think my brother wants her working there. Doesn't want her working there? - I mean- - Did he say that? Those were not his exact words, it was more like, a concern. How he's going to manage his mother and his girlfriend all at the same place. Oh. I guess I never thought that it was such a conflict for him. I thought he loved the idea of them working together. He does, I mean, how do I know? Hey, look, whatever decision she makes, it will be the right one. From your lips to baby Jesus's ears. You know, when people are ready to change, they'll change, and they'll never do until then. Sometimes people just need the right reasons to change, right? True. You were my reason to change, to be less selfish, to make you a priority, spend all my time only with you. And I was totally worth it, right? Yes you were. And I can no longer pretend being companions is just okay. I want more. Jordan. It's time to go. I've grown tired of this holiday party. I'm not Jordan, I'm Justin. Boy, I birthed you, I know who you are. Mom, I'm Justin, see? Mrs. Baxter, this is Justin, see? Yeah, mhmm. I think you had a little bit too much of the eggnog. I had a bit too much of this- - Yes. - I don't even know. Let's get you a nice big cup of coffee, shall we? That's just between my, I know you better keep. Boy, come on let's go, I'm tired- - A naughty nog, a naughty nog always gets her. Mom, the cookies right over here, let's get you some bread. Go Millie, go Millie, go Millie, go Millie, go Millie, go Millie, go Millie, go Millie, go Millie. - Go Millie, go Millie. - Millie yes! Come on Millie, go Millie, go Millie, go Millie. Jingle yourself right down here, come on baby, come on. Okay. Whoo, I think I jingled all the balls out of here. I'm so glad you have the Christmas spirit. Yes, actually I think someone got a little too into the Christmas spirits. Well I think someone is trying to get on Mr. Kringle's nice list. Yes, actually, I want to get on Mrs. Kringle's naughty list. Oh Howard, yum. You're on my list every year. And even when I forget to say it, thank you. For what? For loving me, for being my rock. If you hadn't taken care of things at home the way you do, there's no way I could've gone out into that crazy world, and built a successful business. You are so welcome my love. I'm just thankful that I was able to do what I could you know, to get you started. Stay home and raise our beautiful girls. Yes. You have provided a beautiful life for all of us and I am so proud of you, and our girls. Speaking of our girls. I miss all of us being together as a family. Yup. I'm usually out with Denise and you're with Desiree, and actually I have a confession to make. What's that? It may not be obvious, but I secretly favor Denise. No, really? Not obvious at all. Oh it's that bad? It's okay baby, I've done the same thing with Desiree. But I'm telling you, this year, all of that is gonna stop, it's gonna stop. I'm gonna make amends and give each of our girls the equal attention that they deserve. - Wow. - Yeah. I decided to the exact same thing. - Really? - Yes. Yes. Should we go tell them together? No, 'cause I think this is the very time that we owe them one-on-one time. I agree. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Good, makes me so happy. - Me too baby. Love of my life, come on let's go and gets some cocktails. Yes. Oh. Mhmm. So, everything went according to plan on my end, I told Denise not to take the job with mom, and your dirty laundry, what about you? I planted the seed of cheating with Desiree with Denise, and she totally bought it. Hey man, that's awesome. I cannot wait to see their faces when we bust them. Speaking of busting, mom almost busted us. - That's not good man. - Yeah, relax bro. I told her spidey senses were off due to one too many holiday spirits, you know how she gets. I can't relax. I'm feeling bad about this whole thing. Don't do that. Now don't do that. You know they started this first. We just have to follow through with it. Yeah but, when I told her about the cheating, she was really hurt. I honestly, I know it's just supposed to be a joke like haha but I don't want to hurt either of them. I don't either. But we're almost at the end of the night. They'll come clean, and then we'll come clean. I hope it's as easy as you say it is. Bro, this is the big finish. All we have to do is bring it on home. Really. I'ma finish this cookie, you want anything? No, I'm good. What happened? Justin is seeing someone else. Jordan just told me thinking he was confiding in you. Thinking I was you, Justin told me that he wants to reevaluate your relationship. This officially is the worst switch ever. I'm so sorry sis. It's not your fault, it's mine. He really wants marriage and a family, and I've been so selfish thinking only about what I wanted. Wow. I guess all Justin wanted was a happy ending, no pun intended. Let's hurry up and switch so I can deal with this bad news as my true self. And I can finally face dad as my true self. Operation Merry Switchmas. Abort mission. Mom? I have been looking for you everywhere. What are you two doing? Nothing. I need to speak to Denise alone. Not again. Niecy, honey why are you leaving? I just said I need to speak to you. Oh right, silly me. I'm sorry, my mind is all over the place right now. Denise, Desiree, you know. Okay, you two have been acting awfully strange tonight. What's going on. Nothing. We're all good. Okay, Des, I need to speak to her for a few minutes please. But we were just about to, going. Thank you. I'm sorry dad. It's okay, I was just looking for your mother. Oh, she's in the bedroom with Denise. Is Denise okay? Yeah, they're fine, they just needed a minute to catch up. Well, when she comes out, let her know I'm looking for her. Actually, there's something I need to say to you. Yeah, what's up? Is everything okay mom? That is a loaded question tonight. No, everything is fine. I just, I just need a moment to talk to you for a little bit. Okay. I want to apologize to you. Oh mom, wait a minute. Can we maybe have this talk tomorrow? I'm not really feeling like my usual self right now. Honey please, just let me get this out okay? I have prided myself on being a great mother and a great role model for the both of you girls. But I realize I may have only been that to your sister. No mom, you're an amazing mother. Honey, if that was true you and I would have the same relationship your sister and I have. Why would we? Because we're identical twins? We may look identical but we have different personalities. I owe you an apology. You know dad, can this wait 'til tomorrow 'cause I'm not quite feeling like myself. No, I need to say this now. I've been a terrible father. You've been great dad. Let me finish Desiree. Now, I know we've had our ups and downs and we rarely see eye to eye, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I love you dearly. I know that. I know I'm not as close to you as Denise but it's okay. No, it's not okay. I haven't been the kind of father to you that I've been to your sister. But I just haven't embraced your differences. You've always been more of a daddy's girl, and I let you be that. And that was wrong of me. Mom, I have learned everything about being a woman, a good Christian, and overall good person from you. Not dad. I look up to you so much, I may have always been dad's favorite but mom, you've always been mine. Dad, I know it's not like what you and Denise have, but I've always felt loved by you. Sure, I may get, I mean she, she may get the best version of you, but the version I get is still pretty great. Desiree, can you ever forgive me? Of course daddy. Now I may not be as open and imaginative as you are, but I'm willing to give it a try. So you willing to let your old man learn some new things? I would love that. We can start with something simple like you come with me to one of my shoots and watch me work my magic. Okay. Or, you can allow me to style you for you and mom's upcoming anniversary party. I'm thinking casual daddy chic? Casual daddy chic? I don't know how that's gonna turn out but I'm willing to give it a try. Okay. Want to go for some naughty nog? - Yeah, let's do it. - All right. Really? Really. How did I not know that? Well, I always thought you already knew. I always tried to be just like you, I just couldn't really get it right. You don't have to be just like me, you're already better than me. You say that, but have you seen me in the kitchen? Yes I have. Honey, if cooking is what you want to learn, I'd be more than happy to teach you. I would love that. Great. You and me? Just you and me. I love you mom. I love you baby. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, I'll see you downstairs? - Okay. - Okay. Now I know I gave Colleen my fruitcake. What the hell she do with my fruitcake? Mhmm. I know what she did, she must, she must be trying to keep it all for herself again. I bet you that heifer stole my damn wig, I bet you she stole my wig. I can't find my damn fruitcake and she stole my damn wig. There's my baby, yes. Come to mama. Did she put my wig in there? You're pretty, you're so pretty. Aunt Mildred! Aunt Mildred, are you okay? Oh Lord, am I dead? No, you're not dead. Well then I guess I'm okay. All right then, let's get her in the other room. Just wanted a slice of my fruitcake. All right, here's a step, here's a step, here's a step, one step, here we go, you got one more step. There you go, okay come here. A few more steps. Get her over to the couch. Okay baby. Come on. Aunt Millie, are you okay? Good girl. Thank you baby. I don't understand. Why my fruitcake was put away so high up on a shelf. We didn't want anyone to get to it before we were ready to serve it. Ah, 'cause it's so good. No, because we hate it. Colleen! No, Howard I can't take one more thing tonight. Aunt Mildred, we hate your fruitcake. There, I said it. I can't go one more moment pretending about anything anymore. Things have got to change, starting now. Aunt Mildred, no more fruitcake. Bailey, where you at? No more drama. And girls, no more favorites. Tonight, this family is gonna start a new tradition. A tradition of love, and honor, and truth in all things in our lives, are we good? Mhmm, okay. No, now that's a tradition I can get behind. Thank you. Everyone, can I have your attention please. Mrs. Dodson, I would like you join you in that tradition. My love. - Jordan honey- - Would you hold this? What are you doing? My love. What is happening right now? From the moment I saw you, I knew that I would want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me? Excuse me, I'm sorry to break up this wonderful moment but you can't propose to her. Babe, I know you don't believe in marriages but your sister does, let them have their moment. No, you don't understand. I'm sorry, I think she had a little bit too much to drink tonight. Who snitched on me? Snitches get stitches. He can't propose to her 'cause that's not Denise. I'm Denise. What? This party is getting better and better. You two need to explain yourselves right now. Mom, dad. We didn't think anybody would know the difference and it was only for tonight. So that heart-to-heart. It was really me. And the one I thought I had with Desiree was? Me. If it helps, we told each other what you said. So sweet. No, it doesn't. Why would you fool us like that? It was my idea. No, it was my idea. Really Denise? I'm sorry dad. That look right there is exactly what I was trying to avoid. You see, Mrs. Baxter offered me a position to head up her engineering department. - You know- - But I didn't know how to tell dad and risk breaking his heart so I asked Desiree to switch with me so she could tell you instead dad. And I went along with it because I thought Justin was cheating on me. So I asked Denise if she would try and find out if it was true. And what exactly did you two think would come of this charade of yours? Mrs. Baxter, I love that you see enough in me to manage your entire department. Dad, I know that you really want me to take over the family business one day. And I love that you trust me that much. But my mind is made up. Denise, I know this move must be very hard for you but it is my pleasure to have you work at Baxter Enterprises, where you'll be your very own boss. Thank you so much Mrs. Baxter, I'm really glad to hear that. Unfortunately, I won't be able to accept the position. Oh thank you Jesus. I had really good intentions for this evening, but tonight has shown me that I have a lot more growing up to do. Before I can be anyone else's boss, I have to first become my own. Desiree, do you have anything you want to say for yourself? Huh? Desiree. Mom, dad, I thought a traditional marriage like yours wasn't for me so I fought against it. And I fought so hard that I pushed Justin away. I needed to know if I had lost him for good. I can't believe the two of you. Especially you Denise. How can I trust you to run my company one day when I can't even trust you to discuss important business issues with me? Your mother and I expect more of you, both of you. Clearly, things need to change. Yeah, like your father said, in light of what's happened tonight, things need to change. Mom, dad, I'm so sorry. I understand if you no longer want me working at the family business, I don't deserve to be. And I'm sorry too. I never wanted to betray your trust. I take whatever punishment you see fit. Desiree, Denise, I'm extremely disappointed. Dad. Just let me finish. More than anything, I'm disappointed in myself. I created a relationship where one of my daughters is afraid to be honest with me and the other feels like she's second fiddle. I love you both equally. I'm responsible for all of this. I'm sorry that I put you in a position where you felt like you had to switch. Me too. I mean, even though you're both identical twins, you each have your own individual uniqueness. From now on, we are going to embrace those differences instead of shying away from it. Thank you guys. Now Denise, there's no place I would rather have you working than with me at the office. But the choice is yours. And as for that promotion. Don't worry about it dad. I want to earn it back, along with your trust. We're really sorry for deceiving you, and everyone else tonight. We both promise, this will never happen again. Never happen again. I think we can all promise as a family that from this day forward, we will be our true selves, okay? Yeah. All right, come here. - Thanks dad. - Love you baby. Thanks mom. - Never do that again. - Okay dad, I'm sorry. You heard that, don't ever do that again, don't ever. Okay. Colleen wait. Howard, boys, ladies. I want you all to hear this too. Colleen I owe you an apology. I'm sorry for the way I've been behaving lately. After William passed away, I wasn't prepared to deal with his sudden death, nor being a widow. I was alone. And there was a void in the shape of my husband that I filled with snarky remarks and endless work. And most embarrassingly, shameless flirting with an old college boyfriend. And for that, I owe you both an apology. I'm so sorry. It will never happen again. And boys, I owe you an apology as well. I miss your dad. And you were all I had so I thought I had to hold on to you for fear of losing you too. But now I know that that was wrong. You two are grown men and I need to treat you as such. And that changes right here, right now. I love you both so much. And lastly Denise, I'm so sorry for using you as a pawn against your father. You are an exceptional engineer and I only wish that I could have had a chance to have you work for Baxter Enterprises. As for you and Desiree, I couldn't think of two lovelier young women that I would want to date my sons. That was, I'm so sorry. That was a lot to get out. I've been a real maniac. Could you all ever forgive me? Bailey, I'd like you to meet Terrell Nolan. New neighbor, he just moved up the street from our house. Recently divorced and owns his own medical practice. Well it's a pleasure to meet you Terrell. The pleasure's all mine. Justin, I'm so sorry. I was so against marriage but when my sister said she saw you in the cafe kissing another woman, I thought maybe you found someone who wasn't. And then when Jordan got down on one knee and proposed to me thinking I was really Denise, I realized, I do want to be married. That was Melanie, who specialized in engagement rings. I'll ask again, will you marry me? Duh Jordan, keep up. I'm not really Denise remember? Yes, I do remember. And I'm not Jordan, I'm Justin. Wait, so if you're him and he's you, then... But how did you both know? I figured it out after I kissed your sister. So Jordan and I pretended to switch as well. So you really do know who you're asking to marry? I do, and I'm about to ask a third time. Will you marry me? Yes, I'll marry you. ♪ I miss this ♪ I wish this time could slow down ♪ ♪ What is it about Christmas ♪ It's got the whole town ♪ Looking for a reason Jordan. I'm so sorry, I promise I'll never do anything like that again. I'll accept that apology on one condition. Anything, I'll do anything. Denise, will you marry me? What? You know I did not come all this way to watch Aunt Mildred eat fruitcake. Will you? Yes. My babies getting married, oh my god, double wedding. Oh it really is a merry Christmas. - Oh merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas everybody. Oh my gosh yay! Let me see that ring, get that ring out. Let me see, let me see. Oh! Yes. Yes, yes, yes, and yes. Voila! I'm getting married! Congratulations. Congratulations sister. Congratulations. Well? We almost lost our parents. And our boyfriends.
