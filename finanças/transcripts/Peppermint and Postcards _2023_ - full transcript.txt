Uh, finally! - So good to be here. - Um, uh, please, come in, make yourselves at home. - Thank you for all this. It's-it's gonna be a terrific Christmas. - Oh, we are one big family now. - Come see the decorations! - What do you think? - Wow, your home looks beautiful. - This is even more sparkly in real life! - Congratulations, again. - Thank you. - Yeah. - And we made this for you. - It's to help you get to know us. - Mom said we can add things that you like, too. - Hold on, guys, where's the tree? Is Christmas off? Do we need to return all your presents from Europe? - We were waiting for you two. - Oh. - Mom says Suzy's never been to choose a Christmas tree. - We have them delivered in Paris. - Well, we're gonna need some gloves and rope for the car. - I'm sorry. I don't think there's time for a coffee or a sit-down. There never is with my kid. - I'm happy to do whatever she wants. - Well, getting the tree with you is all she's talked about since November, so. - Sounds perfect. Making her happy is my number one priority. - Well, let's go get the tree. - Hmm. - Here we are live, outside of Bliss Bakery, speaking with everyone's favorite hometown baker, Maxwell. Tell us, Maxwell, what delectable treats do you have today? Do I smell panettone, gingerbread, stollen? Tell us, what is this year's Red Falls favorite? - Yule log. - "Yule" better believe it. - And cut. - Thanks, Maxwell. - Well, I love yule log. Actually, so does my girlfriend. - Do you wanna bring an extra slice for your imaginary girlfriend? - Ah, ha, ha. - Stop looking. They'll call you when they've decided. - I've worked so hard for this, Ned. I feel like I'm the obvious choice, right? - Yeah. It's fine. You coming? - Yeah. - I've been saving up for your present, but you'll have to tell me 'cause well, adults don't write to Santa. - Being here with you and your dad is all I want. Let me help you find something really special for your mom. - Thank you for this. You made it happen. I know it's not as easy you're making out. - It's for all of us. We've always gotten along, and now that you have Suzy, it makes sense for us all to be together. - You think we'll ever really butt heads about anything? - Well, that depends on what you got Megan for Christmas, 'cause that drone last year was a close call. - But the pony in my luggage is okay, right? Thank you for being such an awesome mom and friend to me. And now to Suzy. - I'm just glad you found someone special. And magazine writer? Ah! Who better for the best-traveled photographer I know? - You mean the best there is, right? Seriously, we're here for a month, so if you have any plans, we will babysit anytime. - What you... oh, you mean like, for dating? No, no, no, I'm not dating. If I was, I would've told you. I'm happy with the way things are. It's boring, I know. - Dad? - Well, or as your parents say, set in your ways? - I'm gonna find us a happy family. - Still no call yet. - I, for one, actually hope they give it to someone else. You're my best reporter and you're my best friend. You're my only friend. I don't want you going anywhere. - Shucks. Appreciate that, but... ...this promotion's got my name on it, Ned. - Of course. You know what? I don't doubt that they'll see your potential. - Potential? Hey, wait, have the networks said something to you? - Big City News is a big step. Breaking Live isn't really what we're doing out here. - They're having doubts? - You're a great presenter, but you just haven't taken a small town story and proven you can take it national. - That's because there's never big enough stories in Red Falls. - But it doesn't have to be plane crashes and bank robberies, you know that. - Just have to... catch someone's attention. You know that dance that we did on the internet, in the newsroom? Hmm? This one? Are you watching? - Oh yeah. Yeah? - There he goes. - Yeah? Watching the feet? - Well, yeah. How about the hips? - Yeah. Yeah? You liking this one? Huh? Told you, you missed your calling, Ned. - Just find something universal. Something unique. How about a love story? Everyone wants love at Christmas. - Well... not everyone. - Cara, what do you think of this one? - Chet Walters, local reporter, reporting on local Red Falls festivities. What a classic Christmas moment this is. A beautiful, happy family. How are you all related? What's your name? - I'm sorry, what is this, breaking news, family buys Christmas tree? - What's your name, kiddo? - Megan. - So, what are your names? - This is my mom, Cara, my dad, Chris, and this is Dad's fiancée, Suzy, from Paris. They're getting married next spring. - Wow! Paris! And a soon-to-be stepfamily. - It's... blended family. - Blended. Like a good winter soup. Who's the pumpkin, who's the cream? So, uh, this is your first Christmas in Red Falls, soon-to-be Stepmom Suzy, whatcha got planned? - I've only just arrived but we are doing everything together as a family. - Uh, but will you be going to this year's Red Falls Festive Fandango with your fiancé? It's our Christmas Eve dance. Been going on 50 years now, and we'll be there live, covering it all evening. So, is there a Mr. Christmas taking you to the dance? - No. - You're a Christmas singleton? - Can you just like, cut to the weather? - We're not live. - I don't know what to tell ya. - Nothing wrong with being holly jolly jingle single. It can still be the most wonderful time of year, even if you are alone. - I'm not alone. I've got my blended family. Come, on, let's... - And cut. - Maybe we need to go to the dog shelter. - Cereal, muffins. What's this? - It's French toast. - I go to the patisserie for a croissant and baguette every morning. - Well, there is a bakery in Red Falls. There's fresh baked bread every day, and croissants. - Well... Megan's in her room writing a letter to Santa Claus. Think I'm gonna catch the rest of the game. - Okay, yeah. - Oh uh, these are for you and Chris. They're tickets to the Christmas dance. That annoying reporter was right, it is kind of a big deal in Red Falls. It's very traditional and very romantic. - Thank you. Being here is such a gift, too. I do know it can't be so easy. - I'm just happy that Chris has found someone special to bring. And that Megan gets to spend some time with you. - I don't think I would be so very generous. Please, let me know how I can help you. Anything you need. And maybe you will come to us for next Christmas. - Oh! Well... That is... that's very kind of you but um, you don't even know what country you're gonna be in, and Chris knows how homesick I get. - But now maybe you will travel some more? Grab hold of a little adventure? - Oh, Venetian glass! - Your dream trip is Venice, no? You said in one of our first video calls. I hope you will be inspired to go one day soon. But until your first trip, then these will look great with a little black dress. - Oh... uh, a little black dress. - You've bought me and Chris tickets to the Christmas dance, but maybe you could come too, with someone? - There is no someone. - Hmm... - Please, Santa, please, let my wish come true. Dear Santa, this is Megan in Red Falls. I only want one thing for Christmas. Please, Santa, find my mom a Christmas love. - Uh, four croissants, please, and some bread, and um, some blueberry muffins. - Coming right up! - What's this? - There are a lot of Megans in town, and I have no idea which one to return it to. - My soon-to-be stepdaughter is a Megan. Her mom is Cara. - I know them! Cara's a regular here. She normally buys up all the apple pie before anyone else can even get a look in. - Good morning! - Hmm. - Well, you're here early. Now, wasn't one of your goals to maintain a proper work-life balance? - I've accomplished all the goals I set the last two years. You know, selling the condo. - Mm-hmm. - Getting my new car. Running the 10K. - Even that one surprised me. - That's great, Ned. Thank you for your support. This last goal, getting that promotion, I know I can do it. - Or you could just let go of all the outcomes you can't control. - I need this promotion, Ned. So, I can move away and move on. - Well, how can I help? I gotcha. Ah, be right back. - One sugar, one cream. - What have you got for us, boss? Some TV magic? - It's my not-so-imaginary girlfriend. - Perhaps your mystery romance will be our big news story. - Funny. She sent me this. - Something cute? - It is a lost letter to Santa asking to find their mom love this Christmas. - Three hundred and fifty thousand hits and rising. People get so mushy at Christmas. - Hashtag Find Santa Mom is trending right now, too. - This will be national news by dinner time. - Probably. - Wait... - Hmm? - Isn't this Maxwell's bakery? - Yeah. - Yeah. Come on. - Yep. - So, it has to be an ugly jumper? - Mm-hmm. The uglier, the better. Especially when baking with Megan. She says that mine came from before fashion existed. She means the 90s. - You mean when Chris had that haircut? - And news now the photo gone viral from a little bakery in Red Falls. Four hundred thousand likes online and rising fast, for a lost Santa letter written by a little girl named Megan. And the whole country is wondering just who Santa Mom is? If you know, call it into us at the station. - Cara, there's a news crew here for you! Uh, Megan, let's come inside. - You? - Great to see you again. - Okay, what is this, breaking news, we made Christmas cookies. - Uh, there's plenty of Megans in town, but most too old to write to Santa. There's three who've written to ask for new phones. So, only your Megan left to call on. - That-that's Megan's handwriting. - Exactly. - And our paper. - Yeah, uh, Maxwell found it. - Yeah, don't worry, he sent it on to the North Pole already. - Maxwell, wait, no, I-I'm sorry, what is this? - Hashtag Santa Mom. - Hashtag what are you talking about? Who is Santa Mom? - You! And this is an exclusive for Channel 4 RF local news, soon to be national news. The whole country's just dying to meet Santa Mom. We're gonna go live in a minute. Shut the door again. No... - Get ready to answer like we just met. - Wait, what? - Just tell me your name, what your job is, a little bit about your life. - Um... I'm Cara, I uh... I teach at the kindergarten. Well, not during the holidays, obviously. Um, I have lived in Red Falls my whole life, which I love. - Cara... Cara, not yet, okay? We're gonna do that with the live. - Yeah. We'll take that as a yes. - What? - And uh, you got a little... Okay, you might wanna check. Anyways, okay. She's good, she's good. - Okay. - Ready. We're going live in... three... two... - Well, here we are, folks, outside of Santa Mom's house. Hashtag Find Santa Mom is about to be revealed in a Channel 4 RF TV exclusive. - Santa Mom! We tracked you down. So, tell us, what's your real name? - Is this really live? - Five hundred and fifty thousand people online have been obsessed with finding Santa Mom, and now, here you are. So, let's start with your name. - Holly! - Holly! How Christmassy! So, tell us, Holly, how long have you been looking for love? - Oh, um, I... I'm not. I'm... holly jolly jingle single, remember? - Stay tuned. We'll be back with Santa Mom real soon, everyone. - What just happened? - I wrote the letter and made the wish. - I uploaded it. - I told the news guys you were in. - I just want you to find someone special. - Well, that is very sweet of you, but Santa letters are supposed to be about what you want. - This is what I want. - Holly? - It's what you called me at the Christmas tree lot, okay? I didn't know if you wanted me to say my real name, or-or a Christmassy name. I mean, Santa Mom, Holly? I panicked. - You sure did. - What, no Hollywood smile? - Would you like one? - No. - You shut the door on me, which is only gonna make everyone at home more intrigued with you and... I would love an interview in your own time. - Look, I'm just a regular mom with way too much going on already. I'm not that interesting. - Yeah, but people still wanna get to know Santa Mom. - Have a nice day. - You're on a roll today. - Don't. - So, does this mean my wish won't come true? - What do you mean? - Well, everybody knows about it. - Well, it wasn't a birthday wish. You didn't close your eyes and blow out candles. - So, it will come true? - Megan's so disappointed I didn't do the interview. - An interview could be an adventure. - Oh I... I don't know what I'd say. I-I couldn't even remember my own name. - At least you know Megan's happy for you to date, now that she's told Santa. Maybe you could tell Chet that you're starting to think about thinking about dating. - No, I-I think that's enough excitement for one Christmas. - I think there was more than a little Santa magic involved in getting your letter to Maxwell's and you on TV. - It'll blow over. It probably already has. - Uh... What is going on? - Santa Mom, Red Falls. Saw you on TV, so, knew these were for you. All of them. Heh. - Okay. Um... But it's... someone asking for a date. Uh, New York? Texas? Red Falls. - There's hundreds! - Thousands! - Good luck with the wish, Santa Mom. - Look, you do need the exclusive. Just one interview with the Santa Mom. - I know. But how do I get her on side? - Cara was a pretty tough cookie in high school. But also, really fun. She still is. And she's kind, and sweet, and interesting, and somehow still single. - Mm-hmm, as you know her so well, what do you suggest I do, Maxwell? - Why don't you just tell her why you want the interview, rather than being... ...pushy. - Pushy? - Maybe just... ...don't tell Santa Mom that you need her to get a promotion. - Oh... Good one. - You're very welcome. Look who's here. - Usual, guys? - Thanks for sending my letter to Santa. - You're very welcome. - Mom was on TV and loads of people wrote her letters asking her on a date. - How many people? - The postman said thousands. - Sackfuls, from all over the country. - Can we get a picture? - Yeah, no, I guess? - Cool. - Cool. Yeah. - Well, that was a first. Feeling a little... overwhelmed by it all. - I would too. Megan tells me you got a lot of letters. - Yeah. - That's... impressive stuff. I guess now, there's a chance of the wish coming true. - Oh, no... uh, there would be, but I'm not interested in dating anybody. - Oh. Um... I'll get the usual for you guys. - Thank you. - Okay. I got, I got an idea. I'll be right back. Hey. May I have a word? - Is the word goodbye? - Your mom's funny, huh? Heh, heh. Um, everyone has been asking me who Santa Mom really is. No one even knows your real name's Cara. Or what you do, who you are. And now I hear you've had thousands of letters from suitors asking for a date. - Well... but I don't wanna date. - Why not? You see, I'm intrigued. Everyone is. Why not sit down with me and let everyone see who Santa Mom really is? One interview, not live. Everyone loves love at Christmas, and they wanna hear more about you, the letter, and if the Santa wish... ...might even possibly come true. - Um... - Hmm? - Uh... - That is a lot of letters. How many have you read? - Oh, not-not that many. But I'm not looking for a date. But I will write back and say thank you. - Huh. - Where is your cameraman? - Oh, Ned? He's technically my cameraman and boss. - Oh. - Uh, we thought one less person, seeing as you're not used to the limelight. You should probably change, too. Something more datey. Even though you're not dating. - Datey? - I think I'm gonna set up in the kitchen. - Uh... - Of the home. - No, Chris and Megan are in there. But set up by the Christmas tree. It'll be more sparkly and romantic. - Ooh, you want romance, then? - No. - Let's stick with the kitchen. - You know, you can turn off that TV smile. Might work on your audiences but it's not gonna work on me. Use the tree. Megan decorated it. - Okay. Use the tree. - Hello, Chet! Here's some people who wrote letters who would be a good date for Mom. - Hello, Megan. - Adam's my best choice. He owns the game shop in town and checks out lots of boxes Mom would like. - I interviewed him yesterday. Selling jigsaws like hot cakes. Local, likes sledding, interested in other people. - You're helping her find someone, so I thought I'd show you this. - Oh, I... I'm just here to... ...find out more about who your mom is for the viewers. I'm not helping her find a date. I'm not a dating agent. Or any good at dating, for that matter. - You don't have a girlfriend, then? - Huh. - You can look at my chart anytime! - Okay! Perfect. Yeah, um... - Okay. - You look great. - Thank you. - Uh, please have a seat and we'll uh... - All right. Now, all you have to do is just bring your whole self. - So, why the divorce? - That's what you're opening with? - Don't worry about the order of things. I can move it around in the edit. Just wanna get the difficult stuff outta the way. - Difficult? No. Um... me and Chris, we get along great. - We always have. That's why he's here with his new fiancée. - How do you get on, you and Suzy? - Fine. - Sounds diplomatic. - We're old friends. - So, why the divorce? - We got together when we were really young. We just... we grew up and we grew apart. I mean, we were just kids when we met. We had no idea who we were. And... as we got older, the differences grew bigger. I mean, I'm... not really into adventure. I more appreciate the little things. And... Chris is the opposite. - Hmm. So, you are ready to move on and date again. - Um... I'm sorry, have I said too much already? Am I oversharing? - Oh no, I... I'm not gonna use all of this. Just enough for the viewers to get to know you. Don't worry. - Okay, thank you. Could you be less pushy, too? - You're not the first person to call me that today. Okay, so um, let's just imagine if Santa was to make the wish come true, he'd have to find you what kind of date? - Someone patient. - Mm-hmm. - Interesting. Uh, interested in others. And he would have to be a hometown guy because I love it here. - What's the... real reason you're holding back? - To be honest... ugh... I wouldn't know where to start. It's been such a long time and it's such a big step into the unknown. I mean, what if I'm not good at it? - I think most people feel the same when they're dating. They have a lot of support and messages online. Hashtag Go Santa Mom. - Really? Mm-hmm? Am I? I... - What would be a fun date for you? You know, where would you go, what would you do... ...if you were dating? - Something local, romantic. Maybe a chance to dress up. It's been a while. - The Christmas Eve dance! I'll be there reporting live for Red Falls News. What if we set you up on a date to take you to the dance? I think I know just the guy. - Oh. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, what are you, a dating agent? - Red Falls News could help you get back into dating, and Christmas Eve, we could be live to the nation with Santa Mom's wish actually coming true. - You look great! - Are you excited, Mom? - Excited is a good word. Hey, could you help me clasp this earring, please? Thank you. Am I really doing this? - Megan says Adam's interesting, kind, and local. And he's nice looking, so I'm sure you're going to have a great time. - When did you become so aware? - I'm just trying to help make the wish come true. - Well, let's see how tonight goes, first. - It's going to go great. Look how many people are behind you. - You've got this, Mom! - Hashtag, go Santa Mom! - Hashtag what am I doing? - Local, hunky, a real Red Falls guy. Too shy to ask out the beautiful, fun, single mom until Santa fixed it. - Santa? - Oh, and the hashtag Go, Santa Mom is trending. - Still no promotion call. - Well, everyone loves a dating show, and everyone loves Christmas, so you've got the double here. - Yeah. - Hey! Uh... Adam's not coming? - I got you here a bit early to get you warmed up before your date. - Okay, great. Uh, so as I was walking over here, I was thinking that... well, of some interesting things that I can talk about, you know, about myself. I could talk about growing up here and my job. - Maybe expand on that a little. You know, why you were raised here and why you picked teaching for your job. - How so? - So, if I was interviewing myself, I'd say I was born and raised in Red Falls because my dad worked for the local newspaper, and he'd bring me along when I was a kid, which inspired me for this job. He's also my biggest fan. My mom was a homemaker who loved to cook. She was my biggest cheerleader, and critic, and taught me how to make the best apple pie. - Wow, you really do know how to talk. - Hmm, that's my job. - Where do your folks live in Red Falls? - Oh, they retired to Florida. - No way! Mine too! - So, why haven't you ever wanted to leave town? - I like it here. - Might want to build on that a little. You know, don't worry, I can give you some prompts if you get stuck. - I can do this. - I'm sure you can. - Yeah. - Adam! Hey! - Huh, Adam! - Hey! - Hey! Thank you so much for um... ...for everything that you've set up with... with Chet and-and you're here! And uh, you look great! - Actually, it was all Chet's idea and uh, yeah, it's perfect. - It's so perfect. And um... oh, love your hat. And your shoes. Wow. Um, and I can't wait to see what fun we have together. Well... uh... not together, together, but together. - Right! Uh, why don't you two go spend some time... ...together, and we'll meet you later for some tree choosing? - Gah! - Okay! - Great! - After you, fair maiden. - Oh, thank-thank you. - Hmm. You wanna try mine? - What is it? - Pumpkin... - Oh, no, I don't do pumpkin. - Okay, fine. Here they are. Looks like they're getting along great. - Well matched, apparently. - Well, Adam and I had a great walk! Didn't we, Adam? And there's a great tree over there. It's tall and it's spruce. Wait, do you like spruce, Adam? I like all Christmas trees, especially the tall ones. And the green -- - Adam, why don't you go grab a coffee with Ned? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Let's go. This way. - Bye. - Quick word, Car. - Yeah. - You're over talking a little. - I am? - Oh no, I must have been doing it on the whole date! Do you think I did it a little or a lot? - I -- - What if it was a lot? - You just... you're nervous right now, right? Because we're gonna be filming? - Yeah. - What about... - Ugh! - ...I give you a signal like this if you start overtalking again. - You think I'm gonna do it again? - No! Hmm. - Ugh! - Okay, you two, let's choose a tree and then you can tell me and the viewers all about how it went. - Oh, I'm gonna need some help with this. I was LARPing as an Orc last week and my shoulder's still out. - LARPing? - Live Action Role Playing. - Hold that. - Yeah. - This one? - Yeah! Thanks, Chet! - So, what do you think of Adam? - Well, it's my first date in a really long time. I'm not sure I know how to read the signals. And he keeps asking me what my favorite video game is, and I don't really know what to say. But it is nice to spend time with a guy on my own. - What do I do if Adam asks me to the dance? - Um, I'd say you should say yes. - You've only picked a tree once? - Mm-hmm. - For yourself or with someone? You know, I've never asked you, are you single or dating? - Don't start overtalking again. - I'm single. Not dating. - In three... two... - So, Cara, how's it gone tonight? - Well, um, I've had a really great time talking to Adam and choosing the tree, and doing old traditions with someone new, and I don't know, seeing if that's something that I can learn to -- - Can I ask you something, Cara? - Oh. - Yeah. - As you know, there's a big event coming up. It's the third annual Live Action Role Playing event being hosted by my store. - What? - And this tree would look really, really nice next to my castle. I would invite you, but you have to be a wizard. - Oh. - Do you mind if I take the tree? - Of course! - Thank you! - Uh... and... - Cut. - Let's forget about that disaster and order some food. - I don't even need a menu. I know the whole thing by heart. This is my favorite restaurant. - I actually used to come here a long time ago. - Really? My parents used to bring me here when I was a kid. Now I bring Megan. Italy's a place I'd really love to go to soon. - I thought adventure wasn't in your vocabulary? - Well, I am already on an adventure with you and this crazy Santa Mom thing so... - What would you say the most expensive dish is? It's on Chet. - It's the newsroom. Excuse me. - Hmm. - You're winding him up. - Yes, ma'am. Yeah, he went to Italy last year for one of his little life goals, and when he came back, all I got to hear about was the fabulous, expensive food that he ate over there. - Life goals? - Don't ask. Don't. You'll never hear the end of it. He's been doing them for about two years, and they're all completed, except for one. - What is it? - Your interview just went out. Everyone loves it. Station's getting swamped with messages. People are very excited about what's next for Santa Mom. - Uh, Adam? - Viewers love you. - Mm-hmm. - You're a natural on screen. - Ned said you went to Italy. One of your life goals. - Hmm. What else did Chatty Cathy say? - Nothing. - There's nothing more to say. Uh, now, let's talk about you. Hmm? Another date? But who? Maybe we shouldn't ask Megan's opinion again. Feel like she's a little underqualified. - Oh, but you are qualified? What-what's your dating history, huh? - Uh, why-why don't you go chalk and cheese? - Yeah. Huh? - My... opposites. My girlfriend and I are complete opposites and we're perfect together. - Ned's pretend girlfriend. - Oh! - That's funny. She's here for Christmas Eve. It's our first holiday together. - Is she the one? - Definitely. - Blind date. Who's not a match. From one of your letters you haven't read yet. And I'll pick. Since it's my idea, there won't be any pressure on you. - Yeah, it's your idea. - Like you said, Cara, Santa's got plenty on his plate already. Let me and Ned set this up. And we'll make that Santa wish come true. Hmm? - Snowmen, check. Snow angels, yes. Now, snowball fights! - I'm a better shot than Dad and Mom. I'll be on your team. - So... - Yeah? - That was Mom on the phone. Everyone saw the interview. They're going to watch the first date tonight, so I told them about Adam, but they're excited for my second date. - Ah, well, it looks like you are, too. - Actually, I think I am. - Awesome. - Chet's reminded me that all of this is just part of the adventure. - Oh, that's fantastic. Oh, I'll get that. You've been answering it all morning. - Thank you. - Can I watch your date with Adam on TV tonight? - Hmm, well, as long as you remember that sometimes a person you think you should match with, you don't. And then, the person you didn't think you'd match with is actually -- - Hello! - Hey! I love your snowmen. - That's Suzy, Dad, me, Mom, and her new boyfriend. - Does he have a name? - Not yet, but she's got another date. - Okay, Megan, show me how to make snowballs again! - So, another date! Someone local this time? - Chet is setting me up on a blind date this time. Sometime chalk and cheese, or opposites attract, or it's something like that. - So, they'd have to be the opposite of kind, and funny, and interesting. - Oh, we thought we'd try something different this time because my first date, he was supposed to be a good match... He was not. But Chet said he's going to make it look good using the magic of TV. - Oh, you're so brave. - Well... - I have no idea how I would feel going on TV, getting recognized? I like things to stay... ...just the way they are. - Hmm. - Although, I'm sure it would be very fun filming with you. Um... well, good luck today. - Oh! Yes! - Uh... bye. - Bye! Bye. - Ho, ho, ho! Ratings are off the chart. Network's over the moon, buddy. - And yet, still no promotion call. - But... date with Adam goes out tonight. That's a good watch. We have date number two, romantic skating. - With the perfect guy. Meet Nigel. His letter revealed he's only got two things in common with Cara. Wild card, for sure. - He could have nothing in common. The viewers are gonna love him. - Well, let's hope Santa Mom loves him too so they set a date for the dance, and you know... - Exactly. And the Big City News is definitely gonna be calling ya! Unh! - Dad said Nigel's the wild card. What does that mean? - It means that he could be a little bit different. He might be someone I wouldn't normally think about going on a date with. You know, we might not have much in common. - So, he might not like kids? - Oh no, liking kids is a must. But he obviously likes skating, like me, because that's where our date is. - But... why would you go on a date with someone you don't really match with? - Because sometimes opposites attract. - But you're amazing, Mom, so what will he be like if he's your opposite? - Just checking this out, letting you know. I feel like if we get them over there... you know? - You know what? He is definitely national newsworthy. That is one handsome man right there. - I'm sure he has plenty else to offer. - Hmm, hopefully. - He is good looking, though. - You bring your skates? - Oh yeah. But never mind them. I almost had to bring Megan and Suzy. My dating advisor wanted a sneak peek at Nigel. She wasn't quite sure why you picked him, but uh... think I'm starting to get it now. - Well, you can report back to Megan that not only is Nigel good looking, but he's also local. And he can charm a whole crowd. - Oh no, I am not giving Megan any more encouragement to help you. She's already a Chet Walters fan. - Good judge of character then. Look at this guy. There he is. All right. So, we will get you two skating, and then, we'll talk to you after the date. - You know what? I think we should forget skating. I want to get to know you a lot more. - Uh, why don't we ease off the romance straight away and get you skating, hey, Nigel? See what you got. - Is there snow room for compromise? - Let's get you skating, huh? - You know, I think you -- - You get on the ice and get on TV. Okay? - Hmm. Okay, fine. - Lace up! - Well... - Well, he's taking his time. And uh, he definitely likes the attention. - Sorry for the delay. - Thank you. Hey, take a load off. You're always working. - Yeah, I'm under a lot of pressure from the station. - Ned said you were getting a promotion. - It's not 100% decided. - Thank you for doing all of this. It's been really fun getting out there dating again and being Santa Mom. - Good! I mean, it's a team effort. Me, Ned, Megan, Suzy. - You did a great thing inviting her into your home and your life with Megan. Not many people would do that. - It's been... a little tough. I mean, me and Chris are long over and we're happy being friends but... ...it's still difficult. Seeing Suzy and Megan spend time together fills me with so much joy for them but... ...also makes me a little jealous. - Does that make me a bad person? - No, of course not. Uh... ...does Suzy know this? - Uh... no. No, I mean, I haven't been upfront about it, but... I'm sure she's figured it out. I've been a bit cold. - I'm sure she'll understand. - No, it's not fair. I... I really want everyone to be happy, including Suzy, so... ...I need to do better. Suzy's actually pretty easy company. - But what's her most annoying habit, you know, the thing that just drives you nuts? - She's a bit of a showoff about life in Paris. - Ooh, la, la! - Thank you for listening. I really appreciate it. - Yeah. - So, tell us, who is Chet Walters? You've spent a lot of time with Santa Mom, but me and the viewers still don't know much about you. - I don't have anything to say. I'm just a regular guy. - Okay, I'm gonna have to get pushy then. Seeing as this is a dating show, who has Chet Walters' eye? What is his dating story? Why is there no Mrs. Walters? - I'm sorry, you don't have to tell me that. - Abby was the weather girl. I know, I know, what a cliché. Well, we worked together and fell for each other hard. We were planning on getting married and starting a family. We got engaged and I worked extra hours to help pay for our first condo. I was totally smitten. But so was Brad, my boss. They left together Christmas Eve, two years ago. - Oh. I'm so sorry. - I picked myself up and focused only on me. I uh... I set goals I wanted to achieve. I ran a 10K, sold the condo, then I moved on to bigger stuff like travelling on my own through Europe and... ...getting promoted to Big City News. Gave myself two years. - Okay! So, medic took Nigel to go get an X-ray, but we still need somebody for the show. - How about Nigel and Cara early tomorrow at Maxwell's? - Nigel lied about being able to skate. I don't really like liars. I don't wanna date someone just for the show. - Of course. I'm not gonna ask you to do anything you don't want to. Forget Nigel, okay? We'll stay here, get you to do some skating, and then an interview about the date that never was. You are the star of the show. I am sure the viewers will be more than happy with just you. - Okay. - So, viewers, a twist with tonight's date. Santa Mom's date has twisted his ankle on the ice. We'll hear all about it, and more, from Santa Mom skating solo, in just a moment. - And cut. - Okay. - You know, it's a shame you didn't catch Nigel's fall on camera. - Yeah. I can't imagine he can ride a horse or ski either. Nigel had clearly never set foot on the ice before. - Well, I don't feel like skating alone, so go grab some skates and get out here. - Uh, no, you do not wanna see me out there. - Ah, I think I can handle your showoff moves. - Uh no, it's not that. - Let me guess, you start with a three-turn, and then, you move into a flying sit spin. - No, Cara, I -- - Oh, okay. No, it must be a camel position moving into a layback spin. What can't Channel 4's Chet Walters do? - Skate. - You can't skate? - There's a lot of things I can't do. - Go put some skates on. - All right. - You got this. - I got this. - Gimme your hands. - Come on, take my hand. - Ah! - You're okay. You're okay. Good, good! - Okay. All right we gotta... - Okay. - ...now we gotta go. - Here we go! - This way? - This isn't too bad. - Whee! - Hey, you better not be filming this! - Oh, I'm definitely not. Go, go! - We need to set you up on another date. You pick this time. I'll stay out of it. We have to get your love life back on track. Third time lucky! - I'm willing to try. - Hey, you two done? My girlfriend has a window open for a video date before we plan this unfortunate shoot. - Tell your imaginary girlfriend she'll see your goofy mug very shortly. - Hey! She loves this goofy mug. - Come on, hold my hand. You're okay, you're okay. Good, good! - Okay. - Skating with a pretty cool single mom wasn't on your list of life goals. - Can I help you, boss? - The date with Adam is going out. You're missing it. We're all watching. - Any feedback from the viewers? - Well, everyone loved Cara. And they all wanna see the wish come true for her. - You got any suggestions for date number three? - Think you have a much better idea than me on who she'd match with. - Okay. Now that Megan's gone to bed, let's think about this properly. - What about this guy? He says he likes chess and cooking. - Is he local? - Alaska. - Am I being too picky? I mean, the yes pile has no yeses in it. - No, your no's are no's. There'll be a yes, more than one, and a lot more letters. - Thank you for helping with... ...all of this. If you hadn't have uploaded Megan's letter, then... I would not be on this crazy adventure. - It wasn't quite what I intended... ...but I'm glad it's led to something exciting for you. - Well, we have to let Chet know who I picked so... - Chet seems like a good guy. - Yeah, he's fun. And he's really helping me with my confidence. You know, there is a lot more to him than what you see on TV. Behind that big TV smile, there is a really genuine guy who's been through a lot. - So, what about -- ...Chet? - Huh? - Someone's left this. I'd love to take you out for dinner. M. - Maxwell, um, thank you for the gift. They're my favorite cookies. Um, I can't stay right now but... ...I would love to go on a date with you. - Great! Okay. Uh, I'll... see you later. - Hey! - So, it looks like date number three's been right here all along. Kind, interesting, loves the outdoors, likes kids, bakes a mean apple pie. - Yeah, exactly! I mean, I've known him since high school, and he's just been right in front of me this whole time. I think I got so used to him being a friend that I've just never seen him in this light. But now, it's so obvious that... Could we make the date something really romantic? - Absolutely! Yeah, Channel 4 will set all that up with Maxwell. - Sounds great. - Viewers are gonna love it. - I think I am, too. Okay, bye. - Confirmed a special sponsor for the live show of the Christmas dance 'cause I'm awesome. - Oh. Yep. - And everyone is rooting to see that first dance with Santa Mom and her date, whoever that is. Santa Mom! Maxwell is just a little late, but he's on his way. Don't worry. - Two practice dates. This one's the real one. The one that's gonna land. - Can I actually get the both of you to sit in for lighting? Just until Maxwell arrives? - No problem. - Sure. Still can't believe it's been in front of me this whole time. It seems so obvious now that Maxwell could be a match. - Yeah, you said. But perhaps as you weren't dating before, you didn't notice it... him. - Well, now everyone is going to see it. You, Ned, the camera. - Forget the camera. - That's easy for you to say, it's your whole world. - I'm not always Chet Walters with a big smile. - Oh no? - Mm-mm. - Well, who is off-camera Chet Walters? - You interviewing me again? - It's not a hard question. What do you do outside of this? - There's not much to tell. I'm just a reg-- Regular guy. Yeah. - I'm a regular guy who lives a simple life. I like visiting my family, going for hikes... - Your family aren't local. - Yep, they were the first Walters to ever leave Red Falls. - I bet they miss it. Mine do. The scenery, the little shops, the community. - It's a good town. - I knew it! You do like it here. - So, what is next for Chet Walters? You're all out of life goals. - What would you suggest? - You could try dating. - I wouldn't know where to start. - I could return the favor. - Anyone in mind? - What's your type? - Kind... ...interesting... ...always puts others first. Loves the outdoors. Is beautiful. - All right, Maxwell's here. - Yep, mm-hmm. - Ready? - Yep! - Yes. Great. - Of course. - All right. - Thank you. - Thank you. All right, let's go this way. - Ooh! - Sorry. - Oh. - Okay, we're here. Let me get this. - Oh! Oh! - Got it. We're fine. - Yeah. Oh. Hmm. It's okay. Don't worry about it. I know what I like. - Cut! - Yeah. Yeowwwww. - Quick word, Maxwell? - Yeah. - Yeah, be right back. - Yeah. - Relax. - Yeah. - Imagine none of us are here. - Are you kidding? It's hard enough putting myself out there with Cara. Nonetheless with all of you here, too. - Don't worry. - That's a lot of pressure, for sure. How can I take some away? - I don't... know. How did Cara get used to it? - Practice. Which you don't have. - Great. Thank you. What would you do if you were nervous on a date? - Um... ...it's been a while, but uh... I'd probably sit side by side, take the pressure off of being eye-to-eye. Find a little space. - By getting closer? - Mm-hmm. - All right. Good idea. Let's go for it. - Right. Ned! - Yeah? - We'll move them, side by side. - Closer? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. ♪ Watching you during this holiday ♪ ♪ With your pretty smile ♪ And your kind and tender ways ♪ ♪ I see the goodness ♪ When I look into your eyes ♪ And I wonder if you even realize ♪ ♪ That if I could make just one wish ♪ ♪ I'd spend Christmas with you ♪♪ - No, that's good. - Yeah, thanks. It's going good. - Yeah. - It's been kinda weird having a first date with so many people around. But I think it's gone okay. Maxwell's nice. - No overtalking, no awkward laughs. It's going great. - Yeah. - Good, yeah. Yeah. - We still have a bit to set up so why don't you sit here, take some time out. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay, here are the tickets to the Christmas Eve dance. All arranged. But Cara doesn't know you're gonna ask her now. - I'm not so sure. - Why not? - Is it too soon? - So, another date to find out then? - I should really... think about it, right? - She's really into you. - How do you know? - I've been on her other dates. I've really gotten to know her. - Okay. All right. - Great! Why don't you go take five and we'll set it up. - All right. - Well, I'm gonna call the network, tell them that we're definitely on for the big Christmas finale. Well done, man. That is a cute hometown Red Falls couple. - Yes! Yes, thank you. Uh, I will. I appreciate the offer. All right, bye. - Good news? - Uh... um... yeah. That promotion... it's mine. - Congratulations! - Thank you. - Oh, so does this mean that you're taking Ned's job? - This is more of a... a lateral move for the news team. - But you are the news team. - It's a job in the city. I'll be leaving Red Falls. - In the city. Wow! - Yeah. - Well, what about... every man Chet Walters who loves his country hikes and apple pie? - I'll figure it out. - Uh... when do you leave? - Christmas Eve, after the dance. - Oh! - You need a hand? - Thanks. I'm hopeless without a mirror. - Venetian glass. - I've always wanted to go to Venice. - Stunning. Impossible to forget. - Can I ask you something? - Mm-hmm. - Um... Did Maxwell plan this or... did you? - Does it matter? - You know I like honesty. - I know this is your favorite restaurant 'cause your parents used to bring you here when you were a kid. And now Megan loves it too. And I know that you... ...like a quiet dinner for two, nothing fancy. And I know you're nervous right now 'cause your tell's not just overtalking but brushing your hair behind your ears. And I know you wore your red Venetian glass earrings tonight because it's a date you care about. You don't wear them any other time. And they are beautiful on you, by the way. - Okay, we're ready. - Uh, Chet got his promotion. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. Great news, right? - Yep. - Yeah. All right. - Action. - Thank you for the lovely evening. - And you. It was great. - Perhaps you'd like to do it again? I've got uh, two tickets to the Christmas dance. - Well, um... Uh, yes, of course. - Oh no. Another bad date? - Worse. Two dates. - I'll leave you to it. - Two dates? - There were like two moments with the two me's, Cara and Santa Mom. There was Maxwell, and we had fun, it was great, and there was a kiss on the cheek on camera. But before that, there was dinner, without dinner, and without an audience, with Chet. You're not surprised. - Are you really? - I don't know. I-I-I don't know what I feel. I don't even know what's real anymore. But Chet is leaving town. I mean, he got this new job, and it's not in Red Falls, so... ...he's leaving on Christmas Eve. - What's your heart saying? What would Cara do? Not Santa Mom. - Chet. - Hey, congratulations, buddy. - Thank you. - All the best, eh? - Cara. - Wants a word. - Sure! We're still planning the dance details. Two days to go so, plenty of time yet. What's up? - I don't wanna be Santa Mom anymore. I just wanna be Cara. - What? - I don't really know how I'm feeling about what's happening on camera and off camera, and I just wanna stop filming. - Why don't we take a seat and talk about it? - I don't have time to talk right now. I'm taking Megan to the snow park. - Right, okay. - Can we talk later? - Sure. - Okay. - We're all set to go national. Live feed across the network. It's a big moment, buddy. But if Santa Mom isn't gonna show, you have to call Big City News and unpack your things. The wish does have to come true. - Aren't you supposed to be at work? - I am! I have some very important interviews to do right here. Time for a snow and tell. Tell me, young lady, what are you driving today? And you, ma'am? What did you bring to this very important race? - Oh, this is a race now. - We are going to have snow much fun and boldly go where snowman has gone before. Now tell me, do we start at the bottom or the top of the hill? - Have you never tobogganed before? - What do you think? Last one to the top's a rotten candy cane. Come on to the top! - Hurry, Megan! - Mom said you got a new job in the city. - Yeah! Big news stories with car chases, bank robberies, and bad guys. - Why don't you just stay here? - You know, your real smile, it's much better than your TV smile. - The real Chet Walters, that's who you should be all the time. - Oh, I'm sorry I didn't say anything more back at the office. - I don't think Maxwell's the guy for me. - Okay. - So, I don't know where that leaves us. - With the filming? Because I actually wanted to talk to you about that. You see, my job, my promotion actually turns out not to be so certain. - Oh, so you might not leave? - Well, no, it's just that -- - Watch out! Snowball assassin! Watch out! - Huh! - Ah! I think I won. - I think we need a rematch. - Think I'd rather go on the hill again. - Well, we have to meet Chris and Suzy soon, so how about one more toboggan run? - Yay! - I should probably... get back to work too. Uh, but before I go, sorry to bring it back up again but well, the promotion. - Yeah, so the move might not happen. - It depends. - I get that you wanna move on after Abby. I... I really do. I felt the same way after my divorce. It's like the town felt different and I just, I wanted to get out and have a fresh start. But things can change. They can get better. Even better than before. - Absolutely but the thing is -- - I'm ready to go now! I'll walk with Chet. - You are so fast on that thing. I gotta get some tips. - Can I tell you something? - What's on your mind? Current status of Wall Street? - I wanna put you on my chart, at the top! Every box will be checked, same as Maxwell. - Hmm... wrong. Not a homebody. I'm leaving town for a new job. - Mom said sometimes the person you fall in love with isn't the person you're supposed to fall for. - I think your mom's better suited for Maxwell. I mean, they kissed. - She said he kissed her on the cheek. - That was fun. - Thank you, Cara. And thank Megan for me as well, if she can tear herself away from the gingerbread. - Maybe we could do this again... soon? - Yeah! Uh... tonight. - After 8:00? I could ask Chris and Suzy to take care of Megan. - Perfect. - Okay. Okay! - Okay. I'll see you uh... tonight. - Yeah. Bye. - Hey, any messages come in for me? - No, nothing yet. - All right. Well, uh, keep me posted. - Okay, will do. - Hey! He's been waiting for ya. Wants to know if there's gonna be mistletoe or something for Cara and Maxwell to kiss under. - Cara's not back on board yet. But I'm going to her house later. - Okay. - Okay. - Look, you wanted to leave town just to leave the past behind, so what if there's something better than a promotion to stay for? - I can't turn down this promotion, Ned. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I have worked very long for it. - Okay, I get it. I know I'd hate to lose you. Maybe other people would too. Well, you can come and update the big boss. - You'll have to be honest with Maxwell soon. Especially if Chet's coming around tonight. - I'll tell Maxwell first thing that the dance is cancelled and the filming. I... I just didn't feel a spark. You know, I think I just got so carried away with making everyone else happy and being Santa Mom. - I'll leave you to it. - Maxwell, I am so sorry. I should have been honest earlier. - Yeah, me too. I was under all this pressure when I asked you to the dance, with the filming. Didn't wanna let you down. I was gonna come talk to you. - I think we both just got carried away by it all. - That I think we did. But I had a great time with you on our date. You're really fun. I just didn't feel a spark. - Yeah. But the dance, you can have the tickets back. Take someone else. - Yeah... those are Chet's tickets. - He arranged it? - He's the one that suggested I ask you, in the restaurant. - He can be pushy. - That he can. But I'd still love to take you to the dance, just as a friend. If you want. If you're not going to ask someone else? - Oh... I don't have anyone else. - Don't you, though? - We're not going live on Red Falls News, are we? - Uh, no. Um... - Well, come in! - Uh, actually... About you and Maxwell, I... - Oh, um actually, I saw him earlier and we both agreed that we just got carried away with the filming, and so, we're not going to the dance. - But I really need you to go to the dance. - What? - The network execs, they all want you to finish the Santa Mom story, for all our viewers. - But I told you that I didn't wanna be Santa Mom. I... I just wanna be me. Not someone fake. - You're great on TV. You-you are not fake. - But my date with Maxwell would be. I mean, you told him to invite me to the dance. - I encouraged him. - He didn't feel a spark, and neith er did I. I don't have feelings for him. He's not the guy for me. It's... I'm sorry, um... You know what? I get it now. You never cared about helping me. Finding me dates, finding me love, no, you just wanted that job and to leave. Well, please, let me help you. I'm gonna tell Maxwell that we are going to the dance, for you, for your show, for your promotion, and then, when we're done, we won't have to see each other ever again. - Hey! - Hmm. - So? How'd it go last night? - Cara's agreed to go to the dance with Maxwell. - All right, well the promotion's on. Is that what you really want? - Yeah. Cara doesn't... ...actually wanna do the filming with Maxwell, though. I feel like I messed up with her. - Well, love is messy and it's complicated. It's not training and running a 10K and selling your condo. - You messed up but you can fix it. - I think she's better off without my involvement. So, I'm just gonna finish the story tonight and then I'm leaving Red Falls. - Well, congratulations, buddy. Who would've thought that the big story to get your broken heart outta town would be a love story? And it's yours. - I should never have put myself out there. - You've had an adventure. - No, I should've just stayed stuck in my ways and not changed a thing. - Megan and a little Christmas magic changed everything. - It was a sweet wish. - You deserve to find love. You put everyone else first. That's why Megan wrote the letter and why it went viral, because everyone loves love. - Chet doesn't. - Maybe he's just scared. He wasn't looking for you and you could change everything for him. - He's just so stuck on what he wants. His list of life goals. He-he won't see what's right in front of him. - Maybe he can't believe it's real, his feelings for you. And even more, yours for him. - Hmm. Feel like he just tricked me with his TV smile. - What are you going to do? - Go to the dance with Maxwell. He's a good guy. Red Falls and everyone will be happy, and they'll think it's real and that the wish came true. - Maxwell? I have an idea. - What's all this? - We're all coming! - The whole blended family. - Well, who's the pumpkin and who's the cream? - We are going to have a great time, all of us. - Well, let's go. - Oh, this old thing? - Thank you. - Hey, buddy. - Huh. You look like all your Christmas wishes came true at once. - Not quite all of them. Wow, Cara looks amazing. We have had so many people messaging in already. Network's to the moon. - That's great, Ned. Is that your mystery gal? - Yeah. Well, I have something very important that I need to do. If you'll excuse me. - So, uh, I guess this is your last report for Red Falls then. - Cara, I want -- - Honey, will you marry me? - Wow. Ned has got guts. In front of everyone. I hope she says yes. - Of course, she will. - All right! - Ah, Maxwell's here. - Hey. - And here we are, at the end of a wonderful week full of romance and Christmas magic, live at the Red Falls Christmas Eve Dance, with our favorite couple. And the answer to the question on everyone's minds... ...yes, Santa wishes do come true. Let's speak with our leading man, Maxwell. - Good evening, Chet. - Tell us, Maxwell, what makes Santa Mom so special? - Why don't you tell us, Chet? - Sure! Cara is a fantastic mom, and a real fan of Red Falls. - And? - And... she's a great teacher. Terrific on a toboggan. Kind, interesting, she always puts others first. Uh, your turn, Maxwell, she's your date. Ha, ha, and then we'll ask Cara all about you. - Um, actually, I have a confession to make. - Okay... shoot. - I gave my ticket to someone that has a lot of love for Cara. - And who would that be, then? - Me. - Uh, that's sweet, but I don't think that's quite what the Santa wish was, heh, heh. - I'm giving the ticket to someone who Mom would love to take and who would love to take her. - That is a whole lot of who's. Uh, who is this who? - You! - We don't have an ad break to cut to, do we? Then uh... I'm gonna have to uh, do what I do best. Talk. Uh... As you know, I'm Chet Walters, local reporter for Channel 4 Red Falls News. But what you didn't know is that I've just been promoted to Big City News. A goal I've been chasing for two years now. Everything and everyone else aside. A goal that was not on my list was finding love. Yet somehow, love has found me. And grabbed a hold of me. And instead of accepting this incredible gift, I've imagined everything that could go wrong. Would go wrong if I opened my heart again. I love it here in Red Falls. And uh... ...I'm in love with you. And I've just been focused on me and my goals. I... I'm so sorry. I'm moving away to move on, because that's what I thought I should do because... I didn't believe what was real and right in front of me. I didn't believe that I was the one for you and that... Uh... I knew when I started falling in love with you that everything would change. All my plans and goals. But I just kept trying to hold on to everything I promised myself. I guess I... didn't wanna get hurt again. You know, I tried desperately to keep focused, to... protect myself. - How's that working out for you? - Yeah, it's going... it's going great. - Yeah. - And all on live TV, so. - Yep. Well, it's a shame you're leaving because I think we might be the perfect match. - The chalk and cheese. - The wild cards and the set in our ways. - Will you dance with me?
