"So, we can all learn from William Henry Harrison "to wear our coats and wash our hands, so we have better immune systems. "The end." Good job, Annie. Okay, Annie B., your turn. You sure there's time? l don't wanna keep anyone from vacation. Just get up here. - Where's your essay? - Up here. And it's more of a performance piece. Here we go. My president is Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was elected in 1932, when almost everyone was poor. So, pretty much just like now, but without the lnternet. Everyone except the front row, you be the poor people. You're hungry and mad. So, growl and stomp your feet. Front row, good news, you're the rich people. Laugh and clap like you're better than everybody. But FDR didn't like it that everyone was poor, so, he gave them all jobs. He called it the New Deal. Work hard, and you get rich. So, when l tap you, you're rich. He had people build roads and got paid. Cut down trees and got paid. Made it easy to buy a house, go to college. Soon, the whole country was happy. But don't worry, rich people. You're still better than everyone because you get even richer! Good job, Annie. Have a good vacation, everyone! - You gonna make it in time? - l always do. - We'll cover for you. Good luck. - Luck's for suckers.

We all have families somewhere. - Can you read your note again? - Okay. Oh, God. For the millionth time? Yeah, read it, Annie. But quietly. They went to Domani's, ordered two cannolis, and wrote me this note. "Please take care of our baby. Her name's Annie. "We'll be back to get her soon. "There's half a locket around her neck, and we have the other half, "so when we come for her, you'll know that she's our girl." Can l see it? They're gonna come back for all of us. l promise.

Aren't l supposed to be married to George Clooney? Get out of bed and start cleaning! Who's George Clooney? Exactly, girlfriend. Exactly. No breakfast until this place is spotless! l hate her so much. And if you find any loose change over a nickel, it's mine. l was having the best dream. l was ice-skating on real, live ice. Save your dreams for good stuff. Like shopping with an unlimited credit card. Or swimming in candy. Or flying to the moon in a rocket ship. All things that will never happen. Now, clean like your life depends on it. 'Cause it does! lt's the hard-knock life. Wait. What does "hard-knock life" mean? lt means our life sucks. Then, yeah.

Put this together. lt's a kitty cat. - What should l do? - Pray. l've tried. lt hasn't worked yet. Okay. Showtime! You guys, act well cared-for. We love you, Miss Hannigan! Take it down a thousand. Nobody's gonna believe that. Get under here. Well, hello there. Are you Colleen Hannigan? My maiden name. But l'm not married to it, if you know what l mean. - No. - Come on in. The girls are just recreating. - Should we start here in the bathroom? - Why, Mr. lnspector, how forward you are. But l'm right behind you. - What? - What? - No, l'm asking you. - This way. Wait, what? Your arms are so strong! The dude dropped this. This has all of our information. - Really? - You're kidding. - Damn. l've been in a lot of homes. - This says l've been in millions. That's your Social Security number, dummy. What's a scoso curcurity murder? lt's what the government uses to keep track of us. Wait. This is what l need to get my records. And find my parents. l'll copy it down. Plan your exit. Okay. You know, people come for the bathroom, but they stay for the bedroom. - What? - You know it. Can l go to the library to study? Can we talk about this after the handsome inspector with no wedding ring is gone? Okay. Can l have some floss? l think l have some nutritious breakfast stuck in my teeth. What? Pretty sure l saw some in the medicine cabinet. Right there? You know, l just remembered. We're out of floss. Maybe you wanna pick some up on your way to the library. Thank you, Miss Hannigan. - Bye, Mr. lnspector. - Bye, now. Seems like a great kid. Yeah, she seems great. l know that run. How much you need, mija? $43.55. - By when? - Now? Go rob Bank of America. Here, l'll loan you my mask. l'll work for it. Please, Lou. That face. Take the expired drinks from the cooler. Go ahead. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Whoa, what are you doing, girl? This ain't no Whole Foods. Don't throw them out. Change the date. I believe in hard work. I don't just settle for "okay." "Great" is all I know. I built my company to be a worldwide leader. And that's what I wanna do with the city. I wanna make it great again. You're 20 points down in the polls. You've got billions to spend and it's not working. How are you gonna change people's minds? Everybody wants to count my money. 4.3 billion. You know, l have feelings. And l feel for people that are out there... - Baba Booey! Baba Booey! - Yes. See. That's probably one of my satisfied customers right there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is terrible. Do you really think a businessman can run the city? At Stacks Mobile, l made a cell network that never drops a call. As mayor, l'm gonna make a government that never drops a citizen. Yeah, as long as those citizens live below 96th Street. You're lucky you can't vote yet, mija. Politicians are all liars. What dates should l change these to? One week for the milk. Two weeks for the juice. You need to smile more. You only smiled four times. ls that right? Really? Voters respond 23% more favorably to full-teeth smiles. Yeah. How about thumbs up, huh? Sixteen percent better if you give them a single. Thirty-eight percent if you shoot them the double. Why do l get the feeling like l'm wasting my time here? Am l gonna win, or not? - 'Cause this seems like a waste of time. - You hired me to win. You're gonna win. - Put this on. - Why? l'm already dressed. - How you doing? - Here. Whoa, l gotta feed the hobos? Don't say "hobos." Say "bums." For some crazy reason, everybody thinks you're a rich elitist that can't relate to regular people. So, the girl from Oxford is trying to tell me how to keep it real. l'm telling you if you want a chance at this, you're gonna have to remember where you came from. Okay, Gatsby? Compliment them on the food, but not too much. - l ain't eating this food. - You're gonna eat the food. And you're gonna like it, but you're not gonna love it, okay? We don't want to seem like we're pandering. - l don't eat hobo food. - All right. That's good. How we doing, folks? Starving? How do you sleep at night? Silk sheets and Ambien. Look at all these handsome faces! There you go. All right. And here we go. God bless. Bet you never had mashed potatoes, Mr. Stacks. Are you kidding me? Why, my grandmother made some of the best mashed potatoes in Queens. You know, that's where l'm from. Born and raised. On the playground's where l spent most of my days. And look at this. lt's not amazing, but it ain't terrible. Look at this. Went down the wrong pipe. This is disgusting. Look, it's terrible. Oh, God. You're a child. Well, how do you guys think that went? Nash, you saw it. Would you vote for me if you didn't work for me? No, sir. Thank you for your honesty. You're fired. That didn't take long. And there are already parodies. Mashed potatoes Mashed potatoes Mashed potatoes, mashed potatoes In Queens - See, this is why China's winning. - Not really. Maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Just because you can run for mayor, doesn't mean that you should. We already discussed this is great for my profile. lt's going to grow the company. Plus, the city needs me. All right. Take it easy, Batman. You let all your employees talk to you like this? The ones that make me billions, l do. You make me mayor, you can say anything you want. Hey! Oh, no. Not again. Nash. Why we stopping? Sorry, Mr. Stacks. l'll fix it. Next! l'd like to get my records please. You'll need DOH form number 4380... .7-8. - And $43 and... - 55 cents. And an application signed by a parent or a... Guardian. Bam. lt's all there. Are you going to stare at me the whole time? Sorry. - Next! - Can you read it? l'm too nervous. "Annie Bennett. Abandoned outside 26th Precinct. "Age estimate at time of abandonment, four years. "Placed in state foster care. No further data." What does "no further data" mean? That's all there is to know about you. Sorry, honey. lt's okay. l'll figure it out. The sun'll come out tomorrow Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow There'll be sun Just thinkin' about tomorrow Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow 'Til there's none When I'm stuck with a day That's gray, and lonely I just stick out my chin and grin And say, oh Faster, Daddy!

Don't need them. - This is all your fault. - Take it easy, pantsuit. And, you... l'm sorry. Hey, Stacks! Your phone bill's killing me, bro! - Get it! - l told you to stop! Try to hit it! Leave it alone! Hey! - All right, kick it! Kick it! - Stop! - Leave it alone! - See how scared it is! Leave it... - Watch where you're going, kid! - Are you okay? - Let's get out of here! - You could've got run over. - Sorry. - Don't be sorry. You be careful. - Why're you running? - Gets me to places quicker. Little kids. Kids with germs. How was the library? Educational. Well, l have some more education for you. l told the inspector l don't wanna foster you anymore. As of next week, you're somebody else's problem. Did they say who? Not a who, sweetie. A what. Group home. Okay. Maybe that'll teach you to stop running your mouth. So, where are we with our new phones? - Well, we've got the battery up to 150 hours. - That's not a week. l said l need the charge to last a week, Grace. Specifically. At the moment, unfortunately, the phone is burning up in people's hands. What? That's what I told Mom. And she says to me, she... You burned me! Don't worry. She signed a waiver. You burned me! What up, Guy-O? You're up. Five points in the polls. Really? They liked that he vomited on a homeless man? No, Grace. They liked the fact that he saved a little girl from getting hit by a van. Some guy recorded it, put it on the Internet. Check it out. "I'm a little girl who doesn't see where I'm going. "Well, look! I bumped into the future mayor of New York who just saved my life!" This is fantastic, Will. I'm telling you. It's the most human thing you've done - this entire campaign, all due respect. - None taken. You didn't tell me you saved a little girl. You didn't tell me anything. Like Batman. Hey, listen to me. You gotta capitalize on this. - Of course we do. - You invite her to lunch. - No. - See how she's doing. Snap a few pics. The press'll eat this up. - Do we know who she is? - That's the best part. She's a foster kid from Harlem. Did you hear what I said? Foster kid! Harlem! Your undereye vein is bulging. - I'm gonna go get her. - No. l'm gonna let Grace go get her. - What? Why? - What? That's a terrible idea! Do you actually want 5-hour ENERGY to go over there and scare this little child? - l don't even know what this is about. - Grace, please. For me, Grace. Please. - Thank you. - Will, let me go to Harlem. - Please. Don't send her. - They will whoop your ass in Harlem. - Don't shut me off. - Thank you. Don't shut me off! Yeah. ls that Colleen Hannigan? l was wanting to talk to you about a girl in your care. Annie. l work for William Stacks and he would love to take Annie out for lunch. Why? They ran into each other yesterday. She didn't tell you? No. We didn't have a chance to have our girl-talk jawbone last night. Annie! So you said he ran into her? 'Cause l noticed that her neck did seem a little whiplash-y. We are happy to make a donation to the charity of your choice. Gosh! There's so many to choose from. - There is. - Let's see, Save the Whales, of course. And Clean Water, but you can't have whales without water. Gosh. You know what? Just make it out to "cash." l'll divvy it up. - Perfect. - Annie! You know, she's such an angel. We don't inherit the Earth, we borrow it from our children. lt's a lovely sentiment. There she is. Hi, Annie. l'm Grace. l work for Mr. Stacks, the gentleman that you ran into yesterday. He'd like to invite you to lunch. l promise we won't keep you long. You can keep me as long as you want. - No way! - ls this for real? - This car's as big as a subway! - You're so lucky! lt's incredible. - Oh, my gosh. l want that! - Oh, my gosh! Help yourself to whatever you want. No way. Really? Sure. - Give me this! Give me this! l want this! - Oh, my God! - l want that one! l want that! - This is crazy! My God! Kids love candy, huh? Hey, Annie! Maybe l should come with you and make sure that everything's USDA Grade A awesome, huh? l'm good. Thanks. Bye, Annie! - Bye! - Later. - Thanks! - Oh, my gosh. Hey, gorgeous! How does it feel to have a famous kid? What are you talking about? lt's Annie! Your Annie! Hey, you wanna go out tonight? l got my dance pants on. l haven't hit that rock bottom yet. l love it when you throw me shade! - Here, Lou. - lt's okay. She likes me. Oh, my God, this is so good. Mr. Stacks would like to take some pictures with you, if that's all right. - l guess so. Why? - People wanna know that you're okay. - What people? - Everybody who saw that. My hair's gigantic. - We can listen to whatever you like. - Can you put on talk radio? Are you sure you don't wanna listen to music? l love talk radio. lt calms me. So do l. l loved it when l was a little girl. l used to think that they were all my friends. Sorry, that sounded very sad. Sorry. l have a lot of friends, so don't worry about me. l mean, so l work a lot. l do. And l could have some more friends. But how many friends do you really need? l mean, if you were my parents asking me, "Are you fulfilled and are you happy, Grace?" That's a whole different conversation, right? But we're not having that conversation. And, frankly, it's really not your position to ask me that at all. So... Okay. There she is. Our own Little Orphan Annie. Foster kid. She's here. Hey, this is the one, right? All right. Let's get this. Slow your roll. - Excuse me? - Can we eat first? lt was a long drive. Yeah, yeah. Go, go. Yeah, yeah, sure. Let's eat. We got time for that. All right. So, how are you feeling from yesterday? So, what's the hustle? What makes you think there's a hustle? There's no hustle. Come on, come on. l'm 10. l'm not an idiot. l never said you were... an idiot. Or 10. Truth of the matter is, l don't know how old you are. - Ten. - Well, now we know that you're not an idiot. But there are a lot of people out there that are and when they saw that photo of us, they thought that l would make a great mayor. Why? Why? Because l'm a... l'm a rich guy. l saved an orphan. l'm not an orphan, l'm a foster kid. And you didn't save me. l didn't save you? l didn't just push you out of the way of a van? Why don't l call that van back and have him finish up what he... You know what? The more we're seen together, the better it is for my campaign. - Wait. That's how a mayor gets elected? - Yes. lnsane, isn't it? l bet if l moved in with you, you'd become president. Move in with me? This is not that kind of party. That's it. That's it. That's it. l think he wants to tell you something. Actually, that's not a bad idea. Annie coming to live with you. - What? - What? From what l understand, it's very crowded where you live. How'd you like some more space? ls that something that you might like? Living with the richest guy in the world? Yeah, that's something l might like. - Great. Perfect. - Guy. What are you talking about? Listen to me. lt'll only be for a few weeks. Then she'll go back to wherever she came from. Taking in a foster kid, that's an automatic 15 point jump in the polls. - Guaranteed. - You want me to play Daddy? lt's easy. All l need is a bed and meals. You don't have to do anything else. And you get $157 a week. Do l look like l need $157 a week? Everybody needs an extra $157 a week. You're not really thinking about doing this? You want photos, right? - l'm sure there's easier ways to get photos. - Not with me in them. Smile. Mr. Stacks! - Are you really doing this? - Yeah, won't even know she's there. - lt's like having a turtle. - l wonder if she has her shots. - How was your lunch? - What's your name? Her name is Annie, and she'll be staying with Mr. Stacks for awhile. He's going to adopt you? No, no, no. l have parents. This is just temporary. lf he gets approved. - What now? - Next. l need a temporary guardian approval, please. There is a six-week waiting period and you need form NYS 84-... Sweet Lord. Hi. Bam. You know, l don't normally do the site visits, but l've taken such a liking to young Annie. l forget sometimes, you know, why l got into this. lt's for my files. So, does the guardian have "adequate income to provide basic shelter"? l'm just gonna go ahead and check that box. Come on in. ...about $95 per share in cash and stock. ...detonated an explosive while fire... - Whoa. - Oh, yeah, whoa. Hey, is there a co-temporary guardian? - No. - Would you like a co-temporary guardian? Why don't l take these guys on a tour, and you can get back to work. Best idea of the day. l'll come with you. Will. Will, Will! Okay, so the state says that you must have at least one water source in... Check. And a window that's... Okay. And then at least one chair per 10 persons. And l think the Starship Enterprise is gonna count. l'm gonna check that box. How does it do this? lt's a smart house. So, it recognizes your voice and then adjusts itself accordingly. lt's like a friend. l consider it a friend. But l have real friends that aren't robots. Let's forget this conversation and the previous conversation and start afresh. Got that? Great. l'm gonna record your voice now, Annie, and it'll be in the system. So, just say something into this. - What should l say? - Anything. l think l'm gonna like it here. Got it. Great. lt's all yours. Have a go. And l'll be back. Ma'am? Excuse me. You are not allowed to go in there. This is very nice. Are those halogen bulbs? - Ma'am. - This sink is bigger than my entire country. l think l'm gonna like it here. I think I'm gonna like it I'm sure I'm gonna like it I think I'm gonna like it here So, think it and it shall appear I think I'm gonna like it here Because it knows just what you wanna see Wait, I think it and it comes to me?

No, thank you. We're just waiting on someone. l'm not looking for temporary companionship. Not judging you. God has a path for us all. - Your path should be away from the car. - What? Ma'am, wanna move away from the car, please? How dare you... Oh, really, you're gonna spray me? You think you're better than me? ls that what it is? You think you're better than me? l do. l do think l'm better than you. - Hey, Miss Hannigan. - What? l just wanna thank you for everything you've done for me. You think your life is a fairy tale? There is no happily ever after. And the worst thing is to get a little taste of something good 'cause it never lasts. And then all you can taste from then on out is not that taste. Just let her talk when she gets like this, remember? Shut up! Colleen Hannigan! H-bomb! Like me on Facebook! l don't like you in Harlem. Why would l like you on Facebook? Come on, rats, let's go! - lnside! - Bye, Annie. Bye. - What was that? - Don't worry about it. All right, Nash, we can take off. l can't, there's a truck. Bogey on your left, Nash, bogey on your left. Steady. No, thank you. l'm not looking for companionship. - What is it with this neighborhood? - No, that's Lou. - You know her name? - lt's a he. - Hey, girl. - Hey. l got you something. No, thanks. Those things are evil. They steal your private information so that big business can spy on you and crush your soul. Really? l'm happy for you though, mija. - Getting off the block. Take care. - Bye, Lou. Stay warm, Mr. Stacks. Sorry. He just doesn't like you. A lot of people don't like me. That's why we're doing this. Don't worry, l got a game face. Let's take some photos. My opponent wants to be mayor for two reasons. To feed his ego, and bolster his business interests. And now he coincidentally takes in a foster kid? Come on. Don't pee in my ear and tell me it's hot rain. Are you saying Annie is a political move? I'm surprised he hasn't gotten a dog yet. Are you sure l can have one? - No. - Yes. Look, kids love dogs. Come on, they see them on the street and they all go... - Am l right? - Hello. - You know, women do the same thing. - Hello. Hello. What about that one? She was separated from her pack too early. She just needs a little love. Don't pick that one, it's licking its own hoo-hah. Hey, girl, we found each other. l'll never leave you again, l promise. Annie, what are you gonna name it? She's like a hurricane. Sandy. Her name's gonna be Sandy. l told you. - Annie, will you take a picture with us? - Sure. Thanks, Annie. She really likes you. Look. Hey. Something wrong? Couldn't sleep. So quiet up here. - What you doing? - l'm working. - This late? - Always. - When do you have fun? - This is fun. l haven't been to Disneyland, but l don't think they have a paperwork ride. Look, if you're hungry, there's not a lot of food here. Only takeout. Fridge. Cool. Knock yourself out. You don't have a cook? Or like a million servants? Nope, l don't. l like to be alone. So why do you need all this space? 'Cause l like to be alone with a lot of space. Look, l think people surround themselves with other people just so they can feel loved. l don't believe in that. l believe the people that actually love you, you can count them on one hand. You know you're making a fist. Whatever. Where are your people? Wow, you ask a lot of questions, little one. My people aren't around. - You don't want new ones? - l'm good. You know what? l am hungry. l can make a meal out of anything. Pick five ingredients. - l don't want to. - Come on, this'll be fun. - Annie, listen, l don't have time... - Not work, but almost as fun. All right. Fusilli, pancetta, steak, pomegranate, truffle, sun-dried tomatoes. - l've only heard of two of those things. - Google it. - Okay, where are your pots and pans? - Pots and pans. l know. - Cool. - Cool. Put some in there. - Put in some carrot? - You're not gonna chop that carrot? You lactose-intolerant? l'm kid-intolerant. - How's your cholesterol? - lt's good right now. l'm gonna go downstairs and get some supplies. See you later. Orange you glad l'm back? The sixth ingredient is my jokes. Order up. - Are we really doing this? - Cheers. You gotta be kidding me. Sorry, it's gross. But you gotta learn to stop spitting. You're not a camel. Guy has this crazy idea that l should take you to a movie premiere tomorrow night. A movie premiere? Yes. - Can l bring my friends? - There's more of you? More photos. Click, click. All right. More photos. More photos. - lt's worse the second time. - Yeah. This is kind of like a bunk bed. - Morning, Annie. - Good morning, Nash. l know this sounds crazy, but do you guys spy on people with your phones? Why? l really need to find some people. Come with me. Come on, you got it. There you go. Stacks Mobile Control Center. We can trace every call, every data transmission made on every carrier over the past 20 years. Whoa. People shouldn't be scared of governments. They should be scared of cell phone companies. - Check for Bennett. - Checking. That's a lot of Bennetts. Can you please go back six years? Around the 26th Precinct. lt'll take a bit, but we'll let you know. Thanks. Oh, my God! Did Hannigan catch you? No, she's passed out. Things that make you go glug-glug. Mr. Stacks, who are you wearing? Armani. Annie, who are you wearing? This is my friend lsabella's, and this l think l found somewhere. Annie, how'd you like the French toast you had for breakfast this morning? Wait. How'd you know that? l started you a Twitter account. 1.3 million followers so far. You get it? "4realz." Because she's "for reals." - All right. - You get it, right? Hey! Stacks Phones! Never drop a call. And vote for me, too. Things happen for a reason. Says the boy who doesn't have to go home to the moon every night. Then don't go. You know it's not my choice. What the hell is happening? - Her moon tears are running out. - Of course they are. Then I'll make it my choice. Did you just grab yourself? You're buzzing. It's your phone. Hey, it's one of our phones. It's time. - That cost us $500,000. - What? Product placement. lt's the only thing that's keeping the movie business afloat. Execute your orders and return to the queendom. You succeed, and your mother will be set free. If not... We are ready down there. Once the moon sets, we will attack. Thanks, Sakana. What is going on? - The fish are going to attack the moon. - But they should attack already. There's not gonna be enough time for Kyle and Saffron to get away from the Luna Monsters. Attack, Sakana, attack! Quiet. Sakana, Sakana! Sakana! Sit down. l can't believe Sakana told on them. Of course you can. You can't trust the fish people. Gwarklark warned them. l think she was bluffing. Nah, it was a warning. They come back in the next movie. - There's a next movie? - There're four more. Shut up! - Whoa! - Cool! l gotta get back to work. You can't stay for the party? No. l haven't worked in two hours and three of my men think l'm dead. l'm alive. You've worked enough. lf your building gets any taller it's gonna hit the sun. You got this crazy way of turning a no into a yes. How do you do that? l think when people say no, they're just really scared of saying yes. Well, l'm not scared. No! - Please! - No! - Please. - Yes. - Yes! - Come on! Listen. l don't know. - Well, okay. - This is amazing. Mr. Stacks! Will! l can't believe how long you've been here. We're gonna be late for the Jets-Giants game. You're doing the ceremonial coin flip. And remember, they're both New York teams, so, heads or tails, you gotta be equally happy and sad. You're right. You go, l'll stay here with the kids. - You sure? - Yeah. All right, come on, let's go. What is that? Look, Tessie! Can we make one more stop? - Sure. - Don't wake up Hannigan. - Bye! - Bye, girls! You come here every Friday? lt's the only day they serve cannoli. And that's all you've got to go on? Do you think you'll remember what they look like? l think l'll just know. What are you doing still up? Where did you get all of this stuff? Where'd you get it? Where'd you get it? We went with Annie to the movies, and we got candy and soda, and we went ice skating, and Mr. Stacks is so cool, and l got fish earrings. Nice, Tessie. l can't keep a secret. l got fish earrings. Pack it up. lt's going back. - Why? - Because you don't deserve it. Yes, we do. lt's from our friend. She's not your friend. And neither is Mr. Stacks. They're all just a bunch of parasites who suck the life out of you and move on once you're not the shiny new object in the Factory anymore. You're being mean. l'm being educational! Now pack it up! You look ridiculous. l didn't fall. ...reptile in the bathtub. Mama. Little girls, little girls Everywhere I turn I can see them Little girls, little girls Night and day I eat, sleep and breathe them Get out of here! I should be anywhere but here Private planes, on the stage or MTV But I find myself here at the snot house Little shoes, little socks Please kill me. l'm serious, please kill me. l'm not singing, l'm asking. Locked in a cage with all the rats I've slipped through the cracks And now I'm stuck with the scraps And I can't seem to find my way back Get me out, get me out of here Oh, get her out I'm ready for stardom after all these years I'm done with little girls I wanna be someone in this world Little girls, little girls Everywhere I turn I can see them Little girls, little girls Night and day I eat, sleep and breathe them Get out of here! Locked in a cage with all the rats I've slipped through the cracks And now I'm stuck with the scraps And I can't seem to find my way back Oh, get me out, get me out of here Oh, throw me a rope I'm ready for stardom after all these years I'm done with little girls I wanna be someone in this world Little girls, little girls Oh, my God. That was beautiful. Your voice matches your beauty. You sound like a church bell, if it was stuck on top of a beautiful woman, or if a beautiful woman was inside a church bell. Not that you look like a church bell. That's not what l'm saying. If you looked like a church bell, l'd go to church every day. What? l got you a T-shirt, and you're gonna love it. Here, you ready? Here. What... lt's not your color? Not your size. l got more in the store. You know what l'm talking about, the church bell, right? Cannoli. One for your pretty friend. Thank you. - Sorry, kid. - lt's okay. Can you not tell Mr. Stacks about this? l don't want to bother him with it. Sure. He's worked selflessly his entire life for New York. From his first job teaching in inner-city schools, to his 25 year stint on the City Council... - Whose voice is that? - l don't know. Endorsed by The New York Times, the New York Post, and me, Michael J. Fox. Michael J. Fox? lt's over. We're finished. lf Michael J. Fox endorses him, then l'll vote for him. Listen to me, Michael J. Fox is not as great a guy as you think. Oh, no, no. Come on, he's a saint. - l hear there's a tape. - Forget it. l don't wanna hear it. - You've plateaued. - Michael J. Fox. Pay attention. Follow the little green dot. - That's you there. - l don't need a pointer to read a graph. Well, read this. Annie's taken you as far as she can, okay? But it's not over. - How bad do you want this? - l don't start things l can't win. Well, how far are you willing to go? Or should l say, how far do you want me to go? l pay you a lot of money for you not to ask me those types of questions. Okay, Guy-O? Rat-a-tat-tat, message received, boss. - Good morning. - Made you breakfast. You made me breakfast. Hey, l was thinking maybe you would wanna go in to work with me today. - Cool. - That'd be cool? - l'll go make us drinks. - All right. Don't let your food get cold. Okay. l won't. This is amazing. Annie, you really outdid yourself. Annie, this is a triumph, honey. You got me eating this thing up like a dog. This is good. What is it? Paprika, oregano. What is... What is that, Gouda cheese? You wanna know what's Gouda? This breakfast. Cool, a helicopter! Yeah. - Make sure you duck! - Why? l don't know. They always duck in the movies! Hop on up. All right. Here we go. Do you get airsick? Don't know. l've never been in the air before. l threw up on the swings once. Annie, we're gonna do a cell tower check. Make sure they're all working. You do that yourself? Yep, told you work was fun. Gilbert, let's roll. You'll be all right. You wanna know the secret to "Never drop a call"? Not really. Yes, yes, l do. Desperately. Good. See, we have five times as many cell towers as the other guys. But we hide them in plain sight. Like right there. You see? No. lt's in her crown. Yeah! That's so cool. lt's beautiful, isn't it? How'd you do this? How'd you become king of the world? Well, l wouldn't say king of the world. But l work my butt off. The harder l work, the more opportunities l get. See, you gotta play the cards that you've been dealt, no matter how bad the cards are. What if you don't have any cards? Then you bluff. See, that's what l love about this city. No matter who you are or what you are, you just gotta want it bad enough, and work with what you got. This is just the start of your story If you got guts, you'll get glory Anyone can make their dreams come true In New York City And now's the time you gotta stand tough 'Cause if you work hard, you can rise up Anyone can make it, even you In New York City Look at me, I'm just blood pumpin' You and me are two hearts thumpin' We are two souls feeling the same beat So take it all, the city's yours It's worth fighting for It's all yours So take it all The city's yours It's worth fighting for It's all mine It's all yours Why don't you go above 96th Street? No reason. Gilbert, go uptown. This is my New York City. Where'd you live? Everywhere. - l see a cell tower! - Where? See it? Right there. Right under that devil bird. Good eyes. You know, Annie, sometimes what you're looking for is right in front of your face. In New York City - So take it all - So take it all - The city's yours - The city's mine - Worth fighting for - It's worth fighting for - It's all mine - It's all mine - So take it all - So take it all - The city's yours - The city's mine - Worth fighting for - It's worth fighting for - It's all mine - It's all mine It's all yours In New York City Grace. What's our presence past 96th Street? Well, we're mostly focused below, but l've been saying for a while we should try... No, but l had it this way. Let me do this. l've got it. l know what l'm doing. Miss Farrell? - lt arrived. Thanks. - What's that? l bought a dress for Annie to wear to the event tonight. lt's gorgeous. l just need you to tie the bow and make sure that the satin... - l tie the bow? - Yeah. - l'm dressing her? - You just have to tie the bow. No, l... What kind of bow? - lt's just a simple bow. - Like a slipknot? - 'Cause you know l didn't take Boy Scouts. - lt's very easy, Will. - And have the satin facing out. - The satin? - Yeah. - l knew a girl named Satin. l'm sure you did. You don't need to elaborate. - Satin and bows is not necessarily my... - You know what? l'll come over. - Yeah, l mean, either way. - Great. She's gonna look gorgeous. Annie. You did not... - You didn't see anything? - l didn't see anything. Good. Good. 'Cause l... Well, l don't know. l thought l saw you... Nope! Here the whole time. What were you guys doing? Just hanging out? - Hi. - Evening. Wow. Grace, you look great. Please. You look handsome, lovely. - No. - Yes. This is old. This is my grandmother's. lt's nothing. Your grandmother is hot. l mean, not that l've... l've never seen your grandmother. l'm not... l'm saying that the dress is nice. Well, you're sweet. You look good. So do you. Let's go and get you dressed. Let's go! Her dressed. l was already dressed. - Come on! - Yes. - Come on. - Yeah. Get some... - Ready? - Yes. l'm very excited. Annie, it's gorgeous. You're just gorgeous. l can't believe it. All right, ladies, let's go. Let's go. We're running late. Annie! Wow. l know, right? l've never seen a bow this big. Yes, and l noticed that you put the satin on the outside of the bow. That's a very interesting choice. You know what? Get out of here. We're not done yet. You know what? When did this stop being my house? - Out! - Okay, fine. You know what? You're changing everything. As a matter of fact, this used to be a Basquiat. Now it's a dog and a deer in a meadow. Why is that combination so cute? Come on. Let's do your hair. Why aren't you and Mr. Stacks together? That's a complicated question. Not really. Do you like him? Well, you know, l work for him. You know, liking him doesn't really come into play. Okay. l mean, is he my friend? Yes. Do l find him attractive? Sure. And not just in the physical sense. But he is very good-looking. He's got lovely shoulders and a great, chiseled face. Lovely lips. Good hair. l wouldn't bank on the hair, sister. Well, l'm far too busy to be bothered with anything like that anyway, so... That sounds like something Mr. Stacks would say. Yeah, it does, doesn't it? When my friend Pepper liked this boy at school, she punched him in the face. She got suspended, but they play in the park together now. Sometimes l'd like to punch Mr. Stacks in the face. l'm just meaning punching. That's it. l just want to punch him. He's annoying. Thanks for doing this, Will. Your name's gonna look great up there. Now, you sure the Guggenheims are okay with me taking their name off? You gave me 100 million reasons not to care. Did they find anything on my parents? No, not yet. And we dug real deep. l'm sorry. Thanks for trying. Annie! Annie, come on! Annie, Annie! New Yorkers face challenges every single day. Challenges that seem insurmountable. We all tell ourselves "no" a lot. We say, "No, I won't get that job," or, "No, I can't afford college." Unless it's you, Franklin, coming from the mean streets of Martha's Vineyard. Hey! Yeah. Let's change those noes to yeses. Because when we say no, we're actuallyjust scared to say yes. So, let's start saying yes to ourselves, and let's say yes to a brighter future. Now, many of you know that I've had a visitor staying with me recently. She only knows the word "yes." Annie? Could you come up, please? Go on. You'll be great. Go on, darling. Swallow your shrimp, Annie. Now, Annie, I don't wanna embarrass you. I just want everyone to see what the future of our city is all about. Now, do you have anything you want to say to these good people that are just oozing with liberal guilt? Except for you, Senator. I know you're trying to build that fence. I can't believe I'm here. I'm in a dress that feels like a cloud. I'm standing in the middle of a giant cinnamon roll. With a band that has little violins, big violins, one of those. A piano. Mr. Stacks has taught me so much. He's given me such a big opportunity. Under the glow of the very bright lights I turn my face towards the warm night skies And I am not afraid of a thousand eyes When they're above five hundred smiles Oh, I used to think Oh, she used to think What wouldn't I give What wouldn't she give For a moment like this This moment, this gift Now look at me And this opportunity Is standing right in front of me But one thing I know It's only part luck and so I'm putting on my best show Under the spotlight I'm starting my life Big dreams becoming real tonight So look at me and this opportunity You're witnessing my moment, you see? My big opportunity Oh, I used to think Oh, she used to think What I wouldn't give What wouldn't she give For a moment like this This moment, this gift And now look at me And this opportunity Is standing right in front of me But one thing I know It's only part luck and so I'm putting on my best show Under the spotlight I'm starting my life Big dreams becoming real tonight So look at me and this opportunity You're witnessing my moment, you see? My big opportunity I won't waste it I guarantee. Take a bow. That was great. - Now read my speech. - What? That speech l wrote you. My speech. lt's right there. ls everything all right? l'll make it bigger for her. There it is. "Thank you, Mr. Stacks." - Hold on a second. - No. Annie, is everything okay? Leave me alone. Annie! Annie! Annie? This is your big opportunity To vote for William Stacks Annie. Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Annie! Hey! Wait, Annie. Slow down. What are you doin'? - Annie. - Wait, wait, wait. l got it. - What's going on? - lt's nothing. Young lady, you're have to tell me what's going on with you now! No, l don't! You're not my dad. Wow. Well, l know that. l know l'm not your dad. But l would like to know what's going on with you. l can't read. What do you mean you can't read? l've watched you read, Annie. Maybe you were just nervous. Sorry l ruined your shrimp event. - What happened? - l don't know. She freaked out. Hey, what were you two talking about earlier? She asked me to help her find her parents, but it was a dead end. Even asked some of my old buddies on the force. There's nothing on that kid. Her parents. Genius. - Annie, what's wrong? - Get back! Hey, hey, get back! - Grace! - Get back! - Nash! - Hey! - Make room! - She's a kid. Get back. She's a kid. - Come on. - Get back. She's a kid! Who is it? It's Guy Danlily. I work for Will Stacks. Come in. Hello there. Colleen Hannigan? That's my maiden name. But l'm not married to it, if you know what l mean. Can l buy you another drink? So, if he wins, l get paid a fortune. More than anything l've ever been paid combined. Why so much? lt's like getting paid long odds on a dark horse. Do you know how hard it is to get Will Stacks elected? "Never drop a call." What does that even mean? Everybody texts now. There have been worse politicians than him. l know. l got them elected. Schwarzenegger, Kim Jong-ll, that blood diamonds guy. - What? - But l'm over it. l'm tired of being the cockroach everybody needs, but treats like a... - Cockroach? - Exactly. This is my last roll at the table. Get paid and get out. There's no such thing as a way out. Trust me. There's always a way out. Trust me. And in this particular case, it's all about finding Annie's parents. You know, I'm tired of being the black hat Of running the show down in the snake pit Are you singing to me? So this is our chance to get out of this place ls this really happening? So come on, let's run for it to Easy street Where you sleep till noon Yeah, yeah, yeah lf Stacks reunites Annie with her parents, 80% surge in the polls for sure. We talked about this already. They don't exist. We'll make them exist. Find a couple people to pretend to be her parents. They learn every detail and miraculously show up right before the election. Add water, instant parents. What's in it for me? Same as for me. Ka-ching. And no more being a cockroach. Yeah, I'll be the girl who's dripping in jewelry The crowds'll go wild when I sing I won't have to look out on a fire escape Two. The view will be billboards of me - On easy street - On easy street - Easy street - Easy street To a way out. - Where we all get paid - Where we all get paid - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah - Yeah, yeah, yeah - Move them feet to - Move them feet to - Easy street - Easy street - When you get there - When you get there - Stay - Stay l knew l liked you. Okay, we're not doing that right now. That's fine. YOLO, YOLO. That's fine. To easy street. l've been telling her she can do anything she wants to do in this city, and come to find out she can't even read. How does that happen? A lot of kids get lost, Will. A lot of people get lost. Well, it's unacceptable. We gotta get her a tutor. For her, though, right? Not just for the press. For her. What? l can feel you smiling with those Britisher-than-thou lips. Your secret's safe with me, Batman. - What secret? - That you care about her. l care about the kids that are in New York City. And Annie. Well, she lives in New York. So, therefore, she's cared for. lt's a blanket... She's within the structure of the whatever. Annie? Where you going? Thanks for everything. Sorry l messed up last night. Hope you can still be mayor. What are you talking about? Get back here. lt's okay. l'm good at this part. l've had a lot of practice getting kicked out of places. Annie. Listen, put your bag down. You're not going anywhere. - Sandy's gotta go. - Stop it. You and Sandy are staying here, and l don't care what happened last night. No, l mean Sandy's gotta go. No, l mean... Sandy's gotta go. Okay. - Well, is it champagne or gelato? - What? ls it Mountain Dew or is it just plain old doo? ls it lemonade or chicken nuggets? l should go. Now l wanna go because my bladder's full. Come on, let's go. l saw you sign your name. That's all you gotta know how to do. But what about your teachers? How is this possible? l'm good at hiding it. Okay, at home. They didn't catch it at home? "At home"? How come you didn't tell anybody about this? lt's not like the whole world wants a foster kid to begin with. And plus, it's embarrassing. l didn't want anyone to know. You know what? l wanna show you something. This is good here. - Where are we? - Queens. Do l need my passport? Truth is, Annie, everybody's got something that they don't want anybody to know. lncluding me. For me, this is it. This is my family. Can you see them right now? No, l don't. l see them in my mind. Like this part of the track right here? This is where my father worked 20 hours a day. Work, and work, and work, and work. And then he died. l was 12 years old. What was he like? l don't know. l barely knew him. He was always working. And that's why l felt like if l worked hard enough, then that'd probably bring me closer to him. And that's why l developed this. Well, now, you got this. Yeah, all right, Annie. You know, this pollen or something's got my eyes all scratchy. Let's walk this way. We can see where the trains go. lt's so good to see you after all these years! Yo, suit. No cuts, no butts, no coconuts. You gotta sign in. - For what? - The auditions. Audition? Oh, my God! Wait! "We've been trying so hard to find you!" - Where is she? - Back there. Why? Wait! Hey! Stop! Stop! Wait! That's an interesting choice. "Oh, darling girl! lt's so good to see you after all these years!" "We've been trying so hard to find you, "and then we saw pictures of you with the nice man running for mayor." "Let's sing our special song only us three know." Locket! The sun will come out Pronto! - Bet your sweet bottom, fella, that - Bet your sweet bottom, fella, that Pronto! There'll be sun! What the hell is this? A disaster. You're garbage. You're pitchy. - Next! - Come on. - l really like the script. - David Kramer says hello! - Out! - That hack. What are you doing? You told me to find two people to play her parents. l meant some friends or some neighborhood toughs. Not open auditions. These are callbacks. l know, right? - And why are they singing? - People love musicals. Bursting into song for no apparent reason. lt's magical! There's a window There's a bed Here's a table There's your head Okay. You're done. l'll take care of finding the parents. You don't do anything. l'll call you when l need you. - But... - No buts. We're running out of time. - Touch the sign! - l did it! You ever see Casper the Friendly Ghost throw up? No. Would you like a marshmallow? Psych! How about a graham cracker? You son of a... You make me laugh. Hey, Grace. Let me ask you something. Exactly how hard would it be to become a foster parent? And not temporarily either. More like a... Well, you know, permanent situation. You mean, adopt Annie? Yeah, well, whatever the word is. That's the word, Will. Then... Yeah. Sandy. We slept in the bed. Which one do you prefer, Will? Red. lt's been two hours. l don't think she's completely learned to read yet. Yeah, well, not completely, but... Will! Will! We got our game changer. Every election needs a game changer. We got our game changer. - Stop saying "game changer." - Annie's parents. They saw her picture, and they called us. lt's a miracle. "Game changer." Apparently, they've been looking for her for years, but she's not in the system. How do they know she's their daughter? Well, they know everything about her. They know about the locket, the note, and oh, yeah, l ran a DNA test. Boom goes the dynamite. DNA test. All right, but don't tell her. l wanna meet them before Annie finds out. I wouldn't have it any other way. I mean, you should totally be the one who tells Annie that we found her parents! You found my parents? - Yes, honey, we did. Well, we think so. - Really? Yeah. We're gonna meet them at a place called the Domani. - That's where the note is from! - No way! l knew they'd come for me. l'm happy for you, Annie. l know this is what you always wanted. And it's all because of you. l can't believe l'm gonna see my parents. l'm kind of freaking out. Annie! Annie! Over here! Are you happy? Are you happy? - Very happy for you. - Thanks. Annie, The Reunion. - Annie. - My girl. ls it a match? Let's see, huh? lt's a match. - We thought we'd lost you forever. - Me, too. We fell upon hard times. We just felt it was best for someone else to look after you. l figured. l've never forgiven myself for it. But when we got back on our feet, well, we just couldn't find you, kid. But the angels were looking out. - Where do you live? - New Jersey. But we're moving to Brazil for my job. - l think you're gonna like it there. - Cool. Okay, let's get started. Everything is in order. We have the DNA test signed by the judge. Now, we just need signatures of the parents. - That's you guys. - That's us. Ma'am, sign right there. Hey. Remember me from before? - You know what, l do. - That's right. l didn't know that you were Annie's foster mom. - Amongst other things. - l know. She said that you're a very good singer. What'd she say? "She's a really good singer." No, she didn't do any of that. She just said you have a very nice voice, and she liked it. - She did? - Yep. Said it made her feel good about herself. Thank you, Rodney. The guardian of record. That's you, stretch. Come on. Right here. You sure about this? That this is gonna win you the election? Yeah. No. Annie. You don't pay me to worry about her. And the current temporary guardian, William Stacks. Mr. Stacks, we meet again. That is a very big pen. Thank you. Okay. Well, according to the State of New York, you are officially reunited. - Yay! - Great! - We'll pick you up at 4:00. - Great. All right. What were they like? Hey! Wait! How did you do the DNA test? You can do anything with money. Well, who are those people, and what's your plan with her, anyhow? Don't worry about it. She served her purpose. What does that mean? That they'll hold her for a while then dump her back in the system till after the election. No harm, no foul. You can't do that to her. l mean, she's still a little girl. What do you care? Look, just go home and keep your mouth shut. Hey! You can't talk to me like that. l know things about you. Well, if you know what's good for you, you'll go home, and keep your mouth shut. Mr. Stacks! Has it helped you in the polls? Hey, folks, Mr. Stacks is thrilled for Annie and her family. Never drop a citizen. Vote Stacks for mayor. Annie! Annie! Did you enjoy seeing them?

What's the matter, sweetie? What did you do? 'Cause, whatever it is, you know l'm here to help. Why are you so nice to me, the way l treat you?
