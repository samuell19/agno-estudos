A Nichiei Shinsha Production Nagasaki Swallowtail (Papilio memnon) is known in Japan as a naturalized butterfly of tropical origin. It mainly feeds on Zabon (pomelo) as it hatches from egg to larva, changes from larva to chrysalis and transforms into a butterfly.

But I want you to understand. I can't believe what can't be true. See? This butterfly... of all swallowtails, Mikado Swallowtail and Nagasaki Swallowtail, especially Nagasaki Swallowtail of southern tropical origin is an example of naturalized species in Japan. See? This butterfly is native to the southern tropics. You're a Dosanko (Hokkaido native). This is Hokkaido. That butterfly can only be found at the southern end of Japan. How did it make it to Hokkaido? Let's suppose it flew over on its own. Look here. From Nagasaki... to Hokkaido. Straight-line distance is... a hundred and... sixty centimeters. Flying over the sea. This map's on a scale of 1 to 1,000,000. So that makes it... 1600 kilometers. That butterfly flew a distance of 1600 km? Also, a Nagasaki Swallowtail mainly feeds on zabon leaves. In Hokkaido, we don't even have tangerines, let alone zabons. No chance at all. Gets really cold in winter, right? But it's beautiful. I presume it would have cost a fortune. (University of Hokkaido) Your teacher... asked me to explain til you fully understand. You get it? Your teacher admires your enthusiasm. During the 1910s, in Sussex, England, a mysterious ancient human skull was found in a place called Piltdown. It was named the Piltdown Man after the place of discovery. Now, as people tried to classify this Piltdown Man, they realized that the whole system of anthropology has turned out to be completely false. For that reason, for over 40 years until the 1950s, it has remained a subject of controversy among experts around the world. However. It was exposed that this skull was a complete hoax. When analyzed using isotope techniques, it was revealed that, although part of the skull was genuine, the lower jawbone was a chimpanzee's. It was a fake. Someone made up this fake skull. Perhaps no offense was intended. Just a thought of how exciting it would be if the early man looked like this. But as a result, for as long as 40 years, experts around the world were left perplexed. That person is to be blamed. I don't want you to misunderstand, but you... Did you kill it? This is a dead butterfly. It is no more a butterfly. A butterfly is supposed to be flying. Dead, it is. If you really believe it was flying, then it was flying. You don't need other people to confirm it to you. Anyway... the dead can't speak anymore. NAGASAKI Nagasaki Swallowtail's larva Nagasaki. Terminus, Nagasaki. Next train bound for Tokyo. Thank you for waiting. Next train to Tokyo is ready to depart. Please stay behind the white line. Train to Tokyo is ready to depart from Platform 2. Please step back behind the white line. This train will stop next at Isahaya. HAGI I missed you. I feel like being left alone. What for? What have I been doing? I have nothing. Nothing. It's been 200 years... since this house was built. Now you tell me you're not sure. You'll be finished, too. That's for sure. It's just unforgivable to cling on to the dead. At that point... I was certain about what I had in mind. Grab what you can and let's go. We'll be fine. I'll talk to the professor in Hiroshima and ask for assistance. For that, we need money. I love you. I love you. I need you. Why else could I do such a thing? What will become of me, then? I want you to leave. "Hagi" "Murders Husband" "Accomplice" HIROSHIMA 'Protest against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs' 'Restore Japan-China diplomatic relations' 'Defeat Ikeda' 'Council Against A & H Bombs' Fellow citizens... we are... ... regional delegates of... ... on a peace march... 'Striptease' Two ice creams. "Hagi Wife Murders Husband" "Accomplice? Lover on the Run?" I saw it. No you didn't. I saw it. Clearly. You fool. She wouldn't show it. That Mimi's hot. Damn! I wanna do it with her. That babe... You mean, Mimi? Doesn't she look like Toyoko Yamamoto from 6th grade? She was pretty good at math... looked a bit like Yoko Tsukasa. No way. Anyway, Toyoko Yamamoto is now in hospital with Pika-Don (atomic bomb) syndrome. Hmm. Didn't you say you'll visit her at the hospital to give her origami cranes? Blah! Who cares. Everyday we're stained black with oil. And we're getting paid peanuts. Back then... I tried to hold you back against your will. I didn't understand. I thought... you didn't love me anymore. Still living in that apartment? Yes. Like it used to be when you left. Remember? When you first came to that room... you said there's no mirror and laughed. The Yoshiokas, our neighbor now have a baby. That was also in summer. All of a sudden, you went back to Hiroshima. That afternoon, in the glaring sun. It's a lie to say the sun is blinding. I'm at a loss... and hopeless... living a life without you. Harsh and intense... were you, back then. I beg you please. Let's go back to Tokyo together. Don't say that. Everyone's enduring hardship. How can I get away from who I am now? Who you are...? From who you are. Only folks like you could say that. Folks like you? Why are you... trying to stay within your own shell? No. I am... free. By 'free'... you mean... giving me the cold shoulder? You've got it wrong. I... love you too. I've never forgot you, even for a day. That is exactly why... why... I want you to understand. I want you... to understand. See how things change? What things? Certain things. That is... however... inevitable. No. That is... what is important. I love you. My mother's bone. After 19 years, what I felt that day on August 6th hasn't changed a bit. When I heard the siren tears came from the bottom of my heart. An overwhelming feeling of a hibakusha (A-bomb survivor). It's not about anger, sorrow nor pain. It's there. Something's inside our body to periodically bring back memories. I may be fine today, but you never know when the disease will eventually get you. You know, the A-bomb Survivors Hospital used to report every single death. But about 2 years ago, they stopped doing that as it might have serious psychological effects on other A-bomb survivors. They decided to withhold such reports. There are about 500 senior A-bomb victims. Bedridden grandpas and grandmas. Some of them are on welfare. There's a borderline between them and those who are rich. And most of the victims are those who fall right between. They live on a single tatami mat with no electricity. Though many others have managed to reintegrate into society, living and working like ordinary people. When you've experienced miscarriage you wonder if... your child's generation would be affected and are left confused. If... it were just me, I would endure any bitterness and hardship, but to think that it might affect the life of the future generation... I feel overwhelmed with anxiety. Hospital director Dr. Shigeto said the other day that you can't tell with certainty that there will be no effect at all. There might be some effect. He said a lot of things still remains to be clarified. And that is just unbearable. If only they would tell us that there definitely are effects, we would be able to somehow achieve an emotional closure... After all... for an A-bomb survivor, at times, life gets just intolerable. I guess every one of us is feeling this way. No matter how hard you try to reach out it's like calling out in the middle of the wide ocean - there's no response at all. It's like crying out to the sky - no one's there to answer you. So... you wonder when will come the time you can honestly feel it was good to be alive. KYOTO Here - a souvenir from Hiroshima. Sorry to have kept you waiting. What's this? A tapir. Eh? A tapir? A tapir eats your dreams. It ate up my dreams, too. Eat this mister's dreams too, would you? Mister's dream is... you. It's my dream to be with you like this. Racoon dog! We go eat something? Say what you want to eat. Do you like racoons? I do like tanuki-udon. ("racoon" noodles) But horses are my favorite. Article One. In a field gun crew, horses are far more valuable than men. Maintenance of hoofs: Hold the horse's legs with hands and knees, and turn the hoof up. Should any excrement be found it must be removed on the spot. A horse... fenced inside a zoo. Your mister's tired. Then, give me some money! I love you... I really love you. You're hurting my arm. Stop seeing the others and be mine, would you? Mine only. How much would you need a month? Life was tough, really tough. I spent my youth in the jungle, with nothing to eat. At first, we'd slaughter our horses, then... I love you... Your body... I love it... I love you. Anna... Anna. I love you. Anna! Did you eat the horses too? I will never die! I shouted to myself. I will never... Stop it! Slowly... I lifted my face up and found myself in front of a vast, quiet marsh. I was... stained with blood. I never wanted to do it. If it wasn't me, then it would've been someone else from my troop. Your family betrayed me. They were guerillas, guerillas! They almost got me. So I killed them. Your father, your mother, and your beloved younger brother. And you whom I loved so much. The entire village. So you hate me, right? You killed me! What's the matter with the way I lived my life? Sergeant Murano is alive and well! Here I am! Those who perished were dumb-asses. It was none of my fault. I wasn't like the others No, I wasn't like the others..... No! I wasn't, I wasn't, I.. A lonely butterfly Sings a song of green. Sings a song of A runaway love. Far in the blue sky Fly, fly, on the wind Go catch Your runaway love. The song of green goes La la la, li li li li... Carried by a golden bee Rides a boat of light. Trembling behind the mirror Flows through the blue of the night. Flowers... anyone wants some flowers? Flowers... anyone wants some flowers? OSAKA Next station is... Yodoyabashi. Come to think of it. Life with no turning points is a bore. Holds on to the strap, and his... cufflink is showing. So cool! Cufflink on the cuff of his snow-white shirt. Cool. And a watch on his wrist. You see him wearing a sleek pair of trousers. Never mixes weired socks with decent shoes. Can't help noticing them. Just looking at the shoes he's wearing, you can tell if he's got taste or not. Like... the degree of style. If he's got a nice jacket, chances are his shoes are fancy too. I know this other guy who spent all his spare time shining up his shoes. He couldn't stand having stains on his shoes. But it's a good thing, both for men and women to be conscious about fashion. That guy... can I mention his name? The branch office manager. I mean, he's really cool, isn't he? Yeah, he sure is. And he's handsome, too. - Don't know him. What's he like? - I heard he's very good at dancing. You mean the former manager? The one who always tells people they need a haircut, right? He's gorgeous. You know, he looks even cooler with his brown suit. Umm... what do you call that? Reddish brown? His suit. Yeah, that double-breasted suit. Sort of like.. really cool. Doesn't matter how old you are. You bet. Gorgeous. Any fun stuff lately? Seeing life as being 'ahorashi' (nonsense) is a critical problem. In Osaka dialect, feeling 'ahorashi' means you're barely hanging on. Just take an abacus. As a salaryman, with 20 more years to retirement, that 20 years' worth of salary would add up to 30 million. But... life with no turning points is a bore. So if you think about these 35 million, you just can't quit. At least, buck-wise. And you might think of a career shift, trying to act strong, which would't be impossible depending on the conditions, but then if you... just stick to what you're on to you'd get those 35 million. That's a whole lot of money. So to give that up would be just illogical, meaning that you're seeing your work as nonsense, something nauseating. That would be the only explanation you can give. Not to be confused with 'tsumannai' (boring) in Tokyo dialect which is totally different. 'Boring' just doesn't ring a bell. - So you're thinking it's nonsense? - Yeah. Nonsense. Why am I talking this here? You're an intellectual... well no, what... a petit bourgeois. You know what I heard? I heard him say 'small bourgeois.' Literally. Small bourgeois. Yeah... radical, small bourgeois. I love you. I love you. I love you, I love you, love, Love. I love you, I love you, love, Love. Yodoyabashi... arriving at Yodoyabashi. But... life without turning point is a bore. BUTTERFLY AS AN EAGLE, FLIES AMONG SWANS. How much did you make? 100... and 8. We need to go greedier. Minami's now saturated. Gotta expand into Kita. And the drugs? Tail, tail... tail. East, east, east, east. Tail, tail. Thirteen orphans, lacking 1 Bamboo. Pong, pong, pong, pong, jump jump and pong. Nothing more than what's needed in here. HONG KONG Here are the findings from the institute. Full investigation on the bag's content for items corresponding to the ciphers revealed a surprising fact... What was that? It was a worm. Worm hunch? BUTTERFLY AS AN EAGLE, FLIES AMONG SWANS. Please note the word 'butterfly.' Butterfly. The worm was identified as... a larva of a butterfly called Papilio memnon thunbergii Siebold. A purely Japanese species, Made in Japan. A larva of a butterfly with a common name of Nagasaki Ageha. Quick, give me the conclusion. A further exponential matching using this algorithm table completed by electronic computing yielded a conclusion that... The deal will succeed if we were to board the Eagle bound for Yokohama this evening. Estimated value is 2 billion yen. But the matter requires haste. The worm is our only clue. If we just sit around, the larva will grow into a butterfly. PORT OF YOKOHAMA The queen awakens. She has huge appetite. 2 billion yen. Both me... and you... my impoverished companion... abandoned our humble song... to set out on a distant journey. Isn't it about time to prepare a carriage now? My poor... thing. We get him? We're only after the worm. As stated within the research project, military affair will soon be given higher priority in the era to come. Heat is building up. Worm, worm, worm... Therefore, the motion is carried to seek approval for the conclusion of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. ... now past the 400 mark and heading to the straightway Which one is in the lead? Worm... Let's not stir things up, we'd better avoid getting both of us into trouble. Unless we can lead this to an outbreak of war. Worm... That strategy that you might be thinking about involves less interest, you know. Nevertheless, as soon as the cargo turns into butterfly everything comes to naught. A lonely butterfly Sings a song of green. Sings a song of A runaway love. Far in the blue sky Fly, fly, on the wind Go catch your Runaway love. The song of green goes La la la la la la la la... Carried by a golden bee Rides a boat of light. Trembling behind the mirror Flows through the blue of the night. Behind the shinig mirror Is a dead star. A baby of the rainbow Full of wrinkles. Behind the mirror Is an infinite silence. Silence has no wings. A tiny den. A lonely... butterfly Sings... a song... of green. Sing a song... of... a... runaway... love. Far in the blue sky Fly, fly, on the wind Go catch your Runaway love. (Ikebukuro, Tokyo) Hey. Gimme the worm. What? Just give it to me. What the hell? Don't play dumb! Eat this! Hey. Hey! Huh? Gimme the worm. Worm? What? What the... What's wrong? - Shot dead? - Gross! With a gun? Shot from both sides. Look at the blood. - Killer yakuzas? - This is horrible! In broad daylight. - They fled that way. - Somebody called an ambulance? Wasn't the one who shot from here a policeman? A cop? The police would do that?
