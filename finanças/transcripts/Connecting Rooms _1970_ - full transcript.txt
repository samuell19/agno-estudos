Wanda? If's Mickey. Can I come in a moment, it's terribly important. Hello, Princess. Yes? You have a room for rent? Oh, yes, dear. Come in, you come in. Would you mind waiting here, dear, while I go and get the keys? Bless you, Wanda, love. Play well tonight! Oh, it's two flights up, but there's a smashing view of the park. -Oh, Mr. Hollister. -Mrs. Brent. Don't forget to turn your lights out when you go out. Yes, ma'am. That was Mickey Hollister, he used to work in the shop {ill he met his Miss Fleming. Now he's a composer, you know, pop music. I don't know if he's any good or not. Oh, Miss Fleming, Miss Fleming, Miss Fleming! Can you hear me, dear? I do wish you'd practice at the theater, I'm not letting rehearsal rooms, you know. Oh, did you hear that, she's so clever. She's a great artist, not the ordinary sort you find in rooms. You know, the shabby type who always eat sardines for tea. Well, there it is, four pounds. In advance. I'll take it. Oh, I'm so glad, dear. And if you want anything, I'm in the basement. Always in the basement. Night and day. Good evening. Good evening. Don't scrape the walls, dear. She's gone to the theater. What do you do, dear? -I'm a schoolmaster. -Oh, really? -In London? -No, in the country. If you excuse me, I think I'd better go now-- In the country? But school started weeks ago, I know that by the kids next door. Now listen, dear, you are working, aren't you? Yes, I'm on an educational leave-- research, the British Museum. Oh, that's interesting. Well, the bell doesn't work, and if you want me, I'm in the basement. Taxi! Yes, Clifford Street, Mayfair, please. -Evening. -At last, -Good evening, Mr. Hollister. -Evening, Lou. Lou been looking after you, then? Yeah, sure he has. -Brandy, please, Lou. -And? And whatever Miss Hallam's having. -Mr. Grayson's waiting. -Oh, yeah? -Sorry darling, it's business. -Oh. It won't take long. -Evening, Dick. -Mickey. Thank you for coming. As you reminded me that I owe you, I came along- what's on your mind? -Claudia Fouchet, that's what. -Ch? Well, you manage her, don't you? -So? -80 she has been so wrongly. This--this is for her. So you want Claudia to record your song? -Yeah. -As a single, of course. Why, yes. Well, I must say it, you a certain nerve to go along with all your other charms. Now what about a track record? You know how she feels about unknowns. Come on, Dick, you're not telling me that she was born in the charts? Next you'll be telling me Bassey rode into town in a Rolls. -Why don't you try Bassey? -I don't know her manager. And anyway, even if I did, we wouldn't be— He doesn't owe me. No, Mickey. Its not on. She arrives late and she's got a tough schedule. Yes, I know, the full treatment, -London Aiport. -Nine o'clock. Oh, no you don't, stay away. Oh sure, sure. Anyway, no hard feelings, huh? -Good, but lay off it -Good, right. -Hello, Johnny. -Hi. - Need the car. -“What, again? -Listen, I sell cars— -Don't lend them, I know. Why don't you buy it, I'd be happy at just 200 down, -what do you say? -Somebody's arriving, I've got to be there. A bird, I suppose? -French, canary. -Okay. Al right, but for Christ's sake, don't pile it up on the motorway. The owner might get mad. Thank you. Hey. En? -Oh. -Where are we going, then? I'm sorry, we are not. Business— but it won't take long, and anyway, Johnny's a swinger. Well, you got to admit it, the boy's got style. Style? Who else could borrow a car and dump a girl all in one breath? Well, looks like you're stuck with me. “Where to, then? -Does it matter? Stand by, she's here. -Good evening, Madam. -Good evening. Miss Fouchet, can I say you're looking forward -to the concert? -This one's for Edith, -Please, Miss Fouchet. -Thank you. Hold it please, Miss Fouchet, Just one more. Very well, Madam, but it'll take a moment.

Well, I don't come that easy, no, but it could be arranged. Could also very easily be arranged to have you thrown out. Yes, it could, but why should you? Except to please Dick Grayson. -So you're Mickey? Mmm. Hmm. -Richard told me about you. -Did he, now? Lock, he must have told you how I feel. I don't know how you found me but I'm very tired, 50 either you go or [I call the desk. No, don't bother. Just let me leave you with something. It's the least a man can do. Just look it aver. Now say get out. -Get out. -Right. I'll be in touch, Miss Fouchet.

Is there anything you need? -No, no thank you. -Tea, coffee? -Perhaps another pillow? No. -Mrs. Brent's beds are shacking. -No, no, thank you. Thank you very much, excuse me, goodnight. Goodnight. -Princess! -Mickey! What's happening in the outside world? You should ask! Publishers, agents, I'm up to here with 'em. Sometimes I wish I were back in the shop. Then the only writing I had to do was in the cash book. But this pop world's a jungle. You can have it Well then, don't do it. You're capable of being whatever you want to be, and you know I'll help you as much as I can. Did you have a good performance tonight? Oh, yes, people are very kind. Oh, you're lucky--you're happy. -You're not? -Oh, how can you ask? No money, no background, living in a dump on the wrong side of the park. And me being so class conscious. Just my luck, born in Ealing. Well, I'm sure there are worse places. Not where I come from, we're opposite a fish and chip shop. Mm, if my friends knew, they think I'm from a good school, wealthy parents. So you're not, is that a drawback? I want to be filthy rich. Oodles of it! Tell me, Mickey. Is there anything more important 10 you than money? Uh, some things are all right, I guess. How could anything be Just "all right'? Have convictions. Without convictions, life's just a banana. Mr. Prescott used to say, "Life's like a coffee grinder, and we're the coffee beans." Oh, I've a new neighbor in Mr. Prescott's room. -He's very distinguished. -Yes, I saw him. I mean, I am a burden-- Well, I try not to cost you, I've even started doing my own laundry at the laundromat. Just think, my fire goes out, I need a shilling for the meter, I meet you, I know. Princess, you're very pretty. Oh, thank you. But I've never made love to you. Don't you have needs, Princess? Oh, Mickey, stop. Oh, now you're angry with me. Oh, you'd never consider it, not now. Consider what? Princess... Lend me 200 pounds. Oh, you're funny. Well, flat feet aren't funny, I'm getting 'em from all the walking I'm doing. -I need a car. -A car? “Where'd you walk to? -All over the place, like an ancient courier going from village to village, it's medieval! Well, there's always London transport. A bus? What if my friends saw me? It's only 200 pounds and I swear I'll repay it. Pound by pound. I don't have 200 pounds. What about your post office savings? Well, that's for my old age. Oh, you'll never be old. Two more days, my birthday. Your birthday? But don't tell me, let me guess. Bet you're not more than 35, 36 at the most. Oh now, don't be absurd, I'm old. Such an old little girl. Tell you what, you buy a bottle of champagne, and I'll come and drink it with you after your show. That would be lovely. How'd you know about my post office savings? Oh, nosing around, you know me. Oh God, oh God. Oh! An! Oh! -Are you hurt? -No... You are drenched. I'm terribly sorry, but I leaned against that door, and-- You must take this wet coat off. Ch no, no, I'll-- If you don't take it off, you will catch pneumonia. I know--I'll make you a nice hot cup of tea. -Oh, no, please-- -A hot cup of tea -with a dash of brandy. -Ch. My mother used to say brandy was the best cure for anything--do sit down. No really, I couldn't put you to all this trouble. It is no trouble, no trouble at all. This is a paraffin heater, much cheaper than gas. Your predecessor, Mr. Prescott, had a paraffin heater. But he took it with him, of course. There's a shop not far from here that sells them. Next door to the launderette. Mr. Prescott loved my tea, net too strong for you? Just right, it's excellent. Now he's gone, but Mickey drops in now and then, he's-- well, he's my, my protégé. He sent me this valentine, don't you think it's pretty? Very. But why- why did you take that dreary little room? Well, when I arrived at the station I was fired, -and I- “Where are you from? What? No, no, no thank you. What? Oh, Devonshire. Devonshire, so many trees. I love trees. If you're ever looking for me, you'll find me sitting under a tree in the park. Yes, quite. I'm terribly sorry, but I have a dreadful memory for names, what'd you say your name was? Dr. Wallraven— uh, James Wallraven. -Oh, a doctor? -Well, academically speaking, I'm a doctor, but I suppose you should call me a schoolmaster. What do you teach? The boys at school call me "The Doc" or "The Professor." Oh, I teach literature, the classics. What are you doing in London? 1 often come up to London, I usually stay at my club, but, well, this time I thought I'd get away, be alone. Oh, its just a visit, then? Well, I'm here to work, research at the British Museum. How wonderful, the school must think a great deal of you to give you this kind of leave, do you enjoy teaching boys? Oh, I do think little boys are so sweet with their ears sticking out from under their haircuts. Professor, don't you find it very difficult for a teacher not to form attachments? Not to have favorites? Why do you say that? I don't have any favorites. I have no favorites! And I've no wish to form any attachment, you hear? Miss—Miss Fleming? I want to apologize for my behavior. I'm overtired, I've been working too hard. I hope you'll forgive me. Miss Fleming? Thank you. Thank you for the tea. I'm so sorry. Oh. Do you want some milk? I say, do you want some milk? The professor is out. Professor, you say? You don't take long to get acquainted, do you? Plenty of little tête-à-têtes. All I've got to talk to are my birds, and much good does that do me. Is the water hot, Mrs. Brent? No, Mr. Bhagwan's just had his bath. Give you a couple of hours and you're at it. First Prescott, now this one. One of these days I'll seal that bleeding connecting door up if it's the last thing I do! Why don't you get a locksmith? Dr. Norman, please. Oh, he's teaching? What time will he be free? Three o'clock, thank you very much. Miss Fleming, I've been looking for you all over. You told me I could always find you sitting under a tree. Huh, I always have my lunches here. If the weather permits. I want to apologize for last night. Oh, forget it-- please have a sandwich. -No, thanks. -Oh, please do. I'll only give them to the birds if you don't, really. There are too many for me. Ah, thank you. It's only cheese and tomato. Its excellent. Are you going back to the museum? Or are you taking the afternoon off? Well, I have to visit an old friend and colleague of mine. We started teaching together 30 years ago, at the same school, Tintern. And, well, I stayed on and he left in '56. To take over the ownership of a private school -in Knightsbridge. -Knightsbridge, well that's just a few minutes across the park. Yes, I thought I'd walk over and get there about 3:00. Its so nice for you to have friends here. Dr. Norman was a great scholar. He wrote to me about a year ago, begging me to join him. And, well, I may do that. Well, after I finish my work at the museum, of course. Oh, lovely. Perhaps we shall have lots of lunches here. Have another sandwich. No, thank you. I really must go. You've been very kind, thank you. But—but it's only— two o'clock. Let's see, let's see... “Why, James, what a surprise. -Henry. Oh, why on earth didn't you tell me you were coming? I thought it might surprise you, and it's a nice place you've got here. Oh yes, it's flourishing. So are you, by the look of things, you lock well, very well. Our work keeps us young, doesn't it? And busy. I believe I've got a staff meeting in five minutes. Well, I can wait. -James, I- -Henry, you remember that letter you wrote me? Well, that was a year ago. I'm afraid the post is filled, James. Well, I hardly thought that you'd be able to keep it open for me, though in fact, you said you would, but-- I was thinking of something temporary, that you might know of somewhere and be able to give the benefit of your good advice. Why, if there's anything I can do to help, of course I will, but... circumstances aren't exactly simple. Well, you know how small the scholastic world is. Narrow, even, and Tintern is very much in the limelight. What a great school, a great school. You always were a bit of a radical, and... then something like this happens... Something like what? Well, something-- I don't know how to, how to call it. How would you like to call it? I simply don't know. Oh, you must have some idea-- social disgrace, betrayal of trust, moral turpitude, hm? Well, it's something like that, isn't it? So you believe it. You hadn't even asked me what happened, and you of all people would believe it. It never even entered my mind. But mud sticks. -Yes. On innocent and guilty alike. Parents don't care how it got there, you know that. As long as it is there, they just grab their brats and run. I've got quite an investment here, James. I genuinely am sorry. You're sorry? Henry, I'm not asking for pity. I've invested 30 years of my life in that school. I turned down three headmasterships, you remember that, three. When I first went to Tintern it was nothing, third-rate, nothing. And something of me over those years began to rub off on the place-- dedication, personality, you can call it what you like. Such things are not measured in material terms. Oh, damn all you materialists! Damn all you idealists! What are you, a saint? Sounding off like Jesus Christ. Look, James, you asked for my advice, you can take it or leave it as you please. Drop all this nonsense. What are you trying to prove? That you're the young people's guide to utopia? Or better still, go for a job in the Commonwealth. With your qualifications, you could-- you can make a new life, new friends— I'm not running away. I'm going to fight this, step by step. I'm going to fight it, do you hear? Fine. And you, a man of peace? I am, I am! Until this moment that I could kill you. Come on, Princess, jump in, I'll take you to the theater. Oh, no, no, thank you. What you doing in this car? Well, I wanted you to see it. Come on, jump in. No, no thank you. -Oh, all right. Don't forget our date for my birthday tomorrow night. No, I won't. I There was a time not long ago & 2 When I said yes though I meant no 1 Only to please you I 4 And Pierre was pleased & I Remember the time I would believe J Anything you wanted me to & 1 Only to please you I 4 And Pierre was pleased & I Please please Pierre & I Why were you playing the game of love 7 2 To please Pierre & 3 Leading me on in the name of love 1 J You make the rules and you'll get by J I With some other girl willing to try & 1 Only to please you I J Then Pierre is pleased / J Oh maybe you found somebody new & 1 Somebody who's agreeing with you I 1 Only to please you I 4 And Pierre is pleased & I Please please Pierre & I Why were you playing the game of love 7 2 To please Pierre & 3 Leading me on in the name of love 1 I Please please Pierre & I Please please Pierre & I Please please Pierre & Thank you, Miss Fouchet. That's for us, if it's okay with you. Not a bad one to have 10 percent of, How right you are. Ha, okay? You were lousy. I'm kidding, marvelous. There... - didn't know we had a date. “Well, we didn't, but I thought I could take it on. -You've tried already. Well, no, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say really tried. Okay, okay, let's go. Does it work? -Yeah. Goodbye everybody, you were marvelous, I hope we do it again. -Get us the car? -Okay. -Back to the hotel. What, just like that? No museums, no art galleries, no nothing? -Not now, later. -All right then, later. -About 11:00 tonight. -Okay, 11. But something tells me I should be going to bed. -Oh yeah, later. -Later? Well, a bit later-- I'd like to talk just a little. About my song, just imagine a session like that. You, your orchestra, unbelievable what you could do for me. Yes, but the question is, what could you do for me? Wait. That too is unbelievable. Hey! -Yup, okay. Fine, bye-bye now. Oh, you're just a couple of days late. -You haven't clobbered it? Don't be crazy. Okay, so I'm crazy, now, are you buying? Gah, now that, is the thing. First I'll have to write to the old man, see if he'll play, and then wait for his check. So you write to me, spelling out the deal, then that way I have something -to show him. -Sc, how long? Uh, whatever it takes in the mail You'll wait. I might, but the client won't. If I get another taker, it'll have to go. -It's your ball. -Okay, so let me carry it. Johnny, can you lend me a tenner? Are you bloody marvelous, eh? In one breath we're talking a few hundred quid's worth, and in the next you're trying to touch me for a tenner. You'll get it back, but it's important. French bit? -Yes, and she's gonna record my song. -Oh, you hope. -I know. Mick, you're out of your depth. But you're a trier and I'm a gambler, tell you what. If-if you can con this French canary into recording your song, you can keep that down, besides, I'll make up -on the deal now. -Oh yeah, yeah, knowing you, that and plenty more.

I filed them on that pile of junk. Why don't you tidy up? “Why don't you go and-- -Oh, you screaming... Oh, what can we do for you? I'm looking for a new appointment. A headmastership. I teach literature, mainly. I'm a doctor of letters. Oh, a chair, sir. Now then, you're all right to sit down here, then. Make yourself comfortable. Oh, my dear sir, the world is so short of qualified teachers. Now, what kind of a school are you looking for? Well, somewhere in the country, preferably. Scotland or Wales. Ready for a semi-retirement? Yes, but of course, the emphasis nowadays is on young teachers. As you know, it's hard life. Where did you teach before, sir? - Tintern. -Ah, Tintern. And your name, sir? Wallraven. Wallraven? Yes, well I'll take your address--if anything does turn up, we'll be in touch with you, but... Good afternoon. Oh. -Oh. Oh, thank you. Three pounds, seventeen shillings, and six pence. You been raiding the gas meter again? Next. -Excuse me, if I should want to draw out 200 pounds, what would I have to do? Well, you'll have to fill in this form here. Should only take a week or so. Oh, thank you. Next. -Name? -Wallraven. R-AV-EN. Initial'? J. What kind of position do you want? I don't know. Qualifications. Qualifications! None. References? Do you have references? No. Will you wait? I'll get someone to talk to you. You didn't have to tell me, but thank you anyway. I had read about it, but I'd forgotten. And I think you should do the same. Artists are notoriously tolerant, thank God, 50 here at least, you should have nothing to worry about. Oh, Miss Hallum - Excuse me just a moment. I wonder if I can secure your services twice weekly, Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00-4:30. For the photographers, thank you. Oh, professor, this way, please. Wanda! Oh. I want Miss Fleming. She's gone out, dearie. Oh, damn. What are you doing in there? Playing the cello. Why, it's Miss Fleming. -Professor, hello. -Good afternoon. Have you had a nice day? It's been a very interesting day. -Oh, allow me, sorry. -Oh. Thank you. You know, I lived in a boarding house once that burned down because someone smoked in bed. Do you smoke in bed? A pipe, occasionally. Well, then there's not any chance that Mrs. Brent's house will burn down. What's the matter, Jean, is the competition too tough for you? French cow. She's just using him. Or he, her? Heehaw.

Thank you. Um, sorry to have disturbed you. Window, [ mean. Well, that's quite all right. Well, it's almost midnight. Another day gone forever. In fact, another year. Today was my birthday. Oh! Congratulations. Professor, would you have a glass of champagne with me? Well, that's very kind of you. Would you? -Oh! Thank you. Well, happy birthday. Thank you. 'Scuse me. Can I talk to you, Mickey? Um... Not a word from you all night. I know, I know, and I'm sorry. I've got something to tell you. I know, but I can't talk now, she is business. I can't talk now, it might spoil everything. Now, listen, where are you gonna be tomorrow? -Hm? -Tomorrow, where are you gonna be tomorrow? College of Art, modeling job. Okay, I'll call for you there. -I'll bet. -Now, come on. And keep quiet. All right, all right. Take me home, Johnny. Sure. I've, uh, written you. -You know what about. -Oh, yes, yes. -I'll call you. -Come on. Goodnight. I'm sorry, baby, I can't sing you to sleep tonight. -I've gotta visit my auntie. -Your auntie? Yes, she can't get to sleep {ill she knows I'm home safe. She's the mothering type. Thank you, Dick, let's do it again. -Sure, anytime, goodnight. -Ciao, baby. I used to play for Mr. Prescott. You play beautifully, Miss Fleming. Oh, not really. I've been told I have a nice touch but I shall never be a shining star. Well, why not? Though once, long ago, I dreamed of being the greatest woman cellist in the world. I've played ever since I was a little girl. My mother used to get me to do exercises every day so I wouldn't walk permanently as if I had a cello between my legs. -Have you a garden in Devon? -Yes. Yes, I'm a keen gardener. Oh, so am I, I adore flowers. Come and see my garden. "Daffodils that come before the swallow dares, and take the winds of March with beauty.” Shakespeare. Maybe one day, when you're back in Devon, you'll invite me to see your garden. I bring my cello and we'll all have tea under the trees. Devon's quite along way off, you know. Will you have another piece of cake? Oh, no, thank you. Are you married? No, no, I'm not married. I was almost married once. He and I had a tiny flat on the top floor of a Victorian house overlooking a square. We were so happy. Except for the strain of his waiting for a divorce. He gave me this cello over 20 years ago. It has a lovely tone, don't you think? What happened? Well, the war came and he had to go. He got his divorce. We went through the routine of a formal engagement. One evening, he invited me for a special dinner at the Café de Paris. He put the ring on my finger. I remember the band was playing "These Foolish Things." Someone was singing, "Oh, how the ghost of you clings.” And then it happened. Just one lousy bum. That's it, my birthday is over. Oh, it's such an ordeal growing older. Still, I'm lucky-- I'm healthy, and I have a nice new neighbor to talk to. Think of all the people in all the cities what? have no one to talk to. Quite. Tell me about those pictures. -Ch, they're-- -Oh, I'm not prying. You have a perfect right to tell me to mind my own business. But I couldn't help noticing one of them. How did you get mixed up with our wild and woolly youth? It doesn't suit you, you're so different. The only difference is in age. I feel as they do. They have a perfect right to say what they think about the way the world is. After all, it's their world as much as ours. Perhaps even more so. Yes, youth, sir, a dangerous and adventurous time. Remember, youth's the time to go flashing from one end of the world to the other. Wasn't that also Shakespeare? Robert Louis Stevenson. Oh, well, what was the rest? Well, roughly, to travel, to hear the bells of midnight, to run a mile to see a fire-- To see the sunrise in town and country? Yes, and never was tomorrow's sunrise less certain than it is today, and the young know this! But they're not going to be a doomed generation. They protest, and I march with them. They must be heard. Miss Fleming, you sit here and entertain me and you talk to me as if I were someone special. But you are! A teacher is someone special. Well, you are a teacher, aren't you? Oh, yes, yeah. Anyone who's willing to pass on what's taken great effort and many years to learn is special. You know, you're a very remarkable woman. -Oh, Mickey, hello! Hello. Professor, this is Mickey Hollister, my protégé I told you about. Mickey, this is Professor Wallraven. He teaches the classics. At the moment, he's doing special work at The British Museum. -Isn't that marvelous? -What's marvelous? Well, I must be going. Oh, Professor, please don't go! No, I really must be going, I have to get up early. The British Museum, you know? And goodnight, Miss Fleming, and thank you. -Goodnight, Professor! -Goodnight. It's so nice to have such an educated person next door. Well-bred, intelligent, and he has a garden in Devonshire. He seems so lost, I think he needs a friend. And you can't wait to be friendly, pamper him, do things for him. Prescott, I didn't mind. He was smaller than you and altogether different. But this man, I know his kind. He's after your generosity! Mickey. We had a date for my birthday! And when you didn't came, I asked the professor to have a glass of champagne with me. Friends, neighbors, come and have a glass of wine! Oh, no, champagne no less. Did you have Mr. Bhagwan down too? It's open house, it's always open house at Madame Wanda's. She will entertain you and help you solve your problems. And if she's in a really good mood, she'll cross your palm with silver! Have you lent him money? Oh, Mickey, please! Oh, Princess, Mickey is jealous! He wouldn't know what to do without his princess. He doesn't mean to be cruel. Princess, I wanted to be here. I wanted to bring you the largest bunch of roses. And a bottle of champagne! And a beautiful, beautiful present! But I had no money, not a penny. So I walked, just walked. Because I couldn't bring my princess anything for her birthday. I was outside when the clock struck 12:00. Finally, I couldn't stand it any longer. I just had to come up anyway, and there you were, enjoying yourself, not giving me a thought. But you need me, Wanda. You don't need anybody else. Not that professor, no one else! Mrs. Brent has two little birds. Perhaps I should have two little birds. Or a Pekingese, most older women seem to have a Pekingese to spoil. But I'm the only one you want to spoil. I'm the only one you want to buy presents for. Yes, your princess will buy a nice present for her prince. What, a little sports car? So Mickey and Wanda could drive to the country every Sunday and be silly, pick daisies and heather! We'd be the happiest people in England. I'm your friend. My friend. Oh, Mickey! You outta be ashamed of yourself! -Why? Why? You know it's my wash day! I came up at 10:00 to change your sheets and you were fast asleep! I can't do a thing in this house with everyone sleeping so late! Well, you'll have to keep your sheets another week. Well, that won't be anything new, will it? Hello? Hello, could one of you help me? Yes, ma'am. Tell me, is that the car that Mickey Hollister wants? -Oh, Mickey, yes indeed! - I want to buy it. You're going to surprise him, eh? -Yes. -Very good. Yes this is it, in wonderful condition. Three month guarantee. The previous owner looked after this car as if it was a baby. You his mom? No, no I'm not his mom, I'm his aunt. Oh, well, mother, aunt, girlfriend, what's it matter? It's the kind of car that'll turn any girl's head, eh? Would you like to come into the office? Yes, yes, thank you. Wanda? Princess? Hey, Mickey--Mickey what are you doing here, anyway? Yes I know, I know I'm strictly out of bounds, -but then so are you! What do you mean? Well, you're positively indecent like that! Except to me, of course. Oh, I could do with a cuppa. Thought you were on the Dubonnet kick now. Oh, that's good, that's very good. We'll all drink to Let's Be Jealous of Mickey Day. Your tea, Miss Hallum. Two lumps please, Doctor, Better than The British Museum, eh, Professor? Who's that? Oh, just a fellow, I'll tell you sometime. Come on now, let's get out of here. Have a good day at the museum, Professor? I'm just up to see Miss Fleming. She's going to be 50 disappointed. Princess, oh, Princess, I'm sorry I'm so late. But you don't know how I've been rushing. I had to go to Ealing 10 see my mother. Gout, and she drags me all that way! I wanted to come early, you know, I wanted to. Wanda? What? -You'll never guess. -Guess what? -That man. -You mean the professor? The professor! Professor of the classics, eh? Such reading and culture. He's nothing but a cleaner, a janitor, a tea boy. He's the guy who washes floors! He works at the art school where a friend of mine modeled this afternoon. -You are sure? -Yes, I'm sure. Oh, there must be an explanation, there just must be! Princess, forget that nasty man! He's just a liar! Did you miss me? Well, did you, Princess? Tell me you missed me! -Of course. - missed you too. I thought of you all the way to Ealing, and back. I would have phoned you, well there's Old Itchy Nose downstairs, Oh, Wanda, Wanda sweet, Oh you're wonderful! You been to that post office? You don't really care for me, I only amuse you. -Oh, no, Mickey! -Swear. Swear on your life that you care. I swear! Oh, I care about you so much, 50 very much! The terrible thing with me, I want something, I become obsessed. Its like that with everything, goodnight. Mickey! Mickey don't go! Oh, please don't go! Oh, please stay with me, I need you. Why are you so cold to me? -Cold? I'm not cold, just a little disappointed maybe. But not to worry, not to worry. Oh, Princess, if you have any brilliant ideas about how I could get my little white horse, please just shout and I'll come running. You're an old fool! Waiting for a pretty prince to throw you a crumb! You're fun, Wanda, You're really very fun! You're a pathetic old bag! Oh! What's that music? -Don't know. It sounds like someone practicing the cello. I should really go. “Why? My mother. Its a bit late to worry about your mother. She thinks I'm staying with a girlfriend. I told her I'd be back for lunch. Make it dinner. Bastards! -Mr. Hollister? Hey? What's that? -Oh, it's you. -Who were you expecting? Now come on, stir your stumps. I can't wait all the bleeding day for you. What's going on? Get her out, get her out of here! What do you think I'm running, a whorehouse? Yes, and not a very high-class one either. Well, let me tell you something, you can start packing for one! Oh, shut up, you old bag, you shouldn't have been poking around in the first place. No privacy. Why do you live in such a crummy joint? I'll tell you why, dearie, he suits it. -Get out of here! -Ow! You're mad, and you haven't heard the last of this! Mr. Bhagwan! Mr. Bhagwan! Glad that wasn't a knife. It might have cut her down to size. Oh, god--sorry, baby, I've gotta move. Not so fast, I've got something to tell you. You've had me for the last time. -Not now, Jeanie, later huh? “It's too late already. She's right what she says, anything suits you. Well, you try this for size: I'm pregnant. You are? As they say, it's your baby, honey. Next time, don't forget to take the pill. -...Sherman. -Davis. Philips. -Goss. Geller. Not working today, Professor? Come and see me later. No, don't! -You want to start a riot? -Push off, Dad! This is man's work. -If it's action they want-- -This is anarchy! Anarchy, yeah that's right, mate, now go home! 'Scuse me, please. (conversing in French) -Champagne, love? -Oh, thank you. Cheers. -I'm nervous. -Oh, came on, now. Excuse us, please. Claudia, you've done this 1,000 times before. I know, but it's so big. Just pretend it's The Olympia. They have their cues all right? Of course. Now come on, a great big smile for the press. Well, look who's here. Not now, Mickey. But she's leaving after the show. She told me. Well, what the hell do you expect me to do? Well, I expect you to help convince her. At least get her answer. -Okay, I'll see what I can do. -Oh, thank you. Yes, I leave to America this winter. Not before I have quite a few appearances to do. Claudia, look who's here. Mickey, darling. Yes, I'm leaving tonight. See what it's like? Sweetheart, you're on in two minutes. Okay, okay, see you after the show? -Sure. -Ciao, baby. Ciao. Richard, you know I have to... Now just you take it easy, get some sleep. I'll drop by tomorrow. Thank you. You're his neighbor, Miss Fleming? -That's right. -Try to keep him in bed. There's always the possibility of delayed shock. He's not young for this sort of thing. I'll keep my eye on him, thank you, Doctor. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. You should be more comfortable by now. -I owe you an explanation. -You don't owe me anything. I owe you an explanation. Read it I'm blind as a bat. Try these of mine. Oh, that does the job, thank you. If I ever lose mine, I'll knew where to come. Sure sign of anno domini, at least that's... what the medical textbooks say. You see that boy's picture? -That's him. -Yes, Geller. Of course, they kept his name out of it Such a nice-looking boy. Now, Professor, the doctor said you should have some rest. Oh, don't go, I haven't finished. Yes, Geller, he was a bright child, my best pupil. -So you did have a favorite? -You suspected that. Well, when I heard about your job-- Yes, I knew he'd tell you about that. I was so ashamed, I wanted to end it all. I nearly did. The doctor said you were hurt in a street brawl. Oh, that was later. Yes, Geller, he was the one boy among all others of whom I knew I would be proud to say I had a hand in his making. He had more than talent, he had that divine spark that I knew I could fan into genius. You see, we got through to each other. Oh, don't you have to go to the theater? Oh, it's too late now. Anyway, I'm playing with the Philharmonic next week. It's only rehearsal, I won't be missed. You're too modest. And you know you are beautiful. I'm an old bag! Now come on, finish your story. You must get some sleep. Well, it all began with the arrival of a new physics master, Stockdale. He seemed pleasant enough. But there was something about him, I couldn't quite put my finger on it. One day I was passing outside his study window and I heard Geller's voice and I saw him in there sitting side by side with Stockdale at the desk. And Stockdale looked up and saw me. Well, the next day, he invited me to dinner. And when his young wife was in the kitchen, he said in an odd sort of voice, "He's a charming child, that young John Geller, isn't he?" I didn't answer. And then he said, "Don't you agree?" As if we were in some sort of conspiracy together. I was stunned, furious. I warned him, but he just laughed and said I was to come off it. I even threatened him. It was a foolish thing to do. He too became angry and I left the house. It was a really foolish thing to do. You see, Geller was not only charming and brilliant, but he was sensitive. He was much the youngest of the boys in his form and he was ragged and bullied because of his gifts and his hard work, One day, I found him in my study looking for a book that I'd said I would lend him. His voice sounded strange and I noticed that he kept looking at the bookshelves and not in my direction, 50 I realized he was crying. Sc I put my am 'round his shoulders to steady him and he burst into sobs. At that moment, the headmaster walked in through the open door. -I was asked to resign. -Oh, no! When I refused, the head said that in that case, he'd have to take the matter to the board of governors. He added that the chairman of the board had told him of some rumor about me that he'd heard from one of the masters. He preferred to name no names, but of course I knew, Stockdale. I was asked to stay on until the end of term when my retirement would be announced. But some violating fool of a governor gave out to the local press that I had been relieved of my duties. I could sue. But, of course, I won't, I love the place. I suppose, Stockdale felt remorse or guilt, because he wrote me a letter begging me to come at once and to help him. That it was the last weekend of term and I had promised to lead a march at Plymouth. I thought he could wait. I was on my way back to the school to pick up some of my things when...it happened. He killed himself. How awful! His suicide note named me, and that was enough. I was dismissed. Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing. Well... You know, Professor, life is like a series of mountains all to be climbed. But the seventh and last, the cattle and the birds of heaven feed off the green grass, and the more they eat, the greener and better it grows. Some people are like that. They feed off each other and blossom. Perhaps... You can leave it for him in here. Please, if Mr. Hollister asks for me, give him that? - Certainly, ma'am. -Thank you. Okay? Here she comes. Hold on. -Brave. -Thank you. That takes care of him. You look beautiful too. -Miss Fouchet? -Yes-are you Mr. Hollister? Yes. -This is for you. -Thank you. Mickey, if you want to keep your reputation as a lover, don't try setting it to music. If you come to Paris sometime, I introduce you 10 my young sister. Claudia. The stage door's around here somewhere, I think. In fact, in fact, I'm sure of it. An! Oh, you look as if you've just lost a tenner! Very funny. Never mind, you can't win them all. No, you can't win them all. Come on, love, I'll take you home. Save yourself, I'm going with Johnny. Oh no, no you save yourself. -Yeah, you can depend on it. -Oh, yeah. Don't worry. -You ready, Johnny? -Good seeing you, mate. Yes, maybe, yeah. Oh listen, about that car, I'm bound to have news soon. I'm sure of that, sure. Oh! Why aren't you at the theater? None of your business. Got the sack? Now, what's that door doing open? What are you doing? I'm babysitting. Hmm, and something very peculiar is going on in my house. Don't think I don't know. You keep that boy, you pay him, think you're smashing, don't you? Men at your fingertips. Well, Mickey Hollister had a girl in his room last night. Had her, right under your feet. You get out, Sophia, you frustrated old cow! Wanda? Princess? Princess, it's me, it's Mickey, let me in. Princess, I know you're in, I can see the light. Please open the door. Wanda? Princess? Please, let... Princess? I've been bad, I know, really bad. Please...forgive me. Can you forgive me? Wanda, please. I don't want a car. I don't want anything. I only, only wanna be close to you. You're my sweet! Wanda? Wanda, Wanda! Princess, I have to talk to you! If you must follow me, take some of this stuff. Who's all this for, then? -We'll take a bus. -No, a taxi. Taxi! Wanda, I know I was cruel 10 you that night, and I regret it deeply. Can you forgive me? There is nothing to forgive. You're not angry anymore. Tonight, I'll have a bottle of champagne waiting for you! I don't want to see you anymore. Oh no, don't send me away! Please don't send me away! Ina day or so, you'll have your white horse and you can go off with your nice little girls and pick daisies and heather. What are you talking about? I bought that car for you. You do love me. You were only teasing. Wanda loves her Mickey. Professor, are you there? Just a minute. -Oh, I- -Are you feeling better now, -Professor? -Yes, thank you. Oh, that's good. Now, you let that be a lesson to you. We don't get mixed up in street fighting at our age, do we? Well, we all of us have to get involved sometime, Mrs. Brent. Yes, I see what you mean. Homey, isn't it? Of course I'd like to do the whole place over, but it takes money and, what with my repairs and rents and everything, well, I don't have a chance. Yes, it's a cruel world, Mrs. Brent. I am interested in the psychology of gesture. Why do you scratch your nose like that? Oh, I'm so glad you asked me that. My doctor says that when I get nervous or excited, that the blood tushes to the end. It itches and I scratch. That's physiology, but still. Oh, there's a lovely play on, Professor, tonight. And I'd love to give you a cup of tea, and there's such a good fire. Oh, well thank you but I have to meet someone in a few minutes. But thank you very much indeed. Oh, yes I suppose she'll be back. Well, I suppose music does have its charm. It certainly does. Why don't you take up the piano? No, thank you, Professor. I'll stick to television. -Goodnight, Professor. -Goodnight, Mrs. Brent. And don't forget to tum your light out. If I had the money my guests wasted in leaving lights on all 'round the house, I wouldn't have to take in lodgers. -Goodnight. -Goodnight! Nonsense, she's just a nosey parker. Hello. Thank you. Right, that's one for her. And two for the other bastard! Thank you for what you did to the room. Its lovely, but you shouldn't have. Why not? You're used to beauty. It was getting you down. You're very sensitive to other people. And you believed me. Of course I did. I'm a creature of faith. Faith is the only hope in this terrifying world. We all must have faith, Professor. I am deeply grateful, Miss Fleming. Call me Wanda. Then you must call me James. Al right. What's more, Professor... James, you must never stop fighting. You must never give in. Soon this nightmare will all be over for you. You'll be back in your lovely Devon, sitting in your garden under the trees. Could I come to the theater and hear you play? Oh, no! Why, would it disturb you? I don't know. Well, I can call for you after the performance and perhaps we can have some supper. Very well, then. Tomorrow night, the Windsor Theatre. If you come at 7:00, you'll catch the performance. Thank you very much. Depend on me, I'll be there. George, will you keep my cello for tonight? I'm going out for dinner. You are, Miss Fleming? Good, enjoy yourself. - Thank you, George, goodnight. -Goodnight, Miss Fleming.
