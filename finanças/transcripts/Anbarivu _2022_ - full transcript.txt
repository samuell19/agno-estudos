At a waterfall, the water that we find at the top flows below too. No matter what we do, there's only one Sun. Not sure how discrimination settles inside humans. We struggle and get a glass of water only if we aim for one pot of water. But I wanted to make a difference! Aandiyaapuram and Arasapuram are two neighboring villages. These two villages make one legislative constituency. Ironically, our folks were making the majority... but it's the folks of Arasapuram who call themselves superior... and decide the eligible candidate to contest for the MLA post. Precisely, Arasapuram's Muniyandi. If I had to make a difference and bring change... I understood that attaining power and position is the only solution to it. I realized that Muniyandi always lets his slaves contest and win the elections. So I toiled day and night for him. Everything was working out fine... until one man crawled into the scene. My friend, Prakasam. Instead of learning farming in the fields... he chose to go to college to study agriculture. He fell in love with Muniyandi's daughter, Lakshmi. They knew their relationship will be opposed. They decided to get married secretly. I know I was the one who compelled to get married. But I'm afraid my actions will disappoint my father. Rightfully, he should be the one giving me away at the wedding. I hope I'm not making a mistake. Let's not start our lives with guilt. Let's go! -Hey! -Dad, we didn't get married. -Bloody rascal. -Dad, hear me out. Had the hassle continued, my problem would've been solved. But a councilman interfered. Sir, please hear me out! -Muniyandi's best friend... -Muniyandi, please hear me out! No matter what you say I can't agree with it. Muniyandi, she returned because she respects and loves you. You'll be respected if you continue being a loving father In her eyes, you should always be righteous. Muniyandi laid a condition that he should stay with the in-laws after the marriage. But Prakasam refused to agree. Lakshmi convinced Prakasam to agree to it. The respect that I rightfully deserved after toiling day and night... was served on a platter to him. What are our children saying? Anbazhagan. Arivuazhagan. I was jealous. But I calmed myself because he's my friend. In the upcoming elections the people and party members... are expecting a change in the choice of candidate. Please think carefully and make the decision. Sir, Muniyandi sir has already mentioned that I'll be next in line. Hey... we can't cut through politics with a blunt knife. Get lost! You don't have any experience. -Sir, I can do it-- -It's okay. Forget about it. Maybe we can think about it after 5-10 years. Go, continue with your business. I have a suggestion, Muniyandi. Why don't you make your son-in-law the candidate? He's well-educated and has worked as a professor. Moreover, if we give a posting to our son-in-law... We have already broken all the barriers. You say, another fragment will make him one of us. I was outraged and wanted to kill Prakasam. But I thought about it with a calm mind. Pasupathy, the position of MLA calls for competency. That applies to the general public. But over here, servants, lawnmowers, drivers… whoever is a yes-man to Muniyandi is eligible to contest as MLA. Why do you think he's giving you this opportunity? He's trying to make a point without saying it out loud. Just think about it. Has he ever sat with you during a meal? He has ever respected you as a son-in-law. How long do you think you can bear this humiliation? Think about it. I'm leaving. Just because he wants I can't contest in the elections. He always makes his servants contest in elections. It's audacious of him to make such a remark on you. He has applied for a job in Mumbai. He has received the appointment letter too. Sire, he's going to take away your daughter and grandsons far from you. I wonder how you can bear this atrocity. My poison slowly started to work. My job is done here. I'll take my leave, sire. What's the compulsive need to go to North India for a job? Instead of enjoying the opulence and live luxuriously. Don't confuse my daughter with dreams, goals and self-respect. Dad, please hold on for a minute. Dear, we have more than enough out here than you could earn. My father has been paying you more than your ability. What do you know about my ability? Are you going to come with me? How can you put me in such a spot? She's living lavishly in this house. She and my grandsons don't have to taste hardship. -Dad! -You may go! Come along if you need me. -Hey, stop! -Hey, don't stop me. Dad! Stop right there! Why did you raise your hand on my father? Do you realize who is he? Dear, step back. I ought to... The fight became ugly and they were at each other's throat. If you're really that prideful get out of this house. -Get out of this house! -Muniyandi, don't say that. Muniyandi reacted just the way I wanted him to. -Do you still want to live here? -I'm not sure about it. But preferably, I'll stay at my father's house. Give me my son. Prakasam, did something that I never planned. Obviously, I used it to my advantage. Hey, why did you bring your son along? As her father didn't raise her well, she couldn't understand my plight and is stubborn. I’m going to show Muniyandi how to raise a child. -Let's go. -Okay, hop on! I dropped him halfway... and convinced him to escape. After that, I arrived at Muniyandi's house and stole money and jewels. I informed JP and Muniyandi... that Prakasam is escaping after stealing money and jewels. I also informed Praksam's folks. Jayaprakasam in his haste... Son, what's wrong with you. Please hear me out... -Uncle, I don't want to go back. -Please hear me out. This is our family matter. Please don't interfere. Uncle, please watch out. Muniyandi, brought his men along... and hacked down Prakasam's relatives. -Dad! -Prakasam, don't step out. Get back inside. Don't go back on your goals. At least one of us must emerge successful from our clan. -How can I leave in this situation? -They won't let you live in peace. For God sake get back inside. Get inside! Driver, come on keep moving. Go! Their family feud turned into a feud between two villages. All along, you were the culprit. Why did you do it? Don't get angry, Jayaprakasam! The name "Prakasam" has become a hurdle to me. You called me a blunt knife, right? Now see how it'll slit your throat! Sire! Sire, someone killed JP, sir. Muniyandi, who lost his respect and name, asked Lakshmi to vow to live only with him along with her first born. Unaware that I was the reason for getting two villages into a feud... Muniyandi, sire, and my village folks started to trust me blindly. After that, I, Pasupathy, who used to be a servant... I, Pasupathy... 24 YEARS LATER Hello! Hello! It's the harvesting festival! Our Muniyandi sire's grandson... Lakshmi ma'am's son And our beloved friend. In the honor of our Dear Anbu's birthday... the grand event of Jallikattu is about to begin. A big hand everyone! Listen everyone you'll get only 2 minutes with the bull. Aandiyaapuram folks shouldn't tame Arasapuram's bull. If you still do, then it'll end up in a mess. Listen to this, it's important. Don't worry if you get hurt in the arena. We have a medical camp nearby; you'll be given free treatment. I had gone to a lot of doctors... but I was never given proper treatment. Really, grandpa? -Subbaiah... -I'll cure you. Now that you've come to my daughter... be rest assured you'll be cured in no time. Okay, sir. -Hello, sir. -Hello. Hello. Please sit down. Dad, now you come. Let me run a small check-up on you. Dear, I'm always with you. -No disease is going to infect me. -Dad, you're smart. Why don't you run a check-up on your to-be? I'm a doctor for humans not buffaloes. -Dear, stop it. -Are you calling me a buffalo? Hey, don't be a coward and hold the tail. I dare you to hold its hump. The bull is breaking every bone it comes in contact with. I'm not sure which family may benefit from this Jallikattu... but our Puttur ortho Jayaraman's family will reap the benefits. Brother, throw that to him. Come on, take it. Since Anbu's birthday fell on Pongal festival... his grandfather turned Pongal festival into his birthday celebration. Bloody crooks! Let alone these banners! Singaram, our time will come. -We'll handle them. -I don't think so. Let's go! Listen, now the competition is getting fierce. Now enters the mighty bull, Marudhu... that symbolizes the grit of Sire, Muniyandi and Anbu. Whoever dares to tame Marudhu that remains untamed since 10 years... will be rewarded with a Jeep. Marudhu! Marudhu! No one can even touch him. Fearing defeat, they've allowed only their village folks to compete. Forget it, buddy. Hey, it's wrong only if we touch it. -We can poke it though! -What are you saying? I sent one of our men in the arena with a needle in his hand. Hey, Marudhu, tear them apart! Marudhu has won the fight for 10 times in a row. We're trying to reward the winner every year... but no one has emerged a winner. There's no one in the district of Madurai to tame Marudhu. As no one could tame, Marudhu... with the permission of Sire, the prize will go to the organizers. Hey, where's Anbu. Someone bring him over here. Handler, pace down the bull. Go and bring, Anbu. -It might tear their stomachs. -Where is Anbu? Hey, everyone run! Hey, make way. Come on, step aside. Oh, no, Anbu has begun his atrocity! Oh, God, he'll start again. I'll convince him and bring him home. You leave now. -I am worried, dad. -Dear, you carry on. -Dear, you please leave. -I hope the fight doesn't get serious. -Drive away. -Dad, please be careful.

If you dance to their tunes I won't even feed you water. Why are you chiding at Marudhu? She's indirectly chiding at you guys. You were supposed to compromise and bring him back... instead you indulged in the fight too. Obviously, I can't chide at you. Dear, I did go there to compromise. But a 6ft man came with 7 ft cane to attack Anbu. How do I let anyone hurt my grandson? So, I slapped him hard! Similarly, a 7ft man came with 8ft cane to attack grandpa. How can I let anyone hurt my grandpa? -I too whacked him! -That's right, aunty. -A 12ft man-- -Shush! After that? He came to attack but left right away. Your grandpa has spoiled you alot... that's why you're out of control. Dad, he never pays heed to my words. I'm worried by the day. Aunty, why do you have to fear, when I'm with him? That's my fear exactly! Dear, please don't worry about him. Until this Muniyandi is alive, no one in this district can dare lay a finger on him. Similarly, until this Anbu is alive... no one in this district can dare lay a finger on my grandpa. Come on guys shut up! Aunty is already very scared. Please make them understand. Aunty, don't fear anymore. Not just this district even in other no one can dare touch them. -I am going to whack you, -Dude, help me. Mom, please don't beat him. -I'll whack you! -Mom, it hurts. -Mom, I'm very hungry. -I'm going to whack you too. -Get lost! -My body hurts. I didn't do anything. It was grandpa and Dheena who instigated me. Hey, come on, if not we'll have to remain hungry. Son, why do you want to go to Arasapuram in a large group? That old man and grandson will still continue to attack us… and you expect me to sit ducks! Listen, I know how I handle this matter perfectly Be a bit patient. Hurry up. Let's leave before he notices. Where are you folks headed to? Where's the entire family headed? -We're headed to the temple? -Temple? It's Tuesday, which temple is open? Stars are favoring Aries today. If we light lamps at deity Amman's temple it does good to the people of that star. Aries? Who is Aries in our house? Prakasam uncle is Aries... Did you just call him your uncle? I've been slogging for this family... but the prayers are being offered to a runaway. Get back inside. Let's do this once for brother. Hey, can't you people hear me? Get back inside! Enough with the brother love. -He's not even worth it. -We should've taken the back exit. Hey, be careful it's a new Jeep. Don't damage the vehicle. I was saying... you threw strong punches during the Jallikattu fight. I was wondering how you did it. I picture the enemy as the runaway-Prakasam. It fuels my anger giving me immense power. Are you talking about your father? Even as a joke... don't call him my father. Just the thought of him makes me angry. Just picturing him brings carnage. Imagine if you get hold of him. I'll crush him. I'll crush him! I thought everything will be smooth on Arivu's birthday. Phew! I thought I could relax a bit on Arivu's birthday... but it looks impossible. Hey, listen! -What are you doing? -Shall we start? -Go! Go! -Yeah, let's begin. What's the secret of your success? -It's simple. -Calm down! Calm down! There's no secret for success. It's the result of ones' determination after failures. What's the most precious thing you value and lost in your life? The most precious thing I lost in my life is my wife. And now my whole life is my son... Arivu! -Happy Birthday, son! -Happy Birthday, Arivu. ♪ Get up! Gotta rise early buddy ♪ ♪ Ready!

Hey, come on. -Today, I'm going to crush them. -Grandpa, let's go. -It'll prick them if we wear shades. -I'll keep it safe with me. Hey, did you get this at the thrift market? Did it cost a dime a dozen? How do I look? I visit Assembly often, so I bought it. Oh, how do you carry yourself? Did you see that? The Chennai heat strikes straight on the face. -Oh, really! -Hello, Sire. Sire, he's newly appointed Collector. He summons meetings for no reason. Not sure what he will talk about. Fine, let's go and check what he has to say. Let's go, brother. -Son? -What is it? I heard you you created a carnage at the Jallikattu. Obviously! It's Singaram who instigated the men and lead them into a fight. -I tried making him understand. -Forget about it. Why don't we end him for good? Brother, hope he doesn't turn into a big shot with such ideas. I'm holding back myself because grandpa asked me not to. If not by now I would've ended his life. -Come on, let's go. Grandpa is waiting. -Brother, let's go. -Singaram has arrived. -They've come too. Welcome Shanmugam, brother. -How are you? -I'm doing well. I see that it doesn't bother you even if you're summoned all the time. And just nod your head like a yes-man and leave. Go ahead. In the name of Council, they'll make you stand... and make them sit and talk about law. Eventually you people keep nodding your head. What else would you do? Let's go! Sir, you keep adding fuel every chance you get. The days are gone when burning down huts were part of the political game. The trend is to burn bridges. You gotta keep yourself updated! I've summoned you all to discuss about an important matter. Sir, I believe this is not a council. You summoned us to discuss right? Get us all chairs too. We'll sit down and discuss. Hey, Singaram, respect is earned. If you beg for some respect, it's called something else... Hey, Anbu, don't disrespect. -Don't you dare! -Everyone calm down. Collector, sir, poor folks have weak knees... why don't you get them a couple of chairs to sit? -Hey, Anbu! -Singaram, calm down. He's trying to instigate you. Calm down. Collector, sir, please come straight to the point. The old man is too prideful, I say. Ten years ago, I read about this village and the chariot it holds. I still remember how the officers were stunned... to know that such a chariot exists in Tamil Nadu. But the bitter fact is that the chariot is stranded in the village for 15 years. Back in the day, they used to build huge chariots... and employ 1000s of them to pull it Why do you think they bring it back where did it all start? Maybe they were jobless. No, no. It was because everyone was happy. It was a concept invented to keep the folks united. So, I've decided to organize the Chariot-Carnival this year. If that's what you wanted you could come straight to me. The men of Arasapuram are enough to pull the chariot. But my ancestors built this Chariot. Now listen, this chariot belongs exclusively to Arasapuram. The outsiders have no share in it. Sir, chariot is a common property. It belongs to both the villages. Please make the old man understand. Collector, sir, the car belongs to the person who paid for it. It doesn't make sense if the mechanic claims the ownership. Collector, sir, I can understand your plight. But the plight of villages states something else. They keep fighting and there's a murder every week. There can be legal problems. Sir, if this was limited to just the villages... I can pass an order and bring the chariot back to the temple. But this is your family feud! That's why I'm discussing it with both the families. They're not family! Do you even know? It's been 24 years since we cut ties. To hell with the family! Listen, you and your Govt. do as you please. The chariot belongs only to us. Madasamy, this is my grandfather's picture be careful. -Be careful. -Okay, ma'am. Careful! Please be careful. Clean all the pictures and lock it up inside the house. And throw away the respect and the name they earned for their family. Hey, why are you yelling at your mother? You hold me back and mother doesn't know what's happening in the village. Look, the folks worship grandfather as a deity. Because of your mistakes from the past... his name is getting tarnished and my peace is getting disturbed. Hey, shut up! Mother, you left a humiliating scar that cannot be healed. But you're living a fun life. -Grandpa? -I'll break your jaw, damn it! Dad... I've never questioned her. Who are you to question her? Get lost! Oh, now I am a stranger, is it? The love for your daughter is your worst enemy. You raised your hand on me for your daughter. Get lost, grandpa. Get lost! -Buddy! -Don't stop me. Grandpa, I agree that he spoke ill about her. But he spoke out of anger 'cause someone humiliated you in public. And you slapped him. Anbu, stop right there. He is right about me. I'm guilty here instead you're beating him. Lakshmi, you're the Queen of this village. You should never be in tears. That runaway-crook is to be blamed. You and your son are not responsible for his act. Anbu speaks his heart when he's angry. But he doesn't take it to the heart. He's just like me. Listen, until this Muniyandi is alive, you shouldn't shed tears. Wipe your tears. I said, wipe your tears! -Hi, dad. -Hi, dear. Thanks for being an awesome dad, once again. Just 'cause I requested you took away the bodyguards... and got me and admission at the college I liked to study. Thanks for giving me the freedom and trusting me. Thanks a lot for trusting me. Anything for you. Take care. Bye, dad. I'll make you super proud. Wow, a lot of Indians. Hey, are you from India? I love India. -"Motherland, I salute you!" -To all the freshers... let me make one thing very clear! -Hey, wassup! -I'm everything out here. -You guys play by my rules. -Oh, ragging! Excuse me, bro! -Hey, what are you doing here? -Hey, you! Hello, I should be asking you that question. I thought you were going to Oxford... what are you doing at this normal college? -You see-- -Hey! -Who the hell are you? -I'm sorry. My bad! Forgot to introduce myself. My name is, Arivu. I'm here to do a 6-month-course on Asian vegetation. And you are? Hey-hey! Peg yourself to be white-man? End this fake show-off. Bloody fresh-off-the-boat! Bro, all of us eventually arrived by boat or flight to this country. Are you a white-man? Maybe your ancestors... someone or the other must've come here looking for a job. "All places in the universe are ours." So, I am here to make friends! -Let's be friends. -Don't call me your friend. No violence! What the hell is happening here? Sir! You're caught brother. -I am warning you. -I told you. Everybody go back to your classes. I am warning you, again. Go! Brother, do not rag, that's bad. -You're marked! -Uh-oh! -Sir, he-- -It's alright. Thank you, sir. How did he arrive right on time to save me? -Something is wrong... -Hey, you okay? Hi, Mr. Arivu. Thank you very much for saving us from his evil clutches. I-I actually-- He's been in the same position for a while. The professor came in at right time. It's okay you don't have to mention it. -What is your name? -Blacky! How do you understand, Tamil? Tamil-- I caught you bloody bodyguards! Gave me an illusion of freedom... and sent bodyguards along with me to the college. I'll handle him later. Boss! Boss, please boss. Please, boss! -For God's sake don't call you father. -Hey! -You speak fluent Tamil, damn it! -I'll lose my job. Boss, my father is your father's bodyguard. So...? I was trained since childhood to be your bodyguard. -Please forgive him. -Today is my 1st day on the job. Please boss. Please! Okay, okay. I won't call my father. -But let's make a deal. -Deal? If you don't want me to call my dad about the incident... you too shall not report any incident to my father. -What? -Deal? -Blacky, you might lose the job. -Okay, boss! Okay, boss! -Hey, don't yell, damn it! -Okay, boss. -I just need to talk to him. -Hey, Singaram! If you wish to meet, sir. Either come to the office or his house. -This is not the right way. -He's from my village... ...I'll meet him as I please. Just shut up! Hey, shut up. He's like family. What is it, Singaram? You must've noticed at the collector's office. The old man and grandson won't let us raise our heads How long do we stay oppressed? There are boys who look up to me... and would do anything for me. The village folks believe that I'll have their backs no matter what. So, I wanted to do something remarkable for them. How much do you need, Singaram? Here you go! Brother... I don't need money. Instead, give me a posting! If you could recommend and get me a posting in your party. I'll do the needful for my boys. Also, I'll settle down in life. Give me that. What do I tell them when I'll recommend your name? They'll block the opportunity for one of their own You speak more but behave immaturely by hurting the bull. Anbu is not blessed with long life. I'm waiting for the right time. Murdering him won't fetch you a posting right away. Murder is the new breaking news. It has become an ordinary matter. Here, controversy carries more weight than the content. Destroy something that's more valuable to them. They were very proud of their bull... So, I did it! Do you really think the bull is their pride? You may have stuck your neck up. Yet you fail to notice the obvious. Why? They build a stage in front of the chariot... stand tall speaking on it oppressing our voice. You must've noticed how they get outraged at the mention of the chariot. Brother, I'll take 2 barrels of petrol from Sekar's petrol pump... and burn down that chariot. Do you think you can pull it off? Brother, I can pull it off. It'll be great if you could. Also, don't fear if you get arrested. The entire village will respect you. I will offer you a post at my party. Brother, it'll be great if you offer me a high position in the party. I'll offer you my post. Don't just settle for a small posting. Brother, please do the best you can. I'll come to you once I'm done. Then you'll know my worth. Sir, just think about it... people who have burned down things have achieved big in history. He can't do squat! Hey, let's go to Arasapuram. Right! Hello, uncle, how are you? Little brats, how are you? Come on, go head and play. I'll join you guys soon. -Hello, Mr. Groom! -Welcome! Aunty, mom sent this for you. So, Mr. Groom, how's it going? Sister, how are you? Dude, are you serving meat at the feast? I see people who aren't supposed to be here? He must've printed the cards in excess, just ignore, dude. Yeah, he's right! When they've invited jobless creatures like you... I'm a Doctor, why wouldn't they invite me? Hey, woman! You'd have patients only if we send them to you. He's talking nonsense!

They were way too proud of this chariot. This incident will suppress Arasapuram's arrogance! -Take out the barrels. -Okay, brother. Singaram... I didn't care much because you're young and over-enthusiastic. Creating a rumpus, is it? Singaram, this marks your end! Ending you is the right thing to do. The rumpus begins! -Hey, run! -Come on everyone run! Hey, let go of my veshti. Singaram! Sir, let's stop the fight and gather a council. Venkat, I'm like a referee. I pull them apart so that they'll fight harder. Hey, now is the right time. Hey! Bloody, you're dead meat! -Stop fighting. -Anbu! Anbu, let go! -Anbu, let go. -Let go of me. Anbu, let go. Brother, he was about to burn down the chariot-- -I said calm down. -Brother, let go! Hey! Let go. Dheena, the weapons are in the boot. Bring them to me. -Hey, I dare you. -Bring me the weapons. I'm going to kill him. Come on, damn it. I'm not going to spare you. Hey, Anbu. Anbu! -I'll kill you damn it. -Brother, let go. I have to kill him. I dare you to kill me. Sire, it's not a big issue. Hey, Anbu... Grandpa, they were going to burn down the chariot. Sire, the law will perform its duty. Please don't get outraged. Sire! For hundreds of years this chariot has been the pride of our legacy. He has tried to burn it down purely out of envy. Stupid fellow. How can I not get angry? Limit your politics to the people who voted for you. I'm the kingmaker. Don't you dare mess with me? To hell with your law. Hey, enough talking. Tie that rascal to the pillar. -Hey! -Brother please hold on. I agree that what he did was wrong. Tell me what's the penalty? I'll make the payment. Oh, is it? Fine, I'll hack him down and pay the penalty. -Anbu, please calm down. -Hey, take your hands off him. -Sire, please stop him. -I will beat him. Anbu, take your hands off him. -What the hell? -Anbu, calm down! You don't know what's happening out here. -You shut up! -Anbu! Don't raise your voice to your mother. What they did is completely wrong. But killing them is not justice. It will only disturb the peace of both the villages. Hand over these men to the police... I feel going by the book is the right thing to do. What do you say, dad? -DSP? -Yes, sire. Arrest these men. The entire village will file a complaint against them. -Complaint? -Hey, let's go! -Let's leave. -Hey, keep moving. Uncle, hire a lawyer to bail us out. Constable, arrest them all and take them to the jeep. Don't cry. They have to get arrested for the crime they've committed. He'll be back soon. The other day I had such a great time. If you think about it. It's really good. Sorry to interrupt you guys. You shouldn't have dared to speak against me. Guys, let's find out who the real, Arivu is. -What? -Boss, what's happening? See what comes up when I put your picture in Google search. Look at the real, Arivu. -Hey? -Bloody joker! You questioned my ethnicity right? I take it you're a country brute! Why are you laughing? -Not even boats. It's bullock carts. -Stop it guys! Silly villager! Look at yourself man. Shut up, okay! Arivu! Arivu! You walk cow for living? Jeff, what the hell? What's wrong with you? -What a joke! -Arivu. When he sees it he'll be very happy. -Hi! -He came. He came! Arivu, welcome, welcome, welcome. Welcome! I have a surprise for you. AP Limited Edition watch. That's right, Arivu. After Brunei Sulthan and Mark Zuckerberg, my Arivu will own this watch. Yes! You always buy me the rarest things in the world. But you hid the truth that everyone cherishes in their lives. Dad, where's my mother? Arivu... I don't like seeing your face, dad. It's one thing to lie. But saying my mother is dead is extreme. Dad, I wish not to disturb your happiness but... until today I never expressed my feeling about missing my mother. You kept my mother and brother hidden from me. Arivu! He kept the truth under wraps fearing he might lose you. Except for this small mistake-- Small mistake? Isn't this enough? You just knew and couldn't take the truth. Just imagine how he must've bear the truth all these years? Why don't you think about it? Please, someone understand, Prakasam! To date no victory has given me happiness. The reason being no one ever has understood me. You did get me. But I couldn't stay true to you. Your grandfather is the sole reason for all this mess. If you're really that prideful get out of this house. Despite many efforts... Lakshmi never understood me. That's when I realized that every person based on their limits... judge other people. No matter how big you achieve it won't be enough for them. If you see, technology has advanced... but your mother or brother never tried to contact you. Can you tell me why? Because to your mother only her father matters the most. But to your grandfather, his ego and foolish principles are first. I've achieved big time. But to my native and my children... I've never done anything in return. I won't expect you to understand this right away. The moment when my happiness froze. Just like how you pretended to be happy earlier... I too pretended to be happy. The pain that's inflicted when true love is disrespected... I know well how deep it runs. I wished that you shouldn't endure it. But actually... I feel very relaxed. It's like my stress has gone down. After 24 years, I'll sleep peacefully tonight. Goodnight, son! In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen! Aunty! I was praying so that you shouldn't get this idea... but you're already on it. Aunty, we live in an age where people move on soon after the break-up. But my father has been in love with my mother for 24 years. He must've loved her dearly. I am the labor of their love. It's safe to let things go that can't be changed. I totally get it, aunty. My mother is angry with her husband. Reasons could be Innumerable. But why is she angry with me? I mistook my father for just an hour. But once I learn the rightness on his side... I feel guilty that I made a mistake. For 24 years my mother, brother and grandfather has misunderstood him. It'll be great if they understood him right. I've never asked anything from my father. But he looks for them and buys me everything. You heard what my father desires. His native, family... I will definitely make it happen for him. For dad... here, a picture clicked like this for him to keep in his wallet. But with the entire family. I have to go! -Aunty... -What is it, Arivu? You raised me since childhood... you may feel that I'm running off once I heard that my mother is alive. Once you started talking, you called me aunty. No one taught you to call me aunty. You must've realized it yourself. You're always my Prince. God bless you. "I'll neither go away from you nor will let you down." Singaram, the old man and Anbu... made a strong case against you so that you don't get bail. It was Pasupathy, sir, who spoke to the Judge and made bail for you. Brother, inform the same Judge. There's nothing in poking the bull or burning down the chariot. I'm going to kill the old man and Anbu. "Motherland, I salute you!" Hi! He looks like Anbu! Hey, Anbu! Anbu? -No Wi-Fi, how do I connect? -I've been calling you. Is this your new look for the rumpus? I take it you're carrying sickles inside your backpack. Fine, tell me where are you going? No. 72... Lakshmi Illam, Pechi Amman Street Arasapuram, Madurai. Dude, you should've said you're heading home. Okay, where is your convoy? -Where's your Jeep? -Jeep? Why are you constantly staring at your phone? Uber! Cab, taxi! Dude, you should've said you don't have a ride. Crack, why would he call me, Anbu? If I drop Anbu home I can score brownie points from Sire. After that, I'll become the Dean of the hospital. Yes! Sir, no, no, please let me go. Anbu, actually I'm a good doctor. I've treated most of the men you beat up. You should mention this to your grandfather when he's in a good mood. Tell him that Nimmadhi is a very good doctor. Hey! Anbu, your men are already in a fight before you got here. Oh, my God! If that's Anbu fighting over there... Hey, who are you? Hi, Doc, I'm Arivu, from Canada. So, that's Anbu. My brother. Brother? Hey, are you here to reunite your family? Get down. I said, get down, damn it. -Why doc? -Why? If Anbu knew I brought you here. Not only you but he'll hack me down too. -Trust me, I'll handle him. -I'll be dead meat by then. -Hey! -Doc? Oh, no, Anbu is hurt! -Let me call, Sire. -Brother! Hey, hear me out, please don't go out there. Brother! Brother! Anbu! Brother. Anbu! Brother. Brother, please get up. -Brother... Brother... -Hey! I am Arivu, brother. Brother! You! Bloody, I ought to... -What happened to, Anbu? -Sire, sire, sire! Please don't make noise. Anbu is fine at the moment. His tire burst, the vehicle lost control and rammed into a tree. Due to which he got slightly hurt on the back of his head. I think Singaram has done this fearing we might file a case against him. Dad, let go now. Doctor, how is Anbu doing now? Ma'am, I'll treat him well and discharge in 7 days. Seven days more? Grandpa, I wasn't there my friend got harmed. I'll stay back and look after him. You guys leave. -Nimmadhi... -Sire? Anbu will become normal now. Sire, please trust me... and leave without any worries. I'll bring Anbu home once he's totally recovered. Lakshmi, they'll take care of him. Let's go. Doctor, please spare no expense. Please take good care of Anbu. You don't have to worry at all. -Brother, please leave. -Let's go, dear. -Doctor said Anbu has a head injury. -Are you serious? I'm really worried to know what happened to Anbu. Let's go. My ill fate is that I have to treat him. Hey, Anbu! You can't do that. You can't touch me without my permission. How's he speaking in English? -Doc! -Kayal, dear, please listen. Please don't tell anyone about it. What's happening out here? Tell me? What are they talking about? Oh, no! -Nurse! -Yes, doctor. Kayal and I will take care of this patient. Okay. Make sure no one get inside the room. Hey, how dare you not allow me? Damn it! Arivu, it's not an easy task to enter that house. It's not easy to fool your mother and your grandfather. Fair enough. But I have a plan. I can't enter the house as Arivu. That's logic. But I can enter as Anbu. You're talking as if it's a film. Dude, you're an NRI. But he's an authentic Madurai folk! Madurai folks have a grit that can't be matched. If we twirl our veshti it'll create riots. And if we twirl our mustache, it will rain rumpus. No matter which corner of the world it is... you can easily spot a Madurai folk. Because of the unique body language. So, are you leaving? Phew! I'm going to change. I am going to change into authentic Madurai folk. What? Train me. I'll learn. That unique body language. Nimmadhi, you're doomed! Tie it like how he's doing it in the video. Oh, God! I'll teach you the walk of Madurai folks. Sire, I'll get him cured and send him home myself. -Hey, what is this? -Just friendship, doctor. Mom! So, it's them who kidnapped me. How dare you kidnapped, Anbu? Grandpa, this is Anbu calling. Prakasam and his son have kidnapped me. Grandpa, it's very cold out here. If I am right they must've brought me uphill to Kodaikanal. Listen... I diverted all the calls made to India on my phone. -India? -Welcome, Anbu! Are you confused about where you are? Don't think hard. You're in Canada. As you're twins, Arivu, used his passport to send you here. Hey, you'll be the first father in the entire world to kidnap his own son. Grandpa, was right about you. You're a thief! Not bad, she did raise you saying that I'm your father. Good! You'll find all the comfort in this house. Until Arivu returns... Hey... I mean your brother Arivu returns you will have to stay here. You can't go anywhere from here. John. Sir, please, sir. Hey, let go! -Hey! -Boss? -Hey! -Guys, wait, wait, wait! How dare you lay hands on me? Damn it, you kidnapped me when I was unconscious. That doesn't make you brave. How dare you kidnap, me? Prakasam, you didn't realize that you've invited trouble into your house. I have a habit. If someone dare to mess with me... I'll make sure that he regrets until I'm done with him. I have made a decision. You said you'll make me stay here? Hey, I'll stay right here in this house. You betrayed my grandpa, mother and my family. I will stay right over here until I get all the answers. Prakasam, hereafter, the reign of Anbu will... start! Goodnight, son! See you tomorrow. You said you'll discharge him but have been showing your teeth. Is there a problem, doctor? There's no problem, sire. But there's a compression in Anbu's brain. Compressor? Hey, put it in layman terms. Sire, has Anbu ever hugged you? -No he has never done it. -But now he'll hug you. The love and affection from his subconscious has taken over. He'll hug with love calling you, grandpa! Hey, say that he's become affectionate. But you're stating it as a disease. Anbu is from Madurai right? Madurai folks are very affectionate. -That's what I meant. -I got worried. -Anbu. -Grandpa! -Grandson. -Grandpa! -How are you? -Anbu, how are you? -I hope you're well. -Everything is fine, grandpa. Anbu, that's Dheena. -Anbu. -Buddy! I never knew an accident will make you very affectionate. Where's mom? Grandpa, where's mom? Mom is at home offering prayers as you're returning home. Then let's go home. Come on, hurry up! Buddy, you've turned extremely affectionate. ♪ You stand like a golden statue Oh, my mother! ♪ ♪ How could you forget me?

I feel like telling her that I am Arivu. -Arivu... -I won't tell her, dad. Fine, if someone sees me I'll get in trouble. I'll call you back later. Take care of Anbu. No matter what he's my brother. I'll make sure your brother doesn't even shed a tear. Fine, I'll safely bring back your wife to you. -Chill, dad. -Love you, dear. Oh, no! Oh my God! Hey! Go away! Thank God! What do you want man? What's your problem? Huh? Go! Go! Go, go! Marudhu! Mom, I thought of taking a bath in the well. But there's no water in it. -Come with me. -Mom, where? Mom! Mom, where are you taking me? Arivu, you leave from here. Uh-oh! I got exposed so soon. This is the best you could react, mom? I've returned after so many years... I expected you to ask me how am I doing? But you're chasing me away. I saw how you're doing. But I wish you to stay alive. Mom, I'm prepared to face everything. -First, tell me, where's Anbu? -Oh, God! Even now you care only about Anbu. He's safe and sound with dad. After so many years I came yearning to meet you. When I'm showered with affection suddenly after 25 years... what do you expect of me? You're right, mom. It's been 25 years. For the past 25 years, I never knew you were alive. But you always knew I existed. Why didn't you come looking for me? You fought with your husband. Why were you angry with me? What was my fault? You had Anbu with you. So, you never missed me. But I had no one out there. I really missed you every day, mom. People said you'd love me only if I pretend to be Anbu. So, I pretended. That's it! Am I not your son too? Oh, God, you're killing me, Arivu. I've cried for many days. Looking at your empty cradle. You're my son too dear. That means you like me, right? -Mom? -Yes! Come to me mom. Please, mom. -Come on, mom! -Arivu! Mom, let's go. You, me, dad and Anbu. We'll be a happy family together here. Let's go. Please say something. -What is it, mom? -Bring Anbu over here. You, me, Anbu and grandpa. We'll stay right here as a happy family. Mom, what are you saying? Don't you feel sorry for dad? Then what about my father? Mom? Your grandpa has done a lot for me. More than what your father did. To be honest, your grandpa, held me together... but your father never did. This is my house. I will not leave my father behind and go anywhere. Okay, mom. Done, mom. -Welcome, ma'am. -Welcome, Anbu! -Greetings to all. -Hello. Hello. Arivu, remove your footwear. -Mom, my feet burn. -Silent, everyone is looking. Mom, who are these people? -Is it a festival? -All are our relatives. All are our relatives? I believed except for dad, I had no other relative on this planet. Come on. -Oh! -Hello. Hey, Anbu! Anbu! How are you, Anbu? When I look at Anbu, I see only Anbu. Arivu, I believe the doctor doesn't know what we know. Let's go, doctor. Oh, God, the reaper has arrived. -Look over there, buddy. -Doctor, who is that? He's your cousin. -My cousin... -Hey! He's not your cousin. He's your enemy. Hello! For God sake, please understand. Let's go. -Hey, keep an eye on them. -Your grandpa is here. -Ignore him and keep walking. -Mom, let's go on the merry-go-round. Dear, are leaving home? -Yes, dad. -Fine, you carry on. Anbu, come over here. Let him come with me. I'll bring him home. You carry on. -You leave. -Chill mom. Chill, chill! -Grandpa. -Anbu... Singaram was the one who punctured your car. So, we're about to indulge in a rumpus. Be ready. Anbu, the stuff we need for prayer is inside the boot. Pick what suits you the best. Prayers? I don't get it. -It's high time we settle the score. -ru-um-pus! -It means incident. -Hey, what did your grandpa say? Incidentally they're about to offer prayers. Hey, they're known for bloody action. What doctor? What are you looking at? Hey, tell me exactly what your grandpa said? Grandpa said, rumpus. And Dheena mentioned prayers. Hey, rumpus is not just an incident... that means weapons, stabbing and fight. What the? Anbu! Don't get caught! Hey, come on. Let's go! Hey, hacked down the old man. Come on, everyone! Hurry up everyone. Come on, hurry up! -Rukmani, what happened? -A fight broke out at the temple. I have no idea what happened. My husband has gone to the temple. I heard Muniyandi, Sire, is outraged! Oh, no, Arivu? Anbu is the heir to our legacy! How dare you kidnap him? Had you rightfully asked Anbu for it... he would've accepted you as a brother. I would've let go of the differences and let you live with us. But you kidnapped Anbu like a crook just as your father. That makes you my enemy too. Dad, please don't do it. Lakshmi, he's not our Anbu. He's not Anbu! -He was raised by that man. -I know that, dad. You knew? Do you even know that he kidnapped, Anbu? I knew. Oh, so you changed sides, is it? Love has blinded you. Did you forget the humiliation we went through all these years? It's not like that dad. Tell me why did you support his criminal behavior? I was sick worried thinking what happened to Anbu. I've been sleepless and was restless like a crazy person. He's the reason behind it. Do you still consider him as your son? Dear, I realized that you lived with me all these years against your wish. -Go. -Mom, don't fear. He's talking without understanding. Hey, it's you who has not understood. -Me? -You should've left when I told you. Mom, I don't get it... Grandpa, you're getting my mom all worked up. Bloody who are you calling, grandpa? Anbu is my only grandson. He's my blood. But you're his blood. Oh, okay. Let mom say it. She'll say it. She'll definitely say. Dear, tell him he's not your son and not to call you his mother. Say it! ♪ Sing me lullaby That I've longed all my life ♪ ♪ Put me to sleep For restless I've been all my life ♪ ♪ Feed me with love... ♪ Oh, so he's right about it. -Oh, God, that's not the case. -Are you sure? I swear, dad. Did you see? If she considered you as a son, she would've stopped me. Hey, you're not my son. -Mom? -Right or wrong... Anbu always does everything right. He's my son. He's my only son. Hereafter don't come to my family. -Go! Go away, -Please mom. Ma'am, it's not right for a Goddess to cry on the street. Son, your father played with people's respect and honor. You're doing the same, son. They asked you to leave. Please go. -Mom! -Don't call me mom. I said go. So, please go! -Mom, please, mom. -Come on, dad. Let's go. If Anbu doesn't return... ♪ Hold me into arms Don't shatter my dreams ♪ ♪ You are my both the eyes ♪ ♪ You are my dream ♪ ♪ You are my tear drops ♪ ♪ My Elixir! ♪ Boss, why are we sitting here? -Hey, baldie! -Yes, Boss! Yes, Boss! I'm done marking you guys. Now begins Anbu's rumpus! Rumpus? Why is he smiling? So, Prakasam pays you guys 1.5 lakhs per month Indian money. What is your job description? Boss, we're fully responsible for your family's safety. Full security! So, you provide security to Prakasam and Arivu. Boss, that includes you too. -Me too! -Yes, Boss. -A man comes with a gun... -CODE RED -CODE RED Guys chill! -Take it, a man comes with a gun. -Okay! And is about to kill me. What would you do? I'll kill him boss! -What if he's about to kill Prakasam? -I'll still kill him too, boss. What if I'm the person who is about to kill, Prakasam? Boss, come on, stop kidding with us. -Kidding? -That's right, you won't kill him. Why? Boss, you're his son. You're family. What did you say? -Family? -Yes, boss! Did I say I'm his son? Did I? Did I? Where the hell are you running off to? See you, sister. -Lucky escape! -Hey, stop right there. Why is she coming towards me? Hi, Anbu. How are you? She's saying something. I don't understand. I am Yazhini, I'm Arivu's friend. Uncle said that Arivu's brother has arrived. So, I came down to meet you. You sing well. Boss, she's speaking in Tamil. Sri-Lankan Tamizh! I know. Madurai Tamil, China Tamil, Sri-Lankan Tamizh. Anbu always loves Tamil. Yeah, right! Why are you cooped up inside the house? It's a beautiful country. Come on let's hang out. You don't want to? Until I don't make Prakasam go mad in this house... I won't step out this house. But it'll be rude if I turn down your invitation. -Yazhini, come here! -Yeah, aunty, I'm coming. -Yazhini! Yazhini! -I'll see you later, Anbu. What is it, aunty? Boss? Boss?! Wait. I'm savoring the moment. This is the first time a girl has kissed me. That kiss is making me blush. Boss, in this country that's how people greet each other. Oh, no, I forgot to reciprocate the greeting. -Shall I go and bid bye to her? -Boss, don't act cheap. Don't peg me for a person who'd be lured by hugs. I'm a different person, dude! Anbu, don't get distracted. Stay sharp! How long do you expect me to stay alone in this house? I would like to go shopping and to the beach along with you. -Will you take me out? -Dear, you don't have to get out. Your shopping needs will walk home to you. There's a private beach right in front of the house. If you still insist on going out... some jerk might shoot a video then remix one of your scenes into a MEME. Here you go again! That's why I bought you a beach house so you can live like a Queen out there. What else do you need? Hey, hold on, I'll be right there. Call my assistant if you need more money. -I already asked him. -Okay, I shall hang up. Get lost! Hey, what is it? Sir, he installed a tent at the center of the village. Welcome, everyone. I'm surprised that you're here unannounced. Pasupathy, didn't we ask him to leave the village? You're right. You asked me to leave your house. This is my place. That's right. My grandfather owns it and the grandson has rights to it. Didn’t I tell you that I have no ties with you? Why do you still claim relation to us? Destroy his tent! Folks, that's enough! I yelled well before you people did. Okay, chill, chill, chill! -One minute. Moolai! -Bro? I think he doesn't understand English. As per the law, he has every right to this land. You have no right to state laws over here. Don't you dare speak against a lawyer. Then your wealth--wealth-- It might lead to dividing the wealth in equal shares. -The law states it. -Thank goodness he saved me. Son, how can you be disrespectful to Sire and speak about dividing the wealth? Your mother too disowned you as a son. Uncle, I couldn't bear the beatings from my grandpa... as my mother loves me dearly... she said it to save me from him. It doesn't count. The mistakes I committed 25 years ago... is haunting me even today. Hey, you've been messing around with grandpa a lot. -Don't step out alone. -Okay, bro. Go! Come on, everyone leave. Come on, leave! Uncle. The folks of this village don't spare a concrete house. But you live in a tent. Be careful, they might burn it down. Uncle, as far as you're there no one can harm me. I'll take a leave. Arivu is trying to confuse my daughter by creating drama. He diligently takes after his father. Sire, I can understand your woes. That's why I came with a good news that'll bring you joy. People from a foreign country came to MLA hostel. Not sure which country... Sir, it's a German company. Yeah, people from a German company came to meet me. Two villages nearby Theni... they're planning to open a company pertaining to agriculture. If that happens the entire village will be employed. They can earn around 50-60 thousand per month. Why should you go to Theni? When our villages are good enough. I told them if you're okay with it, we can proceed. Pasupathy, you're naive just like me. You've dedicated your life to this village. Let's proceed with it. -You may leave now. -Thank you. I'll take a leave. -Listen, Pasupathy... -Yes, sire! it'll be better if you keep an eye on Arivu. Sure, sire. Watch out. How are you? Mom, you restricted me to come home. I'm an obedient son, mom. I heard you serve food to people over here. That's why I came here. Please serve, mom. Mom... imagine that I'm a stranger and serve me food. Please, mom! Hey, you put up a tent and now you're here to eat. -Hey, let him be. -Aunty, don't interfere. -Hey, get up. -Dheena, let him finish his meal. -Get lost! -Dheena don't do it. Aunty, you please stay out of it. Just because I respect you... I didn't do anything to him despite he kidnapped my friend. But he's going overboard. Listen, you're not aware of our traits. We can give our lives for our friends and even kill if needed. Dheena! Let go, aunty. You get lost! Please don't stay back. It's better if you leave. Go! Just because you installed a tent at the center of the village... you expected to change your mother's feelings for you. But it didn't happen. What next? Kayal, everything is a process. It'll take some time to change mom's feelings for me. Moreover, it'll take time for me to adapt to these conditions. Let's see. What happened, Arivu? Back in Canada, my father and I stay alone. But I never got this feeling. Here, I have my relatives everywhere and it's my native. I still feel very lonely, Kayal. This is not the Arivu I know. He's different and has clarity of things. He'll stay calm even struck by a storm. You're not alone. I'm here for you. Bye. In fact, I'm related too. Hello? Thank you, Ms. Relative. Bye! Singaram, tell him what you have to say. Brother, you're already aware of the situation. I've been waiting to land a small posting at your party. But no one in the village is even speaking about my work. Since the day, Arivu built a tent inside the village... he has become the talk of the town. On top of it, boys mentioned that he's been flirting with Kayal. What do you have in mind? During the chariot issue you suggested to burning down. Today, Arivu is the talk of the town. So, I've decided to take him out! That may cool down Muniyandi's anger towards me... and he might consider getting me a posting. Singaram has hit the nail on its head. Your candidacy is confirmed! Singaram, you've left him speechless. -Hey! -Brother? What did you just say? He has hit the nail on its head... Have you guys lost your senses? Who is Arivu? No matter what he's Muniyandi's grandson. Muniyandi is not that angry you peg him to be. But I'm sure that boy will instigate him. I'll tell you when to strike. Until then keep watch like an eagle. Okay, brother. I'm working hard to gain respect and to settle down in life. You're great! Your hard work will take you places, Singaram! Okay, brother. Bye, Venkat. Hereafter, Singaram, is going to tail Arivu relentlessly. Yeah, right, he'll tail Arivu. But has no sense at all, bloody fool. He'll remain a henchman. Useless bugger! Start the car! Hey, dance! Anbu! Anbu, lower the volume. I said, lower the volume. Are you getting angry, nanny? Lower the volume! Dance, damn it! Dance! -Hello, sir. -Hi, Ruben. Please come. Yeah! -Take a seat. -Thank you. Then? Sir... Arivu? That's my son. He's rehearsing a dance. He somehow managed it. Sir, coming Sunday is my grandson's Baptism. You should come over and bless him as his Godfather. Hey, what are you doing, Ruben? I thought people abroad were well-dressed and intelligent. -But you're a fool. -Anbu! Nanny, shush! You see, Ruben... he's not even fit to be a father. And you want him to be the Godfather. He abandoned me when I was 1.5 years old. He's a runaway. If you let him bless your grandson... then he'll turn into a runaway too. Ruben, you were about to make a mistake. He's a fraud! He's a fraud! -Escape from here Ruben. Escape! -I'm sorry, sir. I think the time is not right. See you, sir. Hey, Prakasam! Come on, boys. Let's go! Go! Hey, guys, please move! Shall I sing a motivational song for you? Please go! Oh, no! See, I'm Anbu's brother and grandpa's grandson. Okay? Let's do this together. Come on, co-operate. Okay, let's go. Ready? Okay! Move! Move! You listen to him. But you don't listen to me. Please move! Even the cow could spot a difference between the good and the evil. Okay? Shall we move? Yeah! Did you see it? Even your cow could spot the difference between good and evil. Only, you're oblivious to it. Have you just decided to keep humiliating me? Grandpa, why are you so angry at me? As soon as I knew that I have a grandfather... I came down right away to meet you. But why are you treating me like your enemy? Don't sass me with your drama. Grandpa, I did ask mom to come along with me... and stay together as a family. Mom, did agree to come with me. But she needs your permission. She has no issues to come along with me to abroad. In fact, it's you who has a problem. Grandpa, bear this in mind... her respect will sustain only if you stay a loving father. It's better you change. If not, I'll change it! How dare you speak of changing me? Don't ask me to change. This is how I am. Damn, that was a strong one! Grandpa, this is Anbu speaking. How are you? I'll whack you. Didn't I ask you to stay away from me? You're continuing to lie. Why should I lie? Grandpa, during childhood you used to sing praises of me. Did you forget? Remember I broke a guy's leg because he was leaning on your car? Or a year ago I broke a guy's arm for not greeting you. Do you at least remember that? Grandpa, have you totally forgotten about me? Hey, Anbu. My prince, how are you? Grandson, how are you? Grandpa, your voice is neither magnificent nor agile. -It's nothing, son... -Erm? Fine, you told me everything he did. Tell me, what did you do to him? Grandpa, I think a small part of you still considers him as your grandson. I think that's why you're hesitating. I've been giving Prakasam a tough time. He's stuck with me as he's not able to kick me out neither can bear me. Do you think you could've spared a man from Aandiyaapuram? His father is from Aandiyaapuram. So is he. Show that boy what truly the name Muniyandi stands for. Pasupathy! Arivu, I believe in abroad having many girlfriends... and hanging out with them is very common. How about you? That culture does exists. Also, there's true love. During childhood, I used to watch a lot of Tamil films. Also, I've read Tamil literature. So, I've already made a decision. If I get married that'll be to a good Tamil girl. How about you? Men stalking you at the bus stop and chasing you behind with love letters. Obviously, you're very beautiful. Were there any such instances? Should I say it too? -Singaram! -Who is Singaram? -Oh, that cousin. -Why is he here? -Singaram, make sure to do it right. -I'll handle it. Don't worry. Kayal, it's 9 P.M. Are you here to tell her the time? They're quite busy. I'll inform them later. You may leave. Hey! Kayal, get back home. Bro, chill bro. Chill! Why do you look so agitated? Hey, I have full rights to speak to her the way I see fit. Who are you to ask me? Your to-be-bride? Oh, no, all this while I was under the impression she's my to-be-bride. Hey, sarcasm is it? Kayal, how can you let anyone speak down to me? What did your father tell you? Arivu... my father has asked me to get married to Singaram. Brother, I hope you heard her. -I hope you understand. -Singaram! But I'll get married only to Arivu. What? It worked. Bro! Bro! Thank you, bro! -I love you, bro. Thank you-- -Let go, damn it! You two are trying to humiliate me, is it? No, they're humiliating you separately. Singaram, don't create a scene. You'll regret it later. You're going to regret for sure. -Bro... Bro... -Get lost! You love me? Singram, bro, if not for you this wouldn't have happened. -Arivu calm down. -Thank you, bye. -Let me leave the love-birds alone. -Moolai, please leave. Bye! I'll take care of him buddy. You carry on. Since I met you I fell in love. -Bro, who are you? -Hey, tear down the tent. -Bro... Bro? -Kayal, you leave! -What the hell? -Bro, where are you going? -Didn’t we ask you to leave? -Bro, hold on. -Hey, hold his hand. -Arivu! -Throw everything out. -Let him go. Listen, he's a poor thing. Please! Let me go! Bro, please, bro. Oh, no, Arivu! -Bro! Why bro? -Let him go. Why won't you leave the village? You're going to end up dead. You guys have no conscience? -Hey! -Arivu! -Hey... -Bro, it's hurting. Beat him up, damn it! -Hey, buddy. -Run, damn it! -Hey, come on! -Hurry up! He was elected as a Minister by us. Pasupathy always has a good interest for this village. He has come bearing good news. I hope everyone is fine with it? We all agree, Sire! Sounds like a good news though. Then let's all sign the required documents. Sure, we'll sign it, Sire! Excuse me! May I come in please? Over here. Look up! Look up! I am back! Just wait. I'm coming down. Hi uncles! Hello Mullai! Hi! I don't feel good about this plan. Hi, mom! Hey, the villagers will discuss among themselves. You better mind your own business. Hey, I belong to this village too. A lease for 99 years means... that you've almost sold your land. Corporate tactics. The land will be ours for namesake. But the corporate company will hold the rights to the land. You're here just to create confusion. -Grandpa-- -Dad, hold on. It doesn't matter who's saying it. What matters is what they're saying. Thank you, mom. Ask them to draw an agreement based on crops. After that we'll sign the documents. I am not sure if they'll agree to it. If they agree it's a deal. If not cancel it. Close! Sounds about right! Sire, let's be smart about it. It's a matter of millions. Let's not sell it to them for a very low price. Brilliant, uncle! Nowadays, there's no respect for the wise men. Okay, Pasupathy. Speak to everyone and get it sorted. Okay, Sire. It's time that you leave the village. Bye, uncle. Bye. Okay. Okay, sir. We'll discuss. We'll discuss. Don't worry, I'll talk to sir. Sir, I tried my best to speak to the Germans with my half-baked English. But they are quite hesitant about the deal. The deal was almost done... but Arivu spoiled my plan just like his father. On top it Lakshmi is singing to his tunes. Had I closed this deal... I would've settled down from the commission from it. I would've bought the votes and won the elections by landslide. Who is it? Is that Chellaatha's son? I did meet him the other day. Hey! -You don't say... -He must've made an excuse. I don't think so. -Oh, no, this guy! -Anbu! Everyone please sit down. I'm not Anbu. I am Arivu. I came down from Canada. How are you people doing? I am your great grandmother. How are you? How's everyone at home? Only now you thought of us. To keep uncle happy, you never bothered to check on us. Not even once you think of checking upon us. Did you even know that I existed? Arivu, how are you, my child? How is my brother? We were left with no option. What happened was not an ordinary matter. The day my brother went to live with his in-laws... split this house into two. Later, we just followed your uncle. But my father remembers everything. He talks of this village, relatives and the love bestowed on him. I know everything about you people. That's why I'm here to meet you, folks. We're very happy, son. Hold on for a minute. I have a surprise for you folks. -Hi Arivu. -Dad, shush! A VIP wanted to talk to you. Brother! How are you brother? I'm really happy brother! I feel like meeting you right away. When will you come home? Brother, we've always prayed for your well being. Arivu, I've never seen them so happy until now. Thanks a lot. I've never ever met them before. Thanks to you. Kayal, do you agree to marry him? We're very happy about it. But her father will never go back on his word. He has asked to start prepping for Kayal-Singaram's wedding next month. If he comes to know you're here, my husband and Singaram might harm you. It's better you leave before they get home. Kayal, bring me coffee upstairs. -Oh, no, dad! -Please leave. Here's your coffee, uncle. Sugarless! Please sit down, uncle. That's enough respect. Please sit down. How are you uncle? Uncle, I'm speaking to you. How are you?! Until now I was doing well. God knows something might go wrong with you over here. You're going to do great, uncle! It's not good manners to ask the guests to leave the house. That's why I like you, uncle. Okay, get to the point. Why are you here? I heard you've started preparing for Kayal's wedding. So, I am here to help you as a nephew. Singaram is there to help me with it. That's fine, as a probable groom Singaram can help you with the wedding preparations. Instead, let me get married to Kayal. You are looking to revive our ties, is it? Did your father send here to divide the wealth, is it? -Wealth? -Yes. Uncle, you won't understand how much my father's net worth is. Listen, to me and my family, Singaram is everything. I have given my word to him. My daughter will not break my trust. You better leave from here. She's definitely a good daughter to you. She may also agree to your terms and get married to Singaram. Also, she'll bear his children. Eventually, she'll forget about me. But she'll never forget what you did to her. In her heart, you won't be a loving father. In fact, you'll remain a father who crushed her dreams. To all the girls their fathers are their heroes. But you'll turn villain to Kayal. You call Muniyandi grandpa a fanatic! But he threw away his principles... and got her daughter married as per her wish. What are you going to do, uncle? You're well-educated. And you know how to manipulate. Sunshine after a cloudy day. The silence before a storm. And the clarity after your confusion. All of it will end well. I hope you'll make the right decision. Have your coffee and think about it. Bye, uncle. Bye. Initially when you arrived I thought your ideas won't work out. But now I trust you. Not just me. But my entire family. Dad will handle Singaram. But he wants your mother and grandpa to come and ask my hand in marriage. I have faith in you that you can make it happen. Hey, Arivu, I'm not done talking. Where are you going? Since I got here you were the spark to everything. For the first time I'm getting positive vibes from you. Now that uncle is convinced. The countdown for grandpa has begin. He too will change. ♪ Hey, you have let me wail badly ♪ ♪ I have been shattered by you ♪ ♪ You have let me wail so badly, hey! ♪ ♪ I have been shattered by you ♪ ♪ After seeing you once I haven’t slept for a week ♪ ♪ You don't have to graze I'm on fire, already! ♪ ♪ You are a painting made Over a bright day ♪ ♪ Everyone knows you ♪ ♪ I am enslaved by your beauty, You beast ♪ ♪ I am giddy with love for you, You crazy ♪ ♪ Sweetheart, you explode like a cracker ♪ ♪ You're sparkling and shattering ♪ ♪ You sparkle, sparkle, sparkle ♪ ♪ You smile, smile, smile ♪ ♪ You are crushing my heart ♪ ♪ Till the day I met you... ♪ ♪ I never had time to talk about women ♪ ♪ After I was mesmerized by you... ♪ ♪ I could not talk about Anything else but you ♪ ♪ I am shattered into pieces ♪ ♪ By looking at your beauty I'm shattered into pieces ♪ ♪ You have shattered me By making me wail ♪ ♪ You have made me wail By shattering me ♪ ♪ By your beauty, you beast ♪ ♪ By your love, you crazy ♪ ♪ Hey, you have let me wail badly ♪ ♪ I have been shattered by you ♪ ♪ You have let me wail so badly, hey! ♪ ♪ I have been shattered by you ♪ ♪ Sweetheart, you explode like a cracker ♪ ♪ Sweetheart, you explode like a cracker ♪ ♪ You're exploding and shattering ♪ ♪ You sparkle, sparkle, sparkle ♪ ♪ You smile, smile, smile ♪ ♪ You are crushing my heart ♪ Arivu, truck! Thanks for buying me tea, Arivu. Come on, hurry up! Start the car. Hey, why did you stop? -Hey, what are you doing? -Where are you going? Oh, no! Brother, not to worry! Grandpa, step out of the car. I said get out of the car. Son, he belongs to a separate village. Matter of a life, brother! Son, please don't do it. Get lost, man! Hey, drive carefully! -Kayal, how is mom? -Mom is out of danger. She lost a lot of blood. But she's okay. Thank God. Due to heavy blood loss, we had to do a blood transfusion. In another 2 hours mom will be fine. Listen, doctor, Lakshmi ma'am is like a Goddess to this village. She has to return to her normal-self. Understood? Doctor, how is the other man doing? He's out of danger too. You brought them right on time. So, both are out of danger. Thank God. Thank you, doctor. Grandpa, they said mom is out of danger. Why do you look so serious? Son, you're not aware of the norms of this village... and you continue to disrespect them. Sire, is like a God to us. And his car is like a chariot to us. If it was Anbu, he wouldn't have let anyone touch it. But you took a man from Aandiyaapuram and disturbed his sanctity. Damn! Damn! Oh, my God. Damn it! How could I do this? What the fish? Sorry, grandpa! Uncle! Sorry, uncle. Sorry, uncle. Son, don't stress about it. Let it go. I can't just let it slide, uncle. Doctor, you did a blood transfusion, right? Did you check if it belonged to the folks of Arasapuram? Are you serious? What if it turned out to be from the folks of Aandiyaapuram? It's not imperative for my mother to live on a strangers' blood. Go and stop it, doctor. Go! Arivu, if we do that, your mother will die. It's okay, doctor. To my grandpa his ideals matters the most. Are you going to stop it? Or shall I do it myself? -Arivu, have you gone mad. -Son, don't do it! -Get back here. -Grandpa, I'm doing this for you. Don't you have any sense? Don't you love your mother? Earlier you were hurting her. And now you're trying to kill her. Oh, I get it now. If it's your dear daughter your principles don't matter to you. But if it's a stranger then your principles cloud your judgment. My father raised me to believe all lives matter. If Anbu turned out to be an animal, who's to be blamed? You raised him to believe discrimination is the way of life. How dare you accuse me of it? -You think I didn't raise him well? -Yes, grandpa. When a child is born they're unaware of discrimination. It's while raising a child, people poison them with discrimination. The issue doesn't limit to this town. It's spread across the world. Dheena, the internet was invented to reduce the distance and bring us together. But in this digital world... specifically, youth like us are spreading hate and discrimination. There's no end to the list of discrimination. Just because you discriminate... many folks like me... are left without a nation and a home... also lose relatives, love and affection. In the end, we're orphaned of love and relations. Grandpa, a true leader is a person who doesn't discriminate... and guide them on to the right path. But the one who discriminates is a fool. So, tell me, grandpa, are you going to be a leader... -or you're-- -Oh, no, Arivu, please that's enough. Son, you went overboard. After all he's your grandpa. -Hey, go and get him. -Sire! You spoke your heart out. But that'll go over our heads. Because we're not smart enough to understand. But you were right about everything. You bear my friend's face. I can't hate this face. If you're his brother. Then you're my brother too. Please forgive me, Arivu. Mr. Pasupathy, we're very happy to close the deal with you. Sir, he's ready to close the deal with us. -Be respectful of him. -Sure, sir. We'll get back to you. Okay, Your Honor. Thank you. Bye-bye! -Check who's at the door. -Sure. -Brother, what brings you here? -I need to meet, uncle. Come in, son. Please come in. -Take a seat. -Hello uncle. What are you looking at? It's the evidence of my hard work. That's where I come from. Wow! -Superb uncle. -Please don't call me uncle. It makes me feel I'm old. Uncle, it'll eventually fade away. Okay, tell me, how can I help? Uncle, I found out who rammed into my mother's car. It was actually an attempt to kill me not my mother. -I'm sure it must be Singaram. -Oh! He must be pissed because Arivu is getting married to Kayal. Poor Lakshmi ma'am. Venkat come over here. Pass on this hand shake to uncle. Uncle, you're a very sharp person. Now that you've said it. I'm positive! Let's take put him on display in front of the village and punish him. After that, we should banish him from the village. Excellent! I too had the same suggestion. I'll support, you go ahead and execute it. This will induce some sense into them. You're saying things that I should be rightfully telling you. It's you who should be punished. But you're pointing to Singaram! Hey! It's you who is going to get punished. Da! Da! Does this make you feel young? I won't call you uncle anymore. Do you feel like a youth? I enquired about the story of my father leaving the village. You were the common character in every point of view. I had my suspicion on you. So, I dug deeper. An actress in Chennai is your wife... beach house on ECR and your son is studying in Kuwait. But you maintain a low profile out here. You've framed a torn shirt and a snapped pair of slippers... to fool the people of this village. Now it's confirmed. You're the culprit. Son, you're talking as if you're a big hero and I'm a supervillain. Listen, you're not even on my list. The plan was to kill your mother. When you come down from abroad, bring liquor and perfumes... then take a few pictures of the fields and temples. Finally, take a dive into the pond and be on your way. Don't make the mistake of interfering in local politics. Dear, I will definitely interfere. I won't leave this village until I hang you out dry. Do as you please. I've sealed the German deal. They agreed to take care of election expenses. Hereafter, I don't need your grandpa's support... neither I need the support of my party, caste or creed. I am the King now! You're just a Minister! Don't day dream. Buddy, wake up! Sir, I never knew you did so much 25 years ago. I've been with you all along and I never knew. But that kid cracked the code. To hell with him. Even if he has evidence no one would believe him. Sir, what makes you say that? Would you agree that you remained a fool for 25 years? -Obviously, I won't agree. -That's about it! No one will agree to it. They'll be in denial. Nanny! Okay, tell me what do you feed him? Vegan salad and wheat bread. After eating tasteless food... he has turned numb to insults. What kind of son are you? Calling your father with disrespect. Nonsense! Father? You mean him? He's my mother's husband. That's about it. As a father, he has not done anything for me. -He's pissed! -Uncle? What do you know about me? Do you even know how much we loved each other? Love? Listen, people who are in love... have eloped with their lovers to live together. But you abandoned your wife and kid for fame and money. You shouldn't talk about love. Now please don't start quoting love sagas. Listen, you're just an opportunist. That's about it. Anbu, you're crossing your limits. He struggled a lot to make money and to earn a good name. Hey! I'll bloody kill each and every one of you. Did I ask? Or did my mother ask for money and fame? It's not like you were the only person who struggled in their lives. Don't you think my mother would've struggled too? Hey, you would know the pain only if you grew up without a father. I stopped going to the school when I was 10-year-old. Not because I don't like studies. It's because my fellow students used to tease me saying that my father ran away. One day I went home crying to my mother... there I found her sitting in a corner and crying. And he was standing in front of her. "Come with me if you wish to. If not I'll leave." Are you coming with me or not? I was outraged and thew a stone to his head. Listen, if you wish to know the depth of my pain... touch your forehead. Even today the scar looks fresh. You'd like to call me names, right? Let me tell you who's to be blamed that I turned out like this. It's you. Only you! You were the first person I attacked. I didn't have a father to protect me. That's why I hit everyone who humiliated me. They'll scream and run for their lives. That's when I realized anger is my shield. And I turned into this person. Hey! Had you been with me I wouldn't have turned into this person. Tell me! Tell me, damn it! Tell me. Did you see? Once again he left. Get lost! -Anbu... Anbu... -Let go! -Please hear me out. -Let me go, Yazhini. Sorry! ♪ Separation and decisions ♪ ♪ Barriers that hinder relationships ♪ ♪ Few letters and poetry... ♪ ♪ may ignite the spark in relationships ♪ In my life, if I had to apologize to someone... that'll be only to you. I never apologized to you. Only after your opened up today I understood your pain. Please forgive me, Anbu. As a good father I have never done anything for you. Until your anger subsides... you are free to do anything to me. I will take that as my punishment. ♪ You've always been my son, dear ♪ ♪ But I'm here standing In front of you like a coward ♪ Sorry! ♪ Don't cry Don't be fooled ♪ ♪ Truth is told for good deeds ♪ He left you behind as a support to your mother. He didn't abandon you. Arivu understood this and is struggling out there to reunite them. You've been hurting your father without understanding it. Anbu, please throw away your anger. And look at the world with love. Fine, I'll handle it. Okay. We'll discuss in person. You too come along. I'll call you back later. I'm here to ask you for a favor. What do you think I can do that your father couldn't? Brother, I know that you're aware of Kayal and Arivu's relationship. If you keep aside the enmity and get them both married... and if she succeeds to change Arivu's heart and take him back to Canada... I'll be at peace. Because my father's anger towards him is getting stronger by the day. Every day I fear something worse might happen to him. Are you here to fix the alliance? Or you're here to save your son from your father? Just like your father, I'm a loving father too. My family feels proud that you came over to ask my hand in marriage. Shall I ask you for a favor? What do you want, dear? You should convince Arivu to stay with the in-laws after the wedding. I'm a doted daughter just like you. Just 'cause Muniyandi's daughter stepped down... are you looking to settle your old scores? Mom! Hi! Where are you headed, mom? Please wait. Back then what your father asked my father... is what Kayal asked you today. Back then you found that right. But now it feels wrong to you. Don't you think you're being partial? I'm asking because I don't understand. Are you confused or you're selfish? I don't think my mother is selfish. Had you been selfish you would've led a happy life. Uncle, am I right? We understood well, son. I hope Lakshmi understood too. Dad, I went through all the documents. The agreement is drawn for the crops not for the land. Pasupathy has never failed to deliver when it involves you and me. Thanks a lot, sire. Sire, there's a small issue at hand. An unwanted person... has sent an anonymous mail stating that our villages are not united. The folks of a German company are a bit scared about it. In order to show that both the villages are united... why don't we organize an event? Something on the lines of one-day development... when a President from abroad arrives. Similar to that. It's not Anbu's birthday. What else? Grandpa, why don't we organize the Chariot carnival? As it is the Collector is on our backs about it. Dheena, you're absolutely right. If we organize the event and return the chariot to the temple... the long standing feud will end. Also the folks from both the villages will be happy. Lakshmi ma'am you spoke like a Goddess. If this happens I'll be at peace too. Okay, Pasupathy without hurting the sentiments of the Germans, organize a grand event. Buddy, why do you look so dejected? Rightfully we should feel dejected. We thought you'll get a posting... and we could tag along with you. Unfortunately, you left us hanging. At least we thought you'll marry your cousin... and we could use your father-in-law's influence. But your uncle tagged along with Arivu and screwed you over. They'll succeed only if the chariot carnival takes place. How can you pull it off all alone? You can't do squat about it. Bloody, do I look like a loser to you? How long do you plan to get humiliated by the folks of Arasapuram? I'm going to bring chaos at Muniyandi's house. The guy who's been roaming around claiming both the villages... Arivu? If we kill him... the chariot carnival won't happen... -also there will be no wedding. -You're right, buddy. A single strike will bring everything down. That old man has no other business. -Hey! -Hold on to me! Buddy, I hope you're not hurt. Get up! Who are these men? I called them as a back-up from another village. Singaram, it's not brave to attack from behind. Hey, you're not even on my list. You better scram! Arivu, I feel outraged by just looking at your face. I'm going to kill you for what you and your brother has done to me. Listen, this incident will set an example in this district. Hack him! Buddy, do you think they'll kill me? These guys are not worth it, Anbu. You came to hit him but you froze. Are you scared? You guys still can't figure out who is it? Brother, it's Anbu! Buddy, whack the hell out of him! Listen, please come over here. -Anbu, nail them to the ground! -♪ Ready, steady, go ♪ ♪ The effect of hurricane Will be felt from all the sides ♪ ♪ Everybody, lose control ♪ ♪ There is definitely going to be unrest ♪ Singaram! ♪ All stay away, stay away ♪ ♪ If I arrive, it will be a rumpus All should bow down ♪ ♪ If we fold up our dhothi, There is bound to be a problem ♪ ♪ Our actions will be sudden ♪ ♪ Be careful, take care ♪ ♪ If we fold up our dhothi, There is bound to be a problem ♪ ♪ Our actions will be sudden ♪ ♪ Be careful, take care ♪ -Tell me. -Brother, Anbu has returned. -Then kill Singaram. -Okay, brother. Kill him. Don't spare him. Hey-Hey! Why are you holding me back? Hey, kill him! Nothing to worry. Partner, what exactly is your problem? You brought men to kill my brother... but they turned on you and were about to kill you. They are pitting us against each other for their personal gain. All you need is a posting, right? You can have it. And do good to people. That's about it. At least hereafter let's stay united. Buddy, are you Anbu or Arivu? Your clarity is astounding! It's fate that Arivu had to induce sense into all of us. -You're right. -Let's go. Come on, I like you a lot. Without you, there's no excitement in life. Life gets boring. Let's go! Sire, please hold on. You can't go up there. Please step down. Please step down. I'll explain everything. As there are Germans present on the stage... the stage is under CBI's control. So, it's them who are managing the list of delegates that'll be attending the event. The list prepared by them does not have your name. -Hey! -What is it? How dare you speak down on him? Sire, please welcome. Did you see I've organized a grand event. That's fine, but what's all this nonsense? Sire, the visitors are Germans and foreigners. CBI has ordered that only people in authority can be present on the stage. Why don't you sit on the couch in the first row? Sir, that spot is reserved for the Ministers. Oh, no, is it? Fine, please sit behind that row on the cushion-seats. -Sir! -What now? That row is reserved for MPs, MLAs and business officials. Idiot, can't you inform me in prior? Sire, I'll direct you to the right spot now. The row way behind, please sit on the plastic chairs. -Hey... -Instead of standing... Showing your true colors, is it? Bloody dog! I gave you this post as alms, damn it! Already forgot is it? Sire! I stayed bent over for a very long time. Hold on for a minute. Did you just call me a dog? Agreed that I am a dog. But not your pet dog that I used to be. But a greyhound! Dogs are supposed to bite. Hey! You'll kill me, is it? Where's your machete? Is it on your hip or on your back? Or it's in your car? The reason why I am asking is... if someone spots you with it... they might arrest you for an attempt to murder a Govt. representative. After that no one can bail you out. This village folks only trust me. No one can dare to lay their hands on me. We run our politics by keeping you under that illusion. There's a fanatic in every village... that we use as a pawn in politics. When I can kill your friend and breakup your family. It's easy for me to throw you away from the village too. It's my long-term dream. Finally came to fruition. -Pandiya. -Tell me, sir. Poor thing. He's very old and might faint. Please make him sit in a corner. Let's begin the event without any hassles. Sire, he has already spoken. Why are you still standing out here? Greetings to one and all. You're about to witness a historical event. The chariot-carnival that was suspended for the past 15 years... a mighty person has independently revived this event. She's talking about me. A mighty warrior People's King Revolutionary the future of this nation thanks to, Sire, Pasupathy! A big hand everyone! It's high time we change, grandpa. As you were stubborn, evil gained opulence. The village has been divided into two. Also our families broke up! Due to this only Arivu and I lost everything in life. Anbu? Hey, dear, I'm your Anbu. Anbu! Grandpa, we've been living like fools. He kept adding fuel and we continued to burn in it. We've never respected another human being. We've always judged them based on their caste. For the past 25 years, he took advantage of your anger. Grandpa, you're gravely hurt because you had to step down from the stage. Imagine their pain as we kept them oppressed all these years. We have decided to stay united. Soon... make up your mind and take a decision. Hey, let's go. I hereby invite the German delegates on the stage... to flag off the event. Pasupathy, I'm not the boss. My boss is coming over there. He's not the boss, is it? Hey, Venkat, start the music. Come on, hurry up! Here you go! Come on, play all the instruments. Sir hurry up. Our guardian angel has arrived. When I return a successful man... the person who kicked me out of the house and also this village will celebrate me with a garland. Hello, friend.

Greetings to one and all. Returning the favor to our roots... is what makes one a complete human. My son Arivu, imparted this wisdom to me. By reminding me about love and anger... I was brought to a balance by... my eldest son, Anbu. I'm here because... my father-in-law accepted me without discrimination. The King of Arasapuram, Muniyandi. Thank you! Sire. I'm not Sire to you. Call me father-in-law. You're my son-in-law. Father-in-law! -You please make the speech. -Me? My sincere apologies to all the folks of this village. Specifically, I apologize to my daughter and son-in-law. You'll think I was cruel all this while and have suddenly turned into a saint. I did commit mistakes. But now I'm speaking after realizing my mistakes. I'm from the old times and remained naive. Neither I was raised well nor I raised anyone well. Despite many hurdles... my son-in-law grew successful and also raised a very good son. That's good upbringing. Instead of killing the animal inside me... Arivu took the beating himself and changed my heart. Arivu, you keep asking me one thing... to hear you out. Now, you take the mic and we'll listen to everything. Come on, son! Come on, speak up. Selvi, sister, has your son returned home? Yes, he did. Son, he's asking about you. I see a lot of young people in the crowd. I believe the carnival has lured you here. It's a very good concept. In fact, I came down to take my mom back to Canada. But when I arrived I really loved this village. And I loved you all. I liked the unconditional love you showered on me. I loved my grandpa's magnificence. I decided to stay back. But you people were not united. You've parted ways for some reason and were not independent. I realized it within a few days of my stay. You consider the cow as a God. But why do you discriminate among humans? There's a huge politics at play that makes us discriminate. Let me put it in simple words. The cricket match between India and Pakistan... also the match between RCB and CSK why do you think we watch them as fanatics? Is there enmity between us? Or do we have any conflicts? A partition of this sort is induced in our minds to hate one another. And that hate is materialized by someone to grow in politics. I found out that a similar person broke this village and my family... and fooled everyone to succeed in politics. If I want my family and village to come together... only the person who broke them up can reunite them. That's why I asked our company to come down and do business in this village. To do good for my native, I had to give him 100 crores as commission. You may ask who? Our mighty warrior! And your beloved Minister, Pasupathy, uncle. He demanded bribe from my father. We recorded everything. If you see the footage playing on that screen. You can see that Pasupathy, uncle, is working hard. Without a doubt that's him! Uncle, you stained the entire village... but you wear a white shirt and white veshti. Uncle, CBI is not here to provide you with security They're here to arrest you. Confused? Arrest! Arrest! No, not me just him. Please take him away. Finally, the village got rid of the evil that engulfed it. Let me tell you all one thing. Life is short. Until we're alive respect your fellow human... love them dearly stay united with your relatives and live a prosperous life. In a world where everyone is in a hurry stepping over each other. Love is... Knowledge! I hope you heard my brother. Everyone should stay united. Just because I turned soft and started wearing western clothes... and may return abroad. If someone even dared to wag their tails. Then you'll face the wrath of Anbu. You won't applaud if I speak, is it? Applause! So, who do we crown the diadem? Is it going to be Sire, Muniyandi or Prakasam, sir? If we continue to limit this tradition to our family... it will send a wrong message. What is about to happen right now should be followed by all the villages. Just watch, grandpa! ♪ Can love induce knowledge? ♪ ♪ Knowledge is derived from love! ♪ ♪ Love is the solution To end indifference ♪ ♪ Love can bring us together ♪ ♪ It breaks the barriers bring us closer ♪ ♪ In this world all lives matter ♪ ♪ All praise to the One ♪ ♪ All praise to the Almighty! ♪ ♪ All praise to the One ♪ ♪ All praise to the Almighty! ♪ ♪ The world is surrounded by water ♪ ♪ Just as love surrounds all lives ♪ ♪ In order for everyone To live in harmony ♪ ♪ Love is knowledge ♪ ♪ The world is surrounded by water ♪ ♪ just as love surrounds all lives ♪ ♪ In order for everyone To live in harmony ♪ ♪ Love is knowledge ♪
