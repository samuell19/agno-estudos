Once upon a time, there was a box of precious cassette tapes, forgotten in a shelf somewhere. Variações wrote before he died... and never recorded. And I will go on looking for my shape and for my place 'Cause this far I have only: Want who I have never seen I only look for who I've never met It was then that 7 people from different musical universes got together to bring them to life. Such a treasure could not remain hidden. Camané? Where's Camané? I'm unable to control This anxiety I live in This need to get there fast So I won't get there late Got no idea what I'm running from Maybe it's my solitude But why do I refuse to accept The hand that people give to me And I will go on looking for The person that I'm waiting for 'Cause until now I only: Want who I have never seen I only look for who I've never met I only look for who I've never seen I only look for who I've never met I only look for Who I've never seen Humanos – Life with Variações The first time I saw António Variações on TV, if I'm not mistaken, he was dressed as a pill. Singing something about the pill, take your pill or something like that. At the time, I was a kid, and it caught my eye, more because of his exuberance than because of the song. I did doubt whether he was really that talented, or if he had simply been different. Because so many times difference is mistaken for talent, I think. When I heard the demos, I was absolutely sure that he was not only different, but also an extremely talented man. Because they showed the songs in the purest state. Nobody does demos this way nowadays. I'd never heard demos like these, just sung into a recorder, and sounding this good. I will live Just for how long I do not know I Want To Live (original demo) What does it matter what I'll become I just want to live We were given a series of songs by António and we decided to create a band to do the work. We created an identity of our own. Because after working together for a while we felt that these were no longer António's songs but ours. It had to be that way for us to be able to create something. We tried to pick up popular instruments, ukuleles, campaniça guitars, kick drums... But to play them in our own way because of our pop background. That's where we come from and we wanted to bring both together. Maria Albertina (original demo) Maria Albertina please allow me to say I know your name doesn't Really sound like much... It is with great pleasure and huge satisfaction that I award you the Triple Platinum for sales of the Humanos album. Thanks, man. We don't deserve it. It was very surprising, at least for me, how the record caught on with people so quickly. And the fact that it sold a lot, especially when you think how much is a lot right now. We were recording an album in unusual conditions. In a country house, in a studio with daylight. We were really having lots of fun, living together, like a holiday camp, building up friendships. And I think that shows in the record. Goodbye for I am now leaving... We really enjoyed working together a lot. It was a very interesting discovery. This is kind of a big band, a super group. You think so? None of us feels like a super artist. We're not that popular to make up a super group. We don't feel like that, and none of us has that kind of profile. Although originally this was a commission, if we hadn't fallen in love with what we heard, if we hadn't felt intrigued by working together, this would have gone nowhere. It's the teamwork that really matters. Being able to work week after week to earn the trust of the coach and of the supporters. What matters is to go on and to believe. Half year after the album release, they rehearsed arduously for the four mythical concerts that Summer. I'm beginning to see My first few wrinkles There's a lot to rehearse before the concerts. We try to do our best on the rehearsal. The day of the gig can be completely different from the rehearsal. Because it's a lot about spontaneity and the way that specific moment connects with the audience, with the venue we're playing. I start to frown Wrinkles from crying Wrinkles from smiling “My first few wrinkles are growing on me”, was such a good idea and made me think of an image of António, older. I started thinking of dancehalls, and the entire arrangement was made thinking of that. Wrinkles from crying Wrinkles from smiling Wrinkles from singing I start to frown Wrinkles from crying Wrinkles from smiling Wrinkles from singing Wrinkles from feeling Initially we had thought of Camané to sing this. But when we were trying out the arrangement, Camané wasn't around and we had to try it out. We tried to sing ourselves, but we're such lousy singers that we called for Manuela. - Who was cooking. Would you mind leaving the stove for a while and cook up the song a bit with us? A few days later Camané came to try it out so we ended up with two very good recordings. Camané's voice fit the song great and so did Manuela's. Have you noticed we're living in a kind of “Big Brother”? The camera is always on. There's somebody here filming I don't know why. Everything we say or do. It's for a documentary. I know, I got it. Who's leaving? Let's nominate João Cardoso 'cos he's always barefoot. His feet stink. I will live Just for how long I do not know What does it matter what I'll become I just want to live It's very important to live in the present in a positive way. A song that I sing in a very simple way then moves into a rock arrangement. I really like rock. I like hard rock. I really do, funny. Just as I like hard Fado. What we wanted to achieve on this show has a lot to do with what we tried in the sound. With what ended up working, the entire recording of the album resulting in a specific music personality that is Humanos. Because the 12 songs on the album would make for a very short concert, we had to go look for other songs, more repertoire to build up the concert. That was a fun part of putting it together. We found very enjoyable things, nice duets to do. Mimi frenchy class girl She puts lipstick all over the world I gave her permit for her French service She licks, she sucks, she licks “Que rico”, she licks, she sucks She does it, oh she does it Oh, you got to see her on the streets Believe me, these songs do reach out to people very easily. Nearly all my friends, and I have a lot of them and only one really didn't get the record. And that includes a lot of characters and very different people. Look at the kids, Manuela and Hélder's daughter Nara really likes the songs. It's a 7-to-77 thing. My mother wants to go, and she's 50. My grandmother wants to go. It happened that we had a lot of gigs with Clã after the Humanos album came out, but we were never once asked to do “Change Your Life” or any other Humanos songs. So people can distinguish Clã from Humanos and I'm very pleased with that. That only makes me more curious to find out what kind of an audience will be at the concerts. Two months later Humanos played their first two concerts at the Lisbon Coliseu. Sorry guys but now I'm going to strip completely. Even more? I'll be in here stark naked. You can come now. Go on, go on. I don't believe this. A mother of children doing this! Watch it, we're being filmed. Don't say that. Call Camané so he can sing a fado. Now more people with records. More gold records for us! Gold teeth? We're getting gold teeth today. Your name António Only here is understood Abroad you have never been António Abroad you're always someone else Your name António Is only true over here Why don't you stay here António Over there you're always a foreigner It's probably the one song we worked on most, we recorded the most takes and we spent more time on. We may have spent as many hours on it as in all the other songs combined. But we ended up leaving it off the album because it didn't sound right. I remember us trying to avoid it sounding like a lament. Like somebody pissed off at something, lamenting it. Because António never sounded like that in his songs. He's never nobody's conscience. I remember having that cloud over us and being unable to shrug it off. I think that's why we never really liked the arrangement. We never managed to lose that darker, heavier side. I don't want to be another you Don't ask for a story like yours I don't want to be another you When we got the idea for this new arrangement, it's very simple, based around the voice. But it has a strong intensity and it's very airy it's got a very strong light, it's very luminous. That's what we failed to find when doing the album and now finally got. Your name António António (original demo) Only here is understood Abroad you have never been António Abroad you're always someone else No, the Sun is not to blame If my body gets sunburned Please blame it on my want To hold you in my arms What song on the album do you guys think symbolizes Humanos best? In a radio interview Camané and Rafael said at the same time “Blame It On My Want”. It does have that side, that thing of talking about the need to do things. We should blame all we do in life and all our choices on our own will. Our will to do things, to take risks, to make mistakes, to learn. That's a mark of the song and a good way to symbolise what this project was about as well. The want that lives inside myself The want that dies only when my end Is brought on by my age Please blame it on my want The third Humanos concert took place in the Oporto Coliseu, one week later. You got to get me two more invites for today, two. If not invites then find me a way for these guys to find a seat somewhere. And I'll nag everybody until showtime so I can get two invites for friends. A couple of friends from up North. Don't even think you won't get me the invites. The Web (original demo) This is another one of the demos with António on his own clapping and singing. My first thought was to do it very fast, in a rockabilly way, something like that. But then Rafael came up with a much better idea that changed it around. It was incredible, a great arrangement. And when we heard it all together it sounded incredibly fresh right from the get go. I have a way to persuade you I have the means to hook you up I have a way to persuade you Besides playing the keyboards, João Cardoso plays ukulele on it as well. Something he'd never even picked up and now he's playing it like a virtuoso. Take a good look at me You can't escape You can't escape You won't be able to You won't resist Start smiling You're trapped inside my web I asked for some tickets. There's someone here... And I might just go hoarse, and lose my voice with all the times I've asked for invites for my friends. To give and to receive. I've been asking for two hours, and no, this isn't pointless. Maria Albertina please allow me to say Maria Albertina please allow me to say This is António with the drum machine that helped him write the songs, the faster ones. It was all very confusing because drum machines work with quaternary patterns and he wrote the songs in binary patterns, like folk music. So it all got mixed up and that made it hard for us to arrange them and realise what was it he was after. Maria Albertina please allow me to say Nobody wanted us to do “Maria Albertina”, not even the label. So I made an effort. Defended the song with their help 'cause I wouldn't be able to do it on my own, but it was the arrangement that pulled it off. Maria Albertina How could you have thought Of giving your child the name Vanessa? Rafael got excited too and did this incredible arrangement. Then he just showed up, “look, I've tried this out, no big deal, don't mind the bass...” Then we heard it and it was an unbelievable arrangement, with an unbelievable bass line. So hard to play I took a good week to record it. I know your name doesn't Really sound like much But it's homegrown And full of charm Maria Albertina How could you have thought I'm the husband of Maria Albertina and Vanessa's father. The song that António Variações wrote was a tribute to my wife and daughter. So as a tribute I got this T-shirt and came over to the show. If you'd care to see, this was my wife and my daughter. The glasses of one of the bouncers were the director's. This was also a wonderful magazine. This was Pipi. He was amazing. Camané made one of my favourite gestures, this headshake, just now. Cocky sod! This was so good. So out there. Twenty minutes like a Benfica game. Manuela and David's fast movements. The scissors, the hairdo. This here was very good, oh look, look... So many friends, so many actors, so many movie people you know. You could get a ticket for someone, two for me, for a couple of my friends. With “Guardian Angel” I was very, very happy about the arrangement Hélder and everybody else got together back at the house. Because I like the song a lot but not so much the original version in António's album. And this simpler setting, almost like a lullaby, really brings the song out. I really like singing it and I found out it's also an excellent song to sing children to sleep. He uses a light To light up my life May I have the privilege of complimenting you? You know who I am? I'm António Variações's sister. You are? You do look like him. - I just wanted to meet you. I have no words to thank you. I'm very happy. God bless you all. And if I needed to see the show from the audience because I'm not always onstage singing? I could need to and nobody gets me an invite. I'll tell Salgado (manager). Fado singer Camané sang for the first time in a summer outdoor festival, Sudoeste. It was Humanos' last concert. I know your name doesn't Really sound like much But it's homegrown and full of charm Maria Albertina How could you have thought Of giving your child the name Vanessa? If you'd like to remember me That's up to you If you'd like to repeat me To pair up or even to split I'll be in the well I won't be repressed That's quite dangerous I'll be by myself “In The Mud”, was the first song I was attracted to on this project. When I knew I could do it, I went for it immediately. I remember singing it with a guitar, I hadn't even met them in the studio and was already doing it on my own. Because it has that edge, that strength, that desire for something euphoric. I'll be in that place Of ill repute And I'll feel queer You never filmed the Queen Mother? I filmed the Pope. Which one? John Paul. The one before? - Yes. That's life. And Eusébio, have you filmed Eusébio? Not yet. Not yet? You should make an effort. Are these earthlings waiting for Humanos then? Have you filmed the new Luz stadium, the Cathedral? You have that ambition? I remember having my fly open in the final concert of the Expo 98 and all I could think of was it as going to show on the big screen. Don´t eat me up Don´t eat me up “Don´t Eat Me Up", was one of the hardest for me to sing. In many of António's songs I think of the word “edge”. Because many of them were right there on the edge. What I tried on that song was to try and sing it on the edge. I'm not the mirror of your vanity Nor the pill you take for comfort No, not with me I'm not a TV channel How old are you? - 34. Then I think you may have the chance to at least film another three Popes. Three Popes, with luck, maybe four. That song inspired a lot of people, made a lot of people turn their lives around. She changed her job, changed her husband... This is the new one... Change your life If you're not pleased with how you live Change your life, There's always time to do it Change your life, You shouldn't live upset Change your life If there's enough life throbbing in you Change your life If you're not pleased with how you live Change your life, There's always time to do it Change your life, You shouldn't live upset We had to play around a lot with the platforms because of the differences in height. Funny. I'm the only one who's not in an overall. You're not? No, just in a jacket. All they had was the standard size. The orgasmatron. The face masseur. David was really impressed by the hair scratching device. Really, it messed me up a lot. I had to be really still. It really really gave me the creeps. Didn't you get that feeling too you're watching Joan Collins on TV? I always felt that kind of chill. I did. I still do. Look at this scene. What a lovely embrace. Change your life, There's always time to do it Change your life, You shouldn't live upset Change your life If there's enough life throbbing in you Look, man, I wish you luck on your quest to film King Eusébio. And other great people in our history. Yesterday's and even tomorrow's. Change your life If you're not pleased with how you live The treasure had been discovered and the secret shared. The seven musicians that had sung Variações followed each his own path... ...more HUMAN than before. This is the most beautiful song and I'm the only one who can sing it It is my greatest cry of life It is your cry it is my awakening António Variações Because life is not and Never should be seen As a punishment you have to live through Because life is not and Never should be seen As a punishment you have to live through SLB, SLB. What about my friends' invitation? SLB. The End.
