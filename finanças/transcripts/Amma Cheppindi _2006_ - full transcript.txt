Son, switch off the light and go to sleep. It's 11 p.m. now. - Okay, mother. Not entire thing But not correct. Karthik, drop me. Bloody crook! Sathiraju, drop me at the complex. There are two eggs space empty. Will you adjust in it? You've a car, why do you ask lifts? No need to use car for short distances. Moreover our city's pollution is rising alarmingly For the lift asking man, peddler will cheap. Is my cycle a solution for your pollution? - Move man. Excuse me sir...my eggs.... - Are eggs an hindrance to me? What a nasty smell? Didn't wash the eggs? Today is Saturday. Everyday, I wash eggs and apply talcum powder too. Today, it's very cold, so I didn't wash to trouble them. - Okay. He'll hit us. - No, he'll not. Why risk? Take right, he'll come straight, go... Your Saturday is defiled. Mother... mother... I've come home. You've come son, but what have you done on the way back to home? You've come to me instead of going to the T.V. It means you're up to some mischief. I didn't do anything mother, not even to Sathiraju or Papa Rao. You're not so intelligent is also a blessing in disguise. You can never cheat me. - I'm hungry, mother. It's on the table. Have it. Horlicks or juice today? What's this silly? Will anyone drink hot milk with a straw? Madam Saraswathi! I should pay the penalty, shouldn't I? For others, it's sorry, for Papa Rao, it's money. Madam Saraswathi! - What's this sir? What do you lose? I've got hurt. Madam, I boarded cycle after checking inauspicious time, He came & hit like a rocket. - He didn't. - He did. You know about him, right? Please forgive me if he had done anything. Tell me if you need any help. Is money medicine for my wounds? I'm taking because he lost his cycle & groceries. Bye. Don't shout at Bose, madam. I lost the control on my cycle. ...because of extra luggage You didn't get scared. I thought I got really scared. No, I hate you. You're not getting scared. I'm scared son, but for your hand. Okay, this time you must really get scared. I'll come like a ghost. Why are you so late? Any emergency? Next month Koreans are coming for a satellite launch... We are finalizing their program. Do you've patience to take bath or shall I serve food? No patience I don't have patience to hear Papa Rao's complaints too. Bose, come here. Why does he always do the opposite that I tell him? Leave it, he's a child That's what many doctors have told he'll not grow mentally. Yet, you send him to school. Stop him from going to school. He'll be happy. School will also be happy. If he's alone at home, he'll be sad. Watch my words. This time he'll definitely get promoted. You're also not listening to me. Only this time. Son! Are you sleeping? A little Son, you must study well this time You must pass exam this year. Your father wants to stop you from going to school. I've stopped him this time. Will you keep up my promise? Will you study hard this time? - I'll study, mother. Not now, start tomorrow early morning. What's this son? I warned you many times not to shave yourself. Go to the saloon. I've lot to study, mother. It's waste of time to go to saloon. I don't mind if you get less marks. But I can't see even one cut mark, on your beautiful face, Go to the saloon for a shave. I say I don't have time, why don't you listen to me? Will you go or not? Won't you listen to me? Stupid. Who said you're not clever? Even most powerful heads of the nation bow before him You feel like keep on watching it, right? I can't believe even after seeing it. How could you make it to newspaper? No hair saloon has a specialty which Rocket saloon has. No ordinary customers come here. Every second customer may be a genius. Because this saloon is in India Rocket centre Scientists there build rockets to make India proud in the world. And I play on their heads. ...in the name of message Journalism is downgraded with newspaper publishing your photo. Be careful. Is the newspaper broken? Get me a mirror. Hold it straight. Like offering coconut to monkey, your photo appeared in the paper. Why will they not sir? I'm a star barber. Aren't you a waste star? - Don't write me off easily. I've been a barber to scientists since Vikram Sarabhai's time. Their brains don't work unless I handle their heads once a month Take for instance Abdul Kalam He never allows anyone else other than me to act his hair. That's why he's sporting long hair after going out from here He escaped from you and is now the President of India. That's it! I've always worked on history making brains. Here comes the real history making brain. A brain that will re-write history. - Fast...fast...fast.... Getting ready so early in the morning? Going to see any bride? Keep quite sir. Always pulling Bose's legs. Please pay now. - Money brings to me memory. Shall we have a bet, Bose? If you win I'll pay for your shave. If I win you pay for my haircut. Okay. What should I do? Using your genius brain, answer my question. A salesman's wife got pregnant after many years of marriage, He went to an astrologer to know if it was son or daughter. Astrologer drops a bombshell that child's father will die on birth. Papa Rao, come this side and narrate it. The husband asks his wife to abort the child Wife says she's a chaste woman and nothing will happen to him. Though she assures him safety, husband is damn scared. Even at the time of delivery, husband hides in the home. Just then he gets a call from the hospital, His wife delivers a son, but father doesn't die. But his neighbour dies eating his breakfast Now tell me, why didn't the salesman die? Astrologer played a joke on him. He's not a fake, he was a genuine astrologer. Because wife was a chaste woman, If she was a chaste woman, why will I ask you this riddle? Shall I give you a hint? Why did the man-next door die? His breakfast was poisoned. - Your brain is poisoned. Don't think too much. I've brought new oil to make your brain sharp. Rs.100 The one you brought last time didn't work. That was green color. The power didn't match you. This is very powerful. Blue oil. The oil will seep direct into brain and you'll become a scientist. I'll become a statue. Before you answer my riddle. You lost, so pay for my hair cut. I've lot of work. It seems there's a function in your place tonight. To celebrate your daughter getting pregnant Are you a tom-tom? Reduce your voice. Why? Your daughter is married, isn't she? Not that, he'll come first to the party uninvited if he hears you You lost this month by mistake, you'll win next time. Let's meet next month. No. Let's meet today evening. Durga sister has invited me to the party. IST Head Quarters, Islamabad Suddenly they want friendship... bloody friendship. Did we sacrifice so many lives all these years for nothing? We must strike India before this friendship disease spreads. Where's Ayub? I want one more glass...l want... Bose, take sweets. - What? - Sweet. I don't want sister. I'm busy now. - Have one & play. These two glasses are mine. One who stamps it first is the winner I won because I stamped first. - Hey! Why are playing with kids? When will you grow up? You spoiled costly glasses. Join group of your age. Go & tell. It's used glasses, isn't it? - Is it cheap? It's Rs.75 for 100. Are you planning to clean and resell it to the shopkeeper? Will I throw it then? Yes...when? - Mother, let's go home. Isn't it nice on me? - No, you look 10 years younger. Don't study too much son. You must enjoy fun in the party, go & play. Toast to would be father. Not only that would be... - Would be? I forgot. We got permission for our frontier tex school. This will be world's first school. May be the syllabus will be very high for 12th passed students. May be for ordinary students, not for the geniuses we are going to select When are you opening the college? - August 15th. This year's Independence Day is very special to our centre Nation's top scientists will be here. As visiting faculty. Will it be ready in this short period of time? Why will it not be ready? I've chosen the best young brain who can achieve impossible. It's like a lorry from far and a rocket from near. Independence Day float Yes, I'm personally supervising it. GSLV is our centre's pride. - Ours is the best Rocket centre. How'll it reach Delhi? - In a truck. Rocket on road Bose, come with me. - It'll be ready by July. It'll take at least 10 days for this sized rocket to reach Delhi. Why are you trying to behave like a man? We don't need those Astrophysics? Come, let's play medley of songs. Come on children. Let's play medley of songs. Why are you playing with him? Leaving other guests. What's there to talk with them? Their husbands talk about rockets and wives talk about jackets. They'll never change whether in space or America. Come children, let's go & play. - Come... come. He doesn't listen because he's not intelligent. She doesn't listen to me because she's over intelligent. Not only her, no one will listen to you. A party is going on in a scientist's home. These are the clips I captured there. Top scientists of the country will come to BRC on August 15th They'll not return from there. Let's blow up BRC and bury the Indian science Today I'll go to school in car. - Why? I can study on the way. Good idea! But car has gone to the station. - Why? Chandu is coming. He hasn't come yet. Will the train arrive as you think? Why did you send a car? You should've sent cycle. To station? How will be bring the luggage? Carry on his head? Stupid Sir, I've carried the luggage so far will you my porter charges? What's this son? Leave him. As if you're short. What's this make over? I expected you to be student no:1, but you're became coolie no:1 For your well built body, taking off this shirt. What did you bring for me? Dirty clothes, I'm coming from hostel not from a holiday. I must go now, I'm getting late to the school. You're growing in height fast, can't you put on little weight? Look here. Why are you running wild like a blind buffalo? Poor boy! He didn't see you. Sorry sister. I must go home urgently. To toilet? - No, to study. Sister, I can't come to play with you till I finish my exams. Study well. How is your son? Fine, he said hello to you. Why do you befriend him? Have you gone mad? Why are you so harsh on him? Bose is a very good boy. He's without any impurities like an innocent child. His company is much better than other hypocrites. No misunderstandings, no double meanings. He's a black mark to this entire township. I can't stand idiots Were you intelligent immediately on birth? If your mother had been just like you, Can't take bath, can't eat food, don't know to stay clean, With such complaints she would've left you. Will you stay here only? I came today only. Will you send me back to hostel today itself? Stay here only but don't disturb me. I've exams. Are you serious this time - Very serious. Can I use your bathroom, boss? You can but flush out after using it. Do you understand all this? A little bit. This isn't mine, it's for under graduates. How clever you are! Do you know even my text books are very difficult? It might be easy to you, as you would've studied it. I studied but I feel it is difficult than what I studied. Really? In fact there are few... Father! Have you finished your exams? - Finished. Results will not be announced now. Do I've to wait till the results are announced? Even you don't have to wait for this results. You'll get a zero. Mother come Still not yet ready? Come quickly. Why are you in a hurry? - I'll get my report card today. Sorry son, I forgot. - So, come quickly. If you help me, I can get ready in 5 minutes. If you don't, I can get ready in a minute Why don't you look at him when he's going to get his report? Any letters for me? Why does Chandu only get the letters? Why not me? He applies to many universities, they are application forms. I've applied on-line. These are residence mailers & student loan forms. Mother! I'll also get letters from America and Japan. Mother, I got my SAT score. - Show me. I expected it so I didn't browse results in the net also. 2400? Teachers will also get confused if it is so big. You come, mother. Greetings madam. Principal wanted you to meet him. Bose, you wait here only. I'm getting my marks. Bhairava! How many marks did you score? How much did you score? I'm getting the class first, so Principal is giving it to my mother. Really? It's not his mistake. Can anyone grow taller with sincere efforts? This is also like that only. You know well his mental growth stopped at age seven, No use in keeping him in school anymore. There are special schools for special kids like him. We don't have such facility here, so I kept him in my school. May be next year he'll improve? He has no past or future. For him everything is present. In a way, he's very lucky boy. For us time is flowing river. For him time is a pond. It'll never change. He can play, sing and dance in it. It's not justified to arrest such a free spirited soul in school. Lotus will bloom only in a pond. There's nothing he can achieve here. Except feeling sad when other children pass out leaving him behind Give him little responsibilities or else leave him freely. Come son, let's go home. My report card! Show it to me. Let's go home first. - Show me first. I said only after going home, right? I studied very hard, mother. Greetings Major! - Greetings madam. I came to meet Bose. How is he? He doesn't go out. All his friends will be in school. No problem, madam Anyway school will be closed in a week for holidays. He'll forget everything playing with them. Keep flying always. If you don't study, I'll remove you from school. If you find any job for Bose... - Madam, a letter. He wrote a letter to himself seeing Chandu getting all the letters. This letter is from Suzuki company, Japan. Please join our company. Please come with Batman's dress while reporting for duty. If you don't bring it, you'll not get the job. See how subtly he told his preferred birthday gift. Sometimes, I get a doubt... ...that he may be a genius in disguise Whatever disguise it may be! He's a wonderful kid. No, frooti to you What? - Wish me. Goodnight - Today is my happy birthday. Oh! Wish you a happy birth night. Mother!- Why didn't you wake me up, son? Chandu is at home. So, I gave him the chance. To wish me first. I'm wishing you second, happy birthday, my dear son. My new clothes. - After oil bath. Not before 6 am It comes once every year. My heart greets you always... You live long for a thousand years... This is my wish. Are you finished son? - Finished. Taking off my clothes. Mother, sing this song for me. You are singing it fine. But I don't know the meaning. Sing it in Telugu. How long will you take bath, till the translation is over? No, you sing & I'll take bath. If you don't sing, I'll not take bath. How can you hear me, if the door is closed? I'll keep the door a little open. As a mother I wish... I'm singing hat I wish as song... I ant to celebrate your birthday for 100 years... What's this? Birthday dress or fancy dress? He's wishing it for a year no. I got your father's friend bring it from America. So, Boseman will become Batman. Why do you call him by name? Can't you call him as brother? He's 4 years older to you. He may be elder, but mentally he's 10 years younger to me. If I call him as elder brother, it'll be like teasing him. I don't know but your reasoning seems valid. But I can't judge whether it's taunt or affection. Leaving so early? I've to.... A delegation from Europe has come. I've to receive them. One minutes. Today is Bose's birthday. Wish him & go. I'll get late, please wish him on my behalf also. Son, your father is wishing you. Thank you father Bose, it's not compulsory to appear in birthday suit on birthday. Not feeling sorry for second interruption also Mother, song In a sorry free world, if time stops moving... If you shine bright like moon without waning or waxing... I dream everyday to see your innocent pure smile... Stars bless you... mother's blessings... I wish you to celebrate your birthday a 1000 years... Brother, a gift for you I'll cut the cake now. - So early in the morning? Yes, I'll have cake for breakfast not the regular idly. Are you cutting cakes of an entire bakery? No, I'm 21 years. So, 21 cakes. Mr. Batman! I think you're confused between cakes & candles. It must be 21 candles. But, he can't eat candles, can he? Logic is correct but your mathematics is wrong. There are only 20 cakes. - I know it. Hidden unexpected gifts for you... Life will present it to you at twists & turns... You're my life's greatest gift... What gift can I give you, my son? Other than wishing good for you... Where is Sathiraju? He's serving the delegates. Don't disturb him. - Okay. Ho did you enter the premises? Security people are my friends. - Idiots, I must fire them. Leave it, Navin. Today is his birthday. I invited Bose. Come. Why did you come here? - For the cake. Didn't I promise to bring it? I got late because of delegates. Bingo! Mother bought it for me. Why are you wearing a bat's dress on birthday? This is Batman's dress, This is Chandu's gift. My brother is the greatest. Good! Indeed your brother is great. Whenever you ear it, you're taking him on a procession... What's wrong in it? My brother is really the greats. Here's your rocket cake. Even Sathiraju isn't free to offer me a gift. Let's hide there. Look Batman. - He's our Bose, not batman. Is it dream, reality or illusion? He hit me hen I as in a bicycle. No, I'm riding a four heeler. He'll not miss me. He'll surely turn-right. Then after taking turns come here again. I'll go straight. Why didn't you come to Bose's birthday party? He gave me a return gift. He gave me without attending his party. What hit your face? - Cake. I heard about Sunstrokes, first time I'm seeing cake stroke. Come, I'll give you a lift. - For another gift? I don't want now. Do you know what he did today? He entered delegates dining area and created... Please don't scold him today. It's his birthday. I think it's good to admit Bose in some institution... What are you saying? Will you send him to a mental asylum? Not a mental asylum. Please think with cool mind. There are many facilities to look after special people. We know only one. Doctors there would've seen 100's of people like him. He'll be under the observation all the 24 hours. They'll design a treatment that they deem fit for him. He's not a lab specimen. He's not a cell under a microscope. Your son. Find him a job. No one else can do it as sincerely as him. Don't tell me anything. Mother Haven't you slept yet? I'll work, mother. I'll work hard and become a great scientists like dad. I can became a scientist if I work hard without studying right, mother? You can become whatever you wish, my dear son. I've got a job you know that? I'm a BRC employee now. Stop. Toy! - Take out all the stuff yourself. Then, you can't take it inside. No, I'll take it inside. Stop. You're a VlP now. No need to pass through it. Welcome Bose. New dress for a new job. Have I become an adult now? Almost! If you settle in a job, you can marry too. Take these coupons and supply them what they ask. They all do the same job. It's the same all the day. That's as simple. If I get the maximum coupons, will I get a prize? Give me the list. - Who is h e? Tempo driver Tempo goes to Sullurupet for groceries twice every week. Pick me up from here after loading materials. Don't go so speed in the turnings. Go right...

Why are you getting innocence? You're wrong. He's a nice boy. Come. Did you get hurt? I didn't do anything. I know, I've seen you here a couple of times. I'm a supplier and service provider for video games in this area. Are you in video business? If there's good margin of profit any business is my business. Different kinds of people come here. If you're so interested, come to my office & play. There are a couple of machines. Nobody will disturb you. You can play as long as you like. Without using coins. - Really? Really true Stop. What's this vehicle? Why are you driving it? Tempo... I've got it as part of my job package. But he said police will catch me if I drive. Who'll dare to catch you when I'm here? Why are you going in a tempo wearing uniform? You should travel majestically on a bullet. Sorry, in haste I suggested a wrong thing I've urgent work. A moped lifter has come this way, I must catch him. Only 3 rounds, don't go beyond this road. Go side way immediately... go... go. Put the stand. He's gone. Oh my God! What? - Don't talk. Gone? - He's going. He's coming again. I think he's suspecting us. - No. If he comes again, let's escape I think it's an accident. I didn't get hurt. I jumped a little early. I too didn't get hurt. Got hurt? - Why are you coming so fast? How dare to run over small vehicles riding such huge vehicles? Why are you still inside. Come out of the vehicle. Just mouths! Are you all blind? Who came the wrong side? - Oh Lady driver! You've eyes. - Shell out money first. It's safe to keep your hands off me. If you don't pay, watch what we'll do to your car. We'll break it into pieces.

Did anyone get hurt? - No they ran away. I'll catch them. Nephew! Why did you take so much time? Good! You got the moped. Where are the thieves? If I had a gun, I would've caught them. If I had given you my gun, I would've lost my job. If you don't finish this work tomorrow, no games period for you. You should stay in class... Police!- It's Bose. If you give too much of home work, I'll arrest you If you don't go out, I'll make sit in the corner. So, all of you take your note books. You can't punish me. I'm an employee now. Let's sit here.

I'll see it later. You go home now. Class is near the temple. Near the temple? Will the lessons be devotional hymns? Music doesn't need a black board. Keyboard is enough. Does anyone know music? No. - I asked do you know? Bose is good in music. Yes, he can sing anything, even lessons. - What? But, poor boy, he can't write it in exams. He sang entire telephone directory once. He sang entire first page of a newspaper. He sang once the attendance register from A to Z. Once he threw my pencil, Did he sing with brand names? No, he threw away my pencil. I can believe this but I can't believe what you said earlier. Where is he? I failed even after applying this blue oil. They removed me from the school.

Your heartbeat is also song... Feeding a child with love & care is a sweet song... First lessons in the school is a song... Song will sing a hammock... Song will wake up God... If you befriend music... Your entire life will be a song... Tempo is here. Bose, tempo has come. What's the stock you're taking? - Sugar. I'll come tomorrow. No way! I can't come so far everything. After dropping you here, loading sugar in the market, and coming back to pick you up. I'm getting delayed. Do you use high quantities sugar? - Good quantity. How much do you buy every week?

Did he dream that you'll be in home at this time? Why do you always chide him? Learn to appreciate him also at times. If he hits like this, it's difficult to appreciate. If you like it's not difficult There're many things that can be appreciated. Canteen contractor has been supplying sugar for many years. He got supplies at lesser price by Rs.1 .50. Within a month's duty at canteen... He has saved a lot of money for your canteen. Isn't it his intelligence? How did you get it at cheaper price? My friend owns a sugar mill.

I too wanted to present you a gift. They gave a remote control car, thank you. It's for kids. You're a man now. I must present you a big gift. You helped me a lot in sugar business. I earned huge profits in the last 2 months. So, I'm presenting you a Maruti car. Really? - Truly true. Red Maruti car outside is yours. Vacate the place in 10 minutes.

Mr. Bose, you're selected for scientist course in All American University, While coming here you've to bring 10 tins of cream biscuits. From Principal American University Poor boy! Seeing you getting all the admission letters. He has written a letter to himself. See how he longs to go to America. Poor boy! I'll definitely send him to America one day. Long live, Venku Reddy, Long live our leader Venku Reddy. Janardhan, what's that processions. Venku Reddy is filing nomination. Procession by his supporters, I think it's better to take the side road. Okay, reverse the car, boy move... Call Chennai. Tell Masood to block 3 tickets to Dubai. Auto! Move... There's no end to your madness, Bose. Why did you come on this road in a car? It'll be a traffic jam all afternoon. For filing nomination he's such a pain. Don't know how much he'll torture people if he wins the election? Don't you've brain! If you blow horn, will the traffic clear? Bose, do one thing There's a one way street opposite side, go through it. Mid way the road will have potholes. But if you go straight you'll hit the high way. Don't go anywhere else. I'll call you exactly after an hour. If you're not in home, I'll rip your skin out. 150 killed in a car bomb explosion. Police suspect the hand of dreaded ISI terrorist Riyaz Khan. Raise the volume. Let's see if the news is real. Move forward... Rickshaw move forward... You move that side... You come. You go back. Come... come... Go... go... come... come. Bose, I'll call you in an hour. I think it's a junk car. That's why you got it as a gift. Come, let's stop a passing bus. There'll be an accident if the car is on the road. Let's push it sideway. We should've waited near the jeep. Enough Let's park it in that house. - Should we push it further? If we leave it on road, somebody may steal it. They stole moped also like this. Let's keep it inside, please boys. It should start first for anyone to steal it. Why so high volume? - To listen our car bomb blast news. Have I arranged any live show for your names to come on TV? Reduce the volume. Go & see. Why is he here instead of city? We gave him a car, why is he walking to home? Idiots! Car will be somewhere here only. It seems Bose has been arrested. Will he be in jail all his life? They're not police but lB officials. - You mean... Intelligence Bureau...secret agents How well she acted as a music teacher? Will they take Bose to some secret place? No, they are in our Rohini Guesthouse. Will they beat Bose? Don't you remember anything? Did you hear them talk about bombs in these 4 months? Did they ask you anything about this centre? Say like where's the mission control? Where's the umbilical tower? Where's the computer room? Leave him... Bose, you go home. You haven't committed any mistake. It was just an accident, right? One more thing, don't go out. Don't go out of this Rocket centre. They used Bose as a courier. the information he provided... Don't talk about him like that. I see an insider's hand also along with ISI. I've no doubt about it. My doubt is whether they have smuggled something in or taken out? Or both? If anything has come inside It's that thing only. Call the bomb squad. Bose has spoilt this township. It's sniffer dogs all over the place. You don't come to my home, may be you'll plant a bomb here. In which team I'm in. Not any team, my father asked me not to play with you. You're a dangerous man. Eat this. Don't touch my Hawker? Trying to poison it. Mother. - What happened son? What have I done? Why everyone is scolding me? It wasn't your mistake. You haven't done anything. Not only now everyone chides or laugh at me. Elders say I'm a kid. Kids say I'm a man. Nobody likes me. I don't know it. Why am I like this? Why am I not like everyone else? Tell me mother. Let anyone say anything, don't care it... You're a mother's favorite son... In sunshine or rains... I'm your umbrella... The world will watch with awe every step you put forward... Bose, your mother is here... What's use in having 10 heads? When your thoughts are demonic... There is no use of words son... If you are a saint... wipe your tears, son... It'll wipe your smiles... Know this my son... You're the best in this world... Though your brain is small, you've a great appetite for food. I'm innocent. I didn't do anything. A bird with it's wings can't fly long distance... But a man ho can never fly will reach stars... The belief you've on your mother will take you to... And place in the sky like the pole star... Any information from the mikes fitted in scientists house? Not yet, the recordings of their chats is running into several hours We are running behind schedule by at least 3 or 4 days in hearing it. You can't avoid though it may take ages. Keep monitoring it. - Okay. Come quickly. We've to go to a place. Come later, I've work now. I came later, come with me. - Not now, come after an hour. It's time. I told you not to irritate me, get out from here. What's this Bose? Today is your birthday. Forgot it? - How do you know it? You wrote it in my slam book. Cakes are cut with knives not with guns. Stop... stop. - Mouth organ? As a mother I wish... I'm singing what I wish as song... I want to celebrate your birthday for a 100 year... Happy birthday to you my little Razia! It's many years since I celebrated my birthday. You forgot it. - I forgot. I'm getting late. Mother will be waiting for me. Do you think I'll go away? Without giving you a gift. No...no...you shouldn't open it now. Open it after many more days. Where did you get so much money? I saved all my salary. Why did you spend it on me? You should've kept it for yourself. I don't need money. I've mother & father. You don't have anyone. It's dogs and bomb squads all over the place. How can we work? When will you taken them out? They'll be here only. Tomorrow another squad is arriving. RD X has come into this centre. We have to keep searching till we find it. In 4 days FTI is getting opened here. India's top scientists will be here. That's why we've to be more careful. Despite all your search you didn't find RD X here. May be it is not inside the centre? May be it has gone out. How? We designed an Independence float here. It left from here a week ago. Is Prime Minister their target? It wouldn't have reached Delhi yet. Check UP & M.P borders You missed and landed up as a scientist here. If you'd joined IB, you'd be the chief of IB now. I'm not a competitor to you, am I? You're sending me to IB. Why did you come here? Have you gone mad? Why did you get the float seized? These dogs will not more out from here, unless I throw that biscuit. Though hidden 15 feet under the stage, how long can it go unnoticed? Further delay would've jeopardized our original plan. I did the right thing, didn't I? If everything goes on as planned Only then you'll become the head of Pakistan missile project. What about security? Breached. Yadav will add delayed action sedative to security people's breakfast. They'll faint once Scientists enter the Research centre. Nobody will get any doubt. Yadav will close the Research Centre door and cut all the phone lines. I'll plant the bomb under the Independence Day flag mast. It'll blow up in 30 minutes after activation. If anyone catches the flag, it'll blow up in a minute. Nothing will be remain within 150 yards. Every thing will be reduced to ashes. I'll come to you an hour before with the computer hard disc. You've a bright future. Right hand of Bharat Rocket centre Mother bye You asked me to make fries, where are you going out? Be careful, it's hot. Why are you rushing? Bhairava and Jatin are waiting for me in the club. They've become my friends again. At least change your dirty shirt. - I'll change tomorrow. You'll never change. Why did you come back like a ball hit on the wall? I want to stay in home. Are you waiting for anyone? - No. Mad boy! You can never cheat your mother. Greetings aunty Come in & sit. I'll get a tea for you. No, I'll make... Can I come in? Come in. Get a chair. Have you finished your investigation successfully? I'll give you. I took 2 and gave you 3. You're getting intelligent. Whatever it is your son has become an adventurous Hero. I'll get you a juice. By sheer luck nobody got hurt. Otherwise everybody would've accused him. Still they hate him. What if anything disaster had happened? I shudder even to imagine it. No more tensions. We found the bombs. No more tensions for you Bose. No more questions. Sleep happily. What happened? - Game blacked out. Why are you repeating the same words? It's a song, I'm practicing it. - Song? - Yes. You go, I'll repair the game. He's bringing the tapes. They would've encrypted and sent it Morse code Decode it immediately. Not tomorrow or day after. Yesterday is also late. I want a day before yesterday. We got a lucky break because of boy with wonderful super memory. Don't miss the chance break. I'm not unable to decide friend. Shall I become a scientist or lB officer? What shall I become? Only idle people will try to become someone. You're unparalleled. You mean? It means you are special and there's no one else like you. Shall we go out for a dinner again? As soon as I complete this investigation I think we are running out of time. No, may be luck is favoring us, Niranjan is rushing towards us. We broke the code given by Bose. They have another plan also other than that float. I don't know what's the plan but their leaders name is Ayub. We got an address in Chennai also. Where's Ayub? - Who are you? Where is Ayub? - Who is Ayub? Masood knows it. Masood Travels. Triplicane High road. Closed. - You too. 4 batches went without any hitch. Recently...idiots What's it? What are you doing? Okay? Why are you checking drawers? Who are you guys? Am I fool to believe whatever you say? Sit silently please. We've work to do. Are you crazy? You don't know about me. I'll call police and see your end. Tickets are in many shapes here. All for very long distance. - Shall we book him? Where is Ayub? - Who? Where is Ayub? - I don't know. Look Masood, you can say it happily. Or say it with great difficulty. I'll leave it on your choice. But you can't avoid saying it. I don't know. Play with him. Dozed off? - No. Did you check all outgoing flights? I've checked. No booking on Ayub's name. I wish FTI will become a world-renowned learning centre. We've been honored to have eminent scientists in our amidst. Their guest lectures will inspire students here and, I strongly believe that it'll make them eminent scientists of the future. 879523 students nationwide had applied for seats. Only 22 among them got the seats. These are those elite 22 students. I'm proud to announce that 2 of them belong to BRC. One is Chandu, Our Director Bharadwaja's son. Mother toilet I'm even more proud to introduce the second student. Venkat, our BRC Town Barber's son I thank Dr. Bharadwaja for giving me the opportunity to hoist the flag. Now our guest scientists BRC senior scientists, first batch of students, Will gather inside for an hour's orientation program. I request all other guests to join in the lunch again. It's over son. I'm felling giddy, I'll visit the clinic & come. Why are you taking papads first? It will become soft. Nothing is yet ready. By noon everything will be ready, madam. Come, I'll show you a new dish. - New dish? Go home now and come at noon for lunch wearing nice dress. Why? This is nice dress. An Independence hero's dress. So, people will laugh at you if you wear his dress always. Change your dress. What happened to you, Nagaraju? Keep watch, I'll take him to quarters. Something fishy is happening. Inform head quarters immediately. I'll take the scientists to safer place. I'm going to Chennai Airport. Wait for my phone call. I'll tell you only one work, O.K. That's all, switch on the bomb and leave. He's not uttering a word despite every thing we did. We've to take him to the department. That's the best. - I'll book his ticket. Running short of breath. Don't be afraid. You'll need 4 minutes to die breathless. This hasn't got so much time. Feel like talking. Throw up. Shall we give the last shock? Make the phone call. Throw the phone. You can't stop. What's going to happen? You're finished. Finished. He called a phone number in the Rocket centre. Don't know what these buggers have done there? Let's go to Rocket centre. It'll take at least 45 minutes even if we go in a helicopter. No time Recording of the plan in Qureishi's house 3 days earlier They've planted a bomb. It has been activated by the phone call. I'm not able to get conference call to Dr. Bharadwaja. Okay, listen carefully. We've just 30 minutes only. Under the national flag... Bomb... - Bomb... It seems a bomb has been planted in the Research Centre. My son Venkat is there only. Bomb! Don't know what will happen to him? No napkins too Terrorists have planted a bomb in the research centre. I brought chain & lock. Lock the gates and don't allow anyone inside. What should we do now? Keep children away from this place, go. Will the bomb squad come? Bomb will blow up in 25 minutes. Stop... stop... Principal ordered not to allow anyone in. Please stay here only Papa Rao you too My son-in-law. - Where are you going? Please sit, let's think Sit please. - Are you saying the truth? My son-in-law is inside. I'm telling you, Why are you pushing inside? You too. Don't get scared. Major sir! My son is inside Please save him. My only son! I toiled hard to get him through school. Sit here...sit here... Stop... stop.. Why are you rushing inside? What'll you do going aside? Why are you rushing in? Bomb is under the flag. It'll blow in 25 minutes. If you touch it, it'll blow in a minute. If you don't panic and think We may be able to save our scientists & students inside. Or else we'll die. 150 yards from here will be reduced to ashes. Can't we save the scientists locked up inside? They locked the doors and cut the power cables. Let's break open this walls. Those are high society walls. It'll take hours to reach inside. Can't we defuse the bomb? Bomb squad has left in a helicopter. It'll take more than 30 minutes. Can we talk to people inside? Landlines have been snapped. Cell phones are not allowed inside. Isn't there any way to save lives of people inside? Should we be mere spectators watching them die? There's only one-way. Somebody should carry this flag and run 150 yards away from there. So, the carrier will... What if we carry little distance and throw it? It will be at least 20 kgs. you can't throw it far away. I'll go. Tirupathi, stop. - Don't stop me. Don't stop me... - Dear, please stop. Let me go, I must save my son. What's this? Please stop. All my hopes and dreams are on him. I toiled all my life for his bright future only. Without him my life is not worth living. What is this madness? We've two teenaged daughters. What'll you do with them? If you get panic like this, you'll lose the little time also. This is a nefarious act by Pakistan. There's no other way to save our scientists & students. Can anyone sacrifice life to save this Rocket centre & our motherland? You heard Principal, right? Can anyone step forward? It'll blow up in 10 minutes. If you don't get angry, I'll make a suggestion. Anyone taking the flag will be a disaster. Future will go kaput. It's a grave sin to put price on life. But if Bose does it. There won't be much loss. Bloody stingy fellow. Counting here also. Don't say like that. Will I be so inhuman at such times also? My daughter is pregnant, my son-in-law's life is in danger. I may be any type of man, if I could run fast, I would've gone. You can understand. I'm right, if you think over it again. Anyway we are in this fix because of Bose. It's justified that he must go. Why are you talking like this? Did he do it wantonly? He always considered every home has as his own and behaved like that. He did everything you told him. Though you don't respect him for his age, though you heckled him. he was always with you. Why so much of hatred for an innocent soul like him? Madam think Keep aside your anger and emotions. People inside aren't just our relatives, Your husband, a man this country can't lose. Your younger son, who can emulate his father. In a way only Bose can do it. Any brave man knowing about certain death will hesitate. Trust me. I saw many battlefields. Even brave soldiers in war march ahead in blind faith. Soldiers accompanying give them courage & protection. You don't have anything like that here. Thinking about running himself to death He may get scared and run away leaving the flag, Not only himself, every man inside will also perish away. Bose doesn't know the danger so he'll not get afraid or hesitant. May be he was born for this day. Not only then, think like this Thought it's unjustified or very sad, If they die, the entire township's sorrow will be all yours. They will consider Bose is the reason for the disaster. All his life they'll blame him. Can you see it? Mother, do you know what had happened? You got a seat in America you've to join immediately. Did I tell you, mother that I'll study in America? You thought I was mad, right? No time, we must leave immediately in the flight. On the way you must take the flag from research centre and run fast. Why flag? We must tell the Americans that we are from India, right? We must take it. Mother! Is the Principal really sending me to America? Really. - Do I've to take the flag also? You have to. Why are you so sad? I'm worried about you leaving me. Then, I'll not go. No, you have to go. I'll not leave my mother & go. You must go for your mother's sake. Son! Go for my sake. Poor boy! This is injustice. Mother, pack my Batman & Superman dress. I'll send it later. Go just like that. You're getting late, come quickly. - Okay. Remove it quickly. Okay Bose, flight is waiting. Take the flag and run fast to the airport. Take the short cut route near the lake. You're my best friends. I know I'm not your best friend. But still you're my best friends Take all my toys. You tried a lot to improve my brain. What? I always massaged your head. Today I must fall at your feet in reverence Sorry, I need to pay a lot for your car. I'll ask my mother to pay for it. I'm indebted to you eternally. Enough. Take my cycle. I broke your cycle. Palanquins carry only gods, they are not for ordinary mortals. Sister Durga, bye In few days I would've met my nephew also, right? He's not just nephew, his name is Bose. I'll name him after you. Mother Mother! I'm not going to America, right? I know it. There is a bomb, right? I know it. But I'll go for you. If I do like this nobody will ever scold me, right? I know it. You cried many times hiding from me. Because I'm not normal. So, if I do anything really big, you'll like it. Chandu was praised for scoring high marks. Like that everyone will praise me also, right? Mother, I feel like seeing you once again. You're the greatest mother. I love you, mother. Mother, will it be painful? Son, go for your mother's sake. Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people, dispenser of India's destiny thy name rouses the hearts of Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat, the Maratha country, in the Dravida country, Utkala and Bengal; It echoes in the hills of the Vindhyas and Himalayas, it mingles in the rhapsodies of the pure waters Jamuna and the Ganges. Thy chant only thy name, thy seek only thy blessings, Thy sing only thy praise. The saving of all people waits in thy hand, thou dispenser of India's destiny Victory, Victory, Victory, Victory to thee Whatever you say about such great man is my little. In fact we are unfit to talk about him. He did what we all couldn't do. An uneducated man has served this nation which no scientist ever did. A boy has bravely done what no soldier could do for this country. Such great men come once in an era Bose is immortal. Let's maintain 2 minute silence. I've to say something. Many people talked many things about Bose. Praised him. But he was much greater than what you've imagined. Though he has taken a risk. You think that he had taken this risk in ignorance. I'll tell you something now which nobody here knows. Bose is such a person. Who will be the first to help if there's an accident. So, after calling Principal, I made another call also. To Bose There's a bomb, it'll blow up if you touch it. I took a promise from him not to leave home, did he do it knowingly... I never expected you'll cheat a mother. But you did cheat your mother. Elder brother! Let's remain silence for 2 minutes for the departed soul. A bird with it's wings can't fly long distances... But a man who can never fly will reach stars... The belief you've on your mother will bake you... I'll marry you after I grow up. And place you in the sky like t he pole star...
