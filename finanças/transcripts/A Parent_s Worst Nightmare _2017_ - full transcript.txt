Tap out, tap out! Bit in the head. Get it, three, two, one, go. Freeze now! Hey, let me see your hands! On the ground, on the ground, on your faces right now! Tex, Biggs! What you got, what you be still fighting, huh? Get down! We're not with him! We don't even know him! They just hired us, they just hired us for some stupid dance wrestling. Sir, just let us go. We just met them today, I swear. Get your stuff and get out. Keep your hands right up there, boy! Get out! - Tex. - One locked door. All right listen up in there! You do not wanna take a shot at me. I am heavily armed and I will turn this place into the O.K. Corral! Speak up! I got a nine, I'm putting it down. Hands, hands, hands! Behind your neck. Behind your neck, behind your neck. Take him to the front with the others. Should I call Detroit PD, sir? No, not yet. I know a woman in the suburbs who runs a no kill shelter. Get the dogs out of here first then we call PD. Hoo rah. Get his ass up. You stole a dog. A rich man's dog. Rich men don't like having their dog stolen. Paid us good money to track you down. I'll give it back. Yeah you will. You definitely will. But there's a price you gotta pay. See I don't like dog fighters. You like dog fighters, Tex? I do not. Biggs, hold my weapon. Just so you can never say that I sucker punched you. I'm about to beat your ass. Come on, Cap. Showed him that. Just like I taught him when he was a boy. Yeah just like you taught me, sir. Listen, I want the names and addresses of every single dog fighter in every house in this city. You're not a cop. Oh no. Tex, we got any coke in the car? - A whole lot of it. - Yeah, bring it in. Bring in enough for a life sentence. Ooh, let's get some horses in the background. Oh my gosh, we have to have the horse in the background. The horse in this one. - Cheese. - Yes! That was perfect. Keep it balanced. Very good, very good. Smile, birthday girl. Yeah, you wanna look good for your boyfriend. Bombshell shot. Stop, he's not my boyfriend. I've never even met him. Love at first sight. Don't worry, Joanna, I'll have her home by six. Promise. Not worried at all, I'm just glad you could take the girls to the stables. I think she's a natural. Allison's been wanting that for years. So, how goes the surprise party planning? Well, since you were able to get them out of the house, I was able to make some calls. It's gonna be fun. Okay, I'll see you in a bit. Time to dehorse your daughter. bye. Great job, Allison. Sarah, you're up. He's a hottie. Cheating on Tyler already. I'm turning 16 tomorrow so I'm not gonna be this young forever. Afternoon, John. Maggie. How'd it go, Captain? Everybody gather around the table. Aaron, you joining us? No. All right, Detroit PD called every single one of those animal abusers. Well done, team. Hey Captain, don't forget. You bird dogged those losers for six weeks now. We all thought it was gonna be a dead end, remember? Sixth sense, I was thinking like a dog. All right, I also hooked Detroit PD into two other dog rings, both local. Okay, all the names, phone numbers, addresses, everything. So that's big, well done, guys. All right. And, our employer gave us a nice fat tip so it's steak dinners on me. Hey, you want me to do the drive to Cleveland tomorrow on that Simpson matter? Now that the dog case is closed and all? I can handle it, John. I don't mean any disrespect. Well it is disrespectful. But my case is closed. So you think you should take my case? I think there's a missing boy and I'm available. John, I can handle it. That's why I hired you, Karen. Tex, you'll get lead on another case real soon. Hey, you give the orders, I just follow. What are we at now, 90 hours? 96. Aaron, how we doing? Hey yo pencil neck, the lady's talking to you. Oh that's hysterical. You must be the funniest guy in your GED program. Boy, I'm educated in all kind of stuff that you don't know nothin' about. Anything about. Obviously English is not one of your strong suits. Well I tell you what, I'm educated in Greco-Roman wrestling and western boxing. So how you like that, chump? Boys, I don't want any of that in this office, do you hear me? It leads to arguing. Arguing leads to cussing and cussing leads to blasphemy. Yes, ma'am. Good. Aaron, how we doing on finding that boy? I cracked all of his passwords fast enough. I thought I had a lead that would send us straight to him but it didn't pan out. Had to widen the gap. Need more time. How long have you been on that computer? 17 hours. Hey, you need dinner and some sleep. I've got frozen pizzas in the fridge. And a lot of soda. I can lock in and go 72 hours when I have to. Go to dinner. I'll tell you meatheads what door to kick down soon enough. Well dinner's on you, boss. I already said that. Yeah, just getting it for the record. Well, let's do it. Hey yo, pencil neck. You doing all right, 'cuz. My man. Allison has a boyfriend. Really? Grow up. Honey, do you think you could enjoy dinner without texting for - 10 minutes? - Mom! Hang on a sec. Oh, yeah, I'm hanging. Listen to your mother. You can continue your love affair after dinner, okay? Oh sure, Dad speaks and you listen. I ask nicely and it's "Hang on a sec." He's the man. Ooh. Who teaches them this kind of stuff? We have a progressive home. How'd these teenage girls succumb to these norms? You know, I just think Rachel's jelly because she doesn't have a boyfriend. Mhmm, and she's too young. Whatever. I don't wanna date some middle school boy. Next year I'll be a freshman and I'll get a football playing senior. Oh, fantastic. Hey, Tyler. Hey beautiful. I thought you'd never be online. I miss you. We just talked last night, silly. I wanna meet you so bad. Me too. Meet me tonight. I have school tomorrow. Just for a little bit. I promise I'll be good. Tyler? Hey. Hi. Where are we going? You'll see. No please! Keep moving! Stop, no. No, no! Stop! Shut up. Y'all hoes get back in your cages. Please let me go. Please let me go! I own you now. And you ain't never going nowhere. Honey, can you go tell your sister that breakfast is almost ready? Hold on, let me post something real quick. Now, young lady, please. Hey, breakfast is almost done. Ah, just coffee for me, hon, I gotta run. But you missed it yesterday. Oh, I gotta close this deal, babe. We need the money. That's true. All right, do you have time for a good luck kiss? Always. Allison? She isn't there, Mom. What? No, it's still early. Come on, Joanna, it's her birthday. She just probably snuck out early to be with friends. Sweet 16, big day. You remember what that was like. Yes, 100 years ago. Wish me luck, old girl. All right, old man. Y'all did good last night. Thank you, Daddy. Now y'all have some candy and get you a good sleep. Don't put you in no cages. You gonna come back and see me later? Oh yeah, baby girl. Just gotta break in this new girl right quick. Let one of the other guys do it. Bitch, shut up telling me my business. Lucky I don't beat your ass. Just take your candy and go to sleep. Maybe tomorrow I don't give you no candy. You feel me? No, please! Bitch shut up and get in your cage! First day of school, white girl. This is moi weird. She hasn't texted me all day. Same here. You think she's playing sick? On her birthday, no, that would be social suicide. Ugh, my phone is vibrating. Who calls anyone anymore? OMG, it's her mom. Should I answer it? Um, yeah. Hi, Mrs. R, is Allison okay? Not a peepster. Copy that. That girl is MIA. Man, you right about her. Dude, she gonna make us a lot of money for real. I'm about to go again. No. What? Go get you one them other hoes. What? You heard what I said. Man, come on, for real? Come on. Do that thing that you know I like. Please. Please, Mister. If you let me go home, I promise I won't tell anyone. My name is Daddy, not Mister. Daddy. And you ain't never going nowhere. Have some candy. Make you feel better. Rose, it's not like her. Not a single text. Well, she's 16 today. Maybe she's with her new boyfriend. What new boyfriend? Tyler. I saw a picture of him yesterday. Cute kid. She never told me. Well, you're her mother, J. It's a teenager's first prerogative to keep stuff from parental units. Hello? Hey hon, I just sold the Miller place. Done deal. Case, Allison's missing. What do you mean missing? I mean I haven't heard a single text from her, none of her friends have heard from her and I'm scared. Honey, it's her sweet 16. She's out with her friends. Look, just calm down. I'll be home in 10 minutes. Betcha she walks through that door any minute with that new boy. If I win, you're in to me for martinis at Al's. That's a bet I'd gladly lose. Look, why don't we give her another hour? No. Joanna, try to relax, dear. I can't, Mom, my daughter's missing. We don't know that yet. I can feel it in my heart, something's terribly wrong. All her best friends are here, she didn't go to school. No text, no post, nothing. I hope she's okay. Okay. I'll make the call. Okay folks, I'm sorry. Obviously Allison has been missing all day. My wife's a little upset so I think we're gonna call it an evening. Thanks so much for coming out. We'll reschedule all of this. But thanks, thanks so much. Yeah, right inside there. It'll be okay, Mrs. R. Allison can be a bit crazy sometimes. She'll be home soon. And she hasn't called all day? That's right. No emails, no texts. Nothing, just silence. She have a boyfriend? Well I heard this morning that she does. What? And how did you learn about this? Does it matter? Joanna, let's just answer the questions please. I heard from my best friend who happens to be her best friend's mother. Do you have the boyfriend's number? No, like I said, I just found out that she has a boyfriend. I don't know anything. Can we do something more proactive? Do you know the boy's name, ma'am? Trent or Trevor or something. We can call Rose and ask her. Well Mrs. Riley, your daughter hasn't been missing a full day yet. Is it possible she's off with this Trevor, Trent, Thomas guy and they're off partying someplace? And you know, just being kids? No, it isn't. Joanna. What? Yes, it's possible, officers. Look, whose side are you on? There aren't any sides here, Jo. Your daughter has run away before, Ma'am. No, my daughter's never run away. Two years ago, you filed a missing persons report- - No, she was at a sleepover and she came home the next morning. So we'll just give it a little time. Look, my daughter's missing! I know her. There's something terribly wrong and you guys are just sitting there! What do you guys suggest we do? Just give it a little time, sir. These things, they normally work themselves out. And if they don't? If she's still missing after 48 hours, give us a call. We'll come back, we'll file a report. Try to get the boyfriend's name, see if you can track down his phone number. - Can you do that? - Mhmm. They should be easy enough for us to find. All right guys, thanks for coming out. Our pleasure, sir. - Good night, ma'am. - Something's wrong. Good night, sir. Good night. I'm gonna ground that girl for a week when she gets back. Don't you mean if she shows up, Case? She hasn't texted me either, Mom. Case, she's missing. All right. Don't scare her. You're just standing there! Rachel, go to bed. But I... Now. Scoot. Okay. I'm gonna check all the hospitals, okay? You keep calling her friends. Okay if we don't find her tonight I'll call Mike and Justin and first thing in the morning we'll jump in our cars, we'll check out all the places where the kids hang out. Yeah. Tomorrow's Saturday. We'll look all weekend if we have to. We'll track down this Trevor guy who I'm going to kill by the way. Listen, Allison will be back in our house by Sunday at the latest. Okay? Oh. Mom. Aight, bitches. Grab your coats and let's go. Hurry up, we got paying customers in there. It's work time now, girl. I suppose you're thinking about running. Maybe you're thinking about asking one of them nice white boys for help. Or doing something stupid like calling the police. Don't. You see this? That your sister, right? You mess with me and she next. No, please. Oh she pretty too. I'll be good. You're in room 45. I'll be out here the whole time. You got me and I got my nine. I got you, now. Ain't nobody gonna hurt you, girl. Take this. Go on now. I'll be right here. Now what? Well, we go out again tomorrow. And if 48 hours goes by, we call the cops again and file a missing persons report. And um... And what? Nothing. No, don't do that, not right now. All right. I called Kessler. Oh god. Who's Kessler? Case's idiot friend from college. He's a loser. He's actually quite successful. He's a professional poker player and he sells weed. He's one of those guys with a 22 year old bimbo girlfriend. Is any of that relevant, Joanna? He knows people. Really? Who does he know, huh? Who does your pothead poker playing friend know? Never mind. I didn't wanna get into it. Just tell me who he knows. Belton Private Investigators. Kessler says this PI, John Belton and his crew will find Allison or die trying. John. You can't save every one of 'em. Sorry, guys. It wasn't your fault. You tracked the kid down, you found him. That's your job. I couldn't have done any better. All we can do is get back on that horse, boss. Belton Private Investigators. John Belton speaking. All right, Mr. Riley. How long has she been missing? Have you called the police? No, no, no, tomorrow might be too late, okay? I'm sending my to investigator out to speak to you. We'll conference on the speaker. Can I have your address please? Yes, sir. Clock's ticking. Hey, she broke in well tonight. Have a seat, ladies. Honey, you done good. I know the first time's always the toughest. Daddy? Huh, baby? Am I still your favorite? You is. You all is. John, she's 16. Blonde, 5'3, photos are on the way. Okay, got it. Listen, Mr. And Mrs. Riley, the police won't consider this a missing persons issue until 48 hours has elapsed. That means that if your daughter does not return you will fill out the necessary police report. Okay, got it. All right, Tex, go up to the girl's room. Toss it. Mr. And Mrs. Riley, he's gonna look for another cell phone, iPad, laptop, and address book, a journal, anything like that. I'm on it, boss. I'll show you. Mrs. Riley. We're gonna do this by the numbers, ma'am. Okay, my team and I are gonna question everyone that Allison knows. You're in very good hands. Thank you, Mr. Belton. And call me John, please. I hope this doesn't happen but we may be together for a little while. Well then no more Mrs. Riley. It's Joanna and Case. Okay, Joanna. Now I know the police may have asked you this before but does your daughter have any issues with drugs or alcohol? No. You're sure? Yeah, I mean I may have missed with the boyfriend part but I know her really well. She's not into that. Okay. Any past psychological issues, ADD, depression, anything like that? No, not at all, she's a great girl. She's a sweetheart, she's an angel, John. I'm sure she is, Joanna and we are gonna find your angel. Do you promise? I promise. She will be found. Laptop, old cellphone. I'm sorry, what was your name again? That is Aaron. Write down the name of her horse. Any other pets, middle name, best friends' names, favorite colors, favorite numbers, celebrity crushes, birthday, favorite holiday and everything else that you can think of. Hey, he'll have her passwords in 15 minutes. Me, I can barely find the speaker button on my phone. How do you take your coffee? Hot. Look, we're gonna find your daughter. This is what we do. John. How much is this gonna cost us? We're middle class. We're not rich. There's a standard commencement retainer of 20,000 tonight. Even if she walks in that door 10 minutes from now on her own. Whoah. Fine. And then it's 20k a week after that. John, I don't know. Case. I'm just trying to be practical, honey. We're talking about the girls' college funds here. We don't need college if we don't have our daughter. Maybe we should just think about it. Let the police try. Look, sir. I'm not trying to sell you on this, but the police, they're just not gonna do anything. That's just the long and short of it. Yeah, maybe she's with this boyfriend. Are you sure? No. I'm not sure of anything now. And that is the hell of it. Maybe Allison is doing a Juliet thing with her guy. But then again maybe not. Can we just have time to think about it? Honestly sir, every minute counts and we are on the clock. You want us to find your daughter we need to start right now. I'll pay for it. Mom, your retirement. How can I retire without my granddaughter? Barbara, we can't accept. You don't have to accept. Mr. Belton, you're hired. Computer nerd, keep doing what you're doing. You, Cowboy, get me the paperwork. Yes ma'am. You'll have your money wired to you as soon as the bank opens tomorrow morning. Find my granddaughter! I will. Mom. Where are you, pretty girl? I just hope it's not where I'm afraid you are. Well, did you enjoy church today, baby? It was cool. You're such a nice boy. You pick your grandma up, you take me to church. It ain't no thing. The Lord was good giving me a grandchild like you. I told you, I got you, Grams. All right, honey. Yo Grams. I put a little something in your purse for you. Oh, no, child! I can't take no money from you. I'll see you next week. Go on in there now. Bye. Drive careful. Okay. Our mission is one Allison Riley, age 16 as of Friday. Now missing for almost 48 hours, she'll be an official missing person as of tonight. Sweet little thing. No call from the parents this morning? No, not so far. I am working on the supposition that she is a taken. I'm betting I would say she's with the boyfriend. Yeah, yeah, I know that but I just don't think so. That damn nose of yours again, boss? It's a curse, but yeah. I got a bad feeling on this one. Aaron, tell them what you know. Her boyfriend Tyler is a typical catfish profile. Tyler is actually Ryan Mcnaff. Professional model out of LA. All the photos were taken from his various sites. The cellphone that was used to text Allison went dark at 11:05 p.m. Friday night. And I presume it'll never be turned on again. Trace down Tyler's cellphone. I'm guessing it's prepaid with cash. We might get lucky. Okay, Karen, get in touch with this Ryan Mcnaff out in California. The odds are overwhelming that he has no idea any of this is going on. But make him prove to you that he was in L.A. this weekend. Will do. All right, Maggie. The Rileys go to church at Vineyard. And they have a lot of friends there. Yeah, I know it. It's a nice place. All right, good. Well then make inquiries as only you can, church lady. Oh, getting paid to go to church. The Lord is good. Mhmm. All right Ben, hit the high school tomorrow. See if you can get her friends to tell you things that they won't tell their parents. So you're telling me to hit on high school girls? I'm telling you to go there, be charming and then leave. Man, I want a case at a college campus. Yeah, I bet you do. Biggs, head down to the usual hotspots. See if you can get any chatter out of the community. I'ma be working the homies all day, Captain. Karen, when you're done with that model in L.A., hit up the various shops and the street corners. See if the working girls know anything. Why do I always get hooker detail? What are we gonna do, put heels on Ben now? Rookie. All right, Ben, you actually go with her. Hang back but not too far. Her safety is number one, got it? Yes sir. Now guys, if our little girl here is a taken, every minute is an enemy. Okay, we're on the clock, let's do this. Come on. Well, our brothers and sisters in Christ, the Riley family are going through a tough time right now. Many of you know that Allison's been missing for some time. And we wanna pray for God's healing and comfort to come in their lives during this difficult season. So let's pray. Jesus, we ask that you would be with our brothers and sisters. We pray that you would comfort them during this difficult season. And we pray that you would help to bring recovery for this young woman who's missing. We pray Lord that justice would come into this situation. Would you help and bless and comfort and encourage this family, and help us Lord to be a blessing of support to them. In your name we pray, amen. What's up, big man? Looking for a girl, cuz. Girl? You gotta tell me what you want, man. White girl, about 16. Man. Oh she cute though. See that? She cool, bro. Yeah she nice. Yeah, she bangin, man. She a ho? Might be. A brother remember a girl like that. Suburban girl. Suburban girl, of course, of course. Yeah, that's why you be down here slumming with us huh? That's why you be down here all the time. Her daddy must be rich, huh? Huh, yeah, that's right. Hey, spread some of that love around here. Share the wealth. Tell me where the girl at, then you get paid, aight? I'll give you five Gs you tell me where she at. I'll give you 10 Gs you bring her to me, aight? All right man, I got your phone. It's got to be verified, aight? I got your phone. Aight, aight, aight, make it happen for me, baby aight? The Detective handling this matter will be Jack Carson. He's a good man, he walked a beat in his day. That's fine. Yeah we hired a private investigator too. Well that may have been premature, sir. We didn't think so. Do you mind if I asked who you engaged? John Belton. What? He seemed very professional. Professional? Officer Helsdon, just.. Wait, what about him? Well, he, let's just say he likes to work outside the box. He's not exactly orthodox. We'll that sounds exactly like what we need. We're gonna find your daughter, Mrs. Riley. Now having John Belton talking to the same people we are is only gonna get in our way. Unbelievable, unbelievable. Case, what is that? What's what? That thing on your hip. It's a gun, Barbara. Please don't ask me rhetorical questions. I don't have the energy for it. Why are you wearing it? Case. Because the second amendment says I can so I am. Can we just leave it at that and drop it? We're not gun people. Well I just became gun people. Do you have any idea how many gun-related deaths there are in the US alone? Barbara, this is not just some debate at one of your liberal arts colleges. My daughter's missing. My granddaughter is missing. Don't take that tone with me! Case. You have to see this. What? Captain John Belton, US Marine Corps, dishonorable discharge. Says here he disobeyed a direct order in the line of combat. He's been in and out of rehab for alcoholism three times! No wonder why your friend Kessler knows him. None of that matters, Jo. He's looking for Allison. Is he? Or is he just drinking away my money in some bar? Stay out of this, Barbara. Don't you tell me to stay out of this. I'm paying the bills around here. And strutting around like John Wayne isn't doing anybody any good. Why would we trust your friend Kessler, why? How the hell was I supposed to know? This is all happening so fast! Where are you going? Out, looking! And standing around here isn't doing us any good! Where? I don't know! Girls. Go to class. The bell hasn't rang yet. Sir, I'm a private investigator - for John- - One moment. Now, ladies. You're aware you have a girl missing, Allison. Yes, I'm well aware. We're all well aware. That's why the city employs a Police Department. We don't need wannabes scaring the children. Wannabe? Sir, I served two tours of duty with the United States- - Yes, yes, yes, spare me your resume, okay? Find your own way out. Let the police do their job. Just one guy tonight. You like that? Pay 1500 for three hours. Easy money. Just sit there, listen to him talk about he job and all that nonsense. Ain't like them other ones at the motel. He wants you to think you he girlfriend, see? Do good and it stay like this. You act like a cheap ho, you go back to the motel. 10, 20 men a day for a hundred a pop. Feel me? And remember, you don't want me to come visit your little sister now, do you? No. Go on girl. Make Daddy proud. Honey. Try to get some sleep. - Hi. - Hi. You really are beautiful. Want a glass of wine, sweetheart? Thank you. You're hot. I mean, handsome. I'll take both. What's your name, angel? Allison. So, Allison. Tell me something about yourself. I'm in vet school working specifically with horses. Horses? Why horses? Right before my 16th birthday, I went riding with my friends and I knew right then that I wanted to be a veterinarian. Brains and beauty. Wanna do me a favor, Allison? Sure. Take off that dress so we can go have some fun. Why don't you take it off for me? Talk to me, John. I need to hear something good, please. Just spoke to Ted Carson, the Detective on Allison's case. So we have the eyes of Bloomfield Hills PD on this as well as us, but I'm gonna be honest with you. The odds that she's still in the suburbs are slim. I've made calls to my friends at Detroit PD, they know about her and they have her photo but honestly, they are overwhelmed with their own problems. Is that it? Well I have a man on the street in Detroit. Everybody knows him, everybody respects him. The word is out to all the gangs that they can get 10 grand if they find your daughter. Now Aaron is working the computer. He hasn't found her yet. Sometimes the pimps- - Pimps? I'm sorry, Case, but we have to face reality. Oh God in heaven. Maybe... Maybe you don't want all the details. I want every detail, John. Go on. There haven't been any escort ads that match any of the photos from her social media sites. Aaron's run them all through the computer. Okay next he's checking for similar photos but that has to be done by hand and it takes a lot longer. Is that it? Well the noose is tightening, Case. But that's all I have for now. Thank you, John. Hey, how is Joanna? Things at home are not good, John. Okay, well that's normal. You two hang in there now, you need each other. I know. Thank you, John. All right, we'll talk tomorrow. Yeah. One week! One week, people and we got zero. Zilch, nada, nothing, come on! It ain't unusual, boss. Yeah, Captain, you know that. Yeah I know it, but I don't like it. Okay usually there's some sort of something in the ether, some chatter, some talk on the streets. We got nothing. There will be, boss. There will be, sooner or later. Aaron! Searching social media for any profiles using Tyler's picture. Nothing yet. Whoever this guy is that lured Allison out is smart. But I'll find him! Yeah, you better find him. Karen, my office. Come on. Karen, get in here. $20,000 check from the mother-in-law. What have you got? Nothing, not a peep. Our pros have heard zero on our girl. Right, tomorrow you start talking to everyone. Who? Everyone! Okay, their kids are gonna trust you. Her friends will trust you. I want you to call every single phone number in her entire phone. Got it? Got it. Rookie, where's the rookie? Tell him to get in here. Yo, Benjamin, let's go! Front and center, son. Sir? All right, I want you to coordinate with PD. I want you to give me every location that every kid has been picked up in the last year. Every single one. On it. Get me some leads, people, let's go! You need to get some sleep, Captain. Can't keep pulling these all nighters. We ain't kids anymore. I can sleep when I'm dead, partner. But I will take a cup of coffee. Where are you, kid? Everybody get up. We going for a ride. Ain't no working today. No, I don't know. I don't know. I gotta go okay, I love you. You did good. Allison, you up. Allison! Allison! Hi, Mom. Where are you? Everything's okay. Mom, I'm in Chicago with Tyler. Honey, just come home. We are not angry with you. Just please, come home. I have to go. Bye. What? No, Allison. Hello, Allison? No. - Allison? - It's disconnected. - Allison! - Call back. Hey there, it's Allison's phone. - Oh my god. - Dammit! - We traced her cellphone. - Is that legal? No, it's not. Do you have a problem with that? Not in the least, go on. And the call did come from Chicago. Yeah she's in Chicago with her boyfriend. Maybe. I hope so, but I don't think so. But she said that she was- - Joanna, please, just let, please, will you just let him speak? The cellphone went dark right after the call. Allison may have been coerced into making that phone call. I'm sorry, but it's a very real possibility. What? No, why, she wouldn't... - No. - When these girls are taken, Joanna, the bad guys make the kids call the parents. It's protocol to throw off the police. I'm telling you, she's fine. She's in Chicago and she's okay. She's with her boyfriend, she's okay. There is no boyfriend. What? At least there doesn't seem to be a real Tyler. Those pictures are fake. They're from some model in Los Angeles. The entire profile is a catfish. What? Whoever lured your daughter out, that's not his name. Those are not his photos and he probably doesn't even drive a Mustang. And when were you planning to tell us all this? Mr. Riley, my job is finding your daughter. You don't need every single piece of information, sir. The hell I don't! I don't believe anything you're saying.

You be working tonight. Take a real good look at this. I bet you ain't know Detroit has some nice neighborhoods, did you? High class negroes, Jews, Caldeans with they gas station money, big houses built back when the auto industry was booming. Henry Ford heself lived out two blocks from here. I bet you you didn't even know I knew my history, did you? Yeah, I know a lot more. I'ma get us a big house like this one day. Just gotta get my money right. He paid for three hours but I'll be right here. Go on now. Hi. Hi, sir. Wow. You're really handsome. What's going on? Relax, child. My name is Pastor Brown. You're with good people now. No, no, no, no. Daddy's gonna kill me. - Hold her! - No, no, no. - Hold her now. - No, no, no. Daddy! Let me go! You're all right. You'll be okay. It's all good. It's okay. Come on, go with me, okay?

What do we do? I'ma go out there and I'm gonna get his face on video. Good way to get yourself shot, sir. I lived a long life, son. If the Lord's will for me to die tonight, then I'll trust his will. If I go down, pick up my phone. Show his face to the world. Let me get my gun and go out there with you, sir. No, no. No violence tonight, son. You got this. May God bless you, sir. - God bless you. - God bless you. What's your name? I see your face! I see your car! You get out of my neighborhood! You stay out of my neighborhood! If I ever see you in my neighborhood again, I'ma forget I'm a pastor! John. Just got a call from one of my contacts at the hospital. A church group rescued a girl. Looks like she's been through the ringer. You know the type? Go on. The girl says that she's been imprisoned for a while. The nurse said that she mentioned a blonde girl. Description matches Allison's. Tex, go with her. Hi, we're trying to find Vanessa Garcia. Down the hall to the right, third bed. Wait, wait! What do you want with my niece? Private investigator, Ma'am. We're trying to find somebody we believe may have been kidnapped alongside your daughter. She's been through enough! She's answered the police's questions! Tell them, Pastor. Tell them to leave my girl alone! Ma'am, we're just trying to help find somebody. Esperanza. This man is trying to save other girls just like her. The Lord wants us to help him do that. If you think it's best, Pastor. I do. Thank you, Pastor. Hi. You here for Vanessa Garcia? One second. Thank you. Okay, I gave her something for the withdrawal. She's hooked on oxycontin. She's gonna crash hard, real hard. As tough as it is, talking to her now is probably the best thing, okay? There she is. Thank you. It's okay. My name is Karen and I'm a friend. Honey, what's your name? My name? Yeah. You remember your name, right? Vanessa. Vanessa, where did you come from? He used to call me his little songbird. I'm a singer. Daddy's house. Do you know where the house is? I don't know. I don't know. What's the house near, honey? I don't know. I don't know. Can you remember anything that's near the house? Dogs. There's a park and, there was a store in the corner. Good. Vanessa, have you seen this girl before? Yeah. She's my friend. Okay, and you're sure you know her? Allison. Vanessa? Vanessa, I want you to look at me. We will find Allison. Do you hear me? We will find her. And you, you're safe now. You're safe. Yeah. Yeah. She gave a positive ID on your daughter, knew her by name. She's ali... Allison's alive? Yes. And in Detroit? Well we assume so for the time being. What do you mean for the time being? Look, Case, these people that I deal with, they're smart, okay? As soon as they feel the noose tightening they get up and they move their operation to another city. Our leads are strong. Okay, we got some really good breaks. Thank you, John. How are things at home, Case? I haven't been home in a week. Well you tell Joanna we're getting close. John, be honest with me. Are we gonna find my daughter? If I tell her and we don't find Allison, Joanna will never forgive me. What would you do, John? Pray. I may be all prayed out. You always have one left. Yeah. Look man, give me the Caddy straight up for the Benz. Stolen? No man, it ain't stolen. I got papers for you and everything. Why do you wanna get rid of it? You talk too much. We talking business or we talking personal? Hey, you're on my lot. And I'm about to not be on your lot. You want my money or don't you? Straight up for the Cadillac? Straight up, let's go. Let's do it. 36 hours since Vanessa was rescued. The clock is still ticking, people. Biggs? Well, I mean there's a few of those Benzes floating around the city. Detroit's a big place. This might be the right Benz or it could be some other cat's Benz, I don't know. All right, but your contact says they are running girls out of that house. That's what the brother say, but he a crackhead. They'll say anything to get paid. The neighborhood? Well there's a dog park and there's a corner store too. Huh, but they call it that because there's one on every corner. Aaron. Park me up front of the house, I'll pick up the wifi if they have it. Probably pick up a few other houses too. I won't know which signal is coming from our house so I'll have to break the passcodes and that can take time. How much time? I don't know, time. Then it's gonna take me even longer to go through everything. I may have to break emails, social media, if they've recently cleared their history. All right, all right, all right, I got it, I got it. Tex, take the van, park it out there tonight. See what computer boy can get. I'm in their system, John. There's definitely some girls. There's just no pictures of Allison. You tell me that there's a tan Benz in that driveway, it's time to kick down some doors. No, sir. Cadillac, red. What do you wanna do, Captain? Stand down. What did he say, are we going in? We've been ordered to stand down. Dammit! I got it. Call everybody, get them in the office, now! Hoo rah, son. How sure are you? 100 percent. Ain't nothing a hundred percent. Find, then I'm 99. Somebody in that neighborhood is pimping out girls. I see them posting ads for it constantly. Biggs. I got one more guy. Said the house with the Caddy used to have a Benz over there. So now along with the crackhead, that now makes two. But my one new guy, he said he believes that the Benz was white. How do you feel about it? I'm not sure, boss. Maybe 50 percent. Case, it's your daughter. You gotta make the call. If we go into the wrong house, they are gonna move her. To some other city, Chicago, New York, Atlanta. I have no idea, we may never find her again. If we wait, we may get a stronger lead. The truth is, they know the noose is tightening. They know we're looking for her. They may move her in the next couple of days anyway. It's your call. Kick it down. All right, you heard the man, let's go. I'm going with you. No, you're staying here and letting us do our job. I'm getting in that car. You wanna stop me, shoot me. Got one coming to you, Tex! Get his ass out of here! Good work, son. Hoo rah. Allison. Excuse me. Alex? - Hey. - Hi. Where are we going? You'll see.
