(reel flickering) ("The River People" by The Walkabouts) (engine grumbling) - [Emmett] I've never felt comfortable around the AA program. I went to meetings when I first got out of treatment, but had difficulty spilling my guts to a room full of strangers, and so strangers they remained. But I don't remember anyone actually beating down my door to take me under their wing, either. Gradually, I stopped going. I'd found school instead. Once I got out of Shelton, I didn't plan on coming back for a long time. Maybe I shoulda stuck to my plan. - [Carrie] Hey Emmett. - Hey Carrie. (employees mumbling) Larry. - Hello Emmett. I heard you was in New York going to school. - I couldn't afford it anymore. Starting at Greenridge this winter. - Hmm, looking for work? - From what I read in the New York Times, doesn't sound like there is any. - New York Times. (laughing) Well, the gippos got spanked, 'specially out in Forks, but we'll be going balls out least 'til the snow flies. Next year, who knows? - You might be hearing from me, Larry, then. Thanks. Hey, you seen Del around? I'm supposed to meet him here. - [Logger] I think that's him right there. - [Emmett] Alright, I'll give you a call. - [Larry] Yup. - [Emmett] I needed some money, so I called my old buddy, Del, who I helped get into treatment a year after I went. He hadn't stayed completely sober like I had, but he wasn't out every week and shooting up cocaine anymore, either. Since I'd sobered up, his wife had put me on a pedestal. Del was more than happy to help me off it. - [Tony] How you doin', Del? - [Del] Hey Tony. Neighbors love me. This place used to be trashed. (rock music) Little music to keep the bandits at bay. (electric hum) - [Emmett] The smell was so sweet and thick you could almost see a haze forming beneath the halide lights. - Another week, should be pretty good. - [Emmett] What's pretty good? - [Del] Six or seven pounds in eight weeks. - You know, you can smell it all through the house. - Got you a spot all picked out. Cabin on the beach, garage on the property. We'll grow it in the garage. You won't be able to smell a thing. You wanna make your goddamn movie, don't ya? It's no different than working in a grocery store where they sell beer. - When can we start? Neighbors are gonna love us. - Yeah. (knocking) Your mom home? - Yeah. - Yes? - We just bought this property. You're gonna have to find another place to live. - Could you be the one to tell my husband? - Yeah, where's he at? I'll get you the address of his shop. He's not gonna like it. - I bet. - Jesus. - Fuck 'em. Goddamn slobs. We just bought your cabin. - So? - [Del] I want you out. - I got a business to run, here. You can't just come-- - I don't give a shit what your problems are. I want you out. Get lippy with me and I'll knock you on your slob ass. - I'm just sayin', I got a lot of valuable TVs. I need time to haul 'em off. - You do that. It looks like shit out there. Did you get a look at this teeth? Why would anyone trust their TVs to him when he can't even take care of his own mouth? - [Elizabeth] Just saw you guys at Bailey's TV. - Yeah? - May I help? - Nope, that's it. I have a little surprise for you, though. Laura wanted to see you. I hope you don't mind. - Why would I mind? - I don't know. - Hi, Emmett. (melancholy music) - Laura. - I was hoping to see you. I've wanted to apologize for a long time. I've been sober eight months, now. - Yeah, that's what Elizabeth said. You look great, Laura. - Well, sometimes I feel like I'm going out of my fucking skull, but it's worth it most of the time, I guess. I really admire what you've accomplished. Well, Elizabeth told me you came back to make a movie. - Oh, well, it's a short. It's about 20 minutes long. - [Laura] What's it about? - Loggers. - Oh, must be a documentary on that endangered human species, huh? - Good to see you Laura. - [Matt] Hey. - Hey, Matt. (smooches) Hey, this is Emmett. I told you about him. - Laura tells me you're three years into the program. - Yeah, something like that. - I celebrated my first birthday last week. - We gotta go. You can hold the AA meeting next time. Bye, Emmett. (melancholy music) - These should be ready to plant as soon as the cabin's empty. - Looks like I'm gonna need a job to get through the next couple of months. - Call Larry Dugan yet? - Actually, I'm thinking about staying in Seattle until school starts. - The whole idea was to have somebody live out there. - It'll just be for a couple of months. - What do you see in that town, anyways? It's just one big traffic snarl. - [Emmett] The movies are better. - Oh, bullshit. They show the same movies everywhere. - I don't know if I want to work out in the rain. - [Del] 'Fraid you're gonna melt? - No, but in New York I worked in a nice warm office with pretty women. - Well, Seattle ain't New York. You'll be lucky to make five bucks an hour and the women will be wearing dresses down to their ankles to cover up their fat legs. - Maybe. Goddamn rain, though. - Hey Emmett. Try some of this. My wife made it. - Thanks. - Does it feel good to be back? - Yeah, it's alright. - You know we don't have much time left, don't ya? - Dugan said 'til the snow flies. - I think that's not gonna be very long, now. (rain pattering) I used to look forward to the winter shutdown. - Dugan said they were gonna start logging the lowlands. - See the machines they use? What's the rest of us supposed to do? (squishing) (doors slamming) - You better be able to keep up, LeClere, because I don't got no time to fuck with you. - Fuck you. - What'd you say? - Eat shit. - Just fuckin' with ya. (rustling) (rain pattering) (somber music) (clanking) (horn blows) (horn blowing) (somber music) (rain pattering) (horn blows) - Rough day. - Yeah? - Got stuck with that goddamn Gerry Pose. - He's dumber than a hemlock stump. (machine whirring) There's the future. One man crew farming ecker poles. Fuck 'em. ♫ Down here ♫ Everyone says that (laughing) ♫ They belong ♫ I know ♫ What's it's like to be a stranger (chattering) - A cloud. A peanut. (laughing) A comet. Sperm. - [Woman] Time. - A fish? That's what that blob is? A fish. - I told you I don't know how to play this stupid game, alright? - But anybody can play this game. I mean, a fish has a fin. (laughing) That's a fish. It has a fin. ♫ Sent the best people ♫ And suddenly outpost Hey you. Are you mad at me? - No. - Well, you got awfully quiet in there towards the end. - I'm always quiet. - Yeah, until you burst into conversation and then you talk about a mile a minute. - Matt's a pretty nice guy. - Yeah, he is. I'm going to break up with him. I'm gonna fix you dinner next week, okay? - Okay. (soft music) (somber music) - I told him. - Have you been drinking? - No. I mean, yes, just one after I told him. He started crying. I didn't expect that. - [Emmett] Maybe I should drive. - [Laura] I'm not drunk. (doors slamming) You still want me over? - Yes. - I am sorry. I was so looking forward to this and then as I drove by that bar, it's like this car had a mind of its own. - Goddamn car, huh? (chuckling) - You're right. It's the car's fault. (melancholy music) Not bad. I never even knew about this point. Looks like logging's been pretty good to Del this year. Built that new house and now this place. - [Emmett] Well, you know Del. The only person I know who can put money away while collecting unemployment. - Yeah, he built that house by hoarding his pennies. (tapping) (somber music) (smooches) Do I smell better now? - Yes. - Well, you smell like a wet tree. (water rushing) (melancholy music) (waves crashing) - If you get here early enough, we can stop and get some dinner on the way. - Okay. - Look, if you don't wanna go, you don't have to. - I told you I wanted to go. Careful out there, sweetie. (smooches) Hi honey, it's me. I just wanted to let you know that I had to go to a meeting with some people from work and if I can't get out of here in time to have dinner with you, then I'll just meet you outside the meeting, okay? Love you, bye. (machine beeping) (chattering) - [Woman] He still has to (mumbling). - [Woman] Coming in? The meeting's about to start. - [Emmett] Naw, I'm just waiting for someone. - [Woman] Okay. (door squeaks) (rock music) (engine grumbling) - Emmett! Emmett, are you up? Emmett, I'm sorry. (knocking) Emmett, let me in. I want to talk to you. Emmett! Ow, fuck! Emmett, I hurt myself! That really hurt, you know. Oh, you still have that rose I bought you. Hey, alright. Gets pretty boring, doesn't it? Don't be mad at me, okay? I hate that. (melancholy music) You're so sweet. - [Radio Announcer] Get ready for a mixed bag of weather today, folks. A little rain, some sun, even some snow headed our way. Forecast is calling for a cold afternoon and evening with temperatures dropping-- - Goddamn snow was supposed to be here last night. - [Radio Announcer] Snow expected in the Olympics tonight. Taking a look at sports, the Huskies travel to... (melancholy music) - You know how they are out in Dunowat don't ya? Well, this young man brings his future bride home to meet the family and pulling his father aside, he tells him he's got himself a real, honest-to-goodness virgin. Now, his old pop mulls this one over for about one minute, then informs the kid, "Son, if she ain't "good enough for her own family, she sure as hell "ain't good enough for ours." (laughing) If she ain't good enough for her own family, she sure as hell ain't good enough for ours. - Hey, Earl. See my elk yet? - That's a nice one. Where'd you go this year? - Down around St. Helens. Out of six of us, four got their meat. - Check this one out. Six-pointer, bagged her yesterday. - She's a beaut, Dog Balls. (chuckles) - [Dog Balls] Thanks. - Great. (chattering) (squishing) - Why isn't this yarder broken down? I got the lowboy right behind me. Goddamn! - Oh, Larry, we thought, uh-- - Thought? Thought what? Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, LeClere. Use your fuckin' head. A woodpecker does. Earl? Earl, what the fuck are you still doin' here? - Heard Adam didn't show today, boss. - [Larry] Take one of the chokermen as a spotter. We ain't gonna get any logs out today, anyway. - Dugan's a goddamn nose-picker as far as I can tell. Shoulda run him off 25 years ago when I had my chance. Believe I've seen you around. You Del Barnes' partner? - Yeah, he's a friend of mine. - He's pretty savvy. You a climber, too? - Nah. I like my feet on the ground. - Ha, yeah, me too. (squishing) (rain pattering) See that unit of second growth across the way? - [Emmett] Yeah. - That's where Forrest Hamilton invented the shotgun, back in '65. I logged it with him. I was a young pup, then, like you. Me, Hungry Jack, Dugan, Eddie Three Elk, Neutral and one other. Can't remember. Don't matter, most of 'em are dead now, anyway. I gave my youth to this company. (wipers squeaking) (somber music) Let's get to gettin'. (rain pattering) - [Emmett] You want me to carry it? - I'll pack it down. You can pack it back up. - [Emmett] Earl still moved well for his age, though I knew humpin' back up would be slower. 40 seemed to be the magic number when the legs deserted you. I'd seen guys prancing around like young bucks one year and the next season come back from winter layoff with legs that never quite recovered and a look of bewilderment on their faces. All that knowledge, but no legs. Maybe that's why they grew as savvy as they did. They didn't have the energy to be stupid anymore. (chainsaw buzzing) (creaking) (thudding) - Why don't you build a fire? - There's no diesel. - What's wrong with pitch? Jesus Christ, your mother know you're out here? (fire crackling) - You know, that wind's not exactly dying down, Earl. - You call this wind? I used to partner with Typhoon Teddy, that greedy son of a bitch. He never went in for no wind. It could be blowin' 50 miles an hour and old Teddy'd just time his cuts between gusts. - Yeah, right. - You don't believe me? They shoulda never gave you guys unemployment checks. I believe it's made ya unduly lazy. - I bet you turn 'em down all the time, huh? (chuckles) Well, we're almost through up here, anyways. - Got a direct line to the federal courts, do ya? No one's told me anything yet. Goddamn. If I knew it was gonna be this cold, I woulda wore my socks. (melancholy music) (cracking) (thudding) - [Emmett] Two-five, this is 0-3-8, two-five this is 0-3-8. Do you read me? - [Woman On Radio] This is two-five, I read you. - [Emmett] I got a man down in unit 2-5-4. I need help right away. - [Woman On Radio] Is it bad? - [Emmett] It's bad and it's gettin' worse. - [Woman On Radio] We'll send somebody right up. (somber music) - [Man] You okay? Alright, oh no. What happened? - It was a widowmaker. He's dead. (somber music) (helicopter blades whirring) (rustling) - [Larry] You alright? - [Emmett] Yeah. - [Larry] Goddamn widowmaker. What a shitty deal. I wanted to let you know we just got the official word to start pulling the equipment out as soon as we can clear the roads after Thanksgiving. The mill's looking for younger guys with some education and you already passed a drug test. Interested? - [Emmett] Sure. - [Larry] Well, gimme a call after Thanksgiving and I'll set ya up an interview. - [Emmett] Okay, thanks. - [Larry] Take it easy, okay? - [Emmett] Yeah. - Heard you on the radio. - Yup. - Was he a mess? - Little blood. - I carried Stupid Stanley's leg out that time he got caught in the haywire. That was a mess, and heavy as shit, too. Like lead. - Well, I didn't have to carry anything out. He was dead and so were all his parts. - You know, I don't worry about dying. I just don't wanna get maimed. Turn into one of those old winos you see in the taverns bragging about how much they made off each missing finger. - Well, you won't have to worry about that anymore. (somber music) - Look how clear it is. Ladies first. - Let Emmett go first. Jesus, Del. You're just a regular fuckin' whiz with that thing, aren't you? - Havin' an off night. You're perfect Laura? (somber music) (waves crashing) - You alive, sweetie? Now me. I want Emmett to do it. He's gentle. Okay, sweetie. (wind whooshing) (rock music) ♫ Just because I want to feel this way ♫ Just because there's nothing left to say ♫ The close-up thing gets me so high ♫ Far above the stars and sky ♫ Drops me like a stone until the (mumbles) ♫ Why ♫ Oh why ♫ 'Cause I don't want anymore pain ♫ More pain no more pain ♫ Yow ♫ Feeling lucky toke 'em on the deck - [Woman] Don't you people ever stop? ♫ Loves as (mumbles) as things she said ♫ Tie your arm and make a fist ♫ Throw away your grocery list - [Emmett] Eat that. - Okay, we'll see you soon, bye bye. - [Del] I'm gonna kick your ass. - [Laura] He needs some trees cut down.

Elizabeth got you pussy whipped? - That's it, Laura. I'm afraid of Elizabeth. - You're not ready to go home, are you sweetie? Come on, what's your trip? - Fuck, I don't know. - Shit. You better be quick, Laura. (doors slamming) (tires squealing) (bells tolling) Fuck! (soft organ music) Scoot over! - [Laura] Fuck you, what's your problem? - [Del] Laura, shut up. (somber music) (water rushing) - Emmett, why don't you come in here with me? It's nice and warm. - Laura, Laura, I think my heart's fucked up. - [Laura] Oh, Emmett you know how-- - Goddammit Laura, call an ambulance! (somber music) - Any heart problems in the past? - No. I've been shooting up cocaine. - [Paramedic] How much? - I had an ounce, maybe more, between three of us. - Let's start a line and give him two milligrams of morphine. - [Nurse] What is it? - [Paramedic] Drugs. - [Nurse] Oh, no, you're too old for this nonsense. Who's your doctor? (somber music) - [Laura] Emmett. - [Emmett] Laura. - How are you feeling? - Okay, just a panic attack. - Yeah, I kinda figured. I remember I used to have them sometimes. - [Emmett] Not like that. - Well, you're fine now. - It's like I never even quit. - Well, can I get you anything? - No. - I should get going. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. (smooches) I can come pick you up when you get out if you want. - [Emmett] Maybe we should wait. - Sure. No problem. You know, maybe they're not such a bad thing. - What's that? - Your panic attacks. At least you have something that makes you stop. - [Emmett] A week after I got out of the hospital I went to work on the swing shift at the mill. I was quality control, but I didn't give a shit. My job was to offload from a conveyor the lumber that the automatic sorter had fouled up, fix the load, then return it to the system. The proper way to perform my job was to locate the bad piece of wood and take the load apart by hand to replace it with a good piece, then rebuild the whole mess. A load took me 45 minutes to repair all while the surly fat guy running the conveyor beeped his horn at me. After a week, I devised a brilliant shortcut. I'd cut plugs from the scrap wood pile and hammer them into the holes, making the loads appear good from the outside and no one ever the wiser until they showed up in Boise or Bozeman or bumfuck or whatever other crappy two-bit town that was their fate. Four weeks into this nightmare, we went out on strike. It couldn't have happened at a better time. The I.R.S. had tracked me down that week for not filing my unemployment benefits three and four years before, during my winter logging layoffs and had taken most of my last check, leaving me just $54 for two weeks' pay. They couldn't touch a strike pay, however, so a hundred bucks per week free and clear looked pretty good at that point, not to mention the occasional brick of cheddar cheese courtesy of the union. By the time the strike ended, I had already started school so I went back to work just long enough to collect the bonus check that was part of our settlement. I knew the I.R.S. would garnish most of the $1,200 due me, but at least they'd be two-thirds paid off. When I opened the envelope, though, I discovered three checks instead of the two I expected. The first two were my bonus and regular check that the I.R.S. stole, but the third was a mistake bonus check untouched by the I.R.S. I cashed the check as soon as the bank opened. - [Man] Thank you. - [Madeline] Welcome. - [Emmett] Do you mind if I put up an advertisement? - No, that's what the wall over there's for. What kind of film you shooting? - A dramatic piece. - Well, that's refreshing. They seem to push documentaries here. - You interested in working on it? I could use some help producing it. - [Madeline] Mind if I read the script first? - No. Won't be shooting 'til the end of the quarter. - That's okay. I'm just getting organized here, myself. I have a sign business up in Port Townsend I'm trying to sell. - Emmett LeClere. - Madeline Wilde. - I'll drop the script by sometime this week. - [Madeline] Okay. - It was nice meeting you, Madeline. - Bye. Hi. - [Woman] Hi. (chattering) - I liked your script a lot. I organized an intervention for my father a couple months ago that also failed. It was a horrible mess. You really nailed it. - Thanks. Couple people have already turned it down. - Really? Friend of mine who cleans my house found it. She's an ex-junkie. She couldn't stop reading it. Said she had to sit down when she got to the shoot up scene. - [Emmett] Sitting down is good. - You must be a friend of Bill W's, huh? - Uh, yeah. Actually, I haven't been to a meeting in a while. - [Madeline] Oh? - Yeah, I don't know. - Well, there's several good meetings in town. - Yep, thanks. - If there's nothing else, I have to take care of some things. - [Emmett] So, you're in? - Yes. I think it's something that should be made. This is fantastic. I could picture myself living here. - Oh yeah? It's kinda gloomy for me. - Reminds me of theory I had about your screenplay, but maybe I'm wrong. Wanna hear it? - Sure. - I saw you across campus a couple days ago. It was raining hard and everyone was running for shelter except you. You looked completely comfortable in the rain and I realized that's what this story's about. Scott Bain can't go through with treatment because he can't stand to be inside. He has to be out in the open. - Yeah. - Does that make any sense? - Yeah, I think you're right. - Were you always a writer when you were logging? - No, it just happened. Were you always an artist? - Ever since I can remember. How'd it just happen for you? - About three months after I quit doing drugs, I took a night class in writing just to see if I could do it, since I never did anything in high school and I was thinking about going back to school. After about three weeks, it just started to open up for me. On the last day, the teacher called me up to her desk. She was very formal, a commander in the Navy or something and she taught at night, and she could barely look me in the eye but she said that she'd been teaching for a long time, and she'd never seen anything quite like it. Told me to keep writing. Best moment of my life. - That's a wonderful story. - Thanks. (melancholy music) They'd already turned Govy into a ghost camp. 80 years of bustle, men and machines, dull wit and hangovers, death, gone. We drove farther up into the mountains, but most of the roads I knew were already bulldozed over, the worked-over mountains gasping for new life. (melancholy music) - [Madeline] It's a shame. - Man, what a drag. You never did mention what stoop labor this is. - [Del] It's farming. What kind of labor did you think it was? - [Emmett] Just wish we could pay someone to do it. - Like what? Put an ad in the Mason County Journal? - Wish we had something. My back hurts. - You lazy fucker. - I don't see why they have to be so perfectly trimmed. - 'Cause that's the way the fat man likes 'em. - Just thought there was more demand than supply with pot smokers. After a day in the drying box, we had over eight pounds to sell Minnesota Fats, as Del called him, 'cause he was fat and from Minnesota and Del, he wasn't always so original in his wit. But when he opened the door, he didn't look so fat to me. (rock music) When we stepped into the room, I saw why. They didn't even care they didn't know us, just kept driving that dull needle into bruised flesh. (rock music) - You call this trimmed? - [Del] If you don't want it-- - Easy, Barnes, easy. You're a man with a prickly nature. I just respect quality is all. (chuckling) Just a couple of capitalist growers, eh? - [Emmett] We walked out of the house with $18,000. The I.R.S. didn't get a cent. (somber music) Want some coffee? - [Madeline] Yeah, milk, no sugar. - [Emmett] Okay. - [Laura] Later, thanks a lot. - [Emmett] Hey Laura. - Hey yourself. You don't return phone calls anymore? - Been busy, I'm trying to get my movie together. - Yeah. You with that? - [Emmett] Her name's Madeline. She's helping me out. - Yeah, I bet she is. She looks like a real bitch, but that's what you're looking for, isn't it? A real cunt to lead you around by the dick. Domesticate you. - You know, you don't smell so good, Laura. You ought to go take a shower. Sorry. - Fuck you, Emmett. (cans clanking) - [Emmett] Here you go. - Thanks. - Just need to stop by a friend's house so we can get some breakfast, okay? - Okay. - [Emmett] Hi. - [Elizabeth] Hi. - [Emmett] This is Madeline. Madeline, this is Elizabeth. - Come on in. Del's upstairs. Emmett, you know my dad. - Right, hi, John. - Hi, hi. How you doin'? Good to see you again. - This is Madeline. - Hi. - [Elizabeth] Hey, baby. Del, Emmett's here. Hello, hello. (grunts) Del, did you hear me? Emmett's here. - I heard you the first time. - [Elizabeth] Why didn't you answer, then? - Hey, Del. This is Madeline. - Wow, a hundred dollar bill. So, you're giving him hundred dollar bills, Dad? - Get outside. Now! - We gotta take off. It's good seeing you again, John. Is something wrong? - That was depressing. I really dislike people who threaten their children with violence. - He's just got a lot going on right now, alright? He's got a lot on his mind. He's never hit his kid, never. - I still don't like him. I've never met anyone so uncomfortable in their own skin. He wouldn't even look at me when you introduced us. - I think he's a little shy. Been friends a long time. - I'm sorry. I just think you can do better than that, Emmett. - [Emmett] Thank you. It's delicious. - You like it? - [Emmett] Mmm hmm. - I think we should feed the crew vegetarian. It would save a lot of money. - I don't know about that, Madeline. We're gonna have a lot of meat eaters to contend with. If you get 'em mad at us, they might eat us instead. (chuckles) - Well, if they should become suspicious, I'll just pipe up from my corner. I got plenty of meat in my taco. How 'bout you, Emmett? You got plenty of meat in your taco? (chuckles) Mind if I ask you a personal question? Where are you getting the money for this? - Well, I have some savings and I'm getting some student loans. - How come Del gave you money that day? - He does tree work and I help him out sometimes. - Must pay pretty decent, huh? - [Emmett] Yeah, not bad. - You think you'll get any of your money back? - Well, I'm thinking about trying to sell this to some drug treatment centers. - [Madeline] I could see that. - Madeline, how'd you get sober? - Why? - Just curious. - Port Townsend is a small town and one day I realized I was the town drunk. - [Emmett] How? - One particularly hungover morning, I came out of a store and saw a woman, who I thought was a friend, walking towards me. She hadn't seen me yet when a car backfired and I looked the other way. When I looked back, she was glancing my way as she hurried across the street. Hit me like a ton of bricks. What's yours? - I thought I was going mad. - What a winsome couple we'd make. I need a little time up in Port Townsend to organize my assistant before we shoot. - [Emmett] Well, we got most of the important stuff done, anyway. I can come up and give you a hand if you want. - There's really nothing you can do, but thanks. You're a very charming man, Emmett. I like you far more than I ever thought possible. Bye. (engine puttering) - [Emmett] Hi. - [Woman] Hi. - [Emmett] Welcome. Good to see ya. - [Woman] Good to see you. - [Emmett] How was your flight? - Well, it was kinda bumpy. - [Man] Hey, Emmett, how you doin'? - [Emmett] Good to see you, Greg. - [Man] Good to see you, too. I'm gonna grab the bags, alright? - [Emmett] Thanks for coming, man. Thanks a lot. - [Woman] Everything's so pretty. Green. Your film's gonna look great. I'm really tired of shitty New York. - [Emmett] Well, the car's over this way. - [Woman] Okay. - You guys got everything? - [Man] Yeah, yeah. - [Emmett] Do you need some help? - [Man] Nope. - [Woman] Oh, thank you. - [Man] Good to see ya, man. - [Emmett] Good to see you, too, man. How things been? - [Man] Nice truck. - Thanks. It's a friend of mine's. He's letting me borrow it for the shoot. Just put your stuff right here. For my lead actor, I called a guy I used to work with, Dallas Shale. I knew he wasn't working that winter because Del has started fronting him the pot to sell once we discovered the fat man was a junkie. Dallas was a find. Not only could he act, but he offered to put up my crew from New York, which turned into everyone else coming down from Seattle. (soft music) (chattering) We took over his whole house, storing equipment, cooking meals and even using it for a couple scenes, all while Dallas wheeled and dealed from the back room right underneath Madeline's nose. Wanna finish it? Pretty funny, huh? - Ha ha. It's the funniest thing you've said all day. I was looking through my meeting schedule and there's a good one tomorrow downtown at noon that I go to sometimes. You wanna try that one? - Okay. - Okay. - You guys are going to a meeting, huh? - Would you like to come with us? - Yeah. Yeah, I bet it'd really help. I've been puttin' it off for too long. - That's wonderful, Emmett. It really does help put things in perspective, you know? - Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the agnostic and our personal adventures before and after make clear three pertinent ideas. A. that we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives, B. that probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism and C. that God could and would if He were sought. I've asked Gus to chair the meeting and he's accepted, so I'll turn the meeting over to him now. - Thanks, Bruce. My name's Gus and I'm an alcoholic, a drug addict and an atheist. - [All] Hi Gus. - I've got a bad back, a wooden leg and I was circumcised with a chainsaw. Tonight's subject is going to be on honesty, and I'm not talking about cash register honesty. I'm talking about the kind of honesty that comes out of your own mind about who you are and who you are not. That's the kind of honesty that's gonna keep you sober in this program. You're gonna have to look at your conditioning, who you are, how you got that way. - I've been having a pretty difficult time these last few weeks and I came in and there was this guy at the meeting. He has about 13 years in the program and, he's done a lot of work. He's well-known and respected and all that and he started talking and he started out by saying he didn't have any wisdom whatsoever to dispense to anybody here. He was feeling real sideways and messed up and fucked up and I'm listening to him. He started talking and just listening to him I got to thinking this guy's crazier than a shithouse rat, And I was thinking that's just what I'm looking forward to when I got 13 years. I gotta be as crazy as he is, but as I was listening to him, something started to come home to me. - I haven't been to a meeting for about three months. I been clean and sober for 18 months and I guess I didn't think I needed to come anymore. Thought I had everything under control, but I was wrong. My old boyfriend called from Portland last weekend and said he wanted to come up and see me. I told him on the phone that I'd been... - [All] Keep coming back. It works. - He'd be perfect as background for the treatment center scene we're shooting tonight. Do you want me to ask him? - Yeah, okay. - Hi, my name's Madeline and I was wondering if by chance you would be interested in helping us out? We're filming a movie tonight, and my friend, Emmett, is actually making the movie and... - Triggs? - Yeah. - We're going shopping for groceries. You can come with us or you can take my car and go back to Dallas'. - I think I'll head back. - Okay. - Thanks. (melancholy music) - You're awful quiet. You okay? - Yeah. Was just thinking about what that woman said about her own family ripping her off. That makes you realize how lucky you are, doesn't it? - Must have been a good meeting, huh? - Yeah. (mellow music) (slow bluesy music) - Hey, you're kinda in the way right there. - [Man With Long Hair] Oh man, I (mumbling) sorry. - [Man With Dark Hair] Thanks. - [Triggs] Oh, excuse me, man. - [Man With Long Hair] Oh, shit. - Yeah, okay. I'll make sure, yeah. Tell my sister you love her or I won't let her cook for you when she comes down tomorrow. - [Emmett] Hi, I love you. (mumbling) - Hey, mind if I play your guitar? - You know how? - Yeah, I can play a little bit. - Sure, go right ahead. - Cool, man, thanks. Appreciate it, it's a beautiful guitar. - Yeah, I got it at Sears. (strumming) - Oh, that's beautiful. I got a slide here I wanna play. ("Train To Mercy") ♫ Last time that I saw him ♫ He was on the killin' floor ♫ Last time that I saw him ♫ He was on the killin' floor ♫ It's a late train to mercy ♫ But I hope it never comes ♫ It's a late train to mercy ♫ But I hope it never comes ♫ Moves just like the winter ♫ Cannot stop it in a course ♫ Moves just like the winter ♫ Cannot stop it in a course ♫ I heard the brake man holler ♫ He cannot slow it down ♫ I heard the brake man holler ♫ He can't slow the damn thing down ♫ It's a late train to mercy ♫ But I hope it never comes ♫ It's a late train to mercy ♫ But I hope it never comes ♫ Makes you beg, steal or borrow ♫ But I hope it never comes ♫ It's a late train to mercy ♫ But I hope it never comes (applauding) - [Emmett] When he finished his song, the crew gathered around him, now interested in his story, and long after things had gone bad and I was alone with my editing, his voice would come back to me through the Steenbeck speakers and always, when the song ended, I could hear Madeline and me chattering away together in the background. (engine grumbling) Great house. - Thank you. It is pretty, isn't it? I got it eight years ago when they were almost giving them away. I put a lot of work into it. - Must have been tough gettin' used to that room you rent down at school. - Come on. I'll give ya the tour of the house and then we'll go to my sister's. (knocking) - [Woman] Hi. - [Emmett] Hi. - Come on in. I'll make you guys some coffee before I go. So, I shouldn't be more than an hour. I'm just gonna go help my assistant set up and then I'm gonna come back home. - [Madeline] When's Denny getting back? - Day after tomorrow. - [Madeline] Hi. (melancholy music) (chattering) (child sneezes) Bless you. - [Woman] So, I'm gonna go to work you guys but you can stay up until I come back, okay? - Is there anything you need me to do to help? - Yeah, (mumbling). (melancholy music) - Hey, can you say hi to my friend, Emmett? - Hi. - Hi, Emmett. - [Emmett] How are you? (mumbling) What? (mumbling) - That's not polite, Josie. My sister hates bees. She likes you, though. (melancholy music) (bells tolling) Emmett, come in here and keep me company. - [Emmett] Cup of joe for the pretty girl. - Cup of joe, huh? - In the woods, if you got there early enough, you could stop and have a cup of joe with the boys, kinda like a networking party for loggers. - And I bet you showed up early every morning, right? Yeah, I didn't think so. I wanted to talk to you about something I've been thinking about. - Okay. - It looks like I won't be selling my sign shop, at least through spring and summer. So, I was wondering if maybe you might wanna move up here with me? We could edit film on Jim's machine and if you need some extra money, I could teach you how to prep signs. It's really beautiful up here in the summer, you know? - Yeah. - What do you think? - Well, you know, I've got the house I'm renting to deal with and... - Well, I wouldn't want to force you into anything that makes you uncomfortable. - Oh, no, no, it's just there's some things that I need to take care of is all. - It was just a thought. Forget it. (phone ringing) Hello? Del. - Yeah? What, you can't handle it? Well, yeah, it's gonna take me a couple hours to get down there. Okay, alright, alright, fine, okay. Okay, bye bye. I've got to give Del a hand. A tree he was topping hit part of a house. - What does that have to do with you? We were gonna spend the weekend together. - [Emmett] I can be back up here by six. - Fine, do what you want. - Fuckin' mites again. I showed you this before. You're supposed to be keeping an eye on this sorta shit. Look, they're fuckin' dwarfed. - You know, the guy at the grow shop said never to use that after they start to bud. - Well, if you'd do your fuckin' job, I wouldn't have to. (hissing) (water rushing) - I don't understand why you needed me to come down. - 'Cause you're the one that's supposed to be taking care of this stuff. That's why you're here. - Yeah, well, I'm thinking of getting out. - She's got you coming and going, doesn't she? Fine, I'll get somebody else out here. - [Emmett] Okay. - You gonna finish out this crop? I mean, if you don't want to, I'll gladly take the extra eight or ten grand. - It's only three or four more weeks, right? - I don't wanna corrupt your newfound morals or anything. - No, I think I can stick around that long. (engine grumbling) (door squeaking) I told Del that's it. No more calling me at the last minute like that. - That's nice. - And also, I called my landlord and I gave notice. I move out in four weeks. - Yeah? Where you gonna live? - Hopefully with you. - Sorry, changed my mind. - I'd be homeless. - Poor Emmett. - You know, maybe I could start off in the studio and gradually work my way into the house. - That's a laugh. Like I'd trust you around my paintings. (mellow music) - Where are we going? - To a meeting. - Oh. - Don't worry, it's a speakers meeting. Heaven forbid anyone should know your little secrets. - Except you. - Yeah, you're life's such an open book to me, isn't it? (mellow music) (thudding) - [Woman] Get in, get in. Hands up! Hands up! Federal agent. We have a warrant for your arrest. Turn over, turn over. (mumbling) Put your hands behind your back. - [Emmett] She didn't know anything. She didn't know anything. - [Man] Shut the fuck up! (somber music) (footsteps crunching) - [Emmett] When she looked at me, I glimpsed something in her eyes besides the anger. She knew me. I never saw her again. (somber music) They didn't charge Madeline, but I served nine months in the county jail, then moved to Seattle and found work stocking shelves on the graveyard shift at the Home Giant. (melancholy music) Near my apartment in the north end is a non-alcoholic nightclub. Open 24 hours, they serve thick sandwiches and strong coffee. Nights when they have live music, throngs of smiling, healthy-looking people mill around outside in the cool night air.
