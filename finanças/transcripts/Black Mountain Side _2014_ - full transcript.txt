Here it is, trying to buy the pot. Here he goes. Buying the pot. -He doesn't have enough to buy it. - Buying the pot. What do you got? Let's see 'em. - That's lucky. - No he has. That's a flush. - He had a flush. - You're lucky. It's called being The Champ. That's what it's called. I'll give you "The Champ". Take your God damned money, damn punk. Thank you very much! Fuck yeah. Fuckin' stripper girls on me tonight, boys. It's gettin' cold, boys. I could share some of this with you gentlemen, if you'd like. It is the first of November. Well, look at this. One month from today, I'll be sippin' margaritas with the lady in Florida. - Florida? - Every year, baby. Christmas in Florida. Margaritas, huh? Is that, Disney World or Disney Land in Florida? What was that, excuse me? Is it Disney World or Disney Land in Florida? Fuck Disney World. I'm there for the women, dude. I'm a grown man. The women and your girl? Well... That's what this money will help me get, right? Well, I like a white winter. So what's the deal, you staying here again this year? - Yeah. - Fuck. - I love it up here, you know. - You poor son of a bitch. Stupid. Alright. I like the double pay, man. I'll need it after this poker game. Double pay. Yeah, yeah. I wanna see this. C'mon, give me something good here. Let's see what we got here. Here we go. Game on, bud. Jensen! Jensen, come in! Fuck me! Chopper's comin' in. We got company. Outpost NTC-291, this is DBA Transport. Stand by for landing. - Check. - Check. Fold. Alright, everyone. This is Professor Olsen. Head of archaeology for U of T. Head of field research for the SAA. Professor. Francis M?nro, project director. - Pleasure to meet you. - Likewise. I did a paper on you in University. That's Drew McNaughton, he's our equipment technician. And Robert Michael Giles, field supervisor. What he's doing here and not on site is beyond me. I'm on my break. And that's Dr. Richard Andervs, site assigned medical supervisor. - Pleasure to meet you. - Likewise. Let me know if you need anything. It would be nice to do something around here for a change. Let me show you the lab. - You want in here? - Yeah. Alrighty. You're up. And this is Steven Welles, he's here on a corporate internship with a company in Calgary. He's been my assistant for the past few months. - How's it going? - Well, thank you. You've got a very impressive resume. Thank you. Professor Olsen is here to write a report to hopefully get us a grant from the SSHRC to get us more funding and more hands. Hey, that would be great. I really look forward to working with you. Likewise. So, how was the trip in? Long. Yeah, it's a long ride on that chopper. You're lucky, it's three times as long if you were to ride up during a storm. Is it usually this cold out? It's not usually this warm. - Really? - Yeah. So I... bet you're wondering why they sent you up to a Northern Paleo Indian outpost. - Something like that, yeah. I'm curious what they told you. Unusual Clovis findings. That's all? They were pretty vague with the details. Yeah, we were pretty stingy with the details ourselves. Looks pretty standard, right? Yeah, I'd say. Standard Clovis culture. Yeah. The past three years we've stationed here, that's all we've dug up. 11,000 B.C.E. Clovis. It's pretty interesting stuff. Nothing too exciting though. Right. Two weeks ago, we found this pot. 11,000 B.C.E. Clovis pottery. It's interesting, but not impossible. Yeah, that's not what's interesting, though. We found it under sediment dated to 14,000 B.P. 14,000 B.P. Clovis pottery. Nope, not Clovis. Pre-Clovis pottery? Mesoamerican. I mean, it looks Mesoamerican. It's got similar symbols and markings. We're over 4,000 miles from the nearest Mesoamerican site. There's one hundred different reasons for this being here. Early trade activity in this area, ceremonial burial of a more recent culture. Something like that. Right, but 14,000 B.P.? Well, you know that radio-carbon dating's not always accurate. Right. We've also started unearthing a structure. A structure? A week ago, we began unearthing a large object that we think is the roof of a structure that goes down... Well, really far. How far? Maybe a meter. Maybe ten meters. We don't know. We don't want to jump to any conclusions here. I mean, it could be nothing. It could be planted... We don't know. - Right. - But... If this is the real deal, then we're looking at one of the biggest finds in the past century. We are right in the middle of the ice-free corridor and this could confirm that theory. Over the past three years we've covered over two square kilometers of ground. Going as deep as 12,000 B.P. of sediment. Have a good night. - Any of them speak English? - All of 'em. They speak Dogrib with one another, but they're all fluent in English. Any of them have experience with Archaeology? Not one of 'em. No, they're all from a reserve about a hundred miles south of here. We just pay the, band council and they give us workers. Usually finish this early? We don't get much sunlight up here. And when the sun isn't up, it hits fifty below. Sun goes down real fast. Yeah, get stuck out here for long and your blood will freeze. I wouldn't want to be the poor son of a bitch to have to experience that. Okay, gentlemen. Thank you again. How many hours of sunlight do you get? What, this time of year? I don't know, like five. Five and a half. You know, we try to use as we can but come December and January we barely get any at all. So, what do you do with the other nineteen hours? Drink, mostly. Welles and M?nro sleep there. That's my office. And there's the communications cabin. That's where Jensen is. And McNaughton and Giles, they have their own cabins, they're over there. And, uh, this is us. Home sweet home. That's me. Ramis, the site chef, he sleeps in there. It's pretty small. Cozy. It's a shit hole. You're upstairs, c'mon. I'll show ya. And, finally, your room. Bed's kind of shitty, but it'll do the trick. That heater takes about an hour to start to work, so... Sometimes you gotta smack it around a little. You're gonna need blankets, pillows... There's a stack of that stuff in laundry room. It's the next room over. By the way, it gets kind of loud. - Wonderful. - Yeah, it sounds shitty, but there's a little vent there that siphons hot air from the machines into this room so it's actually not that shitty. Believe me, in a couple of days you're gonna be thankful we gave you this room. Enjoy. Hey, puss. Gibson, get off the table. Gibson! Okay. Beat it. - Bye, puss. - We're out of eggs. Alright. Anything else? Yeah, we'll be out of milk soon. Okay, I'll radio it in tomorrow. How many more sites like this are there? There's a site like this one every hundred miles or so. Two dozen spread across the whole area. Any of the other ones have anything like this? Not that we've heard of. We're out of radio range. I was reviewing some of the photos last night. If you look here, these kind of look like symbols of a Trecena. It's a Mesoamerican period of time. It's similar, but it's faded so it's hard to tell. Maybe a simplified version. Now, if you look over here, that's... That's nothing, it's just an image. Maybe a hunting ritual? Something like that. How far down do you think it goes? No clue. Based on the depth of the bedrock in the area, I'd say three feet. Maybe as many as ten feet. Outpost NTC-291 calling Station-9, over. Outpost NTC-291 calling Station-9, over. This is Station-9, what can we do for you, 291? Over. Hey, how ya doin', Station-9? When's the next supply drop at this location? Over. Hold on a minute. Let me check that for you, 291. Sunday, November 10th. In three days, 291. Over. Okay great, uhm... Can you add... Let's see. Hang on one second here. ...milk, cigarettes, and eggs to the list, please? Over. Sure can do, 291. Eggs, milk and cigarettes. Over. Great, thanks a lot. Over and out. Hunker down with a bottle of Whiskey and a - box of porn. - Yeah, well it's much deserved, anyway. - To whiskey and porn. - To whiskey and porn! You know what, while on the subject, - how about a toast... - Mhm. - to the crew... - Yep. - who will be remembered... - Mhm. - for the greatest archaeological find - Yeah! - possibly ever. - Alright. I like the sound of that. - Cheers! - Gentlemen. Cheers. And you'll be remembered as the guy who sat on his ass the whole time it was happening. I'm okay with that. So, what do you think, Doc? What do I think about what? About that temple out there. What do I think? Who gives a damn what I think? I'm a doctor, not an archaeologist. - It doesn't get old, does it? - No. - Oh, man. - Jesus Christ. Olsen! What do you think? About the temple? - It's probably not a temple. - Whatever, you know. How far do you think it goes down? Just based on experience, if I was looking at a similar structure, in the Amazon, based on shape, size, some of the defining characteristics I would put it about 20,000 B.C.E., which is, well, not possible. - Wanna know what I think? - Yeah, what do you think? Aliens. That's just... Hey, hey. You laugh now, but wait until we start pulling up little green bodies. You're a God damned idiot. Where's the file on Alpha-226? Alpha 200 to Alpha 250 is listed under fifty-nine. Well, this one is labeled one hundred. Red files are one hundred, blue files are two-hundred. Fuck, this is giving me a headache. Why don't you just call it a day? Yeah, maybe I will. Come in, Jensen. Over. What's up, Giles? Can you come down to the site? I think you better see this. Yeah, I'll, be right down. Over. What the hell? What is that? It's Ramis' cat. Jesus Christ, who did this? I don't know. One of the workers? Why would they do it? This is fucked up. McNaughton? Yes. Why would McNaughton kill the cat? I don't know. - You saw this happen? - Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'll look into it. You can go back to work. This makes no sense. Hey, McNaughton, come in. Yeah? Did you kill Ramis' cat? No. Well then, who did? I don't know. Navaron just came into my office, he said he saw you doin' it. He saw me do it? That's what he says. Uhm... Nope, I didn't do it. You'll figure it out. I believe in you, buddy. Copy. Okay. Would someone please tell me what the fuck is going on? Just get up here, McNaughton, I'll tell you everything when you get here, okay? Hey Doc, wake up, I need you out here right now. What the fuck is going on? Jesus Christ. What's going on? Three of our guys are gone. The other two went lookin' for 'em. - Three of the workers? - Yeah. - Giles still here? - Yeah. What do you mean, gone? I mean they're gone, what the fuck do you think I mean? - Well, why, man? - I have no idea why! - Guys, guys! The workers are all gone. - Fuck. - Yeah. - All but two. - What about Giles? Not Giles. - You didn't hear 'em leave? - No, I didn't. There's some tracks from the cabin, going to the reserve. - They're going back to the rez? - I don't know, I guess so. - What? Walking? - Apparently. This is fucking great. Three weeks before wrap, you think they'll send more guys? I doubt it. Why would they leave in the middle of the night when it's fifty below? Maybe they got spooked. Spooked? I don't know. They believe in all sorts of wacky shit. Maybe something spooked 'em. Yeah? Like what? The cat? Yeah. Maybe the cat. You know, it's possible. They are a pretty superstitious people. So, they see the dead cat, freak out, and leave? And then wait until the middle of the night? I don't know. Maybe it was the cat in combination with something else. You know, an animal sighting or something. What do you mean, an animal sighting? Animals have a lot of significance in Dogrib mythology. They can come in the form of demons, gods, or whatever. So these guys see a moose in the camp and run for the hills? Well, regardless, we can't work without more guys. I'm going to call it in. Well, I wouldn't say no to an early winter break. Five months alone here is more than enough. What happened to "can't say no..." Christ! What the hell is wrong with him? - He's got no fever. - What did you eat? I don't know, the same shit you guys ate. Alright, let's get to my office to look at ya. Jesus Christ. Come in Station-9. Over. Station-9, come in. Over. Station-9, come in. Over. Station-9, are you there? Come in, please. Over. So, what's the word? We goin' home, or...? No, I couldn't get a hold of anyone. What the hell's all this? Welles threw up. Is he okay? I think so. So what do we do? Go back to work until we can get a hold of someone. Alright. Keep those walkies tuned to the worker's channel, that's channel 3. And keep an ear by the two-way. If anyone calls, we'll be back before dark, alright? - Yeah, yeah. - If it's Station-9, - tell them to send an E-Vac. - Yeah, yeah. Look, I know it sounds trivial, but it's important. I don't care if you have to take those radios with you when you take a shit. Just stay by them, alright? - Okay? - Okay. Still feel like shit, eh? Yeah. And you've been feeling progressively worse throughout the week? Yeah. Any conditions? Anything? Not that I know about. Alright. How've you been sleeping? I'm not. Open your mouth. Okay. My best bet is you got a real bad flu. How'd I get it? Well, sometimes, someone has a virus, but they have the antibodies so they don't even realize they're contagious. - Right. - Then, they give it to someone else and they don't have the antibodies, and then they get sick. I'm going to give you some new pain killers, and some Triazolam. It'll help you sleep. Alright? Think they went home? Just doesn't make any sense. I mean, they don't have any of their stuff. They've got no supplies. They're not gonna make it very far. Not in this weather. Fuck, it's cold. Yeah. What's wrong? Has anyone else been up here? Why? What? We lost? We're not. But these tracks aren't going to the reservation, they're going in the complete opposite direction. No one's been out here as far as I can tell. These tracks are headed north. Reservation's south. Well, if they're headed north, they're definitely dead. It's not in bad condition considering it's 11,000 years old. Yeah, well nothing comes up here. On top of that, it's all untouched, buried beneath snow and ice. The reserve where the workers are from, they don't come up here ever? No, the town they all took off to is the northern most town for hundreds of miles. - Really? - Yep. We're the northern most outpost. 291 out of 291. Stop that. Most northern outpost by about ninety miles. - So what comes up here, then? - Nothing. So, why are we here? Same reason 290 is there. And 250... 226, 215... Some surveyor found some scribble on a rock and figured it was important enough to waste years of people's time and government money. Yeah, nothing comes up this far north through these mountains except for the odd charter plane. Even those stopped coming up here after that one went down, fifty miles from here. Engine failure, from the cold. So what motivated them to build a camp here? Rock pile formations, the usual stuff. You can see the initial reports. Jensen's got 'em in his office... Stop that! Same old stupid shit. - You wanna pass me that can? - This one? I guess it's empty. We've got three more cans back in storage. How long can we go for? I say we got supplies for... two weeks. At the most. Supply drop was supposed to be three days ago? Yeah. Fuck. Okay. We're on for now. Just put it down there. Is it on? Yeah, okay? I told you, this thing works fine. I just wanna see. Test, test. Turn the dial. The dial? Test, test. Try ninety-eight. - Test, test. - Test, test. See, it works. They must have theirs turned off. Or they aren't there. Maybe there's a storm on the other side, who knows? Well, just rig a loop to ninety-eight. Okay? Yeah, there are stone piles like this one every couple of miles or so. They're all about a mile from my initial dig spot, where we found most of the Clovis points. You think this means the Dogrib knew about the temple? Nope. That's likely just a coincidence. Stone piles like these are really common among native cultures. They're used to mark important spots like, uhm... ceremonial burial grounds or recurring settlements. Our theory is, that these were used to mark a hunting spot for deer, or maybe bear. - A lot of bear in this area? - Yeah. But you don't have to worry about that, this place is covered in bear traps. And those will really fuck you up. - Bear traps? - Yeah. Put down in the thirties by the Dogrib. These stones were put down maybe five, six hundred years ago. You see, the natives, they kept a close eye on this spot for a few thousand years, along with some other spots that we haven't started to excavate yet. No markings? Nothing? Just boring old stones. Your specialty's Clovis. Yeah. Since grad school. - Graduation year? - '02. You ever seen anything like this? I've never even heard about anything like this. Yeah. You don't think we're trying to pull some sort of elaborate hoax, do you? Nah. The radio-carbon dating you had done on the structure - places it near the end of the ice age. - Yep. - And it's a solid structure? - Right. People didn't stay in one place during the ice age. Carbon dating of the artifacts suggests that these people were here for a span of a few hundred years. That's what doesn't make sense. Maybe they found ways to adapt to the cold. Then why did they leave? Where did they go? South, to form early Mesoamerica. If they were going south, they would have gone south. For Christ sakes, would you cut it out? I'm bored. Go to work. You're still on the clock. What clock? There's nothing to do. Why don't you try fixing that radio? You are the equipment technician, aren't you? That fucking radio is fine, alright? Everything on it works. Except the part that lets us talk to other people. It's the ranger's station's radio that's fucked, alright? Nothing I can do here can fix that. Well, if you aren't going to go to work, knock it off with that God damned ball! - We're out of cream. - That's fine. Look at this. You see here? That looks like a simplified version of something you'd see on a Mayan or Aztec wall. - Really simplified. - Right. What's strange is that, all of these symbols mean nothing in any Mesoamerican system of writing. Aesthetically, they look Mesoamerican, but there's nothing here to suggest that that's what this is. I think that the similar aesthetic is likely just coincidence. So, what does it stem from? Well, it doesn't look like anything from South America, so it's out of my expertise. I do believe, however, that what we're looking at is not a writing system, but a systematic series of drawings. A lot of them are animals. Maybe a hunting ritual? Cave wall kind of stuff, but just with more of a coherent style. So, maybe a culture that was here before the ice age. They built the structure to survive in the cold, but they didn't make it to the end of the ice age because of the cold. McNaughton, you in there? McNaughton? I'm coming in, okay? Hey. Why didn't you answer the door? Sorry. I was just... reading. Right. We saved you some lunch. You missed breakfast, too. Are you okay? I'm fine. You need me to get you anything? Something to drink, or...? I'm fine. Okay. Your lunch is in the kitchen. -Jensen, come in. Jensen. - Yeah. Meet me at my office, I heard screaming. -Hurry, I think it's Welles. - What? Alright, yeah. I'll be right there. What's going on? Doc heard screaming. He went to go check on Welles. - And? Is he alright? - I don't know, it's fucked up. Help me find it! Just look! It's okay, Welles, it's okay. Help me hold him down! What the fuck are you waiting for? Jesus! It's right here! - What the hell!? - Hold him down! - It's moving up his God damned arm! - What the fuck are you waiting for!? - Hold him! Hold him! - Shit! Holy fuck! What do you want me to do?! What the fuck is that!? - Cut it off! - Cut it off, yeah! The fuck is going on here!? No! No! - Hold him down! - No! - Giles, hold him down! - Take it easy, kid. - Hold him. Hold him! - Easy kid. Olsen! Olsen what the fuck are you... Clear! - What the fuck is that, man!? - Okay, deep breaths. - Hold on, kid. Hold on. - What are you doing? - Get the fucking morphine. - Deep breaths. Hang on kid. Almost there. Almost there. Almost there. Almost there. Fuck! Fuck. Anyone ever been sick like this before? - Yeah, all the time. - I'm serious. You puttin' this in your report? I'm putting everything in the report. Woah. This has nothing to do with the site. The report's not just about the site. It's about the entire camp. Look. Professor. We brought you up here to check on that structure, and get us more money. You want more money, you have to address the issues. Issues? What issues? The guy's sick. It has nothing to do with the operation. You weren't properly equipped to deal with the situation. That's bull shit. We cauterized his arm with a fucking shovel. Yeah, well we weren't exactly anticipating a God damned amputation. - You're ill-equipped. - You know what, fine. Do your report. Maybe we can use the grant money to buy a fucking CAT scan machine. Francis. Do you see it? Woah! Jesus fucking Christ! What... Jesus Christ! McNaughton! Anyone, come in, come in, anyone! - Is anyone there? - Is anyone there? - Is anyone there? - Is anyone there? - McNaughton's lost it! - McNaughton's lost it! Come in, we're in the lodging cabin, he cut off his fucking hand, get Doc! - He cut off his fucking hand, get Doc! - I'm on my way, over. Okay, bud. Just calm down. What's up? What's happening? It's going to be okay, Doc's on his way, okay? Just relax, McNaughton. - Dude, what... what the fuck is... Hold him down! - What happened? - He cut his arm off! What's wrong with him?! Help me hold him still. Hold him still. Tie it up! Hurry! C'mon, hold on, McNaughton. It's probably safe to assume you've never heard of anything like this. Is he gonna make it? I don't want to sound pessimistic, but I doubt it. Not as long as he stays here. And McNaughton? I've got him on an anti-psychotic. - Did it work? - We'll see. I'll keep a close eye on him until we can get him out of here, but... He's probably gonna lose the rest of that arm. He made a real gnarly mess out of it. Christ. GOOD. THIS WAY. FOLLOW MY VOICE. OPEN YOUR EYES. GOOD. I CAN SEE YOU, JENSEN. Any symptoms? Feeling sick? Dizziness, headaches? No, no, I feel fine, I'm just... tired. Have you been sleeping? Yeah, some. I wake up and then I can't get back to sleep. - How long's that been going on for? - A few weeks. It's probably stress. You have any heart palpitations? Shortness of breath? No. Just waking up for no reason? Yeah, pretty much. I have been... having this, uh, dream... though. Well... Sometimes when you dream the body releases adrenaline. Wakes you up. Is it a nightmare? No, it's not a nightmare, I mean, it's not like I'm afraid, or anything like that. What's the dream? I see this... person. These people, I guess. They're... like us, but they're not. It's very strange, uhm... I just feel like they're watching me. I don't know. Alright, well. I'll get you some sleeping pills. They'll help reduce REM sleep. - You got any allergies? Heart condition? - No. Okay. All the artifacts were found within thirty feet of the structure. They all have animals on them being portrayed as god-like creatures. - That much is fairly evident. - Right. Based on the sheer amount of effort that went into making all these artifacts, and the structure, and the consistent use of animal imagery on all of it, there's no question that this site was extremely important to them. - Probably a place of worship. - Right, like a shrine. Now, one recurring theme in a lot of these pieces is the deer. This deer god is very important to them. Maybe a creator god, like Kukulkan in Mayan, or Ehecatl in Aztec religion. - You alright? - Yeah, just thinking. As for where they went to, look here. A lot of early tribes and civilizations were wiped out by disease. Obviously, they had no medicine back then, and they had no understanding of the concept of germs and bacteria. Now, this piece. This is our youngest piece by... about a hundred years, so far. Now, if you look here... these resemble people but, what's strange is that they're disfigured. In all the other pieces, their portrayal of people is fairly accurate. Standing up, arms, legs, heads. But that's not the case in this piece. People are missing appendages, they're slouched over. I believe this depicts... an illness, a plague. As the ice melted, the bacteria could have been unfrozen. I mean, the time line of our pieces ends near the end of the ice age. It's just a theory. So it wasn't the cold that killed them, it was the cold protecting them, in a way. Exactly. So everyone dies... then no one comes through for thousands of years, letting the thing get buried beneath sediment and ice. Interesting. Well, it's interesting, but it's not what I'm worried about. - What are you worried about? - I'm worried about Welles. Welles. You think what he has is what this artifact is showing? It's happened before. The Curse of the Pharaohs. So, we're looking at a bacteria that's ten to eleven thousand years old. Frozen, deep in the ice along with that structure and these artifacts. Someone was sneaking around the outpost last night. - Who? - You tell me. I don't know, maybe it was an animal. For Christ sake, that was no animal. It was speaking words, I heard it outside my room! Look! I'm hearing things, we're all hearing things, okay? But there's no one out there. We're in the middle of nowhere. This is just stress. It's not stress! There was someone outside my fucking window, speaking fucking words to someone else! What are you suggesting? It's one of the crew? I'm suggesting, someone in our crew is sneaking around, snatching up all our supplies and is going to leave us with nothing, - and then we're fucked! - That's insane. - Is it? - Yes. - Is it insane? - Yes! Is McNaughton slicing up his arm insane? Is all our workers waking up one day and deciding to walk one hundred miles in the arctic winter insane? Just look into it! LOOK. AS HARD AS YOU CAN. DON'T LOOK AT THE TREES, OR THE MOUNTAINS. LOOK PAST THEM. LOOK. I just found him here like this. He must have untied himself and taken my rifle. Well, that's just wonderful. Did he have a family? Ex-wife and a kid. Yeah, divorced though. Still... Do an autopsy. See if you can find out what was wrong with him. Any word on a rescue? Not yet. Wash your hands. I think I'll take a shower. Are you gonna watch me cut him open? No, thanks. Fuck... I ran some tests on the tumors that were forming under his skin. The cells aren't human. What are they? They bare similarity to the cells of a cephalopod. Octopus. There were traces of human cells, but they were weird in the sense that they were in the process of changing. Into what? Into the octopus like cells. Or squid or whatever. You're trying to tell us that Welles was turning into an octopus. Well, sort of. The cell formations that were building on his muscle tissue, they would detach once they reached a certain size. I ran some blood tests earlier, and the invader cells were present in his blood stream. And more than likely in his spine, too. Welles is turning into an octopus. More like, thousands of tiny little ones. - What the fuck does that mean? - It means that he's really God damned sick. I can't dumb it down for you more than that. - Jesus. - Yeah. - It's not possible. - Oh, really? - Tell me more, professor. - Guys! Guys! What are we gonna do? Well, I've got him on every antibiotic I have. Hopefully, it can stop the invader cells. - Otherwise... - ...we have to get a fucking aquarium. What about McNaughton? I found the same bacteria in McNaughton's blood stream and his spine. Which leads me to believe that this bacteria, it spreads like tertiary syphilis. Okay? It starts in the spine, it moves to the bones, the muscle tissue, the skin and then eventually, as in this case, the brain. So, the bacteria drove him insane? Well, it's a bit of a stretch to make that kind of diagnosis, based on the fact that I've never seen anything like this before. I mean, he could have had a mental breakdown due to isolation sickness, or a schizophrenic episode brought on by stress, or the bacteria. I mean, he was exhibiting signs of schizophrenia. Sudden temper, depression... But I'd have to see his family's medical history, and I can't access that from here. All right, so what do we do? We need to get Welles to a hospital or he will die. I can keep him pumped up with antibiotics, but... Hopefully he can fight off the side effects. Is it... contagious? Probably. First thing tomorrow, I want that structure re-buried, I want the artifacts quarantined, I want the whole site sterilized. What? You can't re-open this site until you've quarantined, tested, and surveyed - all the wildlife in the area. - That'll take years. You're already responsible for the death of one, maybe two crew members. You started excavating before the site was deemed safe, and now you're dealing with the consequences. - To re-bury the site... - We are dealing a dangerous bacteria that we know nothing about. What I saw come out of Welles' arm... I won't have you, or anyone else subjected to. I'm not going to throw away three years of work! Look, he's right, okay? This is foreign to anything I've ever seen before. We don't know what it can do. We shouldn't fuck with it. This is fucking bull shit. FRANCIS. COME HERE. DID YOU SEE IT? I saw you. WHAT ELSE DID YOU SEE? Nothing. There was nothing there. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU. Who? THE OTHERS. Why? THEY THINK YOU'RE GOING MAD. Am I? THEY THINK YOU'VE GOT IT. Do I? THAT'S RIGHT. GOOD. You're up late. First thing tomorrow, we're going to quarantine these artifacts, start a report so we can get the ball rolling on re-opening this site. Okay. You okay? Yeah. I mean, I've seen some shit before, but nothing like that. This thing goes sour, I'm the one that has to explain it to his parents. KILL HIM. If a rescue doesn't come in the next few days, I think a few of us should go hike up to the reserve. - DO IT. - Sure. KILL HIM. Weather's going to break in the next few days. I think it might be smart to take advantage of that... ...while we can. Okay. You need anything? No. You sure? Yeah. Alright. Stop! - I... - Stop! Why? He was in pain. I put him out of his pain. He was in pain. His face, I've never seen anything like it. - It was horrible. - Just step back. All the way to the wall. Step back! Just stay the fuck back. What did you do? What the fuck did you do? He was in pain. He couldn't die. He wanted me to kill him. I didn't want to. But he wanted me to. He made me do it. He made me do it. So I cut his wrist, but he didn't die, so I, I cut his throat, but he kept screaming so I thought if I take off his head, and I kept hitting him! - Step back! - He didn't die, man! He didn't die! - And I didn't know what to do! - Stop! I kept trying. I tried to stop his heart but it didn't stop. It didn't stop! And it was horrible! I didn't know wh... It was so horrible. It was... It was... He made me do it. I swear to God. I swear to God, he made me... He... Jesus. What the fuck is going on!? I... I didn't... He... I want to go home. I would like to go home. No, I told you, I want to go... No, don't... No! Freeze! He made me do it. Don't try anything, or I'll fucking shoot you. Please. I had no choice. I'm going to be out in the room, right here, so don't try anything! - We'll let you out when the rescue comes. - No! Listen to me! I had no choice! Giles! He made me do it! Giles! Giles! Listen! Giles! YOU DID A GOOD THING. Your blood pressure's good. Liver checks out, kidneys are fine. Thyroid... It's all fine. Hey Doc, come in. Go ahead. Yeah. Look, I'm down at the supply shed, I just need a hand. I gotta get a bunch of these boxes inside. Can you come down? Copy. I'll be right back. Who's there? Hello? Olsss... Olsen... McNaughton? Oncho...cerca volvulus. It lays it's maggots in human skin, - which survive in the eyeball. - Shut up! It only lays it's eggs in humans. Why are you telling me this? Five million people a year - to propagate it's species. - Shut up! Such tiny, insignificant creatures. It was... Speaking to me, I... I swear, it... It was speaking. It was saying something about maggots, and it wouldn't stop, and I... I had to stop it. I... I stopped it. When was the last time you slept? I'm not sure. - You're hallucinating. - No. Maybe. I... I don't know. It's... It seemed real. I'm going to give you some sleeping pills so you can get some rest. Lack of sleep, it triggers hallucinations. - It seemed so real. - I'm going to give you some Xanax, too. I want you to take these and get some sleep. I'll take care of this. I brought you some soup. We're gonna hike up to the reserve tomorrow, if... What the hell happened to you? Do you not see him? There's not much of that left, so you just make it last. Please tell me you see him. You see him, right? I don't. I don't see anything. - What should I see? - He's here. Now. Listening. Watching. He's watching me, Jensen. I can't move without him watching me. - I can't move! - Just calm down! - Okay? It's alright. - I can't do it anymore. He wants me t... He made me do it. Okay, just tell me what you see. He's behind you. What's he doing? Watching you. Touching you. Watching me. He's angry with me. He's going to do something. I don't... - Who is he? - A deer. He's a deer. It's... No... I don't know! Don't leave me. This is all in your head. I don't want it anymore. I'm going to see if Doc has something for you, okay? No! Jensen, please. Stay. Please. No! Jensen! Come back! Jen, come back! Where are you going? I think we should hike up to the rez. The weather's gonna be nice in the next few days. Yeah, it looks like you already thought about that. - I was going to tell you guys. - Really? Because it looks like you were about to leave us here. I was not going to leave you guys. What? Were you just going to take the rest of our food with you, too? I'm not ditching you guys. Just making sure you got the map and the flashlights? - You got the batteries there, too? - Hey! There's other maps and there's other flashlights. I'm not fucking ditching you guys! I know your type, Jensen. Fucking sociopaths. Acting all respectable and altruistic until your opportunity pops up, to get ahead, and bam, there you are, pushing the rest of us out of the way. - Well, guess what? - What? If I see you touching any of our shit, I'm going to shoot you. And then I'm going to kill you, and I won't hesitate, and I won't have no sympathy, because people like you got it coming. People like you have it long coming! Don't think I don't have my eyes on you. Scared me. When was the last time you slept? I don't know. Yesterday? The day before? - Okay, I'm taking over. - Why? - So you can sleep. - No, I'm fine. Worry about yourself. What, you don't trust me? - Why should I? - What did I do? What did McNaughton do? What'd he do? You know it's going to be a long winter if you're gonna spend it up here - by yourself not trusting anyone. - Well, if that's what I have to do, then that's what I have to do. I brought you this. I don't want it. When was the last time you ate? I don't know. Eat it. No. I can make my own food, thank you. - It's not poison. - Leave me alone. Fucking hell, man. It's freezing cold. You're not going to eat, you're not going to sleep? You're going to die in here. Then let me die! Worry about your fucking selves, I'm fine. Fuck! Motherfucker! Jesus fucking Christ... He's dead. Doc's dead. Jesus Christ. This is bad. - It's not that bad. - No, you're losing a lot of blood. There's probably some internal bleeding. Fuck! We need a doctor, I don't know what I'm doing. - We've got to get to the reserve. - You can't go anywhere like this. You gotta go. I'll stay here. - You'll die. - I'll be fine. There's a... trail behind the site. It goes all the way to the reserve. It's about... ninety miles. If you hurry you can get there in a day and a half, so... just... Okay. Sun's coming up in an hour and a half. You'll be down the mountain in, I don't know... five. And it's going to be a lot warmer then, so... There's a map... in my room. - I'll be sure to send help. - Okay. STOP HIM. STOP HIM. GO. STOP HIM, JENSEN. You're not real! What do you want from me? WHEN AN ANIMAL LOOKS UP AT THE NIGHT SKY, WHAT DOES IT SEE? THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF TINY POINTS. THEN A MAN LOOKS UP AT THE SAME POINTS AND SEES MILLIONS OF STARS. GALAXIES, WITHIN WHICH ARE BILLIONS OF PLANETS. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I SEE? WERE YOU THERE, WHEN I CREATED THE STARS? No. SPACE? - TIME? - No! BUT STILL, YOU THINK YOU DESERVE UNDERSTANDING. I've done nothing to you. I'm leaving your home. YOU DON'T REALLY THINK I'M BOUND TO THAT STRUCTURE, DO YOU? ARTIFICIAL CARVINGS ON A STONE? CERTAINLY, YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT I CAN BE OMNIPOTENT, OMNISCIENT, BUT NOT OMNIPRESENT. You're not God! God isn't cruel. He doesn't kill men like this! - NO? - No! - DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? - If you are God, tell me why! Tell me! I HAVE TO GO. Why don't you stop me? Because you're in my fucking mind, - that's why! - WHY DON'T YOU THINK I'M REAL? Because you're a fucking parasite! I'M NOT HERE TO TEACH YOU, - OR TO MAKE YOU BELIEVE IN ME. - Then shut the fuck up! I don't give a shit what you want, where you came from, or what you're fucking doing here! You can go fuck yourself, asshole. Where are you!? Tell me, God dammit!
