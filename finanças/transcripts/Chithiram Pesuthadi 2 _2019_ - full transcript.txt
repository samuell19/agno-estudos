Yes, dude? –Where is he? Is he inside? Yes, mate, he is inside. –Put the phone down. Beyond this, there is no point talking to me. I built the house as it was my dream house. I can't give it up. –Why must you give it up for me? If you don't pay up in 2 days, I'll take the money myself. Even if you talk hours on end, I won't understand anything. The only lingo I speak is money. Talk using that lingo. You can go now. Priya, are you back? So fast? –Yes, where are you? I'm on my way. Of all days, I don't see any auto around. Look here, Priya, I'll be there. Stay calm, okay? Please don't give excuses, come fast. Come on! Come fast! Where will I look for money... Where will I look for money... Money is God, he went hunting for God... He flew to catch it... Money can do wonders, he did the craziest things for it... Humanity took a backseat... Time did not change anything... No proper way of life... I was always high... Something did not make sense... Girls fought among themselves... No value for self–respect... No place for human here... No God to kill the Asuras... When we have expectation... We stop at nothing... Where to look for justice... If you have money, you are a king... People love money... He thinks hard to save... He inhales poisonous air... He goes looking for death... Money is God... Money is God... Money is God, he went hunting for God... He flew to catch it... Money can do wonders, he did the craziest things for it... Humanity took a backseat... Money is God... Money is God... Money is God... Come, friend. They are Market Ravi's men. Market Ravi? What is he doing here? Only God knows. They've been here for the past 2 days. Let them do whatever they want. Let's mind our business. Let's just stay focused on our work. It's brother. Vanakkam, brother. –Salim, pass the phone to Thiru. Sure. Hey! Brother? –What is this, Thiru? You should have been more careful. –I did it properly. Don't know from where the fool took a peak. It's okay, I'll handle it. Stay there for 2 days. Don't come out till I tell you. Don't do anything, okay? Okay. –Okay, pass the phone to Salim. Hey, here! –Yes? Call Constable Velu. He has the details of the witness. Follow him and get him. If you catch him, kill him. If you can get him, kill our guy. –Brother? Brother? –What else to do? If the witness identifies him, we'll be in trouble. Then why waste time following the other man? He's right beside me, I can do it right now. Thiru is a loyal worker. It's tough to get a man like him. So, if he has the luck, we'll get the other man. Sir, you keep asking the same question. When can I go back? –The officer is asking you. Just answer him. –I rushed towards the auto, sir. The murderer got into the auto with the bloody knife and took off. When I checked, I realised the victim was still alive. So, I brought him in. Period. Can I go now? If you see the murderer, can you identify him? Yes, sir, but I'm afraid to get involved. You should have had the fear before bringing the victim... ...to the hospital. Get me? Salim, where are you? I'm coming. There are many stab wounds on the body. Because he was drunk, he had heavy blood loss. We have done our best. But we can't say anything... ...until we keep him under observation for 48 hours. Okay? Madam, do you suspect anyone in this incident? Sir, can I go? My friend is waiting for me. Okay, you can go. Look here, you can't leave the city. I'll call you at any time for enquiry. Get me? Go on. –Okay, sir. Madam, that is the man who rescued your husband and brought him... ...to the hospital. Listen carefully, white shirt with red checks. That's the man. Here he is. You said white shirt with red checks. Yes, he just changed. –Don't confuse me. This is the man, right? –Yes, handle it. What happened, dude? They killed me with their questions. Please don't ask me anything. –Where do you want to go? Go on, I'll tell you. What happened? –What am I to say? She switched off her phone. –Then your episode is over. Come on! –It is a delicate issue. When you got delayed, she must have cancelled her plans... ...to elope with you, gone home and slept. No matter what happens, she would give me an earful... ...and not switch off her phone. Something happened. What could have happened? –I don't know. This is Entertainment Pandi. In this Kali Yuga,... ...I'm the only one who feels that no one should be a bachelor. Seth, what's the matter? Are you enjoying? Enjoy! Excuse me, may I use your phone for a minute? Let me use first. One minute. Seth, all my girls are sweet. What? Operation failure? No cooperation? Look here, Seth, you are my friend. But I can't refund your cash. I've become decent only recently. Don't turn me into a beast. Dhana! Dhana, why are driving? Get in, I'll tell you. What's in here? –What's in here is not important. How it is going to solve your problem is important. I have a confidential sim in my cell phone... ...that no one can trace. I'll forward all the information... ...in this pen drive to a VIP through MMS. 10 minute after sending it, contact the VIP... ...and tell him the original video is with you. Take whatever money you need from him. Make arrangements to collect the money tomorrow morning. You have to tell him where and what time you want to meet him,... ...don't agree to whatever he says. Do you get what I am saying? Sir, I need a huge amount. I bet you know that. I know. With what is in here, you can demand twice... ...the amount that you want. Here you go. Sir, what is in here? –No, Vicky. It's best you finish this deal without knowing what is inside. Another important thing. Once you make this call,... ...you can't come out of it till the deal is over. What is it? No, I trusted Akash so much. But he cheated me. I didn't trust you. I didn't listen to you either. But you are helping me. Vicky, not only Akash, even I will cheat you... ...when I get the right opportunity. You are solely responsible for your present position. Through this deal, you can solve your problem for now. Until you understand your responsibility,... ...anyone can cheat you at any point of time. What the hell! Mr. Mani, you don't seem to understand. What I'm saying is, Vicky's place..... Hello! Akash! –Nothing, sir. It was my sister. Forget it, Mr. Mani. I have already spoken to Mr. Sathasivam. I'm reminding you because of the situation he is in now. You got the property because of me. Please don't forget that. I've told you the share due to me once the deal is over. Just adhere..... –Akash, you keep repeating... ...what you have already said. If Sathasivam said so,... ...it will take place. Don't worry, Durga, nothing will happen to him. How can you be so sure? Has he done that much of good deeds? If he survives, I wonder how many lives he is going to destroy. Instead, let him die here. What are you saying, Durga? The man lying in there is your husband. Whose husband? Because my father couldn't repay the debt... ...he took from this man, he forced me to marry him. How can I think of him as my husband? Did he call you indecently to sleep with him for a night? He invited the town, arranged a feast for them and... ...married you in front of them. –So? Must I live happily with him? If I want to live happily, he must die here. I know you will talk in support of him. I'm not obliged to listen to you. Hello! –What happened? I said I'll call you. –They need the money urgently. Tell them I'll come with the money. Okay? Sure. This is Guna. His child is in the hospital. Scheduled for a surgery tomorrow, he needs to pay by today. He has come for help too. I have no money, but I know where it is. I know how to get it too. If you come, we can get the money immediately. What are you saying? What to take? Where to take? I don't get it. –We need to rob. You need money, he needs money. I need money too. I know where to get the money we want. If we take it, all our problems will be solved. I'm a professor. –We are police officers. We don't have a choice. Do you have another option? If you have, go ahead. You came here because you didn't have any other option. This is the only way. If you are agree, tell us. Priya is thinking that I will conduct her wedding well. Her happiness is important to me. I'm prepared to do anything for it. My father is ready to do anything for me. I lied to him and stood there waiting for you. What is wrong with you, Priya? I'm telling you,... ...a man was fighting for his life. My only intention was to save him. What about me? I was standing on the road alone. What do you want me to do now? Do you want to elope? Let's go. What for? No need? I've decided to go home. I'll go home and marry the man my father has chosen for me. At least I'll earn a good name. –So, the decision... ...to elope with me is wrong. –Yes, I made a mistake. I fell in love with you and decided to marry you despite the fact... ...that my father hates you. –Fine, you can go. I wish you all the best. –I can't go just like that. What do you want then? –I want my bag back. I can't go home without it. –Why? Because my family necklace which my mother gave me is in the bag. If I go home without it, my family will poison my food and kill me. Okay, what should I do now? –Find my bag for me. Did you hear that? For her to marry a fool,... ...I must go all over town and look for her bag. How do I look? –It's because of you I lost my bag. Look, I'm only responsible for my bag. It is here. You are responsible for you bag. Get me? –God! Can you both calm down? What? –Come here. Why are you fighting with her? –I'm telling her clearly. But she is laying down her condition. Forget it. She is tensed as she ran away from home. She also got scared after seeing those robbers. You tell me, do you want her or not? I don't want her. –She may be a fool,... ...if you miss her, you won't find someone like her again. You are right. –Then listen to me. Go and help her. –Where am I to find... ...those robbers in this big city? –You won't find them. You won't find the bag either. –Then how? That is why I am asking you to find for it. Try to convince her while looking for her bag. Why did you decide to help me all of a sudden? What am I to say? –Please spare me. Look, I'm not responsible for your bag. But you brought it because of me. So, I'm offering to help you. Okay, come on, let's lodge a police report. Why? Do you think I can't do that? I don't want that. That is why I am you for help. –Why not? This area's police inspector is my father's close friend. If I go there, my father will come to know. Then where to look for them? –I know where they would be. What? You know? But how? A man point a knife at me this morning. The fool next to him said this all of a sudden. Come to Kundi Thoppu and ask the people about Senthil and Palani. Then you'll know who we are. Why don't you give our address too? Go and start the vehicle. After we leave, you must forget everything. You have to. If you don't, I'll stab you. Agree? What's that in your hand? Give it to me! Keep walking without looking back. Kundi Thoppu, if we go there, we can catch them. Fine, they would have sold everything by now? Okay! They wait with the bag as they know we'll be coming... ...without selling anything. Happy? Drinks that you love... There is a little intoxication in it... Because there is intoxication in it... Arguments will occur... It will give a good name... It will pretend like a monkey... At dawn... You won't feel drunk anymore... Dull girl is playing hard to get... I'm unable to win that dull girl... Glasses enhance of looks for now... It is going to ensure that we have a tough time later on... Koovam is a river too, but can we swim in it... Love intoxicates too, but can it be like booze... If I pass out drunk, my wisdom will shine bright... Why... Dull girl is playing hard to get... I'm unable to win that dull girl... Glasses enhance of looks for now... It is going to ensure that we have a tough time later on... Why... Why... If you buy a sari from Pothys and make your love grow... Even if you buy a Samsung or Nokia... Even if you hang out together all the time... Even if you propose and make out... Love is just a past–time for women... If you ignore it, your life will be good... Why... Why... I'll smack you of you talk ill about love... If you had met an angel, you would understand... Love won't hurt an empty heart... Even a child know that only rubbish gets collected in it... Why... Why... Why... Why... Do you want butterflies in your heart... Do you want to be successful... You want a girl like Anushka... If you are like Hanuman, you will never fall in love... Booze will only make you drunk for a while, it's not like love... You can achieve with love, so fall in love... Why... Why... Love that starts at Coffee–Day ends in the Tasmac... Only if you have money, love opens its eye... Even if Anushka appears before me, I don't need her... If I sleep for half a day, she'll come on her own... She'll appear in my dream... Why... Why... Like the blue sky... God gave love too... All the boons that you are supposed to receive will vanish... Only love will stay till the end... Just like love, Tasmac is great too... I'm telling you, listen to me... Devadas taught us both... Before him, you are dummies... Why... Why... Why... Listen, whatever we steal, we spend it in government shops. We are martyrs. They should erect a statue for us. Senthil! –Sir, good morning. How are you? –I'm good. What do I lack? What's up? –I need a favour from you. What job, sir? –I need a vehicle urgently. Sir, I left that a long time ago. Can't do that. Trying to be funny with me? I'll pay you. I know you will. –This is not the same. Do the job well this time. –Okay, don't be moved. When do you want it? –The job is tomorrow morning. Deliver the car by tonight. –You make it sound so easy. Today is not possible. –You can do it, I know. Come with the vehicle, I'll tell you what the plan is. Okay, sir. Rubbish, what a living! –You'll say this. Then you'll do the work he says. Shameless man! I'll go and meet the doctor..... –Tell the doctor... ...you'll pay up by tomorrow. Ask him to start the surgery. Go on. Why are you upset? Don't think about what would happen tomorrow. If we do that, what would happen. Just think of that. Be cool. I think the man I wanted to meet is here. This is his car. Let me go and meet him. You are angry with Sathasivam. It's not fair to be upset with me. Please take it. I won't talk about him, happy? You hate him. Then why did you come here? Why are you sitting here for hours? I'm serious. You may go, I'll look after him. It's okay, I'll stay here. I'll stay and get the results. I'm telling you I'll pay you tomorrow. I'll get the money tomorrow, I've made the arrangements. Come on, sister. –If anything happens... ...to my child by then, you had it. –Sir, come on. Let me go. Do you know who I am Police sub–inspector. I'm under suspension, that is why I'm suffering this fate. I'll take charge soon. I'll handle you then,... ...I won't let anyone go. –Don't be angry. Keep quiet. The child's surgery must go on. Let's go. –Or I won't let anyone go. Sir, don't be tensed. I won't tell anyone about this. What do you want? The property that you have. –Which property? Vicky's property. –Do you know what you're saying? Do you know the value of that property? I know very well. I'm not asking it for free. Tell me it's cost. I'm ready to pay you. Ready? How will you pay me? –That's none of your business. Get the documents ready tomorrow. I'll come with the money. But I've agreed to sell it to Lawrence,... ...I even collected an advance. –Return the money back to him. Close the deal. Must I teach you these things? If Lawrence doesn't get it, he'll go to any extent. He must stood down. I am down there. Don't worry about him. This has been my dream. If I let this opportunity go,... ...I won't get a better chance. Get me this deal. Sir! –Sorry, brother, very sorry. Hey! You can speed, but don't drive recklessly. At least when I'm going to see my lover,... ...I can drive myself. Only you would praise your guy. –What's wrong with you? I like him, so I praise him. –Dhanam, no matter what I say,... ...you don't seem to get it. He is not a nice guy. He would do anything for money, be careful. So, can't I love? Dhanam, I know how you started this profession. Entertainment. We don't know what made him... ...choose this profession, and become a thug. I don't know if I will live with him. But he is not a bad guy. I have faith in him. Hey! What are you doing here? I came to talk politics with you. Why, aren't you free? –How do you know I'm here? Maybe the police don't know you are here. But I have good connections. Eat slowly. You are going to get choked to death. What is it? I've been calling you for a long time. Okay, I've answered. What's up? –How long to wait with the stuff? Okay, you want me to inform him, right? I'll tell him. Why are you guys following us? Dismissed! Ravi called. Everything is ready. He is waiting for you. Really? –He is a smart boy. Tell him we'll be there by tonight? –We? You go on your own. Where are you going? –I'm not coming, you go on. Where are you going? –Where will I go? Home. I have work, I'll finish that..... –Listen, I have imported liquor. Come and drink. Let's go. –Even if I go to Kasi,... ...fate will not let me go. Nothing, get in, we'll go now. Boss likes you very much. Wherever he goes,... ...you must tag along. You are great. Hey! Trying to be funny with me? What do you know? I won't tell anyone if he errs, that is the only reason. Sundarajan, who is this? Someone is messing with me without knowing who I am. I will surely kill him. It's Ravi who is calling? –What does he want? Can't he wait? –Okay, I'll talk to him. Here, talk. –Hello! Did you see the MMS I sent to you? –It's him. Put him on speaker. –I have the original video... ...of the clip you saw. I'm ready to give it to you. But only if you give me the amount I ask for. How much? –Rs3 crores. Tell him I'll give him –Okay, when and where? Tomorrow at 10.30 am, the park along Mount Road. Come alone with the money. –But that's a busy place. That is why I picked the place. Get me? Loud and clear. Why did you come here? Why aren't you responding to my calls? Don't you know why? –I told you, didn't I? I'm not involved in what my brother did to you. It's not fair to ignore me because of what he did. Nanditha, please go. –I won't go, Vicky. I'll stay here. –Enough of your concern. That is why I'm facing this now. –Okay, like you said,... ...let me be the cause of this problem. But now, the onus is also on me to solve it. No matter what you say, I won't leave. I genuinely care about you. Don't make it a mockery. Forget about the anger you have on me, focus on your program today. Whose number are you using to call me? No, dad, this is my friend's number. My phone has run out of battery. –Did Swetha's wedding go on well? Yes, it went on well. I met my friends here. They want me to treat them for my wedding. I'm going to take them for dinner. I'll be a little late. Is it okay? Okay, but be careful. –Dad! What is it? –The wedding will go on well. So, relax. Bye. –Sure. So, you don't plan to give me a second chance? Please, don't say anything and confuse me. I'm not confusing you, Priya. You are confused. If this morning, a man did not attack another,... ...I would have come on time. If I had come on time,... ...we would have eloped. If we had eloped,... ...we would be married by now. If we were married,... ...would you be confused? –Did your plan backfire? Brother, just concentrate on the road. We sort out our problem. –I see hundreds of people... ...like you daily. That is why I am saying. Hey, good–for–nothing! Your job is to drive. Just do that. How dare! What did you say? Be respectful. He think he is a big fish and we have to respect him. How can she talk that way? –Am I too much? Your job is to drive. Why get involved in people's problem? Hey, wait! Why is she hitting me? Is she crazy? Crazy? Who is crazy? You and your family are crazy! Oh God! –Don't look, help! Priya, keep quiet! This is a girl. –Where are you going? Here! Let me go! Are you a girl? Devil! Even my wife did not hit me... ...with a slipper. –If I come there, you'll die. Why should I die? The man who marries you is a goner. What? –Sir, you look like a good man. Can you find someone better? You'd better get away from her! Run for your life first. –Go! Leave her! Keep going! You've chased away our ride. How are we to go now? Do you want us to go in his car? He spoke ill about me. Useless! He spoke ill about you. You don't go. Why can't I take his ride? Auto! –Yes, sir? Kundi Thoppu, can you take us there? Sure, get in. He'll take us, get in. That's him, Kathir! –Why did she come here? Hey! Give me your phone. –What for? Give! –Here! Fool, why are you taking my picture? Why are you taking his picture in our area? It's nothing. –Hey! What? –I'll do what I want. Mind your business. –Don't pick on him. If I do, what will he do? –Why pick on me in my area? He has come! Will you pick on us in my brother's area? Give me the phone. –She's a little girl. Let her go. Who is a little girl? –Is that important? Must you know? Brother, give me my phone. –Okay, I'll keep the phone. Go! Take her with you. –Hey! Please keep quiet! It is a Rs20,000 phone. I only paid Rs6,000 for it. I have to pay its instalment. Please give it back to me. –Get lost! He has a knife! –Come on, Kathir! Careful. It's a bad area. What are you doing here? You can tell me if you like. I may help you. 2 men stole her bag. –Great. How do you know they are there? –They are there. I saw one of them there. He ran upon seeing me. Did he see you too? No point looking there anymore. They would have escaped by now. Don't worry. Can you identify him? How does he look? One minute. Give me your phone. It's him. I know him, it's Senthil. He's from this area, I know him. Do you know where he would be right now? We can catch him wherever he is. –Mad guy! So, she came. So what? –Don't, I'll get angry. Will you get angry if I say something? What is it? –You can never be a good thief. Tell me I'm not a good man, I'll agree. But don't say I'm not a good thief. –Let me go. We spent all our money. What are we going to do now? Who said we have no money? Look. –Where did you get this from? It was in the girl's bag that we took this morning. Why didn't you tell me earlier? –I know what you would have done. What would I have done? –You would have gifted it... ...to Dhanalakshmi. Why are you smiling? –Right. Where is Dhanalakshmi? I want to see her right now. I can't see her now. She's with a customer. Once she is done, I'll speak to her and let you know. Call me no matter how long it takes. Okay. I wonder what she sees in him. I want to get married and settle down. What for? –Can't I get married? Be my guest. Marry anyone your like. But you must come when I call you. You will come. I won't go to anyone after marriage. It will only be with my husband. You can do something. Marry me. Then I'll be with you all the time. Go! Why? Are you angry? Are you saying I should not fall in love and get married? Hey, pick up the money and give me in my hand. What do you think of me? Am I begging you? How can you throw the money on my face? Pick it up! Here! Go! –I'll go! Did I come here to start a family with you? Fine, yes, I liked you. But no. How will you accept me as a wife? You won't, right? What do you know about me? Thousands are queuing up for me. My fate, I like you. Why? Because you're an angel? You make a living by torturing people. I entertaining people for a living. No matter how you look at it, I'm much better than you. Bear that in mind. Dhana, why are you leaving so fast? Do you have another client waiting? Move! –Wait! Why are you upset? I'll pay you twice the amount. Don't! –Hey! She is refusing, leave her alone. –Just mind your business. You're pointing your hand! What? I told you clearly not to come here. Brother, they are new. They picked on you as they don't know you. You can go, madam. He is Brother Thiru. He's a tiger. Take him away! Drink, brother. Drink. What happened? You look tired. And your face looks bad. What did he say? –He is not a good man. He is someone who would do anything for money. Pity him, Dhanam. We don't know what made him become a rogue. Don't, I'm already angry. Don't be angry, tell me what happened. He refused to marry me, happy? –Is that all? What is this, Dhanam? Forget about the man who doesn't love you,... ...think about the man who is crazy about you. I mean Senthil. He called, he wants to see you.. God, let me go, I can't. –What is this, Dhanam? He'll keep you beside him and say a few love poems. What is the problem? –That is why I don't want. Pity him, I don't want to give him false hopes. Dhanam, in our business, we must not consider... ...if an action is sinful or a good deed. He knows this will not come true. That is why he is coming after you. Even your rich clients do not give you expensive gifts, but he does. Just listen to him for a few minutes. Hey! –Collection officer is here. You do not come to the station or take care of me. No work over there, brother. Here. Is your problem solved? You can only look. –Take care of me often. Sure. –Who is it? The ICU patient has passed away. I don't want any explanation. It is absolutely ridiculous. You were with him, you're saying you did not notice. Sorry, sir. –Doctor, what happened? How are you related to the patient? –I'm his friend. Okay, nothing to worry. Did anyone go in to see the patient? Yes, doctor, I went in. Why? –Nothing. Try not to go in as far as possible. Even if you go in, don't touch the patient or anything around him. Understood? –Okay. Sister, what happened? –His medicine flow got obstructed. How? –Someone shut the valve. Who could have done it? –Don't know. Someone must have one it, or it could have closed on its own. The doctor is yelling because he feels we were careless. Time to enjoy... Where is it heading too... Heart which will withstand anything... It breaks... Anything that changes is not true... Those with scars will not change... The circle that you see when love blinds you... It is gone when the blindfold is removed... If pain becomes a language... If darkness is light... If this is the only way... We will travel as long as the path takes us... Let's have fun... Let's have fun... A bud that is crushed can still bloom... It is crushed by a force... An instrument that is broken can still produce sound... The damage will not affect it... The people see something else... I see something else... My love will not change... Look at me, girl... Anything that changes is not true... Those with scars will not change... The circle that you see when love blinds you... It is gone when the blindfold is removed... Let's have fun... Let's have fun... Let's have fun... Colours all around us... The sky as far as the eye could see... Without you, there is not me... Can we fly with one set of wings... The colour of the sky... I see a different tone... Won't you change your mind... What else am I asking for... Anything that changes is not true... Those with scars will not change... The circle that you see when love blinds you... It is gone when the blindfold is removed... If pain becomes a language... If darkness is light... If this is the only way... We will travel as long as the path takes us... Let's have fun... Let's have fun... Are you on nights? Me too. It looks costly. –Why do you look at those things? Do you like it? Wear it, Dhanam. It'll look nice on you. Really? –Why are you asking like that? What do you lack? Everything will look good on you. Senthil, I want to leave everything... ...and get married. What do you think about it? Why? Can't I get married? –What do you lack, Dhanam? You can get married. No, keep this as my wedding gift to you. Do you love me that much? Tell me, Senthil. Then fine. Will you marry me? Stop the car! –What is it? Stop! Go on, I'll come on my own. –Okay. What is your problem? Why do you keep following me? What? Are you worried I'll kill him? Mom! I've apologised to you. Then why are you doing this? Dude, Dhanam asked if I'd like to marry her. Look. What I do is bad. –What is this? But you'll do anything. –The fight is serious. That's his car. I'll go and start the car. Push our bike aside and join me. When did you plan it? –When you were proposing... ...to the filth. You said I look like a fool. This is a master plan. –Just go! Mom, help me! Mom! Brother, let me go! I want to go home. I want to see my mother. I'm scared, brother. Let's go. –Let me go. Vicky, please don't do this. –God! Who left the horn here? Hey! Get going! Let me go! Vicky! Let me see. Stop! Stop the car. Palani! –Stop! I think he saw the thief. Why? What happened? He is not going to catch the thief. He is just acting. How do you know? –I'm not lying, madam. He does not plan to catch the thief. Did he say so to you? –Why must he tell me? When you weren't around, he was telling someone. Get in! Who is he? Let me go! Tell me the truth. Do you think I turned off the drip? No, that's not what I think. I won't even think that way. Because it was me who turned it off. I sent the men to kill him yesterday. Today, I tried to murder him again. I'm scared, brother. Why are you watching? Let me go please! It seems there is something important in your bag. If you find it, you'll marry someone else. Is that true? He's not going to find the bag. I know where the thief will be now. If you have faith in me, come with me. I swear I'll catch the thief for you. Have faith in me. Hey! Stop! –Let me go! Who are you? Why are you after me? –You stole the girl's bag. Where is the bag? –Let me go. Why is he fighting here? Let's go! You want him to die. Nothing wrong in that. He should die. We couldn't see eye to eye in business. For you, in life. If he dies, both our problems will end. So do us a favour. Kill him. Don't worry, they have given us 48 hours. If anything happens by then, it will seem like natural death. If things go out of hand, I'll handle it. Vicky, let's go and lodge a police report first. We can't go to the police. –Why not? There is a bag in the car with something that can't reach... ...the police. –What is it? Tell me, Vicky. Hello, Nanditha! Vicky, listen to me. It's good we lost it. We don't need the money. What you earned and saved,... ...everything is gone. That's all, right? Let it go. We are only going to fall down, but we won't die. We'll earn what we want hereafter, okay? What are you thinking? Do you want him to die or not? Okay, go on. I'll handle it. Priya! Look how the old man is guarding the entrance. If I walk in with this, he'll take it and keep it in his safe. So you keep this for now. Dhanam, Senthil is a good man. If you become his wife, you'll have a good life. You know how much I like her. She is asking me to marry her. How can I say no? You tell me. I didn't say anything. –I know you are upset. You know, right? Shut up and work then. Fine, I'll be glad if you are happy with her. Looks like he thrashed you. –Even the car's owner... ...did not hit me so hard. But that guy fixed me good. What happened? –I don't know. She was with me all along. She left all of a sudden. Who is it? Priya? –Her father. Professor? Why is he calling you? She called him once from my phone when we were together. Great. –Say something to him. He'll recognise my voice. –Yeah, you answered... ...all his questions in class. So he knows your voice. Talk to him. –Hello! I'm Priya's father. –Yes, sir? Can you pass the phone to Priya? –She is not here right now. Not here? Where is she then? –I don't know. But don't worry. I'll reach her and ask her to talk to you. Sure. Your name please? –Sir, my name is Sasi. Okay. –Why did you say my name? He hates me. –Why? Does he like me? Forget it, I could only remember your name. I bet. Instead of sleeping at home, I came when you called. I bet you'll remember only my name and not anyone else. Forget it, don't be tensed. –You're supposed to be tensed. Your lover is missing. –I'm not tensed. Nothing will happen to her. I hope she doesn't cause harm to others. Pity the auto man. What happened? Where are we now? Enough, how long are you going to pretend? Why? What happened? What is this? People are saying you're a brave man. Are you really that Sathasivam? I don't even raise my voice in front of you. Are you afraid of me? Are you saying I can't do anything? 5 minutes, everything will be over. Okay? Why are you looking, dude? Don't know who she is? The witness who saw you attack the man,... ...it's his girl. He took off. He'll come looking for her. We'll get him then. Okay? What? Did you get scared? You're no God like you think you are, you're just an ordinary man. Even the greatest man will end up like this one day. No one can prevent it from happening. But there is something that can be prevented. You need to earn bonds who will cry for us at a time like this. Do you have someone like that? If you survive,... ...do you have someone will be happy for you? No one? Then..... Escape, Velu. What was that? Did something sting me? Coffee. What happened? I built this house with love. –Vicky, I know you love this place. Yes, and I will miss it. Okay, I've made arrangements for us to rent an apartment. We'll know that by tomorrow. I've lodged a report that the car was stolen. I said no. –Don't worry, Vicky. The inspector is my friend's brother. If we do not lodge a report because of the pen drive in the car,... ...what if the robbers use it for some criminal activities? We'll be in a bigger soup. Get me? I've also listed down everything that you need to do today. You have done so much work in the morning itself. Yes, you need not worry about anything. I am here for you. –What shall we do now? I don't know. I thought she'll come home. But there has been 25 miss calls from her father till now. I don't know where she went. Who is it? The professor? –No, it's another number. Answer, Priya could be calling from another number. Hello! –This is the inspector... ...from K2 Station. –Police. Police? –Hello! Yes, sir. –Are you Sasi? Priya's father has lodged a report that his daughter... ...has been missing since yesterday. I need to question you regarding the case. Come to K2 Police Station immediately. You must come immediately. –Okay, sir. What happened? –Get ready. We need to go to the police station. We? You need to go. This is your problem. Why should I come along? –Whether I go or not,... ...you have to be there. They have actually called you. What for? Why? –The professor lodged... ...the missing person's report using your name. Why? –Because I gave your name. Get ready, dude, we have to go. Did I fall asleep here? Where is the patient who was here? –We moved him to another ward... ...in the morning itself. –Which ward? Do you think I'm a bad man? –There is nothing to think. You are a terrible person. I know for sure. Not only to me, you've sinned to many people numerous times. You know that too. You're a despicable man who would do anything to line your pocket. Can you deny it? –Why don't you kill me then? Why are you letting me go? You won't get a better chance than this. Just because my father didn't have money,... ...you used that weakness to married me. But the same man taught me that it's shameful to use... ...a man's weakness to defeat him. I believe in it. So I won't harm you here. Once you recover and come home, if I could do anything to you,... ...I would do it happily. You can rest peacefully for now. God! –Hey! I know you're not here to stay guard, but to spy on us. You'd better go. I injected you yesterday. Today, I'll stab you there. Get me? Hey! Tell Manikandan he doesn't have to come here. If he comes, I'll gather the town. Not this way, it's that way. What are you saying? –She made me doze off. What? –Sathasivam's wife. If I stay here any longer, my life will be in danger. I'm leaving, sir. One more important news. He said you should not come here. If you do, she said... ...she'll gather the town and humiliate you. She looks good, right? –Hey! Tell me the truth. Why did you bring her here? What is it, dude? I told you, didn't I? Don't you trust me? Brother, Kathir escaped. So I came back to the lodge. Thiru is here. Shall I kill him? –Forget about Kathir and Thiru. Go to the hospital. Sathasivam has survived. He should not leave the hospital alive. Kill him right there. –Okay. The man you attacked has survived. I'll go and get rid of him. Stay here till I get back. Let her stay here too, okay? If she wakes up by then, don't talk to her. She'll talk and convince you. –What? Anything, dude. She's a lady. Hello! –What is this? You told us... ...to come to the park in Mount Road, but you're going... ...to Egmore with a girl. –How did you get this number? That is not important. The video clip is important to us. Can you give it to us? I know the clip is with you. Not only that, I know where you live,... ...what you do, where you're going now,... ...I know everything. A car is following you right now. What is it, Vicky? –Don't change the plan,... ...give them the stuff. They'll leave you once you give them the stuff. If you don't give them, they'll take the clip themselves. So, get it done and over with. Hey! Who are you? Why did you tie me up here? Hello! What do you want? If you yell, I'll stab you with this. Get me? I'm not going to harm you. Let your lover boy come here. Then I'll let you go. I don't get it. –You need not understand anything. Just shut up. Look here, sir, a mistake has happened. The person I love is called Kathir. He works in a call centre. He's not one who would look for trouble. You have caught me my mistake. –Did he see something... ...that he shouldn't have seen yesterday morning? Yes, sir. He saw someone attacking a man. He took the man to the hospital and informed the police too. We did not make a mistake then. He saw what he shouldn't have seen. He rescued a man whom he shouldn't have rescued. And he even went to the police. There is nothing left to do. Let him come. Till then..... If you had caught me just to catch Kathir,... ...why did the auto man kidnap me by telling me not to trust him? How will Kathir come here if he doesn't know I'm here? If she wakes up before that, she'll talk and convince you. What? –Anything, dude. She's a lady. Who is Sasi? –Traitor. Wait outside, I'll call you later. –No, sir, I'll wait here. Pity him, he hasn't been to a police station. She he is afraid. –He has told you. Go! Professor. –You did not see her thereafter. I swear, sir. Hello. –We are here. Okay, I'm coming. Sir? –Hold him till I get back. Get in! Look where he is standing in his uniform. What happened? Any news about Priya? She is safe, she is with her friends. Get in. How do you know? –I was asking her friend. She is safe. Get into the car. He's good. Let him rest here for a week. Once a medication cycle is over, you can take him home, okay? You need not believe what I say, but I'll still tell you. The job I do, the wicked things I do,... ...I never regretted them. I only did what I thought was right. I had another nature. But that is called selfishness, I realised that only after... ...you told me. The same way, I liked you. I spoke to your father. He agreed. I married and brought you back. But when you smiled just now, I realised that... ...you never smiled as long as we were together. Okay, don't think about anything, please sleep. We'll sort out everything later. He's on the 3rd floor, B Ward. He worries about him. He is still weak. But you must be careful with his wife. She is dangerous, she'll make you suffer. Really? –I've experienced it. We'll see. –That's it. Yes, dude? –Hey, showing me your colour? What happened? –Am I your procurer? Dude, I told you not to talk to the girl. Salim. –Now you found out I lied to you. You do not listen to me..... –Look, Sathasivam's wife. Dude, don't be angry. You need not be a procurer. Just drop it. I'll handle it. –Come, I'll show you. I told you to sit down quietly for some time. What's your problem? –What could be my problem? You are right, Salim lied to me. He brought you here for another reason. You'd better leave before he comes. Go on! Hey! Tell your lover to leave town for some time... ...and not get spotted by us or the police. Go! Mom! That's the house. Do you remember what I said? You only have 20 minutes. Come back to the car no matter what happens. Your daughter's wedding depends on this. Don't botch it. –We're from income tax department. Palani, get their mobiles. –Give me your phone! Go and sit. Give me your cell phone. Who are you? –Income tax department. Please come down, sir. It's good if you cooperate with us, okay? Take him down. Keep an eye on him. –Okay. Palani! I'm under suspension now, that's why I'm suffering this fate. I'll take charge soon. I won't let anyone go. He is under suspension. They are cheats. Wait here, I'll be right back. Where is he? –God! He was there. Fool! Where is your husband? Keep an eye on her. Is this enough for your daughter's wedding? You doing this despite knowing about me? Put it back inside. There goes your daughter's wedding. What happened? –Kill him! Sheila! Is it you? Sir! Gopi! Get in! This is the best place to lose the people who are following us. And then? They know everything about us. I don't think they'll let us go until we give them to pen drive. I think we should go to the police. I think we are taking risk for nothing. It's not that easy. We don't know his influence. And we need to know how involved is Mr. Sulaiman in this. Mr. Sulaiman! Akil! Don't cry, Akil! What happened to your dad? What? 3 men? They are over there. –Catch them. Okay, look after your dad. –What happened? Vicky, nothing will happen to him. Get down. Where is the pen drive? –Pen drive..... No, I can't die for your stupid plan You need not say anything. I know what to do. The pen drive you're looking for is not with us now. But I know who has it. If you come with us,... ...I'll give it to you. Please leave me after that. Carefully lift him. Get into the car. –Don't we have to admit him? They'll handle it. Come on! If we leave him like that, what about his child's surgery? What about your friend's daughter's wedding? We came counting on you, what about our share? You just drove off. –I didn't come here for anyone. I came here for myself. I need not worry about the rest. My daughter is getting married in the morning. I got down into this as I needed money for her wedding. I made a mistake, I shouldn't have listened to Parasuraman. He said it's a normal theft, he killed everyone. Now I don't even have the money. I've only become a murderer. Nothing will happen, sir. Why are you tensed? How can I not be tensed? Parasuraman cheated me. And my daughter too. She left yesterday morning. She has not returned. Parasuraman said she is safe in her friend's house. When I call her now, she doesn't want to answer her phone. I thought I'll go straight to the police station. He said he was questioning someone there. Sir, be patient. We'll find your daughter wherever she is. Don't you and your lover have better work to do? Why get involved in things that doesn't concern you? Just mind your business. –Do you know the girl is there? I do. So what? You had the heart to release me, you should have had the heart... ...to help the girl too. –Are you saying I made a mistake? If you will only pity one person per day,... ...let it be that girl then. Get up! I won't feel proud that I released you... ...or regret for not helping the girl. Get me? Go! I'll go. But if I leave, it's only with that girl. They are terrible guys. That's my problem. I'll handle it. Lock your door and stay safe indoors. Hey! Dispose the car. The door is open. Who are you? –I'm Das, Lawrence's brother. Buying and selling land is our family profession. If you mess with that, do you think we'll keep quiet? Yes, constable –Salim, where are you? At the tea shop opposite the hospital. Tell me. Okay, I want you to leave. –But my job isn't over. No need to do anything, someone killed Mani. What are you saying? Who did that? I'll tell you first when I get more details. I want you to leave now. So what if they shoot Manikandan? Who is that? What is it? –Someone was standing there. There is no one here. I told you to sleep peacefully. I think what you said is true. It is giving me the creeps. I'm not lying, I was busy making money,... ...I didn't have time to think about anything else. Now that I'm lying here, I have time to think. Everything is wrong. But what can I do now? I can't undo my mistakes. Yes, you can. If you know you have erred,... ...as atonement, you can do some good deeds. Atonement. What should I do? Tell me. Give up the money that you earned wrongfully. Right now, in this hospital, many people need money. Help at least a few. Call the office and ask someone to get my chequebook. What are you looking? Call them. Yes? Really? Confirmed? Okay, I'll bring her. What? Are you bored? It's okay. Soon I'll take you to an uncle. If you do what he says,... ...I'll send you home later. Okay? Good girl. Let me go! Let me go! I'm telling you to let me go. Come on. Excuse me. What are you doing here? Who are they? They want what you took from Vicky. Please give it to them. What? What do they want. –They are terrible people. It's only smart to give without a problem. Hey, why should I give the minute you ask? What is this? Let me go. –What's happening? Come on! –Come fast! Hey! They smacked him good. I got him his share. He deserves it. There is a call from the police station. They took everything from the car, including the bag... ...with the pen drive. Where am I to look for it? What? Money isn't ready? Then it is risky. What are you saying? –She had pizza, burger,.. ...apple juice and grew up like a queen. If you will only give her bread, let me know now. Come over here. Drink. Look, money is not a problem. We couldn't get it on time. That's the problem. We'll get it if we try elsewhere. We need to work hard. How can you say things like that... ...and disappoint him. Is it fair? –It's not that, Palani. You and Senthil are important to me. But Dhanalakshmi believes in me. She agreed after I spoke to her. Do you know how much she believes in me? How much? –Hold this. I must get it. –Senthil gave her. She told me to keep it safely. Dhanalakshmi believes in me. I didn't expect you to get so emotional. Finish this. I have the money already. I am drunk. Don't you have to get drunk? You must. I'll go and get a full bottle. He'll ask for money. Drink this! Country fellow! What happened? –Akash who is supposed to marry... ...Priya tomorrow is hospitalised. –Hospital? What happened? Someone went into his office and smacked him. I wonder what other news I'll be getting. Hello! Guna! Where are you? Sorry, sir, I didn't know how to tell my wife. That is why I called you. –No problem. Forget it, let's do what is necessary. What more can happen? Where am I to go for cash... ...for my son's surgery? –I didn't pay... ...for your son's surgery. My husband did it. He is very sick in this same hospital. I only want you to pray for him. What happened? Kamala, I couldn't look for money for our son's surgery. I tried my best. One, please. Vanakkam, sir. What are you doing here? Where did you go before I could come back to the auto? Madam told me to leave, that is why I left. What? –Yes, sir. It seems you were pretending to help. I didn't say so, those were madam's words. She said you were planning for her wedding to be called off... ...by not finding her necklace. Forget it, sir. Girls are like this. –Fine, where did you drop her? The same place where we went in the morning. What happened there? –I don't know. I dropped her and left. You didn't see her after that? –I just told you that. Something is wrong. I botched it when I tried... ...to raise money for the wedding, I went out to rob,... ...my daughter, Priya, is still not back home,... ...the groom got hurt and he is lying in the hospital,... ...there is a reason for this. Or this wouldn't happen to my daughter. Or maybe she's against this marriage,... ...she could be staying at her friend's place. Talking about friends, that reminds me. Hello! Sleep, I'll go and arrange for the money. What are you going to do? –I'll sell this and get some money. That bag? You won't get anything for that. I'll make something. I have to feed her, don't I? Right, I'll come with you. –Why are you coming? You'll go out, must I stay here? I'll come with you. What are you saying? You can't make anything from this. I'll keep her happy. But in haste, I swore to her that I won't steal anymore. So what now? You want money, but you must not steal. I have an idea. If I tell you, you must not get angry. Why would I get angry? Tell me. –Give me the bag. What for? –Give, I'll tell you. Fool! Oh my God! Run, Palani! –Catch me if you can. Stop! Stop! Where are you running? Not me! –Where is the girl? Girl? Which girl? –Don't pretend. The girl who came looking for you yesterday. Where is he? Sir, I swear, I didn't see her after that. Tell me the truth. –Trust me, I don't know. Okay, where is the necklace that was in the bag? Sir, this is a question. But I won't answer you. –Hey! Stop! Move! Stop! Get lost! The necklace is in there. Eat it. What is happening here? There is nothing here. –Fool, he messed up my shirt. Where did you go? –I didn't go anywhere. I was standing right next to you. You ran when you saw him. Why did you run? –Don't ask. He has been chasing me since yesterday. But why? –I stole the necklace... ...and gave Dhanam. He wants it. –Where is the bag? He kept chasing me. I threw the bag at him... ...and told him the necklace is in it. What is it? What is this? Vikram. Show me. –Thank God. Got it! Vicky, one minute. Hey! Thanks, dude. That was a great help. It's okay. Hello. –I'm Sasi's mother. What is it, aunty? –Is Sasi with you? No. –He left his mobile at home. He left this morning, he still hasn't returned. Hey, don't you have conscience? I came with you. Is this how you ditch him? –No, our professor..... I followed him. –Give me my bike key. I told you about my friend, right? He's the one. Hey! –Goodbye to bad rubbish! Hey! This is the auto driver. Sit, what is your name? –Don't touch me, let me go. Nothing will happen, don't be scared. Get lost! Let me go! I'm telling you nothing will happen to you. Come. Take a seat. Hey, pour. The job is done. So we are leaving. Before you go, shall we play? –Sure. There is a beauty inside, do you want to see her? Hey! –Brother? Hey, come on! –Get lost! Sit! Let's play. If you win, we'll leave her here. But if I win, I'll take her. Okay? No matter where you are today, you'll become our briyani. Come alone to the place I said at 10 midnight with the money. Alone. Vicky, do you think he will come alone? Definitely not. –Then why look for trouble? Let's give it to the police. –If we do, will he be punished. Will the girl get justice? –So, what will you do? Here. Who are you? What do you want? –I came to kill your husband. If you are silent, I'll kill him quietly and leave. Look, if you are doing this for money,... ...I'll give you more. I have lots of money, by God's grace. Then what do you want? Ask, I'll give. Once, please. When I saw you, I don't know what happened to me. Do you read me? If you agree, then it's fine. Or your husband..... What is it? You said you're going to run away. Why are you getting dressed? –Yes, I'm going to run. But before that, for the people who like me,... ...one last dance for them. This chariot that moves is a golden chariot... I'm the glittering queen at night, have fun... I'm like toddy that is out of this world... Drink as it is of superior quality... I'm like toddy that is out of this world... Drink as it is of superior quality... I'm coming to seduce all of you... This chariot that moves is a golden chariot... I'm the glittering queen at night, have fun... This is the normal practice, why hesitate... Seduction continues... Excitement spreads all over... I'm like a honey comb in the middle of the forest... You can harvest the honey... Come on... This chariot that moves is a golden chariot... I'm the glittering queen at night, have fun... This closeness between us will last till the excitement is over... We can have fun till dawn... The stars will wink at us... It cheers us... The stars will wink at us... It cheers us... Let's not go wrong... You will look after me, right? –Definitely. Will you stop stealing and go to work? Why do you asking? –For fun. Fine, before we leave, there is something to be done. Tell me what it is. I'll do anything for you. You must steal one last time, for my sake. Take her to the vehicle. –One more game. Sit. You have a copy, right? Why? –Because I won't need it. This thing will end here today. What am I going to do with a copy? Right, we'll end this here today. I hit the jackpot. I won't steal. My mother's. I got it back. You said only one game. –I said I will leave her here... ...only if I win. So, I'm going to play till I win. Not only this girl, leave the other girl too. Agree? You! Where is my Priya? What did you do to her? You want to cut or shall I? –I'll do it. Senthil, come! –They are taking something. Catch them. Catch them! Let go! Let go! Come fast! Let's go. –Hurry! Catch them! –Hurry! Come on! Hey! There is no one else here. It's only you and me. No, we are here too. Sundarajah, I underestimated you. –You thought I was a fool, right? I'm your loyalist. But..... Go, dear. I have a daughter who is 14 years old. Let me go. I will not harm you. You won't harm me. But you'll ruin the lives of young girls. You can keep the pen drive. I'll give you double the amount... ...you asked for. Give it to the police and get me into trouble. If I go to the police, you'll get away. No, please. –What about the little girl? Therefore..... I told you I won't need it anymore. Brother! How much? –Friend, sad he's leaving you? No, sister. He has no money. I don't know where you'll go and do what. I don't know what we will do. But what we have been doing all this while,... ...we will never do that. You called me sister. Did you ever feel like calling me that way before? You only thought of my rate. –No. Then why did you call me that way? Because I am going to live with your friend, right? I want that. I want only that. We'll handle the rest later. Hey! Congratulations. You are right. You're a lucky man. I'm ready to start a new life tomorrow. I'm glad I did not take money for this deal. When I saved your husband yesterday, I lost my lover. Now I saved you, my girl left me for good. Where did she go? –I don't know. The only guy who knew met with an accident outside and died. He behave this way to you, I wonder what he did to my Priya. Nothing would have happened to her. Just watch,... ...she'll come and stand in front of you. Doctor, please help. Priya! Where did you go? Your wedding should go on. Here you go. Why are you upset? Aren't you in favour of this marriage? Your wedding will go on as planned in the morning. But the groom will be someone else? –Who will it be? How would I know? But the professor knows. Wait! Here, talk to him. Dad! Durga, that's another thing that I should give up. The boy is suffering because of it. His number is behind the paper. Call and tell him right now that his property is only for him. Hello, Vicky.
