Many of the activities in the following program are extremely dangerous and must only be carried outunder expert supervision. Please don't attempt any of them yourself. Previously on "BearGrylls Survival School" -- --I met up with the 10 youngsurvivors in North Wales, giving them their first taste of expedition food and surprising them with a tough first challenge. Spend the whole night outin the forest on your own. The girls were pitted against the boys and while the girls team pulled together-- --the boys team fell apart. What are we doing? We need to decide now. Neither team's shelter offered much protection. Two hours to build that. And though the rain held off, it was still a long, uncomfortable night. I didn't sleep very. It was too cold. Team of theday was an easy decision. I'm going to go with the girls. It's got to be the girls. One to the girls, zero to the boys. I'm Bear Grylls. When I was growing up, allof this was my playground. I want to find out if kidstoday have got what it takes to abandon their mobile phones, survive for two weeks out here in the wild. Woo! Look out. I really don't want to do this. Dig deep. Finish strong. Welcome to "Bear Grylls Survival School." Coming up-- Starts off slippy. Hands out there, guys. --tackling treacherous terrain. Whoo-hoo! Cold? Yes! And taking on a powerful waterfall. You can do it. I really can't. What happened inlast night's survival exercise in many ways is no surprise. As we've gotten more advanced, life has become easier, and we've lost a lot ofthose ancient survival skills that our ancestors took for granted. So what we're going to dowith these young people over the next 12 days, we'regoing to be teaching them everything they need tosurvive but not just to survive when it's all sunny and easy. We're going to teach them howto survive when they're tired, they're cold. They're beaten up. They're fatigued. They're hungry. Can they do it then against the odds? So first up today, a crash course in the basics of survivalfor my team of experts. Top of the list-- the rule of threes. Just how long can you lastwithout the basics of life? Well, rule of threestarts with three minutes. What can you not survive-- Three minutes without air. Yeah, three minutes without oxygen. What about the next one, three hours? Three hours without shelter. Yeah, without shelter. Warmth. You have to keep warm. Otherwise, you get hypothermia. Yeah. A lot of people will putthat after work and food. But without shelter, in an extreme environment, you are a goner. So we've got minutes, hours-- Three days without water. Three days without water. Perhaps surprisingly, you can last for aroundthree weeks without food. Next lesson-- learning how to cross difficultterrain, like treacherous rocks and rivers. Starts off slippy. Remember, hands out. This is going to be hard, this one. You're halfway. A triangle of three people is much more stable for crossing a river. But they won't always be ableto see where they're going. You can do it. Keep coming. Cold? Yes! Going into water that waslike really cold and, like, it's hard to cope doing all this stuff. But the sense ofachievement is really good. 14-year-old Charlie is keen to learn all he can about the world of survival. Hey. What's up, guys? My name is Charlie, and you're watching this-- He's much morehome in the virtual world of the internet. --videos. Today, I'm going to be telling you five things we all do on YouTube. Let's get on with the video. The reason I wanted toapply for survival school is because I sit inside a lot. I play games. I edit videos. I film. And I wanted to getoutside and test my skills and challenge myself. Alongside his YouTube channel, Charlie's other great passion is magic. Anywhere I will go, I will take my cards. I have my own business cardsprinted, my own website. - You take out the card. - You this card. Remember it, yeah? The reaction is amazing for me. It's definitely made me a lot more confident. Six of diamonds. Six of diamonds. Charlie is veryself-assured for his age, and he hopes he'll be ableto help others on the course. I think it's definitely goingto change me for the better and make me a more caringperson, a more outdoors person, More considerate, yes. We'll let you know. Help each other. Three of you, go, go. Already, several of the team are leaning on them for support. One. It's a packed survival school morning with classes andeverything, from tying knots-- Was it like this? Oh all right, yeah. Then you go up, around, down. Yeah, let's try again. --to using knives safely. This is a fixed blade knife-- super strong and super helpful. Your thumb-- Yeah? --is to go back a bit. Knives arealso super sharp and deadly. And a key danger zone is what'sknown as a triangle of death around your thighs. I went like that, cut down, I might hit a femoral artery. So what we do to make it super safe-- solid position on the knee. And we're cutting away. The femoral arterycarries blood to your legs. And if damaged, you can quickly bleed to death. Guys, we are solucky to have Joe with us. One of thesurvival school support team, Joe Humphrey, has a chillingstory to highlight the dangers. Hi, guys. I think you've all met me already, haven't you? Yeah. He was shot in his femoral artery when he was serving in the Royal Marines. Three years ago was in Afghanistan, and I was leading a team in a firefight. And I got shot in my leg. There was blood spurting sixfeet out in all directions. And the surgeons actually operated on me in the helicopter. One of the doctors even whowas the same blood type as me did a transfusion straightfrom his body into mine. The heroic actionsof the doctors saved his life. But sadly, they couldn't save his leg. I had to have myleg amputated through the knee. So that's just an example of what may happen if you stopthinking for a millisecond when you're handling these knives. It's quite a reality check for the young survivors. As Joe says, you've got to, got to be safe. You've got to be concentratedwhen you're using a knife. The doctor did thesurgery on the helicopter. That would have been really hard. And like the blood, like, in the helicopter as well. Yeah, but theyneeded to risk everything, didn't they? The morning's lessons have come a little late for Adam. He's already broken one ofthe basic rules of survival. I've just got a really bad headache. I haven't drunk much water for the past day. Survival school medic Nick Marshall checks him over. He's been sweating. He hasn't been drinking enough. So he's been feeling a bit faint. So we're giving him some rehydration sachets in his drink, which he's going through now. And he's starting tofeel a little bit better. Headache? Yeah? Get some water down, yeah? And Adam's not the only one. Charlie is also showing signs of dehydration. Just getsome water down you, mate. Well, having two guys being treated at the momentfor dehydration is hopefully a sobering reminder for the rest of the group how important it is inthe wild to keep drinking. Once you get dehydrated or you start to get heatstroke or sunstroke, it becomes so hard to fight your way back from that. Water in the wild is one of top, top priorities. And these guys arelearning it the hard way. All the team will need to be best for what I've got in store this afternoon. I'm going to take them into freezing cold water to climb a powerful 20-meter high waterfall. It'll test their guts anddetermination to the limit. see that waterfall. I can't wait. It looks cold. No, it looks cold. They'll be learning a vital skill I've used to scale everythingfrom vertical cliffs to the world's highest mountain. The way we are going to get up this is exactly the same techniqueas I used once on Mt. Everest. It's called jumaring We're going to swim out to the base of the roper. We're then going to clip that onto the rope. That will allow the jumar to go up, but it won't be able to come down. OK? So we start the climb. We push it up. We hang on it. Climb a bit more. We push it up. And we hang on it. This water is very cold. When you get in, it's going to hit you. It's going to feel wow. But we use that adrenaline. What we don't want to bedoing is still trying to climb up this rope after 15 minutes. Because then you start to lose your feeling in your fingers and your toes. And everything becomes much harder. I'm incredibly nervous. I don't know what it is. I think it's the fact thatthe rocks are so thin. I want to try, but I'm really scared to. I'm a little bit nervous, but my knees aren't like shaking at the moment. But I'm just like-- I'm more scared of the cold water. For those of you who are a little bit more nervouswith water or heights, work hard. Remember, I said the best way over your fears is through them. Whoa, it's cold. Come on! Come on, man. Oh man, look at that. Whoo! OK, so you can see the rope is slippery. The rock is slippery, OK? You don't want to slip and hit your face. Once you're up here, you'reup, climb out to Stacey. He's actually gonna jump. Oh my god. Let him jump. You know what I'm gonna sayis you guys are gonna love it. OK, Bailey, yeah, go for it. Tim, take him in. OK, Scott? First up to take on the torrent is 13-year-old Bailey. Freezing. push up your hands. The hard bitis when you're suddenly out of your depth, you're atthe base of the waterfall, is all that cold air thatthe water brings down. You can do it, buddy. You can do it. You can't hear anything. You're trying to find the rope. You're trying to get clipped in. You can, buddy. You can do it. Focus on what you're doing. Be determined. But just prepare yourself thatit is a bit crazy in there. Yes, Bailey! Come on! Come on, Bailey. It's OK, Bailey. You can do it! Keep going up that line. But he'sstruggling to get the hang of the jumar technique. Come on, Bailey. Watch out! The water was freezing, and then it just kept on smacking my face. Bailey. I smacked my head against the rock. Whoo! Come on, Bailey. Fight through! You can do it! This is whyit is difficult-- slippery, it's cold, there's all that craziness-- that wind, that noise. And then, you start to get fatigued, and then you get a little bit scared. In that moment, just remember this-- keep going. Keep going. Come on. I had these kids on a safety rope, so if the kids were struggling a little bit, I could just put a tiny bit of assistance on. Bailey is running out of energy and getting very cold. And Scott has to help haulhim up the final few meters. Great determination. When he got to the top, his face just said, oh, he's in absolute bits. You OK? Fine. Yes, all right? - Yes, Bailey! - Yeah. Just freezing. I need to get warm. Next up is Maria. You feeling all right? A bit nervous, but yeah. OK, go for it. Lots of encouragement, guys. To succeed, she'll need toconquer her fear of heights. It's a key reason the 14-year-old Londoner signed up for survival school. I want to change how scared I get of things. Uh! How do you think I'dcope in like a really small cave that's full of water-- Oh, no, no. --and it's dark. You'd probably start having a panic attack. I don't like confined spaces that much, and I'm not liking the dark. I'm afraid of heights, spiders, most bugs. But like, you're going to give everything a go? Yeah, definitely. And she's determined to get over her fear of climbing up high. You know, if you're all, like, got a harness on and everything and just you know you're safe, I'm just always scared something will go wrong, and I'll just fall to my death. Ah. There's no better moment for her to push through her fear. All right, how do I use it? Push up, like he said. Oh my god. Ah! Well done. Push up. And lean back. Keep going. You're doing awesome. If Maria'snervous, she's not showing it. That's it. You can do it. Push up. Keep going. Nicely done. Remember when I told her about calm in the storm, thinking clearly under pressure? This is the sort of thing I mean. Maria's technique is amazing. It's as if she's been climbing for years. When I first started climbing, I did kind of start thinking, oh my god, if this breaks, I'm going to fallbackwards into the rocks. I started to freak myself out a bit. Keep working hard. Pull! It was so cold that-- I'm not joking-- I literally had like a t-shirt on, and it was absolutely freezing. When the cold starts to bite, everything becomes harder work. That's why I say use those golden few minutes of that the adrenalin, thatfear to get you up there. Well done! Come on! Maria storms itto the top in just two minutes. I honestly thought Iwouldn't be able to achieve it, but I'm really proud ofmyself that I got to the top. Well done, Maria! Come on! Each day, my leaders decide whether overallthe boys or the girls team has done the best, and the survivors are determined not to let their side down. Bear made it look so much easier than it was. One by one, they rise to the challenge. I'm really happy I've done it. You know, I might-- I might go and do it again. Savannah is terrified and starts to panic right at the start. Savannah, you can do it. - I really can't. - You can do this. You can do this. - I can't get up. I can't even get up. But she succeedsin overcoming her fear. You've got it! It was awesome. It was so hard. I'm unbelievably. There's not a smile big enough for it. I just climbed a waterfall. Wow. Well done! Whoo! Adam has even more to prove. It's less than two years since he had a metal rod put in his back. I was born withsomething called scoliosis. It's the curve of a spine. My spine is kind of like a backwards C. I got a titanium rod put intomy spine to make it not as bad. People treat me like I'm in-- I need to be wrapped up. I can see that I can do everything else can perfectly fine. Having broken myback in a parachute accident I know a little of what he's going through. I know you're a little bitmore nervous about heights. As I said, it's great. It's fine to be nervous of things. It means you're human. I'm exactly the same. I still find skydiving reallyhard after I broke my back. Are you feeling OK with it? Yeah, definitely. I think it'll be-- it will be hard, but it will be good when I get to the top. Yeah. You're going to be aninspiration for so many people. Of that I am certain. Come on, then. How are you feeling? There's not really pressure. It's just that I kind ofwant to make it up for myself now just to prove it that I can. Sure. Here we go. - Come on, Adam! - Hold on. That's freezing. I went in the water. The adrenalin just hit me, and it was just a rush of just pure energy. It was absolutely mental. On the bottom of the rope, I was fully prepared togive him a bit of a hand, but I really didn't need to. He's so strong. Well done. Yes! Well done, Adam. I was really scared, becausel've got a fear of heights. But when I started going up, I just totally forgot about it and just did it. Adam is all the time, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. What a legend. He got straight on thatjumar technically perfect, physically great. Your body is just sapped of energy. That takes all the energy out of you. Yes, boy! Come on, Adam! Let's go. Adam powers tothe top in just over a minute and a half, the fastest of the entire team. Adam, Come on, lad. Well done, Adam! You all right? I think I did actually quite well. I think I climbed that thefastest possible I could, so I'm happy with myself with that. I really didn't think I'ddo something in my lifetime. What a starand a complete inspiration. The team are tired but happy as they settle in for that first night in base camp. They'll be sleeping herein tents every other night throughout the expedition. And because they've had such atough start to survival school, tonight I'm giving them all the ingredients for a filling supper. It's like chicken and like vegetable stew. Have we got ham and cheese? Actually, I'm really happy. I'm really enjoying myself. It's-- we're in a different camp tonight. We've got tents and fire and food. But not everyone'sin such good spirits. The two youngest boys, Bailey and Asriel, are starting to feel homesick. Yeah, I thought it was goingto be a bit easier than this. Yeah. I'm missing home. I'm missing my family pretty much. You'll see them soon, I guess. They'll all be there just waiting for you. I just can't wait to go see my family again. If I feel sad because I'm the youngest, they laugh at me, or-- that's it. I can see in Asie'sface that he wasn't himself. You know when a voice cracksor like tears well in his yes, I could see it. Take care of that fire, guys. Expedition leader Tim decides to take Asriel to one side. You missing home? No. No? Do you think-- do you think it would be nice to see people at home? All right? Yeah? Hey, come in here. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. You're doing fantastic, all right? He's the youngest here, and I think it's going to be the hardest for him definitely. Homesickness is incredibly common at this early stage of an expedition. I'm really proud of you. Yeah. So high-five. Well done, OK? We have come to the end of our second day out here in the wild. How is everyone doing? - Great. - Good. - Fine. - Tired. Sore muscles. It's time forthe vote for team of the day. And at the moment, it's 1-nil to the girls. Today, it's pretty tough. You've been very close neck and neck. I think today the boys have got it. I think the boysmade a massive improvement. For me, improvement is on the way to victory. Boys for me as well. I'm going to have toagree with both these guys actually. So well done, boys. Well done, boys. Well done. At the end of each day, there'll also be a vote forthe best young survivor. The catch is that it willbe the team themselves who have to decide the winner. I want everybody togive a name of someone who you think deserves to be survivor of the day but also a reason why. Adam, we're gonna start with you. I would probably say As because he was helping a lot of people so I pick him. Cool. Lovely. Probably Savannah becauseshe, like, carried on going. Nice. Courage. Like it. I'd say Charlie. Because even though he had a headache, he carried on and didn't wimp out. I'd say Keegan because one thing, he had the poorest sleeping bag last night. Tara, because today shewas like camping everyone and supporting everyone. Tara, what about you? I was going to say Liv. You just toughed it out. And I think-- I think she was just being areally good survivor today. With six votesfor six different survivors, it's still anyone's game. Next up, Asriel. I vote Charlie. He was helping with thewater, Charlie, pull you out. I was going to say Charlie aswell, because I kept slipping and, like, falling. So he was like helping everyone out. So that was really nice. I'm gonna say Asbecause he's like struggling a bit, but he's carrying on. Adam because he's been a trooper today. Like, he's got through everything when he's had like a bad back. And he's done well with everything climbing up. Cool. Guys, great answers, OK? Charlieedges it with three votes, becoming my very first survivor of the day. Everyone giveCharlie a round of applause. Well done, buddy. I was really pleased thatpeople were saying my name. Because it made me really feel good inside that I've, like, shownthem that I can be helpful. It was a really, reallynice thing for them to say. Next time on "Bear Grylls Survival School," tempers flare in camp. You can't just think about yourself. We get punished. We're a team. Mealworms on the menu-- Get it down. Ugh. --and a star turn from Asriel. Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on. You need to get--
