Come on April, don't make me beg Saturday is going to be a big party in the city I would like you to come I don't waste my time with the boys. Your place is in the playground. Why do you think she's so stuck up? Maybe she likes girls. Forget her guys. I have a good news. In this afternoon there will be a new chick Tell us about her Robert? That's all I have on her. Miss Baker told me when I went to see her this morning Yeah we have to break in the new chick - Oh yeah! - Okay Not bad, uh? Okay guys. Training stops. It's going good Hmm you know the teacher may have been right, But I think we got something we could shoot a whole lot better with What are you thinking about? - I know what he thinks about! - Oh yeah... I almost forgot, Rachel: I promised at the Dean if you usher this new girl around the school We can't go swinging with the boys Did you know, the club is like that, they need a lot of money. let's go I don't mind Everybody take advantage of me. I'm sick of this. Everyday the guys go for April, and here comes this new girl Vicky. Probably a spoiled brat. - Hi, I'm Rachel, you must be Vicky? - Yes, hi Rachel I hope we can be friends You never know how can happen let me - Let me help you - Ok thanks There! She's fine! Baby! Baby I need you! All guys are idiots... What happens with that girl? They can't make working their mind? Okay everyone. You know that soon there will be a test and that is why you should workout and anyone with a special workout they should start in the weight room Well I have an idea: why don't we all go on our workout? The others probably went swimming I'm interested in everything about her Angela, she was the main force of the guys but now the guys are paying more attention to Vicky No, not like that I'm so excited Steve. Last time I was also excited, when I was a kid I went with my brother to climb the mountain but this is different. - Sorry Vicky, it's only me - Don't be so stuck off Steve, let's keep going - Okay What's wrong April? None of your business. You want to know, since this little Vicky is here every guy is beating on her Yes well with her at least I could probably get a good fuck but with you we've been trying to get you in bed for two years and no one's got lucky yet. Or am I wrong? No you're wrong because I'm waiting for the right one that will marry me You'll die a virgin. no one's want to marry you or engage with you until they get you in bed know how you are She's so dumb. So fine. This Vicky is very interesting Watch ou Steve! Where did he go? Did he fall? This is your fault! Instead of paying attention to climbing he's looking at your ass. Let's not talk about this Show me what happened You are lucky it's not that bad Did you check here? It hurts a little bit Here? A little bit more - Maybe here? - Yes, better - Then... it may be... here. - Yes We got the permission to take Vicky at Rally Racing The question is: which one of us? Oh perhaps we should draw matches that will be the fair way to do it You are right Okay guys have you got any matches? Let's see Let's see. I will take the head of some I will stay the same, we'll go in line I will be We'll go in line. I will be the last. Whoever will get the match without head get to take Vicky Lucky bastard Don't worry guys you will get later on That what is very fine okay Hey, check the tire pressure also Let's go baby For Vicky, she sure knows a lot about cars I hope her car will throw her You are a fucking asshole April Come on guys, we'll be late for volleyball match you didn't tell me you can drive like that I was a junior champion a couple of years ago Ah, that's why it's so easy that's why it's so easy Can I give you a big hug? - You don't want to hug me! - What do you mean? You know I've never did it on a race car before It would be very weird to do it here but I've nothing against it (very funny...) (yeah as you know him) Hello girls So which one of you girls wants to come jet skiing? Maybe you Rachel? I don't feel like it Only three jets. I will stay here. - Okay but no horse plan! - Stupid! What's up? Something wrong? What did you say? I've asked what is the problem? With me? Nothing. It's like you are in a different world Oh. I doesn't think April likes Vicky. They're almost the same because for two years, didn't get none That's enough of this! Everyone is talking about little virgin April and crazy sexy Vicky What's her problem? What's wrong with her? I don't know. Maybe she's just... Ah. The reason we came back here, we ran into Maggie on the way back and we thought we put together some hot sex action together - It's a good idea - yeah - I think we're going to have some fun - Yes Look at this, men - Ah, there are jetski - Yeah, that's gonna be fun Come on Pete, let's do a race - Okay let's go - Me too Take one of the jet skis Take one You should pick this Mylar, Vicky Don't (...) then we go this way. Take this Mylar I would like to talk to you Steve Now? About something concerning school? No, what I want to talk about is different I'm listening - Not here, in the house - Okay Now you can tell me This is so embarrassing, Steve I know that you have been trying to get with me and I've been shutting you out and everyone else The only reason I did this is because I never did it with anyone and I was scared You're a virgin? this is not important but I feel alone Since Vicky has been here at the academy everyone has been paying attention to her and I can't handle it so I want you to fuck me Are you kidding? Does this convince you? Wow, I can tell you're not joking Come on, do something If you want to What happened? Something hurts? Yes, my... my ankle You should go to see a doctor, it could be broken What happened? Vicky rolled over, someone sabotage her jet That's probably April, because she hates Vicky What do you have to say? You're joking? You think I could do something like this? You probably did this to be back in the spotlight I would never do anything like this Maybe she's telling the truth Of course I'm telling the truth well I have a different feeling Maybe we'll go back out and you can try the other jet skis Why not - And Sue? - Of course - Rachel? - Why not Good. Then we can go into race We'll go down there to that point and turn around and come back since you have the smaller boat, Rachel you can have a 10-second head start Here is the key What's the matter Rachel? You're scared? Maybe April did it I wouldn't start it you're the one who sabotaged it Not true If I remember at the start you told Vicky to take the small boat or do I remember wrong? What do you say? For once, think. You all are fucking assholes and I hate this story and school anyway How did you know, Eric? I'll tell you at school once Vicky gets back from the doctor we'll have a big party May I have your attention ladies and gentlemen this afternoon we will cleared up that accident what happened today and from today Rachel Stern is suspended because she took responsibility for what's happened. And teachers got together and everybody came up with the idea that we go and shoot party (Yeah) And I suggest you use your opportunity while the teaching staff go in a city so starting Monday is back to work Now you can tell us how you knew Rachel did it Well I didn't it was just a gut feeling When Steve and the girls left to go mountain climbing I saw Rachel do something to Vicky's rope and when I questioned her about it she became defensive if her little plan had worked, April would have been expulsed from school and Vicki may have been killed Nice job Eric Does your leg still hurt? Not anymore The main thing is that we cleared it up with April I was going to say the same about Vicky because because she made me understand why sex is such an important thing I am happy. What but do you think people? Let's have a big party Let's have a big party!
