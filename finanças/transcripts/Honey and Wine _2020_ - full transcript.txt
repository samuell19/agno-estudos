a beautiful girl and uh i'm sorry that i'm used to hearing those horrible things yeah but i guess i'm used to it it's just people feel so free to do it you know it's so weird that in this world of feminism there's just so many women who are so quick to judge other women for expressing themselves how they only wish they would have the courage to do this just themselves and you know some of us we're just free of living out our urges while the others just are pushing them down deeper in their beings living their lives suffering really sad don't you think yes it's a deep i guess i'm more than i look oh well i mean this is exactly what i was talking about i mean what i hoped we could do is have conversations like this intellectual conversations yeah and uh yeah i find it fascinating um that i mean your profession and what you do and and uh of course there's a lot of judgment i think right around um what you do can i ask you a personal question yeah sure okay well i hope it's not too personal how many men have you been with i don't look at it that way i mean how many coffees does a waitress serve in a day [Music] a lot it's the same why are you laughing so you don't keep count not

job well it's not what it wasn't a dream i had to be doing this obviously but yeah i guess oh sorry it's okay um i guess the money is what has kept me here i can relate yeah yeah um but i had dreams i had something else in mind that i wanted to do like what was that well i actually came to london to become an actress and that was my dream to be in front of in front of the camera and be in movies and then and then shows and be famous people would know my name well i know that's a competitive industry but it's never too late at this point i feel like it's way too late for me i lost my chance well how did you get into what you do well it's not like i had had to because uh to be honest with you i come from a well-off family and my family does have money and i could have worked with my parents in their company but i've never been like them i've never been interested in what they are and i like to be independent and make a life of my own you know and i came here to pursue my acting and that didn't work out obviously and this is what i'm stuck with and now it just feels like i can't escape it anymore i feel like i'm supposed why why do you feel like that well it's not an industry that you can just get out of now there are people like yvonne who are always on your neck and i owe a lot of money and i can't just run away and start a different life you know sorry i was listening to buzzkill not i'm interested i asked because i was interested and yeah and uh [Music] well i still don't yeah i still understand why why you feel like you have to do this surely there are other things you can do there are other ways to make money right there are but as i mentioned i can't just run off and start a life why not because there's a lot at stake okay i i have involved myself with people who know where i am and so leave go somewhere else and be whoever you want to be can't sleep why i'm sorry i'm crying you don't need to tell me if you don't feel comfortable no i do feel comfortable with you and good okay there is a reason why i'm here in this situation and it's because i have a child you have a child yeah and i was in love once thank you with a man and he made sure that once he knew what i was involved in he he took my baby and i lost the custody and and i can't see her anymore and i haven't seen her in two years and she's growing and i'm missing everything in her life and he has a job he has a home and he can provide for her but i i can and i want to i really do because now her she's not a baby and i need the money i need to provide for her so i am doing this because it pays well and eventually i will save enough to take her with me and we can get an apartment outside the city and just be a family again but until then i just i can't i can leave i'm stunned you do listen i've got a feeling things are going to get better you really think so i do it's a fresh start yeah it's fresh starts ah the food was okay yeah thank you for the dinner was really nice you're welcome my wife's cheating on me oh oh i'm so sorry oh have you confronted her about it no within so you're just staying in the marriage knowing she's cheating on you and well i mean i'm not a hundred percent but i'm well [ __ ] you should i know that she's i know yeah she's did you caught her no i'm i'm not holding a candle to her and whoever she's with i mean i'm i'm away from home a lot and i you know i i heard something on the phone earlier and sort of was uh confirming suspicions that i already had well steve you should you should call her now and just i mean you know that you should hold her and say well like tell her tell her that you know tell her what you think about her like nah so you can't just live in some kind of illusion that something everything is going to get better like you need to you need to call her really what's it gonna what's good what's it gonna achieve for me it's gonna it's gonna go out allow you to to move on and then what you're gonna move on and then we get a new life my kids are children there are so many divorced couples that are co-parenting or split the custody like whatever but you no one should ever live in a marriage that's not truthful and based on love call her call her i can't leave knowing that you're not going to do anything about it sorry but at this point i care too much about you and call her call her now take your phone call her now call her now take your phone take the phone you know what [ __ ] it i've been wanting to do this anyway yeah just put it on speaker hello hello hi hi i i got it who is this steve hi
