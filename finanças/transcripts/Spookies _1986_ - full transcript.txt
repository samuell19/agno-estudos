Darling Isabelle. I can wait no longer. The final foolish victims will be here very soon. And then once again, we shall be together for all time. I told you we shouldn't have followed him. First, he starts a fight at that party, gets us all thrown out, embarrasses the hell out of us. Now, he gets us lost out here in the middle of nowhere. What a jerk! Would you slow down, Duke? You know he doesn't know these roads like you do. You do know these roads, don't you? Later for you, Mars. So here's to you, Billy. Happy birthday. So Billy, today's the big day. First night away from home, kid? What makes you say that? You just seem kind of nervous. I'm not nervous. You just startled me. Give an old man a light. So how old are you, kid, 12? 13. No, you're not. I am so, today. Yeah? Take my advice, kid. Go home. No way. I have plans, big plans. Yeah, sure. Everybody's got big plans. Yeah, well, some of us have plans that are gonna work. Right, right. So why did you leave your folks anyway? No reason. Your folks forgot your 13th birthday. What makes you say that? Listen, I have a long road ahead. I guess I'll be seeing you. Maybe. Maybe. At last, for 70 years, I have waited. I have sacrificed the youth of so many so that you might live. And yet, I would trade all my powers for some way to make you see how helplessly I love you, that I even kill so that you might live. What a cruel joke. My power is nothing compared to the power your beauty has over me. I am your prisoner, a slave to that which I can never possess. Hey, watch your god damn beer on the upholstery! Then watch the god damn roads and stop complaining! Yeah, Duke, watch them roads. I'd like to try to have a couple of more beers, I mean, before I'm splattered across the landscape. At the moment, I'm much too sober to appreciate it. That's weird. No name. Can't be any colder in there. Hey, Duke, where are you taking us anyway? Come on, you guys. The night's a long way from over, man. I'm looking for another party. Me too! Oh no, is he starting with that thing again? Uh-oh, Duke's mad now, mook. Well, what do you say we kiss and make up? Huh, Duke, what do you say? What, are you queer or something? Jesus Christ, now, what's he doing? God damn branch! A friggin' tree. Get over here and help me with this, huh. What the hell are you trying to do, kill us? Jesus. Lift it up. Let's go. So what happened, it just fell? No, it grew there. Listen, Duke, we've been driving around for two hours in circles and getting nowhere fast. All right, let's get out of this place! Wait a minute, what are we doing now? We're partying, man, something you're too old to appreciate, huh? Hey, if any of you people want to have some fun, come with us. This is ridiculous. Do you even know where you're going? Yeah, I'm going nuts 'cause I gotta stand here and listen to you. You're the one that got us here. See you at the party. Peter, forget it. Let's go. Hey, you can go home if you want to. I ain't gonna cry about it. Just shut up and let's go, Duke. Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Boy, I could definitely have my own room here. Cool. Happy birthday Billy from all of us. Hey, a surprise party. So you didn't forget after all. This is really great. You can come out now. Okay, so you want me to cut the cake? Funny. Ha-ha. Hey, that was really neat. Happy birthday, Billy. Billy. Mom? Dad? Are you out there? What's this, a bowling ball? So you want me to open it or what? Okay, I'm opening it. Happy birthday, Billy. Come on, what are you guys, dead? Do you know where we're going, Duke? Sure, right here. This doesn't make any sense. I mean, who would build a house in the middle of a graveyard like this? Might have been the other way around. Yeah, but still. Hell of a way to fertilize your lawn, eh? What the hell are we doing in a place like this? We're gonna get in trouble if we hang around here. This has gotta be private property. Don't stay. Just leave the trouble to me. So old. We can't dance around here all night. Let's go. Somebody might be live here. I don't think anyone lives here. No one lives here. It's empty. She's right. There's nobody here. Come on, people. What are you, afraid of the dark? Oh boy, here we go. Yo, wake up! Yes, I always knew you would. Duke, don't go in there. Why not? Because you don't just go barging uninvited into people's houses, especially deserted, crumbling old houses in the middle of the night. There's nobody in here. Come on. Yeah, what could happen? Welcome, fools. Let's go join the others. Come on, Meegan. It's spooky as hell inside. We're coming. I like this house. It's so weird that the lights work. Maybe somebody does live here. Somebody does live here forever. I think I'll go get me another one. Oh, excuse me guys. I wasn't looking where I was going. I'll be a little more careful. Oh, Adrienne. Hello, how are you? It's good to bump into you too. Hi, Dave. How's your sinuses? Oh, dukey, Linda. Why don't you watch you're going, idiot? It's funny, I grew up with these people. Carol, what's wrong? I don't know. I don't feel well. Do you want me to get you something? I'll be all right. I just want to be alone for a moment. Come on, honey. Let's dance. No, leave me alone. I don't want to do nothing. Listen, kids, I'm sorry. He just gets like this sometimes. Blow, pal! Thanks. This time, we must play the game perfectly. When all of the pawns have been sacrificed, we will win our queen back again. Look at it. Isn't it wonderful? It's pretty god damn weird if you ask me. What is it, art or something? You think it's worth any money? What the hell is in here? Cut it out, Duke, now! That's a bright idea. Why don't you try breaking a few windows too? Hey, listen. Quit your crying. Nobody cares about this old creep joint and why should you? There's something in there. What are you, crazy? Nah, it's just an empty closet. Adrienne! What are you laughing at? It's a dead man. This thing ain't real. This ain't no dead man. Go on, touch it. What are you, crazy? I'm not gonna touch it. Come on, touch it. Looks real to me. Come on, mister. You ever see a dead man like this before? Look at that face. It's some jerk's idea of a gag. Oh, scary, I'm shaking. What's that it's got on its arm? What's this supposed to be? Looks sorta like a parcheesi game or something. I know what this is. I mean, I've never seen one like this before. It's a ouija board. Ouija board? That sounds stupid. Hey rich, this must belong to you. But there's something missing. It's supposed to come with a... There. That's the thing that fell out of the box on the shelf. Well, how do you play it? Don't you need dice or something? You don't play. The ouija board is a tool for communication. Communication with who? The dead. The dead? But they're dead. Dying isn't the end. It's the beginning. Aren't you supposed to ask it questions? Yes. Some poor souls or souls are supposed to inhabit each board. They're duty bound to answer any question put to it. Since when has Carol been into all this weird stuff? This is ridiculous. The dead have never left us. Their world exists all around us. They watch us. Through this board, the dead can reach out to us. And if you're a very good kitty, I will give Carol to you. You'd like that, wouldn't you, kitty? Yes, of course you would. Eenie meenie, chili beanie, the spirits are about to speak. Are they friendly spirits? Get out, get out. It's my turn. Get out! Okay, hardly put any pressure on it at all. It's moving! Go on, ask it something. This is stupid. How old am I? Ask it. How old is Adrienne Ruth? 24. That's right. You didn't know that, did you, Linda? This is so weird! Ask it how old I'm going to live to be. 24. I didn't do that really. It went by itself. This is not funny any longer. I got a good one for you. Ask it when the hell we're going home. N-e-v-e-r. I knew I shouldn't have asked. I'm not doing this on purpose. I'll ask it something about me then. Will Duke and I always be together? Oh man. No. Will we be together a month from now? No. Hey, don't look at me. You're the one asking it stupid questions. I'm not doing this. Why don't you give that thing a break? Aren't you gonna wear the batteries down or something? Maybe it is time to get out of here. Let's go. Will we ever leave this house alive? No. You moved it on purpose! All right, that's enough of this. Let's get out of here. Let's go. Carol, what's wrong? Carol, what's the matter? Leave. Leave. She is now mine and you must die and serve my will. She will take care of the others. Make sure she makes their departure somewhat amusing. The keys, where are the god damn keys?! I don't know where the keys are! What do I do?! Why do you have the nerve... Do something. Do something. Get me out of here. Let's get out of here now. What can I do?! I can't do anything! I told you! Don't panic! It stopped. The pounding has stopped. Are they gone? Did they go? Come on, let's roll. Don't be crazy, Duke! We're getting out of here. Hold it. You get the hell out of my way. Three seconds ago, you weren't so hot to get out there. But they're gone. I can't hear nothing. This is our chance. Well then, Duke, you just step right up and be my guest. Go ahead. I say we try and make a run for it. You are crazy. Look out there. Go on, take a good long look at that gravestone with Lewis's name on it. Go ahead and look. What are you afraid of? You through talking, mister? I'm gonna fix your ass! Oh god! Those things aren't gonna let us out of here. You still want to go out there? So what the hell are we going to do? Just stand here and wait for them to break in and murder us, huh? I don't think those things can get in here. You're right. If they could, they'd be in here by now. They don't want us to leave. They want to make sure we stay exactly where we are. Just like a simple game of chess. All the pieces are in place. Now, we may begin. We have waited a very long time for this, but this time, it will be forever. One by one, we're all going to die and replace some trapped soul in that board. What is going on here? What are we gonna do? The way I see it, we've only got two choices. Right. I don't want to be no sitting duck. Linda, come with us. Hey Linda, get your butt in gear. I'll be all right. He's taken good enough care of me up 'til now. Who's coming with me and Meegan? We're gonna check upstairs first. I'm with you, chief. Dave and I are staying right here. We're not creeping around some haunted house. It's much safer here. I don't know. My mind is made up. I am staying here. I guess we're staying here. Atta boy, Dave! That's putting her in her place! Shut up, you brainless twerp. All right, all right, I'm not gonna argue with anybody anymore. Let's go. Twerp? What the hell is a twerp anyway? Kreon? No. What have you done? I have waited by your side day and night for an entire lifetime. Stay away. I don't want you by my side. I don't want you anywhere near me. But you see now that we can never be separated. Please let me die. We live through each other. No. Release me. There can be no end for either of us. Why won't you let this end? I must when I will make you mine forever. Which way? I don't know. There's so many doors. They could lead anywhere. Something's got me! Something's got me! Get it off, get it off! It was an electrical cord, you idiot. Oh god, I thought I bought the farm that time! You scared the hell out of me. Are you all right? Aw yeah sure, I'm fine. I haven't met the electrical cord yet that can get the best of me. Okay, let's cut the humor, all right? This is funny? Okay, let's try this one. Door number one, monty. Jesus Christ! Take it easy! Take it easy? Don't tell me to take it easy. I know how to handle myself. You think I don't huh? All right, all right, forget it. Forget it? You think I can, huh? All right, all right, you do. Duke, somebody opened that door. I swear there's someone behind that door. Dukel Oh Duke, Duke? Baby? Oh god. Boo! You bastard, you god damn bastard! I'm gonna kill you! Oh, stop it. What are you, crazy? Oh god, what am I lying on? You can't get this. Now, hold on. Duke will provide. No, Duke. Let's just get out of here before something happens. Something's going to. Oh no, it's not. Ooh, look at me, I'm Duke the horny ghost. Hey, look at this. Vino. I told you Duke would provide. Don't drink that. That's probably vinegar or poison. Stop. It doesn't taste so good. Oh, it feels so good to lie down. You know, maybe there's some way out of here, maybe through some secret wall. Get out of here. Look, water! The wine, the wine barrel! Control, I'm in control. It's okay. You know, they've been gone an awfully long time. Well, maybe they're all dead. Oh, that's nice Adrienne. That's really nice. Well, it is a possibility, isn't it? Sure, sure, anything is! I don't like this room. I think we should go back by the front door. I like this room. I feel safe. You just don't want to do anything that I want to do. Isn't that right? Huh? Did you hear something? Peter, Meegan, I found the board! Rich? Richard? Rich? Did you find something? What did you find? You want my board? Well, the board wants you. No! Oh my god, she's got him! Please, no! Open! - Richard! - Richard! - Rich! - Rich, rich! Help Mel or for god's sakes, open the door! Rich! - Rich! - Rich! I can't see him anymore. I can't see anything. Well, let's see if there's another way into the room. Come on. I poisoned myself once before and I'll do it again or find another way. Haven't you learned that my will to have you is greater than your will to die? Even if you keep me prisoner for another 70 years, you'll never have Mel but I do have you. I control your past, your present, and your future. This time, there will be no escape. Finders keepers, losers weepers. David, throw that crap away. Why, because you say so? Because you don't drink, you asshole, and you'll only get sick. God knows who's touched it before you. I don't give a damn, honey! I don't. I really don't. I mean, we're all probably gonna die tonight anyways so why not get drunk? You're ridiculous. I don't think there is another way into that room. Oh god. So what do we do now? Maybe we should get Adrienne and Dave and break into the room. If the board is still in there... But then Carol's still in there. That's Carol. I think that's coming from over there. Come on. Here, Carol. Come and get me. Here, Carol, Carol, Carol. Ah, come on out and play fair, huh? Either kill me or get me the hell out of here. I gotta take a leak. Hey, what the hell am I worried about? This joint ain't the ritz. The whole place is a toilet. Meegan? Peter? Must be for midget ghosts or something. Duke, what are we doing here? Please, let's just get out of here. Let's go find the others. No! We're doing just fine by ourselves. Mister smart ass is gonna find out real soon I can get along just great without him. I don't know. I'd feel so much safer if we were all together. What, are you saying you don't trust me now? No, I'm not. You don't think I can take care of you. Isn't that it? Jesus Christ! Duke, I'm just scared! Oh please. It's all right. We'll get out of this soon. I promise we'll get out of here. David, David, wake up. Wake up, I hear something! That's good. Why don't you go back to sleep? Oh, damn you. Where are the others? You hear that? Where's it coming from? May god forgive me. This is the only way I know to save myself from them. I can't make out the signature. We're not the first. As before you were as you are not now, arise my servants. Arise they go in battle. Arise and be free. David, wake up! No matter what you do or where you run, I will win in the end. Peter? Meegan? Anybody? Help me, please. Why must you resist? There's no escape. Your future no longer belongs to you. It belongs to us. No, don't touch me! Can't you see I've always hated you? Is that any way to talk to the father of your children? Children? What do you mean children? We have only one child. No, my darling. We have many children. My god, what have you done? Tell me what have you done?! Would you like to see our son? Would you like to see our son? Would you? - Yes! Korda, my darling son. Your mother has returned to us. Come, give her a kiss. Mama. She won't go far. The farther she gets from me, the weaker she becomes. Peter, it's hopeless. We can't fight this thing. We can't. Look, this is not the time to give in. We've got to keep trying. There isn't a chance. Adrienne? David. Come to me, my darling. I need you. Just a little further. I can't, I can't go any further. David, take me out of here. I've been looking for you everywhere. David, I'm so afraid. We haven't heard anything for a while. I wonder if any of the others are still alive. I don't know. Oh my god, I'm so happy to see you guys. I told you we'd find them, Duke. Hasn't anybody seen Carol, or the others, or anything? Not Carol, but we almost got our tuchus plunged. In the basement, it was horrible. - What? - What happened? I don't know. These things came out of the ground. They tried to kill me. I don't know what they were. This is a nightmare. Didn't you see anything of the others, Adrienne and Dave or rich? I thought he went with you. We got separated. We don't know if he's dead or alive. Yeah, well I wouldn't give you 50/50 odds of him coming out on top, not after what we saw. What are you talking about? Dave is dead. I don't know about Adrienne, but she's probably finished too. None of us are gonna get out of here alive, none of us. We're gonna make it, okay? Why don't you shut the hell up? Why don't you take it easy? Nobody counts Duke out that easy, especially you, Meegan, especially you. Yeah, well this isn't so funny, dorko! Can't win against things. I told you to shut up. You don't know nothing, you stupid bitch! Oh, stop it! Get away. Hey! Leave them alone. They've been at it all night. Black liquid soul, arise with your dark minions. Arise and be free. Arise. Estrella, arise. Where the hell am I? This way. I can help you find your friends. What is this? I'm trapped here the same as you. But hurry, we must hurry. Wait a minute. Just what the hell is going on here? I told you there is no time. Do you want to die here? This is the way out to your friends and safety. There is nothing to be afraid of. Trust me, mister Adam. Hey, you know my name. How? Your friends. They spoke of you. Don't believe everything you hear, lady. You ready to go another round? I'm ready to finish you off! We've gotta stop 'em. Big guy. We're trapped! No way! Destroyer of bodies, taker of souls, arise and be free. Arise. Oh my god, no! Ah, shit! Duke! The door! Linda, come here. - Hey, Linda! - I can't! - Do you want me to... - I can't come out! Hurry up! Mister Adam? What? Now, the time has come. For what? This place has been my home, my prison for an eternity. What are you, nuts or something lady? What's going on, damn it? Where are my friends? Tell me! They're dead, mister Adam, as I am, as you are. Now, the time has come. She's losing a lot of blood. We gotta stop. Let's go in there. Come on. Ow, ow! Oh Christ, my leg feels like it's on fire! Just hold on. The door isn't gonna hold very long. We gotta get moving soon. She's very weak, Peter. I need a few more minutes. Please. Go out the window. Get out of the way. Open! Open! Oh no! Oh Christ, he's coming out after us! Come on, let's get back inside. What? What is it? I don't really know. It looks like Carol, the thing that took over Carol. Look here, this man in the picture. The ring on the hand is identical to the ring on that mummy downstairs. And the ouija board. Yeah, but without the demon figures. This guy was an occultist or a ghost hunter or something judging from all this stuff. Oh my god! Watch out, that's acid. That's not acid, not any kind we know. Soon, even those fools will realize it is I who controls the movement of all my players. That man, he may have found a way to fight these demons. Maybe it was some dark secret locked away in these papers that he managed to unearth. I don't know. Maybe he never knew. But I do know this. I want to live. I think the way to do that is to make our way downstairs and get ahold of that vial. We don't have much more to lose now. What about Carol? Let's at least try to even out the odds a little bit and after all we've seen, we won't have to go looking for Carol. She's gonna come looking for us. What fools. They flatter themselves. What makes them think their lives are worth saving? Well, perhaps I should let them live. No! Are you ready to kill? Yes, father! Any man with a weapon can commit murder, but it's such a waste. A sorcerer's son must learn to use death to control the force of life. This is the source of our power. Your time has come now. What happened to the lights? Join us. I said, join us. You think I will let you escape? I have enjoyed your resistance. You are very amusing. Why? I only want your souls. Your sacrifice will allow more worthy beings to live once again. No one should miss you. Now, you must prove to me that you can harness this power. You must concentrate. You must have a clear image of every detail. They no longer need Carol. They are your toys now. Do with them as you wish. My victims walk into the lair of the dead. They are all my children and I am their ultimate lord. I know now what I must do. Perhaps I've always known. It is only your resistance that's killing you. Love me and you'll be free. How can you speak of love? You're torturing me. Torturing you? It is you who are torturing me. I have devoted my life and the life of many others that you might live again. Love, how could I love you when I've never learned how to love? Let my love teach you. Tell me that you will love me, that you will love me for all time. I will love you for all time. Mama, mama. Ma. Let me go! Let me go! Lady, what are you doing to my car? Help me. Move over. Hurry! I can't believe it. I'm finally free. But you're not free. Don't you realize I've always loved you too?
