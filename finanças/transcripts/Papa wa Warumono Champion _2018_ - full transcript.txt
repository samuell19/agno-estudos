Now is his big chance. Will he do it? Will his finishing move, Fly-High, bring him victory? He's gone for the jump! That did it! It's over! Top face, Takashi Omura, finally wins the Z-1 Climax tournament! This is the man who will lead the future of Lion Pro-Wrestling! "10 years later" "Closed for the day" Shota. You're going to be late. When's Daddy coming? He should be back soon. Daddy? He just arrived at the airport. He can't come? He might not make it. Sorry, Shota. But Mommy will be there so don't worry. Okay, I understand. I'll be going then. See you later. "Hurry!" "My future dream My dream is to succeed my father's company. My father runs a consulting firm. Although he is very busy with work, he takes me to lots of places on his time off. He's bragging about his dad again. My dream is to be a bride. I like tall men that are strong and who have blonde hair. Maybe I'll dye my hair blonde. Me too. My mommy and daddy love each other and go on a date to many places whenever I have piano lessons. My mommy is good at chores and always keeps our house clean. My dream is to become bigger. My dad is very big but I am small, so I want to eat lots of my mom's food and become big like my dad. If I can grow to be big and strong, I think that will make me be nice to people. When I talked to my dad about this the other day, he gave me some magical medicine called protein. I always drink it with milk... Wait, Shota. Is that true? From when? Okay! Thank you very much, Shota. Um, who's next... Daiki. I don't really have any dream. Because people can live without dreams and dreams can be difficult. But when I told Mom it was for homework "From: Takashi Sorry, I got lost." she said no video games until I finish. So I just wrote about what I don't want to become. Your dad's interesting, Shota. You think so? What's your dad's job? What? I don't know. You don't know what he does? No... Does everyone know? Yeah, of course we do. Maybe he's doing some shady business. I bet he's in the Mafia. No way. My dad's not like that. You never know. Hey, can you all write these? What is it? Birthday cards. We want to celebrate Yuto's birthday next week. - Thanks in advance. - Thanks, guys. What's with them? Yuto's annoying. Just because his dad's great. That's what you call riding on his father's coattails. Anyways, ask your dad when you go home, Shota. Okay, I will. Shota, sorry I couldn't make it today. It's okay. You had work, right? What were you doing? Check out this pose. Isn't it cool? Yeah, it's cool. Hey, Daddy. You said to me before, that you would tell me your job when I get older. What do you do for work, Daddy? My work is... something I'll say when you're older. "My Dad is a Heel Wrestler" Do you know where Shota is? He's probably out playing. What're you doing? Do you know where the car keys are? What about your pocket? I can't find it. Did you leave it in the car? That's weird... Shota, where are you? Maybe he's doing some shady business. I bet he's in the Mafia. Today's you big day. Win or die. Don't chicken out. Get fired up. Alright, go for it. You know what you have to do. Put your game face on. Hey, kiddo. What are you doing here, huh? Goto propels Ishii to the ropes from a lockup. Goto's lariat. Ishii dodges. Coming back... Ishii's lariat connects! Coupled by a Brainbuster! Goto's back gives in. Ishii goes for the count. Is it over? Only 2 counts. Shota? Mana. You surprised me. Do you like pro-wrestling too? My daddy brings me to watch a lot. Hello. H-Hello. Dragon is giving autographs. Let's go together. Ah, well... And that's a fall! 3 counts! Shoot, it's already begun. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Who is that? Dragon George. You don't know him? N-No... He's tall and blonde and super strong. I like strong men with blonde hair. Wait. So then your dream is... Yep. I want to get married to someone like Dragon. Eh? We will be ending soon. Mr. Dragon needs to get ready for his match. Finally, we're giving out limited Dragon candies. Gather around for it. Let's go. You too, Shota. Is it really OK for me to sit here? Sure. We happened to have an extra ticket. How mature of you to come here on your own. Shota, you're so grown-up. Ah, it's starting. The audience who filled the stands must have all been waiting for this man's entrance. The entire arena is calling out to the dragon. Two-time winner of Z-1 Climax. Undoubtedly, the impeccable and ultimate champion. Dragon George appears in front of us! Go for it, Dragon! From the start of the year, no one could stop him. He comes to this ring with a perfect record. The living legend of Lion Pro-Wrestling has now entered the fighting square. Who's Dragon's opponent? That's weird... Look. Something's under the ring. It's an ambush by Cockroach Mask from underneath the ring! What a way to begin the fight! What is that guy? He's Cockroach Mask. Everyone hates him. But don't worry. Cockroach Mask is weak. Cockroach Mask tries to push him into the ropes but is countered with a dropkick! See? Lucifer Saito was supposed to fight today. Cockroach Mask is just a stand-in. To be honest, they're in a different league. It's becoming Dragon's game. Oh! But here comes Blue Bottle Mask. It's not one against one? Blue Bottle Mask is his partner. Cockroach Mask fights unfair like that. Oh no! It's the Roach Spray! Dragon George gets blinded. Followed by the Roach-trap Slingblade! Completely illegal. Such dirty tactics. While Blue Bottle Mask distracts the referee, Cockroach Mask makes another illegal attack. Dragon! Hang in there! Dragon! He's so low. I hate Cockroach Mask. Me too. I hate that kind of guy. Stand up, Dragon. Dragon George is getting stomped on. Cockroach Mask and Blue Bottle Mask double teaming in a one-on-one match. Cockroach Mask slides back into the blue ring. Shota, cheer for Dragon. That's unfair, Cockroach Mask! Fight fair and square! Daddy. Shota. Big Boots! Right in the face! Dragon didn't let Cockroach get away with his guard down. And a dropkick! Yes! Dragon's back on the attack. Shota, isn't that great? Dragon! Dragon, go for it! Go, Dragon! That's right, Dragon! Dragon's so cool. A cockroach is no match for a dragon. Cockroach Mask loses the match. Way to go, Dragon! Shota? Daddy is... Daddy is... a bad guy? What happened, Cockroach? You acted strange. Sorry. I need to go out a sec. Where're you going? Shota! Shota. Why are you here? What about you? Why? Why is it you hide your face and do bad things? I hate my dad who's a bad guy. We should have told him earlier. How could I ever tell him that I'm Cockroach Mask? Then what's your plan? When Shota was born, you said you'll only be a heel for a few years. It's been 10 years now. - It's still 9 years. - Same thing. You can't go back anymore. Just tell him honestly your job is a heel wrestler. If you can't tell him, I will. I'll tell him myself. "Protein" - Good morning, Shota. - Morning. Shota, about yesterday... I'm going now. What about breakfast? I don't need it. Hey, wait! What's your dad's job? Stop! - Mafia's kid! - He's not a Mafia. Wait! Are you okay? What the hell. Hey, you guys. Where's your birthday cards? - Tell us! - Your dad's job! A pro-wrestler. - A pro-wrestler? - Seriously? Sorry to grab you. What's going on? Shota's dad is a pro-wrestler. Wow, that's amazing. Who? What's his name? Oh my god, is he Dragon George? Dragon George? That Dragon George? We saw his match yesterday. Shota was so moved he was crying. Are you for real? A shrimp like you is really Dragon's son? Shota, please. I really love Dragon. Can you get his autograph for me? Uh... I want one too. Me too. Me too. Um! I'll try asking. Thank you! Hooray! Slow down, Cockroach. Let's take a break, man. You rest all the time. Of course, I'm not young anymore. We do 200 matches annually. Hey, Blue Bottle. How many years have you been a heel? Unlike you, I started off as a heel. Maybe 20 years. Don't you ever get sick of it? Never. When I hear the audience booing, it makes me thrilled. I think, "Give me more! Jeer for me even more!" What? You don't like it? Don't ask for too much, Cockroach. With that knee of yours, be thankful to even wrestle. Yeah, I understand. Takashi Omura's era is over. You can't go back to being a face anymore. Michiko. Michiko. What's wrong? You were moaning. What? Was I speaking out? Yes, rather loud. Oh, sorry. You know, Z-1 Climax is opening next month. What's Z-1 Climax? You don't know? Oh yeah, you grew up overseas. No, I didn't. And you don't know? It's a national event. Do you know it? No. Whoa whoa whoa. Excuse me. Are you people alright? Z-1 Climax is the tournament to decide the strongest pro-wrestler. Oh, I see. "Oh, I see"? We're not hardcore pro-wrestling fans like you. It's common knowledge for any Japanese. Anyways, what were you moaning about? You see, I was predicting all the possible contestants. Then I went over the maximum number of words. What should I do? Hey, Cockroach. You got a minute? So actually, Saito, who was supposed to enter Z-1 Climax, got booked for a Mexico tour. Which means I've been thinking who can take his place. Co... Co? What do you think of Tatsuya Condo? Condo? That's right. I'm a little worried since he's still a rookie. I think he's good. You think so? That's great. If you says so, I'm reassured. Thanks, Cockroach. Hey, Condo. Condo! Hey, Condo. Can you get his autograph for me? Sorry I just came. You're late. - Check this out. - What? Dragon's signature! Yep. I found a good deal online. Hold on, isn't this a fake? No way. Sit still. Lt says Dra-Con George. Don't lie. That's what a real one looks like. Huh? What the... Hey. What are you doing? Hey, stop. Whoa, be careful... Don't run. Tranquillo (calm down). You surprised me. What happened? Where's Shota? He's not back yet. I'm fighting. Ln Z-1 Climax. You? Cockroach Mask? Yeah. Wait! Hold it right there. Stop! You little rascal. Real wresting fans don't steal autographs. I'm not a fan. Shota. I'm very sorry. What are you doing? Did you do something bad? Cockroach Mask does bad things too. Hey, wait. Shota. Ah, excuse me... Why didn't you bring him back? What could I do? He ran away. Oh, he's back. - I'm home. - Hello, dear. Daddy has something to tell you. Shota, guess what... Daddy. I want an autograph. An autograph? - Mine? - Why all of a sudden? I haven't told him yet. I want Daddy's autograph. Shota, have you become my fan? No. But I want your autograph. What a strange child. Alright. I'll give you as many as you want. I only need one. Good morning. Um, were you able to get it? "Cockroach Mask" "Dragon George" Thank you. "I'm going to win Z-1!" Cockroach Mask is going to be in Z-1? Yeah, I guess so. Is that right. Cockroach has finally made Z-1! Here you go, Mana. Thank you! It's real. That's awesome. Shota, you really are Dragon's son. He wasn't the Mafia... Shota, let's go watch a match together again. - I want to go too. - Me too. - Me too. - Why all of you? Should we go too? No way. Who would go watch pro-wrestling? Chief, I beg you. Let me do a wrestling feature. Move. THE Cockroach Mask is going to be in Z-1. This is a huge scoop. Who? What? You don't know him? Cockroach Mask. The former star, Takashi Omura is coming back to Z-1. Ya know him? - Nope. - Hey. No can do. Chief. Mr. Ueda has become ill. We need to fill a page. Mr. Ueda?! Machida... Pro-wrestling is gaining interest now. Why don't we Jet her do it? You wanna try? Yes, sir! Then do it. Thank you, sir! The fight is about to begin. The tournament to decide the strongest wrestler... Z-1 Climax. The young babyface, Dragon George. "Young Babyface" The fantastic speed star, Joel Hardy. "Speed Star" The destroyer, Sweet Gorilla Maruyama. "The Destroyer" A star-studded cast... But among them all, we want to draw attention to Cockroach Mask. "The Most Hated Wrestler" The veteran is betting himself on this tournament. Will the cockroach in the shadow be able to fly out into the spotlight? The opening match takes place June 25th. We cannot wait for the bell. I'm done. "Lion Pro-Wrestling" Go on in. Wow, so many people. Hey, it's Cockroach Mask. I want to do that too. Take this. Shota, come and do it. Dragon, Dragon... Go give it your dynamite punch. Shota, that's cool. You're amazing. Today marks the opening of Z-1 Climax. Among the 16 warriors chosen to compete, who will survive the deadly tournament and emerge as winner? Joel Hardy versus Cockroach Mask. Moments to the bell. Cockroach Mask is serious today. Look. It's the 4-dimensional trash barrel. The 4-dimensional trash barrel? Lt sounds horrible. All sorts of weapons come out from there. The bell signals the start to the first round of Z-1 Climax. Unbelievable. He's offering a handshake. Hey, he's not a bad guy. Kneeling down, he puts his hand out again. Can we trust the cockroach? Ohh! As expected. It's a low blow to the groin. He's dirty after all. Let's not grow up to be like that. Slingshotting off the ropes with a left lariat. Hardy ducks and kicks the abdomen. Using the ropes, and connecting with the knee. He's working Cockroach Mask's left knee. Grabbing the leg, Hardy continues kicking the back of the knee. He's aiming for the knee. It's Cockroach's weak point. Taking the leg and locking into a figure-four leglock. Cockroach Mask screaming in agony. The pain shooting through his face. His injured knee giving in. That's unfair, Hardy! Why Shota? Cockroach Mask is more unfair. Oh, you're right. Go for it, Hardy! G-Go for it, Hardy. Go Hardy! Breaking loose from the leglock at last. A seated dropkick into the chest. The referee begins counting... He kicks out. Cockroach Mask escapes outside of the ring. But Hardy takes on both of the masked wrestlers! Please be careful of fights outside the ring. And then... Oww! But Blue Bottle Mask interferes! Go, Hardy! They created a two-against-one situation. Lt could be said Hardy was lured out of the ring. Is that allowed? Tying up both arms... Who would've imagined? This must have been Cockroach Mask's plan. Cockroach Mask, you suck. Joel Hardy manages to untie himself, coming back into the ring at 19 counts. Right punch, backhand chop... Go, Hardy! Both men backing into their corners. Locked-on. Here he comes. Struck with the right elbow. And utilizing the top rope... A swinging DDT! Brain damage right there. Hardy with his chance. Ohh, but Cockroach Mask returns a hold! A last-minute comeback with a single move! Cockroach Mask steals the win! Hardy appeals in vain. He's eliminated in the first round. Lt sucks to see such a scumbag win. But I'm sure Dragon will beat him, right? Yeah. Cockroach Mask advances to the next round. Sweet Gorilla Maruyama as well as Dragon George smooth-sailed past the first round. The Z-1 Climax has been narrowed down to 8 survivors. Who will be victorious? Dragon's match was amazing. No one can beat your dad, Shota. Shota, I want his autograph too. With my name on it. Me too. Okay. Shota. You came to watch. Your father's match was great. I know. Shota's dad is the best. He's so cool. So all of you are his fan too. Don't you think Cockroach... Sorry, I'm going to go see my dad. You can all go ahead. Who the hell? Don't know. What's going on, Shota? Hey, Michiko! A kid is scolding me... Don't talk to me in the venue. I'm keeping it a secret that my dad is Cockroach Mask. What? Why? You should brag about it. How can I? He's a bad guy. Bad guys are also necessary in pro-wrestling. A wrestler's job is to entertain people. If everyone was a hero, it would be no fun. I don't really know. Say, Daddy... Maybe you should quit wrestling. What do you mean? Daddy won. Even if you win, Cockroach Mask just gets hated. If you can't be like Dragon, I’d rather have a normal dad. Shota. Wrestling is Daddy's passion. Even if I'm not cool, I want to continue pro-wresting. Daddy, what are you doing? You've gotten heavier. I'm going to become champion for you, no matter what. "Cockroach Mask, Unstoppable!" Michiko. Hello, Chief. Cockroach Mask is awesome. He won again, right? Yes. Michiko's story is buzzing online as well. Only our magazine had an eye on him. Alright. If Cockroach Mask makes it to the finals, we’ll make him the cover story! Are you serious? Thank you. "Otomo Clinic" Does it hurt? A little. Your face doesn't say so. How is it? What do you expect? Your knee is injured, as well as your neck. Do something. I'm not sure what I can. You've already been wrecked once. There'll be a Z-1 next year. Think about the future. There is no future. I'm already past my prime. This year is my last chance for Z-1. Alright, quiet class. Today I want you to draw a picture of your dream that you wrote about for parents' day. Teacher, I don't have a dream. Then think of one. Those who don't finish will have to finish it for homework. That sucks. It's definitely weird. Shota can't be Dragon George's son. But the autograph... You don't have to be his son to get an autograph. Ringo. What's up, Yuto? I have a favor to ask. What is it? I'll do anything. Now let it sit for a while. Welcome. Oh my, you're by yourself? Okay, have a seat. What kind of haircut? Please make it cute. Gotcha. I'm Shota's friend. Oh, you are? Shota is so amazing. Really? I can't believe his father is Dragon George. That's weird. Shota was saying so. Is that not true? I'm back. Ringo. Thank you very much. Why is she here? What's going on? Your father isn't Dragon George, right? I know. Then why? But you were lying too. You didn't tell me what Daddy's job is. Shota. Come back here. Shota. Shota, I apologize for not telling you about Daddy's work. I'm sorry. Forgive me. But I want you to understand that Daddy works very hard for us. He can do some other job. Wrestling is Daddy's calling. I guess you can also say that's all he can do. Anyways, following your passion even as an adult is an amazing thing. Being Cockroach Mask is Daddy's passion? - I'm home. - Hi. What's wrong? Shota, can I come in? What? Do you want to go to the bathhouse? Not today. Shota. I heard from Mommy. That you're lying in school. I have no choice. There's no way I can say you're Cockroach Mask. Shota. Today, Daddy won again. Two more and I'm the champion. You don't need to become the champion. Just stop being the bad guy. Your job embarrasses me. "Injury sends top face Omura off the ring" "I want to have a normal job. My dream is to become a businessman." Shota, what's with that? Isn't your dream to be a pro-wrestler? No... I don't want to. What's up with him? C'mon, he's just joking. I don't think so. Hey, Shota. Is your dad really Dragon? Ringo asked yesterday. When I asked your mom, she was surprised and froze up. She's just keeping it a secret. Shota didn't know until recently either. But my dad was saying Dragon doesn't have a kid. Duh! It's a secret. Why's it a secret? We already know. Who would tell someone like you, you tard! Shota. Shota, what's the matter? You look down these days. Sorry. You don't need to worry about what Yuto was saying. Let's go watch Dragon's match again. Sorry. I'm not going to go watch wrestling anymore. Why? Your dad would be sad if you don't watch him. Let's go root for your dad who's fighting hard. What happened? I want you to check my knee. What? Does it hurt? No, it's not that it hurts. I want to jump the Fly-High in the next match. What do you mean? I'm making a comeback... as a face. I'll put it in the usual spot. Good to go. I'm excited for the next match. I wonder when they're starting. I can't wait. The ultimate heel match has started. On the ring is top contender Sweet Gorilla Maruyama, aka The Destroyer, and Cockroach Mask, who has been unstoppable this tournament. Maruyama shoves his opponent into the ropes. Cockroach Mask with his back against the ropes. Go for it. Sweet Gorilla Maruyama makes the first attack. Here it comes. The Roach Spray. Pulling out from behind his back... Isn't the Roach Spray! What? Where's the Roach Spray? Sweet Gorilla Maruyama kicks his opponent in the crotch. Running him into the red corner... A punch with a closed fist. Cockroach Mask is no good at all today. Shut the hell up! This is bad. It's getting out of hand. What're you doing? Cockroach Mask not using any hostile heel tactics today. What in the world has happened to him? Ohh! But Blue Bottle Mask makes a run-in. He couldn't stand watching. C'mon, do him in, Cockroach! His partner urges him on. Cockroach Mask gets the perfect set-up in the usual manner. Why doesn't he attack? I have no idea. What's he doing? Finish him. Cockroach! Cockroach! Why isn't he attacking? Even with Blue Bottle Mask's aid and his biggest chance in front of him, he remains still. Cockroach! Cockroach! He took off his mask! And underneath the mask is the former super star Takashi Omura! What the hell is he doing! The whole audience is screaming out in joy. The house is in an uproar. Listen to this. Omura! Omura! The crowd is chanting his name. Takashi Omura is cheered on with his reappearance after 10 years. Daddy... Shota! Here he comes! Wait, Shota. Scooping him up... A punishing Powerslam! He's climbing onto the top rope. Is it Takashi Omura's signature technique? Is it going to be the Fly-High?! Shota. Your dad is Cockroach Mask? You were lying? I'm sorry. Why? I hate you! The Spider German Suplex! He's going for it. He's airborne! A SG knee drop! It's over! The finalist is Sweet Gorilla Maruyama! Takashi Omura doesn't make his comeback. The Destroyer finally gets to the top. What the hell, Cockroach? I didn't hear about this. I thought we were partners. What about our tag? Say something. A masked wrestler can never go back if he takes off his mask. Blue Bottle. Stop. He's fired. But... What do you expect. Let's go. Hey, Cockroach. What happened? Pull yourself together, Cockroach. - Mommy. - Shota. Daddy was taken to the hospital. Daddy... Daddy, are you alright? He can get up. I'm sorry, Shota. I couldn't be like Dragon. Daddy, I'm sorry. It's my fault. It's not your fault. Lt was my own decision. - But... - Shota. Daddy's tired. Why don't we go outside. Alright? Come on. Don't worry. Daddy's strong. He’ll get better. Mommy. I'm sorry. The other day, I told Daddy that I hate him. Today, a girl I like told me the same thing. Lt was really painful. Was Daddy feeling the same way? Come here. "Editorial Department" Why? You're canceling his cover story? Of course. Cockroach Mask lost. But he unmasked himself. There's controversy between fans. We need to write about it. We're not a wrestling magazine. Once you lose, the public has no interest. He's just a cockroach. Wrestling is not about winning or losing. It's a way of life! OK. I get you. Really? Thank you very much. Take that feeling of yours and you can write a diary to show your daddy. Why? Why you! Michiko. Michiko! You too. Gosh, she's strong. Is Shota here? He hasn't come. It's already been 3 days. How would he be able to... - There's no way Shota can be Dragon's son. - "Cockroach kid" Yeah, he's lying. He's been labeled cockroach kid but they still believe him. Shota. You're not going again? You should go. The winner is Dragon George! A Rising Dragon in combo with the Dragon Maker. He takes home the gold with a clean finish. The Z-1 Climax... Defending the title with an unprecedented third consecutive crown! Hang in there. Daddy. When's your next match? I told you. Daddy quit wrestling. Why? I can't fight anymore. I'm going to be a normal dad. Aren't you happy? - Congratulations on your win. - Thank you. Lt seems like you have no competition left. Who do you want to fight? Well, currently... Nobody in particular. Only... I have a former wrestler in mind. Who may that be? Takashi Omura. You okay? Yes, thank you. Please raise the volume. The volume? Sure. I've always admired him. He made a comeback the other day. Would you want to fight him? I'm not sure. If he can perform like he did in those days, yes. But I don't want to see him weak. Ask him to see what he says. "Dragon names Omura" Yes, hello? You know what I'm calling for. You've been appointed by Dragon. I could let you fight again if you want. Shota. Michiko. It's been a while. Good for your father. I'll go watch his match with Dragon no matter what. That's all I'm looking forward to now. Sorry. Daddy's not going to fight. Why not? Hey, wait. Shota. Dragon appointed my old dad. My current dad can't fight Dragon. Is that what your father said? Yeah. I can't believe that. He would never give up. Well... Oh yeah. I have this. Please hand it to your father. I wrote a feature on Cockroach Mask. Although the plan fell through partway. Why do you root for my dad so much, Michiko? Are you sure about this? I realized I can't go back to my old self. If I keep fighting, it's just going to make Shota sad again. Don't make it your son's fault. Shota doesn't know the old Takashi Omura. The one Shota wants to root for is his current dad. "Cockroach Mask Special Feature" This... is my dad? That's right. Cockroach Mask 10 years ago. Back then he was fighting under his real name. Takashi Omura was so strong. He was a star. Kind of like Dragon George right now. My dad was like Dragon? Most definitely. When I was in high school, my boyfriend took me to watch wrestling for my first time. Your father was the main event that day. Michiko, you had a boyfriend? What? Of course I did! How rude. That's not the point of the story. Sorry. I mean, it's okay. True, I haven't had one since for 10 years. C'mon, let's eat. - Go ahead. - Thanks. Omura who has been on the ropes regains his rhythm. Here comes the strong right arm. Dodging the attack and this time coming back with the left arm. His opponent takes some damage as well. Standing back up, they face each other again. The battle continues. This match... My dad really was strong... Of course. But he got injured after this. At the time, he stated, "I'm not going to end like this." "I promise to return to the front lines. You all wait for me." Those were his words. Ln the end, he never came back and turned into Cockroach Mask. My dad's a liar after all. He's not a liar. I still believe him. Even after 10 years... Even though he's become Cockroach Mask... Takashi Omura will keep his promise. However many times he falls down... A wrestler always stands back up. Fans are always given courage by seeing that spirit. That's why... Shota? Shota... I'm off. Shota? Shota. Takashi, come over here. "Aim for champion" "Cockroach Mask Special Feature" Shota... Hey, cockroach. Why're you here? Go home, you're dirty. Yuto, that's enough. Shota's the son of a bad guy. Of course he lies. You're right. It's true. I'm a liar. But my dad's not a bad guy. What are you saying? Your dad's Cockroach Mask. Yeah, he's a bad guy. He's a bad guy... But he's not a bad person. My dad's nice. My dad's strong. He's different from me! You guys listen to me. My dad's going to beat Dragon George in the next match. And he's going to become the new champion. He will FOR SURE. All of you, watch carefully. Shut up. Get down. Big mouth. "Totally unexpected Advances to semis" "Cockroach Mask Special Feature" I'll have the venue sold out. I'm counting on you. I apologize for the other day. You gonna fight? Yeah. Good for you. It's the return of Takashi Omura. Blue Bottle. I need your help. Mommy, I'm leaving. Go cheer for Daddy. Aren't you coming? I have work. And also, I get worried watching Daddy fight. I entrust you. OK. I'll cheer in place of you. Thanks. What're you doing? Come on. Ah... yeah. Hey, Shota. Don't you have something to say? I'm sorry. That's it? Sorry. Forget it. We're going to be late. Let's run. Do these as well. By the end of the day. What? Chief, wait. I have somewhere to go from now... Hey, what are you doing? I wanted to do this article. Yuri... Leave the rest up to us. You should go. Um... Can you change the channel? I'm sorry. Not today. You won't regret it. It's the right channel. Regret? Oh... I see. Hi, everyone. Hello. I just came to cheer for Dragon. Hey. Change seats with Shota. - Why? - Just do so. Mana. What? Sorry that I lied the whole time. You should've just said he's Cockroach Mask in the beginning. That's amazing enough. I would brag if I were you. You're right. Lt just makes the pain go away. You're still injured. Don't forget that. Yeah, I know. You can only jump the Fly-High once. Go nail it and become the champ.

For the first time in 10 years, we hear Takashi Omura's entrance theme song. The man who once shined as a star walks into the arena packed with fans. He makes his long-awaited appearance. What? He's wearing a mask! And as I speak, his entrance music changed to Cockroach Mask's theme song. Omura! Omura!

Grabbing Dragon George's hair, swinging him around... A return dropkick. But he saw it coming. Dragon's face crunching in agony. Catching Cockroach Mask on the way back. Dragon Maker! Misses! Wow. Today's Cockroach Mask is on fire. He's on par with Dragon. Not quite. Dragon still hasn't shown what he's got. Slicing the elbow up. Wow, amazing. Dragon George goes after Cockroach Mask. What's going to happen? Here he comes. At no surprise. Blue Bottle Mask buzzing out as the crowd jeers. Holding Dragon George in place. There it is! Coming out of nowhere. Roach Spray! Dragon's handsome face getting all ruined. The champion is looking grim. This is bad. That Roach Spray is deadly. It's the metal bin used to store all sorts of weapons inside. Casing him with the 4-Dimensional Trash Barrel... Sandwiched! Dragon George totally victimized. But this time he throws Cockroach Mask into the fence. Carried over the fence with a high kick.

But Cockroach Mask makes the first attack. It's an elbow war. Both wrestlers shouting out. Dragon George follows through. He put in all his might. Oh! Cockroach Mask kicking the knees out. He went straight for the knees. Go! Turning over Dragon George's bulky body and putting him in a Texas Cloverleaf. - Go, go, go! - Ouch, ouch, ouch. Will Dragon George accomplish a rope break?

Dragon got his knee. He's holding his knee. Cockroach Mask's left knee is his Achilles' Heel. Holy! Blue Bottle Mask for the rescue. He's done it again! An all-new Roach Spray! Thanks to some assistance, a German Suplex. But he can't follow up. Daddy... The pain in his knee is keeping him from going into a cover. Lt looks grueling to even stand.

Your were strong. Just like Takashi Omura in his prime. I'll fight you again! Shota. What if Daddy uses some dirty trick? I'll still cheer for him. That's not right. When Daddy does something unfair, stand up and shout, "That's unfair, Cockroach!" But I feel sorry for him. You shouldn't feel sorry. Jeering is the best way to cheer for heel wrestlers. That's how they get the audience excited. That's unfair, Cockroach Mask! Get out already! Shota, why do you say that? Because... That's because this is my dad's job.
