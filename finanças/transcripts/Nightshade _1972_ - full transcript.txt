Yes, a Mercedes. You wanted to see the house. Here is the bathroom. - Ah, the light. - It does not matter. You rarely take guests. I am sure that you rarely get visitors. Are there more rooms? There are rooms at the upper floor. Oh, you're up there. I was looking for you. You want it to sell quickly. You do not have to decide today. Yes... There should be more rooms at the bottom. - This is my room. - Very cute. - Oh, what is behind that door? - There's the same thing. - Can you show me? - It's true - all the same. And besides, it is not cleaned up. It does not matter. But if you want ... Good. It is still 8 pm? That can not be. The clock stopped. I'm always here for 8 pm. The watch shows it for a long time. My watch shows 23:16. Already really night time. For me, it's late. You are not afraid at night? - Because you live alone. - Yes, with the horses.

The last time I was a child. - But you ... - Probably, it is necessary sometimes. - We can go for groceries. - No. You are welcome! I want to leave. It seems it's time. You like the breakfast? You tried so hard to cook it. But I just do not like eggs. - Why? - I rarely eat breakfast. And if you eat breakfast, at work. I spilled jam. This often happens to me. I have a shirt. I'll wash. No, it does not matter. - I'm leaving soon. - We would like to talk about the price. For the home. We can go for groceries and talk about the price. Anywhere. Where you want. No! I beg you, do not.

I asked him to stay for the weekend. To stay forever. I wanted... Werner got angry. He said: "I'd better leave now." If he ... If it was time, he would come. The years that we spent together ... These years ... were a living hell for him. He would never have changed his mind. I still believe ... what he... He came to me. He wanted to leave. Suddenly he was gone. He wanted to return to the city. And chose the shortest route. The path near the lake. Near the lake, where the swamp is. He... He did not see it and did not know about it. I could have yelled, but I did not. When he noticed it it was too late. I saw... He could not get out. He was sinking deeper. I saw... I watched as he plunged deeper and deeper. I... I knew this. I let him go down. He could not get out. I loved him. Now and forever. Forever and ever. That is what I wanted to tell you. So that... I give you a house. Just open your letter. Simple ... But... Adieu! Helen! Helen!
