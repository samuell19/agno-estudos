♪ [theme song "South of the Border"] [buzzing sound] [truck horn] Walter Pool: Oh, man! Oh, no! Speaker 2: [Spanish] Oye, burrito. No saludas. A donde vas, burrochito. [street sounds] Walter Pool: Cervesas. Manuel: Si, every day, mas cervesas. Walter Pool: Yeah, what do you want? Too cold. Too cold. Yeah. Cervesas. Manuel: [Spanish] Senor, Guerra. Jose Guerra: [Spanish] Jose. Solomente Jose. No mas, no menos. Manuel: [Spanish] Muchas gracias por el honor de su presencia en estas últimas semanas. Espero que mi cantina pueda aliviar el dolor de tu tragedia. No sé cómo eres capaz de soportar tanto. Fue una tragedia terrible. Jose Guerra: [Spanish] Lo sé. Pero es una tragedia lo que nos enoble. Y yo tengo continuar a vivir. Bueno, pues, sentimonos. Manuel: Senor, come on, come on. Hey, time to go home. Two o'clock in the morning. Time to go away. [Spanish] Ah, Dios mio. Walter Pool: I am so hungry. Can I- Manuel: Maritza, un platillo, rapido, rapido. Walter Pool: I'll work for it. Just scraps. I'll work for the cervesas too. Manuel: These gringos are the laziest people on the earth. Walter Pool: Miss Lucy Goldwasser, 355 Huron Drive, Paramus, New Jersey. Dear Lucy, I hope you're doing better, starting to move on and leaving memories of me behind. I know you'd hate to see what I've become but it would make me feel better if you got some kind of pleasure out of it. You see, my second week here stumbling around drunk, a walking cliché in a white guayabera shirt and Panama hat, I got the shit kicked out of me and robbed. Stupid me, I was carrying almost every dime I had. Hell, I wasn't going to be no tourist and carry American Express. I'm not writing my novel yet. I know, I know, how can a guy who read nothing but Cliff Notes in school fancy himself a writer, but, it's what I want to do, and Cliff Notes can be very inspiring in their way. Still, you must find me pathetic. Well, maybe not, because, you'll never know what I've become. You'll never get this letter because, just like the novel, there is no letter. It wasn't really you I was leaving, Lucy. It's beautiful here at night. Except for the stars I can't see a damn thing. [buzzing] Male: [Spanish] Louis Graves: Always can tell when someone's watching, huh? Walter Pool: Who are you? Louis Graves: Louis Graves. Great to meet you. Walter Pool: Yeah, but, what do you want? Louis Graves: Well, this isn't exactly a tourist town. Walter Pool: That's why I came. Louis Graves: You're the first American I've seen in weeks. You know, I like to exercise my English, plus despite the fact you could use a Clorox bath, you seem like a pretty swell guy. Walter Pool: Ah, look, don't get offended, but I'm not that chatty nowadays. Louis Graves: Let me the chatty one. Think of me as the evening's entertainment, like you've gone to your local playhouse to see Pippin. Hey, believe it or not, I understand. I used to be right smack where you are now, two years straight. All I needed was a break. I got it, now look at me. Walter Pool: A regular people person. Louis Graves: Yes, exactly. A people person. Thank you. Understand I'm chatty because I listen. A man who does not listen is man with nothing to say. You like that? It's an epigram. I wrote it. I mean that's what I do. I'm an epigram writer. Walter Pool: For a living? Louis Graves: Yeah, well, I wish. You know, I send them into Reader's Digest every now and then but they won't publish me because I don't have the juice behind me, you know? I mean you gotta be a name like Ben Franklin or Euripides. Walter Pool: Louis? Louis Graves: Yeah? Walter Pool: Go away. You don't want to talk to me. I'm what these Mexicans call a pendejo. Louis Graves: No. Walter Pool: Yes. Louis Graves: No. Walter Pool: Yes. Louis Graves: No man is a pendejo if he has but even one he can call amigo. Are you hungry, amigo? Walter Pool: I'm always hungry. Louis Graves: Manuel? [Spanish] and I don't even know his name... Walter Pool: Walter Pool. Louis Graves: [Spanish] Senor Walter Pool. Manuel: [Spanish] Senor. Louis Graves: I mean, I don't do drugs. Only a handful of people that I know down here do drugs, but everybody in the States does drugs. Do you know Walter, that Americans spent four billion dollars last year to keep drugs out of their fucking precious fortress? Walter Pool: Lot of money. Louis Graves: Yeah. I mean you reduce the demand and you don't have to worry about the supply. Walter Pool: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Louis Graves: But Americans aren't very inward looking, Walter. I mean, not when they can just point the finger at the poor brown folk down south, you know, who are just trying to feed themselves any way they can. Listen to me, I mean, I say I am a listener and not just a talker, but all I've been doing is talking. Walter Pool: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Louis Graves: So Walter. Walter Pool: Hmm? Louis Graves: Tell me, what brings you to Santiago? Walter Pool: I'm hiding. Louis Graves: Really? Walter Pool: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Louis Graves: Why? Walter Pool: I killed a man. Louis Graves: Really? Walter Pool: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Louis Graves: And, uh, how did that feel? Walter Pool: Good. Good. I killed a man. "So, how did that feel?" Felt good, yeah, felt good. What an idiot. Louis Graves: She's perfect. A woman where you need a woman, and a girl where you need a girl. The kind who will take of you even while she's letting think you're taking care of her. Walter Pool: Are you following me? Louis Graves: Yeah. It's not the first time either. I know you've stood here many nights. Walter Pool: You know one day I'm going to go up to her and well, say something. Louis Graves: What will it be? Walter Pool: I don't know. Whatever it is it's going to be perfect. Louis Graves: Don't you worry that she might see you in the street looking the way you do? First impression goes astray, she may not look another day. Walter Pool: No. When I approach her she won't even know it's the same guy. She's not going to see this bum but the real me, and she's going to love me for just that. Louis Graves: What if she doesn't? Walter Pool: I'll blind her with my wealth. I don't like being followed. Why do you do it? Louis Graves: I'll tell you, but before I do please understand that what I have to say does not mean I was playing games before. I do think of you as my amigo. Walter Pool: Thanks. Christ, I was worried. Louis Graves: You say you killed a man. Walter Pool: Uh-huh. Louis Graves: You say it felt good. Walter Pool: Uh-huh. Louis Graves: Then perhaps you might kill another. Even before I spoke to you I knew you were a man with a killer inside him. Walter Pool: Really? Louis Graves: Yeah. It's in the eyes. Walter Pool: Really? Louis Graves: Let's get down to business, Walter. I'm talking about a job, the kind that pays 1,000 clean and crisp 100 dollar bills. This is your break, Walter, the chance to be the man you always wanted to be. The man she wants you to be. So please, amigo, follow me. Please forgive the Uzi's Walter. They are the vilest of guns, but when you're dealing with this kind of money in a very poor country... Walter Pool: Sure, I understand. Louis Graves: You may ask questions, of course. Walter Pool: Who you want me to kill? Louis Graves: A bad man. Walter Pool: How bad? Louis Graves: Very, bad. Walter Pool: Good, because I only kill men if they're bad. I mean very bad. Louis Graves: Three months ago he raped and murdered a 16 year old boy. Walter Pool: The son of Jose Guerra. Louis Graves: A very brilliant, fun, energetic, popular, and kind, most importantly kind, boy. But naïve, lured in my a monster. Walter Pool: Hmm. Who? Louis Graves: Herberto Ortega, the only man in town richer than Senor Guerra. Walter Pool: Are you sure this man is guilty? Louis Graves: The night of the murder several witnesses saw him with the boy at the crime scene only minutes before the body was found. Ortega did not know he had been observed. Everyone knows he's committed several similar crimes in other cities, other poor countries, but he's officially clear. I mean, his money and the right friends make him very popular with the courts and police but detested by all others. Walter Pool: Okay. Why me? Louis Graves: You're an outsider. You know what it is to kill. Walter Pool: Mm. In other words they won't connect me to Guerra. I don't know. Louis Graves: What is it, amigo? Walter Pool: Shit. Is Guerra the guy who always wears those Armani suits? Louis Graves: He is building a new cathedral for this town. Walter Pool: Uh-huh. Louis Graves: More importantly he built a hospital and paid doctors to leave their practices in Mexico City and come here. He made possible a park for the children. He supports the poorest families, and this is only a smidgen of what he has done. And as for the Armani suits, I have seen Senor Guerra weep because he feels without them he is not enough of a man. He once told me "If only I could wear rags and still hold my head just as high." And I said to him "It is not the clothes, but the tears one wears which make the man." A plaque of those words now hangs over his closet. Walter Pool: Mm. I don't know. Louis Graves: A rare opportunity, Walter. A chance to make a lot of money and make the world a better place. You must decide. Walter Pool: Okay. Okay, look. If Jose Guerra wants me to kill a man he's got to ask me himself. I'm that easily bought, amigo. I don't care what he pays. You got to make Guerra understand, I'd be doing him a big favor, because I'm taking a big risk. Louis Graves: You have your pride, the sort of guy Senor Guerra admires, but maybe too much for what he asks of you. You'd have to meet secretly. You can't be seen together. Walter Pool: As long as we're eyeball to eyeball. Louis Graves: I will talk to Senor Guerra. If he says yes I will find you in the cantina tomorrow. If he says no best of luck, amigo. [Spanish]. Walter Pool: Shit. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Shit. My glasses? Dear Lucy, I probably blew 100,000 dollars today. I lied you see, and now I got to decide. If he comes tomorrow, that is. I hope he doesn't but if he does, I hope he does. [inaudible] - Oh, shit. Ohhh, shit. Uhh. Louis Graves: Follow me. ♪ It's my job. Walter Pool: You got to do what you got to do. Louis Graves: All right. Senor Guerra will make his decision, and then so will you. Good luck amigo. Jose Guerra: Those are bloodstains on your shirt. Walter Pool: Cleanest one I have. Jose Guerra: Yes. I see your point. Looking at you Senor Pool, I take it you never had a son. You do not have the look of a father, at least one who has devoted himself heart and soul to... No, I must not take it upon myself to judge or disparage your character. How could I do so when I consider using your very character for my own ends? Really, we are more the same than different. It's only a matter of degrees and appearances. However, where I am one to cling to those degrees and appearances, you seem to spite them, to say they do not matter. We both take such stances to sustain identities for ourselves, and in doing so, we are both essentially dishonest. Walter Pool: I don't know about any of that stuff. I don't think, I just kill. Jose Guerra: Very good answer Senor Pool, for it is the answer which brings you closer to acquiring 100,000 American dollars and the life you believe you seek. Walter Pool: I don't think I understand you. Jose Guerra: Oh, yes you do. You see, I've been, my compadres I should say, have been watching you for the past few weeks and they've been reporting back to me. We determined that you were desperate, so much so that it was almost animal. You were a stranger, spoke to no one in the entire town. Walter Pool: I'm a very private guy. Jose Guerra: Exactly. You seem to be the perfect candidate for my purposes, and when you told Louis that you had already killed, and you liked it, well, you see, I had prayed for a man like you to cross my path. You can imagine the kind of anticipation your presence created in me, but then last night Louis tells me that you are too proud to just take the money. You wanted to speak to me personally, and your whole body shook. Walter Pool: Yeah, well, I get excited. Jose Guerra: Nonsense. So now I meet you as you requested to decide if you are capable of the job. A true mercenary who can kill efficiently, take the money without remorse, keep forever silent. So to find this out, I intend to penetrate to the core of who you are. Walter Pool: There's no penetrating me, Guerra. Jose Guerra: Do you mean to say that you are impenetrable, or that there is nothing to penetrate? Walter Pool: There's nothing to penetrate here, pal. Jose Guerra: That's your first mistake, Senor Pool. A man who is a simple honest killer is I believe, an essentially shallow creature with little or nothing to penetrate, just what you claim you are. But the right answer was to say "I'm impenetrable.", because no person with the strength of pride you demonstrated to Louis last night would ever think of himself of having little or nothing to penetrate. So, by answering in such a way as you did, you revealed yourself to be a man of some perception and depth, who is conscious of wanting to be seen as a shallow and merciless killer, so much so that he quite obviously contradicts his true nature which he has already clearly and impulsively demonstrated. Therefore, you cannot in my opinion be truly mercenary. It's been a pleasure meeting you though. I feel sorry for you that you did not work out. Walter Pool: Wait! What do you mean by that? Jose Guerra: By what? Walter Pool: By being sorry for me? Jose Guerra: I meant it's a shame. Walter Pool: A shame? Wait, look, look, look, look. Look, I know about your plan to kill Herberto Ortega. Now to keep me quiet you're going to have to send someone after me, too. You can't let me live. All of a sudden I got to beg for my own goddamn life, don't I? Don't I? Jose Guerra: If you knew what it is to lose your only son, defiled in such a manner, and then to watch Maria, my beloved wife, who I knew since childhood, watch her die within only months after of nothing but grief... Walter Pool: I'm sorry. Jose Guerra: If you could know what I feel, you would forgive me. Walter Pool: Oh, I forgive you. Jose Guerra: I'm sorry Senor Pool, it's only an unfortunate circumstance that it did not work out. Walter Pool: Look, just hear me out. If it's a matter of life or death how could you expect me not to kill Herberto Ortega? Don't you see? Now I got to kill him. See, once I've got blood on my hands I won't talk. Don't you see? Jose Guerra: I cannot be certain. Walter Pool: My own survival instinct guarantees it. I mean, just look at me. If I didn't have a hell of a survival instinct I would have killed myself probably a long time ago. Jose Guerra: Let us test that instinct. And to think that you came in here pretending to be on equal footing with me. Walter Pool: What? Jose Guerra: Take your hands off me and get on your hands and knees, my gringo cucaracha. Do it, or I'll walk out the door. Put you face on the floor. Walter Pool: I'm not doing that. Jose Guerra: I will not say it again. Now, Louis says that you told him that you were doing ME a favor. Not only do I offer you an immense amount of money, but now I also spare your life. So tell me, my cucaracha, who is doing who a favor? Walter Pool: You are. Jose Guerra: What? Walter Pool: You are. Jose Guerra: You may live. You know, when I think of my son's confirmation into the church, the pride and hopefulness in his eyes, and then an instant later, I cannot help but remember how he was, uh... I cannot stand to see a man lose his dignity. It makes me sick! Yes, you've convinced me of giving you the job and you shall live, but my estimation of you is little. Louis will give you the details. [inaudible]: My prayers are with you. Walter Pool: Fuck your prayers. Jose Guerra: Very good, Senor Pool. Already you are coming back among the living. I am pleased. Louis Graves: Once the job is finished there's no need to contact us. We will know. I will meet you in the cave shortly after midnight tomorrow. You'll be paid all your money and then you must make yourself disappear very far from Santiago. Ortega lives in the hills just outside of town. Walter Pool: Jesus, Walter. Louis Graves: You can't do that Walter. Walter Pool: I didn't mean to. Louis Graves: All alone. No servants, not even body guards. This we do not understand. ♪ Herberto Ortega: [Spanish] Walter Pool: I'm lost. I was exploring the woods. Uh, sorry if I bothered you. Herberto Ortega: Who are you? Walter Pool: Name's... just Joe. I'm from New Jersey. Uh, it's my first time visiting Mexico. Herberto Ortega: Have a seat, Joe. Enjoy the fire. My name is Herberto Ortega. Please, I've been up here alone for many days now. I welcome the company. Walter Pool: Okay. Uh, thank you. [inaudible]: I mean, uh, sure. Ooo, that is a nice fire. So you like 'em? Herberto Ortega: What? Walter Pool: Fires? Herberto Ortega: Yes, very much. If you were worth the money they paid you, I would have been dead minutes ago. Walter Pool: What? Herberto Ortega: Please. I am unarmed, my hands are visible. Please do what you came for. Walter Pool: You shouldn't have done what you did to that kid. Herberto Ortega: You mean Jose Guerra Junior? Walter Pool: Ah, so you admit it. Herberto Ortega: I admit nothing, but please don't let that keep you from pulling the trigger. Walter Pool: What do you mean, you admit nothing? Herberto Ortega: I mean I neither murdered nor raped Jose Guerra Junior. Walter Pool: Yeah, well with the people I talked to there seems to be no question about it. There's a witness who saw you with the kid, and I hear you've done this before, like other places. Herberto Ortega: They're liars. Walter Pool: Uh-huh. Well you're the guy with the gun in your face. I think you have a little more reason to lie, so put your hands in the air. Fact is, I don't care who killed the kid, so just close your eyes, and we'll get this over with. Come on, close your eyes. Herberto Ortega: If I wait for you to shoot I'm more likely to starve to death. What nonsense. What did they pay you to do this, two pesos? Walter Pool: Shut up. Herberto Ortega: You want to know who killed the boy? Walter Pool: No. Shut up. Herberto Ortega: The man who hired you. Walter Pool: That's bullshit. I mean, I don't like the guy, but I could tell he loved his son. Herberto Ortega: He loved what he dreamed his son would be, however he ended up grieving the boy before he was even dead. Walter Pool: Don't expect me to buy any of that. Herberto Ortega: Poor Senor Guerra. He had the horrifying discovery that his only son was a maricon. Walter Pool: A what? Herberto Ortega: A faggot. Walter Pool: A faggot? So that's why you raped him? Herberto Ortega: I would not call it a rape. The night it happened a friend of Guerra's said he saw the boy and I in a very compromising position. I left the boy, and soon after Guerra arrived and said he found his son strangled. When I left minutes before, young Jose was very much alive. I believe Guerra was watching us. It was then that his suspicions about his son were confirmed. Walter Pool: You disgust me. That kid was 16 years old and you- Herberto Ortega: And if it was a 16 year old girl, you and most of your kind would be slapping me on the back. Walter Pool: So then why'd you buy off the courts and the police, huh? Herberto Ortega: To get a fair investigation. In this country you need money for such a thing. Walter Pool: I don't believe a word you're saying. Herberto Ortega: I suppose my various passions have led me down immoral paths but somehow I do not feel I did wrong. Perhaps Guerra doesn't feel he did wrong either. He loved his son too much, really himself too much, to believe that his son was truly a maricon. The boy was better saved in death than to be disgraced and destroyed in life. The poor man. The pride of watching his son follow in his footsteps was his whole raison d'etre. Walter Pool: His what? Herberto Ortega: Reason to be. Most never find it though. Their attempts at alchemy, ultimately fail. They yearn for something simple and certain that they can cling to, yet their lives are grey and ambiguous and just unravel and unravel until they cannot control how or do not even notice it happening until it is too late. Then they are filled with regret, for something, they do not even know what... I have tried many things, Joe. Tried to remain open to all the possibilities of my nature. Hoping for gold, but finding mostly empty indulgence. I thought I had found it, but now I do not think so. Perhaps the boy, who I led away from his fear... and to his death. I should have known. But you, Joe. Walter Pool: Uh, Walter. Herberto Ortega: Walter? Tell me, Walter, what is yours? Walter Pool: My raison blech? Herberto Ortega: Yes. Walter Pool: I don't know. I just sort of ran away. Herberto Ortega: From what? Walter Pool: A regular life. Herberto Ortega: Oh. Are you like so many? You run away from a regular life and then yearn for it? Yearn for what they do not want. Walter Pool: Yearn for what I do not want. Yeah. I just had to get away. Maybe write. I don't know. It's kind of vague I guess, huh? I just wanted to test myself. Herberto Ortega: By killing? Walter Pool: Look, Herberto, if I don't kill you I'm most likely a dead man. Herberto Ortega: So you want to write? Walter Pool: Did you hear what I just said? Herberto Ortega: Yes, I hear you. So you want to write? Walter Pool: Yes. Herberto Ortega: Novels? Walter Pool: Yeah. Herberto Ortega: Why come here to do that? Walter Pool: I don't know. The romantic thing, I guess. You know, Hemingway, Malcolm Lowry, Graham Greene. Herberto Ortega: Graham Greene? Walter Pool: Yeah, you like his stuff? Herberto Ortega: I knew him. Walter Pool: No. Herberto Ortega: He used to play poker with my father. Walter Pool: You knew Graham Greene? Herberto Ortega: Yeah, quite well. He would come here and we would play cards and talk- Walter Pool: Ah! Ho! Herberto Ortega: I did not know Graham Greene, Walter. Walter Pool: Ho. Herberto Ortega: Get up. Walter Pool: Don't, don't, don't, don't shoot me. I would never have killed you. I'm just a claims adjuster from New Jersey, man. Herberto Ortega: Silencio. Now, if I may please have you turn away so I can have these moments to myself. There are many reasons for this Walter, more than you could know. But I am tired of waiting. [gun shot] Walter Pool: Oh, man. Why is everybody so nuts? [inaudible]: (whispering to himself) Louis Graves: Walter! Walter Pool: Over here! Now listen up. I want you to walk no more than 30 feet, and throw that case of money in the direction of my voice, then walk away. Then when I've verified it's all there, you guys drive away. Any deviation from that plan, and I start shooting. Louis Graves: Come on Walter. This is no way to treat your amigo. Walter Pool: Amigo my ass. You just do what I say. Louis Graves: Okay. I'll do what you ask. Walter Pool: Okay, you can go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow! Louis Graves: Even if we made Ortega look like an accident or a suicide- Walter Pool: It was a suicide! Louis Graves: Even so, there are people, powerful people, who would ask what really happened to Herberto? But there's no one to ask what really happened to Walter? Or even where is Walter? Walter Pool: Mm-mmm (negative). Louis Graves: I know I said I was your amigo, and now you know I shouldn't have. But I do feel shame Walter. I could have one of these guys pull the trigger, but I'm going to do it myself so you can look in my eyes and see that it is done with a sad heart. It's a first time for both of us. Mine to kill, and more significantly, yours to die. So please, Walter, spit in my face. I lied to you and said I was your friend, now please, spit in my face. Then that is how it is. Walter Pool: Louis, Louis please listen. Louis, I did not kill Ortega, he shot himself. I swear. Louis Graves: If it's any consolation, this money will instead be used to build a pediatric ward at Santiago Hospital. Now, I ask you, Walter, how is that money better spent? On little ones who've not been given even one chance in life, or on a tired killer, who's been given many? Walter Pool: Well. Louis Graves: Though I just met you, I will miss you. I have an epigram for the occasion. I know you'd probably rather not hear it considering I wrote it but, it could be some comfort. "Where there is no ground, there is no bottom." You understand that? Walter Pool: Yeah. It's stupid. Louis Graves: Hopefully in death, you'll never have to hit bottom again. Walter Pool: Oh, no. [2 gun shots] [wind chimes] [radio playing] Walter Pool: Por favor.

So I tried the internet, hoping to meet more people but the only person on the internet with anything interesting to say was this fat girl from Iceland. I mean, I don't know if she was fat, she didn't say she was fat, but when I asked her what she looked like she wouldn't tell me. In Iceland it's cold, you know, they eat and drink a lot. Anyway I wanted real human contact, you know, not just some computer screen spewing out EMF's, that's electromagnetic fields, and like I said, I'm on the computer all day so I can't concentrate enough to read and I hate fucking TV, except for the Discovery Channel. Shit I'm sorry. I hope my language doesn't upset you. Anyway what I wanted to do was write. Write, write, write, so I thought well, I'll do the drudge work by day, and I'll write by night, like Kafka. And like I said, I'm on the computer all day, so my fingers hurt and I became exhausted and... You know to be honest, I never wrote a word except the claims reports. And the job, the job just wore me out so I tried vitamins, I took garlic pills and I worked out for about a week, and then of course there was Lucy. She worked in the office with me and we were engaged and she was very nice, and I guess I loved her, but you know, I tried to explain to her I was in hell, and I know she tried to understand. But then one day I actually... I actually heard her humming along with the muzak, some beautiful butchered Beatles tune and I realized she actually liked it, and that's when I knew I had to go, and I don't mean just like get out of town or change jobs, break off the relationship or go back to school or get therapy. But I mean I had to get the fuck out. Because you know, deep down inside myself... I mean, I thought... if I was going to be miserable, it would have to be on my own terms, by myself but even that, you know, even that... What a crybaby. The shit I talk. I mean, you don't understand half of what I'm saying and there you were all poor, maybe you hadn't eaten in a week and I'm talking about muzak. Well at least now I've got real problems to match the way that I feel. Lourdes: I understand. Walter Pool: I know you do. I feel I've known you, I mean really known you for a long time now. Lourdes: Other men say that to me also. Walter Pool: Oh, but, I'm not one of them, I'm not like them. I left all that behind, I am not one of 'em. Lourdes: Please move your hand. Walter Pool: I'm sorry. I just felt I could do that and it would be okay. Lourdes: You eat the food. Walter Pool: Who owns this place? Lourdes: The man that I will marry. Walter Pool: Who is he? I mean, who could be rich enough... Never mind. I don't want to know. Lourdes: So you eat and I will go, and you can ask Juanita if you need for her to help you. She's the maid. I'll come back tomorrow and you can stay here until you get more better. Maybe some days, is okay. Walter Pool: You're doing it for the money, aren't you? Lourdes: What? Walter Pool: Marrying this guy. Lourdes: You don't know me and you say this to me? Walter Pool: I'm sorry. Lourdes: I don't marry any man for money. Walter Pool: Bullshit. ♪ Jose Guerra: [Spanish] Quien eres? Oh, you are the American guest. Don't I know you? Walter Pool: Not a sound. Jose Guerra: Who are you? Walter Pool: An avenging angel. They can't see you in the dark. Jose Guerra: Senor Pool? Walter Pool: That's right Guerra. You remembered. I'm flattered. Jose Guerra: I would have remembered you immediately- Walter Pool: Except you thought I was dead. I told you I have a hell of a survival instinct. Now tell me, what didn't you tell her tonight? Jose Guerra: Who? Walter Pool: Lourdes. When you were naked. Jose Guerra: You saw? Walter Pool: Yeah. Were you going to tell her you killed your son? Nobody else knows, huh? Just me. Jose Guerra: Yes, please, see that I'm in hell for what I've done. Let me live, let me live so that I can suffer and confront it. Walter Pool: You're confronting it right now. Understand, I'm not buying this "let me live and I shall suffer" bullshit. Jose Guerra: Of course not. You know that I'm a dishonest man, one that is even more inclined to lie under the present circumstance. Walter Pool: There you have it! You deserve to die. Jose Guerra: Ahhhh... Walter Pool: Okay. You have a choice. You can probably save your life if you bolt now, and you'll look great with an eye patch. Jose Guerra: Today, you may find life impossible unless you have your vengeance, but tomorrow, you might be glad to live without it. Walter Pool: I'll live happily ever after with it. Jose Guerra: Perhaps, except that you shall not live at all. It's four o'clock in the morning. In one hour the sun shall rise and my body guards shall see my corpse and they shall hunt you down. How far do you expect you can go? Walter Pool: God, I hate the sun. Jose Guerra: The wisest course would be to let me go. Take the chance that I shall honor my word when I say I shall not retaliate. Walter Pool: I'm calling the shots now. I have the power, not you. Jose Guerra: The kind of power that's motivated only by the lack of power. Walter Pool: That was stupid, Guerra. That's a small but critical vein I'm touching now. Jose Guerra: I'm only speaking honestly, so that you will know that you can believe me when I say that if you allow me to live, I shall do the same for you. What does causing your own annihilation solve? Walter Pool: It solves life. Jose Guerra: You don't want die. You'd rather live in your own misery than die. In that we are the same. Do not harm her. Because of her I can change, Walter. Only a month ago I found myself at the church, ready to confess all my crimes to the padre, but I did not. I looked at this man I ruled with my altruism, and I did not know him, or trust him. I escaped from my body guards and I went to the plaza and I sat on the bench, feeling more alone than I've ever felt. I don't know how long I sat there, but suddenly I felt compelled to look up and I saw those two eyes looking at me. A stranger's eyes, but yet they understood, felt everything that I was feeling and I realized this was no stranger, though I'd never seen her before that moment. Walter Pool: Yeah, but you're afraid of her. If you told her all you've done you could lose her. Jose Guerra: Yes. Walter Pool: So call her over. Jose Guerra: Why? Walter Pool: Do it. Jose Guerra: Lourdes. Vente. Lourdes: Jose? Jose Guerra: Si, vente. What are you going to do? Not me, you. You're going to get it all off your chest. All your crimes. Jose Guerra: Please I cannot. Walter Pool: It's your only choice. You tell her in English so I can understand. One sound and he dies. I'm sorry, but you'll understand once you hear what he has to say. Get down, put your ear against his mouth. I promise I won't hurt you. Jose Guerra: I killed my son. Lourdes: Que? Jose Guerra: I killed my son. I killed him with my own hands. Walter Pool: Everything! Jose Guerra: This man, on my orders, was shot, so now he cannot walk. Walter Pool: You're carrying his second child. Think he won't do it again? It's up to you. Do I let him go, or do I kill him? Lourdes: Let him go. Jose Guerra: You love me. Walter, you are an angel, but not an avenging one. Walter Pool: I don't believe this shit. Lourdes: No! Jose Guerra: Si, goddamn it, si! Lourdes: No. ♪ Walter Pool: Dear Lucy, Lucy, shit whatever happened to you? You seem so long ago. Guess what? I'm not writing my novel yet. You know, I don't think I want to be a writer after all. All I know is the asshole was right. I want to live no matter what. If you ever see me again, Lucy, you'll probably feel sorry for me, but don't. I'm going to be okay. Till then, Walter. ♪
