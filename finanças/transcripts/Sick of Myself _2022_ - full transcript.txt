2006 Richebourg Grand Cru Domaine Leroy. - $2300 per bottle. - Yes. That's fine. It's my girlfriend's birthday. So it'd be great if you didn't yell out the price. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Can I pour myself, if that's OK? I don't want to steal your job, but handling such a fine bottle is rare. Can I keep the cork, too? Sorry for bothering you. Thanks. Let me know if there's anything. Thank you. And now... Take your phone, pretend to get a call, and go outside. - Now? - Yes, now. Everybody's watching me. Are you that big of a narcissist? They don’t care. Relax, Signe. Hi, it's Signe. Yes.. I'll call you back. Happy birthday. There we go. Wow, this is really nice! Do it again. - Take the call again. - They're actually staring now. Because you got a dessert? Signe, do it now! - OK. - Yeah? If we tell them that I did it. What? That you took the bottle? Yes, at the party. Sure. That's funny. - Deal? - You took it. Hey! Stop! Hey! God damn it! BERENTSEN Narcissists are the ones who make it. A lot of people make it, narcissism is not a prerequisite. Combined with talent, it's a plus. If that's true, if narcissism is a career booster... then why do you work at a cafe? Because l'm not a narcissist. People tell me ali the time: "You should start a podcast, you're so naturally funny". Who says that? Lots of people... Thomas! How are you? Where's Signe during all of this? She went ahead. I was sitting there all alone... How much? What was the price, Signe? $2300. $2300? That's steep. An expensive bottle. Kind of. - Well, I sell it by the glass. - Oh, I see. Double americano? Call an ambulance! Are you OK? Are you injured? - Um, I just... - Do you have any injuries? No. - What happened? - I got bit. An instinct just kicked in. But no one was helping. Just me. They just watched. Good thing you intervened. It was brave of you. I wish more people did. That's all I need from you. You probably want to go clean off. Yes. Do that. Thank you. - Thanks. - Goodbye. Are you all right? It's OK, l'm fine. Hello. Are you hungry? No. I thought about ordering Chinese... crispy duck. But they only take orders for two people. Sure you don't want a piece if I order some? Signe! Signe, did you hear me? What happened? There was an accident... An accident at work. Sit down! Where are you bleeding? Huh? I don't see a wound.. - It was a dog. - A dog? A woman got bit. I think I saved her! - Did it bite you? - I don't know. I just... It all happened so fast. I don't recall if... You know if a dog bit you. Maybe. Is this your blood? It may be. I don't know. Signe, you know if this is your own blood! Is it? Maybe not... You have to tell me that. I got scared! I was really close, so... It happened at work, and you walked home like this? Yes. So, tell me, then. What happened? I've always felt I'd do good in a terror situation. It's just in my nature. Good thing you were there. Well done. I was the only one who helped. - Everybody just watched. - That's crazy. No, stand back! Somebody should write about it. Could be something for VG News? I'd do an interview. For your sake. It's not really how it works. They said she'd probably die, if it wasn't for me. Wow. that's crazy. Poor thing. No, l'm fine. The police and medics told me she probably would've died, if it wasn't for me. How are you? Still in shock? Yeah, I mean... It's still there... - It's been what, 2 weeks? - Yes. But it comes back to me every day at work. I get queasy just talking about blood. See, that thing puzzles me. Isn't empathy stronger than the aversion to blood? I probably would have intervened. Not to completely change the subject, but... Can I run some titles by you? For my exhibition. - Yeah! At Cotar, huh? - "Cotard", right. - That's great. Congrats! - Thanks. Yeah, well... Not the real Cotard. It's a side gallery. Good to know, so you don't get lost. A gallery elsewhere? It is Cotard but they're opening a temporary gallery downtown. They're putting on some shows this summer. And it's a bit smaller. Size-wise, yes. Could be a good thing. Even with a small turnout, it'll look full. Still it's prestigious to do a show at Cotard. Cotard. - Yeah. I think so. - L’m touched. What titles do you have? At the moment I guess l'm leaning tovvards... 17.-27. Juni COTARD (OSLO) Why do Norwegian artists exhibiting in Norway. Always pick English titles? I mean, that's just... That’s the language we use. It’s an international scene. THE DAMAGE (In Norwegian) Thomas! Thomas? I'll be outside... Didn't... a famous architect design this house? Excuse me... Hello. Any allergies that the kitchen needs to know about? Yes. What kind? Nut allergy. How severe? Even indirect contact? - Yes. - I see. That'll require extra work. I'll notify them. But you don't? I do. It's a pretty serious allergy, then? But you still feel comfortable going to dinners like this? Yes. I try not to let it run my life, just live as normally as I can. We'll have to be careful then, so you don't die on us. Have you had it for a long time? It's a bit difficult to talk about. Thanks for asking, though. Are you Thomas’ sister? No. I'm his girlfriend. Interesting. He didn't say. He's a bit private, that man. Are you an artist as well? Um, no... I just noticed the paint stains on your dress. Excuse me. That food contains nuts. Your brother's food has nuts in it. Did you eat a lot of it? What's going on? She ate from the wrong plate, so she ate nuts. It wasn’t a lot. - Are you OK? - It's fine. - Do you need any help? - No. Don’t you have any allergy pills? You have to be careful. Just to be clear, all the plates were in the right place. She has a life-threatening nut allergy. Don't take any chances. - You're scaring her. - It's fine. I can feel it now. Have some water. Please... Please, Signe... I'm sorry. Jesus. You all saw her eating from his plate, right? I was very cautious. It's fine. Don't worry. Should we call someone? No! There's no need. We'd rather not. You're feeling better, right? It seems like... Yes, l'm better. - Are you OK? - It was just a mild reaction. Sure? Thomas takes care of me. - Idiot! - No, you're not. I forget. People always tell me l'm a scatterbrain. But anyway, I was just thinking - I’m trying to recall who designed this building. What was his name again? I don't know. - It was Jan Inge Hovig. - Jan Inge Hovig! Of course! I knew it was someone like him. I'm not gonna steal all the attention... But can I borrow some? Is that OK? I'm not much for the spotlight, so l'll shine it on Eivind instead and say thanks, for finding me, and taking me in one December night when I was in fetal position outside of Cotard. No, l'll try to be serious... and say something meaningful. Being an artist is in its essence a lonely endeavor. What? - That one. - Please, no... They won't notice if one is missing. I can't... I have to be mentally prepared. You're alone in the studio, patting your own back. You have to cheer yourself on, because no one else will. I simply accepted this loneliness while making art as a necessary evil. Until the day Eivind saw me. He saw my art, and elevated it to the place where it belongs: An international art context. He placed it in what I regard as the boldest gallery in Northern Europe. - And that's Cotard. - Oh! Signe! You have to get this under control! - Call an ambulance. - I'm on it. Wake up. Hello! Call an ambulance right now! Are they coming? I'll just finish the speech... The speech?! While your sister's choking? I'm trying to wrap it up! Wanna bite me? Yeah? Come on, bite me! What are you doing? Just playing with him. You're taunting my dog. That's animal cruelty. No, I didn't... Would you like it if I did this to you? - What are you... - Fucking bitch! - I was playing with her. - This is a living being! I was playing with it. - Cunt! - What did you say? Cunt. Get lost! Don't walk around tormenting animals. No, shut up! Go home! Find something to do! Get a life! Stop abusing animals. Where is that... Oh, OK... - What was that? - Nothing. What were you watching? Seriously, it was nothing. Oh, you don't slam it shut unless it's something. -Let me see, then -No. You refuse to show me? It was nothing. Just googling. What about you? "Just googling". Let me see. No. Maybe it was private. Porn? We don’t have to share everything just because we live together. We can share our porn at least. - Come on. - No! - Don't be embarrassed. - You're overplaying it. I'm curious. What kind of porn are you watching in broad daylight? Let me see. - Let me see... - Stop it! Signe? Long time. - Everything good? - Huh? Yes. I'd say. Nice to see you again. - Just follow me. - Who is it? It's for me, mom! I know you don't believe me, but... I didn't mean to send you that photo. We don't have to talk about that. I matched with a girl on Tinder, and we started talking. She asked me to send her a pic where I tried to suck myself off. And you got it by mistake. Yes, you've explained that. So embarrassing. I mean... sending that to the wrong person. Her name was Siri, so... Her name was right below yours. So I sent it by mistake. You almost reached it. Yeah. I can reach it, actually. Impressive. It's just hard to snap a photo at the same time. So... what do you need? - Ritalin, again? - No. I want... Never heard of it. I don't even know if it's available, but... I wanted to ask you, since you're good at finding stuff. Sure, l'll look. What is it? It's... It's a bit hard to explain... Kind of like Xanax, but stronger. How do you spell it? L-l-D-E-X-O-L. Are you still with.. Thomas? Yep. And it's all good? Yes, all good. But... not entirely perfect? Yes. It's great. I couldn't be happier. OK... This one? Yes. Looks a bit... Russian? Yeah. Take a pick. That one. And that one. Take everything. - All of them? - Yeah. - I'll get some, too. - No! No, that's not your thing. I've just had this intense anxiety lately. My head is rushing. The point is, that's some heavy stuff. I like you, Signe. But... I really don't mind doing this for you. But... Can we hang out with my mom for a little bit? Huh? She's just on me all the time about how l'm not seeing enough people, and so on. So maybe we could just have a cup of coffee... I don't have time for that. Sorry. Good. Studying, still? Here and there. Oh, that's enough! Signe! D2 Magazine wrote to me! They want to do an interview. Cool, huh? Are you sleeping? Have you seen my charger? Seen my charger? No. Whoa! What happened? Your arm. Oh shit! You haven't noticed it? No! Oh my God! And there, too. On your face. For real? Oh, fuck. Do you think it's serious? I'd get it checked. Do you think it's serious? Looks like a rash. Weird that you haven't noticed. It looks pretty serious, doesn't it? I'd go to the doctor. Because you're worried? Yeah, get it checked. Where is this rash? Mostly on the arm. Can you take off your jacket? No. No? Can't we just talk about it? No, I need to see the rash to diagnose it. I don't feel like taking off my jacket. Why can't you take it off? I'm not going to. OK? I'm not going to! Let's just talk. My boyfriend is picking me up soon, anyway. Can I ask where you got all this furniture from? Flea markets! Just got lucky. Thomas? Thomas! What's going on? D2 Magazine is here. They're taking photos of me. Weren't you gonna pick me up? - Pick you up? - At the doctor's. Take the tram downtown to go back with you? Yes. I misunderstood, then. How about answering the phone? I was in the middle of an interview. It was an interview. I couldn't just walk away. Aren't you gonna ask how it went? Yes... how did it go? It went on forever. They did a lot of testing OK, good. They didn't find the cause. It's good you got tested. At least that's done. I was thinking maybe... Check this out. Lift your chin a little. Can you put your hand under your chin? Great. Got it. All good, Signe? Tired? I got a studio visit with the National Museum next week. For real? Congrats! Anything to show them? Nothing. Everything is at Cotard. I thought maybe you could help. How about using this furniture? No, this is private stuff. I don't want to use it. A small favor? I won't help you steal. Thomas? Yes? Is anyone here? Yngve is here. Can you come here for a sec? I'm busy, Signe. Just keep sleeping. It's only 4 PM, after all. If it's about credit, we can work it out. Hi, Yngve. I've got a majör headache. I need some water. Got any painkillers? What happened? Come with us. We'll take you to the ambulance, then the hospital. Thomas? Hi, Signe. I've looked at the results. It's quite shocking. You've apparently abused illegal drugs. That's the reason you've gotten sick. We see a general pattem... You lie a lot. You have a bad personality. Not the coolest person at parties. Your sense of humor is bad as well. Particularly how you... perform racist caricatures in the mirror for your own amusement. I haven't seen that on a CT scan for quite some time. When we find this much, we simply have to call the police. They're outside and ready to immediately execute you. Are you all right? Should we stop? Where does it hurt? Your head burns? I refuse! It's not contagious, right? How many times are you gonna ask? Have you told anyone about this? No. If anyone asks, tell them l'm in the hospital. And that it's severe. Are people asking about me? No... not really. I guess I haven't been here that long. I'm sorry that I didn't take it seriously right away. I should have listened to you. Yes. What matters is you're here for me now. Caring for me. D2 Magazine came out today. Got you a copy. Thought you'd like something to read. It turned out nicely. Thomas The Thief I mentioned you, too. Not by name, but indirectly. Signe? - Hi. - Hi. Where's Anine? She couldn't make it, but she sends her best wishes. They asked me to talk to you. That you're not cooperative. Mom, they put me in weird machines and refuse to tell me if they're dangerous. - You understand? - Sweetie. It hurts seeing you like this. You're not doing well. You're not doing well We'll get you out of here. And then you’ll go to The Holistic Center. Promise? They really helped me. It's where I met Hilde. The one who was a witch for a while, remember? I need some more sleep. Think about it. And that was it? 56 messages and a few visits... and then life goes on? If I die, make sure Anine doesn't come to the funeral. Funeral guest list, huh. Yeah. Not my dad, either. I don't want people there who don't really care. What would I do without you? What are you doing? What do you think? It's a bit weird. Come on. Thomas. Undress. It's weird with the mask. Don't think about it. All those bandages. Thomas, don't think about it. - You all right? - Yes. - Ask me again? - About what? How I'm doing. - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Want me to care for you? - Yes. I've been really worried about you. I've worried about you dying. I thought about your funeral... Tell me about the funeral! There are so many people, there's a line outside the church. People flying in from abroad, trying to get into the funeral. Is my dad there? Yes, but he can't get in. He's stopped at the door. - Anine Olsen? - Sorry. - But l'm a close friend! - Not on the list, sorry. I'll have to take care of this line now. Well... We've got someone new here today, Signe. Can you say it, Signe? Signe. There you go. Tell us about yourself, Signe. How do you feel these days? Yes. Um.. I have a skin disease. No one knows what it is. Seems like l'm the first person in the world who has it. The doctors were lining up to see me. They almost didn't let me leave. My mom recommended this place. Signe's mom is Beate. You remember her? I work at a bakery. I mean... I'm the manager. I have a boyfriend. Thomas... Meinich. He's an artist. No? He's not the greatest boyfriend. He's become obsessed with his own career. All his energy goes to that. Of course he should enjoy the success, but... Signe, you keep talking about a person who's not here. There's no Thomas here. - But there's a Signe. - Yes. Tell us about your symptoms. Where do you feel the pain? It's not really... I'm not in great pain. It's just... I have a problem swallowing. What phase? - What? - Detox phase. 1 or 2? I don't know what that means. Maybe we should move on? Anja... Maybe someone with more severe symptoms should talk now? You think you have it worse? I wish I had your condition. How practical! Avisible illness that everyone can see! You're lucky. I’m lucky...? Come back when you've got anxiety, brain fog, migraines... diarrhea, chronic bad breath, trouble sleeping beyond 2 hours... No bright light, no loud noises... I'm sorry. I'm sorry! No! - No! - There, there... It was good to let that go. Did the doctors make you believe it’s difficult to swallow? No, it really is. Your brain's going "I have a problem swallowing". Have some water. I just... I don't know if this is my thing. When you said "my thing" my face started smiling. - Did you notice? - Yes. No one's got ownership of what happens in that room. And because it's nobody's "thing" it's everybody's thing. What you should ask is: What did Signe learn from this session? Not a lot, really. How does your face look under that hospital mask? I don't know. The doctor told me to keep it on. How do I look? Do you think, "Oh, this person is full of warmth and love”. You think? - No... - No. You know, hospital doctors love bandaging people. But what happens when you put a mushroom in a plastic bag in the sun? - It starts to rot? - Exactly. Yeah? I'm a believer in a medicine you've probably heard of: It's called fresh air. Sure you should take it off? They said it was fine. Can you take a picture of me? Let me see. Take another one. Just take some more. For what? Post it, to let everyone know. People are asking. Come on. Oh, damn... That's crazy. God... Yeah, it looks horrible. It's just more serious than I thought. Didn't mean it like that. You're still beautiful. - I can't take it anymore. - My dear... If I were to talk to a journalist about this, it'd be you. Because I look up to you. I really admire your work. Well, there are rules for that sort of thing... nepotism. - You don't think it’s too similar? - How? To my D2 interview, if you do it here too. The photos. I live here, too. You're free to do it. Just mentioning it for your sake: My article came first, and people might think it's weird that you're copying the setting. I'm not aiming for originality. It's an intimate interview. They want to see me at home. I get the concept. It's a very obvious idea. But most people might recognize this backdrop, and connect it to my art, which might not be in your interest. So "most people" read your interview so intently that the images are burned into their retinas? Just for your sake... Maybe they'll notice my face, before recognizing the walls. Are you wearing that? Lift your chin a little. Great. Can you try sitting? Yes. What? I was thinking of using this chair in my next exhibition. Which exhibition? My next one, hypothetically. And...? If you use it in this context, it kind of spoils how l'm gonna use it later. How? Not as an object that's already been in the media. What's wrong? He doesn't want me in the chair. I consider this chair part of my art. I don't want it printed in the media. After an article in VG, she went viral... and is now a world sensation. Signe, how does it feel to become world famous overnight? It's been surprising and overwhelming. I think it's good that people are talking about it. Signe, we have a surprise for you today. First off: Your father Svein. My dear girl... I'm so sorry that I haven't been there for you, like I should. After your mother and I separated. I've been completely absent. I can see that now. I'm very, very sorry. Thank you. We're also gonna bring out your friend Anine, who didn't visit at the hospital. Signe, I'm sorry that I didn't come. I didn't understand the gravity. I see that I was wrong. I hope you can forgive me. Signe, you would like to perform a song for us today. Yes. I used to sleep outside When I was closer to the real, imperfect me I thought it was Jesus when they woke me up I'm gullible like that I hope you've got room for me I'm coming all alone Struck by mysterious disease - Thomas? - Yes? Can you check VG News? See if the article is out. Can't you see for yourself? My phone is dead. OK. It's out? Active shooter in Bergen. A father shot his wife and three kids. That's VG News? Yes. It's been pushed down the page. So it's out? Yeah, but the shooting takes up all the space. Let me see. Nice photos. And you can hardly see the furniture. Hi, Marte. I saw the article. Cool! Great. I noticed it's already far down on the main page. Is it possible to bump it back up? No. So there's really nothing you can... It's just... Well, nothing to do about that. What fucking nerd shoots his whole family? Of course it's sad. It's just really bad timing. Yeah. All right. Yep. Bye. Done reading? Just a moment. Yes. Done. What do you think? Not a lot of new information to me, but... yeah. If you didn't know me, what would you think? I'd feel pity for you, and... that it must be a difficult situation. Did you like any of my quotes? It was a good interview. Well written. Are you proud of me? Yes. I am. I think you're brave, coming forward like that. Signe Struck by Mysterious Disease Lots of attention today? Best thing that happened was Lars Lillo tweeting about the article. - What did he write? - It was just a retweet. I've always been a fan of his band. Weird that he knows who I am. You're a fan of DeLillos now? Never heard you mention them. I've mentioned them a few times. What’s your favorite song? If you've always "been a fan", what's your favorite song? You think l'm lying about being a fan? I've listened to them a lot. What was the name of that dealer you had? That guy who sold us mushrooms. Who lives with his mom. Steinar? No, Stian. All right, so Stian... He died. He died? What happened? A year ago, or so... I don't know how. But he's dead. Anyway, so we buy a bag of mushrooms... Stian? Hi! Remember me? Marte. I've been at your place. Oh. Nice. I thought you were dead? OK...? Signe told me you were dead. No... I'm not. So the whole "victim" thing is a lie She lies about everything. Once she claimed she was missing a toe. Months later she wore sandals. All her toes were there. She denied ever saying it. - Will this go on print? - Oh yeah. Oh my god! Signe? What happened? Hey. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm fine. You're shaking. It's fine. All good. Sit down. - What is it? - Leg cramp. - Should we call someone? - No, no. Just let me... Hello. Thomas The Thief Excuse me. Can I talk to you outside? Why? - And my mom... - What? You gave it to Mona? Of course! She has insomnia, we talked about it, remember? I told you not to buy it! Get your hands off me! A bit too far away, Nora. Sorry. That's OK. That's it. Thanks. Thank you. But let me say... These photos: They're fantastic. Thanks. I directed them myself, kind of. Really? Is what I see on your face represented on your body as well? Yes. Mostly on the upper body. I think it's beautiful. Really. You think? Thanks. I've worked in fashion my entire adult life. At some point, I got so fed up. All those skinny bodies and symmetrical faces... - I was sick and tired of it. - I know what you mean. So when I started an agency, I wanted to do it differently and focus on inclusivity. It's about time. Right? Globally, l'm not the first. But in Scandinavia, no one in this business is as forward-looking as me. I want to advance a culture where people like you don't get discriminated. Does your disease have a name? No, they haven't managed to diagnose it yet. But... Does it affect your health? No, apart from how I look, I'm healthy. Excuse me. No problem. - Could I have some water? - Absolutely. Nora, can you get Signe some water? Water is over here, you know? - Nora... - I'm sorry. It happens. But just try to... It would be easier if things had permanent homes. - What? - Fixed places would be easier. That's a great suggestion. I'll make a note of it. Is this related to your condition? Modeling can be very demanding. To be honest, I haven't been doing too great, lately. An opportunity like this would give me a reason to go on living. Signe... you're bleeding from the mouth. Nora, can you get some paper? Let me see. You're actually bleeding. Has this happened before? - No. - OK. How embarrassing. Not at all, but... Where's the bathroom? Down the hall, to the right. No, Nora. It's too late now. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. Fuck... I see. That's OK. Exactly. Didn't you send it? Yes. Yes, great! Great. Thank you. Goodbye. OK, Signe. Let's do it like this: If you sign a contract saying I have no legal responsibility for your health, I won't ask any more questions. Signe? I don’t know how to put this... I know how busy you are with your modeling and all of that, but... What is it? Tell me. I'm trying... Please hear me out before you respond. All right... I was thinking... I want my next exhibition to be about you. Based on your face That's cute, but my schedule... That's cute, but my sthedule... Yes, I know. The Balenciaga shoot in Tokyo... I know all that, but it would mean the world to me. Lisa wants me to be very selective about projects... I get that. I have to listen to her, she's my agent. I'm so inspired by your story. You're my muse. - I'll call her. - You will? - I'll ask her opinion. - For real? That's all I want! I'd be in heaven! - You're so cute. - Signe... Signe! Not to change the subject completely, but... a toast to me becoming a model? Congratulations. Again. I admire your creativity Most people wouldn't jump to a modeling career after falling ill. Well, I was discovered. By an exclusive agency... You and one other model? Someone with a missing hand...? She has dysmelia. She's doing great. She's been on the cover of Costume. It's a great agency. - Cheers! - Cheers! But... Why do they... I mean, the fact that they want you... Is it related to how you look now? Oh cool... I become a model, and you ask why? I think Yngve is asking if they're looking for... I mean... There's been a trend of showcasing victims. If that... You don't think I might actually have a talent? Tell them about the assignment. The commercial? Yeah, l'm doing a commercial for... Oslo, Norway Explain what it is. It's a new Norwegian brand. Inclusive, gender-neutral clothing, in big sizes, and so on. Cloth﻿ing and...? They make clothing and bedding, and... How exactly does one make more inclusive bedding? Does anyone know? Cool thing is, the director is working on a big campaign for H&M. Wow, H&M, that's... a famous brand. We know what H&M is, Signe. And that's your reaction? Not impressed? Designed any famous buildings lately? That's uncalled for. For comparison, it's like if you designed the Eiffel Tower right after graduating. All right. It's really hot in here. Don't you agree? Isn't it weird that you can't be happy for other people? - I just think... - I’m talking to her. You'd rather not talk about my success. Signe, that's not it. It's just so much, all the time. There's no room for anything else. I'm fed up with the two of you... Why drag me into this? You're picking on her all the time! Being with the two of you is... You don't need to listen to this. I am sick! She is, actually. Didn't you have to get up early tomorrow? Yeah, we should go... You can pay over there. Fuck them. Let's not sit here and mope. What happened, Signe? I don't know. It got worse. Shouldn't you go to a doctor? Sure? Because you look... No. I'm doing fine. I think you should. But OK, come in. You're very late. Signe, can you sit down and wait for a little bit? Oh my God, Signe. I've lied to you. I didn't just randomly get sick. I did it on purpose. I look like this because l've taken huge amounts of something called Lidexol. Signe... I had a suspicion. At least you're being honest with me. You know I have to take action? If I don't report it, l'll lose my job. They’ll demand that I write a big, new article about this. I recommend we do another interview. Full transparency. Holding nothing back. I'll do anything. I just don't want to lose you as a friend. Signe, this isn't an article. This is a book.

The Sick Child Autobiography by Signe Eide What do you think? It pisses me off. It's crazy how good it is. I didn't want it to end. I dreaded finishing it. I don't know how you do it. Makes me fall in love all over again. Shit. How bad is it? The best thing for now is to avoid talking about it. I think she's self-conscious. It's a sensitive subject. I see. Just bring her in. We're already into overtime. Let's take it from there. Hello, Signe is here. - Hi. Signe. - Hi. All right. Can you remove your hood? Take off your hood. Well... Can you take her to makeup? Sure. OK? Great. Did you say something? No? Come on, Signe. Do you have an idea how to do her makeup? You... You're Signe? Hello. Andreas, the director. We do want to film her. She was late, so time's short. I'm really sorry about that. But it was out of my hands. I understand. But we've only got 2 hours left. We'll see if there's time. Is it uncomfortable? No, it's fine. I've tried my best, but it doesn't look very promising right now. You came in late. Just don't get disappointed, is all. Thank you. That's great. Andreas, can I go to the bathroom real quick? Moving on. What are we waiting for? Frida is still in the bathroom. And in the meantime? We were gonna film Signe. Yeah. I was gonna... While waiting for Frida We don't have much time. Are you ready? Yes, yes. Can you go on the podium? On the mark. Here? Should we begin? Let's begin. We'll try it with Signe this time. Let's go. Get ready. Are you sure? While we're waiting. What I want is for you to pose. Not like model cliches but... just give me some options. Hello?! That's great! Cut! Yeah, this works. Great, Signe! Nice. Next shot. You have one line. Yo have one line. Regardless means it fits me. Regardless. That's it? Just say it naturally. If you can. - Get ready. - Roll sound. Camera. ...and action! Regardless means it fits me. We'll do it again. Do you want some water? I just got something in my eye. - There. - Another one? Like I said, no sudden moves, just hold the gaze. We're still rolling? Ready? Action! Regardless means it fits me. Can we cut, please. Excuse me. That's embarrassing. I'm sorry. Are you all right? Do you want anything? I'm fine. Let's just do it again. Keep rolling. Say the line, and hold... Hold the gaze, got it. Need anything? I'm good! We'll give her one more. Let's go. Sound, camera... Ready? 234, take 2 ...and action! Regardless means it fits me. Regardless. Signe? Signe? Cut! We need help. Can you hear me? Nora, call an ambulance. Somebody help her! - What should I say? - I don’t know, just be quick! She has cramps! She's bleeding from her face! There's no time! - Put her arm down! - I'm not touching that. I don't know what's wrong. Don't involve me, I don't want the responsibility Andreas said "let's try her out". It's not my fault! Don't look at me like that! She has an unexplainable disease. She's been honest about it. That's why I made this agency. So people can see... Well, congratulations. Can someone help William? Maybe he can get some help. Take him outside. Thanks. - Hello? - Hi. Come in. I'm in the living room. What happened here? The police took everything. It's evidence. They took a lot of my stuff, too. How are things? Not good, really. Have you been avoiding me? Why don't you answer my calls? What? It's just... I've been through this in my mind so many times, trying to prepare... Just say it. I've lied to you. I didn't just randomly get sick. I actually did it on purpose. The reason I look like this is because I've taken huge amounts of something called Lidexol. Lidexol, what's that? Some really strong pills I got a hold of, that made me sick. And I knew they would. Are you kidding me? No. You've been shameless about this thing. And you don't even... That's crazy. You're insane. That's kind of privileged of you to say. But yeah... I've got a problem. - But... - So you're the victim here? Well, yeah, in a way I am! No one has free will. No one wants to be a psychopath. Not saying I am. But no one wants to have destructive urges. You know what... I think l'll just leave. This is not going anywhere. Don't go. Why on earth shouldn't I? Marte, please! Do you understand what you've done? That's why l’m crying, opening my heart... No, you're pitying yourself! What you're admitting is insane! - Marte, please! - No. It's too fucked up. Seriously. - I'm sorry! - Stop it, Signe! Stop! No! Signe Eide's debut novel "Sick of Myself" caused mayhem at today's release. She puts her finger on something. It's the sign of the times. It's evocative of "Hunger" by Knut Hamsun... It sounds wrong, but I almost wish I was sick. I came early to grab a copy. I've started detox phase 1. I've got terrible brain fog. Decreased appetite. Soreness throughout the body. I have intense mood swings. I've basically lost all my friends. Indirectly, because of the sickness. They don't wanna deal with people like us. I just hope the new drugs can help me. So I at least can look somewhat normal. But we know not to trust the doctors, right? I also vomit blood. And Thomas is in jail. I can't even see my boyfriend. The only good, safe thing I had in life is gone. It's been very emotional. I love to live! I love to live. I love to live! I love to live...
