[Rock Music Plays] If you could see how she sits, If you could see how she sits, gazing into space, a distant living glow reflected in her eyes. Who is she? Not the Silia you know, another Silia. Do you mind? 'M polishing my monologue. Skip, you're not here to polish your monologue, you're here to do a job. I told you a hundred times. This is a part-time gig until my acting career takes off. What? What? Some actors wait tables. I steal Hondas every once in awhile, so what? Can we focus on the stealing? Look, this is important, okay? I have an audition Tuesday. I'm doing Pirandello. If you could see how she sits, absorbed, gazing into space, a distant living glow reflected in her eyes. [Music] He looks like a young Steve McQueen. I hope he gets away. Hi, Tanya. Mr. Sarafanov. How are you doing? I can't complain as long as I'm doing... Are you still working for the orchestra? Of course. I happen to be on my way home right now. An acquaintance of mine happened to be at the Turin Symphony last week. Didn't see you. Or should I say, didn't hear you. Many people listen, Tanya. But not everyone can hear. Good afternoon, Mr. Sarafanov. Russians are terrible gossips around here, aren't they? Sometimes I feel they choose rumors over rubles. If they were starving in Siberia. You know, go do... unload feta. I's in the back. How is Nikita? How is Nikita? Wonderful, wonderful. Always busy with his call work. Nikita, please remove your hand from my crotch. I love you. Okay. Let's talk like grown-ups. You're fourteen. Romeo was fifteen. Romeo was fifteen. So, my Juliet was born four hundred years later in Ventura and not Verona. And... my Juliet teaches English at Fairfax Elementary School and lives in a rent-controlled apartment. My Juliet is not the spring but the early autumn which is the fairest season of them all. What do you want? I want you to promise me that when we make love, you'll keep your glasses on. I want you to read my body like I's Balzac. Out. Hi, Dad. Nikita? What do you think? A work for all passion. Thank you. A little extravagant perhaps. Reason is the last refuge of the unimaginative, Dad. Go ahead, Medusa! Drown the last flames of my dying heart! Yeah, well it's me or the fire department. Damn it. I can't hear myself. What? Screw? Wha's that? Some day yo'll realize that I love you as no one else ever will. For the moment you can rest easy, knowing that you got what you wanted. I hate you. Farewell, Nikita. Farewell. Where do you think you're going? Eat me. You can't leave. 'M the one tha's leaving. Who's gonna stay and look after Dad? You don't give a shit about him, why should I? What's going on here? Shut up. Precious wunderkind is running away Is it true? What about your school? And your piano lessons? I hate the piano! Why can't we all admit that we're mediocrities. It's genetic! Don't ever say that again. Your grandpa Notori was a great tenor. Oh, yeah. They have statue of him in downtown Kirov. Perfect. We can put up a statue of Nikita's erection on Fairfax Fairfax in honor of his monumental obsession with that cradle-robber next door. Are you on the rag or the pilot next door just missed the landing strip again? What'd you say? Why do you think I listen to my music so loud? These walls are like paper. Major. Colonel. Private. Oh, don't be so quick on the trigger, Lieutenant. Be a General about it. [MUMBLES IN RUSSIAN] Ha! Hwa! You want a piece of me? [Door closes] [Groans] I hate this place so much! [Police Radio Chatter] [Car Beeping] [Music] Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Uh, hello. Hello. Hi, um, can you buzz us in? W're... W're with, uh, Magic Carpet Cleaners. We're... W're gonna clean your carpet for free. [Knocking] [Door Opens] Susan? May I come in? [Police Sirens] Skip. Can I use your restroom? We've kind of been hoofing it for the last hour. Just go. [Helicopter Passes By] Do you mind? Thanks. [Music] Hey is that Habitual Offenders? Great band. I saw them in Baltimore before they got their record deal. [Sighs] [Sighs] [Sighs] Oh, yes, thank you. Thank you. [Chuckles] The tundra winds blow and he has too much. But at his age, life are full of dreams and love serenades. Uh, do you understand, you are professor literature? I teach third grade. And I would't call waking up with Nikita's hands between my legs a love serenade. And I's more like Class Three sexual assault. Who are you guys? Who are, who are we? Or, who are we? You know, cause that's more of a metaphysical question. Now I's probably something... you should be asking yourself, not a couple of strangers. We're looking for, um, a Mister S..., uh... Sarafanov? Sarafanov. Yes. Is he home? No. He'll be right back though. How do you know him? Well, that is a difficult question to answer for... Your dad and I, we, uh, we go back. You see, the thing is, is... Nikita. Nikita. That's a great name. Parlez-vous français? It's Russian. Nikita. And the sad thing is, is that I... I haven't even met your old man. But I thought you said you go way back. We do. We do. Max and I, we, Shit, I might as well just say it. Yeah. Yeah, you should probably just go ahead and say it. Max Sarafanov Happens to be... My father... I don't think he even knows I was born. So Nikita, that means you and I are... How bout you give your big brother a hug, huh? This is a beautiful moment. For both of you. Yeah. Yeah, go to him. Come on. I have to tell you something. I don't really like talking dirty during sex. You don't? I just fake it to make you happy. You're really good at it. At times I... think I'm just using you to get me out of this dump. So use me. Tha's the foundation of a good marriage. You fake it... and I take you with me when I go to Houston. You sure about that? What kind of question is that? I'm gonna marry you. I'm not pilot's wife material. Yes you are. No, I'm not. I... I have a tattoo I's not like yo're potato and 'm po-tah-to. You're a cheeseburger and I'm borscht. I'm taking you with me because I don't have a choice. I don't, huh? I love borscht. Do I have to climb out the window again? [Cork Pops] Thank you. Welcome! - Cheers. - Cheers. So Nikita. Where's your, um, your mom, like, Mrs. Sarafanov? No, no, no. There isn't a Mrs. Sarafanov. I know a single parent when I see one. It's true. When I was six, my mom, uh, test drove this Trans Am with this guy looked like Robert Redford. Uh, we never saw her again. Wow. Bummer. Anyway. Uh, Pringles? I always love a Pringle. Thank you. [Knocking] It's my dad Your dad! Our Dad! Hey. Hey. I have something important to tell you. Listen. I was just as young and mad as you once. Just exactly. You can say that again. You can't help it.

Your elder son. To my Russian bear. This is a no-brainer, I'm telling you. No way. What do you mean no way? No way. Why in the hell would we go anyplace else? Nobod's gonna look for us here. Look, how is, how the hell am I gonna convince a total fucking stranger that he's my father? Wait, wait. Your real father is a total fucking stranger. He might as well be this guy. Come on. I's worth a try. [Door opens] [Door closes] Good evening. Max Sarafanov. Skip Retcho. Really good to meet you, sir. Bo. I's, uh, short for, for Beauregard. So? How can I help you, Beauregard? Sir, we, we, apologize for just showing up here like this out of the blue. But, uh, , coming to meet his biological father was a very big decision for my friend. Well, unfortunately, I'm afraid, uh, this is some sort of misunderstanding. Sir, he's not asking for much. Just a little bit of your time? I hate to disappoint you. I really hope you find your father sometime soon. But, yo've got the wrong man. 'Ve been waiting for this moment since the day I learned to talk. And I's okay. Dad. I, I have no expectations and no regrets. But I never had another son. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. Hundred percent sure. When's your birthday? August fourteenth 1980. What's going on?

No. H's got Dad's eyes. Exactly. No, he does't. Our father has beautiful eyes. Lolita, there is no reason to be rude. Beauregard has the nice blue eyes.

Leave It was nice to meet you, Dad. What's her name? Your mother? Janice. Janice Who? Hanson. I'm sorry. I don't know anyone by that name. Really? Cellist from Cincinnati? You don't remember her?

No, just me. You know? The last time I saw her. She was standing at a bus stop waving her goodbye all by herself. She was't quite by herself, as you can see. You poor boy. You must have hated me. To sons having their fathers. I'm so glad you found me. W're getting the hell out of here first thing in the morning. What? Are you- Are you nuts? After all of that? After... I've been... waiting for this moment ever since I learned how to talk. That was beautiful. Yeah, but I can't hustle somebody who believes everything I say. Okay... [Acoustic Guitar Musi} Oh, shit. I for... I forgot my monologue. Be right back. Shit. What's wrong with you? Going some place? What'd you take? Nothing. I had a bad feeling about you from the beginning. Wha's going on in here? Your newly found son was just about to be lost again. I did't wanna make it a big deal. I thought I'd be easier on everyone. But... we were just getting to know each other. I'm sorry. We got midterms. I see. Will I ever see you again? Sure. Do you think, uh, I could call you? You know, I think I's... best if I call you. Oh, I understand. Well... My door is always open.

Are you sure we're all here? She's saying I have a reputation as a ladies man. Well, you earned, you Russian Bear. Says his cub. Nikit's dedicated his life to hooking up with sex as a second language professor next door. I can see where Nikit's coming from. Thank you! I pictured with someone with a little more class. Shut up. How about a nice Russian girl? Okay. I'm sure they'll love him with his pedigree. Do you know that you come from a long line of starving tenors, poets and woodwinds? See what I'm dealing with? A cynic. No sense of family pride. No identity. Well, I'm proud to be a woodwind. And you know what? I would love to go to the symphony and hear Dad play. Why don't you hear him play another day when you come back and visit? No, no. It's a great idea. He should come and, uh... hear his father play. You should come with me. Absolutely.

I'm happy for you, Max. I's good to see that some of us are doing something worthwhile with their lives. Thank you, my friend. Thank you. Listen, Esa... I have a bit of favor to ask you. My children have asked to come to the concert tomorrow. And I, well, I still haven't told them. You can't be serious. I know... All this time? Would you please let me replace you tomorrow? Max... You could get me fired. Look Esa. I bought this in a fine antique store in Gorkiy. It's Chervonaya silver. Beautiful see? They'll pay you... at least seven hundred... at pawn shop. But it's worth more. Please Esa... Just this one time. I'm sorry Max, I don't know what to say! Esa... My Children have to see me play. They cannot doubt that they have it in their blood to do great things with their lives. Tell your children you were let go. A bit of truth... is always better than a sweet lie. Good luck. Filling up on your Russian heritage? Hmm. This is great. You know what the great thing is? You're actually exercising. Laughing I am? Yup. It's the famous Russian-Piroski workout. You're working your abs out from the inside. You know, it's great cardio too? I can actually feel my arteries doing some heavy lifting. The average life expectancy in the old country is about fifty-seven. So, if yo're really serious about being Russian, you gotta learn how to live in the moment. Call me Boris.

Now I why. Thanks a lot, Janice. Shit! I told him they were gonna repo it. The've been leaving messages for months. They repossessed his car?

To give Max his car. Did you just trade my ticket to Tijuana to buy back this piece of shit for your pseudo Dad? I's not a piece of shit. I's a contemporary classic. Don't talk to me. I could go either way right now. I have a toast! A famous Russian Belarusian writer once said, I's a job of a woman to get married as soon as possible, And I's a man to get unmarried for as long as he can. Amen.
