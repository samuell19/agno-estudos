(MultiCom Jingle) (waves crashing) (eerie music) (cars driving) (phone vibrating) - [Brandon] Hey what's up man? - It's over with Dana. - [Brandon] Really? You sure? - Pretty sure. I went through her search history and she basically was on this dude name Logan's Facebook page like 300 times. So I'm thinking it's a bad sign. (buzzing) - [Dana] That's it spy on me? You break into my computer? - [Brandon] So where are you gonna go? - I don't know. - [Brandon] Well I'm headed to my folks' place for the weekend but, maybe you can come with me if you want. - [Dana] You don't talk you little shit. - To your folks? - Yeah. Get out of town, clear your head. - [Dana] Did you hack into my phone? - I don't wanna impose or anything. - No, you wouldn't be imposing. Honestly it's a long drive and I could use the company. It'll be fun. You know? You can get to see where I grew up. (laughing) Getting a home-cooked meal, come on, what do you say? (glass breaking) - [Dana] If you're gonna give me nothing I'd rather have the space. (door slamming) (eerie music) (soft music) - You still drawing cartoons? - It's a graphic novel. - I didn't mean that as an insult. - Whatever, I'm pretty much in this all to myself. - You gotta keep a positive attitude man. I heard this story on NPR where they took a set of lab rats, and half of them they wrote a sign that said dumb over'um, the other half said smart. The rats with the smart sign made it through the maze twice as fast. Just stay open to positive man. Don't limit yourself with negative labels. It's not helpful. Wanna get high? - Yes. (relaxing music) - Keep. (relaxing music) Keep. Oh. (laughing) Keep. Keep. Oh, this was Brandon's favorite. He used to dig holes in the yard and try to stuff him down there. In his little voice he'd say, go on Hoppy you're free now. And I'd say Brandon, Hoppy doesn't wanna be set free, he likes it here. If we put him in the washing machine one more time, he won't have any eyes left. (chuckling) - His ear's molding. - We can wash him. - Hoppy lives. (soft music) - Come on Liebowitz, you can do it. (chain dragging) (soft music) - All this change is making me hungry. Are you hungry Piper? - I'm straight. - Oh good. I wasn't sure. I like how you're upfront about these things. - I meant about the food. - Listen honey, I bought some strawberries from one of those Mexicans on the corner, they're big as plums. The berries not the Mexicans. Would you like me to get you some? - Sure, why not? (soft music) - I'm thinking about asking Yuan to marry me. No I'm gonna ask Yuan to marry me. - Wow, that's amazing. - I'm gonna ask my parents for my grandmother's ring. (inhaling) (exhaling) - Rats. Damn. (laughing) Wow. - I feel really good about it. - And you should. Wow. You are like the most adult person I know. (laughing) - You know adults. (laughing) - I do. - It's good to have help for once. - Yeah. Yeah sure. - I have a whole new vision for this house. New rugs. New couch. New people. I have to tell you Piper, every morning I wake up and I say Mary, today is a new day. You have to believe there is a god above who is shedding his light where need be. But then come the emails, and the doctor's appointments, and that damn dog shitting everywhere again. And the roof. Don't get me started with that. And before you know it it's four pm and you just wanna say screw it and make yourself a cocktail. - Well, we will have this place spic and span in no time. - I should let you go. You're tired. You must have homework. - Honestly I don't mind. I need to the money. - I have this special ability to know what people are thinking. I'm emotionally absorbent, like a sponge. It's a blessing and a cursing. You feel something and it's like wow, I feel it too. - I can go finish in the office? - Great idea. You do that. And try this on. I think it's your size. - You're too kind. Seriously. - Oh. (eerie music) - [Adam] This is it? - [Brandon] Yeah. Home sweet home. Who's car is that? - You're asking me? - [Man] Live not a low life. Remember and forget not. - Where should I put my stuff? - In the corner by the shoes. - Mm hm. So, I take off my shoes? Or I'll just keep'um on. - Oh fuck. Oh fuh ah ah yeah. (urine flowing) Oh. Ah. (urine flowing) - [Adam] What's up with the roof? - I thought they fixed that. - This is a lot of stuff. - Yonk. Hoppy. Yes. Strawberries? - Dana used to love strawberries. Last year I got her chocolate-covered strawberries for her birthday, then we had sex. - Right. Okay, so here's the deal. We say hello. Drive into town, get some food. Then tonight, I get the ring, we're outta here by Sunday. - Sounds like a plan. - You don't understand. They're gonna want us to stay as long as possible. Don't let them suck you in. - Got it, no sucking. - The ring's beautiful man. It was my grandmother's from Berlin. - I love Berlin. So much history. (dog barking) - Liebowitz. - Who's Liebowitz? - She's out dog. She's awesome. She's like awesome all the time. We have a real connection. Liebowitz! Liebowitz! Liebowitz! Liebowitz! - [Mary] Brandon! Brandon! Brandon! - [Brandon] Hey Mom. - You said tomorrow. - Yeah, I got the day off so I'm here early. - Oh my son, I'm not prepared. My son is home! - Oh okay, take it easy. - You have bags under your eyes. - Yeah, I've been working late. - Are you taking those vitamins I gave you for your hair? - What's all this stuff doing out? - Oh, I'm organizing. You have to take everything out so you know what you've got. I was planning to surprise you. Have you walk in and go whoa, look what she's done to the house. That was my goal. But I missed my goal. (laughing) - Hmm. Hey Mom, this is Adam. - Pleased to meet you. - Oh, I'm not wearing any makeup. - That's cool, neither am I. - Um, please don't mind the mess. You have to imagine what it will look like with a new coat of yellow paint. A new sofa, some paintings on the wall. And, well you just have to use your imagination. - I can see it. (coughing) - Uh oh, is he okay? - [Brandon] Yeah, he's fine. - [Adam] I'm fine. - Your eyes are bloodshot. - It's pollen. - Are you in pain? Do you need a painkiller? - Adam just got out of this really just awful abusive relationship. - [Adam] Dude. - [Mary] I'll definitely get you a painkiller. - Mom, what are you doing with painkillers? - Oh, I don't have any painkillers. Your father has'um from the surgery. - Oh, speaking of, where is he? - Relationships can be so confusing. You're just two people who agree to these rules, and then someone comes along and it erases all the lines. And you're like, but Dicky there was a rule. You can't take the dog. He's not your dog he's our dog. Don't yell at me because I don't walk the dog. - Totally. - Oh god, I'm sorry! Mom. There's a girl in Dad's office. - That's Piper. - She's not wearing any clothes. - I found her on Craigslist. - If I had known we were having company I would've worn underwear. - It's my son. My son is here. - Hi, it's nice to meet you. - I'm almost done with the files in the office. Mind if we finish up tomorrow? - Absolutely, I have my son with me. I'll see you tomorrow Pipe. - Thanks again for the dress. (chuckling) (sighing) - She seems nice. - How did you know Brandon? - We met freshman year at Oberlin Mom. - It's actually kind of a funny story. See I get these really bad migraines. - That's not funny. - Ma, where's Dad? - I know about migraines. Travis used to get them all the time. - Okay, let's, not that. - And I used to hold his temple and put a warm towel over his eyes. - [Brandon] Mom where is Dad? - He went out in the car, okay? He took the car. - Did the doctor tell'um he's not supposed to drive? - Do you think he listens to a doctor? - He just had his surgery. - You think I didn't tell him that? I said Dicky don't take the car. He said, I don't care what the doctor says. I haven't been in an accident since '97. And I said, then how many fingers am I holding up. And he says, one! - Okay, where is he? - Do you really wanna have this conversation in front of your guest? - Mom, what's going on? Where's Dad? And what are you doing to this house? - I'm giving it love! The house needed some love! Someone has to give it. It wasn't going to be him. It wasn't going to be you. It wasn't going to be Liebowitz. Liebowitz pees on the rug. I don't wanna live in a house with piss on the rug. Why am I defending myself to you Brandon? Stop attacking me. - I'm not attacking you. - Both of you are always attacking me. I'm just trying to give the house some care and love. (creaking) - So which room am I staying in? - You'll stay in my room. - That's the art room. - Fine, he'll stay in the guestroom. - Where will you stay Brandon? - I'll stay down here. - He should stay in the bud room. (creaking) - Guestroom is fine. - I'll put on fresh sheets. - But-- - Brandon don't worry about your father. - How could you let him drive when he can't see? - He's not worth worrying about! This is a wonderful town, relax. Have a drink. I know I will. Then you can go mingle with the young folk. Do what you boys like to do. If you want I can come. But only if you want. If not, I'll work on my dinnerware. I make dinnerware in a kiln. I sell it at a crafts fair. Did Brandon tell you about me? Just Brandon talk about me? What do you do again? - Ah, I'm an illustrator. - An artist. The creative path is never easy. It's enough to drive a person insane. Look at what happened to Camille Claudel. I'm actually writing a book about it. I just haven't put it on paper yet. But it's all in my head. He has nice hair, doesn't he Brandon? - Yeah. - Very shiny. Such nice hair. - Oh my god, I just realized I'm not wearing my hair. Don't look. I didn't finish getting dressed. Oh dear. Come back. Go outside. Take a walk then come back. I like your shirt. That's the color I'm gonna paint the living room. (door closing) - So, your mom? - [Man] The world is in need. (glass clanking) (glass clanking) See the light. (grunting) - What's the bud room? - The basement. - Why is it called the bud room? (sighing) - I can't. I really just can't get into that right now. - [Man] Live not a low life. Remember and forget not. (humming) Follow not raw ideas. Sink not into the world. (humming) - Alright, I should probably go someplace else. - No, no, no. 'Cause if you leave now, she's gonna think it's because of her alright? - I hate to say but it kind of is. Yes. - [Mary] Hello boys. - Christ. - Please forgive my little outburst. I went upstairs and meditated with my Buddha statue. And now I'm perfectly domicile. - Docile. - I take it back, you should probably leave as soon as possible. - It's so nice to have boys in the house. You bring in the energy. You bring in the life. I feel revitalized just looking at you. - Yeah, I need a taxi. - Who are you talking to Brandon? - I'm calling a taxi Mom. - Why would you do that? - Adam has to leave. - Is this because of my house? - No, he's not feeling so well. - Ah, my allergies. - Oh no, I scared your friend. - No Mom, you're fine. - No, I'm scary. I scared your friend. I look hideous. I'm a hideous woman aren't I? - No you're beautiful Mom. - No I'm ugly. This is why he's going. I'm ugly and I'm hideous. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Fine, call a taxi, I won't look at you. You don't have to look at me. I'll go back to my room. I'll shut the door. I'll turn off the lights. I'll go under the sheets. And I'll close my eyes so you don't have to see me. I'll hold my breath so you don't have to hear me breathing. I was just trying to organize. I was cleaning. I was (mumbling) your guest with clean sheets. - [Brandon] Mom, it's okay. Please, you're not ugly. - Don't lie to me Brandon. - Mom please. - I'm an ugly monster. The neighbors are right! - Mom please. I'm trying to help you. But you have to tell me what happened to Dad? - I don't know what's going on. (crying) I've been left in the dark. (crying) - I can see what you were saying about the house. And what it will look like when you paint the walls yellow. I can see it. And my guess is that you you're probably an incredible cook. Right? - You're just saying that. How can you say that? - No, no, no, no. I like this. Like, I really like older homes. And I like the energy. I can see the eclectic taste here. It's a little funky but I like the energy. - Oh please call me Mary. - Mary. (chuckling) - [Brandon] How long has he been gone for? - Ah, three days to four, I don't remember. - Okay, we're good. We have to drive around and see if we can find him. - Wait. Don't leave me. - Okay. It's okay, it's okay, I'm not going anywhere. (heavy breathing) Adam, could you do me a huge favor? - [Man] A man who wisely controls his senses as a good driver. - [Adam] Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign! That was a stop sign. (soft music) (buzzing) - You're such a nice young man. Being so kind to an old day like me. - I just thought it might be nice. - But taking me out to dinner. - Yeah this is dinner. - I know. What did you think it was? - Well nothing. - People need to eat. (phone vibrating) - No (mumbling) now baby. - I wonder if Brandon found Dicky. I'm going to call him. I've got a smart phone. (chuckling) (soft happy music) (chuckling) Stupid smart phone. It's not working. (soft music) - Can I see it? (sighing) Hmm. There. - How did you do that? - I just turned it on. - Thank you. I'm going to text him. Brandon. Call me. No not meat. Oh shoot, I sent it. Now it says Montana. - Hm, that's the corrected text. - Oh shoot I sent it again. How do I get it to unsend? Oh great, I just told Brandon to call Montana. Oh now I sent it to my gynecologist. - Here let me just. (phone vibrating) - Jesus. (spoon rattling) (soft music) - Dicky hates this place. He can't see so I have to read him the items off the menu. - How exactly did your husband hurt his eyes? - Well, Dicky likes to get his sun. So he was outside suntanning in his sun chair when he doses off with his eyes open. A few moments later he wakes up screaming. I thought that was it. Goodbye Dicky's eyes. But the doctors are optimistic that he'll be able to see again. You have beautiful eyes. Does anyone ever tell you that? - Not really. - There so full of color and heartbreak. - I don't know about that. - Yes. - I'm an artist, I can see these things. That's the hard thing about life. You have to keep your heart open no matter how many times people step all over it. (cars passing) (sad music) - Welcome to, hi. - What are you doing here? - I work here. - You do? - I have two jobs. - Good for you. You must need money. - So can I start you off with something to drink? - Let's see. I feel weird asking the help to get us drinks. - You know I can hear you. - What do you wanna drink? - Let's see, what's fun? I know. How 'bout the blue raspberry slush with Red Bull? - She'll have the blue raspberry slush with Red Bull. - Sugar-free Red Bull. - Sugar-free Red Bull. - Don't skimp on the Red Bull. - You want the hula, it's double the size? - That sounds like too much. - You do get to keep the glass. - Sold. - And for you son? - Oh no, no. - He's not. - I'm Adam, not Brandon. - Right, I mixed you two up there. - Really? - No. - Adam, would you like a hula with Red Bull? - Um, water's fine. - Alright, I'll be right back. (soft music) - You keep looking at her. - I do? - She's your type isn't she? - Oh no. Mm mm, not really. - Yes she is, I can tell. You like a girl who's gonna rough you up a little. - What? - It's so good to see people come together. Beautiful to see that magical connection for the very first time. I remember that. I actually happen to know her on a personal level. So if you want me to say something. - Please don't say anything. - I'm really good at this. Saying things is sort of my specialty. - I don't want you to. - But I want to. - I don't want you to. - You're so bashful. Look at you blushing. Oh. (laughing) This is fun. I needed to have some fun. - Well at lease you're having fun. - It's so wonderful you're friends with Brandon. He used to be so close with his brother. - Brother? - [Mary] Travis. - I didn't know he had a brother. - He's no longer with us. (soft music) - I had no idea. - Okay, here is your water. And your blue raspberry slush with sugar-free Red Bull. - Thanks. - Okay. - Let's share the fried zucchini. Guess we're sharing the fried zucchini. - Anything else? - Piper this is Adam. - We've already met. - Adam is an illustrator. The next Vincent van Gogh. - Well hopefully not. - Such a nice boy. Beautiful eyes, don't you think? - Stop it. - Why? - You're young, she's young. Go on, talk. Tell her what you want. (soft music) - I want a cheeseburger, medium. - Okay and for you? - I'll have your hair. She has nice hair. I was making a joke. I'm not allowed to make a joke? She has nice hair. - Sure. - Go ahead, tell her. (soft music) - Um, you have nice hair. - He thinks you have nice hair. - Okay, you don't have to repeat me after I say it. - There's nothing wrong with complimenting a woman on her hair. It's not like she's gonna have it forever. - Enough! (soft music) - I'll have the shrimp Key West. - I will be right back with that. (soft music) - Stop embarrassing me. - I'm embarrassing you? - Saw a love connection. - Okay, thank you, but I like just got out of a relationship this morning, so I don't need you for that. (banging) (emotional music) (phone vibrating) (emotional music) (sighing) - I should check on Brandon, see if he's found Dicky. - That's a good idea. (phone vibrating) (emotional music) (phone vibrating) (emotional music) - Want some slushy? - No thanks. - You sure? It's delicious. (slurping) (slurping) - Happy now? - I said some. If you're that thirsty get your own damn slushy. - I'm just trying to get through this dinner okay? (soft music) I'm sorry that was rude. - No, I understand. I know what I'm like. People tell me. Dicky tells me. - Um, I'm really sorry about Travis. - They used to throw rocks at him when we would walk to school. Brandon gave him his hockey helmet to protect him from the rocks. And he wore it everyday. When Brandon went to college, Travis was devastated. He spent two years held up in the bud room until he finally got a job at a gas station. Dicky would go ballistic. How could his son work at a gas station? He would come in for gas and Travis would whack him with a squeegee. And they would go at each other all night long. And with Brandon not there to come to Travis' defense the only thing that would comfort him were back scratches. He was 25 and that's what I had to do. And no it wasn't sexual. I was his mother. It was only that once. On Christmas day at the gas station, he killed a squirrel and set it on fire along with a tire. He blackened everything to a crisp. Some of the gas station caught fire as a result. There was a lawsuit. I think Dicky blamed himself in someway. To this day, he still goes back to that gas station returning to the scene. - Here are your zucchini fritters. - Uh oh. What's wrong? - Ah, migraine. - Are you okay bud? - I think we need to go. - Oh damn, this was fun. - I'll pay for the zucchini. - Is there anything I can do? - Put them in the bag. Don't worry, momma's taking care of you. - I need to go right now. - Hang tight. We're almost there. (screaming) - Light. - Light, uh. So light's no good for a migraine. I'll turn off the light. (screaming) Oh, off the light. Wait that's the hallway. That's the patio. (groaning) We need to get you an eye bath. (groaning) Look, here. This is an eye mask. - [Adam] Fiorinal. A Fiorinal. - [Mary] Tylenol. - [Adam] Fiorinal, in the bag. Blue and red. (moaning) (grunting) - Let's see. (grunting) - Oh, how many do you want? Two. Okay. (moaning) You need some water? I'll get you some water. (eerie music) Here we go. And this. (eerie music) (moaning) Okay. You got your pills. What else? I know. I'll light a candle. (eerie music) (moaning) (eerie music) Isn't that calming? It feels good on your eyes. Doesn't it? (mumbling) If you need something just tap me on the shoulder. Or, nod your head. - [Adam] Uh huh. - Or shake your foot. Oh, uh. - [Adam] My love war. - What? I didn't follow. - [Adam] My love war. - Who takes care of you when this happens? Does anybody take care of you? - My. No. Dark. (moaning) - You're just like Travis. (moaning) Travis. I know what to do with you. Come on. We're going to the bud room. - No. - Yes, it's very dark. You'll love it. It's absolutely perfect down there. - [Adam] No. No I don't wanna go there. - [Mary] There's a futon. You'll sleep better. - [Adam] No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - [Mary] Yes. It's very dark. - No, no, no, no. This really doesn't seem like a good I... (suspenseful music) (mumbling) (suspenseful music) (fire crackling) (suspenseful music) - You're such a good boy. (suspenseful music) (alarm beeping) (suspenseful music) Uh oh. (suspenseful music) (alarm beeping) (suspenseful music) - Shit, Mom! Mom! - Oh, shoot! The candle. - Ma, get some water! (grunting) Those are dry flowers! What the fuck! - [Mary] Come on! Oh, come on now! Down. Down! Stop it! (pan clanking) - Damn it. Fuck. (water flowing) - [Mary] We're having friend, stop it! (alarm beeping) Stop it! - Get out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! Out of the way! (grunting) (water splashing and sizzling) (heavy breathing) (jacket flapping) (coughing) Where's Adam? - He's in the bud room, he had a migraine. - Oh god, I told you not to put him down there! - Well it's the darkest room! - (mumbling) god! - I try to do everything right. Shut up smoke detector! (banging) (suspenseful music) (heavy breathing) - Well, at least the smoke's going through the fucking hole in the roof. - Brandon, I cannot take anymore of this condescending tone of yours. - I don't care. I feel like I've been in crisis mode since I got here. - So, I started a fire. I also helped you put it out. Give me some credit. - Give me the pills. - What pills? - I'm serious. - Where's the pot? - What pot? - Exactly. - [Brandon] Why is there still a hole in the roof? - I call the roofers, your father sends them home. Everything go torn to pieces in the art room. He says why do you need a room when you don't paint? I say I'm trying to enhance my life. I want to go to Spain. Go to the Guggenheim. (mumbling) always on the computer. I don't know, maybe I should get another hobby. Go on a cruise, yoga. I hear there are classes with hot rocks where everyone sweats and you come out a new person. That's what I want Brandon. I want to come out a new person. - Are you getting a divorce? - Who knows? First you have to find someone before you can divorce'um. (grunting) - What the fuck. (grunting) (yelling) (exhaling) (cap popping) - Fuck it I'm getting high. - It's hard for me to watch you do that. - I don't care. It calms me down. - Why didn't you tell your friend you had a brother? - I was going to. But when you hijacked my day. - [Mary] You can be so secretive. I haven't met your girlfriend. - [Brandon] And you will. (mumbling) - [Mary] I don't think you've even told me her name. - It's, ah, Mindy. - Mindy? Is she Jewish? - No, is that a problem? - As long as she makes you happy that's all that matters to me. (door banging) - [Brandon] Dad? - Brandon. - Where have you been? - I took Liebowitz for a walk. - Mom says you've been gone for four days. - It was a long walk. - So where is he? - He got off the leash, the stupid animal. - And you didn't try to look for him? - I tried to find him, but my eyes. - Mom says you've been driving. - I drove him somewhere to take him for a walk and then I walked home. - Dicky? - Yeah, what? - So where's the car? - Who can say? - Dicky? - Yeah, what? - We've been worrying about you. - Liebowitz needed some space. - Liebowitz needed some space? (grunting) - [Mary] Sleep time. It'll be better. - Dogs are very loyal to their masters, but every once and a while they have thoughts of their own. Like they can't stand the sight of bullshit anymore. - Are you leaving her? - Who said that? - Just answer the question. - You don't walk back into my life after a year into this house, and tell me what to do. - Richard. - Thought Brandon was coming tomorrow? - Well he surprised us both. - I come home, you're missing. She's tearing up the whole house. Humiliating me in front of my friend. And you lost my dog. I need you to at least act normal. Or I am leaving. And I am not coming back. (screaming) - Travis. (screaming) (eerie music) (snoring) (eerie music) (grunting) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) - [Brandon] Hello? - I've tried you three times. Why aren't you answering your phone? - I just woke up. - How's it going? - Good. You know, just hanging with the folks. - How's the weather up there? - Nice. The sun's out. (cat growling) - Stop is Sebastian. I don't know what to do. Sebastian's freaking out. - Well, because he knows you're cutting off his manhood. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. Just trying to be funny. - Ha ha. You failed. - Well, wouldn't be the first time. - I feel like you're hiding something from me. - No. I'm not hiding anything from you. - See look, I'm just trying to take care of our cat okay? On my own, without you, because you had to go to your folks for some reason, which makes me feel like you're ashamed of bringing me or something. - You know what, that could literally not be more of the opposite of what's happening. - If you say so. Why wasn't I invited? - You know what, I have a pretty good reason for that, which you will find out about shortly. - Mm hm. Did you tell Adam about Travis yet? - No, I'm waiting for a good time. - You cannot be serious. - You know what, he just got up so I'm gonna have to call you back. - Seriously, you're gonna have to learn how to deal with adversity. (clicking) Hello? (sighing) - [Brandon] I heard you had a migraine. - Yeah. It was pretty bad. You know? Your mom gave me these sweats so. - Yeah. (chuckling) I was wondering where those came from. - Last night sounded like you were in a situation. - Oh, yeah. I was. But it's better now. - Is it? - Yeah, my dad came back so. - Oh he's back? - Yup. - That's good, where was he? - Apparently he lost our dog and his car. And then there's three days unaccounted for. (laughing) But now he's back. - Well at least he's safe. - Um, I am so sorry I dragged you into this. - Yeah, about that it's-- - As soon as I get this right, we are out of here. - No, I mean, it's understandable that your mom is having a hard time with everything that you guys have been, you know, going through. - She told you about Travis? - Why didn't you tell me? - Am I interrupting? - No, no, come on in. (grunting) - Would you mind giving me a hand? There's a few more out in the car. - Oh yeah. No, no, I got it. - So how's the head? - Better, thanks for asking. (leaves rattling) (emotional music) - Well, yeah that was pretty embarrassing. I have never been dragged out of a restaurant by a grown woman before. - My manager felt bad. Said to give you a coupon for a free shake. Redeemable anytime after five. - Awesome. So, um, you're in a band? - Why you play? - No. Well, the oboe. When I was seven they said choose an instrument so I chose the oboe. But I couldn't handle the pressure. I was a bad oboe player. So that was my nickname, Oboe. Am I still talking right now? I should have to stop. I don't know, maybe that's why I'm attracted to musicians. - Is that right? - Oh, I didn't. I didn't um. I'm not saying that I'm attracted to you in particular. It's just more of. - Just attracted to people like me. In general. - Mm, peanut butter cups. Mm mm. Mm, that is really old. Like super old. - Are you surprised? - You've seen me at my worst. Lot of lows here. - It's quite a look. - [Brandon] Hey, how much food did you get? - Big dinner tonight. - What's the occasion? - I'm looking at it. - Ah, thanks for the coupon. - Don't mention it. - Dude. - What? - You're trying to hit on Craigslist girl? - Stop it. (mumbling) No. - Really? Hmm. - 'Cause it kind of looks like you're trying to hit that. - I'm not trying to hit Craigslist girl. - I don't blame you. I mean, her body is smoking. - No smoking in the house. - No one's smoking Dad. - This is your dad. - Have you seen my tablet? - Why would I have seen your tablet? - Maybe you took it. - I didn't take your tablet. - Maybe your friend took it. - My friend didn't take your tablet. - Yeah, I didn't take your tablet. - How do you know he didn't take it? - Oh shit. Yuan's blowing me up. I gotta take this. - He's always on the phone. - It's his girlfriend. - Hmm. I knew that. - I think they're fighting. - He doesn't share that kind of thing with me. - I don't think it's personal. - Well I'm his father. Everything's personal. - Hey, Gotta pro-pone-it-ose-dis-cose. (laughing) Mm. There she is. - Tablet. (thundering) - What brings you to town? - Just taking a break from New York. - A break huh? - Yeah, you know. - No I don't, that's why I'm asking you. - I was living with my girlfriend and we broke up, so now I'm not. And I'm working on a graphic novel. - So you're in transition. - Yeah. - Isn't that life? A series of transitions. - I hope not. - Don't let a breakup get you down. Through all adversary or obstacles, there is a seed of greater benefit. That's Napoleon. A personal hero of mine. - You must have a great capacity to see the best in people. (thundering) - I do. I came up with a story about that. There's this father. He's a standup guy. He's a mechanical engineer. People like him. He has two sons. He gives everything to the youngest son and he squanders it. Everybody thought he's never coming back, but he did return. And the father was just so happy to see him again. Oh my, you could see the happiness in his eyes. He loved his son so much he forgot the squandering. And the older said, are you gonna forgive him for what he did? And the father was just so happy that he was home and he loved him so much, he said I have two sons and I love'um both. The end. (thundering) - Isn't that the story of the Prodigal Son? - I made it up. - I think it's the story of the Prodigal Son. - No it's my story I made it up. I thought you'd appreciate it. - No I do. But I'm pretty sure you just took the story of the Prodigal Son and you put yourself in it. - I made it up! It's my story. Mine. Ah fuck it, maybe you're right. It's a lot like the Prodigal Son. (laughing) - For the love of god, why are you yelling? - I'm having a conversation with Brandon's friend. - Oh, goodness, Adam you're alive. You should've seen him last night. Cooing like a baby animal lost in the wood. No milk. No tite to suck. - I get migraines, but I'm okay now. - (mumbling) fucking shit. - [Mary] Brandon what's wrong? - Nothing. Everything's great. - He's fighting with his girlfriend. - What? Who told you that? - Everything okay with Yuan? - Yuan? Who's Yuan? - Your girlfriend's name is Yuan? - I thought it was Mindy. - Well Yuan is her Chinese name. - Your girlfriend is Asian? - She's Chinese American. - Why would you say her name was Mindy if it's Yuan? - Trust me, you don't wanna fight with an Asian. - We're not fighting. - [Dicky] Good, because you won't win. - She's just, she has to neuter a cat. - Herself? - No, she took it to the vet. - Brandon, why are you fighting over a cat? - We're not fighting. - You know in the Chinese culture, a cat represents pussies. - [Mary] Dicky! - It's a fact. (grunting) - Can you please stop disrespecting Asians? - Are you kidding? I love Asians. They have a great work ethic. They don't even have to cook their fish. - Look what you're doing to him. What is it Brandon? (grunting) You look like you're going to explode. - I'm fine. I just wanna have a nice dinner tonight is all. - I hate how everybody holds everything in. If you have something to say then say it. - Why'd you throw away Hoppy? - I would never, never throw away your rabbit Brandon. - Well you should, because the dog has been humping it so much (chuckling) that it's like a freaking cum rag. - Whatever is going on, we'll all talk about it at dinner like a family. Because that's what families do. And we're going to celebrate your friend. The poor thing. It's the least I can do after what he's been through. Come on. It's going to be better Brandon. It's going to be better. See? It's better. Can't you feel it? - Come on let's get you outta here. - Ah, I'm good. - Trust me, it's only gonna get worse from here. - How can I help Mary? - Dinner is going to be tasty. (soft music) (sighing) - Well that was delicious. - Yeah, thanks Mom. Wasn't that good Dad? - What? - Mom's brisket. - I have something in my shoe. - Thank you Dicky, I'm glad you liked it. (soft music) - Let me give you a hand. - Oh no, you just sit Travis. - It's Adam. - Oh, did I? - She always does this. - I do not. - Yes, you always are just mixing up names. You used to call me Dicky, the dog Brandon, and Dad Liebowitz. (laughing) - Liebowitz, that's the dog right? Whatever happened to him? - Brisket was very good. Thank you. - [Brandon] By the way, Yuan says hello. - Well, I'll drink to that. - She's very much looking forward to meeting you both. - Well, you really like Yuan? - I do. We're very happy. - Well, not right now. - Richard. - I'm just stating a fact. They're not getting along. - Thank you for highlighting that. - I'll get the apple pie. - Mm, great. - Adam, would you like some pie? - You know what, I think I'm good. I feel like I've gained 100 pounds since I've been here. (chuckling) - Oh no, no, eat, eat. You have to. - You know, this is like a real family dinner. I've got my wife. I've got Brandon. I've got Craigslist. And you. You're like, you're like um. (knocking) - Brandon don't you have some news to share? - Yes Brandon, what is this news we've been waiting to hear about? (throat clearing) - Okay. (clanking) (exhaling) Mom, Dad, As you know um, Yuan and I have been dating for about a year now. And um, but in these last few months something has become very apparent to me. - She's a man? - No. - I saw it on 60 Minutes. She said she's a woman, but there's a penis. - Richard. - I don't judge. Love is love. - Brandon is trying to tell us something. - Yes, what I was trying to say before I was so rudely interrupted was that I've decided to ask Yuan to be my wife. (emotional music) - Wow, that's Brandon. (laughing) - Yeah, um, and with your permission of course, I'd like to, well I'd like to give her Grandma Roda's ring. - You mean the one she brought from Berlin in her anus? (items clanking) - [Piper] Sorry. - I was unaware of that part of the story. - That's why she didn't wear it anymore. - I don't understand. - Well next weekend, we are going wine tasting. And I've got a room at the Rhine Cliff. And a table at the Culinary Institute. And all I need is the ring. - Just so I'm clear, you're asking me to give Roda's ring to a girl I've never met? - No (laughing) Mom. I give her the ring Mom. (laughing) - But what if she sells it? - [Brandon] What? She's not gonna sell Roda's ring. - [Mary] How do you know? - [Brandon] Because, I mean, she has money. (laughing) - That's what this is all about. - No. What? Come on, no, that's not what this is. - If she has so much money why doesn't she buy her own damn ring? (laughing) - You realize that this is about you right? I mean, this is including you. - You want to include me by giving away my ring? - [Brandon] No by keeping it in our family. - [Mary] But it's going to someone else. - No to Yuan. My fiance. My potential future wife. - I get it. This family isn't good enough. You want to join another one. - My god. Dad aren't you gonna say anything? - The Yuan Dynasty was very common to the Chinese people. - Okay, fuck this. (grunting) - Dicky. - You're marrying a Yuan. You want the calm. You want the stability. - [Brandon] Oh my god! - Will you put on your pants? - [Dicky] This is my home. - [Mary] These are our guests. - [Dicky] I'm sure the guests would like to be comfortable in their house. This one doesn't even have a home. - Excuse me. - He's a homeless. - He is not a homeless. He just broke up with his girlfriend and he's looking for a new home. Do you get the distinction? And another thing, where is my dog? - Oh don't be melodramatic. - God. No one cares. No one cares. None of you care. - I care about his peeing. - [Adam] Hey. - Hey. - Where were you rushing off to? - I have some things to do why? - Can I join you? - Yeah I would but tonight's no good. - Totally. - Tomorrow? (sighing) - Tomorrow we're outta here. As soon as Brandon gets that ring. I guess I'll just go back inside. - Come with me. - Yeah? - Offer expires in three, two. - Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. One. (soft music) This'll do. (sighing) (soft music) So how long have you worked for Brandon's mom? - [Piper] About two months now. I'm trying to save money for school. And my mom is in a tough spot, so. - What's up with your mom? - She has breast cancer. - I'm sorry. That sucks. - She had me when she was 19. It's kind of too young to die. - Well that's big of you helping her out. - You're not cool with your parents? - My parents are, they're like this light switch that will never on no matter how many times you try to flip that switch. There's, there's just no light. - So at some point, why keep trying? - I don't know. Someone should really fix that hole in the roof. - Look, I know you mean well, but you do not want to mess with that. - Why not? - You really don't know. - Know what? - What happened to Travis. Apparently, his dad forced him to install solar panels. But he was like really overweight and he went out, he stepped on a rotting patch. - Wait is that how he-- - Well no. I mean, no. (chuckling) But after that he ODed on painkillers. (exhaling) - How old was he? - 25. - So he was like a full-sledged adult. - I, I wouldn't call him an adult. - Well he was old enough to be an adult. - Age doesn't make someone an adult. - Well what makes someone an adult? - Maybe when you finally learn who your parents are but you love them anyway. - Okay. Are you an adult? (laughing) - No. (laughing) - Okay. - Oh. You? - [Adam] Judging by your definition, I don't know if I am. - [Piper] We'll get there one day. - [Adam] Hopefully. (kissing) - God, I'm sorry. I just can't do this. - Beer breathe? - No. You're fine. You're just doing what everybody does. - Which is what? - You have an empty space that you need to fill. (emotional music) - Okay. So if you didn't bring me up here for this, what are we doing? (emotional music) - I can't go back into that house again. School is so damn expensive. And with my mom I... (sighing) (emotional music) I was going to sell it. But I don't think that I can actually go through with it. - Is that the wedding ring? (emotional music) - I found it in the left owl on the mantle. Could you put it back for me? (emotional music) - [Mary] I can't believe you feel more at home in an Asian family than you do in your own home. - Maybe it's that eastern influence Mom. - That's not funny. There was never an eastern influence here. We brought you up American. In an American home. In an American way. - I feel so patriotic when I'm with you guys. - After eating my brisket, and enjoying it the way you did, how could you possibly spend your life eating Asian food? - Do you know how uncomfortable you make me? Do you feel underappreciated? - [Mary] (mumbling) accusations. - [Brandon] I'm not making accusations at all. - You said I was drinking too much. - [Brandon] Mom you're drunk. - I am not. - [Brandon] Mom you're drunk. You're drunk, you're drunk. - I am not drunk. I have not had a lot to drink. I have had a reasonable amount. - That's a new bottle of vodka you cracked Mom. Don't you think you've had enough? - It's a new bottle that's it, it's a new bottle. - It's a new bottle for after dinner. - Well, I needed it after dinner. After the treatment I received. I didn't get any appreciation for my cooking. - Mom we said thank you. We loved the brisket. - We loved your brisket. - Are you asking for another thank you? - No I am not asking-- - Thank you for the brisket. - No. - Thank you for the brisket. - I have an idea. I think we should fix the roof. - Excuse me? - Just to keep the leaves out. And I mean, we could do it before we go back tomorrow. - Now this, this is a friend. - Stay out of this. - I'll tell you what we're gonna do. You and me, we're gonna go up on the roof tomorrow, and we're gonna fix it together. - Absolutely not. - No, we're leaving tomorrow. - Richard, you are not going on the roof. - I'll teach him how. - Not in your state. - Now that I finally got some real help around here. - I told you. Suck, suck, suck! - If he wants to help, let him help. - I wanna help. - Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I see what this is. You're trying to make me feel guilty for leaving. - I'm not trying to make you feel anything. - No, no, no it's fine, it's fine. I apologize for having a life. - Okay, this is enough excitement for me. Um, I just wanna fix the roof. That's all. We can talk about the details tomorrow. Goodnight. Oh and PS, I'm Asian. - I like that kid. That kid's good. That kids a pearl. (light clicking) (soft music) - Brandon, can I give you a hand? - I got it Mom. - How about some breakfast? - I'm working here. - Why are you so hard on me? - You know, you just you mean well but sometimes you just, you sure show it. - Why can't you just say you love me? I love you. That's it. It's simple. It's not complicated. It's not multilevel. - Well, it's hard for me. - [Mary] Why does it have to be? - Because, you love something and then it's just like you just squeeze the life out of it. - [Mary] You're blaming me for what happened. - [Brandon] (mumbling) time, I don't blame you. - [Mary] You think I coddled him. You think I loved him too much. - Mom, I, I can't talk about him with you alright? 'Cause it doesn't change anything. - We have to be able to talk about this. - Just give me the ring. Why can't you just give me Roda's ring? - Because he wanted it. - Who? - Your brother. - Mom, he's dead. - He didn't want you to have it. You got everything and everything fell apart after you left! - You know why I don't come home? It isn't because of Travis it's because of you. Because you take pills. And then you keep taking them. And you know what they make you crazy! (crying) (sighing) (crying) I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. - I am not crazy. I have emotions. But I'm not delusional. I'm a mother. I love my children. There is nothing wrong with that. Do you wanna know what crazy is? Crazy is not loving your mother. Crazy is taking everything and not giving anything back. - Just give me the ring. Okay? - You want Roda's ring? - Yeah. - Fine. You want Roda's ring? You can have it. (clanking) It's not here. - What do you mean? - The ring, it's not there. - Well, maybe you put it somewhere and now you can't remember. - No I remember where I put it. It's here somewhere. - [Brandon] Mom, just wait. Just. - Sorry. I didn't wanna interrupt. Anything I can do? - I think you've done enough. ♪ Hi ho, hi ho ♪ ♪ It's off to work we go ♪ - Great. ♪ Hi ho ♪ ♪ Hi ho ♪ ♪ It's off to work we go ♪ ♪ Hi ho, hi ho ♪ ♪ It's off to work ♪ ♪ Hi ho, hi ho ♪ - Dad, you can't go on the roof by yourself. - Then lend me a hand. - Well you wanted to help. (tarp rattling) Wow, all this for a few solar panels. - Yeah, they're worthless. They never worked. - You probably didn't install them right. - They're connected to the invertor box. I followed the instructions. - Maybe you connected them wrong. - I didn't. - Maybe you think they're connected, but there's a wire loose or something. - I did it right. - Maybe you made a mistake. - I didn't. - Alright, alright. You got it. We got this. We got this. - Now that we're alone, you wanna tell me what's going on? - Like what? - [Brandon] Don't play dumb. Where'd you go? (sighing) - I leased a place over on Grove Street. I can't live with her anymore. - So you are leaving her? - Now you know. Yeah, now you know. (items clanking) - Damn. Yeah, there we go. There we go. (grunting) Yeah. Yeah. What is it? - Nothing. Everything's fine. - Okay, this is how it's gonna go. We're gonna sitch this in real good. Then we'll nail it down with the nail gun. - [Adam] Okay. - [Dicky] Alright. We're gonna need goggles. Alright. - I don't have any goggles. - Well, be extra careful then. Alright? Give me the nail gun. - Hey! What the. What are you doing? You pointing that thing right at me? - Relax I didn't point it at you. - You could've put a nail through my head. - You asked me for the gun. - Put down the gun. - You asked me! - Adam? - What? - Hand me the gun. - I really don't wanna be in the middle of this. - Did you think I was trying to shoot you? - Accidents happen. - You mean like this roof? (items clanking) Dad, the reason there's a hole in the roof is because you forced a 300 pound person to stand on it. - You saying I was responsible for him being 300 pounds? - He binged on peanut butter cups because of the way that you treated him. - Who bought'um the peanut butter cups? - I don't, I don't think we should be doing this. Alright you guys are both obviously heated. So maybe we should go downstairs and maybe we could do this another time. - Are you quitting? - No, I just wanna live. That's all. - Okay, yeah right. (nail gun shooting) - What the fuck! - You left the safety off. - You almost shot me in the skull. - You left the safety off, it's on now. - You almost shoot me and somehow it's my fault? - You left the safety off. - Why can't you take any responsibility? - It's nobody's fault. No one, no one had a fault here. Alright? This was just an accident. - [Mary] Where are you ring? - I wanted to do something father and son. He liked gadgets, so I bought solar panels. I thought he would like to capture electricity, rather than squirrels and possums. You weren't there. - Okay, so once again it's my fault for having a life? - You believe everything your mother tells you, because that's what you wanna believe. - If you never forced him on this roof, he would've never taken any pills. - Who do you think gave him those pills? (items clanking) (sighing) (humming) (nailing) This is how you nail it in. (rumbling) - Travis. (emotional music) - [Adam] Once upon a time, Jack ran away hoping to fill a hole. So he went to a big city full of disfunction where he met the queen of disfunction. But something was still missing. Then one day he arrives at a home where there was a hole in the roof. (emotional music) Then suddenly, Jack found a way to fill the hole. And weirdly, everyone seemed to function just fine. (emotional music) - I made some sandwiches for the drive. I hope you didn't have too terrible a time. - No, I actually think it kind of helped. I got some good ideas for my graphic novel. - Can I see it? - Mm hm. Okay. So, it's not totally done, but here are a few panels. - Is this a happy story? - It's strange, but it's good. - This is fantastic. - Thanks. - Oh, what an artist you are. - Thank you. That means a lot. Coming from you. - You better get going. - Brandon's downstairs just going through some stuff. - I see. - Just waiting on him. - You think he's there for you Adam, but it's the other way around. I'll get the sandwiches. (sighing) (birds chirping) - [Brandon] Hey. - Hey. I packed your stuff in the car. - Oh, hey thanks Adam. - Mm hm. Ah, there's about a quarter tank of gas left, so we're gonna have to stop somewhere. - Listen, I may not go just yet. - No? - No. I can drive you to the train station, but I'm gonna need to stick around a little longer. - What about work? - I'm taking a few days off. - And Yuan? - She thinks it's best if I take some space right now. - Okay. - Yeah, my mom needs me. - Right. (laughing) - This is my old um, goalie mask. (laughing) I used to ah, I told my brother that if he wore this and the helmet that it would keep him safe. But the truth was I liked it when he wore it. Because then I didn't have to be seen with him. I was so fucking ah. - [Mary] Here's the sandwiches. - I'll take the sandwiches. (emotional music) - There you go. (emotional music) - Hmm. I think I'll take my paints outside, do a landscape. Something I can hang and be proud of. Bright and cheerful. Alive with color. - That sounds great Mom. - What are you waiting for? (gasping) - I thought I'd help you clean up the house. - I'm not asking you to do that. - Do you have a Xanax? - Oh dear god. - Hey come on I'm outta weed. - Brandon please don't place me in this position. - You let him have whatever he wanted. - Hey, look at me. Look at my hair. It's curly. Guess what? I don't care anymore. Everyone else always had straight hair. I've carried this straight hair thing with me since the third grade. All the pretty girls had straight hair. But now I can finally say, what do I care what any of these people think? They're not doing anything for me anyway. - What are you trying to say? - The worst thing that could happen has happened. I woke up one morning, and it was like the sun fell down. I thought it was dawn but, the sky was black. And nothing ever made sense to me again. God took one of my children. But he can't have you. - Well I just feel like if I was here. - You can't think like that. - How am I supposed to think? - You have to have faith. (laughing) - Faith? (laughing) I mean. (laughing) You have faith? - In my own way. - Come on Mom, we're gonna paint the walls yellow. Put down new carpets. - [Mary] Brandon. - We're gonna hang your paintings. And we're gonna clean up the kitchen. - I want you to have a good life. - I have a good life. - Then leave. (knocking) - Mind if we get going? - Yeah, uh, you know what I may be going back with you after all. - Let me know how it goes. (sighing) - I love you Mom. You know that right? - My love whore. - Why did you say it? - You said it. - Yeah I know. I did. - What did you mean to say? (sighing) - I think I meant to say, don't leave me. - Oh. (emotional music) - I'll be back. - I know you will. (emotional music) (stuffed animal thudding) (emotional music) - Huh? - Huh? - [Brandon] Nothing. - Nothing.
