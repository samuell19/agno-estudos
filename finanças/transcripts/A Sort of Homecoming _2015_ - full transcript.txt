Amy, can I see you for a second? Yeah, great work, Victor. Catch you in a couple of months. Hey. I need an answer. I gave an answer weeks ago. I've got a flight to catch in three hours. My cab's downstairs. This is a good offer, I want you on the team. Ah, freelance, Hal, freedom, endless new horizons. Five grand more a year, it's the best that I can do. I'm not playing hard to get. Sticking with the on-the-road gambit. I pick Thelma and Louise up on Tuesday. Well, if you hit the Grand Canyon without a body count and find the cash reserves getting low... You'll be my first call. Yes, this is Amy. Annie Landry? Yeah, I know her, knew her, another lifetime ago. Handle it in person? No, I'm sorry, there must be another way. I'm on my way overseas. Please, don't call it home. I'll figure something out. ♫ Rolling down the road ♫ Going nowhere ♫ Guitar packed in the trunk ♫ Somewhere round mile marker 112 ♫ Papa started humming the funk ♫ I got a jones in my bones before they know ♫ We were singing this melody ♫ Stop the car pulled out the guitar ♫ Halfway to New Orleans ♫ Said take me home ♫ Home, home, home ♫ Take me home ♫ Home, home, home ♫ Could feel the sun about to rise ♫ When I realized we had nothing to fear ♫ It's just me and my daddy and a kid named Cope ♫ Making music that nobody would hear ♫ And then the sun let up and it split the night ♫ Spilling over our jubilee ♫ 10,000 cars by the side of the road ♫ Grooving far as the eye can see ♫ Thanks for squeezing me in, Bell. Trying to get this wrapped up quickly. No, no, I don't need directions. Everything's right where I left it. ♫ Home, home, home ♫ Said take me home, home, home ♫ This is a springing power of attorney. Springing? There's a trigger. When the doctor determined that Annie could no longer make decisions for herself, the trigger was sprung. That's when you were notified. I didn't have to approve it? The designee is not required to give consent. I mean, it's unusual that the power would be transferred to someone who's not a relative or close friend, but it is perfectly legal. Okay, so how do I get out of it? You don't. It's binding. What? I have a plane to catch. I have plans 6,000 miles away. I have a life out there. This life ended for me a long time ago. Would you just listen to yourself? Annie is dying and probably soon. She asked for you. Bell, Annie had hundreds of students, taught thousands. I haven't even spoken to her since... Look at us. Look at us. God, that was her whole life, wasn't it? I'm glad you decided to come. I don't issue many personal invitations. You, so good to see you. Everybody, everybody, everybody. Welcome to the first official meeting of the St. Delphine speech and debate team for 1984. We had an amazing time last year, our fifth straight state championship led by the unbelievable team of Miller and Bourke. They came this close, this close, to a national championship. Who's next? Who's here to fill those shoes? If you are here today, in this room, thinking you can be part of this tradition, thinking you can go on trips every weekend to places like Baton Rouge, Lake Charles, Alexandria, Shreveport and its fabulous twin city, Bossier City. Well, how about New Orleans? Is that better? Yeah! Let me hear some noise. And for those of you who work hard enough, who practice long enough, who have the innate smarts and talents, who slip me a little money on the side, New York in October, Chicago in November, Boston in February, Los Angeles, California in April and this year's national championship location, Miami, Florida. Are you in? Yeah. Are you ready to make this team your new home? Yes. To work hard every day, every weekend, forsaking all others and keep the tradition alive? Let's get to work people! Oh, Annie. Been here for weeks by myself since she got so sick. No family, no visitors. How are you related to her? Oh, I'm not. I haven't seen her since high school. We lost touch. Mmm, yeah, there's more to that story. Past is past. I'm here out of an obligation to the paperwork. I'm going to see it through. Past is never past, my friend. But I'm not gonna bug you. Thank you. New York, right? Mostly. I'm a freelance news producer at CZN. It's a bit of an offshore schedule, you know 14 on 14 off. I work for six months or so in New York then travel 'til the money runs out. Ooh, I feel ya. I'd miss my stuff too much. My TV, my crawfish, my mama's rice and gravy. Well, if you've ever seen the sun set over the Pacific... My youngest, Kaylie, is like you, a dreamer. She saw New York on TV and thinks that's where she belongs. Like they're gonna bring out the welcome wagon. What does she study? She's never gonna leave that boyfriend of hers and go anywhere. You're selling her short. You haven't met her yet. Anyway, I gotta run. You mind locking up when you leave? You're leaving Annie alone? Her insurance doesn't pay for a night nurse and she has her pain meds. She'll be out all night and Kathy comes in real early. That doesn't seem right. It doesn't mean you have to stay. Don't I? I thought your obligation was for the paperwork. Yeah. So, can you lock up? When I leave. Thank you. Why? What was so important that you needed to get me back here? - Oh, you came. - Annie. Chop up this bell pepper as finely as you can and could you hand me that onion please? Oh, check the freezer in the carport. We need to use up that shrimp tonight and there may still be some crab meat. Will you go check? It's just two of us. For now. You shouldn't be here. I was invited. You'll upset everything. You need to go, right now. Oh, stop cleaning up. Just sit down here for a minute. Tell me a story. I haven't had a chance to talk to you all night. Tonight was heaven. Wasn't it? Better send off than I could've dreamed. It was something. Didn't you have a good time tonight? Truthfully? Of course. I had a good time. Well, that's not very persuasive. I taught you better than that. Nah, you want a perfomance, huh? I want you to sit here with me. Tell me why. Isn't it enough that I wanted to see you? Come on, Annie, the past was gone, buried. I moved on. Mmm, maybe, but you haven't let go. You asked Nick to leave tonight. I don't have anything to say to him. People leave, Annie. That's the one truth I do know. Isn't that what we're doing here? Waiting for the end. Darling, you're the only one who can decide why you're here. Right, a cosmic riddle. Find peace in uncertainty, find beauty in loss. I don't need a zen Hallmark card, Annie. Loss is loss, love ends. Tell me a story. I haven't had a chance to talk to you all night. You wanna hear the story? As if talking can change the outcome. It started the summer before Nick and I went to debate camp in New Orleans. I couldn't wait to get out of my house. Hey, have you seen this? What the hell, Shane? It's just a joke. That's three weeks of work. That's not funny. Hey, lighten up. You never could take a joke. Right, Shaney? Good job. Hurry up, Chris ain't gonna wait. Y'all ready, boys? And my brother acted like such a jerk. It made me glad I was adopted. Nick was my next stop. That made everything all right. I sensed we had a strong connection, but I had no idea if he felt the same way about me. His family life was no picnic either. He wouldn't even let me pick him up at his house. We were debate partners. That was enough. Debate was where we belonged. What's with the fancy luggage? I had to work late, no time to pack. Your bike? Nick, there's no room. We might be a little squished, but we'll make it work. Even though I tried to act cool, Nick'd flash me that smile, and he'd win every time. Dang it, Shane. Stupid worms. Don't worry about it. There's a Newsweek on the couch. Go get that. Any last minute surprises from your dad? No, he's been offshore. Good, 'cause I told your mom in no uncertain terms that your scholarship to St. Delphines is conditioned on your participation on this debate team, so this summer camp is crucial. And Nick knows. We all know, but I think it's important that we say it out loud while we're here together. Eat. - Thank you. - I mean it, Nick. Everything is open to you, every possible future you can imagine, if, if this year goes the way I think it should. You could be the national champion. The two of you as a team. You, you don't have a tie? Go into Roy's closet, pick out a tie. The nicest one you can find. Okay. Listen... I need you to watch out for him. I know. You are the rock of this team. You're careful, you're responsible. He needs that. All right. I am going to pick this one. Okay. Oh, you guys have to get going if you're gonna get to the airport to pick up Rosa on time. Who's Rosa? A girl from Stuyvesant. Annie told her coach in New York we'd pick her up in New Orleans. Get going, come on. Okay, give me a hug. Get going. - Do your best. - Okay. You guys make me proud. So, um... I need to stop at my sister's place on the way. We don't have time. 10 minutes, I promise. It's important. Five minutes, no other stops. I get to pick the music. Okay. So, um, here's some money from mom and a little bit of what I was able to make. I know it's not enough to fix the car, but I thought I'd leave my bike for a few weeks. I guess that doesn't really help much. Dad bought you that bike. He'll notice it's missing, and it'll give him another reason to go ballistic. He's offshore. Mom will tell him. Maybe. It was a nice thought, thank you. Hey, I have your mail, college brochures. Oh, I don't want to keep Amy waiting any longer. How about I come on the way back from New Orleans? You look like a debater. Rosa? We're here to pick you up. We? That must be Stacen, right? Now it makes sense. Adam told my coach he needed a favor. I agreed to partner with Nick here, and I get my pick of partners at Dartmouth in August. He's your warm-up? Basically. Later, y'all. I'm headed to Cancun. Saint Lucia's nicer. ♫ All the kids just getting out of school ♫ They can't wait to hang out and be cool ♫ Billy Joel, Hall and Oates, I mean, it's so Top 40. It was number one for four weeks. Should've been five, really. No, Smiths, The Cure, I mean, they're replacements, for God's sakes. Dear God, where am I? Oh, sorry, I must have the wrong... I asked to transfer. My first roommate was a bore. I didn't think you'd mind. You play? A little, only mess around. Where's your second camp? Second camp? Yeah. Lucky to get one. Nick too? Mmhmm. Then he'll have to be as naturally talented as everyone keeps saying. But your squad has seniors at other camps, right? Just me and Nick. I saw him at the end of last year in quarter finals with that other guy. Miles. They were fine. Nick was one of the only juniors to get that far. I know. I just don't get the hype. CZN News might cover the finals this year. How do you know? Um, Keith, Adam's assistant, was asking me about a woman who went to my high school a while back. She works for Bill Tarrity now, the news anchor. I know who Bill Tarrity is. We get national TV here. Tarrity was a debater. He was plucked from obscurity in rural Nebraska or something. Won nationals, changed his life. He wants to do an inspiring story about debate with Nick as the star, passing the torch or the boot straps or something. Pick your metaphor. Well, it's good for you, right? I mean, you're Nick's partner here at camp. Why would I care about getting on network news? Spent my whole life dodging my father's camera. Do you sing? No. Come on. No, like, seriously, no. Hello? I'm so sorry for not calling sooner, Annie. We're here, everything's fine. Well, call me again soon. I'm always here. Yeah, I'll call again in a few days. Don't worry. I would like to take this opportunity to formally welcome you to the Summer Debate Institute. Policy debate has produced many national leaders over the generations. Perhaps there's a future governor or senator among you, a future network news anchor or Supreme Court justice. I know that each one of you represent the best of what your generation of young people have to offer this country, and we are delighted to be some small part of your preparation. Lab meetings begin in 15 minutes. Keith here, to my right, has the assignment sheet if you somehow missed it yesterday at check-in. Do me proud. Who has memorized this year's resolution? Mr. Stacen? Do you always do his homework? Rosa, please write the resolution on the board. Mr. Stacen, I expect more from you. I expect more from all of you. This isn't summer vacation. Mr. Carter, proceed. So, the word from the esteemed organization which governs our activities is that some wires, critics, think that we turn out debaters who can't actually give a persuasive speech, that they speed unintelligibly through piles of evidence that they can neither understand nor can make comprehensible to anyone else. That is not how Adam and I run our program up at the paradise on the Charles River that many of you are clamoring to attend, and that is not how I run this lab. If you want to succeed this year, if you think you are capable of being a national champion, if you wanna gain a scholarship to my program, or any other top program for that matter, you have to be a top researcher, a master of logic and reason and a persuasive speaker. You have to do it all. It's a decathlon, not a sprint. We will start with a series of exercises on making persuasive speeches, the kind that you would give to your grandmother or the garden club with the little finger sandwiches. And then, this afternoon, our real work begins. I want 10 affirmative and 10 negative speeches every morning, fully researched. Okay, who's next? We need a topic. Let me see that. Baton Rouge Monthly, really? Okay, topic, topic, what do we got? Contras, no. Gorbachev and Star Wars, no. Deficit, no, we need something with a moral stake, something that the grandmothers will want to hear. If we wanted to talk about moral issues, we would've signed up for Lincoln Douglas. Editorial page, okay. Here's something for the blue hairs. You've all heard of this baby X story, right? Couple hires this mother to have their kid. She changes her mind, steals the baby back. Rosa, should the United States allow surrogate mother contracts or should we ban the practice? Five minutes go, oh, next person takes the opposite side, all around 'til we're done. We need prep. If you need prep, you don't belong in this lab. Rosa, go. - Which side? - Doesn't matter. I can do either, you pick. Against. Women in this country are barely a decade into a new era in which they have full control of their reproductive rights and choices. Medical advances have created new options to solve the unspeakable pain of infertility. Are we going to turn the clock of freedom back now, reducing these choices? Are we going to limit women's rights out of on an irrational fear of the unknown? Okay, I'll see you guys later, okay. Hey, are you okay? I'm fine. Keith almost showed real humanity and sent out a search party. I had some water, I'm okay. Okay. Okay. So, it's all good? Fine, I freaked. Big time. I'm not in this league, in your league. I've only been in one national tournament. I went one and three, total disaster. I'm only in this lab because of Nick, and I'm holding him back. So, that's it, end of story? What? You wouldn't be here if you coach didn't think you had it in you. You're here to learn, right? All right. Show me what you got. Um, okay. Uh, new government spending will trigger automatic cuts, Washington Post, July 8, 1986. The Congressional Budget Office reports today that any additional federal spending - will trigger- - Wait. That's from today. Where'd you get that? Library. That's a great card. You can use that against any affirmative case linked to the disad. - I know. Um... Senators Phil Gramm and Warren Rudman said that they would... Wait, stop, stop. Great cards aren't everything, although I do want a copy of that one. What's in-between? Uh, nothing. To find the connective tissue, the words that link the evidence together, weave the argument, tell a story. But... You can't plan that ahead of time. Exactly. You have to do it on the fly, different every time. Right, it's all improvised, conditioned on what comes before. And that's when I panic. I was terrified too. Once, I think. When I first started. How did you get over it? Just have to let go of everything. Be in the moment, get a flow, a rhythm. It's like, um... It's like music. This is ridiculous. Do you want my help? Yeah. ♫ How badly Very badly. Then sing it. ♫ Sing to me about the deficit ♫ New government spending ♫ New government spending ♫ Will trigger ♫ Will trigger ♫ Automatic budget cuts ♫ Says the Congressional Budget Office ♫ Earlier today I think you're getting it. Oh my God. I urge you to vote affirmative. As Hickman in '85 concludes, early investment in education reduces inequality in both the short and long-term. Not bad, and you used your full eight minutes without stopping. Who's next? A word Mr. Stacen. This is a release form and an envelope with a stamp. Take it, seal it, address it to your parents. Instruct them to mail it back in one week. When these things are accomplished, you will be interviewed by CZN News regarding your prowess. I don't think I need to tell you how important this is. A lazy Louisiana summer was passing outside debate camp, but we were working so hard we barely noticed. I still don't think we have enough evidence here. Do you have the binders Miles left behind from last year? Some are still in the car. So get the keys. Where are you two going? We'll be right back. I didn't think of it before, but it fits. Miles thought I was a crappy researcher. It's good stuff. That means we're done for tonight. I'm hungry. Come on. Come on. Wait. If somebody steals the car... It'll be fine. Not a very convincing argument. - We should go. - Not yet. Assuming my car is still there. Not yet. Nick won that debate. We stayed out that night 'til the sun came up over the river. Did you know they're turning the World's Fair site into a mall? Yeah. Did you go? To the World's Fair? Yeah, I don't remember that much. We went. Me and my mom and my sister. My mom just had to see the Vatican exhibit. Spent the whole day looking at jeweled chalices and crosses. We came back the same night. We pull in. My dad's truck is in the driveway. He's sitting there under the carport in a folding chair having a beer. Some explosion shut the rig down, and he was home early. You weren't suppose to go? I don't know. Who knows what he really wants? My mom, she was just frozen in place, wouldn't move. I mean, he didn't know where we'd been, but... There was nothing wrong with it. We didn't do anything wrong. I just opened the door. Must have broken the spell or something. My mom just fixed her hair, grabbed her pocketbook and started towards him apologizing. I just got on my bike and I rode off. Do you ever... wish you had a different family? I do. Sometimes. I mean, my situation is not like yours. But... I just feel like I don't belong there. Maybe I never have. 'Cause they don't get debate? Because they don't get me. Yeah, I guess we are kinda freaks, huh? ♫ I didn't care ♫ I was alone ♫ Along for the ride ♫ Snuck out at midnight ♫ Came back at ♫ Dawn's early light ♫ I wouldn't have changed a thing ♫ I'm gonna go get some coffee. Yeah, no, yeah, sure. Yeah, I'll see you later. ♫ I wouldn't have changed a thing ♫ Hey, Megan. ♫ I was a volunteer ♫ Along for the ride Inequality is a temporary feature in a growing and vibrant economy. Citation? Council of Economic Advisors, '82. No, you can see that that study was fought in cross ex. Now that claim is unsupported. The preponderance of evidence suggested in this round shows that extreme income inequality is a feature... Temporary feature. Would you please let me finish? I feel something slipping here. Rosa, next please. Opportunities are not evenly distributed in this country. A child born into a lower economic ground has no chance to change their life without federal investment in education. Amy, my brother, Dylan Hello. He's in town doing research for a movie. Well, what a coincidence. Rosa, let me introduce you to, well, you probably already know Susan Levine? She's an up and coming producer at CZN News. No, we haven't met. Rosa is the top debater at Stuyvesant. She's also Nick Stacen's debate partner here at the institute. I've actually heard a lot about you. I would love to interview your father some time. I'm a great admirer of his work. I will be sure to tell him. Please do. His Kennedy film is genius. Ah, my brother, Dylan. Well, you two probably went to Stuyvesant together. No, I think I would remember you. Ready? Tell me again why Susan is here. Due diligence. Tarrity sent her to determine whether the story that we've been pitching matches the facts. If she agrees, then they send an on-air correspondent. But if someone else wins the tournament, then they get on the news. No, Nick's the story. If some overprivileged prep school kid wins, then there's no story. Nick feeds this log cabin myth of national greatness, and Tarrity gets to relive his New York rise. Besides, being on the news is good for you. Tarrity's gonna be on the national news telling every coach and judge in the country that Nick is destined to be the national champion. If he does well in the interview, then the judges will want to make that dream a reality. The judges aren't gonna cheat. It's not cheating. It's politics. It's PR. Look, everyone's good at that level. And short from a major meltdown, the top rounds at the national tournament are determined in millimeters. If Nick's the star, then he gets more of the close calls. I don't know. You don't know what? What, does this ruin some idealistic view of the news industry for you? Or maybe it ruins the idea of debate as a noble pursuit of knowledge. Look, you're a good researcher, and you're improving as a speaker. You're not gonna determine whether Nick wins or loses this year That almost sounded like an apology. I'm doing you a favor. You want to make it in the larger world? How do you get there? I work hard. Then maybe someone will notice? That's a fairy tale. There's no national merit exam that gives everybody what they deserve. You wanna be a New York artist or an intellectual? There's your entrance exam. You wanna be a New York news producer? There's your entrance exam. But at some point, you are going to have to determine where you belong. Winners set the agenda. Losers get the scraps. Oh Keith, could you meet up with my crew at the library, show them around campus? I'd love to get some B-roll before we lose the light. Absolutely. And, Rosa, if you've got some time, I'd love to meet some of the other folks from the lab to determine who to interview tomorrow. Sure. Hey, um, can I get to Delphine Street with public transportation? Not any time soon. I don't suppose I could impose on you for another ride? Sorry to drag you out again. Imagine you have work to do. It's okay. I kinda like being the one with a car. Yeah, I never learned to drive. Ironic, though, my gramps drove a cab for 10 years when he first got here. Not here here, like New York here, America. Yeah. Rosa said you're from New Orleans? About two hours west. New Orleans is the big city to us. Wait, the Cajun part? Yeah. That's great. No, that's actually related to the thing with this guy, Mark, with why I'm here. Uh, Mark grew up in New York but got obsessed with Louisiana ritz music. Came to Jazz Festival one year and had this, like, religious, mystical experience listening to Gatemouth Brown play blues guitar. I mean, you probably know all about this. Look, your sister already gave me a hard time for only listening to Top 40. Why would I tell you what music to like? I'm just... But, look, I mean you're, you're here at the home of jazz and blues. It's an iconic American story. That's what I wanna say in my movie. You make movies? Sure, little documentaries. Like my dad. A movie about a guy who falls in love with Louisiana music. More than that. Story of this New York kid who wakes up one day and has an epiphany and realizes he's been born in the wrong culture, switched at birth, right? So he moves to New Orleans to set things straight. That's him. Uh, hey. Hang out with me. Let's hear his story. Opportunities are not evenly distributed in this country. A child born into a lower economic ground has no chance to change their life without federal investment in education or federal regulation of educational standards. As the University of Iowa City shows, there's significant... Perfect. You don't need my scrutiny. Well, if you can spare someone, Keith, I could use a volunteer to help with the crews while we set up for the interviews. Anyone? Great. So forget about me. Look directly into the camera. Rodney's gonna adjust the lights. It just helps to have a body in the chair. Are you interested in news? As a job? As a career. You said travel's the best part of your job. And you research stories, right? I'm good at that. Good. Okay. Um, do you know anyone? Friends of your parents or other relatives, someone who could help you with a summer job, maybe? Oh, you know what? Look this way. We're just gonna move the camera, okay? And we're gonna get a level now, so I just want you to speak slowly and clearly into the microphone. Uh, what should I say? Oh, anything, it's just a test. I'm sorry, I'm screwing this up. No, wait. Hey, hey, hey, Anything at all, okay? Who are you? I'm Amy Hartington. I live in a small town in south Louisiana. I'm a debater. And what are your plans for the future? You want me to say that out loud? On camera? I do. Keep talking. I wanna win a national championship with my partner. I wanna debate in college in a big city. I wanna travel everywhere and see the whole world. I want the best parts of debate to never end. One minute it's boiling hot. Then it's really cold. The rain, the mud, the humidity. How do you people live here? You'll escape to Dartmouth next week for your next camp, and this will all be a bad dream. Come with me. Just the person I'm looking for. Your partner's still playing hide and seek. Adam clearly asked Nick to get his parents to sign the release forms for the people at CZN News. Nick hasn't done so. So? So, Adam communicated directly to Nick's parents and sent the forms to them. He'll be contacting Nick's dad tonight. So if you see Nick, be sure to convey that information. I really don't understand why this matters so much to Adam. Ego, he's a dictator in his own program. Worse than he is here. My brother bailed. Dylan was supposed to debate for him? He did for six months, but he was miserable. Life's too short. Nick needs a scholarship to anywhere. Nick can't burn too many bridges if he needs a debate scholarship. Adam's wired with all the good college coaches. Would you talk to him? Why are you always looking out for him? He shouldn't be your problem. You're only his partner for this camp tournament. He's my partner all year. We win or lose together. Find another partner. Then I won't get invited to the best national tournaments. You're selling yourself short. Mexico. Um, Mexico as new affirmative case, as a new counter plan? As a destination. Sure, I'd love to go sometime, but... Now. The best part is we can drive. You can drop me off in Mexico City. Drop you off? I mean, you can stay if you want, too. But, um, I mean, you love debate, right? Just because I'm done with it doesn't mean you have to quit. Keith says this interview will be good for you. Keith doesn't know my father. I spend half of my life covering for things that might possibly piss the man off. Adam shouldn't have gone behind my back and called him. A scholarship from Adam gets you away from your father. Forever, if you want. You're not gonna help me, are you? Help you leave? No. Nick, wait. Look, I'm not gonna pretend to understand your father. But don't run away. We can call Annie. There's got to be another solution we're not thinking of on our own. I don't like it. Tarrity's not gonna like it. Well, it will get you what you want, Adam. We're all clear here, but I've made no guarantees. All right, well, I'm gonna see you next week. Hey, what did you hear? Nothing. Oh, you can put the pieces together. What did you surmise? This is a test? Everything's a test, my dear, one way or another. We have a deal, a precarious one, but his dad will sign the release form if CZN agrees to interview him as well. Nick's dad wants to be on TV? He says that he spent the best years of his life sacrificing for his son and that he deserves some of the glory. Nick's not gonna be happy with that. I know. Sign of a good compromise, no one is happy. I thought adults were more reasonable. Now you know. All right, I'll see you next week. Amy. Still wanna learn about the news business? I guess. Well, help me out with something, okay? We'll call it an internship. I'll write you a nice recommendation letter. I appreciate it. I just, uh, didn't really want anyone else to know, you know? I actually don't know anything about debate. The rules? Yeah, I may have led my boss to believe that I had some sort of background familiarity. Okay. Yeah, I bluffed. Just give me the basics. This is the resolution, the topic we debate all year. At each tournament, there are four preliminary rounds. In one round, you argue the affirmative, often a case, a government policy that upholds the resolution. In the next round, you take the negative position, arguing against the resolution. Each person gives an eight minute speech, then is cross-examined by someone on the opposite team. Then, each person gives a four minute rebuttal. The judge examines the arguments against a set of standards and then decides who wins the round. The team with the best records advances to quarter finals then semi-finals until only two best teams are left competing against one another in the final round. Only one team can win. Perfect. That's exactly what we needed. That was fun. Your parents are gonna be so proud of you when they see you on TV. Thank you for your cooperation with the permission form. So that's it? You know, I just have to get the final interview with Nick and then we'll edit the package for tonight's news. The affirmative team's absolutely correct. We can see that programs for reducing inequality are necessary, even crucial for... Debate camp's final tournament had arrived. Everyone was going to be there, you, Nick's parents. It was Nick's moment to shine for the news cameras and for his dad. Almost done? Maybe 20 minutes. Oh my God, watch and learn, kid. Mr. Tarrity, what a surprise. Well, we're starting off the road show early, pumping up the affiliates' ratings. Oh, you're gonna anchor from New Orleans tonight? From the local news room. Everything's under control. But I was just telling my old friend, Adam, here, how much I miss real reporting out side the New York bubble, and I hear there's one more interview to get for tonight, is that right? Yeah, Michael Sullivan is in the ballroom - just getting ready. - Oh, great. Sully, outta my chair son. I'm the field correspondent today. Amy, I've got Nick's parents here. Are you taking them in the finals? That's what I'm trying to decide. Hey, Bill Tarrity. Yes. Noland Stacen. We're supposed to talk. Well, if I had words with everyone who wanted a bit of my time, we'd be here for hours, wouldn't we? Is it final rebuttals tonight? Yeah. Okay. Here goes nothing. The affirmative team has not defeated our counter plan. State control is clearly superior, Osborne '82 evidence. Local control allows state. Go to the counter plan next. You have time, Nick. Hit everything. To experiment and find novel solutions. On their A, uniform federal standards, pull across the O'Conner card. They haven't even touched it. Judges, this is not a difficult decision. The preponderance of evidence is on our side. To solve for inequality, you must vote negative. Well done, Nick. So I want you to tell us about the final round, and then we'll take you in here for the interview. Nick, come here. Nick, I'd like you to meet Mr. Tarrity. Son, I'm talking to you. You are ungrateful. What's going on over there? Who is that? Is that his dad? What's he doing? This is a school. After his father burned the permission slip, embarrassing him in front of everyone, Nick stormed out. The look on his face made me think he might be going for good. I assume you can get this to Nick? If I see him again. Somehow you'll survive. I can't do debate without Nick. It's a team activity. Whoa, whoa, hey. There you go. It's okay. You have to let go soon, darling. Doctor says it's time for hospice. We're leaving in a few minutes. Go change. You've completely forgotten, haven't you? Your cousin Kathy's wedding. Honestly, Amy, I don't know where your head is sometimes. Great, have a good time. Don't sass me, young lady. Apologize to your mother. You don't even know what happened. Don't you debate with me. That kinda talk doesn't belong here. I'm sorry. That's better. I, uh, wanna show this to you. Oh, sweetheart, the VCR's not even hooked up. It's my piece on the news where I explain debate. I know you didn't see it when it was on last night. Well, Shane had a baseball game. He got three hits. Let's go Charlene. We're going to be late. Amy, please, go get changed. You know how Father Mouton gets when people walk into mass late. Go, I'll meet you at the church. Soon. 10 minutes, I have my car. Okay, well, I put a nice dress on the bed for ya. Wear a slip. Of course. Coming. Oh, what in the world are you doing here this late? I didn't have anywhere else to go. Well, I was just gonna go to bed. I could just keep driving, you know, head west, not stop 'til I hit the Pacific. Come on in. Oh, honey, Nick will be back. How do you know? I don't know. I trust. It's highly preferable to despair. There's something else. It's not about debate. Well, I got other skills. Would you open this for me? Is it a particularly fortified envelope? Booby trapped somehow? Please. It's from the agency that did my adoption. Oh, I always assumed you had a closed adoption. I did. I've always known. We just don't talk about it. Well, that's a lot to hold in. Just read it for me. All right, well. There's a lot of legal jargon. "State laws are under review." Okay. "The adoption records remain sealed, "but the agency does feel obligated" "to reveal certain communications." Bottom line, please. Three years ago, your birth mother, she attempted to make contact with you. She had a friend call the agency. That friend's name and number are here. No, I can't. Where is she? New York, Brooklyn. That's a good distance. Listen, Amy. You have to feel pain before you can let it go. You know, when my son died... Wait. What? When? It happened a long time ago. It was a stupid accident. The details aren't important, but for a very long time, I didn't handle the loss very well. I may have went to work every day. I went through all the motions, but I wasn't really there. I was a ghost. And then one spring, I think it was in a state tournament, I got in a fight with one of the other coaches. Something about the proper allocation of judges for the finals, I don't even remember, but I was absolutely outraged. I screamed at him and anyone else who had the misfortune of being there. And I threw a chair clear across the room. Honestly? Oh, yeah. He ducked. And then I left. I disappeared without a word. And I stayed gone for almost a year. Roy must have been frantic. You didn't care? Not really. I went to Europe. I went to Spain and France and Italy. I'd never been. I blew through my life savings. This isn't a parable. I wound up in Valencia that next spring. They got a wonderful festival there. It's called the Falles. It's a bit like Mardi Gras, the whole town celebrates. They build these gigantic figures out of wood and paper mache, animals, mythical creatures, anything you can imagine. They parade them through the town, and on the last night everyone gathers, and they set each masterpiece aflame. They set those spirits free. And these fires burn all night. And there's music and dancing and there's some crying. And then the next day, they start building all over again. I'd like to see it some time. We should go together. I'd like that. Yeah. But something happened to me that night. I came back here the next week, and I started coaching again. Back to normal? No. But I found a way to move on, to remember who I was and why I was here. That was enough. Three years later, they had the World's Fair here in New Orleans, and I bought a paper mache globe. You know, it was just a cheap souvenir, really, but it reminded me of the Falles. Did you burn it? No, it's the one I have in my classroom. You know what, honey? You'd better get home. We've got a big year ahead of us. I didn't hear another word from Nick all summer until he walked back in the first day of school. I was so relieved, and things went back to normal, mostly. You were there. It was the ordinary routine of school and tournaments. We were winning, having fun. Nick's dad was away. It was almost time for graduation, and Nick and I were so excited for nationals in New York. Unbelievable. That bad, huh? Yeah, I'm afraid so. The school board is requesting half of everyone's remaining budget so that the football stadium can be built in time. But the rest of this year's budget covers nationals. Yeah. Can you give me a minute, please, guys? I need you to clear out. Base classroom is empty. I need to talk to Amy alone as the team captain. We'll go to New York alone? I don't see that there's any other way. I mean, if I don't go, that's an extra $1000. And then if you find a place to stay... I'll call Rosa tonight. Okay, that's another 500. Oh my God, this is crazy. I cannot believe they are forcing us into this position when you guys have worked so hard all year. A football? I mean, you know, it doesn't matter how many championships we win as long, okay, I'm sorry. All right, solutions. We got to focus on solutions. Uh, permission slips. We got to do this by the book. Your parents have to sign, and Nick's parents have to sign. Of course. Okay. This might work. It was a scramble, but the moment we arrived to New York for the championship tournament mad it all worth it. Hey, so do you two have everything you need? We're taking the train downtown to my place. - Think so. - Yeah. we're all good. - You nervous? - Should I be? If you still wanna debate for Adam next year. You were wait listed, right? Yep. But he can't go without a scholarship. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't have to spill that every time. So, breaking news, Ashoke from Bronc Science just turned Adam down in favor of Stanford. One slot remaining. Intriguing. So you're not changing your mind? About debating in college? No way. That phase of my life ends this weekend. I'm winning here and leaving debate in the rearview. I knew there was some reason I liked you. Can we get outta here? ♫ Maybe I should drop you at your door ♫ Or leave tonight and vanish up the shore ♫ Anywhere but here Make yourselves at home. Amy, I made you up the bedroom upstairs and, Nick, you're on the couch. This is amazing. Hey, good, I didn't miss you. Let me help you with that. I should thank your parents. They are sailing, I think, in the Caymans. I don't really keep track. Rosa would know. In summer, you can see the Fourth of July fireworks over the river. Bring up one of those plastic kiddie pools, couple of folding chairs. No beach house? Yeah, on the weekend. Louisiana doesn't even have a real beach. It's all marsh and mud. Mississippi gets all the sand. Born on the wrong side of the river. Something like that. New York must be culture shock for you. No. New York's on TV every day, in the movies and nearly every book I've ever read. Sesame Street's in New York, for God's sake. I feel like I've known New York all my life. Is there something wrong with me coming here tonight? I wanted to see you. I'm sorry, I just have a lot on my mind for the tournament tomorrow. I'm glad you wanted to see me. I'm glad. Whatever happened with your New Orleans movie? I don't know, actually. I'm helping my dad do some camera work on one of his projects. Rosa and I are going to Greece and Italy after she graduates. This other guy wants me to make a short about this classic sailboat he's restoring up in Maine. Lot of possibilities. I guess I sound like a privileged jerk. It's just not my world. You don't know that. You don't even know how different we are. What kind of head start you have over people who don't grow up like this. Why is it a competition? Nick and I need scholarships to get to a good college. And people like you start off so far ahead you don't even have to compete. You can make a little movie or not. Debate for Adam or not. Go to Europe or go slumming in New Orleans. It's not that easy. For anyone. My whole life could've been different. Another name, hometown, family. What do you mean? I'm adopted. Lots of people are adopted. No one ever talks about how it feels on the inside. If the bureaucrat from the adoption agency had chosen from column A instead of column B, I'd be a different person. It's completely random. Which way is Brooklyn? Follow the lights over the bridge. Over the East River. Last summer, I got a letter. A woman in Brooklyn claimed she knew my birth mother and wanted to talk to me. And? I didn't respond. My coach said I would do it when I was ready. Here I am in New York for three days. Are you ready? I don't know. Maybe after the tournament. Debate comes first. Yes. Mr. Stacen. Congratulations. Thank you. I don't wish to reward your behavior last summer, but I understand there were extenuating circumstances. Yes, sir. I'm also willing to consider that you're nearly a year older and that you may have matured into the kind of young man who could be a good fit for my squad. If you advance as far as finals tomorrow, I may have a place for you. And if I don't? Debate's not everything, son. I want to make sure you have the key for the apartment. Uh, yeah. Will we see you later? Actually, my coach has rooms for us here at the hotel tonight, so we can get an extra hour of sleep before the early morning rounds. So we should go back alone? Yeah, you remember how to get there, right? Just take the D to West Fourth. Like we belong here. What's this? I have no idea. But you can use the phone in the coach's lounge to return their call. Hello? Is Nick with you? Uh, he's in the lobby. We had a great day. Four zero in prelims. That's wonderful. I'm proud of you both. All right, Mr. Stacen is here with me in Principal Herbert's office. That sounds bad. It's very serious. Mr. Stacen does not approve of this trip, although Nick's mother signed the permission form. Mr. Stacen wants Nick to return home as soon as possible. Quarter finals are first thing in the morning. I've talked to the airline. Your tickets are valid for any flight before your scheduled return. Do you have a pen, hun? Okay, there are flights at 6am, 9:30... Wait, we can win this tournament. Where's the compromise? It's out of my hands. Everything we worked for. As soon as possible, do you understand? Yes, ma'am. Suddenly, I had my own internal debate. Was there a way I could break the rules and still win? Everything okay? Why wouldn't it be? Well, I hear you guys did a good job today. - Yeah. - We did. I'll be judging all day tomorrow. Perhaps I'll see you. Food? Hmm? I'm starving, let's go get something to eat. You're not gonna let them mess with you, are you? What? It's what he wants. It's what Adam wants, to sike us out, prove he was right about me all along. Were you paying attention at all today, Nick? I'm doing everything I can to win this tournament. You don't know everything that's going on. And you don't think we should track this lady down? Tonight? You have a round in eight hours in a tournament that can change everything, get us scholarships that can let us out of Louisiana. Yeah, but this could change everything. You don't understand. No, I might be the only one who does. I've got to live every day for the rest of my life knowing that I share half of my DNA with an idiot who thinks it's fun to bully his wife and his children. I could go anywhere right now, but anywhere I go I'm stuck with him in my blood. I mean, this could be the winning lottery ticket. Don't you want to know? What if I don't? I don't have all the facts, right? No evidence. We can piece together the outlines of the story without knowing everything. You're assuming too much. Think about it. My real mom is not gonna be someone like Annie. Maybe. She was a teenager who got drunk and made a mistake. Or a woman living in a trailer with a deadbeat husband and four other kids. Or a woman who just wanted out. Yeah, but... I was her problem. She solved it by leaving, drove away and never looked back. And I'm suppose to leave it in the past. Never talk about it, never think about it, never feel it. Move on. She might regret... There's no happy ending here. I don't believe that. This is an address for a bar in Brooklyn, right? All I'm suggesting is that we go in and we have a look around. We can leave whenever you want. We leave all the possibilities open. Come on. When have I ever led you astray? Hi, um, do you know who this is? Thanks. I'm gonna go talk to her. No. I'll do it. What'll it be? Um, yeah, a beer, a beer, please. Two beers. Amy, wait. She can't be the one. It's the wrong ending. You don't know that, go talk to her. It's not her. I know it. I don't wanna settle. I want the dream. ♫ I find myself standing there ♫ With nothing to say We should get off here. No, Rosa's is the next stop. Trust me. Spin it. What? That's what the sign says. You close your eyes, you spin the globe, and then you point. Then the bartender makes you a drink from there. What if I don't like it? Where's your sense of adventure? The sun will be up soon. Yeah. Maybe we should get a little sleep before finals. Sure. What? I'm not going back after the tournament ends. Of course you are. I have your plane ticket. It's not like last summer. I'm not running away. It's just whatever's next, whatever's in the new start for me, it's right there. And I don't know if I'll ever get this close again. Things will look different tomorrow, after finals. Win or lose, I'm not going back. You win, I lose. You'll be fine. Don't tell me how I'll feel. I wish there was another way. There has to be. Trust me. Hey, I didn't think you guys were gonna make it in time. We had to pack. We have to get back to the airport whenever we wrap up here today. Okay, great. I'm glad you guys made it. I'll see you later. Just you? Today's your lucky day. We had some trouble finding enough judges this early in the morning. You'll get a panel on the next round, if you make it. Hey. You awake? Don't wanna affect the round. Judge, would you like to share your philosophy now? Tabula rasa, blank slate. No preconditions, no outside baggage. Do the summary at the end. Weigh the issues. Tell me why I should vote for you. You determine your own fate in this round. Call at flip. Call. Heads. It's heads. We'll take affirmative. We've shown conclusively throughout this round that income inequality reduces educational opportunities or millions of Americans, reducing their chance to reach their full potential, limiting their endless horizons that should be their birth right as citizens of this great country. You owe me one. I didn't ask for any favors. The round was in a mess. Sloppy argumentation on both sides and that ridiculous time you spent on that counter plan? I shouldn't have voted for anyone. That's not the way it works. You tied it up at the end. You told me how to weigh the evidence. The other team couldn't even manage that much. Thank you. You got a hell of a round coming up. What is Adam doing here? For the record, this is the semi-final round between Stuyvensant A and St. Delphine A. This is an elimination round. Winners advance to finals. Everyone in the right place? Judges, raise your hands please. One, two, where is my third judge? Excellent. Do we have a time keeper? Let's try and start in the next 10 minutes, keep things moving. Coin toss. I urge you to vote negative, thank you. Okay, we've heard both sides. Final rebuttals? I'm ready. Judges, Nick, Amy, I'll go case side first, in order. Briefly to the counter plan, disads one through three, and on their deficit argument. Over a full year of debating this topic, I have yet to come across another affirmative case that upholds the resolution better than ours. No prep? No. Where we going? Same order. Case side counter plan. No, case side, all the disads, counter plan last. Let's do it. The affirmative is right about one thing. This is an extraordinary set of policy proposals. Guaranteed minimum income would be the greatest expansion of government powers since the new deal. What comes along with that sort of financial windfall? Rules, regulations and criminal penalties for defiance. You must vote negative to preserve individual freedom. Finals will begin promptly at 2pm in the auditorium. Thank you. On a two to one decision, the round goes to St. Delphine A, Stacen and Hartington. Thank you everyone. Congratulations. I've trained you well. Maybe too well. Ten minutes to finals. I gotta get something to eat. I'll get you something. Ashoke says GPS is gonna run a new variation on warfare. Greenbrier has the best neg against that. Go and see if Omar has the brief. Great, see you later. I told you things would work out. Here? Everything. No, this is actually my favorite part in the round. Nothing's been said yet. I can imagine how it'll all play out. Nothing messed up. No arguments dropped. No mistakes. We're gonna win. Why don't you go get set up and I'll track down Alex and Omar with the briefs. Where's Nick? They're breathing down my neck to get this round started on time. He had to get something. Every other event is done. People have flights to catch. He'll be right back, like two minutes. You're first A seat, right? Yeah. Get started. Seriously? Do it before I change my mind. We're gonna get started. Mr. Stacen will be with us momentarily. Are judges ready? Opponents ready? Resolved. The federal government should establish a comprehensive national policy to substantially reduce income inequality in the United States. The affirmative upholds this resolution by presenting the fallen policy. The most pressing issue right now is an incredible rising interest rate on Stafford Loans. The United States Government will expand its program of loans and grants. A bigger picture is that these borrowers are delaying major life decisions like buying a home or car as a result of their student loans. The rate of home ownership is 36% less student debt for all qualified college students. A comprehensive national could substantially reduce income inequality in the United States. Nick's gone. I don't think he's coming back. Plank A, income inequality is increasing. Plank B, access to education preserves economic mobility. Subpoint one... I'd been thinking everything would be fine if we won. I never dreamed Nick would disappear for good and that you'd be fired. I did it. Keith says I'll get my scholarship out of Louisiana. I'm happy for you. You'll do well. But Amy, I am angry with you too. You have to understand. What you did in New York had consequences for others. It's not my fault. I treated you as an adult. I put everything on the line for the two of you. I told you to get back on that first flight, didn't I? Yes ma'am. Well. I don't know when I'm gonna be able to trust you again. After that, I didn't know where to go. I drove to my parents' house, but I couldn't go in. With you and Nick both gone, I didn't have a home here. And I didn't think it would ever be possible to create a new one anywhere. All I could feel was loss. We all left each other. And we never talked about it. And I put it in the past and I sealed it up tight. And I thought I moved on. But now I realize if the adoption agency had chosen from column A instead of column B, you wouldn't have been in my life. Maybe lots of life is random. But I was lucky to have you. You stayed with me all along. ♫ New Orleans ladies ♫ Sassy style that will ♫ Drive you crazy ♫ And they hold you like the light ♫ Hugs the wick ♫ When this candles burnin' ♫ Them Creole babies ♫ Thin and brown ♫ And downright lazy We need our own ritual. ♫ A little wave ♫ Will last forever ♫ All the way ♫ From Bourbon Street ♫ To Esplanade ♫ They sashay by ♫ They sashay by ♫ New Orleans ladies I got the papers ready in my office.
