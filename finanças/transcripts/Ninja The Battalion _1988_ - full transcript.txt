(dramatic music) (men yelling) [Man] No, no there! (bomb exploding) (screaming) (martial music) (groaning) [Man] Let's get them! [Man] Oh no, run! (bomb exploding) (screaming) (martial music) (groaning) (martial music) [Man] We actually go for the runaway. (yelling) (bomb exploding) (screaming) (martial music) (bomb exploding) (screaming) (martial music) [Man] Hey, hold it! Come on, come on! (martial music) (birds chirping) [Ken] Twelve noon, in Central Park, and the password is... Battalion. (footsteps) (dramatic music) (footsteps) (dramatic orchestral music) (footsteps) (birds chirping) What was that? Oye! (birds chirping) God, he's late again. (dramatic music) (mumbling) (repetitive thudding) You picked the wrong one. You look suspicious, so you must be a Chinese spy! No I'm not, what made you say that? Then you tell us, why do you want to fight us? To protect myself. You what? I don't believe you. Hey! (yelling) (repetitive thudding) (whooshing) (repetitive thudding) (dramatic music) Can we please stop this little game? No way! You Chinese pig, kill me if you want! Do you think I won't? One Japanese warrior is worth a measly thousand Chinese. Huh? Hm. (suspense music) (groaning) (dramatic music) (whooshing) (clanging) (whooshing) (yelling) (clanging) (repetitive thudding) (clanging) (yelling) (thudding) (yelling) (repetitive thudding) (dramatic music) I'm Steven, Ken asked me here. Oh, me too. Let's take care of them quick, or they'll be back for revenge later on. (intense dramatic music) (knocking on door) [Boss] Enter. (dramatic music) My name is Ken Yong, the number one secret agent. David Cheoung, technical consultant. Ronnie Fong, intelligence agent. Georgie Cook, military expert. Frank Lao, munitions expert. They're bacterial experts. Experts in the use of germ warfare. The Japanese seized them in Shanghai, so our spy there tells us. Ken, your mission's to rescue them in Shanghai, and bring them back unharmed to me, safe and sound. Neither the Chinese nor the United States wants them in the hands of the Japanese. We can't afford an incident. Mm. Don't worry, you won't be on your own. Wolves' Squad will help you, and my special agent. But it's still going to be dangerous. Don't underestimate the Japanese enemy. They're cunning and cruel. So be very careful. My special agent can be contacted, but only in emergencies. This is your identification signal. (dramatic music) (intense dramatic music) Well, this is a great chance to help our nation. I welcome you to my group. Now Ken, we will try to help you in every possible way to rescue those four scientists. We'll find them, I am sure. Don't worry. But we must plan first. You are wise. I take your advice. Good. Well, I must summon all my men. We have the element of surprise. We must use it well. Take one, Alex? [Alex] Mm-hm. Thanks. Out in the country, it's a luxury. Lots of people in the country don't appreciate it. (sighing) When will this war be over? That's why we're here in Shanghai, to win this war earlier. Well, I just hope it's soon. [Steven] Hm. [Ken] Gentlemen. Uh, boss! Four germ warfare experts have been kidnapped. And our mission now is to rescue them from the Japanese. If we don't find and rescue these men, it'll undoubtedly lengthen the war. Mm. Now you two are to gather information on their whereabouts and pass it on to me. I know that I don't have to add, but this is top secret. - Yes. - Yes. (intense dramatic music) (whooshing) (repetitive thudding) (groaning) (whooshing) (whooshing) (clanging) (intense dramatic music) This way, sir. [Man] Please be seated. Please, sit down, thank you. [Man] Thank you, yes. (intense dramatic music) How's it going? What do you reckon? (laughs) (people murmuring) Mm. Hi. Tell me, sir, been to Shanghai before? - A drink sir? - Watch your tongue, if you want to get paid. Sorry, sir. Some tea. [Waiter] Uh-huh. Hmm. (people murmuring) [Man's inner voice] Wolves' brother. (dramatic music) No, later, thanks. Oh, okay. (people murmuring) [Ken's inner voice] And thrice the phoenix nods. [Man's inner voice] He needs help. Master, I'm real thirsty after all that hard work. Maybe I... (groans) (dramatic music) [Man's inner voice] I offer my services. (intense dramatic music) Ah. Lord Clay, someone to see you. Mm. (dramatic music) Tell me your name, please. I am Ken Yong. Sit down. I suppose that you're all aware of the Mitsui Company in Shanghai. Mm. It's a cover for Japanese agents. I'm here on a mission from our government, to rescue four scientists held by Mitsui. And I'm asking you for your cooperation in this. Please. Oh, wait a moment. We have many good, brave men. But there are two in particular. These I would trust in this dangerous mission. Tell me, who do we have undercover at the moment? Sir, we have our special agent, called Joey. (dramatic music) (screaming) So now, you tell me, where are you going to hide? Talk. I want you to tell me everything. Come on, talk! (man screaming) So, you found some guts while you were away! Huh? (men screaming) Huh. (switches clicking) (men screaming) Joey, Mr. Nakamura said don't use torture. He wants to keep these four alive in one piece. (chuckling) Don't you worry now. I'll just teach them a lesson so that they know who's boss, so that they don't think that we're soft. (chuckling) So, now, how do you feel? This will teach you that the Japanese are to be obeyed, huh? (screaming) (electric buzzing) (groaning) Tell me, you're feeling better? The Wolves, they are all of one family. (slapping) (groaning) Hm, no guts. Just like I thought, you're spineless! So, what about you? Do you have the stomach for this, or not? Hm? (electric buzzing) (screaming) (chains rattling) (groaning) (dramatic music) Listen. Remember this code sign? It's the Wolves'. Huh? What a brave man! Not to mind torture. (chuckling) Nothing brave when there's no choice. No, he's not brave. (chuckling) (Chinese pop music) (people laughing) [Man] Over here! [Man] Come on. [Man] Hey, take a seat. (mumbling) [Man] Yeah, come on, sit down! [Man] Hey, I like your suit. You must be doing well for yourself. - Yeah. - Pretty nice. Hey, cut that out, we're friends now, aren't we, hey? (laughing) (Chinese pop music) Boss, my greetings! When did you get here? Oh, well... I just came in and saw you dancing here with this miss beautiful Eliza! Well, it's good to see you. (chuckles) I hear you're doing well. Yes. Things are going very well for me now, in a Japanese Company. I'm a manager. (chuckles) Some congratulations are due to you. Oh, thank you! (chuckles) So, I heard you here and I wanted to have a quiet word with you. Maybe after all the help I gave you before, I could do you a favor. Something that could help both of us, huh? What favor? Tell me, do you remember this, huh? Of course. It's the Wolves ID signal. Mm, right. Remember when the Wolves brothers beat us? They used that as a hand signal and now... I've seen it again, just today. It's strange, I tell you. What do you make of it, then, hey? I saw it, I did. Where did you see it? In an office of the Mitsui Company. A colleague called Joey. He used this gesture, just like this and that. Uh-huh. See you later. Have some fun. (Chinese pop music) (splashing) (groaning) Okay, you'd better come out with it! Tell me! (groaning) I won't work for you. We'll see! (splashing) (groaning) Now talk! (groaning) (repetitive thudding) You'd better do try. (groaning) Are you sure it's eight tonight? Boss, absolutely! Now, why would I want to tell you a lie? Good. Now, if we can just grab those four... We'll be rich, you and me both. (chuckling) Boss, every nation needs such experts for germ warfare, and if we can get them, we'll sell them to the highest bidder. Hm... It must be God's will, our time has come at last. (laughing hysterically) (clicking) (men murmuring) [Man] Okay, Chen, you'd better open. [Man] Yeah, okay. I bet three. [Man] Now I bet two. [Man] Where's the bag, huh? (crashing) (yelling) (screaming) (frantic suspense music) (suspense music) [Joey] How is it going? (mumbling) (thudding) [Guard] Oh, hey! What's happening? Nothing, nothing. (thudding) (groaning) (dramatic music) (mumbling) (dramatic music) They're here? I hope so. Hide, hide! (dramatic music) (mumbling), the four scientists (mumbling). Go hide. (thudding) (thudding) (groaning) [Man] Killer. (gunfire) (groaning) (yelling) (groaning) Remember the good times. (groaning) (gunfire) (screaming) Oh, yeah, let's go! (dramatic music) Come here, come on! (gunfire) (screaming) (gunfire) (screaming) What happened? Let's go, come on! [Man] All right. Bullshit! That's ridiculous! They disappeared from under your noses! You're soldiers, some of our country's elite! You'd better find them. Every single one of them. And if you don't, I'll have your heads. Go! [All the men] Yes, sir. Uh! Bloody hell! (humming) Hey, what's the matter with you? Huh? Oh! Let me comfort you. (chuckles) Hey, I know I can please you, if you'll let me. (laughing) So, my sweet, how long have you been here? I've been here for ages, but didn't want to disturb you. I'm tired of waiting now. (chuckling) I would have felt much better if you disturbed me earlier. Now I'm okay. I promise to be good. (chuckles) Hey, you know that you are the most important man in my life? Yeah. But I don't wonder... Yes. If you still remember me. All those other beautiful women you know made me so very, very jealous. (laughing) Of course, how could I forget you?! My heart, my soul, it's all yours. Here. You can feel. Feel, feel it. You naughty man! (laughing) (thudding) Well, now we don't know where any of them are. Hm. Mark, you spread the word around town, we need to find these guys quickly. [Mark] Sir. (dramatic music) [Man] The friendship of all brothers... Illuminate the brothers' name. Remember, forever, the Wolves' name. (dramatic music) [Everyone] The Wolves' name will last forever. (dramatic music) [Man] Our nation is in trouble. Everyone must help. (clattering) (dramatic music) Hm. Hm. There's a bunch still looking for those four guys. Situation is getting sticky. What are you worried about? Come on, boss will arrive soon. He's very powerful and willing to spend all of his money. It's a great opportunity. It's a great opportunity! Yes, it is. If we can find those four men, our promotions will be assured. Yeah, yeah, they will. It's gonna work. (dramatic music) [Man] For the prosperity of the nation... All must pay a price. (ominous music) Man has one master. Madman seven master. Man will die because his death is real. I accept death as death will certainly come to me. My friend, we have the same master. What can we do to help? Please, brother Wolves, help me find the four missing men. Thanks. Uh? Oh! What the hell is going on, I wonder! People giving help! Mm, well, we'll see. Hey, excuse me, I got to go now. Back soon. (chuckles) Uh? Hey, hey! (thudding) (repetitive thudding) (yelling) (whooshing) (thudding) (groaning) (repetitive thudding) (groaning) (repetitive thudding) (clapping) Oh. Yeah! Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. Uh! A man has only one master! Uh, eh? Oh, a brother, uh... Man has only one master. Asshole! Hm. Oh. Hey, yeah, uh. All right, yeah. (dramatic music) Is there anything I can do? Huh! Well, yes, there is. You can show me a good time, huh? (thudding) (groaning) (yelling) (repetitive thudding) (groaning) Little brother, what are you doing? Why are you making trouble? Ya, ya, hi! (repetitive thudding) Sister, how about that one? Can we take him back to the temple? Okay. We'll show him a good time, if that's what he really wants. Bring him. (groaning) (yelling) (repetitive thudding) Oh. No. Hey, I forgot my gun! Hey, you know you're really something? I believe you. Uh... Forgive me, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean all of this. Please, forgive me, please! (groans) Bring him! (groans) (car doors slamming shut) (car engine roaring) (clattering) So, who's the boss? Who do you think he is? He's right here. You're a boss, you're a boss! You wanna die? So why do you kidnap me? I ain't got no money. Didn't you hear me? Tell me, who's the boss?! (grunting) (repetitive thudding) (groaning) (yelling) (repetitive thudding) (groaning) Got it! (groaning) Now, who's your boss? Hmm? I don't, I don't know anything about the boss? All right. Who are the four guys? I don't know. I don't know anything. Shit! Let me show you something. What are you doing?! You'll see soon enough. You... (groaning) (screaming) (repetitive thudding) (groaning) (screaming) What's happening? He talked? What you think? Why don't you roughen (mumbling)did?! [Prisoner] Uh, I don't know any... How do you expect him to talk then? Hm. All right. Now tell us who the four guys are then. Uh... I don't know, I don't. (groaning) Now, tell me what you know or I'll cut you. They're the four Chinese scientists. They were kidnapped by some people. Go on, now, who's the boss? (groaning) Dave, the Russian. And if you so much scratch me, he'll be very angry. Oh, I know, how could I possibly hurt my good buddy? So, tell me who the four guys are then! Dave arrive by train tomorrow. Why come here? He's buying the four scientists. Now, I don't believe you're telling us two the truth. Eh? Everything I've told you is the truth. Look, I live and you view our code. We first say: Welcome. He answers: Don't mention it. Then he says: Yah, yah, yah, four times... And then we say: Is the weather the good in Shanghai? And then he answers: Yes, yes, yes, four times exactly. Then he says: Is the weather gonna be good in Moscow? I'm telling the truth! Please! Then we say: I tell you that it's gonna be good. Please, don't kill me. (banging) (clattering) (groaning) (banging) (thudding) (laughing) (banging) (banging) (yelling) Go and see what's happening. Of course, sir. (thudding) (groaning) (gunfire) (gunfire) (groaning) (gunfire) (groaning) (dramatic music) Hold on! No shooting, they are brothers. If these men were to be hurt here, the Japanese ambassador would protest. It could cause easily an international incident. Mm-hm. That's him. Hm. Mr. Clay, give those four men. You have no right. They're not here. But I saw Joey. He made this hand gesture. Is that so? If this matter involves Joey, also involves the Wolves. Within three days, you send those men to me. Let's go. Hm. We have a problem. See to it. Yes, sir. My lord, my lord! The four men you seek! Where are they? In Lucky warehouse. (dramatic music) Boss, they know where we are. Nakamura is there on his way. Bring them. Hey, come on! No, no, no! Who are you? That doesn't matter, because you're under my control now. [Man] But what do you want from us? Tell me! Well, if it's all of your help, I'm gonna make a fortune. (laughing) Hey! [Prisoner] No! (groaning) Brothers, let's have a look. Yeah. (dramatic music) (gunfire) (groaning) (gunfire) Not yet. Go see where they got the experts. I'll cover you. (gunfire) Ken, they must have moved them away. They know, who are they? Nakamura. (gunfire) (groaning) (gunfire) (groaning) (gunfire) It must be the Wolves' spies. Huh? Mr. Clay, you are a liar and you've taken the four scientists for your very own use. Well, I tell you, someone's in taking advantage of us. What are you saying? Why the hell are you here? Hm. An informer passed this information on. Uh? Hm. Let's go. (footsteps) Sir. [Man] Hm? We found out that the Russians are involved. [Man] Hmm. Now find out who's caught them and whereabouts they're being held, and fast. Sir. And also the Tigress has got Jimmy now. [Man] Mm, that guy's a pain in the ass. Let him work it out for himself. Still, Jimmy's your man, it doesn't do to have him kidnapped, does it? (clicking) (grunting) Hmm. It's strange. I don't like this situation at all. The Wolves say they don't have these men. I wouldn't trust them. They're nothing but a real pack of thieves. Uh, they're not Wolves. I believe Mr. Clay. He wouldn't lie. He'd lose respect. Huh, maybe a third gang's involved. For instance... (chuckles) The Tigress' club's very powerful. Uh? Mm. (dramatic music) (tires screeching) (dramatic music) Who you're looking for? You can't enter. Go away. Where's Jimmy? (thudding) (groaning) (repetitive thudding) (groaning) Stop that! Who are you? How dare you come here without our permission?! Huh. Only the girls are allowed here. Huh. And special invited guests. So, tell me, which one are you, huh? (dramatic music) My name is Ken Yong, and I'm from the Wolves' group. I'm Ruth Brooks, head of the Tigresses. Jim's a good colleague, a friend. If he's been doing anything wrong, I'll see to it that he's punished punished. Punished? (chuckles) Come with me. (dramatic music) Oh, Master, come over here. This food is really delicious. It's so good, you must have some. Let's go. Come on. Uh? Hey, come on, I've only just started, and I thought I'd have dessert yet. Madam, thank you for everything you've done. (giggles) Madam, I did an invitation for Mr. Nakamura. Hm. So the Tigress is a friend of the Japanese. Do I understand correctly? I have many friends, Mr. Yong, as you will see. Tell him I'll be there at eight o'clock. Yes. As you have business to attend to, I should leave. Goodbye. Bye-bye. (moaning) Huh, infident! (dramatic music) Miss Brooks, welcome to my home. Take a seat, please. Huh! Nakamura, we have nothing in common, so I'm wondering just why we're having a cozy little dinner. Would you care to explain why? (chuckling) Madam, I want to know if you're holding four men, and so I asked you here in order to find out for myself. Oh! Who are they? (chuckling) They are experts in germ warfare. I know nothing. Really? Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. Mm. Ladies, I respect you for what you are and do, but don't mess with me. Otherwise I'll hurt you, and that would be a pity, a great pity. (chuckling) Mr. Nakamura, we're not playing games, so I suggest you leave us out. And, if you don't, you'll be the one who gets hurt. Huh? (claps hands) (dramatic music) (shushing) (repetitive thudding) But madam, the food is getting cold. What do you say? Here, have some food and a drink. No, thanks, I've lost my appetite. We'll be going. Till we meet again. Huh! (grunts) (dramatic music) I am Clay, leader of the Wolves' group. Ladies. I am Ruth Brooks, head of the Tigress' group. Sisters and brothers. Brothers and sisters. [Ruth] We serve one master. We serve one master. It's nice to meet you. And you, too. Sit. To reinforce our defenses, our government contracted four germ warfare experts. But Nakamura stole them. The Wolves offered to help the government and rescue the four from the Mitsui Company, but someone else has seized him. The Wolves have informants throughout the city of Shanghai, but nothing, not a word. We need some help, and therefore I ask the help from the Tigress for they also are wise, and they have informants. The country's in trouble. Then you can count on our help. I knew that I could trust you. Let us stand together, and so we can find these four men. (footsteps) Hm. Hey. Mh-hm. Hey. Hey, welcome. Welcome. Don't mention it. Yah, yah, yah, yah. Is the weather in Shanghai good? Yes, yes, yes, yes. (chuckling) Is it cold in Moscow? Yeah! Mm? All right. We'd better go. Where is the car? (chuckling) This is much better than a car, good exercise. Hey, come on. Let's go. Get it, get it, go on. Let's go. (electronic pop music) Hey, stop! Why, what's the matter? Where are we going? Oh, that's a secret. Mm. So why is it so deserted around here, huh? You're right, but our friends are just around that corner. (yelling) (repetitive thudding) (clinking) (whooshing) (groaning) (repetitive thudding) (clanking) (whooshing) (thudding) (whooshing) (panting) (dramatic music) (thudding) [Man] Sit down, come on! Don't move. Boss, I wonder where they could be. Russians are never late. Hide them away. Make sure they don't escape. (dramatic music) (rustling) (dramatic music) Ow! Hey, Mark, where, where's Master, huh? He's gone out for a while. Hey, can I help? Well, maybe you can help. It's a letter, in it's marked "Urgent." Hmm. Who delivered it? I didn't see. Hey, when will he be back? What if it's an emergency, life or death?! Hm. I'll open it and read it. [Mark] Hey. Hey. "The four scientists are being held" "at the Kingswood Company." Mm? Let's go. Hey. (dramatic music) Go there. Go. Let's go. Look. (dramatic music) (tires screeching) Hey, look there! Turn around. (tires screeching) They're trying to escape, aren't they? We'll see about that. (tires screeching) (dramatic music) (car engines roaring) (tires screeching) (gunfire) Andres, quick! (tires screeching) (gunfire) Get the men here. (gunfire) Come! All, come on, come on, come on, come on! (gunfire) (groaning) Come on (mumbling), you cover me, all right? Be careful, Jim. Oh, it's nothing, don't worry! (gunfire) Cover Jimmy. (gunfire) (groaning) (gunfire) Jimmy. Jimmy, are you okay, uh? (gunfire) Oh, Mark, hang on! Hang on, Mark! Please! (groaning) Mark! (sobbing) You should have waited, not rushed out like that. Well? I just opened that letter, and Mark said... And Mark said "Let's go." I didn't think. (sighing) Mark's sudden death is really a great loss to us. A very great loss. Yes, it is. We must find out who is responsible for this. One informant must have some sort of a lead that we can follow. Right, we must work harder, investigate everyone we can think of! Hm. Clay, with both squads working together, we're sure to flush someone out. We'll find them. (dramatic music) (groaning) [Guard] Go on. [Truman] Now what? Boss, Nakamura's blocked all the exits. Shanghai's been completely sealed. And the Wolves, and the Tigress too, they're all after us. What are we gonna do, uh? Hm. One last chance. What's that? Sell them to Nakamura. Brilliant. And he might even pay more money. Tell Nakamura he'll have these men, but it will cost him two tons of gold. We'll meet tomorrow, Sun Valley, at noon. Do you think you can remember that? Ace, now we're rich. (chucking) (dramatic music) [Nakamura] You smell beautiful tonight, my darling. (chuckling) You seem so happy. You've found your experts? (laughing) No, not yet, but everyone else is looking around for them, but they'll never find them now. (laughs) Why do you always know everything? Why everyone else chases their tail? Uh-huh. Because Mr. Truman wants to make a deal at noon at Sun Valley. (chuckles) Mm, you know... Uh? You're so clever. (laughing) (whispering) Miss Brooks, tell me, why are you so happy tonight? [Ruth] Huh, nothing special. Sir. Sir, miss, those scientists who escaped are being held by Mr. Truman. Mr. Nakamura has a deal going to get them in exchange for a big load of gold tomorrow. How do you know that? Uh, we just heard about it. All right, thanks anyway. Clay, is that true? These men are very reliable. I trust them. Come on. Hm. (suspense music) Nakamura, I've been waiting. I can't put this in my pocket, you know. I understand. Now, bring out the scientists. I keep my bargain. On your feet. Come on. (thudding) (groaning) Mm. Hm. (creaking) Very nice. Mr. Nakamura, you're a man of your word. That's good to see. Good. Now let's make a deal. [Man] Come on. Move it. Let's go. And you, move. (groaning) Go on. Open it. (groaning) Come on! (cheering) We're rich now! Truman, aren't you afraid that I'll kill you after? (laughing) I wouldn't come unless other precautions, like you, I think. (dramatic music) Hm. You're all right, you're okay. Well, now I'm flattered. That praise indeed... (dramatic music) Truman, Nakamura, get out of here! Nakamura, they're after the scientists. Hmm. Don't forget, we're both involved in this. We both lose. And we're both gonna have to fight together. Hm. If you can beat them, the gold is yours. And anything else you want, it's all yours. Okay. Men, get ready. Let's go! (gunfire) (bursting) Ah, Ninjas! (gunfire) They're both fighting together against us. It doesn't matter. We'll still win. Fire! (gunfire) Nakamura, we can't hide here. Right. Move all the men here, quickly! Hey, stop firing! Or I'll kill them! I mean, I'll kill them right now! (gunfire) Stop! Bastards! They can't fight, so they hide! Wait a minute, just a minute. It's Ken's duty to save them. Let's go. [Man] Let's go. (mumbling) (Chinese instrumental music) Nakamura, remember your promise to me? (chuckling) Nakamura, remember your promise to me? (chuckling) Of course. Whatever you want, you got it. (chuckling) I want her. Uh? Uh? What? Nakamura, changed you heart? Well... All right. Go to him. Hm. Go to him. Oh. (chuckling) Thanks for your gift. We'll be next door. (chuckling) (cheering) (Chinese instrumental music) It's a pity. Such a beautiful woman wasted! Well, I made a promise, and now you'll make another one. So promise me. (chuckling) I can promise you that I can do it. (Chinese instrumental music) (moaning) Uh? (gunfire) (groaning) (phone rings) Wolves' Squad. Uh, it's for you. Hello, it's Ken. Huh? Spy number two. Oh! The four experts are at Mitsui. That right? Really? Hmm. Hm. We got a lead. Let's get going. (Chinese instrumental music) (laughing) A man without principles should not live. Such a man (mumbling). Nakamura, you failed me. Uh? Uh. Such a beautiful gift. I'm returning it! (screams) No, once it is given, cannot be returned. This gift is not just our gift, she's a slave of both our pleasure. Oh! (laughing) (screaming) (clapping hands) (car engine roaring) Hurry now. Mr. Nakamura's an impatient man. He should make an appointment, like everyone else. I had not time to make up. (chuckling) Hey, who are you looking for? We're Mr. Nakamura's guests. Well, he's out. Oh, of course he's out, he's still eating dinner. He asked us all to go back to his house and wait for him. Let's go. Uh. Uh, ladies, you'd better wait outside. Wait? Wait outside? [Guard] Huh. Who do you think we are? [Girl] I'll tell Mr. Nakamura when he gets back. Yes, we all wait here. [The rest of the girls] All right. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Hey, ladies, you can't wait out here! All right, you can go inside then. (laughing) That's better. (footsteps) (car doors slamming shut) (car engines roaring) (dramatic music) (groaning) (men murmuring) [Man] Come on, I really want your hand. [Man] Full house. (laughing) [Man] Can I see you again? [Girl] Quick! (groaning) (groaning) (yelling) The keys. (whooshing) (yelling) (repetitive thudding) (yelling) (repetitive thudding) (splashing) (thudding) (groaning) (dramatic music) (laughing) Things are going well. Yeah, very well. (laughing) (gunfire) (whooshing) (groaning) (whooshing) (groaning) Let's get out of here. Come on. Yeah. [All girls] Come on. (ominous music) It's a sign. The sign of the Wolves. Who are you? Brothers and sisters of the same cause, the Wolves are brothers, there's no separating us. Come with us, quick! Come on! [Man] All right, move. Let's go. (dramatic music) (gunfire) (laughing) You're rich. (gunfire) Hurry up, cover her. (gunfire) (mumbling) Don't! (gunfire) (groaning) Uh, Ona! (groaning) Ona, are you all right? Stay here, she's gone. (dramatic music) (laughing) Yeah, we've both. (gunfire) (groaning) Oh, oh, no, oh, no! Talk to me. Say, something, say something. No time for talking, you must go. (dramatic music) Hurry, let's get out of here! Let's go! (gunfire) (groaning) (dramatic music) (car engine roaring) It's a raid. Tigress, no doubt. Hm. (dramatic music) (intense dramatic music) My ninjas will fix them. You'll all die very soon! Let's go. (dramatic music) [Man] Welcome, gentlemen. Good to meet you. (dramatic music) Mm, good very good. We're all highly trained ninjas. Your job is to help me kill my enemies. They've employed two ninjas to fight against me. That's why I asked you all here how to help. To deal with a ninja, there must be a ninja. You can rely on us. Well, I'm both happy and relieved to hear it. I'm sure that you boys can take care of these two quite easily. You must win! Good. Okay, let's go. (dramatic music) (car engine roaring) (dramatic music) Sir, we shall not forget your great kindness. Goodbye. You, man, averted the possible outbreak of germ warfare. We thank you, sincerely. Well, it's the least that we could do. It's time to go. All right. We'll go first. Hm. (car engine roaring) Follow them. (mumbling) (dramatic music) (moaning) Well, Nakamura... Hm? Do you think they're gonna show their faces? (laughing) Don't worry. If they want their number two spy back, they'll be here. (dramatic music) Shit! They're late! It's a pity to waste her. How long will we wait? Huh? Shoot her! (dramatic music) Fire! (gunfire) (screaming) (gunfire) [Man] Up! [Nakamura] Hey, shoot her! Get them! (gunfire) (groaning) (dramatic music) (gunfire) (yelling) (gunfire) There's where they're hiding. Hey! Come on here! Fire if you got the guts! (gunfire) (dramatic music) (gunfire) (groaning) (gunfire) (groaning) I'll save Eliza. Jimmy, leave me here. Hey, what do you want?! Hey, shoot that guy! (gunfire) (groaning) (gunfire) Damn! That guy, the young bastard's set her free! Nakamura, don't worry, watch this. Hey, what are you doing? Don't forget, I was an assassin. Let me show you something special. Okay. (dramatic music) [Steven] It's Eliza. Go, come on! (dramatic music) Quickly! (thudding) (yelling) (dramatic music) (yelling) (whooshing) (dramatic music) Okay, men, you all know what to do. Go get them. Yes, sir! Let's go, move! Listen, we must outsmart them to win this one, okay? Go. (dramatic music) [Ruth and Clay] Attack! Fire out.

(Nakamura grunts) Oh, save me, save me! (gunfire) (groaning) I wonder what's happened to Ken. Oh, he can look after himself. Don't worry about him. (yelling) (dramatic music) (whooshing) (gunfire) (groaning) (gunfire) (whooshing) (gunfire) (dramatic music) (yelling) (clanging) (thudding) (whooshing) Hey, huh, huh, hey!

Don't worry, I'm okay. Let's go. (gunfire) (groaning) (gunfire) (groaning) Nakamura, drop your weapon. No way!

You go first. [Eliza] Thank you. (groaning) Jimmy. Jimmy! I've taken my revenge... For Mark. (groans) Jimmy! (groans) Jimmy! Now it's time to identify myself. I'm spy number two, together with Alex and Steve, and I worked to rescue the germ warfare experts... And save our country. And now we've completed our mission. (groans) Eliza. Eliza! You saved our country! Uh. (groans) (dramatic music)
